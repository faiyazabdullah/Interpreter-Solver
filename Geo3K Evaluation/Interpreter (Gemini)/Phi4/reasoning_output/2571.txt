1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle \( C \) with points \( E, F, G, \) and \( H \) lying on it. Two chords, \( \overline{EH} \) and \( \overline{FG} \), intersect at point \( J \).
   - We have arcs \( \overset{\frown}{EF} \) and \( \overset{\frown}{GH} \) with their measures given as algebraic expressions involving a variable \( X \).
   - We need to find the value of \( X \) such that the measures of these arcs are equal.

2. **Geometric Considerations:**
   - Since \( E, F, G, \) and \( H \) are on the circle, \( \overline{EH} \) and \( \overline{FG} \) are chords.
   - The problem states that the measures of arcs \( \overset{\frown}{EF} \) and \( \overset{\frown}{GH} \) are equal.

3. **Equations from the Problem:**
   - Measure of arc \( \overset{\frown}{EF} \) is given by \( 10X - 4 \).
   - Measure of arc \( \overset{\frown}{GH} \) is given by \( 8X + 6 \).
   - Since these measures are equal, we set up the equation:
     \[
     10X - 4 = 8X + 6
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( X \):
     \[
     10X - 8X = 6 + 4
     \]
     \[
     2X = 10
     \]
     \[
     X = 5
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Substitute \( X = 5 \) back into the expressions for the arc measures to verify:
     - Measure of arc \( \overset{\frown}{EF} \): \( 10(5) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \)
     - Measure of arc \( \overset{\frown}{GH} \): \( 8(5) + 6 = 40 + 6 = 46 \)
   - Both measures are indeed equal, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( X = 5 \) matches choice B.
