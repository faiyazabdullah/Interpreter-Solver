**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have points A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- Line segments DC and AE are given.
- Angle DEA is formed by the intersection of lines DC and AE at point E.
- Angle DEB is another angle formed by extending line AE to B.
- It is given that Angle DEA is a right angle, i.e., its measure is 90 degrees.
- The sum of the measures of Angle DEA and Angle DEB is 180 degrees.
- Measure of Angle DEB is denoted by x.
- Point E lies on both Line DC and Line AE.
- Line AE is perpendicular to Line DC.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since Angle DEA is a right angle, MeasureOf(Angle DEA) = 90 degrees.
- The sum of the measures of Angle DEA and Angle DEB is given as 180 degrees.
- Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle DEA) + MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 180 degrees.
- Substitute the known measure of Angle DEA: 90 + MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 180.

**Step 3: Brainstorm and Apply Geometric Theorems**

- From the equation 90 + MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 180, we can solve for MeasureOf(Angle DEB).
- MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 180 - 90.
- MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 90 degrees.

**Step 4: Verify and Refine Calculations**

- We have determined that MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 90 degrees.
- This means x = 90 degrees, as x is defined as MeasureOf(Angle DEB).

**Step 5: Reassess and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of x is 90 degrees.
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 45, B. 90, C. 180, D. 360.
- The calculated value matches choice B.

**Step 6: Final Reflection and Conclusion**

- All steps align with the given constraints and geometric properties.
- The calculated value of x is consistent with the problem's requirements.
- The closest and correct answer choice is B. 90.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the measure of Angle DEB, denoted as x, is 90 degrees. This is derived from the fact that Angle DEA is a right angle and the sum of angles DEA and DEB is 180 degrees, leading to MeasureOf(Angle DEB) = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
