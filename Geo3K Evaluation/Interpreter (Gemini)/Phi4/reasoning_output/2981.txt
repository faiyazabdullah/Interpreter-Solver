1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus \(ABCD\) with \(AD\) as a base.
   - The length of \(AD\) is 22.
   - The height from base \(AD\) to the opposite side (either \(BC\) or the height between \(A\) and line \(BC\)) is 12.

2. **Identifying What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of the rhombus \(ABCD\).

3. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - Here, the base is \(AD\) and the height is given as 12.

4. **Performing Calculations:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = 22 \times 12
     \]
   - Calculate the product:
     \[
     22 \times 12 = 264
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - The calculation is straightforward and uses the correct formula for the area of a rhombus given a base and height.

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 264.
   - Compare this result with the given answer choices: A. 33, B. 66, C. 132, D. 264.
   - The calculated area matches option D.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option D.
</think>

**Solution:**

The area of the rhombus \(ABCD\) is calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus, \(\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}\). With \(AD\) as the base (22 units) and the height from \(AD\) to the opposite side being 12 units, the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = 22 \times 12 = 264
\]

The calculated area matches option D.
