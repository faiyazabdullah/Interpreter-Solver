1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a trapezoid \(T R S V\) with \(T R\) and \(S V\) as the bases, and \(T V\) and \(R S\) as the legs.
   - \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of the legs \(T V\) and \(R S\) respectively.
   - \(M N\) is parallel to the bases \(T R\) and \(S V\).
   - The length of \(T R\) is given as 32, and the length of \(M N\) is 25.
   - The length of \(M N\) is the average of the lengths of the bases \(T R\) and \(S V\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \(S V\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \(M N\) is the median of the trapezoid, its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Length of } M N = \frac{\text{Length of } T R + \text{Length of } S V}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     25 = \frac{32 + \text{Length of } S V}{2}
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     50 = 32 + \text{Length of } S V
     \]
   - Subtract 32 from both sides to solve for the length of \(S V\):
     \[
     \text{Length of } S V = 50 - 32 = 18
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \(S V\) is 18.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 18
     - B. 36
     - C. 50
     - D. 64
   - The calculated result matches option A.

6. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - Since the calculated length of \(S V\) is 18, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and the properties of the trapezoid, the length of \(S V\) is 18. This matches option A from the given choices.

Final Answer: A
