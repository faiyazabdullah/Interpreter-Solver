**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle BAC \) being the right angle.
- The hypotenuse of the triangle is \( \overline{BC} \) with a length of 25.5.
- The side \( \overline{AC} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{AB} \) and has a length of 12.
- We need to find the length of \( \overline{AB} \), denoted as \( x \).

**Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
\text{Square of the hypotenuse} = \text{Square of one leg} + \text{Square of the other leg}
\]

For \( \triangle ABC \), this translates to:

\[
\text{Square of } \overline{BC} = \text{Square of } \overline{AB} + \text{Square of } \overline{AC}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
25.5^2 = x^2 + 12^2
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Squares**

Calculate \( 25.5^2 \) and \( 12^2 \):

\[
25.5^2 = 650.25
\]
\[
12^2 = 144
\]

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**

Substitute these values into the equation:

\[
650.25 = x^2 + 144
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( x^2 \)**

Subtract 144 from both sides to solve for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 650.25 - 144
\]
\[
x^2 = 506.25
\]

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \)**

Take the square root of both sides to find \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{506.25}
\]

Calculate the square root:

\[
x \approx 22.5
\]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \( x \) is 22.5. Among the given answer choices:

- A. 22.5
- B. 23
- C. 23.5
- D. 24

The closest value to 22.5 is option A.

**Step 8: Verify**

Reassess the calculations to ensure accuracy. The steps followed the Pythagorean theorem correctly, and the arithmetic checks out.

**Step 9: Select the Final Answer**

The closest answer choice to the calculated value of \( x \) is 22.5.

<Solution>

Based on the application of the Pythagorean theorem and the calculations performed, the value of \( x \) is determined to be 22.5. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
