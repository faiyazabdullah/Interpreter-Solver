**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have two lines, \(m\) and \(n\), which are parallel: \( \parallel \) Line(m), Line(n).
- Points A and C are given, forming angles \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \).
- The measures of these angles are given by two equations:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) = 4x - 23
  \]
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle C) = 2x + 17
  \]
- It is also given that \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle C) \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \) are equal, and lines \(m\) and \(n\) are parallel, \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \) could be corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or any angles that are equal due to parallelism.

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**
- Since \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle C) \), we can equate the two expressions:
  \[
  4x - 23 = 2x + 17
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \(x\)**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
  \[
  4x - 2x = 17 + 23
  \]
  \[
  2x = 40
  \]
  \[
  x = 20
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- Substitute \(x = 20\) back into the expressions for the angles to ensure they are equal:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) = 4(20) - 23 = 80 - 23 = 57
  \]
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle C) = 2(20) + 17 = 40 + 17 = 57
  \]
- Both angles are indeed equal, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(x\) is 20, which matches one of the provided answer choices.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**
- Since the calculated value \(x = 20\) matches choice B, we select B.

**Step 8: Conclude with the Final Answer**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is B.

</think>

**Solution:**

To find the value of \(x\) that ensures lines \(m\) and \(n\) are parallel, we equated the measures of angles \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \) because they are given to be equal. Solving the equation \(4x - 23 = 2x + 17\), we found \(x = 20\). This value satisfies the condition that the measures of both angles are equal, confirming the parallelism of lines \(m\) and \(n\).

Final Answer: B
