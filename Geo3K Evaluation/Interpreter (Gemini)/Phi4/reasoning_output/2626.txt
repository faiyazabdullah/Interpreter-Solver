**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have a parallelogram ABCD with points A, B, C, and D.
- Line segments AD and BC are parallel, and AB and DC are parallel (properties of a parallelogram).
- Lengths: AD = 10, BD = 6.
- Line BD is perpendicular to line AD, indicating ∠ADB is a right angle.
- Since ∠ADB is a right angle, triangle ABD is a right triangle.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the area of parallelogram ABCD.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: Area = base × height.
- In parallelogram ABCD, AD can be considered as the base.
- Since BD is perpendicular to AD, BD acts as the height corresponding to base AD.

**Step 4: Calculate the Area**
- Base (AD) = 10.
- Height (BD) = 6.
- Therefore, the area of parallelogram ABCD = base × height = 10 × 6 = 60.

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Given Answer Choices**
- The calculated area is 60.
- The answer choices are: A. 24, B. 30, C. 48, D. 60.
- The calculated area matches choice D.

**Step 6: Verify and Reflect**
- Reassess calculations: AD = 10, BD = 6, and they are perpendicular, so the area calculation is correct.
- The area formula used is appropriate for the given geometric configuration.

**Step 7: Conclusion**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is D. 60.

**Solution:**

The area of parallelogram ABCD is calculated using the base AD and the height BD, where AD = 10 and BD = 6. Since BD is perpendicular to AD, the area is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 10 \times 6 = 60
\]

Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is D. 60.

Final Answer: D
