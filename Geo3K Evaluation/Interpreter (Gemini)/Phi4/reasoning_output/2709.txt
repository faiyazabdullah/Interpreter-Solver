**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints**
- Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
- Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on a line \( AD \).
- Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on Circle \( J \).
- Points \( B \) and \( C \) lie on Circle \( K \).
- The length of \( BC \) is 5.4 units.
- \( JK \) is a line that passes through centers \( J \) and \( K \).

**Step 2: Understand the geometric setup**
- Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are collinear.
- \( JA \) and \( JB \) are radii of Circle \( J \), so \( JA = JB = 10 \).
- \( KC \) and \( KD \) are radii of Circle \( K \), so \( KC = KD = 8 \).
- The length \( KC \) is given as 8, confirming \( C \) is on Circle \( K \).

**Step 3: Determine the position of points \( B \) and \( C \)**
- Since \( B \) and \( C \) are on Circle \( K \), and \( KC = 8 \), \( C \) is on Circle \( K \).
- \( BC = 5.4 \).

**Step 4: Calculate \( CK \)**
- We need to find \( CK \), which is the radius of Circle \( K \) and is given as 8.
- Since \( CK = 8 \), and \( B \) and \( C \) are on Circle \( K \), we need to find the distance from \( C \) to \( K \).

**Step 5: Use the given information**
- \( CK = 8 \) is already given, but we need to find \( CK \) in terms of the distance from \( C \) to \( K \) along the line \( AD \).

**Step 6: Apply the Pythagorean theorem**
- Consider the triangle \( BCK \) where \( BK \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( BK = 8 \) (radius of Circle \( K \)).
- \( BC = 5.4 \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCK \):
\[
BK^2 = BC^2 + CK^2
\]
\[
8^2 = 5.4^2 + CK^2
\]
\[
64 = 29.16 + CK^2
\]
\[
CK^2 = 64 - 29.16
\]
\[
CK^2 = 34.84
\]
\[
CK = \sqrt{34.84} \approx 5.9
\]

**Step 7: Calculate \( CK \) using the correct setup**
- Since \( CK = 8 \) is the radius, and \( BC = 5.4 \), the distance \( CK \) along the line \( AD \) can be found by considering the segment \( CK \) as part of the line \( AD \).

**Step 8: Correct calculation**
- Since \( CK = 8 \) and \( BC = 5.4 \), the distance from \( C \) to \( K \) along the line is:
\[
CK = 8 - 5.4 = 2.6
\]

**Step 9: Verify the calculations**
- The calculation \( CK = 8 - 5.4 = 2.6 \) is consistent with the setup where \( C \) is on Circle \( K \) and \( BC = 5.4 \).

**Step 10: Compare with answer choices**
- The calculated \( CK = 2.6 \) matches option B.

**Final Answer: B**
</think>

**Solution:**
Given the geometric constraints and calculations, the distance \( CK \) is found to be 2.6 units. This matches option B.

Final Answer: B
