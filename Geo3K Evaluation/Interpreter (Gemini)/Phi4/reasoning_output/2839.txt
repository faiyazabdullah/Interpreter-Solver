1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle \( K \) with a diameter \( JL \). The line segment \( JL \) is the diameter, which means that \( J, K, L \) lie on a straight line and \( K \) is the center of the circle.
   - The length of \( JL \) is given as \( x \).
   - The measure of angle \( JKL \) is 180 degrees, confirming \( JL \) as the diameter.
   - The area of a shaded region \( A \) is given as 66 cm², which corresponds to the area of the circle \( K \).

2. **Summarize the Relevant Findings:**
   - The diameter of the circle \( K \) is \( x \).
   - The radius of circle \( K \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The area of the circle \( K \) can be expressed using the formula for the area of a circle: \( \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.

3. **Apply Relevant Formulas:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a circle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{x^2}{4}
     \]
   - We know the area \( A \) of the circle is 66 cm²:
     \[
     \pi \frac{x^2}{4} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{66 \times 4}{\pi}
     \]
   - Calculate \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{264}{\pi}
     \]
   - Approximate \( \pi \) as 3.14 for calculation:
     \[
     x^2 \approx \frac{264}{3.14} \approx 84.076
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) by taking the square root:
     \[
     x \approx \sqrt{84.076} \approx 9.17
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \approx 9.17 \).
   - The closest answer choice to 9.17 is 13.0.

6. **Verify and Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Verify calculations and logic used.
   - The closest choice to the calculated \( x \approx 9.17 \) is 13.0, which is option C.

</think>
**Solution:**

The steps followed in the thought process reveal that the correct value of \( x \), given the constraints and calculations, is closest to 13.0. Therefore, the answer is:
