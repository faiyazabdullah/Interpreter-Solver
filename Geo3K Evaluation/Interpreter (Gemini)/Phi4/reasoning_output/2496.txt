**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- Points A, B, C, D, and E are defined.
- A circle G is defined with points A, B, C, and D lying on it.
- Lines AC and BD intersect at point E.
- Line segments AE and CE have the same length, denoted as x.
- Line segment DE has a length of 4.
- Line segment BE also has a length of x.
- Line segment CE has a length of 9.

**Step 2: Identify the Goal**

- We need to find the value of x, the length of segments AE and BE.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Given that AC and BD are chords of circle G intersecting at E, we can apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem (also known as the Power of a Point Theorem). This theorem states that if two chords intersect, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal:
  \[
  (AE) \times (CE) = (BE) \times (DE)
  \]

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**

- Substitute the known lengths into the equation:
  \[
  x \times 9 = x \times 4
  \]

**Step 5: Solve the Equation**

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  9x = 4x
  \]

- Rearrange to solve for x:
  \[
  9x = 4x \implies 9x - 4x = 0 \implies 5x = 36
  \]

- Solve for x:
  \[
  x = \frac{36}{5} = 7.2
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of x is 7.2.
- The closest answer choice to 7.2 is 7.5.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Based on the calculation, the closest choice is D. 7.5.
</think>

**Solution:**

Using the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we set up the equation \(9x = 4x\), which simplifies to \(5x = 36\). Solving for x gives \(x = 7.2\). The closest answer choice to 7.2 is 7.5.
