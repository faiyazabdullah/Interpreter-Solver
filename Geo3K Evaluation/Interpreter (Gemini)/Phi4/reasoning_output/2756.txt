**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two triangles: \(\triangle WZX\) and \(\triangle SRT\).
- \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\) (the triangles are similar).
- The length of line \(WX\) is given as 5.
- The length of line \(ST\) is given as 6.
- The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is given as 15.

**Step 2: Understand the Requirements**

- We need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\).
- Use the properties of similar triangles, particularly the ratio of corresponding sides and the ratio of perimeters.

**Step 3: Apply Properties of Similar Triangles**

- Since \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\), the corresponding sides are proportional.
- The ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their perimeters.

**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Corresponding Sides**

- Given: \(WX = 5\) and \(ST = 6\).
- The ratio of corresponding sides is \(\frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}\).

**Step 5: Use the Ratio to Find the Perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\)**

- The ratio of the perimeters of similar triangles is the same as the ratio of their corresponding sides.
- Let \(P_{WZX}\) be the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\).
- Then, \(\frac{P_{WZX}}{15} = \frac{5}{6}\).

**Step 6: Solve for \(P_{WZX}\)**

- \(\frac{P_{WZX}}{15} = \frac{5}{6}\)
- Cross-multiply to solve for \(P_{WZX}\):
  \[
  6 \times P_{WZX} = 5 \times 15
  \]
  \[
  6 \times P_{WZX} = 75
  \]
  \[
  P_{WZX} = \frac{75}{6} = 12.5
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is 12.5.
- The closest answer choice is A. 12.5.

<Solution>

Based on the calculations and the properties of similar triangles, the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is 12.5. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
