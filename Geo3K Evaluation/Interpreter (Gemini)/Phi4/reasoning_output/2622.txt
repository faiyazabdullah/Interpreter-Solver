<think>
1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus \(ABCD\) with an area of 36 square units.
   - The length of diagonal \(AD\) is 8 units.
   - \(AD\) is an altitude of the rhombus.
   - Another shape, referred to as Shape(1), is similar to the rhombus and has an altitude of 4 units.
   - Shape(1) is green in color.

2. **Summarizing Findings:**
   - A rhombus's area can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
     where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.
   - Given that the area is 36 and \(d_1 = 8\), we can find \(d_2\).
   - The altitude of the rhombus is 4 units (since \(AD\) is perpendicular to \(BC\) and acts as an altitude).

3. **Calculating the Unknown Diagonal:**
   - Using the area formula:
     \[
     36 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times d_2
     \]
   - Solving for \(d_2\):
     \[
     36 = 4 \times d_2 \implies d_2 = 9
     \]

4. **Understanding Similarity:**
   - Shape(1) is similar to rhombus \(ABCD\), meaning all corresponding linear dimensions are proportional.
   - The altitude of Shape(1) is 4 units, which is half the altitude of the rhombus.

5. **Determining the Scale Factor:**
   - Since the altitude of Shape(1) is half that of the rhombus, the scale factor \(k\) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

6. **Calculating the Area of Shape(1):**
   - The area of similar figures is proportional to the square of the scale factor.
   - If the scale factor is \( \frac{1}{2} \), then the area of Shape(1) is:
     \[
     \text{Area of Shape(1)} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times 36 = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
     \]

7. **Verification:**
   - The calculated area of Shape(1) is 9, which matches one of the answer choices.
   - No further calculations are needed as the problem constraints and similarity conditions are satisfied.

8. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated area of the green figure (Shape(1)) is 9, which directly matches option A.

</think>

**Solution:**
- The area of the green figure, Shape(1), is calculated using the properties of similar figures and the given geometric constraints.
- The area of the rhombus is 36, and the scale factor between the rhombus and Shape(1) is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Therefore, the area of Shape(1) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the rhombus, which is 9.
- The correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
