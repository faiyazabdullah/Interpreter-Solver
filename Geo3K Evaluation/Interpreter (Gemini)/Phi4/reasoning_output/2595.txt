PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two circles: Circle \( \odot R \) with a diameter of 20 units, and Circle \( \odot S \) with a diameter of 30 units.
   - The radius of Circle \( \odot R \) is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) units, and the radius of Circle \( \odot S \) is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) units.
   - Points \( C \) and \( D \) lie on Circle \( \odot R \), and points \( D \), \( B \), and \( S \) lie on Circle \( \odot S \).
   - Points \( R \), \( C \), \( D \), \( S \), and \( B \) all lie on the line \( \overline{RBS} \).
   - The length \( DS = 9 \) units.
   - \( RC \) is a radius of Circle \( \odot R \), so \( RC = 10 \) units.
   - \( SB \) is a radius of Circle \( \odot S \), so \( SB = 15 \) units.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the length \( RC \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( R \) is the center of Circle \( \odot R \) and \( C \) lies on this circle, \( RC \) is the radius of Circle \( \odot R \).
   - We are given that the radius of Circle \( \odot R \) is 10 units.

4. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - We have already established that \( RC = 10 \) units based on the radius of Circle \( \odot R \).
   - We need to ensure this aligns with the constraints and the answer choices.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are: A. 4, B. 6, C. 9, D. 12.
   - The calculated \( RC = 10 \) does not match any of the given choices directly.
   - We must select the closest value to 10 from the options provided.

6. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest value to 10 among the choices is 9.

7. **Final Verification:**
   - Reassess the problem constraints and calculations to ensure no steps were missed.
   - The closest match to the calculated \( RC = 10 \) is indeed 9.

</think>

<Solution>
Given the constraints and calculations, the length \( RC \) is determined to be 10 units based on the radius of Circle \( \odot R \). Since 10 is not an option, the closest value to 10 among the provided choices is 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
</Solution>
