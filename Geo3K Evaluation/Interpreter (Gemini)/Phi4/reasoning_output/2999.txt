**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a square \(A, C, F, D\) and a circle \(H\) circumscribed to this square.
   - The circle is tangent to all sides of the square.
   - Points \(E, I, M, G\) lie on both the circle and the respective lines \(AC, CF, FD, DA\).
   - Lines \(AD\), \(DF\), \(FC\), \(CA\) are perpendicular to each other, indicating a standard orientation of a square.
   - The line \(DF\) has a length of 14 and is also the diameter of circle \(H\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the circumference of circle \(H\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(DF\) is the diameter of the circle, the diameter \(d\) of circle \(H\) is 14.
   - The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by \(C = \pi \times d\).

4. **Show All Calculations:**
   - Using the diameter \(d = 14\), the circumference \(C\) is:
     \[
     C = \pi \times 14 = 14\pi
     \]

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Given Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated circumference is \(14\pi\).
   - Compare this with the answer choices: 
     - A. \(7\pi\)
     - B. \(14\pi\)
     - C. \(21\pi\)
     - D. \(28\pi\)

6. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated circumference \(14\pi\) matches exactly with option B.

7. **Reassess and Verify:**
   - All given constraints and calculations align with the properties of a square circumscribed by a circle.
   - The perpendicular nature of the lines confirms the square's orientation and validates the diameter as a diagonal of the square.

**Conclusion:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the geometric constraints, and the choice \(14\pi\) is accurate.

**Solution Section:**

The circumference of circle \(H\), given that its diameter is 14, is calculated as \(14\pi\). This matches exactly with option B.

Final Answer: B
