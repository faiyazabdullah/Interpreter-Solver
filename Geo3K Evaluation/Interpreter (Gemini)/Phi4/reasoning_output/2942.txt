**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints**

- We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A, B, C \).
- The lengths \( AB \) and \( AC \) are both 9.
- The measure of angle \( A \) is 60 degrees.
- The triangle is isosceles and equilateral, implying \( AB = AC = BC \).
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, all sides are congruent, and all angles are 60 degrees.

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings**

- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, all sides are equal.
- Given \( AB = AC = 9 \), it follows that \( BC \) must also be 9.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric properties**

- In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 60 degrees.
- Therefore, if \( AB = AC = 9 \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, then \( BC = 9 \).

**Step 4: Verify the accuracy of the current steps**

- The conditions \( AB = AC = 9 \) and \( \angle A = 60^\circ \) confirm that \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral.
- Thus, \( BC = 9 \) is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.

**Step 5: Compare with answer choices**

- The calculated length of \( BC \) is 9.
- Among the answer choices, the correct one is B. 9.

**Step 6: Finalize the solution**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the length of \( BC \) is indeed 9.

**Solution**

Given the constraints and properties of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we determined that it is equilateral with all sides equal. Since \( AB = AC = 9 \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, \( BC \) must also be 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
