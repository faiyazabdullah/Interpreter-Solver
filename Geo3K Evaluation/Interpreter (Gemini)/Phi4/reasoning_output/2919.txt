### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- We have a rhombus \(ABXC\) with diagonals \(AX\) and \(BC\).
- One diagonal (\(AX\)) is twice the length of the other diagonal (\(BC\)).
- The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.
- The formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals is: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations
- Let the length of diagonal \(BC\) be \(x\).
- Then the length of diagonal \(AX\) is \(2x\) (since \(AX\) is twice \(BC\)).
- Substitute these into the area formula:
  \[
  169 = \frac{1}{2} \times (2x) \times x
  \]
  \[
  169 = x^2
  \]

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
- Solve the equation \(x^2 = 169\):
  \[
  x = \sqrt{169} = 13
  \]
- Therefore, the length of diagonal \(BC\) is 13 mm.

### Step 4: Find the Length of Diagonal \(AX\)
- Since \(AX = 2x\), substitute \(x = 13\):
  \[
  AX = 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ mm}
  \]

### Step 5: Verify the Calculations
- Check the area with these diagonal lengths:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 \times 13 = \frac{1}{2} \times 338 = 169 \text{ square millimeters}
  \]
- The calculated area matches the given area, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm and 26 mm.
- Compare these with the answer choices:
  - A. 6.5
  - B. 13
  - C. 26
  - D. 52
- The lengths match options B (13) and C (26).

### Step 7: Select the Closest Answer
- Since both diagonal lengths are required, and both 13 and 26 are present in the options, we consider the longer diagonal as the primary answer due to the problem's emphasis on one diagonal being twice the other.
- Therefore, the length of the longer diagonal is 26 mm.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and analysis, the lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm and 26 mm. The longer diagonal, which is twice the shorter one, is 26 mm. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C. 26.
