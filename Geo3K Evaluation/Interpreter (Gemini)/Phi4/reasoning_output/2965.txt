**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle WXY \) with sides \( WX \), \( XY \), and \( WY \).
   - The side lengths are given by:
     - \( \text{Length of } WX = 9x \)
     - \( \text{Length of } XY = 4x + 5 \)
     - \( \text{Length of } WY = 6x + 3 \)
   - The triangle is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal:
     - \( WX = XY = WY \)

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Equilateral Property:**
   - Since \( WX = XY \), we have:
     \[
     9x = 4x + 5
     \]
   - Since \( XY = WY \), we have:
     \[
     4x + 5 = 6x + 3
     \]
   - Since \( WY = WX \), we have:
     \[
     6x + 3 = 9x
     \]

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Solve \( 9x = 4x + 5 \):
     \[
     9x - 4x = 5 \implies 5x = 5 \implies x = 1
     \]

   - Solve \( 4x + 5 = 6x + 3 \):
     \[
     4x + 5 = 6x + 3 \implies 5 - 3 = 6x - 4x \implies 2 = 2x \implies x = 1
     \]

   - Solve \( 6x + 3 = 9x \):
     \[
     6x + 3 = 9x \implies 3 = 9x - 6x \implies 3 = 3x \implies x = 1
     \]

4. **Verify Consistency:**
   - All equations consistently give \( x = 1 \).
   - Check if \( x = 1 \) satisfies all side length conditions:
     - \( WX = 9(1) = 9 \)
     - \( XY = 4(1) + 5 = 9 \)
     - \( WY = 6(1) + 3 = 9 \)
   - All sides are equal, confirming the equilateral property.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 1 \) matches choice A.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution is consistent with the given constraints and the calculated value matches one of the provided answer choices.

**Solution Section:**

Based on the analysis and solving of the equations derived from the equilateral property of the triangle, we find that \( x = 1 \) satisfies all conditions. This value is consistent across all equations and confirms the equilateral nature of the triangle. Therefore, the correct answer is:
