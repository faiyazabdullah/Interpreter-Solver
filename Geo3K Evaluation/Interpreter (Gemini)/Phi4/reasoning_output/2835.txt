1. **Analyze the Problem:** 
   - We have a square inscribed in a circle. The circle's area is given as \(18\pi\) square units.
   - We need to find the length of a side of the square.

2. **Summarize Geometric Relations:**
   - The square is inscribed in the circle, meaning its diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - The area of the circle is \(18\pi\), so we can find the radius using the formula for the area of a circle: \( \pi r^2 = 18\pi \).

3. **Calculate the Radius:**
   - From \(\pi r^2 = 18\pi\), divide both sides by \(\pi\) to get \(r^2 = 18\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we find \(r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

4. **Find the Diameter:**
   - The diameter \(d\) of the circle is twice the radius: \(d = 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\).

5. **Relate the Diagonal of the Square to the Diameter:**
   - Since the square is inscribed, its diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the diagonal of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\).

6. **Use the Diagonal to Find the Side Length of the Square:**
   - For a square with side length \(s\), the diagonal \(d\) is given by \(d = s\sqrt{2}\).
   - Set the diagonal equal to the circle's diameter: \(s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\).
   - Solve for \(s\) by dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\): \(s = 6\).

7. **Verify and Compare:**
   - The calculated side length of the square is 6.
   - Compare this with the answer choices: A. 3, B. \(3\sqrt{2}\), C. 6, D. \(6\sqrt{2}\).
   - The calculated side length matches option C.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of a side of the square is 6.
</think>

<Solution>
- Given the area of the circle is \(18\pi\), we calculated the radius as \(3\sqrt{2}\).
- The diameter of the circle, and thus the diagonal of the square, is \(6\sqrt{2}\).
- Using the relationship between the side length and diagonal of a square, \(s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\), we found the side length \(s = 6\).
- The correct answer choice is C. 6.
