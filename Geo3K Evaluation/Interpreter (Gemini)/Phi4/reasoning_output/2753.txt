**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have a circle with points \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(I\) lying on it.
- Lines \(ID\) and \(BC\) intersect at point \(E\).
- The lengths of segments \(DE\), \(IE\), \(BE\), and \(EC\) are given, with \(EC = x\).
- The equation \(DE \times IE = BE \times EC\) is provided, which is a form of the Power of a Point theorem.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

- We need to find the length of \(EC\) (denoted as \(x\)) using the given equation and constraints.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems**

- The equation \(DE \times IE = BE \times EC\) is derived from the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(E\) outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant line through \(E\) equals the product of the lengths of the segments of another secant line through \(E\).

**Step 4: Substitute known values into the equation**

- Given:
  - \(DE = 8.1\)
  - \(IE = 10.3\)
  - \(BE = 17\)
  - \(EC = x\)

- Substitute these into the equation:
  \[
  8.1 \times 10.3 = 17 \times x
  \]

**Step 5: Solve for \(x\)**

- Calculate \(8.1 \times 10.3\):
  \[
  8.1 \times 10.3 = 83.43
  \]

- Set up the equation:
  \[
  83.43 = 17 \times x
  \]

- Solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{83.43}{17} \approx 4.906
  \]

**Step 6: Compare the calculated result with the given answer choices**

- The calculated value of \(x\) is approximately \(4.906\).
- The closest answer choice to \(4.906\) is \(5\).

**Step 7: Select the closest answer choice**

- The closest answer choice to \(4.906\) is \(5\).
