**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have two points, \(A\) and \(D\), on line \(AD\), and two points, \(B\) and \(C\), on line \(BC\).
- The lines \(AD\) and \(BC\) intersect at point \(C\).
- Angles \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair.
- The sum of the measures of \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) is 180 degrees, which is a property of a linear pair.
- We are given that \(m\angle 2 = 67^\circ\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair, their measures add up to 180 degrees.
- Therefore, we can write the equation: 
  \[
  m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substitute the given measure of \(\angle 2\) into the equation:
  \[
  m\angle 1 + 67^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \(m\angle 1\)**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \(m\angle 1\):
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ
  \]
- Calculate the result:
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 113^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(113^\circ\).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 67, B. 113, C. 123, D. 133.
- The correct choice is B. 113.

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**
- Reassess the calculations and logic to ensure no errors were made.
- The calculations are consistent with the properties of a linear pair.
- The closest and correct answer choice is B.

**Solution:**

Given that \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair, their measures sum to 180 degrees. With \(m\angle 2 = 67^\circ\), we calculated:

\[
m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ = 113^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(113^\circ\), which corresponds to answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
