1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle \( A \) with points \( D, B, \) and \( C \) lying on it.
   - The measure of arc \( DC \) is given as 218 degrees.
   - We know that the total measure of the circle is 360 degrees.

2. **Determine the Measure of Arc \( CD \):**
   - Since the sum of the measures of arcs \( DC \) and \( CD \) is 360 degrees, we can find the measure of arc \( CD \) using:
     \[
     \text{Measure of Arc } CD = 360 - \text{Measure of Arc } DC = 360 - 218 = 142 \text{ degrees}
     \]

3. **Understand the Relationship Between the Angle and Arc:**
   - The problem states that the measure of angle \( \angle DBC \) is half the measure of arc \( CD \). This is a property of inscribed angles in a circle, where an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

4. **Calculate the Measure of \( \angle DBC \):**
   - Using the property of inscribed angles:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle DBC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of Arc } CD = \frac{1}{2} \times 142 = 71 \text{ degrees}
     \]

5. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The question asks for the measure of \( m \angle 1 \), which is \( \angle DBC \).

6. **Compare the Calculated Result with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle DBC \) is 71 degrees.
   - The given answer choices are: A. 54.5, B. 90, C. 109, D. 218.
   - The closest value to 71 degrees is not directly listed, but we must choose the closest option.

7. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - Among the choices, 71 is closest to 54.5, but considering the nature of typical geometric problems and the choices provided, 71 is actually closer to 90 than to 54.5.

8. **Final Decision:**
   - Given the options and the typical rounding or approximation in such problems, the closest reasonable choice is B. 90.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and the properties of inscribed angles, the measure of \( \angle DBC \) is 71 degrees. Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest option is B. 90 degrees.

Final Answer: B
