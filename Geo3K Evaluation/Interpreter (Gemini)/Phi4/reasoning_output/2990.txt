**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have multiple points and lines defined in the problem.
   - The lines \( \text{Line(W,B)} \) and \( \text{Line(A,D)} \) are parallel.
   - We know the measures of angles 1 and 3: \( m \angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m \angle 3 = 60^\circ \).
   - Our task is to find the measure of \( \angle 8 \).

2. **Identify Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since \( \text{Line(W,B)} \parallel \text{Line(A,D)} \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.
   - Angles 1 and 3 are likely related through a transversal intersecting these parallel lines.

3. **Summarize Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

4. **Explore Possible Configurations:**
   - Assume that angles 1 and 3 are formed by a transversal intersecting the parallel lines \( \text{Line(W,B)} \) and \( \text{Line(A,D)} \).
   - If angle 1 is a corresponding angle to another angle on the parallel line, then angle 3 could be an alternate interior angle or a consecutive interior angle.

5. **Verify and Calculate:**
   - If angle 3 is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal as angle 1, then angles 1 and 3 are consecutive interior angles.
   - The sum of consecutive interior angles is \( 180^\circ \).

6. **Calculate \( \angle 8 \):**
   - If angle 3 is consecutive to angle 1, then:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     50^\circ + 60^\circ = 110^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining angle \( \angle 8 \) on the same side of the transversal must be:
     \[
     m \angle 8 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Consider if angle 8 could be an exterior angle or another type of angle.
   - If angle 8 is an exterior angle to the triangle formed by the transversal and one of the parallel lines, it would be equal to the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles.

8. **Recalculate \( \angle 8 \) as an Exterior Angle:**
   - If angle 8 is an exterior angle, then:
     \[
     m \angle 8 = m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 50^\circ + 60^\circ = 110^\circ
     \]

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle 8 \) as an exterior angle is \( 110^\circ \).
   - This matches answer choice B.

10. **Finalize:**
    - Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 8 \) is \( 110^\circ \).

**Solution Section:**

- Given the parallel lines and the transversal, angle 8 can be considered as an exterior angle to the triangle formed by the transversal and one of the parallel lines.
- Using the exterior angle theorem, \( m \angle 8 = m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 50^\circ + 60^\circ = 110^\circ \).
- Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 8 \) is \( 110^\circ \).
