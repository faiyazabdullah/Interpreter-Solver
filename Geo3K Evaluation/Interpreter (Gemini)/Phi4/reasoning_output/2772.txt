**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a circle \( C \) with points \( X \), \( Z \), and \( W \) lying on the circle.
- Lines \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are tangents to circle \( C \).
- The measure of angle \( \angle XYZ \) is given as 68 degrees.
- The arc \( XWZ \) measures 224 degrees.
- The sum of the measures of arcs \( XWZ \) and \( XZ \) is 360 degrees.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{XZ} \), denoted as \( m\widehat{XZ} \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are tangents to the circle, angle \( \angle XYZ \) is the external angle formed by these tangents.
- The measure of an external angle formed by two tangents is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
- The intercepted arcs are \( XWZ \) and \( XZ \).

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**

- Using the external angle theorem for tangents:
  \[
  \angle XYZ = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of Arc } XWZ - \text{Measure of Arc } XZ \right)
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  68 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 224 - m\widehat{XZ} \right)
  \]

**Step 5: Solve for \( m\widehat{XZ} \)**

- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  136 = 224 - m\widehat{XZ}
  \]
- Rearrange to solve for \( m\widehat{XZ} \):
  \[
  m\widehat{XZ} = 224 - 136 = 88
  \]

**Step 6: Verify the Calculation**

- Check the sum of the arcs:
  \[
  m\widehat{XWZ} + m\widehat{XZ} = 224 + 88 = 312
  \]
- The sum should be 360 degrees, so the remaining arc \( WZ \) must be:
  \[
  360 - 312 = 48
  \]
- This confirms the calculations are consistent with the given constraints.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( m\widehat{XZ} \) is 88, which matches option C.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**

- The correct answer is option C.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of arc \( \widehat{XZ} \) is 88 degrees. This matches option C.
