**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have lines \( l \parallel m \) and a transversal line \( n \) intersecting both \( l \) and \( m \).
- Points \( B \) and \( C \) are the intersections of \( n \) with \( l \) and \( m \), respectively.
- Points \( E \), \( B \), and \( A \) lie on line \( l \), while points \( F \), \( C \), and \( A \) lie on line \( m \).
- Points \( N \), \( G \), and other points lie on line \( n \).
- Several angles are given, with equal measures: \( \angle 1 = \angle 4 \), \( \angle 5 = \angle 1 \), \( \angle 7 = \angle 4 \), and \( \angle 7 = \angle 1 \).
- The sum of certain angles is given: \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 \), \( \angle 1 + \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 3 + \angle 5 \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find all angles that are supplementary to \( \angle 1 \). Two angles are supplementary if their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( l \parallel m \) and \( n \) is a transversal, we can use the properties of parallel lines:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

**Step 4: Determine Supplementary Angles to \( \angle 1 \)**

- **\( \angle 2 \):** Since \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 \) is given, \( \angle 2 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).
- **\( \angle 3 \):** Since \( \angle 1 + \angle 3 \) is given, \( \angle 3 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).
- **\( \angle 4 \):** \( \angle 1 = \angle 4 \), so \( \angle 4 \) is not supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) (they are equal).
- **\( \angle 5 \):** \( \angle 5 = \angle 1 \), so \( \angle 5 \) is not supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).
- **\( \angle 6 \):** Not directly related in given information, but if \( \angle 6 \) is consecutive to \( \angle 1 \) on line \( l \), it would be supplementary.
- **\( \angle 7 \):** \( \angle 7 = \angle 1 \), so \( \angle 7 \) is not supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).
- **\( \angle 8 \):** If \( \angle 8 \) is consecutive to \( \angle 4 \) on line \( n \), and since \( \angle 1 = \angle 4 \), \( \angle 8 \) would be supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Results with Answer Choices**

- From the analysis, angles supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) are \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), \( \angle 6 \), and \( \angle 8 \).

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer Choice**

- The closest match to our findings is choice A: angles 2, 3, 6, and 7. However, \( \angle 7 \) is equal to \( \angle 1 \), not supplementary. The correct supplementary angles are \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), \( \angle 6 \), and \( \angle 8 \). Choice A is the closest match, considering the constraints.
