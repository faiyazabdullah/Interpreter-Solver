**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given two angles, Angle(4) and Angle(5), with their measures expressed as algebraic expressions: 
  - Measure of Angle(4) = \(2y + 32\)
  - Measure of Angle(5) = \(3y - 3\)
- The lines Line(A, C) and Line(D, E) are parallel.
- Point H lies on both Line(A, C) and Line(F, G), and Point B lies on both Line(D, E) and Line(F, G).
- We know that the measure of Angle(4) equals the measure of Angle(5).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the value of \(y\) such that the measures of Angle(4) and Angle(5) are equal.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Theorems and Set Up Equations**
- Since Measure of Angle(4) equals Measure of Angle(5), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2y + 32 = 3y - 3
  \]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**
- Rearrange the equation to isolate \(y\):
  \[
  2y + 32 = 3y - 3
  \]
  Subtract \(2y\) from both sides:
  \[
  32 = y - 3
  \]
  Add 3 to both sides:
  \[
  35 = y
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- Substitute \(y = 35\) back into the expressions for the angles to ensure they are equal:
  - Measure of Angle(4) = \(2(35) + 32 = 70 + 32 = 102\)
  - Measure of Angle(5) = \(3(35) - 3 = 105 - 3 = 102\)
- Both measures are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(y\) is 35, which matches answer choice B.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**
- Since our calculated value directly matches one of the answer choices, we select B.

**Solution**

Based on the systematic analysis and calculations, the value of \(y\) that satisfies the given geometric constraints is 35. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
