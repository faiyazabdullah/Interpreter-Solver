**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two rectangles: Rectangle(1) (blue) and Rectangle(A, B, C, D) (green).
- The area of Rectangle(1) is given as 8.
- The area of Rectangle(A, B, C, D) is given as 32.
- Rectangle(1) and Rectangle(A, B, C, D) are similar figures.
- We need to find the scale factor from the blue figure (Rectangle(1)) to the green figure (Rectangle(A, B, C, D)).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Similar figures have corresponding side lengths that are proportional, and their areas are proportional to the square of the scale factor.
- If the scale factor from Rectangle(1) to Rectangle(A, B, C, D) is \( k \), then the area of Rectangle(A, B, C, D) is \( k^2 \) times the area of Rectangle(1).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- We know the area of Rectangle(1) is 8 and the area of Rectangle(A, B, C, D) is 32.
- Using the relationship between the areas of similar figures: 
  \[
  \text{Area of Rectangle(A, B, C, D)} = k^2 \times \text{Area of Rectangle(1)}
  \]
  \[
  32 = k^2 \times 8
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for the Scale Factor**

- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( k^2 \):
  \[
  k^2 = \frac{32}{8} = 4
  \]
- Solve for \( k \):
  \[
  k = \sqrt{4} = 2
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated scale factor \( k \) is 2, which corresponds to the answer choice \( \frac{2}{1} \).

**Step 6: Verify and Reflect**

- Reassess the calculations: \( k^2 = 4 \) leads to \( k = 2 \), which is consistent with the properties of similar figures.
- The closest answer choice to \( k = 2 \) is \( \frac{2}{1} \).

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is \( \frac{2}{1} \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given that the areas of similar figures are proportional to the square of the scale factor, we set up the equation:

\[
32 = k^2 \times 8
\]

Solving for \( k^2 \):

\[
k^2 = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
k = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

Thus, the scale factor from the blue figure to the green figure is \( \frac{2}{1} \).
