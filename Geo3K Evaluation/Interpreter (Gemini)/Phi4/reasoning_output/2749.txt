1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a rectangle \(WXYZ\) with points \(W, X, Y, Z\) forming its vertices.
   - Points \(P\) is the intersection of diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\), and it is also the midpoint of both diagonals.
   - We have expressions for \(ZP\) and \(PY\):
     \[
     ZP = 4x - 9
     \]
     \[
     PY = 2x + 5
     \]
   - The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, so \(WY = XZ\).
   - Point \(P\) is the midpoint of both diagonals, implying \(ZP = PX\) and \(WP = PY\).
   - We have the equation:
     \[
     ZP = PY
     \]
     Substituting the given expressions:
     \[
     4x - 9 = 2x + 5
     \]

2. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     4x - 2x = 5 + 9
     \]
     \[
     2x = 14
     \]
     \[
     x = 7
     \]

3. **Finding Lengths:**
   - Substitute \(x = 7\) back into the expressions for \(ZP\) and \(PY\):
     \[
     ZP = 4(7) - 9 = 28 - 9 = 19
     \]
     \[
     PY = 2(7) + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
     \]
   - Since \(ZP = PX\) and \(PY = WP\), and both equal 19, the full diagonal \(XZ = 2 \times ZP = 2 \times 19 = 38\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of diagonal \(XZ\) is 38.
   - Compare this with the answer choices: A. 9, B. 10, C. 19, D. 38.
   - The correct choice is D. 38.

</think>
**Solution:**
- We calculated the value of \(x\) by solving \(4x - 9 = 2x + 5\), yielding \(x = 7\).
- Substituting \(x = 7\) into the expressions for \(ZP\) and \(PY\), we found both to be 19.
- Since \(P\) is the midpoint of diagonal \(XZ\), the full length of \(XZ\) is \(2 \times 19 = 38\).
- Therefore, the length of \(XZ\) is 38, matching answer choice D.

Final Answer: D.
