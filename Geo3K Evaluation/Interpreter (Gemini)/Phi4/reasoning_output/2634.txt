**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**

- We are given a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with points \( X, Y, Z \) as midpoints of the sides \( RS, RT, ST \) respectively.
- \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of \( \triangle RST \).
- The length of \( XY \) is given as 7.
- The length of \( RT \) is 13.
- \( XZ \) is parallel to \( RT \), and \( XY \) is parallel to \( ST \).
- \( XZ = \frac{1}{2} \times RT \).
- \( XY = \frac{1}{2} \times ST \).

**Step 2: Apply the Midsegment Theorem**

The midsegment theorem states that a segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long.

- Since \( XZ \) is a midsegment and parallel to \( RT \), we have:
  \[
  XZ = \frac{1}{2} \times RT = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 = 6.5
  \]

- Since \( XY \) is a midsegment and parallel to \( ST \), we have:
  \[
  XY = \frac{1}{2} \times ST
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate \( ST \) Using the Given Length of \( XY \)**

- We know \( XY = 7 \), so:
  \[
  7 = \frac{1}{2} \times ST
  \]

- Solving for \( ST \):
  \[
  ST = 2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

**Step 4: Verify Calculations and Consistency**

- Check the consistency with the midsegment properties:
  - \( XZ = 6.5 \) is indeed half of \( RT = 13 \).
  - \( XY = 7 \) is indeed half of \( ST = 14 \).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of \( ST \) is 14.
- Among the answer choices, 14 corresponds to option C.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The solution is consistent with all given constraints and calculations.
- The correct answer choice is C.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and applying the midsegment theorem, we calculated that the length of \( ST \) is 14. This matches option C.
