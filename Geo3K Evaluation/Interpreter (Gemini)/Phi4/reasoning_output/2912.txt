**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are provided with several points and lines, along with specific geometric relationships. Key relationships include parallel lines, congruent angles, and intersections.
- We know that \(\angle 12\) measures 64 degrees, and the sum of the measures of \(\angle 12\) and \(\angle 11\) is 180 degrees.
- \(\angle 7\) is congruent to \(\angle 11\).
- The sum of the measures of \(\angle 7\) and \(\angle 12\) is 180 degrees.

**Step 2: Determine What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 7\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(\angle 12 + \angle 11 = 180\), we can solve for \(\angle 11\):
  \[
  \angle 11 = 180 - \angle 12 = 180 - 64 = 116
  \]
- Given \(\angle 7 \cong \angle 11\), \(\angle 7\) is also 116 degrees.

**Step 4: Verify Using Another Given Relationship**
- We know \(\angle 7 + \angle 12 = 180\). Substituting the known value of \(\angle 12\):
  \[
  \angle 7 + 64 = 180
  \]
  \[
  \angle 7 = 180 - 64 = 116
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle 7\) is 116 degrees, which does not directly match any of the provided answer choices.
- We must choose the closest answer. The provided choices are:
  - A. 54
  - B. 64
  - C. 74
  - D. 84

- The closest value to 116 is D. 84.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**
- Reassess all calculations and logical steps to ensure no mistakes were made. The calculations align with the given constraints and theorems.
- The discrepancy between 116 and the closest choice (84) suggests a potential oversight in the problem setup or answer choices, but based on the instructions, we select the closest available choice.

**Final Conclusion**
- Based on the calculations and the requirement to choose the closest option, the measure of \(\angle 7\) is closest to 84 degrees.

Final Answer: D
</think>

**Solution**
Based on the given constraints and calculations:
- \(\angle 12 = 64\)
- \(\angle 12 + \angle 11 = 180\) implies \(\angle 11 = 116\)
- \(\angle 7 \cong \angle 11\) implies \(\angle 7 = 116\)
- \(\angle 7 + \angle 12 = 180\) confirms \(\angle 7 = 116\)

The closest answer choice to 116 is D. 84.

Final Answer: D
