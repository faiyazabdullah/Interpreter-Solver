### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- We have two triangles: Triangle \( \triangle ADE \) and Triangle \( \triangle BCE \).
- For \( \triangle ADE \), the angles are \( \angle DAE \), \( \angle ADE \), and \( \angle DEA \).
- For \( \triangle BCE \), the angles are \( \angle BCE \), \( \angle CEB \), and \( \angle EBC \).
- We are given:
  - \( \angle DAE = \angle 2 \).
  - \( \angle CEB = \angle 1 \).

### Step 2: Sum of Angles in Triangles
- For \( \triangle ADE \), the sum of the angles is \( \angle DAE + \angle ADE + \angle DEA = 180^\circ \).
- For \( \triangle BCE \), the sum of the angles is \( \angle BCE + \angle CEB + \angle EBC = 180^\circ \).

### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \), which is \( \angle DAE \).

### Step 4: Use Given Equalities
- We know \( \angle CEB = \angle 1 \).
- We need to find a relationship or additional information that can help us determine \( \angle 2 \).

### Step 5: Consider Additional Relationships
- Since \( \angle DAE = \angle 2 \) and \( \angle CEB = \angle 1 \), we need to explore if there are any geometric properties or additional constraints that can help us relate these angles.

### Step 6: Explore Possible Relationships
- Since no specific numerical values are given for other angles, we need to consider if there are any parallel lines, cyclic quadrilaterals, or other geometric properties that might apply.
- However, no such additional constraints are explicitly given.

### Step 7: Reassess and Reflect
- Given the lack of additional constraints, we need to consider if the problem might involve a typical geometric configuration where certain angles are equal or supplementary.
- Since \( \angle CEB = \angle 1 \) is given, and no other specific angles are provided, we might consider typical angle measures that often appear in geometric problems.

### Step 8: Make an Informed Guess
- Without loss of generality, and given typical angle measures in geometric problems, let's consider common angle measures that might fit.
- The problem asks for the closest match if an exact match isn't found.

### Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices
- The answer choices are 23, 24, 28, and 33.
- Since we have no additional information, we consider typical angle measures and choose the closest reasonable guess.

### Step 10: Final Decision
- Given the constraints and typical angle measures, let's assume \( \angle 2 \) is a common angle measure.
- The choice of 24 degrees is a reasonable assumption for a typical angle measure in such problems.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and typical angle measures in geometric problems, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is most reasonably assumed to be 24 degrees.
