1. **Analyze the given constraints:**
   - We have a circle with center at point W.
   - Points A, B, D, and E lie on the circle.
   - Point C is on line AB and is the midpoint of AB.
   - Point F is on line ED and is the midpoint of ED.
   - Line WC is perpendicular to line AB.
   - Line WF is perpendicular to line ED.
   - The length WC is equal to WF.
   - The length of line ED is 30.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to determine the length of DF.

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties:**
   - Since C and F are midpoints of AB and ED, respectively, AC = CB and EF = FD.
   - Given that ED = 30, and F is the midpoint, EF = FD = 30/2 = 15.
   - WC = WF implies that triangles WCF and WDF are congruent because they share side WF = WC, and both have right angles at C and F respectively (since WC ⊥ AB and WF ⊥ ED).

4. **Verify calculations and logic:**
   - Since EF = FD = 15, we have already determined half of ED.
   - The perpendicularity and equal lengths (WC = WF) imply symmetry in the configuration, confirming that triangles WCF and WDF are congruent.
   - Therefore, DF = 15.

5. **Compare the calculated result with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated length of DF is 15.
   - Among the answer choices, 15 is option A.

6. **Reassess and refine:**
   - Double-check the symmetry and congruence of triangles WCF and WDF.
   - Reconfirm that EF = FD = 15 given the midpoint condition.

7. **Select the closest answer:**
   - The calculated length of DF is exactly 15, which matches option A.

8. **Finalize the solution:**
   - Based on the analysis and calculations, the length of DF is 15.
   - The correct choice is A.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the calculations, the length of DF is determined to be 15. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
