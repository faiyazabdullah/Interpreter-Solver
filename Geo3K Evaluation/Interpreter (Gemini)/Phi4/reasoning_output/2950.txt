**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have several points: A, B, C, D, F, and J, which lie on the circle with D as the center.
- The lines DA, DB, DC, DF, and DJ are all radii of the circle, meaning DA = DB = DC = DF = DJ.
- Quadrilateral ABCD is formed by points A, B, C, and D.
- Points A, B, C lie on the circle, and D is the center of the circle.
- We need to determine the measure of angle ABC.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since D is the center, triangles ABD, BCD, and ADC are isosceles with equal sides (radii).
- The angles at D in triangles ABD, BCD, and ADC are central angles.
- The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- Since DA = DB = DC, triangle BDC is isosceles with BD = DC.
- Angle BDC is a central angle subtending arc BC.
- Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral (all vertices lie on the circle), opposite angles sum to 180 degrees.

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Angle ABC**

- Consider the central angle BDC. Since DA = DB = DC, triangle BDC is isosceles with BD = DC.
- The central angle BDC subtends arc BC.
- Since DA = DB = DC, angle BDC is 60 degrees because it is an equilateral triangle (all sides are radii of the circle).
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle ABC, which subtends the same arc BC, is half of angle BDC.
- Therefore, m∠ABC = 60° / 2 = 30°.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of angle ABC is 30 degrees.
- Among the answer choices, 30 degrees corresponds to option A.

**Step 6: Final Verification**

- Reassess the calculations and logic: The use of the Inscribed Angle Theorem and properties of isosceles triangles was correctly applied.
- The conclusion that m∠ABC = 30° is consistent with the given constraints and theorems.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of angle ABC is 30 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
