1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \(E\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on its circumference.
   - Tangents \(AB\) and \(BC\) are drawn to circle \(E\), implying that \(\angle ABE\) and \(\angle CBE\) are right angles.
   - We know \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).
   - Arcs \(\widehat{AC}\) and \(\widehat{ADC}\) are involved, with measures \(x\) and \(y\) respectively.
   - The sum of \(x\) and \(y\) is \(360^\circ\), and the difference \(y - x = 140^\circ\).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\), denoted as \(x\).

3. **Applying Relevant Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(AB\) and \(BC\) are tangents, \(\angle ABE = \angle CBE = 90^\circ\).
   - The angle between two tangents from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
   - Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}(y - x)\).

4. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - From the given, \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).
   - Thus, \(\frac{1}{2}(y - x) = 70\).
   - Solving gives \(y - x = 140\).

5. **Using Given Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \(x + y = 360\)
     2. \(y - x = 140\)

6. **Solving the System of Equations:**
   - Add the two equations:
     \[
     (x + y) + (y - x) = 360 + 140
     \]
     \[
     2y = 500 \implies y = 250
     \]
   - Substitute \(y = 250\) into \(x + y = 360\):
     \[
     x + 250 = 360 \implies x = 110
     \]

7. **Verification:**
   - Check the difference: \(y - x = 250 - 110 = 140\), which is correct.
   - Check the sum: \(x + y = 110 + 250 = 360\), which is also correct.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(x = 110\).

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(x = 110\). This matches choice C. Therefore, the correct answer is:
