1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle \( C \) with center \( L \).
   - Points \( G, H, J, \) and \( K \) lie on circle \( C \).
   - Line segments \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are chords of circle \( C \).
   - The chords \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are congruent.
   - Arcs \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are congruent, meaning they have equal measures.
   - The measure of arc \( KJ \) is given as \( 2x - 27 \).

2. **Identifying What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \).

3. **Using Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( GH \cong KJ \) and the arcs \( GH \cong KJ \), their measures are equal: 
     \[
     \text{Measure of Arc } GH = \text{Measure of Arc } KJ
     \]
   - Given that the measure of arc \( KJ \) is \( 2x - 27 \), the measure of arc \( GH \) is also \( 2x - 27 \).

4. **Applying the Congruence of Arcs:**
   - Since arcs \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are congruent, their measures are equal:
     \[
     \text{Measure of Arc } GH = \text{Measure of Arc } KJ = 2x - 27
     \]
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
     \[
     \text{Measure of Arc } GH = 2x - 27
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Since the arcs are congruent, their measures are equal, and we don't have additional information about the total measure of the circle or other arcs, we assume the simplest scenario where the arcs are equal and directly solve for \( x \) using the given equation:
     \[
     2x - 27 = 2x - 27
     \]
   - This equation is always true, but we need to find a specific value for \( x \) based on the context of the problem.
   - Since the arcs are congruent and we are given no additional constraints, we assume the arcs are a significant portion of the circle, such as a semicircle, which measures \( 180^\circ \).
   - Set the measure of the arc equal to \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     2x - 27 = 180
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 180 + 27
     \]
     \[
     2x = 207
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{207}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 103.5
     \]

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 103.5 \) does not match any of the given choices directly.
   - We need to select the closest value from the options: A. 27, B. 54, C. 55, D. 83.
   - The closest value to \( 103.5 \) is \( 83 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the calculations and the closest match to the given choices, the best choice is \( x = 83 \).

</think>

<Solution>
- The measure of arc \( KJ \) is given as \( 2x - 27 \).
- Since arcs \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are congruent, their measures are equal.
- Assuming the arcs are significant and possibly semicircular, set \( 2x - 27 = 180 \).
- Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 103.5 \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 103.5 \) is \( 83 \).
