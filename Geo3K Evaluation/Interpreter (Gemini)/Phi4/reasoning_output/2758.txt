1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**: We are given a trapezoid \( GHJK \) with \( GH \) and \( KJ \) as its parallel bases. The lengths of \( GH \) and \( KJ \) are 17 and 13, respectively. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square meters.

2. **Identifying the Objective**: We need to find the height of the trapezoid \( GHJK \).

3. **Applying the Trapezoid Area Formula**: The area \( A \) of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Here, \( \text{Base}_1 = 17 \), \( \text{Base}_2 = 13 \), and \( A = 75 \).

4. **Substituting the Known Values**: Plugging the known values into the area formula, we get:
   \[
   75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times \text{Height}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   75 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times \text{Height}
   \]
   \[
   75 = 15 \times \text{Height}
   \]

6. **Solving for Height**: To find the height, divide both sides by 15:
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{75}{15} = 5
   \]

7. **Verification**: Reassess the calculations to ensure no errors. The steps followed the trapezoid area formula correctly, and the arithmetic was verified.

8. **Comparison with Answer Choices**: The calculated height is 5. Among the answer choices, 5 is directly listed as option C.

9. **Conclusion**: The calculated height matches one of the given options directly, confirming the accuracy of the solution.

<Solution>
Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we derived the equation:
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times \text{Height}
\]
Simplifying, we found:
\[
75 = 15 \times \text{Height}
\]
Solving for height, we determined:
\[
\text{Height} = \frac{75}{15} = 5
\]
Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is 5 meters. Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is C.

Final Answer: C
</Solution>
