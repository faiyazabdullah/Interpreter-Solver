### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- **Points and Lines**: We have points W, X, Y, Z, D, T, and several lines connecting these points.
- **Perpendicular Lines**: Line(X, Z) is perpendicular to Line(D, T).
- **Midpoint**: Point Y is the midpoint of Line(X, Z), implying XZ is bisected by DT at Y.
- **Congruent Segments**: Line(X, Y) is congruent to Line(Y, Z).
- **Lengths**: Length of Line(W, Z) is 14.9, and Line(W, X) is equal in length to Line(W, Z).
- **Right Angle**: Angle(X, Y, W) is a right angle.

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the length of Line(W, X).

### Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties
- Since Y is the midpoint of XZ, and Line(X, Y) is congruent to Line(Y, Z), XZ is bisected equally by Y.
- Line(D, T) is the perpendicular bisector of Line(X, Z), confirming Y is equidistant from X and Z.
- Given that Angle(X, Y, W) is a right angle, triangle XYW is a right triangle.

### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem
- In right triangle XYW:
  - \( XY = YZ \) (since Y is the midpoint and XZ is bisected equally).
  - \( WZ = 14.9 \) and \( WX = WZ \) (given).
  - We need to find \( WX \).

### Step 5: Calculate Using Known Lengths
- Since \( WZ = 14.9 \) and \( WX = WZ \), \( WX = 14.9 \).

### Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated length of \( WX \) is 14.9.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 7.45
  - B. 14.9
  - C. 22.4
  - D. 25.3

The closest and exact match is 14.9, which corresponds to choice B.

### Step 7: Finalize the Answer
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is B.
