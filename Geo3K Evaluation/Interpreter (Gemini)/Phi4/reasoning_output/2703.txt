1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a triangle ABC with points A, B, and C.
   - Point D lies on line BC.
   - The lengths of the sides are given: AC = 10, AB = 14, and BC = 18.
   - We need to find the length BD = x.
   - CD = 18 - x due to D lying on BC.
   - Line AD bisects angle BAC.
   - The ratio of AC to AB is equal to the ratio of CD to BD.

2. **Identify the Required Calculation:**
   - We need to find the length BD (denoted as x).

3. **Apply Relevant Theorems:**
   - Since AD bisects angle BAC, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of the opposite sides (BD/CD) is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides (AB/AC).

4. **Set Up the Equation Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - According to the Angle Bisector Theorem:
     \[
     \frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \frac{x}{18-x} = \frac{14}{10}
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for x:
     \[
     10x = 14(18-x)
     \]
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     10x = 252 - 14x
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     10x + 14x = 252
     \]
     \[
     24x = 252
     \]
   - Solve for x:
     \[
     x = \frac{252}{24} = 10.5
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Check the calculations: 
     - \(10x = 14(18-x)\) simplifies to \(10x = 252 - 14x\).
     - \(24x = 252\) gives \(x = 10.5\).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of x is 10.5, which matches option A.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since 10.5 is exactly one of the choices, select A.

</think>

**Solution:**

To find the length BD (denoted as x), we used the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the ratio of the segments created by the bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. Setting up the equation \(\frac{x}{18-x} = \frac{14}{10}\), we solved for x to get \(x = 10.5\). This matches option A.

Final Answer: A
