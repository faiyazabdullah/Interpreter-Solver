### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints
- We have a circle with center \( Z \).
- There are points \( W, X, Y, Z \).
- There are lines \( WX \) and \( XY \).
- Both lines \( WX \) and \( XY \) are tangent to the circle at points \( X \) and \( Y \) respectively.
- The lengths of the tangents are given by:
  - \( \text{Length of } WX = 2x + 9 \)
  - \( \text{Length of } XY = 3x + 6 \)
- It is given that the lengths of \( WX \) and \( XY \) are equal.

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the value of \( x \) such that the lengths of \( WX \) and \( XY \) are equal.

### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties
- Since both \( WX \) and \( XY \) are tangents to the circle from points \( W \) and \( X \) respectively, and they are equal, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2x + 9 = 3x + 6
  \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equation
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 9 = 3x + 6
  \]
  \[
  9 - 6 = 3x - 2x
  \]
  \[
  3 = x
  \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the expressions for the lengths:
  - \( \text{Length of } WX = 2(3) + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 \)
  - \( \text{Length of } XY = 3(3) + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \)
- Both lengths are equal, confirming that \( x = 3 \) is correct.

### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is 3.
- Check the answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 6, D. 9.
- The correct choice is B. 3.

### Step 7: Finalize the Answer
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is \( x = 3 \).

**Solution:**

To find the value of \( x \), we set the lengths of the tangents equal to each other:

\[
2x + 9 = 3x + 6
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
9 - 6 = 3x - 2x
\]

\[
3 = x
\]

Substituting \( x = 3 \) back into the expressions confirms that both lengths are equal:

- \( \text{Length of } WX = 2(3) + 9 = 15 \)
- \( \text{Length of } XY = 3(3) + 6 = 15 \)

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 3, which corresponds to answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
