1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given that quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
   - The key properties of a rectangle include:
     - Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
     - All interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).
   - We are tasked with finding the measure of \(\angle 3\) given that \(m \angle 1 = 30\).

2. **Analyzing Given Information:**
   - \(\angle 1\) measures 30 degrees.
   - \(\angle 3\) is part of the configuration involving lines and points in the rectangle.
   - Lines \(WZ\) and \(XY\) are diagonals and are congruent.
   - The intersection of these diagonals at point A implies certain properties about angles formed.

3. **Properties of Rectangles and Diagonals:**
   - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length.
   - The intersection of diagonals in a rectangle divides each diagonal into two equal segments.
   - Angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals are equal.

4. **Exploration of Angles:**
   - Since diagonals bisect each other, \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are equal, and \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 4\) are equal.
   - The diagonals form four angles at point A: \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), and \(\angle 4\).
   - The sum of angles around point A is 360 degrees.

5. **Calculation:**
   - Given \(m \angle 1 = 30\), and since diagonals bisect each other, \(\angle 2 = 30\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 + \angle 4 = 360\).
   - Substituting the known values: \(30 + 30 + \angle 3 + \angle 3 = 360\).
   - Simplifying: \(60 + 2\angle 3 = 360\).
   - Solving for \(\angle 3\): \(2\angle 3 = 300\).
   - \(\angle 3 = 150\).

6. **Reassessment:**
   - Since \(\angle 3\) is part of the intersection of diagonals, it should be considered as part of the angles formed by the diagonals.
   - The diagonals of a rectangle form two pairs of vertical angles, each pair summing to 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 1\) are supplementary: \(\angle 3 + \angle 1 = 180\).
   - Substituting \(m \angle 1 = 30\): \(\angle 3 + 30 = 180\).
   - Solving for \(\angle 3\): \(\angle 3 = 150\).

7. **Reflection and Correction:**
   - The calculation above was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the angle relationships.
   - Correct understanding: \(\angle 3\) is one of the angles formed by the diagonals, and since \(\angle 1 = 30\), \(\angle 3\) should be the complementary angle to \(\angle 1\) in the right triangle formed by the diagonal.
   - Therefore, \(\angle 3 = 90 - 30 = 60\).

8. **Verification:**
   - The diagonals of a rectangle form right triangles with the sides of the rectangle.
   - Given \(m \angle 1 = 30\), \(\angle 3\) is the complementary angle in the right triangle formed by the diagonal.
   - Thus, \(\angle 3 = 60\).

</think>

**Solution:**
Based on the properties of rectangles and the relationships between the angles formed by the diagonals, we determined that \(\angle 3\) is complementary to \(\angle 1\) in the right triangle formed by the diagonal. Therefore, \(\angle 3 = 60\) degrees.

Final Answer: C. 60
