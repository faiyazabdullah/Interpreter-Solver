**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have several lines and points with specific constraints:
  - Lines \( AG \) and \( ED \) are parallel.
  - Lines \( AG \) and \( BF \) intersect at point \( C \).
  - Lines \( ED \) and \( BF \) intersect at point \( H \).
  
- Angles are defined at these intersections:
  - Angle 3 is formed at the intersection of lines \( AG \) and \( BF \).
  - Angle 6 is formed at the intersection of lines \( ED \) and \( BF \).

- Given measurements:
  - \( m \angle 3 = x - 12 \)
  - \( m \angle 6 = 72 \)
  - \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 6 \)

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 6 \) and we know \( m \angle 6 = 72 \), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  x - 12 = 72
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x - 12 = 72
  \]
  \[
  x = 72 + 12
  \]
  \[
  x = 84
  \]

**Step 4: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( x \) is 84.
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 6, B. 18, C. 72, D. 84.
- The closest and exact match is option D.

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

- Reassess the steps to ensure no mistakes were made in the calculations.
- The setup and solving of the equation were straightforward and align with the given conditions.

**Step 6: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option D.

<Solution>

Given the constraints and calculations:

1. We established that \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 6 \).
2. Substituted the known value \( m \angle 6 = 72 \) into the equation \( x - 12 = 72 \).
3. Solved for \( x \) to find \( x = 84 \).
4. Verified that 84 matches one of the provided answer choices.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
