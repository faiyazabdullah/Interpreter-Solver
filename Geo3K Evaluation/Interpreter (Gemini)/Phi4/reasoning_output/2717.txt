1. **Analyzing the given constraints**:
   - We have several points and lines, with specific parallel lines and angles provided.
   - The given lines are \( \text{Line}(K,C) \) and \( \text{Line}(G,I) \) which are parallel.
   - The measure of \( \angle 3 \) is given as 43 degrees.
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 11 \).

2. **Understanding the geometric relationships**:
   - Since \( \text{Line}(K,C) \parallel \text{Line}(G,I) \), and these lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles properties apply.
   - \( \angle 3 \) is one of these angles formed by the transversal crossing the parallel lines.

3. **Identifying the relationship between \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \)**:
   - To determine the relationship, we need to know how \( \angle 11 \) is positioned relative to the parallel lines and the transversal.
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles, then they are equal.
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are alternate interior angles, then they are also equal.
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are consecutive interior angles, then they are supplementary, i.e., their measures add up to 180 degrees.

4. **Exploring the possible relationships**:
   - Without loss of generality, assume \( \angle 3 \) is an exterior angle formed by the transversal intersecting the parallel lines.
   - If \( \angle 11 \) is an alternate interior angle to \( \angle 3 \), then \( \angle 11 = \angle 3 = 43 \) degrees.
   - If \( \angle 11 \) is a consecutive interior angle to \( \angle 3 \), then \( \angle 11 + \angle 3 = 180 \) degrees, leading to \( \angle 11 = 180 - 43 = 137 \) degrees.

5. **Reassessing and refining**:
   - Given the parallel lines and the transversal, the most straightforward relationship without additional information would be alternate interior angles.
   - However, the problem does not explicitly state the position of \( \angle 11 \), so we must consider both possibilities.

6. **Verification and reflection**:
   - The problem does not provide additional details to definitively conclude the exact position of \( \angle 11 \).
   - The closest match to the calculated possibilities (43 or 137 degrees) among the answer choices is 137 degrees.

7. **Final decision**:
   - Given the lack of explicit positioning, and the need to choose the closest match, the measure of \( \angle 11 \) is likely 137 degrees if it is a consecutive interior angle.
</think>

<Solution>
- Given the parallel lines and transversal, \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) could be alternate interior angles or consecutive interior angles.
- If alternate interior, \( \angle 11 = 43 \) degrees.
- If consecutive interior, \( \angle 11 = 180 - 43 = 137 \) degrees.
- The closest match to the calculated possibilities among the answer choices is 137 degrees.
