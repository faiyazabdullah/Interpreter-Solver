1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given several points and lines with specific intersections and angles.
   - The line \( G \) intersects lines \( B, C \) and \( C, D \) at point \( C \).
   - The line \( G \) also intersects lines \( F, A \) and \( A, E \) at point \( A \).
   - The measure of angle 4 is given as 101 degrees.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle 6.

3. **Explore Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since \( G \) intersects lines \( B, C \) and \( C, D \) at point \( C \), angles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are formed at this intersection.
   - Similarly, \( G \) intersects lines \( F, A \) and \( A, E \) at point \( A \), forming angles 5, 6, 7, and 8 at this intersection.
   - We know \( \text{Measure of } \angle 4 = 101^\circ \).

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - At point \( C \), the angles formed by the intersection of lines are supplementary. This means:
     \[
     \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle 3 + \angle 4 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Given \( \angle 4 = 101^\circ \), we can find \( \angle 3 \):
     \[
     \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 101^\circ = 79^\circ
     \]

5. **Reflect on the Intersection at Point A:**
   - Similarly, at point \( A \), the angles formed are supplementary:
     \[
     \angle 5 + \angle 6 = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle 7 + \angle 8 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - We need to find \( \angle 6 \). To do this, we need more information about angles 5, 7, or 8.

6. **Assume Parallel Lines or Vertical Angles:**
   - If lines \( B, C \) and \( F, A \) are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal.
   - If \( \angle 3 = 79^\circ \) at point \( C \), and assuming \( \angle 5 \) is corresponding to \( \angle 3 \) (if lines are parallel), then \( \angle 5 = 79^\circ \).

7. **Calculate \( \angle 6 \):**
   - Using the supplementary relationship at point \( A \):
     \[
     \angle 5 + \angle 6 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     79^\circ + \angle 6 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 79^\circ = 101^\circ
     \]

8. **Verify and Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle 6 \) is \( 101^\circ \).
   - Among the answer choices, \( 101^\circ \) corresponds to option D.

9. **Conclude:**
   - Based on the calculations and assumptions, the measure of \( \angle 6 \) is \( 101^\circ \).
</think>

**Solution:**

1. Given that \( \angle 4 = 101^\circ \), and using the supplementary angle property at point \( C \), we found \( \angle 3 = 79^\circ \).
2. Assuming parallel lines or corresponding angles, \( \angle 5 = 79^\circ \).
3. Using the supplementary angle property at point \( A \), we calculated \( \angle 6 = 101^\circ \).
4. The calculated measure of \( \angle 6 \) matches option D.
