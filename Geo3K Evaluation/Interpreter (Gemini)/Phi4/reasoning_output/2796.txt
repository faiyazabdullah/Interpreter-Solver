1. **Analyze the given information:**
   - We have a circle \(B\) with points \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) on the circle.
   - \(W\) is a point outside the circle such that \(WX\) and \(WY\) are tangents to the circle at \(X\) and \(Y\) respectively.
   - The measure of \(\angle XWY\) is 49 degrees.
   - The measure of arc \(XY\) is 96 degrees.
   - We need to find the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\).

2. **Understand the relationship between angles and arcs:**
   - The angle formed by two tangents from a common external point (like \(\angle XWY\)) is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   - Therefore, \(\angle XWY = \frac{1}{2}(\text{Arc } YX - \text{Arc } XY)\).

3. **Apply the tangent-segment theorem:**
   - Given \(\angle XWY = 49^\circ\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     49 = \frac{1}{2}(\text{Arc } YX - 96)
     \]
   - Solving for \(\text{Arc } YX\):
     \[
     98 = \text{Arc } YX - 96
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc } YX = 194
     \]

4. **Determine the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\):**
   - \(\widehat{YXZ}\) is the inscribed angle that intercepts arc \(YZ\).
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - Arc \(YZ\) can be found as:
     \[
     \text{Arc } YZ = 360 - \text{Arc } XY - \text{Arc } YX = 360 - 96 - 194 = 70
     \]
   - Therefore, the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\) is:
     \[
     \widehat{YXZ} = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
     \]

5. **Reassess the problem:**
   - The question asks for the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\) in terms of the arc \(YXZ\), which is the entire arc from \(Y\) to \(Z\) passing through \(X\).
   - Arc \(YXZ\) is the sum of arcs \(YX\) and \(XZ\).
   - Arc \(XZ\) can be found as:
     \[
     \text{Arc } XZ = 360 - \text{Arc } YX = 360 - 194 = 166
     \]
   - Therefore, arc \(YXZ = \text{Arc } YX + \text{Arc } XZ = 194 + 66 = 260\).

6. **Verify calculations:**
   - The measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\) as an inscribed angle intercepting arc \(YZ\) was calculated as 35, but the question asks for the arc measure \(YXZ\).
   - The arc \(YXZ\) is indeed 194 + 66 = 260, but since the question asks for the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\) in terms of arc, we need to consider the arc \(YXZ\) directly.

7. **Final calculation:**
   - The measure of arc \(YXZ\) is 194 + 66 = 260.
   - The closest answer choice to 260 is 194, which corresponds to the arc \(YX\).

</think>
<Solution>
- The measure of arc \(YXZ\) is calculated as 194 + 66 = 260.
- The closest answer choice to the arc \(YXZ\) is 194, which corresponds to the arc \(YX\).
- Therefore, the measure of \(\widehat{YXZ}\) in terms of the arc is 194.
