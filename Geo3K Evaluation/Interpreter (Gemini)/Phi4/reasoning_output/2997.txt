### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \( B \) and points \( F, G, H, J \) all lying on this circle.
   - Lines \( FG \) and \( HJ \) are chords of the circle.
   - Lines \( HB \) and \( JB \) are radii of the circle, making \( \triangle HB \) and \( \triangle JB \) isosceles.
   - The lengths \( HB \) and \( JB \) are equal, confirming the isosceles nature of \( \triangle HBJ \).
   - The measure of \( \angle HBJ \) is given as \( 140^\circ \).
   - Arcs \( HJ \) and \( FG \) are congruent, implying \( \angle HBG = \angle FBH \) due to the congruence of the arcs they subtend.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( x \), which is the measure of \( \angle FBG \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( \angle HBJ = 140^\circ \) and \( \triangle HBJ \) is isosceles, the base angles \( \angle BHJ \) and \( \angle BJH \) are equal.
   - The sum of angles in \( \triangle HBJ \) is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
     \[
     \angle BHJ + \angle BJH + \angle HBJ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2\angle BHJ + 140^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2\angle BHJ = 40^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle BHJ = 20^\circ
     \]

4. **Determine \( \angle FBG \):**
   - Since arcs \( HJ \) and \( FG \) are congruent, the angles subtended by these arcs at the center are equal.
   - The central angle \( \angle HBG \) is twice the inscribed angle \( \angle HFG \) (or \( \angle HJG \)) due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
   - Since \( \angle HBJ = 140^\circ \), the arc \( HJ \) subtends \( 140^\circ \) at the center.
   - Therefore, arc \( FG \) also subtends \( 140^\circ \) at the center.
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle FBG \) is half of the central angle \( \angle FBG \) (or \( \angle HBG \)):
     \[
     \angle FBG = \frac{140^\circ}{2} = 70^\circ
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle FBG \) is \( 70^\circ \), which matches choice C.

6. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - All calculations and logical deductions align with the given constraints and geometric properties.
   - The closest and correct choice is \( 70^\circ \).

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle FBG \) is \( 70^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
