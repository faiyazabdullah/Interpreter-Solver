1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Circle A has points D, F, P, G on its circumference.
   - Lines DF and PG are diameters of circle A.
   - The length of diameter DF is given as 10.
   - Point A is the center of the circle.
   - DF is a diameter, so line DF passes through the center A.
   - The length of the radius is half the diameter.
   - DF is a straight line passing through A, making A the midpoint of DF.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of DA, where A is the center of the circle and D is a point on the circumference.
   - Since DF is a diameter and A is the midpoint, DA is the radius of the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - The diameter of a circle is twice the length of the radius.
   - Given that DF is a diameter of length 10, the radius (DA) is half of the diameter.

4. **Perform Calculations:**
   - Radius DA = Length of DF / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.

5. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - The calculation is straightforward as it follows directly from the property that the radius is half the diameter.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of DA is 5.
   - The available answer choices are A. 5, B. 10, C. 20, D. 25.
   - The calculated answer (5) matches choice A.

7. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - Since 5 is directly available as choice A, we select A.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - The closest and exact match to our calculated result is 5, which corresponds to choice A.

</think>

**Solution:**
- Given that DF is a diameter of circle A with length 10, the radius DA is half of the diameter.
- Thus, DA = 10 / 2 = 5.
- The correct answer choice that matches this calculation is A. 5.
