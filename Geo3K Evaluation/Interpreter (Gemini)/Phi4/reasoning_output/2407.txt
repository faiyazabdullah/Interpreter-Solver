1. **Analyze the given constraints and understand what is provided:**
   - We have a pentagon \( B, C, H, G, D \) and angles \( \angle FBC, \angle ICH, \angle AHG, \angle EGD, \angle JDB \).
   - The measures of these angles are given in terms of \( x \):
     - \( \angle FBC = x + 4 \)
     - \( \angle ICH = x \)
     - \( \angle AHG = x - 6 \)
     - \( \angle EGD = x + 10 \)
     - \( \angle JDB = 56 \)

2. **Identify the problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \).

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems or properties:**
   - The sum of interior angles in a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The given equation is the sum of the provided angles: 
     \[
     (x + 4) + x + (x - 6) + (x + 10) + 56 = 360
     \]
   - Note that this equation seems to consider the sum of exterior angles, which should be \( 360^\circ \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     (x + 4) + x + (x - 6) + (x + 10) + 56 = 360
     \]
     \[
     4x + 4 - 6 + 10 + 56 = 360
     \]
     \[
     4x + 64 = 360
     \]

5. **Isolate \( x \):**
   - Subtract 64 from both sides:
     \[
     4x = 296
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = 74
     \]

6. **Compare calculated result with answer choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 74.
   - The answer choices are A. 56, B. 68, C. 74, D. 84.
   - The closest match to our calculated result is C. 74.

7. **Verify all steps for accuracy:**
   - Re-checking the equation setup and simplification confirms the calculations are correct.

8. **Reflect and conclude:**
   - The solution is consistent with the problem constraints and calculations. The value of \( x \) is indeed 74.

</think>
**Solution:**

The value of \( x \) is found by solving the equation \( 4x + 64 = 360 \), which simplifies to \( 4x = 296 \), and further to \( x = 74 \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.
