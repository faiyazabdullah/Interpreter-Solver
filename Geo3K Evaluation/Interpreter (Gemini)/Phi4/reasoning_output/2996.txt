**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a parallelogram \(PQRS\) with the following properties:
  - \( \angle PQR = 128^\circ \)
  - \( PQ = RS = 5 \) (since \(PQ\) and \(RS\) are congruent)
  - \( PS = QR = 3 \) (since \(PS\) and \(QR\) are congruent)
  - \( PQ \parallel RS \) and \( QR \parallel PS \)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the length of \(QP\), which is the same as \(PQ\) due to the properties of a parallelogram.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore:
  - \(PQ = RS = 5\)
  - \(PS = QR = 3\)

**Step 4: Calculate the Required Length**
- Since \(QP\) is the same as \(PQ\) (due to the property of opposite sides in a parallelogram being equal), we have:
  - \(QP = PQ = 5\)

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**
- The calculated length of \(QP\) is 5.
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 3
  - B. 5
  - C. 8
  - D. 15
- The calculated result matches choice B.

**Step 6: Verify the Solution**
- Reassess the properties and calculations:
  - \(PQ = RS = 5\) is consistent with the given information.
  - \(PS = QR = 3\) is consistent with the given information.
  - All properties of the parallelogram are satisfied.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct answer is B.

**Solution:**

The length of \(QP\) is equal to the length of \(PQ\), which is 5. Therefore, the correct answer choice is B.

Final Answer: B
