### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Understanding the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a quadrilateral ABCD.
   - Lines AB and DC are parallel (\(AB \parallel DC\)).
   - We are given the measure of \(\angle D = 65^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle A = x\).
   - It is given that \(\angle A + \angle D = 180^\circ\).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle A\), denoted as \(x\).

3. **Applying Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \(AB \parallel DC\), \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) are consecutive interior angles on the same side of the transversal AD.
   - The sum of consecutive interior angles on the same side of a transversal with two parallel lines is \(180^\circ\).

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - From the given information: \(\angle A + \angle D = 180^\circ\).
   - Substitute the known value: \(x + 65^\circ = 180^\circ\).

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Check if the calculation is correct: \(180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ\).
   - This satisfies the condition that the sum of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) is \(180^\circ\).

7. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(115^\circ\).
   - Compare with the given answer choices: A. 32.5, B. 65, C. 105, D. 115.
   - The correct choice is D. 115.

8. **Reflection and Final Decision:**
   - The steps and calculations align with the geometric properties and given conditions.
   - The closest and exact match to the calculated value is option D.

### Solution:
By applying the properties of parallel lines and transversals, we determined that the sum of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) is \(180^\circ\). Solving the equation \(x + 65^\circ = 180^\circ\) gives \(x = 115^\circ\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
