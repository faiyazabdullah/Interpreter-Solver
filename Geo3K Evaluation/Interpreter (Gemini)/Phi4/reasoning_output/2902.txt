### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- **Points and Lines**: We have points J, K, L, and N. The lines involved are JK, JL, KL, and JN.
- **Midpoint**: N is the midpoint of line KL.
- **Perpendicular**: Line JN is perpendicular to line KL.
- **Lengths**: 
  - Length of JK is given by \(6x + 7\).
  - Length of JL is given by \(9x - 5\).
- **Congruent Segments**: KN is congruent to NL, meaning KN = NL.
- **Congruent Lines**: JK is congruent to JL, meaning \(6x + 7 = 9x - 5\).
- **Right Angle**: There is a right angle at angle JNL.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**

From the congruence of JK and JL:
\[ 6x + 7 = 9x - 5 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ 7 + 5 = 9x - 6x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Length of JK**

Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression for JK:
\[ \text{Length of JK} = 6x + 7 = 6(4) + 7 = 24 + 7 = 31 \]

**Step 4: Verify Conditions**

- **Midpoint and Perpendicularity**: Since N is the midpoint of KL and JN is perpendicular to KL, triangle JNL is a right triangle with JN as the height.
- **Congruent Segments**: KN = NL, which is consistent with N being the midpoint.
- **Right Angle**: The right angle at JNL is consistent with JN being perpendicular to KL.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length of JK is 31, which matches option B.

**Step 6: Final Verification**

Reassess the calculations and constraints:
- The equation \(6x + 7 = 9x - 5\) was solved correctly.
- The substitution and calculation for JK were accurate.
- All geometric constraints align with the calculated values.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of JK is 31. This matches option B.

Final Answer: B
