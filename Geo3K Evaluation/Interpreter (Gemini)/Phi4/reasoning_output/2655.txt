1. **Understanding the Given Constraints:**
   - We are given a square ABCD with points A, B, C, and D.
   - AB, BC, CD, and DA are the sides of the square and are congruent.
   - AC is a diagonal of the square.
   - Angle BCD is a right angle.
   - The length of diagonal AC is 13 units.
   - We need to find the measure of angle ABC, denoted as y.

2. **Analyzing the Geometry:**
   - Since ABCD is a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles (90 degrees).
   - The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees.
   - Diagonal AC divides the square into two congruent right triangles, ΔABC and ΔCDA.

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In right triangle ΔABC, AC is the hypotenuse.
   - Let the side length of the square be s. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = s^2 + s^2 = 2s^2
     \]
   - We know AC = 13, so:
     \[
     13^2 = 2s^2 \implies 169 = 2s^2 \implies s^2 = \frac{169}{2} \implies s = \sqrt{\frac{169}{2}}
     \]

4. **Finding the Measure of Angle ABC:**
   - In right triangle ΔABC, angle ABC is one of the non-right angles.
   - Since ABCD is a square, angle ABC is 45 degrees because the diagonals of a square bisect the angles.
   - Therefore, angle ABC is 45 degrees.

5. **Verification:**
   - The calculation of the side length s is consistent with the properties of a square and the given diagonal length.
   - The measure of angle ABC being 45 degrees is consistent with the properties of a square and its diagonals.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of angle ABC, y, is 45 degrees.
