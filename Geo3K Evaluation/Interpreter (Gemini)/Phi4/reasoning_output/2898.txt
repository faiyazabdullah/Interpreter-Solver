**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a rectangle \(D, F, C, E\) with a height of 3 units and a width of 8 units.
- There are two circles, \(A\) and \(B\), each with a radius of 1.5 units.
- The diameter of each circle is equal to the height of the rectangle, which is consistent as \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\).
- The circles \(A\) and \(B\) are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape.
- We need to find the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of one of the circles (since they are congruent, it doesn't matter which one we choose).

**Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle**

- The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of Rectangle} = \text{Height} \times \text{Width} = 3 \times 8 = 24
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Area of One Circle**

- The area of a circle is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of Circle} = \pi \times (\text{Radius})^2 = 3.1415926535 \times (1.5)^2
  \]
- Calculate \(1.5^2\):
  \[
  1.5^2 = 2.25
  \]
- Calculate the area:
  \[
  \text{Area of Circle} = 3.1415926535 \times 2.25 \approx 7.06858347075
  \]

**Step 4: Sum the Areas**

- Add the area of the rectangle and the area of one circle:
  \[
  \text{Total Area} = 24 + 7.06858347075 \approx 31.06858347075
  \]

**Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth**

- Round 31.06858347075 to the nearest tenth:
  \[
  31.1
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated total area rounded to the nearest tenth is 31.1.
- Among the given answer choices, 31.1 matches option B.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the calculations and rounding, the closest answer choice is B.

**Solution:**

1. Calculate the area of the rectangle:
   \[
   \text{Area of Rectangle} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

2. Calculate the area of one circle:
   \[
   \text{Area of Circle} = 3.1415926535 \times (1.5)^2 = 3.1415926535 \times 2.25 \approx 7.06858347075
   \]

3. Sum the areas:
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = 24 + 7.06858347075 \approx 31.06858347075
   \]

4. Round to the nearest tenth:
   \[
   31.1
   \]

5. Compare with answer choices and select the closest one.

Final Answer: B
