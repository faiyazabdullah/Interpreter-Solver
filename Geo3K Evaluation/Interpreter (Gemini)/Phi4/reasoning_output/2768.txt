**Analysis of Given Constraints:**

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Points and lines are provided, but we focus on the lines and angles.
   - Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D).
   - Measure of Angle(1) is 50 degrees.
   - Measure of Angle(3) is 60 degrees.
   - Points F, Q, G, N lie on lines B,W and A,D respectively.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of Angle(4).

3. **Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Parallel lines cut by a transversal create corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles that have specific relationships.
   - Sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.
   - Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

4. **Explore Relationships:**
   - Since Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D), and considering the transversal Line(F,C), we can use the properties of parallel lines.
   - Angle(1) and Angle(3) are given, and we need to find Angle(4).

5. **Consider Possible Configurations:**
   - If Angle(1) is 50 degrees and Angle(3) is 60 degrees, and these angles are related through parallel lines and a transversal, we can use the properties of alternate interior angles or corresponding angles.

6. **Calculate Using Properties:**
   - If Angle(1) is 50 degrees and is an alternate interior angle to Angle(4) (since Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D)), then Angle(4) should also be 50 degrees.
   - Alternatively, if Angle(1) and Angle(3) are consecutive interior angles, their sum should be 180 degrees. However, this doesn't directly help with Angle(4).

7. **Verification:**
   - Check if Angle(4) being 50 degrees fits all given conditions and relationships.
   - Ensure no contradictions with parallel line properties.

8. **Refinement and Conclusion:**
   - Given the parallel line setup and the transversal, Angle(4) being equal to Angle(1) is consistent with the alternate interior angle theorem.

</think>

<Solution>
1. **Identify Relationships:**
   - Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D).
   - Angle(1) = 50 degrees.
   - Angle(3) = 60 degrees.
   - We need to find Angle(4).

2. **Use Parallel Line Properties:**
   - Since Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D), and assuming Line(F,C) is a transversal, Angle(1) and Angle(4) are alternate interior angles.
   - Therefore, Angle(4) = Angle(1) = 50 degrees.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of Angle(4) is 50 degrees.

4. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - The closest answer choice is B. 50.
