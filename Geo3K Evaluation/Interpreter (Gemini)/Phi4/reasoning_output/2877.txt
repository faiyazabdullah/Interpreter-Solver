<think>
1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints**: 
   - We are given a regular hexagon \( A, C, D, E, F, G \) and a point \( H \).
   - The hexagon is regular, meaning all sides are equal, and all interior angles are equal.
   - The length of each side of the hexagon is 5 (e.g., \( \text{LengthOf}(Line(G,F)) = 5 \)).
   - \( Line(H,G) \) is a radius of a circle centered at \( H \) with length 5, indicating \( H \) is equidistant from all vertices of the hexagon.
   - Several equilateral triangles are formed with \( H \) as one vertex and two consecutive vertices of the hexagon as the other vertices (e.g., \( \triangle HGF \), \( \triangle HAC \)).
   - The area of the hexagon is given by \( 6 \times \text{AreaOf}(\triangle HGF) \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find the area of the regular hexagon \( A, C, D, E, F, G \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**:
   - Since \( \triangle HGF \) is equilateral with side length 5, we can calculate its area using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2
     \]
   - Substitute the side length:
     \[
     \text{Area}(\triangle HGF) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 5^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 25 = \frac{25\sqrt{3}}{4}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of the Hexagon**:
   - The area of the hexagon is \( 6 \times \text{Area}(\triangle HGF) \):
     \[
     \text{Area}(Hexagon) = 6 \times \frac{25\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{150\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Approximate \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \text{Area}(Hexagon) \approx \frac{75 \times 1.732}{2} = \frac{129.9}{2} = 64.95
     \]
   - Round to the nearest tenth: 65.0

6. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated area of the hexagon is 65.0, which matches choice C.

7. **Select the Closest Answer**:
   - The closest answer to our calculation is 65.0, which corresponds to choice C.

</think>
Solution:
- The area of the regular hexagon is calculated to be approximately 65.0 when rounded to the nearest tenth.
- Therefore, the correct answer is choice C.

Final Answer: C
