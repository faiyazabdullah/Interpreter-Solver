1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two parallelograms: \(ABCD\) and \(AEBF\).
   - Points \(W\), \(W'\), \(F\), \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) are specified.
   - Lines \(WW'\), \(W'F\), and \(WF\) are defined.
   - Lengths are given as \(WF = 14\), \(W'F = 10.5\), and \(WF = WW' + W'F\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length \(x\) of line \(WW'\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - From the equation \(WF = WW' + W'F\), we can substitute the known values:
     \[
     14 = x + 10.5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 14 - 10.5
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     x = 3.5
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Substitute back to check:
     \[
     WF = WW' + W'F \implies 14 = 3.5 + 10.5
     \]
   - The equation holds true, confirming the calculation is correct.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \(x = 3.5\) matches option A.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since \(x = 3.5\) is exactly one of the choices, select option A.

8. **Conclude:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the given constraints and the solution matches one of the provided options.
</think>

**Solution:**
- Using the equation \(WF = WW' + W'F\), we substitute the known values to find \(x\):
  \[
  14 = x + 10.5
  \]
  \[
  x = 14 - 10.5 = 3.5
  \]
- The calculated value of \(x\) is 3.5, which corresponds to option A.
