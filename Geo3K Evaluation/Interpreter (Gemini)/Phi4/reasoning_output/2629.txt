**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have three lines \(l\), \(m\), and \(n\) that are parallel to each other.
- Line \(t\) intersects all three lines at points \(B\), \(F\), and \(J\) respectively.
- We are given that the measure of \(\angle 9\) is 75 degrees.
- The sum of the measures of \(\angle 9\) and \(\angle 10\) is 180 degrees.
- The measure of \(\angle 6\) is equal to the measure of \(\angle 10\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 6\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since lines \(l\), \(m\), and \(n\) are parallel and line \(t\) is a transversal, angles formed at the intersections have specific relationships.
- \(\angle 9\) and \(\angle 10\) are on the same line \(l\) and are supplementary because they form a linear pair. Thus, \(\angle 9 + \angle 10 = 180^\circ\).
- Given \(\angle 9 = 75^\circ\), we can find \(\angle 10\) using the equation:
  \[
  \angle 10 = 180^\circ - \angle 9 = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ
  \]
- We are given that \(\angle 6 = \angle 10\). Therefore, \(\angle 6 = 105^\circ\).

**Step 4: Verify the Calculations**
- The calculation for \(\angle 10\) is correct as it follows directly from the supplementary angle relationship.
- Since \(\angle 6\) is given to be equal to \(\angle 10\), the measure of \(\angle 6\) is also 105 degrees.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle 6\) is 105 degrees.
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 75
  - B. 85
  - C. 95
  - D. 105
- The correct choice is D, which matches our calculated result.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the calculations and the given constraints, the measure of \(\angle 6\) is 105 degrees.

**Solution:**
Given the relationships and calculations, the measure of \(\angle 6\) is found to be 105 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
