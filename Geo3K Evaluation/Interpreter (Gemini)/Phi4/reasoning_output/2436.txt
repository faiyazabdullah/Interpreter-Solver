1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - Points A, B, C, D, and F are given.
   - Points A, B, C, and D lie on circle E.
   - Lines AD and BC intersect at point F.
   - Arc BC measures 30 degrees and arc AD measures 20 degrees.
   - Angle 2 is defined as being equal to half of the sum of the measures of arcs BC and AD.
   - Angle 1 is congruent to angle 2.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle 2, denoted as \( m \angle 2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Measure of Arc BC} + \text{Measure of Arc AD}) \).

3. **Calculating the Measure of Angle 2:**
   - Measure of Arc BC = 30 degrees.
   - Measure of Arc AD = 20 degrees.
   - Sum of the measures of arcs BC and AD = 30 + 20 = 50 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) degrees.

4. **Verification:**
   - The calculation aligns with the given formula for angle 2.
   - There are no additional constraints or conditions that alter this calculation.

5. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of angle 2 is 25 degrees.
   - Among the answer choices, 25 degrees corresponds to option B.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated measure of angle 2 matches one of the provided answer choices.
   - No further adjustments or considerations are needed.

<Solution>
To find \( m \angle 2 \), we used the given formula \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Measure of Arc BC} + \text{Measure of Arc AD}) \). Substituting the values, we calculated \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) degrees. This matches option B. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: B
