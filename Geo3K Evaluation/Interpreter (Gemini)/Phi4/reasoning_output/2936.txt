1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a right triangle \( \triangle NPM \) with \( \angle NPM \) as the right angle.
   - The sides are given as \( NP = 15 \), \( PM = 36 \), and \( NM = 39 \).
   - We need to express the ratio of \(\tan(M)\) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

2. **Identify the Relevant Information:**
   - Since \( \angle NPM \) is the right angle, \( NM \) is the hypotenuse.
   - We need to find \(\tan(M)\), where \( M \) is the angle opposite side \( NP \).

3. **Apply Trigonometric Definitions:**
   - \(\tan(M) = \frac{\text{opposite side to } M}{\text{adjacent side to } M}\).
   - In \(\triangle NPM\), the side opposite \( M \) is \( NP = 15 \), and the side adjacent to \( M \) is \( PM = 36 \).

4. **Calculate \(\tan(M)\):**
   - \(\tan(M) = \frac{NP}{PM} = \frac{15}{36}\).

5. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   - Simplify \(\frac{15}{36}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
   - \(\frac{15}{36} = \frac{15 \div 3}{36 \div 3} = \frac{5}{12}\).

6. **Convert to Decimal:**
   - Calculate \(\frac{5}{12}\) as a decimal.
   - \( \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167\).

7. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   - Round 0.4167 to the nearest hundredth, which is 0.42.

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(\tan(M)\) is 0.42.
   - Compare this with the given choices: A. 0.38, B. 0.42, C. 0.92, D. 2.40.
   - The closest match is B. 0.42.

9. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the calculations to ensure accuracy.
   - The steps and calculations align with the problem constraints and trigonometric definitions.
   - The rounding and comparison confirm the choice.

10. **Final Decision:**
    - Based on the calculations and comparison, the correct answer is B. 0.42.

**Solution:**
- We calculated \(\tan(M) = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167\).
- Rounding 0.4167 to the nearest hundredth gives 0.42.
- The closest answer choice is B. 0.42.
