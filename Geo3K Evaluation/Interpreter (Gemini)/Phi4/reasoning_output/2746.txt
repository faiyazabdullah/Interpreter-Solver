1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have a triangle with vertices A, B, and C.
   - Three line segments are given: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), and Line(A,C).
   - We have expressions for the lengths of these segments:
     - \( \text{Length of Line(A,B)} = 2x + 5 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(B,C)} = 3x - 4 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(A,C)} = 27 \)

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( AB \) (Length of Line(A,B)).

3. **Use the congruence condition:**
   - Line(A,B) is congruent to Line(B,C), meaning they have equal lengths:
     \[
     2x + 5 = 3x - 4
     \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     2x + 5 = 3x - 4 \implies 5 + 4 = 3x - 2x \implies 9 = x
     \]

5. **Calculate the length of Line(A,B):**
   - Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the expression for Line(A,B):
     \[
     \text{Length of Line(A,B)} = 2x + 5 = 2(9) + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
     \]

6. **Verify the calculation for Line(B,C):**
   - Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the expression for Line(B,C):
     \[
     \text{Length of Line(B,C)} = 3x - 4 = 3(9) - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23
     \]
   - This confirms that Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are indeed equal, as required by the congruence condition.

7. **Check the triangle inequality:**
   - Verify that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality:
     - \( AB + BC = 23 + 23 = 46 > 27 = AC \)
     - \( AB + AC = 23 + 27 = 50 > 23 = BC \)
     - \( BC + AC = 23 + 27 = 50 > 23 = AB \)
   - All conditions are satisfied.

8. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - The calculated length of AB is 23, which matches option A.

9. **Select the closest answer choice:**
   - Since 23 is an exact match with option A, choose A.

</think>

<Solution>
- The calculated length of Line(A,B) is 23.
- The answer choice that matches this calculation is A.
- Therefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: A
