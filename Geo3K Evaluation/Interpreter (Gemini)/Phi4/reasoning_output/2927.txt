### Thought Process

**Step 1: Understanding the Given Information**

- We have two trapezoids, \( JKLM \) and \( QRST \), which are similar. This means all corresponding angles are equal, and the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional.
- The area of \( JKLM \) is 138 square feet, and the area of \( QRST \) is 5.52 square feet.
- The length of \( JK \) is given as 5 feet.
- We need to find the length \( x \) of \( QT \).

**Step 2: Analyzing the Similarity Condition**

- Since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
- Given: 
  \[
  \frac{\text{Area of } QRST}{\text{Area of } JKLM} = \left(\frac{\text{Length of } QT}{\text{Length of } JK}\right)^2
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{5.52}{138} = \left(\frac{x}{5}\right)^2
  \]

**Step 3: Calculating the Ratio of Areas**

- Calculate the ratio of the areas:
  \[
  \frac{5.52}{138} = 0.04
  \]

**Step 4: Solving for \( x \)**

- Set up the equation:
  \[
  0.04 = \left(\frac{x}{5}\right)^2
  \]
- Solve for \( \frac{x}{5} \):
  \[
  \frac{x}{5} = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 0.2 \times 5 = 1
  \]

**Step 5: Verification and Comparison**

- Verify the calculations:
  - \( \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2 \) is correct.
  - \( x = 1 \) matches the calculations.
- Compare \( x = 1 \) with the answer choices: A. 0.2, B. 1, C. 25, D. 125.
- The calculated value \( x = 1 \) matches choice B.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and the properties of similar figures.
- The closest and correct answer choice is B.

**Solution**

The value of \( x \) is calculated to be 1, based on the similarity ratio and the given areas of the trapezoids. Therefore, the correct answer is:
