1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - Points A, B, and C lie on the circle with center D.
   - Line AB is a diameter of Circle D.
   - Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
   - AC = 8 inches and BC = 15 inches.
   - AB is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the radius of Circle D.

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties:**
   - Since AB is a diameter and triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C, by the Thales' theorem, the hypotenuse AB must be the diameter of the circle.
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC to find the length of AB:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289
     \]
     \[
     AB = \sqrt{289} = 17
     \]
   - Since AB is the diameter of the circle, the radius is half of the diameter:
     \[
     \text{Radius} = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
     \]

4. **Verify calculations and compare with answer choices:**
   - The calculated radius is 8.5 inches.
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 7.5, B. 8, C. 8.5, D. 17.
   - The closest and exact match to our calculated radius is option C, which is 8.5.

5. **Reflect and ensure all steps are correct:**
   - Reassess the application of the Pythagorean theorem and the calculation of the radius.
   - Confirm that the geometric constraints align with the properties used (Thales' theorem and the Pythagorean theorem).

6. **Select the correct answer:**
   - Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option C.
</think>
**Solution:**
- Using the Pythagorean theorem, we calculated the length of the diameter AB as 17 inches.
- The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, which is 8.5 inches.
- Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is option C.

Final Answer: C
