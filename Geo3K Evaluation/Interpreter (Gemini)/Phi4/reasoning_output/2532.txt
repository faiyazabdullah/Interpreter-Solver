**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**

We are given a circle with center A, and points B, C, D, and E lying on this circle. There are several angles provided:
- \( \angle DAB = 85^\circ \)
- \( \angle DAC = 150^\circ \)
- \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \)
- \( \angle CAE = x^\circ \)

Additionally, we are told that \( \angle BAE \) is a right angle and that the sum of the measures of these angles around point A is 360 degrees:
\[ \text{Sum}(\angle DAB, \angle DAC, \angle BAE, \angle CAE) = 360^\circ \]

**Step 2: Summing the Known Angles**

We know:
- \( \angle DAB = 85^\circ \)
- \( \angle DAC = 150^\circ \)
- \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \)

Adding these known angles:
\[ 85^\circ + 150^\circ + 90^\circ = 325^\circ \]

**Step 3: Calculating the Unknown Angle**

Since the sum of all angles around point A is 360 degrees, we can find \( \angle CAE \) by subtracting the sum of the known angles from 360 degrees:
\[ \angle CAE = 360^\circ - 325^\circ = 35^\circ \]

**Step 4: Verifying the Calculation**

We have calculated \( \angle CAE = 35^\circ \). We need to ensure this fits within the context of the problem:
- The angles \( \angle DAB \), \( \angle DAC \), \( \angle BAE \), and \( \angle CAE \) are around the same point A.
- The sum of these angles is indeed 360 degrees, which confirms our calculation is consistent with the given constraints.

**Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \( \angle CAE \) is \( 35^\circ \). Among the answer choices:
- A. 30
- B. 35
- C. 45
- D. 85

The closest and exact match is option B, which is 35.

**Step 6: Final Verification**

Revisiting the problem constraints and calculations, everything checks out, confirming that \( \angle CAE = 35^\circ \) is correct.

<Solution>

Based on the systematic analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle CAE \) is \( 35^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
