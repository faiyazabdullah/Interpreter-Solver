1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have points A, B, C, D, E, F.
   - Lines AD, BE, and CF intersect at points A and C.
   - Lines AD and EC are parallel.
   - We need to find the measure of angle FCE, given that lines AD and EC are parallel.

2. **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - Since lines AD and EC are parallel and intersected by line CF, angles DAE and FCE are corresponding angles and thus equal.
   - We have the equations for the angles:
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle DAC = 3x - 60 \)
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle FCE = 2x + 15 \)
   - It is given that \( \text{Measure of } \angle DAC = \text{Measure of } \angle FCE \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since \( \angle DAC = \angle FCE \), we equate the expressions:
     \[
     3x - 60 = 2x + 15
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     3x - 2x = 15 + 60
     \]
     \[
     x = 75
     \]

5. **Find the Measure of \( \angle FCE \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 75 \) into the expression for \( \angle FCE \):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle FCE = 2x + 15 = 2(75) + 15 = 150 + 15 = 165
     \]

6. **Reassess the Calculation:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle FCE \) is 165, which does not match any of the provided answer choices.
   - Re-evaluate the problem constraints and calculations to ensure no errors were made.

7. **Consider the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated measure of 165 is not close to any of the provided choices (105, 110, 115, 120).
   - Reassess the setup: Since \( \angle DAC = \angle FCE \) and they are corresponding angles, the setup seems correct.
   - Recheck the equation setup and solution:
     - \( 3x - 60 = 2x + 15 \) was solved correctly.
     - \( x = 75 \) was calculated correctly.
     - \( \angle FCE = 165 \) was calculated correctly.

8. **Reflect on Possible Misinterpretation:**
   - Given the constraints and the setup, the calculation is consistent.
   - The closest logical step is to consider if there was a misinterpretation of the problem setup or if additional constraints were overlooked.
   - However, the calculations align with the given conditions.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Since the calculated angle does not match any choices, and the closest logical step is to choose the closest value, we select the closest provided option.
   - The closest value to 165 is 120.

</think>

**Solution:**
- The calculated measure of \( \angle FCE \) is 165.
- The closest answer choice to 165 is 120.
