**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle WXY \) with points \( W, X, Y \).
- \( Z \) lies on line \( WY \) and is the midpoint of \( WY \).
- \( XZ \) is perpendicular to \( WY \).
- \( \angle XZY \) and \( \angle XZW \) are right angles.
- \( XZ \) is an altitude of \( \triangle WXY \).
- \( WX = XY = 12 \).
- \( WZ = ZY \) (since \( Z \) is the midpoint of \( WY \)).
- \( \triangle WXY \) is isosceles with \( WX = XY \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find \( XW \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( Z \) is the midpoint of \( WY \) and \( XZ \) is perpendicular to \( WY \), \( XZ \) is the altitude from \( X \) to \( WY \).
- In \( \triangle WXY \), since \( WX = XY = 12 \), and it is isosceles, \( X \) is equidistant from \( W \) and \( Y \).
- \( Z \) being the midpoint of \( WY \) implies \( WZ = ZY \).
- Since \( XZ \) is perpendicular to \( WY \) and is an altitude, \( \triangle XZW \) and \( \triangle XZY \) are right triangles.

**Step 4: Calculate Using Pythagorean Theorem**

- Let \( WZ = ZY = a \). Then \( WY = 2a \).
- Since \( XZ \) is perpendicular to \( WY \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle XZW \):
  \[
  XW^2 = XZ^2 + WZ^2
  \]
- Similarly, in \( \triangle XZY \):
  \[
  XY^2 = XZ^2 + ZY^2
  \]
- Since \( XY = 12 \) and \( ZY = WZ = a \), we have:
  \[
  12^2 = XZ^2 + a^2
  \]
  \[
  144 = XZ^2 + a^2
  \]

- Also, since \( WX = 12 \), using \( \triangle XZW \):
  \[
  12^2 = XZ^2 + a^2
  \]
  \[
  144 = XZ^2 + a^2
  \]

- These equations confirm that \( XZ^2 + a^2 = 144 \).

**Step 5: Solve for \( XW \)**

- Since \( XW = XY = 12 \) and \( XZ \) is the altitude, we need to find \( XW \) using the fact that \( XZ \) is perpendicular and \( WZ = ZY \).
- Using the midpoint property and symmetry in the isosceles triangle:
  \[
  WY = 2a
  \]
  \[
  XW^2 = XZ^2 + WZ^2 = XZ^2 + a^2
  \]
  \[
  XW^2 = 144
  \]
  \[
  XW = \sqrt{144} = 12
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( XW = 12 \).
- The answer choice that matches is \( B. 12 \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the geometric properties and calculations, \( XW \) is determined to be 12. This matches answer choice B.
