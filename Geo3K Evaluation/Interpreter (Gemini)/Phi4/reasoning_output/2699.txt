**Thought Section:**

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We are given a circle \( \odot X \) with points \( A, B, C, D, Y, Z \) lying on the circle.
- Lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of the circle, each with a length of 30 units, and they are congruent.
- Line \( XY \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) and intersects it at point \( M \), which is the midpoint of \( AB \).
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is 40 degrees.
- We need to find the length of \( ND \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are congruent chords, they are equidistant from the center \( X \).
- \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( AM = MB = 15 \).
- \( XY \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) at \( M \), forming right angles at \( \angle AMX \) and \( \angle BMX \).

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Properties**
- Since \( M \) is the midpoint and \( XY \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), \( XM \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( AB \).
- Similarly, \( ND \) will be the perpendicular bisector of \( CD \) since \( CD \) is congruent to \( AB \).

**Step 4: Use Arc and Chord Properties**
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is 40 degrees, which implies that \( \angle CXZ = 20 \) degrees (since the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference).
- Since \( CD \) is a chord of 30 units, and \( \angle CXZ = 20 \) degrees, we can use the properties of the circle to find \( ND \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( ND \) Using Geometry**
- Since \( CD \) is a chord of 30 units, and \( \angle CXZ = 20 \) degrees, we can use the formula for the perpendicular distance from the center to a chord:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{r^2 - \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2}
  \]
  where \( d \) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, \( r \) is the radius, and \( c \) is the chord length.
- We know \( AM = MB = 15 \) and \( \angle AMX = 90^\circ \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AMX \):
  \[
  XM = \sqrt{AX^2 - AM^2}
  \]
  Since \( XM \) is the same as \( XN \) (both are perpendicular bisectors of congruent chords), we can find \( XN \) using the same approach.

**Step 6: Determine \( ND \)**
- Since \( \angle CXZ = 20^\circ \), \( \angle DXZ = 20^\circ \) (because \( \angle CXD = 40^\circ \)).
- Using the sine rule in \( \triangle DXZ \):
  \[
  \frac{DX}{\sin(20^\circ)} = \frac{30}{\sin(160^\circ)}
  \]
  \[
  DX = \frac{30 \cdot \sin(20^\circ)}{\sin(160^\circ)}
  \]
  Since \( \sin(160^\circ) = \sin(20^\circ) \), \( DX = 30 \).

- Now, using the right triangle \( \triangle XND \):
  \[
  ND = DX \cdot \sin(20^\circ)
  \]
  \[
  ND = 30 \cdot \sin(20^\circ)
  \]

**Step 7: Calculate and Compare**
- Using \( \sin(20^\circ) \approx 0.342 \):
  \[
  ND \approx 30 \cdot 0.342 = 10.26
  \]

- Comparing with the answer choices, the closest value is 10.

**Step 8: Final Verification**
- Reassess all steps and calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Confirm that the geometric properties and calculations align with the given constraints.

**Conclusion:**
- The calculated value of \( ND \) is approximately 10.26, which is closest to option A.

**Solution Section:**
- Based on the geometric analysis and calculations, the length \( ND \) is closest to 10.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
