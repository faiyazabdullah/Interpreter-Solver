1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**:
   - We have points A, B, C, D, and E.
   - There are two lines: Line(A, B) and Line(C, D) that intersect at Point E and are perpendicular to each other.
   - The angles formed at the intersection are all right angles: Angle(A, E, C), Angle(C, E, B), Angle(B, E, D), and Angle(D, E, A) are all 90 degrees.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings**:
   - Since Line(A, B) is perpendicular to Line(C, D), and they intersect at Point E, the intersection forms four right angles.
   - Each angle measure is given as 90 degrees.
   - The problem asks us to find 'x', but 'x' is not explicitly defined in the constraints. However, since the angles at the intersection are 90 degrees, and all angle measures are equal to 90, 'x' might refer to one of these angle measures.

3. **Brainstorming New Ideas**:
   - Given that all angles at the intersection are 90 degrees, it is logical to consider that 'x' refers to one of these angles.
   - The problem might be asking for the measure of one of these right angles.

4. **Verifying the Accuracy of Current Steps**:
   - The geometric constraints and angle measures are consistent with the properties of perpendicular lines intersecting, forming right angles.
   - The measure of each angle is explicitly given as 90 degrees.

5. **Refining Any Errors**:
   - There are no apparent errors in the understanding of the problem. The constraints are straightforward, and the measures are clearly defined.

6. **Revisiting Previous Steps**:
   - Reassessing the problem confirms that 'x' is likely referring to the measure of one of the right angles at the intersection.
   - The problem does not provide any additional information or context that would suggest 'x' refers to something other than these angles.

7. **Iterative Reflection**:
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the only logical conclusion is that 'x' is the measure of one of the right angles formed by the intersection of the perpendicular lines.
   - Therefore, 'x' should be 90 degrees.

</think>

<Solution>
- Based on the given constraints, all angles at the intersection of Line(A, B) and Line(C, D) are right angles, each measuring 90 degrees.
- The problem asks to find 'x', which, given the context and the constraints, refers to the measure of one of these right angles.
- Therefore, 'x' is 90 degrees.
- Comparing this with the answer choices, the closest and correct choice is 90.

Final Answer: C. 90
