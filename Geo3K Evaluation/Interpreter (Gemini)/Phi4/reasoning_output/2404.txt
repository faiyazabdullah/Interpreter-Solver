**Step 1: Understand the Given Geometric Constraints**
- Circle \( M \) with points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( T \) on its circumference.
- Line \( AC \) is a chord of the circle.
- Line \( AT \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( T \) is a point on the circle such that line \( TB \) is perpendicular to line \( AM \).
- \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( AM \).
- \( MB \) is congruent to \( MD \).
- \( B \) is the intersection of \( AM \) and \( TB \).
- \( D \) is the intersection of \( AM \) and \( AD \).
- \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BD \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BD \), indicating that \( BM = MD \).
- Since \( MB = MD \) and \( M \) is the midpoint, \( B \) and \( D \) are equidistant from \( M \).
- \( TB \perp AM \) and \( AD \perp AM \) suggest that \( T \), \( B \), and \( D \) are collinear with respect to perpendicularity to \( AM \).

**Step 3: Analyze the Geometry**
- Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BD \) and \( MB = MD \), \( B \) and \( D \) are symmetric with respect to \( M \).
- \( TB \perp AM \) implies that \( \angle TBA = 90^\circ \).
- \( AD \perp AM \) implies that \( \angle DAM = 90^\circ \).

**Step 4: Explore the Implications for \( \angle CAM \)**
- Since \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( T \) lie on the circle, \( \angle CAM \) is an inscribed angle.
- The perpendiculars \( TB \perp AM \) and \( AD \perp AM \) suggest a symmetry or special configuration.
- \( M \) being the midpoint of \( BD \) and \( MB = MD \) implies that \( \triangle BMD \) is isosceles with \( \angle BMD = 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Apply Geometric Theorems**
- Since \( \angle BMD = 90^\circ \) and \( M \) is the midpoint, \( \triangle BMD \) is a right isosceles triangle.
- The perpendiculars and symmetry suggest that \( \angle CAM \) is related to the central angle \( \angle CBM \).
- \( \angle CBM \) subtends the arc \( CM \), and since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BD \), \( \angle CBM = 45^\circ \).

**Step 6: Calculate \( \angle CAM \)**
- Since \( \angle CBM = 45^\circ \) and \( \angle CAM \) is half of \( \angle CBM \) (inscribed angle theorem), \( \angle CAM = \frac{1}{2} \times 45^\circ = 22.5^\circ \).

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The closest answer choice to \( 22.5^\circ \) is \( 28^\circ \).

**Step 8: Verify and Conclude**
- Reassess the symmetry and perpendicularity constraints to ensure no oversight.
- Given the constraints and calculations, \( \angle CAM \) is closest to \( 28^\circ \).

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the symmetry of the configuration, the inscribed angle \( \angle CAM \) is calculated to be closest to \( 28^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
