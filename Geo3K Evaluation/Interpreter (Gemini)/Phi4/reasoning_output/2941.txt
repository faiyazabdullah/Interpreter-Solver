**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a square \(ABDC\) inscribed in a circle with center \(F\). This implies that the circle is the circumcircle of the square.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) all lie on the circle. 
- Lines \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diagonals of the square and intersect at point \(F\), which is also the center of the circle.
- The diagonals of the square are perpendicular and bisect each other at the center of the square.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- The problem asks for the measure of a central angle. A central angle in a circle is an angle whose vertex is the center of the circle and whose sides are radii that intersect the circumference.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \(ABDC\) is a square inscribed in the circle, its diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diameters of the circle. 
- The diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).
- The central angle subtended by each side of the square (e.g., \(AB\)) is the angle at the center \(F\) between the radii \(FA\) and \(FB\).

**Step 4: Calculate the Central Angle**

- The circle is divided into four equal arcs by the square's vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The full circle is \(360^\circ\). Since the square divides the circle into four equal arcs, each arc subtends a central angle of:
  \[
  \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated central angle is \(90^\circ\).
- Among the given answer choices, \(90^\circ\) corresponds to option C.

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**

- All calculations and logical deductions align with the properties of a square inscribed in a circle.
- The central angle subtended by each side of the square is indeed \(90^\circ\).

Solution:
The measure of a central angle in the given configuration is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.

Final Answer: C
