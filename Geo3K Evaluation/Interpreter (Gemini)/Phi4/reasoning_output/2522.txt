**Step 1: Analyzing the given geometric constraints**
- We have points A, B, C, D, and E.
- Lines AE, AB, BC, ED, CD, and BE are specified with certain lengths.
- AE = 3, AB = 2, BC = 6, ED = 2x - 3.
- Lines AB and CD are parallel.
- Triangles ABE and CDE are similar.
- The quadrilateral BCDE is formed.
- Triangles ABE and CDE share point E and lines AE and DE are sides for both triangles.

**Step 2: Summarizing relevant findings**
- Similarity of triangles ABE and CDE implies that the corresponding sides are proportional.
- From similarity, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal: AB/CD = BE/DE = AE/CE.
- Given AE = 3 and ED = 2x - 3, we need to find the value of x.

**Step 3: Applying geometric theorems and properties**
- Use the similarity property: AB/CD = AE/CE.
- Since AB = 2 and AE = 3, we need to find CD and CE to set up a proportion.
- From the quadrilateral BCDE, CD is a side opposite to AB, and they are parallel.
- From the problem, we know BC = 6.

**Step 4: Calculating CD using parallel lines and similarity**
- Since AB is parallel to CD, and triangles ABE and CDE are similar, the ratio AB/CD = AE/CE.
- The length of CD can be found using the fact that triangles ABE and CDE are similar.
- Let's denote CD as y. From similarity, we have:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AE}{CE}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{3}{CE}
  \]

**Step 5: Finding CE using triangle properties**
- Since BCDE is a quadrilateral and CD is opposite to AB, consider the entire length from B to D.
- The line BE is a common side in both triangles ABE and CDE.
- Since AB || CD, and considering the similarity, the segments are proportional.
- Using the proportionality, we can set up:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BE}{DE}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{BE}{2x - 3}
  \]

**Step 6: Solving for x**
- We need to find BE to solve for x. Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{CE} = \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BE}{DE}
  \]
- Let's assume BE = k, then DE = 2x - 3.
- From similarity:
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{k}{2x - 3}
  \]
- We also know:
  \[
  \frac{3}{CE} = \frac{2}{y}
  \]
  \[
  CE = \frac{3y}{2}
  \]

**Step 7: Using the known lengths to solve for x**
- Since BC = 6 and CD = y, and using the similarity:
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{3}{\frac{3y}{2}}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{2}{y}
  \]
- This confirms the proportionality is consistent.
- Now, using the similarity ratio:
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{k}{2x - 3}
  \]
- We need to find k using the similarity:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{CE} = \frac{3}{\frac{3y}{2}} = \frac{2}{y}
  \]
- From the similarity and given lengths:
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{k}{2x - 3}
  \]
- Assume k = BE = 4 (since AB + BE = AE + some length to E):
  \[
  \frac{2}{y} = \frac{4}{2x - 3}
  \]
  \[
  2(2x - 3) = 4y
  \]
  \[
  4x - 6 = 4y
  \]
  \[
  y = x - \frac{3}{2}
  \]

**Step 8: Solving for x using known lengths**
- Since CD = y and BC = 6, and using the similarity:
  \[
  y = 6 - 2
  \]
  \[
  y = 4
  \]
- Substitute y = 4 into the equation:
  \[
  4 = x - \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4 + \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2} + \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{11}{2}
  \]

**Step 9: Selecting the closest answer choice**
- The calculated value of x is 5.5.
- The closest answer choice is 6.

</think>

<Solution>
- Based on the calculations and the similarity of triangles, the closest value for x is 6.
- Final Answer: B
