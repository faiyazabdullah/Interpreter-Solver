**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on circle \( P \).
- Line \( MA \) and line \( MC \) are tangents to circle \( P \).
- The lengths of \( MA \) and \( MC \) are equal, and both are 10 units.
- Line \( BC \) has a length of 6 units.
- Point \( B \) lies on line \( MC \).
- The length of \( MC \) is equal to the sum of the lengths of \( MB \) and \( BC \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the length \( y \) of \( MB \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**

- Since \( MA \) and \( MC \) are tangents from point \( M \) to circle \( P \), they are equal in length.
- The power of a point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line through the point is equal to the square of the length of the tangent segment from the point to the circle.
- Here, \( MB + BC = MC \).

**Step 4: Set Up Equations**

- From the constraint \( MC = MA = 10 \), we have:
  \[
  MC = MB + BC = 10
  \]
- Given \( BC = 6 \), substitute into the equation:
  \[
  MB + 6 = 10
  \]
- Solve for \( MB \):
  \[
  MB = 10 - 6 = 4
  \]

**Step 5: Verify Calculations**

- Check if the calculations align with the constraints:
  - \( MB = 4 \)
  - \( MB + BC = 4 + 6 = 10 \), which matches \( MC = 10 \).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length \( MB = 4 \).
- The closest answer choice to 4 is \( A. 5 \).

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the calculations and comparison with the answer choices, the closest value is 5.

<Solution>
The length \( y \) of \( MB \) is calculated to be 4. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest value is 5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
