1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - Points A, B, C, D, and F exist, and points A, B, C, and D lie on a circle centered at F.
   - Lines AC and BD intersect at F.
   - We have several angles involving these points: \(\angle AFB\), \(\angle AFD\), \(\angle ACF\), \(\angle CFD\), \(\angle ADF\), and \(\angle DFA\).
   - The measure of \(\angle AFB\) is given as 72 degrees.
   - It is stated that \(\angle AFB = \angle CFD\), so \(\angle CFD\) also measures 72 degrees.
   - The measure of \(\angle AFD\) is \((4a - 1)\).
   - The measure of \(\angle ADF\) is \((2a - 5)\).
   - The sum of angles in \(\triangle ADF\) is 180 degrees.
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle CFD\).

2. **Identifying the Need:**
   - We are required to confirm the measure of \(\angle CFD\) and choose the closest answer from the options given.

3. **Using Angle Sum Property in \(\triangle ADF\):**
   - We know that \(\angle ADF + \angle AFD + \angle DFA = 180\).
   - Substituting the given expressions: \((2a - 5) + (4a - 1) + \angle DFA = 180\).
   - Simplifying: \(6a - 6 + \angle DFA = 180\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle DFA = 180 - 6a + 6 = 186 - 6a\).

4. **Using the Given Equality:**
   - \(\angle AFB = \angle CFD\), and \(\angle AFB = 72\) degrees, thus \(\angle CFD = 72\) degrees.

5. **Checking for Consistency:**
   - We need to ensure the angles make sense with the circle and intersecting lines.
   - Since \(\angle AFB = 72\) and \(\angle CFD = 72\), the setup is consistent with the circle and intersecting lines.
   - The calculation for \(\angle DFA\) as \(186 - 6a\) is consistent with the angle sum property.

6. **Finding \(a\):**
   - Using \(\angle ADF + \angle AFD + \angle DFA = 180\):
     \[
     (2a - 5) + (4a - 1) + (186 - 6a) = 180
     \]
     \[
     2a - 5 + 4a - 1 + 186 - 6a = 180
     \]
     \[
     180 = 180
     \]
   - This confirms our expressions are consistent, and no specific value of \(a\) is needed beyond ensuring consistency.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \(\angle CFD\) is directly given as 72 degrees from the equality \(\angle AFB = \angle CFD\).
   - We need to find the closest answer choice to 72 degrees from the options provided.

8. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are: A. 115, B. 119, C. 120, D. 123.
   - The closest value to 72 is not directly listed, but the problem setup and consistency checks confirm that \(\angle CFD = 72\).

9. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - Since the calculated measure is 72 and none of the choices match exactly, we must select the closest logical option.
   - The problem might have a typo or misalignment, but based on the setup, the closest logical step is to select the smallest available option, which is A. 115, as it is the smallest deviation from the expected 72.
