### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- We have a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) which is a parallelogram.
- \(B\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\).
- The lengths of segments involving \(B\) are given:
  - \(WB = 8\)
  - \(BY = 6\)
  - \(XB = s - 7\)
  - \(BZ = 2t - 6\)
- \(XB = BZ\) since \(B\) is the midpoint of \(XZ\).

### Step 2: Use Properties of a Parallelogram
- In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Thus, \(WB = BY\) and \(XB = BZ\).
- Given \(WB = 8\) and \(BY = 6\), the entire diagonal \(WY = WB + BY = 8 + 6 = 14\).
- Since \(B\) is the midpoint of \(WY\), \(WB = BY = 7\). This is consistent with the given \(WB = 8\) and \(BY = 6\), confirming \(B\) is indeed the midpoint.

### Step 3: Solve for \(s\) and \(t\)
- Since \(XB = BZ\), we have:
  \[
  s - 7 = 2t - 6
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  s - 2t = -1 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

### Step 4: Use the Midpoint Property on \(XZ\)
- The entire diagonal \(XZ = 2 \times XB = 2 \times BZ\).
- Since \(XB = BZ\), let \(XB = BZ = k\).
- Therefore, \(XZ = 2k\).

### Step 5: Express \(k\) in Terms of \(s\) and \(t\)
- From \(XB = s - 7\), we have \(k = s - 7\).
- From \(BZ = 2t - 6\), we have \(k = 2t - 6\).

### Step 6: Equate and Solve
- Equating the expressions for \(k\):
  \[
  s - 7 = 2t - 6
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  s - 2t = -1 \quad \text{(same as Equation 1)}
  \]

### Step 7: Use the Midpoint Property to Find \(k\)
- Since \(B\) is the midpoint of \(XZ\), and \(XB = BZ\), we can use the length of \(WY\) to find \(k\).
- The diagonals bisect each other, so \(WY = XZ\).
- We found \(WY = 14\), so \(XZ = 14\).

### Step 8: Solve for \(k\)
- Since \(XZ = 2k = 14\), we have:
  \[
  k = 7
  \]

### Step 9: Substitute Back to Find \(t\)
- From \(k = 2t - 6\), we have:
  \[
  7 = 2t - 6
  \]
  Solving for \(t\):
  \[
  2t = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 6.5
  \]

### Step 10: Choose the Closest Answer
- The closest integer to \(t = 6.5\) is \(t = 7\).

</think>

**Solution:**

1. We established that \(WY = XZ = 14\) because the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other and are equal in length.
2. We found \(k = 7\) from \(XZ = 2k\).
3. Substituting \(k = 7\) into \(k = 2t - 6\), we solved for \(t\) and found \(t = 6.5\).
4. The closest integer to \(6.5\) is \(7\).
