**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

We are given a rhombus \(FGHJ\) with specific geometric properties:
- The diagonals \(FH\) and \(GJ\) intersect at point \(K\).
- \(GH = x + 9\)
- \(JH = 5x - 2\)
- \(GH = JH\) (since sides of a rhombus are equal)

**Step 2: Understand the Properties of a Rhombus**

In a rhombus:
- All sides are equal.
- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**

Since \(GH = JH\), we can set up the equation:
\[
x + 9 = 5x - 2
\]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**

Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
\[
x + 9 = 5x - 2
\]
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
\[
9 = 4x - 2
\]
Add 2 to both sides:
\[
11 = 4x
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculation**

Check the calculation:
- Substitute \(x = 2.75\) back into the expressions for \(GH\) and \(JH\):
  - \(GH = 2.75 + 9 = 11.75\)
  - \(JH = 5(2.75) - 2 = 13.75 - 2 = 11.75\)

Both are equal, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \(x\) is 2.75, which matches answer choice A.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

The calculations confirm that the value of \(x\) is indeed 2.75, and this matches one of the provided answer choices.

</think>

**Solution:**

To find the value of \(x\), we set the expressions for \(GH\) and \(JH\) equal to each other because they are sides of the rhombus and thus equal:
\[
x + 9 = 5x - 2
\]
Solving this equation:
\[
9 = 4x - 2
\]
\[
11 = 4x
\]
\[
x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
\]

The calculated value of \(x\) is 2.75, which corresponds to answer choice A.
