**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have two rectangles: Rectangle(1) and Rectangle(A,B,C,D).
- For Rectangle(1):
  - Width = 4
  - Area = 8
  - From the area formula \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \), we can find the length:
    \[
    \text{Length} \times 4 = 8 \implies \text{Length} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
    \]
  - Length of Line(A,B) is given as 0, which seems contradictory. This might be a mistake or misinterpretation in the problem statement.

- For Rectangle(A,B,C,D):
  - Area = 32
  - It is similar to Rectangle(1).

**Step 2: Understand Similarity**

- Similar figures have proportional corresponding side lengths.
- The ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Areas**

- Area of Rectangle(1) = 8
- Area of Rectangle(A,B,C,D) = 32
- Ratio of areas = \(\frac{32}{8} = 4\)

**Step 4: Determine the Ratio of Corresponding Side Lengths**

- Let the ratio of corresponding side lengths be \( r \).
- Since the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the side lengths:
  \[
  r^2 = 4 \implies r = \sqrt{4} = 2
  \]

**Step 5: Apply the Ratio to Find \( x \)**

- The width of Rectangle(1) is 4. The corresponding width of Rectangle(A,B,C,D) is \( 4 \times r = 4 \times 2 = 8 \).
- The length of Rectangle(1) is 2. The corresponding length of Rectangle(A,B,C,D) is \( 2 \times r = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

**Step 6: Verify and Compare**

- The dimensions of Rectangle(A,B,C,D) should be 8 (width) and 4 (length).
- The area calculated with these dimensions is \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \), which matches the given area.
- The problem asks to find \( x \), which is the scaling factor for the side lengths, and we found \( r = 2 \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated scaling factor \( r = 2 \).
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 1, B. 2, C. 8, D. 16.
- The closest match is B. 2.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the scaling factor \( r \) for the similar rectangles is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:
