**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints.**

- We have two constraints regarding the length of the line segment \( CQ \):
  - \( \text{Length}(CQ) = 5 \)
  - \( \text{Length}(CQ) = 15 \)

This indicates that there are two different situations or conditions involving \( CQ \).

- We also have a ratio condition:
  - \( \text{Ratio}(\text{Length}(CQ), \text{Length}(CQ)) \)

  This seems redundant because any number divided by itself is 1, which doesn't provide new information.

- There is a similarity condition:
  - \( \text{Similar(Square(1), Square(2))} \)

  This indicates that the squares are geometrically similar, meaning their corresponding angles are equal and their sides are proportional.

- There is a scale factor condition:
  - \( \text{ScaleFactorOf(Square(1), Square(2))} \)

  This implies that there is a constant ratio between the sides of Square 1 and Square 2.

- The line \( QC \) is a side of both squares:
  - \( \text{IsSideOf}(QC, \text{Square(1)}) \)
  - \( \text{IsSideOf}(QC, \text{Square(2)}) \)

**Step 2: Determine the scale factor.**

Given that \( QC \) is a side of both squares and the squares are similar, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides (which are \( QC \) in this case) will give us the scale factor.

- In one scenario, \( \text{Length}(CQ) = 5 \).
- In another scenario, \( \text{Length}(CQ) = 15 \).

The scale factor from Square 1 to Square 2 (or vice versa) is the ratio of these lengths:

\[
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Length of } CQ \text{ in Square 2}}{\text{Length of } CQ \text{ in Square 1}} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**

- The calculated scale factor is 3, which matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 4: Select the closest answer choice.**

- The answer choices are A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5.
- The calculated scale factor is 3, which corresponds to choice B.

**Step 5: Finalize the answer.**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct answer is B.

</think>

**Solution:**

The scale factor from Square 1 to Square 2, given the lengths of \( CQ \) as 5 and 15, is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
