1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We have a circle \( A \) with a center at point \( A \) and a radius defined by line \( AB \).
   - The length of line \( AB \) is given as 3.
   - The area of circle \( A \) is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \pi \times (\text{radius})^2 \).

2. **Identifying Given and Required Information:**
   - The given length of \( AB \) is 3, which means the radius of circle \( A \) is 3.
   - We need to calculate the area of circle \( A \) using the given formula and round to the nearest tenth.

3. **Applying Relevant Formulas:**
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \).
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 3.14159 \times 3^2
     \]

4. **Performing Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 3^2 \):
     \[
     3^2 = 9
     \]
   - Then, calculate the area:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 3.14159 \times 9 = 28.27431
     \]

5. **Rounding to the Nearest Tenth:**
   - The calculated area is 28.27431.
   - Rounding 28.27431 to the nearest tenth gives 28.3.

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The possible choices are:
     - A. 9.4
     - B. 18.8
     - C. 28.3
     - D. 37.7
   - Our calculated and rounded area of 28.3 matches option C.

7. **Verification:**
   - Rechecking the calculations confirms that the steps and calculations are correct.
   - The final rounded result matches one of the provided answer choices.

<Solution>
To find the area of circle \( A \), we used the given radius of 3. The formula for the area of a circle is \( \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \). Substituting the known values, we calculated the area as follows:

\[
\text{Area} = 3.14159 \times 3^2 = 3.14159 \times 9 = 28.27431
\]

Rounding 28.27431 to the nearest tenth gives 28.3. Comparing this with the answer choices, we find that the closest match is option C. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: C
