**Thought Section:**

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \( L \) with points \( A, B, D, \) and \( F \) lying on it. These points form chords \( AB \) and \( DF \).
   - Points \( C \) and \( E \) lie on lines \( AB \) and \( DF \), respectively.
   - Line \( CE \) is a diameter of circle \( L \) and is perpendicular to both lines \( AB \) and \( DF \).

2. **Analyzing the Arcs:**
   - We are given that arcs \( AD \) and \( BF \) are congruent, meaning they have the same measure.
   - The measure of arc \( AD \) is given by \( 2x + 14 \).
   - The measure of arc \( BF \) is given by \( 9x \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Since the arcs are congruent, their measures are equal:
     \[
     2x + 14 = 9x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     14 = 9x - 2x
     \]
     \[
     14 = 7x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{14}{7} = 2
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the expressions for the arc measures:
     - Measure of arc \( AD = 2(2) + 14 = 4 + 14 = 18 \)
     - Measure of arc \( BF = 9(2) = 18 \)
   - Both measures are equal, confirming the arcs are congruent.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the given conditions, and \( x = 2 \) satisfies all constraints.

**Solution Section:**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) that satisfies all the given conditions is \( 2 \).
