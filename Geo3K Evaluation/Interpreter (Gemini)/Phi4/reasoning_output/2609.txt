1. **Analyze the Given Information**:
   - We have a circle with center M. Points F, G, H, J, K, P, L, N, and M lie on the circle.
   - F, G, H, J, K, and P are points on the circle.
   - Several lines are defined with given relationships: 
     - \( FG \), \( HJ \), \( KL \), \( MP \), \( KM \), and \( LM \).
   - Lines intersect at specific points: \( L \) and \( N \).
   - \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FG \) and \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \).
   - \( FG \) and \( HJ \) are chords of the circle.
   - Several lines are radii: \( MF \), \( MG \), \( MH \), \( MJ \), \( MK \), and \( MP \).
   - Given lengths: \( FL = 24 \), \( HJ = 48 \).
   - Arc \( HP \) has a measure of 65 degrees.
   - \( HN = NJ = \frac{1}{2} HJ = 24 \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find the measure of arc \( HJ \), denoted as \( m \widehat{HJ} \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**:
   - The measure of an arc subtended by a chord can be related to the central angle subtending the arc.
   - Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \), the line \( MN \) is perpendicular to \( HJ \) and bisects the arc \( HJ \).
   - The measure of arc \( HP \) is given as 65 degrees. Since \( HP \) and \( PJ \) are parts of the arc \( HJ \), and \( N \) is the midpoint of chord \( HJ \), we can infer that the central angle \( \angle HMP \) is 65 degrees.

4. **Calculate the Measure of Arc \( HJ \)**:
   - The central angle \( \angle HMP \) is 65 degrees, which means arc \( HP \) is 65 degrees.
   - Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \), \( \angle HNJ = \angle NJH \).
   - The central angle \( \angle HMJ \) subtending the entire arc \( HJ \) is twice the angle \( \angle HMP \) because \( N \) bisects \( HJ \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle HMJ = 2 \times 65 = 130 \) degrees.

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated measure of arc \( HJ \) is 130 degrees.
   - Among the answer choices, 130 degrees corresponds to option C.

6. **Select the Closest Answer**:
   - The closest and exact match to our calculated result is option C.

</think>
Solution:
The measure of arc \( HJ \) is calculated to be 130 degrees based on the central angle subtended by the chord \( HJ \) and the given measure of arc \( HP \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
