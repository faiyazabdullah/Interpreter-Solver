1. **Analyze the Given Information**:
   - Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are defined.
   - Line segments are defined: BC, DE, and HA.
   - BC is parallel to DE.
   - Line HA intersects BC at point G and DE at point F.
   - Angles BGA and AFE are defined, with their measures given as 55 degrees and x degrees respectively.
   - It is stated that angle BGA is congruent to angle AFE.

2. **Summarize the Relevant Findings**:
   - From the congruence, MeasureOf(Angle(B,G,A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E)), hence 55 = x.
   - Since BC is parallel to DE and HA is a transversal, the angles BGA and AFE are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles formed by a transversal with two parallel lines are equal.

3. **Explore Geometric Theorems**:
   - Since corresponding angles are equal when a transversal crosses parallel lines, we can directly state that angle BGA equals angle AFE.

4. **Verify and Reassess**:
   - We have already confirmed from the problem statement that the angles are congruent, meaning their measures are equal.
   - With MeasureOf(Angle(B,G,A)) = 55, and the congruence of angles BGA and AFE, we conclude MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E)) = 55.

5. **Reflect and Backtrace**:
   - No additional assumptions or calculations are needed as the direct application of the corresponding angles postulate and the given congruence are sufficient.
   - Reassessing the conditions confirms that the value of x, which is MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E)), is indeed 55.

6. **Iterate for Final Confirmation**:
   - All steps have been verified, and all necessary conditions are satisfied.
   - The value of x directly matches one of the provided choices.

<Solution>

- Given the parallel lines and the transversal, and the congruence of angles BGA and AFE, the measure of angle AFE is equal to the measure of angle BGA.
- We have been given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,G,A)) = 55 degrees.
- Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E)) = 55 degrees.
- This matches choice A from the provided options.
