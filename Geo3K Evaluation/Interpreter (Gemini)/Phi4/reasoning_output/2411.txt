To solve the problem of finding the area of the shaded region, we need to carefully analyze the given geometric constraints and apply relevant formulas step by step.

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Circle(1) has a diameter of 20, which implies its radius is 10.
   - Circle(2) and Circle(3) are congruent with a radius of 5 each.
   - Circle(2) and Circle(3) are tangent to each other.
   - The shaded area is defined as the area of Circle(1) minus the sum of the areas of Circle(2) and Circle(3).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of the shaded region, which is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of Shape(4)} = \text{Area of Circle(1)} - (\text{Area of Circle(2)} + \text{Area of Circle(3)})
     \]

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Formulas:**
   - The area of a circle is given by the formula \( \pi r^2 \).

4. **Calculate Each Area:**
   - **Area of Circle(1):**
     \[
     \text{Area of Circle(1)} = \pi \times (10)^2 = 100\pi
     \]
   - **Area of Circle(2):**
     \[
     \text{Area of Circle(2)} = \pi \times (5)^2 = 25\pi
     \]
   - **Area of Circle(3):**
     \[
     \text{Area of Circle(3)} = \pi \times (5)^2 = 25\pi
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region:**
   - Substitute the calculated areas into the formula for the shaded area:
     \[
     \text{Area of Shape(4)} = 100\pi - (25\pi + 25\pi) = 100\pi - 50\pi = 50\pi
     \]

6. **Convert to Decimal and Round:**
   - Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), calculate:
     \[
     50\pi \approx 50 \times 3.14159 = 157.0795
     \]
   - Round 157.0795 to the nearest tenth, which is 157.1.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area of the shaded region is 157.1, which matches answer choice B.

8. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - Since the calculated area matches exactly with one of the answer choices, we select B.

Final Answer: B
