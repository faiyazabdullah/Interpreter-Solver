**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given two lines, \( l \) and \( m \), which are parallel.
- There are two angles, Angle(4) and Angle(5), with specific expressions for their measures:
  - MeasureOf(Angle(4)) = \( 2x + 23 \)
  - MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = \( 7x - 5 \)
- It is stated that the sum of the measures of Angle(4) and Angle(5) is 180 degrees, which suggests that these angles are supplementary. This makes sense if they are consecutive interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

- Since the angles are supplementary, we can write the equation:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(5))} = 180
  \]
- Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
  \[
  (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
  \]

**Step 3: Simplify and Solve the Equation**

- Combine like terms:
  \[
  2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180
  \]
  \[
  9x + 18 = 180
  \]
- Subtract 18 from both sides:
  \[
  9x = 162
  \]
- Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

- Substitute \( x = 18 \) back into the expressions for the angles to ensure they sum to 180:
  - MeasureOf(Angle(4)) = \( 2(18) + 23 = 36 + 23 = 59 \)
  - MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = \( 7(18) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121 \)
- Check the sum:
  \[
  59 + 121 = 180
  \]
- The calculations confirm that the angles are indeed supplementary.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( x \) is 18, which matches answer choice B.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and the geometric properties of parallel lines and supplementary angles.
- The closest and correct answer choice is B.

**Solution:**

1. Set up the equation based on the supplementary angle condition:
   \[
   (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
   \]
2. Simplify and solve:
   \[
   9x + 18 = 180
   \]
   \[
   9x = 162
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]
3. Verify by substituting \( x = 18 \) back into the angle expressions:
   - MeasureOf(Angle(4)) = 59
   - MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 121
   - Sum = 180
4. The calculated value of \( x \) is 18, which matches choice B.
