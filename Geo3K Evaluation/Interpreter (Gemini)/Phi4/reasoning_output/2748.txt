**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \).
- The sum of the measures of these angles is 180 degrees: \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = 180 \).
- We need to determine which condition is sufficient to prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \).

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We are looking for a condition that would make line \( d \) parallel to line \( XZ \). This involves understanding the properties of parallel lines and angles.
- Parallel lines have corresponding angles that are equal, alternate interior angles that are equal, or consecutive interior angles that are supplementary.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- **Corresponding Angles Postulate**: If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**: If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem**: If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of consecutive interior angles is supplementary.

**Step 4: Analyze Each Answer Choice**

- **A. \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)**: This suggests that two angles in the triangle are equal, which implies an isosceles triangle, but does not directly relate to parallel lines.
  
- **B. \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)**: If \( \angle 1 \) is congruent to \( \angle Z \), and \( \angle Z \) is an exterior angle, this could imply that line \( d \) is parallel to \( XZ \) by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem if \( \angle 1 \) is an interior angle on the opposite side of the transversal.

- **C. \( \angle 2 \cong \angle X \)**: This does not directly relate to any known parallel line theorem involving \( XZ \).

- **D. \( \angle 3 \cong \angle Z \)**: Similar to option B, if \( \angle 3 \) is congruent to \( \angle Z \), and \( \angle Z \) is an exterior angle, this could imply parallelism by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem if \( \angle 3 \) is an interior angle on the opposite side of the transversal.

**Step 5: Determine the Correct Answer**

- For line \( d \) to be parallel to \( XZ \), we need a condition that involves an angle relationship that can be interpreted as corresponding or alternate interior angles.
- Option B (\( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)) suggests that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle Z \) are alternate interior angles, which would imply parallelism if \( \angle 1 \) is on the opposite side of the transversal from \( \angle Z \).

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- Option B is the most direct application of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, which is a standard method to prove parallel lines.

</think>

**Solution:**

To prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \), we need a condition that establishes a relationship between angles that can be interpreted as corresponding or alternate interior angles. Option B (\( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)) satisfies the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, which is a valid method to prove that two lines are parallel when a transversal intersects them. Therefore, the correct choice is:

Final Answer: B
