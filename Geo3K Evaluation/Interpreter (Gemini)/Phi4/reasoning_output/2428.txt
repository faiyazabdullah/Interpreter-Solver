<think>
1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given a regular hexagon \( JKLMNP \) inscribed in a circle \( R \).
   - A regular polygon means all sides and angles are equal.
   - The hexagon is inscribed in the circle, meaning all vertices of the hexagon lie on the circle.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of a central angle of the hexagon inscribed in the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - A central angle is an angle whose vertex is the center of the circle and whose sides pass through two points on the circle.
   - The circle's total measure is \( 360^\circ \).
   - The regular hexagon divides the circle into 6 equal arcs because it is regular and inscribed.

4. **Calculate the Measure of a Central Angle:**
   - Since the hexagon divides the circle into 6 equal parts, each central angle corresponds to one of these parts.
   - To find the measure of one central angle, divide the total circle measure by the number of equal parts:
     \[
     \text{Measure of a central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
     \]

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of the central angle is \( 60^\circ \).
   - Among the given answer choices, \( 60^\circ \) corresponds to option B.

6. **Verify and Confirm:**
   - Double-check the division and understanding that a regular hexagon divides the circle into 6 equal parts, each central angle being \( 60^\circ \).

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since the calculated answer \( 60^\circ \) matches exactly with one of the choices, choose option B.

</think>

**Solution:**
To find the measure of a central angle of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, divide the total circle measure \( 360^\circ \) by the number of equal parts (6), resulting in \( 60^\circ \). This matches with option B.

Final Answer: B
