1. **Analyzing the Problem**: We have an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot U\). This means all sides of the pentagon are equal, and each vertex lies on the circle. The task is to find the measure of \(\angle PSR\).

2. **Summarizing Key Points**:
   - The pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in a circle.
   - The central angles subtended by each side of the pentagon are equal because the pentagon is equilateral.
   - The total angle around the center of the circle is \(360^\circ\).

3. **Exploration**:
   - Since the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed, each central angle \(\angle POQ\), \(\angle QOR\), \(\angle ROS\), \(\angle SOT\), and \(\angle TOP\) is equal.
   - The sum of these central angles is \(360^\circ\). Therefore, each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

4. **Finding \(\angle PSR\)**:
   - \(\angle PSR\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \(PR\).
   - The arc \(PR\) is composed of two central angles: \(\angle POR\) and \(\angle QOR\).
   - Each of these central angles is \(72^\circ\), so the arc \(PR\) is \(72^\circ + 72^\circ = 144^\circ\).

5. **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   - The inscribed angle \(\angle PSR\) is half of the arc it subtends.
   - Therefore, \(\angle PSR = \frac{144^\circ}{2} = 72^\circ\).

6. **Verification**:
   - The calculation aligns with the properties of inscribed angles and central angles in a circle.
   - The steps logically follow from the given conditions and geometric theorems.

7. **Reassessment**:
   - Re-evaluate each step to ensure no errors in reasoning or calculation.
   - Confirm that the use of the inscribed angle theorem is appropriate for this scenario.

8. **Reflection and Conclusion**:
   - The calculated measure of \(\angle PSR\) is \(72^\circ\).
   - This matches one of the given answer choices.

</think> 
"Solution section": The measure of \(\angle PSR\) is calculated using the properties of inscribed and central angles in a circle. Each central angle in the equilateral pentagon is \(72^\circ\), and the arc subtended by \(\angle PSR\) is \(144^\circ\). Thus, \(\angle PSR\) is half of this arc, resulting in \(72^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
