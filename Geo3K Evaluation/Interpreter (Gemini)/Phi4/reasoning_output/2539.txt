**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a circle \( \odot M \) with several points \( F, K, G, H, P, J, L, N \) lying on it.
- Lines \( FG, KL, HJ, KP \) are chords of the circle.
- Points \( L \) and \( N \) are midpoints of chords \( FG \) and \( HJ \) respectively.
- The lengths of \( FG \) and \( HJ \) are given as 24 and 48, respectively.
- \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FG \), so \( FL = LG = 12 \).
- \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \), so \( HN = NJ = 24 \).
- The measure of arc \( HP \) is given as 65 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of arc \( PJ \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of arc \( PJ \) in the circle \( \odot M \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that intercepts the arc.
- The entire circle is 360 degrees, so the sum of the measures of arcs \( HP \) and \( PJ \) must equal the measure of the arc \( HJ \) plus any arcs between \( P \) and \( J \) on the circle.
- Since \( HJ \) is a chord, the arc \( HJ \) is intercepted by the central angle \( \angle HJ \).
- The measure of arc \( HJ \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle HPJ \) because \( \angle HPJ \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( HJ \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( HJ \)**

- Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \), \( HN = NJ = 24 \).
- The length of \( HJ \) is 48, which is a chord of the circle.
- The measure of arc \( HJ \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle HPJ \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( PJ \)**

- The measure of arc \( HP \) is given as 65 degrees.
- The measure of arc \( HJ \) can be calculated using the fact that \( HJ \) is a chord and \( N \) is its midpoint.
- Since \( HN = NJ = 24 \), and \( HJ = 48 \), the arc \( HJ \) is twice the inscribed angle \( \angle HPJ \).
- The measure of arc \( HJ \) is \( 2 \times \angle HPJ \).
- Since \( \angle HPJ \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( HJ \), and \( HP \) is part of this arc, we have:
  \[
  \text{Arc } HJ = 2 \times 65 = 130 \text{ degrees}
  \]
- Now, \( \text{Arc } HJ = \text{Arc } HP + \text{Arc } PJ \).
- Therefore, \( 130 = 65 + \text{Arc } PJ \).
- Solving for \( \text{Arc } PJ \), we get:
  \[
  \text{Arc } PJ = 130 - 65 = 65 \text{ degrees}
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of arc \( PJ \) is 65 degrees.
- This matches answer choice B.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated answer is exactly 65 degrees, which matches choice B.

**Step 8: Final Answer**

- Final Answer: B

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the given constraints:
   - \( FL = LG = 12 \) because \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FG \).
   - \( HN = NJ = 24 \) because \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \).
   - Measure of arc \( HP = 65^\circ \).

2. Calculate the measure of arc \( HJ \):
   - Since \( HJ \) is a chord and \( N \) is its midpoint, the measure of arc \( HJ \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle HPJ \).
   - Measure of arc \( HJ = 2 \times 65 = 130^\circ \).

3. Calculate the measure of arc \( PJ \):
   - \( \text{Arc } HJ = \text{Arc } HP + \text{Arc } PJ \).
   - \( 130 = 65 + \text{Arc } PJ \).
   - \( \text{Arc } PJ = 130 - 65 = 65^\circ \).

4. Compare with answer choices:
   - The calculated measure of arc \( PJ \) is 65 degrees, which matches choice B.
