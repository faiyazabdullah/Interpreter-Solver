1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle with center \( D \).
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circle, forming a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - Line segments \( AB \) and \( BC \) are chords of the circle.
   - We are given that the measure of arc \( AC \) is 122 degrees.
   - The angle \( \angle ABC \) is given as half the measure of arc \( AC \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle ABC \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Therefore, \( \angle ABC \) is half of the measure of arc \( AC \).

4. **Perform Calculations:**
   - Given: Measure of arc \( AC = 122^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 122^\circ = 61^\circ \).

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 61^\circ \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 29
     - B. 58
     - C. 61
     - D. 122

6. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated measure \( 61^\circ \) matches exactly with option C.

7. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - The calculations align with the geometric properties and the given information.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

</think>

**Solution:**
- The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is calculated as \( 61^\circ \) using the property that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
- This matches option C.
