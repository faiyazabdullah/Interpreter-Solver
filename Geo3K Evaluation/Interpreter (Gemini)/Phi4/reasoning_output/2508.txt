**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) which is specified to be equilateral. This means all sides are equal and all angles are \( 60^\circ \).
- We are given the following conditions related to the lengths of sides \( AB \) and \( AC \):
  - \( \text{Length of } AB = 2x + 11 \)
  - \( \text{Length of } AC = 6x - 9 \)
- The problem also states \( \text{Length of } AB = \text{Length of } AC \), which is a property of equilateral triangles.

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, \( AB = AC \). Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for the lengths:

\[ 2x + 11 = 6x - 9 \]

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**

To find \( x \), solve the equation:

1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   11 = 4x - 9
   \]

2. Add 9 to both sides:
   \[
   20 = 4x
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 4: Verification**

- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for the lengths to verify:
  - \( AB = 2(5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21 \)
  - \( AC = 6(5) - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21 \)

Both lengths are equal, confirming that the solution satisfies the condition \( AB = AC \).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( x \) is 5, which matches option B.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and constraints.
- The answer choice that matches the calculated \( x \) is B.

**Solution:**

By solving the equation \( 2x + 11 = 6x - 9 \), we find \( x = 5 \). This value satisfies all given conditions of the equilateral triangle and the length equations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
