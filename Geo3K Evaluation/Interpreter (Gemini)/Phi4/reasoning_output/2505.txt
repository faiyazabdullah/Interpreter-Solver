### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are provided with specific lengths:
- \(AC = 14\)
- \(BD = 24\)

Additionally, it is given that \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular to each other, which is a property of the diagonals of a rhombus.

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the area of the rhombus \(ABCD\).

### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Formulas
The area \(A\) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving its diagonals:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### Step 4: Perform Calculations
Substitute the given lengths of the diagonals into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \times 24
\]

Calculate the product:
\[
14 \times 24 = 336
\]

Now, calculate the area:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 336 = 168
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Given Answer Choices
The calculated area is 168. Let's compare this with the provided answer choices:
- A. 38
- B. 84
- C. 168
- D. 336

The calculated area matches choice C.

### Step 6: Verify and Conclude
The calculations have been verified, and the result matches one of the provided options. Therefore, the final answer is choice C.

**Solution:**

1. Identify the formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals: \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\).
2. Substitute the given diagonal lengths into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \times 24 = \frac{1}{2} \times 336 = 168
   \]
3. Compare the calculated area with the answer choices and select the correct one.
