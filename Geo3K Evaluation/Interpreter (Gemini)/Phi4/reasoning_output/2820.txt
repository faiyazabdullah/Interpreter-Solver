**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We have a circle with center at point A.
- Point B lies on the circumference of this circle.
- The line segment AB is a radius of the circle.
- The length of AB is given as 4.
- We need to find the area of the circle.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- The radius of the circle is 4.
- The formula for the area of a circle is \( \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Formula**
- Substitute the radius into the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Value**
- Use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \).
- Calculate \( 16 \times 3.14159 \).

**Step 5: Perform the Calculation**
- \( 16 \times 3.14159 = 50.26544 \).

**Step 6: Round to the Nearest Tenth**
- The value 50.26544 rounded to the nearest tenth is 50.3.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated area is 50.3.
- The closest answer choice to 50.3 is 50.2.

**Step 8: Verify and Conclude**
- Reassess calculations to ensure no errors.
- Confirm that rounding and comparison with choices are correct.

**Solution:**

Given the radius of the circle is 4, the area of the circle is calculated using the formula \( \pi r^2 \). Substituting the radius, we have:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we calculate:

\[
16 \times 3.14159 = 50.26544
\]

Rounding 50.26544 to the nearest tenth gives 50.3. Comparing this with the answer choices, the closest value is 50.2.
