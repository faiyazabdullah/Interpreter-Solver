**Step 1: Analyze Given Geometric Constraints**

We have several points, lines, angles, and shapes described:
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AB, BC, DE, AE, AD, BE
- Angles involving various points, with measures provided.

Additionally, we have:
- Quadrilateral ABED
- Triangle BEC
- Point E lies on line DC
- Measures of several angles given.

**Step 2: Identify Relationships and Properties**

We need to find which segments are parallel. Parallel lines have equal corresponding angles when intersected by a transversal. Also, parallel lines maintain consistent angle relationships.

Given angles:
- ∠DAE = 80°
- ∠ADE = 60°
- ∠DEA = 40°
- ∠ABE = 30°
- ∠EBC = 40°
- ∠BEC = 80°
- ∠ECB = 60°
- ∠ABC = 70°

**Step 3: Explore Triangle and Quadrilateral Properties**

- **Quadrilateral ABED:**
  - The sum of interior angles = 360°
  - We know ∠DAE = 80°, ∠ADE = 60°, and ∠ABE = 30°. We can find ∠BED:
    \[
    \text{Sum of known angles} = 80° + 60° + 30° = 170°
    \]
    \[
    \text{Therefore, } \angle BED = 360° - 170° = 190°
    \]
    However, this doesn't fit a simple quadrilateral, suggesting a complex configuration or error in assumptions.

- **Triangle BEC:**
  - The sum of interior angles = 180°
  - Given: ∠EBC = 40°, ∠BEC = 80°, ∠ECB = 60°
  - These add up correctly: 40° + 80° + 60° = 180°

**Step 4: Use Angle Measures to Determine Parallel Lines**

- **Check for Parallel Lines:**
  - **Lines AD and BC:**
    - ∠ADE = 60° and ∠EBC = 40°. No corresponding angle relationship.
    - ∠DAE = 80° and ∠ABC = 70°. No corresponding angle relationship.

  - **Lines AD and BE:**
    - ∠ADE = 60° and ∠BEC = 80°. No corresponding angle relationship.
    - ∠DAE = 80° and ∠ABE = 30°. No corresponding angle relationship.

  - **Lines AE and BC:**
    - ∠DAE = 80° and ∠ABC = 70°. No corresponding angle relationship.
    - ∠ADE = 60° and ∠EBC = 40°. No corresponding angle relationship.

  - **Lines AB and CD:**
    - No direct angles given for CD, but E lies on DC.
    - Consider ∠ABE = 30° and ∠EBC = 40°. If AE is a transversal, then ∠ABE and ∠EBC should be supplementary if AB is parallel to CD.
    - 30° + 40° = 70°, not supplementary.

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

Given the angle measures and relationships:
- ∠DAE = 80° and ∠EBC = 40°. If AD is a transversal, then ∠ADE and ∠BEC should be equal for parallelism.
- ∠ADE = 60° and ∠BEC = 80°. These are not equal, but consider alternate interior angles:
  - ∠ADE = 60° and ∠BEC = 80°. If AD is a transversal, then ∠ADE and ∠BEC should be equal for parallelism.
  - However, ∠DAE = 80° and ∠BEC = 80° are equal, suggesting AD || BC.

**Step 6: Final Verification**

- **Conclusion:**
  - The only consistent parallel relationship based on alternate interior angles is AD || BC.

</think>

<Solution>

Based on the analysis of the given angles and their relationships, the segments that are parallel are AD and BC. This conclusion is drawn from the equality of alternate interior angles when AD is considered a transversal.

Final Answer: B. A D and B C
