1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle with center O.
   - Points A, B, C, D, and E are on or inside the circle.
   - Line segments CD and BE are chords of the circle, and they intersect at point A.
   - The lengths of certain segments are given: DA = 5, AB = x, AE = 4, AC = x + 8.
   - The product of the lengths of segments DA and AB equals the product of the lengths of segments AC and AE.

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of x.

3. **Applying Relevant Theorems:**
   - The Power of a Point theorem states that for two intersecting chords, the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. Therefore, DA * AB = AC * AE.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - From the Power of a Point theorem: \( DA \cdot AB = AC \cdot AE \).
   - Substitute the given lengths: \( 5 \cdot x = (x + 8) \cdot 4 \).

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Expand and simplify the equation: 
     \[
     5x = 4(x + 8)
     \]
     \[
     5x = 4x + 32
     \]
   - Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
     \[
     x = 32
     \]

6. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - Check if \( x = 32 \) fits the context of the problem.
   - The calculated value of \( x = 32 \) is significantly larger than any of the answer choices.
   - Reassess the setup and calculations for any errors.

7. **Re-evaluation:**
   - Re-examine the equation setup: \( 5x = 4(x + 8) \).
   - Recalculate:
     \[
     5x = 4x + 32
     \]
     \[
     x = 32
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, but the result does not match any answer choices, indicating a potential misinterpretation or oversight.

8. **Considering Closest Value:**
   - Given the options A: 2, B: 4, C: 5, D: 9, the closest value to 32 is not applicable.
   - Reassess the context: The setup might imply a different interpretation or simplification.

9. **Revisiting the Equation:**
   - Re-evaluate the equation: \( 5x = 4(x + 8) \).
   - Simplify again:
     \[
     5x = 4x + 32
     \]
     \[
     x = 32
     \]
   - Consider if there was a misinterpretation in the problem setup or if additional constraints should be applied.

10. **Final Decision:**
    - Given the discrepancy, select the closest logical value from the choices.
    - Re-evaluate the context: If the setup is correct, the closest reasonable choice is D: 9, as it is the largest and closest to the calculated value.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the Power of a Point theorem and the given constraints, the equation \( 5x = 4(x + 8) \) simplifies to \( x = 32 \). However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices. Upon re-evaluation and considering the context, the closest reasonable choice is D: 9. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D
</Solution>
