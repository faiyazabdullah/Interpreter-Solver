**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given points A, B, D, and Q.
- Two lines are repeated in the constraints: Line(Q, B) and Line(D, B).
- We have two triangles: Triangle(Q, D, B) and Triangle(Q, A, B).
- The triangles are similar: Similar(Triangle(Q, D, B), Triangle(Q, A, B)).
- The line Line(A, B) is parallel to Line(D, B).
- There is a discrepancy in the given lengths: Line(Q, B) is stated to be both 6 and 8 units long, which needs clarification. We can assume this is a typo and consider one of them to be correct.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since triangles QDB and QAB are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional.
- Parallel lines suggest that angles between these lines and a transversal are equal, reinforcing the similarity.
- The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is constant. We need to find the scale factor from B to B'.

**Step 3: Explore the Ratios and Proportions**
- The similarity of triangles gives us:
  \[
  \frac{QD}{QA} = \frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{QB}{QB'}
  \]
- We need to find the scale factor from B to B', which is \(\frac{QB'}{QB}\).

**Step 4: Resolve the Length Discrepancy**
- Assume \(QB = 6\) (as a starting point, since both 6 and 8 are given, and we need a consistent value).
- The ratio \(\frac{LengthOf(Line(Q,B))}{LengthOf(Line(Q,B))}\) is 1, which doesn't help directly but confirms the need for a consistent length.

**Step 5: Apply the Similarity Condition**
- Since \(\frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{QB}{QB'}\), and Line(A, B) is parallel to Line(D, B), the triangles are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity.
- Given the parallel lines and the similarity, the scale factor between corresponding sides of the triangles is the same.

**Step 6: Calculate the Scale Factor**
- If we assume \(QB = 6\), then we need to find \(QB'\) such that the triangles remain similar.
- Given the answer choices, we test each:
  - \( \frac{3}{4} \), \( \frac{5}{6} \), \( \frac{6}{5} \), \( \frac{4}{3} \).

**Step 7: Verify Each Option**
- For \( \frac{3}{4} \), \( QB' = \frac{3}{4} \times 6 = 4.5 \).
- For \( \frac{5}{6} \), \( QB' = \frac{5}{6} \times 6 = 5 \).
- For \( \frac{6}{5} \), \( QB' = \frac{6}{5} \times 6 = 7.2 \).
- For \( \frac{4}{3} \), \( QB' = \frac{4}{3} \times 6 = 8 \).

**Step 8: Reassess and Reflect**
- The only consistent length that fits the given constraints (assuming \(QB = 6\) and \(QB' = 8\) due to the typo) is when the scale factor is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

**Step 9: Finalize the Solution**
- The scale factor from B to B' is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the similarity of triangles, the scale factor from B to B' is determined by the ratio of corresponding sides. Assuming \(QB = 6\) and resolving the discrepancy by considering \(QB' = 8\) (as a plausible correction), the scale factor is:

\[
\frac{QB'}{QB} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
