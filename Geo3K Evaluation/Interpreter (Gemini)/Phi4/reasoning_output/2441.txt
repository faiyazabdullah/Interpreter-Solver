1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given the measures of specific angles and relationships between angles.
   - \( m \angle 3 = 110^\circ \)
   - \( m \angle 12 = 55^\circ \)
   - \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 1 \text{ and } m \angle 2 = 180^\circ \) (indicating they are supplementary, possibly forming a linear pair).
   - \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 12 \text{ and } m \angle 16 = 180^\circ \) (indicating these are supplementary, possibly forming a linear pair).
   - \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 7 \)
   - \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 7 \text{ and } m \angle 8 = 180^\circ \) (indicating they are supplementary, possibly forming a linear pair).
   - \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 3 \text{ and } m \angle 4 = 180^\circ \) (indicating they are supplementary, possibly forming a linear pair).

2. **Determine What We Need to Find:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - From \( m \angle 12 = 55^\circ \) and \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 12 + m \angle 16 = 180^\circ \), we can find:
     \[
     m \angle 16 = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
     \]
   - From \( m \angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 7 \), we have:
     \[
     m \angle 7 = 110^\circ
     \]
   - From \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 7 + m \angle 8 = 180^\circ \), we find:
     \[
     m \angle 8 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]
   - From \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ \), we find:
     \[
     m \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]

4. **Identify Relationships:**
   - We know \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180^\circ \).
   - We need additional information to find \( m \angle 1 \).

5. **Explore Additional Angle Relationships:**
   - Consider \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) as part of a linear pair or supplementary angles.
   - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary, and \( \angle 7 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are supplementary.
   - Since \( m \angle 3 = m \angle 7 = 110^\circ \), and \( m \angle 4 = m \angle 8 = 70^\circ \), these angles form a consistent pattern of supplementary pairs.

6. **Reassess the Given Information:**
   - \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 16 \) are supplementary, and \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary.
   - We have established that \( m \angle 16 = 125^\circ \).

7. **Reflect on the Supplementary Angles:**
   - Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are supplementary, and \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 16 \) are supplementary, we can infer:
   - If \( \angle 12 \) is part of a linear pair with \( \angle 1 \) or another angle, then:
     \[
     m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - m \angle 12 = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
     \]

8. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - The calculations align with the given constraints and relationships.
   - The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 125^\circ \).

9. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 125^\circ \), which corresponds to choice C.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 125^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
