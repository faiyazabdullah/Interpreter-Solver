1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have several points and lines, some of which are parallel to each other:
     - \( \text{Line } (O, L) \parallel \text{Line } (F, C) \)
     - \( \text{Line } (F, C) \parallel \text{Line } (M, N) \)
     - \( \text{Line } (D, I) \parallel \text{Line } (G, B, K) \)
   - We are given specific angle measures:
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (O, B, H) = 2x + 3 \)
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (M, A, E) = 6 - x \)
   - We know that \( \text{Line } (B, H) \cong \text{Line } (A, E) \).
   - The angles \( \angle (O, B, H) \) and \( \angle (M, A, E) \) are congruent: \( \text{Measure of } \angle (O, B, H) = \text{Measure of } \angle (M, A, E) \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) given the congruence of the angles \( \angle (O, B, H) \) and \( \angle (M, A, E) \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( \angle (O, B, H) \) and \( \angle (M, A, E) \) are congruent, their measures are equal:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 6 - x
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 = 6 - x
     \]
     Add \( x \) to both sides:
     \[
     3x + 3 = 6
     \]
     Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     3x = 3
     \]
     Divide by 3:
     \[
     x = 1
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into the expressions for the angles to verify:
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (O, B, H) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \)
     - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (M, A, E) = 6 - 1 = 5 \)
   - Both measures are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **Compare with the Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 1, which corresponds to choice A.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since the calculated value matches exactly with one of the choices, select A.

8. **Final Verification:**
   - All steps and calculations align correctly with the problem constraints and solution process.
</think>

**Solution:**
1. Set up the equation based on the given congruence of angles:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 6 - x
   \]
2. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   - Add \( x \) to both sides: \( 3x + 3 = 6 \)
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( 3x = 3 \)
   - Divide by 3: \( x = 1 \)
3. Verify the solution:
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) into both angle expressions to ensure they are equal.
   - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (O, B, H) = 5 \)
   - \( \text{Measure of } \angle (M, A, E) = 5 \)
   - Both angles are congruent, confirming the solution.
