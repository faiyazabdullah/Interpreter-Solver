1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a quadrilateral \(PQRS\) that is both a rhombus and inscribed in a circle.
   - Since it is inscribed in a circle, \(PQRS\) must be a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - A rhombus with all sides equal and inscribed in a circle is a special case that forms a square. This is because a rhombus inscribed in a circle must have all its angles as right angles (90 degrees) to satisfy the properties of both shapes.

2. **Understanding the Implications:**
   - Since \(PQRS\) is a square, all its internal angles are right angles, i.e., \(90^\circ\).
   - In a square, the diagonals bisect each other at \(90^\circ\) and are equal in length.
   - The diagonals of the square also serve as diameters of the circumscribed circle.

3. **Focus on the Arc \(SP\):**
   - The arc \(SP\) is subtended by the angle \(\angle QPS\).
   - Since \(\angle QPS\) is a right angle (90 degrees) in the square, the arc \(SP\) is a semicircle.
   - The measure of a semicircular arc in a circle is \(180^\circ\).

4. **Determine the Measure of \(\widehat{SP}\):**
   - The arc \(SP\) is subtended by the central angle \(\angle SOC\) where \(O\) is the center of the circle.
   - Since \(SP\) is a semicircle, \(\angle SOC = 180^\circ\).
   - However, the question asks for the measure of the inscribed angle \(\widehat{SP}\), which is half of the central angle subtending the same arc.
   - Therefore, \(\widehat{SP} = \frac{180^\circ}{2} = 90^\circ\).

5. **Verify with Given Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \(\widehat{SP}\) is \(90^\circ\).
   - Among the answer choices, \(90^\circ\) corresponds to option D.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \(\widehat{SP}\) is \(90^\circ\), matching option D.
</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, since \(PQRS\) is a square inscribed in a circle, the arc \(SP\) is a semicircle, and the inscribed angle \(\widehat{SP}\) is half of the semicircular arc, which is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
