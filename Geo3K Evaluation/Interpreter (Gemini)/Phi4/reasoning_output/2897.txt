**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given a parallelogram JKLM with specific angle measures:
  - Measure of ∠J = 75°
  - Measure of ∠M = 105°
  - Measure of ∠L = (2x - 1)°
  - Measure of ∠J = Measure of ∠L (from the constraint)
  - Measure of ∠M = Measure of ∠K (from the property of parallelograms)
- We have additional constraints:
  - Sum of ∠J and ∠M is 180°
  - Sum of ∠L and ∠M is 180°
  - Sum of ∠K and ∠J is 180°
  - Sum of ∠K and ∠L is 180°

**Step 2: Use Parallelogram Properties**
- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles sum to 180°.
- Therefore:
  - ∠J = ∠L
  - ∠K = ∠M
  - ∠J + ∠M = 180°
  - ∠K + ∠L = 180°

**Step 3: Solve for x Using Given Constraints**
- Since ∠J = ∠L, we have:
  \[
  75 = 2x - 1
  \]
  Solving for x:
  \[
  75 + 1 = 2x \\
  76 = 2x \\
  x = \frac{76}{2} \\
  x = 38
  \]

**Step 4: Verify Consistency with Other Constraints**
- Check if the calculated x satisfies all constraints:
  - ∠L = 2x - 1 = 2(38) - 1 = 76 - 1 = 75°, which matches ∠J.
  - ∠M = 105°, and ∠K = ∠M = 105°.
  - Check sums:
    - ∠J + ∠M = 75 + 105 = 180° (satisfied)
    - ∠L + ∠M = 75 + 105 = 180° (satisfied)
    - ∠K + ∠J = 105 + 75 = 180° (satisfied)
    - ∠K + ∠L = 105 + 75 = 180° (satisfied)

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of x is 38, which matches option A.

**Step 6: Final Verification**
- All constraints and properties of the parallelogram are satisfied with x = 38.
- The solution is consistent with all given conditions.

</think>

**Solution:**
- The value of x that satisfies all the given conditions in the parallelogram is 38.
- Therefore, the correct answer choice is A.
