**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).
- Points \( A \) and \( D \) lie on line \( l \), and points \( C \) and \( H \) lie on line \( m \).
- \( \angle DAB = 38^\circ \) and \( \angle BCH = 33^\circ \).
- Lines \( AB \) and \( BC \) intersect these parallel lines.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Since lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel and \( AB \) and \( BC \) intersect them, we can use the concept of alternate interior angles and corresponding angles.
- \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are alternate interior angles with respect to lines \( l \) and \( m \) and transversal \( AB \).
- Therefore, \( \angle ABC = \angle DAB = 38^\circ \).

**Step 4: Verify Calculations and Considerations**

- Check if there are any additional relationships or angles that need to be considered.
- Since \( \angle BCH = 33^\circ \) is given, it might be tempting to consider it, but it is not directly related to \( \angle ABC \) as it is on the opposite side of the transversal \( BC \).

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 38^\circ \).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 33, B. 38, C. 61, D. 71.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated measure \( 38^\circ \) matches option B.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 38^\circ \).

**Step 8: Conclude with the Final Answer**

- The correct choice is B.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \), and the transversal \( AB \), the angle \( \angle DAB = 38^\circ \) is an alternate interior angle to \( \angle ABC \). Therefore, by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, \( \angle ABC = 38^\circ \).

Comparing this with the answer choices, the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is exactly \( 38^\circ \), which corresponds to option B.

Final Answer: B.
