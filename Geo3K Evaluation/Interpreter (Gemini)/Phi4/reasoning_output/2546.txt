**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We have a circle with center \(X\).
- There are points \(X\), \(Y\), and \(W\) such that \(XY\) and \(XW\) are radii of the circle.
- The lengths of \(XY\) and \(XW\) are given as 2 units each, indicating the radius of the circle is 2.
- There is a sector \(XYW\) which is shaded and green, and we need to find the area of this shaded sector.

**Step 2: Identify the Required Information**
- We need to determine the area of the sector \(XYW\).
- The formula for the area of a sector is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2\), where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius.

**Step 3: Determine the Central Angle \(\theta\)**
- Since \(XY\) and \(XW\) are radii, \(\triangle XYW\) is an isosceles triangle with \(XY = XW = 2\).
- If we assume \(\angle YXW\) is \(\theta\), we need to find \(\theta\).
- Without loss of generality, if \(\angle YXW\) is a right angle (90 degrees), then \(\triangle XYW\) would be a right isosceles triangle. However, this is not specified, so we need to explore further.

**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Sector**
- Assume \(\angle YXW = 60^\circ\) (a common angle for equilateral triangles, which would make \(\triangle XYW\) equilateral if possible).
- The area of the sector is then \(\frac{60}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times \pi \times 4 = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

**Step 5: Calculate the Area Numerically**
- Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), the area becomes \(\frac{2 \times 3.14}{3} \approx 2.0933\).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated area is approximately 2.1.
- The closest answer choice to 2.1 is 1.8.

**Step 7: Verification and Reflection**
- Reassess the assumption of \(\theta = 60^\circ\). If \(\theta\) were 90 degrees, the area would be \(\frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times 4 = \pi\), which is approximately 3.14, not close to any answer choice.
- If \(\theta\) were 45 degrees, the area would be \(\frac{45}{360} \times \pi \times 4 = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57\), closer to 1.8.
- Given the constraints and typical angle choices, 60 degrees is a reasonable assumption for simplicity and common geometric problems.

**Step 8: Final Decision**
- Based on the calculations and comparisons, the closest answer to our calculated area of approximately 2.1 is 1.8.

**Solution:**

To find the area of the shaded sector \(XYW\), we used the formula for the area of a sector \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2\). Assuming \(\theta = 60^\circ\) for simplicity and common geometric configurations, we calculated the area as approximately 2.1. The closest answer choice to this value is 1.8.
