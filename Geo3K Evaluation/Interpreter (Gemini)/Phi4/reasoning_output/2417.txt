**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a circle \(\odot P\) with center \(P\) and radius 2 inches.
- Points \(Q\), \(R\), \(S\), and \(T\) lie on the circle.
- The lines \(PQ\), \(PR\), \(PS\), and \(PT\) are radii of the circle, each with a length of 2 inches.
- We are given the measures of angles \(\angle QPR = 112^\circ\) and \(\angle RPS = 130^\circ\).
- We need to find the length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\).

**Step 2: Understand the Objective**

- The length of an arc in a circle is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
  \]
  where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees, and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

**Step 3: Calculate the Central Angle \(\angle RPS\)**

- The central angle \(\angle RPS\) is given as \(130^\circ\).

**Step 4: Calculate the Arc Length \(\widehat{RS}\)**

- Using the formula for arc length:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length of } \widehat{RS} = \frac{130^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 2
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  = \frac{130}{360} \times 4\pi
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{13}{36} \times 4\pi
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{52\pi}{36}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{13\pi}{9}
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value**

- Use \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
  \[
  \frac{13\pi}{9} \approx \frac{13 \times 3.14159}{9}
  \]
  \[
  \approx \frac{40.84067}{9}
  \]
  \[
  \approx 4.53896
  \]

**Step 6: Round to the Nearest Hundredth**

- The calculated arc length is approximately \(4.54\).

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to \(4.54\) is \(4.54\), which corresponds to option C.

**Step 8: Final Verification**

- Reassess all calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Confirm that the rounding and arithmetic are correct.
- Verify that the chosen answer is the closest to the calculated value.

</think>

**Solution:**

To find the length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\), we used the formula for arc length with the given central angle \(\angle RPS = 130^\circ\) and radius \(r = 2\) inches. The calculations led to an arc length of approximately \(4.54\) inches. Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest match is option C.

Final Answer: C
