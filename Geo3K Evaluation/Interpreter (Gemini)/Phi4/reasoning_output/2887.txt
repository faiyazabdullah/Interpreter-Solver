1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - Points \( J, K, M, G \) lie on circle \( \odot F \).
   - Line segments \( FH \) and \( FL \) are congruent and both are perpendicular to lines \( HG \) and \( KM \) respectively.
   - \( FK = 17 \) and is a radius of the circle.
   - \( H \) is the midpoint of \( JG \) and \( L \) is the midpoint of \( KM \).
   - \( HL = 8 \) and \( F \) is the midpoint of \( HL \).

2. **Identify the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of \( JG \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( FH \cong FL \), and both are radii of the circle, \( FH = FL = FK = 17 \).
   - \( F \) is the midpoint of \( HL \), so \( FH = FL = \frac{HL}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
   - However, since \( FH = 17 \), there seems to be a misunderstanding. \( FH \) and \( FL \) are not half of \( HL \); rather, \( HL \) is a chord of the circle.
   - \( H \) is the midpoint of \( JG \), so \( JG = 2 \times HJ \).
   - \( L \) is the midpoint of \( KM \), so \( KM = 2 \times KL \).

4. **Calculate \( JG \):**
   - Since \( F \) is the midpoint of \( HL \) and \( FH = 17 \), \( FL = 17 \).
   - \( HL = 8 \), and since \( F \) is the midpoint, \( HF = FL = 4 \).
   - By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle FHG \) (right triangle), where \( FG \) is the hypotenuse:
     \[
     FG^2 = FH^2 + HG^2 = 17^2 + HG^2
     \]
   - Since \( H \) is the midpoint of \( JG \), \( HJ = \frac{JG}{2} \).
   - \( HG = HJ \) because \( H \) is the midpoint of \( JG \).
   - Substitute \( HG = HJ \) into the equation:
     \[
     FG^2 = 17^2 + HJ^2
     \]
   - Since \( FG \) is also a radius, \( FG = 17 \):
     \[
     17^2 = 17^2 + HJ^2 \implies HJ^2 = 0 \implies HJ = 0
     \]
   - This implies \( HG = 0 \), which is incorrect. Reassess:
   - Use \( HL = 8 \) and \( F \) as midpoint:
     \[
     HF = FL = 4
     \]
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle FHG \):
     \[
     FG^2 = FH^2 + HG^2 = 17^2 + HG^2
     \]
   - Since \( FG = 17 \), solve for \( HG \):
     \[
     17^2 = 17^2 + HG^2 \implies HG^2 = 0 \implies HG = 0
     \]
   - Correct approach:
     - \( H \) is midpoint of \( JG \), so \( JG = 2 \times HG \).
     - \( HL = 8 \), and \( F \) is midpoint, so \( HF = FL = 4 \).
     - Use \( \triangle FHG \) again:
       \[
       FG^2 = FH^2 + HG^2 = 17^2 + HG^2
       \]
     - \( FG = 17 \), solve for \( HG \):
       \[
       17^2 = 17^2 + HG^2 \implies HG^2 = 0 \implies HG = 0
       \]
     - Reassess:
       - \( H \) is midpoint of \( JG \), \( JG = 2 \times HG \).
       - Use \( \triangle FHG \) with \( FH = 17 \), \( FG = 17 \):
         \[
         HG^2 = FG^2 - FH^2 = 17^2 - 17^2 = 0
         \]
       - Correct \( HG \) using \( HL = 8 \), \( F \) midpoint:
         \[
         HL = 8, \quad HF = FL = 4
         \]
       - \( HG = \sqrt{FG^2 - FH^2} = \sqrt{17^2 - 4^2} = \sqrt{289 - 16} = \sqrt{273}
         \]
       - \( JG = 2 \times HG = 2 \times \sqrt{273} \approx 2 \times 16.52 = 33.04 \)

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - Closest to \( 33.04 \) is \( 30 \).

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The closest choice is \( D. 30 \).

Final Answer: D
</think>

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and calculations, the length of \( JG \) is approximately \( 33.04 \), which is closest to choice \( D. 30 \). Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D
