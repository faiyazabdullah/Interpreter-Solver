**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and relationships.**

We have:
- Triangle AED.
- Points A, E, D, C, B, and F.
- Circle centered at F.
- Line AC is a secant intersecting Circle F.
- Line BE is a tangent to Circle F.
- Point E lies on Circle F.
- Measure of angle CAE is given as \(4 + x + 50 = x + 54\).
- Measure of angle ADE is given as \(3x\).
- Measure of angle AEB equals the sum of measures of angles CAE and ADE.

**Step 2: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**

Given:
- \( \angle AEB = \angle CAE + \angle ADE \)

We know that line BE is tangent to circle F at point E, and point E lies on the circle. Therefore, by the tangent-secant angle theorem, the measure of angle AEB is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc CE. Hence, we have:
\[ \angle AEB = \angle CAE + \angle ADE \]

**Step 3: Formulate equations based on the given conditions.**

From the problem:
\[ \angle AEB = (x + 54) + 3x \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \angle AEB = 4x + 54 \]

**Step 4: Solve for x using the geometric relationship.**

Since angle AEB is formed by a tangent and a chord (BE and AE), it equals the measure of the intercepted arc CE. We know:
\[ \angle AEB = \text{measure of arc CE} \]

However, the problem does not directly give us the measure of arc CE, but we can solve for x using the equation:
\[ \angle AEB = 4x + 54 \]

**Step 5: Consider possible values for x.**

We need to find x such that \(4x + 54\) is a valid angle measure. Since angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, and considering typical geometric constraints, we look for a reasonable value of x.

**Step 6: Calculate and verify.**

Let's test the answer choices:

- **A. \(x = 10\):**
  \[
  4x + 54 = 4(10) + 54 = 40 + 54 = 94
  \]

- **B. \(x = 30\):**
  \[
  4x + 54 = 4(30) + 54 = 120 + 54 = 174
  \]

- **C. \(x = 90\):**
  \[
  4x + 54 = 4(90) + 54 = 360 + 54 = 414 \quad (\text{not possible})
  \]

- **D. \(x = 120\):**
  \[
  4x + 54 = 4(120) + 54 = 480 + 54 = 534 \quad (\text{not possible})
  \]

The only feasible angle measure for \(\angle AEB\) is 174 degrees, which corresponds to \(x = 30\).

</think>
**Solution:**

Based on the calculations and verification, the correct value of \(x\) that satisfies the geometric constraints and results in a valid angle measure is \(x = 30\).
