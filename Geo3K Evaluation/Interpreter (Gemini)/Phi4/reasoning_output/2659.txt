**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Constraints**

- We have an equilateral triangle \( \triangle IWN \) with side lengths \( WN = 5 \).
- All sides of the triangle are equal: \( IW = WN = IN = 5 \).
- \( I \) is the center of the circle, and \( W \) and \( N \) lie on the circle, meaning \( IW \) and \( IN \) are radii of the circle.
- The measure of angle \( \angle WIN \) is given as \( 60^\circ \) because it's an equilateral triangle.
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( WN \), denoted as \(\widehat{WN}\).

**Step 2: Understanding the Relationship Between Angle and Arc**

- In a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that intercepts it.
- Therefore, the measure of arc \( WN \) is equal to the measure of angle \( \angle WIN \), which is \( 60^\circ \).

**Step 3: Converting Degrees to Radians**

- To find the measure of the arc in radians, convert \( 60^\circ \) to radians.
- The conversion factor from degrees to radians is \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).
- Therefore, \( 60^\circ \) in radians is:
  \[
  60^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{3}
  \]

**Step 4: Comparing with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of the arc \( \widehat{WN} \) is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- We need to compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. \(\frac{3}{5} \pi\)
  - B. \(\frac{5}{3} \pi\)
  - C. \(5 \pi\)
  - D. \(10 \pi\)

- The closest value to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) is \(\frac{3}{5} \pi\).

**Step 5: Final Decision**

- Since \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) is approximately \(1.047\), and \(\frac{3}{5} \pi\) is approximately \(1.884\), \(\frac{3}{5} \pi\) is the closest to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).

</think>

**Solution:**

The measure of the arc \( \widehat{WN} \) is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), which is closest to the answer choice \(\frac{3}{5} \pi\).
