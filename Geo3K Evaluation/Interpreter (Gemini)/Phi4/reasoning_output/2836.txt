### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information

1. **Circles and Points:**
   - Circles \( G \), \( J \), and \( K \) intersect at point \( L \).
   - Points \( B \) and \( H \) lie on circle \( G \).
   - Points \( D \) and \( J \) lie on circle \( J \).
   - Point \( C \) lies on circle \( K \).

2. **Specific Constraints:**
   - Line \( GH \) is a diameter of circle \( G \) with length 10.
   - Line \( JL \) is a radius of circle \( J \).
   - We need to find the length \( JL \).

### Step 2: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties

1. **Circle \( G \):**
   - Since \( GH \) is a diameter of circle \( G \) and its length is 10, the radius \( r_G \) of circle \( G \) is half of the diameter:
     \[
     r_G = \frac{10}{2} = 5
     \]

2. **Circle \( J \):**
   - \( JL \) is given as a radius of circle \( J \).
   - Since \( L \) lies on circle \( J \), \( JL \) is the radius of circle \( J \).

### Step 3: Determine the Measure of \( JL \)

- Since \( JL \) is a radius of circle \( J \) and no other specific information about circle \( J \) is given, we rely on the fact that \( JL \) is a radius.
- The problem states that \( JL \) is a radius, and since \( GH \) (a diameter of circle \( G \)) is 10, the radius of any circle intersecting at \( L \) could be the same as \( r_G \) if no other specific information is provided.

### Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices

- The calculated radius \( r_G \) of circle \( G \) is 5.
- Since \( JL \) is a radius and no other specific information about circle \( J \) is provided, the most logical assumption is that \( JL = r_G = 5 \).

### Step 5: Select the Closest Answer

- The calculated length of \( JL \) is 5.
- Among the answer choices, 5 corresponds to option A.
