<think>

**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**
- We are given a circle \( \odot G \) with radius 26.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, and F all lie on the circle.
- Chords \( \overline{AC} \) and \( \overline{DF} \) are chords of the circle and are congruent.
- Both chords are equidistant from the center of the circle.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**
- We need to find the length of the chord \( \overline{AC} \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( \overline{AC} \) and \( \overline{DF} \) are equidistant from the center and congruent, they must have the same perpendicular distance from the center.
- For any chord of a circle, the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord and the radius form a right triangle with half the chord as one of the legs.
- Let \( d \) be the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord \( \overline{AC} \).
- By the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the perpendicular distance:
  \[
  \left(\frac{AC}{2}\right)^2 + d^2 = 26^2
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Length of the Chord**
- Since \( \overline{AC} \) and \( \overline{DF} \) are equidistant from the center, they share the same \( d \).
- We can express \( AC \) in terms of \( d \):
  \[
  \left(\frac{AC}{2}\right)^2 = 26^2 - d^2
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AC}{2} = \sqrt{26^2 - d^2}
  \]
  \[
  AC = 2\sqrt{26^2 - d^2}
  \]

**Step 5: Use the Property of Equidistant Chords**
- For two chords to be equidistant from the center, they must be congruent, and thus have the same length.
- We need to find a specific value for \( AC \) that satisfies the conditions.
- Since \( AC = DF \) and both are equidistant, we can assume \( d \) is such that \( AC \) is a simple integer.
- Consider the maximum possible \( d \) where \( AC \) is an integer:
  - If \( d = 0 \), \( AC = 2 \times 26 = 52 \) (not an option).
  - Try \( d = 12 \):
    \[
    \left(\frac{AC}{2}\right)^2 = 26^2 - 12^2 = 676 - 144 = 532
    \]
    \[
    \frac{AC}{2} = \sqrt{532} = \sqrt{4 \times 133} = 2\sqrt{133}
    \]
    - \( AC = 4\sqrt{133} \), not an integer.
  - Try \( d = 10 \):
    \[
    \left(\frac{AC}{2}\right)^2 = 26^2 - 10^2 = 676 - 100 = 576
    \]
    \[
    \frac{AC}{2} = \sqrt{576} = 24
    \]
    \[
    AC = 2 \times 24 = 48
    \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated length \( AC = 48 \) matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

**Solution:**

By applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the perpendicular distance from the center, we found that the length of chord \( \overline{AC} \) is 48 when the perpendicular distance \( d = 10 \). This matches one of the provided answer choices.
