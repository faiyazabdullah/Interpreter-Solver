1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle \( J \) with points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( E \) lying on it.
   - Lines \( FI \) and \( GC \) intersect at point \( J \).
   - It is given that \( \angle 5 = \angle EJC \).
   - The measure of \( \angle EJC \) is half the sum of the measures of arcs \( EC \) and \( FB \).

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 5 \).
   - The problem provides a relationship involving arcs and angles, which suggests the use of the inscribed angle theorem or the intersecting chords theorem.

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - The measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords (like \( \angle EJC \)) is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle.
   - Therefore, \( \angle EJC = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Arc } EC + \text{Arc } FB) \).

4. **Exploring the Relationship:**
   - Since \( \angle 5 = \angle EJC \), we have:
     \[
     \angle 5 = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Arc } EC + \text{Arc } FB)
     \]

5. **Considering Possible Values:**
   - The problem does not provide specific measures for arcs \( EC \) and \( FB \), but we can infer that the sum of these arcs must be such that when halved, it matches one of the given answer choices.

6. **Calculating Possible Values:**
   - Let's denote \( \text{Arc } EC + \text{Arc } FB = x \).
   - Then, \( \angle 5 = \frac{x}{2} \).

7. **Matching with Answer Choices:**
   - We need \( \frac{x}{2} \) to match one of the answer choices: 50, 110, 130, or 150.
   - Therefore, \( x \) must be 100, 220, 260, or 300.

8. **Verifying the Closest Match:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the sum of two arcs on a circle, the maximum possible value for \( x \) is 360 (a full circle).
   - Among the possible values (100, 220, 260, 300), only 220 and 260 are feasible.
   - \( \frac{220}{2} = 110 \) and \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \).

9. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - Without additional constraints, both 110 and 130 are possible, but we must choose the closest to a typical scenario where arcs are not extreme.
   - Given typical geometric configurations, 130 is a more reasonable measure for such an angle.

</think>
Solution:
Given the constraints and typical geometric configurations, the measure of \( \angle 5 \) is most reasonably \( 130 \).
