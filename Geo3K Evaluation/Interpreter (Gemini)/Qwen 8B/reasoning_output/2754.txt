MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the quadrilateral BCDF. The points are B, C, F, D. Let me note down the given information:

- Lines BD and CF are parallel. So Line(B,D) || Line(C,F).
- Angles mentioned: Angle at BCF (which is angle BCF?), wait, the notation might be important here. Wait, the angles given are:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,F)) = 120°. So that's angle at point C between points B, C, F. So ∠BCF = 120°.

Then MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)) = 108°, which would be angle at point F between D, F, C. So ∠DFC = 108°.

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)) = 5y. That's angle at point B between D, B, C. So ∠DBC = 5y?

Wait, no. Wait, angle(D,B,C) would be angle at point B between D-B-C? Wait, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So ∠(D,B,C) is angle at B, with sides BD and BC. So yes, ∠DBC = 5y.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,F)) = 2x. That's angle at D between B-D-F. So ∠BDF = 2x.

Also, two equations:

Sum of measure of ∠DFC (which is 108°) and ∠BDF (which is 2x) equals 180°. So 108 + 2x = 180. Therefore, solving for x gives 2x = 72, so x=36. But wait, but there's another equation: Sum of measure of ∠BCF (120°) and ∠DBC (5y) equals 180°. So 120 + 5y = 180 → 5y=60 → y=12. 

But then why is the question asking for x? If that equation gives x directly as 36, then answer is A. However, maybe there's more to it because of the parallel lines. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Because the problem mentions quadrilateral BCDF, and BD || CF. Maybe there are some triangle relationships or using properties of parallelograms or transversals?

Let me check again. The key equations given are:

Equation 1: ∠DFC (108°) + ∠BDF (2x) = 180°. So that's straightforward. Solving gives 2x = 180 - 108 = 72 ⇒ x = 36. Which would make answer A. But why is there another equation involving 5y? Maybe there's a relation between these variables due to the parallel lines?

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angles. Let me confirm each angle again.

First, ∠BCF is 120°, which is at point C, between points B, C, F. Then ∠DFC is at point F, between D, F, C. Then ∠DBC is at point B, between D, B, C. And ∠BDF is at point D, between B, D, F.

Given BD || CF, so those lines are parallel. Since BD || CF, then maybe some alternate interior angles or corresponding angles?

Looking at line BD and CF being parallel, and considering transversal BF? Or DC? Wait, the quadrilateral is BCDF. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Points B, C, D, F forming a quadrilateral. BD and CF are parallel. So BD || CF. Let me think about triangles or other figures.

For example, consider triangle BCF. Wait, but BD is part of the quadrilateral. Alternatively, since BD || CF, then maybe triangle BDC and some other triangle?

Alternatively, looking at angles around points where the lines intersect. For instance, since BD || CF, then when a transversal crosses them, we can find relationships between angles.

Let me see. Suppose line DF is a transversal crossing BD and CF. Wait, BD is connected to D and B, while CF connects C and F. Not sure yet. Alternatively, line BC intersects BD and CF? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle DFC and triangle BDF? Wait, but I don't know if they're similar or congruent.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees? Wait, but the given angles may not cover all of them. Let me check.

The quadrilateral BCDF has four angles: at B, C, D, F. Let me list them:

At point B: angle DBC (which is 5y). Wait, but also angle at B could involve other angles? Wait, depending on how the quadrilateral is structured. Wait, quadrilateral BCDF – the vertices are B, C, D, F. So the angles are at each vertex:

At B: between points C, B, D? Wait, depends on the order of the quadrilateral. The quadrilateral is named as B, C, F, D. So the order is B connected to C, C connected to F, F connected to D, D connected to B. So the angles are:

At B: between D and C? Wait, the angle at B would be between D-B-C? Because the edges are D-B and B-C. So yes, angle DBC, which was given as 5y. At C: between B, C, F. So angle BCF = 120°. At F: between C, F, D. So angle CFD = 108°, as given. At D: between F, D, B. So angle FDB, which is given as 2x. Wait, but then the sum of these four angles should be 360 degrees. Let me check:

So total angles:

∠DBC (at B): 5y

∠BCF (at C): 120°

∠CDF (at D): ?

Wait, hold on. Wait, the angle at D is between F, D, B. So that's angle FDB, which is 2x. Wait, but earlier I thought ∠BDF is 2x. Wait, angle at D between F, D, B is ∠FDB, which is same as ∠BDF. So that's 2x. So adding up all four angles:

At B: 5y

At C: 120°

At D: 2x

At F: 108°

Total sum: 5y + 120 + 2x + 108 = 360

Therefore:

5y + 2x + 228 = 360

Which simplifies to 5y + 2x = 132.

But we also have another equation from the problem statement: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,F))) = 180. Which is ∠DFC (108°) + ∠BDF (2x) = 180, leading to 108 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 72 → x = 36. Then plugging back into above equation:

5y + 2*36 = 132 → 5y + 72 = 132 → 5y = 60 → y = 12. So that seems consistent. But the problem didn't ask for y; it asked for x. So according to this, x is 36, which is option A. But why does the problem mention the parallel lines? Is there a possibility that my assumption about the angles is wrong?

Wait, but maybe there's more relations due to BD || CF. Let me check again. Since BD || CF, then perhaps certain angles are supplementary or equal. For instance, if we consider the transversal connecting points C and D? Wait, line CD? Or line BF?

Alternatively, considering triangle BCF and triangle D... something. Wait, since BD || CF, then maybe alternate interior angles. Let me think. If BD || CF, then suppose line BC is a transversal. Wait, BD is parallel to CF. So if we take line BC, which starts at B and goes through C. Wait, BD is from B to D, and CF is from C to F. Are these lines intersected by some transversal?

Alternatively, since BD || CF, then the angles formed by a transversal would be related. For example, if line BF is a transversal cutting BD and CF. Let me imagine that. Points B and F are connected? In the quadrilateral BCDF, the sides are BC, CF, FD, DB. So BF is a diagonal. So line BF connects B to F. Since BD || CF, then BF is a transversal. So the angles made by BF with BD and CF would be related.

At point B, the line BF makes an angle with BD (which is part of the side BD). Wait, BD is from B to D. So BF is going from B to F. Similarly, at point F, line CF is from C to F. So BF meets CF at F. So the angles at B and F along BF would be related.

But maybe this isn't necessary because the previous equations already give us x=36. But why is the problem giving all that info? Maybe there's an error in assuming that the sum of the four angles is 360? Wait, quadrilaterals do have angle sums of 360 degrees. So unless the figure is not convex, but the problem doesn't specify that. Assuming it's convex, the sum should be 360. So that equation holds.

But according to the given data, we have:

From the first equation: 2x = 72 → x=36. So answer A. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem's given equations.

The problem says:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,F))), 180)

Which translates to ∠DFC + ∠BDF = 180°. As ∠DFC is 108°, then ∠BDF = 72°, hence 2x = 72 → x=36. So that's straightforward. Therefore, answer is A. However, sometimes problems have tricks. Let me check if ∠BDF is indeed adjacent to ∠DFC, making them supplementary. But since BD || CF, and DF is a transversal, then ∠BDF and ∠DFC are consecutive interior angles? Wait, if BD || CF, and DF is a transversal, then ∠BDF and ∠DFC would be consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. Yes! So their sum is 180°, which matches the given equation. Hence, that confirms that 108 + 2x = 180 → x=36. So that's solid.

Thus, even without considering the quadrilateral angle sum, the direct equation gives x=36. Therefore, answer is A. But let me check again if there's any other constraint I missed.

Another equation given: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C))), 180). Which is ∠BCF + ∠DBC = 180. So 120 + 5y = 180 → 5y=60 → y=12. This tells us about angle at B and angle at C. But since BD || CF, maybe there's a relationship here. For example, if we look at triangle BCF, but not sure. However, since BD || CF, then maybe ∠BCF and ∠CBD are related via some property.

Wait, ∠BCF is 120°, which is at point C. ∠DBC is 5y, which is at point B. If BD || CF, then maybe those angles are related through alternate interior angles? Wait, if we consider a transversal BC cutting BD and CF. Wait, BD is parallel to CF, and BC is a transversal. So the angles formed at B and C would be alternate interior angles?

Wait, BD || CF, and BC is a transversal. So the angle between BC and BD at B (∠DBC) would be equal to the angle between BC and CF at C (∠BCF)? Wait, no. Alternate interior angles would be equal. So ∠DBC (at B) and ∠BCF (at C) would be alternate interior angles. But ∠DBC is 5y and ∠BCF is 120°, so 5y = 120°? But earlier calculation gave 5y=60. Contradiction? Wait, this suggests inconsistency. What's wrong here?

Hold on, this is critical. If BD || CF and BC is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠DBC and ∠BCF. So they should be equal. But according to the problem, ∠BCF is 120°, and ∠DBC is 5y. So according to the alternate interior angles theorem, they should be equal. Therefore, 5y = 120° → y=24. But previously, from the equation SumOf(∠BCF, ∠DBC)=180°, we had 120 + 5y = 180 → 5y=60 → y=12. There's a contradiction here. So which one is correct?

This implies that there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Here's the problem: My initial assumption that the sum of the four angles of the quadrilateral is 360° is only valid if the quadrilateral is convex. However, if the angles ∠BCF and ∠DBC are supposed to be supplementary (as per the second equation), then the quadrilateral cannot be convex. Wait, but how?

Wait, if BD || CF and BC is a transversal, then alternate interior angles would be equal. Therefore, ∠DBC = ∠BCF. But according to the problem's given equation, ∠BCF + ∠DBC = 180°, meaning they are supplementary. So that would mean that ∠DBC = ∠BCF = 90°, but that contradicts both equations unless both are 90°, which they aren't. So there's a conflict here. Hence, my earlier approach is flawed.

So what's the real issue here? Let me re-express.

If BD || CF, then the alternate interior angles created by transversal BC should be equal. So ∠DBC (at B) and ∠BCF (at C) should be equal. But according to the problem's second condition, their sum is 180°. Hence, if they are equal, their sum would be 2*angle = 180°, so each is 90°, but the problem states ∠BCF is 120°, which conflicts. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless my understanding of the angles is incorrect.

Wait, this means that my identification of the angles is wrong. Let me re-examine the angle notations.

Original problem:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,F)) = 120°. So angle at C between B, C, F. So ∠BCF = 120°.

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)) = 5y. So angle at B between D, B, C. So ∠DBC = 5y.

Now, if BD || CF, then the transversal BC creates alternate interior angles. The angle at B (∠DBC) and the angle at C (∠BCF) would be alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. But according to the problem's second condition, ∠BCF + ∠DBC = 180°, implying they are supplementary. Thus, this would require ∠DBC = ∠BCF = 90°, but ∠BCF is given as 120°, which is a contradiction. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding of the angle positions.

Perhaps the angle ∠BCF is not the alternate interior angle. Let me double-check the diagram structure.

Quadrilateral BCDF: Points B, C, F, D. So edges are BC, CF, FD, DB. So the transversal BC connects points B and C. The lines BD and CF are parallel. So line BD is from B to D, and line CF is from C to F. So if you imagine BD || CF, and BC is a transversal connecting B to C, then the alternate interior angles would be between BD and CF, cut by BC. 

Wait, the alternate interior angles would be ∠DBC (at B) and ∠BCF (at C). So they should be equal. But according to the problem, they add up to 180°, which would imply they are supplementary, not equal. This suggests that either the diagram is not a standard convex quadrilateral, or my identification of the angles is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠BCF is not the one I think. Let me clarify:

∠BCF is the angle at C between B, C, F. So in the quadrilateral BCDF, that would be the internal angle at point C. Similarly, ∠DBC is the angle at B between D, B, C, which is the internal angle at B.

If BD || CF, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠DBC and ∠BCF. Hence, they should be equal. But according to the problem's given conditions, they add up to 180°, which implies they are supplementary. This is only possible if both angles are 90°, but ∠BCF is given as 120°, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, suggesting that my initial assumptions about the angles are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the angle ∠BCF is not an interior angle? Or maybe the lines are arranged differently. Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally.

Assume BD || CF. Let's place point B somewhere, and draw BD horizontally. Then CF is parallel to BD, so also horizontal. Point C is connected to F, so if BD is horizontal, CF is horizontal. Let me assume coordinates to make it clearer.

Let me assign coordinates to points:

Let’s say point B is at (0, 0).

Since BD is a line, let me assume D is at (a, 0) for some a > 0, making BD horizontal.

CF is parallel to BD, so it's also horizontal. Let me assume point C is at (b, c), and point F is at (d, c), since CF is horizontal (same y-coordinate).

Now, quadrilateral BCDF has points B(0,0), C(b,c), F(d,c), D(a,0).

Now, compute angles:

∠BCF is the angle at C between B, C, F. So vectors CB and CF.

Vector CB = B - C = (0 - b, 0 - c) = (-b, -c)

Vector CF = F - C = (d - b, c - c) = (d - b, 0)

The angle between these vectors is ∠BCF = 120°.

Similarly, ∠DBC is the angle at B between D, B, C. Vector BD = D - B = (a, 0), vector BC = C - B = (b, c). The angle between BD and BC is ∠DBC = 5y.

According to the alternate interior angles, since BD || CF, and BC is a transversal, ∠DBC and ∠BCF should be equal. But according to the problem, they sum to 180°, which is conflicting. Hence, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle ∠BCF is not between CB and CF, but between BC and CF? Wait, angle notation: ∠BCF means the angle at point C, with segments CB and CF. So yes, between CB and CF. Hence, the angle between CB and CF at C. 

But if BD || CF, then the direction of CF is parallel to BD. So the slope of CF is same as BD. In my coordinate system, BD is horizontal, so CF is horizontal. So vector CF is horizontal. Vector CB is from C to B, which is (-b, -c). The angle between CB and CF (horizontal) is ∠BCF = 120°. 

Meanwhile, ∠DBC is the angle at B between BD (from B to D, which is along positive x-axis) and BC (from B to C, which is vector (b, c)). So ∠DBC is the angle between BD (positive x-axis) and BC (vector (b, c)).

In this setup, if BD || CF, which is horizontal, then the alternate interior angle would be between CF (horizontal) and BC, but that might not align with the angle at B. Perhaps I'm miscalculating the alternate interior angles.

Alternatively, maybe the transversal is not BC but another line. Let me think. BD || CF. Another transversal could be BF or CD.

Let me consider line BF. It connects B to F. Since BD || CF, and BF is a transversal, then the angles formed at B and F could be related. For example, ∠BDF (at D) and ∠DFC (at F) are on the same side, but not sure.

Alternatively, since BD || CF, then the angles formed by a transversal DF would have relationships. Let me consider DF as a transversal. At point D, angle between BD and DF is ∠BDF = 2x. At point F, angle between CF and DF is ∠DFC = 108°. Since BD || CF, these two angles are consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So ∠BDF + ∠DFC = 180°, which matches the given equation. Hence, this confirms that 2x + 108 = 180 → x = 36. So this part is correct.

But the earlier contradiction with the alternate interior angles suggests something else. Why is there a discrepancy?

Maybe the angle ∠BCF is not an alternate interior angle. Let me think: If BD || CF, then the transversal BC creates angles at B and C. The angle at B is ∠DBC, and the angle at C is ∠BCF. These would be alternate interior angles if the transversal is BC, cutting BD and CF. But in reality, the angle at C is ∠BCF, which is between CB and CF. While the angle at B is ∠DBC, between BD and BC. Since BD || CF, these should be equal. But according to the problem, they sum to 180°, implying they are supplementary, not equal. This contradiction suggests that either the diagram is not simple, or there is a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the lines BD and CF are not on the same side? Like, if they are parallel but pointing in opposite directions. Or perhaps the quadrilateral is self-intersecting? But the problem refers to a quadrilateral, which typically assumes non-intersecting sides.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠BCF is actually an exterior angle? Or perhaps the alternate interior angle is not ∠BCF but another angle.

Wait, let's calculate using coordinates. Assume specific values to test.

Let me set coordinates as before: B(0,0), D(a,0), C(b,c), F(d,c), with CF parallel to BD (both horizontal).

Compute ∠BCF: at point C, between B(0,0), C(b,c), F(d,c). So vectors CB = (0-b, 0-c) = (-b, -c), CF = (d - b, 0). The angle between these vectors is 120°.

Compute ∠DBC: at point B, between D(a,0), B(0,0), C(b,c). Vectors BD = (a, 0), BC = (b, c). The angle between BD and BC is 5y.

If BD || CF, then the slopes of BD and CF are equal. Since BD is horizontal (slope 0), CF is also horizontal (slope 0). So CF is horizontal.

Now, let's calculate the angle between CB and CF (which is ∠BCF = 120°). Let's use dot product.

Vectors CB = (-b, -c), CF = (d - b, 0). The angle θ between them is:

cosθ = (CB · CF)/(|CB| |CF|)

CB · CF = (-b)(d - b) + (-c)(0) = -b(d - b)

|CB| = sqrt(b² + c²)

|CF| = sqrt((d - b)^2 + 0^2) = |d - b|

So cosθ = [-b(d - b)] / [sqrt(b² + c²) * |d - b|] = -b / sqrt(b² + c²) * sign(d - b)

Assuming d > b, so sign(d - b) = +1. Then cosθ = -b / sqrt(b² + c²)

We know θ is 120°, so cosθ = cos(120°) = -1/2.

So:

-b / sqrt(b² + c²) = -1/2 → b / sqrt(b² + c²) = 1/2 → squaring both sides:

b² / (b² + c²) = 1/4 → 4b² = b² + c² → 3b² = c² → c = b√3.

So, for example, let's choose b = 1, then c = √3. Now, let's compute ∠DBC.

At point B, vectors BD = (a, 0) and BC = (1, √3). The angle between BD and BC is ∠DBC = 5y.

Using dot product again:

BD · BC = a*1 + 0*√3 = a

|BD| = sqrt(a² + 0) = a

|BC| = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2

So cosφ = (a) / (a * 2) = 1/2 → φ = 60°.

Thus, ∠DBC = 60°, which would mean 5y = 60 → y = 12. 

But according to the alternate interior angles, we expected ∠DBC = ∠BCF. But ∠BCF was 120°, and ∠DBC is 60°. This shows a contradiction. Why?

Because in this setup, the alternate interior angles are not equal. What's the reason?

Ah! Because the transversal is BC, and the lines BD and CF are parallel, but the angle ∠BCF is not the alternate interior angle. Instead, the alternate interior angle would be the angle between BC and CF at point C, but that's ∠BCF. Wait, but in our calculation, ∠BCF is 120°, and ∠DBC is 60°, which are not equal. This indicates that my previous assumption about the alternate interior angles was wrong.

What's the correct alternate interior angle here? When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. In this case, the transversal is BC, crossing BD and CF. The alternate interior angles would be:

On one side of BC: the angle between BD and BC at B (∠DBC), and on the other side, the angle between CF and BC at C. Wait, but the angle between CF and BC at C is ∠BCF. So if BD || CF, then ∠DBC and ∠BCF should be equal. But in our example, they are 60° and 120°, respectively. This suggests a contradiction, which means my coordinate example is invalid.

Wait, in the example, I chose specific values that led to ∠BCF = 120°, but ∠DBC = 60°. How is that possible? It must mean that the assumption that BD || CF and the existence of such an angle is not compatible with the given angles unless the diagram is not planar or something else. But that's impossible.

Wait, let me recalculate ∠BCF in the example. With b=1, c=√3, and CF being horizontal. Point C is at (1, √3), F is at (d, √3). Vector CF is (d-1, 0). Vector CB is (-1, -√3). The angle between them is computed as follows:

Dot product: (-1)(d-1) + (-√3)(0) = -(d-1)

|CB| = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2

|CF| = |d - 1|

So cosθ = -(d-1)/(2 * |d-1|) = -sign(d-1)/2

Assuming d > 1, then cosθ = -1/2 → θ = 120°, which matches. So ∠BCF = 120°, as desired.

But ∠DBC is the angle between BD (along x-axis) and BC (vector (1, √3)), which we calculated as 60°. So why is this not equal to ∠BCF? Because the alternate interior angles should be equal. What's wrong here?

Ah! Wait, the alternate interior angles are on different sides of the transversal. Let me visualize: Transversal BC crosses BD at B and CF at C. The alternate interior angles would be ∠DBC (on one side of BC) and ∠FCB (on the other side). Wait, ∠FCB is the same as ∠BCF? No, ∠BCF is at point C between B, C, F. So it's the angle between CB and CF. Whereas the alternate interior angle would be the angle between BC and CF at point C, which is ∠BCF. Wait, but that's the same angle. So why isn't it equal to ∠DBC?

Wait, no. The alternate interior angles are inside the two parallel lines. So when the transversal BC crosses BD and CF, the alternate interior angles would be:

On one side of the transversal BC: the angle between BD and BC at B (∠DBC), and on the other side, the angle between CF and BC at C. Wait, but at point C, the angle between CF and BC is ∠BCF. But if BD || CF, then ∠DBC and ∠BCF should be equal. But in our example, they are 60° and 120°, which are not equal. This suggests that there's an error in the logic.

Wait, perhaps the angle at C is not ∠BCF but another angle? Or maybe the transversal is not BC but another line?

Wait, let me think differently. The alternate interior angles would be ∠DBC and ∠DCF? Or something else? Maybe I'm misidentifying the angles.

Alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal crosses two lines. They are on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the two lines. So in this case, the transversal is BC, crossing BD and CF. The alternate interior angles would be:

- One angle is between BD and BC at B (∠DBC), and the other is between CF and BC at C. But at point C, the angle between CF and BC is ∠BCF, which is 120°, and ∠DBC is 60°, which are not equal. This suggests that either the lines are not parallel, or there's an error in the setup.

But in our coordinate example, BD is parallel to CF. So why aren't the alternate interior angles equal? This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the angle at C is not ∠BCF but ∠FCB? Wait, ∠FCB is the same as ∠BCF. Or perhaps the angle between CF and CB is ∠FCB, which is the same as ∠BCF. So why the discrepancy?

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, or my understanding of the angles. Given that the problem provides both conditions that lead to contradictions, but the direct calculation from the given equations gives x=36, which matches the supplementary angle condition, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the alternate interior angles and rely solely on the given equations.

Since the problem provides two equations:

1. ∠DFC + ∠BDF = 180° → 108 + 2x = 180 → x=36

2. ∠BCF + ∠DBC = 180° → 120 + 5y = 180 → y=12

Even though this leads to a contradiction with the alternate interior angles, perhaps the problem assumes that the diagram is such that these conditions are satisfied despite the apparent contradiction. Perhaps the diagram is not convex, or the angles are oriented differently.

Given that the problem asks for x, and based on the given equations, x=36 is derived directly, and the other condition about the alternate interior angles might be a red herring or there's a different configuration. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 36.

Hence, Final Answer: A.

### **Step 2: Use the First Equation**

We apply the first given equation:
$$
\angle DFC + \angle BDF = 180^\circ
$$
Substituting the known values:
$$
108^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ
$$
Solving for $ x $:
$$
2x = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ \\
x = \frac{72}{2} = 36
$$

### **Step 3: Cross-Verification Using the Second Equation**

Next, examine the second equation:
$$
\angle BCF + \angle DBC = 180^\circ
$$
Substitute:
$$
120^\circ + 5y = 180^\circ \\
5y = 60^\circ \\
y = 12
$$

While this gives us the value of $ y $, it is not needed for finding $ x $. We were specifically asked for the value of $ x $, which we have already determined using the first equation.

### **Step 4: Geometric Consistency Check**

Although there appears to be a potential conflict regarding the alternate interior angles due to the parallelism of $ BD \parallel CF $, the direct application of the given angle relationships—especially the supplementary nature of $ \angle DFC $ and $ \angle BDF $—provides sufficient confirmation that:

$$
\angle DFC + \angle BDF = 180^\circ
$$

is a valid and consistent constraint.

Thus, the solution derived from this relationship is accurate.

### **Conclusion**

Based on the given angle relationships and their direct implications, the value of $ x $ is:

$$
\boxed{36}
$$
