MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So we have a rhombus ABCD. The points A, B, C, D form a rhombus. Then there are some lines mentioned: Line AB, BC, CD, DA, which make sense as the sides of the rhombus. Also, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. 

The problem states that AB equals 2x + 3 and BC equals 5x. Additionally, it says that AB equals BC because they're equal in a rhombus? Wait, noâ€”wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So maybe there's a mistake here? Wait, hold on. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says: "Given the geometric constraints... Rhombus(A,B,C,D)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Add(Mul(2,x),3)) Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Mul(5,x)) Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),LengthOf(Line(B,C)))". Oh! So they set AB equal to BC, but since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides should be equal. Therefore, AB must equal BC, so that equation is giving us an equation to solve for x. So AB = BC implies that 2x + 3 = 5x. Solving that would give 3 = 3x, so x = 1. Then AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5, and BC = 5(1) = 5. That checks out. So x=1. But how does that help us find angle AEB?

Now, the question is about angle AEB. Point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So they intersect at 90 degrees. But also, they bisect each other. However, the diagonals in a rhombus aren't necessarily equal unless it's a square. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal. 

But wait, the problem also mentions that angle AEB is a right angle. Wait, the constraints say "Perpendicular(Line(A,C),Line(B,D))", so the diagonals are perpendicular. And then "Angle(A,E,B)" is a right angle. Wait, but if diagonals are perpendicular, then angle AEB is formed by the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. So angle AEB should be 90 degrees. But why is that considered as part of the problem? Because the problem says "Angle(A,E,B)" is a right angle. Wait, but isn't that just restating that the diagonals are perpendicular? Maybe the problem is trying to confirm that. 

Wait, but the answer choices include 90 as option C. So perhaps the answer is 90 degrees. But let me think again. If the diagonals are perpendicular, then angle between them is 90 degrees. So angle AEB is 90 degrees. Hence, the measure of angle AEB is 90 degrees, so the answer is C. But wait, let me check if there's more to it. 

Alternatively, could there be something else? For example, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. But angle AEB is the angle between the two diagonals, which are perpendicular. Therefore, regardless of the side lengths, angle AEB is always 90 degrees. Therefore, even without knowing x, the answer is 90 degrees. But the problem gives equations involving x. However, solving those equations was necessary to confirm that the sides are equal (so x=1). But once we know that it's a rhombus, the fact that diagonals are perpendicular is inherent. Therefore, angle AEB is 90 degrees. 

So the answer should be C. But let me check again. Suppose someone might think that angle AEB is half of something, but no. Since diagonals are perpendicular, their intersection forms four right angles. So angle AEB is definitely 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C.
