====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a circle with center P and radius 2 inches. Points Q, R, S, T are all on the circumference of this circle because they lie on Circle(P). Then there are lines PQ, PR, PS, PT, which are radii since each connects the center P to a point on the circle. The lengths of these lines are given as 2 inches, which makes sense because that's the radius.

Now, the question asks for the length of arc RS. To find the length of an arc, I remember the formula involves the central angle subtended by the arc and the radius. The formula is:

Arc Length = θ × r

But θ has to be in radians. Wait, but here we're given angles at point P. Let me check the problem again. It says Angle(Q,P,R) measures 112 degrees and Angle(R,P,S) measures 130 degrees. Wait, hold on. Are those angles referring to angles at point P? Because the notation Angle(Q,P,R) would mean the angle at point P between points Q and R. Similarly, Angle(R,P,S) is the angle at P between R and S. 

So, if we consider the two angles given: ∠QPR is 112°, and ∠RPS is 130°. But wait, how do these angles relate to the arc RS? Let me visualize this. If points Q, R, S, T are all on the circle centered at P, then lines PQ, PR, PS, PT are radii. So, the angle between PQ and PR is 112°, and between PR and PS is 130°. Therefore, the total angle between PQ and PS would be 112 + 130 = 242 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.

Wait, actually, if you have points Q, R, S arranged around the circle such that angle QPR is 112°, and angle RPS is 130°, then the angle between PQ and PS would be the sum of those two angles. However, arcs correspond to the central angles. So, the arc QR corresponds to angle QPR (which is 112°), and arc RS corresponds to angle RPS (which is 130°)? Wait, but that can't be right because the problem mentions arc RS. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the positions of the points.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in order Q, R, S, T around the circle? But the problem states four points Q, R, S, T lying on the circle. However, only angles involving Q, R, S are mentioned. The angle QPR is 112°, and angle RPS is 130°. So, starting from point Q, going through R, then to S. So, angle at P between Q and R is 112°, and angle between R and S is 130°, so the arc from Q to S would be the sum of those two angles. But the question is about arc RS. Hmm.

Wait, arc RS would correspond to the central angle between R and S, which is given as angle RPS, which is 130 degrees. Wait, but angle RPS is the angle at P between R and S. So yes, that central angle would directly correspond to the measure of arc RS. So, if that angle is 130 degrees, then the arc length should be θ * r, where θ is in radians.

But let me confirm. The central angle corresponding to arc RS is indeed angle RPS, which is 130 degrees. Therefore, converting that to radians, multiply by π/180. Then multiply by radius 2.

Let me compute that. First, convert 130 degrees to radians. 130° × π / 180 = (13π)/18 radians. Then arc length is 13π/18 × 2. Let me calculate that value numerically.

First, 13 divided by 18 is approximately 0.7222... Multiply by π ≈ 3.1416 gives 0.7222 × 3.1416 ≈ 2.268 radians. Then multiply by 2 gives 2.268 × 2 ≈ 4.536 inches. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 4.54. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 4.54. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the angle. Is angle RPS really the central angle for arc RS?

Yes, because the central angle is formed by two radii connecting to the endpoints of the arc. So, points R and S are connected to center P, forming angle RPS, which is the central angle for arc RS. Therefore, the measure of the arc RS is equal to the measure of that central angle, which is 130 degrees. So, converting that to radians and multiplying by radius gives the arc length.

Therefore, my calculation seems correct. So 130 degrees converted to radians is (130 × π)/180 = (13π)/18. Multiply by radius 2:

Arc length = 2 × (13π)/18 = (13π)/9 ≈ ?

Calculating 13π/9:

π ≈ 3.1416

13 × 3.1416 ≈ 40.8408

Divide by 9: 40.8408 / 9 ≈ 4.5378...

Which rounds to 4.54. Therefore, answer C.

But let me check once more. Maybe the angle isn't 130 degrees? Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(R,P,S)) is 130. That's angle at P between R and S, so yes, central angle for arc RS. So that's correct.

Another thing to check: sometimes, depending on the position of points, the angle could be reflex (greater than 180 degrees), but since the measure is given as 130 degrees, it's definitely less than 180, so that's fine. So no issues there.

Thus, the arc length is approximately 4.54, so answer C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of arc $ \widehat{RS} $ in circle $ \odot P $, we begin by analyzing the given information:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- All points $ Q, R, S, T $ lie on the circle centered at $ P $, making them equidistant from $ P $.
- Each line segment $ PQ, PR, PS, PT $ is a **radius** of the circle, and their lengths are all given as **2 inches**, confirming the circle’s radius is 2 units.
- The angle $ \angle RPS $ is explicitly stated to be **130°**, and since both $ PR $ and $ PS $ are radii of the circle, this angle is a **central angle** corresponding to the arc $ \widehat{RS} $.

---

### **Step 2: Arc Length Formula**
The formula for the **length of an arc** $ s $ in terms of its **central angle** $ \theta $ (in radians) and the **radius** $ r $ is:

$$
s = r\theta
$$

We are given:
- Radius $ r = 2 $
- Central angle $ \theta = 130^\circ $

Convert the angle from degrees to radians:

$$
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{130 \pi}{180} = \frac{13\pi}{18}
$$

Substitute into the formula:

$$
s = 2 \cdot \frac{13\pi}{18} = \frac{26\pi}{18} = \frac{13\pi}{9}
$$

Use $ \pi \approx 3.1416 $ to approximate:

$$
s \approx \frac{13 \times 3.1416}{9} \approx \frac{40.8408}{9} \approx 4.5378
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Result**
Rounding to the **nearest hundredth**, the arc length is approximately **4.54 inches**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given choices:
- A. 2.27  
- B. 3.91  
- C. 4.54  
- D. 7.82  

The correct answer is **C**.

**Final Answer: C**
