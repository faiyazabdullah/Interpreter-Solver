MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle Z, and points W, X, Y, Z. There are lines WX and XY. Both lines are tangent to the circle Z. Also, the lengths of these segments are related through equations involving x. The question asks for the value of x.

First, I need to recall some geometry concepts about tangents. If two tangent lines are drawn from the same external point to a circle, then those tangent segments are equal in length. Wait, but here, the lines WX and XY are both tangent to the circle. But do they share a common external point? Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points W, X, Y. Line WX is tangent to the circle at some point, say, maybe point Z? Wait, no, there's a point Z which is part of the circle. Wait, Circle(Z) – so the center of the circle is point Z? Or is Z just a label for the circle? Hmm, the notation might be that Circle(Z) means the circle has center Z. So, the circle is centered at point Z. Then, lines WX and XY are tangent to this circle.

So, line WX is tangent to the circle centered at Z, and line XY is also tangent to the same circle. Now, since both lines are tangent to the circle, their distances from the center Z must be equal to the radius of the circle. However, without knowing coordinates or specific positions, maybe I need another approach.

But wait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that both lines WX and XY are tangent to the circle, so maybe they are both tangent from the same external point? Wait, but the lines are WX and XY. So, if X is a point on both lines, meaning that line WX ends at X, and line XY starts at X. So, point X is connected to W and Y. Therefore, point X is the intersection point of lines WX and XY. Wait, but if both lines are tangent to the circle, then X could be an external point from which two tangent lines are drawn. Wait, but if X is an external point, then the two tangent lines would be from X to the circle, touching it at two different points. However, in this case, the lines WX and XY are both tangent to the circle. So, does that mean that line WX is tangent at one point, and line XY is tangent at another point?

Alternatively, maybe both lines are tangent at the same point? That seems unlikely unless they are the same line, but they are different lines (since they connect W-X and X-Y). So, likely, each line is tangent at a different point on the circle.

Now, considering that, if X is an external point from which two tangent lines are drawn to the circle, then the lengths of the tangent segments from X to the circle should be equal. Wait, but the tangent segments from X to the circle would be the same for both lines. Wait, but line WX and line XY are both tangent to the circle. So, the distance from X to the circle along each tangent line should be equal? Wait, but the tangent lines themselves are different. However, the length of the tangent from X to the circle is fixed. So, if line WX is tangent at point P, then XP is the length of the tangent from X to the circle. Similarly, if line XY is tangent at point Q, then XQ is also the length of the tangent from X to the circle. Therefore, XP = XQ. Hence, the lengths of the tangent segments from X to the circle are equal. 

Therefore, in this case, the lengths of WX and XY would be equal? Because both are tangent segments from X to the circle. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the lengths of WX and XY are equal. Wait, the problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), LengthOf(Line(X,Y)))

So, that's given as a constraint. Therefore, the problem tells us that the length of WX equals the length of XY. But according to my previous reasoning, since both are tangent segments from X to the circle, their lengths should be equal. Which matches the given condition. So, that checks out. Therefore, the problem gives us that the two tangent segments from X to the circle have equal length, which is consistent.

But how does that help us find x? Well, the problem also relates the lengths of WX and XY to expressions involving x. Specifically:

Length of WX = 2x + 9

Length of XY = 3x + 6

And since they are equal, we can set them equal to each other:

2x + 9 = 3x + 6

Solving that equation would give x = 3. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me write down the equations:

Given that Length(WX) = 2x + 9

Length(XY) = 3x + 6

And Length(WX) = Length(XY)

So setting them equal:

2x + 9 = 3x + 6

Subtract 2x from both sides:

9 = x + 6

Then subtract 6:

x = 3

So, x would be 3. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 3. So, the answer would be B. But wait, hold on—is there something missing here? Because I assumed that the lengths of WX and XY are equal because they are both tangent segments from X to the circle. But maybe there's more to it?

Wait, but the problem states that both lines WX and XY are tangent to the circle. But if X is outside the circle, then the tangent segments from X to the circle would indeed be equal. However, if X were inside the circle, then the lines wouldn't be tangent. So, X must be an external point. Therefore, the lengths of the tangent segments from X to the circle would be equal. Therefore, the length of WX and XY must be equal. Which is given in the problem. So, the equations given are redundant? Wait, but the problem gives that the lengths are equal, and also gives expressions for each length. Therefore, solving 2x+9=3x+6 gives x=3, which would be the answer. However, maybe there's more to the problem?

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Suppose that the lines WX and XY are tangent to the circle, but perhaps not necessarily from the same external point. Wait, but if line WX is tangent to the circle, then point W could be outside, and line WX touches the circle at some point. Similarly for line XY. However, the problem mentions that both lines are tangent to the circle. So, each line is tangent to the circle. So, line WX is tangent to the circle, meaning that it touches the circle at exactly one point. Similarly for line XY. However, the position of X relative to the circle isn't specified. But since both lines pass through X, and are tangent to the circle, that suggests that X is an external point from which two tangent lines are drawn. Therefore, the two tangent lines from X to the circle would be WX and XY. Thus, their lengths should be equal, hence the equality between WX and XY. Therefore, the equations given are consistent with that.

Hence, solving 2x + 9 = 3x + 6 leads directly to x = 3. So, the answer is B. But let me double-check if there's any alternative interpretation.

Another possibility: Maybe the circle is tangent to both lines WX and XY, but not necessarily that X is the external point. For example, maybe the circle is tangent to line WX at some point, and tangent to line XY at another point, but X is not necessarily outside the circle. However, if X is on the circle, then line WX would be tangent only if W is such that... Wait, if X is on the circle, then line WX would intersect the circle at X, so it cannot be tangent unless it's tangent at X. But then line WX would be tangent at X, implying that the line is perpendicular to the radius at X. Similarly for line XY. But in that case, the two tangent lines would meet at X, which is on the circle. But then, the two tangent lines from X would be... but if X is on the circle, then the tangent line at X is unique. So, if both lines WX and XY are tangent to the circle, then they would both have to be the same line, which contradicts that they are separate lines. Hence, this scenario is impossible. Therefore, X must be outside the circle, making the earlier conclusion valid.

Thus, the equations given lead directly to x=3, so answer B. Let me check the answer choices again: A.2, B.3, C.6, D.9. Yes, B is 3. Therefore, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem. We are told that:

- Lines $ WX $ and $ XY $ are **tangents** to a circle centered at point $ Z $.
- The lengths of these segments are defined algebraically as:
  - $ \text{Length}(WX) = 2x + 9 $
  - $ \text{Length}(XY) = 3x + 6 $
- Additionally, it is stated that:
  - $ \text{Length}(WX) = \text{Length}(XY) $

---

### Step 1: Use the Tangency Condition

Since both lines $ WX $ and $ XY $ are tangents to the same circle, and they intersect at point $ X $, this implies that point $ X $ lies **outside** the circle. From the property of tangents from a common external point to a circle, the **lengths of the tangents from that external point to the circle are equal**. This confirms that:

$$
\text{Length}(WX) = \text{Length}(XY)
$$

This is consistent with the given information, so we proceed to equate the expressions for the lengths:

$$
2x + 9 = 3x + 6
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the Equation

$$
2x + 9 = 3x + 6 \\
9 - 6 = 3x - 2x \\
3 = x
$$

---

### Step 3: Match with Answer Choices

We now compare our solution with the provided answer choices:

- A. 2  
- B. 3  
- C. 6  
- D. 9  

Clearly, the correct value is $ x = 3 $, which corresponds to **Option B**.
