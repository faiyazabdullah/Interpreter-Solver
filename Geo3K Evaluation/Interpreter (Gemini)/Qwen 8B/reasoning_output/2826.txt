MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral WXYZ which is a rectangle. That means all the angles are right angles, right? Wait, but there's some other information here. Let me go through the constraints again.

First, they mention that Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z) is a Rectangle. So that tells me that opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all interior angles are 90 degrees. Then there are points A, lines connecting various points, and several angles labeled 1 through 12. But the key thing here is that angle 1 is given as 30 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 3.

Wait, but how do these angles relate? The problem also mentions Triangle(X,Z,A). Also, there's an intersection point A where line WZ intersects line XY. And it says that line WZ and line XY are diagonals of the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, the diagonals should be congruent and bisect each other. Also, since the diagonals in a rectangle are equal, so line WZ and line XY are both diagonals and hence congruent, which matches the constraint Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(X,Y)).

So, point A is the intersection of the two diagonals. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. Now, angle 1 is given as 30 degrees. I need to figure out which angle that refers to. The angles mentioned are 1 through 12. Let me think about the diagram.

Since there's a triangle XZA formed by points X, Z, and A. Point A is the intersection of diagonals. Let me sketch mentally. In rectangle WXYZ, diagonals WZ and XY intersect at A. So triangle XZA would be formed by points X, Z, and A. So angle 1 might be one of the angles in this triangle. However, without seeing the exact labels, I need to deduce based on the given info.

But the problem states that Angle(1) has measure 30 degrees. Let me consider possible positions of angle 1. Maybe angle at point X? Or maybe another angle?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 refers to an angle formed by the diagonal and a side. For example, when you draw a diagonal in a rectangle, it divides the rectangle into two triangles. The diagonal creates angles with the sides. If angle 1 is one of those angles, then maybe we can use trigonometry to find the measure.

Let me consider triangle XZA. Since diagonals in a rectangle are equal and bisect each other, so WA = AZ, and similarly for the other diagonal. So triangle XZA is an isosceles triangle? Wait, no. Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal but unless it's a square, the triangles formed by the diagonals aren't necessarily isosceles. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent but they split each other into halves. So, if we take triangle XZA, which connects points X, Z, and A (the intersection of diagonals). Let me think about the coordinates.

Maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s assume rectangle WXYZ with coordinates:

Let me set coordinate system with point W at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose length along x-axis is 'a' and height along y-axis is 'b'. Then:

- W: (0, 0)
- X: (a, 0)
- Y: (a, b)
- Z: (0, b)

Then diagonals are WZ and XY. Diagonal WZ goes from (0,0) to (0,b)? Wait no, wait. Wait, original rectangle is W, X, Y, Z. So the order is important. In a rectangle, adjacent vertices are connected. So if it's W-X-Y-Z-W, then sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. Wait, but the problem says that Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. Wait, according to the problem statement:

IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,Z),Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z)) and IsDiagonalOf(Line(X,Y),Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z)). So that suggests that Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. Wait, but in standard rectangle, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So for rectangle WXYZ, the diagonals should be WY and XZ. But according to the problem, Line(W,Z) is considered a diagonal. Wait, that seems conflicting. Unless the rectangle is labeled differently.

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. The rectangle is W, X, Y, Z. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. But the problem says that Line(W,Z) is a diagonal. Wait, that's different. So Line(W,Z) connects W to Z. In the rectangle, if the vertices are ordered W, X, Y, Z, then Z is adjacent to Y and W. Wait, so if you connect W to Z, that's actually a side? No, because in a rectangle, consecutive vertices are connected. So if the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z-W, then sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So Z is connected back to W. Therefore, WZ is a side? Wait, no. Wait, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So yes, ZW is a side. Therefore, connecting W to Z would be the same as side ZW. But the problem says that Line(W,Z) is a diagonal. This suggests that maybe the labeling is different. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is labeled such that W, X, Y, Z are arranged in a way that WZ is a diagonal. 

This confusion arises because of the labeling. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says:

Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z) is a Rectangle. Points W, X, Y, Z. Then Lines:

Line(W,X), Line(X,Z), Line(Z,Y), Line(Y,W). Wait, Line(Y,W) is part of the rectangle? Wait, the rectangle's sides should be W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. But according to the given lines:

They list Line(W,X), Line(X,Z), Line(Z,Y), Line(Y,W). Wait, Line(Y,W) is the same as Line(W,Y), which would be a diagonal if the rectangle isn't a square. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are adjacent vertices. So if the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z-W, then sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, Line(Y,W) is the same as Line(W,Y), which is a diagonal. Similarly, Line(X,Z) would be another diagonal. Wait, but in that case, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. Therefore, Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z) are diagonals. 

However, the problem states that Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. Wait, Line(X,Y) is a side of the rectangle, since X is connected to Y. So that contradicts. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.

The problem says:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Z)
Line(Z,Y)
Line(Y,W)
Line(W,Z)
Line(X,Y)"

Wait, so Line(W,Z) is listed as a diagonal. But in the rectangle, if the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW, then Line(W,Z) is a diagonal. So that makes sense. Because in the rectangle, if you connect W to Z, that skips over X and Y, making it a diagonal. Similarly, Line(X,Y) is a side. Wait, but the problem says that Line(X,Y) is a diagonal? Wait, no. Wait, looking back:

The problem lists:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Z)
Line(Z,Y)
Line(Y,W)
Line(W,Z)
Line(X,Y)"

Wait, but the constraints include:

"Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z))
Parallel(Line(W,Y), Line(X,Z))"

Ah! So Line(W,Y) is parallel to Line(X,Z). In a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So if Line(W,Y) is parallel to Line(X,Z), then that implies that Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z) are opposite sides. Therefore, Line(W,Y) must be one pair of opposite sides, and Line(X,Z) the other. Wait, but in the rectangle, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So Line(W,Y) is a diagonal, not a side. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Wait, maybe my initial assumption of the rectangle's vertex order is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let me define the rectangle with vertices W, X, Y, Z in order, forming a rectangle. So sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, the diagonals are WY and XZ. But according to the problem, Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. Wait, Line(X,Y) is a side. So something is wrong here. Perhaps the rectangle is not labeled in order? Like, maybe the vertices are not in order W-X-Y-Z around the rectangle? For example, maybe it's W, X, Z, Y? Not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to look at the other constraints.

Also, there's an intersection at point A between Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y). So Line(W,Z) is one diagonal, Line(X,Y) is another line. But Line(X,Y) is a side? Wait, if Line(X,Y) is a diagonal, then that would mean that in the rectangle, X and Y are opposite vertices. But normally, in a rectangle, adjacent vertices are connected by sides. So if X and Y are adjacent, then Line(X,Y) is a side. Hence, the only way Line(X,Y) can be a diagonal is if X and Y are opposite vertices. Which would imply that the rectangle is labeled differently. For example, if the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z with X and Y being opposite vertices, meaning that the order is W, X, Z, Y? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a non-standard labeling. Let me try to proceed with the given information.

Given that Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. So, they intersect at point A. Also, the diagonals are congruent. So, since they are diagonals of a rectangle, their lengths are equal. Also, they bisect each other. So point A is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, considering triangle XZA. So points X, Z, and A. Since A is the intersection of diagonals, and Line(W,Z) is one diagonal, Line(X,Y) is another. Wait, but Line(X,Y) is supposed to be a diagonal. Wait, if Line(X,Y) is a diagonal, then X and Y are opposite vertices. So in that case, the rectangle would have X and Y as opposite corners. Then the other diagonal would be WZ. So the diagonals are X-Y and W-Z. Therefore, the rectangle is structured such that X and Y are opposite corners, W and Z are the other two corners. So the rectangle could be labeled W, X, Y, Z in such a way that X and Y are opposite. For instance, imagine rectangle with vertices W, X, Y, Z placed clockwise as follows: W is bottom-left, X is top-left, Y is top-right, Z is bottom-right. Then the diagonals would be WY and XZ. But if the problem says that Line(X,Y) is a diagonal, then that would mean X and Y are opposite, but in this standard labeling, X and Y are adjacent. Therefore, this suggests that the labeling is different.

Perhaps the rectangle is labeled in a different order. Suppose the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y. So going from W to X to Z to Y to W. In that case, the sides would be WX, XZ, ZY, YW. Then the diagonals would be WZ and XY. Ah! So Line(W,Z) is a diagonal and Line(X,Y) is another diagonal. That fits with the problem's constraints. So the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, meaning that the vertices are arranged such that W is connected to X and Y, X is connected to W and Z, Z is connected to X and Y, Y is connected to Z and W. So in this arrangement, the diagonals are WZ and XY. Therefore, Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals, intersecting at point A, the center of the rectangle.

Okay, that makes sense. So with that labeling, the rectangle has vertices W, X, Z, Y arranged such that sides are WX, XZ, ZY, YW. So the diagonals are WZ and XY. So point A is the intersection of these diagonals.

Now, considering triangle XZA. Points X, Z, and A. So in this configuration, point X is one corner, point Z is another corner, and point A is the intersection of the diagonals. So triangle XZA is formed by connecting X to Z (which is a diagonal), and then connecting to A. Wait, but point A is already on the diagonal XZ. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the diagonals are WZ and XY. So point A is the intersection of WZ and XY. Therefore, point A lies on both diagonals. So, if I'm looking at triangle XZA, then points X, Z, and A. So X is one vertex, Z is another, and A is somewhere along the diagonal WZ. Wait, no. Wait, diagonal WZ connects W to Z. Diagonal XY connects X to Y. Their intersection is point A. So point A lies on both diagonals. Therefore, in triangle XZA, points X, Z, and A. So point A is on diagonal WZ (since WZ is a diagonal) and also on diagonal XY. So, in this setup, triangle XZA has vertices at X, Z, and A. Let me visualize this.

In rectangle WXYZ (with vertices W, X, Z, Y), diagonals WZ and XY intersect at A. So point A is inside the rectangle. So triangle XZA consists of points X, Z, and A. To find angle measures in this triangle, especially angle 1 which is given as 30 degrees.

Assuming angle 1 is one of the angles in triangle XZA. Let me think about the angles in triangle XZA. The triangle has vertices at X, Z, and A. So the angles would be at X, Z, and A.

But the problem mentions angles 1 through 12. Without knowing exactly which angle corresponds to which label, I need to infer based on the given information. But the problem specifically says "Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠1 = 30." So angle 1 is given as 30 degrees, and we need to find angle 3.

Possibly, angle 1 is one of the angles in triangle XZA, and angle 3 is another angle in the same or related triangle. Alternatively, angle 1 could refer to an angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals with the sides.

Alternatively, since there are multiple angles mentioned, maybe angle 1 is an angle created by the diagonal and a side. For example, if we consider the diagonal WZ and side XZ (assuming that XZ is a side?), but earlier analysis shows that in this labeling, XZ is a side. Wait, in our current labeling, the sides are WX, XZ, ZY, YW. So XZ is a side. So if we have diagonal WZ and side XZ meeting at point Z, creating an angle. But angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me think.

Another possibility: since the diagonals in a rectangle bisect each other, and they form certain angles. For example, the diagonals divide each other into segments. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but unless it's a square, they don't form 45-degree angles. So if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the diagonals, then depending on the aspect ratio of the rectangle, that angle can vary.

But since angle 1 is given as 30 degrees, which suggests that the rectangle is not a square. So let me try to model this.

Let me consider the rectangle with width and height such that the diagonals create specific angles. Let me denote the rectangle with length l (length of side WX) and width w (length of side XZ). Wait, in our previous labeling, the sides are WX, XZ, ZY, YW. So WX and ZY are the lengths, and XZ and YW are the widths. Wait, but since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So WX = ZY and XZ = YW.

The diagonals WZ and XY have length sqrt(l² + w²). When the diagonals intersect at A, they bisect each other, so each half-diagonal is sqrt(l² + w²)/2.

Now, focusing on triangle XZA. Points X, Z, and A. Let me consider triangle XZA. In this triangle, the sides are XZ (which is a side of the rectangle, length w), XA, and ZA. But since A is the midpoint of diagonal WZ, then ZA is half of diagonal WZ, which is sqrt(l² + w²)/2. Similarly, XA is half of diagonal XY, which is also sqrt(l² + w²)/2. So triangle XZA has two sides equal: XA and ZA, both equal to sqrt(l² + w²)/2, and the third side XZ equal to w. Therefore, triangle XZA is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides XA and ZA. Therefore, the base angles at X and Z are equal.

But angle 1 is given as 30 degrees. Assuming angle 1 is one of the angles in triangle XZA. Let's say angle at X is 30 degrees. Then, since it's an isosceles triangle, the angle at Z would also be 30 degrees, and the remaining angle at A would be 180 - 2*30 = 120 degrees. But the question asks for angle 3. So unless angle 3 refers to another angle, perhaps in another location.

Alternatively, angle 1 might be an angle formed by the diagonal and a side. For example, at point X, the diagonal XY meets side XZ. Wait, in our labeling, diagonal XY connects X to Y, and side XZ connects X to Z. So at point X, there are two lines: one is the side XZ (which is a width) and the other is the diagonal XY. The angle between them would be angle at X between XZ and XY. Let me calculate that angle.

To compute this angle, consider triangle XYZ. Wait, but in the rectangle, at point X, the sides are WX and XZ. Wait, no, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then at point X, the sides are WX and XZ. The diagonal XY goes from X to Y. So the angle between XZ and XY at point X is angle between side XZ and diagonal XY. Let me call this angle θ. Using trigonometry, tan(theta) equals the opposite over adjacent. Let me think.

If we consider the rectangle with sides WX = l (horizontal) and XZ = w (vertical). Wait, but in reality, the sides adjacent to X are WX and XZ. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So the angle between WX and XZ is 90 degrees. However, the diagonal XY forms some angle with XZ. Let me consider coordinates again.

Let me assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me place point X at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, and assuming that side XZ is vertical and side WX is horizontal. Wait, but need to adjust based on the labeling. Earlier, we had the rectangle as W, X, Z, Y with sides WX, XZ, ZY, YW. So starting at W, moving to X, then to Z, then to Y, then back to W.

Let me assign coordinates accordingly:

Let me define point X at (0, 0).

Since XZ is a side, let me assume that from X(0,0), moving to Z(a, 0), so that XZ is horizontal. Then, since it's a rectangle, the next side ZY should be vertical upwards. So point Y would be at (a, b), and point W would be at (0, b). Wait, but then connecting back to W would require that YW is the side from Y(a,b) to W(0,b), which is horizontal left. Then the sides are:

- WX: from W(0,b) to X(0,0): vertical down.
- XZ: from X(0,0) to Z(a,0): horizontal right.
- ZY: from Z(a,0) to Y(a,b): vertical up.
- YW: from Y(a,b) to W(0,b): horizontal left.

Wait, in this case, the diagonals are WZ and XY.

- Diagonal WZ connects W(0,b) to Z(a,0).
- Diagonal XY connects X(0,0) to Y(a,b).

These diagonals intersect at point A, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So midpoint of WZ is ((0+a)/2, (b+0)/2) = (a/2, b/2). Midpoint of XY is ((0+a)/2, (0+b)/2) = same point (a/2, b/2). So point A is at (a/2, b/2).

Now, triangle XZA consists of points X(0,0), Z(a,0), and A(a/2, b/2).

So, to find the angles of triangle XZA, let's first determine the lengths of its sides.

Length of XZ: distance between X(0,0) and Z(a,0) is a units.

Length of XA: distance between X(0,0) and A(a/2, b/2):

sqrt[(a/2 - 0)^2 + (b/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt(a²/4 + b²/4) = (sqrt(a² + b²))/2.

Similarly, length of ZA: distance between Z(a,0) and A(a/2, b/2):

sqrt[(a/2 - a)^2 + (b/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(-a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2] = same as above, (sqrt(a² + b²))/2.

Therefore, triangle XZA has sides:

XZ = a,

XA = ZA = (sqrt(a² + b²))/2.

Thus, triangle XZA is isosceles with legs XA and ZA equal, and base XZ.

So, angles at X and Z are equal. Let's call them both α, and angle at A is β.

We know that angle sum is 180°, so 2α + β = 180°.

Now, if angle 1 is one of these angles. Let's assume that angle 1 is one of the base angles, say at X or Z. Given that angle 1 is 30°, then α = 30°, leading to β = 180 - 2*30 = 120°. Alternatively, if angle 1 is the angle at A, then β = 30°, and the base angles would be (180 - 30)/2 = 75° each.

But the problem says to find the measure of angle 3. Since angle numbers are not specified, we need to figure out which angle corresponds to which number. However, since the problem mentions angle 1 is 30°, and asks for angle 3, it's likely that angle 1 and angle 3 are related in the diagram.

Alternatively, angle 1 may refer to an angle formed by the diagonal and a side elsewhere. For example, at point Z, the diagonal WZ meets the side ZY. Let me explore that.

At point Z, the diagonal WZ connects Z to W(0,b), and the side ZY connects Z(a,0) to Y(a,b). The angle between these two lines at point Z would be angle between WZ and ZY. Let's calculate that angle.

Vector from Z to W is (-a, b), and vector from Z to Y is (0, b). The angle between these vectors can be found using the dot product.

Dot product: (-a)(0) + (b)(b) = b².

Magnitude of vector ZW: sqrt(a² + b²).

Magnitude of vector ZY: sqrt(0² + b²) = b.

So cos(theta) = (b²)/(sqrt(a² + b²)*b) ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²).

Which means theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arctan(a/b). Wait, because if we consider a right triangle with opposite side a and adjacent side b, then tan(theta) = a/b. Wait, no, let me think. Wait, theta is the angle between ZW and ZY. If I imagine at point Z, the vector ZW goes from Z(a,0) to W(0,b), which is direction (-a, b). The vector ZY goes from Z(a,0) to Y(a,b), which is (0, b). So the angle between these vectors is theta. 

Using the formula:

tan(theta) = |(vector ZW × vector ZY)| / (vector ZW · vector ZY)

Cross product magnitude is |(-a)(b) - (b)(0)| = |-ab| = ab.

Dot product is b² as before.

So tan(theta) = ab / b² = a/b => theta = arctan(a/b).

Similarly, if we consider that angle at Z between ZY and ZW is arctan(a/b). 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is this angle, then arctan(a/b) = 30°, implying that a/b = tan(30°) = 1/√3 → a/b = 1/√3 → b = a√3.

In that case, the sides of the rectangle are a and b = a√3. Now, returning to triangle XZA. We can compute its angles.

Earlier, we said that triangle XZA has sides XZ = a, XA = ZA = sqrt(a² + b²)/2 = sqrt(a² + 3a²)/2 = sqrt(4a²)/2 = 2a/2 = a. So XA = ZA = a, and XZ = a. Therefore, triangle XZA is equilateral? Because all sides are equal to a. Thus, all angles are 60 degrees. But that would mean angle 1 is 60 degrees, which conflicts with given angle 1 = 30 degrees. Hmm, contradiction here. What went wrong?

Wait, if a/b = 1/√3 → b = a√3. Then, sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(a² + 3a²) = sqrt(4a²) = 2a. So XA and ZA are each 2a/2 = a. XZ is length a. So indeed, triangle XZA is equilateral with all sides equal to a. Therefore, all angles are 60 degrees. So if angle 1 is one of these angles, it should be 60°, but the problem says angle 1 is 30°, so this scenario doesn't fit. Hence, my assumption that angle 1 is the angle at Z between ZY and ZW is incorrect.

Alternative possibility: angle 1 is the angle between the diagonal XY and side XZ at point X. Let me calculate that angle.

At point X(0,0), the diagonal XY goes from X(0,0) to Y(a,b), and side XZ goes from X(0,0) to Z(a,0). So the angle between these two lines is angle between vectors XY and XZ.

Vector XY is (a, b), and vector XZ is (a, 0). The angle between them can be found via dot product.

Dot product: (a)(a) + (b)(0) = a².

Magnitude of XY: sqrt(a² + b²).

Magnitude of XZ: sqrt(a² + 0) = a.

So cos(theta) = a² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * a] = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

Which gives theta = arccos[a / sqrt(a² + b²)].

This angle is the angle between diagonal XY and side XZ at point X. Let's denote this angle as angle 1. Given that angle 1 is 30 degrees, so:

arccos[a / sqrt(a² + b²)] = 30°.

Taking cosine of both sides:

a / sqrt(a² + b²) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2.

Squaring both sides:

a² / (a² + b²) = 3/4.

Multiply denominator:

4a² = 3a² + 3b² ⇒ 4a² - 3a² = 3b² ⇒ a² = 3b² ⇒ a = b√3.

So the ratio of a to b is √3 : 1.

Now, going back to triangle XZA. Earlier, we saw that with a = b√3, the sides of triangle XZA are XZ = a, XA = ZA = a. So triangle XZA is equilateral, all angles 60 degrees. But angle 1 was defined as the angle at X between XY and XZ, which is 30 degrees. So how does this fit?

Wait, but if triangle XZA is equilateral, then all its internal angles are 60 degrees. But angle 1 is not an angle of this triangle. Instead, angle 1 is the angle between diagonal XY and side XZ at point X, which is 30 degrees. So this angle is outside of triangle XZA. Therefore, angle 3 might be referring to another angle.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is one of the angles in triangle XZA. Since angle 1 is 30 degrees, and if angle 3 is one of the angles in triangle XZA, which is equilateral, then it would be 60 degrees. But then why is angle 1 given as 30 degrees? Because angle 1 is separate.

Wait, perhaps angle 3 is the angle at point A in triangle XZA. In the equilateral triangle, that angle would be 60 degrees. But angle 1 is 30 degrees, so maybe angle 3 is 60 degrees? But let's verify.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the angle between the diagonal WZ and side ZY at point Z. Earlier, we computed that angle as arctan(a/b) = arctan(√3 / 1) = 60 degrees. So if angle 3 is this angle, then it would be 60 degrees. Given that angle 1 is 30 degrees, this might be the case. 

Let me recap:

If angle 1 is the angle between diagonal XY and side XZ at point X, which we've determined to be 30 degrees, then the ratio of a to b is √3 : 1. Then, the angle between diagonal WZ and side ZY at point Z is arctan(a/b) = arctan(√3) = 60 degrees. So angle 3 might be this angle, which is 60 degrees. Hence, the answer would be option C: 60.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the angle at point A in triangle XZA. But if triangle XZA is equilateral, then all angles are 60 degrees. However, angle 1 is 30 degrees, which is unrelated. So angle 3 could be 60 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle 3 is 60 degrees, corresponding to choice C.
