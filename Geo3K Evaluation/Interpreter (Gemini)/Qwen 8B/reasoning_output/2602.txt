MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to understand all the given information and then figure out how to find the value of x. 

So, we have triangle ABC. The points A, B, and C are defined as points, so they form a triangle. Now, there are several angles mentioned here. Let me note down all the given constraints:

1. Angle at point B, between points A and C: angle(B,A,C). Wait, angles are usually denoted with three points, where the middle point is the vertex. So angle(B,A,C) would actually be the angle at point A, between points B and C? Wait, no. Wait, the notation for angles can be confusing. Let me recall that angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at point Y, formed by points X, Y, Z. So angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A, between points B and C. Similarly, angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, between points A and C. And angle(A,C,B) is the angle at point C, between points A and B. 

Wait, but the problem also mentions RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)). So that means angle(B,A,C) is a right angle. Which, based on the above, is the angle at point A. Wait, hold on. If angle(B,A,C) is a right angle, that would mean the angle at point A is 90 degrees. But then the triangle is stated to be Right(Triangle(A,B,C)), which implies that the triangle is a right-angled triangle. However, depending on which angle is the right angle, the rest of the angles will change. 

But let me check again. Let's clarify each angle:

- Angle(B,A,C): This is the angle at point A between BA and CA. So vertex at A, sides AB and AC. Therefore, angle at A is 90 degrees because it's a right angle.

Then, the triangle is right-angled. Since the right angle is at A, then the hypotenuse would be BC. Then, the other two angles, at B and C, should add up to 90 degrees. 

Now, the problem states MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C),x). That's the measure of angle at B (since angle(A,B,C) is angle at B between A and C). Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B), Mul(2,x)) — that's the measure of angle at C between A and B, which is twice x. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),90) — which is already established as 90 degrees. 

Additionally, the sum of all three angles is 180 degrees. Which makes sense since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180. 

So, putting this together:

Let me denote:

- Angle at A (angle(B,A,C)) = 90°
- Angle at B (angle(A,B,C)) = x
- Angle at C (angle(A,C,B)) = 2x

Therefore, sum of angles:

x + 2x + 90° = 180°

Combine like terms:

3x + 90° = 180°

Subtract 90° from both sides:

3x = 90°

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 30°

So, according to this calculation, x is 30. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 30. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any angles. Let me recheck:

The problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C),x) → angle at B is x.

MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B), Mul(2,x)) → angle at C is 2x.

And angle at A is 90°, as given by RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)).

Yes, that's correct. So adding them gives x + 2x + 90 = 180 ⇒ 3x=90 ⇒ x=30. Therefore, the answer should be C. 

But wait, let me double-check if there's another possibility. For example, could the right angle be at a different vertex? But the problem specifically says RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), which is angle at A. So that's fixed. Hence, the other angles are x and 2x. 

Another way to think: In a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary. So their sum is 90°. Here, those two angles are x and 2x. Thus, x + 2x = 90 ⇒ 3x=90 ⇒ x=30. Yep, same result. 

So the correct answer is C. 30.
