B. 3 \sqrt 2
C. 6
D. 6 \sqrt 2

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a square inscribed in a circle, and the area of the circle is given as 18π. We need to find the length of a side of the square. The answer choices are A through D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me recall some geometry concepts. When a square is inscribed in a circle, all four corners of the square touch the circumference of the circle. That means the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Right? Because the diagonal stretches from one point on the circle through the center to the opposite point, making it the diameter.

So, if I can find the radius of the circle, then I can find the diameter, which would be the diagonal of the square. Then, using the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of the square, I can calculate the side length.

The area of the circle is given as 18π. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², right? So setting that equal to 18π:

πr² = 18π  
Divide both sides by π: r² = 18  
Then take the square root: r = √18  
Simplify √18: √(9*2) = 3√2. So the radius is 3√2. Therefore, the diameter is twice that, which is 6√2. 

Now, since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, the diagonal (d) is 6√2. 

But how does the diagonal relate to the side length (s) of the square? For a square, the diagonal divides it into two right-angled triangles. Using Pythagoras' theorem, the diagonal squared equals the sum of the squares of the sides. So:

d² = s² + s²  
Which simplifies to d² = 2s²  
Therefore, solving for s gives s = d / √2. 

Substituting the value of d:

s = 6√2 / √2  
Wait, the √2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 6. So the side length is 6?

Let me check that again. If the diagonal is 6√2, then dividing by √2 gives 6. Yes, that seems right. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, the diagonal of a square is s√2. Wait, yes! Because if each side is s, then the diagonal is s√2. So if the diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle, which we found to be 6√2, then:

s√2 = 6√2  
Divide both sides by √2: s = 6. 

Yes, that confirms it. So the side length is 6. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 6. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't a miscalculation. Let me go through the steps once more.

Area of circle is 18π. Area formula πr² = 18π ⇒ r²=18 ⇒ r=√18=3√2. Diameter is 2r=6√2. Diagonal of square is diameter, so diagonal is 6√2. Since diagonal of square is s√2, set s√2 = 6√2 ⇒ s=6. Yep, that's consistent. So the correct answer is C, 6. 

Looking at the options, answer C is 6. So the correct choice is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the side length of the square inscribed in the circle, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the square and the circle. Given that the square is **inscribed** in the circle, its **diagonal** coincides with the **diameter** of the circle.

---

### Step 1: Use the Circle’s Area to Find Its Radius

We are told that the area of the circle is $18\pi$. Recall the formula for the area of a circle:

$$
\text{Area} = \pi r^2
$$

Setting this equal to $18\pi$:

$$
\pi r^2 = 18\pi \Rightarrow r^2 = 18 \Rightarrow r = \sqrt{18}
$$

Simplifying $\sqrt{18}$:

$$
\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 2} = 3\sqrt{2}
$$

Thus, the **radius** of the circle is $3\sqrt{2}$, and the **diameter** is:

$$
2r = 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate the Square’s Diagonal to Its Side Length

Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the **diagonal of the square** equals the **diameter of the circle**, which is $6\sqrt{2}$.

For a square, the relationship between the side length ($s$) and the diagonal ($d$) is given by the Pythagorean theorem applied to the triangle formed by two adjacent sides and the diagonal:

$$
d = s\sqrt{2}
$$

Set this equal to the known diagonal:

$$
s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
$$

Dividing both sides by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$
s = 6
$$

---

### Final Result

The side length of the square is therefore:

$$
\boxed{6}
$$

This matches **Answer Choice C**.

### Final Answer: C
