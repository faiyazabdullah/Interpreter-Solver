MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. Let me parse through each part carefully.

We have several geometric elements here:

- Circle(X): So there's a circle centered at point X.
- Points Y and Z are on this circle because PointLiesOnCircle(Y, Circle(X)) and similarly for Z.
- Lines XY and XZ are drawn, which means they connect the center X to points Y and Z on the circumference. Also, since Y and Z are on the circle, these lines should be radii of the circle.
- The angle at X between points Y and Z is given as 75 degrees. That is, ∠YXZ = 75°.
- The length of line XY (which is a radius) is 6 units. Therefore, the radius r of the circle is 6.
- There's an arc from Z to Y, denoted as Arc(Z,Y). We need to find the length of this arc, rounded to the nearest hundredth.

So the question is asking for the length of arc ZY. Since we're dealing with circles, arc length depends on the central angle subtended by the arc and the radius of the circle. The formula for arc length is θ * r, where θ is the central angle in radians. 

First, let's confirm that the arc in question is indeed the minor arc ZY. Given that the central angle is 75°, which is less than 180°, so it's definitely the minor arc. If the angle were greater than 180°, we might consider the major arc, but here it's straightforward.

But wait, the central angle given is ∠YXZ, which is formed by points Y, X, Z. So the angle at the center X between points Y and Z. Therefore, the arc ZY corresponds to this central angle. Hence, the measure of the arc ZY is equal to the measure of the central angle ∠YXZ, which is 75 degrees. However, arc length requires the angle in radians. 

Let me recall the conversion between degrees and radians. Since π radians equals 180 degrees, then 1 degree is π/180 radians. Therefore, converting 75 degrees to radians would be 75 * (π / 180). Simplifying that, we can write it as (75π)/180, which reduces to (5π)/12 radians.

Now, using the arc length formula: arc length = θ * r. Here, θ is 5π/12 radians, and the radius r is 6. So plugging in the numbers:

arc length = (5π/12) * 6

Simplifying this expression:

The 6 in the numerator cancels with the denominator 12, leaving 6/12 = 1/2. So:

arc length = 5π * (1/2) = (5π)/2 ≈ ?

Calculating the numerical value:

π is approximately 3.1416. Multiplying that by 5 gives about 15.708. Then dividing by 2 gives approximately 7.854. Rounding to the nearest hundredth, that's 7.85. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 7.85. 

Wait, let me check again. Did I do that correctly? Let me recalculate:

First, 75 degrees converted to radians is indeed 75*(π/180) = (5π)/12. Then multiplying by radius 6:

(5π/12)*6 = (5π)/2. Yes. 

Then, 5π/2 ≈ 5*3.1416/2 ≈ 15.708/2 ≈ 7.854. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 7.85. So answer choice C is 7.85. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the central angle is 75 degrees? Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)) is 75 degrees. So that's the central angle. So yes, the arc length corresponding to that angle is indeed based on that angle. 

Another way to think: if the radius is 6, circumference is 2πr = 12π. The entire circumference corresponds to 360 degrees. So each degree corresponds to (12π)/360 = π/15 per degree. Therefore, 75 degrees would correspond to 75*(π/15) = 5π. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, hold on! Which is right?

Wait, no. Wait, if the total circumference is 2πr, then the arc length for θ degrees is (θ/360) * 2πr. Alternatively, θ in radians times r. Let me verify both methods.

First method: θ in radians is 5π/12. Multiply by r=6: 5π/12 *6 = 5π/2 ≈ 7.85. 

Second method: Using degrees. 75 degrees out of 360. So arc length is (75/360)*(2π*6) = (75/360)*12π. Simplify 75/360 = 5/24. 5/24 * 12π = (5/2)π. Same as before. So 5π/2 ≈ 7.85. So same result. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 7.85, which is option C. 

Looking back at the answer choices: 

A. 3.93 

B. 6.00 

C. 7.85 

D. 15.71 

Yes, C is 7.85. So the answer should be C. 

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that the central angle is 75 degrees, converting it to radians, applying the arc length formula, and calculating accurately. All steps check out.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of the arc $ \widehat{ZY} $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:
- $ X $ is the center of a circle.
- Points $ Y $ and $ Z $ lie on the circle, i.e., $ Y $ and $ Z $ are on the circumference of the circle centered at $ X $.
- $ \angle YXZ = 75^\circ $, meaning the central angle subtended by arc $ \widehat{ZY} $ is $ 75^\circ $.
- The radius $ r = 6 $, since the segment $ XY $ is a radius of the circle and its length is given as 6.

Thus, the arc $ \widehat{ZY} $ is associated with the central angle $ 75^\circ $, and lies entirely within the circle.

---

### **Step 2: Convert Degrees to Radians**

To apply the arc-length formula, we convert the central angle into radians:

$$
\theta_{\text{radians}} = 75^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{5\pi}{12}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Use the Arc-Length Formula**

The formula for arc length $ L $ is:

$$
L = r \cdot \theta
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
L = 6 \cdot \frac{5\pi}{12} = \frac{30\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{2}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute the Numerical Value**

Use $ \pi \approx 3.1416 $:

$$
L = \frac{5 \cdot 3.1416}{2} = \frac{15.708}{2} \approx 7.854
$$

Rounded to the nearest hundredth:

$$
L \approx 7.85
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of arc $ \widehat{ZY} $ is approximately **7.85**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
