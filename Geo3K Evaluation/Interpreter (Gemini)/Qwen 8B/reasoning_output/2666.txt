MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how to find AB. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting these points: AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, DC, EB. Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,B,E) and Triangle(A,D,C). It's stated that line EB is parallel to DC. Additionally, some lengths are given:

- Length of AD is 4.
- Length of DE is 10.
- Length of BC is 5.
- Length of AB is x - 2 (so we need to find x? Wait, no, AB is expressed as Sub(x,2), which might mean x minus 2. But maybe it's better to think in terms of variables here.)
Wait, but then later they say Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 14). So AE = 14. Also, there's a relation between AE and AD and DE: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,E)))). Since AD is 4 and DE is 10, adding them gives 14, so AE is indeed 14. That checks out.

Then there's similarity between triangles AEB and ADC. The ratio of AE/AD equals AB/AC. Also, another equation says that AC is equal to AB + BC. Since BC is 5, AC = AB + 5.

So let's note down equations:

Let’s denote AB as x. Then according to the given, AB = x - 2? Wait, wait. Wait, the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Sub(x,2)). Hmm, perhaps x is a variable here, but since we're supposed to find AB, maybe x is AB? Or maybe the problem uses x as a variable for AB? Maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using x as a variable such that AB = x - 2. But then we need to find AB, which would involve solving for x. However, the problem also mentions other relationships. Let me try to formalize the variables.

Let me assign variables:

Let AB = y. Then according to the constraint, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Sub(x,2)), which suggests that AB = x - 2. But unless we know x, maybe this isn't helpful yet. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and instead of Sub(x,2), it should be something else. Wait, no, the user input is as written. Maybe x is a variable to solve for?

But let's see. Let me focus on the given equations. We have:

From the triangle similarity: Triangle(A,E,B) ~ Triangle(A,D,C). Therefore, corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of AE / AD = AB / AC. Also, since EB || DC, the triangles are similar by AA similarity because of the parallel lines creating equal angles.

Given that, AE / AD = AB / AC. From earlier, AE is 14, AD is 4. So 14 / 4 = AB / AC → AB / AC = 7 / 2. 

Also, another equation: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C)))). Which means AC = AB + BC. And BC is 5. So AC = AB + 5. Let me write that:

AB = y (let me use y for AB)
AC = y + 5

So substituting into the ratio from the similar triangles:

AE / AD = AB / AC ⇒ 14 / 4 = y / (y + 5)

Cross-multiplying:

14(y + 5) = 4y

Expanding:

14y + 70 = 4y

Subtract 4y both sides:

10y + 70 = 0 ⇒ 10y = -70 ⇒ y = -7. Wait, that can't be right. Lengths can't be negative. Did I make a mistake here?

Hmm. Let me check my steps again. The ratio AE / AD = AB / AC. Wait, maybe I got the correspondence wrong. Because the triangles are similar: Triangle AEB ~ Triangle ADC. Wait, how are the triangles set up?

Original statement: Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)). So triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC. So the order matters. So vertex A corresponds to A, E corresponds to D, and B corresponds to C. Therefore, the sides opposite those vertices would correspond.

In triangle AEB, side AE corresponds to side AD in triangle ADC. Similarly, side AB corresponds to side AC. Wait, let me confirm:

If triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC, then angle at A is common? Wait, but the triangles may not share an angle. Wait, let me think about the structure.

Since EB is parallel to DC, and considering the lines involved. For example, if EB || DC, then angles formed by transversal lines could create similar triangles. Let me visualize.

Assuming point A is connected to B, C, D, E. Lines EB and DC are parallel. So maybe triangle AEB and triangle ADC are similar due to the parallel lines and some angle relations.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So angle at A is common? Not necessarily. Wait, maybe angle between EA and AB equals angle between DA and AC? Not sure. Let me think again.

The key is that the two triangles AEB and ADC are similar. Therefore, their corresponding angles are equal. So angle at A is common? If EB is parallel to DC, then maybe the angles created by the intersection with line AE or something else. Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar via AA similarity because of the parallel lines.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio comes from the sides adjacent to the common angle. Suppose that angle at A is shared between both triangles? Wait, triangle AEB has vertices A, E, B. Triangle ADC has vertices A, D, C. So angle at A is part of both triangles. If lines EB and DC are parallel, then maybe the angles formed at A are equal? Let me imagine: If you have two lines EB and DC parallel, and a transversal cutting through them, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to consider the direction vectors or slopes.

But regardless of the exact configuration, the given similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So the ratio of AE to AD equals the ratio of AB to AC. Which was my initial thought. So AE / AD = AB / AC. Given that AE is 14, AD is 4, so 14/4 = AB / AC. Simplify 14/4 to 7/2. So AB / AC = 7/2. Thus, AB = (7/2) * AC.

But also, from the constraint, AC = AB + BC. Since BC is given as 5, so AC = AB + 5. Let me substitute AB as (7/2)*AC into this equation.

Wait, AB = (7/2) AC. Then AC = AB + 5 becomes:

AC = (7/2) AC + 5

Subtract (7/2) AC from both sides:

AC - (7/2) AC = 5 ⇒ (-5/2) AC = 5 ⇒ AC = 5 * (-2/5) = -2. Again, negative length? That can't be possible. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests that my assumption about which sides correspond in the similar triangles is incorrect.

Ah! This is critical. Maybe the correspondence of the similar triangles is different. Let me re-examine the similarity statement: Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)). So the order of the vertices matters. So Triangle AEB ~ Triangle ADC. So vertex A corresponds to A, E corresponds to D, and B corresponds to C. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles would be AE corresponds to AD, AB corresponds to AC, and EB corresponds to DC.

Therefore, the ratio of AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC. So my previous calculation was correct. But that leads us to a negative value for AC, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the ratio is not AE/AD but AE/DC? Wait no. If triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC, then the correspondence is A→A, E→D, B→C. Therefore, side AE in triangle AEB corresponds to side AD in triangle ADC. Side AB in triangle AEB corresponds to side AC in triangle ADC. Therefore, AE / AD = AB / AC. So same as before.

But that leads to inconsistency. So either the problem has conflicting constraints, or I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Let me redo the algebra. Given AE = 14, AD = 4. So AE / AD = 14 / 4 = 7 / 2. So AB / AC = 7 / 2. Therefore, AB = (7/2) AC. Also, AC = AB + BC. BC is given as 5. So AC = AB + 5. Substitute AB:

AC = (7/2) AC + 5. Subtract (7/2) AC from both sides:

AC - (7/2) AC = 5 ⇒ (-5/2) AC = 5 ⇒ AC = 5 * (-2)/5 = -2. Negative length. Impossible. So something is wrong here.

This suggests that either there's a mistake in interpreting the similar triangles or in the given constraints. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, maybe the similar triangles are Triangle AEB ~ Triangle ADC, but with a different correspondence? For instance, maybe AEB ~ DCA? Or another order? Let me think. If EB || DC, then maybe the triangles are similar in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is A→A, B→D, E→C? Let me try that. So if triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC, then the correspondence could be A→A, E→C, B→D? No, because the second triangle is ADC. Wait, the original triangle is AEB, and the similar triangle is ADC. So the order of the letters defines the correspondence. So A corresponds to A, E corresponds to D, B corresponds to C. So the sides AE corresponds to AD, AB corresponds to AC, and EB corresponds to DC. So the ratio AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC. So my initial approach was correct.

But that leads to negative length. So maybe there's a mistake in another part of the problem? Let me check the given data again.

Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,D)). So point E lies on line AD. Wait, that changes things. Earlier, I thought E was connected to B, but if E lies on AD, then line AE is part of line AD. Wait, but line AD connects A and D, and point E lies on that line. So E is somewhere along AD. But then line EB is drawn from E to B. Also, line DC connects D to C. And EB is parallel to DC.

So with E lying on AD, and EB || DC. Let me sketch mentally: Points A, D, E colinear with E between A and D? Or maybe extended beyond? Let me assume E is between A and D. Wait, but the length of AD is 4, and DE is 10. Wait, if E is on AD, then DE would be part of AD. But AD is 4 units long. How can DE be 10? That would imply that E is outside segment AD, extending past D. So AD is 4 units, and DE is 10 units, meaning that E is located beyond D on the line AD extended. So the total length from A to E would be AD + DE = 4 + 10 = 14, which matches the given AE = 14. So yes, that makes sense. So E is on line AD extended beyond D, making AE = AD + DE = 14. Got it.

Now, with that in mind, let me re-express the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let me place point A at origin (0,0). Since E is on line AD, and AD is 4 units. Let me define coordinate system.

Let me suppose line AD is horizontal for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s set A at (0, 0).

Since AD is 4 units, let me put D at (4, 0). Then E is on line AD extended beyond D. Since DE = 10, then E is at (4 + 10, 0) = (14, 0). Wait, but then AE would be from (0,0) to (14,0), which is length 14. Correct. So coordinates:

A: (0, 0)

D: (4, 0)

E: (14, 0)

Now, line EB is parallel to DC. Let me find coordinates of B and C.

We also have line BC with length 5. Also, AC = AB + 5, from the constraint Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C)))).

Additionally, triangle ABE and triangle ADC are similar.

First, let me note that line EB is parallel to DC. So vector EB is parallel to vector DC.

Let me denote coordinates for B and C. Let me attempt to find coordinates for B and C.

Let me first find coordinates for B. Since line AB is connected to B, and line AE is known. Also, line EB connects E(14,0) to B. Line DC connects D(4,0) to C. These lines are parallel.

Let me assume coordinates for B as (x, y). Then coordinates for C can be determined based on other constraints.

But since we have multiple unknowns, perhaps we can use the similarity condition.

Triangles AEB ~ ADC. As per earlier, but with the corrected understanding that E is on AD. Let me re-examine the similarity.

Given that EB || DC, the triangles AEB and ADC are similar. So the ratio of similarity is AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC.

We already know AE = 14, AD = 4, so ratio is 14 / 4 = 7 / 2. So AB / AC = 7 / 2.

Also, AC = AB + BC. BC is 5. So AC = AB + 5.

Let me call AB = y. Then AC = y + 5.

Thus, AB / AC = y / (y + 5) = 7 / 2.

So cross-multiplying: 2y = 7(y + 5)

=> 2y = 7y + 35

=> -5y = 35 => y = -7. Again, negative value. What's going on here?

This suggests that even with the coordinate setup, we get a negative length. This indicates a fundamental issue. Perhaps my assumption about the correspondence of the similar triangles is incorrect?

Alternative possibility: Maybe the similar triangles are AEB ~ DAC instead of ADC? Let me check the original statement: Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)). So the order is A-E-B vs A-D-C. So the correspondence is A-A, E-D, B-C. Hence, the ratio AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC. Same as before.

But getting negative value. Is there another possibility? Maybe the triangles are not AEB ~ ADC but AEB ~ DCA? Let me check the order. If triangle AEB ~ triangle DCA, then the correspondence would be A→D, E→C, B→A. Then the ratio would be AE/DC = AB/CA = EB/CA. Not sure. Let me try this alternative correspondence.

Suppose triangle AEB ~ triangle DCA. Then:

AE corresponds to DC,

AB corresponds to CA,

EB corresponds to CA.

Wait, but then the ratio would be AE/DC = AB/CA. Let me compute this.

If AE = 14, DC is the length of DC. But DC is not directly given. However, since EB || DC, and from coordinates, maybe we can find DC?

Alternatively, since EB || DC, the slope of EB equals slope of DC.

Let me try to calculate coordinates. Let me proceed with coordinates as follows:

Points:

A: (0, 0)

D: (4, 0)

E: (14, 0)

Let me denote B as (p, q), and C as (r, s).

Line EB connects E(14,0) to B(p,q). Line DC connects D(4,0) to C(r,s). These lines are parallel, so their slopes are equal.

Slope of EB: (q - 0)/(p - 14) = q/(p - 14)

Slope of DC: (s - 0)/(r - 4) = s/(r - 4)

Since they are parallel, q/(p - 14) = s/(r - 4)

Also, line AB connects A(0,0) to B(p,q). So AB has length sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = y, which we denoted as AB = y.

Similarly, AC connects A(0,0) to C(r,s), so its length is sqrt(r² + s²) = AC = y + 5.

Also, BC connects B(p,q) to C(r,s), length is 5. So sqrt[(r-p)² + (s - q)²] = 5.

Moreover, triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC. Assuming the correspondence A-E-B ~ A-D-C, leading to AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC.

But earlier that led to negative values. However, if we take another correspondence, like A-E-B ~ D-C-A, then the ratios would change. Let me explore that possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the similar triangles are AEB ~ CDA? Let me think about the correspondence. If triangle AEB ~ triangle CDA, then the correspondence would be A→C, E→D, B→A. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe triangle AEB ~ triangle DCA, which would mean A→D, E→C, B→A. In this case, the ratio would be AE/DC = AB/CA = EB/CA.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the angles match. Given that EB || DC, the angle at A in triangle AEB corresponds to the angle at D in triangle DCA? Not sure. Maybe this is too vague without a diagram.

Alternatively, maybe I should use vectors or parametric equations.

Another idea: Since EB || DC, the vector EB is scalar multiple of DC.

Vector EB = B - E = (p - 14, q - 0) = (p - 14, q)

Vector DC = C - D = (r - 4, s - 0) = (r - 4, s)

Since they are parallel, there exists k such that (p - 14, q) = k*(r - 4, s). So p - 14 = k*(r - 4), and q = k*s.

Also, from the similarity of triangles AEB and ADC. Let me recall that the similarity requires not only the sides being in proportion but also angles matching. Given that EB || DC, the corresponding angles are equal, hence the similarity.

But still, the earlier equations lead to contradictions. Maybe I need to use the fact that AC = AB + BC and the ratio from similarity.

Let me go back to the equation where AB / AC = 7/2, but that gave negative result. Perhaps there's a mistake in assuming AE/AD = AB/AC. Maybe it's AE/DC = AB/AC? Let me think. If the triangles are similar, then the ratio depends on which sides correspond.

If triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC, then AE corresponds to AD, AB corresponds to AC, and EB corresponds to DC. Hence, AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC. So AE/AD = 14/4 = 7/2. So AB/AC = 7/2. But this led to negative AC. So unless there's a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation.

Wait, but maybe the ratio is AB/AC = AE/DC. If that were the case, then AB/AC = AE/DC. But I don't know DC's length. Let me think. If I can express DC in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, and from the vector relationship above, vector EB = k*vector DC. So |EB| = |k| * |DC|. Also, from the similarity, if the triangles are similar, then AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC. So if I can find |EB| and |DC|, I can relate them.

But we know AE = 14, AD = 4. So AE/AD = 7/2 = EB/DC. So EB = (7/2) DC.

But also, from the vector relationship, EB = k*DC. So |EB| = |k| * |DC|, so (7/2) DC = |k| DC → |k| = 7/2. So the magnitude of k is 7/2. But this doesn't give direct info on DC.

However, we can also look at the length of EB. Let me try to compute EB in terms of coordinates. EB is from E(14,0) to B(p,q). Its length is sqrt[(p - 14)^2 + q^2]. Also, DC is from D(4,0) to C(r,s), length sqrt[(r - 4)^2 + s^2].

But without knowing coordinates of B and C, this is challenging.

Let me try to use the fact that AC = AB + BC. Let me denote AB = y, so AC = y + 5.

Also, from the similarity ratio, AB/AC = 7/2 → y / (y + 5) = 7/2 → 2y = 7y + 35 → -5y = 35 → y = -7. Still negative. This suggests that either the problem has conflicting constraints or I have misapplied the similarity.

Wait, perhaps the similar triangles are not AEB ~ ADC but AEB ~ CDB or something else? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is between AEB and DBC? Not sure. Let me re-examine the problem statement: Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)). So it's definitely AEB ~ ADC.

At this point, I'm stuck with the negative value. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I missed a constraint?

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 14). We've used that AE = 14. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 4), so AD = 4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), 10), which we've used to determine E is on AD extended, giving AE = AD + DE = 4 + 10 = 14.

Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 5). So BC = 5.

Other constraints: IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,E)) — which is true since AB is a side of the triangle. Same for others.

Maybe I should consider that AB is not just a straight line but involves other constraints. Let me try to use coordinates again.

Let me assume coordinates for B and C.

Let me set A at (0,0), D at (4,0), E at (14,0).

Let me assume that line EB is parallel to DC. Let me denote coordinates for B as (x, y), and for C as (a, b). 

Since line EB is parallel to DC, their slopes are equal. So slope of EB = (y - 0)/(x - 14) = y/(x - 14). Slope of DC = (b - 0)/(a - 4) = b/(a - 4). So y/(x - 14) = b/(a - 4).

Also, BC has length 5: sqrt[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2] = 5.

Also, AC = AB + 5. AB is sqrt(x² + y²), AC is sqrt(a² + b²). So sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(x² + y²) + 5.

Also, from the similarity of triangles AEB and ADC. Let me assume that the similarity ratio is AE/AD = 14/4 = 7/2. So the ratio of similarity is 7/2. So all sides of triangle AEB are 7/2 times the corresponding sides of triangle ADC.

So, for example, AE corresponds to AD. So AE = 7/2 * AD → 14 = 7/2 * 4 → 14 = 14, which holds. Next, AB corresponds to AC. So AB = 7/2 * AC. But AB is sqrt(x² + y²), AC is sqrt(a² + b²). So sqrt(x² + y²) = (7/2) * sqrt(a² + b²).

But also, AC = AB + 5 → sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(x² + y²) + 5.

Let me denote AB = y_val = sqrt(x² + y²), AC = z_val = sqrt(a² + b²). Then:

z_val = y_val + 5

and 

y_val = (7/2) z_val

Substituting z_val = y_val + 5 into the second equation:

y_val = (7/2)(y_val + 5)

Multiply both sides by 2:

2y_val = 7y_val + 35

→ -5y_val = 35 → y_val = -7

Again, negative. So this suggests inconsistency. What's the issue?

Perhaps the similarity is in reverse? Like triangle AEB ~ triangle CDA, so that the ratio is AE/CD = AB/CA. Let me try this. If the similarity is AEB ~ CDA, then AE corresponds to CD, AB corresponds to CA, and EB corresponds to DA.

So AE/CD = AB/CA = EB/DA.

Given that, let's compute AE = 14, DA = AD = 4. So AE/CD = 14/CD = AB/CA. Also, EB/DA = EB/4.

But we don't know EB or CD. Let's try to express these.

But we also have AC = AB + 5.

Let me denote AB = y, CA = z = y + 5.

From similarity, AE/CD = AB/CA → 14/CD = y/z → CD = 14z/y.

Also, EB/DA = EB/4 = AB/CA = y/z → EB = 4y/z.

But we also have from the vector relationship: EB is parallel to DC. So vector EB = k * vector DC.

Let me try to express DC. Vector DC is from D(4,0) to C(a,b): (a - 4, b). Vector EB is from E(14,0) to B(x,y): (x - 14, y). So (x - 14, y) = k*(a - 4, b).

So x - 14 = k(a - 4), y = k*b.

Also, length of EB is sqrt[(x - 14)^2 + y^2] = |k| * sqrt[(a - 4)^2 + b^2] = |k| * DC.

From earlier, EB = 4y/z. And DC = 14z/y.

So |k| * DC = EB → |k| * (14z/y) = 4y/z → |k| = (4y/z) / (14z/y) = (4y^2)/(14z^2) = (2y^2)/(7z^2).

But also, from the vector components:

x - 14 = k(a - 4), and y = k*b → k = y/b.

So substituting k = y/b into |k| = 2y²/(7z²):

|y/b| = 2y²/(7z²) → 1/|b| = 2y/(7z²) → |b| = 7z²/(2y).

This seems complex, but maybe we can find relations between variables.

We also know that AC = z = sqrt(a² + b²) = y + 5.

And AB = y = sqrt(x² + y²) → Wait, AB is sqrt(x² + y²)? Wait, no: AB is from A(0,0) to B(x,y), so yes, AB = sqrt(x² + y²) = y_val.

But earlier, I used y_val = y, which might conflict with the coordinate y. Let me clarify notation: Let me rename AB = y_val = sqrt(x² + y²), where x and y are coordinates of B.

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try plugging in the relations.

We have z = y_val + 5, and from similarity, AE/CD = y_val/z → CD = (AE * z)/y_val = (14 * z)/y_val.

Also, from vector relationship, DC = sqrt[(a - 4)^2 + b^2] = CD.

But also, from the expression of |b| = 7z²/(2y_val).

Let me try to combine these equations.

Let me assume that k is positive, so k = y/b. From x - 14 = k(a - 4) → x = 14 + k(a - 4).

But I also have BC = 5. BC is from B(x,y) to C(a,b), so:

sqrt[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2] = 5.

Let me square both sides:

(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2 = 25.

But x = 14 + k(a - 4), so a - x = a - 14 - k(a - 4) = a(1 - k) - 14 + 4k.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let me consider specific values. Since AB is what we need to find, and the answer choices are numerical, maybe we can guess and check.

The answer choices are A. 5, B. 7.5, C. 9.5, D. 10.

Let me test option B: AB = 7.5. Let's see if this works.

If AB = 7.5, then AC = AB + BC = 7.5 + 5 = 12.5.

From similarity, AE/AD = AB/AC → 14/4 = 7.5 / 12.5 → 3.5 = 0.6? No, 14/4 is 3.5, and 7.5/12.5 is 0.6. Not equal. So this doesn't work.

Option D: AB = 10. Then AC = 10 + 5 = 15. Check 14/4 = 10/15 → 3.5 = 0.666... No.

Option C: AB = 9.5 → AC = 9.5 + 5 = 14.5. 14/4 = 3.5, 9.5/14.5 ≈ 0.655. Still not equal.

Option A: AB = 5 → AC = 5 + 5 = 10. 14/4 = 3.5, 5/10 = 0.5. Not equal.

None of these satisfy the ratio 14/4 = 7/2 = AB/AC. This suggests that there is no solution among the given options, which contradicts the problem statement. But since the problem asks to select one, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let me revisit the similarity. If the triangles are AEB ~ ADC, and the ratio is AE/AD = AB/AC, but this leads to negative values, but maybe the ratio is AE/DC = AB/AC? Let me try that.

If AE/DC = AB/AC, then 14/DC = AB/AC. Also, from the parallel lines, since EB || DC, the triangles might have some relationship.

But we also know that AC = AB + BC = AB + 5.

Let me denote AB = y, AC = y + 5.

So 14/DC = y/(y + 5) → DC = 14(y + 5)/y.

Also, from the parallel lines, since EB || DC, the triangles might have some relation. Let me consider the vector approach again.

Vector EB = (x - 14, y), vector DC = (a - 4, b). They are parallel, so (x - 14)/ (a - 4) = y / b = k.

Also, length of EB = |k| * length of DC.

Length of EB = sqrt((x - 14)^2 + y^2) = |k| * sqrt((a - 4)^2 + b^2).

But also, DC = sqrt((a - 4)^2 + b^2) = 14(y + 5)/y.

So, length of EB = |k| * 14(y + 5)/y.

But also, length of EB can be expressed as sqrt((x - 14)^2 + y^2). But without knowing x and y, this is difficult.

Alternatively, from the vector relationship, (x - 14) = k(a - 4), y = k*b. So x = 14 + k(a - 4), and y = k*b.

Also, BC has length 5: distance between B(x,y) and C(a,b) is 5.

So sqrt[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2] = 5.

Substitute x = 14 + k(a - 4), y = k*b:

a - x = a - 14 - k(a - 4) = a(1 - k) - 14 + 4k.

b - y = b - k*b = b(1 - k).

So squared distance:

[a(1 - k) - 14 + 4k]^2 + [b(1 - k)]^2 = 25.

This is complex, but perhaps we can find k from elsewhere.

Also, from AC = sqrt(a² + b²) = y + 5. And AB = sqrt(x² + y²) = y_val.

But x = 14 + k(a - 4), and y = k*b.

So AB = sqrt([14 + k(a - 4)]^2 + (k*b)^2) = y_val.

But this seems too many variables. Perhaps there's another relation.

Let me think: Since EB || DC, and from the vector relationship, EB = k*DC. So |EB| = |k| * |DC|.

But also, from the similarity, if we assumed AE/DC = AB/AC, then |EB| = |k| * |DC| = (from earlier) |k| * 14(y + 5)/y.

But also, from the similarity, if the triangles are similar, then the ratio of EB/DC = AB/AC = y/(y + 5).

Wait, if the similarity is AEB ~ ADC, then EB/DC = AB/AC = y/(y + 5). Also, from the vector relationship, |EB| = |k| * |DC|. So |k| = |EB| / |DC| = (y/(y + 5)).

But from the vector relationship, k = y/b (since y = k*b → k = y/b). So |k| = |y| / |b| = y/(y + 5). So |y| / |b| = y/(y + 5). Assuming y > 0 (length), then |y| = y, so y / |b| = y/(y + 5) → |b| = y + 5.

So |b| = y + 5.

Also, from AC = sqrt(a² + b²) = y + 5. So sqrt(a² + b²) = y + 5. But |b| = y + 5. So sqrt(a² + (y + 5)^2) = y + 5 → this implies a = 0. Because sqrt(a² + (y+5)^2) = y + 5 → a² + (y+5)^2 = (y+5)^2 → a = 0.

So a = 0. So point C has x-coordinate 0. So C is at (0, b). But since AC is from A(0,0) to C(0, b), so AC is vertical line. But then DC is from D(4,0) to C(0, b). Let me compute DC.

Coordinates of D(4,0), C(0, b). So vector DC is (-4, b). Length of DC is sqrt(16 + b²). But from earlier, |b| = y + 5, so DC = sqrt(16 + (y + 5)^2).

Also, from the similarity ratio, EB/DC = y/(y + 5). Let me compute EB.

Vector EB is from E(14,0) to B(x, y). But from earlier, x = 14 + k(a - 4). Since a = 0, x = 14 + k(-4) = 14 - 4k. Also, y = k*b. And since |b| = y + 5, let's say b = y + 5 (assuming b positive for simplicity).

So y = k*b = k(y + 5) → y = k(y + 5) → k = y / (y + 5).

So x = 14 - 4k = 14 - 4[y/(y + 5)].

Now, let's compute EB's length: sqrt[(x - 14)^2 + y^2] = sqrt[(-4k)^2 + y^2] = sqrt[16k² + y²].

From the similarity, EB/DC = y/(y + 5). So:

sqrt[16k² + y²]/sqrt(16 + (y + 5)^2) = y/(y + 5).

Square both sides:

[16k² + y²] / [16 + (y + 5)^2] = y²/(y + 5)^2.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

16k² + y² = [y²/(y + 5)^2] * [16 + (y + 5)^2]

Expand the right side:

y²/ (y+5)^2 * [16 + y² + 10y + 25] = y²/ (y+5)^2 * [y² + 10y + 41]

So:

16k² + y² = y²(y² + 10y + 41) / (y + 5)^2

But k = y/(y + 5), so k² = y²/(y + 5)^2.

Substitute k²:

16 * [y²/(y + 5)^2] + y² = y²(y² + 10y + 41) / (y + 5)^2

Multiply both sides by (y + 5)^2 to eliminate denominators:

16y² + y²(y + 5)^2 = y²(y² + 10y + 41)

Expand left side:

16y² + y²(y² + 10y + 25) = 16y² + y^4 + 10y³ + 25y² = y^4 + 10y³ + 41y²

Right side: y²(y² + 10y + 41) = y^4 + 10y³ + 41y²

So both sides are equal. This means our assumptions are consistent, but it doesn't help us find y. This suggests that there are infinitely many solutions, which contradicts the problem having a unique answer. This indicates that there's missing information or that the problem has infinite solutions, but since the answer choices are fixed, perhaps there's another constraint I haven't used.

Wait, let's recall that BC = 5. Point B is at (x, y) = (14 - 4k, y), and point C is at (0, b) = (0, y + 5).

So BC is from B(14 - 4k, y) to C(0, y + 5). The distance between these points is 5.

Compute BC² = (0 - (14 - 4k))^2 + [(y + 5) - y]^2 = (14 - 4k)^2 + (5)^2 = 25.

So:

(14 - 4k)^2 + 25 = 25 → (14 - 4k)^2 = 0 → 14 - 4k = 0 → k = 14/4 = 3.5.

But earlier, k = y/(y + 5). So:

y/(y + 5) = 3.5 = 7/2.

Solving for y:

y = (7/2)(y + 5)

Multiply both sides by 2:

2y = 7y + 35

→ -5y = 35 → y = -7.

Again, negative value. This suggests that under these conditions, there is no valid solution with positive lengths. But the problem states that such a configuration exists, so there must be a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, but if k = 3.5, and k = y/(y + 5), then y = 3.5(y + 5) → y = 3.5y + 17.5 → -2.5y = 17.5 → y = -7. So this is the same result. This suggests that the only solution is y = -7, which is invalid. 

This implies that the given constraints are contradictory, but since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me review the problem statement once more.

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 14). We have AE = 14. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 4), so AD = 4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), 10), so DE = 10. So AE = AD + DE = 4 + 10 = 14, which is correct.

Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Sub(x,2)). Wait, this might be the key. Previously, I assumed AB = y, but maybe this is a clue. Let me re-express this.

The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Sub(x,2)). This likely means AB = x - 2. So x is a variable, and AB = x - 2. But we need to find AB, so if we can find x, we can get AB. Let me try this approach.

Let me redefine variables: Let AB = x - 2. Then, from the earlier similarity, we had AB/AC = 7/2, and AC = AB + 5. So AC = (x - 2) + 5 = x + 3.

So AB/AC = (x - 2)/(x + 3) = 7/2.

Cross-multiplying: 2(x - 2) = 7(x + 3)

→ 2x - 4 = 7x + 21

→ -5x = 25 → x = -5.

So AB = x - 2 = -5 - 2 = -7. Again, negative. This suggests that the problem has inconsistent constraints, but since the answer must be chosen from the options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my interpretation.

Wait, but maybe the Sub(x,2) is meant to represent subtraction, but x is a length, so it must be positive. This suggests that the problem might have a typo, and the intended expression was Add(x,2) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the equality is LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = x - 2, and we need to find x, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses x as a parameter, and the answer is derived from the equations despite the negative value, taking absolute value? If AB = -7, but length cannot be negative, maybe the actual length is 7, which is not in the options. The closest option is B. 7.5. Or maybe I made a sign error.

Wait, if AB = -7, but length is positive, maybe the actual value is 7. Let me check if 7 is close to any option. The options are 5, 7.5, 9.5, 10. 7 is closer to 7.5 than to 5. So if the correct answer is 7, the closest option is B. 7.5. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio was flipped. If instead of AB/AC = 7/2, it's AC/AB = 7/2. Let me try that. Assume AC/AB = 7/2. Then AC = (7/2)AB. But AC = AB + 5. So:

(7/2)AB = AB + 5 → (7/2 - 1)AB = 5 → (5/2)AB = 5 → AB = 2. But 2 is not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is EB/DC = 7/2. But without knowing EB or DC, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, and the fact that the closest option to the negative value (which suggests AB = 7) is B. 7.5, I'll choose B as the answer, assuming there might be a typo in the problem or a sign error.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and leveraging the given relationships between segments and triangles. Here's a structured breakdown of the process:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Variables**
Let’s define:
- $ AB = x - 2 $
- $ AD = 4 $
- $ DE = 10 \Rightarrow AE = AD + DE = 14 $
- $ BC = 5 $

From the triangle similarity:
$$
\text{Similarity: } \triangle AEB \sim \triangle ADC
$$
By the property of similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant:
$$
\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
$$
Substitute known values:
$$
\frac{14}{4} = \frac{x - 2}{AC} \Rightarrow \frac{7}{2} = \frac{x - 2}{AC}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use Additional Constraint**
We are also told:
$$
AC = AB + BC \Rightarrow AC = (x - 2) + 5 = x + 3
$$

Substitute into the similarity ratio:
$$
\frac{7}{2} = \frac{x - 2}{x + 3}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
7(x + 3) = 2(x - 2)
\Rightarrow 7x + 21 = 2x - 4
\Rightarrow 5x = -25 \Rightarrow x = -5
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute AB**
Recall:
$$
AB = x - 2 = -5 - 2 = -7
$$

While the computed value is negative, which is physically meaningless for a length, this suggests a potential inconsistency in the problem setup or a misinterpretation of the constraints. However, since the question asks to **select the closest** answer from the given choices, we interpret the magnitude of the computed value.

---

### **Step 4: Choose Closest Option**

The computed value is $ |-7| = 7 $. Among the choices:
- A. 5  
- B. 7.5  
- C. 9.5  
- D. 10  

The closest value to 7 is **7.5**, which corresponds to **option B**.

---

**Final Answer: B**
