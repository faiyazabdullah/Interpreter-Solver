====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out all the given points and relationships.

We have a circle with center X. Points Y, Z, V, W lie on this circle. So, X is the center, and Y, Z, V, W are points on the circumference. 

Then there are lines drawn between these points: Line(Y,X), Line(X,V), Line(Z,X), Line(X,W). Also, it says that Line(Y,V) is a diameter of the circle, as well as Line(Z,W). Wait, but since X is the center, if Line(Y,V) is a diameter, then Y and V must be endpoints of a diameter. Similarly for Z and W. But wait, since X is the center, then the line connecting Y and V would pass through X? Because diameters go through the center. Let me confirm that. Yes, a diameter of a circle passes through the center, so if Line(Y,V) is a diameter, then X must be the midpoint of YV. Similarly for ZW.

So, Line(Y,V) is a diameter, meaning X is the midpoint of YV. Therefore, YX = XV, right? Since X is the center. Same with ZW: X is the midpoint of ZW. So, ZX = XW.

Now, we have arcs: Arc(Y,Z) and Arc(V,W). The measure of arc YZ is given as 4x + 15 degrees, and the measure of arc VW (I think they mean arc V to W?) is 2x + 65 degrees. Wait, the question mentions Arc(V,W), so that's the arc from V to W. But since V and W are both points on the circle, and since ZW is a diameter, maybe there's some relationship here?

Also, angles at point X: Angle(Y,X,Z) and Angle(V,X,W). It says that the measure of angle YXZ equals the measure of arc YZ, and similarly for angle VXW equals arc VW. Then, it also states that these two angles are equal. So, MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)) = MeasureOf(Angle(V,X,W)). Which implies that the measures of arcs YZ and VW are equal? Wait, no, because each angle is equal to its corresponding arc. Wait, let me check:

The problem states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)), MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z))) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,X,W)), MeasureOf(Arc(V,W))). Then, it also says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)), MeasureOf(Angle(V,X,W))). So combining these, MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) = MeasureOf(Arc(V,W)). Therefore, 4x + 15 = 2x + 65. Solving for x would give us the value of x. Once we find x, we can compute the measure of arc VW, which is equal to angle VXW. So, that seems like the way to go.

Let me write down that equation:

4x + 15 = 2x + 65

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives 2x + 15 = 65

Then subtract 15: 2x = 50 => x = 25.

Therefore, substituting back into MeasureOf(Arc(V,W)) = 2x + 65 = 2*25 + 65 = 50 + 65 = 115 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle VXW is 115 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 115. So the answer should be C.

But let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me double-check the steps.

First, confirming that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, in this case, angle YXZ is formed by two chords: XY and XZ. Wait, but since X is the center, angle YXZ is actually a central angle. Wait, hold on! If X is the center, then angle YXZ is a central angle intercepting arc YZ. Therefore, the measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of the arc. So the problem statement says that MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)) equals MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)), which makes sense because central angles equal their intercepted arcs. Similarly for angle VXW being equal to arc VW. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that the angle was equal to the arc, but then why does the problem state that? Because normally, an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc. But here, since X is the center, angle YXZ is a central angle, so yes, it's equal to the arc measure. Therefore, the measure of angle YXZ is equal to the measure of arc YZ, which is given as 4x + 15. Similarly for angle VXW. And since those two angles are equal, their respective arcs must be equal. Hence, equating them gives 4x + 15 = 2x + 65, leading to x=25. Then arc VW is 2x+65= 115°, which is the measure of angle VXW. So the answer is 115, which is option C. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, but let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, perhaps the arcs mentioned are not the arcs subtended by the points directly, but something else. But according to the problem, Arc(Y,Z) is defined, so that's the arc from Y to Z along the circle. Similarly for Arc(V,W). Given that Y and Z are points on the circle, and since X is the center, the arc YZ would correspond to the central angle YXZ. Therefore, the measure of arc YZ is equal to the measure of angle YXZ. Similarly for arc VW and angle VXW. 

Another thing to check: the fact that YV and ZW are diameters. Since YV is a diameter, then V is diametrically opposite Y. Similarly, W is diametrically opposite Z. So, if you consider the circle, then points Y and V are ends of a diameter, so they're separated by 180 degrees. Similarly for Z and W. Now, considering the arcs YZ and VW. Let me imagine the circle with center X. Suppose we have points Y and V as endpoints of a diameter. Then, point Z is somewhere on the circle such that arc YZ is 4x +15, and arc VW is 2x +65. But since V is the endpoint of diameter YV, then moving from V to W along the circle... Hmm, but how does arc VW relate to other arcs?

Alternatively, maybe there's more structure here. For instance, since ZW is a diameter, then Z and W are endpoints of another diameter. So, if we connect Z and W, that's another diameter. So, points Y and V are on one diameter, Z and W on another. The lines YX, XZ, etc., are radii. 

But maybe this isn't necessary for solving the problem. The key equations seem to be the equality of the two arc measures leading to x=25, hence angle VXW is 115 degrees. 

But just to ensure there's no mistake in the algebra:

Given 4x +15 = 2x +65

Subtract 2x: 2x +15 =65

Subtract 15: 2x=50 → x=25. Correct.

Thus, arc VW is 2x +65 = 2*25 +65= 50+65=115. Therefore, angle VXW is 115 degrees. So answer is C.

But wait, let me check if there's any possibility that the arc measure is supposed to be the minor arc or major arc. For example, if the arc YZ is a major arc, but in that case, the central angle would be greater than 180. However, since Y and Z are points on the circle connected via lines XY and XZ, which are radii, unless specified otherwise, the arc YZ would refer to the minor arc. However, depending on the positions of the points, maybe the arc could be major. However, since the problem gives specific expressions for the arc measures, and when we solved for x, we get a positive number. Let me see: if x=25, then arc YZ is 4*25 +15=115 degrees, and arc VW is 2*25 +65=115 degrees. So both arcs are 115 degrees, which is possible as minor arcs. But if the arc were major, then the measure would be 360 minus the minor arc. However, since the problem didn't specify, but in standard problems, arc measures are typically considered as the smaller arc unless stated otherwise. Therefore, assuming that the arcs given are the minor ones, the calculation holds. Thus, angle VXW is 115 degrees, so answer is C. 

Another check: suppose that the sum of the arcs YZ and VW relates to the total circle. But since they are separate arcs, unless they are parts of the same circle. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, since we only needed to set up the equation based on the given equality of the angles, which led us to x=25, and thus the measure of arc VW is 115 degrees, which corresponds to angle VXW. Therefore, answer C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle V X W $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric relationships and applying fundamental theorems related to circles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Circle Configuration**

- We are told that all points $ Y, Z, V, W $ lie on a circle centered at $ X $. This means that segments $ XY, XZ, XV, XW $ are all radii of the circle.
- Additionally, it is given that:
  - Line $ YV $ is a **diameter**, so $ Y $ and $ V $ are endpoints of a straight line passing through the center $ X $.
  - Line $ ZW $ is also a **diameter**, so $ Z $ and $ W $ are also endpoints of a straight line through $ X $.
  
This tells us that both $ YV $ and $ ZW $ are straight lines through the center, i.e., **central axes** of the circle.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Angles and Arcs**

We are given the following key facts:

- $ \text{Measure}(\angle YXZ) = \text{Measure}(arc\ YZ) $
- $ \text{Measure}(\angle V X W) = \text{Measure}(arc\ VW) $
- $ \text{Measure}(\angle YXZ) = \text{Measure}(\angle V X W) $

From this, we conclude:
$$
\text{Measure}(arc\ YZ) = \text{Measure}(arc\ VW)
$$

We are also given explicit expressions for these arc measures:
- $ \text{Measure}(arc\ YZ) = 4x + 15 $
- $ \text{Measure}(arc\ VW) = 2x + 65 $

Setting these equal:
$$
4x + 15 = 2x + 65
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
4x + 15 = 2x + 65 \\
\Rightarrow 2x = 50 \\
\Rightarrow x = 25
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute the Measure of $ \angle V X W $**

Since $ \angle V X W $ is equal to the measure of arc $ VW $, substitute $ x = 25 $ into the expression for arc $ VW $:

$$
\text{Measure}(arc\ VW) = 2x + 65 = 2(25) + 65 = 50 + 65 = 115^\circ
$$

Hence,
$$
\text{Measure}(\angle V X W) = 115^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle V X W $ is $ 115^\circ $, which matches **Answer Choice C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
