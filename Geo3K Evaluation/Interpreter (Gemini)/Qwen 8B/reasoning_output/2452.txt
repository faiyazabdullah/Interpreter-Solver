Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given points and lines. Let me list out all the information provided:

Points: A, B, C, D, E.

Lines:
- AB
- BC
- CE
- EA
- CD
- ED

Triangles mentioned:
- Triangle BCE (points B, C, E)
- Triangle CDE (points C, D, E)
- Triangle ABE (points A, B, E)

Angles labeled 1 through 9, with measures given for angles 1, 2, 3 as 58°, 47°, 26° respectively. Also, there are some equalities between angles and sums that add up to 180°.

First, since there are parallel lines AB and CE, that suggests maybe some alternate interior angles or corresponding angles could be involved. But I need to figure out which angles those would be.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch mentally. Points A, B connected by line AB; then B to C, C to E, E back to A. So quadrilateral ABCE? Wait, but also point D connected to C and E. So D is connected to both C and E, forming triangle CDE. Also, there's line ED. Hmm.

Given the triangles mentioned: BCE, CDE, ABE. So triangle BCE has vertices B, C, E. Triangle CDE has C, D, E. Triangle ABE has A, B, E.

Now, angles:

Measure of angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, angle 3 is 26°. Then there are equalities involving these angles. For example, measure of angle 1 equals measure of angle 6, so angle 6 is also 58°. Then another equality says sum of angles 3, 4, 5, 6 equals 180°. And another sum of angles 3, 4, and angle BEC (which is angle at E in triangle BCE) equals 180°.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(B,E,C). That's angle at E in triangle BCE, right? Because the middle letter is E. So angle BEC is part of triangle BCE.

So let's note down:

Given:

m∠1 = 58°, m∠2 = 47°, m∠3 = 26°.

Also,

m∠1 = m∠6 → ∠6 = 58°.

Sum of ∠3 + ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 = 180°.

And Sum of ∠3 + ∠4 + ∠BEC = 180°.

Therefore, substituting ∠BEC into the second equation?

Wait, let's think about triangle BCE. In triangle BCE, the three angles are at B, C, E. The angles are:

At B: angle ABC? Or wait, the triangle is BCE, so angles are at B, C, E. Wait, angle at B would be angle EBC, angle at C is angle ECB, and angle at E is angle BEC.

But how do we relate these to the given angles?

Alternatively, maybe some of the given angles (∠1, ∠2, ∠3) correspond to parts of these triangles?

The problem also mentions that lines AB and CE are parallel. So AB || CE.

Since AB || CE, and considering transversal lines, perhaps?

For instance, if there is a transversal cutting AB and CE, creating corresponding angles. But which transversal? Maybe line BE or something else?

Alternatively, looking at triangle ABE and triangle CEB? Since AB is parallel to CE, maybe there's some similarity or congruence?

Wait, but first, let's consider the angles given. Let me try to assign labels to each angle.

Assuming that angles 1, 2, 3 are specific angles in the diagram. However, without seeing the exact figure, it's a bit challenging, but maybe we can deduce based on the triangles and the parallel lines.

Let me try to label the angles step by step.

First, let's look at triangle BCE. Its angles are at B, C, E. Let's denote them as follows:

- At vertex B: angle EBC
- At vertex C: angle ECB
- At vertex E: angle BEC

Similarly, triangle CDE has angles at C, D, E:

- At C: angle DCE
- At D: angle CDE
- At E: angle CED

Triangle ABE has angles at A, B, E:

- At A: angle BAE
- At B: angle ABE
- At E: angle AEB

Additionally, there's line CD connecting C to D, and line ED connecting E to D. So D is connected to C and E, making triangle CDE.

Also, AB || CE. So lines AB and CE are parallel. Therefore, any transversal intersecting them will create corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc.

Let me try to find relationships using the parallel lines AB || CE.

Suppose we take line BE as a transversal. Since AB || CE, then the angles formed by BE with AB and CE might have relations.

But angle at B (from AB) and angle at E (from CE) could be related. Alternatively, if we take line BC as a transversal?

Alternatively, maybe line AE? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CE, then angles made by a transversal like EC and AB... Wait, maybe angle at B (in triangle ABE) and angle at E (in triangle BCE)?

Wait, suppose we consider line BE. If AB is parallel to CE, then the angles formed by BE with AB and CE would be same-side interior angles? Wait, AB || CE, and BE is a transversal. Therefore, the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. So angle at B (between AB and BE) and angle at E (between CE and BE) would add up to 180 degrees.

But angle at B between AB and BE is part of triangle ABE, and angle at E between CE and BE is part of triangle BCE.

But I don't know their measures yet. However, maybe we can use this relationship later.

Now, let's see the given angles:

MeasureOf(Angle(1))=58°, MeasureOf(Angle(2))=47°, MeasureOf(Angle(3))=26°. These angles are probably parts of the triangles or related to the parallel lines.

Additionally, there's Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))) meaning that angle 6 is 58°, same as angle 1.

Then, the sum of angles 3, 4, 5, 6 equals 180°. Also, sum of angles 3, 4, and angle BEC equals 180°.

So, since angles 3, 4, and angle BEC sum to 180°, and angles 3, 4, 5, 6 sum to 180°, then angle BEC must equal angle 5 + angle 6?

Because:

From the first equation:

3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 180

From the second equation:

3 + 4 + BEC = 180

Therefore, subtracting the two equations:

(3 + 4 + 5 + 6) - (3 + 4 + BEC) = 0 => 5 + 6 - BEC = 0 => BEC = 5 + 6.

Thus, angle BEC equals angle 5 plus angle 6. Since angle 6 is 58°, then angle BEC = angle 5 + 58°.

But angle BEC is part of triangle BCE. Let's recall that in triangle BCE, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

angle at B (EBC) + angle at C (ECB) + angle BEC = 180°

If we can express angle EBC or angle ECB in terms of known angles, we can find angle BEC.

Alternatively, maybe angle BEC relates to other angles via the parallel lines.

Earlier thought: AB || CE, and line BE is a transversal. Therefore, angle between AB and BE (at B) and angle between CE and BE (at E) are supplementary. Let's call angle at B as x and angle at E as y. So x + y = 180°.

But angle at B (x) is part of triangle ABE. Similarly, angle at E (y) is angle BEC (since BE connects to E and CE).

Wait, no. If BE is the transversal, then angle at B (on AB) and angle at E (on CE) are same-side interior angles. Therefore, they should be supplementary. So:

angle between AB and BE (at B) + angle between CE and BE (at E) = 180°.

But angle between AB and BE at B is angle ABE (part of triangle ABE). Angle between CE and BE at E is angle BEC (the angle at E in triangle BCE). So:

angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°

Therefore, angle BEC = 180° - angle ABE.

But angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. Let's think about triangle ABE. The sum of its angles is 180°, so:

angle at A (BAE) + angle at B (ABE) + angle at E (AEB) = 180°.

But I don't know any of these yet. However, angle AEB is adjacent to angle BEC? Wait, because point E is connected to A and C. Wait, angle AEB is part of triangle ABE, while angle BEC is part of triangle BCE. Are these angles adjacent? If you imagine point E connected to A, B, and C. So at point E, there are multiple angles. For instance, angle AEB and angle BEC may form a linear pair if points A, E, C are colinear? Wait, but CE is a line from C to E, and EA is a line from E to A. So if we consider point E, connected to C and A, then angle AEC is formed. Wait, but angle BEC is at point E between B and C. Hmm, getting confused here.

Maybe I need to consider the entire structure. Let me try to think again.

We have lines AB, BC, CE, EA, CD, ED. So starting from A, connected to B and E. From B to C, C to E, E to A. Then C to D, E to D. So D is connected to both C and E, forming triangle CDE.

Given that AB is parallel to CE. So AB || CE. Now, if I consider triangle ABE and triangle CEB? Wait, not sure. Maybe similar triangles? But only if certain conditions hold.

Alternatively, since AB || CE, then the distance between AB and CE is constant. But not sure how that helps directly.

Back to angles. We had earlier that angle BEC = 180° - angle ABE. And angle BEC = angle 5 + 58° (from previous conclusion). So:

angle BEC = angle 5 + 58° = 180° - angle ABE → angle ABE = 180° - (angle 5 + 58°) = 180° - angle5 -58° = 122° - angle5.

But angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angles are angle at A (let's say α), angle at B (ABE = 122° - angle5), and angle at E (AEB). Their sum is 180°, so:

α + (122° - angle5) + angle AEB = 180° → α + angle AEB = 58° + angle5.

Not sure yet. Let me check if there's another relation.

Looking back at the given angles: angle 1, 2, 3. Maybe they are parts of these triangles.

Angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, angle 3 is 26°. Let's assume that these are specific angles in the diagram. For example, angle 1 could be angle ABE, angle 2 could be angle AEB, or something like that. But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. However, maybe we can use the given equations.

Another equation given is SumOf(angle3, angle4, angle(B,E,C)) = 180°. Earlier, we established that angle BEC = angle5 + angle6 = angle5 + 58°. Therefore:

angle3 + angle4 + (angle5 + 58°) = 180°

Which gives angle3 + angle4 + angle5 = 180° - 58° = 122°.

But angle3 is given as 26°, so:

26° + angle4 + angle5 = 122° ⇒ angle4 + angle5 = 96°.

So angle4 + angle5 = 96°. 

But we need more equations to find angle5. Let's see if we can find expressions for angle4 and angle5.

Looking at other parts of the diagram. There's triangle CDE. Angles in triangle CDE are at C, D, E. So angle DCE, angle CDE, angle CED.

Also, since AB || CE, and CD is a line from C to D. Is CD a transversal? Maybe. Let's consider line CD intersecting AB and CE? No, CD starts at C, which is on CE. Wait, CE is a line from C to E. So point C is on CE. So line CD is extending from C to D, which is connected to E. So maybe triangle CDE is part of the figure.

In triangle CDE, the angles are:

At C: angle DCE

At D: angle CDE

At E: angle CED

But angle DCE is part of triangle BCE. Because at point C, angle DCE is adjacent to angle ECB from triangle BCE. Wait, if we consider that line CE is connected to C and E, and line CD goes from C to D, then angle DCE is part of triangle CDE and also part of triangle BCE?

Wait, no. At point C, the angles around point C are:

In triangle BCE, angle at C is angle ECB (between BC and CE).

In triangle CDE, angle at C is angle DCE (between DC and CE).

So unless DC is aligned with BC, which we don't know. So angle at C is split into angle ECB (from triangle BCE) and angle DCE (from triangle CDE)? Or maybe angle DCE is part of angle ECB?

Wait, depending on the position of D. If D is somewhere such that line CD is extending from C away from CE, then angle DCE would be adjacent to angle ECB. So the total angle at point C would be angle ECB + angle DCE?

But unless specified otherwise, we can't assume that. However, given that there are multiple triangles connected at point C, maybe there's a way to relate these angles.

Alternatively, maybe angle DCE is equal to angle ABE due to some property? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since AB || CE, and line CD intersects them? Wait, CD starts at C, which is on CE. So line CD is going from C towards D, which is connected to E. So line CD is part of triangle CDE. Not sure.

Perhaps considering triangle CDE and triangle something else. Let me think about the given angles.

We also have angle 4 and angle 5 in the sum. Maybe angle 4 is angle CDE and angle 5 is angle CED? Or some other combination.

Alternatively, angle4 and angle5 could be parts of triangle CDE. For example, angle DCE (angle at C) is angle4, angle CDE (angle at D) is angle5, and angle CED (angle at E) is something else.

But without knowing which angles are labeled as 4 and 5, it's hard to tell. However, the problem says that the sum of angle3, angle4, angle5, angle6 is 180°. Given that angle3 is 26°, angle6 is 58°, so angle4 + angle5 = 96°, as before.

But we need another equation relating angle4 and angle5. Let me think.

In triangle CDE, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle DCE + angle CDE + angle CED = 180°. Suppose angle DCE is angle4, angle CDE is angle5, then angle CED would be something else. But we don't know. Alternatively, if angle CED is angle6 or something else.

Wait, angle CED is the angle at E between C and D. Which could be related to other angles. Since CE is parallel to AB, and if there is a transversal connecting to E...

Alternatively, angle CED could be equal to angle ABE or something else due to the parallel lines.

Let me think again about AB || CE. Suppose we take line ED as a transversal. Then, since AB || CE, the angles formed by ED with AB and CE would have relations. For example, angle between AB and ED at point A (if ED passes through A?) Wait, ED connects E to D. Point A isn't necessarily on ED. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, take line AD as a transversal? Not sure.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE and triangle CDE. Maybe there's some relationship?

Alternatively, think about the fact that line ED is connected to E and D, and line CD is connected to C and D. So D is a common point between CDE and maybe another triangle?

Alternatively, focus back on triangle CDE. Let me assume that angle4 and angle5 are parts of this triangle.

Suppose angle4 is angle DCE and angle5 is angle CDE. Then angle CED would be the third angle. But angle CED is part of triangle CDE, and also, since CE is parallel to AB, maybe angle CED corresponds to some angle in triangle ABE?

Alternatively, angle CED and angle ABE are corresponding angles? Since AB || CE, and if there's a transversal that creates them.

Wait, if line BE intersects CE at E, and AB || CE, then angle CED and angle ABE might be corresponding angles?

Wait, if we consider line BE and the parallel lines AB and CE. The transversal would be BE. At point E, the line CE is part of the transversal. So angle between BE and CE at E is angle CEB (which we previously called angle BEC). And angle between BE and AB would be angle at B (which is angle ABE). As before, these two angles are supplementary.

But angle CED is different. It's the angle at E between CE and ED. So if we consider line ED as a transversal? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a vertical angle or something else.

This seems too vague. Let me go back to the equations I have.

We have angle4 + angle5 = 96°. Need to find angle5. If I can find another equation involving angle4 and angle5, I can solve for angle5.

What else do we know?

We also have angle3 = 26°, which is given. Maybe angle3 is part of triangle CDE or another triangle?

Alternatively, angle3 could be angle DCE (angle at C in triangle CDE). If that's the case, then angle DCE = 26°, which is angle4. Then angle4 = 26°, and angle5 would be 96° - 26° = 70°. But 70° isn't among the answer choices. Wait, the answer choices are 43, 47, 58, 73. So 70 isn't there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe angle3 is angle CDE (angle5), then angle5 = 26°, and angle4 = 96 - 26 = 70°. Again, not matching answer choices. So this approach might be wrong.

Wait, maybe angle3 is part of triangle BCE. Let me think. In triangle BCE, angles are angle at B (EBC), angle at C (ECB), angle at E (BEC). Suppose angle3 is one of these. Given angle3 = 26°, maybe it's angle ECB or EBC.

If angle3 is angle ECB (at point C in triangle BCE), then angle ECB = 26°. Then, in triangle BCE, we have:

angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°

So angle EBC + 26° + angle BEC = 180°

Earlier, we had angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, from the sum equation. Also, angle EBC = ?

Earlier, we had angle ABE = 122° - angle5, and angle EBC is part of angle ABE? Wait, no. Angle EBC is part of triangle BCE, whereas angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. They share the point B, but are separate angles.

Wait, at point B, there is angle ABE (part of triangle ABE) and angle EBC (part of triangle BCE). Together, they form angle ABC (assuming that points A, B, C are connected in order). So angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC.

But we don't know angle ABC yet. However, if we can find angle ABC, maybe we can relate it to something else.

But how?

Alternatively, since AB || CE, and line BC is a transversal. So the alternate interior angles would be angle ABC and angle BCE. Wait, because AB || CE, and BC is a transversal. So angle ABC (at B) and angle BCE (at C) are alternate interior angles. Hence, they are equal.

So angle ABC = angle BCE.

But angle BCE is angle ECB from triangle BCE, which we assumed was 26°, so angle ABC = 26°. Therefore, angle ABC = 26°, which would mean angle ABE + angle EBC = 26°. But earlier, we had angle ABE = 122° - angle5. So:

angle ABE + angle EBC = 26°

=> (122° - angle5) + angle EBC = 26°

But angle EBC is part of triangle BCE, which we said was angle ECB = 26°, but that might not be correct. Wait, earlier assumption was that angle ECB = 26°, which is angle3. But if angle3 is angle ECB, then angle EBC is another angle in triangle BCE.

Wait, let's clarify:

If angle3 is angle ECB (at point C in triangle BCE), then angle ECB = 26°. Then, in triangle BCE, angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°. So angle EBC + 26° + angle BEC = 180°. Also, angle BEC = angle5 + 58°.

Additionally, from earlier, angle ABC (which is angle ABE + angle EBC) equals angle BCE (which is angle ECB = 26°). So angle ABE + angle EBC = 26°.

From earlier, angle ABE = 122° - angle5. So:

(122° - angle5) + angle EBC = 26°

=> angle EBC = 26° - (122° - angle5) = angle5 - 96°

But angle EBC is an angle in triangle BCE, so it must be positive. Thus, angle5 - 96° > 0 → angle5 > 96°, which conflicts with our previous equation angle4 + angle5 = 96°, implying angle5 < 96°. Contradiction. So this suggests that my assumption that angle3 is angle ECB is incorrect.

Hmm. Let's backtrack. Perhaps angle3 is angle EBC instead of angle ECB?

So if angle3 = angle EBC = 26°, then in triangle BCE:

angle EBC = 26°, angle ECB = ?, angle BEC = ?

Also, from the parallel lines, angle ABC (at B) equals angle BCE (at C). Since AB || CE and BC is a transversal, so alternate interior angles.

So angle ABC = angle BCE. Angle ABC is composed of angle ABE + angle EBC = angle ABE + 26°. Therefore:

angle ABE + 26° = angle BCE → angle BCE = angle ABE + 26°.

But angle BCE is angle ECB in triangle BCE. So angle ECB = angle ABE + 26°.

In triangle BCE, sum of angles:

angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°

Substitute:

26° + (angle ABE + 26°) + angle BEC = 180°

→ angle ABE + angle BEC = 180° - 52° = 128°

But earlier, from the parallel lines, we had angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, because AB || CE and BE is a transversal. Wait, earlier conclusion was that angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, but here it's saying angle ABE + angle BEC = 128°. This contradiction implies that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, why did I think angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°? Because AB || CE, and BE is a transversal, so angle ABE and angle BEC are same-side interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°. But according to the above calculation, angle ABE + angle BEC = 128°, which contradicts. So there must be a mistake in assumptions.

Where did I go wrong? Let's re-examine.

If AB || CE, and BC is a transversal, then alternate interior angles are angle ABC and angle BCE. So angle ABC = angle BCE.

But angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC (since at point B, angle between AB and BE is angle ABE, and between BE and BC is angle EBC).

So angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC = angle BCE.

But earlier, we also have from the transversal BE that angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, because they're same-side interior angles.

So combining these:

From angle ABC = angle BCE → angle ABE + angle EBC = angle BCE.

But angle BCE is angle ECB in triangle BCE.

In triangle BCE:

angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°

Substituting angle ECB = angle ABE + angle EBC (from above):

angle EBC + (angle ABE + angle EBC) + angle BEC = 180°

→ angle ABE + 2*angle EBC + angle BEC = 180°

But from the parallel lines, angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, so substitute that:

(180°) + 2*angle EBC = 180° → 2*angle EBC = 0 → angle EBC = 0°, which is impossible. So contradiction again. So my assumptions must be wrong.

This indicates that my initial assumption that angle3 is either angle EBC or angle ECB is incorrect. Therefore, angle3 must be a different angle.

Maybe angle3 is part of triangle CDE? Like angle CDE or angle CED?

Let me try assuming angle3 is angle CDE. So angle CDE = 26°. Then, in triangle CDE, angles are angle DCE, angle CDE=26°, angle CED. Their sum is 180°, so angle DCE + 26° + angle CED = 180° → angle DCE + angle CED = 154°.

But how does this help us?

Also, from earlier, we have angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and angle4 and angle5 are possibly parts of triangle CDE or elsewhere.

If angle4 is angle DCE and angle5 is angle CED, then angle4 + angle5 = 154°, but we have angle4 + angle5 = 96°, which is conflicting. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, if angle4 is angle CED and angle5 is angle DCE, then same thing.

Alternatively, maybe angle4 is angle CED and angle5 is something else.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

We have angle3 = 26°, and the sum of angle3 + angle4 + angle5 + angle6 = 180°. With angle6 = 58°, so angle3 + angle4 + angle5 = 122°. So angle4 + angle5 = 96°.

If I can find angle4 or angle5 from other relations.

Let me revisit the parallel lines. AB || CE. Let's consider line CD, which connects C to D. Since AB || CE, and CD is a line from C to D, which is connected to E. Maybe line CD forms some angles with AB or CE?

If I consider line CD intersecting AB at some point? Not sure. Or maybe line CD is a transversal?

Alternatively, think about triangle CDE and the parallel lines. Since CE is parallel to AB, and if there is a line connecting D to A or something.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE and triangle CDE. Maybe they are similar or congruent? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about angle relations again. From earlier, we had angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, and angle BEC is part of triangle BCE. Also, angle BEC = 180° - angle ABE (from the parallel lines).

So angle BEC = 180° - angle ABE = angle5 + 58° → angle ABE = 180° - angle5 - 58° = 122° - angle5.

Now, in triangle ABE, the angles are angle at A (let's call it x), angle at B (ABE = 122° - angle5), and angle at E (AEB). Their sum is 180°, so:

x + (122° - angle5) + angle AEB = 180° → x + angle AEB = 58° + angle5.

Now, if we can find x or angle AEB.

Is there a relation between x and other angles? Let's think. Point A is connected to B and E. Line EA is part of the diagram. If there's a line from A to D or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || CE, and line EA is connected to E, which is on CE. So line EA is a transversal intersecting AB and CE at A and E. Wait, but EA is part of the line CE? No, because CE is from C to E, and EA is from E to A. So EA is a separate line.

Wait, but AB is parallel to CE. So if we consider line EA as a transversal, it intersects AB at A and CE at E. So the angles formed at these intersections.

At point A, line EA meets AB. At point E, line EA meets CE. So the angle at A between EA and AB is angle BAE (part of triangle ABE), and the angle at E between EA and CE is angle AEC (which is part of triangle AEC, but we don't have that triangle defined).

However, since AB || CE, the alternate interior angles would be angle BAE and angle AEC. So angle BAE = angle AEC.

But angle AEC is the angle at E between A and C, which is angle AEC. But angle AEC is also part of triangle CDE? Or not sure.

But angle AEC = angle BAE. Let's denote angle BAE as x. Then angle AEC = x.

But angle AEC is at point E, between A and C. This angle is also part of triangle CDE? If we consider triangle CDE, the angle at E is angle CED. Wait, unless D is positioned such that angle AEC and angle CED are adjacent, forming a larger angle.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. However, let's proceed.

So angle AEC = x = angle BAE.

Now, in triangle ABE, x + (122° - angle5) + angle AEB = 180° → x + angle AEB = 58° + angle5.

But angle AEB is part of the diagram. At point E, the angles around E include angle AEB (from triangle ABE), angle BEC (from triangle BCE), and angle CED (from triangle CDE), depending on the placement of D.

If D is positioned such that ED is a continuation from E to D, then angle AEC (which is x) might be related to angle CED. For example, if D lies on the extension of EC, then angle CED would be supplementary to angle AEC. But without knowing, it's speculative.

Alternatively, if angle AEC and angle CED are adjacent, forming angle AED. But again, not sure.

Let me try to think of angle AEC. Since AB || CE, and line EA is a transversal, angle BAE (x) is equal to angle AEC (as alternate interior angles). So x = angle AEC.

Now, in triangle CDE, angle at E is angle CED. If angle AEC is part of this triangle, then angle CED = angle AEC - something?

Alternatively, if D is on the line EC extended, then angle CED would be supplementary to angle AEC. So angle CED = 180° - x.

But if that's the case, then in triangle CDE, angles are angle DCE, angle CDE, angle CED = 180° - x.

But angle DCE + angle CDE + (180° - x) = 180° → angle DCE + angle CDE = x.

But I don't know what x is. However, if I can relate x to other variables.

From earlier, in triangle ABE, x + angle AEB = 58° + angle5. And angle AEB is part of the diagram. Let's assume that angle AEB is part of triangle ABE and might be related to other angles.

Alternatively, if angle AEB is equal to angle BEC or something.

Wait, angle BEC is part of triangle BCE, and angle AEB is part of triangle ABE. Are they related? If lines BE and AE are connected, maybe not directly.

But if I consider the full angle at point E, which includes angles from various triangles. At point E, the angles are:

- angle AEB (from triangle ABE)
- angle BEC (from triangle BCE)
- angle CED (from triangle CDE)

If these angles are adjacent, then their sum would be the total angle around point E. But unless specified, we can't assume they are adjacent. However, if D is placed such that ED extends from E to D, and CE is from C to E, then angle CED is part of the angle at E between C and D, and angle BEC is between B and C. So depending on where D is, these angles might be adjacent or not.

Assume that D is placed such that ED is extending from E away from C, making angle CED and angle BEC adjacent. So the total angle at E would be angle BEC + angle CED = angle BEC + angle CED. But if AB || CE, and line ED is a transversal, then angle CED might relate to angle ABE.

Wait, if ED is a transversal, and AB || CE, then angle CED and angle ABE might be corresponding angles? Let me visualize: line ED intersects AB at some point? No, ED starts at E, which is on CE. So line ED starts at E and goes to D. If AB is parallel to CE, then the angle between ED and CE (which is angle CED) would correspond to the angle between ED and AB, if there's a transversal. But ED starts at E, which is on CE, so it's not clear.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to make another assumption. Let's return to the earlier equation: angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and try to find another relation.

Recall that in triangle CDE, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle DCE + angle CDE + angle CED = 180°. If angle4 and angle5 are two of these angles, then the third is 180° - angle4 - angle5 = 180° - 96° = 84°.

But what is this third angle? If angle4 is angle DCE and angle5 is angle CDE, then angle CED = 84°. Or if angle4 is angle CDE and angle5 is angle CED, then angle DCE = 84°. Or other combinations.

But how does angle CED relate to other parts? If angle CED is related to angle ABE or something else.

Earlier, we had angle AEC = x = angle BAE, and if angle CED = 84°, and if angle AEC is related to angle CED, perhaps x + 84° = 180°, if they are supplementary? Or something like that.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's risky. Let me try assuming that angle CED = 84°, and see if that leads anywhere.

If angle CED = 84°, then from earlier, angle BEC = angle5 + 58°. Also, from the parallel lines, angle BEC = 180° - angle ABE.

But angle ABE = 122° - angle5.

So angle BEC = 180° - (122° - angle5) = 58° + angle5.

But angle BEC is also equal to angle5 + 58°, which matches. So this is consistent.

But how does this help us? Well, angle CED is part of triangle CDE, and if angle CED = 84°, then in triangle CDE, angle DCE + angle CDE = 180° - 84° = 96°, which is angle4 + angle5 = 96°. So this fits!

So, if angle CED = 84°, then angle4 + angle5 = 96°, which matches our earlier result. But how does this help us find angle5?

Well, we need to relate angle CED (84°) to other parts. Let's recall that angle CED is at point E between C and D. And since AB || CE, and line ED is a transversal, maybe angle CED is equal to angle ABE or something.

Wait, if AB || CE, and ED is a transversal, then the angles formed at E and at some other point. For example, if ED intersects AB at some point, but ED starts at E, which is on CE. So maybe angle CED is equal to angle ABE?

Let me think: since AB || CE, and ED is a transversal, then angle between ED and CE (which is angle CED) is equal to the angle between ED and AB. But ED starts at E, which is on CE, so the angle between ED and CE at E is angle CED, and the angle between ED and AB would be at a different point. Not sure.

Alternatively, if we extend ED to meet AB at some point, but without knowing where D is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if line ED is parallel to AB? No, because AB || CE, and if ED were parallel to AB, then CE would be parallel to ED, which would make AB || ED, but not sure.

Alternatively, if there is a triangle or something else.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABE and triangle CDE. If AB || CE, and if ED is parallel to AB, then angle CED would be equal to angle ABE. But this is assuming ED || AB, which we don't know.

But let's assume that ED is parallel to AB. If that's true, then angle CED (at E) would be equal to angle ABE (at B), since they are corresponding angles. So angle CED = angle ABE.

From earlier, angle CED = 84°, so angle ABE = 84°.

But earlier, we had angle ABE = 122° - angle5. So:

122° - angle5 = 84° → angle5 = 122° - 84° = 38°.

But 38° is not one of the answer choices. The options are 43, 47, 58, 73. Closest is 43, but not sure. This suggests that my assumption might be wrong.

Alternatively, if angle CED is supplementary to angle ABE, then angle CED + angle ABE = 180°. So 84° + angle ABE = 180° → angle ABE = 96°, then from angle ABE = 122° - angle5 → 122° - angle5 = 96° → angle5 = 26°, which is angle3. But angle3 is already given as 26°, so this might be possible. But then angle5 would be 26°, which is not in the answer choices either. So this is confusing.

Wait, but angle5 is supposed to be one of the answer choices. Let me check again.

If angle CED = 84°, and if angle CED is equal to angle ABE, then angle ABE = 84°, leading to angle5 = 38°, which is not an option. If angle CED is supplementary to angle ABE, then angle5 = 26°, also not an option.

But maybe angle CED is related to angle AEB?

From earlier, in triangle ABE, x + angle AEB = 58° + angle5, where x = angle BAE = angle AEC.

If angle AEC = x, and angle CED = 84°, and if angle AEC + angle CED = 180° (if they are supplementary), then x + 84° = 180° → x = 96°. Then in triangle ABE, x + angle AEB = 58° + angle5 → 96° + angle AEB = 58° + angle5 → angle AEB = angle5 - 38°. But angle AEB is an angle in triangle ABE, so it must be positive, so angle5 > 38°. But this still doesn't give us the value of angle5.

This is very tangled. Let me try to think of another approach.

We have angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and angle4 and angle5 are parts of triangle CDE, whose angles sum to 180°. If angle4 and angle5 are two of the three angles in triangle CDE, then the third angle is 180° - (angle4 + angle5) = 84°, as before. Let's call this third angle angle7, say.

So, in triangle CDE, angles are angle4, angle5, and 84°. Now, if we can relate this 84° to other parts of the diagram.

If this 84° angle is angle CED, and if angle CED is equal to angle ABE (due to parallel lines), then angle ABE = 84°. Then, from earlier, angle ABE = 122° - angle5 → 122° - angle5 = 84° → angle5 = 38°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if this 84° angle is angle DCE or angle CDE, and if it's related to other angles.

Let me consider that angle DCE is angle4, and angle CDE is angle5, so angle CED = 84°. Now, if angle DCE (angle4) is equal to angle ABE, then angle4 = angle ABE. But angle ABE = 122° - angle5. So angle4 = 122° - angle5. But angle4 + angle5 = 96°, so:

(122° - angle5) + angle5 = 96° → 122° = 96°, which is false.

No good. What if angle CDE (angle5) is equal to angle ABE? Then angle5 = angle ABE = 122° - angle5 → 2*angle5 = 122° → angle5 = 61°, which is not an option.

Still no luck.

Wait, let's recall that in triangle BCE, we had angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, and angle BEC is also equal to 180° - angle ABE. So:

angle5 + 58° = 180° - angle ABE → angle ABE = 180° - angle5 - 58° = 122° - angle5.

Now, in triangle ABE, the sum of angles is:

angle BAE + angle ABE + angle AEB = 180°

We have angle BAE = x, angle ABE = 122° - angle5, and angle AEB = ?.

But if we can relate x to other parts. For example, if x is equal to angle DCE (angle4), or something else.

If x = angle DCE = angle4, then in triangle CDE, angle4 + angle5 + 84° = 180°, so angle4 + angle5 = 96°, which is consistent.

So x = angle4.

But how to find x?

If x = angle BAE, and if there's a relation between x and other angles.

Since AB || CE, and line AE is a transversal, then angle BAE (x) and angle AEC are alternate interior angles. So angle BAE = angle AEC.

But angle AEC is part of triangle CDE. If angle AEC = x, and angle AEC is related to angle CED (which is 84°), then x + angle CED = 180°, if they are supplementary. So x + 84° = 180° → x = 96°. Then, in triangle ABE, x + angle ABE + angle AEB = 180° → 96° + (122° - angle5) + angle AEB = 180° → angle AEB = 180° - 96° - 122° + angle5 = -38° + angle5. But angle AEB cannot be negative, so angle5 must be greater than 38°. Still no direct value.

But if x = 96°, and x = angle4, then angle4 = 96°, and angle5 = 96° - angle4 = 0°, which is impossible.

Wait, no. angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and if x = angle4 = 96°, then angle5 = 96° - 96° = 0°, which is invalid.

This suggests that my assumption is wrong.

At this point, I realize I might need to use the given angle measures in the problem. We know angle1 = 58°, angle2 = 47°, angle3 = 26°. These must correspond to specific angles in the diagram. Let me try to map them.

Assume that angle1 is angle ABE, angle2 is angle AEB, and angle3 is angle CDE. Let's test this.

If angle1 = 58° = angle ABE, then from earlier, angle ABE = 122° - angle5 → 58° = 122° - angle5 → angle5 = 122° - 58° = 64°. Not an option.

Alternatively, if angle1 is angle ABE = 58°, angle2 is angle AEB = 47°, then in triangle ABE, angle BAE + 58° + 47° = 180° → angle BAE = 75°. Then, since AB || CE, angle BAE = angle AEC = 75°. If angle AEC is part of triangle CDE, then angle AEC = 75°, and if angle CED is 84°, then angle DCE = 180° - 75° - 84° = 21°. But angle3 is 26°, so this doesn't match.

Alternatively, if angle3 is angle DCE = 26°, then in triangle CDE, angle DCE = 26°, angle CDE = angle5, angle CED = 84°, so 26 + angle5 + 84 = 180 → angle5 = 70°, which is not an option.

But 70 is close to 73, which is option D. Maybe there's rounding or a calculation error?

Wait, let's try this scenario:

If angle3 is angle DCE = 26°, then in triangle CDE, angle DCE = 26°, angle CDE = angle4, angle CED = angle5. Wait, no, earlier we had angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and angle4 + angle5 + angle3 = 122°, but angle3 is 26°, so angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and in triangle CDE, angle DCE + angle CDE + angle CED = 180°. If angle DCE = 26°, then angle CDE + angle CED = 154°. But we also have angle4 + angle5 = 96°. So if angle4 and angle5 are angle CDE and angle CED, then their sum is 96°, but in reality it should be 154°, which is a contradiction. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, if angle3 is angle CDE = 26°, then in triangle CDE, angle CDE = 26°, and angle4 + angle5 = 96°, where angle4 and angle5 are angle DCE and angle CED. So angle DCE + angle CED = 96°, and angle CDE = 26°, so total angle sum is 96 + 26 = 122°, which is less than 180°, so missing 58°, which is angle6. But angle6 is 58°, which is given. This doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, earlier we had the equation from the sum of angle3 + angle4 + angle5 + angle6 = 180°, which gave us angle4 + angle5 = 96°. If angle3 is 26°, angle6 is 58°, then yes. But if angle3 is part of triangle CDE, then it might be part of the 96° sum. This is too ambiguous without a diagram.

Maybe I need to consider that angle1, angle2, angle3 are specific angles in the diagram. Let's try to associate them with the triangles.

Given that there are triangles BCE, CDE, ABE. Let's assume:

- Angle1 is angle ABE (at B in triangle ABE)
- Angle2 is angle AEB (at E in triangle ABE)
- Angle3 is angle CDE (at D in triangle CDE)

With angle1 = 58°, angle2 = 47°, angle3 = 26°.

In triangle ABE, angles are 58°, 47°, and angle BAE. So angle BAE = 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°.

Since AB || CE, and line AE is a transversal, then angle BAE (75°) is equal to angle AEC (alternate interior angles). So angle AEC = 75°.

Now, in triangle CDE, angle CDE is 26° (angle3), and angle AEC is 75°, which might be related to angle CED or something else.

If angle AEC is part of triangle CDE, then angle AEC = angle CED + something?

If D is positioned such that ED is extending from E, then angle CED is part of angle AEC. For example, if D is on the line extending from E away from C, then angle CED is part of angle AEC. So angle AEC = angle CED + angle DEB or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, if angle AEC = 75°, and angle CED is part of it, then angle CED = 75° - angle something.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. Let's assume that angle CED is 75°, then in triangle CDE, angles are angle DCE, 26°, 75°, so angle DCE = 180 - 26 - 75 = 79°.

But how does this relate to other parts?

Also, from earlier, we had angle4 + angle5 = 96°, where angle4 and angle5 are parts of the diagram. If angle4 is angle DCE = 79°, and angle5 is angle CDE = 26°, then 79 + 26 = 105°, which is not 96°. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if angle4 is angle CDE = 26°, and angle5 is angle CED = 75°, then 26 + 75 = 101°, still not 96°.

This suggests inconsistency.

But let's recall that angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and if angle CED is part of this sum. Let's say angle5 is angle CED = 75°, then angle4 = 96 - 75 = 21°. But angle4 is part of the diagram, possibly angle DCE or something.

If angle4 is angle DCE = 21°, then in triangle CDE, angles are 21°, 26°, and 75°, which sum to 122°, missing 58°, which is angle6. But angle6 is 58°, which might be part of another triangle.

Wait, angle6 is equal to angle1, which is 58°. Maybe angle6 is angle BEC, which we had earlier as angle5 + 58°. Wait, no, angle6 is equal to angle1, which is 58°. So angle6 is 58°, and from earlier, angle BEC = angle5 + 58°.

If angle BEC is part of triangle BCE, and if angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, and if angle BEC is also related to other angles.

From the parallel lines, angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, and angle ABE is 58°, so angle BEC = 180° - 58° = 122°. So angle BEC = 122° = angle5 + 58° → angle5 = 64°. But 64 is not an option. Closest is 73 (option D). But this might suggest that there's a calculation error or misassumption.

Wait, if angle ABE is 58°, then angle BEC = 180 - 58 = 122°, so angle5 = 122 - 58 = 64°. But this is not an option. However, if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check: angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, and angle BEC = 122°, so angle5 = 122 - 58 = 64°. But none of the options is 64. However, if there's a mistake in assuming angle ABE is 58°, maybe it's different.

If angle1 is angle ABE = 58°, angle2 is angle AEB = 47°, then angle BAE = 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. Then, angle AEC = 75° (because AB || CE, alternate interior angles). Then, in triangle CDE, if angle CED = 75°, and angle3 is 26° (say, angle CDE), then angle DCE = 180 - 75 - 26 = 79°. Then, in the sum angle3 + angle4 + angle5 + angle6 = 180°, where angle3 = 26°, angle6 = 58°, and angle4 and angle5 are 79 and 75? Wait, no, angle4 and angle5 are part of the sum. If angle4 is 79° and angle5 is 75°, then 26 + 79 + 75 + 58 = 238°, which is not 180°. So this is wrong.

This suggests that my assumptions about which angles are which are incorrect.

At this point, after trying multiple approaches without success, I'll try to use the earlier equation where angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and try to find angle5 using other given data.

From the sum of angles in triangle BCE, we had:

angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°

From the parallel lines, angle ABC = angle BCE.

Also, angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC.

So, angle ABE + angle EBC = angle BCE.

Let me denote angle EBC as y, angle BCE as z, angle BEC as w.

So, y + z + w = 180°.

Also, from parallel lines, angle ABC = z, and angle ABC = angle ABE + y.

So, angle ABE + y = z.

Also, from the parallel lines, angle ABE + w = 180°, so w = 180° - angle ABE.

Substituting w into the first equation:

y + z + (180° - angle ABE) = 180°

→ y + z - angle ABE = 0

But from angle ABE + y = z, so replace z with angle ABE + y:

y + (angle ABE + y) - angle ABE = 0 → 2y = 0 → y = 0°, which is impossible. This suggests a contradiction, indicating a flaw in assumptions.

This means that my earlier assumption about the relationship between angle ABC and angle BCE is incorrect. Perhaps the alternate interior angles are different.

Wait, AB || CE, and BC is a transversal. Alternate interior angles would be angle ABC and angle BCE. So angle ABC = angle BCE.

But if angle ABC = angle BCE, and angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC, then angle ABE + angle EBC = angle BCE.

But in triangle BCE, angle EBC + angle BCE + angle BEC = 180°.

Substituting angle BCE = angle ABE + angle EBC:

angle EBC + (angle ABE + angle EBC) + angle BEC = 180°

→ angle ABE + 2*angle EBC + angle BEC = 180°

But from the parallel lines, angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°, so:

(180°) + 2*angle EBC = 180° → 2*angle EBC = 0 → angle EBC = 0°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there is a fundamental error in the setup, possibly in the interpretation of the diagram.

Given the time spent and lack of progress, I'll try to use the given equations and the fact that angle4 + angle5 = 96°, and try to find angle5 using the available data.

From the sum of angles in triangle BCE: angle EBC + angle BCE + angle BEC = 180°

From the parallel lines, angle ABC = angle BCE, and angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC.

Let me call angle ABE as x, angle EBC as y, angle BCE as z.

So, z = x + y.

From the parallel lines, angle ABE + angle BEC = 180° → x + angle BEC = 180° → angle BEC = 180° - x.

In triangle BCE: y + z + (180° - x) = 180° → y + z - x = 0.

But z = x + y, so substitute:

y + (x + y) - x = 0 → 2y = 0 → y = 0°. Again, impossible.

This implies that the initial assumptions about the diagram are wrong, possibly the labeling of the angles or the parallel lines.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll try to use the given answer choices and work backward.

The question asks for angle5. The options are 43, 47, 58, 73.

From earlier, we had angle4 + angle5 = 96°. If angle5 is 43°, then angle4 = 53°. If angle5 is 47°, angle4 = 49°. If 58°, angle4 = 38°. If 73°, angle4 = 23°.

Now, let's assume that angle5 is 43°, so angle4 = 53°. How can this fit?

If angle4 is 53°, and angle5 is 43°, then in triangle CDE, if angle4 and angle5 are two angles, the third is 84°, as before. If this 84° is angle CED, and if it is equal to angle ABE, then angle ABE = 84°. From earlier, angle ABE = 122° - angle5 = 122 - 43 = 79°, which doesn't match 84°. Not matching.

If angle5 is 47°, then angle4 = 49°. If angle4 is 49°, angle5 is 47°, and the third angle is 84°. If angle CED = 84°, and if it is equal to angle ABE, then angle ABE = 84°. From angle ABE = 122 - angle5 = 122 - 47 = 75°, which doesn't match 84°.

If angle5 is 58°, then angle4 = 38°. If angle4 is 38°, angle5 is 58°, and the third angle is 84°. If angle CED = 84°, and angle ABE = 84°, then from angle ABE = 122 - 58 = 64°, which doesn't match.

If angle5 is 73°, then angle4 = 23°. If angle CED = 84°, and angle ABE = 84°, then angle ABE = 122 - 73 = 49°, which doesn't match.

None of these seem to fit. But let's think about the possibility that angle5 is 43°, and angle4 is 53°, and the third angle in triangle CDE is 84°, which is angle CED. If angle CED is 84°, and if it is supplementary to angle ABE, then angle ABE = 96°, and from angle ABE = 122 - angle5 = 96 → angle5 = 26°, which is angle3. But angle3 is already given as 26°, so this might be possible. But angle5 would be 26°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if angle CED is 84°, and it is equal to angle3 = 26°, which is not possible.

This suggests that there's an error in my approach, but given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the most plausible scenario.

Previously, when I assumed angle BEC = 122°, which led to angle5 = 64°, and since 64 is closest to 73 (option D), I might choose D. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if angle5 is 43°, and angle4 is 53°, and if angle4 is angle3 = 26°, then 26 + 53 = 79, which doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think about the sum of angle3 + angle4 + angle5 + angle6 = 180°, with angle3 = 26, angle6 = 58. So 26 + angle4 + angle5 + 58 = 180 → angle4 + angle5 = 96. If angle4 is 47° (angle2), then angle5 = 49°, which is not an option. If angle4 is 58° (angle1), then angle5 = 38°, not an option. If angle4 is 26° (angle3), then angle5 = 70°, not an option. If angle4 is 47° (angle2), angle5 = 49°, no. If angle5 is 47°, then angle4 = 49°, which is not an option. If angle5 is 73°, then angle4 = 23°, not an option.

Wait, but the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(3), 26), and Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))), 180). So angle3 + angle4 + angle5 + angle6 = 180. Given angle3 = 26, angle6 = 58, so 26 + angle4 + angle5 + 58 = 180 → angle4 + angle5 = 96. So angle4 + angle5 = 96.

Now, if angle4 is angle2 = 47°, then angle5 = 96 - 47 = 49°, not an option. If angle4 is angle1 = 58°, then angle5 = 38°, not an option. If angle4 is angle3 = 26°, then angle5 = 70°, not an option. If angle5 is angle2 = 47°, then angle4 = 49°, not an option. If angle5 is angle1 = 58°, then angle4 = 38°, not an option. If angle5 is angle6 = 58°, then angle4 = 38°, not an option.

Wait, but what if angle4 is angle BEC? No, angle6 is already 58°, and angle BEC is angle5 + 58°. So angle BEC = angle5 + 58°, which is part of the sum in the triangle BCE.

But I'm running out of ideas. Given the options, and the closest possible value from earlier calculation where angle5
