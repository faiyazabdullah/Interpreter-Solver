MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the triangles and their properties relate to each other. 

So, we have two triangles: Triangle(W,S,R) and Triangle(T,V,R). There are several points mentioned: W, S, R, T, V. The lines connecting them include W-S, W-R, S-R for the first triangle, and T-V, T-R, V-R for the second. Also, there are some equalities involving lengths and angles, and congruence between angles and similarity between triangles. 

The key thing here is that the triangles are similar. The problem states that Triangle(W,S,R) is similar to Triangle(T,V,R). So, similarity implies corresponding angles are equal and sides are proportional. Let me recall that when two triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Also, since they mention specific ratios, like RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(W,S)), LengthOf(Line(V,T))) equals RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(W,R)), LengthOf(Line(T,R))), which should hold because of similarity.

Let me note down the given length equalities:

- Length of Line(W,S) is 8. So WS = 8.
- Length of Line(W,R) is Add(x,6), so WR = x + 6.
- Length of Line(T,R) is Add(Mul(2,x),6), so TR = 2x + 6.
- Length of Line(V,T) is 10, so VT = 10.

Also, there's a congruence between angles at W and T (Angle(W) ≅ Angle(T)) and between angles at WRS and TRV (Angle(W,R,S) ≅ Angle(T,R,V)). This suggests that the triangles might be similar by AA similarity criterion, since two angles being congruent would make the third angle also congruent, hence similar.

Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion. Now, I need to determine which sides correspond. Let me think about the order of the vertices in the triangle names. Triangle(W,S,R) corresponds to Triangle(T,V,R). So, the correspondence is W→T, S→V, R→R? Wait, but both triangles share point R. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, Triangle(W,S,R) has vertices W, S, R. Triangle(T,V,R) has vertices T, V, R. So, the order might indicate that W corresponds to T, S corresponds to V, and R corresponds to R. But then, the side opposite angle W in Triangle(W,S,R) would be SR. Similarly, the side opposite angle T in Triangle(T,V,R) would be VR. Wait, maybe I need to consider the angles more carefully.

Alternatively, since the angles at W and T are congruent, and the angles at R? Wait, no. The problem says Congruent(Angle(W), Angle(T)), meaning the angle at vertex W in Triangle(W,S,R) is congruent to the angle at vertex T in Triangle(T,V,R). Then, Congruent(Angle(W,R,S), Angle(T,R,V)): Angle(W,R,S) is the angle at R in Triangle(W,S,R)? Wait, no. Wait, Angle(W,R,S) refers to the angle at point R? Wait, the notation can sometimes be confusing. In standard terms, Angle(W,R,S) would be the angle at point R, formed by points W, R, S. Similarly, Angle(T,R,V) is the angle at point R in Triangle(T,V,R). Therefore, these two angles are congruent. So, the two triangles have two pairs of congruent angles: angle at W and angle at T, and angle at R (since Angle(W,R,S) and Angle(T,R,V) are both at R). Therefore, by AA similarity, Triangle(W,S,R) ~ Triangle(T,V,R).

Therefore, the correspondence of vertices would be such that angle W corresponds to angle T, angle R corresponds to angle R, and angle S corresponds to angle V. Wait, but angle R is common? Wait, if both triangles have an angle at R, then perhaps the correspondence is W→T, S→V, R→R. That makes sense because the angle at R in both triangles is included. Wait, but in the first triangle, angle at R is part of the angle (W,R,S), and in the second triangle, angle at R is part of (T,R,V). Since those angles are congruent, as per the given.

So, if the triangles are similar with correspondence W→T, S→V, R→R, then the sides opposite these angles would be proportional. Let me write down the correspondence:

In Triangle(W,S,R):

- Side opposite angle W is SR.
- Side opposite angle S is WR.
- Side opposite angle R is WS.

In Triangle(T,V,R):

- Side opposite angle T is VR.
- Side opposite angle V is TR.
- Side opposite angle R is TV.

But wait, according to the similarity, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. Since angle W corresponds to angle T, angle S corresponds to angle V, angle R corresponds to angle R. Therefore, the sides opposite angle W (SR) corresponds to the side opposite angle T (VR). Similarly, side opposite angle S (WR) corresponds to side opposite angle V (TR). And side opposite angle R (WS) corresponds to side opposite angle R (TV). Wait, but the side opposite angle R in the first triangle is WS, and in the second triangle, it's TV. So, the ratio of WS / TV should be equal to the ratio of SR / VR, and also equal to WR / TR.

Given that, let's write the proportions. Let me denote the ratio as k. So,

WS / TV = SR / VR = WR / TR.

We know WS = 8, TV = 10. So, 8/10 = 4/5. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 4:5. Thus, each pair of corresponding sides should be in the ratio 4:5.

Now, looking at the sides WR and TR. WR is x+6, and TR is 2x +6. According to the ratio, WR / TR should equal 4/5. Therefore:

(x + 6)/(2x + 6) = 4/5

Cross-multiplying:

5(x + 6) = 4(2x + 6)

Expanding:

5x + 30 = 8x + 24

Subtracting 5x and 24 from both sides:

30 -24 = 8x -5x → 6 = 3x → x=2.

Wait, but then x is 2. However, the question asks for WR. WR is x +6, so substituting x=2 gives WR = 2+6=8. But let me verify if this is consistent with the rest of the information.

But before that, let me check if my assumption about the correspondence of the sides was correct. Because if the ratio is 4/5, then another way to check could be using the other sides. For example, the ratio of SR / VR should also be 4/5. But do we know SR or VR?

Wait, SR is a side in Triangle(W,S,R). Let's see, Triangle(W,S,R) has sides WS=8, WR=x+6, and SR. Similarly, Triangle(T,V,R) has sides TV=10, TR=2x+6, and VR. If the ratio is 4/5, then SR / VR = 4/5. But unless we have more info on SR or VR, we can't directly compute. But since we already used WR/TR ratio and found x=2, leading to WR=8. Let me check if that holds with the other ratios.

But let me check again. Suppose x=2, then WR = 8, TR=2*2 +6=10. So WR/TR=8/10=4/5. Which matches the ratio from WS/TV=8/10=4/5. So that seems consistent. 

But then the problem asks for WR. If x=2, WR is 8, which is option B. But let me check if there's anything else I missed. 

Another way: Let's look at the ratio of WS/TV = 8/10 = 4/5. Also, the ratio of WR/TR should be same. So WR/TR = 4/5. As above. Solving gives x=2, making WR=8. Therefore, answer is B. 

Wait, but let me confirm if the correspondence of the sides is correct. Because if the triangles are similar with the correspondence W→T, S→V, R→R, then the sides WS corresponds to TV, WR corresponds to TR, and SR corresponds to VR. Hence, the ratio WS/TV = WR/TR = SR/VR. 

Yes, that's correct. So that's why the ratio is 4/5. Therefore, solving WR/TR = 4/5 gives us x=2, leading to WR=8. So answer B. But let me check if there are other possibilities. For instance, could the correspondence be different? Like, maybe the triangles are similar in a different order? For example, maybe W corresponds to V, etc.? But the angles given are congruent: angle at W and angle at T, and angle at R. So the correspondence is likely W→T, S→V, R→R. 

Alternatively, suppose that the correspondence is different. Suppose angle W corresponds to angle V, and angle T corresponds to angle S? But the problem states that angle(W) is congruent to angle(T), so that would mean that angle at W in first triangle corresponds to angle at T in second triangle. So that supports the earlier correspondence. 

Hence, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, WR = x +6 = 2 +6=8. So answer B. 

But let me check once more. Let me plug x=2 into all variables. 

Then:

WR = x+6 = 8.

TR = 2x+6 = 10.

So WR/TR = 8/10 = 4/5. 

WS =8, TV=10, so 8/10=4/5. 

Thus, the ratio is maintained. Also, the other sides: SR and VR. Let's find SR and VR. 

Using the Law of Cosines? Or maybe via triangle relations? Well, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of SR/VR = 4/5. But without knowing specific values, maybe we don't need them. However, if needed, we could calculate. 

Alternatively, maybe check if other conditions are satisfied. For example, in Triangle(W,S,R), we have sides WS=8, WR=8, and SR. Wait, if WS=8 and WR=8, then triangle WSR has two sides equal? Wait, no. Wait, Triangle(W,S,R): sides are WS=8, WR=8, and SR. So that would make it an isoceles triangle with WS=WR=8? Wait, but that's only if the sides are WS and WR. Wait, but in Triangle(W,S,R), the sides are WS, SR, and WR. So if WS=8 and WR=8, then yes, it's isoceles with base SR. But does that affect anything? Maybe not necessarily. 

But in any case, the problem didn't specify any other constraints except the ones given. So if our calculation leads to x=2 and WR=8, then that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the correspondence. Let me think again. Another possibility: What if the correspondence is W→V, S→T, R→R? Then the angles at W and S would correspond to angles at V and T? But the problem says that angle(W) ≅ angle(T). So angle at W corresponds to angle at T. So that would require that angle(W) is in the first triangle, and angle(T) in the second triangle. Therefore, the correspondence must have angle W in first triangle matching angle T in second triangle. Therefore, the correspondence of vertices would be W→T, S→V, R→R. So the sides opposite these angles would be SR (opposite angle W) vs VR (opposite angle T). Therefore, the ratio SR/VR = WS/TV = 4/5. 

But even if that's the case, we still use the ratio WR/TR = WS/TV. So regardless of the correspondence of the other sides, the ratio between WR and TR is determined by the ratio of the corresponding sides. 

Thus, my previous conclusion stands. Therefore, WR is 8, answer B. 

But let me check if the problem mentions anything about the line segments. For example, in Triangle(W,S,R), the lines are W-S, W-R, S-R. Similarly for the other triangle. So all sides are accounted for. 

Another check: The problem says that the ratio of WS to VT equals the ratio of WR to TR. Which is 8/10 = 4/5, and WR/TR is 8/10 = 4/5. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the value of WR is 8, so the answer is B.

### Step 1: Assign Known Values

From the given data:

- $ \text{Length}(W,S) = 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(W,R) = x + 6 $
- $ \text{Length}(T,R) = 2x + 6 $
- $ \text{Length}(V,T) = 10 $

Also, the similarity ratio between the triangles is defined as:

$$
\frac{\text{Length}(W,S)}{\text{Length}(V,T)} = \frac{\text{Length}(W,R)}{\text{Length}(T,R)}
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
\frac{8}{10} = \frac{x + 6}{2x + 6}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the Proportion

Cross-multiply:

$$
8(2x + 6) = 10(x + 6)
$$

Expand both sides:

$$
16x + 48 = 10x + 60
$$

Simplify:

$$
6x = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Value of $ \text{Length}(W,R) $

Recall:

$$
\text{Length}(W,R) = x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
$$

---

### Final Verification

Check that the similarity ratio holds:

- $ \frac{8}{10} = \frac{8}{10} $ ✅  
- All given constraints regarding angles and side ratios are satisfied under this solution.
