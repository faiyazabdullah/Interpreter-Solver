MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the trapezoid based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided.

We have a quadrilateral JKL M, which is a trapezoid. The lines JK, KL, LM, and MJ form the sides. Also, there are some specific conditions:

- Lines JK and ML are parallel (since they're stated as parallel).
- The lengths of JM and KL are both equal to 6 units. So JM = KL = 6.
- Angles at points M and L are given: angle JML is 80 degrees. Wait, no—let me check again. The angles mentioned are Angle(J,M,L) which would be angle at point M between J and L? Wait, angle notation: Angle(J,M,L) means vertex at M, with segments MJ and ML. So that's angle at M between J and L. Similarly, Angle(M,L,K) is angle at L between M and K. Then Angle(L,K,J) is angle at K between L and J. And Angle(K,J,M) is angle at J between K and M. 

Also, it says that JM and KL are legs of the trapezoid, and JK and ML are the bases. Since in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. But here, since JK and ML are parallel (as per Parallel(Line(J,K), Line(M,L))), then the legs would be JM and KL. Which makes sense because JM and KL are the ones connecting the two bases. 

Additionally, there's a congruence between JM and KL, so those legs are equal in length. That also fits with the trapezoid being isosceles? Wait, but not necessarily. In an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are equal and base angles are equal. However, we might not know yet if it's isosceles. But maybe the given angles can help us figure that out.

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle K. So angle at point K. Let me denote angle K as ∠JKL, since the points are J, K, L. Wait, the angle at K would be formed by points J, K, L. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The angle at point K would be between points J, K, L? Or between points J, K, and another point?

Wait, the angles mentioned in the problem include Angle(L,K,J), which is angle at K between L and J. So that's ∠L K J, meaning the angle at K between points L and J. So that's the angle at K. Therefore, the question is asking for the measure of angle LKJ, which is angle at K.

So our goal is to find ∠LKJ, which is angle at K. Let me note that.

Given that JM and KL are legs, each of length 6. The bases are JK and ML. Also, the sum of measures of angles at J and M equals 180, same for angles at K and L? Wait, looking back:

The problem states:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,J))), 180)

Which translates to: Sum of angle at M (which is ∠JML = 80°) and angle at K (∠L K J) equals 180°. So:

∠JML + ∠LKJ = 180°

Given that ∠JML is 80°, then ∠LKJ = 180° - 80° = 100°. Wait, but that seems straightforward. However, wait—is that correct?

Wait, let me confirm. The first equality given is:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)), MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,J))) = 180

So angle J,M,L is ∠JML (vertex at M), and angle L,K,J is ∠LKJ (vertex at K). These two angles are supplementary. Therefore, their sum is 180°. Given that ∠JML is 80°, then ∠LKJ is 100°, making the answer 100°, which is option C.

But wait, before jumping to conclusion, let me check if there are other constraints that could affect this. For example, the other sum:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))), 180)

Let me parse these angles. Angle(K,J,M) is angle at J between K and M, which is ∠KJM. Angle(M,L,K) is angle at L between M and K, which is ∠MLK. Their sum is 180°. So ∠KJM + ∠MLK = 180°.

But how does that relate to angle at K?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Wait, yes! Because the bases are parallel. So, for example, angles adjacent to each leg are supplementary. So, in a trapezoid with bases JK and ML, the legs are JM and KL. Therefore, angles at J and M are on one base, and angles at K and L are on the other base. Wait, but actually, the consecutive angles between the bases would be supplementary.

Wait, more accurately, in a trapezoid, each pair of angles on the same side (i.e., adjacent to a leg) are supplementary. So, for example, angle at J (between base JK and leg JM) and angle at M (between base ML and leg JM) are supplementary. Similarly, angle at K (between base KL and leg KM?) Wait, maybe I need to think carefully.

Wait, the trapezoid has two bases: JK and ML. The legs are JM and KL. Wait, but the legs are JM and KL. So, each leg connects a base to the other base. So leg JM connects base JK (at J) to base ML (at M). Leg KL connects base JK (at K) to base ML (at L).

Therefore, the angles adjacent to leg JM are angle at J (∠KJM) and angle at M (∠JML). These should be supplementary. Similarly, angles adjacent to leg KL are angle at K (∠JKL) and angle at L (∠KLM). These should also be supplementary. Wait, but according to the problem statement, we have:

Sum of ∠JML (which is angle at M) and ∠LKJ (angle at K) equals 180°, which matches the property that angles adjacent to leg JM and KL are supplementary. Wait, but ∠JML is adjacent to leg JM, and ∠LKJ is adjacent to leg KL. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the pairs.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that the two bases are parallel implies that angles on the same side are supplementary. For instance, angles at J and M are on the same side (left side?), but depending on orientation. Let me try to imagine the trapezoid.

Assume that bases JK and ML are horizontal, with JK on top and ML at bottom. Then legs JM and KL connect them. So point J is top-left, K is top-right, L is bottom-right, M is bottom-left. Then angles:

At point J: between base JK and leg JM. At point M: between base ML and leg JM. Those two angles are on the same side (left side) of the trapezoid, hence supplementary. Similarly, at point K: between base JK and leg KL; at point L: between base ML and leg KL. Those are on the right side, supplementary.

So ∠KJM (at J) + ∠JML (at M) = 180°, and ∠JKL (at K) + ∠KLM (at L) = 180°. 

In the problem, we are told that ∠JML is 80°, so ∠KJM = 180° - 80° = 100°. Also, there's another equation: Sum of ∠KJM (which is ∠KJM) and ∠KLM (angle at L) is 180°. Wait, but the problem gives:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))) = 180

Angle(K,J,M) is ∠KJM, and Angle(M,L,K) is ∠KLM. So ∠KJM + ∠KLM = 180°. But since ∠KJM is 100°, then ∠KLM = 80°. 

But how does this help us find ∠LKJ, which is the angle at K?

Wait, the angle at K is ∠JKL. Let me think about triangle or other relations. Alternatively, considering the trapezoid's angles.

Since the trapezoid has two bases, JK and ML, and legs JM and KL. We know that JM and KL are both 6 units long, and they are the legs. Also, angles at J and M are supplementary, angles at K and L are supplementary.

But we need to find ∠LKJ, which is the angle at K. Let me consider the angles around the trapezoid.

Total sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. If we can find other angles, maybe we can compute ∠LKJ.

Alternatively, using the given equations. From earlier:

∠JML = 80°, and ∠JML + ∠LKJ = 180°, so ∠LKJ = 100°, which would directly give the answer as 100°, which is option C. However, I need to verify if that's accurate.

But why is ∠JML + ∠LKJ = 180°? Because they are adjacent angles on different legs? Or maybe they are not supplementary. Wait, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Let me re-examine the problem's given equations.

The problem states:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,J))), 180)

Which is ∠JML + ∠LKJ = 180°. This is given as a constraint. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a standard trapezoid property or not, this is a direct equation given in the problem. Hence, since ∠JML is 80°, then ∠LKJ = 100°, which is option C.

But to make sure there are no contradictions elsewhere, let's check other constraints. For example, the other sum:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))) = 180

Angle(K,J,M) is ∠KJM, and Angle(M,L,K) is ∠KLM. As above, this sum is 180°. Suppose ∠KJM is 100°, then ∠KLM = 80°, as previously thought. Now, considering the total sum of angles in the trapezoid:

∠JML (80°) + ∠KJM (100°) + ∠KLM (80°) + ∠LKJ (100°) = 80+100+80+100= 360°, which checks out. So that works.

Thus, ∠LKJ is indeed 100°, which corresponds to option C. Therefore, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle K $, we begin by analyzing the structure of the trapezoid $ JKLM $ defined by the following key constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Shape**
- **Bases**: $ JK $ and $ ML $ are parallel.
- **Legs**: $ JM $ and $ KL $ are non-parallel sides (legs) and are congruent in length:  
  $$
  |JM| = |KL| = 6
  $$

This tells us that the trapezoid has **two congruent legs**, suggesting symmetry and potentially an **isosceles trapezoid**. However, even without assuming isosceles, we can proceed with the given angle relationships.

---

### **Step 2: Use Given Angle Relationships**

From the problem, we are given:

$$
\text{SumOf}( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle J,M,L), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle L,K,J)) = 180^\circ
$$

Interpreting the angle notations:

- $ \angle J,M,L = \angle JML $
- $ \angle L,K,J = \angle LKJ $

So,

$$
\angle JML + \angle LKJ = 180^\circ
$$

We’re also given:

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle JML) = 80^\circ
$$

Substituting into the equation:

$$
80^\circ + \angle LKJ = 180^\circ
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \angle LKJ = 100^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Interpret the Result**

$ \angle LKJ $ is the angle at point $ K $, formed by the segments $ LK $ and $ KJ $. Thus, it is the **measure of $ \angle K $**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the given constraints and angle relationships, we have determined that:

$$
m\angle K = \boxed{100^\circ}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**  
Final Answer: C
