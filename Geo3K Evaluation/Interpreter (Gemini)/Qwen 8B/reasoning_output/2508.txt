MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have an equilateral triangle ABC. Wait, because it says Equilateral(Triangle(A,B,C)). In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal and all angles are 60 degrees. But there are some equations here involving lengths of sides related to x. Let me parse that again.

The problem gives:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Add(Mul(2,x), 11)) → So length AB = 2x + 11.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Sub(Mul(6,x), 9)) → Length AC = 6x - 9.

Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))). Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides should be equal. Therefore, AB must equal AC. So setting those two expressions equal to each other:

2x + 11 = 6x - 9.

Let me solve for x. Subtract 2x both sides: 11 = 4x - 9. Then add 9 to both sides: 20 = 4x. Divide both sides by 4: x = 5. 

Wait, so x would be 5? Let me check if that makes sense. If x=5, then AB = 2*5 +11 = 10+11=21. AC = 6*5 -9=30-9=21. Yes, they are equal. So that works. Also, since it's an equilateral triangle, BC should also be equal to AB and AC. But the problem didn't mention BC's length. However, the constraints given only involve AB and AC, but since the triangle is equilateral, BC must equal them as well. But maybe there's more to check?

But wait, the problem mentions Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)), which is already satisfied because AB equals AC. So everything checks out. Therefore, solving 2x +11 =6x -9 gives x=5. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The problem also mentions angles being congruent. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all angles are congruent (each 60 degrees). The angle constraints given are about angles at A, B, C. For example, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, right? Because the notation Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. Similarly, Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A between points B and C. But since the triangle is equilateral, all angles are equal. So the congruence conditions are automatically satisfied. So no conflict there.

So the key equation was AB = AC, leading to x=5. Hence, answer B.
