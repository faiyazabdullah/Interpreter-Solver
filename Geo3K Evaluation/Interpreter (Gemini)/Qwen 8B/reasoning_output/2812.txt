<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral WXYZ inscribed in a circle with center V. That means it's a cyclic quadrilateral. The question is asking for the measure of angle X, which I think refers to angle at point X, so angle WXY? Wait, need to clarify that. Let me check the problem again.

The points mentioned are W, X, Y, Z forming quadrilateral WXYZ. The angles given are Angle(Z,W,X) which would be angle at W between Z and X, right? Because in notation, Angle(Z,W,X) is the angle at point W formed by points Z, W, X. Similarly, Angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between W and Y. Then Angle(X,Y,Z) is angle at Y, and Angle(Y,Z,W) is angle at Z. Wait, but the problem says:

Given angles:
- MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X),95): So angle at W (since it's Z-W-X) is 95 degrees.
- MeasureOf(Angle(Z,V,Y),60): This seems like angle at V between Z and Y. But since V is the center of the circle, maybe there's some relationship here.
Also, Add(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)),MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)),180). Wait, Angle(Z,Y,X) would be angle at Y between Z and X. So adding angle at W (Z,W,X=95) and angle at Y (Z,Y,X) equals 180? And then another condition: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)),MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,Y)),180). Angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X between W and Y, and angle(W,Z,Y) is angle at Y between W and Z?

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Since WXYZ is cyclic, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees? Wait no, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. Wait, but here they might have given specific angles and relations. Let me list down all given info:

First, Quadrilateral WXYZ is inscribed in Circle V. Therefore, it's a cyclic quadrilateral. So the key property is that the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180 degrees. However, the given angles might not directly be opposite angles. Let me note the angles given:

1. Angle(Z,W,X) = 95°. As per notation, this is angle at W, between Z and X. So ∠ZWX = 95°.

2. Angle(Z,V,Y) = 60°. This is the angle at V between points Z and Y. Since V is the center of the circle, this is the central angle subtended by arc ZY. Therefore, the measure of arc ZY is 60°, because central angles equal their subtended arcs.

Then, two equations:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)),MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)),180). Which translates to ∠ZWX + ∠ZYX = 180°. Wait, ∠ZYX is angle at Y between Z and X, so that's ∠ZYX. Let me confirm:

∠Z,Y,X is angle at Y between Z and X. So yes, ∠ZYX. So according to the equation, ∠ZWX + ∠ZYX = 180°. Given ∠ZWX is 95°, so ∠ZYX = 180 - 95 = 85°. Therefore, ∠ZYX = 85°.

Another equation: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)),MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,Y)),180). So ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180°. Wait, ∠WXY is angle at X between W and Y, which is ∠WXY. ∠WZY is angle at Y between W and Z. Wait, how does that relate?

But perhaps I need to find angle at X, which is ∠WXY. Let me see.

Let me recall that in cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. So ∠W + ∠Y = 180°, and ∠X + ∠Z = 180°. But wait, in our case, do we know any of these angles?

We know ∠ZWX (which is part of ∠W?) Wait, need to clarify the notation. Let me define the angles properly.

Quadrilateral WXYZ has vertices in order W, X, Y, Z. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Then the angles are:

At W: between Z and X → ∠ZWX.

At X: between W and Y → ∠WXY.

At Y: between X and Z → ∠XYZ.

At Z: between Y and W → ∠YZW.

So the four angles are ∠ZWX, ∠WXY, ∠XYZ, ∠YZW.

Since it's cyclic, ∠ZWX + ∠XYZ = 180°, and ∠WXY + ∠YZW = 180°. 

But the problem gives us:

1. ∠ZWX = 95°, so ∠XYZ = 180 - 95 = 85°. Wait, but earlier we had from the equation that ∠ZYX (which is ∠XYZ) is 85°, so that matches. So that checks out.

Now, the second equation: ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180°. Wait, ∠WZY is the angle at Z between W and Y, which is ∠YZW. So ∠WXY + ∠YZW = 180°. 

But we don't know either of those yet. But maybe we can use the information about the central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, which corresponds to arc ZY. Since V is the center, arc ZY measures 60°, so the inscribed angle over arc ZY would be half of that, which is 30°, but wait. Wait, inscribed angles subtend arcs. For example, an inscribed angle that subtends arc ZY would be half the measure of the arc. But angle at X, ∠ZXY? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, so arc ZY is 60°, so the inscribed angle subtending arc ZY would be 30°. But which angle subtends arc ZY?

An inscribed angle that subtends arc ZY would be an angle whose vertex is on the circumference, and its sides pass through Z and Y. For example, angle at X: ∠ZXY. Wait, ∠ZXY is the angle at X between Z and Y. Wait, but in the quadrilateral, ∠ZXY is ∠ZXY, which is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, but ∠ZXY is ∠XYZ? No, sorry. Let me get back.

Wait, arc ZY is 60°, so the inscribed angle that intercepts arc ZY would be half of that. For instance, if you take a point on the circumference not on arc ZY, then the angle formed by connecting that point to Z and Y would be half the measure of arc ZY. For example, angle at W: ∠ZWY. Wait, but ∠ZWY would intercept arc ZY. Wait, but depending on where the point is.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ZYV, since V is the center. So triangle ZYV is an isosceles triangle with VZ and VY as radii. So ∠ZVY = 60°, making triangle ZYV equilateral? If the two sides VZ and VY are equal (radii), and angle between them is 60°, then triangle ZYV is equilateral. Therefore, ZY is equal to radius? Or maybe not necessarily, but the triangle is equilateral. So that implies that arc ZY is 60°, so the length of chord ZY is equal to the radius. Not sure if that helps directly.

But maybe we can find some angles related to the quadrilateral. Let me consider the angles of the quadrilateral. We know ∠ZWX = 95°, ∠XYZ = 85°, as established before. Also, from the second equation, ∠WXY + ∠YZW = 180°. Let me denote ∠WXY as angle at X, which is what we need to find. Let me call that angle X. Let me call ∠YZW as angle at Z. So angle X + angle Z = 180°.

If we can find angle Z, then we can find angle X. Alternatively, maybe relate it with the central angle given.

Let me think about other angles. Also, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle. But not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. So total angles: ∠ZWX + ∠WXY + ∠XYZ + ∠YZW = 360°. Substituting known values: 95° + angle X + 85° + angle Z = 360°. From before, angle X + angle Z = 180°, so substituting that into the equation:

95 + 85 + 180 = 360. Let me compute: 95+85 is 180, plus 180 makes 360. Yes, that works. So that doesn't give new info. Hence, need more information.

Looking back, the given central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, which relates to arc ZY. How can this help? Maybe looking at inscribed angles that subtend arc ZY. For example, angle at X: ∠ZXY (which is ∠XYZ?), wait, no. Let me think again.

Arc ZY is 60°, so any inscribed angle subtended by arc ZY would be half of that, 30°. Which angles in the quadrilateral subtend arc ZY?

For example, angle at W: if we look at ∠ZWX, which is 95°, does it subtend arc ZY? Let me visualize. In cyclic quadrilaterals, the angle at a vertex subtends the arc opposite to it. Wait, for example, angle at W subtends arc ZY. Because when you have a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle formed at a vertex is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, actually, the formula for an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, in a cyclic quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall.

Actually, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. For example, angle at W (∠ZWX) intercepts arc ZY. Therefore, ∠ZWX = ½(arc ZY). Wait, but arc ZY is 60°, so ∠ZWX should be 30°, but we're told it's 95°. Contradiction? Wait, that suggests something wrong here. Wait, maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle formed at a vertex is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. So for angle at W, which is ∠ZWX, the intercepted arc would be arc ZY. Wait, but if that's true, then ∠ZWX = ½(arc ZY). But arc ZY is 60°, so ∠ZWX should be 30°, but according to the problem, it's 95°. That contradicts. So there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is different. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. Wait, but maybe the intercepted arc is not the arc opposite, but rather the arc that is cut off by the angle. Let me clarify with an example.

Take angle at W (∠ZWX). The sides of this angle are WZ and WX. These two chords intercept an arc that is opposite to the angle. Wait, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is not containing the angle. So in this case, the angle at W intercepts arc ZY. Wait, but if that's the case, then ∠ZWX = ½(arc ZY). But arc ZY is 60°, leading to 30°, conflicting with given value of 95°. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah! Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is not the entire arc ZY, but the arc that's opposite. Wait, but if the quadrilateral is convex and cyclic, then the angle at W intercepts arc ZY, but since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the arc ZY could be major or minor arc. Wait, but the central angle ∠ZVY is 60°, so arc ZY is 60°, which is the minor arc. Therefore, the measure of ∠ZWX should be half of that, 30°, but the problem states it's 95°, which is way bigger. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the rest of the circle. Wait, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle at W intercepts arc ZY, which is 60°, then ∠ZWX would be 30°, but that's not matching. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Wait, maybe the angle at W intercepts the arc that's opposite to it, which isn't just arc ZY. Wait, let me think again. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at W is formed by chords WZ and WX. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that does not contain W. So the intercepted arc would be arc ZY. But if that's 60°, then the angle should be 30°, but it's given as 95°. So this suggests that my previous conclusion that arc ZY is 60° may be incorrect? Or maybe I misunderstood the relation between the central angle and the arc.

Wait, the problem says Angle(Z,V,Y) is 60°, which is the angle at center V between points Z and Y. That is indeed the central angle corresponding to arc ZY. Therefore, arc ZY measures 60°, so that should be correct. But then the angle at W, which is supposed to intercept arc ZY, should be half of that, 30°, but it's given as 95°. So where is the mistake here?

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is not arc ZY, but the other arc that goes around the other side of the circle. For example, if arc ZY is 60°, then the remaining arc ZY going the long way around the circle is 360 - 60 = 300°, and the angle at W would intercept that larger arc. Wait, but inscribed angles always intercept the arc that is less than 180°, unless the angle is obtuse. Wait, no. Actually, an inscribed angle can intercept an arc greater than 180°, but in that case, the angle would be half of that arc. However, if the angle is obtuse, then it would intercept an arc greater than 180°, because half of an arc greater than 180° would be greater than 90°, making the angle obtuse.

Wait, so maybe angle at W intercepts the arc that is not arc ZY, but the opposite arc. Let me think again. When you have a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at a vertex intercepts the arc opposite to it. So for angle at W, the intercepted arc is arc ZY, but if that arc is small (60°), then the angle would be 30°, but if the angle is obtuse, then it must intercept the opposite arc, which would be the large arc ZY. Wait, but the large arc ZY would be 360° - 60° = 300°, so half of that is 150°, which would make the angle at W equal to 150°, which still doesn't match the given 95°. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the intercepted arc. Let me recall that in general, for any inscribed angle, the measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is cut off by the angle's sides. So for angle at W, formed by points Z, W, X, the intercepted arc is the arc from Z to X that doesn't include W. Wait, but that depends on the position of the points.

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinates or assign variables to arcs. Let me try that approach.

Let me denote the arcs between the points on the circle. Let’s assume the circle has points W, X, Y, Z arranged in order around the circle. Since it's a cyclic quadrilateral, the order matters. However, without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. But given that angle at W is 95°, which is quite large, suggesting that the intercepted arc is large. Let me suppose that the arc opposite to angle W is arc ZY, which we've determined is 60°, but that leads to inconsistency. So maybe the intercepted arc is not arc ZY, but another arc.

Wait, angle at W is formed by chords WZ and WX. Therefore, the intercepted arc is arc ZX that does not contain W. Wait, but arc ZX would depend on the arrangement of the points. Suppose the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z around the circle. Then the arc from Z to X not passing through W would go through Y. So arc ZYX. Wait, but that's the arc from Z to X via Y. The measure of that arc would be arc ZY + arc YX. But we know arc ZY is 60°, but we don't know arc YX. Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is arc ZY, but that led to inconsistency. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at W is half the difference of the arcs intercepted by the angle. Wait, no, that's for the case of angles formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, but in this case, the angle is formed by two chords meeting at the circumference.

Wait, I think I need to revisit the basics. For an inscribed angle, the measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for example, if I have angle at W, formed by chords WZ and WX, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, which is arc ZY. Wait, but if that's the case, then ∠ZWX = ½(arc ZY). But arc ZY is 60°, so ∠ZWX should be 30°, but it's given as 95°. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption about which arc is intercepted must be wrong.

Maybe the intercepted arc is not arc ZY, but arc ZY extended? Or perhaps the angle is formed such that it intercepts arc ZY, but since it's an inscribed angle, it's possible that the intercepted arc is the major arc ZY. Wait, if the angle is obtuse, then the intercepted arc must be greater than 180°. Let me calculate: if ∠ZWX = 95°, then the intercepted arc would be 2*95 = 190°. So arc ZY would be 190°, but earlier we thought arc ZY was 60° due to the central angle. So this suggests a conflict. Where is the mistake?

Wait, the central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, which corresponds to arc ZY. So arc ZY must be 60°, regardless of the inscribed angles. So there's a contradiction here, which indicates that my initial assumption about the intercepted arc for ∠ZWX is wrong.

Perhaps the intercepted arc is not arc ZY, but another arc. Let me think again. Let's imagine the cyclic quadrilateral WXYZ. The angle at W (∠ZWX) is formed by points Z, W, X. To determine which arc this angle intercepts, we need to see which arc is opposite. If the quadrilateral is labeled in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then the arc from Z to X not containing W would pass through Y. So the arc ZYX. Wait, but arc ZYX includes arc ZY (60°) and arc YX. So if the total arc from Z to X through Y is 60° + arc YX. Let me denote arc YX as x. Then the measure of arc ZYX is 60° + x. So the inscribed angle ∠ZWX would be half of that arc. So ∠ZWX = ½(60° + x) = 95°. Solving for x: 60 + x = 190 ⇒ x = 130°. So arc YX is 130°.

Therefore, arc YX = 130°, arc ZY = 60°, so the total circumference is 360°, so the remaining arcs would be arc WX and arc XY. Wait, no, let's see. The full circle is made up of arcs WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Wait, but we have arc YX (from Y to X) as 130°, and arc ZY (from Z to Y) as 60°. Wait, maybe I need to better organize the arcs.

Let me denote the arcs between consecutive points:

arc WX = a,

arc XY = b,

arc YZ = c,

arc ZW = d.

Total circumference: a + b + c + d = 360°.

From the central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, which corresponds to arc ZY. Arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y, which would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? Wait, no. If moving from Z to Y along the circle, depending on direction. Assuming the points are in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then arc ZY would go from Z to Y through W and X. Wait, but that would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY. But that would be d + a + b. Alternatively, if moving the other way, arc ZY could be arc ZY directly, which is arc ZY = c (if arc YZ is c, then arc ZY is same as arc YZ). Wait, confusion arises from notation.

Assuming the points are placed in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle. So moving clockwise, the arcs are:

Between W and X: arc WX = a,

Between X and Y: arc XY = b,

Between Y and Z: arc YZ = c,

Between Z and W: arc ZW = d.

Thus, total a + b + c + d = 360°.

Now, arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y, which would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY = d + a + b. Alternatively, the shorter arc from Z to Y would be arc ZY, which is c if we go from Z to Y through the arc that skips W and X. Wait, no. If the points are W, X, Y, Z in order, then arc ZY would be the arc going from Z to Y counterclockwise, which would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY. Or if it's the arc going the other way, it would be arc ZY directly, which is arc YZ (same as arc YZ = c). But since ∠ZVY is the central angle, it depends on which arc it's referring to. The central angle ∠ZVY would correspond to the arc that is opposite to it, which is arc ZY. Depending on the positioning, it could be the smaller or larger arc. Since the central angle is given as 60°, which is acute, it likely refers to the minor arc ZY, meaning that arc ZY is 60°, so c = 60°.

So arc YZ = c = 60°, which is the minor arc.

Earlier, we considered that angle at W, ∠ZWX, intercepts arc ZY, but that led to inconsistency. However, if instead, ∠ZWX intercepts the arc that is opposite, which would be arc ZY, but since that arc is 60°, then ∠ZWX should be 30°, but it's given as 95°, which suggests that the intercepted arc is not arc ZY, but another arc.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, which would be the arc that does not contain the angle's vertex. For angle at W, the intercepted arc would be arc ZY (not containing W), which is arc ZY = 60°, but that gives 30°, not 95°. So this is a contradiction. Hence, there must be an error in assuming that the intercepted arc is arc ZY.

Alternative approach: Use the fact that angle at W is 95°, and it is an inscribed angle. So, it must intercept an arc that is twice that, 190°. So the intercepted arc is 190°, which would mean that arc ZY is 190°, but this conflicts with the central angle giving arc ZY as 60°. So this suggests that the intercepted arc for ∠ZWX is not arc ZY, but another arc.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the arc that spans from Z to X, not passing through W. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then arc ZX not passing through W would go through Y. So arc ZYX, which is arc ZY + arc YX = c + b = 60° + b. So the measure of this arc is 60 + b. Thus, ∠ZWX = ½*(60 + b) = 95°. Solving:

(60 + b)/2 = 95 ⇒ 60 + b = 190 ⇒ b = 130°. So arc YX = 130°.

So now, we know that arc YX is 130°, arc YZ is 60°, and we can proceed.

Now, let's find other arcs. Total circumference is 360°, so:

a + b + c + d = 360°.

We know b = 130°, c = 60°, so a + d = 360 - 130 - 60 = 170°.

Now, what else can we find? Let's look at other angles given.

We also have from the equation Add(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)),MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)),180). Earlier, we said that ∠ZWX + ∠ZYX = 180°. ∠ZYX is the angle at Y between Z and X, which is ∠ZYX. Let me express this angle in terms of arcs.

Angle at Y, ∠ZYX, is formed by points Z, Y, X. So it intercepts arc ZX that does not contain Y. Arc ZX not containing Y would be arc ZW + arc WX = d + a. Therefore, ∠ZYX = ½(d + a). From earlier, we have ∠ZYX = 180 - ∠ZWX = 180 - 95 = 85°. So:

½(d + a) = 85 ⇒ d + a = 170°, which matches our earlier calculation (since a + d = 170°). So this is consistent.

Now, we also have another equation from Add(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)),MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,Y)),180). Let me parse this. ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180°.

∠WXY is the angle at X between W and Y, which is ∠WXY. Let's find its measure. It is formed by points W, X, Y, so it intercepts arc WY that does not contain X. Arc WY not containing X would be arc WZ + arc ZY = d + c = d + 60°. So ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°).

Similarly, ∠WZY is the angle at Z between W and Y, formed by points W, Z, Y. This intercepts arc WY that does not contain Z. Arc WY not containing Z would be arc WX + arc XY = a + b = a + 130°. So ∠WZY = ½(a + 130°).

According to the equation, ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180°. So:

½(d + 60) + ½(a + 130) = 180.

Multiply both sides by 2:

d + 60 + a + 130 = 360 ⇒ a + d + 190 = 360 ⇒ a + d = 170°, which matches our earlier finding that a + d = 170°. So this equation doesn't give new information. Hence, we need another relation.

We need to find angle at X, which is ∠WXY. From above, ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°). So if we can find d or a, we can compute this.

Recall that a + d = 170°. But we need another equation to find individual values of a and d. Let me think.

Is there any other information given? We have the central angle ∠ZVY = 60°, which we already used for arc YZ = 60°, and arc YX = 130°. Are there other central angles or inscribed angles we can use?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of all angles in the quadrilateral is 360°, but we already did that.

Wait, but we also know that in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. So ∠W + ∠Y = 180°, and ∠X + ∠Z = 180°. We already know ∠W = 95°, so ∠Y = 85°, which is consistent with earlier calculation. Now, ∠X + ∠Z = 180°. So if we can find ∠Z, we can find ∠X.

∠Z is the angle at Z, which is ∠YZW. Let's find ∠YZW. This is formed by points Y, Z, W, so it intercepts arc YW that does not contain Z. Arc YW not containing Z would be arc YX + arc XW = b + a = 130 + a. Wait, no. Let me clarify: arc YW not containing Z would be the arc from Y to W that doesn't go through Z. Since points are W, X, Y, Z in order, the arc from Y to W not containing Z would be arc YX + arc XW = b + a. So ∠YZW = ½(b + a) = ½(130 + a). But we know that ∠X + ∠Z = 180°, and ∠X = ∠WXY = ½(d + 60), and ∠Z = ½(b + a) = ½(130 + a). So:

∠X + ∠Z = ½(d + 60) + ½(130 + a) = 180.

But since a + d = 170°, substitute d = 170 - a.

So:

½((170 - a) + 60) + ½(130 + a) = 180

Calculate first term: (170 - a + 60) = 230 - a; divided by 2: (230 - a)/2

Second term: (130 + a)/2

Adding together:

[230 - a + 130 + a]/2 = 360/2 = 180. Which matches. Again, no new information. So we need another way.

Wait, perhaps there's something about the central angle and other arcs. We know arc YZ = 60°, arc YX = 130°, and arc WX = a, arc ZW = d, with a + d = 170°. Is there a way to find a or d?

Wait, maybe using another inscribed angle? Let's see. Are there any other angles given? We have angle at Z, ∠YZW, which we haven't used yet. Or maybe the angle at Z is related to other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc WX or arc ZW. Let me think. If we can find another inscribed angle that involves these arcs.

Wait, what about angle at Z, ∠YZW, which is part of the quadrilateral. We have ∠YZW = ½(b + a) = ½(130 + a). But we also know that ∠X + ∠Z = 180°, and ∠X = ½(d + 60). Since d = 170 - a, substitute:

∠X = ½(170 - a + 60) = ½(230 - a) = 115 - a/2.

And ∠Z = ½(130 + a).

So, ∠X + ∠Z = 115 - a/2 + (130 + a)/2 = 115 - a/2 + 65 + a/2 = 115 + 65 = 180°, which checks out. Still no new info.

Hmm. So we need another equation. Perhaps using the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have some relationships. Let me write down the arcs:

arc WX = a,

arc XY = b = 130°,

arc YZ = c = 60°,

arc ZW = d.

With a + d = 170°.

But we need more info. Wait, maybe there's another angle given? The problem mentions Angle(Z,V,Y) = 60°, which we've already used for arc YZ = 60°. Any others?

Wait, no other angles are given except the ones already used. So perhaps we need to relate other inscribed angles. Let me think about angle at Z. Wait, we might need to use the fact that angle at Z is ∠YZW = ½(130 + a), but we don't know its measure. However, if we can relate it to other parts?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation involving the other arcs. Let me think about the remaining arcs. Since arc WX = a, and arc ZW = d, and a + d = 170°, but without additional info, we can't determine their exact values. So perhaps there's missing info, or maybe we can express ∠X in terms of a, and realize it's independent of a?

Wait, let's recall that ∠X = 115 - a/2. So if we can find a, we can find ∠X. But how?

Wait, is there any other condition? Let me check the problem statement again. Did I miss anything?

The problem says:

- InscribedIn(Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z),Circle(V)).

- PointLiesOnCircle(W,Circle(V)), etc. All points on the circle.

- Given angles:

  - MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X),95) → ∠ZWX = 95°

  - MeasureOf(Angle(Z,V,Y),60) → ∠ZVY = 60°

  - Add(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)),MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)),180) → ∠ZWX + ∠ZYX = 180° → already used.

  - Add(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)),MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,Y)),180) → ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180° → already used.

No other given angles. So perhaps there's a missing piece, or maybe I missed something.

Wait, maybe using the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have:

arc WX = a,

arc XY = 130°,

arc YZ = 60°,

arc ZW = d,

with a + d = 170°.

But we need another equation. Wait, is there any relation between arc WX and arc ZW? Not directly, unless there's symmetry or other conditions. But there's none given.

Wait, unless there's something about the central angles related to other points. For example, maybe the central angle for another arc? Like, if we consider angle at V for other points, but the only given central angle is ∠ZVY = 60°.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express ∠X in terms of the known quantities.

From earlier, ∠X = 115 - a/2. But we need to find a. Let me think about other angles. For example, angle at Z, ∠YZW = ½(130 + a). But how to relate that?

Wait, what if we consider the angle at Z, ∠YZW, and see if it relates to other arcs or angles? For example, maybe there's a relationship with the central angle or other inscribed angles. But I don't see it immediately.

Wait, what if we consider the triangle VWZ or similar triangles? Since V is the center, VW and VZ are radii. So triangle VWZ is isosceles with VW = VZ. But unless we know more about the angles of this triangle, it might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on some triangle. But without lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arc WX and arc ZW. Since a + d = 170°, but without more info, we cannot determine individual values. This suggests that ∠X can vary depending on a, which contradicts the idea that the problem has a unique answer. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. The question asks for m∠X, which is ∠WXY. Earlier, I expressed this as ½(d + 60°). And since a + d = 170°, then d = 170° - a. So ∠X = ½(170 - a + 60) = ½(230 - a) = 115 - a/2.

But we need to find ∠X. Unless there's a way to find a.

Wait, let me think about the arc WX = a and arc ZW = d. Is there any other information about these arcs? For example, maybe relating to other inscribed angles?

Wait, what about the angle at Z, ∠YZW = ½(130 + a). Is there a way to find this angle? If we can find ∠YZW, then since ∠X + ∠Z = 180°, we can find ∠X.

But how?

Wait, is there any other angle given that involves ∠YZW? Let me check the problem again. No, the only given angles are ∠ZWX = 95°, ∠ZVY = 60°, and the two additive equations. So no direct info on ∠YZW.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we know three of them: arc XY = 130°, arc YZ = 60°, and arc WX = a, arc ZW = d = 170 - a. So total is a + 130 + 60 + d = a + d + 190 = 170 + 190 = 360°, which checks out.

Still no help.

Wait, maybe there's something about the arcs that are related to the central angle. For example, if we consider other central angles, but the only given one is ∠ZVY = 60°. Maybe there are other central angles we can derive?

For example, consider the central angle for arc WX. The central angle for arc WX would be ∠WVX. Similarly for other arcs. But we don't have information about these.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that ∠WXY = 115 - a/2, and if we can find another expression for ∠WXY. Let me think.

∠WXY is the angle at X, which is part of the cyclic quadrilateral. Is there a way to relate this angle to other elements? For example, using the fact that it's an inscribed angle, but we already did that.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that ∠WXY is supplementary to ∠WZY. Wait, no, we already used that.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines on the triangles formed by the radii and chords. For example, in triangle VWX, but without knowing any sides or other angles, this might not help.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to connect the given central angle ∠ZVY = 60° with other arcs. For example, if we consider arc WX and arc ZW, but I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, let me try plugging in possible answers to see if it fits. The options are A. 85, B. 95, C. 115, D. 120.

Let me assume that ∠X is one of these values and see if it leads to consistency.

Option C: 115°. Let's assume ∠X = 115°. Then, since ∠X + ∠Z = 180°, ∠Z = 65°. Now, ∠Z is ∠YZW = 65°, which is ½(130 + a) = 65 ⇒ 130 + a = 130 ⇒ a = 0°, which is impossible. So invalid.

Option A: 85°. Then ∠Z = 180 - 85 = 95°. So ∠Z = 95° = ½(130 + a) ⇒ 130 + a = 190 ⇒ a = 60°. So a = 60°, then d = 170 - a = 110°. Let me check if this is possible. With arc WX = 60°, arc XY = 130°, arc YZ = 60°, arc ZW = 110°. Total is 60 + 130 + 60 + 110 = 360°, which is correct. Now, check if this leads to any contradictions.

What about ∠WXY = 85°, which is ∠X. Let's verify if this is consistent with other information. For example, ∠WXY = ½(d + 60) = ½(110 + 60) = ½(170) = 85°, which matches. So this works. So ∠X = 85°, option A. But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Option B: 95°. Then ∠Z = 85°. So ∠Z = 85° = ½(130 + a) ⇒ 130 + a = 170 ⇒ a = 40°. Then d = 170 - 40 = 130°. Check total arcs: 40 + 130 + 60 + 130 = 360°. Correct. Then ∠WXY = ½(d + 60) = ½(130 + 60) = 95°, which matches. So this also works. So both a = 60° and a = 40° lead to valid configurations, giving ∠X as 85° or 95°. But this suggests ambiguity, which is problematic.

Wait, but the problem must have a unique answer. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe there's an additional constraint I missed. Let me reconsider the angle at Z. ∠YZW = 85° in the case where ∠X is 85°, and ∠YZW = 85° in the case where ∠X is 95°. But maybe there's a relation between ∠YZW and other angles.

Wait, let me think about the arc WX = a. If a = 60°, then arc WX is 60°, which is same as arc YZ. If a = 40°, then arc WX is 40°. Is there any reason why one of these is preferred?

Wait, let me think about the central angles. For example, what is the central angle corresponding to arc WX? It would be ∠WVX. Similarly, the central angle for arc ZW is ∠ZVW. But we don't have information about these angles.

However, there's another given angle: ∠ZVY = 60°, which is the central angle for arc ZY. Maybe there's a relation between other central angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I'm missing. Let me think about the fact that ∠WXY = 85° or 95°, depending on a. But how to decide?

Wait, let's recall that in the beginning, we had a contradiction regarding the angle at W being 95° and the arc ZY being 60°. But that contradiction was resolved by realizing that the angle at W intercepts arc ZYX (190°), leading to ∠ZWX = 95°. Now, if we take a = 60°, then arc WX = 60°, which is same as arc ZY. So the arc WX is 60°, and arc ZY is 60°, making the circle symmetric in some way. Whereas if a = 40°, arc WX is 40°, arc ZY is 60°, making it asymmetric. 

But how to choose between them? Let me check if there are any other constraints. For example, in the case where a = 60°, arc WX = 60°, so the central angle ∠WVX = 60°. But we don't have information about this angle. Similarly, if a = 40°, ∠WVX = 40°. 

But the problem gives us another angle: ∠ZVY = 60°. Are there any other central angles that can be derived?

Wait, if arc WX = a, then the central angle ∠WVX = a. Similarly, arc ZW = d, so central angle ∠ZVW = d. 

But without more information, we can't determine these angles. Hence, both solutions are possible, leading to ∠X being either 85° or 95°. But this contradicts the idea of a unique answer. So there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial assumption about the intercepted arc for ∠ZWX. Earlier, I assumed that ∠ZWX intercepts arc ZYX (190°), leading to ∠ZWX = 95°. But if arc ZYX is 190°, then arc ZY is part of it, which is 60°, and arc YX is 130°, as previously determined. So this is consistent. 

But if arc YX is 130°, then the central angle for arc YX would be ∠YVX = 130°. But we don't have information about this angle. However, if we consider the central angles, maybe there's a relation with other given angles?

Wait, the problem mentions that all points are on the circle, but no other central angles are given. So this leaves us with two possible solutions for ∠X: 85° or 95°. But the answer choices include both A and B. However, the problem specifies that the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle, and all points are on the circle. But maybe there's a property I missed that ensures one solution over the other.

Wait, let me consider the possibility that the angle at X is 85°, which would make ∠X = 85°, and ∠Z = 95°, while the angle at W is 95°, and angle at Y is 85°. This would make the quadrilateral have angles 95°, 85°, 95°, 85°, which sums to 360°, and satisfies the cyclic quadrilateral properties. Alternatively, if ∠X is 95°, then ∠Z is 85°, making the angles 95°, 85°, 85°, 95°, also summing to 360°.

Both scenarios are possible, but the problem must have a unique answer. This suggests that there's an error in my analysis.

Wait, going back to the original equations: we had from the equation Add(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)),MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,Y)),180). Which gave us ∠WXY + ∠WZY = 180°. Let me recheck this.

∠WXY is the angle at X, which we've denoted as ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°).

∠WZY is the angle at Z, which we've denoted as ∠WZY = ½(a + 130°).

So ∠WXY + ∠WZY = ½(d + 60) + ½(a + 130) = ½(d + a + 60 + 130) = ½(170 + 190) = ½(360) = 180°, which is satisfied. So this holds for any a, as long as a + d = 170°. Hence, no additional constraints.

This implies that multiple configurations are possible, leading to ∠X being either 85° or 95°, depending on a. But the answer choices include both A and B. However, the problem states that the answer must be selected from the options, and possibly, the correct answer is 85° (option A) or 95° (option B). How to decide?

Wait, let me re-examine the given data. We were told that ∠ZVY = 60°, which is the central angle for arc ZY. If we consider the arc YX = 130°, then the central angle for arc YX would be 130°, which is ∠YVX = 130°. But what about the other arcs?

If arc WX = a = 60°, then ∠WVX = 60°, and arc ZW = d = 110°, so ∠ZVW = 110°. In this case, the central angles would be 60°, 130°, 60°, 110°, totaling 60 + 130 + 60 + 110 = 360°, which is correct.

Alternatively, if arc WX = a = 40°, then ∠WVX = 40°, and arc ZW = d = 130°, so ∠ZVW = 130°. Central angles would be 40°, 130°, 60°, 130°, totaling 40 + 130 + 60 + 130 = 360°, also correct.

Both configurations are valid. Hence, the problem as stated allows for two possible answers. But since this is a standardized test question, there must be a unique answer. This suggests that I made a mistake in interpreting the intercepted arcs.

Wait, let me revisit the calculation of ∠WXY. Earlier, I assumed that ∠WXY intercepts arc WY not containing X, which is arc WZ + arc ZY = d + c = d + 60. But is this correct?

Wait, ∠WXY is the angle at X between W and Y. So it is formed by chords XW and XY. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, which is arc WY not containing X. Since the points are W, X, Y, Z in order, arc WY not containing X would go from W to Y through Z. So arc WZ + arc ZY = d + c = d + 60°. So ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°). This seems correct.

But if arc WY is d + 60°, then in the case where a = 60°, d = 110°, so arc WY = 110 + 60 = 170°, making ∠WXY = 85°, which is option A. In the case where a = 40°, d = 130°, arc WY = 130 + 60 = 190°, making ∠WXY = 95°, which is option B.

But how to determine which is correct? Let me think about the other given angle: ∠ZVY = 60°. Is there any relationship between this angle and other parts?

If we consider the arc YZ = 60°, and arc YX = 130°, then the arc from Y to X is 130°, which is the same as arc from Y to X passing through Z. Wait, no. If arc YX is 130°, that would be the arc from Y to X passing through Z, which is arc YZ + arc ZW + arc WX? No, arc YX passing through Z would be arc YZ + arc ZW + arc WX? No, if the points are W, X, Y, Z in order, then arc from Y to X passing through Z would be arc YZ + arc ZW + arc WX? No, that would be arc YZ (60°) + arc ZW (d) + arc WX (a). But this is not necessary. 

Alternatively, the arc YX is 130°, which is the arc from Y to X not passing through Z, which is arc YX = b = 130°. So this is the arc from Y to X passing through W. So the arc YX is 130°, and arc YZ is 60°, so the arc from Y to Z is 60°, and from Y to X is 130°. 

Now, if we consider the central angle ∠YVX, which is the central angle for arc YX = 130°, so ∠YVX = 130°. Similarly, if we consider the central angle ∠WVZ, which would be arc WZ = d. 

But how does this help? Without additional information, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps there's a property related to the angles in the triangle formed by the center and two points. For example, if we consider triangle VXY, but without knowing the lengths or other angles, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, let me consider the possibility that the problem assumes the quadrilateral is convex and the arcs are in certain directions. But this is too vague.

Given that both options A and B seem possible, but the problem provides them as choices, and in standard tests, usually, such problems have a unique solution, I must have made a mistake in assuming both scenarios are possible. Let me re-examine the initial step where I calculated ∠ZWX = 95°, leading to arc ZYX = 190°, hence arc YX = 130°. But what if the intercepted arc for ∠ZWX is not arc ZYX, but another arc?

Wait, another possibility: the angle at W, ∠ZWX, could be an external angle to the circle, but no, it's an inscribed angle. Or perhaps it's a reflex angle? No, it's given as 95°, which is less than 180°.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the angle at W is 95°, which is an inscribed angle, so it should be half the measure of its intercepted arc. But if it's 95°, then the intercepted arc is 190°, which is possible. But then, this arc is arc ZYX, which is 190°, consisting of arc ZY (60°) and arc YX (130°). This is consistent. So this part is okay.

Now, if we consider the arc YX = 130°, then the central angle for arc YX is 130°, which is ∠YVX = 130°. Now, what about the angle at X, ∠WXY, which is ½(arc WY) = ½(170°) = 85°, if arc WY is 170°. Or if arc WY is 190°, then ∠WXY = 95°. But how to determine arc WY?

Arc WY can be calculated as arc WX + arc XY = a + b = a + 130°, or arc WZ + arc ZY = d + 60°. Both expressions are equal since a + d = 170°, so arc WY = 170 + 60 = 230°? No, wait:

Wait, arc WY can be calculated in two ways: 
1. Going from W to Y through X: arc WX + arc XY = a + 130°.
2. Going from W to Y through Z: arc WZ + arc ZY = d + 60°.

Since a + d = 170°, both expressions are equal to a + 130° = (170 - d) + 130 = 300 - d, or d + 60. Wait, no. Let me substitute a = 170 - d into the first expression: a + 130 = (170 - d) + 130 = 300 - d. The second expression is d + 60. These two are equal only if 300 - d = d + 60 ⇒ 300 - 60 = 2d ⇒ 240 = 2d ⇒ d = 120°. So if d = 120°, then both expressions for arc WY are equal. Otherwise, they are different.

But this suggests that arc WY is not uniquely defined unless d = 120°, which is not necessarily true. Hence, this indicates that my previous assumption that ∠WXY = ½(arc WY) is incorrect, because arc WY can be measured in two ways, and depending on the path, it could be the minor or major arc. 

Wait, but inscribed angle always refers to the arc that is less than 180°, unless the angle is obtuse. Wait, no. An inscribed angle can be formed by two chords, and it intercepts the arc that is opposite to it. If the angle is obtuse, the intercepted arc is greater than 180°. 

So, for ∠WXY, which is 95°, it intercepts the arc WY that is greater than 180°, which would be the arc WY passing through Z, which is d + 60°. So, ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°). But if this arc is greater than 180°, then d + 60 > 180 ⇒ d > 120°. 

Similarly, if the arc WY passing through X is a + 130°, which would be less than 180° if a + 130 < 180 ⇒ a < 50°. But since a + d = 170°, if a < 50°, then d > 120°, which aligns with the previous condition. 

So, the measure of ∠WXY depends on whether the intercepted arc is the major or minor arc. If the angle is obtuse, it intercepts the major arc. 

In our case, ∠WXY is either 85° or 95°, depending on whether it intercepts the minor or major arc. 

But how to determine which one it is? Let me think about the position of the points. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then the arc WY passing through Z is the major arc if d + 60 > 180°. Since d + 60 = d + 60, and d = 170 - a. So, d + 60 = 170 - a + 60 = 230 - a. For this to be greater than 180°, 230 - a > 180 ⇒ a < 50°. 

If a < 50°, then ∠WXY intercepts the major arc WY, and thus ∠WXY = ½(230 - a). If a ≥ 50°, it intercepts the minor arc WY, and ∠WXY = ½(a + 130). 

But since we don't know a, we can't determine this. However, the problem gives us that ∠ZVY = 60°, which is the central angle for arc ZY = 60°. Let me consider the possible values of a.

If a < 50°, then d > 120°, and arc WY major is 230 - a, which is greater than 180°. If a >= 50°, then arc WY major is 230 - a ≤ 180°, so it would be the minor arc. 

But how to determine which scenario applies?

Wait, let's recall that ∠ZWX = 95°, which is an inscribed angle. This angle intercepts arc ZYX, which is 190°, as we calculated. This arc is the major arc ZYX, which is 190°. This suggests that the arc ZYX is major, hence, the points are arranged such that arc ZYX is major. This would imply that the arc ZY is 60°, and arc YX is 130°, making the total arc ZYX = 190°. 

If this is the case, then the arc YX is 130°, which is major arc YX? No, arc YX is 130°, which is the arc from Y to X passing through Z, which is major if it's greater than 180°. But 130° is less than 180°, so it's a minor arc. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, arc YX is 130°, which is the arc from Y to X passing through Z, which is a minor arc. But if it's 130°, then it's a minor arc, and the major arc YX would be 360 - 130 = 230°. 

But how does this relate to the angle at W? The angle at W is 95°, which intercepts the arc ZYX (190°), which is the arc from Z to X passing through Y, which is a major arc. 

This suggests that the configuration is such that the arc YX is 130° (minor), and arc ZY is 60° (minor). 

Now, returning to ∠WXY. If the arc WY passing through Z is d + 60°, and if this is a major arc, then it would be greater than 180°. For this to be true, d + 60 > 180 ⇒ d > 120°. Since d = 170 - a, this implies 170 - a > 120 ⇒ a < 50°. 

If a < 50°, then ∠WXY = ½(230 - a) = 115 - a/2. But since a < 50°, this would give ∠WXY > 115 - 25 = 90°, and since a can be as low as 0°, ∠WXY can range from 115° to 115 - 0 = 115°. Wait, no, if a approaches 0, then ∠WXY = 115 - 0/2 = 115°. If a approaches 50°, then ∠WXY = 115 - 50/2 = 115 - 25 = 90°. So ∠WXY ranges from 90° to 115°.

But earlier, we had two cases: when a = 60°, ∠WXY = 85°, and when a = 40°, ∠WXY = 95°. Wait, this suggests that my previous calculation was incorrect. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, earlier, I said that ∠WXY = ½(d + 60°), where d = 170 - a. So ∠WXY = ½(170 - a + 60) = ½(230 - a) = 115 - a/2. If a = 60°, then ∠WXY = 115 - 30 = 85°. If a = 40°, ∠WXY = 115 - 20 = 95°. But if a < 50°, then ∠WXY > 90°, and if a > 50°, then ∠WXY < 90°. But this contradicts the previous calculation where a = 60° (which is > 50°) gives ∠WXY = 85° < 90°. 

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption about the intercepted arc for ∠WXY is wrong. If a > 50°, then the arc WY passing through Z (d + 60) is 170 - a + 60 = 230 - a. If a > 50°, then 2
