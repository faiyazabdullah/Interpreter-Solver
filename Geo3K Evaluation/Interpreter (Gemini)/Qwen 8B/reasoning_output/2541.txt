====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the measure of angle A in this quadrilateral ABCD. The problem gives some constraints. Let me start by recalling that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. That seems important here.

The problem states that angles B and C are right angles, so each of those is 90 degrees. Then, angle A is three times some value x, and angle D is x. So, they're saying measure of angle A equals 3x, and measure of angle D equals x. 

Let me write down the equations based on the given information. Let me denote:

Measure of Angle A = 3x  
Measure of Angle B = 90° (since it's a right angle)  
Measure of Angle C = 90° (same reason)  
Measure of Angle D = x  

And the sum of all four angles should be 360°, as per the formula for quadrilaterals. So adding them up:

3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360

Combine like terms. The 3x and x make 4x. Then the two 90s add up to 180. So:

4x + 180 = 360

Subtract 180 from both sides:

4x = 180

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 45

So then, measure of angle A is 3x, which would be 3 * 45 = 135 degrees. 

Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify the steps. The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is indeed 360. Angles B and C are each 90°, so that's 180° total. Then angles A and D add up to 360 - 180 = 180°. But according to the problem, angle A is 3x and angle D is x, so their sum is 4x. Therefore, 4x = 180 => x=45. Hence angle A is 3*45=135°. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 135. So the answer should be C. 

But wait, let me check if there's anything else. Are there any other constraints? For example, does the fact that angles B and C are right angles affect the shape in a way that might change things? Like, maybe making it a rectangle or something? Wait, no. Because in a rectangle, all angles are 90°, but here angles A and D are variable. However, since angles B and C are right angles, but A and D aren't necessarily. So the quadrilateral isn't a rectangle. It could be a trapezoid or some other shape. But regardless, the sum of the angles still has to be 360. So my calculation holds. 

Another thing: Maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the sum is 360? Let me recall. Yes, for any quadrilateral, whether convex or concave, the sum of the interior angles is always 360 degrees. So that part is correct. 

Therefore, solving for x gives x=45, leading to angle A being 135°, which is option C. 

I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning. So final answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle A$ in quadrilateral $ABCD$, we begin by applying fundamental geometric principles about polygons. Specifically, the **sum of the interior angles** of a quadrilateral is always:

$$
\text{Sum} = 360^\circ
$$

---

### Step 1: Analyze Given Information

From the problem, we know the following:

- $\angle B$ and $\angle C$ are **right angles**, i.e., 
  $$
  \angle B = \angle C = 90^\circ
  $$
- $\angle A = 3x$
- $\angle D = x$

We are also told:

$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation

Substitute known values into the equation:

$$
3x + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x = 360^\circ
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
4x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $x$

$$
4x = 360^\circ - 180^\circ = 180^\circ
$$
$$
x = \frac{180^\circ}{4} = 45^\circ
$$

Now substitute back to find $\angle A$:

$$
\angle A = 3x = 3 \times 45^\circ = 135^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
