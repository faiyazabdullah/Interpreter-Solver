Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have several points and triangles defined here. Let me try to visualize it first. 

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D, E. There are two triangles: Triangle(A,D,E) and Triangle(B,C,E). Then there are lines connecting various points: Line(A,D), Line(D,E), Line(A,E), Line(B,C), Line(C,E), Line(B,E), and Line(A,B). Also, angles are mentioned like Angle(D,A,E), Angle(A,D,E), etc. Plus some equations that set sums of angle measures equal to 180 degrees. And then there's this part about equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2))) and equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(1))). The question asks for the measure of angle 2.

First, I need to figure out which angles these refer to. Let me break down the given information step by step.

Starting with the triangles:

1. Triangle ADE: So points A, D, E form a triangle. Therefore, the angles at each vertex would be Angle at A (between AD and AE?), Angle at D (between DA and DE?), and Angle at E (between ED and EA?).

Similarly, Triangle BCE: Points B, C, E form another triangle. Angles here would be at B, C, E.

Now looking at the lines:

- Line AD connects A and D.
- Line DE connects D and E.
- Line AE connects A and E. Wait, so triangle ADE has sides AD, DE, AE. That makes sense.

For triangle BCE, lines BC, CE, BE. So points connected as B-C, C-E, E-B.

Also, there's a line AB connecting A and B. So point A is connected to B, which might imply that AB is a side of another shape?

But maybe the key is the angles mentioned. Let me note the angles:

Given angles:

- Angle(D,A,E): This is the angle at point A between points D and E. So vertex at A, with segments AD and AE. So that's angle DAE.

Then Angle(A,D,E): Vertex at D, between A and E. So angle at D between AD and DE. Which would be angle ADE.

Angle(D,E,A): Vertex at E between D and A. So angle DEA.

So those three angles make up triangle ADE. And their sum should be 180 degrees. Similarly, for triangle BCE, angles at C, E, B. Wait, the problem says:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A))) = 180. So that's the three angles of triangle ADE adding up to 180, which checks out.

Same for the other triangle: SumOf(Angle(B,C,E), Angle(E,B,C), Angle(C,E,B)) = 180. So those are the three angles of triangle BCE.

Additionally, there are equalities:

MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(2)). So angle DAE equals angle 2.

MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(1)). So angle CEB equals angle 1.

We also have angles labeled as Angle(1) and Angle(2) and Angle(3). But the question is asking for angle 2.

Wait, but how do these angles relate? Are there any other relationships or constraints? Maybe we need to find relations between these angles using the given equations and perhaps triangle properties.

Let me write down the knowns:

From triangle ADE:

Angle DAE + Angle ADE + Angle DEA = 180°

Which is equivalent to:

Angle(D,A,E) + Angle(A,D,E) + Angle(D,E,A) = 180°, which is given.

Similarly, for triangle BCE:

Angle(B,C,E) + Angle(E,B,C) + Angle(C,E,B) = 180°, given.

Moreover, Angle(D,A,E) = Angle(2), and Angle(C,E,B) = Angle(1). So substituting:

In triangle ADE:

Angle(2) + Angle(A,D,E) + Angle(D,E,A) = 180°

But wait, Angle(A,D,E) is angle at D, which is angle ADE. And Angle(D,E,A) is angle at E, which is angle DEA. So those are two angles in triangle ADE, and angle DAE is angle 2.

Similarly, for triangle BCE:

Angle(B,C,E) is angle at E, which is angle BEC. Angle(E,B,C) is angle at B, which is angle EBC. Angle(C,E,B) is angle at C, which is angle ECB. So:

Angle(B,C,E) + Angle(E,B,C) + Angle(C,E,B) = 180° → angle BEC + angle EBC + angle ECB = 180°, and since angle(C,E,B) is angle ECB, which equals angle 1.

So angle ECB = angle 1.

But how does this help us? We need more relations between these angles. Perhaps considering other parts of the diagram?

Wait, there's also the line AB. Since points A and B are connected by a line. So maybe there's a quadrilateral or another triangle involving AB?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between angles from different triangles? For example, maybe points A, B, C, D, E form some intersecting lines or something else?

Alternatively, could there be vertical angles, supplementary angles, or something else due to intersecting lines?

Looking back at the lines:

Lines AD, DE, AE form triangle ADE. Lines BC, CE, BE form triangle BCE. Also, line AB connects A and B. Is there a way to connect these triangles?

Perhaps points A, B, C, D, E are arranged such that lines AD, AE, BE, BC, CE, etc., create overlapping structures?

Wait, maybe there's a common point E. Both triangles share point E. Also, point C is connected to E and B, and point D is connected to A and E.

Is there a possibility that lines AD and BE intersect somewhere? Or maybe lines AB and CE intersect?

Alternatively, maybe there are some transversal lines or parallel lines involved?

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Let me try to imagine or sketch mentally.

Points A and D connected, D and E connected, A and E connected. So triangle ADE.

Points B and C connected, C and E connected, B and E connected. So triangle BCE.

Also, line AB connects A and B. So perhaps points A and B are connected, forming a separate line.

But without knowing exact positions, maybe we can use the given angle equalities and the fact that certain angles are equal to angle 1 and angle 2.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(2) and Angle(3). However, only Angle(1) and Angle(2) are referenced in the equations. The third angle is just named Angle(3). Not sure yet.

But our goal is to find measure of angle 2, which is equal to angle DAE (from earlier). So if we can express angle DAE in terms of other angles, or find equations involving angle 2, that could help.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the two triangles through point E. Since both triangles share point E.

Wait, in triangle ADE, angle at E is angle DEA. In triangle BCE, angle at E is angle BEC. If lines AE and BE meet at E, then maybe those angles at E are related?

If lines AE and BE meet at E, then the sum of angles around point E might involve those angles. But unless they are linear pairs or something.

Wait, let's consider the angles at point E. From triangle ADE, angle DEA is one angle. From triangle BCE, angle BEC is another angle. Depending on how the lines are arranged, those angles could add up to something.

But unless there's more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe lines AD and BC are related? Or AB and CD?

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line or something. Wait, line AB is present, but no other lines mentioned except those already listed.

Wait, perhaps there's a larger structure. For instance, if points A, B, C, D, E are arranged such that lines AD and BC meet at E? Or maybe lines AB and CD intersect?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADE and triangle BCE share some common angles or sides?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the fact that the sum of angles in each triangle is 180°, and set up equations.

But we need more relations. Let me check again the given constraints.

We know that:

1. In triangle ADE: angle DAE (which is angle 2) + angle ADE + angle DEA = 180°

2. In triangle BCE: angle BEC (which is angle B,C,E?) Wait, angle(B,C,E) is angle at E, so angle BEC. And angle(E,B,C) is angle at B, which is angle EBC. And angle(C,E,B) is angle at C, which is angle ECB. And angle ECB = angle 1.

So, angle BEC + angle EBC + angle ECB = 180°, so angle BEC (angle B,C,E) + angle EBC (angle E,B,C) + angle ECB (angle C,E,B) = 180°, and angle ECB is angle 1.

So angle BEC + angle EBC + angle1 = 180°.

But how does this help?

Unless there's a relation between angle BEC and angle DEA or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle ABE? Because line AB is connected, and lines AE and BE are connected.

Wait, line AE exists (from A to E), line BE exists (from B to E). So points A, B, E are connected via lines AE and BE, and AB. So triangle ABE is formed. So triangle ABE has vertices A, B, E.

In triangle ABE, the angles at A, B, E. Let's see:

At point A: angle between BA and AE. At point B: angle between AB and BE. At point E: angle between AE and BE.

But we don't have direct info on these angles, but maybe we can express them in terms of other angles.

Alternatively, since angle DAE is part of triangle ADE and angle EBC is part of triangle BCE, maybe there's some relation through the lines?

Wait, angle DAE is angle at A between DA and AE. And angle EBC is angle at B between EB and BC. Unless there's some symmetry or proportionality.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or similar triangles?

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Let me try to imagine points:

Assume point E is common to both triangles ADE and BCE. Suppose that lines AD and BC meet at some point? Or maybe lines AB and EC cross?

Alternatively, perhaps points A, B, C, D, E lie on a circle? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the lines AD and BC are parallel? But there's no mention of that.

Alternatively, think about the angles around point A and point B.

At point A, there are lines AD and AE (from triangle ADE) and line AB (connecting to B). So angles at point A include angle DAE (which is angle 2), and possibly other angles if there are other lines meeting at A. For example, angle between AB and AD, or AB and AE.

Wait, but we don't know anything about the angle between AB and AD or AB and AE. Unless there's some information missing.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem gives several lines: Line(A,D), Line(D,E), Line(A,E), Line(B,C), Line(C,E), Line(B,E), Line(A,B). So lines AD, DE, AE, BC, CE, BE, AB.

So, in addition to the triangles, these lines form multiple connections. Let me think about possible intersections or configurations.

For instance, line AB connects A and B. Line BE connects B and E. So points A, B, E are connected. Similarly, line AE connects A and E, so A, E, D are connected. Line DE connects D and E. So E is connected to D and A and B and C (through CE and BE). So point E is connected to four points: A, D, B, C.

Therefore, point E is connected to A, D, B, C. So, in terms of angles at E:

- Between A and D: angle DEA (part of triangle ADE)
- Between D and B: depends on the arrangement
- Between B and C: angle BEC (part of triangle BCE)
- Between C and A: ?

Wait, but point E is connected to A, D, B, C. So the angles around point E would be between those lines. However, without knowing the order of the points around E, it's hard to say. For example, if the lines are arranged in order A-E-D, B-E-C, then angles at E would be between A-E-D, B-E-C, and others depending on the configuration.

But without knowing the exact diagram, this is challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to assume that the lines are arranged such that certain angles are adjacent or supplementary.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at E from triangles ADE and BCE are supplementary or something.

Wait, suppose that lines AD and BC are on opposite sides of line AE and BE. Not sure.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABE. As mentioned before, triangle ABE has angles at A, B, E. Let's denote those angles as follows:

At point A: angle between BA and AE. Let's call this angle x.

At point B: angle between AB and BE. Call this angle y.

At point E: angle between AE and BE. Call this angle z.

So, x + y + z = 180°.

But how does this relate to other angles?

Well, angle DAE is part of triangle ADE. Angle DAE is the angle at A between DA and AE. Which would be angle between DA and AE. If line AB is connected to A, then angle between DA and AB plus angle between AB and AE equals angle DAB? Wait, but we don't know if AB and DA are connected directly. Wait, line AD connects A and D, line AB connects A and B. So at point A, there are two lines: AD and AB. So the angle between AD and AB is part of the diagram, but we don't have specific info about that.

However, angle DAE is the angle between DA and AE. So if we can relate angle DAE to other angles at A.

Suppose that at point A, the lines are AD, AE, and AB. So the total angles around A would depend on how these lines are arranged. For example, if AB is in the same plane as AD and AE, then the angles would add up accordingly.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult to proceed. Maybe there's another approach.

Since we have two triangles with their internal angles summing to 180°, and some angle equalities, maybe we can set up equations based on that.

Let me define variables:

Let’s assign variables to the unknown angles.

Let’s denote:

In triangle ADE:

- Angle at A: angle DAE = angle 2 (given)
- Angle at D: angle ADE = let's call it α
- Angle at E: angle DEA = let's call it β

So, equation 1: 2 + α + β = 180° → α + β = 180° - 2.

In triangle BCE:

- Angle at E: angle BEC = let's call it γ
- Angle at B: angle EBC = let's call it δ
- Angle at C: angle ECB = angle 1 (given)

Equation 2: γ + δ + 1 = 180° → γ + δ = 180° - 1.

Now, we need to find relations between these variables. How?

Maybe there's a connection between α, β, γ, δ?

If we consider point E, which is connected to A, D, B, C. So the angles around E may add up to 360°, assuming it's a planar figure.

Wait, around point E, the sum of angles should be 360°. The angles at point E would include:

- angle DEA (β) from triangle ADE,
- angle BEC (γ) from triangle BCE,
- and possibly other angles if there are more lines connected to E.

Wait, point E is connected to A, D, B, C. So the lines EA, ED, EB, EC. Thus, the angles around point E would be between these lines.

Assuming the lines are arranged in order around E, the angles between each pair of consecutive lines would add up to 360°.

But without knowing the order, it's tricky. However, if we assume that the lines EA, EB, EC, ED are arranged around E in some order, then the sum of the angles between each pair would be 360°.

For example, suppose the order around E is A, B, C, D. Then the angles between EA and EB, EB and EC, EC and ED, ED and EA. But we don't know the actual configuration.

Alternatively, maybe there are some adjacent angles. For instance, angle DEA (β) is between ED and EA. Angle BEC (γ) is between EB and EC. If the lines ED and EB are adjacent, then angle between ED and EB would be β + γ or something?

This seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the lines AD and BC intersect at some point? Or maybe lines AB and DC intersect?

Alternatively, think about triangle ABE and triangle CBE or something else.

Alternatively, think about the entire diagram having some symmetry or special properties.

Alternatively, since angle DAE = angle 2 and angle ECB = angle 1, and we need to find angle 2, maybe there's a way to express angle 2 in terms of angle 1 or vice versa, using the given equations.

But we need more relationships. Let me think about the angles at point E again.

If we consider the angles around E, including those from triangles ADE and BCE, and possibly others.

For instance, angle DEA (β) is between ED and EA. Angle BEC (γ) is between EB and EC. If lines ED and EC are connected, then there might be an angle between ED and EC. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through E, making some angles supplementary.

Alternatively, consider that line AE is connected to E, and line BE is connected to E, forming angle AEB (z in previous notation). Then angle AEB is part of triangle ABE.

But angle AEB could be related to angles β and γ?

Wait, if we look at angle between EA and EB, which is angle AEB. This angle could be composed of other angles if there are lines passing through E.

For example, if there's a line EC, then angle AEB could be split into angle AEC and angle CEB (γ). But unless there's more info, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, suppose that line EC splits angle AEB into two parts: angle AEC and angle CEB (which is γ). Then angle AEB = angle AEC + γ.

But angle AEC would be related to angle DEA (β)? If line EC connects E to C, and line ED connects E to D, then angle between ED and EC would be something else.

This seems too speculative. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, going back to the problem, we have two equations:

1. α + β = 180° - 2 (from triangle ADE)
2. γ + δ = 180° - 1 (from triangle BCE)

And we need to find angle 2, which is the value of angle DAE.

But we need more equations. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, maybe there are other triangles or relationships involving angle 1 and angle 2?

Alternatively, think about triangle ABE. Let me try to define its angles.

As mentioned earlier, in triangle ABE:

- At A: angle between BA and AE. Let's call this angle x.
- At B: angle between AB and BE. Call this angle y.
- At E: angle between AE and BE. Call this angle z.

So, x + y + z = 180°.

But how does x relate to angle DAE (which is angle 2)?

At point A, angle DAE is between DA and AE. If line AB is connected to A, then angle between DA and AB plus angle between AB and AE equals angle DAE (if they are adjacent). Wait, that might be possible.

Assume that at point A, the lines AD, AB, and AE are arranged such that angle between DA and AB is some value, and angle between AB and AE is another value, adding up to angle DAE.

But unless we have info about the other angles, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, if line AB is connected to A, and line AD is connected to A, then angle between AD and AB is something, and angle between AB and AE is something else.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's still unclear.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to link angle DAE (angle 2) with angle EBC (angle 1). For example, if there's a transversal or alternate interior angles?

Alternatively, maybe considering that angle DAE and angle EBC are corresponding angles or something, but that requires parallel lines.

But unless there's information about parallelism, this is uncertain.

Wait, but the problem states that there are several lines and points, but no mention of parallel lines or congruent triangles. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? For example, if points A, B, C, D lie on a circle, but again, no info.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think again about what's given.

We have two triangles with their angles summing to 180°, and two equality conditions between angles. The question asks for angle 2, which is equal to angle DAE.

Is there a way to relate angle DAE to other angles through the rest of the diagram?

Wait, let's consider that both triangles ADE and BCE share the point E. Maybe there's a way to express angle at E in terms of other angles.

In triangle ADE, angle at E is β (angle DEA). In triangle BCE, angle at E is γ (angle BEC). These two angles at E could be supplementary if lines AD and BC are on opposite sides of line AE or something. But again, without knowing the configuration, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if lines AD and BC are parallel, then maybe there are some angle relations. For example, if AD || BC, then angle DAE would be equal to angle EBC (since they would be alternate interior angles). But we don't know if AD is parallel to BC.

But if that were the case, then angle DAE (angle 2) would equal angle EBC (angle δ in triangle BCE). Wait, angle EBC is δ, which was part of the equation γ + δ = 180° - 1. So if angle δ = angle 2, then γ = 180° - 1 - δ = 180° - 1 - angle 2.

But then, how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, if AD is parallel to BC, then angle DAE (at A) would be equal to angle EBC (at B), because they are alternate interior angles. That would mean angle 2 = angle δ.

But then, in triangle BCE, we have γ + δ + 1 = 180°, so γ = 180° - δ - 1. If we can relate γ to something else...

But how?

If AD is parallel to BC, then maybe there's a transversal line that creates other angles. For example, line BE could be a transversal cutting AD and BC, creating corresponding angles. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if we assume that AD is parallel to BC, then maybe we can find relationships between other angles.

But since the problem didn't state that AD is parallel to BC, this assumption might not hold. However, since we're stuck, maybe this is a necessary assumption to proceed?

Let me try this path.

Assume AD is parallel to BC.

Then, since AD || BC, and line BE is a transversal, then angle between AD and BE (which is angle ABE) would be equal to angle between BC and BE (which is angle EBC).

Wait, angle ABE is at point B, between AB and BE. And angle EBC is at point B, between EB and BC. So if AD || BC, and BE is a transversal, then angle between AD and BE (which would be angle ABD if D is extended, but not sure) might relate to angle EBC.

Actually, if AD || BC and BE intersects them, then angle between BE and AD (let's call it θ) would be equal to angle between BE and BC (which is angle EBC). So angle EBC = θ.

But angle θ is also related to angle DAE.

Because if AD || BC, then the angle between AD and AE (which is angle DAE) would be equal to the angle between BC and AE (since AE is a transversal). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, if AD || BC, then angle DAE (at A) and angle EBC (at B) would be alternate interior angles if AE and BE are transversals. But this requires that AE and BE are transversals crossing the parallel lines AD and BC.

Wait, AE connects A to E, and BE connects B to E. If AD || BC, and AE and BE are transversals, then maybe angle DAE (at A) and angle EBC (at B) are equal.

Yes! If AD || BC, and AE and BE are transversals, then angle DAE and angle EBC would be alternate interior angles. Hence, angle DAE = angle EBC.

So, angle 2 = angle δ (which is angle EBC).

Earlier, we had in triangle BCE: γ + δ + 1 = 180°, so γ = 180° - δ - 1.

Now, if we can relate γ to something else, perhaps.

Looking back at triangle ADE, we have α + β = 180° - 2.

What about angle β (angle DEA) and angle γ (angle BEC)?

If lines AE and BE meet at E, then the sum of angles around E might include β and γ. Assuming that the lines ED, EC, EB, EA are arranged around E, then the sum of angles around E would be 360°.

Assuming that the angles around E are β (angle DEA), γ (angle BEC), and other angles.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that ED and EC are on opposite sides of line EB, then angle between ED and EB would be β + γ, or something similar.

Alternatively, if lines ED and EC are on the same side, then maybe β + γ = something.

But this is too vague. Let me think differently.

If angle DAE = angle EBC (angle 2 = δ), then in triangle BCE, we have γ + δ + 1 = 180° → γ = 180° - δ - 1 = 180° - angle 2 - 1.

Now, what about angle γ (angle BEC)? It might be related to angle β (angle DEA) from triangle ADE.

If lines AE and BE meet at E, and if there's a straight line through E, then angle DEA (β) and angle BEC (γ) could be supplementary or something. For example, if ED and EC are on opposite sides of line EB, then β + γ = 180°.

But why would that be the case? If ED and EC are in opposite directions relative to EB, then yes. But this is an assumption.

Assuming β + γ = 180°, then:

β = 180° - γ.

Substituting γ from above:

β = 180° - (180° - angle 2 - 1) = angle 2 + 1.

So β = angle 2 + 1.

Now, recall from triangle ADE, α + β = 180° - angle 2.

So α = 180° - angle 2 - β = 180° - angle 2 - (angle 2 + 1) = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

Now, what is α? Alpha is angle ADE from triangle ADE.

Is there a way to relate alpha to something else?

Alpha is angle at D in triangle ADE, which is between AD and DE. If we can find another expression for alpha.

Maybe looking at triangle ABD or something else?

Wait, there's a line AB connecting A and B. So, if we consider triangle ABD, but we don't have enough information about it.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving point D and B.

Alternatively, think about line BD? But there's no line BD mentioned in the constraints.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ADE and triangle BCD or something.

This seems stuck again. Maybe there's another relation.

Wait, let's recap what we have:

From the assumption that AD || BC, leading to angle 2 = angle δ.

From that, we derived β = angle 2 + 1.

From triangle ADE: α + β = 180° - angle 2.

Thus, α = 180° - angle 2 - β = 180° - angle 2 - (angle 2 + 1) = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

Now, if we can find another equation involving α, then we can solve for angle 2.

But how?

Maybe alpha is part of another triangle or angle.

Wait, alpha is angle ADE, which is part of triangle ADE. What about triangle ADB or something else?

If there's a line from D to B, but there's no such line mentioned. So maybe not.

Alternatively, if we consider the line from D to B, but since it's not mentioned, we can't assume it exists.

Alternatively, think about triangle DBE or something.

But without knowing about other lines, this is speculative.

Wait, but there is a line BE, which connects B to E. So, in triangle BDE, we have points B, D, E. Let's explore that.

In triangle BDE, angles at B, D, E.

At point D: angle between BD and DE. But we don't know about BD.

At point E: angle between BE and DE. Which would be angle BED.

At point B: angle between BE and BD.

Again, without knowing about BD, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if we consider that line AB is connected, and line AD is connected, and line BE is connected.

Wait, let me think about the entire figure again. Points A, D, E form triangle ADE. Points B, C, E form triangle BCE. Line AB connects A and B. If AD || BC, then as we assumed earlier, angle DAE = angle EBC (angle 2 = δ).

If we can relate alpha (angle ADE) with something else.

Wait, if AD || BC, then angle ADE (alpha) would be equal to angle BCE (angle at C in triangle BCE, which is angle ECB = angle 1). Because if AD || BC, then angle between AD and DE (alpha) would be equal to angle between BC and CE (angle ECB = angle 1), since they are alternate interior angles.

Yes! If AD || BC, and DE is a transversal, then angle between AD and DE (alpha) would be equal to angle between BC and DE. But BC is connected to C and E. Wait, BC is connected to B and C, and CE connects C to E. So if DE is a transversal, then the angle between AD and DE (alpha) would be equal to the angle between BC and DE, which would be angle BCE (angle at C, which is angle ECB = angle 1).

So alpha = angle 1.

Ah! So alpha = angle 1.

So, from earlier, we had alpha = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

But alpha = angle 1, so:

angle 1 = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

So angle 1 + 2*angle 2 = 179°.

Now, what else do we know about angle 1?

In triangle BCE, we had:

gamma + delta + angle 1 = 180°, where gamma = angle BEC and delta = angle EBC = angle 2.

So gamma + angle 2 + angle 1 = 180° → gamma = 180° - angle 2 - angle 1.

But earlier, we also had beta = angle 2 + 1, and from the assumption that beta + gamma = 180°, which gave us beta = 180° - gamma.

Wait, earlier, we assumed beta + gamma = 180°, which came from assuming that angles at E, beta and gamma, are supplementary. But why?

If lines ED and EC are on opposite sides of line BE, then beta (angle DEA) and gamma (angle BEC) would be supplementary. But this is an assumption. However, if we made that assumption, then beta + gamma = 180°, which allows us to relate beta and gamma.

So beta = 180° - gamma.

But beta = angle 2 + 1, and gamma = 180° - angle 2 - angle 1.

So:

beta = 180° - gamma → angle 2 + 1 = 180° - (180° - angle 2 - angle 1) = angle 2 + angle 1.

So angle 2 + 1 = angle 2 + angle 1 → subtract angle 2 from both sides: 1 = angle 1.

So angle 1 = 1 degree?

That seems very small, but mathematically, it suggests angle 1 is 1°. But then, from earlier, angle 1 + 2*angle 2 = 179°, so substituting angle 1 = 1°:

1 + 2*angle 2 = 179 → 2*angle 2 = 178 → angle 2 = 89°.

But none of the answer choices are 89. The options are 23, 24, 28, 33. So this suggests that my assumptions may be incorrect.

Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Let me trace back. I assumed AD || BC, leading to angle DAE = angle EBC (angle 2 = delta), and also angle ADE = angle ECB (alpha = angle 1). Then I used the assumption that beta + gamma = 180°, leading to angle 1 = 1°, which seems odd. But maybe that assumption about beta + gamma being supplementary is incorrect.

Let me reconsider the assumption that beta + gamma = 180°. Why did I make that?

I thought that if ED and EC are on opposite sides of BE, then beta and gamma would be supplementary. But this is not necessarily true unless there's a straight line. Without knowing the exact configuration, this assumption might be invalid.

So, maybe the error lies in assuming beta + gamma = 180°. Let's drop that assumption and see.

So, we have:

From triangle ADE: alpha + beta = 180° - angle 2.

From triangle BCE: gamma + delta + angle 1 = 180°, with delta = angle 2.

Also, from the parallel lines assumption, alpha = angle 1.

So angle 1 = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

But we need another equation to relate angle 1 and angle 2.

Where else could we get such an equation?

Maybe from the angles around point E?

Around point E, the sum of all angles should be 360°. The angles around E are:

- angle DEA (beta)
- angle BEC (gamma)
- angle AED (wait, no, that's the same as beta?)
Wait, point E is connected to A, D, B, C. So the angles around E are:

Between EA and ED: angle DEA (beta)
Between ED and EB: let's call this theta
Between EB and EC: angle BEC (gamma)
Between EC and EA: let's call this phi

So, beta + theta + gamma + phi = 360°.

But without knowing theta and phi, this doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through E, like if ED and EC are on a straight line, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving E and other points.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABE and triangle CBE.

Wait, in triangle ABE, we have angles x, y, z as before. And in triangle CBE, we have angles gamma, delta, angle 1.

But how to relate them?

Alternatively, think about line AE and BE, and how they interact with other lines.

This seems too open-ended. Maybe there's another approach.

Let me revisit the equations I had:

From alpha = angle 1 = 180° - 2*angle 2 - 1.

And from triangle BCE: gamma + angle 2 + angle 1 = 180° → gamma = 180° - angle 2 - angle 1.

If I substitute angle 1 from the first equation into this:

gamma = 180° - angle 2 - (180° - 2*angle 2 - 1) = 180° - angle 2 - 180° + 2*angle 2 + 1 = (angle 2) + 1.

So gamma = angle 2 + 1.

Now, what else can we say about gamma?

Gamma is angle BEC, which is part of triangle BCE. Is there any relation between gamma and other angles?

Maybe if we consider triangle BEC and triangle DEA?

Not sure. Or maybe triangle ADE and some other triangle.

Alternatively, think about line EC and line ED. If there's a triangle involving E, D, C, but no line DC is mentioned.

Wait, there's no line DC mentioned, so we cannot assume that. So, no.

Alternatively, think about the entire diagram and the sum of all angles.

But without more info, it's hard.

Wait, let me think about the initial assumption that AD || BC leading to alpha = angle 1. If that's valid, then even though it led to angle 1 = 1°, which seems unlikely, but perhaps it's correct, and the answer is 89°, which isn't among the choices. So this suggests that the assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. For example, if angle 1 and angle 2 are related through some other means.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(3). But we haven't used that. The problem lists Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3). But the only ones mentioned in the equations are Angle(1) and Angle(2). Maybe Angle(3) is related to something else?

Wait, the problem says:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A))), 180)

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B))), 180)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)))

Angle(1)

Angle(2)

Angle(3)"

So, Angle(1), Angle(2), and Angle(3) are defined, but only Angle(1) and Angle(2) are used in the equations. Angle(3) is mentioned but not used. So maybe Angle(3) is another angle in the diagram, but we don't have info about it.

Maybe there's a typo or missing info? Or perhaps Angle(3) is related to the other angles?

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the three angles 1, 2, 3 are the three angles in some triangle or something, but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my earlier steps. Let me recheck.

From the assumption AD || BC, we had:

- angle DAE = angle EBC => angle 2 = delta (angle EBC)
- angle ADE = angle ECB => alpha = angle 1

From triangle ADE: alpha + beta = 180° - angle 2

From triangle BCE: gamma + delta + angle 1 = 180°

From the assumption that beta + gamma = 180°, which led to angle 1 = 1°, which seems problematic.

But if instead, beta + gamma = something else?

Wait, if we don't assume beta + gamma = 180°, but instead, consider that beta and gamma are parts of the angles around E.

If the sum of all angles around E is 360°, and we have beta (angle DEA), gamma (angle BEC), and other angles.

But without knowing the other angles, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through E, like if ED and EC are colinear, then beta + gamma = 180°, but this is an assumption.

If I proceed with that, even though it leads to angle 1 = 1°, which seems odd, but let's see.

If angle 1 = 1°, and from angle 1 + 2*angle 2 = 179°, then angle 2 = (179 - 1)/2 = 178/2 = 89°. But this is not among the choices.

So, this suggests that either the assumption is wrong, or there's another relation.

Maybe the assumption that AD || BC is incorrect, and instead, there's another relationship.

Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the diagram is such that the two triangles ADE and BCE are part of a larger structure, and use the given equations to set up simultaneous equations.

From the given:

In triangle ADE: angle DAE + angle ADE + angle DEA = 180° → angle 2 + alpha + beta = 180°.

In triangle BCE: angle BEC + angle EBC + angle ECB = 180° → gamma + delta + angle 1 = 180°.

Also, given that angle DAE = angle 2, and angle ECB = angle 1.

Now, if we can find another relation between these variables.

Let me consider the angles at point E. Around point E, the sum of angles is 360°. The angles at E include:

- angle DEA (beta)
- angle AEB (let's call this z)
- angle BEC (gamma)
- and possibly others, depending on the number of lines through E.

But since E is connected to A, D, B, C, the lines EA, ED, EB, EC. So, the angles around E are:

Between ED and EA: angle DEA (beta)
Between EA and EB: let's call this z
Between EB and EC: angle BEC (gamma)
Between EC and ED: let's call this w

So, beta + z + gamma + w = 360°.

But without knowing z or w, this is not helpful.

However, if we consider triangle ABE, which includes angle z (angle AEB). In triangle ABE, z + x + y = 180°, where x and y are other angles at A and B.

But again, without knowing x or y, this is not helpful.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate z with other angles.

For example, if we consider line AE and BE, which are part of triangle ABE. But how?

Alternatively, if we consider that line AB is connected, and line AE and BE are connected, then angle at E (z) is part of triangle ABE.

But this still leaves us with too many unknowns.

Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should try assigning values based on the answer choices and see which one fits.

The answer choices are 23, 24, 28, 33.

Let me assume that angle 2 is one of these, and see if it fits with the equations.

Let me try angle 2 = 24 (option B). Let's see.

From earlier, if angle 2 = 24, then in triangle ADE: alpha + beta = 180 - 24 = 156.

If we assume that alpha = angle 1, and from the earlier erroneous assumption, angle 1 = 1, but that led to inconsistency. Alternatively, if there's another relation.

Wait, let's try to find another equation.

If we consider that angle ADE (alpha) and angle EBC (delta = angle 2) are equal, as in the parallel lines assumption, then alpha = angle 2.

But earlier, we had alpha = angle 1 from the parallel lines assumption. So if alpha = angle 2 and alpha = angle 1, then angle 1 = angle 2. But this would mean angle 1 = angle 2.

But in that case, from the equation angle 1 + 2*angle 2 = 179° (from earlier), if angle 1 = angle 2, then 3*angle 2 = 179 → angle 2 = 179/3 ≈ 59.67°, which is not among the choices.

So this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if there's no relation between alpha and angle 1, and we have to find another way.

Wait, let me think about the original equations again.

We have two triangles, each with their angles summing to 180°, and two equalities between angles.

But there are no other equations given, so it's underdetermined. Unless there's an implicit assumption that the diagram is such that the two triangles are part of a larger figure with additional constraints.

Wait, the problem mentions Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D), Point(E). Line(A,D), Line(D,E), Line(A,E), Line(B,C), Line(C,E), Line(B,E), Line(A,B). So these are all the lines mentioned.

Now, let me try to imagine the full diagram.

- Points A, D, E form triangle ADE.
- Points B, C, E form triangle BCE.
- Line AB connects A and B.
- So, points A, B are connected, and E is connected to both A and B.

So, points A, B, E form triangle ABE.

Now, in this setup, let's consider triangle ABE. Its angles are at A, B, E.

At point A: angle between BA and AE. Let's call this angle x.

At point B: angle between AB and BE. Call this angle y.

At point E: angle between AE and BE. Call this angle z.

So, x + y + z = 180°.

Now, angle x (at A) is part of triangle ADE. Specifically, angle DAE is part of triangle ADE, which is angle between DA and AE. If line AB is connected to A, then angle between DA and AB is some value, and angle between AB and AE is x. So, angle DAE (angle 2) is equal to the angle between DA and AE, which could be related to x if AB is aligned in a certain way.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that line AB is such that angle between DA and AB is zero, meaning that points D, A, B are collinear, but that would make angle DAE = angle between DA and AE, and AB would be along DA, making angle x = 0, which is not possible.

Alternatively, if line AB is such that it forms a straight line with DA, but again, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if we consider that angle x (at A in triangle ABE) is equal to angle DAE (angle 2). This would mean that line AB is aligned such that angle between BA and AE is the same as angle DAE. This would happen if AB is extending from A in the same direction as AD, but that would make angle DAE and angle x supplementary or something.

This is getting too ambiguous. Given that I'm running out of ideas, maybe I should consider that the problem is designed to have angle 2 = angle 1, or some other simple relationship.

Wait, let's think about the sum of the angles in the two triangles.

From triangle ADE: angle 2 + alpha + beta = 180.

From triangle BCE: angle 1 + delta + gamma = 180.

But we also have the equalities: angle 2 = delta (since MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(2)) and MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(1)).

Wait, angle(C,E,B) is angle at C, which is angle ECB, which is angle 1. So in triangle BCE, angle at C is angle 1, angle at B is delta (angle EBC), and angle at E is gamma (angle BEC).

So, in triangle BCE: gamma + delta + 1 = 180.

But we also have in triangle ADE: 2 + alpha + beta = 180.

Now, if we can relate alpha and beta to gamma and delta.

If there's a relationship between alpha and gamma, or beta and delta.

For example, if lines AD and BC are parallel, then as before, angle DAE = angle EBC (so 2 = delta), and angle ADE = angle ECB (so alpha = 1).

So, from this, we have:

From triangle ADE: 2 + alpha + beta = 180 → 2 + 1 + beta = 180 → beta = 177°.

From triangle BCE: gamma + delta + 1 = 180 → gamma + 2 + 1 = 180 → gamma = 177°.

Now, what about the angles around point E? If beta = 177° and gamma = 177°, then the sum of these two angles is 354°, leaving 6° for the other angles around E. This seems unlikely, but it's possible.

However, this doesn't give us any new information. But if we assume that the remaining angles around E are small, it might be possible.

But this still doesn't help us find angle 2. It seems like we need more constraints.

Wait, but if we assume that the sum of beta and gamma is 360° minus the other angles, but without knowing those, it's impossible.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through E, like if ED and EC are on a straight line, then beta + gamma = 180°, as before.

So, beta + gamma = 180°.

From above, beta = 177°, gamma = 177°, which would give 354°, not 180°. So this is inconsistent.

Hence, this suggests that the assumption of AD || BC is incorrect.

Given that, perhaps there's no such parallel lines, and we need to find another way.

Let me try to think outside the box. The problem provides three angles: 1, 2, 3. Only 1 and 2 are used in the equations. Maybe angle 3 is related to the other angles?

But the problem doesn't mention it in any equations, so it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the measure of angle 2 is equal to angle 1, and together with some other relations, we can solve.

But without additional info, it's hard.

Wait, let me try to think about the answer choices. The options are 23, 24, 28, 33. Let's assume that angle 2 is one of these, and see if any of them fit with the equations.

Let's assume angle 2 is 24 (option B).

From triangle ADE: 24 + alpha + beta = 180 → alpha + beta = 156.

From triangle BCE: gamma + delta + 1 = 180. But delta = angle 2 = 24, so gamma + 24 + 1 = 180 → gamma = 155.

Now, if we can relate alpha and beta to gamma.

If we assume that alpha = gamma, then alpha = 155, and beta = 156 - 155 = 1.

But this seems arbitrary, but let's see.

If alpha = 155, and beta = 1, then what?

If alpha is angle ADE, and beta is angle DEA.

If we consider the angles around E, beta + gamma + ... = 360°. If beta = 1 and gamma = 155, then the remaining angles around E would be 360 - 1 - 155 = 204°, which is possible.

But this doesn't help us find angle 2.

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between alpha and beta, like alpha = beta, but then 2*alpha = 156 → alpha = 78, and beta = 78.

But this is also arbitrary.

Without additional constraints, it's impossible to determine angle 2 from the given information. However, since this is a standardized test question, there must be a unique solution, implying that there's an implied relationship or property I'm missing.

Let me revisit the initial problem and check for any missed details.

The problem says:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A))), 180)

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B))), 180)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)))

Angle(1)

Angle(2)

Angle(3)"

So, the first two sums are the sums of the angles in each triangle, which are 180°, as expected. The next two equalities say that angle DAE (which is angle 2) and angle CEB (which is angle 1) are equal to angles 2 and 1 respectively.

Now, the problem asks for the measure of angle 2.

Wait, but what if the diagram is such that triangles ADE and BCE are part of a larger structure where angle 2 and angle 1 are complementary or supplementary to other angles?

Wait, let me think about the sum of all the angles in the diagram. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the key is that both triangles ADE and BCE have their angles summed to 180°, and the given equalities allow us to set up equations with angle 1 and angle 2.

Let me try to write down all the equations:

From triangle ADE: angle2 + alpha + beta = 180.

From triangle BCE: angle1 + delta + gamma = 180.

Also, we have:

angle2 = delta (from Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)))).

angle1 = gamma (from Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(1)))).

Wait, wait! Wait, the second equality is: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(1))). Angle(C,E,B) is the angle at C, which is angle ECB, which is angle 1. Wait, no: Angle(C,E,B) is the angle at E, between C and B? No, the notation Angle(C,E,B) is the angle at E, between C and B. Wait, no: Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(C,E,B) is the angle at E between C and B, which is angle BEC, which is gamma.

Wait, earlier I thought angle(C,E,B) is angle at C, but no, it's at E. So, Angle(C,E,B) is angle at E between C and B, which is angle BEC, which is gamma.

So, the equality is MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(1)), so gamma = angle 1.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(2)), which is angle DAE = angle 2, which is the angle at A between D and E, which is angle DAE, which is part of triangle ADE.

So, in summary:

From triangle ADE: angle2 + alpha + beta = 180.

From triangle BCE: gamma + delta + angle1 = 180.

But from the given equalities:

gamma = angle1 (since Angle(C,E,B) = angle1).

delta = angle2 (since Angle(D,A,E) = angle2).

So, substituting into the second equation:

angle1 + angle2 + angle1 = 180 → 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180.

Now, we have one equation: 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180.

But we need another equation to solve for angle2.

Where can we get another equation?

Let's look at the angles in triangle ADE: angle2 + alpha + beta = 180.

If we can relate alpha and beta to other angles.

Let me think about the angles at point E. The angles at E are:

- angle DEA (beta) from triangle ADE.
- angle BEC (gamma = angle1) from triangle BCE.
- and possibly other angles if there are more lines through E.

But since E is connected to A, D, B, C, the angles around E are:

Between ED and EA: beta (angle DEA)
Between EA and EB: let's call this z
Between EB and EC: gamma (angle BEC = angle1)
Between EC and ED: let's call this w

So, beta + z + gamma + w = 360°.

But without knowing z and w, this is not helpful.

However, if we consider that z and w are parts of other triangles or angles.

For example, z is the angle at E in triangle ABE, and w is the angle at E between EC and ED.

But without more information, it's still not helpful.

Wait, but if we consider that lines AD and BC are not parallel, and there's no other information, perhaps we need to assume that the diagram is such that the sum of beta and gamma is 180°, as in a straight line. This is a common scenario in such problems.

So, assuming beta + gamma = 180°, which would mean beta + angle1 = 180°.

From triangle ADE: angle2 + alpha + beta = 180.

But we need to relate alpha to something.

If we can find alpha in terms of other angles.

Let me consider line AD and line BC. If there's a line connecting D and C, but it's not mentioned. Or if there's a line connecting A and C, but it's not mentioned.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ADC or something.

But without knowing about such lines, this is guesswork.

Wait, but if we assume that alpha (angle ADE) is equal to angle1 (gamma), then alpha = angle1.

But why? If there's a reason like parallel lines or something.

If AD is parallel to BC, then angle ADE (alpha) would be equal to angle BCE (angle1), as alternate interior angles. So, alpha = angle1.

So, if we assume that, then:

From triangle ADE: angle2 + angle1 + beta = 180.

But from the earlier assumption, beta + gamma = 180°, and gamma = angle1. So beta + angle1 = 180° → beta = 180° - angle1.

Substitute into the equation from triangle ADE:

angle2 + angle1 + (180° - angle1) = 180° → angle2 + 180° = 180° → angle2 = 0°, which is impossible.

So this is invalid.

Alternatively, if alpha is equal to beta, then from triangle ADE: angle2 + alpha + beta = 180 → angle2 + 2*alpha = 180.

But without knowing alpha, this is not helpful.

This is really challenging. Given that I've spent a lot of time and not reached a conclusion, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me revisit the equation 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180° from earlier. If I can find another equation relating angle1 and angle2, I can solve for angle2.

Let me think about the angles at point A and point B.

At point A, we have angle DAE (angle2) and possibly other angles if there are other lines. For example, if line AB is connected, then at point A, there are lines AD, AE, and AB. The angles at A would include angle DAE (between DA and AE), and the angle between AB and AD, and the angle between AB and AE.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that line AB is such that it creates a straight line with AD, making angle DAB = 180°, which would mean that points D, A, B are collinear, but this would make angle DAE = angle between DA and AE, and angle between AB and AE would be zero, which is not possible.

Alternatively, if line AB is such that it creates a triangle with other elements.

Alternatively, if we consider that the sum of angles at A and B is related to other angles.

But this is too vague.

Wait, let me try to think of the problem in terms of the given answer choices. Let's say angle2 is 24 (option B). Then from 2*angle1 + 24 = 180 → 2*angle1 = 156 → angle1 = 78.

Now, if angle1 = 78 and angle2 = 24, what could this represent?

If angle1 is 78°, and angle2 is 24°, maybe they are parts of some triangle or supplementary angles.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where these angles are part of.

But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if angle1 and angle2 are part of a triangle with another angle, say angle3, such that angle1 + angle2 + angle3 = 180°, but this is pure speculation.

If angle1 = 78 and angle2 = 24, then angle3 = 180 - 78 - 24 = 78°. But this is just guessing.

However, since the answer choices are fixed, and the problem likely has a unique solution, maybe there's a standard configuration.

Another idea: since both triangles ADE and BCE have their angles summing to 180°, and angle2 and angle1 are parts of these, perhaps the diagram is such that the two triangles are part of a larger triangle or quadrilateral.

For example, if points A, B, C, D, E form a pentagon, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if the diagram is such that lines AD and BC intersect at E, making E the intersection point of AD and BC. In this case, E is the intersection of AD and BC, and the triangles ADE and BCE are formed.

In this case, angle DAE and angle EBC would be vertical angles or something.

Wait, if AD and BC intersect at E, then E is the intersection point. So, lines AD and BC intersect at E, forming vertically opposite angles.

In this case, angle DAE and angle EBC would be vertically opposite angles if lines AD and BC intersect at E. Wait, no, vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect. If AD and BC intersect at E, then the vertically opposite angles would be angle AEB and angle DEC, or something like that.

But angle DAE is at A, not at E. So this might not help.

But if AD and BC intersect at E, then at point E, we have angles formed by the intersection of AD and BC. So, angle AEB and angle DEC are vertically opposite.

But angle DAE is at A, and angle EBC is at B. These might not be directly related.

But if AD and BC intersect at E, then in triangle ADE and triangle BCE, we can use properties of intersecting lines.

For example, the sum of angles at E would be 180°, but this is already accounted for in the triangles.

This is getting too abstract. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the equation 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180°.

Assume that angle1 is equal to angle2, then 3*angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 60°, which is not an option.

If angle1 is twice angle2, then 2*(2*angle2) + angle2 = 180 → 5*angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 36°, not an option.

If angle1 is 30°, then 2*30 + angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 120°, not an option.

If angle1 is 45°, then 2*45 + angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 90°, not an option.

If angle1 is 72°, then 2*72 + angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 36°, not an option.

If angle1 is 60°, angle2 = 60°, no.

Wait, but if angle1 = 180 - 2*angle2, from the equation 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180 → angle1 = (180 - angle2)/2.

Now, if there's another relationship between angle1 and angle2, like angle1 = angle2, then (180 - angle2)/2 = angle2 → 180 - angle2 = 2*angle2 → 3*angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 60°, again not an option.

If angle1 = 2*angle2, then 2*(2*angle2) + angle2 = 180 → 5*angle2 = 180 → angle2 = 36°, not an option.

If angle1 = 3*angle2, then 2*(3*angle2) + angle2 = 180 → 7*angle2 = 180 → angle2 ≈ 25.71°, close to 24 or 23.

Option B is 24, which is close to 25.71. Option A is 23, which is closer to 25.71 than 24 is? No, 25.71 is closer to 26, which is not an option. The closest is 24 (option B) or 23 (option A).

But since this is a constructed problem, maybe the intended answer is 24, and the approximation is due to rounding.

But why would angle1 = 3*angle2?

This is purely speculative, but given the options, and assuming that the equation 2*angle1 + angle2 = 180° is the only equation, and if angle1 is 3*angle2, then angle2 = 24°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if angle1 = 2*angle2, then angle2 = 36°, not an option.

Alternatively, if angle1 = angle2 + 30, then 2*(angle2 + 30) + angle2 = 180 → 3*angle2 + 60 = 180 → angle2 = 40°, not an option.

Alternatively, if angle1 = angle2 + 12, then 2*(angle2 +
