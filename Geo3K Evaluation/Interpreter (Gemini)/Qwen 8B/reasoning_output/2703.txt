QUESTION:
Find x.

CHOICES:
A. 10.5
B. 12
C. 12.5
D. 14

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have triangle ABC with points A, B, C. There's also point D connected to A, B, C, and D lies on line BC. Also, AD bisects angle BAC. The lengths of AB is 14, AC is 10, BC is 18. We need to find BD (which is labeled as x) and DC which is 18 - x. And there's a ratio condition that the ratio of AC/AB equals CD/BD. 

First, since AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC, maybe I can use the Angle Bisector Theorem here. The theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Wait, but in this case, AD is the angle bisector of angle A, so it should divide BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. But wait, hold onâ€”point D is on BC? Let me check the constraints again.

Yes, Point D lies on Line(B,C). So according to the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC. Wait, but AB is 14 and AC is 10. Therefore BD/DC = 14/10 = 7/5. But BD + DC = BC = 18. Let me write that down:

Let BD = x, then DC = 18 - x. According to the ratio, BD/DC = 7/5. So x/(18 - x) = 7/5. Solving for x:

Cross-multiplying: 5x = 7*(18 - x)

5x = 126 - 7x

5x + 7x = 126

12x = 126

x = 126 / 12 = 10.5

Wait, but 10.5 isn't among the answer choices? Wait, looking back at the answer choices: A is 10.5, B is 12, etc. So option A would be 10.5. However, let me check again because sometimes I might mix up the ratio.

Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem says BD/DC = AB/AC. AB is 14, AC is 10. So BD/DC = 14/10 = 7/5. Then BD = (7/5)*DC. Since BD + DC = BC = 18, substituting:

(7/5)DC + DC = 18 => (12/5)DC = 18 => DC = 18 * (5/12) = 15/2 = 7.5. Then BD = 18 - 7.5 = 10.5. Which matches my previous calculation. So x is 10.5, which is option A.

But wait, the answer choices include A as 10.5. But why is there a mention of RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B))) equals RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D)),LengthOf(Line(B,D))). That seems redundant if we already applied the Angle Bisector Theorem. Maybe that's just reinforcing the same condition. So the answer should be 10.5, which is option A. 

But let me double-check everything once more. The problem mentions that AD bisects angle BAC, so yes, the Angle Bisector Theorem applies. The ratio of AB to AC is 14:10, simplifies to 7:5, hence BD:DC = 7:5. Total BC is 18, so BD = 7 parts, DC = 5 parts. Each part is 18/(7+5)= 18/12=1.5. Therefore BD = 7*1.5=10.5. Yep, that's consistent. So x is 10.5, which is answer A. 

Hmm, but the answer choices include A as 10.5. So the correct answer is A. But wait, sometimes problems may have different configurations, like maybe D is not between B and C? But the constraint says PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(B,C)), so D is on BC. Therefore, the standard Angle Bisector Theorem applies. Hence, answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(B,D)) $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

We are told the following:

- Triangle $ ABC $ has vertices $ A, B, C $.
- Point $ D $ lies on segment $ BC $, i.e., $ D \in \overline{BC} $.
- Segment $ AD $ **bisects** angle $ \angle BAC $.
- Given lengths:
  - $ AB = 14 $
  - $ AC = 10 $
  - $ BC = 18 $

Thus, $ D $ lies somewhere along $ \overline{BC} $, and we're to find the length $ BD = x $. It follows that $ CD = 18 - x $.

---

### **Step 2: Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem**

Since $ AD $ is the angle bisector of $ \angle BAC $, the **Angle Bisector Theorem** tells us:

$$
\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
\frac{x}{18 - x} = \frac{14}{10} = \frac{7}{5}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve the Proportion**

We solve the equation:

$$
\frac{x}{18 - x} = \frac{7}{5}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
5x = 7(18 - x)
$$
$$
5x = 126 - 7x
$$
$$
12x = 126
$$
$$
x = \frac{126}{12} = 10.5
$$

So, the length of $ BD = x = 10.5 $.

---

### **Step 4: Confirming Consistency with Ratios**

The final condition in the problem also states:

$$
\frac{\text{LengthOf}(AC)}{\text{LengthOf}(AB)} = \frac{\text{LengthOf}(CD)}{\text{LengthOf}(BD)}
$$

Which confirms the same proportionality used above. This ensures our application of the Angle Bisector Theorem was valid.

---

### **Conclusion**

From the Angle Bisector Theorem and solving the resulting proportion, we find:

$$
x = 10.5
$$

This corresponds directly to **Answer Choice A**.
