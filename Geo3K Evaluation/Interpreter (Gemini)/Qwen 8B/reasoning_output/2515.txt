MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two congruent triangles, triangle RST and triangle ABC. The problem gives us several constraints, and we need to find the value of x. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can see how they connect.

First, the triangles are congruent: Triangle(R,S,T) ≅ Triangle(A,B,C). That means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. Also, there are some equations involving lengths and angles. 

Let me note down the key equations:

1. Length of line ST equals 2y minus 8: Length(ST) = 2y - 8.
2. Length of line BC equals y plus 13: Length(BC) = y + 13.
3. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides should be equal. Therefore, Length(ST) must equal Length(BC). So, setting those equal: 2y - 8 = y + 13. Solving that would give us the value of y. Wait, but maybe I need to check if that's correct? Because the problem also says that Length(ST) equals Length(BC), so yes, that equation makes sense.

So solving 2y - 8 = y + 13. Subtract y from both sides: y - 8 = 13. Then add 8 to both sides: y = 21. Hmm, okay. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's more to it? Or perhaps there's another part?

But before that, let's look at the angles. The measure of angle S equals 5x + 20 degrees, and the measure of angle B equals 3x + 40 degrees. Also, since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. So angle S corresponds to angle B because the triangles are congruent (assuming the order of the letters matters for correspondence). Wait, the congruence is Triangle(R,S,T) ≅ Triangle(A,B,C). So that would mean vertex R corresponds to A, S to B, and T to C. So angle S corresponds to angle B. Therefore, their measures should be equal. Hence, Measure(angle S) = Measure(angle B).

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5x + 20 = 3x + 40. Solving that would give us the value of x. Let me do that. Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x + 20 = 40. Subtract 20: 2x = 20. Divide by 2: x = 10. So that suggests x is 10. But wait, let me make sure that's right. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else here. Let me double-check. If the triangles are congruent, then all corresponding parts are equal. So angle S corresponds to angle B, as per the order of the vertices. Therefore, their measures must be equal. So the equation is correct. So solving that gives x=10. Which is option B. But let me check if there's another way this could be approached, or if I missed anything.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the side lengths first. From earlier, solving 2y -8 = y +13 gives y=21. Then, substituting back into the length expressions, Length(ST)=2*21-8=42-8=34, and Length(BC)=21+13=34. So that checks out. So that part seems consistent.

Now, regarding the angles. If x=10, then Measure(angle S)=5*10 +20=70 degrees. Measure(angle B)=3*10 +40=70 degrees. So that works. So that seems correct. Therefore, x=10, which is option B. 

But wait, the problem didn't mention anything about the sum of angles or other relations. Are there any other constraints? For example, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. Maybe we need to check that? Let me think. However, since the triangles are congruent, each triangle has angles adding up to 180. But since we already have two angles equal, maybe we can check if that holds?

For instance, take triangle RST. We know angle S is 70 degrees. What about the other angles? Well, since the triangles are congruent, triangle ABC has angle B equal to 70 degrees. But without knowing the third angle, maybe we don't need to go further. Unless there's more info. However, the problem only asks for x, and according to our calculation, x=10. So unless there's an error in assuming the correspondence of angles.

Wait, let me confirm again the correspondence. The congruence is Triangle(R,S,T) ≅ Triangle(A,B,C). In congruence notation, the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So R corresponds to A, S corresponds to B, T corresponds to C. Therefore, angle S corresponds to angle B. Hence, their measures are equal. Therefore, the equation is correct. So the calculation for x is valid.

Another thing to check: Could there be another pair of angles that might relate? For example, maybe angle R corresponds to angle A, angle T to angle C. But the problem mentions angles S and B, so that's covered. 

Is there a possibility that the problem involves using the Law of Cosines or something else? For example, if we had more information about sides and angles. But since we have two different equations for angles leading to x=10, and the sides leading to y=21, which is consistent. So maybe that's sufficient. 

Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to use both the side lengths and angles? Let me think. Suppose that even though the triangles are congruent, there might be multiple ways to approach. But no, since congruence implies all corresponding parts are equal, so the equations for angles and sides are independent. So solving them separately is okay. 

Thus, my conclusion is x=10, which is option B. Therefore, the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints involving the congruence of two triangles and the relationships between their corresponding sides and angles.

### Step 1: Use Congruence to Relate Corresponding Parts

We are told that:
$$
\triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC
$$
This means **all corresponding sides and angles are equal**. Specifically:
- Side $ RT $ corresponds to $ AC $
- Side $ RS $ corresponds to $ AB $
- Side $ ST $ corresponds to $ BC $
- Angle $ \angle S $ corresponds to $ \angle B $
- Angle $ \angle T $ corresponds to $ \angle C $
- Angle $ \angle R $ corresponds to $ \angle A $

From this, we conclude that:
$$
\text{Measure}(\angle S) = \text{Measure}(\angle B)
$$

---

### Step 2: Set Up Equation for Angles

The problem provides expressions for these angles:
$$
\text{Measure}(\angle S) = 5x + 20 \\
\text{Measure}(\angle B) = 3x + 40
$$

Since the angles are equal due to triangle congruence:
$$
5x + 20 = 3x + 40
$$

Subtract $ 3x $ from both sides:
$$
2x + 20 = 40
$$

Subtract 20 from both sides:
$$
2x = 20
$$

Divide by 2:
$$
x = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify Consistency with Other Constraints

We also check whether the side-lengths are consistent. The problem states:
$$
\text{Length}(ST) = 2y - 8 \\
\text{Length}(BC) = y + 13
$$

Since $ \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC $, then $ \text{Length}(ST) = \text{Length}(BC) $. Setting the expressions equal:
$$
2y - 8 = y + 13
$$

Subtract $ y $ from both sides:
$$
y - 8 = 13
$$

Add 8 to both sides:
$$
y = 21
$$

Plugging back into either expression confirms consistency:
$$
\text{Length}(ST) = 2(21) - 8 = 34 \\
\text{Length}(BC) = 21 + 13 = 34
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

All derived values are consistent with the given constraints. The value of $ x $ that satisfies the equality of the corresponding angles is:

$$
\boxed{x = 10}
$$
