MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a quadrilateral Q, R, S, T. The angles at each point Q, R, S, T are given in terms of x. The measure of angle Q is 2x + 5, angle R is x, angle S is 2x + 7 (wait, wait, the original says MeasureOf(Angle(S), Mul(Add(2,0),x,7))... Hmm, maybe that's 2x + 7? Or maybe it's Add(2,0) which would be 2, then multiplied by x? Wait, the notation might be confusing. Let me parse that again.

The user wrote:

MeasureOf(Angle(Q),Mul(Add(2,0),x,5))

Wait, perhaps there's some formatting issue here. Maybe it's supposed to be Multiply(Add(2,0), x, 5)? But that still isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 times x plus 5? Like 2x + 5? Similarly for Angle(S): MeasureOf(Angle(S), Mul(Add(2,0),x,7))—maybe that's 2x + 7?

Assuming that, since Add(2,0) would be 2, so Multiply(2, x, 5) could mean 2*x + 5? Or maybe 2*(x+5)? Wait, but the way it's written is unclear. However, given that in standard algebraic expressions, if you have something like 2x + 5, that's straightforward. Also, looking at the answer choices, which include numbers like 60, 58, etc., so likely the equations will resolve to x being a certain value.

Let me proceed with the assumption that:

- Measure of Angle Q is 2x + 5
- Measure of Angle R is x
- Measure of Angle S is 2x + 7
- Measure of Angle T is x

Then the sum of these four angles equals 360 degrees because they form a quadrilateral.

So adding them up:

(2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) + x = 360

Combine like terms:

First, expand the terms:

2x + 5 + x + 2x + 7 + x

Now combine the x terms:

2x + x + 2x + x = 6x

Constant terms: 5 + 7 = 12

So total equation: 6x + 12 = 360

Subtract 12 from both sides: 6x = 348

Divide both sides by 6: x = 348 / 6

Calculating that: 348 divided by 6. Let me do that division.

6*50=300, so 348-300=48. Then 48/6=8. So total x=58.

Therefore, x is 58. But the question asks for m∠R, which is x. So the measure of angle R is 58 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 58. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me check my assumptions again. Because the original problem had MeasureOf(Angle(Q),Mul(Add(2,0),x,5)). If that was meant to be 2x + 5, then yes. But if the structure is different, like maybe 2*(x + 5)? That would be 2x + 10. Wait, that would change things. Let me re-examine the original problem's wording.

Original says:

MeasureOf(Angle(Q),Mul(Add(2,0),x,5))

Assuming that "Add(2,0)" is 2 + 0 = 2, then "Mul(Add(2,0),x,5)" – but how does that work? If it's multiplying three terms: 2 * x * 5? Which would be 10x. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's Add(Mul(2,0),x,5)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or formatting error. For example, if the original intended to write 2x + 5, maybe the code was trying to represent that as Add(Mul(2,x),5). But the way it's written here is ambiguous. But given that the answer comes out nicely when assuming 2x + 5, and the answer choice includes 58, which matches x=58, I think that's the right approach.

Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(Q)) is 2x + 5, MeasureOf(Angle(S)) is 2x + 7, and others as before. Therefore, solving gives x=58. Hence, answer A.

But let me check again. Suppose instead that the measure of angle Q is 2x + 5, angle R is x, angle S is 2x + 7, angle T is x. Sum is 6x + 12 = 360 → x=58. Correct.

Thus, m∠R is x=58. So answer A. But let me check if there's another interpretation. Suppose that the measure of angle Q is 2*(x + 5) = 2x + 10, and angle S is 2*(x + 7)=2x +14. Then the sum would be:

(2x +10) + x + (2x +14) +x = 6x +24 = 360 → 6x=336 → x=56. Then m∠R is 56, which is not among the options. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Maybe "Mul(Add(2,0),x,5)" means Add(Mul(2,0),x,5). But Mul(2,0) is 0, so Add(0, x, 5) is x +5. Then angle Q is x +5. Similarly, angle S is Mul(Add(2,0),x,7) → same logic, Add(2,0)=2, so Mul(2, x, 7) would be 2x*7=14x? Or Add(2,0) is 2, then multiply by x and 7? Not sure.

This is getting too ambiguous. Given that the initial calculation gives x=58 which is an option, and the alternative interpretations don't fit, I think the first assumption is correct. Thus, answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle R $ in the given quadrilateral $ Q, R, S, T $, we begin by analyzing the relationships between the angles based on the information provided.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Angles**

We're told the measures of the angles in terms of $ x $:

- $ \angle Q = 2x + 5 $
- $ \angle R = x $
- $ \angle S = 2x + 7 $
- $ \angle T = x $

These expressions suggest linear combinations involving $ x $. Based on typical geometric conventions and the presence of similar structures (e.g., $ 2x + 5 $, $ 2x + 7 $), we interpret the angle measures accordingly.

---

### **Step 2: Use of Quadrilateral Angle Sum Property**

In any quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles is always:

$$
\text{Sum} = 360^\circ
$$

Using the given expressions:

$$
(2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) + x = 360
$$

---

### **Step 3: Simplify the Equation**

Grouping like terms:

- Combine $ x $ terms: $ 2x + x + 2x + x = 6x $
- Constant terms: $ 5 + 7 = 12 $

So,

$$
6x + 12 = 360
$$

---

### **Step 4: Solve for $ x $**

$$
6x = 360 - 12 = 348 \\
x = \frac{348}{6} = 58
$$

---

### **Step 5: Determine $ m\angle R $**

Since $ \angle R = x $, its measure is:

$$
m\angle R = 58^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

From the above steps, the only valid interpretation consistent with the given data leads us to conclude that $ m\angle R = 58^\circ $, which corresponds directly to **Option A**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: A}}
$$
