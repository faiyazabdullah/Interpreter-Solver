====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 3. Hmm, first I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned. There are points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, AC, BD. Also, point D lies on line AC. So that means D is somewhere along the line connecting A and C. 

Then there are several triangles mentioned: triangle ABC, triangle ABD, triangle BCD. Wait, but since D is on line AC, triangle ABD would have vertices A, B, D. And triangle BCD would be B, C, D. But since D is on AC, maybe some angles can be related through straight lines or something else?

Now looking at the angles given. The measures for angles at point B, A, C, etc. Specifically:

- Measure of angle (BAC) is 40 degrees. That's angle at A between BA and CA.
- Measure of angle (ACB) is 70 degrees. That's angle at C between AC and CB.
- Then there's angle (ABD) which is 45 degrees. So angle at B between AB and BD.
- Then there are equations involving sums of angles equaling 180 degrees. For example, sum of angles BAC, ACB, and ABC equals 180. Since we know two of those angles already, maybe we can find the third? Wait, angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. Let me check that.

In triangle ABC, the angles are at A (BAC = 40°), at B (ABC), and at C (ACB = 70°). Their sum should be 180°. Therefore:

40 + angle ABC + 70 = 180 → angle ABC = 180 - 40 -70 = 70 degrees. Wait, so angle ABC is 70 degrees? But then, there's another equation involving angles ABD, BAC, and ADB. Let me see.

The next equation says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B))) equals 180. So that's angle ABD (which is given as 45°), angle BAC (40°), and angle ADB. So adding them up gives 45 + 40 + angle ADB = 180. Therefore, angle ADB = 180 - 45 -40 = 95 degrees. Wait, angle ADB is angle at D between AD and BD. But since D is on AC, AD is part of AC. So perhaps triangle ABD has angles at A, B, D. We know angle at B is 45°, angle at A is 40°, so angle at D (ADB) is 95°, as above.

But how does that help us find angle 3, which is defined as angle ADB? Wait, no. Let me check again. The question defines three angles:

Angle(1) = angle BDC (since it's equal to angle BDC?), wait no:

Wait, the problem states:

Angle(1) = angle(B,D,C) — which is angle at D between B and C. Wait, angle BDC? Or angle at D between B and C? Let me clarify notation. In standard terms, angle(B,D,C) is the angle at D between points B and C. So that's angle BDC. Similarly, angle(2) is angle(C,B,D) which is angle at B between C and D. Wait, no: angle(C,B,D) is the angle at B between C and D. Wait, the notation is angle(X,Y,Z) meaning angle at Y between X and Z. So angle(C,B,D) is angle at B between C and D. Which is angle CBD. Similarly, angle(3) is angle(A,D,B), which is angle at D between A and B. Which is angle ADB, which we just found to be 95 degrees. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, angle ADB is 95 degrees. However, the problem says Equals(Add(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))), 180). So angle 1 plus angle 3 equals 180. So angle 1 is angle BDC (from earlier), and angle 3 is angle ADB. Wait, but angle ADB was found to be 95 degrees. If angle 1 + angle 3 = 180, then angle 1 = 180 - angle 3. But angle 3 is angle ADB, which is 95, so angle 1 would be 85 degrees. Wait, but maybe angle 1 isn't angle BDC directly? Let me recheck.

Let me go back to the problem statement. It says:

Angle(1) = angle(B,D,C) — which is angle at D between B and C, i.e., angle BDC.

Angle(2) = angle(C,B,D) — angle at B between C and D, i.e., angle CBD.

Angle(3) = angle(A,D,B) — angle at D between A and B, i.e., angle ADB.

So the last equation is Add(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))) = 180. So angle BDC + angle ADB = 180 degrees. But angle BDC is part of triangle BDC, and angle ADB is part of triangle ABD.

But since D lies on AC, then AD + DC = AC. So when considering angles at D, angle ADC is a straight line? Wait, no. Because D is on AC, so if you look at point D on line AC, then the line BD connects to D. So angle at D between A and B is angle ADB, and angle at D between B and C is angle BDC. Now, since D is on AC, the sum of angles ADB and BDC would form a linear pair? Wait, because if you imagine point D on AC, then BD splits into two angles at D: ADB and BDC. Wait, but they are adjacent angles forming a straight line? No, because BD is a separate line. Wait, maybe not. Wait, D is on AC, so the line AC passes through D. So, if you consider the line AC passing through D, then the angles around D on line AC would be... Well, BD is connected to D. So at point D, we have two lines: DA and DC (since D is on AC), and also DB. So the angles at D would be between DA and DB (angle ADB), and between DB and DC (angle BDC). These two angles are adjacent and together form the angle between DA and DC, which is a straight line (since D is on AC). Therefore, angle ADB + angle BDC = 180 degrees. Hence, angle 3 (ADB) + angle 1 (BDC) = 180 degrees. Therefore, the given condition that their sum is 180 is consistent with that. So that equation holds regardless of specific values. But we need more info to find angle 3 (ADB).

Earlier, we found angle ADB (angle 3) to be 95 degrees. But let me verify that again. From the second equation:

SumOf(angle ABD, angle BAC, angle ADB) = 180. Given angle ABD is 45 degrees, angle BAC is 40 degrees. So 45 + 40 + angle ADB = 180. Thus angle ADB = 95 degrees. So angle 3 is 95 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, option C is 95. So why is there a need for further steps?

Wait, but hold on. Maybe there's more to it. Let me check other parts. Also, there's another equation involving angle(C,B,D) and others. Let me check the third equation:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C))), 180). So angle(C,B,D) is angle CBD, angle(A,C,B) is angle ACB which is 70 degrees, and angle(B,D,C) is angle BDC. So adding these three angles gives 180 degrees. Therefore:

angle CBD + 70 + angle BDC = 180. Therefore, angle CBD + angle BDC = 110 degrees. But from before, angle CBD is angle 2, and angle BDC is angle 1. So angle 2 + angle 1 = 110 degrees. But we also had angle 1 + angle 3 = 180 degrees. So angle 1 = 180 - angle 3. Substituting into angle 2 + angle 1 = 110:

angle 2 + (180 - angle 3) = 110 → angle 2 - angle 3 = -70 → angle 2 = angle 3 -70.

But how do we find angle 2? Let's think about triangle CBD. Wait, triangle BCD? Wait, triangle BCD is mentioned. Let me check its angles. In triangle BCD, the angles are at B (angle CBD), at C (angle BCD), and at D (angle BDC). Wait, angle BCD is part of triangle ABC. Wait, original triangle ABC has angle at C being 70 degrees. But since D is on AC, angle BCD is the same as angle ACB? Wait, no. Because D is on AC, so angle BCD is still part of triangle BCD. Let me think. Original angle at C in triangle ABC is angle ACB = 70 degrees. But since D is on AC, then angle BCD is the same as angle ACB? Not necessarily. Wait, angle ACB is the angle between AC and CB. If D is on AC, then angle BCD is the same as angle ACB, right? Because CD is a segment of AC. So angle at C between BC and CD is the same as angle ACB. Therefore, angle BCD = 70 degrees. Therefore, in triangle BCD, angles are angle CBD (angle 2), angle BCD (70 degrees), and angle BDC (angle 1). So sum of angles in triangle BCD is angle 2 + 70 + angle 1 = 180. Which matches the equation given earlier. So angle 2 + angle 1 = 110 degrees.

But we also had angle 1 + angle 3 = 180. And angle 3 is angle ADB, which we previously found as 95 degrees. So angle 1 = 180 - 95 = 85 degrees. Then angle 2 = 110 - angle 1 = 110 - 85 = 25 degrees. But how does that relate to anything else?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to calculate angle 3. Wait, but earlier we thought angle 3 is 95 degrees based on triangle ABD. Let me confirm that again. Triangle ABD has angles at A, B, D. At A: angle BAD. Wait, angle BAC is 40 degrees, and since D is on AC, angle BAD is the same as angle BAC? Wait, no. Wait, angle BAC is angle at A between BA and CA. Since D is on AC, then angle BAD is the same as angle BAC, right? Because D is on AC, so BA to DA is the same direction as BA to CA. Wait, no. If D is between A and C, then angle BAD is part of angle BAC. Wait, suppose D is between A and C. Then, from point A, the line AB goes to B, and line AD goes to D (which is along AC). Therefore, angle BAD is the angle between BA and DA. But since DA is part of AC, angle BAD is the same as angle BAC? No, unless D coincides with C. Wait, no. If D is between A and C, then angle BAD is the same as angle BAC only if D is at C. Otherwise, if D is between A and C, then angle BAD is smaller than angle BAC. Wait, but the problem didn't specify where D is located on AC. So maybe my earlier assumption that angle BAD is 40 degrees is incorrect.

Oh! Here's a mistake I made earlier. When I considered triangle ABD, I assumed that angle at A is 40 degrees, but that might not be true. Because angle BAC is 40 degrees, but if D is on AC, then angle BAD depends on where D is. So angle BAD is part of angle BAC. Therefore, angle BAD could be less than 40 degrees. Therefore, my previous calculation of angle ADB as 95 degrees may be wrong. Oh wow, that changes things. So I need to approach this differently.

Let me start over. First, let's consider triangle ABC. Angles at A: 40 degrees, at C: 70 degrees, so angle at B (angle ABC) is 70 degrees as calculated before. Now, point D lies on AC. So AC is divided into segments AD and DC. Let me denote AD = x, DC = y, but maybe coordinates can help here. Alternatively, use variables for angles.

In triangle ABD, we have angles at A, B, D. Let me call angle at A as α, angle at B as β, and angle at D as γ. So α + β + γ = 180. Similarly, in triangle CBD, angles at C, B, D. Let me think.

Given that angle ABD is 45 degrees. Wait, angle ABD is the angle at B between A and D. So in triangle ABD, angle at B is 45 degrees. So β = 45 degrees. Then, angle at A (α) is angle BAD, which is part of angle BAC (40 degrees). So α = angle BAD = ?

Similarly, angle at D (γ) is angle ADB, which is angle 3. So in triangle ABD, angles are α (BAD), 45 degrees (ABD), and γ (ADB). So α + 45 + γ = 180 → α + γ = 135 degrees.

Also, since D lies on AC, the entire angle at A (BAC) is 40 degrees, which is split into angle BAD (α) and angle DAC. Wait, if D is between A and C, then from point A, going to D and then to C. So angle BAC is composed of angle BAD and angle DAC? Wait, no. Wait, angle BAC is the angle between BA and CA. Since D is on AC, then from point A, the line AD is part of AC. Therefore, angle BAD is the same as angle BAC only if D is at C. But if D is between A and C, then angle BAD is the same as angle BAC. Wait, no. Wait, if you're standing at point A, looking towards B, and then looking towards D (which is on AC), then angle BAD is the angle between BA and DA. Since DA is along AC, that's the same as angle between BA and CA, which is angle BAC. Therefore, angle BAD = angle BAC = 40 degrees? Wait, that seems conflicting with earlier thoughts. Wait, no. If D is on AC, then DA is a segment of AC, so from point A, the direction towards D is along AC. Therefore, angle between BA and DA is the same as angle between BA and CA. Therefore, angle BAD is equal to angle BAC, which is 40 degrees. Therefore, α = 40 degrees. Therefore, in triangle ABD, angles are 40°, 45°, and γ. So 40 + 45 + γ = 180 → γ = 95 degrees. Therefore, angle ADB (which is angle 3) is 95 degrees. So that brings us back to the initial conclusion. But then why did I doubt earlier? Because I confused angle BAD with something else. So if angle BAD is indeed 40 degrees, then angle ADB is 95 degrees. But then, according to the equation angle 1 + angle 3 = 180, angle 1 is angle BDC, which would be 85 degrees. Then, in triangle BCD, angles are angle CBD (let's call it θ), angle BCD (which is angle ACB = 70 degrees), and angle BDC (85 degrees). So θ + 70 + 85 = 180 → θ = 25 degrees. So angle CBD is 25 degrees. 

But how does that connect with other angles? Let me check if there are other relations. Also, angle ABC is 70 degrees. In triangle ABC, angle ABC is at point B, between points A and C. But angle ABC is also composed of angle ABD (45 degrees) and angle CBD (θ=25 degrees). Indeed, 45 + 25 = 70, which matches the earlier calculation. Perfect! So that checks out.

Therefore, angle 3 is 95 degrees, which corresponds to option C. So the answer should be C. But let me make sure there are no contradictions elsewhere. 

Another thing to check: the third equation involving angle(C,B,D) (which is angle CBD = 25 degrees), angle(A,C,B) (which is angle ACB = 70 degrees), and angle(B,D,C) (angle BDC = 85 degrees). Adding them: 25 + 70 + 85 = 180, which works. 

And the equation for angle 1 + angle 3 = 85 + 95 = 180, which is correct. 

Thus, everything checks out. Therefore, angle 3 is 95 degrees. So the answer is C.
