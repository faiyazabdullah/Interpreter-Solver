Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a parallelogram ABCD, which means opposite sides are equal and parallel. The points A, B, C, D form a parallelogram, so AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Also, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F. 

The question asks for the measure of angle CDF. Let me note down all the given information first. 

Given that AD has length 29, and CD is 25. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if AD is one side, then BC should also be 29? But wait, they mention that CD is 25. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. 

Wait, the problem says:

- Length of AD is 29 (so AD = 29)
- Length of CD is 25 (CD = 25)

But since it's a parallelogram, AB equals CD, and AD equals BC. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and AD equals BC. Therefore, AB = CD = 25? Wait, but AD is given as 29, so BC would also be 29. But CD is 25, so AB is 25. That seems okay. 

Also, there are some expressions involving variables x and y. For example:

Length of BC is 3y - 4, and length of AB is 5x. Since AB equals CD, which is 25, so 5x = 25 → x = 5. Similarly, BC is equal to AD, which is 29. So 3y - 4 = 29 → 3y = 33 → y = 11. So that gives us values for x and y. Maybe these will come into play later.

Now, angles. There are several angles mentioned:

Angle at AFD is 49 degrees. Angle at DFC is 54 degrees. And angle at DAF is 49 degrees? Wait, let me parse the given angle measures:

Measure of angle AFD is 34 degrees. Wait, original problem states:

- Measure of angle AFD is 34°
- Measure of angle DFC is 54°
- Measure of angle DAF is 49°

Wait, let me recheck:

Original problem says:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), 34) → angle AFD is 34°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)), 54) → angle DFC is 54°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), 49) → angle DAF is 49°

So angle DAF is 49°, angle AFD is 34°, and angle DFC is 54°. We need to find angle CDF.

Let me sketch the diagram mentally. ABCD is a parallelogram, so AD is parallel to BC, AB is parallel to DC. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. So point F is the intersection of diagonals. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD.

Wait, but here, the lines AC and BD intersect at F. So F is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, AF = FC and BF = FD. 

Now, looking at triangle AFD. In triangle AFD, we know angle at A is 49°, angle at F is 34°, so maybe we can find the third angle?

Wait, angle DAF is 49°, angle AFD is 34°, so angle at D in triangle AFD would be 180 - 49 - 34 = 97 degrees. Wait, but angle at D here would be angle ADF. Wait, angle at D in triangle AFD is angle ADF. So angle ADF is 97°. 

But angle ADF is part of angle ADC of the parallelogram. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ADC + angle DAB = 180°. But angle DAB is angle at A, which includes angle DAF (which is 49°). Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Alternatively, since F is the intersection of diagonals, maybe considering triangles formed by the diagonals.

But let's see. Let me focus on triangle DFC. We know angle DFC is 54°, and we might need to find angle CDF. If we can find another angle in triangle DFC, then we can compute angle CDF.

To do that, maybe we need to find some relations between angles. Let's think about triangle DFC. The angles in triangle DFC are at D (CDF?), at F (DFC=54°), and at C (FCD). 

If we can find angle at C (FCD), then angle CDF = 180 - 54 - angle FCD. Alternatively, maybe using other relationships.

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, then AD || BC, so angles related to those lines may have certain properties. Also, since diagonals bisect each other, maybe triangle AFD and triangle CFB are congruent or something like that.

Wait, but maybe considering triangle AFD and triangle CFB. Since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD, and angles... Well, maybe not directly helpful yet.

Alternatively, look at triangle DFC. Let me think. What's the relationship between angles around point F?

We know angle AFD is 34°, and angle DFC is 54°. Are these adjacent angles? Because F is the intersection of diagonals. Let me visualize:

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. Then, angle AFD is formed by segments AF and DF. Then, angle DFC is adjacent to angle AFD, forming a straight line along diagonal BD? Wait, no. Because BD is split into BF and FD. So angle AFD and angle DFC are vertical angles? Or adjacent?

Wait, when two lines cross, vertical angles are equal. Here, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. So angle AFD and angle BFC are vertical angles. Similarly, angle AFC and angle DFB are vertical angles. However, the given angles are angle AFD (34°) and angle DFC (54°). Wait, angle DFC is at point F, between DF and FC. Let me clarify:

At point F, there are four angles: AFD, DFC, CFB, and BFA. Since diagonals intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. So angle AFD equals angle BFC, and angle DFC equals angle AFB.

But given that angle AFD is 34°, then angle BFC is also 34°. Also, angle DFC is 54°, so angle AFB is 54°. 

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles are 49° at A, 34° at F, and angle at D (ADF) is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, as before. So angle ADF is 97°, which is angle between AD and DF. Now, since AD is a side of the parallelogram, and DF is half of the diagonal BD. 

But how does that help with finding angle CDF?

Looking at triangle DFC. Let's consider triangle DFC. We need angle at D, which is angle CDF. To find that, we need to know two other angles in the triangle. 

We know angle at F is 54°, and if we can find angle at C, then we can calculate angle CDF. How to find angle at C?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle DFC and triangle something else. Let me think about the properties of the parallelogram. 

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, and angle DAB equals angle BCD. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. 

But angle ADC is made up of angle ADF (which we found as 97°) plus angle FDC. Wait, because angle ADC is composed of angle ADF and angle FDC. Wait, angle ADC is at vertex D, between AD and DC. Since F lies on diagonal AC, but DC is connected to D and C. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to break it down.

Point D is connected to A and C. The diagonal AC connects A to C, passing through F. So from point D, the line DC goes to C, and DA goes to A. The angle ADC is at point D between DC and DA. But we also have DF connecting D to F. So angle ADC can be divided into angle ADF (from DA to DF) and angle FDC (from DF to DC). Thus, angle ADC = angle ADF + angle FDC. 

Earlier, we found angle ADF is 97°, so angle ADC = 97° + angle FDC. But angle ADC in a parallelogram is supplementary to angle DAB. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°. 

What is angle DAB? At point A, between DA and AB. From earlier, angle DAF is given as 49°, which is part of angle DAB. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, AF is part of diagonal AC. So angle DAB is composed of angle DAF (49°) and angle FAB. Wait, but in triangle AFD, angle at A is 49°, which is angle DAF. But what about angle FAB?

Wait, in the parallelogram, AB is parallel to DC, and AD is parallel to BC. The diagonals bisect each other. So AF = FC and BF = FD. Also, in triangle ABD, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, since we know angle DAB is part of the parallelogram, and angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°, and angle ADC = 97° + angle FDC. But without knowing angle DAB, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.

Wait, but maybe we can find angle DAB. Since angle DAF is 49°, and angle FAB is part of angle DAB. But since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, but do they bisect the angles? No, only in rhombuses. In general parallelograms, diagonals don't bisect the angles unless it's a rhombus. So angle DAF is not necessarily half of angle DAB.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle AFD. We had angle at A is 49°, angle at F is 34°, angle at D is 97°, which is angle ADF. So angle ADF is 97°, which is part of angle ADC. So angle ADC = 97° + angle FDC. Also, angle ADC is supplementary to angle DAB. Let me denote angle DAB as θ. Then angle ADC = 180° - θ. Therefore:

180° - θ = 97° + angle FDC  
=> angle FDC = 180° - θ - 97° = 83° - θ  

But angle DAB is θ. How to relate θ with known quantities?

Alternatively, looking back at triangle AFD. Maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines to find ratios of sides? Since we know some lengths?

Wait, given that AD = 29, and CD = 25. Also, AB = CD = 25, BC = AD = 29. 

So in triangle AFD, sides are AD = 29, AF, DF. Wait, but we don't know AF or DF. But since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. So AF = (AC)/2, DF = (BD)/2. 

But perhaps we can use the Law of Sines in triangle AFD. In triangle AFD:

AD / sin(angle AFD) = AF / sin(angle ADF) = DF / sin(angle DAF)

So plugging in the known values:

AD = 29, angle AFD = 34°, angle ADF = 97°, angle DAF = 49°.

Thus,

29 / sin(34°) = AF / sin(97°) = DF / sin(49°)

Calculating AF and DF:

First, compute AF:

AF = [29 * sin(97°)] / sin(34°)

Similarly, DF = [29 * sin(49°)] / sin(34°)

Let me compute these values numerically. Let me approximate sine values.

sin(34°): approximately 0.5592  
sin(49°): approx 0.7547  
sin(97°): approx 0.9925  

So AF ≈ (29 * 0.9925) / 0.5592 ≈ (28.7825) / 0.5592 ≈ ~51.47 units  
DF ≈ (29 * 0.7547) / 0.5592 ≈ (21.8863) / 0.5592 ≈ ~39.13 units  

So AF ≈ 51.47, DF ≈ 39.13.

Now, since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC, so FC = AF ≈ 51.47, and FD = DF ≈ 39.13, so FB = FD ≈ 39.13.

Now, considering triangle DFC. In triangle DFC, sides are DF ≈ 39.13, FC ≈ 51.47, and DC = 25. Wait, DC is given as 25. Wait, DC is a side of the parallelogram, which is 25. Wait, but in triangle DFC, the sides are DF, FC, and DC?

Wait, triangle DFC has vertices D, F, C. So sides are DF, FC, and DC. So DC is 25, DF is approx 39.13, FC is approx 51.47. Let me verify that. Yes, DC is 25, DF is FD which we computed as ~39.13, FC is AF which is ~51.47. 

So in triangle DFC, sides are DF ≈ 39.13, FC ≈ 51.47, DC = 25. Now, using the Law of Cosines to find angles. Since we need angle at D, which is angle CDF. 

Law of Cosines formula: cos(angle) = (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)

For angle at D (CDF), the sides adjacent are DF and DC, and opposite side is FC. Wait:

Wait, angle at D is between DF and DC. So sides adjacent to angle D are DF and DC, and the side opposite is FC. Therefore:

cos(angle CDF) = (DF² + DC² - FC²) / (2 * DF * DC)

Plugging in the numbers:

DF ≈ 39.13, DC = 25, FC ≈ 51.47

Compute numerator:

(39.13² + 25² - 51.47²)

Calculate each term:

39.13² ≈ 39.13^2 ≈ 1531.1  
25² = 625  
51.47² ≈ 51.47^2 ≈ Let's compute 51^2 = 2601, 0.47^2≈0.22, and cross terms: 2*51*0.47 ≈ 47.94. So total ≈ 2601 + 47.94 + 0.22 ≈ 2649.16. Wait, but exact value might differ slightly. Alternatively, better to use calculator-like steps:

But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe approximate.

But let me proceed with the approximate values:

Numerator ≈ 1531.1 + 625 - 2649.16 ≈ (1531.1 + 625) = 2156.1 - 2649.16 ≈ -493.06

Denominator: 2 * DF * DC = 2 * 39.13 * 25 ≈ 2 * 39.13 * 25 = 78.26 * 25 ≈ 1956.5

So cos(angle CDF) ≈ -493.06 / 1956.5 ≈ -0.252

Then angle CDF ≈ arccos(-0.252) ≈ ?

Arccos(-0.252) is in the second quadrant. Let me recall that cos(104°) ≈ -0.24, cos(105°)=approx -0.2588. So since -0.252 is between -0.24 and -0.2588, so angle is between 104° and 105°. Approximately 104.5 degrees.

But the answer choices are A. 34, B. 43, C. 47, D. 77. None of these are close to 104.5. Wait, that suggests my approach might be wrong. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, hold on. This discrepancy suggests that either my assumption about the sides is incorrect, or my application of Law of Cosines was wrong.

Wait, let's double-check the triangle DFC. Is DC really 25? Yes, given that CD is 25. But in the parallelogram, DC is equal to AB, which is given as 25. So DC = 25. Correct.

Wait, but in triangle DFC, the sides are DF, FC, and DC. But FC is half of diagonal AC. Wait, but earlier I computed FC as AF ≈ 51.47. But if AC is twice that, then AC ≈ 102.94. But in reality, in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. Wait, formula: |AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²).

Given AB = 25, AD = 29. So:

|AC|² + |BD|² = 2*(25² + 29²) = 2*(625 + 841) = 2*(1466) = 2932

But if AC ≈ 102.94, then |AC|² ≈ (102.94)^2 ≈ 10596. So then |BD|² = 2932 - 10596 ≈ negative number? Which is impossible. Hence, my previous assumption that AF ≈ 51.47 and FC ≈ same must be wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, I used Law of Sines in triangle AFD, assuming that AF is a side, but in reality, AF is a segment of diagonal AC. However, the Law of Sines requires knowledge of angles and sides properly. Let me re-examine that.

In triangle AFD, angles are:

At A: 49°, at F: 34°, at D: 97°. So sides opposite these angles are:

Opposite angle A (49°) is DF.

Opposite angle F (34°) is AD (which is 29).

Opposite angle D (97°) is AF.

So according to Law of Sines:

DF / sin(49°) = AD / sin(34°) = AF / sin(97°)

So DF = [AD * sin(49°)] / sin(34°)

Which would be [29 * sin(49°)] / sin(34°)

Similarly, AF = [AD * sin(97°)] / sin(34°)

So earlier, I swapped DF and AF. Earlier I said DF = [29 * sin(49°)] / sin(34°) ≈ (29 * 0.7547)/0.5592 ≈ 39.13, which is correct.

And AF = [29 * sin(97°)] / sin(34°) ≈ (29 * 0.9925)/0.5592 ≈ 28.78 / 0.5592 ≈ 51.47. So that's correct.

But then, in triangle DFC, sides are DF ≈ 39.13, FC ≈ 51.47, and DC = 25. But if AC is AF + FC = 51.47 + 51.47 = 102.94, then as per the parallelogram law, the sum of squares of diagonals should be 2*(25² + 29²) = 2*(625 + 841) = 2*1466 = 2932.

So |AC|² + |BD|² = (102.94)^2 + |BD|² = 2932. Let me compute (102.94)^2:

Approximately, 102.94 squared: 100² = 10000, 2.94² ≈ 8.64, and 2*100*2.94 = 588. Total ≈ 10000 + 588 + 8.64 = 10596.64. So |AC|² ≈ 10596.64, then |BD|² = 2932 - 10596.64 = -7664.64, which is impossible. This indicates a contradiction, meaning my earlier assumption is wrong.

This implies that my calculation of AF and DF using Law of Sines in triangle AFD is incorrect. Why?

Because in triangle AFD, the Law of Sines applies only if the triangle is valid. But if the triangle sides derived from it lead to inconsistency with the parallelogram properties, then there must be an error in assumptions.

Wait, but why? Perhaps the angles I assumed were incorrect. Let me re-examine the angles in triangle AFD.

Earlier, I said that in triangle AFD, angle at A is 49°, angle at F is 34°, hence angle at D is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°. But this assumes that angle DAF is indeed 49°, angle AFD is 34°, and that these are the internal angles of triangle AFD. But is angle AFD actually 34°?

Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) is 34°, which is angle at F between A and D, i.e., angle AFD. So yes, that's correct. And angle DAF is 49°, which is angle at A between D and F. So that should be correct. Then why the inconsistency?

Maybe the issue is that the triangle AFD is not possible with those angles and side lengths? Or perhaps there is an error in the way the angles are being considered.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the triangle AFD is not a valid triangle? But with angles adding to 180°, it's valid.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the assumption that angle AFD is 34°, but in reality, due to the parallelogram structure, there are other relations.

Wait, let me try to re-express the Law of Sines correctly. 

In triangle AFD:

∠DAF = 49°, ∠AFD = 34°, ∠ADF = 97°.

Using Law of Sines:

AD / sin(∠AFD) = DF / sin(∠DAF) = AF / sin(∠ADF)

So:

AD / sin(34°) = DF / sin(49°)

So DF = AD * sin(49°) / sin(34°)

Similarly, AF = AD * sin(97°) / sin(34°)

These give DF and AF. But then, as before, leading to inconsistency with the parallelogram diagonal lengths.

Hmm. Let me compute the numerical values again precisely.

First, compute sin(34°), sin(49°), sin(97°):

Using calculator approximations (assuming I have access to precise values):

sin(34°) ≈ 0.559192903

sin(49°) ≈ 0.75470958

sin(97°) ≈ sin(90°+7°) = cos(7°) ≈ 0.992546

So:

DF = 29 * 0.75470958 / 0.559192903 ≈ 29 * 1.349 ≈ 29 * 1.349 ≈ 39.121

AF = 29 * 0.992546 / 0.559192903 ≈ 29 * 1.777 ≈ 51.533

So AC = AF + FC = 2*AF = 2*51.533 ≈ 103.066

BD = BF + FD = 2*BF = 2*DF = 2*39.121 ≈ 78.242

Now, check the parallelogram law: |AC|² + |BD|² should equal 2*(AB² + AD²)

AB = 25, AD = 29.

So 2*(25² + 29²) = 2*(625 + 841) = 2*1466 = 2932

Now, |AC|² + |BD|² ≈ (103.066)^2 + (78.242)^2 ≈ ?

Calculate 103.066²: Let's approximate:

(100 + 3.066)^2 = 100² + 2*100*3.066 + 3.066² ≈ 10000 + 613.2 + 9.4 ≈ 10622.6

78.242²: Let's approximate as (78 + 0.242)^2 = 78² + 2*78*0.242 + 0.242² ≈ 6084 + 37.656 + 0.058 ≈ 6121.714

Total ≈ 10622.6 + 6121.714 ≈ 16744.3, which is much larger than 2932. Clearly, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that the initial assumption about the angles in triangle AFD is incorrect.

But where is the mistake? 

Wait, the problem says that ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB || CD and AD || BC. Also, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. Given that, and the given angle measures, there must be a consistent configuration. So why is the parallelogram law giving inconsistent results?

Perhaps my interpretation of the angles is wrong. Let me re-examine the given angles.

The problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 34° → angle at F between A and D, i.e., ∠AFD = 34°

MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)) = 54° → angle at F between D and C, i.e., ∠DFC = 54°

MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)) = 49° → angle at A between D and F, i.e., ∠DAF = 49°

So in triangle AFD, ∠DAF = 49°, ∠AFD = 34°, hence ∠ADF = 97°. This seems correct.

But if this leads to inconsistency in the parallelogram law, then there must be an error in my understanding of the diagram. Perhaps the angles are not in the triangle AFD as I thought?

Wait, let me draw a rough sketch. Parallelogram ABCD, with AB || CD, AD || BC. Diagonals AC and BD meet at F. Point F is inside the parallelogram.

Angle AFD is at F, between A and D. So that's the angle between FA and FD. Angle DFC is at F, between D and C, so between FD and FC. These two angles are adjacent, forming a straight line along diagonal BD? Wait, no. Because diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. So at point F, the angles around it are:

- Between AF and BF: let's say α
- Between BF and CF: β
- Between CF and DF: γ
- Between DF and AF: δ

But since diagonals intersect, opposite angles are equal. So α = γ, β = δ.

But given that angle AFD is 34°, which is between AF and DF, which would be angle δ. And angle DFC is 54°, which is between DF and CF, which is angle γ. Wait, but if α = γ and β = δ, then if angle AFD (δ) is 34°, then angle β = 34°, and angle γ = α = ? 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. When two lines intersect, the vertical angles are equal. So angle AFD and angle BFC are vertical angles. Angle DFC and angle AFB are vertical angles.

So if angle AFD is 34°, then angle BFC is 34°. Angle DFC is 54°, so angle AFB is 54°. 

Now, at point F, the sum of angles around it is 360°. So:

angle AFD (34°) + angle DFC (54°) + angle CFB (34°) + angle BFA (54°) = 34 + 54 + 34 + 54 = 176°, which is less than 360°, which is impossible. Wait, this suggests that the given angles cannot coexist unless there's additional angles. This implies that my understanding of the angles is incorrect.

Wait, this suggests that the given angles are not all at point F. Let me recheck:

Angle AFD is at F, between A and D.

Angle DFC is at F, between D and C.

So these two angles are adjacent at point F, forming a larger angle. So angle AFD (34°) and angle DFC (54°) are adjacent, making a total angle of 34 + 54 = 88° at point F. But since diagonals intersect, there are other angles at F. 

Wait, let me think: at point F, the full circle is 360°. If angle AFD is 34°, angle DFC is 54°, then the remaining angles at F are angle CFB and angle BFA. Since diagonals intersect, these should be equal? Or not?

Actually, when two lines intersect, the vertical angles are equal. So angle AFD is vertical to angle BFC, and angle DFC is vertical to angle AFB. So if angle AFD is 34°, then angle BFC is 34°, and if angle DFC is 54°, then angle AFB is 54°. 

So the sum of angles around F is:

angle AFD (34) + angle DFC (54) + angle BFC (34) + angle AFB (54) = 34 + 54 + 34 + 54 = 176°, which is not 360°. This is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, indicating that the given angles are not compatible with each other, which suggests that there is a misunderstanding in interpreting the angles.

This indicates that the given angles might not all be at the same point F, or my interpretation is wrong. Let me revisit the problem statement.

Problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 34° → this is angle at F between A and D, i.e., ∠AFD = 34°

MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)) = 54° → this is angle at F between D and C, i.e., ∠DFC = 54°

MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)) = 49° → this is angle at A between D and F, i.e., ∠DAF = 49°

So these are three different angles: one at F, one at F, and one at A. So at point F, we have two angles: ∠AFD = 34° and ∠DFC = 54°. These two angles are adjacent, forming a linear pair along diagonal BD? No, because diagonal BD passes through F, and diagonal AC passes through F. So at point F, the angles around it are:

- Between AF and BF: let's call this α
- Between BF and CF: β
- Between CF and DF: γ
- Between DF and AF: δ

Where α + β + γ + δ = 360°

Given that ∠AFD = 34°, which is between AF and DF, so that would be angle δ = 34°

∠DFC = 54°, which is between DF and CF, so that would be angle γ = 54°

Thus, δ = 34°, γ = 54°, and the other two angles α and β are unknown. Also, since diagonals intersect, α and β are related to the other angles.

But since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, but not necessarily the angles. So α and β are not necessarily equal. However, if we assume that the other angles are determined by the fact that the sum is 360°, then:

α + β + γ + δ = 360°  
α + β + 54 + 34 = 360  
α + β = 360 - 88 = 272°

But without additional info, we can't determine α and β individually. 

However, we also have triangle AFD, where angle at A is 49°, angle at F is 34°, and angle at D is 97°, as before. But this leads to inconsistencies with the parallelogram law. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in assuming the angles in triangle AFD.

Wait, let me re-examine triangle AFD. It has vertices A, F, D. So the angles at these points are:

At A: ∠DAF = 49°

At F: ∠AFD = 34°

At D: ∠ADF = ?

Sum of angles should be 180°, so ∠ADF = 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, as before.

But if ∠ADF = 97°, then in the parallelogram, angle ADC = ∠ADC = ∠ADF + ∠FDC = 97° + ∠FDC.

But angle ADC is supplementary to angle DAB. Let's denote angle DAB as θ. Then angle ADC = 180 - θ.

So 180 - θ = 97 + ∠FDC  
=> ∠FDC = 180 - θ - 97 = 83 - θ

But angle DAB is θ, which is composed of ∠DAF (49°) and ∠FAB. Since diagonals bisect each other, but not necessarily the angles. So ∠FAB = θ - 49°. 

But how to relate this to other parts?

Alternatively, consider triangle AFB. In triangle AFB, we know angle at A is ∠FAB = θ - 49°, angle at F is ∠AFB, which is vertical to ∠DFC = 54°, so ∠AFB = 54°. So in triangle AFB, angles are:

At A: θ - 49°, at F: 54°, at B: let's call it φ.

Sum of angles: (θ - 49) + 54 + φ = 180  
φ = 180 - (θ - 49) - 54 = 180 - θ + 49 - 54 = 175 - θ

But angle at B in triangle AFB is ∠ABF. In parallelogram ABCD, angle at B is equal to angle at D, which is angle ADC = 180 - θ. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ABC + angle BAD = 180°. Angle ABC is at B, which is equal to angle ADC. 

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to use vector analysis or coordinate geometry.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the parallelogram in coordinate system.

Let me set point A at origin (0,0). Since it's a parallelogram, let me define vectors. Let me assume AB is along x-axis, and AD is in plane.

Let me denote:

Vector AB = vector from A to B = (b, 0), since AB is horizontal.

Vector AD = (d_x, d_y), such that AD has length 29.

But since ABCD is a parallelogram, coordinates:

A: (0,0)

B: (b, 0)

D: (d_x, d_y)

C: B + AD = (b + d_x, 0 + d_y)

Now, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. The coordinates of F can be found as midpoint of AC and BD, since diagonals bisect each other.

Coordinates of F: midpoint of AC: ((0 + b + d_x)/2, (0 + d_y)/2) = ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2)

Also, midpoint of BD: midpoint of B(b,0) and D(d_x, d_y) is ((b + d_x)/2, (0 + d_y)/2), same as above. Correct.

Now, let's use the given angles and lengths.

First, length AD = 29. Vector AD is from A(0,0) to D(d_x, d_y), so its length is sqrt(d_x² + d_y²) = 29.

Length CD is 25. Vector CD is from C to D: D - C = (d_x - (b + d_x), d_y - 0) = (-b, d_y). So length CD is sqrt((-b)^2 + (d_y)^2) = sqrt(b² + d_y²) = 25.

So we have:

sqrt(d_x² + d_y²) = 29 → equation (1)

sqrt(b² + d_y²) = 25 → equation (2)

Subtracting equation (2) from (1):

sqrt(d_x² + d_y²) - sqrt(b² + d_y²) = 29 - 25 = 4

But this might not be directly helpful. Instead, square both equations:

From (1): d_x² + d_y² = 841 → equation (1)

From (2): b² + d_y² = 625 → equation (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1):

d_x² - b² = 841 - 625 = 216 → d_x² = b² + 216 → equation (3)

Now, we also have angles at point F.

Let me find the coordinates of F: ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2)

Now, let's consider the given angles:

Angle DAF is 49°. This is the angle at A between DA and AF.

Vector DA is from A to D: (d_x, d_y)

Vector AF is from A to F: ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2)

The angle between DA and AF is 49°. Let's compute this angle using dot product.

The cosine of the angle between DA and AF is:

[DA • AF] / (|DA| |AF|)

DA • AF = d_x * (b + d_x)/2 + d_y * (d_y)/2 = [d_x(b + d_x) + d_y²]/2

|DA| = 29

|AF| = sqrt( [(b + d_x)/2]^2 + [d_y/2]^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt( (b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2 )

So cos(49°) = [d_x(b + d_x) + d_y²]/2 / [29 * (1/2)sqrt((b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2)] = [d_x(b + d_x) + d_y²] / [29 * sqrt((b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2)]

This seems complex, but let's simplify numerator:

d_x(b + d_x) + d_y² = d_x*b + d_x² + d_y² = d_x*b + (d_x² + d_y²) = d_x*b + 841 (from equation 1)

Denominator: 29 * sqrt((b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2)

Let me denote sqrt((b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2) as |AC|, since AC is from A(0,0) to C(b + d_x, d_y). So |AC| = sqrt[(b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2]

So cos(49°) = [d_x*b + 841] / [29 * |AC|]

This is one equation.

Additionally, we have angle AFD = 34°, which is the angle at F between A and D.

To find this angle, we can use vectors. At point F, vectors FA and FD.

Vector FA = A - F = (0 - (b + d_x)/2, 0 - d_y/2) = (- (b + d_x)/2, -d_y/2)

Vector FD = D - F = (d_x - (b + d_x)/2, d_y - d_y/2) = ((d_x - b)/2, d_y/2)

The angle between FA and FD is 34°. Using dot product:

cos(34°) = (FA • FD) / (|FA| |FD|)

Compute FA • FD:

[- (b + d_x)/2 * (d_x - b)/2] + [-d_y/2 * d_y/2] 

= [ - (b + d_x)(d_x - b)/4 ] - [d_y² / 4 ]

Note that (b + d_x)(d_x - b) = d_x² - b²

So FA • FD = [ - (d_x² - b²)/4 ] - [d_y² / 4 ] = [ -d_x² + b² - d_y² ] / 4

Now, |FA| = |FD|. Since F is the midpoint, |FA| = |FC| = |AC|/2. Also, |FD| = |FB| = |BD|/2.

But let's compute |FA| and |FD|:

|FA| = sqrt( [ (b + d_x)/2 ]² + [ d_y/2 ]² ) = (1/2) sqrt( (b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2 ) = |AC|/2

Similarly, |FD| = sqrt( [ (d_x - b)/2 ]² + [ d_y/2 ]² ) = (1/2) sqrt( (d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2 )

But (d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2 = d_x² - 2bd_x + b² + d_y² = (d_x² + d_y²) + b² - 2bd_x = 841 + b² - 2bd_x (from equation 1: d_x² + d_y² = 841)

So |FD| = (1/2) sqrt(841 + b² - 2bd_x)

But this seems complicated. Let me return to the dot product expression:

FA • FD = [ -d_x² + b² - d_y² ] / 4

But from equation (1): d_x² + d_y² = 841 → d_x² = 841 - d_y²

Substitute into the expression:

-b² + d_x² - d_y² = -b² + (841 - d_y²) - d_y² = -b² + 841 - 2d_y²

Wait, no. Original expression: -d_x² + b² - d_y² = -(d_x² + d_y²) + b² = -841 + b²

So FA • FD = (-841 + b²)/4

Thus, cos(34°) = [ (-841 + b²)/4 ] / ( |FA| |FD| )

But |FA| |FD| = (|AC|/2) * (|BD|/2) = |AC| |BD| / 4

So cos(34°) = [ (-841 + b²)/4 ] / ( |AC| |BD| / 4 ) = (b² - 841) / ( |AC| |BD| )

This gives:

cos(34°) = (b² - 841) / ( |AC| |BD| )

This is another equation. 

Now, let's also consider the angle DFC = 54°, which is the angle at F between D and C. This would involve vectors FD and FC.

Vector FD is as before: ((d_x - b)/2, d_y/2)

Vector FC = C - F = (b + d_x - (b + d_x)/2, d_y - d_y/2) = ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2)

So vector FC is ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2), same as vector AF.

Wait, vector FC is from F to C: C - F = ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2), which is the same as vector AF. So vector FC is same as AF, but direction? Wait, no. Vector AF is from A to F, while vector FC is from F to C. So they are in the same direction, but starting from different points.

Anyway, the angle between FD and FC is 54°. Let's compute this using dot product.

Vectors FD and FC:

FD = ((d_x - b)/2, d_y/2)

FC = ((b + d_x)/2, d_y/2)

Dot product FD • FC = [(d_x - b)/2 * (b + d_x)/2] + [d_y/2 * d_y/2]

= [ (d_x - b)(d_x + b) ] / 4 + d_y² / 4

= [ d_x² - b² + d_y² ] / 4

Again, from equation (1): d_x² + d_y² = 841, so:

= [841 - b²]/4

Magnitude of FD: |FD| = (1/2) sqrt( (d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2 ) = (1/2) sqrt( (d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2 )

Magnitude of FC: |FC| = |AF| = |AC|/2

So cos(54°) = [ (841 - b²)/4 ] / ( |FD| |FC| ) = [ (841 - b²)/4 ] / ( (1/2) sqrt(...) * (1/2) sqrt(...) ) )

Wait, |FD| |FC| = (1/2) sqrt(...)* (1/2) sqrt(...) = (1/4) sqrt(...) * sqrt(...)

But let's compute |FD| * |FC| = |FD| * |AF| = |FD| * |AC|/2

But this seems complex. Let me note that the denominator is |FD| |FC| = |FD| * |AF| = |FD| * |AC|/2

But this is getting too involved. Let me try to combine equations.

From the angle AFD = 34°, we had:

cos(34°) = (b² - 841) / ( |AC| |BD| )

From the angle DFC = 54°, we have:

cos(54°) = (841 - b²) / ( |AC| |BD| )

Notice that the denominators are the same, and the numerators are negatives of each other. So:

Let me denote K = |AC| |BD|

From angle AFD: cos(34°) = (b² - 841)/K

From angle DFC: cos(54°) = (841 - b²)/K = - (b² - 841)/K = -cos(34°)

So cos(54°) = -cos(34°)

But cos(54°) ≈ 0.5878, and -cos(34°) ≈ -0.8290. These are not equal, which is a contradiction. This suggests that our assumptions are wrong, or there is a mistake in the setup.

This indicates that the given angles are incompatible, which is impossible since the problem is solvable. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation of the angles.

Wait, let me re-examine the angle DFC. Is it the angle between FD and FC, or between DF and FC? The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)) = 54°, which is angle at F between D and C, so it is ∠DFC, which is between FD and FC. But in our calculation, we found that this would require cos(54°) = -cos(34°), which is not true. This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the setup, possibly in the angle measurements.

But since this is a problem given to solve, there must be a solution. Perhaps the angles are not all at the same point, or I misread them.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement:

"MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 34" → angle at F between A and D, i.e., ∠AFD = 34°

"MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,C)) = 54" → angle at F between D and C, i.e., ∠DFC = 54°

"MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)) = 49" → angle at A between D and F, i.e., ∠DAF = 49°

So these are three angles: ∠AFD = 34°, ∠DFC = 54°, ∠DAF = 49°

But from the earlier calculation, these lead to a contradiction in the cosine values. This suggests that the given angles are not possible in a parallelogram, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a miscalculation in my steps.

Let me try to use the earlier equations:

From angle AFD and DFC, we have:

cos(34°) = (b² - 841)/K

cos(54°) = (841 - b²)/K

Adding these two equations:

cos(34°) + cos(54°) = (b² - 841 + 841 - b²)/K = 0/K = 0

But cos(34°) + cos(54°) ≈ 0.8290 + 0.5878 ≈ 1.4168 ≠ 0. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that the given angles are not possible in a parallelogram, which contradicts the problem's existence. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation of the angles.

Wait, perhaps the angle DFC is not the angle between FD and FC, but between DF and FC? No, angle DFC is at F, between D and C, so it's between FD and FC.

Another possibility: maybe the angle DFC is not in the same plane, or there is a typo in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct, I must find another way.

Let me try to use the given lengths and angles to find relationships.

From earlier, we have from the parallelogram law:

|AC|² + |BD|² = 2*(AB² + AD²) = 2*(25² + 29²) = 2932

From the earlier equations, we had:

From angle DAF = 49°, and using the Law of Sines in triangle AFD, we had:

DF = [AD * sin(49°)] / sin(34°) ≈ 29 * 0.7547 / 0.5592 ≈ 39.13

AF = [AD * sin(97°)] / sin(34°) ≈ 29 * 0.9925 / 0.5592 ≈ 51.47

So |AC| = 2 * AF = 102.94, |BD| = 2 * DF = 78.26

Then |AC|² + |BD|² ≈ (102.94)^2 + (78.26)^2 ≈ 10596 + 6124 = 16720, which is much greater than 2932. This suggests that the given angles are not compatible with the parallelogram's properties, which is a problem.

But since the problem is given, perhaps the angles are not in the way I thought. Maybe angle DFC is not the angle between FD and FC, but between DF and FC, which would be the same as before. Or perhaps the angles are not in the same triangle.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not all in the same parallelogram, but in a different configuration. Or perhaps the problem involves a different type of quadrilateral, but it says it's a parallelogram.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to use the given angles to find angle CDF directly, ignoring the contradictions.

Earlier, I tried to use the Law of Cosines in triangle DFC, but it led to a large angle, which wasn't among the choices. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sides.

Let me try again, assuming that the sides DF and FC are as calculated, even though it violates the parallelogram law. Let me proceed.

In triangle DFC, sides:

DF ≈ 39.13, FC ≈ 51.47, DC = 25.

Using Law of Cosines to find angle at D (CDF):

cos(angle CDF) = (DF² + DC² - FC²) / (2 * DF * DC)

Plugging in:

DF² = (39.13)^2 ≈ 1531.1

DC² = 625

FC² = (51.47)^2 ≈ 2649.16

So numerator = 1531.1 + 625 - 2649.16 ≈ 2156.1 - 2649.16 ≈ -493.06

Denominator = 2 * 39.13 * 25 ≈ 1956.5

So cos(angle CDF) ≈ -493.06 / 1956.5 ≈ -0.252

Angle CDF ≈ arccos(-0.252) ≈ 104.5°, which is not among the options. But the closest option is D. 77, but that's still far.

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the Law of Cosines again.

Wait, in triangle DFC, the angle at D is between DF and DC. So the sides are DF, DC, and FC.

Wait, but in this case, the angle at D is opposite to FC. So the formula is:

cos(angle CDF) = (DF² + DC² - FC²) / (2 * DF * DC)

Yes, that's correct.

But if this gives angle ≈ 104.5°, and none of the options match, perhaps the error is in assuming the sides DF and FC are as calculated from the Law of Sines in triangle AFD. Maybe the angles in triangle AFD are not 49°, 34°, and 97°, but something else.

Wait, let's reconsider the angles in triangle AFD. If the given angles are not compatible with the parallelogram, perhaps the actual angles are different. Let me try to use the given angle DAF = 49° and angle AFD = 34°, and find angle ADF, then use that to find other angles.

Assume that in triangle AFD, angle at A is 49°, angle at F is 34°, so angle at D is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, as before.

But if this leads to inconsistency, perhaps the actual angle at D is different. Let me try to use the Law of Sines with the parallelogram law.

From earlier, we have:

From equations (1) and (2):

d_x² + d_y² = 841

b² + d_y² = 625

Subtract: d_x² - b² = 216 → d_x² = b² + 216

Let me assume some value for b. Let me suppose that b is such that the calculations work. Let me pick b = 12, then d_x² = 144 + 216 = 360 → d_x = sqrt(360) ≈ 18.97

Then, from equation (2): b² + d_y² = 625 → 144 + d_y² = 625 → d_y² = 481 → d_y ≈ 21.93

Now, let's compute |AC| = sqrt((b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2) = sqrt((12 + 18.97)^2 + 481) ≈ sqrt(30.97^2 + 481) ≈ sqrt(959 + 481) = sqrt(1440) ≈ 37.95

|BD| = sqrt((d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2) = sqrt((18.97 - 12)^2 + 481) = sqrt(6.97^2 + 481) ≈ sqrt(48.58 + 481) = sqrt(529.58) ≈ 23.01

Check parallelogram law: |AC|² + |BD|² ≈ 1440 + 529.58 ≈ 1969.58, whereas it should be 2932. Not matching. So this shows that with arbitrary b, it doesn't satisfy the parallelogram law.

But if we want to satisfy the parallelogram law, we need |AC|² + |BD|² = 2932. Let me express |AC| and |BD| in terms of b.

From earlier, |AC|² = (b + d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = b² + 2bd_x + d_x² + d_y^2

From equation (1): d_x² + d_y² = 841, so |AC|² = b² + 2bd_x + 841

From equation (2): b² + d_y² = 625 → d_y² = 625 - b²

From equation (3): d_x² = b² + 216

So |AC|² = b² + 2b*d_x + 841

But d_x = sqrt(b² + 216) (assuming positive root)

So |AC|² = b² + 2b*sqrt(b² + 216) + 841

Similarly, |BD|² = (d_x - b)^2 + d_y^2 = (d_x² - 2bd_x + b²) + d_y^2 = (b² + 216 - 2b*d_x + b²) + (625 - b²) = 2b² + 216 - 2b*d_x + 625 - b² = b² + 841 - 2b*d_x

So |BD|² = b² + 841 - 2b*d_x

Thus, |AC|² + |BD|² = [b² + 2b*d_x + 841] + [b² + 841 - 2b*d_x] = 2b² + 1682

According to parallelogram law, this should equal 2932:

2b² + 1682 = 2932 → 2b² = 2932 - 1682 = 1250 → b² = 625 → b = 25 or -25

So b = 25. Let's take b = 25.

Now, with b = 25, from equation (2): b² + d_y² = 625 → 625 + d_y² = 625 → d_y = 0. But this would mean that d_y = 0, making AD horizontal, which would make the parallelogram degenerate (since AD and AB would be collinear). This is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the only solution is a degenerate parallelogram, which is invalid. This confirms that the given conditions are contradictory, implying that the problem as stated has no solution under standard geometrical assumptions.

But since the problem is presented, there must be a solution, so likely I made a mistake in interpreting the angles. Let me try one last approach, assuming that the given angles are in a different configuration.

Let me consider that angle DAF is 49°, angle AFD is 34°, and angle DFC is 54°, and try to find angle CDF using triangle DFC.

In triangle DFC, we have angle at F is 54°, and we need to find angle at D. If we can find another angle, we can compute it.

Let me assume that in triangle DFC, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle at D + angle at C + 54° = 180°. If I can find angle at C, then I can find angle at D.

How to find angle at C?

Angle at C is angle FCD. Let me consider triangle FCD. But how?

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, BC = AD = 29, and DC = 25. Also, diagonals bisect each other, so BF = FD, and AF = FC.

Let me consider triangle CFD. If I can find some relations between the sides or angles.

Wait, in the parallelogram, BC = 29, and AD = 29. Also, AB = 25, CD = 25.

Let me consider triangle AFD and triangle BFC. Since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. Also, in a parallelogram, AB || CD and AD || BC. 

If I can show that triangles AFD and BFC are congruent, then corresponding angles would be equal. But since AF = FC, BF = FD, and angle AFD = angle BFC (vertical angles), then triangles AFD and BFC are congruent by SAS. Thus, angle DAF = angle FBC, and angle AFD = angle BFC, etc.

But angle DAF is 49°, so angle FBC is also 49°. In triangle BFC, angle at B is 49°, angle at F is 34° (since it's equal to angle AFD), so angle at C (angle FCB) is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°. 

Thus, angle FCB = 97°. But angle FCB is part of angle BCD of the parallelogram. Since in a parallelogram, angle BCD is equal to angle DAB. Let me denote angle DAB as θ. Then angle BCD = θ. But angle BCD is composed of angle FCB (97°) and angle FCD (which is angle FCD in triangle DFC). So:

θ = 97° + angle FCD

But in the parallelogram, angle DAB + angle ABC = 180°. Angle DAB is θ, and angle ABC is equal to angle ADC. Let me recall that angle ADC = angle ADF + angle FDC = 97° + angle FDC (from earlier). So angle ADC = 97° + angle FDC.

But in a parallelogram, angle ADC + angle DAB = 180°, so:

97° + angle FDC + θ = 180°

But θ = 97° + angle FCD, so substituting:

97° + angle FDC + 97° + angle FCD = 180°

→ angle FDC + angle FCD = 180° - 97° - 97° = -14°, which is impossible. This suggests another contradiction.

This indicates that the given angles are inconsistent with the properties of a parallelogram, which is perplexing. Given that, and since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps the intended solution is to use the given angles directly.

Let me try to consider triangle DFC. If angle DFC is 54°, and if I can find another angle, say at C, then I can find angle CDF.

If I assume that angle FCD is equal to angle DAF = 49°,
