MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how it relates to finding the measure of angle ABC. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N. There's a circle with center D, since Point D is mentioned as the center (from IsRadiusOf statements). Points A, B, C, F, J lie on this circle because they're stated to be on Circle(D). Also, lines connecting various points are given, like Line(A,B), Line(B,C), etc. Additionally, there are quadrilaterals mentioned: Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) and Quadrilateral(A,F,J,D). 

The key thing here is that D is the center of the circle. So DA, DB, DC, DF, DJ are all radii of the circle. Since all these points lie on the circle, their distances from D are equal. That means triangles like DAB, DBC, DCF, DJD (wait, maybe not DJD?), but more importantly, the segments DA, DB, DC, DF, DJ are all congruent. 

Now, looking at Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D). Since A, B, C are on the circle and D is the center, so connecting them forms a quadrilateral. Let me visualize this. If D is the center, then DA = DB = DC. Because those are radii. Wait, but the problem says that DA equals DB equals DC equals DF equals DJ, right? Because each of those line segments is a radius. So triangle DAB would be an equilateral triangle? Wait, no, unless angles are specific. But hold on, let me think again.

Since DA, DB, DC are all radii, so triangle DAB has sides DA=DB (since both are radii). Therefore, triangle DAB is isoceles with DA=DB. Similarly for other triangles involving D and another point on the circle. 

But the question is about angle ABC. So angle at point B between points A, B, C. Hmm. How do I relate that to the given information?

Let me recall some circle theorems. The central angle theorem states that the angle subtended at the center of the circle by an arc is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. But here, angle ABC isn't necessarily a central angle. However, since points A, B, C are on the circle, maybe there's something related to inscribed angles or cyclic quadrilaterals.

Wait, quadrilateral ABCD is a quadrilateral with vertices on the circle. Wait, but since D is the center, ABCD is a quadrilateral where three of its vertices (A, B, C) are on the circle and D is the center. Wait, but D is also connected to A, B, C. So ABCD is a quadrilateral where D is inside the circle? No, D is the center, so it's inside the circle. Wait, but points A, B, C are on the circle. So ABCD is a quadrilateral with three points on the circle and one at the center. Interesting.

Alternatively, perhaps ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral? But since D is the center, which is inside the circle, so ABCD is not cyclic because D is not on the circle. So that might not apply directly. Maybe I should look at triangle ABC. Wait, but angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. Let me try to find relations using coordinates or vectors, but maybe there's a better way.

Another approach: since DA, DB, DC are all radii, meaning DA=DB=DC. So triangle DAB is isoceles with DA=DB. Similarly, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC. So maybe angles at D can help us find angles at B?

Wait, but angle ABC is at point B. Let me consider triangle ABC. To find angle ABC, perhaps I can use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Suppose D is at the origin (0,0). Then points A, B, C, F, J are on the circle centered at D with radius r. Let me assume radius is 1 for simplicity.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s suppose D is at (0,0). Let me place point A somewhere on the circle. Let me pick coordinates such that point A is at (1,0). Then, since DA is a radius, point A is (1,0). Now, point B is another point on the circle. Let me assume that angle ADB is θ degrees. Then coordinates of B can be (cosθ, sinθ). Similarly, point C could be placed symmetrically. Wait, but how does quadrilateral ABCD come into play?

Wait, quadrilateral ABCD has points A, B, C, D. Since D is the center, and A, B, C are on the circle. So AB, BC, CD, DA are sides? Or is it AB, BC, CD, DA? Not sure. But since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the order matters. So AB is connected to BC, then CD, then DA. So the shape is A-B-C-D-A.

But since D is the center, and A, B, C are on the circle. So DA, DB, DC are radii. So triangle DAB, DBC, etc., are all isoceles.

But how does that relate to angle ABC? Let me think. In triangle ABC, angle at B. Let me consider vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since points A, B, C are on the circle with center D, then angles subtended by arcs can be related. For example, angle ABC would be an inscribed angle over arc AC. Wait, but angle ABC is formed by chords BA and BC. So according to the inscribed angle theorem, angle ABC would be half the measure of the arc AC that it subtends. But wait, but D is the center, so the central angle for arc AC would be angle ADC. Therefore, angle ABC = ½ * angle ADC.

Wait, that seems promising. Let me verify. If angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC, then yes, it's half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. So angle ABC = ½ * angle ADC.

Therefore, if I can find angle ADC, then divide by two to get angle ABC.

So how do I find angle ADC?

Looking back at the given data: Points A, B, C, F, J are on the circle. Lines DA, DB, DC, DF, DJ are all radii. Also, quadrilateral ABCD is given. So angle ADC is the angle at D between points A and C. Since D is the center, and A and C are points on the circle, so angle ADC is the central angle corresponding to arc AC. 

But how much is angle ADC?

To find angle ADC, perhaps we can look at the positions of points A, B, C relative to D. Since DA, DB, DC are all radii, and we know that points A, B, C are connected by lines AB, BC, etc. Also, quadrilateral ABCD is mentioned. Let me check if ABCD is a kite or something else.

Since DA = DB = DC (all radii), then in quadrilateral ABCD, sides DA and DB are equal, DB and DC are equal. Wait, but DA = DB = DC. So DA = DB, and DB = DC. So DA = DB = DC. Therefore, triangle DAB and DBC are both isoceles. But how does that affect angle ADC?

If I imagine points A, B, C arranged around the circle. Let me think of angles around D. Let me denote angle ADB as x, angle BDC as y, then angle ADC would be x + y. But how to determine x and y?

Wait, but quadrilateral ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since AB and BC are chords of the circle. Also, since DA, DB, DC are radii. Let me think about triangle DAB: DA = DB, so triangle DAB is isoceles with base AB. Therefore, angles at A and B are equal. Similarly, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC, so angles at B and C are equal.

Wait, but angle at B in triangle DAB is angle ABD. And angle at B in triangle DBC is angle CBD. So total angle at B (which is angle ABC) is angle ABD + angle CBD. 

Wait, but angle ABC is composed of angles ABD and CBD. Let me denote angle ABD as α and angle CBD as β. Then angle ABC = α + β. 

In triangle DAB, since DA = DB, the base angles at A and B are equal. So angle DAB = angle ABD = α. Similarly, in triangle DBC, since DB = DC, the base angles at B and C are equal. So angle DBC = angle BCD = β. 

But angle DAB is an angle at A in triangle DAB. But how does that relate to other parts?

Alternatively, since DA = DB, triangle DAB is isoceles with apex at D. Therefore, angle ADB = 180° - 2α. Similarly, in triangle DBC, angle BDC = 180° - 2β. 

But angle ADB and angle BDC are adjacent angles at point D, forming angle ADC. So angle ADC = angle ADB + angle BDC = [180° - 2α] + [180° - 2β] = 360° - 2(α + β). But earlier, we had that angle ABC = α + β. Therefore, angle ADC = 360° - 2(angle ABC).

But earlier, we thought angle ABC = ½ * angle ADC. Let me check consistency. From the previous reasoning, angle ABC is half of angle ADC. But according to this equation, angle ADC = 360° - 2(angle ABC). So substituting angle ABC = ½ angle ADC into that gives angle ADC = 360° - 2*(½ angle ADC) → angle ADC = 360° - angle ADC → 2 angle ADC = 360° → angle ADC = 180°, which implies angle ABC = 90°. But that contradicts the idea that angle ABC is half of angle ADC unless angle ADC is 180°, making angle ABC 90°. However, that would only happen if points A and C are diametrically opposite, but I don't know if that's the case here. 

Wait, this suggests that my initial assumption that angle ABC = ½ angle ADC may be incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! The mistake comes from assuming that angle ABC subtends arc AC. However, depending on the position of the points, angle ABC could subtend different arcs. Specifically, if points A, B, C are positioned such that when you look at angle ABC, it subtends arc AC that doesn't contain B. But since B is on the circle, the inscribed angle would depend on whether B is on the major arc or minor arc AC. However, since ABCD is a quadrilateral with D being the center, and points A, B, C on the circle, the exact positioning depends on how they are arranged.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider triangle ABC. Since points A, B, C are on the circle with center D. Let me consider the triangle ABC. If I can find the lengths of AB, BC, and AC, or some angles, then I could compute angle ABC. But without coordinates, this is difficult. 

Alternatively, since DA, DB, DC are all radii, maybe triangle DAB, DBC, etc., have some relationships. Let me think again about the quadrilateral ABCD. Since DA, DB, DC are radii, so DA=DB=DC=r. So, in triangle DAB, sides DA=DB=r, so it's isoceles. Similarly, triangle DBC has sides DB=DC=r, so also isoceles. 

Let me consider the angles at D. Let me call angle ADB as θ and angle BDC as φ. Then angle ADC = θ + φ. Also, in triangle DAB, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle at A + angle at B + angle at D = 180°. Since angle at A and angle at B are equal (because DA=DB), each is (180° - θ)/2. Similarly, in triangle DBC, angles at B and C are equal, each is (180° - φ)/2. 

Now, considering the entire quadrilateral ABCD. Let me think about the angles at B. At point B, we have angles from triangle DAB and triangle DBC. The angle at B in triangle DAB is (180° - θ)/2, and the angle at B in triangle DBC is (180° - φ)/2. These two angles together form angle ABC. So angle ABC = [(180° - θ)/2] + [(180° - φ)/2] = [180° - θ + 180° - φ]/2 = [360° - (θ + φ)]/2 = [360° - angle ADC]/2. 

But angle ABC is [360° - angle ADC]/2. Rearranged, angle ADC = 360° - 2*angle ABC. 

Earlier, I thought angle ABC was half of angle ADC, but that was under a different assumption. Now, it seems angle ABC = (360° - angle ADC)/2. Which rearranges to angle ADC = 360° - 2*angle ABC. This suggests that if I can find angle ADC, I can find angle ABC. 

But how to find angle ADC? Well, angle ADC is the central angle between points A and C. Since points A, B, C are on the circle, and D is the center. Let me consider the arcs. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, maybe there are other relationships. But I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider other elements given in the problem. 

Wait, the problem mentions several other points like F, J, and lines connecting them. Also, there's Quadrilateral A-F-J-D. Given that F and J are also on the circle. Also, lines AF, FJ, JD are present. Maybe there's symmetry here. 

For instance, if points A, F, J are connected in a quadrilateral with D, and since D is the center, maybe AFJD is a rhombus or square? Because DA, DF, DJ are all radii. So DA = DF = DJ. So in quadrilateral AFJD, DA = DF = DJ, but what about AJ? 

Wait, AFJ is a triangle with points A, F, J on the circle. So AF and FJ are chords. Also, angle at F is mentioned: Angle(F,J,D). So maybe that helps. 

Alternatively, since multiple points are on the circle and connected via lines, maybe the configuration is symmetric. Perhaps points A, B, C are equally spaced around the circle? Like, if angle ADC is 120°, then angle ABC would be (360 - 120)/2 = 120°, but that's just guessing. 

Wait, maybe I need to find angle ADC based on other information. Are there any other clues?

The problem also includes several other lines and angles. For example, angle AFB is mentioned? Wait, no, the problem says Angle(A,F,J). Let me check again:

The given angles include:

- Angle(A,B,C)
- Angle(A,D,C)
- Angle(F,J,D)
- Angle(A,F,J)

Also, there are several chords and lines. For instance, lines AF, FJ, JD. So quadrilateral AFJD has points A-F-J-D. Since DA, DF, DJ are radii, so DA=DF=DJ. Thus, triangle DAF, DFJ, DJD... Wait, DJD is a degenerate triangle. 

Wait, in quadrilateral AFJD, since DA, DF, DJ are all equal radii, then AFJD is a rhombus? No, because AF and FJ are chords, not necessarily equal to the radii. However, DA=DF=DJ, so sides DA and DF are equal, DF and DJ are equal, but AF and FJ are not necessarily equal. 

But maybe the angles in this quadrilateral can help. For example, angle at D, which is angle FJD? Or angle at J? 

Wait, angle FJD is given as one of the angles. The problem states Angle(F,J,D) is present. So that's angle at J between points F, J, D. 

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider specific cases. Let me assume that points A, B, C are arranged such that angle ADC is 120°, leading to angle ABC being (360 - 120)/2 = 120°, but that doesn't match any answer choices. Alternatively, if angle ADC is 180°, then angle ABC is (360 - 180)/2 = 90°, which is option D. 

But why would angle ADC be 180°? That would mean that points A and C are diametrically opposite. If that's the case, then angle ABC would be 90°, which matches option D. 

But how do I confirm that angle ADC is 180°? Let me think. If points A, B, C are such that when connected to D, they form straight lines. For example, if B is located such that AB and CB are symmetrical with respect to AD and CD. 

Alternatively, since DA, DB, DC are all radii, and points A, B, C are on the circle, the arrangement might form an equilateral triangle. If angle ADC is 60°, then angle ABC would be (360 - 60)/2 = 150°, which isn't among the options. 

Wait, but if angle ADC is 120°, then angle ABC is (360 - 120)/2 = 120°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ADC is 90°, leading to angle ABC being (360 - 90)/2 = 135°, which also isn't an option. 

Hmm. This suggests that my earlier approach might be missing something. Let me revisit the relationship between angle ABC and angle ADC. 

Earlier, I derived angle ABC = (360° - angle ADC)/2. But this assumes that the sum of angles around point D adds up correctly. Let me double-check this. 

At point D, the total angles around it should add up to 360°, right? Because around a point, the sum is 360°. So angle ADC is part of that. But angle ADC is made up of angles ADB and BDC, assuming points A, B, C are arranged in order around the circle. 

Wait, but if angle ADC is the central angle between A and C, passing through B, then angle ADC = angle ADB + angle BDC. So angle ADC = θ + φ. 

Then angle ABC = [ (180 - θ)/2 ] + [ (180 - φ)/2 ] = (360 - θ - φ)/2 = (360 - angle ADC)/2. 

Yes, that's correct. So angle ABC = (360 - angle ADC)/2. 

But angle ADC is the central angle between A and C. Now, if I can find angle ADC, then I can calculate angle ABC. 

How to find angle ADC? Well, if I can find the arc AC. But without knowing specific positions of points, it's tricky. However, there might be other information in the problem. 

Let me check the other given angles. For example, angle AFD, angle FJD, angle AFJ, etc. 

Wait, there's Angle(F,J,D), which is at point J between F, J, D. Since J is on the circle, and D is the center, so line DJ is a radius. Similarly, F is on the circle, so DF is a radius. So angle FJD is formed by points F, J, D. Let me consider triangle FJD. Since DF and DJ are radii, so DF=DJ, making triangle FJD isoceles with DF=DJ. Hence, angle at J is angle FJD, and the base angles at F and D are equal. 

But angle FJD is given as one of the angles. If I can find that angle, maybe I can relate it to other angles. 

Similarly, there's Angle(A,F,J). Let me think about that. It's the angle at F between points A, F, J. So angle AFJ. Since points A, F, J are on the circle, this is an inscribed angle. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Maybe there's symmetry here. 

Wait, the problem also mentions that quadrilateral A-F-J-D exists. Since DA, DF, DJ are radii, and points A, F, J are on the circle. So quadrilateral AFJD has DA, DF, DJ as sides. Wait, no, the sides are AF, FJ, JD, and DA? Or is it AF, FJ, JD, and DA? Not sure. 

But since DA, DF, DJ are all radii, and AF and FJ are chords. If AFJD is a quadrilateral, then AFJD would have sides AF, FJ, JD, and DA. Since DA and JD are radii, but AF and FJ are chords. 

Assuming that AFJD is a rhombus? No, because AF and FJ are not necessarily equal. Unless there's some symmetry. 

Alternatively, if points A, F, J are equally spaced around the circle, making angle ADF = angle FDJ = angle JDA, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if AFJD is a rectangle? No, because only DA, DF, DJ are radii. 

This seems too vague. Let me try another approach. Let's assume that the diagram is symmetric. For example, points A, B, C are placed such that angle ADC is 120°, which would make angle ABC = (360 - 120)/2 = 120°, but that's not an option. Or if angle ADC is 90°, angle ABC = 135°, not helpful. 

Wait, maybe angle ADC is 60°, then angle ABC = (360 - 60)/2 = 150°, still not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ADC is 180°, making angle ABC = (360 - 180)/2 = 90°, which is option D. But why would angle ADC be 180°? That would mean points A and C are diametrically opposite. So if points A and C are endpoints of a diameter, then angle ADC is 180°. 

But how to justify that? Let me think about the other given information. For example, there's line BC, and line BD. Since DA, DB, DC are radii, if points A and C are endpoints of a diameter, then D would be the midpoint of AC. But in that case, DC would be a radius, so DA = DC, implying that AC is a diameter. 

But then, if AC is a diameter, then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle subtending a semicircle, hence 90°. Wait! Yes! If AC is a diameter, then angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending the diameter, so it's a right angle. That would make angle ABC = 90°, which is option D. 

But how do I know that AC is a diameter? Well, if points A and C are endpoints of a diameter, then D would be the midpoint of AC. But since DA and DC are radii, then AC would be twice the radius, i.e., the diameter. So if D is the center, then AC must be a diameter. 

But why would that be the case? Because in the quadrilateral ABCD, if points A and C are on opposite ends of the circle, then AC is a diameter. But how does that follow from the given information?

Well, since DA and DC are radii, and if points A and C are such that D lies on AC, then AC would be a diameter. But does the given information ensure that D lies on AC? 

Wait, quadrilateral ABCD has points A, B, C, D. So the order is important. If ABCD is a quadrilateral, then the connections are AB, BC, CD, DA. So if D is connected to A and C, then DA and DC are sides. If AC is a diagonal, but D is the center. 

Unless points A and C are placed such that D is the midpoint of AC. But how do we know that? 

Wait, if DA and DC are radii, then DA = DC. So triangle DAC is isoceles with DA = DC. Therefore, angle DAC = angle DCA. But unless points A and C are arranged such that D is the midpoint of AC, we cannot conclude that AC is a diameter. 

However, in that case, if DA = DC, then AC is bisected by D, making D the midpoint of AC, hence AC is a diameter. Therefore, angle ADC is 180°, making angle ABC = 90°, which would be option D. 

This seems plausible. Let me verify. 

If DA = DC (given, since they are radii), then triangle DAC is isoceles with DA=DC. If D is the midpoint of AC, then AC is a diameter. But how do we know that D lies on AC? 

Because in the quadrilateral ABCD, the side CD connects to D. If we consider that D is connected to A and C, and DA and DC are radii, then AC is a chord passing through D. Wait, but unless D is on AC, which would make AC a diameter. 

Wait, but in general, if you have two points A and C on a circle with center D, and DA and DC are radii, then D is the center, so AC is a chord. The midpoint of AC would be the center only if AC is a diameter. Otherwise, the center D would not lie on AC. 

But in this case, since DA and DC are radii, and D is the center, then the distance from D to A and D to C are equal. So, if AC is a diameter, then D is the midpoint of AC. Otherwise, D is not on AC. 

But how can we deduce that D lies on AC? 

From the fact that DA and DC are radii, and D is the center. But unless there is additional information forcing AC to be a diameter, we can't assume that. 

However, there's another clue: the quadrilateral ABCD. If AC is a diameter, then ABCD would have AC as a diagonal, and D as the center. But how does this fit with the rest of the information?

Wait, but maybe angle ADC is 180°, making angle ABC = 90°, which would be the answer. Given that this is one of the options, and the other options don't seem to fit, maybe this is the intended path. 

Let me think again: if AC is a diameter, then angle ABC is 90°, which would be option D. 

But why would AC be a diameter? Because if D is the midpoint of AC, then AC is a diameter. But how do we know that D is the midpoint of AC?

Wait, since DA and DC are radii, then AC is a chord of the circle, and D is the center. The only time D lies on AC is when AC is a diameter. Otherwise, D is not on AC. 

But unless there's a reason for D to lie on AC, we can't assume that. However, given the presence of quadrilateral ABCD, which includes D as a vertex, and the fact that lines DA and DC are radii, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that D lies on AC? 

Alternatively, maybe the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral with D connected to A and C implies that AC is a diagonal, and D is the center. But without knowing more about the placement of B, it's unclear. 

Wait, but if angle ABC is supposed to be one of the options, and the only possibility that fits with the given information is 90°, then maybe that's the intended answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that since DA, DB, DC are radii, then triangles DAB, DBC, etc., are isoceles. Let me consider the angles at B. 

In triangle DAB, angles at A and B are equal. Let me call angle at B as x. Similarly, in triangle DBC, angles at B and C are equal, let's call them y. 

So angle at B in triangle DAB is x, and in triangle DBC is y. So total angle ABC = x + y. 

In triangle DAB, angles sum to 180°: angle at D (let's call it α) + 2x = 180° => α = 180° - 2x. Similarly, in triangle DBC, angle at D (call it β) + 2y = 180° => β = 180° - 2y. 

Now, the total angle around point D is the sum of all angles at D. Assuming that points A, B, C are arranged such that angles α, β, and others add up to 360°. But without knowing the number of points, it's hard to tell. 

But if we assume that there are only points A, B, C around D, then the angles at D would be α (between A and B), β (between B and C), and possibly others. But since D is the center, and there are other points like F and J, it's possible that there are more angles at D. 

However, focusing on the angles related to ABC, which involves points A, B, C. If we consider the angle at D between A and B (α) and between B and C (β), then the total angle ADC is α + β. 

From before, angle ABC = x + y. And from the triangles, α = 180 - 2x and β = 180 - 2y. So α + β = 360 - 2(x + y). 

Thus, angle ADC = 360 - 2(angle ABC). 

Rearranging, angle ABC = (360 - angle ADC)/2. 

But to find angle ABC, I need to find angle ADC. 

But how? Let me think about other given information. There's also Angle(A,D,C), which is angle ADC. Wait, the problem states Angle(A,D,C), which is angle at D between A and C. So that's exactly angle ADC. 

Wait, the problem includes Angle(A,D,C) as one of the given angles. So angle ADC is given? Or is it part of the constraints? Wait, no—the user says "GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS" includes Angle(A,B,C), Angle(A,D,C), etc. So angle ADC is given as part of the constraints? No, it's not explicitly given. Wait, the problem says "GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS" lists various things, including "Angle(A,B,C)", "Angle(A,D,C)", "Angle(F,J,D)", "Angle(A,F,J)". So angle ADC is one of the angles mentioned, but is it given as a value? No, it's just listed as a constraint. Wait, no—those are the names of the angles, but their measures are not specified. 

Wait, this is confusing. The problem says "GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS" includes "Angle(A,B,C)" and "Angle(A,D,C)" as part of the list. But these are not numerical values; they are just named angles. So we don't know their measures yet. 

So, going back, we have angle ABC = (360 - angle ADC)/2. But we don't know angle ADC. 

However, if we can find angle ADC through other means. 

Wait, but if we consider the other angles given. For example, Angle(F,J,D) is given. Let me think about that. 

Angle(F,J,D) is the angle at J between points F, J, D. Since J is on the circle, and D is the center. So DJ is a radius. Similarly, F is on the circle, so DF is a radius. Thus, triangle DFJ has DF = DJ (radii), making it isoceles with base FJ. 

So angle at J (which is angle FJD) is equal to the angle at F? No, in an isoceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Here, the two equal sides are DF and DJ, so the base is FJ, and the two equal angles are at F and J. Wait, no. In triangle DFJ, sides DF and DJ are equal, so the angles opposite them are equal. The angle opposite DF is at J, and the angle opposite DJ is at F. So angle at J (opposite DF) equals angle at F (opposite DJ). 

But angle FJD is the angle at J, so it's equal to angle at F. 

But without knowing specific measurements, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since there's Angle(A,F,J) given. Let's consider that. Angle at F between A, F, J. Since points A, F, J are on the circle, this is an inscribed angle. 

The measure of angle AFJ would be half the measure of the arc AJ that it subtends. 

But again, without knowing the arc measures, this is tricky. 

Maybe there's symmetry in the diagram. Since points A, B, C, F, J are all on the circle with center D, and lines connecting them are given, maybe the diagram is regular. For example, if points A, B, C, F, J are equally spaced around the circle, creating a regular pentagon or something similar. 

But with five points on a circle, it's possible. If they are equally spaced, each arc between consecutive points would be 72°, but this is speculation. 

Assume that points A, B, C, F, J are equally spaced around the circle. Let's say the circle is divided into 5 equal arcs of 72° each. Then, for example, angle ADC would be the central angle between A and C, which would span two arcs (A to B to C), so 2*72° = 144°. Then angle ABC would be (360 - 144)/2 = 108°, which isn't an option. 

Alternatively, if points are spaced differently. Suppose points A, B, C are separated by 120°, making angle ADC = 120°, leading to angle ABC = (360 - 120)/2 = 120°, still not matching. 

But if angle ADC is 180°, then angle ABC = 90°, which is option D. This suggests that maybe angle ADC is indeed 180°, making AC a diameter, and thus angle ABC is 90°. 

Given that this is one of the options and the logic follows, even though I couldn't fully derive it from the given information, I'll go with option D.
