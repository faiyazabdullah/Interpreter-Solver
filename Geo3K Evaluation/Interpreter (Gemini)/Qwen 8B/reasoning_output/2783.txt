<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the length of arc JK. So first, I need to recall the given information and the relationships between the points and lines here.

The problem mentions several points: A, J, K, and C. There's a circle called Circle(C). Points A, J, and K all lie on this circle because they're stated as lying on the circle. Also, there are some line segments mentioned: Line(AJ), Line(CK), and Line(CJ). 

Now, the key constraints here are that Line(AJ) is a diameter of Circle(C). That means AJ passes through the center of the circle since it's a diameter. Wait, but then there's also Line(CK) and Line(CJ) being radii. Since CK and CJ are radii, their lengths should be equal to the radius of the circle. But we're told that the length of Line(CJ) is 15 units. Therefore, the radius r of the circle is 15. 

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. The problem says IsRadiusOf(Line(C,K), Circle(C)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(C,J), Circle(C)). So both CK and CJ are radii. Therefore, their lengths are equal. And we have Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,J)), 15). So that tells us the radius r = 14? No, wait, 15. So radius is 15. Then the circumference of the circle would be 2πr, which is 2 * π * 15. But the problem also gives the formula for circumference as Mul(2, Mul(3.14159..., LengthOf(Line(C,J)))), so that checks out because 2*π*r where r=15. So that part makes sense.

Now, we need to find the length of arc JK. The problem also gives a relationship involving angles. It says that the measure of angle(K,C,J) is equal to the difference between the measure of angle(A,C,J) and angle(K,C,A). Hmm. So maybe we can use some triangle properties here?

Let me visualize the diagram. Point C is the center of the circle because lines CK and CJ are radii, meaning that C is the center. Wait, no. Wait, the circle is named Circle(C), so does that mean point C is the center? Probably yes. Because usually, when you name a circle with a point, like Circle(C), that point is the center. So C is the center of the circle. Therefore, points A, J, K are all on the circumference.

So, since C is the center, CA, CJ, CK are all radii of the circle. Therefore, each of those line segments has length 15. So CA = CJ = CK = 15.

Also, line AJ is a diameter. Since AJ is a diameter, its length would be twice the radius, so 2*15 = 30. Which makes sense because the diameter is twice the radius.

Now, looking at angles. The problem states that angle(K,C,J) equals measure of angle(A,C,J) minus measure of angle(K,C,A). So angle at point C between points K and J equals angle at C between A and J minus angle at C between K and A. Let me think about how these angles relate.

Since C is the center, angles at C are central angles corresponding to arcs. For example, angle ACJ is the central angle for arc AJ, and angle KCJ is the central angle for arc KJ. Similarly, angle KCA would be the central angle for arc KA. Wait, but I need to clarify the exact positions of the points.

But perhaps using triangle properties. Let me consider triangles involved here. Since C is the center, and A, J, K are points on the circle. Let me note down:

- Triangle CJK: since CJ and CK are both radii (length 15), so triangle CJK is isoceles with sides CJ=CK=15. The base is JK. However, we might not know much about this triangle yet.

Similarly, triangle CAJ: since CA and CJ are both radii (since A and J are on the circle), so triangle CAJ is isoceles with CA=CJ=15, and base AJ which is the diameter (so length 30). Wait, but AJ is a diameter, so angle at C for triangle CAJ would be 180 degrees because it's a straight line. Wait, no. If points A and J are endpoints of a diameter, then the angle at C between them would be a straight angle, i.e., 180 degrees. Wait, but angle ACJ is part of that. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the angle at point C between points A and J. Since A and J are two points on the circle with C as the center, and AJ is a diameter. So angle ACJ is actually the angle formed at the center between points A and J. Since AJ is a diameter, the angle ACJ would be 180 degrees. Because points A and J are directly opposite each other through the center C. So angle ACJ is 180 degrees. But then, according to the problem statement, angle(K,C,J) is equal to angle(A,C,J) minus angle(K,C,A). Let me denote angle ACJ as θ_AJ = 180°, angle KCA as θ_KA, and angle K CJ as θ_KCJ. So according to the problem, θ_KCJ = θ_AJ - θ_KCA.

Therefore, θ_KCJ = 180° - θ_KCA. But θ_KCA is the angle at point C between points K and A. So, considering that, maybe we can find θ_KCJ?

Alternatively, since points A, J, K are on the circle, and C is the center, maybe we can relate the angles based on the arcs they subtend.

Another approach: since angles at the center correspond to the arcs. So, the measure of angle ACJ is equal to the measure of arc AJ. Similarly, angle KCA corresponds to arc KA, and angle KCJ corresponds to arc KJ.

Given that, angle(K,C,J) is the measure of arc KJ, and angle(A,C,J) is the measure of arc AJ, and angle(K,C,A) is the measure of arc KA. Therefore, the equation given in the problem is:

measure(arc KJ) = measure(arc AJ) - measure(arc KA)

But since the entire circle is 360 degrees, the sum of arcs AJ + KA + ... Well, depending on the arrangement of points. Let me think. Suppose points A, J, K are arranged around the circle. Since AJ is a diameter, points A and J are diametrically opposed. Then, where is point K located?

If we imagine the circle with center C, points A and J are at opposite ends. Now, point K is another point on the circle. Depending on where K is placed, the arcs will vary. Let me assume that the points are arranged such that moving from A to J along the circumference goes through K or something else.

But given that angle KCA is part of the equation, perhaps we can consider the arcs. Let me think of the total circumference as 360 degrees. The measure of arc AJ is 180 degrees because it's a diameter. Then, arc KJ is equal to arc AJ minus arc KA. So:

arc KJ = arc AJ - arc KA => arc KJ = 180° - arc KA

But arc KA + arc KJ + arc JA? Wait, not sure. Maybe if we consider the arcs around the circle. Alternatively, since arc AJ is 180°, then arc AK plus arc KJ would make up arc AJ if K is between A and J. Or maybe not. It depends on where K is.

Alternatively, since arc AJ is 180°, and if we take arc KA and arc KJ, depending on direction. Suppose that from point K, going to A and then to J. But without knowing the exact position of K, it's hard to say. However, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since angle KCA is the central angle between K and A, so that's equal to arc KA. Similarly, angle K CJ is arc KJ. And angle ACJ is arc AJ = 180°. So according to the problem statement, arc KJ = arc AJ - arc KA. Hence, arc KJ = 180° - arc KA. Therefore, adding arc KA and arc KJ together gives 180°, which suggests that arc KA + arc KJ = 180°, implying that arc KJ = 180° - arc KA. So that seems consistent.

But how do we find the measure of arc KJ? Well, if we can find the measure of arc KA, then subtracting it from 180° would give us arc KJ. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation.

But we need more information. Let me see if there are other constraints.

We also know that the length of arc JK is related to the central angle subtended by it. The formula given in the problem says that the length of arc JK is equal to (measure of angle(K,C,J)/360) multiplied by the circumference. So:

Length of arc JK = (θ / 360) × 2πr, where θ is the measure of angle K C J (which is the central angle for arc JK).

Therefore, if we can find θ, which is the measure of angle K C J, then we can compute the arc length.

Earlier, we had that θ = arc KJ = 180° - arc KA. But unless we can find arc KA, this might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Looking back at the problem, there's another piece of information: the length of arc JK is equal to (angle(K,C,J)/360) × circumference. But the circumference is already known as 2π×15 ≈ 94.247... But maybe we can find angle(K,C,J) via triangle relations.

Wait, since we know the coordinates or positions? Not directly. But perhaps using triangle CJK. In triangle CJK, we know that CJ = CK = 15. So triangle CJK is isoceles with legs CJ and CK. Therefore, the base angles are equal. Wait, but angle at C is angle K C J, which is θ. The other two angles are at points J and K. Wait, but we don't know anything about those angles. Unless we can relate them to other parts.

Alternatively, maybe we can find angle KCA (arc KA) using triangle CKA? Wait, point A is on the circle, and point K is also on the circle. So triangle CKA has sides CK and CA both equal to 15. Therefore, triangle CKA is also isoceles with CK = CA = 15. Therefore, angle at C is angle KCA, which is equal to arc KA. So, similar to before, but again, we need more info.

But maybe combining the equations. Let me write down variables:

Let’s define:

Let α = measure of angle KCA (central angle for arc KA)

Then, measure of angle K C J = 180° - α (from earlier equation)

Therefore, arc KJ = 180° - α

But since the entire circle is 360°, and arc AJ is 180°, arc KA + arc KJ + arc something? Wait, suppose that starting from point A, going clockwise through K to J, then arc AJ is composed of arc AK + arc KJ. So arc AJ = arc AK + arc KJ = α + (180° - α) = 180°, which checks out. So that works.

But how do we find α? We need another equation. Perhaps using triangle CKA?

In triangle CKA, sides CK = CA = 15, and side KA is the chord connecting points K and A. The length of chord KA can be calculated if we know the central angle α. The chord length formula is 2r sin(α/2). So:

KA = 2 * 15 * sin(α / 2) = 30 sin(α / 2)

But do we have any information about KA? Not directly. However, maybe there's another relation involving triangle CJA or something else?

Alternatively, considering triangle CJK. Since CJ = CK = 15, triangle CJK is isoceles with base JK. The angle at C is θ = 180° - α. Therefore, the base angles at J and K are equal. Each of those angles is (180° - θ)/2 = (180° - (180° - α))/2 = α / 2.

But I'm not sure how that helps yet. Wait, but maybe there's another triangle involving point A and point K?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle AJK? But without knowing the lengths of sides, it's unclear.

Wait, but we know that AJ is a diameter of length 30. So, if we can express some relations using triangle AJK.

But AJ is 30, and points K is somewhere on the circle. Maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle AJK? But for that, we need more information.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since we need to find arc JK, which is equal to θ = 180° - α, and the length of arc JK is (θ / 360) × circumference. But we need θ. To find θ, we need to find either α or some other angle.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between angle KCA (α) and angle something else. Let me think.

From triangle CKA, which is isoceles with CK = CA = 15, and base KA. So, angle at C is α, and the base angles at K and A are equal. Let me call those angles β. So:

β = (180° - α)/2

Similarly, in triangle CJK, which is isoceles with CJ = CK = 15, angle at C is θ = 180° - α, and base angles at J and K are equal. Let's call them γ. So:

γ = (180° - θ)/2 = (180° - (180° - α))/2 = α / 2

Now, considering triangle AJK. Let me think. Points A, J, K are on the circle. So AJ is a diameter. If we connect points A, J, K, forming triangle AJK. Let me consider triangle AJK. In this triangle, we know AJ = 30, and we might be able to find other sides or angles.

But how?

Alternatively, since we know that angle at point C between points K and A is α, and angle at point C between points J and K is θ = 180° - α. Maybe there's a way to relate these angles with other parts of the diagram.

Wait, maybe considering quadrilateral AKJC? Since points A, K, J, C are connected. But C is the center. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of vectors or coordinate system. Maybe assigning coordinates to simplify.

Yes, maybe setting up coordinates would help. Let me try that.

Let’s place the circle with center at point C at the origin (0, 0). Since AJ is a diameter, let me set points A and J on the x-axis. Let me assume point A is at (-15, 0) and point J is at (15, 0), since the radius is 15. So the distance between A and J is 30, which matches the diameter.

Now, point K is another point on the circle. Let me represent its coordinates as (x, y), satisfying x² + y² = 15² = 225.

Now, we need to determine the position of K such that the given angular relations hold.

First, angle(K,C,J) is the angle at point C between points K and J. Since C is at (0,0), J is at (15,0), and K is at (x,y). So vector CK is (x, y), and vector CJ is (15, 0). The angle between these two vectors is angle K C J, which we've denoted as θ.

Similarly, angle(K,C,A) is the angle at point C between points K and A. Vector CA is (-15, 0), and vector CK is (x, y). The angle between these vectors is α.

According to the problem, θ = angle(K,C,J) = angle(A,C,J) - angle(K,C,A) = 180° - α.

But angle(A,C,J) is the angle between vectors CA and CJ, which is 180°, since CA is pointing left and CJ is pointing right. So indeed, angle(A,C,J) is 180°, so θ = 180° - α.

But we can calculate θ and α using coordinates.

Let me compute α and θ using dot product.

For angle α (between vectors CA and CK):

Vector CA = A - C = (-15, 0)
Vector CK = K - C = (x, y)

Dot product: CA · CK = (-15)(x) + 0*(y) = -15x

The magnitude of CA is sqrt((-15)^2 + 0^2) = 15

Magnitude of CK is sqrt(x² + y²) = 15 (since K is on the circle)

Thus, cos(α) = (CA · CK) / (|CA||CK|) = (-15x)/(15*15) = -x/15

Similarly, for angle θ (between vectors CK and CJ):

Vector CJ = J - C = (15, 0)
Vector CK = (x, y)

Dot product: CJ · CK = 15*x + 0*y = 15x

Magnitudes: |CJ| = 15, |CK|=15

cos(theta) = (15x)/(15*15) = x/15

But theta = 180° - alpha. So cos(theta) = cos(180° - alpha) = -cos(alpha)

From above, cos(theta) = x/15, and cos(alpha) = -x/15. Thus:

x/15 = -(-x/15) → x/15 = x/15, which holds true. Therefore, this condition is satisfied for any x. Wait, but this doesn't give new information. So this seems to indicate that our previous relation is always true, regardless of where K is. So this suggests that the given condition is automatically satisfied for any point K on the circle? But that can't be right. Wait, but maybe there's something missing here.

Wait, but the problem says that angle(K,C,J) equals angle(A,C,J) minus angle(K,C,A). Which we translated into theta = 180° - alpha. But this seems to be inherently true for any point K on the circle, because alpha is the angle between CA and CK, and theta is the angle between CK and CJ. Since CA and CJ are in opposite directions (as AJ is a diameter), the angle between CA and CJ is 180°, so theta + alpha = 180°, hence theta = 180° - alpha. This identity holds regardless of where K is on the circle. Therefore, the given condition is always true, which implies that the problem's constraint is redundant, and we cannot determine the specific location of K from it. Hence, we need another way to find the measure of theta, which is the central angle for arc JK, thus allowing us to compute arc length.

But how? Without additional constraints, there's infinite possibilities for K on the circle. However, the problem provides the length of arc JK as being equal to (theta / 360) * circumference. Wait, but the problem also gives a formula for the circumference as 2πr. But since we know r = 15, circumference is 2π*15 = 30π. So arc length is (theta / 360)*30π.

But without knowing theta, we can't compute the arc length. So there must be some missing information here. Wait, but maybe there's something else in the problem that we haven't considered yet.

Wait, the problem mentions that Line(C,K) is a radius, which we've used. Also, Line(C,J) is a radius, which is given as length 15. But maybe there's something about triangleCJK or other triangles?

Wait, but earlier we thought that the given condition was always true. So perhaps there's another condition that we missed. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says that Line(C,K) is a radius, which we've accounted for. Line(C,J) is also a radius, same as CJ. Also, Line(A,J) is a diameter. Are there any other conditions?

Wait, the problem also includes Angle(K,C,J) and Angle(K,C,A). But we have already used that relation. Wait, but maybe there's another relation involving triangle AJK?

Wait, if we consider triangle AJK, with AJ = 30, and points K on the circle. Maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle AJK?

But to apply that, we need to know something about the sides or angles of triangle AJK. However, we don't have direct information about sides KJ or KA.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that K lies on the circle, so power of a point, or something else?

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A, J, and C, and K is arbitrary on the circle, but we need to find the arc length JK. But without more info, how?

Wait, but the problem gives us the formula for the arc length of JK as (MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,J))/360) * Circumference. But that's just the standard formula. So if we could find MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,J)), which is theta, then we can compute the arc length.

But how to find theta?

Wait, but earlier we saw that theta = 180° - alpha, where alpha is angle KCA. But without more info, we can't find alpha.

Wait, but maybe there's a property we're missing. For instance, since AJ is a diameter, and K is a point on the circle, then angle AJK is a right angle? Wait, no. Only if K is on the circle, then angle AKB is a right angle if AB is a diameter. Wait, that's Thales' theorem. So if K is on the circle with diameter AJ, then triangle AJK is a right triangle with right angle at K.

Wait! Yes! Thales' theorem says that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that diameter is a right angle. So in this case, triangle AJK has AJ as diameter, so angle at K is a right angle. So angle JKA is 90 degrees.

Ah! This is crucial. So triangle AJK is a right triangle with right angle at K. Therefore, in triangle AJK, angle at K is 90°.

Now, let's use this. In triangle AJK, right-angled at K, with hypotenuse AJ = 30. So we can use Pythagoras: AK² + KJ² = AJ².

But we need to find arc length JK, which relates to angle theta (at center C). Let me think.

But in triangle AJK, we can find angles at A and J. For example, angle at A is angle JAK, and angle at J is angle AJK. These angles are related to the arcs.

But since triangle AJK is right-angled at K, angle at K is 90°, so angles at A and J add up to 90°. 

However, how does this help us? Let me think.

Alternatively, since we know that in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, and we know AJ = 30. If we can find the lengths of AK or KJ, we can find the angles.

But how?

Alternatively, using coordinates again. Let me go back to my coordinate system where C is at (0,0), A is (-15,0), J is (15,0), and K is (x,y) on the circle x² + y² = 225.

In triangle AJK, right-angled at K. So vectors KA and KJ are perpendicular. Let me verify this.

Vector KA = A - K = (-15 - x, 0 - y)
Vector KJ = J - K = (15 - x, 0 - y)

Their dot product should be zero:

KA · KJ = [(-15 - x)(15 - x)] + [(0 - y)(0 - y)] = ?

Compute the first term: (-15 - x)(15 - x) = -(15 + x)(15 - x) = -(225 - x²)

Second term: ( -y)(-y) = y²

Total: -(225 - x²) + y² = -225 + x² + y²

But since K is on the circle, x² + y² = 225. Substitute:

-225 + 225 = 0. So yes, the dot product is zero. Therefore, angle at K is indeed 90°, confirming Thales' theorem. So that's good.

Now, using this, can we find the coordinates of K or something else?

Well, we can express the sides of triangle AJK. For example, AK = sqrt[(x+15)^2 + y^2], KJ = sqrt[(x-15)^2 + y^2], and AJ = 30.

But since we also know that in triangle AJK, which is right-angled at K, we can use trigonometric ratios. For example, tan(angle at A) = opposite over adjacent = KJ / AK.

But how does this help us? Maybe relating angles in triangle AJK to the central angles.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for K, we can find the central angle theta, which is the angle between vectors CK and CJ.

Earlier, we had:

cos(theta) = x/15, since theta is the angle between CK (vector (x,y)) and CJ (vector (15,0)).

So theta = arccos(x/15). Similarly, the measure of arc JK is theta degrees, so the length is (theta/360) * circumference.

But we need to find x. How?

Wait, from triangle AJK, right-angled at K. Let me find expressions for AK and KJ.

AK² = (x + 15)^2 + y² = x² + 30x + 225 + y². But x² + y² = 225, so AK² = 225 + 30x + 225 = 450 + 30x.

Similarly, KJ² = (x - 15)^2 + y² = x² - 30x + 225 + y² = 225 - 30x + 225 = 450 - 30x.

Since triangle AJK is right-angled at K, AK² + KJ² = AJ².

Check: AK² + KJ² = (450 + 30x) + (450 - 30x) = 900, and AJ² = 30² = 900. Correct.

But this doesn't give us new info. However, perhaps using the fact that in triangle AJK, the angles at A and J relate to the arcs.

Alternatively, let's look at angle at A in triangle AJK. Let's call it φ. So φ = angle at A, which is angle JAK.

This angle φ is related to the arc JK. Wait, in circle theorems, the angle at the circumference is half the central angle subtended by the arc. So angle JAK is an inscribed angle subtending arc JK. Therefore, measure of angle JAK = (1/2) measure of arc JK.

Similarly, angle at J in triangle AJK, angle AJK, is an inscribed angle subtending arc AK. So measure of angle AJK = (1/2) measure of arc AK.

Since triangle AJK is right-angled at K, φ + ψ = 90°, where φ = angle at A, ψ = angle at J.

But also, from earlier, we had that arc KJ = 180° - arc KA. Let me denote arc KA as β, then arc KJ = 180° - β. 

But since arc KA is β, then angle AJK (ψ) = (1/2)β.

Similarly, arc KJ = 180° - β, so angle JAK (φ) = (1/2)(180° - β) = 90° - (β/2).

Since φ + ψ = 90°, substituting:

[90° - (β/2)] + [β/2] = 90°, which checks out. So this is consistent.

But still, we need to find β or something else. How?

Alternatively, using triangle AJK's angles. From triangle AJK, we can express φ and ψ in terms of the sides.

For example, in triangle AJK, tan(φ) = opposite / adjacent = KJ / AK.

But from earlier:

AK² = 450 + 30x

KJ² = 450 - 30x

So KJ / AK = sqrt(450 - 30x)/sqrt(450 + 30x)

But this expression may not be helpful directly.

Alternatively, let me express x in terms of beta. Let me recall that arc KA is β, which corresponds to central angle β. So angle KCA = β, which we had earlier. And from earlier, cos(beta) = -x/15, from the dot product calculation.

Because earlier, we had for angle alpha (which was beta, since alpha = angle KCA), cos(alpha) = -x/15. So beta = angle KCA = arccos(-x/15). Therefore, x = -15 cos(beta).

So substituting into KJ² = 450 - 30x = 450 - 30*(-15 cos(beta)) = 450 + 450 cos(beta) = 450(1 + cos(beta))

Similarly, AK² = 450 + 30x = 450 + 30*(-15 cos(beta)) = 450 - 450 cos(beta) = 450(1 - cos(beta))

Now, in triangle AJK, tan(phi) = KJ / AK = sqrt(450(1 + cos(beta))) / sqrt(450(1 - cos(beta))) ) = sqrt( (1 + cos(beta))/(1 - cos(beta)) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos(beta)):

sqrt( (1 + cos(beta))^2 / (1 - cos^2(beta)) ) = sqrt( (1 + cos(beta))^2 / sin^2(beta) ) = (1 + cos(beta))/sin(beta) = cot(beta/2)

Because using the identity (1 + cos(beta)) = 2 cos²(beta/2), and sin(beta) = 2 sin(beta/2) cos(beta/2). So:

(1 + cos(beta))/sin(beta) = [2 cos²(beta/2)]/[2 sin(beta/2) cos(beta/2)] ] = cot(beta/2)

So tan(phi) = cot(beta/2) = tan(pi/2 - beta/2). Therefore, phi = pi/2 - beta/2. 

But phi is angle at A in triangle AJK, which is also equal to (1/2) arc KJ, since it's an inscribed angle subtending arc KJ. Earlier, arc KJ = 180° - beta. So:

phi = (1/2)(180° - beta) = 90° - beta/2, which matches the above result. So this confirms consistency.

But again, this doesn't give us the value of beta or theta.

Wait, but we can relate beta to other things. Let me think. What is beta? Beta is the measure of arc KA, which is the central angle corresponding to arc KA. And since we know that in triangle CKA, which is isoceles with sides CA = CK = 15, and base KA. So the law of cosines on triangle CKA gives:

KA² = CA² + CK² - 2*CA*CK*cos(beta)

Which is KA² = 15² + 15² - 2*15*15*cos(beta) = 2*225 - 450 cos(beta) = 450(1 - cos(beta)), which matches what we had earlier for AK².

But again, this doesn't help us find beta unless we have more information about KA.

But wait, we can also relate KA to the triangle AJK. In triangle AJK, right-angled at K, so:

AK² + KJ² = 900

But from above:

AK² = 450(1 - cos(beta))

KJ² = 450(1 + cos(beta))

Adding them gives 450(1 - cos(beta)) + 450(1 + cos(beta)) = 900, which matches AJ² = 900. Again, no new info.

Hmm. So it seems that without additional constraints, we can't determine the exact value of beta. But the problem must have enough information to solve it. Where am I missing something?

Wait, let me revisit the original problem. The question asks for the length of arc JK. The problem provides a formula for the arc length: LengthOf(Arc(J,K)) = Mul(Div(MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,J)), 360), CircumferenceOf(Circle(C))). So this is the standard formula: arc length = (central angle / 360) * circumference. So if we can find the measure of angle(K,C,J), which is theta, then multiply by circumference divided by 360.

But we need to find theta. Earlier, we said that theta = 180° - beta, where beta is angle KCA (arc KA). But without knowing beta, we can't proceed. But maybe there's another relation involving beta?

Wait, but we also know that in triangle AJK, which is right-angled at K, and we can relate the sides to the angles. Let me think about the sine of angle phi or something else.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of K, and we have expressions for AK² and KJ², and we know that in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, so AK² + KJ² = 900. But we also have expressions for AK² and KJ² in terms of beta.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Let me think about the central angles. The total circumference is 360°, so arc AJ is 180°, arc KA is beta, arc KJ is 180° - beta. So the remaining arc from J to A passing through K is arc JKA, which would be arc JK + arc KA = (180° - beta) + beta = 180°, which is consistent.

But this doesn't help us directly. Wait, but what if we consider the entire circle? If we add up all arcs, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, since we know the length of arc JK is what we need, and we need to find theta = measure of arc JK. So if we can find theta, we can compute the arc length. But how?

Wait, but in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, and using the coordinates, we can find the slope of KJ or something else. Let me think.

Wait, in the coordinate system, point K is (x, y), with x² + y² = 225. The angle theta is the central angle between K and J, which is the angle between vectors CK and CJ. As previously established, cos(theta) = x/15. So theta = arccos(x/15). Therefore, if we can find x, we can find theta.

But how to find x?

Wait, in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, we can use the fact that the area is (AK * KJ)/2. But also, area can be expressed as (AJ * height)/2, but I don't know the height.

Alternatively, since we know AJ = 30, and in a right-angled triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is (product of legs)/hypotenuse. Let me recall that.

In a right-angled triangle, the altitude h from the right angle to the hypotenuse is given by h = (AK * KJ)/AJ.

But we also know that in a circle, the altitude from K to AJ is the same as the length of the perpendicular from K to the diameter AJ. But since K is on the circle, this altitude is equal to the radius times some function?

Wait, alternatively, since K is on the circle with diameter AJ, the altitude from K to AJ is equal to the radius? No, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, but in this case, since AJ is the diameter, and K is on the circle, the altitude from K to AJ is equal to the length of the perpendicular segment from K to AJ. Let me calculate this.

In coordinate terms, the line AJ is the x-axis from (-15,0) to (15,0). The point K is (x,y). The distance from K to line AJ (the x-axis) is simply |y|. Since y is positive or negative, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, it's |y|.

But in a right-angled triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse is equal to (product of legs)/hypotenuse. Here, the legs are AK and KJ, and the hypotenuse is AJ = 30. So:

altitude h = (AK * KJ)/30

But this altitude is also equal to |y|. So:

|y| = (AK * KJ)/30

But AK * KJ = sqrt(AK² * KJ²) = sqrt([450(1 - cos(beta))] * [450(1 + cos(beta))]) = sqrt(450² (1 - cos²(beta))) = 450 sin(beta)

So |y| = (450 sin(beta)) / 30 = 15 sin(beta)

But also, from earlier, in the coordinate system, point K is (x,y) on the circle x² + y² = 225. So y = ±sqrt(225 - x²). But also, from earlier, we had x = -15 cos(beta), so:

y² = 225 - x² = 225 - 225 cos²(beta) = 225(1 - cos²(beta)) = 225 sin²(beta)

So y = ±15 sin(beta). Therefore, |y| = 15 |sin(beta)|. 

But from the previous result, |y| = 15 sin(beta). Assuming that beta is between 0 and 180°, since it's an arc measure. So sin(beta) is non-negative, so |y| = 15 sin(beta). This matches. So this is consistent, but again, no new info.

But how to find beta? It seems like we're going in circles.

Wait, but maybe there's a different approach. Since we need to find arc JK, which is theta, and we know that in triangle AJK, which is right-angled at K, and we know AJ = 30. Let me consider the circumcircle of triangle AJK. Wait, but AJ is the diameter of the main circle, so the circumradius of triangle AJK is 15, since the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle. Wait, but the circumradius of a right-angled triangle is half the hypotenuse. So yes, the circumradius is 15, which matches the main circle's radius. So this is consistent.

But how does this help us? Well, perhaps using the fact that in triangle AJK, the median to the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates, maybe we can relate the angle theta to the coordinates. Recall that theta = arccos(x/15). And we need to find theta. But x is unknown.

But wait, in triangle AJK, we can find x using the coordinates. Let me think. For example, if I can find the x-coordinate of K, then I can find theta.

But how?

Wait, from the earlier relation, we have |y| = 15 sin(beta), and x = -15 cos(beta). Also, from the circle equation, x² + y² = 225. Substituting x and y:

(-15 cos(beta))² + (15 sin(beta))² = 225(cos²(beta) + sin²(beta)) = 225(1) = 225. Correct.

But again, this doesn't help.

Wait, but in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, we can find the coordinates of K in terms of the angles. Let me think about the coordinates of K.

Since AJ is the diameter from (-15,0) to (15,0), and K is a point on the circle. Let me parameterize K using an angle. Let me let the central angle from C to K be gamma, measured from the positive x-axis. Wait, but since AJ is along the x-axis, with A at (-15,0) and J at (15,0), then the angle for point K can be represented as some angle phi from the positive x-axis.

Wait, let me define phi as the angle between vector CK and the positive x-axis. So point K has coordinates (15 cos(phi), 15 sin(phi)).

Wait, but earlier I defined x as the x-coordinate of K, which would be 15 cos(phi). But earlier, I had x = -15 cos(beta), where beta is the central angle for arc KA. Let me reconcile these.

If phi is the angle from positive x-axis to CK, then the central angle from C to K is phi. The central angle from C to A is 180°, since A is at (-15,0). So the central angle between K and A is the angle between CK and CA. Since CA is pointing to (-15,0), which is 180° from the positive x-axis. So the angle between CK (phi) and CA (180°) is |180° - phi|. Let's call this beta = |180° - phi|. 

Assuming K is in the upper half-circle (y > 0), then phi is between 0° and 180°, and beta = 180° - phi. So beta = 180° - phi.

Then, the central angle for arc JK is the angle between CK and CJ. Since CJ is pointing to (15,0), which is 0° from the positive x-axis. So the central angle between CK (phi) and CJ (0°) is |phi - 0°| = phi. But since arc JK can be measured as the smaller arc, so if phi is between 0 and 180°, then arc JK is phi, assuming K is in the upper half. Wait, but this depends on the position of K.

Wait, if K is in the upper half-circle (phi between 0° and 180°), then the central angle between J (0°) and K (phi) is phi, so arc JK is phi degrees. But earlier, we had that arc JK = 180° - beta, and beta = 180° - phi. So substituting, arc JK = 180° - (180° - phi) = phi. So this is consistent. Therefore, the measure of arc JK is phi, which is the central angle between J and K, which is the same as the angle theta we were discussing earlier.

Therefore, the length of arc JK is (phi / 360) * circumference = (phi / 360) * 30π.

But we need to find phi. How?

But we also know that in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, and we can relate phi to the coordinates.

Let me recall that in this parameterization, K is at (15 cos(phi), 15 sin(phi)). Let me compute the coordinates of K and use the right-angled triangle condition.

In triangle AJK, right-angled at K. So vectors KA and KJ are perpendicular. Let me compute these vectors.

Vector KA = A - K = (-15 - 15 cos(phi), 0 - 15 sin(phi)) = (-15(1 + cos(phi)), -15 sin(phi))

Vector KJ = J - K = (15 - 15 cos(phi), 0 - 15 sin(phi)) = (15(1 - cos(phi)), -15 sin(phi))

Their dot product should be zero:

[-15(1 + cos(phi))][15(1 - cos(phi))] + [-15 sin(phi)][-15 sin(phi)] = 0

Compute each term:

First term: -15*15 * (1 + cos(phi))(1 - cos(phi)) = -225*(1 - cos²(phi)) = -225 sin²(phi)

Second term: (+15*15 sin²(phi)) = 225 sin²(phi)

Total: -225 sin²(phi) + 225 sin²(phi) = 0. So it checks out. This confirms that the condition holds for any phi, which again shows that the given condition is always satisfied, and we need another way to determine phi.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. The problem provides the length of line CJ as 15, which we already used. All other information is already incorporated. So perhaps there's insufficient data? But the problem must have a unique solution, so I must be missing something.

Wait, the problem says "Round to the nearest hundredth." So maybe there's a numerical value expected, but how?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the arc JK is a certain fraction of the circle, but without more info, it's impossible. Wait, but let me think again about the initial data.

Wait, the problem says "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,K), Circle(C))" and "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,J), Circle(C))". So CK and CJ are radii, length 15. Also, Line(A,J) is diameter, length 30. 

But what about the other lines? Are there any other constraints? Like, is there any information about the position of K relative to other points?

Wait, the problem also mentions Angle(K,C,J) and Angle(K,C,A), and the relation between them. But we've already used that relation.

Wait, but perhaps there's a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,J), Circle(C))", so AJ is a diameter. "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,K), Circle(C))" and "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,J), Circle(C))", so CK and CJ are radii. So C is the center. 

Now, since AJ is a diameter, and K is a point on the circle, then triangle AJK is right-angled at K. So, in this right-angled triangle, we can use the fact that the hypotenuse is 30, and the legs are AK and KJ. 

But without additional information about the legs, we can't determine their lengths. However, the arc length depends on the central angle, which is determined by the position of K on the circle. But since the problem provides multiple answer choices, and the arc length depends on the central angle, which can vary, this suggests that there's a missing constraint or that I made a mistake in assuming that the given condition is always satisfied.

Wait, but the problem says "Angle(K,C,J) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,J)) - MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,A))". We've shown that this is always true, but maybe there's a specific configuration where this holds? Or perhaps it's a misinterpretation of the problem.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement regarding the angles:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,J)), Sub(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,J)), MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,A))))"

So it's saying that the measure of angle(K,C,J) is equal to the measure of angle(A,C,J) minus measure of angle(K,C,A). 

But we've already established that angle(A,C,J) is 180°, and angle(K,C,J) = 180° - angle(K,C,A). So this is always true, as we showed earlier. Hence, this condition does not impose any additional constraint on the position of K. 

This suggests that the problem is underdetermined, but since it provides answer choices, there must be a unique solution. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me revisit the beginning. The problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(C))", "PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(C))", "PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(C))". So points A, J, K are on the circle. Line(A,J) is a diameter. Line(C,K) and Line(C,J) are radii. So C is the center. 

Now, the key might be in the fact that both Line(C,K) and Line(C,J) are radii, so CK and CJ are both radii, and therefore, triangle CJK is isoceles with CJ = CK = 15. So, in this triangle, the base is JK, and the two equal sides are 15 each. 

But we also know that in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, and AJ = 30. So, in triangle CJK, we can use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides.

Wait, let me try this. In triangle CJK, sides CJ = CK = 15, and side JK is unknown. Let me call it d. Then, by the Law of Cosines:

d² = CJ² + CK² - 2*CJ*CK*cos(theta), where theta is angle at C, which is angle K C J = theta.

So d² = 15² + 15² - 2*15*15*cos(theta) = 2*225 - 450 cos(theta) = 450(1 - cos(theta))

But also, in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, we have:

AJ² = AK² + KJ² = 900

And from earlier, AK² = 450(1 - cos(beta)) and KJ² = 450(1 + cos(beta)), where beta is angle KCA. But beta = 180° - theta, since theta = 180° - beta.

Substitute beta = 180° - theta into AK² and KJ²:

AK² = 450(1 - cos(180° - theta)) = 450(1 + cos(theta)) because cos(180° - theta) = -cos(theta)

Similarly, KJ² = 450(1 + cos(180° - theta)) = 450(1 - cos(theta))

Wait, this is interesting. So in triangle AJK, AK² = 450(1 + cos(theta)) and KJ² = 450(1 - cos(theta)), and their sum is 900, which matches.

But also, from triangle CJK, d = KJ, and d² = 450(1 - cos(theta)). So KJ² = 450(1 - cos(theta)) = d². But from triangle AJK, KJ² = 450(1 - cos(theta)), so this is consistent. So again, no new info.

But wait, in triangle CJK, we can also use the Law of Sines. In triangle CJK, which is isoceles with sides CJ = CK = 15, and base JK = d. The angle at C is theta, and the base angles are (180° - theta)/2 each.

So, applying the Law of Sines:

d / sin(theta) = 15 / sin((180° - theta)/2)

But sin((180° - theta)/2) = sin(90° - theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So:

d / sin(theta) = 15 / cos(theta/2)

Cross-multiplying:

d = 15 sin(theta) / cos(theta/2)

But we also have from triangle AJK, KJ = d = sqrt(450(1 - cos(theta)))

So:

sqrt(450(1 - cos(theta))) = 15 sin(theta) / cos(theta/2)

Square both sides:

450(1 - cos(theta)) = 225 sin²(theta) / cos²(theta/2)

Simplify left side: 450(1 - cos(theta))

Right side: 225 sin²(theta) / cos²(theta/2)

Divide both sides by 225:

2(1 - cos(theta)) = sin²(theta) / cos²(theta/2)

Now, let's simplify the right side. Note that sin²(theta) can be written as 4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2), using the double-angle identity sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

sin²(theta) = 4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

Thus, right side becomes:

4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) / cos²(theta/2) = 4 sin²(theta/2)

So we have:

2(1 - cos(theta)) = 4 sin²(theta/2)

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin²(theta/2), so left side is 2 * 2 sin²(theta/2) = 4 sin²(theta/2), which equals the right side. Hence, this equality holds for any theta. So again, no new information.

This suggests that there is an infinite number of solutions for theta, depending on the position of K on the circle. But the problem provides specific answer choices, so there must be a unique solution. This indicates that I must have missed a critical piece of information.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement once more. It says "Equals(LengthOf(Arc(J,K)), Mul(Div(MeasureOf(Angle(K,C,J)), 360), CircumferenceOf(Circle(C))))". This is the standard formula for arc length, so it's not giving new information. 

But maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the central angle is theta. Let me think: the measure of angle(K,C,J) is the central angle for arc JK, so it is equal to the measure of arc JK. Hence, the length of arc JK is (theta / 360) * circumference. But if we can find theta, we can compute it.

But how? If there's no additional information, it's impossible. But since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps there's a standard assumption or a missing constraint. Let me think about possible special cases.

For example, if K is positioned such that angle(K,C,J) is 90°, then arc length would be (90/360)*30π = 7.5π ≈ 23.56, which isn't among the choices. If it's 60°, arc length is (60/360)*30π = 5π ≈ 15.71, also not matching. If it's 120°, then (120/360)*30π = 10π ≈ 31.42, nope. None of these match the options given.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 6.87, B. 13.74, C. 20.62, D. 27.49. Let me calculate what these values would imply for theta.

For example, if arc length is 6.87, then 6.87 = (theta / 360) * 30π. Solving for theta: theta = (6.87 * 360) / (30π) ≈ (247.32) / 9.4248 ≈ 26.25 degrees.

Similarly, for 13.74: 13.74 = (theta / 360) * 30π → theta ≈ (13.74 * 360) / 9.4248 ≈ 520.44 / 9.4248 ≈ 55.2 degrees.

For 20.62: theta ≈ (20.62 * 360) / 9.4248 ≈ 7423.2 / 9.4248 ≈ 78.8 degrees.

For 27.49: theta ≈ (27.49 * 360) / 9.4248 ≈ 9896.4 / 9.4248 ≈ 104.9 degrees.

None of these seem to suggest a particular angle, but maybe there's a way to find theta using the given data.

Wait, let me recall that in triangle AJK, which is right-angled at K, and we have AJ = 30. If we can find the length of KJ, then we can use the relation between KJ and the central angle.

From earlier, KJ² = 450(1 - cos(theta)). Also, in triangle CJK, KJ² = 450(1 - cos(theta)).

But also, in triangle AJK, KJ is one of the legs. Let me call KJ = d. So d² = 450(1 - cos(theta)).

But also, in triangle AJK, d = KJ, and the other leg is AK = sqrt(450(1 + cos(theta))).

So, in triangle AJK, the legs are sqrt(450(1 + cos(theta)) and sqrt(450(1 - cos(theta))), and hypotenuse 30.

But also, in a right-angled triangle, the product of the legs is equal to the altitude to the hypotenuse multiplied by the hypotenuse. Wait, but we already used that.

Alternatively, let me compute the product of the legs:

AK * KJ = sqrt(450(1 + cos(theta))) * sqrt(450(1 - cos(theta))) = sqrt(450^2 (1 - cos²(theta)) ) = 450 sin(theta)

But in a right-angled triangle, this product is also equal to AJ * h, where h is the altitude to the hypotenuse. Since AJ = 30, and h = |y| = 15 sin(beta), but earlier we had |y| = 15 sin(beta) = 15 sin(180° - theta) = 15 sin(theta). So h = 15 sin(theta).

Thus, AK * KJ = 30 * 15 sin(theta) = 450 sin(theta), which matches the earlier result. Again, no new info.

At this point, it appears that the problem is underdetermined, but since it provides answer choices, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me reconsider the initial assumption that C is the center. The problem says "Circle(C)", which typically denotes a circle with center C. But is there a possibility that C is a point on the circle, and the circle is named after another point? No, usually, the notation Circle(C) means the circle with center at point C. So C is the center.

Given that, and all the relationships, it's possible that the problem expects us to realize that the arc length is determined by the right angle at K. Let me think about this.

Since triangle AJK is right-angled at K, and K is on the circle with diameter AJ, the arc JK is related to the angle at K. But how?

Wait, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle at K is 90°, and it intercepts arc AJ, which is 180°, which matches. But how does this help with arc JK?

Alternatively, since angle at K is 90°, and it is an inscribed angle, but it intercepts arc AJ, which is 180°. But we want arc JK. 

Wait, maybe using the fact that in triangle AJK, the angle at K is 90°, and using some relation between the sides and the arcs.

Alternatively, let me consider the triangle CJK. We know CJ = CK = 15, and we need to find JK. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's impossible. However, if we can relate this to triangle AJK.

Wait, in triangle AJK, we have AK and KJ as legs. Let me call AK = a, KJ = b. Then, a² + b² = 900.

But also, in triangle CJK, which has sides CJ = CK = 15, and base JK = b. Using the Law of Cosines:

b² = 15² + 15² - 2*15*15*cos(theta) = 450(1 - cos(theta)).

But also, from triangle AJK, b² = 450(1 - cos(theta)), which is the same as above. So again, no new info.

Wait, but in triangle CJK, we can also use the Law of Cosines to relate b with theta, and in triangle AJK, we can relate a and b with theta. But without additional info, it's still underdetermined.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that the problem provides specific answer choices, and assuming that there's a unique solution, perhaps the intended solution assumes that the arc JK is 60°, leading to a specific length, but this is guesswork. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me try plugging in the given answer choices and see if any of them make sense.

Take option B: 13.74. Let's calculate what this would imply for theta.

Arc length = 13.74 = (theta / 360) * 30π

Solving for theta: theta = (13.74 * 360) / (30π) ≈ (13.74 * 12) / π ≈ 164.88 / 3.1416 ≈ 52.5 degrees.

Now, if theta is 52.5°, then the arc length is 13.74. Let's see if this makes sense with other relations.

But how to verify? Let me assume theta is 52.5°, then in triangle CJK, using the Law of Cosines:

b² = 450(1 - cos(52.5°)).

Calculate cos(52.5°): approximately cos(52.5) ≈ 0.6088.

So 1 - 0.6088 = 0.3912. 450 * 0.3912 ≈ 176.04. So b ≈ sqrt(176.04) ≈ 13.27.

Now, in triangle AJK, right-angled at K, the legs are a and b, with a² + b² = 900. So a² = 900 - 176.04 = 723.96, so a ≈ 26.9.

Now, in triangle CKA, which has sides CK = 15, CA = 15, and KA = a ≈ 26.9. Let's check if this is possible.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle CKA:

KA² = 15² + 15² - 2*15*15*cos(beta), where beta is the central angle for arc KA.

So 26.9² ≈ 723.96 = 225 + 225 - 450 cos(beta) = 450(1 - cos(beta)).

So 450(1 - cos(beta)) ≈ 723.96 → 1 - cos(beta) ≈ 723.96 / 450 ≈ 1.6088. But 1 - cos(beta) cannot exceed 2, so this is possible, since cos(beta) can be as low as -1, making 1 - cos(beta) = 2.

But let's calculate cos(beta) = 1 - 723.96/450 ≈ 1 - 1.6088 = -0.6088. So beta ≈ arccos(-0.6088) ≈ 127.5°.

Now, since theta = 52.5°, and beta = 127.5°, and we had earlier that theta = 180° - beta, which would mean 52.5 = 180 - 127.5 → 52.5 = 52.5, which checks out.

So this is consistent. But how did we get here? By assuming the arc length is 13.74, which leads to a valid scenario. But how do we know this is the correct one?

Since the problem provides this option, and it fits, but how to determine which one is correct?

Wait, but this suggests that any arc length is possible, depending on the position of K. But since the problem provides answer choices, and in the absence of additional information, it's possible that the intended answer is B, 13.74, but why?

Wait, perhaps there's a missing constraint in the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,K), Circle(C))" and "IsRadiusOf(Line(C,J), Circle(C))". So CK and CJ are radii, and Line(A,J) is a diameter. But what about the position of K? Is there any other constraint?

Wait, the problem also mentions "LengthOf(Arc(J,K))" and provides a formula for it. But this is the standard formula. 

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the arc is less than 180°, and uses the smallest arc. But even then, without additional info, it's impossible to determine.

Given that, and since the problem provides answer choices, and the only way to proceed is to assume that there's a standard configuration, perhaps the arc is 60°, or 90°, etc. But none of these match the given choices.

Wait, let me try calculating the arc length for theta = 60°, which would give 60/360 * 30π = 5π ≈ 15.71, which is not an option. For theta = 90°, it's 7.5π ≈ 23.56, not an option. For theta = 120°, it's 10π ≈ 31.42, not an option. For theta = 150°, it's 12.5π ≈ 39.27. None of these match.

Wait, let me calculate the circumference:
