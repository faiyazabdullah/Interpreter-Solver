MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have triangle ABC with points M on AB and N on AC. The lines MN and BC are parallel. Also, there are some length conditions given. We need to find the value of Var (which I think is 'x') based on these constraints.

First, since MN is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC should be similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem or Thales' theorem. Wait, but the problem also mentions that Triangle(A,M,N) is similar to Triangle(A,B,C). So similarity here would mean corresponding angles are equal, which makes sense because of the parallel lines.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- Length(BM) = 24
- Length(AN) = 3x - 2
- Length(NC) = 20
- Length(AM) = 4x - 6
- And the sides of the big triangle ABC: AB = AM + BM = (4x - 6) + 24 = 4x + 18
- Similarly, AC = AN + NC = (3x - 2) + 20 = 3x + 18

Since triangles AMN ~ ABC, their corresponding sides should be proportional. Let me check the correspondence. Since MN || BC, then angle at A is common, and the other angles correspond. Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be AM / AB = AN / AC = MN / BC.

So let's compute AM/AB. AM is 4x -6, AB is 4x + 18. Then AN is 3x -2, AC is 3x + 18. So setting up ratios:

(AM)/AB = (AN)/AC

Therefore,

(4x - 6)/(4x + 18) = (3x - 2)/(3x + 18)

Cross-multiplying:

(4x - 6)(3x + 18) = (3x - 2)(4x + 18)

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: 4x*(3x) + 4x*18 -6*(3x) -6*18 = 12x² + 72x - 18x - 108 = 12x² + 54x - 108

Right side: 3x*(4x) + 3x*18 -2*(4x) -2*18 = 12x² + 54x -8x -36 = 12x² + 46x - 36

Set left and right equal:

12x² +54x -108 = 12x² +46x -36

Subtract 12x² from both sides:

54x -108 = 46x -36

Subtract 46x both sides:

8x -108 = -36

Add 108 to both sides:

8x = 72

Divide by 8:

x = 9

Wait, so x is 9? Let me check if this makes sense. Let me plug back into the equations.

Check if AM/AB equals AN/AC when x=9.

Compute AM = 4*9 -6 = 36 -6 = 30

AB = 4*9 +18 = 36 +18 = 54

So AM/AB = 30/54 = 5/9

AN = 3*9 -2 = 27 -2 =25

AC = 3*9 +18 = 27 +18=45

AN/AC =25/45=5/9. Yes, same ratio. So it checks out.

But wait, the answer choices include B as 9. So the answer should be B?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the proportion. Let me double-check.

Because the similarity between Triangle AMN and ABC. Which sides correspond?

Since MN || BC, then Triangle AMN ~ Triangle ABC with the order of vertices being A, M, N corresponding to A, B, C. Therefore, AM corresponds to AB, AN corresponds to AC, and MN corresponds to BC.

Thus, the ratio is AM / AB = AN / AC = MN / BC.

Which is exactly what I used. So my setup was correct.

Hence, solving gives x=9. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we analyze the geometric configuration involving triangle $ ABC $, with points $ M $ on segment $ AB $ and $ N $ on segment $ AC $. Given that line $ MN \parallel BC $, triangles $ AMN $ and $ ABC $ are **similar** by the **Basic Proportionality Theorem**, as they share angle $ A $ and have corresponding angles equal due to the parallelism.

---

### Step 1: Express Side Lengths in Terms of $ x $

From the given information:

- $ BM = 24 $
- $ AN = 3x - 2 $
- $ NC = 20 $
- $ AM = 4x - 6 $

Using the segment addition postulate:

- $ AB = AM + BM = (4x - 6) + 24 = 4x + 18 $
- $ AC = AN + NC = (3x - 2) + 20 = 3x + 18 $

---

### Step 2: Use Similarity Ratio Between Triangles

Given that $ \triangle AMN \sim \triangle ABC $, the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal:

$$
\frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{AN}{AC}
$$

Substitute expressions in terms of $ x $:

$$
\frac{4x - 6}{4x + 18} = \frac{3x - 2}{3x + 18}
$$

---

### Step 3: Cross-Multiply and Simplify

$$
(4x - 6)(3x + 18) = (3x - 2)(4x + 18)
$$

Expand both sides:

- Left-hand side:
  $$
  (4x)(3x) + (4x)(18) - (6)(3x) - (6)(18) = 12x^2 + 72x - 18x - 108 = 12x^2 + 54x - 108
  $$

- Right-hand side:
  $$
  (3x)(4x) + (3x)(18) - (2)(4x) - (2)(18) = 12x^2 + 54x - 8x - 36 = 12x^2 + 46x - 36
  $$

Set both sides equal:

$$
12x^2 + 54x - 108 = 12x^2 + 46x - 36
$$

Cancel $ 12x^2 $ from both sides:

$$
54x - 108 = 46x - 36
$$

Simplify:

$$
8x = 72 \Rightarrow x = 9
$$

---

### Final Verification

Plug $ x = 9 $ back into the expressions for $ AM $ and $ AB $, and $ AN $ and $ AC $:

- $ AM = 4(9) - 6 = 30 $, $ AB = 4(9) + 18 = 54 $ → $ \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{30}{54} = \frac{5}{9} $
- $ AN = 3(9) - 2 = 25 $, $ AC = 3(9) + 18 = 45 $ → $ \frac{AN}{AC} = \frac{25}{45} = \frac{5}{9} $

The similarity ratio matches, confirming our solution.

### Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
