MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a circle C with points E, F, G, H on it. Then there are lines EH and FG that intersect at point J. Both lines are chords of the circle because they're mentioned as being chords. Also, there are arcs EF and GH with their measures given in terms of VarX. The key thing here is that the measure of arc EF equals the measure of arc GH. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Arc measures relate to central angles, right? The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. Also, since these arcs are part of the same circle, maybe there's something about inscribed angles or something else?

Wait, but the problem says that both arcs EF and GH have measures expressed in terms of VarX. Let me write down the equations given:

Measure of arc EF = 10x - 4
Measure of arc GH = 8x + 6
And these two measures are equal because Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(E,F)), MeasureOf(Arc(G,H))).

So setting them equal: 10x - 4 = 8x + 6. Solving for x would give me the value. Let me check that.

Subtract 8x from both sides: 2x - 4 = 6
Then add 4 to both sides: 2x = 10
Divide by 2: x = 5. 

Wait, so x is 5? That seems straightforward. But let me make sure there's no catch here. Are there any other constraints I'm missing?

The problem mentions that lines EH and FG are chords, which means they connect two points on the circle. Their intersection at J might imply something about vertical angles or something else, but since the arcs are already equated, perhaps that's just extra information. Maybe the fact that they intersect at J relates to the arcs? Wait, but the arcs EF and GH are separate. Hmm.

Alternatively, could there be another relationship between the arcs? For example, sometimes when two chords intersect, there's a relation between the products of the segments. But in this case, the problem states that both arcs EF and GH are equal. So regardless of the position of J, the arcs themselves are equal. Therefore, my initial equation should hold. 

Let me verify the calculation again. 

Set 10x - 4 = 8x + 6. Subtract 8x: 2x -4 = 6. Add 4: 2x=10. Divide by 2: x=5. So x is 5. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 5. 

But wait, let me check if there's any possibility that the arcs are actually different? For instance, maybe they refer to major arcs or minor arcs? However, the problem didn't specify whether the arcs are major or minor. But typically, unless stated otherwise, arcs are considered minor arcs. Also, since the problem gives expressions like 10x-4 and 8x+6, if x were too large, the arc measures could exceed 360 degrees, which isn't possible. Let me check with x=5. 

For arc EF: 10*5 -4 = 50 -4 = 46 degrees. 
For arc GH: 8*5 +6 = 40 +6 = 46 degrees. So they are equal, which matches the condition. So that works. If x was 5, then both arcs are 46 degrees, which is valid. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 46, but that's the measure of the arc, not x. The question asks for x, so x is 5, which is option B. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The key was setting up the equation based on the equality of the arcs. All steps seem logical. So final answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the given relationships involving the arcs of the circle. The problem provides two expressions for the measures of arcs $ \text{EF} $ and $ \text{GH} $, and states that these arcs are **equal**:

$$
\text{Measure of } \overset{\frown}{EF} = 10x - 4
$$
$$
\text{Measure of } \overset{\frown}{GH} = 8x + 6
$$

Since the arcs are said to be equal, we can set their measures equal to each other:

$$
10x - 4 = 8x + 6
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

1. Subtract $ 8x $ from both sides:
   $$
   10x - 8x - 4 = 6
   $$
   $$
   2x - 4 = 6
   $$

2. Add 4 to both sides:
   $$
   2x = 10
   $$

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   $$
   x = 5
   $$

### Verification:

Plugging $ x = 5 $ back into the original expressions confirms the equality:

- Measure of $ \overset{\frown}{EF} = 10(5) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 $
- Measure of $ \overset{\frown}{GH} = 8(5) + 6 = 40 + 6 = 46 $

Both arcs indeed have the same measure (46Â°), satisfying the condition in the problem.

Thus, the solution is consistent and verified.
