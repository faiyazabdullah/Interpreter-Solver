MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a circle M with several points on it: F, G, H, J, K, P, L, N. The question is asking for the measure of arc HJ, given that FL is 24, HJ is 48, and the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Since all these points are on the circle centered at M, so M is the center. That means lines like MF, MG, etc., are radii. Also, chords like FG, HJ, etc., are chords of the circle. 

Given that FL is 24, which is half of HJ (since HJ is 48). Wait, but FL isn't directly related to HJ unless there's some relationship between those chords. Let me check the constraints again.

Wait, the problem says that line FL is part of the diagram. But looking back, point L is the intersection of lines FG and KM? Wait, no. The constraints say:

- IntersectAt(Line(F,G), Line(K,M), Line(L,M), Point(L)). So, line FG intersects line KM at point L, and also line LM? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Or perhaps the lines FG, KM, and LM intersect at point L? Wait, the wording is "IntersectAt(Line(F,G), Line(K,M), Line(L,M), Point(L))". Hmm, that might mean that the three lines FG, KM, and LM all intersect at point L. Wait, but Line(L,M) would be the same as Line(M,L). So, point L is the intersection of lines FG, KM, and ML? Wait, but Line(K,M) and Line(L,M) both pass through M. If they intersect at L, then L must lie on both KM and LM. Wait, that would only happen if L is M? But that can't be because L is another point. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe it's two lines intersecting at L: Line(F,G) and Line(K,M) intersect at L. Then Line(L,M) is just extending from L to M. Maybe the original statement was meant to say that Line(F,G) and Line(K,M) intersect at L. Similarly, Line(H,J) and Line(M,P) intersect at N. 

But regardless, since L is the midpoint of FG. The constraint says IsMidpointOf(L, Line(F,G)). So point L is the midpoint of chord FG. Therefore, FL is half of FG. Given that FL is 24, then FG is 48. Wait, but the length of FG is equal to HJ, which is given as 48. Because HJ is a chord of the circle. So FG and HJ are both chords of the circle with lengths 48 each. 

So, since FG and HJ are chords of the circle, their lengths are equal. Therefore, their corresponding arcs should have the same measure? Wait, no. Chords of equal length correspond to arcs of equal measure. So if FG and HJ are congruent chords, then arcs FG and HJ would be congruent. However, the problem gives us information about arc HP being 65 degrees, and asks for arc HJ. 

Wait, but how does arc HP relate to arc HJ? Let me think. Points H, J, P are on the circle. So HJ is a chord, and P is another point. Arc HP measures 65 degrees. We need to find arc HJ. 

Let me draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me consider the circle with center M. Let me note that H and J are endpoints of a chord HJ of length 48. Also, point P is another point on the circle such that arc HP measures 65 degrees. 

Since HJ is a chord of the circle, its length relates to the central angle subtended by it. The formula for chord length is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle in radians, R is the radius. But since we're dealing with degrees, maybe better to use the formula: chord length c = 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle in degrees. 

But first, let me find the radius of the circle. Since FL is 24, and FL is half of FG. Since FG is a chord of length 48, which is equal to HJ. Let me compute the radius. 

For chord FG: length c = 48 = 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle for arc FG. Similarly, for chord HJ, same length, so same central angle. But we don't know θ yet. 

Alternatively, since FL is half of FG, FL = 24, so FG = 48. Also, since L is the midpoint of FG, then ML is perpendicular to FG? Wait, yes! In a circle, the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. So since M is the center, and L is the midpoint of FG, then ML is perpendicular to FG. And similarly, since line ML is connected to point L, which is the midpoint of FG. 

Also, given that line KM passes through L, since L is the intersection of line FG and line KM. Wait, according to the constraints, IntersectAt(Line(F,G), Line(K,M), Line(L,M), Point(L)). So line FG intersects line KM at L. Which implies that line KM passes through L. So point L lies on line KM. 

Similarly, line ML connects M to L, which is the midpoint of FG, so ML is perpendicular to FG. Therefore, ML is perpendicular to FG, which is given as Perpendicular(Line(K,M), Line(F,G)). So line KM is perpendicular to FG. Hence, ML is part of line KM. 

Now, considering triangle KML? Not sure yet. But perhaps we can find relationships between angles. 

Additionally, there's another set of constraints involving point N. Line HJ intersects line MP and NP at N. Since N is the midpoint of HJ, as per IsMidpointOf(N, Line(H,J)). So N is the midpoint of HJ. Therefore, MN is perpendicular to HJ. Similarly, since MN is the line from the center to the midpoint of HJ, hence perpendicular to HJ. 

Moreover, Perpendicular(Line(M,P), Line(H,J)) is given. So line MP is perpendicular to line HJ. Therefore, line MP is perpendicular to HJ, which is consistent with N being the midpoint of HJ, meaning that MN is perpendicular to HJ. Therefore, MP is along the same line as MN? Wait, because if MP is perpendicular to HJ, and MN is also perpendicular to HJ, then points M, N, and P must be colinear. Wait, because both MN and MP are perpendicular to HJ, so they must lie on the same line. Therefore, P lies on line MN. 

Therefore, MP is part of line MN. Therefore, point P is on line MN. Also, since P is on the circle, MP is a radius. 

Now, given that arc HP measures 65 degrees. So, the arc from H to P is 65 degrees. Need to find arc HJ. 

Let me think about the positions of points H, J, P. Since HJ is a chord of length 48, and P is another point on the circle. 

Since HJ is a chord, and N is the midpoint of HJ, and MN is perpendicular to HJ. Also, MP is perpendicular to HJ, so P lies on line MN. Therefore, P is somewhere on line MN extended beyond N or M? Depending on direction. 

Let me visualize: HJ is horizontal, midpoint N. MN is vertical (perpendicular to HJ). Point P is on line MN, so vertically above or below N. 

The arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me consider the central angle for arc HP. The measure of arc HP is equal to the central angle ∠HMP. So ∠HMP = 65 degrees. 

We need to find the measure of arc HJ. Let's denote the central angle for arc HJ as θ. 

If we can relate θ to the known angle of 65 degrees, then we can find θ. 

But how?

Let me consider triangles or other relationships. Let me see:

Since HJ is a chord, and P is a point on the circle such that arc HP is 65 degrees. Also, since N is the midpoint of HJ, and MP is perpendicular to HJ, so P lies on line MN. 

Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place the circle with center at M(0,0). Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. 

Let me suppose that HJ is horizontal. Let me take HJ as a horizontal chord. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s let M be at (0, 0). Let me take HJ as horizontal. Let’s suppose that the midpoint N of HJ is at (a, b). Wait, but since MN is perpendicular to HJ, and HJ is horizontal, then MN is vertical. Therefore, if HJ is horizontal, then MN is vertical. So N is the midpoint of HJ, lying on the vertical line passing through M. Therefore, N lies on line MN. 

But since N is the midpoint of HJ, which is horizontal, then N has the same y-coordinate as M if MN is vertical. Wait, if MN is vertical, then N lies along the vertical line through M. Suppose M is at (0,0). Then line MN is the y-axis. So N is on the y-axis. Therefore, coordinates of N are (0, n), for some n. 

Then, since HJ is horizontal and N is the midpoint, H and J are symmetric with respect to N. Let me suppose that N is at (0, k). Then, H is at (-d, k) and J is at (d, k), so that HJ has length 2d. Given that HJ is 48, so 2d = 48 → d=24. So coordinates of H(-24, k), J(24, k). 

But since H and J are on the circle centered at M(0,0). So distance from M to H is the radius R. So MH^2 = (-24)^2 + k^2 = R². Similarly for MJ. 

Now, point P is on line MN, which is the y-axis. So P is at (0, p). Since P is on the circle, so OP^2 = 0^2 + p^2 = p² = R² → |p| = R. So P is either (0, R) or (0, -R). 

Arc HP measures 65 degrees. The central angle for arc HP is ∠HMP. Let me calculate that angle. 

Coordinates of H(-24, k), M(0,0), P(0,p). So vector MH is from M(0,0) to H(-24, k): direction vector (-24, k). Vector MP is from M(0,0) to P(0,p): direction vector (0, p). 

The angle between vectors MH and MP is the central angle for arc HP. Let me compute this angle using dot product. 

Dot product of MH and MP vectors is (-24)(0) + (k)(p) = kp. 

The magnitude of MH is sqrt((-24)^2 + k^2) = sqrt(576 + k²) = R. 

The magnitude of MP is sqrt(0² + p²) = |p| = R. 

So cos(theta) = (kp)/(R * R) = kp/R². 

But since P is on the circle, p² = R² ⇒ p = ±R. Let me assume p is positive (since arc HP is measured as 65 degrees; depending on direction). Let's take p = R. 

Thus, cos(theta) = (kR)/R² = k/R. 

So theta = arccos(k/R). 

But what is k? From earlier, H is at (-24, k), and since H lies on the circle, we have:

(-24)^2 + k^2 = R² ⇒ 576 + k² = R² ⇒ k² = R² - 576. 

So k = sqrt(R² - 576). 

But then, cos(theta) = k / R = sqrt(R² - 576)/R = sqrt(1 - 576/R²). 

Hmm, but without knowing R, this seems stuck. However, maybe we can find R from other information. 

Wait, there's FL = 24. Earlier, we had FL is half of FG, which is 24. Since FG is a chord of length 48. Let's work on that. 

Earlier, we considered that FL is 24, and since L is the midpoint of FG, FL = 1/2 FG. So FG = 48. 

Also, since FG is a chord, same as HJ. So same length. 

But how do we connect this with the rest? 

Alternatively, since FG is a chord, and L is its midpoint, then ML is perpendicular to FG. Also, since L is on line KM. 

From previous coordinate system, if we consider line FG. Let me see. 

Assume that in our coordinate system, FG is horizontal? No, wait. Earlier, we took HJ as horizontal. But FG is another chord. 

Wait, but in the problem, line FG is a chord, and line KM passes through L, which is the midpoint of FG. Also, line ML is perpendicular to FG. 

So if I want to model this, let's try again. 

Let me consider that FG is a horizontal chord. Then, since L is the midpoint of FG, ML is vertical. 

But earlier, we placed HJ as horizontal, with midpoint N on vertical line MN. Now, if FG is horizontal, then line ML is vertical. But in this case, line KM passes through L, which is the midpoint of FG. So point K is somewhere on the circle, and line KM goes through L. 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of coordinates, think about relationships between angles. 

We know that arc HP is 65°, so central angle ∠HMP = 65°. Let me consider triangle HMP. 

In triangle HMP, HM and PM are radii of the circle, so HM = PM = R. Therefore, triangle HMP is isoceles with HM = PM. The base angles are equal. 

So the base angles at H and P are equal. Wait, but we have the vertex angle at M being 65°, so the sum of the base angles is 180 - 65 = 115°, so each base angle is 115/2 = 57.5°. 

But how does this help us? 

Alternatively, since HJ is a chord of the circle, and we need to find the measure of arc HJ. Let me consider the central angle for arc HJ, which is θ. 

If I can relate θ to the given 65°, maybe via inscribed angles or something else. 

But how? 

Wait, maybe points H, J, P are related. For example, maybe P lies on some specific position relative to HJ. 

Since P is on line MN, which is perpendicular to HJ. So line MN is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. Therefore, P lies on this perpendicular bisector. 

Therefore, if we imagine the circle, H and J are on opposite sides of the diameter MN. 

Wait, but P is another point on the circle on line MN. So P could be diametrically opposite to some point, or in some position. 

Suppose that HJ is a chord, and P is another point on the circle on the line MN. So depending on where P is, the arc HP would vary. 

Let me think about the central angle between H and P. If I can express the central angle in terms of θ, which is arc HJ. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arcs HP and HJ. For instance, maybe arc HP plus arc PJ equals arc HJ? Not necessarily. It depends on the position of P. 

Alternatively, if I consider the total circumference. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate the angle at M (∠HMP = 65°) with the central angle over HJ. 

Let me consider that line MP is the same as line MN, since MP is perpendicular to HJ and MN is also perpendicular to HJ. Therefore, point P lies on line MN. 

So, in the circle, points H, J, and P are positioned such that P is on the line MN, which is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. 

Therefore, the line MN passes through the center M and the midpoint N of HJ. So, P is a point on line MN. Let me think about the possible positions of P. 

Case 1: P is on the extension of MN beyond N. Case 2: P is between M and N. Case 3: P is on the other side of M from N. 

But since P is on the circle, and MN is a line passing through the center, so P could be diametrically opposite to some point. 

But since arc HP is given as 65°, let's think about the central angle between H and P. 

Let me suppose that P is located such that when you go from H to P along the circle, the arc is 65°. 

But how to relate that to arc HJ. 

Perhaps if I consider the triangle formed by H, M, and J. The central angle for arc HJ is θ. So ∠HMJ = θ. 

If I can find θ, that's the answer. 

But how to find θ using the given 65°? 

Maybe there's a relationship between the angles in triangle HMP and the central angles. 

Earlier, we saw that in triangle HMP, ∠HMP = 65°, and HM = PM = R. So triangle HMP is isoceles with HM = PM. Therefore, ∠HPM = ∠PHM. 

Let me call ∠PHM = x. Then, ∠HMP = 65°, so 2x + 65 = 180 => x = (180 - 65)/2 = 57.5°. 

But what is ∠PHM? It is the angle at point H between PH and HM. 

But how does that relate to other parts of the diagram? 

Alternatively, since P lies on line MN, which is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. So, line MN passes through N, the midpoint of HJ. Therefore, line MN is the perpendicular bisector, so it contains the center M. Thus, N is the midpoint of HJ, and line MN passes through M. 

So, point N is on line MN, which is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. Therefore, N is the midpoint of HJ, and MN is perpendicular to HJ. 

So, in this setup, if I consider triangle HNJ, since N is the midpoint of HJ, and MN is perpendicular to HJ, then triangle HNJ is isoceles? No, because MN is perpendicular to HJ, making triangle MNH and MNJ right triangles. 

Wait, since MN is perpendicular to HJ, and N is the midpoint, then triangles MHN and MJN are congruent right triangles. 

So, MN is the altitude and median of triangle HJM. Wait, no, HJ is the base, and M is the apex. Wait, actually, M is the center, so MH = MJ = R. 

So, in triangle HJM, MH = MJ = R, and NJ = NH = 24 (since HJ = 48, so each half is 24). 

Wait, yes! Because HJ is 48, so N is the midpoint, so HN = NJ = 24. 

So in triangle HJM, we have MH = MJ = R, and HN = 24. Also, triangle MHN is a right triangle, since MN is perpendicular to HJ. 

Therefore, in right triangle MHN, we have:

MH² = MN² + HN² 

Which is R² = MN² + 24² 

So MN = sqrt(R² - 24²)

But MN is the distance from center M to midpoint N of chord HJ. 

Also, point P is on line MN. Let me consider the position of P. Since P is on line MN, and on the circle, then MP is a radius, so MP = R. 

But MN is the distance from M to N, which is sqrt(R² - 24²). So depending on whether P is on one side or the other of N, the length from M to P could be MN + NP or |MN - NP|. 

But since P is on the circle, MP = R. So if P is on the same side of N as M, then MP = MN + NP. Wait, but M is the center, and N is a point inside the circle. So line MN extends from M through N to the circumference. So if P is on the extension of MN beyond N, then MP = MN + NP. But since MP is R, and MN is sqrt(R² - 24²), then NP = R - MN. 

Alternatively, if P is on the other side of M from N, then MP = MN - NP, but that would require P to be closer to M than N, which might not make sense. 

But since P is on the circle, it's likely that P is on the extension of MN beyond N, so that MP = R. 

So, assuming P is on the extension of MN beyond N, then:

MP = MN + NP = R 

But MN = sqrt(R² - 24²), so:

sqrt(R² - 24²) + NP = R 

Therefore, NP = R - sqrt(R² - 24²)

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. However, we also know that the central angle between H and P is 65 degrees. 

Let me think about the central angle between H and P. This angle is ∠HMP = 65 degrees. 

In triangle HMP, we have:

HM = PM = R 

And angle at M is 65 degrees. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle HMP:

HP² = HM² + PM² - 2 * HM * PM * cos(angle HMP)

But HM = PM = R, so:

HP² = R² + R² - 2*R*R*cos(65°) 

=> HP² = 2R²(1 - cos(65°))

But HP is the length of chord HP. 

Alternatively, since HP is a chord, we can write it as 2R sin(α/2), where α is the central angle. Here, α = 65°, so:

HP = 2R sin(65° / 2) 

So HP² = 4R² sin²(32.5°) 

Setting equal to earlier expression:

4R² sin²(32.5°) = 2R²(1 - cos(65°)) 

Divide both sides by R²:

4 sin²(32.5°) = 2(1 - cos(65°))

Let me verify this identity. Using the double-angle identity: 

cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ 

So rearranged, 2sin²θ = 1 - cos(2θ). 

Here, if θ = 32.5°, then 2θ = 65°, so:

2sin²(32.5°) = 1 - cos(65°)

Multiply both sides by 2: 

4sin²(32.5°) = 2(1 - cos(65°))

Which matches. So this checks out. 

So this confirms that the calculation is consistent. 

But how does this help us find θ, the central angle for arc HJ?

Well, we need to find θ such that the chord HJ has length 48. 

As before, chord length is 2R sin(θ/2) = 48. 

So, 2R sin(θ/2) = 48 → R sin(θ/2) = 24. 

But from earlier, in triangle MHN, we have:

R² = MN² + 24² 

Where MN is the distance from M to N. 

But MN is also the distance from M to N, which is along the line MN. 

However, we also have that P is on line MN, and we've established relations involving HP. Perhaps combining these equations will allow us to solve for θ. 

Let me attempt to link these. 

From the chord HJ: R sin(θ/2) = 24. 

From triangle MHN: R² = MN² + 24². 

But MN is the distance from M to N. What is MN in terms of R and θ? 

Since N is the midpoint of HJ, and MN is the perpendicular from center to chord HJ. The standard formula for the distance from center to chord is d = R cos(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Wait, let me recall:

For a chord of length c, the distance from the center to the chord is d = R cos(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Wait, no, actually, the formula is derived as follows:

The distance d from center to chord is given by d = R cos(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Because in the right triangle formed by the center, midpoint of chord, and endpoint of chord, we have:

d = R cos(θ/2), and half-chord length is R sin(θ/2). 

Yes, because:

Half-chord length = R sin(θ/2) 

Distance from center to chord = R cos(θ/2) 

Therefore, for our case, since the chord HJ has central angle θ, then:

d = R cos(θ/2) = MN 

But from earlier, we also have:

R² = MN² + 24² 

Substituting MN = R cos(θ/2):

R² = (R cos(θ/2))² + 24² 

Expand:

R² = R² cos²(θ/2) + 576 

Bring terms together:

R² - R² cos²(θ/2) = 576 

Factor R²:

R² [1 - cos²(θ/2)] = 576 

But 1 - cos²(x) = sin²(x), so:

R² sin²(θ/2) = 576 

But from the chord length formula, we have:

R sin(θ/2) = 24 

So squaring both sides:

R² sin²(θ/2) = 576 

Which matches the left-hand side. So this is consistent. 

This shows that our equations are consistent but don't give new information. 

Therefore, we need another equation to relate to the given angle of 65 degrees. 

Recall that in triangle HMP, we have angle at M of 65 degrees. How can we relate this to θ?

Let me think about the location of point P. Since P is on line MN, which is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. So, if we consider the central angle between H and P, which is 65 degrees, then we need to relate this to the position of P on line MN. 

Let me consider the coordinates approach again. Assume M is at (0,0), N is at (0, d), where d is the distance from M to N. Wait, earlier, we said that MN = R cos(θ/2). 

Wait, earlier, we have that MN = R cos(θ/2). But from the chord length, R sin(θ/2) = 24. 

So, if we can express MN in terms of θ, and also relate it to the position of P. 

Since P is on line MN, and MP = R. 

Let me define the coordinates of P. Let's assume that line MN is the y-axis. So M is at (0,0), and N is at (0, d), where d = R cos(θ/2). 

Point P is on line MN, so its coordinates are (0, e), where e is some value. Since P is on the circle, the distance from M to P is R, so:

√(0² + e²) = |e| = R → e = ±R. 

So P is either at (0, R) or (0, -R). 

Now, we need to determine which one it is based on the arc HP measure. 

Let me assume that P is above the x-axis, so at (0, R). Then, the central angle between H and P is 65 degrees. 

To find this angle, let's find the coordinates of H. 

Since H is a point on the circle, and N is the midpoint of HJ, which is on the y-axis at (0, d). 

Since HJ is horizontal, and N is the midpoint, then H and J are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. 

Assuming HJ is horizontal, and N is at (0, d), then H is at (-24, d) and J is at (24, d), because HJ is 48 units long. 

Wait, earlier we had that the half-length of HJ is 24, so from N, moving horizontally 24 units left and right. 

So coordinates of H: (-24, d), J: (24, d). 

Now, point P is at (0, R). 

Now, we can compute the central angle between H and P. 

Vector from M to H: (-24, d)

Vector from M to P: (0, R)

The angle between these vectors is the central angle ∠HMP, which is 65 degrees. 

The cosine of this angle is the dot product divided by the product of magnitudes. 

Dot product = (-24)(0) + (d)(R) = dR

Magnitude of MH: sqrt( (-24)^2 + d^2 ) = sqrt(576 + d²) = R (since H is on the circle)

Magnitude of MP: sqrt(0^2 + R^2) = R 

So cos(angle) = (dR)/(R*R) = d/R 

Therefore, cos(∠HMP) = d/R 

But we already have that d = R cos(θ/2), from earlier. 

So cos(angle) = [R cos(θ/2)] / R = cos(θ/2) 

But we were told that this angle is 65 degrees. So:

cos(θ/2) = cos(65°) 

Therefore, θ/2 = 65°, so θ = 130°. 

Wait, but that would imply that the central angle for arc HJ is 130 degrees. So the measure of arc HJ is 130°, which corresponds to option C. 

But let me confirm this reasoning. 

Because we have that the angle between vectors MH and MP is 65°, which equals θ/2, leading to θ = 130°. 

But why is the angle between MH and MP equal to θ/2? 

Wait, no. Wait, we derived that cos(angle) = cos(θ/2), which implies angle = θ/2. But the angle between MH and MP is 65°, so θ/2 = 65°, hence θ = 130°. 

Yes, this makes sense. 

So the measure of arc HJ is θ = 130°, which is option C. 

Let me check if there are any inconsistencies. 

For example, if θ = 130°, then the central angle for HJ is 130°, which would make the arc HJ measure 130°, matching the calculation. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. 

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if angle between MH and MP is 65°, but could it be that the angle is supplementary? Like, if P is on the other side, giving angle 180° - 65° = 115°, leading to different results? 

Wait, but in our coordinate setup, we assumed P is at (0, R). If P were at (0, -R), then the angle between MH and MP would be different. Let me check. 

If P is at (0, -R), then vector MP is (0, -R). The dot product with MH vector (-24, d) would be (-24)(0) + (d)(-R) = -dR. 

So cos(angle) = -dR / (R²) = -d/R = -cos(θ/2). 

So angle would be arccos(-cos(θ/2)) = 180° - θ/2. 

But the problem states that measure of arc HP is 65°, which would mean the smaller arc, so the angle between H and P would be the smaller one. If the computed angle is 180° - θ/2, and this is 65°, then:

180° - θ/2 = 65° → θ/2 = 115° → θ = 230°, which is impossible because the maximum arc measure in a circle is 360°, but arcs are typically considered less than 180° unless specified otherwise. 

But since arc HP is given as 65°, it's the minor arc, so the angle between H and P is 65°, implying that the angle between vectors MH and MP is 65°, which leads to θ/2 = 65°, hence θ = 130°, which is valid. 

Therefore, the measure of arc HJ is 130°, so the answer is C.

### **Key Observations and Definitions**

- All points $F, G, H, J, K, P, L, N$ lie on circle $\odot M$, meaning $M$ is the **center** of the circle.
- Several important facts are explicitly stated:
  - $FL = 24$
  - $HJ = 48$
  - $m\angle HMP = 65^\circ$
  - $L$ is the **midpoint** of chord $FG$, and $N$ is the **midpoint** of chord $HJ$
  - Lines $KM$ and $LN$ are **perpendicular** to chords $FG$ and $HJ$, respectively.
- Therefore, $ML$ and $MN$ are **radii** of the circle, and they are **perpendicular** to chords $FG$ and $HJ$, respectively.

---

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

#### **1. Understand the Geometry**
- Since $L$ is the midpoint of chord $FG$, and $ML$ is perpendicular to $FG$, the segment $ML$ represents the **perpendicular from the center to the chord**, and thus forms a **right triangle** with half the chord and the radius.
- Similarly, $N$ is the midpoint of chord $HJ$, and since $MN$ is perpendicular to $HJ$, it too forms a right triangle with half the chord and the radius.
- The central angle corresponding to arc $HJ$ is the angle between vectors $\vec{MH}$ and $\vec{MJ}$, i.e., $\angle HJM = \theta$, where $\theta$ is the **central angle** of arc $HJ$.

#### **2. Use Given Information About $HJ$**
- The length of chord $HJ = 48$. 
- Since $N$ is the midpoint of $HJ$, then $HN = 24$.
- In the right triangle $\triangle MNH$, we have:
  $$
  \text{CHORD} = 2R\sin(\theta/2) = 48 \quad \Rightarrow \quad R\sin(\theta/2) = 24 \tag{1}
  $$

#### **3. Use the Given Angle Between Vectors $MH$ and $MP$**
- The angle between vectors $\vec{MH}$ and $\vec{MP}$ is given as $65^\circ$, and this is the **central angle** for arc $HP$.
- So, the central angle for arc $HP = 65^\circ$, and since $P$ lies on the same line as $MN$ (as $MP$ is perpendicular to $HJ$), the angle between $\vec{MH}$ and $\vec{MP}$ is the same as the angle between vectors $\vec{MH}$ and $\vec{MN}$, which is:
  $$
  \frac{\theta}{2} = 65^\circ \Rightarrow \theta = 130^\circ
  $$

#### **4. Final Conclusion**
- Therefore, the measure of arc $HJ$ is $\boxed{130^\circ}$, which corresponds to the central angle $\theta$.
