Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle C with points A, B, D on it. The lines AB, AD, BD form triangle ABD. Also, line AB is the diameter of the circle. Then there's an angle at D, which is angle ADB, and that's a right angle. They also say that the length of AD is 2 units. We need to find the measure of angle 2, which I think refers to angle BAD or something similar. Let me parse through each part step by step.

First, since A and B are on the circle and AB is the diameter, then by Thales' theorem, any point D on the circle will form a right angle with A and B. Wait, but they already said angle ADB is a right angle. That makes sense because AB is the diameter. So triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at D. Therefore, triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse AB.

Now, they mention that AD has length 2. Since AB is the diameter, maybe we can relate the sides using Pythagoras. But first, let's note down what we know:

- Triangle ABD is right-angled at D.
- AD = 2.
- AB is the diameter of the circle, so AB = 2R, where R is the radius of the circle.
- BD is another side of the triangle.

But wait, since AB is the diameter, then AB = 2R. Also, since triangle ABD is right-angled at D, by Pythagoras:

AB² = AD² + BD²

So (2R)² = 2² + BD² → 4R² = 4 + BD² → BD² = 4(R² - 1). Hmm, but without knowing R, how do we proceed?

Wait, but maybe we don't need R. Let's consider angles. The question asks for angle 2, which is probably angle BAD. Because in the problem statement, they mention Angle(2) and later Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90 degrees. Wait, angle BAD is the same as angle B,A,D? Wait, angle(B,A,D) would be angle at A between BA and DA. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The notation Angle(X,Y,Z) usually denotes the angle at Y between segments XY and YZ. So Angle(B,A,D) is the angle at A between BA and DA. Which is angle BAD. Similarly, Angle(A,D,B) is angle at D between AD and DB, which is the right angle. 

Then, the problem says that Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90 degrees. Wait, but earlier they mentioned Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),90), which is angle at D being 90 degrees. Now, adding angle 2 and angle BAD equals 90 degrees. So angle 2 plus angle BAD equals 90 degrees. Wait, but angle BAD is part of triangle ABD. Let me draw this mentally.

In triangle ABD, right-angled at D. So angles at A and B are complementary. That is, angle BAD + angle ABD = 90 degrees. However, according to the problem, angle 2 (which I think is angle BAD?) plus angle BAD equals 90? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90. So angle 2 plus angle BAD equals 90. If angle 2 is angle BAD, then that would imply angle BAD + angle BAD = 90, meaning angle BAD is 45 degrees. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is angle ABD? Or some other angle. Wait, perhaps angle 2 refers to angle ABD? Let me check again.

Looking back, the problem mentions:

Angle(A,D,B) is the right angle, which is angle at D. Then, Angle(2) is mentioned in the equation: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90. So Angle(2) could be angle ABD, or maybe another angle. Wait, maybe angle 2 is angle at A or B? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is referring to angle ADB? No, because angle ADB is already the right angle. Wait, the problem says:

"Angle(2)" – perhaps angle 2 is angle BAD? Maybe the problem uses angle 2 to denote angle BAD. But then why is the equation angle 2 + angle BAD = 90? That would mean angle BAD + angle BAD = 90, leading to angle BAD = 45 degrees. Which would make angle BAD 45 degrees, making the triangle a 45-45-90 triangle. But in that case, AD would equal BD, and AB would be AD * sqrt(2). Given that AD is 2, then AB would be 2*sqrt(2). But since AB is the diameter, then the radius would be sqrt(2). However, BD would also be 2. 

But wait, let's verify this. Suppose triangle ABD is a right-angled isoceles triangle, so angles at A and B are both 45 degrees. Then angle BAD is 45 degrees. So if angle 2 is angle BAD, then angle 2 would be 45 degrees, which is option B. But let me check if that's consistent with the given information.

However, there's more information here. The problem also says that LengthOf(Line(A,D)) equals 2. So AD = 2. In the case of a right-angled isoceles triangle, legs are equal. So if AD = BD = 2, then AB = 2√2. Hence, AB is the diameter, so the radius is √2. That seems okay. But is there another way to approach this?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle ABD. Let me think. If angle 2 is angle ABD, then angle ABD + angle BAD = 90 degrees. But since in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90 degrees. So angle BAD + angle ABD = 90 degrees. Thus, if angle 2 is angle ABD, then angle 2 + angle BAD = 90 degrees. Which would mean angle ABD = angle 2, and angle BAD is the other angle. But unless we have more info about the sides, how can we determine their measures?

Wait, but we know AD = 2. Let me use trigonometry. In triangle ABD, right-angled at D, with AD = 2. Let’s call angle at A as α (angle BAD), angle at B as β (angle ABD). So α + β = 90°, and tan(α) = opposite/adjacent = BD / AD. But BD is adjacent to angle α? Wait, let me get this straight.

In triangle ABD, right-angled at D. So:

- AD is one leg, BD is another leg, AB is the hypotenuse.

If we take angle at A (BAD), then the sides relative to angle A are:

Opposite side: BD

Adjacent side: AD

Therefore, tan(angle BAD) = BD / AD.

Similarly, tan(angle ABD) = AD / BD.

Since angle BAD + angle ABD = 90°, so if we let angle BAD = x, then angle ABD = 90° - x.

But we also have AD = 2. Let’s suppose angle BAD = x. Then BD = AD * tan(x) = 2 tan(x).

Also, AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = 4 + 4 tan²x = 4(1 + tan²x) = 4 sec²x. Therefore, AB = 2 secx. But AB is the diameter of the circle. However, without knowing the radius, maybe we can find relations based on other information?

Wait, but maybe there's another constraint. The problem also says that triangle ABD is inscribed in the circle C, which is consistent with AB being the diameter. But perhaps there's another property. Wait, but all three points A, B, D lie on the circle, and AB is the diameter. So the circle has diameter AB. Therefore, the radius is AB/2.

But we also have AD = 2. So AD is a chord of the circle. Let me recall that the length of a chord is related to its distance from the center. But perhaps we can use coordinates to model this.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me place the circle with diameter AB along the x-axis. Let’s assume point A is at (-r, 0), point B is at (r, 0), so that AB has length 2r. Then the center of the circle is at the origin (0,0). Point D lies somewhere on the circle, forming triangle ABD with right angle at D. Coordinates of D satisfy the circle equation x² + y² = r².

Given that AD = 2. Let me compute AD. The coordinates of A are (-r, 0), D is (x,y). So distance AD squared is (x + r)^2 + y^2 = 4. But since D lies on the circle, x² + y² = r². Substitute that into the previous equation:

(x + r)^2 + y^2 = x² + 2rx + r² + y² = (x² + y²) + 2rx + r² = r² + 2rx + r² = 2r² + 2rx = 4.

Thus, 2r² + 2rx = 4 ⇒ r² + rx = 2 ⇒ rx = 2 - r² ⇒ x = (2 - r²)/r.

But also, since D lies on the circle, x² + y² = r². Let me write x-coordinate of D as (2 - r²)/r. Then, substituting into the circle equation:

[(2 - r²)/r]^2 + y² = r² ⇒ [(4 - 4r² + r^4)/r²] + y² = r² ⇒ (4 -4r² + r^4)/r² + y² = r² ⇒ Multiply through by r²:

4 -4r² + r^4 + y² r² = r^4 ⇒ 4 -4r² + y² r² = 0 ⇒ y² r² = 4r² -4 ⇒ y² = 4 - 4/r².

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since triangle ABD is right-angled at D, and AD=2, let's use trigonometric ratios. Let me denote angle BAD as θ. Then, in triangle ABD:

AD = 2, angle at A is θ, angle at D is 90°, angle at B is 90° - θ.

Using sine function:

sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse = BD / AB.

But AB is the hypotenuse, which is the diameter. Let me denote AB = d. Then, sin(theta) = BD/d.

Also, cos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse = AD/d ⇒ cos(theta) = 2/d ⇒ d = 2 / cos(theta).

From Pythagoras, AB² = AD² + BD² ⇒ d² = 4 + BD².

Substituting d = 2 / cos(theta):

(4 / cos²(theta)) = 4 + BD².

But BD can also be expressed via angle theta. Since BD = AB * sin(theta) = (2 / cos(theta)) * sin(theta) = 2 tan(theta).

So BD = 2 tan(theta). Therefore,

d² = 4 + (2 tan(theta))² = 4 + 4 tan²(theta) = 4(1 + tan²(theta)) = 4 sec²(theta).

Which matches the earlier expression for d². So that checks out.

But how does this help us find theta? We need another relation. Wait, but we might not have enough info yet. Unless there's something else in the problem.

Wait, the problem says that the measure of angle ADB is 90 degrees, which we've used. And that angle 2 plus angle BAD equals 90 degrees. Wait, angle 2 is mentioned in the problem. Let me re-read the problem's equations.

They have:

Equals(Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))),90)

So, MeasureOf(Angle(2)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 90 degrees.

Angle(B,A,D) is angle BAD, which is theta. So MeasureOf(Angle(2)) + theta = 90 degrees. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 90° - theta.

But what is angle 2? It's unclear. Wait, maybe angle 2 is angle ABD? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle ABD. Let me assume that. Then, angle ABD = 90° - theta, since angle BAD + angle ABD = 90°. Then, if angle 2 is angle ABD, then MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 90° - theta. But the equation says MeasureOf(Angle(2)) + theta = 90°, which would be true. So this suggests that angle 2 is angle ABD. But then, how does this help us find the value?

We need more information. Let me think if there's any other condition. The problem also says that AD = 2. So AD is known. Can we express AD in terms of theta?

Yes. AD is adjacent to angle BAD (theta). In triangle ABD, AD is adjacent to theta. So cos(theta) = AD / AB ⇒ AB = AD / cos(theta) = 2 / cos(theta). As before.

But AB is the diameter of the circle. Is there a way to relate AB to AD? Maybe through the circle's properties?

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, then the radius is AB/2. Let me denote AB = d. Then radius R = d/2.

But point D lies on the circle, so the distance from D to the center O (midpoint of AB) is R. Let me calculate coordinates again. Let me place AB horizontally with midpoint at origin. So A(-d/2, 0), B(d/2, 0), center at (0,0). Point D(x,y) lies on the circle, so x² + y² = (d/2)^2.

Distance AD is between A(-d/2, 0) and D(x,y): sqrt[(x + d/2)^2 + y^2] = 2.

Squaring both sides: (x + d/2)^2 + y^2 = 4.

Expanding: x² + dx + d²/4 + y² = 4.

But since x² + y² = (d/2)^2 = d²/4, substitute:

d²/4 + dx + d²/4 = 4 ⇒ dx + d²/2 = 4 ⇒ dx = 4 - d²/2 ⇒ x = (4 - d²/2)/d = 4/d - d/2.

So x = 4/d - d/2.

But we also know that x² + y² = d²/4. Let me plug x into this equation:

[4/d - d/2]^2 + y² = d²/4.

Expand the square term:

(16/d² - 4 + d²/4) + y² = d²/4.

So combining terms:

16/d² - 4 + d²/4 + y² = d²/4 ⇒ 16/d² - 4 + y² = 0 ⇒ y² = 4 - 16/d².

But y² must be non-negative, so 4 - 16/d² ≥ 0 ⇒ 16/d² ≤ 4 ⇒ d² ≥ 4 ⇒ d ≥ 2. So the diameter AB must be at least 2 units long. 

Now, since AD = 2, and we have expressions involving d, perhaps we can find d?

But we have multiple variables here. How?

Alternatively, since AD is 2, and AB is the diameter, maybe we can relate them using the law of cosines or something else. Wait, but in triangle ABD, AD = 2, AB = d, and BD is unknown. From earlier, we had AB² = AD² + BD² ⇒ d² = 4 + BD². Also, from the coordinates above, we have expressions for x and y. But I'm not sure how to connect this.

Wait, but if we look back at the equation for y²: y² = 4 - 16/d². Also, since y² is non-negative, this gives us the constraint that d ≥ 2. But how does this help?

Perhaps there's another relationship. For instance, in triangle ABD, since it's right-angled at D, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. But I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that AD is a chord of the circle, and apply the formula for the length of a chord. The length of chord AD is given by 2R sin(theta), where theta is half the central angle subtended by the chord. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the length of chord AD is 2 units. The formula for chord length is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, and D is a point on the circle, then the angle ADB is 90 degrees. But we already used that. 

Wait, going back to the earlier equation, we have:

y² = 4 - 16/d².

But since D lies on the circle, x² + y² = (d/2)^2. Substituting y²:

x² + [4 - 16/d²] = d²/4 ⇒ x² = d²/4 - 4 + 16/d².

But from earlier, x = 4/d - d/2. So x² = (4/d - d/2)^2 = 16/d² - 4 + d²/4.

Which matches the above expression for x². So nothing new here.

Maybe we need to find the value of d such that the coordinates are valid. But how?

Wait, we also have that AD = 2. But AD is the distance between A and D, which we already used. So this hasn't given us new info. 

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let me think differently. Since we have angle 2 plus angle BAD equals 90 degrees, and angle BAD is theta, then angle 2 = 90° - theta. If we can find theta, we can find angle 2.

But how? Maybe using triangle properties. For example, in triangle ABD, if we know AD = 2, and AB = d, and BD = ?

From earlier, we had BD = 2 tan(theta). Also, AB = 2 / cos(theta). So AB = 2 / cos(theta), and BD = 2 tan(theta). Let me write BD in terms of AB.

Since tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta), and BD = 2 tan(theta) = 2 sin(theta)/cos(theta). But AB = 2 / cos(theta), so BD = (2 sin(theta))/cos(theta) = (AB * sin(theta)). 

But in a right-angled triangle, sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse = BD/AB. Wait, yes! So BD = AB * sin(theta). Therefore, BD = AB * sin(theta).

But we also have from Pythagoras: AB² = AD² + BD² ⇒ AB² = 4 + (AB * sin(theta))² ⇒ AB² = 4 + AB² sin²(theta) ⇒ AB² (1 - sin²(theta)) = 4 ⇒ AB² cos²(theta) = 4 ⇒ AB cos(theta) = ±2. But since lengths are positive, AB cos(theta) = 2. 

But AB cos(theta) = AD. Wait, because AD is adjacent to angle theta, so cos(theta) = AD / AB ⇒ AB cos(theta) = AD = 2. Which matches the equation. So that doesn't give us new info.

So we're stuck here. How can we find theta? 

Wait, maybe there's something missing. The problem states that angle ADB is a right angle, and AD = 2. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, maybe the triangle is special. Like, if AD = 2 and AB is the diameter, maybe there's a specific ratio. 

Let me consider special cases. Suppose angle BAD is 30 degrees. Then angle ABD is 60 degrees. Then, in that case, AD = 2, AB = 2 / cos(30°) = 2 / (√3/2) = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309. Then BD = AB sin(30°) = (4/√3)(1/2) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.154. 

Alternatively, if angle BAD is 45 degrees, then AB = 2 / cos(45°) = 2 / (√2/2) = 2 * 2/√2 = 2√2. BD = AB sin(45°) = 2√2 * √2/2 = 2. So in this case, BD = 2. So triangle ABD would be an isoceles right-angled triangle with legs AD and BD both equal to 2, and hypotenuse AB = 2√2. 

This seems possible. In this scenario, angle BAD is 45°, and angle ABD is also 45°, making the sum of angle 2 (assuming angle ABD) and angle BAD equal to 90°, which fits the given condition. 

But how do we know which case applies? The problem doesn't specify any other conditions. However, the answer choices include 45° as option B. But let me check if there's another possibility.

Alternatively, if angle BAD is 60°, then angle ABD is 30°, and AB = 2 / cos(60°) = 2 / 0.5 = 4. BD = AB sin(60°) = 4*(√3/2) = 2√3. In this case, AD = 2, BD = 2√3. Then, angle 2 (if it's angle ABD) would be 30°, and angle BAD is 60°, adding to 90°, which also satisfies the condition. So this would give angle 2 as 30°, which is option A. 

So now we have conflicting possibilities. How to decide between these?

Wait, but in the problem, angle 2 is referenced in the equation Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90. If angle 2 is angle ABD, then in the case where angle BAD is 60°, angle ABD is 30°, and their sum is 90°, satisfying the condition. If angle BAD is 45°, then angle ABD is 45°, and angle 2 would be 45°, summing to 90°. So both scenarios are possible. 

So why is there ambiguity? What other condition can we use?

Ah! The problem also says that Line(A,D) is a side of the triangle, and that the length of Line(A,D) is 2. But in both cases, AD = 2. So both scenarios are possible. How can we determine which is correct?

Wait, but maybe there's another property. Since AB is the diameter, and D is on the circle, then the position of D depends on the angle. But without additional information, it's ambiguous. However, the problem includes an image or diagram? Well, since it's a text-based problem, we have to rely solely on the given constraints. 

Wait, the problem also says that the triangle is inscribed in the circle. All triangles inscribed in a circle with AB as diameter are right-angled at D. But that doesn't help. 

Wait, but in the case where angle BAD is 60°, then BD = 2√3. Let's check if that satisfies the chord length. Using the earlier coordinate system where AB is the diameter of length 4 (since AB = 4 in this case), the radius is 2. Then, the distance from A to D is 2. Let's see if that's possible.

Coordinates of A would be (-2, 0), B (2, 0). Let's compute coordinates of D. Earlier, we derived that x = 4/d - d/2. Here, d = AB = 4. So x = 4/4 - 4/2 = 1 - 2 = -1. So x = -1. Then, from x² + y² = (d/2)^2 = 4. So x = -1, so y² = 4 - (-1)^2 = 4 - 1 = 3 ⇒ y = ±√3. So D is at (-1, √3) or (-1, -√3). Distance from A(-2, 0) to D(-1, √3) is sqrt[(-1+2)^2 + (√3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 3] = sqrt(4) = 2. Yes, that works. So in this case, AD is indeed 2. So this scenario is possible.

In the other case, when angle BAD is 45°, AB = 2√2, radius is √2. Then, x = 4/d - d/2 = 4/(2√2) - (2√2)/2 = (2/√2) - √2 = √2 - √2 = 0. So x = 0. Then y² = d²/4 - 4 + 16/d². Wait, earlier we had y² = 4 - 16/d². Let me recalculate. When d = 2√2, then y² = 4 - 16/( (2√2)^2 ) = 4 - 16/(8) = 4 - 2 = 2. So y = ±√2. So D is at (0, √2). Distance from A(-√2, 0) to D(0, √2) is sqrt[(√2)^2 + (√2)^2] = sqrt(2 + 2) = sqrt(4) = 2. Correct. So both scenarios are possible.

So how do we determine which one is correct? The problem must have only one solution. Where am I missing a constraint?

Wait, the problem says that Angle(2) is added to angle BAD to make 90 degrees. So if angle 2 is angle ABD, then in the first case (angle BAD = 60°), angle ABD = 30°, and angle 2 is 30°. In the second case, angle BAD = 45°, angle ABD = 45°, so angle 2 is 45°. Both are possible. But the answer choices include both 30 and 45. How to choose?

Wait, the problem may define angle 2 as a different angle. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

The problem says: "Angle(2)". It might refer to angle ABD, or it might refer to angle ADB, but angle ADB is already the right angle. Or perhaps angle 2 refers to angle at D? No, because angle ADB is already defined as 90 degrees. Or maybe angle at B? 

Wait, looking back at the problem, the last equation is:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90.

Angle(B,A,D) is angle at A, which is angle BAD. So MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) is angle BAD. So MeasureOf(Angle(2)) + angle BAD = 90. So angle 2 is another angle. But which one?

Possibly, angle 2 is angle ABD. Or perhaps angle at B? Or maybe angle at D? But angle at D is already 90 degrees. 

Wait, but angle at D is already fixed as 90°, so if angle 2 was that, then 90 + angle BAD = 90 implies angle BAD = 0, which is impossible. So angle 2 cannot be angle ADB. 

So angle 2 must be either angle ABD or another angle. Wait, perhaps angle 2 refers to angle ABD? If so, then MeasureOf(Angle(2)) is angle ABD, and angle BAD + angle ABD = 90°, which holds true. 

But then, how do we determine whether angle 2 is angle ABD or angle BAD? The problem says "Angle(2)", which might be a label for a specific angle. But since the problem didn't specify, we have to infer based on context. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle at B? But that would be angle ABD. 

But in both scenarios, depending on the angle, angle 2 could be 30 or 45. How to resolve this?

Wait, maybe there's another condition in the problem. Let me check again:

The problem says that LengthOf(Line(A,D)) equals 2. So AD = 2. And that Angle(A,D,B) is a right angle. Also, the triangle is right-angled, and inscribed in the circle. But both scenarios satisfy these conditions. 

Wait, but in the first case, where angle BAD is 60°, angle ABD is 30°, and AD = 2. In the second case, angle BAD is 45°, angle ABD is 45°, and AD = 2. Both are valid. 

But the answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. 

So both 30 and 45 are present. How to decide? 

Wait, perhaps there's a property I missed. Since AB is the diameter, and AD is a chord, the length of AD relates to the angle at A. 

Let me recall that in a circle, the length of a chord is 2R sin(theta), where theta is half the central angle subtended by the chord. 

Let me try applying this. The chord AD has length 2. Let me find the central angle corresponding to chord AD. Let's call the central angle subtended by AD as φ. Then, length AD = 2R sin(φ/2). 

But AB is the diameter, so its length is 2R. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, the central angle subtended by AB is 180°. 

But how does this relate to angle BAD? 

Angle BAD is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BD. Wait, because angle at A subtends arc BD. The measure of angle BAD is half the measure of the arc BD. 

Let me think. In a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the measure of the arc. So angle BAD subtends arc BD, so the measure of angle BAD is half the measure of arc BD. 

Similarly, angle ABD subtends arc AD, so its measure is half the measure of arc AD. 

Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180°. 

Let me denote the arcs:

Arc AB = 180°.

Arc AD = let's say α, and arc BD = β. Since arc AB is 180°, then α + β = 180°. 

Angle BAD is an inscribed angle subtending arc BD, so angle BAD = β/2. 

Angle ABD is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, so angle ABD = α/2. 

Since the triangle is right-angled at D, the angle at D is 90°, which corresponds to the inscribed angle subtending arc AB, which is 180°, so 180°/2 = 90°, which checks out. 

Now, from the earlier relationships, angle BAD + angle ABD = β/2 + α/2 = (α + β)/2 = 180°/2 = 90°, which matches the right angle at D. 

Now, we also have that the length of AD is 2. Using the chord length formula:

AD = 2R sin(α/2) = 2. 

But we also know that AB = 2R, since AB is the diameter. 

Let me denote AB = d = 2R. Then, AD = 2R sin(α/2) = 2. 

So, 2R sin(α/2) = 2 ⇒ R sin(α/2) = 1. 

But α + β = 180°, and β = 180° - α. 

Also, angle BAD = β/2 = (180° - α)/2 = 90° - α/2. 

And angle ABD = α/2. 

Now, we have angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°. Assuming angle 2 is angle ABD (α/2), then:

angle ABD + angle BAD = α/2 + (90° - α/2) = 90°, which matches the given condition. 

Thus, angle 2 is angle ABD, which is α/2. 

But we need to find angle 2, which is α/2. To find α, we need to relate it to AD = 2. 

From earlier, R sin(α/2) = 1. But R = AB/2 = d/2. 

But we also have that angle BAD = 90° - α/2. 

But angle BAD is also related to the triangle. Let me recall that in triangle ABD, angle BAD = 90° - α/2. Also, from the earlier chord length equation, R sin(α/2) = 1. 

But we need another equation to relate R and α. 

Wait, but we also know that AB = d = 2R. 

But how does this help? Let me think. 

Alternatively, since arc AD is α, and the chord AD has length 2 = 2R sin(α/2), we have:

sin(α/2) = 1/R. 

But R is AB/2 = d/2. 

But we also have that in triangle ABD, angle BAD = 90° - α/2. 

But we don't know angle BAD directly. 

Wait, but from the triangle ABD, which is right-angled at D, we have:

AD = 2, AB = d, and BD = 2 tan(angle BAD). 

But angle BAD = 90° - α/2. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines on triangle ABD. 

Wait, in triangle ABD, right-angled at D, the hypotenuse AB = d, and legs AD = 2 and BD. 

Law of Sines: AD / sin(angle ABD) = AB / sin(90°). 

So AD / sin(angle ABD) = AB / 1 ⇒ 2 / sin(angle ABD) = d ⇒ sin(angle ABD) = 2/d. 

But angle ABD is α/2. So sin(α/2) = 2/d. 

But from earlier, we had sin(α/2) = 1/R = 1/(d/2) = 2/d. 

So this confirms consistency. 

So we have sin(α/2) = 2/d. 

But we need to find angle 2, which is α/2. 

But how? Without additional info, it seems underdetermined. 

Wait, but we also have that the length of AD is 2, and AB is the diameter. 

Wait, but if we consider the circle's circumference, or anything else? Not sure. 

Wait, but we can combine the two equations. From above, we have:

sin(α/2) = 2/d, and d = 2R. Also, from the chord length formula, AD = 2 = 2R sin(α/2). Which is the same as 2 = 2R sin(α/2) ⇒ sin(α/2) = 1/R. 

But also from earlier, sin(α/2) = 2/d = 2/(2R) = 1/R. So both give the same equation. 

No new info. 

So it seems we have infinitely many solutions depending on the value of α, as long as sin(α/2) = 1/R. But without knowing R, we can't determine α. 

But how can this be? The problem must have a unique answer. There must be something I'm missing. 

Wait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that in the problem, angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°, and angle 2 is angle ABD. So angle ABD = 90° - angle BAD. But angle BAD = 90° - α/2, and angle ABD = α/2. So this is always true. 

But how does this help us? It seems like this condition is automatically satisfied. 

Wait, this suggests that angle 2 can be any value, as long as it's complement to angle BAD. But since the problem provides specific answer choices, and AD = 2, perhaps there's a standard configuration.

Wait, but if we assume that the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, then AD = 2 could correspond to the shorter leg. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. If AD is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), then the longer leg would be 2√3, and hypotenuse 4. This would give angle BAD as 30°, angle ABD as 60°, and angle 2 (angle ABD) as 60°. But this contradicts the earlier equation where angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°. Wait, in this case, angle 2 would be 60°, and angle BAD is 30°, totaling 90°, which fits. 

Alternatively, if AD is the longer leg, then AD = 2√3, and the shorter leg would be 2, hypotenuse 4. But in our case, AD = 2, so if AD is the shorter leg, then angle BAD is 30°, angle ABD is 60°, and angle 2 would be 60°, which is option C. 

Wait, but earlier, when I considered angle BAD as 60°, angle ABD as 30°, that would mean angle 2 is 30°, which is option A. So depending on which leg is which, we get different answers. 

But how to determine which leg is which? 

In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the smaller angle is shorter. So if angle BAD is 30°, then AD (opposite angle ABD) would be the shorter leg, and BD (opposite angle BAD) would be the longer leg. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In triangle ABD, right-angled at D. Let's label the triangle:

- Right angle at D.
- Angle at A: angle BAD = alpha.
- Angle at B: angle ABD = beta.
- Side AD is opposite angle B (beta).
- Side BD is opposite angle A (alpha).
- Hypotenuse AB.

So if angle BAD (alpha) is smaller than angle ABD (beta), then side BD (opposite alpha) is shorter than AD (opposite beta). 

So if AD = 2 is the longer leg, then angle ABD (beta) is larger than angle BAD (alpha). 

If AD = 2 is the shorter leg, then angle ABD (beta) is smaller than angle BAD (alpha). 

But how do we know which is the case? 

Wait, in the problem, we have that AD = 2. If AD is the shorter leg, then angle ABD (beta) is smaller than angle BAD (alpha). If AD is the longer leg, then angle ABD is larger than angle BAD. 

But since angle 2 is angle ABD (as per earlier assumption), then if angle ABD is larger, angle 2 is larger. 

But the problem gives us answer choices including 30, 45, 60, 90. 

If we assume that AD is the shorter leg (so angle ABD is smaller), then angle ABD is 30°, making angle 2 = 30°, which is option A. 

If AD is the longer leg, then angle ABD is 60°, making angle 2 = 60°, which is option C. 

But how to decide? 

Wait, let's go back to the chord length formula. AD = 2 = 2R sin(alpha/2), where alpha is the central angle subtended by arc AD. 

But we also have that in the triangle, angle ABD = alpha/2. 

Wait, angle ABD is alpha/2, and from the chord length, 2 = 2R sin(alpha/2) ⇒ R sin(alpha/2) = 1. 

But R is the radius, which is AB/2. Also, AB is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle ABD, so AB = sqrt(AD² + BD²) = sqrt(4 + BD²). 

But without knowing BD, it's still difficult. 

Wait, but if we assume that angle ABD is 30°, then alpha/2 = 30° ⇒ alpha = 60°. So the central angle for arc AD is 60°. Then, the length of AD is 2R sin(alpha/2) = 2R sin(30°) = 2R * 0.5 = R. So AD = R. But AD is 2, so R = 2. Hence, the radius is 2, so AB = 4. 

In this case, BD = AB * sin(angle BAD). Angle BAD = 90° - alpha/2 = 90° - 30° = 60°. So BD = 4 * sin(60°) = 4 * (√3/2) = 2√3. 

This is consistent with AD = 2, BD = 2√3, AB = 4. 

Alternatively, if angle ABD is 60°, then alpha/2 = 60° ⇒ alpha = 120°. Then, AD = 2R sin(60°) = 2R * (√3/2) = R√3. Given AD = 2, this means R√3 = 2 ⇒ R = 2/√3. Hence, AB = 2R = 4/√3. 

Then, angle BAD = 90° - alpha/2 = 90° - 60° = 30°. So BD = AB * sin(angle BAD) = (4/√3) * sin(30°) = (4/√3) * 0.5 = 2/√3. 

So in this case, AD = 2, BD = 2/√3, AB = 4/√3. 

Both scenarios are possible. So how do we choose between them? 

But the problem must have a unique answer. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in what angle 2 represents. 

Wait, the problem says: "Angle(2)" and "Angle(B,A,D)" is angle BAD. The equation is Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90. If angle 2 is angle ABD, then in the first case (angle ABD = 30°, angle BAD = 60°), their sum is 90°. In the second case (angle ABD = 60°, angle BAD = 30°), their sum is also 90°. 

But the problem says "Angle(2)" — perhaps it's referring to a specific angle, like the angle at B, which is angle ABD. But without further info, it's ambiguous. 

However, the answer choices include both 30 and 60. But the problem might expect us to recognize that in a right-angled triangle with AD = 2 and AB as diameter, the angle at A (BAD) is 30° or 60°, depending on the triangle. 

Wait, let's think about the circle. If AD is a chord of length 2, and AB is the diameter, then the position of D determines the angle. If AD is closer to A, then angle BAD is smaller, and vice versa. 

But without additional information, it's impossible to determine. 

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated that the triangle is inscribed in the circle. In a circle, the longest possible chord is the diameter. So if AD is a chord of length 2, and AB is the diameter, then AB must be at least 2. But in the first case, AB = 4 (when R = 2), and in the second case, AB = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309, which is greater than 2. 

But both are valid. 

Wait, but the problem says that the length of AD is 2. If AD is a chord of the circle, and AB is the diameter, then the maximum possible length of AD is AB (the diameter). So if AB is longer than 2, AD can be 2. But if AB is exactly 2, then AD can't be longer than 2. 

Wait, but in the first case, when AB = 4, AD = 2 is possible. In the second case, when AB = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309, AD = 2 is possible since 2 < AB. 

So both are valid. 

But since the answer choices are given, and the problem likely expects one answer, perhaps there's a standard assumption. In many problems, if a right-angled triangle is inscribed in a circle with the hypotenuse as the diameter, and one leg is given, it often assumes the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, let's look back at the initial setup. The problem says that the triangle is inscribed in the circle, and AB is the diameter. Also, AD = 2. If we assume that AD is the leg opposite the 30° angle, then angle ABD is 30°, making angle 2 = 30°, option A. Or if AD is the leg opposite the 60° angle, then angle ABD is 60°, making angle 2 = 60°, option C. 

But how to decide? 

Wait, in the problem, it says that the length of AD is 2. If we consider the standard 30-60-90 triangle, where the sides are 1, √3, 2. If AD is the shorter leg (1), then the hypotenuse is 2. But in our case, AD is 2, so scaling factor is 2. So the sides would be 2, 2√3, and 4. In this case, angle ABD would be 60°, and angle BAD would be 30°, making angle 2 = 60°, which is option C. 

Alternatively, if AD is the longer leg (2√3), then the hypotenuse is 4, and the shorter leg is 2. In this case, angle ABD would be 30°, making angle 2 = 30°, option A. 

But which is it? 

Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So if AD is a leg, it can be either shorter or longer than the other leg. 

But if AD is the shorter leg, then the hypotenuse is longer than AD. If AD is the longer leg, the hypotenuse is longer than AD. 

But in both cases, it's possible. 

But since the problem doesn't specify, and the answer choices include both 30 and 60, I'm stuck. 

Wait, but let's revisit the original problem statement. It says: "LengthOf(Line(A,D)),2)" which means AD = 2. Also, it says "Angle(A,D,B)" is a right angle, which is angle at D. 

But in the problem, it also says "Right(Triangle(A,B,D))", confirming it's a right-angled triangle at D. 

Now, in a right-angled triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. But this might not help here. 

Wait, but if we consider the circle, the midpoint of AB is the center of the circle. The distance from the center to D is the radius. 

Let me calculate the distance from the center to D. 

In the coordinate system where A is (-d/2, 0), B is (d/2, 0), and D is (x, y). The center is at (0,0). The distance from D to the center is sqrt(x² + y²) = d/2. 

But we also have from earlier, x = 4/d - d/2. 

So x = (4 - d²/2)/d. 

Then, the distance from D to the center is sqrt(x² + y²) = d/2. 

But we also have from the chord length: AD = 2. 

This doesn't provide new info. 

Wait, but if we use the coordinates, we can find the relationship between d and the coordinates of D. 

But I'm going around in circles here. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of additional constraints, I think the intended answer is 30° or 60°. Given that in most standardized problems, when a right-angled triangle is inscribed in a circle with one leg given, and no other info, it often assumes the 30-60-90 triangle. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, let's consider that in the equation Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) = 90, and if angle 2 is angle ABD, then angle ABD + angle BAD = 90, which is always true for a right-angled triangle. So this equation is always true, which means it doesn't give additional info. 

Wait, but this suggests that angle 2 could be any value, as long as it's the other acute angle. But since the problem provides specific answer choices, and the length of AD is 2, perhaps the only way to determine it is through the triangle's side lengths. 

Let me assume that AD = 2 is the shorter leg, making angle ABD = 60°, and angle BAD = 30°, making angle 2 = 60°. Or if AD = 2 is the longer leg, angle ABD = 30°, angle BAD = 60°, making angle 2 = 30°. 

But how to choose? 

Wait, let's consider the unit circle. If AB is the diameter, and D is a point on the circle, then the coordinates of D can be represented as (cosθ, sinθ) if the circle has radius 1, but scaled appropriately. 

Let me assume the circle has radius R. Then, the coordinates of D can be parameterized as (R cosθ, R sinθ). 

Then, the distance from A to D is 2. Let's assume A is at (-R, 0), B at (R, 0). 

Distance AD is between (-R, 0) and (R cosθ, R sinθ):

AD² = (R cosθ + R)^2 + (R sinθ - 0)^2 = R² (cosθ + 1)^2 + R² sin²θ = R² [(cosθ + 1)^2 + sin²θ] = R² [cos²θ + 2cosθ + 1 + sin²θ] = R² [ (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2cosθ + 1 ] = R² [1 + 2cosθ + 1] = R² (2 + 2cosθ) = 2R²(1 + cosθ). 

This equals 4, since AD = 2. So:

2R²(1 + cosθ) = 4 ⇒ R²(1 + cosθ) = 2. 

But we also know that the central angle corresponding to arc AD is θ, since D is at angle θ from the positive x-axis (assuming standard position). Wait, actually, the angle from A to D would depend on the position of D. Let me clarify.

If A is at (-R, 0), and D is at (R cosθ, R sinθ), then the angle at the center between A and D is the angle between vectors OA and OD. Vector OA is pointing to (-R, 0), which is 180°, and vector OD is at angle θ. So the central angle between A and D is |θ - 180°|. Let's call this angle φ = 180° - θ (assuming θ is measured from the positive x-axis). 

But this is getting too complex. Let me instead use the earlier equation R²(1 + cosθ) = 2. 

But we also know that in the triangle ABD, angle BAD is the angle at A. Let me find this angle in terms of θ. 

Vector AB is from A to B: (2R, 0). Vector AD is from A to D: (R cosθ + R, R sinθ). 

The angle at A is between vectors AB and AD. 

The cosine of angle BAD is the dot product of AB and AD divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Vector AB is (2R, 0). Vector AD is (R(cosθ + 1), R sinθ). 

Dot product: (2R)(R(cosθ + 1)) + 0*(R sinθ) = 2R²(cosθ + 1). 

Magnitude of AB is 2R. Magnitude of AD is 2. 

So cos(angle BAD) = [2R²(cosθ + 1)] / (2R * 2) = [R(cosθ + 1)] / 2. 

But from earlier, R²(1 + cosθ) = 2 ⇒ R(1 + cosθ) = 2/R. 

So cos(angle BAD) = (2/R) / 2 = 1/R. 

Thus, angle BAD = arccos(1/R). 

But we also have that in the triangle, angle BAD + angle ABD = 90°, and angle 2 is angle ABD. 

But angle ABD is the angle at B, which can be found similarly. 

Alternatively, since we have angle BAD = arccos(1/R), and angle 2 = angle ABD = 90° - angle BAD. 

But we need to relate this to the given AD = 2. 

From R²(1 + cosθ) = 2 and angle BAD = arccos(1/R). 

But this seems too abstract. 

Let me assume R = 2. Then, from R²(1 + cosθ) = 2 ⇒ 4(1 + cosθ) = 2 ⇒ 1 + cosθ = 0.5 ⇒ cosθ = -0.5 ⇒ θ = 120° or 240°. 

So D is at angle 120° or 240°. Let's take θ = 120°. Then, coordinates of D are (R cos120°, R sin120°) = (2*(-1/2), 2*(√3/2)) = (-1, √3). 

Distance from A(-2, 0) to D(-1, √3) is sqrt((−1 + 2)^2 + (√3 − 0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2, which matches. 

Angle BAD is arccos(1/R) = arccos(1/2) = 60°. So angle BAD = 60°, angle ABD = 30°, making angle 2 = 30°, which is option A. 

Alternatively, if R = 2/√3, then from R²(1 + cosθ) = 2: (4/3)(1 + cosθ) = 2 ⇒ 1 + cosθ = 3/2 ⇒ cosθ = 1/2 ⇒ θ = 60° or 300°. Take θ = 60°. Coordinates of D are (R cos60°, R sin60°) = ( (2/√3)*(1/2), (2/√3)*(√3/2) ) = (1/√3, 1). 

Distance from A(-2/√3, 0) to D(1/√3, 1) is sqrt[(1/√3 + 2/√3)^2 + (1 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(3/√3)^2 + 1] = sqrt[(√3)^2 + 1] = sqrt(3 + 1) = 2, which is correct. 

Angle BAD = arccos(1/R) = arccos(√3/2) = 30°, so angle BAD = 30°, angle ABD = 60°, making angle 2 = 60°, option C. 

So depending on the value of R, angle 2 can be 30° or 60°. 

But the problem must have a unique answer. Why is this happening? 

Wait, the problem states that the triangle is inscribed in the circle. In both cases, it is. The length AD is 2 in both. 

But the problem also mentions "Angle(2)" and "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D))) equals 90". If angle 2 is angle ABD, then in the first case (R=2), angle 2 is 30°, and in the second case (R=2/√3), angle 2 is 60°. 

But how to choose between these? 

Wait, the problem says that the length of AD is 2. In the first case, where R=2, AD is 2, and in the second case, R=2/√3, AD is also 2. Both are valid. 

But the answer choices include both 30 and 60. However, in the absence of additional information, it's impossible to determine. 

But perhaps the problem assumes that angle 2 is the smaller angle, or the larger one? Or maybe there's a convention. 

Alternatively, let's consider that in the first case, where R=2, the triangle ABD has sides 2, 2√3, and 4. This is a 30-60-90 triangle, with angle BAD = 60°, angle ABD = 30°, and angle 2 = 30°. 

In the second case, where R=2/√3, the triangle has sides 2, 2/√3, and 4/√3, which is also a 30-60-90 triangle, with angle BAD = 30°, angle ABD = 60°, and angle 2 = 60°. 

But both are valid. 

However, in the problem, it says that "LengthOf(Line(A,D)),2)" and "IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B),Triangle(A,B,D))". Since AB is the hypotenuse, and in both cases, AB is longer than AD. 

But in both cases, it's valid. 

Given that, and the presence of both 30 and 60 in the answer choices, I think the problem might expect us to recognize that angle 2 is the angle at B, which is angle ABD. If we assume that AD is the shorter leg, then angle ABD is 60°, but if AD is the longer leg, angle ABD is 30°. 

But without additional information, it's impossible to know. 

However, in many standard problems, if a right-angled triangle is inscribed in a circle with one leg given, and no other info, it's common to assume it's a 30-60-90 triangle. But without knowing which leg is which, it's still ambiguous. 

Wait, let's look back at the problem's statement. It says "Angle(A,D,B)" is a right angle, which is angle at D. It also says "IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B),Triangle(A,B,D))", so AB is the hypotenuse. 

In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So if AD is 2, and AB is the hypotenuse, then AB must be longer than AD. 

In the first case, where R=2, AB = 4 > 2. In the second case, AB = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309 > 2. Both are valid. 

But in the first case, AB = 4, and AD = 2. In the second case, AB ≈ 2.309, and AD = 2. 

But in the second case, AB is slightly longer than AD, while in the first case, it's significantly longer. 

But since the problem gives AD = 2, and AB is the hypotenuse, it's possible that the triangle is not necessarily a 30-60-90 triangle. 

But since the answer choices include both 30 and 60, and the problem is likely designed to have one correct answer, I need to find another clue. 

Wait, let's recall that in a circle, the length of a chord is related to the angle it subtends at the center. If AD is a chord of length 2, and AB is the diameter, then the central angle subtended by AD is 2*arcsin(AD/(2R)). 

But we also know that AB is the diameter, so its central angle is 180°. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since we have two possible scenarios, and the answer choices include both 30 and 60, but the problem is likely expecting one, I'll have to make an educated guess. 

In many standardized tests, if a right-angled triangle is inscribed in a circle with the hypotenuse as the diameter, and one leg is given, it's often assumed to be part of a 30-60-90 triangle. If AD is the shorter leg, then angle at B is 60°, making angle 2 = 60°, option C. If AD is the longer leg, angle at B is 30°, option A. 

But without knowing which leg is which, it's tricky. 

Wait, but in the problem, it says "LengthOf(Line(A,D)),2)" and "IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B)...". Since AB is the hypotenuse, and AD is a leg, then if AD is the shorter leg, it would be part of a 30-60-90 triangle, with the hypotenuse being twice the shorter leg. But in this case, if AD is the shorter leg, then AB should be 2*AD = 4. 

If AD is the longer leg, then the hypotenuse is AB = AD / cos(angle at A). 

But if we assume it's a 30-60-90 triangle, and AD is the shorter leg (2), then AB = 4, and angle at A is 60°, making angle 2 (angle at B) = 30°, which is option A. 

Alternatively, if AD is the longer leg, then AB = 2*AD / √3 = 4/√3, and angle at A is 30°, making angle 2 = 60°, option C. 

But which is more likely? 

In many problems, when a leg is given and the hypotenuse is the diameter, it's common to assume it's the shorter leg. For example, in the classic problem where a right-angled triangle is inscribed in a circle with hypotenuse as diameter, and one leg is given, it's often the shorter leg. 

However, this is just a convention. 

But since both options are present, and the problem is from a test, it's possible that the correct answer is 30° or 60°. 

But how to decide? 

Wait, let's think about the measure of angle 2. If angle 2 is 30°, then the answer is A. If it's 60°, it's C. 

But let's check if there's any other clues in the problem. 

The problem says "Angle(2)" and "Angle(B,A,D)" adds to 90°. If angle 2 is 30°, then angle BAD is 60°, and if angle 2 is 60°, angle BAD is 30°. 

But if we assume that angle 2 is the angle at B (angle ABD), then in the first scenario, angle ABD = 30°, and in the second, 60°. 

But without more info, it's impossible to know. 

Given that, and considering that in a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse as diameter, if one leg is given, it's often the shorter leg, I'll go with angle 2 being 30°, option A. 

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that angle 2 is the angle at A, but that would conflict with the equation. 

Wait, if angle 2 is angle BAD, then the equation would be angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°, implying 2*angle 2 = 90°, so angle 2 = 45°, option B. But this would mean the triangle is isoceles, which would make AD = BD = 2, and AB = 2√2. 

But this is also possible. 

Wait, this is a third possibility! If angle 2 is angle BAD, then the equation becomes angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°, which would mean 2*angle BAD = 90°, so angle BAD = 45°, making angle 2 = 45°, option B. 

This is another possible scenario. 

So now there are three possible answers: 30°, 45°, or 60°, depending on what angle 2 represents. 

But the problem says "Angle(2)" and "Angle(B,A,D)" is angle BAD. So if angle 2 is angle BAD, then the equation is angle 2 + angle BAD = 90°, which would mean angle 2 = 45°, option B. 

This would happen if the triangle is isoceles, with AD = BD = 2, making it a 45-45-90 triangle. 

But in this case, AB = 2√2, and the radius is √2. 

Let's verify if this is possible. 

If AD = 2, and the triangle is isoceles right-angled, then BD = 2, AB = 2√2. 

Using the chord length formula for AD: AD = 2 = 2R sin(α/2), where α is the central angle subtended by AD. 

Here, R = √2. So 2 = 2*√2*sin
