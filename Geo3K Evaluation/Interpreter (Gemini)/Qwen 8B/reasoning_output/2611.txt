====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points Q, P, R, S, T. The lines mentioned are QP, QR, QS, QT. Also, there are some angle relationships given. Let me try to visualize the diagram first.

First, the problem says that QP and QR are opposite rays. That means they form a straight line, right? So, point P and R are on opposite sides of Q, making a straight line through Q. Therefore, the angle between QP and QR would be a straight angle, which is 180 degrees. But wait, the angles mentioned here are ∠SQR and ∠TQR, etc. Maybe I need to consider how these points S and T relate to the line QR.

Next, it mentions that QT bisects ∠SQR. So, angle SQT and angle TQR are parts of ∠SQR. Wait, but since QP and QR are opposite rays, then maybe S is somewhere such that when you connect QS, it creates an angle at Q with QR. Then, QT is the bisector of that angle.

But the problem also gives equations for the measures of those angles. Let me note down the given equations:

- Measure of ∠SQR = 6x + 8
- Measure of ∠TQR = 4x - 14
- Measure of ∠SQT = ?

Also, there's another equation given: measure of ∠SQR equals the sum of measure of ∠SQT and measure of ∠TQR. Which makes sense because QT bisects ∠SQR into two angles: SQT and TQR. So, ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR. 

Wait, but according to the problem statement, there's an equality given as:

MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,R)) = Add(MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(T,Q,R)))

So that confirms that ∠SQR is split into ∠SQT and ∠TQR. Therefore, we can write:

∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR

But we are told that ∠SQR is equal to 6x + 8, and ∠TQR is 4x - 14. However, the problem asks for ∠SQT, so substituting:

6x + 8 = ∠SQT + (4x - 14)

Therefore, solving for ∠SQT:

∠SQT = 6x + 8 - (4x - 14) = 6x + 8 - 4x +14 = 2x + 22

Hmm, but we need more information to find the value of x. Wait, the problem might have given another relationship. Let me check again.

Looking back, there's another equation:

MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,R)) = Add(Mul(6,x),8) → which is same as before.

Another equation: MeasureOf(Angle(T,Q,R)) = Sub(Mul(4,x),14) → same as above.

And MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,T)) = MeasureOf(Angle(T,Q,R)). Wait, that's interesting. So ∠SQT equals ∠TQR?

Wait, the problem states:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,T)),MeasureOf(Angle(T,Q,R)))

So ∠SQT = ∠TQR. Wait, but earlier I thought ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR. If ∠SQT = ∠TQR, then ∠SQR = 2 * ∠TQR. 

Let me re-express that. Let me denote:

Let’s call ∠SQT = y, and ∠TQR = z. Given that QT bisects ∠SQR, so y = z. And ∠SQR = y + z = 2y. 

But according to the problem, ∠SQR = 6x + 8, and ∠TQR = 4x -14. Since ∠TQR = z = 4x -14, and since y = z, then ∠SQT = 4x -14. But also, ∠SQR = 2*(4x -14) = 8x -28. But ∠SQR is also given as 6x +8. Therefore:

8x -28 = 6x +8  
Subtract 6x both sides: 2x -28 =8  
Add 28 to both sides: 2x=36  
Divide by 2: x=18

Then, substitute x=18 into ∠SQT = 4x -14. 

Calculating that: 4*18 =72; 72 -14=58. So ∠SQT would be 58 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, option D is 58. However, let me check again my reasoning because sometimes mistakes happen.

Wait, hold on. Earlier, I considered that ∠SQT equals ∠TQR because of the given equality. Let me verify that part again. 

The problem states:

Angle(S,Q,T) equals Angle(T,Q,R). So ∠SQT equals ∠TQR. 

Yes, that's correct. Because ∠SQT is the angle between SQ and TQ, and ∠TQR is between TQ and RQ. Since QT is the bisector, then those two angles should be equal. Hence, ∠SQT = ∠TQR. 

Thus, using that, we get ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR = 2∠TQR. 

But ∠SQR is given as 6x+8, and ∠TQR is given as 4x-14. Therefore:

6x +8 = 2*(4x -14)  
Expanding RHS: 8x -28  
Set equal: 6x +8 =8x -28  
Bring variables to left and constants to right: 8 - (-28) =8x -6x  
Which is 8 +28 =2x → 36=2x → x=18. 

Then, ∠SQT = ∠TQR =4x-14. Plugging x=18: 4*18=72, minus14 is 58. So ∠SQT=58°, which is option D. 

But let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For example, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that ∠SQT equals ∠TQR. Let me confirm that. 

Since QT bisects ∠SQR, then yes, the bisector divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠SQT and ∠TQR are equal. Thus, their measures are equal. Therefore, that approach is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again the problem statement. 

The problem says: "Angle(S,Q,T)" equals "Angle(T,Q,R)". So ∠SQT equals ∠TQR. Yes. Therefore, my previous steps are correct. 

So, solving gives x=18, leading to ∠SQT=58°, which is option D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another constraint. For instance, angles can't be negative. Let me check if with x=18, the angles make sense. 

For ∠TQR =4x -14, plugging x=18: 4*18=72-14=58. Positive. 

∠SQR=6x+8=6*18+8=108+8=116. 

Check if ∠SQR equals 2*∠TQR: 2*58=116. Correct. 

So everything checks out. Therefore, the answer should be D. 

But wait, the answer choices include D as 58. So the answer is D. 

But let me check once more if there's a different interpretation. Suppose that the angle bisector splits ∠SQR into ∠SQT and ∠TQR. But maybe the problem has a typo, but according to the given data, that seems correct. 

Another possible error: Did I mix up the angles? Like, is ∠SQT equal to ∠TQR? Let me think about the notation. 

The angle ∠SQT is formed by points S-Q-T, so vertex at Q, with segments QS and QT. 

The angle ∠TQR is formed by points T-Q-R, vertex at Q, segments QT and QR. 

Since QT is the bisector of ∠SQR, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR are adjacent angles forming ∠SQR. So yes, they are equal. 

Hence, the calculation is correct. So the answer is D. 

But wait, the initial problem had some other constraints. Let me check again the original problem's constraints. 

Original problem's constraints included:

PointLiesOnLine(Q,Line(P,R)): So Q lies on PR? Wait, Line(Q,P) and Line(Q,R) – but if Q is connected to P and R, and PR is a line, then Q is a point not on PR unless P, Q, R are colinear. But the problem says that QP and QR are opposite rays. So Q is the common endpoint of two opposite rays, meaning that P and R are on a straight line through Q, with Q between P and R. Therefore, PR is a straight line passing through Q. 

But the PointLiesOnLine(Q,Line(P,R)) is redundant because Q is on line PR. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(P,Line(P,R)) is obvious. 

Other constraints may not affect the angle relations. 

So, the rest of the problem is okay. 

Therefore, conclusion remains that the measure of ∠SQT is 58°, so answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle SQT $, we start by analyzing the given relationships and applying geometric principles systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We're told that:

- $ \vec{QP} $ and $ \vec{QR} $ are **opposite rays**, which implies that $ \angle PQR $ is a **straight angle** (i.e., $ 180^\circ $).
- $ \vec{QT} $ **bisects** $ \angle SQR $. This means that:
  $$
  \angle SQT = \angle TQR
  $$

This is crucial, as it allows us to express the total angle $ \angle SQR $ as the sum of its two equal parts:
$$
\angle SQR = \angle SQT + \angle TQR = 2 \cdot \angle SQT
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use Given Equations**

From the problem, we are given the following expressions for the angle measures:

- $ \angle SQR = 6x + 8 $
- $ \angle TQR = 4x - 14 $

Given that $ \angle SQT = \angle TQR $, we substitute into the expression for $ \angle SQR $:

$$
6x + 8 = 2(4x - 14)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Expand and simplify:

$$
6x + 8 = 8x - 28
$$

$$
8 + 28 = 8x - 6x
$$

$$
36 = 2x
$$

$$
x = 18
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ \angle SQT $**

Now that we know $ x = 18 $, substitute into the expression for $ \angle TQR $ (which is equal to $ \angle SQT $):

$$
\angle TQR = 4x - 14 = 4(18) - 14 = 72 - 14 = 58
$$

Thus,

$$
m\angle SQT = 58^\circ
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$

Final Answer: D
