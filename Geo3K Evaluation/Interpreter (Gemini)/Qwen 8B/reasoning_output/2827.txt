====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this rhombus problem. First, I need to recall the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal, opposite angles are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the angles they connect.

The question gives some specific information. Let me parse through the constraints again. The problem mentions that in rhombus ABCD, the measure of angle DAB is 2 (wait, that seems very small—maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's degrees? Wait, no, maybe the original problem had different numbers but here it's written as 2. Wait, looking back at the user's input:

Wait, the question says: "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m∠ADB." Hmm, perhaps there was a formatting issue. Let me check again.

Original question: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠ D A B = 2, m ∠ A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠ A D B."

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the translation. Maybe it should be m∠DAB = 2x or something else? But as per the given text, it says m∠DAB = 2, then m∠ADC and CB = 6. That might be a misformatting. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say that m∠DAB is 2 times something, or maybe there's a missing part. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had numerical values that got messed up during transcription.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that m∠DAB is 2 degrees, which seems extremely small for a rhombus, but maybe it's a hypothetical scenario. However, given that CB = 6, which is a side length. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, so AB=BC=CD=DA=6.

But wait, in the constraints given earlier, there are several equals statements. For example, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)), 6). So CB is 6. Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), etc., meaning all sides are equal to 6. So each side is 6 units long.

Now, the problem asks for m∠ADB. Let me visualize the rhombus. Let me draw it mentally. Let me label the rhombus ABCD, with points A, B, C, D in order. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.

Given that angle DAB is 2. Wait, angle DAB is at vertex A between DA and AB. If that's 2 degrees, then since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. Because adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ABC = 180°, etc.

But if angle DAB is 2°, then angle ABC would be 178°, angle BCD would be 2°, and angle ADC would be 178°, but that seems highly unusual. However, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the original problem had different numbers, like angle DAB = 60°, but due to formatting, it became 2. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using radians instead of degrees? But usually, angles in such problems are in degrees unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.

The user wrote:

"In rhombus A B C D, m ∠ D A B = 2, m ∠ A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠ A D B."

Hmm, maybe there's a missing symbol or part. For instance, maybe it's supposed to be "m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6", but the way it's written is confusing. Alternatively, maybe "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC = ?, and CB = 6". But the way it's phrased is unclear.

Wait, the original problem may have been mistyped. Let me think about standard rhombus problems. Typically, you're given some angles and sides and asked to find others. Given that CB is 6, which is a side, so all sides are 6. Also, the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Moreover, the diagonals bisect the angles.

Let me consider that maybe the angle measures were mistyped. Suppose that instead of "m∠DAB = 2", it's supposed to be "m∠DAB = 60°", which is common in rhombus problems. Then, with that, we can proceed. But since the user has written it as 2, I have to work with that. However, given that if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ADC would be supplementary to angle DAB, making it 178 degrees. But then, how does that relate to finding angle ADB?

Wait, angle ADB is the angle at vertex D between AD and DB. Let me think about triangle ADB. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So diagonal AC and BD intersect at E, the midpoint. Therefore, AE = EC, BE = ED, and AC ⊥ BD.

So, in triangle AED, which is a right triangle because diagonals intersect at right angles. Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.

Assume point A is at (0, 0). Since all sides are 6 units. Let me suppose that the rhombus is placed such that diagonal AC is horizontal and BD is vertical. Wait, but depending on the angles. Alternatively, perhaps assigning coordinates based on angles.

Alternatively, use trigonometry. Let me denote angle DAB as θ. Then, the diagonals split the angles into halves. So, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle BAD is θ, so half of that is θ/2. Similarly, the diagonals intersect at E, forming four right triangles.

But in a rhombus, the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the angles. The formula for the diagonals in terms of the side length and angles: if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then:

d1 = 2 * a * sin(theta/2)

and 

d2 = 2 * a * cos(theta/2)

Wait, actually, the formulas depend on the angles. Let me recall: in a rhombus with side length 'a' and angles θ and 180-θ, the lengths of the diagonals p and q can be found via:

p = 2a sin(θ/2)

q = 2a cos(θ/2)

Wait, no. Wait, when you split the rhombus into two congruent triangles by a diagonal, each triangle has sides a, a, and p. The angle between the sides of length a is θ. Using the law of cosines:

p² = a² + a² - 2a² cos θ => p² = 2a²(1 - cos θ) => p = 2a sin(θ/2), since 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2).

Similarly, the other diagonal q splits the angle into 180 - θ, so:

q² = 2a²(1 - cos(180 - θ)) = 2a²(1 + cos θ) => q = 2a cos(θ/2)

Therefore, the diagonals are p = 2a sin(θ/2) and q = 2a cos(θ/2).

But in our case, we have angle DAB = θ, which is given as 2 degrees. Wait, but if θ is 2 degrees, then the diagonals would be very small. But let's proceed.

But the problem states that CB = 6. Since all sides are equal, each side is 6. So a = 6.

Then, the diagonals are p = 2*6*sin(θ/2) = 12 sin(θ/2), and q = 12 cos(θ/2).

However, also, the diagonals intersect at E, and since they bisect each other, the segments of the diagonals are p/2 and q/2.

But we might need more information to find the relationship between the diagonals. However, the problem asks for the measure of angle ADB.

Let me think about triangle ADB. Points A, D, B. Wait, angle at D, which is angle ADB. Let me see. In triangle ADB, we can find the angles. Let me note that in the rhombus, AD = 6, AB = 6, and BD is one of the diagonals. So triangle ABD has sides AD = 6, AB = 6, and BD = q (the longer or shorter diagonal depending on the angle). Wait, angle at D is angle ADB.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Let me assume that the rhombus is positioned such that diagonal AC is along the x-axis, and BD is along the y-axis. The intersection point E is the origin? No, since diagonals bisect each other. Let me suppose that E is the origin. Then, since diagonals intersect at E, which is the midpoint.

If the diagonals are AC and BD, then coordinates:

Point A is (-p/2, 0), point C is (p/2, 0). Point B is (0, q/2), point D is (0, -q/2). Wait, no. Wait, if diagonals are AC and BD, then coordinates:

Let me define diagonals AC and BD intersecting at E. So, assuming E is the origin (0,0). Then, since diagonals bisect each other, coordinates:

Point A: (-p/2, 0)

Point C: (p/2, 0)

Point B: (0, q/2)

Point D: (0, -q/2)

Wait, but then the sides AB, BC, CD, DA can be computed. Let me compute vector AB: from A(-p/2, 0) to B(0, q/2): displacement (p/2, q/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(p² + q²). But in reality, the side length is 6, so:

sqrt(p² + q²)/2 = 6 → sqrt(p² + q²) = 12 → p² + q² = 144.

But from earlier, p = 12 sin(θ/2) and q = 12 cos(θ/2). Therefore, p² + q² = 144 sin²(θ/2) + 144 cos²(θ/2) = 144(sin² + cos²) = 144. Which matches. So that checks out.

Now, angle ADB is the angle at point D between points A, D, B. Let me find vectors DA and DB.

Point D is at (0, -q/2). Vector DA goes from D to A: A - D = (-p/2 - 0, 0 - (-q/2)) = (-p/2, q/2). Vector DB goes from D to B: B - D = (0 - 0, q/2 - (-q/2)) = (0, q).

To find angle between DA and DB at point D, which is angle ADB. We can use the dot product formula:

cos(angle) = (DA • DB) / (|DA| |DB| )

Compute DA • DB = (-p/2)(0) + (q/2)(q) = 0 + q²/2 = q²/2.

|DA| is the magnitude of DA. DA vector is (-p/2, q/2), so its magnitude squared is (p²/4 + q²/4) = (p² + q²)/4 = 144/4 = 36. Hence |DA| = 6, which makes sense since DA is a side of the rhombus.

|DB| is the magnitude of DB vector, which is (0, q), so |DB| = q.

Thus,

cos(angle ADB) = (q²/2) / (6 * q) ) = q/(12).

Therefore, angle ADB = arccos(q/12).

But q is 12 cos(θ/2), so substituting:

q = 12 cos(θ/2)

Hence, cos(angle ADB) = [12 cos(θ/2)] / 12 = cos(θ/2)

Thus, angle ADB = arccos(cos(θ/2)) = θ/2.

Wait, but θ is angle DAB. So angle ADB is equal to θ/2?

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, since in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, diagonal BD bisects angle ABC and angle ADC. Wait, but angle ADB is not necessarily directly related to the angle DAB unless considering certain triangles.

But according to the calculation above, angle ADB = θ/2, where θ is angle DAB. But if that's the case, then if angle DAB is θ, then angle ADB is θ/2.

But in the problem statement, angle DAB is given as 2, so angle ADB would be 1 degree. But none of the answer choices include 1 degree. This suggests that there's either a miscalculation or a misinterpretation of the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle DAB is not θ but something else. Wait, let me go back to the problem statement.

The user wrote: "In rhombus A B C D, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ADB."

Wait, maybe there's confusion in the problem statement. Perhaps "m∠ADC and C B = 6" means that m∠ADC = 6 and CB = 6? Or maybe there's a missing operator. Like, maybe it's supposed to be "m∠ADC = 6 and CB = 6"? If that's the case, then angle ADC is 6 degrees, and CB is 6 units.

But that still leaves angle DAB = 2 degrees, which seems odd. However, proceeding with that assumption, if angle DAB = 2 degrees, then angle ADC is supplementary to it, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. Wait, no: in a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ABC = 180°, angle ABC + angle BCD = 180°, etc. Also, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB = angle BCD, and angle ABC = angle ADC.

If angle DAB is 2°, then angle ABC = 178°, angle BCD = 2°, angle ADC = 178°. But if angle ADC is given as 6°, then there's inconsistency. So this suggests that my initial interpretation is wrong.

Perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Let me look again. The original problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS: ... Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)), 6)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C)))... Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), LengthOf(Line(C,D)))... Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,A)))... Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 6)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 6)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)), 6)... Parallel(...)... Perpendicular(...)..." So all sides are equal to 6. Thus, CB is 6, which is consistent.

Then, the question: "In rhombus A B C D, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ADB."

Maybe it's supposed to say m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6. Or perhaps m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC = ? and CB = 6. But without clear info, it's hard to tell. However, the answer choices suggest that the answer is likely a common angle like 60°, 90°, etc.

Alternatively, maybe there was a formatting error in the problem. For example, maybe the original problem said m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = ?, and CB = 6. Let me assume that the angle DAB is 60°, which is a common value. Then, proceeding with that.

Assuming angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADC is supplementary to it, so 120°, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. Wait, no: angle DAB and angle ADC are opposite angles, so they are equal? No, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. Adjacent angles are supplementary.

Wait, angle DAB and angle ADC are adjacent? Let me visualize the rhombus. Points A, B, C, D in order. So angle at A (DAB) and angle at D (ADC) are adjacent? No. At point A, angle DAB; at point D, angle ADC. These are opposite angles? No, they are opposite. Because in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB = angle BCD, and angle ABC = angle ADC.

So if angle DAB is θ, then angle ADC = angle ABC = 180° - θ.

Wait, but if that's the case, and if angle ADC is given as something, then we can find θ.

But going back to the problem statement, the original question says "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ADB."

This is still ambiguous. Maybe "m∠DAB = 2" is a typo, and it should be "m∠DAB = 60°", and "m∠ADC = ?" and CB = 6. Assuming that, let's proceed.

Let me assume that the angle DAB is 60°, and CB = 6. Then, since all sides are 6, and angle DAB is 60°, the rhombus is made up of two equilateral triangles. Wait, if angle DAB is 60°, then the diagonals would form specific lengths.

But let's calculate angle ADB. Earlier, we derived that angle ADB = θ/2, where θ is angle DAB. So if θ is 60°, then angle ADB is 30°, which is option A. But the answer choices include 30 as option A. However, if the angle DAB was 60°, then this would fit.

Alternatively, if the given angle DAB is 2°, leading to angle ADB being 1°, which isn't among the choices, suggesting that the original problem likely had angle DAB as 60°, and there was a formatting error.

Another possibility is that the problem says "m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6", and we need to find x. But without knowing, it's challenging.

Alternatively, let me consider the given constraints in the problem. There are many conditions given, including perpendicular diagonals, bisecting angles, etc. Let me focus on those.

From the given constraints:

- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.
- Diagonals bisect each other.
- Diagonals bisect the angles.
- So, in particular, diagonal BD bisects angle ABC and angle ADC.
- Also, diagonal AC bisects angles DAB and DCB.

Given that, let's consider angle ADB. This is the angle at D between AD and DB. Since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, which is equal to angle ABC.

Let me denote angle DAB as α. Then, since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle ADC = 180° - α.

Since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, it divides it into two equal parts. Each part is (180° - α)/2.

Now, in triangle ADB, we have angle at D is angle ADB, which is the same as one of these bisected angles? Wait, no. Let me think.

At point D, angle ADC is formed by sides DC and DA. The diagonal DB splits this angle into two equal parts. So angle ADC is split into two angles: angle ADB and angle CDB, each equal to (180° - α)/2.

Wait, but angle ADB is one of those two angles. So angle ADB = (180° - α)/2.

But we also know that in a rhombus, the sum of angles around point D is 360°, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, using the fact that the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle ADB is half of angle ADC. So if angle ADC is 180° - α, then angle ADB is (180° - α)/2.

But we also know from the problem statement that m∠DAB = 2. Assuming that α = 2°, then angle ADB would be (180 - 2)/2 = 178/2 = 89°, which is not among the choices. Still problematic.

But if the problem had angle DAB = 60°, then angle ADB = (180 - 60)/2 = 60°, which would make answer B. But the answer choices include 60 as option B.

Alternatively, if the given angle DAB is 120°, then angle ADB would be (180 - 120)/2 = 30°, which is option A.

But how do we determine which angle is given?

Looking back at the problem statement, the user mentioned that in the constraints, there's a line: "SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), 180)". Wait, this might indicate that angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°, which is true for a rhombus, as consecutive angles are supplementary.

But in the problem statement, it says "SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), 180)" — this could mean that the sum of angle DAB and angle ADC is 180°, which is always true. So that's just reinforcing the property of rhombus.

Additionally, there's another condition: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))))". So angle ADB is half of angle ADC.

So, if we let angle ADC = x, then angle ADB = x/2.

Also, since angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°, and angle DAB is given as 2, then 2 + x = 180°, so x = 178°, hence angle ADB = 178/2 = 89°, which again isn't among the choices.

But this suggests that the given angle DAB = 2 is incorrect, possibly a typo. Let me think about the possible scenarios where the answer choices are present.

Suppose the problem meant that angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADC = 120°, and angle ADB = 60°, which would be option B. Or if angle DAB is 120°, then angle ADC = 60°, and angle ADB = 30°, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the problem had angle ADC = 60°, then angle DAB = 120°, and angle ADB = 30°, which would be option A.

But without knowing the exact value, it's hard to tell. However, since the answer choices include 30, 60, 90, 120, and given that in a rhombus, common angles are often multiples of 30 or 60 degrees, it's likely that the intended problem had angle DAB as 120°, making angle ADB = 30°, which is option A.

Alternatively, if angle ADC is 60°, then angle DAB = 120°, and angle ADB = 30°, matching option A.

But why would the problem mention CB = 6? Well, since all sides are 6, it confirms that it's a rhombus with side length 6, but doesn't affect the angle calculation directly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the diagonals and the angles. For example, if the diagonals are perpendicular, and their lengths are related to the angles.

Let me consider that the diagonals are perpendicular. So in a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2. Also, the area can be expressed as a^2 sinθ, where θ is one of the angles.

Given that all sides are 6, a = 6. So area = 36 sinθ.

Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, d1^2 + d2^2 = 4a^2 (from Pythagorean theorem applied to the diagonals). Wait, no: in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy d1^2 + d2^2 = 4a^2. Let me confirm:

Each side is a, and the diagonals are d1 and d2. From earlier, we have d1 = 2a sin(θ/2), d2 = 2a cos(θ/2). So d1^2 + d2^2 = 4a² sin²(θ/2) + 4a² cos²(θ/2) = 4a² (sin² + cos²) = 4a². Hence yes, d1² + d2² = 4a².

But without knowing the actual lengths of the diagonals, this might not help directly.

However, if we assume that the problem has a typo and angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADB = 30°, which is option A. Or if angle DAB is 120°, then angle ADB = 30°, which is also option A. Both scenarios give option A. But if angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADB = 30°, which is option A. But if the problem had angle DAB as 60°, then the answer would be 30°, which is option A.

But why would the problem mention CB = 6? It's just confirming the side length, which is already implied by the equality of all sides.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that angle ADB is half of angle ADC, as per the constraint "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))))". So angle ADB = ½ angle ADC.

And since angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°, if we let angle DAB = 2x, then angle ADC = 180° - 2x. Hence, angle ADB = (180° - 2x)/2 = 90° - x.

But we also know from the problem that angle DAB = 2. If this is 2x, then x = 1°, making angle ADB = 90° - 1° = 89°, which again isn't an option. But if angle DAB is 2x, and x is something else...

Wait, maybe the problem states that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = x, but the user wrote it as "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6". It's possible that there was a formatting error, and it should be "m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6". In that case, solving 2x + x = 180° → x = 60°, so angle DAB = 120°, angle ADC = 60°, and angle ADB = 60°/2 = 30°, which is option A.

This fits with the answer choices. Hence, it's likely that the original problem had angle DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = x, leading to x = 60°, and thus angle ADB = 30°, which is option A.

Therefore, despite the ambiguity in the problem statement, the most plausible answer is A. 30°.
