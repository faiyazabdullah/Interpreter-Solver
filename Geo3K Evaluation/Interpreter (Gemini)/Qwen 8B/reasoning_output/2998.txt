====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find y here. So we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, it says that angle at point A (angle BAC) is a right angle. Wait, no—wait, the Angle(B,A,C) is a right angle. So that would mean angle at point A between points B and C. Wait, angle BAC is the angle at point A, so yes, that's the right angle. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. Then, they mention that line AB has length 14, line AC has length x, and line BC has length y. Also, angle at C, which is angle ACB, measures 60 degrees. Wait, the measure of angle (A,C,B)—so angle at C between points A and B. So angle ACB is 60 degrees.

So we have a right-angled triangle at A, with angle at C being 60 degrees. That means the angles in the triangle are 90°, 60°, and the third angle at B should be 30°, since angles add up to 180. Because 90 + 60 = 150, so remaining is 30°. 

Now, in such a triangle, the sides can be related using trigonometric ratios. Since we know one angle (60°) and some side lengths, maybe we can use sine, cosine, or tangent. Let me recall the definitions.

In a right-angled triangle, for an angle θ:

Opposite side / Hypotenuse = sinθ

Adjacent side / Hypotenuse = cosθ

Opposite / Adjacent = tanθ

But first, I need to identify which sides correspond to which angles. Let's clarify:

The right angle is at A. So the hypotenuse is BC, because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Therefore, BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but the problem states that line BC is the hypotenuse. Yes, according to the constraint: IsHypotenuseOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). So BC is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse is BC, which has length y. The legs are AB and AC, with AB = 14, AC = x. But angle at C is 60°, so angle ACB is 60°, which is adjacent to side AC and opposite to side AB?

Wait, let me think again. Let's label the triangle properly.

Let me sketch mentally:

Right-angled at A. So vertices A, B, C with right angle at A. So sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at C is 60°, so angle ACB = 60°. So angle at C is between sides CB and CA. So in terms of the triangle, angle at C is between leg AC and hypotenuse BC.

Therefore, considering angle at C (which is 60°), the sides relative to this angle:

Opposite side to angle C is AB (since angle at C, opposite side is AB).

Adjacent side to angle C is AC.

Hypotenuse is BC.

So for angle C (60°):

sin(60°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AB / BC

cos(60°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = AC / BC

tan(60°) = opposite / adjacent = AB / AC

Given that AB = 14, so let's write equations based on these.

From the problem statement, they also give equalities involving sin(60°), cos(60°), tan(60°). For example:

Equals(SinOf(60), Div(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C)))) → Sin(60°) = AB / BC → which matches our previous conclusion.

Similarly, Cos(60°) = AC / BC → equals AC divided by BC.

And Tan(60°) = AB / AC.

So given that, we can set up equations.

We need to find y, which is BC.

So let me note down:

AB = 14

BC = y

AC = x

We need to find y.

Also, angle at C is 60°, so:

sin(60°) = AB / BC → √3/2 = 14 / y → solving for y gives y = 14 * 2 / √3 = 28 / √3. Rationalizing denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √3, gives (28√3)/3. Which would make option B? Wait, looking at the answer choices:

A. 14√3 / 3 ≈ 8.08...

B. 28√3 / 3 ≈ 16.16...

C. 14√3 ≈ 24.25...

D. 28.

But wait, my calculation gives 28/√3, which rationalized is 28√3 / 3, which is option B. However, let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me verify using another approach.

Since angle at C is 60°, then in triangle ABC, which is right-angled at A, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B is 30°, as mentioned earlier. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, opposite 60° is the longer leg, and hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

Wait, but here, which angle is which?

In our case, angle at C is 60°, angle at B is 30°, angle at A is 90°. So:

- Side opposite 30° (angle at B) is AC. Because angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite is AC.

- Side opposite 60° (angle at C) is AB. Because angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite is AB.

- Hypotenuse BC is opposite the right angle at A.

So in standard 30-60-90 ratios:

Shorter leg (opposite 30°): AC = ?

Longer leg (opposite 60°): AB = 14

Hypotenuse: BC = ?

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where:

shorter leg (opposite 30°) = 1

longer leg (opposite 60°) = √3

hypotenuse = 2

So in our case, the longer leg is AB = 14, which corresponds to √3 in the ratio. Therefore:

Let’s denote the shorter leg (AC) as x, longer leg (AB) as 14, hypotenuse BC as y.

Then, from the ratio:

longer leg / shorter leg = √3 → 14 / x = √3 → x = 14 / √3

And hypotenuse = 2 * shorter leg → y = 2x = 2*(14 / √3) = 28 / √3, which again rationalizes to 28√3 / 3. So same as before. Hence, y = 28√3 / 3, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check using the trigonometric relations again. From the angle at C (60°):

sin(60°) = AB / BC → √3/2 = 14 / y → y = 14 * 2 / √3 = 28 / √3 = 28√3 / 3. Same result.

Alternatively, using the cosine of 60°, which is adjacent over hypotenuse. At angle C, adjacent side is AC, hypotenuse is BC.

cos(60°) = AC / BC → 0.5 = x / y → x = y / 2.

But we also have from Pythagoras theorem: AB² + AC² = BC² → 14² + x² = y².

Substituting x = y/2 into this equation:

14² + (y/2)^2 = y^2 → 196 + y²/4 = y² → 196 = y² - y²/4 = (3/4)y² → y² = 196 * 4 / 3 → y² = 784 / 3 → y = sqrt(784/3) = 28 / √3 = 28√3 / 3. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.

Thus, the value of y is 28√3 / 3, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me check once more if there's any chance I mixed up the sides. For instance, could angle at C being 60° relate to different sides?

Another way: since angle at C is 60°, then tan(angle C) = opposite / adjacent. Opposite to angle C is AB (length 14), adjacent is AC (length x). So tan(60°) = AB / AC → √3 = 14 / x → x = 14 / √3. Then, using Pythagoras: BC² = AB² + AC² → y² = 14² + (14 / √3)^2 → compute that:

14² = 196

(14 / √3)^2 = 196 / 3

Total y² = 196 + 196 / 3 = (588 + 196) / 3 = 784 / 3 → y = √(784/3) = 28 / √3 = 28√3 / 3. Same result. So definitely option B.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A. 14√3 / 3 ≈ 8.08...

B. 28√3 / 3 ≈ 16.16...

C. 14√3 ≈ 24.25...

D. 28.

So 28√3 / 3 is approximately 16.16, which is option B. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, which represents the length of the hypotenuse $ BC $ in the right triangle $ \triangle ABC $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

- Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is **right-angled** at vertex $ A $, i.e., $ \angle BAC = 90^\circ $.
- $ \angle ACB = 60^\circ $, making $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $, since the sum of angles in a triangle is $ 180^\circ $.
- This forms a classic **30–60–90 triangle**, where the sides are in the fixed ratio:
  
  $$
  \text{Shortest leg} : \text{Longest leg} : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Assign Known Values**

- Given: $ AB = 14 $
- Since $ \angle ACB = 60^\circ $, the side **opposite** this angle is $ AB $, which makes it the **longer leg**.
- Thus, in the 30–60–90 triangle:
  $$
  \text{Longer leg} = 14 \Rightarrow \text{Ratio Factor} = \frac{14}{\sqrt{3}}
  $$
- The **hypotenuse** ($ BC $) is twice the shorter leg:
  $$
  BC = 2 \times (\text{Shorter Leg}) = 2 \times \left(\frac{14}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{28}{\sqrt{3}}
  $$
- Rationalizing the denominator:
  $$
  BC = \frac{28\sqrt{3}}{3}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Confirm Using Trigonometry**

Using the definition of sine in a right triangle:
$$
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{BC}
$$
$$
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad AB = 14, \quad \text{so:}
$$
$$
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{14}{y} \Rightarrow y = \frac{14 \cdot 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{28}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{28\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

This confirms the result.

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of the hypotenuse $ BC $, denoted as $ y $, is:

$$
y = \boxed{\frac{28\sqrt{3}}{3}}
$$

---

### **Final Answer: B**  
$$
\boxed{B}
$$
