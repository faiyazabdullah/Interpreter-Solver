MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem is about an equilateral triangle RST. So first, I remember that in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. That means RS, ST, and RT should all have the same length. But wait, the problem gives expressions for each side in terms of x. Let me note them down:

RS = x + 9  
ST = 2x  
RT = 3x - 9  

Since it's an equilateral triangle, all these lengths must be equal. So I need to set up equations where each pair of these expressions equals each other.

First, maybe set RS equal to ST because they're both sides of the triangle. So:

x + 9 = 2x  
Subtracting x from both sides gives 9 = x. Wait, so x would be 9? But then I need to check if this value also satisfies the third side RT.

Let me calculate RT when x=9. RT is 3x -9. Plugging in 9: 3*9 -9 = 27 -9 = 18. Now, RS when x=9 is 9+9=18. And ST is 2*9=18. Oh, so all three sides would be 18. That seems to work. So x=9?

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 9. But let me double-check because sometimes there might be a mistake here. Let me go through the steps again.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Since all sides must be equal, we can set RS = RT as well. Let me try that equation too.

So RS = RT:  
x + 9 = 3x -9  
Subtract x from both sides: 9 = 2x -9  
Add 9 to both sides: 18 = 2x  
Divide by 2: x = 9. Same result. 

Hmm, so either way, whether I equate RS and ST or RS and RT, I get x=9. Then checking ST and RT: ST is 2x which would be 18, and RT is 3x-9 which is also 18. So yes, all sides equal. Therefore, x=9. Which corresponds to answer choice C. 

Wait, but hold on. The problem mentions that the triangle is equilateral, so all sides must be equal. However, the initial problem statement says that the user has given some constraints like Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,T))) etc. So perhaps those are redundant since the triangle is already equilateral. But according to the problem, the user is given that the triangle is equilateral, so all sides must be equal. Hence, the equations derived from setting the sides equal should give the same x. 

Therefore, solving x +9 = 2x gives x=9, and substituting back into all sides confirms they are equal. So the answer should be C. But let me check once more for errors. Maybe I made a mistake in algebra?

Original equations:

RS = x +9  
ST = 2x  
RT = 3x -9  

Set RS = ST:  
x +9 = 2x â†’ 9 = x. Correct. Then RT with x=9: 3*9 -9 = 18. RS is 18, ST is 18. All equal. So yes, x=9. 

But why does the problem include the other equalities? Like Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,T))), etc. Wait, maybe the problem is trying to trick us? For example, if someone thought that only two sides are equal, but since it's equilateral, all three must be equal. So even though the problem includes those equality constraints, they are all satisfied when x=9. 

So the correct answer is C, 9. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A.3, B.6, C.9, D.12. So answer C is 9. Therefore, the correct choice is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ in the given equilateral triangle $ \triangle RST $, we start by analyzing the relationships between its side lengths:

- Side $ RS = x + 9 $
- Side $ ST = 2x $
- Side $ RT = 3x - 9 $

---

### Step 1: Use the property of an equilateral triangle

In an **equilateral triangle**, all three sides are **equal**. This implies:

$$
RS = ST = RT
$$

We will use this fact to form equations.

---

### Step 2: Set up equations based on equality of sides

#### First, set $ RS = ST $:

$$
x + 9 = 2x
\Rightarrow 9 = x
$$

Now substitute $ x = 9 $ into the other expressions to verify consistency.

- $ RS = x + 9 = 9 + 9 = 18 $
- $ ST = 2x = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 $
- $ RT = 3x - 9 = 3 \cdot 9 - 9 = 27 - 9 = 18 $

All sides are indeed equal (each is 18), confirming that the triangle is equilateral and consistent with the given conditions.

---

### Step 3: Final Verification

All three sides evaluate to the same length when $ x = 9 $, satisfying the condition for an equilateral triangle.

---

### Conclusion

The value of $ x $ that makes the triangle equilateral is:

$$
\boxed{9}
$$
