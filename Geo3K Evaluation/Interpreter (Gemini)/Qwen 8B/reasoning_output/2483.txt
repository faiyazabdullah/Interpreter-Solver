<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, we have several points: M, P, O, Q, N. There are triangles mentioned: Triangle(M,P,O) and Triangle(M,Q,N). Also, there are lines connecting various points. The key constraints here involve parallel lines and similar triangles. Let me jot down the important details:

1. Lines QN and PO are parallel. 
2. The lengths of MQ is 5 units, MN is 6 units, and NO is 3.6 units. We need to find the length of QP, which is denoted as x.
3. Triangles MQR and MPO (wait, actually it says Triangle(M,Q,N) is similar to Triangle(M,P,O)). So, triangle M-Q-N is similar to triangle M-P-O. 

Let me visualize this. Since both triangles share the point M, maybe they are similar with some scaling factor. Also, since QN is parallel to PO, that suggests that the corresponding angles might be equal, reinforcing the similarity. 

Given the similarity of the two triangles, their corresponding sides should be proportional. Let's denote the ratio of similarity between triangle M-Q-N and triangle M-P-O. Let me think about which sides correspond. 

In triangle M-Q-N and triangle M-P-O, since they are similar, the order of the vertices matters. So, vertex M corresponds to M, Q corresponds to P, and N corresponds to O? Wait, but the notation for similarity is usually based on the order. So Triangle(M,Q,N) ~ Triangle(M,P,O) implies that angle at M corresponds to angle at M, angle at Q corresponds to angle at P, and angle at N corresponds to angle at O. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles would be proportional. 

Wait, perhaps another approach: For similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So, side MQ corresponds to MP, side QN corresponds to PO, and side MN corresponds to MO? Or wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. 

If triangle M-Q-N ~ triangle M-P-O, then the correspondence is M→M, Q→P, N→O. Therefore, the sides opposite these vertices would be proportional. 

But in triangle M-Q-N, the sides are MQ, QN, and MN. In triangle M-P-O, the sides are MP, PO, and MO. 

Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be MQ/MP = QN/PO = MN/MO. 

But also, since QN is parallel to PO, which might mean that those sides are corresponding sides in the similar triangles. Wait, but if QN || PO, then maybe those lines are corresponding sides. But in the similar triangles, the sides QN and PO would be corresponding because they're the ones that are parallel. 

Alternatively, since QN and PO are parallel, maybe the triangles are similar via AA similarity (since corresponding angles would be equal due to the parallel lines). 

Let me try to write down the proportions. Given the similarity, we can set up ratios. 

From the similarity of triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Let's take the ratio of MQ to MP, which should equal the ratio of MN to MO, and also equal the ratio of QN to PO. 

We know MQ is 5 units, MN is 6 units. Let me note that. Also, NO is given as 3.6 units. Wait, NO is part of triangle M-P-O? Let me check. 

Looking back, the line segments mentioned include Line(N,O), so NO is a segment. Since triangle M-P-O has sides MP, PO, and MO. So, NO is part of triangle M-P-O? Not sure yet. Wait, but maybe NO is part of another structure. 

Wait, the problem mentions that Line(N,O) is present, and its length is 3.6. Also, we have Line(M,N) with length 6. Let me see. 

Since triangle M-Q-N has sides MQ=5, MN=6, and QN. Then, triangle M-P-O has sides MP, PO, and MO. Because of the similarity, the ratios between corresponding sides should be equal. 

So, if we consider the ratio of MQ / MP = MN / MO = QN / PO. 

But we don't know MP, MO, or PO. However, we do know that QN is parallel to PO. Maybe that gives us more relations. 

Also, there's a ratio given: the ratio of MQ to MP equals the ratio of MN to MO. Which is already covered by the similarity. 

But we might need to connect the known lengths. Let me think. 

We know that MN is 6, and NO is 3.6. Wait, NO is part of triangle M-P-O? If O is connected to N? Wait, the points involved are M, P, O, Q, N. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose point M is common to both triangles. So, triangle M-Q-N and triangle M-P-O share vertex M. The lines QN and PO are parallel. 

Given that QN || PO, then the triangles could be similar by AA similarity, since the corresponding angles would be equal. 

Now, considering the ratio of similarity. Let me focus on the sides we know. 

In triangle M-Q-N, the sides are MQ=5, MN=6, and QN. 

In triangle M-P-O, the sides are MP, MO, and PO. 

Because of the similarity, the ratio between MQ and MP should equal the ratio between MN and MO. So:

MQ / MP = MN / MO

But we don't know MP or MO. However, there's another piece of info: NO is 3.6. How does that fit in?

Wait, NO is part of triangle M-P-O? If O is connected to N? Wait, maybe there's another relation. 

Wait, line NO is given. Since triangle M-P-O includes points M, P, O. So, the sides are MP, PO, and MO. But line NO connects N and O. So, unless N is connected to O through another path... Hmm. Maybe there's something else here. 

Alternatively, since QN is parallel to PO, and we have triangle M-Q-N similar to triangle M-P-O, then perhaps QN corresponds to PO. So, QN / PO = MQ / MP. 

Also, since QN is parallel to PO, then maybe there's a way to express QN in terms of other lengths. 

But we don't know QN directly. Wait, but maybe using the fact that MN is 6 and NO is 3.6. Let me think. 

If we can express QN in terms of other variables. Alternatively, maybe we can use the proportionality from the similar triangles. 

Let me consider that the ratio of similarity between the two triangles is k. So, k = MQ / MP = MN / MO = QN / PO. 

But since we have MN = 6 and NO = 3.6. Wait, NO is part of triangle M-P-O? If O is connected to N, then maybe NO is part of another triangle? 

Alternatively, perhaps triangle MNO or something else. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me try again. 

Let me consider that triangle M-Q-N is similar to triangle M-P-O. Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal. Let me assume that the correspondence is such that angle at M is common. So, the sides adjacent to angle M in each triangle are MQ and MN for triangle M-Q-N, and MP and MO for triangle M-P-O. 

Thus, the ratio would be MQ / MP = MN / MO. 

Additionally, since QN is parallel to PO, then the sides QN and PO are corresponding sides in the similar triangles. Thus, QN / PO = same ratio. 

But we don't know QN or PO. However, maybe we can relate them using other given information. 

Wait, but we also have line NO with length 3.6. How is that related? 

Perhaps triangle MNO? If N is connected to O, then maybe triangle MNO has sides MN, NO, and MO. Since MN is 6, NO is 3.6, so we can compute MO if needed. 

Wait, yes! If we consider triangle MNO, then by Pythagoras or Law of Cosines? Wait, but we don't know the type of triangle. Unless there's a right angle? Wait, no information about right angles. 

Wait, but maybe the triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O are similar, and we can relate the sides. Let me try to write equations. 

From the similarity ratio:

MQ / MP = MN / MO = QN / PO = k

We need to find QP, which is the length of line QP. Wait, but QP isn't directly part of the triangles mentioned. Wait, the question asks for QP, which is the length of Line(Q,P). 

Hmm, so QP is part of triangle M-Q-P? Or maybe another triangle. Let me think. 

Wait, the points involved are M, Q, P, N, O. The lines given are Line(Q,N), Line(P,O), Line(M,Q), Line(M,P), Line(M,N), Line(M,O). Also, Line(Q,N) is parallel to Line(P,O). 

So, perhaps quadrilateral QNOP is formed? Or maybe some other configuration. 

Alternatively, since QN is parallel to PO, and both are connected to M through lines MQ and MP. This makes me think of a trapezoid, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, and both triangles share the point M, perhaps they form a transversal with the parallels. 

Let me go back to the similarity ratio. Let me denote:

From triangle similarity, MQ / MP = MN / MO = QN / PO = k.

We know MQ = 5, MN = 6. Let me call MP = a, MO = b, QN = c, PO = d. 

So,

5/a = 6/b = c/d = k.

Also, since QN is parallel to PO, maybe there's a relation between QN and PO. But without knowing angles or other sides, it's tricky. 

However, there's another equation given: the ratio of MQ to MP equals the ratio of MN to MO. Which we already have as 5/a = 6/b. 

But how can we find more relations? Well, there's also the length of NO = 3.6. How is NO related to other parts? 

If we look at triangle MNO, assuming that N is connected to O, then MN = 6, NO = 3.6, and MO = b. So, in triangle MNO, we have sides 6, 3.6, and b. But without knowing the angles or being told it's a right triangle, we can't apply Pythagoras. 

Wait, but maybe triangle MNO is similar to another triangle? Or perhaps using the Law of Cosines? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle MNO relates to the similar triangles. 

Wait, since triangle M-Q-N is similar to triangle M-P-O, and we have QN || PO, which may imply that triangles are similar in such a way that MO is related to other sides. 

Alternatively, maybe considering coordinates. Assigning coordinates to points to model the situation. That might help. 

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point M at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. 

Assume that line MQ is along the x-axis. Let me define coordinates:

- Let’s say M is at (0,0).
- Since MQ is 5 units long, and assuming it's along x-axis, then Q is at (5,0). 
- Now, line MN is 6 units. But we need to determine direction. Since there's a line MN, and line QN is parallel to PO. 

Wait, but without knowing angles, this might get complex. Maybe I need to assign coordinates carefully. 

Alternatively, since QN is parallel to PO, and both are connected to M. 

Another thought: Since QN || PO, then vectors QN and PO are scalar multiples. 

Alternatively, since triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is consistent. 

Let me think again about the ratio. From the given, the ratio of MQ to MP equals the ratio of MN to MO. So:

MQ / MP = MN / MO => 5 / MP = 6 / MO => MO = (6 * MP)/5

Also, since triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O are similar, the ratio of QN to PO is also equal to this ratio. So QN / PO = 5 / MP = 6 / MO.

But we don't know QN or PO. However, perhaps we can find QN or PO using other given data. 

Wait, the line NO has length 3.6. How is NO related to the rest? 

If we can express NO in terms of other variables. Let me think about triangle MNO. If we can find MO, and we know MN and NO, perhaps we can relate them. 

But again, without knowing angles, it's hard. However, maybe triangle MNO is similar to another triangle? 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, and considering the transversal lines. 

Wait, suppose that QN || PO. Then, considering the transversal lines MQ and MP. 

This setup resembles the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), where a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides proportionally. 

But in this case, since QN is parallel to PO, and both pass through different points. 

Alternatively, think of triangle MPO, with a line QN parallel to PO. Wait, but QN is not necessarily inside triangle MPO. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle MQN and triangle MPO are similar, as given. 

Wait, going back, the similarity ratio is k = MQ / MP = MN / MO. 

If I can express MO in terms of MP, then maybe combine with NO's length. 

Let me denote MP as 'a', so MO = (6/5)a. 

Now, looking at triangle MNO, which has sides MN=6, NO=3.6, and MO=(6/5)a. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle MNO:

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at M between MN and MO. 

But without knowing theta, this seems difficult. 

Alternatively, if triangle MNO is part of the similar triangles? 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Since QN || PO, and considering the lines. 

Let me think about vector approaches. Suppose vectors from M to Q and M to P. 

Since QN || PO, then vector QN is a scalar multiple of vector PO. 

Vector QN = N - Q. Vector PO = O - P. 

But without knowing coordinates, this might not be helpful. 

Alternative idea: Use the fact that in similar triangles, the ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of sides. But again, not sure. 

Wait, but the problem also states that Add(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,P))) and Add(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,O))). 

Wait, the problem says "Add(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,P)))" and "Add(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,O)))". Are these additions equal? Wait, the original problem says:

"Add(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,P)))"
"Add(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,O)))"
"Equals(RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(M,P))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(M,O))))"

Ah, so the equality is between the ratios of MQ/MP and MN/MO. And the addition of MQ + QP equals MN + NO? Or is there a connection between these additions? Wait, the problem says that "Add(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,P)))" and "Add(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,O)))" — but it's unclear if these additions are equal or related. Wait, looking back:

The last constraint is:

Equals(RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(M,P))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(M,O))))

Which means that the ratio MQ/MP equals MN/MO. Which we've already considered.

But there's also the mention of adding MQ + QP and MN + NO. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state that these sums are equal. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Original problem statement:

"Add(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,P)))
Add(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,O)))
Equals(RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), LengthOf(Line(M,P))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), LengthOf(Line(M,O))))"

So these additions are separate. It doesn't say they are equal. So that might not be useful. 

Back to the main issue. We need to find QP. Let me consider that QP is part of triangle QPM or something else. 

Wait, QP is the segment connecting Q and P. Since we have points Q and P, and we know MQ = 5, MP is unknown. 

If I can find MP, then maybe using the coordinates or the similar triangles. 

Let me recall that triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O are similar. So, the ratio of similarity is MQ/MP = MN/MO. 

Let me call this ratio k. So, k = MQ/MP = MN/MO. 

We also know that NO = 3.6. How does this relate to MO? 

Well, if we consider triangle MNO, which has sides MN = 6, NO = 3.6, and MO. 

If we can find MO, then we can relate it to MP via k. 

But how? Without additional info, it's challenging. Unless there's a relation from the similar triangles. 

Wait, in triangle M-P-O, the side PO is corresponding to QN in the similar triangles. So, QN / PO = k. 

But we don't know QN or PO. 

Wait, but QN is part of triangle M-Q-N. In that triangle, sides are MQ = 5, MN = 6, and QN. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle M-Q-N:

QN² = MQ² + MN² - 2*MQ*MN*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at M between MQ and MN. 

Similarly, in triangle M-P-O, PO² = MP² + MO² - 2*MP*MO*cos(phi), where phi is the angle at M between MP and MO. 

But since the triangles are similar, the angles at M are equal. Hence, theta = phi. 

So, cos(theta) is the same for both triangles. 

Let me denote cos(theta) = c. 

Then, QN² = 5² + 6² - 2*5*6*c = 25 + 36 - 60c = 61 - 60c.

And PO² = MP² + MO² - 2*MP*MO*c.

But from the similarity, we also have QN / PO = k = 5/MP = 6/MO. 

Let me write k = 5/MP = 6/MO → MO = (6/5)*MP. 

So, substituting into PO²: 

PO = k * QN → QN = PO / k.

But from the earlier expression, QN² = 61 - 60c, and PO² = ?

Alternatively, maybe we can relate MO and MP through the Law of Cosines in triangle MNO. 

Wait, in triangle MNO, we have sides MN=6, NO=3.6, and MO. 

Using Law of Cosines:

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(theta)

Wait, because angle at M between MN and MO is the same theta as before. 

So:

(3.6)^2 = 6^2 + MO^2 - 2*6*MO*cos(theta)

Which simplifies to:

12.96 = 36 + MO² - 12*MO*c

Rearranged:

MO² - 12*MO*c + 36 - 12.96 = 0 → MO² - 12c*MO + 23.04 = 0

But from triangle M-Q-N, we had QN² = 61 - 60c. 

Also, from similarity, QN = k * PO. But PO is part of triangle M-P-O, which has sides MP, MO, and PO. 

Alternatively, since QN = k * PO, and k = 5/MP, then QN = (5/MP) * PO. 

But I still don't know PO. 

This seems too abstract. Maybe I need another approach. Let me think again about the ratio. 

We know that MQ / MP = MN / MO = 5 / MP = 6 / MO → MO = (6/5) * MP. 

Let me call MP = a. Then MO = (6/5)a. 

Now, consider triangle MNO with sides MN=6, NO=3.6, MO=(6/5)a. 

Apply Law of Cosines:

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(theta)

Plugging in values:

(3.6)^2 = 6^2 + [(6/5)a]^2 - 2*6*(6/5)a*cos(theta)

Which is:

12.96 = 36 + (36/25)a² - (72/5)a*cos(theta)

But from triangle M-Q-N, we have QN² = 61 - 60cos(theta). Also, from the similarity, QN / PO = k = 5/a. 

But PO is the side in triangle M-P-O. Let me consider triangle M-P-O. Its sides are MP=a, MO=(6/5)a, and PO. 

Using Law of Cosines on triangle M-P-O:

PO² = a² + ((6/5)a)^2 - 2*a*(6/5)a*cos(theta)

Which is PO² = a² + (36/25)a² - (12/5)a²*cos(theta) = (61/25)a² - (12/5)a²*cos(theta)

But also, from the similarity ratio, QN / PO = 5/a → QN = (5/a) * PO. 

But QN² = 61 - 60cos(theta) from earlier. 

So, substituting QN = (5/a) * PO into QN²:

(25/a²) * PO² = 61 - 60cos(theta)

But PO² is (61/25)a² - (12/5)a²*cos(theta). Substitute that:

(25/a²)[(61/25)a² - (12/5)a²*cos(theta)] = 61 - 60cos(theta)

Simplify left side:

25/a² * 61/25 a² - 25/a² * 12/5 a² cos(theta) = 61 - 60cos(theta)

Which becomes:

61 - 60cos(theta) = 61 - 60cos(theta)

So, it's an identity. This means our previous steps are consistent but don't give new information. 

Hmm, so this approach leads us in circles. Need another strategy. 

Maybe I need to consider that QN || PO, so the slope of QN equals the slope of PO. Let me try coordinate geometry again with specific assignments. 

Let me place point M at (0,0). Let me assume that line MQ is along the x-axis, so Q is at (5,0). 

Now, line MN has length 6. Let me assume that point N is somewhere such that distance from M(0,0) to N(x,y) is 6. Let me pick coordinates for N. To simplify, let me assume that N lies along the y-axis, so N is at (0,6). But then line QN would be from (5,0) to (0,6). The slope of QN would be (6-0)/(0-5) = -6/5. 

Now, since QN is parallel to PO, the line PO must have the same slope. Let me assume that point P is somewhere, and point O is such that line PO has slope -6/5. 

But also, triangle M-P-O is similar to triangle M-Q-N. Let me think about the coordinates. 

First, triangle M-Q-N has points M(0,0), Q(5,0), N(0,6). This triangle has legs of length 5 and 6, right angle at M? Wait, because MQ is horizontal, MN is vertical. Yes, right angle at M. So triangle M-Q-N is a right triangle with legs 5 and 6, hypotenuse QN. 

If triangle M-P-O is similar to this, then it must also be a right triangle with legs in the ratio 5:6. 

So, triangle M-P-O is a right triangle with right angle at M, and legs MP and MO in the ratio 5:6. 

Wait, but earlier we said that the ratio of MQ/MP = MN/MO = 5/MP = 6/MO. So if this is a right triangle, then MP and MO would be the legs, and PO the hypotenuse. 

But since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the legs should be the same. 

So, if triangle M-P-O is similar to triangle M-Q-N, which has legs 5 and 6, then the legs of triangle M-P-O should be in the same ratio. So, MP : MO = 5 : 6. 

But earlier we had from the similarity ratio: 5/MP = 6/MO → MO = (6/5) MP. So this matches with MP : MO = 5 : 6. 

Great! So this confirms that triangle M-P-O is a right triangle with legs MP and MO in ratio 5:6. 

Now, we also know that NO = 3.6. Let me find coordinates for points P and O. 

Let me assume that the right angle is at M, so MP and MO are perpendicular. Let me define coordinates for P and O such that MP is along x-axis and MO along y-axis, but wait, in this case, since triangle M-Q-N is right-angled at M, and triangle M-P-O is similar, it must also be right-angled at M. So, MP and MO are perpendicular. 

But earlier, we placed Q at (5,0) and N at (0,6), making MQ along x-axis and MN along y-axis. Now, for triangle M-P-O, if it's right-angled at M, then MP and MO are perpendicular. Let me assume that MP is along x-axis and MO is along y-axis. Wait, but then PO would be the hypotenuse. 

But in this case, point P would be along x-axis from M(0,0), say at (a, 0), and O would be along y-axis at (0, b). 

But then line PO connects (a,0) to (0,b), which has slope -b/a. Earlier, QN has slope -6/5, so PO must also have slope -6/5. Hence, -b/a = -6/5 → b/a = 6/5 → b = (6/5)a. 

Also, from the similarity ratio, since triangle M-P-O is similar to triangle M-Q-N, the ratio of legs MP/5 = MO/6. Since MP = a, MO = b = (6/5)a. 

So that checks out. 

Now, we need to find NO, which is the distance between N(0,6) and O(0,b). Wait, because O is at (0,b)? No, wait. Wait, in this setup, O is along y-axis at (0,b). Point N is at (0,6). So, the distance NO is |b - 6|. 

But we are given that NO = 3.6. So:

|b - 6| = 3.6 → b - 6 = ±3.6. 

So, b = 6 ± 3.6. So, either b = 9.6 or b = 2.4. 

Now, we need to determine which one is correct. 

Let me think about the orientation. If the triangles are oriented similarly, then depending on the direction of O relative to N. 

But since QN is from Q(5,0) to N(0,6), which goes upwards and leftwards. PO is from P(a,0) to O(0,b), which has slope -b/a = -6/5. So, if a > 0, then b is positive. 

Now, if O is above N, then b > 6 → b = 9.6. If O is below N, then b < 6 → b = 2.4. 

But since the problem doesn't specify, we need to determine based on other constraints. 

But let's proceed with both possibilities. 

Case 1: b = 9.6 → O is at (0,9.6). Then, NO = 9.6 - 6 = 3.6, which matches. 

Case 2: b = 2.4 → O is at (0,2.4). Then, NO = 6 - 2.4 = 3.6, which also matches. 

So both cases are possible. But how to decide which one is correct? 

Let me consider the similarity of triangles. Since triangle M-P-O is similar to triangle M-Q-N. In triangle M-Q-N, the right angle is at M, and legs MQ=5, MN=6. So, the hypotenuse QN is sqrt(5² + 6²) = sqrt(61). 

In triangle M-P-O, the legs are MP = a, MO = (6/5)a. Hypotenuse PO = sqrt(a² + (6/5 a)^2) = sqrt(a² + 36/25 a²) = sqrt(61/25 a²) = (sqrt(61)/5)a. 

Now, the ratio of similarity between the triangles is k = MQ / MP = 5/a. 

But also, the ratio of the hypotenuses is QN / PO = sqrt(61) / (sqrt(61)/5 a) ) = 5/a. Which matches. So both cases are valid. 

Now, we need to find QP. Q is at (5,0), P is at (a,0). So QP is the distance between (5,0) and (a,0), which is |5 - a|. 

So QP = |a - 5|. 

Our goal is to find the value of a. 

How can we determine a? 

Recall that in triangle M-P-O, the hypotenuse PO is (sqrt(61)/5)a. Also, from the earlier calculation, in Case 1: b = 9.6, and in Case 2: b = 2.4. 

But how does this relate to a? 

Wait, in Case 1: O is at (0,9.6), and P is at (a,0). The line PO connects (a,0) to (0,9.6), which has slope -9.6/a = -6/5 (as per earlier condition). 

So, -9.6/a = -6/5 → 9.6/a = 6/5 → a = (9.6 * 5)/6 = (48)/6 = 8. 

So, a = 8. 

In Case 2: O is at (0,2.4). Slope of PO is -2.4/a = -6/5 → 2.4/a = 6/5 → a = (2.4 * 5)/6 = 12/6 = 2. 

So, a = 2. 

Thus, depending on whether O is above or below N, a is 8 or 2. 

Now, we need to determine which case applies. 

Let me think about the position of O. Since triangle M-P-O is similar to triangle M-Q-N. In triangle M-Q-N, the right angle is at M, and the hypotenuse QN is from (5,0) to (0,6). In the similar triangle, the hypotenuse PO would be from (a,0) to (0,b). Depending on the direction, a and b can vary. 

But how to determine which case is correct? 

Perhaps using the fact that line PO is parallel to QN, which we already used. 

Alternatively, since in both cases, the conditions are satisfied. So, there might be two solutions. However, the answer choices are fixed, so maybe only one of them matches. 

Let me calculate QP in both cases:

Case 1: a = 8 → QP = |8 - 5| = 3. 

Case 2: a = 2 → QP = |2 - 5| = 3. 

Wait, both cases give QP = 3. 

Wait, that's interesting. Both scenarios result in QP = 3. 

But the answer choices include option B as 3.6, option C as 5, etc. Wait, but according to this, QP is 3. But 3 is not listed as an option. Wait, the answer choices are A. 2, B. 3.6, C. 5, D. 6. 

Hmm, but my calculation shows QP is 3. But 3 is not among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck. 

In Case 1: a = 8 → QP is distance between Q(5,0) and P(8,0) is 3. 

In Case 2: a = 2 → QP is distance between Q(5,0) and P(2,0) is 3. 

So regardless of the case, QP is 3. But 3 is not an option. The options are A.2, B.3.6, C.5, D.6. 

Hmm, this discrepancy suggests an error in reasoning. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the assumption that triangle M-P-O is right-angled at M. Is this necessarily true? 

The problem states that triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O are similar. We assumed that the right angle is at M because in triangle M-Q-N, the right angle was at M (since MQ and MN were perpendicular). However, this assumes that the similarity preserves the right angle, which is true if the original triangle has a right angle. 

But what if the original triangle wasn't right-angled? Wait, in the initial setup, I assumed that triangle M-Q-N is right-angled at M because I placed N at (0,6) and Q at (5,0), making MQ and MN perpendicular. But this is just one possibility; the triangle could be non-right-angled. 

Ah! Here's the mistake. I forced the triangle M-Q-N to be right-angled at M by placing N on the y-axis, but the problem didn't state that triangle M-Q-N is right-angled. The only thing we know is that it is similar to triangle M-P-O, and QN is parallel to PO. 

So, my assumption that triangle M-Q-N is right-angled is incorrect. I cannot assume that. That's where the error occurred. 

So, I need to revisit the coordinate approach without assuming a right angle. 

Let me start over. Let me place M at (0,0). Let me assign coordinates such that line MQ is along x-axis, so Q is at (5,0). 

Let me define point N somewhere such that MN = 6. Let me parameterize N as (x, y) with x² + y² = 6² = 36. 

Line QN is from Q(5,0) to N(x,y). The slope of QN is (y - 0)/(x - 5) = y/(x-5). 

Since QN is parallel to PO, which is the line from P to O. Let me assume that P is at some point (p_x, p_y), and O is at (o_x, o_y). 

But this seems too vague. Perhaps another approach. 

Since triangles M-Q-N and M-P-O are similar, and QN || PO. 

Let me consider the ratio of similarity. As before, k = MQ/MP = MN/MO = QN/PO. 

Also, since QN || PO, the vectors QN and PO are scalar multiples. 

Let me denote vector QN = N - Q = (x_N - 5, y_N - 0) = (x_N - 5, y_N). 

Vector PO = O - P = (o_x - p_x, o_y - p_y). 

Since they are parallel, there exists a scalar λ such that:

o_x - p_x = λ(x_N - 5)

o_y - p_y = λ(y_N)

Also, since triangles are similar, the ratio of sides is k. 

But this seems too abstract. Maybe using mass point or parametric relations. 

Alternatively, consider that since QN || PO, the triangles are similar with the ratio k, and the direction of QN and PO is the same. 

But I'm stuck here. 

Wait, let's recall that we also have NO = 3.6. 

If I can relate NO to other variables. 

In the coordinate system, N is (x, y), O is some point. 

But without knowing where O is, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but in triangle M-P-O, which is similar to triangle M-Q-N. Let me think about the homothety (scaling) that maps one triangle to another. 

Since the triangles are similar and share point M, the center of similarity is M. 

So, the homothety centered at M that maps triangle M-Q-N to M-P-O scales MQ to MP, QN to PO, and MN to MO. 

Thus, the scale factor is k = MQ/MP = MN/MO. 

Also, since QN || PO, the direction of QN is the same as PO. 

Let me consider the vector from M to Q: MQ = vector Q - M = (5,0) - (0,0) = (5,0). 

The vector from M to N is vector N - M = (x, y). 

Under the homothety, vector MQ maps to vector MP, and vector MN maps to vector MO. 

So, vector MP = k * vector MQ = k*(5,0). 

Vector MO = k * vector MN = k*(x, y). 

Thus, point P is M + k*vector MQ = (k*5, 0). 

Point O is M + k*vector MN = (k*x, k*y). 

Now, we know that NO = 3.6. 

Coordinates of N: (x, y). Coordinates of O: (kx, ky). 

Distance NO is sqrt[(kx - x)^2 + (ky - y)^2] = sqrt[ (x(k - 1))^2 + (y(k - 1))^2 ] = |k - 1| * sqrt(x² + y²). 

But sqrt(x² + y²) is the length of MN, which is 6. 

So, NO = |k - 1| * 6 = 3.6. 

Therefore:

|k - 1| * 6 = 3.6 → |k - 1| = 3.6 / 6 = 0.6 → k - 1 = ±0.6 → k = 1 ± 0.6 → k = 1.6 or k = 0.4. 

So, two possibilities for k: 1.6 or 0.4. 

Now, let's analyze both cases. 

Case 1: k = 1.6 (which is 8/5). 

Case 2: k = 0.4 (which is 2/5). 

Now, let's find QP. 

Point Q is (5,0). Point P is (k*5, 0) = (5k, 0). 

So, QP is the distance between (5,0) and (5k, 0) = |5k - 5| = 5|k - 1|. 

From above, |k - 1| = 0.6, so QP = 5 * 0.6 = 3. 

Same as before. 

But wait, this gives QP = 3, which is not one of the answer choices. However, the options are A.2, B.3.6, C.5, D.6. 

This suggests that either there is an error in the assumptions or the answer choices are incorrect. But since this is a standardized problem, likely my approach has an error. 

Wait, let's double-check the calculation for NO. 

NO is the distance between N and O. 

Coordinates of N: (x, y), which satisfies x² + y² = 6² = 36. 

Coordinates of O: (kx, ky). 

So, vector from N to O is (kx - x, ky - y) = (x(k - 1), y(k - 1)). 

Length NO = sqrt[x²(k - 1)^2 + y²(k - 1)^2] = |k - 1| * sqrt(x² + y²) = |k - 1| * 6. 

Yes, correct. So, |k - 1| * 6 = 3.6 → |k - 1| = 0.6 → k = 1.6 or 0.4. 

QP = 5|k - 1| = 5 * 0.6 = 3. 

But 3 is not an option. This indicates either the problem is flawed, or my understanding is missing something. 

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. 

Wait, the question asks for QP, which is the length of Line(Q,P). In the coordinate system, QP is |5k - 5| = 5|k - 1|. 

With |k - 1| = 0.6 → QP = 3. 

But none of the options is 3. However, let me check if there's an alternative interpretation. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating QP? 

No, in the coordinate system, Q is at (5,0), P is at (5k, 0). So, distance is |5 - 5k| = 5|1 - k|. 

Yes, and since |k - 1| = 0.6, it's 5 * 0.6 = 3. 

But the options don't have 3. This suggests that either the answer choices are wrong, or there's an error in the logic. 

Wait, let me re-examine the homothety approach. 

We assumed that the homothety centered at M maps MQ to MP and MN to MO. This is valid because the triangles are similar and share the vertex M. 

But what if the similarity is not direct? Like, maybe the order of the vertices is different? 

For example, maybe triangle M-Q-N is similar to triangle M-O-P instead of M-P-O? 

Wait, the problem says Similar(Triangle(M,Q,N), Triangle(M,P,O)). So, the correspondence is M→M, Q→P, N→O. 

Thus, the homothety maps Q to P and N to O. 

Thus, vector MQ maps to vector MP, and vector MN maps to vector MO. 

Hence, the earlier calculation holds. 

But why is the answer not among the choices? Let me check the problem again. 

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)), 5) → MQ = 5. 

Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), 6) → MN = 6. 

Equals(LengthOf(Line(N,O)), 3.6) → NO = 3.6. 

So, all these are correct. 

But according to the calculation, QP = 3. 

However, the options are A.2, B.3.6, C.5, D.6. 

Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recalculate QP. 

If k = 1.6, then P is at (5k, 0) = (8, 0). Q is at (5, 0). So QP = 8 - 5 = 3. 

If k = 0.4, then P is at (5*0.4, 0) = (2, 0). Q is at (5,0). QP = 5 - 2 = 3. 

Either way, QP = 3. 

But since 3 is not an option, this suggests that either the problem is flawed, or there is an error in the assumptions. 

Wait, perhaps the similarity is reversed? Like, triangle M-Q-N is similar to triangle M-O-P instead of M-P-O? 

Let me check the problem statement: "Similar(Triangle(M,Q,N), Triangle(M,P,O))". So, it's M-Q-N similar to M-P-O, so the correspondence is M-M, Q-P, N-O. 

But what if the similarity is M-Q-N ~ M-O-P? Then the correspondence would be M-M, Q-O, N-P. 

This would change the homothety mapping. 

Let me explore this possibility. 

If the similarity is M-Q-N ~ M-O-P, then the correspondence is M→M, Q→O, N→P. 

Then, vector MQ maps to vector MO, and vector MN maps to vector MP. 

So, vector MO = k * vector MQ, and vector MP = k * vector MN. 

So, point O is M + k*vector MQ = (5k, 0). 

Point P is M + k*vector MN = (k*x, k*y). 

Then, NO is the distance between N(x, y) and O(5k, 0). 

So, NO² = (5k - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = (5k - x)^2 + y². 

But this is different from before. 

But we also know that NO = 3.6. 

But without knowing x and y, this is difficult. 

But since MN = 6, x² + y² = 36. 

So, NO² = (5k - x)^2 + y² = 25k² - 10kx + x² + y² = 25k² - 10kx + 36. 

But this introduces variable x, which we don't know. 

This seems more complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in assuming that the homothety maps MQ to MP and MN to MO. If the similarity is different, like M-Q-N ~ M-P-O with different correspondence. 

Wait, the problem states: Similar(Triangle(M,Q,N), Triangle(M,P,O)). This means that the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So, the first vertex of the first triangle corresponds to the first vertex of the second triangle, etc. So, M corresponds to M, Q corresponds to P, N corresponds to O. 

Thus, the earlier analysis holds. 

But why is the answer not matching? 

Wait, maybe the problem uses directed lengths or absolute values differently? Or perhaps there's a miscalculation in NO? 

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for NO. 

In the homothety approach, when k = 1.6, O is at (kx, ky). N is at (x, y). 

So, NO = |k - 1| * 6 = 0.6 * 6 = 3.6, which matches. 

So, the calculation is correct. 

But QP is 3. Since 3 is not an option, perhaps the answer is B.3.6, but that doesn't align. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in defining the homothety. Let me think again. 

If the similarity is between Triangle(M,Q,N) and Triangle(M,P,O), then the correspondence is M-M, Q-P, N-O. 

Thus, the homothety centered at M maps Q to P and N to O. 

So, the vector from M to Q (MQ) is scaled by k to get vector from M to P (MP), and vector from M to N (MN) is scaled by k to get vector from M to O (MO). 

Thus, P = M + k*MQ, and O = M + k*MN. 

Thus, P is at (5k, 0), and O is at (k*x, k*y). 

Then, the distance NO is between N(x, y) and O(kx, ky): 

NO = sqrt[(kx - x)^2 + (ky - y)^2] = |k - 1| * sqrt(x² + y²) = |k - 1| * 6 = 3.6 → |k - 1| = 0.6. 

So, k = 1.6 or 0.4. 

Then, QP is the distance between Q(5,0) and P(5k, 0) = |5k - 5| = 5|k - 1| = 5 * 0.6 = 3. 

Still 3. 

Since 3 is not an option, but the closest option is B.3.6. But why? 

Wait, perhaps the problem meant to ask for QN or something else? Or maybe there's a miscalculation in the homothety. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the similarity is not direct, but the triangles are similar in a different order. For example, M-Q-N ~ M-O-P, leading to different correspondence. 

Let me try this. Assume that Triangle(M,Q,N) ~ Triangle(M,O,P). So, M corresponds to M, Q corresponds to O, N corresponds to P. 

Then, the homothety maps Q to O and N to P. 

So, vector MQ maps to vector MO, and vector MN maps to vector MP. 

Thus, O = M + k*MQ = (5k, 0). 

P = M + k*MN = (k*x, k*y). 

Now, NO is the distance between N(x, y) and O(5k, 0). 

So, NO² = (5k - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = (5k - x)^2 + y². 

But since x² + y² = 36, this becomes (5k - x)^2 + (36 - x²) = 25k² - 10kx + x² + 36 - x² = 25k² - 10kx + 36. 

But we know NO = 3.6, so:

25k² - 10kx + 36 = (3.6)^2 = 12.96. 

So, 25k² - 10kx = 12.96 - 36 = -23.04. 

But this introduces x, which is unknown. 

Without additional information, this equation cannot be solved. 

Thus, this approach doesn't help. 

At this point, it seems that the only logical conclusion is that QP = 3, but since this is not an option, there might be an error in the problem or in the provided choices. 

However, since the options are given, and the closest possible answer is B.3.6, but that doesn't align with the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the similarity. 

Wait, let me try to think differently. Suppose the ratio is not k = MQ/MP = MN/MO, but instead, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of MQ/MN = MP/PO or something else? 

Wait, no. For similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So, if Triangle(M,Q,N) ~ Triangle(M,P,O), then:

MQ / MP = QN / PO = MN / MO. 

So, the ratio is MQ/MP = MN/MO. 

But if I use this ratio, and also consider that QN is parallel to PO, which might imply that QN/PO = MQ/MP, and also that QN/PO = MN/MO. 

But how to relate this to NO? 

Wait, let me try using the ratio. 

Let me call the ratio k = MQ/MP = MN/MO. 

So, k = 5/MP = 6/MO → MO = (6/5)MP. 

Now, consider triangle MNO. It has sides MN = 6, MO = (6/5)MP, and NO = 3.6. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle MNO:

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at M between MN and MO. 

But from triangle M-Q-N, we can find cos(theta). 

In triangle M-Q-N, using Law of Cosines:

QN² = MQ² + MN² - 2*MQ*MN*cos(theta) → QN² = 25 + 36 - 60cos(theta) = 61 - 60cos(theta). 

But also, from the similarity, QN/PO = k = 5/MP. 

But PO is the side in triangle M-P-O. Let me use Law of Cosines on triangle M-P-O. 

PO² = MP² + MO² - 2*MP*MO*cos(theta) = MP² + (6/5 MP)^2 - 2*MP*(6/5 MP)*cos(theta) = MP² + (36/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cos(theta) = (61/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cos(theta). 

But QN = k * PO = (5/MP) * PO. 

So, QN² = (25/MP²) * PO² = (25/MP²) * [ (61/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cos(theta) ] = 61 - 60cos(theta), which matches the earlier expression. 

So, this is consistent but doesn't help us find MP. 

However, in triangle MNO, we have:

NO² = 3.6² = 12.96 = 6² + MO² - 2*6*MO*cos(theta). 

Substituting MO = (6/5)MP:

12.96 = 36 + (36/25)MP² - 2*6*(6/5)MP*cos(theta). 

But from triangle M-Q-N, we have 61 - 60cos(theta) = QN². 

But we don't know QN. 

This seems like a dead end. 

Given that all paths lead to QP = 3, which is not an option, and the closest option is B.3.6, but I'm unsure. 

Wait, perhaps the question asks for QP, but in the homothety approach, QP = 3, and the closest option is B.3.6, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the homothety approach. 

Wait, let me check the homothety calculation again. 

If k = 1.6, then QP = 3. If k = 0.4, QP = 3. 

But maybe the actual value of k is different? Let me reconsider the NO calculation. 

NO = |k - 1| * 6 = 3.6 → |k - 1| = 0.6. 

But if k is the ratio of similarity, which is MQ/MP = 5/MP. 

If k = 1.6, then MP = 5/k = 5/1.6 = 3.125. 

If k = 0.4, then MP = 5/0.4 = 12.5. 

But how does this relate to NO? 

Wait, in this scenario, NO is determined by k, and it's fixed at 3.6, which is given. 

But since the problem provides NO = 3.6, this is consistent. 

But QP = 3. 

Since this is not an option, and the closest is B.3.6, but I can't see how to arrive at that. 

Wait, maybe the question wants the value of x, which is QP, and there is a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me think: if the answer is 3, and the options are A.2, B.3.6, C.5, D.6, then perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe I missed a step. 

Wait, let me check if QP is not along the x-axis. In the homothety approach, I assumed that Q and P are on the x-axis, but what if they are not? 

Wait, in the homothety approach, P is at (5k, 0), so it is on the x-axis, and Q is at (5,0). So QP is along the x-axis. 

But what if the coordinate system is different? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors and the length QP is not along the x-axis, but I don't see how. 

Given that all derivations lead to QP = 3, and the options do not include 3, I might have to conclude that the intended answer is B.3.6, possibly due to a miscalculation in the problem, or perhaps the correct answer is B.3.6, and I made a mistake in the homothety approach. 

Wait, let me think: if QP = 3, and the closest option is B.3.6, but maybe the correct answer is B.3.6, and there was a rounding error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the ratio of the sides differently. 

Wait, let me try using the ratio of the sides. 

From the similarity, MQ/MP = MN/MO = 5/MP = 6/MO. 

Let me call this common ratio k. 

So, k = 5/MP = 6/MO → MO = (6/5)MP. 

Now, in triangle MNO, we have sides MN = 6, MO = (6/5)MP, and NO = 3.6. 

Using the Law of Cosines:

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(angle at M). 

Let me call the angle at M as θ. 

So, 3.6² = 6² + (6/5 MP)^2 - 2*6*(6/5 MP)*cosθ. 

Also, from triangle M-Q-N, using Law of Cosines:

QN² = 5² + 6² - 2*5*6*cosθ = 61 - 60cosθ. 

But QN is also equal to k * PO. 

From triangle M-P-O, using Law of Cosines:

PO² = MP² + MO² - 2*MP*MO*cosθ = MP² + (6/5 MP)^2 - 2*MP*(6/5 MP)*cosθ = MP² + (36/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cosθ = (61/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cosθ. 

So, PO = sqrt((61/25)MP² - (12/5)MP² cosθ) = MP * sqrt(61/25 - 12/5 cosθ). 

But QN = k * PO = (5/MP) * PO = (5/MP) * MP * sqrt(...) = 5 * sqrt(61/25 - 12/5 cosθ) = sqrt(61 - 24 cosθ). 

But from earlier, QN² = 61 - 60cosθ. 

So, equating the two expressions for QN²:

61 - 60cosθ = 61 - 24cosθ → -60cosθ = -24cosθ → -60cosθ + 24cosθ = 0 → -36cosθ = 0 → cosθ = 0. 

This implies that θ = 90 degrees. 

So, the angle at M is 90 degrees. 

This means that triangle M-Q-N is a right triangle at M, which matches the earlier assumption. 

So, this confirms that the angle at M is 90 degrees, making the triangles right-angled at M. 

Thus, returning to the Law of Cosines for triangle MNO:

With θ = 90 degrees, cosθ = 0. 

So, NO² = 6² + (6/5 MP)^2 - 0 = 36 + (36/25)MP². 

But NO = 3.6, so:

3.6² = 36 + (36/25)MP² → 12.96 = 36 + (36/25)MP² → (36/25)MP² = 12.96 - 36 = -23.04. 

This is impossible, as the left side is positive and the right side is negative. 

Wait, this contradiction suggests an error. 

Wait, but earlier we derived that cosθ = 0, implying θ = 90 degrees. But with this, the calculation for NO gives a negative value, which is impossible. 

What went wrong? 

Let me re-express. 

From the two expressions for QN²: 

From triangle M-Q-N: QN² = 61 - 60cosθ. 

From the other derivation: QN² = 61 - 24cosθ. 

Setting them equal: 61 - 60cosθ = 61 - 24cosθ → -60cosθ = -24cosθ → -36cosθ = 0 → cosθ = 0. 

This is correct. 

But with cosθ = 0, θ = 90 degrees. 

Now, applying this to the Law of Cosines for triangle MNO:

NO² = 6² + (6/5 MP)^2 - 2*6*(6/5 MP)*0 = 36 + (36/25)MP². 

But NO = 3.6, so:

3.6² = 36 + (36/25)MP² → 12.96 = 36 + (36/25)MP² → (36/25)MP² = 12.96 - 36 = -23.04. 

This is impossible, indicating a contradiction. 

This suggests that there is no solution under the assumption that the angle at M is 90 degrees, which contradicts the earlier derivation. 

This indicates a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. 

Where is the mistake? 

It appears that the assumption that the angle at M is 90 degrees leads to a contradiction, suggesting that the initial assumption of the similarity and the parallel lines might be inconsistent with the given lengths. 

This implies that there might be an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I missed a key insight. 

Given the time spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to rely on the earlier calculation where QP = 3, even though it's not an option. Since the closest option is B.3.6, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.3.6, and the calculation should be QP = 3.6. 

Wait, let me try one last thing. If the angle at M is not 90 degrees, but the calculation led to a contradiction, perhaps there is a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me re-express the Law of Cosines for triangle MNO with θ = 90 degrees. 

If θ = 90 degrees, then triangle MNO is right-angled at M. So, NO is the hypotenuse. 

Thus, NO² = MN² + MO². 

But MO = (6/5)MP. 

So, NO² = 6² + (6/5 MP)^2. 

But NO = 3.6, so:

3.6² = 36 + (36/25)MP² → 12.96 = 36 + (36/25)MP² → (36/25)MP² = 12.96 - 36 = -23.04. 

This is impossible. 

This suggests that with the given conditions, there is no solution, which is conflicting. 

This indicates that the problem might have inconsistent data, or there's a missing piece. 

Given the time invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is B.3.6, but this is uncertain. 

Alternatively, since the calculation gave QP = 3, and the closest option is B.3.6, I might have to choose B. 

But this is highly uncertain. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the homothety approach. Let me check: 

If k = 1.6, then QP = 3. If k = 0.4, QP = 3. 

But if the problem expects QP to be 3.6, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the NO part. 

Wait, let me try with k = 0.4. 

If k = 0.4, then MO = (6/5)*MP = (6/5)*(5/k) = 6/k = 6/0.4 = 15. 

Wait, no, MO = (6/5)*MP. If k = MQ/MP = 5/MP = 0.4 → MP = 5/0.4 = 12.5. 

Then MO = (6/5)*12.5 = 15. 

Now, in triangle MNO, with MN = 6, MO = 15, and NO = 3.6. 

Using the Law of Cosines: 

NO² = MN² + MO² - 2*MN*MO*cos(theta) 

3.6² = 6² + 15² - 2*6*15*cos(theta) 

12.96 = 36 + 225 - 180cos(theta) 

12.96 = 261 - 180cos(theta) 

180cos(theta) = 261 - 12.96 = 248.04 

cos(theta) = 248.04 / 180 ≈ 1.378, which is greater than 1, impossible. 

This is invalid. 

If k = 1.6, then MP = 5/1.6 = 3.125. 

MO = (6/5)*3.125 = 3.75. 

Now, in triangle MNO, MN = 6, MO = 3.75, NO = 3.6. 

Law of Cosines: 

NO² = 6² + 3.75² - 2*6*3.75*cos(theta) 

12.96 = 36 + 14.0625 - 45cos(theta) 

12.96 = 50.06
