====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several points and lines with specific constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see how they connect.

First, there are points S, T, U, R, and A. There's a circle centered at A. The lines mentioned are SR, ST, SU, and TU. Also, some conditions about tangents and secants. 

Let me note down each constraint:

1. Line(S,R) is tangent to Circle(A). That means line SR touches the circle at exactly one point. Since R lies on the circle (as per PointLiesOnCircle(R, Circle(A))), so R is the point of tangency. Wait, but if line SR is tangent to the circle at R, then SR is perpendicular to the radius AR. Because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.

2. Line(S,U) is a secant of Circle(A). So it passes through two points on the circle. Given that U lies on the circle (PointLiesOnCircle(U, Circle(A))), so maybe the line SU intersects the circle at another point? But since U is already on the circle, perhaps the line SU starts at S, goes through U, which is on the circle, and maybe another intersection? Or maybe it's just passing through U and another point? Not sure yet.

Also, Points R, T, and U lie on the circle. So R, T, U are all points on Circle(A). Therefore, lines connecting them might have certain properties.

Other constraints:

- Length(ST) = 5 units.
- Length(SR) = 9 units.
- Length(TU) = x (which we need to find).
- Length(SU) = Length(ST) + Length(TU) → So SU = 5 + x.
- Then, the product of ST and SU equals the square of SR. So ST * SU = (SR)^2.

Wait, the last equation says Mul(LengthOf(ST), LengthOf(SU)) equals SquareOf(SR). So substituting the known values:

ST * SU = SR²  
Given ST is 5, SU is 5 + x, SR is 9. So:

5*(5 + x) = 9²  
Which is 5*(5 + x) = 81  
So expanding that: 25 + 5x = 81  
Subtract 25: 5x = 56  
Divide by 5: x = 56/5 = 11.2

Wait, but hold on. Is that all? Let me check again. The problem mentions that line SU is a secant. So maybe there's more to it? Like power of a point?

But according to the given equations, they directly relate ST * SU = SR². Which seems like applying the power of a point theorem. Let me recall: If a line from point S outside a circle intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, then SP * SQ is equal to the square of the tangent length from S to the circle.

In this case, line SU is a secant that passes through the circle. Since U is on the circle, but does it pass through another point? Let me think. Since line SU is a secant, it should intersect the circle at two points. We know U is one of them. What's the other? Maybe T? Wait, because line TU connects T and U. Wait, but T is also on the circle. Wait, T is on the circle as well. Wait, let me check the constraints again.

The constraints mention:

- PointLiesOnCircle(R, Circle(A)): R is on the circle.
- PointLiesOnCircle(T, Circle(A)): T is on the circle.
- PointLiesOnCircle(U, Circle(A)): U is on the circle.

So points R, T, U are all on the circle. Now, line TU connects T and U, both on the circle. So line TU is a chord of the circle.

But line SU is a secant. Since U is on the circle, and S is outside the circle (since SR is tangent, meaning S is outside). So line SU starts at S, goes through U (on the circle), and possibly another point? Wait, but if line SU only intersects the circle once (at U), then it would be a tangent. But the problem states that SU is a secant, so it must intersect the circle at two points. Therefore, there must be another intersection point. However, the only other point mentioned on the circle connected to S is R, but R is on line SR, which is tangent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe line SU passes through another point on the circle besides U. For example, if line SU intersects the circle at U and another point, say, maybe T? Wait, but line TU is separate. Wait, unless points T and U are both on line SU?

Wait, the line SU connects S to U. If T is also on line SU, then line SU would pass through T and U. But according to the given, there's a line TU. So if T is on line SU, then line TU would be part of line SU. Let me visualize this.

Suppose S is outside the circle. Lines SR and ST are drawn. Wait, no, the lines given are:

Lines:

- Line(S,R): tangent to circle at R.
- Line(S,T): ?
- Line(S,U): secant.
- Line(T,U): ?

Additionally, points T, U, R are on the circle.

If line SU is a secant, then it must pass through two points on the circle. Since U is one, maybe T is another? But T is on the circle, so if line SU passes through T and U, then line SU contains both T and U. Therefore, line SU would go through S, then T, then U? Or S, then U, then T?

Wait, but the line SU connects S and U. If T is on that line, then T lies between S and U, or U and S. Let me consider that possibility.

Assuming that line SU passes through T. So the order could be S---T---U, with T between S and U. Then line SU would intersect the circle at T and U, making it a secant. In that case, the power of point S with respect to the circle would be ST * SU = (length of tangent from S to circle)^2.

Wait, yes! The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point S outside a circle, if a line through S intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then SX * SY is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from S to the circle.

In this case, line SU passes through T and U, which are both on the circle. Therefore, the power of point S with respect to the circle is ST * SU = (tangent length)^2.

But the tangent from S to the circle is SR, since line SR is tangent. Therefore, the power of S is SR^2. Hence, ST * SU = SR^2.

Therefore, using the given lengths:

ST = 5, SU = ST + TU = 5 + x (because SU is from S to U, and TU is from T to U; if T is between S and U, then SU = ST + TU).

Thus, substituting into the equation:

ST * SU = SR²  
=> 5*(5 + x) = 9²  
=> 5*(5 + x) = 81  
=> 25 + 5x = 81  
=> 5x = 56  
=> x = 56 / 5 = 11.2

So x is 11.2, which matches option C (11.2). Therefore, the answer should be C.

Wait, but I need to make sure that my assumption that line SU passes through T is valid. How do I know that T lies on line SU?

Looking back at the given constraints: There is a line TU. So points T and U are connected by a line. But if line SU is a secant passing through T and U, then line TU is part of line SU. Therefore, line TU is the same as line SU. But that would mean that points T, U, and S are colinear. But how can we confirm that?

Well, given that line SU is a secant, passing through two points on the circle, which are T and U. Therefore, T must lie on line SU. Otherwise, line SU wouldn't pass through T. So the fact that line TU exists suggests that T and U are connected, and if line SU is a secant, then T is on line SU. Thus, the points S, T, U are colinear with T between S and U.

Therefore, the Power of a Point applies here. So the calculation above holds, leading us to x=11.2, which is option C.

I don't see any errors in this reasoning. The key was recognizing that line SU being a secant implies that it passes through two points on the circle, which are T and U, hence allowing the application of the power of a point theorem. Then solving gives x=11.2. So the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem using the **Power of a Point Theorem**. This theorem relates the distances from a point outside a circle to various intersections with the circle via secant and tangent lines.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

We are told the following:

- **Points**: $ S, T, U, R $ lie in the plane, and $ A $ is the center of a circle.
- **Lines**:
  - $ \text{Line}(S, R) $ is **tangent** to the circle at point $ R $.
  - $ \text{Line}(S, U) $ is a **secant**, intersecting the circle at points $ T $ and $ U $.
  - $ \text{Line}(T, U) $ connects two points on the circle.
- **Circle Constraints**:
  - $ R, T, U $ lie on the circle centered at $ A $.
  - $ \text{Line}(S, R) $ is tangent to the circle at $ R $.
  - $ \text{Line}(S, U) $ is a secant passing through points $ T $ and $ U $ (both on the circle).

From these observations, we infer that the line segment $ SU $ intersects the circle at two points: $ T $ and $ U $. This makes $ SU $ a **secant**, and thus, the **Power of a Point Theorem** applies at point $ S $.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Power of a Point Theorem

According to the **Power of a Point Theorem**, if a line through point $ S $ intersects the circle at two points $ T $ and $ U $, then:

$$
\text{Power of } S = ST \cdot SU
$$

This power is also equal to the square of the length of the **tangent** from point $ S $ to the circle, which in this case is the line segment $ SR $, because it is explicitly stated that $ \text{Line}(S, R) $ is tangent to the circle at $ R $.

Thus,

$$
ST \cdot SU = SR^2
$$

Now substitute the known values:

- $ ST = 5 $
- $ SR = 9 $
- $ SU = ST + TU = 5 + x $

So:

$$
5(5 + x) = 9^2 \\
5(5 + x) = 81 \\
25 + 5x = 81 \\
5x = 56 \\
x = \frac{56}{5} = 11.2
$$

---

### Final Result

Since the question asks for the value of $ x $ to the nearest tenth, our calculation yields $ x = 11.2 $, which corresponds to **option C**.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
