MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this pentagon angle problem. So, we have a pentagon EFGHJ, right? And there are several angles given in terms of x. The question is asking for the measure of angle H, which I think refers to angle G,H,J, since that's the angle at point H. Wait, no—wait, angle H would be the angle at vertex H. Let me check the labels again.

The points are E, F, G, H, J. The angles mentioned are:

- Angle(F,E,J) which is the angle at E between F and J. So that's angle E.
- Angle(E,F,G) which is angle at F between E and G. That's angle F.
- Angle(F,G,H) is angle at G between F and H. That's angle G.
- Angle(G,H,J) is angle at H between G and J. So that's angle H.
- Angle(H,J,E) is angle at J between H and E. That's angle J.

So the five angles of the pentagon are at each vertex: E, F, G, H, J. Each of these angles has been expressed in terms of x. Then the sum of all these angles equals 540 degrees, which makes sense because the sum of interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. 

Let me write down each angle:

1. Measure of angle at E (which is angle F-E-J): given as x. Wait, wait, the first line says MeasureOf(Angle(F,E,J), Add(x,20))? Wait no, let me check again.

Wait, looking back:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,G), Add(x,20)) – so angle at F (since it's E-F-G). So angle F is x + 20?

Wait, hold on. Let me parse each measure correctly.

Original problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,G), Add(x,20)): So angle EFG (at point F) measures x+20.

Then MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H), Add(x,5)): angle FGH (at point G) is x+5.

MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J), Sub(x,5)): angle GHJ (at point H) is x-5.

MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,E), Add(x,10)): angle HJE (at point J) is x+10.

MeasureOf(Angle(F,E,J), x): angle FEJ (at point E) is x.

Wait, but then the fifth angle is angle at E, which is angle F-E-J. So that's angle E.

So the five angles are:

At E: x

At F: x + 20

At G: x + 5

At H: x - 5

At J: x + 10

And their sum should equal 540 degrees.

So adding them up:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 5) + (x - 5) + (x + 10) = 540.

Let me compute that:

Combine like terms:

x + x + 20 + x + 5 + x -5 + x +10.

Adding the x terms: 1x +1x +1x +1x +1x = 5x.

Now constants: 20 +5 -5 +10 = 20 + 5 is 25, minus 5 is 20, plus 10 is 30.

So total equation: 5x + 30 = 540.

Subtract 30: 5x = 510.

Divide by 5: x = 102.

Wait, so x is 102 degrees.

But the question asks for m∠H. Which is angle at H, which was given as x - 5. Therefore, substituting x=102, angle H is 102 - 5 = 97 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, option A is 97. However, wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes angles can be tricky.

Wait, let me confirm again:

Sum of angles:

At E: x

At F: x + 20

At G: x +5

At H: x -5

At J: x +10

Total sum: x + (x+20)+(x+5)+(x-5)+(x+10) = 5x + 20 +5 -5 +10 = 5x + 30. Correct.

Set equal to 540:

5x +30 = 540 → 5x = 510 → x=102. Correct.

Therefore, angle H is x -5 = 102 -5 = 97 degrees. So answer A is 97. But wait, answer choices include A as 97, so why is that? Let me check if I misread the angle labels.

Wait, angle H is the third angle listed here: angle(G,H,J) which is angle at H. Yes. So that's correct.

But let me check if maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the angles. For example, could angle H be another angle? Let me re-express:

The angles are:

Angle(E,F,G) is angle at F.

Angle(F,G,H) is angle at G.

Angle(G,H,J) is angle at H.

Angle(H,J,E) is angle at J.

Angle(F,E,J) is angle at E.

Yes. So angle H is indeed angle at H, which is angle(G,H,J) which is x -5. So yes, 102-5=97. So answer A.

But wait, answer choices include A as 97. However, sometimes problems might have different configurations. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the sum is 540, which is correct for a pentagon. So the calculation seems correct. Maybe the answer is A. But let me check again if I made a mistake in assigning which angle corresponds to which variable.

Alternatively, perhaps angle H is referring to something else? Like, maybe angle H is not the internal angle? But the problem mentions "measure of angle(...)" so those are internal angles. Because in a polygon, the angles considered are internal unless specified otherwise.

Another way to check: if x=102, then angles are:

E: 102°

F: 102+20=122°

G: 102+5=107°

H: 102-5=97°

J: 102+10=112°

Sum: 102 + 122 + 107 +97 +112 = Let's add them:

First two: 102 + 122 = 224

Next: 224 + 107 = 331

Then +97: 331 +97=428

Then +112: 428 +112=540. Perfect, matches. So angle H is 97°, which is answer A.

But looking at the answer choices, option A is 97. So that's the answer. But wait, the options are:

A. 97

B. 102

C. 107

D. 122

So answer A is 97. But let me check again if maybe the problem had a typo or I misread. Wait, the user wrote:

MeasureOf(Angle(F,E,J), x). So angle(F,E,J) is angle at E. So that's angle E, which is x. Then the rest are angles at F, G, H, J. So that's correct. So angle H is x -5, which is 97. So answer A.

Hmm. But I remember sometimes in some contexts, especially if the pentagon is not convex, the angles could be reflex angles, but the problem didn't mention anything about that. Also, all the angles computed here are positive. For instance, angle at H is 97°, which is fine. All angles are less than 180°, so it's a convex pentagon. So that's okay.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 97. So Final Answer: A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle H$ in the pentagon $EFGHJ$, we start by analyzing the given information and applying the fundamental property of polygons: **the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $(n-2)\times 180^\circ$**. Since this is a pentagon ($n=5$):

$$
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
$$

---

### Step 1: Assign Variables Based on Given Expressions

We are told the measures of the angles in terms of a variable $x$. These expressions correspond to the respective interior angles at vertices $E, F, G, H,$ and $J$:

- $\angle E = x$
- $\angle F = x + 20^\circ$
- $\angle G = x + 5^\circ$
- $\angle H = x - 5^\circ$
- $\angle J = x + 10^\circ$

---

### Step 2: Sum the Angles and Solve for $x$

Using the fact that the total sum of the interior angles is $540^\circ$, set up the equation:

$$
x + (x + 20) + (x + 5) + (x - 5) + (x + 10) = 540
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:

$$
x + x + 20 + x + 5 + x - 5 + x + 10 = 5x + 30
$$

Set equal to 540:

$$
5x + 30 = 540
$$

$$
5x = 510
$$

$$
x = 102
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the Measure of $\angle H$

From earlier, $\angle H = x - 5^\circ$. Substitute $x = 102^\circ$:

$$
\angle H = 102 - 5 = 97^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$

Final Answer: A
