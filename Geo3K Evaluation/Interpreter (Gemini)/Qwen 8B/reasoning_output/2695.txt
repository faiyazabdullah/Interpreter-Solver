MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the measure of arc LP. So first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing all the given information.

We have points M, L, N, P, B. There's a circle centered at B, so B is the center. Points L, N, and P lie on this circle because they're stated as lying on Circle(B). Then there are lines: ML, MN, MP, NP. Also, line ML is tangent to the circle at point L, which means that ML touches the circle only at L and is perpendicular to the radius BL. 

Then, line MN is a secant, meaning it passes through the circle, intersecting it at two points. Since N is on the circle, maybe MN starts at M outside the circle, goes through N (which is on the circle) and perhaps another intersection? Wait, but since N is on the circle, maybe MN intersects the circle at N and another point? But we don't know about another point here. Hmm. 

Also, angles are given: angle at N between MNL is 78 degrees, and angle at M between LMN is 36 degrees. Wait, the Angle(M,N,L) measures 78°, which would be angle at N between points M, N, L. And Angle(L,M,N) is 36°, which is angle at M between points L, M, N. 

So triangle LMN has angles at N being 78°, at M being 36°, and then the third angle at L would be... Well, sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angle at L would be 180 - 78 - 36 = 66°. Wait, but I need to check if that applies here. Wait, angle at N is angle MNL, which is part of triangle MNL. So yes, triangle MNL with angles at M=36°, at N=78°, so angle at L is 66°. 

Now, since ML is tangent to the circle at L, then by the Tangent-Secant theorem, the angle between tangent ML and chord LN should be equal to the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the arc LN. Wait, but in this case, ML is tangent at L, and line LN is a chord? Wait, point N is also on the circle. So line LN connects L and N, both on the circle. Therefore, angle between tangent ML and chord LN is equal to half the measure of arc LN. 

Wait, the formula says that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. So angle between tangent ML and chord LN is equal to half the measure of arc LN. That angle would be angle between ML and LN, which is angle at L between ML and LN. Wait, but in our case, angle at M between LM and MN is 36°, which might relate to something else. Wait, let me clarify.

Let me recall the exact theorem: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, if we have tangent ML at point L, and chord LN (since N is another point on the circle), then angle between ML and LN is equal to half the measure of arc LN. However, angle between ML and LN is actually angle at L, which would be angle MLN. Wait, but in our given data, angle at M is 36°, which is angle L M N. So maybe I need to consider different angles here.

Alternatively, since ML is tangent at L, then BL is the radius perpendicular to ML. So BL ⊥ ML. So triangle BLM is right-angled at L. But I'm not sure yet how that helps directly. 

But back to the angle between tangent ML and chord LN. That angle would be ∠MLN, which is the angle at L between ML and LN. Wait, but in the given data, we have angle at M between LM and MN, which is 36°, and angle at N between MN and NL, which is 78°. Maybe using those angles can help us find some arcs.

Alternatively, since points L, N, P are on the circle, and there's an arc LP mentioned. We need to find the measure of arc LP. Also, there's an arc NL mentioned, so maybe that's related.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me imagine circle with center B. Points L, N, P on circumference. Line ML is tangent at L, so ML touches the circle only at L. Point M is outside the circle. Lines MN and MP connect M to N and P. Line MN is a secant, so it passes through the circle. Since N is on the circle, and assuming that line MN passes through another point, but since P is another point on the circle connected via line MP. Not sure yet.

Given angles:

At point N: angle MNL is 78°, which is angle between MN and NL. At point M: angle LMN is 36°, which is angle between LM and MN. 

In triangle MNL, angles at M = 36°, at N = 78°, so angle at L = 66°. Now, angle at L in triangle MNL is ∠MLN = 66°. This angle is formed by tangent ML and chord LN. According to the tangent-chord angle theorem, this angle (∠MLN) should be equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc LN. So:

∠MLN = ½ * measure of arc LN => 66° = ½ * arc LN => arc LN = 132°.

Therefore, arc LN measures 132°. 

Now, we need to find measure of arc LP. How does arc LP relate to other arcs?

We also have point P on the circle. There's line MP, which connects M to P. Also, line NP connects N to P. The problem mentions arc LP and arc NL. Wait, arc NL is already determined as 132°, but how about arc LP?

Maybe we can find other arcs using the angles. For example, considering the angles involving point P.

But first, let me note down known arcs:

arc LN = 132°, as established.

Since points L, N, P are on the circle, we can think about the positions. If we can find more arcs or relations, we can determine arc LP.

Another thing to consider is that line MP is a line from M to P. Is MP a tangent or secant? The problem states that line MP isn't specified as tangent or secant, but since P is on the circle, line MP would pass through P, so it's a secant if it intersects the circle again. But unless there's another intersection point, but since M is outside the circle, line MP could be a secant passing through P and another point. However, without more info, maybe not helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe looking at angles involving point P. For instance, angle at N between NP and NL? Or maybe triangle NPL?

Wait, the problem mentions Arc(N,L), which might mean arc from N to L, which we already have as 132°. So arc NL is 132°, which is the same as arc LN.

Now, the question is about arc LP. Let me see if there's a way to relate arc LP with other arcs. Since points L, N, P are on the circle, depending on their order, arc LP could be arc LP going through N or not. But since arc NL is 132°, if we can find arc NP or something similar.

Alternatively, since line NP is present, connecting N and P. Maybe there's an inscribed angle or something related.

Alternatively, maybe using power of a point for point M. Since ML is tangent to the circle at L, then power of point M with respect to circle B is ML² = MN * MP. Because for a tangent and a secant from the same external point, the square of the tangent equals the product of the entire secant segment and its external part.

So, ML² = MN * MP. But do we know lengths? Probably not. However, maybe we can use angles to find ratios?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me think again about angles.

Earlier, we had angle at L in triangle MNL is 66°, which relates to arc LN being 132°. Now, if we can find another angle that relates to arc LP.

Looking at the given angles, angle at M between LM and MN is 36°, which is ∠LMN = 36°. Perhaps using that with some other theorem.

Alternatively, since line MP is connected to P, and P is on the circle. Suppose we can find angle at M between LM and MP, which might relate to arc LP. But we don't have that angle given directly. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles involving P.

Wait, the problem also mentions arc LP. So maybe arc LP is related to some inscribed angle. For example, if there's an inscribed angle subtending arc LP, its measure would be half of arc LP.

Alternatively, if we can find the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts arc LP, then double it to get the arc measure.

But how to find such an angle?

Alternatively, since points L, N, P are on the circle, maybe considering quadrilateral or triangles involving these points.

Let me think about triangle MNP. Wait, we know points M, N, P. Line MN is a secant, line MP is another secant. But we don't know much about angles at P or anything else.

Wait, but maybe there's something with the angles at point M. We know angle LMN is 36°, and if we can find angle PMN, then we could find angle LMP, which might relate to arc LP.

But how?

Alternatively, since ML is tangent at L, and MP is a secant, then maybe applying the tangent-secant angle theorem again. The angle between tangent ML and secant MP would be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, the formula is: the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Yes! So, angle between tangent ML and secant MP would be equal to ½*(measure of arc LP - measure of arc LN). Wait, no, depends on which arcs are intercepted. Let me recall the exact statement.

The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if the tangent is ML and the secant is MP, then the angle at M between them would be ½*(measure of arc LP - measure of arc LN). Wait, but which arcs?

Actually, when you have a tangent and a secant from the same external point, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The larger arc minus the smaller arc. In this case, the angle at M between tangent ML and secant MP intercepts arcs from L to P and from L to ... wait, the secant MP goes from M through P to the circle, so it intercepts arc from L to P, but since the tangent is at L, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from L to P that's opposite the angle, and the arc from L to the other side? Wait, perhaps I need to draw it mentally.

Imagine point M outside the circle. From M, there is a tangent ML touching at L, and a secant MP passing through P (another point on the circle). The angle between ML and MP is at M. This angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from L to P that doesn't contain the point where the secant meets the circle again (but since the secant is MP, it meets the circle at P and possibly another point? Wait, if MP is just a single secant, it would enter the circle at P and exit at another point? Wait, but since M is outside the circle and P is on the circle, the line MP starts at M, passes through P, and exits the circle at P? No, if P is on the circle, then MP is a secant that starts at M, enters the circle at P, and ends at P. Wait, no—actually, a secant must intersect the circle at two points. But since P is one point, maybe the line MP intersects the circle at P and another point? Unless MP is tangent, but P is on the circle. Wait, but MP is a line from M to P, where P is on the circle, so it's a secant that starts at M outside the circle and intersects the circle at P. But since it's a secant, it should intersect at two points. So, unless P is the only intersection point, which would make it a tangent, but P is on the circle. Therefore, line MP must intersect the circle at P and another point. But we aren't told about that second point. However, since there's also point N on the circle, maybe line MP intersects the circle at P and another point, say Q? But we don't have info on that. 

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let me go back.

We know that angle at M between LM and MN is 36°, which was used earlier. Also, angle at N between MN and NL is 78°, leading to arc LN being 132°. Now, perhaps using the fact that angle at M between ML and MP is something, which would relate to arc LP. 

But how do we find that angle? If we can find angle between ML and MP, then apply the tangent-secant theorem. But how?

Wait, maybe triangle MNP? If we can find angles at M or somewhere else. Wait, but we don't have direct info about angles involving P. However, we might be able to find relationships using cyclic quadrilaterals or other properties.

Alternatively, since points L, N, P are on the circle, maybe the arcs add up. For example, if we can find arc LP, we might relate it to arc LN plus arc NP or something like that. 

Wait, if we assume that the points L, N, P are arranged on the circle in order, then arc LP would be arc LN + arc NP. But without knowing the position of P relative to L and N, this is uncertain. However, given that there's an arc NL (from N to L) of 132°, and we need arc LP, maybe there's a way to find arc NP or something else.

Alternatively, since line NP connects N to P, which are both on the circle. If we can find the angle subtended by NP, but again, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the angles in triangle MNL and see if we can find more relations. Earlier, we found that angle at L (∠MLN) is 66°, which gives arc LN = 132°. Now, if we can find another angle related to arc LP.

Alternatively, consider triangle MNP. If we can find some angles in this triangle, maybe using the fact that points N and P are on the circle. But again, without more info on angles at P or other points, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that line MP is a secant. Let me consider the power of point M with respect to circle B. Power of a point M is equal to ML² = MN * MP. 

If I can express MN and MP in terms of each other, but without actual lengths, maybe using trigonometry?

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangle MNL. In triangle MNL, we know angles:

∠M = 36°, ∠N = 78°, ∠L = 66°. Let me denote sides:

Using Law of Sines,

ML / sin(∠N) = MN / sin(∠L) = NL / sin(∠M).

So ML / sin(78°) = MN / sin(66°) = NL / sin(36°).

Let me compute ratios. Let’s assign variables:

Let’s let ML = x, MN = y, NL = z.

From above:

x / sin(78°) = y / sin(66°) = z / sin(36°).

But I’m not sure if this helps directly. However, if I can relate these to the power of point M.

Power of point M: ML² = MN * MP.

So, if I can find MP in terms of ML or MN, then maybe...

But without knowing specific lengths, perhaps I need to find a relation between the angles. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle MNL to find relations between sides?

Alternatively, think about the fact that arc LN is 132°, so central angle over arc LN is 132°, which implies that angle at center B for arc LN is 132°. Thus, triangle BLN has angle at B of 132°, making it an isosceles triangle with BL = BN (radii of the circle). Therefore, base angles at L and N are equal. Wait, but BL and BN are radii, so triangle BLN is isosceles with BL = BN. Hence, angles at L and N are equal. Wait, angle at B is 132°, so the sum of angles at L and N is 180 - 132 = 48°, so each is 24°. Therefore, angles ∠BLN and ∠BNL are each 24°. 

But how does this relate to other parts of the diagram? 

Wait, ∠BLN is 24°, which is the angle at L between BL and LN. But BL is the radius, and ML is tangent at L, so BL ⊥ ML. Therefore, angle between BL and ML is 90°. So, if ∠BLN is 24°, then angle between ML and LN is ∠MLN = ∠MLB - ∠BLN? Wait, let me visualize. 

At point L, we have tangent ML and radius BL. The angle between ML and BL is 90°. Also, we have line LN, which makes an angle ∠BLN = 24° with BL. Therefore, the angle between ML and LN would be ∠MLB - ∠BLN = 90° - 24° = 66°, which matches our previous calculation that ∠MLN = 66°, confirming consistency. 

So far, everything checks out. 

Now, returning to the main goal: finding measure of arc LP. 

Perhaps we can find another angle related to arc LP. Let me think about other angles involving point P. 

There's line MP, which connects M to P. If I can find the angle between ML and MP, then using the tangent-secant angle theorem, that angle would be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, the angle between tangent ML and secant MP would be equal to ½(measure of arc LP - measure of arc LN). 

Wait, the formula is: the measure of the angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, if we let θ be the angle between ML and MP at point M, then θ = ½(arc LP - arc LN). 

If we can find θ, then we can solve for arc LP.

But how to find θ? θ is the angle between ML and MP at point M. To find this angle, perhaps we can consider triangle MNP or other triangles. 

But we need more information. Let me think. 

We know angle at M between LM and MN is 36°, and if we can find angle between MN and MP, then θ would be angle between ML and MP = angle between ML and MN + angle between MN and MP, or something like that. 

Assuming that points N and P are positioned such that MP is extending from M through P, and MN is another line from M. Depending on the configuration, angle between ML and MP could be related to angle between ML and MN plus some other angle. 

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. But maybe there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since points L, N, P are on the circle, and we know arc LN is 132°, maybe we can find arc NP or arc LP using other angles. 

Let me think about triangle MNP. If we can find angles at M, N, or P, we might be able to relate them to arcs. 

But we don't have enough info about triangle MNP. However, we know that line MP is a secant. 

Wait, but earlier, we considered the angle between tangent ML and secant MP. If we can find that angle, then we can relate it to arc LP. 

To find that angle, we need to find angle between ML and MP. Let me consider that. 

Let me denote angle between ML and MP as α. Then, according to the tangent-secant theorem:

α = ½(arc LP - arc LN)

We need to find α. 

How can we find α? If we can find another expression for α, using known angles. 

Note that angle between ML and MP is the same as angle between ML and MN plus angle between MN and MP, assuming P is located such that MP extends beyond N or not. 

But we don't know the exact location of P. However, since there's an arc NL (from N to L) and we need arc LP, maybe P is positioned such that arc LP is adjacent to arc LN? 

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle MNP. Let me suppose that after constructing line MP, which goes from M through P to the circle, and since line MN is already there, perhaps angle between MN and MP is something we can find. 

Wait, but without additional info, this seems tricky. Maybe there's another way. 

Let me think about the total circumference. The full circle is 360°, so if we can find other arcs, we can subtract to find arc LP. 

We know arc LN is 132°, so if we can find arc NP or other arcs, we can find arc LP. 

But how? 

Wait, maybe considering the angles at point N. We know angle at N between MN and NL is 78°, which is ∠MNL = 78°. This angle is an inscribed angle? No, because point M is outside the circle. Wait, but ∠MNL is formed by chords NM and NL. Wait, point N is on the circle, and points M and L are outside and on the circle respectively. So ∠MNL is an angle formed by two chords: NM and NL. 

Wait, since N is on the circle, and L is also on the circle, then NL is a chord, and NM is a secant (since M is outside). So, angle at N between NM and NL is an angle formed by a secant and a chord. 

The measure of such an angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, yes! The formula for an angle formed by a secant and a chord is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, ∠MNL is formed by secant NM and chord NL. The intercepted arcs are arc NL and arc... the other arc that's opposite. Since the angle is at N, the intercepted arcs would be arc from L to P? Wait, no. Let me recall the exact rule.

When an angle is formed by a secant and a chord at a point on the circle, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, no. Wait, if the vertex is on the circle, and one side is a chord and the other is a secant, then the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, in this case, ∠MNL has vertex at N, with one side being NL (a chord) and the other side being NM (a secant). The intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite the angle, which would be arc from L to the other intersection of the secant NM with the circle. But since N is on the circle, and the secant NM starts at N and goes through M outside the circle. Wait, but the secant NM intersects the circle at N and another point? Wait, since M is outside the circle, and line NM connects N (on the circle) to M (outside), so the secant NM intersects the circle only at N. Wait, but that contradicts the definition of a secant, which requires two intersections. So, maybe the secant is actually line NM extended beyond N to meet the circle again? No, because N is already on the circle. 

Wait, this suggests that my initial assumption may be wrong. Let me re-examine the problem. 

The problem states that Line(M,N) is a secant. A secant line intersects the circle at two points. Since point N is on the circle, and M is outside, then line MN must intersect the circle at another point besides N. So, there must be another intersection point. Let's call it Q. But since the problem didn't mention Q, maybe it's implied that line MN intersects the circle at N and another point, but since we have point P also on the circle, maybe that other intersection is P? Or maybe not. 

Wait, the problem mentions points L, N, P on the circle. Line MN is a secant, so it passes through two points on the circle. One of them is N, so the other must be another point. It could be P or another point. But since there's also point P, maybe line MN intersects the circle at N and P? Or maybe at N and another point. Without more info, it's hard to tell. 

But let's assume that line MN intersects the circle at N and another point, say Q. But since we have point P, maybe Q is P? Or maybe not. This uncertainty complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe line MP intersects the circle at P and another point, and line NP connects N to P. 

This is getting too vague. Let me try another approach. 

We know arc LN is 132°, and we need arc LP. Suppose that arc LP is composed of arc LN (132°) plus arc NP. If I can find arc NP, then adding to 132° would give arc LP. 

But how to find arc NP? 

Looking back at the angles, perhaps considering triangle MNP. If I can find angles at N or P, then use those to find arcs. 

Alternatively, since we have angle at N between MN and NL is 78°, which we've already used. 

Wait, but if line MN is a secant intersecting the circle at N and another point, say Q, then the angle ∠MNL (at N between MN and NL) would be equal to half the difference of the arcs intercepted by the secant and the chord. 

Specifically, the angle formed by a secant and a chord is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from L to Q (the other intersection point of the secant) and the arc from L to N. Wait, but since the angle is at N, the intercepted arcs would be the arc that's inside the angle and the arc that's outside. 

Wait, the formula is: the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if the angle is formed by a secant and a chord, then the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, in this case, ∠MNL is formed by secant NM (intersecting the circle at N and Q) and chord NL. The intercepted arcs would be arc from L to Q and arc from L to N. Wait, but since the angle is at N, the intercepted arcs are the arc that is opposite the angle, which would be arc from L to Q, and the arc from L to N. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Let me refer to the standard formula: When an angle is formed by a secant and a chord at a point on the circle, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, no, that's when the angle is formed by two chords. 

Wait, confusion arises. Let me look up the exact formula. 

[Imagining recalling] An angle formed by a secant and a chord at a point on the circle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, but in this case, ∠MNL is formed by secant NM and chord NL. Since N is on the circle, and NL is a chord, while NM is a secant. So the intercepted arc would be the arc from L to the other intersection point of the secant NM with the circle. 

Wait, since the secant NM passes through N and extends to M outside, it intersects the circle at N and another point. Let's call that point Q. Then, the intercepted arc would be arc from L to Q. 

Thus, measure of ∠MNL = ½ * measure of arc LQ. 

But we know ∠MNL = 78°, so 78° = ½ * arc LQ → arc LQ = 156°. 

Now, arc LQ is the arc from L to Q, where Q is the other intersection of line NM with the circle. 

But we don't know where Q is, but maybe Q is point P? Or another point? 

If we assume that Q is point P, then arc LP would be arc LQ = 156°, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, if Q is another point, but since we have point P, maybe there's a relation. 

Alternatively, if arc LQ is 156°, and arc LN is 132°, then depending on the position of Q relative to L and N, arc LQ could be arc LN + arc NQ or arc LQ = arc LN - arc NQ, depending on direction. 

But this is speculative. However, if we assume that Q is point P, then arc LP would be arc LQ = 156°, which would be the answer. But let's check if that makes sense. 

If arc LP is 156°, then the answer would be option D (156). But let me verify if this assumption holds. 

But why would Q be point P? Because line MN is a secant, and point P is another point on the circle. If line MN intersects the circle at N and P, then Q would be P. So, if that's the case, then arc LP would be arc from L to P, which is the same as arc LQ, which is 156°. 

But earlier, we had arc LN = 132°, so if arc LP is 156°, then arc NP would be arc LP - arc LN = 156° - 132° = 24°. 

Is there a way to confirm this? 

Let me think. If arc NP is 24°, then the central angle for arc NP is 24°, so the angle at center B for arc NP is 24°, implying that triangle BNP is isosceles with BN = BP (radii), so angles at N and P are equal. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Alternatively, maybe there's another angle that corresponds to arc NP. 

But without more info, it's hard to verify. However, if we proceed under the assumption that arc LP is 156°, which is option D, then that would be the answer. 

But let me cross-check with another method. 

Earlier, we had angle between tangent ML and secant MP is α = ½(arc LP - arc LN). If we can find α, then we can solve for arc LP. 

To find α, the angle between ML and MP at point M, let's consider that angle at M between ML and MN is 36°, and if we can find angle between MN and MP, then α = 36° + angle between MN and MP, or something like that. 

But how to find angle between MN and MP? 

If line MN intersects the circle at N and Q (point P?), then the angle between MN and MP would depend on the position of P. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle MNP, and if we can find angles at M or N. 

But we don't have enough info. 

Wait, but earlier we found that arc LQ = 156°, assuming Q is P. If arc LP = 156°, then arc LQ = arc LP = 156°, which would mean that point Q is P. Hence, line MN intersects the circle at N and P. So, arc LP is 156°, which would be the answer. 

But let me check if this makes sense with other angles. 

If arc LP is 156°, then the central angle over arc LP is 156°, and if we consider the inscribed angle subtended by this arc, it would be 78°, which is the angle at the circumference. But where would that angle be? 

For example, if there is a point on the circle such that the angle subtended by LP is 78°, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since we had earlier that angle at N between MN and NL is 78°, which gave arc LQ = 156°, and if that arc LQ is LP, then it fits. 

Therefore, this suggests that arc LP is 156°, making the answer D. 

But let me check if there's another way to arrive at this. 

Earlier, we had from the angle at N: ∠MNL = 78° = ½(arc LQ), giving arc LQ = 156°. If Q is P, then arc LP = 156°. 

Alternatively, if we consider the tangent-secant angle at M between ML and MP: α = ½(arc LP - arc LN) = ½(156 - 132) = ½(24) = 12°. 

But how to find α? If α is 12°, then angle between ML and MP is 12°, which would mean that angle between ML and MP is 12°. 

But how to find this angle? 

If we consider triangle MNL and triangle MLP, but without more info, it's hard. 

However, if we assume that arc LP is 156°, then this leads to α = 12°, which might be consistent with other angles. 

Alternatively, if we consider the total angles around point M. 

At point M, we have several lines: ML, MN, MP. We know angle between ML and MN is 36°, and if angle between ML and MP is α, then angle between MN and MP would be α - 36°, assuming P is on the same side as N relative to ML. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

However, given that the arc LN is 132°, and through the angle at N, we derived arc LQ = 156°, and assuming Q is P, giving arc LP = 156°, which matches one of the answer choices (D), it seems plausible. 

Additionally, checking the other answer choices: if arc LP were 144°, then α = ½(144 - 132) = 6°, which seems small. If it were 114°, then α = ½(114 - 132) = -9°, which is impossible. So 156° is the only feasible value that gives positive α. 

Hence, the measure of arc LP is 156°, corresponding to option D.

To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{LP} $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric setup and applying key theorems related to circles and tangents.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Given Constraints

We are given a circle with center $ B $, and three points $ L, N, P $ lying on the circle. Additionally, we know the following:

- **Line $ ML $** is tangent to the circle at point $ L $.
- **Line $ MN $** is a secant of the circle.
- **Lines $ ML, MN, MP $** originate from point $ M $, which lies outside the circle.
- **Angles at point $ M $ and $ N $**:  
  - $ \angle LNM = 78^\circ $
  - $ \angle LMN = 36^\circ $

These angles form triangle $ \triangle LMN $, allowing us to compute the remaining angle:

$$
\angle MLN = 180^\circ - \angle LNM - \angle LMN = 180^\circ - 78^\circ - 36^\circ = 66^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem

According to the **tangent-chord angle theorem**, the angle between a **tangent** and a **chord** is equal to **half the measure of the arc** intercepted by the chord.

Here, $ ML $ is tangent to the circle at $ L $, and $ LN $ is a chord of the circle. Thus:

$$
\angle MLN = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{arc } LN
$$

Substituting the known value:

$$
66^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{arc } LN \Rightarrow \text{arc } LN = 132^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Angle at Point $ N $ Using the Secant-Chord Theorem

Next, consider the angle $ \angle MNL = 78^\circ $, formed by the **secant** $ MN $ and the **chord** $ NL $. This angle is formed by a secant intersecting the circle at $ N $ and another point (say $ Q $), and the chord $ NL $.

According to the **secant-chord angle theorem**, the measure of this angle is:

$$
\angle MNL = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{arc } LQ - \text{arc } LN)
$$

Plugging in the values:

$$
78^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{arc } LQ - 132^\circ)
\Rightarrow \text{arc } LQ = 156^\circ
$$

Assuming that point $ Q $ coincides with point $ P $ (as both are defined on the circle), then:

$$
\text{arc } LP = \text{arc } LQ = 156^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

The measure of arc $ \widehat{LP} $ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{156}
$$
