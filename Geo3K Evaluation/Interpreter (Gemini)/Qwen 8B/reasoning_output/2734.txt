MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have points A, B, C, D with several lines and angles mentioned. The goal is to find the measure of angle CDA, which is denoted as x. Let me start by listing all the given information and see how they connect.

First, there are points A, B, C, D. Then there are lines: Line(B,A), Line(B,C), Line(C,D). Also, some angles are specified: Angle(C,B,D) which I think is angle at point B between points C and D? Wait, no—angle notation usually is the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(C,B,D) would be the angle at point B formed by points C, B, D. Similarly, Angle(B,C,D) is the angle at point C formed by points B, C, D. Then Angle(C,D,A) is the angle at point D formed by points C, D, A. 

Also, Triangle(C,B,D) is mentioned. So triangle CBD. Then there's an equality that the length of line BC equals the length of line BD. So triangle CBD has sides BC = BD, making it an isosceles triangle. And then another condition says that the measure of angle BCD (which is angle at C, so angle BCD?) Wait, no. Wait, the angles given are:

Angle(B,C,D): This should be angle at point C between points B, C, D. So that's angle BCD. Similarly, Angle(C,D,B) is angle at D between points C, D, B. Wait, but the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,B))). So angle BCD equals angle CDB? Because angle(C,D,B) would be angle at D between C, D, B. So angle CDB. Therefore, since triangle CBD is isosceles with BC=BD, then angles opposite those sides would be equal. Wait, in triangle CBD, BC = BD. So sides BC and BD are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite them would be equal. But wait, side BC is opposite angle at D (angle CDB), and side BD is opposite angle at C (angle BCD). Wait, let me confirm:

In triangle CBD, vertices are C, B, D. So side BC is opposite angle at D (since angle at D is between points C, D, B). Similarly, side BD is opposite angle at C (angle BCD). Since BC = BD, then their opposite angles are equal. So angle at D (CDB) equals angle at C (BCD). Which matches the given condition that measure of angle BCD equals measure of angle CDB. That checks out.

So triangle CBD is isosceles with base CD and legs BC and BD. Wait, no—if BC and BD are equal, then the base is CD, and the two equal sides are BC and BD. Therefore, the base angles at C and D are equal. So angles at C and D are equal. So angle BCD equals angle CDB. So each of these angles is equal. Let me denote angle BCD as θ, so angle CDB is also θ. Then the third angle at B would be 180° - 2θ.

Now, moving on. There's another angle mentioned: Angle(C,D,A), which is angle at D between points C, D, A. So that's angle CDA, which is our target x. Also, there's a condition that Point D lies on line BA. So point D is somewhere along the line connecting B and A. Wait, Line(B,A) is defined, and Point D lies on that line. So D is on line BA. So points B, D, A are colinear. Therefore, line BD is part of line BA. Wait, but earlier we had line BD as part of triangle CBD. So maybe D is between B and A?

Let me sketch mentally. Points B and A are connected by a line. Point D is on line BA. So D could be between B and A, or beyond A or beyond B. But given that there's a line CD, which connects point C to D. Also, there's a line from C to D, and angle CDA is considered. So perhaps D is between B and A. Let me assume that for now.

So, considering that, let me try to visualize. Let me imagine points B and A on a line. Point D is on BA. Then point C is connected to B and to D. Also, triangle CBD is isosceles with BC=BD. So BD is equal to BC. If D is on BA, then BD is a segment from B to D on BA. So BD's length equals BC's length.

Moreover, there's another angle condition: MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)) equals Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D))). Wait, Angle(B,C,D) is angle BCD (at point C), and Angle(C,B,D) is angle CBD (at point B). Wait, hold on. Let me parse the given conditions again.

The problem states:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,B)))

Which was already covered as angle BCD equals angle CDB.

Then:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)), Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D))))

So angle CDA (which is angle at D between C, D, A) equals angle BCD + angle CBD. So angle CDA = angle BCD + angle CBD.

But angle CBD is the angle at point B in triangle CBD. Earlier, we said that in triangle CBD, angles at C and D are both θ, so angle at B is 180 - 2θ. So angle CBD is 180 - 2θ. Wait, but angle CBD is part of the larger picture here.

Wait, angle CBD is the angle at point B between points C, B, D. Which is the same as angle at B in triangle CBD. Which is 180° - 2θ, as above.

But angle CDA (x) is equal to angle BCD (θ) plus angle CBD (180-2θ)? Wait, that would make x = θ + (180 - 2θ) = 180 - θ. Hmm, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which angles are which.

Wait, let me re-express:

Given:

MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)) equals Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D))).

So angle CDA (at D) equals angle BCD (at C) + angle CBD (at B). So angle CDA = angle BCD + angle CBD.

But angle CBD is angle at B, which in triangle CBD is angle at B, which is 180 - 2θ. So substituting, angle CDA = θ + (180 - 2θ) = 180 - θ. However, angle CDA is also part of triangle CDA. Wait, but we need more relations to find θ.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that D lies on BA. So line BA contains points B, D, A. Therefore, points B-D-A are colinear. Therefore, when looking at triangle CDA, point D is on BA. Let me consider coordinates to model this.

Maybe assigning coordinates can help. Let me place point B at origin (0,0). Let me assume line BA is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set coordinate system such that point B is at (0,0), point A is at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Then point D is somewhere on BA, so its coordinates are (d, 0) where d is between 0 and a or outside. Given that BD = BC, and BC is the length from B(0,0) to C. Let me define coordinates for point C. Since triangle CBD is isosceles with BC = BD. Let me suppose that BD is some length, say, k. Then BC is also k.

If point D is on BA, then BD is the distance from B(0,0) to D(d, 0) which is |d|. So BD = |d|. So BC must also be equal to |d|. Let me pick coordinates for C. Suppose point C is located somewhere such that distance from B(0,0) to C(x,y) is |d|. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let me assume that BD = 1 unit for simplicity, so d = 1 or -1. Let me take d = 1, so D is at (1, 0). Then BC = 1, so point C lies somewhere on circle centered at B(0,0) with radius 1. Let me pick coordinates for C. For example, suppose C is at (0,1), forming a right angle? Wait, but then triangle CBD would have points B(0,0), C(0,1), D(1,0). Then BD is length 1, BC is length 1. Then triangle CBD has sides BC = 1, BD = 1, and CD. Let me compute CD. Coordinates of C(0,1), D(1,0). Distance CD is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(2). So triangle CBD is isoceles with BC=BD=1, and base CD=sqrt(2). Then angles at C and D are equal. Let me calculate angle at C (angle BCD). Using coordinates, vectors CB = B - C = (0 - 0, 0 - 1) = (0,-1). Vector CD = D - C = (1 - 0, 0 - 1) = (1,-1). The angle at C between CB and CD. To find angle between vectors CB and CD. The formula is cos(theta) = (CB · CD)/(|CB| |CD|). Compute the dot product: (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1. |CB| is 1, |CD| is sqrt(2). So cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(2), so theta is 45 degrees. Therefore, angle BCD is 45°, which would mean angle CDB is also 45°, and angle at B is 180 - 45 -45 = 90°. So angle CBD is 90°. 

Now, according to the previous equation, angle CDA (x) equals angle BCD (45°) + angle CBD (90°) = 135°. But in this case, what is angle CDA?

Point D is at (1,0), point C is at (0,1), point A is at (a, 0). Let me assume A is at (2,0) for example. Then line DA goes from D(1,0) to A(2,0), so it's along the x-axis. Point C is at (0,1). So angle CDA is the angle at D(1,0) between points C(0,1), D(1,0), A(2,0). So vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 1, 1 - 0) = (-1, 1). Vector DA is from D to A: (2 - 1, 0 - 0) = (1, 0). So angle between vectors DC (-1,1) and DA (1,0). Let me compute this angle. The cosine of the angle is ( (-1)(1) + (1)(0) ) / ( |DC| * |DA| ). The numerator is -1. |DC| is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). |DA| is 1. So cos(theta) = -1 / sqrt(2), which corresponds to an angle of 135°, since cos(135°) = -√2/2 ≈ -0.707. So yes, angle CDA is 135°. However, none of the answer choices include 135°, which suggests either my assumption about coordinates is wrong, or I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the answer choices are A.30, B.60, C.90, D.120. So 135 isn't among them. Therefore, my coordinate assumption might be incorrect. Maybe I chose specific coordinates that don't fit all constraints? Or perhaps there's another configuration.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify whether D is between B and A or extended beyond. In my example, D was between B and A (if A is at (2,0), then D at (1,0) is between B(0,0) and A(2,0)). However, in that case, angle CDA came out as 135°, which is not an option. So perhaps my coordinate setup is invalid because other constraints aren't satisfied?

Wait, but the problem also mentions line(C,D), which is present. Also, there's an angle CDA, which is part of triangle CDA. Are there any other constraints I missed?

Another thing: the problem says PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(B,A)), which we've considered. Also, there's a line from C to D, which we've included. So perhaps my coordinate example is valid, but the answer isn't listed, meaning I may have misapplied something else.

Wait, let me check again. The question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)) which is angle CDA. In my example, that's 135°, but since that's not an option, maybe there's a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps D is not between B and A but beyond A? Let me try that. Let me take D beyond A. Let me reset coordinates. Let me take B at (0,0), A at (1,0), and D at (2,0). Then BD is length 2 units. So BC must be equal to BD, so BC = 2. Let me place point C somewhere such that distance from B(0,0) to C is 2. Let me choose C at (0,2). Then triangle CBD has points B(0,0), C(0,2), D(2,0). Then BD = 2, BC = 2. Then CD is from (0,2) to (2,0), which is sqrt( (2)^2 + (-2)^2 ) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). Angles at C and D are equal. Let me compute angle at C (angle BCD). Vectors CB = (0 - 0, 0 - 2) = (0,-2). Vector CD = (2 - 0, 0 - 2) = (2,-2). Dot product CB · CD = (0)(2) + (-2)(-2) = 4. |CB| = 2, |CD| = sqrt(8). So cos(theta) = 4/(2*sqrt(8)) = 4/(2*2*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2), so theta = 45°, same as before. Thus, angle CBD is 180 - 2*45 = 90°, as before. Now, angle CDA: point D(2,0), point C(0,2), point A(1,0). So angle at D between C, D, A. Vector DC is from D(2,0) to C(0,2): (-2, 2). Vector DA is from D(2,0) to A(1,0): (-1, 0). The angle between vectors DC(-2,2) and DA(-1,0). Compute the cosine: [(-2)(-1) + (2)(0)] / (|DC| * |DA|) = (2 + 0)/(sqrt(8)*1) = 2/(2*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2), which is 45°. Wait, that gives angle CDA as 45°, which is not matching with the previous calculation. Wait, why the difference?

Because in this case, point A is at (1,0), so DA is from D(2,0) to A(1,0), which is leftward. Vector DC is from D to C: (-2, 2). Vector DA is (-1, 0). The angle between (-2, 2) and (-1, 0). Let me calculate it properly. The dot product is (-2)(-1) + (2)(0) = 2. |DC| is sqrt( (-2)^2 + 2^2 ) = sqrt(8). |DA| is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 ) = 1. So cos(theta) = 2 / sqrt(8) = 2/(2*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2), which is 45°, so angle CDA is 45°, which still isn't among the choices. Hmm, conflicting results based on placement of D. What's going on here?

Wait, but the problem says that line(C,D) exists. In both cases, that's true. Also, the angle CDA is computed differently depending on where D is placed. But in both scenarios, the angle CDA comes out as either 45° or 135°, neither of which is in the options. So maybe my approach is missing something?

Wait, let me go back to the original equations. We have angle CDA = angle BCD + angle CBD. From earlier, angle BCD is θ, angle CBD is 180 - 2θ. So angle CDA = θ + (180 - 2θ) = 180 - θ. But angle CDA is also related to other parts of the diagram. Perhaps there's another relation involving triangle CDA?

Let me consider triangle CDA. Points C, D, A. We know that D lies on BA, and we might relate other angles. Also, there's line CD, which connects C to D. Also, there's line from C to D, and line from D to A. Let me think about possible triangles or other relationships.

Alternatively, since D lies on BA, and we have BC = BD, maybe there's some symmetry or reflection involved. For instance, if we reflect point C over the line BA, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in my first example, angle CDA came out as 135°, which is 180 - 45°, where θ = 45°. So if angle CDA = 180 - θ, then θ is 45°, leading to angle CDA = 135°. But since 135 isn't an option, maybe there's another way to express this?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting which angles are which. Let me recheck:

The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)), Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)))). So angle CDA equals angle BCD + angle CBD. As previously established, angle BCD is θ, angle CBD is 180 - 2θ, so total is 180 - θ. Hence, angle CDA = 180 - θ. But what is θ?

In triangle CBD, angles at C and D are θ, and angle at B is 180 - 2θ. But angle at B (CBD) is also part of the larger diagram. Since D is on BA, angle CBD is adjacent to angle ABC, which might be related to other elements.

Wait, but without knowing more about the rest of the diagram, like where point A is relative to other points, it's hard to determine θ. Unless there's another constraint I haven't used yet.

Wait, the problem also includes triangle(C,B,D) and other elements. Is there anything else? Let me check all given constraints again.

Constraints:
- Line(B,A), Line(B,C), Line(C,D)
- Angle(C,B,D) = angle at B, which we've considered
- Angle(B,C,D) = angle at C, which is θ
- Angle(C,D,A) = angle at D, which is x
- Triangle(C,B,D) is isosceles with BC = BD
- Angle(B,C,D) = angle(C,D,B) → confirmed
- Point D lies on line BA

Are there any other constraints? It seems not. So unless there's another relationship involving angle CDA, I might need to find θ through other means.

Wait, but if angle CDA = 180 - θ, and θ is angle BCD, which is part of triangle CBD. But how to find θ?

Perhaps by considering triangle CDA and other relationships. For example, in triangle CDA, we have points C, D, A. We know that D is on BA. Let me consider the sum of angles around point D. Wait, but angle CDA is one angle of triangle CDA. Other angles are at C and A. However, without knowing more about those, it's difficult.

Wait, but maybe there's a straight line or supplementary angles. Since D is on BA, line BA passes through D. So, if I look at line BA, which contains points B, D, A. So, angle at D between C and A is angle CDA. Also, if I consider the line CD, then perhaps some vertical angles or linear pairs?

Alternatively, think about triangle CDA and triangle CBD. Wait, but I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, let's think about the entire diagram. Points B and A are connected, D is on BA. Point C is connected to B and D. So, perhaps triangle CBD is isosceles, and we need to find angle CDA in terms of known quantities.

Wait, but angle CDA = 180 - θ. If we can find θ, then we can get x.

How can we find θ? Well, in triangle CBD, angles at C and D are θ, angle at B is 180 - 2θ. But angle at B is angle CBD, which is part of the larger structure. If we can relate this angle to something else...

Wait, since D is on BA, then line BA extends through D. So, if I consider the line BA, and point C, then perhaps there's a relationship between angle CBD and other angles?

For instance, if we consider triangle ABC or something similar. Wait, but we don't have info about point A except that it's on line BA with D. Let me think about the possibility that line CA forms some relationship. Wait, there's a line from C to D, and point A is on line BA. So, maybe triangle CDA has some relationship with other triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle CBD or elsewhere.

In triangle CBD, BC = BD = let's say length l. Then CD can be found via the Law of Cosines: CD² = BC² + BD² - 2*BC*BD*cos(angle at B). Since BC = BD = l, this becomes CD² = l² + l² - 2*l*l*cos(angle CBD). So CD² = 2l²(1 - cos(angle CBD)). 

But angle CBD is 180 - 2θ, so CD² = 2l²[1 - cos(180 - 2θ)]. Cos(180 - x) = -cos(x), so CD² = 2l²[1 - (-cos(2θ))] = 2l²(1 + cos(2θ)).

But I don't know if this helps directly.

Alternatively, in triangle CDA, if I can relate sides or angles. But without knowing lengths or other angles, it's challenging.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to use the fact that D is on BA. Let me consider extending lines or looking for cyclic quadrilaterals? Not sure.

Wait, let me try assuming that angle CDA is one of the given options and work backwards. Let's say x is 120° (option D). Then from angle CDA = 180 - θ, we have 120 = 180 - θ ⇒ θ = 60°. So angle BCD = 60°, angle CBD = 180 - 2*60 = 60°. So triangle CBD would have angles 60°, 60°, 60°, making it equilateral. Hence, BC = BD = CD. So in that case, if triangle CBD is equilateral, then CD = BC = BD. So if that's the case, then angle CDA = 120°, which would be option D. 

Let me check if this scenario is possible. If triangle CBD is equilateral, then all angles are 60°. So angle CBD is 60°, angle BCD = 60°, angle CDB = 60°. Then, angle CDA = angle BCD + angle CBD = 60 + 60 = 120°, which matches x = 120°. So this fits. 

But why would triangle CBD be equilateral? Because if BC = BD (given), and if angle CBD is 60°, then by Law of Cosines, CD² = BC² + BD² - 2*BC*BD*cos(60°). Since BC = BD = l, this becomes CD² = l² + l² - 2*l²*(0.5) = 2l² - l² = l² → CD = l. So CD = BC = BD, hence equilateral. So this works. 

Therefore, if angle CBD is 60°, then triangle CBD is equilateral, and angle CDA = 120°, which is option D. 

But how do we know angle CBD is 60°? Because from angle CDA = 180 - θ, and if x is 120°, then θ = 60°, leading to angle CBD = 180 - 2*60 = 60°. This creates consistency. 

But why is angle CBD 60°? It depends on the configuration. If there are no other constraints, it's possible. But does the given data enforce this? Let me check if there are any other constraints that force angle CBD to be 60°.

Looking back, the only other constraint is that D lies on line BA. So if we assume that triangle CBD is equilateral, then that satisfies all given conditions: BC=BD, angles at C and D are equal, and angle CDA = 120°. 

But how do we know that this is the only possibility? Could there be other configurations where angle CDA is different?

Suppose angle CBD is not 60°, say, 90°. Then angle BCD = angle CDB = 45°, and angle CDA = 180 - 45 = 135°, which isn't an option. If angle CBD is 30°, then angle BCD = angle CDB = 75°, angle CDA = 180 - 75 = 105°, not an option. If angle CBD is 120°, then angle BCD = angle CDB = (180 - 120)/2 = 30°, so angle CDA = 180 - 30 = 150°, not an option. 

Thus, the only value that leads to an answer choice is when angle CBD is 60°, giving x = 120°, which is option D. 

But how do we justify that angle CBD must be 60°? It seems that the problem allows multiple configurations, but the given constraints might implicitly require it. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any additional constraints, so how can we uniquely determine x?

Ah! Wait, there's another angle mentioned: Angle(C,D,A) is angle CDA, which we're trying to find. But the problem also includes line(C,D), and point A is part of the diagram. Perhaps there's another relationship involving point A?

Wait, the problem says "PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(B,A))", which we've considered. But is there any other condition involving point A? Like, is there a line from A to C or something else? No, the given lines are Line(B,A), Line(B,C), Line(C,D). So no line AC is mentioned. 

However, there's an angle CDA, which is part of triangle CDA. But without more info about triangle CDA, we can't determine it unless we use the earlier equation angle CDA = angle BCD + angle CBD. Which led us to x = 180 - θ. But without knowing θ, we can't proceed. 

Unless there's another relationship involving θ. Wait, let's consider the full diagram. Since D lies on BA, and line CD is drawn, maybe there's a triangle involving point A that relates to other parts. 

Wait, for example, in triangle CDA, we have points C, D, A. We know that D is on BA. If we can find some relationship between angles in triangle CDA and other parts, maybe through vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Wait, angle at D, which is angle CDA, is adjacent to angle CDB (from triangle CBD). Since D is on line BA, the line CD forms two angles at D: one is angle CDB (part of triangle CBD), and the other is angle CDA (the one we're measuring). These two angles form a linear pair along line BA. Wait, no. Because line BA passes through D, and line CD is a separate line. At point D, the angles around it are: angle CDB (between CD and DB), and angle CDA (between CD and DA). Since DB and DA are parts of the same line BA, the sum of angles CDB and CDA should be 180°, because they are adjacent and form a straight line. 

Yes! That's a key insight. At point D, the line CD makes two angles with the line BA: angle CDB (which is θ) and angle CDA (x). Since these two angles are on a straight line, their measures add up to 180°. So:

θ + x = 180°

But from earlier, we had x = 180° - θ. Which confirms this. So θ + x = 180°, hence x = 180° - θ. 

But we also had from the given condition that x = angle BCD + angle CBD = θ + (180° - 2θ) = 180° - θ. So this is consistent. 

But this doesn't give us new information. So how do we find θ?

We need another equation involving θ. Where can it come from? 

Wait, perhaps considering triangle ABC or other triangles. But we don't have much information about point A besides lying on line BA. 

Wait, but there's another angle mentioned: Angle(C,D,A) is x, which we've connected to θ. But is there a way to relate θ to other parts of the diagram? 

Alternatively, since BC = BD, and D is on BA, perhaps triangle BCD is isosceles with BC=BD, and we can use some properties of isosceles triangles combined with the linear pair at D. 

Wait, but we already did that. 

Wait, unless there's a hidden triangle involving point A. For instance, if we consider triangle ACD, or triangle ABC. Let me think about triangle ABC. We know point A is on line BA, but without knowing where A is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to use the fact that angle CDA is x, and angle CDB is θ, and they add to 180°. Also, angle CBD is 180 - 2θ. But how does that help?

Wait, let me think about the entire diagram. Let me imagine that line BA extends infinitely in both directions. Point D is somewhere on BA. Point C is connected to B and D, forming triangle CBD. Then, line CD is drawn. Point A is on line BA, so line DA is part of BA. 

Is there a way to express θ in terms of other angles? 

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle CBD. In triangle CBD, BC = BD = l, and CD = l (if it's equilateral), but otherwise CD varies. But without knowing lengths, it's hard to apply. 

Wait, but if I assume that triangle CBD is equilateral, then θ = 60°, leading to x = 120°, which is option D. And this fits all conditions: BC=BD, angles at C and D are equal, angle CBD = 60°, and angle CDA = 120°. 

Since this is a math competition-style problem, it's likely that the answer is one of the standard angles, and the configuration that fits all conditions is the equilateral triangle case. Hence, x = 120°, option D. 

Therefore, despite initial confusion with coordinate examples, the correct answer is D.
