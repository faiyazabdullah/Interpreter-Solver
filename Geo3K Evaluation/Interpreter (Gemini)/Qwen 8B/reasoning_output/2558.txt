MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So we have an equilateral triangle QRS. Wait, but then there are some equations involving lengths of sides related to x. The question asks for RS, which in an equilateral triangle should all sides be equal. But wait, the problem says that triangle QRS is equilateral, so all sides should be equal. However, the given constraints seem to have different expressions for each side length in terms of x. Let me check again.

The problem states:

- Length of QR is 4x.
- Length of RS is 2x + 1.
- Length of QS is 6x - 1.

But since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. Therefore, QR = RS = QS. So I need to set up equations where these three expressions are equal and solve for x. Then once I find x, I can compute RS (which is 2x + 1) and see which option matches.

So let's write down the equations:

First, QR = RS:

4x = 2x + 1

Subtract 2x from both sides:

2x = 1 => x = 1/2.

Then check if QR equals QS as well. Let's compute QS when x=1/2:

QS = 6*(1/2) -1 = 3 -1 = 2.

QR is 4*(1/2)=2. So yes, QR=QS=2. And RS is 2*(1/2)+1=1+1=2. All sides equal to 2. So RS would be 2. But looking at the answer choices, D is 2. So the answer should be D?

Wait, but let me double-check. Because maybe there's something wrong here. Let me verify again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all sides are equal because it's an equilateral triangle. Wait, the problem says "Equilateral(Triangle(Q,R,S))", so yes, all sides must be equal. Therefore, setting QR = RS and QR = QS gives us equations. Let me re-express:

From QR = RS: 4x = 2x +1 â†’ x= 0.5.

Then RS is 2*(0.5) +1 = 1 +1 = 2. Which is option D. But wait, the answer choices include D as 2. So that would make sense. However, let me check if there's another equation that might affect this. For example, maybe the congruence relations? The problem also mentions Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(R,S)), Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(Q,S)), and Congruent(Line(R,S), Line(Q,S)). These are redundant because if all sides are congruent, then they are all equal. So that's consistent.

Therefore, solving gives x=0.5, so RS = 2x +1 = 2*(0.5) +1 = 2. Hence, the value of RS is 2, which corresponds to option D. So the answer should be D.

But wait, hold on. Let me check again. If x=0.5, then QR is 4x = 2, RS is 2x +1 = 2*0.5 +1 = 2, and QS is 6x -1 = 6*(0.5) -1 = 3 -1 = 2. Yes, all sides equal. So RS is indeed 2. So the answer is D. 

But why is there an option B as 1? Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "Find R S if triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle." Wait, but RS is a line segment, so its length is 2. But the answer choices are numbers. So the answer is D, which is 2. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ RS $ in the equilateral triangle $ \triangle QRS $, we begin by analyzing the relationships between the side lengths expressed in terms of $ x $. Given that the triangle is **equilateral**, all three sides must be equal in length. This provides us with the key constraint:

$$
\text{Length}(QR) = \text{Length}(RS) = \text{Length}(QS)
$$

We are given the following expressions for the side lengths:

- $ \text{Length}(QR) = 4x $
- $ \text{Length}(RS) = 2x + 1 $
- $ \text{Length}(QS) = 6x - 1 $

---

### Step 1: Set Up Equations Based on Equality of Side Lengths

Since the triangle is equilateral, all side lengths are equal. We can use two pairs of equalities to form equations:

#### Equation 1: $ QR = RS $
$$
4x = 2x + 1
$$
Subtracting $ 2x $ from both sides:
$$
2x = 1 \Rightarrow x = \frac{1}{2}
$$

#### Equation 2: Check Consistency with $ QS $
Now substitute $ x = \frac{1}{2} $ into the expression for $ QS $:
$$
QS = 6x - 1 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
$$
Also calculate $ QR $ and $ RS $ using $ x = \frac{1}{2} $:
- $ QR = 4x = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2 $
- $ RS = 2x + 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $

All three sides are equal, confirming the consistency of our solution.

---

### Step 2: Compute the Value of $ RS $

From above, we already determined that:
$$
RS = 2x + 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 2
$$

Thus, the length of $ RS $ is **2**.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
