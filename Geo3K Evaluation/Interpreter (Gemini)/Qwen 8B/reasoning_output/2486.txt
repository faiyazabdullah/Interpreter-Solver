====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have circle O with radius 13 inches. There's a radius OB that's perpendicular to chord CD, which is 24 inches long. Also, the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees, and we need to find the measure of arc CB. The answer choices are A. 24, B. 33, C. 67, D. 134. 

First, I remember that when a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. So since OB is perpendicular to CD, point X, where they intersect, should be the midpoint of CD. The problem also states that CX and XD are both 12 inches each because CD is 24, so that checks out. That makes sense because if you split a 24-inch chord into two equal parts, each part would be 12 inches. 

Now, since OB is a radius (length 13) and it's perpendicular to CD at its midpoint X, triangle OXC should be a right triangle. Let me visualize that. Point O is the center, so OC is another radius, also 13 inches. Wait, but OC is also a radius? Because point C lies on the circle, so yes, OC is a radius. So triangle OXC has sides OC = 13, CX = 12, and OX as the other leg. Since it's a right triangle, we can use Pythagoras here. 

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm. In triangle OXC, angle at X is 90 degrees. Therefore, OX² + CX² = OC². Plugging in numbers: OX² + 12² = 13². So OX² = 169 - 144 = 25. Thus, OX = 5 inches. So the distance from the center O to the chord CD is 5 inches. 

But how does this help us find the measure of arc CB? Hmm. Maybe we need to relate the central angles corresponding to arcs CD and CB. Let me recall that the length of a chord is related to the central angle. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle in radians. But maybe we can use the relationship between the chord length, radius, and the distance from the center to the chord. Alternatively, using trigonometry in the right triangle OXC. 

We already know that OX is 5 inches, and OC is 13 inches. So in triangle OXC, which is right-angled at X, the cosine of angle at O (which is angle COX) would be adjacent over hypotenuse. So cos(angle COX) = OX / OC = 5/13. Then angle COX is arccos(5/13). Let me calculate that. 

Calculating arccos(5/13)... Well, 5/13 is approximately 0.3846. Arccos of that is roughly... Let me think. Cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(67.38°) is about 0.3846. Wait, because cos(60°)=0.5, cos(67.38°)=approx 0.3846. Let me check with calculator steps. Let me compute arccos(5/13). 

Alternatively, since angle COX is half of the central angle for arc CX? Wait, no. Wait, angle COX is the angle between OC and OX. But OX is along the perpendicular to CD. So angle COX is actually half of the central angle for arc CX? Or perhaps not. Wait, the entire chord CD corresponds to central angle COD. Since OB is perpendicular to CD at X, then angle COD is twice angle COX? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Since OX is the perpendicular from the center to chord CD, it splits CD into two equal parts. The central angle for chord CD is angle COD. The line OX is the bisector of angle COD. Therefore, angle COX is half of angle COD. So if we can find angle COD, which corresponds to arc CD of 134 degrees. Wait, but the problem says that measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. Therefore, the central angle COD is 134 degrees. Therefore, angle COX is half of that, which is 67 degrees. Wait, but earlier we had angle COX being arccos(5/13). So maybe there's inconsistency here?

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The central angle for arc CD is 134 degrees, so angle COD is 134 degrees. Then, since OX is the perpendicular bisector, angle COX is half of angle COD. So angle COX = 134 / 2 = 67 degrees. However, earlier calculation using triangle OXC gives angle COX as arccos(5/13). Let me check if these are consistent. 

If angle COX is 67 degrees, then cos(67°) ≈ cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907. But 5/13 is approximately 0.3846. These are close but not exactly the same. That suggests that either my assumption is wrong, or there's some error in reasoning. 

Wait, why did I assume that angle COD is 134 degrees? Because the measure of arc CD is given as 134 degrees. Yes, that's correct. So angle COD is indeed 134 degrees. Therefore, angle COX is half of that, which is 67 degrees. Therefore, in triangle OXC, angle at O is 67 degrees. Then, according to the triangle, cos(angle COX) = adjacent/hypotenuse = OX / OC = 5/13. Let me check if cos(67 degrees) equals 5/13. 

Calculating 5 divided by 13: 5 ÷ 13 ≈ 0.3846. Now, cos(67°): Using calculator input, cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907. These are slightly different. So why is there a discrepancy? Is there an error in assuming that angle COD is 134 degrees? Or is there something else?

Wait, maybe the arc CD isn't directly corresponding to the central angle COD? No, arc measures correspond to central angles. So if arc CD is 134 degrees, then the central angle COD is 134 degrees. Therefore, angle COX is half of that, which is 67 degrees. However, according to triangle OXC, cos(angle COX) is 5/13 ≈ 0.3846, which would imply angle COX ≈ arccos(0.3846) ≈ 67.38 degrees. Which is very close to 67 degrees. So the slight difference might be due to rounding? Or maybe there's an exact value here. 

Let me check. Suppose angle COX is θ. Then, cosθ = 5/13. So θ = arccos(5/13). Let me compute that in degrees. Let's see:

cosθ = 5/13 → θ ≈ arccos(0.3846) ≈ 67.38 degrees. 

So if the actual measure of arc CD is 134 degrees, then angle COD is 134 degrees. But angle COD is twice angle COX, so angle COD = 2θ. Therefore, 2θ = 134 degrees ⇒ θ = 67 degrees. However, based on the triangle, θ is arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees. This seems contradictory unless there's some mistake in assumptions. 

Wait, maybe my initial assumption that angle COD is 134 degrees is incorrect? But the problem says "measure of arc CD is 134", so that should be the central angle. Unless there's something else. Wait, perhaps the arc CD is not the major arc or minor arc? The problem says "mCD = 134", so that's likely the minor arc, since 134 is less than 180. Wait, but 134 is less than 180? No, 134 is less than 180. Wait, no, 134 is less than 180? Wait 134 < 180, yes. Wait, but 134 is more than 90. So arc CD is 134 degrees, meaning that the central angle COD is 134 degrees. 

Therefore, angle COD = 134 degrees. Hence, angle COX = 134 / 2 = 67 degrees. But according to triangle OXC, angle COX is arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees. There's a small inconsistency here. 

Hmm. Perhaps the problem uses approximate values, and expects us to use the given information instead of calculating via the triangle? Wait, but the problem gives specific lengths. Let me check again. 

Given that CD is 24 inches, radius is 13. So, the distance from the center O to chord CD is OX = 5 inches, as we calculated. Then, using the formula for the length of the chord: chord length = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. Let me verify that. 

Yes, chord length = 2 * sqrt(r² - d²). Here, chord CD is 24, so:

24 = 2 * sqrt(13² - d²)

Divide both sides by 2: 12 = sqrt(169 - d²)

Square both sides: 144 = 169 - d² → d² = 169 - 144 = 25 → d = 5. Correct. So OX = 5. So that's confirmed. 

Then, in triangle OXC, which is right-angled at X, we have legs OX=5, CX=12, hypotenuse OC=13. So angle at O is angle COX. So tan(angle COX) = opposite / adjacent = CX / OX = 12/5 = 2.4. So angle COX = arctan(12/5). Let me compute that. 

arctan(12/5) is arctan(2.4). Let me calculate that in degrees. 

tan(67°) ≈ 2.355, tan(67.38°) ≈ tan(arccos(5/13))? Wait, since tan(theta) = 12/5. Let me compute arctan(12/5):

Using calculator steps:

tan(theta) = 12/5 = 2.4

theta ≈ 67.38 degrees. 

Which matches our previous calculation. So angle COX is approximately 67.38 degrees. 

But earlier, we thought that angle COD is 134 degrees, making angle COX = 67 degrees. So there's a contradiction here. Why?

Ah! Wait, maybe the measure of arc CD is not the central angle COD? But that's the definition. The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. So if arc CD is 134 degrees, then angle COD is 134 degrees. Therefore, angle COD is 134 degrees, which implies that angle COX is half of that, i.e., 67 degrees. But according to the triangle, angle COX is approx 67.38 degrees. So why the discrepancy? 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem's data? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the arc CD is not the minor arc? For example, if the arc CD is the major arc, then its measure would be 360 - 134 = 226 degrees. But the problem states "arc CD" without specifying minor or major. However, typically, when an arc is mentioned without qualification, it refers to the minor arc unless stated otherwise. But in this case, if arc CD is 134 degrees, which is the minor arc, then angle COD is 134 degrees. 

However, according to the triangle, angle COD is 2 times angle COX, which is 2*67.38 ≈ 134.76 degrees. But the problem says arc CD is 134 degrees. So there's a slight inconsistency here. 

Perhaps the problem assumes that the given arc measure is approximate, and we're supposed to use the triangle to find the angle? Or maybe there's a way to reconcile this. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc CD is referring to the major arc? Let me consider that possibility. If arc CD is the major arc, then its measure would be 360 - 134 = 226 degrees. Then, angle COD would be 226 degrees. Then angle COX would be half of that, which is 113 degrees. But that seems even worse, because angle COX is only about 67 degrees. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the arc CD is 134 degrees, and wants us to find arc CB, which might be related to the other arcs. 

Wait, maybe we don't need to rely on the central angle COD being 134 degrees? Maybe there's another approach. 

Let me think. We need to find the measure of arc CB. Points C and B are both on the circle. So arc CB is the arc from C to B. Let me think about the relationships between points. 

We have point B such that OB is a radius, and OB is perpendicular to CD. Also, since O is the center, and OB is a radius, then B is a point on the circle. Also, since OB is perpendicular to CD, which is a chord. 

So, considering the diagram, O is the center, CD is a horizontal chord (for visualization), and OB is vertical, intersecting CD at X, the midpoint. 

So, point X is the midpoint of CD, and OX is 5 units. Now, point B is somewhere on the circle such that OB is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is horizontal, OB is vertical. So depending on direction, point B could be above or below CD. But since the problem mentions arc CB, we need to determine which position of B leads to the arc measure. 

Assuming that B is on one side of CD, say above it. Then, connecting points C and B, we need to find the measure of arc CB. 

To find arc CB, we need to find the central angle COB. Once we find that angle, that will give us the measure of arc CB. 

How do we find angle COB? 

Well, we know coordinates of points? Maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me set up coordinate system. 

Let me place point O at (0,0). Since CD is a chord of length 24, and OX is 5 units from O to CD. Let me suppose that CD is horizontal. Then, since OX is the perpendicular from O to CD, which is 5 units. Let me define coordinates accordingly. 

Let’s take CD horizontal, with midpoint X at (a, b). Since OX is the perpendicular, and O is at (0,0). Let me make it simple: Let me set X at (0,5) or (0,-5)? Wait, since OX is 5 units. Let me choose coordinates so that X is along the y-axis. Let me set up coordinate system with O at origin (0,0). Let me assume that CD is horizontal, and OX is vertical. So if OX is 5 units, then point X is at (0,5) or (0,-5). Let me pick (0,5) for simplicity. Wait, but CD is a chord, and X is the midpoint. Let me think. 

If OX is 5 units, and CD is horizontal, then X is at (h,k), but since OX is perpendicular to CD, which is horizontal, then OX is vertical. Therefore, OX is along the y-axis. So let me set X at (0,5) or (0,-5). Let me choose (0,5) as X. Wait, but O is at (0,0), so OX is from (0,0) to (0,5), so that's length 5. Then CD is horizontal, passing through X=(0,5). So the coordinates of C and D are symmetric around X. Since CD is 24 units long, each half is 12 units. So since CD is horizontal, moving left and right from X=(0,5). Therefore, point C is (-12,5) and D is (12,5). Wait, but then the distance between C and D is 24, correct. 

But then, point O is at (0,0). So OC is the distance from (0,0) to (-12,5). Let me compute that distance: sqrt[(-12)^2 + (5)^2] = sqrt(144+25) = sqrt(169) = 13, which matches the radius. Perfect. Similarly for point D (12,5), same distance. 

Now, point B is such that OB is a radius and is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is horizontal, OB is vertical. Since OX is already vertical (from (0,0) to (0,5)), then OB is along the same line? Wait, OB is a radius that is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is horizontal, then OB must be vertical. Therefore, point B lies along the vertical line passing through O. But OX is already on that vertical line. So point B is either at (0,13) or (0,-13), since those are the points on the circle along the vertical line. 

Wait, but the circle has radius 13, so coordinates of B would be (0,13) or (0,-13). But since OB is perpendicular to CD, which is horizontal, then direction depends on where B is located. Let me assume that B is above the x-axis. So point B is at (0,13). 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc CB. So points C (-12,5) and B (0,13). To find the measure of arc CB, we need to find the central angle COB. 

So, angle COB is the angle between vectors OC and OB. Let me compute this angle. 

Vector OC goes from O(0,0) to C(-12,5). Vector OB goes from O(0,0) to B(0,13). 

The angle between OC and OB can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (OC · OB) / (|OC| |OB|)

Compute OC · OB: (-12)(0) + (5)(13) = 0 + 65 = 65.

|OC| = 13, |OB| = 13.

Thus, cos(theta) = 65/(13*13) = 65/169 = 5/13 ≈ 0.3846.

Therefore, theta = arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees. 

So the measure of arc CB is approximately 67.38 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 67. So that would be the answer. 

But wait, the problem states that measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. Earlier, we saw that angle COD was 134 degrees, which would correspond to the central angle between points C and D. Let me check that with our coordinates. 

Points C(-12,5) and D(12,5). The angle COD is the angle between OC and OD. Let me compute that. 

Vectors OC is (-12,5) and OD is (12,5). The angle between them can be computed as:

cos(theta) = (OC · OD)/(|OC||OD|) = [(-12)(12) + 5*5]/(13*13) = [-144 + 25]/169 = (-119)/169 ≈ -0.7041. 

So theta = arccos(-119/169) ≈ arccos(-0.7041). Let me calculate that. 

cos(theta) ≈ -0.7041. So theta is in second quadrant. Let me compute the reference angle. arccos(0.7041) ≈ 45.2 degrees. Therefore, the actual angle is 180 - 45.2 = 134.8 degrees. Which is approximately 134.8 degrees. Close to the given 134 degrees. Considering possible rounding, this aligns with the problem's statement. 

Therefore, the measure of arc CD is approximately 134.8 degrees, which rounds to 134 degrees as given. Therefore, the measure of arc CB is arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees, which is closest to option C (67). 

Hence, the answer should be C. 67 degrees. 

Another way to look at it: since arc CB corresponds to the central angle of approximately 67.38 degrees, which is closest to 67, so answer C. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate it exactly using the given arc CD measure. 

Wait, since arc CD is 134 degrees, which is the measure we used to get the approximate angle. But in reality, the exact measure is arccos(-119/169). However, the problem says arc CD is 134 degrees, so we are to use that. Therefore, perhaps there's a relation between arcs CB and CD? 

Alternatively, since angle COD is 134 degrees, and angle COB is theta (which we found as approx 67.38 degrees), then maybe there's a relationship between these angles. But I think the coordinate method shows that arc CB is approx 67.38 degrees, so answer C. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 67. So the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $, we begin by analyzing the key geometric setup:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Information**

- Circle $ O $ has a radius of 13 inches.
- Chord $ CD $ is 24 inches long, and it lies on the circle.
- Line segment $ OB $ is a radius and is **perpendicular** to chord $ CD $.
- Point $ X $ is the intersection of $ OB $ and $ CD $, and it is the **midpoint** of chord $ CD $. Therefore, $ CX = XD = 12 $ inches.
- Arc $ \widehat{CD} $ measures 134 degrees.
  
From this, we conclude that the central angle subtended by chord $ CD $ is $ \angle COD = 134^\circ $, since the measure of an arc equals the measure of its central angle.

---

### **Step 2: Use Right Triangle Geometry**

Since $ OB \perp CD $ at point $ X $, and $ X $ is the midpoint of $ CD $, triangle $ \triangle OXC $ is a right triangle:

- $ OC = 13 $ (radius),
- $ CX = 12 $,
- $ OX = \sqrt{OC^2 - CX^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - 12^2} = \sqrt{169 - 144} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $

Thus, in triangle $ \triangle OXC $, we apply the Law of Cosines to find $ \angle COX $:

$$
\cos(\angle COX) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{OX}{OC} = \frac{5}{13}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\angle COX = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{5}{13} \right) \approx 67.38^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine Central Angle for Arc $ \widehat{CB} $**

Recall that in a circle, the central angle formed by two radii connecting endpoints of an arc equals the measure of the arc itself.

Here, we want to find the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $. This corresponds to the central angle $ \angle COB $, where $ B $ is the endpoint of the radius $ OB $, and $ O $ is the center.

Because $ OB \perp CD $, and $ CD $ lies horizontally, while $ OB $ is vertical, point $ B $ lies directly above or below point $ O $ on the circle. Assuming the standard orientation, we place $ B $ vertically above the center $ O $, at point $ (0, 13) $ in a coordinate system centered at the origin.

Now, vector $ \vec{OC} = (-12, 5) $ and vector $ \vec{OB} = (0, 13) $. The angle between these vectors (i.e., $ \angle COB $) is determined using the dot product:

$$
\cos(\angle COB) = \frac{\vec{OC} \cdot \vec{OB}}{|\vec{OC}| |\vec{OB}|} = \frac{-12 \cdot 0 + 5 \cdot 13}{13 \cdot 13} = \frac{65}{169} = \frac{5}{13}
$$

So:

$$
\angle COB = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{5}{13} \right) \approx 67.38^\circ
$$

Thus, the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $ is also approximately **67.38 degrees**.

---

### **Step 4: Match with Given Options**

Among the answer choices:

- A. 24
- B. 33
- C. 67
- D. 134

The closest value to $ \approx 67.38^\circ $ is **67**, which matches **option C**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{C}
