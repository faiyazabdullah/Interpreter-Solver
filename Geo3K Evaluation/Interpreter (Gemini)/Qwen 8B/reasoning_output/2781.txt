MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a rhombus ABCD, and we know that angle ABC is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1, which is defined as angle BAC. Wait, let me check the problem again.

The question says: "what is m∠1?" And it mentions that Angle(1) equals Angle(B,A,C). So angle 1 is angle BAC. Got it.

First, let me recall the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal, opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no—actually, they bisect each other and bisect the angles. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So each diagonal splits the angles into two equal parts.

Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees. Since ABCD is a rhombus, then angle ABC is one of the angles. Let me draw this mentally. Let me label the rhombus ABCD in order. So AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. The vertices are connected in order.

In a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ABC + angle BCD = 180 degrees. But since it's a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So angle ABC equals angle ADC, and angle BAD equals angle BCD.

Wait, so if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle ADC is also 70 degrees. Then angles BAD and BCD would be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees each. Because consecutive angles are supplementary.

But we need to find angle BAC. Let me think about triangle ABC here. Wait, point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. Also, each diagonal bisects the angles.

So, for example, diagonal AC bisects angles at A and C. Similarly, diagonal BD bisects angles at B and D.

Wait, the problem states that line AC (which is a diagonal) bisects angle BCD and angle BAD. Similarly, line BD bisects angles at ABC and ADC.

So, given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, and BD bisects angle ABC. Therefore, angle ABD equals angle CBD, each being half of 70, so 35 degrees.

But how does this help us with angle BAC? Let me consider triangle ABC. Wait, triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB equals BC. So triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = BC. Wait, AB equals BC because all sides of a rhombus are equal. Wait, AB is a side, BC is another side. So yes, AB = BC. So triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC, and base AC. Wait, but angle at B is 70 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angles at A and C should be equal?

Wait, hold on. Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If AB = BC, then the base angles are at A and C. Wait, but angle at B is 70 degrees. So angles at A and C would be (180 - 70)/2 = 55 degrees each. Wait, but angle at A in triangle ABC is angle BAC, which is angle 1. So angle BAC is 55 degrees? That would make angle 1 equal to 55 degrees, which is option B.

Wait, but let me confirm. Because in the rhombus, angle ABC is 70 degrees. So in triangle ABC, AB = BC, making it an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angles opposite equal sides are equal. Wait, AB equals BC. So the sides AB and BC are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite them would be angles at C and A respectively. Wait, in triangle ABC, side AB is opposite angle C, and side BC is opposite angle A. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me clarify. In triangle ABC:

- Side AB is between points A and B.

- Side BC is between points B and C.

Since AB = BC (because all sides of the rhombus are equal), then triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal. The angle opposite AB is angle C (at point C), and the angle opposite BC is angle A (at point A). Wait, but in triangle ABC, angle at A is angle BAC, and angle at C is angle BCA.

Therefore, angles at A and C in triangle ABC are equal. Therefore, angle BAC = angle BCA.

So angle at B is 70 degrees, so angles at A and C are (180 - 70)/2 = 55 degrees each. Hence, angle BAC is 55 degrees, which is angle 1. So the answer would be B. 55.

But let me check again using the properties of rhombus and diagonals.

Alternatively, considering the diagonals. Diagonals in a rhombus bisect the angles. So diagonal AC bisects angle at A and angle at C. Wait, angle at A is angle DAB. Wait, angle BAC is part of angle DAB.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, they bisect each other and bisect the angles. But do they intersect at 90 degrees? Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, if we consider diagonal AC and BD intersecting at point E. Then AE is half of AC, BE is half of BD. Also, since diagonals bisect the angles. For instance, diagonal AC bisects angle BAD and angle BCD. Similarly, BD bisects angles ABC and ADC.

So, given angle ABC is 70 degrees. Since BD bisects angle ABC, then angle ABD and angle CBD are each 35 degrees. Now, looking at triangle ABD. Wait, but maybe triangle ABE?

Wait, let me focus on triangle ABC. Earlier reasoning suggested that angle BAC is 55 degrees. But let me check with coordinates or vectors.

Alternatively, since angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle BAD is 110 degrees (since consecutive angles are supplementary). Then, since diagonal AC bisects angle BAD, so angle BAC is half of angle BAD. Wait, that's another way to see it.

Because angle BAD is 110 degrees. Diagonal AC splits angle BAD into two equal angles. Therefore, angle BAC = 110 / 2 = 55 degrees. Which matches the previous conclusion. So angle 1 is 55 degrees. Hence, answer B.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But why did the problem include all those constraints? Maybe to ensure that we recognize the properties of the rhombus. So the key steps are:

1. Recognize that ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal.

2. Consecutive angles are supplementary. Given angle ABC = 70°, so angle BAD = 180 - 70 = 110°.

3. Diagonal AC bisects angle BAD, so angle BAC is half of angle BAD, which is 110°/2 = 55°.

Thus, angle 1 is 55°, which corresponds to option B.

Another way: Using triangle ABC. Since AB=BC, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB=BC. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. Sum of angles is 180°, so 70 + 2x = 180 → x = 55°. Therefore, angle BAC is 55°, which is angle 1.

Either method gives 55°, so answer B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 1 $, which is defined as $ \angle BAC $, we begin by analyzing the geometric properties of the rhombus $ ABCD $, based on the given information and constraints.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Rhombus**

- All sides of a rhombus are equal:  
  $$
  AB = BC = CD = DA
  $$

- Opposite angles are equal:  
  $$
  \angle ABC = \angle ADC,\quad \angle BAD = \angle BCD
  $$

- Adjacent angles are supplementary:  
  $$
  \angle ABC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ
  $$

- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and also bisect the vertex angles.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Given Information**

We're told that:
$$
\angle ABC = 70^\circ
$$

From the property of a rhombus:
$$
\angle BCD = \angle ABC = 70^\circ
$$
and
$$
\angle BAD = \angle BCD = 110^\circ
$$
(since adjacent angles are supplementary).

Also, since diagonal $ AC $ bisects angle $ BAD $, we can split it:
$$
\angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2} \times 110^\circ = 55^\circ
$$

This directly identifies:
$$
\angle 1 = \angle BAC = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Verification via Triangle Analysis**

Consider triangle $ ABC $. Since all sides of the rhombus are equal:
$$
AB = BC \Rightarrow \triangle ABC \text{ is isosceles}
$$

Hence,
$$
\angle BAC = \angle BCA
$$

Using the triangle angle sum:
$$
\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
\Rightarrow 70^\circ + 2\angle BAC = 180^\circ
\Rightarrow 2\angle BAC = 110^\circ
\Rightarrow \angle BAC = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Both methods lead to the same conclusion:  
$$
\angle 1 = \angle BAC = 55^\circ
$$

---

**Final Answer: B**
