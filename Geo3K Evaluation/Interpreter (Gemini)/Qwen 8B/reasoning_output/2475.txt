====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x given these two angles, angle 4 and angle 5. The problem says that line l is parallel to line m, so maybe there's something about parallel lines here. Let me recall... when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Wait, but the question mentions angle 4 and angle 5. Are they related through some of those properties?

The measures are given as m∠4 = 2x + 23 and m∠5 = 7x - 5. Also, it says that the sum of measure of angle 4 and measure of angle 5 equals 180 degrees. So maybe they're supplementary? That would make sense if they are consecutive interior angles or same-side interior angles formed by the transversal. Since lines l and m are parallel, those angles would add up to 180 degrees. 

So according to the problem, adding angle 4 and angle 5 gives 180 degrees. Therefore:

m∠4 + m∠5 = 180°

Substituting the expressions:

(2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180

Combine like terms:

2x + 7x is 9x. Then constants: 23 - 5 is 18. So:

9x + 18 = 180

Then subtract 18 from both sides:

9x = 180 - 18 = 162

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 162 / 9 = 18.

Wait, so x is 18? Let me check the answer choices. Option B is 18. But wait, let me confirm if my assumption is correct. Are angles 4 and 5 supplementary?

Since lines l and m are parallel, if angles 4 and 5 are on the same side of the transversal, then yes, they should be supplementary. For example, if angle 4 is on line l and angle 5 is on line m, then they would form consecutive interior angles. Alternatively, maybe they are vertical angles? No, vertical angles are equal, not supplementary. Or maybe they are corresponding angles? Then they would be equal. But the equations given here have different coefficients for x. So that suggests they aren't equal. Hence, they must be supplementary. Therefore, their sum is 180. 

Let me verify again. If x=18, then angle 4 would be 2*18 +23 = 36+23=59 degrees. Angle 5 would be 7*18 -5=126-5=121 degrees. Adding them together: 59+121=180. Yes, that works. So x=18. Which is option B. But wait, looking at the answer choices, option B is 18. However, sometimes problems might have tricks. Let me check again the original problem statement.

The problem says "If m∠5 = 7x - 5 and m∠4 = 2x + 23, find x." And the constraints include that lines l and m are parallel. So the key was assuming that angles 4 and 5 are supplementary because they are same-side interior angles. So the equations set up correctly. So solving gives x=18. So answer B. 

But wait, the answer choices have option B as 18. So that seems correct. Let me check if there's another way. Maybe angles 4 and 5 are not supplementary? Suppose they are corresponding angles, then they would be equal. So setting 2x +23 =7x -5. Solving that would give 23 +5 =7x -2x => 28=5x => x=5.6 which is option A. But why would that be? But since the problem states that the sum of angles 4 and 5 is 180, that suggests that they are supplementary, not equal. Therefore, the first approach is correct. So answer is B. 

Therefore, Final Answer: B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given information and applying geometric principles.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Context**

We are told:
- Lines $ l $ and $ m $ are **parallel**.
- Angles $ \angle 4 $ and $ \angle 5 $ are formed by a transversal intersecting these parallel lines.
- The measure of each angle is expressed algebraically:
  - $ m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 $
  - $ m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 $

Additionally, it is stated that:
$$
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
$$

This implies that **angles 4 and 5 are supplementary**, which occurs when they are **consecutive interior angles** (or same-side interior angles) formed by a transversal cutting through two parallel lines. This relationship directly leads us to the equation above.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

Using the expression for the measures of the angles:
$$
(2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
$$

Now simplify the left-hand side:
$$
2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180 \\
9x + 18 = 180
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Subtract 18 from both sides:
$$
9x = 162
$$

Divide both sides by 9:
$$
x = \frac{162}{9} = 18
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**

Plug $ x = 18 $ back into the expressions for the angles:
- $ m\angle 4 = 2(18) + 23 = 36 + 23 = 59^\circ $
- $ m\angle 5 = 7(18) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121^\circ $

Check the sum:
$$
59 + 121 = 180^\circ
$$

This confirms our solution is consistent with the given conditions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ x $ that satisfies the geometric constraints is:

$$
\boxed{18}
$$
