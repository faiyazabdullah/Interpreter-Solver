C. 12 \sqrt { 3 }
D. 36

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of WY in a regular hexagon where each side is 12 cm. Hmm. First, let me recall some properties of regular hexagons. 

A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular hexagon is 120 degrees. Also, it can be divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. So, maybe that's useful here.

Now, the question is about the distance between points W and Y. Let me visualize the hexagon. The vertices are labeled U, V, W, X, Y, Z in order. So, starting at U, then V, W, X, Y, Z, and back to U. 

Let me try to sketch this mentally. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, and the distance between opposite sides is twice the apothem. But wait, maybe I need coordinates? Coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to each point to calculate the distance between W and Y.

Assuming the hexagon is centered at the origin for simplicity. Let me consider placing point U at (a, 0). Since it's regular, each subsequent vertex will be separated by 60-degree rotations. Wait, but maybe using complex numbers could make this easier?

Alternatively, since all sides are length 12, the radius of the circumscribed circle (distance from center to any vertex) is equal to the side length. Because in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So, if each side is 12 cm, then the distance from the center to any vertex is also 12 cm.

So, coordinates of the vertices can be determined using trigonometric functions. Let me think. If we have a regular hexagon with center at the origin, then each vertex can be represented as:

For vertex k (from 0 to 5), the coordinates would be (r * cos(theta), r * sin(theta)), where theta = 60° * k. Here, r is the radius, which equals the side length. Wait, but actually, in a regular hexagon, the side length 's' is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So yes, r = s = 12.

But let me confirm that. For example, in a regular hexagon, the distance between two adjacent vertices is equal to the radius. Yes, because when you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle has sides equal to the radius. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius. So, each vertex is 12 units away from the center.

Therefore, coordinates:

Let me label the vertices in order. Let me assume the first vertex U is at angle 0°, so its coordinates are (12, 0). Then moving counterclockwise, each next vertex is 60° more. So:

- Vertex U: angle 0° → (12, 0)
- Vertex V: 60° → (12cos60°, 12sin60°)
- Vertex W: 120° → (12cos120°, 12sin120°)
- Vertex X: 180° → (-12, 0)
- Vertex Y: 240° → (12cos240°, 12sin240°)
- Vertex Z: 300° → (12cos300°, 12sin300°)

Wait, but let me check the order. The hexagon is U-V-W-X-Y-Z-U. So starting from U at 0°, moving counterclockwise, each vertex increases by 60°. So yes, the angles for each vertex are multiples of 60°, starting from 0° for U.

So, coordinates:

U: (12, 0)
V: (12*cos(60°), 12*sin(60°)) → cos60°=0.5, sin60°=(√3)/2. So V is (6, 6√3)
W: 120°, cos120° = cos(180°−60°)= -cos60° = -0.5; sin120° = sin(60°) = √3/2. So W is (12*(-0.5), 12*(√3/2)) → (-6, 6√3)
X: 180°, cos180°=-1, sin180°=0 → (-12, 0)
Y: 240°, cos240° = cos(180°+60°)= -cos60° = -0.5; sin240°= sin(180°+60°)= -sin60°= -√3/2. So Y is (12*(-0.5), 12*(-√3/2)) → (-6, -6√3)
Z: 300°, cos300°=cos(-60°)=0.5, sin300°=sin(-60°)= -√3/2. So Z is (12*0.5, 12*(-√3/2)) → (6, -6√3)

So coordinates:

U: (12, 0)
V: (6, 6√3)
W: (-6, 6√3)
X: (-12, 0)
Y: (-6, -6√3)
Z: (6, -6√3)

Now, need to find the distance between W and Y.

Coordinates of W: (-6, 6√3)
Coordinates of Y: (-6, -6√3)

So the distance between W and Y is sqrt[ (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ]

Calculating differences:

x-coordinate difference: (-6) - (-6) = 0
y-coordinate difference: (-6√3) - (6√3) = -12√3

Therefore, distance WY is sqrt[0^2 + (-12√3)^2] = sqrt[ (144 * 3) ] = sqrt[432]

Simplify sqrt(432):

Break down 432: 144 * 3 = 432. So sqrt(144*3) = 12√3.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the distance between W and Y is 12√3. Which matches option C.

But let me double-check my steps. Did I compute coordinates correctly?

Yes, for W at 120°, which is second quadrant, x negative, y positive. Y at 240°, third quadrant, x negative, y negative. Their x-coordinates are both -6. So vertical line. Difference in y is from 6√3 to -6√3, total difference of 12√3. Hence, distance is 12√3. So answer should be C.

But wait, another way to think: in a regular hexagon, the distance between two vertices depends on how many edges apart they are. Let me think about the positions.

In a regular hexagon, each vertex is separated by 60 degrees. The distance between two vertices can be determined based on their separation.

Adjacent vertices: distance is 12.

Two apart (like U to W): that's two edges apart. Let me think. For example, U to W: skipping one vertex (V). What's the distance between U and W?

Using coordinates, U is (12, 0), W is (-6, 6√3). Distance squared is (12 - (-6))^2 + (0 - 6√3)^2 = (18)^2 + ( -6√3)^2 = 324 + 36*3 = 324 + 108 = 432. Square root is sqrt(432) = 12√3. Same as before. So same result. So if W and Y are two edges apart? Let me check their positions.

From W to X to Y: W is connected to X, X to Y. So W and Y are two edges apart? Or three?

Wait, the vertices are U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So W is connected to X and V. Then Y comes after X. So from W to X to Y. So W to Y skips one vertex (X). So they are two edges apart? Or in terms of steps around the hexagon, the number of edges between them.

Alternatively, considering the positions: W is at position 3 (if counting from 0: U=0, V=1, W=2, X=3, Y=4, Z=5). Wait, no. Let me index them properly.

If we start at U as index 0, then:

Index 0: U

Index 1: V

Index 2: W

Index 3: X

Index 4: Y

Index 5: Z

Then, the distance between index 2 (W) and index 4 (Y) is two indices apart. In a hexagon, the maximum distance between two vertices is across the hexagon, which is three edges apart (diametrically opposite).

But in terms of chord lengths, the distance between vertices separated by k steps is 2*R*sin(kπ/6). Since R is the radius, which equals the side length here.

Wait, formula for chord length between two vertices separated by m edges: chord length = 2R*sin(π*m/n), where n is the number of sides. For a hexagon, n=6. So chord length between two vertices separated by m edges is 2R*sin(mπ/6).

In our case, R = 12 cm.

So for W and Y: How many edges apart are they?

From W (index 2) to Y (index 4): that's two edges apart along the perimeter. Alternatively, going the other way, from W to Z to Y is two edges as well? Wait, no. From W to Z is one edge (W to Z?), no. Wait, the connections are W to X, X to Y, etc. So from W to Y, going clockwise: W -> X -> Y, so two edges. Going counter-clockwise: W -> V -> U -> Z -> Y? That's longer. So the minimal number of edges between W and Y is two. Therefore, m=2.

Thus, chord length is 2*12*sin(2π/6) = 24*sin(π/3) = 24*(√3/2) = 12√3. Which matches our previous calculation. So the answer is 12√3, which is option C.

Another way: in a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be categorized. There are different types of diagonals: short diagonals (connecting vertices with one vertex in between), long diagonals (connecting opposite vertices). 

The length of the short diagonal (two edges apart) is 2*s*sin(60°) = 2*12*(√3/2) = 12√3. Which again gives the same answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 12√3.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of segment $ WY $ in a **regular hexagon** with side length $ 12 $ cm, we begin by leveraging key geometric properties of regular polygons, particularly those of a **regular hexagon**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of a Regular Hexagon

A regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle such that all its **vertices lie on the circumference** of the circle. This means:

- All sides are equal in length.
- All interior angles measure $ 120^\circ $.
- The **radius of the circumscribed circle** is equal to the **side length** of the hexagon.

This allows us to place the hexagon in a coordinate system with the **center at the origin**, and each vertex corresponding to an angle multiple of $ 60^\circ $.

---

### Step 2: Assign Coordinates Based on Angles

Labeling the vertices as $ U, V, W, X, Y, Z $ in counterclockwise order, we can assign coordinates using polar form:

$$
\text{Vertex } P_k = (12 \cdot \cos(\theta_k), 12 \cdot \sin(\theta_k)), \quad \text{where } \theta_k = \frac{k \pi}{3} \text{ radians}
$$

Using this:

- $ U = (12, 0) $
- $ V = (6, 6\sqrt{3}) $
- $ W = (-6, 6\sqrt{3}) $
- $ X = (-12, 0) $
- $ Y = (-6, -6\sqrt{3}) $
- $ Z = (6, -6\sqrt{3}) $

We are interested in finding the distance between $ W $ and $ Y $, i.e., between $ (-6, 6\sqrt{3}) $ and $ (-6, -6\sqrt{3}) $.

---

### Step 3: Use the Distance Formula

Apply the Euclidean distance formula:

$$
WY = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

Substitute the coordinates of $ W $ and $ Y $:

$$
WY = \sqrt{(-6 - (-6))^2 + (-6\sqrt{3} - 6\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{0 + (-12\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{144 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{432}
$$

Simplify:

$$
\sqrt{432} = \sqrt{144 \cdot 3} = 12\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### Final Verification via Chord Length Formula

An alternative method uses the **chord length formula** in a regular polygon:

$$
\text{Chord length} = 2R \cdot \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right)
$$

Where:
- $ R = 12 $ (since side length = radius),
- $ m $ is the number of edges between the vertices,
- $ n = 6 $ for a hexagon.

Vertices $ W $ and $ Y $ are **two edges apart**, so $ m = 2 $. Thus:

$$
WY = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{6}\right) = 24 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 24 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 12\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### Conclusion

Both methods yield the same result. Therefore, the length of segment $ WY $ is:

$$
\boxed{12\sqrt{3}}
$$

---

### Final Answer:  
$$
\text{Final Answer: C}
$$
