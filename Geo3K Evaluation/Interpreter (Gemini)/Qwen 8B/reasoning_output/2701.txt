MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle XYZ in this parallelogram WXYZ. First, I need to recall the properties of a parallelogram. From what I remember, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel, and opposite angles are congruent. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. 

The problem gives several constraints. Let me list them out again:

- It's a parallelogram WXYZ, so sides WX and YZ are parallel and congruent, as are sides XY and WZ. 
- The lengths of XY and ZY are given as 24 and 28 respectively? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again. The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)), 24) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), 28). So line XY has length 24, and line ZY (which is the same as YZ?) Wait, line ZY would be the same as YZ but in reverse direction. But since we're talking about length, it's the same. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are congruent. So if XY is 24, then the opposite side WZ should also be 24. Similarly, if YZ is 28, then the opposite side WX should be 28. Wait, but the problem also states that Congruent(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)). So that means WX equals YZ. So if YZ is 28, then WX is 28. And XY is 24, so WZ is 24. That makes sense.

Then there are some angles mentioned. The measure of angle ZWX is 105 degrees. So angle at point W between points Z and X. Then there's a statement that angle ZWX is congruent to angle XYZ? Wait, the problem says Congruent(Angle(Z,W,X), Angle(X,Y,Z)). So angle ZWX (which is angle at W) is congruent to angle XYZ (which is angle at Y). Wait, angle XYZ would be the angle at point Y between points X and Z. Hmm. 

Also, there's another condition that the sum of measure of angle ZWX (which is 105°) and measure of angle WXY (the angle at X) is 180°. Because consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. So angle at W plus angle at X equals 180. Since angle at W is 105°, angle at X would be 75°, right? Because 105 + 75 = 180. 

But wait, the question asks for m∠XYZ. Which is angle at Y. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent. So angle at Y is congruent to angle at W? Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent. So angle W and angle Y are opposite? Let me visualize the parallelogram. Let me think of the vertices in order: W, X, Y, Z. So the angles at each vertex: angle W, angle X, angle Y, angle Z. Opposite angles are angle W and angle Y, angle X and angle Z. Therefore, if angle W is 105°, then angle Y is also 105°. But wait, but the problem says that angle ZWX is 105°, which is angle W. Then according to the conditions, angle ZWX is congruent to angle XYZ. Wait, angle XYZ is angle at Y, which is angle Y. So if angle W is 105°, then angle Y is also 105°, making that the measure of angle XYZ. But then why does the problem mention other things?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through the problem again step by step. 

First, the problem gives that angle Z,W,X is 105°, which is angle at W. Then, the problem states that angle ZWX is congruent to angle XYZ. Wait, angle XYZ is the angle at Y. So if angle at W is 105°, then angle at Y is also 105°, so m∠XYZ is 105°, which would make answer C. But let me confirm with the other information.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Let me clarify the notation for angles. 

In angle Z,W,X, the middle letter is the vertex. So angle Z-W-X is the angle at point W between points Z and X. So that's angle W. Similarly, angle X,Y,Z is the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So that's angle Y. Therefore, the problem says these two angles are congruent. So angle W ≅ angle Y. 

Given that angle W is 105°, then angle Y is also 105°, hence m∠XYZ is 105°, which would be option C. However, I need to check if there are other constraints that might affect this.

Another thing: the sum of angle ZWX (angle W) and angle WXY (angle X) equals 180°, as per the given constraint. Since angle W is 105°, angle X must be 75°, because 105 + 75 = 180. Then, since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, angle X and angle Y are supplementary? Wait, no. Consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle X and angle Y are adjacent, so their sum is 180. Wait, angle X is 75°, so angle Y would be 105°, which matches our previous conclusion. Hence, angle Y is 105°, which is the measure of angle XYZ. So that would mean the answer is C. 

But wait, the problem also mentions that angle WXY is congruent to angle ZYX? Wait, no. Let me check the given congruencies. The problem says Congruent(Angle(W,X,Y), Angle(Y,Z,W)). So angle W,X,Y is angle at X, and angle Y,Z,W is angle at Z. So angle X ≅ angle Z. Since angle X is 75°, then angle Z is also 75°. 

So, angles in the parallelogram are: angle W = 105°, angle X = 75°, angle Y = 105°, angle Z = 75°, which adds up to 360°, which checks out. 

Therefore, m∠XYZ is angle at Y, which is 105°, so answer C. 

Wait, but the answer choices include C as 105. So then why is there confusion? Maybe there's something else. Let me recheck the problem. 

Wait, the problem says that angle Z,W,X is 105°, which is angle W. Then, the problem says that angle Z,W,X is congruent to angle X,Y,Z. Wait, angle X,Y,Z is angle at Y. So angle W ≅ angle Y. Therefore, angle Y is 105°, so answer C. 

Yes, that seems straightforward. Unless there's some misunderstanding in the notation. Alternatively, could there be a miscalculation? For example, if angle XYZ was supposed to be angle at Y, but in the parallelogram, maybe it's different. Let me draw a rough sketch mentally. 

Imagine parallelogram WXYZ, with points labeled in order. So sides WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So angle at X is between W and Y, so angle WXY. Angle at Y is between X and Z, so angle XYZ. So yes, angle XYZ is at Y. So if angle at Y is congruent to angle at W, which is 105°, then answer is C. 

But wait, the problem says that the sum of angle Z,W,X (angle W) and angle W,X,Y (angle X) is 180°, which gives angle X as 75°, as before. Therefore, angle Y is 105°, so answer is C. 

But looking back at the answer choices, option C is 105. So that would be the answer. However, sometimes problems can have tricks. Let me check once more. 

Wait, another way: in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle W + angle X = 180°, angle X + angle Y = 180°, etc. Given angle W is 105°, then angle X is 75°, angle Y is 105°, angle Z is 75°, which fits. So angle XYZ is angle Y, which is 105°, so answer C. 

Thus, the correct answer is C.
