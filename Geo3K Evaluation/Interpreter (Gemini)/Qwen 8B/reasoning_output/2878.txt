MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question says that angles 1 and 2 form a linear pair, and the measure of angle 2 is 67 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1. The answer choices are A through D.

First, I remember that a linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. That means they are supplementary, right? Because when two angles form a linear pair, their measures add up to 180 degrees. Wait, so if they're supplementary, then angle 1 plus angle 2 equals 180 degrees. 

Given that angle 2 is 67 degrees, we can set up an equation: angle1 + 67 = 180. To find angle1, subtract 67 from both sides. Let me do that calculation. 180 minus 67... Hmm, 180 minus 60 is 120, and then minus 7 more would be 113. So angle1 should be 113 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 113. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something else in the problem that I missed? The problem mentions points A, B, C, D, lines AD and BC intersecting at point C. Also, there's some mention of angles 1 and 2. But the key part here is that they form a linear pair. So regardless of the diagram, the fact that they are a linear pair tells us they are supplementary. 

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here? Like, could angle 1 and angle 2 not be adjacent? But the problem states they form a linear pair, which by definition requires them to be adjacent and supplementary. So I think my initial thought is correct. Therefore, angle1 is 180 - 67 = 113 degrees. So the answer should be B. Let me check again: 67 + 113 is 180. Yep, that adds up. So the correct answer is B.
