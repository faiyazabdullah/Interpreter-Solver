MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. Let me recall what a central angle is. In the context of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, a central angle is the angle formed at the center of the circle by two adjacent vertices of the polygon.

First, I remember that in a regular polygon with n sides, each central angle can be calculated using the formula: 360 degrees divided by n. Since it's a hexagon, which has 6 sides, substituting n=6 into the formula gives 360/6 = 60 degrees. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Wait, the problem mentions a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle. All the vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. Each side of the hexagon corresponds to an arc on the circle. The central angle would then correspond to the angle between two radii connecting the center of the circle to two consecutive vertices of the hexagon. 

So, since there are six equal arcs (because it's regular), each arc measures 360/6 = 60 degrees. Therefore, the central angle should be 60 degrees. That seems straightforward. But let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe they're referring to an internal angle of the hexagon? No, because the question specifically mentions a central angle. 

Another thought: sometimes people confuse central angles with the internal angles of the polygon. But for a regular hexagon, the internal angle is different. The formula for the internal angle of a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n. Plugging in n=6, that would be (4*180)/6 = 120 degrees. However, that's the internal angle at each vertex of the hexagon, not the central angle. 

The problem states that the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, so the key here is that the central angles are determined by the number of sides. Since a hexagon has six sides, each central angle is 360/6 = 60 degrees. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 60. That seems right. Let me confirm once more. If you draw a regular hexagon inside a circle, each radius connects the center to a vertex. The angle between two adjacent radii is indeed 60 degrees. So yes, the measure of the central angle is 60 degrees. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
