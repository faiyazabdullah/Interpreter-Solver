====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the perimeter of triangle RUW, which is similar to triangle STV. The given information includes some lengths for triangle STV: ST is 24, VS is 12, and VT is 18. Also, they mention that UW is 21. Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides should be in proportion.

First, let me recall that similar triangles have corresponding sides in proportion. So, the ratio of similarity between triangle RUW and STV would be the same for all corresponding sides. Let me figure out which sides correspond. 

The problem states that triangle RUW ~ triangle STV. But wait, how do I know which vertices correspond? Typically, the order matters. If it's Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V), then vertex R corresponds to S, U corresponds to T, and W corresponds to V. Wait, but the notation might vary. Let me check again. The original statement says Similar(Triangle(R,U,W), Triangle(S,T,V)). So the correspondence is R→S, U→T, W→V. Therefore, side RU corresponds to ST, UW corresponds to TV, and RW corresponds to SV. Wait, no—let me think about the sides. In triangle STV, the sides are ST, TV, and VS. Wait, maybe I should list the sides properly.

Let me write down the sides of both triangles:

For triangle STV:
- Side opposite S: TV (since S is connected to T and V)
Wait, actually, each side is between two vertices. Let me clarify:

In triangle STV, the sides are:
- ST: between S and T
- TV: between T and V
- VS: between V and S

Similarly, in triangle RUW, the sides are:
- RU: between R and U
- UW: between U and W
- WR: between W and R

Since the triangles are similar, the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So, Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V) implies that:

R corresponds to S,

U corresponds to T,

W corresponds to V.

Therefore, the sides:

RU corresponds to ST,

UW corresponds to TV,

RW corresponds to VS.

So the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Given that, we can set up proportions.

We know the length of ST is 24, which corresponds to RU. Then, the ratio of similarity (k) would be RU / ST = k. Similarly, UW corresponds to TV. Wait, but what's the length of TV?

Wait, in triangle STV, the sides are ST=24, VS=12, VT=18. Wait, so ST is 24, VS is 12, and VT is 18. Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(S,T)), 24)

So ST is 24.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(V,S)), 12): VS is 12.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(V,T)), 18): VT is 18.

So triangle STV has sides ST=24, VS=12, VT=18. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of two sides must be greater than the third. Let me check: 12 + 18 = 30 > 24; 12+24=36>18; 18+24=42>12. Okay, valid triangle.

Now, since triangles RUW and STV are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. We also know that in triangle RUW, the side UW is given as 21. Which side does UW correspond to in triangle STV?

Earlier, we said that UW corresponds to TV. Because in triangle STV, TV is the side opposite to S. Wait, perhaps I need to check the correspondence again.

If the correspondence is R→S, U→T, W→V, then:

Side RU (between R and U) corresponds to side ST (between S and T).

Side UW (between U and W) corresponds to side TV (between T and V).

Side RW (between R and W) corresponds to side VS (between V and S).

Yes, because in triangle STV, side TV connects T and V, which correspond to U and W in triangle RUW. So TV corresponds to UW. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is (length of UW)/(length of TV). Wait, but we need to confirm which sides correspond.

Alternatively, let me think of the ratio based on the given knowns. For example, we know that UW is 21. What is the corresponding side in triangle STV? Since UW corresponds to TV. From earlier, TV is 18. So the ratio of similarity would be UW / TV = 21 / 18 = 7/6. Alternatively, maybe I should use another pair of sides to check.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the ratio using another pair. For instance, if VS corresponds to RW. VS is 12, and RW is unknown. Or maybe ST corresponds to RU. ST is 24, and RU is unknown. Wait, but the problem gives us that UW is 21. So if UW corresponds to TV, which is 18, then the ratio is 21/18 = 7/6. That seems like a key point.

But let me verify that the correspondence is correct. Suppose that triangle RUW ~ triangle STV with the correspondence R→S, U→T, W→V. Then, the sides:

RU corresponds to ST,

UW corresponds to TV,

RW corresponds to VS.

Thus, the ratios would be:

RU / ST = UW / TV = RW / VS.

Given that, since we know UW is 21 and TV is 18, so 21 / 18 = 7/6. Thus, the scale factor from triangle STV to triangle RUW is 7/6. Therefore, each side of RUW is 7/6 times the corresponding side of STV.

Wait, but let me check whether that holds. For example, if RU corresponds to ST, then RU = ST * (scale factor). So if the ratio is 7/6, then RU would be 24*(7/6)=28. But we don't know RU yet. However, we do know that UW is 21, which corresponds to TV (which is 18). So that ratio is 21/18 = 7/6. So yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, the scale factor is 7/6. Therefore, all sides of triangle RUW are 7/6 times the corresponding sides of triangle STV.

So, to find the perimeter of triangle RUW, we can take the perimeter of triangle STV multiplied by the scale factor.

But first, let me calculate the perimeter of triangle STV. Its sides are ST=24, VS=12, VT=18. Adding them together: 24 + 12 + 18 = 54. So the perimeter of STV is 54. Multiply by the scale factor 7/6: 54*(7/6) = 54 divided by 6 is 9, times 7 is 63. Therefore, the perimeter of RUW would be 63. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 63. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's something wrong here. Let me check the steps again.

First, confirming the correspondence. Since the similarity is stated as Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V), the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So R corresponds to S, U to T, W to V. Therefore, side RU (from R to U) corresponds to side ST (from S to T). Side UW (from U to W) corresponds to side TV (from T to V). Side RW (from R to W) corresponds to side VS (from V to S). So yes, that's correct.

Then, the ratio of similarity is determined by the ratio of corresponding sides. Since UW corresponds to TV, and we're told UW is 21, while TV is 18. So the ratio is 21/18 = 7/6. Therefore, all sides of RUW are 7/6 times those of STV. Hence, the perimeter of RUW is 7/6 times the perimeter of STV.

Calculating perimeter of STV: 24 + 12 + 18 = 54. Multiplying by 7/6: 54 * 7 / 6 = (54 / 6)*7 = 9*7 = 63. So the perimeter is 63, which is option A.

But wait, the problem mentions that in triangle RUW, the side UW is 21, which is given. But according to our calculation, UW corresponds to TV (18) in STV, so scaling factor is 7/6. Therefore, the other sides would be scaled accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can check the other sides. For example, if ST is 24, which corresponds to RU. So RU would be 24 * 7/6 = 28. Then, RW corresponds to VS (12), so RW would be 12 * 7/6 = 14. Then, the perimeter would be RU + UW + RW = 28 + 21 + 14 = 63. Yep, same result. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different correspondence? Let me check again. Suppose someone thought that the correspondence was different. For example, if triangle RUW ~ triangle STV, but the correspondence was different. Like R→S, U→V, W→T? But that would change the correspondence. But the way the similarity is written is important. The order of the letters in the similarity statement defines the correspondence. So Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V) means that angle R corresponds to angle S, angle U to T, angle W to V. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles would correspond. So side opposite R is UW, opposite S is TV. So that's why UW corresponds to TV. So that seems right.

Another way to check: suppose we have triangle STV with sides ST=24, TV=18, VS=12. So triangle STV has sides 24, 18, 12. Wait, but 12, 18, 24 are multiples of 6: 2*6, 3*6, 4*6. So the sides are in ratio 2:3:4. Wait, but 12:18:24 simplifies to 2:3:4 when divided by 6. So the triangle STV has sides in ratio 2:3:4. Then triangle RUW, being similar, would have sides in the same ratio. Let me see. If the ratio of similarity is 7/6, then the sides of RUW would be 2*(7/6), 3*(7/6), 4*(7/6). Wait, but we know that one of the sides is UW = 21, which corresponds to TV = 18. So TV is 18, which in the ratio 2:3:4 corresponds to the middle side. Wait, in triangle STV, the sides are 12 (VS), 18 (TV), 24 (ST). So which is which? If the sides are 12, 18, 24, then the ratios are 12:18:24 = 2:3:4. So if TV is 18, which is the second side. Therefore, in triangle RUW, the corresponding side (UW) would be 21, which is the second side. So the ratio of the sides would be 2:3:4 scaled by 7/6. So the sides of RUW would be 2*(7/6), 3*(7/6), 4*(7/6). Wait, but that would mean:

Original sides of STV: 2x, 3x, 4x. Where x is such that 2x=12 → x=6. So 2x=12, 3x=18, 4x=24. Correct.

Then, triangle RUW has sides 2y, 3y, 4y, where y is the scaling factor. Since UW corresponds to TV (which was 3x=18), and UW is 21. So 3y = 21 → y = 7. Therefore, the sides of RUW are 2*7=14, 3*7=21, 4*7=28. Therefore, the perimeter is 14 + 21 + 28 = 63. Same result. So that confirms the perimeter is 63.

Hence, the answer should be A. 63.

I think that's solid. All methods lead to 63. So the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the **perimeter** of triangle $ \triangle RUW $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric relationships and leveraging the fact that the triangles $ \triangle RUW $ and $ \triangle STV $ are **similar**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Similarity Correspondence

From the problem, we are told:

$$
\text{Triangle}(R, U, W) \sim \text{Triangle}(S, T, V)
$$

This implies that the vertices correspond in the same order:

- $ R \leftrightarrow S $
- $ U \leftrightarrow T $
- $ W \leftrightarrow V $

Thus, the sides of the triangles correspond as follows:

- $ RU \leftrightarrow ST $
- $ UW \leftrightarrow TV $
- $ RW \leftrightarrow VS $

---

### Step 2: Use Known Side Lengths to Find Scale Factor

We are given:

- $ ST = 24 $
- $ VS = 12 $
- $ VT = 18 $
- $ UW = 21 $

Since $ UW \leftrightarrow TV $, we can compute the **scale factor** ($ k $):

$$
k = \frac{\text{Length of } UW}{\text{Length of } TV} = \frac{21}{18} = \frac{7}{6}
$$

This tells us that all sides of $ \triangle RUW $ are $ \frac{7}{6} $ times the corresponding sides of $ \triangle STV $.

---

### Step 3: Compute Perimeter of $ \triangle STV $

We now calculate the perimeter of $ \triangle STV $ using its side lengths:

$$
P_{STV} = ST + VS + VT = 24 + 12 + 18 = 54
$$

---

### Step 4: Compute Perimeter of $ \triangle RUW $

Using the scale factor $ k = \frac{7}{6} $, the perimeter of $ \triangle RUW $ is:

$$
P_{RUW} = P_{STV} \times k = 54 \times \frac{7}{6} = 63
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
