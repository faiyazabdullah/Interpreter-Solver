Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle AEC with point P as its incenter. The question is asking for the measure of angle DEP. Let me recall that the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors of a triangle. Also, there are several perpendicular lines mentioned here, like PF perpendicular to AE, PB perpendicular to AC, PD perpendicular to EC. Plus, some congruences between segments PF, PB, PD. 

First, since P is the incenter, it should lie at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The given information also mentions that lines AP, EP, CP bisect angles EAC, AEC, and ECA respectively. That makes sense because those are the angle bisectors. 

Now, looking at the right angles: Angle AFP, ABP, and CDP are right angles. So points F, B, D are feet of perpendiculars from P onto sides AE, AC, and EC respectively? Wait, but PF is perpendicular to AE, so F lies on AE. Similarly, PB is perpendicular to AC, so B lies on AC. And PD is perpendicular to EC, so D lies on EC. But wait, the problem says Line(A,P) and others. Hmm. Maybe I need to visualize this triangle.

Let me sketch mentally. Triangle AEC. Point P inside it. From P, draw three perpendiculars: PF ⊥ AE (so F is on AE), PB ⊥ AC (so B is on AC), PD ⊥ EC (so D is on EC). Also, PF = PB = PD because they're congruent. Since these are perpendiculars from the incenter to the sides, their lengths should be equal to the inradius. Wait, but in general, the distances from the incenter to each side are equal. Therefore, PF, PB, PD are all equal, which matches the given congruences. So that checks out.

Given angles: Measure of angle FAC is 33 degrees, angle DCA is 28.5 degrees. Wait, angle FAC is angle at A between FA and AC? Or maybe angle at A? Let me check. The notation Angle(F,A,C) means angle at point A between points F and C. So yes, angle FAC is at vertex A. So angle FAC is 33 degrees. Similarly, angle DCA is angle at point C between D and A, so angle DCA is 28.5 degrees. 

We need to find angle DEP. Let me think about how to approach this. Since P is the incenter, perhaps we can use angle bisector properties and some triangle relationships. 

First, let's note down the known angles. In triangle AEC, angles at A, E, and C. We know two angles related to the incenter. Wait, angle FAC is part of angle EAC. Since AP bisects angle EAC, then angle EAP equals angle PAC. But angle FAC is given as 33 degrees. Wait, but how does FAC relate to angle EAC?

Wait, point F is on AE, and PF is perpendicular to AE. So AF is part of AE. So angle FAC would be angle between FA and AC. But since AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC, then angle EAC is split into two equal parts by AP. However, angle FAC is given as 33 degrees. Let me see. If AP is the angle bisector, then angle PAC is half of angle EAC. But angle FAC is adjacent to angle PAC? Wait, maybe not directly. Let me clarify:

Let me denote angle EAC as α. Then, since AP bisects angle EAC, angle EAP = angle PAC = α/2. Now, point F is on AE such that PF is perpendicular to AE. So triangle AFP is a right triangle with right angle at F. Given that angle FAC is 33 degrees, which is angle at A between FA and AC. So in triangle AFC, angle at A is 33 degrees, angle at F is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle at C in triangle AFC would be 180 - 33 - 90 = 57 degrees. Wait, but angle at C in triangle AFC is angle FCA, which is part of angle ECA. Hmm. 

But angle ECA is another angle in triangle AEC. Let me think. Let me write down variables for angles. Let me denote:

Let’s call angle EAC as α. Since AP bisects it, angle PAC = α/2. Similarly, angle AEC is β, and angle ACE is γ. Since P is the incenter, the angles at the center are determined by the formula involving the sum of angles. Also, the given angles FAC = 33°, which is angle between FA (which is along AE) and AC. So angle FAC is angle between AE and AC? No, because F is on AE. So AF is part of AE. So angle FAC is angle between AF (along AE) and AC. So angle FAC is the same as angle between AE and AC, which is angle EAC. Wait, no. Because angle EAC is the angle at A between EA and AC. So if F is on AE, then AF is a segment of AE. Therefore, angle FAC is the same as angle EAC. Wait, but that contradicts the given value of 33 degrees. Unless... unless my understanding is wrong.

Wait, hold on. If angle FAC is measured as angle at A between F and C. So point F is on AE. So line AF is part of AE. So angle FAC is angle between AF (which is along AE) and AC. Therefore, angle FAC is the same as angle EAC. But according to the problem, angle FAC is 33 degrees. So that suggests angle EAC is 33 degrees. Is that possible? Wait, but then angle EAC is 33 degrees. Then angle PAC is half of that, 16.5 degrees. But then angle PAC is part of triangle APC. However, there's also the right angle at F. So in triangle AFP, angle at A is 33 degrees, angle at F is 90 degrees, so angle at P is 180-33-90=57 degrees. So angle APF is 57 degrees. But point P is the incenter, so maybe there's more relations here.

Alternatively, maybe angle FAC isn't the entire angle EAC. Let me think again. Suppose AF is a segment from A to F on AE. Then angle FAC is formed by AF and AC. So if F were at E, then angle FAC would be angle EAC. But since F is somewhere else on AE, then angle FAC is smaller than angle EAC. Wait, but how? For example, suppose F is closer to A. Then AF is shorter. So angle FAC would still be the angle between AF (a portion of AE) and AC. Therefore, angle FAC is part of angle EAC. Therefore, angle EAC is larger than angle FAC. Therefore, angle FAC being 33 degrees implies that angle EAC is greater than 33 degrees. Therefore, my previous thought was incorrect. So angle EAC is something larger than 33 degrees. Therefore, AP bisects angle EAC into two angles, each of measure (EAC)/2. But angle FAC is not necessarily one of those halves. So how do we relate them?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle AFP has angle at A equal to 33 degrees, right angle at F, so angle at P is 57 degrees. But point P is the incenter, so maybe there's a relationship between that angle and other elements.

Similarly, angle DCA is given as 28.5 degrees. That's angle at C between DC and CA. Since PD is perpendicular to EC, point D is on EC. So CD is part of EC. Therefore, angle DCA is the same as angle ECD? Wait, angle DCA is angle at C between DC and CA. Since D is on EC, DC is a segment from C to D on EC. So angle DCA is the same as angle ECD? No, because EC is a straight line. So if D is on EC, then DC is part of EC. So angle DCA is the angle between DC (which is along EC) and CA. Therefore, angle DCA is the same as angle ECA, which is angle at C of triangle AEC. Wait, but angle ECA is angle at C between EC and CA, which is the same as angle DCA if D is on EC. Therefore, angle DCA is equal to angle ECA, which is γ. So given that angle DCA is 28.5 degrees, so γ = 28.5 degrees.

So angle at C is 28.5 degrees. Then, since the sum of angles in triangle AEC is 180 degrees, we can find the third angle. Let me denote angle at E as β. Then:

α + β + γ = 180

We already have γ = 28.5 degrees. But we don't know α yet. However, angle FAC is given as 33 degrees. How does that help us? Earlier confusion arises here. Let me re-examine.

Since angle FAC is at point A between F and C. Since F is on AE, then AF is part of AE. Therefore, angle FAC is angle between AF (on AE) and AC. Which is part of angle EAC. Let me consider triangle AFE? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates might help, but maybe that's too involved. Alternatively, since AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC, then angle EAP = angle PAC = α/2. But angle FAC is different. Let me think of AF as a segment from A to F on AE. Then, angle FAC is the angle between AF and AC. So if I imagine extending or considering triangle AFC. 

Alternatively, since PF is perpendicular to AE, triangle AFP is right-angled at F. So in triangle AFP, angle at A is 33 degrees, angle at F is 90 degrees, so angle at P is 57 degrees. So angle APF is 57 degrees. But point P is the incenter, so maybe there's a way to relate this angle with other angles in the triangle. 

Also, since AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC, angle EAP = angle PAC = α/2. Let me think about triangle APC. In triangle APC, we have angle PAC = α/2, angle PCA is angle at C, which is γ = 28.5 degrees. Then, angle APC can be found as 180 - (α/2 + 28.5). But angle APC is also related to the other angles. However, I'm not sure how that connects with the earlier 57 degrees from triangle AFP.

Alternatively, since angle APF is 57 degrees, and angle APC is part of the triangle. Wait, but APF is part of triangle AFP, while APC is another triangle. Maybe there's a relation between those angles. Let me consider that PF is perpendicular to AE, so PF is the altitude from P to AE. Since P is the incenter, the distance from P to AE is equal to the inradius. Similarly, PB and PD are also equal to the inradius. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use trigonometry in triangle AFP. In triangle AFP, right-angled at F, with angle at A being 33 degrees, so tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = PF / AF. But PF is the inradius r, and AF can be expressed in terms of other quantities. However, without knowing the sides, this might be tricky. But maybe we can relate it to the angle bisector. 

Alternatively, since AP bisects angle EAC into two equal parts, and angle FAC is 33 degrees. Let me assume that angle EAC is composed of angle EAF plus angle FAC? Wait, no. Since F is on AE, AF is part of AE. So angle FAC is the angle between AF (which is along AE) and AC. Therefore, angle FAC is the same as angle EAC only if F coincides with E. But since F is a distinct point (as there's a perpendicular from P to AE), it's somewhere along AE. Therefore, angle FAC is less than angle EAC. Hence, angle EAC = angle FAC + angle PAC? No, that may not be accurate. Let me think again. 

If you have point F on AE, then AF is a segment from A to F. Then, angle FAC is the angle between AF and AC. If you extend AF beyond F to E, then angle EAC is the total angle at A between EA and AC. So angle EAC is made up of angle EAF (from EA to AF) plus angle FAC (from AF to AC). Wait, no. If F is between A and E, then AF is part of AE. So angle between AF and AC is angle FAC, and angle between AE and AC is angle EAC. So angle EAC is equal to angle FAC plus angle FAE? Wait, no. Wait, angle EAC is the angle between EA and AC. Since AF is along EA, then angle between AF and AC is the same as angle EAC. Wait, this seems conflicting with earlier thoughts. 

Wait, if you have a point F on AE, then AF is just a segment of AE. So the direction from A to F is the same as from A to E. Therefore, the angle between AF and AC is the same as the angle between AE and AC, which is angle EAC. Therefore, angle FAC is equal to angle EAC. But according to the problem, angle FAC is 33 degrees. So that suggests angle EAC is 33 degrees. But then angle EAC = α = 33 degrees. Then, since P is the incenter, angle PAC = α/2 = 16.5 degrees. 

But then in triangle AFP, which is right-angled at F, angle at A is 33 degrees, angle at F is 90 degrees, so angle at P is 57 degrees. This angle at P (angle APF) is 57 degrees. But angle APF is part of the angle at P in triangle APC. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Point P is connected to A, E, C. So AP is an angle bisector. PF is perpendicular to AE. So AP goes from A to P, and PF is perpendicular to AE. So angle APF is between AP and PF. But how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, since AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC (which we've assumed is 33 degrees), then angle PAC is 16.5 degrees. In triangle APC, we have angle at A as 16.5 degrees, angle at C as 28.5 degrees (γ), so angle at P (angle APC) is 180 - 16.5 - 28.5 = 135 degrees. So angle APC is 135 degrees. But earlier, from triangle AFP, we had angle APF as 57 degrees. How do these relate? 

Well, angle APC is the angle at P between A and C. But angle APF is part of that angle. If we consider that PF is perpendicular to AE, then line PF is perpendicular to AE. So line PF is perpendicular to AE, and AP is the angle bisector. Perhaps there's a way to relate these angles. 

Let me consider triangle APF. It has angles 33°, 90°, and 57°, as before. So angle at P is 57°, which is angle APF. Now, angle APC is 135°, which includes angle APF? Not sure. Because point F is on AE, and P is inside the triangle. So line PF is going from P to F on AE. So angle APF is part of angle APC? Wait, if we look at point P, connected to A and C. The line PF is from P to F on AE. So AP is one side, and PC is another. But PF is a separate line. So angle APF is between AP and PF. While angle APC is between AP and PC. So unless PF is aligned with PC, which it isn't. Therefore, angle APF and angle APC are different angles. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction if angle EAC is 33 degrees, leading to angle APC being 135°, but also having angle APF as 57°, which may not directly conflict. However, this seems confusing. Maybe my assumption that angle EAC is 33 degrees is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps angle FAC is not the same as angle EAC. Let me take a different approach. Let me denote angle EAC as α. Since AP is the angle bisector, angle PAC = α/2. Now, in triangle AFP, which is right-angled at F, angle at A is angle FAC. What is angle FAC in terms of α? 

Since F is on AE, and AF is part of AE. So angle FAC is the angle between AF (which is along AE) and AC. So angle FAC is equal to angle between AE and AC, which is angle EAC, α. Wait, but this brings us back to the same conclusion. So angle FAC = α. But the problem states that angle FAC is 33 degrees. So α = 33°. Then angle PAC = 16.5°, as above. 

But then angle APC in triangle APC is 180 - angle PAC - angle PCA = 180 - 16.5 - 28.5 = 135°, as before. 

However, in triangle AFP, angle at P is 57°, which is angle APF. So angle APF = 57°. Now, since P is the incenter, the sum of angles around P might give us some relations. But I'm not seeing it immediately. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that PB is perpendicular to AC, so triangle APB is right-angled at B. Similarly, given that AB is length 10.9. Wait, the problem gives LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = 10.9. But point B is on AC, since PB is perpendicular to AC. So AB is part of AC. Wait, no. Wait, point B is on AC? Or is it on another side? Let me check. 

The problem states: Line(A,P), Line(E,P), Line(C,P), Line(P,F), Line(P,B), Line(P,D). Also, Perpendicular(Line(P,F), Line(A,E)), so PF ⊥ AE. Perpendicular(Line(P,B), Line(A,C)), so PB ⊥ AC. Perpendicular(Line(P,D), Line(E,C)), so PD ⊥ EC. So point B is on AC, since PB is perpendicular to AC. Similarly, D is on EC, and F is on AE. 

Therefore, point B is on AC, and AB has length 10.9. Also, given that RightAngle(Angle(A,B,P)), meaning triangle ABP is right-angled at B. So in triangle ABP, right-angled at B, with AB = 10.9. Also, since PB is perpendicular to AC, and P is the incenter. 

Similarly, in triangle AFP, right-angled at F, with AF being part of AE. And PF is the inradius. Also, given that LengthOf(Line(A,F)) = 13. 

So AF = 13 units. 

So in triangle AFP, right-angled at F, AF = 13, angle at A is 33°, so we can compute PF (the inradius) using trigonometry. 

In triangle AFP: 
tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = PF / AF => tan(33°) = PF / 13 => PF = 13 * tan(33°). 

Calculating tan(33°): approximately tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494. So PF ≈ 13 * 0.6494 ≈ 8.442. 

Similarly, in triangle ABP, right-angled at B, AB = 10.9. Let me denote PB as the inradius r, same as PF and PD. So in triangle ABP, tan(angle at A) would be PB / AB. Wait, angle at A in triangle ABP is angle between AB and AP. Wait, but AP is the angle bisector. 

Wait, angle at A in triangle ABP is angle between AB and AP. Let me denote that angle as θ. Since AB is part of AC, and AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC (which is α = 33°). So angle between AB (which is along AC) and AP is angle PAC, which is α/2 = 16.5°. So in triangle ABP, right-angled at B, angle at A is 16.5°, so tan(theta) = PB / AB => tan(16.5°) = r / 10.9 => r = 10.9 * tan(16.5°). 

Let me calculate tan(16.5°): approximately tan(16.5) ≈ 0.296. So r ≈ 10.9 * 0.296 ≈ 3.226. 

But earlier, from triangle AFP, r ≈ 8.442. These values are inconsistent. That suggests that my assumption that angle EAC is 33° is wrong. So there's a contradiction here. Hence, my earlier reasoning must be flawed. 

Where did I go wrong? Ah! I assumed that angle FAC is equal to angle EAC, but that can't be true. Instead, angle FAC is not the full angle EAC, because F is not at E. So angle FAC is a part of angle EAC. Therefore, angle EAC is larger than 33 degrees. Let me correct this. 

Let me denote angle EAC as α. Then, angle FAC is a portion of α. To find the relation between α and the given angle FAC = 33°, I need to consider the position of F. Since PF is perpendicular to AE, and P is the incenter. 

But how can I relate this? Maybe using the fact that in triangle AFP, which is right-angled at F, with AF = 13, angle at A is angle FAC = 33°, so we can express PF in terms of AF and the tangent of angle FAC. As before, PF = AF * tan(angle FAC) = 13 * tan(33°). 

Additionally, since P is the incenter, the distance from P to AC (which is PB) is also equal to the inradius r. In triangle ABP, right-angled at B, with AB = 10.9, angle at A is angle between AB and AP. Let me call this angle φ. Since AP bisects angle EAC (α), then angle between AP and AC is α/2. But AB is along AC, so angle between AP and AB is α/2. Therefore, in triangle ABP, angle at A is α/2. Thus, tan(φ) = PB / AB => PB = AB * tan(φ) = 10.9 * tan(α/2). 

But since both PF and PB are radii, they should be equal. So:

PF = PB  
=> 13 * tan(33°) = 10.9 * tan(α/2)  

So we can solve for α/2:

tan(α/2) = (13 * tan(33°)) / 10.9  

Calculate left side: tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494, so numerator ≈ 13 * 0.6494 ≈ 8.4422. Divided by 10.9 gives ≈ 8.4422 / 10.9 ≈ 0.7745. 

So tan(α/2) ≈ 0.7745. Taking arctangent: α/2 ≈ arctan(0.7745). Calculating that, arctan(0.7745) is approx 37.8 degrees. Hence, α ≈ 75.6 degrees. 

So angle EAC (α) is approximately 75.6 degrees. 

Then, since in triangle AEC, angles sum to 180°, and angle at C is γ = 28.5°, we can find angle at E (β):

α + β + γ = 180  
75.6 + β + 28.5 = 180  
β = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 180 - 104.1 = 75.9 degrees. 

So angle at E is approximately 75.9 degrees. 

Now, since P is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, the angles at the incenter can be calculated based on the triangle's angles. 

But the question asks for angle DEP. Let me think about how to find that. 

Point D is on EC, and PD is perpendicular to EC. Also, since P is the incenter, PD is the inradius. Similarly, PE is the angle bisector of angle E. Wait, no. The incenter's angle bisectors are AP (bisecting angle at A), EP (bisecting angle at E), and CP (bisecting angle at C). 

So, angle at E is β ≈ 75.9 degrees, so angle BEP (if B were on AE) would be β/2. But we need angle DEP. Point D is on EC, and PD is perpendicular to EC. So let me consider triangle PDE or something similar. 

Let me focus on point D on EC. Since PD is perpendicular to EC, and P is the incenter. Also, angle DCA is 28.5°, which we've denoted as γ = angle ECA = 28.5°, which matches the given data. 

To find angle DEP, let me consider triangle DEP. Points D, E, P. Need to find angle at P: angle DEP. 

Alternatively, since PD is perpendicular to EC, and PE is the angle bisector of angle E. Let me consider the relationship between PD and PE. 

Let me try to find coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help. Let me place point A at origin, and build coordinate system. 

Let me set coordinate system: Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me assume that AE is along x-axis. So point E is somewhere along x-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Let me define:

- Point A at (0,0).

- Since AE is a line, let me set point E at (e, 0) for some e > 0.

- Point C is somewhere in plane. Given that angle EAC is α ≈ 75.6 degrees, and length AE is given as 14.9 units. Wait, the problem says LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = 14.9. So AE = 14.9. 

So AE is from (0,0) to (14.9, 0). Let me fix this. So coordinates:

A = (0, 0)

E = (14.9, 0)

Now, need to find coordinates of C. Given that angle EAC is α ≈ 75.6 degrees, and AC is another side. Also, given that angle at C is γ = 28.5 degrees. 

But maybe it's easier to use the Law of Sines on triangle AEC. 

In triangle AEC, angles are:

At A: α ≈ 75.6°

At E: β ≈ 75.9°

At C: γ = 28.5°

Using Law of Sines:

AE / sin(γ) = EC / sin(α) = AC / sin(β)

Given AE = 14.9, γ = 28.5°, α ≈ 75.6°, β ≈ 75.9°.

Compute EC:

EC = (AE * sin(α)) / sin(γ) ≈ (14.9 * sin(75.6°)) / sin(28.5°)

Calculate sin(75.6°): approx sin(75.6) ≈ 0.9686

sin(28.5°) ≈ 0.4771

Thus, EC ≈ (14.9 * 0.9686) / 0.4771 ≈ (14.43) / 0.4771 ≈ 30.25 units.

Similarly, AC = (AE * sin(β)) / sin(γ) ≈ (14.9 * sin(75.9°)) / 0.4771

sin(75.9°) ≈ 0.9698

So AC ≈ (14.9 * 0.9698) / 0.4771 ≈ (14.45) / 0.4771 ≈ 30.29 units.

So approximate lengths: EC ≈ 30.25, AC ≈ 30.29. Close enough, considering rounding errors. 

Now, coordinates of C can be determined. Since we placed A at (0,0), E at (14.9, 0). Let me find coordinates of C. Let me assume that AC makes an angle α ≈ 75.6° with AE (x-axis). So coordinates of C can be determined as follows:

From point A (0,0), moving along direction making angle α with x-axis. The length AC is approx 30.29. So coordinates of C are:

C_x = AC * cos(α) ≈ 30.29 * cos(75.6°)

cos(75.6°) ≈ 0.25

Wait, cos(75.6°) is cos(75.6) ≈ cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588, cos(76°) ≈ 0.2419. Let me calculate cos(75.6°). Using calculator input: cos(75.6°). Let me convert to radians for calculation? Well, alternatively, use approximate value. Let me use exact computation. 

Alternatively, since α is approximately 75.6°, and we can calculate cos(α) and sin(α). Let me proceed with approximate values:

cos(75.6°) ≈ cos(75° + 0.6°) ≈ cos(75°)cos(0.6°) - sin(75°)sin(0.6°). Cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588, sin(75°) ≈ 0.9659. Cos(0.6°) ≈ 0.9999, sin(0.6°) ≈ 0.0105. So:

≈ 0.2588*0.9999 - 0.9659*0.0105 ≈ 0.2588 - 0.0101 ≈ 0.2487. 

Similarly, sin(75.6°) ≈ sin(75°+0.6°) ≈ sin(75°)*cos(0.6°) + cos(75°)*sin(0.6°) ≈ 0.9659*0.9999 + 0.2588*0.0105 ≈ 0.9659 + 0.0027 ≈ 0.9686. 

So coordinates of C:

C_x = AC * cos(α) ≈ 30.29 * 0.2487 ≈ 7.53

C_y = AC * sin(α) ≈ 30.29 * 0.9686 ≈ 29.33

So approximate coordinates:

C ≈ (7.53, 29.33)

Now, we can find coordinates of P, the incenter. The incenter coordinates can be found using the formula weighted by the lengths of the sides. 

In general, the coordinates of the incenter (I_x, I_y) are given by:

I_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a+b+c)

I_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a+b+c)

where a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to vertices A, B, C. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. But in our case, triangle AEC, with vertices A, E, C. Let me adjust accordingly.

Let me denote:

In triangle AEC,

- Side opposite to A is EC, which has length a = EC ≈ 30.25

- Side opposite to E is AC, which has length b = AC ≈ 30.29

- Side opposite to C is AE, which has length c = AE = 14.9

Therefore, incenter coordinates:

I_x = (a*A_x + b*E_x + c*C_x) / (a + b + c)

I_y = (a*A_y + b*E_y + c*C_y) / (a + b + c)

Plugging in:

A_x = 0, A_y = 0

E_x = 14.9, E_y = 0

C_x ≈ 7.53, C_y ≈ 29.33

So:

Numerator for I_x:

a*A_x + b*E_x + c*C_x = 30.25*0 + 30.29*14.9 + 14.9*7.53

Calculate:

First term: 0

Second term: 30.29 * 14.9 ≈ Let's compute 30 * 14.9 = 447, 0.29 * 14.9 ≈ 4.321 → Total ≈ 447 + 4.321 = 451.321

Third term: 14.9 * 7.53 ≈ 14.9 * 7 + 14.9 * 0.53 ≈ 104.3 + 7.897 ≈ 112.197

Total numerator I_x ≈ 451.321 + 112.197 ≈ 563.518

Denominator: a + b + c ≈ 30.25 + 30.29 + 14.9 ≈ 75.44

So I_x ≈ 563.518 / 75.44 ≈ 7.47

Numerator for I_y:

a*A_y + b*E_y + c*C_y = 30.25*0 + 30.29*0 + 14.9*29.33 ≈ 0 + 0 + 14.9*29.33 ≈ Let's compute 14.9 * 29.33:

Approximate as 15 * 29.33 = 439.95 minus 0.1 * 29.33 = 2.933 → 439.95 - 2.933 ≈ 437.02

So I_y ≈ 437.02 / 75.44 ≈ 5.79

So approximate coordinates of incenter P are (7.47, 5.79)

Now, need to find angle DEP. Point D is on EC, and PD is perpendicular to EC. Let me find coordinates of D first.

Point D is on EC such that PD is perpendicular to EC. Since PD is perpendicular to EC, and P is the incenter, D is the foot of perpendicular from P to EC. 

First, find equation of line EC. Points E (14.9, 0) and C (7.53, 29.33). Let me compute slope of EC:

m_EC = (29.33 - 0) / (7.53 - 14.9) = 29.33 / (-7.37) ≈ -3.98

Equation of EC: y - 0 = m_EC(x - 14.9)

So y = -3.98(x - 14.9)

Now, find foot of perpendicular from P(7.47, 5.79) to line EC. The formula for foot of perpendicular from point (x0,y0) to line ax + by + c = 0 is known, but let me derive it.

First, write line EC in standard form. Let me rearrange y = -3.98x + 3.98*14.9. Compute 3.98 * 14.9:

Approximately 4 * 14.9 = 59.6; subtract 0.02 * 14.9 = 0.298 → 59.6 - 0.298 ≈ 59.302

So equation of EC: y = -3.98x + 59.302 → 3.98x + y - 59.302 = 0

So coefficients: a = 3.98, b = 1, c = -59.302

Foot of perpendicular from P(7.47, 5.79) to this line is given by:

x = x0 - a*(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)

y = y0 - b*(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)

Compute ax0 + by0 + c = 3.98*7.47 + 1*5.79 - 59.302

Calculate:

First term: 3.98 * 7.47 ≈ Let's compute 4 * 7.47 = 29.88, subtract 0.02 * 7.47 = 0.1494 → 29.88 - 0.1494 ≈ 29.73

Add second term: +5.79 → 29.73 + 5.79 = 35.52

Subtract c: 35.52 - 59.302 = -23.782

Denominator a² + b² = (3.98)^2 + 1^2 ≈ 15.84 + 1 = 16.84

Thus, x = 7.47 - 3.98*(-23.782)/16.84 ≈ 7.47 + (3.98 * 23.782)/16.84

Calculate 3.98 * 23.782 ≈ 3.98 * 23.78 ≈ Let me approximate:

4 * 23.78 = 95.12, subtract 0.02 * 23.78 = 0.4756 → 95.12 - 0.4756 ≈ 94.644

Divide by 16.84: 94.644 / 16.84 ≈ 5.62

So x ≈ 7.47 + 5.62 ≈ 13.09

Similarly, y = 5.79 - 1*(-23.782)/16.84 ≈ 5.79 + 23.782 / 16.84 ≈ 5.79 + 1.412 ≈ 7.20

So coordinates of D are approximately (13.09, 7.20)

Now, we need to find angle DEP. Points D, E, P. So angle at E between D and P. Wait, no: angle DEP is the angle at point E between points D and P. Wait, no: angle DEP is the angle at point E between points D and P? Wait, no. The notation ∠DEP means angle at point E, between points D, E, P. Wait, no: angle at point E between D-E-P. Wait, no. Angle DEP is the angle at point E between points D, E, P? Or at point P? Wait, no. In angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠DEP is angle at point E between points D, E, P. Wait, no. Wait, D-E-P: the angle at point E between D and P. Wait, no, that would be angle at E between D and P. Wait, but point D is on EC, and point P is inside the triangle. So angle DEP is at E, between D and P. 

Wait, but point D is on EC. So ED is part of EC. And EP is from E to P. So angle between ED (which is along EC) and EP. 

Wait, but in this case, angle DEP is the angle at E between D and P. So, it's the angle between ED and EP. Since ED is along EC (since D is on EC), and EP is the line from E to P. So we need to find the angle between EC and EP at point E. 

But since P is the incenter, EP is the angle bisector of angle at E. So angle between EP and EC is half of angle at E. 

Wait, angle at E is β ≈ 75.9°, so the angle bisector divides it into two angles of β/2 ≈ 37.95°. Therefore, angle between EP and EC is β/2 ≈ 37.95°, which would be the measure of angle DEP. 

Wait, but why? Because ED is along EC, and EP is the angle bisector. So the angle between ED (which is EC) and EP is exactly half of angle at E. 

But the problem states that angle DCA is 28.5°, which we used earlier. But according to this, angle DEP would be β/2 ≈ 37.95°, which is not among the answer choices (A. 28.5, B. 30, C. 31, D. 33). Wait, but maybe my approximation was rough, and the actual precise calculation would yield one of the options. Let me check. 

Earlier, we approximated β as 75.9°, giving β/2 ≈ 37.95°, which isn't listed. However, the given answer choices are 28.5, 30, 31, 33. This suggests that my approach might be missing something. 

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe angle DEP is not β/2. Why? Because ED is along EC, but P is the incenter. However, if EP is the angle bisector of angle E, then angle between EP and EC is indeed β/2. So angle DEP is β/2. But β is angle at E, which we computed as approximately 75.9°, hence β/2 ≈ 37.95°. But none of the options match. 

But wait, the problem gave specific values: angle FAC = 33°, angle DCA = 28.5°, and asked for angle DEP. Perhaps there's a better way to find β precisely. 

Let me revisit the earlier equations. We had:

From triangle AFP: PF = 13 * tan(33°)

From triangle ABP: PB = 10.9 * tan(α/2)

Since PF = PB, so:

13 * tan(33°) = 10.9 * tan(α/2)

Let me calculate tan(33°) accurately. Using calculator, tan(33°) ≈ 0.649407593. So:

13 * 0.649407593 ≈ 8.4423 

So 8.4423 = 10.9 * tan(α/2) ⇒ tan(α/2) ≈ 8.4423 / 10.9 ≈ 0.7745 

Then, α/2 ≈ arctan(0.7745). Let me calculate this precisely. 

Using a calculator, arctan(0.7745) is approximately 37.8 degrees. Hence, α/2 ≈ 37.8°, so α ≈ 75.6°, as before. 

Then, in triangle AEC, angles:

α + β + γ = 180  
75.6 + β + 28.5 = 180  
β = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 75.9°, as before. 

So β/2 ≈ 37.95°, which is close to 38°, but none of the options match. However, the answer choices include 33°, 30°, etc. This suggests that my assumption that angle DEP is β/2 is wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps angle DEP is not β/2. Let me think differently. 

Point D is on EC, and PD is perpendicular to EC. So PD is the altitude from P to EC. Since P is the incenter, the distance from P to EC is the inradius r. Also, since PD is perpendicular to EC, and we can find coordinates of D as done earlier. 

But we need to find angle DEP. Let me consider triangle DEP. At point E, angle DEP is formed by ED (along EC) and EP. To find this angle, we can use coordinates. 

Earlier, we found coordinates of E (14.9, 0), D (approx (13.09, 7.20)), and P (approx (7.47, 5.79)). 

Let me compute vectors ED and EP to find angle between them at E. 

Vector ED is D - E = (13.09 - 14.9, 7.20 - 0) = (-1.81, 7.20)

Vector EP is P - E = (7.47 - 14.9, 5.79 - 0) = (-7.43, 5.79)

The angle between vectors ED and EP can be found via dot product:

cos(theta) = (ED • EP) / (|ED| |EP|)

Compute ED • EP = (-1.81)(-7.43) + (7.20)(5.79) ≈ 13.42 + 41.79 ≈ 55.21

|ED| = sqrt((-1.81)^2 + 7.20^2) ≈ sqrt(3.28 + 51.84) ≈ sqrt(55.12) ≈ 7.42

|EP| = sqrt((-7.43)^2 + 5.79^2) ≈ sqrt(55.2 + 33.5) ≈ sqrt(88.7) ≈ 9.42

So cos(theta) ≈ 55.21 / (7.42 * 9.42) ≈ 55.21 / 70.0 ≈ 0.7887

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(0.7887) ≈ 37.9 degrees. 

Which confirms the earlier result of ~38 degrees. But this is not among the answer choices. The closest option is B. 30, C. 31, or D. 33. None are very close. However, this suggests that either my calculations are off due to approximations, or there's a different approach. 

Wait, let me check if there's a property I missed. Since P is the incenter, and PD is perpendicular to EC, then PD is the inradius, and ED is part of EC. Also, the angle DEP is the angle between EC and EP. Since EP is the angle bisector of angle E, this angle should be β/2. But according to the calculation, β/2 ≈ 37.9°, which is not in options. But the given answer choices include 28.5, 30, 31, 33. 

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in assuming that angle DEP is β/2. Let me think again. 

Wait, angle DEP is at point E, between D and P. But ED is along EC, and EP is the angle bisector. So angle between ED (EC) and EP is indeed β/2. But why isn't this matching with the answer choices? 

Wait, let's revisit the calculation of β. Earlier, I used approximate values for α and β. Let me attempt to calculate β more accurately. 

From the equation:

tan(α/2) = (13 * tan(33°)) / 10.9 

Let me compute this more accurately. 

First, calculate tan(33°):

Using calculator, tan(33°) = 0.649407593...

So 13 * tan(33°) = 13 * 0.649407593 ≈ 8.4423 

Divide by 10.9: 8.4423 / 10.9 ≈ 0.774523

Now, α/2 = arctan(0.774523). Let me calculate this precisely. 

Using a calculator, arctan(0.774523) is approximately 37.8 degrees. Let me verify:

tan(37.8°) ≈ tan(37°48') ≈ tan(37.8) ≈ 0.7745. Yes, so α/2 = 37.8°, thus α = 75.6°. 

Then, β = 180 - α - γ = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 75.9°, as before. 

So β/2 = 37.95°, which is approximately 38°. 

But none of the options are close to 38°. The closest is D. 33°, but that's quite far. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in assuming that angle DEP is β/2. 

Wait, let me think about the configuration. Since PD is perpendicular to EC, and P is the incenter, then PD is the inradius. Also, the length of PD is equal to the inradius r. 

Also, since PB is perpendicular to AC, and PF is perpendicular to AE, and all are equal to r. 

But maybe there's another relationship. Let me think about triangle EDP. 

Alternatively, since angle DEP is formed at E, and EP is the angle bisector of angle E, then angle DEP is indeed β/2. But why isn't this matching with the options? 

Wait, maybe my calculation of β is wrong. Let me recheck. 

We have angle FAC = 33°, which is angle between AF and AC. But earlier, I assumed that this is related to α. However, if α is angle EAC, then angle FAC is not α, but a portion of it. Let me try to find α properly. 

Let me consider triangle AFP, right-angled at F, with AF = 13, angle at A = 33°, so PF = AF * tan(33°) = 13 * tan(33°). 

Also, since P is the incenter, the distance from P to AC is r = PB, which is equal to PF. In triangle ABP, right-angled at B, with AB = 10.9, and angle at A is angle between AB and AP. Since AP is the angle bisector of angle EAC = α, then angle between AP and AB is α/2. So in triangle ABP, tan(angle at A) = PB / AB → tan(α/2) = r / 10.9. 

But r = 13 * tan(33°), so:

tan(α/2) = (13 * tan(33°)) / 10.9 

As before, leading to α/2 ≈ 37.8°, α ≈ 75.6°. 

Then, in triangle AEC, angles: α + β + γ = 180 → β = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 75.9°. 

Thus, β/2 = 37.95°, which is approximately 38°. 

But the answer choices are 28.5, 30, 31, 33. This suggests that either there's an error in the assumptions, or perhaps the question refers to a different angle. 

Wait, let me read the question again: "Find m∠DEP." 

Maybe I misread the angle. Is it ∠DEP or ∠PED? Or is it at point P? 

No, the notation ∠DEP means the angle at E, between D and P. 

But perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me think about the diagram. 

Point D is on EC, and PD is perpendicular to EC. So PD is perpendicular to EC, and P is the incenter. So in triangle EDC, PD is the height from P to EC. 

But angle DEP is at E. Let me think about triangle EDP. 

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities with the given angles. 

Wait, given that angle DCA = 28.5°, which is angle at C between D and A, which is γ = 28.5°, as established. 

Also, angle FAC = 33°, which relates to α. 

But perhaps there's a way to find angle DEP using the fact that P is the incenter and the given angles. 

Let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter forms angles with the vertices. The angles at the incenter can be calculated as 90° + half the original angle. 

Wait, the measure of the angle formed at the incenter between two angle bisectors is 90° + half the original angle. For example, angle at P between AP and EP is 90° + (angle at C)/2. Wait, no, the formula is: In a triangle, the measure of the angle at the incenter between two angle bisectors is equal to 90° plus half the measure of the third angle. 

For example, in triangle ABC, with incenter I, the angle ∠AIB = 90° + (1/2)∠C. 

Similarly, angle ∠BIC = 90° + (1/2)∠A, and ∠AIC = 90° + (1/2)∠B. 

Applying this to our triangle AEC, with incenter P. 

So, angle at P between EP and CP is 90° + (1/2)∠A = 90° + α/2. 

But how does this help with angle DEP? 

Wait, angle DEP is at E, between D and P. Let me think about the relationships. 

Since PD is perpendicular to EC, and P is the incenter, perhaps there's a way to relate this with other angles. 

Alternatively, let me consider triangle EDP. In this triangle, we know PD is the inradius r, ED is a segment on EC, and EP is the angle bisector. 

But without knowing the exact lengths, it's hard to apply trigonometry. 

Alternatively, since PD is perpendicular to EC, and EP is the angle bisector, maybe we can use some properties. 

Let me consider that in triangle EPC, PD is the altitude from P to EC. So in triangle EPC, PD is the height. 

But I need to find angle at E, which is angle DEP. 

Alternatively, let me use coordinates again, but with more precise calculations. 

Previously, I estimated β ≈ 75.9°, leading to angle DEP ≈ 37.95°. But this doesn't match any options. Maybe there's a calculation error. 

Let me re-calculate β using exact expressions. 

From earlier, we have:

tan(α/2) = (13 * tan(33°)) / 10.9 

Let me calculate this precisely:

First, calculate tan(33°):

Using a calculator, tan(33°) ≈ 0.649407593

Multiply by 13: 13 * 0.649407593 = 8.44230

Divide by 10.9: 8.44230 / 10.9 ≈ 0.774523

Now, α/2 = arctan(0.774523). Let me use a calculator to find this angle. 

Using a calculator, arctan(0.774523) is approximately 37.8 degrees. Let's verify:

tan(37.8°) = tan(37°48') ≈ 0.7745, which matches. So α/2 = 37.8°, hence α = 75.6°. 

Now, β = 180 - α - γ = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 75.9°, as before. 

Thus, β/2 = 37.95°, which is approximately 38°. 

But the answer choices are 28.5, 30, 31, 33. The closest is D. 33°, but it's still 5° off. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that angle DEP is β/2. Let me think about this. 

If EP is the angle bisector of angle E, then it splits angle E into two equal parts. Since ED is along EC, the angle between ED (EC) and EP is indeed β/2. But why is this not matching the options? 

Wait, let me check the initial problem statement again. It says: "IsIncenterOf(Point(P),Triangle(A,E,C))". So P is the incenter. Also, "BisectsAngle(Line(A,P),Angle(E,A,C))", which means AP bisects angle at A, "BisectsAngle(Line(E,P),Angle(A,E,C))" means EP bisects angle at E, and "BisectsAngle(Line(C,P),Angle(E,C,A))" means CP bisects angle at C. 

So, EP is the bisector of angle at E, which is β. Hence, angle between EP and EC is β/2. 

But why isn't this matching the answer choices? Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of β. Let me check if there's another way to calculate β. 

Let me use the Law of Sines in triangle AEC. 

We have:

AE / sin(γ) = EC / sin(α) = AC / sin(β)

We know AE = 14.9, γ = 28.5°, α = 75.6°, β = 75.9°. 

Let me verify if these satisfy the Law of Sines. 

Compute EC = (AE * sin(α)) / sin(γ) = (14.9 * sin(75.6°)) / sin(28.5°)

Let me calculate sin(75.6°) and sin(28.5°) more precisely. 

Using calculator:

sin(75.6°) ≈ sin(75° + 0.6°) ≈ sin(75°)cos(0.6°) + cos(75°)sin(0.6°). 

sin(75°) ≈ 0.9659258263

cos(0.6°) ≈ 0.999939

cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588190451

sin(0.6°) ≈ 0.0104719755

So:

sin(75.6°) ≈ 0.9659258263 * 0.999939 + 0.2588190451 * 0.0104719755 ≈ 0.9659 + 0.00271 ≈ 0.96861

sin(28.5°) ≈ sin(28.5) ≈ 0.47716982

So EC ≈ (14.9 * 0.96861) / 0.47716982 ≈ (14.4323) / 0.47716982 ≈ 30.25 units, as before.

Similarly, AC = (AE * sin(β)) / sin(γ) = (14.9 * sin(75.9°)) / 0.47716982

Calculate sin(75.9°): 75.9° is 75° + 0.9°. Let me use calculator for precision: sin(75.9°) ≈ 0.9698

So AC ≈ (14.9 * 0.9698) / 0.47716982 ≈ (14.45) / 0.47716982 ≈ 30.29, as before. 

These are consistent. 

Now, let me calculate β using the Law of Cosines. In triangle AEC, using sides:

AE = 14.9, EC ≈ 30.25, AC ≈ 30.29

Law of Cosines: 

cos(β) = (AE² + AC² - EC²) / (2 * AE * AC)

Let me compute this:

AE² = 14.9² = 222.01

AC² ≈ 30.29² ≈ 917.4841

EC² ≈ 30.25² ≈ 915.0625

So:

cos(β) = (222.01 + 917.4841 - 915.0625) / (2 * 14.9 * 30.29)

Numerator: 222.01 + 917.4841 = 1139.4941 - 915.0625 = 224.4316

Denominator: 2 * 14.9 * 30.29 ≈ 29.8 * 30.29 ≈ 899.542

So cos(β) ≈ 224.4316 / 899.542 ≈ 0.2495

Thus, β ≈ arccos(0.2495) ≈ 77.7 degrees. 

Wait, this conflicts with the previous calculation of β ≈ 75.9°. This discrepancy suggests that my earlier assumption about β is incorrect. 

What's the issue here? Let me recalculate β using this Law of Cosines result. 

If cos(β) ≈ 0.2495, then β ≈ 77.7°, which is different from the earlier 75.9°. This indicates an inconsistency, likely due to the approximations in calculating α. 

Let me trace back. Earlier, we calculated α/2 = 37.8°, leading to α = 75.6°, and β = 180 - 75.6 - 28.5 = 75.9°. But with Law of Cosines, β is 77.7°. This suggests that my earlier calculation of α is inaccurate. 

Where is the error? Let me re-express the relationship between α and β. 

From the equation: tan(α/2) = (13 * tan(33°)) / 10.9 

Let me calculate this precisely. 

Let me use more precise values:

tan(33°) = 0.649407593

13 * tan(33°) = 8.442298709

Divide by 10.9: 8.442298709 / 10.9 = 0.774523734

Now, α/2 = arctan(0.774523734). Let me calculate this using a calculator. 

Using a calculator, arctan(0.774523734) is approximately 37.83 degrees. 

So α = 75.66 degrees. 

Now, using this α, let's recalculate β using the Law of Sines. 

In triangle AEC, using Law of Sines:

AE / sin(γ) = EC / sin(α) = AC / sin(β)

Let me calculate EC and AC using this α. 

First, calculate EC = (AE * sin(α)) / sin(γ) 

AE = 14.9, γ = 28.5°, α = 75.66°

sin(α) = sin(75.66°). Let me calculate this precisely. 

Using calculator, sin(75.66°) ≈ 0.9686

So EC ≈ (14.9 * 0.9686) / sin(28.5°) ≈ (14.432) / 0.4771 ≈ 30.25, as before.

Now, AC = (AE * sin(β)) / sin(γ). But we also can calculate AC using Law of Cosines. 

Wait, but I need to find β. Let me use the Law of Cosines with the current α. 

Using Law of Cosines:

cos(β) = (AE² + AC² - EC²) / (2 * AE * AC)

But I don't know AC. Alternatively, use Law of Sines. 

From Law of Sines, AC / sin(β) = EC / sin(α)
