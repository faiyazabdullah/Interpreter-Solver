MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with specific constraints. The question is asking for QM, which I assume refers to the length of segment MQ. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see how they connect.

First, there are points N, A, B, M, P, Q. Then there are lines: NA, NB, MQ, PQ. Angles at N between A and B, and some perpendicularity conditions. Also, points M lies on line NB, point P lies on line NA. Additionally, MQ is perpendicular to NB, and PQ is perpendicular to NA. There's also that line NQ bisects angle ANB. And then there are equations involving lengths of MQ and PQ related to Var, and they're equal. Plus, right angles at angles NMQ and NPQ.

Let me visualize this. Point N is connected to A and B, forming two lines. Points M and P are on NB and NA respectively. Lines MQ and PQ are drawn such that MQ ⊥ NB and PQ ⊥ NA. Also, NQ is the angle bisector of angle ANB. Moreover, the lengths of MQ and PQ are given in terms of Var, and they are equal. Also, the right angles at NMQ and NPQ imply that triangles NMQ and NPQ are right-angled at M and P respectively.

Since MQ is perpendicular to NB and PQ is perpendicular to NA, then MQ and PQ are altitudes? Or maybe something else. Wait, since M is on NB, and MQ is perpendicular to NB, so triangle NMQ has a right angle at M. Similarly, triangle NPQ has a right angle at P.

Also, NQ bisects angle ANB. So NQ is the angle bisector of angle ANB. Maybe using angle bisector theorem here?

Moreover, the lengths of MQ and PQ are equal. Let me note down:

Length(MQ) = 2*Var + 2

Length(PQ) = 4*Var - 8

And Length(MQ) = Length(PQ). Therefore,

2Var + 2 = 4Var - 8

Solving for Var:

Subtract 2Var both sides: 2 = 2Var - 8

Add 8 to both sides: 10 = 2Var → Var = 5.

Wait, but the question asks for QM, which is Length(MQ). Since Length(MQ) = 2Var + 2, substituting Var=5 gives 2*5 +2=12. But wait, let me check again. If Var is 5, then Length(MQ)=2*5+2=12, and Length(PQ)=4*5-8=12 as well. So that checks out.

But wait, the answer choices are A.4, B.8, C.12, D.16. So according to this calculation, the answer would be C.12. However, let me make sure that there isn't another way this could be approached, or if there's something missing here.

Wait, but maybe Var is not directly the variable here? Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)),Add(Mul(2,Var),2)) — so Var is probably a variable defined earlier? Wait, but the problem didn't define Var. Hmm, perhaps Var is referring to something else? Wait, maybe Var is a typo or shorthand for something else. Alternatively, perhaps Var is supposed to be a value derived from the diagram. But given that the equations set Length(MQ) equal to 2Var +2 and Length(PQ) equal to 4Var -8, and since Length(MQ)=Length(PQ), solving gives Var=5, leading to Length(MQ)=12. Therefore, the answer should be C.12.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more to it. For example, maybe there's a relationship between the segments due to the angle bisector and the right angles. Let me think again.

Since NQ is the angle bisector of angle ANB, and considering the right triangles NMQ and NPQ. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates can help.

Let me place point N at the origin (0,0). Let me suppose that line NA is along the x-axis, and line NB is along some line making an angle θ with NA. But since NQ is the angle bisector, then angle between NA and NQ is θ/2.

But since MQ is perpendicular to NB and PQ is perpendicular to NA, then maybe coordinates can be assigned accordingly.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s assume N is at (0,0).

Let’s take line NA as the x-axis. Let’s say point A is at (a, 0) for some a > 0.

Similarly, line NB makes some angle with NA. Let me assume that line NB is in the plane. Let me denote coordinates for point B. But since M lies on NB, and MQ is perpendicular to NB, and P lies on NA, PQ is perpendicular to NA.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinate system with N at origin, NA along x-axis, NB along y-axis? Wait, but angle ANB is being bisected by NQ. Suppose angle ANB is θ, then NQ divides it into two angles of θ/2 each.

But if I take NA as x-axis and NB as y-axis, then angle ANB is 90 degrees. But unless specified, angle ANB could be arbitrary. However, since there are perpendicular lines involved, maybe the angle is 90 degrees? Wait, no, because the right angles are at angles NMQ and NPQ, not necessarily angle ANB itself.

Wait, but if I take NA and NB as perpendicular, then angle ANB is 90 degrees, and its bisector NQ would make 45 degrees with each axis. However, maybe that assumption is not valid unless specified. However, maybe the fact that MQ is perpendicular to NB and PQ is perpendicular to NA implies that triangles NMQ and NPQ are right triangles. 

But regardless, perhaps using coordinate geometry would clarify things.

Let me proceed with coordinates:

Let’s place N at (0,0).

Let’s assume NA is along the x-axis. Let’s take point A at (a, 0).

Let’s take point B somewhere in the plane; since line NB is arbitrary, but M lies on NB. Let me parametrize line NB. Let me suppose that line NB is arbitrary, but since MQ is perpendicular to NB, and M lies on NB, then MQ is the altitude from M to NB? No, because M is on NB, so MQ is perpendicular to NB. That means that Q is the foot of the perpendicular from M onto... Wait, no. Wait, MQ is a line starting at M and perpendicular to NB. But since M is on NB, then line MQ is perpendicular to NB, so Q is a point such that line MQ is perpendicular to NB. But since M is already on NB, then line MQ is perpendicular to NB at point M? Wait, that would mean that Q is a point along the line perpendicular to NB at M. But then, how does that relate to other elements?

Additionally, PQ is perpendicular to NA. Since P lies on NA, then line PQ is perpendicular to NA. So similar logic: line PQ is perpendicular to NA at point P. Therefore, Q lies on the line perpendicular to NA through P.

So, combining these two: Q is the intersection of two lines: the line perpendicular to NB through M, and the line perpendicular to NA through P. Hence, Q is uniquely determined once M and P are chosen. Also, NQ bisects angle ANB.

Moreover, the lengths of MQ and PQ are given in terms of Var, and they are equal. Also, there are right angles at angles NMQ and NPQ, meaning that triangles NMQ and NPQ are right-angled at M and P respectively.

Now, since NQ is the angle bisector of angle ANB, perhaps we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem in triangle ANB: if NQ is the bisector of angle ANB, then AQ / QB = AN / BN. Wait, but Q is not necessarily on AB. Wait, but in our case, Q is constructed via those perpendiculars. Hmm, maybe this approach complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates with N at (0,0), A at (a, 0), and B at (0, b), making NA along x-axis and NB along y-axis. This would make angle ANB a right angle (90 degrees), and its bisector NQ would be the line y=x if a=b, but in general, the angle bisector direction depends on the lengths of NA and NB.

Wait, but if I do that, then angle ANB is 90 degrees, so its bisector NQ would be the line making 45 degrees with both axes. Let me try this setup.

Assume N is at (0,0), A is at (a,0), B is at (0,b). Then line NA is x-axis, line NB is y-axis. Now, point M lies on NB, which is the y-axis. So coordinates of M are (0, m), where m is between 0 and b. Similarly, point P lies on NA, which is x-axis, so coordinates of P are (p, 0), where p is between 0 and a.

Then, line MQ is perpendicular to NB (which is y-axis), so line MQ is horizontal (since perpendicular to vertical line). Therefore, line MQ is horizontal, passing through M (0,m), so equation is y = m. Similarly, line PQ is perpendicular to NA (x-axis), so line PQ is vertical, passing through P(p,0), so equation is x = p.

Therefore, point Q is the intersection of y=m and x=p, so Q is at (p, m). Thus, coordinates of Q are (p, m).

Now, NQ is the line from N(0,0) to Q(p, m). The slope of NQ is m/p. Since NQ is the angle bisector of angle ANB (which is the right angle between x and y axes). In this coordinate system, angle bisector of 90-degree angle between x and y axes is the line y=x, but only if the legs are equal. Wait, but in general, the angle bisector of angle between x and y axes (assuming NA and NB are axes) would depend on the ratio of the lengths of NA and NB. Wait, actually, the Angle Bisector Theorem says that the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides. However, in this case, since Q is not on AB, but rather constructed via perpendiculars, perhaps my coordinate assumption may not hold. Wait, but in this coordinate system, if we want NQ to bisect angle ANB, then the direction vector of NQ should satisfy certain condition.

In standard angle bisector of right angle between x and y axes, when NA and NB are the axes themselves, the angle bisector would be y = x if NA and NB are equal in length. Otherwise, the angle bisector would be different. Wait, but in reality, the angle bisector of the right angle between x and y axes is the line y = x, but only if the legs are of equal length. Wait, no—actually, the angle bisector in a right angle is the line that is equidistant from both axes. So in general, if you have a right angle between two lines, the angle bisector is the line where |x| = |y|. But in our case, since we have a fixed coordinate system with NA along x-axis and NB along y-axis, and assuming that the angle bisector NQ goes through Q(p, m), then the direction of NQ should satisfy the condition of being the angle bisector.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for angle bisector in coordinates. Given two lines, the angle bisector can be found by the formula involving their slopes. But since NA is x-axis and NB is y-axis, the angle between them is 90 degrees. The internal angle bisector would be the line that satisfies the condition that the distance from any point on the bisector to both lines is equal. For the first quadrant, the angle bisector is y = x. So if Q lies on y=x, then NQ is y=x. However, in our case, Q is at (p, m). Therefore, for NQ to be the angle bisector, it must lie on y=x, implying that p = m. Therefore, p = m. So coordinates of Q are (p,p). So that would mean that in this coordinate system, Q lies on the line y=x.

But in our previous analysis, Q was at (p, m), so if p = m, then Q is (p, p). Therefore, in this scenario, the coordinates of Q are (p, p). Now, let's see what other constraints we have.

We also have that MQ is perpendicular to NB. Since NB is the y-axis, MQ is horizontal, which we've already considered. Similarly, PQ is vertical, as before.

Now, let's compute lengths of MQ and PQ.

Coordinates:

M is (0, m) = (0, p) since m = p.

P is (p, 0).

Q is (p, p).

So, length of MQ: distance between M(0, p) and Q(p, p) is sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (p - p)^2] = sqrt[p² + 0] = |p|. Assuming p positive, it's just p.

Length of PQ: distance between P(p, 0) and Q(p, p) is sqrt[(p - p)^2 + (p - 0)^2] = sqrt[0 + p²] = |p|, same as above. So lengths of MQ and PQ are equal, which matches the given condition that Length(MQ) = Length(PQ). Good.

Now, the given equations are:

Length(MQ) = 2Var + 2

Length(PQ) = 4Var - 8

And since Length(MQ) = Length(PQ), so:

2Var + 2 = 4Var - 8 ⇒ 2 = 2Var - 8 ⇒ 2Var = 10 ⇒ Var = 5.

Thus, Length(MQ) = 2*5 + 2 = 12. Therefore, QM = 12. Which corresponds to option C.

But wait, in this coordinate system, QM is equal to p, so p = 12. But why is p equal to Length(MQ)? Because MQ is horizontal from (0,p) to (p,p), so length is p units. Therefore, p = 12. So the answer is 12, which is option C.

However, let me confirm whether all the other constraints are satisfied. For instance, the RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Q)) and RightAngle(Angle(N,P,Q)). 

Looking at angle at M: angle NMQ. Since M is (0,p), N is (0,0), and Q is (p,p). So vectors MN and MQ. MN is from M to N: (0 - 0, 0 - p) = (0, -p). MQ is from M to Q: (p - 0, p - p) = (p, 0). The dot product of MN and MQ is (0)(p) + (-p)(0) = 0. Therefore, they are perpendicular. So angle at M is right angle. Similarly for angle at P: PN and PQ. P is (p,0), N is (0,0), Q is (p,p). Vector PN is from P to N: (-p, 0). PQ is from P to Q: (0, p). Dot product is (-p)(0) + (0)(p) = 0. Perpendicular. So yes, both right angles are satisfied.

Another constraint: Perpendicular(Line(M,Q), Line(N,B)). Line(N,B) is y-axis, and line MQ is horizontal (from (0,p) to (p,p)), which is indeed perpendicular to y-axis. Similarly, Line(P,Q) is vertical (from (p,0) to (p,p)), which is perpendicular to NA (the x-axis). All good.

So everything checks out. Therefore, the length QM is p = 12. So the answer is C.12.

But let me check if there's any possibility that Var is not the variable I thought. For example, maybe Var represents something else. But according to the problem statement, the equations are:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,Q)),Add(Mul(2,Var),2))

and 

Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Q)),Sub(Mul(4,Var),8))

So, since Length(MQ) equals 2Var + 2 and Length(PQ) equals 4Var -8. As established, these are equal, giving Var = 5. Then Length(MQ) is 2*5 + 2 = 12. So answer is C.12.

Yes, seems solid. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
