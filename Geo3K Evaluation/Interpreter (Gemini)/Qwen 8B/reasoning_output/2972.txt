<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given points and lines. There are several points mentioned: S, Y, Z, J, V, U, T. The lines connect them in various ways. Also, there are some congruences and equalities given, like Equilateral triangles, midpoints, centroids, etc. 

Let me start by listing out all the given information:

- Points S, Y, Z form an equilateral triangle (since it's stated that Triangle(S,Y,Z) is equilateral). So SY = YZ = ZS. Also, since Congruent(Line(S,Y), Line(Y,Z)) and Congruent(Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,S)), which makes sense for an equilateral triangle.

- Similarly, Triangle(S,T,U) is also equilateral because Congruent(Line(S,T), Line(T,U)) and Congruent(Line(T,U), Line(U,S)). Therefore, ST = TU = US.

- Then there are more lines connecting these points. For example, Line(Z,V), Line(V,U), Line(Z,U), Line(Y,U), Line(S,V), Line(T,Z). Also, there's a point J such that Length(UJ)=9 and Length(VJ)=3. And ZT=18. We need to find SJ.

Additionally, there are several conditions about midpoints and centroids. It says IsMidpointOf(V, Line(Z,U)), so V is the midpoint of ZU. Also, J is the centroid of both triangles S,Y,Z and S,T,U. Since centroids divide medians into ratios 2:1.

Wait, but how does J relate to these triangles? Let me think.

First, let me sketch mentally the figure. Since S, Y, Z form an equilateral triangle. Let me assume coordinates to make things easier. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me assign coordinates to points. Let me place point S at (0, 0) for simplicity. Since Triangle(S,Y,Z) is equilateral. Let me assume that side length is 'a'. But we know that ZT = 18. Wait, ZT is a line between Z and T. Hmm. Also, there's another triangle S,T,U which is equilateral. So maybe I need to find relations between these points.

Alternatively, since V is the midpoint of ZU, and J lies on the intersection of certain lines. Also, J is the centroid of both triangles S,Y,Z and S,T,U. That might mean that J is the common centroid, implying that the two triangles share some relation?

But first, let's note that J is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z). In an equilateral triangle, the centroid coincides with the center. Similarly for Triangle(S,T,U). However, since J is the centroid of both, then perhaps J lies along the medians of both triangles. 

Also, there are lines intersecting at J. Specifically, IntersectAt(Line(Y,U), Line(S,V), Line(T,Z), J). So J is the intersection point of three lines: YU, SV, and TZ. 

So, J is the intersection of these three lines. Given that J is the centroid of both triangles, perhaps this gives us relations between the coordinates of these points.

Moreover, we have lengths: UJ = 9, VJ = 3. Need to find SJ.

Let me attempt to model this with coordinates. Let me consider placing the points in a coordinate system.

Starting with Triangle(S,Y,Z) as equilateral. Let me set coordinates for S, Y, Z. Let me take S at (0, 0). Let me suppose that Y is at (a, 0). Since it's an equilateral triangle, Z would be at (a/2, (√3/2)a). This way, SY = YZ = ZS = a.

Now, since Triangle(S,T,U) is also equilateral. Let me try to find coordinates for T and U. But how do they relate to the rest of the figure?

We also have points V connected to Z and U, and V is the midpoint of ZU. Also, there's a line from Y to U, and from S to V, and from T to Z, all intersecting at J.

Moreover, J is the centroid of both triangles. Let me recall that the centroid of a triangle is located at the average of its vertices' coordinates. So for Triangle(S,Y,Z), centroid J has coordinates [(Sx + Yx + Zx)/3, (Sy + Yy + Zy)/3]. Similarly for Triangle(S,T,U).

Given that J is the centroid of both triangles, so:

For Triangle(S,Y,Z):

J_x = (Sx + Yx + Zx)/3

J_y = (Sy + Yy + Zy)/3

Similarly for Triangle(S,T,U):

J_x = (Sx + Tx + Ux)/3

J_y = (Sy + Ty + Uy)/3

Therefore, since both expressions equal J's coordinates, we can set up equations.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, assign coordinates to S, Y, Z.

Let me fix S at (0, 0). Let me take Y at (a, 0). Then Z is at (a/2, (√3/2)a). Now, let me denote these as:

S = (0, 0)

Y = (a, 0)

Z = (a/2, (√3/2)a)

Now, Triangle(S,T,U) is equilateral. Let me determine coordinates for T and U. However, their positions are related through other connections. For instance, there's a line from Z to T, and from T to U, and from U to S. Also, there's a line from Z to V, V to U, and V is the midpoint of ZU.

Moreover, there's a line from Y to U, and from S to V, which meet at J.

This seems complex, but maybe we can use the fact that J is the centroid of both triangles.

Let me denote variables for T and U. Let me assume that Triangle(S,T,U) is also equilateral. Let me suppose that point T is somewhere, and U is another point such that ST = TU = US. However, without knowing specific coordinates, this could be challenging.

Alternatively, since V is the midpoint of ZU, and there is a line from S to V. Also, J lies on that line. Moreover, J is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z), so J lies along the median from Y to Z? Wait no, the centroid is the intersection of medians. For Triangle(S,Y,Z), the medians are from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

In our case, the centroid J is the intersection of the medians. But according to the problem, J is the centroid of both triangles. Therefore, J lies on the medians of both triangles.

But how can J lie on multiple medians? For example, J lies on the median from Y to the midpoint of SZ in Triangle(S,Y,Z). Also, J lies on the median from S to the midpoint of YZ in Triangle(S,Y,Z). Similarly for the other triangle.

But also, J lies on Line(Y,U), Line(S,V), and Line(T,Z). So perhaps these lines correspond to the medians of the respective triangles.

Let me check. For Triangle(S,Y,Z), the median from Y goes to the midpoint of SZ. The midpoint of SZ would be ((Sx + Zx)/2, (Sy + Zy)/2). Since S is (0,0) and Z is (a/2, (√3/2)a), midpoint of SZ is ((0 + a/2)/2, (0 + (√3/2)a)/2 ) = (a/4, √3 a /4 ). Wait, but the median from Y would go from Y(a,0) to this midpoint.

However, the problem states that Line(Y,U) passes through J. So perhaps U is positioned such that the median from Y in Triangle(S,Y,Z) is Line(Y,U)? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since J is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z), it should lie on the median from Y to the midpoint of SZ. If Line(Y,U) is that median, then U would be that midpoint? Or not necessarily. Because Line(Y,U) could be a different line passing through J.

This is getting complicated. Maybe using coordinates is the way to go, even though it might take time.

Let me proceed with assigning coordinates as follows:

Set S at (0,0), Y at (a,0), Z at (a/2, (√3/2)a). Then, compute coordinates for other points.

Since V is the midpoint of ZU. Let me denote U as (u_x, u_y). Then, V is midpoint of ZU, so coordinates of V are [(Zx + Ux)/2, (Zy + Uy)/2].

Also, there's a line from S to V. So Line(S,V) connects S(0,0) to V[(Zx + Ux)/2, (Zy + Uy)/2]. This line passes through J.

Also, Line(Y,U) connects Y(a,0) to U(u_x, u_y), passing through J.

And Line(T,Z) connects T(t_x, t_y) to Z(a/2, (√3/2)a), passing through J.

Moreover, Triangle(S,T,U) is equilateral, so ST = TU = US.

But also, there's a line from T to Z. Wait, T is part of Triangle(S,T,U), which is equilateral. So ST = TU = US. Therefore, distance from S to T equals distance from T to U equals distance from U to S.

But since S is at (0,0), U is at (u_x, u_y), T is at (t_x, t_y). So:

ST^2 = (t_x)^2 + (t_y)^2

TU^2 = (u_x - t_x)^2 + (u_y - t_y)^2

US^2 = (u_x)^2 + (u_y)^2

All equal. So:

(t_x)^2 + (t_y)^2 = (u_x - t_x)^2 + (u_y - t_y)^2 = u_x² + u_y².

This seems complex, but perhaps there's symmetry. Alternatively, since Triangle(S,T,U) is equilateral, perhaps we can define U and T in terms of rotations.

Another approach: Let me consider that in Triangle(S,T,U), since it's equilateral, the position of U relative to S and T can be determined via rotation. But I need more info.

Alternatively, since there's a line from T to Z, and V is midpoint of ZU. Also, Line(T,Z) passes through J.

Moreover, J is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z) and Triangle(S,T,U). So, for Triangle(S,Y,Z), centroid J has coordinates [(0 + a + a/2)/3, (0 + 0 + (√3/2)a)/3] = [(3a/2)/3, (√3 a / 2)/3] = (a/2, √3 a /6 )

Similarly, for Triangle(S,T,U), centroid J has coordinates [(0 + t_x + u_x)/3, (0 + t_y + u_y)/3 ].

Since both give the same J, we have:

From Triangle(S,Y,Z): J_x = a/2, J_y = √3 a /6.

Therefore, from Triangle(S,T,U):

(0 + t_x + u_x)/3 = a/2 => t_x + u_x = 3a/2

and

(0 + t_y + u_y)/3 = √3 a /6 => t_y + u_y = √3 a / 2.

So that's one equation.

Now, considering that Triangle(S,T,U) is equilateral. So ST = TU = US.

Compute ST^2 = t_x² + t_y²

TU^2 = (u_x - t_x)^2 + (u_y - t_y)^2

US^2 = u_x² + u_y²

Setting ST^2 = US^2:

t_x² + t_y² = u_x² + u_y² → (t_x² - u_x²) + (t_y² - u_y²) = 0 → (t_x - u_x)(t_x + u_x) + (t_y - u_y)(t_y + u_y) = 0.

But from earlier, t_x + u_x = 3a/2 and t_y + u_y = √3 a / 2.

Thus,

(t_x - u_x)(3a/2) + (t_y - u_y)(√3 a / 2) = 0.

Divide both sides by a/2:

3(t_x - u_x) + √3 (t_y - u_y) = 0.

That's one equation.

Also, since ST^2 = TU^2:

t_x² + t_y² = (u_x - t_x)^2 + (u_y - t_y)^2.

Expanding RHS:

u_x² - 2 t_x u_x + t_x² + u_y² - 2 t_y u_y + t_y².

Subtracting LHS:

[ u_x² + u_y² - 2 t_x u_x - 2 t_y u_y + t_x² + t_y² ] - [ t_x² + t_y² ] = u_x² + u_y² - 2 t_x u_x - 2 t_y u_y = 0.

So:

u_x² + u_y² = 2 t_x u_x + 2 t_y u_y.

But from earlier, we had t_x + u_x = 3a/2 ⇒ t_x = 3a/2 - u_x

Similarly, t_y = √3 a / 2 - u_y.

Plugging these into u_x² + u_y² = 2 t_x u_x + 2 t_y u_y:

Left side: u_x² + u_y²

Right side: 2*(3a/2 - u_x)*u_x + 2*(√3 a / 2 - u_y)*u_y

= 2*(3a/2 u_x - u_x²) + 2*(√3 a / 2 * u_y - u_y²)

= 3a u_x - 2u_x² + √3 a u_y - 2u_y²

Thus:

u_x² + u_y² = 3a u_x + √3 a u_y - 2u_x² - 2u_y²

Bring all terms to left:

u_x² + u_y² - 3a u_x - √3 a u_y + 2u_x² + 2u_y² = 0

Combine like terms:

3u_x² + 3u_y² - 3a u_x - √3 a u_y = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

u_x² + u_y² - a u_x - (√3 a / 3) u_y = 0

Hmm. Not sure if helpful yet. Let me see if there's another equation.

Earlier, we had from ST^2 = TU^2 leading to:

3(t_x - u_x) + √3 (t_y - u_y) = 0.

But t_x = 3a/2 - u_x and t_y = √3 a / 2 - u_y.

So substituting:

3( (3a/2 - u_x) - u_x ) + √3 ( (√3 a / 2 - u_y) - u_y ) = 0

Simplify:

3(3a/2 - 2u_x) + √3 ( √3 a / 2 - 2u_y ) = 0

Calculate term by term:

First term: 3*(3a/2) - 3*2u_x = 9a/2 - 6u_x

Second term: √3*(√3 a / 2) - √3*2u_y = (3a/2) - 2√3 u_y

Adding together:

9a/2 - 6u_x + 3a/2 - 2√3 u_y = 0 → (9a/2 + 3a/2) -6u_x -2√3 u_y = 0 → 12a/2 - ... → 6a -6u_x -2√3 u_y = 0 → Divide by 2:

3a - 3u_x - √3 u_y = 0 → Rearranged:

3u_x + √3 u_y = 3a → Equation (1)

So, we have Equation (1): 3u_x + √3 u_y = 3a.

Also, from before, we had:

u_x² + u_y² - a u_x - (√3 a / 3) u_y = 0 → Equation (2)

Let me write Equation (2) again:

u_x² + u_y² = a u_x + (√3 a / 3) u_y

Perhaps we can express u_x from Equation (1):

From 3u_x = 3a - √3 u_y → u_x = a - (√3 / 3) u_y

So substitute u_x into Equation (2):

[ a - (√3 / 3) u_y ]² + u_y² = a [ a - (√3 / 3) u_y ] + (√3 a / 3) u_y

Let me expand the left side:

First term: [a - (√3 / 3) u_y]^2 = a² - 2*a*(√3 / 3)u_y + ( (√3 / 3)^2 )u_y² = a² - (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (3/9)u_y² = a² - (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (1/3)u_y²

Add u_y²: total left side becomes:

a² - (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (1/3)u_y² + u_y² = a² - (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (4/3)u_y²

Right side: a[a - (√3 / 3) u_y ] + (√3 a / 3) u_y = a² - (√3 a / 3) u_y + (√3 a / 3) u_y = a²

So setting left side equal to right side:

a² - (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (4/3)u_y² = a²

Subtract a² from both sides:

- (2√3 a / 3) u_y + (4/3)u_y² = 0 → Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

-2√3 a u_y + 4u_y² = 0 → Factor:

u_y (-2√3 a + 4u_y) = 0

Thus, either u_y = 0, or -2√3 a + 4u_y = 0 → u_y = (2√3 a)/4 = (√3 a)/2.

Case 1: u_y = 0.

If u_y = 0, then from Equation (1): 3u_x + √3 *0 = 3a → 3u_x = 3a → u_x = a.

So U would be at (a, 0). But wait, Y is already at (a, 0). So U would coincide with Y? But then Line(Y,U) would be undefined or zero-length. Also, in Triangle(S,T,U), if U is at (a,0), then S(0,0), U(a,0), and T must satisfy that ST = TU = US. Let's check. If U is (a,0), then US is distance from (0,0) to (a,0) which is a. Then TU must be a. So T must be such that distance from T to U(a,0) is a, and distance from S(0,0) to T is a. So T lies at intersection of two circles: centered at S(0,0) radius a, and centered at U(a,0) radius a. Their intersections are at (a/2, ±(√3 a)/2). So possible positions for T. But then, what about Line(T,Z)? Z is at (a/2, (√3/2)a). Suppose T is at (a/2, (√3/2)a). But then Z and T would be the same point, which is impossible. Or T is at (a/2, - (√3/2)a). Then Line(T,Z) would be from (a/2, - (√3/2)a) to Z(a/2, (√3/2)a), which is vertical line x=a/2. Then V is midpoint of ZU. U is (a,0), Z is (a/2, (√3/2)a). Midpoint V would be [(a + a/2)/2, (0 + (√3/2)a)/2 ] = (3a/4, √3 a /4 ). Then Line(S,V) is from (0,0) to (3a/4, √3 a /4 ), parametrically. Also, Line(Y,U) is from Y(a,0) to U(a,0), which is a single point. So J would be on that line, but since Line(Y,U) is just a point, which conflicts with previous statements. Hence, Case 1 leads to inconsistency. Therefore, reject u_y = 0.

Case 2: u_y = (√3 a)/2.

Then from Equation (1):

3u_x + √3 * (√3 a / 2 ) = 3a → 3u_x + (3a)/2 = 3a → 3u_x = 3a - 3a/2 = 3a/2 → u_x = (3a/2)/3 = a/2.

Thus, U is at (a/2, (√3 a)/2 ). Wait, but that is the same as point Z! Because Z was at (a/2, (√3/2)a). So U coincides with Z? Which would make Line(Z,U) undefined or zero-length. But that contradicts the existence of V being the midpoint of ZU. Thus, this case also leads to contradiction unless U=Z, which isn't allowed. Hence, something wrong here. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine. When solving for u_y, we got u_y = 0 or u_y = √3 a / 2. Both lead to contradictions. What did I do wrong?

Let me check my steps again. Starting from Equation (1): 3u_x + √3 u_y = 3a.

Equation (2): after substitution, led to u_y(-2√3 a + 4u_y)=0. So solutions u_y=0 or u_y=(2√3 a)/4=√3 a /2. 

But when u_y=√3 a /2, then u_x = ?

From Equation (1): 3u_x = 3a - √3 u_y = 3a - √3*(√3 a /2 ) = 3a - (3a)/2 = 3a/2 → u_x = a/2. Thus, U is (a/2, √3 a /2 ), which is same as Z. So U=Z. But then, Line(Z,U) is undefined, and V is midpoint of ZU, which would be Z itself. So V=Z. But then Line(Z,V) would be same as Line(Z,Z), which is invalid. Also, there's a line from S to V, which would be from S(0,0) to Z(a/2, √3 a /2 ). But then Line(S,V) is same as Line(S,Z). But in the original problem statement, there's a line S,T,U forming an equilateral triangle. If U=Z, then S,T,Z would be the triangle. But then T would need to be such that Triangle(S,T,Z) is equilateral. But since Z is already defined, this may not fit with other conditions. 

Alternatively, perhaps my assumption of coordinates is flawed. Let me reconsider the coordinate setup.

Maybe I made a wrong assumption by fixing S at (0,0), Y at (a,0), and Z accordingly. Perhaps I need to adjust the coordinate system. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative idea: Since both triangles S,Y,Z and S,T,U are equilateral, and J is their centroid. Also, V is the midpoint of ZU. Also, J lies on the intersection of Line(Y,U), Line(S,V), and Line(T,Z). Also, given UJ=9, VJ=3, and ZT=18. Need to find SJ.

Let me consider vectors or coordinate-free geometry. Alternatively, think about the properties of centroids and midpoints.

Since J is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z), then it divides the medians in ratio 2:1. Similarly for Triangle(S,T,U).

Let me focus on Triangle(S,Y,Z). Its centroid J is located 2/3 along the median from Y to midpoint of SZ. Similarly, for Triangle(S,T,U), centroid J is located 2/3 along the median from T to midpoint of SU.

But since J is also on Line(Y,U) and Line(S,V), maybe we can use vector relationships.

Let me denote vectors for clarity. Let me consider origin at S, so S is at vector 0.

Let me denote vectors for Y, Z, T, U, V, J.

Given that Triangle(S,Y,Z) is equilateral, so |SY| = |YZ| = |ZS|. Similarly for Triangle(S,T,U).

But since I'm using vectors, maybe I can use properties of centroids.

The centroid J of Triangle(S,Y,Z) is (S + Y + Z)/3. Since S is origin, J = (Y + Z)/3.

Similarly, J is centroid of Triangle(S,T,U), so J = (S + T + U)/3. Since S is origin, J = (T + U)/3.

Therefore, combining both expressions:

(Y + Z)/3 = (T + U)/3 → Y + Z = T + U → T = Y + Z - U.

Interesting relationship. Also, since V is midpoint of ZU, then V = (Z + U)/2.

Also, Line(S,V) goes from S (origin) to V. Parametrize this line as t*V, where t ∈ R.

Line(Y,U) goes from Y to U. Parametrize as Y + s(U - Y), s ∈ R.

Intersection J lies on both lines, so there exist parameters t and s such that:

t*V = Y + s(U - Y).

Also, Line(T,Z) goes from T to Z. Since T = Y + Z - U, as per above. So Line(T,Z) is parametrized as T + k(Z - T) = Y + Z - U + k(Z - Y - Z + U) = Y + Z - U + k(U - Y).

But J lies on this line as well. So there exists parameter k such that J = Y + Z - U + k(U - Y).

But J is also equal to (Y + Z)/3. So:

(Y + Z)/3 = Y + Z - U + k(U - Y).

Rearranging:

U = Y + Z - (Y + Z)/3 - k(U - Y) = (2(Y + Z))/3 - k(U - Y)

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of going further algebraically, use the known distances.

We also know that UJ = 9, VJ = 3, and ZT = 18. Need to find SJ.

Let me recall that J = (Y + Z)/3 from the first centroid.

Also, J = (T + U)/3.

So from T = Y + Z - U.

Let me compute Vector TJ: T - J = (Y + Z - U) - (T + U)/3. Wait, since J = (T + U)/3, then T - J = T - (T + U)/3 = (2T - U)/3.

Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, since V is midpoint of ZU, then V = (Z + U)/2.

Vector JV = V - J = (Z + U)/2 - (Y + Z)/3 = (3(Z + U) - 2(Y + Z))/6 = (Z + 3U - 2Y)/6.

But we know that |JV| = 3. Similarly, |UJ| = 9.

Also, since J is (Y + Z)/3, then vector UJ = U - J = U - (Y + Z)/3.

So |UJ|^2 = |U - (Y + Z)/3|^2 = 9² = 81.

Similarly, |JV|^2 = |V - J|^2 = 3² = 9.

Also, ZT = 18. Since ZT is the distance between Z and T. T = Y + Z - U, so ZT = |Z - T| = |Z - (Y + Z - U)| = |U - Y|.

Thus, |U - Y| = 18.

So |U - Y| = 18.

Let me summarize:

1. |U - Y| = 18.

2. |U - (Y + Z)/3| = 9.

3. |(Z + U)/2 - (Y + Z)/3| = 3.

Let me work with these equations.

First, equation 3:

|(Z + U)/2 - (Y + Z)/3| = |(3(Z + U) - 2(Y + Z))/6| = |(Z + 3U - 2Y)/6| = 3.

Multiply both sides by 6:

|Z + 3U - 2Y| = 18.

So:

Z + 3U - 2Y = ±18 (but magnitude is 18).

Let me denote this as equation (A): Z + 3U - 2Y = ±18.

Also, equation 1: |U - Y| = 18 → U - Y = ±18 direction.

But this is getting abstract. Maybe express everything in terms of vectors.

Let me assume that all points are vectors in plane. Let me consider the vectors:

Let me denote vector Y as y, Z as z, U as u, etc.

From earlier, we have:

1. |u - y| = 18.

2. |u - (y + z)/3| = 9.

3. |z + 3u - 2y| = 18.

Let me expand equation 3:

z + 3u - 2y = 18k, where k is a scalar representing the direction. But since it's vector magnitude, it's hard to handle directly. Alternatively, square both sides:

|z + 3u - 2y|² = 324.

Expand this:

(z + 3u - 2y) · (z + 3u - 2y) = 324.

Let me expand:

z·z + 3u·z + 3u·z - 2y·z - 2y·z - 6y·u + ... Wait, better to do properly:

= z·z + 9u·u + 4y·y + 6u·z - 4y·z - 6y·u.

Wait, let me actually perform the expansion step by step.

Let me write it as (z - 2y) + 3u. So squared:

|z - 2y + 3u|² = |z - 2y|² + 9|u|² + 6u · (z - 2y).

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, since we have other equations.

From equation 2: |u - (y+z)/3|² = 81.

Expand this:

|u|² + |y+z|²/9 - (2/3)u · (y + z) = 81.

But this is getting too involved. Let me think differently.

Let me consider that in Triangle(S,Y,Z), since it is equilateral, |y| = |z| = |y - z|.

Because S is origin, so |SY| = |y - S| = |y|, similarly |SZ| = |z|, and |YZ| = |y - z|.

Since it's equilateral, |y| = |z| = |y - z|.

Let me denote |y| = |z| = a, and |y - z| = a.

So, from |y - z|² = a² → |y|² + |z|² - 2y·z = a² → a² + a² - 2y·z = a² → 2a² - 2y·z = a² → y·z = a²/2.

So y·z = a²/2.

Now, back to equation 1: |u - y| = 18 → |u - y|² = 324.

Equation 2: |u - (y + z)/3|² = 81.

Let me expand equation 2:

|u - (y + z)/3|² = |u|² + |y + z|²/9 - (2/3)u·(y + z) = 81.

But |y + z|² = |y|² + |z|² + 2y·z = a² + a² + 2*(a²/2) = 2a² + a² = 3a².

So equation 2 becomes:

|u|² + (3a²)/9 - (2/3)u·(y + z) = 81 → |u|² + a²/3 - (2/3)u·(y + z) = 81.

Equation 1: |u - y|² = |u|² + |y|² - 2u·y = 324 → |u|² + a² - 2u·y = 324.

Now, let me consider equation 3: |z + 3u - 2y|² = 324.

Expand this:

(z + 3u - 2y) · (z + 3u - 2y) = |z|² + 9|u|² + 4|y|² + 6u·z - 4y·z - 6y·u.

Wait, expanding properly:

= z·z + 3u·z + 3u·z - 2y·z - 2y·z - 6y·u + 9u·u - 6u·y - ... No, better to do systematically:

(z + 3u - 2y) · (z + 3u - 2y) = z·z + 3u·z - 2y·z + 3u·z + 9u·u - 6u·y - 2y·z - 6y·u + 4y·y.

Wait, this is error-prone. Let me use formula (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Here, a=z, b=3u, c=-2y.

So:

= z² + 9u² + 4y² + 2*z*3u + 2*z*(-2y) + 2*3u*(-2y)

= |z|² + 9|u|² + 4|y|² + 6u·z - 4y·z - 12u·y.

Which simplifies to:

a² + 9|u|² + 4a² + 6u·z - 4y·z - 12u·y = 5a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 4y·z - 12u·y.

But since y·z = a²/2, as established earlier.

So substitute:

5a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 4*(a²/2) - 12u·y = 5a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 2a² - 12u·y = 3a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 12u·y.

But this still has terms involving u·z and u·y. Let me see if I can relate them using other equations.

Let me look back at equation 1 and 2. From equation 1: |u|² + a² - 2u·y = 324 → |u|² = 324 - a² + 2u·y.

From equation 2: |u|² + a²/3 - (2/3)u·(y + z) = 81 → Substitute |u|² from above:

(324 - a² + 2u·y) + a²/3 - (2/3)(u·y + u·z) = 81.

Simplify:

324 - a² + 2u·y + a²/3 - (2/3)u·y - (2/3)u·z = 81.

Combine like terms:

324 - (2a²/3) + (2u·y - 2u·y/3) - (2/3)u·z = 81.

Which is:

324 - (2a²/3) + (4u·y/3) - (2/3)u·z = 81.

Multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators:

972 - 2a² + 4u·y - 2u·z = 243.

Rearrange:

-2a² + 4u·y - 2u·z = 243 - 972 = -729 → 

Divide both sides by -2:

a² - 2u·y + u·z = 729/2 = 364.5.

Hmm, not sure if helpful. Let me note that.

Now, returning to the expansion of equation 3:

3a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 12u·y = 324.

But from equation 1, |u|² = 324 - a² + 2u·y. Substituting into this:

3a² + 9*(324 - a² + 2u·y) + 6u·z - 12u·y = 324.

Expand:

3a² + 9*324 - 9a² + 18u·y + 6u·z - 12u·y = 324.

Simplify:

(3a² - 9a²) + 9*324 + (18u·y - 12u·y) + 6u·z = 324.

→ -6a² + 2916 + 6u·y + 6u·z = 324.

Divide both sides by 6:

- a² + 486 + u·y + u·z = 54.

Rearrange:

u·y + u·z = 54 + a² - 486 = a² - 432.

So, u·y + u·z = a² - 432.

Now, from earlier, we had:

From the equation derived from equation 2 and 1: a² - 2u·y + u·z = 364.5.

Let me write down:

Equation (i): a² - 2u·y + u·z = 364.5.

Equation (ii): u·y + u·z = a² - 432.

Let me subtract equation (ii) from equation (i):

(a² - 2u·y + u·z) - (u·y + u·z) = 364.5 - (a² - 432)

Simplify left side:

a² - 3u·y = 364.5 - a² + 432

→ a² - 3u·y = 796.5 - a²

→ 2a² - 3u·y = 796.5

But I don't know if this helps. Let me think of other approaches.

Alternatively, let me denote x = u·y and y = u·z. Then, from equation (ii): x + y = a² - 432.

From equation (i): a² - 2x + y = 364.5.

So, we have two equations:

1. x + y = a² - 432

2. a² - 2x + y = 364.5

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(a² - 2x + y) - (x + y) = 364.5 - (a² - 432)

→ a² - 3x = 364.5 - a² + 432

→ 2a² - 3x = 796.5

So, 2a² - 3x = 796.5 → x = (2a² - 796.5)/3.

But also, from equation 1: x = a² - 432 - y.

But I don't know y. Let me think if there's another relation involving x and y.

Recall that earlier, we had y·z = a²/2.

Also, since u·z = y and u·y = x.

Wait, no. Earlier, I used x = u·y and y = u·z. But what about other dot products?

Wait, we also have from equation 3's expansion, which led to u·y + u·z = a² - 432.

But we also have from earlier, in the expansion of equation 3, which gave us u·y + u·z = a² - 432.

But what else? Let me think.

We also have from equation 1: |u - y|² = 324 → |u|² + a² - 2u·y = 324 → |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x.

But |u|² is also part of other equations.

Let me try to find |u|².

But I need more relations. This seems too tangled. Maybe I need to find a value for a.

Let me recall that ZT = 18, which we said is |U - Y| = 18. So |u - y| = 18, which is equation 1.

Also, from equation 2: |u - (y + z)/3| = 9.

Let me think of this as a geometric condition. The point u is such that its distance from y is 18, and its distance from the point (y + z)/3 is 9. So, it lies on the intersection of two circles: one centered at y with radius 18, and another centered at (y + z)/3 with radius 9.

But since (y + z)/3 is the centroid of Triangle(S,Y,Z), which is J. So, the point u lies on two circles: one around Y with radius 18, and one around J with radius 9.

Also, from equation 3, we had |z + 3u - 2y| = 18. Let me rewrite this as |3u + z - 2y| = 18. Let me rearrange:

3u = 2y - z + v, where |v| = 18. But this might not help.

Alternatively, since z + 3u - 2y = 18k (vectorially), but I don't know.

Alternatively, since z + 3u - 2y = 18w, where w is a unit vector. Not helpful.

Let me try to use specific values. Assume that a is the side length of the equilateral triangle S,Y,Z. Let me try to find a.

Let me consider that in Triangle(S,Y,Z), the distance between Y and Z is a, since it's equilateral. Also, from earlier, we have y·z = a²/2.

Let me try to find the value of a.

Let me consider the point u. It satisfies |u - y| = 18 and |u - (y + z)/3| = 9. Let me denote G = (y + z)/3, which is the centroid J.

So, the point u lies on the intersection of two circles: circle centered at y with radius 18, and circle centered at G with radius 9.

The distance between centers y and G is |y - G| = |y - (y + z)/3| = |(2y - z)/3|.

Let me calculate this distance:

|2y - z| / 3.

But since y and z are vectors with |y| = |z| = a and y·z = a²/2.

Compute |2y - z|² = 4|y|² + |z|² - 4y·z = 4a² + a² - 4*(a²/2) = 5a² - 2a² = 3a² → |2y - z| = a√3. Thus, |y - G| = (a√3)/3 = a/√3.

So the distance between centers y and G is a/√3.

Now, the two circles have radii 18 and 9, and centers separated by a/√3. For these circles to intersect, the sum of radii must be ≥ distance between centers, and difference ≤ distance.

So 18 - 9 ≤ a/√3 ≤ 18 + 9 → 9 ≤ a/√3 ≤ 27 → multiply by √3: 9√3 ≤ a ≤ 27√3.

But we also have other conditions. Let me think about the location of u. Since u is related to other points, perhaps a can be determined from other constraints.

Also, recall that ZT = 18, which is |u - y| = 18, as established earlier.

But I need more relations to find a.

Let me think about the vector equation from earlier: u·y + u·z = a² - 432.

But u·y = x and u·z = y (from earlier notation). Wait, no, previously I denoted x = u·y and y = u·z. Let me clarify:

Let me redefine: let x = u·y and y = u·z. Then, from above, x + y = a² - 432.

Also, from equation 1: |u - y|² = 324 → |u|² + a² - 2x = 324 → |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x.

Also, from equation 2's expansion, we had:

After substitutions, we arrived at x + y = a² - 432.

But I need more equations to solve for x and y.

Let me think about the expression for |u|². Also, from the equation derived from equation 3, which led to:

- a² + 486 + u·y + u·z = 54 → u·y + u·z = a² - 432, which is the same as above.

But I need another equation involving x and y.

Let me consider the vector z. Since |z| = a, and y·z = a²/2.

Also, from the expression for |u|², which is |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x.

But |u|² is also related to other parts. Let me think about the expression from equation 3's expansion, which led to:

3a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 12u·y = 324.

Wait, earlier I substituted |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x into this, leading to a long expression. Let me revisit that.

From earlier, after substituting |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x into the expanded equation 3, we had:

3a² + 9*(324 - a² + 2x) + 6y - 12x = 324, where y = u·z.

Wait, no, in that step, I had:

3a² + 9|u|² + 6u·z - 12u·y = 324.

Substituting |u|² = 324 - a² + 2x, and letting u·z = y, and u·y = x, we get:

3a² + 9*(324 - a² + 2x) + 6y - 12x = 324.

Expanding:

3a² + 9*324 - 9a² + 18x + 6y - 12x = 324.

Simplify:

(3a² - 9a²) + 9*324 + (18x - 12x) + 6y = 324.

→ -6a² + 2916 + 6x + 6y = 324.

Divide by 6:

- a² + 486 + x + y = 54.

But x + y = a² - 432, so substitute:

- a² + 486 + (a² - 432) = 54 → 54 = 54. Which is an identity, so no new information.

Thus, this approach is not yielding new data. I need another way.

Let me recall that in the beginning, I assumed S is at origin, Y at (a,0), Z at (a/2, (√3/2)a). Let me try to proceed with this coordinate system, despite previous issues.

So S = (0,0), Y = (a,0), Z = (a/2, (√3/2)a).

Now, let me find U such that |U - Y| = 18 and |U - J| = 9, where J is (a/2, √3 a /6).

Let me denote U as (u_x, u_y).

Then, |U - Y| = sqrt((u_x - a)^2 + (u_y - 0)^2) = 18 → (u_x - a)^2 + u_y² = 324.

Also, |U - J| = sqrt((u_x - a/2)^2 + (u_y - √3 a /6)^2) = 9 → (u_x - a/2)^2 + (u_y - √3 a /6)^2 = 81.

Let me expand both equations.

First equation: (u_x - a)^2 + u_y² = 324 → u_x² - 2a u_x + a² + u_y² = 324.

Second equation: (u_x - a/2)^2 + (u_y - √3 a /6)^2 = 81.

Expand second equation:

u_x² - a u_x + a²/4 + u_y² - (√3 a /3) u_y + ( (√3 a /6)^2 ) = 81.

Compute (√3 a /6)^2 = (3a²)/36 = a²/12.

So:

u_x² - a u_x + a²/4 + u_y² - (√3 a /3) u_y + a²/12 = 81.

Combine terms:

u_x² + u_y² - a u_x - (√3 a /3) u_y + a²/4 + a²/12 = 81.

Convert a²/4 to 3a²/12, so total a² terms: 3a²/12 + a²/12 = 4a²/12 = a²/3.

So:

u_x² + u_y² - a u_x - (√3 a /3) u_y + a²/3 = 81.

Now, from first equation: u_x² + u_y² = 324 + 2a u_x - a².

Substitute this into second equation:

(324 + 2a u_x - a²) - a u_x - (√3 a /3) u_y + a²/3 = 81.

Simplify:

324 + 2a u_x - a² - a u_x - (√3 a /3) u_y + a²/3 = 81.

Combine like terms:

324 + a u_x - (2a²/3) - (√3 a /3) u_y = 81.

Rearranged:

a u_x - (√3 a /3) u_y = 81 - 324 + (2a²/3) = -243 + (2a²)/3.

Factor a on left:

a [u_x - (√3 /3) u_y] = -243 + (2a²)/3.

Let me denote this as equation (iii): a [u_x - (√3 /3) u_y] = (2a²)/3 - 243.

Now, let me recall from earlier, in the coordinate system, we had V as midpoint of ZU. Z is (a/2, √3 a /2), U is (u_x, u_y). So V is ((a/2 + u_x)/2, (√3 a /2 + u_y)/2).

Also, Line(S,V) goes from S(0,0) to V, and J is on this line. Since J is (a/2, √3 a /6), let's see if it lies on Line(S,V).

Parametrize Line(S,V): any point on this line can be written as t * V, where t is a scalar.

So, for some t, we have:

t * [(a/2 + u_x)/2, (√3 a /2 + u_y)/2] = (a/2, √3 a /6).

So:

t * [(a/2 + u_x)/2] = a/2 → t = [a/2] / [(a/2 + u_x)/2] = a / (a/2 + u_x).

Similarly, for y-coordinate:

t * [(√3 a /2 + u_y)/2] = √3 a /6 → t = [√3 a /6] / [(√3 a /2 + u_y)/2] = [√3 a /6] * 2 / (√3 a /2 + u_y) = √3 a /3 / (√3 a /2 + u_y).

So, both expressions for t must be equal:

a / (a/2 + u_x) = √3 a /3 / (√3 a /2 + u_y).

Cancel a from both sides:

1 / (a/2 + u_x) = √3 /3 / (√3 a /2 + u_y).

Cross-multiplying:

(√3 a /2 + u_y) = √3 /3 * (a/2 + u_x) * 3/1 ? Wait:

Wait, let me write it as:

(√3 a /2 + u_y) = √3 /3 * (a/2 + u_x) * 3 ? No, let me do it properly.

Original equation:

1 / (a/2 + u_x) = √3 /3 / (√3 a /2 + u_y).

Multiply both sides by (a/2 + u_x) and (√3 a /2 + u_y):

√3 a /2 + u_y = √3 /3 * (a/2 + u_x).

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:

3*(√3 a /2 + u_y) = √3*(a/2 + u_x).

Expand:

(3√3 a)/2 + 3u_y = (√3 a)/2 + √3 u_x.

Rearrange:

(3√3 a)/2 - (√3 a)/2 + 3u_y - √3 u_x = 0 → (2√3 a)/2 + 3u_y - √3 u_x = 0 → √3 a + 3u_y - √3 u_x = 0.

Divide both sides by √3:

a + (3/√3)u_y - u_x = 0 → a + √3 u_y - u_x = 0 → u_x = a + √3 u_y.

So, we have u_x = a + √3 u_y. Let me call this equation (iv).

Now, substitute this into equation (iii):

a [u_x - (√3 /3) u_y] = (2a²)/3 - 243.

Substitute u_x = a + √3 u_y:

a [a + √3 u_y - (√3 /3) u_y] = (2a²)/3 - 243.

Simplify inside the brackets:

a + √3 u_y - (√3 /3) u_y = a + ( (3√3 /3 - √3 /3 ) u_y ) = a + (2√3 /3) u_y.

Thus:

a [a + (2√3 /3) u_y] = (2a²)/3 - 243.

Expand left side:

a² + (2√3 a /3) u_y = (2a²)/3 - 243.

Rearrange:

a² - (2a²)/3 + (2√3 a /3) u_y = -243 → (a²/3) + (2√3 a /3) u_y = -243.

Multiply both sides by 3:

a² + 2√3 a u_y = -729.

But this is problematic because a² and a u_y are real numbers, and their combination equals -729. However, since a is a length (positive), and u_y is a coordinate, this suggests that possibly negative values are allowed. Let me proceed.

So, a² + 2√3 a u_y = -729 → Let me write this as:

2√3 a u_y = -729 - a² → u_y = (-729 - a²)/(2√3 a).

Now, recall from equation (iv): u_x = a + √3 u_y.

Substitute u_y:

u_x = a + √3 * [ (-729 - a²)/(2√3 a) ] = a + [ (-729 - a²) / (2a) ] = [2a² - 729 - a²]/(2a) = (a² - 729)/(2a).

So, u_x = (a² - 729)/(2a).

Now, we have expressions for u_x and u_y in terms of a. Let me recall that U is (u_x, u_y), and we also have the first equation: (u_x - a)^2 + u_y² = 324.

Let me substitute u_x and u_y into this equation.

First, compute u_x - a:

u_x - a = (a² - 729)/(2a) - a = (a² - 729 - 2a²)/(2a) = (-a² - 729)/(2a).

So, (u_x - a)^2 = [ (-a² - 729)/(2a) ]^2 = (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/(4a²).

Next, compute u_y²:

u_y = (-729 - a²)/(2√3 a) → u_y² = (729 + a²)^2 / (4 * 3 a²) = (729 + a²)^2 / (12a²).

So, adding (u_x - a)^2 + u_y²:

[ (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) / (4a²) ] + [ (729 + a²)^2 / (12a²) ] = 324.

Let me combine the fractions:

Common denominator is 12a².

First term: 3(a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) / 12a².

Second term: (729 + a²)^2 / 12a².

Total: [3(a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) + (729 + a²)^2] / 12a² = 324.

Expand numerator:

First, expand 3(a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2):

= 3a^4 + 4374a² + 3*729^2.

Second, expand (729 + a²)^2 = a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2.

Add them together:

3a^4 + 4374a² + 3*729^2 + a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2 =

(3a^4 + a^4) + (4374a² + 1458a²) + (3*729^2 + 729^2) =

4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2.

Thus, numerator is 4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2.

So:

[4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2] / 12a² = 324.

Multiply both sides by 12a²:

4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2 = 3888a².

Subtract 3888a² from both sides:

4a^4 + 5832a² - 3888a² + 4*729^2 = 0 → 4a^4 + 1944a² + 4*729^2 = 0.

Wait, this seems problematic because all terms are positive, and their sum cannot be zero. This suggests an error in calculation. Let me check the steps.

Let me recheck the expansion of the numerator:

Original numerator was 3(a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) + (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) = 4a^4 + 2*1458a² + 4*729^2? Wait, no:

Wait, 3(a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) is 3a^4 + 4374a² + 3*729^2.

Plus (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) is a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2.

Total: 3a^4 + a^4 = 4a^4; 4374a² + 1458a² = 5832a²; 3*729^2 + 729^2 = 4*729^2. Correct.

Thus, numerator is 4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2 = 4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2.

But this equals 12a² * 324 = 3888a².

Thus, 4a^4 + 5832a² + 4*729^2 = 3888a² → 4a^4 + 5832a² - 3888a² + 4*729^2 = 0 → 4a^4 + 1944a² + 4*729^2 = 0.

But this is impossible since all terms are positive. This suggests a mistake in previous steps.

Where could the error be? Let me trace back.

When I substituted u_x and u_y into the first equation, perhaps miscalculations occurred.

Let me recompute (u_x - a)^2 + u_y².

Given u_x = (a² - 729)/(2a), and u_y = (-729 - a²)/(2√3 a).

So, u_x - a = (a² - 729)/(2a) - a = (a² - 729 - 2a²)/2a = (-a² - 729)/2a.

Correct.

So (u_x - a)^2 = (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/4a². Wait, no:

Wait, (-a² -729)^2 = (a² + 729)^2 = a^4 + 2*729 a² + 729^2. So, yes, (u_x - a)^2 = (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/4a².

Then, u_y^2 = [ (-729 - a²)^2 ] / (4 * 3 a²) = (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2) / (12a²).

Thus, total is [ (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/4a² ] + [ (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/12a² ] = [3(a^4 + ...) + (a^4 + ...)] / 12a² = 4(a^4 + ...) / 12a² = (a^4 + ...)/3a².

Wait, this is where the error is. Previously, I incorrectly added 3(...) + (...), but it should be 3(...) + (...) = 4(...). Let me recalculate.

Wait, the first term is (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/4a², and the second term is (a^4 + 1458a² + 729^2)/12a². To add them, convert first to 3/12:

3/12 * (a^4 + ...) + 1/12 * (a^
