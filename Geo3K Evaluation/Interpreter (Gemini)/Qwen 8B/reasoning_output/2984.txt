MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the measure of angle Y in this quadrilateral WXYZ. The problem gives me some relationships between the angles. Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, the quadrilateral has four angles: W, X, Y, Z. The measures of these angles are related through equations. Let me note each equation:

- Measure of Angle X is equal to 'a'.
- Measure of Angle Y is equal to (a - 28).
- Measure of Angle W is equal to half of 'a' plus 8. Wait, HalfOf(1) probably means half of 1? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, looking back at the original problem:

The user wrote: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W)), Add(Mul(HalfOf(1), a), 8)). Hmm. Maybe there was a formatting issue here. Let me parse it again. It says Mul(HalfOf(1), a). So HalfOf(1) would be 0.5? Because HalfOf(1) is 1/2. Then multiplying by 'a', so it's (a * 0.5) + 8. So Measure of Angle W is (a/2) + 8.

Then Measure of Angle Z is Add(a, 2), which is just a + 2.

Also, the sum of all four angles equals 360 degrees. Since it's a quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles should indeed be 360 degrees. So SumOf(Angle W, X, Y, Z) = 360.

So, substituting all expressions in terms of 'a':

Angle W: (a/2) + 8

Angle X: a

Angle Y: a - 28

Angle Z: a + 2

Adding them up:

[(a/2) + 8] + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360

Let me compute this step by step.

First, combine like terms.

Let me write all terms:

(a/2) + 8 + a + a - 28 + a + 2

Combine the a terms:

a/2 + a + a + a = a/2 + 3a = (1/2)a + 3a = (7/2)a ?

Wait, wait. Let me check again:

Original terms:

From Angle W: (a/2) + 8

From Angle X: +a

From Angle Y: + (a - 28)

From Angle Z: + (a + 2)

So combining all terms:

a/2 + 8 + a + a - 28 + a + 2

Now, combine the constants first: 8 - 28 + 2 = (8 + 2) - 28 = 10 - 28 = -18

Then the coefficients for a:

a/2 + a + a + a. Let's convert all to halves:

a/2 + 2a/2 + 2a/2 + 2a/2 = (1 + 2 + 2 + 2)/2 * a = 7/2 a?

Wait:

Wait, original terms:

a/2 comes from Angle W.

Then Angle X: +a = +2a/2

Angle Y: +a = +2a/2

Angle Z: +a = +2a/2

Total: (1/2 + 2/2 + 2/2 + 2/2) a = (1+2+2+2)/2 a = 7/2 a. Yes.

Therefore total expression is (7/2)a - 18 = 360.

So:

(7/2)a - 18 = 360

Add 18 to both sides:

(7/2)a = 360 + 18 = 378

Multiply both sides by 2:

7a = 756

Divide by 7:

a = 756 / 7

Calculating that: 7*100=700, 756-700=56. 56/7=8. So total a=108.

So a is 108 degrees.

But we need to find measure of angle Y, which is (a - 28).

Substituting a=108:

Angle Y = 108 - 28 = 80 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 80. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes mistakes can happen.

First, verifying the sum of angles:

If a=108,

Angle W: 108/2 +8 = 54 +8=62

Angle X: 108

Angle Y: 108-28=80

Angle Z: 108+2=110

Sum: 62 + 108 + 80 + 110 = Let's add:

62 + 108 = 170

80 + 110 = 190

Total sum: 170 + 190 = 360. Correct.

Yes, that adds up to 360. Therefore, angle Y is 80 degrees. So the answer is A.

But wait, let me check if there's any possible mistake in interpreting the original equations.

Original problem said:

MeasureOf(Angle(W)) = Add(Mul(HalfOf(1), a), 8). So HalfOf(1) is 0.5? Or perhaps HalfOf(1) refers to something else? For example, maybe "HalfOf(1)" is supposed to be HalfOf(angle X)? But no, the problem states "Mul(HalfOf(1), a)", so it's HalfOf(1) multiplied by a. So HalfOf(1) is 0.5. Hence, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, could there be a misinterpretation of the notation? Like, maybe "HalfOf(1)" refers to half of the value of 1, which is 0.5. So yes, that seems right.

Another way: If someone thought that "HalfOf(1)" meant half of angle X? But that wouldn't make sense since angle X is denoted as 'a'. But the original code seems to indicate that Mul(HalfOf(1), a) is HalfOf(1) times a. So unless there's a different interpretation, the calculation holds.

Thus, conclusion: angle Y is 80 degrees, so answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle Y$, we begin by translating the given conditions into algebraic expressions based on the relationships provided:

---

### Step 1: Define Variables Based on Given Information

We denote the unknown variable $a$ as the measure of $\angle X$. Using this, we express the other angles as follows:

- $\angle X = a$
- $\angle Y = a - 28$
- $\angle W = \frac{a}{2} + 8$
- $\angle Z = a + 2$

---

### Step 2: Use the Quadrilateral Angle Sum Property

In any **quadrilateral**, the sum of the interior angles is always:

$$
\text{Sum of Angles} = 360^\circ
$$

Using the above expressions, we substitute into this equation:

$$
\left(\frac{a}{2} + 8\right) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation

Group like terms:

- Combine the constant terms:  
  $8 - 28 + 2 = -18$

- Combine the terms involving $a$:  
  $\frac{a}{2} + a + a + a = \frac{a}{2} + 3a = \frac{7a}{2}$

So the full equation becomes:

$$
\frac{7a}{2} - 18 = 360
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $a$

$$
\frac{7a}{2} = 378 \\
7a = 756 \\
a = \frac{756}{7} = 108
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate $\angle Y$

Recall that:

$$
\angle Y = a - 28 = 108 - 28 = 80
$$

---

### Final Verification

Check the total angle sum using the values:

- $\angle W = \frac{108}{2} + 8 = 54 + 8 = 62$
- $\angle X = 108$
- $\angle Y = 80$
- $\angle Z = 108 + 2 = 110$

$$
62 + 108 + 80 + 110 = 360
$$

All checks out.

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
