QUESTION:
For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If C D = 14, S T = 10, and A B = 2 x, find x.

CHOICES:
A. 2
B. 3
C. 10
D. 14

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x given some information about a trapezoid. Let me start by recalling what I know about trapezoids. A trapezoid has two parallel sides called bases, and the other two sides are legs. The midsegment (also called the median) connects the midpoints of the legs and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. 

The problem states that CD is 14 units long, which is one of the bases. Then ST is the midsegment, and it's given as 10 units. Also, AB is given as 2x, which is the other base. Wait, the question says that AB is a base because it mentions IsBaseOf(Line(A,B), Trapezoid(A,B,C,D)). So AB and CD are the two bases. 

Since ST is the midsegment, its length should be the average of the lengths of AB and CD. The formula for the midsegment length is (AB + CD)/2. Let me write that down:

ST = (AB + CD)/2

We know ST is 10, CD is 14, and AB is 2x. Plugging those values into the equation:

10 = (2x + 14)/2

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 2:

20 = 2x + 14

Subtract 14 from both sides:

20 - 14 = 2x  
6 = 2x  
Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

So x equals 3. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 3. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me make sure there aren't any other factors here. The problem also mentions points S and T being midpoints of the legs AC and BD respectively. Since they're midpoints, maybe there's something else? But no, the midsegment theorem already accounts for that. The midsegment is always the average of the two bases regardless of the specific trapezoid. So even if the legs are of different lengths, the midsegment's length depends only on the bases. Therefore, my calculation should hold. 

Let me double-check the arithmetic. 2x +14 over 2 equals 10. Multiply both sides by 2: 2x +14=20. Subtract 14: 2x=6. Divide by 2: x=3. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be B.
