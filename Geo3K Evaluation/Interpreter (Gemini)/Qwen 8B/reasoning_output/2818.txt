====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So, we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, it says that Triangle(A,B,C) is a right triangle, specifically Right(Triangle(A,B,C)). Also, Angle(A,B,C) is a right angle. Wait, hold on. The notation might be important here. In standard terms, the angle at point B would be angle ABC, but the way it's written here is Angle(A,B,C). Typically, the middle letter is the vertex of the angle. So Angle(A,B,C) should be the angle at point B between points A and C. But then they mention that it's a right angle, so Angle(A,C,B) is the right angle. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse this again.

The problem states: RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)). So that's the angle at point C between points A and B. Therefore, the right angle is at point C. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. That makes sense because the right angle is specified as Angle(A,C,B), which is angle at C. 

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 30 degrees. Wait, Angle(A,B,C) would be the angle at point B, since the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at B is 30 degrees. Since the triangle is right-angled at C, the angles must add up to 180 degrees. So angle at C is 90°, angle at B is 30°, so angle at A would be 180 - 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. 

Now, the sides: Line(B,C) has length equal to 10√3. So BC = 10√3. We need to find LengthOf(Line(A,C)), which is AC, denoted as x. 

Also, there's a relation involving tangent. It says TanOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))) equals the ratio of LengthOf(Line(A,C)) over LengthOf(Line(B,C)). Let me write that down:

tan(angle at B) = AC / BC

Since angle at B is 30°, tan(30°) = AC / BC.

We know BC is 10√3. So substituting:

tan(30°) = x / (10√3)

But tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore,

1/√3 = x / (10√3)

Multiply both sides by 10√3:

x = (10√3) * (1/√3) = 10

Wait, that simplifies to 10. Because √3 divided by √3 cancels out. So x = 10. Then looking at the answer choices, option A is 10. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here?

Let me check again. If the right angle is at C, then sides: AB is hypotenuse, BC and AC are legs. The angle at B is 30°, so opposite side is AC, adjacent is BC. Therefore, tan(angle at B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. Which is what I used. So tan(30°)=AC/BC → AC=BC*tan(30°).

Given BC is 10√3, so AC = 10√3 * (1/√3) = 10. So yes, x is 10. So answer A. Hmm. But sometimes problems can trick you. Let me make sure about the angle positions.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at B is 30°, making the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in ratios 1 : √3 : 2. Where the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but here, the right angle is at C. So angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to B is AC. Wait, no. Let's think again.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides:

- Opposite angle A: BC
- Opposite angle B: AC
- Hypotenuse AB

So angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to B is AC. Therefore, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. Which matches our previous calculation. So tan(30) = AC / BC → AC = BC * tan(30) = 10√3 * (1/√3) = 10. So x is 10. Therefore, answer A.

But let me cross-validate using another approach. For example, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30° is the shortest one. Here, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to B is AC. So AC is opposite 30°, meaning it's the shorter leg. The side adjacent to angle B (which is BC) is the longer leg. Wait, no. Wait, angle B is 30°, so adjacent side to angle B is BC (since angle B is at point B, so the sides forming the angle are BC and AB. Wait, perhaps confusion arises here. Maybe better to use trigonometric definitions.

Alternatively, let's assign labels properly. Let me sketch mentally:

Right-angled at C, so triangle with right angle at C. So sides:

- AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse.

Angle at B is 30°, so angle between BC and AB is 30°. Therefore, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC.

Yes, same as before. So tan(30°) = AC / BC → AC = BC * tan(30°).

Given BC = 10√3, so AC = 10√3 * (1/√3) = 10. Hence x = 10. So answer A. So the correct answer should be A. But let me check if there's any possibility I mixed up the angle.

Wait, another thought: If angle at B is 30°, then the hypotenuse is AB. The side opposite to angle B (which is AC) is opposite to 30°, so it's half the hypotenuse. Wait, but that would mean AC = AB / 2. However, in that case, if AC = 10, then AB = 20. Then BC would be sqrt(AB² - AC²) = sqrt(400 - 100) = sqrt(300) = 10√3, which matches the given value of BC. So that checks out. Therefore, AC is indeed 10. Thus, answer A is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(A,C)) $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup described:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are told:

- Triangle $ A, B, C $ is a **right triangle**.
- The right angle is at $ C $, i.e., $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $.
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- Side $ BC = 10\sqrt{3} $

This implies the triangle is a **30–60–90 triangle**, where:

- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle BAC = 60^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $

---

### **Step 2: Use Trigonometry to Relate Sides**

In a right triangle, the **tangent** of an acute angle is defined as:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Here, for $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $, the **opposite** side is $ AC $, and the **adjacent** side is $ BC $. So:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{AC}{BC}
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{x}{10\sqrt{3}}
$$

Recall:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{x}{10\sqrt{3}}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Multiply both sides by $ 10\sqrt{3} $:

$$
x = 10\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 10
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying through trigonometric relationships and confirming consistency with the 30–60–90 triangle properties, we conclude that:

$$
x = 10
$$

---

### Final Answer:  
$\boxed{A}$
