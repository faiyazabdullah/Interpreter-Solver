MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 2. First, I need to parse all the given information and see how the angles relate. Let me start by listing out all the given points and lines. 

We have points A, B, C, D, E. The lines mentioned are AD, AE, BE, BC, DE, EC. So connecting those points. Also, there are several angles defined:

- Angle(D,A,E) which is ∠DAE, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. Similarly, Angle(A,D,E) would be ∠ADE, and Angle(A,E,D) would be ∠AED. Wait, but the order matters here. Let me make sure. 

The first angle given is Angle(1), then Angle(2). Then they specify that MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)) = 47°, MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = 57°, MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)) = 55°, and MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,D)), which is another way of writing ∠AED. And MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(2)). Also, the sum of ∠DAE (which is 57°), ∠ADE (which is 47°), and ∠AED (which is Angle(1)) equals 180°. 

So let me write down these equations:

Given:
∠DAE = 57° (since it's Angle(D,A,E))
∠ADE = 47° (since it's Angle(A,D,E))
∠AED = x (let's call this x, which is Angle(1))
Also, ∠EBC = 55° (Angle(E,B,C))

And we know that in triangle ADE, the sum of angles should be 180°, so:
∠DAE + ∠ADE + ∠AED = 180°
Which gives:
57° + 47° + x = 180°
Adding 57+47 gives 104°, so x = 180 - 104 = 76°. Therefore, ∠AED = 76°, which is Angle(1). But also, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = MeasureOf(Angle(2)), so Angle(2) is also 76°. However, wait, looking at the answer choices, option D is 76. But let me check again because maybe there's something else?

Wait, but hold on. Are there any other constraints? For example, the triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,D,E) and Triangle(B,C,E). So triangle B-C-E. In triangle BCE, we have angle at E, which is ∠BEC, and angle at B is ∠EBC = 55°, as given. Wait, but how does that relate?

Let me think about triangle BCE. If we can find some angles there. But do we have enough info? Let me check. We know that in triangle BCE, angle at B is 55°, but what about the other angles? Maybe we need more information. Wait, but perhaps angle at E? Or angle at C? Hmm. Unless there are some vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Alternatively, since there's line BE connected to point E, and line EC connected to point C. Also, line BC connects B to C. So triangle BCE has sides BE, EC, BC. But unless we know more about the triangle, like side lengths or other angles, maybe we can't directly compute. However, maybe there's a relationship between angles in triangle BCE and others?

But the question is about angle 2, which is equal to angle 1, which we found to be 76°, so angle 2 would be 76°, which is option D. However, let me check again if I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,D)), 180). Which means adding up those three angles equals 180. So ∠DAE + ∠ADE + ∠AED = 180. As above, 57 + 47 + x = 180 → x=76. So angle 1 is 76, and angle 2 equals angle 1, so angle 2 is 76. That would mean answer D. But why is there an option for 76? Let me check if there's something wrong here.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the notation of the angles? For instance, ∠AED is the same as ∠A,E,D, which is angle at E between A and D. So yes, that's correct. So angle 1 is ∠AED, which is 76°, and angle 2 is equal to angle 1, hence 76°. So answer D. But maybe there's another constraint?

Wait, the problem mentions Triangle(B,C,E). So triangle BCE. In triangle BCE, angle at B is 55°, as given. What about the other angles? Let me consider that. Suppose we denote angle at E as y, and angle at C as z. Then, in triangle BCE, 55° + y + z = 180°, so y + z = 125°. But without more info, we can't determine y or z individually. However, maybe there's a connection between angles in triangle BCE and the rest of the diagram?

Looking back at the lines: Line BE, EC, BC. Also, line DE connects to E, and line AE connects to E. Is there a possibility that some angles are related through vertical angles or linear pairs?

For example, angle at E in triangle BCE (∠BEC) might be adjacent to angle AED or something else? Let me visualize the diagram. Points A, D, E connected; B, E, C connected. So E is connected to A, D, B, C. So E is a common point. Let me sketch mentally:

Points A, D, E form triangle ADE. Points B, E, C form triangle BEC. So E is connected to A, D, B, C. So at point E, there are four lines: EA, ED, EB, EC. So angles around point E. The angles at point E would include:

- Between EA and ED: ∠AED (which is 76°)
- Between ED and EC: ?
- Between EC and EB: ?
- Between EB and EA: ?

But perhaps some of these angles are related. For example, if lines ED and EC are connected, forming part of triangle DEC? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe considering straight lines?

Wait, if there's a line DE and EC, then maybe angle between ED and EC is part of triangle DEC. But without knowing more, it's hard to tell. However, since we have triangle BEC, angle at E is ∠BEC. Let me think: ∠BEC is part of the angles around point E. Since at point E, angles around it should add up to 360 degrees if they're around a full circle. But if there are multiple angles meeting at E, their measures would depend on the configuration.

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line? For example, if points A, E, D are connected, forming a straight line? No, because A-D-E is a triangle, so not a straight line. Wait, no. Wait, line AD is connected, and line AE is connected. So A is connected to D and E. So A is connected to two points, D and E. So the angle at A between D and E is ∠DAE = 57°, as given.

Now, going back to triangle BCE: angle at B is 55°, as given. If we can find another angle in triangle BCE, maybe using other parts of the diagram. But how?

Wait, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines? Not stated. Alternatively, maybe triangle ADE and triangle BEC have some relation? Not sure. Wait, but angle at E in triangle BEC (∠BEC) may be related to angle AED (which is 76°). Let me think. If lines BE and EC form triangle BEC, and line ED is connected to E. So, suppose that line ED is connected to E, making angle between ED and EC. If there's a straight line somewhere...

Alternatively, maybe ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles? No, unless lines AD and BC intersect at E, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, points A, D, E are connected, and B, C, E are connected. So E is connected to both D and B. If lines BD or something... Not sure.

Wait, but if you look at the angles around point E: At point E, there are angles involving EA, ED, EB, EC. The angle between EA and ED is ∠AED = 76°, which we already calculated. Then, the angle between ED and EC would be part of triangle DEC, but unless we know something about that triangle. Similarly, the angle between EC and EB is ∠BEC, which is part of triangle BEC. And the angle between EB and EA would be ∠BEA.

If we assume that all the angles around point E add up to 360°, then:

∠AED (76°) + ∠DEC + ∠BEC + ∠BEA = 360°. But without knowing specific relations between these angles, it's hard to proceed. However, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, focusing back on the original problem. The key equation was that the sum of ∠DAE (57°), ∠ADE (47°), and ∠AED (x) equals 180°, leading to x = 76°, which is angle 1. Since angle 1 equals angle 2, then angle 2 is 76°, which is option D. But let me check if there's any conflicting information elsewhere.

Wait, the problem also mentions angle(E,B,C) which is ∠EBC = 55°, which is given. So in triangle BEC, we have angle at B is 55°, but unless we can find another angle, we can't say much. But maybe angle at E is related to angle 1? For example, if there's a straight line or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps triangle ADE and triangle BEC share some properties? Like similar triangles? But without side ratios, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe some exterior angles?

Wait, if we consider triangle ADE, angle at E is 76°, which is ∠AED. Now, if line EC is connected to E, then ∠AED and ∠BEC might be supplementary if lines AD and BC are parallel? But there's no mention of parallel lines. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles? That would require that lines AD and BC cross at E, but since E is connected to A, D, B, C, maybe that's possible. Wait, if AD and BC intersect at E, then ∠AED and ∠BEC would be vertical angles. If that's the case, then ∠BEC would be equal to ∠AED, which is 76°, making ∠BEC = 76°. Then, in triangle BEC, angles are 55° at B, 76° at E, so the remaining angle at C would be 180 - 55 - 76 = 49°. But how does that help us?

However, the problem didn't state that lines AD and BC intersect at E. It just says points A, B, C, D, E with various lines. So unless there's an implicit assumption that AD and BC intersect at E, which isn't explicitly stated. So that might be incorrect. 

Therefore, assuming that AD and BC don't necessarily meet at E, then ∠BEC isn't necessarily equal to ∠AED. Hence, my earlier conclusion that angle 2 is 76° stands. However, let me check the answer choices again. Option D is 76, so that would be the answer. But wait, the answer choices are A. 49, B. 55, C. 57, D. 76. So 76 is an option. 

But let me double-check everything once more. 

Original sum: ∠DAE (57) + ∠ADE (47) + ∠AED (x) = 180. So 57 + 47 = 104. 180 - 104 = 76. So x = 76. Angle 1 is x, which is 76. Angle 2 equals angle 1, so angle 2 is 76. Hence, answer D. 

Is there any reason this might be incorrect? Well, perhaps I misread the angle labels. Let me verify each angle label again. 

Angle(D,A,E) is ∠DAE, which is at point A between D and E. Correct. 

Angle(A,D,E) is ∠ADE, at point D between A and E. 

Angle(A,E,D) is ∠AED, at point E between A and D. So that's correct. 

Then, the sum of these three angles in triangle ADE is indeed 180. So calculation seems correct. 

Another thing to check: the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,D))). Angle(A,E,D) is ∠AED, which is x, so angle 1 = x = 76. Then, angle 2 equals angle 1, so angle 2 is 76. 

Thus, the answer should be D. 76. 

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check if angle 1 is different. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,D))). So angle 1 is equal to ∠AED, which is x = 76. Then, angle 2 equals angle 1. So angle 2 is 76. 

Yes. So answer D. 

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another interpretation. Could angle(A,E,D) be a different angle? For example, sometimes angle notation can be confusing. But according to standard notation, ∠AED is the angle at E between A and D. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, could there be an error in the initial assumption that triangle ADE has angles ∠DAE, ∠ADE, ∠AED? Yes, that's correct. Those are the three angles of the triangle. 

Hence, I think the correct answer is D. 76°.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric relationships and applying basic principles of triangle angle sums and equality of angles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Angles**

From the problem, the following angles are specified:

- $ \angle DAE = 57^\circ $
- $ \angle ADE = 47^\circ $
- $ \angle AED = x $ (this will be denoted as Angle(1))
- $ \angle EBC = 55^\circ $
- $ \angle 1 = \angle AED $ and $ \angle 1 = \angle 2 $

We are also told that the sum of the three angles of triangle $ ADE $ is $ 180^\circ $. Using this fact:

$$
\angle DAE + \angle ADE + \angle AED = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
57^\circ + 47^\circ + x = 180^\circ
$$

$$
x = 180^\circ - 57^\circ - 47^\circ = 76^\circ
$$

Thus, $ \angle AED = 76^\circ $, and since $ \angle 1 = \angle AED $, we have:

$$
\angle 1 = 76^\circ
$$

Finally, since $ \angle 1 = \angle 2 $, we conclude:

$$
\angle 2 = 76^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 2: Verify Consistency with Other Constraints**

There’s also a reference to triangle $ BCE $, where $ \angle EBC = 55^\circ $. While this provides context, it doesn’t affect the computation of $ \angle 2 $, which is determined solely based on triangle $ ADE $ and the given equality $ \angle 1 = \angle 2 $.

No further contradictions arise from the additional information, confirming that our reasoning is consistent.

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the geometric constraints and the triangle angle sum property, we calculate that $ \angle 2 = 76^\circ $.

**Final Answer: D**  
$$
\boxed{D}
