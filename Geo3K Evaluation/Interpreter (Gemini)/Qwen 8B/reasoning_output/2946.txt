MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this kite angle problem. So, we have a kite named FGHIJ? Wait, no, the points are F, G, H, J. Let me make sure I got that right. The kite is FGHJ. Wait, kites have four sides, so maybe it's F, G, H, J connected as a quadrilateral. Let me recall the properties of a kite.

First, a kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are congruent. Also, the angles between the unequal sides are called vertex angles, and they're equal. Wait, actually, in a kite, one pair of opposite angles are equal. Those are the ones between the pairs of congruent sides. Hmm. Also, the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, but maybe that's more advanced than needed here.

Given the problem, there are several constraints:

- It's a kite (F, G, H, J). So, sides FG and GH are congruent? Or maybe FG and FJ? Wait, the problem says Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(F,J), Line(H,J)). Let me check that again.

The constraints say:

- Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)): So FG ≅ GH. Therefore, sides FG and GH are congruent.

Then, Congruent(Line(F,J), Line(H,J)): So FJ ≅ HJ. So sides FJ and HJ are congruent.

So the kite has two pairs of adjacent congruent sides: FG=GH and FJ=HJ. Wait, but in a standard kite, the pairs of congruent sides are adjacent. So for example, in a kite, you have two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. So if FG and GH are congruent, then those are adjacent sides meeting at point G. Then FJ and HJ are congruent, which would be adjacent sides meeting at J. Wait, but in a quadrilateral, each side connects two vertices. So the sides are FG, GH, HJ, and JF. So the pairs of congruent sides would be FG = GH and HJ = JF? But the problem states Congruent(Line(F,J), Line(H,J)), meaning FJ and HJ are congruent. So that would mean sides FJ and HJ are congruent. So the kite has two pairs of adjacent congruent sides: FG = GH and FJ = H/J. Wait, but that might not form a kite unless the arrangement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the order of the points matters. In a kite, the pairs of congruent sides are adjacent. So if we have a kite with vertices labeled in order F, G, H, J, then the sides would be FG, GH, HJ, JF. For it to be a kite, either FG = GH and HJ = JF, or FG = FJ and GH = HJ. But according to the problem, the congruences are FG ≅ GH and FJ ≅ HJ. So that would mean that sides FG and GH are congruent (so adjacent sides at G), and sides FJ and HJ are congruent (adjacent sides at J). That seems like a valid kite structure. So the kite has two pairs of adjacent congruent sides: FG=GH and FJ=HJ.

Now, the angles given are:

- Angle at FGH (which is angle at G between FG and GH) is 128 degrees.

- Angle at HJF (which is angle at J between HJ and JF) is 72 degrees.

Also, it's stated that measure of angle JFG equals measure of angle GHJ. Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,F,G)), MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J))). So angle JFG is the same as angle GHJ. Let me parse that.

Angle JFG is the angle at point F between points J, F, G. Wait, angle J-F-G, so vertex at F, with segments FJ and FG. Similarly, angle GHJ is the angle at point H between points G, H, J. Wait, no. Wait, angle G-H-J is at point H between G, H, J. Wait, the notation is Angle(G,H,J), which is angle at H between G and J. So angle GHJ is at H. But the problem says that measure of angle JFG equals measure of angle GHJ. So angle at F (JFG) equals angle at H (GHJ).

Additionally, the sum of all four angles is 360 degrees. Which makes sense for any quadrilateral.

Our goal is to find m∠GFJ, which is the angle at point F between points G, F, J. Wait, ∠GFJ is the angle at F between G and J. Wait, but angle JFG is the same as ∠GFJ. Because angle JFG is at F, with segments JF and FG. So yes, ∠GFJ is the same as angle JFG. So the question is asking for the measure of ∠GFJ, which is angle at F between G and J. 

But let me confirm the notation. In the problem statement, the angle is written as Angle(F,G,H), which is angle at G between F and H. So similarly, Angle(J,F,G) would be angle at F between J and G. So that's ∠JFG, which is the same as ∠GFJ. So our target is to find the measure of that angle.

Let me note down all given angles:

Given:

- Measure of ∠FGH (at G) is 128°.

- Measure of ∠HJF (at J) is 72°.

Also, measure of ∠JFG (at F) equals measure of ∠GHJ (at H). And the sum of all four angles is 360°.

We need to find measure of ∠JFG (i.e., ∠GFJ).

Let me denote variables for unknown angles.

Let me label the four angles of the kite:

In a kite, typically, the angles between the unequal sides are called the vertex angles. However, since we have specific information, let's proceed step by step.

Let’s denote:

Let’s call ∠FGH = 128°, which is angle at G.

∠HJF = 72°, angle at J.

Also, ∠JFG = ∠GHJ. Let me denote ∠JFG = x. Therefore, ∠GHJ is also x.

Now, since the sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360°, we can write:

Sum of angles = ∠FGH + ∠GHJ + ∠HJF + ∠JFG = 128° + x + 72° + x = 360°

Wait, wait. Wait, the four angles are:

At point F: ∠JFG (x)

At point G: ∠FGH (128°)

At point H: ∠GHJ (x)

At point J: ∠HJF (72°)

So total sum is x + 128 + x + 72 = 360.

Therefore:

2x + 128 + 72 = 360 → 2x + 200 = 360 → 2x = 160 → x = 80°.

So the measure of ∠JFG (which is ∠GFJ) is 80 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices: option B is 80. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me verify again because sometimes in kites, some properties may affect this. Let me double-check.

Another approach: Since it's a kite, we know that the two angles between the congruent sides are equal. Wait, in a kite, the angles between the congruent sides are equal. Wait, in a kite with two pairs of adjacent congruent sides, the angles between the pairs of congruent sides are equal. Wait, so for example, if FG = GH and FJ = HJ, then the angles between FG and GH (which is ∠FGH) and between FJ and HJ (which is ∠HJF) are the ones that are equal?

Wait, but in this case, ∠FGH is given as 128°, and ∠HJF is 72°, which are different. So that suggests that these are the non-equal angles. Wait, but in a kite, only one pair of opposite angles are equal. Wait, so maybe the angles that are between the congruent sides are equal. Wait, let me think again.

In a kite, the two angles that are between the pairs of congruent sides are equal. Wait, suppose the kite is shaped such that sides FG and GH are congruent, and sides FJ and HJ are congruent. Then, the angles between FG and GH (which is ∠FGH) and between FJ and HJ (which is ∠HJF) are the ones that are equal? Wait, but in this case, ∠FGH is 128°, and ∠HJF is 72°, which are not equal. That contradicts. So perhaps my initial assumption about which angles are equal is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the angles that are between the unequal sides are equal. Wait, no. Wait, in a kite, the angles between the congruent sides are called the vertex angles and are equal. Wait, maybe I need to visualize the kite.

Imagine a kite with vertices F, G, H, J arranged such that FG = GH and FJ = HJ. Wait, but how does that shape look? If FG = GH, then points F, G, H form a triangle with FG=GH. Then, HJ = FJ, so from point J, connecting back to H and F. Maybe the kite is symmetric along the diagonal FH?

Wait, perhaps the key is that in a kite, one pair of opposite angles are equal. So if FG = GH and FJ = HJ, then the angles between the unequal sides are the ones that are equal. Wait, maybe ∠F and ∠H are the ones that are equal? Wait, but in this problem, we have ∠FGH (at G) and ∠HJF (at J) given. So perhaps the other angles (∠F and ∠H) are equal?

Wait, earlier, we considered that ∠JFG (at F) equals ∠GHJ (at H). Let me check that again. The problem says that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,F,G)), MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J))). So Angle(J,F,G) is ∠JFG (at F), and Angle(G,H,J) is ∠GHJ (at H). So that tells us that ∠JFG = ∠GHJ. Therefore, in the kite, the angles at F and H are equal. Which makes sense because in a kite, the angles between the unequal sides are equal. Wait, but in this case, if FG = GH and FJ = HJ, then the sides FG and GH are congruent, so the angles opposite them... Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But regardless, based on the given equations, we had the equation:

Sum of angles: 128 + x + 72 + x = 360 ⇒ 2x + 200 = 360 ⇒ x = 80. So that gives x = 80°, which would be the measure of ∠JFG, which is the angle at F, which is what we need. Hence, answer is B.

But let me cross-validate with another method. Suppose we use the fact that in a kite, the sum of the measures of the angles is 360°, and knowing that two of the angles are 128° and 72°, and the other two are equal. Wait, but if the two equal angles are the ones at F and H, then their sum would be 2x, and adding the other two angles (128 and 72) gives 360. Which is exactly the same equation as before. So that leads to 2x = 160 ⇒ x=80. So that confirms the previous calculation.

Thus, the measure of angle GFJ is 80°, so answer B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle GFJ $, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints provided in the problem involving the kite $ FGJH $. The key elements include:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Kite**

From the constraints:
- $ \text{Congruent}(FG, GH) $
- $ \text{Congruent}(FJ, HJ) $

This implies that the kite has **two pairs of adjacent congruent sides**:
- Pair 1: $ FG = GH $
- Pair 2: $ FJ = HJ $

This structure ensures that the kite consists of two distinct triangles formed by its diagonals — specifically, triangles $ \triangle FGH $ and $ \triangle FJH $, both sharing the common vertex at point $ F $.

---

### **Step 2: Assign Known Angles and Use Given Relationships**

The problem provides the following angle measurements:
- $ \angle FGH = 128^\circ $ (at vertex $ G $)
- $ \angle HJF = 72^\circ $ (at vertex $ J $)
- $ \angle JFG = \angle GHJ $ (this is given as part of the constraint)

Let:
- $ \angle JFG = x $ (this is the angle we are asked to compute, i.e., $ \angle GFJ $)
- $ \angle GHJ = x $ (since it's given that these are equal)

These angles correspond to the two non-congruent opposite angles of the kite.

---

### **Step 3: Use the Sum of Interior Angles in a Quadrilateral**

The sum of the internal angles in any quadrilateral is always:

$$
\angle FGH + \angle GHJ + \angle HJF + \angle JFG = 360^\circ
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
128^\circ + x + 72^\circ + x = 360^\circ
$$

Combine terms:

$$
2x + 200^\circ = 360^\circ
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
2x = 160^\circ \\
x = 80^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Since $ x = \angle JFG = \angle GFJ $, the measure of $ \angle GFJ $ is:

$$
\boxed{80}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

**Final Answer: B**
