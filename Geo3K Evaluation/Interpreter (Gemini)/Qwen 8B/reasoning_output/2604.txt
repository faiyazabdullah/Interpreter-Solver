MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a right triangle ABC, right? The problem says it's a right triangle with the right angle at point C because Angle(A,C,B) is a right angle. Wait, the notation might be important here. Let me parse that again. The angle mentioned is Angle(A,C,B). In standard notation, that would mean the angle at point C between points A and B. So vertex at C, with segments AC and BC forming the angle. Therefore, the right angle is at C, making triangle ABC a right-angled triangle with legs AC and BC, and hypotenuse AB. 

Now, the problem gives some equations involving lengths. Let me list them:

- Length of line AC is equal to (x - 3).
- Length of line AB is equal to x.
- Length of line BC is 9.
- Also, there's a Pythagorean theorem relation: Square of AB equals square of AC plus square of BC. Since it's a right triangle, that should hold.

So, since it's a right triangle with right angle at C, the sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, according to Pythagoras:

AB² = AC² + BC²

We can plug in the values given. Let me write down the variables:

Let’s denote:

AC = x - 3  
BC = 9  
AB = x  

Therefore substituting into Pythagoras:

x² = (x - 3)² + 9²

Expanding that equation:

x² = (x² - 6x + 9) + 81  
Simplify the right side:

x² = x² -6x + 9 + 81  
Combine constants:

x² = x² -6x + 90

Now subtract x² from both sides:

0 = -6x + 90  
Then add 6x to both sides:

6x = 90  
Divide both sides by 6:

x = 15

Wait, so x is 15? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with AB² = AC² + BC². Given AB is x, AC is x-3, BC is 9. So plugging in:

x² = (x - 3)^2 + 9^2  
Which expands as:

x² = x² -6x +9 +81  
Yes, then combining terms:

x² = x² -6x +90  
Subtract x² from both sides:

0 = -6x +90  
Adding 6x: 6x=90 → x=15. That seems correct. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 15. So the answer should be B. 

But wait, let me check if there's anything else in the problem that might affect this. For example, are there any other constraints? The problem mentions Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C)). But since the triangle is right-angled at C, lines AC and BC are perpendicular, which is already accounted for by the right angle. So that condition is redundant but consistent. 

Also, the problem states that AB is the hypotenuse, which matches our assumption. So everything checks out. 

Thus, solving the equation leads us to x=15, which corresponds to answer choice B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described. We are told that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a **right angle at point $ C $**, meaning the legs of the triangle are $ AC $ and $ BC $, while the hypotenuse is $ AB $. This aligns with the fact that $ \angle ACB $ is a right angle.

### Step 1: Assign Variables Based on Given Constraints

From the problem, we know the following relationships among the sides of the triangle:

- $ \text{Length}(AC) = x - 3 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 9 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = x $

Additionally, the **Pythagorean Theorem** applies since $ \triangle ABC $ is a right triangle:

$$
\text{(Hypotenuse)}^2 = \text{(Leg 1)}^2 + \text{(Leg 2)}^2
$$

Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$

Substitute known expressions:

$$
x^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 9^2
$$

---

### Step 2: Expand and Simplify the Equation

Expand the squared term:

$$
x^2 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 81
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$
x^2 = x^2 - 6x + 90
$$

Now subtract $ x^2 $ from both sides:

$$
0 = -6x + 90
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
6x = 90 \Rightarrow x = 15
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify Consistency with All Given Information

The solution satisfies all conditions:
- The length of $ AB = x = 15 $
- The length of $ AC = x - 3 = 12 $
- The length of $ BC = 9 $
- Check the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \Rightarrow 15^2 = 12^2 + 9^2 \Rightarrow 225 = 144 + 81 = 225
$$

All constraints are satisfied.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
