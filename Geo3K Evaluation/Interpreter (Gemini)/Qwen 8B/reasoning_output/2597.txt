MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an equilateral pentagon PQRS T inscribed in a circle U. We need to find the measure of arc QR, denoted as m∠QR. The answer choices are A. 36, B. 72, C. 120, D. 144.

First, let me recall some concepts. An equilateral pentagon means all sides are equal in length. Since it's inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic pentagon. But wait, not all cyclic pentagons are regular. However, here they mention it's both equilateral and inscribed in a circle. Hmm, but for a polygon to be both equilateral and cyclic, does that make it regular? Wait, no. For example, a rectangle is cyclic and equilateral (all sides equal) but it's not regular unless it's a square. Wait, rectangles aren't equilateral unless they're squares. Wait, maybe I'm confusing terms here.

Wait, actually, a regular pentagon has all sides equal and all angles equal, and it's cyclic. But if a pentagon is only equilateral and cyclic, does that mean it's regular? Or can there be variations?

But hold on, in this case, there's more information. The problem says that the pentagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal. Also, each side is part of the pentagon, and all vertices lie on the circle. Additionally, the arcs corresponding to each side are equal. Let me check the given constraints again.

Looking back at the problem statement:

They have Arc(Q,R), Arc(R,S), etc., and the measures of these arcs are equal. Specifically, the measure of arc QR equals arc RS equals arc ST equals arc TP equals arc PQ. So all arcs between consecutive points are equal. Therefore, since the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, and all arcs between consecutive vertices are equal, then the arcs are congruent. 

So, if all arcs are equal, then each arc would correspond to the same central angle. Since the total circumference corresponds to 360 degrees, the measure of each arc would be 360 divided by the number of arcs. Since there are five arcs (from the pentagon), each arc would be 360/5 = 72 degrees. Therefore, the measure of arc QR would be 72 degrees. That would point towards answer B. But wait, let me verify this carefully.

Wait, but hold on. If all arcs are equal, then yes, each arc would be 360/5=72°, which would make the measure of arc QR equal to 72°, hence answer B. But why is the pentagon called equilateral? Because in a cyclic polygon, if all sides are equal, does that imply that all arcs are equal? Wait, in general, for a cyclic polygon, the length of the chord (which is the side) depends on the measure of its subtended arc. So, if all chords (sides) are equal, then their subtended arcs must be equal. Hence, in this case, since the pentagon is equilateral and cyclic, all arcs must be equal. Therefore, each arc is 72°, making arc QR equal to 72°, so answer B.

But wait, another thought: Is there a possibility that the arcs could be different but still result in equal chord lengths? For instance, in a circle, two different arcs (one major and one minor) can subtend the same chord length. However, in a pentagon, when you inscribe it, each arc between two consecutive points would be less than 180°, because otherwise, the chord would be longer. But since it's a convex pentagon, all arcs should be less than 180°, right? Therefore, each arc must be equal, leading to each being 72°, so answer B.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose the pentagon is equilateral and cyclic. Then, each side is a chord of the circle. Since all sides are equal, all chords are equal. In a circle, equal chords subtend equal arcs. Therefore, all arcs between consecutive vertices must be equal. Therefore, each arc is 360/5 = 72°, so arc QR is 72°, answer B. 

Therefore, the answer should be B. Let me check if there's any catch here. Maybe the pentagon isn't regular, but just equilateral and cyclic. But even so, the arcs must be equal. So, the measure of arc QR is 72°, which is option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The pentagon $PQRST$ is inscribed in a circle $\odot U$, meaning all its vertices lie on the circle. It is also **equilateral**, so all its sides are of equal length. Furthermore, the arcs subtended by its sides are explicitly stated to be equal in measure:  
$$
\text{Measure}(\widehat{QR}) = \text{Measure}(\widehat{RS}) = \text{Measure}(\widehat{ST}) = \text{Measure}(\widehat{TP}) = \text{Measure}(\widehat{PQ})
$$

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Key Concept**:  
   In a **cyclic polygon** (a polygon inscribed in a circle), the **length of a chord** (side of the polygon) is determined entirely by the **measure of the arc** it subtends. Equal chords subtend **equal arcs**.  

   Here, since the pentagon is **equilateral**, all sides are equal, implying all **arcs subtended by those sides are equal**.

2. **Total Circle Angle**:  
   A full circle contains $360^\circ$. Since the pentagon has **five arcs** (between its five vertices), and all arcs are equal, each arc must subtend:  
   $$
   \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
   $$

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Each arc, including $\widehat{QR}$, measures $72^\circ$. Thus, the measure of arc $\widehat{QR}$ is directly computed as:
   $$
   m\widehat{QR} = 72^\circ
   $$
