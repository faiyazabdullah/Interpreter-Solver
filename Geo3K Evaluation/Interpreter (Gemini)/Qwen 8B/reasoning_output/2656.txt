<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of this parallelogram based on the given constraints. Hmm, first, I remember that the area of a parallelogram can be found using the base times height. But there's also another formula involving the lengths of two adjacent sides and the sine of the angle between them. Wait, right! The formula is Area = ab sin θ, where a and b are the lengths of the sides and θ is the angle between them. 

But wait, let me check the given information again. The problem says it's a parallelogram ABCD. So opposite sides are equal and parallel. They mention that line AD is equal in length to BC, which makes sense because in a parallelogram opposite sides are equal. Also, they say that the length of AD is 13 units, so BC is also 13. Then, the length of AC (which would be a diagonal) is 10 units. Wait, but how does that help?

Also, there's a point E connected via line DE, and some perpendicularity conditions. Let me parse through all the constraints again:

- Parallelogram ABCD, so AB || CD, AD || BC, and AB equals CD, AD equals BC. 
- Points A, B, C, D are vertices of the parallelogram. Point E is somewhere else.
- Line AD has length 13, so AD = 13. Therefore, BC is also 13 since opposite sides are equal.
- The length of AC is 10. AC is a diagonal connecting A to C. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but their lengths aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. However, here we have one diagonal as 10, and the other diagonal isn't mentioned yet. Maybe we need to use the law of cosines or something related to the diagonals?

Wait, but maybe I should think about coordinates. Assigning coordinates might make things clearer. Let me try that approach.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is a side of the parallelogram and its length is 13, but direction? Well, without loss of generality, I can assign coordinates such that vector AD is along the x-axis for simplicity. Wait, but then line AD is horizontal. However, there's also line BE and some perpendicularity condition. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model vectors. Let me denote vectors for sides AB and AD. Let’s say vector AB is vector u and vector AD is vector v. Then, the area of the parallelogram is |u × v|, which is the magnitude of the cross product. Which is also equal to |AB||AD|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. So if I can find the angle between AB and AD, or find the lengths of AB and AD and the sine of the angle between them, then I can compute the area.

But given that AC is a diagonal, which connects A to C. In terms of vectors, point C is B + AD, so vector AC = AB + AD. Therefore, the length of AC squared is |AB + AD|² = |AB|² + |AD|² + 2 AB · AD. Since AC is given as 10, so:

|AC|² = |AB|² + |AD|² + 2 AB · AD = 100

We know |AD| is 13, so |AD|² = 169. Let me denote |AB| as x. Then, AB · AD is |AB||AD|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. So substituting into the equation:

x² + 169 + 2 * x * 13 * cos(theta) = 100

Hmm, but this seems like an equation with two variables, x and theta. Not sure yet. But maybe there's more info from the other constraints.

Looking back, there's a triangle DEB, with a right angle at E. Also, line DE is perpendicular to BC. Let me think about that. Since BC is a side of the parallelogram, which is equal to AD and same direction as AD. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, BC is equal and parallel to AD. So if AD is a vector, then BC is the same vector. So line BC is parallel to AD. But line DE is perpendicular to BC, hence DE is perpendicular to AD. Therefore, DE is perpendicular to AD. So DE is perpendicular to AD. That gives us some information about triangle DEB.

Moreover, there's a right angle at E in triangle DEB, meaning that angle at E is 90 degrees. So triangle DEB is a right triangle with right angle at E. Also, angle at B in triangle DEB is part of the parallelogram. Wait, the angle at B is given as 45 degrees? Wait, the problem states:

"Angle(C,B,E)" and "MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E))=45". So angle at B between points C, B, E is 45 degrees. So angle CBE is 45 degrees. And triangle DEB is right-angled at E. So in triangle DEB, angle at E is 90 degrees. Let me try to visualize this.

So point E is connected to D and B. DE is perpendicular to BC (and thus to AD). Since BC is parallel to AD, DE is perpendicular to BC. So DE is vertical if BC is horizontal. Let me consider coordinates again.

Let me set up coordinate system with A at (0,0). Let me assume AD is along the x-axis. So point D is at (13, 0), since AD is length 13. Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point B can be at (a, b), and point C would be at (a+13, b). Because vector AB is (a, b), and vector DC is same as AB. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, vector AB equals DC, and vector AD equals BC.

Wait, coordinates:

If A is (0,0), D is (13,0). Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB plus vector AD equals vector AC. So coordinates:

Let me define coordinates properly. Let me suppose:

A = (0, 0)

D = (13, 0)

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, then vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC.

Let me denote point B as (p, q). Then, since AB is from A(0,0) to B(p,q), so vector AB is (p, q). Then, since AD is from A(0,0) to D(13,0), vector AD is (13, 0).

Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point C can be found as B + AD. So coordinates of C = B + AD = (p + 13, q + 0) = (p +13, q). Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the coordinates of C can be found as D + AB. From D(13,0) adding vector AB (p, q) gives (13+p, 0+q) = same as above.

Now, the diagonal AC connects A(0,0) to C(p+13, q). The length of AC is given as 10. So distance between A and C is sqrt[(p+13)^2 + (q)^2] = 10. Therefore,

(p +13)^2 + q^2 = 100. Equation (1)

Additionally, the length of AB is sqrt(p² + q²). Let's call this length AB = sqrt(p² + q²). Similarly, AD is 13, as given.

Now, considering the other constraints. There's a point E such that line DE is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is the same as AD, which is horizontal (from earlier assumption). Wait, BC goes from B(p, q) to C(p +13, q). So vector BC is (13, 0), same as AD. So BC is horizontal. Hence, line BC is horizontal. Therefore, line DE is perpendicular to BC, which is horizontal, so DE must be vertical. So line DE is vertical. Therefore, DE is a vertical line.

So point E lies somewhere on a vertical line passing through D. Wait, DE is a vertical line. Since D is at (13, 0), then DE is vertical, so E has the same x-coordinate as D, which is 13. So E is (13, y) for some y.

Now, triangle DEB is right-angled at E. So triangle with points D(13,0), E(13,y), B(p,q). Right angle at E. Therefore, vectors ED and EB are perpendicular. Vector ED is from E to D: (13 - 13, 0 - y) = (0, -y). Vector EB is from E to B: (p -13, q - y). Their dot product must be zero:

ED • EB = (0)(p -13) + (-y)(q - y) = 0 - y(q - y) = -yq + y² = 0 → y(-q + y) = 0. Therefore, either y = 0 or y = q.

But y cannot be 0, because otherwise E would coincide with D, making DE length zero, which is not possible. So y = q. Therefore, point E is (13, q). 

Therefore, coordinates of E are (13, q). Now, triangle DEB is right-angled at E, so DE and EB are perpendicular. We already used that to get E's y-coordinate as q. 

Also, angle CBE is 45 degrees. Let me think about that. Angle at B between points C, B, E. So angle between BC and BE. Let's find vectors for BC and BE. 

Vector BC is from B to C: (13, 0). Vector BE is from B to E: (13 - p, q - q) = (13 - p, 0). Wait, since E is (13, q) and B is (p, q), so BE vector is (13 - p, 0). So vector BC is (13, 0), vector BE is (13 - p, 0). Wait, but these are both horizontal vectors. So the angle between them is zero? That can’t be. Wait, that suggests that angle CBE is zero, but according to the problem it's 45 degrees. This contradiction implies I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. If vector BC is from B to C, which is (13, 0), as before. Vector BE is from B to E, which is (13 - p, 0). So those are colinear? So angle between BC and BE is zero? That contradicts the given angle measure of 45 degrees. So my previous reasoning must be wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, let's re-examine the coordinates. Earlier, I assumed that BC is horizontal, which is true since AD is horizontal (since I placed D at (13,0) and AD is horizontal). But BC is equal and parallel to AD, so yes, BC is horizontal. However, point E is (13, q). Then BE is from B(p,q) to E(13,q), which is horizontal. So vector BE is (13 - p, 0). Vector BC is from B(p,q) to C(p +13, q), which is (13, 0). So both vectors BE and BC are horizontal. Thus, angle between them is zero degrees. But the problem states that angle CBE is 45 degrees. Contradiction. So my assumption that DE is vertical may be incorrect? Or perhaps my coordinate setup is flawed?

Wait, but DE is supposed to be perpendicular to BC. Since BC is horizontal, DE must be vertical. But then E ends up creating a situation where angle CBE is zero. That suggests that my coordinate assignment is missing something. Maybe I messed up the direction of vectors?

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the perpendicularity. Wait, line DE is perpendicular to line BC. Since BC is horizontal, DE must be vertical. So line DE is vertical. So E lies directly above or below D. But if I take E as (13, y), then BE is horizontal. But angle CBE is supposed to be 45 degrees. How can this be?

Alternatively, perhaps I assigned the coordinates incorrectly. Let me think again. Maybe I should not have taken AD as horizontal? Maybe I should assign coordinates differently. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach: Let me consider that in the parallelogram, the sides AD and BC are not necessarily horizontal. But the problem mentions that line DE is perpendicular to line BC. Let me instead consider vectors.

Let me denote vector BC as being in some direction, and DE perpendicular to BC. Also, angle at B between C, B, E is 45 degrees. Maybe I need to use trigonometry here.

Wait, going back to the earlier equations. From the coordinates, I had point E at (13, q). Then, angle CBE is formed at point B between points C, B, E. So vectors BC and BE. Wait, vector BC is from B to C, which is (13, 0). Vector BE is from B to E, which is (13 - p, 0). Wait, but that makes angle between them zero. So why is the angle given as 45 degrees? There must be an error here. Perhaps my assumption that E lies vertically above D is wrong?

Wait, line DE is perpendicular to BC. So if BC has slope m, then DE has slope -1/m. But BC is from B to C, which in our previous coordinate system was horizontal, so slope zero. Then DE would be undefined (vertical), which matches. But then, as before, leads to angle CBE being zero. So contradiction. Therefore, my coordinate system is flawed.

Maybe I shouldn't have placed AD horizontally? Let me try a different coordinate system where AD is not horizontal. Let me instead assign coordinates more carefully.

Let me let point A be at (0,0). Let me let vector AB be (a, b), and vector AD be (c, d). Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, coordinates:

A = (0,0)

B = (a, b)

D = (c, d)

C = B + AD = (a + c, b + d)

Then, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(a+c, b+d). Its length is sqrt[(a+c)^2 + (b+d)^2] = 10. Given that AD has length sqrt(c² + d²) = 13. Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB and AD are adjacent sides.

Now, the line BC is from B(a,b) to C(a+c, b+d). So vector BC is (c, d), same as vector AD. Therefore, line BC has direction vector (c, d). Then, line DE is perpendicular to BC, so its direction vector is perpendicular to (c,d). So the slope of BC is d/c, so slope of DE is -c/d.

Now, point E is somewhere on line DE. Let me parametrize line DE. Since DE is perpendicular to BC, and passes through D(c, d)? Wait, no. Wait, line DE starts at D and goes in the direction perpendicular to BC. So line DE is a line starting at D(c, d) and having direction perpendicular to BC. So parametric equations for DE: D + t*(perpendicular vector). For example, if vector BC is (c, d), then a perpendicular vector is (-d, c) or (d, -c). Let's pick (-d, c) as the direction.

Thus, parametric form of DE: (c - dt, d + ct), where t is parameter.

Now, point E lies on this line. Also, triangle DEB is right-angled at E. So angle at E is 90 degrees. So vectors ED and EB are perpendicular. Let me write coordinates for E.

Let me denote E as (c - dt, d + ct). Then vector ED is D - E = (c - (c - dt), d - (d + ct)) = (dt, -ct). Vector EB is B - E = (a - (c - dt), b - (d + ct)) = (a - c + dt, b - d - ct). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(dt)(a - c + dt) + (-ct)(b - d - ct) = 0

Expanding:

dt(a - c) + d t² - ct(b - d) - c t² = 0

Combine like terms:

dt(a - c) - ct(b - d) + t²(d - c) = 0

Factor:

t[ d(a - c) - c(b - d) ] + t²(d - c) = 0

This equation must hold for some t. But this seems complicated. However, there's also the angle CBE = 45 degrees. Let me see if I can relate that.

Angle CBE is the angle at B between points C, B, E. So vectors BC and BE. Vector BC is C - B = (c, d). Vector BE is E - B = (c - dt - a, d + ct - b). The angle between these vectors is 45 degrees. So the cosine of the angle between BC and BE is cos(45°) = √2 / 2.

The formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors u and v is (u ⋅ v)/(|u||v|). So:

[ (c)(c - dt - a) + d(d + ct - b) ] / [ |BC| * |BE| ] = √2 / 2

But |BC| is the length of BC, which is same as |AD| = 13. So |BC| = 13.

Let me compute numerator:

c(c - dt - a) + d(d + ct - b) = c² - act - acd + d² + dct - bd

Group terms:

= (c² + d²) - acd - bd + (-act + dct) 

Wait, let's do term by term:

First term: c*c - c*dt - c*a = c² - act - acd ?

Wait, no:

Original expression: c*(c - dt - a) = c² - cdt - ac

Second term: d*(d + ct - b) = d² + d*ct - db

Adding together:

c² - cdt - ac + d² + d*ct - db 

= (c² + d²) - ac - db + (-cdt + d*ct)

Note that -cdt + d*ct = -cdt + cdt = 0? No, wait, d*ct is d*c*t? Wait, original terms are:

From first expansion: -cdt 

From second expansion: +dct 

Which is same as -cdt + cdt = 0. So those terms cancel out. 

So total numerator becomes (c² + d²) - ac - db. 

Therefore, the numerator simplifies to (c² + d²) - ac - db. 

And denominator is |BC| * |BE| = 13 * |BE|. 

So:

[(c² + d²) - ac - db] / [13 * |BE|] = √2 / 2 

But we also have from earlier that the length of AC is 10. Recall that AC is from A(0,0) to C(a + c, b + d). So:

√[(a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2] = 10 ⇒ (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = 100. 

Also, since AD has length 13, sqrt(c² + d²) = 13 ⇒ c² + d² = 169. 

So substitute that into numerator:

Numerator becomes 169 - ac - db. 

So now we have:

[169 - ac - db] / [13 * |BE|] = √2 / 2 

Let me compute |BE|. 

Vector BE is E - B = (c - dt - a, d + ct - b). So its magnitude squared is:

(c - dt - a)^2 + (d + ct - b)^2 

Let me expand this:

= [ (c - a) - dt ]^2 + [ (d - b) + ct ]^2 

= (c - a)^2 - 2dt(c - a) + d²t² + (d - b)^2 + 2ct(d - b) + c²t² 

Combine terms:

= [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] + [-2dt(c - a) + 2ct(d - b)] + [d²t² + c²t²]

= [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] + 2t[ -d(c - a) + c(d - b) ] + t²(c² + d²)

Let me simplify the middle term:

-d(c - a) + c(d - b) = -dc + da + cd - cb = da - cb 

So overall, |BE|² = [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] + 2t(da - cb) + t²(c² + d²)

But this seems too complex. Perhaps there's a better way. Let me recall that earlier we had from the perpendicularity condition:

t[ d(a - c) - c(b - d) ] + t²(d - c) = 0 

Let me rearrange that:

t[ d(a - c) - c(b - d) ] = -t²(d - c)

Divide both sides by t (assuming t ≠ 0):

d(a - c) - c(b - d) = -t(d - c)

Rearranged:

d(a - c) - cb + cd = -t(d - c)

Left side: da - dc - cb + cd = da - cb 

So:

da - cb = -t(d - c) → t = (cb - da)/(d - c)

So t = (cb - da)/(d - c)

Now, let me plug this value of t into the expression for |BE|². But this might be very involved. Let me think if there's another relation.

Alternatively, since we have expressions involving ac and db, perhaps we can find relations from the earlier equations.

We also know that in a parallelogram, the vectors AB and AD are adjacent sides. So the area of the parallelogram is |AB × AD| = |ab - bc|? Wait, in 2D, the cross product magnitude is |ax * dy - ay * dx|. Wait, if AB is vector (a, b) and AD is vector (c, d), then the area is |a*d - b*c|. So area = |ad - bc|. 

Our goal is to find this value. So if we can find ad - bc, then we have the area. 

So let me note that. Our target is |ad - bc|.

Let me see if I can express ad - bc using the equations we have.

Earlier, we had from the numerator of the cosine expression: 169 - ac - db. Wait, that was from the numerator [169 - ac - db]. But we also have:

Let me think. From the expression for the cosine, we have:

[169 - ac - db]/[13 * |BE|] = √2/2 

So if I can find |BE|, I can relate these quantities. But this seems difficult. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since we have t expressed in terms of a, b, c, d, maybe we can substitute it into the |BE|² expression. Let me attempt that.

Recall that t = (cb - da)/(d - c). Let me denote this as t = N/D, where N = cb - da, D = d - c.

Plugging into |BE|²:

Earlier, |BE|² = [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] + 2t(da - cb) + t²(c² + d²)

Substitute t = (cb - da)/D, where D = d - c.

Note that da - cb = -(cb - da) = -N. So:

|BE|² = [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] + 2t*(-N) + t²(c² + d²)

= [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] - 2t*N + t²(c² + d²)

Substituting t = N/D:

= [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] - 2(N^2)/D + (N²/D²)(c² + d²)

This seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the fact that the area of the parallelogram is |ad - bc|. Let me denote K = ad - bc. Then, the area is |K|.

Also, we have from the diagonal AC: (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = 100. Expanding this:

a² + 2ac + c² + b² + 2bd + d² = 100 

But c² + d² = 169, so:

a² + b² + 2ac + 2bd + 169 = 100 

=> a² + b² + 2(ac + bd) = -69 

Hmm, interesting. Also, note that K = ad - bc. Let me square K: K² = (ad - bc)^2 = a²d² - 2abcd + b²c². Not sure if helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to the other equation. Let me think about the expression for the cosine of 45 degrees. 

We had [169 - ac - db]/[13 * |BE|] = √2/2 

But ac + db = ac + db. Let me see if I can express this in terms of known quantities. From earlier, we have:

From the diagonal equation: a² + b² + 2(ac + bd) = -69. Let me isolate ac + bd:

2(ac + bd) = -69 - a² - b² 

So ac + bd = (-69 - a² - b²)/2 

But I don't know a² + b². However, note that vector AB has length sqrt(a² + b²), and vector AD has length sqrt(c² + d²) = 13. 

Let me denote |AB| = x, |AD| = 13. Then, x² = a² + b², and c² + d² = 169. 

So ac + bd is part of the expression. Also, the area K = ad - bc. 

Let me think about the relationship between these terms. 

Notice that (a² + d²) + (b² + c²) = (a² + b²) + (c² + d²) = x² + 169. 

But not sure. Let me try another angle. 

Perhaps I can use the fact that in the earlier expression for the cosine, the numerator was 169 - ac - db = 169 - (ac + db). And from earlier, ac + db = (-69 - x²)/2. So substituting:

Numerator becomes 169 - (-69 - x²)/2 = 169 + (69 + x²)/2 = (338 + 69 + x²)/2 = (407 + x²)/2. 

So the numerator is (407 + x²)/2. 

But I still don't know x². 

However, the denominator is 13 * |BE|. So:

[(407 + x²)/2] / [13 * |BE|] = √2 / 2 

Multiply both sides by 13 * |BE|:

(407 + x²)/2 = (√2 / 2) * 13 * |BE|

Multiply both sides by 2:

407 + x² = √2 * 13 * |BE| 

But I still don't know |BE|. 

This seems stuck. Let me think if there's another relation. 

Wait, earlier we had t = (cb - da)/ (d - c). And from this, perhaps we can find something about |BE|. 

Alternatively, maybe I can consider specific values. Let me assume that the parallelogram is a rhombus? No, since AD is 13 and AC is 10, which wouldn't fit in a rhombus. 

Alternatively, let me consider that in the parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals is equal to twice the sum of squares of the sides. Wait, the formula is: |AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²). 

Given that |AC| = 10, so |AC|² = 100. Let me denote |BD| as the other diagonal. Then:

100 + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + 13²) 

But we don't know |BD|. However, if I could find |BD|, then I could find |AB|². 

But how?

Alternatively, since we have the right angle at E in triangle DEB, and angle CBE = 45 degrees, perhaps there's a way to relate these to the sides.

Let me try to think geometrically. Since DE is perpendicular to BC, and triangle DEB is right-angled at E, then DE is the altitude from E to BC. Also, angle at B is 45 degrees. 

In triangle DEB, right-angled at E, angle at B is 45 degrees. So it's a 45-45-90 triangle. Wait, if angle at B is 45 degrees, and angle at E is 90 degrees, then the third angle at D would be 45 degrees. So triangle DEB is an isosceles right triangle, with legs DE and BE equal. 

So DE = BE. 

Because in a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal. 

So DE = BE. 

Let me verify this. In triangle DEB, angles at E is 90°, at B is 45°, so angle at D is 45°, making it an isosceles right triangle. Hence, DE = BE.

So DE = BE. 

Now, DE is the length from D to E, and BE is the length from B to E. So |DE| = |BE|.

Let me express DE and BE in terms of coordinates.

Previously, in the general case, point E is somewhere on line DE, which is perpendicular to BC. And we derived that t = (cb - da)/(d - c). 

But if DE = BE, then |DE| = |BE|. 

Let me calculate |DE| and |BE|.

From earlier, vector DE is (dt, -ct), since E is (c - dt, d + ct). Wait, no, earlier in the general case, when I parametrized E as (c - dt, d + ct), then vector DE is E - D = (c - dt - c, d + ct - d) = (-dt, ct). So |DE| = sqrt[ ( -dt )² + (ct)^2 ] = t * sqrt(d² + c²) = t * 13, since c² + d² = 169. 

Similarly, |BE| is the length from B to E, which we previously had as sqrt[ ... ] but let's use the relation DE = BE. So |DE| = |BE| => t * 13 = |BE|.

But from earlier, in the 45-degree condition, we had:

407 + x² = √2 * 13 * |BE| 

But |BE| = t * 13, so:

407 + x² = √2 * 13 * t * 13 = 13² * √2 * t 

But I also have t = (cb - da)/(d - c). Let me recall that K = ad - bc = - (cb - da) = -N, where N = cb - da. So t = N/(d - c) = -K/(d - c). 

But I'm not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since t = (cb - da)/(d - c) = -(ad - bc)/(d - c) = -K/(d - c). 

So t = -K/(d - c). 

Therefore, |BE| = t * 13 = -K * 13/(d - c). 

Substituting into the equation:

407 + x² = 13² * √2 * |BE| = 169 * √2 * | -K * 13/(d - c)| 

Wait, but this introduces new variables. It seems too tangled. 

Let me try to think differently. Since DE = BE, and DE is perpendicular to BC, and BE is part of the triangle. 

In the parallelogram, BC has length 13. Let me consider triangle DEB, which is a right isosceles triangle with legs DE and BE. So DE = BE, and hypotenuse DB. 

Wait, in triangle DEB, right-angled at E, with DE = BE, then hypotenuse DB = DE * sqrt(2). 

So DB = DE * sqrt(2). 

But DB is the length of diagonal BD in the parallelogram. 

In a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals is 2(a² + b²) + 2(c² + d²) ? Wait, no, the formula is |AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²). 

We know |AC| = 10, so:

10² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²) 

Which is:

100 + |BD|² = 2(x² + 169), where x is |AB|. 

So |BD|² = 2x² + 338 - 100 = 2x² + 238. 

But also, from triangle DEB, |BD| = DE * sqrt(2). And DE = |BE|. 

But |BE| is the length from B to E. How to relate this to x?

Alternatively, since DE is perpendicular to BC, and BE is equal to DE, and BC is 13. Let me think of triangle DEB: it's a right isosceles triangle with legs DE and BE. So the length of DE = BE = let's say k. Then, the hypotenuse DB = k√2. 

But DB is the diagonal of the parallelogram, which we've expressed in terms of x. So:

DB² = 2x² + 238 = (k√2)^2 = 2k² → 2x² + 238 = 2k² → x² + 119 = k². 

But what is k? k is the length of DE or BE. Let me see if I can find k.

Since DE is perpendicular to BC, and BC has length 13. Let me imagine projecting E onto BC or something. Alternatively, since DE is perpendicular to BC, and BE is equal to DE, maybe there's a relation here.

Alternatively, since DE is perpendicular to BC, and E is a point such that DE is perpendicular to BC, and BE = DE. Let me think of coordinates again, but more carefully.

Let me consider BC as a line segment of length 13. Let me take BC as horizontal for simplicity, so it's along the x-axis. Let me place point B at (0,0) and point C at (13,0). Then, BC is from (0,0) to (13,0). Line DE is perpendicular to BC, so it's vertical. Let me assume DE is vertical, so D is at some point, and E is on the vertical line through D. Wait, but D is a vertex of the parallelogram. Let me think.

Wait, in this coordinate system, if B is at (0,0) and C is at (13,0), then since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector BC is (13,0). Vector AD should be equal to BC, so AD is also (13,0). So if A is at (a, b), then D is at A + AD = (a + 13, b). But since D is part of the parallelogram, and AB is from A to B, which is (0 - a, 0 - b). 

Wait, this might be getting too convoluted. Let me try to fix coordinates.

Let me set B at (0,0), C at (13,0). Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB = vector DC. Let me let point A be at (p, q). Then, vector AB is B - A = (0 - p, 0 - q) = (-p, -q). Vector DC should be equal to AB. Point D is such that vector DC = AB. Since C is at (13,0), then D = C - AB = (13,0) - (-p, -q) = (13 + p, 0 + q). So D is at (13 + p, q). 

Now, point E is such that DE is perpendicular to BC. BC is horizontal, so DE is vertical. So line DE is vertical. Since D is at (13 + p, q), line DE is vertical, so E has the same x-coordinate as D, which is 13 + p. So E is at (13 + p, r) for some r. 

Now, triangle DEB is right-angled at E. So DE is vertical from D(13 + p, q) to E(13 + p, r). BE is from B(0,0) to E(13 + p, r). The right angle is at E, so DE ⊥ BE. 

Vector DE is (0, r - q). Vector BE is (13 + p - 0, r - 0) = (13 + p, r). Their dot product must be zero:

DE • BE = 0*(13 + p) + (r - q)*r = r(r - q) = 0. 

So either r = 0 or r = q. 

If r = 0, then E is (13 + p, 0), which is on BC line (since BC is from (0,0) to (13,0)). But then DE is from D(13 + p, q) to E(13 + p, 0), so DE has length |q - 0| = |q|. BE is from B(0,0) to E(13 + p, 0), which is along the x-axis. Then angle CBE is the angle at B between C(13,0), B(0,0), and E(13 + p, 0). But points C and E are on the x-axis, so angle CBE is 0 degrees, which contradicts the given 45 degrees. So r = 0 is invalid. 

Thus, r = q. So E is at (13 + p, q). Now, DE is from D(13 + p, q) to E(13 + p, q), which is zero length. That can't be, unless D and E are the same point, which is impossible. So contradiction again. What's wrong here?

Wait, if r = q, then E is (13 + p, q). But D is at (13 + p, q). So E coincides with D. But then DE has length zero, which is not allowed. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, but earlier we had DE • BE = 0, leading to r(r - q) = 0. So either r = 0 or r = q. Both lead to contradictions. What's the issue here?

Ah! Wait, DE is from D to E, and BE is from B to E. The vectors are DE and BE. But in the calculation, I took vector DE as (0, r - q) and vector BE as (13 + p, r). But actually, vector DE is E - D = (13 + p - (13 + p), r - q) = (0, r - q). Vector BE is E - B = (13 + p - 0, r - 0) = (13 + p, r). So their dot product is indeed 0*(13 + p) + (r - q)*r = r(r - q) = 0. 

So this suggests that either r = 0 or r = q. But both lead to problems. So what's wrong here? 

Maybe my coordinate system is flawed. Let me reconsider. Perhaps DE is not vertical? Wait, no, because DE is perpendicular to BC, which is horizontal, so DE must be vertical. 

Wait, but if E is not on the line BC, but somewhere else. Wait, if DE is vertical, then E is vertically aligned with D. But in this case, when r = q, E is at (13 + p, q), which is point D itself. So this suggests that there is no solution under these assumptions, which can't be true. 

This indicates that there's a flaw in the assumption that BC is horizontal. Maybe BC is not horizontal? But how? Because in a parallelogram, BC is equal and parallel to AD. If I don't assume AD is horizontal, then BC can be at any angle. 

Let me try a different approach, using vectors and the fact that DE is perpendicular to BC, and the triangle DEB is right-angled at E with angle CBE = 45 degrees.

Let me denote vector BC as vector v, and vector DE as vector w, which is perpendicular to v. Let me also denote vector BE as vector u. Since triangle DEB is right-angled at E, vectors DE and BE are perpendicular. So w • u = 0. Also, angle between vector BC (v) and vector BE (u) is 45 degrees. 

Let me write down these relationships. 

Let me denote |v| = |BC| = 13. 

Let me denote |w| = |DE|, |u| = |BE|. 

Since DE is perpendicular to BC, w is perpendicular to v. 

Also, in triangle DEB, right-angled at E, we have |DE|^2 + |BE|^2 = |DB|^2. 

But DB is the diagonal of the parallelogram, which we can relate to the other diagonal AC. 

Earlier, we had the formula: |AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²). 

We know |AC| = 10, |AD| = 13. Let me denote |AB| as x. Then:

10² + |BD|² = 2(x² + 13²) → 100 + |BD|² = 2x² + 338 → |BD|² = 2x² + 238. 

But also, from the right triangle DEB: |BD|² = |DE|² + |BE|². 

So:

|DE|² + |BE|² = 2x² + 238. 

But also, from the angle CBE = 45 degrees. Let me consider the angle between vector BC (v) and vector BE (u). This angle is 45 degrees. So:

cos(45°) = (v ⋅ u) / (|v| |u|) 

Let me compute v ⋅ u. Since v is vector BC, and u is vector BE. 

Let me express u as BE = E - B. But how to relate this to v? 

Alternatively, since DE is perpendicular to v, and DE is part of the triangle. Let me think about the relationship between u and v. 

Since DE is perpendicular to v, and DE is a vector from D to E, and BE is from B to E. 

Maybe I can express u = BE = E - B, and w = DE = E - D. 

Since w is perpendicular to v, (E - D) ⋅ v = 0. 

Also, from the right angle at E: w ⋅ u = 0. 

So (E - D) ⋅ (E - B) = 0. 

Let me expand this: (E - D) ⋅ (E - B) = 0. 

Expand: E⋅E - E⋅B - D⋅E + D⋅B = 0. 

Not sure if helpful. 

But also, from the angle between v and u: v ⋅ u = |v| |u| cos(45°). 

Let me try to combine these equations. 

Let me denote v = BC, u = BE, w = DE. 

We have:

1. w ⋅ u = 0 (right angle at E)
2. w ⋅ v = 0 (DE perpendicular to BC)
3. v ⋅ u = |v| |u| cos(45°)

Let me express w = E - D, u = E - B, v = C - B. 

But this might not be helping. 

Let me try to express E in terms of other points. Since w = E - D is perpendicular to v = C - B. 

Let me write this as (E - D) ⋅ (C - B) = 0. 

Also, from the right angle at E: (E - D) ⋅ (E - B) = 0. 

Let me subtract these two equations. 

Wait, let me denote:

Equation 1: (E - D) ⋅ (C - B) = 0 

Equation 2: (E - D) ⋅ (E - B) = 0 

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 

(E - D) ⋅ (E - B) - (E - D) ⋅ (C - B) = 0 

Factor out (E - D): 

(E - D) ⋅ [(E - B) - (C - B)] = 0 

Simplify inside the brackets: E - B - C + B = E - C 

So: (E - D) ⋅ (E - C) = 0 

This means that vector (E - D) is perpendicular to vector (E - C). 

So, point E lies on the circle with diameter DC. Because for any point E, if (E - D) is perpendicular to (E - C), then E lies on the circle with diameter DC. 

But I'm not sure if this helps. 

Alternatively, since E is on the circle with diameter DC, and also satisfies other conditions. 

But this seems too abstract. Let me try to find |BE| and |DE| in terms of other variables. 

From the right triangle DEB: |DE|² + |BE|² = |DB|² = 2x² + 238. 

Also, from the angle condition: v ⋅ u = |v| |u| cos(45°). 

Where v = BC, which has length 13, and u = BE, which has length |BE|. 

Let me express v ⋅ u. Since v = C - B, and u = E - B. So:

v ⋅ u = (C - B) ⋅ (E - B) 

= (C - B) ⋅ E - (C - B) ⋅ B 

But I don't know E. 

Alternatively, let me use the fact that (E - D) ⋅ v = 0, so (E - D) ⋅ v = 0. 

Let me expand this: E ⋅ v - D ⋅ v = 0 → E ⋅ v = D ⋅ v. 

So E ⋅ v = D ⋅ v. 

Also, from v ⋅ u = v ⋅ (E - B) = v ⋅ E - v ⋅ B = D ⋅ v - v ⋅ B. 

But from above, D ⋅ v = E ⋅ v. So v ⋅ u = E ⋅ v - v ⋅ B. 

But I don't know E ⋅ v or v ⋅ B. 

This seems too vague. Let me try to use the earlier relation from the angle. 

Let me denote |BE| = a, |DE| = b. Then, from the right triangle, a² + b² = |DB|² = 2x² + 238. 

Also, from the angle between v and u (where u = BE, v = BC), we have:

v ⋅ u = |v| |u| cos(45°) = 13 * a * (√2/2) = (13a√2)/2. 

On the other hand, v ⋅ u = (C - B) ⋅ (E - B). 

But I need to find this dot product. Let me try to express it in terms of other quantities. 

Since D is a point in the parallelogram, and in the parallelogram, D = B + AD. Vector AD is equal to BC, so AD = BC. So vector AD = BC = v. So D = B + v. 

So D = B + v. 

Thus, D - B = v. 

So, let me substitute D = B + v. 

Then, v ⋅ u = v ⋅ (E - B) = v ⋅ E - v ⋅ B. 

But from earlier, E ⋅ v = D ⋅ v = (B + v) ⋅ v = B ⋅ v + |v|². 

So v ⋅ E = B ⋅ v + |v|². 

Thus, v ⋅ u = (B ⋅ v + |v|²) - v ⋅ B = |v|² = 13² = 169. 

So v ⋅ u = 169. 

But we also have v ⋅ u = (13a√2)/2. 

So:

169 = (13a√2)/2 → a = (169 * 2) / (13√2) = (13 * 13 * 2) / (13√2) = (13 * 2)/√2 = 26 / √2 = 13√2. 

So |BE| = 13√2. 

Now, from the right triangle DEB, a² + b² = |DB|² = 2x² + 238. 

We have a = 13√2, so a² = 338. 

Thus, 338 + b² = 2x² + 238 → b² = 2x² - 100. 

But b is |DE|. Also, from the fact that DE is perpendicular to BC, and DE is a vector from D to E. Let me find |DE|. 

Since DE is perpendicular to BC, and |DE| = b. 

But how to relate b to other quantities? 

Let me recall that in the parallelogram, the area is |AB × AD| = |AB| |AD| sinθ, where θ is the angle between AB and AD. 

But we also have from the diagonal AC: |AC| = 10. 

Using the formula for the length of the diagonal in terms of sides and angle: 

|AC|² = |AB|² + |AD|² + 2 |AB| |AD| cosθ. 

Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy:

|AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²). 

We already used this earlier. 

But we also have |AC| = 10, |AD| = 13, and |BD|² = 2x² + 238, where x = |AB|. 

So, let me write:

|AC|² + |BD|² = 100 + (2x² + 238) = 2x² + 338. 

But this should equal 2(|AB|² + |AD|²) = 2(x² + 169) = 2x² + 338. 

So this checks out, no new information. 

But we also have from the right triangle DEB: b² = 2x² - 100. 

But what is b? |DE| = b. 

But how to find b? 

Let me think about the position of E. Since DE is perpendicular to BC, and DE is a vector from D to E, and |DE| = b. Also, from the earlier calculation, we have |BE| = 13√2. 

Let me try to find b using other relations. 

Let me consider the coordinates again, but with this new information. 

Let me assume that vector BC is v, and |v| = 13. Let me let v = (13, 0) for simplicity, so BC is horizontal. Then, D is at B + v. Let me set B at (0,0), so C is at (13, 0). Then D is at (13, 0) + B - C? Wait, no. If B is at (0,0), and vector BC is (13, 0), then C is at (13, 0). Vector AD is equal to BC, so AD = (13, 0). If A is at (p, q), then D = A + AD = (p + 13, q). 

So D is at (p + 13, q). 

Now, DE is perpendicular to BC, which is horizontal, so DE is vertical. So E is vertically aligned with D. So E has x-coordinate p + 13, and y-coordinate r. 

So E is (p + 13, r). 

Now, BE is from B(0,0) to E(p + 13, r). The length of BE is sqrt((p + 13)^2 + r^2) = 13√2. So:

(p + 13)^2 + r^2 = (13√2)^2 = 338. 

Also, DE is from D(p + 13, q) to E(p + 13, r). So DE has length |q - r|. 

From the right triangle DEB, we have |DE|² + |BE|² = |DB|². 

So (q - r)^2 + 338 = |DB|². 

What is |DB|? D is (p + 13, q), B is (0,0). So |DB|² = (p + 13)^2 + q^2. 

So:

(q - r)^2 + 338 = (p + 13)^2 + q^2 

Expand (q - r)^2: q² - 2qr + r². 

So:

q² - 2qr + r² + 338 = (p + 13)^2 + q^2 

Cancel q² from both sides:

-2qr + r² + 338 = (p + 13)^2 

But from earlier, (p + 13)^2 + r^2 = 338. So replace (p + 13)^2 = 338 - r^2. 

Substitute into the equation:

-2qr + r² + 338 = 338 - r^2 

Simplify:

-2qr + r² = -r² 

→ -2qr + r² + r² = 0 

→ -2qr + 2r² = 0 

→ 2r(r - q) = 0 

So either r = 0 or r = q. 

Case 1: r = 0. Then, from (p + 13)^2 + 0 = 338 → (p + 13)^2 = 338 → p + 13 = ±√338. 

But then DE is from D(p + 13, q) to E(p + 13, 0), so |DE| = |q - 0| = |q|. 

From the right triangle, |DE|² + |BE|² = |DB|². 

Here, |DE|² = q², |BE|² = 338. |DB|² = (p + 13)^2 + q² = 338 + q². 

So q² + 338 = 338 + q², which holds. So this is valid. 

But what about the angle CBE = 45 degrees? Let's check. 

Point C is at (13, 0), B is at (0,0), E is at (p + 13, 0). So points B, C, E are collinear on the x-axis. So angle CBE is 0 degrees, which contradicts the given 45 degrees. So this case is invalid. 

Case 2: r = q. Then, E is at (p + 13, q), which is the same as D, since D is at (p + 13, q). So E = D, which makes DE length zero, which is invalid. 

So both cases lead to contradictions. What's wrong here? 

Wait, this suggests that there's no solution under these assumptions, which can't be true. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. 

Perhaps the issue is that in this coordinate system, with BC as horizontal, the angle CBE cannot be 45 degrees. Maybe BC is not horizontal? 

But how? If BC is not horizontal, then DE is not vertical, and the calculations become more complex. 

Let me try to use the earlier result that |BE| = 13√2, and |DE| = b, with b² = 2x² - 100. 

Also, from the right triangle DEB, we have |BE| = 13√2, |DE| = b, and |DB|² = b² + (13√2)^2 = b² + 338. 

But |DB|² is also equal to 2x² + 238. 

So:

b² + 338 = 2x² + 238 → b² = 2x² - 100. 

But also, from the expression for b², which is |DE|². How to find |DE|? 

Let me recall that DE is perpendicular to BC. Let me consider the projection of DE onto BC. 

Wait, but I'm running out of ideas. Let me recall that the area of the parallelogram is |AB × AD| = |ad - bc| in the earlier notation. 

But we also have from the diagonal AC: (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = 100, and c² + d² = 169. 

Let me expand (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = a² + 2ac + c² + b² + 2bd + d² = (a² + b²) + (c² + d²) + 2(ac + bd) = x² + 169 + 2(ac + bd) = 100. 

So x² + 2(ac + bd) = 100 - 169 = -69 → 2(ac + bd) = -69 - x². 

But I also have from the earlier expression in the cosine of 45 degrees: 169 - ac - db = (407 + x²)/2. Wait, no, earlier I had:

From the numerator of the cosine expression, it was 169 - ac - db = (407 + x²)/2. 

But ac + db = - (69 + x²)/2. 

Wait, let me recheck. From the equation:

x² + 2(ac + bd) = -69 → ac + bd = (-69 - x²)/2. 

So 169 - (ac + db) = 169 - (-69 - x²)/2 = 169 + (69 + x²)/2 = (338 + 69 + x²)/2 = (407 + x²)/2. 

And this was equal to [13 * |BE|] * √2 / 2. 

But we had |BE| = 13√2, so:

(407 + x²)/2 = 13 * 13√2 * √2 / 2 = 13^2 * 2 / 2 = 169. 

Wait, let me compute it properly:

From earlier, we had:

[(407 + x²)/2] = (√2 / 2) * 13 * |BE| 

But we found |BE| = 13√2. Substituting:

(407 + x²)/2 = (√2 / 2) * 13 * 13√2 = (√2 * 13 * 13√2)/2 = (13^2 * 2)/2 = 169. 

So (407 + x²)/2 = 169 → 407 + x² = 338 → x² = 338 - 407 = -69. 

Wait, x² = -69? That's impossible, since x² is a square of real number. 

This suggests a contradiction, indicating a mistake in the earlier steps. 

This implies that there is an error in the logic. Let me trace back. 

When I calculated the numerator for the cosine of the angle, I had:

[169 - ac - db] / [13 * |BE|] = √2 / 2 

But then, from the diagonal equation, I substituted ac + db = (-69 - x²)/2, leading to 169 - ac - db = 169 - (-69 - x²)/2 = (338 + 69 + x²)/2 = (407 + x²)/2. 

But then, assuming |BE| = 13√2, I substituted into the equation and got x² = -69. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the assumption that |BE| = 13√2. Let me revisit that. 

Earlier, I said that v ⋅ u = 169, and also v ⋅ u = |v| |u| cos(45°) = 13 * |BE| * √2/2. So 13 * |BE| * √2/2 = 169 → |BE| = (169 * 2) / (13√2) = (13 * 13 * 2) / (13√2) = (13 * 2)/√2 = 26/√2 = 13√2. 

This seems correct. 

So this leads to x² = -69, which is impossible. This suggests that there is no solution under these constraints, which is impossible because the problem provides answer choices. 

This indicates a critical error in the reasoning. Let me review the steps. 

The key mistake might be in the calculation of v ⋅ u. Let me re-examine that. 

I said that v ⋅ u = (C - B) ⋅ (E - B) = 169. How did I arrive at this? 

Earlier, I said that (E - D) ⋅ v = 0, and from that, E ⋅ v = D ⋅ v. Then, v ⋅ u = v ⋅ (E - B) = v ⋅ E - v ⋅ B = (D ⋅ v) - v ⋅ B. 

But D = B + v, so D ⋅ v = (B + v) ⋅ v = B ⋅ v + |v|². 

So v ⋅ u = B ⋅ v + |v|² - v ⋅ B = |v|² = 13² = 169. 

This seems correct. 

But this leads to |BE| = 13√2, which leads to x² = -69. 

This suggests that the only way to resolve this is if there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps. 

Wait, let me check the calculation where I substituted into the equation (407 + x²)/2 = 169. 

From (407 + x²)/2 = 169 → 407 + x² = 338 → x² = 338 - 407 = -69. 

Yes, this is correct. 

This suggests that there is no solution, which is impossible. 

But since the problem provides answer choices, there must be a solution. This implies that there is a mistake in the assumptions or calculations. 

Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the area is 65, which is 13 * 5, but how? 

Wait, if the area is |ad - bc|, and from the diagonal AC, we have |AC| = 10. 

In a parallelogram, the area can also be calculated using the formula: Area = |AC| * |BD| * sin(theta)/2, where theta is the angle between the diagonals. But I don't know theta. 

Alternatively, using the formula for the area in terms of diagonals and angle between them: Area = (d1 * d2 * sin(theta))/2. 

But I don't know d2 or theta. 

Alternatively, since we have one diagonal AC = 10, and the other diagonal BD. From the earlier formula: |AC|² + |BD|² = 2(|AB|² + |AD|²). 

Let me denote |BD| as y. Then:

100 + y² = 2(x² + 169) → y² = 2x² + 238. 

Also, from the right triangle DEB, we had |DE|² + |BE|² = y² = 2x² + 238. 

But from the angle condition, we had |BE| = 13√2, and |DE| = b, so b² + 338 = 2x² + 238 → b² = 2x² - 100. 

But b is |DE|, and DE is perpendicular to BC, which has length 13. 

Let me consider that in the parallelogram, the area is |AB × AD| = |ad - bc| = K. 

Also, from the diagonal AC: (a + c)^2 + (b +
