MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given points and lines. Let's start by listing out all the given elements:

Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
Lines: BC, CD, FA, AE, GH.
Angles: 1 through 8, with Angle 4 being 101 degrees.

The key information here is that angle 4 measures 101 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 6. 

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to get a better idea. Since there are multiple lines intersecting, maybe some triangles or intersections involved. Let me note down the intersections mentioned:

- IntersectAt(Line(GH), Line(BC), Line(CD), Point(C)): So line GH intersects lines BC and CD at point C. That suggests that point C is where lines BC, CD, and GH meet? Wait, but lines BC and CD share point C, so GH passes through point C as well? So point C is the intersection of lines BC, CD, and GH?

Wait, the wording says "IntersectAt(Line(GH), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Point(C))". Hmm, maybe it means that line GH intersects both lines BC and CD at point C? Which would make sense because lines BC and CD meet at point C, and line GH also passes through C. Therefore, point C is the common intersection of GH, BC, and CD. So GH passes through point C, which is connected to B and D.

Similarly, another intersection: IntersectAt(Line(GH), Line(F,A), Line(A,E), Point(A)). So line GH intersects lines FA and AE at point A. That implies that line GH passes through point A, which is connected to F and E. Therefore, lines FA and AE meet at point A, and line GH also goes through A.

So putting this together, we have several lines intersecting at points A and C. Also, angles 1-8 are present. The specific angles mentioned are angle 4 (which is 101°) and angle 6, which we need to find.

But without seeing the exact figure, I need to deduce based on standard geometric configurations. Let me think about possible triangle relationships or transversal lines.

Let me consider the lines and their intersections. Points A and C seem important. At point A, lines FA and AE meet, and line GH passes through A. Similarly, at point C, lines BC, CD, and GH meet.

Perhaps there are triangles formed here. For example, considering lines FA and AE meeting at A, which might form a triangle with another line. But since GH passes through A, perhaps creating vertical angles or something else.

Alternatively, since GH intersects BC and CD at C, and intersects FA and AE at A, maybe there are vertical angles or corresponding angles due to parallel lines? Wait, but do any of these lines appear to be parallel? Not stated directly, unless inferred from angles.

Given that angle 4 is 101°, which could be part of a triangle or adjacent angles. Let me try to label the angles. However, without knowing the exact positions, this is tricky. Maybe angle 4 is at point C or somewhere else?

Wait, the angles are labeled 1 through 8. Let me think about how many angles each intersection creates. When two lines cross, they create vertical angles. If three lines intersect at a single point, like GH passing through C where BC and CD meet, then there are multiple angles around point C.

Similarly at point A, where FA, AE, and GH meet. Each intersection can generate several angles. So maybe angle 4 is one of those angles at point C or A?

But the question mentions angle 4 equals 101°, and asks for angle 6. Without more details, I need to assume a typical configuration.

Another approach: Since angle 4 is given as 101°, maybe it's an exterior angle or related to other angles via triangle properties. For instance, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, or supplementary angles adding up to 180°, or complementary angles adding to 90°.

If angle 4 is 101°, which is obtuse, maybe it's an angle outside a triangle, making the remote interior angles add up to 79° (since 180 - 101 = 79). But that depends on the context.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is a vertical angle formed by intersecting lines, then its opposite angle is equal. Or if it's part of a linear pair, then adjacent angles would add up to 180°.

Wait, perhaps angle 4 is at point C. Let me think: if lines BC, CD, and GH meet at point C, then angle 4 could be one of the angles formed there. Suppose angle 4 is between BC and GH at point C. Then, depending on the other lines, maybe there are other angles that relate to it.

Alternatively, angle 4 could be at point A. Since GH passes through A, and lines FA and AE meet there. If angle 4 is between FA and GH, then maybe it relates to other angles at that intersection.

But without knowing the exact position, it's challenging. However, since there are eight angles labeled, maybe there's a pattern. Let me consider that angles 1-8 correspond to different angles formed by the intersections.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is part of a triangle where angle 6 is a corresponding or alternate angle. For example, if there are parallel lines, then corresponding angles are equal. But again, no info on parallelism.

Wait, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°. For instance, at point C where lines BC, CD, and GH meet, the sum of angles around that point would be 360°. Similarly at point A.

Suppose angle 4 is one of the angles at point C. Let me assume that. Let me suppose that at point C, there are several angles formed by the intersecting lines. For example, lines BC and CD form a straight line (since they meet at C), so angle BCD is 180°, but with GH passing through C, splitting into smaller angles. If angle 4 is one of those angles created by GH crossing BC and CD.

For example, imagine GH crosses BC and CD at point C, forming angles. If angle 4 is one of those angles, say between BC and GH, then its vertical angle would be equal, and adjacent angles would be supplementary.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is at point A, between FA and GH, then similar logic applies.

But since angle 4 is given as 101°, which is greater than 90°, it's an obtuse angle. If it's at a point where two lines meet, then the adjacent angle would be acute.

Now, let's think about possible relationships. If angle 4 is 101°, then maybe angle 6 is supplementary to it, meaning 180° - 101° = 79°, which is option B. Alternatively, if angle 4 is part of a triangle, then maybe angle 6 is related through triangle angle sums.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is an external angle to a triangle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. For example, if angle 4 is an external angle, then angle 6 could be one of those remote angles. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another possibility: if lines GH and another line form a transversal with parallel lines, then corresponding angles would be equal. But again, no mention of parallel lines.

Alternatively, considering the intersections at A and C, maybe there are vertical angles or alternate interior angles.

Wait, if I consider that angle 4 is at point C, between BC and GH, then maybe angle 6 is at point A, between FA and GH. If lines BC and FA are parallel, then maybe corresponding angles would be equal. But again, no info on parallel lines.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is at point C, and angle 6 is at point A, and if there's a relationship through triangle similarity or congruence.

But without more concrete information, I need to make assumptions based on standard problems.

Since angle 4 is 101°, which is quite large, and the answer choices include 69, 79, etc., which are complements or supplements.

If angle 4 is part of a straight line with angle 6, then angle 6 would be 180 - 101 = 79°, which is option B. This seems plausible. 

Alternatively, if angle 4 is a remote exterior angle, then angle 6 could be one of the remote interior angles. For example, if angle 4 is an exterior angle of a triangle, then angle 6 plus another angle equals 101°, but without knowing which angles are which, this is speculative.

However, given that angle 4 is 101°, and the most straightforward relationship is that if it's adjacent to angle 6 along a straight line, making them supplementary, then angle 6 would be 79°, which is option B. Given that this is a common type of problem, this seems likely.

Therefore, I think the answer is B. 79 degrees.
