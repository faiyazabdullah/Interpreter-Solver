MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C all lying on circle D. That means triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. The lines AB and BC are chords of the circle because they connect two points on the circle. 

The problem mentions angle ABC (which is ∠ABC) and arc AC. It says that the measure of arc AC is 122 degrees. Also, it states that the measure of angle ABC is half of the measure of arc AC. Wait, so according to the given information, ∠ABC = ½ * measure of arc AC. But hold on, isn't there a theorem about angles formed by chords?

Let me recall. There's the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which says that an inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle ABC intercepts arc AC. So yes, according to the theorem, ∠ABC should be half of arc AC. But wait, the problem says that MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C))). Which aligns with the Inscribed Angle Theorem. So then, if arc AC is 122°, then angle ABC would be 122° / 2 = 61°. But looking at the answer choices, option C is 61. However, I need to make sure I'm not missing something here.

Wait, but maybe there's more to it? Let me check again. Points A, B, C are all on the circle. Line AB and BC are chords. So triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. The angle at point B, which is ∠ABC, intercepts arc AC. Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠ABC is indeed half the measure of arc AC. Since arc AC is 122°, then ∠ABC is 61°, which is option C. 

But let me think again—could there be another interpretation? For example, sometimes arcs can be major or minor arcs. If arc AC is 122°, then the rest of the circle would be 360 - 122 = 238°, but since we're dealing with the intercepted arc for angle ABC, which is an inscribed angle. The intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle, so between points A and C not containing B. Wait, but depending on where B is located, the intercepted arc could be the minor arc AC or the major arc AC. But the problem specifies Arc(A,C), which probably refers to the minor arc unless stated otherwise. 

However, if the arc AC was the major arc, then the measure would be 238°, making the angle ABC equal to 119°, but that's not among the answer choices. So the given arc measure must be the minor arc AC, which is 122°, leading to angle ABC being 61°, which is option C. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's some confusion with central angles versus inscribed angles. But no, the problem says that angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. Hence, the measure is half of the arc. So, 122 divided by 2 is 61. 

Therefore, the answer should be option C, 61 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle B $ in triangle $ ABC $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships described:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- All three points $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ lie on the same circle centered at $ D $.  
- Therefore, triangle $ ABC $ is **inscribed** in the circle, meaning each vertex lies on the circumference of the circle.
- The segments $ AB $ and $ BC $ are both **chords** of the circle.
- The arc $ AC $ has a measure of **122°**, as explicitly given.
- The angle $ \angle ABC $ is defined as an **inscribed angle** intercepting arc $ AC $.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

According to the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, the measure of an inscribed angle is **half the measure of its intercepted arc**.

Here, the inscribed angle $ \angle ABC $ intercepts arc $ AC $. Thus:

$$
\text{m} \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{m}(AC)
$$

Substitute the known value:

$$
\text{m} \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 122^\circ = 61^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Verify Consistency with the Problem Statement**

We were told:

> $ \text{MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))} = \text{HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))} $

This confirms that the relationship used above holds true. No contradictions arise from this.

Additionally, since arc $ AC $ measures 122°, it is the **minor arc** (as the major arc would exceed 180°, and thus not be intercepted directly by an inscribed angle like $ \angle ABC $).

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the given data and applying the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, the measure of $ \angle B $ is:

$$
\boxed{61}
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C**
