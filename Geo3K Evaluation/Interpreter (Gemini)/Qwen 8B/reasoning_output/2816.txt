MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. The quadrilateral RSTV is mentioned as a trapezoid, and there are several lines and points involved. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points R, S, T, V forming a trapezoid. Also, points X and Y are involved with various lines. The key given lengths are RS = 6 units and VT = 3 units. Additionally, RX is twice the length of XV, and there are some parallel lines mentioned. 

First, since it's a trapezoid, two sides must be parallel. The problem states that Line(R,S) is parallel to Line(V,T). So RS || VT. That makes sense because in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel, but sometimes they might mention which ones. Wait, actually, in some definitions, trapezoids can have two pairs of parallel sides (like parallelograms), but usually, trapezoid refers to exactly one pair. However, here they specifically say "trapezoid(R,S,T,V)" so maybe it's safe to assume only one pair of parallel sides. But given that RS and VT are specified as parallel, then those are the two bases of the trapezoid.

So RS is the top base with length 6, and VT is the bottom base with length 3. Since they're parallel, the height of the trapezoid would be the distance between these two lines. But maybe we don't need the height directly yet.

Now, looking at the points X and Y. There are lines connecting them:

- Line(R,V): connects R to V
- Line(S,T): connects S to T
- Point X lies on Line(R,V)
- Point Y lies on Line(S,T)
- Lines XY, RV, ST, etc., are connected. Also, there are equalities given about lengths. Specifically:

- Length(RX) equals Length(SY)
- Length(XV) equals Length(YT)
- Also, Length(RX) is twice Length(XV). 

Wait, the problem says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,X)), Mul(2, LengthOf(Line(X,V)))) So RX = 2 * XV. And since RX + XV = RV? Wait, no. Because point X is on line RV, so RX + XV should be equal to RV. But since RX = 2 XV, then substituting gives 2 XV + XV = RV => 3 XV = RV. Therefore, RV = 3 XV. But do we know anything about RV?

Alternatively, maybe we need to find coordinates for the points to calculate the distances. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here.

Let me try assigning coordinates to make this manageable. Let's place the trapezoid in a coordinate system.

Since RS is parallel to VT, and RS has length 6, VT has length 3. Let me consider placing RS horizontally. Let me assign coordinates:

Letâ€™s set point R at (0, 0). Then since RS is 6 units long, point S would be at (6, 0).

Now, since RS || VT, and VT is length 3. Let me think about how to position T and V. In a trapezoid, the legs are RT and SV? Or wait, the sides are RT and SV? Wait, the trapezoid is R-S-T-V-R? Wait, the order is important. The quadrilateral is R-S-T-V. So the sides are RS, ST, TV, VR. So RS is connected to S, then S to T, T to V, V to R. So the trapezoid has RS and VT as the two bases (since they are parallel). So the legs are ST and VR.

But since RS || VT, then the sides ST and VR are the non-parallel sides.

But without knowing more angles or heights, perhaps using coordinates will still work. Let me proceed.

Assume that RS is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Set R at (0, 0), S at (6, 0). Now, since RS || VT, then VT must also be horizontal. Let me denote the y-coordinate for points V and T. Let me suppose that the height of the trapezoid is h. Then, since VT is of length 3, and it's parallel to RS, its endpoints V and T must be somewhere above or below RS. Assuming it's above, let me take h as positive. Wait, but depending on direction, but maybe better to define coordinates properly.

Wait, but since the trapezoid could be oriented in different ways, but let me assume that the trapezoid is convex. Let me try to assign coordinates such that V and T are located above RS.

But to find their exact positions, we might need more info. Alternatively, maybe use vectors or similar triangles.

Another approach: Since there are points X on RV and Y on ST, with certain length relations.

Given that RX = 2 XV, meaning that X divides RV into segments with RX: XV = 2:1. Similarly, since XV = YT (from the equality: Length(XV) = Length(YT)), and also Length(RX) = Length(SY). Let me note that.

Also, since Line(R,X) connects R to X, and Line(S,Y) connects S to Y, and their lengths are equal.

Moreover, Line(X,Y) is another line. The question asks for XY's length.

Hmm. Let me try to model this with coordinates again.

Let me first define coordinates for R, S, T, V. Let me try to assign coordinates such that RS is horizontal, as before.

R = (0, 0)
S = (6, 0)

Now, since RS || VT, and VT is length 3. Let me assume that VT is parallel to RS, so same slope. If RS is horizontal, then VT is horizontal. Let me suppose that T is at some point (a, h) and V is at (b, h), so that the segment VT has length |a - b| = 3. But since it's a trapezoid, the sides ST and VR connect S to T and V to R.

But we need to determine coordinates for T and V. However, without more information, maybe we can express variables.

Alternatively, since we have points X and Y related to RV and ST, maybe we can parametrize their positions.

Let me first handle the points X and Y.

Starting with point X on line RV. Let me parametrize RV. Suppose V has coordinates (v_x, v_y). Then line RV goes from R(0,0) to V(v_x, v_y). Point X divides RV such that RX = 2 XV. This means that X divides RV internally in the ratio RX:XV = 2:1. Therefore, using section formula, coordinates of X can be found.

Similarly, point Y is on line ST. Let me parametrize line ST. Let me assume coordinates for T. Since RS || VT, and RS is horizontal, VT must also be horizontal. So if S is at (6, 0), then T must be at some point (p, q), and V must be at (p - 3, q) since VT length is 3. Wait, because if VT is horizontal, then the x-coordinates differ by 3, while y-coordinates are same.

Wait, assuming that VT is horizontal. Let me assume that both V and T lie at the same y-coordinate, say k. Then, since VT is length 3, the difference in x-coordinates between V and T is 3. But since the trapezoid is RSTV, the order is R-S-T-V-R. So after S, we go to T, then to V, then back to R.

Therefore, the side ST connects S(6, 0) to T(p, k), and then TV connects T(p, k) to V(q, k), such that the length TV is 3, so |q - p| = 3. Then VR connects V(q, k) back to R(0, 0).

But how do I find p and q? Well, since it's a trapezoid, the sides SR and VT are parallel. We already assumed they are horizontal, so that's satisfied.

But the other sides, ST and VR, are not necessarily parallel. However, without additional info, maybe I need to relate coordinates through other constraints.

Alternatively, maybe focus on points X and Y first, considering their relationships.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's find coordinates of X.

Point X is on line RV, dividing it in ratio RX: XV = 2:1. So if R is (0,0) and V is (v_x, v_y), then coordinates of X would be [(2*v_x + 1*0)/ (2+1), (2*v_y + 1*0)/ (2+1)] = (2v_x/3, 2v_y/3). Wait, no. Wait, when you divide a segment internally in ratio m:n, the coordinates are ( (m*x2 + n*x1)/(m +n ), ... )

Here, RX : XV = 2:1, so starting from R to V, X divides RV in ratio RX/XV = 2/1. So m:n is 2:1, so coordinates of X = ( (2*V + 1*R ) / (2+1) ). Thus,

X_x = (2*v_x + 1*0)/3 = 2v_x/3

X_y = (2*v_y + 1*0)/3 = 2v_y/3

Similarly, point Y is on line ST. Let me find coordinates of Y.

But to find Y, I need coordinates of S and T. S is known as (6, 0). T is unknown. However, since ST is part of the trapezoid, and VT is parallel to RS. Since RS is horizontal, VT is horizontal as well. So if T is (t_x, t_y), then V is (t_x - 3, t_y) because VT length is 3 and it's horizontal. Wait, but the direction depends on the orientation. Let me suppose that moving from T to V is towards the left, so that V is at (t_x - 3, t_y). But I need to ensure that the trapezoid closes correctly.

But perhaps there's another way. Since line ST connects S(6,0) to T(t_x, t_y), and line TV connects T(t_x, t_y) to V(v_x, v_y). Since VT is horizontal, then t_y = v_y. Also, since VT has length 3, then |v_x - t_x| = 3. Also, since VR connects V(v_x, v_y) back to R(0,0). 

But without knowing specific values for t_x, t_y, v_x, v_y, it's challenging. However, maybe we can relate the coordinates of Y via the condition that SY equals RX.

Wait, the problem states that Length(RX) equals Length(SY). So once we have coordinates for X and Y, we can compute these lengths.

Additionally, we have that Length(XV) equals Length(YT). Since XV is the segment from X to V, which we can compute from the coordinates of X and V. Similarly, YT is the segment from Y to T.

But maybe instead of getting bogged down in too many variables, I can find expressions in terms of variables and see if something cancels.

Let me attempt to write equations.

First, for point X:

As above, X = (2v_x/3, 2v_y/3)

Then, length RX is the distance from R(0,0) to X(2v_x/3, 2v_y/3):

RX = sqrt[(2v_x/3)^2 + (2v_y/3)^2] = (2/3)sqrt(v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²)

Similarly, XV is the distance from X to V:

V is (v_x, v_y); X is (2v_x/3, 2v_y/3). So vector from X to V is (v_x - 2v_x/3, v_y - 2v_y/3) = (v_x/3, v_y/3). So length XV = sqrt( (v_x/3)^2 + (v_y/3)^2 ) = (1/3)sqrt(v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²)

Which matches with RX being twice XV, since RX = 2*(XV). Which checks out.

Now, moving on to point Y. It lies on line ST. Let me parametrize line ST. Points S(6, 0) and T(t_x, t_y). Let me parameterize Y as a point on ST.

But since we don't know t_x and t_y, maybe we can express Y in terms of parameters. However, we also have the condition that Length(SY) = Length(RX) = (2/3)sqrt(v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²). Also, Length(YT) = Length(XV) = (1/3)sqrt(v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²). 

Additionally, since line ST connects S(6,0) to T(t_x, t_y), and line TV connects T(t_x, t_y) to V(v_x, v_y), which is horizontal (as per earlier assumption). So since VT is horizontal, then t_y = v_y. Let me denote this common y-coordinate as h. So t_y = v_y = h.

Also, since VT has length 3, then |v_x - t_x| = 3. Let me assume that V is to the left of T, so that v_x = t_x - 3. So v_x = t_x - 3. Hence, coordinates of V are (t_x - 3, h).

Now, coordinates of T are (t_x, h), coordinates of V are (t_x - 3, h). Coordinates of S are (6, 0), coordinates of R are (0, 0).

Now, line ST connects S(6, 0) to T(t_x, h). Let me parametrize Y on ST. Let me write parametric equations for ST. Let me use parameter s âˆˆ [0,1], where s=0 corresponds to S and s=1 corresponds to T.

So coordinates of Y can be written as:

Y_x = 6 + s*(t_x - 6)

Y_y = 0 + s*(h - 0) = sh

Now, we need to find s such that Length(SY) equals Length(RX), and Length(YT) equals Length(XV). Let me compute these lengths.

First, Length(SY) is the distance from S(6, 0) to Y(6 + s(t_x -6), sh). Which is sqrt[ (s(t_x -6))Â² + (sh)^2 ].

This should equal Length(RX) = (2/3)sqrt(v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²). But v_x = t_x - 3, v_y = h. So:

sqrt[v_xÂ² + v_yÂ²] = sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + h^2 )

Thus, Length(SY) = (2/3)*sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + h^2 )

Similarly, Length(YT) is the distance from Y to T, which is sqrt[ (t_x - Y_x)^2 + (h - Y_y)^2 ]

Compute t_x - Y_x = t_x - [6 + s(t_x -6)] = t_x -6 - s(t_x -6) = (1 - s)(t_x -6)

h - Y_y = h - sh = h(1 - s)

Thus, Length(YT) = sqrt[ ((1 - s)(t_x -6))^2 + (h(1 - s))^2 ] = (1 - s) * sqrt( (t_x -6)^2 + h^2 )

According to the problem, Length(YT) = Length(XV) = (1/3)*sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + h^2 )

So setting up the equation:

(1 - s) * sqrt( (t_x -6)^2 + h^2 ) = (1/3)*sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + h^2 )

Let me call this Equation (1).

Also, from Length(SY) = (2/3)*sqrt(...), which equals the expression for Length(SY) computed earlier:

sqrt[ sÂ²(t_x -6)^2 + sÂ²hÂ² ] = (2/3)*sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + h^2 )

Square both sides:

sÂ² [ (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² ] = (4/9)[ (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ² ]

Let me call this Equation (2).

Now, we have two equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) involving variables s, t_x, h. However, we might need another relation to solve for these variables. Perhaps we can find another relationship from the fact that RSTV is a trapezoid with RS || VT.

Wait, since RS is parallel to VT, and RS is horizontal (y=0), then VT is also horizontal, which we've already considered. So that's already accounted for.

Is there another constraint? For example, the coordinates of V and T are connected to the rest of the trapezoid. Wait, the side VR connects V to R(0,0). Also, the side ST connects S(6,0) to T(t_x, h). But unless there's more constraints, like slopes or something else, perhaps we need to find relations between t_x and h?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to eliminate variables. Let me try to combine Equations (1) and (2).

From Equation (1):

(1 - s) * sqrt( (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² ) = (1/3)*sqrt( (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ² )

Let me square both sides:

(1 - s)^2 [ (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² ] = (1/9)[ (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ² ]

From Equation (2):

sÂ² [ (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² ] = (4/9)[ (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ² ]

Let me denote A = (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² and B = (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ². Then:

Equation (1) becomes:

(1 - s)^2 * A = (1/9) B â†’ (1 - s)^2 = (B/(9A))

Equation (2) becomes:

sÂ² A = (4/9) B â†’ sÂ² = (4B)/(9A)

Let me substitute B from Equation (2) into Equation (1). From Equation (2):

B = (9A sÂ²)/4

Plugging into Equation (1):

(1 - s)^2 * A = (1/9)*(9A sÂ²)/4 â†’ Simplify RHS: (1/9)*(9A sÂ²)/4 = (A sÂ²)/4

Thus:

(1 - s)^2 * A = (A sÂ²)/4

Assuming A â‰  0 (which it isn't, since otherwise the trapezoid would collapse), we can divide both sides by A:

(1 - s)^2 = (sÂ²)/4

Take square roots? Or expand:

Expand LHS: 1 - 2s + sÂ² = sÂ² /4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4 - 8s + 4sÂ² = sÂ²

Bring all terms to left:

4 -8s +4sÂ² -sÂ² = 0 â†’ 4 -8s +3sÂ² = 0 â†’ 3sÂ² -8s +4 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

s = [8 Â± sqrt(64 - 48)] / 6 = [8 Â± sqrt(16)] /6 = [8 Â±4]/6 â†’ s=(8+4)/6=12/6=2 or s=(8-4)/6=4/6=2/3

But s is a parameter along ST from S to T, so s âˆˆ [0,1]. Therefore, s=2 is invalid. So s=2/3.

So s=2/3.

Now, plugging back s=2/3 into Equation (2):

sÂ² A = (4/9) B â†’ (4/9) A = (4/9) B â†’ A=B ?

Wait, no. Wait, Equation (2) was sÂ² A = (4/9) B. With s=2/3:

Left side: ( (2/3)^2 ) * A = (4/9) A

Right side: (4/9) B â†’ So equate:

(4/9) A = (4/9) B â‡’ A = B.

Thus, (t_x -6)^2 + hÂ² = (t_x -3)^2 + hÂ² â†’ Subtract hÂ² from both sides:

(t_x -6)^2 = (t_x -3)^2 â†’ Expand both sides:

t_xÂ² -12t_x +36 = t_xÂ² -6t_x +9 â†’ Subtract t_xÂ² from both sides:

-12t_x +36 = -6t_x +9 â†’ Rearranged:

-12t_x +36 +6t_x -9 =0 â†’ -6t_x +27=0 â†’ -6t_x = -27 â†’ t_x = 27/6 = 9/2 = 4.5

So t_x = 9/2 = 4.5.

Now, we can find t_x = 4.5, so coordinates of T are (4.5, h). Coordinates of V are (t_x -3, h) = (4.5 - 3, h) = (1.5, h). So V is at (1.5, h).

Now, we can now find the value of h. How?

Well, since we have other conditions? Let's check if there are any missing constraints.

We haven't used the fact that RSTV is a trapezoid, but we already ensured that RS || VT. Are there any other constraints?

Perhaps the fact that the sides ST and VR connect appropriately. But since we've already defined the coordinates, maybe we can find h through another relation.

Wait, but we might need to use the fact that the lines XY exist and possibly other relations. However, the question is asking for the length of XY, which is the line connecting X and Y.

So, once we have coordinates for X and Y, we can compute XY.

Let me find coordinates for X and Y.

First, X is on RV. Earlier, we had coordinates for V as (1.5, h). Coordinates of R are (0,0). So line RV connects (0,0) to (1.5, h). As earlier, X divides RV in ratio RX: XV = 2:1. So coordinates of X are ( (2*1.5 + 1*0)/3 , (2*h + 1*0)/3 ) = (3/3, 2h/3 ) = (1, 2h/3 ).

So X is at (1, 2h/3).

Now, for Y, which is on ST. We had earlier determined that s=2/3. So coordinates of Y are:

Y_x = 6 + s*(t_x -6) = 6 + (2/3)*(4.5 -6) = 6 + (2/3)*(-1.5) = 6 - (2/3)*(3/2) = 6 - 1 = 5

Y_y = s*h = (2/3)h

Thus, Y is at (5, 2h/3)

So coordinates:

X = (1, 2h/3)

Y = (5, 2h/3)

So the line XY connects (1, 2h/3) to (5, 2h/3). Since the y-coordinates are the same, this is a horizontal line. The length of XY is the difference in x-coordinates: 5 -1 = 4 units. Therefore, XY = 4.

Wait, that seems straightforward! So regardless of h, the length of XY is 4. Therefore, the answer is B. 4.

But let me verify this conclusion. Did I miss any steps?

Yes, let me recheck the calculation for Y's coordinates.

t_x is 4.5, so t_x -6 = 4.5 -6 = -1.5. Then, s = 2/3, so:

Y_x = 6 + (2/3)*(-1.5) = 6 - (2/3)*(3/2) = 6 - 1 = 5. Correct.

Y_y = (2/3)*h. Correct.

Coordinates of X were (1, 2h/3). Coordinates of Y are (5, 2h/3). So yes, same y-coordinate, so XY is horizontal, length is 5 -1 =4. So XY=4. So answer is B.

But let me confirm that there are no errors in the logic. For instance, did we use all given constraints?

We used the fact that RS || VT, which led us to set VT horizontal. We used the ratios for RX and XV, and for SY and YT. Also, we found that t_x = 4.5, leading to coordinates for T and V. Then found coordinates for X and Y, and found XY length as 4.

But what about the value of h? Is there any dependency on h? For example, does h affect the length of XY? In our calculation, h canceled out, so regardless of h, XY is always 4. So even though we didn't find h, it doesn't matter for the length of XY. Therefore, the answer is B. 4.

Let me check if there's another way this could be approached, just to confirm.

Alternative approach: Since RS || VT, and RX = 2 XV, and SY = RX, YT = XV. Also, since RS = 6 and VT = 3, which are in ratio 2:1. This suggests similarity or proportionality.

If we consider the trapezoid, with bases RS and VT in ratio 2:1. Points X and Y are taken such that RX = 2 XV and SY = 2 YT? Wait, no, SY = RX, and YT = XV. Given that RX = 2 XV, then SY = 2 XV, and YT = XV. So SY = 2 YT. So SY/YT = 2. Which suggests that Y divides ST in the ratio SY:YT = 2:1. Similarly, X divides RV in ratio RX:XV = 2:1.

This implies that lines XY might be parallel to the bases? Or form similar triangles?

Alternatively, since both X and Y divide their respective sides in ratio 2:1, then the line XY might be parallel to the bases RS and VT. If that's the case, then the length of XY can be calculated via weighted average.

But in a trapezoid, if a line is drawn through points dividing the legs in the same ratio, then it's parallel to the bases and its length is weighted average. 

Wait, in general, if you have a trapezoid with bases of lengths a and b, and a line is drawn through points that divide the legs proportionally, then the length of the line is (a + b)/2 if divided equally, but if divided in ratio m:n, then the length is (na + mb)/(m +n). 

Wait, in our case, the division ratios for the legs. Let me think. Here, the legs are RV and ST. Wait, in our case, point X divides RV in ratio RX:XV = 2:1, and point Y divides ST in ratio SY:YT = 2:1 (since SY = 2 XV = 2 YT). So if the ratio is the same, then the line XY is parallel to the bases and its length is (RS + VT)/something. Wait, if the ratio is 2:1, then the formula would give (1*RS + 2*VT)/(2 +1) ? Or vice versa?

The formula for a line dividing the legs in ratio m:n (from top to bottom) would be (n*a + m*b)/(m +n). So if the ratio is m:n, then the length is (n*a + m*b)/(m +n). 

In our case, the division ratio for both legs is 2:1 (from top to bottom?), but need to clarify direction. 

For leg RV, going from R to V, the division is RX:XV = 2:1. So from R to V, it's divided as 2:1. So m:n = 2:1, where m is the portion near R, and n near V. Similarly, for leg ST, the division is SY:YT = 2:1. So from S to T, it's divided as SY:YT = 2:1. So same ratio. 

Thus, applying the formula, the length of XY would be (n*RS + m*VT)/(m +n). Wait, but need to check direction. 

Actually, the formula is: if a line crosses the legs of a trapezoid dividing them proportionally, then the length of the line is (a*n + b*m)/(m +n), where a and b are the lengths of the bases, and m:n is the ratio of the segments on each leg. 

But in our case, the ratio is m:n = 2:1 for both legs. So m = 2, n = 1. Then the length of XY would be (a*1 + b*2)/(2 +1) = (a + 2b)/3. 

Wait, but which base is a and which is b? If a is the upper base RS = 6, and b is lower base VT = 3, then:

XY = (6*1 + 3*2)/3 = (6 +6)/3 = 12/3 = 4. Which matches our previous result. So XY = 4. Hence, answer is B.

This confirms that regardless of the method, the answer is 4. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure described and identifying the relationships among the points and lines. The core elements include:

- **Quadrilateral $ RSTV $** forms a **trapezoid**, with $ \overline{RS} \parallel \overline{VT} $
- Given lengths:  
  - $ \text{Length}(\overline{RS}) = 6 $  
  - $ \text{Length}(\overline{VT}) = 3 $  
- Additional constraints:  
  - $ \text{Length}(\overline{RX}) = 2 \times \text{Length}(\overline{XV}) $  
  - $ \text{Length}(\overline{SY}) = \text{Length}(\overline{RX}) $  
  - $ \text{Length}(\overline{YT}) = \text{Length}(\overline{XV}) $

These imply proportional divisions on the legs $ \overline{RV} $ and $ \overline{ST} $. The key insight is recognizing that the points $ X $ and $ Y $ divide the legs in the same ratio (i.e., $ 2:1 $), suggesting that the segment $ \overline{XY} $ is **parallel** to the bases $ \overline{RS} $ and $ \overline{VT} $, and its length can be derived using a **weighted average**.

---

### Step-by-Step Derivation

#### 1. **Use Proportional Division**
- Since $ \frac{\text{RX}}{\text{XV}} = 2 $, point $ X $ divides $ \overline{RV} $ in the ratio $ 2:1 $.
- Similarly, $ \frac{\text{SY}}{\text{YT}} = 2 $, so point $ Y $ divides $ \overline{ST} $ in the ratio $ 2:1 $.

#### 2. **Apply Trapezoid Segment Formula**
When a line intersects the legs of a trapezoid at a constant ratio, the length of the resulting segment is given by:

$$
\text{Length}(\overline{XY}) = \frac{n \cdot a + m \cdot b}{m + n}
$$

Where:
- $ a = \text{Length}(\overline{RS}) = 6 $,
- $ b = \text{Length}(\overline{VT}) = 3 $,
- Ratio $ m:n = 2:1 $ (from the division on both legs),

Substitute values:

$$
\text{Length}(\overline{XY}) = \frac{1 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 3}{2 + 1} = \frac{6 + 6}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
$$

### Final Conclusion

Using either coordinate geometry or the generalized formula for a line intersecting a trapezoid's legs in a fixed ratio, we consistently arrive at the same result: the length of segment $ \overline{XY} $ is **4 units**.
