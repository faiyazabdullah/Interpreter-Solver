MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given points and lines. Let me note down all the information provided.

We have points Q, P, M, N. The lines mentioned are Line(Q,P), Line(P,N), Line(P,M), Line(M,N). Also, there are angles defined: Angle(M,P,N), Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(P,M,N), Angle(M,N,P). Some measures are given as equalities. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,N)) = 56 degrees, MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)) = 45 degrees. Additionally, it's stated that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,N)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N))) equals 180. Wait, but angle (P,M,N) is the same as angle PMN? Or maybe different notation? Wait, angles are named with three letters, so Angle(M,P,N) would be the angle at point P between points M and N. Similarly, Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at point N between points M and P. And Angle(P,M,N) is the angle at point M between points P and N?

Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So:

- Angle(M,P,N): vertex at P, sides PM and PN. So that's angle MPN at point P.

- Angle(M,N,P): vertex at N, sides NM and NP. So that's angle MNP at point N.

- Angle(P,M,N): vertex at M, sides PM and MN. So that's angle PMN at point M.

Then, we also have Angle(M,P,Q): vertex at P, sides PM and PQ. So angle MPQ at point P.

The triangle given is Triangle(M,P,N), which makes sense since those three points form a triangle.

Now, the first equality given is SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,N)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N))) = 180. Wait, let me parse each term:

Angle(P,M,N) is angle at M: PMN.

Angle(M,N,P) is angle at N: MNP.

Angle(M,P,N) is angle at P: MPN.

So adding these three angles together gives the sum of the angles in triangle MPN. Since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180°, this checks out. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,N)) = 56°, MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)) = 45°, so the third angle at P, which is angle MPN, should be 180 - 56 -45 = 79°. Wait, but wait, the given measure for angle(P,M,N) is 56°, which is angle at M (PMN), and angle(M,N,P) is angle at N (MNP) which is 45°, then angle at P (MPN) would be 180 - 56 -45 = 79°. Therefore, angle MPN is 79°, which is the angle at P between points M and N. But wait, in the problem statement, they mention another angle: Angle(M,P,Q), which is the angle at P between points M and Q. 

Also, there's another equality: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,Q))) = 180. Wait, Angle(M,P,N) is the angle at P between M and N, which we just found to be 79°, right? Because angle MPN is 79°. Then, the sum of that angle (79°) and angle MPQ (which is Angle(M,P,Q)) equals 180°. Therefore, angle MPQ would be 180 - 79 = 101°, which would make the answer D. But let me check again.

Wait, let me confirm each step carefully.

First, the triangle MPN has angles:

At M: angle PMN = 56° (given).

At N: angle MNP = 45° (given).

Therefore, angle at P (MPN) is 180 - 56 - 45 = 79°, yes.

Then, the second equation says SumOf(Angle(M,P,N) + Angle(M,P,Q)) = 180. Wait, Angle(M,P,N) here refers to the angle at P between M and N, which is angle MPN = 79°, as above. Therefore, 79° + measure of angle MPQ = 180°, hence angle MPQ is 180 - 79 = 101°, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, let me check if there's more to it. Are there any other constraints or relations?

Another thing mentioned is PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(Q,N)). That means point Q lies on line QN. But since Q is already on line QN, that seems redundant. However, also PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Q,N)) implies that point P lies on line QN. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(Q,N)) which is obvious since N is on line QN.

So, line QN passes through points Q, P, and N. Therefore, points Q, P, N are colinear in that order? Wait, but line QN can be extended in both directions. If P is on line QN, then the order could be Q---P---N or N---P---Q, depending on the positions. However, considering the triangle MPN, points M and N are connected via line MN, and point P is connected to M and N. 

But perhaps the key here is that since P lies on line QN, then angle MPQ is formed at point P between points M and Q. Since Q is on line QN, which includes P and N, then Q is on the extension of PN beyond N or beyond P? Depending on where Q is located.

But regardless, the key relation comes from the fact that angle MPN (at P between M and N) is 79°, and angle MPQ (at P between M and Q) plus angle MPN equals 180°, because Q lies on line PN extended. Wait, if Q is on line QN, and P is on line QN, then Q, P, N are colinear. Therefore, the line QN contains points Q, P, N. Therefore, when you look at angle MPQ at point P, between points M and Q, since Q is on line PN, then the angle between PM and PQ would be supplementary to angle MPN. Because PQ is along the line PN, so extending from P through N to Q. Therefore, angle MPQ would be adjacent to angle MPN, forming a straight line. Hence, their measures add up to 180°. 

Thus, angle MPQ = 180° - angle MPN = 180° - 79° = 101°, which is option D. Therefore, the answer should be D. But let me double-check if there's any mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angles. Let me re-express:

Angle(M,P,N) is the angle at P between M and N → angle MPN = 56°? Wait wait, earlier I thought that angle(P,M,N) was angle at M. Wait, confusion arises from notation. Let me clarify once again.

In standard notation, angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A and C. Therefore:

- Angle(M,P,N) is angle at P between M and N → ∠MPN.

- Angle(M,N,P) is angle at N between M and P → ∠MNP.

- Angle(P,M,N) is angle at M between P and N → ∠PMN.

Wait, the user wrote:

"Angle(M,P,N)" → vertex P, sides PM and PN → ∠MPN.

"Angle(M,N,P)" → vertex N, sides NM and NP → ∠MNP.

"Angle(P,M,N)" → vertex M, sides PM and MN → ∠PMN.

So given:

MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,N)) = 56 → ∠PMN = 56°.

MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)) = 45 → ∠MNP = 45°.

Sum of ∠PMN + ∠MNP + ∠MPN = 180°, so ∠MPN = 180 - 56 -45 = 79°.

Then, the next equality: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N)), MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,Q))) = 180. Here, Angle(M,P,N) is ∠MPN = 79°, and Angle(M,P,Q) is ∠MPQ. Therefore:

79 + ∠MPQ = 180 → ∠MPQ = 101°, which is option D.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is D. 101°, which is option D.

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key steps were identifying the angles correctly and using the fact that points Q, P, N are colinear, making angle MPQ supplementary to angle MPN.
