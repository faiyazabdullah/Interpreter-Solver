MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the triangles relate to each other. 

We have two triangles: Triangle L,M,N and Triangle X,Y,Z. The problem gives several angle measures and relationships between them. Let me jot down the key points:

Starting with Triangle L,M,N:
- Angle at N (Angle(N,L,M)) is 65 degrees.
- Angle at M (Angle(L,M,N)) is 51 degrees.
- The third angle at L would then be... Well, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so 65 + 51 = 116, so the remaining angle at L is 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Wait, but wait—let me check that again. The angles are Angle(L,M,N) which is at M? Wait, no. Wait, the notation for angles can be confusing here. Let me clarify.

In standard notation, Angle(L,M,N) means the angle at point M, between points L and N. So, in Triangle L,M,N, the angles are:
- At vertex M: Angle(L,M,N) = 51°
- At vertex N: Angle(N,L,M) = 65°
Wait, hold on. Wait, Angle(N,L,M) would be the angle at point L, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(N,L,M) is the angle at L, between N and M. Similarly, Angle(L,M,N) is the angle at M. Then the third angle at N would be the remaining one.

So let's compute all three angles of Triangle L,M,N:

Given:
MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,M)) = 65° → This is the angle at L.
MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,N)) = 51° → This is the angle at M.
Therefore, the third angle at N would be 180 - 65 - 51 = 64°. Wait, 65+51=116, so 180-116=64. So angle at N is 64°.

Now, moving to Triangle X,Y,Z. There are some congruence and similarity relations given. Let me note the constraints:

- Congruent(Angle(L,M,N), Angle(Y,Z,X)): So Angle(L,M,N) is the angle at M in Triangle L,M,N, which we found as 51°, so this angle is congruent to Angle(Y,Z,X). Therefore, Angle(Y,Z,X) is also 51°. But Angle(Y,Z,X) is the angle at Z in Triangle X,Y,Z. Wait, again, notation: Angle(Y,Z,X) is the angle at Z between Y and X. So in Triangle X,Y,Z, the angle at Z is 51°.

Then, Congruent(Angle(N,L,M), Angle(X,Y,Z)). Angle(N,L,M) is the angle at L in Triangle L,M,N, which was 65°, so Angle(X,Y,Z) is congruent to that. So Angle(X,Y,Z) is 65°. That angle is the angle at Y in Triangle X,Y,Z, because it's Angle(X,Y,Z): the middle letter is Y. So angle at Y is 65°.

Also, there's Similarity between Triangle L,M,N and Triangle Y,Z,X. So similar triangles mean their corresponding angles are equal. Also, since they're similar, the order matters. The similarity is stated as Similar(Triangle(L,M,N), Triangle(Y,Z,X)), so the correspondence is L→Y, M→Z, N→X. Wait, because the order is important for similarity. If Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF, then angle A corresponds to D, B to E, C to F. So here, Triangle L,M,N ~ Triangle Y,Z,X. So:

- Angle at L (which is 65°) corresponds to angle at Y (since first letters L and Y).
- Angle at M (which is 51°) corresponds to angle at Z.
- Angle at N (which is 64°) corresponds to angle at X.

But wait, earlier we had Angle(Y,Z,X) being 51°, which is the angle at Z in Triangle X,Y,Z. Wait, maybe I need to reconcile these.

Alternatively, perhaps the similarity implies that the angles correspond accordingly. Let me think again.

If Triangle L,M,N ~ Triangle Y,Z,X, then the angles correspond as follows:

Angle L corresponds to Angle Y,
Angle M corresponds to Angle Z,
Angle N corresponds to Angle X.

So, measure of Angle L (which is 65°) equals measure of Angle Y (in Triangle X,Y,Z),
measure of Angle M (which is 51°) equals measure of Angle Z (in Triangle X,Y,Z),
and measure of Angle N (which is 64°) equals measure of Angle X (in Triangle X,Y,Z).

But earlier, from the congruences:

- Congruent(Angle(L,M,N), Angle(Y,Z,X)): Angle(L,M,N) is angle at M (51°), so Angle(Y,Z,X) is angle at Z (since in Triangle X,Y,Z, Angle(Y,Z,X) is angle at Z). So that matches with the similarity statement, because Angle Z in Triangle X,Y,Z is 51°, which matches Angle M in Triangle L,M,N.

Similarly, Congruent(Angle(N,L,M), Angle(X,Y,Z)): Angle(N,L,M) is angle at L (65°), so Angle(X,Y,Z) is angle at Y in Triangle X,Y,Z. Which according to the similarity should correspond to Angle L in Triangle L,M,N, which is 65°, so that checks out.

So that confirms the similarity. Now, for Triangle X,Y,Z, we know two angles:

- Angle at Z: 51° (from above)
- Angle at Y: 65° (from above)

Therefore, the third angle at X would be 180 - 51 - 65 = 64°, same as in Triangle L,M,N.

Now, looking at the question: Find x, where MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,Y)) = Mul(4,x). Wait, Angle(Z,X,Y) is the angle at X in Triangle X,Y,Z. Wait, Angle(Z,X,Y) is the angle at X between Z and Y. So in Triangle X,Y,Z, the angles are:

At Y: 65°
At Z: 51°
At X: 64°

Wait, but according to the problem, Angle(Z,X,Y) is equal to 4x. So that angle is at X, which we just said is 64°, so 4x = 64. Therefore, solving for x: x = 64 / 4 = 16. Therefore, x is 16. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 16. So the answer should be B.

Let me verify once more to make sure I didn't mix up any angles.

First, confirm the angles in Triangle L,M,N:

- Angle at L (N,L,M) is 65°
- Angle at M (L,M,N) is 51°
- Therefore, angle at N is 180 - 65 - 51 = 64°

Then, Triangle X,Y,Z:

Because of similarity with Triangle L,M,N, the angles correspond:

- Angle at Y (corresponding to L) is 65°
- Angle at Z (corresponding to M) is 51°
- Angle at X (corresponding to N) is 64°

Thus, Angle(Z,X,Y) is the angle at X, which is 64°. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,Y)) = 4x, so 4x = 64 => x = 16. Hence, answer B.
