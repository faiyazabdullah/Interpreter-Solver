MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a circle C, and points J and K that lie on the circle. Also, lines CK and CJ are radii of the circle. The lengths of these radii are given as 2 units each. Then there's an angle at point C between points J and K, which measures 30 degrees. We need to find the length of arc JK, which is denoted as $\widehat{JK}$.

First, I remember that the length of an arc in a circle can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = r \theta
$$

where $ r $ is the radius of the circle and $ \theta $ is the central angle in radians. But wait, the angle given here is in degrees (30°), so I'll need to convert that to radians first.

But before jumping into calculations, let me confirm the details. The circle has center C, right? Because both CJ and CK are radii. So point C is the center of the circle. Points J and K are on the circumference, so the distance from C to J and C to K is the radius, which is 2 units. That makes sense because they said the length of CJ and CK is 2. 

So, the angle at the center C between points J and K is 30 degrees. Therefore, the arc JK corresponds to this central angle. Hence, the arc length should be based on that angle.

So, converting 30 degrees to radians. Since π radians equals 180 degrees, then 30 degrees is π/6 radians. Let me check that calculation again. Yes, 30° × (π radians / 180°) = π/6 radians.

Now plugging into the arc length formula:

Arc Length = rθ = 2 × (π/6). Let me compute that. π is approximately 3.1416, so π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians. Multiplying by 2 gives 2 × 0.5236 ≈ 1.0472. Rounded to the nearest hundredth would be 1.05. Hmm, looking at the answer choices, option C is 1.05. Wait, but let me make sure there isn't a mistake here.

Wait, another thought: Is the angle given actually the central angle? The problem says Angle(J, C, K), which is angle at point C between points J and K. So yes, that is the central angle. Therefore, the arc length is indeed determined by that angle. So my calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion? Let me verify once more. 30 degrees in radians is π/6. Multiply by radius 2: 2*(π/6)= π/3 ≈ 1.047197... So rounding to two decimal places, it's 1.05. So answer choice C is 1.05. That matches.

But let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. For example, could there be something about the sector or the arc that I'm missing? The problem mentions Sector(C, J, K), which is the sector formed by points J, K, and center C. The arc JK is part of that sector. So the arc length is still dependent only on the central angle and radius. So no issues here.

Another thing to check: Are there any other angles or relationships? The problem states that J and K are on the circle, so triangleCJK is an isosceles triangle with sides CJ=CK=2, and angle at C being 30 degrees. But that doesn't affect the arc length directly. The arc length depends solely on the central angle and radius. So my initial approach was correct.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 1.05, which is option C. Let me check the answer choices again:

A. 0.52  
B. 0.79  
C. 1.05  
D. 1.57  

Yes, C is 1.05. So I think that's the correct answer. However, just to ensure that there isn't a miscalculation. Let me recalculate π/6 * 2:

π ≈ 3.1416  
π/6 ≈ 0.5236  
Multiply by 2: 0.5236 * 2 = 1.0472. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 1.05. Correct.

So Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of the arc $\widehat{JK}$, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- Circle $C$ has center at point $C$, and points $J$ and $K$ lie on its circumference.
- Lines $CJ$ and $CK$ are radii of the circle, and their lengths are explicitly stated to be 2 units.
- The angle $\angle JCK$ is given as $30^\circ$, which is the **central angle** subtended by the arc $\widehat{JK}$.

---

### Step 1: Understanding Arc Length Formula

The arc length $s$ of a circle corresponding to a central angle $\theta$ (in radians) is given by the formula:

$$
s = r \cdot \theta
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the circle,
- $\theta$ is the measure of the central angle in **radians**.

---

### Step 2: Convert Central Angle to Radians

Given that the central angle is $30^\circ$, we convert this to radians:

$$
\theta = 30^\circ \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}
$$

---

### Step 3: Plug Into the Arc Length Formula

We know the radius $r = 2$. Using the formula:

$$
s = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3}
$$

Approximating $\pi \approx 3.1416$:

$$
s \approx \frac{3.1416}{3} \approx 1.0472
$$

Rounding to the nearest hundredth:

$$
s \approx 1.05
$$

### Step 4: Match With Answer Choices

Among the given choices:
- A. 0.52  
- B. 0.79  
- C. 1.05  
- D. 1.57  

The value $1.05$ matches **option C**.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{C}
