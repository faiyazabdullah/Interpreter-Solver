====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have two triangles, triangle BCD and triangle WXY, which are congruent. The question is asking for the value of x. Let me start by listing all the given information and see how I can relate them.

First, the triangles are congruent, so their corresponding sides and angles should be equal. Let me recall that congruence means all corresponding parts are equal. So, for triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, each side and angle corresponds. But I need to make sure which parts correspond. Wait, the order of the letters matters here. Since it's written as triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, that would mean vertex B corresponds to W, C corresponds to X, and D corresponds to Y. So:

- BC corresponds to WX
- CD corresponds to XY
- BD corresponds to WY

Also, the angles:

- Angle at B (angle B) corresponds to angle at W
- Angle at C corresponds to angle at X
- Angle at D corresponds to angle at Y

Wait, but looking back at the given angles, there are several angles mentioned. Let me check the problem again.

The problem mentions several angles:

For triangle BCD:
- Angle(C,B,D): This is angle at point B between points C and D? Wait, no. In standard notation, angle(C,B,D) would be the angle at point B, formed by points C, B, D. Wait, actually, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So angle(C,B,D) is angle at B, with segments BC and BD. Similarly, angle(B,C,D) is angle at C, between B, C, D. And angle(B,D,C) is angle at D between B, D, C.

Similarly for triangle WXY, the angles given are angle(X,W,Y), angle(W,X,Y), angle(W,Y,X). So angle at W, X, Y respectively.

But since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles must be equal. Also, some equations are given involving lengths and angles. Let me note down all the given equations:

1. Length of BC = 11. Also, length of WX equals 2x + 5. Since BC corresponds to WX, they should be equal. Therefore:

BC = WX → 11 = 2x + 5. Solving this gives 2x = 6 → x=3. But wait, maybe there are more equations that involve x? Because the answer choices include 3 as option B. However, let me check if there are other equations that might affect this.

But before jumping to conclusion, let me check if there are other equations involving x. For example, the measure of angle(B,C,D) is given as 20x - 4, and measure of angle(C,B,D) is 24x + 5. Also, measure of angle(X,W,Y) is 77 degrees. Also, since the triangles are congruent, certain angles must be equal.

Let me think about the angles. Since triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, then:

- Angle at B (which is angle(C,B,D)) corresponds to angle at W (which is angle(X,W,Y)). Wait, angle(C,B,D) is angle at B, which in triangle BCD. In triangle WXY, angle(X,W,Y) is the angle at W. So yes, those angles are corresponding. Therefore, measure(angle(C,B,D)) = measure(angle(X,W,Y)).

Given that measure(angle(X,W,Y)) is 77°, so measure(angle(C,B,D)) = 77°. But according to the problem statement, measure(angle(C,B,D)) is given as 24x + 5. Therefore:

24x + 5 = 77 → 24x = 72 → x = 3. That seems consistent with earlier calculation from the side lengths. So x=3?

But let me check if there are more equations. For instance, another equation says measure(angle(B,C,D)) equals measure(angle(W,X,Y)). Let me parse that.

In triangle BCD, angle(B,C,D) is the angle at point C. In triangle WXY, angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at Y. Wait, because angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X? No, angle notation: angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between points W, X, Y. Wait, no, angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X. Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X. Therefore, since triangles are congruent, angle at C (in triangle BCD) corresponds to angle at X (in triangle WXY). Therefore, measure(angle(B,C,D)) = measure(angle(W,X,Y)).

But angle(B,C,D) is angle at C, which corresponds to angle at X. But angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X. Therefore, measure(angle(B,C,D)) = measure(angle(W,X,Y)). Given that angle(W,X,Y) is 77°, then measure(angle(B,C,D)) is also 77°. But according to the problem, measure(angle(B,C,D)) is given as 20x - 4. Therefore:

20x - 4 = 77 → 20x = 81 → x = 81/20 = 4.05. Wait, that contradicts previous result. Hmm. So there's inconsistency here. Which suggests that perhaps my assumption on which angles correspond is wrong?

Wait, maybe I messed up the correspondence of angles. Let me re-examine the congruence. If triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, then the order of vertices is important. So:

Vertex B corresponds to W,

Vertex C corresponds to X,

Vertex D corresponds to Y.

Therefore:

- Angle at B in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY.

- Angle at C in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY.

- Angle at D in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at Y in triangle WXY.

So, angle(C,B,D) is angle at B, which corresponds to angle at W (angle(W,X,Y)? Wait, angle at W in triangle WXY would be angle(W,X,Y)? Or angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X. Wait, angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X. So angle at W in triangle WXY is angle(W,X,Y)? No. Let me clarify:

In triangle WXY, the three angles are:

- At W: angle between W-X and W-Y. So angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X, not W. Wait, confusion arises here.

Let me take it step by step. In triangle WXY, the angles are:

- angle(W,X,Y): this is the angle at X, between points W, X, Y.

- angle(X,W,Y): this is the angle at W, between points X, W, Y.

- angle(W,Y,X): this is the angle at Y, between points W, Y, X.

So, angle(X,W,Y) is angle at W.

Earlier, in the problem, it's stated that measure(angle(X,W,Y)) = 77°, which is angle at W in triangle WXY. Since triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, then angle at B in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. Therefore, measure(angle at B in BCD) = 77°. 

But angle at B in triangle BCD is angle(C,B,D), which was given as 24x + 5. Therefore:

24x + 5 = 77 → 24x = 72 → x = 3. 

But another equation says that measure(angle(B,C,D)) equals measure(angle(W,X,Y)). Let me check what angle(B,C,D) is. Angle(B,C,D) is angle at C in triangle BCD. In triangle WXY, angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X. Since the triangles are congruent, angle at C (from BCD) corresponds to angle at X (from WXY). Therefore, measure(angle(B,C,D)) = measure(angle(W,X,Y)).

But angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X in triangle WXY, which corresponds to angle at C in triangle BCD. So that angle is given as 77°? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y)), 77)" — that is, angle(X,W,Y) is 77°, which is angle at W in triangle WXY. Then, measure(angle(B,C,D)) equals measure(angle(W,X,Y)) — angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY. Wait, no. Wait, the original line says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y)), 77)" — that is, angle(X,W,Y) is 77°, which is the angle at W in triangle WXY. Then, the next line says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)))"

Wait, angle(B,C,D) is angle at C in triangle BCD. The angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY. Since triangles are congruent, angle at C corresponds to angle at X. So measure(angle(B,C,D)) = measure(angle(W,X,Y)).

But angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X, which is part of triangle WXY. But what's its measure? Well, unless given directly, we need to find it using other info. Wait, but maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, let's consider the sum of angles in triangle BCD. The sum of angles in any triangle is 180°. So angle at B (angle(C,B,D)) + angle at C (angle(B,C,D)) + angle at D (angle(B,D,C)) = 180°.

We have expressions for angle(C,B,D) (which is angle at B) as 24x + 5, angle(B,C,D) (angle at C) as 20x - 4, and angle(B,D,C) (angle at D) as equal to angle(W,Y,X) (since angle(B,D,C) corresponds to angle(W,Y,X) due to congruence).

Wait, the problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(W,Y,X)))". So angle(B,D,C) is angle at D in triangle BCD, which corresponds to angle at Y in triangle WXY. Therefore, measure(angle(B,D,C)) equals measure(angle(W,Y,X)).

But angle(W,Y,X) is angle at Y in triangle WXY. But we don't know that directly. However, since the sum of angles in triangle WXY is 180°, we can write:

angle at W (which is angle(X,W,Y)=77°) + angle at X (which is angle(W,X,Y)) + angle at Y (which is angle(W,Y,X)) = 180°.

So:

77° + angle(W,X,Y) + angle(W,Y,X) = 180°.

But angle(W,X,Y) is the same as angle at X in triangle WXY, which is equal to angle(B,C,D) in triangle BCD (as per earlier). And angle(W,Y,X) is equal to angle(B,D,C) in triangle BCD.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables for angles:

Let’s call:

- angle at B in BCD: α = angle(C,B,D) = 24x + 5

- angle at C in BCD: β = angle(B,C,D) = 20x - 4

- angle at D in BCD: γ = angle(B,D,C)

Since the sum of angles is 180°, we have α + β + γ = 180°.

Also, from congruence, angle at W in WXY (which is angle(X,W,Y)) is equal to α, which is 77°, so:

α = 77° => 24x + 5 = 77 ⇒ 24x = 72 ⇒ x = 3.

Then, β = angle at C in BCD is 20x - 4. With x=3, β = 20*3 -4 = 60 -4 = 56°.

Now, angle at X in triangle WXY (which is angle(W,X,Y)) equals angle at C in BCD (β = 56°). Then, angle at Y in triangle WXY (which is angle(W,Y,X)) equals angle at D in BCD (γ). 

Thus, in triangle WXY, angles are:

angle at W: 77°, angle at X: 56°, angle at Y: γ. Their sum must be 180°, so:

77 + 56 + γ = 180 ⇒ 133 + γ = 180 ⇒ γ = 47°.

So angle at D in triangle BCD is 47°, which is γ = 47°. 

But we could also compute γ from the sum of angles in triangle BCD:

α + β + γ = 180 ⇒ 77 + 56 + γ = 180 ⇒ γ = 47°, which matches.

Now, does this give us any new equations involving x? It seems not. So far, the only equation that involved x was from the equality of angles at B and W, leading to x=3. 

However, there's another equation related to the side lengths. Earlier, from BC = WX, we had:

Length of BC = 11, and length of WX = 2x + 5. So 11 = 2x +5 ⇒ 2x = 6 ⇒ x=3. So both equations give x=3. So that seems consistent.

But just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other equations that may involve x. For example, the problem also mentions:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(X,Y)))" and "Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y)))".

So, since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. We already used BC = WX. Now, CD corresponds to XY, so CD = XY. Similarly, BD corresponds to WY.

But do these give us any equations involving x? Not directly, since we aren't given numerical values for these lengths. Unless there's something else.

Wait, but we have the expression for WX as 2x+5, which gave us x=3. Are there other expressions for other sides?

Looking back, the problem has:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), Add(Mul(2,x), 5))" → which is the same as 2x +5.

Other lengths like CD, XY, BD, WY are not given numerically. So unless we can find relations between them through angles or other properties, but since we already solved for x via two different methods (angles and sides), giving x=3, and that's consistent, then x=3 is likely the correct answer.

But let me check once more if there's an alternative approach where x could be different.

Suppose we thought that angle(B,C,D) equals angle(W,X,Y). Wait, earlier I considered that angle(B,C,D) is angle at C in triangle BCD, which corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY. But angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY. So that would imply angle(B,C,D) = angle(W,X,Y). But angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X, which is β = 56° when x=3. But if angle(B,C,D) is supposed to equal angle(W,X,Y), then 20x -4 = 56. Let's check that.

If angle(B,C,D) = angle(W,X,Y):

From earlier, angle(B,C,D) is β = 20x -4. angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY, which is equal to β (as per congruence). Therefore, β = 20x -4 = angle(W,X,Y). But angle(W,X,Y) is part of triangle WXY, whose angles are 77°, angle at X (β), and angle at Y (γ). Summing to 180°, as above.

But if we assume that angle(W,X,Y) is 77°, then that would conflict with β being 56°, but that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY. Previously, we said that angle at X in triangle WXY is equal to angle at C in triangle BCD (β). So β = angle(W,X,Y). But angle(W,X,Y) isn't given directly; instead, angle(X,W,Y) is given as 77°, which is angle at W. 

So angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X, which is β = 20x -4. But from triangle WXY, angles are 77° (at W), β (at X), and γ (at Y). So 77 + β + γ = 180. And from triangle BCD, angles are α=77°, β=20x-4, γ=... which we found as 47° when x=3. So substituting x=3 into β gives β=56°, and then 77 + 56 + γ = 180 → γ=47°. 

But if we were to use another equation, say, angle(B,D,C) equals angle(W,Y,X). Angle(B,D,C) is γ=47°, and angle(W,Y,X) is the angle at Y in triangle WXY, which is the third angle. So angle(W,Y,X) = γ = 47°, which is consistent. 

Therefore, all equations are satisfied with x=3. Hence, the answer should be B. 3.

But just to confirm, let me check if there's any possibility that another equation could lead to a different x. For example, suppose someone mistakenly equates angle(B,C,D) to angle(X,W,Y), which is 77°, leading to 20x-4=77. But that would be incorrect, because angle(B,C,D) corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY, not angle at W. However, if someone made that mistake, they'd get x=(77+4)/20=81/20=4.05, which is not among the options except possibly C (4), but since 4.05 is closer to 4 than 5, but the correct answer is 3. So that's why it's important to correctly identify the correspondence of angles.

Therefore, the correct value is x=3, which is option B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we analyze the geometric relationships and constraints provided in the problem. Two triangles, $ \triangle BCD $ and $ \triangle WXY $, are given to be **congruent**. Congruence implies that all corresponding sides and angles are equal. Additionally, specific algebraic expressions and numerical values are associated with the lengths and angles of these triangles.

---

### Step 1: Use Side Congruence

From the congruence of the triangles:

$$
\text{Length}(BC) = \text{Length}(WX)
$$

We're told:

- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 11 $
- $ \text{Length}(WX) = 2x + 5 $

Setting these equal:

$$
11 = 2x + 5
$$

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

$$
2x = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
$$

This gives us our first candidate value for $ x $. However, we will verify consistency across multiple angle conditions.

---

### Step 2: Use Angle Congruence

The congruence of triangles also ensures that all corresponding angles are equal. Specifically:

- $ \angle(C, B, D) = \angle(X, W, Y) = 77^\circ $
- $ \angle(B, C, D) = \angle(W, X, Y) $
- $ \angle(B, D, C) = \angle(W, Y, X) $

We are given:

- $ \angle(C, B, D) = 24x + 5 $
- $ \angle(B, C, D) = 20x - 4 $
- $ \angle(X, W, Y) = 77^\circ $

Using the first congruence:

$$
\angle(C, B, D) = \angle(X, W, Y) \Rightarrow 24x + 5 = 77
$$

Solving:

$$
24x = 72 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
$$

Again, this confirms $ x = 3 $.

---

### Step 3: Verify Consistency with Triangle Angle Sum

Let’s ensure that all angles add up correctly in triangle $ \triangle BCD $:

- $ \angle(C, B, D) = 24x + 5 = 77^\circ $ (already verified)
- $ \angle(B, C, D) = 20x - 4 = 20(3) - 4 = 56^\circ $
- $ \angle(B, D, C) = ? $

Sum of angles in a triangle must be $ 180^\circ $, so:

$$
\angle(C, B, D) + \angle(B, C, D) + \angle(B, D, C) = 180^\circ
$$

$$
77 + 56 + \angle(B, D, C) = 180 \Rightarrow \angle(B, D, C) = 47^\circ
$$

Since $ \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY $, the corresponding angles in triangle $ \triangle WXY $ must match:

- $ \angle(X, W, Y) = 77^\circ $
- $ \angle(W, X, Y) = 56^\circ $
- $ \angle(W, Y, X) = 47^\circ $

These match perfectly with the computed angles in $ \triangle BCD $, confirming consistency.

---

### Final Conclusion

All constraints—both side-lengths and angle measures—are satisfied when $ x = 3 $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
