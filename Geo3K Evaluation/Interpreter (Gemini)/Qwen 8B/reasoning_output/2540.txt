MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 3 here. The problem gives several points and lines with some angles specified. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, there are points A, B, C, D, E, F. Then there are lines AD, AE, BC, BF. Angles labeled 1 through 8, with specific measures mentioned. Also, some perpendicularity conditions and right angles. 

The key thing is that AB is perpendicular to BC. So line AB is perpendicular to line BC. That means angle at point B between AB and BC is 90 degrees. Wait, but there's also a mention of Angle(5) being a right angle (90 degrees). Maybe that's referring to the same angle?

Let me parse the constraints again:

- MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 36. Hmm, angle D? Not sure which angle that refers to yet. Maybe angle at point D? But need to check context.

Then:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180 minus 104, so 76 degrees. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(3)) equals 180 minus 104, which would also be 76 degrees. Wait, but the question asks for angle 3, so maybe that's directly given as 76? But then why is that an option here? Wait, looking at the answer choices, 76 is option D. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "Find the measure of ∠3 if AB ⊥ BC." But in the given constraints, they have MeasureOf(Angle(3)) equals Sub(180,104), which is 76. So that seems straightforward. However, perhaps there's more to it because maybe angle 3 isn't directly given? Or maybe there's some confusion about which angle is referred to as angle 3?

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement carefully.

Given:

- MeasureOf(Angle(1)) Equals(Sub(180,104))) → 76°
- MeasureOf(Angle(3)) Equals(Sub(180,104))) → Also 76°
But then there's another constraint: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DFB)), 104). So angle DFB is 104°, and angle EFC is 40°, and angle 5 is 90°, which is a right angle. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)), meaning AB ⊥ BC. 

So maybe angle 3 is related to these other angles? Wait, but according to the given constraints, angle 3 is set to 180 - 104 = 76°, which would make it 76°, which is option D. But the problem might be expecting us to calculate it based on other elements rather than taking it as given? Because maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the user wrote:

"MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Sub(180,104)))"

Similarly for angle 3. So they are setting angle 1 and angle 3 each equal to 180 - 104 = 76°. Therefore, angle 3 is 76°, which is option D. But the problem says "if AB ⊥ BC", which is already given as part of the constraints. So why is this a question? Unless there's something wrong with my understanding of how the angles are defined.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is not directly given, but we need to compute it using other information. For example, maybe angle 3 is part of triangle DFB or EFC, and we need to find it via triangle properties.

Wait, let's consider the diagram. Points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines AD, AE, BC, BF. So, perhaps ABC is a triangle? Since AB is perpendicular to BC, making triangle ABC a right triangle at B. Then, points D and E are connected to A, and F is connected to B. Also, angles DFB is 104°, angle EFC is 40°, angle 5 is 90°, etc.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's assume ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. So AB ⊥ BC. Now, points D and E are somewhere such that AD and AE are lines from A. Point F is connected to B and C (since line BF exists). 

Now, angle DFB is 104°, which is at point F, between DF and BF. And angle EFC is 40°, which is at point F between EF and CF. Also, angle 5 is a right angle. Maybe angle 5 is the right angle at B? But since AB ⊥ BC, angle at B is 90°, so that could be angle 5. 

If angle 5 is 90°, then maybe angle 5 refers to angle at B. Then, other angles like angle DFB (at F) is 104°, and angle EFC (at F) is 40°. Let me see if those angles relate to other parts of the diagram.

Also, angle D is mentioned as having measure 36°. Wait, MeasureOf(Angle(D)) is 36. If angle D refers to angle at D, perhaps in triangle DFB or something else. 

But without seeing the exact diagram, it's challenging. However, the problem states that angle 3 is equal to 180 - 104 = 76°, so unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be 76°, which is option D. But maybe the problem is designed to trick us into thinking that angle 3 is 76°, but actually requires computation.

Wait, but the problem says "Find the measure of ∠3 if AB ⊥ BC". But AB ⊥ BC is already given as part of the constraints. So maybe angle 3 is not directly given, but derived from other angles. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps angle 3 is referring to angle at point C? Or another angle. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving angle 3 where we need to apply triangle angle sum or exterior angles.

For instance, suppose angle DFB is 104°, and angle EFC is 40°. If points D, E, F are arranged around point F, then maybe considering triangle DFE or something similar. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is an external angle to a triangle.

Alternatively, considering that angle D is 36°, angle DFB is 104°, and angle EFC is 40°, perhaps there's a way to relate them.

Alternatively, since angle 5 is a right angle (90°), and AB ⊥ BC, which is the same as angle at B being 90°, which is angle 5. Then, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by transversals or something else.

Wait, the problem mentions angles 1 through 8. Let me list all the given angle measures:

- MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 36°
- MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 - 104 = 76°
- MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 180 - 104 = 76°
- MeasureOf(Angle(7)) = 180 - 40 = 140°
- MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 90°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DFB)), 104°)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(EFC)), 40°)

So, angle DFB is 104°, angle EFC is 40°, angle 5 is 90°, angle 1 and 3 are 76°, angle 7 is 140°, and angle D is 36°.

But the question is asking for the measure of angle 3, which is stated as 76°, so why is this a question? It seems like it's directly given. However, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. For example, maybe angle 3 isn't directly given, but needs to be computed based on other elements. 

Wait, but according to the given constraints, MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is set to 180 - 104, which is 76°, so that's direct. So the answer would be 76°, which is option D. But let me check if there's any possibility that angle 3 is different.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to a different angle. For example, if angle 3 is an angle in triangle DFB or EFC. Let's explore that possibility.

Suppose angle DFB is 104°, which is at point F. If we look at triangle DFB, the angles would be at D, F, and B. We know angle at F is 104°, and angle at D is 36°, as per MeasureOf(Angle(D))=36. So in triangle DFB, angles at D and F are known. So angle at B would be 180 - 104 - 36 = 40°. So angle at B in triangle DFB is 40°. 

But earlier, we had AB ⊥ BC, making angle at B (between AB and BC) as 90°. So if angle at B in triangle DFB is 40°, that suggests that line FB makes an angle of 40° with BD or something else. But perhaps angle 3 is referring to that angle at B in triangle DFB? But that would be 40°, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is referring to another angle.

Wait, but the problem has multiple angles labeled 1 through 8. The given constraints include MeasureOf(Angle(3)) equals 180 - 104, which is 76°, so that's directly given. Hence, regardless of other elements, angle 3 is 76°, hence answer D. 

However, the presence of angle DFB being 104° and angle EFC being 40° may suggest that angle 3 is part of another calculation. For example, if angle 3 is supplementary to 104°, but no, 180-104 is 76. Alternatively, if there's a triangle where angle 3 is an exterior angle. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is referring to angle at point C. Let me think. Suppose ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. Let me imagine coordinates. Let’s assign coordinates for clarity. Let me place point B at origin (0,0), since AB is perpendicular to BC. Let's say AB is vertical and BC is horizontal. So point B is (0,0), point A is (0,a) for some a, and point C is (c,0) for some c. Then, lines AD and AE go from A to points D and E. Line BF connects B to F, which might be somewhere. 

But without knowing where D, E, F are, it's hard to tell. However, angle DFB is 104°, angle EFC is 40°, and angle D is 36°. If angle D is at point D, then maybe triangle DFB has angles 36°, 104°, and 40°, as previously thought. 

But if angle 3 is referring to that 40° angle, then it would be different. However, the problem specifically says that MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is 180-104=76°, so that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and angle 3 is supposed to be related to angle D or something else. But given the constraints as written, angle 3 is explicitly given as 76°, so I think the answer should be D. 

But the problem is presented as a question, implying that we need to derive it, not take it as given. This suggests that perhaps I misread the constraints. Let me recheck:

Original problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Sub(180,104)))

MeasureOf(Angle(3)), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), Sub(180,104)))

This implies that both angles 1 and 3 are set to 180-104=76°. But why would angle 3 be set this way? Perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are vertically opposite angles, or corresponding angles, or something else. 

Alternatively, angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by intersecting lines, and their measures are determined by subtraction. 

But if that's the case, then the answer for angle 3 is indeed 76°, which is option D. 

But to ensure correctness, maybe there's a scenario where angle 3 is not directly given but depends on other factors. For example, if angle 3 is an exterior angle to a triangle, then it would be equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is related to angle DFB and angle EFC. Let's consider:

If angle DFB is 104°, and angle EFC is 40°, and angle 5 is 90°, then perhaps there's a quadrilateral involved. For example, if points D, E, F, and another point form a quadrilateral with angles adding up to 360°. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle EFC, which has angle at F of 40°, and maybe angle at C is something. But again, without knowing the full structure, it's ambiguous. 

Given the ambiguity, but the explicit constraint that MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is 180-104, which is 76°, I think the intended answer is D. Therefore, Final Answer: D.
