====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pentagon U, V, W, Y, Z. The question asks for the measure of angle W, which I assume refers to angle at point W, so that would be angle VWY? Wait, no. Let me check the angles mentioned. The angles given are:

- Angle(V,U,Z): That's angle at U between V and Z.
- Angle(U,V,W): Angle at V between U and W.
- Angle(V,W,Y): Angle at W between V and Y.
- Angle(W,Y,Z): Angle at Y between W and Z.
- Angle(Y,Z,U): Angle at Z between Y and U.

Wait, but the pentagon has five vertices, so each vertex has an internal angle. But here they're giving specific angles. However, since it's a pentagon, the sum of the internal angles should be (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. Which matches the last equation given: Sum of all those angles equals 540. So that checks out.

The problem gives equations involving variables. Let me parse the equations again:

First, the measures of each angle are expressed in terms of x. Let me note them down:

1. Measure of angle(V,U,Z) = Sub(x,8). So that's x - 8 degrees?
Wait, Sub(x,8) probably means subtraction, so x minus 8.

2. Measure of angle(U,V,W) = Sub(Mul(3,x),11). So 3x - 11.

3. Measure of angle(V,W,Y) = Add(x,8). So x + 8.

4. Measure of angle(Y,Z,U) = Add(Mul(2,x),7). So 2x + 7.

5. Measure of angle(W,Y,Z) = x.

Then the sum of these five angles equals 540. So adding them up:

(x - 8) + (3x - 11) + (x + 8) + (2x + 7) + x = 540.

Let me compute that step by step.

Combine like terms:

First, expand all terms:

Term1: x - 8

Term2: 3x - 11

Term3: x + 8

Term4: 2x + 7

Term5: x

Adding all together:

x -8 + 3x -11 + x +8 + 2x +7 +x.

Now combine x terms:

x + 3x + x + 2x + x = (1+3+1+2+1)x = 8x.

Constant terms:

-8 -11 +8 +7.

Compute constants:

Start with -8 -11 = -19; then +8 gives -11; then +7 gives -4.

So total sum is 8x - 4 = 540.

Thus:

8x -4 = 540 → 8x = 544 → x = 544 / 8 = 68.

So x is 68 degrees.

Now, the question is asking for m∠W. Wait, angle W in the pentagon. Which angle corresponds to angle at point W?

Looking back at the angles listed:

The angles given are:

Angle(V,U,Z) – angle at U.

Angle(U,V,W) – angle at V.

Angle(V,W,Y) – angle at W. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at W is angle V-W-Y, which is angle(V,W,Y). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the fifth angle is angle(W,Y,Z), which is at Y. And the fourth angle is angle(Y,Z,U) at Z. Then the third angle is angle(V,W,Y) at W. Therefore, angle at W is angle(V,W,Y), which is given as x + 8. Since x=68, that would be 68 + 8 = 76 degrees. But wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says "Find m∠W", which is angle at W. But according to the given angles, angle(V,W,Y) is at W. So that's the angle at W. So substituting x=68 into that expression: x +8 = 68 +8 = 76. So answer would be 76, which is option C. But let me double-check everything because sometimes there might be confusion about which angle is which.

Wait, but let me make sure. The pentagon is labeled U, V, W, Y, Z. So the order of the vertices is U connected to V, V connected to W, W connected to Y, Y connected to Z, Z connected to U. So the internal angles are at each vertex:

At U: between Z and V (since the edges are Z-U and U-V).

At V: between U and W.

At W: between V and Y.

At Y: between W and Z.

At Z: between Y and U.

Therefore, the internal angles are:

Angle at U: ∠ZUV (but the first angle given is ∠VUZ, which is same as ∠ZUV, so that's angle at U.

Similarly, angle at V is ∠UVW.

Angle at W is ∠VWY.

Angle at Y is ∠WYZ.

Angle at Z is ∠YZU.

Therefore, the measure of angle at W is ∠VWY, which is given as angle(V,W,Y) which was defined as x +8. Therefore, when x=68, that's 76 degrees. Hence, answer C. But let me check again if there's any mistake in calculation.

Calculating x:

Equation: 8x -4 = 540 → 8x = 544 → x=68. Correct.

Then angle at W: x +8 = 68 +8=76. So answer is 76, which is option C. But looking at the answer choices, option C is 76. However, the user lists two options as B.38 and C.76. Wait, original answer choices:

A. 38

B. 38

C. 76

D. 152

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the answer choices? Or perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which angle is at W. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, could the question be referring to another angle? For example, angle W could refer to angle at W, but maybe in some other way. Wait, let me think again. The problem says "Find m∠W". In standard notation, ∠W would mean the angle at point W, which is indeed the internal angle of the pentagon at vertex W. So that's ∠VWY, which is angle(V,W,Y). Which is equal to x +8. So with x=68, that's 76. Therefore, answer is C. So unless there's a miscalculation.

But let me verify once more the sum of angles:

Original equation:

Sum = (x-8)+(3x-11)+(x+8)+(2x+7)+x = ?

Expand:

x -8 +3x -11 +x +8 +2x +7 +x

Combine x terms:

x +3x +x +2x +x = 8x

Constants: -8 -11 +8 +7 = (-8 -11) + (8 +7) = (-19) + 15 = -4. Yes.

So 8x -4 = 540 → 8x=544 → x=68. Correct.

So angle at W is x +8 = 76. So answer is C. But let me check if there's another possible interpretation.

Another possibility: Maybe the problem refers to angle W as something else? Like, maybe the angle at W is different? For instance, maybe the problem uses a different notation. Wait, the problem defines:

Angle(V,U,Z) – which is angle at U.

Angle(U,V,W) – angle at V.

Angle(V,W,Y) – angle at W.

Angle(W,Y,Z) – angle at Y.

Angle(Y,Z,U) – angle at Z.

Yes, that seems right. So angle at W is indeed angle(V,W,Y), which is x +8. So 68+8=76. So answer is C.

But looking at the answer choices, both A and B are 38, C is 76, D is 152. So 76 is option C. Therefore, the answer is C. So Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle W $ in the pentagon $ UVWYZ $, we start by analyzing the given geometric constraints and using algebraic reasoning based on the sum of interior angles in a polygon.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Given Angles**

We are told the pentagon has vertices $ U, V, W, Y, Z $. Each vertex forms an internal angle. The problem provides expressions for each of these angles in terms of a variable $ x $:

1. $ \angle(V,U,Z) = x - 8 $
2. $ \angle(U,V,W) = 3x - 11 $
3. $ \angle(V,W,Y) = x + 8 $
4. $ \angle(Y,Z,U) = 2x + 7 $
5. $ \angle(W,Y,Z) = x $

These five angles correspond to the internal angles at points $ U, V, W, Y, Z $ respectively.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**

For any pentagon, the sum of its interior angles is always:

$$
(5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
$$

This is confirmed by the final constraint:

$$
\text{Sum} = (x - 8) + (3x - 11) + (x + 8) + (2x + 7) + x = 540
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve the Equation**

Add all the terms:

- Combine $ x $-terms:  
  $ x + 3x + x + 2x + x = 8x $

- Combine constant terms:  
  $ -8 - 11 + 8 + 7 = -4 $

So,

$$
8x - 4 = 540
$$

$$
8x = 544 \Rightarrow x = \frac{544}{8} = 68
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find the Measure of $ \angle W $**

From earlier, the internal angle at point $ W $ is:

$$
\angle(V,W,Y) = x + 8
$$

Substitute $ x = 68 $:

$$
\angle(V,W,Y) = 68 + 8 = 76^\circ
$$

Thus, the measure of $ \angle W $ is $ 76^\circ $.

---

### **Final Answer**
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

**Final Answer: C**
