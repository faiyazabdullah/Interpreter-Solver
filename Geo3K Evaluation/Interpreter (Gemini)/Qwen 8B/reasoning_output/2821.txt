MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD that's a rhombus. The question is asking for the length of CD, given that AB is 2x + 3 and BC is x + 7. 

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. That's one of the key properties. So, if it's a rhombus, then AB should be equal to BC, which should be equal to CD, and so on. Wait, but the problem also mentions several equations between the lengths of the sides. Let me check those again.

The constraints say that AB equals BC, AB equals CD, AB equals DA, BC equals CD, BC equals DA, and CD equals DA. So essentially, all four sides are equal because they're connected through these equalities. Therefore, since AB equals BC, and BC equals CD, etc., all sides are equal. 

So, given that AB = 2x + 3 and BC = x + 7, and since AB equals BC (as per the constraints), we can set them equal to each other. Let me write that equation:

AB = BC  
=> 2x + 3 = x + 7  

Now, solving for x. Subtract x from both sides:

2x - x + 3 = 7  
x + 3 = 7  
Subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 7 - 3  
x = 4  

Alright, so x is 4. Now, we need to find CD. But since it's a rhombus, CD should be equal to AB, BC, etc. So once we find AB or BC, that would give us CD directly. 

Let me compute AB first using x=4. AB = 2x + 3. Plugging in x=4:

AB = 2*(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11. 

Alternatively, checking BC: BC = x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Yep, same value. Since all sides are equal, CD must also be 11. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 11. So the answer should be B. 

Wait, let me double-check if there's anything else. The problem says that CD is equal to DA as well, and all sides are equal. So yes, CD is equal to AB, which is 11. Therefore, the answer is B. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The steps make sense: equate AB and BC to find x, substitute back to get the side length, and since CD is equal to all others, that's the answer. The answer choices include B as 11, so that's correct.
