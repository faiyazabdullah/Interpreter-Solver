MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with some angles mentioned. The question is asking for the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. Let me start by trying to visualize or sketch the diagram based on the given information.

First, the points and lines:

- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W.
- Lines: WB, AT, CJ, IN.
- Angles 1 through 8, with measures given for angles 1 and 3. Angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°.

Constraints include parallel lines: WB || AT. Also, various points lying on these lines. There are intersections at certain points like S (intersection of WB, CJ, IN) and R (intersection of AT, CJ, IN), etc. Also, there are multiple intersection points like F, G, S, R, P.

Hmm, since WB is parallel to AT, maybe there's some transversal lines creating corresponding angles or alternate interior angles? But first, I need to figure out how the lines intersect and form the angles mentioned.

Let me note down the key intersections:

- Line WB intersects with CJ and IN at point S and another point? Wait, according to the IntersectAt statements:

IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)) – so line WB intersects with both CJ and IN at point S? That can't be unless all three lines meet at S. Similarly, IntersectAt(Line(A,T), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(R)) means lines AT, CJ, IN all meet at R. Then, IntersectAt(Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Line(W,B), Point(F)) – so lines CJ, IN, WB meet at F? Wait, but earlier it said that WB and CJ intersect at S? Maybe there's confusion here. Wait, perhaps each IntersectAt statement refers to two lines intersecting at a point, but maybe the third line also passes through that same point?

Wait, the way it's written: IntersectAt(Line(X,Y), Line(Z,W), Line(A,B), Point(P)) – does that mean that all three lines X,Y; Z,W; A,B intersect at P? Or is it that Line(X,Y) and Line(Z,W) intersect at P, and then Line(A,B) also passes through P? Probably the latter. So for example, the first one says Line(W,B) intersects with Line(C,J) and Line(I,N) at Point(S). So that would imply that all three lines WB, CJ, IN pass through point S. Similarly, Line(A,T) intersects with Line(C,J) and Line(I,N) at R, meaning lines AT, CJ, IN meet at R. Then, Line(C,J) intersects with Line(I,N) and Line(W,B) at F. So lines CJ, IN, WB meet at F. Similarly, Line(C,J) intersects with Line(I,N) and Line(A,T) at G. And finally, Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Line(W,B) intersect at P. Wait, but earlier they had intersections at S, R, F, G, P. This seems conflicting unless there are multiple intersection points. Maybe there's some overlapping?

This might be a complex diagram with multiple concurrent lines. Since WB || AT, which suggests that lines WB and AT are parallel, so they don't intersect unless extended. However, the lines CJ, IN, etc., may cross them.

But given that there are multiple intersections, maybe forming a network of lines with various angles. Now, angles 1, 3, etc., are formed at these intersections. The question is about angle 6. Let me think about how the angles relate.

Given that angle 1 is 50° and angle 3 is 60°, need to find angle 6.

Since the problem involves parallel lines and transversals, maybe using properties of parallel lines, such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, consecutive interior angles, etc. Also, triangle angle sums, vertical angles, supplementary angles, etc.

But without seeing the exact diagram, I need to reconstruct based on the given constraints.

Let me try to outline the structure:

Lines WB and AT are parallel. Let me assume that WB and AT are horizontal for simplicity. Then, lines CJ and IN are transversals crossing them. Also, lines CJ and IN intersect each other at some points, possibly forming triangles or other polygons.

The points S, R, F, G, P are intersection points between different lines. For instance:

- S is the intersection of WB, CJ, and IN. So all three lines meet at S. Therefore, S is a common point where WB, CJ, IN meet. Similarly, R is where AT, CJ, IN meet. So lines AT, CJ, IN meet at R. Then F is where CJ, IN, WB meet? Wait, but S was already the intersection of WB, CJ, IN. So maybe there's a mistake here? Unless there are multiple intersection points. Alternatively, maybe the wording is that each pair of lines intersects at those points. For example, the first IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)) could mean that Line(W,B) intersects Line(C,J) at S, and Line(I,N) also passes through S. Similarly, Line(C,J) intersects Line(I,N) at S, and Line(W,B) also passes through S. So S is the common intersection point of all three lines WB, CJ, IN.

Similarly, R is where AT, CJ, IN meet. So lines AT, CJ, IN meet at R. Then, F is where CJ, IN, WB meet? But S is already where WB, CJ, IN meet. So F would be the same as S? But the problem lists different points, so perhaps there's more than one intersection point. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the labels are different because the lines intersect in different places. Wait, perhaps each IntersectAt statement refers to two lines intersecting at a particular point. Like:

- Line(W,B) and Line(C,J) intersect at S.
- Line(W,B) and Line(I,N) intersect at S?
No, that would make S the intersection of WB with both CJ and IN, implying that all three lines meet at S. Then similarly, Line(A,T) and Line(C,J) intersect at R, and Line(A,T) and Line(I,N) intersect at R, making R the intersection of AT, CJ, IN. Similarly, Line(C,J) and Line(I,N) intersect at F, and Line(C,J) and Line(W,B) intersect at F? Which would be same as S? But then F and S would be same point. But in the problem, they mention different points: F, G, S, R, P. So maybe each IntersectAt refers to two lines intersecting at that point, and the third line passing through it? For example, IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)) could mean that Line(W,B) and Line(C,J) intersect at S, and Line(I,N) also passes through S. So S is on all three lines. Similarly, R is the intersection of AT and CJ, and also IN passes through R. Then, F is the intersection of CJ and IN, and WB passes through F. Wait, but that would again suggest that S and F are the same point. But maybe there are multiple intersection points? Or perhaps the lines are arranged in such a way that each pair intersects at different points? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each IntersectAt statement is referring to three lines intersecting at one point. For example, WB, CJ, IN all meet at S. Then, AT, CJ, IN meet at R. Then, CJ, IN, WB meet at F (which would be same as S?), but maybe there's a typo. This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should focus on the angles given and their relationships.

We know angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, need to find angle 6. Let me think about possible configurations.

Assuming that lines WB and AT are parallel. Suppose that lines CJ and IN are two transversals cutting across them. If lines CJ and IN intersect each other, forming a sort of 'X' shape. The points S and R are where these lines intersect the parallel lines.

For example, suppose that line CJ crosses WB at S and AT at R. Similarly, line IN crosses WB at S and AT at R? Wait, no, because if WB and AT are parallel, then a transversal like CJ would cross them at different points. So if CJ crosses WB at S and AT at R. Similarly, IN crosses WB at S and AT at R? No, that would mean that both CJ and IN cross WB at S, which would mean that S is the intersection of WB with both CJ and IN. So lines CJ and IN both pass through S. But then, if they are both passing through S, they would intersect at S. So that makes sense. So S is the intersection point of lines CJ, IN, and WB. Similarly, R is the intersection of lines CJ, IN, and AT. So lines CJ and IN cross WB at S and AT at R. Thus, lines CJ and IN are two transversals intersecting the parallel lines WB and AT.

Now, considering the angles formed by these intersections. Let's consider the angles around point S and R.

At point S, which is the intersection of WB, CJ, and IN. So, lines WB, CJ, and IN meet at S. Therefore, there are angles formed here. Similarly, at point R, lines AT, CJ, and IN meet. 

But the angles mentioned are 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 8. Given that angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, need to find angle 6.

Perhaps angle 1 is one of the angles formed at point S or R, and angle 3 is another. Let me try to imagine.

If WB || AT, then the angles formed by the transversals CJ and IN would create corresponding angles. For example, if CJ is a transversal crossing WB and AT, then the angles formed on the same side would be equal. Similarly for IN.

But since CJ and IN are both transversals, maybe creating a series of angles. Also, the intersection points S and R would have vertical angles, and supplementary angles.

But without knowing exactly where angles 1, 3, and 6 are located, it's challenging. However, maybe we can use the given measures to deduce relations.

Suppose angle 1 is at point S, and angle 3 is at point R. Let's assume that angle 1 is formed by the intersection of WB and CJ at S. Since WB is parallel to AT, the corresponding angle at R (on AT) would be equal. But angle 3 is 60°, which could be part of that relationship.

Alternatively, angle 1 could be an angle inside a triangle formed by the intersections. Let me think of a scenario where multiple triangles are formed by the intersecting lines, leading to various angles.

Another approach: Since WB || AT, and lines CJ and IN are transversals, the sum of angles on a straight line would be 180°, and corresponding angles would be equal.

Let me try to label the angles. Let's say at point S, where lines WB, CJ, and IN meet. So, line CJ passes through S, and line IN also passes through S. Therefore, at point S, there are angles between WB and CJ, between CJ and IN, between IN and WB, etc.

Similarly, at point R, where lines AT, CJ, and IN meet, similar angles exist.

But how do angles 1, 3, and 6 come into play?

Maybe angle 1 is an angle between WB and CJ at point S, and angle 3 is an angle between CJ and IN at point S. Then, using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or using triangle properties.

Alternatively, since WB || AT, and CJ is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Suppose angle 1 is at point S between WB and CJ, and its corresponding angle at point R (between AT and CJ) would be equal. If angle 3 is another angle related to this configuration.

Wait, but angle 3 is given as 60°. Let me think step by step.

Let me consider the intersection at point S. At S, lines WB, CJ, and IN meet. Let's assume that line CJ forms an angle with WB. Let's call that angle 1, which is 50°. Then, since WB || AT, the corresponding angle at point R (where CJ meets AT) would also be 50°. But angle 3 is given as 60°, which could be another angle at point R.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is formed by the intersection of lines IN and AT. If IN is a transversal, then the angle between IN and AT could be related to angle 1 via supplementary angles.

Alternatively, considering triangle formed by points S, R, and others. For instance, if there's a triangle involving points S, R, and another intersection, then using the sum of angles in a triangle.

But I need more concrete steps. Let's try to assign variables to unknown angles.

Let me denote:

At point S, where lines WB, CJ, IN meet. Let's say that the angle between WB and CJ is angle 1 = 50°. Then, the angle between CJ and IN at point S would be something else. Let's call that angle x. Then, the remaining angle between IN and WB at point S would be y. Since the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but actually, when three lines meet at a point, the sum of the angles around that point would be 360°. But if we're talking about angles formed by two lines intersecting, but with a third line passing through, it gets complicated.

Alternatively, if we look at the angles formed by two lines intersecting. For instance, if two lines intersect, they form two pairs of opposite angles. But when a third line passes through, it creates additional angles.

Wait, maybe focusing on specific angles. Let's suppose that at point S, line CJ crosses WB and IN. So, the angle between WB and CJ is 50°, which is angle 1. Then, the angle between CJ and IN at point S would depend on the slope of IN relative to CJ.

But since WB || AT, and if IN is another transversal, then the angle between IN and WB would correspond to the angle between IN and AT. Suppose that angle between IN and WB is z, then the angle between IN and AT would also be z due to parallel lines.

However, without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. Let's think about triangle formed by points S, R, and maybe another point. For example, if lines CJ and IN intersect at S and R, but wait, earlier we thought that lines CJ and IN intersect at S (since WB, CJ, IN meet at S). So lines CJ and IN intersect at S, hence forming vertical angles there. Then, if they also intersect at R? That would mean that lines CJ and IN are the same line, which contradicts. So that can't be. Hence, my previous assumption must be wrong.

Therefore, the IntersectAt statements likely indicate that each pair of lines intersects at specified points. For example:

- Line(W,B) and Line(C,J) intersect at S.
- Line(W,B) and Line(I,N) intersect at S.
Thus, S is the intersection point of WB with both CJ and IN. So lines CJ and IN both pass through S. Therefore, lines CJ and IN intersect at S. Similarly, Line(A,T) and Line(C,J) intersect at R, and Line(A,T) and Line(I,N) intersect at R, so R is the intersection of AT with both CJ and IN. Therefore, lines CJ and IN intersect AT at R. Therefore, lines CJ and IN are two lines that intersect both WB and AT, creating a sort of grid.

So, lines CJ and IN are two lines that intersect both the parallel lines WB and AT. So, CJ and IN are two transversals crossing the parallel lines WB and AT. Their intersection points are S (for WB) and R (for AT).

Additionally, there's an intersection at F where CJ and IN meet? Wait, no, if CJ and IN intersect at S (from WB) and also at R (from AT)? That would only happen if CJ and IN are the same line, which isn't the case. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Hence, my interpretation must be incorrect.

Alternative interpretation: Each IntersectAt statement specifies that two lines intersect at a particular point, and the third line also passes through that point. For example:

IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)) means that Line(W,B) intersects Line(C,J) at S, and Line(I,N) also passes through S. So, S is on all three lines: WB, CJ, and IN. Similarly, IntersectAt(Line(A,T), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(R)) means that Line(AT) intersects Line(CJ) at R, and Line(IN) also passes through R. So R is on all three lines: AT, CJ, and IN. Then, IntersectAt(Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Line(W,B), Point(F)) means that Line(CJ) intersects Line(IN) at F, and Line(W,B) also passes through F. So F is on all three lines: CJ, IN, and WB. But earlier, S is also on all three lines WB, CJ, IN, so F would be the same as S. But the problem mentions different points: S, R, F, G, P. Therefore, this suggests that there are multiple intersection points. So, perhaps the lines intersect in multiple places?

Wait, maybe the lines are not just two transversals but more. For example, Line(CJ) intersects Line(WB) at S and Line(IN) at F. Line(IN) intersects Line(WB) at S and Line(AT) at R. Line(CJ) intersects Line(AT) at R and Line(IN) at F. This would require that Line(CJ) and Line(IN) intersect at both F and R, which implies that F and R are the same point. Hence, contradiction again.

This suggests that there's either a misinterpretation of the constraints, or the diagram has special properties. Let me try a different approach, focusing on the angles.

Given that angle 1 = 50°, angle 3 = 60°, need to find angle 6. Let me consider that angles 1 and 3 are related through the parallel lines and transversals.

Assume that angle 1 is an angle formed by a transversal with the parallel lines. For example, if angle 1 is at the intersection of WB and CJ, then its corresponding angle on AT would be equal. If angle 3 is another angle formed by the same transversal or another transversal, then we can use that.

Suppose angle 1 is between WB and CJ at point S, which is 50°. Because WB || AT, the corresponding angle at the intersection of CJ and AT would also be 50°. Let's call that angle 2. Then, if angle 3 is adjacent to this, forming a linear pair, then angle 3 could be supplementary to angle 2, making it 180° - 50° = 130°, but angle 3 is given as 60°, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, angle 3 could be an alternate interior angle, but that depends on the transversal.

Alternatively, if angle 3 is formed by the intersection of IN with AT or WB. Suppose that angle 3 is at the intersection of IN and AT, which is 60°. Since IN is a transversal, and if it forms an angle of 60° with AT, then the corresponding angle on WB would also be 60°, assuming parallel lines.

Now, if we consider the angles around point S (intersection of WB, CJ, IN), the angles formed there would include angle 1 (say, between WB and CJ), angle between CJ and IN, and angle between IN and WB. These angles would add up to 360° if they are around the point, but if considering the angles formed by two lines intersecting, it's 180°, but with a third line passing through, it complicates things.

Alternatively, considering triangle formed by points S, R, and another point. Suppose that lines CJ and IN intersect at S and R, but that's impossible unless they are the same line. So, perhaps the angles at S and R are related through the parallel lines.

Let me try to think of this as two transversals (CJ and IN) crossing two parallel lines (WB and AT). This setup usually creates a series of angles that can be related through parallel lines.

For example, if CJ crosses WB and AT, creating angles. Similarly, IN crosses WB and AT, creating other angles. The intersection of CJ and IN would form a triangle or quadrilateral, and the angles within that would relate to the given values.

Assume that at the intersection of CJ and IN, there are angles. Suppose angle 1 is at the intersection of WB and CJ (50°), angle 3 is at the intersection of IN and AT (60°). Then, using the properties of parallel lines, we can find other angles.

Alternatively, using the concept of vertically opposite angles, corresponding angles, and supplementary angles.

Let me draw a rough mental picture:

- Two horizontal parallel lines WB and AT.
- Transversal CJ goes from left to right, intersecting WB at S and AT at R.
- Another transversal IN goes from left to right, intersecting WB at S and AT at R. Wait, but this would mean that CJ and IN are the same line, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that CJ and IN are two different transversals intersecting WB and AT at different points.

Wait, but the constraint says that lines WB and AT are parallel, and lines CJ and IN are transversals. So, CJ crosses WB at S and AT at R. IN crosses WB at F and AT at G. But the problem states that lines CJ and IN intersect at S and R? Or other points?

Wait, going back to the original constraints:

IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)): So, Line(W,B) intersects with Line(C,J) and Line(I,N) at Point(S). This suggests that all three lines WB, CJ, IN pass through S. So, S is a common point where WB, CJ, and IN meet. Similarly, IntersectAt(Line(A,T), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(R)) means that AT, CJ, IN meet at R. Hence, R is a common point where AT, CJ, and IN meet. So lines CJ and IN pass through both S and R? That would mean that lines CJ and IN are the same line, which is not possible unless S and R are the same point. But the problem mentions distinct points S and R, so this suggests inconsistency.

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the IntersectAt function is indicating that two lines intersect at a point, and the third line also passes through that point. For example, Line(W,B) and Line(C,J) intersect at S, and Line(I,N) also passes through S. Similarly, Line(A,T) and Line(C,J) intersect at R, and Line(I,N) passes through R. Hence, lines CJ and IN pass through S and R respectively. This would mean that lines CJ and IN are two separate lines, each passing through one of the points S or R, but not necessarily intersecting each other at those points.

This seems plausible. So:

- Line(W,B) intersects Line(C,J) at S, and Line(I,N) also passes through S. So S is on WB, CJ, and IN. Wait, no—if Line(W,B) intersects Line(C,J) at S, then S is on both WB and CJ. Additionally, Line(I,N) also passes through S, meaning S is on IN. So, S is the intersection of WB, CJ, and IN. Similarly, Line(A,T) intersects Line(C,J) at R, and Line(I,N) passes through R. So R is on AT, CJ, and IN. Therefore, R is the intersection of AT, CJ, and IN. Hence, lines CJ and IN intersect at both S and R? That would mean that lines CJ and IN intersect at S and R, implying that S and R are the same point, which would mean that lines CJ and IN intersect at S=R. Hence, S and R are the same point. But the problem lists them as distinct points, so this is confusing.

This suggests that the initial assumptions are flawed. Maybe the IntersectAt function is meant to specify that two lines intersect at a point, and the third line intersects them at different points. For example, Line(W,B) and Line(C,J) intersect at S, Line(W,B) and Line(I,N) intersect at F, and Line(C,J) and Line(I,N) intersect at G. But the original constraints say:

IntersectAt(Line(W,B), Line(C,J), Line(I,N), Point(S)) – this could mean that all three lines intersect at S, but that requires them to be concurrent. Similarly for other points. This seems to be the case, leading to multiple concurrent lines.

Given that, let's proceed under the assumption that lines WB, CJ, and IN meet at S, and lines AT, CJ, and IN meet at R. So, S and R are two different points where different sets of lines intersect. Thus, lines CJ and IN intersect both WB and AT at S and R respectively.

With that, let's consider the angles formed at these points.

At point S, which is the intersection of WB, CJ, and IN. Let's focus on the angles around S. Assume that line WB is horizontal, and line CJ is rising upwards, while line IN is rising at a different angle. At point S, the angle between WB and CJ is angle 1 = 50°. Then, the angle between CJ and IN at S would be angle 2, and the angle between IN and WB at S would be angle 3 = 60°. Wait, but angle 3 is given as 60°. If that's the case, then the sum of angles around point S would be angle 1 + angle 2 + angle 3 + ... ? Wait, around a point, the total is 360°, but if there are three lines meeting at a point, the angles between them would add up to 360°. Let me think: if three lines meet at a single point, they divide the plane into six angles, but depending on how they intersect. Alternatively, if two lines intersect, they form four angles. With a third line through the point, it adds more angles.

But maybe focusing on the angles formed by two lines at S. For example, at point S, lines WB and CJ form angle 1 = 50°, and lines CJ and IN form angle 2, and lines IN and WB form angle 3 = 60°. But then, the sum of these three angles would be 50 + 2 + 60 = 110 + 2 = 112°, which is less than 180°, suggesting that there are other angles. Wait, this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, if at point S, lines WB and CJ form angle 1 = 50°, and lines WB and IN form angle 3 = 60°, then the angle between CJ and IN at S would be 180° - 50° - 60° = 70°, assuming they form a triangle-like configuration. Wait, but if three lines meet at a point, the angles around that point sum to 360°. So, if we have three lines meeting at S, creating several angles. Let's say that between WB and CJ is angle 1 (50°), between CJ and IN is angle x, and between IN and WB is angle 3 (60°). Then, the sum of these three angles would be 50 + x + 60 = 110 + x. But around a point, the total is 360°, so the remaining angles would be 360 - (110 + x) = 250 - x. But this seems unclear without more info.

Alternatively, if the lines are arranged such that the angles around S are made up of two pairs of vertical angles. For example, if lines WB and CJ form angle 1 (50°) and its vertical angle, and lines CJ and IN form some angle, and so on. It's getting too vague.

Perhaps another approach: since WB || AT, and lines CJ and IN are transversals, then the angles formed by these transversals with the parallel lines will have relationships.

Assume that at point S (intersection of WB, CJ, IN), the angle between WB and CJ is 50° (angle 1). Since WB || AT, the corresponding angle at the intersection of CJ and AT would also be 50°. Let's call that angle 2. Then, at point R (intersection of AT, CJ, IN), the angle between AT and IN could be related to angle 3 = 60°.

But how does this help us find angle 6?

Alternatively, if angle 3 is an angle formed by IN and AT, which is 60°, then since IN is a transversal, the corresponding angle on WB would also be 60°. But if angle 1 is 50°, then the sum of angles around point S could involve these.

Wait, let's consider triangle formed by points S, R, and another intersection. For example, if lines CJ and IN intersect at S and R, but this is not possible unless they are the same line. So, maybe there's a triangle formed by S, R, and another point where lines meet.

Alternatively, considering that angle 1 and angle 3 are parts of a larger triangle or polygon, allowing us to apply the triangle angle sum theorem.

Let me try assigning angle measures:

Assume that at point S, angle between WB and CJ is 50° (angle 1), and at point R (intersection of AT, CJ, IN), the angle between AT and IN is 60° (angle 3). Then, since WB || AT, the angle between IN and WB would be equal to the angle between IN and AT, which is 60°, due to corresponding angles. So, at point S, the angle between IN and WB is 60°, which is angle 3. Then, the remaining angle at point S would be 180° - 50° - 60° = 70°, which could be angle 6? Wait, but why would that be?

Wait, if at point S, there are two lines: WB and IN, forming an angle of 60°, and another line CJ forming an angle of 50° with WB. The angle between CJ and IN would then be 180° - 50° - 60° = 70°, assuming they form a straight line. Wait, but if three lines meet at a point, the sum of the angles around that point is 360°, not 180°. So if we have three lines meeting at S, the angles around S would sum to 360°. Let's say the angle between WB and CJ is 50°, the angle between CJ and IN is x, and the angle between IN and WB is 60°. Then, the sum of these three angles plus the other angles around the point would be 360°. But without knowing how many angles there are, it's difficult. However, if we assume that these three angles are adjacent and form a full circle, then 50 + x + 60 = 360? No, that would be if they were the only angles, but that's not possible. Actually, three lines meeting at a point create six angles, but if we consider the ones formed by each pair of lines.

Alternatively, if we consider that at point S, the lines WB and CJ form an angle of 50°, and lines IN and WB form an angle of 60°, then the angle between IN and CJ would be 180° - 50° - 60° = 70°, assuming they are adjacent angles forming a straight line. Wait, no, because if you have two angles adjacent to a common side, their sum would be the angle between the non-common sides. But this is getting too ambiguous.

Let me try another method: using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and applying exterior angles.

Suppose there is a triangle where angles 1 and 3 are parts of it. For example, if angle 1 is one angle of a triangle, angle 3 is another, and angle 6 is the third. Then, angle 6 would be 180 - 50 - 60 = 70°, which would be option C. This matches one of the choices. But I need to verify if this is the case.

But why would angles 1 and 3 be two angles of a triangle? It depends on the configuration. If the diagram includes a triangle with angles 1, 3, and 6, then yes. For example, if lines CJ and IN intersect at a point, forming a triangle with one vertex at S or R, and angles 1 and 3 being two of its angles.

Alternatively, consider that angle 1 and angle 3 are remote interior angles of a triangle, and angle 6 is the exterior angle, which equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So, angle 6 = 50 + 60 = 110°, which is not one of the options. But this doesn't match.

Alternatively, if angle 6 is supplementary to the sum of angle 1 and angle 3, but that would be 180 - (50+60)=70°, which is option C. So if angle 6 is supplementary to the sum of 1 and 3, then it would be 70°. This seems plausible.

How can this happen? If angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent angles forming a linear pair with angle 6, then angle 6 would be supplementary to their sum. Wait, no, if they are adjacent, their sum would be supplementary to angle 6. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent to angle 6, forming a straight line, then angle 6 = 180 - (50 + 60) = 70°. This fits with option C.

Alternatively, if angle 6 is an exterior angle to a triangle where angles 1 and 3 are the remote interior angles, then angle 6 = 50 + 60 = 110°, but that's not an option. So the former scenario seems more likely.

Hence, if angle 6 is supplementary to the sum of angles 1 and 3, then it would be 70°, which is option C. This seems plausible, and since 70 is one of the choices, I'll go with that.
