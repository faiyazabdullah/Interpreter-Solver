====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So we have two similar triangles, triangle JKL and triangle WYZ. The question is asking for the value of x, given some angle measures related to these triangles.

First, I remember that when two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. That means each angle in triangle JKL corresponds to an angle in triangle WYZ. Also, the order of the letters matters here because similarity is based on the order of the vertices. So angle J corresponds to angle W, angle K to angle Y, and angle L to angle Z. Wait, but the problem says Triangle(J,K,L) ~ Triangle(W,Y,Z). Let me confirm that. If they're similar in that order, then angle J corresponds to angle W, angle K to angle Y, and angle L to angle Z. So the correspondence is J-W, K-Y, L-Z.

Now, looking at the given equations:

- Measure of Angle(J) equals 4x minus 13. So ∠J = 4x -13.
- Measure of Angle(W) is 71 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(Z) is 44 degrees.
- Also, it says Measure of Angle(J) equals Measure of Angle(W). So ∠J = ∠W. Since ∠W is 71°, that would mean ∠J is also 71°. Therefore, setting up the equation: 4x -13 = 71. Solving for x would give us x = (71 +13)/4 = 84/4 = 21. But wait, before jumping to conclusions, I need to check if there are other constraints that might affect this.

But hold on, maybe I should verify if all angles add up correctly. Because in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°. Let me check the angles for both triangles.

Starting with triangle WYZ. We know angle W is 71°, angle Z is 44°. Then angle Y can be found as 180 - 71 -44 = 65°. So angle Y is 65°. 

Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle K (in triangle JKL) corresponds to angle Y (in triangle WYZ), so ∠K = ∠Y = 65°. Similarly, angle L corresponds to angle Z, so ∠L = ∠Z = 44°. 

So in triangle JKL, angles are: ∠J = 71°, ∠K = 65°, ∠L = 44°. Let's check if they add up to 180°. 71 + 65 + 44 = 180? Let's compute: 71+65=136; 136+44=180. Yes, that works.

Wait, but according to the problem, angle J is given as 4x -13. And since angle J is 71°, solving 4x -13 =71 gives x= (71+13)/4 = 84/4=21. Which would make x=21. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 21. So that seems straightforward. But let me check again if there's something else.

Alternatively, could there be another way where angle J isn't directly equal to angle W? Wait, no. The similarity statement says Triangle(J,K,L) ~ Triangle(W,Y,Z). So the order implies that angle J corresponds to angle W, angle K to angle Y, angle L to angle Z. Therefore, their measures must be equal. Hence, ∠J = ∠W, which is 71°, leading to 4x-13=71. So x=21. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 21. Let me just cross-verify once more. Suppose x is 21, then angle J is 4*21 -13 = 84 -13=71°, which matches angle W. Then angles of triangle JKL are 71, 65, 44, adding to 180. All checks out. So yes, answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the two similar triangles $ \triangle JKL \sim \triangle WYZ $. Similarity implies that corresponding angles are congruent, i.e., $ \angle J = \angle W $, $ \angle K = \angle Y $, and $ \angle L = \angle Z $.

### Step 1: Use Given Angle Measures

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle W) = 71^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle Z) = 44^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle J) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle W) = 71^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle J) = 4x - 13 $

From the equality of corresponding angles due to similarity:

$$
\angle J = \angle W = 71^\circ
$$

Substitute into the expression for $ \angle J $:

$$
4x - 13 = 71
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Add 13 to both sides:

$$
4x = 84
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
x = \frac{84}{4} = 21
$$

### Step 3: Verify Consistency with Triangle Angle Sum

Let’s ensure that the internal angle values are consistent across both triangles.

In $ \triangle WYZ $:
- $ \angle W = 71^\circ $
- $ \angle Z = 44^\circ $
- Thus, $ \angle Y = 180^\circ - 71^\circ - 44^\circ = 65^\circ $

By similarity:
- $ \angle J = \angle W = 71^\circ $
- $ \angle K = \angle Y = 65^\circ $
- $ \angle L = \angle Z = 44^\circ $

Sum of angles in $ \triangle JKL $:  
$$
71^\circ + 65^\circ + 44^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

This confirms the consistency of the angle measures and validates our solution.
