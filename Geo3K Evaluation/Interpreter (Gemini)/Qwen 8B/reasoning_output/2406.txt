Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given points and lines. There are several points labeled B, C, D, I, E, F, G, H. The lines mentioned include FB, DB, CI, DC, IG, DE, CH. Also, there are parallel lines FB and CI. Then there are various angles measured with expressions involving x. 

Let me start by listing out all the angle measures given:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,F)) = Sub(x,1) → Let's call this Angle D-B-F as (x-1) degrees.
2. MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,B)) = 79 degrees.
3. MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)) = Add(x,10) → So that's (x + 10) degrees.
4. MeasureOf(Angle(B,I,G)) = Mul(2,x) → That's 2x degrees.
5. Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I))), 180). So Angle EDB plus Angle BDI equals 180°.
6. Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))), 180). So Angle HCI plus Angle IGB equals 180°.
7. Congruent(Angle(D,B,F), Angle(B,C,I)). Therefore, Angle D-B-F equals Angle B-C-I. But MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I)) is given as Sub(x,1), which is same as Angle D-B-F. Wait, but earlier we had MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,F)) = x-1. So that means Angle BCI is also x-1 degrees. But wait, there's another measure given for Angle(B,C,I): it says MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I), Sub(x,1))? Wait, no, looking back: 

Wait, original problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,F), Sub(x,1))

MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,B), 79)

MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I), Add(x,10))

MeasureOf(Angle(B,I,G), Mul(2,x))

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I))), 180)

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))), 180)

Congruent(Angle(D,B,F), Angle(B,C,I))

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I), Sub(x,1))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I)), 101)

Oh, so the last line says MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I)) is 101 degrees. So that gives us some equations. Let me note down all these relations:

First, since Angle D-B-F ≅ Angle B-C-I (they're congruent), and MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,F)) = x - 1, then MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I)) is also x - 1. However, there's another line saying MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I), Sub(x,1)), which seems redundant? Or maybe that was a typo? Wait, perhaps the user meant that MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,I)) is equal to x - 1? Which would make sense because they are congruent. So that gives us that Angle BCI is x - 1 degrees.

Now, let's look at the equations given. 

First equation: Sum of Angle EDB (which is 79°) and Angle BDI equals 180°. Since Angle EDB is 79°, then Angle BDI = 180 - 79 = 101°. Wait, but there's another equation that says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I)), 101). So that confirms that Angle BDI is 101°. 

So, Angle BDI is 101°, which is part of triangle BDI? Or maybe part of some other figure. Let me think about how these angles relate.

Also, there's the second equation: Sum of Angle H C I (which is x + 10) and Angle I G B equals 180°. So Angle H C I is x + 10, and Angle I G B is something else. Let me denote Angle IGB as y, then x + 10 + y = 180 => y = 180 - (x + 10) = 170 - x. But Angle IGB is given as MeasureOf(Angle(B,I,G)) which is 2x. Wait, no. Wait, Angle IGB is the same as Angle BGI? Because angle names can vary depending on vertex. Let me check:

The measure of Angle(B,I,G) is 2x. So that's angle at point I between points B and G. Wait, no. The notation Angle(B,I,G) refers to the angle at point I, with segments IB and IG. So that's angle at I between B and G. So that's angle B-I-G. So that's different from Angle I G B, which would be the angle at point G between points I and B. Wait, but in the sum, it's Angle(H,C,I) and Angle(I,G,B). Let me parse that again.

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))) equals 180. So Angle H C I is at point C, between H and I. And Angle I G B is at point G between I and B. Hmm. Not sure yet how these connect.

But let's get back to the first equation. We have Angle EDB is 79°, and Angle BDI is 101°, which adds up to 180°, so that checks out. Now, Angle BDI is 101°, which is part of triangle BDI? Maybe. Also, considering that lines DB and CI are connected via some relationships.

Also, since lines FB and CI are parallel. So, Line(F,B) || Line(C,I). So FB || CI. That might mean that certain angles are corresponding or alternate interior angles.

Looking at Angle D-B-F, which is x -1 degrees. Since FB is parallel to CI, and if there's a transversal cutting them, then maybe there are corresponding angles. For example, if line BD intersects both FB and CI, then maybe some angles are equal. Wait, line DB connects points D and B. So line DB could be a transversal intersecting the two parallel lines FB and CI.

Wait, point D is connected to B (line DB), and line CI is connected to point C and I. Wait, maybe we need to find some relationship here. Let me consider the angles formed by the transversal DB with the parallel lines FB and CI.

Since FB || CI, and DB is a transversal. So, angle at B between FB and DB (which is angle D-B-F, which is x -1) should correspond to an angle at point C between CI and some line. Wait, but the transversal is DB. So when the transversal crosses the parallel lines FB and CI, the angles would be:

At point B, the angle between FB and DB is angle D-B-F (x -1). At point C, the transversal DB would cross CI. Wait, but line DB connects D and B. If CI is parallel to FB, then the intersection of DB with CI would occur at some point. Wait, but point I is connected to C via line CI. Is point I on line DB? Probably not necessarily. Maybe we need to consider other intersections.

Alternatively, maybe there are triangles involved. Let me see. Let's consider triangle D-B-F. Wait, angle at B is angle D-B-F, which is x-1. Also, angle E-D-B is 79°, which is angle at D between E and B. Since line DE is drawn, connecting D and E. 

Also, angle E-D-B is 79°, which is part of triangle EDB. Since angle at D is 79°, angle at B is angle D-B-F? No, angle at B in triangle EDB would be angle EBD. Wait, but maybe not. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Points D, E, B. Line DE is connected, and line DB is connected. So triangle EDB has vertices E, D, B. The angle at D is angle EDB = 79°, as given. The angle at B would be angle EBD, which may be related to other angles. But we also know that angle BDI is 101°, which is adjacent to angle EBD?

Wait, angle BDI is at point D between points B and I. So if we have point I somewhere, then DI is a segment from D to I. So angle BDI is part of triangle BDI. But how does that connect to other parts?

Alternatively, maybe considering that angle EDB is 79°, and angle BDI is 101°, which together form a straight line? Wait, if points E, B, and I are arranged such that EDB and BDI are adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Wait, if ED and BI are on a straight line, then yes. But without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. However, since their sum is 180°, that suggests that those two angles form a linear pair, meaning that points E, D, and I are colinear? Or maybe points E and I are on opposite sides of DB?

Wait, but angle EDB is at D, between E and B. Angle BDI is at D between B and I. So if those two angles add up to 180°, then points E, I must be on opposite sides of line DB. So that implies that ED and DI are in a straight line? So E, D, I are colinear? Wait, if angle EDB and angle BDI are adjacent angles at point D adding to 180°, then EDI is a straight line. Hence, points E, D, I are colinear. Therefore, line EI passes through D. 

That's helpful information. So line EI goes through D. So E-D-I are colinear. Therefore, line DI is extended beyond D to point E? Wait, no. If E is connected to D, and I is connected to D, then E and I are on opposite sides of D along the line. So DI is part of line EI. 

This is important. So with that, we can consider triangle DIB, but also triangle D... Well, maybe not. Let me think about other angles.

Given that lines FB and CI are parallel. Also, angle D-B-F is x -1, which is congruent to angle B-C-I (since they are congruent). So angle B-C-I is also x -1. 

Let me consider triangle BCI. In triangle BCI, angle at C is angle BCI, which is x -1. What other angles do we know? Well, if we can find more angles in triangle BCI, maybe we can set up equations.

But also, line CI is parallel to FB. So maybe there's a transversal creating similar triangles or using alternate interior angles. For instance, if we consider line BC intersecting the parallel lines FB and CI. Wait, line BC connects points B and C. Wait, but line CI is already defined. So line BC and line CI meet at point C. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since FB || CI, and line DI (which is part of line EI) intersects them. So line DI intersects FB at B and CI at I. Therefore, the angles formed by the transversal DI with the parallel lines FB and CI. 

In that case, the corresponding angles would be angle at B (between FB and DI) and angle at I (between CI and DI). So angle D-B-F corresponds to angle I-D-I? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal. Here, the transversal is DI, crossing FB at B and CI at I. So the angle at B between FB and DI is angle D-B-F, which is x -1. The corresponding angle at I would be the angle between CI and DI. That angle would be angle I-D-I? Wait, no. The angle at I between CI and DI. Since DI is going from D to I. So at point I, the angle between CI and DI would be angle C-I-D. Wait, but angle C-I-D is part of triangle CID? Not sure yet.

But since FB || CI, then angle D-B-F (at B) is equal to angle C-I-D (at I). Therefore, angle C-I-D equals x -1. 

But angle C-I-D is part of triangle CID. Also, we have angle H-C-I which is x + 10 degrees. Wait, angle H-C-I is at point C between H and I. So that's angle H-C-I. How does that relate to other angles?

Additionally, there's line CH, which connects C and H. And line CI connects C and I. So angle at C between H and I is angle H-C-I = x +10 degrees. So if we can find other angles at point C, maybe we can use that.

Also, there's line CG, which is connected to point G. Wait, line I-G is connected. So point G is connected to I. And angle B-I-G is 2x degrees. So angle at I between B and G is 2x. Also, earlier we had that angle C-I-D is x -1. 

So let's think about the angles around point I. At point I, we have angles involving lines CI, IG, and possibly others. 

We know that angle C-I-D is x -1 (from the parallel lines). Also, angle I-G-B is part of the second equation, which summed with angle H-C-I equals 180°. So angle H-C-I is x+10, angle I-G-B is ?

Earlier, we said that angle I-G-B is part of the sum that equals 180° with angle H-C-I. So:

angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°

Therefore,

(x + 10) + angle I-G-B = 180 ⇒ angle I-G-B = 180 - x -10 = 170 - x.

But angle I-G-B is the same as angle B-G-I? Wait, angle I-G-B is the angle at point G between points I and B. So that's angle IGB. But earlier, we were told that angle B-I-G is 2x degrees. Wait, angle B-I-G is at point I between B and G. So that's different from angle I-G-B. 

Wait, angle B-I-G is at point I, between B and G. Whereas angle I-G-B is at point G, between I and B. These are different angles. However, maybe there's a relationship between them. For example, if lines BG and GI form some triangle or something. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle BGI has angles that can be analyzed. Let's consider triangle BGI. In triangle BGI, we know angle at I is angle B-I-G = 2x. If we can find other angles in this triangle, maybe we can relate them. 

But we need more information. Alternatively, since angle I-G-B is 170 - x, which is part of triangle IGB? Wait, angle at G is angle I-G-B = 170 - x, angle at I is angle B-I-G = 2x, and the third angle at B would be angle I-B-G. Wait, but unless we know more about the triangle, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other relationships. Let me recap the knowns:

From the first equation, we have angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, which sum to 180°, confirming that E-D-I are colinear.

From the congruence of angles D-B-F and B-C-I, both being x -1 degrees.

From the parallel lines FB || CI, leading to angle D-B-F = angle C-I-D = x -1 degrees.

So angle C-I-D is x -1. Let's consider triangle C-ID. In triangle CID, we have angle at I: angle C-I-D = x -1. What about other angles? If we can find other angles in this triangle.

But point H is connected to C via line CH. So angle H-C-I is x + 10 degrees. This is the angle at point C between H and I. So in triangle H-C-I or something else. 

If we can find the angles at point C, maybe we can find relations. Let me think about point C. It's connected to points I, H, and B? Wait, line CI connects C and I, line CH connects C and H. Also, line CB connects C and B? Wait, line CB isn't directly mentioned except for line DC and line CI. Wait, original lines are:

Line(D,B), Line(C,I), Line(D,C), Line(I,G), Line(D,E), Line(C,H). So point C is connected to I (line CI), to D (line DC), and to H (line CH). So at point C, there are three lines: CD, CI, and CH. 

So at point C, angles between these lines. For example, angle between CD and CI is angle D-C-I. Also, angle between CI and CH is angle H-C-I = x +10. And angle between CD and CH would be angle D-C-H. 

But we don't have info on that. However, we know that angle B-C-I is x -1 degrees (from congruence). Wait, angle B-C-I is at point C between B and I. So that's angle B-C-I. How does that relate to other angles at point C?

Since line DC connects D and C. So point D is connected to C. So line DC is present. So angle at point C between D and I is angle D-C-I. Also, angle B-C-I is another angle at point C. Depending on the configuration, these angles might be adjacent or part of a larger structure.

Assuming that points B, C, D are connected via line DC and line CB? Wait, line DC is present, and line CB isn't explicitly mentioned. Wait, line CB isn't listed. Wait, original lines are Line(D,B), Line(D,C), etc. So line DB is present, line DC is present. So point C is connected to D and to I and H. Point B is connected to D and to F. 

Hmm. Let me try to think about triangle BCD? Not sure. Alternatively, focusing on angles at point C:

We have angle B-C-I = x -1 (from congruence), angle H-C-I = x +10, and angle D-C-I. Are these angles adjacent? If line CB is connected, then angle B-C-I and angle D-C-I could be adjacent if points B, D, and I are arranged in a way. Wait, but without knowing exact positions, it's challenging. 

However, if we assume that line CB is connected, then angle B-C-I and angle D-C-I would be adjacent angles forming a larger angle. But since we don't know the exact configuration, maybe we need another approach.

Let me recall that angle B-C-I is x -1. Also, angle C-I-D is x -1 (from the parallel lines). So angle at point I between C and D is x -1. So in triangle CID, we have angle at I: x -1, angle at D: ? Let's see. 

Wait, triangle CID has points C, I, D. At point D, we have angle C-D-I. But angle C-D-I is part of angle B-D-I, which is 101 degrees. Wait, angle B-D-I is 101 degrees. So angle B-D-I is the angle at D between B and I. So that includes angle C-D-I if line DC is part of that. Wait, if line DC is connected to D, then angle C-D-I is part of angle B-D-I. 

So angle B-D-I = angle C-D-I + angle B-D-C? Or depends on the position. Let me think: at point D, angle between B and I is 101 degrees. If line DC is connected to D, then angle between D-B and D-I is 101 degrees. If line DC is in between, then angle between D-B and D-C plus angle between D-C and D-I equals 101 degrees. 

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult. However, since line DC is present and line DB is present, they both originate from D. So angle between DC and DB is angle C-D-B. Wait, but angle C-D-B would be part of triangle DBC. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that angle C-I-D is x -1 and angle B-D-I is 101 degrees. If we can express angle C-D-I in terms of other variables. 

Let me consider triangle CID. In triangle CID, we have:

angle at I: angle C-I-D = x -1

angle at D: angle C-D-I = ?

angle at C: angle C-I-D? Wait, no. In triangle CID, the angles are at points C, I, D. So angle at I is x -1, angle at D is angle C-D-I, and angle at C is angle D-C-I. 

But we don't know angle at C. However, angle D-C-I is part of angle B-C-I? Or not necessarily. Wait, angle B-C-I is at point C between B and I. If line DC is connected to point C, then angle D-C-I would be adjacent to angle B-C-I if line DC is extending from C towards D. 

Assuming that line DC extends from D to C, then at point C, angle between D and I would be angle D-C-I. And angle B-C-I is another angle at point C. So if lines CB and CI are connected, then angle between CB and CI is angle B-C-I. 

But how do these relate? If we consider that angle D-C-I and angle B-C-I are adjacent angles forming a larger angle. But unless we know more about the configuration, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the sum of angles in triangle CID. Let's suppose that in triangle CID, the angles sum to 180°. So:

angle at I (x -1) + angle at D (let's call it α) + angle at C (β) = 180°

But we need more info about α and β. 

Alternatively, if we can relate β (angle at C) to angle H-C-I. Earlier, angle H-C-I is x +10 degrees. If angle H-C-I is part of angle at C, maybe related to β. 

For instance, if line CH is connected to C, then angle H-C-I is part of angle at C between H and I. So if line CH is connected, then angle H-C-I is adjacent to angle B-C-I or something else. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is getting too abstract. Let me try to focus on the equations we have.

We have:

From the second equation: angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°, which we wrote as (x + 10) + (170 - x) = 180. Wait, substituting angle I-G-B as 170 - x. Let's check:

(x + 10) + (170 - x) = x +10 +170 -x = 180. Which simplifies to 180=180. So this equation doesn't give us new information. So that tells us nothing. So that equation is just an identity. So we need to find another relation.

Let me go back to the angles involving x. We have:

Angle D-B-F = x -1

Angle B-C-I = x -1 (congruent)

Angle H-C-I = x +10

Angle B-I-G = 2x

Also, angle B-D-I = 101°, which we've established.

Let me think about triangle BDI. In triangle BDI, we have angle at D is angle B-D-I = 101°, angle at B is angle D-B-I, and angle at I is angle B-I-D. Wait, but we might not know those angles directly.

Wait, angle D-B-F is x -1, which is at point B between D and F. But angle D-B-I is different. Unless there's a relationship between angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I. 

If line BF is connected to point F, and line BI is connected to point I. Since FB || CI, and assuming some transversals, maybe there's a relationship. 

Alternatively, since angle D-B-F is x-1, and if we can find angle D-B-I, which is part of triangle BDI. 

But angle D-B-I is part of angle BDI. Wait, angle BDI is 101°, which is the angle at D between B and I. So angle D-B-I is the same as angle BDI? No, angle BDI is at D between B and I. Wait, angle at D is angle B-D-I, which is 101°. So in triangle BDI, angle at D is 101°, angle at B is angle D-B-I, and angle at I is angle B-I-D. 

But without more info, it's still unclear. 

Wait, but maybe angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I are related. If lines BF and BI are connected, and if there's a transversal or something. Wait, point F is connected to B, and point I is connected to C and to G. 

Alternatively, since FB || CI, and if there's a transversal through B and I. Wait, line BI connects B to I. So BI is a transversal cutting FB and CI. Since FB || CI, then the angles formed by BI with FB and CI would be equal. 

So, angle between BI and FB at B is angle D-B-F (since line BI passes through B, and line FB is connected to B). Wait, no. Line BI starts at B and goes to I. So at point B, the angle between FB and BI would be angle F-B-I. Similarly, at point I, the angle between CI and BI would be angle C-I-B. Since FB || CI, these angles would be equal. 

Therefore, angle F-B-I = angle C-I-B. 

But angle F-B-I is part of angle D-B-F? No. Wait, angle D-B-F is at point B between D and F. If line BI is passing through B, then angle between FB and BI would be angle F-B-I. Which is different from angle D-B-F. Unless BI coincides with BD? 

Wait, line DB connects D and B. So BI is a separate line from DB unless I is on line DB. But since earlier we concluded that E-D-I are colinear, and DI is part of that line. So if I is on line DI, which is part of line EI. So unless B is on line DI, which we don't know. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently. Let's collect all the equations we have:

1. From the first equation: angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, so E-D-I are colinear.

2. From congruence: angle D-B-F = angle B-C-I = x -1.

3. From parallel lines FB || CI: angle D-B-F = angle C-I-D = x -1.

4. From the second equation: angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°, which gave us angle I-G-B = 170 - x.

5. From the angle measures: angle B-I-G = 2x.

Now, let's look at triangle BGI. In triangle BGI, we have angle at I: angle B-I-G = 2x, angle at G: angle I-G-B = 170 - x, so the third angle at B would be angle G-B-I. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:

angle B-I-G + angle I-G-B + angle G-B-I = 180

=> 2x + (170 - x) + angle G-B-I = 180

=> x + 170 + angle G-B-I = 180

=> angle G-B-I = 180 - x -170 = 10 - x

But angles in a triangle cannot be negative, so 10 - x > 0 => x < 10. But looking at the answer choices, the smallest option is A. 68, which is much bigger than 10. This suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, this indicates a contradiction. Perhaps my identification of angle I-G-B as 170 - x is incorrect? Let me re-examine that step.

Earlier, I said angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°, so angle I-G-B = 180 - (x + 10) = 170 - x. But angle I-G-B is the angle at G between I and B, while angle B-I-G is at I between B and G. Are these angles supplementary? Only if points I, G, B are arranged in a particular way. 

But if angle H-C-I and angle I-G-B are supplementary, it's possible only under certain configurations. Perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which angles are supplementary. Let me double-check the original constraint:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))), 180)

So, Angle(H,C,I) + Angle(I,G,B) = 180°. 

Angle(H,C,I) is at point C between H and I. Angle(I,G,B) is at point G between I and B. These two angles are not necessarily adjacent or supplementary unless there's a specific reason. So my previous assumption that they are supplementary might be incorrect. 

Wait, but why are these two angles added together? It could be that they are vertical angles, or part of a linear pair, or related through some other geometric property. Without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell. 

Perhaps I need to consider triangle CGI or something else. Let me think about point G. Line I-G is present. Also, angle B-I-G is 2x. So at point I, angle between B and G is 2x. Also, angle C-I-D is x -1. If we can relate these angles.

At point I, we have multiple angles. For example, angle C-I-D = x -1 (from parallel lines), angle B-I-G = 2x (given), and possibly angle I-G-B (as before). If we can find the sum of angles around point I.

Around point I, the sum of angles is 360°. So, if we consider angles around point I:

- angle C-I-D = x -1

- angle B-I-G = 2x

- angle I-G-B = ?

- and possibly other angles.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that line DG passes through I or something like that, but we don't have info on that.

Alternatively, maybe angle C-I-D and angle I-G-B are supplementary? Or something else. 

Let me consider the possibility that angle C-I-D and angle I-G-B are supplementary. So x -1 + (angle I-G-B) = 180. But then angle I-G-B = 180 - (x -1) = 181 - x. But earlier, from the equation, angle I-G-B = 170 - x. So combining these would give 181 - x = 170 - x => 181 = 170, which is impossible. So this suggests that my assumptions are wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's use the information about triangle BGI. We have angle at I: 2x, angle at G: ?, angle at B: ?. But without more info, it's stuck.

Wait, but there's another relation: angle BDI is 101°, which is part of triangle BDI. Let's explore that. In triangle BDI, angles are:

- at D: angle B-D-I = 101°

- at B: angle D-B-I

- at I: angle B-I-D

Sum to 180°, so:

101 + angle D-B-I + angle B-I-D = 180

=> angle D-B-I + angle B-I-D = 79°

But what are these angles? Angle D-B-I is at point B between D and I. Angle B-I-D is at point I between B and D. 

But we also have angle D-B-F = x -1. If line BF is connected to point F, and line BI is connected to I. If line BF and BI are related, maybe they form some relationship. 

For example, if points F, B, I are colinear, then angle D-B-F would be the same as angle D-B-I. But there's no indication that F and I are on the same line. 

Alternatively, if line FI passes through B, then angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I would be adjacent. But again, without knowing the diagram, it's speculative. 

But let's assume that angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I are adjacent angles forming a linear pair. That would mean that points F, B, I are colinear. If that's the case, then angle D-B-F + angle D-B-I = 180°, since they are supplementary. 

So:

(x -1) + angle D-B-I = 180°

=> angle D-B-I = 180 - (x -1) = 181 - x

But angle D-B-I is part of triangle BDI. Earlier, we had angle D-B-I + angle B-I-D = 79°, so:

(181 - x) + angle B-I-D = 79

=> angle B-I-D = 79 - (181 - x) = x - 102

But angle B-I-D is an angle in triangle BDI. Since angles can't be negative, x - 102 ≥ 0 => x ≥ 102. But looking at the answer choices, none are above 136. Option D is 136. So if x is 136, then angle B-I-D = 136 - 102 = 34°, which is valid. But this is just one possibility.

But this relies on the assumption that angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I are supplementary, which may not be true. However, let's proceed with this assumption to see if it leads us anywhere.

So angle B-I-D = x - 102. But angle B-I-D is also part of another context. For instance, if we consider triangle BID, and maybe other relationships.

But also, angle B-I-D is at point I between B and D. Earlier, we had angle C-I-D = x -1 (from parallel lines). So at point I, angle between C and D is x -1, and angle between B and D is angle B-I-D = x - 102. If these angles are adjacent, then the total angle at point I between C and B would be (x -1) + (x -102) = 2x - 103. But unless there's a reason for this, it's not clear.

Alternatively, if line IC is connected to point I, and line ID is connected to point I, then angle at I between C and D is x -1, and angle at I between B and D is x -102. If these are adjacent, then angle between C and B at point I would be (x -1) + (x -102) = 2x - 103. But this might be part of another triangle or angle.

But we also have angle B-I-G = 2x. If angle B-I-G is at point I between B and G, then it might be part of a larger angle. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to use the other equations. 

We have angle B-I-G = 2x, and angle I-G-B = ? From the earlier equation, angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180. So if we can find angle I-G-B in terms of x, perhaps we can relate it to other angles.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Let me try to think of another approach.

We have two equations involving x:

1. From the first equation: angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, which we used.

2. From the congruence: angle D-B-F = x -1, angle B-C-I = x -1.

3. From the parallel lines: angle C-I-D = x -1.

4. From the second equation: angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°.

5. From the measure of angle B-I-G = 2x.

Maybe we can find another equation by considering triangle BGI or other triangles.

In triangle BGI, we have angle at I: 2x, angle at G: let's call it y, angle at B: z. So 2x + y + z = 180. But we need to find relations between y and z.

But we also have angle I-G-B = y, which is part of the equation angle H-C-I + y = 180, so y = 180 - (x +10) = 170 - x. So substituting into the triangle equation:

2x + (170 - x) + z = 180

=> x + 170 + z = 180

=> z = 10 - x

But angle z is angle at B in triangle BGI, which is angle G-B-I. Now, if we can relate this angle to other parts.

Is angle G-B-I related to any other angles? For example, if line GB is connected to B, and we have other angles at B. 

At point B, we have angle D-B-F = x -1, and angle G-B-I = 10 - x. If these angles are adjacent, then their sum could be part of a larger angle. 

For instance, if line BF and line BI are connected at B, then angle D-B-F and angle G-B-I might be adjacent. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Assume that angle D-B-F and angle G-B-I are adjacent at point B, forming a larger angle. Then:

(x -1) + (10 - x) = 9°. But this would imply that the sum is 9°, which might not make sense unless there's a specific reason.

Alternatively, if these angles are vertical or something else. 

But this seems unproductive. Let me try to consider that angle G-B-I = 10 - x, and since angles can't be negative, 10 - x > 0 => x < 10. But this contradicts the answer choices, which range from 68 to 136. So this suggests that our assumption about angle I-G-B = 170 - x is wrong.

This means that my earlier assumption that angle I-G-B = 170 - x is incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Original statement: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))), 180). So angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180. 

But angle H-C-I is x +10, and angle I-G-B is unknown. So let's call angle I-G-B as y. Then:

x +10 + y = 180 => y = 170 - x.

But this led to inconsistency in triangle BGI. So perhaps the error lies elsewhere. 

Let me revisit the triangle BGI. If angle I-G-B = y = 170 - x, and angle B-I-G = 2x, then in triangle BGI:

2x + y + z = 180 => 2x + (170 - x) + z = 180 => x + 170 + z = 180 => z = 10 - x. 

But if z is an angle at B, and we have another angle at B, which is angle D-B-F = x -1. If these are supplementary, then:

z + (x -1) = 180 => (10 - x) + (x -1) = 9 = 180, which is false. 

Alternatively, if z and (x -1) are part of the same angle, then their sum would be something else. 

But this suggests that there's a contradiction, implying that my assumption about angle I-G-B is wrong. 

Maybe angle I-G-B is not y = 170 - x, but something else. Let me reconsider the relationship between angle H-C-I and angle I-G-B. 

Perhaps these angles are not directly supplementary but related through another geometric principle. For example, if lines HI and GB are parallel, or if there's a transversal. 

Alternatively, if angle H-C-I and angle I-G-B are corresponding angles or something. 

But without knowing the diagram, it's challenging. Let me try to think about the other given information. 

We have angle B-C-I = x -1. And angle H-C-I = x +10. So at point C, between H and I, angle is x +10, and between B and I, angle is x -1. If these angles are adjacent, then the total angle at point C between H and B would be (x +10) + (x -1) = 2x +9. 

But unless there's a line connecting H and B, or some other relation, this might not help. 

Wait, but line CH is connected to point C, and line CI is connected. So at point C, we have lines CH, CI, and possibly CB. If line CB is connected, then angle between CB and CI is x -1, and between CB and CH is something else. 

But we don't know about line CB. Wait, line DC is connected to C, and line CI is connected. So at point C, we have lines CD, CI, and CH. 

If we consider the angles at point C: angle between CD and CI, angle between CI and CH, and angle between CD and CH. 

But angle between CI and CH is x +10 (angle H-C-I). Angle between CD and CI is angle D-C-I. And angle between CD and CH is angle D-C-H. 

But without knowing more, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me try to use the information about the congruent angles. We have angle D-B-F = x -1, and angle B-C-I = x -1. Also, from the parallel lines, angle C-I-D = x -1. 

So at point I, angle C-I-D = x -1, and angle B-I-G = 2x. If these are part of a triangle or something. 

Let me consider triangle CIG. If points C, I, G are connected, then in triangle CIG, we have angle at I: angle C-I-G. But angle B-I-G is 2x, and angle C-I-G would be part of that. If line CG is connected, then angle at I between C and G is part of angle B-I-G. 

But this is too vague. 

Let me try to summarize what I have:

Equations derived so far:

1. angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, so E-D-I are colinear.

2. angle D-B-F = x -1, angle B-C-I = x -1, angle C-I-D = x -1.

3. angle H-C-I = x +10.

4. angle B-I-G = 2x.

5. angle I-G-B = 170 - x (from equation).

6. In triangle BGI: 2x + (170 - x) + (10 - x) = 180, which is 180 = 180. So no new info.

But this suggests that the equation is always true, giving no new information. So we need another equation to solve for x. 

Let me revisit the angle at point I. At point I, we have angle C-I-D = x -1 (from parallel lines), and angle B-I-G = 2x. If these are adjacent angles, then the total angle at I between C and G would be (x -1) + 2x = 3x -1. But unless this relates to another angle, it's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if line IG is part of some other structure. 

Wait, angle B-I-G = 2x, and angle C-I-D = x -1. If these are related through some transversal or parallel lines, but I don't see the connection.

Let me think about the sum of angles around point I. Assuming that point I has several angles:

- angle C-I-D = x -1

- angle B-I-G = 2x

- angle I-G-B = 170 - x (from earlier)

- and possibly other angles.

But the sum of all angles around point I should be 360°. So:

angle C-I-D + angle B-I-G + angle I-G-B + ... = 360°

But unless we know all the angles at point I, this is difficult. Let's assume that there are only three angles at point I: C-I-D, B-I-G, and I-G-B. Then:

(x -1) + 2x + (170 - x) = 360?

Wait, no. If angle C-I-D is x -1, angle B-I-G is 2x, and angle I-G-B is 170 - x, then their sum would be:

(x -1) + 2x + (170 - x) = x -1 + 2x +170 -x = 2x +169. Setting this equal to 360°:

2x +169 = 360 => 2x = 191 => x = 95.5. But this is not among the answer choices. So this suggests that there are more angles at point I, or my assumptions are wrong.

This indicates that my earlier assumption about the angles at point I is incomplete. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's use the fact that angle BDI = 101°, and angle D-B-F = x -1. If I can relate these angles through some triangle or using the parallel lines.

Since FB || CI, and line DB is a transversal, then angle D-B-F (x -1) is equal to angle C-I-D (x -1), as previously stated. 

Now, let's consider triangle BDI. We know angle at D is 101°, and we need to find other angles. Let's say angle at B is angle D-B-I, and angle at I is angle B-I-D.

From earlier, if we assume that angle D-B-F and angle D-B-I are supplementary (if F and I are on a straight line through B), then:

angle D-B-F + angle D-B-I = 180°

=> (x -1) + angle D-B-I = 180

=> angle D-B-I = 181 - x

Then, in triangle BDI:

angle at D: 101°

angle at B: 181 - x

angle at I: angle B-I-D = 180 - 101 - (181 - x) = 180 - 101 -181 + x = x - 102

But angle B-I-D is at point I between B and D. Earlier, we had angle C-I-D = x -1. If these two angles are adjacent, then the total angle at I between C and B would be (x -1) + (x -102) = 2x - 103. 

But if this angle is part of another triangle or line, it might help. For example, if line IB is connected, and angle at I between C and B is 2x - 103, and we also have angle B-I-G = 2x. If these are related, maybe:

2x - 103 + 2x = 180°, assuming they form a straight line. But this is speculative. 

Let me try this: if angle between C and B at I (2x - 103) and angle B-I-G (2x) are supplementary, then:

(2x - 103) + 2x = 180

=> 4x - 103 = 180

=> 4x = 283

=> x = 70.75. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if angle between C and B at I (2x - 103) is equal to angle B-I-G (2x), then:

2x - 103 = 2x => -103 = 0, which is impossible. 

This suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Let me try another route. Let's use the equation from the first part: angle BDI = 101°, and angle D-B-F = x -1. If I can find a relationship between these angles using other parts.

Since FB || CI, and line DI is a transversal, then angle D-B-F (x -1) is equal to angle C-I-D (x -1), as before. 

Now, let's consider triangle CIDI? No, it's triangle CID. In triangle CID, we have angle at I: x -1, angle at D: let's call it a, angle at C: let's call it b. So:

a + b + (x -1) = 180

But we need to find a and b.

Angle at D (a) is part of angle BDI = 101°. If line DC is connected to D, then angle at D between C and I is a, and angle between B and C is part of angle BDI. 

Wait, angle BDI is at D between B and I. If line DC is connected, then angle between B and C at D is part of angle BDI. So angle between B and C at D is angle C-D-B, and angle between C and I at D is a. So:

angle C-D-B + a = 101°

But angle C-D-B is part of triangle CDB. Without knowing more about this triangle, it's hard to proceed.

But we know that angle B-C-I = x -1. If we can relate angle C-D-B to angle B-C-I.

If lines CB and CI are connected, then angle at C between B and I is x -1, and angle at C between D and I is angle D-C-I. If these are adjacent, then angle D-C-I + x -1 = angle at C between D and B. But unless we know more about the configuration, this is speculation.

Let me assume that angle D-C-I + angle B-C-I = angle D-C-B. But angle D-C-B is part of triangle DBC. 

But without knowing the measure of angle D-C-B, this is not helpful.

At this point, I'm realizing that I might need to use the answer choices to test values. Let's try each option and see which fits.

Option A: x = 68

Let's plug x = 68 into the equations.

From angle D-B-F = x -1 = 67°

Angle B-C-I = 67°

Angle H-C-I = x +10 = 78°

Angle B-I-G = 2x = 136°

From the equation angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°, so angle I-G-B = 180 - 78 = 102°

In triangle BGI, angles are 136° (at I), 102° (at G), and angle at B = 180 - 136 - 102 = -58°, which is invalid. So x=68 is invalid.

Option B: x = 78

Then:

angle D-B-F = 77°

angle B-C-I = 77°

angle H-C-I = 78 + 10 = 88°

angle B-I-G = 2*78 = 156°

angle I-G-B = 180 - 88 = 92°

In triangle BGI: angles are 156°, 92°, and 180 - 156 - 92 = -68°. Invalid. So no good.

Option C: x = 79

angle D-B-F = 78°

angle B-C-I = 78°

angle H-C-I = 79 + 10 = 89°

angle B-I-G = 2*79 = 158°

angle I-G-B = 180 - 89 = 91°

Triangle BGI: 158 + 91 + angle at B = 180 → angle at B = 180 - 158 - 91 = -69°. Still invalid.

Option D: x = 136

angle D-B-F = 135°

angle B-C-I = 135°

angle H-C-I = 136 + 10 = 146°

angle B-I-G = 2*136 = 272°, which is greater than 180°, impossible for a triangle. So invalid.

All options lead to invalid results. This suggests that there's a miscalculation in my reasoning.

Let me revisit the assumption about angle I-G-B. Maybe it's not 170 - x, but something else. Let me re-express the equation:

angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°

We have angle H-C-I = x +10, so angle I-G-B = 180 - (x +10) = 170 - x.

But in triangle BGI, this gives angle at G as 170 - x, angle at I as 2x, and angle at B as 10 - x. 

If 10 - x is positive, x < 10, but none of the options are less than 10. So this suggests that the error is in assuming that angle I-G-B is 170 - x. 

Maybe the equation is not angle H-C-I + angle I-G-B = 180°, but something else. Let me recheck the original problem.

Original constraint: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,I)), MeasureOf(Angle(I,G,B))), 180)

So it's the sum of angle H-C-I and angle I-G-B equals 180°. So my calculation is correct. 

But if this leads to contradictions, maybe there's another relationship. Let me think about the angle at point I.

At point I, we have angle C-I-D = x -1 (from parallel lines), and angle B-I-G = 2x. If these are adjacent, then the total angle at I between C and G is (x -1) + 2x = 3x -1. If this is part of a straight line, then 3x -1 = 180°, so 3x = 181, x = 60.333... Not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle C-I-D and angle B-I-G are supplementary, then x -1 + 2x = 180 => 3x = 181 => x = 60.333, same as before.

Still not matching options. 

Another idea: Perhaps angle I-G-B is equal to angle B-C-I? Let's say angle I-G-B = x -1. Then from the equation:

(x +10) + (x -1) = 180 => 2x +9 = 180 => 2x = 171 => x = 85.5. Not an option.

Or angle I-G-B = angle D-B-F = x -1. Then:

(x +10) + (x -1) = 180 => 2x +9 = 180 => x = 85.5. Same result.

Still no match.

Wait, what if angle I-G-B is equal to angle BDI = 101°? Then:

(x +10) + 101 = 180 => x +111 = 180 => x = 69. Close to option A (68), but not exact. 

If x = 69, then let's check other equations.

angle D-B-F = 68°

angle B-C-I = 68°

angle B-I-G = 2*69 = 138°

angle I-G-B = 180 - (x +10) = 180 - 79 = 101°

In triangle BGI: 138 + 101 + angle at B = 180 => angle at B = 180 - 138 - 101 = -59°, invalid.

No good. 

Alternatively, if angle I-G-B = 101°, then x +10 + 101 = 180 => x = 69. Still invalid.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in my understanding of the diagram. Perhaps the key is to use the measure of angle BDI = 101° and the congruent angles.

We know that angle BDI = 101°, which is part of triangle BDI. Also, angle D-B-F = x -1. If these are related through some triangle or line.

Let me consider triangle DIF or something. Wait, if line FI is connected, but I don't have info on that.

Wait, from the beginning, we have angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, so E-D-I are colinear. So line EI passes through D. Also, line DB is connected to B. So at point D, we have lines DE, DB, and DI. 

At point D, angle between DE and DB is 79°, and angle between DB and DI is 101°. So total angle at D between DE and DI is 79 + 101 = 180°, which means that DE and DI are in a straight line, confirming that E-D-I are colinear. 

Now, let's consider line DI. Since FB || CI, and line DI intersects them at B and I, respectively. So, as before, angle D-B-F = x -1 is equal to angle C-I-D = x -1. 

Now, let's look at triangle CIDI. At point I, angle C-I-D = x -1, at point D, angle C-D-I = ? Let's say angle at D is angle C-D-I = a. At point C, angle D-C-I = b. So in triangle CIDI, a + b + (x -1) = 180. 

But what is a and b?

At point D, angle C-D-I is part of angle BDI = 101°. Since line DC is connected to D, and line DI is connected, then angle between DC and DI is part of angle BDI. So angle C-D-I + angle B-D-C = 101°. 

But angle B-D-C is part of triangle BDC. Without knowing more, it's hard to say. 

However, if we can relate angle B-D-C to other angles. For example, angle B-C-I = x -1. If line CB is connected, then angle B-C-I is part of triangle BCI. 

Let me assume that line CB is connected, making triangle BCI. In triangle BCI, we have angle at C: x -1, and angle at I: x -1 (from parallel lines). So, in triangle BCI, two angles are x -1, making it an isosceles triangle with sides BC = CI. 

But without knowing side lengths, this might not help. 

However, in triangle BCI, the third angle at B is 180 - 2(x -1). So angle at B is 180 - 2x + 2. 

But angle at B in triangle BCI is angle C-B-I. If this is related to other angles at point B, like angle D-B-F = x -1. If these are supplementary, then:

angle C-B-I + angle D-B-F = 180°

So:

[180 - 2x + 2] + (x -1) = 180

=> 182 - 2x + x -1 = 180

=> 181 - x = 180

=> x = 1

Which is not an option. So this is invalid.

But this suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Let me try another approach. Since angle BDI = 101°, and angle BDI is at D between B and I. If line DC is connected, then angle between DC and DI is part of this 101°. Let's say angle C-D-I = a, and angle B-D-C = 101 - a.

But angle B-D-C is part of triangle BDC. If we can find this angle.

But without more info, it's hard. 

Let me try to use the fact that angle B-C-I = x -1. If line CB is connected, then in triangle BCI, as before, angle at B is 180 - 2(x -1). This angle at B is angle C-B-I. If this is related to angle D-B-F = x -1, and if they are supplementary, then:

angle C-B-I + angle D-B-F = 180

So:

[180 - 2x + 2] + (x -1) = 180

As before, leading to x = 1, which is invalid.

This suggests that there's a missing piece of information or a misinterpretation of the diagram.

Let me go back to the initial equations and see if I missed anything.

We have:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,I)), 101

Which is angle BDI = 101°.

Also, from the first equation, angle EDB = 79°, angle BDI = 101°, so E-D-I are colinear.

Also, angle D-B-F = x -1, and it's congruent to angle B-C-I = x -1.

And from the parallel lines, angle C-I-D = x -1.

Now, let's consider triangle BDI. We know angle at D is 101°, and we need to find other angles. Let's assume that angle at B is angle D-B-I, and at I is angle B-I-D.

Let me denote angle D-B-I as y and angle B-I-D as z. So:

y + z + 101 = 180 => y + z = 79°.

Now, if we can find y or z in terms of x.

From the parallel lines, angle D-B-F = x -1. If line BF is connected to F, and line BI is connected to I, then if F, B, I are colinear, then angle D-B-F = angle D-B-I = y. Thus, y = x -1.

Then, from y + z = 79°, we have z = 79 - y = 79 - (x -1) = 80 - x.

But z is angle B-I-D, which is at point I between B and D. Earlier, we have angle C-I-D = x -1. If these are adjacent, then angle at I between C and B is (x -1) + z = x -1 + 80 - x = 79°. 

Now, this angle at I between C and B is 79°, which might be related to other angles. For example, if this angle is part of triangle BCI or something.

In triangle BCI, we have angle at C: x -1, angle at I: 79°, so the third angle at B is 180 - (x -1) - 79 = 101 - x. 

But this angle at B is angle C-B-I, which we previously assumed to be y = x -1. So:

101 - x = x -1

=> 101 + 1 = 2x

=> 102 = 2x

=> x = 51. Not an option.

But this is close to option A (68), but not quite. 

However, this suggests x = 51, which is not an option. But maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck:

If angle at I between C and B is 79°, then in triangle BCI, angles are:

At C: x -1

At I: 79°

At B: 180 - (x -1) - 79 = 180 - x + 1 - 79 = 102 - x.

If this angle at B (102 - x) is equal to angle D-B-I = y = x -1, then:

102 - x = x -1

=> 103 = 2x

=> x = 51.5, still not an option.

But this suggests x = 51.5, which is not an option. 

But let's assume that this angle at B (102 - x) is related to angle B-I-G = 2x. If they are supplementary, then:

102 - x + 2x = 180

=> 102 + x = 180

=> x = 78.

Ah! This gives x = 78, which is option B!

Let me verify this:

If x = 78, then:

angle D-B-F = x -1 = 77°

angle B-C-I = 77°

angle BDI = 101°

angle at I between C and B is 79° (from earlier calculation)

In triangle BCI, angle at B is 102 - x = 102 - 78 = 24°

If this angle at B (24°) is supplementary to angle B-I-G = 2x = 156°, then 24 + 156 = 180°, which is true!

So this works!

Let me retrace:

1. Assume that angle D-B-F = angle D-B-I = y = x -1 (assuming F, B, I are colinear).

2. In triangle BDI, y + z = 79°, so z = 80 - x.

3. Angle at I between C and B is x -1 (from parallel lines) + z = x -1 + 80 - x = 79°.

4. In triangle BCI, angles are x -1 (at C), 79° (at I), and 102 - x (at B).

5. If angle at B in triangle BCI (102 - x) is supplementary to angle B-I-G (2x), then:

102 - x + 2x = 180 => x = 78.

This matches option B (78).

Let me check if this satisfies all conditions.

With x = 78:

- angle D-B-F = 77°

- angle B-C-I = 77°

- angle H-C-I = 78
