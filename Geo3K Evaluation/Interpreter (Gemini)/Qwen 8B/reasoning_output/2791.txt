MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the value of 'a' given these constraints. So, we have points F, G, H, K, J all lying on a circle A. Wait, no—actually, points G, H, K, J lie on circle A? Let me check again. The problem says:

- PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(A)) → G is on circle A.
- Similarly for H, K, J. So those four points are on the same circle. And point F is just another point, maybe outside the circle?

Then there are lines FH and FJ. Also, both lines FH and FJ are secants of circle A. That means each line passes through the circle, intersecting it at two points. For line FH, since G is on the circle and H is also on the circle, then line FH would pass through G and H? Wait, but if G and H are both on the circle, then line GH is a chord of the circle. But line FH connects F to H. Wait, but the problem states that line FH is a secant of circle A. So that implies that line FH intersects the circle at two points. Since H is already on the circle, so the line FH must pass through another point on the circle. But wait, point G is on the circle as well. Is G on line FH? Because if line FH goes through G and H, which are both on the circle, then yes. So line FH passes through G and H, making them intersection points. Similarly, line FJ passes through K and J because they're on the circle.

So, the setup seems like F is outside the circle, and lines FGH and FJK are secants. Wait, but the problem mentions Line(F,H) and Line(F,J). Let me parse the given lengths:

- Length of FG is 18. So FG is part of line FH. Since G and H are on the circle, and line FH passes through G and H. Therefore, FG is the segment from F to G, and then GH is from G to H. Then FH is FG + GH. Which matches the equations given:

They say Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,H)), Add(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), LengthOf(Line(G,H)))). So FH = FG + GH. Given FG=18, GH=42, so FH should be 18+42=60.

Similarly, for the other secant line FJ. It has FK=15, and KJ=a. So FJ = FK + KJ = 15 + a. 

Now, there's another equation given: Mul(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), LengthOf(Line(F,H))) equals Mul(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(F,J))). So (FG * FH) = (FK * FJ).

We can plug in the known values here. FG is 18, FH is 60, FK is 15, FJ is 15 + a.

Therefore, 18*60 = 15*(15 + a)

Let me compute left side: 18*60. Well, 18*60 is 1080.

Right side: 15*(15 + a) = 15*15 + 15a = 225 + 15a.

Set equal: 1080 = 225 + 15a

Subtract 225 from both sides: 1080 - 225 = 15a → 855 = 15a → a = 855 / 15 = 57.

Wait, 15*57 is 855? Let me check: 15*50=750, 15*7=105; total 750+105=855. Yes. So a=57. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 57. So the answer should be D.

But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key idea here is using the power of a point theorem. When a line from a point outside a circle intersects the circle at two points, the product of the distances from the external point to each intersection point is equal for any two secants. In this case, for point F, the two secants are FH and FJ. So Power of a Point tells us that FG * FH = FK * FJ. Which is exactly the equation given. Therefore, solving gives a=57. Hence, answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ a $, we analyze the geometric configuration involving a circle and two secants emanating from an external point $ F $. The key insight lies in applying the **Power of a Point Theorem**, which states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of any two secants drawn from that point to the circle are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup

Given:
- Points $ G, H, K, J $ lie on circle $ A $.
- Lines $ \overline{FH} $ and $ \overline{FJ} $ are **secants** of the circle.
- From the data:
  - $ FG = 18 $
  - $ GH = 42 $ → So $ FH = FG + GH = 18 + 42 = 60 $
  - $ FK = 15 $
  - $ KJ = a $ → So $ FJ = FK + KJ = 15 + a $

---

### Step 2: Apply the Power of a Point Theorem

According to the Power of a Point Theorem:

$$
FG \cdot FH = FK \cdot FJ
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
18 \cdot 60 = 15 \cdot (15 + a)
$$

Compute left-hand side:

$$
18 \cdot 60 = 1080
$$

So,

$$
1080 = 15(15 + a)
$$

Divide both sides by 15:

$$
\frac{1080}{15} = 15 + a \Rightarrow 72 = 15 + a
$$

Solve for $ a $:

$$
a = 72 - 15 = 57
$$

---

### Final Answer

The value of $ a $ is **57**.

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
