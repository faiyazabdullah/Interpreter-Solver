QUESTION:
Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. Find O X.

CHOICES:
A. 5
B. 12
C. 13
D. 26

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with radius 13 inches. There's a chord CD that's 24 inches long, and radius OB is perpendicular to this chord. We need to find the length of OX, where X is the intersection point of OB and CD. Also, there's some triangle stuff mentioned involving points O, C, X, and it's a right triangle. Hmm.

First, I remember that when a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Wait, so since OB is a radius and it's perpendicular to CD, then OB should intersect CD at its midpoint. But wait, the problem says that X is the midpoint of CD because it mentions IsMidpointOf(X, Line(C,D)). So X is the midpoint of CD. That makes sense because the perpendicular from the center to a chord always bisects the chord. Therefore, CX would be half of CD. Since CD is 24 inches, CX should be 12 inches. So CX = 12.

Now, looking at triangle OCX. The problem states that triangle OXC is a right triangle with the right angle at X. Wait, the question says RightAngle(Angle(O,X,C)), meaning the right angle is at X between O, X, and C. So triangle OXC has a right angle at X. Then, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse (which would be OC) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (OX and XC). 

We know OC is a radius of the circle, which is given as 13 inches. And we just found out that XC is 12 inches. Let me plug these into the equation:

OC² = OX² + XC²  
So, 13² = OX² + 12²  
Calculating that: 169 = OX² + 144  
Subtracting 144 from both sides: OX² = 169 - 144 = 25  
Taking the square root: OX = √25 = 5 inches. 

Wait, but let me check if I got the right triangle correctly. The problem says Right(Triangle(O,C,X)) and RightAngle(Angle(O,X,C)). So the right angle is at X, making OX and XC the legs, and OC the hypotenuse. Yes, that seems right. So OX squared plus XC squared equals OC squared. Which gives OX = 5. 

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 5. So the answer should be A. But let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another way to think about this is using the formula for the distance from the center to the chord. The formula is d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord, r is the radius, and l is the length of the chord. Wait, but here, OB is the radius perpendicular to CD, so OB is the distance from O to CD. Wait, but OB is a radius, which is 13, but the distance from O to CD is actually the length of the segment from O to X, since X is the midpoint. Wait, no. Because OB is a radius, but OB is perpendicular to CD. However, X is the midpoint of CD, so the line OB passes through X? Wait, the problem says IntersectAt(Line(O,B), Line(C,D), Line(O,X), Point(X)). So line OB intersects CD at X. Therefore, OX is part of OB. Wait, but OB is a radius. So OX is the length from O to X along the radius OB. But since X is the midpoint of CD, then OX is the distance from the center to the chord CD. 

But earlier, I used the Pythagorean theorem on triangle OXC, assuming OX and XC are legs. But maybe I can also use the formula for the distance from the center to the chord. The formula is d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)^2). Here, the chord length l is 24, so half-length is 12. Then, d = sqrt(13² - 12²) = sqrt(169 - 144) = sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, OX is 5. So that confirms my previous calculation. Thus, the answer is 5, which is option A. 

I don't see any mistakes here. Both methods give OX = 5. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ OX $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Key Geometric Relationships**

- **Circle(O)**: Centered at point $ O $, with radius 13 inches.
- **Chord CD**: Has a total length of 24 inches, and lies horizontally across the circle.
- **Radii OB and OC**: These are radii of the circle, each measuring 13 inches, and they are perpendicular to chord CD.
- **Intersection Point X**: Lies at the intersection of the perpendicular radius $ OB $ and the chord $ CD $. It is explicitly stated that $ X $ is the **midpoint** of chord $ CD $, and it forms the vertex of triangle $ \triangle OXC $, where $ \angle OXC $ is a right angle.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Perpendicular Chord Theorem**

When a **radius is perpendicular to a chord**, it **bisects the chord**. This means that:
$$
CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ inches}
$$

Also, since $ X $ lies on the radius $ OB $, the segment $ OX $ represents the **distance from the center of the circle to the chord**.

---

### **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem in Triangle $ \triangle OXC $**

Given:
- $ OC = 13 $ inches (radius),
- $ CX = 12 $ inches,
- $ \angle OXC = 90^\circ $,

Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:
$$
OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2 \\
\Rightarrow 13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2 \\
\Rightarrow 169 = OX^2 + 144 \\
\Rightarrow OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25 \\
\Rightarrow OX = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

The length of $ OX $ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{5}
$$

This corresponds to **Option A**.

---
