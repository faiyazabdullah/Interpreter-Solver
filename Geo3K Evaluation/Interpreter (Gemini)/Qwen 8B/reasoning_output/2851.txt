MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see here. The problem is about finding the measure of angle A in a triangle where angles B and C are given as 35 degrees and 52 degrees respectively. Wait, let me check again.

The problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(C)) equals 52, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) equals 35, and we need to find MeasureOf(Angle(A)), which is denoted as x. Also, there's a SumOf constraint that says the sum of angles A, B, and C is 180 degrees. 

So, since the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees, right? That's a fundamental theorem in geometry. So, if I have angles B and C given, then angle A can be found by subtracting their measures from 180.

Let me write that down. Let me denote:

Angle A = x  
Angle B = 35°  
Angle C = 52°  

Then according to the triangle angle sum theorem:

x + 35 + 52 = 180

Adding 35 and 52 first. Let me compute that. 35 plus 52... 35+50 is 85, plus 2 more is 87. So total of angles B and C is 87 degrees. Therefore:

x + 87 = 180

Subtracting 87 from both sides gives x = 180 - 87. Let me calculate that. 180 minus 80 is 100, minus 7 more would be 93. So x equals 93 degrees?

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 93. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might make arithmetic errors.

35 + 52: 35 + 50 = 85, then add 2 more: 87. Correct. Then 180 - 87: 180 - 80 is 100, then subtract 7 more: 93. Yes, that seems right. So x is 93 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be D.

But let me check again if I mixed up the angles. The problem mentions Angle(B) is 35, Angle(C) is 52. So yes, adding those two gives 87. Subtract from 180 gives 93. So answer D. 

Looking at the options: A is 35, B is 52, C is 77, D is 93. So D is the correct answer. I don't think I made a mistake here. The key was remembering that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180, then plugging in the known values and solving for x. Yep, that makes sense. So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the measure of **Angle(A)** in the given triangle, we apply the **Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**. This theorem states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always equal to $ 180^\circ $.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

We are given:
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle B ) = 35^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle C ) = 52^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle A ) = x $

Using the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem:

$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
x + 35 + 52 = 180
$$

Now simplify:

$$
x + 87 = 180
$$

Solving for $ x $:

$$
x = 180 - 87 = 93
$$

---

### Conclusion:

Thus, the measure of $ \angle A $ (denoted as $ x $) is $ 93^\circ $. Among the given answer choices, only **Option D** corresponds to this result.
