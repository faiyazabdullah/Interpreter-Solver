MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle RST. The problem gives several constraints. Let me list them out first to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, there's a triangle with points R, S, and T. Then there are lines connecting each pair: RS, RT, and ST. There's also mention of angles at point R, specifically angle R, which I think refers to angle RST? Wait, no. Wait, the notation might be important here. In angle notation, Angle(R) could mean angle at point R, but the way it's written as Angle(R,S,T) probably means the angle at point S between points R, S, T. Wait, standard notation for angle ABC is the angle at point B. So Angle(R,S,T) would be the angle at point S, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So that would be angle RST. Similarly, Angle(R,T,S) would be the angle at point T, so angle RTS.

Wait, the problem says:

Angle(R)
Angle(R,S,T)
Angle(R,T,S)

So Angle(R) is just angle at R? But in triangles, angles are usually denoted by three points. Maybe Angle(R) here refers to the angle at R, which would be angle SRT? Or maybe it's a typo? Hmm. Wait, the problem statement may need careful parsing.

But then there's Isosceles(Triangle(R,S,T)). So triangle RST is isosceles. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(R,T))). So sides RS and RT are equal. Therefore, triangle RST has two equal sides: RS = RT. That makes it an isosceles triangle with base ST and equal sides RS and RT. Therefore, the base angles at S and T should be equal. Wait, but wait—wait, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Since RS and RT are equal, then the angles opposite them would be angles at T and S respectively? Wait, side RS is opposite angle T, and side RT is opposite angle S. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle RST, side opposite angle R is ST, side opposite angle S is RT, and side opposite angle T is RS. So since RS equals RT, then their opposite angles are equal. So angle T (opposite RS) equals angle S (opposite RT). Wait, that would mean angles at S and T are equal? Wait, but the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R)), 70), so angle at R is 70 degrees. Also, Equals(MeasureOf(AAngle(R,S,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(R,T,S))). So angle at S (which is angle RST?) and angle at T (angle RTS) are equal. Which matches with the triangle being isosceles with RS=RT, making angles at S and T equal. 

So the triangle has angles: at R is 70 degrees, and angles at S and T are equal. Also, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. So angle R + angle S + angle T = 180. Given that angle R is 70, and angle S = angle T, then:

70 + 2x = 180 => 2x = 110 => x = 55. So angles at S and T are 55 degrees each. But wait, the question asks for measure of angle RST. Wait, angle RST is the angle at point S, which is one of the equal angles. So that would be 55 degrees. So the answer would be option A, 55.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me re-express everything.

Given triangle RST. It's isosceles with RS = RT. Therefore, the legs are RS and RT, so the base is ST. Therefore, the base angles are at S and T. Wait, no. Wait, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. If RS = RT, then those sides are adjacent to angle R. Wait, RS and RT are the two equal sides meeting at R. Therefore, the apex is at R, and the base is ST. Therefore, the base angles are at S and T. Therefore, angles at S and T are equal. So angle S (at S) and angle T (at T) are equal. Therefore, angle R is 70 degrees, so angles at S and T add up to 110, so each is 55. Therefore, angle RST is angle at S, which is 55 degrees. So answer A.

But let me check the problem again to make sure I didn't misread.

The problem says:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R)), 70). So angle at R is 70 degrees. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(R,T,S))). So angle(R,S,T) is angle at S, because the middle letter is S. So that's angle RST. Angle(R,T,S) is angle at T, which is angle RTS. These two are equal. Therefore, angles at S and T are equal. Hence, as before, 70 + 2x = 180 → x = 55. Therefore, angle RST is 55 degrees. So answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include A.55, which is option A. So the answer should be A. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the labeling wrong. Suppose angle(R,S,T) is angle at S, yes. So angle RST. So angle at S is equal to angle at T. Therefore, angle at S is 55. So the answer is 55. So answer A. Yes.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
