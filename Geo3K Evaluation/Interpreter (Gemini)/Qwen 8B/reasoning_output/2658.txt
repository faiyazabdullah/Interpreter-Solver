MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me list out the constraints again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have a circle G, points E, B, F, and another point G (wait, the same label for the circle and a point? That might be confusing. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

Wait, the first line says "Circle(G)" and then later mentions Point(G). So maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps it's intended that the circle is named G, and there's also a point labeled G? Hmm. But in the problem, they mention Line(E,B), Line(E,F), Tangent(Line(E,B), Circle(G)), Secant(Line(E,F), Circle(G)). Then there's PointLiesOnCircle(B,Circle(G)) and PointLiesOnCircle(F,Circle(G)). Also, IsRadiusOf(Line(F,G), Circle(G)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(G,B), Circle(G)). And Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), LengthOf(Line(G,B))). So, seems like there's a point G which is on the circle? Or is the circle named G?

Wait, the initial part says "Circle(G)", so the circle is named G. Then there's a point called G as well? Because later, they refer to Line(F,G) and Line(G,B). So, yes, there is a point G, which is the center of the circle? Because the radius would be from the center to a point on the circle. Wait, but the problem states that IsRadiusOf(Line(F,G), Circle(G)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(G,B), Circle(G)). So, that suggests that lines FG and GB are radii of circle G. Therefore, point G must be the center of the circle. Because the radius connects the center to a point on the circle. Therefore, points B and F lie on the circle, and G is the center. Therefore, BG and FG are radii, meaning that B and F are points on the circle, and G is the center. 

So, the circle has center G, and points B and F are on the circle. Also, Line(E,B) is tangent to the circle, so EB is tangent to the circle at point B. Similarly, Line(E,F) is a secant, passing through the circle, intersecting it at two points. However, since F is on the circle, then line EF passes through F and intersects the circle again somewhere else? Or maybe only at F? Wait, but the problem says that Line(E,F) is a secant, which usually means it intersects the circle at two distinct points. Since F is already on the circle, then the line EF must pass through another intersection point. But the problem also says that PointLiesOnCircle(B,Circle(G)) and PointLiesOnCircle(F,Circle(G)), so both B and F are on the circle. Therefore, line EF starts at E, goes through F (which is on the circle), and since it's a secant, it should intersect the circle at another point. Wait, unless F is the only intersection point? But that can't be because a secant requires two points. Therefore, line EF must pass through F and another point on the circle. However, since B is also on the circle, maybe line EF passes through B? Wait, no, because line EB is tangent at B, so line EB touches the circle only at B. Therefore, line EF cannot pass through B unless E is outside the circle and line EF passes through F and another point. Maybe there's another intersection point?

But let's proceed step by step.

Given that EB is tangent to the circle at B. Since EB is tangent, then by the tangent-secant theorem, we know that the square of the length of the tangent segment equals the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external part. Wait, but in this case, line EF is a secant. Wait, but maybe we need to use power of a point here.

Let me recall the Power of a Point Theorem. If a line through E intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, then EP * EQ = (length of tangent from E to circle)^2. In our case, line EF is a secant that passes through F (on the circle) and maybe another point. But since line EF is a secant, and F is on the circle, then the other intersection point could be another point, say, let's call it H. But since B is on the circle and line EB is tangent at B, then E lies outside the circle. Therefore, the power of point E with respect to circle G is equal to the square of the tangent length EB^2. Also, since line EF is a secant passing through F and H, then power of E is also equal to EF * EH. So, we have:

EB² = EF * EH

But we need to find EH. However, we might need more relations here.

Additionally, given that line EB is tangent at B, and line BG is perpendicular to EB, since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact. Therefore, angle at B between EB and BG is 90 degrees. So triangle EBG is right-angled at B.

Also, given that EG is the hypotenuse of triangle EBG, since BG is radius, and BE is tangent. So, using Pythagoras:

EG² = EB² + BG²

But BG is the radius, which is equal to x, since it's stated that Length(FG) = Length(GB) = x. Therefore, BG = x, and FG = x as well. Therefore, EG² = EB² + x².

Now, let's note down the known values. Given that EB = 16, EF = 12. We need to find x.

From the Power of a Point theorem, since line EF is a secant passing through F and another point H, then:

Power of E = EF * EH = EB² = 16² = 256

But EF is 12, so 12 * EH = 256 => EH = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.333...

But EH is the length from E to H, where H is the second intersection point of line EF with the circle. However, since F is on the circle, and assuming that the line passes through F and H, then EH = EF + FH? Wait, depends on the position of H relative to E and F. If E is outside the circle, and line EF passes through F (on the circle) and extends to another point H inside the circle? No, wait. Wait, when you have a secant, the points are ordered such that E is outside, then the secant passes through the circle at two points. So, starting from E, going towards the circle, it first meets the circle at some point, then exits. Wait, but in our case, the line EF starts at E, goes through F (which is on the circle), so F is one intersection point. Then the other intersection point would be another point. Wait, but how do we determine where?

Alternatively, maybe the line EF intersects the circle at F and another point, say, let's call it K. So, the power of point E gives us that EF * EK = EB². But since F is on the line, and K is another intersection point, then depending on direction, EK would be the distance from E to K. But if K is between E and F, then EK would be shorter than EF. Alternatively, if K is beyond F from E, then EK would be longer than EF. However, without knowing the exact configuration, we need to figure out based on the given data.

But perhaps there's another way. Let's think about coordinates. Let me try setting up coordinate axes to model this.

Since EB is tangent to the circle at B, and BG is perpendicular to EB. Let me place point B at (0,0) for simplicity. Let me assume that EB is along the x-axis. Since BG is perpendicular to EB, then BG would be vertical. Wait, if EB is horizontal, then BG is vertical. Suppose point B is at (0,0). Then, since EB is tangent at B, and BG is the radius, so G is somewhere along the vertical line through B. Let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Let’s define coordinates:

Let’s set point B at (0,0). Since EB is tangent at B, and BG is perpendicular to EB. Let’s suppose that EB is horizontal. Then, the tangent line EB is horizontal, so the slope of EB is zero. Hence, the radius BG must be vertical. Therefore, point G lies along the y-axis. Let me denote G as (0, r), where r is the radius x. Wait, but earlier we had that FG and GB are radii, so their lengths are equal to x. Therefore, GB = x, so the distance from G to B is x. Since B is at (0,0) and G is at (0, r), then the distance BG is |r|, so r = x. Therefore, coordinates of G are (0, x).

Then, point F is another point on the circle. Since FG is also a radius, so the distance from F to G is x. So, coordinates of F satisfy the equation that the distance from F to G (0, x) is x. Also, since F lies on the circle centered at G (0, x) with radius x. Therefore, coordinates of F satisfy:

(x_F - 0)^2 + (y_F - x)^2 = x^2.

Additionally, since line EF is a secant passing through F. Let me consider coordinates of E. Since EB is tangent at B, and B is at (0,0), and E is a point outside the circle. Since EB is tangent, and we've placed B at (0,0), and EB is horizontal. Let me assume that E is located to the left of B along the x-axis. Let me denote E as (-a, 0), where a > 0. Then, the length of EB is the distance from E(-a, 0) to B(0,0), which is sqrt((a)^2 + 0) = a. According to the problem, this length is 16, so a = 16. Therefore, E is at (-16, 0).

Now, line EF connects E(-16, 0) to F, which is a point on the circle. Let me find coordinates of F. Since F is on the circle, and also line EF has length 12. Wait, the problem states that the length of EF is 12. Wait, the problem says "Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), 12)". So, the distance from E to F is 12. Therefore, distance between E(-16, 0) and F(x_F, y_F) is 12. Additionally, F lies on the circle centered at G(0, x) with radius x. So:

Equation 1: (x_F)^2 + (y_F - x)^2 = x^2.

Equation 2: (x_F + 16)^2 + (y_F - 0)^2 = 12^2 = 144.

So we have these two equations. Let me expand Equation 1:

x_F² + (y_F - x)^2 = x² → x_F² + y_F² - 2xy_F + x² = x² → x_F² + y_F² - 2xy_F = 0.

Equation 2 expands to:

(x_F + 16)^2 + y_F² = 144 → x_F² + 32x_F + 256 + y_F² = 144 → x_F² + y_F² + 32x_F + 256 = 144 → x_F² + y_F² + 32x_F = -112.

Now, from Equation 1, we can express x_F² + y_F² = 2xy_F. Substitute into Equation 2:

2xy_F + 32x_F = -112 → 2xy_F = -112 -32x_F → y_F = (-112 -32x_F)/(2x) = (-56 -16x_F)/x.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for E, B, G, and F lies on the circle. Also, since line EF is a secant, and we can relate it via power of a point.

Earlier, we considered Power of a Point E with respect to circle G: EB² = EF * EH, where EH is the entire secant length. But since line EF intersects the circle at F and another point, say H. Wait, but in our setup, line EF starts at E, goes through F, which is on the circle. Depending on the direction, H could be another intersection point. However, since E is outside the circle, the line EF passes through the circle twice: once entering and once exiting. But since F is one point, then the other intersection point could be another point. However, given that line EF is a secant, and F is one of the intersections, then the power of point E is EF * EK, where K is the other intersection. Wait, but depending on whether F is closer to E or further away.

Wait, but if E is outside the circle, and line EF passes through F (on the circle), then the other intersection point would be on the extension of EF beyond F. Wait, no. If E is outside, then the line EF would enter the circle at one point, exit at another. If F is on the circle, then either F is the entry point or the exit point. But since line EF is a secant, which implies two intersection points. If E is outside, then the line EF must pass through two points on the circle. So, if F is one of them, then the other point is another point. Let me denote the two intersection points as F and H. Then, according to power of a point, EF * EH = EB². But depending on whether H is between E and F or beyond F.

If F is the farther intersection point from E, then the length from E to F would be the whole secant length, and the other intersection point would be between E and F. Wait, but that's not possible because if you go from E towards F, you first meet the circle at H, then continue to F. Wait, no—if E is outside, and the line passes through F (on the circle), then depending on direction, the other intersection could be between E and F or beyond F.

But since F is on the line EF, and the line passes through the circle at two points. Let me think of E outside the circle, drawing a line that passes through F (on the circle). Then, the line would intersect the circle at another point. If F is the point closer to E, then the other intersection point is further away from E. But in that case, the power of point E would be EF * (EF + FH) where FH is the distance from F to the other intersection. Wait, actually, the formula is that if a secant passes through E and intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then EX * EY = power of E. Here, if the line passes through E, then E---X---Y, with X and Y being the two points. So, if F is one of them, say, X=F, and Y=another point, then EX * EY = EF * EY. Wait, but in our case, the line EF starts at E, goes through F, then continues. If F is the first intersection point (closer to E), then the other intersection point is beyond F. Therefore, the power of point E is EF * (EF + FY) ? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Suppose the line passes through E, then intersects the circle at X and Y. Then, the power of E is EX * EY. If E is outside, then EX and EY are both positive distances from E to each intersection point. For example, if E is outside, and the line passes through X and Y (with X closer to E), then EX is the distance from E to X, and EY is the distance from E to Y. Therefore, if F is one of those points, say X=F, then the power is EF * EY. But in our case, we have line EF, which is a secant, so it must pass through two points. One is F, and the other is another point. Let me call that point H. So, power of E is EF * EH, where EF is the distance from E to F, and EH is the distance from E to H. However, depending on the order of the points, this may vary.

But since we know that F is on the circle, then H is another point. However, given that the problem says that line EF is a secant, so H is another intersection point. Now, let's suppose that H is between E and F. Then, the power of E would be EH * EF, where EH < EF. But since we have that the power of E is also equal to EB² = 256. But we know EF = 12, so if H is between E and F, then EH * EF = 256. But then, since EH < EF, then EH = 256 / EF = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33. But EF is 12, which is less than 64/3 (~21.33), which would imply that EH > EF, contradicting the assumption that H is between E and F. Therefore, this suggests that H is beyond F from E. Therefore, the power of E is EF * (EF + FH) ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If E is outside, and the line passes through E, then enters the circle at H, exits at F. So, the points are ordered as E --- H ---- F. Then, the power of E is EH * EF, where EH is the distance from E to H, and EF is the distance from E to F. Wait, no. Actually, the power is EH * EF, but since H is between E and F, then EH is the distance from E to H, and HF is the distance from H to F. Then, the total length from E to F is EH + HF. But the power of point E is EH * (EH + HF). Wait, no, the standard formula is that if the secant passes through E and intersects the circle at X and Y, then EX * EY = power. So, if the points are ordered E---X---Y, then EX is the distance from E to X, and EY is the distance from E to Y. Thus, EX * EY = power. In our case, if the points are E---H----F, then EX = EH and EY = EF. So, EH * EF = power. Wait, but that would mean that if the line passes through H and F, then EH * EF = power. However, in reality, the power is equal to the square of the tangent, so EH * EF = EB² = 256. Given that EF = 12, then EH = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33. Which would mean that the distance from E to H is 64/3, and from E to F is 12. But since H is between E and F, then EF = EH + HF → 12 = 64/3 + HF → HF = 12 - 64/3 = (36/3 - 64/3) = -28/3. Negative value, which is impossible. Therefore, contradiction. This suggests that my assumption about the order of points is wrong.

Therefore, the correct ordering must be that E---F----H, with F and H being the two intersection points. So, the line passes through E, then goes through F (on the circle), then continues to H, which is another intersection point. Therefore, the power of E is EF * EH, where EF is the distance from E to F, and EH is the distance from E to H. Wait, no—since the points are E---F---H, then the power is EF * EH, but EH would be the distance from E to H, which is EF + FH. But the power is also equal to EB² = 256. Therefore:

EF * EH = 256.

But EF is 12, so:

12 * EH = 256 → EH = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33.

Which would mean that the distance from E to H is 64/3, and since F is 12 units from E, then the distance from F to H is EH - EF = 64/3 - 12 = 64/3 - 36/3 = 28/3. So, FH = 28/3.

But how does this help us? Well, we need to relate this to the rest of the problem. Also, remember that F lies on the circle, and H is another point on the circle. Therefore, both F and H are points on the circle, so GH and GF are radii, hence equal to x. Also, we have coordinates for E, B, G, etc., which we started earlier.

Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinates to find relations. Earlier, we had coordinates for E(-16, 0), B(0,0), G(0,x). Let me see if I can find coordinates for F.

We had two equations:

1. From circle: x_F² + (y_F - x)^2 = x².

2. From distance EF: (x_F + 16)^2 + y_F² = 144.

Expanding equation 1:

x_F² + y_F² - 2x y_F + x² = x² → x_F² + y_F² - 2x y_F = 0.

Equation 2: expanding gives:

x_F² + 32x_F + 256 + y_F² = 144 → x_F² + y_F² = -112 -32x_F.

Substituting into equation 1:

(-112 -32x_F) - 2x y_F = 0 → -112 -32x_F - 2x y_F = 0 → 2x y_F = -112 -32x_F → y_F = (-112 -32x_F)/(2x) = (-56 -16x_F)/x.

So, now we have y_F expressed in terms of x_F and x. Also, since F is on the circle, it satisfies equation 1. But we also know that the line EF has length 12, and we also have that the power of point E is 256, which equals EF * EH. But perhaps there's another relation here.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for F, maybe we can find another condition. Also, since line EF is a secant passing through F and H, which are both on the circle. Therefore, H is another intersection point of line EF with the circle. Let me parametrize line EF.

Parametric equations for line EF: Starting at E(-16, 0), going through F(x_F, y_F). Let me write parametric equations for this line. Any point on the line can be written as E + t*(vector EF). Vector EF is (x_F + 16, y_F - 0) = (x_F + 16, y_F). So parametric equations are:

x = -16 + t(x_F + 16)

y = 0 + t(y_F)

For t=0, we get E; for t=1, we get F.

To find other intersection points with the circle, substitute these into the circle equation:

(x)^2 + (y - x)^2 = x^2.

Substitute x and y:

[-16 + t(x_F + 16)]² + [t y_F - x]^2 = x².

This equation should hold for t corresponding to points on the line intersecting the circle. We know that t=1 corresponds to F, which is on the circle. So substituting t=1:

[-16 + (x_F + 16)]² + [y_F - x]^2 = x².

Simplify [-16 + x_F + 16]^2 + [y_F - x]^2 = (x_F)^2 + (y_F - x)^2 = x². Which matches equation 1. So that checks out.

Now, we need to find other solutions for t. Expand the equation:

Let me denote the parametric expressions:

Let me compute the left-hand side:

[ -16 + t(x_F + 16) ]² + [ t y_F - x ]² = x².

Expand term by term:

First term squared: [ -16 + t(x_F + 16) ]² = [ t(x_F + 16) -16 ]² = t²(x_F +16)^2 - 32t(x_F +16) + 256.

Second term squared: [ t y_F - x ]² = t² y_F² - 2tx y_F + x².

Adding both terms:

t²[(x_F +16)^2 + y_F²] - 32t(x_F +16) + 256 - 2tx y_F + x² = x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

t²[(x_F +16)^2 + y_F²] - 32t(x_F +16) + 256 - 2tx y_F = 0.

Now, notice that from equation 2, we have:

(x_F +16)^2 + y_F² = 144. Because that was the expansion of the distance from E to F. So, substituting that into the above expression:

t² * 144 - 32t(x_F +16) + 256 - 2tx y_F = 0.

So:

144 t² - [32(x_F +16) + 2x y_F] t + 256 = 0.

Now, since t=1 is a root (because F is on the line and the circle), we can factor (t - 1) from the quadratic equation. Let me perform polynomial division or use Vieta's formula.

The quadratic equation is 144 t² - [32(x_F +16) + 2x y_F] t + 256 = 0.

Let me denote coefficients as:

A = 144,

B = -[32(x_F +16) + 2x y_F],

C = 256.

We know that one root is t=1, so plugging t=1:

A(1)^2 + B(1) + C = 0 → 144 + B + 256 = 0 → B = -400.

Thus:

-[32(x_F +16) + 2x y_F] = -400 → 32(x_F +16) + 2x y_F = 400.

Divide both sides by 2:

16(x_F +16) + x y_F = 200.

So:

16x_F + 256 + x y_F = 200 → 16x_F + x y_F = -56.

Now, recall from earlier that we had y_F = (-56 -16x_F)/x. Let me substitute that into this equation:

16x_F + x * [ (-56 -16x_F)/x ] = -56.

Simplify:

16x_F + (-56 -16x_F) = -56 → 16x_F -56 -16x_F = -56 → -56 = -56.

Which is always true. Therefore, this doesn't give us new information. It seems like we need another equation to find x.

But we also know that point F lies on the circle. Recall that the circle has center G(0, x) and radius x. So, coordinates of F(x_F, y_F) satisfy:

(x_F)^2 + (y_F - x)^2 = x².

Which we already used earlier. So, perhaps we need to relate this with something else. Let me think about the fact that line EF intersects the circle at F and H, and we have the power of point E: EF * EH = 256.

Earlier, we said that EF = 12, so EH = 256 / 12 = 64/3. Therefore, the distance from E to H is 64/3. But H is another point on the circle. How can we relate this to coordinates?

Since H is another intersection point of line EF with the circle, we can find its coordinates. Since we have parametric equations, and we know that t=1 corresponds to F, and t=t_H corresponds to H. Since the quadratic equation has roots t=1 and t=t_H, then by Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is -B/A.

From before, the quadratic equation is 144 t² - 400 t + 256 = 0 (since we found B=-400). Wait, no, earlier we derived that B = -400 after substitution. So, the quadratic equation becomes:

144t² -400t +256 = 0.

Wait, but earlier steps showed that B = -400. Therefore, the quadratic is:

144t² - 400t + 256 = 0.

Let me check discriminant: D = 400² - 4*144*256.

Calculate D:

400² = 160000

4*144*256 = 4 * 144 * 256

Compute 144*256: 144*256 = 36864

Multiply by 4: 147456

Thus, D = 160000 - 147456 = 12544.

Square root of D: √12544 = 112.

Thus, roots are t = [400 ± 112]/(2*144) = (400 ± 112)/288.

Calculating:

First root: (400 + 112)/288 = 512/288 = 16/9 ≈ 1.777...

Second root: (400 - 112)/288 = 288/288 = 1.

So, the roots are t=1 and t=16/9. So, the parameter t=1 corresponds to F, and t=16/9 corresponds to H. Therefore, the point H is located at t=16/9 along the line EF from E.

Therefore, the distance from E to H is t times the length of vector EF. Wait, no—the parameter t scales the vector EF. Wait, the parametric equations were defined as starting at E and moving along vector EF. So, the length from E to a general point on the line is t multiplied by the length of EF. Wait, no, because the parameter t isn't necessarily normalized. Let me think.

Actually, the parameter t in the parametric equations defines the position along the line. The vector from E to F is (x_F +16, y_F), and the length of this vector is 12 (given). Therefore, the parameter t=1 corresponds to moving 1 unit along the direction of the vector EF, scaled appropriately. Wait, no—it's linear scaling. So, the actual Euclidean distance from E to a point at parameter t is t multiplied by the length of the vector EF. Wait, no, because the vector EF has length 12. So, if t=1, then the distance from E to F is 12. If t=k, then the distance from E to that point is k * |EF|. Wait, no. Because the parametric equations are:

x = -16 + t*(Δx), where Δx = x_F +16.

Similarly for y. So, the scaling factor is arbitrary. The actual distance from E to a general point on the line is not simply t times |EF| unless the parameter t is chosen to represent arc length, which it isn't. Therefore, we need to calculate the distance from E to H.

But since we know that t=16/9 corresponds to point H, then the distance from E to H is t multiplied by the length of the vector EF divided by the magnitude of the vector EF? No, that's not correct. Let me think differently.

The vector from E to F has length 12. The parameter t in the parametric equations represents how far along the vector EF you go from E. However, the actual Euclidean distance from E to H is proportional to t. Specifically, if we move t times the vector EF, then the distance would be t * |EF|. Wait, no. Because the vector EF has length 12, so the parameter t scales the vector. For example, at t=1, we're at F, which is 12 units away from E. At t=2, we'd be 24 units away from E in the same direction. But in our case, the parameter t=16/9 corresponds to point H. So, the distance from E to H is 16/9 times the length of EF, but wait, that would be 16/9 * 12 = 64/3, which matches our previous calculation of EH = 64/3. Yes! Because from the power of a point, we have EH = 64/3. Therefore, the distance from E to H is 64/3, which equals t * |EF|, where t=16/9. So:

Distance EH = t * |EF| = (16/9)*12 = 192/9 = 64/3, which matches.

Now, since point H lies on the circle, and we can find its coordinates. Let me compute coordinates of H.

Using the parametric equations with t=16/9:

x_H = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16)

y_H = 0 + (16/9)y_F

But since H is on the circle centered at G(0, x) with radius x, we have:

x_H² + (y_H - x)^2 = x².

Plugging in x_H and y_H:

[-16 + (16/9)(x_F +16)]² + [(16/9)y_F - x]^2 = x².

This seems complex, but maybe we can simplify it.

Alternatively, since H is on the circle, we can use the fact that GH = x. Coordinates of G are (0, x), so distance from G to H is x. Let me compute GH^2:

GH² = (x_H - 0)^2 + (y_H - x)^2 = x_H² + (y_H - x)^2 = x².

Which is consistent with the circle equation.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since we know that EH = 64/3 and EF = 12, and we have coordinates for E(-16, 0), F(x_F, y_F), H(x_H, y_H), and we have relationships between these variables.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for E, B, G, and F, and we know that BG is a radius, which is x. Earlier, we had BG is the distance from B(0,0) to G(0,x), which is x units. So that's satisfied.

But how do we relate this to find x?

Perhaps we can use the coordinates of F and the fact that FG = x. Since F is on the circle, FG is the distance from F to G(0,x), which is sqrt( (x_F - 0)^2 + (y_F - x)^2 ) = sqrt(x_F² + (y_F - x)^2 ). But this is equal to x, because F is on the circle. So:

sqrt(x_F² + (y_F - x)^2 ) = x → squaring both sides: x_F² + (y_F - x)^2 = x² → which is the same as equation 1. So nothing new.

But we also know that the coordinates of F satisfy the equation from the distance from E to F being 12:

(x_F +16)^2 + y_F^2 = 144.

And from earlier, we had y_F = (-56 -16x_F)/x.

Let me substitute this into the equation:

(x_F +16)^2 + [ (-56 -16x_F)/x ]^2 = 144.

Let me expand this:

(x_F +16)^2 + [ (56 +16x_F)^2 ] / x² = 144.

This looks complicated, but maybe we can find a way to solve for x. Let me denote u = x_F for simplicity.

Then, the equation becomes:

(u +16)^2 + (56 +16u)^2 / x² = 144.

Also, from earlier, we had another equation involving x and u: from the condition that the quadratic equation had roots t=1 and t=16/9, leading to the equation 16u + x y_F = -56, and y_F = (-56 -16u)/x. Wait, but we already used that.

Alternatively, since we have multiple equations, maybe we can combine them.

But perhaps there's another relationship. Remember that line EF has length 12, and we have coordinates for E, F, and H. Also, since H is on the circle, and we can express coordinates of H in terms of x_F and y_F, and then use the fact that GH = x.

But this seems too vague. Let me think differently.

Recall that in triangle EBG, which is right-angled at B, we have:

EG² = EB² + BG² → EG² = 16² + x² = 256 + x².

But EG is also the distance from E(-16, 0) to G(0, x), which is sqrt( (0 - (-16))^2 + (x - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(16² + x²). So, that matches.

Now, what else can we do? Perhaps consider triangle EFG or something else?

Alternatively, since point H is on the circle, and we know EH = 64/3, and we can find the coordinates of H, then use the fact that GH = x.

Coordinates of H: from earlier, x_H = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16), y_H = (16/9)y_F.

So, distance from G(0, x) to H is x:

sqrt( (x_H - 0)^2 + (y_H - x)^2 ) = x → squaring both sides:

x_H² + (y_H - x)^2 = x².

Expand this:

x_H² + y_H² - 2x y_H + x² = x² → x_H² + y_H² - 2x y_H = 0.

Now, substitute x_H and y_H:

x_H = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16) = -16 + (16/9)x_F + (16/9)(16) = (16/9)x_F + (256/9 - 16).

Convert 16 to 144/9: 256/9 - 144/9 = 112/9. So x_H = (16/9)x_F + 112/9.

Similarly, y_H = (16/9)y_F.

So, plug into x_H² + y_H² - 2x y_H = 0:

[ (16/9 x_F + 112/9 ) ]² + [ (16/9 y_F ) ]² - 2x * (16/9 y_F ) = 0.

Factor out 1/9²:

Let me compute each term:

First term: (16x_F + 112)^2 / 81.

Second term: (16y_F)^2 / 81.

Third term: -2x * (16/9 y_F ) = -32x y_F / 9.

So overall:

[(16x_F + 112)^2 + (16y_F)^2 ] / 81 - 32x y_F / 9 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 81 to eliminate denominators:

(16x_F + 112)^2 + (16y_F)^2 - 32x y_F * 9 = 0.

Expand:

(16x_F + 112)^2 + 256 y_F² - 288x y_F = 0.

Now, expand (16x_F + 112)^2:

= 256x_F² + 2*16*112 x_F + 112² = 256x_F² + 3584x_F + 12544.

So, adding 256y_F²:

Total expression becomes:

256x_F² + 3584x_F + 12544 + 256y_F² - 288x y_F = 0.

Group terms:

256(x_F² + y_F²) + 3584x_F + 12544 - 288x y_F = 0.

From earlier, we had from equation 2: x_F² + y_F² = -112 -32x_F.

Substitute this into the equation:

256*(-112 -32x_F) + 3584x_F + 12544 - 288x y_F = 0.

Calculate 256*(-112) = -28672, and 256*(-32x_F) = -8192x_F.

So:

-28672 -8192x_F + 3584x_F + 12544 - 288x y_F = 0.

Combine like terms:

-8192x_F + 3584x_F = -4608x_F.

Constants: -28672 + 12544 = -16128.

So:

-4608x_F - 16128 - 288x y_F = 0.

Divide all terms by -48 to simplify:

-4608 / -48 = 96, -16128 / -48 = 336, -288 / -48 = 6.

So:

96x_F + 336 + 6x y_F = 0 → divide by 6:

16x_F + 56 + x y_F = 0 → 16x_F + x y_F = -56.

Wait, this is the same equation we had earlier: 16x_F + x y_F = -56. Which came from the condition that the quadratic had t=1 as a root. So this brings us back to the same equation, giving no new information. Hence, we need another equation to solve for x.

At this point, I'm stuck trying to derive equations from the given conditions. Perhaps I should revisit the Power of a Point formula and the given equation in the problem statement.

Looking back at the problem, there's a specific equation given:

Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(E,B))), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), Add(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), Mul(2,x))))

Which translates to:

EB² = EF * (EF + 2x)

Wait, the problem says:

Equals(Pow(LengthOf(Line(E,B)),2), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,F)),Add(LengthOf(Line(E,F)),Mul(2,x))))

So, EB² = EF * (EF + 2x). 

Wait, this is a key equation. Let me verify this. The problem states that this equality holds. So, according to the given information, this equation is valid.

Given that, we can plug in the known values:

EB = 16, so EB² = 256.

EF = 12, so:

256 = 12 * (12 + 2x)

Let me solve this equation:

256 = 12*(12 + 2x)

Divide both sides by 12:

256 / 12 = 12 + 2x → Simplify LHS: 64/3 = 12 + 2x.

Subtract 12 from both sides:

64/3 - 12 = 2x → Convert 12 to thirds: 36/3.

64/3 - 36/3 = 28/3 = 2x → x = (28/3)/2 = 14/3.

So x = 14/3, which is approximately 4.666...

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 14/3.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

But let me confirm this with the earlier equations. Because earlier, I couldn't find x due to circular dependencies, but this equation directly provides x.

Where did this equation come from? The problem statement includes this equation as a constraint: "Equals(Pow(LengthOf(Line(E,B)),2), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,F)),Add(LengthOf(Line(E,F)),Mul(2,x))))"

So, this equation is part of the given constraints. Therefore, even though I initially thought the power of a point would involve EF * EH = EB², the problem provides an additional equation that relates EB² to EF * (EF + 2x). This suggests that there's more structure to the problem that I hadn't considered yet.

Let me explain why this equation holds. The problem says that "Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(E,B))), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), Add(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), Mul(2,x))))", which is EB² = EF*(EF + 2x). 

But why is this equation valid? Perhaps it comes from combining the Power of a Point theorem with another geometric property. Let me think.

Previously, we had from Power of a Point: EB² = EF * EH, where EH is the entire secant length. But according to the problem's equation, it's EF*(EF + 2x). So, comparing these:

EF * EH = EF*(EF + 2x) → EH = EF + 2x.

But earlier, we found that EH = 64/3, and EF = 12. So, substituting:

64/3 = 12 + 2x → solving for x gives 14/3, which matches the earlier result.

So, this equation is essentially saying that EH = EF + 2x. Why is EH = EF + 2x?

Maybe because of some geometric property related to the configuration of the points. Let me think about it.

Since line EF is a secant intersecting the circle at F and H, and EH = EF + FH. If we can show that FH = 2x, then EH = EF + FH = EF + 2x. 

But why would FH = 2x? Since F and H are points on the circle, and G is the center. If we can show that FH is the diameter, then FH = 2x. But why would FH be the diameter?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle FGH is equilateral? Not necessarily. Or maybe there's a relation between FH and the radius.

Wait, if we consider the points F and H on the circle, then the distance between F and H is 2x only if FH is the diameter. But why would FH be the diameter? Unless there's some symmetry.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we had that the line EF passes through F and H, with EH = EF + FH. And from the given equation, this equals EF + 2x. So, FH = 2x. Therefore, FH is twice the radius, implying that FH is the diameter of the circle. Hence, FH is the diameter, so F and H are endpoints of a diameter. But why would FH be a diameter?

Because if line EF passes through F and H, and FH is a diameter, then G, the center, lies on the line FH. Since G is the center, and FH is a diameter, then G is the midpoint of FH. Therefore, the midpoint of FH is G. So, coordinates of G would be the average of F and H.

But from earlier, we had coordinates of G as (0, x). Let me see if that aligns.

Assume that FH is a diameter, so midpoint of FH is G(0, x). Therefore, if F is (x_F, y_F), then H is (2*0 - x_F, 2*x - y_F) = (-x_F, 2x - y_F).

But earlier, we found that the coordinates of H are given by:

x_H = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16)

y_H = (16/9)y_F.

But if H is the diametrically opposite point of F, then:

x_H = -x_F, and y_H = 2x - y_F.

Therefore, we can set up equations:

-x_F = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16)

and

2x - y_F = (16/9)y_F.

Let me solve these equations.

First equation:

-x_F = -16 + (16/9)(x_F +16)

Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominator:

-9x_F = -144 + 16(x_F +16)

Expand RHS: -144 + 16x_F + 256 = 16x_F + 112.

So:

-9x_F = 16x_F + 112 → -25x_F = 112 → x_F = -112/25.

Second equation:

2x - y_F = (16/9)y_F → 2x = y_F(16/9 + 1) = y_F(25/9) → y_F = (2x * 9)/25 = (18x)/25.

Now, we have x_F = -112/25 and y_F = 18x/25.

Now, recall that F lies on the circle centered at G(0, x) with radius x. Therefore, the distance from F to G is x. Let's verify this.

Coordinates of F: (-112/25, 18x/25).

Distance from F to G(0, x):

√[ (-112/25 - 0)^2 + (18x/25 - x)^2 ] = √[ (12544/625) + ( (18x/25 - 25x/25 )^2 ) ]

Simplify:

Inside the square root:

12544/625 + (-7x/25)^2 = 12544/625 + 49x²/625 = (12544 + 49x²)/625.

This must equal x², since the distance is x.

So:

(12544 + 49x²)/625 = x² → Multiply both sides by 625:

12544 + 49x² = 625x² → 12544 = 625x² - 49x² = 576x² → x² = 12544 / 576.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 784 / 36 → further divide by 4: 196 / 9.

So x² = 196/9 → x = 14/3 (since x is a length, positive).

Therefore, x = 14/3, which matches our earlier solution from the given equation.

Thus, the correct answer is B: 14/3.

This confirms that using the provided equation in the problem leads directly to x = 14/3, which is option B.

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

#### **Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We are given several geometric elements:

- A **circle** centered at point $ G $, with radius $ x $.
- Points $ B $ and $ F $ lying on the circle.
- Segment $ \overline{EB} $ is **tangent** to the circle at $ B $, and segment $ \overline{EF} $ is a **secant** intersecting the circle at $ F $ and another point $ H $.
- Triangle $ \triangle EBG $ is **right-angled** at $ B $, because the radius $ \overline{BG} $ is perpendicular to the tangent $ \overline{EB} $.
- The **length of $ \overline{EB} $ is 16**, and the **length of $ \overline{EF} $ is 12**.
- The problem provides an important identity:  
  $$
  \text{Length}(\overline{EB})^2 = \text{Length}(\overline{EF}) \times (\text{Length}(\overline{EF}) + 2x)
  $$

---

### **Applying the Given Identity**

We begin by applying the given identity:

$$
\text{Length}(\overline{EB})^2 = \text{Length}(\overline{EF}) \cdot (\text{Length}(\overline{EF}) + 2x)
$$

Substitute known values:

- $ \text{Length}(\overline{EB}) = 16 \Rightarrow \text{Length}(\overline{EB})^2 = 256 $
- $ \text{Length}(\overline{EF}) = 12 $

So,
$$
256 = 12 \cdot (12 + 2x)
$$

Solving for $ x $:

$$
\frac{256}{12} = 12 + 2x \\
\frac{64}{3} = 12 + 2x \\
2x = \frac{64}{3} - 12 = \frac{64 - 36}{3} = \frac{28}{3} \\
x = \frac{14}{3}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

This computation directly yields the value of $ x $. All geometric properties, including the Power of a Point, right-angle at $ B $, and the given identity, support this conclusion.

### **Final Answer**
