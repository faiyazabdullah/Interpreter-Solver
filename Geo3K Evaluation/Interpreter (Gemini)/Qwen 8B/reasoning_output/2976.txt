====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 2 here. So first, I need to parse all these geometric constraints and see how they relate. Let me start by listing out the given information and then work through it step by step.

First, there are several points: A, B, C, D, E, F. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(C,E), Line(A,B), Line(A,F), Line(A,D), Line(B,D), Line(C,D). Also, some angles are mentioned with their measures. 

The key angles given are:

- Measure of Angle(C,A,B) is 22 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(A,C,B) is 23 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(A,D,B) is 32 degrees.
- There's also an angle at A between F and B (Angle(A,F,B)) which equals Angle(C,F,A).
- Additionally, there's a triangle A,B,F and another triangle A,D,F. 
- The point E is collinear with C, F, B, so that line C-E-F-B? Wait, Collinear(C,F,B,E) means all those points lie on the same straight line. So points C, F, B, E are on a straight line. That might mean that F is between C and B, or maybe somewhere else along that line. But since there's a line CE, and F lies on that line (since PointF lies on Line(C,E)), so F is on line CE. Also, there's a point E connected to line CE, so E is on that line as well.

Also, there's an exterior angle at Angle(F,B,E) related to triangle ABF. So Angle(F,B,E) is an exterior angle for triangle ABF. According to the exterior angle theorem, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So if we can find those, we can get the measure of that exterior angle.

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle 2, which is defined as Angle(F,B,E). Wait, no: the problem says:

Angle(1) = Angle(A,F,B)
Angle(2) = Angle(F,B,E)
Angle(3) = ?

And then Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)? Wait, wait, looking back:

Wait, the user wrote:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)" — but that seems like a typo. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be adding MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) and MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 180? Or perhaps another relation?

Let me check again. The original text has:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)

But that notation isn't standard. Maybe it's meant to say that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) and MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 180? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 180? Because sometimes in problems, angles that form a linear pair add up to 180. But given that Angle(F,B,E) is an exterior angle of triangle ABF, and angle 2 is Angle(F,B,E), perhaps there's more relations here.

Alternatively, looking at the next part:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)),180)" – this seems like the sum of three angles equals 180. But that would imply that they are angles of a triangle. However, the triangle mentioned is Triangle(A,B,F), so the angles should be at A, B, F. Wait, the angles of triangle ABF would be Angle at A (which is Angle(B,A,F)), Angle at B (Angle(A,B,F)), and Angle at F (Angle(A,F,B))? Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In triangle ABF, the three angles are:

At vertex A: between BA and FA → which could be Angle(BAF) or similar.

At vertex B: between AB and BF → which is Angle(ABF).

At vertex F: between AF and BF → which is Angle(AFB).

But the problem mentions Angle(A,F,B), which is the angle at B between A and F. So that's the same as Angle(ABF). Similarly, Angle(A,F,B) is the angle at B between A and F, so yes, that's one of the angles of triangle ABF.

So, according to the problem statement:

There's a statement: "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)),180)". This seems confusing because Angle(A,F,B) is the same as Angle(ABF), which is the angle at B. Then, Angle(F,B,A) would be the angle at B between F and A, which is the same as Angle(ABF). Wait, but that would make two instances of the same angle. Maybe there's a typo here. Alternatively, perhaps it was meant to be the sum of the three angles of triangle ABF equals 180. Since the three angles of a triangle sum to 180, that makes sense. So perhaps the problem is saying that MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)) = 180. But that would just be redundant if they're the three angles of the triangle. However, since Angle(A,F,B) is the angle at B, Angle(F,B,A) is the same as that angle, and Angle(B,A,F) is the angle at A. Wait, maybe the problem had a typo and actually refers to different angles.

Wait, maybe the third term is MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)), which is the angle at A between B and F. So, in triangle ABF, the angles are:

At A: Angle(B,A,F) = Angle(BAF)

At B: Angle(A,B,F) = Angle(ABF)

At F: Angle(A,F,B) = Angle(AFB)?

Wait, no. If you have triangle ABF, then the three angles are:

At vertex A: between segments AB and AF → angle BAF.

At vertex B: between BA and BF → angle ABF.

At vertex F: between AF and BF → angle AFB.

Therefore, the sum of these three angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) = 180. Wait, but Angle(A,F,B) is the same as Angle(ABF) at vertex B. So that would mean the sum of angle at A, angle at B, and angle at F equals 180. But the way the problem writes it, it's adding MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)) = 180. But if Angle(A,F,B) is the angle at B, then Angle(F,B,A) would be the same as Angle(ABF), and Angle(B,A,F) is the angle at A. So that's the same as adding angle at B, angle at B, and angle at A. Which would not necessarily sum to 180 unless angle at B is zero. So that suggests there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion in notation.

Alternatively, maybe the third term is supposed to be the angle at F. For example, maybe the problem meant MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) ? No, that still doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mislabeling here. Let me think again. Given that the problem states:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)),180)"

If we assume that each of these three terms represents the three angles of triangle ABF, then:

Angle(A,F,B) = angle at B (ABF)

Angle(F,B,A) = angle at B again? No, that can't be. Unless there's a typo and the second term is supposed to be Angle(B,F,A) instead of Angle(F,B,A). Alternatively, maybe Angle(F,B,A) is the angle at A. Wait, Angle(F,B,A) would be the angle at B between F and A, which is the same as angle ABF. So again, same issue.

This seems confusing. However, the problem also states that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)), 22). So, MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)) = 22 degrees. That is, the angle at A in triangle ABF is 22 degrees. So that would be Angle(BAF) = 22 degrees.

Then, the problem says that Angle(A,F,B) equals Angle(C,F,A). Let me note that down. So Angle(A,F,B) is the angle at B in triangle ABF, which is angle ABF. And Angle(C,F,A) is the angle at F between C and A. So angle CFA. So, angle ABF equals angle CFA. 

Moreover, there's an exterior angle at Angle(F,B,E) which is an exterior angle of triangle ABF. So, Angle(F,B,E) is an exterior angle. By the exterior angle theorem, this angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of the triangle. In triangle ABF, the exterior angle at B (if extended) would be adjacent to angle ABF. But here, the exterior angle is at point B, but the line BE is extending from B through E. Wait, but earlier we know that points C, F, B, E are collinear. So, line CFE is a straight line passing through B. Therefore, point F is on line CEB. So, if we consider triangle ABF, and the exterior angle at B would be along the extension of BF beyond B. But since F is on line CEB, then the line BF is part of line CEB. Therefore, the exterior angle at B would be along line BE. Wait, but the exterior angle is Angle(F,B,E). So that angle is formed at point B between F and E. Since F is on line CEB, then BE is a continuation of line CF. So, the exterior angle at B is Angle(FBE), which is supplementary to angle ABF. Wait, but the problem states that Angle(F,B,E) is an exterior angle of triangle ABF. So, using the exterior angle theorem, the measure of Angle(F,B,E) should be equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of triangle ABF. Those angles would be angle at A (BAF) and angle at F (AFB). Wait, but angle at F is Angle(AFB). So, Angle(F,B,E) = angle BAF + angle AFB.

But we know that angle BAF is 22 degrees. So if we can find angle AFB, then we can compute Angle(F,B,E). However, angle AFB is the third angle of triangle ABF. Since the sum of angles in triangle ABF is 180 degrees, and we know angle at B (ABF) and angle at A (BAF), then angle at F (AFB) can be computed. Wait, but we don't know angle at B yet. Wait, let's recap.

We know angle BAF is 22 degrees (from Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)), 22)). We also know that angle ABF equals angle CFA (from Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,A))). So, angle ABF = angle CFA.

But angle CFA is part of some other structure. Let me look at the other given angles. The initial angles given are:

Angle(C,A,B) = 22 degrees. That is, angle at A between C and B. So, angle CAB is 22 degrees.

Angle(A,C,B) = 23 degrees. That is, angle at C between A and B. So, angle ACB is 23 degrees.

Angle(A,D,B) = 32 degrees. That is, angle at D between A and B. Wait, no—wait, angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D between A and B. Wait, but D is connected via lines A-D and B-D. So, point D is connected to both A and B. So, angle at D between A and B. Hmm. 

Additionally, there's a triangle ADF. So, points A, D, F. Also, triangle ABF. 

But perhaps we can use the fact that angle CAB is 22 degrees, angle ACB is 23 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, angles at A, C, and B. Wait, but do we know if ABC is a triangle? Well, points A, B, C are connected via lines AB and AC? Wait, point C is connected to A and B? Wait, the lines given include Line(C,E), Line(A,B), Line(A,F), Line(A,D), Line(B,D), Line(C,D). So, point C is connected to E and D. Also, point A is connected to B, F, D. Point B is connected to D. So, triangle ABC may not be directly formed. Wait, but there's an angle at A between C and B (angle CAB) being 22 degrees, and angle at C between A and B (ACB) being 23 degrees. So, perhaps triangle ABC exists. If that's the case, then in triangle ABC, angles at A, B, and C. Wait, but angle at B is unknown. Wait, but angle at A is 22 degrees, angle at C is 23 degrees, so angle at B would be 180 - 22 - 23 = 135 degrees. But I'm not sure if triangle ABC is valid. Because point C is connected to D and E, but not necessarily to B. Wait, the line CB is not explicitly mentioned. Wait, line CB would be part of line AB? Not sure. Let me think again.

But maybe triangle ABC is not a direct triangle. However, given that angle CAB and angle ACB are given, perhaps there's a relationship. Let me proceed with that thought. Suppose that triangle ABC has angles at A=22°, at C=23°, so angle at B would be 180 - 22 -23 = 135°. But I need to confirm whether triangle ABC exists. If points A, B, and C are connected such that AB and AC exist, then yes. Since line AB exists (line A,B), and point C is connected to A (through line A,C?), but wait, the lines given are Line(C,E), Line(A,B), Line(A,F), Line(A,D), Line(B,D), Line(C,D). So, point C is connected to E and D, but not directly to B. So, unless line CB is implied through other connections. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe focus on triangle ABD. Since there's a line AD and BD. So, triangle ABD has points A, B, D. The angle at D between A and B is given as 32 degrees (angle ADB). So, angle at D is 32 degrees. Also, angle at A between D and B is... Wait, angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D between A and B. So, that's angle ADB = 32 degrees. So, in triangle ABD, angle at D is 32 degrees. What about the other angles? 

But without knowing sides or other angles, maybe not helpful yet. Let's go back to triangle ABF. We know angle at A (BAF) is 22 degrees, and angle ABF equals angle CFA. Also, angle(F,B,E) is an exterior angle of triangle ABF. 

So, going back to that, if we can find angle ABF, then angle CFA is equal to that. Then, in triangle CFA, if we can find other angles, perhaps we can find angle CFA.

But first, let's try to find angle ABF. Since in triangle ABF, the sum of angles is 180. So, angle at A (22°) + angle at B (ABF) + angle at F (AFB) = 180. So, angle ABF + angle AFB = 158°. Also, angle ABF = angle CFA. So, angle CFA = angle ABF. Now, if we can find angle CFA, then we can relate it to angle ABF.

Looking at angle CFA. Point C is connected to F and A. So, triangle CFA has vertices C, F, A. The angle at F is angle CFA. To find angle CFA, perhaps we can use other triangles involving point C.

Earlier, we had angle CAB = 22°, angle ACB = 23°, which were given. So, if we can find angle at C, perhaps in triangle ABC. But as before, unless triangle ABC is valid. Wait, even if triangle ABC is not directly formed, those angles are given. So, assuming that points A, B, C are connected in such a way that angle CAB is 22°, angle ACB is 23°, then the third angle at B in triangle ABC would be 180 - 22 -23 = 135°. But again, this requires that triangle ABC exists. 

Assuming that, then angle ABC = 135°. But angle ABC is at point B between A and C. Now, considering that points C, F, B, E are colinear (collinear(C,F,B,E)), meaning that line CFE passes through B. So, the line from C through F to B and E. So, point F is on line CB extended? Wait, if points C, F, B, E are collinear, then F is between C and B? Or maybe F is beyond B? It depends on the order. 

But since there's a line CE, and point F is on line CE. So, points C, F, E are on line CE. Also, point B is on line CE. So, the entire set {C, F, B, E} are on the same line. So, the order could be C---F---B---E or C---B---F---E, etc., depending on positions. But since there's a line from C to E, and F is on that line. Also, there's a line from A to F, so point F is connected to A. 

Assuming that, then line CE includes points C, F, B, E. So, if I imagine line CE, with points arranged as C, then F, then B, then E. Or maybe C, B, F, E. Depending on where F is located. But since there's a line from A to F, and angle at A involving F and B. 

But regardless, the key thing is that angle at point B between C and F is part of the line CE. So, angle between BC and BF. Wait, but since B is on line CE, the direction from B to F is along line CE. 

Given that, let's consider triangle CFA. Point C, F, A. Angle at F is angle CFA. If we can find that angle, we can find angle ABF. 

To find angle CFA, we might need to consider triangle CFA or other triangles. Let's think about triangle ACD. Wait, there's a line CD. Points A, D are connected. Point D is connected to B. Also, angle at D between A and B is 32 degrees. 

Alternatively, let's consider triangle ACF. If we can find some angles or sides. 

Alternatively, think about the angles around point A. At point A, we have several lines: AB, AF, AD. The angles at A are:

- Between CA and AB: angle CAB = 22°
- Between DA and AB: angle DAB?
- Between FA and AB: angle FAB = 22° (since angle(B,A,F) is 22°)
Wait, angle(B,A,F) is the angle at A between B and F, which is angle BAF = 22°, as per the given Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,F)), 22). 

So, at point A, we have multiple lines: AB, AF, AD, and possibly others. The total angles around point A should add up to 360°, but since we are dealing with specific lines, maybe focusing on the ones that matter. 

For instance, angle CAB is 22°, which is between CA and AB. Angle BAF is 22°, between BA and FA. So, if we can find the angle between CA and FA, which would be angle CAF. Since angle CAB is 22°, and angle BAF is 22°, then angle CAF = angle CAB + angle BAF = 22 + 22 = 44°, assuming that FA is on the opposite side of AB relative to CA. Wait, but this depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, if points C and F are on the same side of AB, then angle CAF would be |angle CAB - angle BAF| or sum. But without a diagram, it's tricky. However, since angle CFA is involved, which is part of triangle CFA. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle CFA, we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines if we know sides, but since we don't have lengths, maybe not. However, maybe there's another approach. 

Let me try to summarize known angles:

From triangle ABC (assuming it exists):

- Angle at A: 22° (CAB)
- Angle at C: 23° (ACB)
- Angle at B: 135° (as calculated earlier)

But this assumes triangle ABC is valid. Now, if angle at B is 135°, and since point B is on line CE which contains F, then angle between CB and BF would be part of that 135°. 

Wait, since line CE passes through B, and F is on that line. So, the line BF is part of line CE. Thus, angle between CB and BF is the same as the angle between CB and CE, which is a straight line. Wait, but point B is on line CE, so CB is part of line CE. Therefore, the angle between CB and BF is zero, since they are colinear. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If B is on line CE, then CB is a segment from C to B, and BF is a segment from B to F. Since F is on line CE, then BF is along CE. So, angle between CB and BF is a straight line. Therefore, angle between CB and BF is 180°, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the angles around point B. At point B, we have various lines: BA, BD, BF, BE (since B is on line CE, which includes F and E). So, angle between BA and BF is angle ABF, which we previously denoted as x. Also, angle between BA and BE would be something, and angle between BF and BE would be angle FBE, which is the exterior angle mentioned earlier. 

But since points C, F, B, E are collinear, the line from B goes through F and E. So, if we consider the line BF, which extends from B through F to E. So, the direction from B to F is towards E. 

Now, returning to triangle ABF. We know angle at A (BAF) is 22°, and we want to find angle ABF (x) and angle AFB (y). From earlier, x + y = 158°, and angle AFB = x (since angle ABF = angle CFA). 

So, if we can find angle AFB, then we can find x. How?

Well, angle AFB is part of triangle AFB, but also, angle CFA is equal to x. So, in triangle CFA, angle at F is x, and we might need to find other angles or sides. 

But how? Let's think about triangle CFA. We know angle at C is angle ACF. Wait, angle at C between A and F. Is there any information about that?

Earlier, we had angle ACB = 23°, which is the angle at C between A and B. Since point F is on line CE, which passes through B, then the line CF passes through B. So, angle between CA and CF is the same as angle ACB, which is 23°, because CF is aligned with CB. Wait, because F is on line CE, which includes B. So, line CF is the same as line CB extended to F. Therefore, angle between CA and CF is the same as angle between CA and CB, which is 23°. 

Thus, in triangle CFA, we have:

- At point C: angle ACF = 23°
- At point F: angle CFA = x (same as angle ABF)
- At point A: angle CAF = ?

Sum of angles in triangle CFA is 180°, so:

angle CAF + angle ACF + angle CFA = 180°
=> angle CAF + 23° + x = 180°
=> angle CAF = 157° - x

Now, what is angle CAF? Earlier, we considered that angle CAB is 22°, and angle BAF is 22°, so maybe angle CAF is the sum or difference of those. 

Assuming that points C, A, F are arranged such that angle CAF is composed of angle CAB and angle BAF. If line AF is on the same side of AB as point C, then angle CAF = angle CAB + angle BAF = 22° + 22° = 44°. Otherwise, if they are on opposite sides, it would be the difference. 

Assuming that AF is on the same side as CA, making angle CAF = 44°, then:

angle CAF = 44° = 157° - x => x = 157° - 44° = 113°

But then angle ABF = x = 113°, and in triangle ABF, angle at B is 113°, angle at A is 22°, so angle at F would be 180 - 113 - 22 = 45°. Then, the exterior angle at B (angle FBE) would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which would be angle at A (22°) + angle at F (45°) = 67°. But then angle 2 is this exterior angle, which would be 67°, which is not among the answer choices. But the options are A.32, B.33, C.45, D.55. So 67 is not listed. Hence, this assumption might be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle CAF is not 44°. Perhaps the arrangement is different. Let's reconsider angle CAF. 

If line AF is such that when you go from CA to AF, you turn through some angle. Since angle CAB is 22°, which is from CA to AB. Angle BAF is 22°, from BA to AF. So, if AF is on the opposite side of AB compared to CA, then angle CAF would be 22° + 22° = 44°, as before. But if AF is on the same side, then it could be 22° - 22° = 0°, which is impossible. So likely 44°. 

But that leads us to an inconsistency. So maybe our assumption that triangle ABC exists is incorrect. Let me re-examine that. 

If angle CAB is 22°, angle ACB is 23°, and angle ABC is 135°, then in triangle ABC, those angles sum to 22+23+135=180, which works. So that part is okay. 

However, in triangle CFA, if angle CAF is 44°, then x = 113°, leading to angle at F being 45°, giving exterior angle of 67°, which isn't an option. 

But since the answer choices don't include 67°, perhaps my assumption about angle CAF is wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe angle CAF is not 44°, but something else. 

Wait, suppose that point F is not on the same side as C relative to AB. For example, if point F is on the opposite side of AB compared to C. Then, angle CAF would be angle CAB - angle BAF = 22° - 22° = 0°, which is impossible. So that can't be. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle CAF is measured differently. Let me visualize this. Imagine point A with lines AB, AF, and AD. Line AB goes to B, line AF goes to F, and line AD goes to D. 

Since angle CAB is 22°, that means from CA to AB is 22°. Angle BAF is 22°, which means from BA to AF is 22°. So, if we imagine standing at point A, facing towards B, turning left by 22° to face towards F. Then, the direction from A to C is such that from CA to AB is 22°. So, if you are at point A, facing towards C, then turning towards B by 22° gets you to AB. 

If AF is obtained by turning from BA by 22°, then depending on which direction (left or right), the position of F relative to CA changes. Assuming that the diagram is drawn such that all these angles are on the same plane, but without a diagram, it's ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe angle CAF is not simply the sum of CAB and BAF. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points to calculate.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Let's define AB along the positive x-axis. Let’s say AB is horizontal. So, point B is at (b, 0) for some b > 0.

Angle CAB is 22°, so line AC makes a 22° angle above AB. Let me assume that point C is somewhere in the plane. Let's assign coordinates to C. Let's say AC has length 1 for simplicity. So, coordinates of C would be (cos(22°), sin(22°)) ≈ (0.927, 0.375). But exact values may not matter.

Now, angle ACB is 23°, which is the angle at point C between points A and B. Using the law of sines in triangle ABC:

sin(angle at A)/CB = sin(angle at C)/AB = sin(angle at B)/AC

But this might get complex without knowing side lengths. Alternatively, since we already assumed angle at A is 22°, angle at C is 23°, angle at B is 135°, then if we take AB as length c, BC as a, and AC as b, then by the law of sines:

a / sin(22°) = b / sin(135°) = c / sin(23°)

But without actual lengths, it's hard to use. However, the main point is that angle at B is 135°, which is the angle between BA and BC. 

Now, point F is on line CE, which includes points C, F, B, E. Since B is on line CE, and F is also on that line. So, line CE passes through B. Let's assume that line CE is the same as line CB extended past B to F and E. So, point F is along the line extending from C through B to F. 

So, if we consider line CB, extending beyond B to F. So, point F is on line CB extended beyond B. 

Therefore, vector from C to B is along the line CB, and F is further along that line. 

Now, angle BAF is 22°, which is the angle between BA and AF. Since BA is from A to B, and AF is from A to F. So, if we can determine the direction of AF, we can find its relationship with BA and CA.

Since point F is on line CB extended, let's parametrize line CB. Let's assume coordinates again. 

Let me continue with the coordinate system. Let’s fix point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0) for simplicity. Then, angle CAB is 22°, so line AC makes a 22° angle with AB. Let’s find coordinates of C. Assume AC has length 1 for simplicity. So, coordinates of C are (cos(22°), sin(22°)) ≈ (0.927, 0.375). 

Now, line CB goes from C to B. The coordinates of C are approximately (0.927, 0.375), and B is at (1, 0). The slope of CB is (0 - 0.375)/(1 - 0.927) ≈ (-0.375)/0.073 ≈ -5.137. So, line CB has a steep negative slope. Extending this line beyond B to point F. Let's parameterize this line. 

Parametric equations for line CB: starting at C, moving towards B, then beyond. Let's write parametrically as:

x = x_C + t*(x_B - x_C)
y = y_C + t*(y_B - y_C)

Where t=0 gives C, t=1 gives B, and t>1 gives points beyond B. 

So, for t=1, we reach B at (1, 0). For t=1 + k, we get F at some point further along the line. 

Now, we need to find coordinates of F such that angle BAF is 22°. 

Point F lies on line CB extended beyond B. Let's denote F as (x_F, y_F). 

Vector AF goes from A(0,0) to F(x_F, y_F). Vector AB goes from A(0,0) to B(1,0). 

The angle between vectors AF and AB is 22°. 

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AF · AB) / (|AF| * |AB|)

Where theta is the angle between AF and AB, which is 22°. 

Compute AF · AB = x_F * 1 + y_F * 0 = x_F.

|AF| = sqrt(x_F² + y_F²)

|AB| = 1

So,

cos(22°) = x_F / sqrt(x_F² + y_F²)

Square both sides:

cos²(22°) = x_F² / (x_F² + y_F²)

Rearranged:

x_F² = cos²(22°)(x_F² + y_F²)

=> x_F² = cos²(22°) x_F² + cos²(22°) y_F²

=> x_F² (1 - cos²(22°)) = cos²(22°) y_F²

=> x_F² sin²(22°) = cos²(22°) y_F²

=> tan²(22°) = y_F² / x_F²

=> y_F / x_F = ±tan(22°)

So, the slope of AF is tan(22°) or -tan(22°). But since point F is on line CB extended beyond B, which has a negative slope (as calculated earlier), we need to determine the sign of y_F/x_F. 

From earlier calculation, line CB has a negative slope, so moving from C to B, the line goes downward. Extending beyond B, continuing in the same direction. So, the direction from B onwards along CB is downwards. So, for point F beyond B on line CB, the y-coordinate decreases further. So, if we consider the slope of AF, it depends on where F is. 

But we have that the slope of AF is either tan(22°) or -tan(22°). Let's consider possible scenarios. 

If angle BAF is measured such that AF is above the x-axis (positive y-direction), then the slope would be positive, implying y_F / x_F = tan(22°). But since F is on line CB, which has negative slope, this would require that the line AF has a positive slope, intersecting line CB at B. Let's check if this is possible.

Alternatively, if the angle is below the x-axis, then slope would be negative. Let's explore both possibilities.

Case 1: Slope of AF is positive (y_F / x_F = tan(22°)). This implies that point F is in the upper half-plane. But since F is on line CB, which extends downward from B, this would only happen if F is between C and B. But in our earlier setup, F is on line CE which includes B, so it could be anywhere along the line. However, since we are told that F is on line CE, which includes B, and there's a point E on the same line. 

But if F is between C and B, then line AF would connect A to F between C and B. However, in this scenario, the angle BAF would be determined by the position of F. 

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe instead of coordinates, let's use vectors or other relationships.

Alternatively, since we have angle CFA = x (same as angle ABF), and we have in triangle CFA:

angle CAF + angle ACF + angle CFA = 180

We have angle ACF = 23°, angle CFA = x, and angle CAF = ?

If we can express angle CAF in terms of known quantities. 

Earlier, we tried to assume angle CAF = 44°, but that led to inconsistencies. Let me think again about angle CAF. 

Angle CAF is the angle at A between CA and AF. We know angle CAB is 22°, which is the angle between CA and AB. Angle BAF is 22°, which is the angle between BA and AF. So, if we consider the angle between CA and AF, it would depend on the direction of AF relative to CA and AB. 

Imagine that at point A, we have two directions: CA and AB, forming a 22° angle. Then, AF forms a 22° angle with AB. Depending on which side AF is, the angle between CA and AF can be calculated. 

If AF is on the same side of AB as CA, then the angle between CA and AF would be 22° (CA to AB) minus 22° (AB to AF) = 0°, which is not possible. 

If AF is on the opposite side of AB relative to CA, then the angle between CA and AF would be 22° + 22° = 44°. This seems plausible. 

So, angle CAF = 44°. Then, in triangle CFA:

44 + 23 + x = 180 → x = 113°. 

So, angle CFA = 113°, which is equal to angle ABF. 

Now, in triangle ABF, angles are:

at A: 22°, at B: 113°, at F: 180 - 22 - 113 = 45°. 

So, angle AFB = 45°. 

Now, the exterior angle at B, which is angle FBE (angle 2), is equal to the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles of triangle ABF. These are angle at A (22°) and angle at F (45°). So, angle FBE = 22 + 45 = 67°. 

But none of the answer choices are 67°. The options are A.32, B.33, C.45, D.55. Hmm. So this suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in identifying which angles are the non-adjacent ones. The exterior angle at B (angle FBE) would be equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In triangle ABF, the exterior angle at B would be equal to the sum of angles at A and F. Yes, that's correct. So, angle FBE = angle BAF + angle AFB = 22 + 45 = 67°. 

But since this isn't an option, I must have made an error somewhere. Let's revisit assumptions. 

Perhaps angle CAF is not 44°, but something else. Let me re-examine. 

If angle CAF is not 44°, but instead, we have to account for the fact that point F is on line CE, which passes through B. Let's consider that line AF intersects line CE at point F. 

Maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle ABF and triangle CFA. 

In triangle ABF, we have angle at A: 22°, angle at B: x, angle at F: 180 - 22 - x = 158 - x. 

In triangle CFA, we have angle at C: 23°, angle at F: x, angle at A: let's call it z. So, z + 23 + x = 180 → z = 157 - x. 

But z is angle CAF, which we previously thought was 44°, but if that's not the case, perhaps there's a relationship between z and other angles. 

If we can relate z to other parts of the diagram. 

At point A, the sum of angles around point A would be 360°, but since we're dealing with planar geometry, the angles around A would be the sum of angles between the various lines. 

At point A, we have lines AB, AF, AD, and possibly others. The angles at A include:

- Angle between CA and AB: 22°
- Angle between BA and AF: 22°
- Angle between DA and AB: let's call it w (angle DAB)
- Angle between DA and AF: ?
- Angle between CA and AF: z (which is angle CAF)

But without knowing more about the diagram, it's challenging. However, if we assume that line AD is such that angle DAB is part of triangle ABD, which has angle at D of 32°, as given. 

In triangle ABD, angle at D is 32°, and we might relate it to other angles. 

But this seems too vague. Let me think of another approach. 

Since angle at D between A and B is 32°, which is angle ADB = 32°. So, in triangle ABD, we have angle at D = 32°, angle at A = ?, angle at B = ?. 

If we can relate this to other parts. 

But without additional information about sides or other angles, it's difficult. 

Wait, but earlier we derived that angle FBE = 67°, which is not an option. Since the options are 32, 33, 45, 55, and 67 is close to 67, but none match. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

If angle CAF = 44°, then in triangle CFA:

z = 44°, angle at C = 23°, angle at F = x. So, x = 180 - 44 - 23 = 113°. 

In triangle ABF, angle at B is x = 113°, angle at A is 22°, so angle at F is 180 - 113 - 22 = 45°. 

Exterior angle at B: 22 + 45 = 67°. 

But 67 is not an option. Maybe the question has a typo, or I missed something. 

Wait, looking back at the problem, there's also a mention of Angle(A,D,B) = 32°, which is angle at D between A and B, which is angle ADB = 32°. 

Maybe this angle relates to triangle ABD, and there's a connection to other parts. 

In triangle ABD, we have angle at D = 32°. If we can find other angles, maybe we can find some relation. 

But without knowing sides or other angles, it's hard. 

Wait, but what if angle at A in triangle ABD is related to angle BAF or something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral or other property. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure of angle 2 is 32°, which is the given angle ADB. But why? 

Wait, let's recall that angle 2 is the exterior angle at B, which is angle FBE. If this is equal to 67°, but none of the options match, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of angle CAF. 

If angle CAB is 22°, and angle BAF is 22°, and assuming that AF is on the opposite side of AB relative to CA, then angle CAF is 22 + 22 = 44°. 

But if AF is on the same side, then it would be 22 - 22 = 0°, which is invalid. So, 44° is the only possibility. 

So, angle CAF = 44°, leading to x = 113°, angle AFB = 45°, and exterior angle = 67°. 

Since this isn't an option, maybe the error is in assuming that angle CAF = 44°. Let's try to find another way to calculate angle CAF. 

Let me consider the full diagram. Since points C, F, B, E are collinear, and F is on line CB extended. Let's consider triangle ACF. 

We know angle at C is 23°, angle at F is x, and angle at A is z. 

But also, from point A, we have line AF and line AC, forming angle z = angle CAF. 

If we can relate z to other parts. 

At point A, the sum of angles around point A should be 360°, but since we're dealing with planar geometry, the angles formed by the lines meeting at A. 

Assume that at point A, there are lines AB, AF, and AD. The angles between these lines are:

Between CA and AB: 22° (given)

Between AB and AF: 22° (given)

Between AF and AD: let's call it m

Between AD and CA: let's call it n

But without knowing m or n, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if we assume that line AD is such that it creates certain relationships. 

Alternatively, since angle ADB is 32°, which is part of triangle ABD, maybe there's a way to relate it to other angles. 

Let me consider triangle ABD. Angle at D is 32°, angle at A is let's say p, angle at B is q. So, p + q + 32 = 180 → p + q = 148°. 

But how does this help? 

Unless there's a relationship between p and other angles. 

For example, if line AD is such that it creates some parallel lines or something. 

Alternatively, since point D is connected to B and A, and line CD is present. 

But this is getting too vague. 

Perhaps I need to revisit the assumption that triangle ABC exists. If angle CAB is 22° and angle ACB is 23°, but if points A, B, C are not in a straight line, then triangle ABC is valid. 

But if the problem is structured such that angle FBE (angle 2) is 32°, which is option A, but why? 

Wait, let me think about the exterior angle. If angle FBE is equal to the sum of angle BAF (22°) and angle AFB. If angle AFB is 32°, then angle FBE would be 22 + 32 = 54°, which is not an option. Or if angle AFB is 33°, then 22 + 33 = 55°, which is option D. 

Wait, let's assume that angle AFB is 33°, making angle FBE = 22 + 33 = 55°, which is option D. But how to justify angle AFB = 33°? 

Alternatively, let's think about the sum of angles in triangle ABF. If angle at A is 22°, and angle at B is x, and angle at F is y, then x + y = 158°. Also, angle CFA = x. In triangle CFA, angle at C is 23°, angle at F is x, angle at A is z. So, z = 157 - x. 

But if z is angle CAF, which is part of the angles at point A. If we can relate z to other angles at point A. 

Suppose that at point A, the sum of angles around A is 360°. The angles at A are:

- Between CA and AB: 22°
- Between AB and AF: 22°
- Between AF and AD: let's say m
- Between AD and CA: let's say n

But without knowing m or n, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if we assume that line AD is such that it creates a straight line with some other elements. 

Alternatively, since there's a line AD and line BD, and angle at D is 32°, perhaps there's a way to use that. 

In triangle ABD, angle at D is 32°, and if we can find other angles. 

If we can find angle at A in triangle ABD, which is angle BAD. Let's call it p. Then, angle at B in triangle ABD is angle ABD, which we can call q. So, p + q + 32 = 180 → p + q = 148°. 

But how to relate p and q to other parts. 

If line AD is connected to point D, and line CD is present, which connects to point C. 

But this is too vague. 

Maybe I need to consider that angle at A in triangle ABD is the same as angle BAF or something. 

Wait, if line AF is connected to point F, and line AD is connected to D, maybe there's a relationship. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a transversal or parallel lines. 

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think differently. 

The problem states that angle(A,F,B) equals angle(C,F,A). So, angle ABF = angle CFA. 

In triangle ABF, angle ABF = x. In triangle CFA, angle CFA = x. 

Also, in triangle CFA, angle at C is 23°, angle at F is x, angle at A is z. So, z = 157 - x. 

At point A, the angle between CA and AF is z, which is 157 - x. 

But also, at point A, the angle between CA and AB is 22°, and between AB and AF is 22°. So, depending on the direction of AF, z could be 22 + 22 = 44° or 22 - 22 = 0°, or something else. 

If z = 157 - x, and z is either 44° or 0°, let's substitute:

Case 1: z = 44°

157 - x = 44 → x = 157 - 44 = 113°. As before, leading to angle FBE = 67°.

Case 2: z = 0°

157 - x = 0 → x = 157°. This would make angle CFA = 157°, which is impossible in a triangle, as the sum of angles would exceed 180°. So, invalid.

Thus, only possible value is x = 113°, leading to angle FBE = 67°. 

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the error is in the assumption that angle CAF = 44°. Let me consider that angle CAF is not 44°, but instead, it's related to angle ADB = 32°. 

Wait, angle ADB is 32°, which is part of triangle ABD. If there's a relationship between angle ADB and angle CAF, maybe through some similarity or congruence. 

Alternatively, if lines AD and CF are parallel, creating corresponding angles. But there's no information about that. 

Alternatively, since points C, F, B, E are collinear, and D is connected to B and A, maybe there's a way to use the given angle ADB = 32°. 

In triangle ABD, angle at D is 32°, and if we can relate this to angle at A or B. 

If we assume that line AD is such that it creates some relationship with other lines. 

But without more information, it's hard to proceed. 

Given that I keep arriving at 67°, which is not an option, but the closest option is D.55, perhaps there's a calculation error. Let me recheck. 

Wait, maybe I mixed up the exterior angle theorem. The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In this case, the exterior angle at B (angle FBE) is equal to the sum of the angles at A and F in triangle ABF. 

But if angle at A is 22°, and angle at F is 45°, then 22 + 45 = 67°. 

But if there's a miscalculation in angle at F. 

Let me recheck: in triangle ABF, angles are 22° at A, x at B, and y at F. x + y = 158°. Also, x = angle CFA. In triangle CFA, angles are 23° at C, x at F, and z at A. z = 157 - x. 

But if z is angle CAF, and at point A, the angle between CA and AF is z. Also, at point A, the angle between CA and AB is 22°, and between AB and AF is 22°. So, if these two angles are adjacent, then z = 22 + 22 = 44°, as before. 

Thus, z = 44° = 157 - x → x = 113°. 

Then, in triangle ABF, y = 158 - x = 158 - 113 = 45°. 

So, angle at F is 45°, and exterior angle is 22 + 45 = 67°. 

But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D.55, and there's a rounding error or a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at F is not 45°, but 33°, leading to angle FBE = 22 + 33 = 55°, which is option D. 

How could angle at F be 33°? Let me see. 

If x = angle ABF = 157 - z, where z is angle CAF. If z is different. 

Wait, if angle CAF is not 44°, but let's say it's 157 - x, and also, at point A, the angle between CA and AF is z = 157 - x. 

But at point A, the angle between CA and AB is 22°, and between AB and AF is 22°, so z = 22 + 22 = 44°, as before. 

So, z = 44° = 157 - x → x = 113°. 

No change. 

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that angle CAF is 44°. Maybe it's not. Let me think: if AF is such that it creates a certain relationship with AD. 

Since angle ADB is 32°, and D is connected to A and B. If there's a way to relate angle ADB to angle CAF. 

For example, if lines AD and CF are parallel, then angle ADB would be equal to angle CFD, but this is speculation. 

Alternatively, if there's a parallelogram or something. 

Without more info, it's hard to say. 

Given that, and since 67 is closest to 67, and the options are 32, 33, 45, 55, perhaps the intended answer is D.55, assuming a calculation error of 67 - 12 = 55. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the exterior angle. Let me recheck: 

Exterior angle at B is equal to sum of non-adjacent interior angles, which are at A and F. So, 22 + 45 = 67. 

But if the problem states that Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180), which might mean that MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. But Angle(2) is Angle(F,B,E), so this would imply 2*MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = 90°, which is not matching. 

Wait, the original problem says:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)" — this might be a typo, and it should be Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180) means MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. But if Angle(2) is Angle(F,B,E), then this would mean 2 * MeasureOf(...) = 180, so Measure is 90°. But this contradicts previous results. 

Alternatively, the problem might mean that MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. But if Angle(2) is Angle(F,B,E), then this would be 2*Angle(F,B,E) = 180 → Angle(F,B,E) = 90°. 

But this doesn't align with our previous calculation of 67°. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(2) is another angle. Let me recheck the problem statement:

"Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Equals(Angle(1), Angle(A,F,B))
Equals(Angle(2), Angle(F,B,E))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 22)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(3)))
Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)
..."

Wait, the last line says Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180). But Angle(2) is Angle(F,B,E), so this would be adding MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180, which would imply 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = 90°. But this contradicts our previous calculation. 

But this suggests that MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = 90°, which would make angle 2 = 90°, but this is not an option. 

This indicates a possible error in the problem statement or in my understanding. 

But given the confusion, and since the options are limited, and the closest to 67° is 55° (option D), perhaps the intended answer is D.55, assuming a calculation error in the problem or a miscalculation on my part. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the exterior angle is 32°, which is option A. Why? 

If angle FBE = 32°, then it would be equal to the sum of angle BAF (22°) and angle AFB. So, 22 + angle AFB = 32 → angle AFB = 10°. But this would make angle at F in triangle ABF = 10°, and angle at B = 180 - 22 - 10 = 148°. Then, in triangle CFA, angle at F = 148°, which would make angle CAF = 180 - 23 - 148 = 9°, which would mean at point A, angle CAF = 9°, but this conflicts with the earlier assumption of 44°. 

This is not consistent. 

Alternatively, if angle FBE = 33°, then angle AFB = 33 - 22 = 11°, leading to angle at B = 180 - 22 - 11 = 147°, and in triangle CFA, angle at F = 147°, angle at C = 23°, so angle CAF = 180 - 23 - 147 = 10°. Again, inconsistent with previous calculations. 

Alternatively, if angle FBE = 32°, and this is equal to angle ADB = 32°, which is given. This would suggest that angle FBE = 32°, which is option A. But why would they be equal? 

If angle FBE is equal to angle ADB, which is 32°, then angle 2 = 32°, option A. 

But why would they be equal? This would require some geometric reason, like alternate interior angles or something. 

If lines BE and AD are parallel, then angle FBE (alternate to angle ADB). But there's no information about parallel lines. 

But given that this is the only way to match the options, and since angle ADB is 32°, it's possible that the problem expects this to be the answer. 

Thus, despite the earlier calculations suggesting 67°, the closest option is A.32, but I'm not sure. 

However, given the time spent and the lack of better alternatives, I'll go with option D.55, assuming that there was a calculation error and the correct answer is 55°, which is option D. 

But I'm uncertain. Another possibility is that the exterior angle is 32°, making it option A. 

Wait, let me try once more. If angle FBE = 32°, and this is the exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the non-adjacent angles, which are angle BAF (22°) and angle AFB. So, 22 + angle AFB = 32 → angle AFB = 10°. 

In triangle ABF, angle at F is 10°, angle at A is 22°, so angle at B is 180 - 22 - 10 = 148°. 

In triangle CFA, angle at F is 148°, angle at C is 23°, so angle at A is 180 - 148 - 23 = 9°. 

So, angle CAF = 9°. 

At point A, the angle between CA and AF is 9°, while the angle between CA and AB is 22°, and between AB and AF is 22°. This would mean that the total angle at A is 22 + 22 = 44°, but we have angle CAF = 9°, which is conflicting. 

This suggests inconsistency. 

Given all this, I think the most plausible answer, despite the inconsistency, is option D.55, assuming a calculation error. Alternatively, if the problem intends for the exterior angle to be 32°, then option A. 

But since I'm stuck, and given that in the beginning, angle ADB is 32°, and if there's a missing link, I'll go with option A.32. 

But this is very uncertain. 

Wait, let me think about the given angle ADB = 32°. If angle FBE is equal to angle ADB, then it would be 32°, which is option A. 

But why would they be equal? If lines BE and AD are parallel, then angle FBE would be equal to angle ADB. 

If BE is parallel to AD, then yes. But is there a reason for that? 

Given that D is connected to B and A, and E is on line CE, which includes F and B. If BE is parallel to AD, then yes. 

But there's no explicit information about parallel lines. However, given the lack of other options, this might be the intended path. 

Thus, angle FBE = angle ADB = 32°, making the answer A.32. 

But this is speculative. 

Given the ambiguity, and the presence of 32° as an option, I will choose A.32.

- Lines: `Line(C,E)`, `Line(A,B)`, `Line(A,F)`, `Line(A,D)`, `Line(B,D)`, `Line(C,D)`
- Angles with specified measures:
  - `Angle(C,A,B) = 22°`
  - `Angle(A,C,B) = 23°`
  - `Angle(A,D,B) = 32°`
- Additional relationships:
  - `Angle(C,F,A) = Angle(A,F,B)` (i.e., `∠CFA = ∠ABF`)
  - `Angle(F,B,E)` is an **exterior angle** of triangle `△ABF`
  - `PointLiesOnLine(C,F,B,E)` ⇒ Points `C, F, B, E` are collinear
  - `MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(3))`
  - `Add(MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 180)` ⇒ Likely means:  
    `∠(F,B,E) + ∠(2) = 180°`

---

### **2. Identifying Key Triangles and Angles**

- **Triangle ABF**: Contains angles:
  - `∠(A,F,B)`: at point B
  - `∠(B,A,F)`: at point A = 22° (given)
  - `∠(A,F,B) = ∠(C,F,A)` (given)
  - So: `∠(ABF) = ∠(CFA)`

- **Triangle CFA**: Has angles:
  - `∠(C,A,F)`: at point A
  - `∠(C,F,A)`: at point F = `∠(ABF)` (from above)
  - `∠(A,C,B) = 23°` (given) ⇒ This is the angle at point C
