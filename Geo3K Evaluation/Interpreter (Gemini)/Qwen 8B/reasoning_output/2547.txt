MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints and see if I can visualize the diagram or find relationships between the points and lines.

So, we have triangle QRS. That means points Q, R, S form a triangle. Then there's a circle W. The problem mentions several lines connecting these points: QR, RS, QS (so those are the sides of the triangle). Also, there are points U, V, T connected via lines: QU, QT, RU, RV, ST, SV. Additionally, there are tangents from the lines QR, QS, and RS to the circle W. Points U, V, T lie on specific lines and also on the circle W. 

Let me note down the key points:

- Triangle QRS with points Q, R, S.
- Circle W tangent to lines QR, QS, RS. So, the circle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle? Wait, but if a circle is tangent to all three sides of a triangle, it would be the incircle. But then, the points of tangency would be specific points on each side. However, here, the points U, V, T are mentioned as lying on certain lines and also on the circle. Let me check the details again.

Wait, the constraints mention that:

- Point U lies on line QR and is on the circle W.
- Similarly, point V lies on line RS and is on the circle W.
- Point T lies on line QS and is on the circle W.

But since the circle is tangent to lines QR, QS, and RS, the points of tangency should be unique points on each side. Therefore, perhaps U, V, T are exactly those points of tangency?

Moreover, the lengths given are:

- Length of QU is 14.
- Length of RV is 27.
- Length of ST is 17.
- Also, Length of QT equals twice x, which is equal to Length of QU, so QT = 14, hence 2x = 14 => x=7? Wait, but wait, let me check again.

Wait, the problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), Mul(2,x)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,U)), LengthOf(Line(Q,T))). Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,U)), 14). So, substituting, since LengthOf(QU) is 14, then LengthOf(QT) is also 14, and that equals 2x. So 2x = 14 → x = 7. But then why is this question even here? Maybe I'm missing something because maybe there are more constraints that affect this value?

Wait, but perhaps there are more relations. For example, the other equalities:

- Length(RU) equals Length(RV) which is 27. So RU = 27.
- Length(SV) equals Length(ST) which is 17. So SV = 17.

Additionally, the problem mentions that the circle is tangent to lines QR, QS, RS. If U, V, T are the points of tangency, then perhaps we can use properties related to tangent segments from a point to a circle.

In triangle geometry, for the incircle, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter. Let me recall that formula. For a triangle ABC with inradius r and semiperimeter s, the lengths from each vertex to the point of tangency on the opposite side are s - opposite side length.

Wait, more precisely, if the incircle touches BC at D, AC at E, AB at F, then AF = AE = s - BC, BF = BD = s - AC, CD = CE = s - AB.

But in our case, the circle W is tangent to QR, QS, RS. So if U is the point of tangency on QR, V on RS, T on QS. Then, the lengths from the vertices to these points would follow similar logic.

Let me denote the triangle QRS. Let me think about the standard notation. Let’s suppose:

- The incircle touches QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T.

Then, according to the incircle properties:

The length from Q to U (on QR) would be equal to the length from Q to T (on QS). Because both are equal to (perimeter/2) minus the opposite side.

Wait, let me formalize:

For triangle QRS, the lengths from each vertex to the point of tangency on the adjacent side are equal. Specifically:

If the incircle touches QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T, then:

QU = QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 ?

Wait, no. Let me recall the general formula. In triangle ABC, with the incircle touching BC at D, AC at E, AB at F, then:

AF = AE = (AB + AC - BC)/2,

BD = BF = (AB + BC - AC)/2,

CD = CE = (BC + AC - AB)/2.

So applying this to triangle QRS, with the incircle touching QR at U, RS at V, QS at T.

Therefore:

QU = QT = (QS + QR - RS)/2,

Similarly, RU = RV = (QR + RS - QS)/2,

SV = ST = (RS + QS - QR)/2.

But in our problem, we have:

Length of QU = 14,

Length of RV = 27,

Length of ST = 17.

From above, QU = QT, so QT = 14. Also, since QT is equal to (QS + QR - RS)/2. Also, RV is equal to (QR + RS - QS)/2 = 27, and ST is equal to (RS + QS - QR)/2 = 17.

So let me write equations based on that.

Let me denote:

Let a = QR, b = RS, c = QS.

Then:

QU = (c + a - b)/2 = 14,

RV = (a + b - c)/2 = 27,

ST = (b + c - a)/2 = 17.

So we have three equations:

1) (c + a - b)/2 = 14 ⇒ c + a - b = 28

2) (a + b - c)/2 = 27 ⇒ a + b - c = 54

3) (b + c - a)/2 = 17 ⇒ b + c - a = 34

Now, we can solve these equations. Let me add equations 1, 2, and 3.

Adding left-hand sides: (c + a - b) + (a + b - c) + (b + c - a) = a + b + c.

Right-hand sides: 28 + 54 + 34 = 116.

Thus, a + b + c = 116.

Now, from equation 1: c + a - b = 28.

We can express variables in terms of others. Let me find expressions for a, b, c.

Alternatively, using the sum a + b + c = 116.

From equation 1: c + a - b = 28. Let me call this Equation (1).

Equation (2): a + b - c = 54. Equation (2)

Equation (3): b + c - a = 34. Equation (3)

Let me add Equations (1) and (2):

(c + a - b) + (a + b - c) = 28 + 54 ⇒ 2a = 82 ⇒ a = 41.

So QR = a = 41.

Now, substitute a = 41 into Equation (2): 41 + b - c = 54 ⇒ b - c = 54 - 41 = 13 ⇒ b = c +13.

Also, from Equation (3): b + c - a = 34. Since a=41, this becomes b + c -41 =34 ⇒ b + c = 75.

But since b = c +13, substitute into b + c =75:

(c +13) + c =75 ⇒ 2c +13 =75 ⇒ 2c=62 ⇒ c=31. Hence, c =31, which is QS =31.

Then, b = c +13 = 31 +13=44. So RS = b=44.

So now, we have:

QR = a =41,

RS = b=44,

QS = c=31.

Now, check if these values satisfy the original equations.

Check Equation (1): c + a -b =31+41 -44 = 72 -44=28 ✔️

Equation (2): a + b -c =41 +44 -31= 85 -31=54 ✔️

Equation (3): b + c -a =44 +31 -41=75 -41=34 ✔️

All good.

Now, the problem asks for x such that LengthOf(QT)=2x. Earlier, we had from the first part that QT=QU=14. Wait, but according to the incircle properties, QT was supposed to be (c + a - b)/2 =14. Which matches our calculation here. So QT=14, which equals 2x. Thus, 2x=14 ⇒x=7. So x=7, which corresponds to option B.

But wait, let me make sure there isn't anything else affecting this. Are there any other constraints that might influence this value?

Looking back, the problem states that:

- LengthOf(Line(Q,U)) is 14. Which we used as QU=14.

- LengthOf(Line(Q,T)) equals 2x, and also equals LengthOf(Line(Q,U)). Therefore, 2x=14 ⇒x=7. This seems straightforward.

However, maybe there's another way to approach this? Let me verify with another method.

Alternatively, considering the lengths of RU and RV. From earlier, RU = (a + b - c)/2. Wait, no. Wait, earlier we said that RV is equal to (a + b - c)/2. Wait, from the incircle properties, RU is the length from R to the point of tangency on QR. Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, we considered that:

For the incircle, the tangency points divide the sides into segments whose lengths are determined by the semiperimeter.

Wait, the standard formula is that for a triangle with sides of length a, b, c, the lengths from each vertex to the point of tangency on the adjacent side are:

For example, in triangle QRS:

- The tangency point on QR divides it into segments of length (semiperimeter - opposite side). Wait, let me clarify.

Semiperimeter s = (QR + RS + QS)/2 = (a + b + c)/2 = 116 /2 =58.

Then, the length from Q to the tangency point on QR is s - RS. Wait, yes! Because in the standard formula, the distance from vertex A to the tangency point on BC is s - BC. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the tangency point on BC is at distance s - AB from B, and s - AC from C. Wait, let me get precise.

In triangle ABC, with sides BC=a, AC=b, AB=c. Then the distance from A to the tangency point on BC is... Wait, no. The tangency point on BC is called D, then BD = s - AC, DC = s - AB. So in general, the tangency point on side BC (which is opposite A) is at distance s - AB from B, and s - AC from C.

Applying this to our triangle QRS. Let me consider:

- The tangency point on QR is U. So QR is the side opposite to S? No, QR is between Q and R. Wait, the side QR is between Q and R, so the tangency point on QR would correspond to the side opposite to S. Wait, perhaps my previous approach was wrong.

Wait, confusion arises here. Let me redo this properly.

Let me label the triangle QRS. Let me denote:

- Side QR: connects Q and R.

- Side RS: connects R and S.

- Side QS: connects Q and S.

The incircle touches each side once. The tangency points:

- On QR: let's say U.

- On RS: V.

- On QS: T.

Then, the distances from each vertex to the tangency points are:

For example, from Q to U (on QR) and from Q to T (on QS) should be equal. Similarly, from R to U (on QR) and from R to V (on RS) should be equal. And from S to V (on RS) and from S to T (on QS) should be equal.

This is because the two tangent segments from a single point outside the circle are equal in length.

So, from point Q, the two tangent segments to the circle are QU and QT. Therefore, QU = QT.

Similarly, from R, the tangent segments are RU and RV, so RU = RV.

From S, the tangent segments are SV and ST, so SV = ST.

Which aligns with the earlier equations.

Given that, then:

QU = QT = 14 (given), so QT = 14.

Also, RU = RV = 27 (given), so RU = 27.

And SV = ST = 17 (given), so ST =17.

So, with that, the previous equations hold.

Using the standard formula for the lengths:

QU = QT = s - RS,

where s is the semiperimeter.

Similarly, RU = RV = s - QS,

and SV = ST = s - QR.

Wait, let me confirm:

Yes, for example, the length from Q to the tangency point on QR is s - RS. Because:

In triangle QRS, the tangency point on QR divides QR into segments. The segment from Q to the tangency point is equal to (perimeter/2) - opposite side. The opposite side of QR is S. So yes, QU = s - RS.

Similarly, RU = s - QS,

and SV = s - QR.

So, let's compute s = (QR + RS + QS)/2 = (a + b + c)/2 = 116/2 = 58.

Then:

QU = s - RS = 58 - b = 14 ⇒ 58 - b =14 ⇒ b=58-14=44. Which matches our earlier value of b=44.

Similarly, RU = s - QS =58 - c =27 ⇒58 -c=27 ⇒c=58-27=31, which matches c=31.

Similarly, SV = s - QR =58 - a =17 ⇒58 -a=17 ⇒a=58-17=41, which matches a=41.

So all checks out.

Thus, the value of QT is 14, which equals 2x. Therefore, x=7. So the answer is B.

But just to ensure there isn't any alternative interpretation. For instance, could there be multiple circles tangent to those lines? Well, the problem specifies a single circle W, and all three lines QR, QS, RS are tangent to it. So it's the incircle. Therefore, the only possible configuration is the incircle, leading us to the same conclusion.

Another thing to check: the problem mentions that points U, V, T lie on the circle. Since they are points of tangency, they lie on the circle by definition. So that's consistent.

Hence, the answer should be x=7, which is option B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup involving triangle $ QRS $ and the incircle $ W $, which is tangent to the sides $ QR $, $ RS $, and $ QS $. The points $ U $, $ V $, and $ T $ are the points of tangency of the incircle with these respective sides.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables and Use Tangent Segment Properties

Let the side lengths of triangle $ QRS $ be:

- $ QR = a $
- $ RS = b $
- $ QS = c $

The **semiperimeter** of triangle $ QRS $ is:
$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

From the properties of tangents drawn from a common external point to a circle, the lengths of the segments formed on the sides of the triangle are:

- $ QU = QT = s - b $
- $ RU = RV = s - c $
- $ SV = ST = s - a $

---

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Lengths

From the problem, we're told:

- $ QU = 14 $
- $ RV = 27 $
- $ ST = 17 $

Substitute into the expressions derived above:

1. $ s - b = 14 $ ⟹ $ b = s - 14 $
2. $ s - c = 27 $ ⟹ $ c = s - 27 $
3. $ s - a = 17 $ ⟹ $ a = s - 17 $

Add all three equations to eliminate $ s $:

$$
(s - b) + (s - c) + (s - a) = 14 + 27 + 17 = 58
$$

$$
3s - (a + b + c) = 58
$$

Recall that $ a + b + c = 2s $, so substitute:

$$
3s - 2s = 58 \Rightarrow s = 58
$$

Now compute the individual side lengths:

- $ a = 58 - 17 = 41 $
- $ b = 58 - 14 = 44 $
- $ c = 58 - 27 = 31 $

---

### Step 3: Determine Value of $ x $

We are told:

- $ QT = 2x $
- $ QT = QU = 14 $ (from the problem statement)

So,
$$
2x = 14 \Rightarrow x = 7
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

Final Answer: B
