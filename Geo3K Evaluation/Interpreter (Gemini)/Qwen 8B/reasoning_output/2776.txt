Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a rectangle ABCD, right? And there are several angles labeled 1 through 8. We know that angle 2 is 40 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 8. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles.

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each corner is 90 degrees. That means angles at A, B, C, D (the ones formed by the sides) are all 90 degrees. But then there are these other angles mentioned—angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Wait, maybe those are angles formed by the diagonals?

The problem mentions lines AC and BD as diagonals because they're called diagonals of the rectangle. In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. Also, since it's a rectangle, the diagonals should split each other into two equal parts, which makes point E the midpoint of both diagonals. 

So, if I imagine drawing the diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E, which is their midpoint. Now, when diagonals intersect in a rectangle, they form vertical angles. The angles around the intersection point would be vertical angles. For example, angle between diagonal AC and side AB might be angle 1, and another angle next to it could be angle 2, etc. But how do these angles relate?

Wait, the problem says that angle 2 is 40 degrees. Let me think about triangle ABC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle. Wait, but the diagonals divide the rectangle into triangles. Let me consider triangle ABC. Wait, no, AC is a diagonal, so connecting A to C. Then, the intersection point E divides the diagonals into halves. So AE equals EC, BE equals ED.

Now, considering the angles formed at the intersection point E. When two diagonals cross, they create four angles. These angles are vertical angles. If angle 2 is 40 degrees, perhaps that's one of those angles formed by the diagonals. But wait, the problem also lists angles 1 through 8, which probably correspond to different angles in various places.

Let me check the given constraints again. It says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 40). Also, there are relationships like Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(8))), and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)), MeasureOf(Angle(7))). So angles 1=3, 2=4, 5=8, 6=7. So angle 8 is equal to angle 5. Maybe angle 5 and 8 are related to the same type of angles?

But first, let's focus on angle 2 being 40 degrees. Let me visualize the rectangle with diagonals crossing at E. Each diagonal splits the rectangle into two congruent triangles. In such a case, the diagonals bisect each other, so triangles ABE, BCE, CDE, and DAE are all congruent? Or maybe not necessarily congruent, but similar? Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, so yes, each half of the diagonals are equal. Therefore, triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. 

In triangle ABE, for instance, AE and BE are halves of the diagonals. Since the diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, their halves are equal. So AE = BE? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent, so AC = BD. Since E is the midpoint of both diagonals, then AE = EC and BE = ED. Therefore, AE = (AC)/2, BE = (BD)/2. But since AC = BD, then AE = BE. Therefore, triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle with legs AE and BE equal. 

Therefore, angles opposite those legs would be equal. Wait, in triangle ABE, angle at E is formed by the two diagonals. Wait, maybe angle at E is something else. Let me clarify. Let me label the angles properly. Suppose diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. Then, the angles around point E would be four angles: let's say angle AEB, angle BEC, angle CED, angle DEA. These angles are vertical angles, so angle AEB equals angle CED, and angle BEC equals angle DEA. Additionally, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle AEB + angle BEC = 180 degrees.

But in this case, angle 2 is given as 40 degrees. How does that fit in? Let me see. The problem mentions Angle(1), Angle(2), ..., up to Angle(8). Maybe these angles refer to specific angles in certain triangles or positions. For example, angle 2 could be one of the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. Let me think.

If we look at triangle ABC, but actually, the diagonals divide the rectangle into four triangles. Let me take triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angle at B is 90 degrees, since ABCD is a rectangle. Wait, no. Wait, angle at B in triangle ABE is part of the original rectangle's angle. Wait, the original angle at B is 90 degrees. However, in triangle ABE, the angles are angle at A, angle at B, and angle at E. Wait, angle at B here would be part of the original 90-degree angle. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe angles 1-8 refer to angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. For example, angle between AB and diagonal AC could be angle 1, angle between AB and diagonal BD could be angle 2, etc. Alternatively, maybe angles formed at the intersection point E. Let me try to think differently.

Since angle 2 is 40 degrees, and we need to find angle 8. Given that angle 2 equals angle 4, and angle 5 equals angle 8. Let me suppose that angle 2 is one of the angles created by the intersection of diagonals. Let me assume that angle 2 is one of the angles at point E, like angle AEB. If angle AEB is 40 degrees, then its vertical angle CED is also 40 degrees. Then, the adjacent angles would be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. So angle BEC and angle DEA would be 140 degrees each. 

But then, how does that relate to angles 1-8? Maybe angles 1 and 3 are the angles at the corners of the rectangle? No, because those are already 90 degrees. Wait, the problem states that the measures of angles at the corners (like angle ABC, which is 90 degrees) are fixed. Then, angles 1-8 are likely angles formed by the diagonals with the sides. 

For example, let's consider the angle between side AB and diagonal AC. This angle would be angle BAC. Similarly, the angle between side BC and diagonal BD would be angle CBD. These angles may be labeled as angles 1, 2, etc. Let me think.

Suppose angle 2 refers to angle between AB and diagonal BD. Wait, but BD connects B to D. So in triangle ABD, BD is a diagonal. The angle between AB and BD would be angle ABD. Similarly, other angles can be considered. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals. For example, if diagonals intersect at E, forming vertical angles. If angle AEB is 40 degrees, then angle AEB is 40°, making angle BEC = 140°, etc. Then, angles 1 and 3 could be the base angles of triangles formed by the diagonals. 

Wait, let's take triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, we have angle at E being 40 degrees (if angle AEB is 40°). Then, since triangle ABE has angles at A, B, and E. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. We know angle at E is 40°, angle at B is... Wait, angle at B in triangle ABE is part of the original rectangle's angle. Wait, in the rectangle, angle ABC is 90°, which is the angle at vertex B. But in triangle ABE, angle at B is the same as angle ABD? Because BD is a diagonal. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In the rectangle ABCD, the sides AB and BC meet at B with a 90° angle. Diagonal BD splits this angle into two angles: angle ABD and angle CBD. Let me call angle ABD as x and angle CBD as y. Then x + y = 90°. But how does this relate to the angles formed by the diagonals?

Also, since diagonals AC and BD intersect at E, which is the midpoint. So AE = EC, BE = ED. Also, in triangle ABE, AE = BE? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, diagonals are congruent, so AC = BD. Therefore, AE = AC/2 and BE = BD/2. Since AC = BD, then AE = BE. Therefore, triangle ABE is isosceles with AE = BE. Hence, angles opposite those sides would be equal. The sides AE and BE are equal, so the angles opposite them would be equal. Which angles are those?

In triangle ABE, side AE is opposite angle at B, and side BE is opposite angle at A. Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle ABE:

- Vertex A connected to B and E.
- Vertex B connected to A and E.
- Vertex E connected to A and B.

So, side opposite angle at A is BE, side opposite angle at B is AE, and side opposite angle at E is AB.

Wait, since AE = BE (because AC = BD, so AE = BE), then the sides opposite angles at B and A are equal. Therefore, angles at A and B in triangle ABE are equal. So angle at A (which is angle BAE) equals angle at B (which is angle ABE).

But angle at B in triangle ABE is angle ABE, which is part of the original angle at B in the rectangle. Since the original angle at B is 90°, which is split into angle ABE and angle CBD. So if angle ABE is equal to angle BAE, then those two angles add up to 90°, so each would be 45°, unless there's some other consideration.

Wait, but earlier we had angle at E in triangle ABE being 40°, which was given as angle 2. Wait, but this seems conflicting. Let me re-examine.

Earlier assumption: angle at E (angle AEB) is 40°, which is angle 2. Then, in triangle ABE, angles sum to 180°, so angle at A + angle at B + angle at E = 180°. If angle at E is 40°, then angles at A and B sum to 140°. If triangle ABE is isosceles with AE = BE, then angles at A and B are equal. Thus, each would be 70°. Therefore, angle BAE = angle ABE = 70°, and angle AEB = 40°.

But angle ABE is part of the original 90° angle at B. Therefore, angle ABE = 70°, which would mean angle CBD = 90° - 70° = 20°. Wait, but angle CBD is another angle. However, this leads us to a possible relationship between these angles. 

But how does this connect to angle 8? The question asks for angle 8. From the given constraints, angle 5 equals angle 8. So if we can find angle 5, we can get angle 8. Let me think about angle 5.

Assuming angle 5 is another angle formed by the diagonals. Perhaps angle 5 is the angle between diagonal BD and side AD? Or maybe angle between diagonal AC and side AD?

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to an angle in triangle CDE or something. Let me try to map out all angles.

Given that angle 2 is 40°, and angle 2 equals angle 4, and angle 1 equals angle 3, angle 5 equals angle 8, angle 6 equals angle 7. 

Let me consider that angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. For example, angle between AB and BD is angle ABD, which is 70° as per previous calculation. Wait, but earlier we thought angle ABE (part of that) was 70°, but angle ABD is angle between AB and BD, which would be angle ABE plus angle EBC? Wait, no. Wait, if E is the intersection point of diagonals, then BD goes from B to D, passing through E. So angle ABD is the angle between AB and BD, which is angle ABE. Earlier, we thought angle ABE was 70°, leading to angle ABD being 70°. But then angle 2 is supposed to be 40°, so this contradicts. So my initial assumption must be wrong.

Perhaps angle 2 is not angle ABE, but another angle. Let me rethink.

Maybe angle 2 is one of the angles formed at the intersection of diagonals. For example, angle AEB is 40°, which would make angle AEB = 40°, and then angle BEC = 140°, as adjacent angles are supplementary. Then, since angle AEB is 40°, angle BEC is 140°, angle CED is 40°, angle DEA is 140°. 

Then, angles 1 and 3 could be the angles at the vertices of the rectangle. Wait, but those are already 90°. Or maybe angles formed by the diagonals with the sides. For example, angle between AB and AC is angle BAC. Let me calculate that.

In triangle ABC, which is a right triangle because ABCD is a rectangle. AC is the hypotenuse. So angle BAC can be found using trigonometry. Let me denote AB as length 'a', BC as length 'b'. Then AC = sqrt(a² + b²). In triangle ABC, angle BAC is opposite BC and adjacent to AB. So tan(angle BAC) = BC / AB = b/a. 

However, without knowing the ratio of sides, it's hard to determine exact angles. But perhaps there's a relation based on the diagonals intersecting at E. Wait, but if angle AEB is 40°, then maybe we can use that to find relations.

Alternatively, maybe angle between diagonal AC and side AB is angle BAC, which we can relate to angle 2. Let me think. If angle between AB and AC is x, then angle between AB and BD (diagonal) would be another value. 

But since diagonals intersect at E, creating vertical angles. Let me consider that angle between diagonals AC and BD at point E is 40°, which is angle AEB = 40°, as before. Then, in triangle ABE, angles are 40°, and the other two angles sum to 140°, and since triangle ABE is isosceles (AE = BE), those two angles are equal. So each would be 70°, meaning angle at A (BAE) and angle at B (ABE) are 70° each. 

But angle BAE is angle between BA and AE, which is the same as angle BAC, since AE is half of AC. So angle BAC = 70°, which implies that in triangle ABC, angle at A is 70°, angle at B is 90°, so angle at C would be 180 - 70 - 90 = 20°. Wait, but angle at C in triangle ABC is angle ACB. But in reality, angle at C in triangle ABC is part of the rectangle's angle, which is 90°. Wait, this seems conflicting. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at C is angle ACB. But in the rectangle, angle at C is between BC and CD, which is 90°. However, in triangle ABC, angle at C is angle ACB, which is different. So maybe I need to consider triangle ABC. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, we have sides AB, BC, and AC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC. So angle ABC is 90°, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then, angle BAC is one acute angle, angle BCA is the other. Using trigonometry, tan(angle BAC) = BC / AB. But without knowing the sides, we can't compute exact values. However, if angle BAC is 70°, then angle BCA would be 20°, as above. 

But how does that relate to the given information that angle 2 is 40°? If angle BAC is 70°, which is angle 1, and angle 2 is 40°, which could be angle between AB and BD (as discussed earlier). 

Alternatively, angle 2 could be angle between BD and BC. Let me try to think. If angle ABE is 70°, then angle between BD and BC would be angle between BD and BC. Since BD is going from B to D, and BC is going from B to C. At point B, the angle between BC and BD is angle CBD. Earlier, if angle ABD is 70°, then angle CBD = angle ABC - angle ABD = 90° - 70° = 20°. So angle CBD is 20°. 

If angle 2 is angle CBD, which is 20°, but the problem says angle 2 is 40°, which conflicts. So that suggests my previous assumption is incorrect. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe angle 2 is not angle ABE or angle CBD, but another angle. Let me try to think of all angles formed by the diagonals and the sides.

When diagonals intersect at E, they form eight angles around point E. These angles come in pairs of vertical angles. There are four angles: let's say angle AEB, angle BEC, angle CED, angle DEA. These angles are either 40° or 140°, depending on the configuration. 

Additionally, each diagonal forms angles with the sides of the rectangle. For example, diagonal AC forms angles with AB and AD, and diagonal BD forms angles with AB and AD. 

Alternatively, maybe angles 1-8 are referring to the angles formed at the vertices of the rectangle by the diagonals. For example, at vertex A, the diagonal AC creates angle between AB and AC (let's call this angle 1), and between AD and AC (angle 3). Similarly, at vertex B, diagonal BD creates angles with AB and BC (angle 2 and angle 4?), etc. 

If that's the case, then at each corner, there are two angles formed by the diagonal and the sides. For example, at vertex A, diagonal AC splits the 90° angle into two angles: angle between AB and AC (say angle 1) and angle between AD and AC (angle 3). Similarly at other vertices. 

In this case, angle 2 could be one of these angles. For example, at vertex B, diagonal BD splits the 90° angle into two angles: angle between AB and BD (angle 2) and angle between BC and BD (angle 4). Given that angle 2 = 40°, then angle 4 = 40°, and the remaining angle at vertex B would be 90° - 40° = 50°, but wait, no—wait, at vertex B, the total angle is 90°, and diagonal BD splits it into two angles: angle ABD and angle CBD. So angle ABD + angle CBD = 90°. If angle ABD is 40°, then angle CBD is 50°, or vice versa. 

But according to the constraints, angle 2 = angle 4. So if angle 2 is one of these angles at vertex B, say angle ABD, then angle 4 would be the other angle at vertex B, which is angle CBD. So if angle 2 = angle 4, then angle ABD = angle CBD. But in a rectangle, unless it's a square, the diagonals don't split the angles equally. Wait, only in a square, the diagonals bisect the angles. In a general rectangle, the diagonals are congruent but do not bisect the angles unless it's a square. 

So if the rectangle isn't a square, the diagonals don't bisect the angles. Therefore, angle ABD ≠ angle CBD. But the constraint says angle 2 = angle 4, implying that angle ABD = angle CBD. This suggests that the rectangle must be a square. But the problem didn't state that it's a square; it just said it's a rectangle. So there's a contradiction here unless the rectangle is a square. 

Wait, but the problem gives angle 2 = 40°, which would imply that the rectangle is not a square, since in a square, the diagonals would split the 90° angles into 45° each. Therefore, there must be another interpretation of the angles 1-8. 

Perhaps the angles 1-8 are not the angles at the vertices, but the angles formed at the intersection point E of the diagonals. As previously mentioned, there are four angles at point E: two pairs of vertical angles. If angle 2 is one of these, say angle AEB = 40°, then angle AEB = angle CED = 40°, and the other two angles at point E (angle BEC and angle DEA) would be 140° each. 

Then, given that angle 1 = angle 3 and angle 2 = angle 4, perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are the angles at the intersection point E. Wait, but there are only four angles at E. So maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are the smaller angles (40°), and angles 2 and 4 are the larger ones (140°)? But the problem says angle 2 = 40°, which would conflict. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is one of the smaller angles (40°), and angle 4 is another small angle, while angles 1 and 3 are large angles (140°). But then, angle 2 = angle 4 = 40°, and angle 1 = angle 3 = 140°. 

But how does this help us find angle 8? The problem says angle 5 = angle 8. Let's assume that angles 5 and 8 are among the angles formed at the intersection point E. For example, angle 5 could be one of the larger angles (140°), and angle 8 would be equal to it. But if angle 5 is 140°, then angle 8 would be 140°, which isn't among the answer choices (since options are 40, 50, 80, 100). So that can't be. 

Alternatively, maybe angles 5 and 8 are angles formed elsewhere. Let me think about the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, triangle ABE has angles: angle at E (40°), angle at A (let's say x), angle at B (y). We know x + y + 40 = 180, so x + y = 140. Since AE = BE (because diagonals are equal and E is midpoint), triangle ABE is isosceles with AE = BE, so angles at A and B are equal. Therefore, x = y = 70°. 

So angle at A (x) is 70°, which is angle BAE. This angle BAE is the angle between BA and AE, which is part of the diagonal AC. So angle BAE is 70°, which is angle between BA and AC. Similarly, angle ABE is 70°, which is the angle between AB and BE, which is part of diagonal BD. 

So angle between AB and BD is 70°, which would be angle ABE. But the problem says angle 2 is 40°, so this suggests that angle 2 is not this angle. 

Wait, but maybe angle 2 is the angle between AC and BD at point E, which is 40°. If angle AEB is 40°, then angle 2 = 40°, and angle 4 (its vertical angle) is also 40°, and the other two angles at E are 140°. 

Now, angle 1 and angle 3 are equal. What could they be? Maybe angles formed in other triangles. For example, in triangle ABE, the angles at A and B are 70°, which are angles BAE and ABE. These could be angles 1 and 3. So angle 1 = angle 3 = 70°. 

Then, angle 5 and angle 8 are equal. Let me think. If angle 5 is one of the angles in another triangle. For example, in triangle CED, which is congruent to triangle ABE. Angle at E is 40°, angles at C and D would be 70° each. So angle at C (angle DCE) is 70°, and angle at D (angle EDC) is 70°. 

Alternatively, angle 5 could be one of the angles at the vertices. For example, at vertex C, the diagonal AC forms an angle with side CB. Let me think. At vertex C, diagonal AC meets side CB. The angle between CB and CA is angle ACB, which in triangle ABC is 20°, as earlier. Wait, earlier we thought angle BAC is 70°, angle at B is 90°, so angle at C in triangle ABC is 20°. So angle ACB is 20°. 

If angle 5 is angle ACB, which is 20°, then angle 8 would also be 20°, but that's not one of the options. So this approach might be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is one of the angles at point E. Like, if angle 5 is one of the larger angles at point E, which is 140°, then angle 8 would also be 140°, which again isn't an option. 

This suggests that my current assumptions are incorrect. Let me try another approach. 

Since angle 2 = 40°, and it's equal to angle 4. Let's assume angle 2 and angle 4 are angles formed at the intersection of diagonals. If angle 2 is one of the smaller angles at point E, then angle 2 = 40°, and angle 4 is another small angle. But since there are only two types of angles at point E (small and large), and angle 2 = angle 4, this implies that both are small angles, meaning that the diagonals intersect at 40°, making the other angles 140°. 

Now, if we consider the triangles formed by the diagonals. In triangle ABE, as before, angles at A and B are 70°, and at E is 40°. These angles at A and B are angles between the sides and the diagonals. So angle BAE = 70°, which is angle between BA and AC, and angle ABE = 70°, angle between AB and BD. 

Wait, but if angle ABE is 70°, then at vertex B, the angle between AB and BD is 70°, and the angle between BC and BD would be 90° - 70° = 20°, since the total angle at B is 90°. So angle between BC and BD is 20°. 

Similarly, at vertex D, the angle between DC and DA is 90°, and diagonal BD splits it into two angles. If angle between DC and BD is similar to the angle at B. 

Now, let's consider angle 5 and angle 8. The problem states angle 5 = angle 8. Let me assume that angle 5 is the angle between diagonal BD and side DC, which we just found to be 20°. Then angle 8 would also be 20°, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the angle between diagonal AC and side DC. Let me think. At vertex D, diagonal AC meets DC. The angle between DC and AC would be angle ACD. In triangle ADC, which is a right triangle (since ABCD is a rectangle), angle at D is 90°, and AC is the hypotenuse. So angle ACD is equal to angle BAC, which we previously determined as 70°. Wait, no, in triangle ABC, angle BAC is 70°, and in triangle ADC, angle ACD would be equal to angle BAC, due to the symmetry of the rectangle. So angle ACD = 70°. 

If angle 5 is angle ACD = 70°, then angle 8 = 70°, which isn't an option either. 

Wait, but the answer choices include 50, 80, etc. Let me think again. 

Maybe the key lies in the fact that angle 2 is 40°, and angle 2 equals angle 4, and angle 1 equals angle 3, and angle 5 equals angle 8, and angle 6 equals angle 7. 

Let me consider that the sum of angle 1 and angle 2 is 90°, as stated in the constraints: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 90). Wait, the user wrote "SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 90)" — this might mean MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 90°. 

Ah! This is crucial. The constraint says that the sum of angle 1 and angle 2 is 90 degrees. So MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 90°. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 40°, this implies MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 50°. 

And since MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = MeasureOf(Angle(3)), then Angle(3) is also 50°. 

Now, the question is asking for MeasureOf(Angle(8)). From the constraints, MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = MeasureOf(Angle(8)). So if we can find MeasureOf(Angle(5)), we can get Angle(8). 

But how do we relate Angle(5)? Let me try to identify what Angle(5) represents. 

Let me recall that the angles are labeled as Angle(1) through Angle(8). Given that Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, and Angle(2)=40°, so Angle(1)=50°. 

Now, let's think about Angle(1). If Angle(1) is one of the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides, like the angle between AB and AC (angle BAC), which we previously thought was 70°, but now it's 50°. Wait, this suggests that my previous assumption about angle BAC being 70° was wrong. 

So if Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, then Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, which fits. So Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°. 

What could Angle(1) represent? If Angle(1) is the angle between AB and AC (angle BAC), then it would be 50°. Let's explore this. 

In triangle ABC, which is a right triangle at B, with angle BAC = 50°, then angle ACB = 90° - 50° = 40°. So angle ACB = 40°. 

Now, angle ACB is the angle between AC and CB, which is at point C. This angle is 40°. But how does this relate to other angles? 

Let me consider that Angle(5) might be this angle ACB = 40°, but then Angle(8) would also be 40°, which is option A. But wait, the answer choices include A as 40°, which is possible. But let me verify. 

Alternatively, Angle(5) could be another angle. Let me think about the diagram again. 

If Angle(1) is angle BAC = 50°, Angle(2) is angle ABD = 40°, then Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, which fits. 

Now, Angle(5) could be angle between diagonal BD and side BC, which would be angle CBD. Since angle ABC is 90°, and angle ABD is 40°, then angle CBD = 90° - 40° = 50°. So angle CBD = 50°, which could be Angle(5). Then, Angle(8) = Angle(5) = 50°, which would be option B. 

But let me check this. 

If Angle(5) is angle CBD = 50°, then Angle(8) is also 50°, which would be option B. 

But why would Angle(5) be angle CBD? Let me think about how the angles are numbered. 

The problem lists Angles(1) through (8). If Angle(1) is angle BAC = 50°, Angle(2) is angle ABD = 40°, then what about Angle(3) and Angle(4)? Since Angle(1) = Angle(3), and Angle(2) = Angle(4), then Angle(3) is also 50°, and Angle(4) is 40°. 

Now, Angle(5) and Angle(6) could be other angles. For example, Angle(5) could be angle BCD, but that's 90°, which doesn't fit. Or it could be angle between diagonal AC and side BC, which is angle ACB = 40°, as before. 

Wait, if Angle(5) is angle ACB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, which is option A. But this would mean Angle(5) = Angle(8) = 40°. 

But earlier, we had Angle(5) as angle CBD = 50°, which would give Angle(8) = 50°, option B. 

Which one is correct? Let me try to trace all angles. 

In triangle ABC, we have:

- Angle at A: angle BAC = 50°
- Angle at B: 90°
- Angle at C: angle ACB = 40°

So angle ACB = 40°. This is the angle between AC and CB at point C. 

Now, at point C, the diagonal BD passes through, splitting the angle at C. Wait, no, diagonal BD connects B to D. So at point C, the sides are BC and CD. The diagonal AC connects to C, and diagonal BD passes through point E. 

Wait, at point C, the angle between BC and CD is 90°, as it's a rectangle. The diagonal AC splits this angle into two parts: angle ACB (40°) and angle ACD. Since the whole angle at C is 90°, angle ACD = 90° - 40° = 50°. 

So angle ACD = 50°. This could be Angle(5) or Angle(6). 

If Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, which is option B. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is angle ACB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, option A. 

How to determine which is Angle(5)? 

We need to consider the labeling of the angles. The problem mentions Angles(1)-(8), but it doesn't specify their positions. However, we know that Angle(5) = Angle(8), and Angle(6) = Angle(7). 

Let me consider that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are corresponding angles in some triangles. 

For example, angle ACB = 40° is at point C, and angle ACD = 50° is also at point C. These are two angles formed by diagonal AC at point C. 

If Angle(5) is one of these, say angle ACB = 40°, and Angle(8) is another angle. But since Angle(5) = Angle(8), this would suggest that Angle(8) is also 40°, which would be option A. 

But earlier, we had Angle(1) = 50°, Angle(2) = 40°, and Angle(5) could be 50°. Let me think about the other angles. 

At point D, the diagonal AC meets DC. The angle between DC and AC is angle ACD = 50°, as above. At point D, the diagonal BD meets DC and DA. The angle between DC and BD is angle CDB. 

In triangle BCD, which is a right triangle at C, with angle at C being 90°, and diagonal BD dividing it. 

Wait, but BD is a diagonal from B to D. In triangle BCD, angle at C is 90°, and BD is a diagonal. Let's find angle CBD. Earlier, we found that at point B, angle ABD = 40°, so angle CBD = 50°, as angle ABC is 90°. 

So angle CBD = 50°, which is at point B. 

Now, if we consider Angle(5) as angle CBD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, which is option B. 

But how do we know which angle is labeled as 5? 

Given that the problem includes multiple angles, and the constraints are:

- Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°
- Angle(1) = Angle(3)
- Angle(2) = Angle(4)
- Angle(5) = Angle(8)
- Angle(6) = Angle(7)

Assuming Angle(1) is 50°, Angle(2) is 40°, then Angle(3) = 50°, Angle(4) = 40°. 

Now, what about Angles(5) and (6)? Let's think about the other angles formed by the diagonals. 

For example, at point D, diagonal BD creates angle between DC and BD (angle CDB), which we've determined as angle CBD = 50°, but wait, angle CDB is at point D. 

Wait, angle CDB is part of triangle CDB. Let me calculate it. In triangle CDB, we have:

- Right angle at C (since ABCD is a rectangle).
- Side CB is one leg, CD is the other leg.
- Diagonal BD is the hypotenuse.

So, angle at D (angle CDB) can be found using trigonometry. If we consider triangle CDB, angle at D is opposite to CB and adjacent to CD. So tan(angle CDB) = CB / CD. 

But without knowing the sides, it's hard to compute directly. However, we know that in triangle ABC, angle BAC = 50°, angle ACB = 40°. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB = CD and BC = AD. 

Let me denote AB = CD = a, BC = AD = b. Then, in triangle ABC, tan(angle BAC) = BC / AB = b/a = tan(50°). So b/a = tan(50°). 

In triangle CDB, angle CDB is the angle at D, which is the same as angle ACB in triangle ABC, due to the symmetry of the rectangle. Wait, no. In triangle CDB, angle at D is angle CDB, which is equal to angle ACB in triangle ABC because of the rectangle's properties. Wait, no, that might not hold. 

Actually, in triangle CDB, angle at D is angle CDB, which is complementary to angle CBD. Since in triangle CDB, angle at C is 90°, angle at D is angle CDB, and angle at B is angle CBD. So angle CDB + angle CBD = 90°. 

Earlier, we found angle CBD = 50°, so angle CDB = 90° - 50° = 40°. 

Thus, angle CDB = 40°. This could be Angle(5) or Angle(8). 

If Angle(5) is angle CDB = 40°, then Angle(8) is also 40°, which is option A. But this conflicts with our earlier idea that Angle(5) could be 50°. 

This suggests that there are multiple possibilities depending on which angles are labeled as 5 and 8. 

But let's go back to the constraints. The problem says that Angle(5) = Angle(8). If Angle(5) is angle CDB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, option A. But if Angle(5) is angle CBD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, option B. 

To resolve this, let's recall that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are related through the constraints. Also, we know that Angle(6) = Angle(7). 

Let me think about all angles:

- Angle(1): 50° (from earlier)
- Angle(2): 40°
- Angle(3): 50°
- Angle(4): 40°
- Angle(5): ?
- Angle(6): ?
- Angle(7): ?
- Angle(8): ?

Now, let's consider the remaining angles. These could include angles formed at points C and D. 

For example:

- Angle at C: angle ACB = 40°, angle ACD = 50°
- Angle at D: angle CDB = 40°, angle ADB = ?

Wait, at point D, diagonal BD creates angles. Let me consider angle ADB. In triangle ADB, which is a right triangle at D (since ABCD is a rectangle). 

Wait, no. In triangle ADB, point D is connected to A and B. Since ABCD is a rectangle, DA is perpendicular to DC, and DB is a diagonal. So angle at D in triangle ADB is angle ADB. 

To find angle ADB, we can note that in triangle ADB, we have sides AD = b, AB = a, and diagonal DB = sqrt(a² + b²). 

Using trigonometry, tan(angle ADB) = AB / AD = a/b. 

From earlier, in triangle ABC, tan(angle BAC) = b/a = tan(50°), so b/a = tan(50°), hence a/b = cot(50°). 

Thus, tan(angle ADB) = cot(50°) = tan(40°), since cot(x) = tan(90° - x). So angle ADB = 40°. 

So angle ADB = 40°, which is at point D. This could be Angle(5) or Angle(6). 

Now, we have several angles:

- Angle(1) = 50°
- Angle(2) = 40°
- Angle(3) = 50°
- Angle(4) = 40°
- Angle(5) = ? (could be 40°, 50°, or others)
- Angle(6) = ?
- Angle(7) = ?
- Angle(8) = ?

Let me list all identified angles:

1. Angle BAC = 50° (Angle(1))
2. Angle ABD = 40° (Angle(2))
3. Angle ABE = 70° (but not sure if this is used)
4. Angle CBD = 50° (at point B)
5. Angle ACB = 40° (at point C)
6. Angle ACD = 50° (at point C)
7. Angle CDB = 40° (at point D)
8. Angle ADB = 40° (at point D)
9. Other angles like angle AED, etc., at point E.

Now, the problem states that Angle(5) = Angle(8). Let's assume Angle(5) is one of these identified angles. 

For example, if Angle(5) is angle ACB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, option A. 

Or if Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, option B. 

But how to determine which one is Angle(5)? 

Looking back, the problem mentions that Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, which we used to find Angle(1) = 50°. Now, what about other sums? Are there any other constraints? 

The problem also mentions that Angle(6) = Angle(7). Let's see if we can find those. 

For example, Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be angles at points C and D. For example, Angle(6) could be angle ACD = 50°, and Angle(7) could be angle ADB = 40°, but they are not equal. 

Alternatively, Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be angles at point E. For example, if Angle(6) is 140°, and Angle(7) is also 140°, but that would require more analysis. 

But let's consider that at point E, the angles are 40°, 140°, 40°, 140°. So if Angle(5) and Angle(8) are among these, but Angle(5) = Angle(8), then they could be 40° or 140°. 

If Angle(5) is 40°, then Angle(8) is 40°, option A. If Angle(5) is 140°, then Angle(8) is 140°, which is not an option. 

But from earlier, we have several angles of 40° and 50°. Let me think about the remaining angles. 

If Angle(5) is angle CDB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, option A. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, option B. 

But how to decide? Let me think about the number of angles. 

We have:

- Angle(1) = 50°
- Angle(2) = 40°
- Angle(3) = 50°
- Angle(4) = 40°
- Remaining angles: 5, 6, 7, 8. 

These remaining angles could be:

- Angle(5): 40° (e.g., angle CDB)
- Angle(6): 50° (e.g., angle ACD)
- Angle(7): 50° (another angle)
- Angle(8): 40° (matching Angle(5))

But this would satisfy Angle(5) = Angle(8) = 40°, and Angle(6) = Angle(7) = 50°. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) = 50° and Angle(8) = 50°, then Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be 40° and 40°, but that would require two angles of 40°, which are available. 

But how to know which one is correct? 

Let me recall that in the problem statement, the constraints include:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))) → Angle(2) = 40°, Angle(4) = 40°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))) → Angle(1) = 50°, Angle(3) = 50°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(8))) → Angle(5) = Angle(8)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)), MeasureOf(Angle(7))) → Angle(6) = Angle(7)

If we assume that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are both 40°, then that would leave Angle(6) and Angle(7) to be 50° each, since we have angles of 50° left. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) and Angle(8) are both 50°, then Angle(6) and Angle(7) would be 40° each. 

But which scenario is consistent with the diagram?

Let me think about the angles at point E. The angles at E are 40° and 140°. If Angle(5) and Angle(8) are among these, and Angle(5) = Angle(8), then they must both be 40° or both be 140°. 

If they are both 40°, then Angle(5) and Angle(8) are the smaller angles at E. If they are both 140°, then they are the larger angles. 

But if Angle(5) and Angle(8) are 40°, then this matches with the existing angles of 40° (Angles 2, 4, and possibly others). 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) and Angle(8) are 140°, then they would be the larger angles at E. 

But since the answer choices include 50, 80, 100, and 40, and 140 is not an option, it's likely that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are 50°, which is option B, or 40°, option A. 

But how to decide? 

Let me go back to the sum of angles. 

If Angle(5) and Angle(8) are both 50°, then we have:

- Angle(1) = 50°
- Angle(2) = 40°
- Angle(3) = 50°
- Angle(4) = 40°
- Angle(5) = 50°
- Angle(6) = 50°
- Angle(7) = 50°
- Angle(8) = 50°

But this would mean that most angles are 50°, except 2 and 4. This might be possible. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) and Angle(8) are 40°, then:

- Angle(1) = 50°
- Angle(2) = 40°
- Angle(3) = 50°
- Angle(4) = 40°
- Angle(5) = 40°
- Angle(6) = 40°
- Angle(7) = 40°
- Angle(8) = 40°

But this would mean many angles are 40°, which might also be possible. 

But how to determine which is correct? 

Let me think about the remaining angles. We have identified:

- Angle(1) = 50° (angle BAC)
- Angle(2) = 40° (angle ABD)
- Angle(3) = 50° (angle BAC at another place?)
- Angle(4) = 40° (angle ABD at another place?)
- Angle(5) and Angle(8) are unknown
- Angle(6) and Angle(7) are equal

If Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°, and Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be 40° each. 

This would give:

- Angle(5) = 50°
- Angle(6) = 40°
- Angle(7) = 40°
- Angle(8) = 50°

This satisfies all constraints. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, and Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be 50° each. 

Both scenarios are possible, but we need to determine which one is correct based on the given constraints. 

Let me consider that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are not among the angles already accounted for (Angles 1-4). 

If Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then it's new, and Angle(8) = 50°, which is option B. 

If Angle(5) is angle CDB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°, option A. 

But how to decide? 

Let me think about the symmetry. In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. The angles formed by the diagonals with the sides are symmetric. 

If angle BAC = 50°, then angle ACD = 50°, as well. Similarly, angle ABD = 40°, so angle CDB = 40°. 

Therefore, Angle(5) could be 50°, and Angle(8) = 50°, or Angle(5) = 40°, and Angle(8) = 40°. 

But which one is it? 

Let me recall that in the problem, the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(1)) and MeasureOf(Angle(2)) is 90°, which we used to find Angle(1) = 50°. This suggests that Angle(1) and Angle(2) are adjacent angles at a vertex, adding up to 90°. 

If Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, then they are adjacent angles at a vertex, like at point B or point A. 

For example, at point B, Angle(2) is angle ABD = 40°, and Angle(1) could be angle ABC - angle ABD = 90° - 40° = 50°, which would be angle CBD. Wait, no. At point B, the total angle is 90°, and if Angle(2) is angle ABD = 40°, then the remaining angle at B is 50°, which could be angle CBD. 

But this would mean that Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, adding to 90°. 

If Angle(1) is angle CBD = 50°, then Angle(1) = 50°, and Angle(2) = 40°, adding to 90°. 

In this case, Angle(1) is at point B, and Angle(2) is at point B as well. 

But then, Angle(1) and Angle(2) are at the same vertex, which might not be allowed, but the problem doesn't specify their locations. 

However, this suggests that Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, and they are at the same vertex, adding to 90°. 

Now, if Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, and Angle(8) = 50°, then this would make sense. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is angle CDB = 40°, then Angle(8) = 40°. 

But which is it? 

Let me think about the labeling of the angles. If Angle(1) is at point B (angle CBD = 50°), and Angle(2) is at point B (angle ABD = 40°), then they are at the same point, which is possible. 

Then, Angle(5) and Angle(8) could be at other points. For example, Angle(5) could be angle ACD = 50°, and Angle(8) = 50°, or Angle(5) could be angle CDB = 40°, and Angle(8) = 40°. 

But how to determine which one? 

Let me consider that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are not at the same vertex. If Angle(5) is at point C (angle ACD = 50°), and Angle(8) is at point D (angle CDB = 40°), but they must be equal. This would mean 50° = 40°, which is false. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is at point D (angle ADB = 40°), and Angle(8) is at point C (angle ACB = 40°), then they are equal. This would mean Angle(5) = 40°, and Angle(8) = 40°, option A. 

This seems plausible. 

So, if Angle(5) is angle ADB = 40°, and Angle(8) is angle ACB = 40°, then they are equal. 

But how did we get angle ADB = 40°? Earlier, we found that in triangle ADB, angle ADB = 40°, because tan(angle ADB) = a/b = cot(50°) = tan(40°). 

Yes, this makes sense. So angle ADB = 40°, and angle ACB = 40°, because in triangle ABC, angle ACB = 40°. 

Thus, Angle(5) and Angle(8) are both 40°, making the answer A. 

But wait, this conflicts with the earlier possibility of Angle(5) being 50°. 

But let me double-check: 

- Angle(1) = 50° (angle BAC)
- Angle(2) = 40° (angle ABD)
- Angle(3) = 50° (angle BAC at another location, like angle CAD?)
- Angle(4) = 40° (angle ABD at another location, like angle CBD?)
- Angle(5) = 40° (angle ADB)
- Angle(6) = 50° (angle ACD)
- Angle(7) = 50° (angle something else)
- Angle(8) = 40° (angle ACB)

This setup satisfies all constraints: 

- Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 50 + 40 = 90
- Angle(1) = Angle(3) = 50
- Angle(2) = Angle(4) = 40
- Angle(5) = Angle(8) = 40
- Angle(6) = Angle(7) = 50

This works! 

So in this case, Angle(8) = 40°, which is option A. 

But wait, the answer choices include A as 40°, so this would make the answer A. 

However, earlier I thought Angle(5) could be 50°, but this scenario shows it's 40°. 

But let me confirm once more. 

If Angle(5) is angle ADB = 40°, and Angle(8) is angle ACB = 40°, then they are equal. 

Yes, this satisfies all conditions. 

Therefore, the measure of Angle(8) is 40°, which is option A. 

But wait, the problem states that m∠2 = 40, and asks for m∠8. If Angle(8) is also 40°, then the answer is A. 

But let me check if there's any mistake in this reasoning. 

Another way: since angle 2 is 40°, which is angle ABD, and angle 8 is angle ACB, which is also 40°, because in the right triangle ABC, angle at C is 40°, which is equal to angle ABD. 

This makes sense because in a rectangle, the diagonals create similar triangles. 

Therefore, the measure of angle 8 is 40°, option A. 

But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought where angle 5 was 50°, but now it's 40°. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) would also be 50°, option B. 

But how to decide? 

Let me recall that in the constraints, Angle(5) and Angle(8) are equal, and Angle(6) and Angle(7) are equal. 

If Angle(5) is 40°, then Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be 50°, as we saw. 

This fits all constraints. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is 50°, then Angle(6) and Angle(7) could be 40°. 

Both scenarios are possible, but how to know? 

Let me think about the remaining angles. 

If Angle(5) is 40°, then Angle(8) is 40°, and the remaining angles (6 and 7) are 50° each. 

If Angle(5) is 50°, then Angle(8) is 50°, and the remaining angles (6 and 7) are 40° each. 

Both scenarios are valid, but the problem provides answer choices including 40 and 50. 

But the problem states that Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, which gave us Angle(1) = 50°, and Angle(2) = 40°. 

If Angle(5) is 50°, then it would be Angle(5) = Angle(8) = 50°, and the answer would be B. 

But how to decide between A and B? 

Let me revisit the earlier steps. 

We had in triangle ABC, angle BAC = 50°, angle ACB = 40°. 

If Angle(1) is angle BAC = 50°, then Angle(1) = 50°. 

If Angle(5) is angle ACB = 40°, then Angle(5) = 40°, and Angle(8) = 40°. 

This would mean that Angle(5) is 40°, and Angle(8) is 40°. 

Alternatively, if Angle(5) is angle ACD = 50°, then Angle(8) = 50°. 

But which one is it? 

Let me think about the naming of the angles. The problem lists Angles(1) through (8), but it doesn't specify their exact positions. However, the constraint that Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90° suggests that they are adjacent angles at a single vertex, adding to 90°. 

If Angle(1) is 50° and Angle(2) is 40°, they are at the same vertex, like at point B. 

At point B, the angle between AB and BD is 40° (Angle(2)), and the angle between BC and BD is 50° (Angle(1)), adding to 90°. 

If Angle(1) is the angle between BC and BD (50°), and Angle(2) is the angle between AB and BD (40°), then Angle(1) = 50°, Angle(2) = 40°. 

Now, Angle(5) could be the angle between DC and AC at point C, which is 50° (angle ACD), and Angle(8) would be the same. 

Alternatively, Angle(5) could be the angle between DC and BD at point D, which is 40° (angle CDB), and Angle(8) = 40°. 

But how to determine which is Angle(5)? 

Let me consider that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are not at the same vertex. If Angle(5) is at point C (angle ACD = 50°), and Angle(8) is at point D (angle CDB = 40°), they are not equal. 

But if Angle(5) is at point D (angle CDB = 40°), and Angle(8) is at point C (angle ACB = 40°), then they are equal. 

This would mean Angle(5) = 40°, and Angle(8) = 40°. 

Thus, the answer is A. 

But this depends on the assumption that Angle(5) is at point D and Angle(8) is at point C. 

Given that the problem provides answer choices, and both 40 and 50 are options, but the calculation shows that Angle(5) and Angle(8) could be 40° or 50°, I need to find a way to choose between them. 

Wait, let me think about the total of all angles. 

In the rectangle, the sum of all angles at each vertex is 90°, and the angles formed by the diagonals add up to 360° around the intersection point E. 

But this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, let me consider the triangle formed by the diagonals. 

At point E, the angles are 40° and 140°. 

If Angle(5) and Angle(8) are 40°, then they are part of the smaller angles at E. 

If they are 50°, then they are not part of the angles at E. 

But since the problem states that Angle(5) and Angle(8) are equal, and the only possible equal angles from the known angles are 40° and 50°, it's possible that the correct answer is 50°, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, let me recall that in the beginning, I assumed that Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, adding to 90°. 

If Angle(1) is 50°, and Angle(2) is 40°, then Angle(1) is at a vertex, and Angle(2) is at another vertex. 

If Angle(5) is 50°, then it's at another vertex, and Angle(8) is also 50°. 

But this would mean that there are three angles of 50° (Angles 1, 3, 5, 8), and two angles of 40° (Angles 2, 4). 

This is possible. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. 

However, in standard problems like this, often the answer is 50°, as it complements the given 40°. 

But I need to make a decision. 

Given that Angle(1) + Angle(2) = 90°, and Angle(2) =
