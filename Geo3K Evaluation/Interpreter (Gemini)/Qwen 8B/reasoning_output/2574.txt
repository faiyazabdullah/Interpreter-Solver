MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out the key points and constraints provided.

We have a circle named Circle(K). Points G, H, J, and L lie on this circle. So, all these points are on the circumference of circle K. 

Next, there's a line segment GJ which is stated to be a diameter of the circle. That means points G and J are at opposite ends of the circle, passing through the center K. Since it's a diameter, the length of GJ should be twice the radius of the circle. Also, since K is the center, points G, H, J, and L are all radii away from K? Wait, no—wait, the problem says that lines KH, KG, and KJ are radii. Because it states IsRadiusOf(Line(K,H), Circle(K)) etc. So, each of those lines is a radius. Therefore, K is the center of the circle, so all those points (H, G, J) are on the circumference, making KH, KG, KJ radii. 

So, K is the center. Then, line GJ is a diameter, meaning that K lies on the midpoint of GJ. That makes sense because the diameter passes through the center. 

Now, angle H, K, J is given as 122 degrees. The measure of angle H-K-J is 122 degrees. Since K is the center, points H, K, J form a triangle with two sides being radii (KH and KJ) and the included angle at K. Therefore, triangle HKJ is an isosceles triangle with KH = KJ (both radii). 

Wait, but angle at K is 122 degrees. So, maybe we can find some arc measures here. Since angles subtended at the center correspond to arcs. For example, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But here, angle H-K-J is a central angle, right? Because the vertex is at the center. So, the measure of angle H-K-J equals the measure of the arc between H and J. So, arc HJ would be equal to 122 degrees. 

But wait, the problem also mentions that MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(H,K,J)), which is 122. So that confirms that arc HJ is 122 degrees. 

Then, there's another part about Arc(GLJ). Wait, the question asks for m∠GLJ? Or is it the measure of arc GLJ? Wait, the original question says: "Find m ∠GLJ." Wait, no, the user wrote:

"G J is a diameter of ⊙K. Find m ∠GLJ."

Wait, but the original problem might have had some formatting issues. Let me check again.

The user wrote:

"Find m ∠GLJ."

But looking back at the problem statement, they mentioned "Arc(G,J)" and "Arc(G,L,J)". Wait, perhaps there was a typo. Let me recheck the problem's exact wording.

In the problem description, after the list of constraints, the question is:

"G J is a diameter of ⊙K. Find m ∠GLJ."

So, the question is asking for the measure of angle GLJ. However, in the constraints, there's mention of Arc(G,J) and Arc(G,L,J). Maybe that's a misformatting? Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be arc GLJ?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is formed by points G, L, J. So angle at point L, with segments GL and JL. But the notation ∠GLJ would mean the angle at point L between points G, L, J. So, vertex at L, with segments LG and LJ.

But how do we find that measure? Let's think.

First, since GJ is a diameter, then points G and J are endpoints of a diameter. Point L is another point on the circle. So, we need to find the measure of angle GLJ. Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally: Circle with center K. Points G and J are endpoints of a diameter. Point L is somewhere else on the circle. We need to find the measure of angle GLJ. 

Since L is on the circle, triangle GLJ has vertices on the circle. To find angle at L, maybe we can use properties related to inscribed angles or something else.

Alternatively, since GJ is a diameter, and L is a point on the circle, then angle GLJ could be related to the arc it intercepts. Wait, angle at L intercepting arc GJ? Wait, no. In general, an inscribed angle over an arc is half the measure of the arc. But angle at L intercepting arc GJ would be half the measure of arc GJ. But what's the measure of arc GJ?

Since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ would be a semicircle, so 180 degrees. Therefore, if angle GLJ intercepts arc GJ, then the measure of angle GLJ would be half of 180°, which is 90°. Wait, but that would make angle GLJ a right angle. However, that depends on whether angle GLJ intercepts arc GJ.

Wait, but angle at L intercepts arc GJ only if the angle is formed by chords LG and LJ. So, yes, angle GLJ intercepts arc GJ. Therefore, measure of angle GLJ would be half of arc GJ. Since arc GJ is 180°, angle GLJ is 90°, which would be option A. But wait, why isn't there more consideration of the position of point L?

Wait, but in the problem, there's also information about arc HJ being 122°, and that arc HJ equals angle H-K-J. Also, point L is another point on the circle. How does point L relate to the rest?

Wait, but the problem didn't specify where point L is located. It just said that L lies on the circle. But in the constraints, there's an Arc(G,L,J). Maybe that's referring to arc GLJ, but perhaps there's more context. Wait, maybe the problem refers to arc from G to J passing through L. But unless we know where L is, we can't determine the measure. However, since the problem gives us information about arc HJ being 122°, maybe we can infer something about point L?

Wait, the problem also says that MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(H,K,J)), which is 122°, and that Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)),122). So, arc HJ is 122°, which is consistent with the central angle H-K-J being 122°, as expected.

But how does this help us find angle GLJ? Maybe there's more relationships here.

Alternatively, perhaps point L is positioned such that arc GLJ relates to other arcs. Let me try to consider possible positions of L.

Since GJ is a diameter, and L is a point on the circle, then depending on where L is, the measure of angle GLJ changes. However, without knowing the specific location of L, how can we compute the measure?

Wait, but perhaps there's more constraints. Let me check again the given constraints.

Wait, the problem includes the constraint that "IsCentroidOf(Point(K),Circle(K))". Wait, centroid usually refers to the center of mass, but in the context of a circle, the centroid is the same as the center. So, probably that's redundant, confirming that K is the center.

Another thing: There's an Arc(G,L,J). Maybe that's referring to arc from G to J passing through L. Which would imply that L is a point on the arc GJ. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ is 180°, so if L is on that arc, then arc GLJ would be the entire semicircle. But that seems trivial. Alternatively, maybe Arc(G,L,J) refers to an arc starting at G, going through L, ending at J. Which would be a major arc or minor arc depending on where L is.

However, the problem mentions MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) equals 122°, which is the arc from H to J, which we already established. Now, perhaps the position of point L is determined based on other constraints?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving point L. Let me check the initial constraints again.

Original constraints include:

- PointLiesOnCircle(G,Circle(K)): So G is on the circle.

- Similarly for H, J, L.

- Line(G,J) is a diameter.

- Lines KH, KG, KJ are radii.

- Arc(G,J): Not sure yet.

- Arc(G,L,J): Maybe arc from G to J passing through L. So, arc GLJ.

Additionally, the problem mentions that MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) equals 122°, which is given. So arc HJ is 122°, which is less than 180°, so that implies that H and J are not diametrically opposed. Since GJ is a diameter, so J is directly opposite G. Therefore, H is somewhere on the circle such that the arc from H to J is 122°, which would place H somewhere on the circle not aligned with GJ.

But how does this affect point L? Unless there's another constraint involving L. Wait, the problem didn't give direct info about L except that it's on the circle. So unless there's an implied relationship between L and other points.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to arc GLJ as a different arc. Suppose arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L. If that's the case, then the measure of arc GLJ would depend on where L is located. But without knowing where L is, we can't determine it. But the problem is asking for the measure of angle GLJ, which is dependent on the arc it intercepts.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a property we're missing here. Let me recall that when you have an inscribed angle, like angle GLJ, it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. So angle GLJ intercepts arc GJ, which is a semicircle, so 180°, making the angle 90°, regardless of where L is on the circle. Wait, but that's only true if L is not on the arc GJ. Wait, no—if L is on the arc GJ, then angle GLJ would intercept arc GJ. But if L is on the opposite arc, then the intercepted arc would be the other arc. Wait, but since GJ is a diameter, the circle is split into two semicircles. So, if L is on one semicircle, then the angle GLJ would intercept arc GJ, which is 180°, leading to angle GLJ being 90°. But if L is on the other semicircle, then the intercepted arc would be... Well, the angle at L would intercept the arc that's opposite, which would still be arc GJ. Wait, no. Wait, when you have an inscribed angle, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. Wait, actually, the intercepted arc is the arc that is cut off by the two sides of the angle. So, if the angle is at L, then the intercepted arc is the arc from G to J that doesn't contain L. 

But since GJ is a diameter, the circle is divided into two semicircles. If L is on the same semicircle as arc GJ (the one that's 180°), then the intercepted arc would be the other semicircle. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Suppose we have points G and J as endpoints of a diameter. If point L is on the circle, then the angle GLJ is formed by connecting points G-L-J. Depending on where L is, the intercepted arc will vary. 

If L is on the semicircle that is opposite to arc GJ (i.e., the semicircle that doesn't include the arc GJ), then the intercepted arc would be arc GJ (which is 180°), so the angle at L would be half that, 90°. But if L is on the same semicircle as arc GJ (meaning that the arc from G to J along the path that goes through L is the semicircle), then the intercepted arc would be the other arc. Wait, no. Let me recall that the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle. So, if you have angle at L, then the intercepted arc is the arc from G to J that doesn't pass through L. So, if L is on one side of the diameter, the intercepted arc is the semicircle GJ, hence 180°, giving angle 90°. If L is on the other side, the intercepted arc would still be the same semicircle, because the arc from G to J that doesn't pass through L is still the semicircle. Wait, but if L is on the semicircle that contains arc GJ, then the arc from G to J not containing L would be the other semicircle. Wait, no. If L is on the semicircle from G to J, then the arc from G to J that doesn't contain L would be the other semicircle. But that's impossible because the arc from G to J is fixed as 180°, regardless of where L is. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of angle GLJ depends on the arc that is opposite to it. Let me think of an example. Suppose L is on the upper semicircle (assuming GJ is horizontal). Then, angle GLJ would intercept the lower semicircle (arc GJ), which is 180°, so angle GLJ would be 90°. If L were on the lower semicircle, then angle GLJ would intercept the upper semicircle, which is also 180°, leading to the same 90°. Hence, regardless of where L is on the circle, angle GLJ would always be 90°. Therefore, the answer would be 90°, which is option A.

But wait, this contradicts the presence of other information about arc HJ being 122°. Why is that given? Does that affect the position of L? Or is there something wrong with my reasoning?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the position of L is determined by the arc HJ being 122°, and that affects the angle GLJ somehow. Let me think again.

Given that arc HJ is 122°, which is a portion of the circle. Since H is another point on the circle, and we have points G, J as endpoints of a diameter. So, the circle has total 360°, so arc HJ is 122°, and arc HJ could be part of the circle. But how does that relate to point L?

Unless point L is defined in relation to H and J. Wait, the problem mentions Arc(G,L,J), which could be interpreted as arc from G to J passing through L. If that's the case, then the measure of arc GLJ would be the sum of arc GL plus arc LJ. But without knowing where L is, we cannot determine that. However, the problem may have more clues.

Wait, the problem also includes the equality of MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(H,K,J)), which is 122°, as given. And the MeasureOf(Arc(H,J)) is 122°, which we've already used. 

Maybe there's a way to find the position of L using other constraints. For instance, since K is the center, and we have various radii. But I don't see a direct link between point L and the other points unless there's more info.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves cyclic quadrilaterals or something similar. But I'm not seeing it yet.

Wait, but if angle GLJ is always 90°, regardless of where L is, then why is the arc HJ given? Maybe there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. Let me verify.

Let me take a concrete example. Let’s assume the circle has center K, and GJ is a diameter. Let’s suppose coordinates: Let’s set coordinate system with K at origin (0,0), G at (-1,0), J at (1,0). Then any point L on the circle can be represented as (cosθ, sinθ).

Now, angle GLJ is the angle at point L between points G, L, J. Let me calculate that angle.

Using coordinates: Let’s pick a point L on the circle. For example, take L at (0,1). Then, vectors LG and LJ are from L to G and L to J.

Vector LG = G - L = (-1 - 0, 0 - 1) = (-1, -1)

Vector LJ = J - L = (1 - 0, 0 - 1) = (1, -1)

The angle between vectors LG and LJ can be found via dot product:

cos(angle) = (LG • LJ)/(|LG| |LJ|)

Compute LG • LJ = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 + 1 = 0

So cos(angle) = 0 → angle is 90°. So in this case, angle GLJ is 90°.

Another example: Take L at (1/√2, 1/√2). Then vector LG is (-1 - 1/√2, 0 - 1/√2) = (-1 - 1/√2, -1/√2)

Vector LJ is (1 - 1/√2, 0 - 1/√2) = (1 - 1/√2, -1/√2)

Calculating their dot product:

[(-1 - 1/√2)(1 - 1/√2)] + [(-1/√2)(-1/√2)]

First term: (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1/√2) + (-1/√2)(1) + (-1/√2)(-1/√2)

Wait, expanding the first part:

Multiply (-1 - 1/√2)(1 - 1/√2):

= (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1/√2) + (-1/√2)(1) + (-1/√2)(-1/√2)

= -1 + 1/√2 - 1/√2 + (1/2)

= -1 + 0 + 1/2 = -1/2

Second term: [(-1/√2)(-1/√2)] = 1/2

Total dot product: -1/2 + 1/2 = 0

Again, angle is 90°. So regardless of where L is on the circle, angle GLJ is 90°, because the vectors LG and LJ are perpendicular. Thus, the measure of angle GLJ is always 90°, so the answer is A.

Therefore, even though there's information about arc HJ being 122°, it doesn't affect the measure of angle GLJ, which remains 90°. So the correct answer is A.

But let me double-check if there's a scenario where angle GLJ isn't 90°. Suppose L coincides with H. Wait, but then points G, H, J would be on the circle. But if L is H, then angle GLJ becomes angle GHJ. However, since H is on the circle, and GJ is a diameter, then angle GHJ would be an inscribed angle subtending arc GJ, which is 180°, so angle GHJ would be 90°, same as before. So even in that case, it's 90°. Therefore, regardless of where L is, angle GLJ is 90°. Therefore, answer A is correct.

Thus, despite the given arc HJ being 122°, that doesn't influence angle GLJ, which is always a right angle. Therefore, Final Answer: A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle GLJ $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Key Geometric Constraints**
1. **Circle(K)**: A circle centered at point **K**.
2. **Points G, H, J, L**: All lie on the circumference of the circle.
3. **Line(G, J)**: This is a **diameter** of the circle, implying that **K** lies at the midpoint of segment **GJ**.
4. **Angle(H, K, J)**: Given as $ 122^\circ $, which corresponds to a **central angle**, indicating that **arc(HJ)** measures $ 122^\circ $.
5. **Point L** lies on the circle, and the measure of **arc(H, J)** is equal to the measure of $ \angle(H, K, J) $, confirming that **arc(HJ) = 122°**.

---

### **Understanding the Angle $ \angle GLJ $**

We are asked to find the measure of $ \angle GLJ $, i.e., the angle formed at point **L** by the intersection of segments **LG** and **LJ**.

#### **Step 1: Use Inscribed Angle Theorem**
An important theorem in circle geometry states that an **inscribed angle** whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides intersect the circle at two other points intercepts an arc. The measure of the inscribed angle is **half the measure of the intercepted arc**.

Here, $ \angle GLJ $ is an **inscribed angle** because:
- Its vertex is at point **L**, which lies on the circle.
- Its arms extend to **G** and **J**, both of which are also on the circle.

Thus, $ \angle GLJ $ intercepts **arc GJ**.

#### **Step 2: Determine the Measure of Intercepted Arc**
From the given, **GJ** is a **diameter**, which divides the circle into two **semicircles**. Each semicircle spans **180°**.

So,
$$
\text{Arc}(GJ) = 180^\circ
$$

#### **Step 3: Compute the Inscribed Angle**
By the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
$$
m\angle GLJ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m(\text{Arc}(GJ)) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 180^\circ = 90^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Regardless of the position of point **L** on the circle, the measure of $ \angle GLJ $ is always **$ 90^\circ $** because it always intercepts the **semicircular arc GJ**, which is $ 180^\circ $. Other details, such as the measure of arc **HJ** ($ 122^\circ $), are extraneous to this particular computation.
