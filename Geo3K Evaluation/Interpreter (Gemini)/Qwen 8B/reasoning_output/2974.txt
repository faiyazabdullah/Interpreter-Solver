MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral PQRS that's a rhombus inscribed in a circle. The question is asking for the measure of arc SP, which I think is denoted as m∠SP or maybe the arc length? Wait, no, the notation m∠SP might refer to the measure of the arc SP. But actually, since it's talking about arc SP, probably they mean the arc between points S and P on the circle. Let me make sure.

First, let's recall some properties. If a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, it's called a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of each pair of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. However, here we're told that it's a rhombus. A rhombus has all sides equal, and opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles and are perpendicular. 

But here's the key point: if a rhombus is inscribed in a circle, then it must satisfy the conditions of being both a rhombus and cyclic. Now, I remember that a parallelogram can be cyclic only if it's a rectangle because in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so for them to be supplementary (as needed for cyclic quadrilaterals), each angle must be 90 degrees. Therefore, the only parallelograms that are cyclic are rectangles. But a rhombus is a type of parallelogram. So combining these two, if a rhombus is cyclic, it must be a square. Because a square is both a rhombus and a rectangle. Therefore, PQRS must be a square. 

Wait, but the problem says it's a rhombus. However, the given information also includes that all four vertices lie on the circle. So that would imply that it's a square. Then, if it's a square, all arcs between consecutive points should be equal. Since a circle is 360 degrees, each arc between two adjacent vertices would be 360/4 = 90 degrees. But the question asks for m∠SP, which is the measure of arc SP. Wait, in a square, moving from S to P would be going around the circle. Let me visualize the square inscribed in a circle. The order of the points is P, Q, R, S. So if you go from S to P, that's one side of the square. Wait, but in terms of arcs, the arc SP would depend on how the points are arranged.

Let me clarify the positions. In a square inscribed in a circle, the arcs between each consecutive vertex are equal. So each arc is 90 degrees. But if the question is asking for arc SP, depending on direction. For example, if the square is labeled in order P-Q-R-S-P, then the arc from S to P would be the same as the arc from P to Q, etc., but since it's a circle, the arc SP could be considered as either the minor arc or major arc. However, since it's a square, the arcs between consecutive points are each 90 degrees. So the arc SP would be the same as the arc PQ, QR, RS, etc., each 90 degrees. Wait, but if you take the arc from S to P, that would be three sides away? Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the square is inscribed in a circle, then the points are placed every 90 degrees. Suppose starting at point P, moving counterclockwise, the next point is Q, then R, then S, then back to P. So the arc from P to Q is 90 degrees, Q to R another 90, R to S another 90, and S back to P another 90. Therefore, the arc SP would be the arc from S to P, which is the same as the arc from S to P going the short way around the circle. That would be the same as the arc from S to P through the other points. Wait, but if you start at S and go clockwise to P, that's the same as the arc from S to P passing through R and Q? No, wait. If the square is labeled in order P, Q, R, S, then moving clockwise around the circle, the order is P, Q, R, S, P. So the arc from S to P would be the arc that goes from S to P directly, which is one edge of the square. Wait, but in that case, the arc SP would be the same as arc PQ, which is 90 degrees. But the problem mentions Arc(SP) and Arc(PQ) are congruent. Wait, according to the given constraints, Congruent(Arc(S,P),Arc(P,Q)), so their measures are equal. Which makes sense if they are both 90 degrees. 

But the problem is asking for m∠SP. Wait, maybe there's confusion between angle and arc measure. Wait, the original question says "Find m ∠SP". Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote "m ∠SP", but perhaps that was intended to be arc SP. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the measure of the arc SP. Because angles inside circles relate to arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and they meant arc SP. Because the problem lists several arcs like Arc(S,P), Arc(P,Q), etc., and states that those arcs are congruent. So if all arcs are congruent, each arc is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc SP would be 90 degrees, making the answer D. But let's check again.

However, the problem says that the quadrilateral is a rhombus, not necessarily a square. Wait, earlier reasoning suggested that if a rhombus is cyclic, then it must be a square. Because in a cyclic parallelogram, it's a rectangle. And since a rhombus is a parallelogram, if it's cyclic, it's a square. Therefore, the rhombus must be a square. Hence, each arc between consecutive points is 90 degrees, so arc SP would be 90 degrees, hence answer D. But let me double-check that logic.

Another approach: suppose the rhombus is cyclic. All sides are equal. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides. Wait, but for a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me denote the sides as AB=BC=CD=DA=a. For a cyclic quadrilateral, the formula for the product of the diagonals is AC * BD = ab + cd, but since all sides are equal, it becomes AC * BD = 2a². But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy AC² + BD² = 4a². Wait, but if it's cyclic, then the formula for cyclic quadrilaterals gives us that AC * BD = 2a². Let me see if that holds.

But in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2. Also, since it's cyclic, the area can be expressed as ab sin θ, where θ is one of the angles. Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so area is a² sin θ. But if it's cyclic, then θ must be 90 degrees, because in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so if they are supplementary, each angle must be 90 degrees. Hence, the rhombus is a square. Therefore, confirming that the shape is indeed a square. Thus, each arc between consecutive vertices is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc SP would be 90 degrees. So the answer is D. But looking at the answer choices, D is 90. 

But wait, the problem says "arc SP" — if the points are ordered such that the arc SP is one of the sides, then yes, it's 90 degrees. However, sometimes arcs can be major or minor. But since the quadrilateral is convex and inscribed in the circle, the arcs between consecutive vertices are the minor arcs. So arc SP would be the minor arc, which is 90 degrees. Therefore, answer D. 

But let me check again if there's a different interpretation. Suppose the question is asking for the measure of angle SP, meaning the angle at point S between points P and something else? Wait, no. The notation m∠SP is unclear. But given the context, and the fact that the problem includes Arc(S,P), which is likely referring to the arc between S and P, then the measure of that arc would be 90 degrees. Hence, answer D. 

But wait, the problem also mentions that all arcs are congruent. For instance, Congruent(Arc(S,P),Arc(P,Q)), etc. So each arc is equal, implying that each arc is 90 degrees. So arc SP is 90 degrees, answer D. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
