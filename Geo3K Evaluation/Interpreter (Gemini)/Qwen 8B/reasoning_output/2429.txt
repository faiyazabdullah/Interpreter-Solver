MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of the parallelogram based on the given constraints. First, I need to recall that the area of a parallelogram can be calculated as base times height. But since there are some angles involved here, maybe using trigonometry would help. Let me go through the information step by step.

The problem mentions a parallelogram ABCD. So opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, points E are mentioned with lines BE and ED. There are several conditions given:

- AB and CD are sides of the parallelogram, so they should be equal in length. Wait, but it says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)), 14). CB is one side? Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and BC equals AD. Wait, but the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)), 14) which is BC = 14. Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(C,B))) implies AD equals BC, so AD is also 14. Therefore, both pairs of opposite sides are 14 units each. 

Also, Angle(A,D,C) is given as 60 degrees. That angle is at point D between points A, D, and C. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but angle ADC is 60°, so the adjacent angle at D (if considering angle ADC) might be part of the parallelogram. However, since in a parallelogram consecutive angles are supplementary, but angle ADC and angle DAB would be supplementary. Hmm.

But more importantly, the area formula for a parallelogram can also be expressed as ab sin(theta), where a and b are the lengths of the sides and theta is the angle between them. Here, if we take sides AD and DC, but wait, AD and DC are adjacent sides? Wait, no. In a parallelogram, adjacent sides meet at a vertex. For example, at point D, the sides DA and DC meet. So angle ADC is between DA and DC. Wait, but DA and DC are two adjacent sides. So the angle between DA and DC is 60 degrees. Therefore, the area would be |DA| * |DC| * sin(angle between them). Wait, but DA and DC are adjacent sides?

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify the structure of the parallelogram. The vertices are A, B, C, D. In a parallelogram, the order matters. So if it's ABCD, then AB is connected to BC, CD, DA. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors AD and BC are equal.

So angle ADC is the angle at D between AD and DC. So angle between AD and DC is 60 degrees. Therefore, if AD and DC are two adjacent sides of the parallelogram, their lengths would be... Well, we know that BC is 14, so AD is also 14 because in a parallelogram opposite sides are equal. What about DC? DC is equal to AB. Wait, but do we know the length of DC?

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(C,B))). So AD equals CB, which is given as 14. So AD is 14. But DC is another side. Wait, but how long is DC?

Wait, perhaps DC is equal to AB. But do we have information about AB? Not directly. Unless there's something else. Alternatively, maybe triangle BCD or something else gives us info.

Wait, there's also information about point E. Let me check again.

There's a line BE, and angle BEA is a right angle. Also, there's a triangle BED. Also, several conditions involving perpendicularity and parallelism. Let me parse these:

- Parallel(Line(B,C), Line(A,D)): BC || AD. Which makes sense since in a parallelogram opposite sides are parallel.

- Perpendicular(Line(B,E), Line(A,D)): So BE is perpendicular to AD. So line BE is an altitude relative to AD? Because if it's perpendicular, then BE could be the height corresponding to base AD.

Additionally, the problem states IsAltitudeOf(Line(B,E), Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)). So BE is an altitude of the parallelogram. Therefore, the length of BE is the height corresponding to base AD.

Moreover, the problem states Equals(SinOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), LengthOf(Line(D,B)))). Let's note that.

First, angle ADC is 60 degrees. So sin(60°) equals (BE)/DB. Wait, DB is the length of line segment DB? Or is it BD?

Wait, Line(DB) would be from D to B. Wait, but in the parallelogram ABCD, diagonals bisect each other, but unless it's a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily equal. However, in this case, maybe we can find relations.

Alternatively, since BE is perpendicular to AD, and BE is the altitude, then the area of the parallelogram is base * height = AD * BE.

We already know that AD is 14. If we can find BE, then multiply by 14 to get the area.

Now, according to the equation given:

sin(60°) = (BE)/DB.

So BE = DB * sin(60°).

But what is DB? DB is the length of diagonal BD? Or is it another segment? Wait, Line(D,B) is DB, yes.

But how to find DB?

Alternatively, maybe we can use triangle BDE or something else.

Wait, there's a triangle BED. Points B, E, D form a triangle. And BE is one of its sides, ED is another. Given that ED has length 7. Because Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 7). So ED = 7.

Also, angle at E, angle BEA is a right angle. Wait, angle(B,E,A) is a right angle. So angle at E between points B, E, A is 90 degrees. So triangle BEA is a right triangle with right angle at E.

Hmm, but how does that relate to other parts?

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Let me sketch mentally:

Parallelogram ABCD. Let me assume coordinates for easier calculation. Maybe assign coordinates to points to model the problem.

Let me place point D at origin (0,0). Since AD is a side of the parallelogram, and AD has length 14. Let me suppose vector AD is along x-axis for simplicity. Wait, but angle at D is 60 degrees. Wait, angle ADC is 60 degrees. So angle between AD and DC is 60 degrees. So if AD is along x-axis from D(0,0) to A(14,0), then DC would make a 60-degree angle with AD. So direction of DC is 60 degrees above AD.

Therefore, coordinates:

Let me set D at (0,0).

AD is from D(0,0) to A(14,0). So AD is horizontal.

Then, angle ADC is 60 degrees. So DC starts at D(0,0) and goes at 60 degrees from AD. Since AD is along positive x-axis, DC would be going upwards at 60 degrees from D.

But in a parallelogram, DC should be equal to AB. Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector DC equals vector AB.

But maybe assigning coordinates will help.

Let me proceed:

Set D at (0,0). A is at (14,0).

Since angle ADC is 60 degrees, then vector DC makes 60 degrees with DC. Wait, DC is from D to C. So direction from D to C is 60 degrees above AD (which is along x-axis). Let me denote the length of DC as 'x'. Wait, but earlier, we had BC = 14. In a parallelogram, DC equals AB, and BC equals AD. Wait, AD is 14, so BC is also 14. Therefore, DC equals AB. Wait, but AB is another side. Wait, but AB is from A to B. How long is AB?

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals DC, and BC equals AD. Since BC is 14, then AD is also 14. Therefore, DC equals AB. But we don't know DC's length yet. However, perhaps we can find it via other constraints.

But there's also the triangle BED. Let me think about point E.

Given that BE is perpendicular to AD, and AD is along x-axis from (0,0) to (14,0). So BE is vertical? Wait, if AD is horizontal, then a line perpendicular to AD would be vertical. Therefore, BE is vertical. So if BE is perpendicular to AD, then BE is vertical. So point E lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through B? Wait, no. Wait, BE is a line that is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, BE is vertical. Therefore, BE is a vertical line. So the slope of BE is undefined (vertical line). So point E lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through B.

But where is point B? Let me try to determine coordinates of B.

In the parallelogram ABCD, since AD is from D(0,0) to A(14,0). Vector AD is (14,0). Now, vector DC is such that angle ADC is 60 degrees. Let me compute coordinates of C.

Vector DC has magnitude equal to AB, which we don't know yet. But since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. So vector AB = DC.

Coordinates of B can be determined once we know vector DC.

Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the coordinates can be defined as follows:

If D is (0,0), A is (a,0), then since angle at D is 60 degrees, and DC has length say 'b', then coordinates of C would be (b*cos(θ), b*sin(θ)), where θ is 60 degrees. Wait, but θ is the angle between AD and DC, which is 60 degrees. So yes.

So assuming AD is along x-axis from D(0,0) to A(a,0). Then DC is making 60 degrees with AD. So if DC has length 'b', then coordinates of C would be (b*cos(60°), b*sin(60°)) = (b*(1/2), b*(√3/2)).

But in a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is from A(a,0) to B(x,y). Vector DC is from D(0,0) to C(b/2, (b√3)/2). So AB = DC => coordinates of B = A + DC. So if A is at (a,0), then B would be at (a + b/2, 0 + (b√3)/2).

But since ABCD is a parallelogram, coordinates of B can also be determined via vector addition. Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, the coordinates of B can be found as A + DC. Wait, maybe better to use coordinates step by step.

Alternatively, since in the parallelogram, the coordinates of C can be found as A + vector DC. Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let me assign variables properly.

Let me fix D at (0,0), A at (14,0). Then, since angle ADC is 60 degrees, and DC is of length 'b' (same as AB). Coordinates of C would be (b cos 60°, b sin 60°) = (b*(1/2), b*(√3/2)).

Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector DC is from D(0,0) to C(b/2, (b√3)/2). So vector DC is (b/2, (b√3)/2). Therefore, vector AB is same as DC, so starting from A(14,0), adding vector DC gives coordinates of B as (14 + b/2, 0 + (b√3)/2). So B is at (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2).

Now, coordinates of B are known in terms of b.

Now, we have point E such that line BE is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, BE is vertical. Therefore, line BE is vertical. So the x-coordinate of B and E must be the same. Because a vertical line has constant x-coordinate. Therefore, point E lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through B. So E has coordinates (xB, yE), where xB is the x-coordinate of B, which is 14 + b/2.

Also, given that triangle BED exists, and ED has length 7. Point E is connected to D(0,0) and B. So ED is from E to D(0,0), and its length is 7. Let me write coordinates for E as (xB, yE) = (14 + b/2, yE). Then distance from E to D(0,0) is sqrt[(14 + b/2 - 0)^2 + (yE - 0)^2] = 7. So:

sqrt[ (14 + b/2)^2 + yE^2 ] = 7 → square both sides:

(14 + b/2)^2 + yE² = 49. Equation (1)

Also, angle at E, angle BEA is a right angle. So angle at E between points B, E, A is 90 degrees. So triangle BEA is right-angled at E. Therefore, vectors EB and EA are perpendicular.

Point E is (xB, yE) = (14 + b/2, yE). Point B is (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2). Point A is (14, 0).

Vector EB is from E to B: (14 + b/2 - (14 + b/2), (b√3)/2 - yE ) = (0, (b√3)/2 - yE )

Vector EA is from E to A: (14 - (14 + b/2), 0 - yE ) = (-b/2, -yE )

For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:

EB • EA = 0 * (-b/2) + [(b√3)/2 - yE] * (-yE) = 0

Which simplifies to:

- yE * [(b√3)/2 - yE] = 0

Thus, either yE = 0 or (b√3)/2 - yE = 0.

Case 1: yE = 0. Then point E would be on the x-axis. But then ED would be the distance from E to D(0,0). If E is on x-axis, then yE=0, so E is (14 + b/2, 0). Then ED distance would be |14 + b/2 - 0| = |14 + b/2|. But ED is given as 7. So 14 + b/2 = ±7. But since lengths are positive, 14 + b/2 = 7 → b/2 = -7 → b = -14, which is impossible since lengths are positive. Hence, invalid. So Case 1 rejected.

Case 2: (b√3)/2 - yE = 0 ⇒ yE = (b√3)/2. So substituting back into Equation (1):

(14 + b/2)^2 + [ (b√3)/2 ]^2 = 49

Compute this expression:

Expand (14 + b/2)^2 = 14² + 2*14*(b/2) + (b/2)^2 = 196 + 14b + b²/4

And [ (b√3)/2 ]^2 = (3b²)/4

Adding together:

196 + 14b + b²/4 + 3b²/4 = 196 + 14b + (b²/4 + 3b²/4) = 196 + 14b + b² = 49

Thus:

b² + 14b + 196 = 49 ⇒ b² + 14b + 147 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

Discriminant D = 14² - 4*1*147 = 196 - 588 = -392 < 0. No real solutions. Contradiction. What did I do wrong here?

Wait, this suggests that my assumption leads to no solution. So there must be an error in reasoning. Let me retrace steps.

Earlier, when calculating vectors EB and EA, I considered vectors from E to B and E to A. Wait, but the angle at E is between BE and EA, meaning vectors EB and EA emanate from E. Wait, angle BEA is the angle at E between points B-E-A, so vectors EB and EA start at E. Wait, but in the previous calculation, I took vectors from E to B and E to A. Yes, those are correct.

But solving gave me no real solution. Which means something's wrong. Perhaps my coordinate setup is incorrect?

Wait, maybe I made an error in setting up the coordinates. Let me double-check.

I assumed that AD is along x-axis from D(0,0) to A(14,0). Then, vector DC makes 60 degrees with AD, hence coordinates of C would be (b*cos(60°), b*sin(60°))? Wait, but DC is from D(0,0) to C. If angle at D between AD and DC is 60 degrees, then the direction of DC is 60 degrees from AD. So yes, if AD is along positive x-axis, then DC is at 60 degrees above x-axis. Thus, coordinates of C are (b*cos(60°), b*sin(60°)) = (b*(1/2), b*(√3/2)).

Then vector DC is (b/2, (b√3)/2). So vector AB equals vector DC. Since AB is from A(14,0) to B, then coordinates of B = A + vector DC. So B_x = 14 + b/2, B_y = 0 + (b√3)/2. Correct.

Then, line BE is vertical, so E has same x-coordinate as B. So E is (14 + b/2, y_E). Distance from E to D(0,0) is 7. So squared distance is (14 + b/2)^2 + y_E^2 = 49. Correct.

Then angle at E between B-E-A is 90 degrees, leading to vectors EB and EA being perpendicular. Wait, but in that case, vectors EB and EA are from E to B and E to A. Wait, but the angle at E is between BE and AE, so vectors EB and EA. So the dot product of EB and EA should be zero.

Vector EB is B - E = (14 + b/2 - (14 + b/2), (b√3)/2 - y_E) = (0, (b√3)/2 - y_E)

Vector EA is A - E = (14 - (14 + b/2), 0 - y_E) = (-b/2, -y_E)

Dot product is (0)(-b/2) + [(b√3)/2 - y_E](-y_E) = -y_E[(b√3)/2 - y_E] = 0.

Thus, either y_E = 0 (invalid) or y_E = (b√3)/2. Substituting back into the distance equation gives:

(14 + b/2)^2 + [(b√3)/2]^2 = 49. Which expands to:

(196 + 14b + b²/4) + (3b²)/4 = 196 + 14b + b² = 49 → b² + 14b + 147 = 0. Which has discriminant 196 - 588 = negative. Impossible.

This suggests inconsistency, implying that my assumptions are wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the angle is not between vectors EB and EA, but between BE and EA. Wait, but angle at E between B-E-A would mean that BE and EA are the two segments forming the angle. So vectors from E to B and from E to A. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that if angle is 90 degrees, then the dot product of EB and EA is zero. But that led to no solution.

Alternative possibility: Did I mix up vectors? Suppose instead, vectors EB and EA are from E to B and E to A. Wait, but that's what I did. Or perhaps I should consider vectors from B to E and from A to E? No, because angle at E is between BE and AE.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the coordinates of point C. Let me think again about the parallelogram.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the sum of vectors AB + AD = AC. But maybe I need to ensure that the coordinates are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I assigned the angle incorrectly. The angle ADC is at D, between points A-D-C. So angle between DA and DC. DA is from D to A, which is towards the right along x-axis. DC is from D to C, which is at 60 degrees from DA. So that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the length of DC isn't b, but we need to find it. Wait, but earlier, we thought that DC equals AB. But since BC is 14, which is equal to AD, which is 14. Wait, in a parallelogram, BC equals AD, which is 14. So BC is 14, AD is 14. Then AB equals DC. But AB is unknown. So DC = AB. So if I call AB = DC = x, then x is unknown. But how?

But then, in the equations above, I used b for DC's length. So in the previous equations, b was DC's length. But then the resulting equation had no solution. This suggests that my approach may be missing something.

Wait, but there's another condition given: Equals(SinOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), LengthOf(Line(D,B)))).

That is, sin(60°) = BE / DB.

So sin(60°) = BE / DB → BE = DB * sin(60°).

So if I can express BE and DB in terms of b, then maybe I can find b.

From earlier, BE is the length of BE. Since BE is vertical, from point B(14 + b/2, (b√3)/2) to point E(14 + b/2, y_E). So BE length is |(b√3)/2 - y_E|. Earlier, we had from the perpendicularity condition that y_E = (b√3)/2. Wait, but that led to contradiction. However, if that's true, then BE length is zero, which can't be. So there must be an error here.

Wait, earlier conclusion from the perpendicularity condition was that y_E = (b√3)/2. But then point E would be at (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2), which is same as point B. But then ED would be distance from E=B to D(0,0), which would be sqrt((14 + b/2)^2 + ((b√3)/2)^2) = sqrt( (14 + b/2)^2 + 3b²/4 ). But this is supposed to be 7. Which brings us back to the same equation leading to no solution. So contradiction.

This suggests that there is an error in the setup. Let me reconsider the entire approach.

Perhaps the issue is in the assumption of placing AD along x-axis. Maybe I should instead use different coordinates or consider that BE is not vertical? Wait, no, since BE is perpendicular to AD, which is horizontal, so BE must be vertical. So that part seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe angle BEA is not the angle between BE and EA, but between BE and some other segment? Wait, the problem says Angle(B,E,A), which is angle at E between points B-E-A, so it's indeed between BE and EA.

Another idea: Perhaps my assumption that DC has length b is conflicting with other constraints. Let me think about the triangle BED. We have ED = 7, BE is some value, and BD is the diagonal from B to D. Let me try to express BD in terms of b.

Point B is at (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2), and point D is at (0,0). So BD length is sqrt[(14 + b/2)^2 + ((b√3)/2)^2]. Let me calculate this:

BD² = (14 + b/2)^2 + ( (b√3)/2 )^2 = 196 + 14b + b²/4 + 3b²/4 = 196 + 14b + b².

So BD = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196).

From earlier, we have BE = DB * sin(60°). Also, BE is the length from B to E, which we previously tried to calculate as |(b√3)/2 - y_E|. But from the perpendicularity condition, we derived that y_E = (b√3)/2, making BE = 0, which is impossible. So this suggests that there is a miscalculation.

Wait, but maybe the equation from the sine ratio is different. Let me revisit that.

The problem states: Equals(SinOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), LengthOf(Line(D,B))))

So sin(60°) = BE / DB → BE = DB * sin(60°).

But from our earlier analysis, if BE = DB * sin(60°), and we have BD = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196), then BE = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196) * (√3/2).

But also, BE is the length from B to E. Earlier, we thought that BE is vertical, so BE = |y_B - y_E|. Since y_B is (b√3)/2, and if BE is vertical, then y_E = y_B ± something. Wait, but earlier, we derived from the perpendicularity condition that y_E = (b√3)/2, but that caused issues. Maybe there's a miscalculation there.

Wait, let's re-examine the perpendicularity condition. We said that vectors EB and EA are perpendicular. So if E is at (xB, y_E), then vector EB is (0, y_B - y_E), and vector EA is (-b/2, -y_E). Their dot product is 0*(-b/2) + (y_B - y_E)*(-y_E) = -y_E(y_B - y_E) = 0.

So either y_E = 0 (invalid) or y_B = y_E. So y_E = y_B = (b√3)/2. Then, point E is at (xB, y_B), which is the same as point B. But then ED is the distance from E=B to D, which is BD, and we're told ED = 7. So BD = 7. But BD is sqrt(b² + 14b + 196) = 7. Squaring both sides: b² + 14b + 196 = 49 → b² + 14b + 147 = 0, which as before has no real roots. So this is impossible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. Let me think differently.

Maybe the angle at E is not between BE and EA, but between BE and some other segment? Or perhaps I misapplied the perpendicularity condition?

Wait, the problem states: RightAngle(Angle(B,E,A)), so angle at E between B-E-A is right angle. So triangle BEA is right-angled at E. So BE is one leg, EA is another leg, and BA is hypotenuse. But in that case, BE² + EA² = BA².

Let me try to calculate BE and EA.

From earlier, E is at (xB, y_E). So BE is the length from E to B, which is sqrt[(xB - xB)^2 + (y_B - y_E)^2] = |y_B - y_E|.

EA is the length from E to A: sqrt[(xA - xE)^2 + (y_A - y_E)^2]. xA is 14, xE is xB = 14 + b/2. So xA - xE = 14 - (14 + b/2) = -b/2. y_A is 0, so EA = sqrt[ (-b/2)^2 + (0 - y_E)^2 ] = sqrt( b²/4 + y_E² ).

BA is the length from B to A: sqrt[(14 - xB)^2 + (0 - y_B)^2]. xB is 14 + b/2, so 14 - xB = -b/2. y_B is (b√3)/2. So BA = sqrt[ (b/2)^2 + ( (b√3)/2 )^2 ] = sqrt[ b²/4 + 3b²/4 ] = sqrt[b²] = |b|. Since length is positive, BA = b.

So by Pythagoras: BE² + EA² = BA².

Substitute BE = |y_B - y_E| = |(b√3)/2 - y_E|, and EA = sqrt(b²/4 + y_E²), and BA = b.

So:

[(b√3/2 - y_E)^2] + [b²/4 + y_E²] = b².

Expanding first term: (b√3/2 - y_E)^2 = (3b²/4) - b√3 y_E + y_E².

Adding second term: 3b²/4 - b√3 y_E + y_E² + b²/4 + y_E² = (3b²/4 + b²/4) + (-b√3 y_E) + (y_E² + y_E²) = b² - b√3 y_E + 2y_E².

Setting equal to b²:

b² - b√3 y_E + 2y_E² = b² → -b√3 y_E + 2y_E² = 0 → y_E(-b√3 + 2y_E) = 0.

So either y_E = 0 or 2y_E = b√3 → y_E = (b√3)/2.

Again, same results as before. So y_E = 0 or y_E = (b√3)/2. As before, y_E = 0 leads to no solution. So y_E = (b√3)/2. Then, point E is at (xB, y_B) = (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2), same as point B. So ED is distance from E=B to D, which is BD = 7. So BD = 7. But BD² = b² + 14b + 196 = 49. Which leads to b² + 14b + 147 = 0, which has no real root. So contradiction.

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given constraints, or perhaps my coordinate system is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that the parallelogram exists, so there must be a solution. Perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the angle ADC?

Wait, angle ADC is at D, between A-D-C. In the parallelogram, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC. But if angle ADC is 60 degrees, then angle ABC is also 60 degrees. But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, so angle ADC + angle DAB = 180 degrees. So angle DAB = 120 degrees.

But how does this affect things?

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a rhombus? Since AD = BC = 14, and if AB = DC, but we don't know their lengths. Wait, but if it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. But the problem doesn't state that. It only says that AD = BC = 14, and that AD = BC.

Wait, but from the given, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(C,B))), which is AD = CB, which is 14. So AD and CB are 14. Other sides AB and DC are equal but not specified yet.

But perhaps there's another way to use the given equation: sin(60°) = BE / DB.

We have BE = DB * sin(60°). From earlier, BD = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196). And BE is the length from B to E, which we found to be zero if y_E = (b√3)/2. But this leads to contradiction. However, if we ignore that, and just take BE = DB * sin(60°), and also from triangle BEA, we have BE² + EA² = BA².

But if BE = DB * sin(60°), and BA = b, then:

BE = DB * √3/2.

But also, from triangle BEA, BE² + EA² = b².

But EA is the distance from E to A, which is sqrt( (b/2)^2 + y_E^2 ), and y_E = ?

Wait, but we have from the perpendicularity condition that y_E = (b√3)/2. Wait, but if that's the case, then EA = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + ( (b√3)/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( b²/4 + 3b²/4 ) = sqrt(b²) = b. So EA = b.

Then BE is zero? No, because if y_E = y_B, then BE is zero. So this suggests that BE = 0, which is impossible. So this indicates that there's a contradiction, suggesting that my initial assumptions about the position of point E are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the line BE is not vertical? But it should be perpendicular to AD, which is horizontal, so it should be vertical. So why is there a contradiction?

Maybe the issue is that point E is not on the vertical line through B? Wait, but BE is perpendicular to AD, so it must be vertical. So if AD is horizontal, BE is vertical. So E must lie on the vertical line through B. Hence, x-coordinate of E is same as B.

But this leads to contradictions. Maybe there's a miscalculation in the BD expression?

Wait, BD is the distance from B to D. With B at (14 + b/2, (b√3)/2) and D at (0,0), then BD² is (14 + b/2)^2 + ( (b√3)/2 )^2. Expand this:

= (14)^2 + 14*b + (b²)/4 + (3b²)/4

= 196 + 14b + b².

Yes, correct.

So BD = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196).

Now, from the given equation: sin(60°) = BE / BD.

But BE is the length from B to E. If we assume that BE = DB * sin(60°), then BE = sqrt(b² + 14b + 196) * (√3/2).

But from the right triangle BEA, we also have BE² + EA² = BA². Let's substitute BE and EA.

EA is the distance from E to A. If E is on the vertical line through B, then E is (xB, y_E), and A is (14, 0). So EA² = (xB - 14)^2 + (y_E - 0)^2 = (b/2)^2 + y_E^2.

BA is the distance from B to A, which is sqrt[(14 + b/2 - 14)^2 + ((b√3)/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(b/2)^2 + (b√3/2)^2] = sqrt(b²/4 + 3b²/4) = sqrt(b²) = b.

So BE² + EA² = [ (sqrt(b² + 14b + 196) * √3/2 )^2 ] + [ (b/2)^2 + y_E^2 ] = [ (b² + 14b + 196)*(3/4) ] + [ b²/4 + y_E^2 ] = (3b² + 42b + 588)/4 + b²/4 + y_E^2 = (4b² + 42b + 588)/4 + y_E^2 = b² + 10.5b + 147 + y_E^2.

But this should equal BA² = b². So:

b² + 10.5b + 147 + y_E^2 = b² → 10.5b + 147 + y_E^2 = 0.

This is impossible since all terms are positive. Hence, contradiction. This suggests that there is no solution under current assumptions, which cannot be true since the problem provides answer choices.

This implies that my coordinate setup is flawed. Let me try a different approach without coordinates.

Let me recall that in a parallelogram, area = base × height. We know AD = 14, and if we can find the height corresponding to base AD, then area is 14 × height.

The height can be found using the sine of the angle between the sides. Since angle ADC is 60 degrees, and AD and DC are adjacent sides, the height h corresponding to base AD would be DC × sin(60°). But DC is equal to AB, which is unknown. Wait, but in a parallelogram, area is also AB × AD × sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. Wait, but here, angle at D is 60 degrees, so if AD and DC are the sides, then the height is DC × sin(60°). So area = AD × DC × sin(60°).

But we need to find DC. How?

From the given, there is a relationship involving BE, which is an altitude. Since BE is perpendicular to AD, and it is an altitude of the parallelogram, so BE is the height. So area = AD × BE = 14 × BE.

Also, from the given equation: sin(60°) = BE / DB, where DB is the length of diagonal BD.

So BE = DB × sin(60°). So if we can find DB, we can find BE, and thus the area.

Now, in a parallelogram, the length of diagonal BD can be found using the law of cosines: BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB × AD × cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. Wait, but in our case, the angle at D is 60 degrees, which is between AD and DC. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So the angle between AB and AD is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. Wait, let me confirm.

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle ADC is 60 degrees, then angle DAB is 120 degrees. So the angle between AD and AB is 120 degrees. So applying the law of cosines to diagonal BD:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB × AD × cos(angle BAD).

Wait, angle BAD is 120 degrees. So:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB × AD × cos(120°).

But AD = 14, so:

BD² = AB² + 14² - 2 AB × 14 × cos(120°).

Cos(120°) is -0.5, so:

BD² = AB² + 196 - 2 AB × 14 × (-0.5) = AB² + 196 + 14 AB.

So BD² = AB² + 14 AB + 196.

Now, from the earlier equation, BE = DB × sin(60°). And BE is the height, which is also equal to DC × sin(60°), since DC is the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle. Wait, DC is equal to AB. So DC = AB. Hence, BE = AB × sin(60°).

Thus, BE = AB × (√3/2).

But also, BE = DB × sin(60°). So:

AB × (√3/2) = DB × (√3/2) → AB = DB.

So AB = DB. But from above, BD² = AB² + 14 AB + 196. If AB = DB, then:

AB² = AB² + 14 AB + 196 → 0 = 14 AB + 196 → AB = -14. Which is impossible, as lengths are positive.

Contradiction again! What's wrong here?

Wait, this suggests that my assumption that BE = DC × sin(60°) is incorrect. Let me rethink.

In a parallelogram, the height corresponding to base AD is the distance between AD and BC. Since BE is an altitude, it should be this height. But BE is from point B to line AD, but in this case, BE is perpendicular to AD and connects to point E on AD? Or is E somewhere else?

Wait, the problem says IsAltitudeOf(Line(B,E), Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)). So line BE is an altitude of the parallelogram. An altitude of a parallelogram is a line segment from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side. But in this case, line BE is an altitude, so it should be perpendicular to AD and connect to AD. But in the problem, E is a point such that line BE is perpendicular to AD, but it's not clear if E is on AD or not. Wait, the problem says "IsAltitudeOf(Line(B,E), Parallelogram(A,B,C,D))", which means that BE is an altitude, so it should be perpendicular to AD and intersect AD at some point. But in the problem, it's stated that Line(B,E) is an altitude, so E must be on AD or extended AD?

Wait, but in the given, there is also Triangle(B,E,D). So points B, E, D form a triangle. So E is not on AD, because if it were, then DE would be part of AD, but ED is given as 7. Let me think.

If BE is an altitude, then it should be perpendicular to AD and extend from B to AD. So E would be the foot of the perpendicular from B to AD. In that case, E is on AD. Let me try this scenario.

Assume E is on AD. Then, BE is perpendicular to AD, so E is the foot of B onto AD. Then, ED is the segment from E to D, which is part of AD. Given that ED = 7, and AD = 14, then AE = AD - ED = 14 - 7 = 7. So AE = 7, ED = 7. So E is the midpoint of AD. Wait, but AD is 14, so mid-point would be at 7 units from A and D. But if E is the midpoint, then BE is the median and also the altitude, which would imply that the parallelogram is a rhombus, but not sure.

Wait, but if E is on AD, then triangle BED has sides BE, ED=7, and BD. Also, angle at E is right angle (since BE is perpendicular to AD). So triangle BED is right-angled at E. So by Pythagoras, BE² + ED² = BD².

Also, from the given equation: sin(60°) = BE / BD.

Let me denote BE = h (height), ED = 7, BD = diagonal.

So from the right triangle: h² + 7² = BD².

From the given: sin(60°) = h / BD → h = BD * sin(60°).

Substitute into the first equation:

(BD * sin(60°))^2 + 49 = BD² → BD² * (sin²(60°)) + 49 = BD² → 49 = BD² (1 - sin²(60°)) = BD² * cos²(60°).

So BD² = 49 / cos²(60°).

cos(60°) = 0.5, so cos²(60°) = 0.25. Hence, BD² = 49 / 0.25 = 196 → BD = 14.

Then, h = BD * sin(60°) = 14 * (√3/2) = 7√3.

Thus, the height h is 7√3. Then, area of the parallelogram is base × height = AD × h = 14 × 7√3 = 98√3 ≈ 98 * 1.732 ≈ 169.744, which rounds to 169.7. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 169.7.

Wait, this matches option C. But how did I arrive here? By assuming that E is on AD, making BED a right triangle with ED = 7, BE = h, and BD = 14. This resolves the previous contradictions. Why didn't this come up in the coordinate approach? Probably because I incorrectly assumed E was not on AD, but rather somewhere else, leading to contradictions. 

Let me verify this new approach.

If E is on AD, then BE is perpendicular to AD, and ED = 7. Since AD = 14, AE = 14 - 7 = 7. So E is the midpoint of AD. In this case, BE is the height of the parallelogram. Then, using the right triangle BED, with BE = h, ED = 7, BD = 14. Then, h = 7√3. Area = 14 * 7√3 = 98√3 ≈ 169.7, which is option C.

But why did the previous coordinate approach fail? Because I incorrectly placed E not on AD, but elsewhere, leading to contradictions. The key was realizing that E is on AD, making it possible.

Let me verify if this satisfies all constraints.

Given that E is on AD, and ED = 7, then AD = 14, so AE = 7. BE is perpendicular to AD, so BE is the height. The angle at E is right angle, so triangle BED is right-angled at E. The given equation sin(60°) = BE / BD becomes sin(60°) = (7√3)/14 = √3/2, which is correct. So this works.

Now, what about the other constraints?

- Line(B,E) is perpendicular to AD: Yes, since BE is the altitude.

- Triangle(B,E,D): Yes, with BE, ED, BD.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 7): Yes, ED = 7.

- Equals(SinOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), LengthOf(Line(D,B)))): Sin(60°) = BE / BD = (7√3)/14 = √3/2, which is correct.

- Also, since BE is the height, and AD is the base, the area is 14 * 7√3 = 98√3 ≈ 169.7.

Thus, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the **area of the parallelogram**, we begin by analyzing the given geometric relationships and leveraging the properties of parallelograms and triangles.

---

### Step 1: Understand Key Constraints

We are given a **parallelogram** $ABCD$, with:

- $\angle ADC = 60^\circ$
- $BC = 14$ and $AD = 14$ (since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal)
- $ED = 7$
- $\angle BEA = 90^\circ$
- $\overline{BE} \perp \overline{AD}$, meaning $\overline{BE}$ is the **altitude** from point $B$ to side $\overline{AD}$
- $\triangle BED$ is a right triangle, with $\angle BEA = 90^\circ$

These details suggest that $\overline{BE}$ is the **height** of the parallelogram with respect to base $\overline{AD}$, and that point $E$ lies **on segment $AD$**.

---

### Step 2: Use Trigonometric Relationship

It’s given that:

$$
\sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{\text{length of } BE}{\text{length of } BD}
$$

With $\angle ADC = 60^\circ$, we know:

$$
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{BE}{BD} \Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{BE}{BD}
$$

So:

$$
BE = BD \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle BED$

In the right triangle $\triangle BED$, with:

- $\angle BEA = 90^\circ$
- $ED = 7$
- $BE = h$ (height)
- $BD$ is the hypotenuse

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
BE^2 + ED^2 = BD^2
$$

Substitute $BE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} BD$ and $ED = 7$:

$$
\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} BD \right)^2 + 7^2 = BD^2 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{3}{4} BD^2 + 49 = BD^2 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{4} BD^2 = 49 \\
\Rightarrow BD^2 = 196 \Rightarrow BD = 14
$$

Now compute $BE$:

$$
BE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 14 = 7\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### Step 4: Compute the Area of the Parallelogram

The area of a parallelogram is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

Here, the base is $\overline{AD} = 14$, and the height is $BE = 7\sqrt{3}$. So:

$$
\text{Area} = 14 \times 7\sqrt{3} = 98\sqrt{3}
$$

Approximating $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$:

$$
98 \times 1.732 \approx 169.744
$$

Rounded to the nearest tenth:

$$
\boxed{169.7}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
