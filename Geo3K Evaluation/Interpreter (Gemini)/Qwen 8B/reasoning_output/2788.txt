====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines, angles, and some measures given. The goal is to find the measure of angle 1. Let me start by listing out all the information given.

First, there are points A, B, C, D, E. Then there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(B,D,E) and Triangle(A,C,E). Also, there are lines connecting various points: Line(B,D), Line(D,E), Line(B,E), Line(A,E), Line(C,E), and Line(A,C). 

Angles mentioned are Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3), which correspond to Angle(B,D,E), Angle(D,B,E), and Angle(A,C,E) respectively. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

- MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E), 75): So Angle(B,D,E) is 75 degrees. That's Angle 1? Wait, no. Let me check again. The problem says:

Angle(1) corresponds to Angle(B,D,E)? Or maybe they are labeled differently. Let me parse that part again.

The problem states:

Angle(1) is Angle(B,D,E), Angle(2) is Angle(D,B,E), and Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:

"Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)
MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E), 75)
MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E), 35)
MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E), 28)"

So, the first three angles (Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3)) are probably corresponding to those three angles. But how?

Wait, perhaps:

- Angle(1) = Angle(B,D,E) which has measure 75°
- Angle(2) = Angle(D,B,E) which has measure 35°
- Angle(3) = Angle(A,C,E) which has measure 28°

But then there are equations involving these angles. Let me check the next parts.

Then, there are two equations:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me rephrase the equations as per the problem:

First equation: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(1)), 180). Wait, but adding them equals 180? Wait, the wording is:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)" – I think this means that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180 degrees. Similarly for the second equation.

Wait, but the way it's written might mean that each term is added step by step. For example, first add MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) and MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), then add MeasureOf(Angle(1)), and then the total is 180. But that would be redundant unless there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180.

Similarly, the second equation is:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)),180)

Which would translate to MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 180. Wait, but Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E)? Wait, according to earlier definitions:

Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E). Because the problem lists:

Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)

So, Angle(1) is Angle(B,D,E) with measure 75°, Angle(2) is Angle(D,B,E) with measure 35°, and Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E) with measure 28°.

Therefore, the first equation: Sum of MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1))? Wait, but that would be 75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180? Wait, but that can't be right because MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) is already 75, and MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 35. So adding those two gives 110, so adding MeasureOf(Angle(1)) would make the sum 110 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) would be 70. But wait, that would make angle 1 equal to 70°, which is option B. However, let me verify if that's correct.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check the exact wording of the equations again. The problem says:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)

This could be interpreted as:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

If that's the case, then substituting known values:

75 (from Angle(B,D,E)) + 35 (from Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

Adding 75 + 35 gives 110. Then 110 + x = 180 → x = 70. So MeasureOf(Angle(1)) would be 70°, which is option B. But wait, but the problem also mentions another equation:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)),180)

Which would be similar. Since Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E), which is given as 28°, and MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) is same as Angle(3). Wait, no. Wait, the third line says MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E), 28). So that's MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) is 28. And Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E), so MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is 28. Then the second equation would be:

MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. Wait, but that would be 28 + 28 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. Wait, that would imply MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 - 56 = 124°, but earlier we had MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 35°, which was supposed to be Angle(2). Wait, this seems conflicting.

Hold on, there's confusion here. Let me clarify the variables again. The problem defines:

- Angle(1) corresponds to Angle(B,D,E), which is measured as 75°
- Angle(2) corresponds to Angle(D,B,E), which is measured as 35°
- Angle(3) corresponds to Angle(A,C,E), which is measured as 28°

But then the equations are:

First equation: MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180. Which would be 75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180. So MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70. But Angle(1) is already given as Angle(B,D,E) which is 75°. Wait, that contradicts. There's something wrong here. Maybe my initial assumption about mapping the angles is incorrect.

Wait, let me go back. The problem says:

Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)
MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E), 75)
MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E), 35)
MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E), 28)

So, the three angles Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3) are the same as the three angles listed after. So:

Angle(1) = Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(2) = Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(3) = Angle(A,C,E)

Therefore, their measures are:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 75°
MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 35°
MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 28°

But then the first equation is:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(1)), 180)

Wait, this is confusing. If we take it as:

Sum of MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

But since MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) is 75, MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 35, and MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 75, then adding them gives 75+35+75= 185, which does not equal 180. So that can't be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is different. Perhaps the first equation is:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(1))

Because sometimes in geometry problems, angles around a point or supplementary angles add up. Wait, but Angle(B,D,E) and Angle(D,B,E) are adjacent angles forming a larger angle? Let me visualize triangle BDE. In triangle BDE, the angles at vertex B and E?

Wait, considering triangle BDE. The vertices are B, D, E. The angles in a triangle should add up to 180°. So, the three angles of triangle BDE are Angle at B (which is Angle(D,B,E) = 35°), Angle at D (which would be Angle(B,D,E) = 75°?), and Angle at E. Wait, but the problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E), 75). So that's angle at E? Wait, angle notation: Angle(B,D,E) is the angle at point D between points B, D, E. Wait, no. Wait, standard notation: Angle(B,D,E) is the angle at point D formed by points B-D-E. So, vertex at D, with segments BD and DE.

Similarly, Angle(D,B,E) is the angle at point B formed by points D-B-E. So, vertex at B, with segments DB and BE.

So, in triangle BDE, the angles are:

At D: Angle(B,D,E) = 75°

At B: Angle(D,B,E) = 35°

And at E: ?

So, the sum of angles in triangle BDE is 75 + 35 + angle at E = 180. Therefore, angle at E is 180 - 75 -35 = 70°. So angle at E in triangle BDE is 70°, which would be Angle(B,E,D)?

Wait, but the problem didn't mention that angle. However, the first equation in the problem may be referring to that angle.

But according to the problem's equations, the first equation is:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)

Assuming that this is saying that the sum of these three angles is 180. But if Angle(1) is Angle(B,D,E) which is 75°, then adding 75 + 35 + 75 = 185, which isn't 100% correct. So there's inconsistency here. Hence, my initial assumption about mapping the angles must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3) are different from the angles listed. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Problem says:

Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)
MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E), 75)
MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E), 35)
MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E), 28)

So, there are six angles mentioned here:

- Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3)
- Angle(B,D,E)
- Angle(D,B,E)
- Angle(A,C,E)

So, likely, Angle(1) = Angle(B,D,E), Angle(2) = Angle(D,B,E), Angle(3) = Angle(A,C,E). Therefore, their measures are 75°, 35°, and 28°, respectively.

Now, the equations:

First equation: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)

So, if that means that the sum of these three measures equals 180, then:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

Substituting:

75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → 110 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70. But Angle(1) is Angle(B,D,E), which is given as 75°. This is a contradiction. So, this suggests that my mapping is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the first equation refers to something else. Let me think again.

Perhaps the first equation is not about adding those three angles. Maybe it's structured as follows: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(1))) equals 180. But that would mean MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180. But if MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) is 75 and MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 35, then MeasureOf(Angle(1)) would need to be 70. But Angle(1) is supposed to be Angle(B,D,E), which is 75. So that doesn't fit. Hence, there must be an error in my understanding of what Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3) refer to.

Let me consider that perhaps Angle(1) is not Angle(B,D,E), but instead the third angle in triangle BDE. Earlier calculation showed that the third angle at E in triangle BDE is 70°, which wasn't mentioned before. So maybe Angle(1) is that 70° angle?

But how does that fit into the equations? Let me try that approach.

If Angle(1) is the third angle at E in triangle BDE, then its measure is 70°, which would make sense. Then, the first equation Add(...) would involve other angles.

But how do we know that? Let me look again at the equations.

The problem says:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)

Maybe this is intended to say that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180. But if Angle(1) is the third angle of triangle BDE, then that would make sense, because the sum of angles in triangle BDE is 180. So:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180

Thus, 75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70°. So Angle(1) would be 70°, which matches option B. But then, why is Angle(1) called Angle(1)? It's possible that Angle(1) refers to the third angle in triangle BDE, which is at point E. So, the angle at E in triangle BDE is 70°, which is Angle(1).

But how does this align with the rest of the problem? Let's see.

Also, there's another equation:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)),180)

Which would be MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. But Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E), which is given as 28°, and MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) is also 28°. Wait, that would be doubling the value. Unless there's a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Angle(3) is defined as Angle(A,C,E), which is the same as Angle(A,C,E). So MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is the same as MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)), which is 28°. So the equation becomes:

MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 28 + 28 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 - 56 = 124°. But earlier, MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is given as 35°, which was Angle(2). So this is a conflict.

Ah! Here's the issue. If Angle(2) is Angle(D,B,E), which is given as 35°, then the equation would require 28 + 28 + 35 = 91, which is not 180. So something is wrong here. Clearly, there's a misunderstanding in how the angles map.

Let me try a different approach. Let me focus on the equations given:

Equation 1: MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

Equation 2: MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180.

Equation 3: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2))) = 180.

From Equation 3: MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180.

But from Equation 1: MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180.

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) is 75°, and MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 35°, then plugging into Equation 1:

75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → 110 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70°.

So Angle(1) is 70°, which would be option B.

Now, from Equation 3: MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 70 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 110°. But earlier, MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is given as 35°, which would be Angle(2). This creates a contradiction unless there's a misinterpretation.

But wait, maybe Angle(2) is not Angle(D,B,E), but another angle. Let's re-examine the problem's structure.

The problem says:

Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)

So, these are six angles, but the first three are named Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3). So, it's possible that:

Angle(1) = Angle(B,D,E) (given as 75°)

Angle(2) = Angle(D,B,E) (given as 35°)

Angle(3) = Angle(A,C,E) (given as 28°)

But then Equation 1: MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → 75 + 35 + 75 = 185 ≠ 180. Contradiction.

However, if Angle(1) is not Angle(B,D,E), but something else, like the third angle in triangle BDE, then MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70°, as previously calculated, which would satisfy Equation 1. But then what is Angle(1) in terms of the problem's naming? It's unclear, but the problem asks for m∠1, so assuming that Angle(1) is the missing angle in triangle BDE, which is 70°, then the answer would be B.

Additionally, checking Equation 2: MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180. If Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E) = 28°, and MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) is also 28°, then this would be 28 + 28 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 124°. But if Angle(2) is Angle(D,B,E), which is given as 35°, this conflicts. So there's inconsistency here, suggesting that my interpretation is still wrong.

Wait, perhaps the equations are not about adding those angles directly. Let me look again at the equations as described in the problem:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(1)),180)"
"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)),180)"
"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)),MeasureOf(Angle(2))), 180)"

So, the first two Add functions seem to add three quantities and set them equal to 180. The third is that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(1)) and MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 180.

Let me write down the equations properly:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180

2. MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180

3. MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180

We also have the given measures:

- MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,E)) = 75°
- MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) = 35°
- MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) = 28°

Now, from equation 1:

75 + 35 + MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 70°

From equation 3:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 70 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 110°

Now, using equation 2:

MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180

But MeasureOf(Angle(3)) is undefined yet. Wait, what is Angle(3)? According to the problem's list, Angle(3) is Angle(A,C,E), which is given as 28°. So MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 28°, and MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) is also 28°. Thus:

28 + 28 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 56 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 124°

But from equation 3, MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 110°. This is a contradiction. So, there must be a mistake in how we're interpreting the angles.

Wait, maybe Angle(3) is not Angle(A,C,E). Let me double-check the original problem:

The problem lists:

Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(B,D,E)
Angle(D,B,E)
Angle(A,C,E)

So, these are six angles. It's possible that Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3) are not the same as the others. Maybe:

- Angle(1) = Angle(B,D,E)
- Angle(2) = Angle(D,B,E)
- Angle(3) = Angle(A,C,E)

But then, in equation 2, MeasureOf(Angle(3)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 would be 28 + 28 + 35 = 91, which is not 180. Still inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations are not about adding three angles, but something else. Let me think about the possibility of supplementary angles or vertical angles.

Looking back at the diagram, there are multiple lines and points. Point E lies on both Line(B,C) and Line(A,D). So, E is the intersection point of lines BC and AD. Also, there are triangles BDE and ACE.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Points B, D, E form a triangle. Point E is connected to A and C. Lines AE and CE are present. Also, lines BD, DE, BE, AE, CE, AC.

Now, focusing on triangle BDE: angles at B, D, E are 35°, 75°, and 70°, as calculated earlier. So angle at E is 70°. Now, angle at E in triangle BDE is 70°, which might relate to Angle(1) if it's that angle.

If Angle(1) is 70°, then from equation 3: MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 70 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 110°. But what is Angle(2)? If Angle(2) is Angle(D,B,E) = 35°, this doesn't fit. So perhaps Angle(2) is another angle.

Looking back, there's also triangle ACE. Angle(A,C,E) is 28°, which is given. So, in triangle ACE, the angles are at A, C, and E. If angle at E is 28°, then the other angles would depend on the triangle's configuration.

But there's also the fact that point E lies on Line(A,D) and Line(B,C). So, E is the intersection of AD and BC. This implies that lines AD and BC intersect at E.

Now, considering line AD: connects A and D. Line BC connects B and C. Their intersection is E.

In this setup, there might be vertical angles or other relationships. For instance, if we consider the angles at point E related to lines AD and BC.

But without seeing the actual diagram, it's challenging, but let's proceed with the given equations.

Let me assume that Angle(1) is the 70° angle at E in triangle BDE, as computed earlier. Then, from equation 1, that works out. From equation 3, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → 70 + MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 180 → MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 110°. What could Angle(2) represent?

Angle(2) could be an exterior angle or something else. Let's think: in triangle ACE, if angle at E is 28°, then maybe there's a relationship between that angle and Angle(2). Or perhaps Angle(2) is an angle formed by lines BE and something else.

Alternatively, since E is on line AD, there might be a straight line through E with points A and D. So, angle at E involving line BE and line AD.

For example, if we consider line BE intersecting line AD at E, then there might be vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Alternatively, Angle(2) could be an angle at point B, but we already have Angle(D,B,E) = 35°, which is part of triangle BDE.

Another possibility: Angle(2) is the angle at point B in triangle ACE or somewhere else.

But given the time I've spent and the equations, even though there's inconsistency in equation 2, if we ignore that for a moment, the main question is to find m∠1, which based on equation 1 and equation 3 leads us to 70°, which is option B.

Even though there's a contradiction in equation 2, it's possible that there's a mislabeling or a typo in the problem, but given the available data, the most consistent answer is 70°, which is option B.

Thus, Final Answer: B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 1 $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and the relationships among the angles:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Angles**

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle(B,D,E) ) = 75^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle(D,B,E) ) = 35^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle(A,C,E) ) = 28^\circ $

These define specific angles within the diagram. Additionally, the problem introduces abstract angles $ \angle 1 $, $ \angle 2 $, and $ \angle 3 $, which are associated with the above geometric entities. Based on the context, we interpret:

- $ \angle 1 = \angle(B,D,E) $
- $ \angle 2 = \angle(D,B,E) $
- $ \angle 3 = \angle(A,C,E) $

### **Step 2: Use the First Equation**

We are given the equation:

$$
\text{Add}(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle(B,D,E)), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle(D,B,E)), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1), 180)
$$

This implies:

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle(B,D,E)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle(D,B,E)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 180
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
75^\circ + 35^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 180^\circ
$$

$$
110^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 180^\circ
$$

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 70^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Confirm Consistency with Other Constraints**

We are also given:

$$
\text{Equals}(\text{SumOf}(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2)), 180)
$$

So,

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) = 180
$$

Using our previous result $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 70^\circ $, we compute:

$$
70^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) = 180^\circ \Rightarrow \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) = 110^\circ
$$

Note that $ \angle 2 $ is identified as $ \angle(D,B,E) $, which was originally stated as $ 35^\circ $. This discrepancy indicates that either the labeling of the angles is non-standard, or the use of $ \angle 1 $ in the equation refers to a different angle than expected.

However, despite this inconsistency, the only logical and consistent value derived from the first equation and the sum constraint is:

$$
\boxed{\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = 70^\circ}
$$

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Based on the equations and substitutions, the only consistent value for $ \angle 1 $ is:

$$
\boxed{70^\circ}
$$
