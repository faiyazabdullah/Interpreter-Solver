MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the measure of angle C, which is denoted as x. The problem gives me that angles A and B are 25 degrees and 40 degrees respectively. So, angle A is 25°, angle B is 40°, and angle C is x. 

First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. That's a fundamental theorem in geometry. So, if I add up all three angles, they should equal 180°. 

So, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°. Plugging in the known values: 25° + 40° + x = 180°. Let me calculate the sum of 25 and 40 first. 25 plus 40 is 65. So, 65° + x = 180°. To find x, I subtract 65 from both sides. That would give x = 180° - 65°, right?

Calculating that, 180 minus 65... Let me do the subtraction. 180 minus 60 is 120, then minus 5 more is 115. So, x equals 115 degrees. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 115. So, that would make sense. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, angle measures in a triangle adding up to 180—yes, that's correct. So 25 + 40 is definitely 65. Then 180 - 65 is indeed 115. Hmm. So x is 115°, so the answer should be D. Let me just confirm there's no trick here. The problem mentions points A, B, C forming a triangle, so it's a standard triangle. No mention of any special types like right-angled or equilateral, so the basic angle sum applies. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. 

But wait, sometimes people might confuse exterior angles or something else, but the problem states that the sum of the measures of the angles (which are the interior angles) equals 180. So, yes, straightforward. So, the answer is D, 115.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the measures of two angles, we can find the third by subtracting their sum from 180.  
**Step-by-Step Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - Angle(A) = 25°  
   - Angle(B) = 40°  
   - Angle(C) = x  

2. **Apply Triangle Angle Sum Theorem:**  
   $$
   \text{Angle}(A) + \text{Angle}(B) + \text{Angle}(C) = 180^\circ
   $$  
   Substituting known values:  
   $$
   25^\circ + 40^\circ + x = 180^\circ
   $$  
   Simplify:  
   $$
   65^\circ + x = 180^\circ
   $$  
   Solve for $x$:  
   $$
   x = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
   $$  

**Conclusion:** The measure of angle $C$ is $115^\circ$, corresponding to answer choice **D**.
