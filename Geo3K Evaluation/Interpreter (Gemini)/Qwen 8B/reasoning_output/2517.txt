MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, F. The lines BA, BC, BD, BF are all starting from point B. There are several angles mentioned here. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given information.

First, it says that vectors BA and BC are opposite rays. Wait, opposite rays mean they form a straight line, right? So if BA and BC are opposite rays, then points A, B, and C must be colinear with B between A and C. That makes sense because opposite rays start at the same point and go in opposite directions. So angle ABC would be a straight angle, which is 180 degrees. But wait, there's also another angle mentioned involving point D and F. Hmm.

Then, BD bisects angle ABF. So BD splits angle ABF into two equal parts. Also, we're given some equations for the measures of angles FBC and ABF. Let me note down the given equations:

m∠FBC = 2x + 25°
m∠ABF = 10x - 1°
And these two angles add up to 180°, so their sum equals 180. 

Wait, the problem states that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,C))) = 180. So ∠ABF + ∠FBC = 180°. Therefore, substituting the expressions:

(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180

Let me compute that:

Combine like terms: 10x + 2x = 12x; -1 +25=24. So 12x +24 = 180.

Subtracting 24 from both sides: 12x = 156. Then divide by 12: x = 13. 

So x is 13. Now, substitute back to find the measures of those angles.

First, ∠ABF = 10x -1 = 10*13 -1 = 130 -1 = 129°

∠FBC = 2x +25 = 2*13 +25 = 26 +25 = 51°

Check if they add up to 180: 129 +51=180. Yes, that works. Good.

Now, BD bisects angle ABF. Wait, angle ABF is 129°, so if BD bisects it, then each part would be half of 129°, but wait, hold on. Wait, angle ABF is being bisected by BD. Wait, but angle ABF is between BA and BF. Wait, but earlier, BA and BC are opposite rays, meaning BA and BC are in opposite directions. So point C is in the direction opposite to BA. So maybe the diagram has BA going one way, BC going the other. Then BF is somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I need to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me think again.

Since BA and BC are opposite rays, then BA and BC are in opposite directions. So imagine point B, with BA going left and BC going right. Then, point F is somewhere such that BF forms an angle with BA. Also, BD is a bisector of angle ABF. So angle ABF is formed by BA and BF. Since BA is one ray, BF is another. BD bisects that angle. So BD divides angle ABF into two equal angles. So angle ABD and angle DBF are equal. Therefore, measure of angle DBF is half of angle ABF. Wait, but angle ABF is 129°, so half of that is 64.5°, which is option D. But wait, let me check again.

But hold on, maybe there's more to it. Because BD is the bisector of angle ABF, so yes, splitting it into two equal angles. So if angle ABF is 129°, then each part is 64.5°, which would make angle DBF equal to 64.5°, which is option D. However, let me check if there's something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe BD isn't directly related to angle ABF? Wait, no. The problem says "BD bisects angle ABF". So BD is the bisector of angle ABF. Therefore, angle ABD equals angle DBF. Hence, since angle ABF is 129°, each part is 129 / 2 = 64.5°, which is answer D. But let me check if there's another consideration.

Wait, but angle FBC is given as 51°, which is adjacent to angle ABF? Wait, since BA and BC are opposite rays, then angle ABC is a straight angle (180°). So, if we consider point F, then BF is some ray from B. Let me think about how the angles relate.

So, since BA and BC are opposite rays, then angle ABC is 180°. Now, BF is another ray from B. So depending on where F is located, angles around B can be considered.

Given that angle ABF is 129°, which is measured from BA to BF. Since BA and BC are opposite, then angle between BF and BC would be angle FBC, which is 51°, as computed earlier. Because angle ABF + angle FBC should be equal to angle ABC, which is 180°, and indeed 129 + 51 = 180. So that checks out.

Therefore, BD bisects angle ABF (which is 129°), so each part is 64.5°, making angle DBF equal to 64.5°, which is option D. However, let me check again if BD is the bisector of angle ABF. The problem statement says: "BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(A,B,F))", meaning BD bisects angle ABF. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the answer choices include D as 64.5, which matches our calculation. However, sometimes problems might involve other considerations, like overlapping angles or different configurations. Let me confirm once more.

Another approach: Let me write down all known angles.

We know:

- ∠ABF = 10x -1 = 129°
- ∠FBC = 2x +25 = 51°
- BD bisects ∠ABF, so ∠ABD = ∠DBF = 129° / 2 = 64.5°, hence ∠DBF = 64.5°, which is answer D.

Yes, that seems straightforward. So why is there an option D? Let me check the answer choices again:

A. 25.5

B. 50

C. 54

D. 64.5

Yes, D is 64.5. Therefore, the answer should be D.

Wait, but just to make sure there's no mistake in solving for x. Let me recheck:

Original equation:

Sum of ∠ABF and ∠FBC equals 180°:

(10x -1) + (2x +25) = 180

Combine terms:

10x + 2x = 12x

-1 +25 = 24

Thus, 12x +24 = 180 → 12x = 156 → x = 13. Correct.

Then ∠ABF = 10*13 -1 = 130 -1 = 129. Correct.

∠FBC = 2*13 +25 = 26+25=51. Correct. Their sum is 180. Perfect.

So BD bisects angle ABF, so ∠ABF is split into two equal angles. Thus, ∠DBF is half of 129, which is 64.5. So answer D.

I don't see any errors in this reasoning. So the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle DBF$, we begin by analyzing the relationships among the given angles and using algebraic and geometric principles.

---

### Step 1: Understand Given Constraints

We are told:

- Points $A$, $B$, and $C$ lie on a straight line such that $\vec{BA}$ and $\vec{BC}$ are **opposite rays**. This implies that $\angle ABC = 180^\circ$.
- Line segments $BF$ and $BD$ emanate from point $B$. 
- It is stated that **$\vec{BD}$ bisects $\angle ABF$**, i.e., it splits $\angle ABF$ into two congruent angles.
- We are given:
  $$
  \text{Measure}(\angle FBC) = 2x + 25,\quad \text{Measure}(\angle ABF) = 10x - 1
  $$
  and
  $$
  \text{Measure}(\angle ABF) + \text{Measure}(\angle FBC) = 180^\circ
  $$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $x$

Using the given relationship:
$$
(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180
$$
Simplify:
$$
12x + 24 = 180
\Rightarrow 12x = 156
\Rightarrow x = 13
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Measures of Angles

Plug $x = 13$ into the given expressions:

- $\angle ABF = 10x - 1 = 10(13) - 1 = 129^\circ$
- $\angle FBC = 2x + 25 = 2(13) + 25 = 51^\circ$

These values satisfy:
$$
\angle ABF + \angle FBC = 129 + 51 = 180^\circ
$$
This confirms consistency with the condition that $\angle ABC = 180^\circ$, as expected from the fact that $\vec{BA}$ and $\vec{BC}$ are opposite rays.

---

### Step 4: Use the Bisector Property

It is given that **$\vec{BD}$ bisects $\angle ABF$**. Since $\angle ABF = 129^\circ$, the bisector divides it into two equal parts:

$$
\angle ABD = \angle DBF = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 129^\circ = 64.5^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

The measure of $\angle DBF$ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{64.5}
$$
