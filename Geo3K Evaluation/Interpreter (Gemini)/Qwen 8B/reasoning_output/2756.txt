MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the perimeter of triangle WXZ, which is similar to triangle SRT. The given information includes that ST is 6 units, WX is 5 units, and the perimeter of triangle SRT is 15. Also, there's a ratio relationship between their perimeters and sides.

First, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of similarity should be the same for all corresponding sides. The problem mentions that the ratio of the lengths of WX to ST is equal to the ratio of their perimeters. Let me write down what I know:

Given:
- Triangle WXZ ~ Triangle SRT
- WX = 5
- ST = 6
- Perimeter of SRT = 15
- Need to find perimeter of WXZ.

Since they're similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let's call the ratio k. So, k = WX / ST = 5/6. That means each side of triangle WXZ is (5/6) times the corresponding side of triangle SRT.

But wait, the perimeter of similar figures scales by the same ratio. Therefore, the perimeter of WXZ should be k multiplied by the perimeter of SRT. 

So, perimeter of WXZ = k * perimeter of SRT = (5/6) * 15. Let me calculate that: 15 divided by 6 is 2.5, then multiplied by 5 gives 12.5. Hmm, so 12.5 would be the perimeter. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 12.5. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, another way to think about it: Since the ratio of perimeters is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides. Given that the ratio of WX to ST is 5/6, then the ratio of perimeters should also be 5/6. Therefore, perimeter of WXZ is (5/6)*perimeter of SRT. Which again is (5/6)*15 = 12.5. So that seems right.

But let me confirm that there isn't any missing piece here. For example, maybe I need to check if the perimeter of SRT is indeed related correctly. Wait, the perimeter of SRT is given as 15. So yes, multiplying by the ratio 5/6 gives 12.5. So answer A is 12.5. But looking back at the answer choices, A is 12.5, so that's the answer. However, sometimes problems might have tricks, but in this case, the logic seems straightforward. The key was recognizing that the ratio of perimeters equals the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles. 

Alternatively, maybe I can verify using individual sides. Suppose the sides of triangle SRT are such that their sum is 15. Let's say the sides are a, b, c. Then a + b + c = 15. The sides of triangle WXZ would be (5/6)a, (5/6)b, (5/6)c. Adding them together gives (5/6)(a + b + c) = (5/6)*15 = 12.5. Yep, same result. So definitely, the perimeter is 12.5, which is option A. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The answer should be A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $, we start by analyzing the given relationships and applying the principles of similar triangles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are told that:
- $ \triangle WXZ \sim \triangle SRT $
- $ WX = 5 $
- $ ST = 6 $
- Perimeter of $ \triangle SRT = 15 $

From the definition of **similar triangles**, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is constant across all pairs of corresponding sides. This implies that the ratio of the perimeters of two similar triangles is equal to the ratio of any pair of corresponding sides.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Scale Factor**

Letâ€™s denote the scale factor (ratio of similarity) as $ k $. Using the given side lengths:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}
$$

This scale factor applies uniformly to all corresponding sides and to the entire perimeters of the triangles.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $**

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three side lengths. Because the triangles are similar, the perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $ will be scaled by the same factor $ k $ as the perimeter of $ \triangle SRT $:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle WXZ = k \times \text{Perimeter of } \triangle SRT = \frac{5}{6} \times 15
$$

$$
= \frac{75}{6} = 12.5
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $ is therefore $ 12.5 $, which matches **Option A**.

### **Final Answer:**
Final Answer: A
