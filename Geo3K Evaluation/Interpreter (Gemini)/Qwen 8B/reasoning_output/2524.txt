MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the circle Z with points V, W, X, Y, U on it. Since VY and WU are diameters, that means lines VY and WU pass through the center Z. So, Z is the center of the circle because those lines are radii extended to diameters. 

Given that angles at Z: angle WZX and angle XZY are congruent. Also, m∠VZU is 4x, and m∠UZY is 2x + 24. The sum of these two angles is 180 degrees. Let me write down the equations based on the information.

First, since VY and WU are diameters, then points V and Y are endpoints of one diameter, and W and U are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, angles subtended by these diameters would be right angles? Wait, no. Wait, if you have a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, then it's a right angle. But here we're dealing with central angles, not inscribed angles. 

But the angles mentioned here are at the center Z. For example, ∠WZX is formed by points W, Z, X. Since W and X are both on the circle, and Z is the center, so segments WZ and XZ are radii. Similarly for other angles. 

So, the measure of each central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. So, for instance, ∠WZX corresponds to arc WX, and ∠XZY corresponds to arc XY. Given that these two angles are congruent, arcs WX and XY are equal in measure. 

Also, we know that m∠VZU = 4x and m∠UZY = 2x + 24. Also, their sum equals 180 degrees. Let me check the problem statement again. It says:

Add(MeasureOf(Angle(V,Z,U)),MeasureOf(Angle(U,Z,Y))) Equals(SumOf(...),180). So, m∠VZU + m∠UZY = 180°. 

So substituting the expressions:

4x + (2x + 24) = 180  
Combine like terms: 6x + 24 = 180  
Subtract 24: 6x = 156  
Divide by 6: x = 26. 

Wait, so x is 26. Then m∠VZU is 4x = 104°, and m∠UZY is 2x +24 = 52 +24=76°. Let me confirm that 104+76 is indeed 180. Yes, 104+76=180. That checks out. 

Now, the question asks for m(arc WUX). Wait, the notation is m widehat WUX. Arc WUX. So, starting at point W, going through U, then to X. So that arc spans from W to X passing through U. Alternatively, maybe it's the major arc? Or minor arc? Depending on the positions of the points. 

But first, let me think about how the points are arranged. Since VY and WU are diameters. Let me try to sketch mentally. Let me consider the circle with center Z. Points V and Y are endpoints of one diameter, so they are directly opposite each other. Similarly, W and U are endpoints of another diameter. 

Let me note that angles at Z: 

- Angle VZU is between points V, Z, U. So that angle is formed by radii ZV and ZU. Similarly, angle UZY is between U, Z, Y. 

Since VY is a diameter, then moving from V to Y passes through Z. Similarly for WU. Now, considering the angles given. 

We can also note that the total around point Z is 360 degrees. Let me see. The angles around Z should add up to 360 degrees. Let me try to find the measures of different arcs. 

First, since ∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY, which implies that arc WX equals arc XY. Let me denote the measure of arc WX as α, so arc XY is also α. 

Then, what about the rest of the circle? Let me think about the other arcs. Let me consider the entire circle. Starting from W, going through X, then to Y, but also there's V and U. Maybe I need to relate the angles given. 

Alternatively, since we have angles involving VZU and UZY. Let me focus on those. 

The angle VZU is 4x = 104°, which is the central angle between V and U. So, the arc from V to U is 104°. Similarly, angle UZY is 76°, which is the central angle between U and Y. Therefore, arc from U to Y is 76°. 

Now, since VY is a diameter, the arc from V to Y is 180°, because it's a straight line through the center. Therefore, arc VY is 180°. 

But arc VY can also be broken into arc VU plus arc UY. From earlier, arc VU is 104°, and arc UY is 76°, adding to 104+76=180°, which matches. Good. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc WUX. Let me clarify: arc WUX would start at W, go through U, then to X. So that's arc WU plus arc UX. Wait, but arc WU is a diameter, so it's 180°, but wait, no. Wait, arc WU is part of the circle. Wait, W and U are endpoints of a diameter, so arc WU is 180°, but that's only if we take the shorter arc. However, depending on the position of X, arc WUX could be different. 

Wait, perhaps I need to figure out where X is located. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram. 

We have diameters VY and WU. Let me imagine the circle with center Z. Let me place point V somewhere on the circle, then Y is directly opposite. Similarly, W and U are on another diameter. Now, we have angles ∠WZX and ∠XZY being congruent. 

Let me consider that ∠WZX is the angle between WZ and XZ, and ∠XZY is the angle between XZ and YZ. Since these are congruent, then arc WX equals arc XY. 

Earlier, we had that arc UY is 76°, and arc VU is 104°. Let me try to find other arcs. 

Starting from point W, moving along the circumference. Let me think about the positions. Suppose I arrange the points such that diameters VY and WU intersect at Z. Let me assume that the order of points around the circle is important. 

Let me try to list the arcs we know. 

Arc VU is 104°, arc UY is 76°, making arc VY 180°, as expected. 

Now, what about the other arcs? We have points W and X. Since ∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY, meaning arc WX equals arc XY. Let me denote arc WX as α, so arc XY is also α. 

Therefore, arc XY = α. 

Now, the entire circle is 360°, so the sum of all arcs should be 360°. Let me see. 

If I can express all arcs in terms of known quantities and α. 

Let me consider the arcs:

- Arc VW: ?
- Arc WX: α
- Arc XY: α
- Arc YU: ? 
Wait, but maybe I need to think differently. 

Wait, the circle has points V, W, X, Y, U. Let me think about the arrangement. 

Since W and U are endpoints of a diameter, then arc WU is 180°, but that's just the arc between W and U. However, depending on where X is, the arc WX and arc XY may be parts of the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe we can look at the entire circle as composed of several arcs. Let me attempt to break down the circle into arcs based on the points. 

Let me note that the circle includes arcs between V-W, W-X, X-Y, Y-U, and U-V? Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, since we have diameters VY and WU, which cross at Z. Let me imagine that the diameters VY and WU intersect at Z. So, depending on the angles between them, the arcs will vary. 

But perhaps we can use the angles at Z. 

For instance, angle between WZ and XZ is α (since ∠WZX = α), and angle between XZ and YZ is also α. Therefore, the total angle from WZ to YZ is α + α = 2α. 

Additionally, we have angles related to VZU and UZY. 

Let me think about the full rotation around Z. The angles at Z are:

- From VZ to WZ: ?
- From WZ to XZ: α
- From XZ to YZ: α
- From YZ to UZ: 76° (from angle UZY)
- From UZ to VZ: 104° (from angle VZU)

Wait, but how do these angles fit together? 

Wait, the angles around point Z should add up to 360 degrees. So, if I consider the angles between each pair of adjacent radii. 

Assuming that the points are ordered around the circle in some sequence. Let me suppose that the order is V, W, X, Y, U, back to V. But not sure. 

Alternatively, since VY and WU are diameters, they might intersect at Z, forming vertical angles. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, maybe I need to approach this algebraically. 

Let me consider that from point Z, the angles between the radii:

- Between VZ and WZ: let's call this angle θ
- Between WZ and XZ: α
- Between XZ and YZ: α
- Between YZ and UZ: β
- Between UZ and VZ: γ

These angles θ, α, α, β, γ should add up to 360 degrees. 

But we also know that angle between UZ and VZ is 104°, which is given as m∠VZU = 4x = 104°. So γ = 104°. Also, angle between YZ and UZ is 76°, which is m∠UZY = 2x + 24 = 76°, so β = 76°. 

So, putting that in:

θ + α + α + β + γ = 360  
θ + 2α + 76 + 104 = 360  
θ + 2α + 180 = 360  
θ + 2α = 180  
So θ = 180 - 2α. 

But what is θ? θ is the angle between VZ and WZ. Which would correspond to the arc from V to W. 

But how does this help us? Well, perhaps we need more relations. 

Alternatively, since VY is a diameter, the arc from V to Y is 180°, which is composed of arc VU (which is 104°, as per angle VZU) plus arc UY (which is 76°, as per angle UZY). So that adds up. 

Now, the arc from V to Y is 180°, which is also equal to arc VU + arc UY = 104 + 76 = 180. Correct. 

Now, let me think about the other diameter WU. The arc from W to U is 180°, as it's a diameter. 

But how does that relate to the other arcs? If I can express the arc from W to U as the sum of arcs from W to X to Y to U? No, not necessarily. 

Wait, the arc from W to U can be split into arc W to X to Y to U? Not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, the arc from W to U is 180°, so if I can find the relationship between arc WX and arc WU. 

Wait, we have arc WX = α. And arc XY = α. Then, arc from X to Y is α. 

If I can find the arc from W to X, which is α, and arc from X to Y is α. So, arc from W to Y is α + α = 2α. 

But arc from W to Y can also be determined. How?

Well, since VY is a diameter, and W is another point. Maybe there's a way to relate arcs. 

Alternatively, let me consider the entire circle. Let me try to calculate the total arcs. 

Total circle is 360°, so:

arc VW + arc WX + arc XY + arc YU + arc UV = 360° ?

Wait, but arc UV is 104°, arc YU is 76°, arc XY is α, arc WX is α, and arc VW is ?. 

Wait, but arc VW would depend on where W is placed relative to V. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to find the value of α. 

From earlier, we have θ = 180 - 2α, where θ is the angle between VZ and WZ. This angle θ corresponds to arc VW. 

But how can I find θ? 

Wait, if we can find another relation involving θ. 

Alternatively, since WU is a diameter, the arc from W to U is 180°, which can be broken into arc W to X to Y to U? Wait, no. Let me think. 

From point W to U, the arc could be either the direct diameter (180°) or the longer path. But since we have points X and Y, perhaps the arc from W to U goes through X and Y? 

Alternatively, arc W to U could consist of arc WX + arc XY + arc YU. Wait, arc WX is α, arc XY is α, arc YU is 76°, so total arc W to U via X and Y is α + α + 76°. But since arc WU is a diameter, it's 180°, so:

α + α + 76 = 180  
=> 2α + 76 = 180  
=> 2α = 104  
=> α = 52°

Ah! That seems promising. Because if the arc from W to U passing through X and Y is equal to the length of the diameter arc, which is 180°, then:

arc WX + arc XY + arc YU = 180°  
Which gives 2α + 76 = 180 => α = 52°. 

So, α is 52°, which means arc WX is 52°, and arc XY is also 52°. 

Great! Now, with α known, we can proceed. 

Now, the question is asking for m(arc WUX). 

Arc WUX starts at W, goes through U, then to X. Wait, but U is an endpoint of diameter WU. So, arc WUX would be from W to X passing through U. 

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. The arc from W to X passing through U. 

So, the arc WUX would be arc WU plus arc UX. Wait, but arc WU is 180°, and arc UX is... Hmm. Wait, arc UX depends on where X is located. 

Wait, but since arc WX is 52°, and arc WU is 180°, then arc from W to X is 52°, but arc from W to U is 180°, so arc from X to U would be arc WU minus arc WX, which is 180° - 52° = 128°. 

Wait, but arc UX would be the same as arc from X to U, which is 128°, assuming we're taking the minor arc. 

But the arc WUX is the arc from W to X passing through U. So, that would be arc WU (180°) plus arc UX? No, that would exceed the circle. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

If we traverse from W to X passing through U, that would mean going from W to U (which is 180°) and then from U to X. Wait, but that would make the arc WUX as arc WU + arc UX, but that would be more than half the circle unless X is positioned appropriately. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX refers to the arc from W to X that passes through U. In that case, the arc would consist of arc WU (180°) plus arc UX. But that seems too long. Wait, but maybe X is located such that when you go from W to X through U, it's a specific arc. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the arc. Let me re-examine. 

The measure of arc WUX. In standard notation, the arc WUX would be the arc that starts at W, ends at X, and passes through U. So, the arc from W to X that goes through U. To compute this, we need to determine the measure of that particular arc. 

To find that, we can think of the arc from W to X passing through U. Let's break it down. 

Starting at W, going to U (which is 180°), then from U to X. So, the arc from U to X. What's the measure of arc UX?

Earlier, we had that arc WX is 52°, and arc WU is 180°. So, arc from W to X is 52°, which is the minor arc. But if we go from W to X through U, that would be the major arc WX. 

Wait, the major arc WX would be 360° - 52° = 308°, but that seems too big. Alternatively, if we consider the arc from W to X passing through U, it's possible that it's the major arc. 

Wait, but how can we find the measure of arc WUX? 

Alternatively, let me think about the positions. 

We have arc WX = 52°, arc XY = 52°, arc YU = 76°, arc UV = 104°, and arc VW is θ = 180 - 2α = 180 - 104 = 76°, from earlier. 

Wait, earlier we had θ = 180 - 2α, and since α = 52°, θ = 180 - 104 = 76°. So arc VW is 76°. 

So, let's summarize the arcs:

- arc VW: 76°
- arc WX: 52°
- arc XY: 52°
- arc YU: 76°
- arc UV: 104°

Adding these up: 76 + 52 + 52 + 76 + 104 = let's compute:

76 + 52 = 128; 128 + 52 = 180; 180 + 76 = 256; 256 + 104 = 360. Perfect, that adds up to 360°. 

Now, the arc WUX: starting at W, going through U to X. So, from W to U is arc WU, which is 180°, and then from U to X. Wait, but how much is arc from U to X? 

Looking at our arcs above, from U to X would be arc UY + arc YX? Wait, arc from U to X can be broken down. Let me see. 

From U to X, we can go through Y and X. Let me check the arcs. 

From U to Y is 76°, and from Y to X is 52°, so arc UYX is 76 + 52 = 128°. Wait, but that would be the arc from U to X passing through Y. Alternatively, the arc from U to X directly. 

But given the current arcs, the arc from U to X can be calculated. 

Alternatively, since the total circle is 360°, and we have arc from U to X. Let me think. 

The arc from U to X can be found by subtracting the other arcs. Let me think. 

Starting from U, going counterclockwise to X. Let me check the positions. 

Assume the order of points around the circle is V, W, X, Y, U, back to V. But not sure. Let me think based on the arcs. 

If arc VW is 76°, arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°, arc YU is 76°, and arc UV is 104°. 

So, arranging the points in order: V, W, X, Y, U, and then back to V. 

So, the order is V -> W -> X -> Y -> U -> V. 

Thus, arc from U to X would go through Y and X? Wait, no. From U to X, going counterclockwise, it would pass through Y and X? Wait, if the order is V, W, X, Y, U, then from U to X, going counterclockwise would pass through Y and X? Wait, no. From U to X, going counterclockwise would pass through Y and then X. So, arc UX is arc UY + arc YX = 76 + 52 = 128°, as before. 

Alternatively, the arc from U to X clockwise would be arc UX', where X' is the other direction. But since we are talking about arc WUX, which goes through U, so it's the arc from W to X passing through U. 

So, starting at W, going through U to X. That would be arc WU (180°) plus arc UX (which is 128°)? No, that would be double-counting. Wait, no. If you go from W to U (180°), then from U to X (128°), but that would imply the arc from W to X via U is 180 + 128 = 308°, which is the major arc WX. 

But the measure of arc WUX is the measure of the arc from W to X passing through U, which is the major arc WX, measuring 308°. However, looking at the answer choices, none of them is 308. The options are A.52, B.104, C.154, D.308. Oh, option D is 308. 

Wait, but the problem says "Find m widehat WUX". Is that the major arc or minor arc? Typically, the notation with three letters like WUX implies the arc that passes through U, so it's the major arc. However, sometimes it's ambiguous, but in most cases, it's assumed to be the arc that doesn't contain the third point, but in this case, since U is in between W and X, it's the major arc. 

However, let me verify. Let me check my calculation again. 

If the arc WUX is the major arc WX, then it's 308°, which is option D. However, let me check whether there's another interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX is referring to the arc from W to U to X, meaning arc WU plus arc UX. But arc WU is 180°, arc UX is 128°, totaling 308°, same as before. 

But the answer choices include D.308, so that would be the answer. However, let me check if there's a mistake here. 

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "m widehat WUX", which usually denotes the arc from W to X passing through U. So yes, that would be the major arc WX, which is 308°, hence answer D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating arc UX. 

Earlier, we said arc UX is arc UY + arc YX = 76 + 52 = 128°, which is correct. Then, the major arc WX is 360 - arc WX = 360 - 52 = 308°, which is the same as arc WUX. 

Yes, so answer D. However, let me check the answer choices again. The options are A.52, B.104, C.154, D.308. So D is 308. But maybe the problem expects the minor arc? But why? 

Wait, but the question says "m widehat WUX". The notation with three points typically specifies the arc that passes through the middle point. So, WUX would be the arc from W to X passing through U, which is the major arc, hence 308°, which is D. 

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, maybe the arc WUX is supposed to be the arc from W to U to X, but that's not standard notation. Usually, the arc is named by its endpoints with the middle letter indicating the direction, but if it's a single arc, it's just the arc between the two endpoints. However, if the arc is specified with three points, it's the arc that passes through the third point. 

So, according to that, arc WUX is the arc from W to X passing through U, which is the major arc. Hence, 308°, which is option D. 

But let me check once more. Maybe I messed up the arc calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX is meant to be something else. Let me think. 

Suppose the arc WUX is the arc from W to X, which is 52°, but that's the minor arc. But then why mention U? Unless there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, the problem states that WU is a diameter, so points W and U are separated by 180°. So, if we have points W, U, and X, then arc WUX would be from W to X passing through U. 

Another way to think: since WU is a diameter, then the arc from W to U is 180°, and arc from U to X is ...? 

Earlier, we had arc from U to X as 128°, so total arc from W to X through U is 180 + 128 = 308°, which is the major arc. 

Hence, the measure is 308°, which is answer D. 

But wait, the answer choices include D.308, so that's likely the answer. However, let me check if there's another approach where the answer is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question wants the measure of the arc WUX as the sum of arcs WU and UX? But arc WU is 180°, arc UX is 128°, so 180 + 128 = 308, same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating α. Let me recheck. 

We had that arc from W to U through X and Y was α + α + 76 = 180. Solving for α gave 2α +76 = 180 → α = 52. That seems correct. 

With α = 52°, arc WX = 52°, arc XY = 52°, arc YU =76°, arc UV = 104°, arc VW =76°, adding to 360. All good. 

So, arc WUX is 308°, which is answer D. 

But let me check the answer choices again. Option D is 308, which is present. However, sometimes problems expect the smaller arc, but in this case, since the arc is passing through U, which is a diameter, it's the larger arc. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the arc WUX as the arc from W to U to X, meaning the arc from W to U (180°) plus arc from U to X (which is 128°), totaling 308°. 

So, I think D is correct. 

But wait, looking back at the problem statement: 

"Find m widehat WUX."

But maybe there's a misunderstanding in the notation. Sometimes, the arc notation is used for the minor arc unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, since the arc passes through U, it's the major arc. But without more context, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let me think again. Another way: maybe the arc WUX is the arc from W to X, and the measure is computed using the central angles. 

Alternatively, since angle WZX is 52°, and angle XZY is 52°, then arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°, so arc WY is arc WX + arc XY = 104°. Then, arc WY is 104°, and arc YU is 76°, so arc WU is arc WY + arc YU = 104 +76 = 180°, which makes sense since WU is a diameter. 

Now, what about arc WUX? If we consider arc WUX as the arc from W to X passing through U, which is the major arc WX, which is 360 - arc WX = 360 -52 = 308°, which is answer D. 

So, I think D is correct. 

But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A.52, B.104, C.154, D.308. So, 308 is option D. 

But wait, sometimes, in some textbooks, the arc measure is taken as the smaller one unless stated otherwise. However, given that the arc passes through U, which is a diameter, it's likely the major arc. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. 

We know that the measure of arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°, arc YU is 76°, arc UV is 104°, arc VW is 76°. 

What's the measure of arc WUX? 

If we consider the arc from W to X passing through U, then we have arc from W to U (180°) plus arc from U to X. Arc from U to X is arc UY + arc YX = 76° +52° = 128°, so total arc WUX is 180 +128 = 308°. 

Yes, same as before. 

So, the answer is D. 

But wait, the answer choices don't have 308? Wait, yes, option D is 308. 

But let me check the initial problem again to ensure I didn't misread anything. 

The problem says: 

"In ⊙Z, ∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY, m∠VZU = 4x, m∠UZY = 2x + 24, and VY and WU are diameters. Find m widehat WUX."

Yes, so the arc WUX is asked. 

Therefore, the answer should be D.308. 

But I need to make sure that there isn't a miscalculation. 

Let me recapitulate:

- Found x = 26. 

- Calculated arc WX = arc XY = 52°, arc UY = 76°, arc UV = 104°, arc VW = 76°.

- Total circle: 76 + 52 + 52 + 76 + 104 = 360°, correct.

- Arc WUX is major arc WX, which is 360 - 52 = 308°, which is option D. 

Yes. 

But wait, let me check if there's a different interpretation. For example, if arc WUX is considered as the arc from W to U to X, which would be arc WU + arc UX. Arc WU is 180°, arc UX is arc from U to X. 

How much is arc UX? From earlier, arc from U to X is 128°, as explained. So, 180 + 128 = 308°, same result. 

Therefore, the answer is D. 

But wait, looking back at the original problem, the answer choices are A.52, B.104, C.154, D.308. So, D is 308. 

Therefore, Final Answer: D.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

We are given a circle $ \odot Z $ with several points on the circle and certain relationships among them. Our goal is to **find the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Information**

- **Points on Circle**: V, W, X, Y, U lie on the circle centered at Z.
- **Diameters**: VY and WU are diameters ⇒ Lines VY and WU pass through the center Z.
- **Angles at Center Z**:
  - $ \angle WZX \cong \angle XZY $
  - $ m\angle VZU = 4x $
  - $ m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 $

---

### **Step 2: Solve for x Using Sum of Angles**

From the problem, we are told:

$$
m\angle VZU + m\angle UZY = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute values:

$$
4x + (2x + 24) = 180 \\
6x + 24 = 180 \\
6x = 156 \\
x = 26
$$

Now substitute back:

- $ m\angle VZU = 4x = 104^\circ $
- $ m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 = 76^\circ $

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Arcs Based on Central Angles**

Central angles correspond directly to the measure of their intercepted arcs.

- $ m\angle VZU = 104^\circ \Rightarrow \text{arc } VU = 104^\circ $
- $ m\angle UZY = 76^\circ \Rightarrow \text{arc } UY = 76^\circ $
- $ \angle WZX \cong \angle XZY \Rightarrow \text{arc } WX = \text{arc } XY $

Let’s define:

- $ \text{arc } WX = \alpha \Rightarrow \text{arc } XY = \alpha $

Now, we can determine the measure of arc $ WU $, which is a diameter:

- $ \text{arc } WU = 180^\circ $

This arc can also be expressed as:

$$
\text{arc } WU = \text{arc } WX + \text{arc } XY + \text{arc } YU = \alpha + \alpha + 76 = 2\alpha + 76
$$

Set equal to 180°:

$$
2\alpha + 76 = 180 \\
2\alpha = 104 \\
\alpha = 52^\circ
$$

So,

- $ \text{arc } WX = \text{arc } XY = 52^\circ $

---

### **Step 4: Determine Measure of Arc $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $**

We are asked to find the **measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $**, i.e., the arc from W to X **passing through U**.

This arc consists of:

- $ \text{arc } WU = 180^\circ $ (as WU is a diameter)
- $ \text{arc } UX = \text{arc } UY + \text{arc } YX = 76^\circ + 52^\circ = 128^\circ $

Therefore, the total arc measure:

$$
\text{arc } WUX = \text{arc } WU + \text{arc } UX = 180^\circ + 128^\circ = 308^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $ is $ 308^\circ $. Among the given answer choices, **option D** matches this value.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{D}
$$
