Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have several points and lines with some angles and parallel lines. The goal is to find the value of x based on the given equations and angle relationships. 

First, I need to visualize the diagram. Let me note down all the given information:

Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Then there are lines connecting these points. Also, several angles are defined with specific measures related to variables x and y. The key thing here is that certain lines are parallel, which probably means we can use properties like corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc.

Let me start by listing out all the given angle equalities and equations:

1. Angle(D,A,F) = Angle(A,F,D). Wait, but angle(DAF) and angle(AFD)? Wait, no. Wait, the notation might be important here. In angle(D,A,F), the vertex is point A, so it's ∠DAF. Similarly, angle(A,F,D) would be ∠AFD? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the notation. Typically, angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So angle(D,A,F) is the angle at point A between points D and F. So ∠DAF. Similarly, angle(A,F,D) would be the angle at point F between points A and D, which is ∠AFD. But according to the given equality, measure of angle(D,A,F) equals measure of angle(A,F,D). So ∠DAF = ∠AFD. Hmm. That suggests that triangle AFD has two equal angles, meaning it's an isosceles triangle with sides AD = FD? Or wait, maybe not directly. Because if two angles are equal, then their opposite sides are equal. Wait, but the angles are at different vertices. Let me think.

Wait, in triangle AFD, if ∠DAF (at A) equals ∠AFD (at F), then the triangle is isosceles with AF = AD? Because in a triangle, equal angles correspond to equal opposite sides. So ∠DAF is at A, opposite side DF. ∠AFD is at F, opposite side AD. Therefore, if those angles are equal, then DF = AD. So that gives us some relationship between segments, but maybe that's not immediately helpful yet.

But also, another equation says that measure of angle(D,A,E) equals measure of angle(A,F,D). Wait, angle(D,A,E) is ∠DAE, and angle(A,F,D) is ∠AFD. So ∠DAE = ∠AFD. And earlier, ∠DAF = ∠AFD. So combining these, ∠DAE = ∠DAF. Which implies that ∠DAE = ∠DAF. So that suggests that points E and F lie such that when you look at angles at A involving D and E vs D and F, they are equal. Maybe there's something about the lines being parallel?

Also, given that lines HB and GD are parallel, as well as GD and AE. So line GD is parallel to both HB and AE. Since GD || AE, and GD || HB, so HB || AE. Also, line HC is parallel to line AF. So HC || AF.

So perhaps there are some transversals cutting these parallel lines, creating corresponding angles or alternate angles. Let me try to sketch mentally the setup.

Starting with points A, D, E connected via line AE. Points H, B connected via HB. Lines GD and AE are parallel. Also, line GD is connected to points G and D. Line HC is connected to H and C, which is parallel to AF. Also, line AF connects A to F. 

Given the angles:

- Measure of angle(D,A,F) = 7x + 9 degrees. Wait, the first equation says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9)). So ∠DAF = 7x + 9.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1)). So ∠DAE = 11x - 1.

Another equation: Measure of angle(A,D,E) = Sub(Mul(7,y), 4). So ∠ADE = 7y - 4.

Then, measure of angle(E,A,B) = Add(Mul(2,y), 5). So ∠EAB = 2y + 5.

Additionally, the equations say that measure of angle(D,A,F) equals measure of angle(A,F,D). Wait, but earlier we said ∠DAF = ∠AFD. So that gives us ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9. Also, measure of angle(D,A,E) equals measure of angle(A,F,D). So ∠DAE = ∠AFD. Which would mean ∠DAE = 7x + 9. But from above, ∠DAE is also given as 11x - 1. Therefore:

∠DAE = 11x - 1 = ∠AFD = 7x + 9.

Therefore, setting them equal:

11x - 1 = 7x + 9  
Subtract 7x: 4x - 1 = 9  
Add 1: 4x = 10  
Divide by 4: x = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Wait, but 2.5 isn't among the answer choices. However, the answer choices are integers. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, hold on. The problem states that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1)). Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))). So ∠DAE = ∠AFD. And since ∠DAF = ∠AFD (from the equation Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))), then ∠DAF = ∠AFD. So ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9. Therefore, ∠DAE = ∠AFD = 7x + 9. But ∠DAE is also equal to 11x - 1. Hence:

7x + 9 = 11x - 1  
Subtract 7x: 9 = 4x -1  
Add 1: 10 = 4x  
x = 10/4 = 2.5. 

Hmm, same result. But this is not an integer. But answer choices are A. 11, B. 12, C. 13, D. 14. So none of these are 2.5. So either my reasoning is wrong, or perhaps there's more to consider. Let me check if I misinterpreted the angle notations.

Wait, maybe I got the angle names wrong. Let me re-examine the angle definitions:

The first angle is Angle(D,A,F) which is ∠DAF. Second angle is Angle(A,F,D) which is ∠AFD. So the equation says ∠DAF = ∠AFD. So that's correct. Then, another equation says MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), i.e., ∠DAE = ∠AFD. So ∠DAE = ∠AFD = ∠DAF. Therefore, ∠DAE = ∠DAF. Which would imply that ∠DAE and ∠DAF are equal. But how does that happen? If points E and F are arranged such that when looking from point A, the angles between DA and AE, and DA and AF are equal. That could suggest that lines AE and AF make equal angles with DA, implying that maybe AE and AF are symmetric with respect to DA, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. For example, considering triangle ADE and ADF. But perhaps there are other relations due to the parallel lines. 

Since GD || AE and GD || HB, so AE is parallel to HB. Also, HC || AF. Let me see if there are any transversal lines intersecting these parallels, forming congruent angles. 

For instance, if GD || AE, then any transversal crossing them would create corresponding angles. Suppose line AD intersects GD and AE. Wait, point D is part of line GD (since line GD connects G and D). So line GD is parallel to AE. So line AD is a transversal cutting GD and AE. Therefore, the angles formed at D and A would be related. Specifically, angle between GD and AD at D would correspond to angle between AE and AD at A. 

Similarly, since HC || AF, and line AH might be a transversal? Not sure. Let me try to formalize this.

Let me consider line GD || AE. So line GD is parallel to line AE. Let me imagine line AE going from A to E, and line GD going from G to D. If there's a transversal that cuts these lines, for example, line AD. So line AD starts at A and goes to D. Since GD is parallel to AE, then the angle between AD and GD at D should be equal to the angle between AD and AE at A. 

So angle between AD and GD at D is equal to angle between AD and AE at A. Let me denote this. Let's call angle at D between GD and AD as ∠GDA, which would correspond to angle at A between AD and AE, which is ∠DAE. Therefore, ∠GDA = ∠DAE. 

But ∠GDA is part of triangle GDA? Or maybe part of another triangle. Also, since line GD is parallel to AE, and line HC is parallel to AF. Maybe there are similar triangles or other angle relations.

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and HC || AF, maybe there are parallelograms or other figures. 

But let me get back to the previous equations. We had ∠DAE = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, and ∠DAE is also 11x - 1. So solving gives x=2.5. But since the answer choices don't include 2.5, maybe I missed something else. Perhaps there's another equation involving y that relates to x? Let me check the other equations.

We also have MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)) = Sub(Mul(7,y), 4). So ∠ADE = 7y - 4. And MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,B)) = Add(Mul(2,y), 5). So ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

Now, perhaps there are other angle relationships. Let's consider triangle ADE. In triangle ADE, we have angles at A (∠DAE = 11x - 1), at D (∠ADE = 7y - 4), and at E (∠AED). The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:

∠DAE + ∠ADE + ∠AED = 180°  
(11x - 1) + (7y - 4) + ∠AED = 180  
Which simplifies to: 11x + 7y - 5 + ∠AED = 180  
So ∠AED = 185 - 11x - 7y. 

But I'm not sure how this helps yet. Let me think about other angles. 

Also, since line AE is parallel to GD, and line AD is a transversal, so ∠GDA = ∠DAE (as per earlier thought). ∠GDA is part of triangle AGD? Or maybe triangle GDA. Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line HC || AF. 

Wait, line HC is parallel to AF. Let me consider line HC and AF. If there's a transversal cutting them, say line AH. If line AH intersects HC and AF, then angles formed would be equal. But without knowing the exact positions of points, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the straight lines and using the fact that angles around a point sum up to 180° or 360°. 

Looking at point A, we have several angles. At point A, there are angles involving lines AE, AF, and possibly others. From earlier, we know that ∠DAE = 11x - 1, and ∠DAF = 7x + 9. Also, there's angle EAB = 2y + 5. Are these angles adjacent? For example, if lines AE and AF are on different sides of AD, then maybe ∠EAB is adjacent to ∠DAE or something else. 

Wait, let me consider the full picture. Point A has multiple lines emanating from it: AE, AF, and maybe others. The angles mentioned involve lines AD, AE, AF, etc. 

Assuming that lines AE and AF are on different sides of AD, but without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. However, perhaps we can relate angles around point A. 

Suppose that at point A, the angles around it sum up to 360°, but unless we know the exact arrangement, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, if lines AE and AF are on the same side of AD, then the angles ∠DAE and ∠DAF might add up to something. 

Wait, suppose that lines AE and AF are on opposite sides of AD. For example, if AD is a vertical line, and AE goes to the left, AF goes to the right. Then ∠DAE and ∠DAF would be on opposite sides. But without knowing, it's hard. However, given that there are other angles mentioned, like ∠EAB, which involves point B, which is connected to H via line HB, which is parallel to GD and AE. 

This seems too vague. Let me try to think differently. Since we have two expressions involving x and y, and maybe we can form another equation relating x and y.

Earlier, we had from ∠DAE = 11x - 1 and ∠DAF = 7x + 9, leading to 11x - 1 = 7x + 9 → x = 2.5. But since that leads to non-integer x, and answer choices are integers, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))). So ∠DAF = ∠AFD. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))). So ∠DAE = ∠AFD. Thus, ∠DAE = ∠DAF. Therefore, ∠DAE = ∠DAF. This suggests that ∠DAE and ∠DAF are equal. Therefore, the angles between DA and AE, and between DA and AF are equal. So that would mean that lines AE and AF make equal angles with DA, implying that AF and AE are symmetric with respect to DA. So, maybe AF and AE are reflections over DA? Or maybe AF is the reflection of AE? 

If that's the case, then maybe there's a relationship between the other angles. Also, since GD is parallel to AE and AF, and HC is parallel to AF. 

Wait, if GD || AE, and HC || AF, then GD || AE || HC || AF? No, because GD || AE and HC || AF, but not necessarily that GD is parallel to HC or anything else. 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and HC || AF, maybe there are some similar triangles or something. 

But let me go back. If ∠DAE = ∠DAF, then the angles at A between DA and AE and between DA and AF are equal. So, that suggests that AF and AE are symmetric with respect to DA. So, if I imagine DA as a mirror, then AF and AE are symmetric images. Therefore, points E and F are placed symmetrically with respect to DA. 

In that case, maybe triangle AEF is isoceles? Or maybe there's some relation between angles at E and F. 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line AD intersects GD and AE, then ∠GDA = ∠DAE (as previously thought). So ∠GDA = ∠DAE = 11x - 1. Now, what is ∠GDA? It's the angle at D between GD and DA. 

Also, since GD is parallel to AE, and line DH (assuming H is somewhere) may be a transversal. Wait, but I don't know where H is located. However, line HB is parallel to GD. So line HB is parallel to GD, which is parallel to AE. So HB || AE. 

So line HB is parallel to AE, and line HB connects points H and B. So if I can find some angles related to HB and AE, maybe there are corresponding angles. 

Also, line HC is parallel to AF. So line HC || AF. 

Let me consider triangle AFD. Earlier, we had ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9. So triangle AFD is isosceles with AD = FD. 

Also, in triangle ADE, we have ∠DAE = 11x - 1, and ∠ADE = 7y - 4. If we can express ∠AED in terms of x and y, and find another equation relating x and y, perhaps from another angle. 

But how? Let me think about other parts of the diagram. 

At point A, we have angle EAB = 2y + 5. So that's the angle between EA and AB. Since HB is parallel to AE, and assuming line AB is connected to point B, which is on line HB. So line HB is parallel to AE. So, if I consider line AB and line HB, which is parallel to AE, then maybe there's a relationship between angles involving AB and HB. 

For example, if we consider line AB and line HB, since HB is parallel to AE, then the angle between AB and HB would correspond to the angle between AB and AE. 

Wait, but line HB is parallel to AE. So if we take line AB and HB, which is parallel to AE, then the angle between AB and HB is equal to the angle between AB and AE. 

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of it as a transversal. If HB is parallel to AE, then line AB acts as a transversal. So the angle between AB and HB at point B would be equal to the angle between AB and AE at point A. 

Wait, but point B is on line HB, so angle at B between HB and BA would correspond to angle at A between AE and AB. 

So, ∠HBA = ∠EAB. Because they are alternate interior angles if HB || AE and transversal AB. 

So ∠HBA = ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

But what is ∠HBA? It's the angle at B between HB and BA. 

However, without knowing more about the rest of the diagram, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, considering that line HC is parallel to AF. So line HC || AF. Let me assume that point C is somewhere such that line HC is drawn. 

Maybe there's a way to relate angles involving HC and AF with other parts of the diagram. 

But this seems too vague. Let me return to the equations. 

We have two equations from before:

From ∠DAE = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, and ∠DAE = 11x - 1, leading to x = 2.5. But since that's not possible, perhaps there's another equation involving y that allows us to find x? 

Let me think about triangle ADE. As earlier, ∠DAE + ∠ADE + ∠AED = 180. 

∠DAE = 11x - 1  
∠ADE = 7y - 4  
∠AED = ?

But if we can find ∠AED in terms of other angles, maybe through parallel lines. 

Since GD || AE, and line ED intersects them. Wait, line ED would be a transversal. So ∠GDE corresponds to ∠DEA? Or something like that. 

Wait, ∠GDE is at point D between GD and DE. Since GD || AE, then ∠GDE is equal to ∠DEA (alternate interior angles). 

Thus, ∠GDE = ∠DEA. 

But ∠GDE is part of triangle GDE, and ∠DEA is part of triangle DEA. 

But I don't know much about triangle GDE. However, if I can relate ∠GDE to other angles. 

Alternatively, since ∠GDE = ∠DEA, and ∠DEA is part of triangle ADE. 

But ∠DEA is ∠AED, which we denoted earlier as 185 - 11x - 7y. 

So ∠GDE = ∠AED = 185 - 11x - 7y. 

But what is ∠GDE? It's the angle at D between GD and DE. 

But line GD is parallel to AE, and line DE is... Well, line DE connects D to E. So if we consider line DE and GD, which is parallel to AE, then ∠GDE is equal to ∠DEA. 

But I still don't see how this helps unless I can find another expression for ∠GDE. 

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle AFD. Since ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, and ∠ADF is the third angle. 

In triangle AFD, angles sum to 180°, so:

∠DAF + ∠AFD + ∠ADF = 180  
So 2*(7x + 9) + ∠ADF = 180  
Thus, ∠ADF = 180 - 14x - 18 = 162 - 14x. 

But what is ∠ADF? It's the angle at D between AD and DF. 

But DF is part of line DF. How does this relate to other parts of the diagram? 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line DF might intersect GD or AE. 

Wait, line DF connects D to F. If GD is parallel to AE, then line DF could be a transversal. So, if we consider line DF intersecting GD and AE. 

But without knowing where F is located relative to GD and AE, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since HC || AF, and HC connects H to C. Maybe there's a relation between HC and other lines. 

This seems too vague. Let me try to think of other angles. 

We also have the angle ∠AED from earlier, which is 185 - 11x - 7y. And from the parallel lines, ∠GDE = ∠AED. 

But if I can find another expression for ∠GDE. 

Alternatively, considering triangle DGF or something. 

Wait, since GD is parallel to AE, and line DF intersects both GD and AE. Let me consider that. 

Line DF intersects GD at D and intersects AE at some point. Wait, AE is a line from A to E. If line DF intersects AE at some point, but I don't know where. 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line DF is a transversal, then the angle between GD and DF at D is equal to the angle between AE and DF at the intersection point. 

But again, without knowing where DF intersects AE, it's unclear. 

Perhaps I need to find another equation involving y. 

We have ∠ADE = 7y - 4. Also, ∠ADE is part of triangle ADE. And ∠ADE is also related to other angles through the parallel lines. 

Since GD || AE, and line AD is a transversal, ∠GDA = ∠DAE = 11x - 1. 

As mentioned earlier, ∠GDA is the angle at D between GD and DA. 

What is ∠GDA? It's part of triangle GDA. 

But if I consider line GD and DA, and line GD is parallel to AE, then ∠GDA = ∠DAE = 11x - 1. 

Now, in triangle GDA, the angles are ∠GDA = 11x - 1, ∠DGA, and ∠AGD. Wait, but I don't know about the other angles. 

Alternatively, if I can relate ∠GDA to ∠ADE. 

∠ADE is at point D between A and E. So ∠ADE is part of line DE. If I can relate ∠GDA and ∠ADE. 

If line DE passes through D, then ∠ADE and ∠GDA are adjacent angles at point D, forming a linear pair if DE is a straight line extending from GD. 

Wait, if line DE continues past D to meet GD, then ∠GDA and ∠ADE would be supplementary. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think: if line DE extends from D, and GD is a line starting at D, then depending on the direction of DE, ∠GDA and ∠ADE could be adjacent. 

Assume that line DE forms a straight line with GD. Wait, but line GD is from G to D, and line DE is from D to E. So at point D, we have line GD and line DE. So ∠GDA is the angle between GD and DA, while ∠ADE is the angle between DA and DE. 

Wait, so if you're at point D, and you have lines GD, DA, and DE. So ∠GDA is between GD and DA, and ∠ADE is between DA and DE. So together, they form the angle between GD and DE. 

Unless DE is aligned with GD, but that's unlikely. 

But if ∠GDA + ∠ADE = angle between GD and DE. Unless there's a straight line, but without more info, I can't assume that. 

But if I consider that line DE is such that ∠GDA + ∠ADE = 180°, then:

∠GDA + ∠ADE = 180°  
→ (11x - 1) + (7y - 4) = 180  
→ 11x + 7y = 185  

That's one equation. 

Also, we have from earlier that ∠DAF = 7x + 9, and in triangle AFD, ∠ADF = 162 - 14x. 

But what is ∠ADF? It's the angle at D between AD and DF. 

If I can relate ∠ADF to other angles. 

Since line DF connects D to F, and line AF connects A to F. So line DF is part of line AF? No, because F is a separate point. Wait, AF is a line from A to F, and DF connects D to F. So triangle AFD has sides AD, DF, and AF. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since line HC || AF, and line HC connects H to C. If I can find a relationship between ∠ADF and other angles. 

This is getting complicated. Let me recall that we have another equation involving ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

Earlier, I considered that ∠HBA = ∠EAB because of the parallel lines HB || AE. So ∠HBA = ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

Now, ∠HBA is the angle at B between HB and BA. If I can find another expression for ∠HBA, maybe involving other angles. 

For example, if I consider triangle HBA, but without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard. 

Alternatively, since line HB is parallel to AE, and line AB is a transversal, ∠HBA = ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

If I can find another angle related to ∠HBA, maybe from triangle HBA or elsewhere. 

But I'm stuck. Let me go back to the equation I derived earlier: 11x + 7y = 185. 

And from earlier, we had x = 2.5 from the first set of equations, but that led to inconsistency. However, if x is 2.5, then substituting into 11x + 7y = 185 gives:

11*(2.5) + 7y = 185  
27.5 + 7y = 185  
7y = 185 - 27.5 = 157.5  
y = 157.5 / 7 = 22.5 

But then, we have another equation involving ∠ADE = 7y - 4 = 7*22.5 - 4 = 157.5 - 4 = 153.5 degrees. Which is impossible because angles in a triangle cannot exceed 180°, but ∠ADE is part of triangle ADE, and if ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = 11*2.5 - 1 = 27.5 - 1 = 26.5 degrees, and ∠ADE = 153.5 degrees, then the third angle ∠AED = 180 - 26.5 - 153.5 = 0 degrees, which is impossible. So this suggests that my assumption that ∠GDA + ∠ADE = 180° is incorrect. 

Therefore, my earlier approach was flawed. Let me reconsider the relationship between ∠GDA and ∠ADE. 

Perhaps ∠GDA and ∠ADE are not supplementary. Maybe they are part of another angle. 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line DE is a transversal, then ∠GDE = ∠DEA (alternate interior angles). As mentioned earlier, ∠GDE = ∠DEA. 

But ∠DEA is part of triangle ADE. 

So ∠DEA = ∠GDE. 

But what is ∠GDE? It's the angle at D between GD and DE. 

If I can express ∠GDE in terms of other angles. 

Let me consider triangle DGF or something. Wait, if I can relate ∠GDE to other angles. 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and line DA is a transversal, then ∠GDA = ∠DAE = 11x - 1. 

So ∠GDA = 11x - 1. 

Now, at point D, we have angles ∠GDA, ∠ADE, and possibly others. If I can find the sum of these angles. 

Assuming that lines GD, DA, and DE are arranged such that ∠GDA + ∠ADE = some value. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard. 

Wait, if I consider the straight line through D, say, if DE is a continuation of GD, then ∠GDA + ∠ADE would be 180°, but that's an assumption. 

But if DE is not colinear with GD, then it's not. 

Alternatively, since line GD is parallel to AE, and line DE connects D to E, which is on AE. Wait, point E is on AE, which is parallel to GD. So line DE connects D to E, which is on AE. 

So line DE connects D to E, where E is on AE. So line DE is a segment from D to E, where E is on AE. 

So at point D, line DE connects to E on AE. 

So the angle ∠ADE is the angle at D between AD and DE. 

Meanwhile, ∠GDA is the angle at D between GD and DA. 

So these two angles, ∠GDA and ∠ADE, are adjacent at point D, forming a larger angle between GD and DE. 

If I can find this larger angle, it might be related to other parts of the diagram. 

But how? 

Alternatively, since GD || AE, and DE connects D to E on AE, then the line DE is a transversal cutting GD and AE. 

So, at point D, the angle between GD and DE is equal to the angle between AE and DE at point E. 

Wait, since GD || AE, and DE is a transversal, then ∠GDE = ∠DEA (alternate interior angles). 

So ∠GDE = ∠DEA. 

But ∠DEA is part of triangle ADE, which we've already considered. 

So ∠DEA = ∠GDE. 

But ∠GDE is the angle at D between GD and DE. 

So, if I can express ∠GDE in terms of known quantities. 

At point D, we have ∠GDA = 11x - 1 (from earlier), and ∠GDE is part of the angle between GD and DE. 

But ∠GDA is the angle between GD and DA, and ∠GDE is the angle between GD and DE. So the difference between these two angles would be ∠EDA. 

Wait, ∠EDA is the angle at D between ED and DA, which is ∠ADE. 

Wait, yes! Because at point D, the angle between GD and DA is ∠GDA = 11x - 1, and the angle between GD and DE is ∠GDE. The angle between DA and DE is ∠ADE. 

So, depending on the position of DE, ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE or |∠GDA - ∠GDE| = ∠ADE, depending on whether DE is on the same side or opposite side of GD relative to DA. 

But since DE connects D to E, which is on AE, and GD is parallel to AE, the direction of DE would determine the relationship. 

Assuming that DE is on the same side of GD as DA, then ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE. 

Or if DE is on the opposite side, then ∠ADE = |∠GDA - ∠GDE|. 

But since we don't know the exact configuration, let's assume that ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE. 

So:

∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE  
→ (11x - 1) + ∠GDE = 7y - 4  
But ∠GDE = ∠DEA, and ∠DEA = 180 - ∠DAE - ∠ADE = 180 - (11x - 1) - (7y - 4) = 185 - 11x - 7y. 

So substituting:

(11x - 1) + (185 - 11x - 7y) = 7y - 4  
Simplify left side: 11x - 1 + 185 - 11x - 7y = (11x - 11x) + (-1 + 185) - 7y = 184 - 7y  
Set equal to right side: 184 - 7y = 7y - 4  
Combine like terms: 184 + 4 = 7y + 7y  
188 = 14y  
y = 188 / 14 = 94/7 ≈ 13.428...

Now, we have y = 94/7. 

Now, let's revisit the earlier equation from ∠DAE = 11x - 1 and ∠DAF = 7x + 9. 

But earlier, we had ∠DAE = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, leading to 11x - 1 = 7x + 9 → x = 2.5. But if x = 2.5, then y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428. 

But let's check if this makes sense with other equations. 

We also have ∠ADE = 7y - 4 = 7*(94/7) - 4 = 94 - 4 = 90 degrees. 

So ∠ADE = 90°. 

Then, in triangle ADE, ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = 11*(2.5) - 1 = 27.5 - 1 = 26.5°, ∠ADE = 90°, so ∠AED = 180 - 26.5 - 90 = 63.5°. 

Now, ∠AED = 63.5°, which is equal to ∠GDE = 63.5°, as per earlier. 

But this seems okay. 

Now, let's check if there are other equations involving y. 

We also have ∠EAB = 2y + 5. If we can find another expression for ∠EAB, we can solve for y. 

Earlier, I considered that ∠HBA = ∠EAB because of parallel lines HB || AE. So ∠HBA = 2y + 5. 

Now, let's consider triangle HBA. If we can find other angles in this triangle, we can relate them. 

But we don't have enough information. However, since line HB is parallel to AE, and line AB is a transversal, ∠HBA = ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

But what about other angles in triangle HBA? For example, if we know something about ∠HAB or ∠AHB. 

Alternatively, if line HC is parallel to AF, and line HC connects H to C. Maybe there's a way to relate ∠HBA to other angles. 

Alternatively, since HC || AF, and line AH is a transversal, then ∠HAB = ∠FAH (if they are corresponding angles). But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

But let's assume that line HC is parallel to AF, and line AH is a transversal. So ∠HAB = ∠FAH. 

But ∠FAH is part of angle at A. 

At point A, we have angles involving DA, AE, AF. 

If we consider ∠FAH, it would depend on where H is. 

This seems too ambiguous. 

However, since we already have y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428, and x = 2.5, but the answer choices are integers. Let me see if there's another equation that can relate x and y. 

Wait, from the earlier calculation, we have y = 94/7. Let me compute 94 divided by 7: 7*13 = 91, so 94/7 = 13 + 3/7 ≈ 13.428. 

But perhaps there's another equation from the angle at A. 

At point A, we have angles involving DA, AE, AF, and AB. 

We know ∠DAE = 11x - 1, ∠DAF = 7x + 9, and ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

If these angles are adjacent or part of a larger angle, we might be able to relate them. 

For example, if lines AE and AF are on opposite sides of DA, then the total angle around point A would be ∠DAE + ∠DAF + ... but it depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, if ∠EAB is part of ∠DAE or ∠DAF. 

Assuming that line AB is connected to point B, and line HB is parallel to AE. If I consider the angle at A, ∠EAB = 2y + 5, and ∠DAE = 11x - 1. 

If line AB is such that ∠EAB is adjacent to ∠DAE, then ∠EAB + ∠DAE = some angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if line AB is such that ∠EAB is part of a straight line with ∠DAE. 

But this is speculative. 

However, since we have values for x and y from earlier, even though they aren't integers, maybe the question expects rounding or there's a miscalculation. 

But the answer choices are integers. Let me check if there's another equation. 

Wait, from the earlier equations, we have two equations:

1. 11x + 7y = 185 (from ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE, assuming ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE)

2. From ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = ∠AFD = 7x + 9 → 11x - 1 = 7x + 9 → 4x = 10 → x = 2.5

But if x = 2.5, then from equation 1: 11*(2.5) + 7y = 185 → 27.5 + 7y = 185 → 7y = 157.5 → y = 22.5. But earlier, from the other approach, I had y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428. These conflicting results indicate a mistake in assumptions. 

Where did I go wrong? 

Ah, I think the assumption that ∠GDA + ∠GDE = ∠ADE was incorrect. Instead, it should be ∠GDA + ∠ADE = ∠GDE or something else. 

Let me re-express the relationship. 

At point D, we have line GD, DA, and DE. The angle between GD and DA is ∠GDA = 11x - 1. The angle between DA and DE is ∠ADE = 7y - 4. The angle between GD and DE is ∠GDE. Depending on the orientation, these angles could be related as follows: 

If DE is on the same side of DA as GD, then ∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE. 

Otherwise, it could be ∠GDE = |∠GDA - ∠ADE|. 

But since GD || AE, and DE connects D to E on AE, the direction of DE would be such that ∠GDE = ∠DEA (alternate interior angles). 

But ∠DEA = ∠AED = 180 - ∠DAE - ∠ADE = 180 - (11x - 1) - (7y - 4) = 185 - 11x - 7y. 

On the other hand, ∠GDE = ∠DEA = 185 - 11x - 7y. 

But ∠GDE is also equal to ∠GDA + ∠ADE or ∠ADE - ∠GDA, depending on the configuration. 

Assuming that DE is on the same side as GD relative to DA, then ∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE. 

So:

∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE  
→ 185 - 11x - 7y = (11x - 1) + (7y - 4)  
Expand the right side: 11x - 1 + 7y - 4 = 11x + 7y - 5  
So:

185 - 11x - 7y = 11x + 7y - 5  
Bring all terms to left side: 185 - 11x - 7y - 11x - 7y + 5 = 0  
Combine like terms: 190 - 22x - 14y = 0  
So: 22x + 14y = 190  
Divide both sides by 2: 11x + 7y = 95. 

Now, we have this new equation: 11x + 7y = 95. 

Previously, we had from ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, giving x = 2.5. Substituting x = 2.5 into this new equation: 

11*(2.5) + 7y = 95  
27.5 + 7y = 95  
7y = 95 - 27.5 = 67.5  
y = 67.5 / 7 = 9.642857... 

Now, with x = 2.5 and y ≈ 9.6428, let's check if this fits with other equations. 

For example, ∠ADE = 7y - 4 = 7*(67.5/7) - 4 = 67.5 - 4 = 63.5 degrees. 

And ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = 11*2.5 - 1 = 27.5 - 1 = 26.5 degrees. 

Then, in triangle ADE, ∠AED = 180 - 26.5 - 63.5 = 90 degrees. 

So ∠AED = 90°, which matches ∠DEA = 90°, and ∠GDE = 90°. 

Now, let's check if this is consistent with the earlier equation from the parallel lines. 

From the equation 11x + 7y = 95, and x = 2.5, y = 67.5/7 ≈ 9.6428. 

Now, let's check if there are other equations involving y. 

We have ∠EAB = 2y + 5. Let's say we can find another expression for ∠EAB. 

Earlier, I thought that ∠HBA = ∠EAB because of parallel lines HB || AE. So ∠HBA = 2y + 5. 

Now, let's consider triangle HBA. If we can find other angles in this triangle, we might find a relationship. 

But without additional information, it's difficult. However, let's assume that line HB is part of a larger structure. 

Alternatively, since line HC is parallel to AF, and line HC connects H to C, perhaps there's a way to relate ∠HBA to other angles. 

But this is getting too abstract. Let me see if there's another equation involving y. 

We also have ∠ADE = 7y - 4 = 63.5°, as above. 

Is there a way to relate this to other parts? 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle AFD, where ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9 = 7*2.5 + 9 = 17.5 + 9 = 26.5°. 

So in triangle AFD, angles at A and F are both 26.5°, making ∠ADF = 180 - 2*26.5 = 180 - 53 = 127°. 

So ∠ADF = 127°. 

Now, ∠ADF is the angle at D between AD and DF. 

If I can relate this angle to other parts. 

Since GD || AE, and line DF might intersect these lines. 

But without knowing where F is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if line DF is part of some other parallel line. 

But this is too vague. 

However, we now have x = 2.5 and y ≈ 9.6428. But the answer choices are integers. 

This suggests that there might be an error in the assumption that ∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE. 

Let me recheck that. 

If DE is on the same side of DA as GD, then ∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE. 

But if DE is on the opposite side, then ∠GDE = |∠GDA - ∠ADE|. 

But since ∠GDE = ∠DEA, and ∠DEA = 185 - 11x - 7y, and we also have ∠GDE = ∠GDA + ∠ADE or ∠ADE - ∠GDA, depending on the configuration. 

Let me try assuming that ∠GDE = ∠ADE - ∠GDA. 

So:

∠DEA = ∠ADE - ∠GDA  
→ 185 - 11x - 7y = (7y - 4) - (11x - 1)  
Simplify right side: 7y - 4 - 11x + 1 = 7y - 11x - 3  
So:

185 - 11x - 7y = 7y - 11x - 3  
Cancel out -11x from both sides: 185 - 7y = 7y - 3  
Combine terms: 185 + 3 = 7y + 7y  
188 = 14y  
y = 188/14 = 94/7 ≈ 13.428. 

Now, substitute back into the equation from ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = 7x + 9 → x = 2.5. 

So x = 2.5, y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428. 

Now, let's check if this works. 

With x = 2.5, ∠DAE = 11x - 1 = 26.5°, ∠DAF = 7x + 9 = 26.5°, so ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 26.5°, making triangle AFD isosceles with AD = FD. 

∠ADE = 7y - 4 = 7*(94/7) - 4 = 94 - 4 = 90°. 

In triangle ADE, ∠DAE = 26.5°, ∠ADE = 90°, so ∠AED = 180 - 26.5 - 90 = 63.5°, which is equal to ∠DEA = 63.5°, and ∠GDE = 63.5°. 

Now, if ∠GDE = ∠ADE - ∠GDA, then:

∠GDE = ∠ADE - ∠GDA  
→ 63.5 = 90 - (11x - 1)  
→ 63.5 = 90 - (11*2.5 - 1)  
Calculate 11*2.5 = 27.5, so 27.5 - 1 = 26.5.  
Thus, 90 - 26.5 = 63.5, which matches. 

So this assumption is valid. 

Now, with x = 2.5 and y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428, but the answer choices are integers. 

But the question asks for x, and the options are A. 11, B. 12, C. 13, D. 14. 

None of these are 2.5. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the earlier steps, or perhaps the problem assumes that x is an integer, and there's a calculation error. 

Wait, let me double-check the initial equations. 

The problem states:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9))  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1))  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))  
Which means ∠DAE = ∠AFD. 

But ∠AFD is part of triangle AFD, where ∠DAF = ∠AFD = 7x + 9. So ∠DAE = 7x + 9. 

But ∠DAE is also given as 11x - 1. So 7x + 9 = 11x - 1 → 10 = 4x → x = 2.5. 

This is correct. 

But since the answer choices don't include 2.5, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the setup. 

Wait, let me check if the equations were interpreted correctly. 

The first angle is Angle(D,A,F), which is ∠DAF. 
Second angle is Angle(A,F,D), which is ∠AFD. 
Third angle is Angle(D,A,E), which is ∠DAE. 
Fourth angle is Angle(A,D,E), which is ∠ADE. 

Wait, the problem also mentions Angle(A,D,E), which is ∠ADE, and it's equal to Sub(Mul(7,y), 4). So ∠ADE = 7y - 4. 

And Angle(E,A,B) is ∠EAB = 2y + 5. 

But there's also an equation: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))), which is ∠DAF = ∠AFD. 

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))), which is ∠DAE = ∠AFD. 

So ∠DAE = ∠AFD = ∠DAF = 7x + 9. 

But ∠DAE is also 11x - 1. So 7x + 9 = 11x - 1 → x = 10/4 = 2.5. 

This seems correct. 

But since the answer choices are integers, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I missed a constraint. 

Wait, let me check if there's another equation that involves x and y. 

From the earlier calculation, we have 11x + 7y = 95 (from assuming ∠GDE = ∠ADE - ∠GDA). 

With x = 2.5, this gives 11*(2.5) + 7y = 95 → 27.5 + 7y = 95 → 7y = 67.5 → y = 9.6428. 

But there's also the equation from ∠EAB = 2y + 5. Is there a way to relate this to other angles? 

Let me consider the straight line at point A. If line AB is such that it forms a straight line with some other line, or if there are supplementary angles. 

For example, if ∠EAB is part of a straight line with ∠DAE, then ∠EAB + ∠DAE = 180°. 

But that would mean 2y + 5 + 11x - 1 = 180 → 2y + 11x + 4 = 180 → 2y + 11x = 176. 

But with x = 2.5, this would give 2y + 27.5 = 176 → 2y = 148.5 → y = 74.25, which is inconsistent with earlier y = 9.6428. 

So this assumption is invalid. 

Alternatively, if ∠EAB is part of a triangle or another angle. 

Alternatively, if line AB is such that ∠EAB is supplementary to ∠DAF. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Given that all paths lead to x = 2.5, and the answer choices are integers, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem setup or the answer choices are incorrect. 

However, since the user requires choosing from the given options, and assuming that the correct answer is the closest integer, but 2.5 is closer to 2 or 3, neither of which are in the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the equations. Let me re-express the equations. 

Wait, let me re-express the equation from ∠DAE = ∠AFD = 7x + 9, and ∠DAE = 11x - 1. So:

7x + 9 = 11x - 1  
Subtract 7x: 9 = 4x - 1  
Add 1: 10 = 4x  
x = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5. 

Correct. 

But maybe the problem meant that MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), and MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), but perhaps I misread the angle notations. 

Wait, let me recheck the angle notations. 

The problem says:

Angle(D,A,F) is ∠DAF.  
Angle(A,F,D) is ∠AFD.  
Angle(D,A,E) is ∠DAE.  
Angle(A,D,E) is ∠ADE.  
Angle(E,A,B) is ∠EAB. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, the equations are correct. 

Given this, and no other equations, it seems x = 2.5 is the only solution. But since the answer choices are integers, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps the correct answer is not listed. 

However, since the user insists on choosing from the options, and assuming that the correct answer is close to 2.5, but none of the options are near, this suggests a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again for any possible misinterpretation. 

The problem says: 

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

Wait, the last line says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))), which is ∠DAF = ∠AFD. 

But earlier, we also have Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D))), so ∠DAE = ∠AFD. 

So, ∠DAF = ∠AFD = ∠DAE. 

Wait, this means ∠DAF = ∠DAE, which implies that ∠DAF = ∠DAE. 

But ∠DAF is the angle at A between D and F, and ∠DAE is the angle at A between D and E. So this implies that points F and E are such that AF and AE make the same angle with AD. This would mean that AF and AE are symmetric with respect to AD, or that F and E are on the same line, but that's not possible unless F=E, which is likely not the case. 

Wait, this suggests that ∠DAF = ∠DAE, so the angles at A between DA and AF, and DA and AE are equal. This implies that AF and AE are symmetric with respect to DA, or that they are the same line, which is not possible. 

Wait, this indicates a contradiction unless AF and AE are the same line, which would mean F and E are the same point, but that's not indicated. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or in my interpretation. 

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement. 

It says: 

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

So, the first equation: ∠DAF = 7x + 9.

Second: ∠DAE = 11x - 1.

Third: ∠DAE = ∠AFD.

Fourth: ∠DAF = ∠AFD.

So, from fourth, ∠DAF = ∠AFD, and from third, ∠DAE = ∠AFD. Therefore, ∠DAF = ∠DAE. 

So, ∠DAF = ∠DAE. 

This implies that ∠DAF = ∠DAE, which means that points F and E are such that lines AF and AE make equal angles with DA at point A. 

This suggests that AF and AE are symmetrical with respect to DA. 

So, if I imagine DA as a vertical line, then AF and AE are on opposite sides of DA, making equal angles. 

In this case, the total angle between AF and AE would be 2 * ∠DAF. 

But this might relate to other angles in the diagram. 

However, this still doesn't resolve the issue with x = 2.5. 

Given that, and since the answer choices are integers, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But since the user requires selecting from the options, and assuming that there's a calculation error, let me check if I misread the equations. 

Wait, let me recheck the equations:

The problem says: 

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), Add(Mul(7,x), 9))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), Sub(Mul(11,x), 1))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,F)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)))

So, the first equation: ∠DAF = 7x + 9.

Second: ∠DAE = 11x - 1.

Third: ∠DAE = ∠AFD.

Fourth: ∠DAF = ∠AFD.

So, from fourth, ∠DAF = ∠AFD, and from third, ∠DAE = ∠AFD, hence ∠DAF = ∠DAE. 

So, ∠DAF = ∠DAE = 7x + 9 = 11x - 1. 

Solving 7x + 9 = 11x - 1 → 10 = 4x → x = 2.5. 

This is correct. 

But since the answer choices are integers, perhaps the problem intended to have ∠DAF = ∠AFD and ∠DAE = ∠AFD, but there's a typo in the equations. For example, if the second equation was ∠DAE = 11x + 1 instead of 11x - 1, then:

7x + 9 = 11x + 1 → 8 = 4x → x = 2. But 2 is not in the options. 

Or if it was 11x + 1 = 7x + 9 → 4x = 8 → x = 2. Still not in options. 

Alternatively, if the first equation was 7x - 9 instead of 7x + 9, then:

7x - 9 = 11x - 1 → -4x = 8 → x = -2. No. 

Alternatively, if the second equation was 11x + 1, and the first was 7x - 9, then 7x - 9 = 11x + 1 → -4x = 10 → x = -2.5. 

No. 

Alternatively, if the first equation was 7x + 9 = 11x + 1, then 4x = 8 → x = 2. 

Still not in options. 

Alternatively, if the first equation was 7x + 9 = 11x + 1, and the second was 11x - 1, but this is speculation. 

Given that, and since the user requires an answer, perhaps the correct answer is 10/4 = 2.5, and the closest option is not available. But since the options are A. 11, B. 12, C. 13, D. 14, and 2.5 is closest to 2 or 3, but none are present. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the correct answer is 10/4 = 2.5, but since it's not an option, the closest is none. 

But since the user requires selection, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck everything once more. 

Wait, let me think: if x = 2.5, then 7x + 9 = 17.5 + 9 = 26.5. And 11x - 1 = 27.5 - 1 = 26.5. So this is correct. 

But if the problem had a different equation, like the measure of ∠DAF = 7x + 9, and ∠DAE = 11x - 1, and ∠DAF = ∠DAE, then x = 2.5. 

But since this is not an option, and the options are integers, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or the answer is not listed. 

However, since the user requires selecting an option, and assuming that there's a miscalculation, let me consider that perhaps the equations were meant to have different coefficients. For example, if the first equation was 7x + 9 = 11x - 1, leading to x = 10/4 = 2.5, but if the actual equation was 7x + 9 = 11x + 1, then x = 8/4 = 2. Still not in options. 

Alternatively, if the second equation was 11x + 1, and the first was 7x + 9, then x = 2.5, but no. 

Given that, and since the user requires an answer, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since I must choose, and assuming that there's a calculation error in the problem, I'll go with the closest option, but this is uncertain. 

However, given that in the calculation with y = 94/7 ≈ 13.428, and if there's another equation involving y, perhaps from ∠EAB = 2y + 5 and another angle. 

Let me assume that ∠EAB is part of a triangle or supplementary angle. 

For example, if ∠EAB + ∠DAE = 180°, then:

2y + 5 + 11x - 1 = 180  
2y + 11x + 4 = 180  
2y + 11x = 176  

With x = 2.5, this gives 2y + 27.5 = 176 → 2y = 148.5 → y = 74.25. 

But this doesn't help. 

Alternatively, if ∠EAB is part of a triangle with other angles.
