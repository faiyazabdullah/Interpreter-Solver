MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given points and lines. There's a circle O with several points on it: A, B, C, E, F. Points A, B, C, E, F are all on the circle. Then there are various lines connecting these points, like AB, BE, EF, CF, AC, DA (wait, point D isn't mentioned as lying on the circle? Wait, the constraints say Point(D,A) and Line(D,A)? Hmm, maybe D is another point connected via line DA and DC? But since D isn't specified to lie on the circle, maybe it's inside or outside?

But maybe that's not important right now. The key things are arcs FE measures 118 degrees, arc AB measures 108 degrees, angle EGB is 52 degrees, and angle EFB is 30 degrees. Need to find measure of arc CF.

First, let me recall some circle theorems. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, angles formed by intersecting chords can relate to arcs. Also, when two chords intersect, the measure of the angle is half the sum or difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, here we have angle EGB which is 52 degrees. Let me see where point G is. It says IntersectAt(Line(C,E), Line(B,F), Line(G), Point(G)). So lines CE and BF intersect at point G. Therefore, angle EGB is formed at point G by lines GE and GB. Since G is the intersection of CE and BF, so triangle EGB exists.

Given that angle EGB is 52 degrees. Also, angle EFB is 30 degrees. Let me note that angle EFB is at point F between points E, F, B. Since F is on the circle, angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. Wait, but angle at F, so the intercepted arc would be arc EB. Wait, no: the vertex is at F, so the angle EFB intercepts arc EB. Wait, but depending on where the points are placed.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for angles formed by intersecting chords: when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Similarly, if the angle is outside, it's half the difference.

So angle EGB is formed by two chords: GE and GB. Since point G is inside the circle (as it's the intersection of CE and BF), then angle EGB should be equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Let me confirm:

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle EGB intercepts arcs... Let's think. The angle at G is formed by lines GE and GB. So the intercepted arcs would be arc EB and arc something else?

Wait, more precisely, when two chords intersect at G, the angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords intersect at G, forming vertical angles, then each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Let me check:

Suppose chords CE and BF intersect at G. Then angle EGB intercepts arcs EB and CF? Or maybe arcs EC and FB? Wait, perhaps I need to consider the arcs intercepted by the pairs of angles created by the intersecting chords.

Let me recall the exact theorem: If two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, then the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle EGB intercepts arcs that are opposite. So angle EGB intercepts arc EB and arc FC? Wait, maybe.

Let me draw mentally. Suppose chords CE and BF intersect at G. Then angle EGB is formed by segments GE and GB. The intercepted arcs would be arc EB (between E and B) and arc CF (between C and F). Wait, how does that work?

Alternatively, the angle is formed by two chords: GE and GB. The intercepted arcs would be those arcs that are opposite the angle. So angle EGB intercepts arc EB (the arc from E to B not containing F and C?) and arc... Maybe the other arc that's intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles. Alternatively, perhaps it's the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. When two chords intersect, they create vertical angles. Each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For instance, angle EGB and angle FGC (if there is such a point) are vertical angles. So angle EGB is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two chords. 

The intercepted arcs would be arc EB (from E to B) and arc CF (from C to F). Because chord CE connects C to E, and chord BF connects B to F. Their intersection creates angles whose intercepted arcs are EB and CF. So according to the theorem, angle EGB = ½ (arc EB + arc CF).

We know angle EGB is 52 degrees. So 52 = ½ (arc EB + arc CF). Therefore, arc EB + arc CF = 104 degrees. That's equation one.

Now, also given that angle EFB is 30 degrees. Let's analyze angle EFB. This is an inscribed angle at point F, with vertex at F, so it intercepts arc EB. Because angle EFB is formed by points E-F-B. So the inscribed angle at F intercepts arc EB. Therefore, measure of angle EFB is half the measure of arc EB. Hence, arc EB = 2 * angle EFB = 2*30=60 degrees. 

Therefore, substituting back into the first equation: arc EB + arc CF = 104. Since arc EB is 60, then arc CF = 104 - 60 = 44 degrees. Therefore, the measure of arc CF is 44 degrees, which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is angle EFB indeed intercepting arc EB? Let me make sure. In a circle, an inscribed angle formed by points E, F, B would intercept the arc that's opposite the angle, i.e., arc EB. Yes, because the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc is EB. So yes, angle EFB is half of arc EB. Therefore, arc EB is 60 degrees. Then angle EGB is half the sum of arc EB and arc CF, so 52 = ½(60 + x) => 104 = 60 +x => x=44. So arc CF is 44 degrees, so answer is B.

But wait, let me check again if there's any possibility that arc EB could be the other arc, the major arc instead of minor arc. However, since angle EFB is 30 degrees, which is acute, the intercepted arc must be less than 180 degrees. Because if the arc were greater than 180, the inscribed angle would be obtuse. So arc EB is 60 degrees, which is minor arc. So that seems okay.

Also, check if there are any other relationships. For example, arc AB is given as 108 degrees. Maybe that's part of another calculation. But the question is about arc CF. However, maybe there's another way to verify.

Another thing: Let's check if there are other arcs involved. For example, arc FE is given as 118 degrees. Arc AB is 108 degrees. Are there any relations between these arcs?

But since the problem only asks for arc CF, and through the previous reasoning, we arrived at 44 degrees, which is option B. So unless there's a mistake in my application of the intersecting chords angle theorem.

Wait, let me re-examine the intersecting chords theorem. The measure of the angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle EGB is formed by chords GE and GB. These chords are parts of CE and BF. So the intercepted arcs would be arc EB and arc CF. So yes, angle EGB is half the sum of those two arcs. Thus, our calculation holds.

Hence, arc CF is 44 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{CF} $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying appropriate theorems related to circles and angles.

---

### Step 1: Understand Given Information

- **Points** $ A, B, C, E, F $ all lie on circle $ O $.
- Several **chords** connect these points: $ AB, BE, EF, CF, AC, DA, DC, CE, BF $.
- **Arc Measures**:
  - $ \widehat{FE} = 118^\circ $
  - $ \widehat{AB} = 108^\circ $
- **Angles**:
  - $ \angle EGB = 52^\circ $
  - $ \angle EFB = 30^\circ $

- **Key Intersection**: Lines $ CE $ and $ BF $ intersect at point $ G $.  
  - Therefore, $ \angle EGB $ is formed by intersecting chords at point $ G $.

---

### Step 2: Use the Intersecting Chords Theorem

When **two chords intersect inside a circle**, the angle formed is **half the sum** of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Here, since $ G $ lies inside the circle, and $ \angle EGB $ is formed by chords $ GE $ and $ GB $, the angle measures:

$$
\angle EGB = \frac{1}{2} (\text{arc } \widehat{EB} + \text{arc } \widehat{CF})
$$

Substitute known value:

$$
52 = \frac{1}{2} (\widehat{EB} + \widehat{CF}) \Rightarrow \widehat{EB} + \widehat{CF} = 104^\circ \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine Measure of Arc $ \widehat{EB} $

We're told that:

$$
\angle EFB = 30^\circ
$$

Since $ \angle EFB $ is an **inscribed angle** intercepting arc $ \widehat{EB} $, we use the property:

$$
\text{Inscribed Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Intercepted Arc} 
\Rightarrow \widehat{EB} = 2 \times 30 = 60^\circ \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ \widehat{CF} $

From Equation (1):

$$
\widehat{EB} + \widehat{CF} = 104^\circ
\Rightarrow 60 + \widehat{CF} = 104
\Rightarrow \widehat{CF} = 44^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

Thus, the measure of arc $ \widehat{CF} $ is:

$$
\boxed{44^\circ}
$$

This matches **Answer Choice B**.

---

**Final Answer:** B
