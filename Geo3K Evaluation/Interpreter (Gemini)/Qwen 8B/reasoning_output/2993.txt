====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a circle O with several points on it: A, B, C, D, E, F. The lines EC and AB are diameters. Also, there are angles at point O: angle BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA, and they're all congruent. We need to find the measure of arc AC, denoted as m∠AC. Wait, no, actually, the question says m widehat AC, which I think means the measure of arc AC. 

First, since EC and AB are diameters, that means points E and C are endpoints of one diameter, and A and B are endpoints of another diameter. Since diameters pass through the center O, so O is the midpoint of both EC and AB. That tells me that OA, OB, OC, OE, OF are all radii of the circle. 

Now, looking at the angles mentioned: ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≡ ∠EOF ≡ ∠FOA. Let me visualize this. Points B, D, E, F are arranged around the circle such that each adjacent pair forms equal angles at the center O. So starting from B, going to D, then E, then F, then back to A? Wait, but how do these points connect?

Wait, the angles given are ∠BO D (so between points B, O, D), ∠DOE (points D, O, E), ∠EOF (E, O, F), and ∠FOA (F, O, A). All these central angles are congruent. Since there are four angles here, each of them being equal, and they add up to the full circle? Wait, but maybe not. Because depending on how the points are placed.

But first, since AB and EC are diameters, points A and B are opposite each other on the circle, same with E and C. But then, the angles between these points are given. Let's consider the entire circle as 360 degrees. If there are four congruent central angles, each would be 360 divided by 4, which is 90 degrees. Wait, but that might not account for all the arcs.

Wait, but maybe those four angles make up part of the circle. Let me think again. Let's imagine the points:

Starting from point B, moving through D, then E, then F, then A. Each adjacent pair connected by those angles. So the central angles between B and D is one angle, D to E another, E to F another, F to A another. And all of these are congruent. Therefore, each of these four angles is equal. So total of 4 angles adding up to some portion of the circle. But since they are all congruent, each would be equal. However, I need to check if these angles cover the entire circle or just part of it.

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are parts of the circle. For example, if you start from point B, go through D, E, F, and then to A, then the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA would correspond to those angles. But also, since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B would be 180 degrees. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so arc from E to C is 180 degrees.

Wait, but how does this fit together? Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's assume that AB and EC are two diameters intersecting at O. Now, points D, E, F are somewhere else on the circle. Given that angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are congruent. So starting from B, the angle between BO and OD is equal to the angle between DO and OE, etc., until FOA. So each of these angles is equal. Let me denote each of these angles as x. Then, since there are four angles, their sum would be 4x. But what is the total measure of these angles?

If these angles are adjacent and form a complete circle, then 4x = 360°, so x = 90°. But wait, that would mean each angle is 90°, making the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA each corresponding to 90°, hence each arc is a quarter-circle. However, we also know that AB is a diameter. Let's see.

Let me consider the positions. Starting from point B, moving along the circle through D, E, F, and ending at A. Since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°. But according to the angles given, the arc from F to A is one of the angles, which is x. Then, the arc from A to B would consist of arc AF plus arc FB. Wait, but where is point F located? Maybe I need to track the order of points.

Alternatively, since AB is a diameter, points A and B are directly opposite each other. Similarly, points E and C are directly opposite. Now, considering the angles given: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. These angles are at the center O. So, the points D, E, F are arranged such that when you look from O, each consecutive angle is equal.

So suppose we start at point B, then move to D, then E, then F, then to A. So the arc from B to D is covered by angle BOD, which is x. Then from D to E is angle DOE (another x), then E to F (x), then F to A (x). Thus, the total of these four arcs BD + DE + EF + FA equals the arc from B to A passing through D, E, F. However, since AB is a diameter, the arc BA (the major arc or minor arc?) depends on direction. But since AB is a diameter, the straight line between A and B passes through O, so the minor arc AB is 180°, while the major arc AB would be 180° as well because it's a circle. Wait, no, the arc AB can be considered as either 180° or the rest. Wait, but in the context of the circle, if you take the arc from B to A passing through D, E, F, that would be the major arc if the points D, E, F are on the opposite side of the circle from AB.

Wait, but if AB is a diameter, then the arc from B to A could be 180°, but if the path goes through D, E, F, then that arc would be more than 180°, unless the points are arranged differently.

Alternatively, maybe the points D, E, F are arranged such that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA each correspond to x, and adding up to something. But since AB is a diameter, the arc from B to A is 180°, so the sum of arcs BD + DE + EF + FA must equal 180°, assuming that the path from B to A through D, E, F is the minor arc. However, if that's the case, then 4x = 180°, so x=45°, meaning each angle is 45°, and thus each arc is 45°, leading to the total of 4*45=180°.

But then, what about the other diameter EC? Since EC is also a diameter, so arc EC is 180°. How does that relate to the other points?

Alternatively, perhaps the points D, E, F are arranged such that they are related to the diameter EC. Let me think. Since EC is a diameter, points E and C are endpoints. Suppose that from E, moving through D, then to O? No, O is the center. Wait, maybe the points D, E, F are positioned such that each angle corresponds to steps between different diameters.

Alternatively, since there are four equal central angles (∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA), each equal to x, then total of 4x. But since these angles are part of the circle, the sum of these angles would be less than or equal to 360°. But without knowing how they are arranged, it's tricky. However, we also have that AB and EC are diameters, so maybe there are relationships between these angles and the positions of the points.

Another thought: since AB and EC are diameters, then points A and B are separated by 180°, and points E and C are separated by 180°. Now, considering the angles between these points. Let me try to assign coordinates to make it easier.

Assume the circle has radius r, but maybe unit circle for simplicity. Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Let me set coordinate system such that AB is horizontal. Let me say point A is at (-1, 0) and point B at (1, 0), since AB is a diameter. Then EC is another diameter; let me define points E and C. Let me pick coordinates for E and C. But maybe it's better to use angles.

Since AB is a diameter, the angle subtended by AB at the center is 180°, as it's a straight line. Now, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all congruent. Let me think about the positions of D, E, F.

Suppose starting from point B, moving counterclockwise around the circle, we encounter D, then E, then F, then A. Each of these steps corresponds to an angle of x degrees at the center. Therefore, the arc from B to D is x degrees, D to E is x, E to F is x, F to A is x. Hence, total arc from B to A via D, E, F is 4x degrees. But since AB is a diameter, the arc BA is 180°, so 4x = 180°, so x = 45°. Therefore, each of these angles is 45°, which makes sense.

Therefore, each of the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA is 45°, so each arc is 45°, and thus the arc from B to D is 45°, D to E is 45°, E to F is 45°, and F to A is 45°, totaling 180°, which matches the diameter AB.

Now, we need to find the measure of arc AC. Let's determine where point C is. Since EC is a diameter, point C is diametrically opposite to E. Let me think about where point E is. From earlier, we had points B → D → E → F → A. So point E is after D, and before F. Since each step is 45°, starting from B, which is at (1,0) in our coordinate system.

Wait, in our setup, AB is a diameter from A(-1,0) to B(1,0). Let me assume that the movement from B is counterclockwise. So starting at B(1,0), moving 45° counterclockwise gets us to point D. Then another 45° to E, then another 45° to F, then another 45° to A(-1,0). Wait, but if we start at B(1,0), moving 45° counterclockwise would place D at angle 45° from B. But since B is at angle 0° (if we consider standard position), moving counterclockwise 45° would put D at angle 45°, then E at 90°, F at 135°, and finally A would be at 180°, which is indeed the position of A(-1,0). Wait, but in this case, point A is at 180°, which is consistent with AB being a diameter. 

Wait, but then where is point C? Since EC is a diameter. Point E is at 90°, so its diametrically opposite point C would be at 90° + 180° = 270°, which is pointing downward. So point C is at (0,-1). 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc AC. Point A is at (-1,0) and point C is at (0,-1). Let me calculate the arc length between A and C. In terms of degrees, the central angle between A and C. 

Point A is at 180°, point C is at 270°, so the difference is 270° - 180° = 90°, but since we're dealing with arcs on a circle, the smaller arc AC would be the minimum between clockwise and counterclockwise. From A(-1,0) to C(0,-1): going counterclockwise from A(180°) to C(270°) is 90°, whereas going the other way is 270°, so the smaller arc is 90°, so measure of arc AC is 90°, which would make the answer B. But let me verify this carefully.

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me check again. 

If point E is at 90°, then point C is at 90° + 180° = 270°, yes. Point A is at 180°, so the arc from A to C is from 180° to 270°, which is 90°, so the measure is 90°, which would be answer B. However, let me confirm if my assumption about the positions is correct.

Wait, but what if the points D, E, F are arranged differently? Like, maybe not starting from B. But given that the angles are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, etc., the sequence starts at B, moves through D, E, F, then ends at A. So the arc from B to A through D, E, F is 4x = 180°, so each x is 45°, as above. Hence, point E is at 45° + 45° = 90°, so point E is at 90°, making point C at 270°, as above. 

Thus, arc AC spans from A(180°) to C(270°), which is 90°, so the answer is 90°, which is option B. But let me check if there's another possibility. 

Wait, but the problem states that angle AOC is a right angle. Wait, in the problem statement, there's a condition: RightAngle(Angle(A,O,C)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,C)),90). Wait, Angle(A,O,C) is the angle at O between points A and C. Which is exactly the central angle for arc AC. So if that angle is 90°, then the measure of arc AC is 90°, which confirms that the answer is B. 

Wait, but the problem mentions that angle AOC is a right angle. So that directly gives that arc AC measures 90°, so answer B. So regardless of the previous steps, that condition ensures that arc AC is 90°. Therefore, the answer is B. 

But let me double-check. Since angle AOC is formed by points A-O-C, and since O is the center, this is a central angle. Therefore, the measure of angle AOC is equal to the measure of arc AC. Since the problem states that angle AOC is a right angle (90°), then arc AC must be 90°, so answer B. 

Therefore, even without considering the other points, this direct relation gives the answer. However, the initial analysis with points D, E, F also led to the same conclusion. So both approaches concur. 

Hence, the measure of arc AC is 90°, so the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{AC} $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying key principles of circle geometry.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- Circle $ \odot O $ contains points $ A, B, C, D, E, F $ on its circumference.
- Lines $ EC $ and $ AB $ are diameters of the circle. This implies:
  - $ E $ and $ C $ are endpoints of one diameter.
  - $ A $ and $ B $ are endpoints of the second diameter.
- Central angles $ \angle BOD, \angle DOE, \angle EOF, \angle FOA $ are all **congruent**.
- It’s given that $ \angle AOC $ is a **right angle**, i.e., $ \angle AOC = 90^\circ $.
- The goal is to find the **measure of arc $ \widehat{AC} $**.

---

### **Step 2: Key Observations and Implications**

#### **Central Angles and Arcs**
- The measure of a **central angle** is numerically **equal** to the degree measure of its intercepted arc.
- Since $ \angle AOC = 90^\circ $, the arc $ \widehat{AC} $ must also measure $ 90^\circ $. This follows directly from the property of central angles.

#### **Verification Using Other Constraints**
The fact that $ \angle BOD = \angle DOE = \angle EOF = \angle FOA $ and that these angles sum up to a portion of the circle helps validate the symmetry and placement of points around the circle. However, this information serves more as background and is not necessary to compute the final answer directly.

---

### **Conclusion**

Given that $ \angle AOC $ is a right angle (90°), and since it is a central angle, the arc it intercepts — arc $ \widehat{AC} $ — must also measure $ 90^\circ $.

$$
\text{Measure of } \widehat{AC} = \angle AOC = 90^\circ
$$

### **Final Answer: B**

\boxed{\text{B}}
