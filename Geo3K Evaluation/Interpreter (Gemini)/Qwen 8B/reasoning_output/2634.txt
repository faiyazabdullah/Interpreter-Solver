MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So we have triangle RST with points X, Y, Z. The question is asking for the length of ST. Let me start by recalling the given information and the properties related to midsegments in triangles.

First, the problem states that XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST. Wait, but midsegments are segments connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle. Also, it mentions that X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST. Because there's a statement saying IsMidpointOf(Point(X), Line(R,S)) which means X is the midpoint of RS. Similarly, Y is the midpoint of RT (from IsMidpointOf(Point(Y), Line(R,T))), and Z is the midpoint of ST (from IsMidpointOf(Point(Z), Line(S,T))). 

Now, since XY and XZ are midsegments, they should be parallel to the opposite sides. The problem also says Parallel(Line(X,Z), Line(R,T)) and Parallel(Line(X,Y), Line(S,T)). That makes sense because midsegments are parallel to the third side of the triangle. For example, XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, so it should be parallel to ST. But wait, according to the given, Line(XY) is parallel to Line(ST). Similarly, Line(XZ) is parallel to Line(RT).

Also, there's a quadrilateral XYTZ mentioned as a parallelogram. Since XY and XZ are midsegments, and their endpoints are connected via Y and Z, maybe forming a parallelogram? Let me think about that. If XY is parallel to ST and XZ is parallel to RT, then the quadrilateral XYTZ would have opposite sides parallel, making it a parallelogram. Which matches the given Parallelogram(X,Y,T,Z).

But the main thing here is to find the length of ST. Let's note down the given lengths:

- The length of XY is 7 units. Since XY is a midsegment, it should be half the length of the side it's parallel to. From the problem, XY is parallel to ST, so ST should be twice the length of XY. Therefore, ST = 2 * 7 = 14. But let me check if that's consistent with other given information.

Wait, another part says Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)), HalfOf(LengthOf(Line(S,T)))). Oh, that directly tells us that XY is half of ST. So since XY is 7, then ST is 14. Then the answer should be C, 14. But let me verify again with other data to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Another given is that the length of RT is 13. Also, Y is the midpoint of RT, so RY equals YT. Therefore, YT = 13 / 2 = 6.5. However, the problem also states Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Y)), LengthOf(Line(Y,T))). Well, that's just confirming that Y is the midpoint, so RY equals YT, which is already known.

Additionally, there's something about the angle at X being 124 degrees. But maybe that's extra info not needed for finding ST. Since the key relation is between XY and ST through the midsegment theorem. 

So, based on the midsegment theorem, the length of a midsegment is half the length of the corresponding side. Since XY is a midsegment parallel to ST, its length is half of ST. Given that XY is 7, then ST must be 14. Hence, the answer is C. 

Let me cross-check with other possible relations. The problem also mentions that XZ is a midsegment parallel to RT. Since XZ is parallel to RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST, then XZ's length should be half of RT. Given that RT is 13, then XZ should be 13/2 = 6.5. But the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)), HalfOf(LengthOf(Line(R,T)))), which matches. So that checks out. 

Therefore, ST is indeed twice XY, which is 7*2=14. So answer C.
