MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D with several lines connecting them. The goal is to find the value of x based on the given constraints. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, let's list out all the given conditions:

1. Points A, B, C, D are defined.
2. Lines AD, DC, AB, BC, BD are drawn.
3. Point D lies on line AC (since PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,C))).
4. Length of AD = 6x + 2.
5. Length of DC = 8.
6. Length of AB = 9x - 2.
7. Length of BC = 10.
8. Line BD bisects angle ABC.
9. Triangles ABC and DBC are formed.
10. The ratio of AD/DC equals the ratio of AB/BC.

Wait, the last point says RatioOf(AD, DC) equals RatioOf(AB, BC). That seems like a key equation here. Since ratios are equal, maybe using similar triangles or the Angle Bisector Theorem?

Let me recall the Angle Bisector Theorem. If a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. In this case, BD bisects angle ABC, so according to the theorem, the ratio of AB to BC should be equal to the ratio of AD to DC. Wait, but hold on. Wait, BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC. But where does it intersect? It intersects AC at D, right? Because D is on AC.

So, applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle ABC with angle bisector BD, which meets AC at D. Then the theorem states that AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem says AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, actually, the formula is AB / BC = AD / DC? Wait, let me check again. 

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments, then the ratio of the lengths of these segments is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. So in triangle ABC, with angle bisector from B to D on AC, then AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, noâ€”wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem says AB / BC = AD / DC? Or is it AB / BC = AD / DC?

Wait, more accurately, the theorem states that AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, the angle bisector splits the opposite side into parts proportional to the adjacent sides. So, for example, in triangle ABC, if BD is the bisector of angle B, meeting AC at D, then AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no, I think it's AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Actually, the correct statement is AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Let me check. Suppose BD is the bisector of angle B. Then AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confused. Let me think again. 

In triangle ABC, angle bisector from B hits AC at D. Then AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that AB / BC = AD / DC? Or is it AB / BC = AD / DC? No, the correct formula is AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, the theorem says that the ratio of the two segments created on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides. So, AD / DC = AB / BC. Yes, that's right. So AD / DC = AB / BC.

But in our problem, they state that the ratio of AD/DC equals the ratio of AB/BC. Which matches this. Therefore, according to the Angle Bisector Theorem, since BD bisects angle ABC, then AD/DC = AB/BC. Therefore, this condition is already satisfied by the theorem. However, we also have specific numerical values given for the lengths. Let's write down those equations.

Given:

AD = 6x + 2

DC = 8

AB = 9x - 2

BC = 10

Therefore, according to the ratio equality:

AD / DC = AB / BC

Plugging in the expressions:

(6x + 2)/8 = (9x - 2)/10

Now, solving this equation for x.

Cross-multiplying:

10*(6x + 2) = 8*(9x - 2)

Compute left side: 60x + 20

Right side: 72x - 16

Set equal:

60x + 20 = 72x - 16

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

60x - 72x = -16 - 20

-12x = -36

Divide both sides by -12:

x = (-36)/(-12) = 3

So x equals 3. Now checking the answer choices, option A is 3. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me verify once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation.

We had AD/DC = AB/BC. AD is 6x+2, DC is 8. AB is 9x-2, BC is 10. So yes, (6x+2)/8 = (9x-2)/10. Cross multiply gives 10*(6x+2)=8*(9x-2). Which leads to 60x + 20 = 72x -16. Subtract 60x: 20 = 12x -16. Add 16: 36=12x => x=3. Correct.

Therefore, x is 3, which corresponds to option A. So Final Answer: A.
