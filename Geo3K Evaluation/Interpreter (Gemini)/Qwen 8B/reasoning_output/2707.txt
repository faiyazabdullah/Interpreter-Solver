MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the area of the parallelogram ABCD given all these constraints. Let me start by recalling some properties of parallelograms and right triangles since there's mention of right angles and altitudes here.

First, the problem states that ABCD is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the area can be calculated as base times height. The question mentions that Line AB is the base, so maybe we need to find its length and the corresponding height.

Looking at the constraints:

- It says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)),15). Since CD is opposite to AB in the parallelogram, then AB should also be 15 units long because opposite sides are equal. Wait, but another constraint says Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),13). BC is one of the sides, so AD would also be 13. But then they also say Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),LengthOf(Line(C,D))). Oh, so AB equals CD, which is already given as 15. So AB is 15. That makes sense for the base.

Now, the area of the parallelogram would be base (AB) multiplied by the height. However, we need to figure out the height. The problem mentions that CE is perpendicular to AB, and E lies on AB. Also, triangle CEB is a right triangle with the right angle at E. Let me visualize this.

So point E is somewhere on line AB such that CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, CE is the height of the parallelogram relative to base AB. Because in a parallelogram, the area is base * height, and here CE is the height since it's perpendicular to AB.

But wait, how do we find the length of CE? They give us some lengths related to triangle CEB. Specifically, they state that Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)),5). So BE = 5. Also, the Pythagorean theorem is applied here: SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C))) equals Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,E)))). 

Let me write that down. Given that BC = 13, BE = 5, and CE is the unknown. So according to the equation:

BC² = BE² + CE²  
Which translates to:  
13² = 5² + CE²  
Calculating that:  
169 = 25 + CE²  
Subtracting 25 from both sides:  
CE² = 144  
Taking square root: CE = 12. 

Therefore, CE is 12 units long. Since CE is the height of the parallelogram with respect to base AB, the area would be AB * CE = 15 * 12 = 180. 

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

The problem also mentions that CE is an altitude of the parallelogram. So yes, CE is indeed the height. And AB is the base. So multiplying them gives the area. So 15*12=180. Which matches option B. 

But let me confirm once more. The problem states that IsAltitudeOf(Line(C,E), Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)), meaning that CE is the altitude. So that confirms that CE is the height. Thus, the area is base AB (which is 15) times height CE (which is 12), giving 180. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, could there be something else? For example, maybe I misread the length of AB? Let me check again.

They said Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)),15). Since CD is equal to AB in a parallelogram, AB is 15. Then BC is 13, which is the side adjacent to the base AB. Then using the right triangle CEB with BE=5, BC=13, so CE=12. All checks out. So area is 15*12=180. Therefore, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area of the parallelogram $ABCD$, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and constraints provided in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Structure**

We are told that $ABCD$ is a **parallelogram**, which means:

- Opposite sides are **equal** and **parallel**:  
  $$
  AB \parallel CD,\quad AD \parallel BC,\quad AB = CD,\quad AD = BC
  $$

- Diagonals bisect each other.
- The **area** of a parallelogram is given by:
  $$
  \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
  $$

From the problem:

- $AB = CD = 15$ (given directly).
- $BC = AD = 13$ (also given directly).
- Point $E$ lies on line segment $AB$, and $\overline{CE}$ is **perpendicular** to $AB$. This implies that $\overline{CE}$ is the **altitude** of the parallelogram with respect to base $AB$.

Thus, the **height** of the parallelogram is the length of $\overline{CE}$, and the **base** is $AB = 15$.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Right Triangle to Find Height**

We are told that triangle $\triangle CEB$ is a **right triangle** with:

- $\angle CEB = 90^\circ$
- $BE = 5$
- $BC = 13$

This forms a classic **Pythagorean triple**. Using the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 \\
\Rightarrow 13^2 = 5^2 + CE^2 \\
\Rightarrow 169 = 25 + CE^2 \\
\Rightarrow CE^2 = 144 \\
\Rightarrow CE = \sqrt{144} = 12
$$

So, the **height** of the parallelogram (i.e., the length of $\overline{CE}$) is **12**.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Area of the Parallelogram**

Using the formula for the area of a parallelogram:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = AB \times CE = 15 \times 12 = 180
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All constraints align with this calculation. The key steps were recognizing that $\overline{CE}$ is the height due to being perpendicular to the base $AB$, and applying the Pythagorean Theorem to find that height.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
