MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a circle C with points J, K, and L on it. There's also point H and line HB that's tangent to the circle at point J. Then there's line KE intersecting the circle at J, and angle KJI measures 116 degrees. Also, triangleCJK is isosceles because CJ and CK are radii of the circle, so they're equal. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Since CJ and CK are radii, triangle CJK is isosceles with CJ = CK. That means angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, but which angles? In triangle CJK, sides CJ and CK are equal, so the base angles would be at J and K. Wait, noâ€”wait, the vertex is at C. So the two equal sides are CJ and CK, making the base JK. Therefore, the base angles at J and K should be equal. But wait, the problem says that angle (C,J,K) equals 180 minus measure of angle (K,J,I). Let me parse that again.

The problem states: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,J,K)), Sub(180, MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,I)))). So angle at C, between J and K, equals 180 minus angle KJI, which is given as 116 degrees. So angle CJK (at point C) is 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Wait, but angle CJK is part of triangle CJK. Let me think.

Wait, angle (C,J,K) is angle at point J? No, the notation is confusing. Wait, angle(C,J,K) would be the angle at point J between points C, J, K. Wait, no. The middle letter is the vertex. So angle(C,J,K) is the angle at point J, with segments JC and JK. Similarly, angle(K,J,I) is the angle at point J between points K, J, I. So angle KJI is at point J. 

But then, according to the given constraint, angle(C,J,K) equals 180 minus measure of angle(K,J,I). So angle at J in triangle CJK is equal to 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Wait, but triangle CJK has angles at C, J, and K. Since CJ and CK are radii, triangle CJK is isosceles with legs CJ and CK. Therefore, angles at J and K are equal. Wait, but according to the problem, angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, right? Because it's written as angle(C,J,K), so vertex at J. So that angle is 64 degrees. Then since triangle CJK is isosceles with CJ=CK, the angles at J and K are equal. Wait, but angle at J is 64 degrees, so angle at K is also 64 degrees. Then angle at C is 180 - 64 - 64 = 52 degrees. Wait, but earlier we thought angle(C,J,K) was 64 degrees. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me clarify:

- Triangle CJK has vertices C, J, K. Sides CJ and CK are radii, hence equal. Therefore, triangle CJK is isosceles with base JK and equal sides CJ and CK. Therefore, the base angles at J and K are equal. Wait, but angle at J is angle CJK? Or angle at J is angleCJK?

Wait, the angle notation: angle(C,J,K) is the angle at point J between points C, J, K. So that's angle at J. So angle CJK is at point J. So in triangle CJK, angles at J and K are equal. Therefore, angle at J (angle CJK) equals angle at K (angle CJK?) Wait, no. Wait, triangle CJK has three angles: at C, at J, and at K. Since CJ = CK, the angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, side opposite angle at J is CK, and side opposite angle at K is CJ. Since CJ = CK, then angles opposite them are equal. Therefore, angle at K (opposite CJ) equals angle at J (opposite CK). So angle at J equals angle at K. 

So if angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, which is equal to angle at K. And angle(C,J,K) is given as 180 - angle(KJI) = 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Therefore, angle at J (which is angle CJK) is 64 degrees, angle at K is also 64 degrees, and angle at C is 180 - 64 - 64 = 52 degrees. 

Now, moving on. We need to find the measure of arc JKL. The problem mentions Arc(J,K,L) and Arc(J,K). Also, there's a relation that measure of arc(J,K) equals measure of angle(J,C,K). Wait, angle(J,C,K) would be the angle at point C between points J and K. Which is the same as angle at C in triangle CJK, which we just found as 52 degrees. So measure of arc JK is 52 degrees? Wait, but arcs correspond to central angles. So the measure of arc JK is equal to the central angle subtended by it, which is angle JCK. Which is angle at C, which is 52 degrees. So arc JK is 52 degrees. 

Then, the problem says that measure of arc(J,K,L) is equal to 360 minus measure of arc(J,K). Wait, the exact wording is: Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(J,K,L)), Sub(360,MeasureOf(Arc(J,K)))). So arc JKL is 360 - arc JK. Therefore, measure of arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees? Wait, but that seems too big. Wait, but the question asks for measure of arc JKL, which is arc from J through K to L. Wait, but arc JKL could be major arc or minor arc depending on the position of L. However, since points J, K, L are on the circle, and arc(J,K,L) is mentioned, which probably implies the arc starting at J, passing through K, then ending at L. So that would be the major arc JKL if L is positioned such that the arc spans more than half the circle. 

But according to the given formula, measure of arc(J,K,L) equals 360 minus measure of arc(J,K). If arc(J,K) is 52 degrees, then arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But that seems like a large value. However, the answer choices include up to 298, so perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the arc JKL refers to something else. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of arc JKL is referring to the arc from J to L passing through K. But if arc JK is 52 degrees, then adding another arc KL... Wait, but we don't know measure of arc KL yet. Wait, but the problem gives that arc(J,K,L) equals 360 minus arc(J,K). So that suggests that arc JKL is the entire circumference minus arc JK. Therefore, arc JKL would be 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But 308 isn't among the answer choices directly. Wait, answer choices are A.116, B.184, C.232, D.298. Hmm. 308 isn't listed. Maybe my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating arc JK. Let me re-examine. The problem states Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(J,K)), MeasureOf(Angle(J,C,K))). So arc JK is equal to angle at C, which is angle JCK. Earlier, we said angle at C is 52 degrees, so arc JK is 52 degrees. Then arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 360 - 52 = 308. But none of the answer choices are 308. Wait, but maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe angle(J,C,K) is not the central angle. Wait, angle at C between points J and K. Yes, that's the central angle, so yes, arc JK is equal to that angle. So that's correct. So arc JK is 52 degrees. Then arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308. But answer choices don't have 308. Wait, unless there's a misunderstanding about the arc. Perhaps arc JKL is not the whole circumference minus arc JK, but instead, arc JL? Wait, but the notation Arc(J,K,L) usually denotes the arc from J to L passing through K. So that would be the major arc JKL. But if the total circumference is 360 degrees, and arc JK is 52 degrees, then arc JKL would be the rest of the circle. But 360 - 52 = 308. But again, that's not an option. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of angle at C?

Let me go back. The problem states that angle(C,J,K) equals 180 - angle(KJI). Given that angle(KJI) is 116 degrees, so angle(C,J,K) is 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. But angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, which in triangle CJK. Wait, earlier conclusion that triangle CJK has angles at J and K equal. Wait, but if angle at J is 64 degrees, then angle at K is also 64 degrees, and angle at C is 180 - 64 - 64 = 52 degrees. So angle at C is 52 degrees. Therefore, arc JK is 52 degrees. Then arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308. But answer options don't have that. So maybe I messed up the relationship between angles and arcs.

Wait, perhaps angle KJI is related to the inscribed angle. Wait, angle KJI is formed by lines KJ and IJ. Wait, but where is point I located? The problem mentions angle(K,J,I), so point I is somewhere. But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell. However, since line KE intersects the circle at J, and line HB is tangent at J. Maybe point I is on line KE? Not sure. But given that angle KJI is 116 degrees, which might be an inscribed angle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle KJI relates to the arc. For example, if angle KJI is an inscribed angle, then its measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but angle KJI is at point J, which is on the circle. So if it's an inscribed angle, then it intercepts arc from K to I. Wait, but we don't know where point I is. However, since line KE passes through J, maybe point I is on line KE extended? This is getting complicated.

Wait, but the key thing is that angle(C,J,K) equals 180 - angle(KJI). So angle at J in triangle CJK is 64 degrees. Then, using triangle angle sum, angle at C is 52 degrees. Hence, arc JK is 52 degrees. Then arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But since answer choices don't have that, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says "Arc(J,K,L)" which might mean the arc from J to L passing through K. But if arc JK is 52 degrees, then arc JKL would be arc JK + arc KL. But if arc JKL is supposed to be 360 - arc JK, that would imply arc KL is 360 - 52 - arc JK? Wait, no. If arc JKL is the entire circumference minus arc JK, then arc JKL would be 360 - arc JK. But that would only make sense if arc JKL is the major arc from J to L via K. But without knowing where L is, it's ambiguous. However, the problem says PointLiesOnCircle(L,Circle(C)), so L is another point on the circle. 

Additionally, there's a tangent line HB at J, and line KE intersects the circle at J. Maybe L is the intersection of line KE with the circle again? Wait, line KE intersects the circle at J, so maybe it intersects at another point? But the problem says IntersectAt(Line(H,B),Circle(C),Line(K,E),Point(J)), meaning that line HB and line KE intersect at point J. So line KE passes through J, and since it's a secant, it might intersect the circle at another point. Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnCircle(L,Circle(C)), so L is another point on the circle. Maybe line KE intersects the circle at J and another point, say, L? Wait, but the problem states that Line(K,E) intersects the circle at J, but does it pass through another point? Or is E outside the circle?

This is getting too vague without a diagram. Let me try focusing on the arc relationships. The problem says measure of arc JK equals measure of angle(J,C,K), which is angle at C, which we found as 52 degrees. Then measure of arc JKL equals 360 - arc JK = 360 - 52 = 308. But answer options don't have 308. Wait, but maybe the arc JKL is not the entire circumference minus arc JK, but rather arc JL? Wait, if arc JKL is from J to L passing through K, then arc JKL would be arc JK plus arc KL. But if arc JK is 52 degrees, and arc KL is something else. But how do we find arc KL?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving angle KJI. Since angle KJI is 116 degrees, which is an angle formed by chords KJ and IJ. If point I is outside the circle, then angle KJI would be an external angle, which is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think. If I is outside the circle, and lines KI and JI are secants or tangents. But since line KE passes through J and I, and J is on the circle, maybe I is outside. So angle KJI is formed by two secants, KI and JI. Then, the measure of angle KJI would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, angle KJI = Â½ (arc KI - arc KJ). Wait, but I don't know where point I is. However, the problem states that angle KJI is 116 degrees. So if I can express this in terms of arcs, maybe we can find something.

Assuming that point I is outside the circle, and angle KJI is formed by secants KI and JI, then angle KJI = Â½ (measure of arc KI - measure of arc KJ). Wait, but I need to confirm this theorem. The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So yes, angle KJI would be Â½(arc KI - arc KJ). Given that angle KJI is 116 degrees, then:

116 = Â½(arc KI - arc KJ)

Multiply both sides by 2: 232 = arc KI - arc KJ.

But arc KJ is 52 degrees, as established before. So:

arc KI - 52 = 232 => arc KI = 232 + 52 = 284 degrees.

But arc KI is the arc from K to I passing through the opposite side of the circle. However, since the circle is 360 degrees, arc KI could be either the minor arc or major arc. But if point I is outside, then arc KI is likely the major arc. But how does this relate to our previous information?

Alternatively, maybe arc KI is the arc from K to I passing through J, but since J is on the circle, arc KJI would be arc KJ + arc JI. But this is getting too tangled.

Wait, but we also have point L on the circle. The problem mentions Arc(J,K,L), which might be arc JKL, which is the arc from J to L passing through K. If that's the case, then arc JKL would be arc JK + arc KL. But we don't know arc KL. However, earlier, we had that measure of arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 308 degrees. But that contradicts unless arc KL is 308 - arc JK = 308 - 52 = 256 degrees. But that's possible. However, without knowing where L is, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe arc JKL refers to the arc from J to L passing through K, which would be the major arc. If arc JK is 52 degrees, then the rest of the circle is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But if arc JKL includes arc JK and arc KL, then arc JKL would be 52 + arc KL. But if arc JKL is 308 degrees, then arc KL would be 308 - 52 = 256 degrees. But again, not sure.

Wait, going back to the problem's last part: Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(J,K,L)), Sub(360,MeasureOf(Arc(J,K)))). So arc JKL equals 360 - arc JK. Therefore, if arc JK is 52 degrees, then arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But 308 is not among the options. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in assuming that arc JK is 52 degrees. Let me double-check.

Earlier, we said that angle(J,C,K) is equal to the measure of arc JK. Angle(J,C,K) is angle at point C between points J and K. Since CJ and CK are radii, this angle is the central angle for arc JK. Thus, arc JK should indeed be equal to that angle, which we found as 52 degrees. So arc JK is 52 degrees. Hence, arc JKL is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But answer choices are A.116, B.184, C.232, D.298. Closest to 308 is D.298. But why isn't it exactly 308? Is there a calculation error?

Wait, maybe the measure of arc JK isn't 52 degrees. Let me recheck the steps. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,J,K)), Sub(180, MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,I)))). Angle(K,J,I) is given as 116 degrees, so angle(C,J,K) is 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Now, angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, which is part of triangle CJK. Earlier, I assumed that triangle CJK has angles at J and K equal, but is that correct?

Wait, triangle CJK has sides CJ and CK as radii, so CJ = CK. Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle with equal sides CJ and CK. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal. The angle opposite CJ is angle at K, and the angle opposite CK is angle at J. So angle at K equals angle at J. Wait, but earlier I considered angle(C,J,K) as angle at J. So angle at J (angle CJK) equals angle at K (angle CJK?), no. Wait, angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, which would be angle between JC and JK. Wait, maybe I got confused with the notation.

Let me clarify the notation for angles in triangles. In triangle CJK, the vertices are C, J, K. So angle at J is âˆ CJK, angle at K is âˆ CKJ, and angle at C is âˆ JCK. 

Given that CJ = CK, the triangle is isosceles with equal sides CJ and CK. Therefore, angles opposite these sides are equal. Side CJ is opposite angle K (âˆ CKJ), and side CK is opposite angle J (âˆ CJK). Therefore, âˆ CKJ = âˆ CJK. So angle at J (âˆ CJK) equals angle at K (âˆ CKJ). 

But according to the problem, angle(C,J,K) is âˆ CJK, which is the angle at J. So that angle is equal to angle at K. And angle at C is âˆ JCK, which is the third angle. 

We were told that angle(C,J,K) equals 180 - angle(K,J,I). So âˆ CJK = 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. Therefore, angle at J (âˆ CJK) is 64 degrees, and angle at K (âˆ CKJ) is also 64 degrees. Then angle at C (âˆ JCK) is 180 - 64 - 64 = 52 degrees. 

Therefore, central angle âˆ JCK is 52 degrees, so arc JK measures 52 degrees. 

Now, the problem says that measure of arc JKL is 360 - arc JK. So 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But since 308 isn't an option, maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, maybe arc JKL is referring to the arc from J to L passing through K, which is the major arc. But if the total circle is 360 degrees, and arc JK is 52 degrees, then the remaining arc from J to K the other way is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But if point L is placed such that arc JKL is that 308 degrees, then that would be the measure. But since answer choices don't have 308, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the arc.

Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which would be arc JK + arc KL. If arc JK is 52 degrees, then we need to find arc KL. How?

If we consider that angle KJI is 116 degrees, which we earlier tried to relate to arcs. Let me revisit that. Assuming point I is outside the circle, angle KJI is formed by two secants: KI and JI. So, angle KJI = Â½(measure of arc KI - measure of arc KJ). We had:

116 = Â½(arc KI - 52) â†’ arc KI = 232 + 52 = 284 degrees.

Arc KI is 284 degrees. Since the full circle is 360, arc KI could be the major arc from K to I. But if arc KI is 284 degrees, then the minor arc KI would be 360 - 284 = 76 degrees. 

But how does this help us with arc JKL? If L is a point on the circle, and arc JKL is related to arc KI? Not sure. Unless point L is the same as point I? But I is not defined as being on the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a connection between arc KL and arc KI. Suppose that line KE passes through J and extends to meet the circle again at point L? Wait, the problem states that line KE intersects the circle at J, implying that it might intersect at another point. If line KE intersects the circle at J and another point, say, L. So L is the second intersection point of line KE with the circle. Then, arc KL would be part of the circle. 

If that's the case, then arc KL would be related to angle KJI. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if line KE passes through J and L, then angle KJI is formed at J by lines KJ and IJ. But if I is on line KE, then angle KJI is formed by KJ and IJ, where I is on line KE. If I is outside the circle, then angle KJI is an external angle. 

But this is getting too speculative. Let me try to use the fact that arc KI is 284 degrees. If arc KI is 284 degrees, then the corresponding chord is KI. But how does this connect to arc JKL? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, maybe arc JKL is the same as arc KI. But arc KI is 284 degrees, which is close to option D.298. But why would arc JKL be 284? 

Wait, if arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, and if point L is the second intersection of line KE with the circle, then arc JKL would be arc JK + arc KL. But we know arc JK is 52 degrees, and we need arc KL. 

If line KE intersects the circle at J and L, then angle KJI is formed at J by KJ and IJ, where I is on line KE. So if I is outside, then angle KJI = Â½(arc KI - arc KJ). As before, arc KI = 284 degrees. Arc KI is the arc from K to I, which passes through the circle. But since I is outside, arc KI would be the arc from K to I that doesn't contain the center. Wait, noâ€”the formula for external angle uses the difference between the intercepted arcs. So arc KI is the arc that's farther away from the external point. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try another approach. The problem asks for measure of arc JKL. If we assume that arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 308, which is not an option, but the closest is D.298. Maybe there's a rounding or miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps arc JK isn't 52 degrees. Let me check again.

Wait, angle at C is 52 degrees, which is the central angle for arc JK. So arc JK is 52 degrees. If arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 308, but maybe the question meant arc JKL as the arc from J to L passing through K, which would be the major arc, but in reality, the measure of arc JKL might be the minor arc? No, because it's specified as arc JKL, implying it goes through K. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc JKL is the measure of the arc from J to L passing through K, which is arc JK + arc KL. If we can find arc KL, then add to arc JK.

To find arc KL, perhaps we can use the fact that line KE passes through J and L (assuming L is the second intersection point). Then, since line KE intersects the circle at J and L, then angle at J, angle KJI, relates to arc KI. Wait, but if I is on line KE, then point I is outside the circle. Let me denote that line KE passes through J and L, with L being another point on the circle. So line KE intersects the circle at J and L. Therefore, angle KJI is formed at J by lines KJ and IJ, where I is on line KE beyond J. So, I is outside the circle. 

In this case, angle KJI is an external angle, so its measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are arc KL (the arc from K to L not containing J) and arc KJ. Wait, no. The formula is angle = Â½ (larger arc - smaller arc). So angle KJI = Â½ (arc KI - arc KJ), where arc KI is the arc from K to I that doesn't contain J, and arc KJ is the arc from K to J. But since I is on line KE, extending past J, arc KI would be the arc from K to I passing through L (since L is on line KE). Wait, this is too vague.

Alternatively, since line KE passes through J and L, then arc KL is the arc from K to L. If we can relate angle KJI to arc KL. 

But I'm not making progress here. Let me return to the original equations. We have arc JK = 52 degrees, and arc JKL = 360 - arc JK = 308. If the closest option is D.298, maybe there's a calculation error. Or perhaps the arc JKL is actually the arc from J to L passing through K, which is arc JL, and arc JL is 360 - arc JK - arc KL? No.

Wait, perhaps the measure of arc JKL is not 360 - arc JK, but 360 - arc JL. But without knowing arc JL, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that arc JK is 52 degrees. Let me reconsider the relationship between angle at C and arc JK. 

Angle at C is âˆ JCK, which is the central angle for arc JK, so it should equal the measure of arc JK. Earlier, we computed âˆ JCK as 52 degrees. But let's verify that again. 

In triangle CJK, angles at J and K are each 64 degrees, angle at C is 180 - 64 - 64 = 52 degrees. Correct. So arc JK is 52 degrees. 

So arc JKL = 360 - 52 = 308 degrees. But since this isn't an option, maybe the actual arc is the minor arc JKL? Wait, but arc JKL passing through K would be the major arc if L is placed such that it's on the opposite side. But if the arc is 308 degrees, that's almost a full circle. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, the highest is 298, which is very close to 308. Maybe there's a calculation mistake. Let me check the angle at C again. 

Angle(C,J,K) is 64 degrees. Wait, but angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, not at C. Wait, no! Wait, angle(C,J,K) is the angle at J. Wait, no! Wait, angle notation: angle(C,J,K) is the angle at J between points C, J, K. So it's angle at J. Earlier, I said that in triangle CJK, angle at J is 64 degrees. But then, angle at C is 52 degrees. 

But maybe I misapplied the angle subtraction. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,J,K)), Sub(180, MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,I)))). So angle(C,J,K) is 180 - 116 = 64 degrees. But angle(C,J,K) is angle at J, which is part of triangle CJK. So in triangle CJK, angle at J is 64 degrees, angle at K is also 64 degrees (because triangle is isosceles), and angle at C is 52 degrees. 

Thus, arc JK is 52 degrees. 

Now, if arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 308 degrees. But since 308 is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D.298, assuming a typo or approximation. But this is risky. Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which is arc JK + arc KL. If arc KL is 246 degrees, then total arc JKL would be 52 + 246 = 298, which matches option D. 

How can we get arc KL? Let's think. If line KE passes through J and L, then arc KL is related to angle at J. Using the external angle formula: angle KJI = Â½ (arc KI - arc KJ). We had arc KI = 284 degrees. But arc KI is the arc from K to I, passing through L (since I is on line KE). But arc KI would be arc KL + arc LJ? Wait, I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, if I is on line KE, then arc KI is the arc from K to I, but since I is outside the circle, arc KI would be the arc that doesn't contain J. Wait, this is too vague. Let me try to calculate arc KL. 

Assume that arc KL is x degrees. Then, if we use the external angle formula: angle KJI = Â½ (arc KI - arc KJ). Arc KI is the arc from K to I, which would be arc KL + arc LJ? No, if I is on line KE, then arc KI would depend on where I is. 

Alternatively, since line KE passes through J and L, and I is on line KE, then arc KL is the arc from K to L, which is part of the circle. If I is outside, then angle KJI = Â½ (arc KL - arc KJ). Wait, no, the formula is angle = Â½ (far arc - near arc). If I is outside, then the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between K and L (not containing J) and the arc between K and J. Wait, but arc between K and J is 52 degrees. 

Wait, if I is outside the circle on line KE, then angle KJI is formed by secants KJ and IJ. The intercepted arcs are arc KJ (52 degrees) and arc KL (if L is the other intersection). Wait, no. The intercepted arcs are the arc between K and L (the arc that doesn't contain J) and the arc between K and J. Wait, but I'm not certain. 

Let me look up the exact formula: the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So if two secants intersect at a point outside the circle, then the angle is Â½ (large arc - small arc). 

In this case, point I is outside the circle, and the two secants are IK and IJ. Wait, no: angle KJI is formed at point J, with segments KJ and IJ. Wait, no, angle at J is between KJ and IJ. So the two secants are KJ and IJ, intersecting at J, which is on the circle. Wait, but if J is on the circle, then one of the secants is tangent at J? No, line HB is tangent at J, but line KE passes through J. 

Wait, if J is on the circle, and line KE passes through J, then line KE is a secant. So angle KJI is formed at J by secant KJ and secant IJ. But since J is on the circle, one of the secants is actually a tangent if IJ is tangent. But the problem states that line HB is tangent at J, but nothing about line IJ. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to visualize. Point J is on the circle. Line KE passes through J, so it's a secant. Point I is somewhere such that angle KJI is formed at J, with one side being KJ (part of line KE) and the other side being IJ. If I is outside the circle, then angle KJI is formed by a secant (KJ) and a secant or tangent (IJ). 

If IJ is a secant, then it would intersect the circle at two points. But since J is already on the circle, if IJ is a secant, it would intersect the circle at J and another point. But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, IJ could be a tangent. If IJ is tangent at J, then angle KJI would be formed by a secant (KJ) and a tangent (IJ). In that case, the measure of angle KJI is Â½ (arc KJ - 0), since the tangent makes a 0-degree arc. But that would give angle KJI = Â½ * arc KJ = Â½ * 52 = 26 degrees, which doesn't match the given 116 degrees. So that can't be. 

Therefore, IJ must be a secant intersecting the circle at J and another point, say M. So angle KJI is formed by secant KJ and secant JM, with I on line JM. Then, the measure of angle KJI would be Â½ (arc KM - arc KJ). Wait, but I don't know where M is. 

This is getting too complex. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, maybe I should accept that arc JKL is 308 degrees, and the closest option is D.298, possibly due to a calculation error in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, let me try calculating the measure of arc JKL using the given relationships. We know arc JK is 52 degrees. If arc JKL is 360 - arc JK = 308, but since that's not an option, maybe the problem wants the measure of arc JL? Let me see. If arc JL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which is arc JK + arc KL. If arc KL is x, then arc JL is 52 + x. But how to find x?

Alternatively, if arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which is the same as arc JL. If we can find arc JL, then that would be the answer. To find arc JL, maybe using the fact that line KE passes through J and L, and angle KJI = 116 degrees. 

Using the external angle formula: angle KJI = Â½ (arc KL - arc KJ). Wait, if IJ is a secant intersecting the circle at J and M, then angle KJI = Â½ (arc KM - arc KJ). But without knowing where M is, it's impossible to determine. 

However, if we assume that point L is the other intersection of line KE with the circle, then arc KL would be the arc from K to L, and angle KJI would involve arc KL and arc KJ. 

If I assume that angle KJI = Â½ (arc KL - arc KJ), then:

116 = Â½ (arc KL - 52)

Multiply both sides by 2: 232 = arc KL - 52 â†’ arc KL = 232 + 52 = 284 degrees. 

Then arc JKL (arc from J to L passing through K) would be arc JK + arc KL = 52 + 284 = 336 degrees. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if arc JKL is arc KL, which is 284 degrees. But 284 is not an option. 

Wait, the answer choices are A.116, B.184, C.232, D.298. 

Wait, if arc KL is 284, and arc JK is 52, then the arc from J to L passing through K is arc JK + arc KL = 52 + 284 = 336, but that's still not matching. 

Alternatively, if arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which is arc JKL = arc JK + arc KL = 52 + 284 = 336, but this is larger than 360, which is impossible. So this suggests an error. 

Maybe I should consider that arc KL is 284 degrees, but since the total circle is 360, arc KL is the major arc from K to L, which is 284, and the minor arc is 76 degrees. If arc JKL is the minor arc JL, then it would be arc JK + arc KL (minor)? No. 

This is really confusing. Given that I'm stuck, and the closest option to 308 is D.298, I'll go with D.298 as the answer, assuming there might be a calculation error or rounding in the problem.
