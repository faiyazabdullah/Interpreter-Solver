MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have several points and lines with certain constraints. The goal is to find the length of TQ, which is given as some expression involving x, and then determine which answer choice matches that value.

First, let me list out all the given information:

- Points R, S, T, Q, A.
- Lines RS, ST, RQ, TQ.
- Angles at S for angles RSQ and TSQ are right angles (since they're marked as RightAngle).
- Also, line SQ is perpendicular to line RT. So, lines SQ and RT are perpendicular.
- The lengths of RS and ST are both 7 units.
- The length of RQ is given as x + 3, and the length of TQ is 2x - 6.
- Additionally, triangles RSQ and TSQ are right triangles, and their hypotenuses RQ and TQ are equal in length. Wait, because it says Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)), LengthOf(Line(T,Q))). So RQ = TQ?

Wait, but RQ is x+3 and TQ is 2x-6. Therefore, setting them equal gives x+3 = 2x-6. Solving that would give x=9? Let me check that again. If x+3 = 2x -6, subtract x from both sides: 3 = x -6 → x=9. Then substituting back into either expression, RQ would be 9+3=12, and TQ would be 2*9 -6=12. So TQ would be 12. But wait, that seems straightforward. However, maybe there's more to it because of the other constraints?

But hold on, the problem mentions that there are two right triangles, RSQ and TSQ. Both are right-angled at S. Because the angles at S are right angles. So triangle RSQ has legs RS and SQ, with hypotenuse RQ. Similarly, triangle TSQ has legs TS and SQ, with hypotenuse TQ. Since RS and TS are both 7 units, and since both triangles are right-angled at S, then the legs for each triangle are RS and SQ for the first triangle, and TS and SQ for the second triangle. 

So, using Pythagoras for both triangles:

For triangle RSQ: RQ² = RS² + SQ² → (x+3)² = 7² + SQ².

For triangle TSQ: TQ² = TS² + SQ² → (2x -6)² = 7² + SQ².

But since both expressions equal SQ², we can set them equal to each other:

(x+3)² - 7² = (2x -6)² - 7².

Subtracting 7² from both sides cancels out, so:

(x+3)^2 = (2x -6)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: x² +6x +9

Right side: 4x² -24x +36

Set equal:

x² +6x +9 = 4x² -24x +36

Bring all terms to left side:

0 = 3x² -30x +27

Divide both sides by 3:

x² -10x +9 = 0

Factor quadratic equation:

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 9 and add up to -10. Those numbers are -1 and -9.

Thus, (x -1)(x -9)=0 → solutions x=1 or x=9.

Now, need to check validity of these solutions. Let's consider x=1:

Then RQ would be 1+3=4, and TQ would be 2*1 -6= -4. But length can't be negative. So x=1 is invalid. Hence, only valid solution is x=9. Therefore, TQ = 2*9 -6 = 12. Which would correspond to option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that just equating RQ and TQ directly gives x=9, leading to TQ=12. But here, solving via Pythagorean theorem also leads to same conclusion. So answer should be C. 12. Let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, since both triangles are right-angled at S, and RS=TS=7. So SQ is common leg. So for both triangles, the hypotenuse is RQ and TQ respectively. Thus, since RQ=TQ, then the hypotenuses are equal. So even without going into equations, perhaps there's another way. For example, since RS=TS, and both triangles share SQ, then if RQ=TQ, then the triangles are congruent? Wait, but they share SQ, but RS=TS, and angle at S is right angle. So by hypotenuse-leg congruence, triangles RSQ and TSQ are congruent. Therefore, RQ=TQ, which is already given. But how does that help us? Well, since RS=TS=7, and SQ is common, then the hypotenuses RQ and TQ must be equal, which is given. So our initial approach was correct.

Therefore, solving x+3=2x-6 gives x=9, hence TQ=2*9-6=12. So answer is C. 12. Therefore, the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying algebraic reasoning based on the given constraints.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are given:

- Two right triangles: $ \triangle RSQ $ and $ \triangle TSQ $, both right-angled at point $ S $.
- The legs of $ \triangle RSQ $ are $ RS = 7 $ and $ SQ $, making $ RQ $ its hypotenuse.
- The legs of $ \triangle TSQ $ are $ TS = 7 $ and $ SQ $, making $ TQ $ its hypotenuse.
- It’s stated that $ RQ = TQ $, meaning the hypotenuses of the two triangles are equal.
- The lengths of the segments are expressed in terms of $ x $:
  - $ RQ = x + 3 $
  - $ TQ = 2x - 6 $

---

### **Step 2: Use Algebra to Solve for $ x $**

Since $ RQ = TQ $, we can set the two expressions equal:

$$
x + 3 = 2x - 6
$$

Solving for $ x $:

$$
x + 3 = 2x - 6 \\
\Rightarrow 3 + 6 = 2x - x \\
\Rightarrow x = 9
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Value of $ TQ $**

Using $ x = 9 $ in the expression for $ TQ $:

$$
TQ = 2x - 6 = 2(9) - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of segment $ TQ $ is therefore $ 12 $. Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 6  
- B. 7  
- C. 12  
- D. 18  

The correct answer is **C**.

**Final Answer: C**
