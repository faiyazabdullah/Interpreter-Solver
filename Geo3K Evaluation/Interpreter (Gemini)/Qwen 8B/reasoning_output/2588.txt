MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have some geometric constraints here. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there are several lines mentioned: Line(A,G), Line(E,D), Line(B,F). Also, it says that Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(E,D). Then there are points A, G, E, D, B, F, C, H. The intersections are at point C where Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) meet, and point H where Line(E,D) and Line(B,F) meet. 

Then there are angles labeled 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. The measures of angle 3 is given as x - 12, and angle 6 is 72 degrees. It also states that the measure of angle 3 equals the measure of angle 6. Wait, hold on. The problem says "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(6)))". But then the question says m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72. So maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I need to reconcile these?

Wait, the problem statement says: "MeasureOf(Angle(3), x - 12)" which probably means that the measure of angle 3 is x - 12. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(6), 72) so measure of angle 6 is 72. And then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))) meaning they are equal? But that would mean x - 12 = 72, leading to x = 84. However, looking at the answer choices, D is 84. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here because the problem might involve more than just setting them equal directly. Maybe there's a reason why those angles are equal based on the diagram?

Let me think again. Since lines AG and ED are parallel, and line BF intersects both of them. So, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, etc. 

So, points C and H are the intersections of BF with AG and ED respectively. Therefore, line BF is a transversal cutting through the two parallel lines AG and ED. That should create several angles. Let me visualize this.

Imagine two horizontal parallel lines AG and ED. Then line BF crosses them at points C and H. So, angle 3 and angle 6 could be corresponding angles or alternate interior angles. Wait, but without seeing the exact diagram, I need to rely on the labels given. The problem mentions angles 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. But since I don't have the diagram, I need to infer their positions based on standard configurations.

Assuming that angle 3 and angle 6 are related through the parallel lines and the transversal BF. If angle 3 is at point C (intersection of AG and BF) and angle 6 is at point H (intersection of ED and BF), then depending on their positions, they might be corresponding or alternate angles. For example, if angle 3 is on one side of BF at point C, and angle 6 is on the same side at point H, then they would be corresponding angles and thus equal. Alternatively, if they are alternate interior angles, they'd still be equal.

But according to the problem, it says that MeasureOf(Angle(3)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(6)). But the problem also gives m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72. Therefore, if they're equal, then x - 12 = 72 → x = 84. Which is option D. But wait, why does the problem mention angle 3 and angle 6? Are they referring to specific angles in the diagram that might not be directly equal?

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 and angle 6 are vertical angles or something else. Wait, but if they are corresponding angles due to the parallel lines, they should be equal. So if that's the case, then yes, equate them. But maybe there's another relationship here. Let me check again.

The problem says "Angle(3)" and "Angle(6)", and "MeasureOf(Angle(3), x - 12)" and "MeasureOf(Angle(6), 72)". Then "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(6)))". So the measure of angle 3 equals the measure of angle 6. Therefore, x - 12 = 72 ⇒ x = 84. Hence, answer D. But let me make sure that angle 3 and angle 6 are indeed equal because of the parallel lines. Because if they are not, then maybe there's another way.

For instance, suppose angle 3 is an alternate interior angle with angle 6. Then they would be equal. If they are corresponding angles, same thing. But if they were supplementary, like consecutive interior angles, then they would add up to 180. However, the problem says they are equal. So unless there's some other condition, but the problem states that they are equal. Therefore, x-12=72 ⇒ x=84. So answer D. But wait, answer D is 84. Let me check the answer choices again:

A. 6  
B. 18  
C. 72  
D. 84  

Yes, D is 84. But maybe there's a trick here. For example, maybe angle 3 and angle 6 aren't directly equal, but there's another relation. Let me think again. Suppose angle 3 is part of triangle or something else. Wait, but given that lines AG || ED, and BF is a transversal. At point C, angle between AG and BF is angle 3. At point H, angle between ED and BF is angle 6. If they are corresponding angles, then yes, equal. But if they are on different sides, maybe they are supplementary? Wait, no. If they are on the same side, they would be consecutive interior angles and sum to 180. But the problem says they are equal. Therefore, they must be corresponding or alternate angles. So equality holds. Thus x-12=72 ⇒ x=84. So answer D. 

But why is there an angle 3 and angle 6? Maybe angle 3 is at point C, and angle 6 is at point H, but maybe they are not the ones directly formed by the transversal. For example, maybe angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 6 is an interior angle? Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem says that the measures are equal, and given the information, the only logical conclusion is that x-12=72. Therefore, x=84. So answer D. 

But wait, sometimes problems can have multiple steps. Let me check once again. For example, if angle 3 and angle 6 are vertical angles, but that seems unlikely because they are on different lines. Or maybe angle 3 and angle 6 are parts of triangles or something. But given that the lines are parallel and BF is a transversal, the most straightforward relationship is that angle 3 and angle 6 are either corresponding or alternate interior angles, hence equal. Therefore, x=84. 

Therefore, the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Information**

We are told that:

- Lines $ \text{AG} $ and $ \text{ED} $ are **parallel**.
- Line $ \text{BF} $ intersects both $ \text{AG} $ at point $ C $, and $ \text{ED} $ at point $ H $.
- This configuration forms **two intersecting transversals**: $ \text{BF} $ cuts across the **parallel lines** $ \text{AG} $ and $ \text{ED} $.

From this setup, we know that:

> When a **transversal** intersects **two parallel lines**, it creates various types of angles—corresponding, alternate interior, and consecutive interior angles—with specific properties:
>
> - **Corresponding angles** are **equal**.
> - **Alternate interior angles** are **equal**.
> - **Consecutive interior angles** are **supplementary** (sum to 180°).

---

### **Step 2: Interpret Angle Labels**

The problem refers to:

- $ m\angle 3 = x - 12 $
- $ m\angle 6 = 72^\circ $
- $ m\angle 3 = m\angle 6 $

This tells us that angles 3 and 6 are **equal** in measure. Based on the geometric configuration, the most likely explanation for this equality is that **angles 3 and 6 are either corresponding or alternate interior angles** created by the intersection of the transversal $ \text{BF} $ with the parallel lines $ \text{AG} $ and $ \text{ED} $. In such cases, **corresponding or alternate interior angles are always equal**.

Thus, the equation becomes:

$$
x - 12 = 72
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x - 12 = 72 \\
x = 72 + 12 \\
x = 84
$$

---

### **Step 4: Match with Answer Choices**

Answer choices are:

- A. 6  
- B. 18  
- C. 72  
- D. 84

Since our calculation yields $ x = 84 $, the correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
