MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a square ABCD inscribed in a circle F. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. The answer choices are 45, 60, 90, or 180 degrees.

First, I need to recall some geometry concepts. When a square is inscribed in a circle, all four vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle should be the intersection point of the diagonals of the square because, in a square, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees and intersect at the midpoint. Wait, but in a square, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other at right angles? No, actually, in a square, the diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, but they intersect at 90 degrees? Let me think again. In a square, the diagonals are congruent and they bisect each other. Each diagonal divides the square into two congruent triangles. Also, the angle between the diagonals is 90 degrees? Wait, no. If you draw both diagonals, they cross each other at the center, forming an 'X'. The angle between them would depend on the specific square. But since all sides are equal and angles are 90 degrees, maybe the angle between the diagonals is 90 degrees?

Wait, actually, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes! Because in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that means that the angle between the diagonals is 90 degrees. Therefore, if we consider the center of the circle (which is also the intersection point of the diagonals), then the lines connecting the center to each vertex (the radii) form certain angles.

But wait, the question mentions central angles. A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle, formed by two radii connecting to points on the circumference. Since the square's vertices are on the circle, each side of the square corresponds to an arc on the circle. The central angle corresponding to each side would be... Well, since the square has four sides, the entire circle is divided into four equal arcs. Therefore, each arc is 360/4 = 90 degrees. Therefore, the central angle corresponding to each side of the square would be 90 degrees. However, wait, the problem says "Find the measure of a central angle." But which central angle? Maybe it refers to the angle between two adjacent vertices as viewed from the center. For example, angle AFB, where F is the center. That would be 90 degrees. Alternatively, maybe there's another angle mentioned in the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement, there are several angle references:

- Angle(C,F,D)
- Angle(D,F,A)
- Angle(A,F,B)
- Angle(B,F,C)

So these are angles at point F (the center). Each of these angles is between two radii connected to consecutive vertices of the square. For instance, angle CFD is the angle between FC and FD. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, those two radii connect to adjacent vertices of the square. Therefore, each of these angles would correspond to the central angles subtended by the sides of the square. Since the square divides the circle into four equal parts, each central angle would be 90 degrees. Hence, each of these angles (like angle CFD, DFA, etc.) would be 90 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to something else. Wait, but the problem says "a central angle," so maybe any of those angles listed here. All of them are 90 degrees. So the answer would be 90 degrees. Then looking at the choices, option C is 90. Therefore, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't another interpretation. Suppose someone thought that the central angle refers to the angle between two non-consecutive vertices. Like, for example, angle AFB would be the angle between FA and FB, which are radii to opposite vertices. Wait, but in that case, the angle would be 180 degrees. But according to the problem's constraints, angle AFB is mentioned. Wait, let me check the problem's angle definitions again.

The problem lists:

Angle(C,F,D)
Angle(D,F,A)
Angle(A,F,B)
Angle(B,F,C)

So each of these is a central angle. Let's take Angle(C,F,D): this is the angle at point F between points C and D. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, points C and D are adjacent vertices. So the arc CD is one side of the square, and the central angle over that arc is 90 degrees. Similarly for the others. So each of these angles is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of a central angle here is 90 degrees. So the answer is C.

Another way to confirm: since the square's vertices divide the circle into four equal arcs, each arc is 90 degrees. Therefore, the central angle for each arc is 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 90 degrees, which is option C.
