MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points and triangles with specific angle measures and some congruence conditions. The goal is to find the measure of angle J. Let me start by jotting down all the given information and then work through it step by step.

First, the points mentioned are J, K, L, M, N. There are triangles involved: Triangle(K,L,N), Triangle(L,M,N), Triangle(J,K,L). Also, there are angles given:

- Measure of Angle(J,L,K) is 25 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(M,L,N) is 20 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(K,L,N) is 18 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(J,K,N) is 130 degrees.

Additionally, two triangles are isosceles: Triangle(K,L,N) and Triangle(L,M,N). Also, line segments KL and LN are congruent (Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N))), and LN and NM are congruent (Congruent(Line(L,N), Line(N,M))). 

So, first, let's focus on triangle KLN since it's isosceles. Given that KL ≅ LN, so sides KL and LN are equal. In triangle KLN, which sides are equal? Since KL and LN are congruent, that means the base is KN, and the two equal sides are KL and LN. Therefore, the base angles at K and N should be equal? Wait, no—wait, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. So if KL ≅ LN, then the angles opposite them would be angles at N and K respectively?

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. In triangle KLN, vertices are K, L, N. The sides KL and LN are congruent. So side KL connects points K and L; side LN connects L and N. So the two equal sides are KL and LN. Therefore, the vertex between these sides is point L. Wait, no. If KL and LN are the two equal sides, then they meet at point L. So the triangle has two equal sides meeting at L, making the apex at L. Therefore, the base is KN, and the two equal sides are KL and LN. Therefore, the base angles are at K and N. Wait, but in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. So angles at K and N would be equal? But wait, the given angles here include angle at K (which is angle JKL?), wait let me check the angles again.

Wait, the angles given are:

Measure of Angle(J,L,K) is 25 degrees. That's angle at point L, between points J, L, K. Wait, no. The notation Angle(J,L,K) refers to the angle at point L, formed by points J, L, K. So that's angle J-L-K, meaning vertex at L, with sides LJ and LK. So that angle is part of triangle JKL, perhaps?

But also, there's Angle(K,L,N) which is 18 degrees. That's angle at point L, between points K, L, N. So that's angle K-L-N, vertex at L, between K and N. And Angle(M,L,N) is 20 degrees, which is angle at L between M and N. Then, Angle(J,K,N) is 130 degrees, which is angle at point K between J, K, N.

Also, the triangle KLN is isosceles with KL ≅ LN. So in triangle KLN, sides KL and LN are equal. Therefore, as per the isosceles triangle, the base angles are those opposite the equal sides. Wait, the equal sides are KL and LN, so their opposite angles would be angles at N and K respectively. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle KLN, each side is opposite an angle. Side KL is opposite angle N. Side LN is opposite angle K. So if KL ≅ LN, then angles opposite them (angle N and angle K) are equal. Therefore, angle at N (of triangle KLN) equals angle at K (of triangle KLN).

But wait, angle at N of triangle KLN is angle KLN? No, wait. Let me get clear.

In triangle KLN:

- Vertex K: connected to L and N. So angle at K is angle LKN.

- Vertex L: connected to K and N. So angle at L is angle KLN.

- Vertex N: connected to K and L. So angle at N is angle KNL.

Wait, but the given angles include angle(K,L,N) which is angle at L between K and N. So that's angle KLN, which is the angle at L in triangle KLN. Also, angle(K,L,N) is given as 18 degrees. Wait, but earlier, another angle was given as angle(K,L,N) being 18 degrees. Wait, but I need to make sure.

Let me re-express the given angles:

Given:

MeasureOf(Angle(J,L,K)) = 25° → This is angle at L, between J, L, K → ∠JLK.

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,N)) = 20° → angle at L between M, L, N → ∠MLN.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,N)) = 18° → angle at L between K, L, N → same as ∠KLN. Wait, but earlier I thought that angle(K,L,N) is angle at L, so that's ∠KLN. But according to the problem statement, that's given as 18°. However, triangle KLN is isosceles with KL ≅ LN. So in triangle KLN, the sides KL and LN are congruent. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. Which angles are opposite KL and LN?

Side KL is opposite angle N (since in triangle KLN, side KL is opposite angle N). Similarly, side LN is opposite angle K. Therefore, if KL ≅ LN, then angles opposite them (angle N and angle K) are equal. So angle at N (∠KNL) equals angle at K (∠LKN).

But angle at K in triangle KLN is ∠LKN. What is that angle? Well, in triangle KLN, sum of angles is 180°. We know angle at L (∠KLN) is 18°, so the other two angles sum to 162°, and since they're equal, each is 81°. Therefore, angles at K and N are each 81°. Wait, but angle at K in triangle KLN is ∠LKN, which is part of the larger figure.

However, there's also another angle given: MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,N)) = 130°, which is angle at K between J, K, N. So that's ∠JKN. So that angle is 130°, which might involve triangle JKN.

Wait, let me try to visualize this. Points J, K, L, M, N. Triangles JKL, KLN, LMN. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Starting with triangle KLN. It's isosceles with KL = LN, and angle at L (∠KLN) is 18°, so angles at K and N are each (180-18)/2 = 81°, as above. So angle at K (∠LKN) is 81°, and angle at N (∠KNL) is 81°.

Then, there's triangle LMN, which is also isosceles. Given Congruent(Line(L,N), Line(N,M)), so LN ≅ NM. Therefore, triangle LMN has sides LN and NM congruent. Thus, triangle LMN is isosceles with legs LN and NM. Therefore, the base angles at N and M are equal. Wait, but angle at L is given as ∠MLN = 20°, right? Because MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,N)) is 20°, which is angle at L between M and N, i.e., ∠MLN = 20°.

Therefore, in triangle LMN, angles at N and M are equal. Let me compute them. Sum of angles in triangle LMN is 180°, so angles at N and M are equal. Let’s denote them as x. Then:

∠MLN + 2x = 180° ⇒ 20° + 2x = 180 ⇒ 2x = 160 ⇒ x = 80°. Therefore, angles at N and M in triangle LMN are each 80°. So ∠MNL = 80°, and ∠LMN = 80°.

Now, looking back at triangle KLN, angle at N (∠KNL) is 81°, as computed earlier. But angle ∠KNL is adjacent to angle ∠MNL in triangle LMN? Wait, because point N is connected to L and M. So maybe lines NL and NM form angle at N, which is part of both triangle KLN and LMN.

Wait, angle at N in triangle KLN is ∠KNL = 81°, and angle at N in triangle LMN is ∠MNL = 80°. These two angles at point N are adjacent? If points K, N, M are arranged such that angles at N from K to L and from M to L are adjacent. Wait, but how do these points connect?

Assuming that points K, L, N, M are connected in some way. Let me think about the connections:

We have line segments:

- Line(J,K)

- Line(K,L)

- Line(L,N)

- Line(N,M)

- Line(L,M)

- Line(K,N)

So, connecting J to K, K to L, L to N, N to M, L to M, and K to N.

So, the diagram includes triangles JKL, KLN, LMN.

From the points:

- Point J connected to K and L via J-K and L-M? Not sure yet. Let me see.

But focusing on point N: connected to L, M, and K (from K-N). So point N is connected to K, L, M.

At point N, we have angles from different triangles. For example, in triangle KLN, angle at N is ∠KNL = 81°, and in triangle LMN, angle at N is ∠MNL = 80°. Are these angles adjacent? If you imagine point N connected to K, L, and M. So the angle between NK and NL is ∠KNL = 81°, and the angle between NL and NM is ∠MNL = 80°. Therefore, the total angle around point N would be ∠KNL + ∠MNL = 81° + 80° = 161°. But wait, unless there's another angle at point N involving other points, like if there's a line from N to somewhere else. However, based on the given connections, only K, L, M are connected to N. Therefore, the total angle around point N would be 81° + 80° = 161°, leaving 19° for other possible angles? Wait, but angles around a point sum to 360°, but if only three lines meet at N (NK, NL, NM), then the sum of angles between those lines would be 360°. However, if the angles between NK and NL is 81°, and between NL and NM is 80°, then the remaining angle between NM and NK would be 360 - 81 - 80 = 199°? That seems too large, but maybe that's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that the angles don't wrap around 360°, but rather form parts of the figure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line or something. Hmm. Maybe not necessary to consider the full 360° here.

But moving on. Now, considering triangle JKL. The given angle is ∠JLK = 25°, which is angle at L between J, L, K. So that's part of triangle JKL. Also, we have angle JKN = 130°, which is angle at K between J, K, N. Let me see. So angle JKN is part of triangle JKN. Let me try to find relationships here.

First, let's look at triangle JKL. We know angle at L (∠JLK) is 25°, and we might need more info about its other angles. Also, we know from earlier that angle at K in triangle KLN is ∠LKN = 81°, which is the same as angle at K between L and N. Wait, but angle JKN is at point K between J, K, N. So that angle is composed of angle JKL (part of triangle JKL) plus angle LKN (from triangle KLN)? Or is there overlap?

Yes! Let me think. At point K, we have lines going to J, L, and N. So the angle between JK and KL is ∠JKL (which is part of triangle JKL), and the angle between KL and KN is ∠LKN (from triangle KLN). Additionally, the angle between JK and KN is ∠JKN, which is given as 130°. Therefore, ∠JKN = ∠JKL + ∠LKN. So:

∠JKN = ∠JKL + ∠LKN

We know ∠JKN is 130°, and ∠LKN is 81°, so:

130° = ∠JKL + 81° ⇒ ∠JKL = 130° - 81° = 49°

So angle JKL is 49°, which is part of triangle JKL. Now, in triangle JKL, we can find other angles. Let me recall that triangle JKL has angles at J, K, and L. We know angle at L (∠JLK) is 25°, and angle at K (∠JKL) is 49°, so the third angle at J (∠KJL) can be found by:

Sum of angles in triangle = 180°

Thus:

∠KJL + ∠JKL + ∠JLK = 180°

Plugging in numbers:

∠KJL + 49° + 25° = 180° ⇒ ∠KJL = 180 - 49 - 25 = 106°

So angle at J in triangle JKL is 106°, which is ∠KJL. But the question asks for the measure of angle J. Wait, is that the same as ∠KJL? Yes, because angle J in triangle JKL is ∠KJL, which is the angle at point J between K and L.

Wait, but the problem says "Find the measure of ∠J". Assuming that ∠J refers to angle at point J, which in this case is ∠KJL, which we just found as 106°. But let me confirm that there isn't another angle at point J involved. Looking back at the given data, there's only triangle JKL involving point J. So angle J is likely referring to ∠KJL, which we found as 106°, so the answer would be option B (106). But let me check if there's anything missing.

Wait, let me verify once again. Let's recap:

- In triangle KLN, angles at K and N are each 81°, since it's isosceles with KL=LN and angle at L is 18°.

- Then, angle at K in triangle KLN is ∠LKN = 81°, which is part of angle JKN = 130°, leading us to ∠JKL = 49°, which gives angle at J in triangle JKL as 106°, which seems straightforward.

But wait, could there be another triangle involving point J? Like triangle JKN? Let me check. The given line segments include Line(J,K), Line(K,N), so triangle JKN exists. In triangle JKN, we have angle at K (∠JKN) = 130°, and sides... but we might not have enough info. However, since we already used the relationship between angles at K to find angle JKL, and thus angle J, maybe that's sufficient.

But let me cross-validate. Suppose we consider triangle JKN. In triangle JKN, we know angle at K is 130°, and we might want to find other angles. But without knowing sides or other angles, it's hard. But if we assume that our calculation for angle J is correct, then 106° would correspond to option B.

Wait, but the answer choices are A. 105, B. 106, C. 108, D. 111. So 106 is option B. But let me check again for errors.

Another thing to check: in triangle LMN, which is isosceles with LN ≅ NM. Earlier, I said that angles at N and M are each 80°, but let me confirm that. In triangle LMN, angle at L is 20°, and sides LN ≅ NM. So the two equal sides are LN and NM, so the base is LM, and the apex at N? Wait, no. Wait, if sides LN and NM are congruent, then the apex is at N, and the base is LM. Therefore, the base angles are at L and M. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle LMN, the two equal sides are LN and MN. So the apex is at N, and the base is LM. Therefore, the base angles are at L and M. So angles at L and M are equal. Wait, but earlier I considered angle at L (∠MLN) as 20°, so that would mean angle at L is 20°, and angle at M is also 20°, but then the third angle at N would be 180 - 20 - 20 = 140°. But earlier I thought that angles at N and M were equal, which led to 80°, but that was wrong.

Wait, here's a mistake! Earlier, I assumed that in triangle LMN, since LN ≅ NM, the base angles are at N and M. But that's incorrect. The base angles are at the ends of the base. If the two equal sides are LN and NM, then the apex is at N, and the base is LM. Hence, the base angles are at L and M. Therefore, angles at L and M are equal. But angle at L (∠MLN) is given as 20°, so angle at M is also 20°, hence angle at N is 140°. Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. That changes things!

This is critical. Let me redo that part.

In triangle LMN, given that LN ≅ NM. Therefore, sides LN and NM are congruent. Therefore, the triangle has two equal sides: LN and NM. Therefore, the base is LM, and the apex is at N. Therefore, the base angles are at L and M. Hence, angles at L and M are equal. Given that angle at L (∠MLN) is 20°, so angle at M is also 20°, so the third angle at N is 180 - 20 - 20 = 140°. Therefore, angle at N in triangle LMN is ∠MNL = 140°, not 80° as previously thought. That was a key error.

So correcting that:

In triangle LMN, angles at L and M are 20°, angle at N is 140°.

Now, returning to point N. Previously, I had considered angles at N from triangle KLN (∠KNL = 81°) and from triangle LMN (∠MNL = 140°). However, these angles are adjacent? Let me think about the configuration.

At point N, we have lines connecting to K, L, and M. The angle between NL and NK is ∠KNL = 81°, and the angle between NL and NM is ∠MNL = 140°. Wait, but depending on the arrangement, these angles could be adjacent or overlapping. If the lines NK and NM are on opposite sides of NL, then the total angle around point N would be ∠KNL + ∠MNL = 81° + 140° = 221°, which is less than 360°, implying there's another angle. However, if the lines are arranged such that ∠KNL and ∠MNL are adjacent forming a larger angle, but I need to check if that makes sense.

Wait, actually, the angle between NK and NL is ∠KNL = 81°, and the angle between NL and NM is ∠MNL = 140°. Depending on the direction of the points, these could be adjacent or not. However, assuming that points K, N, M are arranged such that from point N, lines go to K, L, and M. So if you imagine standing at point N, facing towards L, then turning towards K (which would be ∠KNL = 81°), and then turning towards M (which would be ∠MNL = 140°). Wait, but that depends on the exact configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between NK and NM is the sum of ∠KNL and ∠MNL? Or maybe there's some overlap. But without a diagram, it's tricky, but perhaps we can use the fact that in triangle KLN, angle at N is ∠KNL = 81°, and in triangle LMN, angle at N is ∠MNL = 140°, so together they form a larger angle at N. But since there's no mention of another angle at N, perhaps the lines NK and NM are on the same side relative to NL, causing the angles to add up? Wait, that may not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the angle between NK and NM is 81° + 140° = 221°, but that seems very large. However, perhaps there's another consideration.

Wait, but in reality, when dealing with triangles, the angles at a common vertex depend on how the points are connected. Let me think again about triangle KLN and LMN sharing the side LN.

In triangle KLN, angle at N is ∠KNL = 81°, and in triangle LMN, angle at N is ∠MNL = 140°. So if we consider point N connected to K, L, and M, then the angle between NK and NL is 81°, and the angle between NL and NM is 140°, so the total angle between NK and NM would be 81° + 140° = 221°, which implies that the angle between NK and NM is 221°, which is possible if the points are arranged in a certain way. However, this might not directly affect our current problem, unless there's another relation.

But going back to the main problem: finding angle J. Earlier, we calculated angle JKL as 49°, leading to angle at J in triangle JKL as 106°, but we need to ensure that there are no other factors affecting angle J.

Wait, but maybe there's another triangle involving point J? For instance, triangle JKN? Let me check. We have points J, K, N. So triangle JKN exists. In triangle JKN, we know angle at K is 130°, and we might find other angles. However, we need to determine if there's more information.

Let me attempt to calculate angles in triangle JKN. To do that, we need more information. For example, if we can find another angle or side length relations. However, given that we don't have side lengths, but perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines?

Alternatively, since we have multiple triangles connected, maybe we can relate them.

But first, let me check if there are other angles related to point J.

Earlier, we found that in triangle JKL, angle at J is ∠KJL = 106°, which is angle J. But is there any possibility that angle J refers to another angle? For example, if there's another triangle involving J and another point? For instance, if there's a triangle JKM or something else? Based on the given line segments, we have Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(L,N), etc. So point J is connected to K, and K is connected to L and N. So J is only connected to K and possibly others? Not sure.

But assuming that angle J refers to ∠KJL, which is the angle at J in triangle JKL, which we calculated as 106°, then that would be answer B. But let me check again the steps where mistakes might have occurred.

Let me retrace:

1. Triangle KLN is isosceles with KL ≅ LN. Given angle at L (∠KLN) is 18°, so angles at K and N are (180 - 18)/2 = 81°. So ∠LKN = 81°, which is angle at K between L and N.

2. Given angle JKN = 130°, which is angle at K between J and N. So this angle is made up of angle between J and L (∠JKL) plus angle between L and N (∠LKN). So ∠JKL = 130° - 81° = 49°.

3. In triangle JKL, angles are ∠JKL = 49°, ∠JLK = 25°, so ∠KJL = 180 - 49 - 25 = 106°, which is angle at J.

But earlier, I made a mistake regarding triangle LMN's angles, but that seems unrelated to angle J. Unless there's another connection. Wait, but maybe there's another triangle involving J? Or another angle?

Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral or another triangle that affects this.

Wait, another thing to check: Is triangle JKL the only triangle involving point J? Yes, according to the given points and lines. So angle J is indeed ∠KJL = 106°, which corresponds to option B. But let me check if there's any other constraint that might affect this value.

Wait, but in triangle LMN, we found that angle at N is 140°, which is ∠MNL = 140°, and in triangle KLN, angle at N is ∠KNL = 81°. If those angles are adjacent, then the total angle at N would be 81° + 140° = 221°, which is possible. But how does this affect anything else?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a line connecting J to N, creating another triangle? But there's no mention of that in the given constraints. The line segments are J-K, K-L, L-N, N-M, L-M, and K-N. So J is connected to K, and K is connected to N. So J is connected to K, and N is connected to K. So line JN is not explicitly mentioned, but it's implied through the triangle JKN. However, even so, that doesn't introduce new information beyond what we've used.

Wait, but another idea: Could angle J be affected by other triangles? For example, if there's a triangle involving J, L, and M? But there's no direct connection given between J and M. The only connections are J-K, K-L, L-N, N-M, L-M, and K-N.

Unless there's an implicit connection between J and M, but the problem didn't specify that. So I think the initial conclusion stands.

But let me double-check the calculation for ∠KJL. In triangle JKL:

∠JKL = 49°, ∠JLK = 25°, so ∠KJL = 180 - 49 - 25 = 106°. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the measure of angle J is 106°, which is option B. However, let me check if there's any alternative interpretation.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps angle J refers to a different angle? For example, in triangle JKN, angle at J? But we don't have information about that. However, if we consider triangle JKN, we could try to find angles.

In triangle JKN, we know angle at K is 130°, and we might relate sides. But without more info, it's hard. However, if we suppose that triangle JKN is related to other triangles...

But since we have KL ≅ LN, and LN ≅ NM, so KL ≅ LN ≅ NM. So KL = LN = NM.

If we can find relations between sides, maybe using Law of Sines or Cosines.

For example, in triangle KLN, sides KL = LN, and angles at K and N are 81°, angle at L is 18°.

Using Law of Sines:

KL / sin(∠KNL) = LN / sin(∠LKN) = KN / sin(∠KLN)

Since KL = LN, and ∠KNL = ∠LKN = 81°, which checks out.

Similarly, in triangle LMN, sides LN = NM, angles at L and M are 20°, angle at N is 140°.

Law of Sines:

LN / sin(∠LMN) = NM / sin(∠MLN) = LM / sin(∠MNL)

Which would give LN / sin(20°) = NM / sin(20°) = LM / sin(140°). So LM = LN * sin(140°) / sin(20°).

But maybe this isn't helpful for our current problem.

Alternatively, looking back at triangle JKL. If we can find sides ratios, but again, without specific lengths, it's difficult.

But since we've already derived angle J as 106°, and that seems consistent with the given information, I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check if there's a possibility that angle J is not ∠KJL but another angle. For example, if there's a reflex angle or something. But no, typically in such problems, angles are considered as the smaller ones unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ∠JKL. Let me recheck:

∠JKN = 130°, which is angle at K between J and N.

This angle is split into ∠JKL (between J and L) and ∠LKN (between L and N). So yes, ∠JKN = ∠JKL + ∠LKN.

Given ∠LKN = 81°, then ∠JKL = 130° - 81° = 49°, correct.

Then in triangle JKL, angles:

At L: 25°, at K: 49°, so angle at J is 180 - 25 - 49 = 106°, correct.

Therefore, the answer should be B. 106.

But wait, the answer choices include B. 106. So that's the answer. But let me check again for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, another angle to consider: In triangle LMN, angle at N is 140°, which is ∠MNL. Earlier, I thought that ∠KNL (from triangle KLN) is 81°, which is angle at N between K and L. So if you imagine point N with lines to K, L, and M, then the angle between K and L is 81°, and the angle between L and M is 140°, so the total angle between K and M would be 81 + 140 = 221°, but that's not directly relevant. However, if there's a line from N to J, but there's no such line mentioned. So nothing to adjust here.

Hence, I believe the correct answer is B. 106°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and identifying the key relationships among the given angles and triangles.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Structure**

We are given several triangles:
- $ \triangle KLN $
- $ \triangle LMN $
- $ \triangle JKL $

And the following facts:
- $ \angle J, L, K = 25^\circ $
- $ \angle M, L, N = 20^\circ $
- $ \angle K, L, N = 18^\circ $
- $ \angle J, K, N = 130^\circ $
- $ \triangle KLN $ and $ \triangle LMN $ are isosceles
- $ KL \cong LN $ and $ LN \cong NM $

These imply that:
- In $ \triangle KLN $, sides $ KL $ and $ LN $ are congruent, so it is isosceles with base $ KN $ and equal angles at $ K $ and $ N $
- In $ \triangle LMN $, sides $ LN $ and $ NM $ are congruent, so it is isosceles with base $ LM $ and equal angles at $ L $ and $ M $

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle Properties to Determine Angles**

#### **In Triangle $ KLN $:**
- Given: $ \angle K, L, N = \angle KLN = 18^\circ $
- Since $ KL \cong LN $, triangle $ KLN $ is isosceles with base angles at $ K $ and $ N $ equal
- Total angles in triangle: $ 180^\circ $
- Therefore, angles at $ K $ and $ N $:  
  $$
  \frac{180^\circ - 18^\circ}{2} = 81^\circ
  $$

So:
- $ \angle LKN = \angle KNL = 81^\circ $

#### **In Triangle $ LMN $:**
- Given: $ \angle M, L, N = \angle MLN = 20^\circ $
- Since $ LN \cong NM $, triangle $ LMN $ is isosceles with base angles at $ L $ and $ M $
- Total angles in triangle: $ 180^\circ $
- Therefore, angles at $ L $ and $ M $:  
  $$
  \frac{180^\circ - 20^\circ}{2} = 80^\circ
  $$

So:
- $ \angle MNL = \angle LMN = 80^\circ $

Note: This contradicts the original assumption that the base angles were at $ N $ and $ M $. Correctly, since $ LN \cong NM $, the equal angles are at $ L $ and $ M $, and the unequal angle is at $ N $, which becomes:
$$
\angle MNL = 180^\circ - 20^\circ - 80^\circ = 80^\circ
$$

### **Step 3: Analyze Triangle $ JKL $**

We are told:
- $ \angle J, K, N = 130^\circ $ — this is angle at $ K $, between $ J $ and $ N $
- From Step 2: $ \angle LKN = 81^\circ $
- So, $ \angle JKL = \angle JKN - \angle LKN = 130^\circ - 81^\circ = 49^\circ $

Now, in triangle $ JKL $, we are given:
- $ \angle J, L, K = 25^\circ $
- $ \angle JKL = 49^\circ $

Use the triangle angle sum to find $ \angle KJL $ (i.e., angle at $ J $):
$$
\angle KJL = 180^\circ - \angle JKL - \angle JKL' 
= 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 25^\circ = 106^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The angle at point $ J $, denoted as $ \angle KJL $, is therefore:
$$
\boxed{106^\circ}
$$

This matches **Option B**.
