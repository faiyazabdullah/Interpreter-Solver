<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a regular pentagon and a square sharing a mutual vertex X. Then there are two sides XY and XZ that are sides of another regular polygon with a vertex at X. We need to find how many sides this third polygon has. The answer choices are A. 19, B. 20, C. 28, D. 32.

First, I need to recall some properties of regular polygons. In a regular polygon with n sides, each interior angle can be calculated using the formula ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. Also, the measure of each central angle (the angle subtended at the center by one side) is 360/n degrees. But maybe more importantly, when you have two adjacent sides meeting at a vertex, the angle between them is the interior angle of the polygon.

Now, the problem mentions that the pentagon and square share a mutual vertex X. Let me visualize this. Let me think about the points mentioned. From the given information, there's a square BCYX and a pentagon ABCDZ. Wait, but the square is B, C, Y, X. So vertices B, C, Y, X form a square. And the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So point X is part of both the square and the pentagon? Wait, no, the square is B, C, Y, X. So X is one of its vertices. The pentagon includes points A, B, C, D, Z. So perhaps X is connected to B and C? Or maybe Z is connected to X? Wait, the pentagon's sides include line ZA. Hmm. Maybe I should sketch a rough diagram mentally.

But since it's a regular pentagon, all sides are equal and all internal angles are 108 degrees. For the square, all sides are equal and internal angles are 90 degrees. Now, the square shares vertex X with the pentagon. Wait, but which vertices are shared? The square is B, C, Y, X. So X is a vertex of the square. The pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So the common vertex between the square and pentagon would be B and C? Wait, because the square has vertices B and C as well. Wait, the square is B-C-Y-X. So the square has edges BC, CY, YX, XB. The pentagon has edges AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So the square and pentagon share the edge BC. Therefore, points B and C are common to both the square and the pentagon. However, the problem says they share a mutual vertex X. Wait, maybe X is a vertex of both? Wait, the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So unless X is also part of the pentagon? Wait, the pentagon ends with Z. So perhaps X is not directly part of the pentagon. Wait, but then the problem states that the sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon. So X is connected to Y and Z, which are parts of the square and the pentagon respectively. Wait, so X is connected to Y (from the square) and Z (from the pentagon). Wait, but how does Z relate to the pentagon? The pentagon has vertices up to Z. So Z is connected to D and A. So maybe the pentagon's last vertex is Z, which connects back to A. 

So, the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So the square's vertex X is connected to B via the square's side XB. Also, the pentagon's vertex Z is connected to D and A. But how do these connect to X? The problem says that sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon. So XY is part of the square (since square has side YX?), and XZ is a side of the third polygon. Wait, but XZ isn't necessarily a side of the pentagon. Wait, the pentagon's sides are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So Z is connected to D and A. So maybe XZ is a new line connecting X to Z. So, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. So the third polygon has X as a vertex, and sides XY and XZ. Since it's a regular polygon, all sides are equal, and all angles are equal. 

Wait, but for a regular polygon, the angle between two adjacent sides at a vertex is the interior angle. So, if XY and XZ are two sides of the same regular polygon, then the angle between them at X would be the interior angle of that polygon. But wait, how is this angle determined? Because X is connected to Y (from the square) and to Z (from the pentagon). So the angle between XY and XZ at point X would be formed by those two lines. To find that angle, we need to determine the angle between the square's side XY and the pentagon's side XZ.

But first, let's think about the positions of points. Let me try to imagine the configuration. Let's assume that square BCYX has sides BC, CY, YX, and XB. Since it's a square, each angle is 90 degrees. The pentagon ABCDZ is regular, so each internal angle is 108 degrees. Now, point X is part of the square. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since BC is a side of both the square and the pentagon, and BC is congruent to other sides (as per the given constraints Congruent(Line(B,C), Line(C,D)) etc.), meaning all sides of the pentagon are equal length. Similarly, all sides of the square are equal. Let me suppose that each side length is 1 unit for easier calculation.

So, starting with square BCYX. If B is at (0,0), then assuming BC is along the x-axis. So point C would be at (1,0). Then, since BCYX is a square, moving from B(0,0) to C(1,0), then next side CY would be upwards. Since squares have right angles, so from C(1,0), moving upward to Y. Assuming standard orientation, Y would be at (1,1). Then from Y(1,1), moving left to X, which would be at (0,1). Then from X(0,1) back to B(0,0). Wait, but that makes the square BCYX with coordinates B(0,0), C(1,0), Y(1,1), X(0,1). That seems correct.

Now, the pentagon is ABCDZ. It's a regular pentagon, so all sides equal, each internal angle 108 degrees. Points A, B, C, D, Z. So B is (1,0) as above, and C is (1,0)? Wait, no. Wait earlier, I set B at (0,0), C at (1,0). So in the square BCYX, B is (0,0), C is (1,0), Y is (1,1), X is (0,1). Now, the pentagon ABCDZ includes points A, B, C, D, Z. So starting from B(1,0), moving to C(1,0)? Wait, no. Wait, the pentagon is A-B-C-D-Z-A. So the order is A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to Z, Z connected to A. Since it's a regular pentagon, each side is length 1, and each internal angle is 108 degrees.

But how do we position the rest of the points? Let me try to build this step by step. Starting with point B at (1,0) and point C at (1,0)? Wait no, that can't be. Wait earlier, I had B at (0,0), C at (1,0). Wait, but in the square BCYX, B was at (0,0), C at (1,0). Then the pentagon ABCDZ includes B and C as consecutive vertices. So, the pentagon starts at A, goes to B, then to C, then to D, then to Z, then back to A.

So, the pentagon has side AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. All of these sides are length 1. Now, since BC is already part of the square, which we've placed from (0,0) to (1,0). So point B is (0,0), point C is (1,0). Now, we need to find coordinates for the other points of the pentagon.

In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108 degrees. So, starting from point B(0,0), going to C(1,0). The next side is CD. Let me try to compute coordinates for D. Since BC is horizontal from (0,0) to (1,0). The direction from C to D will make an internal angle of 108 degrees. Wait, the internal angle at point C is 108 degrees. So the angle between BC and CD is 108 degrees.

Since BC is pointing from B to C, which is along positive x-axis. At point C, the internal angle is 108 degrees. So the direction from C to D turns 108 degrees relative to the previous direction. Wait, the direction from B to C is along positive x-axis. The direction from C to D would be such that the angle between CB (which is towards the left, from C to B) and CD is 108 degrees. Wait, maybe better to use vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since constructing coordinates might get complex, but let's try. Let me denote the coordinates:

Let’s fix the square first. As before, B is at (0,0), C is at (1,0), Y is at (1,1), X is at (0,1).

Now, for the pentagon ABCDZ. Let me try to find coordinates of D and Z.

Starting from B(0,0) to C(1,0). Next, from C(1,0) to D. The direction from C to D must form an internal angle of 108 degrees at point C. The previous segment was BC, which went from B(0,0) to C(1,0); the direction here is along positive x-axis. The internal angle at C is between BC and CD. Since the internal angle is 108 degrees, the external angle (the turn when traversing the pentagon) is 72 degrees (since internal + external = 180). Wait, the external angle for a regular polygon is 360/n. For pentagon, n=5, so each external angle is 72 degrees. So, when moving from BC to CD, the direction changes by 72 degrees. Wait, but depending on the orientation of the pentagon (clockwise or counterclockwise). Let me assume the pentagon is oriented counterclockwise.

Assuming that the pentagon is ordered A-B-C-D-Z-A in counterclockwise order. So, moving from B to C to D, etc. So, at point C, the direction from B to C is towards increasing x-axis (from B(0,0) to C(1,0)). Then, the direction from C to D would turn left by the external angle. Wait, external angle is the supplement of the internal angle. Wait, for a convex polygon, the sum of internal and external angles at a vertex is 180 degrees. So, internal angle is 108 degrees, so external angle is 72 degrees. When traversing the polygon, at each vertex, you turn by the external angle. So, if the pentagon is being drawn counterclockwise, at each vertex, you turn left by the external angle. So, from BC to CD, the direction changes by 72 degrees to the left.

The direction from B to C is along the positive x-axis. Turning left by 72 degrees would mean the new direction is 72 degrees above the previous direction. Wait, original direction was along positive x-axis (angle 0 degrees). After turning left by 72 degrees, the new direction is 0 + 72 = 72 degrees from the positive x-axis. Wait, no. Wait, when you're moving along BC towards C, then at point C, you turn left by the external angle (72 degrees) to head towards D. So, if the previous direction was along the positive x-axis (from B to C), then after turning left by 72 degrees, the new direction is 72 degrees above the positive x-axis. Therefore, the direction from C to D is 72 degrees from the x-axis.

Therefore, vector CD has direction 72 degrees. The length of CD is 1, same as BC. So, coordinates of D can be calculated by moving from point C(1,0) in direction 72 degrees for length 1.

Calculating coordinates of D:

x-coordinate: 1 + cos(72°)
y-coordinate: 0 + sin(72°)

cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511

So approximate coordinates of D are (1 + 0.3090, 0 + 0.9511) ≈ (1.3090, 0.9511)

Now, proceeding to the next side CD to DZ. The next internal angle at D is 108 degrees. Again, the direction from C to D is 72 degrees. The external angle is 72 degrees again, so the direction from D to Z will change by another 72 degrees left.

So, current direction from C to D is 72 degrees. Adding another 72 degrees gives direction of 72 + 72 = 144 degrees from the positive x-axis. Thus, the direction from D to Z is 144 degrees.

Length of DZ is 1, so coordinates of Z are:

x = D_x + cos(144°)
y = D_y + sin(144°)

Compute cos(144°): cos(180°−36°)= -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090
sin(144°)= sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878

Thus,

x = 1.3090 + (-0.8090) ≈ 1.3090 - 0.8090 = 0.5
y = 0.9511 + 0.5878 ≈ 1.5389

So point Z is approximately at (0.5, 1.5389)

Then, from Z to A, which is the next side of the pentagon. The direction from D to Z is 144 degrees. The external angle again is 72 degrees, so the direction from Z to A is 144 + 72 = 216 degrees from positive x-axis.

So direction from Z to A is 216 degrees. Length is 1, so coordinates of A are:

x = Z_x + cos(216°)
y = Z_y + sin(216°)

cos(216°) = cos(180+36) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090
sin(216°) = sin(180+36) = -sin(36°) ≈ -0.5878

So:

x = 0.5 + (-0.8090) ≈ -0.3090
y = 1.5389 + (-0.5878) ≈ 0.9511

So point A is approximately at (-0.3090, 0.9511)

Now, check the last side ZA. From Z(0.5, 1.5389) to A(-0.3090, 0.9511). Let's verify the distance between Z and A should be 1.

Distance squared: (0.5 - (-0.3090))^2 + (1.5389 - 0.9511)^2 ≈ (0.8090)^2 + (0.5878)^2 ≈ 0.6545 + 0.3455 ≈ 1.0. Correct. So that checks out.

Now, we need to find the angle at point X between sides XY and XZ. Because the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, so the angle between them at X is the internal angle of that polygon.

First, let's find coordinates of X, Y, Z.

From earlier setup:

- X is at (0,1) (from square BCYX).
- Y is at (1,1).
- Z is at approximately (0.5, 1.5389).

So, we have points X(0,1), Y(1,1), Z(0.5, ~1.5389).

We need to calculate the angle between vectors XY and XZ at point X.

Vector XY is from X to Y: (1-0, 1-1) = (1, 0)
Vector XZ is from X to Z: (0.5 - 0, 1.5389 - 1) = (0.5, 0.5389)

Wait, but actually, since we need the angle between XY and XZ at X, we can compute the angle between vectors XY and XZ.

But XY is from X to Y: direction is (1,0), as above.

XZ is from X to Z: direction is (0.5, 0.5389). Wait, but let me confirm exact value for Z's y-coordinate.

Earlier, when calculating Z's coordinates:

After D was at approx (1.3090, 0.9511), adding cos(144°) and sin(144°):

For Z's x-coordinate: 1.3090 + cos(144°) = 1.3090 - cos(36°). Cos(36°) is approximately 0.8090, so 1.3090 - 0.8090 = 0.5. Correct.

For Z's y-coordinate: 0.9511 + sin(144°) = 0.9511 + sin(36°). Sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878, so total ≈ 0.9511 + 0.5878 ≈ 1.5389. Correct.

So Z is at (0.5, 1.5389). Therefore, vector XZ is from X(0,1) to Z(0.5, 1.5389): Δx = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5, Δy = 1.5389 - 1 = 0.5389.

So vector XY is (1, 0) and vector XZ is (0.5, 0.5389). Now, the angle between these two vectors is the angle between XY and XZ, which is the internal angle of the third regular polygon.

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cosθ = (v · w) / (|v||w|)

Where v is vector XY and w is vector XZ.

Compute the dot product:

v · w = (1)(0.5) + (0)(0.5389) = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5

|v| = sqrt(1² + 0²) = 1

|w| = sqrt(0.5² + 0.5389²) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.2903) ≈ sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735

So cosθ ≈ 0.5 / (1 * 0.735) ≈ 0.5 / 0.735 ≈ 0.679

Then θ ≈ arccos(0.679). Let me calculate that.

Arccos(0.679) is roughly... Well, cos(45°) ≈ 0.707, which is larger than 0.679. So angle is slightly larger than 45 degrees. Let me compute it numerically.

Using calculator input: arccos(0.679) ≈ ?

Well, cos(45°) ≈ 0.7071, cos(50°) ≈ 0.6428. Our value is 0.679, which is between 45° and 50°. Let me find the exact value.

Let me compute:

At θ = 47 degrees: cos(47°) ≈ 0.6820. Close to our value of 0.679. So θ ≈ 47 degrees. Let me see:

If cosθ ≈ 0.679, then θ ≈ 47.2 degrees (approximate). Let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, since we know exact values from the construction, maybe we can compute it symbolically.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about the actual angle.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for X, Y, and Z, we can compute the angle at X between XY and XZ using coordinates.

Another approach: Compute the slopes of XY and XZ, then compute the angle between them.

XY is from X(0,1) to Y(1,1): horizontal line to the right, slope is 0 (horizontal). Vector is along positive x-axis.

XZ is from X(0,1) to Z(0.5, 1.5389). The slope is (1.5389 - 1)/(0.5 - 0) = 0.5389 / 0.5 = 1.0778. So the angle of this line with respect to the x-axis is arctangent of 1.0778.

Which is arctan(1.0778). Let me calculate that.

arctan(1.0778) ≈ 47.2 degrees (since tan(45°)=1, tan(47.2°)≈tan(45 + 2.2) ≈ 1 + ...). So yes, around 47.2 degrees.

Since XY is along the x-axis, the angle between XY and XZ is 47.2 degrees. This is the internal angle of the third regular polygon.

Wait, but for a regular polygon with n sides, each internal angle is ((n-2)/n)*180 degrees. So, if we can find this angle, we can solve for n.

Let me write the equation:

((n-2)/n) * 180 = angle at X.

But wait, the angle we just calculated is the internal angle of the polygon. So:

internal_angle = [(n-2)/n] * 180 = angle_between_XY_and_XZ ≈ 47.2 degrees.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in a regular polygon, the internal angle is the angle inside the polygon at each vertex. However, in our case, the angle between XY and XZ is the angle between two adjacent sides of the third polygon. Therefore, that angle is indeed the internal angle of the polygon. So solving for n:

[(n-2)/n] * 180 = θ, where θ ≈ 47.2 degrees.

But let me check whether my calculation of θ is accurate. Earlier steps may have approximation errors due to rounding. Let me try to calculate θ more precisely.

First, let's recompute the vectors without approximating coordinates.

Let me recall that point Z was derived based on the regular pentagon. Perhaps there's a more exact way to calculate the coordinates.

Alternatively, since we know that in a regular pentagon, the coordinates can be represented using trigonometric functions with exact expressions involving the golden ratio. However, maybe there's a relationship between the angles here.

Alternatively, maybe instead of coordinates, we can use the fact that in the square and pentagon, certain angles are known.

Let me think differently. Let me consider the angle between XY and XZ. 

In the square BCYX, angle at X is 90 degrees. Wait, but XY is part of the square. Wait, in the square BCYX, the angle at X is between YX and XB. So, in the square, angle at X is 90 degrees. But we're looking at the angle between XY and XZ. So, XY is one side of the square, and XZ is a line from X to Z. What is the angle between XY and XZ?

Alternatively, considering the entire structure: the square has angle at X of 90 degrees between XY and XB. The pentagon has a side from X to Z? Wait, no, Z is connected to D and A. Wait, but how is X related to Z? In the pentagon, Z is connected to D and A, but X is a separate point. So the line XZ connects X to Z. So, to find the angle between XY and XZ at X, we need to find the angle between XY (part of square) and XZ (connecting to pentagon's point Z).

Perhaps using the law of cosines in triangle XYZ? Wait, but we don't know the lengths of XZ or XY. Wait, XY is a side of the square, so length equals BC, which is same as the pentagon's side length. So if we assume all sides are length 1, then XY = 1, XZ is the distance from X to Z.

Wait, earlier we computed coordinates for X(0,1), Z(0.5, 1.5389). So distance XZ is sqrt( (0.5)^2 + (0.5389)^2 ). Let me calculate that:

(0.5)^2 = 0.25

(0.5389)^2 ≈ 0.2903

Total ≈ 0.5403, so sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735. Which is the |w| we calculated earlier. But since XY is length 1, and XZ is approximately 0.735, but since the third polygon is regular, all sides must be equal. Wait, but if XY and XZ are sides of the third polygon, then their lengths must be equal. However, according to this, XY is length 1, and XZ is approximately 0.735. This suggests inconsistency. Wait, but that can't be. There's a contradiction here. Why?

Because the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, which implies that XY and XZ must be of equal length. But in our coordinate system, XY is length 1 (side of square), while XZ is shorter. This suggests that either my assumption of side length being 1 is incorrect, or there's something wrong in the setup.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The problem states that the square and pentagon are regular, so their sides are equal. However, in the problem statement, it's possible that the square and pentagon are not of the same side length. Wait, but in the given constraints, there is a congruence between Line(A,B) and Line(B,C), which are sides of the pentagon and square respectively. Because the problem states:

Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(B,C))

Which means that AB is congruent to BC. Since AB is a side of the pentagon and BC is a side of the square. Hence, all sides of the square and pentagon are congruent. Therefore, XY (a side of the square) and XZ (a side of the third polygon) must be congruent to each other. Therefore, my earlier assumption that XY is length 1 and XZ is different is invalid. Therefore, there must be an error in the coordinate calculation.

Wait, why did I assume that the square and pentagon have side length 1? Because I arbitrarily assigned coordinates, but perhaps the side lengths aren't normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all figures are scaled such that the sides are congruent. Therefore, in reality, the length of XY (square side) and XZ (pentagon side) must be equal. Therefore, in my coordinate system, I should ensure that XY and XZ have the same length.

This suggests that my coordinate assignment was flawed because I forced BC to be length 1, but then XZ turned out to be shorter. Therefore, I need to adjust the coordinates accordingly.

Alternative approach: Let's assign coordinates such that the square and pentagon have sides of length 's', and ensure that XY and XZ are of the same length.

However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, note that in the problem, the square and pentagon are regular, and they share a common side BC. Wait, no, they share a vertex X? Wait, the problem says "share a mutual vertex X". Wait, earlier analysis said that the square has vertices B, C, Y, X, and the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So, X is a vertex of the square, and the pentagon has vertex Z. But how is X related to the pentagon? Unless X is also a vertex of the pentagon? But the pentagon's vertices are A, B, C, D, Z. So X is not part of the pentagon. So, the only connection is through the square and pentagon having common side BC.

Wait, but the problem states that the square and pentagon share a mutual vertex X. So, X is a common vertex. Which would mean that X is a vertex of both the square and the pentagon. But in the pentagon, the vertices are A, B, C, D, Z. So, X must be one of those points. But in the given data, the pentagon is named as A,B,C,D,Z. So, X is not among the pentagon's vertices. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, the problem says: "A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X." So, X is a vertex of both the pentagon and the square. But according to the initial data, the pentagon is A,B,C,D,Z. So, X must be one of those letters. Wait, but the given data lists Point(X), so X is a separate point. Wait, this suggests that the pentagon has a vertex labeled Z, and the square has a vertex labeled X. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X. So X is a vertex of both the pentagon and the square. Hence, X must be one of the pentagon's vertices. Looking back at the given data:

Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z) – so vertices are A, B, C, D, Z.

Square(B,C,Y,X) – vertices are B, C, Y, X.

So, the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. Therefore, the overlapping vertices between square and pentagon are B and C. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X. Therefore, X must be a vertex of both the pentagon and the square. Therefore, X must be one of the pentagon's vertices. Hence, X must be either A, B, C, D, or Z. But in the square, X is one of its vertices, so X must be one of B, C, Y, or X itself. Therefore, the only possibility is that X is one of B or C, but the square's vertices are B, C, Y, X. If X is a vertex of the pentagon, then X must be one of A, B, C, D, Z. So X must be B or C. But in the square, X is a distinct vertex. Therefore, the only way for X to be a common vertex is if X is B or C. But in the square, the vertices are B, C, Y, X. So if X is B or C, then the square would have repeated vertices, which is not allowed. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the square and pentagon share a mutual vertex X, meaning that X is a vertex of both. So X is a vertex of both the square and the pentagon. Therefore, X must be one of the vertices of the pentagon. Given that the pentagon is A,B,C,D,Z, then X must be one of A, B, C, D, or Z. But the square is B,C,Y,X. So if X is a vertex of the pentagon, then X must be one of B, C, or possibly another letter. Wait, if X is one of the pentagon's vertices, say Z. Then the square would have vertices B, C, Y, Z. But the square is named as Square(B,C,Y,X), so X would be the fourth vertex. Hence, if X is Z, then the square is B, C, Y, Z. But then the pentagon's vertex Z is also part of the square. So, in that case, the square and pentagon share vertex Z. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X. So X is Z. Therefore, in this case, X is Z. Hence, the square is B, C, Y, Z, and the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So the square and pentagon share vertex Z, which is labeled as X in the problem. So X = Z.

Wait, this seems plausible. So the square is B, C, Y, X (with X being Z). So, in this scenario, X is Z. Therefore, the square is B, C, Y, Z, and the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. Hence, they share vertex Z (labeled as X). Therefore, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, which would be sides of the third polygon. But if X is Z, then XZ would be a side of the square, but the third polygon's sides are XY and XZ. Wait, but in this case, XY would be part of the square, and XZ would be part of the square as well? No, because if X is Z, then XZ is from Z to Z? No, that can't be. Wait, this suggests confusion in labeling.

Let me try to clarify. The problem says: "A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X." So X is a vertex of both. Given that the square is named as B,C,Y,X, and the pentagon is A,B,C,D,Z, then X must be one of the pentagon's vertices. Hence, X must be one of A, B, C, D, or Z. But in the square, X is a vertex, so it must be one of B, C, Y, or X. Hence, the only overlap is if X is B or C. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X, implying that X is a single point. Hence, if X is B or C, then the square and pentagon share that vertex. But then, the square's vertices are B, C, Y, X, where X is either B or C. For example, if X is B, then the square would be B, C, Y, B, which is degenerate. Not possible. Similarly for C. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that X is a new point, which is a vertex of both the square and the pentagon. Hence, the pentagon must have a vertex labeled X, but in the given data, the pentagon is A,B,C,D,Z. So this suggests that there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe X is a vertex of the pentagon, and the square has vertices B, C, Y, X, making X a vertex of both the square and the pentagon. Hence, the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, X, and the square is B, C, Y, X. So, the pentagon is A,B,C,D,X, and the square is B,C,Y,X. Hence, the pentagon's fifth vertex is X, which is also a vertex of the square. This would explain that the square and pentagon share vertex X.

In this case, the pentagon is A,B,C,D,X, and the square is B,C,Y,X. So the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, X. Therefore, they share vertices B, C, and X. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X, so X is the shared vertex. Hence, this makes sense.

With this correction, let's redefine the points. So, the pentagon is A, B, C, D, X. The square is B, C, Y, X. Hence, X is a vertex of both. Then, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. Wait, but XZ is a side? Wait, the problem says: "The sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X."

Wait, so the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. So, XY is a side of the square (since square has side XY), and XZ is a side of the pentagon? Or is XZ a new side?

Wait, in the pentagon, the vertices are A, B, C, D, X. So, the pentagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DX, XA. So, the side from D to X is DX, and from X to A is XA. So, if X is a vertex of the pentagon, then X is connected to D and A. Hence, XZ would imply a side from X to Z, but Z is not part of the pentagon. Wait, this is confusing. Perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, the original problem states:

Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z) — so the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. Square(B,C,Y,X) — vertices B, C, Y, X. So, the square and pentagon share vertices B and C. But the problem says they share a mutual vertex X. So, X must be one of B, C, or another vertex. If X is a vertex of both, then X must be B or C. But then, if X is B, the square would be B, C, Y, B, which is impossible. Same for C. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the initial assumptions, or perhaps the label X refers to a different vertex. 

Wait, perhaps the square is B, C, Y, X, and the pentagon is A, B, C, D, X. Hence, X is a vertex of both. So, the square has vertices B, C, Y, X, and the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, X. Hence, they share vertex X. This makes sense. So, in this case, X is a vertex of both the square and the pentagon. Hence, the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, X, and the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. 

With this setup, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. Wait, but XZ is a side. Where is Z? In the pentagon, the vertices are A, B, C, D, X. So, Z must be one of these points. Wait, the pentagon is named as A,B,C,D,Z. So, Z is the fifth vertex. Hence, if the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z, then Z is the fifth vertex. But earlier, we assumed that the pentagon's fifth vertex is X. So, there's a conflict here. This indicates a possible error in the problem statement or in the interpretation.

Given the complexity, perhaps I should refer back to the original problem statement and the given constraints. Let me re-read the problem's constraints.

The given constraints include:

Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z)

Square(B,C,Y,X)

Regular(Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

Regular(Square(B,C,Y,X))

IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(B,C), Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(C,D), Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(D,Z), Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(Z,A), Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(B,C), Square(B,C,Y,X))

IsSideOf(Line(C,Y), Square(B,C,Y,X))

IsSideOf(Line(Y,X), Square(B,C,Y,X))

IsSide Of(Line(X,B), Square(B,C,Y,X))

Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(B,C))

Congruent(Line(B,C), Line(C,D))

Congruent(Line(C,D), Line(D,Z))

Congruent(Line(D,Z), Line(Z,A))

Congruent(Line(B,C), Line(C,Y))

Congruent(Line(C,Y), Line(Y,X))

Congruent(Line(Y,X), Line(X,B))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), 108)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 108)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,Z)), 108)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,Z,A)), 108)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,A,B)), 108)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,Y)), 90)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,Y,X)), 90)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,B)), 90)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,B,C)), 90)

IsSideOf(Line(X,Y), Polygon(X,Y,Z))

IsSideOf(Line(X,Z), Polygon(X,Y,Z))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,C)),90)

So from this, the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. The square is B, C, Y, X. So, X is a vertex of the square. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So, X is not part of the pentagon, unless Z is X. But the problem says the square and pentagon share a mutual vertex X, so X must be a vertex of both. Hence, X must be one of the pentagon's vertices. Hence, X is Z. Therefore, the square is B, C, Y, Z, and the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. Hence, Z is the shared vertex X. So, in this case, X is Z.

Therefore, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, which are XY and XZ. But since X is Z, XZ is from Z to Z? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if X is Z, then XZ is from Z to Z? No, that's not possible. Hence, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, the problem says: "The sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X." So, XY and XZ are sides of the third polygon. Hence, X is a vertex of this polygon, and XY and XZ are its sides. So, the third polygon has two sides: one from X to Y, and one from X to Z. Hence, Y and Z are other vertices of the polygon. But Y is part of the square, and Z is part of the pentagon. Hence, the third polygon has vertices X, Y, and Z, but since it's a regular polygon, it must have more vertices.

But how to determine the number of sides?

To find the angle at X between XY and XZ, which is the internal angle of the regular polygon. Once we find this angle, we can determine the number of sides.

Let me try again to calculate this angle. Assume that X is Z, so the square is B, C, Y, Z, and the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So, Z is the shared vertex. Now, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ (i.e., XZ is from X (Z) to Z? No, that's not possible. Wait, if X is Z, then XZ is from Z to Z? No. This suggests that X is not Z. Hence, there must be a different approach.

Maybe I should forget about coordinates and focus on angles. Let's consider the angle between XY and XZ at point X.

In the square, the angle at X is 90 degrees between XY and XB. In the pentagon, the angle at Z (assuming Z is connected to D and A) is 108 degrees. But how does X relate to Z?

Wait, the problem states that the square has vertices B, C, Y, X. So, from X, the square has sides XY and XB. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So, Z is connected to D and A. But how is X connected to Z? The problem says that XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon. So, X is connected to Y and Z. Hence, X is connected to Y (part of square) and Z (part of pentagon). So, the angle between XY and XZ at X is the angle between the square's side XY and the pentagon's side XZ. This angle is what determines the internal angle of the third polygon.

To find this angle, we need to determine the angle between XY and XZ. Let's consider the angles from the square and pentagon.

In the square, at point X, the angle between XB and XY is 90 degrees. Let's call this angle ∠BXY = 90 degrees.

In the pentagon, at point Z, the angle between DZ and ZA is 108 degrees. But how does this relate to XZ?

Wait, if X is connected to Z, then we need to find the angle at X between XY (from square) and XZ (to pentagon). To find this, we need to determine the directions of XY and XZ.

Let me consider the square and pentagon's orientations.

Let me assume that the square BCYX is positioned such that BC is horizontal. Let me define the square with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), Y at (1,1), and X at (0,1). So, this forms a square with side length 1.

The pentagon is ABCDZ, which is regular. Let's assume it shares the side BC with the square. So, points B(0,0) and C(1,0) are part of both the square and the pentagon. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. Let's try to determine the coordinates of D and Z.

As before, from point C(1,0), the next side of the pentagon is CD. Since the pentagon is regular, each internal angle is 108 degrees. The direction from B to C is along the positive x-axis. At point C, the internal angle is 108 degrees. The direction from C to D will be at an angle of 180 - 108 = 72 degrees from the previous direction (since the internal angle is the angle between BC and CD). Wait, the direction from B to C is along the positive x-axis. At point C, the internal angle is 108 degrees, so the direction from C to D will be at an angle of 180 - 108 = 72 degrees from the extension of BC. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me use vector math.

The vector BC is (1,0) - (0,0) = (1,0). The next side CD has to form an internal angle of 108 degrees at C. The direction of CD can be determined by rotating the vector CB (which is (-1,0)) by 108 degrees clockwise (assuming the pentagon is oriented counterclockwise). Wait, if the pentagon is counterclockwise, then at each vertex, the turn is to the left by the external angle. The external angle for a regular pentagon is 72 degrees. So, from BC to CD, the direction changes by 72 degrees to the left.

The direction of BC is along positive x-axis. Turning left by 72 degrees gives a new direction of 72 degrees from the x-axis. So, the vector CD is in the direction of 72 degrees. The length of CD is 1 (same as BC). So, coordinates of D are C + (cos(72°), sin(72°)).

Cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. So, D is at (1 + 0.3090, 0 + 0.9511) ≈ (1.3090, 0.9511).

Next, from D, the next side is DZ. The direction from C to D is 72 degrees. The external angle is 72 degrees, so the direction from D to Z is 72 + 72 = 144 degrees from the x-axis. So, vector DZ is in direction 144 degrees, length 1. Coordinates of Z are D + (cos(144°), sin(144°)).

Cos(144°) = cos(180-36) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090, sin(144°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878. So, Z is at (1.3090 - 0.8090, 0.9511 + 0.5878) ≈ (0.5, 1.5389).

Now, from Z, the next side is ZA. Direction from D to Z is 144 degrees. External angle 72 degrees, so direction from Z to A is 144 + 72 = 216 degrees. Vector ZA is in direction 216 degrees, length 1. Coordinates of A are Z + (cos(216°), sin(216°)).

Cos(216°) = cos(180+36) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090, sin(216°) = -sin(36°) ≈ -0.5878. So, A is at (0.5 - 0.8090, 1.5389 - 0.5878) ≈ (-0.3090, 0.9511).

Now, we have point X at (0,1) from the square. We need to find the angle at X between XY and XZ.

Point Y is at (1,1). Point Z is at (0.5, 1.5389). So, vectors from X(0,1) to Y(1,1) is (1,0), and from X(0,1) to Z(0.5, 1.5389) is (0.5, 0.5389).

The angle between these vectors is the angle between (1,0) and (0.5, 0.5389). Using the dot product:

cosθ = (1*0.5 + 0*0.5389) / (|v||w|) = 0.5 / (1 * sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5389^2)).

Calculate denominator: sqrt(0.25 + 0.2903) = sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735.

So cosθ ≈ 0.5 / 0.735 ≈ 0.679.

θ ≈ arccos(0.679) ≈ 47.2 degrees.

This is the internal angle of the third regular polygon. For a regular polygon with n sides, the internal angle is ((n-2)/n)*180 degrees. Setting this equal to 47.2 degrees:

((n-2)/n)*180 = 47.2

Multiply both sides by n:

(n-2)*180 = 47.2n

Expand:

180n - 360 = 47.2n

Subtract 47.2n from both sides:

180n - 47.2n - 360 = 0

132.8n = 360

n = 360 / 132.8 ≈ 2.712

Wait, this gives n ≈ 2.712, which is impossible because a polygon must have at least 3 sides. Clearly, there's a mistake here.

But this suggests that the internal angle is too small for a regular polygon, which indicates an error in the calculation. Where is the mistake?

Wait, the angle calculated is between vectors XY and XZ, but this might not be the internal angle of the third polygon. Wait, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, so the angle between them at X is the internal angle. But if this angle is 47.2 degrees, then the formula gives n ≈ 2.71, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in the calculation.

Let me double-check the calculation of the angle. Let's recalculate the vectors.

Vector XY is from X(0,1) to Y(1,1): (1,0).

Vector XZ is from X(0,1) to Z(0.5, 1.5389): (0.5, 0.5389).

Dot product: 1*0.5 + 0*0.5389 = 0.5.

Magnitude of XY: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1.

Magnitude of XZ: sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5389^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.2903) = sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735.

So cosθ = 0.5 / 0.735 ≈ 0.679.

Now, arccos(0.679) is approximately 47.2 degrees. But this leads to an impossible n. Hence, there must be a mistake in the assumption that this angle is the internal angle. Perhaps it's the external angle?

Wait, no. The angle between XY and XZ at X is the internal angle of the third polygon. If it were the external angle, then it would be 180 - internal angle. But even so, let's try.

If the angle is 47.2 degrees, and it were the external angle, then the internal angle would be 180 - 47.2 = 132.8 degrees.

Using the formula:

((n-2)/n)*180 = 132.8

Multiply both sides by n:

(n-2)*180 = 132.8n

180n - 360 = 132.8n

180n - 132.8n = 360

47.2n = 360

n = 360 / 47.2 ≈ 7.62. Still not an integer. Not possible.

Hmm, this suggests that there's a fundamental error in the approach. Let me think differently.

Maybe the angle between XY and XZ is not the internal angle of the third polygon, but rather the angle between two sides, which could be the internal or external angle depending on the polygon's orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between XY and XZ is supplementary to the internal angle. Let me reconsider.

Suppose the third polygon is regular, and has sides XY and XZ. The angle at X between these sides is the internal angle of the polygon. But if the calculation shows this angle is 47.2 degrees, which is too small, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the coordinates.

Let me check the coordinates again. Point Z is at (0.5, 1.5389). Point X is at (0,1). So, vector XZ is (0.5 - 0, 1.5389 - 1) = (0.5, 0.5389). The angle between this vector and the x-axis is arctan(0.5389 / 0.5) = arctan(1.0778) ≈ 47.2 degrees. So the angle between XY (along x-axis) and XZ is 47.2 degrees. This is the angle at X between the two sides of the third polygon. Hence, it should be the internal angle.

But this leads to an impossible n. This suggests that there's an error in the assumption that the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. Or perhaps the angle is not the internal angle, but the external angle?

Wait, let's think about the regular polygon. If the internal angle is α, then the external angle is 180 - α. But in a regular polygon, the sum of the external angles is 360 degrees, and each external angle is 360/n. So, if the angle we calculated is the external angle, then 360/n = 47.2 degrees, giving n = 360 / 47.2 ≈ 7.62, still not integer.

Alternatively, if the angle is the internal angle, then ((n-2)/n)*180 = 47.2. Solving for n:

(n-2)/n = 47.2/180 ≈ 0.2622

1 - 2/n = 0.2622

2/n = 1 - 0.2622 = 0.7378

n = 2 / 0.7378 ≈ 2.71, which is still impossible.

This suggests that there is a mistake in the calculation of the angle. Let me check the coordinates again.

Wait, in the pentagon, point Z is at (0.5, 1.5389). Point X is at (0,1). So, the vector XZ is from X(0,1) to Z(0.5, 1.5389), which is (0.5, 0.5389). The length of this vector is sqrt(0.5² + 0.5389²) ≈ sqrt(0.25 + 0.2903) = sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735. But in a regular polygon, all sides are equal. If XY is a side of the square, which has length 1, and XZ is a side of the third polygon, then XZ must also have length 1. But in our calculation, it's 0.735, which is inconsistent. This suggests that the assumption of the square and pentagon having side length 1 is incorrect, and their sides are not congruent. But the problem states that Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)), which means AB is congruent to BC. Since AB is a side of the pentagon and BC is a side of the square, this implies that all sides of the square and pentagon are congruent. Hence, XY (side of square) and XZ (side of third polygon) must be congruent. But in our calculation, XZ is shorter than XY, indicating a contradiction.

This suggests that the error lies in the assumption of the square and pentagon having side length 1. Instead, the side lengths are not fixed; they are congruent, but their actual length depends on the configuration. However, in our coordinate system, we forced BC to be length 1, leading to inconsistencies. To resolve this, we need to ensure that XY and XZ are of equal length. Let's try to scale the coordinates appropriately.

Let me denote the length of BC (and hence all sides of the square and pentagon) as s. In the square, XY is length s. In the pentagon, XZ is a diagonal or some line, but in our case, XZ is a side of the third polygon, so it should also be length s. However, in our previous calculation, XZ was shorter than s. This suggests that the coordinates need to be adjusted to ensure XZ is length s.

Let me re-calculate the position of Z such that XZ is length s. Let's assume BC has length s, so B is at (0,0), C is at (s, 0). Then, the square BCYX has Y at (s, s) and X at (0, s). The pentagon ABCDZ has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. Let's calculate D and Z such that all sides are length s.

From point C(s, 0), the next side CD is length s, forming an internal angle of 108 degrees at C. The direction from C to D is 72 degrees from the x-axis (as before). So, coordinates of D are (s + s*cos(72°), 0 + s*sin(72°)) = s*(1 + cos(72°), sin(72°)).

Similarly, from D, the direction to Z is 72 + 72 = 144 degrees from x-axis, so Z is at D + s*(cos(144°), sin(144°)).

Coordinates of Z: s*[1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°), sin(72°) + sin(144°)].

Now, the vector from X(0, s) to Z is (s*[1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°)] - 0, s*sin(72°) + s*sin(144°) - s).

Simplify:

XZ vector: (s[1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°)], s[sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1]).

The length of XZ should be s, so:

sqrt([s[1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°)]^2 + [s(sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1)]^2] = s

Divide both sides by s:

sqrt([1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°)]^2 + [sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1]^2) = 1

Let's compute this expression.

First, calculate 1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°):

cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, cos(144°) = cos(180-36) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090.

So 1 + 0.3090 - 0.8090 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Next, sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1:

sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511, sin(144°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878.

So 0.9511 + 0.5878 - 1 ≈ 1.5389 - 1 = 0.5389.

Now, the expression becomes sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5389^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.2903) = sqrt(0.5403) ≈ 0.735, which is not 1. Hence, the length of XZ is 0.735s, not s. This confirms the earlier issue. Hence, the length of XZ is less than s, which contradicts the requirement that XZ is a side of the third polygon, which should have the same length as XY (s). This suggests that the third polygon cannot have sides of length s, which implies that the initial assumptions are incorrect.

This contradiction suggests that the third polygon is not a regular polygon with sides XY and XZ, but perhaps it has sides of length equal to the square's side, requiring adjustment of the configuration. Alternatively, there might be a different relationship between the angles.

Let me try to find the angle between XY and XZ using the exact trigonometric values, without approximations.

We have:

From earlier, the vector XZ is (0.5, 0.5389) when s=1. The exact value of 0.5389 is sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1, but let's calculate it precisely.

Wait, in the general case with s=1, the coordinates of Z are:

x = 1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°) = 1 + cos(72°) + cos(144°)

y = sin(72°) + sin(144°) - 1

But let's calculate these terms exactly.

Note that 72° and 144° are related to the regular pentagon. Let's use exact values.

Cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2? Wait, exact value of cos(72°) is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, or more accurately, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2. Let me recall that cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 * 0.5? Wait, let me recall that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, and cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2.

Actually, exact value of cos(72°) is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, which simplifies to (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Wait, no. Let me recall that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is (1 + √5)/4 * 2 = (1 + √5)/2 * 0.5? No, let me look up exact values.

Exact value of cos(72°) is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2. Wait, no. Actually, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2 is incorrect. Let me recall that cos(72°) = 2cos²(36°) - 1, but this might not help.

Alternatively, using exact trigonometric identities:

cos(72°) = 2cos²(36°) - 1, but this might not help here
