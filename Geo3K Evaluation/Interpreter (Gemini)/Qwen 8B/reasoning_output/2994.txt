====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how to find the value of x. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints and see which ones can help me form equations.

We have a circle A with points B, C, D, E, H involved. There are several lines mentioned: BC, CH, BE, AD, AE, AH. Also, there are tangents, secants, and some perpendicularity conditions. Plus, certain lengths are equal or related through expressions involving x.

First, let me note down all the key pieces:

- Circle(A) has points D, E, H on it because they lie on the circle (PointLiesOnCircle). So D, E, H are points on the circumference of circle A.

- Lines BC, CH, BE, AD, AE, AH are constructed. 

- Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(A)) means line BC is tangent to the circle at point D? Wait, but PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C)). So point D lies on line BC. And since D is on the circle, then line BC is tangent to the circle at D. Similarly, line CH is tangent to the circle at H, since H is on line CH and on the circle. 

Wait, the tangent condition for Line(B,C): Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(A)) implies that line BC touches the circle at exactly one point. But we also know that D lies on line BC and D is on the circle. Therefore, line BC is tangent at D. Similarly, line CH is tangent at H, so line CH touches the circle only at H. 

Also, Line(B,E) is a secant of the circle. Since points E is on the circle and on line BE. So line BE passes through E, which is on the circle, meaning that line BE intersects the circle at E and possibly another point? Or maybe just E? Wait, but if it's a secant, then it should intersect the circle at two points. However, since E is on the circle and on line BE, perhaps line BE starts at B and goes through E, which is on the circle. If E is one intersection point, then maybe there's another? But maybe not necessarily. Wait, the problem says "secant(Line(B,E), Circle(A))", so the line BE is a secant, implying it intersects the circle at two points. But since E is already on the circle, there must be another point. But where?

But wait, maybe E is one endpoint of the secant? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line BE passes through another point on the circle. However, since E is on the circle, and line BE connects B to E, which is on the circle. So unless B is outside the circle, the line BE would pass through E and maybe another point. But since B isn't necessarily on the circle. Let me check if B is on the circle. The problem mentions Point(A) as a circle, but points B, C, D, E, H are separate points. So B might not be on the circle.

Now, moving on to the other constraints:

- Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)): So line AD is perpendicular to line BC. Since line BC is tangent at D, and AD is a radius? Because AD is connected to the center A? Wait, hold on. The circle is called Circle(A). In standard notation, Circle(A) usually refers to a circle with center at point A. So the center of the circle is point A. That makes sense. So point A is the center of the circle. Therefore, lines AD, AE, AH are radii of the circle, since they connect the center A to points D, E, H on the circle. Therefore, AD, AE, AH are radii, each of length equal to the radius of the circle.

Therefore, AD = AE = AH = radius. Given that IsRadiusOf(Line(A,D), Circle(A)) etc., confirming that these lines are radii.

So, since AD is a radius, and line BC is tangent at D, then AD is perpendicular to BC. Which matches the given Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)). That checks out.

Similarly, line CH is tangent at H, so AH is perpendicular to line CH. So AH ⊥ CH. But line CH is part of the construction; H is on line CH and on the circle. So AH is a radius, and line CH is tangent at H, hence AH ⊥ CH.

Now, looking at the lengths:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 41): AB = 41 units.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 39): BD = 39.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), Sub(72, Mul(3,x))): CD = 72 - 3x.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,H)), Sub(Mul(5,x),8)): CH = 5x - 8.

- Congruent(Line(A,D), Line(A,E)): AD = AE, which we already knew since they're both radii. So this confirms that AD = AE, which is consistent.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,H)), LengthOf(Line(C,D))): So CH = CD. Hence, 5x - 8 = 72 - 3x. Wait, that seems like a direct equation. Solving that would give us x. But wait, let me check if that's valid. Let me confirm whether CH equals CD.

Yes, the last constraint says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,H)), LengthOf(Line(C,D))). Therefore, CH = CD. So substituting their expressions:

CH = 5x - 8,

CD = 72 - 3x.

Set them equal:

5x - 8 = 72 - 3x.

Adding 3x to both sides: 8x - 8 = 72.

Adding 8 to both sides: 8x = 80 => x = 10. Wait, so x=10? Then why is there an option A.10? But let me make sure that this is correct. However, there might be more constraints here, so maybe I need to verify if this is sufficient or if there are other relations that affect x. Let me think again.

Wait, but before jumping to conclusion, perhaps there are other constraints that need to be considered. For example, triangle relationships, power of a point, Pythagorean theorem, etc. Maybe I need to check if my assumption that CH = CD directly gives x=10 is valid, or if there's something else.

Let me re-examine the problem. The user says "Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent." So line BC is tangent at D, line CH is tangent at H. Also, line BE is a secant. Points D, E, H are on the circle. Also, AD, AE, AH are radii. Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally.

Since AD is perpendicular to BC (because BC is tangent at D), and AD is a radius. Also, AB is 41, BD is 39. So triangle ABD has AB=41, BD=39, and AD is a radius. Let me consider triangle ABD. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and D is on BC. Let me imagine right triangle ABD where angle at D is right angle. Wait, no. AD is perpendicular to BC, so AD is perpendicular to BC, so AD is the altitude from A to BC. Wait, but D is on BC. Therefore, AD is the altitude from A to BC. But since AD is also a radius, and D is on the circle. So, in this case, triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at D. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

AB² = AD² + BD²

Because AD is perpendicular to BD (since AD is perpendicular to BC, and BD is along BC).

So AB² = AD² + BD².

Given AB=41, BD=39. Therefore:

41² = AD² + 39².

Calculating 41²: 1681, 39²: 1521.

Thus, AD² = 1681 - 1521 = 160. Therefore, AD = sqrt(160) = 4*sqrt(10) ≈ 12.649...

But AD is a radius of the circle. So radius r = AD = sqrt(160). Now, let me check if this helps in finding x. Also, since CD = 72 - 3x, and CH = 5x -8, and we had set them equal to get x=10. But maybe there's another relation involving CD or CH with other elements?

Alternatively, since line CH is tangent to the circle at H, then using power of a point. The power of point C with respect to circle A is equal to the square of the tangent segment from C to the circle. Since line CH is tangent at H, then power of C is CH². But power of point C can also be expressed as CB * CD, if line CB intersects the circle at B and D? Wait, but earlier, line BC is tangent at D, so the power of point C with respect to circle A is equal to CD² (since it's tangent). Wait, but if line CB is tangent at D, then power of point C is CD². But also, if there's another line from C passing through the circle, say line CE? Wait, but point E is on the circle. Wait, line BE is a secant. Let me think about that.

Wait, line BE passes through E, which is on the circle. So maybe line BE intersects the circle at E and another point? But since E is on the circle, and B is outside? Not sure yet. But let's think about power of point C with respect to circle A. Since line CH is tangent at H, power of C is CH². Also, line CB is tangent at D, so power of C is CD². Therefore, CH² = CD². Therefore, CH = CD, which is given as Equal(LengthOf(Line(C,H)), LengthOf(Line(C,D))), so that's consistent. Therefore, our previous equation CH = CD gives 5x -8 = 72 -3x leading to x=10. But then why does the problem include other data? Because maybe there's a mistake in assuming that CH^2 = CD^2? Wait, no. Power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the tangent length. Since line CB is tangent at D, so power of C is CD². Similarly, line CH is tangent at H, so power of C is CH². Therefore, CD² = CH², which implies CD = CH (since lengths are positive). Therefore, the equation 5x -8 = 72 -3x is correct. Solving gives x=10. So that would suggest answer A. But let me check if there are other constraints that may affect this.

Wait, but there's also the line BE being a secant. Let me consider that. Since line BE passes through E, which is on the circle. If B is outside the circle, then line BE would intersect the circle at E and another point. Let me denote that other point as F. Then power of point B with respect to circle A is equal to BF * BE. But we don't know much about BF or BE. However, we do know that AB = 41, and AE is a radius. Let me compute AE. Earlier, we found AD = sqrt(160). Since AE is also a radius, AE = sqrt(160). Therefore, AE = AD = sqrt(160). So AE is the radius. Let me look at triangle ABE. We know AB = 41, AE = sqrt(160), and BE is a secant. But without knowing more points, maybe we can use power of point B.

Power of point B with respect to circle A is equal to BT² where BT is the length of the tangent from B to the circle. Since line BC is tangent at D, so BD is the tangent segment. Wait, BD is the tangent from B to the circle. Therefore, power of B is BD² = 39² = 1521.

But also, power of B can be expressed as BE * BF, where BE and BF are the lengths from B to the points where line BE intersects the circle. Since E is one point, and suppose the other intersection is, say, G. So BE * BG = BD².

But we don't know BG. However, if line BE passes through E and maybe another point. But since E is on the circle, then if line BE starts at B, goes through E, which is on the circle, then BE is a tangent? No, because it's stated as a secant, so it must pass through two points. Wait, but if E is on the circle, then line BE starts at B, passes through E (on the circle), so it's a secant if it passes through another point. Unless E is the only intersection. Wait, but a secant requires two intersections. Therefore, line BE must intersect the circle at two points. Since E is one, there must be another. Let me call that other point, say, F. So BE * BF = BD² = 1521.

But unless we know more about the positions of these points, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps there's another way. Let me check if point E is connected to other points. We know that E is on the circle, and line AE is a radius. Also, line AE is connected to point E, and line BE is connected to E. Also, line AE is a radius, so AE = radius = sqrt(160). Also, AB is 41. So in triangle ABE, we have AB = 41, AE = sqrt(160), and BE is a side. But unless we can find BE, maybe via coordinates or other relations.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) since it's the center of the circle. Then points D, E, H lie on the circle centered at A. Let me assign coordinates based on known info.

Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and AD is a radius. Let me assume coordinates such that line BC is horizontal or vertical for simplicity. Since AD is perpendicular to BC. Let me take line BC as horizontal. Then AD is vertical. Let me define coordinates accordingly.

Let me suppose that point D is at (d_x, d_y). Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and AD is a radius. Let me assume that line BC is horizontal. Therefore, AD is vertical. Therefore, if AD is vertical, then point D lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through A. Wait, but A is the center. Suppose A is at (0,0). Then line AD is vertical, so D lies along the y-axis. Therefore, coordinates of D are (0, k) for some k. Since AD is a radius, its length is |k|, so radius r = |k|. Also, since line BC is tangent at D, which is (0,k). Therefore, line BC is horizontal (perpendicular to AD, which is vertical). Thus, line BC is horizontal, passing through D. Since D is on BC, which is horizontal, and line BC is tangent at D, so BC touches the circle only at D.

Coordinates of D: (0, k). Then line BC is horizontal, so it has equation y = k. Points B and C are on this line. Also, point D is between B and C? Or could be extended?

But we have BD = 39. Let me suppose that point B is to the left of D, and point C is to the right of D, making BD = 39. Let me assign coordinates:

Let me let D be at (0, k). Then line BC is horizontal, so points B and C are on y = k. Let me suppose B is at (-b, k) and C is at (c, k), so that D is between them. Then BD distance is from B(-b, k) to D(0,k): distance is b. Given BD = 39, so b = 39. Therefore, coordinates of B: (-39, k). Coordinates of D: (0,k). Coordinates of C: (c, k). Then CD is the distance from C(c,k) to D(0,k), which is |c - 0| = |c|. But CD is given as 72 - 3x. So c = 72 - 3x (assuming c positive, since C is to the right of D). Therefore, coordinates of C: (72 - 3x, k).

Now, AB is given as 41. Point A is at (0,0), point B is at (-39, k). So distance AB is sqrt[ (-39 - 0)^2 + (k - 0)^2 ] = sqrt(39² + k²) = 41. Therefore:

sqrt(39² + k²) = 41 → 39² + k² = 41² → k² = 41² - 39² = (41-39)(41+39) = 2*80 = 160 → k = sqrt(160) = 4√10 ≈ 12.649.

So coordinates of D: (0, 4√10). Coordinates of B: (-39, 4√10). Coordinates of C: (72 - 3x, 4√10).

Now, we also have line CH is tangent to the circle at H, so similar logic applies. Let me consider line CH. Since AH is a radius and is perpendicular to line CH. Let me find coordinates for H.

Since line CH is tangent at H, so AH is perpendicular to CH. Let me denote point H as lying on the circle, so its coordinates satisfy the circle equation x² + y² = r² = 160 (since radius squared is 160). Also, line CH passes through C and H, and is perpendicular to AH.

Let me find coordinates of H. Let me denote coordinates of H as (h_x, h_y). Since AH is perpendicular to CH. Vector AH is (h_x, h_y). Vector CH is (h_x - C_x, h_y - C_y). Since AH · CH = 0 (dot product zero because perpendicular).

So:

(h_x)(h_x - C_x) + (h_y)(h_y - C_y) = 0.

Expanding:

h_x² - C_x h_x + h_y² - C_y h_y = 0.

But since H lies on the circle, h_x² + h_y² = r² = 160. Substitute into above:

160 - C_x h_x - C_y h_y = 0 → C_x h_x + C_y h_y = 160.

Additionally, since H lies on line CH. Let me parametrize line CH. Since point C is (C_x, C_y) = (72 - 3x, 4√10). Let me denote C_x = 72 - 3x and C_y = 4√10.

Parametric equations for line CH: starting at C, going towards H. Let me write parametrically as:

For parameter t, points on line CH are (C_x + t*(H_x - C_x), C_y + t*(H_y - C_y)).

But H lies on this line, so when t=1, we reach H. But since H is on the circle, and line CH is tangent at H, then H is the only intersection point. Also, since line CH is tangent, and AH is perpendicular to CH, we can use the fact that AH is perpendicular to CH.

Alternatively, since line CH is tangent at H, then vector AH is perpendicular to direction vector of line CH. Direction vector of line CH is (H_x - C_x, H_y - C_y). So the dot product of AH and direction vector is zero:

AH ⋅ (H - C) = 0 → (H_x, H_y) ⋅ (H_x - C_x, H_y - C_y) = 0.

Which expands to:

H_x² - C_x H_x + H_y² - C_y H_y = 0.

As before, and since H_x² + H_y² = 160, this becomes:

160 - C_x H_x - C_y H_y = 0 → C_x H_x + C_y H_y = 160.

This is the same equation as before.

Additionally, H lies on line CH. So parametric equations. Let me express H as a point on line CH. Let me write line CH in terms of slope. Let me find the slope of line CH. Since AH is perpendicular to CH, and AH has slope (H_y - 0)/(H_x - 0) = H_y / H_x. Therefore, slope of CH is -H_x / H_y.

But line CH passes through point C (C_x, C_y). Therefore, equation of line CH is:

(y - C_y) = m (x - C_x), where m = -H_x / H_y.

But H lies on this line. So substituting H_x and H_y into this equation:

H_y - C_y = (-H_x / H_y)(H_x - C_x)

Multiply both sides by H_y:

H_y² - C_y H_y = -H_x (H_x - C_x )

Rearranged:

H_x² - C_x H_x + H_y² - C_y H_y = 0.

Which is the same equation as before. So we still have the same condition.

But this seems complex. Perhaps instead of solving for H, we can use the fact that CH is tangent, so power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CH², which is equal to CD² as well. Wait, earlier we established that power of C is CD² (from tangent BC) and CH² (from tangent CH), hence CD² = CH² ⇒ CD = CH. Which leads us back to 5x -8 = 72 -3x ⇒ x=10. But maybe there's more constraints. Wait, but according to the problem statement, line BE is a secant. Let me check if that adds more constraints.

Line BE passes through E, which is on the circle. Since E is on the circle, and AE is a radius. Let me find coordinates of E. Since E is on the circle, coordinates of E satisfy x_E² + y_E² = 160. Also, line BE connects B(-39, 4√10) to E(x_E, y_E). Also, since line BE is a secant, it must intersect the circle at two points. One is E, the other could be another point. But since E is already on the circle, maybe there's another intersection. Let me calculate power of point B with respect to circle A, which is equal to BE * BF, where F is the second intersection point.

Power of B is BD² = 39² = 1521.

So BE * BF = 1521.

If we can find BE, we can relate it to BF. But without knowing more about E, it's difficult. However, since E is on the circle and AE is a radius, we can find coordinates of E. Wait, but we don't know where E is located. However, there's another constraint: line AE is a radius, so AE is from A(0,0) to E(x_E, y_E), which is a radius. Also, point E lies on line BE. Let me try to find coordinates of E.

Let me parametrize line BE. Point B is at (-39, 4√10). Let me assume that E is some point on line BE, which also lies on the circle. Let me denote parametric equations for line BE. Let me define parameter t such that when t=0, we are at B, and t=1, we are at E. Wait, but E is another point. Alternatively, since E is on the circle, and line BE passes through E, which is on the circle. So E is a point on both line BE and the circle.

Let me find coordinates of E. Let me suppose that E is (e_x, e_y). It satisfies:

(e_x)^2 + (e_y)^2 = 160.

And it lies on line BE. The line BE passes through B(-39, 4√10) and E(e_x, e_y). So the parametric equations for line BE can be written as:

x = -39 + t*(e_x + 39),

y = 4√10 + t*(e_y - 4√10),

for t ∈ R.

But since E is on this line, when t=1, we reach E. However, since E is on the circle, we can substitute into the circle equation. But without knowing e_x and e_y, this might not help directly. However, since AE is a radius, and E is on the circle, AE has length sqrt(e_x² + e_y²) = sqrt(160). Also, line AE connects A(0,0) to E(e_x, e_y). So vector AE is (e_x, e_y). Also, line BE connects B(-39, 4√10) to E(e_x, e_y). 

Perhaps there's another relationship. Since line AE is a radius and line AD is another radius. Are there any angles or triangles we can consider?

Alternatively, since we already have x derived from CD = CH giving x=10, and that seems straightforward, but why is there an option A (10)? However, let me check if there are other constraints that might invalidate this solution. For instance, maybe CD and CH aren't just equal in length, but also other relations due to triangle congruence or other theorems. Let me check with x=10.

If x=10, then CD = 72 - 3x = 72 - 30 = 42. CH = 5x -8 = 50 -8 = 42. So CD=CH=42. This fits. So that seems okay. But let me check if with x=10, other constraints are satisfied.

But what about point E? How does it fit in? Let me think. If x=10, then CD=42, which is the length from C to D. Since C is at (72 -3x, 4√10) = (72 -30, 4√10)= (42, 4√10). Wait, earlier, I defined C_x = 72 -3x, and since x=10, C_x=42. So point C is at (42, 4√10). Then point D is at (0,4√10). So CD is the distance from (42, 4√10) to (0,4√10) which is 42 units. Correct. And CH is 42, so line CH has length 42. Since point H is on the circle, and line CH is tangent at H, then CH is tangent from point C to circle, length 42. Also, power of point C is CD² = 42² = 1764. Which should equal CH² = 42², which holds. So that's consistent.

Now, what about line BE? Let me see. We have AB=41, and AE is radius sqrt(160). Let me calculate BE. If I can find BE, then using power of point B, BE * BF = 1521. But since E is on the circle, and BE is a secant, then if E is one intersection, and F is another, then BE * BF = BD² = 1521. But without knowing F, it's tricky. However, if line BE passes through E and another point, say, F, then BF = BE + EF if E is between B and F, or vice versa. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to tell. However, maybe there's another relation.

But since E is on the circle and on line BE, and AE is a radius. Let me try to find coordinates of E. Let me consider that line AE is from A(0,0) to E(e_x, e_y), which is a radius. Also, E lies on line BE. Let me parametrize line BE. Let me write parametric equations for line BE. Point B is (-39, 4√10). Let me assume that E is a point on line BE such that AE is a radius. Let me write parametric equations for line BE:

Any point on line BE can be expressed as B + t*(E - B). Wait, but since E is unknown, maybe better to use variables.

Alternatively, since E lies on line BE and on the circle. Let me write the equation of line BE. Let me find the equation of line BE. To do that, I need coordinates of B and E. But I don't know E. However, I know that AE is a radius, so E lies on the circle. Let me suppose that E is (p, q), satisfying p² + q² = 160. And E lies on line BE. Let me write the equation of line BE passing through B(-39, 4√10) and E(p, q). The slope of BE is (q - 4√10)/(p + 39). Equation of line BE: y - 4√10 = [(q - 4√10)/(p + 39)](x + 39). Since E(p,q) lies on this line, substituting x=p, y=q gives:

q - 4√10 = [(q - 4√10)/(p + 39)](p + 39) → q - 4√10 = q - 4√10, which is always true. So that doesn't help. Need another condition.

But also, since E is on line BE, and line BE is a secant, but we don't have enough info. Perhaps there's another relation. Wait, since line AE is a radius, and E is on the circle. Also, line AE connects A(0,0) to E(p,q). What is the relation between line AE and other elements?

Alternatively, since we have point E on the circle, and line BE passes through E, and we know AB=41, AE=sqrt(160), and BE is a secant. Maybe applying the Law of Cosines on triangle ABE?

In triangle ABE, we have sides AB=41, AE=sqrt(160), and BE. Let me denote angle at A between AB and AE. But without knowing the angle, it's hard to apply directly. However, if we can find BE, we can use the power of point B.

Alternatively, let me consider that the power of point B is BE * BF = BD² = 39² = 1521. If I can find BE, then BF = 1521 / BE. But since E is on the circle, and F is another intersection point, then BE and BF depend on the position of E.

But without additional information, it's challenging. However, since we've already solved x=10 from the condition CD=CH, and that seems to fit all the constraints, maybe this is the correct answer. Let me check if with x=10, everything is consistent.

Another thing to check: the coordinates of point C are (42, 4√10). Then line CH is tangent at H, and length CH=42. Since point C is at (42, 4√10), and line CH is tangent to the circle at H. The length of tangent from C to the circle is CH=42. But the power of point C is also equal to CD² = 42² = 1764. So that's consistent. Therefore, CH=42, which matches 5x -8=42 when x=10. So that works.

Therefore, even though there are other elements in the problem, like line BE being a secant, those might not add new constraints because they are already accounted for by the existing conditions. Hence, the value x=10 is consistent with all given constraints.

But wait, let me check if there's any possibility that the initial assumption that CD=CH directly gives x=10 is wrong. For example, maybe CD and CH are not both tangents, but there's another relation. Wait, no. CD is along the tangent line BC, which is tangent at D, so CD is the tangent segment from C to the circle. Similarly, CH is the tangent segment from C to the circle at H. Hence, their lengths should be equal, so CD=CH. Hence, the equation 5x -8 =72 -3x is correct. Therefore, x=10.

But the answer choices include A.10, so that would be the answer. However, sometimes problems may have hidden constraints, but in this case, all given constraints seem to support x=10. Hence, the correct answer is A.

To determine the value of $ x $, we examine the geometric configuration described in the problem, focusing primarily on the relationships between the circle, tangent and secant lines, and the distances between points.

### **Key Observations and Constraints**

- **Circle A** has center at point $ A $, and the points $ D $, $ E $, and $ H $ lie on the circle, meaning they are equidistant from $ A $. Hence, $ AD = AE = AH $, and each represents a **radius** of the circle.

- **Lines**:
  - $ \text{Line}(B,C) $ is **tangent** at point $ D $, so $ AD \perp BC $
  - $ \text{Line}(C,H) $ is **tangent** at point $ H $, so $ AH \perp CH $
  - $ \text{Line}(B,E) $ is a **secant**, implying it intersects the circle at two points.
  
- **Important Distance Relationships**:
  - $ AB = 41 $
  - $ BD = 39 $
  - $ CD = 72 - 3x $
  - $ CH = 5x - 8 $

- **Equality Constraint**: 
  > $ \text{Length}(\overline{CH}) = \text{Length}(\overline{CD}) $

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

From the equality of lengths $ CD = CH $, we substitute the expressions:

$$
\text{Length}(\overline{CD}) = 72 - 3x \\
\text{Length}(\overline{CH}) = 5x - 8
$$

Equating the two:

$$
72 - 3x = 5x - 8
$$

Solving:

$$
72 + 8 = 5x + 3x \\
80 = 8x \\
x = 10
$$

### **Verification with Additional Constraints**

This value of $ x = 10 $ satisfies the equality of the tangent segments from point $ C $ to the circle, i.e., $ CD = CH $. Furthermore, the setup ensures consistency with the definition of power of a point with respect to the circle. All other constraints (such as right angles, distances, and circle properties) remain unaffected by this calculation and align with the given values.

---

### **Conclusion**

All derived constraints are consistent with $ x = 10 $, and no further contradictions arise from the given data.
