Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the measure of angle D here. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle, which means it's a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. Wait, so that means the sum of each pair of opposite angles should be 180 degrees. Let me check the given information again.

The problem states that angle A is 58 degrees. Then there are equations for angles B, C, D in terms of variables X and Y. Also, they mention that the sum of angle A and angle C is 180 degrees, and the sum of angle B and angle D is also 180 degrees. Hmm, okay. Let me note down these equations:

Given:
- Measure of Angle A = 58°
- Measure of Angle B = 3Y + 4
- Measure of Angle C = 2X
- Measure of Angle D = 2Y + 16
- Sum of A and C = 180°
- Sum of B and D = 180°

So first, since A + C = 180°, and A is 58°, then C must be 180° - 58° = 122°. Therefore, 2X = 122°, so X = 61°. That gives us X.

Now, moving on to angles B and D. Their sum is 180°, so (3Y + 4) + (2Y + 16) = 180. Let me compute that:

Combine like terms: 3Y + 2Y = 5Y; 4 + 16 = 20. So 5Y + 20 = 180. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5Y = 160. Divide by 5: Y = 32°.

Once we have Y, we can plug it into the expression for angle D. Angle D = 2Y + 16. Substituting Y=32: 2*32 +16 = 64 +16 = 80°. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If Y=32, then angle B would be 3*32 +4 = 96 +4 = 100°, and angle D is 80°, so their sum is 100+80=180°, which checks out. And angle C was 122°, which matches with 2X=122, so X=61. All seems consistent.

Therefore, the measure of angle D is 80°, which corresponds to option C. Let me check the answer choices again. The choices are A.58, B.64, C.80, D.82. So the correct answer should be C.80. But wait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me verify once more.

Another way: Since ABCD is cyclic, opposite angles are supplementary. So A + C = 180 and B + D = 180. Given A is 58, so C is 122. Then angles B and D add up to 180. From the expressions:

Angle B = 3Y +4, angle D=2Y +16. Adding them: 5Y +20=180 → 5Y=160 → Y=32. Thus D=2*32 +16= 64+16=80. Yep, same result. So answer is C.80. So Final Answer: C.
