MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the length of arc AB. Let's start by going through the given information step by step.

First, there's a circle O. Points A, B, D are mentioned. Line AD is a diameter of the circle because it's stated that Line(A,D) is a diameter of Circle(O). Also, points A and B lie on the circle since they're both on the circumference. Additionally, point D is also on the circle because it's part of the diameter. 

Wait, but if AD is a diameter, then points A and D are endpoints of the diameter. So OA and OD are radii. The problem says that OA and OB are radii. Wait, but line OA is a radius? Because it says IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Circle(O)). Similarly for OB. But since AD is a diameter, OA would be half of AD. Let me note that down.

Given that AD is a diameter, so its length is twice the radius. The problem states that the length of AD is 14. Therefore, the radius of the circle should be half of 14, which is 7. So OA = OB = 7 units each. That makes sense.

Now, angle AOB is given as 80 degrees. The question asks for the length of arc AB. I remember that the length of an arc is related to the central angle subtended by the arc. The formula for arc length is θ/360 multiplied by the circumference of the circle. Alternatively, using radians, it's rθ, but since the angle is given in degrees here, we'll use the first formula.

So first, let me confirm the circumference of the circle. Since the radius is 7, circumference C = 2πr = 2 * π * 7 ≈ 14π. However, the problem mentions that the circumference equals 3.14159 multiplied by the length of AD (which is 14). Let me check that. If AD is 14, then CircumferenceOf(Circle(O)) is equal to 3.14159 * 14. Let me compute that. 3.14159 * 14. Well, 3.14159 * 14 ≈ 43.98226. But the actual circumference with radius 7 would be 2 * π * 7 ≈ 14 * 3.14159... Wait, π is approximately 3.14159, so yes, 2πr when r=7 is 14π, which is about 43.982. So that checks out. So that's consistent.

Now, the arc length AB is given by the formula:

Arc length AB = (θ / 360) * Circumference

Where θ is the measure of angle AOB, which is 80 degrees. Therefore:

Arc AB = (80 / 360) * 14π

But wait, the problem also gives another equation: Equals(LengthOf(Arc(A,B)), Mul(CircumferenceOf(Circle(O)), Div(MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,B)),360))). Which is exactly the same as above. So substituting numbers:

Circumference is 14π (since AD is 14, and circumference is π*diameter, but wait hold on! Wait, earlier I thought circumference was 2πr, but since AD is the diameter, which is 14, then circumference is π*diameter. So π*14. So that matches the given equation where circumference is 3.14159 * 14. So yes.

Therefore, arc AB is (80/360)*circumference. Let me calculate that.

First, simplify 80/360. Divide numerator and denominator by 40: 2/9. So 2/9 of the circumference.

So arc length AB = (2/9) * 14π.

Let me compute that numerically. First, compute 14π. As before, π is approx 3.14159, so 14 * 3.14159 ≈ 43.98226.

Then multiply by 2/9: 43.98226 * (2/9). Let me do this calculation step by step.

First, divide 43.98226 by 9: 43.98226 ÷ 9 ≈ 4.886917...

Multiply by 2: 4.886917 * 2 ≈ 9.773834...

So the arc length AB is approximately 9.77 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Looking at the answer choices: option B is 9.77. So that seems like the correct answer.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Confirm that AD is diameter, so length is 14. Radius is 7. Correct.

2. Angle AOB is 80 degrees. Arc AB corresponds to this central angle. Correct.

3. Circumference is π*diameter = π*14 ≈ 43.982. Correct.

4. Arc length AB = (80/360)*circumference = (2/9)*14π ≈ 9.77. Yes.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly using radians?

The angle in radians would be θ_rad = 80° * (π/180) = (4π)/9 radians.

Arc length is r * θ_rad. So 7 * (4π/9) = 28π/9 ≈ ?

Calculate 28π divided by 9. π≈3.14159, so 28*3.14159 ≈ 87.96452. Then divide by 9: 87.96452 / 9 ≈ 9.7738... Same result. So again, ~9.77. So that confirms the answer is B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 9.77.
