MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given here. Let me go through them one by one.

First, it says that angle at point A (angle BAC) is a right angle. Wait, no—the Angle(B,A,C) means the angle at point A between points B and C. So that's angle BAC. But then it says RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), so that means angle BAC is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. 

Then, they mention that line AB is perpendicular to line AC. That makes sense because if the right angle is at A, then sides AB and AC would be perpendicular. Also, since it's a right triangle, the hypotenuse should be BC. Wait, but the constraint says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). So BC is the hypotenuse. That aligns with the right angle being at A because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So BC is the hypotenuse, meaning AB and AC are the legs.

Now, the lengths: Length of AC is given as 2. The length of AB is x, which we need to find. The length of BC is 5. Then there's an equation involving squares of the lengths. It says SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C))) equals Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(A,B))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(A,C)))). 

Wait, that seems like the Pythagorean theorem. Because for a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, BC is the hypotenuse, so:

BC² = AB² + AC²

Plugging in the known values:

5² = x² + 2²  
Which simplifies to 25 = x² + 4  
Subtracting 4 from both sides: x² = 21  
Therefore, x = √21

Looking at the answer choices, option C is √21. So that should be the answer. Let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up anything. 

The right angle is at A, so AB and AC are legs. BC is hypotenuse. Given AC=2, BC=5, so AB squared is 25-4=21. Yep, so x is sqrt(21). The answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told:

- Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ has a **right angle** at vertex $ A $. This implies:
  - $ \angle BAC = 90^\circ $
  - Sides $ AB $ and $ AC $ are **perpendicular**
  - Side $ BC $ is the **hypotenuse**, as it lies opposite the right angle

Thus, $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with:

- Legs: $ AB $ and $ AC $
- Hypotenuse: $ BC $

---

### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

From the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = (\text{Leg}_1)^2 + (\text{Leg}_2)^2
$$

Let’s denote:

- $ AB = x $ → unknown leg
- $ AC = 2 $ → known leg
- $ BC = 5 $ → hypotenuse

Apply the formula:

$$
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 \\
\Rightarrow 5^2 = x^2 + 2^2 \\
\Rightarrow 25 = x^2 + 4
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x^2 = 25 - 4 = 21 \\
\Rightarrow x = \sqrt{21}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Match with Answer Choices**

The possible answers are:

- A. $ 2\sqrt{3} $
- B. $ \sqrt{17} $
- C. $ \sqrt{21} $
- D. $ \sqrt{29} $

Clearly, the exact value of $ x $ is $ \sqrt{21} $, which matches **Choice C**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

Final Answer: C
