MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the measure of angle KJL in this parallelogram JKLM. First, I need to recall the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. The diagonals bisect each other.

Looking at the given information, there are several constraints. Let me list them out:

- It's a parallelogram J K L M, so sides JK || LM and JM || KL. Also, sides JK = LM and JM = KL.
- Length of ML is 45 units. Wait, since it's a parallelogram, ML should be equal to JK. So JK is also 45? But then there's another constraint that says LengthOf(Line(JK)) = Add(Mul(2,b),3). Hmm, maybe variables involved here. Similarly, LengthOf(MJ) is 3a. But maybe we can relate these later.

Also, angles: MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K) is 70°, and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is 30°. Wait, those angles... Let me visualize the parallelogram. Points J, K, L, M. Since it's a parallelogram, the order matters. So the vertices are connected as J-K-L-M-J. So sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ.

So angle at point L between points K, L, M is angle KLM which is given as 30°, and angle at point L between points M, L, K is angle MLK? Wait, no. Wait, the notation for angle is usually the middle letter being the vertex. So MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) would be the angle at point L between points M, L, K. That's angle KLM? Or is it angle at point L between M and K? So yes, angle at L between K and M, so that's angle KLM. And angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M, same thing. Wait, but the first one is angle(M,L,K) which is angle at L between M and K. Then the second angle is angle(K,L,M), which is angle at L between K and M. Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps different angles?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again. 

In the problem statement:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70): This is angle at point L formed by points M, L, K. So that's angle KLM (since L is the vertex). Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. However, given that angle KLM is 30°, according to the second measurement. Wait, hold on, there's conflicting info here. Wait, the problem states:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70) – which is angle at L between M and K. Then MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30) – which is angle at L between K and M. Wait, that can't both be true unless they're the same angle, but they have different measures. That suggests that maybe I misread the notation.

Wait, angle notation: The middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(M,L,K) is angle at L between points M and K. Similarly, Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between points K and M. Wait, that's the same angle! So that can't be. There must be some confusion here. Unless there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the angles refer to different vertices.

Alternatively, maybe the first angle is at point K? No, because the middle letter is L. Wait, no. Let me check again. For example, Angle(M,L,K) is the angle at point L between segments LM and LK. So that's the angle at vertex L between sides LM and LK. Which in the parallelogram would be angle KLM. Wait, but then the next angle is MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30). That's angle at point L between K and M, same as before. So same angle? But two different measures? That can't be possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the angles are referring to different angles. Let me re-examine the problem statement:

The given constraints include:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70)

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30)

But perhaps the first angle is at point K? Wait, no. The notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) means the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(M,L,K) is at L, between M and K. So that's angle KLM. Then Angle(K,L,M) is also at L between K and M. Same angle. So this seems contradictory. Unless there's a typo and one of the angles is supposed to be at a different vertex.

Alternatively, maybe the first angle is at point K? If the angle was Angle(K,L,M), that would be angle at L. Wait, no. Wait, maybe there's a mix-up in the notation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first angle is at point K? Like, if it's written as Angle(K,L,M), that's angle at L. But if it were Angle(K,J,L), that would be angle at J. But the problem has Angle(M,L,K) and Angle(K,L,M). Both have vertex at L. So that suggests that both angles are the same, which contradicts their measures. Hence, there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the first angle is at point M? No, the middle letter is L. So angle at L. So both angles are at L. So they must be the same angle, but given as 70 and 30, which is impossible. Therefore, there's something wrong here. But since the problem gives these constraints, maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not in the same triangle. Let me think about the structure of the parallelogram. Let me sketch mentally the parallelogram JKL M. Let me imagine points J, K, L, M arranged such that JKLM is a parallelogram. So sides JK and LM are parallel and equal; sides KL and MJ are parallel and equal. Angles at J and L are congruent, angles at K and M are congruent. Adjacent angles are supplementary.

Given that, suppose angle at L (which is angle KLM) is given as 30 degrees. But the first angle mentioned is angle(M,L,K)=70 degrees. Wait, angle at L between M and K. So that's angle KLM, which in a parallelogram is adjacent to angle at K. Wait, but if angle KLM is 30 degrees, then adjacent angle at K would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. But then why does the problem mention angle(M,L,K) as 70 degrees?

This inconsistency suggests that there might be an error in interpreting the angles. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, looking back at the constraints:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70)

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30)

These two angles. Let me parse them again. 

Angle(M,L,K) is the angle at L between points M and K. So that's angle KLM. 

Angle(K,L,M) is the angle at L between points K and M. Which is the same angle. So again, contradiction. Unless the problem meant something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not both at point L. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the angle notation. For instance, maybe the first angle is at point K instead of L? Let me see. Suppose it was Angle(K,L,M) which would be angle at L. But if it was Angle(M,K,L), that would be angle at K. Let me check:

If the first angle is Angle(M,K,L), that would be angle at K between M and L. Then the second angle is Angle(K,L,M) which is angle at L between K and M. So these are two different angles. That makes sense. So perhaps there's a typo in the original problem, and the first angle is supposed to be Angle(M,K,L) instead of Angle(M,L,K)? Because otherwise, the problem is inconsistent.

Assuming that, then angle at K between M and L is 70 degrees, and angle at L between K and M is 30 degrees. That could make sense. But without knowing for sure, this is speculative. However, given that the problem includes these constraints, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a typo, and that the first angle is at point K, making it angle MKL (i.e., Angle(M,K,L)) measuring 70 degrees, while the second angle is at point L, angle KLM measuring 30 degrees. This way, they are two different angles.

Alternatively, maybe the first angle is at point M? For example, Angle(M,L,K) could be interpreted differently, but standard notation is middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(M,L,K) is at L. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to triangles within the parallelogram. For example, considering triangle KLM. In that case, angle at L is angle KLM, which is given as 30 degrees, and another angle elsewhere. But then where does the 70 degrees come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are part of different triangles. Let me consider that the problem mentions lines like JL and KM, which are diagonals intersecting at R. Given that R is the midpoint of both diagonals, since in a parallelogram diagonals bisect each other. So R is the intersection point of diagonals JL and KM.

Now, given that, perhaps the angles given are related to triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, triangle KLM has angle at L of 30 degrees, and another angle somewhere else. But without more clarity, this is challenging.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are referring to angles in different parts of the parallelogram. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, since JKLM is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So:

JK = LM = 45 units (given that length of ML is 45, so LM=45).

KL = MJ. Also, angles: opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary.

Additionally, the problem states that angles at certain points are given. Let me focus on the angles mentioned:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70) and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30). Assuming these are angles at different vertices.

Let me consider that Angle(M,L,K) is angle at L between M and K, i.e., angle KLM = 70°, and Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M, which is the same angle, which conflicts. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem has a typo or I'm misinterpreting the angles.

Alternatively, maybe Angle(M,L,K) is at point K? For example, if it's Angle(M,K,L), then it's angle at K between M and L. That would make sense. So if the problem had a typo and wrote Angle(M,L,K) instead of Angle(M,K,L), then that angle would be at K between M and L. Let me assume that for now.

So assuming that Angle(M,K,L) is 70°, which would be angle at K between M and L. And Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M, which is 30°. These are two different angles in the parallelogram.

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at K (between M and L) is 70°, then the adjacent angle at L (between K and M) would be 180° - 70° = 110°, but the problem says that angle at L is 30°, which contradicts. Therefore, this still doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the angles are not adjacent? Let me think. In a parallelogram, each pair of adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at K is 70°, then angle at L adjacent to it would be 110°, but if angle at L is given as 30°, that doesn't align. So this suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the given data. However, since the problem provides these constraints, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not internal angles of the parallelogram but angles formed by diagonals. For example, when diagonals intersect, they form various angles. Let me explore this possibility.

Since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, and they intersect at R, the midpoint. The diagonals divide the parallelogram into triangles. For instance, diagonal JL divides the parallelogram into triangles JKL and JML. Diagonal KM divides it into triangles KJM and KLM.

If we consider triangle KLM, which has side lengths KL, LM, and KM. We know LM is 45, KL is 21 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), 21)). Wait, the problem states:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), 21). So KL is 21 units. And LM is 45 units. So triangle KLM has sides KL=21, LM=45, and KM (diagonal). Also, angle at L is given as 30°, assuming that Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L, which is 30°. Then using the Law of Cosines, we can compute KM.

Law of Cosines: KM² = KL² + LM² - 2*KL*LM*cos(angle at L)

Plugging in values:

KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)

Calculate that:

21² = 441

45² = 2025

Sum: 441 + 2025 = 2466

Then subtract 2*21*45*cos(30°). cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Compute 2*21*45 = 1890

Multiply by cos(30°): 1890 * (√3)/2 ≈ 1890 * 0.8660 ≈ 1635.74

Therefore, KM² ≈ 2466 - 1635.74 ≈ 830.26

Thus KM ≈ sqrt(830.26) ≈ 28.8 units.

But I don't know if this helps yet. Now, if we consider triangle KLM, and then look at other triangles.

But wait, the problem also mentions that angle(M,L,K) is 70°, which if it's angle at L, then we have two angles at L: 30° and 70°, which is impossible. So this reinforces the earlier confusion.

Alternatively, if angle(M,L,K) is at point K, then in triangle KLM, angle at K is 70°, and angle at L is 30°, allowing us to find the third angle at M.

In triangle KLM, sum of angles is 180°, so angle at M would be 180 - 70 - 30 = 80°. But then, in the parallelogram, what does this mean?

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at K and angle at M would be equal. But here, if angle at K is 70°, then angle at M would also be 70°, but according to this calculation, angle at M would be 80°, which contradicts. So this suggests inconsistency.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should take a different approach. Let's focus on finding the required angle, which is m∠KJL. That is, the angle at point J between points K and L. In the parallelogram, angle at J is equal to the angle at L, since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. Wait, no: in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M.

But if we can find angle at J, that would give us the desired angle.

Alternatively, since we know some angles in the parallelogram, maybe we can use the fact that consecutive angles are supplementary.

Let me try to find the measures of the angles of the parallelogram. Let me assume that the given angles are part of the parallelogram's internal angles.

Suppose angle at L is 30°, then the consecutive angle at K would be 180° - 30° = 150°. Similarly, angle at M would be equal to angle at K, so 150°, and angle at J would be equal to angle at L, 30°. But then, if angle at J is 30°, that would be our answer. But wait, the question asks for m∠KJL, which is the angle at J between K and L. So that would be angle at J, which would be 30°, making answer A. But the options include A as 30. However, this assumes that the given angle at L is 30°, but there's confusion about which angle is given.

But earlier, the problem states MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30). Assuming this is angle at L between K and M, which would be angle KLM = 30°, then angle at L is 30°, leading to angle at J being 30°, hence answer A. But let's verify this with other constraints.

However, the problem also mentions MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70). If that's angle at L, then it's conflicting. But if it's angle at K, then angle at K would be 70°, and since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle at L would be 110°, contradicting the 30°. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not internal angles of the parallelogram but angles formed by the diagonals. Let's consider that.

When diagonals intersect at R, they form vertical angles and create triangles. For example, in triangle JRL and others. If angle at L is part of one of these triangles, but without clear information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, let's use the given lengths and angles to apply trigonometric laws.

We know that in parallelogram JKLM:

- JK = LM = 45 units
- KL = MJ = 21 units (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), 21))
- Angles: MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70) and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30)

Assume that these angles are in triangle KLM. If angle at L is 30°, and angle at K is 70°, then angle at M is 80°, as computed earlier. Then, using Law of Sines in triangle KLM:

KL / sin(angle at M) = LM / sin(angle at K) = KM / sin(angle at L)

So KL = 21, LM = 45, angle at K = 70°, angle at L = 30°, angle at M = 80°.

So applying Law of Sines:

21 / sin(80°) = 45 / sin(70°)

Check if this holds:

sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848

sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

Left side: 21 / 0.9848 ≈ 21.32

Right side: 45 / 0.9397 ≈ 47.87

Not equal, so this suggests inconsistency. Hence, our assumption may be wrong.

Alternatively, if angle at L is 30°, angle at K is 70°, then angle at M is 80°, but the ratio of sides isn't matching. This indicates that the given angles might not belong to triangle KLM.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not in triangle KLM but in another triangle. For example, triangle JKL. Let me consider that.

In triangle JKL, we know sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL is a diagonal. If we can find the angles in this triangle, it might help.

But to do that, we need more information. Perhaps using the Law of Cosines if we can find the length of JL.

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, the diagonals JL and KM intersect at R, which is their midpoint. So JR = RL, and KR = RM.

But without knowing the length of the diagonals, it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, the problem also mentions that Parallel(Line(J,K),Line(M,L)), which we already knew since it's a parallelogram. Also, Congruent(Line(J,K), Line(M,L)), which confirms that JK = LM = 45. Similarly, Congruent(Line(J,M), Line(K,L)), so JM = KL = 21.

Now, the question is about angle KJL, which is angle at J between K and L. In parallelogram, this is one of the angles at vertex J. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if we can find one angle, we can find its supplement.

Let me consider the angles in the parallelogram. Let's denote:

- angle at J: let's call it x
- angle at K: y
- angle at L: z
- angle at M: w

In a parallelogram, x = z, y = w, and x + y = 180°.

Now, the given angles might relate to these. Let me try to connect them.

If MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 70) is angle at L between M and K, which is angle KLM = z. So z = 70°? Or if it's angle at K, then y = 70°.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30) could be angle at L between K and M, which is z, or angle at M, etc.

Assuming that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M), 30) is angle at L, so z = 30°. Then since x = z, angle at J is 30°, so m∠KJL = 30°, which would make the answer A.

But earlier, there was confusion about the angle measurements. If we accept that angle at L is 30°, then angle at J is also 30°, giving answer A. But why is there another angle given as 70°?

Perhaps that 70° is another angle in the parallelogram. For example, if angle at K is 70°, then since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle at J would be 180 - 70 = 110°, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. 

Wait, but if angle at L is 30°, then angle at K is supplementary to it, so 150°, and angle at M is equal to angle at K, so 150°, and angle at J is equal to angle at L, 30°. So in this scenario, the 70° angle might be an angle in a different context, like formed by the diagonals.

For example, when diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. Suppose the diagonals intersect at R, creating angles. If one of those angles is 70°, then its vertical angle is also 70°, and the adjacent angles would be 110°, since they are supplementary.

But how does that relate to the parallelogram's internal angles?

Alternatively, maybe the 70° angle is part of triangle formed by the diagonal. Let's say diagonal JL splits the parallelogram into two triangles, JKL and JML. In triangle JKL, we have sides JK=45, KL=21, and JL. If we can find an angle in this triangle, it might help.

But without more information, it's challenging. Let me try to calculate the length of diagonal JL using the given angles.

Wait, if we consider triangle KLM with sides KL=21, LM=45, and angle at L = 30°, then we can calculate KM using Law of Cosines as earlier, which gave KM ≈ 28.8. Then, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, the diagonals JL and KM intersect at R, so JR = RL = JL/2, and KR = RM = KM/2.

Now, consider triangle JKL. It has sides JK=45, KL=21, and JL. To find angle at J (which is angle KJL), we can use the Law of Cosines if we know JL. But how?

Alternatively, since we know KM ≈ 28.8, then KR = KM/2 ≈ 14.4. Also, in triangle JKL, we might relate it to other parts.

But this seems too vague. Let me try another approach.

Since the problem also provides that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) and MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,J)) is 180°, and similarly for other sums. Let me parse these.

From the given constraints:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)), MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,J))),180)

This implies that angle(K,L,M) + angle(L,M,J) = 180°. Let's interpret these angles.

Angle(K,L,M) is at point L between K and M, which we previously thought was angle KLM = 30°. Angle(L,M,J) is at point M between L and J. So this would be angle at M between L and J, which is angle JML. In the parallelogram, angle at M is equal to angle at K. If angle at L is 30°, then angle at K is 150°, so angle at M is also 150°, and angle JML would be part of that.

But angle JML is part of angle at M. If we assume that angle JML is part of the 150°, but how?

Alternatively, if angle(K,L,M) is 30°, and angle(L,M,J) is some value, adding to 180°, then angle(L,M,J) would be 150°. This suggests that angle at M between L and J is 150°, which would be the entire angle at M, implying that the angle at M is 150°, making angle at K also 150°, and angle at L and J as 30°. Thus, m∠KJL = 30°, option A.

But then where does the 70° angle come from? The other constraint: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(M,J,K)), MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L))),180). Let's break down these angles.

Angle(M,J,K) is at point J between M and K. That would be angle at J between M and K, which is angle KJM. Angle(J,K,L) is at point K between J and L, which is angle JKL. Their sum is 180°. If angle at J is 30°, and angle at K is 150°, then angle KJM (part of angle at J) plus angle JKL (which is angle at K) would be 30 + 150 = 180, satisfying the condition. This fits.

So this suggests that angle at J is 30°, which is m∠KJL, making answer A.

But earlier, there was a conflicting angle of 70°, which might relate to another part of the diagram. Perhaps it's an angle formed by the diagonals. For example, when diagonals intersect, forming triangles with angles that add up to certain values.

But based on the given constraints and the consistency of the angle sums, it seems that the angle at J is 30°, so the answer is A.

However, I need to confirm this with the given data. Let me summarize:

- From the angle sums, we derived that angle at L is 30°, making angle at J also 30°.
- The given angle of 70° might be an angle formed by the diagonals or another part of the figure, but since it doesn't conflict with the derived angles, it might be part of another relationship.

Thus, the measure of angle KJL is 30°, corresponding to option A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle KJL $ in parallelogram $ JKLM $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and constraints provided. Here’s the structured reasoning:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Parallelogram**

Given:
- $ JKLM $ is a parallelogram → Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- $ JK \parallel LM $, $ KL \parallel MJ $
- $ JK = LM = 45 $, $ KL = MJ = 21 $

Important property of a parallelogram: **Opposite angles are equal**, and **consecutive angles are supplementary** (sum to 180°).

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Given Angle Measures**

From the problem:
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle (M, L, K) ) = 70^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle (K, L, M) ) = 30^\circ $

Using the angle notation convention (middle letter is the vertex):
- $ \angle (M, L, K) $: Vertex at $ L $, between $ M $ and $ K $ → $ \angle KLM = 70^\circ $
- $ \angle (K, L, M) $: Vertex at $ L $, between $ K $ and $ M $ → Same as above, $ \angle KLM = 30^\circ $

This creates a contradiction unless the angle measures pertain to different angles.

However, the key constraint:
$$
\text{SumOf}( \angle (K, L, M), \angle (L, M, J) ) = 180^\circ
$$
suggests that:
- $ \angle (K, L, M) = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle (L, M, J) = 150^\circ $

Thus, $ \angle KLM = 30^\circ $, and the supplementary angle at $ M $ is $ 150^\circ $. This aligns with the known property of parallelograms that opposite angles are equal.

---

### **Step 3: Determine $ m\angle KJL $**

We are asked to find $ m\angle KJL $, which is the angle at vertex $ J $ between points $ K $ and $ L $ — that is, $ \angle KJL $.

In a parallelogram:
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.

Since $ \angle KLM = 30^\circ $, the opposite angle at $ J $ is:
$$
m\angle KJL = \angle KLM = 30^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the given constraints and the geometric properties of parallelograms, the measure of $ \angle KJL $ is $ 30^\circ $.

---

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
