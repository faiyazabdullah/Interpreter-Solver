MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a trapezoid ABCD, which is also an isosceles trapezoid. The angles at each vertex are related through some equations. Let me start by recalling what I know about trapezoids and their angles.

First, in any quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees. Since it's a trapezoid, two sides are parallel. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Also, the legs (the non-parallel sides) are congruent, and the base angles are equal. Wait, but how does that affect the angles here?

The problem gives us specific angle measures in terms of x. Let me write down the given information:

- Angle A = x
- Angle B = 2x
- Angle C = 2x
- Angle D = x

Also, since it's a trapezoid, maybe there are some relationships between these angles. But wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. That is, if one base angle is, say, angle A, then the adjacent angle on the other base would be supplementary. However, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Hmm.

Wait, but first, let me check the sum of angles. According to the problem statement, the sum of angles A, B, C, D equals 360 degrees. Let me verify that:

Sum = x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x. And this equals 360°, so 6x = 360 => x = 60°. Wait, but hold on, that seems straightforward. Then angle B and angle C would both be 120°, and angles A and D are 60°. But wait, that would make the trapezoid have angles of 60°, 120°, 120°, 60°, adding up to 360. 

But wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Let me think. If AB and CD are the two bases, then angles at A and D should be equal? Or angles at A and B? Wait, no. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Suppose the bases are AD and BC. Then angles at A and D are adjacent to base AD, so they should be equal. Similarly, angles at B and C are adjacent to base BC, so they should be equal. Alternatively, if the bases are AB and CD, then angles at A and B would be adjacent to base AB, but that might not fit. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify which sides are the bases.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that it's an isosceles trapezoid implies that angles A and D are equal, as well as angles B and C. Wait, the problem says "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), MeasureOf(Angle(D)))" and "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), MeasureOf(Angle(C)))", so that aligns with the properties of an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore, the angles given in the problem already satisfy the conditions for being an isosceles trapezoid.

So according to the given equations, solving for x:

Sum of angles: x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x = 360° → x = 60°. Therefore, angle B is 2x = 120°. So the measure of angle B is 120°, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes in trapezoids, consecutive angles are supplementary. For example, if AB and CD are the two bases, then angles A and D are on one base, and angles B and C are on the other. So angles A and B would be adjacent, meaning they are supplementary. Wait, if angle A is 60°, then angle B should be 120°, which makes sense because 60+120=180. Similarly, angle D is 60°, and angle C is 120°, so they add up to 180. So that works. Thus, the trapezoid has angles alternating between 60° and 120°, which fits the isosceles trapezoid properties. Hence, angle B is 120°, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check again if there's any mistake here. The problem states that the trapezoid is isosceles, so the base angles are equal. So if angles A and D are equal, and angles B and C are equal. Which matches the given equations. Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So angle B is 2x, and x is 60°, so angle B is 120°, which is option D. Therefore, the answer should be D.
