<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram JKLM. The question is asking for the measure of angle JKL. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. That means that adjacent angles add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but let me check the given information again.

The problem states that there are some specific angles given. It says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70 degrees. Wait, angle M,L,K would be angle at point L between points M, L, K? Or maybe I need to clarify the notation. In standard notation, Angle(M,L,K) is the angle at point L formed by points M, L, K. Similarly, Angle(K,L,J) is the angle at point L formed by points K, L, J. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the angles at each vertex... Hmm.

Wait, but let me think about how the points are arranged. Since it's a parallelogram J-K-L-M, so the order of the letters matters. So, in a parallelogram, the vertices are connected as J to K, K to L, L to M, M back to J. So, the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Then, diagonals are JL and KM, which intersect at point R.

Now, the angles mentioned here: Angle(M,L,K) is at point L, between points M, L, K. So that's angle at L between ML and LK. Similarly, Angle(K,L,J) is at point L between points K, L, J. So that's angle at L between KL and LJ. Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. But wait, if we consider the angles at point L, then since it's a parallelogram, the angles at L should be related to the other angles.

But wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. For example, angle at K and angle at L are consecutive, so they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but maybe I need to draw this mentally. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Let me label the points:

- J connected to K and M.
- K connected to J and L.
- L connected to K and M.
- M connected to L and J.

So, the parallelogram has vertices J, K, L, M in order. Therefore, the angles at each vertex are:

- At point J: between sides JM and JK.
- At point K: between sides KJ and KL.
- At point L: between sides LK and LM.
- At point M: between sides ML and MJ.

But the problem mentions angles like Angle(M,L,K). Which is the angle at point L between ML and LK. So that's the angle at L between sides ML and LK. Similarly, Angle(K,L,J) is the angle at L between KL and LJ. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the sides at point L are KL and LM. Wait, no. Wait, point L is connected to K and M. So the two sides meeting at L are KL (from K to L) and LM (from L to M). Therefore, the angle at L is between KL and LM. However, the problem mentions Angle(M,L,K) which is the angle at L between M, L, K. So that would be the same as the angle at L between ML and LK, which is indeed the angle at L. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the sum of the angles at each vertex?

Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, for instance, angle at K and angle at L are consecutive. Wait, but if the parallelogram is labeled in order J-K-L-M-J, then the consecutive angles are at J and K, K and L, L and M, M and J. So each pair of consecutive angles adds up to 180 degrees.

But according to the problem statement, MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30 degrees. That angle is at point L, between ML and LK. So that's angle at L. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70 degrees. That angle is at point L between KL and LJ. Wait, but point J is connected to L via diagonal? Because in the parallelogram, the sides are only JK, KL, LM, MJ. So, the line JL is a diagonal connecting J to L, right? And KM connects K to M. So, the problem mentions that lines JL and KM intersect at point R.

But back to the angles. So, the angle at point L between KL and LJ is 70 degrees? Wait, but that seems odd because in a parallelogram, the angles at each vertex are determined by the sides. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Let me re-express the given angles:

- MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30°. This is the angle at point L between segments ML and LK. So that's the angle at L between side LM and side LK. In a parallelogram, the sides at L are LM and LK. Wait, but LM is one side, LK is another. So the angle between them is the internal angle at L. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at L is, say, x degrees, then the adjacent angle at K would be 180 - x degrees.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70 degrees. This is the angle at point L between segments KL and LJ. Wait, but segment LJ is a diagonal, not a side. So that angle is not part of the standard angles of the parallelogram. Wait, so maybe I need to consider triangle K-L-J? Because angle at L between KL and LJ would be part of triangle K-L-J.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to parse each angle carefully.

First, Angle(M,L,K): points M, L, K. So vertex at L, with segments LM and LK. So yes, that's the internal angle at point L of the parallelogram. Because LM and LK are adjacent sides meeting at L. Therefore, this angle is the internal angle at L. Similarly, Angle(K,L,J): points K, L, J. Vertex at L, with segments LK and LJ. Here, LK is a side, but LJ is a diagonal. So this angle is not an internal angle of the parallelogram itself, but rather an angle formed by a side and a diagonal.

Therefore, the given angles are:

- At point L, between LM and LK: 30 degrees (this is the internal angle at L).
- At point L, between LK and LJ: 70 degrees (this is an angle inside triangle K-L-J).

But in a parallelogram, the internal angles are determined by the sides. Let me note that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if angle at L is 30 degrees, then angle at J would also be 30 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M. Wait, but depending on the shape. Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one angle is x, the next is 180 - x, etc.

But wait, the first angle given is angle at L, which is between LM and LK. If that's 30 degrees, then the adjacent angle at K (between LK and KM?) Wait, no. Wait, the angle at K would be between sides JK and KL. So, if the internal angle at L is 30 degrees, then the internal angle at K would be supplementary to that? No, because in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at L and angle at K are consecutive, hence their measures add up to 180 degrees. So if angle at L is 30 degrees, then angle at K would be 150 degrees. But wait, the second given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees. Let me see.

Wait, angle(K,L,J) is the angle at L between K, L, J. So that's angle between LK and LJ. So that's part of triangle K-L-J. Let me imagine triangle K-L-J. In this triangle, we have sides LK, LJ, and KJ. We know angle at L is 70 degrees. Also, in the parallelogram, sides LK and KJ are adjacent sides? Wait, LK is a side of the parallelogram, and KJ is another side. Wait, in the parallelogram, sides JK and LM are congruent and parallel, and sides KL and MJ are congruent and parallel.

Alternatively, since we have a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Given that, the lengths of the sides are:

- Length of JK = Length of LM
- Length of KL = Length of MJ

Also, the problem gives specific measurements:

- LengthOf(Line(J,K)) = Add(Mul(2,b), 3)
- LengthOf(Line(K,L)) = 21
- LengthOf(Line(L,M)) = 45
- LengthOf(Line(M,J)) = Mul(3,a)

Additionally, it's stated that:

- Parallel(Line(J,K), Line(L,M))
- Parallel(Line(K,L), Line(M,J))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)), LengthOf(Line(L,M))) → So JK = LM
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), LengthOf(Line(M,J))) → KL = MJ

So from these, since JK = LM and KL = MJ. Let me check the given values. 

Given that LengthOf(Line(K,L)) = 21, which is KL = 21. Then, since KL = MJ, so MJ = 21. Also, LM = JK. And LM is given as 45. Therefore, JK = LM = 45. Also, LengthOf(Line(M,J)) is 3a, which should equal MJ = 21. So 3a = 21 → a = 7. 

Then, LengthOf(Line(J,K)) is 2b + 3, which equals JK = 45. So 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b = 21. 

So that's the side lengths. Now, going back to angles.

We were told that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30°, which is the internal angle at L, between sides LM and LK. Since LM = 45 and LK = 21. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are LM and LK, so the angle between them is 30 degrees. So that's one of the internal angles. Then, the adjacent angle at K would be supplementary to this, so 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. 

But then, the problem also gives MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees. Which is angle at L between K, L, J. As previously discussed, this is angle between LK and LJ, where LJ is a diagonal. So, in triangle K-L-J, we have angle at L being 70 degrees, and sides LK = 21, and other sides?

Wait, but in triangle K-L-J, we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines to relate the sides and angles. Let me think. 

In triangle K-L-J:

- Side KL = 21
- Side LK = 21 (same as KL)
- Wait, no. Wait, in triangle K-L-J, the sides are KL, LJ, and KJ. 

Wait, KL is one side of the parallelogram, which is 21. KJ is another side of the parallelogram, which is 45. So in triangle K-L-J, sides are KL=21, KJ=45, and LJ (the diagonal). And angle at L is 70 degrees. 

So using the Law of Cosines in triangle K-L-J:

KJ² = KL² + LJ² - 2 * KL * LJ * cos(angle at L)

But we don't know LJ yet. Alternatively, using Law of Sines:

sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(angle at L)/KJ

But maybe it's better to use the Law of Cosines. Let me write down:

KJ² = KL² + LJ² - 2 * KL * LJ * cos(angle at L)

But we have KJ = 45, KL = 21, angle at L = 70 degrees. Let me plug in:

45² = 21² + LJ² - 2*21*LJ*cos(70°)

Calculating left side: 2025

Right side: 441 + LJ² - 42*LJ*cos(70°)

So,

2025 = 441 + LJ² - 42*LJ*cos(70°)

Subtract 441:

2025 - 441 = LJ² - 42*LJ*cos(70°)

Which is 1584 = LJ² - 42*LJ*cos(70°)

Hmm, solving for LJ. Let me compute cos(70°). Let me approximate cos(70°). cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420.

So:

1584 = LJ² - 42*LJ*(0.3420)

≈ LJ² - 42*0.3420*LJ

Calculate 42*0.3420 ≈ 14.364

Thus:

LJ² - 14.364*LJ - 1584 = 0

This is quadratic equation in terms of LJ. Let me denote x = LJ:

x² - 14.364x - 1584 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [14.364 ± sqrt( (14.364)^2 + 4*1584 )]/2

Compute discriminant:

(14.364)^2 + 4*1584 ≈ 206.35 + 6336 ≈ 6542.35

sqrt(6542.35) ≈ 80.89

So x ≈ [14.364 + 80.89]/2 ≈ 95.254/2 ≈ 47.627

Or negative solution, which we ignore. So LJ ≈ 47.63 units.

But maybe there's a way without calculating numerically? Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since we have a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. But we might not need that here.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the main question: finding the measure of angle JKL. Wait, angle JKL is the angle at point K between points J, K, L. So that's the internal angle at point K of the parallelogram. 

Earlier, we thought that angle at L is 30 degrees, so angle at K would be supplementary to that, making it 150 degrees. But the problem also gives us that angle at L between K, L, J is 70 degrees. How does this fit into the picture?

Wait, maybe my earlier assumption was wrong. Let me think again.

If angle at L (internal angle) is 30 degrees, then the adjacent angle at K would be 150 degrees. However, the given angle MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70 degrees. Which is the angle at L between K, L, J. So that's different from the internal angle at L. 

So, in the parallelogram, the internal angle at L is 30 degrees, and the angle between side LK and diagonal LJ is 70 degrees. So, in triangle K-L-J, angle at L is 70 degrees, and we can use that to find something else.

But maybe there's another relationship here. Let me consider triangle K-L-J. In this triangle, we have sides KL = 21, KJ = 45, and angle at L = 70 degrees. Using the Law of Cosines as before gives us the length of diagonal LJ, but perhaps we can use the Law of Sines to find other angles?

Law of Sines in triangle K-L-J:

sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(angle at L)/KJ

So, sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(70°)/45

But we don't know angle at K or LJ. Alternatively, angle at J in triangle K-L-J?

Sum of angles in triangle is 180 degrees. So angle at L is 70 degrees, angle at K and angle at J sum to 110 degrees. But unless we have more info, this may not help directly.

Wait, but in the parallelogram, the diagonal JL divides it into two triangles. So, triangle JKL and triangle JML. Wait, but maybe considering vectors or coordinates could help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to the parallelogram. Let me place point K at origin (0,0). Since KL is a side of length 21, and angle at L is 30 degrees. Wait, but maybe it's easier to set coordinates based on known angles.

Alternatively, suppose we take point L at the origin. Let me think. Let me try to define coordinates such that point L is at (0,0). Since angle at L is between LM and LK, which is 30 degrees. Let me assume that side LK is along the positive x-axis, and side LM makes a 30-degree angle with LK.

So, if point L is at (0,0), then point K is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me assume length LK is 21, so point K is at (21, 0). Then, since angle at L is 30 degrees, the direction of LM is 30 degrees above the x-axis. The length of LM is 45, so point M is located at 45 units from L at 30 degrees. So coordinates of M would be (45*cos(30°), 45*sin(30°)). 

cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sin(30°) = 0.5. So coordinates of M are approximately (45*0.8660, 45*0.5) ≈ (38.97, 22.5).

Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector from K to L is (-21, 0) (since K is at (21,0) and L is at (0,0)), and vector from L to M is (38.97, 22.5). To find coordinates of J, since in a parallelogram, vector KL equals vector JM. Vector KL is from K to L: (-21, 0). Therefore, vector JM should be the same. Since M is at (38.97, 22.5), then point J is M plus vector KL. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the vector from K to L should be equal to the vector from M to J. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

In a parallelogram, the vector from J to K equals the vector from L to M. So, vector JK = vector LM. Vector JK is K - J. Vector LM is M - L. Since L is at (0,0), M is at (38.97, 22.5). So vector LM is (38.97, 22.5). Therefore, vector JK should be equal to that. Since point K is at (21,0), then vector JK is K - J = (21 - x_J, 0 - y_J) = (38.97, 22.5). So:

21 - x_J = 38.97 ⇒ x_J = 21 - 38.97 = -17.97

0 - y_J = 22.5 ⇒ y_J = -22.5

So coordinates of J are approximately (-17.97, -22.5).

Now, we can find coordinates of J, K, L, M:

- J: (-17.97, -22.5)
- K: (21, 0)
- L: (0, 0)
- M: (38.97, 22.5)

Now, we can calculate angle JKL, which is the angle at point K between points J, K, L. So, angle at K between J-K and K-L.

To find this angle, we can use vectors. The vectors involved are KJ and KL.

Vector KJ is from K to J: J - K = (-17.97 - 21, -22.5 - 0) = (-38.97, -22.5)

Vector KL is from K to L: L - K = (0 - 21, 0 - 0) = (-21, 0)

The angle between vectors KJ and KL at point K is the angle JKL.

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (KJ · KL) / (|KJ| |KL|)

First compute the dot product:

KJ · KL = (-38.97)(-21) + (-22.5)(0) = 38.97*21 + 0 = let's calculate 38.97 * 21.

Well, 38.97 * 20 = 779.4, plus 38.97*1 = 38.97 → total ≈ 779.4 + 38.97 = 818.37

Next, |KJ| is the magnitude of vector KJ: sqrt((-38.97)^2 + (-22.5)^2)

Calculate (-38.97)^2 ≈ (38.97)^2. Let me approximate:

Since 38^2 = 1444, 39^2 = 1521. 38.97 is close to 39. Let me compute 38.97^2 ≈ ?

Well, 38.97 = 39 - 0.03. So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 39² - 2*39*0.03 + (0.03)^2 = 1521 - 2.34 + 0.0009 ≈ 1518.6609.

Then (-22.5)^2 = 506.25

Total |KJ| squared is approx 1518.66 + 506.25 = 2024.91 → sqrt(2024.91) ≈ 45.0 (since 45² = 2025). Wow! So |KJ| ≈ 45 units. Which matches our earlier calculation since KJ is one of the sides of the parallelogram, which was given as 45 units. Makes sense.

|KL| is the magnitude of vector KL, which is sqrt((-21)^2 + 0^2) = 21 units.

So cos(theta) = 818.37 / (45 * 21) = 818.37 / 945 ≈ 0.866.

What's arccos(0.866)? Well, cos(30°) ≈ 0.866. So theta ≈ 30 degrees. Wait, but the question asks for angle JKL, which we just computed as approximately 30 degrees. But this contradicts our previous thought that angle at K would be supplementary to the angle at L (which was 30 degrees), implying angle at K would be 150 degrees. What's going on here?

Ah, here's the mistake. Earlier, I assumed that the internal angle at L is 30 degrees, and thus the adjacent angle at K would be 150 degrees. But according to this coordinate calculation, angle at K is 30 degrees. There's a contradiction here. Why?

Because the given angle at L was not the internal angle of the parallelogram. Wait, no—the angle at L between LM and LK is the internal angle. Wait, but in this coordinate system, the internal angle at L is between LM and LK. Let me verify that.

In the coordinate setup, point L is at (0,0), point M is at (approx) (38.97, 22.5), and point K is at (21,0). So vector LM is from L to M: (38.97, 22.5), and vector LK is from L to K: (21, 0). The angle between these two vectors is the internal angle at L.

So, let's compute that angle. The vectors LM and LK are (38.97, 22.5) and (21, 0). Compute the angle between them.

Dot product: (38.97)(21) + (22.5)(0) = 818.37 as before.

|LM| = sqrt(38.97² + 22.5²) ≈ sqrt(1518.66 + 506.25) ≈ sqrt(2024.91) ≈ 45, which matches the given LM length of 45 units.

|LK| = 21 units.

So cos(theta) = 818.37/(45*21) = same as before, which is ~0.866, leading to theta ≈ 30 degrees. So the internal angle at L is indeed 30 degrees. Therefore, the internal angle at K should be supplementary to that, meaning 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. But according to the coordinate calculation, angle at K is 30 degrees. Contradiction!

Where is the error here? Let me check the coordinate calculation again. The angle at K is between vectors KJ and KL. Wait, in the coordinate system, point K is at (21,0), point J is at (-17.97, -22.5), and point L is at (0,0). So vectors KJ and KL are:

From K to J: J - K = (-17.97 - 21, -22.5 - 0) = (-38.97, -22.5)

From K to L: L - K = (0 - 21, 0 - 0) = (-21, 0)

So the angle between these two vectors is angle JKL. But according to the calculation, this angle is arccos(818.37/(45*21)) ≈ arccos(0.866) ≈ 30 degrees. But this suggests that angle at K is 30 degrees, which conflicts with the idea that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.

Wait, this indicates a problem in the assumptions. How come the internal angles are both 30 degrees? That can't be. Unless the parallelogram is degenerate, which it isn't. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if one internal angle is 30 degrees, then the opposite angle is also 30 degrees, and the other two angles are 150 degrees each. But in our case, if angle at L is 30 degrees, then angle at J is also 30 degrees, and angles at K and M are 150 degrees each. But according to the coordinate system, angle at K is 30 degrees. That implies that angle at J is also 30 degrees, which would mean that angles at L and J are both 30 degrees, and angles at K and M are 150 degrees. But in that case, the internal angle at K would be 150 degrees, not 30. So why did the calculation give 30 degrees?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of vectors. Let me double-check the angle calculation. The angle between vectors KJ and KL at point K. Vector KJ is from K to J: pointing towards J. Vector KL is from K to L: pointing towards L. So, the angle between these two vectors is the internal angle at K. 

But according to the calculation, this angle came out as 30 degrees, which would imply that angle at K is 30 degrees, contradicting the fact that it should be supplementary to angle at L. Hence, there's a contradiction here. This suggests an error in the reasoning.

Wait, maybe the given angle at L is not the internal angle. Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees. Which is the angle at L between M, L, K. But in the coordinate system, this angle is 30 degrees. But if that's the internal angle, then the adjacent angle at K should be 150 degrees. So why does the calculation show angle at K as 30 degrees?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the direction of vectors. Let me recalculate the angle at K. Let me recompute the dot product.

Vectors:

KJ is from K to J: J - K = (-17.97 - 21, -22.5 - 0) = (-38.97, -22.5)

KL is from K to L: L - K = (0 - 21, 0 - 0) = (-21, 0)

So, the angle between these vectors is calculated as follows:

Dot product = (-38.97)(-21) + (-22.5)(0) = 818.37

Magnitude of KJ: sqrt((-38.97)^2 + (-22.5)^2) ≈ 45

Magnitude of KL: sqrt((-21)^2 + 0^2) = 21

So cos(theta) = 818.37 / (45 * 21) ≈ 818.37 / 945 ≈ 0.866

Which corresponds to 30 degrees. So this suggests that angle at K is 30 degrees, but this contradicts the property of a parallelogram. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe the initial assumption that the given angle at L is the internal angle is incorrect. Let me check again. 

The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees. This is the angle at point L, between points M, L, K. In the coordinate system, this is the angle between vectors LM and LK, which we calculated as 30 degrees. But in a parallelogram, the internal angle at L is supposed to be the angle between LM and LK, which is indeed what we calculated. So that should be the internal angle at L. Hence, if that's 30 degrees, then the adjacent angle at K should be 150 degrees. But according to the calculation, angle at K is 30 degrees. This inconsistency suggests a fundamental error in the setup.

Wait, let me check the parallelogram properties again. In a parallelogram, the sum of two adjacent angles is 180 degrees. So if angle at L is 30 degrees, then angle at K should be 150 degrees. But according to our coordinate calculation, angle at K is 30 degrees. This suggests that either the coordinate calculation is wrong, or the interpretation of the given angles is wrong.

Wait, maybe the given angle at L is not the internal angle. Perhaps it's referring to a different angle. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 30). So this is the angle at point L, between M, L, K. In the parallelogram, this would typically be the internal angle at L. But if that's the case, then the calculation showing angle at K as 30 degrees contradicts the parallelogram properties. Hence, there must be an error in my coordinate setup.

Wait, perhaps I assigned the vectors incorrectly. Let me try again. Maybe I mixed up the vectors.

Let me try to define the parallelogram properly. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, if LM and JK are opposite sides, and KL and MJ are opposite sides. Given that, if LM = 45, then JK = 45. KL = 21, so MJ = 21.

In the coordinate system, I placed L at (0,0), K at (21,0), M at (45*cos(30°), 45*sin(30°)), and J such that vector KL equals vector JM. Wait, but maybe I should ensure that vector KL equals vector JM.

Vector KL is from K to L: L - K = (-21, 0). Vector JM should be equal to this. Since point M is at (x, y), then point J is M + vector KL. Wait, no. Vector JM should equal vector KL. Vector JM is from J to M: M - J = KL. So M - J = KL, which is (-21, 0). Thus, J = M - KL = M - (-21, 0) = M + (21, 0). Wait, this might be the mistake.

Previously, I said vector KL is from K to L, which is (-21, 0), and vector JM should equal vector KL. So vector JM = KL → M - J = KL → J = M - KL. 

Wait, let me redo this. If vector KL is from K to L: L - K = (-21, 0). In a parallelogram, vector KL equals vector JM. Vector JM is from J to M: M - J. So M - J = KL → J = M - KL. 

So if M is at (45*cos(30°), 45*sin(30°)) ≈ (38.97, 22.5), then J = M - KL = M - (-21, 0) = M + (21, 0). So adding (21, 0) to M's coordinates: 

J_x = 38.97 + 21 = 60.97

J_y = 22.5 + 0 = 22.5

Wait, this changes things! Previously, I had mistakenly calculated J as M - KL instead of J = M - KL. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If vector KL = vector JM, then vector JM = KL. So vector JM = KL → M - J = KL → J = M - KL. 

Since KL is (-21, 0), then J = M - (-21, 0) = M + (21, 0). So J's coordinates are (M_x + 21, M_y + 0). 

Given that M is at (38.97, 22.5), then J is at (38.97 + 21, 22.5) = (60.97, 22.5). 

Ah! So earlier, I had incorrectly subtracted vector KL instead of adding. This explains the discrepancy. Let me recalculate with corrected coordinates.

Correct coordinates:

- L: (0, 0)
- K: (21, 0)
- M: (38.97, 22.5)
- J: (38.97 + 21, 22.5) = (60.97, 22.5)

Now, let's recalculate vectors for angle at K.

Point K is at (21, 0). Point J is at (60.97, 22.5), point L is at (0, 0).

Vector KJ is from K to J: J - K = (60.97 - 21, 22.5 - 0) = (39.97, 22.5)

Vector KL is from K to L: L - K = (0 - 21, 0 - 0) = (-21, 0)

Now, compute the angle between vectors KJ and KL at point K.

Dot product: (39.97)(-21) + (22.5)(0) = -839.37 + 0 = -839.37

Magnitude of KJ: sqrt(39.97² + 22.5²)

Calculate 39.97² ≈ 1597.6 (since 40² = 1600, so 39.97 is slightly less), and 22.5² = 506.25 → total ≈ 1597.6 + 506.25 = 2103.85 → sqrt ≈ 45.87 units.

Magnitude of KL is 21.

So cos(theta) = (-839.37)/(45.87 * 21) ≈ -839.37 / 963.27 ≈ -0.871

So theta ≈ arccos(-0.871) ≈ 150 degrees. Ah! This makes sense now. The angle at K is 150 degrees, which is supplementary to the angle at L (30 degrees), satisfying the parallelogram property. 

So earlier mistake was in calculating the position of point J; I had added instead of subtracting the vector, leading to incorrect results. Now, with correct coordinates, angle at K is 150 degrees. But the problem asks for m∠JKL, which is the angle at K, so 150 degrees? But none of the answer choices include 150. The options are A. 60, B. 70, C. 80, D. 90. Hmm, this suggests a problem.

Wait, but the problem gave another angle: MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees. Let me check if this aligns with the current setup.

Angle(K,L,J) is the angle at L between K, L, J. Let me calculate that. With current coordinates:

Point K is at (21, 0), L is at (0, 0), J is at (60.97, 22.5). So angle at L between points K, L, J. 

Vectors from L to K: K - L = (21, 0)

Vector from L to J: J - L = (60.97, 22.5)

Angle between these two vectors at L. Let's calculate it.

Dot product: (21)(60.97) + (0)(22.5) = 21*60.97 ≈ 1280.37

Magnitude of vector LK: 21

Magnitude of vector LJ: sqrt(60.97² + 22.5²) ≈ sqrt(3717 + 506.25) = sqrt(4223.25) ≈ 65.0

So cos(theta) = 1280.37 / (21 * 65.0) ≈ 1280.37 / 1365 ≈ 0.938

So theta ≈ arccos(0.938) ≈ 20 degrees. But the problem says this angle is 70 degrees. Oh no! Another contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that there's a mistake in assuming that the angle at L between LM and LK is 30 degrees, but according to this calculation, it's giving us an angle at L between LK and LJ as 20 degrees, whereas the problem states it should be 70 degrees. So there's still inconsistency. What went wrong?

Let me re-express the given data. The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees. From the previous calculation, with the current coordinates, angle at L between ML and LK is 30 degrees (as intended), but the angle at L between KL and LJ is 20 degrees. However, the problem says this angle is 70 degrees. So there's a conflict here.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the placement of the points is incorrect. Perhaps the angle at L between KL and LJ is not derived from the current setup. Let me reevaluate.

Maybe I need to use the given angle MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees to find relations between the sides or other angles. Let's revisit the earlier Law of Cosines approach in triangle K-L-J.

In triangle K-L-J, we have:

- KL = 21
- KJ = 45
- angle at L = 70 degrees

Using Law of Cosines:

KJ² = KL² + LJ² - 2*KL*LJ*cos(angle at L)

Plugging in:

45² = 21² + LJ² - 2*21*LJ*cos(70°)

As before, this leads to:

2025 = 441 + LJ² - 42*LJ*cos(70°)

Rearranged:

LJ² - 42*cos(70°)*LJ + (441 - 2025) = 0

Wait, no. Wait, 2025 - 441 = 1584, so:

LJ² - 42*cos(70°)*LJ - 1584 = 0

Let me calculate cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420.

So:

LJ² - 42*0.3420*LJ - 1584 = 0

Which is:

LJ² - 14.364*LJ - 1584 = 0

Solving this quadratic:

LJ = [14.364 ± sqrt(14.364² + 4*1584)] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

14.364² ≈ 206.35

4*1584 = 6336

Total discriminant ≈ 206.35 + 6336 = 6542.35

Square root of 6542.35 ≈ 80.89

So LJ ≈ [14.364 + 80.89]/2 ≈ 95.254/2 ≈ 47.627

So LJ ≈ 47.63 units.

Now, in triangle K-L-J, with sides KL=21, KJ=45, LJ≈47.63, and angle at L=70 degrees. Let's verify using Law of Sines.

Law of Sines: sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(angle at L)/KJ

So sin(angle at K)/47.63 = sin(70°)/45

Calculate sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

So sin(angle at K) = (47.63/45) * 0.9397 ≈ (1.0584) * 0.9397 ≈ 0.996

So angle at K ≈ arcsin(0.996) ≈ 85 degrees.

Then, angle at J = 180 - 70 - 85 = 25 degrees.

Now, in the parallelogram, what does this tell us? 

The angle at K in triangle K-L-J is 85 degrees. But in the parallelogram, the internal angle at K is composed of this angle and others? Or is this angle part of the parallelogram's structure?

Wait, in the parallelogram, the diagonal JL splits it into two triangles. In triangle K-L-J, angle at K is part of the parallelogram's angle at K. Wait, no. The internal angle at K of the parallelogram is the angle between sides KJ and KL. But in triangle K-L-J, the angle at K is between KJ and KL? No, because in the triangle, the angle at K is between KJ and KL? Let me visualize.

In triangle K-L-J, the angle at K is between sides KJ and KL. Yes, because the triangle has points K, L, J. So the angle at K is between KJ and KL, which is precisely the internal angle at K of the parallelogram. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested this angle is 85 degrees, which would make the internal angle at K 85 degrees, and since it's a parallelogram, the adjacent angle at L would be 180 - 85 = 95 degrees. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which is the internal angle at L. So this creates a contradiction, as 95 ≠ 30. 

Clearly, there's a significant inconsistency here, indicating that my approach has flaws. Let me try to find another way.

Perhaps the key lies in recognizing that the given angles are not the internal angles of the parallelogram, but involve diagonals. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other and divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. The angles formed by the diagonals with the sides can be calculated using trigonometric relationships.

But given the complexity, perhaps it's best to use the given angle measures to determine the internal angles of the parallelogram.

Let me summarize the given information:

- Angle at L (between ML and LK) is 30 degrees (given as MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))).
- Angle at L (between KL and LJ) is 70 degrees (given as MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J))).

Let me consider that in the parallelogram, the diagonal JL forms two triangles. In triangle K-L-J, we have:

- KL = 21
- KJ = 45
- angle at L = 70 degrees

From this, we can find other angles in this triangle, which may relate to the internal angles of the parallelogram.

As calculated earlier, using Law of Sines:

sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(70°)/45

And from Law of Cosines, we found LJ ≈ 47.63.

So, sin(angle at K) = (LJ/45) * sin(70°) ≈ (47.63/45) * 0.9397 ≈ 1.0584 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.996, so angle at K ≈ 85 degrees.

This angle at K in triangle K-L-J is the same as the internal angle at K of the parallelogram? Or is it different?

Wait, in the parallelogram, the internal angle at K is between sides KJ and KL. In triangle K-L-J, the angle at K is between KJ and KL, which is exactly the internal angle at K of the parallelogram. So this angle should be 85 degrees. But earlier, we had a conflicting calculation where the internal angle at L was 30 degrees, which would make the internal angle at K = 150 degrees. This contradiction suggests that the given angle at L (30 degrees) is not the internal angle, but another angle involving the diagonal.

Wait, this brings us back to the original confusion. If the internal angle at L is not 30 degrees, but instead, the angle between ML and LK is 30 degrees, then we need to reconcile this with the other angle.

Let me redefine: Let's denote the internal angle at L as x, and the given angle at L between KL and LJ as 70 degrees. These two angles are related. In the parallelogram, the diagonal JL splits the angle at L into two parts: one part is the given 70 degrees, and the other part is the remaining angle.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonal JL divides the angle at L into two angles. Let me explain: the diagonal JL goes from J to L. At point L, the angle between ML and LK is x (internal angle), and the diagonal JL creates two angles: one between ML and JL, and one between JL and LK. The sum of these two angles is x.

But the problem states that one of these angles is 70 degrees. Let's assume that the angle between KL and JL is 70 degrees, and the other angle is x - 70 degrees. 

However, without knowing which part of the angle is 70 degrees, it's hard to proceed. But the problem specifies MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70 degrees, which is the angle at L between K, L, J. This is the angle between KL and JL, which is one part of the split angle at L.

So, if the internal angle at L is x, then x = angle between ML and LK = angle between ML and JL + angle between JL and LK = (some value) + 70 degrees. 

But we also know that in the parallelogram, the internal angle at L is x, and the internal angle at K is supplementary to x, so it's 180 - x. 

But from triangle K-L-J, we found that the internal angle at K is approximately 85 degrees, which would mean x = 180 - 85 = 95 degrees. So the internal angle at L is 95 degrees, and the angle between JL and LK is 70 degrees, so the other part (between ML and JL) would be 95 - 70 = 25 degrees. 

But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which is the internal angle at L, but according to this, it should be 95 degrees. This contradiction suggests that there's missing information or misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angle at L (30 degrees) is the angle between ML and JL, and the angle between JL and LK is 70 degrees, making the internal angle at L = 30 + 70 = 100 degrees. Then, the internal angle at K would be 80 degrees, since consecutive angles are supplementary. 

But how do we determine which part of the angle at L is given? The problem states MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which is the angle at L between M, L, K, i.e., between ML and LK, which is the internal angle at L. So this should be x = 30 degrees. But this contradicts the other condition where the angle between KL and JL is 70 degrees, leading to x = 30 = 70 + other part, which is impossible. 

This suggests that the given angles are inconsistent with each other, which is unlikely. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in interpreting the given angles.

Let me re-read the problem statement:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K), 30)

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J), 70)

So, Angle(M,L,K) is at L, between M, L, K: this is the angle between ML and LK, which is the internal angle at L. 

Angle(K,L,J) is at L, between K, L, J: this is the angle between KL and LJ, which is part of the angle at L, split by diagonal JL.

So, if the internal angle at L is x, then x = angle between ML and LK = angle between ML and JL + angle between JL and LK. One of these is given as 30 degrees, and the other is 70 degrees? Or one of them is 30, and the other is something else?

Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30, which is the angle between ML and LK (internal angle at L). MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70, which is the angle between KL and LJ. So, if the internal angle at L is 30 degrees, then the angle between KL and JL is 70 degrees, which would mean that the diagonal JL splits the internal angle at L into 30 and 70, but that would require the internal angle at L to be 30 + 70 = 100 degrees. But this contradicts the given 30 degrees.

This suggests that the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 is not the internal angle at L, but something else. But how?

Wait, perhaps the notation is different. Maybe Angle(M,L,K) is not the internal angle at L. Let me recall that in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(M,L,K) is the angle at L between points M, L, K. In a parallelogram, this would normally be the internal angle at L. But if the internal angle at L is 30 degrees, then the angle between KL and JL is 70 degrees, which would mean that the diagonal JL splits the internal angle into 30 and 70, totaling 100 degrees. But this would mean the internal angle at L is 100 degrees, not 30. This is conflicting.

This suggests that the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 is not the internal angle at L, but some other angle. But how?

Wait, perhaps the diagram is not a standard parallelogram, but a different quadrilateral? No, it's specified as a parallelogram. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 is not the internal angle, but the external angle? No, usually angles are measured as internal unless specified otherwise.

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me focus on the fact that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. 

Given that, if I can find one angle, I can find the rest. 

The problem gives two angles related to point L: one is the internal angle at L, and the other is an angle involving the diagonal. Let me try to use the triangle K-L-J.

In triangle K-L-J, we have:

- KL = 21
- KJ = 45
- angle at L = 70 degrees

From this, we can find the other angles in the triangle, and possibly relate them to the internal angles of the parallelogram.

As calculated earlier, using Law of Cosines, LJ ≈ 47.63. Then, using Law of Sines, angle at K in this triangle is approximately 85 degrees. This angle at K is the same as the internal angle at K of the parallelogram, since it's the angle between sides KJ and KL. 

So, if the internal angle at K is 85 degrees, then the internal angle at L is 180 - 85 = 95 degrees. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which should be the internal angle at L. This is a contradiction, suggesting that the given angle at L is not the internal angle, but another angle.

Wait, but if the internal angle at L is 95 degrees, and the given angle at L between KL and JL is 70 degrees, then the other part of the angle at L (between ML and JL) is 95 - 70 = 25 degrees. This fits with the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees? No, it would be 25 degrees. 

But the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30. This suggests that there is a miscalculation. Let me recheck the Law of Sines calculation.

In triangle K-L-J, with KL=21, KJ=45, angle at L=70 degrees.

Using Law of Sines:

sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(70)/45

We found LJ ≈ 47.63

So sin(angle at K) = (47.63/45) * sin(70) ≈ 1.058 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.996, so angle at K ≈ 85 degrees. 

If this is the internal angle at K, then the internal angle at L is 180 - 85 = 95 degrees. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30, which should be the internal angle at L. This suggests that there is an inconsistency in the problem, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 is not the internal angle at L, but the angle between ML and JL, which would be 25 degrees as calculated earlier, but the problem says 30. This is still inconsistent.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of resolution, I'll try to look at the answer choices. The question asks for m∠JKL, which is the internal angle at K. If from the triangle K-L-J, we found this angle to be approximately 85 degrees, which is not among the options. But the closest option is C. 80. Maybe due to rounding errors in the calculations, the actual value is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, let's try to solve it using the given angles and parallelogram properties.

Let me denote the internal angles of the parallelogram as follows:

Let the internal angle at L be x, and at K be y. Since consecutive angles are supplementary, x + y = 180 degrees.

From the problem, we have two angles at L: one is the internal angle x, and the other is an angle involving the diagonal, which is 70 degrees. Let me assume that the diagonal JL splits the angle at L into two parts: one part is 70 degrees, and the other part is x - 70 degrees.

But how does this relate to the rest? Let me consider triangle K-L-J. In this triangle, we have:

- angle at L is 70 degrees (given)
- sides KL = 21, KJ = 45

Using the Law of Sines in triangle K-L-J:

sin(70)/45 = sin(angle at K)/LJ = sin(angle at J)/KL

But we also know that in the parallelogram, the angle at K is y, which is supplementary to x. So if angle at K in the triangle is part of y, then perhaps it's related.

Wait, if the internal angle at K is y, then in the triangle K-L-J, the angle at K is part of y. But how much? It depends on how the diagonal JL intersects the parallelogram.

Actually, in the parallelogram, the diagonal JL divides it into two triangles: K-L-J and M-L-J. The angle at K in triangle K-L-J is the same as the internal angle at K of the parallelogram, which is y. So, if we can find y, that's our answer.

From the Law of Sines in triangle K-L-J:

sin(y)/LJ = sin(70)/45

But we need to find LJ. Let's use the Law of Cosines to express LJ in terms of x, and then relate it to y.

From the parallelogram, x + y = 180, so y = 180 - x.

Also, in the parallelogram, the diagonal JL can be calculated using the formula for the length of a diagonal in a parallelogram:

In a parallelogram, the length of diagonal JL can be found using the formula:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(x)

Wait, no. The formula for the diagonals in a parallelogram is:

For a parallelogram with sides a and b, and angle θ between them, the lengths of the diagonals are:

d1 = √(a² + b² + 2ab*cosθ)

d2 = √(a² + b² - 2ab*cosθ)

But in this case, the diagonal JL is from J to L. Let me confirm the formula.

Actually, the formula for the diagonals in a parallelogram is:

If the sides are a and b, and the angle between them is θ, then the diagonals are:

d1 = √(a² + b² + 2ab*cosθ)

d2 = √(a² + b² - 2ab*cosθ)

But in our case, the diagonal JL is one of the diagonals. Let's identify which sides and angle to use.

In the parallelogram, sides KL = 21 and KJ = 45. The angle between them is the internal angle at K, which is y = 180 - x. Wait, but the angle between sides KL and KJ is the internal angle at K, which is y. So, applying the formula:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(y)

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the diagonal joining K and L would be different. Wait, the diagonal JL connects J to L. Let me think about the sides adjacent to angle at L. The sides at L are LM and LK, with lengths 45 and 21, respectively, and the angle between them is x. So, using the formula for the diagonal JL, which connects J to L, it would be the diagonal opposite to the angle at L. 

Wait, the diagonal JL connects J to L. In the parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM. The formula for diagonal JL would be:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(angle between KL and KJ)

Wait, but the angle between KL and KJ is the internal angle at K, which is y. So:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(y)

But KL = 21, KJ = 45, y = 180 - x.

So:

JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(180 - x)

But cos(180 - x) = -cos(x), so:

JL² = 441 + 2025 + 2*21*45*cos(x) = 2466 + 1890*cos(x)

On the other hand, from the Law of Cosines in triangle K-L-J, we have:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(70°)

Wait, no. In triangle K-L-J, angle at L is 70 degrees, so:

JL² = KL² + KJ² - 2*KL*KJ*cos(70°)

Wait, this is from the Law of Cosines in triangle K-L-J, where angle at L is 70 degrees. So:

JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(70°)

Let me calculate this:

21² = 441, 45² = 2025, so 441 + 2025 = 2466

2*21*45 = 1890

So JL² = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°)

But from the parallelogram diagonal formula, JL² = 2466 + 1890*cos(x)

Setting these equal:

2466 + 1890*cos(x) = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°)

Subtract 2466 from both sides:

1890*cos(x) = -1890*cos(70°)

Divide both sides by 1890:

cos(x) = -cos(70°)

So, cos(x) = -cos(70°) → x = 180 - 70 = 110 degrees, or x = 180 + 70 = 250 degrees (which is not possible for a parallelogram angle). So x = 110 degrees.

Thus, the internal angle at L is 110 degrees, and the internal angle at K is 180 - 110 = 70 degrees. Wait, but this contradicts the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees. But according to this, it should be 110 degrees. 

But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which is supposed to be the internal angle at L. This suggests that there is a contradiction, but perhaps there is a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the steps. We equated the two expressions for JL²:

From parallelogram diagonal formula: JL² = 2466 + 1890*cos(x)

From triangle K-L-J: JL² = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°)

Setting equal: 2466 + 1890*cos(x) = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°)

So, 1890*cos(x) = -1890*cos(70°) → cos(x) = -cos(70°) → x = 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.

Thus, internal angle at L is 110 degrees, and at K is 70 degrees. But the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees. This suggests that the given angle is not the internal angle, but another angle. 

But if the internal angle at L is 110 degrees, and the given angle at L between KL and JL is 70 degrees, then the other part of the angle at L (between ML and JL) is 110 - 70 = 40 degrees. But the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30 degrees, which would be the angle between ML and LK (internal angle), but according to this, it's 110 degrees. 

This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I've misinterpreted the given angles. Given the time I've spent and the calculations, the internal angle at K is 70 degrees, which is one of the answer choices (option B). 

But let me verify this. If the internal angle at K is 70 degrees, then the internal angle at L is 110 degrees, and the angle between KL and JL is 70 degrees, as given. This would mean that the diagonal JL splits the internal angle at L (110 degrees) into 70 degrees and 40 degrees. This fits with the given angle of 70 degrees. 

But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(M
