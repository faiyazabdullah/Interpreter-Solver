MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E. There's a circle E, and some lines and arcs mentioned. The angle at point B, angle ABC, is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of the minor arc AC (which is x) and the major arc ADC (which is y). Also, it's given that when you add x and y, they equal 360 degrees, which makes sense because those two arcs together make up the whole circle. Then, subtracting y minus x gives 140 degrees. 

First, I remember that angles formed by tangents and secants can relate to the arcs they intercept. Since lines AB and BC are tangent to circle E, maybe there's something about the angle between two tangents? Wait, but angle ABC is given as 70 degrees. Let me recall the formula for the angle between two tangents drawn from a common external point. 

If two tangents are drawn from a single external point to a circle, the angle between them is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, the formula would be: angle = ½ (measure of larger arc - measure of smaller arc). In this case, since AB and BC are both tangents to circle E, then angle ABC should be related to the arcs intercepted by these tangents. But wait, the intercepted arcs... Hmm, maybe the angle at point B is formed by two tangents, so the angle is half the difference between the intercepted arcs. 

But the intercepted arcs here—since the tangents touch the circle at points A and C? Or maybe points D and another point? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: Arc(A,C) and Arc(A,D,C). So, the circle has points A, D, C on it. So, the arc AC could be minor or major depending on the position of D. 

Wait, but the problem says that Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are both tangent to Circle(E). Therefore, points A and C must lie on the circle, right? Because the tangent line touches the circle at exactly one point. So, line AB is tangent to circle E at point A, and line BC is tangent to circle E at point C? Wait, but the problem mentions Tangent(Line(A,B), Circle(E)) and Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(E)). That means each line is tangent to the circle. However, for a line to be tangent to a circle, it must touch the circle at exactly one point. So, line AB is tangent to circle E, so it touches the circle at one point. Similarly for line BC. But points A and C are also defined as points, so maybe they are the points of tangency? 

So, if line AB is tangent to circle E, then point A is the point of tangency. Similarly, line BC is tangent to circle E at point C. Therefore, points A and C lie on the circle, and lines AB and BC are tangent at those points. 

Therefore, angle ABC is formed by two tangent lines from point B to the circle E, touching at A and C. 

Then, according to the formula for the angle between two tangents, the measure of angle ABC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the major arc AC and the minor arc AC. So, angle ABC = ½ (major arc AC - minor arc AC). 

Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, then:

70 = ½ (y - x), since y is the major arc ADC and x is the minor arc AC. Wait, but the problem states that MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)) is x (the minor arc) and MeasureOf(Arc(A,D,C)) is y (the major arc). So, adding x + y equals 360, which makes sense because they're the entire circle. 

So, substituting into the angle formula:

70 = ½ (y - x)

Also, we know that x + y = 360. 

We have two equations:

1. x + y = 360
2. ½ (y - x) = 70 → y - x = 140

So, solving these equations. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: x + y = 360  
Equation 2: y - x = 140  

Adding equation 1 and equation 2:

x + y + y - x = 360 + 140  
Which simplifies to 2y = 500 → y = 250. Then substitute back into equation 1: x + 250 = 360 → x = 110. 

Wait, but the question asks for x, which is the measure of the minor arc AC. According to this calculation, x is 110 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 110. 

But let me check again. Is my reasoning correct?

Yes, because the angle between two tangents is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Since angle ABC is formed by two tangents at points A and C, the angle is half the difference between the major arc AC (which is y) and minor arc AC (which is x). Therefore, 70 = ½(y - x). And since the total circumference is 360, x + y = 360. Solving gives x = 110. So the answer should be C. 

Alternatively, let me think again: sometimes the intercepted arcs might be different. For example, if the angle is outside the circle, the formula is indeed half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So yes, that applies here. 

Another way to verify: suppose x is 110, then y is 250. Their difference is 140, half of that is 70, which matches the given angle. So that seems consistent. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C, which is 110. 

But let me check if there's any possibility that the intercepted arcs are different. Suppose the angle is formed by two tangents, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, the angle is half the difference between the major arc AC and minor arc AC. Hence, yes, the formula holds. 

So, conclusion: x is 110, so answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the degree measure of the **minor arc** $\widehat{AC}$ (denoted as $x$), we begin by analyzing the key geometric relationships implied by the constraints:

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

- Points **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, and **E** are defined.
- **Line AB** and **Line BC** are **tangents** to **Circle E**.
- This implies that **points A** and **C** lie **on the circle**, as tangents touch the circle at exactly one point.
- Thus, **line AB** is tangent at **point A**, and **line BC** is tangent at **point C**.
- The angle $\angle ABC = 70^\circ$, formed by these two tangents.

---

### Step 2: Applying the Tangent Angle Theorem

When two tangents are drawn from a common external point (here, point **B**) to a circle, the angle between the tangents is given by:

$$
\text{Angle} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Difference of intercepted arcs})
$$

In this scenario:
- The **intercepted arcs** are the **major arc AC** (denoted as $y$) and the **minor arc AC** (denoted as $x$).
- From the diagram and definitions, **arc ADC** is the **major arc**, implying that **arc AC** (as a minor arc) lies inside the rest of the circle.

Thus, the relationship becomes:

$$
\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}(y - x)
$$

Substituting the known value:

$$
70 = \frac{1}{2}(y - x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad y - x = 140 \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Using the Total Circumference of the Circle

Since **arc AC** and **arc ADC** cover the **entire circle**, their sum is:

$$
x + y = 360 \tag{2}
$$

Now, we solve the system of equations formed by (1) and (2):

From (1): $y - x = 140$  
From (2): $x + y = 360$

Adding both equations:

$$
(x + y) + (y - x) = 360 + 140 \\
2y = 500 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 250
$$

Substitute $y = 250$ into equation (2):

$$
x + 250 = 360 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 110
$$

---

### Final Result

The measure of the **minor arc AC** ($x$) is:

$$
\boxed{x = 110}
$$

---
