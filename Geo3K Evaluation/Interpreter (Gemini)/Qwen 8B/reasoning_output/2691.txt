MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle QRS with some constraints given. The question is asking for the length of QS, which is represented as "Q S" here. Let me parse through the information carefully.

First, the problem mentions that the triangle QRS is equilateral. Wait, but then there are several congruence conditions. Let me check again. The constraints include Equilateral(Triangle(Q,R,S)). Oh, so the triangle is equilateral. That means all sides are equal in length. But wait, there are also these equations involving x. Hmm, maybe I need to reconcile these two pieces of information?

Wait, let me list out all the given constraints:

1. Triangle(Q,R,S) – so points Q, R, S form a triangle.
2. Lines QR, RS, QS are sides of the triangle.
3. Length of QR is 5x. So LengthOf(Line(Q,R)) = 5x.
4. Length of RS is 6x minus 5. So LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = 6x -5.
5. Length of QS is 3x plus 10. So LengthOf(Line(Q,S)) = 3x +10.
6. Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(R,S)): So QR ≅ RS, meaning their lengths are equal.
7. Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(Q,S)): QR ≅ QS, so same length.
8. Congruent(Line(R,S), Line(Q,S)): RS ≅ QS, so same length.
9. Also, it says Equilateral(Triangle(Q,R,S)), so all sides are equal. Therefore, QR = RS = QS.

But hold on! If the triangle is equilateral, then all three sides must be equal. However, according to the given expressions, each side has a different expression in terms of x. Let me write down the equations based on the congruences.

From constraint 6: Length(QR) = Length(RS). From above, Length(QR) is 5x, and Length(RS) is 6x -5. So setting them equal:

5x = 6x -5  
Subtract 5x from both sides: 0 = x -5  
So x = 5.

Then, checking constraint 7: QR should equal QS. QR is 5x, QS is 3x +10. Plugging x=5:

QR = 5*5 =25  
QS = 3*5 +10 = 15 +10 =25. Okay, that works.

Similarly, constraint 8: RS equals QS. RS was 6x-5, which with x=5 is 6*5 -5 =30-5=25. And QS is 25. So that checks out too.

Additionally, since the triangle is equilateral, all sides must be equal. So QR=RS=QS=25. Which matches with our calculation. 

Therefore, the length of QS is 25. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 25. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I miss anything? The problem says "Find Q S." Assuming that refers to the length of QS, which we found as 25. The answer choices are A.5, B.15, C.20, D.25. So yes, D is correct.

Another way to think: Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal. So set all expressions equal. For example, QR = RS => 5x = 6x -5 gives x=5. Then QS is 3x+10 = 3*5 +10 = 25. Yep. So answer D.
