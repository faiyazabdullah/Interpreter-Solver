MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So we have a rectangle DEFG. First, I remember that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, which means each angle is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions some specific angles here. Let me parse the information again.

The question says that m∠EFD is 2x - 3 and m∠DFG is x + 12. Also, it states that when you add these two angles together, they equal 90 degrees. Wait, but hold on—since it's a rectangle, maybe those angles aren't the usual right angles? Hmm, perhaps there's something about the diagonals?

Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But do they form any specific angles? Let me think. If we draw diagonal DF, then triangle DFG and triangle DEF might come into play. Let me visualize the rectangle. Points D, E, F, G. Let me sketch mentally: D connected to E, E to F, F to G, G back to D. So sides DE, EF, FG, GD. Then the diagonals would be DF and EG. 

But the problem mentions angles at points F and D. Specifically, ∠EFD and ∠DFG. Let me focus on point F. At point F, there's angle EFD. Wait, so angle at F between points E, F, D. That would be part of the corner at F? Wait, no. Because in the rectangle, each corner is a right angle. So normally, at point F, the angle is between E-F-G. But here, angle EFD would involve points E, F, D. Wait, that seems like a different angle. Maybe it's formed by the diagonal?

Ah! So if we connect D to F (a diagonal), then at point F, there are two angles: one between E-F-G (which is 90 degrees) and another angle formed by the diagonal DF. Wait, but how does that work? Let me clarify.

In rectangle DEFG, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. The diagonal DF divides the rectangle into two triangles: triangle DFE and triangle DFG. Now, considering triangle DFE: angle at F is ∠EFD. Similarly, in triangle DFG, angle at F is ∠DFG. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals split the angles into two parts. Since the original angle at F is 90 degrees, splitting it with the diagonal DF would create two angles whose measures sum up to 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠EFD + ∠DFG = 90 degrees. Which matches the given equation: MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,D)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,G)) = 90. 

So according to the problem, m∠EFD = 2x - 3 and m∠DFG = x + 12. Their sum is 90. Therefore:

(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90  
Combine terms: 3x + 9 = 90  
Subtract 9: 3x = 81  
Divide by 3: x = 27  

Then substitute back to find m∠EFD: 2x - 3 = 2*27 -3 = 54 -3 = 51. 

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 51. So that should be the answer. Wait, but let me check again for errors. 

Wait, the problem also mentions RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)). Let me make sure that this condition is already satisfied. Angle DGF is supposed to be a right angle. But since it's a rectangle, angle at G is 90 degrees. However, angle DGF would be part of that. Wait, maybe that's redundant because of the rectangle's properties. But the problem includes that as a constraint, so maybe just confirming that the figure is indeed a rectangle. 

Another thing to check: Are there any other constraints? For example, maybe the angles mentioned relate to other properties. But since we've used the key equation given (sum of the two angles equals 90), and solved for x, leading us to 51, which is option A. 

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be A. Let me recheck my math:

Equation: 2x -3 + x +12 = 90 → 3x +9=90 → 3x=81 → x=27. Then 2x-3=54-3=51. Yes. So answer A. 

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option A is 51, which is present. So the correct answer is A. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that the two angles at point F (split by the diagonal) add up to 90 degrees, which is the original right angle at F. Hence, solving their sum gives x=27, leading to 51. So Final Answer: A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle EFD $ in rectangle $ DEFG $, we begin by analyzing the given conditions and applying fundamental geometric principles.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

We are told that quadrilateral $ DEFG $ is a **rectangle**, meaning:

- All interior angles are **right angles** (i.e., 90°).
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary.

Now consider the angles at vertex $ F $:

- $ \angle EFD $: This is the angle formed between segments $ FE $ and $ FD $.
- $ \angle DFG $: This is the angle formed between segments $ FD $ and $ FG $.

These two angles share side $ FD $, forming adjacent angles at vertex $ F $. Importantly, since the full angle at vertex $ F $ is a right angle (as part of the rectangle), the sum of these two angles must be:

$$
\angle EFD + \angle DFG = 90^\circ
$$

This relationship is explicitly stated in the problem:

$$
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3,\quad m\angle DFG = x + 12
$$

Thus,

$$
(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the Equation

$$
2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90 \\
3x + 9 = 90 \\
3x = 81 \\
x = 27
$$

Now substitute $ x = 27 $ into the expression for $ m\angle EFD $:

$$
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 = 2(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify Consistency

Check whether the second angle also fits within the context of the rectangle:

$$
m\angle DFG = x + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39
$$

Sum of both angles:

$$
51 + 39 = 90^\circ
$$

Which confirms consistency with the known property of rectangles.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
