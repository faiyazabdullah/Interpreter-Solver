Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out what's going on here. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided.

We have points T, W, Y, and X. All these points lie on a circle centered at X. Wait, no—the Circle(X) means that X is the center? Or is it that there's a circle named Circle(X)? Hmm, maybe the notation is that Circle(X) refers to a circle with center X. So, points T, W, Y are on the circumference of the circle centered at X. That makes sense because they mention PointLiesOnCircle(T,Circle(X)) etc. So, T, W, Y are all points on the circle with center X. 

Then, lines are drawn between various points: Line(T,X), Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(T,Y), Line(W,Y). Also, the lengths of these lines are equal. For example, IsRadiusOf(Line(T,X),Circle(X)) implies that the length of line TX is equal to the radius of the circle. Similarly for WX and XY. So TX = WX = XY, since they're radii of the same circle. Therefore, TX = WX = XY. 

So triangle TXY has sides TX, XY, and TY. But wait, TX and XY are both radii, so they are equal. However, TY isn't necessarily a radius unless Y is also connected to X via a radius. Wait, but Y is on the circle centered at X, so XY is a radius. So TX, WX, XY are all radii, hence equal in length. 

Now, we have triangles mentioned: Triangle(T,X,Y), Triangle(W,X,Y), Triangle(T,W,Y). And congruence between Triangle(T,W,Y) and Triangle(W,T,Y). Wait, the question says Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(W,T,Y)). But those two triangles are the same? Wait, Triangle(T,W,Y) and Triangle(W,T,Y) are the same triangle, just listed in different order. So perhaps that's a typo? Or maybe the intended meaning is that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to another triangle? Wait, the original statement says "Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(W,T,Y))". Maybe that's redundant, but perhaps the actual intent is something else. Wait, maybe there was a misformatting. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant to say that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y), which would make sense only if some condition holds. Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back: The user wrote:

"Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(W,T,Y))"

But Triangle(T,W,Y) and Triangle(W,T,Y) are the same triangle, as triangles are unordered sets of three points. So their congruence is trivially true. Therefore, maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be congruent to another triangle, like Triangle(W,T,Y) being congruent to Triangle(T,W,Y)? Not sure. Maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant to write Triangle(W,X,Y) or another triangle. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps I need to focus on other parts.

Let me proceed. Also, angles are given. MeasureOf(Angle(T,X,Y),4x) and MeasureOf(Angle(T,W,Y),Add(Mul(2,x),10)). So angle at point X in triangle TXY is 4x degrees, and angle at point Y in triangle TWY is (2x + 10) degrees. Wait, no—wait, Angle(T,X,Y) is the angle at point X between points T, X, Y. So vertex at X, with segments XT and XY. Similarly, Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at point Y between points T, W, Y. So vertex at Y, with segments YT and YW. 

Also, the problem asks to find x such that WTY ≅ TWY. Wait, the question says "W T Y ≅ T W Y". Wait, that's probably referring to triangles. So Triangle(W,T,Y) ≅ Triangle(T,W,Y). Which again, as before, are the same triangle. So that seems redundant. Unless there's a typo and it should be Triangle(W,T,Y) ≅ Triangle(T,W,X) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that Triangle(W,T,Y) is congruent to Triangle(T,W,Y)—which again is the same triangle. So this might be confusing. But maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Triangle(W,T,Y) is congruent to Triangle(T,W,X)? Or maybe there's a mislabeling. Let me think again. Given that the user wrote:

"Question: W T Y ≅ T W Y. Find x."

Assuming that "W T Y" and "T W Y" refer to triangles. In standard notation, Triangle(W,T,Y) and Triangle(T,W,Y) are the same triangle, so their congruence is trivial. Hence, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the problem actually meant that Triangle(W,T,Y) is congruent to another triangle, like Triangle(W,X,Y) or Triangle(T,W,X)? Alternatively, maybe the problem had a formatting error and the second triangle is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angles. For instance, angle WTY ≅ angle TWY. If that's the case, then those two angles are congruent. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose that angle WTY is congruent to angle TWY. Then, using triangle properties, maybe we can set up equations. 

But first, let me recap the given data:

All points T, W, Y lie on a circle with center X. Therefore, X is the center, so lines XT, XW, XY are all radii of the circle. Thus, XT = XW = XY. Therefore, triangles TXY, WXY, etc., are all isoceles triangles. 

Given that, let's look at triangle TXY. Since XT = XY, triangle TXY is isoceles with base TY and equal sides XT and XY. Therefore, the base angles at T and Y are equal. Wait, but the measure of angle at X is given as 4x. So angle at X is 4x. Then, the sum of angles in triangle TXY is 180°, so:

angle at X: 4x

angles at T and Y: let's call them both α. So:

4x + α + α = 180° => 4x + 2α = 180° => α = (180° - 4x)/2 = 90° - 2x.

Therefore, each of the base angles (at T and Y) is 90° - 2x.

Similarly, considering triangle TWY. Wait, but how do we know about triangle TWY? Well, points T, W, Y are all on the circle with center X. So TW is a chord of the circle, as well as WY and TY. 

But we also have that lines TW, WY, TY are chords. Also, given that the length of TX equals WX equals XY. Also, earlier statements said that LengthOf(Line(T,X)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,X)) equals LengthOf(Line(X,Y)). So TX = WX = XY. 

Moreover, we were told that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y). Which again, seems redundant. But perhaps there's more to it. Let me think differently.

Since TX = WX = XY, then triangle TXW is equilateral? Because TX = WX, and since X is the center, and T and W are points on the circle. Wait, TX and WX are radii, so yes, TX = WX, making triangle TXW isoceles with base TW and equal sides TX and WX. But unless angle at X is 60°, it wouldn't be equilateral. But we don't know the specific angles yet.

But then, we have angles involving points T, W, Y. The measure of angle at X (in triangle TXY) is 4x. Also, the measure of angle at Y in triangle TWY is (2x + 10) degrees. Wait, angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at Y between points T, W, Y. So in triangle TWY, angle at Y is (2x + 10) degrees. Also, the problem states that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y), which again seems redundant. However, maybe there's an alternative interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that Triangle(W,T,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,X,Y)? Let me check the original problem again. It says:

"Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(W,T,Y))"

Which is the same triangle. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct congruence is between Triangle(T,W,Y) and another triangle. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,X), or something similar. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to angle measures. Let me think: suppose that angle WTY is congruent to angle TWY. If that's the case, then in triangle TWY, angles at T and Y are congruent. So that would imply that triangle TWY is isoceles with legs WT and WY. Therefore, WT = WY. But since W and Y are both on the circle centered at X, the distance from W to Y would depend on the central angle between them. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in some triangles. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, since all points T, W, Y lie on the circle centered at X, then the distances from X to each of these points are equal. So, XT = XW = XY = r (radius).

In triangle TXY, which is isoceles with XT=XY=r. The angle at X is 4x. As previously established, the base angles at T and Y are 90° - 2x each.

Now, looking at triangle TWY. We need to relate its angles. The angle at Y is given as (2x + 10)°, according to the MeasureOf(Angle(T,W,Y),Add(Mul(2,x),10)). Wait, Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at Y between points T, W, Y. So in triangle TWY, angle at Y is 2x + 10. 

If we can find relationships between the sides and angles of triangle TWY, perhaps we can form equations. Also, since points T, W, Y are on the circle with center X, perhaps we can use properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. However, since all three points are on the circle, maybe there are some relations between arcs or central angles.

Additionally, we have that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y). Again, this seems redundant, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Wait, could it be that the problem meant that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(T,X,Y)? Or another triangle?

Alternatively, perhaps the congruence refers to the fact that triangles T,W,Y and W,T,Y are congruent, which they are because they are the same triangle. So this may not help us directly. 

Another thought: since all points T, W, Y are on the circle with center X, then the angles subtended by certain chords can be related. For example, the central angle over arc TW would be twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but maybe focusing on triangle TWY. Let me denote:

In triangle TWY, angle at Y is 2x + 10°, as given. Also, since points T, W, Y are on the circle centered at X, then the triangle TWY is inscribed in the circle. Wait, but the circle's center is X. So triangle TWY is inscribed in a circle with center X. Therefore, X is the circumcenter of triangle TWY. Wait, but for a triangle, the circumcenter is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors. However, since X is the center of the circle passing through T, W, Y, then X is indeed the circumcenter of triangle TWY. 

Therefore, the position of X relative to triangle TWY is important. Since X is the circumcenter, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle TWY meet at X. 

But how does this help us? Let me think. Since X is the circumcenter, then the distances from X to each vertex are equal (XT = XW = XY = r). 

Now, considering triangle TWY, with circumcenter X. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of TW passes through X, and similarly for other sides. 

Alternatively, since X is the circumcenter, the angles of the triangle can be related to the arcs. However, without knowing specific arcs, it might be challenging. 

But let's go back to triangle TWY. Let me denote the angles:

In triangle TWY, angle at Y is 2x + 10°, as per the given. Let me call this angle ∠TYW = 2x + 10°. Also, since X is the circumcenter, we can relate the central angles to the inscribed angles. 

For example, the central angle over arc TW would be twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. However, the inscribed angle would be ∠TWY or something else. Wait, the inscribed angle subtended by arc TW would be ∠TYW. Because if you take point Y on the circumference, then the angle at Y subtended by TW is half the measure of arc TW. 

So, if ∠TYW = 2x + 10°, then the arc TW would be 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°. 

Similarly, the central angle over arc TW would be equal to the measure of arc TW, which is 4x + 20°, since the central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. 

But since X is the center, the central angle for arc TW is ∠TXW. Because X is the center, so the angle between points T and W as viewed from X is the central angle for arc TW. Therefore, ∠TXW = 4x + 20°. 

But we also know that in triangle TXW, which is isoceles with sides XT = XW = r, the angle at X is ∠TXW. What is the value of that angle?

Earlier, we considered triangle TXY, where ∠TX Y = 4x. Now, if we can relate ∠TXW to other angles. 

Wait, points T, W, Y are all on the circle. Depending on the positions of these points, the arcs between them can vary. But since we have multiple angles and relationships, maybe we can express ∠TXW in terms of x. 

Alternatively, note that the total circumference corresponds to 360°, so the sum of arcs TW, WY, and YT should be 360°. But I'm not sure yet. 

Alternatively, since we have triangle TXY with ∠TX Y = 4x, and we might relate that to other angles. Let me see.

From earlier, in triangle TXY, which is isoceles with XT = XY, so ∠XTY = ∠X Y T = 90° - 2x. 

But how does this relate to other parts?

Wait, let me consider the entire circle. Points T, W, Y are on the circle centered at X. So, the positions of these points define arcs. Let me think about the arcs between them. 

Suppose we consider the arc from T to W, arc from W to Y, and arc from Y to T. These arcs add up to 360°. 

Earlier, we found that arc TW corresponds to central angle ∠TXW = 4x + 20°, as derived from the inscribed angle ∠TYW = 2x + 10°. 

Now, what about the other arcs? For example, arc WY. To find that, perhaps we can use another inscribed angle. 

Looking at triangle TWY, we can find other angles. Let me try to compute the angles of triangle TWY. 

In triangle TWY, we know angle at Y is 2x + 10°. Let's denote the other angles. Let me call ∠WTY as β and ∠TWY as γ. 

Sum of angles in triangle TWY is 180°, so:

β + γ + (2x + 10°) = 180° → β + γ = 180° - (2x + 10°) = 170° - 2x.

But I need more information to relate β and γ. 

However, since X is the circumcenter of triangle TWY, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides pass through X. This might not directly help unless we have more info. 

Alternatively, since X is the center of the circle, then for example, the line XO (where O is the center, which is X here) is perpendicular to the tangent at that point. But I don't see how that applies here. 

Wait, but maybe we can consider the central angles corresponding to other arcs. For instance, the arc from Y to T. Let's think about inscribed angles subtended by that arc. 

Take point W on the circle. The inscribed angle subtended by arc YT would be ∠YWT. Let me check. The inscribed angle subtended by arc YT at point W would be ∠YW T. 

So, ∠YW T = ½ * measure of arc YT. 

Similarly, we can relate this angle to other variables. 

But how can we find this angle? 

Alternatively, since we have triangle TXY with known angles, maybe we can find other angles. 

Let me recall that in triangle TXY, angle at X is 4x, and angles at T and Y are 90° - 2x each. 

Now, if I consider the position of point W on the circle. How is it placed relative to T and Y? 

Possibly, points T, W, Y are arranged around the circle in some order. Without loss of generality, assume they are placed in the order T-W-Y-T along the circumference. 

Then, the arc TW is as discussed before, with measure 4x + 20°, arc WY would be something, and arc YT would be something else. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. For example, considering triangle TWY and triangle TXY. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find expressions for other angles. 

We know that in triangle TWY, angle at Y is 2x + 10°, which we related to arc TW being 4x + 20°. Now, what about arc YT? 

Arc YT is subtended by the inscribed angle at point W, which is ∠YWT. Let me denote that angle as θ. Then, θ = ½ * arc YT. 

But how do I find θ? 

Alternatively, consider triangle TWY. If we can find another angle in terms of x, we can create equations. 

Wait, but we also have that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y). Wait, again, this seems redundant. Unless there's a property I'm missing. 

Wait, maybe the congruence implies that certain sides are equal. For example, if Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(W,T,Y), then corresponding sides are equal. But since they are the same triangle, this is always true. So this doesn't give new info. 

Perhaps the problem meant to state that Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y)? Let me assume that for a moment. If that's the case, then corresponding sides would be equal. 

Assume Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y). Then, corresponding sides would be equal. For example, side TW in Triangle(T,W,Y) would correspond to side WX in Triangle(W,X,Y). So TW = WX. But WX is a radius, so TW = r. Similarly, other sides would be equal. 

But if TW = WX = r, then triangle TWX would be isoceles with TW = WX. Which is already true since TW is a chord of the circle with center X, and WX is a radius. Wait, but TW is not necessarily equal to WX. Because TW is a chord, while WX is a radius. Unless the chord TW is equal in length to the radius. 

This might be a way to get an equation. Let me explore this possibility. 

If Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y), then sides TW = WX, WY = XY, and TY = XY. 

Since WX = XY = r, then TW = WX = r, WY = XY = r, and TY = XY = r. So all these chords TW, WY, TY are equal to the radius. 

But TW, WY, TY are chords of the circle. For a chord of length equal to the radius, the central angle subtended by the chord can be calculated. 

The formula for the length of a chord is: chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. 

So if chord TW = r, then:

r = 2r sin(θ/2) → 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 1/2 → θ/2 = 30° → θ = 60°. 

Thus, the central angle subtended by chord TW is 60°, and similarly for chords WY and TY. 

So, if all three chords TW, WY, TY are equal to r, then their central angles are each 60°, implying that the arcs TW, WY, TY are each 60°, totaling 180°, which would mean that points T, W, Y are spaced every 60° around the circle. But this would make the total circle 180°, which is impossible, since a full circle is 360°. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y) might be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the congruence is between other triangles. Let me think again. 

The problem mentions Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(W,T,Y)), which is the same triangle, so this gives no new info. Perhaps the problem had a typo, and it should be Congruent(Triangle(T,W,Y),Triangle(T,X,Y))? Let's try that. 

If Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(T,X,Y), then their corresponding sides are equal. So:

Side TW in Triangle(T,W,Y) corresponds to side TX in Triangle(T,X,Y). So TW = TX = r. 

Similarly, side WY corresponds to side XY = r. And side TY corresponds to side TY, which would imply that TY = TY, trivially. 

So this would mean that TW = r and WY = r. 

Again, this leads us to the same conclusion as before: chords TW and WY are equal to r, leading to central angles of 60°, but this would require that arcs TW and WY are each 60°, and arc TY would be... ?

Wait, but if arc TW is 60°, arc WY is 60°, then arc TY would be arc TW + arc WY = 120°, assuming points T-W-Y are in sequence. But then, the total circle would have arc TW + arc WY + arc YT = 60° + 60° + 120° = 360°, which works. 

Wait, but if arc YT is 120°, then the central angle for arc YT is 120°, so the inscribed angle subtended by YT would be half of that, 60°. 

Now, going back to triangle TWY. Earlier, we had that angle at Y (∠TYW) is 2x + 10°, and this is equal to half the measure of arc TW. Because ∠TYW is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TW. 

Wait, if arc TW is 60°, then ∠TYW = ½ * arc TW = 30°. So 2x + 10° = 30° → 2x = 20 → x = 10. But 10 is option D. However, let's verify if this fits with other conditions. 

But wait, earlier I assumed that arc TW is 60°, based on TW = r. But why would that be true? Only if Triangle(T,W,Y) ≅ Triangle(T,X,Y), which I assumed due to a possible typo. However, this assumption might not be valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the congruence is between Triangle(T,W,Y) and another triangle. Let me think again. 

Another approach: since all points are on the circle with center X, and TX = XW = XY = r. Let me consider triangle TWY. 

In triangle TWY, sides TW, WY, TY are chords of the circle. Let me calculate their lengths in terms of r and angles. 

Using the chord length formula: chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. 

So, for example, length of TW = 2r sin(∠TXW / 2), since ∠TXW is the central angle subtended by arc TW. 

Similarly, length of WY = 2r sin(∠WXY / 2), and length of TY = 2r sin(∠TXY / 2). 

But we know that ∠TXY is given as 4x. So, TY = 2r sin(4x / 2) = 2r sin(2x). 

Also, in triangle TWY, we have angles. From earlier, ∠TYW = 2x + 10°, and we need to relate this to the chord lengths. 

But how? 

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines on triangle TWY. 

Law of Sines says that in any triangle, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. 

Applying this to triangle TWY:

TW / sin(∠TYW) = WY / sin(∠WTY) = TY / sin(∠TWY)

But we don't know the other angles or sides. However, we might relate some of them using the circle properties. 

For example, ∠TYW = 2x + 10°, as given. Let's denote this as angle Y = 2x + 10°. 

Let me denote angle at T as ∠WTY = β, and angle at W as ∠TWY = γ. 

So, β + γ + (2x + 10°) = 180° ⇒ β + γ = 170° - 2x. 

Now, using the Law of Sines:

TW / sin(∠TYW) = TY / sin(∠TWY) → TW / sin(2x + 10°) = TY / sin γ.

But I don't know γ or β. 

But maybe I can relate TW and TY using the circle. 

As before, TW is a chord subtended by central angle ∠TXW, which we denoted earlier as 4x + 20° (from the inscribed angle ∠TYW = 2x + 10°). Wait, earlier I thought that ∠TYW is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TW, so the central angle would be 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°, which is ∠TXW. 

So, ∠TXW = 4x + 20°. 

Similarly, the length of TW = 2r sin(∠TXW / 2) = 2r sin((4x + 20°)/2) = 2r sin(2x + 10°). 

Meanwhile, the length of TY is 2r sin(2x), as previously derived. 

So, substituting into the Law of Sines ratio:

TW / sin(2x + 10°) = TY / sin γ → [2r sin(2x + 10°)] / sin(2x + 10°) = TY / sin γ → 2r = TY / sin γ → TY = 2r sin γ.

But we also have that TY = 2r sin(2x). Therefore:

2r sin(2x) = 2r sin γ → sin γ = sin(2x). 

So, either γ = 2x + 360°n or γ = 180° - 2x + 360°n, for integer n. Since angles in a triangle are between 0° and 180°, we can ignore the periodicity and consider:

Case 1: γ = 2x  
Case 2: γ = 180° - 2x  

Let's examine both cases.

Case 1: γ = 2x  
Then, from earlier, β + γ = 170° - 2x → β + 2x = 170° - 2x → β = 170° - 4x. 

But in triangle TWY, angle at T is β = 170° - 4x. Also, since angle at T is part of triangle TWY, it must be positive. So 170° - 4x > 0 → x < 32.5°. 

Additionally, angle γ = 2x must be positive, so x > 0°. 

Now, what else can we deduce? 

Let me recall that in triangle TWY, angle at W is γ = 2x, angle at Y is 2x + 10°, and angle at T is β = 170° - 4x. 

But we can also relate this to the circle. For example, the angle at W in triangle TWY is γ = 2x. Let's see if this angle relates to some central angle. 

Angle at W, which is ∠TWY, is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TY. Because when you have point W on the circle, the angle ∠TWY subtends arc TY. 

So, ∠TWY = ½ * measure of arc TY. 

Therefore, arc TY = 2*γ = 2*(2x) = 4x. 

But arc TY is also related to the central angle ∠TX Y, which is given as 4x. Wait, ∠TX Y is the central angle subtended by arc TY, right? Because X is the center, so the central angle over arc TY is ∠TX Y, which is given as 4x. 

So, arc TY = 4x, and from above, arc TY = 4x. This matches! So this case holds. 

So Case 1 is valid. 

Now, what about Case 2: γ = 180° - 2x. 

Substituting into β + γ = 170° - 2x → β + (180° - 2x) = 170° - 2x → β = 170° - 2x - 180° + 2x = -10°, which is impossible. So Case 2 is invalid. 

Therefore, only Case 1 is valid: γ = 2x. 

Thus, we have γ = 2x, and from earlier, angle at W is γ = 2x. 

Now, what else can we derive? 

We know that in triangle TWY, angles are: 
- at Y: 2x + 10°
- at W: 2x
- at T: 170° - 4x

But we can also consider other relationships. For example, the sum of angles in triangle TWY is 180°, which we've already used. 

Now, let's think about the rest of the diagram. 

We also have triangle TXY with angles at X = 4x, at T = 90° - 2x, and at Y = 90° - 2x. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Let me consider the entire circle. The arcs between points T, W, Y. 

We have arc TW = 4x + 20° (as derived earlier from the inscribed angle at Y). Arc TY = 4x (from the inscribed angle at W). Arc WY can be calculated as follows. 

Total circle is 360°, so:

arc TW + arc WY + arc YT = 360°  
=> (4x + 20°) + arc WY + 4x = 360°  
=> 8x + 20° + arc WY = 360°  
=> arc WY = 340° - 8x

Now, arc WY is subtended by the central angle ∠WX Y. Let's calculate this central angle. 

But what is ∠WX Y? It's the central angle for arc WY, which is equal to arc WY = 340° - 8x. 

Now, let's consider triangle WXY. Since points W and Y are on the circle with center X, triangle WXY is isoceles with sides XW = XY = r. 

The angle at X is ∠WXY = arc WY = 340° - 8x. 

But in triangle WXY, the sum of angles is 180°. So:

∠WXY + ∠XWY + ∠XYW = 180°

But ∠XWY and ∠XYW are the base angles of the isoceles triangle WXY, so they are equal. Let's call each of them δ. 

So:

(340° - 8x) + 2δ = 180°  
→ 2δ = 180° - (340° - 8x) = 180° - 340° + 8x = -160° + 8x  
→ δ = (-160° + 8x)/2 = -80° + 4x

But angles cannot be negative. So:

-80° + 4x > 0 → 4x > 80° → x > 20°.

Also, since arc WY = 340° - 8x must be positive, 340° - 8x > 0 → x < 340°/8 = 42.5°. 

So x is between 20° and 42.5°. 

Now, what is δ? δ represents the base angles of triangle WXY, which are ∠XWY and ∠XYW. 

But ∠XWY is an inscribed angle subtended by arc XY. Wait, no. ∠XWY is at point W, between points X, W, Y. So it's an inscribed angle subtended by arc XY. 

Wait, the inscribed angle at W subtended by arc XY would be ∠XWY. 

The measure of ∠XWY is equal to half the measure of arc XY. 

But arc XY is the arc from X to Y, but X is the center, so arc XY is undefined? Wait, no—points X, Y are on the circle? No, X is the center, not on the circle. Wait, hold on! Wait, X is the center of the circle, so it's not on the circle. Therefore, points T, W, Y are on the circle, but X is inside the circle. 

So, arc XY is not defined because X is not on the circle. Wait, this suggests an error in my previous reasoning. 

When I considered triangle WXY, I assumed that ∠XWY is an inscribed angle subtended by arc XY, but since X is the center, arc XY is not part of the circle. So my previous reasoning about δ being an inscribed angle is wrong. 

Hmm, this indicates a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me backtrack. 

In triangle WXY, points W and Y are on the circle, and X is the center. So triangle WXY has vertices at X (the center), W, and Y. This is an isoceles triangle with XW = XY = r. The angle at X is ∠WXY, which is the central angle between points W and Y, which we previously determined as arc WY = 340° - 8x. 

The base angles at W and Y are ∠XWY and ∠XYW. Let me calculate them using the triangle's angle sum. 

As before, ∠WXY = 340° - 8x, and the other two angles sum to 180° - (340° - 8x) = 8x - 160°. Each base angle is (8x - 160°)/2 = 4x - 80°. 

But angles can't be negative, so 4x - 80° > 0 → x > 20°, which aligns with earlier. 

Now, what is ∠XWY? It is an angle at point W between points X, W, Y. This angle is not an inscribed angle, because X is the center. Instead, it's an angle in the triangle WXY. 

But perhaps we can relate this angle to other parts. For example, ∠XWY is the angle between segment WX and WY. Since WX is a radius, and WY is a chord. 

But how to relate this to other angles? 

Alternatively, since we have ∠XWY = 4x - 80°, and this angle might be related to other angles in the diagram. 

But I'm not seeing a direct connection yet. 

Let me think about other relationships. 

Previously, in triangle TWY, we found that γ = 2x, which is ∠TWY. 

But ∠TWY is the angle at point W between points T, W, Y. This is the same as ∠XWY? No, because ∠TWY is part of triangle TWY, while ∠XWY is part of triangle WXY. 

Wait, but ∠TWY and ∠XWY are adjacent angles at point W. Let me visualize this. At point W, there are several angles: 

- ∠XWY (part of triangle WXY) 
- ∠TWY (part of triangle TWY) 
- Possibly others depending on the configuration. 

Assuming that points T, W, Y are arranged on the circle, and X is the center. 

At point W, the angle ∠TWY is formed by points T, W, Y. The angle ∠XWY is formed by points X, W, Y. 

These two angles might be supplementary if points T, X are positioned such that lines WT and WX are on opposite sides of W. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

However, since X is the center, and W is on the circle, then line WX is a radius extending from W to X. 

If we consider the line from W to X, then ∠XWY is the angle between WX and WY, while ∠TWY is the angle between TW and WY. 

Unless points T, X are aligned in some way, these angles might not be directly related. 

Alternatively, if we consider the straight line through W and X, then ∠TWY and ∠XWY might add up to some value. 

But this requires knowing the position of T relative to line WX. 

This seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. 

Let me recall that in triangle TWY, we have ∠TWY = 2x, and ∠XWY = 4x - 80°. Are these related? 

Maybe not directly. However, if we assume that points T, W, X are arranged such that line WT passes through X, but that would require that T lies on the extension of WX beyond W, which may not be the case. 

Alternatively, if T is diametrically opposite to W, but that would make TW a diameter, but we don't know that. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation between angles in triangle TWY and triangle WXY. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me return to the earlier equations. 

We have from the arc WY = 340° - 8x, and from the triangle WXY, the base angles are 4x - 80°. 

But also, in triangle TWY, we have ∠TWY = 2x. 

If I can relate ∠TWY to ∠XWY, perhaps through some geometric relationship. 

Assume that ∠TWY and ∠XWY are supplementary. That is, ∠TWY + ∠XWY = 180°. 

If that's the case, then:

2x + (4x - 80°) = 180°  
6x - 80° = 180°  
6x = 260°  
x = 260° / 6 ≈ 43.33°

But this is outside the earlier constraint that x > 20° and x < 42.5°, so this would violate x < 42.5°. Hence, this assumption is likely incorrect. 

Alternatively, if ∠TWY = ∠XWY, then 2x = 4x - 80° → -2x = -80° → x = 40°. 

But then, checking the arc WY = 340° - 8x = 340 - 320 = 20°. So arc WY is 20°, which is possible. 

But what about other constraints? Let's check if x=40° satisfies other conditions. 

But earlier, we had that arc TW = 4x + 20° = 4*40 + 20 = 180°, arc TY = 4x = 160°, arc WY = 20°. Total arc: 180 + 20 + 160 = 360°, which works. 

Now, what about the angles in triangle TWY? With x=40°, angle at Y is 2x+10 = 90°, angle at W is 2x = 80°, angle at T is 170 - 4x = 170 - 160 = 10°. Sum: 90 + 80 + 10 = 180°, which checks out. 

Also, in triangle WXY, base angles are 4x - 80 = 160 - 80 = 80°, so both ∠XWY and ∠XYW are 80°, and the angle at X is 340 - 8x = 340 - 320 = 20°, which adds up to 80 + 80 + 20 = 180°, correct. 

So, this seems consistent. 

But what about the congruence condition mentioned in the problem? The problem states that Triangle(T,W,Y) is congruent to Triangle(W,T,Y), which as discussed earlier is trivial. However, perhaps there's another condition I missed. 

Wait, but earlier, we assumed that ∠TWY = ∠XWY, which led us to x=40°. But why would ∠TWY = ∠XWY? 

Maybe there's a reason for this. Since both angles are at point W, and possibly share some relation. 

Let me think: ∠TWY is the angle between TW and WY, while ∠XWY is the angle between WX and WY. If line TW is aligned with line WX, then ∠TWY would be equal to ∠XWY. But that would require that T, W, and X are colinear, i.e., T lies on the line extended from WX. 

But since T is on the circle, and X is the center, then if T is on the line WX extended, it would mean that T is diametrically opposite to W. But since WX is a radius, the diameter would extend from W through X to the other side. So if T is diametrically opposite to W, then XT would be a diameter, making TX = 2r. But earlier, we have that TX is a radius, so TX = r. This contradicts, unless the radius is zero, which it isn't. 

Therefore, this assumption is incorrect. Hence, why did we arrive at x=40°? Because we assumed ∠TWY = ∠XWY, which might not be justified. 

But given that this led to a consistent solution, and the problem includes a congruence condition that might indirectly enforce this, perhaps this is the correct path. 

Let me check if there are other ways to relate ∠TWY and ∠XWY. 

Since ∠TWY is part of triangle TWY, and ∠XWY is part of triangle WXY. If there's a relationship between these two angles, it might come from other constraints. 

But without additional information, it's difficult to establish. However, since our calculation gave x=40°, and this satisfies all the derived equations, and the answer choices include D=10, C=5, B=4, A=2. Wait, but 40° is not among the options. The options are A.2, B.4, C.5, D.10. 

Wait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me double-check. 

Earlier, when I assumed that ∠TWY = ∠XWY, I got x=40°, which isn't among the options. This suggests an error in that assumption. 

Let me revisit the earlier steps. 

We had from triangle TWY: ∠TWY = 2x, and from triangle WXY: ∠XWY = 4x - 80°. If these angles are related, perhaps through some geometric property. 

But what if the line TX intersects with other elements? 

Alternatively, consider that ∠TWY and ∠XWY are vertical angles or something similar. But I don't see how. 

Alternatively, since X is the center, and T is on the circle, then line XT is a radius. If line TW is such that ∠XWY is related to ∠TWY, perhaps through some symmetry. 

Alternatively, let's consider the entire diagram. 

Points T, W, Y on the circle with center X. 

From earlier, arc TW = 4x + 20°, arc TY = 4x, arc WY = 340° - 8x. 

Also, in triangle TWY, we have angles: at Y: 2x + 10°, at W: 2x, at T: 170° - 4x. 

Now, what about the other angles in the diagram? 

In triangle TXY, we have angles at X: 4x, at T: 90° - 2x, at Y: 90° - 2x. 

Now, let's consider the angle at Y in triangle TXY, which is 90° - 2x. This angle is ∠XYT. 

What is ∠XYT? It is the angle at Y between points X, Y, T. Since X is the center, this angle is formed by the radius XY and the chord YT. 

This angle might be related to the inscribed angle subtended by arc XT. Wait, but X is the center, so arc XT is not on the circle. 

Alternatively, since ∠XYT is part of triangle TXY, which we've already analyzed. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Alternatively, consider the angle at Y in triangle TWY, which is 2x + 10°, and compare it to ∠XYT = 90° - 2x. 

Are these angles related? 

For example, if ∠XYT + ∠TYW = 180°, or some other relationship. 

Let me check: ∠XYT is at Y, between X, Y, T. ∠TYW is at Y, between T, Y, W. These two angles are adjacent, forming the angle between X, Y, W. 

So, ∠XYT + ∠TYW = ∠XYW. 

But ∠XYW is part of triangle WXY, which we previously found to have angle at Y of 4x - 80°. 

So:

∠XYT + ∠TYW = ∠XYW  
(90° - 2x) + (2x + 10°) = 4x - 80°  
90° - 2x + 2x + 10° = 4x - 80°  
100° = 4x - 80°  
4x = 180°  
x = 45° 

Ah! This gives x = 45°, but this is not one of the answer choices either. The options are A.2, B.4, C.5, D.10. 

Wait, this suggests another inconsistency. Where is the mistake here? 

Let me recheck the calculation:

∠XYT is 90° - 2x.  
∠TYW is 2x + 10°.  
Their sum is ∠XYW, which is 4x - 80°. 

So:

(90° - 2x) + (2x + 10°) = 4x - 80°  
90° + 10° = 4x - 80°  
100° = 4x - 80°  
4x = 180°  
x = 45°. 

But 45° is not among the options. This suggests that there is an error in the assumptions made. 

Let me trace back. Why did I assume that ∠XYW = 4x - 80°? 

Earlier, in triangle WXY, we had:

∠WXY = 340° - 8x  
Base angles are (8x - 160°)/2 = 4x - 80°. 

So ∠XYW = 4x - 80°. 

But this assumes that the base angles are ∠XYW and ∠XWY. But in reality, in triangle WXY, the base angles are at W and Y. So ∠XWY and ∠XYW are the base angles. 

But ∠XYW is at Y, between X, Y, W. 

Yes, so ∠XYW is one of the base angles, which is 4x - 80°. 

And ∠XYT is at Y, between X, Y, T. 

So their sum is ∠XYW + ∠XYT = ∠XYW + ∠XYT = ? 

Wait, no. ∠XYT is at Y between X, Y, T. ∠TYW is at Y between T, Y, W. Together, they form the angle at Y between X, Y, W, which is ∠XYW. 

So:

∠XYT + ∠TYW = ∠XYW  
(90° - 2x) + (2x + 10°) = 4x - 80°  
100° = 4x - 80°  
4x = 180°  
x = 45°. 

But this is not among the answer choices. This suggests that there is a miscalculation somewhere. 

Let me check the earlier steps. 

Where did I get ∠XYW = 4x - 80°? 

From triangle WXY, where ∠WXY = 340° - 8x, and the other two angles are (8x - 160°)/2 = 4x - 80°. 

But how did I get ∠WXY = 340° - 8x? 

That came from the total circle: arc TW + arc WY + arc YT = 360°, where arc TW = 4x + 20°, arc YT = 4x, so arc WY = 360° - (4x + 20° + 4x) = 360° - 8x - 20° = 340° - 8x. 

Yes, that seems correct. 

Then, ∠WXY is the central angle for arc WY, which is 340° - 8x. 

So, in triangle WXY, the angles are:  
∠WXY = 340° - 8x  
∠XWY = 4x - 80°  
∠XYW = 4x - 80°  

Sum: (340 - 8x) + (4x - 80) + (4x - 80) = 340 - 8x + 8x - 160 = 180°, which is correct. 

So that part is correct. 

Then, the equation from the angle addition at Y gives x = 45°, which is not in the options. This suggests that there is a flaw in the assumptions. 

Let me revisit the initial assumption about arc TW. 

We said that ∠TYW = 2x + 10° is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TW, hence arc TW = 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°. 

But is this correct? 

An inscribed angle subtended by arc TW would be an angle whose vertex is on the circumference and subtends arc TW. In this case, ∠TYW has vertex at Y, and subtends arc TW. Yes, because Y is on the circumference, and the angle is formed by points T, Y, W. 

So, yes, ∠TYW is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TW, so its measure is half the measure of arc TW. 

Therefore, arc TW = 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°, which is correct. 

So, this part is correct. 

Then, arc TY = 4x, as derived from the inscribed angle at W. 

Wait, how did we get arc TY = 4x? 

From earlier, in triangle TWY, we had ∠TWY = 2x, which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TY. 

Wait, ∠TWY is at point W, subtended by arc TY. So, arc TY = 2*∠TWY = 2*(2x) = 4x. 

Yes, that is correct. 

So, arc TY = 4x. 

Then, arc TW = 4x + 20°, arc TY = 4x, and arc WY = 340° - 8x. 

So, adding them: 4x + 20 + 4x + (340 - 8x) = 360°, which checks out. 

So, this is correct. 

But then, the equation from the angle at Y gives x = 45°, which is not an option. This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem setup or in my understanding. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the angle addition. 

Let me recheck:

∠XYT = 90° - 2x (from triangle TXY)  
∠TYW = 2x + 10° (given)  
Their sum = ∠XYW = 4x - 80° (from triangle WXY)  
So: 90 - 2x + 2x + 10 = 4x - 80  
100 = 4x - 80  
4x = 180  
x = 45°. 

This seems correct. 

But since this is not among the options, I must have made a wrong assumption. 

Let me reconsider the assumption about ∠XYT. 

In triangle TXY, angle at Y is ∠XYT. But is this angle really 90° - 2x? 

Yes, because in triangle TXY, which is isoceles with XT = XY, the base angles at T and Y are equal. 

Since the angle at X is 4x, the other two angles are (180 - 4x)/2 = 90 - 2x. So, ∠XYT = 90 - 2x. 

This is correct. 

So, this suggests that there is a conflict, and the only way to resolve it is to realize that my earlier assumption about the inscribed angle for ∠TWY is incorrect. 

Wait, let me re-examine the inscribed angle subtended by arc TY. 

∠TWY is at point W, and subtends arc TY. But is this correct? 

The inscribed angle subtended by arc TY at point W would be ∠TWY. Yes, because the angle at W between points T and Y is subtended by arc TY. 

So, this is correct. Hence, arc TY = 2*∠TWY = 4x. 

But if this leads to x = 45°, which is not an option, then perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I have misunderstood the diagram. 

Let me try to consider the possibility that the angle at Y in triangle TWY is not 2x + 10°, but something else. 

Wait, the problem says: MeasureOf(Angle(T,W,Y),Add(Mul(2,x),10)). So, Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at Y, between T, W, Y. So, it is ∠TYW, which we said is 2x + 10°. 

But maybe it's the angle at W? No, the notation Angle(T,W,Y) means the angle at W, between T, W, Y. Wait, no! Wait, in standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B. So Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at W, between T, W, Y. So it is ∠TWY, not ∠TYW. 

Oh! Here is the critical mistake! 

I incorrectly interpreted Angle(T,W,Y) as the angle at Y, but it is actually the angle at W! 

This changes everything. Let me correct this. 

The measure of Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at W, between T, W, Y. So it is ∠TWY, not ∠TYW. 

This was the key error! 

Let me restart from this correction. 

Correcting this, let's redefine:

Angle(T,W,Y) is the angle at W, between T, W, Y. So it is ∠TWY. 

Previously, I incorrectly associated it with ∠TYW, which led to errors. 

With this correction, let's redo the analysis. 

First, in triangle TWY, the angle at W is ∠TWY = 2x + 10°. 

This angle is an inscribed angle subtended by arc TY. 

So, arc TY = 2 * ∠TWY = 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°. 

Previously, I had arc TY = 4x, which was incorrect. 

Now, let's recalculate arc TW, arc WY, and arc YT. 

We have:

Arc TW: previously calculated as 4x + 20°, but this was from ∠TYW, which was wrong. Now, let's re-evaluate. 

Actually, to find arc TW, we need to look at an inscribed angle subtended by it. 

Which angle subtends arc TW? 

For example, ∠TYW is at Y, subtending arc TW. 

Wait, no: ∠TYW is at Y, between T, Y, W, so it subtends arc TW. 

But earlier, I thought that ∠TYW was 2x + 10°, but that was incorrect. 

Wait, let's clarify: 

Angle(T,W,Y) is ∠TWY = 2x + 10°, which is at W, subtending arc TY. 

To find arc TW, we need to find an inscribed angle subtending it. 

For example, ∠TYW at Y, subtending arc TW. 

So, ∠TYW is an inscribed angle subtending arc TW. 

Therefore, arc TW = 2 * ∠TYW. 

But what is ∠TYW? 

∠TYW is the angle at Y, between T, Y, W. 

This angle is part of triangle TWY. 

Let me denote ∠TYW as α. 

So, in triangle TWY, angles are: 

- At W: ∠TWY = 2x + 10°  
- At Y: ∠TYW = α  
- At T: β  

Sum: (2x + 10) + α + β = 180° → α + β = 170 - 2x. 

Now, ∠TYW = α is an inscribed angle subtending arc TW, so arc TW = 2α. 

Also, arc TY = 2 * ∠TWY = 2*(2x + 10°) = 4x + 20°. 

Now, let's find arc TW. 

To find arc TW, we need to determine α. 

How? Let's consider other relationships. 

We also have triangle TXY, where angle at X is 4x, and angles at T and Y are 90° - 2x. 

Let me consider the angle at Y in triangle TXY, which is ∠XYT = 90° - 2x. This is the angle at Y between X, Y, T. 

This angle is also an inscribed angle subtending arc XT. But since X is the center, arc XT is not on the circle. 

Alternatively, ∠XYT is part of the diagram, and it might be related to other angles. 

Let me consider the angle at Y in triangle TWY, which is α = ∠TYW. This angle is at Y, between T, Y, W. 

This angle is also part of the larger diagram, and might be related to ∠XYT. 

Let me consider that ∠XYT and ∠TYW are adjacent, forming the angle at Y between X, Y, W, which is ∠XYW. 

So, ∠XYT + ∠TYW = ∠XYW. 

We have ∠XYT = 90° - 2x (from triangle TXY). 

∠TYW = α. 

And ∠XYW is part of triangle WXY, which has angles: 

- At X: ∠WXY = arc WY  
- At W: ∠XWY  
- At Y: ∠XYW  

As before, in triangle WXY, which is isoceles with XW = XY = r. 

Let me calculate arc WY. 

Total circle: arc TW + arc WY + arc YT = 360°. 

We have arc YT = 4x + 20° (from earlier), arc TW = 2α, and arc WY = ?. 

So, 2α + arc WY + (4x + 20°) = 360° → arc WY = 360° - 2α - 4x - 20° = 340° - 2α - 4x. 

Now, in triangle WXY, the angle at X is ∠WXY = arc WY = 340° - 2α - 4x. 

The other two angles are equal, as it's isoceles. Let's call them δ each. 

So, ∠WXY + 2δ = 180° → 340° - 2α - 4x + 2δ = 180° → 2δ = 180° - 340° + 2α + 4x = -160° + 2α + 4x → δ = (-160° + 2α + 4x)/2 = -80° + α + 2x. 

Now, δ is the base angle at W and Y in triangle WXY. 

Let's focus on δ at Y, which is ∠XYW = -80° + α + 2x. 

But from earlier, ∠XYW = ∠XYT + ∠TYW = (90° - 2x) + α. 

So:

-80° + α + 2x = 90° - 2x + α  
Simplify: 

Left side: -80 + α + 2x  
Right side: 90 - 2x + α  
Set equal: -80 + α + 2x = 90 - 2x + α  
Cancel α from both sides: -80 + 2x = 90 - 2x  
Bring terms together: 2x + 2x = 90 + 80 → 4x = 170 → x = 170/4 = 42.5°. 

This is still not among the options. 

But let's check if this makes sense. 

With x = 42.5°, let's compute arc TW = 2α, arc YT = 4x + 20 = 4*42.5 + 20 = 170 + 20 = 190°. 

Arc WY = 340 - 2α - 4x. 

But we need to find α. 

From the triangle TWY, we have α + β = 170 - 2x. 

But we also need to find β. 

Let me consider another relationship. 

In triangle TWY, we have angle at T: β. 

This angle is an inscribed angle subtending arc WY. 

So, β = ½ * arc WY. 

Thus, β = ½ * (340 - 2α - 4x). 

But from earlier, β = 170 - 2x - α. 

So:

170 - 2x - α = ½ * (340 - 2α - 4x)  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
340 - 4x - 2α = 340 - 2α - 4x  
Which simplifies to 340 - 4x - 2α = 340 - 4x - 2α → 0 = 0. 

This is an identity, so it doesn't provide new information. 

Thus, we need another equation to solve for x. 

But we already used all available information, leading to x = 42.5°, which is not an option. 

This suggests that there is still an error in the assumptions. 

Let me reconsider the relationship between ∠TWY and arc TY. 

∠TWY is at W, subtending arc TY. So, arc TY = 2 * ∠TWY = 2*(2x + 10°) =
