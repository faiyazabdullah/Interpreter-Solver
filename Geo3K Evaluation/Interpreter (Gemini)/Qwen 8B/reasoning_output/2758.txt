D. 7.5

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the height of trapezoid GHJK given some information. The problem says it's a trapezoid with bases GH and KJ. The lengths of these bases are 17 and 13 respectively. The area is 75 square meters. The question is asking for the height.

First, I remember that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is (base1 + base2)/2 multiplied by the height. So the formula is:

Area = ( (base1 + base2) / 2 ) * height

They've given me the area as 75, base1 (GH) is 17, base2 (KJ) is 13. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.

So substituting the values:

75 = ( (17 + 13) / 2 ) * height

Let me compute 17 + 13 first. That's 30. Then divide by 2, which gives 15. So the equation becomes:

75 = 15 * height

To find the height, I need to divide both sides by 15. 

Height = 75 / 15

Calculating that, 75 divided by 15 is 5. Wait, so the height should be 5? Let me check again.

Yes, because 15 times 5 is 75. So that seems right. But wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 5. So that would be the answer?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem mentions lines GK and HJ, but since it's a trapezoid with bases GH and KJ, the legs are GK and HJ. But the area formula only depends on the two bases and the height. The fact that they mentioned the lines GK and HJ might be just part of the diagram, but since they told us the bases are parallel, we don't need to worry about the legs for calculating the area.

Another thing to confirm: Are the given bases indeed the two parallel sides? Yes, the problem states that lines GH and KJ are parallel, and they're both considered bases. So the formula applies here.

Therefore, my calculation is correct. The height is 5, which corresponds to answer choice C. So I think the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The area of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula:  
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2}{2} \times \text{Height}
$$  
Given:  
- $\text{Base}_1 = 17$ (length of $GH$)  
- $\text{Base}_2 = 13$ (length of $KJ$)  
- $\text{Area} = 75$  

Substitute the known values into the formula:  
$$
75 = \frac{17 + 13}{2} \times h
$$  
$$
75 = \frac{30}{2} \times h
$$  
$$
75 = 15h
$$  
Solving for $h$:  
$$
h = \frac{75}{15} = 5
$$  

**Final Answer: C**
