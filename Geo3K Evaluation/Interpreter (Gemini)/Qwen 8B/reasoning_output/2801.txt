MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the measure of angle ACD in this parallelogram ABCD. 

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, opposite angles are congruent, and consecutive angles are supplementary. The diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. Wait, but here they mention specific points and lines, so maybe we need to use some triangle properties or something else.

Looking at the given information:

- AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. So ABCD is a parallelogram.
- The lengths of AD is 13 units, DC is 10 units. Wait, but since it's a parallelogram, AD should equal BC, and AB equals CD. But DC is given as 10, which would mean AB is also 10? Wait, no. Let me check again. 

Wait, the length of Line(A,D) is 13. Since AD is one side, and in a parallelogram opposite sides are equal. So BC should be equal to AD, meaning BC = 13. Then DC is 10, so AB should be equal to DC, so AB = 10. Hmm. But there are variables involved here. Let me look again. 

The LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is Sub(Mul(3,y),8). And LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is Add(Mul(2,x),7). But since AB and CD are congruent (because it's a parallelogram), and CD is equal to AB. Wait, CD is the same as AB? Wait, CD is the line from C to D, which is one of the sides. Wait, in a parallelogram, AB and CD are opposite sides, so their lengths should be equal. Similarly, AD and BC are opposite sides. 

But the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),10). So DC is 10. Therefore, AB must also be 10. So the expression for AB, which is Sub(Mul(3,y),8) equals 10. So 3y - 8 = 10 → 3y = 18 → y = 6. That might be useful later.

Similarly, the length of AD is 13. Since AD is congruent to BC, then BC is 13. The length of BC is given as Add(Mul(2,x),7). So 2x + 7 = 13 → 2x = 6 → x = 3. Okay, so we can find x and y here. Not sure yet if that helps directly, but maybe.

Now, looking at angles. There are several angles mentioned. For example, Angle(A,F,B) is 49 degrees, Angle(D,B,A) is 20 degrees, and Angle(A,D,B) is 59 degrees. These angles seem related to point F, which is the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so F is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

So, maybe we can use triangle properties here. Let's consider triangles formed by the diagonals. For instance, triangle ABD and triangle CBD. But perhaps focusing on triangle AFB or others. 

Given that angle at AFB is 49 degrees. Also, angle DBC is given as 20 degrees. Wait, angle(D,B,A) is 20 degrees. That's angle at B between D and A. Wait, angle at B, between points D, B, A. Which would be angle DBA. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but angle at B, which is angle ABC. Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally. 

Let me think about the angles. Let me note down the known angles:

- MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) = 49°. This is angle at point B between points A, F, B. Wait, no. Wait, angle notation: Angle(A,F,B) means the angle at point F between points A and B. Wait, no. Wait, angle(A,F,B) is the angle at point F between segments AF and BF. Wait, but F is the intersection of diagonals. So in a parallelogram, diagonals intersect at F, so AF is part of diagonal AC, and BF is part of diagonal BD. 

Therefore, angle AFB is 49 degrees. Also, angle DBC is 20 degrees. Wait, angle(D,B,A) is angle at B between D and A, so that's angle ABD. Wait, angle D,B,A is angle at B between D and A, which is angle ABD. Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So yes, angle at B between D and A, so angle ABD. Given as 20 degrees. 

Also, angle(A,D,B) is angle at D between A and B. So angle ADB. Which is given as 59 degrees. 

Hmm. Now, we need to find angle ACD. Let me visualize quadrilateral ABCD. Let me sketch it mentally. Points A, B, C, D forming a parallelogram. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. 

We need to find angle ACD. That's the angle at point C between points A, C, D. So angle ACD. Alternatively, in triangle ACD, angle at C. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle ADC. Wait, but since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is parallel to BC, and AB is parallel to DC. 

Another approach: Since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. So F is the midpoint of AC and BD. 

In triangle ABD, we have angle ABD = 20°, angle BAD... Wait, maybe not. Let me think. 

Alternatively, considering triangle AFB. We know angle at F is 49°, and maybe other angles?

Wait, angle AFB is 49°, and since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, but do they form certain angles? Maybe we can use triangle properties. 

But perhaps we can use the fact that in triangle ABD, angle at B is 20°, angle at D is 59°, and maybe angle at A? Wait, angle ADB is 59°, which is angle at D between A and B. Wait, angle ADB is part of triangle ABD. 

Wait, in triangle ABD, angles at A, B, D. If angle at B is 20°, angle at D is 59°, then angle at A (BAD) would be 180 - 20 - 59 = 101°. 

But wait, angle BAD is one of the angles of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle BAD is 101°, then angle ABC would be 180 - 101 = 79°, etc. However, I'm not sure if this is accurate because angle ADB isn't necessarily the same as angle at D in the parallelogram. Wait, angle ADB is part of triangle ABD. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD. 

In triangle ABD, sides: AB, BD, AD. 

We know AD is 13 units, AB is 10 units (from earlier calculation when solving for y). Wait, earlier, we had AB = 3y -8 = 10, so y=6. So AB is 10. AD is 13. 

If we can find BD, then we could apply the Law of Sines. But BD is a diagonal. But maybe we can relate it through angles. 

In triangle ABD, angles:

- At B: 20° (angle ABD)
- At D: 59° (angle ADB)
- At A: 180 - 20 - 59 = 101°, as above.

Then, applying Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle ADB) = AD / sin(angle ABD) = BD / sin(angle BAD)

So AB / sin(59°) = AD / sin(20°)

Plugging numbers:

AB = 10, AD = 13.

Check if 10/sin(59) ≈ 13/sin(20).

Calculate sin(59°): approx 0.8572

sin(20°): approx 0.3420

Left side: 10 / 0.8572 ≈ 11.66

Right side: 13 / 0.3420 ≈ 37.99

These are not equal. That suggests inconsistency. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe my assumption that angle ADB is 59 degrees is incorrect? Wait, the problem states:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) is 59 degrees. That's angle at D between A and B, so angle ADB. Yes. So that's angle ADB. 

But according to the Law of Sines, the ratio AB/sin(angle ADB) should equal AD/sin(angle ABD). But substituting gives different values. Therefore, either my understanding is wrong, or there's another factor.

Wait, maybe angle ABD is not 20 degrees? Let me check the original problem statement again.

Original constraints:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,A)),20). So angle at B between D and A, which is angle ABD. So angle ABD is 20 degrees. Correct.

And angle(A,D,B) is angle at D between A and B, which is angle ADB. Given as 59 degrees. 

So why does the Law of Sines give inconsistent results? Maybe my assumption that triangle ABD has those angles is wrong. Wait, perhaps angle at D is not angle ADB? Or maybe I confused the angles. Let me re-examine.

In triangle ABD, vertices are A, B, D. The angles are:

- At A: angle BAD
- At B: angle ABD
- At D: angle ADB

Yes. So if angle ABD is 20°, angle ADB is 59°, then angle BAD is 101°, as before. But according to Law of Sines, 10/sin(59) vs 13/sin(20) don't match. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Perhaps the given angles are not in triangle ABD? Wait, maybe angle ADB is not part of triangle ABD? No, angle ADB is at D, between A and B, so yes, it's part of triangle ABD. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not in the triangle, but elsewhere. Wait, but the problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) is 49°, which is angle at F between A and B. 

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,A)) is 20°, which is angle at B between D and A (angle ABD). 

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) is 59°, which is angle at D between A and B (angle ADB). 

So these three angles are in triangle ABD. But according to the Law of Sines, they should satisfy the ratios. However, they don't. Therefore, there's a problem here. 

Wait, maybe my calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate:

Compute 10 / sin(59°):

sin(59°) ≈ 0.8571673

So 10 / 0.8571673 ≈ 11.66

Compute 13 / sin(20°):

sin(20°) ≈ 0.3420201

So 13 / 0.3420201 ≈ 37.99

Which is way larger than 11.66. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. 

Wait, perhaps angle ADB is not 59 degrees? Or maybe angle ADB is not in triangle ABD? Wait, no. 

Wait, maybe the angles given are not the ones I thought. Let me check again:

Angle(A,D,B) is angle at D between A and B, which is angle ADB. So that's correct. 

Angle(D,B,A) is angle at B between D and A, which is angle ABD. Correct. 

So, if these two angles are in triangle ABD, then the third angle at A should be 101°, but then the Law of Sines would require AB/sin(angle ADB) = AD/sin(angle ABD). But 10/sin(59) ≈ 11.66, and 13/sin(20) ≈ 37.99. These are not equal. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in my reasoning. Perhaps the angles given are not all in triangle ABD? Or maybe I misapplied the Law of Sines?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me clarify:

In triangle ABD:

- Side opposite angle ABD (which is 20°) is AD = 13.

- Side opposite angle ADB (which is 59°) is AB = 10.

- Side opposite angle BAD (which is 101°) is BD.

Law of Sines says:

AD / sin(angle ABD) = AB / sin(angle ADB) = BD / sin(angle BAD)

So plugging in:

AD / sin(angle ABD) = 13 / sin(20°) ≈ 13 / 0.3420 ≈ 37.99

AB / sin(angle ADB) = 10 / sin(59°) ≈ 10 / 0.8572 ≈ 11.66

These are not equal, which violates the Law of Sines. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumptions.

Wait, but the problem gives us that ABCD is a parallelogram, so maybe the given angles are not in triangle ABD? How?

Wait, perhaps angle ADB is not part of triangle ABD. Wait, but ADB is part of triangle ABD. Unless... Wait, maybe the diagram is not convex? Or maybe the points are arranged differently? 

Alternatively, maybe angle ADB is not inside triangle ABD? But that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not referring to the same triangle. Wait, angle(A,F,B) is 49°, which is at point F. Maybe we need to consider other triangles. 

Let me think again. Since diagonals intersect at F, which divides them into halves. So AF = FC, BF = FD. 

Maybe consider triangle AFB. We know angle at F is 49°, and we might find other angles. 

But to do that, we need more info. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, the sum of angles around point F. 

Wait, in a parallelogram, diagonals divide it into four triangles. Each pair of vertical angles are equal. 

For example, angle AFB and angle CFD are vertical angles. Also, angle AFD and angle BFC are vertical angles. 

Additionally, since diagonals bisect each other, triangles AFB and CFD are congruent, as well as triangles AFD and BFC. 

But without knowing more angles or sides, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but we have some angles given. Let's see:

Angle AFB is 49°, angle ABD is 20°, angle ADB is 59°. 

Wait, maybe triangle ABD has angles 20°, 59°, and 101°, but the sides don't fit. So maybe the given angles are not in triangle ABD, but in another triangle? 

Wait, angle ADB is 59°, which is part of triangle ABD, but maybe there's another triangle involving angle ADB? 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle AFD or something else. 

Wait, since F is the intersection of diagonals, maybe we can use the fact that diagonals split the parallelogram into triangles with certain properties. 

Alternatively, since angle AFB is 49°, and diagonals intersecting, maybe using the property that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. But that might not help here. 

Alternatively, since we have angles involving point F, maybe using triangle AFB. Let's think about that. 

In triangle AFB, we know angle at F is 49°, and maybe other angles. But we need more information. 

Wait, angle ABD is 20°, which is angle between AB and BD. Since F is on BD, angle ABD is part of triangle ABD. 

Alternatively, since angle ABD is 20°, and angle AFB is 49°, perhaps considering triangle AFB and triangle BFD? 

Wait, maybe using the fact that in triangle ABD, angle ABD = 20°, angle ADB = 59°, so angle BAD = 101°, and then using that angle BAD is one of the angles of the parallelogram. 

Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle BAD + angle ABC = 180°. 

But angle BAD is 101°, so angle ABC is 79°. 

But how does this help us find angle ACD?

Wait, angle ACD is part of triangle ACD. Let me consider triangle ACD. 

Points A, C, D. We need angle at C, which is angle ACD. 

In parallelogram ABCD, AD is congruent to BC, and AB congruent to DC. Also, angle at A (BAD) is 101°, angle at D (ADC) is supplementary to angle BAD, so 79°, since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. Wait, no: in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle BAD and angle ADC are consecutive, hence supplementary. So angle ADC = 180° - angle BAD = 180 - 101 = 79°. 

But angle ADC is composed of angle ADB + angle CDB? Wait, no. Point B is connected to D, so angle ADC is at point D between A and C. Wait, in the parallelogram, angle ADC is at D between A and C. So angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, which is 79°, as per parallelogram properties. 

But how does this help with angle ACD? 

In triangle ADC, we have sides AD = 13, DC = 10, and AC is the diagonal. We need angle at C, which is angle ACD. 

Using Law of Cosines in triangle ADC:

AC² = AD² + DC² - 2 * AD * DC * cos(angle ADC)

But angle ADC is 79°, so:

AC² = 13² + 10² - 2*13*10*cos(79°)

But we don't know AC. Alternatively, maybe we can find AC using other methods. 

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram satisfy the formula:

AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²)

From the parallelogram law. 

But we don't know BD. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD. Earlier, there was inconsistency, but maybe we can resolve it. 

Wait, if angle BAD is 101°, then in triangle ABD, angle at A is 101°, angle at B is 20°, angle at D is 59°, and sides AB = 10, AD = 13. 

But according to the Law of Sines, AB / sin(angle ADB) = AD / sin(angle ABD). Plugging in:

AB / sin(59°) = 10 / 0.857 ≈ 11.66

AD / sin(20°) = 13 / 0.342 ≈ 37.99

These are unequal. Which implies inconsistency. Hence, there's a mistake in our assumptions. 

Wait, but the problem provides specific values, so there must be a way to reconcile this. Maybe the given angles are not all in triangle ABD? Let me think again. 

Wait, angle ADB is 59°, which is in triangle ABD. Angle ABD is 20°, also in triangle ABD. So where is the mistake? 

Ah! Wait, angle ADB is not in triangle ABD. Wait, no, it is. Unless the diagram is not drawn in the standard way. 

Wait, perhaps the angle ADB is not in triangle ABD? Let me double-check. 

Point A, D, B. So triangle ABD has vertices A, B, D. Angle at D is between A and B, which is angle ADB. So that's correct. 

So why the inconsistency? 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not in the same triangle? Or perhaps the given angles include some external angles? 

Alternatively, maybe the given angle measures are not all internal angles of the parallelogram? 

Wait, the problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) = 49°, which is angle at F between A and B. 

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,A)) = 20°, which is angle at B between D and A. 

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) = 59°, which is angle at D between A and B. 

So these three angles are in triangle ABD. 

But according to Law of Sines, they should satisfy AB/sin(angle ADB) = AD/sin(angle ABD). 

But in reality, these don't hold. This suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, but since this is a math problem, there must be a solution. Perhaps the given angles are not in triangle ABD but involve other parts. 

Wait, angle ADB is 59°, which is part of triangle ABD. But maybe angle ADB is actually an external angle? Or maybe the diagram is not a standard parallelogram? 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not in the triangle, but in other triangles. Let me think about triangle AFD. 

Wait, since F is the intersection of diagonals, in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So AF = FC, BF = FD. 

Let me consider triangle AFD and triangle BFC. They are congruent by SAS, since AF = FC, BF = FD, and angle AFB = angle CFD. 

But I still don't see how this connects to the given angles. 

Alternatively, focus on triangle AFB. We know angle at F is 49°, and we might find other angles. 

Let me assume that in triangle AFB, we can find other angles. To do this, we need more information about sides or other angles. 

But how? Maybe using the fact that in triangle ABD, we have angles 20°, 59°, and 101°, even though the Law of Sines doesn't hold. Maybe the given data includes some inconsistencies, but the problem expects us to ignore that and proceed with the given angles? 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not in triangle ABD, but in other triangles. 

Wait, angle ABD is 20°, which is part of triangle ABD. Angle ADB is 59°, also part of triangle ABD. So if we accept that, even though the Law of Sines doesn't hold, maybe we can proceed. 

Assuming angle BAD is 101°, then in the parallelogram, angle ABC is 180 - 101 = 79°. 

Now, angle ACD is the angle at C between A and D. Let's think about triangle ACD. 

In parallelogram ABCD, angle ADC is 79°, as established. So in triangle ADC, we have:

- AD = 13
- DC = 10
- Angle at D: angle ADC = 79°

So using Law of Cosines to find AC:

AC² = AD² + DC² - 2 * AD * DC * cos(angle ADC)

AC² = 13² + 10² - 2*13*10*cos(79°)

Let me compute this:

13² = 169, 10² = 100, so total is 269.

Now, 2*13*10 = 260

cos(79°) ≈ 0.1908

So 260 * 0.1908 ≈ 260 * 0.19 = 49.4, plus 260*0.0008 = 0.208, so approximately 49.608

Thus, AC² ≈ 269 - 49.608 ≈ 219.392

So AC ≈ sqrt(219.392) ≈ 14.81

Now, in triangle ACD, we can use Law of Sines to find angle ACD.

Law of Sines: AD / sin(angle ACD) = DC / sin(angle CAD) = AC / sin(angle ADC)

Wait, angle ADC is 79°, angle at D. 

Let me denote angle ACD as θ, which is what we need to find. 

Then, angle at A in triangle ADC is angle CAD. Let's call it φ. 

So in triangle ADC:

θ + φ + 79° = 180° => θ + φ = 101°

Also, from Law of Sines:

AD / sin(θ) = DC / sin(φ) => 13 / sin(theta) = 10 / sin(phi)

But phi = 101° - theta

So:

13 / sin(theta) = 10 / sin(101° - theta)

Let me write this equation:

13 / sin(theta) = 10 / sin(101° - theta)

Cross-multiplying:

13 * sin(101° - theta) = 10 * sin(theta)

This is an equation in theta. Let me try to solve it.

Let me expand sin(101° - theta) using sine subtraction formula:

sin(101° - theta) = sin(101°)cos(theta) - cos(101°)sin(theta)

So:

13[sin(101°)cos(theta) - cos(101°)sin(theta)] = 10 sin(theta)

Expand:

13 sin(101°) cos(theta) - 13 cos(101°) sin(theta) = 10 sin(theta)

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

13 sin(101°) cos(theta) - 13 cos(101°) sin(theta) - 10 sin(theta) = 0

Factor sin(theta):

13 sin(101°) cos(theta) - sin(theta)[13 cos(101°) + 10] = 0

Let me compute numerical values:

First, calculate sin(101°) and cos(101°). 

101° is in second quadrant. 

sin(101°) ≈ sin(180° - 79°) = sin(79°) ≈ 0.9816

cos(101°) ≈ -cos(79°) ≈ -0.1908

So:

13 * 0.9816 * cos(theta) - sin(theta)[13*(-0.1908) + 10] = 0

Calculate the term in brackets:

13*(-0.1908) = -2.4804; adding 10 gives 7.5196

So:

13 * 0.9816 * cos(theta) - 7.5196 sin(theta) = 0

Compute 13 * 0.9816 ≈ 12.7608

So:

12.7608 cos(theta) - 7.5196 sin(theta) = 0

Rearranged:

12.7608 cos(theta) = 7.5196 sin(theta)

Divide both sides by cos(theta):

12.7608 = 7.5196 tan(theta)

So tan(theta) = 12.7608 / 7.5196 ≈ 1.697

Now, tan(theta) ≈ 1.697. Find theta such that tan(theta) ≈ 1.697.

Calculating arctangent of 1.697:

tan(60°) = √3 ≈ 1.732, which is slightly higher than 1.697. Let's see:

Let me approximate. Let's say theta ≈ 59.8 degrees, since tan(59.8) is close to 1.697. 

Wait, let's check tan(59°): tan(59°) ≈ 1.664, tan(60°)=1.732. Our value is 1.697, which is between 59° and 60°. Let's calculate exact value:

Let me use calculator steps. Let me suppose theta ≈ 59.8 degrees. Let me check tan(59.8):

Let me convert 59.8 degrees to radians for better approximation? Or just estimate. 

Alternatively, using linear approximation between 59° and 60°:

At 59°, tan(59) ≈ 1.664

At 60°, tan(60) ≈ 1.732

Difference in tan: 1.732 - 1.664 = 0.068 over 1 degree.

Our target is 1.697, which is 1.697 - 1.664 = 0.033 above 59°.

So fraction: 0.033 / 0.068 ≈ 0.485. So approx 59° + 0.485° ≈ 59.485°, so approximately 59.5°. 

So theta ≈ 59.5 degrees. 

But wait, the answer choices are A. 20, B. 29, C. 49, D. 59. 

So closest choice is D. 59. But the calculated value is approximately 59.5°, which is very close to 59°. 

However, the question asks for m∠ACD, which we're finding as approximately 59.5°, which is closest to option D (59). 

But let me verify if there's another way to get this angle. 

Wait, but earlier, we assumed angle BAD is 101°, based on angles in triangle ABD. But that led to inconsistency in the Law of Sines. But assuming that, we arrived at angle ACD ≈ 59.5°, which matches option D. 

But the problem gave us angle ADB as 59°, which is very close to this value. Could there be a connection? 

Wait, angle ADB is 59°, and angle ACD is approximately 59.5°. It's possible that due to rounding errors in the calculations, they are similar. 

But why is angle ACD close to angle ADB? Is there a relationship between them?

In parallelogram ABCD, angle ADB is part of triangle ABD, while angle ACD is part of triangle ADC. Are these angles related? 

Let me think about the diagonals. In a parallelogram, the diagonals create vertical angles and alternate interior angles. 

Wait, angle ADB is at D, between A and B. In triangle ABD. Angle ACD is at C, between A and D. 

Is there a relationship between these angles? 

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is parallel to BC, and AB is parallel to DC. 

Consider transversal AC. Since AD || BC, and AC is a transversal, then angle ACD is equal to angle BCA (alternate interior angles)? Wait, let me visualize. 

Line AD is parallel to BC. Transversal AC intersects them at points D and C respectively. So angle between AD and AC at D (which is angle ADC) is equal to angle between BC and AC at C. Wait, angle ADC is at D between A and C. Wait, but angle ACD is at C between A and D. 

Wait, maybe using alternate interior angles. If AD || BC, and AC is a transversal, then angle between AD and AC at D is equal to angle between BC and AC at C. 

But angle ADC is at D between A and C. Wait, angle ADC is the angle at D between A and C, which is angle ADC. Whereas angle ACD is at C between A and D. 

Wait, angle ADC and angle ACD are two angles in triangle ADC. 

But in the parallelogram, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, which we previously calculated as 79°, but that may not be directly helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ADC, angle ACD is equal to angle ADB? 

But angle ADB is 59°, and we found angle ACD ≈ 59.5°, which is very close. This suggests that maybe angle ACD is equal to angle ADB, which is 59°, making the answer D. 

But why would they be equal? Let me think. 

Since AD is parallel to BC, and BD is a transversal. Angle ADB (at D) and angle CBD (at B) are alternate interior angles. Wait, angle ADB and angle CBD: are they alternate interior angles? 

Yes, because AD || BC, and BD is a transversal. So angle ADB and angle CBD are alternate interior angles, hence congruent. 

So angle ADB = angle CBD. 

Given that angle ADB is 59°, then angle CBD is also 59°. 

Now, angle CBD is part of triangle CBD. 

But how does this relate to angle ACD? 

Let me think about triangle BCD. In parallelogram ABCD, BC is congruent to AD, which is 13. DC is 10. 

Wait, angle CBD is 59°, which is at point B between C and D. 

But angle ACD is at point C between A and D. 

Is there a way to connect these? 

Alternatively, in triangle BCD, we can find some angles. 

But maybe using triangle BCD and triangle ACD. 

Wait, since ABCD is a parallelogram, BC is congruent to AD (both 13), DC congruent to AB (10). 

In triangle BCD, sides BC = 13, DC = 10, and BD is a diagonal. 

If we can find angles in triangle BCD, perhaps relating to angle ACD. 

But angle at B in triangle BCD is angle CBD = 59°, as established. 

So in triangle BCD, we have sides BC = 13, DC = 10, angle at B is 59°. 

Using Law of Sines:

DC / sin(angle at B) = BC / sin(angle at D) = BD / sin(angle at C)

Wait, angle at B is 59°, DC is 10, BC is 13.

So 10 / sin(59°) = 13 / sin(angle at D)

So sin(angle at D) = (13 * sin(59°)) / 10 ≈ (13 * 0.8572)/10 ≈ 11.1436/10 ≈ 1.11436

But sine cannot exceed 1, so this is impossible. Again, inconsistency. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the given data, but since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps there's a different approach. 

Wait, going back to the beginning, maybe the given angles are not in triangle ABD but involve other elements. 

The key given angles are:

- Angle(A,F,B) = 49° (at F between A and B)
- Angle(D,B,A) = 20° (at B between D and A)
- Angle(A,D,B) = 59° (at D between A and B)

These are three angles, possibly forming a triangle or part of it. 

Since F is the intersection of diagonals, let's consider triangle AFB. We know angle at F is 49°, and maybe other angles. 

Also, in triangle ABD, angle at B is 20°, angle at D is 59°, and angle at A is 101°, as before. 

Even though this leads to inconsistency in the Law of Sines, perhaps we should proceed with this assumption. 

If angle at A is 101°, then in parallelogram, angle at A is 101°, angle at B is 79°, angle at C is 101°, and angle at D is 79°. 

Now, to find angle ACD, which is part of angle at C. 

In parallelogram, angle at C is 101°, which is angle BCD. 

But angle ACD is part of angle BCD. Specifically, angle ACD is the angle at C between A and D. 

Wait, in parallelogram ABCD, angle at C is angle BCD, which is 101°. But angle ACD is part of this angle. 

Wait, angle BCD is at point C between B and D. While angle ACD is at point C between A and D. 

So angle ACD is part of angle BCD. 

To find angle ACD, we need to determine how much of angle BCD is taken by angle ACD. 

Let me think about triangle BCD. In parallelogram ABCD, BC is 13, DC is 10. 

Wait, if we can find angle BCD, which is 101°, and if we can find angle BCD in terms of other angles. 

But angle BCD is at point C between B and D. 

But angle ACD is at point C between A and D. 

So angle ACD is part of angle BCD. Let me visualize: at point C, the angle between B and D is angle BCD, and the angle between A and D is angle ACD. 

But since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector CB is parallel to AD. So, angle between CB and CD is angle BCD, and angle between AD and CD is angle ACD. 

Wait, since AD is parallel to BC, and CD is a side. So, angle between AD and CD is equal to angle between BC and CD, which is angle BCD. Wait, no. 

Wait, AD is parallel to BC. CD is a side. So, angle between AD and CD is equal to angle between BC and CD, because AD || BC. 

Wait, at point D, angle ADC is between AD and DC. At point C, angle BCD is between BC and DC. Since AD || BC, and DC is a transversal, angle ADC and angle BCD are consecutive interior angles, so they are supplementary. 

Wait, angle ADC + angle BCD = 180°. 

Earlier, we said angle ADC is 79°, so angle BCD = 180 - 79 = 101°, which matches the previous calculation. 

Now, angle ACD is part of angle BCD. Let me think about triangle ACD. 

In triangle ACD, we have angle at D is angle ADC = 79°, angle at C is angle ACD, and angle at A is angle CAD. 

Earlier, we tried to find angle ACD using Law of Sines and got approximately 59.5°, which is very close to 59°, one of the answer choices. 

But why is this angle ACD close to 59°, which is the given angle ADB? 

Because in the parallelogram, angle ADB is equal to angle CBD, as alternate interior angles (since AD || BC). 

And angle CBD is part of triangle BCD, where we have angle at B is 59°, and angle at C is 101°, leading to angle at D being 180 - 59 - 101 = 20°, which is angle CDB. 

Wait, in triangle BCD, angles are:

- At B: 59°
- At C: 101°
- At D: 20°

Wait, that adds up to 59 + 101 + 20 = 180°, which works. 

So angle CDB is 20°, which is angle at D in triangle BCD. 

But angle CDB is the same as angle ADB, since in parallelogram, diagonals create certain relationships. 

Wait, angle ADB is 59°, angle CDB is 20°? No, earlier calculation said angle CDB is 20°, but angle ADB is 59°. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me recheck. 

In triangle BCD, angle at B is angle CBD = 59°, angle at D is angle CDB, and angle at C is angle BCD = 101°. 

Sum: 59 + angle CDB + 101 = 180 → angle CDB = 20°. 

So angle CDB is 20°, which is the same as angle ABD, which was given as 20°. 

This makes sense because in parallelogram, angle ABD and angle CDB are alternate interior angles, hence equal. 

So, angle CDB = 20°, which is angle at D in triangle BCD. 

Now, returning to triangle ACD. We need to find angle ACD. 

In triangle ACD, we know angle at D is angle ADC = 79°, and angle at C is angle ACD, and angle at A is angle CAD. 

But we also know that in triangle ADC, angle CAD is equal to angle CBD, because of some relationship? 

Wait, let me think. Since AD || BC, and AC is a transversal. So, angle between AD and AC (angle CAD) is equal to angle between BC and AC (angle BCA). 

Wait, angle CAD is equal to angle BCA. 

So, angle CAD = angle BCA. 

Let me denote angle BCA as x. Then angle CAD = x. 

In triangle ABC, we can find angle BCA. 

Wait, in parallelogram ABCD, angle ABC is 79°, as calculated earlier. 

In triangle ABC, angles at A, B, C. 

Wait, but ABC is a parallelogram, so ABC is a triangle? No, ABC is a side. Wait, ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB is parallel to DC, and AD parallel to BC. 

In triangle ABC, points A, B, C. But in parallelogram, AB is one side, BC is another side. 

Wait, angle at B in triangle ABC is angle ABC, which is 79°, as determined earlier. 

Also, sides AB = 10, BC = 13. 

So in triangle ABC, we can use Law of Sines to find angles. 

Wait, but we need to find angle BCA (x), which is angle at C in triangle ABC. 

Law of Sines: AB / sin(angle BCA) = BC / sin(angle BAC) = AC / sin(angle ABC)

But we don't know AC. 

But maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC to find AC. 

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle ABC)

AB = 10, BC = 13, angle ABC = 79°

So AC² = 10² + 13² - 2*10*13*cos(79°)

Calculate this:

100 + 169 = 269

2*10*13 = 260

cos(79°) ≈ 0.1908

So 260 * 0.1908 ≈ 49.608

Thus, AC² ≈ 269 - 49.608 ≈ 219.392 → AC ≈ 14.81, as before.

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle ABC:

AB / sin(x) = BC / sin(angle BAC) = AC / sin(79°)

But we don't know angle BAC or x. 

But we know that angle BAC + angle BCA + angle ABC = 180°

So angle BAC + x + 79° = 180° → angle BAC = 101° - x

So, using Law of Sines:

AB / sin(x) = BC / sin(101° - x)

Which is the same equation as before, leading to x ≈ 59.5°, as previously calculated. 

Thus, angle BCA = x ≈ 59.5°, which is equal to angle CAD. 

Now, in triangle ACD, angle at A is angle CAD = x ≈ 59.5°, angle at D is 79°, so angle at C (ACD) is 180 - 79 - 59.5 = 41.5°. Wait, this contradicts earlier calculation. Wait, no, wait. 

Wait, in triangle ACD, angles are:

- at A: angle CAD = x ≈ 59.5°
- at D: angle ADC = 79°
- at C: angle ACD = ?

Wait, sum of angles: x + 79 + angle ACD = 180 → angle ACD = 180 - x - 79 = 101 - x.

Wait, if x is 59.5°, then angle ACD = 101 - 59.5 = 41.5°. 

But this conflicts with earlier calculation where using Law of Sines in triangle ADC gave angle ACD ≈ 59.5°. Where is the mistake?

Ah, I see. Previously, I made a mistake in setting up the equation. When I used Law of Sines in triangle ADC, I assumed angle at D was 79°, but actually, in triangle ADC, angle at D is not angle ADC. Wait, no, angle ADC is at D between A and C, which is indeed angle at D in triangle ADC. 

Wait, let me clarify:

In parallelogram ABCD, angle ADC is at D between A and C. So in triangle ADC, angle at D is angle ADC = 79°, angle at A is angle CAD = x, and angle at C is angle ACD = ? 

So, angle ACD = 180 - 79 - x. 

But earlier, when I solved the equation from Law of Sines, I found x ≈ 59.5°, which would make angle ACD = 180 - 79 - 59.5 = 41.5°. 

But this contradicts the earlier calculation where I thought angle ACD was 59.5°. Where is the error?

Wait, let me go back to the Law of Sines in triangle ADC. 

Previously, I set up the equation:

13 / sin(theta) = 10 / sin(phi), where theta is angle ACD, phi is angle CAD. 

And phi = 101° - theta, since in the parallelogram, angle BAD = 101°, and angle CAD is part of it. 

Wait, no, angle BAD is 101°, and angle BAD is composed of angle BAC + angle CAD. Wait, if angle BAC is x, then angle BAD = x + angle BAC? No, need to clarify. 

Actually, angle BAD is the angle at A between B and D. In parallelogram, this is angle BAD. 

But in triangle ABC, angle BAC is part of angle BAD. 

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me start fresh. 

We have in triangle ADC:

- AD = 13
- DC = 10
- angle ADC = 79°
- Need to find angle ACD

Using Law of Cosines to find AC:

AC² = AD² + DC² - 2*AD*DC*cos(angle ADC) = 13² + 10² - 2*13*10*cos(79°) ≈ 169 + 100 - 260*0.1908 ≈ 269 - 49.608 ≈ 219.392 → AC ≈ 14.81

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle ADC:

AD / sin(angle ACD) = DC / sin(angle CAD) = AC / sin(79°)

Let me write:

13 / sin(theta) = 10 / sin(phi) = 14.81 / sin(79°)

Where theta is angle ACD, phi is angle CAD. 

First, compute 14.81 / sin(79°):

sin(79°) ≈ 0.9816

14.81 / 0.9816 ≈ 15.09

So, 13 / sin(theta) = 15.09 → sin(theta) = 13 / 15.09 ≈ 0.861

Thus, theta ≈ arcsin(0.861) ≈ 59.3°

Ah! Here, angle ACD is approximately 59.3°, which is very close to 59°, matching option D. 

Earlier confusion came from mixing up angle CAD and angle BCA. 

So, the correct calculation shows angle ACD ≈ 59.3°, which is closest to option D, 59°. 

Thus, the answer is D.
