MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle EFGH. The points E, F, G, H are the vertices of the rectangle. There's a point K which is the intersection of the diagonals EG and FH. Given that FK is 32 feet, we need to find the length of EG.

First, I remember that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other. That means the point K, where the diagonals intersect, should be the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if EG and FH are diagonals, then K is the midpoint for both. Therefore, the lengths from E to K and K to G should be equal, same with F to K and K to H. 

The problem states that FK equals 32 feet. Since K is the midpoint of FH, that would mean that FK is half the length of FH. Wait, but FH is a diagonal of the rectangle, just like EG. And since diagonals in a rectangle are congruent, EG equals FH. So if FK is half of FH, then FK is half of EG as well? Wait, no. Let me think again.

If K is the midpoint of FH, then FK is half of FH. But since FH is congruent to EG (diagonals of a rectangle are congruent), then FH = EG. So FK is half of FH, so FK is half of EG. Therefore, EG would be twice FK. But wait, the problem says FK is 32. Then EG would be 64? But looking at the answer choices, option D is 64. However, let me check if there's more to it because sometimes problems can have tricks.

Wait, the problem also mentions that Line(FK) is part of the diagram. Wait, but in the problem statement, the line FG is one side, GH another, etc. Wait, maybe I need to consider coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps there's more information here. Let me re-examine the given constraints. It says:

- IntersectAt(Line(E,G), Line(F,H), Line(E,G), Point(K)) – meaning that lines EG and FH intersect at point K.

- IsDiagonalOf(Line(E,G), Rectangle(E,F,G,H)) – so EG is a diagonal.

- Similarly for FH being a diagonal.

So, since diagonals intersect at K, which is their midpoint. So, K is the midpoint of both diagonals. Hence, the length from E to K equals K to G, and similarly F to K equals K to H.

But the problem states that Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), 32). So FK is 32. Since K is the midpoint of FH, then FK is half of FH. Therefore, FH = 2*FK = 64. But since in a rectangle, diagonals are equal, so EG = FH = 64. Therefore, EG is 64. Which would make the answer D.

Wait, but why is there a mention of adding LengthOf(Line(F,K)) and LengthOf(Line(K,H))? Because the problem says:

Add(LengthOf(Line(F,K)),LengthOf(Line(K,H))) Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,H)), SumOf(...)). But since K is the midpoint of FH, then FK + KH = FH. But since K is the midpoint, FK = KH, so FK + KH = 2*FK = FH. Therefore, FH = 2*FK = 2*32=64. Therefore, FH is 64, hence EG is 64. So EG is 64. So answer D.

But wait, the answer choices include D as 64. So why is there confusion? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Another way: Suppose the rectangle has sides of length a and b. Then the diagonals would have length sqrt(a² + b²). But since the diagonals are split into two equal parts by K. So, if FK is half the diagonal. Wait, but FK is part of the diagonal FH. Wait, FH is a diagonal. So FH is from F to H. So if K is the midpoint of FH, then FK = KH = FH/2. So FH = 2*FK = 64. Hence EG = FH = 64. Therefore, EG is 64. So answer D.

But let me check the other conditions. For example, there's a RightAngle at Angle(E,H,G). That is, angle at H between E-H-G. Since EFGH is a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So that condition is redundant. Also, the fact that EG and FH are congruent, which is true for rectangles. So everything checks out.

Therefore, the answer should be D, 64. But let me check again if there's a trick here. For instance, could there be a case where EG isn't equal to FH? No, in a rectangle, diagonals are always congruent. So EG must equal FH, so EG = 2*FK = 64. Therefore, the answer is D.
