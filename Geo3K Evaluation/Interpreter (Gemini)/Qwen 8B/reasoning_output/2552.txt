QUESTION:
Which segments are parallel?

CHOICES:
A. A B and C D
B. A D and B C
C. A D and B E
D. A E and B C

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which segments are parallel based on the given information. So first, I need to visualize the diagram using the points and lines mentioned. Let me list out all the given elements:

Points: A, B, C, D, E.
Lines: AB, BC, DE, AE, AD, BE.
Angles at various points with specific measures. Also, there's a quadrilateral ABED and triangle BEC. Plus, point E lies on line DC. 

First, let me note down all the angles given because they might help determine relationships between lines. The angles listed are:

- Angle(D,A,E) = 80°
- Angle(A,D,E) = 60°
- Angle(D,E,A) = 40° (Wait, that seems like the same as angle at E for triangle DEA? Or maybe different notation?)
Wait, angle(D,A,E) would be the angle at point A between DA and EA. Similarly, angle(A,D,E) is the angle at D between AD and ED. And angle(D,E,A) is the angle at E between DE and AE. Wait, but angles can sometimes be tricky with notation. Let me clarify each angle:

For example, Angle(D,A,E) means vertex at A, with sides going to D and E. So it's ∠DAE. Similarly, Angle(A,D,E) is ∠ADE, and Angle(D,E,A) is ∠DEA. But wait, the measure of these three angles should add up to 180° since they form triangle ADE. Let me check:

Given ∠DAE = 80°, ∠ADE = 60°, ∠DEA = 40°. Adding them up: 80 + 60 + 40 = 180°. That checks out. So triangle ADE has angles 80°, 60°, 40°, so that's consistent.

Now looking at other angles:

Angle(A,B,E) = 30°, which is ∠ABE. Then Angle(E,B,C) = 40°, which is ∠EBC. Angle(B,E,C) = 80°, which is ∠BEC. Angle(E,C,B) = 60°, which is ∠ECB. Finally, Angle(A,B,C) = 70°, which is ∠ABC.

Also, there's a quadrilateral ABED. So points A, B, E, D connected in order. So AB, BE, ED, DA. Wait, but the lines given include AB, BC, DE, AE, AD, BE. So quadrilateral ABED is formed by AB, BE, ED, DA. So connecting those four points. Also, triangle BEC is formed by points B, E, C.

Additionally, point E lies on line DC. So E is somewhere on DC. So line DC passes through E.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E. Let's start with triangle BEC. Since ∠EBC is 40°, ∠BEC is 80°, ∠ECB is 60°. Wait, adding those angles: 40 + 80 + 60 = 180°, which makes sense. So triangle BEC has angles 40°, 80°, 60°.

Then, looking at point E lying on DC. So D-E-C are colinear, with E between D and C.

Now, considering quadrilateral ABED. Let me think about the structure here. So ABED is a quadrilateral. So AB connects to BE, then BE connects to ED, then ED connects back to DA, and DA connects back to AB. So points A-B-E-D-A.

But also, we have line AE, which connects A to E. And line AD connects A to D. So A is connected to both D and E. Also, line BE connects B to E.

So perhaps the key is to find some relationships between the lines based on the angles. For instance, if two lines are parallel, their corresponding angles or alternate interior angles would be equal.

Looking at the angles around point A. We know ∠DAE = 80°, and ∠BAE is part of another angle. Wait, angle ABE is 30°, which is ∠ABE. Also, ∠BAE is adjacent to ∠DAE? Maybe not directly. Let me think.

Since AB is connected to AE and AD. Wait, A is connected to D and E via lines AD and AE. So at point A, there are lines AB, AD, and AE. Therefore, the angles at A would involve these lines.

We have ∠DAE = 80°, which is between DA and EA. Also, angle between BA and EA would be ∠BAE. Let me see. If we consider triangle ABE, which includes points A, B, E. In that triangle, we know ∠ABE = 30°, and maybe other angles?

Wait, triangle ABE has vertices A, B, E. The angles in triangle ABE would be ∠ABE (at B), ∠BAE (at A), and ∠AEB (at E). But do we know any of these angles?

We know ∠ABE = 30°, but what about others? Well, if we can find other angles related to triangle ABE, that could help. However, without more info, maybe we need to look elsewhere.

Alternatively, since E lies on DC, and we have angles involving E. Let me think about line DC passing through E. So line DC is extended to pass through E. Therefore, points D, E, C are colinear with E between D and C.

So line DC is split into DE and EC. Now, considering triangles involving these lines.

Looking at triangle BEC, which we already considered. Also, triangle ADE. Perhaps there are similar triangles or something else.

Another approach: To find if two lines are parallel, we can check if corresponding angles are equal, or consecutive interior angles sum to 180°, etc.

Let me check possible pairs of lines given in the answer choices:

Options are:

A. AB and CD

B. AD and BC

C. AD and BE

D. AE and BC

Let me evaluate each possibility.

Starting with option B: AD and BC. Are these lines parallel?

To check if AD || BC, we need to see if certain angles are equal or supplementary.

Looking at angles around point A and point B.

AD is connected to A, and BC is connected to B. How can we relate these?

Alternatively, since E lies on DC, and we have lines involving E. Let me think about transversals.

If lines AD and BC are cut by a transversal, say AB or BE or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle ABC. Wait, we have angle ABC = 70°, which is ∠ABC. Also, angle at B in triangle BEC is ∠EBC = 40°, so ∠ABC is composed of ∠ABE + ∠EBC. Since ∠ABE is 30°, ∠EBC is 40°, so total ∠ABC = 30 + 40 = 70°, which matches the given measure of ∠ABC. That confirms consistency.

So, in triangle ABC, angle at B is 70°, angle at C? Let me see. Wait, triangle ABC isn't fully defined yet. Wait, we have point C connected to B and E and D. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at line BC. What angles are adjacent to BC?

At point B, angle between AB and BC is 70°, as ∠ABC = 70°. At point C, angles involving BC are ∠ECB = 60°, which is part of triangle BEC.

Now, if we want to check if AD is parallel to BC, we need to see if there's a transversal creating equal angles. For example, if line AB is a transversal cutting AD and BC, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider line AD and line BC. Suppose they are parallel. Then, the corresponding angles made by a transversal would be equal. For instance, if line AB is a transversal, then ∠BAD and ∠ABC would be corresponding angles. Wait, ∠BAD is part of the angles at A. Wait, ∠BAD would be the angle between BA and AD. Is that known?

At point A, we have angles involving lines AB, AD, AE. Specifically, ∠DAE = 80°, which is between DA and EA. Also, ∠BAE is another angle at A. Let me calculate ∠BAE.

In triangle ABE, angles are ∠ABE = 30°, ∠BAE, and ∠AEB. Let me denote ∠BAE as x and ∠AEB as y. Then x + y + 30 = 180 => x + y = 150°. Also, since line AE is connected to point E, which is on DC. So line AE meets DC at E. So maybe there are other angles involving AE and DC.

Alternatively, looking at triangle ADE again. We had angles at A (∠DAE=80°), at D (∠ADE=60°), and at E (∠DEA=40°). So in triangle ADE, angles sum to 180. 

Now, considering that line AE intersects DC at E. So line AE goes from A to E, and line DC passes through E. Thus, line AE is intersecting DC at E. So maybe considering vertical angles or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ADE, ∠DEA is 40°, which is the angle between DE and EA. Since E lies on DC, then ∠DEA is part of the straight line DC. Wait, no. Because DE is part of DC, since E is on DC. So line DE is part of DC. So ∠DEA is the angle between DE (which is along DC) and EA. Therefore, ∠DEA is 40°, which is the angle between DC and EA at point E.

Therefore, if we imagine line DC (with E on it), and line EA making an angle of 40° with DC. So the direction of EA relative to DC is 40°. 

Similarly, if we can find other angles that might indicate parallelism. For example, suppose AD is parallel to BC. Then, the angle between AD and AE would correspond to some angle involving BC. Alternatively, if AD || BC, then the angle between AD and AE would be equal to the angle between BC and some line. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, let me think about the angles at point E. At point E, we have several angles. For example, ∠DEA = 40°, and also ∠AEB. Wait, ∠AEB is part of triangle ABE. Earlier, we had in triangle ABE, angles ∠ABE = 30°, ∠BAE = ?, ∠AEB = ?. Also, since E is on DC, line EC is part of DC. So maybe considering triangle BEC and triangle DEA.

Wait, in triangle BEC, angles are ∠EBC = 40°, ∠BEC = 80°, ∠ECB = 60°. So if we can find relations between these angles and other parts.

Also, line AE intersects DC at E. So, considering the straight line DC, with E on it. So line AE forms a transversal with DC. Therefore, the angle between AE and DC at E is ∠DEA = 40°, as established earlier. If there is another line that forms the same angle with DC, then those lines would be parallel.

Alternatively, if BC is parallel to AE, then the angle between BC and DC would be equal to ∠DEA = 40°. Let's check that. 

At point C, line BC meets DC. The angle between BC and DC at point C is ∠ECB = 60°, according to the given data. Wait, ∠ECB is 60°, which is the angle between EC and CB. Since EC is part of DC, then ∠ECB is the angle between DC and CB at point C. Therefore, if BC were parallel to AE, then the angle between DC and AE (which is ∠DEA = 40°) should be equal to the angle between DC and BC (which is ∠ECB = 60°). But 40 ≠ 60, so that suggests BC is not parallel to AE. Hence, option D (AE and BC) is not parallel.

What about option B: AD and BC? Let me check if AD is parallel to BC.

To check if AD || BC, we can use the property that if a transversal crosses them, the corresponding angles are equal. For example, if we take line AB as a transversal crossing AD and BC. At point A, the angle between AB and AD is ∠BAD. At point B, the angle between AB and BC is ∠ABC = 70°. If AD || BC, then ∠BAD should equal ∠ABC = 70°, but we don't know ∠BAD yet.

Alternatively, let's compute ∠BAD. Since at point A, we have angles involving lines AB, AD, and AE. Specifically, ∠DAE = 80°, and ∠BAE is part of triangle ABE. Let me try to find ∠BAE.

In triangle ABE, angles are ∠ABE = 30°, ∠BAE, and ∠AEB. Let me call ∠BAE = x, ∠AEB = y. Then x + y + 30 = 180 → x + y = 150°. 

But how can we find x or y? Maybe by looking at other angles involving point E. 

At point E, we have multiple angles. For example, ∠DEA = 40°, which is the angle between DE (part of DC) and EA. Also, ∠AEB is part of triangle ABE, and ∠BEC = 80°, which is part of triangle BEC. 

Since E lies on DC, the angles around E should sum appropriately. Let me consider the angles at point E. 

The angles at E include:

- ∠DEA = 40° (between DE and EA)
- ∠AEB (between AE and EB)
- ∠BEC = 80° (between EB and EC)

These angles should add up to the total angle around point E. Assuming that lines EA, EB, and EC are arranged such that they form a straight line when combined with DE. Wait, since E is on DC, which is a straight line. So line DC passes through E, meaning that DE and EC are collinear. Therefore, the angles at E on line DC are ∠DEA (from DE to EA) and ∠AEB (from EA to EB), and ∠BEC (from EB to EC), and then from EC back to ED? Wait, maybe I need to consider the full angle around E.

Actually, since E is on DC, the straight line DC implies that angles on either side of DC at E should add up to 180°. So the angle between EA and DC (which is ∠DEA = 40°) plus the angle between EA and EB (which is ∠AEB) plus the angle between EB and EC (which is ∠BEC = 80°) should account for the angles around E. Wait, but I think I need to consider that line DC is straight, so the angles on one side of DC would be supplementary to those on the other side.

Alternatively, considering that line DC is straight, so the angles on one side of DC at point E are ∠DEA (40°) and ∠AEB and ∠BEC. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of angles around E on one side of DC equals 180°. 

Assuming that EA is above DC, and EB is somewhere else. This is getting complicated. Let me try to write equations.

From the angles at point E:

∠DEA = 40°, which is between DE and EA.

∠AEB is between EA and EB.

∠BEC = 80°, which is between EB and EC.

Since DE and EC are parts of DC, the total angle from DE to EC is 180°, so ∠DEA + ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 180° ?

Wait, if you go from DE to EA (angle 40°), then from EA to EB (angle AEB), then from EB to EC (angle 80°), and finally from EC back to ED would complete the circle. But since E is on DC, moving from DE to EC is along DC, which is a straight line, hence the sum of angles from DE to EC should be 180°. Therefore, ∠DEA + ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 180° ?

Wait, no. Because ∠DEA is between DE and EA, which is one side. Then from EA to EB is ∠AEB, and from EB to EC is ∠BEC. But DE to EC is a straight line, so the total rotation from DE to EC is 180°, so ∠DEA + ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 180°. 

Thus:

40° + ∠AEB + 80° = 180°  
=> ∠AEB = 180 - 40 - 80 = 60°. 

So ∠AEB = 60°. 

Now, returning to triangle ABE, where ∠ABE = 30°, ∠AEB = 60°, so ∠BAE = 180 - 30 - 60 = 90°. 

Ah! So ∠BAE = 90°. 

This is important. So at point A, the angle between BA and EA is 90 degrees. 

Earlier, we knew that ∠DAE = 80°, which is the angle between DA and EA. So, since ∠BAE is 90°, and ∠DAE is 80°, the remaining angle between BA and DA is ∠BAD = ∠BAE - ∠DAE = 90° - 80° = 10°. 

So ∠BAD = 10°. 

Now, if we consider AD and BC being parallel, then the corresponding angles created by a transversal would be equal. For example, if line AB is a transversal cutting AD and BC, then ∠BAD and ∠ABC should be equal if AD || BC. 

Here, ∠BAD is 10°, and ∠ABC is 70°, which are not equal. So this suggests that AD is not parallel to BC. Hence, option B is incorrect.

Next, checking option C: AD and BE. Are AD and BE parallel?

To check this, we can look for angles that would be equal if they are parallel. For instance, if a transversal cuts AD and BE, then corresponding angles should be equal.

Consider line AE as a transversal. Line AD is crossed by AE at A, forming ∠DAE = 80°. Line BE is crossed by AE at E, forming ∠AEB = 60°. These angles are not equal, so AD and BE may not be parallel.

Alternatively, consider line AB as a transversal. If AD and BE are parallel, then the angles formed by AB with AD and BE should be equal. 

At point A, line AB forms ∠BAD = 10° with AD. At point B, line AB forms ∠ABE = 30° with BE. These angles are not equal, so likely not parallel.

Option D: AE and BC. As discussed earlier, at point E, the angle between AE and DC is 40°, and at point C, the angle between BC and DC is 60°, which are not equal. So unless there's another relationship, they aren't parallel.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's check if AE is parallel to BC by seeing if alternate interior angles are equal.

Suppose we have line AE and line BC. If they are parallel, then a transversal crossing them would create equal alternate interior angles. For example, if line AB is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB would be equal to the angle between BC and AB. 

At point A, the angle between AE and AB is ∠BAE = 90°. At point B, the angle between BC and AB is ∠ABC = 70°, which is not equal to 90°, so not parallel.

Alternatively, consider line BE as a transversal. If AE || BC, then the angles formed by BE with AE and BC should be equal. 

At point E, the angle between AE and BE is ∠AEB = 60°. At point B, the angle between BE and BC is ∠EBC = 40°, which isn't equal to 60°, so not parallel.

Hmm. So none of these seem to fit. Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Wait, what about line AD and line BE? Let me think about angles involving them. 

We have ∠BAE = 90°, which is between BA and AE. Also, line BE connects B to E. If AD and BE are parallel, then the angle between AD and AE should be equal to the angle between BE and some line. 

Alternatively, considering triangle ADE and triangle BE...? Not sure.

Wait, another idea: since we have quadrilateral ABED, which is a quadrilateral. If AD is parallel to BE, then ABED would be a trapezoid. But is that necessarily true? Let's check the angles.

Alternatively, if AD || BE, then the consecutive angles would be supplementary. For example, at point A, the angle between AB and AD (∠BAD = 10°) and at point B, the angle between AB and BE (∠ABE = 30°). If AD || BE, then those angles would be supplementary? No, because they are on different sides of AB. Wait, if AD || BE, then the angles formed by AB would be same-side interior angles, which should sum to 180°. So ∠BAD + ∠ABE = 10° + 30° = 40°, which is not 180°, so not parallel.

Hmm. So none of the options seem to fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps.

Earlier, I concluded that ∠BAE = 90°, leading to ∠BAD = 10°. Let me verify that calculation again.

In triangle ABE, ∠ABE = 30°, ∠AEB = 60°, so ∠BAE = 180 - 30 - 60 = 90°. Yes, that's correct. 

Then, at point A, between BA and DA, which is ∠BAD = ∠BAE - ∠DAE = 90° - 80° = 10°, assuming that DA and AE are on opposite sides of BA. Is that accurate?

Wait, the angle between BA and DA is ∠BAD. Since ∠DAE is the angle between DA and EA, and ∠BAE is between BA and EA. So yes, if BA and EA are on opposite sides of DA, then ∠BAD = ∠BAE - ∠DAE. But depending on the configuration, it could be that ∠BAD is actually ∠BAE + ∠DAE, but that would only be if they are on the same side. 

Wait, this is critical. Depending on the arrangement of points, the angle ∠BAD could be different. Let me think carefully about the configuration.

Points A, B, D, E. Line AD connects A to D, line AE connects A to E. Line AB connects A to B. So at point A, we have three lines: AB, AD, and AE. The angles between them depend on their arrangement.

Assuming that points are arranged such that from point A, the order of the lines is AB, AD, AE. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. However, the given angles suggest that ∠DAE = 80°, which is between DA and EA. And ∠BAE = 90°, which is between BA and EA. So if we imagine standing at point A, facing towards E, then BA is at some direction, DA is at another direction. The angle between DA and EA is 80°, and the angle between BA and EA is 90°. So the angle between BA and DA would be |90° - 80°| = 10°, assuming they are on the same side of EA. Or it could be 90° + 80° = 170° if they are on opposite sides. But how can we know?

This is ambiguous. However, given that there's a quadrilateral ABED, which is a four-sided figure. So the order is A-B-E-D-A. Which implies that the edges are AB, BE, ED, DA. So the sequence of points around the quadrilateral is A connected to B, B connected to E, E connected to D, D connected to A. So this suggests that the points are arranged such that when you traverse ABED, you go from A to B to E to D to A. So this would imply that the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting, and the points are arranged in a particular order.

In such a case, the angle at point A between AB and AD would be determined by the shape of the quadrilateral. Given that, perhaps the angle ∠BAD is indeed 10°, as previously thought. However, without a diagram, it's challenging, but we'll proceed with that assumption.

So if ∠BAD = 10°, and if we're trying to see if AD is parallel to BC, then the angle between AD and AB is 10°, while the angle between BC and AB is ∠ABC = 70°, which are not supplementary or equal. Hence, AD is not parallel to BC.

Wait, but what if we consider another transversal? For instance, line BE. If AD || BC, then the angle between AD and BE should be equal to the angle between BC and BE. Let me see.

At point B, the angle between BE and BC is ∠EBC = 40°. At point A, the angle between BE and AD? Not sure. Alternatively, if there's a transversal that crosses AD and BC, but I don't see an immediate connection.

Wait, what about triangle ADE and triangle BCE? Let me see their angles. Triangle ADE has angles 80°, 60°, 40°. Triangle BEC has angles 40°, 80°, 60°. Wait, they have the same set of angles. So they are similar triangles? Yes, because all angles are equal. So triangle ADE ~ triangle BEC by AAA similarity.

Therefore, the ratio of sides would be proportional. So if the triangles are similar, then corresponding sides are proportional. But how does this help us with parallel lines?

If triangle ADE ~ triangle BEC, then corresponding sides are proportional. For example, AD corresponds to BE, DE corresponds to EC, and AE corresponds to BC. If that's the case, then if AD/BE = DE/EC = AE/BC, then the triangles are similar.

But how does this affect parallelism? If AD/BE = AE/BC, then maybe AD is parallel to BC? Wait, in similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional, but that doesn't directly imply parallelism unless we have certain conditions.

Alternatively, if two triangles are similar, then corresponding angles are equal. For instance, ∠DAE corresponds to ∠BEC. Since ∠DAE = 80°, ∠BEC = 80°, which matches. Similarly, ∠ADE (60°) corresponds to ∠BCE (60°), and ∠DEA (40°) corresponds to ∠EBC (40°). So this similarity holds.

Because of this similarity, the corresponding sides are proportional. So AD corresponds to BE, DE corresponds to EC, and AE corresponds to BC. So AD/BE = DE/EC = AE/BC.

If AD/BE = AE/BC, then by the converse of Thales' theorem, if two sides are proportional and the included angle is equal, then the lines are parallel. Wait, but this requires that the included angle is equal.

Wait, in triangle ADE and BEC, ∠DAE = ∠BEC = 80°, and ∠ADE = ∠BCE = 60°, and ∠DEA = ∠EBC = 40°. So the correspondence of the triangles is such that AD corresponds to BE, DE corresponds to EC, and AE corresponds to BC.

So if we assume that the triangles are similar, then AD/BE = DE/EC = AE/BC. Therefore, if AD/BE = AE/BC, then by the converse of the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), the lines AD and BC would be parallel, since they are corresponding sides of similar triangles. Wait, but this depends on the orientation.

Alternatively, if two triangles are similar with a certain correspondence, then the lines connecting corresponding vertices might not necessarily be parallel. However, if the ratio of sides is equal and the included angles are equal, then maybe...

Wait, let's think differently. If AD is parallel to BC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, the angle between AD and AB would be equal to the angle between BC and AB. But earlier, we found that ∠BAD = 10° and ∠ABC = 70°, which are not equal. So this contradicts the assumption that AD || BC.

However, the similarity of triangles ADE and BEC suggests that there's a proportional relationship. Let me calculate the ratios.

From the similarity of triangle ADE ~ triangle BEC:

AD / BE = DE / EC = AE / BC.

Let me denote:

AD / BE = AE / BC → cross-multiplying gives AD * BC = BE * AE.

But without actual lengths, it's hard to confirm numerically. However, if this proportion holds, then it might imply that AD and BC are parallel if the triangles are similar in a way that creates that proportion.

But how does this relate to parallelism? It might not directly. Unless the proportion leads to certain angle relationships.

Alternatively, since the triangles are similar, the corresponding angles are equal. For instance, ∠ADE = ∠BCE = 60°. So ∠ADE is the angle at D in triangle ADE, which is between AD and DE. And ∠BCE is the angle at C in triangle BEC, between BC and CE. Since DE is part of DC (as E lies on DC), and CE is part of DC, then ∠BCE = 60° is the angle between BC and DC. 

Earlier, we noted that ∠DEA = 40°, which is the angle between DE (part of DC) and EA. If AD is parallel to BC, then the angle between AD and DC should be equal to the angle between BC and DC. But ∠ADE = 60°, which is the angle between AD and DE (DC). And ∠BCE = 60°, which is the angle between BC and EC (also DC). So these angles are both 60°, implying that AD and BC make the same angle with DC. Therefore, AD and BC are parallel!

Wait, that seems promising. Let me explain:

Since ∠ADE = 60°, which is the angle between AD and DC (since DE is part of DC). Also, ∠BCE = 60°, which is the angle between BC and DC. So both AD and BC make a 60° angle with DC. Therefore, AD and BC are both inclined at 60° to DC, which means they are parallel to each other. 

Yes! This makes sense. Because if two lines make the same angle with a third line (in this case, DC), then they must be parallel. This is a consequence of the alternate interior angles or corresponding angles if they are on opposite sides. 

So, this suggests that AD is parallel to BC. Hence, option B: AD and BC are parallel.

But earlier, when I tried to check using ∠BAD = 10° and ∠ABC = 70°, I thought they weren't matching. But that was under the assumption that the angles at AB are different. However, this new reasoning using the angles with DC shows that AD and BC are parallel. Where did I go wrong before?

Ah, because I was considering angles with respect to AB, but the key is that both AD and BC make the same angle with DC, hence being parallel. So even though the angles with AB differ, their angles with DC are equal, which ensures parallelism.

So the correct answer would be option B: AD and BC.

Let me double-check this conclusion. Since ∠ADE = 60° (between AD and DC), and ∠BCE = 60° (between BC and DC), then AD and BC are both inclined at 60° to DC, hence parallel. This is because if two lines are both inclined at the same angle to a common line, they must be parallel. This is a standard result in geometry.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
