MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have circle M with several points on it: F, K, G, H, P, J, L, N. There are lines connecting these points. The key points here are that certain lines are chords of the circle because they're mentioned as being part of the circle's chords. Also, there are perpendicularity conditions between some lines and midpoints.

Given that FL = 24 and HJ = 48. Also, the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc PJ.

First, since FL is a chord of the circle and L is the midpoint of FG (as per IsMidpointOf(L, Line(F,G))), then FL is half of FG. Wait, but FL is given as 24. Since L is the midpoint of FG, then FL would equal LG, so FG is twice that, which would be 48. But wait, HJ is also given as 48. Maybe there's some relationship between these chords?

Also, HJ is a chord of the circle, and N is the midpoint of HJ. So HN = NJ. Given that HJ is 48, each half is 24. Which matches the fact that HN and NJ are both 24. That makes sense. And also, the length of HN equals NJ, which is stated as Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,N)),24) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(N,J)),24). So that checks out.

Now, looking at the arcs. The measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. Need to find measure of arc PJ. Hmm. Let me think about how arcs relate to angles or other arcs.

Since points H, P, J are on the circle, and HJ is a chord. Also, point P lies on the circle. Wait, but we know that line KP is a chord of the circle, and line KP intersects line HJ at point N. Also, line KP is perpendicular to HJ. Wait, Perpendicular(Line(K,P),Line(H,J)) is given. So line KP is perpendicular to line HJ. Since HJ is a chord of the circle, and KP is another chord perpendicular to it at point N. 

But since N is the midpoint of HJ, and since in a circle, if a diameter is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. However, here KP isn't necessarily a diameter unless it passes through the center. Wait, but maybe we can use some properties here. If two chords intersect at right angles, does that tell us anything? Or perhaps the arcs?

Alternatively, since HJ is a chord of length 48, and N is its midpoint. Then the distance from the center of the circle to the chord HJ can be calculated using the formula for the distance from the center to a chord: d = √[r² - (c/2)²], where c is the chord length. But do we know r? Not yet. But maybe we can relate it with other chords.

Wait, but FL is another chord. FL has length 24, and since L is the midpoint of FG, FG is 48. So FG is another chord of length 48, same as HJ. So maybe those chords are congruent? But their positions might differ.

But perhaps there's something else. Let's look at the arcs. Arc HP measures 65 degrees. Let me consider the inscribed angles or central angles related to these arcs.

Let me recall that the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle subtending it. Also, if two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. But here, maybe we can apply that.

Wait, line KP is perpendicular to HJ at point N. So the angle between KP and HJ is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle at point N between KP and HJ is 90 degrees. Since N is the intersection point of KP and HJ, and since N is the midpoint of HJ, which is a chord. Let me consider the angle formed by two chords intersecting at N. According to the intersecting chords theorem, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

So angle PNH (or whatever angle at N) is 90 degrees. Let me formalize this:

The angle between chords KP and HJ at point N is 90°, which equals ½ (arc PH + arc KJ)? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact intercepted arcs. When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

But here, the angle at N is between chords HJ and KP. So the angle is formed by chords HJ and KP. So the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. Specifically, the angle intercepts arcs PH and... hmm. Wait, when two chords intersect at N, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at E, then angle AEC is ½(arc AC + arc BD).

Applying this to our case: angle at N between HJ and KP. Let me denote the intersection point as N. So HJ is one chord, and KP is another chord. So angle at N is formed by HJ and KP. Therefore, the angle is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles formed. 

Which arcs? The angle at N intercepts arcs PH and JK? Or maybe arcs PK and HJ? Wait, need to think carefully. 

If you have two chords intersecting at N: one chord is HJ, going from H to J; the other chord is KP, going from K to P. The angle at N between HJ and KP would intercept arcs that are opposite to the angle. For instance, the angle at N intercepts arcs HP and KJ. Because when you draw the two chords, the angle is formed by parts of the chords. 

Therefore, according to the intersecting chords theorem:

measure of angle at N = ½(measure of arc HP + measure of arc KJ)

But we know that angle at N is 90 degrees, so:

90° = ½(arc HP + arc KJ)

Multiply both sides by 2:

arc HP + arc KJ = 180°

We are told that arc HP is 65°, so substituting:

65° + arc KJ = 180°

Thus, arc KJ = 180° - 65° = 115°

But wait, what is arc KJ? Well, K and J are points on the circle. However, we need to relate this to the arc PJ that we need to find. Let me see. 

But maybe there's more relationships. Also, note that line KP is a chord of the circle, passing through N, which is the midpoint of HJ. Also, line KL is perpendicular to FG, and L is the midpoint of FG. 

Wait, perhaps we can find other arcs. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle or other relationships. 

Alternatively, since HJ is a chord of length 48, and N is the midpoint. Also, since HJ is 48, and N divides it into two segments of 24 each. Similarly, FL is 24, and L is the midpoint of FG, making FG = 48. So FG is another chord of length 48. 

Moreover, lines FG and KL are perpendicular. Let me check the constraints again. 

Perpendicular(Line(K,L),Line(F,G)): yes, line KL is perpendicular to line FG. 

So line KL is perpendicular to FG. Since FG is a chord of the circle, and line KL is another chord (since K and L are on the circle, as per PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(M)) and PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(M))? Wait, no. Wait, the points on the circle are F, K, G, H, P, J, L, N. Wait, but L is defined as the intersection of lines FG and KL. Wait, the IntersectAt(Line(F,G),Line(K,L),Line(F,G),Point(L)). So that means that line KL intersects line FG at point L. So point L is on both FG and KL. Also, since L is the midpoint of FG, as per IsMidpointOf(L, Line(F,G)). Therefore, line KL is perpendicular to FG at its midpoint L. 

This suggests that line KL is the perpendicular bisector of FG. In a circle, the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center. Therefore, point M, the center of the circle, lies on line KL. 

Similarly, earlier we had that line KP is perpendicular to HJ at point N, which is the midpoint of HJ. Therefore, line KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ, implying that point M lies on line KP as well. 

Wait, if both KL and KP are perpendicular bisectors of chords FG and HJ respectively, then their intersection point should be the center of the circle. Therefore, point M is the intersection of KL and KP. 

So, point M is the intersection of KL and KP. Therefore, M lies on both KL and KP. Thus, lines KL and KP meet at M, which is the center. 

That seems important. Now, knowing that M is the center, we can use properties of circles involving centers and chords. 

For example, since KL is the perpendicular bisector of FG, then KM is perpendicular to FG. Similarly, since KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ, then KM is perpendicular to HJ? No, KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ, so PM is perpendicular to HJ. Wait, no. Wait, line KP is perpendicular to HJ at N, so since N is the midpoint of HJ, then the line KP passes through the center M. Therefore, PM is along KP, which is perpendicular to HJ. 

So, if we can find coordinates or relations between arcs, maybe we can find the measure of arc PJ. 

Let me try to think about the arcs. We already found that arc KJ is 115°, from before. But how does that help? 

Alternatively, maybe considering the position of points. Let me try to imagine the circle with center M. Points H and J are endpoints of a chord HJ of length 48. The midpoint N splits it into two 24-unit segments. Similarly, FG is a chord of length 48, split by L into two 24-unit segments. 

Additionally, line KP is perpendicular to HJ at N, meaning that KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ, hence passes through the center M. Similarly, line KL is the perpendicular bisector of FG, passing through M. Therefore, points K, L, M, and P are arranged such that KL and KP pass through M. 

So, points K and P lie on the circle, and line KP passes through the center M. Therefore, KP is a diameter? Wait, only if K and P are endpoints of a diameter. But since KP is a chord passing through the center, then yes, KP is a diameter. Therefore, the length of KP is twice the radius. 

But wait, we don't know the radius yet. However, since KP is a diameter, then the arc from K to P would be 180 degrees. But we were given that arc HP is 65 degrees. So maybe we can find arc PK, then subtract arc HP to get arc PJ?

Wait, let me clarify. If KP is a diameter, then points K and P are diametrically opposite. Therefore, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. But we have arc HP as 65 degrees. So depending on where H is located relative to K and P, we can figure out other arcs. 

But how does H relate to K and P? Let me think. Since HJ is a chord, and N is the midpoint, and KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ. Therefore, HJ is perpendicular to KP at N. Since KP is a diameter, then HJ is perpendicular to a diameter. 

In that case, the arc from H to J can be determined. Wait, but HJ is a chord of length 48. Let me calculate the radius first. 

Since HJ is a chord of length 48, and N is its midpoint, the distance from the center M to chord HJ is MN. Since N is the midpoint of HJ, and HJ is perpendicular to KP (which contains the center M). Therefore, the distance from M to HJ is the length of MN. 

But since KP is a diameter, and N is on KP, then MN is the distance from center to chord HJ. Using the formula for chord length: 

chord length = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from center to chord. 

Here, chord length HJ = 48 = 2√(r² - d²), so √(r² - d²) = 24 => r² - d² = 24² = 576.

Similarly, for chord FG of length 48, since L is its midpoint and line KL is the perpendicular bisector (so ML is the distance from center to FG). Therefore, same equation applies: same chord length, so same relation r² - e² = 576, where e is the distance from center to FG. 

But without knowing the distances d or e, maybe we can relate them via other information. However, perhaps we can find the radius using another chord. 

Wait, we also know that arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me think about how to relate that. 

Arc HP corresponds to the central angle ∠HMP. The measure of arc HP is equal to the central angle ∠HMP, which is 65 degrees. 

If we can find the relationship between points H, P, and others, maybe we can find other arcs. 

Since KP is a diameter, then P is directly opposite K. So, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. Therefore, if we can express arc HP in terms of other arcs. 

Suppose we consider the entire circle. Let me try to find the measure of arc PJ. 

From earlier, we had that arc KJ = 115 degrees. How did we get that? From the angle at N being 90 degrees, which was equal to half (arc HP + arc KJ). So 90 = ½(65 + arc KJ) → arc KJ = 115 degrees. 

But arc KJ is the arc from K to J. Let me think about how that relates to other arcs. 

Since KP is a diameter, then moving from K to P is 180 degrees. So, arc KP is 180 degrees. If we can express arc KJ as part of that. 

But arc KJ could be broken down into arc KP plus arc PJ? No, depends on the position. Suppose that J is somewhere on the circle such that moving from K to J goes through P or not. 

Alternatively, since arc KJ is 115 degrees, and arc KP is 180 degrees, then the arc from J to P would be arc JP = arc KP - arc KJ = 180 - 115 = 65 degrees? Wait, that would imply arc JP is 65 degrees. But that contradicts with the given arc HP is 65. Unless there's overlap. 

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to sketch mentally. 

Assume that point K is on the circle, and since KP is a diameter, P is the point opposite K. So, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. Now, point J is another point on the circle. The arc from K to J is 115 degrees, as calculated earlier. Therefore, if we move from K to J along the shorter arc, it's 115 degrees. Then, the arc from J to P would be 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. But that would mean arc JP is 65 degrees, but we are asked to find arc PJ, which is the same as arc JP. Wait, but the question says "m∠PJ", which is the measure of arc PJ. 

But wait, the given arc HP is 65 degrees. If arc JP is also 65 degrees, then why is the answer not 65? But that would make option B. But that seems too straightforward. However, maybe there's a mistake here. 

Wait, let me verify. Earlier, we said that angle at N (between HJ and KP) is 90 degrees, leading to arc HP + arc KJ = 180. Hence, arc KJ = 115. Then, if arc KJ is 115, and arc KP is 180, then arc JP would be arc KP minus arc KJ? Only if J is between K and P along the arc. But depending on the direction, arc KJ could be the major arc or minor arc. 

Wait, but arc KJ is 115 degrees, which is less than 180, so it's the minor arc. So, assuming that J is on the same side of KP as H. Wait, but H is connected to J. Since line KP is perpendicular to HJ at N, then H and J are on opposite sides of KP. 

Wait, maybe I need to think of the circle with diameter KP. Then, HJ is perpendicular to KP at N. So, H and J are on opposite sides of KP. 

Let me try to imagine the circle with diameter KP. Then, HJ is a chord perpendicular to KP at N, which is the midpoint of HJ. So, H and J are symmetric with respect to KP. 

Therefore, the arc from H to J would be the arc that goes around the circle. But since HJ is perpendicular to KP, which is a diameter, then the arc from H to J would consist of two arcs: one that goes above KP and one below. But since HJ is perpendicular to KP, the arc from H to J would be... 

Alternatively, since HJ is perpendicular to KP at N, which is the midpoint of HJ, and N is a point on KP. Since KP is a diameter, N lies somewhere along KP. 

But since HJ is 48 units long, and N is the midpoint, and the length from N to H or J is 24. 

But how does that relate to the arcs? 

Alternatively, since HJ is perpendicular to KP at N, and N is the midpoint of HJ, then the distance from N to the center M can be calculated. 

Let me attempt to compute the radius. 

Let me assume that the center M lies on KP. Let me denote the length from N to M as x. Since KP is a diameter, the total length from K to P is 2r. 

But N is a point on KP. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points will help. 

Let me place the circle with center at origin (0,0). Let me set up coordinate system such that KP is horizontal. Let me suppose that KP is the x-axis, with K at (-a, 0) and P at (a, 0), so that the center M is at (0,0). Then, the length of KP is 2a, so the radius is a. 

Then, line HJ is perpendicular to KP at point N. Since KP is the x-axis, then HJ is a vertical line. Since N is the midpoint of HJ, which is on KP (the x-axis). So, let me denote N as (n, 0). Then, HJ is a vertical line passing through N, so H and J have coordinates (n, b) and (n, -b), since N is the midpoint. The length of HJ is 2b = 48, so b = 24. 

So, points H(n, 24) and J(n, -24). 

But H and J are on the circle centered at (0,0) with radius a. Therefore, plugging into the circle equation:

For point H(n, 24): n² + (24)^2 = a² --> n² + 576 = a².

Similarly, for point J(n, -24): same equation.

Now, we also know that arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me find the coordinates of P, which is (a, 0). 

Point H is (n, 24). The arc from H to P is 65 degrees. The central angle between H and P is 65 degrees. 

The central angle between H and P can be found using the dot product or vector analysis. 

Vector OH (from center O to H) is (n, 24). Vector OP is (a, 0). The angle between these vectors is 65 degrees. 

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (OH · OP) / (|OH| |OP|)

OH · OP = n*a + 24*0 = na

|OH| = sqrt(n² + 24²) = sqrt(a²) = a (since n² + 576 = a²)

|OP| = sqrt(a² + 0) = a

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (na)/ (a * a) ) = n/a 

So cos(theta) = n/a 

But theta is 65 degrees. Therefore:

n/a = cos(65°)

Thus, n = a*cos(65°)

But we also have from earlier that n² + 576 = a². Substituting n = a cosθ:

(a² cos²θ) + 576 = a² 

=> a² (1 - cos²θ) = 576 

=> a² sin²θ = 576 

=> a = 576 / sinθ 

Since θ is 65 degrees, so:

a = 576 / sin(65°)

Calculate sin(65°):

sin(65°) ≈ 0.9063

So a ≈ 576 / 0.9063 ≈ 635.7

But maybe we don't need the actual value. Instead, we can relate other quantities. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc PJ. Let's find the central angle between P and J. 

Point J is (n, -24). Point P is (a, 0). Let's find the angle between vectors OP and OJ. 

Vector OJ is (n, -24). Vector OP is (a, 0). 

Again, using the dot product:

cos(phi) = (OJ · OP) / (|OJ| |OP|)

OJ · OP = n*a + (-24)*0 = na

|OJ| = sqrt(n² + (-24)^2) = sqrt(n² + 576) = a

|OP| = a

Therefore, cos(phi) = na / (a * a) = n/a, same as before. 

But phi is the angle between OJ and OP. However, since point J is (n, -24), and point P is (a, 0), the angle phi is measured from OP to OJ. 

But what is this angle? It depends on the position of J. Since J is (n, -24), and n = a cos(65°). 

Let me consider the angle between OP (along positive x-axis) and OJ. 

The coordinates of J are (n, -24) = (a cos65°, -24). 

So, the angle phi is the angle whose cosine is n/a = cos65°, but since the y-coordinate is negative, the angle is below the x-axis. 

Therefore, phi is equal to 360° - 65° = 295°, or equivalently, -65°. But since we're talking about the smaller arc, we take the smallest angle between P and J. 

However, since J is located at (n, -24), which is below the x-axis, while P is at (a, 0). Depending on the value of n, which is a cos65°, the angle could be different. 

But since n = a cos65°, and since cos65° is positive (because 65° is acute), n is positive. Therefore, point J is located to the right of the y-axis (since n is positive) and below the x-axis. 

So, the angle between OP (positive x-axis) and OJ is clockwise by 65°, but since angles in circles are typically measured counterclockwise, the central angle would be 360° - 65° = 295°, but since we want the smaller arc, it's actually 65°, but that conflicts with the previous thought. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between OP and OJ is the angle swept from OP to OJ. Since J is below the x-axis, the angle would be measured clockwise from OP to OJ, which is equivalent to a counterclockwise angle of 360° - 65° = 295°, but the smaller arc between P and J is the minimum of 65° and 295°, which is 65°. Wait, but that would suggest that the arc PJ is 65°, which is the same as arc HP. But that seems conflicting with the given data. 

Wait, but earlier we had arc KJ = 115°, which came from the angle at N. Let me check that again. 

Earlier, we used the intersecting chords theorem, saying that angle at N (which is 90°) equals half the sum of arcs HP and KJ. 

If arc HP is 65°, then arc KJ is 115°, so arc KJ = 115°. But in this coordinate setup, what is arc KJ? 

Point K is (-a, 0), point J is (n, -24). What's the arc from K to J? 

Let me compute the central angle between K and J. 

Vector OK is (-a, 0), vector OJ is (n, -24). 

Dot product: (-a)(n) + 0*(-24) = -an 

|OK| = a, |OJ| = a 

So cos(theta) = (-an)/(a^2) = -n/a 

Earlier, n/a = cos(65°), so this becomes -cos(65°). 

Therefore, the angle between OK and OJ is arccos(-cos65°) = 180° - 65° = 115°, which confirms that arc KJ is 115°, matching our previous calculation. 

So that works. Now, returning to finding arc PJ. 

We need the central angle between P and J. As discussed earlier, it's 65°, but let me confirm. 

If the central angle between P and J is 65°, then arc PJ is 65°, which would be answer B. But let me check again. 

Wait, point J is at (n, -24), point P is at (a, 0). The central angle between them is the angle between vectors OP and OJ, which we found earlier as having cosine equal to n/a = cos65°, but since OJ is pointing downward, the angle is measured clockwise from OP to OJ, which would correspond to an angle of -65°, or equivalently, 360° - 65° = 295°, but the smaller arc would be 65°, since the larger arc is 295°. 

But wait, the arc measure is always the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. So, arc PJ is 65°, which would make the answer B. But the given arc HP is also 65°, which seems like it's the same arc. However, arc HP and arc PJ may be different arcs depending on the positioning. 

Wait, but in this setup, arc HP is the arc from H to P, which we've already considered as 65°, and arc PJ is from P to J, which we just found as 65°. So that would mean both arcs are 65°, which seems possible. 

But let me cross-verify with other information. 

We also know that line KP is a diameter, so arc KP is 180°. Arc KJ is 115°, as established. Then, arc from K to J is 115°, and arc from K to P is 180°, so the arc from J to P would be 180° - 115° = 65°, confirming that arc JP is 65°, which would be the measure we're looking for. 

But then why is the answer not B? However, the problem asks for m∠PJ, which is the measure of arc PJ. But wait, is there any chance that the arc PJ is actually the reflex arc (greater than 180°)? But usually, unless specified, arc measures refer to the minor arc. 

But let me double-check. If arc KJ is 115°, and arc KP is 180°, then moving from J to P along the arc that doesn't go through K would be 180° - 115° = 65°, which is the minor arc. So arc PJ is indeed 65°, which would be answer B. 

But wait, the given arc HP is 65°, which is different from arc PJ. But in our setup, arc HP is from H to P, which is 65°, and arc PJ is from P to J, which is also 65°. This seems plausible. 

But wait, let me think again. Could there be a mistake in assuming that arc PJ is 65°? For example, maybe the arc is actually the major arc? 

No, because the central angle between P and J is 65°, so the minor arc is 65°, and the major arc would be 360° - 65° = 295°, but since the problem refers to arc PJ without specifying, it's likely referring to the minor arc. 

But then why is the answer not B? However, the given answer choices include B as 65, which would seem to fit. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, but earlier, we derived that the measure of angle at N is 90°, which gave us arc HP + arc KJ = 180°, leading to arc KJ = 115°, and then using that to find arc PJ = 65°. However, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. 

Another approach: Since HJ is a chord of length 48, and N is the midpoint. The length from N to the center M can be calculated. 

We can use the formula relating chord length, distance from center, and radius. 

As earlier, for chord HJ of length 48, with midpoint N. The distance from center M to chord HJ is d. Then:

chord length = 2√(r² - d²) ⇒ 48 = 2√(r² - d²) ⇒ √(r² - d²) = 24 ⇒ r² - d² = 576.

Similarly, for chord FG of length 48, same equation applies. 

But since line KP is the perpendicular bisector of HJ, and line KL is the perpendicular bisector of FG, both passing through the center M. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since arc HP is 65°, then the central angle ∠HMP is 65°. Then, triangle HMP is an isosceles triangle with HM = MP = r, and base HP. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle HMP:

HP² = HM² + MP² - 2*HM*MP*cos(angle HMP)

Which gives:

HP² = 2r² - 2r² cos(65°)

But HP is the length of the chord from H to P. Wait, but we don't know HP. However, we might relate it to other lengths. 

Alternatively, since we have coordinates from earlier, where point H is (n, 24) and P is (a, 0), then the distance between H and P is sqrt[(a - n)^2 + (0 - 24)^2]. 

But we also know that this is a chord of the circle, so HP is a chord. But we don't have its length. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the radius. From earlier, we had that a = 576 / sin(65°). 

But regardless of the exact value, the central angle between P and J is 65°, leading to arc PJ being 65°, which would make answer B. 

However, the answer choices include B as 65, so this suggests that the correct answer is B. 

But wait, let me check once more. The problem states that m∠HP is 65°, and asks for m∠PJ. If arc HP is 65°, and arc PJ is also 65°, then the answer is B. But I need to ensure that there are no other factors. 

Wait, but maybe there's an error in assuming that the central angle between P and J is the same as arc HP. Let me re-examine the coordinate setup. 

In the coordinate system, point H is (n, 24), point P is (a, 0). The central angle between H and P is 65°, so arc HP is 65°. Point J is (n, -24). The central angle between P and J is calculated as follows: 

Looking at the coordinates of P(a, 0) and J(n, -24), the angle between OP and OJ is computed as follows: 

The vector OP is (a, 0), and OJ is (n, -24). 

The angle between them can be found using tan(theta) = (y-component)/(x-component). 

But for vector OJ, the slope is -24/n. However, since n = a cos(65°), then tan(theta) = -24/(a cos65°). But since the angle is measured from OP (x-axis) to OJ, which is downward. 

Alternatively, using the earlier dot product, we saw that the angle between OP and OJ is arccos(n/a) = 65°, but since it's in the fourth quadrant, the angle is -65°, so the magnitude is 65°, hence the arc is 65°. 

Yes, that confirms it. Therefore, arc PJ is 65°, so answer B. 

But wait, the answer choices include B as 65, which would be correct. However, sometimes problems might expect the major arc, but the question didn't specify. However, since arc HP is given as 65°, which is presumably the minor arc, the same logic applies to arc PJ. 

But let me think again about the initial assumption that angle at N leads to arc HP + arc KJ = 180°. If that's correct, then arc KJ = 115°, and since arc KP is 180°, arc JP = 180° - arc KJ = 65°, which is consistent. 

So, multiple approaches lead to arc PJ being 65°, suggesting answer B. 

But why is option C 85, and option A 37.5? Perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me think again. Maybe my assumption that arc KJ = 115° is incorrect. Let me revisit the intersecting chords theorem. 

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, the angle at N is between chords HJ and KP. So the angle at N is formed by the intersection of chords HJ and KP. 

The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. Specifically, the angle at N intercepts arcs PH and KJ. 

Wait, but why? Let me recall: when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are those arcs that are opposite the angle. 

Imagine two chords AB and CD intersecting at E. Then, angle AEC is ½(arc AC + arc BD). 

In our case, the two chords are HJ and KP intersecting at N. So the angle at N is formed by HJ and KP. The intercepted arcs would be arc HK and arc PJ? Or arc HP and arc KJ? 

Wait, let me label the arcs properly. 

The angle at N is formed by chords HJ and KP. So the intercepted arcs are those that are not overlapping. 

Let me think of the angle at N. One side of the angle is HJ, and the other is KP. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. 

When two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. 

For example, if we have chords HJ and KP intersecting at N, then the intercepted arcs are arc HK and arc PJ? Or arc HP and arc KJ? 

Actually, it depends on how the chords are arranged. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. Chords HJ and KP intersect at N. So, starting from H, going to J, and from K to P. The angle at N is between HJ and KP. 

The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, one arc is between H and P, and the other arc is between K and J. 

Yes, that makes sense. Because when you have two intersecting chords, the angle is formed by one pair of arcs. So the angle is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two pairs of vertical angles. 

So, angle at N is ½(arc HP + arc KJ). 

Thus, 90° = ½(arc HP + arc KJ) → arc HP + arc KJ = 180°. 

Since arc HP is given as 65°, arc KJ is 115°. 

Now, arc KJ is 115°, and arc KP is 180°, so arc KJ + arc JP = arc KP? No, arc KJ and arc JP are adjacent? 

If we consider the circle, starting from K, going through J to P. If arc KJ is 115°, and arc KP is 180°, then arc JP would be arc KP - arc KJ = 180° - 115° = 65°, which is the same as arc HP. 

So, arc PJ is 65°, which matches our earlier conclusion. 

But then, why is there an option C (85)? Did I miss something? 

Wait, maybe the arc we're supposed to find is the major arc PJ instead of the minor arc? Let me check. 

If arc KJ is 115°, and arc KP is 180°, then arc from J to P could be either 65° or 295°, depending on the direction. 

But since the arc HP is 65°, which is likely the minor arc, then arc PJ should also be the minor arc of 65°. 

But maybe there's an error in assuming that arc KJ is 115°. Let me think again. 

If arc KJ is 115°, then from point K to J is 115°, and since KP is a diameter (180°), then from J to P is 180° - 115° = 65°, which is the measure of arc JP. 

Thus, the measure of arc PJ is 65°, which would be answer B. 

But the given answer choices include B as 65, which seems correct. 

However, I'm wondering if there's a possibility that the arc is not the minor arc. For example, if the angle at N is 90°, which is formed by the intersection of HJ and KP, maybe the intercepted arcs are different. 

Wait, another way to think: if angle at N is 90°, which is formed by chords HJ and KP, then the intercepted arcs could be arc HK and arc JP. 

Wait, no, the intercepted arcs depend on the order of the points. 

Maybe I made a mistake in identifying which arcs are intercepted. Let me look up the exact theorem. 

According to the intersecting chords angle theorem, the measure of the angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs are those arcs that are intercepted by the two pairs of vertical angles formed by the intersecting chords. 

So, if chords HJ and KP intersect at N, then the angle at N intercepts arcs that are opposite. 

Specifically, one arc is between H and P, and the other is between K and J. 

Because when you have chords HJ and KP intersecting at N, the angle at N is between HJ and KP, so the intercepted arcs are arc HP and arc KJ. 

Therefore, the previous calculation holds: angle at N = ½(arc HP + arc KJ) = 90°, so arc HP + arc KJ = 180°, leading to arc KJ = 115°, and thus arc PJ = 65°. 

Therefore, the answer should be B. 

But I need to check if there's any alternative interpretation. For example, maybe the arc PJ is not the direct arc from P to J but includes other points. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a reflection or symmetry I haven't considered. 

But given all the steps and consistency across methods, I think the answer is B. 

However, the given answer choices also include C (85), which might suggest that there's a different approach. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I misapplied the intersecting chords theorem. Let me verify with an example. 

Suppose two chords intersect at N, forming an angle of 90°. The measure of that angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Let me say that arc HP is 65°, and arc KJ is 115°, adding to 180°, which gives 90°. That seems correct. 

But if the question is asking for arc PJ, which is not directly related to arc KJ. 

Wait, but arc KJ is 115°, and arc KP is 180°, so arc JP is 180° - 115° = 65°, which is the same as arc HP. 

Thus, arc PJ is 65°, answer B. 

I think this is solid. Unless there's a trick I missed. 

Wait, but the problem mentions that HJ is a chord of the circle, and N is the midpoint of HJ. Also, we have that HN = 24, NJ = 24. 

And earlier, we had from the coordinate system that the distance from N to the center M is d = |MN|. 

From earlier, in the coordinate system, N is at (n, 0), and M is at (0,0). So distance from N to M is |n| = a cos65°. 

But we also know from the chord length formula that for chord HJ, which has length 48, the distance from center to chord is d = a cos65°, and the relation r² - d² = 24². 

Since r = a, and d = a cos65°, then:

a² - (a² cos²65°) = 24² 

a² (1 - cos²65°) = 24² 

a² sin²65° = 24² 

a = 24 / sin65° 

Which confirms the earlier calculation. 

Now, the distance from N to M is d = a cos65° = (24 / sin65°) * cos65° = 24 cot65° 

But cot65° is 1/tan65° ≈ 1/2.1445 ≈ 0.4663. So d ≈ 24 * 0.4663 ≈ 11.19. 

But how does this help? 

Perhaps not much, but it shows that the calculations are consistent. 

Thus, after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is B, 65 degrees. 

But let me check the answer choices again:

A. 37.5  
B. 65  
C. 85  
D. 130  

So, B is 65. 

But why is there an option C (85)? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the intercepted arcs. 

Alternative scenario: Maybe the angle at N is not formed by the arcs HP and KJ, but by other arcs. 

Let me think: when two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the ones that are opposite the angle. 

So, if the angle is at N, formed by chords HJ and KP, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. 

Chords HJ and KP intersect at N. So, the angle at N is formed by HJ and KP. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. 

One arc is between H and P, and the other arc is between K and J. 

Wait, but if you follow the intersecting chords, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords, not overlapping. 

Alternatively, the angle is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two chords. 

Wait, another source says: "The measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs." 

So, in this case, angle at N is formed by chords HJ and KP, so it intercepts arcs that are opposite. 

If you imagine the two chords crossing, the angle at N intercepts the arcs that are opposite to it. 

So, one arc is between H and P, and the other arc is between K and J. 

Thus, the calculation remains the same. 

Therefore, arc HP + arc KJ = 180°, leading to arc KJ = 115°, and then arc PJ = 65°. 

Thus, answer B. 

I think I've verified this thoroughly, so I'll conclude with B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{PJ} $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem and applying known theorems regarding intersecting chords in a circle.

---

### **Key Geometric Facts**

1. **Points on the Circle**:  
   Points $ F, K, G, H, P, J, L, N $ all lie on the circle centered at $ M $. Several of these are midpoints of chords, and several lines are perpendicular chords or diameters.

2. **Important Chords**:
   - Line $ FG $ has midpoint $ L $, and thus $ FL = GL = 24 $, giving $ FG = 48 $.
   - Line $ HJ $ has midpoint $ N $, and thus $ HN = NJ = 24 $, giving $ HJ = 48 $.
   - Lines $ KL $ and $ KP $ are perpendicular to $ FG $ and $ HJ $, respectively, and both pass through the center $ M $, indicating that $ KL $ and $ KP $ are perpendicular bisectors of the chords $ FG $ and $ HJ $.

3. **Angle at Intersection**:
   - At point $ N $, where chords $ HJ $ and $ KP $ intersect, the angle formed is $ 90^\circ $.
   - According to the **Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem**, the angle between two intersecting chords is equal to half the **sum** of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

---

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

#### **Step 1: Use the Intersecting Chords Theorem**
At point $ N $, the angle between chords $ HJ $ and $ KP $ is $ 90^\circ $. By the theorem:

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle N = \frac{1}{2}(\text{arc } HP + \text{arc } KJ)
$$

Substitute the known value:

$$
90^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(65^\circ + \text{arc } KJ)
$$

Solving:

$$
65^\circ + \text{arc } KJ = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \text{arc } KJ = 115^\circ
$$

#### **Step 2: Analyze Arc Relationships**
From Step 1, we now know that arc $ KJ = 115^\circ $.

Recall that line $ KP $ is a **diameter** because it is a perpendicular bisector of chord $ HJ $, and therefore passes through the center $ M $. Hence, the arc $ KP $ spans $ 180^\circ $.

Now observe that arc $ KJ $ and arc $ PJ $ together form arc $ KP $:

$$
\text{arc } KJ + \text{arc } PJ = \text{arc } KP = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
115^\circ + \text{arc } PJ = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \text{arc } PJ = 65^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of arc $ \widehat{PJ} $ is:

$$
\boxed{65}
$$
