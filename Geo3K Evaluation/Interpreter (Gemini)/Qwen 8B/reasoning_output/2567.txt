MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a rectangle EFGH. Let me recall that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel. 

The question says that the measure of angle HGE is 13 degrees. Wait, angle HGE... Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me label the rectangle properly. Let me think: points E, F, G, H. Since it's a rectangle, the order matters. Usually, rectangles are labeled in order such that consecutive letters are connected by sides. So E connected to F, F to G, G to H, H back to E. So the vertices are arranged in order E-F-G-H-E. 

So, angle HGE would be at point G, between points H, G, and E. Wait, angle HGE means vertex at G, with segments HG and GE. So in the rectangle, point G is connected to H and to F (since it's a rectangle). Wait, but the rectangle has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So side FG connects F to G, GH connects G to H, HE connects H to E, and EF connects E to F. 

Wait, so angle HGE is at point G, formed by points H, G, E. So that's the angle between HG and GE. But in the rectangle, HG is one side (from G to H) and GE is another segment? Wait, GE isn't necessarily a side of the rectangle. Because in the rectangle, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So GE would be a diagonal? Because connecting G to E would cross through the interior of the rectangle. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, there's also mention of lines EG and FH intersecting at point K. The problem states that line EG and line FH intersect at point K. Also, angle FGH is a right angle, which makes sense because it's a rectangle. Then they mention angle HGE measures 13 degrees, and the sum of angle HGE and angle FGE is 90 degrees. Wait, no: the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(H,G,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,E)),90). So angle HGE plus angle FGE equals 90 degrees. And they want us to find the measure of angle FGE, given that angle HGE is 13 degrees.

Let me rephrase the problem. In rectangle EFGH, angle HGE is 13 degrees. Find angle FGE. 

But wait, since it's a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. However, the problem mentions lines EG and FH intersecting at K. So EG is a diagonal from E to G, and FH is a diagonal from F to H. In a rectangle, these diagonals should bisect each other, so their intersection point K would be the midpoint of both diagonals. But how does that relate to the angles?

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider triangle HGE or triangle FGE. Let me try to sketch mentally. Points E, F, G, H forming a rectangle. Diagonals EG and FH intersect at K. Now, angle HGE is at point G, between H, G, E. That's part of triangle HGE. Similarly, angle FGE is at point G, between F, G, E. So angle FGE is adjacent to angle HGE? Or maybe supplementary?

Wait, since EFGH is a rectangle, then sides FG and GH are perpendicular. At point G, the sides FG and GH meet at a right angle. But angle HGE is inside the rectangle, involving the diagonal EG. Let me think about the angles around point G.

In the rectangle, at point G, we have two sides: FG going up to F, and GH going left to H. The diagonal from G to E would split the angle at G into two parts. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals split the angles into two equal parts? No, wait, only in a square. In a general rectangle, the diagonals are congruent but don't necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a square.

But here, angle HGE is given as 13 degrees. Let me think: angle HGE is the angle between HG and GE. Since HG is one side of the rectangle (from G to H), and GE is the diagonal from G to E. So angle between HG (which is horizontal?) and GE (diagonal). Similarly, angle FGE is the angle between FG (vertical) and GE (diagonal). Therefore, those two angles (HGE and FGE) are adjacent, forming the angle between FG and HG, which is a right angle. Wait, because at point G, the original angle of the rectangle is 90 degrees. So angle HGE + angle FGE = 90 degrees. Because the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle at G into two angles. Therefore, if angle HGE is 13 degrees, then angle FGE would be 90 - 13 = 77 degrees. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. But why did they give all the other information about the lines intersecting? Maybe to confirm that EG and FH are diagonals, hence creating those angles. But according to this reasoning, the answer would be 77 degrees, which is option D. 

Wait, but let me verify again. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. 

Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides FG and GH are perpendicular. So the angle between FG and GH is 90 degrees. When you draw the diagonal from G to E, it divides that 90-degree angle into two angles: angle FGE and angle HGE. Therefore, angle FGE + angle HGE = 90 degrees. Given that angle HGE is 13 degrees, angle FGE is 90 - 13 = 77 degrees. Hence, the answer should be D. 

But wait, maybe there's something else. For example, could the diagonal create some triangles where other properties apply? Like, perhaps using trigonometry? Suppose we consider triangle FGE. But in that case, if we know one angle and the fact that it's a rectangle, maybe we can use some relations. But I think my initial reasoning holds. 

Another way: coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place point G at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose FG is vertical and GH is horizontal. Let me define coordinates:

- Let’s say point G is at (0, 0).

- Since it's a rectangle, moving along GH (horizontal) to H. Let me assume GH is along the x-axis. So point H is at (a, 0) for some a > 0.

- FG is vertical from G(0,0) upwards to F(0, b) for some b > 0.

- Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, point E would be at (a, b), completing the rectangle.

Now, the diagonal EG connects E(a,b) to G(0,0). The slope of EG would be (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a. The angle HGE is the angle between HG (which is along the x-axis from G(0,0) to H(a,0)) and GE (the diagonal from G(0,0) to E(a,b)). 

So angle HGE is the angle between the positive x-axis (HG direction) and the diagonal GE. The tangent of angle HGE would be the slope of GE, which is rise over run, which is b/a. Therefore, tan(angle HGE) = b/a. 

Similarly, angle FGE is the angle between FG (which is vertical, from G(0,0) to F(0,b)) and GE. This angle is measured from the vertical FG towards the diagonal GE. The tangent of angle FGE would be the reciprocal of the slope, since it's the angle between the vertical line and the diagonal. Alternatively, since the total angle between FG (vertical) and HG (horizontal) is 90 degrees, and angle HGE is the angle between HG (x-axis) and GE, while angle FGE is the angle between FG (y-axis) and GE. Thus, angle HGE + angle FGE = 90 degrees. 

Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, angle HGE + angle FGE = 90 degrees. Therefore, if angle HGE is 13 degrees, angle FGE is 90 - 13 = 77 degrees. So the answer should be D. 

But let me check with actual numbers. Suppose angle HGE is 13 degrees, so tan(13°) = b/a. Then angle FGE is 77 degrees, so tan(77°) would be the slope of the line from GE relative to the vertical. Wait, actually, the angle between the vertical FG and GE would have tan(theta) = a/b. Because if you imagine a right triangle where the adjacent side is b (along FG) and the opposite side is a (along GH). Wait, no. Let me think again. 

If we consider angle FGE, which is at point G, between FG (vertical) and GE (diagonal). To find tan(angle FGE), we can imagine a right triangle where the base is along FG and the height is along GH. Wait, maybe I need to calculate it more carefully. 

From point G(0,0), the line GE goes to E(a,b). The vector GE is (a, b). The angle between FG (which is straight up along y-axis) and GE can be found using the dot product. The direction of FG is (0,1) (upwards), and direction of GE is (a,b). The angle between them is theta, which is angle FGE. 

Dot product of vectors FG and GE: (0,1) • (a,b) = 0*a + 1*b = b. The magnitude of FG is sqrt(0² + 1²) = 1. The magnitude of GE is sqrt(a² + b²). So cos(theta) = b / sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)).

Alternatively, sin(theta) would be a / sqrt(a² + b²), since the sine of the angle between FG and GE would correspond to the opposite side over hypotenuse. Wait, if theta is the angle between FG (vertical) and GE, then the triangle formed by FG, GH, and GE would have legs a and b, but I think this might be getting too complicated. However, earlier conclusion that angle HGE + angle FGE = 90 degrees still holds because they are complementary angles at point G. 

Because angle HGE is between HG (horizontal) and GE, and angle FGE is between FG (vertical) and GE. Together, they add up to the right angle between FG and HG. Therefore, their sum is 90 degrees. Hence, angle FGE = 90 - 13 = 77 degrees. 

Thus, the correct answer is D. 77 degrees. 

I think that's solid. All steps check out. The key was recognizing that the two angles at point G (formed by the diagonal) add up to the right angle of the rectangle. So even though the problem mentioned intersections of diagonals and other details, the core relationship is the complementarity of those two angles. Therefore, the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle FGE $ in rectangle $EFGH$, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure and relationships within the rectangle.

### **Understanding the Geometry**

Given that quadrilateral $EFGH$ is a **rectangle**, the following properties hold:

- All internal angles are **right angles** (i.e., $90^\circ$).
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- The diagonals ($EG$ and $FH$) bisect each other and are congruent.

We're told:
- $m\angle HGE = 13^\circ$
- We are asked to find $m\angle FGE$

Note that both $\angle HGE$ and $\angle FGE$ share a common vertex at point $G$, and together they form the **angle between the sides $FG$ and $GH$** of the rectangle. These sides are perpendicular, forming a right angle at point $G$. Hence,

$$
\angle HGE + \angle FGE = 90^\circ
$$

This equation directly relates the two angles without needing additional computations.

### **Step-by-Step Calculation**

Substitute the known value:

$$
\angle FGE = 90^\circ - \angle HGE = 90^\circ - 13^\circ = 77^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the geometric relationships in the rectangle and the given angle measures, the measure of $ \angle FGE $ is:

$$
\boxed{77}
$$
