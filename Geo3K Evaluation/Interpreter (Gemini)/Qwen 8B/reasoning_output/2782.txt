====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, it says that triangle ABC is a right triangle, specifically Right(Triangle(A,B,C)). Also, they mention that Angle(A,C,B) is a right angle. Wait, angle at point C? Because Angle(A,C,B) would be the angle at point C between points A, C, B. So that means the right angle is at point C. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at C. 

So, in a right-angled triangle, the sides opposite the angles are related by trigonometric ratios. Since it's right-angled at C, then sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. But wait, the problem also mentions IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)). That means line AB is the hypotenuse. So AB is the hypotenuse, which makes sense because the right angle is at C. So the hypotenuse is AB, so the other two sides are AC (which is length x) and BC (length given as 14√3). 

Wait, the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Mul(14,SqrtOf(3))). So BC is 14√3. Then, they say MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 30 degrees. Let me note that angle at B is 30 degrees. Wait, angle ABC is 30 degrees. Since the triangle is right-angled at C, the angles at A and B must add up to 90 degrees. If angle at B is 30, then angle at A is 60 degrees. 

But maybe I should use trigonometry here. Let me think. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angle at B is 30 degrees. The side opposite angle B is AC, which has length x. The side adjacent to angle B is BC, which is 14√3. The hypotenuse AB is y. 

Wait, but tan(angle B) equals opposite over adjacent. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. Which is x divided by 14√3. 

So tan(30°) is equal to 1/√3. Therefore:

tan(30°) = x / (14√3)

So solving for x:

x = 14√3 * tan(30°)

But tan(30°) is 1/√3. So substituting:

x = 14√3 * (1/√3) = 14. 

Wait, so x would be 14? But looking at the answer choices, option A is 14. But let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the sides mixed up. Let me confirm. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angle at B is 30 degrees. So angle B is 30 degrees, angle C is 90, angle A is 60. 

The side opposite angle B is AC, which is x. The side adjacent to angle B is BC, which is 14√3. So yes, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC = x / (14√3). 

Since tan(30°)=1/√3, so:

x/(14√3) = 1/√3 → Multiply both sides by 14√3:

x = 14√3*(1/√3) = 14. 

Yes, so x=14. Therefore, the answer would be A. However, let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe using sine or cosine?

For example, sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse. So sin(30°) = AC / AB. But we don't know AB yet. Or cos(angle B) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. 

But since we need x, which is AC, and BC is known. Let me see. If angle B is 30°, then BC is adjacent, AC is opposite. So tan(30) = AC / BC. As before. So same conclusion. 

Therefore, x=14. So answer A. But let me check the answer choices again. Option A is 14. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C)). Wait, Line(A,C) is AC, and Line(B,C) is BC. So those lines are perpendicular. Which is consistent with the right angle at C. So that checks out. 

Also, they mentioned IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B), ...). So AB is hypotenuse. So hypotenuse is AB, so AB is the longest side. Given BC is 14√3, which is approximately 24.25, and if x is 14, then AB can be calculated via Pythagoras. 

Let me compute AB. AB² = AC² + BC² = 14² + (14√3)^2 = 196 + 14^2 * 3 = 196 + 196*3 = 196*(1+3)=196*4=784. So AB= sqrt(784)=28. So AB is 28. 

But in that case, angle at B is 30°, so the ratio of sides would be 1 : √3 : 2. For a 30-60-90 triangle. Here, BC (adjacent to 30°) is 14√3, AC (opposite) is 14, and hypotenuse AB is 28. So that fits. Because in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are 1, √3, 2. So here, BC corresponds to √3 times some factor, and AC is 1 times the same factor. 

So the factor here is 14, since AC is 14. Then BC is 14√3, which matches. Hypotenuse is 28. So everything checks out. 

Thus, x is 14. So answer A. 

But just to make sure, the question asks for x, which is the length of line AC, which is 14. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying appropriate trigonometric relationships.

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

We are told:

- Triangle $ ABC $ is **right-angled** at point $ C $, i.e., $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $, meaning the angle at vertex $ B $ is $ 30^\circ $
- Side $ BC $ (opposite to angle $ A $) has length $ 14\sqrt{3} $
- We are asked to find the length of side $ AC $, denoted as $ x $

This forms a classic **30-60-90 triangle**, where the angles are $ 30^\circ $, $ 60^\circ $, and $ 90^\circ $. These triangles follow specific side-length ratios:

$$
\text{Opposite } 30^\circ : \text{Opposite } 60^\circ : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

In our triangle:
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $, so the side **opposite** this angle is $ AC = x $
- The side **adjacent** to $ 30^\circ $ is $ BC = 14\sqrt{3} $
- The hypotenuse is $ AB $

---

### **Step 2: Applying Trigonometric Ratios**

Using the definition of tangent for angle $ B $:

$$
\tan(\angle ABC) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{x}{BC}
$$

Given $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $ and $ BC = 14\sqrt{3} $, substitute into the equation:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{x}{14\sqrt{3}}
$$

Recall that:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{x}{14\sqrt{3}}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ 14\sqrt{3} $:

$$
x = 14\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 14
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying through trigonometric identities and confirming consistency with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we conclude that:

$$
x = 14
$$

### Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{A}
