MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC with points A, B, and C. There are several lines connecting them: AB, BC, and AC. The angles mentioned are angle at C (angle ACB) and angle at B (angle ABC). It says that angle ACB is a right angle. Also, the triangle is right-angled, which probably refers to that right angle at C. 

Then there are some length equalities. The length of line AC is 10 units, AB is 20 units, and BC is x, which we need to find. Also, it mentions that AC is perpendicular to BC, so those two lines form a right angle at point C. Additionally, it states that AB is the hypotenuse of the triangle because it's the side opposite the right angle. Wait, but in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. Since AB is 20 and AC is 10, then BC would be x. Let me recall the Pythagorean theorem here.

In a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. Here, since the right angle is at C, the legs are AC and BC, and the hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, according to the Pythagorean theorem:

AC² + BC² = AB²

We know AC is 10, so AC² is 100. AB is 20, so AB² is 400. Plugging into the equation:

10² + x² = 20²  
100 + x² = 400  
x² = 400 - 100  
x² = 300  
So x = sqrt(300)

Simplify sqrt(300): sqrt(100*3) = 10*sqrt(3). 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 10√3. So that should be the answer. Let me check again if I got the sides right. The right angle is at C, so AC and BC are the legs. AB is the hypotenuse. Yes, so the calculation holds. Therefore, x is 10√3, which matches option C.
