====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ. The question is asking for the measure of angle 2, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me try to visualize the rectangle first. 

Since it's a rectangle, all angles should be right angles, right? Wait, but there are some diagonals mentioned here. The lines WY and XZ are diagonals because they're called diagonals of the rectangle. Also, point A is the intersection of these two diagonals. 

Now, angle 1 is given as 30 degrees. But where is angle 1 located? The problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(2). Maybe angle 1 is formed at point A? Because the diagonals intersect at point A. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so they split each other into two equal parts. 

Let me recall that in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and they bisect each other. When two diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. If angle 1 is one of those angles created by the intersection, then maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle formed by the diagonals. 

Wait, since the diagonals intersect at point A, which divides them into two equal segments. So, triangle WAX would be formed by points W, A, and X. Similarly, triangle WAZ, etc. But how does angle 1 come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 refers to an angle formed between a side and a diagonal. For example, angle between WX and WY. Since WY is a diagonal from W to Y. Let me think. 

In a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. So, if I consider triangle WXY, but wait, in a rectangle, adjacent angles are right angles. Wait, but when you draw a diagonal, like WY, it splits the rectangle into two triangles. Each triangle has angles that can be calculated based on the sides. 

Suppose we take triangle WXY. Wait, no. Let me clarify the structure. Points W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. So, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Diagonals are WY and XZ. Their intersection is point A. 

So, angle 1 might be one of the angles formed at point A. For instance, angle between WA and AX. Or maybe angle between WA and AZ? Wait, since diagonals intersect at A, the vertical angles would be equal. If angle 1 is one of these angles, then maybe angle 1 is half of something?

But the problem states that measure of angle 6 is 90 degrees. Wait, looking back at the constraints:

- RightAngle(Angle(Y)) — probably Angle(Y) is referring to angle at point Y, but since it's a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. But maybe that's redundant information. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)),90) — so angle 6 is a right angle. 

Also, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 30 degrees. And we need to find measure of angle 2. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 refer to specific angles formed by the diagonals. For example, when two diagonals cross, they create four angles. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, then angle 2 could be its vertical angle or supplementary. 

But in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but unless it's a square, the diagonals aren't perpendicular. Wait, but if angle between the diagonals is 30 degrees, then maybe... Hmm. 

Wait, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, which is the angle between the two diagonals. Let me think. Suppose the diagonals intersect at point A. Then, depending on the rectangle's proportions, the angles between the diagonals can vary. 

For example, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular, forming 90-degree angles. But if the rectangle isn't a square, the diagonals will form different angles. 

If angle 1 is 30 degrees, then the opposite angle (vertical angle) would also be 30 degrees. The adjacent angles would be supplementary, so 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. 

But the problem says that angle 6 is 90 degrees. Wait, angle 6 could be another angle formed by the intersection. However, if the diagonals are not perpendicular, then angle 6 being 90 degrees would imply that the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, but that's only true for squares. 

Wait, there's a contradiction here? Because if angle 6 is a right angle, then the diagonals are perpendicular, making the rectangle a square. But if that's the case, then all angles formed by the diagonals would be 90 degrees. But the problem states that angle 1 is 30 degrees. That seems conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood which angles are referred to. Let me check again the constraints. 

The problem lists several angles: Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(6). Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(Y)), which is probably angle at Y, which is already a right angle. Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)),90). So angle 6 is a right angle. 

But how do these angles relate? Maybe angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals. If angle 6 is 90 degrees, then that suggests that the diagonals are perpendicular. Which would make the rectangle a square. But if that's the case, then angle 1 cannot be 30 degrees. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is not at the intersection of the diagonals. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

The constraints include:

- IntersectAt(Line(W,Y), Line(X,Z), Line(W,Y), Point(A)). So line WY intersects line XZ at point A. 

- IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,Y), Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)): So line WY is a diagonal of the rectangle. Similarly for line XZ. 

Therefore, point A is the intersection of the two diagonals. 

Then, the angles mentioned: Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(6). 

Possibly, these angles are the angles formed at point A by the intersection of the diagonals. 

So, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then angle 6 is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle 6 would be another angle at point A. If two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, if one pair is 30 and 150, and another pair is 30 and 150. But the problem says angle 6 is 90 degrees. This contradicts unless my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, maybe angle 6 is not one of the angles formed by the diagonals. Perhaps angle 6 refers to an angle elsewhere. 

Wait, the problem also includes:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)), 90): So angle at point X, between points W, X, Y. Which is a corner of the rectangle, so that's 90 degrees. Same for other corners. 

So maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are not the ones formed by the diagonals, but somewhere else. 

Looking back, the problem says:

"Find the measure of ∠2 if m∠1 = 30."

But without knowing where ∠1 and ∠2 are, it's hard to tell. However, the problem gives us several constraints about the figure. Let's try to reconstruct the diagram. 

We have rectangle WXYZ. So, points W, X, Y, Z arranged such that WX, XY, YZ, ZW are sides. Diagonals WY and XZ intersect at point A. 

Now, angles mentioned:

- Angle(1): Could be an angle formed by a side and a diagonal. For example, angle between side WX and diagonal WY at point W. 

Or maybe angle between diagonal WY and side XY at point Y. 

Similarly, angle 2 could be another angle related to the diagonals. 

Alternatively, angle 1 and angle 2 could be angles formed at point A. 

But earlier confusion arises if angle 6 is 90 degrees. Wait, the problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)),90)" and "RightAngle(Angle(Y))". 

Perhaps angle(Y) refers to angle at point Y, which is a right angle. So that's redundant. 

Angle(6) could be another angle. 

Wait, maybe angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals. For example, suppose the diagonals intersect at A, creating four angles. If one of them is 90 degrees, meaning the diagonals are perpendicular. But if angle 1 is 30 degrees, that would conflict. Unless angle 6 is not one of the angles formed at the intersection. 

This is confusing. Let me try to approach systematically. 

First, since WXYZ is a rectangle, all angles are right angles. The diagonals WY and XZ are congruent and bisect each other. The diagonals divide the rectangle into four triangles. 

If we look at triangle WAX, where A is the intersection point of the diagonals. Since diagonals bisect each other, WA = AZ and WA = AX. Wait, no. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so WA = AY and AX = AZ. Wait, the diagonals are WY and XZ. So their intersection point A divides each diagonal into two equal parts. So WA = AY and XA = AZ. 

So, in triangle WAX, WA and XA are halves of the diagonals. 

Now, suppose angle 1 is one of the angles in this triangle. For example, angle at point A between WA and XA. But if the diagonals are not perpendicular, that angle would not be 90 degrees. 

But if angle 6 is 90 degrees, then maybe angle 6 is that angle at point A. Wait, but if angle 6 is 90 degrees, then the diagonals are perpendicular, implying the rectangle is a square. But angle 1 is given as 30 degrees, which would not fit. 

Hmm. There's inconsistency here. So maybe angle 1 is not at the intersection point A. 

Alternative possibility: angle 1 is an angle formed by a diagonal and a side. For example, at vertex W, between side WX and diagonal WY. 

In that case, let's consider triangle WXY. Wait, no. At point W, the sides are WX and WZ. The diagonal WY goes from W to Y. So angle between WX and WY would be angle at W between side WX and diagonal WY. 

Similarly, angle at W between diagonal WY and side WZ. 

If angle 1 is that angle, then we can compute it using trigonometry. 

Let me assume that. Let's denote the rectangle WXYZ, with length and width. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. 

Let’s place point W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). So the rectangle has length a and height b. 

Then, diagonal WY connects (0,0) to (a,b). The slope of WY is b/a. 

The angle between side WX (which is horizontal) and diagonal WY can be computed. 

The angle θ between WX (along x-axis) and diagonal WY would satisfy tanθ = (change in y)/(change in x) = b/a. 

So θ = arctan(b/a). 

Similarly, if angle 1 is this angle θ, then m∠1 = arctan(b/a) = 30 degrees. 

Thus, tan(30°) = b/a → b/a = 1/√3 → a/b = √3. 

So, ratio of length to width is √3:1. 

Now, angle 2 could be another angle related to this setup. Let me think. What is angle 2? It might be the angle between diagonal WY and side WZ at point W. 

Wait, at point W, the sides are WX and WZ, which are perpendicular. The diagonal WY makes some angle with WX (which is angle 1, 30 degrees). Then, the angle between diagonal WY and side WZ would be 90° - 30° = 60 degrees. 

But if angle 2 is that angle, then measure of angle 2 would be 60 degrees. 

Alternatively, angle 2 could be an angle formed elsewhere. For example, at point A, the intersection of diagonals. 

But earlier issue remains regarding angle 6 being 90 degrees. 

Wait, the problem mentions Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)),90). So angle 6 is 90 degrees. If angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the diagonals, then the diagonals must be perpendicular, implying that the rectangle is a square. But this conflicts with angle 1 being 30 degrees. Hence, there's a contradiction unless angle 6 is not at the intersection. 

Wait, maybe angle 6 is not at the intersection of the diagonals but another angle. For example, if angle 6 is one of the angles formed by extending lines or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to a right angle at point Y, which is already known. But that was already covered by the RightAngle(Angle(Y)) constraint. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me refocus. Given that angle 1 is 30 degrees, and assuming it's the angle between a side and a diagonal, leading to the ratio of sides as √3:1. Then angle 2, which may be the complement of angle 1, would be 60 degrees. 

Given the answer choices include 60 as option B. So maybe the answer is B. 

Alternatively, considering the diagonals intersecting at A, forming angles. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, then the adjacent angle would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. But angle 6 is 90 degrees, which doesn't fit. 

Unless angle 6 is referring to another angle. Maybe angle between diagonal and another side. For example, if angle 6 is the angle between diagonal XZ and side XY. 

But without more info, it's hard to say. However, given the most plausible scenario where angle 1 is between a side and a diagonal, giving rise to angle 2 as 60 degrees, which matches answer B. 

Hence, the answer is likely B. 60 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 2$, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem. We are told that quadrilateral $WXYZ$ is a **rectangle**, which means all interior angles are right angles ($90^\circ$), and opposite sides are equal and parallel.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- **Rectangle Properties**:
  - All angles are $90^\circ$.
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
  - Diagonals are congruent and bisect each other.
  - Diagonals intersect at point $A$, dividing each diagonal into two equal parts.

- **Diagonals**: 
  - Lines $WY$ and $XZ$ are diagonals of the rectangle.
  - These diagonals intersect at point $A$, forming **four angles** around the intersection point.

- **Angles Mentioned**:
  - $\angle 1 = 30^\circ$
  - $\angle 6 = 90^\circ$
  - Need to find the measure of $\angle 2$

---

### Step 2: Assign Coordinates for Clarity
Assume the rectangle lies in the coordinate plane:
- Place point $W = (0, 0)$
- $X = (a, 0)$
- $Y = (a, b)$
- $Z = (0, b)$

Then:
- Diagonal $WY$: From $(0, 0)$ to $(a, b)$
- Diagonal $XZ$: From $(a, 0)$ to $(0, b)$

These diagonals intersect at point $A$. The key observation is that the angle $\angle 1 = 30^\circ$ is likely the angle between side $WX$ (horizontal axis) and diagonal $WY$.

---

### Step 3: Determine Relationship Between Sides Using Trigonometry
From the coordinate system:
- Slope of diagonal $WY = \frac{b}{a}$
- The angle between $WX$ (x-axis) and diagonal $WY$ is:
  $$
  \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
  $$

Given $\angle 1 = 30^\circ$, we have:
$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{b}{a}
\Rightarrow \frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \Rightarrow a : b = \sqrt{3} : 1
$$

---

### Step 4: Use Complementary Angles to Find $\angle 2$
At vertex $W$, the sides $WX$ and $WZ$ are perpendicular. Diagonal $WY$ forms an angle of $30^\circ$ with side $WX$.

Therefore, the angle between diagonal $WY$ and side $WZ$ is:
$$
\angle 2 = 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ
$$

This angle corresponds to $\angle 2$, which is the angle between diagonal $WY$ and side $WZ$.

---

### Final Answer
$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

Final Answer: B
