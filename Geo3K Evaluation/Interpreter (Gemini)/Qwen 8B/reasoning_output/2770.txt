MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle A here. So we have a trapezoid ABCD, right? And there are some angle constraints given. Let me start by recalling that in any quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees. The problem mentions several equalities between the angles. 

First, they say that angle A equals x. Then angle B is twice x, same with angle C. Angle D is also x. Wait, so angles A and D are both x, and angles B and C are each 2x. Let me write that down:

- Measure of Angle A = x
- Measure of Angle B = 2x
- Measure of Angle C = 2x
- Measure of Angle D = x

So adding them up, total should be x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x. But since it's a quadrilateral, the sum must be 360 degrees. Therefore, 6x = 360, which would make x = 60 degrees. Wait, but then angle A would be 60 degrees. However, hold on—the problem also mentions that it's a trapezoid. Hmm, maybe there's more to consider here?

Wait, trapezoids have at least one pair of parallel sides. In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. That is, if two sides are parallel, then adjacent angles on the same side add up to 180 degrees. Let me check the additional constraints given. 

The problem states that Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B))) = 180. So angle A plus angle B equals 180. Similarly, Add(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(D))) = 180. So angle C plus angle D equals 180. Let me plug in the variables. 

Since angle A is x and angle B is 2x, their sum is x + 2x = 3x. According to the constraint, this equals 180. So 3x = 180 → x = 60. Similarly, angle C is 2x and angle D is x. Their sum is 2x + x = 3x, which again equals 180. So same equation. So that gives us x=60. 

But wait, earlier when I added all four angles, I had 6x = 360 → x=60 as well. So both approaches give the same answer. So angle A is 60 degrees. Which would correspond to option B. But let me double-check if being a trapezoid affects anything else. 

In a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel (assuming it's a general trapezoid; if it's an isosceles trapezoid, then base angles are equal). But the problem says Trapezoid(A,B,C,D), so maybe it's a specific type. However, the given angle relationships might imply certain properties. For example, if angles A and D are both x, and angles B and C are 2x, and given that angles A+B=180 and C+D=180, that suggests that sides AB and CD are the ones that are parallel. Because if AB is parallel to CD, then angles A and D are on the same side, so they should be supplementary? Wait no—wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So if AB is parallel to CD, then angle A and angle D are on the same leg, so angle A + angle D = 180? Wait, but according to the problem, angle A + angle B = 180. So perhaps AD is parallel to BC? Or maybe AB is parallel to CD?

Let me think again. Suppose AB is parallel to CD. Then angles A and D are on the left side, so angle A and angle D would be adjacent to base AD. Wait, maybe I need to visualize the trapezoid. Let me label the vertices in order A-B-C-D-A. If AB and CD are the two bases (parallel sides), then angles at A and D are adjacent to base AD. Wait, actually, angle A is between AB and AD, and angle D is between DC and DA. Since AB || CD, then angle A and angle D are on the same side, meaning they are supplementary. Wait, but according to the problem, angle A + angle D = x + x = 2x. But if they are supplementary, then 2x = 180, so x=90. But that contradicts our previous calculation where x=60. So something's wrong here.

Wait, but according to the problem, angle A + angle B = 180. So angle A and angle B are adjacent angles on the same side. So if AB is parallel to CD, then angle A and angle B would be adjacent along AB, so they would be on different bases. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that in a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, the legs are AD and BC. Then, angles A and B are adjacent to base AB. So angle A and angle B are on the same base AB, but they are adjacent to the legs. Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, then angle A and angle D are on the same leg AD. So angle A and angle D are supplementary because they are consecutive angles on the same leg. But according to the problem, angle A + angle D = x + x = 2x. So that would mean 2x = 180, hence x=90. But earlier equations said that angle A + angle B = 180, which is x + 2x = 3x = 180, leading to x=60. Contradiction! So that suggests inconsistency unless my understanding is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid has another pair of parallel sides. For example, if AD is parallel to BC. Then angles A and B would be on the same side. Wait, if AD || BC, then angles A and B are on the same side, so they would be supplementary. So angle A + angle B = 180. Which matches the given condition. Similarly, angles C and D would be on the same side, so angle C + angle D = 180. Which also matches the given condition. 

So if AD is parallel to BC, then angles A and B are supplementary, and angles C and D are supplementary. So in this case, angles A and B are on the same leg (AD and BC?), no, if AD is parallel to BC, then AB and CD are the legs. Wait, maybe I need to draw it mentally. Let me imagine trapezoid ABCD with AD || BC. Then AB and CD are the non-parallel sides. Then angles at A and B are adjacent to base AB. Wait, if AD || BC, then angles at A and B are on different bases. Maybe I need to use the property that consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that the problem already includes those supplementary conditions. So even though the trapezoid has two pairs of supplementary angles, the given constraints lead us to x=60. But why does the trapezoid condition affect this? Because in a trapezoid, the sum of angles on the same side must be 180. But according to the problem, angle A + angle B = 180 and angle C + angle D = 180. Which fits with the trapezoid properties. So regardless of which sides are parallel, these conditions are satisfied. 

Therefore, solving using the given equations, x=60. So angle A is 60 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, B is 60. So answer is B. 

But let me check again. Let me re-express all equations. Given:

Sum of all angles: x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x = 360 ⇒ x=60. Also, angle A + angle B = x + 2x = 3x = 180 ⇒ x=60. Same for angle C + angle D = 2x + x = 3x = 180. So yes, consistent. Thus, angle A is 60 degrees. Hence answer B.
