MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, and a circle centered at B. All points A, C, D lie on the circle because they're on Circle(B). That means BA, BC, BD are radii of the circle since they connect the center B to points on the circle. Also, it says that lines BA, BC, BD are congruent, which makes sense because they're all radii of the same circle. 

Now, looking at the angles mentioned. The measure of angle ABC (which is Angle(A,B,C)) is 65 degrees. Then angle CBD (Angle(C,B,D)) is 132 degrees. And we need to find the measure of angle ABD (Angle(A,B,D)), which is denoted as x. There's also a condition that the sum of these three angles equals 360 degrees. Wait, but angles around a point? Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Point B is the center of the circle. Points A, C, D are on the circumference. Lines BA, BC, BD are radii. So, angles at point B. Let me think about how these angles relate. 

The first angle is ABC, which is between BA and BC. The second is CBD, between CB and DB. The third is ABD, between BA and BD. If you add those three angles together, they might form a full circle around point B. Wait, because if you imagine starting from BA, going through BC, then turning towards BD, and then closing back... But wait, angles at a point should add up to 360 degrees. However, angle ABC is between BA and BC, angle CBD is between BC and BD, and angle ABD is between BA and BD. Wait, so adding them would actually be angle ABC + angle CBD + angle ABD? Wait no, that can't be right. Because angle ABC is part of the triangle ABC, and angle CBD is another part. Maybe there's some overlapping here.

Wait, perhaps the sum of angles around point B is 360 degrees. Let me clarify. The angles around point B are formed by the lines BA, BC, BD. Since there are three lines emanating from B, they divide the plane into three angles. But depending on their arrangement, the sum of those angles should be 360 degrees. However, the given angles are ABC, CBD, and ABD. Let me check:

- Angle ABC is between BA and BC.
- Angle CBD is between CB and BD.
- Angle ABD is between BA and BD.

If you add angle ABC and angle CBD, that would be the total angle from BA to BD via BC. But angle ABD is directly between BA and BD. Therefore, angle ABC + angle CBD = angle ABD? Wait, that seems conflicting. Or perhaps not. Let me think again.

Imagine standing at point B. If you look along BA, then turn towards BC, that's angle ABC. Then from BC, turning towards BD gives angle CBD. So the total angle from BA to BD is angle ABC + angle CBD. But angle ABD is the direct angle from BA to BD. Therefore, angle ABD should equal angle ABC + angle CBD. But according to the problem statement, the sum of angle ABC, angle CBD, and angle ABD equals 360 degrees. Wait, that would mean angle ABC + angle CBD + angle ABD = 360. But if angle ABD is equal to angle ABC + angle CBD, then substituting that into the equation would give angle ABC + angle CBD + (angle ABC + angle CBD) = 360 → 2*(angle ABC + angle CBD) = 360 → angle ABC + angle CBD = 180. But given angle ABC is 65°, angle CBD is 132°, their sum is 65+132=197°, which isn't 180. So something's wrong here. Maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angles aren't adjacent? Wait, but all three angles share vertex B. Let me consider the positions of points A, C, D on the circle. Since BA, BC, BD are radii, points A, C, D are all on the circumference. Depending on their order, the angles could vary. For example, if points A, C, D are placed such that when you go from BA to BC to BD, the angles between them are as specified.

But let me re-examine the problem. It says the sum of the measures of angle ABC, angle CBD, and angle ABD equals 360 degrees. Wait, that's strange. Normally, around a point, the sum of angles is 360 degrees. But if angle ABC, angle CBD, and angle ABD are three angles around point B, then their sum should be 360. However, angle ABC is between BA and BC, angle CBD is between BC and BD, and angle ABD is between BA and BD. Wait, but angle ABD is the same as the combination of angle ABC and angle CBD. Unless the points are arranged in a different way. 

Wait, perhaps the points are not all on the same side. Suppose points A, C, D are arranged such that when you go from BA to BC, then from BC to BD, but BD is in the opposite direction? Wait, but angles around a point should add up to 360. Let me try to write equations.

Let’s denote:

Let’s call angle ABC = α = 65°, angle CBD = β = 132°, and angle ABD = x. According to the problem, α + β + x = 360°. Plugging in the values: 65 + 132 + x = 360 → 197 + x = 360 → x = 360 - 197 = 163°. So x would be 163°, which is option C. But wait, why does the sum of these three angles equal 360?

But earlier reasoning suggested that angle ABD should be equal to α + β. But according to this, angle ABD is x, and α + β + x = 360. Which suggests that x is not equal to α + β. So perhaps my previous thought was wrong. Let me think again.

If points A, C, D are arranged such that when you look from point B, the angles between BA and BC is α, between BC and BD is β, and between BA and BD is x. But unless the points are arranged in a certain way. Wait, but if you have three rays from B: BA, BC, BD. The angles between each pair of rays would be:

Between BA and BC: α = 65°

Between BC and BD: β = 132°

Between BD and BA: ?

But the total around point B is 360°, so the third angle would be 360 - α - β = 360 - 65 -132 = 163°, which is the angle between BD and BA. But angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD, so that would be 163°, hence x = 163°. Therefore, the answer would be C.

But wait, angle ABD is between BA and BD. So yes, that third angle is indeed x. Therefore, the sum of the three angles around point B is 360°, so 65 + 132 + x = 360 → x = 163. Hence, answer C. But let me make sure there are no errors in assuming that the three angles are adjacent and cover the entire 360° around point B.

Another way: Imagine three lines BA, BC, BD coming out of point B. Each pair forms an angle. The angles between BA & BC is 65°, between BC & BD is 132°, and between BD & BA is x. Adding them up gives 65 + 132 + x = 360. So solving for x gives 163. Therefore, answer is C. 

But let me check if there's any possibility that the angles are not adjacent. For instance, maybe angle ABD is not the third angle. Wait, if points A, C, D are arranged such that C and D are on opposite sides relative to BA. But the problem states that all points A, C, D are on the circle. Since BA, BC, BD are all radii, they are all length equal. So the triangle ABC and CBD are both isosceles triangles.

But regardless of that, the key thing is the angles around point B. The problem says that the sum of the three angles is 360°, which is only possible if they are the three angles around point B. Thus, the calculation seems valid. Hence, x = 163°, which is option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
