MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So we have two similar triangles, ABC and DEF. BG is a median in triangle ABC, and EH is a median in triangle DEF. We need to find the length of EH given that BC is 30, BG is 15, and EF is 15. The answer choices are A. 7.5, B. 15, C. 22.5, D. 30.

First, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Also, medians in similar triangles should be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides. Let me recall the properties of medians in triangles. 

In a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So BG is a median from B to AC, meaning G is the midpoint of AC. Similarly, EH is a median from E to DF, so H is the midpoint of DF. 

Given that ABC ~ DEF, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let's denote the ratio of similarity as k. That means each side of ABC is k times the corresponding side of DEF. 

But wait, which sides correspond? Since the order of the vertices is important for similarity. Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF, so angle A corresponds to D, B to E, and C to F. Therefore, AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to EF, and AC corresponds to DF. 

So BC corresponds to EF. Given BC = 30 and EF = 15. Therefore, the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF would be BC/EF = 30/15 = 2. Wait, but hold on—since ABC is similar to DEF, the ratio depends on which way the similarity is. If ABC ~ DEF, then the ratio of AB/DE = BC/EF = AC/DF. 

But here, BC corresponds to EF. So the ratio of ABC to DEF is BC / EF = 30 / 15 = 2. So that means every side of ABC is twice as long as the corresponding side in DEF. Therefore, the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF is 2:1. 

Now, medians. In similar triangles, the medians are also in the same ratio as the sides. So the median from B in ABC (BG) should be twice the median from E in DEF (EH). Because the medians are corresponding parts of the similar triangles. 

Wait, let me confirm that. If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding medians are in the same ratio as their corresponding sides. So since BG is a median in ABC and EH is the corresponding median in DEF, then BG/EH = ratio of similarity. Which is ABC to DEF, so BG/EH = 2. 

We know BG is 15, so 15/EH = 2 → EH = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So that would make EH equal to 7.5, which is option A. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I got the ratio reversed?

Wait, if ABC ~ DEF, then the ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1. So the medians would follow the same ratio. So BG (median of ABC) is twice EH (median of DEF). Hence, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the ratio of the medians. Another approach: In triangle ABC, BG is a median. Since ABC ~ DEF, then the ratio of BG to EH is the same as the ratio of BC to EF. Since BC is 30 and EF is 15, that ratio is 2. So BG/EH = 2, hence EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So yes, same conclusion.

Wait, but another thought: What if the medians themselves are corresponding? For example, BG is the median from B to AC in ABC, and EH is the median from E to DF in DEF. Since ABC ~ DEF, the correspondence of the medians would be the same as the correspondence of the sides. So BG corresponds to EH. Therefore, their lengths are in the ratio of the similarity. 

Therefore, BG / EH = BC / EF = 30 / 15 = 2. Thus, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A. 

But let me check once more. Suppose the ratio of similarity is ABC : DEF = 2:1. Then all corresponding linear measurements, including medians, would be in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, BG (from ABC) is twice EH (from DEF). Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A. 

But let me see if there's any chance that the ratio could be different. For example, sometimes people confuse the ratio based on which triangle they're comparing. Like if the question says ABC ~ DEF, then the ratio is AB/DE = BC/EF = AC/DF. So BC corresponds to EF. So BC/EF = 30/15 = 2. So ABC is larger than DEF by factor 2. Therefore, the median BG in ABC corresponds to median EH in DEF. So BG = 2 * EH. Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. 

Yes, so the answer should be A. However, looking at the answer choices, A is 7.5, which seems correct. But let me check if there's another possible mistake. 

Another way: Using coordinates. Let me try to imagine coordinates. Let’s assume coordinates for triangle ABC. Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (30, 0) because BC=30. Then, since BG is a median, G is the midpoint of AC. But without knowing coordinates of A, it's hard. Alternatively, since BG is a median, and its length is 15. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, BG is a median. So in triangle ABC, the median from B to AC. The length of the median can be calculated using the formula:

The length of a median m_b from vertex B is given by:

m_b² = (2a² + 2c² - b²)/4

Where a, c are the lengths of the sides adjacent to B, and b is the side opposite. Wait, but here, in triangle ABC, the median from B to AC. Let me clarify: In triangle ABC, the median from B goes to the midpoint of AC. Let me denote AB = c, BC = a, AC = b. Wait, standard notation is usually a opposite A, etc., but maybe confusing here. Let me define variables properly.

Let me consider triangle ABC with points A, B, C. Let me assign labels. Let me say BC = 30, which is given. BG is the median from B to AC. So point G is the midpoint of AC. The length of BG is 15. Now, how does this relate to the triangle's sides?

Alternatively, since ABC is similar to DEF, with BC corresponding to EF. And EF is given as 15. So BC/EF = 30/15 = 2. So ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1. Therefore, all corresponding medians are in the same ratio. So BG corresponds to EH, so BG / EH = 2. Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A.

But perhaps someone might think that since BG is half of BC? No, that's not necessarily true. Because in a triangle, the median isn't necessarily half the length of the side unless it's a specific case like in an equilateral triangle. Here, we don't know the type of triangle. But since BG is a median, and BC is a side. 

But in our case, the key is the similarity ratio between the two triangles. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their medians equals the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the ratio of BG to EH equals the ratio of BC to EF, which is 30 to 15, so 2. Therefore, BG = 2*EH. Solving gives EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. Therefore, answer A.

I think that's solid reasoning. Unless there's some detail I missed. Let me check the problem statement again. It mentions that BG is a median of triangle ABC, and EH is a median of triangle DEF. Also, the triangles are similar. All the given conditions seem to support the ratio of similarity being 2:1, leading to EH = 7.5. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. 7.5.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ EH $ in triangle $ \triangle DEF $, we begin by analyzing the given information and applying the principles of **similar triangles** and **medians**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Similarity Ratio

We are told that $ \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF $, and the correspondence of vertices implies:

- Side $ BC $ of triangle $ ABC $ corresponds to side $ EF $ of triangle $ DEF $
- Therefore, the similarity ratio is:
  $$
  \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2
  $$

This tells us that triangle $ ABC $ is **twice as large** as triangle $ DEF $ in terms of all linear dimensions, including **medians**.

---

### Step 2: Use the Median Correspondence

We’re told:

- $ BG $ is a median of $ \triangle ABC $
- $ EH $ is a median of $ \triangle DEF $

Since these are **corresponding medians** of similar triangles, their lengths are also in the same ratio as the similarity ratio of the triangles:

$$
\frac{BG}{EH} = \frac{BC}{EF} = 2
$$

Substitute the known value of $ BG = 15 $ into the equation:

$$
\frac{15}{EH} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad EH = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
$$

---

### Final Answer

Thus, the length of $ EH $ is:

$$
\boxed{7.5}
$$

Final Answer: A
