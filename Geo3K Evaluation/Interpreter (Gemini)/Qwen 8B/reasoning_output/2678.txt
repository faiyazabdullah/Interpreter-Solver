====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate. Let me start by listing out all the given points and constraints.

We have a circle labeled A. Points F, B, H, G, J lie on this circle. So that means these five points are all on the circumference of circle A. Then there are lines mentioned: FH, GJ, GH, and HJ. Also, angles 1, 2, and 3 are defined. There are some specific conditions:

- Angle 1 is a right angle (right angle).
- Line GH is perpendicular to line HJ, so they form a right angle at point H.
- The measure of angle 2 is twice x, and angle 3 is x. Also, the sum of angles 2 and 3 equals 90 degrees.
- Additionally, FH and GJ are diameters of circle A. Since diameters pass through the center, their endpoints are on opposite sides of the circle.

Also, triangle GHJ is a right triangle. Wait, since GH and HJ are connected, and we know GH is perpendicular to HJ, then triangle GHJ has a right angle at H. Therefore, triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. That makes sense because the two legs GH and HJ are perpendicular.

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle 2, which is given as 2x, and we know that angle 2 + angle 3 = 90°, with angle 3 being x. So solving those equations would give us the value of x, and then double it for angle 2.

But wait, maybe there's more to it? Because the problem involves circles and diameters, perhaps there are inscribed angles or something related to central angles?

Let me think again. Since FH and GJ are diameters of circle A, their endpoints are on the circle. Let me note that FH is a diameter, so points F and H are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, G and J are endpoints of another diameter. 

So, since FH is a diameter, then the arc from F to H is 180 degrees. Similarly, the arc from G to J is also 180 degrees.

Now, considering triangle GHJ. Since G and J are endpoints of a diameter, then the line GJ is a diameter. But H is another point on the circle. Wait, but H is also on the circle. So, triangle GHJ has vertices on the circle. However, since GJ is a diameter, then angle at H should be a right angle. Wait, but that's already given as part of the problem statement—triangle GHJ is right-angled. So that aligns with Thales' theorem, which states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that diameter is a right angle. Therefore, angle at H is 90 degrees. Which matches the given condition that Triangle(G,H,J) is Right(Triangle(G,H,J)).

Wait, but in our case, the triangle is GHJ, with GJ being the diameter, so angle at H is the right angle. Therefore, angle at H is 90 degrees. However, in the problem, they mention angle 1 is a right angle. Maybe angle 1 refers to angle at H? Or is angle 1 referring to something else?

Looking back, the problem mentions:

- PointLiesOnCircle(F, Circle(A)), etc. So points F, B, H, G, J are on the circle.

Lines:

- Line(F,H): which is a diameter, since FH is a diameter.

- Line(G,J): another diameter.

Then, lines GH and HJ are drawn. So GH connects G to H, and HJ connects H to J.

Then, Angle(1) is a right angle. It might refer to the angle between lines GH and HJ? Because Perpendicular(Line(G,H), Line(J,H)) is stated. So line GH is perpendicular to line HJ. Thus, angle between GH and HJ at point H is a right angle. Therefore, angle 1 is that right angle. So angle 1 is 90 degrees.

But the problem says "Angle(1)" is a right angle. So that's angle at H between GH and HJ. So angle 1 = 90 degrees.

Then, angles 2 and 3 are mentioned. The problem states:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), Mul(2,x))

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), x)

- Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))), 90)

Therefore, angle 2 + angle 3 = 90 degrees. And angle 2 is 2x, angle 3 is x. So:

2x + x = 90 → 3x = 90 → x = 30. Hence, angle 2 is 2x = 60 degrees. So the answer would be 60, which is option C.

Wait, but why are angles 2 and 3 mentioned here? Where do these angles come into play? Are they parts of triangle GHJ?

Wait, triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. So the angles at G and J must add up to 90 degrees. But the problem refers to angles 2 and 3. Let me check the exact wording:

The problem says:

Angle(1) is a right angle.

Perpendicular(Line(G,H), Line(J,H)) — meaning angle between GH and HJ is 90 degrees, which is angle 1.

Then, angle 2 and angle 3 are such that angle 2 is 2x and angle 3 is x, adding to 90. So perhaps angles 2 and 3 are the other two angles in triangle GHJ?

Since triangle GHJ is right-angled at H (angle 1), then angles at G and J are complementary. So angle at G plus angle at J equals 90 degrees. If angle 2 and angle 3 are those two angles, then their sum is 90. So angle 2 could be angle at G, angle 3 at J, or vice versa.

But according to the problem, angle 2 is twice angle 3. So if angle 2 is larger than angle 3, then angle 2 would be at G, and angle 3 at J. Then solving gives x=30, angle 2=60. Hence, answer C.

But wait, is there any other consideration involving the circle? For example, could angles 2 and 3 be related to arcs or inscribed angles?

Alternatively, maybe angles 2 and 3 are angles formed by intersecting chords or something else?

Wait, but given that all points are on the circle, and FH and GJ are diameters, perhaps there are relationships between angles based on arcs.

For instance, consider angle at G in triangle GHJ. Since GJ is a diameter, and H is another point on the circle. So angle at G is subtended by arc HJ. Alternatively, angle at G could be an inscribed angle.

But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180 degrees. The point H is somewhere on the circle. So depending on where H is located relative to G and J, the arcs would vary.

But maybe we can find relations using inscribed angles. Let me try.

In triangle GHJ, which is right-angled at H. So angles at G and J are acute angles adding to 90 degrees.

If angle 2 and angle 3 are those two angles, then their measures are 2x and x, adding to 90. Solving gives x=30, so angle 2 is 60. That seems straightforward. But why does the problem include all the other information about the circle and diameters? Is there a possibility that my assumption is wrong?

Wait, perhaps angle 2 and angle 3 aren't necessarily angles of triangle GHJ? Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem mentions angles 1, 2, and 3. Angle 1 is a right angle (so that's the angle between GH and HJ). Then angles 2 and 3 are defined with the equations given. But where are angles 2 and 3 located?

The problem doesn't specify explicitly where angles 2 and 3 are, but since they are referred to in relation to the diagram, perhaps they are angles formed by certain lines. Let me think.

Another possibility: maybe angles 2 and 3 are angles formed by the intersection of lines FH and GJ with other lines. For example, since FH is a diameter, and GH is a line connecting G to H, maybe angle 2 is an angle formed by FH and GH?

Alternatively, since FH is a diameter, and H is an endpoint of that diameter. So line FH passes through the center of the circle. Similarly, line GJ is another diameter passing through the center.

Given that, perhaps there are intersections or other angles involved.

But without knowing the exact positions of points F, B, H, G, J, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem provides enough information to solve the equation 2x + x = 90, leading directly to x=30, angle 2=60, which corresponds to option C.

But maybe there's a catch here. Let me verify again.

Suppose angles 2 and 3 are indeed the two non-right angles in triangle GHJ. Since triangle GHJ is right-angled at H, then angles at G and J are supplementary to each other, adding up to 90 degrees. Given that angle 2 is twice angle 3, then:

Let’s denote angle at G as angle 2 (which is 2x) and angle at J as angle 3 (which is x). Then:

2x + x = 90 => 3x = 90 => x = 30. So angle 2 is 60 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C.

Alternatively, if angle 2 was the angle at J and angle 3 at G, then angle 3 would be twice angle 2, but the problem says angle 2 is twice angle 3, so angle 2 is larger. Hence, angle at G is larger, angle at J smaller. So that still holds.

But why does the problem mention the circle and diameters? Perhaps there's another way to approach this using circle theorems, which may confirm the same answer.

Let me explore that. Suppose we look at the circle with diameters FH and GJ. Let me imagine the circle with center O, the midpoint of FH and GJ. Since both FH and GJ are diameters, their midpoints are the center O.

Points G and J are endpoints of one diameter, so O is the midpoint of GJ. Similarly, O is the midpoint of FH.

Now, looking at triangle GHJ, which is right-angled at H. So H lies on the circle, and GJ is a diameter. By Thales’ theorem, angle at H is a right angle, which is consistent.

Now, considering angles at G and J in triangle GHJ. These angles depend on the arcs they subtend. For example, angle at G is an inscribed angle subtending arc from H to J. Similarly, angle at J subtends arc from H to G.

Let me calculate those arcs. Since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180 degrees. The position of H determines the arcs HG and HJ.

But unless we have more info about the positions of H, it's hard to determine the exact measures. However, maybe there's symmetry or other relationships.

Alternatively, since FH is a diameter, and H is an endpoint of that diameter. So if I consider point H, then F is the other endpoint. So line FH goes through the center O.

Similarly, GJ is another diameter. Now, considering line GH and HJ. Since H is on the circle, and G and J are endpoints of another diameter.

But without knowing the exact configuration, perhaps the key is that angles at G and J in triangle GHJ are determined by the arcs they subtend. However, since we don't have specific arc measures, maybe we can use the fact that angles 2 and 3 add to 90, and angle 2 is twice angle 3, giving x=30, angle 2=60.

This suggests that regardless of the circle's specifics, the relationship between the angles is fixed by the given equations. Therefore, even though the problem includes many details about the circle, the actual answer hinges on the algebraic relationship between angles 2 and 3, which are parts of the right triangle GHJ.

Thus, the answer should be 60 degrees, which is option C.

I don't see any conflicting information here. The presence of the circle and diameters confirms that triangle GHJ is right-angled, which allows the angles to add up as specified. Therefore, solving the equation 2x + x = 90 gives x=30, making angle 2 equal to 60 degrees. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's break down the key components and apply geometric principles systematically.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are told that:
- **Points** $ F, B, H, G, J $ lie on **circle A**, implying they are all on the circumference.
- Lines:
  - $ \text{Line}(F, H) $ and $ \text{Line}(G, J) $ are **diameters** of the circle.
  - $ \text{Line}(G, H) $ and $ \text{Line}(H, J) $ are connected, forming triangle $ \triangle GHJ $.
- **Angles**:
  - $ \angle 1 $ is a **right angle**.
  - $ \angle 2 = 2x $
  - $ \angle 3 = x $
  - $ \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 90^\circ $

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Triangle $ \triangle GHJ $**

From the given data:
- Since $ \text{Line}(G, J) $ is a diameter, and point $ H $ lies on the circle, **Thales' Theorem** applies.
- This implies that **$ \angle GHJ = 90^\circ $** (i.e., $ \angle 1 $).
- Therefore, triangle $ \triangle GHJ $ is a **right triangle**, right-angled at $ H $.

This tells us that the remaining two angles, namely $ \angle 2 $ and $ \angle 3 $, are the **acute angles** of the triangle and must sum to $ 90^\circ $, since the total sum of interior angles in a triangle is always $ 180^\circ $.

---

### **Step 3: Use the Given Angle Relationships**

We are told:
$$
\text{Measure}(\angle 2) = 2x,\quad \text{Measure}(\angle 3) = x,\quad \text{and}\quad \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 90^\circ
$$

Substituting:
$$
2x + x = 90^\circ \Rightarrow 3x = 90^\circ \Rightarrow x = 30^\circ
$$

Now, compute $ \angle 2 $:
$$
\angle 2 = 2x = 2 \cdot 30^\circ = 60^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle 2 $ is $ 60^\circ $. Among the given answer choices:

- A. 30  
- B. 45  
- C. 60  
- D. 90  

The correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
