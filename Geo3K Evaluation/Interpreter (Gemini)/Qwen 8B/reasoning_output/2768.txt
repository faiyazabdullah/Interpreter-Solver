MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 4 given the information. So, first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the points and lines mentioned. There are multiple points labeled A through T and W, but the key elements here are the lines and angles specified.

The problem states that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 4. Let me start by recalling the given lines and their relationships. 

First, there's a line BW and another line AD, which are parallel (since Parallel(Line(B,W), Line(A,D)) is given). Also, there are several points lying on these lines. For instance, point F lies on line BW, Q lies on line AD, G lies on AD, N also lies on AD. Similarly, J is on BW, M is on line JM. Wait, line JM? The line J,M is mentioned, so maybe that's a different line. But perhaps some intersections or transversals?

Since lines BW and AD are parallel, and there might be transversal lines cutting them, creating various angles. Angles 1, 3, and 4 could be related through these intersections. Let me think about the possible configurations.

Let me note down the important parts:

- Lines BW || AD
- Points F on BW, Q, G, N on AD
- Lines FC, GN, JK (wait, EK?), JM, etc. Maybe some triangles or intersecting lines forming angles.

But the angles mentioned are Angle(1), Angle(2), ..., up to Angle(8). But only angles 1, 3, and 4 are referenced in the question. However, without seeing the actual figure, it's challenging, but maybe we can deduce using standard geometric principles.

Given that lines BW and AD are parallel, then if there's a transversal, say line FC connecting points F (on BW) to C (maybe somewhere else?), but wait, point C is connected via line FC. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe line FC intersects AD at some point?

Wait, the line FC is mentioned as Line(F,C). Since F is on BW and C is another point. If line FC crosses AD, since AD is parallel to BW, then there might be corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Alternatively, considering that angle 1 is 50 degrees. Suppose angle 1 is formed at the intersection of two lines. For example, if line FC is a transversal between the parallel lines BW and AD. Then angle 1 could be an angle formed by the transversal FC with line BW, and angle 3 could be an angle formed with line AD. Since they're parallel, corresponding angles would be equal. But angle 1 is 50, angle 3 is 60. That seems conflicting unless they are supplementary or something else.

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are consecutive interior angles? Wait, if they are on the same side of the transversal, then they would add up to 180 degrees. But 50 + 60 = 110, which isn't 180. Hmm. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles or something else. Or perhaps angle 1 is part of a triangle with angle 3?

Wait, maybe I should consider specific constructions. Let me try to imagine or sketch mentally:

Assume lines BW and AD are parallel. Let me consider line FC connecting point F (on BW) to point C. If line FC intersects AD at some point, say point G (since G lies on AD). Wait, point G is on AD. So line FG connects F on BW to G on AD. Therefore, line FG is a transversal between the parallel lines BW and AD. Then, angles formed by this transversal could relate to each other.

If angle 1 is at point F on line BW, then maybe angle between BF and FG? And angle 3 could be at point G on line AD, between AG and FG? If those are corresponding angles, they should be equal, but here angle 1 is 50 and angle 3 is 60, which aren't equal. So that suggests they are not corresponding. What if they are alternate interior angles? Then they should be equal, but again 50 vs 60. Not matching.

So maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are not directly related by being corresponding or alternate interior. Perhaps they are part of different triangles or involve other lines.

Another possibility: angle 1 and angle 3 are angles within a triangle or quadrilateral. For example, if there's a triangle involving points F, C, and another point, leading to angle relations.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle where angle 3 is another angle, and we use triangle sum theorem. But without knowing more, it's hard to tell.

Wait, looking back at the given lines:

Other lines include Line(F,C), Line(G,N), Line(J,M), Line(E,K), Line(Q,N). Also, Point Q is on AD, as well as G and N. So line QN is mentioned. Since Q, G, N are on AD, then line QN is just a segment along AD? Unless N is a different point. Wait, point N is on AD, and line QN connects Q to N. So Q and N are both on AD, making line QN colinear with AD, hence a straight line. So that might not create an angle.

Similarly, line J,M: point J is on BW, and line JM is drawn. So line JM starts at J on BW and goes to M, which is on line JM (as per PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(J,M))). Wait, that's redundant because M is on line JM by definition. Maybe M is another point on line JM, but not sure.

Perhaps there are multiple intersections. For example, line FC intersects AD at G, line EN (line QN?)... Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since there are multiple angles named, perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by different transversals.

Wait, angle measures are given for angle 1 and angle 3, and we need angle 4. Let's assume that angle 4 is related through some triangle or transversal.

Let me think of another approach. Since lines BW || AD, and suppose there's a transversal crossing them. Let's assume line FC is a transversal. At point F on BW, angle 1 is formed between BW and FC. Then, at point G on AD (where FC meets AD), angle 3 is formed between AD and FC. Since lines are parallel, the angles would be either equal (if they are corresponding or alternate) or supplementary (if consecutive interior).

But angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, which don't fit into those categories. Hence, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are not directly related by the transversal FC. So perhaps another transversal?

Looking at other lines. For example, line EN: Wait, line QN is given. Point Q is on AD, and N is on AD. So line QN is just part of AD. No angle there. Line GN: point G is on AD, and N is also on AD. So line GN is along AD. So no new info.

What about line JM? Point J is on BW, and line JM goes to M. But where is point M? It says PointM lies on line JM, which is trivial. Maybe M is another intersection point?

Alternatively, maybe line JM intersects line AD or BW at some point, forming angles. If line JM is a transversal, then maybe angles formed with the parallel lines BW and AD.

Alternatively, considering angle 4. The question asks for angle 4. Without seeing the figure, it's tricky, but maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle or something related to the angles given.

Wait, sometimes in such problems, you have to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or in a triangle, the sum is 180°, or use properties of parallel lines.

Let me think again about the transversal. Suppose line FC is a transversal between BW and AD, forming angles. At point F, angle 1 is 50°, which could be an angle between BW and FC. Then, the corresponding angle on AD would be equal, so maybe angle at G would be 50°, but angle 3 is given as 60°, which conflicts. Therefore, maybe angle 1 is not a corresponding angle but maybe an alternate interior angle? Wait, if line FC is a transversal, then alternate interior angles would be on opposite sides of the transversal. If angle 1 is on one side, then its alternate interior angle would be on the other side, but if angle 3 is that, then they should be equal. Again, conflict.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are supplementary. For example, if they are consecutive interior angles. Then, 50 + 60 = 110, which is less than 180, so that's not possible. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are in different configurations. Let me think about other lines. For example, line EK is mentioned. Point E is connected to K via line EK. If EK intersects AD or BW at some point, creating angles.

Alternatively, since there are multiple lines and points, maybe there are multiple triangles involved. For example, triangle formed by points F, C, and another point. Or triangle involving points G, N, and others.

Wait, the problem mentions angle 4. Maybe angle 4 is an angle formed by the intersection of two lines, like line FC and line JM or something similar. Without knowing the exact positions, it's hard, but perhaps we can infer through relationships.

Another thought: since BW || AD, any transversal will create certain angle relationships. Suppose angle 1 is an angle formed by a transversal with BW, and angle 3 is formed by another transversal with AD. But how do these relate?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle. For example, if they are two angles of a triangle, then the third angle can be found. But we need more information.

Wait, let's consider that angle 1 is 50°, and angle 3 is 60°. If these angles are in a triangle, then the third angle would be 70°, since 50+60=110, so 180-110=70. Maybe angle 4 is that 70°, which would make answer D. But this is speculative. How can I know if they are in a triangle?

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle to a triangle where angles 1 and 3 are remote interior angles. Then, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So angle 4 would be 50+60=110°, but that's not among the choices. Wait, the choices are 40, 50, 60, 70. So 110 isn't there. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is vertical angles or supplementary to one of the given angles. For example, if angle 4 is adjacent to angle 1, then it could be 180-50=130, which isn't an option. If it's vertical to angle 3, then it would be 60, but that's option C. But why would angle 4 be vertical to angle 3?

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is part of a linear pair with angle 1 or 3. For instance, if angle 4 and angle 1 form a straight line, then angle 4 would be 130, not in choices. If angle 4 and angle 3 are supplementary, then angle 4 would be 120, also not in choices.

Wait, maybe the key is that lines BW and AD are parallel, and there's a transversal creating angles that relate to each other. Suppose line FC intersects BW at F and AD at G. Then, the angles formed at F and G would be related. Let's say angle at F (angle 1) is 50°, then the corresponding angle at G would also be 50°, but angle 3 is 60°, which contradicts. Unless angle 3 is another angle formed by the same transversal.

For example, if line FC creates an angle of 50° at F (angle 1), then the angle at G could be 50° as well (corresponding), or 130° as the supplementary angle. But angle 3 is given as 60°, which may not align. So maybe angle 3 is formed by another transversal.

Suppose there's another transversal, say line JM, which intersects BW at J and AD at M (since J is on BW and M is on line JM; assuming line JM intersects AD at M). Then, if angle 3 is formed by this transversal, perhaps it relates to angle 1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving angles 1, 3, and 4. For example, if three angles in a triangle are 50°, 60°, and x, then x would be 70°, making angle 4 equal to 70°, which is option D. This seems plausible. But how to confirm?

Without seeing the figure, it's challenging, but often in such problems, when two angles are given and you're asked for a third, especially in a triangle, the third angle would be the supplement or complement. Given that angle 1 and angle 3 are 50 and 60, adding to 110, the remaining angle would be 70. Thus, angle 4 could be 70°, which is option D.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is an exterior angle, then it would be the sum of two remote interior angles. For example, if angle 4 is outside a triangle with angles 1 and 3 inside, then angle 4 = 50 + 60 = 110, which is not an option. But since that's not available, maybe the triangle idea is better.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is a vertical angle to another angle that's 70°, but I'm speculating.

Considering the answer choices, and common angle problems, the most likely answer is D. 70°, as the third angle in a triangle with angles 50 and 60. So I'll go with D.
