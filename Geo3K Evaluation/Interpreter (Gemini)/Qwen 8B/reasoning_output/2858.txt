MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the figure based on the given points and angles. Let me jot down all the information provided.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. The angles mentioned are:

- Angle at ADB (Angle(A,D,B)) = 68 degrees.
- Angle at DBE (Angle(D,B,E)) = 3x -15 degrees.
- Angle at DAE (Angle(D,A,E)) = 2x degrees.
- Angle at ACE (Angle(A,C,E)) = y² degrees.

Also, there's a quadrilateral ABD A, which seems like a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, D, A? Wait, that might be a typo or maybe it's meant to be a triangle? Wait, Quadrilateral(A,B,D,A) – but three points can't form a quadrilateral. Maybe it's supposed to be a triangle? Or perhaps a quadrilateral with points A, B, D, and another point? Wait, maybe it's a quadrilateral A-B-D-E-A? But the notation isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe it's a triangle ABD since quadrilaterals require four distinct points. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the name. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "Quadrilateral(A,B,D,A)". That would imply four points: A, B, D, A. Which is just a triangle because two points are repeated. So maybe that's a typo and should be Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)? Or perhaps Triangle(A,B,D)? Because otherwise, the quadrilateral part is confusing. Similarly, Triangle(A,B,C) is straightforward. 

But given the angles involved, maybe we can proceed without focusing too much on the quadrilateral. Let's see. Also, the sum of certain angles equals 360 degrees. The SumOf statement mentions MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(A,A,D?), wait, no:

The SumOf includes MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)), and then adds 360. Wait, the original line says:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)),360)

Wait, that seems odd. Wait, the syntax here might be that the sum of those four angle measures plus 360 equals something? Or maybe the sum of those four angles equals 360? Let me parse it again.

Original line: SumOf(...) equals 360? The way it's written: SumOf(angle1, angle2, angle3, angle4, 360). Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Perhaps the intended meaning is that the sum of the measures of those four angles is equal to 360 degrees?

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf function takes multiple arguments and sums them up. For example, if the SumOf is equal to 360, then:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 360 degrees.

Wait, but why include Angle(B,A,D)? Let me think about the points. Let's consider the diagram.

First, let's note that Angle(A,D,B) is the angle at point D between points A and B. So that's ∠ADB. Then, Angle(D,B,E) is the angle at point B between points D and E, so ∠DBE. Angle(D,A,E) is the angle at point A between points D and E, so ∠DAE. And Angle(B,A,D) is the angle at point A between points B and D, which would be ∠BAD. Wait, but in a quadrilateral or triangle?

Given that there's a quadrilateral ABD A, which I'm still confused about, but maybe it's a triangle ABD? Since quadrilaterals need four distinct points. If that's the case, then Quadrilateral(A,B,D,A) could be a triangle with points A, B, D, but with A repeated, making it a triangle. So assuming that, then the triangle ABD has angles at A, B, D.

So, in triangle ABD, the angles would be ∠BAD (∠B,A,D), ∠ABD (∠A,B,D), and ∠ADB (∠D,A,B). Wait, but the given angles are ∠ADB (which is ∠A,D,B), which is the same as ∠ADB. So, in triangle ABD, the angles are ∠BAD, ∠ABD, and ∠ADB. Their sum should be 180 degrees. However, the problem states that the sum of these four angles (including Angle(B,A,D)) plus 360 equals something? Wait, the original SumOf line is:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)),360)

This is unclear. Maybe the SumOf is adding up those four angle measures and equating to 360? Like:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 360?

If that's the case, then substituting the known values:

We know that MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) is 68 degrees.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables for each angle:

Let’s call:

∠ADB = 68° (given).

∠DBE = 3x - 15° (given).

∠DAE = 2x° (given).

∠BAD = ? (this is Angle(B,A,D), which is the same as ∠BAD).

Then, according to the SumOf equation:

68 + (3x - 15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 360 ?

Wait, but where does the 360 come into play? Wait, maybe the SumOf is actually the sum of those four angles equals 360. So:

∠ADB + ∠DBE + ∠DAE + ∠BAD = 360° ?

But that seems possible. Let me check if that makes sense.

Assuming that, then:

68 + (3x - 15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 360.

But what is ∠BAD? In triangle ABD, ∠BAD + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°. Here, ∠ABD is ∠ABD, which may relate to other angles. Wait, but ∠ABD is part of the triangle ABD. However, in the given angles, we also have ∠DBE and ∠DAE.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pentagon or some other polygon here. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Points A, B, D connected as a triangle (since Quadrilateral(A,B,D,A) is likely a triangle). Then point E is connected such that ∠DBE is formed, and ∠DAE is formed. Also, there's a triangle ABC connected to point C, with ∠ACE being y².

But perhaps focusing on the angles involving E. Let me consider that.

Starting with the angles around point A and D.

First, ∠DAE = 2x°. This is the angle at A between D and E. Also, ∠BAD is part of triangle ABD. So, if we look at point A, there's ∠BAD (from triangle ABD) and ∠DAE (from point E). Depending on how E is placed, these angles might add up to something else. For instance, if E lies somewhere such that lines AE and BE create these angles.

Similarly, at point B, we have ∠ABD (part of triangle ABD) and ∠DBE (given as 3x -15°). So, if we assume that points A, B, D, E form some configuration where E is outside or inside the triangle ABD.

Another thing to note is that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but unless specified, we don't know if E is positioned such that angles at E or other points contribute.

But going back to the main equation from the SumOf:

Assuming that the sum of ∠ADB (68°), ∠DBE (3x-15°), ∠DAE (2x°), and ∠BAD equals 360°, then:

68 + (3x -15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 360.

But we need to find ∠BAD. How?

In triangle ABD, ∠BAD + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°. We know ∠ADB is 68°, so:

∠BAD + ∠ABD + 68 = 180 => ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112°.

Now, ∠ABD is the angle at B in triangle ABD, which is adjacent to ∠DBE. If we consider that at point B, the angles ∠ABD and ∠DBE might be adjacent, forming a larger angle. Unless E is aligned in a particular way.

For example, suppose that E is located such that BE forms an extension beyond BD or something. Suppose that ∠DBE is part of a straight line or something else. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. But maybe we can relate ∠ABD with ∠DBE.

If we assume that points A, B, D, E lie in such a way that ∠ABD and ∠DBE are adjacent angles at point B, then their sum would be ∠ABE. But unless we have more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle DBE? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the entire figure, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something, but without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that ∠DAE = 2x, which is the angle at A between D and E. Also, ∠BAD is part of triangle ABD. If we consider that point E is such that AE splits ∠BAD into parts? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, considering that ∠DAE is 2x and ∠BAD is some value, and if they are adjacent angles at point A, then their sum might be related to another angle.

Wait, if you imagine point E such that line AE goes from A through D to E, but that might not make sense. Or if E is somewhere else.

Alternatively, think about triangle ADE. In triangle ADE, we have ∠DAE = 2x, and maybe other angles. But without knowing more sides or angles, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point A is 360°, but again, unless we have more information about other angles at A.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to focus on the SumOf equation. Let me write that equation again:

From the problem statement:

SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)),360) equals ...? Wait, the original wording was:

SumOf(..., 360). But maybe that's a mistake. Let me recheck the original input:

"SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)),360)"

Ah! It's possible that this is a misformatting, and the actual intention is that the sum of those four angles equals 360 degrees. So:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 360 degrees.

Therefore, plugging in the knowns:

68 + (3x -15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 360.

Which simplifies to:

68 + 3x -15 + 2x + ∠BAD = 360 → (68 -15) + 5x + ∠BAD = 360 → 53 + 5x + ∠BAD = 360 → 5x + ∠BAD = 307.

But we need another equation involving ∠BAD. Earlier, from triangle ABD, we had ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112°, as ∠ADB = 68°.

So, if we can express ∠ABD in terms of other angles, maybe?

Looking at point B, we have ∠DBE = 3x -15°. Assuming that ∠ABD and ∠DBE are adjacent angles at point B, then ∠ABD + ∠DBE = ∠ABE. But unless we have more information about ∠ABE, this might not help directly. However, if there's a triangle involving E, perhaps.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but there's also the triangle ABC mentioned. The problem says Triangle(A,B,C). So, points A, B, C form a triangle, and there's an angle ∠ACE = y². So, point C is connected to A and E via CE?

Maybe there's a relationship between triangles ABD and ABC, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe focusing on the angles involving point E.

At point E, we have angles ∠DBE and ∠DAE. If we consider triangle DBE or triangle DAE.

Wait, let's consider triangle DAE. In triangle DAE, we have ∠DAE = 2x. What about the other angles? Well, if we can find relations between them.

Alternatively, maybe considering that points A, D, E form a triangle, but without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, think about the fact that the sum of angles around point E? Not sure.

Wait, but maybe we can connect the equations we have. From earlier:

Equation 1: 5x + ∠BAD = 307.

And Equation 2: ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112.

If we can find another relation between ∠ABD and other angles.

At point B, the angle ∠ABD is part of triangle ABD, and ∠DBE is given as 3x -15. If we assume that ∠ABD and ∠DBE are supplementary or something, but that depends on the diagram.

Wait, suppose that points A, B, D, E are arranged such that E lies on the extension of BD or something. For example, if E is on the line extending from BD beyond D, then ∠DBE would be a straight line, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, if E is such that BE is a side creating a triangle with BD. Without seeing the diagram, it's challenging, but perhaps we can assume that ∠ABD and ∠DBE are adjacent, forming a larger angle. Let's assume that ∠ABD + ∠DBE = some angle, but without knowing its measure, this might not help.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, we have ∠BAE, which might be ∠BAD + ∠DAE if D is between A and E. Wait, if D is on AE, then ∠DAE would be part of ∠BAE. But if that's the case, then ∠BAE = ∠BAD + ∠DAE.

But this requires that D lies on AE. Is there any indication of that? Given that the quadrilateral is ABD A (probably a typo), maybe D is connected to E.

Alternatively, if D is a point such that AD and ED are connected, forming angle DAE.

This is getting too vague. Maybe there's another approach.

Let me recall that the problem also mentions Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E))). This suggests that these three angles are added together, possibly as part of another equation, but the question is only asking for x, so maybe this is part of another condition.

However, since the question is only about finding x, maybe we can focus on the first equation involving the sum of angles.

Earlier, we had:

5x + ∠BAD = 307.

And from triangle ABD: ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112°.

But we need another equation connecting ∠ABD with something else.

Wait, if we consider point E and the angles at point B. If ∠DBE = 3x -15°, and if ∠ABD is part of the same triangle or something, maybe ∠ABD relates to ∠DBE.

Suppose that at point B, the total angle is composed of ∠ABD and ∠DBE. If E is positioned such that BE is forming a straight line with BA, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through B, then ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180°, making them supplementary. But that's an assumption.

If that's true, then ∠ABD + (3x -15) = 180° ⇒ ∠ABD = 180 - (3x -15) = 195 - 3x.

Substituting back into Equation 2:

∠BAD + (195 - 3x) = 112 ⇒ ∠BAD = 112 - 195 + 3x = 3x -83.

Now, substitute this into Equation 1:

5x + (3x -83) = 307 ⇒ 8x -83 = 307 ⇒ 8x = 307 + 83 = 390 ⇒ x = 390 / 8 = 48.75. Hmm, but none of the answer choices are close to that. The options are 30, 34, 60, 68. So this suggests that my assumption about ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180° is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at B is different. Let me think again.

Perhaps ∠ABD is not supplementary to ∠DBE. Maybe they are part of a larger structure. For example, if E is inside triangle ABD, then ∠DBE would be part of the interior angles. But without knowing the position of E, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle DBE. In triangle DBE, we have ∠DBE = 3x -15°, and other angles?

But without knowing other angles in that triangle, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but we also have the angle ∠DAE = 2x°, which is at point A. If we consider triangle ADE, then in triangle ADE, the angles would be ∠DAE = 2x°, ∠ADE, and ∠AED. But again, without more info, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around point D. At point D, we have angles ∠ADB (68°) and maybe others depending on where E is. For example, if there's a line DE, then ∠ADC or something else. But again, not enough info.

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between ∠BAD and ∠DAE. Suppose that point E lies on the extension of AD, so that ∠DAE is part of a straight line. But that would mean ∠DAE is a straight angle, which it isn't (it's 2x). So that can't be.

Alternatively, if E is positioned such that AE is a side, and D is somewhere else.

Hmm. This seems stuck. Maybe I missed something in the initial equations.

Let me go back. The SumOf equation gives us:

68 + (3x -15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 360.

Which simplifies to:

68 -15 + 5x + ∠BAD = 360 → 53 + 5x + ∠BAD = 360 → 5x + ∠BAD = 307.

We also have from triangle ABD:

∠BAD + ∠ABD + 68 = 180 → ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112.

Now, if we can find another equation relating ∠ABD and other angles.

Looking at the other part of the problem: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E))).

This means that the sum of ∠DBE (3x -15), ∠DAE (2x), and ∠ACE (y²) is computed. But since the question is about x, maybe this sum is equal to something else, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the original instruction says:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E)))"

But the problem didn't mention that this sum equals anything. So maybe this is part of another equation, but since the question is only about x, maybe this is irrelevant? Or perhaps there's an implicit constraint?

Wait, the problem might have been cut off or missing some information. But given the current data, we have two equations:

1. 5x + ∠BAD = 307

2. ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112

But we need another equation to solve for x. Without additional info, it's impossible. Hence, perhaps I need to consider another relationship.

Wait, what about triangle ACE? The angle ∠ACE is y². But unless there's a relationship between y and x, we can't use this. However, the problem might expect us to realize that y is related to x through some other condition, but without more information, it's hard to see.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to link the angles through the triangles. For example, if points A, C, E form a triangle, then ∠ACE is part of that triangle. But again, without knowing other angles in that triangle, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or some other property. For example, if points A, B, C, E lie on a circle, but again, no info.

Wait, but maybe the sum of angles around point E? Let's think. At point E, we have several angles. For instance, ∠DBE, ∠DAE, and possibly others. If we consider that the sum of angles around E is 360°, then:

∠DBE + ∠DAE + ... = 360°, but unless we know all the angles around E, we can't proceed.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through E, but again, unknown.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, the angles are ∠CAE, ∠CEA, and ∠ACE (y²). But without knowing ∠CAE or ∠CEA, it's hard.

Wait, but ∠CAE could be related to ∠DAE if C is on a certain line. For example, if C lies on AD or AE.

But since there's a triangle ABC, point C is connected to A and B. So, if we consider triangle ABC, we have points A, B, C. And the angle ∠ACE is given as y². So, point E must be connected to C and A.

But how?

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to revisit the initial assumptions.

Let me think differently: Assume that the sum of the four angles mentioned equals 360, leading to 5x + ∠BAD = 307, and from triangle ABD, ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112. If I can express ∠ABD in terms of x, then I can solve for x.

How can I relate ∠ABD to x? Let's consider that at point B, the angle ∠ABD is adjacent to ∠DBE. If we assume that ∠ABD + ∠DBE = ∠ABE, and if ∠ABE is part of another triangle or line, but without knowing more, it's still ambiguous.

Wait, but what if ∠ABE is a right angle or something? No, that's an assumption.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through B, then ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180°, making them supplementary. Let me try that again, even though earlier it gave x=48.75 which isn't among the choices. But maybe I made a calculation error.

If ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180°, then ∠ABD = 180 - (3x -15) = 195 - 3x.

Substitute into Equation 2: ∠BAD + (195 - 3x) = 112 ⇒ ∠BAD = 112 - 195 + 3x = 3x -83.

Substitute into Equation 1: 5x + (3x -83) = 307 → 8x = 307 +83 = 390 → x = 390/8 = 48.75. As before.

This is not matching any option. So maybe this assumption is wrong.

Alternative idea: Perhaps ∠ABD is equal to ∠DBE? That is, ∠ABD = 3x -15°. Let's test this.

If ∠ABD = 3x -15°, then from Equation 2: ∠BAD + (3x -15) = 112 → ∠BAD = 112 - 3x +15 = 127 -3x.

Plug into Equation 1: 5x + (127 -3x) = 307 → 2x +127 = 307 → 2x = 180 → x = 90. Still not in options.

Not helpful.

Another possibility: Maybe the angle ∠ABD is zero, which is impossible. Or maybe it's related to other angles.

Wait, what if the sum of angles in triangle ABE? Let's assume that. Suppose we consider triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, the angles are ∠BAE, ∠ABE, and ∠AEB.

But ∠BAE could be ∠BAD + ∠DAE, if D is on AE. Let's assume that D is on AE. Then, ∠BAE = ∠BAD + ∠DAE = ∠BAD + 2x.

Also, ∠ABE would be ∠ABD + ∠DBE = ∠ABD + (3x -15°). 

Then, in triangle ABE, the sum of angles is 180°:

∠BAE + ∠ABE + ∠AEB = 180°.

But we don't know ∠AEB. However, if there's another relation involving ∠AEB, like being part of another triangle or straight line.

Alternatively, if ∠AEB is related to ∠ACE, which is y². But without knowing, it's unclear.

But let's proceed with this assumption. So:

∠BAE = ∠BAD + 2x.

∠ABE = ∠ABD + (3x -15°).

And ∠AEB = ?

But we don't have info about ∠AEB, so this might not help.

However, if we could relate ∠AEB to ∠ACE, which is y². For example, if points E, C, and some other point form a straight line, but again, no info.

Alternatively, if ∠AEB is supplementary to ∠ACE, but this is speculation.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving C and E, like triangle ACE, where ∠ACE = y². If we could relate y to x somehow.

But the problem doesn't give any direct relation between x and y. So this path seems unproductive.

Wait, but the problem asks for x, and the answer choices are given. Maybe there's a way to assume that y is an integer, or that y² is an angle that fits with other angles. But without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the three angles mentioned in the Add(...) is equal to something. Let me check.

The problem says: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E))). This is likely part of another equation, but since it's not specified, maybe it's equal to 180° or something else? If we assume that this sum equals 180°, for example.

Let's try that. So:

(3x -15) + 2x + y² = 180 → 5x -15 + y² = 180 → y² = 195 -5x.

But we don't know y, so this introduces another variable. However, if there's another equation involving y, we could solve. But since there's no other info, this might not help.

Alternatively, if the sum is equal to 90°, or some other number, but again, guessing.

Alternatively, maybe this sum is part of a triangle or something. For example, if ∠ACE is part of triangle ACE, and the other angles are part of it. But without knowing, it's hard.

This seems like a dead end. Let me think again about the initial equations.

We have two equations:

1. 5x + ∠BAD = 307

2. ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112

If I could express ∠ABD in terms of x, I could solve for x. But how?

Wait, what if ∠ABD is equal to ∠DAE? That is, ∠ABD = 2x? Let's try this assumption.

Then, from equation 2: ∠BAD + 2x = 112 → ∠BAD = 112 - 2x.

Substitute into equation 1: 5x + (112 - 2x) = 307 → 3x + 112 = 307 → 3x = 195 → x = 65. Not in the choices either.

Closest is option C: 60, but 65 is not there.

Alternatively, assume ∠ABD = ∠DAE = 2x. Same as above.

No luck.

Another idea: Maybe ∠ABD is equal to ∠DBE? So ∠ABD = 3x -15.

Then, from equation 2: ∠BAD + (3x -15) = 112 → ∠BAD = 112 -3x +15 = 127 -3x.

Substitute into equation 1: 5x + (127 -3x) = 307 → 2x + 127 = 307 → 2x = 180 → x = 90. Again, not in choices.

Hmm. This is frustrating. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the SumOf equation.

Let me re-express the SumOf statement. The original text says:

"SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)),360)" 

Maybe it's supposed to be the sum of the first four angles equals 360, and the last term is a typo. Or perhaps it's the sum of the first four angles plus 360 equals something? Like, maybe the total of those four angles plus 360 equals some value?

But without knowing what it equals, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error, and the correct equation is that the sum of those four angles equals 180°, but that would make 68 + (3x-15) + 2x + ∠BAD = 180. Let's try that:

68 + 3x -15 + 2x + ∠BAD = 180 → 53 +5x + ∠BAD = 180 → 5x + ∠BAD = 127.

With equation from triangle ABD: ∠BAD + ∠ABD = 112.

Still need to relate ∠ABD to x. Let's assume ∠ABD = 3x -15 (same as ∠DBE). Then:

∠BAD + (3x -15) = 112 → ∠BAD = 112 -3x +15 = 127 -3x.

Substitute into 5x + (127 -3x) = 127 → 2x + 127 = 127 → x = 0. Impossible.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, if ∠ABD is something else. Let's try assuming that ∠ABD = x. Then:

∠BAD + x = 112 → ∠BAD = 112 - x.

Substitute into 5x + (112 -x) = 127 → 4x +112 = 127 → 4x = 15 → x = 3.75. Not in options.

Nope.

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf equation is supposed to be the sum of the first three angles plus ∠BAD equals 360, and the last term is a typo. Let me try that.

So, MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 360.

Which is what I originally thought, leading to 5x + ∠BAD = 307.

But how to get x from here?

Maybe there's another relationship from the Add(...) part. Let me think: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E))) = ?. If this sum is equal to 180°, for example, then:

(3x -15) + 2x + y² = 180 → 5x -15 + y² = 180 → y² = 195 -5x.

But if we can relate y to x through another equation, perhaps from triangle ACE.

Assume that in triangle ACE, the angles are ∠CAE, ∠CEA, and ∠ACE = y². The sum of these angles is 180°.

But ∠CAE could be related to other angles. If C is on AB or something. Since there's a triangle ABC, maybe ∠CAE is part of that.

But without knowing, it's hard. Let's assume that ∠CAE is equal to ∠BAD, which is part of triangle ABD. Or some other relation.

Alternatively, if ∠CAE is ∠BAD + ∠DAE, similar to previous assumption. If D is on AE, then ∠CAE = ∠BAD + ∠DAE = ∠BAD + 2x.

But this is speculative. Let's proceed with this.

Then, in triangle ACE, we have:

∠CAE + ∠CEA + ∠ACE = 180°.

Assume ∠CAE = ∠BAD + 2x.

But ∠CEA is unknown. However, if ∠CEA is equal to ∠DBE, which is 3x -15°, then:

(∠BAD + 2x) + (3x -15) + y² = 180.

But from earlier, y² = 195 -5x.

Substitute:

(∠BAD + 2x) + (3x -15) + (195 -5x) = 180.

Simplify:

∠BAD + 2x +3x -15 +195 -5x = 180 → ∠BAD + (2x+3x-5x) + (-15 +195) = 180 → ∠BAD + 0x + 180 = 180 → ∠BAD = 0. Which is impossible.

Thus, this assumption is invalid.

This suggests that my assumptions are flawed. Perhaps I need to reconsider the entire approach.

Let me try to think of x as one of the given options and see which one satisfies the equations.

Option B: x = 34.

Let's plug x=34 into the equations.

First, calculate ∠DBE = 3x -15 = 3*34 -15 = 102 -15 = 87°.

∠DAE = 2x = 68°.

Now, the SumOf equation: 68 (Angle ADB) + 87 (Angle DBE) + 68 (Angle DAE) + ∠BAD = 360.

So 68 +87 +68 + ∠BAD = 360 → 223 + ∠BAD = 360 → ∠BAD = 137°.

From triangle ABD: ∠BAD + ∠ABD + 68 = 180 → 137 + ∠ABD = 112 → ∠ABD = 112 -137 = -25°. Negative angle, impossible. So x=34 is invalid.

Option A: x=30.

∠DBE = 3*30 -15 = 90 -15 = 75°.

∠DAE = 60°.

Sum: 68 +75 +60 + ∠BAD = 360 → 203 + ∠BAD = 360 → ∠BAD = 157°.

From triangle ABD: 157 + ∠ABD + 68 = 180 → ∠ABD = 180 -157 -68 = -45°. Still negative. Invalid.

Option C: x=60.

∠DBE = 3*60 -15 = 180 -15 = 165°.

∠DAE = 120°.

Sum: 68 +165 +120 + ∠BAD = 360 → 353 + ∠BAD = 360 → ∠BAD = 7°.

From triangle ABD: 7 + ∠ABD +68 = 180 → ∠ABD = 180 -7 -68 = 105°.

Now, if ∠ABD = 105°, and ∠DBE = 165°, what does that mean at point B? If these are adjacent angles, their sum would be 105 + 165 = 270°, which is greater than 180°, implying that E is positioned such that BE extends in a way that creates a reflex angle, which is possible but unlikely in standard problems. However, mathematically, it's allowed. So this might be possible.

But let's check if this leads to consistency elsewhere. Now, what about the Add(...) part? It's Add(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,E))).

So, this is 165 + 120 + y² = 285 + y². If this is equal to something, but we don't know. However, if we assume that this sum is equal to 180°, then y² = 180 - 285 = -105, which is impossible. So this suggests inconsistency.

But maybe this sum is equal to 360°? Then y² = 360 - 285 = 75. So y = sqrt(75) ≈ 8.66, which is fine, but no info on y. So it's possible.

But since the question is only about x, and this gives x=60, which is option C. But let's check if there's any other contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the Add(...) is part of another equation. For example, if this sum is equal to the third angle in some triangle, but without knowing, it's hard.

But since x=60 gives a valid ∠ABD and ∠BAD, and no immediate contradictions, it might be the intended answer. Although the negative angle when x=34 and x=30 were invalid, while x=60 gives positive angles, and x=68 (option D) would give:

x=68.

∠DBE = 3*68 -15 = 204 -15 = 189°.

∠DAE = 2*68 = 136°.

Sum: 68 + 189 + 136 + ∠BAD = 360 → 393 + ∠BAD = 360 → ∠BAD = -33°. Invalid.

So x=60 is the only valid option giving positive angles, even though the Add(...) part is unclear. Hence, the answer might be C: 60.

But earlier when I assumed ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180°, I got x=48.75, which is not an option. But since x=60 is the only valid option that gives positive angles, even though it might not satisfy all conditions, it might be the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the SumOf equation. Let me double-check.

If x=60, then:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) = 68.

MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) = 3*60 -15 = 165.

MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,E)) = 2*60 = 120.

MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,D)) = 7°.

Sum: 68 + 165 + 120 + 7 = 68 + 165 = 233; 233 + 120 = 353; 353 +7=360. Yes! It adds up to 360. So this satisfies the SumOf equation. Therefore, x=60 is correct.

Wait, this works! So earlier, when I plugged x=60, the sum of the four angles is indeed 360, which matches the SumOf equation. Thus, x=60 is the solution.

But why did the earlier assumption about ∠ABD + ∠DBE = 180° lead to x=48.75? Because that assumption was arbitrary. But in reality, with x=60, the sum of the four angles is 360, and the individual angles are valid. So this must be the correct answer.

Hence, the correct answer is C: 60.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ in the given geometric setup, we begin by analyzing the provided angular relationships and leveraging the constraints given in the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Angular Constraints**

We're given the following specific angle measurements:

- $ \angle ADB = 68^\circ $
- $ \angle DBE = 3x - 15 $
- $ \angle DAE = 2x $
- $ \angle BAD = ? $

Additionally, the problem provides a critical geometric constraint:

$$
\text{Sum of } (\angle ADB, \angle DBE, \angle DAE, \angle BAD) = 360^\circ
$$

This implies:

$$
\angle ADB + \angle DBE + \angle DAE + \angle BAD = 360^\circ
$$

Plugging in the known expressions:

$$
68 + (3x - 15) + 2x + \angle BAD = 360
$$

Simplify:

$$
68 + 3x - 15 + 2x + \angle BAD = 360 \\
(68 - 15) + 5x + \angle BAD = 360 \\
53 + 5x + \angle BAD = 360
$$

So,

$$
5x + \angle BAD = 307 \tag{1}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle ABD to Relate Angles**

In triangle $ ABD $, the sum of the internal angles is:

$$
\angle ADB + \angle ABD + \angle BAD = 180^\circ
$$

Since $ \angle ADB = 68^\circ $, we have:

$$
\angle ABD + \angle BAD = 112^\circ \tag{2}
$$

Now we have two equations involving $ \angle BAD $ and $ x $. Let’s use substitution to eliminate $ \angle BAD $.

From (1):  
$$
\angle BAD = 307 - 5x \tag{3}
$$

Substitute into (2):

$$
\angle ABD + (307 - 5x) = 112 \\
\angle ABD = 112 - (307 - 5x) = 5x - 195 \tag{4}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Consistency of All Angles**

Now we examine whether the angle values derived from these expressions are consistent with typical geometric configurations.

Recall:

- $ \angle DBE = 3x - 15 $
- $ \angle ABD = 5x - 195 $

These expressions must yield non-negative angle measures, as angles cannot be negative in standard Euclidean geometry.

Try evaluating both expressions for various values of $ x $ until we find a viable solution.

---

### **Step 4: Try Each Option for $ x $**

#### **Option A: $ x = 30 $**
- $ \angle DBE = 3(30) - 15 = 75^\circ $
- $ \angle ABD = 5(30) - 195 = -45^\circ $ ❌ Invalid

#### **Option B: $ x = 34 $**
- $ \angle DBE = 3(34) - 15 = 87^\circ $
- $ \angle ABD = 5(34) - 195 = -25^\circ $ ❌ Invalid

#### **Option C: $ x = 60 $**
- $ \angle DBE = 3(60) - 15 = 165^\circ $
- $ \angle ABD = 5(60) - 195 = 105^\circ $ ✅ Valid

Check the full sum:

$$
\angle ADB + \angle DBE + \angle DAE + \angle BAD = 68 + 165 + 120 + 7 = 360^\circ
$$

✅ All angles are non-negative and sum correctly.

---

### **Conclusion**

Only $ x = 60 $ results in consistent, non-negative angle values across all constraints, satisfying both the triangle and the overall angular sum condition.

\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
