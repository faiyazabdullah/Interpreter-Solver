====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the value of x such that lines a and b are parallel. Hmm, first I need to visualize the given points and lines based on the constraints. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

So, there are two lines, Line(a) and Line(b). Points G and H are connected to form another line, which seems to intersect both Line(a) and Line(b) at points B and A respectively. So, Line(G,H) intersects Line(a) at point B and Line(b) at point A. Also, points G and H lie on Line(G,H), which makes sense. 

Then there are other points mentioned: D, E, F, C. Point D lies on Line(a), as does point B and F. Similarly, point E lies on Line(b), along with A and C. 

Now, angles are involved here. The measure of angle FBA is given as 4x + 11 degrees, and the measure of angle AAE (wait, angle at A between A and E? Wait, the notation might be important here. Angle(A,A,E) would mean the angle at point A formed by points A, A, E? Wait, but two points can't form an angle unless it's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be angle EAA? Or maybe it's angle at A between points E and something else? Wait, the original says MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,E)). That would imply vertex at A, with segments from A to A and A to E. But since a segment can't have the same endpoint twice, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's Angle(E,A,A)? Which would make more sense. Because angle at A between E and another point. Wait, the original statement is Angle(A,A,E). Maybe that's a typo for Angle(E,A,F) or similar? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A), Add(Mul(4,x),11)) and MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,E), Add(Mul(8,x),1)). So angle FBA is measured as 4x+11, and angle AAE is measured as 8x+1. Then their sum equals 180 degrees. 

But angle AAE... If the angle is at point A, then the angle would be between points A, A, E. Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have two endpoints at the same point. So maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps it should be angle EAB? Or angle EAA? Wait, but angle EAA would still be undefined. Alternatively, maybe the second angle is angle EAB? Let me think about the diagram.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Since Line(a) and Line(b) are cut by Line(GH), creating points B and A. So GH is a transversal crossing Line(a) at B and Line(b) at A. Then points D, F are on Line(a); E and C are on Line(b). So maybe angle FBA is at point B, between F and A. Wait, F is on Line(a), so BF is part of Line(a). And BA is part of Line(b)? Wait, no. Wait, BA connects point B (on Line(a)) to point A (on Line(b))? Wait, but Line(a) and Line(b) are being crossed by Line(GH). So if Line(a) has points D, B, F, then Line(a) goes through D, B, F. Similarly, Line(b) has points E, A, C.

So, considering that, angle FBA would be the angle at point B between points F, B, A. So that's angle FBA. And angle AAE would be... if it's angle at A between points A, A, E, which is impossible. Therefore, likely a typo. Maybe it's angle EAB? So angle at A between E and B? That would make sense. Let me assume that. So angle EAB is 8x + 1 degrees. Then, the sum of angle FBA and angle EAB is 180 degrees. If that's the case, then those two angles would be supplementary.

If lines a and b are parallel, then the transversal GH creates some corresponding angles or consecutive interior angles. Wait, but the angles we're looking at—angle FBA and angle EAB—are they related?

Alternatively, maybe these angles are consecutive interior angles? If lines a and b are parallel, then consecutive interior angles are supplementary. But let's see:

Assuming that Line(a) and Line(b) are parallel, then when a transversal crosses them, certain angle relationships hold. However, the angles mentioned here are angle FBA (at point B) and angle EAB (at point A). Let me consider the positions.

Since Line(a) contains points D, B, F, and Line(b) contains points E, A, C. The transversal is Line(GH), which passes through points G and H, intersecting Line(a) at B and Line(b) at A. So, points G and H are on the transversal. So, the transversal cuts across lines a and b at points B and A respectively.

So, angle FBA is at point B on Line(a), between F (on Line(a)) and A (which is on Line(b)). So that angle is outside the parallel lines, perhaps. Whereas angle EAB is at point A on Line(b), between E (on Line(b)) and B (on Line(a)). So, these two angles may be consecutive interior angles? Wait, but consecutive interior angles are on the same side of the transversal. Let me recall: when two lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are the ones inside the two lines, on the same side. If lines a and b are parallel, then consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

But in this case, angle FBA is on one side of the transversal, and angle EAB is on the other side? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let me imagine lines a and b being horizontal, with Line(GH) as a transversal crossing them at B and A. Suppose Line(a) is horizontal, going left to right, with points D, B, F. Line(b) is also horizontal, with points E, A, C. The transversal GH could be slanting upwards from B to A. Then angle FBA would be at point B, between F (to the left on Line(a)) and A (upwards to the transversal). So that angle is between Line(a) and the transversal. Similarly, angle EAB would be at point A, between E (left on Line(b)) and B (downwards to the transversal). So these two angles are on different sides of the transversal. Wait, maybe they are alternate interior angles? No, because alternate interior angles would be on opposite sides of the transversal. Wait, if lines a and b are parallel, then alternate interior angles are equal. But if the sum of angle FBA and angle EAB is 180 degrees, then they would be supplementary. That suggests that they are consecutive interior angles. But consecutive interior angles are only supplementary if the lines are parallel. Wait, yes! So if lines a and b are parallel, then consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So, if angle FBA and angle EAB are consecutive interior angles, then their sum is 180 degrees. 

Therefore, according to the given condition, their measures add up to 180 degrees. So we can set up the equation:

Measure of angle FBA + Measure of angle EAB = 180°

Given that Measure of angle FBA = 4x + 11°, and Measure of angle EAB = 8x + 1°. So:

(4x + 11) + (8x + 1) = 180  
Combine like terms: 12x + 12 = 180  
Subtract 12 from both sides: 12x = 168  
Divide by 12: x = 14  

Wait, that gives x=14. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 14. So that would be the answer. But let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't mix up the angles.

First, confirming that angle FBA and angle EAB are consecutive interior angles. Consecutive interior angles are the pair of angles on the same side of the transversal, inside the two lines. In this case, if the transversal is GH, then at point B on Line(a), the angle between Line(a) and GH is angle ABF (assuming F is on Line(a)), and at point A on Line(b), the angle between Line(b) and GH would be angle BAG (if G is on the other side). Wait, maybe I got the angles wrong.

Wait, let me clarify the exact positions. The transversal is Line(GH), which intersects Line(a) at B and Line(b) at A. So, the transversal goes from G through B to H, and also through A? Wait, no. Wait, Line(GH) is a single line passing through points G and H. It intersects Line(a) at B and Line(b) at A. So the order of points on Line(GH) would be G---B----A---H? Or maybe G---A---B---H? Depending on the direction. But regardless, the key is that the transversal crosses Line(a) at B and Line(b) at A.

So, angle FBA is at point B, between F (on Line(a)) and A (on Line(b)). So that's the angle between Line(a) and the transversal GH at point B. On the other hand, angle EAB is at point A, between E (on Line(b)) and B (on Line(a)). That's the angle between Line(b) and the transversal GH at point A. These two angles are on the same side of the transversal, meaning they are consecutive interior angles. Hence, if lines a and b are parallel, these angles should be supplementary. Thus, adding them together gives 180 degrees. Therefore, solving (4x + 11) + (8x + 1) = 180 leads to x=14, which corresponds to answer choice B.

But wait, the problem states that the lines a and b are to be made parallel, and the given condition is that the sum of those two angles is 180. Therefore, setting up the equation allows us to solve for x. Therefore, x=14 is the solution. So the answer should be B. But let me check once more for possible errors in angle identification.

Another possibility: if the angles were alternate interior angles, then they would be equal. But the problem states their sum is 180, so that would not fit. So my previous conclusion stands. Therefore, x=14. Answer choice B is 14. So Final Answer: B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ such that lines $ a \parallel b $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying the **consecutive interior angles theorem**.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration

- Lines $ a $ and $ b $ are intersected by a transversal $ GH $, forming intersection points:
  - $ B $: Intersection of $ a $ and $ GH $
  - $ A $: Intersection of $ b $ and $ GH $

- Additional points:
  - $ F $ and $ D $ lie on line $ a $
  - $ E $ and $ C $ lie on line $ b $
- Angles defined:
  - $ \angle FBA = 4x + 11^\circ $
  - $ \angle EAB = 8x + 1^\circ $
  - Given: $ \angle FBA + \angle EAB = 180^\circ $

---

### Step 2: Applying the Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem

When two lines are cut by a transversal, **consecutive interior angles** are **supplementary** if the lines are parallel. This means:

$$
\angle FBA + \angle EAB = 180^\circ
$$

This confirms that the configuration implies $ a \parallel b $, and thus the equality holds.

---

### Step 3: Solving the Equation

We substitute the expressions for the angles into the equation:

$$
(4x + 11) + (8x + 1) = 180
$$

$$
12x + 12 = 180
$$

$$
12x = 168
$$

$$
x = 14
$$

---

### Step 4: Selecting the Correct Answer

The computed value of $ x $ is **14**, which matches **Answer Choice B**.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{B}
