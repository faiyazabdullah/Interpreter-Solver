MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points on a circle, some lines, angles, and certain conditions. The question is asking for the measure of angle 3 (which is labeled as x) given that angle 2 is twice x and angle 1 is 90 degrees. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's note down the key information:

- Points F, G, H, J lie on Circle A. Also, F, H are endpoints of a diameter since Line(F,H) is stated as a diameter of Circle A. Similarly, Line(G,J) is also a diameter of the same circle. Wait, but how can two different diameters exist? Unless they are intersecting at the center?

Wait, the problem says both Line(F,H) and Line(G,J) are diameters of Circle A. That means both lines pass through the center of the circle. Since a diameter is a line segment passing through the center, so both FH and GJ are diameters. Therefore, their intersection point must be the center of the circle. But the problem mentions Point A. Wait, the points mentioned include Point A. Wait, looking back: Points A, B, F, G, H, J are mentioned. Also, Point LIES ON LINE(F,H): Points F, B, A, H. Wait, Line(F,H) has points F, B, A, H lying on it. So, Line(F,H) is a straight line containing points F, B, A, H. Since F and H are endpoints of a diameter, then the center of the circle must be the midpoint of FH. Also, since A lies on this line, maybe A is the center? Because if A is on the diameter FH, then perhaps A is the center. Wait, but the problem says Point(A) is part of the setup, but I need to check if A is the center.

Wait, the circle is named Circle(A). In geometry, when a circle is named with a single letter like Circle(A), that usually denotes that A is the center. So, Circle(A) has center at point A. Therefore, the center of the circle is point A. Then, since Line(F,H) is a diameter of the circle, which passes through the center. So, since the center is A, then A must lie on the line FH. Which matches the constraint that Point(A) lies on Line(F,H). So that makes sense. Therefore, FH is a diameter with center at A. Similarly, Line(G,J) is another diameter. So, GJ is another diameter, meaning that G and J are endpoints of another diameter, and since the center is A, then A must lie on line GJ as well. However, looking at the constraints, there's a PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(G,J))? Wait, no. Let me check again:

The constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(G,J)) — so point B lies on line GJ. Also, PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(G,J)) — so point A lies on line GJ. So, both GJ and FH are diameters passing through point A, the center. Therefore, lines FH and GJ intersect at the center A.

So, the diagram includes two diameters FH and GJ intersecting at the center A. Now, considering triangle GHJ. The problem refers to Triangle(G,H,J). So, triangle formed by points G, H, J.

Now, angles 1, 2, 3. The problem states that Angle(1) is a right angle (90 degrees), Angle(2) is equal to 2x, Angle(3) is equal to x. And the sum of these three angles is asked. Wait, but the question is to find m∠3, which is x, given that ∠1 is 90°, ∠2 is 2x, and ∠3 is x. Also, there's an equation: Add(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))). So, adding up all three angles.

But wait, in a triangle, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. However, here, the problem might refer to angles inside the triangle or something else. Wait, but the problem says "Angle(1)", "Angle(2)", "Angle(3)" — perhaps they are the three angles of triangle GHJ?

Let me think. If Triangle(G,H,J) is considered, then its angles would be at each vertex. Let's denote them as follows:

At point G: angle between segments HG and GJ.

At point H: angle between segments GH and HJ.

At point J: angle between segments GJ and JH.

But the problem mentions Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3). Maybe they correspond to specific angles. However, without more details, perhaps we need to consider that Angle(1) is a right angle. Given that Angle(1) is a right angle (90°), and the other two angles are 2x and x. So, adding them up: 90 + 2x + x = 180 → 3x = 90 → x=30. Hence, m∠3 is 30°, so answer A. But wait, why is Angle(1) the right angle?

Alternatively, maybe Angle(1) is referring to some other angle, not necessarily part of triangle GHJ. But the problem says "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(1)),MeasureOf(Angle(2)),MeasureOf(Angle(3)))". So, the sum of those three angles equals... Well, the problem says "Find m∠3", given that ∠1 is 90°, ∠2 is 2x, ∠3 is x. So, regardless of the context, the sum of the three angles is 90 + 2x + x = 180. So solving gives x=30. Therefore, answer A.

But wait, could there be more to it? For example, maybe the angles aren't part of a triangle? Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says: "Triangle(G,H,J)" and "Angle(1)", "Angle(2)", "Angle(3)". So likely, these angles are the three angles of triangle GHJ. But if Angle(1) is a right angle, then the triangle is right-angled. Then the other two angles sum to 90°, and if ∠2 is twice ∠3, then ∠3 = 30°, ∠2 = 60°, making total 90+60+30=180. So yes, that works. Therefore, m∠3 is 30°, which is option A.

But let me make sure that Angle(1) is indeed the right angle in triangle GHJ. How do we know that?

Looking back at the constraints: IsDiameterOf(Line(F,H),Circle(A)) and IsDiameterOf(Line(G,J),Circle(A)). So lines FH and GJ are diameters. Since they are diameters, they intersect at the center A. So, the lines FH and GJ cross at A, forming vertical angles. Now, points G, H, J are on the circle. Let me visualize this.

Since FH is a diameter, and GJ is another diameter. So, points F and H are endpoints of one diameter; G and J are endpoints of another. So, the four points F, H, G, J lie on the circle, with FH and GJ being diameters. So, the intersection point A is the center.

Then, triangle GHJ connects points G, H, J. Let me imagine the positions. Suppose FH is horizontal, with F on the left, H on the right, and A at the center. GJ is another diameter, so suppose it's vertical, with G at top, J at bottom. Then, connecting G, H, J forms a triangle. Let me see.

But depending on the position of G and J, triangle GHJ could vary. However, since both FH and GJ are diameters, then lines FH and GJ intersect at A. So, the triangle GHJ would have vertices at G, H, J. Let me consider coordinates for clarity.

Let’s assign coordinates. Let me assume the circle has center at A(0,0), radius r. Let’s take FH as the horizontal diameter: F(-r, 0), H(r, 0). Then GJ is another diameter, let's say vertical: G(0, r), J(0, -r). Then, triangle GHJ would connect points G(0,r), H(r,0), J(0,-r). What's the shape of triangle GHJ?

Calculating the sides:

GH: distance between (0,r) and (r,0): sqrt[(r)^2 + (-r)^2] = sqrt(2r²) = r√2.

HJ: distance between (r,0) and (0,-r): sqrt[(-r)^2 + (-r)^2] = r√2.

GJ: distance between (0,r) and (0,-r): 2r.

Therefore, triangle GHJ has two sides of length r√2 and one side of length 2r. So, it's an isoceles triangle with base 2r and equal sides r√2. Let's compute the angles.

Using the Law of Cosines for angle at H: between GH and HJ.

Wait, but maybe easier to compute using coordinates. Alternatively, since the triangle has points G(0,r), H(r,0), J(0,-r).

Let me compute vectors for the angles. For example, angle at H: between HG and HJ.

Vector HG goes from H(r,0) to G(0,r): (-r, r)

Vector HJ goes from H(r,0) to J(0,-r): (-r, -r)

Compute the angle between these vectors.

Dot product: (-r)(-r) + (r)(-r) = r² - r² = 0. Oh! The dot product is zero, so the angle at H is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. Thus, angle at H is 90°, which is Angle(1). Then the other two angles are at G and J.

In a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90°, and are complementary. Let’s call angle at G as angle 2 and angle at J as angle 3. According to the problem statement, angle 2 is 2x and angle 3 is x. Therefore, angle2 + angle3 = 90°, so 2x + x = 90° → 3x = 90° → x = 30°, hence angle3 is 30°, which is answer A.

This seems consistent. Therefore, the measure of angle 3 is 30°, so the answer is A.

But let me confirm once more. Since the triangle is right-angled at H, which corresponds to Angle(1)=90°, then the other two angles are angle at G and angle at J. Depending on how the problem labels them, but the problem says Angle(2) and Angle(3). Assuming that angle2 is at G and angle3 at J, or vice versa. Either way, their measures would be 60° and 30°, respectively. Since angle2 is twice angle3, then angle3 is 30°, which is option A.

Yes, this seems solid. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
