MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x, which is the length of line BC in a right triangle ABC. The problem gives me some constraints. Let me go through them step by step.

First, the triangle is a right triangle, and it's specified that angle at B is a right angle. Wait, because they mentioned RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which means the right angle is at point B. So triangle ABC is right-angled at B. That makes sense. Then, the sides AB, BC, and AC are the sides of the triangle. 

They also mention that line AC is the hypotenuse because it says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). Since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse should be opposite the right angle, so that would be AC. Therefore, AC is the hypotenuse. 

Now, the lengths given are AB = 13 units, AC = 22 units, and BC is x, which we need to find. Also, since it's a right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem applies here. 

So according to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, hypotenuse is AC, so:

AC² = AB² + BC²

Plugging in the known values:

22² = 13² + x²

Let me compute those squares. 

22 squared is 484. 13 squared is 169. So substituting:

484 = 169 + x²

To solve for x², subtract 169 from both sides:

x² = 484 - 169

Calculating that, 484 minus 169. Let me do the subtraction. 

484 - 100 is 384, then subtract another 69: 384 - 69 = 315. So x² = 315. Therefore, x is the square root of 315. 

But wait, can I simplify √315? Let me check. 315 factors into... Well, 315 divided by 5 is 63. So 315 = 5 * 63 = 5 * 9 * 7. So sqrt(5*9*7) = 3*sqrt(35). Because sqrt(9) is 3, so that simplifies to 3√35. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 3√35. So that would be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, confirming the right angle is at B. Yes, because the angle (A,B,C) is the right angle. So AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Given AB=13, AC=22, so BC^2 = AC^2 - AB^2 = 22² -13². Which is indeed 484 -169 = 315. So x = sqrt(315) = sqrt(9*35) = 3√35. Yep, that matches option C. 

Wait, but let me check the answer choices again. The options are A. 11, B. 11√2, C. 3√35, D. √653. So yes, option C is 3√35, which is the simplified form of √315. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
