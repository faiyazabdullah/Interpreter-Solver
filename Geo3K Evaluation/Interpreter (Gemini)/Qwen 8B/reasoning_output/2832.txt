MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 3 here. Let me start by going through the given information step by step. 

First, there are several points mentioned: A, B, C, D. There are triangles formed between these points: Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(B,C,D), and Triangle(A,B,D). Also, lines connecting various pairs: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,C), Line(B,D), Line(A,D). Then there are angles mentioned like Angle(A), which I think refers to angle at point A? Wait, maybe not. The notation might be important here. For example, Angle(A) could be ambiguous. But looking further, there's Angle(A,B,C), which would be the angle at point B between points A, B, C. Similarly, Angle(C,B,D) is the angle at point B between points C, B, D. So that makes sense. 

Also, some equalities are given:

- Measure of Angle(A) is 42 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(A,B,C) (which is angle at B in triangle ABC) is 72 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(C,B,D) (angle at B in triangle CBD) is 38 degrees.
- Sum of measures of Angle(A), Angle(A,B,C), and Angle(3) equals 180 degrees. So that's 42 + 72 + measure(angle3) = 180. Wait, but that seems straightforward. Let me check that again. 

Wait, the fourth equality says: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))), 180). So adding those three gives 180. Therefore, solving for angle3 would be 180 - 42 -72 = 66. That would make angle3 equal to 66 degrees. But wait, that would directly give us the answer as option C. However, maybe there's more to it because sometimes diagrams can have overlapping angles or other constraints. Let me verify if there are other conditions that affect this.

But before jumping to conclusions, let me check if there are any dependencies or other relationships. For instance, there are also other angles mentioned: Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3), Angle(D). And another equation involving sum of Angle(1), Angle(2), and Angle(D) equals 180. Also, there's an equation that MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 180 minus MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)). Since Angle(A,B,C) is 72 degrees, then Angle(1) would be 180 -72=108 degrees. 

But how does that relate to angle3? Maybe there are other triangles or configurations we need to consider. Let me visualize the diagram based on the points and lines. 

Points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, AC, BD, AD. So line AD connects A and D. Point B lies on line AD? Wait, no. Wait, the constraints include PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,D))? Wait, the given constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(A,D)): So point B lies on line AD. 

Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(A,B)): So point D lies on line AB. 

And PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(B,D)): So point A lies on line BD. 

Wait, so let me parse that. If point B lies on line AD, then line AD passes through B. Similarly, point D lies on line AB, meaning that line AB contains D. And point A lies on line BD, meaning line BD contains A. 

So putting this together: 

Line AD has points A, B, D in sequence? Because if D is on AB, then AB is extended beyond B to D? Or maybe D is between A and B? Wait, since D lies on line AB, then depending on direction. Let me think. 

If D is on line AB, then either D is between A and B, or outside. Similarly, since B lies on line AD, which includes points A, D, so line AD goes through B. So if D is on AB, then line AD is the same as line AB. Wait, but line AD is defined as connecting A and D, and line AB connects A and B. So if D lies on line AB, then line AD is the same as line AB. Hence, points A, B, D are colinear. 

So points A, B, D are colinear. So line AB is extended to point D. Therefore, the order of points on line AB could be A---B---D, or D---A---B, but since B lies on line AD (from the constraint PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,D))), then B is somewhere along line AD. 

Additionally, there's line BD, which connects points B and D. But since A lies on line BD (from PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,D))), so point A is on line BD. Which means that points B, D, and A are colinear, which aligns with the previous conclusion. 

Therefore, points A, B, D are colinear. So triangle ABD is degenerate? Wait, but there's also triangle ABD mentioned. Wait, triangle(A,B,D) exists. But if A, B, D are colinear, then triangle ABD would actually be a straight line, making it impossible to form a triangle. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Unless the points are arranged such that they are not colinear. Wait, perhaps my understanding is wrong. 

Let me re-examine the constraints. 

The constraints state:

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,D)): So point B lies on line AD.

PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)): So point D lies on line AB.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,D)): So point A lies on line BD.

So combining these, points A, B, D are colinear. Because if D is on AB, then line AB includes D. Then line AD is the same as line AB, and B lies on line AD (so B is on line AB). Also, A lies on line BD, which is the same as line AB. So all three points are on the same line. Thus, triangle ABD cannot exist unless the points are not distinct, but the problem mentions Triangle(A,B,D). This suggests that there's a contradiction here, unless there's something wrong in my interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are considered as infinite lines, so even though points are colinear, the triangle still exists? No, a triangle requires three non-colinear points. So this seems conflicting. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe the points aren't colinear. Let me re-express the constraints. 

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,D)): So B is on line AD. 

PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)): So D is on line AB. 

Thus, if D is on line AB, then line AD is the same as line AB. Hence, B being on line AD implies that B is on line AB. Which is always true since B is on AB. Wait, but then D is on line AB. So points A, B, D are all on line AB. Therefore, they are colinear. Hence, triangle ABD is degenerate. 

This seems problematic. How can there be a triangle ABD if the points are colinear? Perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the constraints. Alternatively, maybe the line BD isn't the same as AB? Wait, but according to PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,D)), point A lies on line BD. So line BD passes through A. But since D is on line AB, then line BD is line AB. So again, leading to all three points being colinear. 

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me check again. 

Another possibility: Maybe the points are not in the order I thought. Suppose that D is not between A and B, but extending in the opposite direction. For example, suppose that line AB extends beyond A to D. Then D is on line AB extended beyond A, so that line AD would pass through B? Wait, no. If D is on line AB extended beyond A, then line AD would be the same as line AB. So B is on line AD, which is possible. But then, A lies on line BD. If D is on AB extended beyond A, then line BD would connect B to D, passing through A. So yes, point A would lie on line BD. 

In this case, the points are arranged as D---A---B on line AB. So A is between D and B. Then, triangle ABD would have points A, B, D colinear. Still, forming a degenerate triangle. So how can there be a triangle ABD? 

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the points are connected. Maybe the lines are not just the segments but the entire lines. But regardless, the existence of triangle ABD implies that the points are not colinear. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

Alternatively, maybe the constraints don't imply that all three points are colinear. Let me check each condition again:

- Point B lies on line AD: So line AD passes through B. 

- Point D lies on line AB: So line AB passes through D. 

Therefore, line AD and line AB are the same line. Therefore, points A, B, D are colinear. 

Therefore, triangle ABD is degenerate. But the problem states that there is a triangle ABD. So this seems contradictory. 

Wait, but maybe the problem allows for degenerate triangles? In that case, angle measures could be zero or undefined. However, the problem gives specific angle measures, so this must not be the case. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the line AD is not the same as line AB. How? If point D is not on line AB. Wait, but the constraint says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)), which means D lies on line AB. So that would force line AD to be line AB. 

Is there another way to interpret the constraints? Maybe the lines are not the same as the segments. For example, Line(A,B) is the infinite line passing through A and B, while segment AB is the finite part. So if D lies on Line(A,B), then it's on the infinite line. But if B lies on Line(A,D), then D is on the line through A and B. So again, points A, B, D are colinear. 

This seems unavoidable. Therefore, the problem may have a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the triangles are not referring to the segments but to the lines? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles are not degenerate, implying that the points are not colinear. Therefore, there's inconsistency in the constraints. However, since the problem provides the given data, I need to work with it. 

Assuming that despite the collinearity, the angles are defined somehow. For example, if points A, B, D are colinear, then angle at B between A-B-D would be 180 degrees. But in the given data, Angle(A,B,C) is 72 degrees, and Angle(C,B,D) is 38 degrees. So angle at B between C-B-D is 38 degrees. So that suggests that point C is not on line BD. 

Wait, but if points A, B, D are colinear, then line BD is the same as line AB. So point C is not on line BD. Therefore, triangle BCD exists. 

So maybe the diagram looks like this: Points A and D are on a line (AD), with B between them (assuming D is on AB extended beyond B). Wait, earlier I thought D was on AB, but if B is on line AD, then depending on where D is. 

Let me try to sketch mentally:

Imagine line AD. On this line, point B is located. Also, point D is on line AB. So if D is on line AB, then line AB is the same as line AD. So D is a point on line AB. Let me assume that the points are ordered as follows: A --- B --- D, so that D is on AB extended beyond B. 

Then, line BD is the same as line AB. So point C is somewhere else, not on this line. 

Now, Triangle(A,B,C): points A, B, C form a triangle. Triangle(B,C,D): points B, C, D form a triangle. And Triangle(A,B,D): which would be a degenerate triangle if A, B, D are colinear. But the problem states that Triangle(A,B,D) exists, so maybe there's an error here. 

But given that the problem includes all these constraints, maybe I should proceed without worrying about the degeneracy and focus on the angles. 

Back to the original equations. We had:

Sum of MeasureOf(Angle(A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) + MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 180. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) is 42°, MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 72°, so 42 + 72 + x = 180 → x = 180 - 42 -72 = 66°. So angle3 would be 66°, which corresponds to option C. 

However, the presence of other angles and constraints might suggest that there's more to it. Let me check the other equations. 

There's another equation: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(D))), 180). 

Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Sub(180, MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)))) → Angle(1) = 180 - 72 = 108°. 

But what are Angle(1), Angle(2), and Angle(D)? The problem mentions Angle(D), which likely refers to the angle at point D. 

But without knowing their exact definitions, it's hard to tell. However, since the question asks only for angle3, and the first equation gives angle3 directly as 66°, which is option C, maybe that's the answer. 

But why include other constraints? Perhaps there's a dependency I'm missing. For example, maybe angle3 is related to other angles via triangle properties. 

Let me think about the triangle involving angle3. From the initial constraints, angle3 is part of the sum with angle(A) and angle(A,B,C). But angle(A) is 42°, and angle(A,B,C) is 72°, so angle3 is 66°. 

But angle3 is probably an angle in one of the triangles. For instance, if angle3 is part of triangle ABD, but since ABD is degenerate, that might not make sense. Alternatively, angle3 could be in triangle ACD or something else. 

Alternatively, angle3 could be an external angle or something. Wait, but without knowing exactly which triangle or configuration angle3 refers to, it's challenging. But the problem defines angle3 as part of the sum with angle(A) and angle(A,B,C). 

Since the sum is 180°, and the two known angles are 42° and 72°, subtracting gives 66°, which is option C. Therefore, even without considering other constraints, this calculation gives 66°, which is option C. 

But I need to ensure that there's no conflict elsewhere. For example, if angle3 is part of another triangle where other constraints apply. Let me see. 

Suppose angle3 is an angle in triangle ABC or another triangle. Wait, angle(A,B,C) is already given as 72°, which is angle at B. Angle(A) is 42°, which could be angle at A in some triangle. 

Alternatively, angle(A) might refer to angle at A in triangle ABD, but since it's degenerate, that might not hold. 

Alternatively, angle(A) could be an angle in another triangle. For example, if angle(A) is part of triangle ABD, but since it's degenerate, that angle would be 0°, which contradicts the given value of 42°. Therefore, this suggests that angle(A) is not part of triangle ABD. 

Therefore, angle(A) must be part of another triangle, like triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at A is 42°, angle at B is 72°, so the third angle at C would be 180 - 42 -72 = 66°. Wait, that would be angle at C in triangle ABC. But the problem mentions angle(3). Is angle(3) the angle at C? 

But the problem didn't specify which angle is angle(3). It just says "Angle(3)" in the sum. However, in the given constraints, angle(3) is part of the sum with angle(A) and angle(A,B,C). So if angle3 is the third angle in triangle ABC, then it would be 66°, which matches our calculation. 

But then, why is there mention of other angles like Angle(1), Angle(2), etc.? Maybe angle3 is part of another triangle or configuration. But given the direct calculation from the sum, it's 66°, which is option C. 

Therefore, I think the answer is C. 66°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 3$, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and algebraic relationships.

---

### Step 1: Understand Given Information

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) = 42^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle (A,B,C)) = 72^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle (C,B,D)) = 38^\circ $
- $ \text{SumOf}(\angle A, \angle (A,B,C), \angle 3) = 180^\circ $

From this, we can express the relationship:

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle A) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle (A,B,C)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
42^\circ + 72^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = 180^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $\angle 3$

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = 180^\circ - 42^\circ - 72^\circ = 66^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Confirm Consistency with Other Constraints

While additional constraints involving $\angle 1$, $\angle 2$, and $\angle D$ are present, they do **not** impact the computation of $\angle 3$, as the key relation is explicitly stated:

$$
\text{SumOf}(\angle A, \angle (A,B,C), \angle 3) = 180^\circ
$$

Hence, $\angle 3$ is directly determined by the above equation.

---

### Final Conclusion

Based on the given constraints and the derived formula, the measure of $\angle 3$ is:

$$
\boxed{66}
$$

---
