MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So we have a triangle FHK with points F, H, K. There's also points G and J. The lines FH, HK, and FK are sides of the triangle. Then there's line GJ which is parallel to line FK. Also, some lengths are given in terms of x. 

First, let me list down all the given information:

- Triangle FHK has sides FH = 21, HK = 7. So FH is 21 units long, and HK is 7 units. 
- Point G lies on line FH. So G is somewhere along the line connecting F and H.
- Point J lies on line HK. So J is somewhere along the line connecting H and K.
- Line GJ is parallel to line FK. That means the slope of GJ is equal to the slope of FK, but since they're lines in geometry, maybe we can use similar triangles here?
- The length of GH is x + 3.5, and HJ is x - 8.5. Wait, GH would be part of the segment FH? Because G is on FH. Let me think. If G is on FH, then FG + GH = FH. But FH is 21. Similarly, HJ is part of HK. Since HK is 7, then HJ + JK = HK. But I don't know JK yet. However, maybe using ratios?

Also, there's another condition: the ratio of GH to FH equals the ratio of HJ to HK. Wait, the problem says:

Equals(RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(G,H)),LengthOf(Line(F,H))), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(H,J)),LengthOf(Line(H,K))))

So that means (GH / FH) = (HJ / HK). Let me write that as equations.

Let me denote GH = x + 3.5, and FH = 21. So GH/FH = (x + 3.5)/21.

Similarly, HJ = x - 8.5, and HK = 7. Therefore, HJ/HK = (x - 8.5)/7.

Since these two ratios are equal, set them equal:

(x + 3.5)/21 = (x - 8.5)/7

Now solve for x. Let me do that.

Multiply both sides by 21 to eliminate denominators:

x + 3.5 = 3*(x - 8.5)

Expand right side: 3x - 25.5

So equation becomes:

x + 3.5 = 3x - 25.5

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

x - 3x = -25.5 - 3.5

-2x = -29

Divide both sides by -2:

x = (-29)/(-2) = 14.5

Wait, so x is 14.5? Let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify the calculation again.

Original equation:

(x + 3.5)/21 = (x - 8.5)/7

Cross-multiplying gives 7(x + 3.5) = 21(x - 8.5)

Divide both sides by 7: x + 3.5 = 3(x - 8.5)

Yes, same as before. Then expanding:

x + 3.5 = 3x - 25.5

Then moving terms:

3.5 + 25.5 = 3x - x → 29 = 2x → x = 14.5. Yes, same result.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 14.5. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure that there isn't something else I missed. For example, does the fact that GJ is parallel to FK affect anything here? Maybe I need to confirm that the ratios are indeed correct based on the parallel lines.

Because if lines GJ and FK are parallel, then perhaps triangles involved are similar. Let me consider that. 

Since G is on FH and J is on HK, and GJ || FK. Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point H at origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then since FH is 21 units long, and H is at (0,0), suppose F is at (21, 0). Wait, but then K is connected to H. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe coordinate system setup can help.

Alternatively, since FH is 21, and HK is 7. Let me assume coordinates:

Let’s take H at (0, 0). Let me set up coordinates such that F is at (21, 0), since FH is 21. Then K is connected to H. Let me assume that HK is along y-axis? Or some direction. Wait, but without knowing angles, it might complicate. However, since we have G on FH and J on HK, and GJ parallel to FK. 

But maybe instead of coordinates, using vectors or similar triangles.

Since GJ || FK, then the vector GJ is proportional to vector FK. But since G is on FH and J is on HK, maybe we can express positions parametrically.

Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles. Since GJ || FK, the triangles formed may be similar. Let me see.

If I imagine triangle FHK. Points G on FH, J on HK. And GJ || FK. So by the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side. Wait, but here the line GJ is parallel to FK, but FK is a side of the triangle. Wait, but GJ connects a point on FH and a point on HK. So maybe applying Thales’ theorem here.

Wait, Thales’ theorem states that if a line is drawn through the midpoint of one side of a triangle and parallel to another side, then it will divide the third side into two equal parts. But here, the situation is different. However, the general idea is that if a line intersects two sides of a triangle and is parallel to the third side, then it divides those sides proportionally.

Wait, but in our case, the line GJ is parallel to FK. Let me visualize triangle FHK. The line GJ connects G on FH and J on HK, and is parallel to FK. So according to the converse of Thales’ theorem, the ratio of the segments on FH and HK should be equal. Which is exactly what the problem states: GH / FH = HJ / HK. Hence, the given condition is already encapsulated in the equality of those ratios. Therefore, solving that equation gives us x. So my earlier approach was correct. Thus, solving (x+3.5)/21 = (x-8.5)/7 leads to x=14.5, which is option C.

Therefore, the answer should be C, 14.5. Let me check if substituting x=14.5 satisfies the original conditions.

Calculating GH: x + 3.5 = 14.5 + 3.5 = 18. Then FH is 21, so GH/FH = 18/21 = 6/7.

HJ: x - 8.5 = 14.5 - 8.5 = 6. Then HJ/HK = 6/7. So yes, the ratios are equal. Therefore, the condition holds. Also, since GJ || FK, which is ensured by the ratios being equal, so everything checks out.

Thus, the correct answer is C, 14.5.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the key geometric relationships provided in the question:

---

### **Given Geometric Constraints**

We are working with triangle $ \triangle FHK $, with the following knowns:
- $ FH = 21 $
- $ HK = 7 $

Points $ G $ and $ J $ lie on lines $ FH $ and $ HK $ respectively, and line $ GJ $ is **parallel** to line $ FK $. Additionally:
- $ GH = x + 3.5 $
- $ HJ = x - 8.5 $

The critical constraint is the **proportionality** between the segments due to the parallelism of $ GJ \parallel FK $, which implies:
$$
\frac{GH}{FH} = \frac{HJ}{HK}
$$

---

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

Using the given expressions for the lengths:
- $ \frac{x + 3.5}{21} = \frac{x - 8.5}{7} $

Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
$$
7(x + 3.5) = 21(x - 8.5)
$$

Simplify both sides:
$$
7x + 24.5 = 21x - 178.5
$$

Bring like terms together:
$$
24.5 + 178.5 = 21x - 7x
$$
$$
203 = 14x
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
x = \frac{203}{14} = 14.5
$$

---

### **Verification**

Check whether the computed value of $ x = 14.5 $ satisfies the original proportionality condition:

- $ GH = x + 3.5 = 14.5 + 3.5 = 18 $
- $ HJ = x - 8.5 = 14.5 - 8.5 = 6 $
- Ratios:
  $$
  \frac{GH}{FH} = \frac{18}{21} = \frac{6}{7}, \quad \frac{HJ}{HK} = \frac{6}{7}
  $$

These are equal, confirming the solution is consistent with the given geometric relationship.

---

### **Conclusion**

The only valid value of $ x $ satisfying all given conditions is:

$$
\boxed{14.5}
$$
