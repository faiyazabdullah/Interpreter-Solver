MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given points and lines. Let me note down all the information provided:

- Points: A, D, E, I, G, H, Y, B.
- Lines: AD, EI, GH.
- Constraints:
  - AD is parallel to EI.
  - The intersection of AD and GH is point Y.
  - The intersection of EI and GH is point B.
- Angles measured:
  - Angle at Y between D, Y, H (Angle(D,Y,H)) equals 3x - 15.
  - Angle at Y between A, Y, G (Angle(A,Y,G)) equals y + 25.
  - Angle at B between Y, B, E (Angle(Y,B,E)) equals 105 degrees.
  
We need to find the value of variable y.

First, since AD is parallel to EI, and GH is a transversal intersecting both, maybe there's some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles here. Also, points Y and B are intersections of these lines.

Let me sketch mentally. Line AD and line EI are parallel. Line GH intersects AD at Y and EI at B. So GH is a transversal cutting the two parallel lines AD and EI. Therefore, angles formed at Y and B might have relationships.

Looking at angle measures:

Angle(D,Y,H) is at point Y, between D-Y-H. Since AD is a straight line, D-Y is part of AD. Then H is another point on GH. Wait, GH is a line that intersects AD at Y and EI at B. So GH passes through Y and B. 

So GH is crossing AD at Y and EI at B. So for the parallel lines AD || EI, and transversal GH, then angles at Y and B should be related. For example, consecutive interior angles would be supplementary, or corresponding angles equal.

But let's think about specific angles. Let's consider triangle or other figures involved.

Alternatively, perhaps considering vertical angles or something else.

Wait, first, let's look at the angles mentioned:

1. Measure of angle(D,Y,H): This is the angle at Y between DY and HY. Since DY is along AD (since Y is on AD). HY is part of GH. So angle between AD and GH at Y.

Similarly, angle(A,Y,G): At Y between AY and GY. Since AY is along AD again. So this angle is between AD and GH at Y as well? Wait, but depending on which side. Maybe it's adjacent?

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that AD || EI, so when GH crosses them, certain angles are equal or supplementary.

Also, angle(Y,B,E) is at point B between Y-B-E. Since B is on EI, so BE is part of EI. And BY is part of GH. So angle between EI and GH at B.

Since AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then the angles formed at Y and B should be related.

For instance, angle at Y between AD and GH (which is angle(D,Y,H)) and angle at B between EI and GH (angle(Y,B,E)) could be same-side interior angles, making them supplementary. Or they could be corresponding angles if the lines are set up differently.

Wait, let me clarify:

If AD || EI, and GH is a trans's, then:

- The angle at Y between AD and GH (let's call it ∠DYH) and the angle at B between EI and GH (∠EBY) would be same-side interior angles. Thus their sum would be 180 degrees.

But according to the problem, measure of angle(Y,B,E) is 105°. Wait, angle(Y,B,E) is the angle at B between Y-B-E. Which is the same as angle EBY, right? Because B is the vertex. So ∠YBE = 105°, which would be the same as ∠EBY = 105°. If those are same-side interior angles with ∠DYH, then:

∠DYH + ∠EBY = 180° → ∠DYH = 180° - 105° = 75°.

But according to the problem, ∠DYH = 3x -15. Therefore:

3x -15 = 75 → 3x = 90 → x = 30.

So x=30. But how does this help us find y?

Now, looking at angle(A,Y,G). That's the angle at Y between AY and GY. Since AY is part of AD, and GY is part of GH. So this is another angle formed by the intersection of AD and GH at Y.

In the case of parallel lines and a transversal, the angles around the intersection points can be determined.

At point Y, the angles on line AD and GH. Since AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then:

The angle between AD and GH at Y (∠AYG) and the angle between EI and GH at B (∠EBY) may be corresponding angles? Or alternate?

Wait, if you imagine AD || EI, and GH cutting them. Then ∠AYG (at Y) and ∠EBY (at B) would be corresponding angles because they're on the same side of the transversal GH. However, since AD || EI, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, ∠AYG = ∠EBY.

But earlier, we found that ∠EBY = 105°, so ∠AYG would also be 105°. However, the problem says that measure of angle(A,Y,G) is y + 25. Therefore:

y + 25 = 105 → y = 80.

But wait, that seems straightforward. However, let me check if my assumption is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that ∠AYG corresponds to ∠EBY. Let me think about the direction of the lines. Suppose AD is horizontal, going from left to right, with A on the left and D on the right. EI is parallel to AD, so also horizontal. GH is a transversal crossing AD at Y and EI at B. Depending on the direction of GH, the angles could vary.

Assuming GH is slanting upwards from Y to B. So at Y, the angle between AD (going from A to D) and GH (going from Y to B) would be on one side. Similarly, at B, the angle between EI (from E to I) and GH (from B to Y) would be on the opposite side.

Wait, but if AD || EI, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So the angle between AD and GH at Y (∠AYG) would correspond to the angle between EI and GH at B (∠EBY). Hence, they are equal. Therefore, ∠AYG = ∠EBY = 105°, leading to y + 25 = 105 → y = 80.

However, answer option D is 80. But let me cross-check.

Alternatively, maybe ∠AYG is supplementary to ∠EBY? Let me think again. If the lines are cut by a transversal, and the lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

Wait, if GH is a transversal, then ∠AYG and ∠EBY are on the same side of the transversal GH, so they would be consecutive interior angles? No, because consecutive interior angles are on the same side of the transversal and between the two lines. Wait, but in this case, AD and EI are the two parallel lines, and GH is the transversal. So the angles at Y and B are on different sides.

Wait, maybe I need to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me imagine AD and EI are two horizontal lines, with AD above EI? Or vice versa? Let's assume AD is above EI. Then GH is a transversal that goes from Y (on AD) down to B (on EI).

At point Y, the angle between AD (horizontal) and GH (slanting downward) would be on the upper side. At point B, the angle between EI (horizontal) and GH (slanting upward) would be on the lower side. These angles would be corresponding angles if the lines are oriented properly. Wait, no. Corresponding angles are in the same relative position. So if you have two parallel lines cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. So if ∠AYG is on the upper side of GH at Y, then its corresponding angle would be on the upper side of GH at B. But since GH is passing through Y (upper line AD) and B (lower line EI), then the corresponding angle at B would be on the same side as Y. However, the angle at B is given as ∠YBE, which is between YB and BE. So if GH is going from Y to B downwards, then at B, the angle between EI and GH would be on the same side as the angle at Y.

Therefore, ∠AYG and ∠YBE are corresponding angles, hence equal. So ∠AYG = ∠YBE = 105°, so y +25 = 105 ⇒ y = 80. So that would mean answer D.

But wait, let me check again. Another possibility: perhaps angle(A,Y,G) is vertical angle with another angle?

Wait, at point Y, the angles formed by the intersection of AD and GH. There are four angles at Y: ∠DYH, ∠AYG, and others. Wait, since AD is a straight line, and GH crosses it at Y. So the angles at Y are:

- Between AY and YG: ∠AYG
- Between YG and YD: ∠GYD
- Between YD and YH: Wait, maybe not. Wait, GH is a line passing through Y. So at Y, the lines are AD (straight line) and GH. So the angles formed are:

At Y, the intersection of AD and GH creates two pairs of vertical angles. One pair is ∠AYG and ∠DYH (if GH is crossing AD at Y). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

AD is a straight line. Let me say AD goes from A to D. GH crosses AD at Y. So at Y, the line GH splits into two directions. So if you imagine standing at Y, facing towards D (along AD), then GH comes from one direction and goes off in another. The angle between AD and GH at Y would be between AY (part of AD) and GY (part of GH). So ∠AYG is that angle. Then the vertical angle would be across the intersection, which would be ∠DYH (assuming that GH continues past Y to H). Wait, but H is a point on GH. So if GH is extended beyond Y to H, then ∠DYH is adjacent to ∠AYG?

Wait, if AD is a straight line, and GH crosses it at Y, then the angles around Y would be:

- On one side of GH: ∠AYG and ∠DYH (opposite each other)
- On the other side: the other two angles.

Wait, actually, when two lines cross, vertical angles are opposite. So if GH crosses AD at Y, then the vertical angles are:

∠AYG and ∠DYH (if GH is such that YG is going one way and YH is going the other). Wait, maybe not. It depends on the direction of GH. Let me clarify:

Suppose GH crosses AD at Y, creating angles. Let me define direction. Let me suppose that GH is going from Y to G and Y to H. Wait, the line GH is defined as Line(G,H), so points G and H are on the line. So the line GH passes through Y and B. So the line GH has points G, Y, B, H? Not necessarily, but it passes through Y and B. So Y and B are two points on GH.

So, at point Y, the line GH is passing through Y, so it splits into two parts: one part going towards G, and the other towards H. Assuming that the order is G---Y---B---H or similar.

But regardless, the key thing is that the angles formed at Y by AD and GH. Let me denote that:

At point Y, AD is crossed by GH. So the angles formed are:

- Between AY (part of AD) and YG (part of GH): ∠AYG.
- Between YG and YD (part of AD): ∠GYD.
- Between YD and YH (if H is on the other side): but H is a separate point. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the line GH continues past Y to H, so the angle between YD and YH would depend on the direction of GH.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps using the fact that AD || EI and GH is a transversal, so the sum of angles on the same side is 180 degrees.

Earlier, I thought that ∠DYH (angle at Y between D-Y-H) and ∠EBY (angle at B between E-B-Y) are same-side interior angles, so their sum is 180. Then, since ∠EBY is 105, ∠DYH is 75. Then, ∠DYH = 3x -15, so 3x -15 =75 gives x=30.

Then, for angle AYG (angle at Y between A-Y-G), which is another angle formed by AD and GH at Y. Now, if AD is parallel to EI, and GH is a transversal, then the angles formed at Y and B should have relations.

If ∠AYG is equal to ∠EBY (as corresponding angles), then ∠AYG = 105°, which leads to y+25=105 → y=80. So answer D.

But another approach: maybe ∠AYG and ∠DYH are supplementary? Let me see.

At point Y, the angles on line AD and GH. If AD is a straight line, then angles on one side of GH at Y add up to 180 degrees. So ∠AYG + ∠GYD = 180°. But ∠GYD is adjacent to ∠DYH? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering that AD || EI, and GH is a transversal. The angle ∠DYH is an angle between AD and GH at Y. Then, the corresponding angle on EI would be ∠EBY (at B). So if they are corresponding angles, they are equal. Wait, but earlier calculation said that ∠DYH was 75°, and ∠EBY was 105°, which contradicts unless they are supplementary.

Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-examine.

If AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then the angles inside the parallel lines would be either corresponding, alternate interior, or consecutive interior.

If we consider the transversal GH intersecting AD at Y and EI at B. The angle at Y between AD and GH (say, ∠DYH) and the angle at B between EI and GH (say, ∠EBY) would be consecutive interior angles if they are on the same side of the transversal. In that case, they would be supplementary.

But earlier, I assumed that ∠DYH = 3x -15 and ∠EBY = 105°, so adding them gives 180°, giving 3x -15 +105 = 180 → 3x = 75 +15 = 90? Wait, 3x -15 +105 = 180 → 3x +90 = 180 → 3x=90 → x=30. Correct.

So that gives x=30. Now, for angle AYG. What is that angle?

At point Y, the line AD is intersected by GH. So angle AYG is the angle between AD (line AY) and GH (line YG). This is an angle on one side of the transversal. If we consider the relationship between this angle and other angles.

Since AD || EI, and GH is the transversal, then angle AYG (at Y) and angle EBY (at B) could be corresponding angles. If that's true, then they are equal. Hence, angle AYG = angle EBY = 105°, leading to y +25 =105 → y=80. So answer D.

But wait, why would angle AYG and angle EBY be corresponding angles?

Corresponding angles are angles that are in the same relative position at each intersection. So if you imagine the transversal GH crossing AD at Y and EI at B, then the angle between AD and GH at Y (which is angle AYG) would correspond to the angle between EI and GH at B (which is angle EBY). Yes, because they are both on the same side of the transversal (the side where GH is going from Y to B). Therefore, they are corresponding angles and thus equal. Therefore, angle AYG = angle EBY = 105°, so y +25 =105 → y=80.

Thus, the answer is D. However, let me check if there's another possibility.

Another approach: Maybe angle AYG is supplementary to angle EBY? If they were same-side interior angles. But that would require that they are on the same side of the transversal and between the two lines. But angle AYG is outside the space between AD and EI, whereas angle EBY is on the other side. So probably not.

Alternatively, if angle AYG and angle EBY are alternate interior angles? But that requires that they are on opposite sides of the transversal. But since AD and EI are parallel, alternate interior angles would be equal. But angle AYG is on one side of GH, and angle EBY on the other. So yes, they would be alternate interior angles. Wait, but alternate interior angles are between the two lines. So if the transversal is GH, then angle between AD and GH at Y (which is AYG) and angle between EI and GH at B (which is EBY) would be alternate interior angles only if the transversal cuts the two lines in such a way that they are on opposite sides.

Wait, alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So if the transversal GH crosses AD at Y and EI at B, then angle AYG (between AD and GH at Y) would be on one side of GH, and angle EBY (between EI and GH at B) would be on the other side. So they are alternate interior angles, hence equal. Therefore, angle AYG = angle EBY = 105°, leading to y=80.

Either way, whether they are corresponding or alternate interior angles, they are equal. Hence, y=80. So the answer is D.

But wait, let me confirm once more. Suppose angle AYG is equal to angle EBY. Given that angle EBY is 105°, then angle AYG is 105°, so y +25 = 105 → y=80. So answer D.

But looking at the answer choices, D is 80. So that's the answer. Unless there's a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me verify with another method. Suppose we calculate all angles and check consistency.

From before:

Angle(D,Y,H) = 3x -15 = 75°, so x=30.

Angle(Y,B,E)=105°, which we used to get angle(D,Y,H)=75°.

Now, what about angle(A,Y,G)? If angle AYG is 105°, then y=80.

But maybe there's another relation involving these angles. For example, considering triangle YBG or something else?

Wait, point Y is on AD, point B is on EI, and GH connects them. Are there triangles involved? For example, triangle YGB? Or maybe triangle YBH?

Alternatively, considering the sum of angles around point Y. At point Y, the angles around it should add up to 360°. But since AD is a straight line, and GH is another line, the angles at Y would form linear pairs.

Specifically, at point Y, the angles on line AD and GH. Let me consider:

The angles at Y are:

- Between AD and GH: angle AYG and angle DYH (assuming they are vertical angles?)

Wait, if GH crosses AD at Y, then the vertical angles would be:

∠AYG and ∠DYH (if GH extends in such a way that those are opposite angles). So if those are vertical angles, then they are equal. But earlier, we had ∠DYH =75°, so ∠AYG would also be 75°, which conflicts with previous conclusion. Wait, this suggests a contradiction. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Here's a critical error. Earlier, I thought that angle AYG and angle EBY are equal, but if angle AYG is vertical to angle DYH, then angle AYG = angle DYH =75°, leading to y +25 =75 → y=50. Which would be answer B.

But this contradicts the prior conclusion. So which is correct?

This shows that my initial reasoning had a flaw. Let me resolve this carefully.

When two lines intersect, vertical angles are equal. So, if GH intersects AD at Y, then the vertical angles are:

- ∠AYG and ∠DYH (if GH is crossing AD at Y, then those are vertical angles).
- ∠AYG and ∠DYH are vertical angles, hence equal.

Therefore, ∠AYG = ∠DYH =75°, which would imply that y +25 =75 → y=50. Hence, answer B.

But earlier I thought that angle AYG is equal to angle EBY, which led to y=80. So conflicting conclusions. Which is correct?

Let me go back. If angle AYG is vertical to angle DYH, then they are equal. Therefore, angle AYG = angle DYH =75°. Hence, y+25=75 → y=50.

But then, what about angle EBY? How does it relate?

If AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then angle EBY is a corresponding angle or alternate interior angle with respect to angle DYH?

Wait, angle EBY is at point B, between EB and YB. Since EI is parallel to AD, and GH is the transversal. So angle EBY is an angle on EI, between EI and GH. Let me consider:

Since AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then angle EBY and angle DYH are same-side interior angles. Hence, their sum is 180°. As previously stated: angle EBY + angle DYH = 180°. We know angle EBY is 105°, so angle DYH = 75°, which matches.

But angle DYH is equal to angle AYG (vertical angles), so angle AYG =75°, which implies y +25=75 → y=50. So answer B.

But earlier thinking suggested that angle AYG = angle EBY due to being corresponding angles, but that was incorrect. The correct relationship is that angle EBY and angle DYH are same-side interior angles (summing to 180°), while angle AYG is vertical to angle DYH, hence equal to it. So that gives y=50.

But why did I think earlier that angle AYG and EBY are corresponding angles?

Perhaps because of misidentifying the angles' positions. Let me clarify:

If AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, then:

- The angle between AD and GH at Y (which is angle AYG) and the angle between EI and GH at B (which is angle EBY) are not corresponding angles, because they are on the same side of the transversal. Instead, angle EBY is a same-side interior angle with angle DYH, which is vertical to angle AYG.

Therefore, angle EBY + angle DYH = 180°, and angle AYG = angle DYH.

Hence, angle AYG =75°, so y +25 =75 → y=50. Hence, answer B.

This suggests that the correct answer is B. But why did I initially think it was D?

Because I confused angle AYG with angle EBY, assuming they were corresponding, but in reality, angle AYG is vertical to angle DYH, which is supplementary to angle EBY.

So the correct reasoning leads to y=50, which is answer B.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion. Where is the mistake?

Let me re-express:

At point Y, GH intersects AD. Vertical angles are:

- ∠AYG and ∠DYH (they are opposite each other)
- ∠AYG = ∠DYH.

Since AD || EI and GH is a transversal, ∠DYH and ∠EBY are same-side interior angles, so ∠DYH + ∠EBY = 180°. We know ∠EBY =105°, so ∠DYH =75°, which means ∠AYG =75°. Therefore, y +25 =75 → y=50.

Thus, answer B.

This makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

But earlier steps had conflicting conclusions. Why? Because initially I thought angle AYG corresponds to angle EBY, but in reality, angle AYG is vertical to angle DYH, which is supplementary to angle EBY.

So the correct answer is B. 50.

But why did I think earlier that angle AYG and angle EBY are equal? Probably because of misidentifying the angles' positions. So this shows the importance of careful analysis.

Therefore, after correcting myself, the correct value of y is 50, answer B.

But let me check again with another approach.

Let me consider the entire setup. Since AD || EI, and GH is a transversal intersecting them at Y and B respectively.

At point Y, the angles formed by GH and AD are:

- ∠AYG (between AY and YG)
- ∠GYD (adjacent to ∠AYG, forming a linear pair with it)
- ∠DYH (another angle, which is vertical to ∠AYG)

And at point B, the angles formed by GH and EI are:

- ∠EBY (given as 105°)
- ∠YBI (other angle)

Now, since AD || EI, and GH is a transversal, the angles ∠EBY and ∠DYH are same-side interior angles. Hence, ∠EBY + ∠DYH = 180°. As before, ∠DYH = 75°, so ∠EBY =105°.

Since ∠DYH is vertical to ∠AYG, they are equal. Hence, ∠AYG =75°, which equals y +25. Solving gives y=50. Hence, answer B.

Yes, this confirms it. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, we start by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying the principles of parallel lines and transversals. The key elements of the problem include:

- **Parallel lines**: $ \text{Line}(A, D) \parallel \text{Line}(E, I) $
- **Transversal**: $ \text{Line}(G, H) $ intersects both $ \text{Line}(A, D) $ and $ \text{Line}(E, I) $ at points $ Y $ and $ B $, respectively.
- **Angles**:
  - $ \angle(D, Y, H) = 3x - 15 $
  - $ \angle(A, Y, G) = y + 25 $
  - $ \angle(Y, B, E) = 105^\circ $

---

### Step 1: Use Same-Side Interior Angles
Since $ \text{Line}(A, D) \parallel \text{Line}(E, I) $ and $ \text{Line}(G, H) $ is a transversal, the angles formed by the intersection at points $ Y $ and $ B $ have known relationships.

- $ \angle(D, Y, H) $ and $ \angle(Y, B, E) $ are **same-side interior angles**, so their measures must sum to $ 180^\circ $:
  $$
  \angle(D, Y, H) + \angle(Y, B, E) = 180^\circ
  $$

Substitute the given values:
$$
(3x - 15) + 105 = 180
$$
$$
3x + 90 = 180
\Rightarrow 3x = 90
\Rightarrow x = 30
$$

---

### Step 2: Analyze $ \angle(D, Y, H) $
Using the value of $ x $:
$$
\angle(D, Y, H) = 3x - 15 = 3(30) - 15 = 75^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine Relationship Between $ \angle(D, Y, H) $ and $ \angle(A, Y, G) $
Now, observe that $ \angle(D, Y, H) $ and $ \angle(A, Y, G) $ are **vertical angles** formed at point $ Y $ by the intersection of $ \text{Line}(A, D) $ and $ \text{Line}(G, H) $. Vertical angles are always congruent, so:

$$
\angle(A, Y, G) = \angle(D, Y, H) = 75^\circ
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ y $
Given:
$$
\angle(A, Y, G) = y + 25
$$
$$
y + 25 = 75
\Rightarrow y = 50
$$

---

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{B}
$$

Final Answer: B
