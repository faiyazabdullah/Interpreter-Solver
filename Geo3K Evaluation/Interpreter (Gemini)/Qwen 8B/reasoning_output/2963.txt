MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. 

So, we have triangle ABC. Points P, Q, R are on line AB. CP is an altitude, which means it's perpendicular to AB. Also, CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB. R is the midpoint of AB. The angles mentioned are related through variables x. Specifically, angle ACB is given as 123 - x degrees, angle QCB is 42 + x degrees, and there's another relation between angles ACQ and QCB. We need to find the measure of angle ACQ.

Let me start by recalling some key concepts. Since CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB, it splits that angle into two equal parts. Wait, but here angle ACB is split into angle ACQ and angle QCB. So according to the Angle Bisector Theorem, those two angles should be equal? Wait, no—the angle bisector divides the angle into two congruent angles. But in this case, the problem says that angle ACQ equals angle QCB? Let me check the given equations again.

Looking back at the constraints:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,Q)), MeasureOf(Angle(Q,C,B))) — so angle ACQ equals angle QCB. But wait, angle QCB is given as 42 + x, and angle ACB is 123 - x. Since angle ACB is composed of angles ACQ and QCB, then angle ACB = angle ACQ + angle QCB. But since they're equal (from the equation), each would be half of angle ACB. Wait, but that seems conflicting with the given expressions for angle ACB and angle QCB. Let me write down these equations properly.

Let me denote:

Let’s define:

m∠ACB = 123 - x  
m∠QCB = 42 + x  
Also, from the last constraint: SumOf(m∠ACQ, m∠QCB) = m∠ACB. And also, m∠ACQ = m∠QCB. 

Wait, the problem states:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,Q)),MeasureOf(Angle(Q,C,B))),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)))

Which translates to:

m∠ACQ + m∠QCB = m∠ACB

And another equality:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,Q)),MeasureOf(Angle(Q,C,B)))

Which implies:

m∠ACQ = m∠QCB

Therefore, substituting the second into the first equation:

m∠ACQ + m∠ACQ = m∠ACB → 2 * m∠ACQ = m∠ACB

But from the problem statement, m∠ACB = 123 - x and m∠QCB = 42 + x. However, since m∠ACQ = m∠QCB, that would mean:

m∠ACQ = 42 + x

Then substituting into the previous equation:

2*(42 + x) = 123 - x

Let me solve this equation for x:

Left side: 84 + 2x  
Right side: 123 - x  
Set equal:

84 + 2x = 123 - x  
Adding x to both sides: 84 + 3x = 123  
Subtracting 84: 3x = 39  
Divide by 3: x = 13

Now, substitute x back into m∠ACQ = 42 + x:

m∠ACQ = 42 + 13 = 55 degrees

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 55. So that would suggest the answer is D. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes there might be an error in interpreting the relationships.

First, verifying the key points:

Since CQ is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, then ∠ACQ should equal ∠QCB. Therefore, their measures are equal. Then, the sum of these two angles equals ∠ACB. Hence:

∠ACQ + ∠QCB = ∠ACB  
But since ∠ACQ = ∠QCB, then 2*∠ACQ = ∠ACB  
Thus, ∠ACQ = (∠ACB)/2  

However, according to the problem, ∠ACB = 123 - x, and ∠QCB = 42 + x. But since ∠ACQ = ∠QCB, then ∠ACQ = 42 + x. Therefore, substituting into the above equation:

2*(42 + x) = 123 - x  
Which gives us solving for x:

84 + 2x = 123 - x  
Bring terms together: 2x + x = 123 - 84  
3x = 39  
x = 13  

So then ∠ACQ = 42 + 13 = 55 degrees. Which matches option D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For example, maybe there's something about the altitude or the midpoint? But in this case, the problem mentions that CP is an altitude, meaning it's perpendicular to AB, but does that affect the angles? Maybe not directly, since we were given relations between the angles via the angle bisector and the midpoint. However, perhaps the fact that R is the midpoint of AB might relate to other properties, but since the problem only asks for angle ACQ, which is determined purely by the angle bisector and the given equations, maybe that's not necessary here. 

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in assuming that ∠ACQ equals ∠QCB? Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says:

"BisectsAngle(Line(C,Q),Angle(A,C,B))"

Which means that Line CQ bisects angle ACB. Therefore, yes, it splits angle ACB into two equal angles: ∠ACQ and ∠QCB. Hence, they must be equal. Thus, the earlier reasoning holds. 

Another check: Let's compute ∠ACB using x=13. Then ∠ACB = 123 - 13 = 110 degrees. Then ∠ACQ = 55 degrees, and ∠QCB = 42 + 13 = 55 degrees. Adding them gives 55+55=110, which matches ∠ACB. That checks out. 

Therefore, the measure of ∠ACQ is 55 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice D. 

I think that's solid. No contradictions in the logic here. All equations balance when x=13. So unless there's a misinterpretation of the problem's constraints, this should be correct.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle ACQ $, we begin by analyzing the relationships among the angles in triangle $ ABC $, given the conditions:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are told:

- $ \angle ACB = 123 - x $
- $ \angle QCB = 42 + x $
- $ \angle ACQ = \angle QCB $ (since $ CQ $ is the angle bisector of $ \angle ACB $)
- $ \angle ACQ + \angle QCB = \angle ACB $

From this, we can express:

$$
\angle ACQ + \angle QCB = \angle ACB
$$

Given $ \angle ACQ = \angle QCB $, we substitute:

$$
\angle ACQ + \angle ACQ = \angle ACB \Rightarrow 2 \cdot \angle ACQ = \angle ACB
$$

---

### **Step 2: Substitute Expressions and Solve for $ x $**

We are also given:

$$
\angle QCB = 42 + x \quad \text{and} \quad \angle ACQ = \angle QCB
$$

So,

$$
\angle ACQ = 42 + x
$$

Using the earlier derived relationship:

$$
2 \cdot \angle ACQ = \angle ACB
\Rightarrow 2(42 + x) = 123 - x
$$

Simplify:

$$
84 + 2x = 123 - x
\Rightarrow 3x = 39
\Rightarrow x = 13
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute $ \angle ACQ $**

Substitute $ x = 13 $ into the expression for $ \angle ACQ $:

$$
\angle ACQ = 42 + x = 42 + 13 = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ \angle ACQ $ is $ 55^\circ $, corresponding to **Answer Choice D**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: D}}
$$
