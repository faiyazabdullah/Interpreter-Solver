MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have quadrilateral WXYZ, right? And there are several angles given in terms of 'a'. The question is asking for the measure of angle Z, which I think refers to angle at point Z, so maybe angle YZW or something like that? Wait, the angles mentioned are Angle(X,W,Z) which would be angle at W between X and Z, then Angle(W,X,Y) is at X, Angle(X,Y,Z) at Y, and Angle(Y,Z,W) at Z. Wait, no, let me clarify each angle:

- Angle(X,W,Z): This is the angle at point W formed by points X, W, Z. So vertex at W, with sides WX and WZ. So that's angle W.

Wait, but the problem says "Angle(X,W,Z)" which is standard notation for angle at W between X and Z. Similarly, Angle(W,X,Y) is angle at X between W and Y. Then Angle(X,Y,Z) is angle at Y between X and Z. Then Angle(Y,Z,W) is angle at Z between Y and W. So the four angles of the quadrilateral are at W, X, Y, Z respectively. But wait, quadrilaterals have four angles, so these four angles sum up to 360 degrees. 

The measures of each angle are given as expressions involving 'a':

- Measure of Angle(X,W,Z) (which is angle at W) is Add(Div(a,2), 8). So that's (a/2 + 8).

- Measure of Angle(W,X,Y) (angle at X) is just 'a'.

- Measure of Angle(X,Y,Z) (angle at Y) is Sub(a, 28), so that's (a - 28).

- Measure of Angle(Y,Z,W) (angle at Z) is Add(a, 2), so (a + 2).

And the sum of all these four angles equals 360 degrees. Therefore, adding them together:

(a/2 + 8) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360.

So let me write that equation:

First term: (a/2 + 8)

Second term: a

Third term: (a - 28)

Fourth term: (a + 2)

Adding all together:

Let me combine like terms. Let's convert all terms to fractions over 2 to make it easier.

First term: a/2 + 8

Second term: a = 2a/2

Third term: a - 28 = (2a)/2 - 28

Fourth term: a + 2 = 2a/2 + 2

But maybe another way: Combine all terms without converting.

Let me expand the entire expression:

(a/2 + 8) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) =

Combine constants first: 8 - 28 + 2 = (8 + 2) -28 = 10 -28 = -18

Then the variables:

a/2 + a + a + a = ?

Let me compute coefficients:

a/2 + a is (1/2 + 1)a = 3a/2

Then adding another a gives 3a/2 + a = 5a/2

Another a added: 5a/2 + a = 7a/2

So total expression is (7a/2) - 18 = 360.

Therefore:

(7a)/2 - 18 = 360

Add 18 to both sides:

(7a)/2 = 360 + 18 = 378

Multiply both sides by 2:

7a = 756

Divide by 7:

a = 756 / 7

Calculate that: 7*100=700, so 756-700=56. 56/7=8. So total a = 100 + 8 = 108.

So a = 108 degrees.

Now, the question asks for m∠Z. Which angle is that?

Looking back, the angles were:

Angle(X,W,Z): angle at W, which was (a/2 + 8)

Angle(W,X,Y): angle at X, which was a

Angle(X,Y,Z): angle at Y, which was (a - 28)

Angle(Y,Z,W): angle at Z, which was (a + 2)

So angle at Z is (a + 2). Since a is 108, substitute:

108 + 2 = 110 degrees.

So m∠Z is 110 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 110.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might mix up angles.

Wait, the problem mentions "Angle(Y,Z,W)", which is angle at Z between Y and W. So yes, that's angle Z. So substituting a=108 into (a+2) gives 110. So answer is C.

But let me check again the equations. Maybe I made a mistake when combining terms.

Original sum:

(a/2 + 8) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = ?

Let me recompute:

Breakdown:

Term1: a/2 + 8

Term2: a

Term3: a - 28

Term4: a + 2

Total sum:

a/2 + 8 + a + a - 28 + a + 2

Combine like terms:

For a terms: a/2 + a + a + a = a/2 + 3a = (1/2 + 3)a = (7/2)a

Constants: 8 -28 +2 = (8 + 2) -28 = 10 -28 = -18

Thus total sum: (7a)/2 -18 = 360

Which leads to 7a/2 = 378 => a = 378 * 2 /7 = 756 /7 = 108. Correct.

So angle at Z is a + 2 = 108 +2 = 110. So answer is C. 110.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me check if answer choices include C. Yes, option C is 110. So Final Answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle Z $ in quadrilateral $ WXYZ $, we begin by analyzing the given information and setting up an equation based on the angle measures expressed in terms of variable $ a $. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Angles**

We are told the measures of the four interior angles of quadrilateral $ WXYZ $ in terms of $ a $:

- $ \angle XWZ = \frac{a}{2} + 8 $
- $ \angle WXY = a $
- $ \angle XYZ = a - 28 $
- $ \angle YZW = a + 2 $

These are the four angles of the quadrilateral, and their sum must equal $ 360^\circ $, since the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always $ 360^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

$$
\left( \frac{a}{2} + 8 \right) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:

- Combine $ a $ terms:  
  $$
  \frac{a}{2} + a + a + a = \frac{a}{2} + 3a = \frac{7a}{2}
  $$

- Combine constant terms:  
  $$
  8 - 28 + 2 = -18
  $$

So the full equation becomes:

$$
\frac{7a}{2} - 18 = 360
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ a $**

$$
\frac{7a}{2} = 360 + 18 = 378
$$

$$
7a = 756 \Rightarrow a = \frac{756}{7} = 108
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find $ \angle Z $**

Recall that $ \angle YZW $ corresponds to $ \angle Z $, and its measure is:

$$
\angle Z = a + 2 = 108 + 2 = 110
$$

---

### **Final Answer**
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

**Final Answer: C**
