MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find GI given the information. So, we have triangle GJ I, and points K and H. The problem gives several conditions:

First, there's a line GH which is part of triangle GKH, and it says that GH equals 9. Also, GK is 6, and KJ is 4. Plus, there's some similarity between triangles GKH and GJI. And lines KH and JI are parallel. 

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch mentally. Points G, J, I form a triangle. Point K is on line GJ because it's stated that point K lies on line GJ. Wait, no—wait, looking back at the constraints: PointK lies on Line(G,J). So K is on GJ. Then H is on line GI. Because PointH lies on Line(G,I). Also, line KH is parallel to line JI. 

So, since KH is parallel to JI, maybe similar triangles come into play here. Also, there's a similarity between Triangle GKH and Triangle GJI. Let me note that down. The similarity ratio would relate their corresponding sides. 

Given that, the similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So for example, the ratio of GK to GJ should be equal to the ratio of GH to GI, since those are corresponding sides. But wait, need to make sure which sides correspond. Since the triangles are GKH and GJI, so vertex G corresponds to G, K corresponds to J, and H corresponds to I? Or maybe another order? Let me think. 

If the similarity is Triangle(G,K,H) ~ Triangle(G,J,I), then the correspondence is G to G, K to J, H to I. Therefore, the sides GK corresponds to GJ, KH corresponds to JI, and GH corresponds to GI. So the ratio of GK/GJ = KH/JI = GH/GI. 

But also, we know that KH is parallel to JI, which aligns with the similarity, as corresponding angles would be equal due to the parallel lines. 

Now, given that, let's use the given lengths. We know that GH = 9, GK = 6, KJ = 4. Wait, KJ is part of line GJ, right? Because K is on GJ. So GJ is split into GK and KJ. So the length of GJ is GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10. So GJ = 10. 

Since the similarity ratio between triangles GKH and GJI is GK / GJ. Which would be 6/10 = 3/5. Therefore, the ratio of GH/GI should also be 3/5. 

We know GH is 9, so set up the equation: 9 / GI = 3/5. Solving for GI gives GI = (9 * 5)/3 = 15. So that would mean GI is 15. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 15. 

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other relationships or steps I might have missed? For instance, the problem mentions that the sum of LengthOf(Line(G,K)) + LengthOf(Line(K,J)) equals LengthOf(Line(G,J)). Which checks out since 6 + 4 = 10, which matches GJ being 10. 

Also, the ratio of GH/GI equals GK/GJ. So substituting numbers: GH=9, GK=6, GJ=10. Therefore, 9/GI = 6/10 → GI = (9*10)/6 = 15. Yep, same result. So the answer should be D. 

Alternatively, could there be another way to approach this? Maybe using coordinates? Let me try that as a cross-check. Suppose we assign coordinates to the points. Let’s place point G at (0,0). Let’s assume line GI is along the x-axis for simplicity. So point I would be at (x, 0), but since H is on line GI, H would also lie somewhere on the x-axis. However, point K is on line GJ. Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps coordinate geometry might complicate things. Alternatively, since we already used the similarity ratio and got GI = 15, and the steps seem consistent, I think that's solid. 

Another thing to confirm: the ratio of GH to GI equals the ratio of GK to GJ. Since the triangles are similar, that's a direct consequence. So yes, the ratio holds. Hence, GI = 15. So answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:

To determine the value of $ GI $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying the principles of **similar triangles** and **proportionality** based on the given constraints.

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

- Triangle $ \triangle GJI $
- Points: $ G, J, I, K, H $
- Lines:
  - $ \overline{GJ}, \overline{GI}, \overline{JI} $ are sides of triangle $ GJI $
  - $ \overline{KH} $ is a segment such that:
    - $ K $ lies on $ \overline{GJ} $
    - $ H $ lies on $ \overline{GI} $
    - $ \overline{KH} \parallel \overline{JI} $
- Segment lengths:
  - $ GH = 9 $
  - $ GK = 6 $
  - $ KJ = 4 $

From these, we can deduce:
$$
GJ = GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Similar Triangles

It is given that:
$$
\triangle GKH \sim \triangle GJI
$$

This similarity tells us that the **corresponding sides are proportional**, and the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. From the notation $ \triangle GKH \sim \triangle GJI $, we can identify the side pairings:
- $ GK $ corresponds to $ GJ $
- $ GH $ corresponds to $ GI $
- $ KH $ corresponds to $ JI $

Thus, the proportion becomes:
$$
\frac{GH}{GI} = \frac{GK}{GJ}
$$

Substitute known values:
$$
\frac{GH}{GI} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

Now plug in $ GH = 9 $ and solve for $ GI $:
$$
\frac{9}{GI} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
3 \cdot GI = 9 \cdot 5 = 45 \quad \Rightarrow \quad GI = \frac{45}{3} = 15
$$

---

### Final Result

The computed value of $ GI $ is $ 15 $. This matches **option D** among the given answer choices.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: D}}
$$
