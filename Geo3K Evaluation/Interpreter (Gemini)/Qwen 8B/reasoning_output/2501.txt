====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have triangle PQR with points S and T. The key information given is that ST is parallel to RQ. Also, PS is 12.5 units, SR is 5 units, PT is 15 units, and there are some similar triangles mentioned. We need to find TQ.

First, I remember that when two lines are parallel, like ST || RQ, it might create similar triangles. The problem mentions that triangle PST is similar to triangle PRQ. Wait, let me check the constraints again. It says Similar(Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(P,R,Q)). So triangle PST ~ triangle PRQ. That similarity should help us set up proportions.

Since they're similar triangles, their corresponding sides should be in proportion. Let me write down the correspondence. The order matters here. Triangle PST corresponds to triangle PRQ. So vertex P corresponds to P, S corresponds to R, and T corresponds to Q? Or maybe another way? Let me think. The order of the vertices in the similarity statement is important. So Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q). Therefore:

- P corresponds to P
- S corresponds to R
- T corresponds to Q

So the sides opposite these angles would correspond. Let me recall that in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.

Therefore, the ratio of PS to PR should be equal to the ratio of PT to PQ, and also equal to the ratio of ST to RQ.

But wait, we know PS is 12.5 and SR is 5. Wait, SR is part of PR? Because S is on PR? Let me check the constraints again. There's a PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(P,R)), so point S lies on line PR. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(T, Line(P,Q)), meaning T is on line PQ. So PR is split into PS and SR, which are 12.5 and 5. Therefore, the entire length PR is PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5 units.

Similarly, since T is on PQ, and PT is given as 15. Let me denote TQ as x, which is what we need to find. Then PQ would be PT + TQ = 15 + x.

Now, because of the similarity between triangle PST and triangle PRQ. Let me confirm the correspondence again. Since the similarity is PST ~ PRQ, then:

PS / PR = PT / PQ = ST / RQ.

We already have PS = 12.5, PR = 17.5 (since PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5). So the ratio PS/PR is 12.5 / 17.5. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 12.5: 1 / (17.5/12.5) = 1 / 1.4. Wait, but 17.5 divided by 12.5 is 1.4, which is 7/5. So 12.5 / 17.5 = (25/2) / (35/2) )= 25/35 = 5/7. Oh right, simplifying 12.5 over 17.5: both numbers can be multiplied by 2 to eliminate decimals: 25/35 = 5/7. So the ratio is 5/7.

Therefore, according to the similarity, PT/PQ should also be 5/7. But PT is 15, and PQ is 15 + x. So setting up the equation:

PT / PQ = 5 / 7 => 15 / (15 + x) = 5 / 7.

Cross-multiplying: 15 * 7 = 5 * (15 + x)

Calculating left side: 105 = 75 + 5x

Subtracting 75: 105 - 75 = 5x => 30 = 5x => x = 6.

Wait, so TQ is 6? Let me check if that makes sense. So if x is 6, then PQ is 15 + 6 = 21. Then the ratio PT/PQ is 15/21 = 5/7, which matches the earlier ratio. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the correspondence of the similar triangles. Let me double-check. The similarity is between triangle PST and triangle PRQ. So angle at P is common? Wait, no. Let me visualize the diagram. Points S is on PR, T is on PQ. Lines ST and RQ are parallel. So triangle PST and triangle PRQ. Let me think about the angles. Since ST is parallel to RQ, then angle PST is congruent to angle PRQ (corresponding angles), and angle PTS is congruent to angle PQR. Therefore, the triangles are similar by AA similarity. So yes, the similarity holds.

Thus, the ratios of corresponding sides should hold. Another way: PS corresponds to PR, PT corresponds to PQ, and ST corresponds to RQ. Hence, the ratio PS/PR = PT/PQ = ST/RQ. So our calculation above holds.

Another thing to verify: the ratio of PS/SR equals PT/TQ? Wait, the problem also states that the ratio of PS/SR equals the ratio of PT/TQ. Let me check that. Given that PS is 12.5, SR is 5, so PS/SR is 12.5/5 = 2.5. And PT is 15, so PT/TQ would be 15/x. Setting them equal: 15/x = 2.5 => x = 15 / 2.5 = 6. Which gives TQ = 6. So same answer. Thus, confirming that TQ is 6. Therefore, the answer should be B. 6.

But let me make sure there isn't another approach. For example, using coordinate geometry. Suppose we assign coordinates. Let me try that. Let me place point P at (0, 0). Let me assume that line PR is along the x-axis for simplicity. Then point S is somewhere on PR. Since PS is 12.5 and SR is 5, total PR is 17.5. So coordinates: P(0,0), R(17.5, 0), S(12.5, 0).

Then, since ST is parallel to RQ. Let me find coordinates of T and Q. However, since T is on PQ, and ST || RQ. Maybe parametrize. Alternatively, use vectors.

But perhaps this is more complicated than needed. Since we've already confirmed through two methods (similarity ratio and ratio of segments) that TQ is 6, which is option B. So unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be B.

Wait, let me check the ratio again. The problem also says that the ratio of PS/SR equals the ratio of PT/TQ. So PS/SR = 12.5 / 5 = 2.5. Then PT / TQ = 15 / x = 2.5. Solving gives x = 15 / 2.5 = 6. Exactly. So that's straightforward. Hence, answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ TQ $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration involving triangles and parallel lines.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \triangle PQR $ has points $ S $ and $ T $ such that:
  - $ S \in \text{Line}(P,R) $
  - $ T \in \text{Line}(P,Q) $
- $ \overline{ST} \parallel \overline{RQ} $
- $ PS = 12.5 $, $ SR = 5 $, $ PT = 15 $
- $ \triangle PST \sim \triangle PRQ $

This similarity implies that the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional, and the angles are equal.

---

### **Step 2: Use of Similar Triangles**

From the similarity $ \triangle PST \sim \triangle PRQ $, we get the proportionality relationship:

$$
\frac{PS}{PR} = \frac{PT}{PQ}
$$

#### **Compute $ PR $**  
Since $ PS = 12.5 $ and $ SR = 5 $, and $ S $ lies on segment $ \overline{PR} $, we calculate:

$$
PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5
$$

Let $ TQ = x $. Then $ PQ = PT + TQ = 15 + x $.

Now apply the similarity ratio:

$$
\frac{PS}{PR} = \frac{PT}{PQ} \Rightarrow \frac{12.5}{17.5} = \frac{15}{15 + x}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve the Proportion**

Simplify the left-hand side:

$$
\frac{12.5}{17.5} = \frac{5}{7}
$$

Set the equality:

$$
\frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{15 + x}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
5(15 + x) = 7 \cdot 15 \Rightarrow 75 + 5x = 105
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
5x = 30 \Rightarrow x = 6
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verification via Segment Ratios**

An alternative confirmation comes from the fact that the ratio of $ \frac{PS}{SR} = \frac{PT}{TQ} $, based on the given condition:

$$
\frac{PS}{SR} = \frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5, \quad \frac{PT}{TQ} = \frac{15}{x}
$$

Equating:

$$
\frac{15}{x} = 2.5 \Rightarrow x = \frac{15}{2.5} = 6
$$

This confirms the solution.

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ TQ $ is $ 6 $. Among the given answer choices, this corresponds to:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

---

**Final Answer:** B
