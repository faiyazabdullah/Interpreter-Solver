Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several points and lines with some given lengths and relationships. The main goal is to find the value of x such that ED equals 2x - 3. Let's start by listing all the given information and see how they connect.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them:

- Line(A,E) has length 3 (since AE = 3)
- Line(A,B) is 2 units long (AB = 2)
- Line(B,C) is 6 units (BC = 6)
- Line(E,D) is given as 2x - 3
- Line(C,D) is part of quadrilateral BCDE? Wait, there's also Line(B,E), so maybe it's a quadrilateral BCDE?

Also, there's a triangle ABE and quadrilateral BCDE. Additionally, there's a similarity between triangles ABE and CDE. Also, lines AB and CD are parallel. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E. Let me think about the structure. Since AB is connected to E, forming triangle ABE. Then BC connects to C, which connects to D via line CD. Also, BE connects to E and D. So quadrilateral BCDE has sides BC, CD, DE, EB. Wait, but line BE is part of triangle ABE. So quadrilateral BCDE would have sides BC, CD, DE, and EB. But since BE is a side, then yes. 

Now, the key thing here is the similarity between triangle ABE and triangle CDE. Because similar triangles have proportional sides. Also, since AB and CD are parallel, that might indicate something about angles or proportions. Let me recall that if two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion, and their corresponding angles are equal. 

So first, let's note the triangles involved. Triangle ABE and triangle CDE are similar. Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. But I need to make sure which sides correspond. Since AB corresponds to CD because they are parallel? Or maybe based on the order of the letters. Let me check the similarity notation: Similar(Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(C,D,E)). So the correspondence is A→C, B→D, E→E? Wait, no. Wait, similar triangles are ordered. So Triangle ABE ~ Triangle CDE. So vertex A corresponds to C, B to D, E to E? Wait, but E is common in both triangles? That seems odd. Wait, Triangle ABE has vertices A, B, E. Triangle CDE has vertices C, D, E. So the order is important. So the correspondence would be A corresponds to C, B corresponds to D, and E corresponds to E. Wait, but then angle at E would be common? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. Let me think again. If the similarity is between ABE and CDE, then the order of the vertices matters. For example, if Angle A corresponds to Angle C, Angle B to Angle D, and Angle E to Angle E. That would mean that angle E is shared? Wait, but in triangle ABE, angle E is between AE and BE. In triangle CDE, angle E is between CE and DE. So if those angles are equal, then maybe the similarity is such that the sides opposite these angles correspond. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is A-B-E to C-D-E. So AB corresponds to CD, BE corresponds to DE, and AE corresponds to CE. Wait, but since AB and CD are parallel, maybe that gives us some info. 

But let me take it step by step. Since Triangle ABE ~ Triangle CDE, then the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Let me write down the correspondence. If the similarity is ABE ~ CDE, then the order implies that AB corresponds to CD, BE corresponds to DE, and AE corresponds to CE. Wait, but CE isn't directly given. However, we know that CD is part of the quadrilateral BCDE, and we have BC = 6. Let me try to find relations between the sides.

Given that AB || CD, which could imply that the triangles ABE and CDE are similar due to some transversal and parallel lines. Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CD, then angles formed by a transversal might be equal. For instance, if lines AB and CD are cut by a transversal BE, then alternate interior angles would be equal. Which might lead to similarity. 

But let's focus on the similarity. Let's suppose that Triangle ABE ~ Triangle CDE. Then, the ratio of AB/CD = BE/DE = AE/CE. 

But I don't know CE yet. However, maybe I can express CE in terms of other segments. Let me consider the quadrilateral BCDE. It's a quadrilateral with sides BC=6, CD=?, DE=2x-3, and BE. Also, since AB || CD, perhaps BCDE is a trapezoid? Because AB is parallel to CD. Wait, but AB is connected to E, and CD is connected to D. Maybe not necessarily a trapezoid unless certain conditions hold. Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CD, then maybe BC and DE are the legs of the trapezoid? Not sure. But perhaps using the similarity ratio.

Let me get back to the similarity. Suppose Triangle ABE ~ Triangle CDE. Then AB / CD = BE / DE = AE / CE. 

We know AB = 2, AE = 3, and DE = 2x - 3. We need to relate these. However, we need expressions for CD, BE, and CE. Let me see if we can find CD. CD is part of the quadrilateral BCDE. Since BC = 6, and CD is connected to D. But without knowing more about the shape, maybe we can use the fact that AB || CD. 

Since AB || CD, then the distance between AB and CD is constant. However, without coordinates, it's hard to say. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to model the situation. 

Let me place point A at the origin (0, 0). Since AB is 2 units long, and assuming AB is horizontal for simplicity, point B would be at (2, 0). Now, since AB is parallel to CD, then CD must also be horizontal. Let me assume that. 

Now, triangle ABE has points A(0,0), B(2,0), and E somewhere. Let me denote coordinates for E. Let me call E(x,y). Then, the length AE is 3, so sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 3. Also, BE is the line from B(2,0) to E(x,y), and its length is... Well, maybe we can find coordinates for E. But maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since triangle ABE is similar to triangle CDE, and AB || CD, perhaps we can find ratios. Let me think. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k. So AB / CD = k, BE / DE = k, and AE / CE = k. 

We know AB = 2, so CD = AB / k = 2/k. Also, DE = BE * k. But DE is given as 2x - 3. Also, AE = 3, so CE = AE / k = 3/k. 

But how do we relate these variables? Let me see if I can find CE in terms of other known quantities. Since BC = 6, and points B, C, D are connected. Let me think about the quadrilateral BCDE. Since CD is parallel to AB, and BC connects B to C, and CD connects C to D. Maybe we can find coordinates for C and D. 

Wait, earlier I started assigning coordinates. Let me continue with that. Let me fix coordinate system. Let me set A at (0,0), B at (2,0). Let me assume that AB is along x-axis. Now, since AB || CD, then CD is horizontal. Let me suppose that line CD is horizontal. Let me find coordinates for E. Since AE = 3, and E is connected to B via BE. Also, triangle ABE exists. Let me think about coordinates for E. Let me denote E as (p, q). Then, the distance from A(0,0) to E(p,q) is √(p² + q²) = 3. Also, the distance from B(2,0) to E(p,q) is √[(p-2)² + q²]. 

Additionally, since triangle ABE is similar to triangle CDE. Let me think about the coordinates for C and D. Since BC = 6. Point C is connected to B(2,0). Let me assume that point C is somewhere. But without knowing direction, it's tricky. However, since CD is parallel to AB (which is horizontal), then CD is horizontal. So once we find coordinates for C and D, they must lie on a horizontal line. 

Moreover, since quadrilateral BCDE has sides BC, CD, DE, and EB. So after finding coordinates for C, D, and E, we can relate them. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors or parametric equations. But perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider the similarity ratio. 

From the similarity of triangles ABE and CDE, AB/CD = AE/CE = BE/DE. 

We have AB = 2, AE = 3, and DE = 2x - 3. So if I can express CD and CE in terms of x, maybe I can find an equation. 

But how? Let's think about CE. CE is the length from C to E. But we need to relate C to other points. Since BC = 6, and C is connected to D, which is connected to E. 

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and AB is horizontal, then CD is horizontal. So if I can find coordinates for C and D, that might help. Let me proceed with coordinates. 

Assume AB is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates:

A(0,0), B(2,0). Let me assume E is at some point (p, q). Then, AE = 3 → p² + q² = 9. 

Now, BE is the segment from B(2,0) to E(p,q). Let me compute the coordinates of E. However, without more info, maybe I need to use the similarity. 

If triangle ABE ~ triangle CDE, then the ratio of AB to CD is equal to the ratio of AE to CE. Let me denote AB = 2, CD = ?

But CD is part of the quadrilateral BCDE. Let me think about point C. Since BC = 6, and B is at (2,0), then point C lies somewhere such that the distance from B(2,0) to C is 6. Let me suppose that C is at (2 + 6*cosθ, 0 + 6*sinθ), but without knowing θ, it's unclear. However, since CD is parallel to AB (horizontal), then CD is horizontal. Therefore, once we find point C, point D will be horizontally aligned with it. 

But maybe there's a relation between CE and other sides. Let me think again about the similarity. 

Suppose the ratio of similarity is k, so AB/CD = k. Then CD = AB/k = 2/k. Also, AE/CE = k ⇒ CE = AE/k = 3/k. 

But CE is the distance from C to E. How can I express CE? If I can find coordinates for C and E, maybe. 

Alternatively, since CD is horizontal and AB is horizontal, and BC connects B to C, then maybe the vector from B to C is related to the vector from D to ...? Not sure. 

Wait, since CD is parallel to AB, which is horizontal, then CD is horizontal. So if I can determine the y-coordinate of D, it would be same as that of C, since CD is horizontal. 

Alternatively, since BC is connected to C, and CD is horizontal. Let me try to define coordinates for C and D. 

Let me assume that CD is horizontal. Let me suppose that the y-coordinate of C is h, so since CD is horizontal, D will have the same y-coordinate h. Then, the line CD has coordinates C(c_x, h) and D(d_x, h). The length CD is |d_x - c_x|. 

Also, BC is from B(2,0) to C(c_x, h), so the distance BC is 6. Thus:

√[(c_x - 2)^2 + (h - 0)^2] = 6 → (c_x - 2)^2 + h² = 36. 

Now, since CD is horizontal, and D is connected to E. Also, DE is part of the quadrilateral. And E is connected to D. Also, DE has length 2x - 3. 

But how does E relate to D? Since E is part of triangle ABE and also connected to D through line ED. 

Also, triangle CDE has sides CD, DE, and EC. From earlier, CE = 3/k, and CD = 2/k. Also, DE = 2x - 3. 

But also, in triangle CDE, by Pythagoras? No, not necessarily right-angled. However, if we can relate CE and CD with DE via the Law of Cosines or something else. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, the slopes of AB and CD are equal. Since AB is horizontal, CD is horizontal. So slope of AB is zero, slope of CD is zero. 

Another thought: Since AB || CD, then the distance between AB and CD is constant. But how can I use that? 

Alternatively, considering vectors. Vector AB is (2,0) - (0,0) = (2, 0). Vector CD is (d_x - c_x, 0). So since AB || CD, the vector CD must be scalar multiple of AB. So vector CD is (k*2, 0) for some scalar k. Therefore, CD has length |k|*2. Hence, CD = 2|k|. 

But since AB is length 2, and CD is length 2|k|, then the ratio AB/CD = 1/|k|. 

From the similarity of triangles ABE and CDE, AB/CD = AE/CE. So 1/|k| = AE/CE ⇒ CE = |k| * AE. 

But I'm not sure if this helps yet. 

Let me try to think differently. Since triangle ABE ~ triangle CDE, then the ratio of AB to CD is equal to the ratio of AE to CE. Let me denote this ratio as r. So:

AB / CD = AE / CE = r.

Therefore, CD = AB / r = 2/r.

And CE = AE * r = 3r.

Also, from the similarity, BE / DE = r ⇒ DE = BE / r.

But DE is given as 2x - 3. So:

2x - 3 = BE / r.

But BE is the length from B to E. Let me find BE. 

In triangle ABE, we know AB = 2, AE = 3, and BE can be found using the Law of Cosines if we know an angle, but we might not have that. However, since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, and AB corresponds to CD, etc., perhaps there's a relationship between BE and other sides. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then angles involving these lines may be equal. For example, angle at B in triangle ABE corresponds to angle at C in triangle CDE? Not sure. 

Wait, if AB || CD, then the angles formed by the transversal BE would be equal. So angle ABE is equal to angle CDE (corresponding angles). Similarly, angle BAE equals angle DCE. 

This suggests that the triangles are similar by AA similarity. So, since AB || CD, then angle ABE = angle CDE and angle BAE = angle DCE, hence triangles ABE and CDE are similar. 

Thus, the ratio of similarity is AB / CD = AE / CE = BE / DE. 

So let's focus on that. Let me denote AB = 2, AE = 3, DE = 2x - 3. 

Let me write the ratio AB / CD = AE / CE. 

But I need to relate CE to other parts. CE is the length from C to E. How can I find CE? 

Looking at quadrilateral BCDE. It includes BC = 6, CD, DE = 2x - 3, and BE. Also, since CD is parallel to AB, and BC connects to C, which connects to D. 

Perhaps using vectors or coordinates again. Let me go back to coordinates. 

Earlier, I had points A(0,0), B(2,0), and E(p,q) with p² + q² = 9. 

Then, BE is the distance from B(2,0) to E(p,q): √[(p-2)² + q²]. Let me denote this as BE_length. 

Also, CE is the distance from C to E. To find CE, I need coordinates for C. But C is connected to B(2,0) with BC = 6. Let me assume coordinates for C. Let me define C as (2 + 6cosθ, 0 + 6sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. 

Since CD is parallel to AB (horizontal), then D must be located horizontally from C. So if CD is horizontal, then D has the same y-coordinate as C, which is 6sinθ. So coordinates of D would be (something, 6sinθ). Also, since CD is horizontal, the x-coordinate of D depends on the length of CD. 

But CD's length is 2/r, from earlier. But I don't know r yet. 

Alternatively, since CD is horizontal, and D is connected to E. The coordinates of D are (c_x + CD_length, y_C), where CD_length is the length of CD. 

But this seems too vague. Perhaps I need another approach. 

Wait, since AB || CD, and AB is horizontal, then CD is horizontal. So the line CD is horizontal, meaning that the y-coordinates of C and D are the same. Let me call this y-coordinate 'h'. So point C is (c_x, h), point D is (d_x, h). 

The length CD is |d_x - c_x|. 

Also, BC = 6. Since B is at (2,0), and C is at (c_x, h), then:

√[(c_x - 2)^2 + (h - 0)^2] = 6 → (c_x - 2)^2 + h^2 = 36. 

Now, DE is the length from D(d_x, h) to E(p, q). Given that DE = 2x - 3. Also, E is connected to A(0,0) and B(2,0), and AE = 3. 

Let me think about coordinates for E. From earlier, E(p,q) satisfies p² + q² = 9. 

Also, BE is the distance from B(2,0) to E(p,q):

BE = √[(p - 2)^2 + q^2].

Now, since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, and AB || CD, let's try to find relations between these. 

From similarity, AB / CD = AE / CE = BE / DE. 

Let me write AB / CD = AE / CE. So:

2 / CD = 3 / CE → CE = (3/2) CD. 

Similarly, BE / DE = 2 / CD. So BE = (2 / CD) * DE. 

But DE = 2x - 3, so BE = (2 / CD)(2x - 3). 

But I still need to relate CD and CE. 

But CE is the distance from C to E. Coordinates of C are (c_x, h), coordinates of E are (p, q). So CE = √[(p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2]. 

But this seems complex. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then the triangles ABE and CDE are similar, so the ratio of AB to CD is equal to the ratio of AE to CE. Also, since AB || CD, then the heights of the triangles might be related. 

Wait, if AB and CD are parallel, then the height from E to AB might be related to the height from E to CD. But since E is connected to D, which is on CD, maybe the height from E to CD is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then the distance between AB and CD is constant. Let me calculate that distance. The distance between AB (which is along y=0) and CD (which is at y=h) is |h|. 

Now, in triangle ABE, the area can be expressed as (base * height)/2. Taking AB as base, length 2, and height is the vertical distance from E to AB. Since AB is on y=0, the y-coordinate of E is q, so the height is |q|. Therefore, area of ABE is (2 * |q|)/2 = |q|. 

Similarly, in triangle CDE, taking CD as base, length CD, and height is the vertical distance from E to CD. Since CD is at y=h, the vertical distance from E(p,q) to CD is |q - h|. So area of CDE is (CD * |q - h|)/2. 

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So:

Area_ABE / Area_CDE = (AB / CD)^2.

Substituting:

|q| / [(CD * |q - h|)/2] = (2 / CD)^2.

Simplify left side:

2|q| / (CD * |q - h|) = 4 / CD².

Multiply both sides by CD * |q - h|:

2|q| = (4 / CD) * |q - h|.

Hmm, not sure if helpful yet. 

But maybe combining with previous relations. Let me recall that from similarity, CE = (3/2) CD. Also, CE is the distance from C to E, which is √[(p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2]. 

But this seems too many variables. Let me think if there's another way. 

Let me return to the ratio AB/CD = AE/CE. Let me denote CD as m. Then, 2/m = 3/CE ⇒ CE = (3m)/2. 

Also, from the similarity, BE / DE = 2/m ⇒ BE = (2/m)*DE. 

But DE = 2x - 3. So BE = (2/m)(2x - 3). 

Now, can I find BE in another way? Let me think about the coordinates. 

BE is the distance from B(2,0) to E(p,q), which is sqrt[(p-2)^2 + q^2]. 

But I also know that AE = 3, so sqrt[p^2 + q^2] = 3. Squaring, p² + q² = 9. 

So BE² = (p-2)^2 + q^2 = p² -4p +4 + q² = (p² + q²) -4p +4 = 9 -4p +4 = 13 -4p. 

So BE = sqrt(13 -4p). 

But I also have BE = (2/m)(2x -3). So:

sqrt(13 -4p) = (2/m)(2x -3).

But I don't know m or p. This seems stuck. 

Maybe there's another relation involving CE. CE = 3m/2. Also, CE is the distance from C to E. 

Coordinates of C are (c_x, h), and E is (p, q). So CE² = (p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2 = (3m/2)^2 = 9m²/4. 

But I also have from BC = 6:

(c_x - 2)^2 + h² = 36.

And since CD is horizontal, length CD = m = d_x - c_x (assuming d_x > c_x). 

But I don't know d_x. 

But D is connected to E. So DE is the distance from D(d_x, h) to E(p, q), which is sqrt[(p - d_x)^2 + (q - h)^2] = 2x - 3. 

But this introduces more variables. 

It seems like I need to find a way to relate these variables. Perhaps there's a missing piece. Let me think again about the similarity. 

Since AB || CD, and AB is part of triangle ABE while CD is part of triangle CDE, and they're similar. Also, since AB || CD, the corresponding angles are equal. So angle ABE equals angle CDE, and angle BAE equals angle DCE. 

Let me try to apply the Law of Sines or Cosines in the triangles. 

In triangle ABE: 

Using Law of Cosines on angle at E: 

AB² = AE² + BE² - 2 * AE * BE * cos(angle AEB)

But not sure. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe we can find relations. 

Alternatively, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of sides is consistent. Let me assume the ratio is k. So AB/CD = AE/CE = BE/DE = k. 

We have AB = 2, AE = 3, DE = 2x -3. 

Let me write:

AB / CD = AE / CE → 2/CD = 3/CE → CE = (3/2) CD.

Also, BE / DE = 2/CD → BE = (2/CD) * DE = (2/CD)*(2x -3).

Now, let's look at the quadrilateral BCDE. It has sides BC = 6, CD = m (let's say m = CD), DE = 2x -3, and BE. 

But how can I relate these? Maybe through the triangle BCE or something else? 

Wait, point C is connected to B and D. So BC = 6, CD = m, and then D is connected to E. But I don't know anything about CE or BE except what we derived. 

Wait, CE is a diagonal from C to E. Also, from earlier, CE = (3/2)m. 

But CE can also be expressed using the coordinates. If I can relate CE to other known quantities. 

Let me think about the entire configuration. If I can express CE in terms of BC and something else. 

Wait, in the quadrilateral BCDE, if I consider triangle BCE, but I don't know much about it. 

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and BC connects to C, then maybe there's a parallelogram or something. 

Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and BC is connected, maybe ABCD is a trapezoid? But D is connected to E instead of A. 

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find another relation. 

Let me consider that in the similar triangles, the ratio is k = AB / CD = 2/m. Also, from AE / CE = 3/CE = 2/m → CE = (3m)/2. 

But CE is also the length from C to E. Let me consider the coordinates again. 

From earlier, CE² = (p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2 = (3m/2)^2 = 9m²/4. 

Also, from BC = 6, we have (c_x - 2)^2 + h² = 36. 

Also, from CD being horizontal, D is at (c_x + m, h) assuming CD extends to the right. So D is (c_x + m, h). 

Then DE is the distance from D to E, which is sqrt[(p - (c_x + m))^2 + (q - h)^2] = 2x - 3. 

So squaring both sides: 

(p - c_x - m)^2 + (q - h)^2 = (2x - 3)^2. 

But from CE² = (p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2 = 9m²/4. 

Let me expand DE²:

(p - c_x - m)^2 + (q - h)^2 = [ (p - c_x)^2 - 2m(p - c_x) + m² ] + (q - h)^2 = [ (p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2 ] - 2m(p - c_x) + m² = CE² - 2m(p - c_x) + m² = 9m²/4 - 2m(p - c_x) + m² = (9m²/4 + m²) - 2m(p - c_x) = (13m²/4) - 2m(p - c_x). 

But this equals (2x - 3)^2. 

So:

13m²/4 - 2m(p - c_x) = (2x - 3)^2.

But I still have too many unknowns here: m, p, c_x, h. 

However, from the earlier expression for BE² = 13 - 4p. Also, BE = (2/m)(2x - 3). So:

BE² = (4/m²)(2x - 3)^2 = 13 - 4p.

So:

(4/m²)(2x - 3)^2 = 13 - 4p.

But I don't know p. 

This seems too many variables. Let me think if there's another way. 

Wait, maybe I can relate p to other variables. Since E is connected to A and B, and AE = 3. 

From coordinates, AE = sqrt(p² + q²) = 3 → p² + q² = 9. 

Also, from BE² = 13 - 4p. 

But BE is also (2/m)(2x - 3). 

But I need to find another relation. 

Let me try to link CE and other variables. 

From CE = 3m/2, and CE² = 9m²/4. 

But CE² = (p - c_x)^2 + (q - h)^2 = 9m²/4. 

Also, from BC = 6: (c_x - 2)^2 + h² = 36. 

But I don't know c_x or h. 

Maybe I can find a relationship between p and c_x or h? 

Not sure. 

At this point, I feel like I'm stuck with too many variables. Maybe I should try plugging in answer choices and see which one works. 

The question asks for x such that ED = 2x - 3. The answer choices are A.5, B.6, C.8, D.9. 

Let me try each option and see if it fits. 

Let me assume x = 6 (option B). Then ED = 2*6 -3 = 9. 

So DE = 9. 

From similarity, BE / DE = 2/m, and BE = (2/m)*DE = (2/m)*9 = 18/m. 

Also, from earlier, BE² = 13 - 4p. 

But I don't know p. 

Alternatively, let's try to use the ratio from similarity. 

Since AB/CD = AE/CE = 2/m = 3/CE → CE = (3m)/2. 

Also, from the quadrilateral BCDE, CD = m, BC = 6, DE = 9. 

If I can find a relation between these. 

Wait, if I assume that BCDE is a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, then the non-parallel sides are BC and DE. But BC is 6, DE is 9. But in a trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are not necessarily equal. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then the distance between AB and CD is constant. Let me call this distance h. 

In triangle ABE, the height is h_AB = |q|, as before. 

In triangle CDE, the height is |q - h|, where h is the y-coordinate of CD. 

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of heights should be equal to the ratio of sides. 

So, h_AB / h_CD = AB / CD → |q| / |q - h| = 2/m. 

But I don't know q or h. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe there's a simpler approach. 

Let me revisit the similarity. 

Triangles ABE ~ CDE, so AB/CD = AE/CE = BE/DE. 

Let me denote AB = 2, AE = 3, DE = 2x -3. 

Let me assume that AB corresponds to CD, AE corresponds to CE, and BE corresponds to DE. 

So, 2/CD = 3/CE = BE/(2x-3). 

Let me call the ratio k = 2/CD = 3/CE = BE/(2x-3). 

From this, CD = 2/k, CE = 3/k, BE = k*(2x-3). 

Now, let's look at CE. CE is the length from C to E. Also, BC = 6. 

If I can relate CE to BC. Let me think about triangle BCE? 

Wait, C is connected to B and D, but not directly to E. Unless there's a way to express CE in terms of BC and other sides. 

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and AB is 2, CD is 2/k. 

Let me think about the vector approach. Since AB is parallel to CD, then vector AB is proportional to vector CD. 

Vector AB = B - A = (2,0) - (0,0) = (2,0). 

Vector CD = D - C. Since CD is parallel to AB, it must be a scalar multiple of (2,0). Let me say vector CD = t*(2,0) for some scalar t. So D = C + t*(2,0). 

So if C is at (c_x, h), then D is at (c_x + 2t, h). 

Now, the length of CD is |vector CD| = 2t. So CD = 2t, which means from earlier, CD = 2/k → 2t = 2/k → t = 1/k. 

Now, let me consider point E. Since DE is part of the quadrilateral, and D is at (c_x + 2t, h), E is some point such that DE = 2x - 3. 

But how does E relate to other points? 

From triangle ABE, we know AE = 3 and AB = 2. 

Let me try to express E in terms of other points. 

Since E is connected to A and B, and to D. 

Let me assume that E is somewhere in the plane. 

But this is still too vague. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle ABE, AE = 3, AB = 2, and BE is some length. 

Also, in triangle CDE, CD = 2t, DE = 2x - 3, and CE = 3/k. 

But since t = 1/k, then CD = 2/k. 

So CE = 3/k = 3t. 

But CE is the distance from C to E. 

Let me express CE in terms of other variables. 

If I can find CE using coordinates. Let me assume coordinates for C as (c_x, h). Then, D is at (c_x + 2t, h). 

Now, E is some point such that DE = 2x - 3. Let me denote E as (e_x, e_y). 

Then, DE = sqrt[(e_x - (c_x + 2t))² + (e_y - h)^2] = 2x - 3. 

Also, AE = 3: sqrt[(e_x - 0)^2 + (e_y - 0)^2] = 3 → e_x² + e_y² = 9. 

Also, BE is the distance from B(2,0) to E(e_x, e_y): sqrt[(e_x - 2)^2 + e_y²]. 

And from earlier, BE = k*(2x - 3) = (2/CD)*(2x - 3) = (2/(2t))*(2x - 3) = (1/t)*(2x - 3). 

But t = 1/k, and k = 2/CD = 2/(2t) = 1/t. So this checks out. 

But how to relate this to CE? 

CE is the distance from C(c_x, h) to E(e_x, e_y): sqrt[(e_x - c_x)^2 + (e_y - h)^2] = 3t. 

So, (e_x - c_x)^2 + (e_y - h)^2 = 9t². 

But I also have from BC = 6: (c_x - 2)^2 + h^2 = 36. 

This is getting complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between e_x, e_y, c_x, h, t. 

Let me try to combine equations. 

From e_x² + e_y² = 9 (from AE = 3).

From (e_x - c_x)^2 + (e_y - h)^2 = 9t².

Expand the second equation: e_x² - 2c_x e_x + c_x² + e_y² - 2h e_y + h² = 9t².

Substitute e_x² + e_y² = 9: 9 - 2c_x e_x - 2h e_y + c_x² + h² = 9t².

Rearrange: -2c_x e_x - 2h e_y + (c_x² + h²) + 9 = 9t².

But from BC = 6: (c_x - 2)^2 + h² = 36 → c_x² - 4c_x + 4 + h² = 36 → c_x² + h² = 36 + 4c_x - 4 = 32 + 4c_x. 

Substitute into above equation:

-2c_x e_x - 2h e_y + (32 + 4c_x) + 9 = 9t² → -2c_x e_x - 2h e_y + 41 + 4c_x = 9t². 

This seems too complex. 

Maybe I need to find another relationship. Let me think about the position of E. Since E is part of triangle ABE, and DE is part of the quadrilateral. 

Wait, from the similarity, BE/DE = 2/CD = 2/(2t) = 1/t. So BE = DE / t. 

But DE = 2x - 3, so BE = (2x - 3)/t. 

But BE is also the distance from B to E, which we earlier expressed as sqrt(13 - 4p) if E is (p, q). But this might not help. 

At this point, I think I need to make an assumption or find a clever relationship. Let me try to assume that the triangles are similar in a specific way. 

Let me assume that the ratio k is such that AB/CD = 2/m = 3/CE = BE/DE. 

Let me try to express everything in terms of x. 

From DE = 2x - 3, and BE = (2x - 3)/t, where t = 1/k. 

But I also have from the earlier equation involving BE² = 13 - 4p. 

Wait, let me recall that BE² = 13 - 4p, and BE = (2x - 3)/t. So:

( (2x - 3)/t )² = 13 - 4p. 

But I don't know p or t. 

This seems like a dead end. 

Let me try plugging in the answer choices. Let's try option C: x = 8. Then DE = 2*8 - 3 = 13. 

If DE = 13, then from similarity, BE = (2/CD) * DE = (2/CD)*13. 

Also, from AB/CD = 2/CD = 3/CE => CE = (3/2) CD. 

Let me assume CD = m, so CE = 3m/2. 

Now, from BC = 6, CD = m, and DE = 13. 

But how to relate these? Maybe using the law of cosines in some triangle? 

Alternatively, let me assume that in triangle CDE, sides are CD = m, DE = 13, and CE = 3m/2. 

By the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So:

m + 13 > 3m/2 → 13 > 3m/2 - m → 13 > m/2 → m < 26. 

Also, m + 3m/2 > 13 → 5m/2 > 13 → m > 26/5 = 5.2. 

And 13 + 3m/2 > m → 13 > -m/2 → always true. 

So m is between 5.2 and 26. 

But how to find m? 

If I can relate m to BC = 6. 

But I don't see a direct relation. 

Let me try option B: x = 6, DE = 9. 

Then, BE = (2/CD)*9 = 18/CD. 

Also, from AB/CD = 2/CD = 3/CE → CE = 3CD/2. 

Now, in triangle CDE, sides are CD, DE=9, CE=3CD/2. 

Applying triangle inequality:

CD + 9 > 3CD/2 → 9 > 3CD/2 - CD → 9 > CD/2 → CD < 18. 

Also, CD + 3CD/2 > 9 → 5CD/2 > 9 → CD > 18/5 = 3.6. 

And 9 + 3CD/2 > CD → 9 > -CD/2 → always true. 

Still no help. 

Maybe I need to use the fact that in triangle ABE, AB = 2, AE = 3, and BE is some value. Let me use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABE. 

Let me denote angle at A as α, at B as β, and at E as γ. 

By the Law of Cosines: 

BE² = AB² + AE² - 2*AB*AE*cos(angle BAE). 

But I don't know the angle. 

Alternatively, since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, the angles are equal. So angle at E in ABE is equal to angle at E in CDE. 

Wait, in triangle CDE, angle at E is between CD and DE. Since CD is parallel to AB, and DE is a side, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles. 

This is getting too abstract. 

Maybe I should give up and try to assume that the ratio is 2/3, or something. 

Let me assume that the ratio k is 2/3. So AB/CD = 2/CD = 2/3 → CD = 3. 

Then, from similarity, AE/CE = 2/3 → CE = (3/2)*AE = (3/2)*3 = 9/2 = 4.5. 

Also, BE/DE = 2/3 → BE = (2/3)*DE. 

But DE = 2x - 3. So BE = (2/3)(2x -3). 

Also, from triangle ABE, BE can be calculated. 

Using the Law of Cosines in ABE: 

BE² = AB² + AE² - 2*AB*AE*cos(angle at A). 

But I don't know the angle. 

Alternatively, if I assume that the triangles are similar with ratio 2/3, then the sides of CDE are 3, 4.5, and DE. 

But DE = 2x -3. 

But I need to relate DE to other sides. 

If CD = 3, DE = 2x -3, and CE = 4.5. 

In triangle CDE, using the Law of Cosines: 

DE² = CD² + CE² - 2*CD*CE*cos(angle at C). 

But I don't know the angle. 

Alternatively, if the triangles are similar, then all angles are equal. So angle at E in ABE equals angle at E in CDE. 

But this is too vague. 

I think I'm missing a key insight here. Let me try to think about the fact that AB is parallel to CD, and the triangles are similar. 

Since AB || CD, the triangles ABE and CDE are similar, implying that the ratio of AB to CD is the same as the ratio of AE to CE, and BE to DE. 

Let me focus on the ratio of AE to CE. AE is 3, and CE is some value. Also, AB is 2, CD is some value. 

Let me denote AB/CD = AE/CE = 2/CD = 3/CE → CE = (3/2)*CD. 

Now, let me think about the quadrilateral BCDE. It has BC = 6, CD = ?, DE = 2x -3, and BE. 

If I can find CE in terms of BC and CD. 

Wait, if I consider the line CE, which connects C to E. Also, BC = 6, and CD is parallel to AB. 

Maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinates again. 

Let me set A at (0,0), B at (2,0). Let me assume that AB is horizontal. Let me assume that E is at (0,3), making AE = 3. Wait, but then AE would be from (0,0) to (0,3), length 3. Then, BE would be from (2,0) to (0,3), length sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13). 

But then, what about the rest? 

If E is at (0,3), then let me find CD. Since AB || CD, and AB is horizontal, CD must be horizontal. Let me say CD is at some y-coordinate h. 

Point C is connected to B(2,0) with BC = 6. Let me find coordinates for C. Let me assume C is at (2 + 6, 0) = (8,0), but then CD would be horizontal, so D would be at (8 + m, 0). But then DE would be from D(8 + m, 0) to E(0,3). Length DE = sqrt((8 + m - 0)^2 + (0 - 3)^2) = sqrt((8+m)^2 + 9). This should equal 2x -3. 

But also, from similarity, AB/CD = 2/m = 3/CE. CE is the distance from C(8,0) to E(0,3): sqrt((8-0)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(64 + 9) = sqrt(73). 

So 2/m = 3/sqrt(73) → m = 2sqrt(73)/3. 

Then DE = sqrt((8 + m)^2 + 9) = 2x -3. 

Let me compute this:

Let me calculate m = 2sqrt(73)/3 ≈ 2*8.544/3 ≈ 5.696. 

So 8 + m ≈ 13.696. Squared is approximately 187.6. Add 9: 196.6. Square root is approx 14.02. So 2x -3 ≈ 14.02 → 2x ≈ 17.02 → x ≈ 8.51. Closest option is C (8) or D (9). But this is just a guess. 

But this is under the assumption that E is at (0,3), which might not be valid. Because in this case, the triangle ABE has AB=2, AE=3, and BE=sqrt(13). Then, the similarity ratio would be AB/CD = 2/m, and AE/CE = 3/sqrt(73). Setting these equal: 2/m = 3/sqrt(73) → m = 2sqrt(73)/3. 

But this leads to DE ≈ 14.02, so x ≈ 8.51. The closest option is C (8) or D (9). But this is just one possible configuration. 

But since this is just one possibility, and the actual configuration might vary, this approach might not be reliable. 

Alternatively, let me try to find x such that DE = 2x -3 is consistent with the similarity. 

Let me recall that from the similarity, BE/DE = AB/CD = 2/CD. Also, from the triangle ABE, BE can be calculated using the Law of Cosines. 

Let me denote angle at E as θ. Then, in triangle ABE, by the Law of Cosines: 

BE² = AB² + AE² - 2*AB*AE*cosθ. 

But also, in triangle CDE, angle at E is equal to θ (because of similarity), so applying the Law of Cosines there: 

DE² = CD² + CE² - 2*CD*CE*cosθ. 

But from similarity, AB/CD = AE/CE → 2/CD = 3/CE → CE = (3/2)CD. 

Let me substitute CE = (3/2)CD into the second equation:

DE² = CD² + (9/4)CD² - 2*CD*(3/2)CD*cosθ = (13/4)CD² - 3CD² cosθ. 

But from the first equation, BE² = 4 + 9 - 12 cosθ = 13 - 12 cosθ. 

Also, from similarity, BE/DE = 2/CD → BE = (2/CD)*DE. 

Let me square both sides: BE² = (4/CD²)*DE². 

Substitute BE² from first equation: 13 - 12 cosθ = (4/CD²)*DE². 

Now, from the second equation, DE² = (13/4)CD² - 3CD² cosθ. 

Let me substitute DE² into the equation from BE²:

13 - 12 cosθ = (4/CD²)[(13/4)CD² - 3CD² cosθ] = 13 - 12 cosθ. 

Which simplifies to 13 - 12 cosθ = 13 - 12 cosθ. 

This is an identity! So it doesn't give new information. 

This means that our equations are dependent, and we cannot determine CD or x from this alone. 

This suggests that there is infinite solutions unless additional constraints are applied. 

But wait, there is another constraint: BC = 6. How can I incorporate this? 

Let me think about the position of C and D. Since CD is parallel to AB, and BC = 6. 

Let me assume that AB is horizontal, and CD is horizontal. Let me assume that the y-coordinate of CD is h. 

Point B is at (2,0), and point C is somewhere such that BC = 6. Let me assume that C is at (2 + 6, 0) = (8,0), making BC = 6 along the x-axis. Then, CD is horizontal, so D is at (8 + m, 0), where m is the length of CD. 

Now, DE is the distance from D(8 + m, 0) to E. Let me find E. 

From earlier, in this setup, E is such that AE = 3. Let me assume E is at (0,3), making AE = 3. Then, BE is the distance from B(2,0) to E(0,3): sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13). 

Now, from similarity, AB/CD = 2/m = 3/CE. CE is the distance from C(8,0) to E(0,3): sqrt(64 + 9) = sqrt(73). 

So 2/m = 3/sqrt(73) → m = 2sqrt(73)/3 ≈ 5.696. 

Then, DE is the distance from D(8 + m, 0) to E(0,3): sqrt((8 + m)^2 + 9). 

Let me calculate this: 

m = 2sqrt(73)/3 ≈ 5.696, so 8 + m ≈ 13.696. 

Then, (8 + m)^2 + 9 ≈ (13.696)^2 + 9 ≈ 187.6 + 9 = 196.6, so DE ≈ sqrt(196.6) ≈ 14.02. 

So DE = 2x - 3 = 14.02 → 2x = 17.02 → x ≈ 8.51. 

The closest answer choice is C (8) or D (9). Since 8.51 is closer to 9, but let's check if there's another configuration where x is exact. 

Alternatively, maybe my assumption of E's coordinates is incorrect. Let me try a different position for E. 

Let me assume that E is at (2,3), making AE = sqrt(2² + 3²) = sqrt(13). But this contradicts AE = 3. So no. 

Let me try E at (1.5, sqrt(9 - 2.25)) = (1.5, sqrt(6.75)) = (1.5, 2.598). Then, AE = 3. 

Then, BE is from (2,0) to (1.5, 2.598): sqrt(0.5² + 2.598²) ≈ sqrt(0.25 + 6.75) = sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645. 

Then, from similarity, BE/DE = 2/CD. Let me say CD = m, so DE = (BE * CD)/2. 

But DE is also the distance from D to E. 

If CD is parallel to AB, and C is at (2 + 6, 0) = (8,0), then D is at (8 + m, 0). 

So DE is from (8 + m, 0) to (1.5, 2.598): sqrt((8 + m - 1.5)^2 + (0 - 2.598)^2) = sqrt((6.5 + m)^2 + 6.75). 

Setting this equal to (BE * CD)/2 = (sqrt(7) * m)/2. 

So:

(6.5 + m)^2 + 6.75 = (7 * m²)/4. 

Expanding (6.5 + m)^2 = 42.25 + 13m + m². 

So:

42.25 + 13m + m² + 6.75 = (7/4)m² → 49 + 13m + m² = (7/4)m². 

Multiply both sides by 4: 196 + 52m + 4m² = 7m² → 196 + 52m = 3m² → 3m² - 52m - 196 = 0. 

Solving this quadratic: m = [52 ± sqrt(52² + 4*3*196)] / (2*3) = [52 ± sqrt(2704 + 2352)] / 6 = [52 ± sqrt(5056)] / 6. 

Calculate sqrt(5056): 5056 = 16*316 = 16*4*79 = 64*79. So sqrt(5056) = 8*sqrt(79) ≈ 8*8.888 ≈ 71.104. 

So m ≈ (52 + 71.104)/6 ≈ 123.104/6 ≈ 20.517. 

Then DE = (sqrt(7) * m)/2 ≈ (2.645 * 20.517)/2 ≈ 54.25 / 2 ≈ 27.125. 

So 2x - 3 = 27.125 → 2x = 30.125 → x ≈ 15.06, which is not among the options. 

This suggests that depending on the position of E, x varies, which indicates that there's missing information. 

But the problem must have a unique solution, so I must have missed a key constraint. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

Wait, the problem says Quadrilateral BCDE. Is it a parallelogram? Or is there another condition? 

No, it just says Quadrilateral BCDE. Also, the similarity between triangles ABE and CDE. 

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "IsSideOf(Line(C,D), Triangle(C,D,E))". So CD is a side of triangle CDE. So triangle CDE has sides CD, DE, and CE. 

Also, from the similarity, AB/CD = AE/CE = BE/DE. 

Let me try to use the fact that BC = 6 and CD is parallel to AB. 

Let me consider the vector from B to C, which is BC = 6. Since CD is parallel to AB, which is horizontal, then the vector CD is horizontal. 

Let me assume that AB is horizontal, so CD is horizontal. Let me define the coordinates as follows:

A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2 + 6, 0) = (8,0), since BC = 6 and assuming it's along x-axis. Then, CD is horizontal, so D is at (8 + m, 0), where m is CD length. 

Now, E is some point such that AE = 3 and BE is defined. Also, DE = 2x - 3. 

From similarity, AB/CD = 2/m = AE/CE = 3/CE. So CE = 3m/2. 

Also, from the coordinates, CE is the distance from C(8,0) to E. Let me denote E as (p, q). Then:

AE = 3: p² + q² = 9.

BE is distance from B(2,0) to E(p,q): sqrt((p-2)^2 + q^2).

Also, CE is distance from C(8,0) to E: sqrt((p-8)^2 + q^2) = 3m/2. 

From the similarity, BE/DE = 2/m → DE = (m/2) * BE. 

Also, DE is the distance from D(8 + m, 0) to E(p, q): sqrt((p - (8 + m))^2 + q^2) = 2x - 3. 

Now, we have several equations:

1. p² + q² = 9 (AE = 3)
2. (p - 8)^2 + q^2 = (3m/2)^2 (CE = 3m/2)
3. (p - 2)^2 + q^2 = BE² (BE is sqrt(...))
4. (p - (8 + m))^2 + q^2 = (2x - 3)^2 (DE = 2x -3)
5. DE = (m/2) * BE → (2x - 3) = (m/2) * BE → BE = 2(2x -3)/m

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (p - 8)^2 + q^2 - p² - q^2 = (9m²/4) - 9. 

Expand (p - 8)^2 - p² = p² - 16p + 64 - p² = -16p + 64. 

So: -16p + 64 = (9m²/4) - 9 → -16p = (9m²/4) - 9 - 64 = (9m²/4) - 73 → p = (73 - 9m²/4)/16. 

Now, from equation 3, BE² = (p - 2)^2 + q^2. 

But from equation 1, q^2 = 9 - p². So:

BE² = (p - 2)^2 + (9 - p²) = p² - 4p + 4 + 9 - p² = -4p + 13. 

So BE = sqrt(-4p + 13). 

From equation 5, BE = 2(2x -3)/m. So:

sqrt(-4p + 13) = 2(2x -3)/m → squared: -4p + 13 = 4(2x -3)^2/m². 

Now, from earlier, p = (73 - 9m²/4)/16. Let me substitute this into the equation. 

Let me compute -4p + 13:

-4p + 13 = -4 * [(73 - 9m²/4)/16] + 13 = [-4 * 73/16 + (4 * 9m²/4)/16] + 13 = [-73/4 + (9m²)/4] + 13 = (-73/4 + 13) + (9m²)/4 = (-73/4 + 52/4) + (9m²)/4 = (-21/4) + (9m²)/4 = (9m² - 21)/4. 

So, (9m² - 21)/4 = 4(2x -3)^2/m². 

Multiply both sides by m²:

(9m² - 21)/4 * m² = 4(2x -3)^2. 

Simplify left side: (9m^4 - 21m²)/4 = 4(2x -3)^2. 

Now, this is one equation relating m and x. 

But we need another equation to relate m and x. Let's use equation 4. 

From equation 4: (p - (8 + m))^2 + q^2 = (2x -3)^2. 

Expand this: (p - 8 - m)^2 + q^2 = (2x -3)^2. 

Expand (p - 8 - m)^2 = (p - 8)^2 - 2m(p - 8) + m². 

So, (p - 8)^2 - 2m(p - 8) + m² + q^2 = (2x -3)^2. 

From equation 2, (p - 8)^2 + q^2 = 9m²/4. Substitute this into the equation:

9m²/4 - 2m(p - 8) + m² = (2x -3)^2. 

Combine terms: 9m²/4 + m² - 2m(p - 8) = 13m²/4 - 2m(p - 8) = (2x -3)^2. 

Now, let's substitute p from earlier: p = (73 - 9m²/4)/16. 

So, p - 8 = (73 - 9m²/4)/16 - 8 = (73 - 9m²/4 - 128)/16 = (-55 - 9m²/4)/16. 

So, -2m(p - 8) = -2m * (-55 - 9m²/4)/16 = (110m + (9m³)/2)/16. 

Thus, the equation becomes:

13m²/4 + (110m + (9m³)/2)/16 = (2x -3)^2. 

Let me combine the terms. First, convert 13m²/4 to 52m²/16. 

So, total left side: 52m²/16 + 110m/16 + 9m³/32 = (2x -3)^2. 

To combine, let's find a common denominator of 32:

52m²/16 = 104m²/32

110m/16 = 220m/32

9m³/32 remains as is.

So, total left side: (104m² + 220m + 9m³)/32 = (2x -3)^2. 

Thus:

(9m³ + 104m² + 220m)/32 = (2x -3)^2. 

Now, we have two equations:

1. (9m^4 - 21m²)/4 = 4(2x -3)^2 → (9m^4 - 21m²)/4 = 4(2x -3)^2 → (9m^4 - 21m²)/16 = (2x -3)^2. 

2. (9m³ + 104m² + 220m)/32 = (2x -3)^2. 

Set them equal:

(9m^4 - 21m²)/16 = (9m³ + 104m² + 220m)/32. 

Multiply both sides by 32 to eliminate denominators:

2(9m^4 - 21m²) = 9m³ + 104m² + 220m 

Expand left side: 18m^4 - 42m² = 9m³ + 104m² + 220m 

Bring all terms to left side:

18m^4 - 42m² - 9m³ - 104m² - 220m = 0 

Combine like terms:

18m^4 - 9m³ - (42 + 104)m² - 220m = 0 

18m^4 - 9m³ - 146m² - 220m
