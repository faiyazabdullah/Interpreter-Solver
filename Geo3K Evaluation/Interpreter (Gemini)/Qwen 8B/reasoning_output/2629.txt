MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several lines and angles mentioned here. Let me start by understanding the given information step by step.

First, there are three lines l, m, n. It says that line l is parallel to line m, and line l is also parallel to line n. Wait, but if both m and n are parallel to l, then by the transitive property of parallel lines, m must be parallel to n as well. But the problem also states that Parallel(Line(m), Line(n)) explicitly. So that confirms they're all parallel to each other. So lines l, m, n are all parallel. Then there's another line t which intersects all three lines at points B, F, J respectively. So line t is a transversal cutting through these three parallel lines.

Now, the angles mentioned are numbered from 9 to 12, but the question specifically asks about angle 9 and angle 6. Let me note down the given measures:

- Measure of Angle 9 is 75 degrees.
- The sum of measures of Angle 9 and Angle 10 equals 180 degrees.
- Measure of Angle 6 equals Measure of Angle 10.

So our goal is to find the measure of angle 6.

Let me visualize this setup. Since lines l, m, n are all parallel, and line t is a transversal intersecting them. So when a transversal cuts through parallel lines, it creates various angles. Depending on the position of the intersection points (B, F, J), different angles will form.

But since there are multiple angles labeled 9 through 12, I need to figure out how they relate. However, without seeing the diagram, I need to infer based on standard configurations.

Assuming that point B is the intersection of line l and t, F for line m and t, and J for line n and t. So line t crosses each of the three parallel lines, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc.

Since angle 9 is measured as 75 degrees. Let me think about where angle 9 could be located. If angle 9 is formed at one of the intersections, say at point B, F, or J. Also, the sum of angle 9 and angle 10 is 180, so they might be supplementary angles. That would mean they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair, or maybe consecutive interior angles?

Wait, if two lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. But since lines l, m, n are all parallel, then if line t is the transversal, then consecutive interior angles would be supplementary.

Alternatively, angle 9 and angle 10 could be vertical angles? No, because vertical angles are equal. But their sum is 180, so that can't be unless each is 90, but angle 9 is 75, so that's not possible.

Therefore, angle 9 and angle 10 must be supplementary. Therefore, they are either consecutive interior angles or same-side exterior angles. Let me consider that.

Suppose angle 9 is an angle formed at one intersection, say at point B (intersection of l and t). Then angle 10 could be an angle at another intersection, such as at point F (intersection of m and t). Since lines l and m are parallel, and t is a transversal, the consecutive interior angles would be on the same side of the transversal. For example, if angle 9 is inside the parallel lines l and m, then angle 10 might be another interior angle on the same side. But wait, since there are three lines, maybe angle 9 and angle 10 are on different pairs of parallel lines?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 9 and angle 10 are same-side exterior angles? Or maybe they are supplementary due to being on a straight line.

Another possibility: angle 9 and angle 10 are adjacent angles along the transversal t. For instance, if you look at the intersection points, the angles around each point add up to 180 degrees. For example, at point B, the angles formed by line l and t would include some angles. Suppose angle 9 is one of those angles, and angle 10 is another angle adjacent to it, making a linear pair. In that case, their sum would be 180 degrees. But then angle 10 would be 180 - 75 = 105 degrees. Then, according to the third condition, angle 6 equals angle 10, so angle 6 would be 105 degrees. Which would correspond to option D.

But wait, let me check again. Let me make sure that angle 9 and angle 10 are indeed supplementary. Given that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)),MeasureOf(Angle(10))) equals 180. So yes, they are supplementary. Now, why are they supplementary? Because they could be consecutive interior angles, or maybe same-side exterior angles, or just adjacent angles forming a straight line.

If angle 9 is on one side of the transversal, and angle 10 is on the other side, but since the lines are parallel, maybe they are related via some theorem.

But considering that lines l, m, n are all parallel, and t is a transversal. Let me imagine the configuration. Let me sketch mentally:

Imagine three horizontal parallel lines l, m, n, with line t crossing them from top-left to bottom-right, intersecting l at B, m at F, and n at J. Then, at each intersection, there are angles formed.

For example, at point B (on line l), the angles formed by line t would be angles like the ones between l and t. Similarly at F and J. 

Now, suppose angle 9 is one of the angles at point B, say, the angle between line l and t on one side. Then, angle 10 could be an angle at point F, on the same side of t. Since lines l and m are parallel, the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Wait, but here, if angle 9 is at l and t, and angle 10 is at m and t, then those two angles would be consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. Thus, angle 9 + angle 10 = 180. Which matches the given condition. So angle 10 would be 180 - 75 = 105 degrees. Then, since measure of angle 6 equals measure of angle 10, angle 6 is 105 degrees. Hence, answer D.

But wait, why is angle 6 equal to angle 10? How do we know that angle 6 corresponds to angle 10?

Perhaps angle 6 is another angle that's congruent to angle 10. Since lines l, m, n are parallel, and t is a transversal, certain angles are congruent. For example, if angle 10 is an interior angle on one side, then there might be corresponding angles elsewhere.

But without knowing exactly where angle 6 is located, it's hard to tell. However, the problem gives us that measure of angle 6 equals measure of angle 10. So if angle 10 is 105 degrees, then angle 6 is also 105 degrees. So that would lead us to answer D.

But let me double-check. Another possibility: angle 9 could be an exterior angle, and angle 10 an interior angle, but their sum being 180. Wait, but if they are supplementary, they could be same-side exterior or interior angles. Alternatively, angle 9 could be an exterior angle and angle 10 an interior angle, but that depends on their positions.

Alternatively, maybe angle 9 and angle 10 are vertical angles? No, because vertical angles are equal. But here their sum is 180. Unless they are right angles, but since angle 9 is 75, that's not possible.

So going back, the most plausible scenario is that angle 9 and angle 10 are consecutive interior angles, thus supplementary. So angle 10 is 105 degrees, then angle 6 is equal to angle 10, so 105. So answer D.

Looking at the answer choices, D is 105. So that seems correct. But let me think again if there's another way.

Wait, what if angle 9 is an angle formed at the intersection of line t with line l, and angle 10 is an angle formed at the intersection of line t with line m. But depending on whether they are on the same side or opposite sides.

For example, if angle 9 is an acute angle at point B (intersection of l and t), then angle 10 could be the obtuse angle at point F (intersection of m and t) on the same side of t. Then, since l || m, those two angles would be supplementary. Hence, angle 9 + angle 10 = 180. So angle 10 = 180 - 75 = 105. Then angle 6 equals angle 10, so angle 6 is 105. Hence, answer D.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. 105 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 6$, we begin by analyzing the relationships among the lines and angles described in the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We are given three **parallel lines** $l$, $m$, and $n$, and a **transversal line** $t$ that intersects all three lines. This means:

- Lines $l$, $m$, and $n$ are all **parallel**, i.e., never meet and maintain constant distance apart.
- Line $t$ acts as a **transversal**, intersecting these lines at distinct points:  
  - Point $B$: Intersection of $l$ and $t$  
  - Point $F$: Intersection of $m$ and $t$  
  - Point $J$: Intersection of $n$ and $t$

This setup forms several angles at these points of intersection.

---

### **Step 2: Interpreting the Given Angles**

From the problem statement, we are told:

- $\text{Measure of } \angle 9 = 75^\circ$
- $\text{Sum of } \angle 9 \text{ and } \angle 10 = 180^\circ$
- $\text{Measure of } \angle 6 = \text{Measure of } \angle 10$

We are asked to find the measure of $\angle 6$.

---

### **Step 3: Using the Given Relationships**

#### **a) From the first relationship:**
$$
\angle 9 + \angle 10 = 180^\circ
$$
Substitute $\angle 9 = 75^\circ$:
$$
75^\circ + \angle 10 = 180^\circ \Rightarrow \angle 10 = 105^\circ
$$

#### **b) From the second relationship:**
$$
\angle 6 = \angle 10 \Rightarrow \angle 6 = 105^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verifying the Geometry**

The key insight lies in recognizing that **$\angle 9$ and $\angle 10$** are **consecutive interior angles** formed by the transversal $t$ intersecting the parallel lines $l$ and $m$. Consecutive interior angles are always **supplementary** when the lines are parallel, which explains why their sum is $180^\circ$.

Thus, $\angle 9$ and $\angle 10$ are on the **same side** of the transversal and lie between the two parallel lines $l$ and $m$. Their sum being $180^\circ$ aligns perfectly with this geometric property.

Additionally, since $\angle 6 = \angle 10$, and we've determined that $\angle 10 = 105^\circ$, it follows directly that:

$$
\angle 6 = 105^\circ
$$

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
