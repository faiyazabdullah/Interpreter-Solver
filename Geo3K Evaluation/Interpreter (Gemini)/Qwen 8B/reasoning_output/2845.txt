====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have several points and lines with some angles labeled from 1 to 9. The goal is to find the measure of angle 9, given that angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, and angle 3 is 26°. 

First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given information. Let me note down all the given elements:

Points: A, B, C, D, E. Lines connecting them as follows:
- AB (Line(A,B))
- BE (Line(B,E))
- BC (Line(B,C))
- EC (Line(E,C))
- CD (Line(C,D))
- EA (Line(E,A))

Angles mentioned: Angle(1) to Angle(9). Also, there are some parallel lines: Line AB is parallel to Line EC. Then there are various equalities and sums involving these angles. 

Let me list out the given angle measures:
- MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 58°
- MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 47°
- MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 26°

Also, some relationships between angles:
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))) → so Angle 1 = Angle 6
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(5))) → Angle 2 = Angle 5
- Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), 180) → So Angle3 + Angle5 + Angle4 = 180°
- Add(MeasureOf(Angle(7)), MeasureOf(Angle(6)), MeasureOf(Angle(8)), 180) → Angle7 + Angle6 + Angle8 = 180°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(8)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))) → Angle8 = Angle4
- Add(MeasureOf(Angle(9)), MeasureOf(Angle(7)), MeasureOf(Angle(8)), 180) → Angle9 + Angle7 + Angle8 = 180°

So, first, since Angle1 = 58°, then Angle6 is also 58°. Similarly, Angle2 = 47°, so Angle5 is 47°. 

Now, looking at the third equation: Angle3 + Angle5 + Angle4 = 180. We know Angle3 is 26°, Angle5 is 47°, so adding those gives 26 + 47 = 73. Therefore, Angle4 = 180 - 73 = 107°. Wait, but wait, the sum is 26 + 47 + Angle4 = 180? Wait no, the instruction says "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), 180)" which probably means that their sum equals 180. So yes, 26 + 47 + Angle4 = 180. So Angle4 = 180 - 26 -47 = 107°. 

Then, from the fourth equation, Angle7 + Angle6 + Angle8 = 180. But Angle6 is 58°, and Angle8 equals Angle4, which is 107°. Therefore, substituting:

Angle7 + 58 + 107 = 180 → Angle7 + 165 = 180 → Angle7 = 15°. 

Wait, but then the last equation says Angle9 + Angle7 + Angle8 = 180. Since Angle8 is 107°, and Angle7 is 15°, then:

Angle9 + 15 + 107 = 180 → Angle9 + 122 = 180 → Angle9 = 58°. 

But wait, that would make Angle9 equal to 58°, which is option D. However, let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the equations. Let me go through each step again carefully.

Starting over:

Given:

Angle1 = 58°, so Angle6 = 58° (since they are equal).

Angle2 = 47°, so Angle5 = 47°.

Third equation: Angle3 + Angle5 + Angle4 = 180. Substituting known values:

26° + 47° + Angle4 = 180 → 73° + Angle4 = 180 → Angle4 = 107°. Correct.

Fourth equation: Angle7 + Angle6 + Angle8 = 180. Since Angle6 is 58°, and Angle8 equals Angle4 (from the fifth condition: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(8)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)))), so Angle8 = 107°. Thus:

Angle7 + 58 + 107 = 180 → Angle7 + 165 = 180 → Angle7 = 15°. That seems right.

Then the sixth equation: Angle9 + Angle7 + Angle8 = 180. Substitute Angle7=15°, Angle8=107°:

Angle9 + 15 + 107 = 180 → Angle9 + 122 = 180 → Angle9 = 58°. Which is option D. 

But wait, that's straightforward. But why does the problem mention triangles B,C,E and C,D,E? Maybe there's more to it?

Wait, maybe I missed something. For example, the fact that line AB is parallel to line EC. Perhaps there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles involved. Because if two lines are parallel, then certain angles might be equal. 

But according to the given data, we already used the equations provided. However, maybe there are other relations that can help confirm or adjust the values. Let me think about the structure of the figure.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, B connected to E, C. Let me see:

Lines:

AB, BE, BC, EC, CD, EA.

So, triangle BCE is formed by points B, C, E. Also, triangle CDE is formed by C, D, E. Also, line CD connects to D. And EA connects back to A.

Since AB || EC, which could mean that when considering transversal lines, there are some angle relations. For instance, if AB || EC, then maybe angles formed by a transversal like BE or AE could be related. 

For example, consider line BE intersecting AB and EC. If AB || EC, then angle at B (maybe angle between AB and BE) and angle at E (between EC and BE) could be supplementary or equal depending on the transversal. 

But perhaps we need to use that for another relation. However, according to the given equations, we already derived Angle9 as 58°, which is same as Angle1. But maybe there's a different way to compute it using the parallel lines?

Alternatively, maybe my initial approach was missing something. Let me check again. 

Another possibility: maybe the angles in the triangles need to be considered. For example, Triangle B, C, E. In that triangle, angles at B, C, E. Similarly, Triangle C, D, E. 

But how do these relate to the given angles? For example, angle at point B in triangle BCE would be angle EBC. Similarly, angle at E would be angle BEC. But how does this connect to the given angles?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 is part of triangle ABC or something else. Wait, the labels of angles 1-9 aren't specified, but based on the given equations, perhaps angle1 is related to some specific angle. 

Wait, the problem mentions that Angle(1) is measured as 58, and that it's equal to Angle(6). Similarly, Angle(2)=47 equals Angle(5). But without knowing which angles correspond to which positions, it's challenging. However, the equations given may have already accounted for these relations. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption that Angle4 is 107° is incorrect? Let me check again:

Third equation: Add(Angle3, Angle5, Angle4, 180) → meaning Angle3 + Angle5 + Angle4 = 180. Given Angle3 is 26, Angle5 is 47, so 26+47=73. 180-73=107. Yes, that's correct.

Then, Angle8 equals Angle4, so Angle8 is 107°. 

Then, the fourth equation: Add(Angle7, Angle6, Angle8, 180) → Angle7 + 58 + 107 = 180 → 165 + Angle7 = 180 → Angle7=15°. 

Then the final equation: Add(Angle9, Angle7, Angle8, 180) → Angle9 + 15 + 107 = 180 → Angle9=58. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. But let me check if there's a possible error in assuming that Angle8 equals Angle4 directly. 

The given condition is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(8)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))), so yes, Angle8 = Angle4. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship due to the parallel lines? Let's think. 

If AB is parallel to EC, then maybe there are some vertical angles or corresponding angles. For example, suppose there is a transversal cutting AB and EC. Let's say line BE intersects AB and EC. Then, the angles formed at B and E would be related. 

For instance, angle at B between AB and BE (which could be angle ABE) and angle at E between EC and BE (angle BEC) would be consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle ABE + angle BEC = 180°. 

But unless we know which angles these are, it's hard to apply. However, if angle1 is one of these angles. Let me assume that angle1 is angle ABE. Let me try to imagine:

Suppose angle1 is angle ABE. Then, since AB || EC, angle ABE and angle BEC are supplementary. So angle ABE (which is 58°) plus angle BEC = 180. Hence angle BEC = 180 - 58 = 122°. 

But angle BEC is part of triangle BEC. In triangle BEC, angles are at B, E, and C. So angle at E is angle BEC = 122°, angle at B is angle EBC, and angle at C is angle ECB. Summing up to 180. 

But angle EBC could be angle2 or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe angle2 relates to angle EBC. 

Alternatively, if angle2 is angle EBC. Given angle2 is 47°, so angle EBC = 47°. Then in triangle BEC, angles are 47° at B, 122° at E, so angle at C would be 180 - 47 - 122 = 11°. But angle at C in triangle BEC is angle ECB. 

But then, angle ECB is 11°, which could be angle3 or something else? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe angle3 is angle ECB. But angle3 is given as 26°, which conflicts with this. So maybe my assumption about which angles correspond to which labels is wrong. 

This suggests that perhaps my previous calculation leading to angle9 being 58° is correct, but there's another path via the parallel lines. However, since the problem provides explicit equations between the angles, perhaps those equations are sufficient. 

But let's check again. Suppose angle1 is 58°, which is angle ABE. Then angle BEC is 122°, as per parallel lines. Then, in triangle BEC, angles are 47° (at B?), 122° (at E), and angle at C. Let me call that angle ECB = x. Then 47 + 122 + x = 180 → x = 11°. So angle ECB = 11°. 

But angle3 is given as 26°, which could be another angle. Maybe angle3 is angle ECD or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle3 is part of triangle CDE. Since there's a triangle CDE. If angle3 is angle DCE, then in triangle CDE, angles at C, D, E. 

But without knowing which angles are which, it's difficult. However, according to the earlier equations, we had angle3 + angle5 + angle4 = 180. So angle3 is 26, angle5 is 47, angle4 is 107. 

But angle4 could be angle ECD or something else. 

However, regardless of that, the equations given seem to lead us to angle9 being 58. But the answer choices include D as 58. However, sometimes problems have tricks. Let me verify once more. 

Another thought: maybe angle9 is part of triangle CDE or another triangle. For example, if angle9 is angle CED or something. 

Alternatively, maybe angle7 and angle8 are parts of other triangles. 

But given the equations, even if there are other relations, the equations provided are supposed to be used. So according to the given equations, angle9 = 58°, which is option D. 

But why is there an option C (49)? Could there be an error in my reasoning? Let me recheck:

Angle3 + angle5 + angle4 = 180. Given angle3 = 26, angle5 = 47. So 26 + 47 = 73, so angle4 = 107. 

Then angle8 = angle4 = 107. 

Then angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180. angle6 is 58, angle8 is 107. So angle7 = 180 - 58 - 107 = 15. 

Then angle9 + angle7 + angle8 = 180. So angle9 = 180 - 15 - 107 = 58. 

Yes, that's correct. So angle9 is 58°, which is option D. 

But maybe I'm missing a key detail. For example, maybe angle4 isn't 107°, but something else. Let me think again. 

Wait, the third equation says "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), 180)". Does that mean that the sum of these three angles is 180? Or is there a typo and it should be Add(..., ...), but the syntax might imply something else? Like, maybe it's a sum of three angles equals 180. 

Assuming that, then yes, angle4 = 107. 

Alternatively, if the third equation meant something else, like angle3 + angle5 = angle4, but that wouldn't make sense with the wording. The original statement says "Add(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), 180)", which likely translates to angle3 + angle5 + angle4 = 180. 

Thus, I think my calculation is correct, and angle9 is 58°, which is option D. 

But let me check if there's a possibility that angle7 is not 15°. For example, if angle7 is part of a different triangle. 

But according to the fourth equation, angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180. Angle6 is 58, angle8 is 107, so angle7 = 15. 

Unless there's another relationship that affects angle7. 

Alternatively, maybe angle7 is part of triangle CDE. For example, in triangle CDE, angles are at C, D, E. If angle7 is one of those. But without knowing which angle corresponds to which label, it's hard to tell. 

But given that the equations are provided, we don't need to rely on the diagram's specifics. The equations are given, so we can proceed algebraically. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. 

But just to ensure, let me check if there's any alternative interpretation of the equations. For example, if "Add(A, B, C, 180)" means A + B + C = 180, which is standard. 

So, yes. 

Hence, Final Answer: D.

- **∠1 = ∠6**  
- **∠2 = ∠5**  
- **∠3 + ∠5 + ∠4 = 180°**  
- **∠7 + ∠6 + ∠8 = 180°**  
- **∠8 = ∠4**  
- **∠9 + ∠7 + ∠8 = 180°**

These equations define direct numerical and functional relationships between the angles.

### **Step 2: Use Direct Relationships**

#### From ∠1 = ∠6:
$$
\text{∠6} = 58^\circ
$$

#### From ∠2 = ∠5:
$$
\text{∠5} = 47^\circ
$$

#### Plug into ∠3 + ∠5 + ∠4 = 180°:
$$
26^\circ + 47^\circ + \angle 4 = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 73^\circ = 107^\circ
$$

#### From ∠8 = ∠4:
$$
\angle 8 = 107^\circ
$$

#### Plug into ∠7 + ∠6 + ∠8 = 180°:
$$
\angle 7 + 58^\circ + 107^\circ = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 165^\circ = 15^\circ
$$

#### Finally, plug into ∠9 + ∠7 + ∠8 = 180°:
$$
\angle 9 + 15^\circ + 107^\circ = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle 9 = 180^\circ - 122^\circ = 58^\circ
$$
