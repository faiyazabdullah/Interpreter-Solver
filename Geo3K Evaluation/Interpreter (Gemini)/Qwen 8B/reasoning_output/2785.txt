Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle C with several points on it: G, K, J, H, L. There are lines connecting some of these points, intersecting at point L. Also, there are arcs mentioned: Arc(K,J) which measures 97 degrees, and Arc(G,H) which is x. The angle at point L, Angle(H,L,J), is given as 110 degrees. We need to find x.

First, I remember that when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Let me confirm that theorem. Yes, the formula is: If two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In this case, the lines KH and GJ intersect at point L. So, angle H L J is formed by those two chords. Therefore, according to the theorem, the measure of angle H L J should be (arc KJ + arc GH)/2. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(H,L,J)) is 110 degrees, and MeasureOf(Arc(K,J)) is 97 degrees, and MeasureOf(Arc(G,H)) is x. So plugging into the formula:

110 = (97 + x)/2

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 2:

220 = 97 + x

Subtract 97 from both sides:

x = 220 - 97

Calculating that, 220 minus 97. Let me do the subtraction: 220 - 90 is 130, then subtract 7 more gives 123. Wait, so x would be 123? But looking at the answer choices, D is 123. However, wait, let me check again because sometimes angles can be reflex angles or something else?

Wait, but arcs in circles are typically considered as less than 180 degrees unless specified otherwise. But maybe here they could be major arcs? Wait, but the problem says Arc(K,J) is 97 degrees, which is less than 180, so that's a minor arc. Similarly, Arc(G,H) is x. But since angle formed by two chords is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So if the angle is 110, then the sum of arcs is 220. Since 97 + x = 220, x=123. But 123 is more than 180? Wait no, 123 is less than 180? No, 123 is less than 180. Wait 123 is less than 180. Wait 123 is less than 180? Yes, 123 is less than 180. So that would make sense. Because the intercepted arcs are each less than 180. But wait, if the angle was formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. Wait, but maybe I need to visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points G, H, J, K on the circle. Lines KH and GJ intersect at L inside the circle. Then angle at L is between segments HL and JL. The intercepted arcs would be arc KJ and arc GH. Wait, how does that work? Let me think. When two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, angle formed by chords KL and GL intercepts arcs... Hmm, perhaps arc KJ and arc GH. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact theorem.

Yes, the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, in this case, angle at L is formed by chords LH and LJ. Wait, but the lines are KH and GJ. So line KH connects K and H; line GJ connects G and J. Their intersection is at L. So angle at L is between lines LH and LJ. Wait, but the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, the angle at L intercepts arc KJ and arc GH. Because line KH intercepts arc KJ (since K and J are endpoints?), Wait no. Wait, line KH is a chord from K to H, so that chord intercepts arc KH. Similarly, line GJ intercepts arc GJ. Wait, but the angle formed at L is between the two chords KH and GJ. So the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. Wait, maybe the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles formed by the intersecting chords. 

Alternatively, another way: when two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if you have chords AB and CD intersecting at E, then angle AEC is half (arc AC + arc BD). Wait, but in our case, the chords are KH and GJ. So their intersection is L. Then angle at L would be half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. So angle HLG (if that's the angle) would be half the sum of arcs HG and KJ. Wait, maybe?

Wait, let me get precise. Suppose we have two chords, say, KH and GJ intersecting at L. Then, angle at L is between the chords LH and LG? Or between LH and LJ? Wait, the angle given is angle H L J, meaning vertex at L, with segments LH and LJ. So that angle is formed by the lines LH and LJ. Now, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite this angle. So, when two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. In this case, the intercepted arcs would be arc HK and arc GJ? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

When two chords intersect inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. So, for angle H L J, the two chords are LH (part of KH) and LJ (part of GJ). So, the intercepted arcs would be arc from H to J passing through the side opposite the angle, and arc from K to G? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arcs are arc KG and arc HJ? Not sure. Maybe I need to use the formula. Let me look up the exact theorem. Well, since I can't actually look it up, I'll rely on my memory. 

The key idea is that the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if two chords intersect at L, then the angle at L is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two pairs of vertical angles. For instance, if the chords are AB and CD intersecting at L, then angle ALD is half (arc AD + arc BC). 

So applying that to our case, the two chords are KH and GJ intersecting at L. The angle at L is angle H L J. Which is between segment LH and LJ. So, the intercepted arcs would be arc from H to J (the arc that's not containing L) and arc from K to G? Or maybe arc from H to J and arc from K to G? Wait, not sure. Wait, perhaps the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. 

Wait, chord KH intercepts arc KH, and chord GJ intercepts arc GJ. But when they cross at L, the angle formed would be related to the arcs that are opposite. Wait, maybe the angle is half the sum of the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the angle is half the sum of the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. So, for example, if two chords intersect, creating four angles. Each pair of vertical angles intercepts different arcs. 

But maybe there's a simpler way. Given that angle H L J is given as 110 degrees. According to the theorem, this angle equals half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be arc KJ and arc GH. Wait, why? Because the lines are KH and GJ. So, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, when you have chords KH and GJ intersecting at L, the angle at L is formed by the two chords. The intercepted arcs would be arc from K to J (which is given as 97 degrees) and arc from G to H (which is x). 

Therefore, using the formula:

measure of angle = (arc KJ + arc GH)/2

Which gives us:

110 = (97 + x)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

220 = 97 + x

Then x = 220 - 97 = 123

So x is 123, which corresponds to option D.

But wait, the answer choices include D as 123. So the answer would be D. But let me check again. Is there any possibility that the intercepted arcs are different?

Suppose instead that the intercepted arcs were arc K to H and arc G to J? But then we wouldn't know their measures. But in the problem statement, we are told that Arc(K,J) is 97 degrees. So that's arc from K to J. And Arc(G,H) is x. So if the intercepted arcs are arc KJ and arc GH, then yes, adding them together gives 97 + x. Hence, solving gives x = 123. That seems right.

Another thought: Could the angle be half the difference of the arcs instead? Like if the angle was outside the circle? But no, the angle is formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, so it's definitely the average of the intercepted arcs. So I think my calculation is correct.

Thus, the value of x is 123, so the answer is D.
