====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram MNPQ. The question says that angle M is 10x and angle N is 20x. We need to find the measure of angle M. The answer choices are A through D, which are 30, 45, 60, and 120 respectively.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, so if angle M and angle N are consecutive angles, then their sum should be 180 degrees? Let me confirm that.

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So yes, angle M and angle N are adjacent because in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are next to each other. Therefore, angle M + angle N = 180 degrees. 

But according to the problem, measure of angle M is 10x and measure of angle N is 20x. So adding those together gives 10x + 20x = 30x. And this equals 180 degrees. So 30x = 180. Solving for x would give x = 6. Then, substituting back into angle M, which is 10x, gives 10*6=60 degrees. So angle M would be 60 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 60. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, but hold on. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle M is equal to angle P, and angle N is equal to angle Q. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle M is 10x and angle N is 20x, then since they are consecutive, their sum is 180. So 10x + 20x = 30x = 180, leading to x=6. Then angle M is 10x=60 degrees. That seems straightforward. But why is there an option D as 120? Maybe I made a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe angle M and angle N are not consecutive? Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the order of the vertices matters. If it's M, N, P, Q, then the sides are MN, NP, PQ, QM. So the angles at M and N are adjacent. Because after M comes N, so angle M is between sides MN and MQ, and angle N is between sides NM and NP. So yes, they are adjacent angles. Hence, supplementary. Therefore, my previous calculation holds.

So angle M is 60 degrees, which is option C. However, sometimes people might confuse whether angle M and angle N could be opposite angles. But in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. If angle M were opposite angle N, then they would be equal, but here they are given as 10x and 20x, which would only be possible if 10x=20x, implying x=0, which isn't possible. Therefore, angle M and N must be consecutive angles, hence supplementary. Thus, solving 30x=180 gives x=6, so angle M is 60 degrees. So answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, depending on how the parallelogram is labeled. For example, if the points are ordered such that M and N are opposite? No, because in a parallelogram, the order is such that consecutive vertices are connected. So M connected to N connected to P connected to Q connected to M. So angle M is at vertex M, between sides QM and MN. Angle N is at vertex N, between sides MN and NP. Therefore, consecutive. Therefore, supplementary. So my initial conclusion still stands. Therefore, answer is C, 60 degrees. So the correct answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle M$ in the parallelogram $MNPQ$, we begin by analyzing the key geometric properties of a **parallelogram**:

---

### **Key Properties of a Parallelogram**
1. **Opposite angles are equal**:  
   $$
   \angle M = \angle P,\quad \angle N = \angle Q
   $$

2. **Consecutive (adjacent) angles are supplementary**:  
   $$
   \angle M + \angle N = 180^\circ
   $$

3. **Sum of interior angles** in a quadrilateral is always $360^\circ$.  

---

### **Given Information**
- $\angle M = 10x$
- $\angle N = 20x$

From property (2), since $\angle M$ and $\angle N$ are **consecutive** angles in a parallelogram:
$$
\angle M + \angle N = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the expressions for the angles:
$$
10x + 20x = 180^\circ \\
30x = 180^\circ
$$

Solving for $x$:
$$
x = \frac{180}{30} = 6
$$

Now substitute $x = 6$ into $\angle M = 10x$:
$$
\angle M = 10 \times 6 = 60^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**
The measure of $\angle M$ is $60^\circ$. This matches **option C**.

\text{Final Answer: C}
