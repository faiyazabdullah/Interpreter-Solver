====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P, and several points on it: K, J, L, N, M. The problem says that angle MPL is 65 degrees, and NP is perpendicular to PL. We need to find the measure of arc NM.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since all these points are on the circle centered at P, that means PK, PJ, PL, PN, PM are all radii of the circle. Wait, but actually, since P is the center, then any line from P to another point on the circle would be a radius. But wait, the points K, J, L, N, M are on the circle, so lines like KP, JP, LP, etc., are radii. 

Now, the angles mentioned here are angles at point P. For example, angle MPL is formed by points M, P, L. Since P is the vertex, that makes sense. Also, NP is perpendicular to PL. That means the lines NP and PL form a right angle at point P. So angle NPL is 90 degrees. 

Given that, maybe we can use properties related to central angles and inscribed angles? Let me think. Central angles correspond to arcs equal in measure to their subtended arcs. Inscribed angles are half the measure of their subtended arcs. But here, angle NPL is a central angle because P is the center. Wait, no—wait, angle NPL has vertex at P, which is the center, so yes, it's a central angle. Therefore, the measure of angle NPL equals the measure of arc NL. But wait, the problem says that NP is perpendicular to PL, so angle NPL is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc NL would be 90 degrees. 

But we also know that angle MPL is 65 degrees. That angle is at point P as well. So angle MPL is a central angle, meaning it corresponds to arc ML. So measure of arc ML is 65 degrees. 

Wait, but how does that relate to arc NM? The question asks for the measure of arc NM. Hmm. Maybe there's a way to find the relationship between these arcs. Let me draw a rough diagram mentally. Points M, N, L are on the circle, with P as the center. Let me consider the positions:

Since angle NPL is 90 degrees (central angle), arc NL is 90 degrees. Then angle MPL is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. Now, perhaps we need to find arc NM. If we can figure out the relationship between arcs ML, NL, and NM.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle NPM? Wait, but we might need to look at the sum of certain angles. Wait, the problem mentions adding MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) + MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)) = MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)). Wait, but Angle(N,P,L) is 90 degrees. And MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)) is 65 degrees. So according to the given, adding MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) and 65 gives 90. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) is 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. 

So angle NPM is 25 degrees. But angle NPM is a central angle, so its measure equals the measure of arc NM. Therefore, arc NM would be 25 degrees. Hence, the answer is A. 25.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that Add(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L))). Wait, but the original statement says that Add(Angle(N,P,M) + Angle(M,P,L)) equals Angle(N,P,L). Wait, but the user wrote:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)))"

Wait, maybe that was a typo. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says:

"Angle(N,P,M)
Add(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)))
Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(N,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)))"

Wait, maybe the actual intended meaning is that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) and MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L))? Because the original problem says:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)))" — perhaps that's supposed to mean that the sum of those two angles equals the third?

But the exact wording in the problem says:

"Add(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)))" — maybe this is indicating that the sum of the first two equals the third? Or perhaps it's a mistake. However, in the problem description, there's also:

"MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) + MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)) = MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L))", which would make sense. Given that Angle(N,P,L) is 90 degrees, and Angle(M,P,L) is 65 degrees, then MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) would be 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. 

Therefore, angle NPM is 25 degrees. Since angle NPM is a central angle, it equals the measure of arc NM. Therefore, arc NM is 25 degrees, making the answer A. 

Another way to think about it: In triangle NPM, since P is the center, PN and PM are both radii. Therefore, triangle NPM is an isosceles triangle with sides PN=PM. However, angle at P is 25 degrees. But that's not directly helpful unless we need more info. Alternatively, considering the entire circle. 

Alternatively, since arc NL is 90 degrees, arc ML is 65 degrees. If we can find the position of N and M relative to L. Suppose we imagine the circle with center P. Let me assume points arranged such that starting from N, going through L, then to M. Wait, but without knowing the order, it's hard. But since angle NPL is 90 degrees, and angle MPL is 65 degrees, perhaps the arcs add up. 

If arc NL is 90 degrees, and arc ML is 65 degrees, then depending on the direction, arc NM could be arc NL minus arc ML, or something else. But if N, L, and M are positioned such that moving from N to L to M, then arc NM would be arc NL plus arc LM? Wait, no. Let me think. If you have points N and M on the circle, with L being another point. If angle NPL is 90 degrees, so arc NL is 90 degrees. Angle MPL is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. Depending on the positions of N, L, and M. 

Assuming that points N, L, and M are arranged around the circle such that when you go from N to L to M, then arc NL is 90 degrees, arc LM is 65 degrees, then total arc NM would be arc NL + arc LM = 90 + 65 = 155 degrees. But that seems too big. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides. Wait, but maybe the arcs overlap. 

Alternatively, since angle NPM is 25 degrees, which is the central angle, so arc NM is 25 degrees. Which matches our earlier conclusion. 

But why is angle NPM equal to 25 degrees? Because angle NPM is part of the triangle NPL. Wait, angle NPM is at point P between points N and M. How do we get that angle? 

Earlier, we had that angle NPL is 90 degrees, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So if we consider angles at point P, the angles around point P would add up to 360 degrees. Wait, but point P is the center, so all the angles around P would add up to 360 degrees. However, the angles mentioned here are specific ones. 

Let me visualize: At point P, there are multiple lines: PN, PL, PM, etc. The angles between them. For instance, angle NPL is between PN and PL, which is 90 degrees. Angle MPL is between PM and PL, which is 65 degrees. So if we consider the angle between PN and PM, that would be angle NPM. 

How are these angles related? If angle between PN and PL is 90 degrees, and angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees, then the angle between PN and PM would be the difference between those two angles, assuming they are adjacent. 

For example, if you have two angles at point P: one between PN and PL (90 degrees), and another between PM and PL (65 degrees). If both angles share the same side PL, then the angle between PN and PM would be 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. That makes sense. So angle NPM is 25 degrees. 

Since angle NPM is a central angle, the measure of arc NM is equal to that angle, which is 25 degrees. Therefore, the answer is A. 

I think that's solid reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that angle NPM is formed by subtracting the given angles at point P, leading to 25 degrees, which translates to arc NM being 25 degrees. All answer choices are present, so A is the correct choice.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{NM} $ in $ \odot P $, we begin by analyzing the given information using geometric principles involving central angles and their relationships with arcs.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told:

- Point $ P $ is the center of the circle.
- Points $ N, M, L $ lie on the circle.
- $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $ (since $ NP \perp PL $).
- $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $.
  
These angles are **central angles** because their vertex is at the center of the circle ($ P $).

---

### **Step 2: Use Central Angles and Their Relationship with Arcs**

Central angles are equal in measure to the arcs they intercept:

- $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $ implies $ \overset{\frown}{NL} = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $ implies $ \overset{\frown}{ML} = 65^\circ $

From the diagram, we observe that:

$$
\angle NPL = \angle NPM + \angle MPL
$$

This allows us to write:

$$
\angle NPM = \angle NPL - \angle MPL = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Relate the Central Angle to the Intercepted Arc**

Because $ \angle NPM $ is a **central angle**, the measure of the arc it intercepts is equal to the measure of the angle itself:

$$
\text{Measure of } \overset{\frown}{NM} = \angle NPM = 25^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the measure of arc $ \widehat{NM} $ is $ 25^\circ $. This matches option **A**.

---

**Final Answer:** A

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
