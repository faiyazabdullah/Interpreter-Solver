MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with some constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, there are points A, B, C, D, E, F. Then there are lines: Line(D,C) and Line(A,E). The angles mentioned are Angle(D,E,A) and Angle(D,E,B). Also, there's a right angle at Angle(D,E,A), which means that measure is 90 degrees. Then there's another angle, Angle(D,E,B), whose measure is x. Additionally, the sum of the measures of Angle(D,E,B) and Angle(D,E,A) equals 180 degrees. Also, Point E lies on both Line(D,C) and Line(A,E), and Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C).

Wait, hold on. Let me parse this again. The problem states:

- RightAngle(Angle(D,E,A)) so that angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A)) = 90Â°.

Then, Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A))), 180). Since MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A)) is 90, then MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)) + 90 = 180. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)) would be 90. But wait, that would make x equal to 90? But looking at the answer choices, option B is 90. However, maybe I'm missing something here?

But let me check again. Wait, the problem says that Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C). So, since E lies on both Line(D,C) and Line(A,E), that suggests that Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C) at point E. Therefore, the two lines intersect at E, forming right angles. 

Now, considering the angles at point E. Let me visualize this. Points D and C define line DC. Point E is somewhere on DC (since PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D,C))). Also, Line(A,E) is perpendicular to DC. So, AE is perpendicular to DC, meaning that angle between AE and DC is 90 degrees. 

So, at point E, there are two lines: DC and AE, intersecting perpendicularly. Now, the angles mentioned are Angle(D,E,A) and Angle(D,E,B). Let me think about how these angles are formed. 

Angle(D,E,A) would be the angle at point E between points D, E, A. Similarly, Angle(D,E,B) is the angle at point E between points D, E, B. Wait, but how do these angles relate? 

Since AE is perpendicular to DC, which contains point D and C. So, if we consider line DC passing through E, and AE being perpendicular to it. So, AE forms a right angle with DC. 

Let me sketch mentally. Suppose line DC is horizontal, and E is a point on DC. Then AE is vertical (perpendicular to DC). So, point A is somewhere along the vertical line AE. Now, angle DEA is the angle at E between D-E-A. Since AE is perpendicular to DC, then angle DEA is 90 degrees, as given. That matches the RightAngle(Angle(D,E,A)). 

Now, angle DEB is the angle at E between D-E-B. So, point B is another point such that when connected to E, creates angle DEB. The sum of angle DEB and angle DEA is 180 degrees. Since angle DEA is 90, then angle DEB must be 90 degrees. So x is 90. But that seems straightforward. But why is this a question? Maybe there's more to it?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the position of point B. The problem mentions point B, but how does it relate? Is there any constraint on point B besides the angle? Let me check the problem again.

The problem lists points A, B, C, D, E, F. But the only constraints involving B are the angle DEB and the sum with DEA. Also, there's no mention of other constraints for point B. So, unless there's something else, like maybe triangle or something else... Hmm.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in how the angles are measured? For example, angle DEA is 90 degrees, and angle DEB is x. If lines EA and EB form angles with ED, but since EA is perpendicular to DC, maybe EB is forming some relation?

Wait, but if line DC is horizontal, and AE is vertical upwards from E. Then, if you have point B somewhere. The angle DEB is the angle between ED and EB at point E. So, depending on where B is located, that angle can vary. However, according to the given constraints, SumOf(angle DEB and angle DEA) equals 180. Since angle DEA is 90, then angle DEB must be 90. Hence x=90. 

But then answer B is 90. However, maybe there's a mistake here. Because angle DEA is already 90, and adding angle DEB makes 180. So angle DEB would be 90. But then, how is that possible? If AE is perpendicular to DC, then line AE is perpendicular to DC. So, if we imagine ED as part of DC, going from E to D, then angle between ED and EA is 90 degrees. If angle DEB is also 90 degrees, then EB would be aligned with EA? Or in the opposite direction?

Wait, suppose line DC is horizontal, E is on DC. AE is vertical upwards. So, ED is pointing towards D (which is left or right along DC from E). Then angle DEA is between ED and EA, which is 90 degrees. Now, angle DEB is between ED and EB. If angle DEB is 90 degrees, then EB would be in the same direction as EA, but maybe in the opposite direction? Or perhaps EB is a different line?

Wait, but without knowing where B is, how can we determine angle DEB? Unless there's some other constraints. Wait, maybe B is related to other points? Like, perhaps B is on line AE? Or maybe there's another condition?

Looking back at the problem statement, the only constraints involving B are the angle DEB and the sum. There's no explicit info about B's location except through the angle. So, maybe the key is that since AE is perpendicular to DC, and angle DEA is 90 degrees, then angle DEB must be supplementary to that. So, if they add up to 180, then angle DEB is 90. Therefore, x is 90. 

But then answer B is 90. However, sometimes problems might trick you. Let me check again. Are there any other constraints? The problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,E)), which just confirms that E is on both lines. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(D,C)), which is already considered. 

Another thought: maybe the angles are on different sides. For instance, if angle DEA is 90 degrees, and angle DEB is adjacent to it, making a straight line. Wait, but if angle DEA is between ED and EA, and angle DEB is between ED and EB, then if EA and EB are on opposite sides of ED, their sum could be 180. But since EA is perpendicular to ED (because AE is perpendicular to DC, which includes ED), then if EB is in the opposite direction of EA relative to ED, then angle DEB would be 90 degrees as well. But then, how does that fit into the sum?

Wait, if angle DEA is 90 degrees, and angle DEB is also 90 degrees, then their sum is 180. Which fits the given equation. Therefore, x=90. So answer B. 

But wait, maybe there's a case where angle DEB is not 90? Suppose that point B is not on AE. Then, the angle DEB could vary. However, the problem gives that the sum of angle DEB and angle DEA is 180. Given that angle DEA is fixed at 90, angle DEB must be 90. So regardless of where B is, as long as the sum is 180, angle DEB has to be 90. 

Therefore, x is 90. So answer B. But let me check if there's a possibility that the sum refers to something else. Wait, the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,A))) equals 180. So, that's angle DEB plus angle DEA equals 180. Since angle DEA is 90, angle DEB is 90. So x=90. 

But the answer choices include B as 90. So then, Final Answer: B. 

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Could there be a miscalculation here? Let me think again. If line AE is perpendicular to DC, then angle between AE and DC is 90 degrees. At point E, the line DC passes through E, and AE is perpendicular. So, if you look at angle DEA, which is between D-E-A, that's 90 degrees. Now, angle DEB is between D-E-B. Depending on where B is, but if we assume that B is on the line AE extended, then angle DEB would be 90 degrees as well. But if B is somewhere else, maybe not. However, the problem doesn't specify where B is, except through the angle. So the fact that the sum of angle DEB and angle DEA is 180 implies that angle DEB must be 90 degrees. Therefore, x=90. 

Hence, the correct answer should be B. So I think the answer is B.
