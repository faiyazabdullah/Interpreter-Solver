MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a right triangle V, W, X. The problem gives us some specific information about the sides and angles. Let me start by recalling that in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds. Also, since they mention cos of angle X, I need to remember how cosine relates to the sides of a triangle.

First, let me note down the given lengths. The length of line VW is 72 units, WX is 21 units, and VX is 75 units. Wait, but since it's a right triangle, the hypotenuse should be the longest side. Here, VX is 75, which is longer than both 72 and 21, so that makes sense. The problem also states that angle at W is a right angle because it says Perpendicular(Line(V,W), Line(W,X)). So, the right angle is at point W. That means the legs are VW and WX, and the hypotenuse is VX.

Now, the question asks for the ratio of cos X. Let me recall that in a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. But first, I need to make sure which angle we're talking about here. The angle X is at point X, right? Because the notation Angle(V,W,X) usually denotes the angle at point W between points V and X. Wait, no—wait. In standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B. So Angle(V,W,X) would be the angle at W. But wait, the problem mentions Angle(V,W,X) is a right angle, so that's confirmed. Then, the question is asking for cos of Angle(X). Wait, that might be confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me parse the problem again. The problem says:

"Angle(V,W,X)" is a RightAngle. So that's the angle at W, since it's the middle letter. So the right angle is at W. Then, the question is asking for CosOf(Angle(X)). So Angle(X) would be the angle at point X. So in triangle VWX, angle at X. Therefore, we need to find cos(angle at X).

So, in triangle VWX, with right angle at W. So the triangle has vertices V, W, X, with right angle at W. Therefore, sides:

VW = 72 (one leg)

WX = 21 (other leg)

VX = 75 (hypotenuse)

We need to find cos of angle at X. Let me visualize this triangle. At point X, angle X is opposite to side VW (since in triangle, each angle is opposite the corresponding side). Wait, no. Let me think again.

In triangle VWX, the sides are:

Opposite angle V: side WX (length 21)

Opposite angle W: side VX (length 75)

Opposite angle X: side VW (length 72)

But wait, hold on. Wait, angle at X is opposite to side VW. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Let me label the triangle. Points V, W, X. Right angle at W. So imagine point W is the corner where the two legs meet. So lines VW and WX are perpendicular. Then, the hypotenuse is VX connecting V and X. So, angle at X is formed by sides WX and VX. So, angle at X is between side WX (which is one leg, length 21) and hypotenuse VX (length 75). Therefore, when calculating cos of angle X, which is adjacent over hypotenuse?

Wait, in the context of right triangles, for angle X, the adjacent side would be the side that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. So, angle X is at vertex X. The sides forming angle X are side WX (from X to W) and side VX (from X to V). So, the adjacent side to angle X would be the side that is next to angle X and not the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps another way: in the right triangle, angle X is not the right angle. So, the adjacent side would be the side that is adjacent to angle X and part of the triangle. 

Alternatively, using the definition of cosine: adjacent over hypotenuse. For angle X, the adjacent side is the side that forms the angle X and is adjacent to it. Since angle X is at point X, looking at the triangle, the sides connected to X are WX and VX. The hypotenuse is VX. Wait, no. Wait, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So hypotenuse is VX. Therefore, for angle X, the hypotenuse is VX. The adjacent side would be the side that is adjacent to angle X and not the hypotenuse. So, the adjacent side would be WX. Wait, because angle X is between side WX and hypotenuse VX. So yes, the adjacent side is WX (length 21), and hypotenuse is VX (length 75). Therefore, cos(angle X) = adjacent / hypotenuse = WX / VX = 21/75.

Wait, but the problem says "RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), LengthOf(Line(V,X)))", which is exactly 21/75. And then Equals(CosOf(Angle(X)), RatioOf(...)), so according to the problem statement, they set up that equation. However, the problem is asking to express the ratio of cos X as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. So compute 21 divided by 75.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my reasoning again. If angle X is at vertex X, then adjacent side is WX (length 21), hypotenuse is VX (length 75). Therefore, cos(X) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 21/75. Let me calculate that.

21 divided by 75. Let me do the division. Well, 21 ÷ 75. Let me compute that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 7/25. Which is 0.28. So 0.28. Therefore, the answer should be 0.28, which is option A. But wait, let me confirm once more if I got the adjacent side right.

Another approach: use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point W at the origin (0,0). Since it's a right angle at W, then let me assume that line VW is along the x-axis and line WX is along the y-axis. So point W is at (0,0). Point V is along the x-axis, so its coordinates are (72, 0), since VW is 72 units. Point X is along the y-axis, so its coordinates are (0, 21), since WX is 21 units. Then, the hypotenuse VX connects (72, 0) to (0, 21). Now, angle at X is the angle between the hypotenuse VX and the side WX. To find cos of that angle.

Alternatively, using vectors. The angle at X can be found by considering vectors from X to V and from X to W. Vector XV is from X to V: (72 - 0, 0 - 21) = (72, -21). Vector XW is from X to W: (0 - 0, 0 - 21) = (0, -21). Then, the cosine of the angle between these two vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Dot product of XV and XW: (72)(0) + (-21)(-21) = 0 + 441 = 441.

Magnitude of XV: sqrt(72² + (-21)^2) = sqrt(5184 + 441) = sqrt(5625) = 75, which matches the given hypotenuse length.

Magnitude of XW: sqrt(0² + (-21)^2) = 21.

Therefore, cos(theta) = 441/(75*21) = 441/(1575) = divide numerator and denominator by 21: 21/75 = same as before, 0.28. So that confirms the earlier calculation. Thus, cos(angle X) is 0.28, which is option A.

Wait, but why does the problem include all those constraints? Like the fact that it's a right triangle, etc.? Because maybe someone could get confused about which angle they were supposed to take. But in this case, the setup was clear. So the answer is 0.28, so option A. But let me check if there's any chance that angle X is different. For example, if someone thought that angle X is the right angle, but no, the right angle is at W. So angle X is definitely one of the acute angles. Hence, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be A. 0.28. Let me check the answer choices again. Yes, option A is 0.28. So the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\cos X$ in the given triangle $VWX$, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure and applying trigonometric principles.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Triangle Structure**

The problem provides the following key details:

- Triangle $VWX$ is a **right triangle** with a **right angle at $W$**.
- Side $VW = 72$
- Side $WX = 21$
- Hypotenuse $VX = 75$

This tells us that the triangle follows the **Pythagorean Theorem**:
$$
VW^2 + WX^2 = VX^2 \\
72^2 + 21^2 = 5184 + 441 = 5625 = 75^2
$$
Thus, the triangle is valid and consistent with being a right triangle.

---

### **Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Angle**

We are asked to compute:
$$
\cos(\angle X)
$$
Since $\angle X$ is at vertex $X$, we consider the angle formed between side $WX$ and the hypotenuse $VX$. This angle lies at vertex $X$, and in a right triangle, the **adjacent side** to angle $X$ is the leg **opposite the right angle**, i.e., the **side $WX$**.

However, more precisely, based on the definition of cosine in a right triangle:
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
$$
For $\angle X$, the **adjacent side** is the segment **connected to $X$** and **not the hypotenuse** — this is **side $WX$** (length = 21), and the **hypotenuse** is **side $VX$** (length = 75).

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Cosine Value**

Using the formula:
$$
\cos(\angle X) = \frac{\text{Length of } WX}{\text{Length of } VX} = \frac{21}{75}
$$

Performing the division:
$$
\frac{21}{75} = 0.28
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The computed value of $\cos(\angle X)$ is $0.28$. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest match is:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
