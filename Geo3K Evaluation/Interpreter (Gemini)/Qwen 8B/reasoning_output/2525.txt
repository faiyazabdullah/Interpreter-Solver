====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have triangle ABC with a perimeter of 25, and we need to find x based on some given conditions. Let me start by listing all the information given.

First, the triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point B because angle ABC is a right angle. Also, it's mentioned that AB equals BC, so that makes it an isosceles right-angled triangle. Wait, if AB equals BC and the right angle is at B, then legs AB and BC are equal. That means the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse would be AC.

Now, since it's a right-angled triangle with legs equal, the sides can be represented as follows: Let’s denote AB = BC = a. Then, by Pythagoras theorem, AC (the hypotenuse) would be a√2. 

The perimeter of the triangle is AB + BC + AC = a + a + a√2 = 2a + a√2. And this perimeter is given as 25. So:

2a + a√2 = 25  
Factor out a: a(2 + √2) = 25  
Therefore, solving for a gives:  
a = 25 / (2 + √2)

But maybe I should rationalize the denominator here. Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √2):

a = [25 * (2 - √2)] / [(2 + √2)(2 - √2)]  
Denominator becomes 2² - (√2)² = 4 - 2 = 2  
So, a = [25*(2 - √2)] / 2  

Hmm, but wait, the question asks for x. Looking back at the problem statement, there's a line that says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Mul(3,x)). So AB = 3x. Since AB is equal to BC, which we denoted as 'a', then AB = a = 3x. Therefore, substituting into our equation:

a = 3x  
So, 3x = 25 / (2 + √2)  
Then, solving for x:  
x = 25 / [3*(2 + √2)]

Again, rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √2):

x = [25*(2 - √2)] / [3*(2 + √2)(2 - √2)]  
As before, denominator is 3*2 = 6  
So, x = [25*(2 - √2)] / 6  

Let me compute this value numerically to see what it approximates to. First, calculate √2 ≈ 1.4142.

So, 2 - √2 ≈ 2 - 1.4142 ≈ 0.5858

Then, multiply by 25: 25 * 0.5858 ≈ 14.645

Divide by 6: 14.645 / 6 ≈ 2.4408...

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, they are integers: 3, 6, 7, 9. My calculation gives approximately 2.44, which isn't among them. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the relationship between AB and x? Let me check again.

The problem states: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Mul(3,x)). So AB = 3x. But earlier, I thought AB was equal to BC, which is part of the isosceles right triangle. Let me re-examine the given constraints.

Looking back, the problem mentions that Triangle(A,B,C) is Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) with the right angle at Angle(A,B,C). So angle at B is the right angle. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So AB equals BC, making legs AB and BC equal. Hence, yes, AB=BC=a, hypotenuse AC=a√2. Perimeter is a + a + a√2 = 2a + a√2 = 25.

So AB = a = 3x. Therefore, substituting a = 3x into perimeter equation:

2*(3x) + 3x*√2 = 25  
Which simplifies to 6x + 3x√2 = 25  
Factor out 3x: 3x(2 + √2) = 25  
Thus, x = 25 / [3(2 + √2)]  
Which is same as before. So my calculation seems correct, but the numerical value isn't matching the answer choices. Maybe I made a wrong assumption?

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the circle E has AC as diameter. The problem says IsDiameterOf(Line(A,C), Circle(E)). So AC is the diameter of the circle. Also, points A and C lie on the circle. Also, lines AB and BC are tangent to the circle. Since AC is the diameter, the center of the circle is the midpoint of AC, which is point E. Because PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,C)) and IsMidpointOf(E, Line(A,C)). So E is the midpoint of AC.

Moreover, since AB and BC are tangent to the circle. For a line to be tangent to a circle, the distance from the center to the line must equal the radius. Alternatively, using properties of tangents from a point to a circle.

Since E is the midpoint of AC, the radius of the circle is half of AC, which is AE = EC = AC/2.

But AB and BC are tangent to the circle. Let me recall that the tangent from a point outside the circle has length sqrt(d^2 - r^2), where d is the distance from the point to the center, and r is the radius.

But since AB is tangent to the circle, and point B lies outside the circle. Similarly for BC. Let me consider the tangent lengths.

For line AB being tangent to the circle. The tangent from point B to the circle would touch at some point. However, since AB is tangent, and point A is on the circle, does that mean AB is tangent at A? Wait, point A lies on the circle. If AB is tangent to the circle at A, then AB would be perpendicular to the radius EA. Because the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

Similarly, if BC is tangent to the circle at C, then BC is perpendicular to EC. So, since E is the midpoint of AC, then EA and EC are radii. So if AB is tangent at A, then AB ⊥ EA. Similarly, BC ⊥ EC.

But in triangle ABC, angle at B is a right angle. Wait, angle ABC is the right angle. If AB is perpendicular to EA and BC is perpendicular to EC, then EA and EC are both perpendicular to AB and BC respectively. Let me visualize.

Let me draw triangle ABC with right angle at B. AC is the hypotenuse. E is the midpoint of AC. Then EA and EC are radii of the circle. If AB is tangent at A, then EA is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, EC is perpendicular to BC. But since EA is perpendicular to AB, and EC is perpendicular to BC, then angles at A and C would be... Wait, but in triangle ABC, angle at B is 90 degrees. So, if EA is perpendicular to AB, then EA is parallel to BC? Because AB is perpendicular to BC (since ABC is right-angled at B). Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If EA is perpendicular to AB, then EA is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is one leg of the triangle. Also, EC is perpendicular to BC. Now, since E is the midpoint of AC, then coordinates could help here.

Maybe assigning coordinates would make this easier. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0), since it's the right angle. Let me assume AB is along the y-axis and BC along the x-axis. Let AB = BC = a. Then coordinates:

Point B: (0,0)

Point A: (0, a)

Point C: (a, 0)

Then AC goes from (0,a) to (a,0), so midpoint E is at ((a/2), (a/2)).

Now, the circle with diameter AC has center at E (a/2, a/2) and radius (AC)/2. AC length is sqrt(a² + a²) = a√2, so radius is (a√2)/2 = a/√2.

Now, check if AB is tangent to the circle. AB is the vertical line from (0,0) to (0,a). Let me check if this line is tangent to the circle centered at (a/2, a/2) with radius a/√2.

To verify if AB is tangent to the circle, we can compute the distance from the center E to line AB and check if it equals the radius.

Equation of line AB: It's the line x=0 (the y-axis).

Distance from E (a/2, a/2) to line x=0 is |a/2 - 0| = a/2.

Compare this with the radius, which is a/√2. For AB to be tangent, these distances must be equal. Therefore:

a/2 = a/√2 → divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0):

1/2 = 1/√2 → Which implies √2 = 2 → Contradiction! So something's wrong here. This suggests that my initial assumption that AB is tangent at A may be incorrect. Or perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, the problem states that lines AB and BC are tangent to the circle. So even though points A and C are on the circle, the lines AB and BC are tangent. However, in my coordinate system, line AB passes through A (which is on the circle), so if AB were tangent at A, then AB would be tangent. But according to the previous calculation, the distance from E to AB is a/2, while the radius is a/√2. These are only equal if a/2 = a/√2 ⇒ √2 = 2, which is false. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that AB is tangent at A is wrong. Instead, the line AB is tangent to the circle at some other point, not at A.

Wait, but point A is on the circle. How can line AB be tangent to the circle if it contains point A, which is on the circle? Unless line AB touches the circle only at point A, meaning it's tangent at A. But according to the previous calculation, that's not possible unless √2 = 2. Therefore, there must be an error in reasoning.

Wait, maybe the line AB is tangent to the circle at a different point, not at A. But point A is on the circle, so line AB starts at A and goes to B. If AB is tangent to the circle, then it can only touch the circle at A. Otherwise, if it intersects the circle at another point, it wouldn't be tangent. So this suggests that AB is tangent at A, but that leads to inconsistency. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which indicates that my coordinate assumption might be wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Let me re-express the distance from E to line AB. In the coordinate system, line AB is x=0. Center E is at (a/2, a/2). Distance from E to AB is indeed a/2. Radius of the circle is a/√2. For AB to be tangent, this distance must equal the radius. Thus:

a/2 = a/√2 ⇒ 1/2 = 1/√2 ⇒ √2 = 2, which is impossible. So this suggests that under the given conditions, such a triangle cannot exist, but the problem says it exists. Therefore, my assumptions must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the circle is not the circumcircle of triangle ABC? Wait, the circle has diameter AC. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circumcircle. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. So if AC is the hypotenuse, then the circumcircle has diameter AC, which matches the given condition. But in that case, the circumcircle would pass through all three vertices A, B, C. However, in that case, line AB would intersect the circle at A and B, but since B is also on the circle. Wait, but if B is on the circle, then line AB would be a chord of the circle, not a tangent. But the problem states that line AB is tangent to the circle. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a fundamental issue here.

Wait, the problem says that lines AB and BC are tangent to the circle. But if the circle has diameter AC, then points A and C are on the circle. If AB is tangent to the circle, then AB touches the circle at exactly one point. But since A is already on the circle, AB must be tangent at A. Similarly for BC tangent at C. But earlier calculation shows that this is not possible unless √2 = 2. So this suggests either the problem has conflicting constraints, or my understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the circle is not the circumcircle? Let me read the problem again. It says "Circle(E)" with E being the midpoint of AC. So the circle has center E (midpoint of AC) and radius equal to half of AC. But in a right-angled triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the circumcenter, and the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. So this is the circumcircle. But in that case, points A, B, C are on the circle. So line AB would be a secant, passing through A and B (both on the circle), hence not tangent. But the problem says AB is tangent to the circle. This is a contradiction. So there must be an error in the problem setup or my interpretation.

Wait, but the problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(A,Circle(E))" and "PointLiesOnCircle(C,Circle(E))", so points A and C are on the circle. But point B is not necessarily on the circle. Wait, but if the circle has diameter AC, then any point B such that angle ABC is a right angle would lie on the circle. Wait, no— in the Thales' theorem, if you have a circle with diameter AC, then any point B on the circle forms a right angle at B. But in our case, the triangle ABC has a right angle at B, so B must lie on the circle. Hence, points A, B, C are all on the circle. So line AB is a chord of the circle, not a tangent. But the problem states that line AB is tangent to the circle. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "Tangent(Line(A,B), Circle(E))". So line AB is tangent to the circle. But if points A and B are both on the circle, then line AB can't be tangent—it must intersect the circle at two points (A and B). Hence, this is impossible unless B coincides with A, which it doesn't. Therefore, there's a conflict in the constraints. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps my misinterpretation of the constraints.

Wait, maybe the circle is not having AC as diameter, but instead having another diameter? No, the constraint says IsDiameterOf(Line(A,C), Circle(E)), so AC is the diameter. 

This seems like a paradox. How can AB be tangent to the circle when it contains point A which is on the circle? Unless AB is tangent at a different point, but it starts at A. So unless AB is tangent at A, but that requires the line AB to be tangent at A, implying that AB is perpendicular to the radius at A. The radius at A is EA (from E to A). So vector EA is from E to A. Let me compute that.

In coordinates, E is midpoint of AC. If A is (0, a), C is (a, 0), then E is (a/2, a/2). Vector EA is from E to A: (0 - a/2, a - a/2) = (-a/2, a/2). The direction of AB is from A to B: B is (0,0), so vector AB is (0 - 0, 0 - a) = (0, -a). For AB to be tangent at A, the line AB must be perpendicular to EA. Let's check their slopes.

Vector EA has slope (a/2)/( -a/2 ) = -1. Vector AB is vertical (since it goes from (0,a) to (0,0)), which is undefined slope. A vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line, but EA has slope -1, which is neither horizontal nor vertical. So AB is vertical, EA has slope -1. Are they perpendicular? The product of slopes would be undefined (vertical line) times -1. To check if they're perpendicular, the dot product of vectors EA and AB should be zero.

Vector EA: (-a/2, a/2)  
Vector AB: (0 - 0, 0 - a) = (0, -a)  
Dot product: (-a/2)*0 + (a/2)*(-a) = -a²/2 ≠ 0. Not perpendicular. Hence, AB is not perpendicular to EA. Therefore, line AB is not tangent at A. Hence, the previous conclusion that AB is tangent to the circle is invalid in this configuration.

This suggests that the given constraints are contradictory. However, the problem presents it as solvable, so I must have missed something. Perhaps the circle is not the circumcircle? Or maybe E is not the midpoint of AC? Wait, the problem says IsMidpointOf(E, Line(A,C)), so E is the midpoint. So AC is diameter, E is midpoint, and points A and C are on the circle. But then line AB is supposed to be tangent to the circle. This seems impossible unless AB is tangent at a different point.

Wait, let's suppose that line AB is tangent to the circle at some point other than A or C. But since A is on the circle, and line AB starts at A, it can't be tangent elsewhere. Because if it starts at A, which is on the circle, then it can't be tangent; it would have to intersect the circle at least at A. For it to be tangent, it must touch at exactly one point. Hence, only possibility is tangent at A. But as shown earlier, this requires specific conditions that aren't met. So this suggests that the given constraints are inconsistent. But since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Alternative approach: Let's forget about the circle for a moment and focus on the triangle. We know it's a right-angled isosceles triangle with perimeter 25. Let me solve it without considering the circle.

Let AB = BC = a, AC = a√2. Perimeter: 2a + a√2 = 25. Solve for a:

a = 25 / (2 + √2)  
Rationalizing:

a = [25(2 - √2)] / ( (2 + √2)(2 - √2) )  
Denominator: 4 - 2 = 2  
So a = [25(2 - √2)] / 2  
AB = a = 3x => x = a / 3  
Substituting:

x = [25(2 - √2)] / (2 * 3) = [25(2 - √2)] / 6  
Calculate approximate value:

√2 ≈ 1.414  
2 - √2 ≈ 0.586  
So x ≈ 25 * 0.586 / 6 ≈ 14.65 / 6 ≈ 2.441

But none of the answer choices are close to 2.44. The closest option is 3, but it's still off. Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Mul(3,x)). So AB = 3x. Earlier, I assumed AB = BC = a, but is that correct?

Yes, because Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))) is given. So AB = BC = a. So the perimeter is a + a + a√2 = 25. Hence, a(2 + √2) = 25. So a = 25/(2 + √2). Then AB = a = 3x => x = a/3 = 25/[3(2 + √2)].

But let's rationalize this expression:

x = 25/(3(2 + √2)) * (2 - √2)/(2 - √2) = 25(2 - √2)/[3*(4 - 2)] = 25(2 - √2)/(3*2) = 25(2 - √2)/6

As before. Now, if I plug in √2 ≈ 1.414, then 2 - √2 ≈ 0.586. So 25 * 0.586 ≈ 14.65. Divided by 6 ≈ 2.44. Still not matching answer choices.

But the answer choices are 3, 6, 7, 9. None of these are close. This suggests that maybe the triangle isn't isosceles? Wait, but the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So AB = BC. So it must be isosceles. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that AB = BC. Let me check the constraints again.

The problem says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). Yes, so AB = BC. And the triangle is right-angled at B. So it must be isosceles right-angled. So the perimeter is 2a + a√2 = 25. So this seems correct.

But maybe the problem uses a different definition? Like, maybe the right angle is at A or C? No, the Angle(A,B,C) is the right angle. So angle at B.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle's presence affects the side lengths? For example, the tangency conditions impose additional constraints.

Let me revisit the circle part. If AB and BC are tangent to the circle with diameter AC, then using the property that the tangent segment squared equals the power of the point.

For point B outside the circle, the square of the length of the tangent from B to the circle is equal to the power of B with respect to the circle. Power of B is |BE|^2 - r^2, where BE is the distance from B to the center E, and r is the radius.

Since AB and BC are tangent to the circle, the lengths of the tangents from B to the circle are equal. Let me denote the tangent length as t. So, t^2 = |BE|^2 - r^2.

But AB is a tangent, so the length of the tangent from B to the circle is equal to AB? No, because AB is the tangent line, but point A is on the circle. Wait, if line AB is tangent to the circle, then the tangent from B to the circle would be BA. But since A is on the circle, the length of the tangent from B to the circle is BA. Wait, but BA is a secant if A is on the circle. Wait, no—if the line AB is tangent to the circle, then point A is the point of tangency. Hence, BA is the tangent segment from B to the circle, and its length is equal to the length of the tangent from B to the circle. So, the length of the tangent from B to the circle is BA. Similarly, the length of the tangent from B to the circle is also BC, since BC is another tangent. Hence, BA = BC. Which is consistent with the given condition that AB = BC. So this confirms that AB = BC.

But how does this help us? Let me use the power of point B with respect to the circle. The power of B is equal to BA^2 = BC^2 = t^2. On the other hand, power of B is also |BE|^2 - r^2. So:

BA^2 = |BE|^2 - r^2  
We can compute |BE| and r.

From earlier, E is the midpoint of AC. Let's express coordinates again. Let me take coordinates where B is at (0,0), A at (0, a), C at (a, 0), so AC has midpoint E at (a/2, a/2). The length of AC is a√2, so radius r = (a√2)/2 = a/√2.

Distance from B(0,0) to E(a/2, a/2) is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2] = sqrt(a²/4 + a²/4) = sqrt(a²/2) = a/√2.

So |BE| = a/√2, and r = a/√2. Hence, power of B is |BE|^2 - r^2 = (a²/2) - (a²/2) = 0. Hence, BA^2 = 0 ⇒ BA = 0, which is impossible. This suggests that point B lies on the circle, which contradicts the fact that AB is tangent to the circle (unless B is the point of tangency, but then AB would be a tangent at B, but B is on the circle. But if B is on the circle, then AB is a chord, not tangent. This is a contradiction again.

This suggests that the given constraints are inconsistent, which is confusing because the problem is presented as solvable. There must be an error in my understanding. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: Tangent(Line(A,B), Circle(E)), so line AB is tangent to the circle. Point A lies on the circle. Hence, line AB is tangent at A. Hence, AB is tangent at A, so AB is perpendicular to the radius at A, which is EA. So vector EA should be perpendicular to AB.

Earlier calculation showed that in coordinates, vector EA is (-a/2, a/2), and vector AB is (0, -a). Their dot product is (-a/2)(0) + (a/2)(-a) = -a²/2 ≠ 0. So they are not perpendicular. This implies that the given conditions are impossible, unless a = 0, which is not possible.

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem's constraints, making it unsolvable. But since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the circle is not the one with diameter AC, but another circle? Wait, the problem says IsDiameterOf(Line(A,C), Circle(E)), so AC is the diameter. So E is the midpoint of AC. So everything else holds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the power of point B? Let me re-calculate.

Power of B with respect to circle: |BE|^2 - r^2. From above, |BE| = a/√2, r = a/√2. So power is (a²/2) - (a²/2) = 0. Hence, power is zero, which means B lies on the circle. Hence, AB is a chord, not tangent. But the problem states it is tangent. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that the problem is flawed, but since it's an exam question, likely there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Let me try to ignore the circle part and focus on the triangle. Given that it's a right-angled isosceles triangle with perimeter 25, and AB = 3x. Let me solve it without the circle constraints.

Let AB = BC = a, AC = a√2. Perimeter: 2a + a√2 = 25. Solving for a:

a = 25 / (2 + √2)  
Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √2):

a = 25(2 - √2) / (4 - 2) = 25(2 - √2)/2  
AB = a = 3x => x = a/3 = 25(2 - √2)/6  
Approximating √2 ≈ 1.414:

2 - √2 ≈ 0.586  
x ≈ 25 * 0.586 / 6 ≈ 14.65 / 6 ≈ 2.44

But this is not among the choices. The closest is 3. Perhaps the problem expects rounding? Or perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe the triangle isn't isosceles? But the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So AB = BC. So it must be isosceles. 

Wait, maybe the perimeter formula is different? Let me double-check. If it's a right-angled isosceles triangle, then the sides are a, a, a√2. Perimeter: a + a + a√2 = 2a + a√2. Correct.

Let me try to express x in terms of perimeter. Let me set AB = 3x, so BC = 3x. AC = 3x√2. Perimeter: 3x + 3x + 3x√2 = 3x(2 + √2) = 25. Hence, x = 25 / [3(2 + √2)]. Rationalizing:

x = [25(2 - √2)] / [3(2 + √2)(2 - √2)] = [25(2 - √2)] / [3*2] = [25(2 - √2)] / 6.

Now, if I approximate this:

2 - √2 ≈ 2 - 1.4142 ≈ 0.5858

25 * 0.5858 ≈ 14.645

Divide by 6: ≈ 2.4408.

Still not matching any choices. But maybe the problem assumes √2 = 1.414, and wants an exact form? But the answer choices are numerical. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the perimeter calculation.

Wait, let me try plugging x=3 into the perimeter. If x=3, then AB = 9. So BC=9, AC=9√2. Perimeter: 9 + 9 + 9√2 = 18 + 9√2 ≈ 18 + 12.727 ≈ 30.727, which is greater than 25. Not matching.

If x=2, perimeter would be 2*(2+√2)*3x = 2*(2+√2)*6 = 12(2+√2) ≈ 12*3.414 ≈ 40.97. No.

Wait, but the actual value of x is approximately 2.44. If the options are 3, 6, 7, 9, and the closest is 3, maybe the intended answer is A.3. But why? Perhaps the problem assumes that the triangle is not isosceles, but that contradicts the given condition. Or maybe there's an error in the problem's translation.

Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter is 25, and we need to find x such that AB = 3x. Let me consider the perimeter expression:

Perimeter = AB + BC + AC = 3x + 3x + 3x√2 = 3x(2 + √2) = 25.

So x = 25 / [3(2 + √2)].

But let's rationalize this expression differently. Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √2):

x = 25(2 + √2) / [3(2 + √2)^2]

Wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, original expression is x = 25 / [3(2 + √2)].

If I approximate this value numerically, it's approximately 25 / [3*3.414] ≈ 25 / 10.242 ≈ 2.44. Still no match.

But the answer choices are A.3, B.6, C.7, D.9. If forced to pick the closest, it's A.3. But this feels like a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem, and the intended perimeter was 30, leading to x=3. For example, if perimeter is 30, then x = 30 / [3(2 + √2)] ≈ 30 / 10.242 ≈ 2.928, closer to 3. But the given perimeter is 25.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that AC is the diameter, and the tangents AB and BC are equal to 3x, but that's not what's stated.

Given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.44, and the closest choice is 3, I'll go with A.3, even though it's not precise. Maybe the problem expects rounding or there's a miscalculation I missed.
