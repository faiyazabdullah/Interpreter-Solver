MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle ABC here. So, we have points A, B, and C. There are two parallel lines, l and m. The angles at DAB and BCH are given as 38° and 33° respectively. Also, points A and C lie on lines l and m, which are parallel. Lines AB and BC are drawn, so triangle ABC might be involved?

First, since lines l and m are parallel, maybe there's some transversal cutting through them. Let me visualize this. Points A and C are on lines l and m. Then line AB connects A to B, and line BC connects B to C. Wait, but how do these lines interact with the parallel lines?

Given that point D lies on line l (since PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(l))), and H lies on line m. Also, angle DAB is 38°, which would be the angle between DA and AB. Similarly, angle BCH is 33°, which is the angle between CB and BH. But since lines l and m are parallel, and AB and BC are transversals?

Wait, maybe I need to think about alternate interior angles or corresponding angles because of the parallel lines. Let me sketch mentally: line l has point A, line m has point C. Line AB starts at A and goes to B, then BC goes from B to C. Since l and m are parallel, and AB and BC are connecting them. Maybe AB is a transversal cutting through l and m? Wait, no—AB starts at A on line l and ends at B. Then BC starts at B and ends at C on line m. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps lines l and m are cut by transversals AB and BC. But I'm getting confused. Let me recall the given angles. Angle DAB is 38°, so that's at point A between DA and AB. Since D is on line l, DA is part of line l. Therefore, line AB is forming an angle with line l at point A. Similarly, angle BCH is at point C between BC and CH, where H is on line m. So line BC forms an angle with line m at point C.

Since lines l and m are parallel, and DA is along l, and CH is along m. So when AB crosses line l at A, it makes an angle of 38° with DA (which is part of line l). Similarly, BC crosses line m at C, making an angle of 33° with CH (part of line m).

Now, considering that lines l and m are parallel, and AB and BC are transversals. Wait, but AB starts at A on l and goes to B, then BC goes from B to C on m. So maybe AB is a transversal crossing l and m? No, AB only crosses l at A. BC crosses m at C. But maybe the key is that the angles formed by the transversals with the parallel lines can help us find angle ABC.

Let me think. At point A, the angle between DA (on line l) and AB is 38°. Since DA is on line l, which is parallel to line m. If we consider AB as a transversal, then the angle at A is 38°, which could correspond to an angle on line m. Similarly, at point C, the angle between BC and CH (on line m) is 33°, so that's another angle related to the transversal BC.

But angle ABC is the angle at point B between AB and BC. To find that, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of certain angles equals angle ABC.

Wait, if lines l and m are parallel, and AB and BC are transversals, then maybe the angles at A and C relate to the angles inside the triangle ABC. Alternatively, maybe we need to consider the concept of consecutive interior angles or something similar.

Alternatively, think of lines l and m being parallel, and AB and BC as two lines intersecting at B. The angles at A and C are given. But how does that relate to angle ABC?

Wait, maybe if we extend lines AB and BC to form some relationships. Or perhaps using the idea that the sum of angles around point B?

Wait, angle DAB is 38°, which is adjacent to angle between AB and line l. Since line l and m are parallel, maybe the angle at C (angle BCH = 33°) relates to the angle at A via some property.

Another approach: When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. However, in this case, AB is a transversal crossing line l at A, and line m... Wait, AB doesn't cross line m unless extended. Similarly, BC crosses line m at C. Maybe if we consider the angles formed by AB and BC with the parallel lines.

Let me think again. Since line l and m are parallel, and DA is on line l, angle DAB is 38°, so that's like an angle between line l (DA) and AB. Similarly, at point C, line m has CH, and angle BCH is 33°, so that's between line m (CH) and BC.

If we imagine extending AB beyond B and BC beyond B, maybe those lines create some angles with the parallel lines. But without knowing more about the diagram, it's tricky. However, since lines l and m are parallel, and AB and BC are connected through point B, perhaps the angles at A and C are related to the angles formed at B.

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is supplementary to the sum of those two angles. For example, if the two angles at A and C are on the same side of the transversals, their sum might be related to angle ABC. Wait, but how?

Wait, suppose we have two parallel lines l and m. Line AB intersects line l at A, creating an angle of 38° with line l. Then, line BC intersects line m at C, creating an angle of 33° with line m. Since l and m are parallel, the angle between AB and l at A is 38°, and the angle between BC and m at C is 33°. Now, if we consider the lines AB and BC meeting at point B, then angle ABC is the angle between AB and BC. 

But how do those angles at A and C relate to angle ABC? It depends on whether AB and BC are on the same side relative to the parallel lines or opposite sides. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles at A and C are alternate interior angles or something else. Wait, if we consider AB and BC as transversals. Wait, but for alternate interior angles, they need to be on different sides. 

Wait, here's an idea: Imagine that line AB is acting as a transversal between lines l and m. But AB only meets line l at A. Unless AB continues beyond B to meet line m. Similarly, BC meets line m at C. Wait, but unless AB and BC are both transversals intersecting both lines l and m. But AB starts at A on l and goes to B; if extended, it may meet line m. Similarly, BC starts at B and goes to C on m. So, maybe AB extended meets line m at some point, say, E, and BC is already ending at C on m. 

But this seems complicated. Maybe we can consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at A is something, angle at C is something, and angle at B is what we need. Wait, but we don't know the angles at A and C directly. Wait, but maybe the angles at A and C are related to the given angles of 38° and 33°?

Wait, angle DAB is 38°, which is the angle between DA (on line l) and AB. Since DA is part of line l, then the angle between line l and AB at point A is 38°. Similarly, angle BCH is 33°, which is the angle between BC and line m at point C. So, if we think of line l and line m being parallel, then the angle between AB and line l is 38°, and the angle between BC and line m is 33°. 

Now, if we imagine the lines AB and BC, then the angle between AB and BC (which is angle ABC) would depend on the direction of AB and BC relative to the parallel lines. Suppose that line AB is going upwards from line l, making 38° with l, and line BC is going downwards from line m, making 33° with m. Depending on the orientation, these angles could add up or subtract to give angle ABC.

Wait, if lines l and m are horizontal, for example. Let me assume that line l is horizontal, so line m is also horizontal. Point A is on line l, point C is on line m. Line AB goes upward from A, making 38° with line l (so it's going up at 38° above horizontal). Then line BC goes from B to C on line m. If line BC makes a 33° angle with line m (which is horizontal), then depending on the direction, it could be going downward or upward. Assuming that the lines are arranged such that angle ABC is formed between AB and BC, then the total angle at B would be the difference between the angles made with the horizontal lines.

Wait, if line AB is rising at 38° from line l, and line BC is falling at 33° from line m, then the angle between AB and BC would be 38° + 33° = 71°. That would make sense. Because if you imagine AB going up at 38° from l, and BC going down at 33° from m, the angle between them would be the sum of those two angles. Hence, angle ABC is 38 + 33 = 71°, which would be option D.

But wait, why would the angle be the sum? Let me verify. If line l and line m are parallel, and AB is inclined at 38° above line l, while BC is inclined at 33° below line m. Since lines l and m are parallel, the inclination of BC with respect to line m is equivalent to its inclination with respect to line l. So, if AB is going up at 38° from l, and BC is going down at 33° from m (which is parallel to l), then the angle between AB and BC would be 38° + 33° = 71°. Therefore, angle ABC is 71°, which matches option D.

Alternatively, if the angles were on the same side, maybe they'd subtract, but given that they're on different sides (one above line l, one below line m), adding makes sense. So, the measure of angle ABC is 38 + 33 = 71°, hence answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle ABC$, we start by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

- **Lines $l$** and **$m$** are parallel.
- **Point $A$** lies on line $l$, and **point $C$** lies on line $m$.
- **$\angle DAB = 38^\circ$**, meaning the angle between line segment $AB$ and the line $l$ at point $A$ is $38^\circ$.
- **$\angle BCH = 33^\circ$**, meaning the angle between line segment $BC$ and the line $m$ at point $C$ is $33^\circ$.
- **Lines $AB$** and **$BC$** connect points $A$ to $B$ and $B$ to $C$, respectively.
- Thus, $\angle ABC$ is the angle between segments $AB$ and $BC$ at vertex $B$.

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

We interpret the configuration as follows:

- Line $l$ contains point $A$, and line $m$ contains point $C$. These lines are **parallel**.
- Segment $AB$ originates from point $A$ on line $l$ and extends toward point $B$.
- Segment $BC$ originates from point $B$ and terminates at point $C$ on line $m$.
- Angles $\angle DAB = 38^\circ$ and $\angle BCH = 33^\circ$ are formed between segments $AB$ and $l$, and between $BC$ and $m$, respectively.

Because lines $l$ and $m$ are parallel, and $AB$ and $BC$ act as transversals, we can apply the **properties of angles formed by transversals with parallel lines**.

Assume that:

- Segment $AB$ forms an angle of $38^\circ$ with line $l$ (i.e., at point $A$).
- Segment $BC$ forms an angle of $33^\circ$ with line $m$ (i.e., at point $C$).

These two angles represent the angles between each segment and the respective parallel line, and they occur on **opposite sides** of the parallel lines (as shown by the placement of points $D$ on $l$ and $H$ on $m$).

Thus, the total angle between the two segments $AB$ and $BC$ — i.e., $\angle ABC$ — is the **sum** of these two angles:

$$
\angle ABC = \angle DAB + \angle BCH = 38^\circ + 33^\circ = 71^\circ
$$

### Final Conclusion

The measure of $\angle ABC$ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{71}
