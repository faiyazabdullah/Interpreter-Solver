MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a square ABCD with points A, B, C, D. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA form the sides of the square. Also, there's a diagonal AC mentioned, which is a diagonal of the square. The problem gives several constraints and asks for the measure of angle ABC (which is y). Let me break it down step by step.

First, since it's a square, all sides should be equal, right? But wait, there's some specific information here. It says that Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) and so on for all sides. That makes sense because in a square, all sides are congruent. Then they mention that the length of diagonal AC is 13. Also, they say that the length of DA equals the lengths of AB, BC, CD, etc., so DA is congruent to each side. Wait, but in a square, the diagonals are longer than the sides. The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the formula side * sqrt(2). Since the diagonal AC is 13, maybe I can find the side length first?

Let me denote the length of each side as 's'. Then the diagonal would be s√2. Given that the diagonal is 13, so:

s√2 = 13  
Therefore, s = 13 / √2

But sometimes rationalizing the denominator, that's (13√2)/2. However, maybe I don't need to compute the exact value yet. 

Now, the question is about angle ABC. In a square, all angles are right angles, right? Because squares have four right angles. Wait, but angle ABC is at point B, between points A, B, C. Wait, but in a square, angle ABC is a corner of the square, so it should be 90 degrees. But then why is the answer choices including 45 and others? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem mentions that Angle(B,C,D) is a right angle. Wait, angle at point C between points B, C, D. Wait, in a square, angle at C is also a right angle. But that seems redundant. Hmm. Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Wait, the problem says that line AC is a diagonal of the square. So, in a square, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees? No, actually, the diagonals of a square intersect at 90 degrees only if they are perpendicular. Wait, no, in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, and they are perpendicular. Wait, yes! In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So the angle between the two diagonals is 90 degrees. But angle ABC is a corner angle, which is 90 degrees. Wait, but then why is the problem giving us that the diagonal AC has length 13 and asking for angle ABC? That seems like it's just a standard right angle. But then why is there confusion here?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again. The problem states that Angle(B,C,D) is a right angle. But angle at point C between B-C-D. Which is the same as angle BCD, which in a square is indeed a right angle. So that's consistent. But angle ABC is another right angle. So why is the problem asking for angle ABC? Unless there's some trick here.

Alternatively, maybe the figure isn't a square? Wait, the initial statement says Square(A,B,C,D), so it's definitely a square. All sides equal, all angles right angles. Therefore, angle ABC is 90 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, option D is 90. So why would the problem give all those constraints about the diagonal being 13? Because maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, maybe the figure isn't a square? Wait, the problem says Square(A,B,C,D), so it's a square. But let me re-examine the constraints again. The problem says:

- Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) – so AB=BC
- Congruent(Line(B,C), Line(C,D)) – BC=CD
- Congruent(Line(C,D), Line(D,A)) – CD=DA
So all sides are congruent. Hence, it's a rhombus. But since all angles are right angles, it's a square. Therefore, angle ABC is 90 degrees. But then why is the problem involving the diagonal AC? Because in a square, the diagonal divides it into two 45-45-90 triangles. Wait, but angle ABC is still 90 degrees. So unless there's some misinterpretation here.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a different angle? Let me check again. The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is y. So angle at point B, between points A-B-C. Which is angle ABC. Which in a square is 90 degrees. So the answer should be D. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, could there be a miscalculation due to the diagonal's length? For example, suppose that the diagonal is 13, so the sides are 13/√2, but does that affect the angles? No, because angles in a square are always 90 degrees regardless of the side length. So even if the diagonal is 13, the angles remain right angles. Therefore, angle ABC is 90 degrees. Hence, answer D.

Wait, but maybe the problem is not a square? Wait, the initial constraints say Square(A,B,C,D), so it's a square. But perhaps there's an error in the problem's constraints? For instance, maybe the figure is a rectangle? But the problem says it's a square. Alternatively, maybe the diagonal is not AC? Wait, the problem says IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,C), Square(A,B,C,D)), so AC is a diagonal. So in a square, diagonals are equal. So all that holds.

But then why is the problem giving all these constraints? Maybe there's a trick. Wait, perhaps the figure isn't a square but a rhombus? Wait, but the problem says Square(A,B,C,D). So it's a square. So all angles are right angles. So angle ABC is 90 degrees. Therefore, answer D.

Wait, but maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking it's a square but it's actually a different shape? Let me check again. The problem says Square(A,B,C,D), so that's a square. All sides congruent, all angles right angles. Diagonals are equal and intersect at 90 degrees. So angle ABC is 90 degrees. So answer D. But the answer choices include D as 90. So the answer should be D. However, sometimes problems might have nuances. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe angle ABC refers to something else. For example, in a square, if you draw the diagonal AC, then triangle ABC is a right triangle. Wait, but angle ABC is still 90 degrees. Wait, triangle ABC would have AB and BC as legs, and AC as hypotenuse. So angle at B is still 90 degrees. So regardless of the diagonal, angle ABC remains 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure y is 90 degrees. So answer D.

But why does the problem mention the diagonal AC and its length? Because maybe there was confusion between a square and a diamond? Or perhaps the problem had a typo and meant a different quadrilateral? But according to the given constraints, it's a square. Therefore, answer D. But let me check once again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in three dimensions? But no, it's talking about points A,B,C,D connected as a square, so it's planar. Therefore, angle ABC is 90 degrees. Hence, Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem involves a square $ABCD$ with all sides congruent and all internal angles measuring $90^\circ$. Key constraints include:

1. **All sides are congruent**: $AB = BC = CD = DA$, confirming it's a square.
2. **Diagonal $AC$**: The diagonal connects opposite vertices $A$ and $C$, splitting the square into two congruent right triangles ($\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ADC$).
3. **Diagonal length**: The length of diagonal $AC$ is given as 13. This aligns with the property of a square’s diagonal being $s\sqrt{2}$, where $s$ is the side length. Solving $s\sqrt{2} = 13$ confirms the side length, but this does not alter the angular measures.

**Focus on Angle $ABC$**:
- Angle $ABC$ is formed at vertex $B$ by sides $AB$ and $BC$. 
- In a square, every internal angle is $90^\circ$, regardless of side lengths or diagonal measures. 
- The presence of the diagonal $AC$ does not change the measure of angle $ABC$, as it is inherently part of the square’s structure.

**Conclusion**:
The measure of angle $ABC$ is $90^\circ$, making the correct answer **D**.

Final Answer: D
