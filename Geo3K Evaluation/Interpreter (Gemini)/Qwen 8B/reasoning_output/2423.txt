MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have an isosceles triangle ABC where AB is congruent to BC. The question is asking for the value of AB, which I think is represented by x here. Let me go through the given information step by step.

First, the problem states that triangle ABC is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. That means two sides are equal. Since AB and BC are congruent, those are the two equal sides. Wait, but in an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are called the legs, and the third side is the base. But depending on the vertex angles, the base can vary. However, since AB and BC are congruent, then the base would be AC.

Now, looking at the equations provided:

They mention that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals Sub(Mul(2,x),7). Let me parse that. Sub(Mul(2,x),7) translates to 2x - 7. Similarly, LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is Sub(Mul(4,x),21), which is 4x - 21. And LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is Sub(x,3), so x - 3.

But since AB ≅ BC, their lengths should be equal. Therefore, setting the expressions for AB and BC equal to each other:

AB = 2x - 7
BC = 4x - 21

So, 2x - 7 = 4x - 21. Let me solve for x here.

Subtracting 2x from both sides: -7 = 2x - 21

Then adding 21 to both sides: 14 = 2x → x = 7.

Wait, so x is 7? Then substituting back into AB's length: 2*(7) -7 = 14 -7 = 7. And BC is 4*7 -21 = 28 -21=7. So that checks out. So AB and BC are both 7 units long. 

But wait, the question says "Find AB if triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB ≅ BC." So AB is 7? But let me check if there's more to it. Also, they mentioned that the third side AC is x -3. If x is 7, then AC is 7-3=4. So sides are AB=7, BC=7, AC=4. That makes sense as an isosceles triangle. 

But let me make sure there are no contradictions. For example, triangle inequality. The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So AB + BC > AC: 7+7>4 → 14>4, which holds. AB + AC > BC: 7+4=11>7, yes. BC + AC > AB: same as above. So all good.

But wait, maybe I need to check if there's another scenario where AB could be different? Like, perhaps AB and BC being congruent could mean different configurations? Wait, in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. Here, AB and BC are the ones said to be congruent. So that's fixed. So the only variable here is x, which we solved as 7. Hence AB is 7. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 7. So the answer should be C.

But let me double-check my steps again. The key was equating AB and BC because they are congruent. The expressions for AB and BC are given in terms of x. Solving gives x=7. Then AB is 2x-7=7. So yes, AB is 7. Therefore, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ AB $ in the isosceles triangle $ \triangle ABC $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We're told:

- Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is **isosceles**, with $ AB \cong BC $
- The lengths of the sides are expressed in terms of a variable $ x $:
  - $ AB = 2x - 7 $
  - $ BC = 4x - 21 $
  - $ AC = x - 3 $

Since $ AB \cong BC $, their lengths must be equal:

$$
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
$$

---

### **Step 2: Solve the Equation**

$$
2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \\
\Rightarrow -7 + 21 = 4x - 2x \\
\Rightarrow 14 = 2x \\
\Rightarrow x = 7
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Length of $ AB $**

Using $ x = 7 $, substitute into the expression for $ AB $:

$$
AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7
$$

Thus, the length of $ AB $ is $ 7 $.

---

### **Step 4: Verify Consistency with Triangle Inequality (Optional Check)**

Let’s confirm that the values satisfy the triangle inequality:

- $ AB = 7 $
- $ BC = 7 $
- $ AC = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 $

Check:
- $ AB + BC = 7 + 7 = 14 > 4 = AC $
- $ AB + AC = 7 + 4 = 11 > 7 = BC $
- $ BC + AC = 7 + 4 = 11 > 7 = AB $

All inequalities hold true.

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of $ AB $ is $ 7 $. This matches **Answer Choice C**.

$$
\boxed{C}
$$
