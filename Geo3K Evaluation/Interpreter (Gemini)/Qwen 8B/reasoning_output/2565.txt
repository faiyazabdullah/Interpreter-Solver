Find \tan X.

CHOICES:
A. \frac { 5 } { 12 }
B. \frac { 12 } { 13 }
C. \frac { 17 } { 12 }
D. \frac { 12 } { 5 }

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find tan X based on the given geometric constraints. So first, I need to parse all the information provided here. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

We have a triangle named Triangle(A,X,B). The points A, X, and B are all defined as points. There are lines connecting them: Line(A,X), Line(X,B), and Line(A,B). Also, there's an angle mentioned, Angle(X,A,B), which is a right angle. So that tells me that triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle at point A? Wait, no—wait, the angle is at X,A,B. Wait, angles are typically denoted with the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(X,A,B) would mean the angle at point A between points X and B. Wait, but the notation can sometimes be confusing. Let me think again. In standard notation, Angle(X,A,B) is the angle at point A formed by the segments AX and AB. But since it's stated that this angle is a right angle, so that means angle at A is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle AXB has a right angle at A. 

But then the problem says Right(Triangle(A,X,B)), which confirms that the triangle is right-angled. Now, they also mention Perpendicular(Line(A,X), Line(A,B)). Since line AX and line AB are perpendicular, that makes sense because the right angle is at A. So lines AX and AB form the legs of the right triangle, and XB is the hypotenuse. Wait, but the problem states IsHypotenuseOf(Line(X,B), Triangle(A,X,B)), meaning that line XB is the hypotenuse. That aligns with the right angle at A. So in triangle AXB, the hypotenuse is XB, and the legs are AX and AB.

Now, we're given specific lengths: Length of AX is 5 units, length of XB is 13 units. Wait, hold on. If XB is the hypotenuse, then according to Pythagoras theorem, the sum of squares of the legs should equal the square of the hypotenuse. Let me check that. So if AX = 5, and AB is another leg, then:

AX² + AB² = XB²  
So 5² + AB² = 13²  
Which gives AB² = 169 - 25 = 144  
Therefore, AB = sqrt(144) = 12. So AB is 12 units long.

Now, the question asks for tan(X). Wait, angle X. Wait, angle X refers to which angle? In the context of triangle AXB, the angles are at points A, X, and B. But the problem mentions TanOf(Angle(X)), so that would be the tangent of the angle at point X. So angle at X in triangle AXB.

In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. Let me recall: For angle X, which is at point X. Wait, the triangle is right-angled at A. So the right angle is at A. Then the other two angles are at X and B. So angle at X and angle at B. We need to find tan(angle at X).

Let me visualize the triangle. Let me sketch mentally: right-angled at A, with legs AX (length 5) and AB (length 12), hypotenuse XB (length 13). So angle at X is one of the non-right angles. To find tan(angle at X), we need to identify the opposite and adjacent sides relative to angle X.

In triangle AXB, angle at X: the sides forming this angle are AX and XB. Wait, no. Wait, angle at X is formed by the sides XA and XB. Wait, maybe I should label the triangle properly.

Points: A is the right-angle vertex. So, imagine point A, connected to X and B. So AX and AB are the legs. Then XB connects X to B, the hypotenuse. So angle at X is between side AX and XB. Wait, but when considering trigonometric ratios, for angle X, the opposite side would be AB, and the adjacent side would be AX. Because in relation to angle X, the opposite side is the side opposite to X, which is AB. And the adjacent side is AX. Wait, let me confirm.

Alternatively, using standard definitions: in a right-angled triangle, for an acute angle θ, tanθ = opposite / adjacent. So for angle X, which is at vertex X. The sides relative to angle X: the side opposite to angle X is AB (since AB is opposite to X), and the side adjacent to angle X is AX. Therefore, tan(angle X) = AB / AX.

Given that AB is 12 and AX is 5, then tan(X) = 12/5. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 12/5. However, wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the sides.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. Let me consider the triangle again. The right angle is at A. So angle at A is 90°, angles at X and B are complementary. So angle X and angle B add up to 90°. 

For angle X, which is at point X. The sides adjacent to angle X are the ones forming the angle. So angle X is formed by the sides XA and XB. Wait, but in terms of the triangle, the sides adjacent to angle X would be the legs adjacent to X. Wait, perhaps I need to use the definition more carefully.

Another approach: Let's denote the triangle with right angle at A. So vertices A, X, B. So AX and AB are the legs, XB is the hypotenuse. Then angle at X is one of the acute angles. Let's denote angle at X as θ. Then tan(theta) is equal to the opposite side over adjacent side. Which sides?

Opposite to angle X is AB. Adjacent to angle X is AX. Therefore, tan(theta) = AB / AX = 12 / 5. Which would be 12/5, corresponding to answer D. But wait, let me cross-check with the Pythagorean triple. Since 5, 12, 13 is a classic Pythagorean triple. So the sides are 5, 12, 13. So yes, AX=5, AB=12, XB=13. So angle at X: opposite side AB=12, adjacent side AX=5. Hence tan(theta)=12/5. So answer D. 

But wait, the answer choices include D as 12/5. But let me check again if I got the ratio reversed. Sometimes confusion arises about which side is opposite or adjacent. Alternatively, maybe I should compute using coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to verify. Let’s place point A at (0,0). Since AX is a leg of length 5, and AB is another leg of length 12. Assuming the right angle is at A. So if AX is along the x-axis, then point X could be at (5,0). Point B would be along the y-axis at (0,12). Then the hypotenuse XB connects (5,0) to (0,12). The length of XB would be sqrt((5)^2 + (12)^2) = sqrt(25+144)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches the given data.

Now, angle at X. Let's find tan(angle at X). To calculate tan(theta) where theta is angle at X. Let me think: In coordinate system, point X is at (5,0). The angle at X is between segments XA and XB. Vector XA goes from X to A: A is (0,0), so vector XA is (-5, 0). Vector XB goes from X to B: B is (0,12), so vector XB is (-5, 12). 

To find the angle between vectors XA and XB at point X. The tangent of this angle can be found by considering the slope of the lines or using trigonometry. Alternatively, in triangle AXB, using the sides. 

Alternatively, in triangle AXB, angle at X. Using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines? Well, since it's a right triangle, better to stick with basic trigonometry. 

The angle at X: in triangle AXB, the sides are AX=5, AB=12, XB=13. The angle at X is opposite to AB. Wait, AB is opposite angle X. So in triangle terminology, sin(theta) = opposite / hypotenuse = AB / XB = 12/13. cos(theta) = adjacent / hypotenuse = AX / XB = 5/13. Therefore tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (12/13)/(5/13) = 12/5. So same conclusion, tan(theta) = 12/5. So answer D.

But wait, the answer choices have D as 12/5. However, let me check again the problem statement to ensure I didn't misread anything. The problem says:

"Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(X,B))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(A,X))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(A,B)))))"

Which checks out with 13² = 5² + 12². So that's correct. So AB is indeed 12. So tan(angle X) is 12/5. So answer D.

But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option D is 12/5. So that's the answer. However, let me check if the question was asking for tan(angle at X) or something else. The problem says:

"Equals(TanOf(Angle(X)), RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(A,X))))"

Wait, according to the problem, the last constraint is that tan(angle X) equals the ratio of AB over AX. Which is exactly what we computed. So that's consistent. Therefore, tan(angle X) is AB / AX = 12/5. So answer D. 

But let me check once again if I interpreted Angle(X) correctly. The problem defines Angle(X) as Angle(X,A,B). Wait, earlier analysis said that Angle(X,A,B) is the angle at A. Wait, hold on! This might be a critical mistake. 

Wait, the problem says: "Angle(X,A,B)" which is the angle at point A, between points X and B. So that's the right angle. So angle at A is the right angle, so the angle at A is 90 degrees. Then, the problem says that this angle is a right angle. So the triangle is right-angled at A. Therefore, the other angles are at X and B. 

Thus, the question asks for tan(X), which is the tangent of the angle at X. So angle at X. So my previous reasoning holds. So tan(angle at X) is AB / AX. Which is 12/5. So answer D. 

But let me double-check if angle X is at point X. Yes, the problem says "TanOf(Angle(X))", which would refer to the angle at point X. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be D. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are:

A. 5/12  
B. 12/13  
C. 17/12  
D. 12/5  

Yes, D is 12/5. So the answer is D. 

However, just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose someone thought angle X is at point X, but confused which sides are opposite and adjacent. For example, if someone thought the opposite side is AX and adjacent is AB. But that would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, suppose someone thought the angle at X is between AX and XB, so the opposite side would be AB, and adjacent is AX. So tan(theta) = AB / AX = 12/5. Correct. 

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly took AX as the opposite and AB as adjacent, they'd get 5/12, which is answer A. But that would be wrong. 

Therefore, unless there's some misunderstanding in the problem setup, D seems correct. 

Another way to think: in the right triangle, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent. Theta is angle at X. Opposite side is AB = 12. Adjacent side is AX = 5. So tan(theta) = 12/5. 

Yes, that's solid. Therefore, Final Answer: D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $\tan(\angle X)$ in the given right triangle $ \triangle AXB $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying fundamental trigonometric principles.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

From the constraints, we know:
- Triangle $ \triangle AXB $ is right-angled at point $ A $.
- The sides of the triangle are:
  - $ \text{AX} = 5 $
  - $ \text{XB} = 13 $ (hypotenuse)
  - $ \text{AB} = ? $

Using the **Pythagorean Theorem**:
$$
\text{AX}^2 + \text{AB}^2 = \text{XB}^2 \\
5^2 + \text{AB}^2 = 13^2 \\
25 + \text{AB}^2 = 169 \\
\text{AB}^2 = 144 \\
\Rightarrow \text{AB} = \sqrt{144} = 12
$$

So, the sides of the triangle are:
- $ \text{AX} = 5 $
- $ \text{AB} = 12 $
- $ \text{XB} = 13 $

This corresponds to a well-known Pythagorean triple $ (5, 12, 13) $.

---

### **Step 2: Determining $\tan(\angle X)$**

We are asked to compute $ \tan(\angle X) $. In triangle $ \triangle AXB $, the angle at point $ X $ is one of the acute angles. From the definition of tangent in a right triangle:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Here, for $ \angle X $:
- The **opposite** side is $ AB = 12 $
- The **adjacent** side is $ AX = 5 $

Thus,
$$
\tan(\angle X) = \frac{AB}{AX} = \frac{12}{5}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Verifying with Given Constraints**

The final constraint explicitly states:
$$
\text{Equals}( \tan(\angle X), \text{RatioOf}(\text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A,B)), \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A,X))) )
$$

This confirms that:
$$
\tan(\angle X) = \frac{AB}{AX} = \frac{12}{5}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying through multiple approaches — direct computation via the definition of tangent in a right triangle, application of the Pythagorean Theorem, and validation against the given constraints — we conclude that the value of $ \tan(\angle X) $ is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{12}{5}}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**  
$\boxed{D}$
