MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pentagon with points B, C, H, G, D. Then there are several angles mentioned: Angle(F,B,C), Angle(I,C,H), Angle(A,H,G), Angle(E,G,D), and Angle(J,D,B). Each of these angles has a measure related to x. The key equation given is that the sum of these five angles equals 360 degrees. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the setup correctly. Since it's a pentagon, but the angles listed don't seem to be the internal angles of the pentagon directly. Wait, maybe they are? Let me think. In a pentagon, the sum of internal angles is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. But here, the sum of these specific angles is given as 360. That seems conflicting. Hmm. Maybe these angles aren't all the internal angles of the pentagon. Or perhaps some of them are external?

Wait, the problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,C),x+4) etc. So each of those angles is measured at different vertices. Let me try to visualize the pentagon. The points mentioned are B, C, H, G, D. So connecting these points in order? Not sure about the exact shape, but the angles given involve different vertices. For example, Angle(F,B,C): so vertex at B, with sides BF and BC. Similarly for others. 

But since the problem gives the sum of these five angles as 360, which is the total for a full circle around a point. Wait, that might mean that these angles are arranged around a common point? Or maybe they form a star or something else. Alternatively, maybe the sum of these angles equals the total of some kind of rotation around a point, hence 360 degrees. 

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are the exterior angles of the pentagon? Wait, but the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees. However, in that case, if these five angles were the exterior angles, then their sum would be 360. But in that case, the problem states that the sum of these five angles is equal to 360. So maybe that's the key here. 

So if each of these angles is an exterior angle of the pentagon, then their sum should be 360. Therefore, the equation given is SumOf(x+4, x, x-6, x+10, 56) = 360. Let me check that. 

Let me write down the equation:

Sum = (x + 4) + x + (x - 6) + (x + 10) + 56 = 360

Combine like terms:

First, expand all terms:

x + 4 + x + x - 6 + x + 10 + 56

Combine x terms: 1x + 1x + 1x + 1x = 4x

Constant terms: 4 -6 +10 +56. Let me compute that:

4 -6 is -2; -2 +10 is 8; 8 +56 is 64.

Therefore total sum is 4x + 64 = 360

Then solving for x:

4x = 360 - 64 = 296

x = 296 / 4 = 74.

So x would be 74. Now checking the answer choices, option C is 74. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me make sure that my assumption is correct. 

The problem says that the sum of these five angles equals 360. If these are the exterior angles of the pentagon, then yes, their sum is 360. But does that hold? Because normally, for a convex polygon, the sum of exterior angles is 360 regardless of the number of sides. However, in this case, the pentagon may not be convex. But even so, the sum of exterior angles is still 360 degrees. 

However, another thought: could these angles be the internal angles? Then their sum would be 540 degrees. But the problem states that their sum is 360, so that can't be. Hence, they must be exterior angles. Therefore, solving the equation gives x=74, which corresponds to option C. 

Wait, but let me check again the problem statement. It says "MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,C),x+4)" etc. So each of these angles is a specific angle. Are these exterior angles? For instance, Angle(F,B,C) would be an angle at point B between points F and C. But unless F is a point on the extension of a side, it's unclear. But perhaps the problem is structured such that each of these angles is an exterior angle. 

Alternatively, maybe they are not exterior angles, but some other set of angles whose sum is 360. However, without more information about the figure, the only way the sum can be 360 is if they are exterior angles. Otherwise, if they are internal angles, the sum would be 540. Therefore, the equation given is likely based on the fact that these are exterior angles. 

Thus, solving the equation leads us to x=74. Let me verify once again the calculation:

Original equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x - 6) + (x + 10) + 56 = 360

Adding up:

x + 4 + x + x -6 + x +10 +56 = 4x + (4 -6 +10 +56) = 4x + 64 = 360

Yes, 4x = 360 - 64 = 296 → x = 74. 

Looking at the answer choices, C is 74. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration and the relationship between the angles specified in the problem.

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We're told that the measures of five specific angles are expressed in terms of $ x $:

- $ \angle(F,B,C) = x + 4 $
- $ \angle(I,C,H) = x $
- $ \angle(A,H,G) = x - 6 $
- $ \angle(E,G,D) = x + 10 $
- $ \angle(J,D,B) = 56 $

Additionally, we're informed that:

$$
\text{Sum of these angles} = 360^\circ
$$

This implies that the total of these five angle measures equals $ 360^\circ $. This matches the property that the **sum of the exterior angles** of any polygon is always $ 360^\circ $, suggesting that the angles in question represent the **exterior angles** of a polygon — in this case, a pentagon.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation**

Using the expressions for each angle, we write:

$$
(x + 4) + x + (x - 6) + (x + 10) + 56 = 360
$$

Now simplify the left-hand side:

- Combine the variables:  
  $ x + x + x + x = 4x $

- Combine constants:  
  $ 4 - 6 + 10 + 56 = 64 $

So the equation becomes:

$$
4x + 64 = 360
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Subtract 64 from both sides:

$$
4x = 360 - 64 = 296
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
x = \frac{296}{4} = 74
$$

---

### **Step 4: Select the Correct Answer Choice**

From the given answer choices:

- A. 56  
- B. 68  
- C. 74  
- D. 84  

The computed value of $ x = 74 $ matches **option C**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Since the angles described correspond to the exterior angles of a pentagon and their sum is given as $ 360^\circ $, the algebraic solution confirms that $ x = 74 $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
