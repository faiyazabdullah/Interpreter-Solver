MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given here. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, it says that Triangle(A,B,C) is a right triangle. The right angle is at point C because Angle(A,C,B) is a RightAngle. Wait, angles are named with three points, so Angle(A,C,B) would mean the angle at point C between points A and B. So that makes sense; the right angle is at vertex C. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. 

Now, they mention that Line(A,B) is the hypotenuse because IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)). Since the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, which is at C, then the hypotenuse should be AB. That checks out because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. So sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.

They also give some length equalities. Length of line BC is x (which we need to find). Length of AC is 4 units, and length of AB is 16 units. Also, there's a statement that the square of AB equals the sum of squares of AC and BC. Wait, but that's the Pythagorean theorem! So according to Pythagoras, in a right-angled triangle, (hypotenuse)^2 = (leg1)^2 + (leg2)^2. Here, AB is the hypotenuse, so:

AB² = AC² + BC²

We know AB is 16, AC is 4, and BC is x. Plugging these values in:

16² = 4² + x²  
Calculating each term:

16 squared is 256, 4 squared is 16. So:

256 = 16 + x²  
Subtracting 16 from both sides gives:

x² = 256 - 16 = 240  
Therefore, x = sqrt(240)

But sqrt(240) can be simplified. Let's factor 240 into prime factors. 240 divided by 4 is 60, so sqrt(4*60) = 2*sqrt(60). Then 60 can be broken down further into 4*15, so sqrt(4*15) = 2*sqrt(15). Therefore, combining those steps, sqrt(240) becomes 2*sqrt(60) which simplifies to 2*2*sqrt(15) = 4*sqrt(15). Wait, wait, hold on. Let me check again.

Wait, original calculation: x²=240, so x=sqrt(240). Simplify sqrt(240):

Breakdown: 240 = 16 * 15. Because 16*15 is 240. Yes, since 16*10=160, 16*15=240. Therefore sqrt(16*15)=sqrt(16)*sqrt(15)=4*sqrt(15). Therefore, x is 4√15. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 4√15. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me go through again. Given AB is hypotenuse, so AB² = AC² + BC². AB is 16, so 16² is 256. AC is 4, so 4² is 16. Then BC² = 256 -16 = 240. Therefore BC is sqrt(240). Which simplifies as follows:

sqrt(240) = sqrt(16 * 15) = 4*sqrt(15). So yes, that's correct. So x is 4√15. Looking at the options, answer C is 4√15. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me check the answer choices again:

A. 2√15 ≈ 2*3.872 ≈ 7.744

B. 2√17 ≈ 2*4.123 ≈ 8.246

C. 4√15 ≈ 4*3.872 ≈ 15.488

D. 4√17 ≈ 4*4.123 ≈ 16.492

But our calculation gives x as sqrt(240) ≈ 15.491... which is approximately 15.49. Comparing with the options, option C is 4√15 ≈ 15.49, which matches. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, let me confirm once more. Did I misread any part of the problem?

The problem states that Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C)). Since the right angle is at C, lines AC and BC are perpendicular. So that's consistent with being legs of the right triangle. All the constraints seem to align with a standard right triangle setup. Therefore, using Pythagoras is valid here. 

So yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the value of x is 4√15, which corresponds to option C. Hence, the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We're told:
- Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle**.
- The **right angle** is at vertex $ C $, i.e., $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $.
- Side $ AB $ is the **hypotenuse**, and sides $ AC $ and $ BC $ are the **legs** of the triangle.
- We are given:
  - $ \text{Length}(AC) = 4 $
  - $ \text{Length}(AB) = 16 $
  - $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $ (this is the unknown we want to find).

---

### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship among the sides is governed by the **Pythagorean Theorem**:

$$
\text{(Hypotenuse)}^2 = \text{(Leg}_1)^2 + \text{(Leg}_2)^2
$$

Applying this to triangle $ ABC $, where $ AB $ is the hypotenuse and $ AC $, $ BC $ are the legs:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
16^2 = 4^2 + x^2 \\
256 = 16 + x^2
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x^2 = 256 - 16 = 240 \\
x = \sqrt{240}
$$

Now simplify $ \sqrt{240} $:

$$
\sqrt{240} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 15} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{15} = 4\sqrt{15}
$$

Thus, $ x = 4\sqrt{15} $

---

### **Step 4: Match with Answer Choices**

From the list of options:
- A. $ 2\sqrt{15} $
- B. $ 2\sqrt{17} $
- C. $ 4\sqrt{15} $
- D. $ 4\sqrt{17} $

Only **option C** matches the exact expression $ 4\sqrt{15} $.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
