MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So we have a quadrilateral WXYZ, right? And we're given the measures of each angle in terms of x. The angles at points X, Y, W, and Z are measured as x, 2x, 3x, and 4x respectively. Also, the sum of all these angles equals 360 degrees because it's a quadrilateral. Wait, but hold on—quadrilaterals have interior angles that add up to 360 degrees. Yeah, that's a key point here.

So the problem says that the sum of the measures of angles X, Y, W, and Z is equal to 360 degrees. Let me write that down. 

The measure of angle X is x, angle Y is 2x, angle W is 3x, and angle Z is 4x. Therefore, adding them together:

x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 360 degrees.

Let me compute the left side. Combining like terms:

x + 2x is 3x, plus another 3x makes 6x, then plus 4x gives 10x. So total sum is 10x = 360 degrees. To find x, divide both sides by 10:

x = 360 / 10 = 36 degrees.

Wait, so x is 36 degrees? Then the question asks for the measure of angle W, which is 3x. So substituting x=36 into 3x gives 3*36 = 108 degrees. Hmm, looking at the answer choices, option D is 108. But wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, verifying the sum of angles: x + 2x + 3x +4x = 10x. Correct. 10x=360 => x=36. Then angle W is 3x, so 3*36=108. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe there's something wrong here? Because sometimes problems might involve different types of quadrilaterals, but the problem didn't specify any particular type. It just mentions a general quadrilateral. However, regardless of the type, the sum of interior angles is always 360 degrees. So that part holds.

But let me check if there's a possibility that the angles are exterior angles? No, the problem states "MeasureOf(Angle(X))", etc., which typically refers to interior angles unless specified otherwise. Also, the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees, but that's only for convex polygons and applies per vertex. However, since the problem mentions four angles adding up to 360, and they are labeled as angles at each vertex (X, Y, W, Z), it's safe to assume they are interior angles. Hence, their sum should be 360. So my calculation seems correct.

Therefore, angle W is 3x, which would be 108 degrees. Looking at the options, D is 108. So the answer should be D. Wait, but let me check again the problem statement once more to ensure I didn't misread anything.

Problem says: MeasureOf(Angle(X), x). So angle X is x. Angle Y is 2x, angle W is 3x, angle Z is 4x. Sum is 360. So yes, 10x=360, x=36. Then angle W is 3x=108. So answer is D. But wait, the answer choices include D as 108. So that's correct.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the problem? For example, if someone thought that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 180, but no—that's for triangles. Quadrilaterals are 360. So that's correct. Another possible mistake could be miscalculating the coefficients. Let me recheck:

Angle X: x

Angle Y: 2x → total so far x+2x=3x

Angle W: 3x → total now 3x +3x=6x

Angle Z: 4x → total 6x +4x=10x. Yes, that's correct.

Thus, 10x=360 ⇒ x=36. So angle W is 3x=108. Therefore, answer is D. So I think that's solid. Unless there's some trick here, but the problem seems straightforward. Maybe the problem is designed to test understanding that the sum is 360, leading to solving for x and then multiplying. So yeah, D is correct.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle W $ in quadrilateral $WXYZ$, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- The angles at vertices $W, X, Y,$ and $Z$ are expressed in terms of a variable $x$:  
  $$
  \angle X = x,\quad \angle Y = 2x,\quad \angle W = 3x,\quad \angle Z = 4x
  $$

- The sum of the interior angles of **any** quadrilateral is always:
  $$
  360^\circ
  $$

---

### Step 1: Set Up the Equation

Using the expressions for the angles:
$$
\angle X + \angle Y + \angle W + \angle Z = 360^\circ
$$
Substitute the values in terms of $x$:
$$
x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 360^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the Expression

Combine like terms:
$$
x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 10x
$$
So,
$$
10x = 360^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $x$

Divide both sides by 10:
$$
x = \frac{360}{10} = 36^\circ
$$

---

### Step 4: Find $m\angle W$

Since $\angle W = 3x$, substitute $x = 36^\circ$:
$$
m\angle W = 3 \times 36^\circ = 108^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$

Final Answer: D
