MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle S with points P, Q, R, T. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, all points P, Q, R lie on the circle S. That means they're points on the circumference of the circle. Then there's point T, which I need to consider. The line PR is drawn, and line QT is another line. Also, it says that QT is perpendicular to PR. Additionally, T is the midpoint of PR. Wait, no—it says IsMidpointOf(T, Line(P,R))? Or maybe it's saying that T is the midpoint? Wait, the original statement was: "IsMidpointOf(T,Line(P,R))"—probably meaning that T is the midpoint of segment PR. But then there's also the condition that the length of TR is 6. And since T is the midpoint, then PT should equal TR. So, LengthOf(Line(P,T)) equals LengthOf(Line(T,R)), which is given as 6. Therefore, PT = TR = 6, so PR is 12 units long. 

Also, there's an arc measure: MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q,R)) is 98 degrees. The question asks for m∠PQ, which I think refers to the measure of arc PQ. Wait, but the notation might be different. Wait, the problem says "m ∠PQR" but actually, looking back at the original question: "Find m ∠PQ." Wait, the user wrote:

"Question: In ⊙S, m ∠PQR = 98. Find m ∠PQ."

Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Because the original mentions MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q,R)) is 9 8. Wait, the initial problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q,R)),98)"—so that's the measure of arc PQR, which is 98 degrees. So, the arc from P to R passing through Q has measure 98 degrees. And the question is asking for m ∠PQ, which probably is the measure of arc PQ. Wait, but arcs are usually denoted with three letters when they are major arcs, but maybe in this case, since PQR is mentioned, perhaps it's referring to the arc from P to R going through Q, which would make sense. So, arc PQR measures 98 degrees. Then the question is to find the measure of arc PQ. 

But let me check again. The problem says:

"In ⊙S, m ∠PQR = 98. Find m ∠PQ."

Wait, maybe there's confusion between angles and arcs. Maybe the question is about the arc PQ, not angle. Alternatively, maybe there's a misstatement. However, the original problem mentions MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q,R)) being 98. So, the arc from P to R via Q is 98 degrees. Then, the question is to find the measure of arc PQ. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the inscribed angle? Wait, the problem says "Find m ∠PQ", which could be ambiguous. But given the context, since the given data involves arcs, likely the question is about arc PQ. Let me proceed under that assumption.

So, given that arc PQR (i.e., arc from P to R passing through Q) is 98 degrees. We need to find arc PQ. Also, there are some other conditions involving points T, lines, etc. Let me see how these can help.

Let me recap the given info:

- Points P, Q, R are on circle S. So, they are all on the circumference.

- Line PR is drawn. Point T is such that it lies on PR, and is the midpoint. Since T is the midpoint of PR, and PR is a chord of the circle. Also, line QT is perpendicular to PR. So, QT ⊥ PR. Also, TR = 6, hence PT = TR = 6, making PR = 12.

Additionally, there's the measure of arc PQR (arc from P to R through Q) is 98 degrees. Also, the measure of arc PQR is equal to the sum of arcs PQ and QR. So, according to the given formula: MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q,R)) = Add(MeasureOf(Arc(P,Q)), MeasureOf(Arc(Q,R))). So, arc PQR = arc PQ + arc QR. Hence, arc PQ + arc QR = 98 degrees. So, if we can find either arc PQ or arc QR, we can get the other. But we need more information.

Now, considering that QT is perpendicular to PR, and T is the midpoint of PR. Let me visualize this. Let me draw circle S, with points P and R on the circle, connected by chord PR. T is the midpoint of PR, so it divides PR into two equal parts. Then, line QT is perpendicular to PR. So, QT is perpendicular to chord PR at its midpoint T. 

Hmm, in circle geometry, if a line is drawn from a point on the circle to the midpoint of a chord, and it's perpendicular to that chord, does that imply something about the position of the point?

Wait, if QT is perpendicular to PR at T, and T is the midpoint of PR, then QT is the perpendicular bisector of chord PR. Now, in a circle, the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, the line QT must pass through the center S of the circle. Wait, because the perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the center. Therefore, since QT is the perpendicular bisector of PR, then S lies somewhere along QT. Therefore, point S is on line QT. 

But wait, the problem states that S is the center of the circle. Wait, the first line says Circle(S)—so S is the center. Therefore, S is the center of the circle. Therefore, since QT is the perpendicular bisector of chord PR, then S lies on QT. Therefore, the line QT passes through the center S. Therefore, points Q, S, T are colinear, with S lying on QT. 

Therefore, QS is a radius of the circle, because S is the center, and Q is on the circle. Therefore, SQ is a radius. Similarly, ST is part of the line QT, which connects Q to T. 

But since T is the midpoint of PR, and QT is perpendicular to PR, then QT is the perpendicular bisector of PR. Thus, S lies on QT. So, the center S is located somewhere on line QT. Therefore, we can use this to find relationships between arcs or angles.

Now, since S is on QT, and QT is perpendicular to PR, then triangle QTS is related to the circle's properties. Let me think. Also, since PR is a chord of the circle, and S is the center, the distance from S to PR is zero? No, because S lies on QT, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR. Therefore, the distance from S to PR is zero? Wait, no. If S is on the perpendicular bisector of PR, then S lies on that line. Therefore, the distance from S to PR is the same as the distance from S to the chord PR, which would be zero only if S is on PR, but that's not necessarily true unless PR is a diameter. Wait, but PR isn't necessarily a diameter. Wait, but if S is on the perpendicular bisector of PR, then S is equidistant from P and R. But since S is the center, SP = SR, which is always true. So, that's consistent. So, the fact that S lies on QT tells us that QT passes through the center.

Now, considering that, perhaps we can relate angles subtended by arcs. For instance, the central angles corresponding to arcs PQ and QR. But how?

Alternatively, since we know that arc PQR is 98 degrees, which is the measure of arc from P to R through Q. Therefore, the arc PQ plus arc QR equals 98 degrees. Also, since we have certain symmetries due to the perpendicularity and midpoints, maybe there's a way to find the relationship between arcs PQ and QR.

Another thought: Since QT is the perpendicular bisector of PR and passes through the center S, then QS is a radius. Also, since T is the midpoint of PR, then ST is the distance from the center S to the chord PR. Wait, but since S is on QT, then ST is part of the line QT. Let me denote that.

Let me try to calculate the length of PR. Earlier, we said that TR = 6, so PR = 12. Therefore, PR is a chord of the circle with length 12. Also, since T is the midpoint, and QT is perpendicular to PR, then in triangle PTR, right-angled at T, we can relate the lengths. Wait, but QT is perpendicular to PR, so triangle QTR is right-angled at T? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since S is on QT, and S is the center, then let's consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to model this situation. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place the circle in coordinate system. Let me assume that point T is at the origin (0,0). Since T is the midpoint of PR, and PR is horizontal (since QT is vertical?), but maybe better to assign coordinates carefully.

Since PR is a chord of the circle with midpoint T. Let me set up coordinates so that T is at (0,0), and PR is horizontal. So, points P and R are symmetric with respect to T. Since PR is 12 units long, then if T is the midpoint, then PT = TR = 6. So, suppose P is (-6, 0), R is (6, 0). Then, T is at (0,0).

Then, line QT is perpendicular to PR. Since PR is horizontal, QT must be vertical. Therefore, line QT is vertical, passing through T(0,0). So, point Q lies somewhere along the vertical line x=0. But since Q is on the circle, and S is the center of the circle, which lies on line QT (the y-axis in this setup). Therefore, the center S is somewhere along the y-axis.

So, coordinates:

- P(-6, 0)

- R(6, 0)

- T(0, 0)

- Q(0, q) for some q, since it's on the vertical line QT.

- Center S is at (0, s) for some s.

Now, since S is the center of the circle, the distances from S to P, Q, R are equal.

So, SP^2 = (x_P - 0)^2 + (y_P - s)^2 = (-6 - 0)^2 + (0 - s)^2 = 36 + s²

Similarly, SQ^2 = (x_Q - 0)^2 + (y_Q - s)^2 = (0 - 0)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (q - s)^2

Since Q is on the circle, SQ must equal SP. So,

(q - s)^2 = 36 + s²

Expanding left side:

q² - 2qs + s² = 36 + s² → q² - 2qs = 36 → q² - 2qs - 36 = 0.

That's equation (1).

Also, since S is the center, the distance from S to R must also equal SP. Let's verify:

SR^2 = (6 - 0)^2 + (0 - s)^2 = 36 + s², same as SP. So that checks out.

Now, we need more equations to solve for variables. Let me think.

We also know that the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees. Arc PQR is the arc from P to R passing through Q, which is 98 degrees. This corresponds to the central angle ∠PSR, which is equal to the measure of arc PR. Wait, no—if the arc goes through Q, then the central angle would correspond to the arc from P to R through Q. But depending on whether it's the minor or major arc. Since the total circumference is 360 degrees, if arc PQR is 98 degrees, then it's likely the minor arc unless specified otherwise.

Wait, but if arc PQR is 98 degrees, then the central angle over that arc would be 98 degrees. So, the central angle ∠PSR (angle at center S between points P and R) would be 98 degrees. Wait, but if that's the case, then the central angle PSR is 98 degrees. However, in our coordinate system, points P(-6,0), R(6,0), and center S(0,s). The central angle between P and R would depend on where S is located.

Wait, the central angle ∠PSR is the angle between SP and SR vectors. Let me compute that. Since S is at (0, s), vector SP is from S to P: (-6, 0) - (0, s) = (-6, -s). Vector SR is (6, 0) - (0, s) = (6, -s). The angle between vectors SP and SR can be found using the dot product.

Dot product of SP and SR vectors:

(-6)(6) + (-s)(-s) = -36 + s²

The magnitude of SP is sqrt( (-6)^2 + (-s)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + s² )

Same for SR. So, cos(theta) = (dot product)/(|SP| |SR|) = (-36 + s²)/(36 + s²)

But theta is the central angle ∠PSR, which corresponds to the arc PR. But earlier, we were told that arc PQR is 98 degrees. So, arc PR through Q is 98 degrees. Which would mean that the central angle ∠PSR is 98 degrees. Therefore:

cos(theta) = (s² - 36)/(s² + 36) = cos(98°)

So, solving for s:

(s² - 36)/(s² + 36) = cos(98°)

Let me compute cos(98°). Let me convert degrees to radians if needed, but maybe just keep it as cos(98°). Let me note that 98 degrees is in the second quadrant, so cosine will be negative.

But let's write down the equation:

(s² - 36)/(s² + 36) = cos(98°)

Let me call this Equation (2).

But without knowing the value of cos(98°), maybe we can find s² in terms of known quantities. However, this seems complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since we have the measure of arc PQR = 98°, which is the arc from P to R through Q. Therefore, the arc PQ + arc QR = 98°, as per the given. So, if we can find the measure of arc PQ, that's what we need.

But how do we connect this with the rest of the information?

Perhaps using power of a point or properties of chords.

Alternatively, since QT is perpendicular to PR at T, which is the midpoint. As we established, S lies on QT. So, in our coordinate system, S is along the y-axis. Also, since Q is on the circle, and S is the center, then SQ is a radius. So, SQ = SP = SR.

From earlier, we had the equation q² - 2qs - 36 = 0.

Also, the coordinates of Q are (0, q), and since Q is on the circle, the radius squared is SP² = 36 + s², which equals SQ² = (q - s)^2. Therefore, (q - s)^2 = 36 + s² ⇒ expanding gives q² - 2qs + s² = 36 + s² ⇒ q² - 2qs = 36 ⇒ q² = 2qs + 36.

So, q² = 2qs + 36.

Now, since S is on QT, which in coordinates is the y-axis, so S is (0, s). Also, the line QT goes from Q(0,q) to T(0,0), passing through S(0,s). So, S is somewhere between Q and T or extended beyond. Depending on where S is.

But how can we find s?

Alternatively, maybe we can find the relation between the arcs and the positions of points.

Alternatively, since arc PQ + arc QR = 98°, and we need arc PQ. If we can find arc QR, then subtract from 98° to get arc PQ. How?

If we can find the measure of arc QR, then we can find arc PQ. But how?

Alternatively, since QT is perpendicular to PR, and T is midpoint of PR, which implies that QT is the perpendicular bisector of PR, hence passing through the center S. Therefore, the line QS passes through the center S. So, the line QS is a line from Q through S to the opposite side of the circle.

Therefore, S lies on line QT. So, the center S is along QT, which in coordinates is the y-axis. So, S is at (0, s), and Q is at (0, q). Therefore, the center S is along the line connecting Q and T. Therefore, the distance from Q to S is |q - s|, and from S to T is |s - 0| = |s|. 

Moreover, since S is the center, the radius is the distance from S to P, which is sqrt(36 + s²). Also, the distance from S to Q is |q - s|, which must equal the radius. So:

|q - s| = sqrt(36 + s²)

Square both sides:

(q - s)^2 = 36 + s² ⇒ q² - 2qs + s² = 36 + s² ⇒ q² - 2qs = 36 ⇒ same as before.

But we still have two variables here: q and s. Need another equation.

But maybe we can relate this to the arc measures. Let me think.

The arc PQ is related to the central angle ∠PSQ. Similarly, arc QR relates to ∠QSR.

Wait, the measure of arc PQ is equal to the central angle ∠PSQ. Similarly, arc QR is equal to ∠QSR. 

But since points P, Q, R are on the circle, and S is the center, the central angles correspond to those arcs.

But how can we relate these angles to the coordinates?

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle SPQ or similar triangles.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of P, Q, R, and S, maybe we can express the angles in terms of coordinates.

For example, the central angle ∠PSQ is the angle between vectors SP and SQ. Let me compute that.

Vector SP is from S to P: P - S = (-6, 0) - (0, s) = (-6, -s)

Vector SQ is from S to Q: Q - S = (0, q) - (0, s) = (0, q - s)

The angle between vectors SP and SQ is the central angle for arc PQ. Let me denote this angle as θ, which is equal to measure of arc PQ. Similarly, the central angle for arc QR would be φ, and θ + φ = 98°.

To find θ, we can use the dot product:

cosθ = (SP · SQ) / (|SP| |SQ|)

Compute SP · SQ: (-6)(0) + (-s)(q - s) = 0 - s(q - s) = -sq + s²

|SP| = sqrt( (-6)^2 + (-s)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + s² )

|SQ| = sqrt( (0)^2 + (q - s)^2 ) = |q - s|

So,

cosθ = (-sq + s²) / (sqrt(36 + s²) * |q - s| )

But since |q - s| is the radius, which is sqrt(36 + s² ), so substituting:

cosθ = (s² - sq) / (sqrt(36 + s²) * sqrt(36 + s² )) ) = (s² - sq) / (36 + s² )

But from earlier, we had q² - 2qs = 36 ⇒ q² = 2qs + 36. So, perhaps we can express s² - sq in terms of q.

Alternatively, maybe we can find s in terms of q, or vice versa. From q² = 2qs + 36, rearranged:

q² - 2qs - 36 = 0 ⇒ quadratic in q: q² - 2s q - 36 = 0 ⇒ solutions q = [2s ± sqrt(4s² + 144)]/2 = s ± sqrt(s² + 36)

So, q = s + sqrt(s² + 36) or q = s - sqrt(s² + 36). Since Q is a point on the circle, and T is at (0,0), which is below the center S. Depending on where S is, q could be above or below. Assuming the circle extends upwards, maybe q is positive or negative. But let's not assume.

However, this may complicate things further. Let me think differently.

Earlier, we had from the central angle ∠PSR = 98°, which gave us:

(s² - 36)/(s² + 36) = cos(98°)

Let me compute cos(98°). Using calculator, cos(98°) ≈ cos(90° + 8°) = -sin(8°) ≈ -0.1392.

So approximately, cos(98°) ≈ -0.1392.

Thus:

(s² - 36)/(s² + 36) ≈ -0.1392

Multiply both sides by (s² + 36):

s² - 36 ≈ -0.1392(s² + 36)

Expand RHS: -0.1392s² - 0.1392*36 ≈ -0.1392s² - 5.0112

Bring all terms to LHS:

s² - 36 + 0.1392s² + 5.0112 ≈ 0

Combine like terms:

(1 + 0.1392)s² + (-36 + 5.0112) ≈ 0 ⇒ 1.1392s² - 30.9888 ≈ 0

Then:

s² ≈ 30.9888 / 1.1392 ≈ approx 27.23

So s² ≈ 27.23 ⇒ s ≈ sqrt(27.23) ≈ 5.22

But this is approximate. Let me carry this forward.

Now, with s² ≈ 27.23, let's go back to the expression for cosθ, where θ is the measure of arc PQ.

Earlier, we had:

cosθ = (s² - sq) / (s² + 36)

But we also have from q² = 2qs + 36.

Let me try to express q in terms of s. From q² - 2qs - 36 = 0, we can solve for q:

q = [2s ± sqrt{(2s)^2 + 144}]/2 = [2s ± sqrt{4s² + 144}]/2 = s ± sqrt{s² + 36}

Assuming that Q is above T, which is at (0,0), and S is somewhere along the y-axis. If s is positive (center above T), then q could be greater than s or less than s. Suppose S is above T, so s > 0. If Q is on the circle, then depending on where it is, q could be higher or lower. But since QT is perpendicular to PR and passes through the center, which is S. So, if S is between Q and T, then q > s, or if S is beyond T, then q < s.

But let's take q = s + sqrt(s² + 36). Wait, that would make q larger than s. Or q = s - sqrt(s² + 36), which would be negative, since sqrt(s² + 36) > s. So, if q = s - sqrt(...), then q would be negative. Let me check with approximate numbers.

Take s ≈ 5.22, then sqrt(s² + 36) ≈ sqrt(27.23 + 36) = sqrt(63.23) ≈ 7.95. So, if q = s - 7.95 ≈ 5.22 - 7.95 ≈ -2.73. Alternatively, q = s + 7.95 ≈ 5.22 + 7.95 ≈ 13.17.

So, possible values for q are around -2.73 or 13.17. Let's consider both possibilities.

Case 1: q = s - sqrt(s² + 36) ≈ -2.73. Then, plug into cosθ = (s² - sq)/(s² + 36).

Let me compute numerator: s² - sq = s² - s*q = s² - s*(s - sqrt(s² + 36)) = s² - s² + s*sqrt(s² + 36) = s*sqrt(s² + 36)

Denominator is s² + 36.

So cosθ = [s*sqrt(s² + 36)] / (s² + 36) = s / sqrt(s² + 36)

Which simplifies to cosθ = s / sqrt(s² + 36)

But s ≈ 5.22, so sqrt(s² + 36) ≈ sqrt(27.23 + 36) ≈ sqrt(63.23) ≈ 7.95. So cosθ ≈ 5.22 / 7.95 ≈ 0.656. So θ ≈ arccos(0.656) ≈ 49 degrees. Hmm, that's interesting. 49 degrees is one of the answer choices (option B). 

Alternatively, Case 2: q = s + sqrt(s² + 36) ≈ 5.22 + 7.95 ≈ 13.17. Then, compute numerator: s² - sq = s² - s*q = s² - s*(s + sqrt(s² + 36)) = s² - s² - s*sqrt(...) = -s*sqrt(...). So cosθ = -s*sqrt(s² + 36) / (s² + 36) = -s / sqrt(s² + 36) ≈ -5.22 / 7.95 ≈ -0.656. Then θ ≈ arccos(-0.656) ≈ 130 degrees. But this would mean arc PQ is 130 degrees, which is not among the answer choices, and since the total arc PQR is 98 degrees, adding arc PQ (130) and arc QR would exceed 98, which is impossible. Therefore, this case is invalid. Hence, Case 1 is the valid one, giving θ ≈ 49 degrees. 

So, this suggests that arc PQ is approximately 49 degrees, which matches option B. 

But let me verify this algebraically instead of numerically. Let me see:

From earlier, we have:

cosθ = s / sqrt(s² + 36)

But from the previous equation relating to the central angle ∠PSR = 98 degrees:

(s² - 36)/(s² + 36) = cos(98°)

Let me denote x = s². Then:

(x - 36)/(x + 36) = cos(98°)

Let me solve for x:

x - 36 = cos(98°)*(x + 36)

x - 36 = cos(98°)*x + 36*cos(98°)

Bring terms with x to left:

x - cos(98°)*x = 36 + 36*cos(98°)

x[1 - cos(98°)] = 36[1 + cos(98°)]

Therefore,

x = [36(1 + cos(98°))] / [1 - cos(98°)]

This gives us s² = x = [36(1 + cos(98°))]/[1 - cos(98°)]

Now, recall that cosθ = s / sqrt(s² + 36). Let me square both sides:

cos²θ = s²/(s² + 36) = [x]/[x + 36]

Substituting x:

cos²θ = [36(1 + cos(98°))/ (1 - cos(98°)) ] / [36(1 + cos(98°))/(1 - cos(98°)) + 36 ]

Factor 36 in denominator:

Denominator becomes 36[ (1 + cos(98°))/(1 - cos(98°)) + 1 ] = 36[ (1 + cos(98°) + 1 - cos(98°)) / (1 - cos(98°)) ) ] = 36[ 2 / (1 - cos(98°)) ]

So, cos²θ = [36(1 + cos(98°))/ (1 - cos(98°)) ] / [36 * 2 / (1 - cos(98°)) ) ] = [ (1 + cos(98°)) / 2 ]

Thus, cos²θ = [1 + cos(98°)] / 2

Using the identity cos(α) = 2cos²(α/2) - 1, rearranged:

cos²(α/2) = [1 + cosα]/2

So, [1 + cos(98°)] / 2 = cos²(49°), since α = 98°, so α/2 = 49°. Therefore:

cos²θ = cos²(49°) ⇒ cosθ = ±cos(49°)

But θ is the measure of arc PQ, which is between 0 and 180 degrees (since it's an arc of a circle). Given that the arc PQR is 98 degrees, which is the sum of arc PQ and arc QR. Since arc PQ is part of that 98-degree arc, it must be less than 98 degrees. So θ is between 0 and 98 degrees. Therefore, cosθ is positive (as θ is acute). Hence, cosθ = cos(49°) ⇒ θ = 49°.

Therefore, the measure of arc PQ is 49 degrees, which is option B.

Wow! So regardless of the specific value of s, the measure of arc PQ comes out to be 49 degrees. This makes sense, because we used the identity related to the double-angle formula. So even though we didn't know the exact value of s, the trigonometric identities led us directly to θ = 49 degrees.

Hence, the correct answer is B.
