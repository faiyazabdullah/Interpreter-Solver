MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given here. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, it says that Triangle(A,B,C) is a right triangle. Also, Angle(A,B,C) is a right angle. Wait, no—wait, the RightAngle is specified as Angle(A,C,B). Let me parse that again. The RightAngle is at point C? Because Angle(A,C,B) would mean the angle at point C between points A and B. Wait, angles are usually denoted with the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(A,C,B) is the angle at point C between points A and B. So that means the right angle is at point C. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. That makes sense because then sides AC and BC would be the legs, and AB the hypotenuse.

Wait, but then they mention IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)). So line AB is the hypotenuse. Which matches with the right angle at C. So that checks out.

Now, the lengths: LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 16, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 10. So side AC is 16 units, side BC is 10 units. Since it's a right triangle at C, those two sides are the legs. Then AB is the hypotenuse. 

The question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle at point B, right? Wait, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, since the middle letter is B. Wait, no. Wait, angle notation: Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. Wait, but earlier we had that the right angle is at C (from Angle(A,C,B)), so that's the right angle. Therefore, angle at B is not the right angle. So we need to find the measure of angle at B, which is opposite to side AC (since in triangle ABC, side opposite angle B is AC). Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Let me sketch the triangle mentally. Points A, B, C. Right angle at C. So sides AC and BC are perpendicular. Then AB is hypotenuse. Now, angle at B is angle ABC. So we need to find the measure of angle at B.

But how do we compute that?

Given that the triangle has legs AC = 16 and BC = 10, so we can use trigonometry. In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent.

So, for angle at B, the sides relative to that angle: the opposite side is AC (which is 16), and the adjacent side is BC (which is 10). Wait, no. Wait, angle at B: the sides forming angle B are BA and BC. The opposite side to angle B is AC. So tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. Wait, but AC is opposite to angle B. Wait, let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So:

- Side AC is adjacent to angle B? Or wait, let's think about the sides.

At angle B, the two sides are BC (adjacent) and BA (hypotenuse). But the opposite side to angle B is AC. So yes, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. So tan(x) = 16/10 = 8/5. So tan(x) = 1.6. Then x is arctangent of 1.6.

Alternatively, maybe I got the ratio reversed. Let me check again.

If angle at B, then the sides:

Opposite side is AC, length 16.

Adjacent side is BC, length 10.

Therefore, tan(angle B) = AC / BC = 16 / 10 = 1.6. So x = arctan(1.6).

Now, the answer choices are numerical values. Let me calculate arctan(1.6). Let me recall that tan(58 degrees) is approximately 1.6, because tan(60 degrees) is √3 ≈ 1.732, tan(45) is 1. So 1.6 is between 45 and 60 degrees. Let me check exact value.

Using calculator input: arctan(1.6). Let me approximate. For example, tan(58°): Let me remember some standard values. Alternatively, perhaps using known ratios.

Alternatively, since tan(theta) = 16/10 = 8/5 = 1.6. So theta = arctan(8/5). Let me see if there's a way to relate this to the answer choices. The options are A.21, B.34, C.58, D.67.

So 58 degrees is option C. Let me check if tan(58°) is roughly 1.6. Let me think. Let me recall that tan(58°):

I know that tan(50°) ≈ 1.191, tan(55°) ≈ 1.428, tan(60°)=1.732. So 1.6 is between 55° and 60°. Let me try 58°.

Looking up tan(58°): Using a calculator (pretending I'm calculating), tan(58) is approximately 1.6003... So that's very close to 1.6. Therefore, arctan(1.6) is approximately 58 degrees. Hence, the answer is C. 58 degrees.

Wait, but let me verify once more. If the triangle has legs 10 and 16, then the hypotenuse is sqrt(10² +16²) = sqrt(100+256)=sqrt(356)=approx 18.87. Then, angle at B: opposite side is 16, adjacent is 10. So tan(theta)=16/10=1.6. As above. So theta≈58 degrees. So answer is C.

But just to make sure, let me check another approach. Maybe using sine or cosine.

For angle B, sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse = 16 / sqrt(10^2 + 16^2) = 16/sqrt(356). Let me compute that. sqrt(356) is approx 18.87. So 16/18.87 ≈ 0.85. What's arcsin(0.85)? Let me recall that sin(58°) is approx 0.848, which is very close to 0.85. So angle is approx 58 degrees. Therefore, confirming that the answer is C. 58 degrees.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure $ x $ of angle $ \angle ABC $ in triangle $ \triangle ABC $, we begin by analyzing the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told:

- Triangle $ ABC $ is **right-angled** at point $ C $, i.e., $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $.
- Sides:
  - $ AC = 16 $
  - $ BC = 10 $
- Hypotenuse is $ AB $, meaning the right angle lies at $ C $.
- We are to find the measure of $ \angle ABC $, which is denoted as $ x $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Trigonometric Ratios**

Since $ \triangle ABC $ is a right triangle with the right angle at $ C $, the angle $ x = \angle ABC $ lies at vertex $ B $. To find its measure, consider the triangle’s sides relative to angle $ B $:

- **Opposite** side to angle $ B $: $ AC = 16 $
- **Adjacent** side to angle $ B $: $ BC = 10 $

Thus,

$$
\tan(x) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{16}{10} = 1.6
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Angle**

We now evaluate:

$$
x = \arctan(1.6)
$$

Using a scientific calculator or reference table:

$$
\arctan(1.6) \approx 58^\circ
$$

This corresponds closely to the given answer choice **C**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of angle $ x $ is approximately $ 58^\circ $, matching answer choice **C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
