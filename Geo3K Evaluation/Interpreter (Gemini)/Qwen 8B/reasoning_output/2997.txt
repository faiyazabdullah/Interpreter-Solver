MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, first, I need to visualize the given information based on the constraints provided. Let me start by listing out all the given points and their relationships.

We have a circle B. Points F, G, H, J lie on this circle because each of them has the PointLiesOnCircle constraint with Circle(B). That means all these four points are on the circumference of circle B. 

Then there are several lines mentioned: Line(F,G), Line(H,J), Line(H,B), Line(J,B). Also, it's stated that Line(F,G) is congruent to Line(H,J), so they must be equal in length. Since both lines are chords of the circle (because their endpoints are on the circle), their lengths being equal implies something about their arcs. Also, the arcs Arc(F,G) and Arc(H,J) are congruent, which makes sense since congruent chords correspond to congruent arcs in a circle.

Next, Triangle(H,B,J) is formed by connecting points H, B, and J. The problem states that IsRadiusOf(Line(H,B),Circle(B)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(J,B),Circle(B)). Wait, but Line(H,B) and Line(J,B) are radii? Because if you connect point H (on the circle) to center B, then HB would be a radius. Similarly for JB. Therefore, triangle HBJ has two sides that are radii of the circle, making it an isosceles triangle. The problem also confirms that it's isosceles, as per Isosceles(Triangle(H,B,J)).

Additionally, the measure of angle at point B, Angle(H,B,J), is given as 140 degrees. Wait, angle at vertex B between points H and J. So angle HBJ is 140 degrees. But since HB and JB are radii, triangle HBJ is isosceles with HB = JB. In such a triangle, the base angles at H and J should be equal. However, the given angle is at B, which is the vertex angle.

Wait, in an isosceles triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If the vertex angle is 140 degrees, then the two base angles would be (180 - 140)/2 = 20 degrees each. But wait, the question asks for x, which I assume refers to some angle here. But let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "Angle(H,B,J)" which is the angle at point B between points H and J, so that's angle HBJ. And that measure is given as 140 degrees. Then the question is asking to find x. But where is x defined? Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Looking back at the problem statement. The user mentions "Find x." But the problem didn't explicitly define what x is. Wait, perhaps there's a missing part? Or maybe x refers to another angle in the diagram. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the original problem might have had a diagram with labeled angles, but since it's text-only, maybe x is referring to another angle. Alternatively, perhaps x is the measure of another angle related to the arcs or the triangle. For example, maybe the inscribed angles subtended by the arcs FG and HJ?

Alternatively, considering the arcs FG and HJ are congruent, since their chords are congruent. Each arc corresponds to central angles equal to the measure of the arc. Since the chord FG is congruent to chord HJ, their corresponding arcs are congruent. So the central angles over those arcs would be equal.

But how does that relate to angle HBJ? Let me think. Since angle HBJ is a central angle for arc HJ, right? Because B is the center of the circle. Wait, yes! Because line HB and JB are radii, so the angle at B between H and J is a central angle intercepting arc HJ. Therefore, the measure of angle HBJ is equal to the measure of arc HJ. Given that angle HBJ is 140 degrees, so arc HJ measures 140 degrees. Since arcs FG and HJ are congruent, arc FG also measures 140 degrees.

Now, looking at the other parts. There's a line FG, which is a chord of the circle. The arc FG is congruent to arc HJ, so each is 140 degrees. Now, what else can we infer?

Let me consider the triangle HBJ. We know it's an isosceles triangle with two sides as radii, and angle at B is 140 degrees. So the other two angles at H and J are each (180-140)/2=20 degrees. So angles at H and J are 20 degrees each.

But how does that help us find x? Unless x refers to one of these angles. However, the answer choices are 30, 35, 70, 140. Wait, 20 isn't among the choices. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps x refers to an inscribed angle subtended by arc FG or HJ. Since arc FG is 140 degrees, an inscribed angle subtending that arc would be half of 140, which is 70 degrees. Similarly for arc HJ. So maybe x is 70 degrees?

Wait, but why would x be an inscribed angle? Let me see. Are there any inscribed angles mentioned? The problem mentions Angle(H,B,J), which is a central angle. But maybe there's another angle somewhere else.

Wait, considering points F and G are on the circle, and FG is a chord. The arc FG is 140 degrees. An inscribed angle subtended by arc FG would be half of that, so 70 degrees. If there's an angle formed by points F, G, and another point on the circle, like maybe point H or J?

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle involved. Let me think again.

The problem also includes lines FG and HJ as chords. Since arc FG is congruent to arc HJ, both are 140 degrees. Now, suppose there's an angle formed by intersecting chords or something else. For instance, if there's a quadrilateral or another triangle involving these points.

Alternatively, maybe there's an angle formed at point F or G, or another intersection point. Wait, but without more info, perhaps the key lies in the fact that angle HBJ is 140 degrees, which is the central angle for arc HJ. Then, the inscribed angle subtending arc HJ would be 70 degrees. So if x is that inscribed angle, then the answer would be 70 degrees, option C.

But where is that angle located? Suppose there's a point on the circle forming an inscribed angle over arc HJ. For example, if there's a point K on the circle such that angle HKJ is an inscribed angle over arc HJ. But unless specified, it's unclear. However, given the answer choices, 70 seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the angle between chords FH or something else. Let me think again.

Another approach: Since the central angle for arc HJ is 140 degrees, then the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc would be half, 70 degrees. So if x is such an inscribed angle, then x is 70. Hence, answer C.

Alternatively, if there's an angle formed by the intersection of chords FG and HJ. But unless there's more information, this is speculative.

Wait, the problem also mentions arcs FG and HJ are congruent. So arc FG is 140 degrees. Suppose we look at triangle FBG. Since F and G are points on the circle, BF and BG are radii. Therefore, triangle FBG is isosceles with BF=BG. The central angle for arc FG is 140 degrees, so angle FBG is 140 degrees. Then the base angles at F and G would be (180-140)/2 = 20 degrees each.

But again, unless x is one of these angles, which are 20 degrees, not matching the options. So perhaps x is referring to an angle formed elsewhere.

Wait, going back to triangle HBJ. If that triangle has angles at H and J of 20 degrees each, then maybe there's another triangle involving those angles. For instance, if lines FH and GJ intersect or form some angles. But without specific information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe considering that points F, G, H, J are arranged around the circle, creating some cyclic quadrilateral or something. But again, without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky.

Wait, but the problem gives multiple chords FG and HJ, which are congruent. Also, lines HB and JB are radii. So, considering that, maybe there's an angle formed at point B between different chords. Wait, but angle at B is already given as 140 degrees.

Alternatively, could there be an external angle or something else? Let me think differently.

If arc FG is 140 degrees, then the inscribed angle subtended by arc FG would be 70 degrees. Suppose there's an angle formed by points F, G, and another point on the circle. For example, if there's a point L on the circle such that angle FLG is an inscribed angle over arc FG, then that angle would be 70 degrees. If x is that angle, then answer C.

Since 70 is one of the options, and given that the central angle is 140, which leads to an inscribed angle of 70, that seems likely. Hence, the answer is C. 70 degrees.

So, Final Answer: C.
