====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral ABCD with some specific constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information and then see how they relate to each other.

First, the quadrilateral has points A, B, C, D connected as lines AB, BC, CD, DA. The angles at each vertex are mentioned: Angle(A), Angle(B), Angle(C), Angle(D). We know that Angle(B) and Angle(C) are right angles (90 degrees each) because they're marked as RightAngle. Also, there are perpendicularity conditions between certain sides: Line AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is perpendicular to CD. Additionally, it says that Line AB is parallel to Line DC. 

Wait, so if AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is perpendicular to CD, that suggests that AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC. Since AB is parallel to DC, that would mean AB and DC are both perpendicular to BC, which makes them parallel to each other. That seems consistent because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they must be parallel. So that checks out.

Now, looking at the angles. The measure of angle A is three times x, angle D is x, and angles B and C are 90 degrees each. The sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral should be 360 degrees. So adding up all the angles:

Measure(A) + Measure(B) + Measure(C) + Measure(D) = 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 4x + 180. And this equals 360 degrees. So solving for x:

4x + 180 = 360  
Subtract 180: 4x = 180  
Divide by 4: x = 45 degrees.

So angle A is 3x = 135 degrees, angle D is x = 45 degrees. But wait, the question asks for angle C. Wait, but angle C is already given as a right angle, which is 90 degrees. However, let me check again. The problem states that Angle(C) is a right angle, so that's fixed. But maybe I need to confirm if there's something else?

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says "Find ∠C of quadrilateral ABCD." But according to the given constraints, Angle(C) is a right angle, so that should be 90 degrees. But why is there an option B as 90? Maybe there's a trick here. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it. Let me think about the structure of the quadrilateral. If AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is perpendicular to CD, then AB is parallel to CD. So the quadrilateral is a rectangle? No, because only two angles are right angles. Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Here, angles B and C are right angles, but angles A and D might not be. However, since AB is parallel to CD, and AD connects back to complete the quadrilateral. Hmm.

But according to the angle measures, angles A and D add up to 3x + x = 4x, which equals 180 degrees, since total sum is 360. Wait, earlier calculation said 4x + 180 = 360, leading to x=45. Then angles A is 135, D is 45, B and C are 90 each. So total angles: 135+90+90+45 = 360. Correct.

Therefore, angle C is 90 degrees. So the answer should be B. But let me check again if there's something wrong here. For example, could there be a mistake in assuming that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360? Well, yes, that's a standard formula. Each time you split a quadrilateral into triangles, you get two triangles, so 180*2=360. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that AB is parallel to CD implies something else? Like, making it a trapezoid. In a trapezoid with AB || CD, and angles at B and C being right angles. So imagine AB and CD are the two bases, vertical. Then BC is a vertical side connecting them. Wait, no—if AB is perpendicular to BC, then BC is vertical if AB is horizontal. Similarly, BC is perpendicular to CD, meaning CD is horizontal. So AB and CD are both horizontal, hence parallel. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a right trapezoid with two right angles at B and C. Then angles at A and D are supplementary? Because in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Wait, but in this case, since AB is parallel to CD, then angles at A and D are on the base AD. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: Points A and B are connected by AB, which is horizontal. Then BC is vertical upwards from B, forming a right angle. Then CD goes horizontally to the left (since BC is vertical and CD is perpendicular to BC, so CD is horizontal opposite direction of AB). Then DA connects back to A. So DA would be slanting. So angle at A is between DA and AB. Since AB is horizontal, DA is going from D to A. Depending on the lengths, angle A can be obtuse or acute. Similarly, angle D is between CD and DA.

In such a trapezoid, angles at A and D would depend on the lengths of the sides. However, according to our previous calculation, angle A is 135°, angle D is 45°, which adds up to 180°, which makes sense because they are adjacent angles on the same leg (AD). Wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Since AB || CD, angles at A and D are on the legs AD. So angle A + angle D = 180°, which matches our calculation (135 + 45 = 180). So that's consistent.

Thus, angle C is still 90°, as given. Therefore, the answer should be B. But let me check again if there's a possibility that angle C isn't 90°. Wait, the problem explicitly says that Angle(C) is a right angle. So regardless of anything else, angle C is 90 degrees. Hence, answer is B.

Wait, but the problem gives answer choices including B as 90. So unless there's a miscalculation here. Let me recheck the equations:

Total angles: A + B + C + D = 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 4x + 180 = 360 → 4x = 180 → x = 45. So angle C is 90. So answer is B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem involves a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with specific geometric constraints. Given that $\angle B$ and $\angle C$ are right angles ($90^\circ$), and the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always $360^\circ$, we can derive the value of $\angle C$. 

Key steps:
1. **Sum of Angles**: 
   $$
   \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
   $$
   Substituting known values:
   $$
   3x + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x = 360^\circ
   $$
   Simplifying:
   $$
   4x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ \implies 4x = 180^\circ \implies x = 45^\circ
   $$

2. **Specific Angles**:
   - $\angle A = 3x = 135^\circ$
   - $\angle D = x = 45^\circ$
   - $\angle B = \angle C = 90^\circ$

3. **Conclusion**:
   $\angle C$ is explicitly defined as a right angle by the problem's constraints, confirming its measure is $90^\circ$.

Final Answer: B
