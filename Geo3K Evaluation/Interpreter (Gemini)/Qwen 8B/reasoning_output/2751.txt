Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the points relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints and then see what we can deduce from them.

We have several points: D, W, X, Y, Z, C, G, H, I, J. Then there are lines connecting some of these points. For example, Line(D,C) means points D and C are connected by a line. Similarly, Line(G,Y). Also, there are conditions that certain points lie on these lines. So, Point W lies on Line(D,C), as does X, Y, Z. That suggests that Points W, X, Y, Z are colinear along Line DC. Wait, but Line(G,Y) has points H and I lying on it. So maybe there are multiple lines here?

Let me sketch mentally. Let me note down:

- Line DC: Points W, X, Y, Z lie on it. So they are collinear on DC. Therefore, the order might be important. But since they are just labeled W, X, Y, Z, perhaps their positions along DC aren't specified yet.

Then Line(GY): Points H and I lie on it. So G and Y are endpoints of this line? Or maybe G is another point? Wait, Line(G,Y) would mean points G and Y are connected by a line, and H and I lie on that line. So Line GY has points H and I somewhere on it.

Also, angles mentioned: Angle(WXJ) measures 130 degrees. So angle at point X between points W and J. And angle(YZG) measures 20 degrees. So angle at point Z between points Y and G.

Additionally, there's a ratio condition: RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(IJ)), LengthOf(Line(XJ)), LengthOf(Line(HJ)), LengthOf(Line(YJ))) equals the division of (IJ / XJ) equals (HJ / YJ). So the proportion is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Which implies that triangles may be similar or something related to similar triangles.

Moreover, Triangle(H,I,J) is given. So triangle HIJ exists.

The question asks for the measure of angle YIZ. So angle at point I between points Y and Z.

First, let me try to visualize or reconstruct the diagram based on the given points and lines.

Starting with Line DC, which contains points W, X, Y, Z. Let me assume that they are in order along DC. But without knowing exact positions, maybe I need to consider relative positions.

But also, there's Line GY, which includes points H and I. Since Y is on Line DC (from earlier), so Y is a point on both DC and GY. Therefore, Line GY connects points G and Y, with H and I on it. So G is another point not on DC, and Y is the intersection point of DC and GY.

So points W, X, Y, Z are on DC; points H and I are on GY. Also, there's a triangle HIJ. So J is another point, connected to I and H. Also, angle WXJ is 130°, and angle YZG is 20°. The ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

Hmm. Maybe using similar triangles here? Because the ratio suggests that perhaps two triangles are similar, leading to equal angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles.

First, let me think about the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This looks like the definition of similar triangles if those sides are corresponding sides. However, the way it's written, it's comparing ratios of lengths. Let me rephrase the equation:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → cross multiplying gives IJ * YJ = HJ * XJ.

But maybe there's a better approach. If we consider triangles involving these segments. For instance, if there's a triangle where sides correspond to these lengths.

Wait, considering triangle IJX and triangle HJY? Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe triangle IJX and triangle YJH? Wait, but the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. So if two sides are proportional, and maybe included angles are equal, then triangles could be similar.

Alternatively, since J is involved in both ratios, perhaps there's a transversal or something else.

But first, let me check if points J is connected to others. From the problem statement, there's an angle WXJ, which involves point J. So J is connected to W and X? Or is J connected to X and another point? Wait, angle WXJ is at point X, with segments XW and XJ. Wait no: angle at X between W and J. Wait, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So angle WXJ is the angle at point X between points W, X, J. So vertex at X, with segments XW and XJ. So that would imply that J is connected to X. Similarly, angle YIZ is the angle at I between Y and Z. So J is connected to I? Or maybe not directly. Hmm.

Also, triangle H, I, J is given. So points H, I, J form a triangle. So J is connected to H and I.

Given that, perhaps there's a relationship between triangles involving J and the other points.

Now, given the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me denote that as:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ ⇒ IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ.

This suggests that triangles IJX and HJY might be similar? If the sides around the angle are proportional.

Wait, suppose we have two triangles: triangle IJX and triangle HJY. If the ratio of sides IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ, and if the included angles are equal, then the triangles would be similar.

But what's the included angle? Let's think. In triangle IJX, the sides adjacent to angle at J would be IJ and XJ. Whereas in triangle HJY, the sides adjacent to angle at J would be HJ and YJ. But unless those angles are equal, similarity isn't guaranteed.

Alternatively, maybe there's another pair of triangles. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, maybe there's a concept of parallel lines or similar triangles where these ratios come into play.

Another thought: since points W, X, Y, Z are colinear on DC, and points H, I are on GY, which passes through Y. So Y is a common point between DC and GY.

Let me try to imagine coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to some points to model the situation.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to make calculations easier.

Let me take Line DC as the x-axis. Let me assume that points W, X, Y, Z lie on the x-axis. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s say point D is at (0,0), and point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0. Then points W, X, Y, Z lie on the x-axis. Let me assume their order is W, X, Y, Z along the line. Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(D,C)), same for X, Y, Z. So they are all on DC, but their order isn't specified. However, angle WXJ is mentioned, which requires that W and X are distinct points. Similarly, angle YZG involves Y and Z. So likely, the order is such that moving along DC, you encounter W, then X, then Y, then Z? Or some permutation. But since angle YZG is mentioned, which is at point Z between Y and G. So Y and Z are connected via line segment YZ, and G is another point connected to Y. Since G is part of line GY, which contains points H and I. So G is another point not on DC.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates:

Let me fix coordinates for simplicity. Let me place point Y at origin (0,0) for ease. Wait, but maybe that complicates things because Line DC includes Y. Alternatively, let me take DC as x-axis, with Y at some position. Let me try:

Let me define Line DC as the x-axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let me set point Y at (0,0). Since Y is on DC, which is the x-axis. Then, points W, X, Z are also on the x-axis. Suppose the order is W --- X --- Y --- Z along the x-axis. Wait, but angle YZG is mentioned, which is at point Z between Y and G. So Y is connected to Z, and Z is connected to G. So line YZ is part of DC (since Z is on DC), so line YZ is along DC. Therefore, point G is connected to Y, forming line GY, which includes points H and I.

So, assuming DC is x-axis, Y is at (0,0). Let me assume Z is at some positive x-coordinate, say z. Then YZ is along x-axis from Y(0,0) to Z(z, 0). Then, angle YZG is at point Z between Y and G. So G is a point not on the x-axis, connected to Y. So line GY goes from Y(0,0) to G(some point), passing through H and I.

Similarly, angle WXJ is at point X between W and J. So point X is on DC (x-axis), and J is some point connected to X, forming angle with W.

Also, there's a triangle HIJ. So points H, I, J form a triangle. Given that H and I are on line GY, which passes through Y(0,0).

Now, the key ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me think about how to use this.

Since H and I are on line GY, which connects Y(0,0) to G. Let me parametrize line GY. Let me assume coordinates for G. Let me pick coordinates for G as (a, b), so that line GY goes from Y(0,0) to G(a,b). Then points H and I lie on this line. Let me parameterize this line. Any point on line GY can be expressed as t*(a, b), where t is a real number. So H and I would be at different values of t.

But without loss of generality, maybe I can set specific coordinates to simplify calculations. For example, let me assume that line GY is vertical or horizontal? No, since it's arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe assign coordinates such that line GY is y-axis? Wait, but Y is already on x-axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me assign coordinates as follows:

Set Y at (0,0), as before. Let me take line DC as x-axis, so Y is (0,0). Let me assume that point Z is at (z, 0), so that YZ is along x-axis from (0,0) to (z, 0). Then angle YZG is at Z between Y and G. So vector ZY is from Z to Y, which is (-z, 0), and vector ZG is from Z to G. The measure of angle YZG is 20 degrees.

So, the angle between vectors ZY and ZG is 20 degrees. So if I can express coordinates of G accordingly.

Let me suppose that Z is at (z, 0). Then vector ZY is (-z, 0). Vector ZG is (Gx - z, Gy - 0) = (Gx - z, Gy). The angle between ZY and ZG is 20 degrees. Using dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (ZY · ZG) / (|ZY| |ZG|)

So cos(20°) = [(-z)(Gx - z) + 0*(Gy)] / [ |ZY| * |ZG| ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -z(Gx - z) ] / [ z * sqrt((Gx - z)^2 + (Gy)^2) ) ] = [ - (Gx - z) ] / sqrt( (Gx - z)^2 + (Gy)^2 )

Therefore,

cos(20°) = [ - (Gx - z) ] / sqrt( (Gx - z)^2 + (Gy)^2 )

Let me denote dx = Gx - z, dy = Gy.

Then cos(20°) = -dx / sqrt(dx² + dy² )

Which implies that the direction of vector ZG makes an angle of 180° - 20° = 160° from the positive x-axis? Wait, because the cosine is negative, indicating that the angle is obtuse. Wait, the angle between ZY (which is pointing towards negative x-direction from Z) and ZG is 20 degrees. So depending on where G is located, this could be above or below the x-axis. Let me assume G is above the x-axis for simplicity.

Thus, the vector ZG would be making an angle of 20 degrees above the line ZY (which is towards the left). So if ZY is pointing to the left (negative x-direction), then ZG is making 20 degrees upward from ZY. Therefore, the direction of ZG is 20 degrees above the negative x-axis, which corresponds to an angle of 180° - 20° = 160° from the positive x-axis.

Therefore, the slope of ZG is tan(160°). Let me compute tan(160°). Since tan(160°) = tan(180° - 20°) = -tan(20°). So the slope of line ZG is -tan(20°). Thus, the line ZG has slope m = -tan(20°).

Therefore, coordinates of G can be determined if we know its distance from Z. But maybe I don't need exact coordinates, but rather relations.

However, this seems getting complicated. Let me think if there's another approach.

Back to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me think about triangles involving these segments. If I can find two triangles where these sides are proportional, and maybe there's an angle equality, then similarity could help.

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangles involving these segments.

For example, consider triangle IJX and triangle HJY. If IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if the included angles are equal, then triangles are similar.

What's the included angle? Let's see. In triangle IJX, the sides are IJ and XJ, meeting at J. In triangle HJY, the sides are HJ and YJ, meeting at J. Wait, but unless the angles at J are equal, the triangles wouldn't necessarily be similar.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangles formed with J. For example, if there's a line through J that creates similar triangles.

Alternatively, think about the given angles: angle WXJ is 130°, and angle YZG is 20°. Maybe there's a connection between these angles and the desired angle YIZ.

Let me recall that angle WXJ is at point X, between W and J. Since W and X are on DC (the x-axis in my previous setup), and J is some point not on DC. So angle WXJ being 130° suggests that J is positioned such that when you connect X to J, the angle between XW (along DC) and XJ is 130°. So that would place J somewhere off the line DC, creating that angle.

Similarly, angle YZG is 20°, which is at point Z between Y and G. As discussed earlier, this relates to the direction of line ZG.

Now, the main goal is to find angle YIZ, which is at point I between Y and Z. So point I is on line GY (as per the constraint PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(G,Y))). So I is somewhere along line GY. Therefore, angle YIZ is formed at point I between points Y and Z.

To find this angle, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle YIZ, or relate it to other triangles.

But first, let's try to find relationships using the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

Let me think of this ratio as implying that J lies on some particular locus. For example, if we consider the ratio of distances from J to X and J to I, etc. But not sure.

Alternatively, since H and I are on line GY, and J is connected to I and H (since triangle HIJ exists), maybe there's a relation between J and line GY.

Wait, if IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, then rearranging, we get IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ. This resembles the condition for J being on the Apollonius circle defined by points X and Y with respect to ratio XJ/YJ. However, since H and I are on line GY, maybe J is constructed such that it satisfies this ratio.

Alternatively, since H and I are on GY, and we're dealing with ratios involving HJ and YJ, maybe there's a way to express J in terms of H and I.

Alternatively, think about mass point geometry or coordinate geometry.

Maybe going back to coordinate system. Let me try to assign coordinates more concretely.

Let me assume coordinates:

Let me set Y at (0,0) as before, and Z at (1, 0) for simplicity. Then, since angle YZG is 20°, as before, the line ZG makes 20° with ZY (which is pointing to the left from Z). So vector ZY is (-1, 0), and vector ZG forms 20° with it. Assuming G is above the x-axis, the direction of ZG is 20° above the negative x-axis, so the slope is tan(160°) as before, which is -tan(20°). So the coordinates of G can be taken as (1 + d*cos(160°), d*sin(160°)) for some d > 0. But maybe choosing specific values to simplify.

Let me choose G such that line ZG has length 1 for simplicity. Let me set G at (cos(160°), sin(160°)). Wait, but Z is at (1,0), so the vector from Z to G should have magnitude 1. So coordinates of G would be Z plus vector of length 1 in direction 160° from Z. Wait, the direction from Z to G is 160° from positive x-axis? Wait earlier calculation said that the direction is 160°, yes.

Wait, if Z is at (1,0), then the direction of ZG is 160° from positive x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of G would be:

G_x = Z_x + cos(160°)*length, 
G_y = Z_y + sin(160°)*length.

Assuming length is 1, then:

G_x = 1 + cos(160°),
G_y = 0 + sin(160°).

Compute cos(160°) ≈ cos(180°−20°) = -cos(20°) ≈ -0.9397,
sin(160°) = sin(20°) ≈ 0.3420.

So G ≈ (1 - 0.9397, 0.3420) ≈ (0.0603, 0.3420).

So coordinates:

Z = (1, 0),
G ≈ (0.0603, 0.3420).

Now, points H and I lie on line GY. Since Y is at (0,0), and G is approximately (0.0603, 0.3420), line GY goes from Y(0,0) to G(0.0603, 0.3420). Parametric equations for line GY can be written as:

x = 0 + t*(0.0603 - 0) = 0.0603t,
y = 0 + t*(0.3420 - 0) = 0.3420t,

where t ranges from 0 to 1 for the segment YG, but extended beyond for points H and I.

Now, points H and I are on this line. Let me assume that H is closer to Y and I is further away, or vice versa. Let me assign parameters t_H and t_I for points H and I.

Let me choose specific values for t_H and t_I for simplicity. Let me say that H is at t=1/2 and I is at t=1. So:

For H at t=1/2:

H_x = 0.0603*(1/2) ≈ 0.03015,
H_y = 0.3420*(1/2) ≈ 0.1710.

For I at t=1:

I_x = 0.0603*1 ≈ 0.0603,
I_y = 0.3420*1 ≈ 0.3420.

So H ≈ (0.03015, 0.1710), I ≈ (0.0603, 0.3420).

Now, we need to determine the location of point J such that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

Let me denote J as (x, y). We need to satisfy:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ.

But where are X and Y located? Earlier, I assumed Z is at (1,0), and Y is at (0,0). What about X? Since points W, X, Y, Z are on DC (x-axis), and we've placed Y at (0,0) and Z at (1,0). Need to determine X's position. Let me assume that X is between Y and Z. Let me say X is at (a, 0), where a is between 0 and 1. But since angle WXJ is given, which involves point W. Let me assume W is to the left of X on DC. For example, suppose W is at (-w, 0), X at (a, 0), Y at (0,0), Z at (1, 0), with w, a positive numbers.

But without knowing exact positions, maybe it's better to assign specific values. Let me choose X at (0.5, 0), halfway between Y(0,0) and Z(1,0). So X is at (0.5, 0). Then W is somewhere to the left of X, say at (-0.5, 0). So W=(-0.5, 0), X=(0.5, 0), Y=(0,0), Z=(1, 0).

Now, angle WXJ is 130°, which is the angle at X between W and J. So with X at (0.5, 0), W at (-0.5, 0), and J somewhere in the plane.

Let me find coordinates of J such that angle WXJ is 130°. To do this, I can use the fact that the angle between vectors XW and XJ is 130°.

Vector XW is W - X = (-0.5 - 0.5, 0 - 0) = (-1, 0).

Vector XJ is J - X = (x - 0.5, y - 0) = (x - 0.5, y).

The angle between vectors XW and XJ is 130°, so:

cos(θ) = (XW · XJ) / (|XW| |XJ|)

Where θ = 130°.

Calculating the dot product:

XW · XJ = (-1)*(x - 0.5) + 0*y = -x + 0.5.

|XW| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2) = 1.

|XJ| = sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 ).

So:

cos(130°) = (-x + 0.5)/sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 )

Let me write this as:

(-x + 0.5) = cos(130°) * sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 )

Square both sides to eliminate square root:

(x - 0.5)^2 = cos²(130°) * [ (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 ]

Expand:

(x - 0.5)^2 = cos²(130°) * (x - 0.5)^2 + cos²(130°) * y^2

Bring terms together:

(x - 0.5)^2 - cos²(130°)*(x - 0.5)^2 = cos²(130°) * y^2

Factor left side:

[(1 - cos²(130°))] * (x - 0.5)^2 = cos²(130°) * y^2

Note that 1 - cos²(θ) = sin²(θ):

sin²(130°) * (x - 0.5)^2 = cos²(130°) * y^2

Take square roots:

sin(130°) * |x - 0.5| = cos(130°) * |y|

Assuming J is above the x-axis (since angle WXJ is 130°, which is obtuse, and given the other angles), we can drop absolute values if we consider appropriate signs.

Let me assume that J is above the x-axis, so y > 0. Also, depending on the position of J, x - 0.5 could be positive or negative. Let me suppose that J is such that x < 0.5, so x - 0.5 is negative. But since we have |x - 0.5|, it becomes -(x - 0.5) = 0.5 - x.

So:

sin(130°) * (0.5 - x) = cos(130°) * y

Therefore:

y = [ sin(130°) / cos(130°) ] * (0.5 - x) = tan(130°) * (0.5 - x)

Calculate tan(130°). Note that 130° = 180° - 50°, so tan(130°) = -tan(50°) ≈ -1.191753592.

So:

y ≈ -1.191753592 * (0.5 - x)

So this gives us a relation between x and y for point J. 

Now, we also have the ratio condition IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. Let me write expressions for these lengths.

First, compute IJ, XJ, HJ, YJ.

Coordinates:

- I ≈ (0.0603, 0.3420)
- X = (0.5, 0)
- Y = (0, 0)
- H ≈ (0.03015, 0.1710)
- J = (x, y), with y ≈ -1.191753592 * (0.5 - x)

Let me compute IJ:

IJ = sqrt( (x - I_x)^2 + (y - I_y)^2 )

XJ = sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 )

HJ = sqrt( (x - H_x)^2 + (y - H_y)^2 )

YJ = sqrt( (x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(x² + y² )

So the ratio IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ.

Substituting:

sqrt( (x - I_x)^2 + (y - I_y)^2 ) / sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 ) = sqrt( (x - H_x)^2 + (y - H_y)^2 ) / sqrt(x² + y² )

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt( (x - I_x)^2 + (y - I_y)^2 ) * sqrt(x² + y² ) = sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (x - H_x)^2 + (y - H_y)^2 )

This seems complex, but maybe squaring both sides will help:

[ (x - I_x)^2 + (y - I_y)^2 ] * (x² + y² ) = [ (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 ] * [ (x - H_x)^2 + (y - H_y)^2 ]

This equation relates x and y, with y expressed in terms of x via the earlier relation from the angle condition. Substituting y = tan(130°)*(0.5 - x) ≈ -1.191753592*(0.5 - x).

This seems very algebra-heavy. Perhaps plugging in numerical values would help, but it's quite tedious manually. Instead, maybe there's a geometric insight I'm missing.

Let me think differently. Given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and points H and I are on line GY, while J is some point related to X and Y through the angle condition.

Perhaps applying Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem?

Alternatively, consider that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ suggests that J lies on some specific locus, possibly the circumcircle or something similar.

Alternatively, since H and I are on line GY, and we're relating distances from J to H, I, X, Y, maybe there's a reflection or inversion property.

Wait, another idea: if IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, then by the converse of the angle bisector theorem, if the ratio of sides is equal, then the line J divides the angle... Wait, but this applies to triangles. For example, if in triangle XY..., but not sure.

Alternatively, since the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, maybe J lies on the intersection of two loci: one derived from the angle condition and another from the ratio condition.

But without concrete coordinates, this is hard. Let me try to proceed numerically with approximate values.

Earlier, I had:

y ≈ -1.191753592*(0.5 - x)

Let me plug this into the ratio equation.

First, calculate y ≈ -1.191753592*(0.5 - x).

Let me denote k = tan(130°) ≈ -1.191753592.

So y = k*(0.5 - x).

Now, substitute into the equation:

Left side: [(x - I_x)^2 + (y - I_y)^2] * (x² + y² )

Right side: [(x - 0.5)^2 + y^2] * [(x - H_x)^2 + (y - H_y)^2 ]

Plugging in values for I_x, I_y, H_x, H_y:

I_x ≈ 0.0603, I_y ≈ 0.3420

H_x ≈ 0.03015, H_y ≈ 0.1710

So substituting:

Left Side = [(x - 0.0603)^2 + (k*(0.5 - x) - 0.3420)^2] * [x² + (k*(0.5 - x))^2]

Right Side = [(x - 0.5)^2 + (k*(0.5 - x))^2] * [(x - 0.03015)^2 + (k*(0.5 - x) - 0.1710)^2]

This is still complex, but maybe we can find x numerically.

Let me denote t = 0.5 - x. Then x = 0.5 - t.

Then y = k*t.

Let me rewrite everything in terms of t.

Let me substitute x = 0.5 - t, so t = 0.5 - x.

Then:

Left Side:

[( (0.5 - t) - 0.0603 )^2 + (k*t - 0.3420)^2 ] * [ (0.5 - t)^2 + (k*t)^2 ]

Simplify the first term inside Left Side:

(0.5 - t - 0.0603)^2 = (0.4397 - t)^2

Second term: (kt - 0.3420)^2

So Left Side becomes:

[ (0.4397 - t)^2 + (kt - 0.3420)^2 ] * [ (0.5 - t)^2 + (kt)^2 ]

Right Side:

[( (0.5 - t) - 0.5 )^2 + (kt)^2 ] * [ ((0.5 - t) - 0.03015)^2 + (kt - 0.1710)^2 ]

Simplify Right Side:

First term inside first bracket: ( -t )^2 + (kt)^2 = t²(1 + k²)

Second term inside second bracket:

(0.5 - t - 0.03015)^2 + (kt - 0.1710)^2 = (0.46985 - t)^2 + (kt - 0.1710)^2

So Right Side becomes:

t²(1 + k²) * [ (0.46985 - t)^2 + (kt - 0.1710)^2 ]

Now, equate Left Side and Right Side:

[ (0.4397 - t)^2 + (kt - 0.3420)^2 ] * [ (0.5 - t)^2 + (kt)^2 ] = t²(1 + k²) * [ (0.46985 - t)^2 + (kt - 0.1710)^2 ]

This equation in variable t. Let me plug in k ≈ -1.191753592.

Let me compute k ≈ -1.191753592.

Let me denote k ≈ -1.1918 for approximation.

Now, this equation is highly non-linear and solving analytically is difficult, so I'll need to estimate t numerically.

Let me try to guess a value for t. Since J is forming angle WXJ of 130°, which is large, so likely J is in a region where x is less than 0.5 (since angle is obtuse), so t = 0.5 - x > 0.

Let me try t = 0.2 (so x = 0.3). Let's see:

Compute Left Side:

First part: (0.4397 - 0.2)^2 + (k*0.2 - 0.3420)^2

= (0.2397)^2 + (-1.1918*0.2 - 0.3420)^2

Calculate:

-1.1918*0.2 = -0.23836

-0.23836 - 0.3420 = -0.58036

So squared: (0.2397)^2 ≈ 0.0575, (-0.58036)^2 ≈ 0.3369 → total ≈ 0.0575 + 0.3369 ≈ 0.3944

Second part: (0.5 - 0.2)^2 + (k*0.2)^2 = (0.3)^2 + ( -0.23836 )^2 ≈ 0.09 + 0.057 ≈ 0.147

Multiply Left Side: 0.3944 * 0.147 ≈ 0.0579

Right Side: t²(1 + k²) * [...] 

First compute t²(1 + k²) = (0.2)^2 * (1 + (1.1918)^2) ≈ 0.04 * (1 + 1.4204) ≈ 0.04 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.0968

Now compute the second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.2)^2 + (k*0.2 - 0.1710)^2

= (0.26985)^2 + (-0.23836 - 0.1710)^2

≈ 0.0728 + (-0.40936)^2 ≈ 0.0728 + 0.1676 ≈ 0.2404

Multiply by 0.0968: 0.2404 * 0.0968 ≈ 0.0233

Compare Left Side (0.0579) vs Right Side (0.0233). Not equal. So t=0.2 is too small.

Try larger t, say t=0.3 (x=0.2).

Left Side first part: (0.4397 - 0.3)^2 + (k*0.3 - 0.3420)^2

= (0.1397)^2 + (-1.1918*0.3 - 0.3420)^2

Calculate:

-1.1918*0.3 ≈ -0.35754

-0.35754 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.69954 → squared ≈ 0.4893

First part ≈ (0.1397)^2 ≈ 0.0195 + 0.4893 ≈ 0.5088

Second part: (0.5 - 0.3)^2 + (k*0.3)^2 = 0.04 + ( -0.35754 )^2 ≈ 0.04 + 0.1278 ≈ 0.1678

Left Side total: 0.5088 * 0.1678 ≈ 0.0854

Right Side: t²(1 + k²) = 0.09 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.2178

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.3)^2 + (k*0.3 - 0.1710)^2

= (0.16985)^2 + (-0.35754 - 0.1710)^2 ≈ 0.0288 + (-0.5285)^2 ≈ 0.0288 + 0.2793 ≈ 0.3081

Multiply by 0.2178: 0.3081 * 0.2178 ≈ 0.0672

Still Left Side (0.0854) > Right Side (0.0672). Need to increase t further.

Try t=0.35 (x=0.15).

First part: (0.4397 - 0.35)^2 + (k*0.35 - 0.3420)^2

= (0.0897)^2 + (-1.1918*0.35 - 0.3420)^2

Calculate:

-1.1918*0.35 ≈ -0.41713

-0.41713 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.75913 → squared ≈ 0.5763

First part ≈ (0.0897)^2 ≈ 0.0081 + 0.5763 ≈ 0.5844

Second part: (0.5 - 0.35)^2 + (k*0.35)^2 = (0.15)^2 + (-0.41713)^2 ≈ 0.0225 + 0.174 ≈ 0.1965

Left Side total: 0.5844 * 0.1965 ≈ 0.1147

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = (0.35)^2 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.1225 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.296

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.35)^2 + (k*0.35 - 0.1710)^2

= (0.11985)^2 + (-0.41713 - 0.1710)^2 ≈ 0.0144 + (-0.5881)^2 ≈ 0.0144 + 0.3459 ≈ 0.3603

Multiply by 0.296: 0.3603 * 0.296 ≈ 0.1065

Now Left Side ≈ 0.1147 vs Right Side ≈ 0.1065. Still Left > Right. Need higher t.

Try t=0.4 (x=0.1):

First part: (0.4397 - 0.4)^2 + (k*0.4 - 0.3420)^2

= (0.0397)^2 + (-1.1918*0.4 - 0.3420)^2

Calculate:

-1.1918*0.4 ≈ -0.4767

-0.4767 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.8187 → squared ≈ 0.6699

First part ≈ (0.0397)^2 ≈ 0.00157 + 0.6699 ≈ 0.6715

Second part: (0.5 - 0.4)^2 + (k*0.4)^2 = (0.1)^2 + (-0.4767)^2 ≈ 0.01 + 0.2273 ≈ 0.2373

Left Side total: 0.6715 * 0.2373 ≈ 0.1592

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = 0.16 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.3873

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.4)^2 + (k*0.4 - 0.1710)^2

= (0.06985)^2 + (-0.4767 - 0.1710)^2 ≈ 0.0049 + (-0.6477)^2 ≈ 0.0049 + 0.4195 ≈ 0.4244

Multiply by 0.3873: 0.4244 * 0.3873 ≈ 0.1643

Now Left Side ≈ 0.1592 vs Right Side ≈ 0.1643. Closer! Left < Right.

So at t=0.4, Left < Right. Previously at t=0.35, Left > Right. So solution is between t=0.35 and t=0.4.

Let me try t=0.375 (x=0.125).

First part: (0.4397 - 0.375)^2 + (k*0.375 - 0.3420)^2

= (0.0647)^2 + (-1.1918*0.375 - 0.3420)^2

Calculate:

-1.1918*0.375 ≈ -0.4469

-0.4469 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.7889 → squared ≈ 0.6224

First part ≈ (0.0647)^2 ≈ 0.00419 + 0.6224 ≈ 0.6266

Second part: (0.5 - 0.375)^2 + (k*0.375)^2 = (0.125)^2 + (-0.4469)^2 ≈ 0.0156 + 0.1997 ≈ 0.2153

Left Side total: 0.6266 * 0.2153 ≈ 0.1347

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = (0.375)^2 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.1406 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.3402

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.375)^2 + (k*0.375 - 0.1710)^2

= (0.09485)^2 + (-0.4469 - 0.1710)^2 ≈ 0.00899 + (-0.6179)^2 ≈ 0.00899 + 0.3817 ≈ 0.3907

Multiply by 0.3402: 0.3907 * 0.3402 ≈ 0.1329

Left Side ≈ 0.1347 vs Right Side ≈ 0.1329. Very close!

So at t=0.375, Left ≈ 0.1347, Right ≈ 0.1329. Almost equal. Let's try t=0.376.

t=0.376:

First part:

0.4397 - 0.376 = 0.0637 → squared ≈ 0.00406

k*0.376 ≈ -1.1918*0.376 ≈ -0.4484

-0.4484 - 0.3420 = -0.7904 → squared ≈ 0.6247

Total first part ≈ 0.00406 + 0.6247 ≈ 0.6287

Second part: (0.5 - 0.376)^2 = (0.124)^2 = 0.015376

(k*0.376)^2 = (-0.4484)^2 ≈ 0.2010

Sum ≈ 0.015376 + 0.2010 ≈ 0.2164

Left Side total: 0.6287 * 0.2164 ≈ 0.1358

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = (0.376)^2 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.1413 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.3417

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.376)^2 = (0.09385)^2 ≈ 0.00881

k*0.376 - 0.1710 ≈ -0.4484 - 0.1710 = -0.6194 → squared ≈ 0.3837

Total second bracket: 0.00881 + 0.3837 ≈ 0.3925

Multiply by 0.3417: 0.3925 * 0.3417 ≈ 0.1338

Now Left ≈ 0.1358 vs Right ≈ 0.1338. Still Left > Right. Need slightly higher t.

Try t=0.38.

t=0.38:

First part: 0.4397 - 0.38 = 0.0597 → squared ≈ 0.00356

k*0.38 ≈ -1.1918*0.38 ≈ -0.4529

-0.4529 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.7949 → squared ≈ 0.6319

Total first part ≈ 0.00356 + 0.6319 ≈ 0.6355

Second part: (0.5 - 0.38)^2 = 0.0144 + (k*0.38)^2 ≈ 0.0144 + 0.2069 ≈ 0.2213

Left Side total: 0.6355 * 0.2213 ≈ 0.1404

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = 0.38^2 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.1444 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.3485

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.38)^2 = (0.08985)^2 ≈ 0.00807 + (k*0.38 - 0.1710)^2

k*0.38 - 0.1710 ≈ -0.4529 - 0.1710 = -0.6239 → squared ≈ 0.3892

Total second bracket ≈ 0.00807 + 0.3892 ≈ 0.3973

Multiply by 0.3485: 0.3973 * 0.3485 ≈ 0.1386

Left ≈ 0.1404 vs Right ≈ 0.1386. Close. Let's say at t=0.38, difference is ~0.0018.

At t=0.376, Left was 0.1358 vs Right 0.1338 → diff +0.0020.

At t=0.38, diff is +0.0018.

Let me try t=0.385.

t=0.385:

First part: 0.4397 - 0.385 = 0.0547 → squared ≈ 0.00299

k*0.385 ≈ -1.1918*0.385 ≈ -0.4576

-0.4576 - 0.3420 ≈ -0.7996 → squared ≈ 0.6394

Total first part ≈ 0.00299 + 0.6394 ≈ 0.6424

Second part: (0.5 - 0.385)^2 = 0.0132 + (k*0.385)^2 ≈ 0.0132 + (-0.4576)^2 ≈ 0.0132 + 0.2094 ≈ 0.2226

Left Side total: 0.6424 * 0.2226 ≈ 0.1429

Right Side: t²(1+k²) = 0.385^2 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.1482 * 2.4204 ≈ 0.3589

Second bracket: (0.46985 - 0.385)^2 = (0.08485)^2 ≈ 0.0072 + (k*0.385 - 0.1710)^2

k*0.385 - 0.1710 ≈ -0.4576 - 0.1710 = -0.6286 → squared ≈ 0.3952

Total second bracket ≈ 0.0072 + 0.3952 = 0.4024

Multiply by 0.3589: 0.4024 * 0.3589 ≈ 0.1446

Now Left ≈ 0.1429 vs Right ≈ 0.1446 → Left < Right.

So between t=0.38 and t=0.385, the Left crosses from greater to lesser. Let's interpolate.

At t=0.38, Left=0.1404, Right=0.1386 → difference +0.0018

At t=0.385, Left=0.1429, Right=0.1446 → difference -0.0017

Assume linear behavior between these points. Let me find t where Left = Right.

Let me denote f(t) = Left - Right.

At t=0.38, f(t)=+0.0018

At t=0.385, f(t)=-0.0017

Change in t: 0.385 - 0.38 = 0.005

Need to find delta_t where f(t)=0.

Assume linear: delta_t = 0.005 * (0.0018)/(0.0018 + 0.0017) ≈ 0.005 * (0.0018/0.0035) ≈ 0.005 * 0.514 ≈ 0.00257

So t ≈ 0.38 + 0.00257 ≈ 0.38257

Let me take t ≈ 0.3826.

Now, with t ≈ 0.3826, x = 0.5 - t ≈ 0.1174.

Now, with this x, we can find y = k*t ≈ -1.1918 * 0.3826 ≈ -0.4557.

So J has coordinates approximately (0.1174, -0.4557). Wait, but earlier assumption was that J is above x-axis since angle WXJ is 130°, but here y is negative. This suggests that J is below the x-axis. Is that possible?

Yes, because the angle at X between W and J could be 130° even if J is below the x-axis. Let me verify.

With J at (0.1174, -0.4557), let's check the angle WXJ.

Vector XW is W - X = (-0.5 - 0.5, 0 - 0) = (-1, 0).

Vector XJ is J - X = (0.1174 - 0.5, -0.4557 - 0) = (-0.3826, -0.4557).

The angle between vectors (-1, 0) and (-0.3826, -0.4557).

Compute the cosine of the angle:

cos(theta) = [ (-1)(-0.3826) + 0*(-0.4557) ] / ( |XW| * |XJ| )

Numerator: 0.3826

Denominator: |XW| = 1, |XJ| = sqrt( (-0.3826)^2 + (-0.4557)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.1463 + 0.2076) ≈ sqrt(0.3539) ≈ 0.5949

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.3826 / 0.5949 ≈ 0.643

Which corresponds to theta ≈ arccos(0.643) ≈ 49.9 degrees. Wait, but the given angle is 130 degrees. This contradicts our assumption. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Because earlier, when I derived the expression for y, I assumed that J is above the x-axis, but the actual computation shows J is below. This suggests that my earlier assumption about the sign was wrong.

Let me revisit the equation:

From the angle condition, we had:

sin(130°)*(0.5 - x) = cos(130°)*y

But since cos(130°) is negative (cos(130°) = cos(180°-50°) = -cos(50°) ≈ -0.6428), and sin(130°) is positive (sin(130°) = sin(50°) ≈ 0.7660).

So:

0.7660*(0.5 - x) = -0.6428 * y

Rearranged:

y = - [0.7660 / 0.6428] * (0.5 - x) ≈ -1.1918*(0.5 - x)

Which is what I had before. So y = -1.1918*(0.5 - x). If 0.5 - x is positive, then y is negative. Hence, J is below the x-axis.

But then, the angle between vectors XW and XJ is computed as having cosine ≈ 0.643, giving angle ≈ 49.9°, but we needed 130°. There's a contradiction here. What went wrong?

Ah! Because the angle between vectors depends on the orientation. When calculating the angle between two vectors, the angle could be the acute or obtuse angle, depending on the direction of the vectors.

In our case, vector XW is (-1, 0), and vector XJ is (-0.3826, -0.4557). These vectors are both in the second quadrant (since XJ has negative x and negative y). The angle between them is measured from XW to XJ, which would be clockwise or counterclockwise. Depending on the orientation, the angle could be 130°.

Let me recalculate the angle.

The vectors are:

XW: from X to W: (-1, 0) (pointing to the left)

XJ: from X to J: (-0.3826, -0.4557) (pointing to the third quadrant)

The angle between them is the angle between two vectors in the second and third quadrants. Let me compute it properly.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (XW · XJ) / (|XW| |XJ|)

As before, XW · XJ = 0.3826

|XW| = 1, |XJ| ≈ 0.5949

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.3826 / 0.5949 ≈ 0.643, which gives theta ≈ 49.9°, but this is the smaller angle between the vectors. The actual angle WXJ could be the reflex angle, which would be 360° - 49.9° = 310.1°, which doesn't make sense. Or, since the angle is supposed to be 130°, perhaps there's an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the vectors. The angle at X is between W-X-J, so the vectors should be from X to W and from X to J.

Wait, the angle at X is formed by points W, X, J. So the vectors are XW and XJ. But in the calculation, I used vector XW (from X to W) and XJ (from X to J). But in reality, the angle between W-X-J is the angle between XW and XJ, but depending on the direction of the vectors, it might require taking the supplementary angle.

Wait, the formula gives the smallest angle between the two vectors, which is acute or obtuse. If the computed angle is acute, but the actual angle in the diagram is obtuse, then we need to take 180° minus that angle.

So in our case, the computed angle is approximately 49.9°, but the actual angle is supposed to be 130°, which is supplementary. So 180° - 49.9° = 130.1°, which matches the given 130°. Great! So the calculation is correct. So the angle is indeed 130°, and the coordinates are correct.

Now, with J at approximately (0.1174, -0.4557), let's proceed to find angle YIZ.

Point I is at (0.0603, 0.3420), point Y is at (0, 0), and point Z is at (1, 0). We need to find angle YIZ, which is the angle at point I between points Y and Z.

So, angle YIZ is the angle at I between Y and Z. To compute this angle, we can use vectors.

Vectors IY and IZ.

Vector IY = Y - I = (0 - 0.0603, 0 - 0.3420) = (-0.0603, -0.3420)

Vector IZ = Z - I = (1 - 0.0603, 0 - 0.3420) = (0.9397, -0.3420)

Now, the angle between vectors IY and IZ at point I is what we need.

Use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (IY · IZ) / (|IY| |IZ|)

Compute IY · IZ = (-0.0603)(0.9397) + (-0.3420)(-0.3420) ≈ -0.0566 + 0.1169 ≈ 0.0603

|IY| = sqrt((-0.0603)^2 + (-0.3420)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0036 + 0.1169) ≈ sqrt(0.1205) ≈ 0.3473

|IZ| = sqrt((0.9397)^2 + (-0.3420)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.8831 + 0.1169) = sqrt(1.0) = 1.0

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.0603 / (0.3473 * 1.0) ≈ 0.0603 / 0.3473 ≈ 0.1736

Now, arccos(0.1736) is approximately 80 degrees (since cos(80°) ≈ 0.1736). Wait, cos(80°) ≈ 0.1736, yes.

So angle YIZ is approximately 80 degrees. However, none of the answer choices include 80°. The closest options are A. 40, B. 50, C. 65, D. 110. Hmm, this suggests a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Let me double-check the computations.

First, computing IY · IZ:

IY = (-0.0603, -0.3420)

IZ = (0.9397, -0.3420)

Dot product: (-0.0603)(0.9397) + (-0.3420)(-0.3420)

First term: -0.0603 * 0.9397 ≈ -0.0566

Second term: (+0.3420)^2 = 0.1169

Total ≈ -0.0566 + 0.1169 = 0.0603. Correct.

|IY|: sqrt( (-0.0603)^2 + (-0.3420)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.1169) = sqrt(0.1205) ≈ 0.3473. Correct.

|IZ|: sqrt( (0.9397)^2 + (-0.3420)^2 ) = sqrt(0.8831 + 0.1169) = sqrt(1.0) = 1.0. Correct.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.0603 / 0.3473 ≈ 0.1736, which is cos(80°), so theta ≈ 80°. But none of the options is 80°. This suggests either a miscalculation or a misinterpretation of the problem.

Wait, let me check if I correctly identified the angle YIZ. The angle at I between Y and Z. Yes, that's the angle between vectors IY and IZ. So according to this, it's approximately 80°
