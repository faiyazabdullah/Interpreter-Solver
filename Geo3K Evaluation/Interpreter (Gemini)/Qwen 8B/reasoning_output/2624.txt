MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: Line(A,C), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(C,E), and Line(A,B). Also, angles at point C involving points E, A, D, and B. The measures of these angles are given as expressions in terms of x. Specifically, angle ECA (which I think is ∠ECD?) Wait, no, the angle is labeled as Angle(E,C,A), which would be ∠ECA. Similarly, Angle(A,C,D) is ∠ACD. 

The problem states that the measure of angle ECA is 2x - 4, and angle ACD is 2x + 4. Then it says that when you add those two measures together, they equal 180 degrees. So, adding 2x - 4 and 2x + 4 gives 4x. And since their sum is 180°, then 4x = 180°, so x = 45. Wait, but then substituting back into the measures: angle ECA would be 2*45 - 4 = 90 - 4 = 86°, and angle ACD would be 2*45 + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94°. Adding them gives 86 + 94 = 180°, which checks out. But the question asks for the measure of angle 10, which is labeled as m∠10 = 2x + 4. Wait, but according to the problem statement, angle 10 is likely referring to angle ACD? Because angle ECA is angle 9? Let me check again.

Wait, the problem mentions m∠9 = 2x - 4, m∠10 = 2x + 4. So angle 9 is ∠ECA (since that's the first angle mentioned, maybe labeled as 9?), and angle 10 is ∠ACD. Therefore, once we find x, we can compute angle 10 as 2x + 4. If x is 45, then angle 10 is 2*45 + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94°, which corresponds to option B. But wait, let me make sure there isn't something else here.

But hold on, the problem also mentions some other constraints. For example, points A, B, C are connected via line AB. Points C lies on line AB? Wait, the constraints say PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A,B)). So point C is on line AB. That means that line AB passes through point C. Also, lines CD and CE start at C. So, line CD and CE are two different lines starting at point C, which is on line AB. Therefore, angles at point C between line AC and CD (∠ACD) and between line EC and CA (∠ECA) are adjacent? Or maybe forming a linear pair?

Wait, because if line AB contains point C, then line CD and CE are two different lines starting at C. However, since angle ECA is between EC and CA, and angle ACD is between AC and CD. Since CA is part of line AB (since C is on AB), then angle ECA and angle ACD might form a linear pair. Wait, if you imagine line AB with point C on it. From point C, there are two lines: CD and CE. So, angle between EC and CA (which is along AB) is ∠ECA, and angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD. Since CA is going towards A (on line AB), and CD is another line from C. Depending on the direction of CD, perhaps these two angles are supplementary? Because if CD and CE are on opposite sides of AB, then the angles could add up to 180 degrees.

So the problem says that Add(MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,A)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,D))) equals 180°. Which confirms that these two angles are supplementary. Hence, solving 2x - 4 + 2x + 4 = 180 → 4x = 180 → x = 45. Then, angle 10 is 2x + 4 = 2*45 + 4 = 94°. So the answer should be B. But let me check if there are any other constraints that might affect this.

Looking back, the problem also includes IntersectAt(Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Point(C)) and IntersectAt(Line(A,B), Line(C,E), Point(C)). This just confirms that lines CD and CE intersect line AB at point C, which we already knew since C is on AB. So nothing new there. 

Therefore, the calculation seems straightforward. Solving 4x = 180 gives x=45, leading to angle 10 being 94°, which is option B. So the final answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 10$, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- Two angles at point $C$ are defined:
  - $\angle ECA = 2x - 4$
  - $\angle ACD = 2x + 4$

These two angles are **supplementary**, meaning their measures add up to $180^\circ$. This relationship is explicitly stated in the constraint:

$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle ECA) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ACD) = 180^\circ
$$

### Step 1: Set Up the Equation
Using the expressions for the angle measures:

$$
(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180
$$

### Step 2: Simplify and Solve for $x$
Combine like terms:

$$
4x = 180
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
x = 45
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Measure of $\angle 10$
We are told that $\angle 10 = 2x + 4$. Substituting $x = 45$:

$$
\angle 10 = 2(45) + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94^\circ
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{B}
