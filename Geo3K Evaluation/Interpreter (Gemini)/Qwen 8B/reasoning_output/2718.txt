MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 1 here. So, we have a triangle DEF with points D, E, F. There are several lines and angles mentioned. Let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind based on the given information.

First, Triangle DEF. The angles at D, E, F are given as Angle(D,E,F) = 25 degrees, Angle(D,F,E) = 65 degrees. Wait, that's angle at E? Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. Let me recall: Angle(D,E,F) means the angle at point E between points D and F. Similarly, Angle(D,F,E) would be the angle at point F between D and E. Wait no, wait. Wait, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(D,E,F) is angle at E, so between DE and EF. Then Angle(D,F,E) would be angle at F between DF and FE. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me note down the given angles:

- Measure of Angle(D,E,F) is 25°. That's angle at E, between D-E-F. So ∠DEF = 25°?

Wait, standard notation for angle ABC is angle at point B. So yes, Angle(D,E,F) is angle at E. Therefore, ∠DEF = 25°, which is at E.

Similarly, Angle(D,F,E) is angle at F between D-F-E. So ∠DFE = 65°, since it's angle at F. So in triangle DEF, angles at E (25°) and F (65°). Therefore, the third angle at D would be 180 - 25 - 65 = 90°. So ∠EDF = 90°. Wait, that makes sense because then triangle DEF would be a right-angled triangle at D. Because the sum of angles is 25 + 65 + 90 = 180. So that checks out. So triangle DEF has a right angle at D.

Now, there's also a point G such that Line(D,G) is drawn. Also, Perpendicular(Line(D,G), Line(E,F)). So line DG is perpendicular to line EF. And RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)), meaning that angle at G between D-G-F is a right angle. So triangle DGF is a right triangle at G. Also, Point G lies on line EF. Wait, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,F)) — so point G is somewhere on line EF. But since DG is perpendicular to EF, and G is on EF, then DG is the altitude from D to EF? Or perhaps extending EF?

But given that triangle DGF is right-angled at G, so DG is perpendicular to GF. Since G is on EF, then GF is part of EF. So DG is perpendicular to EF. So that makes sense.

Also, there's another triangle DGE, which is right-angled at G. Because RightAngle(Angle(D,G,E)), so angle at G between D-G-E is 90°. So triangle DGE is right-angled at G. Therefore, point G is on line EF such that DG is perpendicular to EF, making two right triangles: DGF and DGE.

So, given that, we need to find the measure of angle 1, which is equal to MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)). Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)), MeasureOf(Angle(1))). So angle 1 is equal to angle EDG, which is the angle at D between E-D-G. Wait, angle EDG is at D? Wait, no. Angle(E,D,G) is the angle at D between E and G. So that's ∠EDG. So angle 1 is ∠EDG. We need to find its measure.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since DG is perpendicular to EF, and G lies on EF, then DG is the height from D to EF. In triangle DEF, which is right-angled at D. Wait, but EF is the hypotenuse of triangle DEF. Because DEF has a right angle at D, so EF is the hypotenuse. So DG is the altitude from D to hypotenuse EF. 

In a right-angled triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse has some known properties. For example, the length of the altitude can be found using area, etc., but here we might need angles.

Alternatively, since DG is perpendicular to EF, and G is on EF, we can consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me place point D at origin (0,0). Since triangle DEF is right-angled at D, let me assume that DE is along x-axis and DF is along y-axis. Wait, but angle at D is 90°, so DE and DF are legs. However, earlier calculation showed that in triangle DEF, angles at E is 25°, at F is 65°, so sides opposite these angles would be proportional to sin of those angles. Alternatively, maybe assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me suppose D is at (0,0). Let me take DE along x-axis. So point E is at (a, 0) for some a. DF is along y-axis, so point F is at (0, b) for some b. Then EF connects (a,0) to (0,b). The equation of line EF is x/a + y/b = 1. Now, point G lies on EF, and DG is perpendicular to EF. So DG is the altitude from D(0,0) to line EF.

The slope of EF is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. Therefore, the slope of DG, being perpendicular, is a/b. Since DG passes through D(0,0), its equation is y = (a/b)x.

Intersection point G is where DG meets EF. So solving equations:

EF: x/a + y/b = 1

DG: y = (a/b)x

Substituting y into EF equation:

x/a + (a/b * x)/b = 1 → x/a + (a x)/b² = 1 → x(1/a + a / b² ) = 1 → x = 1 / (1/a + a / b² )

Hmm, maybe messy. Alternatively, parametrize EF. Let me use parameters.

Alternatively, in right triangle DEF with right angle at D, DE = adjacent side to angle at E (which is 25°), DF = adjacent to angle at F (65°). Wait, angle at E is 25°, so tan(angle E) = opposite/adjacent = DF / DE. Since angle E is 25°, tan(25°) = DF / DE. Similarly, angle at F is 65°, so tan(65°) = DE / DF. Let me check that.

Yes, in triangle DEF, angle at E is 25°, so tan(25°) = opposite over adjacent. Opposite to angle E is DF, adjacent is DE. So tan(25°) = DF / DE. Similarly, angle at F is 65°, tan(65°) = DE / DF. So multiplying these two equations:

tan(25°)*tan(65°) = (DF / DE)*(DE / DF) = 1. Which is true because tan(θ)*tan(90°−θ)= tanθ*cotθ=1. Since 25+65=90, so that works. So that's consistent.

Therefore, we can assign values to DE and DF. Let me pick specific lengths for simplicity. Let me assume DE = 1 unit. Then DF = tan(25°). Wait, tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663. But maybe better to use exact expressions. Alternatively, assign DE = tan(65°), DF = 1. Wait, since tan(65°) = DE / DF. If I take DF = 1, then DE = tan(65°). Let me compute tan(65°): approximately 2.1445. So DE ≈ 2.1445, DF = 1. Then EF can be computed via Pythagoras: sqrt(DE² + DF²) = sqrt((2.1445)^2 + 1^2) ≈ sqrt(4.598 + 1) ≈ sqrt(5.598) ≈ 2.366 units.

But maybe instead of actual numbers, work symbolically. Let me denote DE = m, DF = n. Then tan(25°) = n/m, tan(65°) = m/n. As before.

Now, the coordinates: D(0,0), E(m,0), F(0,n). Equation of EF: connecting (m,0) to (0,n). Parametric equations: x = m - mt, y = nt, where t ∈ [0,1].

Equation of DG: perpendicular to EF, passing through D(0,0). As before, slope of EF is -n/m, so slope of DG is m/n. Hence equation y = (m/n)x.

To find point G, intersection of DG and EF.

Parametrize EF as x = m(1 - t), y = n t, for t between 0 and 1.

Plug into DG equation: y = (m/n)x → n t = (m/n)(m(1 - t)) → n t = (m² / n)(1 - t).

Multiply both sides by n: n² t = m² (1 - t)

Then, t(n² + m²) = m² → t = m²/(m² + n²)

Thus, coordinates of G are x = m(1 - t) = m[1 - m²/(m² + n²)] = m[(m² + n² - m²)/(m² + n²)] = m[n²/(m² + n²)] = (m n²)/(m² + n²)

y-coordinate is n t = n*(m²)/(m² + n²) = (m² n)/(m² + n²)

So coordinates of G are ((m n²)/(m² + n²), (m² n)/(m² + n²))

Now, we need to find angle 1, which is ∠EDG. Let me see. ∠EDG is the angle at D between points E, D, G. So vectors DE and DG. Since D is at origin, vector DE is E - D = (m, 0), and vector DG is G - D = ( (m n²)/(m² + n²), (m² n)/(m² + n²) )

So angle between DE (along x-axis) and DG can be found via dot product.

Dot product of DE and DG vectors is (m, 0) • ( (m n²)/(m² + n²), (m² n)/(m² + n²) ) = m*(m n²)/(m² + n²) + 0*... = m² n² / (m² + n²)

Magnitude of DE vector is sqrt(m² + 0) = m

Magnitude of DG vector is sqrt( [ (m n²/(m² + n²))² + (m² n/(m² + n²))² ] )

Factor out (m² n²)/(m² + n²)^2 inside sqrt:

sqrt( [ m² n^4 + m^4 n² ] / (m² + n²)^2 ) = sqrt( m² n² (n² + m²) / (m² + n²)^2 )) = sqrt( m² n² / (m² + n²) ) = (mn)/sqrt(m² + n²)

Therefore, cos(theta) = (dot product)/(|DE| |DG|) = [ m² n² / (m² + n²) ] / [ m * (mn)/sqrt(m² + n²) ) ] = [ m² n² / (m² + n²) ] / [ m² n / sqrt(m² + n²) ) ] = [ m² n² / (m² + n²) ] * [ sqrt(m² + n²) / (m² n) ) ] = [ m n / sqrt(m² + n²) ]

So cos(theta) = mn / sqrt(m² + n²)

But theta is the angle between DE and DG, which is ∠EDG, which is angle 1.

So angle 1 = arccos( mn / sqrt(m² + n²) )

Hmm, but we need to express this in terms of known angles. Remember that in triangle DEF, angles at E is 25°, at F is 65°, and right angle at D. From earlier, tan(25°) = DF / DE = n/m. Let me write that as tan(25°) = n/m → n = m tan(25°). Let me substitute that into the expression.

So mn = m * n = m * m tan(25°) = m² tan(25°)

And sqrt(m² + n²) = sqrt(m² + m² tan²(25°)) = m sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) = m sec(25°), since 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ.

Therefore, mn / sqrt(m² + n²) = [ m² tan(25°) ] / [ m sec(25°) ] = m tan(25°) / sec(25°) = m sin(25°)

Because tan(θ) / sec(θ) = sin(θ). So tan(25°)/sec(25°) = sin(25°). Thus, cos(theta) = m sin(25°)? Wait, but m cancels out here. Wait, let me re-express:

Wait, the previous steps:

After substitution, we had cos(theta) = [ mn ] / sqrt(m² + n²) = [ m * n ] / sqrt(m² + n²). With n = m tan(25°):

cos(theta) = [ m * m tan(25°) ] / sqrt(m² + m² tan²(25°)) = [ m² tan(25°) ] / [ m sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) ] = [ m tan(25°) ] / sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) )

Which simplifies to [ m tan(25°) ] / sec(25°) ) = m tan(25°) * cos(25°) = m sin(25°). Wait, tan(25°)*cos(25°) = sin(25°). Yes, because tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, so tan θ * cos θ = sin θ. Therefore, cos(theta) = m sin(25°)... Wait, but m was arbitrary? Wait, but m is DE, which is a length, but in our case, when we did substitution, the m canceled out? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the ratio depends only on the angle. Wait, but we have cos(theta) equals something that depends on m? That seems odd. Wait, no, because in reality, the angle theta (∠EDG) should be independent of the scale of the triangle. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, let's go back. When we substituted n = m tan(25°), then sqrt(m² + n²) becomes m sec(25°). So:

cos(theta) = [ m * n ] / sqrt(m² + n²) = [ m * m tan(25°) ] / [ m sec(25°) ] = [ m tan(25°) ] / sec(25°) = m tan(25°) * cos(25°) = m * sin(25°). Wait, but this still has an 'm' term. How come? This suggests that cos(theta) depends on m, which shouldn't be the case. Therefore, there must be an error in the reasoning.

Wait, but theta is the angle between DE and DG. But DG is the altitude from D to EF. In a right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse creates similar triangles. So maybe there's a relation here.

In triangle DEF, right-angled at D. The altitude DG divides the triangle into two smaller similar triangles, DGF and DGE, each similar to DEF and to each other.

Therefore, triangle DGF ~ triangle DEF. So angles correspond. In particular, angle at G in triangle DGF is 90°, as given. So in triangle DGF, which is right-angled at G, the angles would be same as original triangle?

Wait, no. Original triangle DEF has angles 25°, 65°, 90°. The altitude DG creates two smaller triangles. Let me recall that in a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse divides it into two similar triangles. So triangle DGF ~ triangle DEF ~ triangle DGE.

Therefore, in triangle DGF, angle at G is 90°, angle at F is same as angle at F in DEF, which is 65°, and angle at D is same as angle at E in DEF, which is 25°? Wait, no. Wait, similarity implies corresponding angles are equal. So triangle DGF ~ triangle DEF. So angle at D in DGF corresponds to angle at D in DEF. But angle at D in DEF is 90°, but in triangle DGF, angle at D is angle between DG and DF. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, since DG is the altitude, then in triangle DGF, angle at F is same as angle at F in DEF? Not sure. Let me think of ratios.

Alternatively, since DG is the altitude, then in triangle DEF, the length of DG can be calculated. In a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse is equal to (product of legs)/hypotenuse. So DG = (DE * DF)/EF.

Given that, and knowing angles, perhaps we can relate angles.

But maybe going back to the coordinate approach. Earlier, we saw that cos(theta) = [ mn ] / sqrt(m² + n²). But with n = m tan(25°), then:

sqrt(m² + n²) = m sec(25°)

Therefore, [ mn ] / sqrt(...) = [ m * m tan(25°) ] / [ m sec(25°) ] = m tan(25°) / sec(25°) = m sin(25°). Wait, but this still leaves us with m. This suggests that my earlier assumption that the angle theta depends on m is wrong. But theta is fixed regardless of scaling. So there's a mistake here.

Ah! Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the dot product. Let me recalculate.

Earlier, I said that the dot product of DE and DG vectors is m² n² / (m² + n²). But DE vector is (m, 0), DG vector is ( (m n²)/(m² + n²), (m² n)/(m² + n²) ). So their dot product is m * (m n²)/(m² + n²) + 0 * ... = m² n² / (m² + n²). Correct.

Then magnitude of DE is m, magnitude of DG is sqrt( [ (m n²/(m² + n²))^2 + (m² n/(m² + n²))^2 ]) = sqrt( [ m² n^4 + m^4 n² ] / (m² + n²)^2 ) = sqrt( m² n² (n² + m²) ) / (m² + n²) ) = [ m n sqrt(m² + n²) ] / (m² + n²) ) = mn / sqrt(m² + n²). Correct.

So the cosine of theta is [ m² n² / (m² + n²) ] divided by [ m * mn / sqrt(m² + n²) ) ] = [ m² n² / (m² + n²) ] * [ sqrt(m² + n²) / (m² n) ) ] = [ m n / sqrt(m² + n²) ]. Ah! Here's the mistake earlier. Previously, I thought it was [ m² n² / ... ] divided by [ m * mn / ... ] leading to mn / sqrt(...). So cos(theta) = mn / sqrt(m² + n²). Not multiplied by m anymore. 

So cos(theta) = (mn)/sqrt(m² + n²). Now, with n = m tan(25°), substituting:

mn = m * n = m * m tan(25°) = m² tan(25°)

sqrt(m² + n²) = sqrt(m² + m² tan²(25°)) = m sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) = m sec(25°)

Therefore, cos(theta) = [ m² tan(25°) ] / [ m sec(25°) ] = m tan(25°) / sec(25°) = m * [ sin(25°)/cos(25°) ] / [ 1/cos(25°) ] = m * sin(25°). Wait, but again, this gives cos(theta) = m sin(25°), which depends on m. But theta is supposed to be a fixed angle. So this suggests that there's a mistake in my setup.

Wait, but why does this depend on m? It shouldn't. Perhaps I messed up the definition of theta. Theta is the angle between DE and DG. But in reality, theta is determined purely by the geometry of the triangle, not by the scale. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation.

Let me think differently. Let's take specific numerical values. Suppose I assign DE = 1, DF = tan(25°). Then EF = sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) = sec(25°). Then DG is the altitude, which is (DE * DF)/EF = [1 * tan(25°)] / sec(25°) = tan(25°) / sec(25°) = sin(25°). So DG = sin(25°). 

Now, in triangle DGE, which is right-angled at G. So DG = sin(25°), DE = 1, and GE can be found. Wait, but maybe we can look at triangle DGE. Let me try to find angle at D, which is angle EDG (theta).

In triangle DGE, right-angled at G. So angle at D is theta, angle at G is 90°, so angle at E is 90° - theta. But angle at E in triangle DGE is the same as angle between GE and DE. Wait, but GE is part of EF. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, since DG is the altitude, in triangle DEF, the angles formed by the altitude. In a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse creates angles equal to the original angles. Wait, no. Wait, in a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse creates two smaller triangles similar to the original. So angle at G in triangle DGF is 90°, and triangle DGF is similar to DEF. So angle at F in triangle DGF is same as angle at F in DEF, which is 65°. Therefore, in triangle DGF, angle at F is 65°, angle at G is 90°, so angle at D is 180 - 65 - 90 = 25°. So angle at D in triangle DGF is 25°, which is angle FDG. Wait, angle FDG is 25°. But angle FDG is part of angle EDG?

Wait, angle FDG is the angle at D between F and G. While angle EDG is the angle at D between E and G. Since G is on EF, angle EDG is composed of angle EDF minus angle FDG? Or is it?

Wait, point G is on EF. So from point D, looking at points E and F, and G is somewhere on EF. So the angle between DE and DG is angle EDG, and the angle between DF and DG is angle FDG. Since angle EDF is 90°, we have angle EDG + angle FDG = 90°. From above, in triangle DGF, angle FDG is 25°, so angle EDG = 90° - 25° = 65°? But that contradicts earlier thoughts. Wait, but according to this, angle EDG would be 65°, but that's option C. But let's verify.

If in triangle DGF, which is similar to DEF, angle at D is 25°, then angle FDG = 25°, so angle EDG = angle EDF - angle FDG = 90° - 25° = 65°. Therefore, angle 1 is 65°, which is option C. But wait, the answer choices include C as 65. But let me cross-check.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to calculate using coordinates, I ended up with cos(theta) depending on m. But with this alternative method, it suggests angle EDG is 65°. But why does that conflict with the coordinate method? Where is the error?

Wait, in the first approach, assuming triangle DGF is similar to DEF, which is correct, since they are both right triangles and share an angle. So angle at D in DGF is same as angle at F in DEF, which is 65°? No, wait. Wait, triangle DEF has angles 90° at D, 25° at E, 65° at F. When you draw altitude DG, creating triangle DGF, which is similar to DEF. So the correspondence of angles would be:

In triangle DEF: angle at D is 90°, angle at E is 25°, angle at F is 65°.

In triangle DGF: angle at G is 90°, angle at F is same as angle at E in DEF, which is 25°, and angle at D is same as angle at F in DEF, which is 65°. Wait, no. Wait, the similarity would mean that angle at D in DGF corresponds to angle at F in DEF? Or angle at F in DGF corresponds to angle at E in DEF? Let me think carefully.

Since triangle DGF is similar to triangle DEF. The right angle in DGF is at G, which corresponds to the right angle at D in DEF. Therefore, angle at G (right angle) corresponds to angle at D (right angle) in DEF. So angle at F in DGF corresponds to angle at E in DEF. So angle at F in DGF is 25°, as angle at E in DEF. Then angle at D in DGF is 180 - 90 - 25 = 65°, which is the remaining angle. So angle at D in DGF is 65°, which is angle FDG. So angle FDG is 65°, hence angle EDG = angle EDF - angle FDG = 90° - 65° = 25°. Wait, this conflicts with previous conclusion. Which is correct?

Wait, let me think again. If triangle DGF is similar to triangle DEF, then angle at D in DGF (which is angle FDG) corresponds to angle at E in DEF (which is 25°). Wait, no. Wait, the similarity is between DGF and DEF. So the correspondence of vertices is DGF ~ DEF. So angle at D in DGF corresponds to angle at D in DEF. Wait, but angle at D in DGF is angle between DF and DG. Whereas angle at D in DEF is between DE and DF. So if DGF ~ DEF, then angle at D in DGF corresponds to angle at D in DEF, which is 90°, but that would imply that angle at D in DGF is 90°, which it isn't, because in DGF, angle at D is 65°. Therefore, my assumption about the similarity correspondence is wrong.

Actually, triangle DGF is similar to triangle DEF. Let me determine the correspondence correctly. The right angle in DGF is at G, while the right angle in DEF is at D. Therefore, the similarity would be DGF ~ DEF with correspondence G -> D, D -> E, F -> F? Not sure. Let me think about the angles.

In triangle DGF: angles are 90° at G, angle at F, and angle at D. In triangle DEF: angles are 90° at D, 25° at E, 65° at F. So matching the right angles, triangle DGF has right angle at G, so it corresponds to the right angle at D in DEF. So angle at G (90°) corresponds to angle at D (90°) in DEF. Then, angle at F in DGF corresponds to angle at E in DEF (25°), and angle at D in DGF corresponds to angle at F in DEF (65°). So in triangle DGF, angle at D is 65°, angle at F is 25°, angle at G is 90°. Therefore, angle at D in triangle DGF is 65°, which is angle FDG. Hence, angle FDG = 65°, which means that angle EDG = angle EDF - angle FDG = 90° - 65° = 25°. So angle EDG is 25°, which would make angle 1 equal to 25°, which is option A. But this contradicts the earlier thought that angle EDG is 65°. Which is correct?

This is getting confusing. Let me try with concrete numbers. Let me assign DE = 1, DF = tan(25°), so that tan(25°) = DF/DE = tan(25°). Then EF = sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) = sec(25°). The length of DG, the altitude, is (DE * DF)/EF = (1 * tan(25°))/sec(25°) = sin(25°). So DG = sin(25°). 

Now, in triangle DGF, which is right-angled at G, with FG being part of EF. Let me find angle at D (angle FDG). Using trigonometry in triangle DGF: tan(angle FDG) = opposite/adjacent = FG / DG. What is FG?

FG is the segment from F to G on EF. Since EF has length sec(25°), and G is the foot of the altitude from D to EF. In a right triangle, the length of the segments created by the altitude can be calculated. Specifically, in triangle DEF, with altitude DG, the length FG = (DF)^2 / EF = (tan^2(25°)) / sec(25°) = tan²(25°) * cos(25°) = [sin²(25°)/cos²(25°)] * cos(25°) = sin²(25°)/cos(25°).

So FG = sin²(25°)/cos(25°). And DG = sin(25°). So tan(angle FDG) = FG / DG = [sin²(25°)/cos(25°)] / sin(25°) = sin(25°)/cos(25°) = tan(25°). Therefore, angle FDG = 25°. Hence, angle FDG is 25°, so angle EDG = angle EDF - angle FDG = 90° - 25° = 65°. Therefore, angle 1 is 65°, which is option C.

Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion from similarity. Why? Because earlier, I thought that angle FDG was 65°, but now it's showing it's 25°. So which is correct?

Let me double-check. In triangle DGF, angle at D is angle FDG. We found that tan(angle FDG) = tan(25°), so angle FDG = 25°. Hence, angle EDG = 90° - 25° = 65°, which would be angle 1 = 65°, option C. But earlier, when I considered similarity, I thought angle FDG was 65°, but that was incorrect due to misapplying the correspondence. So the correct value is 65°, making angle 1 equal to 65°, option C.

But wait, the question says that angle 1 is equal to MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)), which is angle EDG. So according to this, angle 1 is 65°, option C. But let me check if there are other ways this could be approached.

Alternatively, since DG is perpendicular to EF, and in triangle DEF, which is right-angled at D, then DG is the altitude. In such cases, the angles formed by the altitude can be related to the original angles. For instance, in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse creates two angles at the hypotenuse that are equal to the original acute angles. Wait, no. Wait, the angles at the hypotenuse are split into angles equal to the original angles?

For example, in a right triangle, when you drop an altitude to the hypotenuse, the two new triangles are similar to the original triangle and to each other. So the angles remain the same. So in triangle DGF, which is similar to DEF, angle at F is same as angle at E in DEF, which is 25°, and angle at D in DGF is same as angle at F in DEF, which is 65°. Wait, but earlier calculation said angle FDG is 25°, which would suggest that angle at D in DGF is 25°, conflicting with this.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. If triangle DGF is similar to triangle DEF, then the angles in DGF are the same as in DEF. So angle at D in DGF is same as angle at E in DEF, which is 25°, angle at F in DGF is same as angle at D in DEF, which is 90°, but that contradicts since DGF has a right angle at G. So this indicates that my similarity assumption is incorrect.

Wait, the correct way is: triangle DGF is similar to triangle DEF. Let me check the angles. In triangle DEF, angles are 90°, 25°, 65°. In triangle DGF, angles are 90°, ?, ?. Since it's similar, the angles must match. So if angle at G is 90°, then one of the other angles must be 25°, and the other 65°. Which one corresponds to which?

Since DG is the altitude, the angle at F in DGF corresponds to the angle at E in DEF. So angle at F in DGF is 25°, and angle at D in DGF is 65°. Hence, angle FDG is 65°, which would mean angle EDG = 90° - 65° = 25°. But this contradicts the earlier calculation using tangent. So which is correct?

Wait, let's do it numerically. Assume DE = 1, DF = tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663. EF = sqrt(1 + tan²(25°)) ≈ 1.116. DG = (DE * DF)/EF ≈ (1 * 0.4663)/1.116 ≈ 0.418. FG = (DF²)/EF ≈ (0.4663²)/1.116 ≈ 0.217 / 1.116 ≈ 0.194. So in triangle DGF, sides DG ≈ 0.418, FG ≈ 0.194, and DF = 0.4663. Let's check angle at D (FDG). Using Law of Sines: sin(angle FDG)/FG = sin(angle at G)/DF. Angle at G is 90°, so:

sin(angle FDG)/0.194 = sin(90°)/0.4663 => sin(angle FDG) = 0.194 / 0.4663 ≈ 0.416. So angle FDG ≈ arcsin(0.416) ≈ 24.6°, which is close to 25°, considering rounding errors. Hence, angle FDG ≈ 25°, which means angle EDG = 90° - 25° = 65°, making angle 1 = 65°, option C.

But earlier, when I thought of triangle DGF being similar to DEF, I thought angle FDG was 65°, but that led to inconsistency. The correct calculation shows that angle FDG is 25°, so angle EDG is 65°. Therefore, angle 1 is 65°, which is option C.

Wait, but the problem states that there's a right triangle DGE as well, with right angle at G. Let me confirm if that affects anything. The problem says RightAngle(Angle(D,G,E)), so triangle DGE is right-angled at G. So in triangle DGE, right-angled at G, so angle at G is 90°, angle at D is angle EDG (which we're finding), and angle at E is angle GED. Since the sum is 180°, angle EDG + angle GED = 90°. But angle GED is part of angle at E in triangle DEF, which was originally 25°. But since G is on EF, angle GED is part of that 25°. Wait, but how?

Let me think. In triangle DEF, angle at E is 25°, which is angle between DE and EF. Since G is on EF, angle between DE and EG is the same as angle between DE and EF, which is 25°. But in triangle DGE, angle at E is angle between DE and GE, which is the same as angle between DE and EF, which is 25°. But triangle DGE is right-angled at G, so angle at E is 25°, angle at G is 90°, so angle at D (angle EDG) is 180 - 25 - 90 = 65°. So angle EDG is 65°, confirming that angle 1 is 65°, option C.

Yes! This matches. So angle GED is 25°, angle at G is 90°, so angle EDG = 65°. Therefore, the measure of angle 1 is 65°, option C.

But wait, the initial problem statement mentions that angle(E,D,G) is equal to angle 1. Angle(E,D,G) is angle at D, between E and G, which is angle EDG, which we just found to be 65°. So the answer is C. But let me check the options again.

Options are A.25, B.55, C.65, D.75. So 65 is option C. But earlier confusion arose due to different approaches, but finally, using triangle DGE being right-angled at G, and knowing angle at E is 25°, leads directly to angle EDG = 65°, so answer is C.

However, there's another possibility: the problem may involve more complex relationships. Let me check once more.

Another approach: Since DG is perpendicular to EF, and G is on EF, then DG is the altitude. In triangle DEF, right-angled at D, the altitude DG splits the triangle into two right triangles, DGE and DGF. 

As established, in triangle DGE, right-angled at G, with angle at E being 25° (same as original angle at E), therefore angle at D is 65°, which is angle EDG. Hence, angle 1 = 65°, option C.

Yes, this confirms it. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 1$, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem. The key elements are:

- Triangle $DEF$ is **right-angled** at $D$, with $\angle D = 90^\circ$.
- Given:  
  - $\angle D, E, F = 25^\circ$
  - $\angle D, F, E = 65^\circ$
- These imply that $\angle E = 25^\circ$ and $\angle F = 65^\circ$, confirming that triangle $DEF$ is a valid triangle with internal angles summing to $180^\circ$:  
  $$
  \angle D + \angle E + \angle F = 90^\circ + 25^\circ + 65^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$

Next, we consider the placement of point $G$, which satisfies the condition that:
- $DG \perp EF$, i.e., segment $DG$ is perpendicular to line $EF$, implying that $DG$ is the **altitude** from $D$ to the hypotenuse $EF$ of the right triangle $DEF$.
- Additionally, it is stated that:
  - $\angle D, G, F = 90^\circ$, so triangle $DGF$ is also a right triangle, right-angled at $G$.
  - $\angle D, G, E = 90^\circ$, so triangle $DGE$ is also a right triangle, right-angled at $G$.

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

We are asked to find the measure of $\angle 1$, which is defined as:
$$
\angle 1 = \angle E, D, G
$$
That is, $\angle 1$ is the angle at $D$, between segments $DE$ and $DG$. This corresponds to $\angle EDG$.

Now, observe triangle $DGE$, which is a right triangle with a right angle at $G$. The angles in triangle $DGE$ must satisfy:
$$
\angle D, G, E + \angle D, E, G + \angle E, D, G = 180^\circ
$$
We know:
- $\angle D, G, E = 90^\circ$ (from the problem),
- $\angle D, E, G$ is the angle at point $E$ in triangle $DEF$, which is given as $25^\circ$,
- Therefore, the remaining angle $\angle E, D, G = \angle 1$ is:
$$
\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 25^\circ = 65^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion:

The measure of $\angle 1$, which is $\angle E, D, G$, is $65^\circ$. Among the given answer choices, this corresponds to:

$$
\text{Final Answer: } \boxed{\text{C}}
