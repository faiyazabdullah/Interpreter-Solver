MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the length of side DF in triangle DGF. Let me start by recalling the given information. The triangle has sides DG = 15 units, GF = 19 units, and the angle at G (which is angle DGF) is 125 degrees. They want me to find the length of DF, which is opposite the angle at G. 

Hmm, since we have two sides and the included angle, the Law of Cosines seems like the right approach here. Wait, let me make sure. The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle between sides a and b. 

In this case, the sides adjacent to the angle at G are DG and GF, which are 15 and 19 respectively. So, applying the Law of Cosines, the side opposite angle G (which is DF) should be calculated as follows:

DF² = DG² + GF² - 2 * DG * GF * cos(angle DGF)

Plugging in the numbers:

DG is 15, GF is 19, angle is 125 degrees.

So first, compute each part:

DG squared is 15² = 225

GF squared is 19² = 361

Then, the product of DG, GF, and cos(125°): 15*19*cos(125°). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, multiply 15 and 19: 15*19 = 285.

Now, cos(125°). Wait, 125 degrees is in the second quadrant, so cosine will be negative there. Let me check the exact value. But maybe I can just use a calculator for this? Well, assuming I can compute cos(125°).

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that cos(125°) is equal to cos(180°−55°) = -cos(55°). So cos(125°) ≈ -cos(55°). Let me approximate cos(55°). Using a calculator, cos(55°) is approximately 0.5736. Therefore, cos(125°) ≈ -0.5736.

But maybe I should get more precise. Alternatively, use exact computation. However, for the purposes of calculation, let's proceed with approximate values.

So, 285 multiplied by cos(125°) ≈ 285 * (-0.5736) ≈ -285 * 0.5736. Let me compute that:

First, 285 * 0.5 = 142.5

285 * 0.0736 = ?

Wait, maybe better to do 285 * 0.5736 directly. Let me approximate:

Let me think of 0.5736 as roughly 0.5736. So multiplying 285 by 0.5736:

Well, 285 * 0.5 = 142.5

285 * 0.07 = 20. (since 285 * 0.07 = 19.95)

Wait, maybe breaking it down:

285 × 0.5736 = ?

Alternatively, note that 0.5736 is approximately 0.5736.

Alternatively, perhaps using decimal multiplication:

Let me consider 285 × 0.5736.

But maybe I can use a calculator here, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try:

First, 285 × 0.5 = 142.5

285 × 0.07 = 19.95

285 × 0.0036 = ?

Compute 285 × 0.0036:

Multiply 285 × 0.0036:

Well, 285 × 0.003 = 0.855

285 × 0.0006 = 0.171

Total: 0.855 + 0.171 = 1.026

Therefore, adding up the three parts:

142.5 (from 0.5) + 19.95 (from 0.07) + 1.026 (from 0.0036) = 142.5 + 19.95 = 162.45; then +1.026 gives 163.476.

But wait, that was for 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0036 = 0.5736. So total is approximately 163.476. But since the original term was negative, the entire term is -163.476.

So going back to the Law of Cosines equation:

DF² = 225 + 361 - 2*(15*19)*cos(125°)

Which simplifies to DF² = 225 + 361 - 2*(-163.476) ?

Wait no, because earlier, we had:

-2 * DG * GF * cos(theta) becomes -2 * (DG * GF) * cos(theta). Since cos(theta) is negative, this would become -2*(positive)*(negative) = positive.

Wait, let me redo that step carefully.

Original formula: DF² = DG² + GF² - 2*D G * GF * cos(angle)

So substituting the numbers:

= 225 + 361 - 2*(15)(19)*cos(125°)

We already computed 15*19 = 285, so:

= 225 + 361 - 2*285*cos(125°)

Earlier, I approximated cos(125°) as -0.5736, so:

= 586 - 2*285*(-0.5736)

Wait, because cos(125°) is negative, so multiplying by -2*285*cos(theta) becomes -2*285*(-value) = positive.

So:

Calculate 2*285 = 570

Then, 570 * 0.5736 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 570 * 0.5736.

Again, breaking it down:

First, 500 * 0.5736 = 286.8

Then, 70 * 0.5736 = 40.152

Adding them together: 286.8 + 40.152 = 326.952

Therefore, the term is +326.952.

Thus, DF² = 586 + 326.952 = 912.952

Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, DG² + GF² is 225 + 361 = 586. Correct.

Then, subtracting 2*D G * GF * cos(theta) — but theta is 125°, whose cosine is negative. So when you subtract a negative number, it becomes addition.

So the formula is DF² = 586 - [2*15*19*cos(125°)]

But cos(125°) is negative, so it's equivalent to 586 - [negative number], which is 586 + positive number.

So yes, that gives us 586 + 326.952 = 912.952.

So DF² ≈ 912.952. Then taking square root of that gives DF ≈ sqrt(912.952).

What is sqrt(912.952)? Let me estimate that.

I know that 30^2 = 900, 31^2 = 961. So sqrt(912.95) is between 30 and 31.

Let me compute 30.2^2 = 912.04. Because 30^2 = 900, 0.2^2 = 0.04, and cross term 2*30*0.2 = 12. So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², so 30.2² = 900 + 12 + 0.04 = 912.04.

Our value is 912.952, which is higher than 912.04. Let's see how much higher.

Difference: 912.952 - 912.04 = 0.912.

So, let's approximate sqrt(912.952) ≈ 30.2 + delta.

Let me denote x = 30.2 + delta.

x² = (30.2)^2 + 2*30.2*delta + delta² = 912.04 + 60.4*delta + ... ≈ 912.04 + 60.4*delta.

Set this equal to 912.952:

912.04 + 60.4*delta ≈ 912.952

Subtract 912.04: 60.4*delta ≈ 0.912 → delta ≈ 0.912 / 60.4 ≈ 0.0151.

So x ≈ 30.2 + 0.0151 ≈ 30.2151. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 30.2.

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 30.2. So that would be the answer?

Wait, but let me verify my calculations once again because sometimes errors can creep in during manual computations.

First, verifying DF² = 15² + 19² - 2*15*19*cos(125°). Let me recalculate that.

Another way: Compute 15² + 19² = 225 + 361 = 586. Correct.

Then, compute 2*15*19 = 570. Correct.

Then, cos(125°). Let me check with a calculator. If I don't have a calculator, but perhaps I can recall that cos(120°) is -0.5, and cos(135°) is -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071. So 125° is between 120° and 135°, closer to 120°. Let me check the exact value.

Alternatively, use a calculator-like approximation. For example, using Taylor series or known values. But maybe I can use a calculator here mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the value of cos(125°). Let me think again.

If I use a calculator, cos(125°):

Convert 125 degrees to radians if needed, but for estimation, perhaps I can use a calculator. Assuming that I have access to a calculator, cos(125°) is approximately cos(125) ≈ -0.5736.

Yes, as previously thought. So 2*15*19*cos(125°) = 570 * (-0.5736) ≈ -570 * 0.5736 ≈ -326.952. Therefore, the original formula is DF² = 586 - (-326.952) = 586 + 326.952 = 912.952. Correct.

So sqrt(912.952) ≈ 30.215, which rounds to 30.2 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Hence, answer B is 30.2.

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 30.2. So that's the answer. Let me check if any other options could be close. Option D is 912.9, which is DF squared, but they ask for x, which is DF. So D is wrong. The others: A is 15.1, which is too small. C is 60.4, which is larger than 30.2. So B makes sense.

Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe using the Law of Cosines with more accurate cosine value.

Suppose I use a calculator to find cos(125°). Let me check with actual calculation.

Using calculator input: 125 degrees. cos(125°) ≈ cos(π - 55°) = -cos(55°). Now, cos(55°) is approximately 0.5736. So indeed, cos(125°) ≈ -0.5736. Thus, previous steps hold.

Hence, DF² ≈ 912.95, so DF ≈ √912.95 ≈ 30.215, which rounds to 30.2. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the unknown side $ DF $ in triangle $ \triangle DGF $, we apply the **Law of Cosines**, which is particularly useful when we know two sides and the included angle. Here’s the structured solution:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Information**

We are given:

- Side $ DG = 15 $
- Side $ GF = 19 $
- Included Angle $ \angle DGF = 125^\circ $
- We are asked to find the length of side $ DF $

This fits the scenario where the **Law of Cosines** applies.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Law of Cosines Formula**

The Law of Cosines states:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(\theta)
$$

Here,
- $ a = DG = 15 $
- $ b = GF = 19 $
- $ \theta = \angle DGF = 125^\circ $
- $ c = DF $, the side opposite the angle

So,

$$
DF^2 = 15^2 + 19^2 - 2 \cdot 15 \cdot 19 \cdot \cos(125^\circ)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Perform Calculations Step-by-Step**

#### **Compute Squares of Sides:**
$$
15^2 = 225,\quad 19^2 = 361
$$
$$
\text{Sum} = 225 + 361 = 586
$$

#### **Compute Product Term:**
$$
2 \cdot 15 \cdot 19 = 570
$$

#### **Evaluate Cosine Value:**
$$
\cos(125^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ - 55^\circ) = -\cos(55^\circ) \approx -0.5736
$$

$$
570 \cdot (-0.5736) \approx -326.952
$$

#### **Apply to Formula:**
$$
DF^2 = 586 - (-326.952) = 586 + 326.952 = 912.952
$$

#### **Take Square Root:**
$$
DF = \sqrt{912.952} \approx 30.215
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final Result**

Rounded to the **nearest tenth**, we get:

$$
DF \approx 30.2
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The correct answer, based on the given data and application of the Law of Cosines, is:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

---

**Final Answer:** B
