MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, there's a circle with center A, right? Points B, C, D, E, F are all on this circle because they lie on Circle(A). That means AB, AC, AD, AE, AF are all radii of the circle. So, lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF are all radii, which implies that triangles ABC, ABD, etc., might have some properties.

Now, looking at the angles mentioned. The measure of angle CAD is given as 67 degrees. Then there's angle FAD which is a right angle (90 degrees) and angle FAB which we need to find, called x. Also, there's a sum of these three angles: angle CAD + angle FAD + angle FAB equals 180 degrees. Let me write that down:

∠CAD = 67°  
∠FAD = 90°  
∠FAB = x  
Sum: 67° + 90° + x = 180°  

Wait, solving for x would give x = 180 - 67 - 90 = 23°. But let me check if there's more to it. Because maybe I'm missing something here. 

But hold on, maybe the angles aren't directly additive like that. Let me visualize the diagram. Since points B, C, D, E, F are on the circle centered at A, then each of those points is equidistant from A. So, lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF are all radii, so they're all equal length. Therefore, triangle ACD has two sides equal? Wait, no. If A is the center, then AC and AD are both radii, so triangle ACD is an isosceles triangle with AC=AD. Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠ADC. But wait, the angle given is ∠CAD, which is at point A between points C and D. So, ∠CAD is the central angle corresponding to arc CD. Similarly, angle FAD is 90°, so that's another central angle. And angle FAB is x, another central angle. 

Since the sum of these three angles is 180°, but why? Maybe they form a straight line? Or perhaps they are adjacent angles around point A?

Wait, let me think again. If you look at the points B, C, D, E, F on the circle around A. The lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF are all radii. So, the angles between these radii would correspond to the arcs between the points. For example, angle CAB is the angle between CA and BA, which would be the central angle between points C and B. Similarly, angle FAD is between FA and DA, which would be the central angle between F and D. 

But how do these angles relate? The key thing is that the total around point A should add up to 360°, since it's a full circle. However, the given equation says that ∠CAD + ∠FAD + ∠FAB = 180°, which suggests that these three angles are part of a triangle or some configuration adding up to 180. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are arranged such that when combined, they make a straight line. For instance, if angle CAD is between C and D, angle FAD is between F and D, and angle FAB is between F and B. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me draw a rough sketch mentally. Suppose point A is the center. Let me imagine placing points C and D somewhere on the circle. Then angle CAD is the central angle between them. Then angle FAD is 90°, meaning that from point F to D, the central angle is 90°. And angle FAB is x, so from F to B. 

If we consider that the sum of these three angles is 180°, then maybe they form a triangle? Like, if you take points C, D, F, and B in some way... Wait, perhaps considering the positions of the points. For example, suppose that angle CAD is 67°, angle FAD is 90°, and angle FAB is x. So starting from point A, moving from C to D is 67°, then from F to D is 90°, and from F to B is x. How do these angles connect?

Alternatively, maybe the three angles are parts of different triangles. Let me think about the specific relationships. Since angle FAD is a right angle, that tells us that the arc FD corresponds to 90°, so the arc FD is a quarter-circle. Similarly, angle CAD is 67°, so arc CD is 67°. Then angle FAB is x, so arc FB is x. Now, depending on the arrangement of the points, the arcs could add up in certain ways. 

But how does that relate to the sum being 180°? Perhaps if these arcs are connected in a way that their measures add up to a semicircle (180°)? For example, if arc CD (which is 67°), arc DF (which is 90°), and arc FB (which is x) together make up half the circle. Wait, but the entire circle is 360°, so half would be 180°. So, if 67 + 90 + x = 180, then x = 23. Which matches my initial thought. 

So that seems straightforward. But let me verify. If the points are arranged such that moving from C to D is 67°, then from D to F is 90°, and from F back to B is x, and the total of these arcs adds up to 180°, then yes, that gives x = 23. 

But I need to make sure that these arcs are indeed consecutive. Are points C, D, F, and B placed in order around the circle such that arc CD + arc DF + arc FB equals half the circle? It depends on the positioning. However, the problem states that all points are on the circle, but doesn't specify their order. However, given that angle FAD is a right angle, that would mean that points F and D are separated by 90°, and angle CAD is 67°, so points C and D are separated by 67°. If we assume that points are ordered such that moving from C to D to F to B, then the arcs would add up accordingly. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another relationship. For example, since AB, AC, AD, AE, AF are all radii, then the angles between them are central angles. So, the measure of each angle between two radii is equal to the measure of the arc between those two points. 

Therefore, ∠CAD = arc CD = 67°, ∠FAD = arc FD = 90°, and ∠FAB = arc FB = x. Now, if those arcs are adjacent, then the total arc from C to D to F to B would be 67 + 90 + x. But unless there's a reason why that total arc is 180°, which would imply that these arcs are forming a semicircle. 

However, without knowing the exact positions of the points, it's possible that the arcs don't necessarily add up to 180°. But according to the problem statement, there's an equation given: SumOf(∠CAD, ∠FAD, ∠FAB) = 180°, so regardless of the actual positions, this sum is given as 180°. Therefore, even if the arcs weren't consecutive, the problem states that the sum of these three angles is 180°, so mathematically, that would mean 67 + 90 + x = 180 → x = 23. 

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 23. So, that seems to be the answer. However, I need to make sure there isn't another approach where the answer differs. Let me check again. 

Another possibility: Could these angles be related via triangle properties? For example, if triangle AFD is a right triangle because ∠FAD is 90°, then maybe using Pythagoras? But since all points are on the circle with center A, AF and AD are radii, so AF = AD. Thus, triangle AFD is an isosceles right-angled triangle. Therefore, angles at F and D would be 45°, but that's not directly related to our problem. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the other angles. The angle ∠FAB is x, and ∠CAD is 67°. If points B and C are positioned such that angle CAB is something. Wait, but how do these angles relate? 

But the main clue is the given equation that the sum of those three angles is 180°, so solving directly gives x = 23. Unless there's a miscalculation here. Let me re-calculate: 67 + 90 = 157, 180 - 157 = 23. Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be A. 23.
