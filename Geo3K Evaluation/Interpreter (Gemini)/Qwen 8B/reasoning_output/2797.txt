MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several points and lines with some constraints. The question is asking for the length of RW, given that RL is 5, RT is 9, and WS is 6. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, there are points R, L, T, W, S. Lines connecting them include RL, LW, RW, RT, TS, RS, and also LW again (maybe a typo? Or maybe it's just repeating). Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(R,L,W) and Triangle(R,T,S). They're similar. Also, some parallel lines: Line(LW) is parallel to Line(TS). And some points lying on lines, like W lies on line RS. 

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points R, L, W forming triangle RLW, and points R, T, S forming triangle RTS. These two triangles are similar. Since they are similar, their corresponding sides should be proportional. Also, since LW is parallel to TS, maybe there's something about corresponding angles or similar triangles here.

Given that RL = 5, RT = 9, WS = 6. Need to find RW. Wait, but WS is part of the second triangle? Let me think.

Since Triangle(R,L,W) ~ Triangle(R,T,S), the order of the vertices matters for similarity. So, corresponding sides would be RL corresponds to RT, LW corresponds to TS, and RW corresponds to RS? Wait, need to make sure which sides correspond.

In similar triangles, the order of the letters indicates correspondence. So Triangle(R,L,W) ~ Triangle(R,T,S). Therefore:

- Vertex R corresponds to R
- Vertex L corresponds to T
- Vertex W corresponds to S

So the sides opposite these vertices would correspond. Wait, but perhaps I should consider the sides as per the order. So side RL in Triangle(R,L,W) corresponds to side RT in Triangle(R,T,S). Then side LW corresponds to TS, and side RW corresponds to RS.

Wait, but let me check. If the triangles are similar in the order R-L-W ~ R-T-S, then the sides RL corresponds to RT, LW corresponds to TS, and RW corresponds to RS. Because each vertex in the first triangle corresponds to the same position in the second triangle. So:

RL (side between R and L) corresponds to RT (side between R and T).

LW (side between L and W) corresponds to TS (side between T and S).

RW (side between R and W) corresponds to RS (side between R and S).

Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be RL / RT = LW / TS = RW / RS.

We know RL is 5, RT is 9. So the ratio of similarity is 5/9. That means LW / TS = 5/9, and RW / RS = 5/9.

But wait, we also know that LW is parallel to TS. Which might mean that the triangles are similar because of AA similarity (since parallel lines create equal angles). But maybe we can use the ratios directly.

Additionally, there's a point W lying on line RS. Wait, Point W lies on Line(R,S)? Wait, the constraint says "PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(R,S))". So point W is on line RS. So that suggests that W is somewhere along RS. Hmm. So line RS connects points R and S, and W is on that line. So that might affect the lengths.

Also, given that WS = 6. Since W is on RS, then RS is divided into RW and WS. So RS = RW + WS. Since WS is 6, then RS = RW + 6. 

Now, going back to the similar triangles. From earlier, the ratio of similarity is 5/9. So RW / RS = 5/9. Let me write that equation:

RW / RS = 5 / 9

But RS = RW + 6. Substitute that into the equation:

RW / (RW + 6) = 5 / 9

Cross-multiplying gives:

9 * RW = 5 * (RW + 6)

Expanding right side:

9RW = 5RW + 30

Subtract 5RW both sides:

4RW = 30

Divide both sides by 4:

RW = 30 / 4 = 7.5

Wait, so RW would be 7.5. Looking at the answer choices, D is 7.5. So that seems straightforward. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, but why does the ratio hold? Because the triangles are similar, so the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. However, I assumed that RW corresponds to RS. Let me confirm the correspondence again.

Original triangles: Triangle(R,L,W) ~ Triangle(R,T,S). So the correspondence is R→R, L→T, W→S. Therefore:

- Side RL in Triangle(R,L,W) corresponds to side RT in Triangle(R,T,S). Hence RL / RT = 5 / 9.

- Side LW corresponds to TS. So LW / TS = 5 / 9.

- Side RW corresponds to RS. So RW / RS = 5 / 9.

Yes, that seems correct. So using that ratio, and knowing that RS = RW + WS = RW + 6, leads us to RW = 7.5. So answer D. 

But wait, another thought: Is there any possibility that the correspondence is different? For example, could it be that Triangle(R,L,W) ~ Triangle(R,S,T) instead? But the original statement says Triangle(R,T,S), so the order is important. So the correspondence is based on the order of the vertices. So R corresponds to R, L to T, W to S. So yes, the third side of the first triangle is RW, which corresponds to the third side of the second triangle, which is RS. Therefore, RW corresponds to RS. 

Another thing to verify: Are there any other constraints that could affect this? For instance, the fact that LW is parallel to TS. Well, since the triangles are similar, that's already implied by the similarity. Because if two triangles are similar, then corresponding angles are equal, hence the lines LW and TS being parallel would be consistent with the similarity. So that checks out. 

Alternatively, if we didn't know the triangles were similar, the parallel lines would imply that the triangles are similar via AA similarity. Since LW || TS, angle at R is common, so the triangles would be similar. So that confirms the similarity. 

So the key steps are:

1. Use the similarity ratio between the triangles.

2. Express RS in terms of RW and WS.

3. Solve the proportion to find RW.

Thus, RW = 7.5, which is option D. 

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. Let me double-check the algebra:

From RW/(RW + 6) = 5/9

Multiply both sides by (RW + 6):

RW = (5/9)(RW + 6)

Multiply both sides by 9:

9RW = 5RW + 30

Subtract 5RW:

4RW = 30 => RW = 30/4 = 7.5. Yep.

So the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ RW $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships described in the problem. We’re told that two triangles, $ \triangle RLT $ and $ \triangle RWS $, are **similar** (with the correspondence $ \triangle(R,L,W) \sim \triangle(R,T,S) $), and that certain segments lie on specific lines. Additionally, specific segment lengths are given:

- $ RL = 5 $
- $ RT = 9 $
- $ WS = 6 $

---

### Step 1: Understand Similar Triangles and Corresponding Sides

The notation $ \triangle(R,L,W) \sim \triangle(R,T,S) $ implies a direct correspondence of vertices:

- $ R \leftrightarrow R $
- $ L \leftrightarrow T $
- $ W \leftrightarrow S $

This tells us the corresponding sides of the triangles are:

- $ RL \leftrightarrow RT $
- $ LW \leftrightarrow TS $
- $ RW \leftrightarrow RS $

From this, we derive the **ratio of similarity**:

$$
\frac{RL}{RT} = \frac{LW}{TS} = \frac{RW}{RS}
$$

Given $ RL = 5 $ and $ RT = 9 $, the similarity ratio is:

$$
\frac{5}{9}
$$

Hence,

$$
\frac{RW}{RS} = \frac{5}{9}
$$

---

### Step 2: Express $ RS $ in Terms of $ RW $

We are told that point $ W $ lies on line $ RS $. This means that:

$$
RS = RW + WS
$$

And since $ WS = 6 $, we substitute:

$$
RS = RW + 6
$$

---

### Step 3: Set Up and Solve the Proportion

Using the similarity ratio:

$$
\frac{RW}{RW + 6} = \frac{5}{9}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
9RW = 5(RW + 6)
$$

Expand and simplify:

$$
9RW = 5RW + 30
$$

Subtract $ 5RW $ from both sides:

$$
4RW = 30
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
RW = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
$$

---

### Final Answer

The length of $ RW $ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{7.5}
$$

Which matches **Option D**.

Final Answer: D
