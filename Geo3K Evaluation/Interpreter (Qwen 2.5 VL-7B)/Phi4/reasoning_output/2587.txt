### Thought Section:

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are provided with several angles: \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), \(\angle C\), \(\angle D\), \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\).
- The conditions given are:
  - \(\text{Measure}(\angle A) = \text{Measure}(\angle B) = \text{Measure}(\angle C)\).

**Step 2: Summarize the Findings**
- The equality of the measures of \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), and \(\angle C\) suggests that these angles are likely part of a geometric configuration where they are equal, such as an equilateral triangle or an isosceles triangle.
- The goal is to find the measure of \(\angle 2\).

**Step 3: Brainstorm and Explore Possible Configurations**
- Consider the possibility of a triangle where \(\angle A = \angle B = \angle C\). In such a case, each angle in an equilateral triangle would be \(60^\circ\).
- If \(\angle D\), \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\) are part of another geometric configuration, we need to explore how they relate to \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), and \(\angle C\).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- If \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), and \(\angle C\) are part of an equilateral triangle, then each is \(60^\circ\).
- Consider the possibility of additional angles forming a linear pair or being part of another triangle.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine the Current Steps**
- Check if \(\angle 2\) could be part of a linear pair or supplementary angles with any of the given angles.
- Consider if \(\angle 2\) is part of a triangle with \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\).

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**
- Reassess the configuration: If \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), and \(\angle C\) are equal, and if \(\angle 2\) is related to these, it might be part of a supplementary or complementary relationship.

**Step 7: Calculate and Compare**
- Assume \(\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = 60^\circ\).
- If \(\angle 2\) is supplementary to one of these angles, then \(\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ\).
- If \(\angle 2\) is part of another triangle or configuration, consider other relationships.

**Step 8: Final Calculation**
- Given the choices, \(49^\circ\), \(55^\circ\), \(57^\circ\), and \(76^\circ\), none match \(120^\circ\).
- Re-evaluate if \(\angle 2\) could be part of a different configuration, such as an isosceles triangle or another geometric setup.
- Consider if \(\angle 2\) could be part of a triangle with angles summing to \(180^\circ\).

**Step 9: Determine the Closest Match**
- If \(\angle 2\) is part of a triangle with \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\), and if \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\), explore possible values.
- Assume \(\angle 1 = \angle 3 = 60^\circ\) (as part of an equilateral setup), then \(\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 60^\circ = 60^\circ\).
- Reassess if \(\angle 2\) could be part of a different configuration leading to one of the given choices.

**Step 10: Final Decision**
- Given the constraints and possible configurations, the closest logical conclusion is that \(\angle 2\) could be part of a configuration leading to \(57^\circ\) as a possible measure, considering typical angle relationships and the given choices.

<Solution>

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis, the measure of \(\angle 2\) is most likely derived from a configuration where it is part of a triangle or supplementary relationship with the given equal angles. The closest match to the calculated possibilities, considering typical geometric configurations and the given choices, is \(57^\circ\).
