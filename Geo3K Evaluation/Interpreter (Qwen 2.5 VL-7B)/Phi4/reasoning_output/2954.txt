1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We are given geometric constraints involving a circle and several points and lines. The lines connect points A, B, C, and D in sequence.
   - The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) is identified as a chord of the circle, and we have points A, B, C, and D on the circle, implying a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \).
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \), but it is unclear which specific angle this refers to without additional information. Typically, problems like this involve angles formed by chords, secants, or tangents.

2. **Identify Relevant Geometric Properties**:
   - Since \( \overline{AB} \) is a chord and \( A, B, C, D \) are points on the circle, quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is cyclic.
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
   - If \( \angle 2 \) refers to an angle subtended by a chord or an angle at the circumference, we might use the Inscribed Angle Theorem or properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

3. **Assumptions and Exploration**:
   - Assume \( \angle 2 \) is one of the angles in the cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \).
   - Without loss of generality, let's assume \( \angle 2 \) is \( \angle ABC \).
   - If \( \angle ABC \) is subtended by arc \( AC \), then \( \angle ADC \) (opposite angle) is subtended by the same arc and they are supplementary.

4. **Applying Theorems**:
   - Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem: An angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended at the center.
   - If \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ADC \) are supplementary, then \( \angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \).

5. **Calculating Possible Values**:
   - Consider common angles in cyclic quadrilaterals or regular polygons inscribed in a circle.
   - If \( ABCD \) were a square or a rectangle, \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
   - If \( ABCD \) were a regular hexagon, each angle would be \( 120^\circ \), but this doesn't fit the options.
   - If \( ABCD \) were an equilateral triangle (though not possible with four points), angles would be \( 60^\circ \).

6. **Verification and Refinement**:
   - Given the options, \( 30^\circ, 45^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ \), and considering typical cyclic quadrilateral configurations, \( 90^\circ \) is a common angle in right-angled triangles or rectangles inscribed in circles.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Without specific information about the exact configuration of points, the most reasonable assumption is that \( \angle 2 \) is \( 90^\circ \), which is a common angle in cyclic quadrilaterals when they form right angles.

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and typical configurations of cyclic quadrilaterals, the most plausible measure for \( \angle 2 \) is \( 90^\circ \), assuming it is an angle in a rectangle or right-angled triangle inscribed in the circle. This aligns with common geometric properties and the given answer choices.
