1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have a circle denoted as \(\odot F\).
   - Points A, B, C, D, and E are on or related to this circle.
   - Several lines are mentioned: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CF\), \(DF\), and \(EF\).
   - Angles are specified: \(\angle AFD = 50^\circ\) and \(\angle CFB\) is a right angle.
   - Arc \(ACE\) is mentioned, and we need to find its measure.

2. **Summarize key information:**
   - \(CF \perp FB\) implies \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\).
   - \(F\) is the center of the circle (since it's denoted as \(\odot F\)).
   - \(A\), \(C\), and \(E\) are points on the circle, forming the arc \(ACE\).
   - \(\angle AFD = 50^\circ\) is given, and since \(F\) is the center, this is a central angle.

3. **Apply geometric theorems and properties:**
   - The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, \(\angle AFD = 50^\circ\) implies that the arc \(AD\) measures \(50^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\), and \(F\) is the center, \(CB\) is a diameter of the circle. Thus, arc \(CB\) measures \(180^\circ\).

4. **Determine the measure of arc \(ACE\):**
   - Arc \(ACE\) can be broken down into arcs \(AC\), \(CE\), and \(EA\).
   - Since \(CB\) is a diameter, arc \(CB\) is \(180^\circ\).
   - Arc \(AD\) is \(50^\circ\), and since \(D\) is on the circle, arc \(DF\) is \(50^\circ\) as well.
   - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\). Therefore, arc \(ACE\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     m\widehat{ACE} = 360^\circ - m\widehat{CB} - m\widehat{AD}
     \]
     \[
     m\widehat{ACE} = 360^\circ - 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
     \]

5. **Reassess and verify calculations:**
   - Check if any additional information affects the calculation. The only other given angle is \(\angle AFD = 50^\circ\), which we have used correctly.
   - Consider if there are any other arcs or angles that need to be accounted for. Since \(CB\) is a diameter, no additional arcs are needed.

6. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - The calculated measure of arc \(ACE\) is \(130^\circ\), which is not directly listed.
   - The closest option to \(130^\circ\) is \(115^\circ\).

7. **Select the closest answer:**
   - Based on the calculations and the given choices, the closest answer to \(130^\circ\) is \(115^\circ\).
