### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints
We are given that Triangle(A, B, C) has all sides of equal length, meaning it is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the lengths of Line(A, B), Line(B, C), and Line(A, C) are all equal.

### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings
The sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle is given as:
\[ \text{LengthOf(Line(A,B))} + \text{LengthOf(Line(B,C))} + \text{LengthOf(Line(A,C))} = 3482 \text{ miles} \]

Since it's an equilateral triangle:
\[ 3 \times \text{LengthOf(Line(A,B))} = 3482 \]

### Step 3: Solve for the Length of One Side
Let \( x \) be the length of each side of the triangle:
\[ 3x = 3482 \]
\[ x = \frac{3482}{3} \]
\[ x = 1160.6667 \]

### Step 4: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which corresponds to one side of the triangle, \( x \).

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated length of one side is approximately 1160.67 miles. We need to compare this with the given answer choices:
- A. 53
- B. 73.8
- C. 110
- D. 1591

The closest answer choice to 1160.67 is D. 1591.

### Step 6: Verify and Reflect
Reassess the calculations and the logic:
- The problem is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.
- The calculated side length is accurate based on the given total perimeter.
- The closest match to the calculated side length is indeed option D.

### Step 7: Finalize the Solution
Based on the analysis and calculations, the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is closest to 1591 miles.

**Solution:**
1. Recognize that the triangle is equilateral with equal side lengths.
2. Use the equation \( 3x = 3482 \) to find the length of one side.
3. Calculate \( x = \frac{3482}{3} = 1160.6667 \).
4. Compare this value to the answer choices and find the closest match.
5. The closest value to 1160.67 is 1591.

Final Answer: D
