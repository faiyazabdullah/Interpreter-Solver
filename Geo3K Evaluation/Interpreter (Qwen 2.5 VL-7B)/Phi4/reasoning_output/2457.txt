**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and understand the problem**

- We are given a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC \) as the right angle.
- The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal in length, indicating that the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.
- The hypotenuse of the triangle is \( AC \).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

- We need to use a Pythagorean Triple to find the length of \( x \), which is likely one of the sides of the triangle.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and formulas**

- For a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse.
- Given \( AB = BC = x \) and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, the equation becomes:
  \[
  x^2 + x^2 = AC^2
  \]
  \[
  2x^2 = AC^2
  \]
  \[
  x^2 = \frac{AC^2}{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Consider Pythagorean Triples**

- Common Pythagorean Triples include (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), etc.
- Since \( AB = BC \), we need a Pythagorean Triple where two sides are equal, which suggests using multiples of (1, 1, \(\sqrt{2}\)) scaled up.

**Step 5: Calculate using a suitable Pythagorean Triple**

- Consider the triple (7, 7, 7\(\sqrt{2}\)), which is a scaled version of (1, 1, \(\sqrt{2}\)).
- Here, \( x = 7k \) and \( AC = 7\sqrt{2}k \).

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \) using the equation**

- Substitute \( AC = 7\sqrt{2}k \) into the equation:
  \[
  2x^2 = (7\sqrt{2}k)^2
  \]
  \[
  2(7k)^2 = 98k^2
  \]
  \[
  49k^2 = 49k^2
  \]
  - This confirms the relationship holds.

- To find \( x \), choose \( k \) such that \( AC \) is an integer:
  - Let \( AC = 98 \) (since \( 7\sqrt{2}k = 98 \), \( k = 7 \)).
  - Then \( x = 7k = 49 \).

**Step 7: Check for the closest answer choice**

- Since \( x = 49 \), we need to find the closest answer choice.
- The closest option to 49 is 48, which corresponds to the triple (48, 48, 48\(\sqrt{2}\)).
- Recalculate using this triple:
  \[
  AC = 48\sqrt{2} \approx 67.88
  \]
  - This rounds to 68.

**Step 8: Select the closest answer choice**

- The closest answer choice to the calculated \( AC \approx 67.88 \) is 68.

**Step 9: Finalize the solution**

- Based on the calculations and the closest match, the answer is 68.

**Solution:**

Using the properties of an isosceles right triangle and Pythagorean triples, we determined that the closest match for the hypotenuse length is 68. Therefore, the correct answer is:
