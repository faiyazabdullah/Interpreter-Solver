### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a parallelogram \( MNP R \).
   - Given: \( \angle MNP \) and \( \angle NRP \) are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and opposite angles are equal.
   - The properties of a parallelogram state that consecutive angles are supplementary.

2. **Understanding What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle MNP \).

3. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - \( \angle MNP = 90^\circ \) is given directly.
   - Since \( \angle NRP \) is also \(90^\circ\), and \( MNP R \) is a parallelogram, we know that \( MP \parallel NR \) and \( MN \parallel PR \).

4. **Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( \angle MNP = 90^\circ \), and \( MNP R \) is a parallelogram, we need to consider the implications.
   - In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, \( \angle MNP + \angle NRP = 180^\circ \).
   - Given \( \angle MNP = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle NRP = 90^\circ \), this condition is satisfied.

5. **Verification and Reassessment:**
   - The problem states that \( \angle MNP \) and \( \angle NRP \) are right angles, which are already given as \(90^\circ\).
   - The problem also states that the lengths of certain sides are equal, but this does not affect the angle measures directly.

6. **Reflection and Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \( \angle MNP \) is directly given as \(90^\circ\).
   - None of the answer choices match \(90^\circ\) exactly, so we need to select the closest value.

7. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are: A. 33, B. 38, C. 71, D. 109.
   - The closest value to \(90^\circ\) is D. 109.

</think>

### Solution
The measure of \( \angle MNP \) is \(90^\circ\). Among the given answer choices, the closest value to \(90^\circ\) is 109. Therefore, the correct answer is:
