1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**  
   - We have two lines, Line(A) and Line(E), which are parallel (\(a \parallel b\)).
   - Two angles are given: \(\angle(A, B, E, G, H)\) and \(\angle(A, B, E, F, G, H)\).
   - The measures of these angles are equal: \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle(A, B, E, G, H)) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle(A, B, E, F, G, H))\).

2. **Understand the problem statement:**  
   - The task is to solve for \(x\) in the equation \(4x + 11 = 8x + 1\).
   - The goal is to find \(x\) such that the angles are equal, which is consistent with the lines being parallel.

3. **Identify relevant geometric properties:**  
   - When two lines are parallel, corresponding angles are equal. This is consistent with the given condition that the measures of the angles are equal.

4. **Solve the equation \(4x + 11 = 8x + 1\):**  
   - Start by simplifying the equation:
     \[
     4x + 11 = 8x + 1
     \]
   - Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
     \[
     11 = 4x + 1
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     10 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**  
   - Check the calculations:
     - \(4x + 11 = 4(2.5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21\)
     - \(8x + 1 = 8(2.5) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\)
   - Both sides are equal, confirming \(x = 2.5\) is correct.

6. **Compare with answer choices:**  
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is 2.5, which matches choice A.

7. **Select the correct answer choice:**  
   - Based on the calculations, the closest and correct choice is A. 2.5.

<Solution>
To solve the equation \(4x + 11 = 8x + 1\), we performed the following steps:

1. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4x + 11 = 8x + 1
   \]
2. Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
   \[
   11 = 4x + 1
   \]
3. Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   10 = 4x
   \]
4. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
   \]

The calculated value of \(x\) is 2.5, which corresponds to choice A. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
