**Step 1: Analyze the given information.**

- We have a trapezoid \(GHJK\) where \(GH\) and \(JK\) are the bases.
- The lengths of the bases \(GH\) and \(JK\) are equal.
- The area of trapezoid \(GHJK\) is given as 75 square meters.
- We need to find the height of the trapezoid.

**Step 2: Summarize relevant geometric formulas.**

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]

Where:
- \(\text{Base}_1\) and \(\text{Base}_2\) are the lengths of the parallel sides (bases).
- \(\text{Height}\) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.

**Step 3: Analyze the constraints and information.**

- We know the area is 75 square meters.
- \(GH = JK\), and their sum is given by:
  \[
  GH + JK = 17 + 13 = 30
  \]
- Since \(GH = JK\), let \(GH = JK = x\).
- Therefore, \(x + x = 30\) implies \(2x = 30\), so \(x = 15\).

**Step 4: Set up the equation using the area formula.**

Substitute the known values into the area formula:
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (15 + 15) \times \text{Height}
\]
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times \text{Height}
\]
\[
75 = 15 \times \text{Height}
\]

**Step 5: Solve for the height.**

Divide both sides by 15 to find the height:
\[
\text{Height} = \frac{75}{15} = 5
\]

**Step 6: Compare the calculated height with the answer choices.**

- The calculated height is 5, which matches choice C.

**Step 7: Reassess and verify the calculations.**

- Rechecking the calculations confirms that all steps are consistent and correct.
- The calculations align with the given constraints and formulas.

**Step 8: Finalize the solution.**

Based on the calculations and the given answer choices, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C**

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the trapezoid \(GHJK\) with bases \(GH = JK\) and an area of 75 square meters, we found that the lengths of the bases are each 15 meters. Using the area formula for a trapezoid, we calculated the height to be 5 meters. Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
