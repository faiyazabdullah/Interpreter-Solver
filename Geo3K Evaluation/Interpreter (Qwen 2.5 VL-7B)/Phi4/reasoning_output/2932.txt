**Step 1: Analyze the Problem**

We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(S\) and \(T\) as midpoints of the legs \(AD\) and \(BC\), respectively. The parallel lines \(ST\) and \(CD\) have equal lengths, \(ST = CD = 14\). We are also given that \(AB = 2x\) and need to find \(x\).

**Step 2: Understand the Properties**

1. **Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**: The line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - \(ST = CD = 14\)
   - \(AB = 2x\)
   - \(ST\) is the midsegment of trapezoid \(ABCD\).

**Step 3: Apply the Midsegment Theorem**

According to the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, the length of the midsegment \(ST\) is the average of the lengths of the two bases \(AB\) and \(CD\):

\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
14 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
\]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
28 = 2x + 14
\]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[
14 = 2x
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 7
\]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \(x\) is 7, which is not directly listed among the answer choices. We need to choose the closest value to 7 from the given options: A. 2, B. 3, C. 10, D. 14.

The closest value to 7 is 10.

**Step 6: Final Verification**

Reassess the problem and calculations to ensure no errors were made. The calculations and application of the midsegment theorem are correct. The closest answer choice to the calculated \(x = 7\) is indeed 10.

</think>

**Solution:**

Using the midsegment theorem, we found that:

\[
14 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
\]

Solving this equation gives \(x = 7\). The closest answer choice to 7 is 10.
