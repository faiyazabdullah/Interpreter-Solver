**Thought Section**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a regular polygon \(ABCDEFG\) with 7 sides (heptagon) and a center point \(O\). Lines connect each vertex of the polygon to \(O\), forming triangles. We need to find the area of the shaded region, which is typically the area of the polygon.

2. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The polygon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal.
   - The radius of the circumscribed circle is given as \(RadiusOf(Circle(O))\).

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of the regular heptagon \(ABCDEFG\).

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Formulas:**
   - For a regular polygon with \(n\) sides and a circumradius \(R\), the area \(A\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} n R^2 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)
     \]
   - Here, \(n = 7\) for a heptagon.

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Substitute \(n = 7\) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times R^2 \times \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right)
     \]
   - We need the value of \(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right)\). Using a calculator:
     \[
     \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right) \approx 0.7818
     \]
   - Substitute this value into the area formula:
     \[
     A \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times R^2 \times 0.7818
     \]
     \[
     A \approx 2.7363 \times R^2
     \]

6. **Determine the Radius \(R\):**
   - The problem states \(RadiusOf(Circle(O))\), but does not provide a numerical value. Assume \(R = 10\) for calculation purposes (a common assumption if not specified).

7. **Calculate the Area with Assumed Radius:**
   - Substitute \(R = 10\):
     \[
     A \approx 2.7363 \times 10^2 = 2.7363 \times 100 = 273.63
     \]

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area \(273.63\) is closest to option B: \(282.9\).

9. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Ensure all steps and assumptions are correct. The assumption of \(R = 10\) is reasonable given no specific radius was provided.

10. **Finalize the Answer:**
    - Based on the calculations and comparison, the closest answer choice is B.

</think>

**Solution Section**

Given the regular heptagon \(ABCDEFG\) with a circumradius \(R\), the area is calculated using the formula for the area of a regular polygon. Assuming \(R = 10\) (a reasonable assumption without specific radius), the area is approximately \(273.63\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \(282.9\).

Final Answer: B
