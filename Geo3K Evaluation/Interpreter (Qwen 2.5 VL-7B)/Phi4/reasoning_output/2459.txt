**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- **Rectangle \(JKLM\)**: This means that all angles in the rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)), and opposite sides are equal.
- **Rhombus \(MLPR\)**: This implies all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.
- Given angles: \(\angle JMK = \angle RMP\) and both are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- \(\angle JMK = 55^\circ\) is given, but since it's also stated that \(\angle JMK\) is a right angle, there seems to be a contradiction. However, we interpret that \(\angle JMK\) is part of the rectangle's right angle, meaning the other part of the right angle at \(M\) is \(35^\circ\) (since \(90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ\)).
- \(\angle RMP = 70^\circ\) is given.
- Since \(\angle JMK \cong \angle RMP\), and both are right angles, the \(55^\circ\) given for \(\angle JMK\) is the measure of the angle adjacent to the right angle in the rectangle.

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**

- We need to find \(m \angle KLP\).
- Consider the properties of the rhombus and rectangle. Since \(MLPR\) is a rhombus, \(\angle MLP = \angle MRP\).
- Use the fact that \(\angle RMP = 70^\circ\) to find \(\angle MLP\).

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps**

- In \(\triangle MRP\), since it is part of the rhombus, \(\angle MRP = \angle MLP\).
- The sum of angles in \(\triangle MRP\) is \(180^\circ\).
- \(\angle RMP = 70^\circ\), and \(\angle MRP = \angle MLP\).

**Step 5: Calculate \(\angle MLP\)**

\[
\angle MRP + \angle MLP + \angle RMP = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle MLP + \angle MLP + 70^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
2\angle MLP = 110^\circ
\]
\[
\angle MLP = 55^\circ
\]

**Step 6: Find \(m \angle KLP\)**

- In \(\triangle KLP\), we know:
  - \(\angle KLM = 90^\circ\) (since \(JKLM\) is a rectangle).
  - \(\angle MLP = 55^\circ\).
- Use the angle sum property in \(\triangle KLP\):

\[
\angle KLP + \angle KLM + \angle MLP = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle KLP + 90^\circ + 55^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle KLP + 145^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle KLP = 35^\circ
\]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(m \angle KLP = 35^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice is \(20^\circ\).

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest answer choice to \(35^\circ\) is \(20^\circ\).

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the calculations and analysis, the measure of \(\angle KLP\) is \(35^\circ\), and the closest answer choice is \(20^\circ\).
