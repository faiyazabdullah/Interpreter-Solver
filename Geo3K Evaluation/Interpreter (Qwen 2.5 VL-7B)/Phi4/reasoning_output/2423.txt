1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have an isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) where \( AB \cong BC \). This means the lengths of sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( AB \).

3. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - Since \( AB = BC \), the problem is essentially asking for the length of one of these equal sides.

4. **Consider Geometric Properties:**
   - In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are opposite the equal angles. However, no specific angles or other side lengths are given, so we cannot use trigonometric identities or the Pythagorean theorem directly.

5. **Explore Possible Solutions:**
   - Without additional information such as angles or the length of the third side \( AC \), we cannot determine a unique numerical value for \( AB \) using geometric properties alone.
   - The problem might be testing recognition of the fact that without additional information, the length of \( AB \) cannot be uniquely determined.

6. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - Since no specific numerical values or additional constraints are provided, the problem might be designed to select the closest or most reasonable choice from the given options based on typical scenarios or assumptions.

7. **Reflect on the Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are numerical values: 3, 4, 7, and 11.
   - Without loss of generality, if we assume a simple scenario where the triangle is not degenerate and the sides are of reasonable length, we might consider typical integer values for side lengths.

8. **Iterate and Choose the Closest Reasonable Answer:**
   - Given no specific constraints, we might assume a simple integer value for \( AB \) that is commonly used in problems involving integer side lengths.
   - Among the choices, 4 is a common integer length that might be assumed in many geometric problems involving simple integer side lengths.

<Solution>

Given the constraints and the lack of additional information, we cannot determine a unique value for \( AB \) using geometric properties alone. However, considering typical scenarios and common integer values used in geometric problems, the most reasonable assumption is that \( AB \) could be 4.

Final Answer: B
