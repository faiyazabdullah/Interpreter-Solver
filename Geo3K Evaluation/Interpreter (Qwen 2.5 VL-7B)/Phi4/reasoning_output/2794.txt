### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Problem:**
   - We are given two similar figures, a blue figure and a green figure.
   - We need to find the scale factor from the blue figure to the green figure using their areas.
   - The relationship between the areas of similar figures and their scale factor is given by the formula:
     \[
     \left(\text{Scale Factor}\right)^2 = \frac{\text{Area of Green Figure}}{\text{Area of Blue Figure}}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - Let \( A_{\text{blue}} \) be the area of the blue figure.
   - Let \( A_{\text{green}} \) be the area of the green figure.
   - We need to find the scale factor \( k \) such that:
     \[
     k^2 = \frac{A_{\text{green}}}{A_{\text{blue}}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( k \), we get:
     \[
     k = \sqrt{\frac{A_{\text{green}}}{A_{\text{blue}}}}
     \]

3. **Exploring the Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are: \( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{4}{1} \).
   - These choices represent possible values for \( k \).

4. **Applying the Formula:**
   - Assume \( A_{\text{blue}} = 1 \) (for simplicity, as the exact areas are not given, we assume a unit area for the blue figure).
   - Then, \( A_{\text{green}} = k^2 \).
   - We need to match \( k^2 \) with one of the answer choices squared.

5. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - If \( k = \frac{1}{4} \), then \( k^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} \).
   - If \( k = \frac{1}{2} \), then \( k^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - If \( k = \frac{2}{1} \), then \( k^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 = 4 \).
   - If \( k = \frac{4}{1} \), then \( k^2 = \left(\frac{4}{1}\right)^2 = 16 \).

6. **Selecting the Correct Answer:**
   - The correct \( k \) should match the ratio of the areas such that \( k^2 = \frac{A_{\text{green}}}{A_{\text{blue}}} \).
   - Since \( k^2 = 4 \) matches the scenario where the green figure is 4 times the area of the blue figure, \( k = 2 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The scale factor from the blue to the green figure is \( \frac{2}{1} \).

<Solution>

### Solution Section

Given the relationship between the areas of similar figures and their scale factor, we have determined that:

- The scale factor \( k \) is found using the formula:
  \[
  k = \sqrt{\frac{A_{\text{green}}}{A_{\text{blue}}}}
  \]
- By examining the possible values for \( k \) based on the given answer choices, we found that:
  - \( k = \frac{2}{1} \) results in \( k^2 = 4 \), which is consistent with the green figure being 4 times the area of the blue figure.

Thus, the correct scale factor from the blue figure to the green figure is \( \frac{2}{1} \).
