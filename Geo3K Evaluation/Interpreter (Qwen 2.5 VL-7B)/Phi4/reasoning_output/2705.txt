**Analyzing the Question:**
- We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\) and need to find a specific angle measure, denoted as \(y\), to ensure the quadrilateral remains a parallelogram.
- Key properties of a parallelogram include:
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to \(180^\circ\)).

**Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
- We need to determine the angle \(y\) that ensures \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, given specific angle measures for \(\angle B\), \(\angle D\), \(\angle A\), and \(\angle C\).

**Applying Geometric Theorems:**
- Let's assume:
  - \(\angle B = y\)
  - \(\angle D = 51^\circ\)
  - \(\angle A = 129^\circ\)
  - \(\angle C = y\)

- Using the property of consecutive angles being supplementary:
  \[
  \angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  129^\circ + y = 180^\circ
  \]

**Solving the Equation:**
- Solve for \(y\):
  \[
  y = 180^\circ - 129^\circ = 51^\circ
  \]

**Verification:**
- Check if \(\angle C = y\) and \(\angle D = 51^\circ\) satisfy the opposite angles property:
  - \(\angle B = \angle C = 51^\circ\)
  - \(\angle A = \angle D = 129^\circ\)

- Both conditions for a parallelogram are satisfied:
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary.

**Reassessing the Calculation:**
- The calculation \(y = 51^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of a parallelogram.
- The calculated value matches one of the answer choices.

**Reflecting and Iterating:**
- The steps taken align with the properties of a parallelogram.
- The calculations are correct, and the choice matches the given options.

**Conclusion:**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct value for \(y\) that ensures \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram is \(51^\circ\).

</think>

**Solution:**

To ensure that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, we used the properties that opposite angles are equal and consecutive angles are supplementary. By setting \(\angle A = 129^\circ\) and solving \(\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ\), we found \(y = 51^\circ\). This satisfies both the supplementary condition for consecutive angles and the equality condition for opposite angles. Therefore, the correct choice is:
