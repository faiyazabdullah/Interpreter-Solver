### Analysis of the Question

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: 
   - We have two right triangles, \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \).
   - Given that \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle DEF \) are right angles.
   - Several sides of these triangles are given as equal in length: 
     - \( BC = EF \)
     - \( AB = DF \)
   - We are also told that the sides are proportional in pairs: 
     - \( BC \propto EF \)
     - \( AB \propto DF \)
   - Finally, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 = 16 \) and select the closest answer from the choices.

2. **Summarize the Given Information**:
   - \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \) are right triangles.
   - \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle DEF \) are both right angles.
   - The side lengths are proportional and equal as specified: \( BC = EF \), \( AB = DF \).

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found**:
   - Solve for \( x \) where \( x^2 = 16 \).

4. **Apply Relevant Mathematical Theorems and Properties**:
   - Solving the equation \( x^2 = 16 \) involves finding the square roots of 16.
   - The square roots of 16 are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -4 \).

5. **Verification and Refinement**:
   - Since the problem asks to find \( x \) and select the closest answer from the choices, we focus on the positive root \( x = 4 \) as it aligns with typical mathematical conventions for positive lengths in geometry.
   - The answer choices are \( 3, 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \).

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value of \( x = 4 \) exactly matches choice B.

7. **Reassess and Reflect**:
   - The problem constraints and calculations align well with the solution.
   - The geometric constraints provided do not affect the algebraic solution for \( x \) since they are already accounted for in the equality and proportionality of side lengths.

8. **Final Conclusion**:
   - Based on the calculation and comparison with the answer choices, the correct answer is \( x = 4 \), which corresponds to choice B.

<Solution>

To solve the equation \( x^2 = 16 \), we take the square root of both sides:

\[
x = \pm \sqrt{16}
\]

This results in two possible solutions:

\[
x = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4
\]

Since we are typically interested in positive values for geometric lengths, we select \( x = 4 \).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 3
- B. 4
- C. 5
- D. 6

The calculated value \( x = 4 \) matches exactly with choice B.

Final Answer: B
