**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints.**
- We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the bases.
- The trapezoid has right angles at \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle DBC\), indicating \(AD\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular to the bases.
- \(AB \parallel CD\) because they are the bases of the trapezoid.
- \(AD\) is the height from \(D\) to base \(AB\), and \(BC\) is the height from \(B\) to base \(CD\).
- The lengths of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are equal.

**Step 2: Summarize the relevant geometric properties.**
- Given \(AB = CD = DA\), let this common length be \(x\).
- The height of the trapezoid is \(AD\) (or \(BC\) since \(AD = BC\)), which is also \(x\).
- The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
  \]
  where \(\text{Base}_1 = AB\), \(\text{Base}_2 = CD\), and \(\text{Height} = AD\).

**Step 3: Apply the area formula.**
- Substitute the known values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + x) \times x = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x \times x = x^2
  \]

**Step 4: Determine the value of \(x\).**
- Since \(AB = CD = DA = x\) and \(AD\) is the height, we need to find \(x\) such that the area matches one of the given choices.
- The area \(x^2\) must be one of the answer choices: 45, 90, 180, or 360.

**Step 5: Calculate possible values of \(x\).**
- Check each option:
  - If \(x^2 = 45\), then \(x = \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7\).
  - If \(x^2 = 90\), then \(x = \sqrt{90} \approx 9.5\).
  - If \(x^2 = 180\), then \(x = \sqrt{180} \approx 13.4\).
  - If \(x^2 = 360\), then \(x = \sqrt{360} \approx 18.97\).

**Step 6: Verify the most reasonable value.**
- Given the symmetry and equal lengths, \(x\) should be a simple integer.
- The closest integer value for \(x\) that fits well with the geometric constraints is when \(x^2 = 180\), giving \(x \approx 13.4\), which is reasonable for a geometric figure with equal sides and height.

**Step 7: Reassess and conclude.**
- The calculated area \(x^2 = 180\) is the most logical and fits the given constraints.
- Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is closest to 180.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the area of the trapezoid is \(x^2 = 180\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
