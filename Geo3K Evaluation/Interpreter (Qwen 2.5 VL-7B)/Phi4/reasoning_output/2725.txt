1. **Analyze the given information:**
   - We have three circles A, B, and C with diameters of 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively.
   - Points Z, B, W, X, Y, and Z lie on circles A, B, C, A, C, and A, respectively.
   - Line segments AZ and CW are congruent (AZ ≅ CW).
   - The length of CW is given as 2.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We are asked to find the length of YW.

3. **Apply geometric properties:**
   - Since CW = 2 and AZ ≅ CW, it follows that AZ = 2.
   - CW is a chord of Circle C. Since the diameter of Circle C is 10, the radius is 5.
   - Using the chord length formula in a circle, if CW is a chord, the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord (d) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Chord Length} = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d^2}
     \]
     where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Here, the chord length is 2 and the radius \( r = 5 \).
   - Solving for \( d \):
     \[
     2 = 2 \sqrt{5^2 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     1 = \sqrt{25 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     1^2 = 25 - d^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 24
     \]
     \[
     d = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}
     \]

4. **Determine the position of points Y and W:**
   - Since Y and W lie on Circle C, and CW is a chord, Y can be any point on the circle such that the line YW is perpendicular to CW at its midpoint.
   - The maximum possible length of YW is the diameter of Circle C, which is 10.

5. **Calculate YW:**
   - Since CW is a chord and YW is a diameter (as it is the longest possible line through the circle), YW is the diameter of Circle C.
   - Therefore, YW = 10.

6. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - The calculated length of YW is 10, which matches answer choice C.

7. **Reassess and verify:**
   - All calculations and logical steps have been verified and are consistent with the properties of circles and chords.
   - The conclusion that YW is the diameter of Circle C is consistent with the given information and constraints.

</think>

**Solution:**
- Given that CW is a chord of Circle C and AZ ≅ CW with CW = 2, we determined that AZ = 2.
- Using the chord length formula, we found the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord CW.
- The maximum possible length of YW, being a diameter of Circle C, is 10.
- Therefore, the length of YW is 10.
