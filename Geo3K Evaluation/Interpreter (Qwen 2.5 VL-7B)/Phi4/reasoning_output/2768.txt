1. **Analyze the Problem**: We are given the measures of two angles, \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\), in a geometric figure and need to determine the measure of \(\angle 4\). The given measures are \(m \angle 1 = 50^\circ\) and \(m \angle 3 = 60^\circ\).

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found**: We need to find \(m \angle 4\). To do so, we must understand the relationships between these angles. The problem does not specify the type of geometric figure, but the typical context for such problems involves parallel lines and a transversal or a triangle.

3. **Explore Possible Geometric Relationships**:
   - If the angles are part of a triangle, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
   - If the angles are part of a configuration involving parallel lines and a transversal, we might encounter alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, or supplementary angles.

4. **Consider a Triangle Scenario**:
   - If \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 3\), and \(\angle 4\) are angles of a triangle, then:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     50^\circ + 60^\circ + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     110^\circ + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]

5. **Consider a Parallel Lines and Transversal Scenario**:
   - If \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are angles on the same side of a transversal intersecting parallel lines, they would be supplementary:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 110^\circ
     \]
     However, this does not directly help with finding \(\angle 4\) unless \(\angle 4\) is related as an exterior or alternate interior angle.
   - If \(\angle 4\) is an exterior angle of a triangle where \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are interior angles, then:
     \[
     m \angle 4 = m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 50^\circ + 60^\circ = 110^\circ
     \]
     This scenario does not fit the answer choices.

6. **Verify Calculations and Scenarios**:
   - The triangle scenario calculation is consistent and matches one of the answer choices.
   - The parallel lines scenario does not provide a clear path to \(\angle 4\) without additional information.

7. **Reassess and Reflect**:
   - The triangle scenario is the most straightforward and matches the given answer choices.
   - The calculated measure of \(\angle 4\) is \(70^\circ\), which is option D.

8. **Finalize the Solution**:
   - Based on the triangle scenario, the measure of \(\angle 4\) is \(70^\circ\), which corresponds to answer choice D.

</think> 
"Solution section": Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and the application of the triangle angle sum property, the measure of \(\angle 4\) is found to be \(70^\circ\). This corresponds to option D. Therefore, the final answer is:
