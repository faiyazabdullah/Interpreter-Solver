**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- The problem states that we have a triangle \( \triangle RQS \) with points \( R \), \( Q \), and \( S \).
- The lines \( RQ \), \( QS \), and \( RS \) are the sides of the triangle.
- The lengths of these sides are equal: \( RQ = QS = RS \).
- This implies that \( \triangle RQS \) is an equilateral triangle, where all sides are equal and all interior angles are equal.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle R \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- In an equilateral triangle, all interior angles are equal.
- The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- Therefore, each angle in an equilateral triangle is \( \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \).

**Step 4: Verify Calculations and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \( \angle R \) is \( 60^\circ \).
- The given answer choices are:
  - A. 29.1
  - B. 43.7
  - C. 54.8
  - D. 56.1
- None of these choices exactly match \( 60^\circ \), but we need to select the closest one.

**Step 5: Select the Closest Answer**
- The closest value to \( 60^\circ \) among the choices is \( 56.1 \).

**Step 6: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the calculations and the closest match to \( 60^\circ \), the correct answer choice is \( D \).

**Solution:**

Given that \( \triangle RQS \) is an equilateral triangle, each angle measures \( 60^\circ \). Among the provided answer choices, the closest value to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 56.1 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
