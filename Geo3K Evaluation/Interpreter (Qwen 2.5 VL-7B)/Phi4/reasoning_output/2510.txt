**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
- The length of line \( BC \) is 5.4 units.
- Line \( JK \) is a diameter of circle \( J \).
- Line \( BC \) is a side of both triangles \( \triangle JKB \) and \( \triangle KJC \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find the length of \( JK \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( JK \) is a diameter of circle \( J \), the length of \( JK \) is twice the radius of circle \( J \).
- Therefore, \( JK = 2 \times 10 = 20 \) units.

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of the Current Steps**

- The calculation \( JK = 2 \times 10 = 20 \) is based on the property that the diameter of a circle is twice the radius.
- This is a direct application of the definition of a diameter, so it should be accurate.

**Step 5: Compare the Calculated Result with the Given Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of \( JK \) is 20 units.
- The closest answer choice to 20 is 20.6.

**Step 6: Reflect and Reassess**

- Reassess the problem constraints and calculations.
- Ensure no additional geometric relationships or constraints are overlooked.
- The problem states \( JK \) is the diameter of circle \( J \), which directly leads to the calculation of 20 units.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the calculations and the closest match to the answer choices, the correct choice is 20.6.

**Solution:**

Given that \( JK \) is the diameter of circle \( J \), the length of \( JK \) is calculated as:

\[ JK = 2 \times \text{Radius of Circle } J = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ units} \]

The closest answer choice to 20 is 20.6.
