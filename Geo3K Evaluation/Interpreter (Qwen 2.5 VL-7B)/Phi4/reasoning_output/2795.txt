1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - We have a quadrilateral \(W, X, Y, Z\).
   - The sum of the internal angles of any quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
   - We are given that the measure of \(\angle XYZ\) is equal to the measure of \(\angle X, Y, Z\).
   - We need to find \(m \angle Z\), which is \(\angle ZWY\).

2. **Summarize Known Angle Relationships:**
   - Let the measures of the angles be:
     - \( \angle WXY = a \)
     - \( \angle XYZ = b \)
     - \( \angle YZW = c \)
     - \( \angle ZWX = d \)
   - Given: \(a + b + c + d = 360^\circ\)
   - Given: \(b = \angle X, Y, Z\)

3. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - The problem states that the measure of \(\angle XYZ\) (which is \(b\)) is equal to \(\angle X, Y, Z\). This implies \(b\) is given directly as a measure, but no specific value is provided.
   - We need to find \(m \angle Z\), which is \(\angle ZWY = c\).

4. **Explore Possible Values:**
   - Since \(b\) is not explicitly given, we assume it must be calculated or inferred from the options.
   - The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\), so:
     \[
     a + b + c + d = 360^\circ
     \]
   - We need to find \(c\).

5. **Consider the Options:**
   - We have answer choices for \(m \angle Z\): 80, 108, 110, 112.
   - Assume \(b\) is a typical angle measure that fits within the constraints of a quadrilateral.

6. **Calculate Possible Values:**
   - Assume \(b\) is a typical angle measure that fits within the constraints of a quadrilateral.
   - Let's try to find a consistent set of angles:
     - Assume \(b = 108^\circ\) (since it is one of the options and could be a reasonable angle in a quadrilateral).
     - Then, \(a + 108^\circ + c + d = 360^\circ\).
     - Rearrange to find \(a + c + d = 252^\circ\).

7. **Verify with Options:**
   - Assume \(c = 108^\circ\) (since it is one of the options).
   - Then, \(a + 108^\circ + 108^\circ + d = 360^\circ\).
   - Simplify to \(a + d = 144^\circ\).

8. **Check Consistency:**
   - If \(a\) and \(d\) are both positive angles, this is possible.
   - Therefore, \(c = 108^\circ\) is a consistent solution.

9. **Reflect and Conclude:**
   - The assumption \(b = 108^\circ\) fits well with the constraints and provides a consistent solution.
   - Therefore, \(m \angle Z = 108^\circ\).

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle Z\) (or \(m \angle Z\)) is \(108^\circ\). This fits the given constraints and is consistent with the properties of a quadrilateral.

Final Answer: B.
