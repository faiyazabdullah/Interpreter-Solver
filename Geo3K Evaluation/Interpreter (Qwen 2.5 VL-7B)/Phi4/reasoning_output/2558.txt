### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**

The problem states that triangle \( \triangle QRS \) is equilateral. This means:

- All sides of the triangle are equal in length.
- All interior angles are \( 60^\circ \).

**Step 2: Identifying What Needs to be Found**

We need to determine the length of \( RS \) given the equilateral nature of the triangle. Since all sides are equal, finding \( RS \) is equivalent to finding the length of any side of the triangle.

**Step 3: Applying Geometric Properties**

For an equilateral triangle with side length \( a \):

- The perimeter is \( 3a \).
- The area can be calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2
  \]

However, these formulas are not directly needed to find \( RS \) since we are only asked for the side length.

**Step 4: Using Given Information**

Since the triangle is equilateral, \( QR = RS = QS \). The problem does not provide specific numerical values for these lengths, but it implies that they are equal.

**Step 5: Considering the Answer Choices**

The answer choices are numerical values: 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2. Since no specific units or additional information are given, we assume the side length is a simple integer or half-integer.

**Step 6: Logical Deduction**

In typical problems involving equilateral triangles without additional constraints, the simplest assumption is that the side length is 1. This is a common assumption in geometry problems unless specified otherwise.

**Step 7: Verification and Comparison**

Assuming \( QR = RS = QS = 1 \) satisfies the condition of an equilateral triangle. This matches one of the given answer choices.

**Step 8: Conclusion**

Given the lack of additional constraints or specific measurements, the simplest and most logical assumption is that the side length of the equilateral triangle is 1.

<Solution>

### Solution Section

Given that \( \triangle QRS \) is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. The problem does not provide specific measurements, so we assume the simplest case where each side is of unit length. Therefore, the length of \( RS \) is 1.

Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct choice is:
