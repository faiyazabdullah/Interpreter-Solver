### Analysis of Given Constraints and Required Solution

1. **Understanding the Given Figures**:
   - We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\) and a square \(EFGH\).
   - The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is given, but its value is not specified in the problem statement.
   - We know the lengths of all sides of the parallelogram and the square, but specific lengths are not provided in the problem statement.

2. **Identify Similar Figures**:
   - The problem asks us to find the area of the "green figure," which is implied to be one of the given figures, likely the square \(EFGH\), since it's the only figure typically associated with a specific color in geometry problems.
   - To find the area of the square \(EFGH\), we need to establish a relationship between the square and the parallelogram.

3. **Geometric Properties**:
   - For the square \(EFGH\), all sides are equal: \(EF = FG = GH = HE\).
   - The area of a square is calculated as \( \text{side}^2 \).

4. **Similarity and Scaling**:
   - If the square \(EFGH\) is similar to the parallelogram \(ABCD\), there must be a scaling factor between them.
   - However, since a square and a parallelogram are not similar in general (unless the parallelogram is a rhombus and both are squares), we need to assume that the problem implies a proportional relationship in terms of area.

5. **Area Relationships**:
   - Letâ€™s assume the side length of the square \(EFGH\) is \(s\).
   - The area of the square is \(s^2\).
   - If the square is similar to the parallelogram in terms of area, and given the options, we need to find a plausible area for the square.

6. **Exploration of Possible Areas**:
   - The problem does not provide the area of the parallelogram, but we can infer that the area of the square is a multiple of the area of the parallelogram.
   - Given the answer choices, we should consider typical area relationships: \(9, 18, 72, 144\).

7. **Verification and Calculation**:
   - Assume the area of the parallelogram is \(x\).
   - If the square is similar in terms of area, then \(s^2 = k \cdot x\) for some scaling factor \(k\).
   - Given the choices, \(s^2\) could be \(9, 18, 72, 144\).

8. **Logical Deduction**:
   - The area of the square \(s^2\) must be a reasonable multiple of a typical parallelogram area.
   - Considering common geometric scaling and typical problem setups, \(144\) is a plausible area for a square when compared to typical parallelogram areas in educational problems.

### Reassessment and Conclusion

- The problem likely implies a direct scaling of areas between the square and the parallelogram.
- Given the answer choices and typical problem setups, the area of the square \(EFGH\) is most reasonably \(144\) when considering common educational problem structures.

</think>

**Solution**:

1. **Assume a Scaling Factor**:
   - Assume the area of the parallelogram is \(x\).
   - The area of the square \(s^2\) is a multiple of \(x\).

2. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - The area of the square \(s^2\) could be \(9, 18, 72, 144\).
   - \(144\) is a common area for a square in educational problems, suggesting a scaling factor of \(16\) if the parallelogram's area is \(9\) (since \(144 = 16 \times 9\)).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the typical problem setups and the answer choices, the area of the square \(EFGH\) is most likely \(144\).
