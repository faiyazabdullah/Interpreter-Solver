**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are dealing with a parallelogram ABCD with specific properties:
  - All sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
  - Opposite angles are equal in a parallelogram.
  - Adjacent angles are supplementary in a parallelogram.
  - Diagonals bisect each other in a parallelogram.
  - The diagonals intersect at point F.
  
**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Thus, \(AF = FC\) and \(BF = FD\).
- Since all sides are equal, this is not just any parallelogram but a rhombus.
- In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).
- Therefore, \(\angle AFD = \angle BFC = \angle CFD = \angle AFB = 90^\circ\).

**Step 4: Consider the Properties of a Rhombus**
- Since \(\angle AFD = 90^\circ\), and diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus, each of the angles at the vertices is bisected by the diagonals.
- Thus, \(\angle DAF = \angle DAC\) and \(\angle CDF = \angle CDA\).

**Step 5: Calculate \(\angle ADC\)**
- In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles, so \(\angle DAC = \angle DCA\).
- Let \(\angle DAF = \angle DCA = x\).
- Therefore, \(\angle ADC = 2x\).
- Since \(\angle AFD = 90^\circ\), \(\angle DAF + \angle CDA = 90^\circ\).
- Thus, \(x + x = 90^\circ\), so \(2x = 90^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\).

**Step 6: Reassess the Calculation**
- Since \(\angle ADC\) is not directly calculated as 90 degrees, consider the supplementary nature of angles in a parallelogram.
- \(\angle ADC\) and \(\angle DAB\) are supplementary.
- \(\angle DAB = 2x = 90^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\).

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\) does not match any of the given choices.
- Re-evaluate the nature of the angles:
  - In a rhombus, \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\).
  - Since \(\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ\), and \(\angle A = \angle C\), \(\angle B = \angle D\).
  - If \(\angle A = 72^\circ\), then \(\angle C = 72^\circ\), and \(\angle B = \angle D = 108^\circ\).
  - Therefore, \(\angle ADC = 108^\circ\).

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**
- The closest answer to 108 degrees is 128 degrees.
</think>

**Solution:**
- Given the properties of a rhombus and the supplementary nature of angles in a parallelogram, \(\angle ADC\) is calculated as 108 degrees.
- The closest provided answer choice is 128 degrees.

Final Answer: D. 128
