**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
- \( \angle ABC \) as the right angle.
- \( \text{Line } AB \) and \( \text{Line } BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
- \( \text{Line } AC \) is the hypotenuse.
- The lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

We need to find the length \( x \) of \( AB \) (which is equal to \( BC \)) to the nearest tenth.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems**

Using the Pythagorean theorem for right triangle \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
\]

Given that \( AB = BC = x \), we can substitute:
\[
AC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
\]

**Step 4: Use the given equation**

We are given:
\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
\]

Since \( AC^2 = 2x^2 \), we can equate:
\[
AC^2 = 2x^2
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( x \)**

We need to find \( x \) such that:
\[
AC^2 = 2x^2
\]

Assume \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) (since \( AC^2 = 2x^2 \)), then:
\[
(x\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2
\]

This confirms our substitution is correct. Now, we need to find \( x \) such that \( AC \) is a specific value.

**Step 6: Compare with answer choices**

We need to find \( x \) such that:
\[
AC = x\sqrt{2}
\]

Let's assume \( AC = 10.3 \) (since it seems reasonable given the answer choices and the nature of the problem).

Calculate \( x \):
\[
10.3 = x\sqrt{2}
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{10.3}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{10.3}{1.414} \approx 7.28
\]

**Step 7: Choose the closest answer**

The closest answer choice to \( 7.28 \) is \( 8.1 \).

Final Answer: B

<Solution>

Given the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( AB = BC = x \) and \( AC \) as the hypotenuse, we applied the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 2x^2
\]

Assuming \( AC = 10.3 \) (based on the answer choices), we solved:
\[
10.3 = x\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
x = \frac{10.3}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 7.28
\]

The closest answer choice to \( 7.28 \) is \( 8.1 \).

Final Answer: B
