**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

We are given a triangle \( \triangle QRS \) with the following properties:
- Points \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \) are vertices.
- Line segments \( QR \), \( RS \), and \( QS \) form the sides of the triangle.
- It is stated that the lengths of these sides are equal, i.e., \( QR = RS = QS \).

From this, we can infer that \( \triangle QRS \) is an equilateral triangle because all three sides are equal in length.

**Step 2: Identify the Objective**

The task is to find the length of \( QS \). Given the properties of an equilateral triangle, \( QS \) is the same as \( QR \) and \( RS \).

**Step 3: Consider Additional Information**

The problem states "LengthOf(Line(Q,S))" without providing a specific numerical value. However, the problem gives us answer choices: 5, 15, 20, and 25.

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems**

In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, if one side's length is known, the others are the same. We need to determine which of the given answer choices could be the length of \( QS \).

**Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices**

Since no specific numerical value is provided in the problem statement, we must choose the most reasonable answer based on typical geometric constraints and the given options.

**Step 6: Compare and Select the Closest Answer**

Given the options:
- A. 5
- B. 15
- C. 20
- D. 25

Without additional context, we assume a typical scenario where the side length of an equilateral triangle is a reasonable value. Among the options, 15 is a common choice for the side length of a triangle in many geometric problems.

**Step 7: Final Verification**

Reassess the choices: 5 might be too short for a typical geometric problem unless specified otherwise. 20 and 25 are larger, but without additional context, 15 is a reasonable middle ground.

**Step 8: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis and typical geometric problem settings, the most reasonable choice for the length of \( QS \) is 15.

**Solution**

Given the equilateral nature of \( \triangle QRS \) and the typical values used in geometric problems, the most reasonable choice for the length of \( QS \) is 15. Therefore, the final answer is:
