1. **Analyze the Given Information**: 
   - We are given a circle \( \odot S \).
   - Points \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) lie on the circle.
   - Arc \( PQR \) and arc \( PQ \) are part of the circle.
   - Measure of arc \( PQR \) is given as \( 98^\circ \).

2. **Identify the Objective**:
   - We need to find the measure of arc \( PQ \), denoted as \( m \widehat{PQ} \).

3. **Understand Geometric Relationships**:
   - Arc \( PQR \) is a major arc that includes points \( P, Q, \) and \( R \).
   - Arc \( PQ \) is a minor arc that includes only points \( P \) and \( Q \).

4. **Apply Geometric Theorems**:
   - The measure of the entire circle is \( 360^\circ \).
   - The measure of arc \( PQR \) is the sum of arcs \( PQ \) and \( QR \).
   - Since \( PQR \) is a major arc, the remaining part of the circle is the minor arc \( PR \).

5. **Calculate the Measure of Arc \( PR \)**:
   - The measure of arc \( PR \) is \( 360^\circ - 98^\circ = 262^\circ \).

6. **Determine the Relationship Between Arcs**:
   - Arc \( PQR \) consists of arcs \( PQ \) and \( QR \).
   - Since \( PR \) is a minor arc, \( PQ + QR = 98^\circ \).

7. **Find the Measure of Arc \( PQ \)**:
   - Since \( PR \) is a minor arc, \( PQ \) must be less than half of \( 360^\circ \).
   - Arc \( PR \) is the complement of arc \( PQR \) in the circle.
   - Therefore, arc \( PQ \) is part of arc \( PR \).

8. **Use Symmetry and Calculation**:
   - If \( PQ + QR = 98^\circ \) and \( PR = 262^\circ \), then \( PQ + QR + PR = 360^\circ \).
   - Since \( PQ + QR = 98^\circ \), and \( PR = 262^\circ \), the symmetry of the circle implies \( PQ = PR - QR \).
   - Given \( PQ + QR = 98^\circ \), and knowing \( PR = 262^\circ \), we can infer that \( PQ = \frac{98^\circ}{2} = 49^\circ \) because \( PQ \) and \( QR \) are symmetrically placed around \( Q \).

9. **Verify and Compare**:
   - Check the calculations: \( PQ + QR = 98^\circ \) and \( PR = 262^\circ \).
   - \( PQ = 49^\circ \) fits the symmetry and calculation constraints.

10. **Select the Closest Answer**:
    - The calculated measure of arc \( PQ \) is \( 49^\circ \).
    - Compare with answer choices: A. 45, B. 49, C. 90, D. 98.
    - The closest match is \( 49^\circ \).

</think> "Solution section": Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of arc \( PQ \) is \( 49^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is B. Final Answer: B.
