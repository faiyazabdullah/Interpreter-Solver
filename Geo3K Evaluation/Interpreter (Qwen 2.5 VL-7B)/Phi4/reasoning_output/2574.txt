1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \( \odot K \) with center \( K \).
   - Points \( G \) and \( J \) are on the circle such that line segment \( GJ \) is a diameter.
   - There is an angle \( \angle GKJ \) with its vertex at \( K \).
   - We need to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \).

2. **Understanding the Implications:**
   - Since \( GJ \) is a diameter, by the properties of a circle, \( \angle GJ \) subtends a semicircle. Thus, \( \angle GKJ \) is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is a right angle.
   - The measure of angle \( \angle GKJ \) is 90 degrees, as it is inscribed in a semicircle.

3. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We are asked to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \).
   - The angle \( \angle GKJ \) is given as 90 degrees, and it is subtended by the arc \( \widehat{GJ} \).

4. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - The measure of the arc \( \widehat{GJ} \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle GKJ \) because the angle at the center is twice any angle at the circumference subtending the same arc.
   - Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{GJ} \) is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) degrees.

5. **Considering Point \( L \):**
   - Point \( L \) is on the circle, but its exact position relative to \( G \) and \( J \) is not specified.
   - We need to determine the measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \). Since \( GJ \) is a diameter, the circle is divided into two semicircles by \( GJ \).

6. **Exploring Possible Scenarios:**
   - If \( L \) is on the arc \( \widehat{GJ} \), then \( \widehat{GLJ} \) would be a part of the semicircle, less than 180 degrees.
   - If \( L \) is on the opposite arc from \( G \) to \( J \), then \( \widehat{GLJ} \) would be the entire semicircle, which is 180 degrees.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( GJ \) is a diameter, the arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) that does not include \( GJ \) itself must be the other semicircle, which is 180 degrees.

8. **Verification:**
   - The measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) must be 180 degrees because it represents the semicircle opposite to the diameter \( GJ \).

</think>
<Solution>
Given that \( GJ \) is a diameter of the circle \( \odot K \), the circle is divided into two equal semicircles by \( GJ \). The arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) that does not include the diameter \( GJ \) itself must be the semicircle opposite to \( GJ \). Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is 180 degrees.
