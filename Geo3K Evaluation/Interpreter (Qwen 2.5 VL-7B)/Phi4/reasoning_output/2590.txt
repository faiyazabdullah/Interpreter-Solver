**Step 1: Analyze the Problem**

- We are given a right triangle \( \triangle GHI \) with a right angle at \( H \).
- The lengths of \( GH \) and \( HI \) are given as 9 and 9 respectively, since \( GH = HI = 9 \).
- We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \( GI \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find \( GI \), the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle GHI \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( \triangle GHI \) is a right triangle with \( \angle GHI = 90^\circ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  GI^2 = GH^2 + HI^2
  \]

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**

- Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  GI^2 = 9^2 + 9^2 = 81 + 81 = 162
  \]
- Solve for \( GI \):
  \[
  GI = \sqrt{162} = \sqrt{81 \times 2} = \sqrt{81} \times \sqrt{2} = 9\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 5: Approximate and Compare**

- Calculate \( 9\sqrt{2} \):
  - Since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we have:
  \[
  9 \times 1.414 \approx 12.726
  \]
- Compare this approximation with the answer choices: 6, 9, 12, 15.
- The closest value to 12.726 is 12.

**Step 6: Verify and Reflect**

- Reassess the calculations to ensure no errors were made.
- The use of the Pythagorean theorem was appropriate, and the approximation of \( \sqrt{2} \) was correctly applied.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the calculations and comparison, the closest answer choice is 12.

**Solution:**

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle \( \triangle GHI \), we calculated the hypotenuse \( GI \) as \( 9\sqrt{2} \), which approximates to 12.726. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest value is 12.
