1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\). This means that the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on a single circle.
   - We are given angles \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ADC\).
   - The sum of angles \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC\) is provided as part of the problem's data.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find \(m \angle B\), which refers to the measure of \(\angle ABC\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ\).
   - Given that the sum of \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ADC\) is already provided, this confirms the cyclic nature and allows us to use the property directly.

4. **Consider the Possible Values for \(\angle ABC\):**
   - We need to calculate or estimate \(\angle ABC\) based on the given sum and the provided answer choices.

5. **Calculate and Compare:**
   - Since \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ\), and we are looking for \(m \angle B = m \angle ABC\), we need to consider the options provided.
   - The answer choices are: \(29^\circ\), \(58^\circ\), \(61^\circ\), and \(122^\circ\).
   - If \(\angle ABC = 58^\circ\), then \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ - 58^\circ = 122^\circ\).
   - If \(\angle ABC = 122^\circ\), then \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ - 122^\circ = 58^\circ\).

6. **Verify and Refine:**
   - Both \(58^\circ\) and \(122^\circ\) satisfy the condition \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ\).
   - Since we are asked to find \(m \angle B\), which is \(\angle ABC\), and both \(58^\circ\) and \(122^\circ\) are valid, we choose the one that is explicitly listed as an option for \(\angle ABC\).

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Given the symmetry and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, both \(58^\circ\) and \(122^\circ\) are mathematically valid for \(\angle ABC\).
   - The problem asks for \(m \angle B\), which is \(\angle ABC\), and \(58^\circ\) is directly listed as an option.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest and most straightforward choice for \(m \angle B\) based on the options is \(58^\circ\).
</think>

**Solution:**
- Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ\).
- Given the answer choices, \(58^\circ\) is a valid measure for \(\angle ABC\) since it satisfies the condition with \(\angle ADC = 122^\circ\).
- Therefore, the measure of \(\angle B\) is \(58^\circ\).
