**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints and Given Information**

We have points \(A, B, C, D, E\) and lines connecting them in a closed loop: \(AB, BC, CD, DE, EA\). We are given:
- \(AB = 12\)
- \(AC = 16\)
- \(ED = 5\)

We need to find \(AE\).

**Step 2: Identify the Structure**

The problem implies a geometric shape, likely a pentagon, but we need to explore if there are simpler configurations or properties that could help, such as triangles or cyclic properties.

**Step 3: Consider Possible Geometric Properties**

Given the lengths and the closed loop, consider if the points form a cyclic pentagon or if any triangles can be formed with known properties. The given lengths suggest potential use of the triangle inequality or Pythagorean theorem if right triangles are involved.

**Step 4: Explore Triangle Formations**

Since \(AC = 16\) and \(AB = 12\), consider triangle \(ABC\). However, without more information about \(BC\), we cannot directly solve for \(AE\) using this triangle.

**Step 5: Consider Cyclic Properties**

If the points form a cyclic pentagon, Ptolemy's theorem might be applicable. However, without knowing if the pentagon is cyclic or having more side lengths, this is speculative.

**Step 6: Reassess Given Lengths and Possible Configurations**

Given \(ED = 5\), consider triangle \(ADE\). We know \(AD\) is part of the line segments \(AB, BC, CD\), but without \(CD\) or \(BD\), we cannot directly use the triangle inequality here.

**Step 7: Reflect on Possible Simplifications**

Given the symmetry and the closed loop, consider if the pentagon could be simplified into known shapes. The problem might imply a simpler configuration like a rectangle or isosceles trapezoid.

**Step 8: Explore Diagonal Relationships**

Since \(AC = 16\) and \(AB = 12\), consider if \(AC\) is a diagonal of a rectangle or other quadrilateral formed by \(A, B, C, D, E\).

**Step 9: Calculate Using Possible Diagonal Properties**

If \(AC\) is a diagonal in a rectangle or similar shape, and \(ED = 5\), consider if \(AE\) could be a diagonal or side related to these lengths.

**Step 10: Use Approximation and Closest Match**

Given the lack of direct calculation, approximate using the closest match to known lengths. The choices are \(12, 15, 16, 20\).

- \(AC = 16\) suggests \(AE\) might be close to \(16\) if \(A, C, E\) form a triangle or part of a symmetric shape.
- \(AB = 12\) and \(ED = 5\) suggest \(AE\) is not \(12\) or \(5\).

**Step 11: Finalize Based on Closest Logical Match**

Given the constraints and possible configurations, \(AE = 16\) seems the most plausible, as it matches one of the given lengths and fits a symmetric or cyclic assumption.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and exploration of geometric properties, the most logical conclusion is that \(AE\) is closest to \(16\), given the constraints and possible configurations of the points and lines.
