**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(AB = BC\). This implies the rectangle is actually a square because all sides are equal.
- There is a circle centered at \(A\) with a radius equal to the length of \(AB\).
- There is another circle centered at \(H\) with the same radius as circle \(A\), and the line \(HA\) is equal to this radius.
- The intersection of the two circles is shaded.

**Step 2: Summarize the Findings**

- The radius of both circles is the side length of the square, say \(s\).
- Since \(HA = s\), point \(H\) lies on the circumference of circle \(A\).
- The intersection of the two circles forms a lens-shaped region.

**Step 3: Explore the Geometry**

- The distance between the centers of the two circles, \(AH\), is equal to the radius \(s\).
- When two circles intersect such that the distance between their centers is equal to their radius, the intersection forms two equal circular segments.

**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Intersection**

- The angle subtended by the chord \(AH\) at the center of circle \(A\) (or \(H\)) is \(120^\circ\) because the triangle \(AHO\) (where \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AH\)) is equilateral.
- The area of one circular segment is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of segment} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
  \]
  where \(r\) is the radius and \(\theta\) is in radians.

- Convert \(120^\circ\) to radians: \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

- Calculate the area of one segment:
  \[
  \text{Area of one segment} = \frac{1}{2} s^2 \left(\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right)
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{1}{2} s^2 \left(\frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
  \]

- The total shaded area (two segments) is:
  \[
  \text{Total shaded area} = s^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Refine Calculations**

- Assume \(s = 1\) for simplicity (since the radius is not given, the area will be proportional to \(s^2\)).
- Calculate the numerical value:
  \[
  \text{Total shaded area} = 1^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
  \]
  \[
  \approx 1 \times (1.0472 - 0.8660) \approx 0.1812
  \]

- If \(s\) were 10 (for example), the area would be:
  \[
  100 \times 0.1812 = 18.12
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to 18.12 is 19.6.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the calculations, the area of the shaded region is closest to 19.6.

**Solution:**

1. Recognize the intersection of two circles with equal radii and centers \(s\) apart forms two equal segments.
2. Calculate the area of one segment using the formula for a circular segment.
3. Double the segment area for the total intersection area.
4. Assume a unit radius for simplicity, then scale up.
5. Compare calculated area with given options.
