**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given that the triangle has angles in the ratio 3:2:1. This implies that if we denote the smallest angle by \( x \), then the angles can be expressed as \( 3x \), \( 2x \), and \( x \).

**Step 2: Apply the Triangle Angle Sum Property**

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
3x + 2x + x = 180^\circ
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Combine the terms:

\[
6x = 180^\circ
\]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[
x = 30^\circ
\]

**Step 4: Determine the Measures of the Angles**

Now that we have \( x = 30^\circ \), we can find the measures of the angles:

- The smallest angle is \( x = 30^\circ \).
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \).
- The largest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The angles of the triangle are \( 30^\circ \), \( 60^\circ \), and \( 90^\circ \).

- A. \( 30^\circ \) is an angle of the triangle.
- B. \( 45^\circ \) is not an angle of the triangle.
- C. \( 60^\circ \) is an angle of the triangle.
- D. \( 90^\circ \) is an angle of the triangle.

**Step 6: Select the Correct Answer**

The angle that is not a measure of the triangle is \( 45^\circ \).

<Solution>

Based on the analysis, the angles of the triangle are \( 30^\circ \), \( 60^\circ \), and \( 90^\circ \). The angle \( 45^\circ \) is not one of these measures. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
