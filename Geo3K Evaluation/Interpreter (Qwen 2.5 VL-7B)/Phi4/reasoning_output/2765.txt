**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- From the properties of a parallelogram:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
  - Opposite sides are equal in length: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We are asked to find the scale from \(B\) to \(B'\).
- This implies a dilation or transformation involving a scaling factor that maps point \(B\) to point \(B'\).

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Geometric Properties**

- Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, and we are dealing with a scale factor, we need to consider how scaling affects the sides.
- The scale factor from \(B\) to \(B'\) would imply a transformation that affects the length of \(AB\) or \(BC\).

**Step 4: Consider Possible Transformations**

- If \(B\) is transformed to \(B'\) through a scaling transformation, the scale factor would be the ratio of the new length to the original length.
- Since \(B\) and \(B'\) are points on the same line (either \(AB\) or \(BC\)), the scale factor would be the ratio of \(BB'\) to \(BC\) or \(AB\).

**Step 5: Calculate the Scale Factor**

- Without specific coordinates or additional information, we assume a uniform scaling of the parallelogram.
- The scale factor is typically given as a ratio of lengths. Since the problem does not specify any changes in dimensions, we assume a standard transformation.
- The possible scale factors given are \(\frac{3}{4}\), \(\frac{5}{6}\), \(\frac{6}{5}\), and \(\frac{4}{3}\).

**Step 6: Determine the Most Reasonable Scale Factor**

- In a typical scaling problem involving a parallelogram, the scale factor is often less than 1 if the figure is shrinking or greater than 1 if it is expanding.
- Without loss of generality, assume a standard transformation where the figure is scaled down or up.
- Given the choices, \(\frac{6}{5}\) and \(\frac{4}{3}\) suggest an expansion, while \(\frac{3}{4}\) and \(\frac{5}{6}\) suggest a contraction.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Since no specific transformation details are given, and assuming a standard problem setup, a common transformation might involve a slight expansion or contraction.
- \(\frac{6}{5}\) suggests a slight expansion, which is a reasonable assumption for a typical problem setup.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis and typical problem setups involving scaling transformations of geometric figures, the most reasonable assumption is a slight expansion. Therefore, the scale factor from \(B\) to \(B'\) is \(\frac{6}{5}\).
