1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints**: We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A, B, \) and \( C \). There are points \( M, R, \) and \( S \), and lines \( R M, S M, \) and \( T A \). The constraints are:
   - \( M \) is a point on the plane.
   - \( R M = 4 \), \( M C = 7 \), and \( A T = 16 \).
   - \( L(M, R) = L(M, C) = L(A, T) \) implies \( R M = M C = A T \).

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings**:
   - From the given constraints, we know \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \).
   - The constraint \( L(M, R) = L(M, C) = L(A, T) \) indicates that \( R M = M C = A T \).
   - However, \( A T = 16 \) contradicts \( R M = M C = A T \) unless there is a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.

3. **Exploration**:
   - Since \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \), the equality \( L(M, R) = L(M, C) = L(A, T) \) cannot hold true numerically as stated.
   - We need to find \( M S \) given the constraints and the closest possible interpretation of the problem.

4. **Reassessment**:
   - The equality \( L(M, R) = L(M, C) = L(A, T) \) seems to be a misinterpretation. It might imply that \( M \) is equidistant from \( R \) and \( C \) under certain conditions, but not necessarily equal to \( A T \).
   - We need to find \( M S \) using the given \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \).

5. **Reflection and Calculation**:
   - Since \( M \) is equidistant from \( R \) and \( C \), we can consider \( M \) as the midpoint of a segment \( R C \) in a hypothetical scenario.
   - If \( M \) is the midpoint of \( R C \), then \( R M = M C = \frac{R C}{2} \).
   - Given \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \), this scenario does not hold as \( R M \neq M C \).

6. **Backtracing and Iteration**:
   - Re-evaluate the problem: \( M \) is not necessarily the midpoint, but we need to find \( M S \).
   - Consider the possibility of a geometric configuration where \( M S \) is related to \( R M \) or \( M C \).
   - Since \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \), and no direct relationship is given for \( M S \), we consider the simplest case where \( M S \) could be equal to one of these lengths or a simple arithmetic relationship.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - Given the lack of direct information about \( M S \), and considering the closest possible geometric interpretation, \( M S \) could be a simple average or difference.
   - Calculate \( M S \) as the difference \( M C - R M = 7 - 4 = 3 \).

8. **Comparison with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated \( M S = 3 \) is closest to answer choice B, which is 3.5.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the closest value to the calculated \( M S = 3 \) is 3.5. Therefore, the correct answer choice is B.

Final Answer: B
