1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - The lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
   - There are four right angles: \(\angle ABC\), \(\angle BCD\), \(\angle CDA\), and \(\angle DAB\).
   - Each of these angles is equal, which means \(\angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = \angle DAB\).

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - Since each angle is a right angle, \(\angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = \angle DAB = 90^\circ\).
   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

3. **Brainstorm and Verify:**
   - Given that all angles are right angles and equal, the quadrilateral must be a rectangle.
   - Since all angles are \(90^\circ\), the quadrilateral is not just any rectangle but a square, as all sides must be equal for the angles to be equal and right.

4. **Reassess and Refine:**
   - The problem asks us to find \(x\), but \(x\) is not explicitly defined in the problem statement.
   - Given the constraints, it seems \(x\) refers to the measure of each angle, which is \(90^\circ\).

5. **Reflect and Backtrace:**
   - Verify that the interpretation of \(x\) as the angle measure is consistent with the problem's constraints.
   - Since all angles are \(90^\circ\), and the problem states that all angles are equal, \(x\) must be \(90^\circ\).

6. **Iterate and Confirm:**
   - Re-evaluate the problem to ensure no other interpretation of \(x\) fits the given constraints.
   - The only logical conclusion is that \(x\) represents the measure of each angle, which is \(90^\circ\).

</think>

<Solution>

Based on the analysis and verification steps, each angle in the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(90^\circ\). The problem asks for the value of \(x\), which, given the context and constraints, is the measure of these equal angles. Therefore, \(x = 90^\circ\).

Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A. 60
- B. 80
- C. 90
- D. 120

The correct choice is \(90\).
