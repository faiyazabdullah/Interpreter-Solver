**Step 1: Analyze the given information**

We know that ABCD is a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA must all be the same. 

Given:
- \( AB = 2x + 3 \)
- \( BC = x + 7 \)
- We need to find \( CD \).

**Step 2: Summarize the relevant properties of a rhombus**

Since ABCD is a rhombus:
- \( AB = BC = CD = DA \)

**Step 3: Set up the equation**

Since \( AB = BC \), we can equate the expressions for these two sides:
\[ 2x + 3 = x + 7 \]

**Step 4: Solve the equation**

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 2x - x + 3 = 7 \]
\[ x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the length of CD**

Since \( CD = AB \) (all sides of a rhombus are equal), substitute \( x = 4 \) into the expression for \( AB \):
\[ CD = 2x + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 6: Verify the calculation**

We calculated \( CD = 11 \). Let's verify:
- \( AB = 2x + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 11 \)
- \( BC = x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \)
- \( CD = 11 \) (as calculated)
- \( DA = AB = 11 \)

All sides are equal, confirming the properties of a rhombus.

**Step 7: Compare with answer choices**

The calculated length of \( CD \) is 11, which matches option B.

**Step 8: Finalize the solution**

The correct answer choice is B.

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the properties of a rhombus: all sides are equal.
2. Set up the equation \( 2x + 3 = x + 7 \) and solve for \( x \).
3. Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 \) to find \( CD \).
4. Verify that all sides are equal with \( x = 4 \).
5. Compare the calculated length of \( CD \) with the answer choices.
6. Select the closest match, which is 11.

Final Answer: B
