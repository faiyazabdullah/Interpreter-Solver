**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given that triangle \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral. This means all sides \( LM \), \( MN \), and \( NL \) are equal.
- Let the length of each side of the equilateral triangle be \( s \).
- \( MP \) bisects \( LN \), meaning \( P \) is the midpoint of \( LN \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the value of \( y \), which is not explicitly defined in the problem statement. However, it is likely related to the geometric properties or measurements involving \( MP \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all angles are \( 60^\circ \).
- \( MP \) bisects \( LN \), so \( LP = PN = \frac{s}{2} \).
- In an equilateral triangle, the line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is also an altitude, median, and angle bisector.

**Step 4: Calculate Length of \( MP \)**

- Consider \( \triangle LMP \) (right triangle because \( MP \) is an altitude in the equilateral triangle).
- Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle LMP \):
  \[
  LM^2 = LP^2 + MP^2
  \]
  \[
  s^2 = \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + MP^2
  \]
  \[
  s^2 = \frac{s^2}{4} + MP^2
  \]
  \[
  MP^2 = s^2 - \frac{s^2}{4}
  \]
  \[
  MP^2 = \frac{3s^2}{4}
  \]
  \[
  MP = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}
  \]

**Step 5: Determine the Relationship with \( y \)**

- Since \( y \) is not directly defined, it is reasonable to assume \( y \) is related to the length of \( MP \).
- If \( s = 2y \) (a common assumption in such problems to relate side length to a variable), then:
  \[
  MP = \frac{(2y)\sqrt{3}}{2} = y\sqrt{3}
  \]

**Step 6: Solve for \( y \)**

- We need to find \( y \) such that \( MP = y\sqrt{3} \) matches one of the given answer choices when \( s = 2y \).
- Assume \( s = 2y \), then:
  \[
  MP = \frac{(2y)\sqrt{3}}{2} = y\sqrt{3}
  \]
- We need \( y\sqrt{3} \) to be a reasonable integer value.
- Test the answer choices:
  - If \( y = 15 \), \( MP = 15\sqrt{3} \approx 25.98 \)
  - If \( y = 16 \), \( MP = 16\sqrt{3} \approx 27.71 \)
  - If \( y = 17 \), \( MP = 17\sqrt{3} \approx 29.44 \)
  - If \( y = 18 \), \( MP = 18\sqrt{3} \approx 31.18 \)

- The closest integer value for \( MP \) that makes sense geometrically (considering typical problem setups) is when \( y = 16 \).

**Step 7: Compare and Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated \( MP \approx 27.71 \) for \( y = 16 \) is the closest reasonable integer approximation for a typical geometric problem setup.

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the calculations and assumptions, the value of \( y \) that fits the geometric constraints and provides a reasonable integer approximation for \( MP \) is \( y = 16 \).
