**Step 1: Analyzing the Problem Statement**

- We are given a parallelogram ABCD with points A, B, C, and D.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA are the sides of the parallelogram.
- We have information about the angles at these points, specifically:
  - \(\angle A\) and \(\angle C\) are equal.
  - \(\angle B\) and \(\angle D\) are equal.

**Step 2: Summarizing Known Properties**

- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. This means \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\).
- The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
- Therefore, for parallelogram ABCD, we have:
  \[
  \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
  \]
- Given \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\), we can simplify the equation:
  \[
  2\angle A + 2\angle B = 360^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ
  \]

**Step 3: Exploring the Angle Relationships**

- Since \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\), we can express \(\angle C\) and \(\angle D\) in terms of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle B\):
  \[
  \angle C = \angle A \quad \text{and} \quad \angle D = \angle B
  \]
- From the equation \(\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ\), we can express \(\angle B\) in terms of \(\angle A\):
  \[
  \angle B = 180^\circ - \angle A
  \]

**Step 4: Applying the Given Equalities**

- We need to find \(m \angle A\).
- Since \(\angle A = \angle C\), and \(\angle B = \angle D\), we can substitute back into the equation:
  \[
  \angle A + (180^\circ - \angle A) = 180^\circ
  \]
- This equation is always true, confirming the consistency of the relationships.

**Step 5: Solving for \(\angle A\)**

- We know that \(\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ\).
- Since \(\angle B = 180^\circ - \angle A\), we substitute:
  \[
  \angle A + (180^\circ - \angle A) = 180^\circ
  \]
- This simplifies to:
  \[
  2\angle A = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle A = 90^\circ
  \]

**Step 6: Verification and Comparison**

- Verify that \(\angle A = 90^\circ\) satisfies all conditions:
  - \(\angle A = \angle C = 90^\circ\)
  - \(\angle B = \angle D = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\)
- All angles add up to \(360^\circ\), confirming the solution is consistent with the properties of a parallelogram.

**Step 7: Selecting the Closest Answer**

- The calculated value of \(\angle A\) is \(90^\circ\).
- Among the given answer choices, \(90^\circ\) corresponds to option C.

**Solution**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle A\) is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
