**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given that triangle \( \triangle WT \cong \triangle TWY \). Congruence of triangles implies all corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- Corresponding sides: \( WT = TW \), \( TW = TY \), and \( WY = WT \).
- Corresponding angles: \( \angle WT = \angle TW \), \( \angle TW = \angle TY \), and \( \angle WY = \angle WT \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not specify what \( x \) represents directly. It is likely a side length or an angle measure.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( \triangle WT \cong \triangle TWY \), let's assume:
  - \( WT = TW = a \)
  - \( TY = b \)
  - \( WY = c \)

- From the congruence, we have:
  - \( a = b \)
  - \( b = c \)
  - \( c = a \)

- This implies \( a = b = c \), meaning \( \triangle WT \) and \( \triangle TWY \) are equilateral triangles.

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**

- Since all sides are equal in an equilateral triangle, \( x \) could represent the length of any side.
- Without loss of generality, assume \( x = WT = TW = TY = WY \).

**Step 5: Check for Additional Information**

- The problem does not provide explicit numerical values or equations involving \( x \).
- Given the symmetry and congruence, \( x \) must satisfy the condition of being equal for all sides.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- Since \( x \) represents a side length in an equilateral triangle, it must be a positive integer.
- The answer choices are: A. 2, B. 4, C. 5, D. 10.
- Without additional constraints, any of these could theoretically be \( x \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Since \( x \) is a side length in an equilateral triangle, and no further constraints are given, we choose the smallest positive integer that fits the symmetry and congruence.
- The smallest value is 2.

**Step 8: Final Verification**

- Reassess the logic: \( x \) must be consistent with the congruence and symmetry of the equilateral triangles.
- The smallest integer that satisfies this without additional constraints is indeed 2.

**Solution:**

Given the congruence \( \triangle WT \cong \triangle TWY \) and the properties of equilateral triangles derived from this congruence, \( x \) must be a side length of these triangles. Without additional numerical constraints, the smallest positive integer that fits is 2.

Final Answer: A
