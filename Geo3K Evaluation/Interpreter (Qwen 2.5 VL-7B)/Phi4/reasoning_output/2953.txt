### Thought Section:

1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - The constraints state that:
     - \( \angle A = \angle B = \angle C \)
     - \( AB = BC = AC \)
   - These conditions imply that \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle because all angles are equal and all sides are equal.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 3 \). However, the problem does not specify which angle is labeled as \( \angle 3 \). Given the symmetry and equal angles in an equilateral triangle, any angle in \( \triangle ABC \) can be considered \( \angle 3 \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - In an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are equal.
   - The sum of the internal angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, each angle in an equilateral triangle is \( \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \).

4. **Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps:**
   - The calculation of each angle being \( 60^\circ \) is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.
   - There are no errors in the logical steps taken so far.

5. **Refine Any Errors:**
   - There are no errors to refine as the steps align with known geometric properties.

6. **Revisit Previous Steps:**
   - Confirm that the interpretation of the problem constraints as defining an equilateral triangle is correct.
   - Reaffirm that the measure of each angle in an equilateral triangle is indeed \( 60^\circ \).

7. **Brainstorm New Ideas:**
   - Consider if there could be any additional context or interpretation for \( \angle 3 \) that might affect the solution. However, given the constraints, \( \angle 3 \) must be one of the angles of the equilateral triangle.

8. **Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle 3 \) is \( 60^\circ \).
   - Compare \( 60^\circ \) with the given answer choices: A. 85, B. 90, C. 95, D. 105.
   - The closest value to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 85^\circ \).

9. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - Since \( 60^\circ \) is not an option, select the closest value, which is \( 85^\circ \).

</think>

### Solution:

Given the constraints, \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle with each angle measuring \( 60^\circ \). The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle 3 \), which, given the symmetry and equal angles, is also \( 60^\circ \). Comparing \( 60^\circ \) with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \( 85^\circ \).
