1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given the measure of \(\angle 4\) as 42 degrees.
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle 7\).

2. **Identify Relationships:**
   - Typically, in geometric problems involving angles labeled like this, \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) might be part of a transversal intersecting two parallel lines, or they could be related angles in some other geometric configuration such as a polygon or a circle.
   - Common angle relationships include corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or supplementary angles (angles that add up to 180 degrees).

3. **Consider Possible Configurations:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are on a straight line, they are supplementary, meaning \(m \angle 4 + m \angle 7 = 180^\circ\).
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are alternate interior angles or corresponding angles formed by a transversal cutting through parallel lines, they would be equal.

4. **Apply Geometric Theorems:**
   - **Supplementary Angles:** If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are supplementary, then:
     \[
     m \angle 4 + m \angle 7 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     42 + m \angle 7 = 180
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 7 = 180 - 42 = 138
     \]

5. **Verify Calculations:**
   - The calculation for supplementary angles gives \(m \angle 7 = 138\).

6. **Consider Other Configurations:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are equal (e.g., corresponding or alternate interior angles), then \(m \angle 7 = 42\). However, this does not match any of the answer choices except for option A, which is not the closest to 138.

7. **Reassess and Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of 138 degrees for supplementary angles matches option D.
   - Other configurations (e.g., equal angles) do not provide a closer match to the answer choices.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the assumption that \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are supplementary, the measure of \(\angle 7\) is 138 degrees.

**Solution:**

Given the assumption that \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are supplementary, we calculated:

\[
m \angle 7 = 180^\circ - m \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

This matches answer choice D. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D
