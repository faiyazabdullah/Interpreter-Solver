**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC \) being a right angle.
- The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal in length.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]
- Given \( AB = BC \), let \( AB = BC = x \).
- Therefore, \( AC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 \).

**Step 3: Explore the Problem**

- We need to find the value of \( x \) such that:
  \[
  AC^2 = 2x^2
  \]
- We are given that:
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]
  which simplifies to:
  \[
  AC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
  \]

**Step 4: Verify and Calculate**

- We need to find \( x \) such that \( AC^2 = 2x^2 \).
- We are given a list of answer choices: 14.4, 18, 22.5, 24.
- We need to find which value of \( x \) makes \( AC^2 = 2x^2 \) a perfect square.

**Step 5: Calculate \( AC \) for Each Choice**

- **Choice A: \( x = 14.4 \)**
  \[
  AC^2 = 2 \times (14.4)^2 = 2 \times 207.36 = 414.72
  \]
  \( AC \) is not a perfect square.

- **Choice B: \( x = 18 \)**
  \[
  AC^2 = 2 \times (18)^2 = 2 \times 324 = 648
  \]
  \( AC \) is not a perfect square.

- **Choice C: \( x = 22.5 \)**
  \[
  AC^2 = 2 \times (22.5)^2 = 2 \times 506.25 = 1012.5
  \]
  \( AC \) is not a perfect square.

- **Choice D: \( x = 24 \)**
  \[
  AC^2 = 2 \times (24)^2 = 2 \times 576 = 1152
  \]
  \( AC = \sqrt{1152} = 24\sqrt{2} \), which is a valid length for the hypotenuse.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**

- The calculation for \( x = 24 \) results in a valid hypotenuse length.
- \( AC = 24\sqrt{2} \) is consistent with the properties of a right triangle where the legs are equal.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- The closest and most consistent choice based on the calculations is \( x = 24 \).

**Step 8: Conclusion**

- The correct answer, based on the calculations and the given constraints, is \( x = 24 \).

Final Answer: D
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints of the problem, we have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC \) as the right angle and \( AB = BC \). The hypotenuse \( AC \) satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 2x^2
\]

We calculated \( AC^2 \) for each choice:

- For \( x = 24 \), \( AC^2 = 1152 \), which is consistent with \( AC = 24\sqrt{2} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
