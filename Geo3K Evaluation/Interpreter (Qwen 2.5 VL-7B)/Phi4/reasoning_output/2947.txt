**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**
- We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal in length.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Summarize the relevant findings**
- Since \( AB = BC \) and \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles right triangle.
- In an isosceles right triangle, the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by the Pythagorean theorem: if the legs are of length \( x \), then the hypotenuse \( AC \) is \( x\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 3: Brainstorm new ideas**
- We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \) in terms of \( x \).
- Given that \( AB = BC = x \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AC \).

**Step 4: Apply relevant geometric theorems**
- By the Pythagorean theorem: 
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
  \]
- Therefore, \( AC = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 5: Verify the accuracy of the current steps**
- We have correctly applied the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle.
- The relationship \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) is consistent with the properties of such triangles.

**Step 6: Reassess and refine any errors**
- There are no errors in the application of the theorem.
- The calculation \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) is correct.

**Step 7: Revisit previous steps**
- Ensure all assumptions and calculations align with the given constraints.
- The constraints \( AB = BC \) and \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \) are consistently applied.

**Step 8: Compare calculated result with answer choices**
- We need to express \( x \) in terms of the given answer choices.
- Since \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \), we need to find \( x \) such that \( AC \) matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 9: Solve for \( x \) using the given answer choices**
- Assume \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) matches one of the answer choices.
- Test each choice to find a consistent value for \( x \).

**Step 10: Calculation**
- Assume \( AC = 18\sqrt{6} \) (choice B).
- Then \( x\sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{6} \).
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{18\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{2}} = 18 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{6}{2}} = 18 \cdot \sqrt{3}
  \]
- Calculate \( x \):
  \[
  x = 18\sqrt{3}
  \]
- Check if \( x = 18\sqrt{3} \) satisfies \( AC = 18\sqrt{6} \):
  \[
  AC = x\sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{6}
  \]
- This matches choice B.

**Step 11: Finalize the solution**
- The calculations confirm that choice B is consistent with the given constraints.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the length \( x \) that satisfies the conditions is such that \( AC = 18\sqrt{6} \), which corresponds to choice B.
