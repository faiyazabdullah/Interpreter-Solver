### Analysis of the Given Problem

1. **Understand the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle QTS \) with points \( Q \), \( T \), and \( S \).
   - The lines \( QT \), \( TS \), and \( QS \) are sides of the triangle.
   - It is given that:
     - \( \text{Length}(QT) = \text{Length}(TS) = \text{Length}(QS) \).

2. **Identify the Type of Triangle:**
   - Since all three sides are equal, \( \triangle QTS \) is an equilateral triangle.

3. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find \( x \), which is presumably related to the side length of the equilateral triangle.

4. **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are \( 60^\circ \).
   - If \( x \) represents the side length, then each side \( QT = TS = QS = x \).

5. **Consider Possible Interpretations of \( x \):**
   - Since the problem does not specify what \( x \) directly represents, it is reasonable to assume \( x \) is the side length of the equilateral triangle.

6. **Explore Possible Values for \( x \):**
   - The problem provides answer choices: 5, 7, 13, and 14.
   - Since \( x \) is a side length, it must be a positive number.

7. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - There are no additional constraints or equations provided that would allow us to calculate \( x \) directly.
   - We must choose the most reasonable value for the side length of an equilateral triangle from the given options.

8. **Select the Closest Value:**
   - Without additional context, any of the given values could theoretically be the side length of an equilateral triangle.
   - We should select the value that seems most reasonable or typical for a problem like this, given no further constraints.

9. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Since no additional information is provided, and all options are valid side lengths for an equilateral triangle, we choose the smallest positive integer value, which is often a common choice in such problems unless otherwise specified.

10. **Final Decision:**
    - Choose the smallest value from the options: 5.

</think>

<Solution>
Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the side length \( x \) of the equilateral triangle \( \triangle QTS \) can be any positive number. Among the provided answer choices, the smallest and most typical choice for a side length in such a context is 5. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
