**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**
- We have a rectangle \(EFGH\), which implies that all internal angles are 90 degrees, and opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Point \(L\) is such that \(EL\) is parallel to \(FG\), making \(ELFG\) a parallelogram (or a rectangle if \(EL = FG\)).
- Lines \(EC\) and \(CH\) are perpendicular, and both lines form right angles with \(AH\).
- Since \(EC\) is perpendicular to \(AH\) and \(CH\) is also perpendicular to \(AH\), points \(E, C, H\) lie on a vertical line, and points \(A, H\) lie on a horizontal line.
- The lengths \(EF\) and \(EL\) are equal.

**Step 2: Identifying What Needs to be Found**
- We need to find the area of quadrilateral \(EFGH\).

**Step 3: Applying Geometric Properties and Theorems**
- Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, its area can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
  \]
- From the given, \(EF = EL\). Therefore, \(EF = FG\) because \(EFGH\) is a rectangle and opposite sides are equal.
- Since \(ELFG\) is a parallelogram and \(EF = EL\), it is also a rectangle. Thus, \(EL = FG\).

**Step 4: Calculating the Area**
- Let \(EF = EL = x\).
- Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(FG = EH = x\).
- The area of rectangle \(EFGH\) is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = EF \times FG = x \times x = x^2
  \]

**Step 5: Considering Additional Information**
- Since \(EC\) and \(CH\) are perpendicular and form right angles with \(AH\), and given the symmetry and equal lengths, \(EH\) and \(FG\) are also equal to \(x\).
- The configuration suggests that \(EFGH\) might be a square, but we need to confirm this with the given options.

**Step 6: Matching with Answer Choices**
- We need to find \(x^2\) such that it matches one of the given options.
- The options are 31.5, 63, 126, and 252.
- Since \(x^2\) must be a perfect square or close to one, we test these values:
  - \(x^2 = 63\) is the closest to a reasonable square of a side length for a rectangle with integer or simple fractional dimensions.

**Step 7: Verification and Conclusion**
- If \(x^2 = 63\), then \(x \approx \sqrt{63} \approx 7.94\).
- This value is reasonable for a side length of a rectangle with integer dimensions.
- Therefore, the area of quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is approximately 63.
