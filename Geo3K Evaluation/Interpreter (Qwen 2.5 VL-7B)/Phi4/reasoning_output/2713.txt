**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\). The properties of a parallelogram include:
- Opposite sides are equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary.

The constraints provided are:
- \(AB = CD\), \(BC = DA\)
- \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA\), \(\angle BDC = \angle CDA\)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

We need to find \(m \angle CDF\). However, point \(F\) is not defined in the given constraints. This suggests that \(F\) might be a point on the extension of one of the sides or diagonals of the parallelogram.

**Step 3: Consider Possible Locations for Point \(F\)**

Since \(F\) is not defined, let's consider common scenarios:
- \(F\) could be on the extension of line \(CD\).
- \(F\) could be on the extension of line \(DA\).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

Assume \(F\) is on the extension of \(CD\). In this case, \(CDF\) forms a straight line, making \(\angle CDF\) supplementary to \(\angle CDA\).

Given:
- \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA\)
- \(\angle BDC = \angle CDA\)

Since \(\angle BDC = \angle CDA\), and \(\angle BDC\) is an interior angle of the parallelogram, it is supplementary to \(\angle CDA\).

**Step 5: Calculate \(m \angle CDA\)**

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary:
\[
\angle ABC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ
\]

Given \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA\), let \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA = x\).

Thus:
\[
x + \angle BCD = 180^\circ
\]

Since \(\angle BDC = \angle CDA = x\), and \(\angle BDC\) is supplementary to \(\angle CDA\):
\[
x + x = 180^\circ \implies 2x = 180^\circ \implies x = 90^\circ
\]

**Step 6: Determine \(m \angle CDF\)**

If \(F\) is on the extension of \(CD\), then:
\[
m \angle CDF = 180^\circ - m \angle CDA = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ
\]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated \(m \angle CDF = 90^\circ\) does not match any of the given choices directly. We need to select the closest option.

The closest option to \(90^\circ\) is \(D. 77\).

**Step 8: Conclusion**

Based on the calculations and the closest match, the answer is:
Final Answer: D

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the properties of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) and given constraints.
2. Identify that \(F\) is likely on the extension of \(CD\).
3. Use the property that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
4. Calculate \(m \angle CDA = 90^\circ\).
5. Determine \(m \angle CDF = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\).
6. Compare with answer choices and select the closest: \(D. 77\).
