**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
- \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( AB = BC \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the length of \( AC \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB = BC \), it is an isosceles right triangle. In an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

For a right triangle:
\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
\]

Since \( AB = BC \), let \( AB = BC = x \).

\[
AC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
\]

\[
AC = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}
\]

**Step 5: Consider the Similarity of Polygons**

The problem states that each pair of polygons is similar, but since we are only dealing with a single triangle here, this information might be redundant or imply that the triangle's properties are consistent with similar triangles.

**Step 6: Calculate \( AC \) Using Given Choices**

We need to find \( AC \) in terms of the given choices. Since \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \), we need to find \( x \) such that \( x\sqrt{2} \) matches one of the given choices.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

Let's test the answer choices by assuming \( x \) values that make \( x\sqrt{2} \) close to the choices:

- If \( x = 7 \), then \( AC = 7\sqrt{2} \approx 9.9 \).
- If \( x = 7.6 \), then \( AC = 7.6\sqrt{2} \approx 10.75 \).
- If \( x = 12 \), then \( AC = 12\sqrt{2} \approx 16.97 \).
- If \( x = 19 \), then \( AC = 19\sqrt{2} \approx 26.87 \).

The closest value to one of the answer choices is when \( x = 12 \), giving \( AC \approx 16.97 \), which rounds to 19.

**Step 8: Verify and Select the Closest Answer**

Given the calculations, the closest answer choice to \( 16.97 \) is 19.

**Step 9: Final Answer**

Final Answer: D
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( AB = BC \) and \( AC \) as the hypotenuse, we determined that \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) where \( x = AB = BC \). By testing the values, we found that \( x = 12 \) gives \( AC \approx 16.97 \), which is closest to 19. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
