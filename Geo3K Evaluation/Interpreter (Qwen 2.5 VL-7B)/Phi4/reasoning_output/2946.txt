1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a kite \(FGHJ\).
   - The given angles are:
     - \(\angle GFH = 128^\circ\)
     - \(\angle GJF = 72^\circ\)
     - \(\angle GFJ = 80^\circ\)

2. **Properties of a Kite:**
   - A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. This implies that \(FG = FH\) and \(GJ = HJ\).
   - The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular to each other, and one of the diagonals bisects the other.

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle GFJ\).

4. **Check Consistency and Use Known Angles:**
   - Given \(\angle GFJ = 80^\circ\), this seems to be directly provided.
   - Verify if there is any need for further calculation or if there's a misunderstanding.

5. **Apply Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \(\angle GFJ\) is given as \(80^\circ\), we need to ensure this is consistent with the properties of a kite.
   - In a kite, the angles between unequal sides are equal. Here, \(\angle GFH\) and \(\angle GJF\) are not between equal sides, so they don't need to be equal.

6. **Reassess the Given Information:**
   - The problem directly provides \(\angle GFJ = 80^\circ\).
   - No additional calculation is needed since the angle is directly given.

7. **Reflect on the Problem:**
   - The problem might be testing understanding of kite properties and direct use of given information.
   - No contradiction in the given angles with kite properties.

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated or given \(\angle GFJ = 80^\circ\).
   - This matches option B.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the given information and properties of a kite, \(\angle GFJ\) is directly provided as \(80^\circ\).
   - No further calculation is necessary.
</think>

**Solution:**
- The measure of \(\angle GFJ\) is directly given as \(80^\circ\).
- This matches with option B.
