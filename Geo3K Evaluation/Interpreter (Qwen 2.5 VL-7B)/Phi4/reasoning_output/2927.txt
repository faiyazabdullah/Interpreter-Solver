### Step 1: Analyze the Problem
- We have two trapezoids, \(JKLM\) and \(QRST\), which are similar. This implies that their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
- The area of trapezoid \(JKLM\) is given as 138 square feet, and the area of trapezoid \(QRST\) is given as 5.52 square feet.
- We are tasked to find the value of \(x\), which likely represents the scale factor of similarity between the trapezoids.

### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Geometric Properties
- For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
- Let the ratio of corresponding side lengths be \(r\). Then, the ratio of the areas will be \(r^2\).

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
- The ratio of the areas of the trapezoids is \(\frac{5.52}{138}\).
- Since the trapezoids are similar, this area ratio is equal to \(r^2\).

### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Areas
- Calculate \(\frac{5.52}{138}\):
  \[
  \frac{5.52}{138} = 0.04
  \]

### Step 5: Solve for the Scale Factor \(r\)
- Since \(r^2 = 0.04\), solve for \(r\):
  \[
  r = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2
  \]

### Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated scale factor \(r\) is 0.2.
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 0.2, B. 1, C. 25, D. 125.
- The closest and exact match is option A.

### Step 7: Finalize the Solution
- The value of \(x\), representing the scale factor \(r\), is 0.2.

**Solution:**

Given that the trapezoids \(JKLM\) and \(QRST\) are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Calculating the ratio of the areas, we have:

\[
\frac{\text{Area of } QRST}{\text{Area of } JKLM} = \frac{5.52}{138} = 0.04
\]

Since this area ratio equals \(r^2\), we solve for \(r\):

\[
r^2 = 0.04 \implies r = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2
\]

Thus, the scale factor \(x\) is 0.2, which corresponds to answer choice A.
