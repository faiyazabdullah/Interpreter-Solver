**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given two shapes: a rectangle \(JKLM\) and a rhombus \(MLPR\).
- In the rectangle \(JKLM\), \( \angle JMK \cong \angle RPM \).
- Measure of \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ \) and \( \angle RPM = 70^\circ \).
- Both \( \angle JMK \) and \( \angle RPM \) are right angles, implying there's a potential misunderstanding or typo in the problem because right angles measure \(90^\circ\).
- Opposite angles in a rectangle are equal.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- The given angles \( \angle JMK \) and \( \angle RPM \) being congruent contradicts the given measures of \(55^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\), respectively. This suggests a need to revisit the interpretation of the problem.
- Since \( \angle JMK \) and \( \angle RPM \) are both right angles, their measures should be \(90^\circ\).
- The problem states \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ\), which contradicts it being a right angle. This suggests a potential error in the problem statement or a misunderstanding.

**Step 3: Brainstorm and Explore**

- Since \( \angle JMK \) is part of rectangle \(JKLM\), and rectangles have right angles, \( \angle JMK \) should be \(90^\circ\).
- In rhombus \(MLPR\), diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, \( \angle RMP = 90^\circ\).
- The problem states \( \angle RPM = 70^\circ\), which is inconsistent with \( \angle RMP = 90^\circ\).

**Step 4: Reassess and Reflect**

- Given the contradictions, assume \( \angle JMK \) and \( \angle RPM \) are indeed \(90^\circ\) as per their properties in a rectangle and rhombus.
- \( \angle KML \) is part of the rectangle, and since \( \angle JMK = 90^\circ\), the adjacent angle \( \angle KML \) must satisfy \( \angle JMK + \angle KML = 180^\circ\).

**Step 5: Calculate \( \angle KML \)**

- Since \( \angle JMK = 90^\circ\), \( \angle KML = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( \angle KML = 90^\circ\) does not match any of the given answer choices.
- Re-evaluate the problem constraints: \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ\) and \( \angle RPM = 70^\circ\) are given, but they should be \(90^\circ\).
- Consider the possibility of a misinterpretation or error in the problem statement regarding angle measures.

**Step 7: Choose the Closest Answer**

- Given the constraints and the closest logical deduction, \( \angle KML\) should be calculated based on the correct interpretation of the problem.
- If \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ\), then \( \angle KML = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ\).
- Since \( \angle RPM = 70^\circ\) and is part of the rhombus, the closest logical deduction for \( \angle KML\) based on the given constraints is \(110^\circ\) (since \(125^\circ\) is not an option).

**Step 8: Final Decision**

- The closest match to the logical deduction based on the problem's constraints and potential errors is \(110^\circ\).

<Solution>

1. **Analyze the Geometry:**
   - \(JKLM\) is a rectangle, so \( \angle JMK = 90^\circ\).
   - \(MLPR\) is a rhombus, so diagonals bisect at right angles, making \( \angle RMP = 90^\circ\).

2. **Reconcile Given Measures:**
   - Given \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ\) contradicts it being a right angle.
   - Given \( \angle RPM = 70^\circ\) contradicts it being a right angle.

3. **Calculate \( \angle KML\):**
   - Assuming \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ\), then \( \angle KML = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ\).
   - Given the constraints and potential errors, the closest logical deduction is \(110^\circ\).

4. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer choice to the logical deduction is \(110^\circ\).
