**Thought Section**

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given a square inscribed in a circle with an area of \(18\pi\) square units.
- The square is inscribed, meaning its vertices lie on the circle.
- The circle's center \(O\) is also the center of the square.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the length of a side of the square.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- The area of the circle is given by the formula \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius.
- From the problem, \(\pi r^2 = 18\pi\). Solving for \(r\), we get:
  \[
  r^2 = 18 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
  \]
- The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the diagonal \(d\) of the square is \(2r\).
- Calculate the diagonal:
  \[
  d = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Relate the Diagonal to the Side of the Square**
- For a square with side length \(s\), the diagonal \(d\) is given by \(d = s\sqrt{2}\).
- Set the expressions for the diagonal equal:
  \[
  s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Solve for \(s\):
  \[
  s = 6
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated side length of the square is \(6\).
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 3
  - B. \(3\sqrt{2}\)
  - C. 6
  - D. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
- The calculated side length \(6\) matches choice C.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**
- The calculations are consistent with the geometric properties and constraints given.
- The closest and exact match to the calculated side length is choice C.

**Solution Section**

The side length of the square inscribed in the circle is calculated as follows:
1. The radius of the circle is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
2. The diagonal of the square, which is the diameter of the circle, is \(6\sqrt{2}\).
3. Using the relationship \(s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\), solve for \(s\) to find \(s = 6\).

Thus, the length of a side of the square is \(6\).
