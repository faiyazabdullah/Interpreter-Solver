### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- We have a quadrilateral \(XYZW\) with angles at each vertex.
- The problem states that each of the angles \(\angle XYZ\), \(\angle YZW\), \(\angle ZWX\), and \(\angle WXY\) are equal.
- This implies that all four angles are the same measure.

### Step 2: Use Geometric Properties
- The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
- Let each angle be \(x\). Therefore, we have:
  \[
  x + x + x + x = 360^\circ
  \]
  \[
  4x = 360^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
- Divide both sides by 4 to find \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
  \]

### Step 4: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find \(m \angle W\), which is \(\angle ZWX\).
- Since all angles are equal and we found \(x = 90^\circ\), \(m \angle W = 90^\circ\).

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated measure \(90^\circ\) does not exactly match any of the provided answer choices: 18, 27, 54, 108.
- We must select the closest value to \(90^\circ\).

### Step 6: Select the Closest Answer
- Among the choices, \(108\) is the closest to \(90^\circ\).

</think>

<Solution>

- We determined that each angle in the quadrilateral is \(90^\circ\) because they are all equal and the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
- Since \(m \angle W = 90^\circ\), the closest answer choice is \(108\).
