**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have a circle centered at point \( B \).
- There are points \( M, N, L, \) and \( P \) on or related to these lines and angles.
- Two lines are mentioned: \( \overline{MNL} \) and \( \overline{MNP} \), which indicate that points \( M, N, L, \) and \( P \) are collinear in different configurations.
- \( \angle MNL \) and \( \angle LNP \) are mentioned, with \( \angle LNP \) being a right angle.
- \( \overline{PN} \) is a line segment.
- \( \angle MPN \) is another angle of interest.
- The sum of the measures of \( \angle MNL \), \( \angle LNP \), and \( \angle MPN \) is given.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find \( m \widehat{LP} \), which is the measure of the arc \( LP \) on the circle centered at \( B \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( \angle LNP \) is a right angle, \( m \angle LNP = 90^\circ \).
- The sum of the measures of \( \angle MNL \), \( \angle LNP \), and \( \angle MPN \) is equal to \( 180^\circ \) because they form a straight line (as \( M, N, L, \) and \( P \) are collinear in some configurations).

**Step 4: Calculate the Unknown Angles**

- Let \( m \angle MNL = x \) and \( m \angle MPN = y \).
- We know:
  \[
  x + 90^\circ + y = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  x + y = 90^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Consider the Arc \( LP \)**

- Since \( \angle LNP \) is a right angle, and \( N \) is on the circle, \( \overline{LN} \) and \( \overline{NP} \) are radii of the circle.
- The arc \( LP \) subtended by the right angle \( \angle LNP \) is \( 180^\circ \) because a right angle inscribed in a semicircle subtends a semicircle.

**Step 6: Verify Calculations and Consider Closest Answer**

- The measure of arc \( LP \) is \( 180^\circ \) due to the right angle at \( N \).
- Compare \( 180^\circ \) with the given answer choices: \( 114^\circ, 144^\circ, 150^\circ, \) and \( 156^\circ \).
- The closest value to \( 180^\circ \) is \( 156^\circ \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Based on the analysis, the closest answer to \( 180^\circ \) is \( 156^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution**

Given the geometric constraints and the properties of angles and arcs in a circle, the measure of the arc \( LP \) subtended by the right angle \( \angle LNP \) is \( 180^\circ \). The closest answer choice to \( 180^\circ \) is \( 156^\circ \).
