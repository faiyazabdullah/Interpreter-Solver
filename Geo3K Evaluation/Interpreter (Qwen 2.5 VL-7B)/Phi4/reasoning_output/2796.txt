1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle defined by points A, B, and Y, which means these points lie on the circumference of the circle with some center, possibly not explicitly given.
   - Angles are defined at point A: \(\angle A Y B\) and \(\angle A X W\).
   - Lines intersect at point A: \( \overline{A X} \), \( \overline{A W} \).
   - Point Z lies on line \( \overline{A X} \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{Y X Z} \). This is the arc between points Y, X, and Z on the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The measure of an arc in a circle is related to the central angle that subtends the arc.
   - If \(\angle A Y B\) and \(\angle A X W\) are given, we can use them to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{Y B} \) and \( \widehat{X W} \).
   - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.

4. **Consider the Given Angles and Lines:**
   - Since \( \overline{A X} \) and \( \overline{A W} \) intersect at A, and Z lies on \( \overline{A X} \), Z is collinear with A and X.
   - The measure of \(\angle A Y B\) gives the measure of arc \( \widehat{Y B} \).
   - The measure of \(\angle A X W\) gives the measure of arc \( \widehat{X W} \).

5. **Calculate the Arc Measure:**
   - If \(\angle A Y B\) is given, say \(m\angle A Y B = \theta_1\), then \(m \widehat{Y B} = \theta_1\).
   - If \(\angle A X W\) is given, say \(m\angle A X W = \theta_2\), then \(m \widehat{X W} = \theta_2\).
   - To find \(m \widehat{Y X Z}\), we need to consider the arcs from Y to X and then from X to Z.
   - Since Z is on \( \overline{A X} \), the arc \( \widehat{X Z} \) is part of the arc \( \widehat{X W}\).

6. **Combine the Arc Measures:**
   - \(m \widehat{Y X Z} = m \widehat{Y X} + m \widehat{X Z}\).
   - \(m \widehat{Y X} = \theta_1 - \theta_2\) (assuming X is between Y and B on the circle).
   - \(m \widehat{X Z}\) is part of \(m \widehat{X W}\), but without specific values, assume \(m \widehat{X Z} = \theta_2\).

7. **Reassess and Verify:**
   - Without specific angle measures, assume typical values or relationships.
   - If \(\theta_1 = 180^\circ\) (a semicircle assumption for simplicity) and \(\theta_2 = 34^\circ\), then:
     - \(m \widehat{Y X} = 180^\circ - 34^\circ = 146^\circ\).
     - \(m \widehat{X Z} = 34^\circ\).
     - \(m \widehat{Y X Z} = 146^\circ + 34^\circ = 180^\circ\).

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(m \widehat{Y X Z} = 180^\circ\) is not directly an option.
   - Choose the closest option to 180째 from the given choices: 145, 166, 194, 215.
   - The closest value to 180째 is 166째.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the closest approximation, select the answer choice that is nearest to the calculated value.

Solution:
- The measure of \(m \widehat{Y X Z}\) is closest to 166째.
Final Answer: B
