**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given a rectangle ABCD with right angles at A, B, C, and D.
- The sides are AB, BC, CD, and DA.
- It is specified that \( \text{LengthOf}(AD) = \text{LengthOf}(CB) \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(DC) = \text{LengthOf}(BA) \).
- These conditions confirm that opposite sides of the rectangle are equal.

**Step 2: Understand the Equation**

- We have the equation \( 3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \).
- We also have the condition: \( \text{LengthOf}(AD) - \text{LengthOf}(DC) = \text{LengthOf}(CB) - \text{LengthOf}(BA) \).

**Step 3: Relate Geometric Properties to the Equation**

- Let \( \text{LengthOf}(AD) = \text{LengthOf}(CB) = l_1 \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(DC) = \text{LengthOf}(BA) = l_2 \).
- The condition becomes \( l_1 - l_2 = l_1 - l_2 \), which is trivially true and doesn't provide new information.

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**

- From \( 3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
  \[
  3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \implies 2y = 3x + 12 \implies y = \frac{3x + 12}{2}
  \]

**Step 5: Use the Length Difference Condition**

- The condition \( l_1 - l_2 = l_1 - l_2 \) doesn't directly help, but it implies \( l_1 = l_2 \) since the equation is always true.
- This implies \( l_1 = l_2 \), meaning the rectangle is actually a square.

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \) Using the Equation**

- Since \( l_1 = l_2 \), the equation \( 3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \) simplifies to:
  \[
  3x + 11 = 2\left(\frac{3x + 12}{2}\right) - 1
  \]
  \[
  3x + 11 = 3x + 12 - 1
  \]
  \[
  3x + 11 = 3x + 11
  \]

- This confirms the equation holds for any \( x \), but we need to find a specific \( x \) that fits the context of the problem.

**Step 7: Consider the Answer Choices**

- Since the equation holds for any \( x \), we need to choose the closest \( x \) from the given options.
- The equation \( 3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \) simplifies to \( y = \frac{3x + 12}{2} \).
- We need to find \( x \) such that \( y \) is an integer (since lengths are typically integers).

**Step 8: Check Each Answer Choice**

- For \( x = 9.5 \):
  \[
  y = \frac{3(9.5) + 12}{2} = \frac{28.5 + 12}{2} = \frac{40.5}{2} = 20.25
  \]
  \( y \) is not an integer.

- For \( x = 10.5 \):
  \[
  y = \frac{3(10.5) + 12}{2} = \frac{31.5 + 12}{2} = \frac{43.5}{2} = 21.75
  \]
  \( y \) is not an integer.

- For \( x = 12.5 \):
  \[
  y = \frac{3(12.5) + 12}{2} = \frac{37.5 + 12}{2} = \frac{49.5}{2} = 24.75
  \]
  \( y \) is not an integer.

- For \( x = 13.5 \):
  \[
  y = \frac{3(13.5) + 12}{2} = \frac{40.5 + 12}{2} = \frac{52.5}{2} = 26.25
  \]
  \( y \) is not an integer.

**Step 9: Choose the Closest Integer Solution**

- Since none of the values make \( y \) an integer, we choose the \( x \) that makes \( y \) closest to an integer.
- \( x = 10.5 \) gives \( y = 21.75 \), which is closest to an integer compared to other options.

</think>

**Solution:**

- The closest integer solution for \( y \) occurs when \( x = 10.5 \).
- Therefore, the best choice is \( x = 10.5 \).
