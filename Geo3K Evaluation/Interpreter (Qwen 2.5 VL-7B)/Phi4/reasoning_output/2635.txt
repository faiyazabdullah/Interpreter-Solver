**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and information.**
- We have a right triangle ADE with a right angle at D.
- Line AD and DE are the legs of the triangle, while AE is the hypotenuse.
- The lengths of AD and DE are equal: \( \text{Length of } AD = \text{Length of } DE \).
- Given: \( DE = 7 \).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**
- We need to find \( T \times X \), where \( T \) is the length of AD and \( DE = 7 \).
- Given \( EX = 24 \), but it's not immediately clear how \( EX \) relates to the triangle unless it's a part of a similar setup or extension.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems, properties, and formulas.**
- Using the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangle ADE:
  \[
  \text{Square of } AE = \text{Square of } AD + \text{Square of } DE
  \]
  \[
  AE^2 = AD^2 + DE^2
  \]
- Since \( AD = DE = 7 \):
  \[
  AE^2 = 7^2 + 7^2 = 49 + 49 = 98
  \]
  \[
  AE = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Incorporate the additional information \( EX = 24 \).**
- We need to clarify how \( EX \) fits into the problem, since it's not part of the direct triangle measurements.
- Consider the possibility that \( EX \) is a measurement related to extending or a segment associated with point E, such as a perpendicular or a continuation of the setup.

**Step 5: Explore the possibility of a larger geometric structure.**
- Since \( EX = 24 \) is given, consider a scenario where \( EX \) is part of another right triangle or a similar triangle setup.
- Assume \( EX \) is perpendicular to \( DE \) or another segment, forming a right triangle with \( DE \).

**Step 6: Reassess and refine the approach.**
- If \( EX \) is perpendicular to \( DE \), then consider a right triangle \( DEX \) where \( DE = 7 \) and \( EX = 24 \).
- Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle \( DEX \):
  \[
  DX^2 = DE^2 + EX^2
  \]
  \[
  DX^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625
  \]
  \[
  DX = \sqrt{625} = 25
  \]

**Step 7: Reflect on the calculations and verify.**
- The length \( DX = 25 \) is a significant result, suggesting that \( T \times X \) could relate to this length.
- Since \( T = AD = 7 \), and \( X \) could be interpreted as the length \( DX \) in this context, \( T \times X = 7 \times 25 = 175 \).

**Step 8: Compare with answer choices and select the closest one.**
- The calculated \( T \times X = 175 \) does not match any given answer choices directly.
- Re-evaluate the context: \( T \times X \) might refer to a simpler interpretation, such as \( T = 7 \) and \( X = 25 \) directly from the triangle \( DEX \).
- The closest match to the choices given is \( 25 \).

**Final Conclusion:**
- The correct answer choice, based on the closest match to the calculated result, is \( C. 25 \).
