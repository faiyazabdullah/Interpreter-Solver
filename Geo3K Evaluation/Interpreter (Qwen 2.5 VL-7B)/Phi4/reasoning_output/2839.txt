**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a circle \( K \) with a diameter \( JL \).
- The length of the line \( JL \) is the diameter of circle \( K \).
- The measure of angle \( KJL \) is relevant, but since \( JL \) is a diameter, angle \( KJL \) is a right angle (90 degrees) by the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
- We need to find the value of \( x \) given that the area \( A \) of the shaded region is 66 cmÂ².

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find \( x \), which is likely related to the radius or diameter of the circle, as it affects the area of the shaded region.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- The area of a circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
- Since \( JL \) is the diameter, \( JL = 2r \).
- The shaded region might be a sector or segment of the circle, or a combination of shapes involving the circle.

**Step 4: Consider Possible Configurations for the Shaded Region**
- If the shaded region is a semicircle, its area would be \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).
- If the shaded region is a segment, we need to consider the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the diameter and the chord.

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of Possible Shaded Regions**
- Assume the shaded region is a semicircle:
  \[
  \text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 66 \text{ cm}^2
  \]
  \[
  \pi r^2 = 132 \text{ cm}^2
  \]
  \[
  r^2 = \frac{132}{\pi}
  \]
  \[
  r = \sqrt{\frac{132}{\pi}}
  \]

- Calculate \( r \):
  \[
  r \approx \sqrt{\frac{132}{3.1416}} \approx \sqrt{42} \approx 6.48 \text{ cm}
  \]

- Since \( JL = 2r \), \( JL \approx 2 \times 6.48 \approx 12.96 \text{ cm} \).

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Results with Answer Choices**
- The calculated diameter \( JL \approx 12.96 \text{ cm} \).
- The closest answer choice to 12.96 is 13.0.

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**
- Reassess the calculations and assumptions. The assumption of a semicircle fits the given area and the properties of the circle.
- The closest answer choice to the calculated diameter is 13.0 cm.

**Solution:**

Based on the calculations and analysis, the diameter \( JL \) is approximately 12.96 cm, which is closest to the answer choice 13.0 cm.
