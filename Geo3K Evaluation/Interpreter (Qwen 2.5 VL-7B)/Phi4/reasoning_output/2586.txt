1. **Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - The problem defines a triangle M, L, P with points M, L, and P.
   - Lines are given as ML, LP, and PM, which are the sides of the triangle.
   - It states that the lengths of ML, LP, and PM are equal: 
     - Length(ML) = Length(LP) = Length(PM).
   - This defines an equilateral triangle, where all sides are equal and all angles are equal (each being 60 degrees).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The question asks us to find the value of \( x \). However, there is no direct mention of \( x \) in the constraints. We need to infer what \( x \) could represent based on standard geometric properties of an equilateral triangle.

3. **Applying Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is 60 degrees.
   - Common values related to equilateral triangles include:
     - The ratio of the altitude to a side, which is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
     - The ratio of the circumradius (R) to a side (s), which is \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \).
     - The ratio of the inradius (r) to a side (s), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \).

4. **Brainstorming Possible Representations of \( x \):**
   - \( x \) could represent a ratio involving the sides, altitudes, medians, or other notable segments of the triangle.
   - Given the answer choices (0.8, 1, 1.4, 1.6), \( x \) is likely a simple ratio or a value derived from these properties.

5. **Calculating Potential Values of \( x \):**
   - **Altitude to Side Ratio:** \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).
   - **Circumradius to Side Ratio:** \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.1547 \).
   - **Inradius to Side Ratio:** \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.2887 \).

6. **Comparing Calculated Results with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated values are approximately 0.866, 1.1547, and 0.2887.
   - The closest value to any of these is 1.1547, which is closest to 1.4 among the given choices.

7. **Reassessing and Refining:**
   - Re-evaluate the possible significance of \( x \) in the context of the problem.
   - Given the constraints and typical properties of equilateral triangles, the circumradius to side ratio is a reasonable candidate for \( x \).

8. **Final Verification:**
   - The circumradius to side ratio is indeed a standard geometric property of equilateral triangles.
   - The closest answer choice to 1.1547 is 1.4.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the most logical interpretation of \( x \) is the circumradius to side ratio of an equilateral triangle, which is approximately 1.1547. The closest answer choice to this value is 1.4. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
