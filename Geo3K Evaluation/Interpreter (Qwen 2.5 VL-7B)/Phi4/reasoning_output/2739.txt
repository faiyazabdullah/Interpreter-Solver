**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints.**
- We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- The sides \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are equal in length, which implies that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
- \(AE\) is perpendicular to \(AB\) and is equal to the height of the parallelogram.
- \(BE\) is given as equal to \(AE\).

**Step 2: Understand the properties of a rhombus.**
- In a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
- The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
- The height of the rhombus can be found using one of its sides and the perpendicular distance from the opposite side.

**Step 3: Relate the given information to find the area.**
- The area of a parallelogram (or rhombus) is given by the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]
- Here, \(AB\) can be considered as the base, and \(AE\) is the height.
- Since \(AB = BC = CD = DA\), let \(s\) be the length of each side.
- We are given that \(AE = BE\). Since \(AE\) is the height, \(BE\) is also equal to \(AE\).

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem.**
- In \(\triangle ABE\), since \(AE\) is perpendicular to \(AB\), we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2
  \]
- Given \(AE = BE\), let \(x = AE = BE\).
- Then:
  \[
  s^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
  \]
  \[
  s = \sqrt{2}x
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the area using the height.**
- The area of the rhombus is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = s \times AE = (\sqrt{2}x) \times x = \sqrt{2}x^2
  \]

**Step 6: Determine the value of \(x\).**
- We know \(AE = BE\) and \(AE\) is the height. Since \(AE = BE\), we can express \(x\) in terms of the area:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \sqrt{2}x^2
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with answer choices.**
- We need to find \(x\) such that \(\sqrt{2}x^2\) matches one of the given answer choices.
- Assume \(x^2 = k\), then:
  \[
  \sqrt{2}k = \text{Area}
  \]
- Check each option:
  - \(A. 294\): \(\sqrt{2}k = 294 \Rightarrow k = \frac{294}{\sqrt{2}} = 207.899\)
  - \(B. 315\): \(\sqrt{2}k = 315 \Rightarrow k = \frac{315}{\sqrt{2}} = 222.607\)
  - \(C. 336\): \(\sqrt{2}k = 336 \Rightarrow k = \frac{336}{\sqrt{2}} = 237.416\)
  - \(D. 357\): \(\sqrt{2}k = 357 \Rightarrow k = \frac{357}{\sqrt{2}} = 252.225\)

- Since \(k = x^2\) must be a perfect square, check which \(k\) is closest to a perfect square:
  - \(237.416\) is closest to \(256\), which is \(16^2\).

**Step 8: Verify the closest match.**
- If \(x^2 = 256\), then \(x = 16\).
- Calculate the area:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \sqrt{2} \times 256 = 362.038
  \]
- The closest area to the given options is \(336\).

**Solution:**

The area of the parallelogram is closest to \(336\).
