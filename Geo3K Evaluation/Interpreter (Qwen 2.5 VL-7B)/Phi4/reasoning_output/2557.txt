### Step 1: Analyze the Problem
The problem provides two arcs, each defined by an expression in terms of \( x \): \( \text{Arc}(3x) \) and \( \text{Arc}(5x - 12) \). The constraint states that the sum of the measures of these arcs equals the sum of their expressions, i.e., \( 3x + (5x - 12) \).

### Step 2: Summarize the Equation
We are given the equation:
\[ \text{MeasureOf(Arc(3x))} + \text{MeasureOf(Arc(5x - 12))} = 3x + (5x - 12) \]

This implies:
\[ \text{MeasureOf(Arc(3x))} = 3x \]
\[ \text{MeasureOf(Arc(5x - 12))} = 5x - 12 \]

### Step 3: Interpret the Geometry
Since the measures of the arcs are given as \( 3x \) and \( 5x - 12 \), these must represent angles in a circle. The sum of these angles equals \( 8x - 12 \).

### Step 4: Consider Possible Geometric Contexts
The sum of arc measures in a circle cannot exceed \( 360^\circ \). However, no specific circle context is given, so we assume the problem is purely algebraic.

### Step 5: Solve the Equation
The equation given is:
\[ 3x + (5x - 12) = 3x + (5x - 12) \]

This equation is trivially true for all \( x \), so we need to find \( x \) such that the expressions \( 3x \) and \( 5x - 12 \) are valid measures of arcs (i.e., non-negative).

### Step 6: Set Up Inequalities
For \( 3x \geq 0 \):
\[ x \geq 0 \]

For \( 5x - 12 \geq 0 \):
\[ 5x \geq 12 \]
\[ x \geq \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \]

### Step 7: Verify and Refine
The smallest \( x \) that satisfies both inequalities is \( x \geq 2.4 \). Since no upper bound is given, we consider the answer choices.

### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
- A. 10.25
- B. 12.75
- C. 18.75
- D. 25.5

All these values satisfy \( x \geq 2.4 \). We need to select the closest value to a meaningful context or a specific condition, but since no such condition is given, we choose the smallest valid \( x \) from the choices.

### Step 9: Select the Closest Answer
The smallest value among the choices is 10.25.

### Step 10: Conclude
Given the constraints and the lack of additional context, the closest and smallest valid \( x \) from the choices is 10.25.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. The equation \( 3x + (5x - 12) = 3x + (5x - 12) \) is trivially true for all \( x \).
2. The constraints \( 3x \geq 0 \) and \( 5x - 12 \geq 0 \) imply \( x \geq 2.4 \).
3. Among the answer choices, the smallest \( x \) that satisfies \( x \geq 2.4 \) is 10.25.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is the smallest valid \( x \) from the choices.
