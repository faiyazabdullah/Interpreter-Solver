**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**
- We have a circle with center \( O \).
- There is a point \( O \).
- An arc \( FG \) is described with endpoints \( F \) and \( G \).
- There is a right angle at \( O \).
- The measure of arc \( FG \) equals the measure of angle \( O \).

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings**
- A right angle at \( O \) implies that angle \( \angle FOQ \) (where \( Q \) is another point on the circle such that \( \angle FOQ = 90^\circ \)) is involved.
- The measure of the arc \( FG \) is equal to the measure of angle \( O \). Given the context, this is likely referring to the central angle \( \angle FOG \).

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties**
- The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Therefore, if the measure of arc \( FG \) is equal to the measure of angle \( O \), and \( \angle FOQ = 90^\circ \), then the central angle \( \angle FOG \) must also be \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 4: Determine the value of \( x \)**
- Since the measure of arc \( FG \) is equal to the measure of angle \( O \), and we have established that \( \angle FOG = 90^\circ \), it follows that the measure of arc \( FG \) is \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Compare calculated result with answer choices**
- The calculated measure of arc \( FG \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The answer choices are: A. 30, B. 35, C. 70, D. 140.
- The closest answer to \( 90^\circ \) is \( 70^\circ \).

**Step 6: Verify and refine**
- Reassess the problem constraints and calculations to ensure no misinterpretation.
- The problem states that the measure of arc \( FG \) equals the measure of angle \( O \), and given the right angle, the central angle \( \angle FOG \) must be \( 90^\circ \).
- The closest choice to \( 90^\circ \) is indeed \( 70^\circ \).

**Step 7: Revisit previous steps**
- Confirm that the interpretation of the problem and the application of geometric principles are correct.
- The problem does not specify any other angle measures or additional constraints that would alter the interpretation.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the measure of arc \( FG \) is \( 90^\circ \). Among the provided answer choices, the closest value to \( 90^\circ \) is \( 70^\circ \).
