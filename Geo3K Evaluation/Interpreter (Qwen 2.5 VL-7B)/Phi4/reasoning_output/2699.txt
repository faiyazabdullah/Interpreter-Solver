**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a circle with center \( X \).
- \( AB = 30 \) and \( CD = 30 \), indicating that both chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal in length.
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is \( 40^\circ \).
- \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of the respective arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- \( XM \) and \( XN \) are radii of the circle.
- We need to find \( ND \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( AB = CD = 30 \), and both are chords of the circle, they subtend equal arcs.
- The arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal because the chords are equal.
- \( M \) and \( N \) being midpoints of arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) implies that arcs \( AM = MB \) and \( CN = ND \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( AB = CD \) and both are equal chords, the arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal.
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is \( 40^\circ \). Since \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \), arc \( CN = ND \).
- The total measure of arc \( CD \) is twice the measure of arc \( CN \) or \( ND \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( CD \)**

- Since \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of equal arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \), arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal.
- Let the measure of arc \( AB \) (and hence \( CD \)) be \( \theta \).
- Since \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \), and \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \), \( m\widehat{CN} = m\widehat{ND} = \frac{\theta}{2} \).

**Step 5: Determine \( \theta \) Using \( m\widehat{CZ} \)**

- Arc \( CZ \) includes arc \( CN \) and some part of arc \( ZD \).
- Since \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \) and \( m\widehat{CN} = \frac{\theta}{2} \), the remaining part of arc \( CZ \) is \( m\widehat{NZ} \).
- Therefore, \( m\widehat{NZ} = 40^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \).

**Step 6: Calculate \( ND \)**

- Since \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \), \( m\widehat{ND} = \frac{\theta}{2} \).
- We know \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \), and \( m\widehat{CN} + m\widehat{NZ} = 40^\circ \).
- Since \( m\widehat{NZ} = 40^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \), and \( m\widehat{ND} = \frac{\theta}{2} \), we need to find \( \theta \).

**Step 7: Use Geometry of Circle**

- Since \( AB = CD = 30 \), and they subtend equal arcs, \( \theta = 2 \times m\widehat{CN} = 2 \times \frac{\theta}{2} = \theta \).
- The central angle \( \theta \) corresponding to chord \( CD \) can be found using the formula for chord length: \( CD = 2r \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \).
- Given \( CD = 30 \), we have \( 30 = 2r \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \).

**Step 8: Solve for \( ND \)**

- Since \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \), and \( m\widehat{CN} = \frac{\theta}{2} \), we can find \( \theta \) by considering the geometry of the circle.
- Assume \( \theta = 80^\circ \) (since \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \) and \( m\widehat{NZ} = 40^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \)).
- Then \( m\widehat{ND} = \frac{\theta}{2} = 40^\circ \).

**Step 9: Calculate Length \( ND \)**

- Using the sine rule in the triangle \( XND \), where \( \angle XND = 40^\circ \) and \( XN = r \) (radius):
  \[
  ND = 2r \sin(20^\circ)
  \]
- Since \( CD = 30 = 2r \sin(40^\circ) \), we can find \( r \) and then calculate \( ND \).

**Step 10: Final Calculation**

- From \( 30 = 2r \sin(40^\circ) \), solve for \( r \):
  \[
  r = \frac{30}{2 \sin(40^\circ)}
  \]
- Substitute \( r \) into \( ND = 2r \sin(20^\circ) \):
  \[
  ND = 2 \left(\frac{30}{2 \sin(40^\circ)}\right) \sin(20^\circ)
  \]
  \[
  ND = \frac{30 \sin(20^\circ)}{\sin(40^\circ)}
  \]

**Step 11: Approximate Calculation**

- Using approximate values: \( \sin(20^\circ) \approx 0.342 \) and \( \sin(40^\circ) \approx 0.643 \):
  \[
  ND \approx \frac{30 \times 0.342}{0.643} \approx 15.96
  \]

**Step 12: Choose the Closest Answer**

- The closest answer choice to \( 15.96 \) is \( 15 \).

</think>

**Solution**

After calculating the length \( ND \) using the sine rule and approximations, we find that \( ND \approx 15.96 \). The closest answer choice to this value is \( 15 \).
