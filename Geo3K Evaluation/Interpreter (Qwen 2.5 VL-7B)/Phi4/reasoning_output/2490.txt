**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

We are given a parallelogram ABCD with the following properties:
- Opposite sides are equal: \( AB = CD \) and \( BC = DA \).
- Opposite angles are equal: \( \angle A = \angle C \) and \( \angle B = \angle D \).

**Step 2: Identify the Given Equations**

1. \( AB = CD \) is given by the equation \( x + 4 = 3x - 6 \).
2. \( BC = DA \) is given by the equation \( 55^\circ = 60^\circ \).

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \) Using the Length Equation**

The equation for the lengths of opposite sides is:
\[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x + 4 = 3x - 6
  \]
  \[
  4 + 6 = 3x - x
  \]
  \[
  10 = 2x
  \]
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Angle Condition**

The equation \( 55^\circ = 60^\circ \) is incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, but consecutive angles are supplementary. This suggests a potential error in the problem setup or an unnecessary condition.

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

The angle condition does not affect the calculation of \( x \) since it does not involve \( x \) and is inherently incorrect for a parallelogram. The primary focus should be on the side length equation.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \( x \) is 5. We compare this with the given answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 5
- C. 12
- D. 18

The calculated value \( x = 5 \) matches choice B.

**Step 7: Final Verification**

Recheck the calculations for \( x \):
- The equation \( x + 4 = 3x - 6 \) simplifies correctly to \( x = 5 \).

Thus, the solution is consistent and correct.

</think>

**Solution:**

To find \( x \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, we solved the equation \( x + 4 = 3x - 6 \) derived from the condition \( AB = CD \). Solving this equation gave us \( x = 5 \). The angle condition \( 55^\circ = 60^\circ \) is not relevant to solving for \( x \) and is inherently incorrect for a parallelogram. Therefore, the correct choice is:

Final Answer: B
