1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We are given a geometric constraint: `SumOfAnglesOf(Q, R, S, T)`. This suggests that Q, R, S, and T are vertices of a quadrilateral.
   - In any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is always 360 degrees. This is a key geometric property that will guide the problem-solving process.

2. **Identifying What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle R\), one of the angles of the quadrilateral.

3. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - The sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees: \(\angle Q + \angle R + \angle S + \angle T = 360^\circ\).

4. **Exploring Further:**
   - We need additional information or assumptions to find the measure of \(\angle R\). However, the problem does not provide specific measures for \(\angle Q\), \(\angle S\), or \(\angle T\).
   - Without specific values, we consider the problem might be asking for a specific type of quadrilateral or a particular configuration.

5. **Assumption and Reasoning:**
   - A common scenario in problems like this is the consideration of special types of quadrilaterals such as parallelograms, rectangles, or other symmetric configurations.
   - However, without explicit information, we cannot assume specific values for \(\angle Q\), \(\angle S\), or \(\angle T\).

6. **Reassessing and Reflecting:**
   - Given the choices (58, 60, 122, 124), these values are likely to be part of a specific configuration.
   - A common angle measure that appears in such problems is 60 degrees, especially if the quadrilateral might be part of a symmetric or regular configuration.

7. **Verification and Refinement:**
   - If we assume \(\angle R = 60^\circ\), then the remaining angles \(\angle Q + \angle S + \angle T = 360^\circ - 60^\circ = 300^\circ\).
   - This is a plausible scenario if the remaining angles are distributed in a way that maintains the sum of 360 degrees.

8. **Revisiting and Iteration:**
   - Without loss of generality, and given the symmetry of the problem and the typical nature of such questions, 60 degrees is a reasonable assumption for \(\angle R\).
   - The other options (58, 122, 124) do not suggest any obvious symmetry or common configuration without additional context.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the analysis and the nature of typical geometric problems, \(\angle R = 60^\circ\) is the most reasonable choice given the options.

<Solution>
Given the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, and considering typical geometric problem configurations, the most reasonable assumption for \(\angle R\) is 60 degrees. This assumption fits well with common symmetric configurations and does not contradict any given information. Therefore, the closest and most logical choice is:
