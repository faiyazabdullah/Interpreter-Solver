**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and question.**

- We have a trapezoid \( TRSV \) with \( T, R, S, \) and \( V \) as vertices.
- \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \( RV \) and \( TS \), respectively.
- The midsegment \( MN \) is given to be parallel to the bases \( TR \) and \( SV \).
- Given lengths: \( TR = 32 \) and \( MN = 25 \).
- We need to find the length of the base \( SV \).

**Step 2: Identify relevant geometric properties and theorems.**

- In a trapezoid, the midsegment \( MN \) is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.
- This gives us the formula: 
  \[
  MN = \frac{TR + SV}{2}
  \]

**Step 3: Apply the formula to solve for \( SV \).**

- Substitute the known values into the formula:
  \[
  25 = \frac{32 + SV}{2}
  \]

- Solve for \( SV \):
  \[
  50 = 32 + SV
  \]
  \[
  SV = 50 - 32
  \]
  \[
  SV = 18
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the calculations.**

- Re-evaluate the steps to ensure no arithmetic errors were made:
  - Multiply both sides of the equation \( 25 = \frac{32 + SV}{2} \) by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
    \[
    50 = 32 + SV
    \]
  - Subtract 32 from both sides:
    \[
    SV = 18
    \]

**Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the answer choices.**

- The calculated length of \( SV \) is 18.
- Check the answer choices:
  - A. 18
  - B. 36
  - C. 50
  - D. 64
- The calculated result matches option A.

**Step 6: Conclusion and selection of the correct answer.**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the length of \( SV \) is 18.
- The closest and correct answer choice is A.

</think>

**Solution:**

By applying the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, we calculated the length of \( SV \) using the given lengths of \( TR \) and \( MN \). The formula \( MN = \frac{TR + SV}{2} \) was used, and solving for \( SV \) gave us 18. This matches option A from the provided answer choices.
