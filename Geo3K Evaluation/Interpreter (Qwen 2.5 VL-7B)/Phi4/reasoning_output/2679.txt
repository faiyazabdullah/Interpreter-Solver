**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have several points: C, E, A, B, D, F, G.
- Several lines are defined: CD, DE, BD, BG, GF, FA.
- Angle ∠BGF is specified as a right angle.
- We know that the measure of ∠BGF is equal to the measure of ∠FAD and ∠FAB.

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We need to find the value of x, which is likely related to one of the angles or measurements given the context of the geometric setup.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since ∠BGF is a right angle, ∠BGF = 90°.
- We have the equality: Measure of ∠BGF = Measure of ∠FAD = Measure of ∠FAB.
- This implies that ∠FAD = 90° and ∠FAB = 90°.

**Step 4: Consider the Implications**

- Since ∠FAB is a right angle, and it involves points F, A, and B, it suggests that line FA is perpendicular to line AB.
- The equality of angles suggests a symmetry or specific geometric configuration, possibly involving parallel lines or a specific polygon.

**Step 5: Calculate the Value of x**

- Since ∠FAB = 90°, and it is equal to x (as per the problem's implication), x = 90°.
- However, none of the answer choices directly match 90°.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to 90° is 85°, but this is not an option.
- The next closest logical choice, considering potential rounding or interpretation, is 115°.

**Step 7: Verify and Refine**

- Reassess the setup: If ∠FAB is indeed 90°, and we need to select the closest answer, 115° is the closest to 90° among the given options.
- Consider if any geometric misinterpretation could lead to a different angle, but the constraints strongly suggest 90°.

**Step 8: Final Decision**

- Based on the analysis, the closest answer to the calculated angle of 90° is 115°.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the analysis, the value of x, which corresponds to the measure of ∠FAB, is closest to 115° among the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer is:
