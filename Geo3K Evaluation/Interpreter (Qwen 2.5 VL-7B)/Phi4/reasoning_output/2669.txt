**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have two parallel lines: Line(D, E) and Line(B, C).
- There is a right angle at Angle(B, F, E).
- Point F is common to Line(B, F) and Line(E, F).
- The measure of Angle(B, F, E) is given to be a right angle.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since Angle(B, F, E) is a right angle, its measure is 90 degrees.
- The fact that Line(D, E) is parallel to Line(B, C) does not directly affect the measure of Angle(B, F, E), but it may be relevant for understanding the overall geometric configuration.

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**
- The problem asks to find "x," but does not explicitly state what "x" represents. However, given the context, it is reasonable to assume that "x" refers to the measure of Angle(B, F, E).

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps**
- We know that a right angle measures 90 degrees. This is a fundamental property of right angles.
- The given information confirms that Angle(B, F, E) is a right angle.

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**
- There are no apparent errors in the interpretation of the geometric constraints and the properties of right angles.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**
- Reassessing the constraints and the properties of right angles confirms that the measure of Angle(B, F, E) is indeed 90 degrees.

**Step 7: Finalize the Thought Process**
- Given that Angle(B, F, E) is a right angle, its measure is 90 degrees.
- Therefore, "x" should be 90 degrees.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and the properties of right angles, we determined that the measure of Angle(B, F, E) is 90 degrees. Since the problem asks for "x" and it is reasonable to assume that "x" refers to the measure of this angle, the value of "x" is 90 degrees.

Comparing this calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 45
- B. 90
- C. 180
- D. 360

The closest and correct choice is B. 90.

Final Answer: B
