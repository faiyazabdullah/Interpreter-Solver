1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a trapezoid ABCD with given points A, B, C, and D.
   - Lines AB and CD are parallel, and we need to find angle x.
   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
   - We are given that ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. We are not explicitly given the measure of these angles, but we can use the properties of trapezoids and the given information to deduce them.
   - Line AD is not parallel to BC, as it is a typical trapezoid (with only one pair of parallel sides).

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - The angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C are equal. Let’s denote their measure as x.
   - Since AB is parallel to CD, and considering the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal, ∠D and the angles at A and C are related.
   - Using the angle sum property for a quadrilateral, we have:
     \[
     \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the known equal angles:
     \[
     x + x + x + \angle D = 360^\circ
     \]
     \[
     3x + \angle D = 360^\circ
     \]

3. **Explore New Ideas:**
   - Since AB is parallel to CD, ∠D is supplementary to ∠C (or ∠A) because they are consecutive interior angles.
   - Therefore, \(\angle D = 180^\circ - x\).

4. **Verify and Refine Steps:**
   - Substitute \(\angle D = 180^\circ - x\) into the equation:
     \[
     3x + (180^\circ - x) = 360^\circ
     \]
     \[
     3x + 180^\circ - x = 360^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 90^\circ
     \]

5. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The calculated value of x is 90 degrees, which is not directly listed in the answer choices.
   - We need to choose the closest value to 90 degrees from the given options.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The options are A. 24, B. 56, C. 65, D. 115.
   - The closest value to 90 degrees is 65.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Based on the calculation, the closest answer to 90 degrees is option C, which is 65 degrees.

Solution:
Based on the analysis of the trapezoid's properties and the angle sum property, we calculated that the measure of each equal angle (x) is 90 degrees. The closest value to 90 degrees among the provided options is 65 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
