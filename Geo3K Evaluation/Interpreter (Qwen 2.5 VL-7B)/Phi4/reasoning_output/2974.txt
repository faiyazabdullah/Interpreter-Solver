1. **Analyzing the given geometric constraints:**
   - We are given a rhombus \(PQRS\) inscribed in a circle with center \(C\).
   - Rhombus implies all sides are equal: \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\).
   - A circle circumscribed around a quadrilateral implies that the quadrilateral is cyclic.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle SPC\).

3. **Summarize the relevant findings:**
   - Since \(PQRS\) is a rhombus inscribed in a circle, it is also a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, meaning \(\angle PQC = \angle QRC = \angle RSC = \angle SPC = 90^\circ\).
   - The angles \(\angle PQC\), \(\angle QRC\), \(\angle RSC\), and \(\angle SPC\) are all equal and each is a right angle.

4. **Exploration and verification:**
   - Since all four angles \(\angle PQC\), \(\angle QRC\), \(\angle RSC\), and \(\angle SPC\) are equal and the sum of angles around point \(C\) is \(360^\circ\), each of these angles must be \(90^\circ\).

5. **Reassess the problem statement and ensure understanding:**
   - The problem states that the rhombus is inscribed in a circle, and the center of the circle is the intersection of the diagonals of the rhombus. This ensures that the diagonals are diameters of the circle.
   - Therefore, \(\angle SPC\) being one of these angles is indeed \(90^\circ\).

6. **Reflection and backtracking:**
   - Re-evaluating the properties of a cyclic rhombus confirms that the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other.
   - No other configurations or properties contradict the conclusion that \(\angle SPC = 90^\circ\).

7. **Iteration and final conclusion:**
   - Based on the properties of a cyclic rhombus and the given conditions, the measure of \(\angle SPC\) is definitively \(90^\circ\).
</think>

<Solution>
Given the geometric constraints and properties of a rhombus inscribed in a circle, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This confirms that each angle formed by the diagonals at the center \(C\) is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of \(\angle SPC\) is \(90^\circ\).

Comparing this result with the provided answer choices:
- A. 30
- B. 45
- C. 60
- D. 90

The correct answer is \(90^\circ\), which corresponds to option D.

Final Answer: D
