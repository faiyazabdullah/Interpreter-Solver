**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a parallelogram PQRS with the following properties:
  - \(PQ \parallel RS\)
  - \(QR \parallel SP\)
  - \(QR = SP\)
  - \(PQ = RS\)
  - \(RS = QP\)
  - \(SR = \angle Q\)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the length of \(QP\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
  - \(PQ = RS\)
  - \(QR = SP\)

- We are given that \(RS = QP\). This implies \(QP = RS\).

- We are also given \(SR = \angle Q\). However, this seems to be a typographical error or misinterpretation, as angles are not typically equated to line lengths. We will focus on the lengths.

**Step 4: Use Given Equalities**

- From the given:
  - \(RS = QP\)
  - \(PQ = RS\)

- Therefore, \(QP = RS = PQ\).

**Step 5: Consider the Lengths**

- Since \(QP = PQ\), and we know \(PQ = RS\), we can deduce:
  - \(QP = PQ = RS\)

**Step 6: Verify the Consistency of the Information**

- All given equalities are consistent with the properties of a parallelogram:
  - \(PQ = RS\)
  - \(QR = SP\)
  - \(RS = QP\)

- Thus, \(QP = PQ = RS\).

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- We need to find the numerical value of \(QP\).
- Since \(QP = PQ = RS\), and no specific numerical values are given, we assume a unit length or a common value for these equal sides.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

- Without specific numerical values, we assume a common length for these equal sides.
- Given the answer choices, we need to select the closest possible value for \(QP\).

**Step 9: Final Decision**

- Since \(QP = PQ = RS\) and no specific numerical value is given, we assume a unit length.
- The answer choices are 3, 5, 8, and 15.
- Without loss of generality, we assume a unit length of 5 for simplicity, as it is a common choice in such problems.

Final Answer: B
