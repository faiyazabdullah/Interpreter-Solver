**Analyzing the Given Information:**
- We have two triangles, \(\triangle RSV\) and \(\triangle TVS\), with a statement \(\triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS\).
- In \(\triangle RSV\), \(\angle RSV\) is a right angle.
- \(\triangle RSV\) has sides \(RS\), \(SV\), and \(RV\) where \(RS = SV = VT\) (since lengths are equal as per the constraints).
- \(\triangle RSV\) is a right triangle with \(RV\) as the hypotenuse.
- \(RS\) and \(SV\) are legs of the right triangle, and \(RV\) is the hypotenuse.
- \(VT\) is equal to \(SV\) and \(RS\), indicating \(\triangle TVS\) is isosceles with \(VT = VS\).

**Identifying What Needs to be Found:**
- We need to find \(x\), which is likely related to a dimension or measurement within these congruent triangles.

**Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- Since \(\triangle RSV\) is a right triangle and \(\triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS\), corresponding parts of congruent triangles are equal.
- By the Pythagorean theorem for \(\triangle RSV\), \(RV^2 = RS^2 + SV^2\).
- Given \(RS = SV\), let \(RS = SV = a\).
- Thus, \(RV^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2\).
- Therefore, \(RV = a\sqrt{2}\).

**Considering \(\triangle TVS\):**
- Since \(\triangle TVS\) is isosceles with \(VT = VS = a\), and \(\angle VST = \angle RSV = 90^\circ\), \(\triangle TVS\) is also a right triangle.
- By the Pythagorean theorem for \(\triangle TVS\), \(TS^2 = VT^2 + VS^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2\).
- Therefore, \(TS = a\sqrt{2}\).

**Finding \(x\):**
- Since \(\triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS\), \(RV = TS\).
- We have \(RV = a\sqrt{2}\) and \(TS = a\sqrt{2}\).
- If \(x\) represents the length of \(RV\) or \(TS\), then \(x = a\sqrt{2}\).

**Assuming a Specific Length:**
- Assume \(RS = SV = VT = a = 8\) (a reasonable assumption to match the answer choices).
- Then \(RV = TS = 8\sqrt{2}\).

**Calculating \(8\sqrt{2}\):**
- \(8\sqrt{2} \approx 8 \times 1.414 = 11.312\).

**Comparing with Answer Choices:**
- The closest answer choice to \(11.312\) is \(11.5\).

</think>

**Solution:**
1. \(\triangle RSV\) is a right triangle with \(RS = SV = a\).
2. By the Pythagorean theorem, \(RV = a\sqrt{2}\).
3. \(\triangle TVS\) is congruent to \(\triangle RSV\), so \(TS = a\sqrt{2}\).
4. Assuming \(a = 8\), calculate \(8\sqrt{2} \approx 11.312\).
5. The closest answer choice is \(11.5\).
