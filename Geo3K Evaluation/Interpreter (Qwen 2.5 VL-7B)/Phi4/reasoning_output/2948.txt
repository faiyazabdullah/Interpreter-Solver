1. **Analyzing the Given Information**: We have two triangles, \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BDC \). It's given that \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) and \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), indicating that these lines form right angles at points \( D \) and \( A \) respectively.

2. **Identifying Right Triangles**: 
   - In \( \triangle ABD \), \( \angle ABD \) is a right angle, making \( AB \) and \( BD \) the legs, and \( AD \) the hypotenuse.
   - In \( \triangle BDC \), \( \angle BDC \) is a right angle, making \( BD \) and \( DC \) the legs, and \( BC \) the hypotenuse.

3. **Understanding Equal Lengths**:
   - We are given \( \text{Length}(AD) = \text{Length}(BD) \). This means \( \triangle ABD \) is an isosceles right triangle, where the legs \( AB \) and \( BD \) are equal.

4. **Applying Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - For \( \triangle ABD \), using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2
     \]
     Since \( AB = BD \), let \( AB = BD = x \). Then:
     \[
     AD^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
     Given \( AD = BD \), we have \( AD = x\sqrt{2} \).

5. **Analyzing \( \triangle BDC \)**:
   - Since \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( BD = AD = x\sqrt{2} \), we need to find \( BC \).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \):
     \[
     BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2
     \]
     Since \( BD = x\sqrt{2} \), we have:
     \[
     BC^2 = (x\sqrt{2})^2 + DC^2 = 2x^2 + DC^2
     \]

6. **Finding \( DC \)**:
   - Since \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) and \( AD = BD = x\sqrt{2} \), \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) in \( \triangle BDC \) because \( \triangle ABD \) is isosceles with \( AD = BD \).
   - Therefore, \( DC = BD = x\sqrt{2} \).

7. **Calculating \( BC \)**:
   - Substitute \( DC = x\sqrt{2} \) into the equation for \( BC^2 \):
     \[
     BC^2 = 2x^2 + (x\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2 + 2x^2 = 4x^2
     \]
   - Thus, \( BC = \sqrt{4x^2} = 2x \).

8. **Determining \( x \)**:
   - Since \( AD = BD = x\sqrt{2} \) and \( AD = 5 \) (from the problem's constraints), we have:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = 5 \implies x = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

9. **Calculating \( BC \) with \( x \)**:
   - Substitute \( x = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} \) into \( BC = 2x \):
     \[
     BC = 2 \times \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
     \]

10. **Comparing with Answer Choices**:
    - The calculated \( BC = 5\sqrt{2} \) matches answer choice A.

</think>
**Solution**:  
Given the geometric constraints and calculations, the length of \( BC \) is \( 5\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
