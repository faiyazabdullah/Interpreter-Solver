1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given that circle P is congruent to circle Q, which implies that their radii are equal. Therefore, we have the equation:  
   \[
   \text{Radius of Circle } P = \text{Radius of Circle } Q
   \]
   Given that the radius of Circle P is \(3x\) and the radius of Circle Q is \(7x - 44\), we set up the equation:  
   \[
   3x = 7x - 44
   \]

2. **Solving the Equation**: To find the value of \(x\), we solve the equation:
   \[
   3x = 7x - 44
   \]
   Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = 4x - 44
   \]
   Add 44 to both sides:
   \[
   44 = 4x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

3. **Verification**: We found \(x = 11\). Let's verify by substituting back into the expressions for the radii:
   - Radius of Circle P: \(3x = 3 \times 11 = 33\)
   - Radius of Circle Q: \(7x - 44 = 7 \times 11 - 44 = 77 - 44 = 33\)

   Both radii are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

4. **Comparison with Answer Choices**: The calculated value \(x = 11\) matches option B.

5. **Final Consideration**: Since the calculated value directly matches one of the answer choices, there is no need for approximation or selection of the closest value.

<Solution>
To solve for \(x\), we equated the radii of the congruent circles:
\[
3x = 7x - 44
\]
Solving the equation:
\[
3x = 7x - 44 \implies 44 = 4x \implies x = 11
\]
Verification shows that both radii are equal when \(x = 11\). Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

Final Answer: B
