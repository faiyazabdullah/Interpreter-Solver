1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a triangle \( \triangle PNM \) with points \( P \), \( N \), and \( M \).
   - The triangle is a right triangle with \( \angle PNM \) being the right angle.
   - The sides \( PN \), \( NM \), and \( PM \) are all equal in length.
   - \( NM \) is the hypotenuse, and \( PN \) and \( PM \) are the legs adjacent to the right angle at \( N \).

2. **Understand the Implications:**
   - Since \( PN = NM = PM \), this implies that the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.
   - In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg.

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( \cos N \), where \( N \) is the angle at point \( N \).

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - In a right triangle, \( \cos \) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
   - For \( \angle N \), the adjacent side is \( PN \) and the hypotenuse is \( NM \).

5. **Calculate \( \cos N \):**
   - Since \( PN = NM/\sqrt{2} \) (because \( NM = \sqrt{2} \times PN \) in an isosceles right triangle),
   - \( \cos N = \frac{PN}{NM} = \frac{PN}{\sqrt{2} \times PN} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

6. **Convert to Decimal:**
   - \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.7071 \).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( 0.7071 \) needs to be compared with the given choices: 0.38, 0.42, 0.92, and 2.40.
   - The closest value to \( 0.7071 \) is \( 0.92 \).

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Based on the comparison, the closest choice is \( 0.92 \).

<Solution>

Given the constraints and calculations, the value of \( \cos N \) for the isosceles right triangle \( \triangle PNM \) is approximately \( 0.7071 \). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \( 0.92 \).
