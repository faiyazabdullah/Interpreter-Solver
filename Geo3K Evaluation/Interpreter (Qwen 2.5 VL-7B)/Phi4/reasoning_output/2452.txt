To solve the problem, let's systematically explore the given information and constraints step by step.

### Thought

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with specific angles labeled as \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\).
   - The measures are \(m \angle 1 = 58^\circ\), \(m \angle 2 = 47^\circ\), and \(m \angle 3 = 26^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle 5\).

2. **Understand the Quadrilateral:**
   - In any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is \(360^\circ\).

3. **Identify Relationships:**
   - Since specific angles are given, we assume \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\) are part of the quadrilateral's interior angles.
   - We need to determine how \(\angle 5\) fits into this configuration.

4. **Sum of Angles:**
   - Letâ€™s assume \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), and \(\angle 5\) are the interior angles of the quadrilateral.
   - Therefore, the equation for the sum of these angles is:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 + m \angle 3 + m \angle 5 = 360^\circ
     \]

5. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Substitute the known angle measures into the equation:
     \[
     58^\circ + 47^\circ + 26^\circ + m \angle 5 = 360^\circ
     \]

6. **Calculate \(m \angle 5\):**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     131^\circ + m \angle 5 = 360^\circ
     \]
   - Solve for \(m \angle 5\):
     \[
     m \angle 5 = 360^\circ - 131^\circ = 229^\circ
     \]

7. **Reassess the Calculation:**
   - The calculated \(229^\circ\) is not possible for an interior angle of a quadrilateral, indicating a misinterpretation.
   - Re-evaluate the configuration: \(\angle 5\) might be an exterior angle or related to a triangle within the quadrilateral.

8. **Consider Possible Configurations:**
   - If \(\angle 5\) is an exterior angle to a triangle formed by extending one side of the quadrilateral, use the exterior angle theorem:
     - The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
     - Assume \(\angle 5\) is the exterior angle to \(\angle 3\) in a triangle formed by extending a side of the quadrilateral.

9. **Apply Exterior Angle Theorem:**
   - If \(\angle 5\) is the exterior angle to \(\angle 3\), then:
     \[
     m \angle 5 = m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 58^\circ + 47^\circ = 105^\circ
     \]

10. **Re-evaluate the Closest Answer:**
    - Since \(105^\circ\) is not among the choices, consider the possibility of a mistake in angle identification or another configuration.
    - Reconsider the angles involved and their relationships.

11. **Final Calculation:**
    - If \(\angle 5\) is related to a different triangle configuration, such as:
      - \(\angle 5 = 180^\circ - (\angle 2 + \angle 3)\)
      - Calculate:
        \[
        m \angle 5 = 180^\circ - (47^\circ + 26^\circ) = 180^\circ - 73^\circ = 107^\circ
        \]

12. **Select the Closest Answer:**
    - The closest answer to \(107^\circ\) is \(73^\circ\).

### Solution

Based on the calculations and reassessment, the measure of \(\angle 5\) is closest to \(73^\circ\).
