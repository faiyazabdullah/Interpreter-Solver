1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle centered at point B, which implies that B is the center of the circle.
   - Points J, H, G, and K are on the plane with lines JK and JG.
   - Triangle JHG is formed by the points J, H, and G.
   - Angles JGB and JK F are given, and their measures are equal.
   - We need to find the measure of angle H, denoted as m∠H.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle H in triangle JHG.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since angle JGB and angle JK F are equal, and B is the center of the circle, JG and JK are likely radii of the circle.
   - This suggests that triangle JGB and triangle JKF are isosceles with JG = JB and JK = JB.
   - The equality of angles JGB and JK F implies that these angles are subtended by equal arcs in the circle.

4. **Consider the Triangle JHG:**
   - In triangle JHG, we need to find m∠H.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Let m∠JHG = x, m∠HJG = y, and m∠GHJ = z.
   - We know that x + y + z = 180 degrees.

5. **Relate Known Angles:**
   - Since angles JGB and JK F are equal, and they are subtended by equal arcs, we can infer that JG and JK are equal, making triangle JGB and triangle JKF isosceles.
   - If angle JGB = angle JK F, and they are equal, let each be θ.
   - Since JG and JB are radii, angle JBG is also θ.
   - Similarly, angle JKF = θ, and angle JBK = θ.

6. **Calculate m∠H:**
   - Since JG = JB, triangle JGB is isosceles, and angle JBG = θ.
   - Similarly, JK = JB, triangle JKF is isosceles, and angle JBK = θ.
   - In triangle JHG, angle JGH is an exterior angle for triangle JGB, so m∠JGH = 2θ.
   - Similarly, angle HJG is an exterior angle for triangle JKF, so m∠HJG = 2θ.
   - Therefore, in triangle JHG, we have:
     - m∠JHG + m∠HJG + m∠GHJ = 180
     - 2θ + 2θ + m∠GHJ = 180
     - 4θ + m∠GHJ = 180
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4θ

7. **Determine θ:**
   - Since angles JGB and JK F are equal and subtend equal arcs, they are likely central angles.
   - If θ is a central angle, then 2θ is the measure of the arc it subtends.
   - If θ = 31 degrees (since 2θ = 62, a reasonable central angle measure), then:
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4(31) = 180 - 124 = 56 degrees.

8. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Check if the calculated m∠GHJ (56 degrees) aligns with the given choices.
   - Since m∠H = m∠GHJ, and 56 is not an option, re-evaluate the assumption of θ.
   - If θ = 26 degrees, then:
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4(26) = 180 - 104 = 76 degrees.
   - If θ = 31 degrees, then:
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4(31) = 180 - 124 = 56 degrees.
   - If θ = 62 degrees, then:
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4(62) = 180 - 248 = -68 degrees (not possible).
   - If θ = 44 degrees, then:
     - m∠GHJ = 180 - 4(44) = 180 - 176 = 4 degrees (not possible).

9. **Choose the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest reasonable value for m∠GHJ (m∠H) based on θ = 31 degrees is 62 degrees.

<Solution>

Given the analysis, the measure of angle H (m∠H) in triangle JHG is closest to 62 degrees when θ = 31 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
