1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a regular hexagon, which means all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal.
   - The given constraint is that each side length is equal to the length of Line(A,B).
   - We need to find the area of this regular hexagon.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the area of a regular hexagon based on the given side length, which is the same as the length of Line(A,B).

3. **Geometric Properties and Formulas:**
   - For a regular hexagon with side length \( s \), the area \( A \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from dividing the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles and calculating the area of one triangle and then multiplying by 6.

4. **Exploring the Given Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are numerical values: 12.7, 25.5, 101.8, and 203.6.
   - We need to calculate the area using the formula and compare it to these values.

5. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - Assume \( s = 1 \) for simplicity, as the exact length of Line(A,B) is not provided, but it will cancel out in the comparison.
   - Calculate the area using \( s = 1 \):
     \[
     A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 1^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3 \times 1.732}{2} \approx \frac{5.196}{2} \approx 2.598
     \]
   - This is the area for \( s = 1 \).

6. **Scaling the Area:**
   - If \( s \) is not 1, say \( s = x \), then the area becomes:
     \[
     A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} x^2
     \]
   - We need to find \( x \) such that the calculated area matches one of the given choices.

7. **Matching with Answer Choices:**
   - Assume \( A = 25.5 \) (since 12.7 seems too small for a reasonable side length):
     \[
     \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} x^2 = 25.5
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{25.5 \times 2}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{51}{5.196} \approx 9.82
     \]
     \[
     x \approx \sqrt{9.82} \approx 3.13
     \]
   - Check if this \( x \) is reasonable:
     - If \( s \approx 3.13 \), then the area calculation should be close to 25.5.

8. **Reassessing Other Choices:**
   - For \( A = 101.8 \):
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{101.8 \times 2}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{203.6}{5.196} \approx 39.2
     \]
     \[
     x \approx \sqrt{39.2} \approx 6.26
     \]
   - For \( A = 203.6 \):
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{203.6 \times 2}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{407.2}{5.196} \approx 78.4
     \]
     \[
     x \approx \sqrt{78.4} \approx 8.85
     \]

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The side length \( x \approx 3.13 \) for area 25.5 is reasonable and matches the scaling of the formula.
   - The other values seem too large for a reasonable side length given typical geometric constraints.

</think>

**Solution:**
- The area of the regular hexagon with a side length that matches one of the given choices is closest to 25.5 when the side length is approximately 3.13.
- Therefore, the area of the hexagon is best represented by choice B.

Final Answer: B.
