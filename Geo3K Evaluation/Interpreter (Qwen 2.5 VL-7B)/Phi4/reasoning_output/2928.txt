**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a right angle at \( B \), which means \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- The lengths are given as \( AB = 6 \), \( BC = 7.5 \), and \( AC = 9 \).
- Line \( AC \) is parallel to line \( DE \) and \( AC = DE = 9 \).
- Point \( F \) is on line \( AC \) such that \( BF \) bisects \( \angle ABC \).

**Step 2: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**
- The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the segments created by the bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.
- Therefore, \( \frac{AF}{FC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{6}{7.5} = \frac{4}{5} \).

**Step 3: Express \( AF \) and \( FC \) in Terms of a Variable**
- Let \( AF = 4x \) and \( FC = 5x \).
- Since \( AF + FC = AC = 9 \), we have:
  \[
  4x + 5x = 9 \implies 9x = 9 \implies x = 1
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate \( AF \) and \( FC \)**
- \( AF = 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \)
- \( FC = 5x = 5 \times 1 = 5 \)

**Step 5: Determine \( CF \)**
- Since \( F \) is on \( AC \) and \( FC = 5 \), \( CF = 5 \).

**Step 6: Verify the Calculation**
- The calculations align with the given conditions and the Angle Bisector Theorem.
- The closest answer choice to \( CF = 5 \) is option C.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**
- The calculated value \( CF = 5 \) matches exactly with option C.

**Reflection and Conclusion**
- All steps and calculations have been verified and align with geometric principles and given constraints.
- The solution is consistent with the problem's requirements and the provided answer choices.

**Solution:**
Based on the Angle Bisector Theorem and the given constraints, we calculated \( CF = 5 \). This matches exactly with option C.
