**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).
- Points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) form the triangle.
- Lines \( XY \), \( YZ \), and \( ZX \) are the sides of the triangle.
- \( \angle XYZ \) and \( \angle ZYX \) are right angles. This implies \( \triangle XYZ \) is a right triangle at both \( Y \) and \( Z \).

**Step 2: Summarize Findings**

- Since both \( \angle XYZ \) and \( \angle ZYX \) are right angles, \( \triangle XYZ \) cannot exist as a conventional triangle because the sum of angles in a triangle must be \( 180^\circ \).
- The only way both angles can be right angles is if \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are collinear, forming a degenerate triangle (a straight line).

**Step 3: Consider Point \( W \) and Its Properties**

- Point \( W \) is equidistant from \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).
- This suggests \( W \) is the center of a circle passing through \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).

**Step 4: Analyze \( \angle WYZ \)**

- Since \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are collinear, \( W \) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \( XYZ \).
- The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment.
- \( \angle WYZ \) is formed by the lines \( WY \) and \( YZ \).

**Step 5: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( W \) is equidistant from \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \), and \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are collinear, \( W \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( XYZ \).
- The perpendicular bisector of a line segment forms a right angle with the segment.
- Therefore, \( \angle WYZ \) is a right angle, \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle WYZ \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The answer choices are: A. 4, B. 16, C. 23, D. 32.
- None of these choices are \( 90^\circ \), so we must select the closest value.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest value to \( 90^\circ \) among the choices is \( 32 \).

**Step 8: Conclusion**

- Based on the analysis and the closest value, the correct answer is \( D. 32 \).

**Solution:**

- Given the constraints and analysis, \( \angle WYZ \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 90^\circ \) is \( 32 \).
