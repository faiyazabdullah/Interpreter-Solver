1. **Analyzing the Problem:**
   - We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - It is stated that \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle A, B) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle B, C) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle C, A) \).
   - This implies that all angles in the triangle are equal, making it an equilateral triangle.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - In an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are equal.
   - The sum of the internal angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Brainstorming and Applying Theorems:**
   - Since the triangle is equilateral, each angle must be \( \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \).

4. **Verifying the Accuracy:**
   - Reassessing the calculation: \( \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \) is correct for an equilateral triangle.

5. **Refining Errors:**
   - There are no apparent errors in the calculation or understanding of the problem.

6. **Revisiting Steps:**
   - Confirm that the problem's conditions are satisfied: all angles are equal and sum to \( 180^\circ \).
   - No additional conditions or constraints are given that would alter the conclusion.

7. **Iteration and Reflection:**
   - The conclusion that each angle is \( 60^\circ \) is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.
   - The problem asks to find \( x \), which corresponds to the measure of each angle in this context.

8. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated angle measure is \( 60^\circ \).
   - Among the answer choices, \( 60 \) is listed as option C.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Given the calculated angle measure matches one of the provided choices exactly, select option C.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis, the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral with each angle measuring \( 60^\circ \). Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 60 \).

Final Answer: C.
