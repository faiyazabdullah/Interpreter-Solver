1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**: The problem involves a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the properties that all sides are equal. Specifically, the lengths of the sides are given as \(AB = 2x + 3\) and \(BC = 5x\). In a rhombus, opposite sides are equal, and all sides are equal in length.

2. **Identifying the Goal**: We need to find the length of \(AD\), which, being a rhombus, should be equal to the lengths of \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\).

3. **Applying Geometric Properties**: Since \(AB = BC = CD = DA\), we can set the expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\) equal to each other:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 5x
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation**: Solve for \(x\) by rearranging the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 5x \implies 3 = 5x - 2x \implies 3 = 3x \implies x = 1
   \]

5. **Calculating \(AD\)**: Substitute \(x = 1\) back into either expression for the side length. Using \(AB = 2x + 3\):
   \[
   AB = 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

   Since \(AD\) is equal to \(AB\) (because all sides of a rhombus are equal), \(AD = 5\).

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices**: The calculated length of \(AD\) is 5. Among the given answer choices, the closest match is option D, which is 5.

7. **Verification**: Reassess the steps to ensure no errors were made. The equation was solved correctly, and the substitution was verified to yield the correct side length.

8. **Final Decision**: Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option D.

**Solution:**

To solve the problem, we set the expressions for the side lengths equal due to the property of the rhombus having equal sides:

\[ 
2x + 3 = 5x 
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
2x + 3 = 5x \implies 3 = 5x - 2x \implies 3 = 3x \implies x = 1
\]

Substitute \(x = 1\) back into the expression for \(AB\):

\[
AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5
\]

Since \(AD = AB\) in a rhombus, \(AD = 5\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
