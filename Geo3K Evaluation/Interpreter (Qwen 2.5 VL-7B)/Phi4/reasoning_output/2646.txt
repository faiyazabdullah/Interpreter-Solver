**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a right angle at \( \angle A \).
- The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal in length.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with equal legs \( AB = BC \), it is an isosceles right triangle.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of \( \angle A \) to the nearest tenth.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- In an isosceles right triangle, the two non-right angles are equal.
- Since the sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \), and one angle is \( 90^\circ \) (the right angle), the sum of the other two angles is \( 90^\circ \).
- Therefore, each of the other two angles, \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \), is \( 45^\circ \).

**Step 4: Verify Calculations**

- Given that \( \angle A = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle B = \angle C = 45^\circ \), the measure of \( \angle A \) is indeed \( 90^\circ \).
- However, the question asks for the measure of \( \angle A \) to the nearest tenth, which implies a misunderstanding since \( \angle A \) is the right angle.
- Reassess: The question likely refers to \( \angle B \) or \( \angle C \) since \( \angle A \) is \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

- Since \( \angle A \) is the right angle, the question must be asking for \( \angle B \) or \( \angle C \).
- Both \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \) are \( 45^\circ \).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to \( 45.0^\circ \) is \( 41.8^\circ \).

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the analysis, the measure of \( \angle B \) or \( \angle C \) is \( 45^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice is \( 41.8^\circ \).

<Solution>

Given the constraints and analysis, the measure of \( \angle B \) or \( \angle C \) in the isosceles right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 45^\circ \). The closest answer choice to \( 45.0^\circ \) is \( 41.8^\circ \).
