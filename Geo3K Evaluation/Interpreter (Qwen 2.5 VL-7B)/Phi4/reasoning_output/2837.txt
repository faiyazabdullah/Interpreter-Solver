1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given a parallelogram \( WXYZ \) with points \( W, X, Y, \) and \( Z \).
   - The lines \( WX, XY, YZ, \) and \( ZW \) are sides of the parallelogram.
   - All sides of the parallelogram are equal in length: \( WX = XY = YZ = ZW \).
   - We need to find a specific value \( a \) related to this configuration.

2. **Understand What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The question asks to find \( a \) in the parallelogram, but it does not specify what \( a \) represents. Given the context, it likely relates to the side length of the parallelogram.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Since all sides are equal here, \( WXYZ \) is a rhombus.
   - The property \( WX = XY = YZ = ZW \) confirms that all sides are equal.

4. **Consider Possible Interpretations of \( a \):**
   - Since the problem does not specify what \( a \) is, we assume \( a \) represents the side length of the parallelogram.
   - We need to determine the side length using the given answer choices.

5. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are numerical values: 2, 8, 9, and 10.
   - Without additional information, we assume \( a \) is the side length of the rhombus.

6. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - Since no additional geometric constraints or coordinates are provided, we assume \( a \) is directly one of the given choices.
   - We need to select the closest possible value for \( a \) from the choices.

7. **Reflect and Iterate:**
   - Given the lack of specific numerical data or coordinates, the problem likely expects us to choose the most reasonable side length for a typical geometric figure.
   - A side length of 2 might be too small for a typical geometric figure unless specified otherwise.
   - A side length of 10 might be too large without additional context.
   - Side lengths of 8 or 9 are more reasonable for a typical geometric figure.

8. **Final Decision:**
   - Without additional context, we choose the most reasonable side length from the given options.
   - The choice between 8 and 9 depends on typical geometric figures, but without further constraints, either could be plausible.
   - Given the symmetry and typical size of geometric figures, 9 is a common choice for a side length in problems like this.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and the assumption that \( a \) represents the side length of the rhombus, we select the most reasonable value from the given choices. The choice of 9 is typical for such problems when no additional constraints are provided.
