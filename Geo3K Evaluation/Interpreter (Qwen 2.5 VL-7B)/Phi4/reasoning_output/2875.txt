**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**
- We have a right triangle \( \triangle PQR \) with \( \angle PRQ = 90^\circ \).
- Points \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) form the triangle.
- We have line segments \( PQ \), \( QR \), and \( PR \).
- The right angle is at \( R \), making \( PR \) and \( QR \) the legs of the triangle, and \( PQ \) the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**
- We are tasked with finding \( PS \). However, \( S \) is not defined in the problem. This suggests there may be a typo or a missing detail, so we assume \( PS \) refers to \( PR \), the length of one of the legs of the right triangle.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties**
- Since \( \triangle PQR \) is a right triangle with \( \angle PRQ = 90^\circ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  PQ^2 = PR^2 + QR^2
  \]
- We need to find \( PR \), which is \( PS \) in the question.

**Step 4: Use the given information**
- The problem states "Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,R))", which implies \( PR \) is given as a specific value. However, no explicit length is provided in the problem statement. This suggests we need to infer or calculate \( PR \) using the answer choices.

**Step 5: Consider the answer choices**
- The answer choices are \( A. 7 \), \( B. 9 \), \( C. 14 \), \( D. 16 \).
- Since \( PR \) is a leg of the right triangle, it must be less than the hypotenuse \( PQ \).

**Step 6: Logical deduction**
- Without additional information about \( PQ \) or \( QR \), we assume \( PR \) is one of the answer choices.
- Typically, in problems like this, the simplest or most common lengths are chosen for legs of a right triangle, especially when no other information is provided.

**Step 7: Verify and refine**
- If \( PR = 7 \), \( 9 \), \( 14 \), or \( 16 \), we need to check if these values make sense as a leg of a right triangle.
- Without loss of generality, assume \( PR = 9 \) (a common leg length in right triangles).

**Step 8: Compare with answer choices**
- Given the lack of additional information, \( PR = 9 \) is a reasonable assumption.
- Check if \( PR = 9 \) fits with typical right triangle properties (e.g., Pythagorean triples).

**Step 9: Final decision**
- \( PR = 9 \) is a plausible length for a leg of a right triangle, especially given the lack of further information.
- Therefore, the closest and most reasonable choice is \( B. 9 \).

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and logical deductions, the most reasonable assumption for \( PR \) given the answer choices and typical properties of right triangles is \( 9 \).
