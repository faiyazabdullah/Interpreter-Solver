**Step 1: Understand the Given Constraints**

- We have three circles: Circle(A), Circle(B), and Circle(C).
- Points A, B, and C are the centers of these circles respectively.
- Each circle is the incircle of the other two circles. This implies that each circle is tangent to the other two circles at some point.
- Each pair of points (A, B), (B, C), and (C, A) forms the diameter of a circle. Thus, Line(A,B), Line(B,C), and Line(C,A) are diameters of their respective circles.
- Each pair of points also forms the radius of another circle, indicating that the radii of the circles are equal to half the lengths of these diameters.

**Step 2: Analyze the Relationships**

- Since each line segment is both a diameter of one circle and a radius of another, the radii of all circles are equal.
- Let the radius of each circle be \( r \). Therefore, the diameter of each circle is \( 2r \).

**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Each Circle**

- The area of a circle is given by the formula \( \pi r^2 \).
- Since all circles have the same radius \( r \), the area of each circle is \( \pi r^2 \).

**Step 4: Determine the Total Area of the Circles**

- The total area of the three circles is \( 3 \pi r^2 \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**

- The shaded region is the area inside Circle(A) but outside Circles(B) and (C).
- Since each circle is tangent to the other two, the shaded region is the area of Circle(A) minus the areas of the segments of Circles(B) and (C) that lie inside Circle(A).

**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Overlapping Segments**

- The area of the segment of a circle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord.
- However, since each circle is tangent to the other two, the segments are actually semicircles of radius \( r \).
- The area of a semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).

**Step 7: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**

- The area of the shaded region is the area of Circle(A) minus the areas of the two semicircles from Circles(B) and (C).
- Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
  \[
  \pi r^2 - 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \pi r^2 - \pi r^2 = 0
  \]
- This indicates a miscalculation in understanding the geometry. Let's reassess.

**Reassessment:**

- Since each circle is tangent to the other two, the shaded region is actually the area of the lens-shaped region formed by the intersection of Circle(A) with Circles(B) and (C).
- The area of this lens-shaped region can be calculated by subtracting the areas of the two segments from Circle(A).

**Final Calculation:**

- The area of each segment in Circle(A) is the area of a sector minus the area of the triangle.
- The central angle for each segment is \( 60^\circ \) (since the circles are symmetrically arranged).
- The area of each sector is \( \frac{60}{360} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 \).
- The area of the equilateral triangle formed by the centers is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (2r)^2 = \sqrt{3} r^2 \).
- The area of each segment is \( \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2 \).
- The total area of the two segments is \( 2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2 \right) \).

**Final Area of Shaded Region:**

- The area of the shaded region is:
  \[
  \pi r^2 - 2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2 \right) = \pi r^2 - \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2
  \]

**Step 8: Use Given Information**

- We know the area of Circle(A) is \( \pi r^2 \).
- The problem states \( \text{Sub}(\text{AreaOf}(Circle(A))) \), which suggests the area of the shaded region is a subtraction from Circle(A)'s area.
- Assume \( \pi r^2 = 314.2 \) (since it's a common value for \(\pi\) calculations with \( r = 10 \)).
- Calculate:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 314.2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 100
  \]
  \[
  = 209.47 + 86.6 \approx 296.1
  \]

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer to 296.1 is 295.6, which rounds to 295.6.

**Solution:**

Based on the calculations, the area of the shaded region is closest to 295.6, which rounds to 295.6. Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Final Answer: C. 235.6
