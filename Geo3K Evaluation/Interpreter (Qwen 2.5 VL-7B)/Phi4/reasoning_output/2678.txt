### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two angles, \(\angle A,B,G\) and \(\angle A,B,J\), and we know:
     - \(m \angle 2 = 2x\)
     - \(m \angle 3 = x\)
     - The measures of these angles are equal, i.e., \(m \angle A,B,G = m \angle A,B,J\).

2. **Summarize the Problem:**
   - We need to find \(m \angle 2\).
   - We know \(m \angle 2 = 2x\) and \(m \angle 3 = x\).
   - Since the measures of \(\angle A,B,G\) and \(\angle A,B,J\) are equal, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2x = x
     \]

3. **Explore the Equation:**
   - From the equation \(2x = x\), we can solve for \(x\):
     - Subtract \(x\) from both sides: \(2x - x = 0\)
     - Simplify: \(x = 0\)

4. **Verify and Reflect:**
   - If \(x = 0\), then \(m \angle 3 = x = 0\) and \(m \angle 2 = 2x = 0\).
   - This implies both angles are zero, which is not possible in a typical geometric context unless they are degenerate angles.

5. **Reassess the Setup:**
   - Re-evaluate the equality condition: \(m \angle A,B,G = m \angle A,B,J\).
   - This implies \(2x = x\) is a misinterpretation unless considering a specific geometric configuration where such equality holds trivially.

6. **Consider Alternative Interpretations:**
   - If the angles are supplementary or part of a linear pair, then:
     \[
     2x + x = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Simplify: \(3x = 180^\circ\)
   - Solve for \(x\): \(x = 60^\circ\)

7. **Calculate \(m \angle 2\):**
   - \(m \angle 2 = 2x = 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ\)

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(m \angle 2 = 120^\circ\) does not match any answer choice directly.
   - The closest option to \(120^\circ\) is \(90^\circ\).

9. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the constraint to choose the closest answer, select \(90^\circ\).

### Solution Section

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle 2\) is closest to \(90^\circ\) when considering the constraints and possible configurations.
- Therefore, the correct answer choice is \(D\).

Final Answer: D
