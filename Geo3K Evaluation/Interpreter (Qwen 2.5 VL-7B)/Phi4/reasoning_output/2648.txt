1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle centered at \( O \), with points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) on the circle. 
   - Lines \( OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, \) and \( OF \) are radii of the circle.
   - \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ACD \) are right angles, which implies that both \( BD \) and \( CD \) are diameters of the circle.
   - \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ACD \) have equal measures.
   - \( \angle BAC \) is given, and we need to find its measure, denoted as \( x \).

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - Since \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ACD \) are right angles, \( BD \) and \( CD \) are diameters, making \( \angle BOD = 180^\circ \) and \( \angle COD = 180^\circ \).
   - The equality of \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ACD \) suggests symmetry about the line \( AD \).

3. **Exploring New Ideas:**
   - Since \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD \) and both are right angles, \( B \) and \( C \) are symmetric with respect to \( AD \).
   - The circle's symmetry and the right angles suggest that \( B \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter perpendicular to \( AD \).

4. **Verifying the Accuracy of Current Steps:**
   - The symmetry and the fact that \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD = 90^\circ \) confirm that \( B \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter perpendicular to \( AD \).

5. **Refining Any Errors:**
   - Reassess the placement of points: \( B \) and \( C \) must be endpoints of a diameter perpendicular to \( AD \), confirming \( \angle BAC \) is inscribed in a semicircle.

6. **Revisiting Previous Steps:**
   - Given \( \angle BAC \) is inscribed in a semicircle, by the inscribed angle theorem, \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).

7. **Iteration and Reflection:**
   - The problem's constraints and symmetry strongly suggest that \( \angle BAC \) is indeed \( 90^\circ \).

<Solution>

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD = 90^\circ \) implies \( BD \) and \( CD \) are diameters.
   - \( B \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter perpendicular to \( AD \).

2. **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - \( \angle BAC \) is inscribed in a semicircle formed by diameter \( BC \).
   - By the inscribed angle theorem, an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).

4. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle BAC \) is \( 90^\circ \).
   - This matches answer choice D.
