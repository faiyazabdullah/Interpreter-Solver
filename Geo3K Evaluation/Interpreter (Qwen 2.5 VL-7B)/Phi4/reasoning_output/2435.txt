**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- The lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) are the sides of the triangle.
- We know that the measures of angles \( \angle ABC \), \( \angle BCA \), and \( \angle CAB \) are equal.
- Additionally, the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is equal to the length of line \( AC \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since all angles in the triangle are equal, \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle.
- In an equilateral triangle, each angle measures \( 60^\circ \).
- The problem states that the measure of \( \angle ABC \) (which is \( 60^\circ \)) is equal to the length of line \( AC \).

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**

- The equality of angles and the equality of \( \angle ABC \) to the length of \( AC \) suggest a numerical equivalence between the angle measure and a length.
- Since \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \), it implies \( AC = 60 \).

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps**

- Reassess the interpretation: If \( AC \) is indeed \( 60 \), then the problem might be asking for a transformation or comparison to the given answer choices.
- Consider the possibility of a unit conversion or scaling factor that could relate \( 60 \) to one of the answer choices.

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**

- Re-evaluate the problem statement: It is clear that \( AC = 60 \) based on the given conditions.
- Check if any arithmetic or logical errors were made: No errors found in the interpretation of the problem.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**

- Confirm that the interpretation of the problem constraints is consistent with the conclusion that \( AC = 60 \).
- Ensure that no additional information or constraints were overlooked.

**Step 7: Explore the Answer Choices**

- The answer choices are: A. 25, B. 40, C. 65, D. 115.
- The calculated length \( AC = 60 \) is closest to answer choice C. 65.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and analysis, the length of \( AC \) is determined to be \( 60 \). Among the provided answer choices, the closest value to \( 60 \) is \( 65 \).
