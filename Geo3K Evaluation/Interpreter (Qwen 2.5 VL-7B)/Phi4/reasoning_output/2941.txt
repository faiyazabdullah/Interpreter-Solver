**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a square \(ABDC\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot K\).
- The square's vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circle.
- We are asked to find the measure of a central angle in this configuration.

**Step 2: Understand the Geometric Properties**
- Since \(ABDC\) is a square, all its internal angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
- The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at \(90^\circ\).
- The diagonals of the square are also diameters of the circle because the square is inscribed in the circle.

**Step 3: Identify the Central Angle**
- A central angle is formed by two radii of the circle.
- In this case, we need to consider the central angle subtended by one side of the square or by the diagonals.

**Step 4: Calculate the Central Angle Subtended by a Side**
- The square is inscribed in the circle, dividing the circle into four equal arcs.
- Each side of the square subtends an arc of \(90^\circ\) because the circle is divided into four equal parts by the square.
- Therefore, the central angle subtended by one side of the square is \(90^\circ\).

**Step 5: Calculate the Central Angle Subtended by a Diagonal**
- The diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle.
- A diameter subtends a central angle of \(180^\circ\).

**Step 6: Determine the Relevant Central Angle**
- The problem asks for the measure of a central angle, and typically, when referring to a central angle in such problems, it is the angle subtended by one side of the inscribed polygon (square in this case).

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The central angle subtended by one side of the square is \(90^\circ\).
- The answer choices are: \(45^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), \(90^\circ\), \(180^\circ\).
- The calculated central angle \(90^\circ\) matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 8: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the analysis, the central angle subtended by one side of the square is \(90^\circ\).
- This matches choice \(C\).

**Solution:**
The central angle subtended by one side of the square \(ABDC\) inscribed in the circle \(\odot K\) is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
