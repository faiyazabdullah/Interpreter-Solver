### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - The lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the rectangle.
   - Right angles are present at each vertex, confirming the shape is indeed a rectangle.
   - It is specified that \( \text{Length of } AD = \text{Length of } AB \). This implies that the rectangle is actually a square because both adjacent sides are equal.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a square, all sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
   - The area of the square is given as \( \text{Area} = 9 \times 16 \).

3. **Brainstorming and Calculations:**
   - The area of the square is calculated as \(9 \times 16 = 144\).
   - Since the area of a square is also given by \( \text{side}^2 \), and we know the area is 144, we can find the side length by taking the square root: \(\sqrt{144} = 12\).
   - Therefore, each side of the square is 12 units long.

4. **Verification and Reflection:**
   - Verify that the calculations align with the properties of a square.
   - The area calculation \(9 \times 16 = 144\) is straightforward and matches the area formula for a square.

5. **Reassessment and Finalization:**
   - The given area calculation directly matches one of the answer choices.
   - There are no discrepancies or errors in the calculations or assumptions.

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area of the square is 144, which matches option D.

### Solution

The problem involves determining the area of a geometric figure given as a rectangle with equal adjacent sides, making it a square. The area of the square is calculated directly from the given multiplication \(9 \times 16\), resulting in 144. This matches the properties of a square where the area is the square of the side length, and the side length is confirmed as 12 units. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Final Answer: D
