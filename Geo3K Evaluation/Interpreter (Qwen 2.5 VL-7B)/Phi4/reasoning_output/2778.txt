**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a circle centered at point A.
- There are several lines: \(X, Y\), \(W, Z\), and \(W, Y\).
- Points \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\), and \(W\) are defined.
- Line \(X, Y\) intersects at a point, which suggests that \(X\) and \(Y\) are endpoints of a chord or diameter.
- Lines \(X, W\), \(Y, W\), \(W, Y\), and \(W, Z\) are segments of other lines.
- The lengths of segments \(X, W\), \(Y, W\), and \(W, Y\) are equal.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \(X, W\), \(Y, W\), and \(W, Y\) are equal in length, and \(W, Y\) is a segment of line \(W, Y\), it suggests that \(W\) is the midpoint of segment \(X, Y\).
- This implies that \(X, Y\) is a diameter of the circle, with \(W\) as its midpoint.

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Properties**

- Since \(W\) is the midpoint of \(X, Y\) and \(X, Y\) is a diameter, \(A\) (the center of the circle) must also be the midpoint of \(X, Y\).
- Therefore, \(A\), \(W\), and the midpoint of \(X, Y\) coincide.

**Step 4: Apply Relevant Theorems**

- The length of the diameter \(X, Y\) is twice the radius of the circle.
- Let the radius of the circle be \(r\). Then, the length of \(X, Y\) is \(2r\).
- Since \(W\) is the midpoint, \(XW = WY = r\).

**Step 5: Consider the Line \(W, Z\)**

- Line \(W, Z\) is a segment, and \(W\) is a point on it.
- We need to find \(x\), which could be related to the length of \(W, Z\).

**Step 6: Calculate Using Given Information**

- Since \(XW = WY = r\), and \(W\) is the midpoint of \(X, Y\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem if necessary.
- If \(WZ\) is perpendicular to \(X, Y\), then \(WZ\) would be a radius, and \(WZ = r\).

**Step 7: Reassess and Refine**

- We need to find \(x\), which might be the length of \(WZ\).
- If \(WZ\) is perpendicular to \(X, Y\), then \(WZ\) is a radius, and \(x = r\).

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- We need to express \(r\) in terms of the given answer choices.
- Since \(XW = WY = r\), and \(X, Y\) is a diameter, we can assume \(X, Y\) is a specific length that fits one of the answer choices when doubled.

**Step 9: Calculate Possible Values**

- Assume \(X, Y = 2r\) and check if any answer choice fits when halved.
- Given the answer choices, calculate \(r\) for each:

  - \(A. \frac{72}{7}\) implies \(2r = \frac{144}{7}\)
  - \(B. 14\) implies \(2r = 28\)
  - \(C. \frac{95}{6}\) implies \(2r = \frac{190}{6}\)
  - \(D. \frac{97}{6}\) implies \(2r = \frac{194}{6}\)

- Calculate \(r\) for each:
  - \(A: r = \frac{72}{7}\)
  - \(B: r = 14\)
  - \(C: r = \frac{95}{12}\)
  - \(D: r = \frac{97}{12}\)

- Since \(r\) must be a rational number and fit the geometric constraints, check which is feasible.

**Step 10: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest rational number that fits the geometric constraints is \(r = \frac{72}{7}\), which corresponds to choice \(A\).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the length \(x\) that fits the geometric properties and constraints is \(\frac{72}{7}\).
