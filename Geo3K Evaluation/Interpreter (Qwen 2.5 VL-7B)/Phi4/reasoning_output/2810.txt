**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a rectangle \(ABCD\). In a rectangle, all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).
- We are given \(m \angle 1 = 38^\circ\).
- We need to find \(m \angle 2\).

**Step 2: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

- The angles mentioned (\(1\) to \(8\)) are likely internal angles formed by extending some of the lines of the rectangle.
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, adjacent angles along the rectangle's sides will sum to \(180^\circ\) (straight line).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Theorems**

- If \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are adjacent angles forming a straight line, then:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
- We are given \(m \angle 1 = 38^\circ\).

**Step 4: Calculate \(m \angle 2\)**

- Substitute the given value into the equation:
  \[
  38^\circ + m \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solve for \(m \angle 2\):
  \[
  m \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 38^\circ = 142^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(m \angle 2 = 142^\circ\) does not match any of the provided answer choices directly.
- The answer choices are: \(33\), \(38\), \(52\), \(87\).
- Since \(m \angle 2 = 142^\circ\) is not close to any of these, we need to reassess the interpretation of angles.

**Step 6: Reassess the Interpretation**

- Consider if \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are not directly adjacent on a straight line but part of a different geometric configuration.
- In a rectangle, if \(\angle 1\) is an interior angle formed by extending a diagonal, then \(\angle 2\) could be the complementary angle to \(\angle 1\) within the right triangle formed by the diagonal.
- In a right triangle, the two non-right angles sum to \(90^\circ\).

**Step 7: Recalculate Using Complementary Angle**

- If \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are complementary:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 90^\circ
  \]
- Substitute the given value:
  \[
  38^\circ + m \angle 2 = 90^\circ
  \]
- Solve for \(m \angle 2\):
  \[
  m \angle 2 = 90^\circ - 38^\circ = 52^\circ
  \]

**Step 8: Verify and Select the Closest Answer**

- The recalculated \(m \angle 2 = 52^\circ\) matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

<Solution>

Based on the reassessment that \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are complementary angles within a right triangle formed by a diagonal of the rectangle, we find:

\[
m \angle 2 = 52^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
