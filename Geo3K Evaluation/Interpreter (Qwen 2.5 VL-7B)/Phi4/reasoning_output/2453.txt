### Thought Section

1. **Understand the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a rhombus \( FGHIJ \) with diagonals intersecting at point \( K \).
   - \( GH = x + 9 \) and \( JH = 5x - 2 \).
   - In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( FGHIJ \) is a rhombus, all sides are equal: \( FG = GH = HI = IJ = JF \).
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and are not equal, but they split the rhombus into four right triangles.
   - The diagonals bisect each other, so \( GK = KH \) and \( JK = KI \).

4. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since \( GH = JH \) (as diagonals bisect each other), we equate the expressions:
     \[
     x + 9 = 5x - 2
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x + 9 = 5x - 2
     \]
   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     9 = 4x - 2
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     11 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Check the calculation steps to ensure no arithmetic errors.
   - Confirm that \( x = 2.75 \) satisfies the condition \( GH = JH \).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 2.75 \) matches answer choice A.

8. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Ensure all assumptions and steps align with the properties of a rhombus.
   - Confirm that the diagonals bisect each other and the calculations are consistent with the problem constraints.

**Solution:**

1. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since \( GH = JH \), we have:
     \[
     x + 9 = 5x - 2
     \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange:
     \[
     9 = 4x - 2
     \]
   - Add 2:
     \[
     11 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 2.75 \) matches answer choice A.
