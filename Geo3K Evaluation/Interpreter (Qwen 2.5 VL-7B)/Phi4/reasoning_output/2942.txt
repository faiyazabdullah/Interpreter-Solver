**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
- The lines \( AB, BC, \) and \( AC \) are sides of the triangle.
- It is given that \( \text{LengthOf}(AB) = \text{LengthOf}(BC) = \text{LengthOf}(AC) \). This implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral.
- An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to \( 60^\circ \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, all sides are equal.
- The problem asks to find \( BC \).
- Since \( AB = BC = AC \), finding one side length will give the length of \( BC \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**

- In an equilateral triangle, if one side is known, all sides are the same.
- The problem does not provide a specific numerical length for any side, but we need to determine \( BC \) from the given answer choices.

**Step 4: Consider the Answer Choices**

- The answer choices are numerical values: 6, 9, 15, and 60.
- Since no specific numerical length is given, we assume a standard equilateral triangle where side lengths are typically simple integers or common geometric constants.

**Step 5: Verification and Reflection**

- Without additional information, we assume a standard equilateral triangle where side lengths are simple integers.
- The most common simple integer side length for an equilateral triangle in basic problems is 6.

**Step 6: Reassess and Conclude**

- Given the constraints and typical problem settings, the simplest assumption is that \( BC = 6 \).
- This aligns with the common practice of using simple integers for side lengths in basic geometry problems.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis, \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, and all sides are equal. Without specific numerical values provided, the simplest assumption is that the side length is a common integer. The most typical choice for an equilateral triangle in basic geometry problems is 6. Therefore, the length of \( BC \) is 6.
