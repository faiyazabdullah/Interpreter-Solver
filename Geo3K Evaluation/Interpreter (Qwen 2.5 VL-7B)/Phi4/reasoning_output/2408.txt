1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with a right angle at \( Y \).
   - \( YZ \) is the hypotenuse, and \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are the legs.
   - \( XY = XZ \) since all sides are equal, indicating \( \triangle XYZ \) is an isosceles right triangle.
   - The lengths of the legs \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are given as 10 units each.

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( NZ \), given:
     - \( XN = 6 \)
     - \( XM = 2 \)
     - \( XY = 10 \)

3. **Applying Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - In an isosceles right triangle, the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     YZ = \sqrt{XY^2 + XZ^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Understanding the Role of Points \( N \) and \( M \):**
   - The problem does not specify the positions of \( N \) and \( M \) relative to the triangle, but given \( XN = 6 \) and \( XM = 2 \), we can infer they might be on the extensions of the legs or hypotenuse.
   - Since \( XY = XZ = 10 \), and \( XN = 6 \), \( N \) could be on the extension of \( XY \) or \( XZ \).

5. **Calculating \( NZ \):**
   - If \( N \) is on the extension of \( XY \), then \( YN = XY + XN = 10 + 6 = 16 \).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle YNZ \):
     \[
     NZ = \sqrt{YN^2 + YZ^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + (10\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{256 + 200} = \sqrt{456}
     \]
   - Simplifying \( \sqrt{456} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{456} = \sqrt{4 \times 114} = 2\sqrt{114}
     \]
   - Approximating \( \sqrt{114} \approx 10.68 \), so \( 2\sqrt{114} \approx 21.36 \).

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The closest answer choice to \( 21.36 \) is \( 24 \).

7. **Verification and Conclusion:**
   - Reassessing the calculations and assumptions, the approach and calculations seem consistent with the problem constraints.
   - The closest choice to the calculated \( NZ \approx 21.36 \) is \( 24 \).

Solution:
Given the constraints and calculations, the closest answer choice to the calculated \( NZ \approx 21.36 \) is \( 24 \).
