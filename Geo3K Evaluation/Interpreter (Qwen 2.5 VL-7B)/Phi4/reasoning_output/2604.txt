1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC \) being the right angle.
   - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) are equal in length.
   - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
   - The equation given is \( \text{Square of the length of } AC = \text{Square of the length of } AB + \text{Square of the length of } BC \).

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find \( x \), which is likely the length of the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) since they are equal.
   - Given the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
     \]
   - Since \( AB = BC = AC \), we can denote the common length as \( x \).

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Substitute the equal lengths into the equation:
     \[
     x^2 = x^2 + x^2
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x^2 = 2x^2
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies -x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 0
     \]
   - This implies a contradiction because \( x \) cannot be zero for a triangle with positive side lengths.

5. **Reassessing the Setup:**
   - Recognize the error: The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) cannot all be equal in a right triangle unless it is a degenerate triangle (which is not possible here).
   - Reinterpret the problem: \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, and \( AB = BC = x \).

6. **Correct Application of the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Use the correct setup:
     \[
     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \implies AC^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - Since \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \) (from the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle):
     \[
     (x\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - This confirms the setup is correct.

7. **Finding \( x \):**
   - Given that \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \), and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, we need to find \( x \) such that:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = x\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - The problem implies a specific value for \( x \) based on the answer choices.

8. **Checking Answer Choices:**
   - Since \( AC = x\sqrt{2} \), and \( AC^2 = 2x^2 \), we need to find \( x \) such that:
     \[
     AC = x\sqrt{2} = \text{some value from the choices}
     \]
   - Check each choice:
     - If \( x = 12 \), \( AC = 12\sqrt{2} \approx 16.97 \)
     - If \( x = 15 \), \( AC = 15\sqrt{2} \approx 21.21 \)
     - If \( x = 18 \), \( AC = 18\sqrt{2} \approx 25.46 \)
     - If \( x = 21 \), \( AC = 21\sqrt{2} \approx 29.70 \)

9. **Selecting the Closest Value:**
   - The closest integer value for \( AC \) that matches the hypotenuse condition is when \( x = 15 \), giving \( AC \approx 21.21 \).

</think>
<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the closest value for \( x \) that satisfies the conditions given in the problem is when \( x = 15 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
