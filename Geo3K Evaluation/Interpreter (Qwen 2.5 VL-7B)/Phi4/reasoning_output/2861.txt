**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have two parallel lines, \( l \) and \( m \), and a transversal line \( n \) that intersects both.
- We need to identify angles that are supplementary to \(\angle 1\). By definition, supplementary angles add up to \(180^\circ\).

**Step 2: Understand the Configuration**
- Since \( l \parallel m \) and \( n \) is the transversal, several angle relationships can be identified:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary.

**Step 3: Identify Relationships Involving \(\angle 1\)**
- \(\angle 1\) is formed by the intersection of line \( n \) with line \( l \).
- The angles directly supplementary to \(\angle 1\) on line \( l \) are consecutive interior angles with respect to the transversal \( n \).

**Step 4: Determine Supplementary Angles**
- The angle adjacent to \(\angle 1\) on line \( l \) is supplementary to \(\angle 1\). Let's call this \(\angle 2\).
- Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are on the same line, they add up to \(180^\circ\).

**Step 5: Use Parallel Line Properties**
- \(\angle 1\) and the corresponding angle on line \( m \) (let's call it \(\angle 5\)) are equal because they are corresponding angles.
- \(\angle 5\) and its adjacent angle on line \( m \) (let's call it \(\angle 8\)) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.

**Step 6: Identify Alternate Interior Angles**
- The alternate interior angle to \(\angle 1\) on line \( m\) is \(\angle 4\). Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 4\) are equal (alternate interior angles), the angle supplementary to \(\angle 4\) is also supplementary to \(\angle 1\).

**Step 7: Compile the List of Supplementary Angles**
- From the above analysis, the angles supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are:
  - \(\angle 2\) (adjacent on line \( l\))
  - \(\angle 4\) (alternate interior angle on line \( m\))
  - \(\angle 8\) (adjacent to \(\angle 5\) on line \( m\))

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**
- We have identified \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 4\), and \(\angle 8\) as supplementary to \(\angle 1\).
- Reviewing the answer choices:
  - A: \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\)
  - B: \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\)
  - C: \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 7\), \(\angle 8\)
  - D: \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 8\)

- The angles \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 4\), and \(\angle 8\) match with choice B (which includes \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\)) and choice D (which includes \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 8\)). However, choice B includes \(\angle 3\), which is not supplementary to \(\angle 1\), and choice D includes \(\angle 5\), which is not supplementary to \(\angle 1\).

- Therefore, the closest match is choice B, as it includes two of the three correct angles (\(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 4\)) and is the closest option.

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis of the geometric properties and relationships, the angles supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 4\), and \(\angle 8\). The closest answer choice that includes the most of these angles is:

Final Answer: B.
