**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a trapezoid \( QR \, TU \) with \( QR \parallel TU \).
- Points \( V \) and \( S \) are midpoints of legs \( QU \) and \( RT \), respectively.
- Given lengths: \( QR = 4 \) and \( TU = 16 \).
- We need to find the length of \( VS \).

**Step 2: Understand the Problem**

- The midsegment (or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) of the trapezoid.
- The midsegment is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- The length of the midsegment \( VS \) in trapezoid \( QR \, TU \) can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  VS = \frac{QR + TU}{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**

- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of \( VS \) is 10.
- Check the answer choices: A. 5, B. 9, C. 10, D. 12.
- The calculated value matches choice C.

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**

- Reassess the calculations and the application of the midsegment theorem to ensure accuracy.
- The calculations are correct, and the application of the theorem is appropriate for the given trapezoid configuration.

**Solution:**

To find the length of \( VS \), we used the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, which states that the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases). Given \( QR = 4 \) and \( TU = 16 \), the length of \( VS \) is calculated as follows:

\[
VS = \frac{QR + TU}{2} = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \( VS \) is 10, which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
