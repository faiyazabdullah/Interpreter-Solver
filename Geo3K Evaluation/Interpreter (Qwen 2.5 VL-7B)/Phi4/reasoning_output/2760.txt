**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given a circle A with two diameters, DF and PG.
- The length of diameter DF is 10.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find the length of DA, where D is one endpoint of the diameter DF, and A is the center of the circle.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**

- A diameter of a circle is a straight line passing through the center of the circle and connecting two points on the circumference.
- The length of a diameter is twice the radius of the circle.
- Therefore, if DF is the diameter, then the radius (r) of the circle is half of DF.

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**

- Given: Length of DF = 10
- The radius r = DF / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

**Step 5: Determine DA**

- Since DA is the radius of the circle (as D is on the circumference and A is the center), DA = r = 5.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of DA is 5.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 5
  - B. 10
  - C. 20
  - D. 25

- The calculated value matches option A.

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**

- Verify that the calculations and logic are consistent with the properties of a circle.
- The solution is consistent with the understanding that the radius is half the diameter.

<Solution>

1. The diameter DF of circle A is given as 10.
2. The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so the radius r = 10 / 2 = 5.
3. Since DA is the radius of the circle (D is on the circumference and A is the center), DA = 5.
4. The closest answer choice to the calculated DA is option A.

Final Answer: A
