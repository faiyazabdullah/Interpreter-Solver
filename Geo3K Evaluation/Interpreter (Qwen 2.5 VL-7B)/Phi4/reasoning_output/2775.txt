1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific properties that define it as a parallelogram.
   - Properties of a parallelogram include: opposite sides being equal and parallel.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - Given:
     - \( \text{Line}(A, D) \) is parallel to \( \text{Line}(B, C) \).
     - \( \text{Line}(A, B) \) is parallel to \( \text{Line}(C, D) \).
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A, D)) = \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(B, C)) \).
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A, B)) = \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(C, D)) \).

3. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( x \) such that these conditions confirm ABCD as a parallelogram.

4. **Applying Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The properties of parallelograms given can be summarized as:
     - \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( AD \parallel BC \).
     - \( AB = CD \) and \( AD = BC \).

5. **Exploring the Problem:**
   - We are given that \( AD = BC \) and \( AB = CD \).
   - These are the conditions for a parallelogram based on the properties of opposite sides being equal and parallel.

6. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Assume coordinates for points A, B, C, D based on the given parallel and equal length conditions.
   - Let \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (x, 0) \), \( D = (0, y) \), and \( C = (x, y) \).
   - The length \( AD = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (y-0)^2} = y \).
   - The length \( BC = \sqrt{(x-x)^2 + (y-0)^2} = y \).
   - The length \( AB = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = x \).
   - The length \( CD = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-y)^2} = x \).

7. **Verifying the Accuracy of Current Steps:**
   - With the setup, \( AD = BC = y \) and \( AB = CD = x \).
   - This confirms the conditions \( AD = BC \) and \( AB = CD \).

8. **Refining Errors and Revisiting Steps:**
   - The setup aligns with the properties of a parallelogram.
   - No further adjustments are needed as the setup satisfies all conditions.

9. **Calculating and Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - Since \( x \) is the length of \( AB \) and \( CD \), and no specific numerical values for \( x \) or \( y \) are given, we assume \( x \) must satisfy the conditions of a parallelogram.
   - Given answer choices: A. 13, B. 26, C. 39, D. 52.
   - Without additional constraints or values, we assume \( x \) is the smallest positive integer satisfying the conditions.

10. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
    - The problem does not provide specific numerical constraints beyond the geometric properties.
    - Choose the smallest positive integer from the answer choices that could logically represent a side length in a typical geometric problem setup.

</think>

<Solution>

- Based on the properties of a parallelogram and the setup of coordinates, the length \( x \) satisfies the conditions for opposite sides being equal.
- The problem does not specify additional constraints, so we select the smallest positive integer from the answer choices.
- The smallest value is 13, which is a reasonable assumption for a side length in a typical geometric problem.
