**Step 1: Analyzing the given information**

- We have a rhombus ABCD.
- In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.
- We are given that \( m \angle ABC = 70^\circ \).
- We need to find \( m \angle 1 \) where \( \angle 1 \) is given to be equal to \( m \angle DAC \).

**Step 2: Summarizing relevant geometric properties**

- In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle ABC = \angle CDA \) and \( \angle BCD = \angle DAB \).
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees) and bisect the angles of the rhombus.

**Step 3: Applying geometric properties**

- Since the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus, \( \angle DAC \) is half of \( \angle DAB \).
- We know \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \). Since \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle DAB \) are supplementary (they form a linear pair), we have:
  \[
  \angle DAB = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Calculating \( m \angle 1 \)**

- Since the diagonal bisects \( \angle DAB \), we have:
  \[
  \angle DAC = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle DAB = \frac{1}{2} \times 110^\circ = 55^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Verification**

- Verify that the calculated \( m \angle 1 = 55^\circ \) is consistent with the properties of a rhombus and the given information.
- The calculation aligns with the property that diagonals bisect the angles of a rhombus.

**Step 6: Comparing with answer choices**

- The calculated \( m \angle 1 = 55^\circ \) matches answer choice B.

<Solution>

Based on the properties of a rhombus and the given information, we determined that \( m \angle 1 \) is equal to \( 55^\circ \). This calculation is consistent with the geometric properties of a rhombus, specifically that the diagonals bisect the angles. Therefore, the correct answer is:
