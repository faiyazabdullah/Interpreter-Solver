1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We are given three points, \( F, G, \) and \( H \), and their respective distances: \( FG = 18 \), \( GH = 42 \), and \( FK = 15 \).
   - We are to find the value of \( a \), where \( a \) represents a particular value related to these lengths. However, the question does not directly state what \( a \) represents in this context. We need to infer the relationship between these lengths.

2. **Understanding the Problem Context:**
   - The points \( F, G, H, \) and \( K \) are likely aligned in a straight line or form a geometric relationship where these distances are meaningful.
   - Since \( a \) is not defined in terms of a formula or relation directly, we need to consider standard geometric relationships or configurations that could involve these distances.

3. **Considering Possible Geometric Configurations:**
   - One common geometric interpretation in problems like this is the collinearity of points, where the distances can be added or subtracted along a line.
   - \( FG = 18 \) and \( GH = 42 \) suggest that \( F, G, \) and \( H \) are collinear in that order.

4. **Exploring Possible Relationships:**
   - If \( F, G, \) and \( H \) are collinear, the total distance \( FH \) can be calculated as \( FG + GH = 18 + 42 = 60 \).
   - The distance \( FK = 15 \) is given, but its position relative to \( F, G, \) and \( H \) is not specified. We need to explore possible scenarios:
     - \( K \) could be between \( F \) and \( G \).
     - \( K \) could be between \( G \) and \( H \).
     - \( K \) could be beyond \( H \).

5. **Calculating Possible Values for \( a \):**
   - If \( K \) is between \( F \) and \( G \), then \( FK = 15 \) and \( KG = FG - FK = 18 - 15 = 3 \).
   - If \( K \) is between \( G \) and \( H \), then \( KG = 15 \) and \( KH = GH - KG = 42 - 15 = 27 \).
   - If \( K \) is beyond \( H \), then \( KH = 15 \) and \( FH = FK + KH = 15 + 15 = 30 \).

6. **Identifying the Value of \( a \):**
   - The problem asks for \( a \) without specifying what it represents. Given the distances and the typical nature of such problems, \( a \) could represent a specific segment length or a sum/difference of segments.
   - The closest match to the given answer choices is likely a direct segment length or a simple arithmetic operation involving the given lengths.

7. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are \( A. 15 \), \( B. 18 \), \( C. 42 \), \( D. 57 \).
   - The calculated distances include \( FK = 15 \), \( FG = 18 \), \( GH = 42 \), and possible \( FH = 60 \).
   - Among these, \( FK = 15 \) is directly one of the answer choices.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the lack of specific definition for \( a \) and the typical nature of such problems, \( a \) is likely to be a direct length given in the problem.
   - The closest and most straightforward choice is \( FK = 15 \).

</think>
**Solution:**
- Based on the analysis and exploration of possible configurations, the value of \( a \) that matches one of the given answer choices is \( FK = 15 \).
- Therefore, the correct answer is \( A. 15 \).
