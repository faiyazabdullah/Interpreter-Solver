1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have three circles: Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K).
   - These circles intersect at a common point, Point(L).
   - It is given that the length of Line(G, H) is 10. However, the position of point H is not specified in relation to circle G or any other circle. This might be a typographical or contextual error as it's not clear how H is related to L or J.
   - We need to find the length of Line(J, L).

2. **Identify the Objective:**
   - We are tasked to find the measure of J L, which is the distance from the center of circle J to the intersection point L.

3. **Consider Geometric Properties:**
   - Since all three circles intersect at point L, L is equidistant from the centers of circles G, J, and K.
   - Typically, if multiple circles intersect at a single point, that point is equidistant from all centers of these circles, assuming the circles are not degenerate (i.e., they have non-zero radii and are not coincident).

4. **Apply the Equidistant Property:**
   - Let r_G, r_J, and r_K be the radii of circles G, J, and K, respectively.
   - Since L is a common intersection point, LG = L J = L K.
   - It is given that GH = 10. Without additional context or correction, assume GH refers to a diameter or some length related to circle G that involves L, possibly implying that G L is half of this length (i.e., GL = 5) if GH is a diameter of circle G.

5. **Explore Possible Scenarios:**
   - If GH = 10 represents a diameter of circle G, then the radius of circle G, r_G, would be 5, making GL = 5.
   - By the equidistant property at the intersection point L, LJ should also equal 5 if all circles are identical or have the same radius at least at the intersection point.

6. **Verify and Refine:**
   - Reassess the assumption that GH = 10 could imply a diameter of circle G.
   - If GL = 5 due to this assumption, then LJ must also equal 5 under the equidistant property.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated LJ = 5 matches answer choice A.
   - There is no indication of additional context or correction that would alter the interpretation of GH = 10.

8. **Finalize the Solution:**
   - Based on the analysis and the application of geometric properties, the most consistent interpretation leads to LJ = 5.
</think>

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and the geometric properties of intersecting circles, the most reasonable conclusion is that the distance from the center of circle J to the intersection point L is 5, assuming GH represents a diameter of circle G. Therefore, the measure of J L is 5.
