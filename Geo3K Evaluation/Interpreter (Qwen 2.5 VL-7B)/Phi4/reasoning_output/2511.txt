1. **Analyzing the Given Information**:
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) where \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle. Thus, \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
   - It is given that \( \text{LengthOf}(AB) = \text{LengthOf}(AC) = \text{LengthOf}(BC) \). This implies that the triangle is an isosceles right triangle with equal legs and the hypotenuse.
   - The right angle is at \( B \), so the sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs, and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

2. **Understanding the Constraints**:
   - The equation provided is \( \text{SquareOf}(\text{LengthOf}(AB)) + \text{SquareOf}(\text{LengthOf}(AC)) = \text{SquareOf}(\text{LengthOf}(BC)) \).
   - Since \( AB = AC \) and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, the equation simplifies to:
     \[
     x^2 + x^2 = (x\sqrt{2})^2
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - This equation is always true for any \( x \), confirming the isosceles right triangle property.

3. **Finding the Lengths**:
   - Let \( AB = AC = x \).
   - Then \( BC = x\sqrt{2} \) because in an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg.

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB = AC \), the Pythagorean theorem gives:
     \[
     AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
     \]
   - Substituting the known relationships:
     \[
     x^2 + (x\sqrt{2})^2 = x^2
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     x^2 + 2x^2 = x^2
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3x^2 = x^2
     \]
   - This is incorrect based on the setup, so we need to use:
     \[
     AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
     \]
   - Substituting:
     \[
     x^2 + x^2 = (x\sqrt{2})^2
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     2x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - This confirms the setup is consistent.

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Since \( BC = x\sqrt{2} \) and \( BC = x \), we equate:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = x
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \sqrt{2} = 1
     \]
   - This is incorrect, so we must have misunderstood the setup. Reassess:
   - Actually, \( BC = x\sqrt{2} \) and \( AB = AC = x \).

6. **Calculating \( x \)**:
   - From the equation \( x^2 + x^2 = (x\sqrt{2})^2 \):
     \[
     2x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - This is consistent, so solve for \( x \) using:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = \text{hypotenuse}
     \]
   - If \( x\sqrt{2} = 14.1 \) (hypotenuse), then:
     \[
     x = \frac{14.1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{14.1}{1.414} \approx 9.97
     \]
   - This is not matching directly, so check:
     - \( x\sqrt{2} = 14.1 \) implies:
     \[
     x = \frac{14.1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 9.97
     \]

7. **Choosing the Closest Answer**:
   - The closest answer to \( 9.97 \) is \( 7.1 \) when considering rounding and the given options.

<Solution>
Given the constraints and calculations, the closest answer choice to the calculated \( x \approx 9.97 \) is \( 7.1 \).
