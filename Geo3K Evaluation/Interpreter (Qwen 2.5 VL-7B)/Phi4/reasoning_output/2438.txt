**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a parallelogram \(WRSV\) with points \(W, R, S, V\).
   - \( \angle WRS \) and \( \angle SRT \) are right angles, indicating that \(WRS\) and \(SRT\) form two right triangles.
   - The lines \(WR\), \(RS\), \(SV\), and \(VT\) are all equal in length.
   - We need to find the length of \(WR\).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Since \( \angle WRS \) is a right angle, \(WRS\) forms a right triangle.
   - Similarly, \( \angle SRT \) being a right angle means \(SRT\) is also a right triangle.
   - The equality of the lengths \(WR = RS = SV = VT\) suggests that these segments form the sides of squares or rhombuses.

3. **Identify the Shape:**
   - Given the right angles and equal lengths, \(WRSV\) could be a square or a rhombus.
   - Since \( \angle WRS \) is a right angle, \(WRSV\) must be a square.

4. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - In a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.
   - The diagonals of a square are equal and can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by half the square.

5. **Calculate the Diagonal:**
   - Let the side of the square be \(x\).
   - The diagonal \(WT\) (or \(RV\)) can be calculated as \(x\sqrt{2}\) using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(WRS\).

6. **Relate Diagonal to Given Equal Lengths:**
   - Since \(WR = RS = SV = VT = x\), and \(WT = RV = x\sqrt{2}\), we can use the fact that \(WT = 2x\) (since \(WT\) is the diagonal of the square formed by two equal segments \(WR\) and \(RS\)).

7. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - From \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\), solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = 2x \implies \sqrt{2} = 2 \implies x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}
     \]
   - This calculation seems incorrect; let's re-evaluate:
     - \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\) implies \(x(\sqrt{2} - 2) = 0\), which is incorrect for non-zero \(x\).
     - Reconsider: \(WT = \sqrt{WR^2 + RS^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}\).

8. **Correct Calculation:**
   - \(WT = 2x\) implies \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\).
   - Solving \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\) gives \(x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}}\), simplifying to \(x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \times \sqrt{2} = 2\).

9. **Verify and Choose Closest Answer:**
   - Recalculate using \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\):
     - \(x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} \implies x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \times \sqrt{2} = 2\).
   - If \(x = 6\), then \(x\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.49\), close to 8.
   - If \(x = 8\), then \(x\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2} \approx 11.31\), close to 12.
   - If \(x = 10\), then \(x\sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14\), not close to any.
   - If \(x = 12\), then \(x\sqrt{2} = 12\sqrt{2} \approx 16.97\), not close to any.

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The closest match for \(x\sqrt{2} = 2x\) is when \(x = 8\), making \(x\sqrt{2} \approx 11.31\), closest to 12.

**Solution Section:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \(WR\) that satisfies the geometric constraints and is closest to the given answer choices is when \(x = 8\).
