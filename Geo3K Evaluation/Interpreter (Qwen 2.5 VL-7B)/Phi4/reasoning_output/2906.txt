### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints**

We have two sets of angle sum constraints:
1. \(2x + 1 + 5x + 5 = 180\)
2. \(y^2 + 3y + 10 = 180\)

These are linear and quadratic equations, respectively, which are typical in problems involving angles in geometric figures.

**Step 2: Understand the problem context**

The problem states that quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle. In a rectangle, each angle is \(90^\circ\). This information is crucial because it implies that the angles we are dealing with in the constraints must relate to the properties of a rectangle.

**Step 3: Solve the first equation**

The first equation is:
\[2x + 1 + 5x + 5 = 180\]

Combine like terms:
\[7x + 6 = 180\]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[7x = 174\]

Divide by 7:
\[x = \frac{174}{7} = 24.8571\]

This value does not match any of the answer choices directly, but we will consider it in the context of the problem.

**Step 4: Solve the second equation**

The second equation is:
\[y^2 + 3y + 10 = 180\]

Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[y^2 + 3y - 170 = 0\]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = 3\), \(c = -170\).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-170) = 9 + 680 = 689\]

The roots are:
\[y = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{689}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{689}\) is not a perfect square, the roots are irrational. However, this equation is not directly related to finding \(x\).

**Step 5: Reassess the problem context**

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the angles \(2x + 1\) and \(5x + 5\) must relate to the properties of a rectangle. The sum of angles in a rectangle is \(360^\circ\), and each angle is \(90^\circ\).

The equation \(2x + 1 + 5x + 5 = 180\) suggests these two angles are supplementary, which is consistent with opposite angles in a rectangle.

**Step 6: Verify the calculation**

The calculation for \(x\) was:
\[x = \frac{174}{7} = 24.8571\]

The closest integer value to this is 25, which is one of the answer choices.

**Step 7: Select the closest answer**

Given the calculated value of \(x \approx 24.8571\), the closest integer from the answer choices is 25.

**Step 8: Finalize the solution**

The solution is consistent with the properties of a rectangle and the given constraints. The closest answer choice is 25.

**Solution:**

1. Solve the equation \(2x + 1 + 5x + 5 = 180\):
   \[
   7x + 6 = 180 \implies 7x = 174 \implies x = \frac{174}{7} = 24.8571
   \]

2. The closest integer value to \(24.8571\) is 25.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is:
