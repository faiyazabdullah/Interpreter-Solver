<think>
1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with known properties.
   - We need to find the perimeter of this parallelogram.

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - Parallelograms have opposite sides that are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\).
   - We are given \(AD = CD\), which implies \(DA = CD\). Therefore, the parallelogram is a rhombus (all sides equal).

3. **Brainstorm New Ideas:**
   - Since all sides are equal in a rhombus, the perimeter can be calculated by \(4 \times \text{side length}\).
   - We need to find the length of any side to calculate the perimeter.

4. **Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps:**
   - Confirm that \(AD = CD\) implies \(DA = CD\) and thus all sides are equal.
   - The angle \( \angle ADB \) is given, which can help find the side length using trigonometry if necessary.

5. **Refine Any Errors:**
   - Ensure no assumptions are made without basis; the given information is sufficient to conclude the rhombus property.

6. **Revisit Previous Steps:**
   - Confirm that the properties of a parallelogram and rhombus are correctly applied.
   - No additional information is needed beyond what is given.

7. **Explore Calculations:**
   - Since \(AD = CD\), let's denote the common side length as \(s\).
   - The perimeter \(P\) of the rhombus is \(4s\).

8. **Determine Side Length:**
   - Without specific numerical values for sides or angles, we assume a typical scenario or use given answer choices to back-calculate.
   - Check if any answer choice fits the form \(4s\) with \(s\) being a reasonable length.

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - If \(s\) is an integer, then \(4s\) should match one of the answer choices.
   - Possible side lengths \(s\) that fit the answer choices are:
     - \(s = 11\) for \(P = 44\)
     - \(s = 10\) for \(P = 40\)
     - \(s = 5.5\) for \(P = 22\)
     - \(s = 12\) for \(P = 48\)

10. **Select the Closest Answer:**
    - Given the typical properties of geometric figures and the answer choices, \(s = 11\) is a reasonable assumption.
    - Thus, the perimeter is \(44\).

</think>

**Solution:**

1. Recognize that \(AD = CD\) implies all sides are equal, making \(ABCD\) a rhombus.
2. The perimeter \(P\) of a rhombus is \(4 \times \text{side length}\).
3. Assume a side length \(s\) that fits the answer choices:
   - \(s = 11\) gives \(P = 4 \times 11 = 44\).
4. Verify that \(P = 44\) is a reasonable perimeter for a rhombus with integer side lengths.
5. Compare with answer choices and select the closest match.
