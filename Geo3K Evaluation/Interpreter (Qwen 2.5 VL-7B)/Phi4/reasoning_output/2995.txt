1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given that \(\triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY\), which means these two triangles are congruent. By the definition of congruent triangles, all corresponding sides and angles are equal.
   - We are also given that \(\angle BCD = \angle WY\).
   - Additionally, \(BC = WY\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\). However, the problem does not specify what \(x\) represents. We need to infer \(x\) based on the information given and the congruence relationship.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since the triangles are congruent, we can write the corresponding parts:
     - \(BC = WY\)
     - \(CD = XY\)
     - \(BD = WX\)
     - \(\angle BCD = \angle WY\)
     - \(\angle CBD = \angle XYW\)
     - \(\angle BDC = \angle XWY\)

4. **Explore Possible Interpretations:**
   - Since \(x\) is not directly defined, we consider it might be related to one of the sides or angles of the triangles.
   - Given \(BC = WY\), \(x\) could potentially be a value related to the length of one of these segments or an angle measure.

5. **Reassess the Information:**
   - Since \(BC = WY\) and \(\angle BCD = \angle WY\), \(x\) might be a component of these equalities.
   - If \(x\) is a length, it could be a part of \(BC\) or \(WY\).
   - If \(x\) is an angle measure, it could be part of \(\angle BCD\) or \(\angle WY\).

6. **Reflect on Possible Calculations:**
   - Without specific numerical values for sides or angles, we need to consider a logical approach.
   - Since \(BC = WY\) and \(\angle BCD = \angle WY\), and no specific numerical values are given, \(x\) could be a simple integer value representing a side length or angle measure.

7. **Backtrace and Iterate:**
   - Given the lack of specific numerical data, we assume \(x\) is a simple integer value.
   - The problem might be testing basic understanding of congruence and equality.

8. **Final Consideration:**
   - Since \(BC = WY\) and \(\angle BCD = \angle WY\), and no other specific values are given, \(x\) could be a simple representation of these equalities.
   - The simplest integer value that could represent a side length or angle measure in a basic congruence problem is often a small integer.

9. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the choices A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5, and the lack of specific numerical data, the simplest assumption is that \(x\) is a small integer.
   - The most straightforward assumption is \(x = 2\), as it is the smallest integer and often used in basic geometric problems.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, \(x\) is likely a simple integer value representing a side length or angle measure in the congruent triangles. Given the lack of specific numerical data, the simplest assumption is \(x = 2\), which aligns with basic geometric principles of congruence and equality.
