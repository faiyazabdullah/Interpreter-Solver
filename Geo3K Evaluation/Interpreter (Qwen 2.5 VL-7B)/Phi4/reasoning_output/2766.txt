**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC \) being the right angle. The lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal, and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse. The problem states:

- \( AB = BC \)
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse
- \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

We need to find the value of \( x \), which is implied to be the square of the hypotenuse \( AC \) since the problem involves calculating \( AC^2 \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB = BC \), it is an isosceles right triangle. For an isosceles right triangle, if the legs are of length \( a \), then the hypotenuse \( c \) is given by:

\[ c = a\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, the square of the hypotenuse is:

\[ c^2 = (a\sqrt{2})^2 = 2a^2 \]

**Step 4: Calculate Using Given Conditions**

Given \( AB = BC \), let \( AB = BC = a \).

According to the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \]

Substitute \( AB = BC = a \):

\[ AC^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2 \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

We need to find \( x = AC^2 = 2a^2 \). Since the problem does not provide specific lengths, we assume \( a^2 \) is such that \( 2a^2 \) matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 6: Determine the Closest Answer**

The answer choices are 16, 17, 18, and 19. We need to find which of these is a plausible value for \( 2a^2 \).

- If \( 2a^2 = 16 \), then \( a^2 = 8 \).
- If \( 2a^2 = 18 \), then \( a^2 = 9 \).

Since \( a^2 = 9 \) is a perfect square (i.e., \( a = 3 \)), it is a reasonable assumption for the side length of an isosceles right triangle.

Thus, \( 2a^2 = 18 \) is the most reasonable choice.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

Based on the calculations and reasoning, the closest and most reasonable value for \( x \) is 18.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the value of \( x \) is 18. Therefore, the correct answer is:
