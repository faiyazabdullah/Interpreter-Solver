**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Constraints**

- We have a parallelogram \(JKLM\).
- Given:
  - \( \angle JRL = \angle KRL \)
  - \( JK = LM \)
  - \( KL = KM \)
  - \( JK = KL \)

**Step 2: Summarizing Relevant Findings**

- Since \(JK = KL\), the parallelogram \(JKLM\) becomes a rhombus because all sides of a rhombus are equal.
- In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
- Given \( \angle JRL = \angle KRL \), point \(R\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle JKL\).

**Step 3: Applying Geometric Properties**

- In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Since \(R\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle JKL\), and \(JK = KL\), \(\triangle JKL\) is isosceles with \(JK = KL\).
- The angle bisector of an isosceles triangle divides the vertex angle into two equal angles.

**Step 4: Calculating \(\angle KJL\)**

- Let \(\angle JKL = 2x\).
- Since \(\angle JRL = \angle KRL\), \(R\) is on the angle bisector, so \(\angle JRL = \angle KRL = x\).
- In \(\triangle JKL\), since it is isosceles with \(JK = KL\), \(\angle KJL = \angle KLJ\).
- The sum of angles in \(\triangle JKL\) is \(180^\circ\):
  \[
  \angle KJL + \angle KLJ + \angle JKL = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  2\angle KJL + 2x = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  2\angle KJL = 180^\circ - 2x
  \]
  \[
  \angle KJL = 90^\circ - x
  \]

**Step 5: Determining \(x\)**

- Since \(R\) is on the angle bisector and \(\angle JRL = \angle KRL\), and \(JK = KL\), \(\angle JKL\) is bisected into two equal angles.
- In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Therefore, \(\angle JKL = 2x\) is bisected by the diagonal \(JR\) and \(KR\).
- Since \(JK = KL\) and \(R\) is on the angle bisector, \(\angle JKL = 90^\circ\) because diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles into \(45^\circ\).

**Step 6: Calculating \(\angle KJL\)**

- Since \(\angle JKL = 90^\circ\), \(x = 45^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle KJL = 90^\circ - x = 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ\).

**Step 7: Comparing with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(\angle KJL = 45^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice to \(45^\circ\) is \(40^\circ\).

**Step 8: Finalizing the Answer**

- Based on the calculations and the closest match to the answer choices, the correct choice is \(40^\circ\).

</think>

**Solution:**

The calculated measure of \(\angle KJL\) is \(45^\circ\), and the closest answer choice is \(40^\circ\).
