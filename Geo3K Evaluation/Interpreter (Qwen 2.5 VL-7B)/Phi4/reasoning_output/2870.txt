1. **Analyze the Given Constraints**:
   - We have a quadrilateral ABCD with all sides equal (AB = BC = CD = DA), which indicates that ABCD is a rhombus or a square.
   - We have specific angles mentioned: ∠ABC and ∠ADE (which is likely ∠DAE since E isn't defined as a point on the quadrilateral).
   - We need to find the measure of ∠2.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We are asked to find the measure of ∠2. However, there is no direct mention of what ∠2 represents in the context of the diagram. We need to infer this from the given information.

3. **Explore Geometric Properties**:
   - In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
   - In a square, all angles are 90 degrees.
   - Since all sides are equal, and no additional information suggests right angles, we should consider the properties of a rhombus.

4. **Consider the Role of ∠2**:
   - Without a specific diagram, we assume ∠2 is related to the angles given, possibly involving diagonals or internal angles.
   - In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles and bisect the angles of the rhombus.

5. **Apply Relevant Theorems**:
   - If ∠2 is formed by a diagonal intersecting at point A or another vertex, it could be half of one of the angles of the rhombus.
   - The sum of angles in any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. If ABCD is a rhombus, let each angle be θ. Then, 2θ + 2(180° - θ) = 360°, which simplifies to θ = 90° if it were a square. Otherwise, θ can vary.

6. **Calculate Possible Values**:
   - If ∠2 is half of an angle formed by the diagonals, and assuming the rhombus is not a square, each angle θ could be something like 60° or 120°, making ∠2 = 30° or 60°.
   - If ∠2 is related to the bisected angle at a vertex, and assuming a typical rhombus angle like 60° or 120°, ∠2 could be 30° or 60°.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The closest values to our calculated possibilities (30° or 60°) among the choices are 28° and 33°.
   - Given the constraints and typical rhombus properties, 33° is a reasonable approximation for an angle bisected by a diagonal in a non-square rhombus.

8. **Reassess and Refine**:
   - Reconsidering the properties of a rhombus and typical angle measures, 33° fits as a plausible measure for an angle bisected by a diagonal in a rhombus with non-right angles.

9. **Final Decision**:
   - Based on the analysis and comparison, the closest and most reasonable choice for ∠2 is 33°.

Solution:
Given the properties of a rhombus and the typical angle measures, ∠2, likely formed by a diagonal bisecting an angle, is closest to 33°. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D. 33
