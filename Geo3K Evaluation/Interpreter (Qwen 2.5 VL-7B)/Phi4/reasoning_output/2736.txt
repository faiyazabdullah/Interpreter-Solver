1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The problem provides an equation: \(2x + 9 = 3x + 6\).
   - It mentions a segment tangent to a circle but does not give further details about the circle or segment. It implies we need to find \(x\) using the given equation.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - The equation \(2x + 9 = 3x + 6\) is the main focus.
   - No additional geometric data or properties are directly provided or needed to solve for \(x\), given the equation is sufficient.

3. **Exploring New Ideas:**
   - Solve the equation algebraically to find the value of \(x\).

4. **Verification of Steps:**
   - Rearrange the equation: \(2x + 9 = 3x + 6\).
   - Subtract \(2x\) from both sides: \(9 = x + 6\).
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \(3 = x\).

5. **Refining and Reassessing:**
   - Verify the algebraic manipulation is correct.
   - Check if any assumptions or additional geometric implications were overlooked: None required, as the equation alone determines \(x\).

6. **Backtracing and Iteration:**
   - Reassess the solution to ensure no logical errors: The solution path is straightforward and correct.
   - The solution solely relies on solving the equation provided.

<Solution>

To solve the equation \(2x + 9 = 3x + 6\):

1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 9 = 3x + 6
   \]

2. Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:
   \[
   9 = x + 6
   \]

3. Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3 = x
   \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is 3.

Comparing with the provided answer choices, the correct option is B. 3.
