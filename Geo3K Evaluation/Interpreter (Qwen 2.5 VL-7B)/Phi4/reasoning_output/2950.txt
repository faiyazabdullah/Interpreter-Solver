**Step 1: Analyze the Question and Given Information**
- We are given that point D is the center of a circle, and we need to find the measure of \(\angle ABC\).
- This suggests that points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the circle, with D as the center.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle ABC\), which is an inscribed angle in the circle.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- An important theorem in circle geometry is that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- If \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtending arc AC, then \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle ADC\).

**Step 4: Consider Possible Scenarios**
- Since no specific measurements are given for the angles or arcs, we consider standard scenarios:
  - If \(\angle ADC\) is a right angle (90 degrees), then \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45\) degrees.
  - If \(\angle ADC\) is 60 degrees, then \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30\) degrees.
  - If \(\angle ADC\) is 120 degrees, then \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 = 60\) degrees.
  - If \(\angle ADC\) is 180 degrees (a semicircle), then \(\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90\) degrees.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine**
- The problem does not specify the exact configuration, but the most common scenario in such problems is when \(\angle ADC\) is 90 degrees, making \(\angle ABC = 45\) degrees.
- This is a common configuration in geometry problems involving circles, where a diameter subtends a right angle at the circumference.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated possible values for \(\angle ABC\) are 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees.
- These match the answer choices A, B, C, and D respectively.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**
- Based on typical geometric configurations and the standard problem setup, \(\angle ABC = 45\) degrees is a plausible and common result.

<Solution>
- Given the analysis and typical geometric configurations, the most reasonable measure for \(\angle ABC\) is 45 degrees.
- Therefore, the correct answer is B.
