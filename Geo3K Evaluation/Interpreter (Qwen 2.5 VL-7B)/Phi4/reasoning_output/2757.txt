### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We are given angles with specific measures in terms of variables \( p \) and \( r \):
     - \( m \angle 1 = 4p + 15 \)
     - \( m \angle 3 = 3p - 10 \)
     - \( m \angle 4 = 6r + 5 \)
   - We are also given geometric constraints involving these angles, specifically \( \text{Angle}(A,1,3) \), \( \text{Angle}(A,2,3) \), and \( \text{Angle}(A,3,4) \).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( p \).

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The notation \( \text{Angle}(A,1,3) \) suggests that angles 1 and 3 are related, possibly forming a linear pair or being supplementary.
   - Similarly, \( \text{Angle}(A,3,4) \) suggests a relationship between angles 3 and 4.

4. **Exploring Possible Relationships:**
   - If angles 1 and 3 form a linear pair, then \( m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 180^\circ \).
   - If angles 3 and 4 form a linear pair, then \( m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ \).

5. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - From \( m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 180^\circ \):
     \[
     (4p + 15) + (3p - 10) = 180
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     7p + 5 = 180
     \]
     \[
     7p = 175
     \]
     \[
     p = 25
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Check if this value of \( p \) satisfies the other possible relationship \( m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ \):
     - Calculate \( m \angle 3 \) with \( p = 25 \):
       \[
       m \angle 3 = 3(25) - 10 = 75 - 10 = 65
       \]
     - Set up the equation for \( m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ \):
       \[
       65 + (6r + 5) = 180
       \]
       \[
       6r + 70 = 180
       \]
       \[
       6r = 110
       \]
       \[
       r = \frac{110}{6} \approx 18.33
       \]
   - The value of \( r \) is not an integer, but since we only need to find \( p \), this does not affect the validity of \( p = 25 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the given constraints, and \( p = 25 \) satisfies the primary equation derived from the linear pair relationship.

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( p \) that satisfies the given geometric constraints is \( p = 25 \).
