**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have two triangles: Triangle(L,M,N) and Triangle(M,N,P).
- Points L, M, N, P are specified, with lines LM, MN, and NP defined.
- Two right angles are given: Angle(L,M,N) is a right angle, and Angle(M,N,P) is a right angle.
- We are given that m∠9 = 75°, and we need to find the measure of ∠6.
- Angles 6 and 9 are adjacent.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since Angle(L,M,N) is a right angle, ∠LMN = 90°.
- Since Angle(M,N,P) is a right angle, ∠MNP = 90°.
- Since angles 6 and 9 are adjacent and part of the same linear configuration, they must add up to 180° (straight line property).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- By the linear pair theorem, adjacent angles on a straight line sum up to 180°.
- Therefore, ∠6 + ∠9 = 180°.

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**
- Substitute the given measure of ∠9 into the equation: ∠6 + 75° = 180°.
- Solve for ∠6: ∠6 = 180° - 75° = 105°.

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of ∠6 is 105°.
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 75, B. 85, C. 95, D. 105.
- The closest and exact match is 105°, which corresponds to choice D.

**Step 6: Verify and Reassess**
- Reassess calculations and geometric properties: The linear pair theorem and the given right angles confirm the setup.
- The calculation of ∠6 as 105° aligns with the geometric constraints and given data.

**Step 7: Final Reflection**
- Ensure no steps or considerations were overlooked.
- The problem setup and calculations are consistent with geometric principles.
