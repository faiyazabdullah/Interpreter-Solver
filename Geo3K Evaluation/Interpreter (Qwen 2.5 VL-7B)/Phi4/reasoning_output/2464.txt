**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a right triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with \( \angle XYZ \) being the right angle.
- Line \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \( XZ \).
- Point \( W \) is the midpoint of line \( XZ \).
- The length \( WZ = 14.9 \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find the length \( WX \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \) and \( W \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \), it follows that \( WX = WZ \).
- This is because the perpendicular bisector of a segment divides it into two equal parts.

**Step 4: Verify the Calculations**

- Given \( WZ = 14.9 \) and \( WX = WZ \), we have \( WX = 14.9 \).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length \( WX = 14.9 \) matches exactly with choice B.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

- Since \( WX = 14.9 \) matches exactly with choice B, we select B.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- The calculations and logic confirm that the length \( WX \) is indeed 14.9.

**Solution:**

Given that line \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \( XZ \) and \( W \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \), it follows that \( WX = WZ \). Since \( WZ = 14.9 \), we have \( WX = 14.9 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
