1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a parallelogram with vertices A, B, C, and D, forming lines AB, BC, CD, and DA.
   - By definition of a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel, so \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(BC \parallel DA\).
   - It is stated that \(\angle A\) is a right angle. This implies that the parallelogram is actually a rectangle since one of its angles is \(90^\circ\).
   - We are given the height of triangle ABC, which implies we can use this to find the length of one of the sides.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the perimeter of the parallelogram. The perimeter \(P\) of a parallelogram (or rectangle in this case) is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems, Properties, and Formulas:**
   - Since \(\angle A\) is a right angle, triangle ABC is a right triangle with \(\angle A = 90^\circ\).
   - The height of triangle ABC can be considered as the perpendicular from A to line BC. Let's denote this height as \(h\).
   - In a right triangle, the area can also be calculated using the base and height. If we assume \(AB = a\) (one side of the rectangle) and \(BC = b\) (the other side of the rectangle), the area of triangle ABC can be calculated in two ways:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times \text{Height}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
     \]
   - Equating these two expressions for the area, we have:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
     \]
     \[
     h = b
     \]
   - This implies that the height of triangle ABC is equal to side \(BC\).

4. **Consider Additional Information:**
   - Since we have not been given specific numerical values for the sides or the height, we need to assume or deduce these from the answer choices.
   - Let's assume \(AB = a\) and \(BC = b\), then the perimeter is:
     \[
     P = 2(a + b)
     \]

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Given Answer Choices:**
   - We need to find integer values for \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(2(a + b)\) matches one of the given answer choices.
   - Testing possible values:
     - If \(a = 17\) and \(b = 15\), then:
       \[
       P = 2(17 + 15) = 2 \times 32 = 64
       \]
     - If \(a = 18\) and \(b = 16\), then:
       \[
       P = 2(18 + 16) = 2 \times 34 = 68
       \]
     - If \(a = 19\) and \(b = 17\), then:
       \[
       P = 2(19 + 17) = 2 \times 36 = 72
       \]
     - If \(a = 20\) and \(b = 18\), then:
       \[
       P = 2(20 + 18) = 2 \times 38 = 76
       \]

6. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - From the calculations, the closest perimeter to the given answer choices is 68.
