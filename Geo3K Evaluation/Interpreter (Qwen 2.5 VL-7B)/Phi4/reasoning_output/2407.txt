### Step 1: Analyze the Problem

The problem involves a pentagon \(ABCDE\) and the angles at each vertex. We are given the sum of the measures of the internal angles of the pentagon:

- \( \angle ABC \)
- \( \angle BCD \)
- \( \angle CDE \)
- \( \angle DEA \)
- \( \angle EAB \)

We need to find the value of \(x\), which is presumably related to these angles.

### Step 2: Recall Relevant Geometric Properties

For any polygon, the sum of the interior angles can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\(n = 5\)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation

The problem states that we are to find the sum of the measures of the angles:
\[
\angle ABC + \angle BCD + \angle CDE + \angle DEA + \angle EAB = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Identify What Needs to Be Found

The problem asks for the value of \(x\). Given the context, \(x\) is likely the sum of the measures of these angles, which we have calculated as \(540^\circ\).

### Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices

The calculated sum of the angles is \(540^\circ\). We need to select the closest value from the given answer choices:

- A. 56
- B. 68
- C. 74
- D. 84

### Step 6: Choose the Closest Answer

Since \(540\) is not directly listed, we need to consider the context or any possible misinterpretation. Given the options, none are close to \(540\). However, if \(x\) was meant to represent something else (e.g., an average or a specific angle measure), we would need additional context.

Given the lack of other information, and assuming \(x\) is indeed the sum of the angles, the problem might be testing understanding of the sum of angles in a polygon. Since \(540\) is not an option, we must choose the closest logical choice based on typical exam scenarios where a misinterpretation might occur.

### Step 7: Final Decision

Given the options and the typical nature of such problems, it seems \(x\) might be a misinterpretation or simplification error. The closest logical choice, considering typical exam scenarios, might be to choose the highest available option, assuming a simplification or error in the problem setup.

**Final Answer: D**
