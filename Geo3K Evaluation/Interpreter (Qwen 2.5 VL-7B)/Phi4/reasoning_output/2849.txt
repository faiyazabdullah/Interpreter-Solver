**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and what needs to be found.**
- We are given two angles, \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \).
- \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are bisected by lines \( r \) and \( s \) respectively, which implies that \( \angle 4 = \angle 5 \).
- We have expressions for these angles: \( m \angle 4 = 2y + 32 \) and \( m \angle 5 = 3y - 3 \).
- We need to find the value of \( y \).

**Step 2: Set up the equation based on the equality of the angles.**
- Since \( \angle 4 = \angle 5 \), we can set the expressions for these angles equal to each other:
  \[
  2y + 32 = 3y - 3
  \]

**Step 3: Solve the equation for \( y \).**
- Rearrange the equation to isolate \( y \):
  \[
  2y + 32 = 3y - 3
  \]
- Subtract \( 2y \) from both sides:
  \[
  32 = y - 3
  \]
- Add 3 to both sides to solve for \( y \):
  \[
  35 = y
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**
- Substitute \( y = 35 \) back into the expressions for \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) to ensure they are equal:
  - \( m \angle 4 = 2(35) + 32 = 70 + 32 = 102 \)
  - \( m \angle 5 = 3(35) - 3 = 105 - 3 = 102 \)
- Both angles are indeed equal, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 5: Compare with answer choices.**
- The calculated value of \( y \) is 35.
- Check the answer choices: A. 18, B. 35, C. 55, D. 72.
- The correct choice is B. 35.

<Solution>

The given problem involves two angles that are equal due to being bisected by lines. By setting the expressions for these angles equal to each other and solving for \( y \), we find that \( y = 35 \). Verification confirms that both angles are equal when \( y = 35 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
