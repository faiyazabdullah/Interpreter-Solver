**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- We are given a circle \(\odot P\) with center \(P\).
- The points \(J\), \(K\), \(L\), \(M\), and \(N\) are on the circumference of the circle.
- Line \(NP\) is perpendicular to line \(PL\). This implies \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).
- \(\angle MLP = 65^\circ\).
- \(NJK\) is an arc of the circle.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of the arc \(NJK\), denoted as \(m \widehat{NJK}\).

**Step 3: Analyze the Geometry**
- Since \(NP \perp PL\), \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).
- The angle \(\angle MLP = 65^\circ\) is given.
- In a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.

**Step 4: Apply Relevant Theorems**
- The angle \(\angle MLP\) is an inscribed angle that subtends arc \(NL\).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \(NL\) is \(2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ\).

**Step 5: Determine the Measure of Arc \(NJK\)**
- Since \(NPL\) is a right angle, the arc \(NL\) subtends this angle at the center.
- The arc \(NL\) is \(130^\circ\), and since \(NPL\) is a right angle, the remaining arc \(LJN\) must be \(360^\circ - 130^\circ = 230^\circ\).
- The arc \(NJK\) is the part of the circle from \(N\) to \(K\) passing through \(J\), which is the complement of arc \(NL\) in the semicircle formed by \(NPL\).
- Since \(NPL\) is \(90^\circ\), the arc \(NL\) is \(130^\circ\), and the arc \(LJN\) is \(230^\circ\), the arc \(NJK\) is the remaining part of the semicircle not covered by \(NL\).
- The semicircle \(NPL\) is \(180^\circ\), so the arc \(NJK\) is \(180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ\).

**Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of arc \(NJK\) is \(115^\circ\).
- Compare this with the answer choices: 25, 75, 90, 155.
- The closest choice to \(115^\circ\) is \(75^\circ\).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**
- Based on the calculations, the closest answer choice is \(75^\circ\).

</think>

**Solution:**
- The measure of arc \(NJK\) is calculated to be \(115^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice to \(115^\circ\) is \(75^\circ\).
