**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We have two triangles: \(\triangle LMN\) and \(\triangle QRS\). The problem states that these triangles are congruent (\(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\)). Congruence implies that all corresponding sides and angles are equal.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the value of \(x\). However, the problem does not directly define \(x\). We need to infer what \(x\) represents based on the given information and congruence.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

Since \(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\), we have:
- \(LM = QR\)
- \(MN = RS\)
- \(NL = SQ\)
- \(\angle LMN = \angle QRS\)
- \(\angle MNL = \angle RQS\)
- \(\angle NLM = \angle SQR\)

**Step 4: Consider the Given Angles**

The problem states:
- \(\angle LMN = \angle QRS\)
- \(\angle QRS = x\)

Since \(\angle LMN = \angle QRS\) and \(\angle QRS = x\), it follows that \(\angle LMN = x\).

**Step 5: Use the Congruence Information**

Since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, if \(\angle LMN = x\), then \(\angle QRS = x\).

**Step 6: Determine the Value of \(x\)**

The problem does not provide specific angle measures, but it implies that \(x\) is the measure of \(\angle QRS\) (and \(\angle LMN\)). Without additional numerical information, we must assume \(x\) is a specific value that fits the context of typical angle measures in congruent triangles.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

Given the answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 5
- C. 7
- D. 18

Typical angle measures in a triangle are between 0 and 180 degrees. Among the choices, 18 degrees is a reasonable measure for an angle in a triangle, especially if the triangles are not specified to be right or equilateral.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

Since no specific numerical values are provided for the angles, and 18 is a reasonable angle measure in a triangle, we select 18 as the closest plausible value for \(x\).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the congruence \(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\) and the information that \(\angle LMN = \angle QRS = x\), we deduce that \(x\) is the measure of these corresponding angles. Without specific numerical values provided, we choose the most reasonable angle measure from the given options, which is 18 degrees.
