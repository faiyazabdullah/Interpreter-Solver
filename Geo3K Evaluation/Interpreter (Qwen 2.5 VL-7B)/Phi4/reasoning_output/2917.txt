**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a right triangle \( \triangle RST \) with right angle at \( R \).
- The lengths of the legs \( RS \) and \( ST \) are equal: \( RS = ST \).
- \( RT \) is the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find \( TQ \), which is not directly defined in the problem. We assume \( TQ \) refers to the length of the hypotenuse \( RT \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle with \( RS = ST \), it is an isosceles right triangle.
- In an isosceles right triangle, the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by the Pythagorean theorem: \( RT = \sqrt{RS^2 + ST^2} \).
- Since \( RS = ST \), let \( RS = ST = x \).
- Then, \( RT = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse**

- We need to find the numerical value of \( RT \) (or \( TQ \)) using the given answer choices.
- Assume \( x = 6 \) (since \( RS = ST \) and we need to match one of the answer choices).
- Then, \( RT = 6\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 5: Approximate \( 6\sqrt{2} \)**

- Calculate \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \).
- Therefore, \( RT = 6 \times 1.414 \approx 8.484 \).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( RT \approx 8.484 \).
- Compare with the given choices: A. 6, B. 7, C. 12, D. 18.
- The closest value to 8.484 is 7.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Based on the approximation, the closest answer choice to \( 8.484 \) is 7.

**Solution:**

- Given the constraints and calculations, the closest value to \( 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.484 \) is 7.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
