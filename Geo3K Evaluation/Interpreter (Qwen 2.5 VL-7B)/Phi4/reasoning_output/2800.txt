### Thought Process

1. **Analyzing Given Information:**
   - We have a parallelogram \(ABCN\).
   - The given constraints include the lengths of sides \(AN\), \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CN\), as well as the area of the parallelogram.
   - We are asked to find the area of the parallelogram \(ABCN\) using these lengths.

2. **Understanding Parallelogram Properties:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CN\) and \(BC = AN\).
   - The area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}\).
   - Alternatively, the area can also be calculated using the formula involving the sine of the angle between two sides: \(\text{Area} = ab \sin(\theta)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are adjacent sides and \(\theta\) is the angle between them.

3. **Given Constraints:**
   - We have the expression \(\text{Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,N))}\), which suggests multiplying the length of \(AN\) by some factor.
   - This factor could be related to the height or the sine of the angle between \(AN\) and \(AB\).

4. **Exploring the Problem:**
   - Since we are given the lengths of all sides, we can use the formula involving the sine of the angle between two sides.
   - We need to find the angle \(\theta\) between \(AN\) and \(AB\) to use the formula \(\text{Area} = AN \times AB \times \sin(\theta)\).

5. **Reassessing the Given Information:**
   - The problem does not provide the angle directly, but we can infer that the multiplication factor involves the sine of the angle.
   - The expression \(\text{Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,N))}\) suggests that the area calculation involves multiplying \(AN\) by another length or factor.

6. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Assume the factor \(\text{Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,N))}\) is \(AB \times \sin(\theta)\).
   - Therefore, the area can be expressed as: \(\text{Area} = AN \times (AB \times \sin(\theta))\).

7. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - We need to calculate the area using the given lengths and the multiplication factor.
   - Without specific numerical values for the lengths, we assume the multiplication factor provides the necessary component to calculate the area.

8. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - We need to compare the calculated area with the given answer choices: 972, 1080, 1440, and 2412.
   - Since we are not given specific numerical values, we rely on the structure of the problem to guide us to the closest answer.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the structure and typical values for such problems, the area is likely to be a rounded value close to one of the given choices.
   - The multiplication factor likely ensures that the area is a reasonable value within the provided options.

10. **Final Calculation:**
    - Assume typical values for side lengths and angles in a parallelogram to estimate the area.
    - Given the structure of the problem, the closest reasonable estimate for the area is 1440.

### Solution

Given the geometric constraints and typical properties of a parallelogram, we use the formula for the area involving the sine of the angle between two sides. The expression \(\text{Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,N))}\) suggests multiplying \(AN\) by \(AB \times \sin(\theta)\), which gives us the area directly.

By estimating typical values and comparing with the given answer choices, the closest and most reasonable estimate for the area of the parallelogram \(ABCN\) is 1440.
