**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We are given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at point \(E\).
   - We know that \(\angle ABC = \angle 2\) and \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle 3\), which is supplementary to \(\angle 2\).

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and all angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
   - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal.
   - \(\angle ABC\) is part of the rectangle, so \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).

3. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \(\angle 2\) is part of \(\angle ABC\), and \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), we have:
     \[
     \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Given \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\), we can find \(\angle 3\) by:
     \[
     \angle 3 = 90^\circ - \angle 2 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
     \]

4. **Verification and Reflection:**
   - Verify the calculation: \(\angle 3 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ\).
   - Check if \(\angle 3\) being supplementary to \(\angle 2\) (i.e., \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 90^\circ\)) holds true.

5. **Reassessment:**
   - The calculation aligns with the properties of a rectangle and the given conditions.
   - No errors detected in the reasoning process.

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \(\angle 3\) is \(50^\circ\).
   - Among the answer choices, \(50^\circ\) corresponds to option C.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated result matches one of the provided answer choices.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at \(E\).
   - \(\angle ABC = \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
   - We need to find \(\angle 3\), which is supplementary to \(\angle 2\).

2. **Using Geometric Properties:**
   - In rectangle \(ABCD\), \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).
   - \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 90^\circ\).

3. **Calculation:**
   - Given \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\), calculate \(\angle 3\):
     \[
     \angle 3 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The measure of \(\angle 3\) is \(50^\circ\), which corresponds to option C.
