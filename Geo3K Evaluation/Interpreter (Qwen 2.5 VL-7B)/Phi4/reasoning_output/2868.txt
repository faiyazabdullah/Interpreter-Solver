1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a right angle at \( B \) (\( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \)).
   - The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal in length.
   - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( x \), which is likely the length of \( AB \) or \( BC \) since they are equal and form the right angle at \( B \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB = BC \), it is an isosceles right triangle.
   - In an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse \( AC \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2}
     \]
   - Since \( AB = BC = x \), the equation becomes:
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate \( x \) Using the Hypotenuse:**
   - We need to find \( x \) such that \( AC \) is a specific value. Since no specific value for \( AC \) is given, we assume it must be calculated from the options.
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{AC}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

5. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - We need to determine which choice for \( x \) makes \( AC \) a reasonable hypotenuse length.
   - Calculate \( AC \) for each \( x \) value from the options:
     - **A. \( x = 9 \):**
       \[
       AC = 9\sqrt{2} \approx 9 \times 1.414 \approx 12.726
       \]
     - **B. \( x = 9.6 \):**
       \[
       AC = 9.6\sqrt{2} \approx 9.6 \times 1.414 \approx 13.5744
       \]
     - **C. \( x = 12 \):**
       \[
       AC = 12\sqrt{2} \approx 12 \times 1.414 \approx 16.968
       \]
     - **D. \( x = 14.4 \):**
       \[
       AC = 14.4\sqrt{2} \approx 14.4 \times 1.414 \approx 20.3616
       \]

6. **Compare Calculated Results:**
   - We need to find the \( x \) that makes \( AC \) a reasonable hypotenuse length for a typical right triangle.
   - \( AC \approx 12.726 \) when \( x = 9 \) is a reasonable length for a hypotenuse given typical triangle dimensions.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Based on the calculations, \( x = 9 \) gives a hypotenuse length closest to a typical integer or simple decimal value.

8. **Final Decision:**
   - The closest and most reasonable choice for \( x \) is 9.

</think>

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and calculations, the value of \( x \) that fits the geometric properties of the triangle is 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:
