**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and the question.**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with vertices \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
- The sides of the triangle are \( \overline{RS} \), \( \overline{ST} \), and \( \overline{RT} \).
- We are interested in finding \( m \angle RST \).
- The problem states "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T))", but this is ambiguous. It suggests that the measure of \( \angle RST \) is directly given or should be deduced from additional information.

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings.**

- No specific numerical values or additional geometric properties (like side lengths, other angle measures, or special triangle types) are provided.
- The question asks for \( m \angle RST \), which implies it is an interior angle of \( \triangle RST \).

**Step 3: Brainstorm new ideas and apply relevant geometric theorems.**

- Without additional information, we cannot directly calculate \( m \angle RST \) using the given data.
- Consider if there are any standard angles or properties that might apply (e.g., isosceles triangles, equilateral triangles, etc.).
- Since no specific properties are given, we might assume a common scenario where \( \angle RST \) could be a standard angle.

**Step 4: Verify the accuracy of current steps and refine any errors.**

- Reassess the problem statement: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T))" might imply a standard angle measure.
- Consider common angle measures in problems: 55°, 70°, 75°, and 80° are provided as choices.

**Step 5: Revisit previous steps and explore possible assumptions.**

- Since no specific properties are given, assume \( \angle RST \) could be a common angle measure in typical geometric problems.
- Consider the possibility that the problem might be testing recognition of standard angle measures.

**Step 6: Compare calculated result with given answer choices.**

- Without additional information, assume a common scenario where \( \angle RST \) is one of the provided choices.
- Among the choices, 70° and 75° are often seen in problems involving angles in triangles.

**Step 7: Select the closest answer.**

- Given the lack of specific information, choose the angle that is commonly used in geometric problems.
- 75° is a common angle in problems involving isosceles or special triangles.

<Solution>

Given the lack of specific information about the triangle \( \triangle RST \), we must rely on the assumption that the problem is testing recognition of standard angle measures. Among the choices provided, 75° is a common angle measure that appears in many geometric problems, especially those involving isosceles triangles or special angle configurations.

Thus, based on the given answer choices and typical geometric scenarios, the most reasonable assumption is that \( m \angle RST = 75^\circ \).
