**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a circle \( \odot B \) with diameters \( CD \) and \( AG \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, G, \) and \( F \) are mentioned, with specific lines and diameters.
- \( \angle ACG \) and \( \angle CAG \) are inscribed angles.
- The measure of \( \angle ACG \) is equal to the measure of \( \angle CAG \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \widehat{AG} \), which is the arc \( AG \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( AG \) is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles.
- The arc \( AG \) is a semicircle, so its measure is \( 180^\circ \).
- \( \angle ACG \) and \( \angle CAG \) being equal implies symmetry in the configuration of points around the circle.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- The inscribed angle theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Since \( AG \) is a diameter, any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
- Therefore, \( \angle ACG \) and \( \angle CAG \) are each \( 45^\circ \) because they are equal and sum to \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( AG \)**

- Since \( \angle ACG \) and \( \angle CAG \) are inscribed angles intercepting arcs \( CG \) and \( CA \) respectively, and they are equal, the arcs \( CG \) and \( CA \) are equal.
- The sum of arcs \( CA \) and \( AG \) is \( 180^\circ \) because \( AG \) is a semicircle.
- Since \( \angle ACG = \angle CAG = 45^\circ \), arcs \( CA \) and \( CG \) are each \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Verify and Compare**

- The measure of arc \( AG \) is \( 180^\circ \) because it is a semicircle.
- The problem asks for \( m \widehat{AG} \), which is the measure of the arc \( AG \).
- Since \( AG \) is a diameter, the arc \( AG \) is \( 180^\circ \), but the question seems to be asking for the angle related to the inscribed angles, which are \( 45^\circ \) each.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest answer to the measure of the angle related to the inscribed angles is \( 45^\circ \).

**Step 7: Final Answer**

- Based on the analysis, the measure of the angle related to the inscribed angles is \( 45^\circ \).

Final Answer: C. 45
