**Analysis of the Geometric Constraints:**
1. **Understanding the Shape:** We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The properties of a rectangle include:
   - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - All angles are right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Given Information:**
   - The problem states that angles \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are right angles.
   - The lengths \(AB\) and \(AD\) are equal to some unspecified lengths, but \(AB = AD\) is given.
   - Lines \(AB\) and \(AD\) are not parallel, which is consistent with a rectangle since adjacent sides are perpendicular.
   - The area of the rectangle is required.

3. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of rectangle \(ABCD\).

4. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Here, \(AB\) and \(AD\) are the lengths of two adjacent sides.

5. **Exploring the Given Equalities:**
   - Since \(AB = AD\), the rectangle is actually a square. This is because all sides of a square are equal, and the given equality implies this condition.

6. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Let the common length of \(AB\) and \(AD\) be \(s\).
   - The area of the square is:
     \[
     A = s \times s = s^2
     \]

7. **Determining the Side Length:**
   - The problem does not provide the specific length of \(s\), but we can infer from the answer choices that the area must be a perfect square.
   - Checking the answer choices:
     - \(22\) is not a perfect square.
     - \(44\) is not a perfect square.
     - \(60\) is not a perfect square.
     - \(120\) is not a perfect square.
   - However, we need to find the closest perfect square to these values.

8. **Finding the Closest Perfect Square:**
   - The perfect squares near the given options are:
     - \(16\) (for \(s = 4\))
     - \(25\) (for \(s = 5\))
     - \(36\) (for \(s = 6\))
     - \(49\) (for \(s = 7\))
     - \(64\) (for \(s = 8\))
     - \(81\) (for \(s = 9\))
     - \(100\) (for \(s = 10\))
   - The closest perfect square to the given options is \(64\), which corresponds to \(s = 8\).

9. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - Since \(s^2 = 64\) is closest to the given options, and \(64\) is closest to \(60\), we choose \(60\) as the closest area.

10. **Conclusion:**
    - Based on the analysis, the closest area to a perfect square is \(60\), corresponding to side length \(s = 8\).

</think>

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and the analysis, the area of the rectangle (which is a square) is closest to \(60\) when considering the perfect square \(64\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
