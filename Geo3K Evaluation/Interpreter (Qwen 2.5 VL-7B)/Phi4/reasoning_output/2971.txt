### Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints
The problem defines a parallelogram \(XYZW\) with specific properties:
- \(XY \parallel ZW\) and \(YZ \parallel WX\) as per the definition of a parallelogram.
- \(XY = ZW\), \(YZ = WX\), and all sides are equal: \(XY = YZ = ZW = WX\).

### Step 2: Summarize the Properties of the Parallelogram
Given that all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, \(XYZW\) is not just any parallelogram but a **rhombus**. In a rhombus, all sides have equal length.

### Step 3: Identify What Needs to be Found
The problem asks to "use the parallelogram to find \(b\)." However, \(b\) is not defined in the problem. We need to infer the role of \(b\) based on the properties of a rhombus or the relationships between its diagonals.

### Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties
In a rhombus:
- All sides are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- The diagonals divide the rhombus into four right-angled triangles.

If we assume \(b\) could be related to the diagonals, we recall:
- Let the diagonals be \(d_1\) and \(d_2\).
- The area of the rhombus can be expressed as \(\frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\).

### Step 5: Consider Possible Values for \(b\)
Since \(b\) is not explicitly defined, let's assume it could be related to the diagonals or another property of the rhombus. One common relationship in a rhombus is between the side length \(s\) and the diagonals:
\[ s^2 = \left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

### Step 6: Explore the Relationship
Assume \(s = b\) (since all sides are equal in a rhombus, and \(b\) might represent the side length):
- If \(b\) is the side length, then \(b^2 = \left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2\).

### Step 7: Verify with Answer Choices
Given the answer choices, we need to find a plausible value for \(b\) that fits the properties of a rhombus:
- \(b\) could be a simple integer value that fits the equation above.

### Step 8: Calculate and Compare
Assume \(b = 7\), \(11\), \(21\), or \(33\) and check if they fit the properties of a rhombus:
- Without specific values for \(d_1\) and \(d_2\), we rely on the simplicity and typical properties of rhombuses.
- The simplest integer side length that fits typical geometric problems is often the smallest value.

### Step 9: Select the Closest Value
Given the choices, \(b = 7\) is a reasonable assumption for the side length of a rhombus, as it is a simple integer and fits typical geometric problem constraints.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the properties of a rhombus and the lack of specific diagonal information, we assume \(b\) represents the side length of the rhombus. The simplest integer side length that fits typical geometric problems is often the smallest value. Therefore, the most reasonable choice is \(b = 7\).
