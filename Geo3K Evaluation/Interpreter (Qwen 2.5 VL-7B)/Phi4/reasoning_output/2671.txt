**Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints:**

1. **Identifying the Triangles:**
   - We have two triangles: Triangle(X, Y, Z) and Triangle(J, K, L).
   - Both triangles are isosceles, meaning two sides of each triangle are equal in length.
   - The given constraint states that the lengths of all sides of Triangle(X, Y, Z) are equal, which implies that Triangle(X, Y, Z) is equilateral.
   - Similarly, the sides of Triangle(J, K, L) are all equal, making it an equilateral triangle as well.
   - The angles in both triangles are equal, implying each angle measures 60 degrees since they are equilateral.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of Line(J, K), denoted as KL.

3. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - For equilateral triangles, all sides are equal, and all interior angles are 60 degrees.
   - The constraint "Equals(LengthOf(Line(X, Y), LengthOf(Line(Y, Z), LengthOf(Line(Z, X))) implies that all sides of Triangle(X, Y, Z) are equal.
   - The same applies to Triangle(J, K, L) with "Equals(LengthOf(Line(J, K), LengthOf(Line(K, L), LengthOf(Line(L, J))".

4. **Exploration of Possible Solutions:**
   - Since both triangles are equilateral, the length of any side of Triangle(J, K, L) must be the same as the length of any side of Triangle(X, Y, Z).
   - The problem does not provide specific numeric values for the sides of Triangle(X, Y, Z), but the equality of sides and angles suggests a symmetry that can be used to find KL.

5. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - Since the triangles are equilateral and the problem implies symmetry between the triangles, the side lengths must be consistent with the given answer choices.
   - We need to determine a reasonable assumption for the side length of Triangle(X, Y, Z) that matches the given choices for KL.

6. **Assumption and Calculation:**
   - Assume the side length of Triangle(X, Y, Z) is a common integer that fits the choices given for KL.
   - The choices are 4, 5, 12, and 15. Since both triangles are equilateral and have equal sides, KL must be one of these values.
   - Without loss of generality, assume the side length of Triangle(X, Y, Z) is 12 (a reasonable assumption given the choices).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since both triangles are equilateral and have equal side lengths, and given the choices, the most reasonable assumption is that KL = 12.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given that both triangles are equilateral and have equal side lengths, and considering the answer choices provided, the side length of Triangle(J, K, L) must match one of the given options. The most reasonable assumption, considering the symmetry and equality of the triangles, is that KL = 12.
