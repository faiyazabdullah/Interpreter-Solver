### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints
- We have an equilateral triangle \( \triangle EFG \). In an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal to \( 60^\circ \).
- Point \( H \) is on line \( EF \) such that line \( EH \) bisects \(\angle E\). This means \(\angle HEF = \angle HEG\).

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \), which is \(\angle HEF\).

### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties
- Since \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, \(\angle E = 60^\circ\).
- \( EH \) bisects \(\angle E\), so \(\angle HEF = \angle HEG = \frac{1}{2} \times 60^\circ = 30^\circ\).

### Step 4: Verify Calculations
- The calculation of \(\angle HEF\) as \(30^\circ\) is consistent with the property of angle bisectors in an equilateral triangle.

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated measure of \(\angle HEF\) is \(30^\circ\).
- Among the answer choices, \(30^\circ\) corresponds to option B.

### Step 6: Reassess and Reflect
- Reassessing the steps confirms that the bisector property was correctly applied, and the measure of \(\angle HEF\) was accurately calculated.

### Step 7: Finalize the Solution
- The solution is consistent with the geometric properties and the given constraints.

**Solution:**

1. In an equilateral triangle \( \triangle EFG \), each angle measures \( 60^\circ \).
2. Since \( EH \) bisects \(\angle E\), it divides \( \angle E \) into two equal angles.
3. Therefore, \(\angle HEF = \angle HEG = \frac{1}{2} \times 60^\circ = 30^\circ\).
4. Thus, the measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(30^\circ\).

Final Answer: B
