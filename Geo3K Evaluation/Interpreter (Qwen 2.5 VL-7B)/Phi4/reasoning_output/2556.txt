**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have a circle \( C \).
- Points \( A \), \( E \), and \( B \) are on the circle.
- Lines \( AE \), \( BE \), and \( AB \) are radii of the circle.
- \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( \angle AEB \) is a central angle.
- Arcs \( AB \), \( BA \), \( EA \), \( EB \), \( BE \), and \( AE \) are defined.
- The measure of \( \angle AEB \) is \( x \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( AE \), \( BE \), and \( AB \) are radii, \( E \) is the center of the circle.
- \( \angle AEB \) being a central angle means it subtends arc \( AB \).
- The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**

- We need to find the measure \( x \) of \( \angle AEB \).
- Since \( E \) is the center, \( \angle AEB \) is a central angle.
- The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps**

- Confirm that \( \angle AEB \) is indeed a central angle.
- Confirm that the measure of \( \angle AEB \) equals the measure of arc \( AB \).

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**

- Ensure no misinterpretation of the geometric properties.
- Reaffirm that \( E \) is the center, making \( \angle AEB \) a central angle.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**

- Reassess the understanding that \( \angle AEB \) subtends arc \( AB \).
- Confirm that the measure of a central angle equals the arc it subtends.

**Step 7: Explore Additional Considerations**

- Consider the properties of a circle and central angles.
- Recognize that the total degrees in a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

**Step 8: Calculate and Compare**

- Since \( \angle AEB \) is a central angle, \( x = \text{measure of arc } AB \).
- Without specific numerical values, assume a typical scenario where \( \angle AEB \) could be a common central angle.
- Common central angles in problems like this are \( 60^\circ \), \( 90^\circ \), \( 120^\circ \), etc.
- Given the answer choices, \( x \) could be \( 4^\circ \), \( 6^\circ \), \( 8^\circ \), or \( 16^\circ \).
- If \( \angle AEB \) subtends a semicircle, \( x = 180^\circ \), but this is not an option.
- Consider a scenario where \( \angle AEB \) is \( 90^\circ \), which is a common central angle.
- \( 90^\circ \) is not directly an option, but if \( \angle AEB \) subtends a quarter circle, it could be \( 90^\circ \).
- If \( \angle AEB \) subtends an eighth of a circle, \( x = 45^\circ \), which is not an option.
- If \( \angle AEB \) subtends a sixteenth of a circle, \( x = 22.5^\circ \), which is not an option.
- Consider \( \angle AEB \) subtending a twelfth of a circle, \( x = 30^\circ \), not an option.
- Consider \( \angle AEB \) subtending a thirty-second of a circle, \( x = 11.25^\circ \), not an option.
- Consider \( \angle AEB \) subtending a sixty-fourth of a circle, \( x = 5.625^\circ \), close to \( 6^\circ \).

**Step 9: Final Decision**

- The closest match to a typical central angle measure given the options is \( 6^\circ \).

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and typical scenarios for central angles, the measure \( x \) of \( \angle AEB \) is closest to \( 6^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
