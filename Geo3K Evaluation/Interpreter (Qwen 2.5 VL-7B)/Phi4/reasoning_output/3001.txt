1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \( C \) with center at point \( C \).
   - Points \( J \) and \( K \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - Line \( JK \) is a chord of the circle.
   - \( \angle CJK \) is a central angle.
   - We need to find the length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \).

2. **Identifying the Known Values:**
   - The length of line segment \( JK \) (the chord) is given.
   - The central angle \( \angle CJK \) is provided.
   - We need to find the arc length \( \widehat{JK} \).

3. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - The arc length \( \widehat{JK} \) is related to the central angle \( \angle CJK \) and the radius \( r \) of the circle.
   - The formula for arc length \( L \) is \( L = r \theta \), where \( \theta \) is in radians.

4. **Finding the Radius:**
   - Use the chord length formula: \( JK = 2r \sin(\theta/2) \).
   - Rearrange to find \( r \): \( r = \frac{JK}{2 \sin(\theta/2)} \).

5. **Calculating the Arc Length:**
   - Once \( r \) is found, use \( L = r \theta \) to find the arc length.

6. **Assumptions and Calculations:**
   - Assume \( JK = 1 \) (since the exact length isn't given, this is a placeholder for calculation).
   - Assume \( \theta = 1 \) radian (as a placeholder for calculation).

7. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - Calculate \( r \) using \( r = \frac{1}{2 \sin(0.5)} \).
   - Calculate \( L = r \times 1 \).

8. **Refining the Calculation:**
   - Use the correct values for \( JK \) and \( \theta \) once they are known.
   - Recalculate \( r \) and \( L \).

9. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - Compare the calculated arc length with the provided choices.
   - Select the closest value.

10. **Final Calculation:**
    - Assume \( JK = 1 \) and \( \theta = 1 \) radian for simplicity.
    - Calculate \( r = \frac{1}{2 \sin(0.5)} \approx 0.6366 \).
    - Calculate \( L = 0.6366 \times 1 \approx 0.6366 \).

11. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
    - Compare \( 0.6366 \) with the given choices: 0.52, 0.79, 1.05, 1.57.
    - The closest value is 0.79.

</think>

<Solution>

Given the assumptions and calculations, the closest arc length to the calculated value of approximately 0.6366 is 0.79.
