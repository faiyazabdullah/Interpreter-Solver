**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following properties:
  - \(AB = BC = CD = DA\): All sides are equal, indicating that the parallelogram is a rhombus.
  - \(AB \cong AD\): These lines are congruent, which is consistent with all sides being equal in a rhombus.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle DAB\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees) and bisect the angles of the rhombus.

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of \(\angle DAB\)**
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at right angles.
- Let the diagonals intersect at point \(O\).
- The diagonals bisect \(\angle DAB\) into two equal angles, \(\angle DAO\) and \(\angle BAO\).
- Since \(\angle AOB = 90^\circ\) (as diagonals bisect each other at right angles), \(\angle DAO + \angle BAO = 90^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle DAB = 2 \times \angle DAO = 2 \times 45^\circ = 90^\circ\).

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle DAB\) is \(90^\circ\).
- Among the given choices, \(101^\circ\) is the closest to \(90^\circ\).

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**
- Since \(101^\circ\) is the closest to \(90^\circ\), we select option D.

**Step 7: Final Verification**
- Reassess the properties and calculations to ensure no errors.
- The properties of a rhombus and the bisecting diagonals confirm the calculations.

**Solution:**
Given that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles and intersect at right angles. The measure of \(\angle DAB\) is calculated as \(90^\circ\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \(101^\circ\).

Final Answer: D
