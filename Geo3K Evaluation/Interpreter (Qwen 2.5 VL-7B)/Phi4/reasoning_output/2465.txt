<think>
**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given that lines \( l \), \( m \), and \( n \) are perpendicular bisectors of triangle \( \triangle PQR \) and they meet at point \( T \). This means \( T \) is the circumcenter of the triangle, and the distances from \( T \) to each vertex (\( P, Q, R \)) are equal. Therefore, \( TQ = TP = TR \).

**Step 2: Extract the Equations**

We have the following equations based on the problem statement:
- \( TQ = 2x \)
- \( TP = 3y - 1 \)
- \( TR = 8 \)

Since \( TQ = TP = TR \), we can set up the following equations:
1. \( 2x = 8 \)
2. \( 3y - 1 = 8 \)

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

From equation 1:
\[ 2x = 8 \]
\[ x = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( y \)**

From equation 2:
\[ 3y - 1 = 8 \]
\[ 3y = 8 + 1 \]
\[ 3y = 9 \]
\[ y = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

**Step 5: Determine \( z \)**

The problem asks to find \( z \), but it does not explicitly define \( z \). However, given the context and the structure of the problem, \( z \) is likely related to either \( x \) or \( y \). Since \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 3 \), and the problem does not provide a direct equation for \( z \), we infer \( z \) is likely equal to \( x \) or \( y \).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The answer choices are:
- A. 3
- B. 4
- C. 5
- D. 6

Since \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 3 \), the closest match for \( z \) is \( x = 4 \).

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**

Given the constraints and the calculations, the most logical choice for \( z \) is 4, which corresponds to answer choice B.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, we determined that \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 3 \). Since \( z \) is inferred to be \( x \), the value of \( z \) is 4. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:

Final Answer: B
