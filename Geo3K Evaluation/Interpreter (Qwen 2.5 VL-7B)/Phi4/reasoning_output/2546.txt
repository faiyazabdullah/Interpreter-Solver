**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- We have a circle with center \( X \).
- Points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( W \) are given, with \( Y \) and \( W \) likely lying on the circumference of the circle.
- An arc \( XY \) and a sector \( XYW \) are defined.
- The radius of the circle is given as \( \text{RadiusOf}(Circle(X)) \).
- The central angle of the sector \( XYW \) is \( \text{CentralAngle}(Sector(X,Y,W)) \).
- We need to find the area of the sector \( XYW \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- The area of the sector \( XYW \) is required.
- We need to use the formula for the area of a sector: 
  \[
  \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times r^2
  \]
  where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees, and \( r \) is the radius.

**Step 3: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- The central angle \( \theta \) is given as \( 52^\circ \).
- The radius \( r \) is not directly given, but we have a multiplication expression: 
  \[
  \text{Mul(RadiusOf(Circle(X))} \times \text{Mul(Sin(Div(Rad(52))}
  \]
- This suggests a calculation involving the sine of \( 52^\circ \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Radius**

- The expression \( \text{Mul(Sin(Div(Rad(52))} \) suggests calculating \( \sin(52^\circ) \).
- Convert \( 52^\circ \) to radians: 
  \[
  \text{Rad}(52^\circ) = \frac{52 \times \pi}{180}
  \]
- Calculate \( \sin(52^\circ) \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Sector**

- Use the formula for the area of a sector:
  \[
  \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times r^2
  \]
- Substitute \( r \) from the multiplication expression:
  \[
  r = \text{RadiusOf(Circle(X))} \times \sin(52^\circ)
  \]
- Substitute \( r \) into the area formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times (\text{RadiusOf(Circle(X))} \times \sin(52^\circ))^2
  \]

**Step 6: Simplify and Calculate**

- Assume \( \text{RadiusOf(Circle(X))} = 1 \) for simplicity, as the exact value is not given.
- Calculate:
  \[
  \sin(52^\circ) \approx 0.7880
  \]
- Calculate the area:
  \[
  \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times (0.7880)^2
  \]
  \[
  \approx \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times 0.6205
  \]
  \[
  \approx 0.1411 \times \pi \times 0.6205
  \]
  \[
  \approx 0.1411 \times 1.947
  \]
  \[
  \approx 0.2747
  \]
- Multiply by the radius squared term:
  \[
  \text{Area} \approx 0.2747 \times 1 = 0.2747
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated area \( 0.2747 \) is closest to \( 0.9 \) when considering rounding and the given options.

</think>

**Solution**

Based on the calculations and the given answer choices, the closest value to the calculated area of the sector is \( 0.9 \).
