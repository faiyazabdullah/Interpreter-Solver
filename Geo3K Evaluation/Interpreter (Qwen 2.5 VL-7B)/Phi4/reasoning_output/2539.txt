### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze Given Information**
- We are given a circle \(\odot M\) with points F, H, P, J, G, K, L, I.
- The chord FL has a length of 24, and the chord HJ has a length of 48.
- We are also given that the measure of the inscribed angle \(\angle MHP\) is 65 degrees.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{P}J\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Given \(\angle MHP\) is 65 degrees, it is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \(\widehat{HP}\).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \(\widehat{HP}\) is \(2 \times 65 = 130\) degrees.

**Step 4: Relate Arcs and Angles**
- We are given that \(\angle MPJ\) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \(\widehat{PJ}\).
- The measure of \(\angle MPJ\) is equal to the measure of \(\angle MHP\), which is 65 degrees.
- Therefore, the measure of arc \(\widehat{PJ}\) is \(2 \times 65 = 130\) degrees.

**Step 5: Verify and Cross-Check**
- We have determined that the measure of arc \(\widehat{PJ}\) is 130 degrees.
- Check if this matches any of the given answer choices.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of arc \(\widehat{PJ}\) is 130 degrees.
- Among the answer choices, 130 degrees corresponds to option D.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**
- Since the calculated measure matches one of the answer choices, select option D.

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis and application of geometric properties, we found that the measure of arc \(\widehat{P}J\) is 130 degrees. This matches option D.
