**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**

- Points: U, V, T, S, J, Y, Z, I.
- Lines: U-V, V-S, T-U, S-T.
- Quadrilateral: U-V-T-S.
- Parallel lines: U-T is parallel to some line (not explicitly named, but possibly V-S since U-T is mentioned to be parallel).
- Length constraints: Length(U-V) = Length(T-U).
- Additional distances: U-J = 9, V-J = 3, Z-T = 18.
- Objective: Find the length of S-V.

**Step 2: Understanding the Geometric Properties**

- Since Length(U-V) = Length(T-U), U-V-T forms an isosceles triangle with UV = TU.
- Given that U-T is parallel to another line, and considering the quadrilateral U-V-T-S, the parallel lines suggest that S-V could be equal to U-V or T-U due to the properties of parallelograms or trapezoids.

**Step 3: Exploring the Configuration**

- The quadrilateral U-V-T-S could be a parallelogram if S-V is parallel and equal to U-T. However, we don't have explicit information about S-V being parallel to U-T.
- Alternatively, if S-V is parallel to U-V, then S-V could equal U-V or T-U due to the properties of parallel lines in a trapezoid.

**Step 4: Using Given Distances**

- The distances U-J = 9 and V-J = 3 suggest that J is on the line U-V, and the segment UJ is three times VJ.
- This implies that J divides U-V in the ratio 3:1.
- Since Length(U-V) = Length(T-U), and U-J = 9, V-J = 3, then U-V = U-J + V-J = 9 + 3 = 12.

**Step 5: Determining S-V**

- If S-V is parallel and equal to U-V (or T-U), then S-V = 12.
- However, if S-V is not parallel to U-V, we need to consider other configurations.
- Given the choices, S-V could be a fraction of U-V if it forms a different geometric figure like a trapezoid.

**Step 6: Verification and Selection**

- Since U-V = 12 and S-V could be a fraction of this length, consider the choices:
  - A. 3
  - B. 6
  - C. 9
  - D. 12
- If S-V is half of U-V (a common scenario in trapezoids or parallelograms), then S-V = 6.

**Step 7: Final Decision**

- Based on the analysis, the most reasonable assumption is that S-V is half of U-V, given the lack of other explicit constraints.
- Therefore, S-V = 6.

**Solution**

Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and the properties of the quadrilateral U-V-T-S, along with the given distances and the properties of parallel lines, the length of S-V is determined to be 6. This conclusion is reached by considering the possibility of S-V being half of U-V, which is a common scenario in geometric configurations involving parallel lines and equal lengths.
