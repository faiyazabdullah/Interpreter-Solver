**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have two angles mentioned: \( m \angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m \angle 12 = 55^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 13 \).

**Step 2: Consider Geometric Relationships**
- Without a figure, we must assume typical geometric relationships such as those involving parallel lines and transversals, or properties of triangles, etc.
- Given the angles \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \), it's possible they are part of a larger geometric figure like a transversal intersecting parallel lines.

**Step 3: Summarize Potential Relationships**
- If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are part of a transversal with parallel lines, we can consider alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, or consecutive interior angles.
- If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 13 \) are on the same line or part of a linear pair, their measures should add up to \( 180^\circ \).

**Step 4: Explore Possible Configurations**
- Assume \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 13 \) are on the same line, making them supplementary. Thus, \( m \angle 3 + m \angle 13 = 180^\circ \).
- Calculate \( m \angle 13 \) using the supplementary angle relationship:
  \[
  m \angle 13 = 180^\circ - m \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Reassess**
- Check if \( \angle 12 \) has any direct relationship with \( \angle 13 \) that could affect the calculation.
- If \( \angle 12 \) is part of a triangle with \( \angle 13 \), consider the triangle sum property, but no direct relationship is given.
- Reassess the assumption that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 13 \) are supplementary, which is a common scenario in geometric problems.

**Step 6: Reflect and Confirm**
- The calculation of \( m \angle 13 = 70^\circ \) fits the supplementary angle scenario.
- Compare this result with the answer choices: A. 55, B. 65, C. 70, D. 110.
- The calculated \( 70^\circ \) matches choice C.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 13 \) is \( 70^\circ \).

**Solution:**

Given the assumption that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 13 \) are supplementary, we calculated:
\[ m \angle 13 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \]

This matches choice C from the provided options. Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 13 \) is 70 degrees.

Final Answer: C
