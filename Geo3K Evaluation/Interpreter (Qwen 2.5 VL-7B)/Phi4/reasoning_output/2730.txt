<think>
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two triangles, \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle EFG \).
   - These triangles are similar, which means their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( GF \).

3. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.
   - Let's denote the sides of \( \triangle RST \) as \( RS, ST, \) and \( TR \).
   - Corresponding sides in \( \triangle EFG \) are \( EF, FG, \) and \( GE \).

4. **Set Up Proportions:**
   - From similarity, we have:
     \[
     \frac{RS}{EF} = \frac{ST}{FG} = \frac{TR}{GE}
     \]
   - We need to find \( FG \).

5. **Consider Possible Given Values:**
   - Since no specific side lengths are provided, we assume the problem provides these implicitly or through the answer choices.

6. **Use Answer Choices to Backtrack:**
   - Assume a common ratio \( k \) such that:
     \[
     FG = k \cdot ST
     \]
   - We need to find \( k \) using the answer choices.

7. **Check Each Answer Choice:**
   - Assume \( k \) such that \( FG \) matches one of the answer choices.
   - Without specific side lengths, assume \( ST = 1 \) for simplicity, then \( FG = k \).

8. **Calculate and Compare:**
   - Check each answer choice:
     - \( A. 7.5 \)
     - \( B. 11.25 \)
     - \( C. 20.7 \)
     - \( D. 40.7 \)
   - Assume \( k = 7.5, 11.25, 20.7, \) or \( 40.7 \) and check for consistency with typical triangle side ratios.

9. **Choose the Most Reasonable Answer:**
   - Without specific side lengths, the choice that typically fits a reasonable scaling factor for similar triangles is \( 11.25 \), assuming \( ST \) was a reasonable base length like 1.

10. **Reassess and Confirm:**
    - Given the lack of specific side lengths, \( 11.25 \) is a plausible choice for a scaling factor in similar triangles.
    - This choice is consistent with typical geometric scaling.

</think>

<Solution>
Given the similarity of triangles \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle EFG \), and the need to find \( GF \), we assume a proportional relationship between the sides. Without specific side lengths, we use the answer choices to determine a plausible scaling factor. The choice \( 11.25 \) is a reasonable scaling factor for similar triangles, assuming typical side lengths. Therefore, the length of \( GF \) is closest to:
