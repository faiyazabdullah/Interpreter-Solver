**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given that Triangle(ABC) is similar to Triangle(DEF) and that the lengths of Line(BC) and Line(DF) are equal. From the property of similar triangles, we know that corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{CA}{FD}
\]

Additionally, we have the constraint:

\[
BC = DF
\]

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the length of AB.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional. Given \( BC = DF \), this implies:

\[
\frac{BC}{DF} = 1
\]

Thus, the ratio of corresponding sides \( \frac{BC}{EF} = 1 \).

**Step 4: Use the Proportionality of Similar Triangles**

Since \( BC = DF \), it follows that:

\[
\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{DF} = 1
\]

This implies that:

\[
AB = DE
\]

**Step 5: Consider Additional Information or Constraints**

We don't have explicit values for DE, EF, or FD. However, since \( BC = DF \) and the triangles are similar, the simplest case is when the triangles are congruent, meaning all corresponding sides are equal. This would imply:

\[
AB = DE = EF = FD = BC = DF
\]

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Results with Given Answer Choices**

Since \( AB = DE \) and all corresponding sides are equal due to the similarity and equality of \( BC \) and \( DF \), we assume a scenario where all sides are equal. Without loss of generality, let's assume a unit length for simplicity, say \( BC = DF = x \).

Given the answer choices, we need to find the closest match for \( AB \). Since all sides are equal in this simplest congruent scenario, \( AB \) should also equal \( x \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**

Given the answer choices:
- A. 5.5
- B. 7
- C. 8
- D. 10

Assuming \( BC = DF = x \) and \( AB = x \), we need to select the closest value for \( x \) from the choices. Since no specific numerical value for \( x \) is given, we assume a reasonable average or typical length that fits the context of typical geometric problems.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**

Given the lack of specific numerical constraints and assuming typical geometric problem settings, the most reasonable assumption for a side length in such problems is often a round number. Among the choices, 7 is a reasonable assumption for a typical side length in such problems.

Final Answer: B

</think>

Solution:  
Given the similarity and equality constraints, and assuming typical geometric settings, the most reasonable assumption for the side length \( AB \) is 7. Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Final Answer: B
