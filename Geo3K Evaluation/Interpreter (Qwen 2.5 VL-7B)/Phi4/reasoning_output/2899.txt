**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have a circle \( W \) with points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
- Lines \( AB, CD, CW, DW, DE, WF \) are defined.
- Several right angles are given:
  - \( \angle CWF \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle CDF \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle WFD \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle WFE \) is a right angle.
- Lines \( CD, AB, \) and \( WF \) are perpendicular.
- \( C \) is the midpoint of \( WF \).
- \( AB \) is a diameter of the circle.
- \( ED = 30 \).

**Step 2: Summarize the relevant findings**

- Since \( C \) is the midpoint of \( WF \) and \( CW = WF \), \( WF \) is divided into two equal segments by \( C \).
- \( AB \) being a diameter implies that the circle's center is the midpoint of \( AB \).
- The right angles involving \( W, F, C, \) and \( D \) suggest a configuration involving perpendicular bisectors and right triangles.

**Step 3: Apply geometric theorems and properties**

- Since \( \angle CDF \) and \( \angle WFD \) are right angles, \( CD \) and \( WF \) are perpendicular.
- \( \angle WFE \) being a right angle and \( ED = 30 \) implies \( DE \) is vertical if \( WF \) is horizontal.
- Since \( C \) is the midpoint of \( WF \), and \( CW = WF \), \( WF \) is twice \( CW \).

**Step 4: Calculate \( DF \)**

- Given \( CW = WF \), let \( CW = x \). Then \( WF = 2x \).
- Since \( \angle WFD \) is a right angle and \( C \) is the midpoint of \( WF \), \( CD \) is vertical.
- \( DE = 30 \) and \( \angle WFE \) is a right angle imply \( DE \) is vertical.
- Since \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( WF \) and \( \angle CDF \) is a right angle, \( D \) lies directly above or below \( F \).
- The distance \( DF \) is the same as \( DE \) because \( \angle WFD \) and \( \angle WFE \) are right angles, forming a rectangle \( WDFE \).

Thus, \( DF = DE = 30 \).

**Step 5: Compare with answer choices**

- The calculated \( DF = 30 \) matches choice B.

**Step 6: Finalize the answer**

- The closest and correct choice is B. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: B
