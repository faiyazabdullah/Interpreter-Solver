1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a parallelogram JKLM with specific properties:
     - Opposite sides are parallel: JK || LM and KL || MJ.
     - Opposite sides are equal: JK = LM and KL = MJ.
     - Given angles: ∠JLK = 70° and ∠JKM = 30°.
     - ∠JLK is supplementary to ∠JKL (since they are consecutive angles in a parallelogram).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of ∠JKL.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, ∠JLK + ∠JKL = 180°.

4. **Perform Calculations:**
   - We know ∠JLK = 70°.
   - Using the supplementary angle property: ∠JLK + ∠JKL = 180°.
   - Substitute the known value: 70° + ∠JKL = 180°.
   - Solve for ∠JKL: ∠JKL = 180° - 70° = 110°.

5. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Verify the calculations: 70° + 110° = 180°, which confirms the supplementary condition.
   - Check if there are any other constraints or properties that might affect the calculation. None are applicable here.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure for ∠JKL is 110°.
   - Compare with the given choices: A. 60, B. 70, C. 80, D. 90.
   - Since 110° is not an option, select the closest value to 110°, which is 90°.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer to 110° is 90°.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis and calculations, the closest answer choice is D. 90.
</think>

<Solution>
Using the properties of a parallelogram, we determined that consecutive angles are supplementary. Given ∠JLK = 70°, we calculated ∠JKL as 110°. Since 110° is not an option, we selected the closest available choice, which is 90°. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
</Solution>
