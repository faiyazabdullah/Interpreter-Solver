**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two right angles: Angle \( \angle AFN \) and Angle \( \angle BFC \).
- The sum of the measures of these angles is given.

**Step 2: Understand the Requirements**

- We need to find \( x \) such that lines \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular.
- This implies that the measure of the angle formed by \( BE \) and \( AD \) should be \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( \angle AFN \) and \( \angle BFC \) are right angles, each measures \( 90^\circ \).
- The sum of these angles is \( 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ \).

**Step 4: Explore Relationships and Constraints**

- If \( BE \) and \( AD \) are to be perpendicular, we need to consider how these lines relate to the given angles.
- The problem does not provide explicit coordinates or equations for lines \( BE \) and \( AD \), so we need to infer their relationship based on the given angles.

**Step 5: Consider Possible Configurations**

- Since the sum of the measures of \( \angle AFN \) and \( \angle BFC \) is \( 180^\circ \), these angles might be on a straight line or adjacent.
- If \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular, they could form a right angle with one of these lines or be part of a configuration involving these angles.

**Step 6: Calculate \( x \) Based on Perpendicularity**

- Assume \( x \) is related to the configuration of these angles.
- Since \( BE \) and \( AD \) must form a \( 90^\circ \) angle, and the sum of \( \angle AFN \) and \( \angle BFC \) is \( 180^\circ \), \( x \) could be a measure that adjusts one of these angles to achieve perpendicularity.

**Step 7: Verify and Refine**

- Check if any of the answer choices for \( x \) can logically fit into a configuration where \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular.
- Consider \( x \) as an adjustment or a measure that complements the existing angles to form a right angle.

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- Given the choices \( 5, 10, 20, 30 \), consider which value could logically fit into the configuration.
- Since the angles sum to \( 180^\circ \), and we need a perpendicular configuration, \( x \) might be a measure that complements one of these angles to \( 90^\circ \).

**Step 9: Select the Closest Answer**

- Without explicit coordinates or further geometric details, \( x \) should be a measure that complements the existing configuration.
- The choice that seems most reasonable, given typical geometric configurations, is \( x = 30 \).

**Step 10: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the analysis and the need for \( BE \) and \( AD \) to be perpendicular, the most logical choice is \( x = 30 \).
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the need for \( BE \) and \( AD \) to be perpendicular, the most reasonable choice for \( x \) is \( 30 \), as it likely complements the existing configuration to achieve the required perpendicularity.
