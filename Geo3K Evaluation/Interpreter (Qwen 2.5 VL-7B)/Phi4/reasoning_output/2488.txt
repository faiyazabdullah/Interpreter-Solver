**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle WWW \) which is a right triangle (Right(Triangle(W, W, W)).
- There is a line \( Line(W, W) \) and its length is equal to another line segment (Equals(LengthOf(Line(W, W))).
- There is a point \( W \) and an angle \( \angle WWW \) which is a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(W, W, W)).
- We need to find the scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- The triangle \( \triangle WWW \) is a right triangle, implying one of its angles is \( 90^\circ \).
- The problem involves scaling, which typically involves a transformation that enlarges or reduces a figure by a scale factor.
- We need to determine how the lengths or dimensions change from \( W \) to \( W' \).

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**
- Consider the properties of right triangles and scaling transformations.
- If the triangle is scaled, the scale factor will apply uniformly to all sides of the triangle.
- The scale factor is the ratio of a side length in the image to the corresponding side length in the pre-image.

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps**
- Ensure the understanding that the scale factor applies to all dimensions of the triangle.
- Recognize that the problem might involve comparing lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles.

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**
- Clarify that the scale factor is a single value that applies to all dimensions of the triangle.
- Ensure that the interpretation of the problem aligns with standard geometric scaling.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**
- Confirm that the right triangle and scaling transformation are correctly understood.
- Reassess the need to find a specific scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \).

**Step 7: Exploration and Calculation**
- Assume \( \triangle WWW \) is scaled to \( \triangle W'W'W' \).
- Let the original side lengths be \( a, b, \) and \( c \) (hypotenuse).
- After scaling, the side lengths become \( ka, kb, \) and \( kc \).
- Given that the lengths are equal, \( k \) must satisfy the condition \( k \times \text{original length} = \text{new length} \).

**Step 8: Determine the Scale Factor**
- Since the problem states \( Equals(LengthOf(Line(W, W)) \), it implies the length remains the same after scaling.
- This suggests that the scale factor \( k \) must be such that the new length equals the original length, implying \( k = 1 \).
- However, since we must choose from the given options, consider the closest possible scale factor.

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The options are \( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{3}{2} \).
- Since \( k = 1 \) is not an option, the closest to 1 is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

**Step 10: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the analysis, the closest scale factor to 1 is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the need to find the scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \), we determined that the scale factor should be 1, as the lengths remain equal. The closest option to 1 is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

Final Answer: C. \(\frac{3}{4}\)
