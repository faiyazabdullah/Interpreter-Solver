**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A, B, C, D\).
- The rectangle has right angles at each vertex: \(\angle ABC, \angle BCD, \angle CDA, \angle DAB\).
- All sides of the rectangle are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
- This implies that the rectangle is actually a square because all sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the area of the square.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(AB = BC = CD = DA\), let the side length of the square be \(s\).
- The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula \(A = s^2\).

**Step 4: Consider Possible Values for \(s\)**
- We need to determine \(s\) to calculate the area.
- Since no specific numerical side length is given, we need to use the answer choices to infer the possible value of \(s\).

**Step 5: Calculate Possible Areas and Compare with Choices**
- Let's calculate the side length \(s\) for each area choice:
  - If \(A = 75\), then \(s^2 = 75\) and \(s = \sqrt{75} \approx 8.7\).
  - If \(A = 112.5\), then \(s^2 = 112.5\) and \(s = \sqrt{112.5} \approx 10.6\).
  - If \(A = 129.9\), then \(s^2 = 129.9\) and \(s = \sqrt{129.9} \approx 11.4\).
  - If \(A = 225\), then \(s^2 = 225\) and \(s = \sqrt{225} = 15\).

**Step 6: Verify the Calculations**
- The side length \(s\) must be a reasonable number that fits the context of a square with integer or simple fractional side lengths.
- \(s = 15\) is a simple integer, making it a likely candidate.

**Step 7: Reassess and Reflect**
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the side length \(s = 15\) is the most straightforward and reasonable choice.
- The area calculated with \(s = 15\) is \(225\), which matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 8: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the calculations and the constraints, the area of the square is \(225\).

**Solution:**

Given that the rectangle is a square with equal side lengths, and considering the calculations for each possible area, the side length \(s = 15\) results in an area of \(225\). This matches one of the provided answer choices.
