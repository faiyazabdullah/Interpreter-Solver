1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have two angles given: \( m \angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m \angle 12 = 55^\circ \).
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem suggests some geometric relationship between angles 1, 3, and 12, likely involving parallel lines and transversals or a polygon with known angle measures.
   - The use of \( \text{Angle}(1) \) and \( \text{Angle}(12) \) hints at possible parallel lines and transversal properties, such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles.

3. **Exploring Possible Geometric Relationships:**
   - If angles 3 and 12 are on parallel lines cut by a transversal, we can use properties of parallel lines:
     - Corresponding angles are equal.
     - Alternate interior angles are equal.
     - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

4. **Considering Angle Relationships:**
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are on the same side of a transversal intersecting two parallel lines, they could be consecutive interior angles. In this case, they would sum to \(180^\circ\):
     \[
     m \angle 3 + m \angle 12 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     110^\circ + 55^\circ = 165^\circ
     \]
     - This does not sum to \(180^\circ\), so they are not consecutive interior angles.

5. **Exploring Alternate Interior Angles:**
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are alternate interior angles, they should be equal, which they are not.

6. **Considering Corresponding Angles:**
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are corresponding angles, they should be equal, which they are not.

7. **Reassessing the Problem:**
   - Since the direct relationships do not apply, consider if \( \angle 1 \) is related to \( \angle 3 \) or \( \angle 12 \) through another geometric property.
   - If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are on a straight line (linear pair), they should sum to \(180^\circ\):
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 3 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 1 + 110^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]

8. **Considering Other Possibilities:**
   - If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are supplementary (perhaps they form a linear pair or are consecutive interior angles with another angle), then:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 12 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 1 + 55^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
     \]

9. **Verification and Conclusion:**
   - The calculation \( m \angle 1 = 125^\circ \) is consistent with the possibility of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 12 \) being supplementary.
   - This matches one of the answer choices, confirming the solution.

Based on the analysis of geometric relationships and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 125^\circ \). This matches answer choice C.
