### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given that quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- In a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles, each measuring \(90^\circ\).
- We are given that \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\). However, the position of \(\angle 2\) is not specified in the problem.
- We need to find \(m \angle 8\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- The task is to find the measure of \(\angle 8\).
- We need to determine the relationship between \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 8\) within the rectangle.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**

- In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).
- Since \(\angle 2\) is given as \(40^\circ\), it must be an angle formed by extending one of the rectangle's sides or by intersecting diagonals or lines within the rectangle.

**Step 4: Consider Possible Configurations**

- If \(\angle 2\) is formed by extending a side of the rectangle, it could be an exterior angle.
- If \(\angle 2\) is formed by intersecting diagonals or lines, it could be an interior angle related to the rectangle's diagonals.

**Step 5: Explore the Relationship Between \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 8\)**

- Assume \(\angle 2\) is an angle formed by a diagonal or line intersecting inside the rectangle.
- In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other and are equal.
- If \(\angle 2\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal, then the angles around the intersection of diagonals must sum to \(360^\circ\).

**Step 6: Calculate \(\angle 8\)**

- If \(\angle 2\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal, and assuming \(\angle 8\) is an adjacent angle formed by the same diagonal or line, then \(\angle 2 + \angle 8 = 90^\circ\) (since diagonals of a rectangle bisect the angles into two equal parts).
- Therefore, \(\angle 8 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ\).

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 8\) is \(50^\circ\).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 40, B. 50, C. 80, D. 100.
- The closest and exact match is option B.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle 8\) is \(50^\circ\).
- Select the closest and exact answer choice.

**Solution Section**

- Given the constraints and the properties of a rectangle, we deduced that \(\angle 8\) is supplementary to \(\angle 2\) when \(\angle 2\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal or line intersecting inside the rectangle.
- Calculating \(m \angle 8 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ\).
- The correct answer choice is B.
