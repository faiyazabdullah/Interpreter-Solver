**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have a regular hexagon \(JKL MNP\) inscribed in a circle \(R\).
- It is stated that the central angles subtended by each side of the hexagon at the center of the circle are equal.
- A regular hexagon has equal sides and equal interior angles. 

**Step 2: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the measure of a central angle of this inscribed regular hexagon.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- A central angle in a circle is the angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle.
- For a polygon inscribed in a circle, the measure of each central angle is given by the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]
  where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon.

**Step 4: Calculation**
- Since \(JKL MNP\) is a regular hexagon, it has \(n = 6\) sides.
- Substituting into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the property of regular polygons inscribed in a circle.

**Step 6: Compare with Given Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of the central angle is \(60^\circ\).
- Comparing this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 30
  - B. 60
  - C. 90
  - D. 120

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**
- The calculated result \(60^\circ\) matches exactly with choice B.

**Step 8: Conclusion**
- The calculations and geometric reasoning confirm that the measure of the central angle is \(60^\circ\).
- Therefore, the correct answer choice is B.

**Solution:**

A regular hexagon inscribed in a circle divides the circle into six equal arcs, each subtending a central angle at the center of the circle. The sum of all central angles in a circle is \(360^\circ\). Therefore, each central angle for a regular hexagon is given by:

\[
\text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
\]

This matches with choice B. Therefore, the measure of a central angle is \(60^\circ\).

Final Answer: B
