<think>
1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - We have a regular hexagon, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
   - A triangle ABC is equilateral, and its sides are equal to the sides of the hexagon.
   - The area of the hexagon is obtained by multiplying the area of triangle ABC by 6.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the total area of the hexagon and round it to the nearest tenth.

3. **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \).
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.

4. **Calculations:**
   - Let the side length of the hexagon (and triangle ABC) be \( s \).
   - Area of triangle ABC: 
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
     \]
   - Total area of the hexagon:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{Hexagon}} = 6 \times \text{Area}_{\triangle ABC} = 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
     \]

5. **Determine the Side Length:**
   - Since the side lengths are equal, we can assume a convenient value for \( s \) to simplify calculations. Assume \( s = 2 \) (a common assumption for simplicity in regular polygons).
   - Calculate the area with \( s = 2 \):
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 4 = \sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Total area of the hexagon:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{Hexagon}} = 6 \times \sqrt{3} \approx 6 \times 1.732 = 10.392
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
   - \( 10.392 \) rounds to \( 10.4 \).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The closest answer choice to \( 10.4 \) is \( 11.7 \).

8. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Verify calculations and assumptions. The side length assumption \( s = 2 \) is reasonable for this context.
   - The calculated area is consistent with the expected properties of a regular hexagon.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the calculations and rounding, the closest answer choice is \( 11.7 \).

</think>

**Solution:**

1. The hexagon is regular, composed of 6 equilateral triangles.
2. Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, we calculated the area of one triangle and then multiplied by 6 to find the hexagon's area.
3. With \( s = 2 \), the area of the hexagon is approximately \( 10.4 \).
4. The closest answer choice to \( 10.4 \) is \( 11.7 \).
