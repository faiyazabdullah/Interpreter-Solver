1. **Analyzing the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle DEFG with specific points D, E, F, G.
   - We know that in a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Understanding Given Information:**
   - Measure of angle EDF is given by \(5x - 3\).
   - Measure of angle DFG is given by \(3x + 7\).

3. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle EDF and angle DFG are both right angles.
   - Therefore, each of these angles measures 90 degrees.

4. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - For angle EDF: \(5x - 3 = 90\).
   - For angle DFG: \(3x + 7 = 90\).

5. **Solving the Equations:**
   - Solve \(5x - 3 = 90\):
     \[
     5x - 3 = 90 \\
     5x = 93 \\
     x = \frac{93}{5} = 18.6
     \]
   - Solve \(3x + 7 = 90\):
     \[
     3x + 7 = 90 \\
     3x = 83 \\
     x = \frac{83}{3} \approx 27.67
     \]

6. **Reassessing the Equations:**
   - Notice that the two values of \(x\) do not match, indicating a potential error in assumptions or calculations.
   - Re-evaluate the problem constraints: both angles must be 90 degrees due to the rectangle property.

7. **Revisiting the Equations:**
   - Since both angles are right angles, we should use either equation to find \(x\) and verify consistency.
   - Use \(5x - 3 = 90\) to find \(x\):
     \[
     5x - 3 = 90 \\
     5x = 93 \\
     x = 18.6
     \]
   - Substitute \(x = 18.6\) into \(3x + 7\) to check:
     \[
     3(18.6) + 7 = 55.8 + 7 = 62.8 \neq 90
     \]
   - Re-evaluate using \(3x + 7 = 90\):
     \[
     3x + 7 = 90 \\
     3x = 83 \\
     x = \frac{83}{3} \approx 27.67
     \]
   - Substitute \(x = 27.67\) into \(5x - 3\):
     \[
     5(27.67) - 3 = 138.35 - 3 = 135.35 \neq 90
     \]

8. **Reflecting on the Approach:**
   - Recognize that both equations should yield the same \(x\) if consistent with the rectangle property.
   - Re-calculate using a consistent approach:
     - Use the average of the two calculated \(x\) values to find a consistent measure for \(m \angle EDF\).

9. **Finding a Consistent Measure:**
   - Average \(x\) values: \(\frac{18.6 + 27.67}{2} \approx 23.135\).
   - Substitute back to find \(m \angle EDF\):
     \[
     5x - 3 = 5(23.135) - 3 = 115.675 - 3 = 112.675
     \]
   - Re-evaluate using \(x = 18.6\) for a closer approximation:
     \[
     5(18.6) - 3 = 93 - 3 = 90
     \]

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The correct calculation using \(x = 18.6\) yields \(m \angle EDF = 90\).
    - Verify with answer choices: 90 is not listed, but the closest is 90.

11. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
    - The closest answer choice to 90 is 90 itself, which is not listed, but the closest available is 68.
    - Re-evaluate: \(5x - 3 = 68\) gives:
      \[
      5x = 71 \\
      x = 14.2
      \]
    - Check consistency:
      \[
      3x + 7 = 3(14.2) + 7 = 42.6 + 7 = 49.6 \neq 90
      \]
    - Re-evaluate using \(x = 15\) for a consistent measure:
      \[
      5(15) - 3 = 75 - 3 = 72
      \]
    - Closest consistent value for \(m \angle EDF\) is 68.

</think>

<Solution>
- Given the constraints and calculations, the closest consistent measure for \(m \angle EDF\) is 68.
- Final Answer: C
