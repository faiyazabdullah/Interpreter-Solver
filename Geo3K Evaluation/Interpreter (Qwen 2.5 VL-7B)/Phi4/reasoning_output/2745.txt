1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - ABCD is a parallelogram.
   - ∠A and ∠D are right angles, so ABCD is a rectangle.
   - AB = CD, AD = BC.
   - AB = CD, AD = BC.
   - AB = AD and BC = CD.
   - Perimeter of ABCD is 22.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of AB.

3. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and AD = BC.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \(2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\).
   - Let AB = CD = x and AD = BC = y.

4. **Set Up the Perimeter Equation:**
   - The perimeter is \(2(x + y) = 22\).
   - Simplifying gives \(x + y = 11\).

5. **Use the Given Length Equality:**
   - AB = AD, so x = y.

6. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Substitute x = y into \(x + y = 11\):
     \[
     x + x = 11 \implies 2x = 11 \implies x = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5
     \]
   - Since x = 5.5, AB = 5.5.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of AB is 5.5, which is not directly listed.
   - The closest answer choice is 7.

8. **Verify and Reflect:**
   - Reassess calculations: \(x + y = 11\) and \(x = y\) correctly lead to \(x = 5.5\).
   - Since 5.5 is not an option, select the closest value, which is 7.

9. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the calculations and the need to select the closest option, the answer is 7.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given that ABCD is a rectangle with sides AB = AD and BC = CD, and the perimeter is 22, we set up the equation:

\[ 2(x + y) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x + y = 11 \]

Given AB = AD, we have \(x = y\). Substituting \(x = y\) into the equation:

\[ x + x = 11 \]

\[ 2x = 11 \]

\[ x = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \]

Since 5.5 is not an option, the closest choice is 7.

Final Answer: A
