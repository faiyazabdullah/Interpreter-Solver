**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following properties:
- Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\).
- We have an equation to solve: \(z + 5 = 3z - 4\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

The task is to find the value of \(z\) that satisfies the given equation.

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**

Let's solve the equation \(z + 5 = 3z - 4\).

- Start by isolating \(z\) on one side. Subtract \(z\) from both sides:
  \[
  5 = 2z - 4
  \]

- Next, add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \(z\):
  \[
  9 = 2z
  \]

- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(z\):
  \[
  z = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Calculation**

Recheck the steps:
- Original equation: \(z + 5 = 3z - 4\)
- Rearranged: \(5 = 2z - 4\)
- Adjusted: \(9 = 2z\)
- Solved: \(z = 4.5\)

The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \(z\) is 4.5. Among the answer choices:
- A. 4
- B. 4.5
- C. 5
- D. 9.5

The closest and exact match is option B, which is 4.5.

**Step 6: Select the Correct Answer**

Based on the calculations and comparison, the correct answer is option B.

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the equation \(z + 5 = 3z - 4\).
2. Rearrange to isolate \(z\): \(5 = 2z - 4\).
3. Solve for \(z\): \(9 = 2z\) leading to \(z = 4.5\).
4. Verify calculations are correct.
5. Compare with answer choices and select the closest match.

Final Answer: B
