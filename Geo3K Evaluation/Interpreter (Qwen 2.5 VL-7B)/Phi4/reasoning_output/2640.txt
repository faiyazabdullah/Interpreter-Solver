### Analysis of the Given Geometric Constraints

1. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: We are given two cyclic quadrilaterals:
   - \(ABCD\)
   - \(EFDA\)

2. **Angles Subtended by Arcs**:
   - Angle subtended by arc \(BC\) at \(A\) is \(4x + 50\).
   - Angle subtended by arc \(DE\) at \(F\) is \(30\).

3. **Sum of Opposite Angles**:
   - In cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\), the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\).
   - In cyclic quadrilateral \(EFDA\), the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\).

### Identify What Needs to Be Found

We need to find the value of \(x\) such that the given conditions hold true.

### Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties

1. **Angle Subtended by the Same Arc**:
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circle.

2. **Sum of Opposite Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral**:
   - \(\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ\)
   - \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\)

3. **Using the Given Angles**:
   - \(\angle BAC = 4x + 50\)
   - \(\angle EFD = 30\)

### Calculations

1. **For Quadrilateral \(ABCD\)**:
   - Let \(\angle BAC = 4x + 50\).
   - Since \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle BDC\) subtend the same arc \(BC\), \(\angle BDC = 4x + 50\).

2. **Sum of Opposite Angles in \(ABCD\)**:
   - \(\angle BAC + \angle BDC = 180^\circ\)
   - \(2(4x + 50) = 180\)
   - \(8x + 100 = 180\)
   - \(8x = 80\)
   - \(x = 10\)

3. **Verification with Quadrilateral \(EFDA\)**:
   - \(\angle EFD = 30\)
   - \(\angle EAD\) subtends the same arc \(ED\) as \(\angle EFD\), so \(\angle EAD = 30\).

4. **Sum of Opposite Angles in \(EFDA\)**:
   - \(\angle EFD + \angle EAD = 60\)
   - Remaining angles \(\angle FDE + \angle EAF = 120\)
   - This does not affect \(x\) directly, but confirms the cyclic nature.

### Reassessment and Reflection

- The calculations for \(x\) using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and angles subtended by arcs are consistent.
- The derived value \(x = 10\) satisfies the conditions given in the problem.

### Conclusion

The calculations align with the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the given angles. The closest answer choice is \(x = 10\).

</think>

**Solution:**

1. From the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we have:
   \[
   2(4x + 50) = 180 \implies 8x + 100 = 180 \implies 8x = 80 \implies x = 10
   \]

2. Verification with \(EFDA\) confirms the cyclic nature and does not contradict the value of \(x\).

3. The calculated value of \(x\) is \(10\), which matches one of the answer choices.
