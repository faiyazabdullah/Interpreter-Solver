**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given a circle \( C \) and points \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( T \).
- Lines \( AT, BT, CT, DT, \) and \( ET \) are drawn, suggesting \( T \) is a point outside the circle where these lines are tangents.
- Several arcs are defined: \( ATD, TDB, DBE, BEA, EAC, AEC, ADC, DCA, CAD, CDA, CAE \).
- Equal arc measures are given:
  - \( \text{Arc}(A, D, C) = \text{Arc}(D, C, A) = \text{Arc}(C, A, D) = \text{Arc}(C, D, A) \)
  - \( \text{Arc}(A, E, C) = \text{Arc}(E, C, A) \)

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- The arcs \( (A, D, C) \), \( (D, C, A) \), \( (C, A, D) \), and \( (C, D, A) \) are equal.
- The arcs \( (A, E, C) \) and \( (E, C, A) \) are equal.
- Since \( T \) is a point of tangency, the tangents from \( T \) to the circle are equal in length.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- The equal arcs imply that the circle is divided into equal segments by these arcs.
- Since the arcs \( (A, D, C) \), \( (D, C, A) \), \( (C, A, D) \), and \( (C, D, A) \) are equal, they each measure \( \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ \).
- Similarly, arcs \( (A, E, C) \) and \( (E, C, A) \) are equal, each measuring \( \frac{360^\circ}{2} = 180^\circ \).

**Step 4: Determine the Measure of \( m \angle 2 \)**

- \( m \angle 2 \) is formed by the tangents \( AT \) and \( BT \) at point \( T \).
- The angle between two tangents from a point outside a circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
- The intercepted arcs for \( \angle 2 \) are \( \text{Arc}(A, B) \) and \( \text{Arc}(B, A) \).
- Since \( \text{Arc}(A, D, C) = 90^\circ \) and \( \text{Arc}(T, D, B) = 90^\circ \), the total arc \( \text{Arc}(A, B) = 180^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (180^\circ - 0^\circ) = 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Reassess and Refine**

- Verify calculations: \( \text{Arc}(A, B) = 180^\circ \) is consistent with the equal division of the circle.
- \( m \angle 2 = 90^\circ \) is consistent with the geometry of tangents and arcs.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( m \angle 2 = 90^\circ \) does not match any given answer directly.
- The closest answer choice to \( 90^\circ \) is \( 85^\circ \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Given the constraints and the closest match, select \( A. 85 \).

</think> "Solution section"

The measure of \( m \angle 2 \) is calculated to be \( 90^\circ \), and the closest answer choice is \( 85^\circ \).
