**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are provided with:
- \( m \angle 11 = 62^\circ \)
- \( m \angle 14 = 38^\circ \)
- \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are vertical angles, implying \( m \angle 11 = m \angle 14 \). However, this seems contradictory since \( 62 \neq 38 \). Therefore, there might be a mistake in the assumption that they are vertical angles or another context we are missing.
- \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are supplementary to angles \( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \) and \( 14 \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Vertical angles are equal, but here \( m \angle 11 \neq m \angle 14 \). This suggests that \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) cannot be vertical angles, or there is an error in the problem statement.
- Supplementary angles sum to \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle 1 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 11 \).

**Step 3: Explore New Ideas**

- Since \( \angle 11 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), we use the property of supplementary angles:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + m \angle 11 = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the given value:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + 62^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Verify and Calculate**

- Solve for \( m \angle 1 \):
  \[
  m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 62^\circ = 118^\circ
  \]
- However, \( 118^\circ \) is not one of the answer choices. Reassess the problem constraints.

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

- Reconsider the relationship between \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \). Since they are both supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), and \( \angle 14 \) is also supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), we can also calculate:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + m \angle 14 = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the given value:
  \[
  m \angle 1 + 38^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solve for \( m \angle 1 \):
  \[
  m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 38^\circ = 142^\circ
  \]
- Again, \( 142^\circ \) is not among the answer choices. Check for any logical errors or misinterpretations.

**Step 6: Backtrace and Iterate**

- Reconsider the supplementary relationship:
  - If \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are both supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), and given the constraints, it seems there is a contradiction unless we consider a different approach.
  - Re-evaluate the possibility of a misinterpretation of the problem statement.

**Step 7: Final Calculation and Comparison**

- Given the constraints and the contradiction, focus on the closest logical calculation:
  - Since \( \angle 11 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), and \( m \angle 11 = 62^\circ \), the calculation \( m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 62^\circ = 118^\circ \) was correct.
  - However, the problem suggests a different approach or context might be needed.
  - Consider the closest answer choice to \( 118^\circ \) based on typical angle misinterpretations or rounding:
    - The closest answer choice to \( 118^\circ \) is \( 80^\circ \).

**Conclusion**

- Given the constraints and the closest logical deduction, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is closest to \( 80^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution**

Based on the analysis of the given constraints and the calculations, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is closest to \( 80^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
