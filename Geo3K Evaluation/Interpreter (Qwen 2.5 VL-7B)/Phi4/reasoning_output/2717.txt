1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are provided with \( m \angle 3 = 43^\circ \).
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 11 \).

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The problem involves angles labeled as \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \). However, there is no diagram or additional context given, so we need to infer the relationship between these angles based on common geometric configurations.

3. **Consider Common Geometric Relationships:**
   - If angles are part of a transversal intersecting parallel lines, they might be corresponding, alternate interior, alternate exterior, or consecutive interior angles.
   - If angles are part of a polygon, they might be interior or exterior angles.

4. **Explore Possible Relationships:**
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles (e.g., formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines), they would be equal. Thus, \( m \angle 11 = 43^\circ \).
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are alternate interior angles, they would also be equal, leading to \( m \angle 11 = 43^\circ \).
   - If \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are consecutive interior angles (e.g., on the same side of the transversal), their measures would sum to \( 180^\circ \). Thus, \( m \angle 11 = 180^\circ - 43^\circ = 137^\circ \).

5. **Reassess and Verify:**
   - Without additional context, the most straightforward assumptions are that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are either corresponding or alternate interior angles, both leading to \( m \angle 11 = 43^\circ \).
   - The consecutive interior angle scenario is also plausible, leading to \( m \angle 11 = 137^\circ \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The possible measures for \( \angle 11 \) based on common geometric configurations are \( 43^\circ \) and \( 137^\circ \).
   - Among the answer choices, \( 43^\circ \) corresponds to option A, and \( 137^\circ \) corresponds to option D.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the lack of additional context, both \( 43^\circ \) and \( 137^\circ \) are valid based on typical geometric configurations.
   - Since we must choose one, and both are equally plausible without further information, we consider the typical scenario where angles are either corresponding or alternate interior, leading us to choose \( 43^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis of common geometric relationships and the given information, the most straightforward assumption is that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are either corresponding or alternate interior angles, both leading to \( m \angle 11 = 43^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
