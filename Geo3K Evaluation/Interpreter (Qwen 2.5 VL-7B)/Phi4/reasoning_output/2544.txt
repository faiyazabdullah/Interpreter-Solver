1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given a parallelogram \( JKLM \).
   - Points \( J, K, L, M \) define the vertices of the parallelogram.
   - We know that \( \angle JKL \) is equal to \( \angle KLM \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle KLM \), denoted as \( m \angle KLM \).

3. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - In any parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to \( 180^\circ \)).
   - Given \( \angle JKL = \angle KLM \), we can use the property of supplementary angles in a parallelogram.

4. **Set Up Equations Using the Properties:**
   - Let \( \angle JKL = \angle KLM = x \).
   - Since \( \angle JKL \) and \( \angle KLM \) are consecutive angles in the parallelogram, they must be supplementary:
     \[
     x + x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 90^\circ
     \]

5. **Verify Calculations:**
   - The calculation shows \( x = 90^\circ \).
   - This means \( \angle KLM = 90^\circ \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure \( 90^\circ \) does not exactly match any of the provided choices: 71, 79, 81, or 89.
   - We must select the closest value to \( 90^\circ \).

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Among the choices, \( 89 \) is the closest to \( 90^\circ \).

8. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The calculations and reasoning are consistent with the properties of a parallelogram.
   - The choice of \( 89 \) as the closest value to \( 90^\circ \) is logical given the constraints.

</think>
**Solution:**

Based on the properties of a parallelogram and the given conditions, we found that \( m \angle KLM = 90^\circ \). Since \( 90^\circ \) is not an option, the closest available choice is \( 89^\circ \).
