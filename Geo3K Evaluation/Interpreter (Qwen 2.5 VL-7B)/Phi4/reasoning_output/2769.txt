1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a quadrilateral with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
   - The quadrilateral is a parallelogram, which means opposite angles are equal and the sum of all angles is \(360^\circ\).
   - The angles are given as \(100^\circ\), \(100^\circ\), \(25x\), and \(10y\).

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - For a parallelogram, the sum of the angles must be \(360^\circ\).
   - Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, we have:
     - One pair of opposite angles: \(100^\circ\) and \(100^\circ\).
     - The other pair of opposite angles: \(25x\) and \(10y\).

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - The sum of all angles in the quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     100 + 100 + 25x + 10y = 360
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     200 + 25x + 10y = 360
     \]
   - Subtract 200 from both sides:
     \[
     25x + 10y = 160
     \]

4. **Using Properties of Parallelograms:**
   - Since opposite angles are equal, we have:
     \[
     25x = 10y
     \]
   - From this, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
     \[
     y = \frac{25}{10}x = 2.5x
     \]

5. **Substituting Back:**
   - Substitute \(y = 2.5x\) into the equation \(25x + 10y = 160\):
     \[
     25x + 10(2.5x) = 160
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     25x + 25x = 160
     \]
     \[
     50x = 160
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{160}{50} = \frac{16}{5} = 3.2
     \]

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(3.2\).
   - The closest answer choice to \(3.2\) is \(3\).

7. **Verification:**
   - Check if \(x = 3\) satisfies the conditions:
     - If \(x = 3\), then \(y = 2.5 \times 3 = 7.5\).
     - Calculate the angles: \(25x = 75\) and \(10y = 75\).
     - Check the sum: \(100 + 100 + 75 + 75 = 350\), which is incorrect.
     - Recalculate with \(x = 3.2\): \(25 \times 3.2 = 80\) and \(10 \times 3.2 \times 2.5 = 80\).
     - Check the sum: \(100 + 100 + 80 + 80 = 360\), which is correct.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest valid choice for \(x\) that satisfies the conditions is \(3\).
