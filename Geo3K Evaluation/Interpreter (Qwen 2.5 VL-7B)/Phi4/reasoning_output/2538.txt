**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**
- We have two triangles: Triangle \(ABC\) and Triangle \(DEF\).
- All angles in Triangle \(ABC\) are equal: \(\angle ABC = \angle BCA = \angle CAB\).
- All angles in Triangle \(DEF\) are equal: \(\angle DEF = \angle EFD = \angle FDE\).
- This implies both triangles are equilateral, as all internal angles in an equilateral triangle are equal and sum to \(180^\circ\).

**Step 2: Determining the Measure of Each Angle**
- In an equilateral triangle, each angle measures \( \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \).
- Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \angle BCA = \angle CAB = 60^\circ\).
- Similarly, \(\angle DEF = \angle EFD = \angle FDE = 60^\circ\).

**Step 3: Identifying the Measure of \(\angle 3\)**
- The problem asks for the measure of \(\angle 3\), but it doesn't specify which triangle or which angle this refers to.
- Given the constraints and symmetry, it is reasonable to assume \(\angle 3\) refers to an angle in one of the equilateral triangles.
- Since both triangles are equilateral, any angle labeled as \(\angle 3\) in either triangle would measure \(60^\circ\).

**Step 4: Comparing with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure for \(\angle 3\) is \(60^\circ\).
- Among the answer choices provided (A. 52, B. 56, C. 60, D. 68), the closest and exact match is \(60^\circ\).

**Step 5: Final Verification**
- Reassess the problem constraints and calculations to ensure no details were overlooked.
- Confirm that the assumption of \(\angle 3\) being an angle in one of the equilateral triangles is consistent with the given information.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
- The measure of \(\angle 3\) is \(60^\circ\), matching choice C.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the properties of equilateral triangles, both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEF\) have all angles equal to \(60^\circ\). Therefore, any angle labeled as \(\angle 3\) in either triangle would measure \(60^\circ\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C. 60
