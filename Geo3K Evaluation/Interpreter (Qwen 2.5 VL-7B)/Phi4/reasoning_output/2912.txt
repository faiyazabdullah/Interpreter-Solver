**Step 1: Analyze the Question and Constraints**

- We are given that in a geometric figure involving Triangle \( G \), there are points and angles labeled as \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \).
- We know that the measure of \( \angle 12 \) is 64 degrees: \( m\angle 12 = 64^\circ \).
- The task is to find the measure of \( \angle 7 \).

**Step 2: Identify Geometric Relationships**

- Since \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are mentioned together in the context of a triangle, it's reasonable to consider that they may be related through a common geometric property, such as being part of the same triangle or forming a linear pair.
- Common geometric relationships involving angles include:
  - The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - Linear pairs (adjacent angles on a straight line) sum to \( 180^\circ \).
  - Vertical angles are equal.

**Step 3: Explore Possible Scenarios**

- **Scenario 1:** If \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are part of the same triangle, then they are two of the three angles in the triangle.
  - If we assume they are in the same triangle, the third angle would be \( 180^\circ - 64^\circ - m\angle 7 \).
- **Scenario 2:** If \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \) form a linear pair, then \( m\angle 7 = 180^\circ - 64^\circ = 116^\circ \). This doesn't match any answer choices, so it might not be the case.
- **Scenario 3:** If \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles, then \( m\angle 7 = 64^\circ \).

**Step 4: Reassess and Reflect**

- Scenario 1 requires additional information about the third angle to determine \( m\angle 7 \).
- Scenario 2 leads to a measure not in the answer choices.
- Scenario 3 directly gives \( m\angle 7 = 64^\circ \), which matches answer choice B.

**Step 5: Verify and Conclude**

- Without additional information, the most straightforward assumption is that \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles, leading to \( m\angle 7 = 64^\circ \).
- This matches answer choice B.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the analysis of possible relationships between \( \angle 12 \) and \( \angle 7 \), the most plausible scenario is that they are vertical angles, making their measures equal. Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 7 \) is \( 64^\circ \).
