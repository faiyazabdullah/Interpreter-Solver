1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - The sides are \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{BC} \), and \( \overline{CA} \).
   - It is specified that \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle, meaning \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of the variable \( x \) in the context of the given geometric setup.
   - The problem suggests that \( x \) is likely associated with one of the angles in the triangle, as angle measures are typically represented with variables in such problems.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always \( 180^\circ \).
   - Given \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \), the sum of the remaining two angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) must be \( 90^\circ \) because \( 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( \angle BAC = x \).
   - Then \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ - x \) because the sum of \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) must be \( 90^\circ \).

5. **Verify and Calculate:**
   - We need to determine which of the provided answer choices fits the possible values for \( x \).
   - The possible values for \( x \) must be such that both \( x \) and \( 90^\circ - x \) are valid angle measures (i.e., between \( 0^\circ \) and \( 90^\circ \)).

6. **Consider the Answer Choices:**
   - A. \( 55^\circ \)
   - B. \( 115^\circ \)
   - C. \( 125^\circ \)
   - D. \( 135^\circ \)

7. **Evaluate Each Choice:**
   - \( x = 55^\circ \) is a valid angle measure for \( \angle BAC \), and \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ \), which is also valid.
   - \( x = 115^\circ \), \( x = 125^\circ \), and \( x = 135^\circ \) are not valid because they would make \( \angle BCA \) negative, which is not possible for an angle in a triangle.

8. **Select the Closest Valid Answer:**
   - The only valid choice that fits within the constraints is \( x = 55^\circ \).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the value of \( x \) that satisfies the conditions is \( 55^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and the requirement that \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \), the remaining angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) must sum to \( 90^\circ \). Letting \( \angle BAC = x \), we find \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ - x \). The only valid choice for \( x \) from the provided options is \( 55^\circ \), as it keeps both angles positive and within the range of possible angle measures in a triangle.
