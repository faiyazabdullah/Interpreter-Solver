**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We have two triangles, \(\triangle PQR\) and \(\triangle PSR\), with the following points and lines:
- Points: \(P, Q, R, S, T, U\)
- Lines: \(PQ, QR, RS, SP, QT, QS\)
- Right angles: \(\angle PQT\) and \(\angle RQS\)
- Equal lengths: \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\)

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

The given conditions imply:
- \(\triangle PQR\) and \(\triangle PSR\) are part of a geometric figure with equal sides, suggesting a rhombus or square.
- \(\angle PQT\) and \(\angle RQS\) being right angles indicate that lines \(PQ\) and \(QR\) are perpendicular, and lines \(RQ\) and \(QS\) are perpendicular.

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Properties**

Since \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\) and we have right angles at \(\angle PQT\) and \(\angle RQS\), the quadrilateral \(PQRS\) is a rhombus with all sides equal and two consecutive right angles. This implies \(PQRS\) is a square.

**Step 4: Verify and Refine**

In a square:
- All sides are equal.
- Diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.

Given \(\angle PQT\) is a right angle, \(QT\) is perpendicular to \(PQ\), and since \(PQ = QR\), \(PQ\) and \(QR\) form a right angle at \(Q\).

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect**

Since \(PQRS\) is a square, the diagonals \(PR\) and \(QS\) are equal and bisect each other at right angles. The length of each side of the square is equal, and the diagonals are \(\sqrt{2}\) times the side length.

**Step 6: Calculate the Side Length**

Let the side length of the square be \(x\). The diagonal \(PR\) (or \(QS\)) is \(x\sqrt{2}\).

Since \(\angle PQT\) and \(\angle RQS\) are right angles, and \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle PQT\) or \(\triangle RQS\).

For \(\triangle PQT\):
- \(PQ^2 + QT^2 = PT^2\)
- Since \(\angle PQT\) is a right angle, and \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\), let \(PQ = x\).
- \(x^2 + QT^2 = (x\sqrt{2})^2\)
- \(x^2 + QT^2 = 2x^2\)
- \(QT^2 = x^2\)
- \(QT = x\)

Since \(PQ = x\) and \(QT = x\), and \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\), the side length \(x\) must satisfy the condition of forming a square with equal diagonals.

**Step 7: Solve for \(PQ\)**

Given the choices, we need to find \(PQ\) such that it forms a square with integer side lengths. The diagonal \(PR\) or \(QS\) is \(x\sqrt{2}\).

Testing integer values:
- If \(x = 3\), diagonal \(= 3\sqrt{2} \approx 4.24\)
- If \(x = 4\), diagonal \(= 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.66\)
- If \(x = 6\), diagonal \(= 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.49\)
- If \(x = 9\), diagonal \(= 9\sqrt{2} \approx 12.73\)

The diagonal must be an integer for a perfect square grid, and \(4\sqrt{2}\) is closest to an integer value (5.66 is closest to 6).

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

The closest integer side length that forms a square with a diagonal close to an integer is when \(PQ = 4\).

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the side length \(PQ\) that fits the geometric conditions is 4.
