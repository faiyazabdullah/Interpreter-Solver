<think>
1. **Understand the Given Information**: The problem provides several equalities concerning line segments within a quadrilateral QPRS, which involves additional points T and R.

   - Lengths of segments: PT = ST = TR = QT = PR
   - Given values: ST = 8, TR = 4, PT = 6

2. **Summarize Key Equations**:
   - PT = ST = TR = QT = PR
   - Given: ST = 8, TR = 4, PT = 6

   From the given equalities, we can conclude:
   - PT = 6
   - ST = 8
   - TR = 4
   - QT = PR = 6 (since QT = PT and PR = PT)

3. **Analyze Geometric Configuration**:
   - Points P, S, T, and R form part of a kite or rhombus structure because several pairs of lengths are equal.
   - In a rhombus or kite, diagonals intersect at right angles. Here, PT, QT, TR, and ST are all equal in length.

4. **Determine Position of Points**:
   - T is the midpoint of PR (since PT = TR).
   - Given PT = 6 and TR = 4, PR should be 10, but it's given as 6, indicating a potential geometric setup where diagonals are not simple sums.

5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - Consider the quadrilateral PQRT, where QT = PT = 6, TR = 4.
   - We need to find QR. Consider triangle QRT, where QT = 6 and TR = 4.

6. **Calculate QR**:
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle QRT:
     \[
     QR^2 = QT^2 + TR^2 = 6^2 + 4^2 = 36 + 16 = 52
     \]
     \[
     QR = \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{4 \times 13} = 2\sqrt{13}
     \]

7. **Approximate \(\sqrt{13}\)**:
   - \(\sqrt{13} \approx 3.605\)
   - Therefore, \(QR \approx 2 \times 3.605 = 7.21\)

8. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The closest value to 7.21 is 8.

9. **Verification**:
   - Reassess the setup and calculations to ensure no steps were overlooked.
   - The setup of the problem and the use of the Pythagorean theorem are consistent with the given constraints.

</think>
Solution:
Based on the analysis and calculations, the length QR is approximately 7.21, which is closest to the answer choice 8.
