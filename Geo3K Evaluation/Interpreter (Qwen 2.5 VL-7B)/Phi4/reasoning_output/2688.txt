**Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement**

- We are given a parallelogram \(WXYZ\) with the following properties:
  - \(WX\) is a side of the parallelogram.
  - \(XY\) is a side of the parallelogram.
  - \(YZ\) is a side of the parallelogram.
  - \(ZW\) is a side of the parallelogram.
- We have equalities:
  - \( \text{Length of } WX = \text{Length of } YZ \)
  - \( \text{Length of } XY = \text{Length of } YZ \)
- We need to find \( \text{Length of } ZW \), denoted by \(t\).

**Step 2: Understand Parallelogram Properties**

- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Thus:
  - \( WX = YZ \)
  - \( XY = ZW \)
- The given information is:
  - \( WX = YZ \)
  - \( XY = YZ \)

**Step 3: Derive Relationships**

From the properties and given conditions:
- \( WX = YZ \)
- \( XY = YZ \)

Since both \(WX\) and \(XY\) are equal to \(YZ\), we can infer:
- \( WX = XY = YZ \)

**Step 4: Use Parallelogram Property**

From the parallelogram property:
- \( XY = ZW \)

Since \( XY = YZ \), we have:
- \( ZW = YZ \)

**Step 5: Determine \(t\)**

Given that all sides \(WX\), \(XY\), and \(YZ\) are equal, and \(ZW = YZ\), it follows that all sides of the parallelogram are equal, implying it is a rhombus.

Thus, \(t = YZ\).

**Step 6: Consider Answer Choices**

We need to find the closest value of \(t\) from the given choices:
- A. 6
- B. 7
- C. 8
- D. 13

Since \(t = YZ\) and all sides are equal, \(t\) must be equal to the length of any of these sides. Without specific numerical values given for \(WX\), \(XY\), or \(YZ\), we assume a reasonable integer value for a side length that fits the context of typical geometric problems.

**Step 7: Choose the Closest Answer**

Given the typical nature of such problems and the options provided, a reasonable assumption for the side length of a rhombus (where all sides are equal) would be a moderate integer value. Among the options, 6, 7, 8, and 13, the most reasonable and common side length for a geometric figure like a rhombus would be 8.

**Step 8: Conclusion**

Based on the reasoning and typical geometric assumptions, the closest and most reasonable value for \(t\) is 8.

**Solution**

Given the properties of the parallelogram and the equalities provided, we determined that all sides of the parallelogram are equal, making it a rhombus. Therefore, \(t = YZ\), and the most reasonable value for \(t\) among the given choices is 8.
