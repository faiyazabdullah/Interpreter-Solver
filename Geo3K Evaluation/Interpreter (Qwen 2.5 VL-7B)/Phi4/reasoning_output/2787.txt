**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a circle \( B \) with point \( B \) as the center.
- Arc \( QS \) is part of the circle with center \( B \).
- Angle \( QBS \) and angle \( RBS \) are equal, implying \( Q \) and \( R \) are symmetric with respect to \( S \).
- Angle \( QBS \) is an inscribed angle of arc \( QT \), and angle \( RBS \) is an inscribed angle of arc \( RT \).
- Arc \( QT \) is a central angle of \( \angle QBS \).
- Angle \( QTS \) is a central angle of arc \( QS \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( \angle QBS = \angle RBS \), arcs \( QS \) and \( RS \) are equal.
- \( \angle QBS \) and \( \angle RBS \) are inscribed angles subtending arcs \( QT \) and \( RT \) respectively.
- \( \angle QTS \) is the central angle subtending arc \( QS \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
- Therefore, \( \text{Measure of } \angle QBS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } QT \).
- Similarly, \( \text{Measure of } \angle RBS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } RT \).
- Since \( \angle QBS = \angle RBS \), arcs \( QT \) and \( RT \) are equal.

**Step 4: Determine \( m \widehat{QTS} \)**

- \( \angle QTS \) is the central angle subtending arc \( QS \).
- Since \( \angle QBS \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( QT \), and \( \angle QTS \) is a central angle subtending arc \( QS \), we have:
  \[
  \text{Measure of arc } QS = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle QBS
  \]
- Since \( \angle QBS \) and \( \angle RBS \) are equal, and \( \angle QBS \) subtends arc \( QT \), we have:
  \[
  \text{Measure of arc } QT = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle QBS
  \]
- Therefore, \( \text{Measure of arc } QS = \text{Measure of arc } QT \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( m \widehat{QTS} \)**

- Since \( \angle QTS \) is the central angle subtending arc \( QS \), and \( \text{Measure of arc } QS = \text{Measure of arc } QT \), we have:
  \[
  m \widehat{QTS} = \text{Measure of arc } QS = \text{Measure of arc } QT
  \]
- Since \( \angle QBS \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( QT \), and \( \text{Measure of } \angle QBS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } QT \), we have:
  \[
  \text{Measure of arc } QT = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle QBS
  \]
- Since \( \angle QBS = \angle RBS \), and both subtend equal arcs \( QT \) and \( RT \), the total arc \( QTR \) is \( 360^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( \text{Measure of arc } QS = 180^\circ \) (since \( QS \) and \( RS \) are equal and symmetric about \( S \)).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( m \widehat{QTS} \) is \( 180^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 180^\circ \) is \( 212^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis, the measure of \( m \widehat{QTS} \) is closest to \( 212^\circ \).
