1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - We know the lines forming the triangle: \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{BC} \), and \( \overline{CA} \).
   - We are given the angle \( \angle ABC \) and its measure is equal to \( \angle A \) and \( \angle B \).
   - We also know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - From the problem, we have:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle A = \text{Measure of } \angle B = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the measure of \( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), and \( \angle ABC \).
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is:
     \[
     \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     x + x + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     2x + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Since \( \angle C \) is the remaining angle, express it in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     \angle C = 180^\circ - 2x
     \]
   - Since all angles \( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), and \( \angle ABC \) are equal, the triangle is isosceles with \( \angle A = \angle B = \angle ABC = x \).
   - We need to find \( x \) such that:
     \[
     3x = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ
     \]

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 60^\circ \).
   - The closest answer choice to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 56^\circ \).

6. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - Since \( 60^\circ \) is not an option, the closest choice is \( 56^\circ \).

</think>

Solution:
Based on the calculations and analysis, the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 60^\circ \). The closest answer choice to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 56^\circ \).
