1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a rectangle \(DEFG\) which means all angles are right angles, i.e., \(90^\circ\).
   - We are given that \(\angle EFD = 2x - 3\) and \(\angle DFG = x + 12\).
   - Since \(DEFG\) is a rectangle, \(\angle DFE\) and \(\angle EFD\) are both right angles, each \(90^\circ\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \(m\angle EFD\), which is given as \(2x - 3\).

3. **Using Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \(D, F, E\) are consecutive vertices of a rectangle and \(\angle DFE = 90^\circ\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \angle DFE = \angle DFG + \angle EFD = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the given expressions:
     \[
     (x + 12) + (2x - 3) = 90
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     x + 12 + 2x - 3 = 90
     \]
     \[
     3x + 9 = 90
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     3x = 90 - 9
     \]
     \[
     3x = 81
     \]
     \[
     x = 27
     \]

5. **Calculate \(m\angle EFD\):**
   - Substitute \(x = 27\) into \(m\angle EFD = 2x - 3\):
     \[
     m\angle EFD = 2(27) - 3
     \]
     \[
     m\angle EFD = 54 - 3
     \]
     \[
     m\angle EFD = 51
     \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(m\angle EFD = 51\), which matches choice A.

7. **Verification:**
   - Double-check the calculations:
     - \(x = 27\) was correctly calculated.
     - Substituting \(x = 27\) into \(2x - 3\) yields \(51\), confirming the solution.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated value matches choice A, and all steps have been verified for correctness.

<Solution>
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle EFD\) is \(51^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
