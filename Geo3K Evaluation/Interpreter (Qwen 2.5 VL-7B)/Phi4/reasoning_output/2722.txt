1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle EFD\).
   - \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ABC\) being the right angle.
   - \(\triangle EFD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle EFD\) being the right angle.
   - The triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
   - All sides of \(\triangle ABC\) are equal, indicating it is an isosceles right triangle.
   - All sides of \(\triangle EFD\) are equal, indicating it is also an isosceles right triangle.

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - Since \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles and right-angled, if each side is \(x\), then by the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(AC\) is \(x\sqrt{2}\).
   - Similarly, for \(\triangle EFD\), if each side is \(y\), then the hypotenuse \(ED\) is \(y\sqrt{2}\).

3. **Explore the Problem:**
   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal.
   - Let the side lengths of \(\triangle ABC\) be \(x\), so \(AB = BC = CA = x\).
   - Let the side lengths of \(\triangle EFD\) be \(y\), so \(EF = FD = DE = y\).

4. **Set Up Proportions:**
   - The ratio of the hypotenuses is \(\frac{AC}{ED} = \frac{x\sqrt{2}}{y\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x}{y}\).
   - The ratio of the legs is \(\frac{AB}{EF} = \frac{x}{y}\).

5. **Verify and Calculate:**
   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio \(\frac{x}{y}\) is constant for all corresponding sides.
   - Given that all sides of \(\triangle ABC\) are equal, and all sides of \(\triangle EFD\) are equal, the ratio \(\frac{x}{y}\) must be the same for all sides.

6. **Determine the Value of \(y\):**
   - Since the triangles are similar and all sides of \(\triangle ABC\) are equal, assume \(x = 5\) (a common side length for isosceles right triangles).
   - Then, the hypotenuse \(AC = 5\sqrt{2}\).
   - For \(\triangle EFD\), assume \(y\) is the side length, then \(ED = y\sqrt{2}\).
   - Set up the proportion: \(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{y\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5}{y}\).
   - Simplifying gives \(\frac{5}{y} = \frac{5}{y}\), which holds true for any \(y\) that maintains the similarity ratio.

7. **Choose the Closest Answer:**
   - Since \(x = 5\), and the triangles are similar with equal side ratios, \(y\) must also be 5 to maintain the proportionality.
   - Therefore, the closest answer choice is \(y = 5\).

8. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Verify that the similarity and equality of side lengths lead to \(y = 5\) being the only consistent solution.
   - Re-evaluate the assumptions and calculations to ensure no errors.

9. **Finalize the Solution:**
   - The calculated value of \(y\) is consistent with the given constraints and the similarity of the triangles.
   - The closest answer choice is \(y = 5\).

</think>

**Solution:**
Given the similarity and equal side lengths of the isosceles right triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle EFD\), the side lengths must be proportional. Assuming \(x = 5\) for \(\triangle ABC\), the corresponding side length \(y\) for \(\triangle EFD\) must also be 5 to maintain the similarity ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
