**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two circles, \(\odot S\) and \(\odot R\).
- The diameter of \(\odot S\) is 30 units, so the radius \(r_S = \frac{30}{2} = 15\) units.
- The diameter of \(\odot R\) is 20 units, so the radius \(r_R = \frac{20}{2} = 10\) units.
- The distance \(DS = 9\) units.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the distance \(RC\), where \(C\) is the center of \(\odot S\) and \(R\) is the center of \(\odot R\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**

- Since \(D\) is a point on \(\odot S\), the distance \(DC = 15\) units (radius of \(\odot S\)).
- We can use the triangle inequality or Pythagorean theorem in the context of a triangle formed by points \(D\), \(R\), and \(C\).

**Step 4: Set Up the Geometric Relationship**

- Consider the triangle \(\triangle DRC\).
- We know \(DS = 9\), \(DC = 15\), and we need to find \(RC\).

**Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

- Since \(D\) is on \(\odot S\), \(DC = 15\).
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle DRC\):
  \[
  RC^2 = DC^2 - DS^2
  \]
  \[
  RC^2 = 15^2 - 9^2
  \]
  \[
  RC^2 = 225 - 81
  \]
  \[
  RC^2 = 144
  \]
  \[
  RC = \sqrt{144} = 12
  \]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare**

- The calculated \(RC = 12\) units.
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 4, B. 6, C. 9, D. 12.
- The calculated value matches option D.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the geometric constraints and the given data.
- The closest and exact match is option D.

**Solution:**

- We calculated \(RC\) using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle DRC\) and found \(RC = 12\) units.
- The correct answer choice is D.
