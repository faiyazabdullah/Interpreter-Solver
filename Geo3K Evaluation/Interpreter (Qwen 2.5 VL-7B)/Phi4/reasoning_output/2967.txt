1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) and a triangle \(ACE\).
   - \(CE = t - 2\), \(EB = t + 1\), \(CD = 2\), and \(CA = 10\).
   - We need to find \(CE\).

2. **Identify Relationships:**
   - Since \(C\) is a common point in both the quadrilateral and the triangle, and \(E\) is on line \(AB\), we can use the triangle inequality or properties of triangles and lines.
   - \(CE\) and \(EB\) are parts of line \(CB\), so \(CE + EB = CB\).

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the given, \(CE = t - 2\) and \(EB = t + 1\).
   - Therefore, \(CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1\).
   - We need to find \(CB\) to solve for \(t\).

4. **Use Geometric Constraints:**
   - Since \(C\) and \(A\) are points on the quadrilateral, and \(CA = 10\), we can consider the triangle \(CAB\) or \(CDE\) to find \(CB\).
   - However, without additional information about angles or other distances, we assume \(CB\) is the sum of \(CE\) and \(EB\).

5. **Solve for \(t\):**
   - We know \(CD = 2\) and \(CA = 10\), but these do not directly help find \(CB\) without additional angles or perpendiculars.
   - Assume \(CB\) is the sum of \(CE\) and \(EB\) since no other information is provided: \(CB = CE + EB = 2t - 1\).

6. **Check Consistency:**
   - We need to find a consistent value for \(t\) that satisfies the given lengths.
   - Since \(CE = t - 2\), we need to find \(t\) such that \(CE\) is a positive length.

7. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   - Assume \(CB\) is a reasonable length given \(CA = 10\) and \(CD = 2\).
   - If \(CB = 10\) (a reasonable assumption given \(CA\) and \(CD\)), then:
     \[
     2t - 1 = 10 \implies 2t = 11 \implies t = 5.5
     \]
   - Substitute \(t = 5.5\) into \(CE = t - 2\):
     \[
     CE = 5.5 - 2 = 3.5
     \]

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(CE = 3.5\).
   - The closest answer choice to \(3.5\) is \(4\).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest answer choice to the calculated \(CE\) is \(4\).

</think>
Solution:
Given the calculations and assumptions, the closest answer choice to \(CE = 3.5\) is \(4\). Therefore, the final answer is:
