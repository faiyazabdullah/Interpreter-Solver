1. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - We have a rhombus with diagonals AC and BX.
   - The problem states that one diagonal is twice as long as the other, but it doesn't specify which is longer. We'll assume \( AC = 2 \times BX \).
   - The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.
   - We need to find the lengths of the diagonals.

2. **Recall Geometric Properties:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using its diagonals: 
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
     where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.
   - Given \( AC = 2 \times BX \), let \( BX = x \). Then \( AC = 2x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for the diagonals into the area formula:
     \[
     169 = \frac{1}{2} \times (2x) \times x
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x^2 = x^2
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - From the equation \( x^2 = 169 \), solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \sqrt{169} = 13
     \]
   - Therefore, \( BX = 13 \) and \( AC = 2 \times 13 = 26 \).

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the calculations:
     - If \( BX = 13 \) and \( AC = 26 \), then the area is:
       \[
       A = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 338 = 169
       \]
     - The calculated area matches the given area, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The lengths of the diagonals are 13 and 26.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 6.5
     - B. 13
     - C. 26
     - D. 52
   - The correct lengths from the options are 13 and 26.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since both 13 and 26 are among the choices, and the problem asks for the lengths of the diagonals, we select the larger one as the primary answer since it is not specified which diagonal is asked for.
   - Therefore, the closest answer choice is C. 26.

</think>

**Solution:**

- We determined the lengths of the diagonals to be 13 and 26 millimeters.
- The problem asks for the lengths of the diagonals, and since both are possible, we choose the larger one, 26, as the primary answer.
- The correct answer choice is C. 26.
