### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( AB \) as the hypotenuse.
   - \( AB \) is also the diameter of the circle with center \( D \).
   - \( AC = 8 \) inches and \( BC = 15 \) inches.
   - We need to find the radius of the circle.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We are tasked with finding the radius of the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle and \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, by the Thales' theorem, the right angle is at \( C \).
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AB \):
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289
     \]
     \[
     AB = \sqrt{289} = 17
     \]

4. **Determine the Radius:**
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, the radius \( r \) is half of \( AB \):
     \[
     r = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
     \]

5. **Verify Calculations:**
   - Recalculate \( AB \) using the Pythagorean theorem to ensure no arithmetic errors.
   - Confirm that \( AB = 17 \) is correct.
   - Calculate the radius again: \( r = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5 \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated radius is \( 8.5 \).
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 7.5, B. 8, C. 8.5, D. 17.
   - The closest match is option C: 8.5.

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Ensure all steps align with geometric principles and calculations are accurate.
   - Confirm that the use of Thales' theorem and the Pythagorean theorem are appropriate.

8. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the calculations and comparisons, the correct choice is C.

### Solution
By applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we found that the hypotenuse \( AB \) is 17 inches. Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, the radius is half of \( AB \), which is 8.5 inches. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest match is option C. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 8.5 inches.

Final Answer: C
