1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a pentagon \(ABCDE\) and several triangles: \(FBC\), \(EBD\), and \(ABD\).
   - We are given that \(\angle 1 = \angle 2 = \angle 3\), which are \(\angle FBC\), \(\angle EBD\), and \(\angle ABD\), respectively.
   - \(\angle 4 = \angle 5\), which are \(\angle ADG\) and \(\angle ADG\) (note: \(\angle 5\) is repeated, possibly a typo).
   - The lengths \(BC = BD = DE = FA\) are equal.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle 7\), which is not directly defined in the problem. We assume it might be related to the given angles.

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(\angle 1 = \angle 2 = \angle 3\) and the lines \(BC\), \(BD\), and \(DE\) are equal, triangles \(FBC\), \(EBD\), and \(ABD\) are isosceles.
   - The equality of angles suggests symmetry, possibly implying that \(\angle FBC\), \(\angle EBD\), and \(\angle ABD\) are equal angles in an equilateral triangle configuration.
   - Given \(\angle 4 = \angle 5\), \(\angle ADG\) is an isosceles triangle with \(AD = DG\).

4. **Explore the Implications:**
   - Since \(BC = BD = DE = FA\), consider the possibility of equilateral triangles or symmetry.
   - The equality of angles \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\) suggests they might be \(60^\circ\) each if they form equilateral triangles.

5. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The problem suggests symmetry and equal angles, leading to the hypothesis that \(\angle 1 = \angle 2 = \angle 3 = 60^\circ\).
   - If \(\angle 4 = \angle 5\), and considering the symmetry, \(\angle ADG\) might also be \(60^\circ\).

6. **Backtrace and Iterate:**
   - If \(\angle 1 = \angle 2 = \angle 3 = 60^\circ\), then the triangles \(FBC\), \(EBD\), and \(ABD\) are equilateral.
   - The measure of \(\angle 4 = \angle 5\) suggests \(\angle ADG\) is also \(60^\circ\).

7. **Determine \(\angle 7\):**
   - Given the symmetry and equal angles, \(\angle 7\) might be an external angle or related to the configuration of the pentagon.
   - If \(\angle 4 = \angle 5 = 60^\circ\), and considering the symmetry, \(\angle 7\) could be supplementary to \(\angle 4\) or \(\angle 5\).

8. **Calculate and Compare:**
   - If \(\angle 4 = 60^\circ\), then \(\angle 7\) could be \(180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ\).
   - However, considering the options, \(\angle 7\) might be an internal angle related to the pentagon's configuration.

9. **Final Consideration:**
   - Given the symmetry and equal angles, \(\angle 7\) might be \(180^\circ - 2 \times 60^\circ = 60^\circ\).
   - However, considering the options, the closest logical choice is \(120^\circ\), which is not listed.
   - Re-evaluate: If \(\angle 7\) is supplementary to an internal angle, it might be \(180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ\).
   - Given the options, the closest to a typical internal angle in such configurations is \(69^\circ\).

</think>
<Solution>
Given the symmetry and equal angles, \(\angle 7\) is likely related to the internal angles of the pentagon or triangles. Considering the options and typical configurations, the closest measure is \(69^\circ\).
