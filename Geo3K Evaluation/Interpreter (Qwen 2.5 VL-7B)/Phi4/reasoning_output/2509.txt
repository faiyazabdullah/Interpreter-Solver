**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**  
- We are given that \( m \angle 1 = 123^\circ \).  
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 14 \).  

**Step 2: Consider Possible Geometric Relationships**  
- Without a figure, we must consider common geometric scenarios involving angles, such as parallel lines cut by a transversal, cyclic quadrilaterals, or angles around a point.
- Given the number of angles, it is possible that these angles form a polygon or involve parallel lines with transversals.

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Theorems and Properties**  
- If angles are formed by parallel lines and a transversal, we might use alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, or supplementary angles.
- If angles are around a point, the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).
- If angles form a polygon, the sum of interior angles of an \(n\)-sided polygon is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\).

**Step 4: Hypothesize a Scenario**  
- Consider the possibility of parallel lines cut by a transversal. If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles, they would be equal.
- If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are supplementary (e.g., consecutive interior angles), then \( m \angle 14 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ \).

**Step 5: Verify and Refine the Hypothesis**  
- Check if the supplementary angle scenario fits any common geometric configurations, such as a transversal intersecting two parallel lines.
- If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are supplementary, then \( m \angle 14 = 57^\circ \), which matches answer choice B.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**  
- Consider if there are other configurations where \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) could be related differently, but given the options, the supplementary scenario is the most straightforward.
- Ensure that no other relationships (like cyclic quadrilateral properties) are more applicable without additional information.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**  
- Given the analysis and the options provided, the most logical conclusion is that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are supplementary, leading to \( m \angle 14 = 57^\circ \).

**Solution**:

Based on the analysis of possible geometric configurations and the given information, the most plausible relationship is that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are supplementary angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines. Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 14 \) is:

\[ m \angle 14 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
