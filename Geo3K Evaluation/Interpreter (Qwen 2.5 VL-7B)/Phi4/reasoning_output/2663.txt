### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a trapezoid \( G H J K \) with the following properties:
- \( G J \parallel H K \) (i.e., \( G J \) and \( H K \) are the parallel sides, making \( G J \) the top base and \( H K \) the bottom base).
- The area of the trapezoid is \( 188.35 \) square feet.
- The length of the top base \( H J \) is \( 16.5 \) feet.
- We need to find the length of the bottom base \( G K \).

**Step 2: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Trapezoid**

The formula for the area \( A \) of a trapezoid with bases \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \), and height \( h \) is:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]

Here, \( b_1 = H J = 16.5 \) feet, \( b_2 = G K \), and \( A = 188.35 \) square feet.

**Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the length of \( G K \). We can rearrange the area formula to solve for \( G K \).

**Step 4: Express the Height in Terms of Known Quantities**

Rearrange the area formula to solve for the height \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{2A}{b_1 + b_2}
\]

Since we don't know \( G K \) yet, we will use this expression later.

**Step 5: Substitute Known Values and Solve for \( G K \)**

Substitute the known values into the area formula:
\[
188.35 = \frac{1}{2} \times (16.5 + G K) \times h
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + G K}
\]

**Step 6: Use the Formula to Find \( G K \)**

We need another equation to solve for \( G K \). Notice that the height \( h \) must be consistent with the area formula. Let's isolate \( G K \) by assuming a reasonable height and checking consistency.

Assume \( h \) is a reasonable value, such as 8 feet (a typical height for a trapezoid with these dimensions), and solve for \( G K \):
\[
188.35 = \frac{1}{2} \times (16.5 + G K) \times 8
\]

Simplify:
\[
188.35 = 4 \times (16.5 + G K)
\]

\[
188.35 = 66 + 4G K
\]

\[
122.35 = 4G K
\]

\[
G K = \frac{122.35}{4} = 30.5875
\]

Since 30.5875 is not an option, let's try another approach by testing the given options.

**Step 7: Test Each Option**

- **Option A: \( G K = 5.1 \)**
  \[
  h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + 5.1} = \frac{376.7}{21.6} \approx 17.44
  \]
  This height seems unreasonable for a trapezoid with a base of 16.5 feet.

- **Option B: \( G K = 21.6 \)**
  \[
  h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + 21.6} = \frac{376.7}{38.1} \approx 9.88
  \]
  This height is reasonable.

- **Option C: \( G K = 22.8 \)**
  \[
  h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + 22.8} = \frac{376.7}{39.3} \approx 9.58
  \]
  This height is also reasonable.

- **Option D: \( G K = 26.8 \)**
  \[
  h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + 26.8} = \frac{376.7}{43.3} \approx 8.69
  \]
  This height is reasonable as well.

**Step 8: Choose the Closest Option**

Given the calculations, \( G K = 21.6 \) feet results in a height of approximately 9.88 feet, which is a reasonable height for a trapezoid with these dimensions. This option is consistent with the area calculation.

<Solution>

### Solution Section

To find the length of \( G K \), we used the area formula for a trapezoid:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
188.35 = \frac{1}{2} \times (16.5 + G K) \times h
\]

Rearranging for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{2 \times 188.35}{16.5 + G K}
\]

Testing the options, we found that \( G K = 21.6 \) feet gives a reasonable height of approximately 9.88 feet, which is consistent with the area of 188.35 square feet.

Thus, the closest and most reasonable answer is:
