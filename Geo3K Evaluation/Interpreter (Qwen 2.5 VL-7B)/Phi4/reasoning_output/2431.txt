1. **Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a regular hexagon \( UVWXYZ \) where each side is 12 cm.
   - In a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. Each interior angle is 120 degrees.
   - The line \( WY \) is a diagonal of the hexagon, specifically connecting two vertices that are separated by one vertex in between (i.e., \( W \) and \( Y \) skip vertex \( X \)).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to determine the length of the diagonal \( WY \).

3. **Applying Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - In a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be categorized based on their lengths. The longest diagonal connects two opposite vertices and is twice the side length. The shorter diagonal (like \( WY \)) connects vertices with one vertex in between and can be derived using the properties of equilateral triangles.
   - The shorter diagonal of a regular hexagon can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Shorter diagonal} = \sqrt{3} \times \text{side length}
     \]
   - This comes from dividing the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles. The diagonal \( WY \) is the longer side of a 30-60-90 triangle formed by splitting one of these equilateral triangles in half.

4. **Calculations:**
   - Given the side length \( s = 12 \) cm, the length of the diagonal \( WY \) is:
     \[
     WY = \sqrt{3} \times 12 = 12\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}
     \]

5. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length \( 12\sqrt{3} \) matches choice C: \( 12\sqrt{3} \).

6. **Verification and Conclusion:**
   - The calculation is consistent with the properties of a regular hexagon and the known formula for the shorter diagonal.
   - Therefore, the closest and correct answer choice is C.

</think>

**Solution:**
- In a regular hexagon, the shorter diagonal (like \( WY \)) is calculated as \( \sqrt{3} \times \) the side length.
- Given the side length is 12 cm, the length of \( WY \) is \( 12\sqrt{3} \) cm.
- Comparing this with the provided options, the correct answer is \( 12\sqrt{3} \).
