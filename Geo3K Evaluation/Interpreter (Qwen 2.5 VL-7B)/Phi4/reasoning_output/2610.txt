**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

The problem provides a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
- \( \angle ABC \) being the right angle.
- \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

We need to find the length \( y \) of one of the sides, but it isn't specified directly which one. However, the problem gives us a key condition: \( \text{LengthOf}(AB) = \text{LengthOf}(BC) \). This indicates that \( AB = BC \), implying that the legs of the right triangle are equal.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

For a right triangle with equal legs, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle. In such a triangle, if each leg has length \( x \), then by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
x^2 + x^2 = AC^2 \implies 2x^2 = AC^2
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse**

Solving for \( AC \), we have:
\[
AC = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}
\]

**Step 5: Determine Possible Values for \( x \) (or \( y \))**

Given the answer choices (6, 8, 10, 12), we need to find a value of \( x \) such that \( x\sqrt{2} \) is a reasonable length for the hypotenuse.

- If \( x = 6 \), then \( AC = 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.49 \)
- If \( x = 8 \), then \( AC = 8\sqrt{2} \approx 11.31 \)
- If \( x = 10 \), then \( AC = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \)
- If \( x = 12 \), then \( AC = 12\sqrt{2} \approx 16.97 \)

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Hypotenuse with Answer Choices**

The problem does not specify the hypotenuse, but we can infer that the hypotenuse should be a reasonable integer or a value close to an integer. The closest integer value for \( AC \) from the calculated options is when \( x = 8 \), giving \( AC \approx 11.31 \), which is close to 12.

**Step 7: Verify and Select the Closest Answer**

Since \( x = 8 \) gives a hypotenuse close to one of the answer choices, and \( AB = BC = x \), the length \( y \) of each leg is 8.

Final Answer: B

</think>

**Solution**

Given the constraints and calculations, the length \( y \) of each leg \( AB \) and \( BC \) in the isosceles right triangle is 8. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
