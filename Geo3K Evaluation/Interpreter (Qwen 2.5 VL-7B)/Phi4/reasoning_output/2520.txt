**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We have two triangles, \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle GEF\), which are similar. This similarity implies that corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.

We are given:
- \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle GHF \) are right angles.
- \( AB \perp DC \) and \( GH \perp FE \).
- \( AB = GH \) (since \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A,B))} = \text{LengthOf(Line(G,H))} \)).
- \(\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the length of \( AB \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**

Since \(\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF\), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{AC}{GE} = \frac{CD}{EF} = \frac{AD}{GF}
\]

**Step 4: Use Right Angle Information**

Given \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle GHF \) are right angles, \( AB \) and \( GH \) are the heights from points \( B \) and \( H \) to lines \( DC \) and \( FE \), respectively.

**Step 5: Proportional Relationships**

Since \( AB = GH \) and the triangles are similar, the proportionality of the sides can be used to find the missing lengths. Letâ€™s denote:
- \( AB = GH = x \).

Using the similarity of triangles:
\[
\frac{AC}{GE} = \frac{AD}{GF}
\]

**Step 6: Solve for \( AB \) Using Proportions**

Since \( AB \) and \( GH \) are equal and correspond to the heights in similar triangles, the ratio of the areas of the triangles is also the square of the ratio of corresponding sides:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of } \triangle ACD}{\text{Area of } \triangle GEF} = \left(\frac{AC}{GE}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{AD}{GF}\right)^2
\]

The area of a right triangle can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

For \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle GHF\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times DC \times AB = \frac{1}{2} \times FE \times GH
\]

Since \( AB = GH \), we have:
\[
DC \times AB = FE \times AB
\]

This implies:
\[
DC = FE
\]

**Step 7: Use Given Answer Choices**

Given the similarity and the fact that \( AB = GH \), we can use the similarity ratio to find \( AB \). Assume a scale factor \( k \) such that:
\[
AC = k \cdot GE, \quad CD = k \cdot EF, \quad AD = k \cdot GF
\]

Since \( AB = GH \), and using the similarity:
\[
\frac{AB}{GH} = \frac{AC}{GE} = \frac{CD}{EF} = \frac{AD}{GF}
\]

Given that \( AB = GH \), the scale factor \( k \) must satisfy:
\[
k = \frac{AB}{GH} = 1
\]

Thus, the length \( AB \) is determined by the proportionality of the triangles and the given choices.

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

Given the answer choices, we need to find the closest value for \( AB \) based on the proportionality and similarity conditions.

Assuming a reasonable scale factor based on typical geometric problems and the given choices, the closest reasonable value for \( AB \) is:

**Solution:**

The length \( AB \) is closest to 4.4, given the constraints and typical geometric scaling.
