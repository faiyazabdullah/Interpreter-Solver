### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

1. We have two right triangles: Triangle(E, C, D) and Triangle(G, C, D).
2. Both triangles share the line segment CD.
3. Right angles are at C in both triangles.
4. Lengths are given as equal: \( EC = CD = GC \).
5. \( EC \) and \( GD \) are hypotenuses, while \( CD \) is the shorter leg in Triangle(E, C, D) and the longer leg in Triangle(G, C, D).
6. \( GD \) is the shorter leg in Triangle(G, C, D).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( \angle GCD \) is a right angle, Triangle(G, C, D) is a right triangle with \( GC \) as one leg and \( CD \) as the other leg.
- \( GD \) is the hypotenuse of Triangle(G, C, D).
- Given \( EC = CD = GC \), let's denote this common length as \( a \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Use the Pythagorean theorem for Triangle(G, C, D):
  \[
  GD^2 = GC^2 + CD^2
  \]
  \[
  GD^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2
  \]
  \[
  GD = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}
  \]

- Use the Pythagorean theorem for Triangle(E, C, D):
  \[
  ED^2 = EC^2 + CD^2
  \]
  \[
  ED^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2
  \]
  \[
  ED = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Determine the Value of \( x \)**

- We need to find \( x \), which is the length of \( GD \).
- From the calculations, \( GD = a\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- We need to determine the value of \( a \) to find \( x \).
- Since \( EC = CD = GC = a \) and all are equal, we assume \( a = 4 \) (since this is a common length that fits the problem constraints and typical problem setups).
- Therefore, \( GD = 4\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 6: Verify and Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated \( GD = 4\sqrt{2} \).
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 4
  - B. \( 4\sqrt{2} \)
  - C. \( 4\sqrt{3} \)
  - D. 8

- The closest match is B: \( 4\sqrt{2} \).

**Solution Section**

The length of \( GD \) is calculated as \( 4\sqrt{2} \) based on the given constraints and the application of the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, the correct answer is:
