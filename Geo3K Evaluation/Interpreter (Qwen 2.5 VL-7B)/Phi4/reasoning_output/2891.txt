1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \( \odot B \) with center at point \( B \).
   - Points \( C \), \( E \), and \( D \) lie on this circle.
   - Line segment \( CE \) is a chord of the circle and also a diameter (since \( CE \) is given as a diameter).
   - Line segment \( BD \) is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the diameter \( CE \).

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( BD \), which is a radius of the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( CE \) is a diameter, the length of \( CE \) is twice the radius of the circle. Therefore, \( CE = 2r \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - Given \( CE = 13.5 \), we can find the radius \( r \) as follows:
     \[
     2r = 13.5 \implies r = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75
     \]

4. **Verify and Reassess Calculations:**
   - The radius \( BD \) is equal to \( r \) because \( BD \) is a radius of the circle.
   - Therefore, \( BD = 6.75 \).

5. **Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( BD \) is 6.75.
   - Among the answer choices, 6.75 is exactly choice D.

6. **Refine and Confirm:**
   - Double-check the calculations and the logic used. The steps are consistent with the properties of a circle and the given constraints.
   - The perpendicularity of \( BD \) to \( CE \) and the fact that \( BD \) is a radius further confirm the correctness of the calculation.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since the calculated value matches exactly with one of the choices, select D.

</think>

**Solution:**
Given that \( CE \) is the diameter of the circle and \( CE = 13.5 \), the radius \( r \) is calculated as:
\[
r = \frac{CE}{2} = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75
\]
Since \( BD \) is a radius of the circle, \( BD = 6.75 \).

The calculated value matches exactly with choice D.
