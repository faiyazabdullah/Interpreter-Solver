1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a parallelogram WXYZ.
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal: \( WX = YZ \) and \( XY = WZ \).
   - We need to find the length \( x \), which seems to be one of the sides or a diagonal, but it is not explicitly stated which one. We will consider possibilities based on the information given.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to determine the length \( x \) from the given answer choices: 7.5, 10, 12.5, or 15.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal: \( WX = YZ \) and \( XY = WZ \).
   - If \( x \) is a side or diagonal, we can use the properties of parallelograms to find its length.

4. **Explore Possible Scenarios:**
   - If \( x \) is a side:
     - Assume \( x = WX = YZ \) or \( x = XY = WZ \).
   - If \( x \) is a diagonal, use the properties of diagonals in a parallelogram:
     - Diagonals bisect each other, but they are not necessarily equal.
     - Use the formula for diagonals if needed: \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2) \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are diagonals, and \( a \) and \( b \) are sides.

5. **Verify and Calculate:**
   - Without specific numerical values for sides or diagonals, assume \( x \) is one of the sides.
   - If \( x \) is a side, it must satisfy the properties of a parallelogram.
   - Consider \( x \) as a potential side length and check if it fits the properties of a parallelogram.

6. **Reassess and Refine:**
   - Since no specific measurements are given, assume \( x \) is a side.
   - Check if any of the answer choices fit the typical side lengths of a parallelogram.

7. **Reflect and Choose the Closest Answer:**
   - Without additional numerical information, assume \( x \) is a side length.
   - Choose the answer that is a reasonable length for a side of a parallelogram.

<Solution>

Given the constraints and typical properties of a parallelogram, and without specific numerical values for sides or diagonals, we assume \( x \) is a side length. The answer choices are 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15. 

Since no specific measurements are provided, we consider \( x \) as a potential side length. Among the choices, 10 is a common and reasonable length for a side of a parallelogram, fitting typical geometric scenarios.
