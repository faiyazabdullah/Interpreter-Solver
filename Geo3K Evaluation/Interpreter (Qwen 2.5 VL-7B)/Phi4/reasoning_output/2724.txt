**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

We are given that triangles \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \) are congruent. Congruence implies that all corresponding sides and angles of the triangles are equal. The constraints confirm the following equalities:

- \( LM = QS \)
- \( MN = RS \)
- \( LN = QR \)
- \( \angle LMN = \angle QSR \)
- \( \angle MLN = \angle RQS \)
- \( \angle NLM = \angle SQR \)

**Step 2: Understand the Task**

The task is to find \( x \). However, there is no explicit mention of \( x \) in the constraints. Therefore, \( x \) must be implicitly defined through the congruence of the triangles.

**Step 3: Summarize Relevant Findings**

Since \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \), all corresponding sides and angles are equal. This means:

- \( LM = QS \)
- \( MN = RS \)
- \( LN = QR \)
- \( \angle LMN = \angle QSR \)
- \( \angle MLN = \angle RQS \)
- \( \angle NLM = \angle SQR \)

**Step 4: Explore New Ideas**

Given the congruence, the problem might involve finding a specific measure or length that is represented by \( x \). Since no specific \( x \) is mentioned, it could be a measure of a side or angle.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine**

Since all corresponding sides and angles are equal, \( x \) could be any of these measures. However, without additional context, we assume \( x \) refers to one of the side lengths or angles.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**

Reassess the problem to ensure no detail was overlooked. The problem states \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \), so all corresponding parts are equal.

**Step 7: Iteration and Conclusion**

Given the congruence and the answer choices, \( x \) is likely a specific measure of a side or angle. Since no specific measure is given, we assume \( x \) is one of the side lengths or angles, and we need to match it with the closest answer choice.

**Step 8: Consider the Answer Choices**

The answer choices are numerical values: 10, 20, 40, 50. Without specific numerical values for sides or angles, we assume \( x \) is a side length or angle measure that fits one of these choices.

**Final Step: Select the Closest Answer**

Since all sides and angles are equal, and without specific numerical values, we assume \( x \) is a typical measure that could fit one of the choices. Given the symmetry and typical measures in congruent triangles, a reasonable assumption is that \( x \) is a common measure like a side length or angle measure.

**Solution Section**

Since the problem does not specify which side or angle \( x \) refers to, and given the congruence, we assume \( x \) is a typical measure. The problem likely implies \( x \) is a side length or angle measure that fits one of the given choices. Without loss of generality, and considering typical congruent triangle measures, \( x \) is likely a side length or angle measure that fits one of the choices.

Given the lack of specific numerical values, we select the most reasonable choice based on typical congruent triangle measures. The closest and most reasonable assumption is that \( x \) is a side length or angle measure that fits one of the choices.
