**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot U\).
- All sides of the pentagon are equal, and it is regular, meaning all internal angles are equal.

**Step 2: Understand What Needs to be Found**
- We need to find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{QR}\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(PQRST\) is a regular pentagon, it is inscribed in the circle, meaning each vertex of the pentagon lies on the circle.
- The circle is divided into 5 equal arcs by the vertices of the pentagon.
- The total measure of a circle is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Each Arc**
- Since the pentagon is regular, each arc between consecutive vertices (e.g., \(\widehat{PQ}\), \(\widehat{QR}\), etc.) is equal.
- Therefore, the measure of each arc is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

**Step 5: Verify the Calculations**
- The calculation of \(72^\circ\) for each arc is consistent with the properties of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is \(72^\circ\).
- The answer choices are: A. 36, B. 72, C. 120, D. 144.
- The calculated result \(72^\circ\) matches choice B.

**Step 7: Conclusion**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is choice B.

**Solution:**

To find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{QR}\) in a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, we recognize that the circle is divided into 5 equal arcs by the vertices of the pentagon. Each arc measures \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is \(72^\circ\), which corresponds to choice B.

Final Answer: B
