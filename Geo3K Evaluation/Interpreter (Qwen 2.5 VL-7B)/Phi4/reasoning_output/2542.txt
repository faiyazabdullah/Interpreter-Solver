### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Problem Statement:**
   - We are given two parallelograms: ABCD and QQPQ.
   - Point Q is common, and we need to find the scale factor from Q to Q'.
   - There is a scale factor of QC to QC mentioned, implying a transformation involving these points.

2. **Understanding Geometric Constraints:**
   - Parallelogram ABCD with a right angle at B implies ABCD is a rectangle.
   - Parallelogram QQPQ with a right angle at P indicates it is a rectangle as well.
   - Line QQ is parallel to line PC, suggesting a transformation involving scaling.

3. **Identifying the Objective:**
   - We need to determine the scale factor from Q to Q', which implies a transformation of point Q to a new position Q' due to scaling.

4. **Applying Geometric Properties:**
   - Since QQPQ is a rectangle, and there is a right angle at P, QP is perpendicular to PQ.
   - The scale factor of QC to QC suggests a uniform scaling transformation applied to the entire figure.

5. **Exploring the Scale Factor:**
   - The scale factor from Q to Q' involves understanding how the distance QC is transformed.
   - Given the scale factor of QC to QC, we need to determine how this affects the position of Q.

6. **Calculating the Scale Factor:**
   - Since the scale factor is applied uniformly, and QP is perpendicular to PQ, the transformation affects all points equally.
   - The problem implies a direct scaling of the rectangle QQPQ, affecting the distance QC.

7. **Verifying and Refining:**
   - The scale factor of QC to QC implies a multiplication factor applied to the distance from Q to C.
   - Since no specific numerical values are given, we infer the scale factor from the problem's context.

8. **Revisiting and Iterating:**
   - The problem's constraints and the scale factor of QC to QC suggest a simple integer scale factor.
   - Given the choices, we need to select the closest integer that fits the transformation described.

### Solution

1. **Understanding the Scale Factor:**
   - The scale factor of QC to QC implies a multiplication factor applied to the distance QC.
   - Since QQPQ is a rectangle and the transformation is uniform, the scale factor affects all dimensions equally.

2. **Determining the Scale Factor:**
   - The problem suggests a straightforward scaling transformation.
   - Given the choices (2, 3, 4, 5), we need to select the most reasonable integer scale factor.

3. **Selecting the Closest Option:**
   - Without specific numerical values, we infer the scale factor from the context.
   - The problem implies a simple integer scale factor, and the most reasonable choice given the context is 2.
