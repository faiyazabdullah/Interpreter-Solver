1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle \(WXYZ\).
   - The angles \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are all right angles, so each measures \(90^\circ\).
   - The problem introduces \(\angle 1\) with a measure of \(30^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle 2\).

2. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, it has opposite sides that are parallel and equal, and all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).
   - The problem states that \(\angle 1\) measures \(30^\circ\). This angle is likely formed by a diagonal or a line intersecting at one of the rectangle's vertices.
   - The diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
   - The sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).

3. **Exploring Possible Configurations:**
   - If \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is formed by a diagonal intersecting a side, then \(\angle 2\) could be the adjacent angle formed by the same diagonal.
   - In a rectangle, diagonals create two congruent triangles. If \(\angle 1\) is part of one of these triangles, the angles in the triangle must sum to \(180^\circ\).

4. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - Consider the diagonal \(WY\) (or \(XZ\)) intersecting at point \(O\) (the center of the rectangle).
   - \(\triangle WOX\) is a right triangle with \(\angle WOX = 90^\circ\).
   - If \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is one of the angles in \(\triangle WOX\), then the other non-right angle, \(\angle 2\), must satisfy:
     \[
     \angle 1 + \angle 2 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     30^\circ + \angle 2 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Check if \(\angle 2 = 60^\circ\) fits the geometric constraints.
   - The calculation is consistent with the properties of a rectangle and the sum of angles in a triangle.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(60^\circ\).
   - Compare with answer choices: \(A. 30\), \(B. 60\), \(C. 90\), \(D. 120\).
   - The correct choice is \(B. 60\).

Solution:
- Given the constraints and calculations, the measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(60^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice is \(B. 60\).
