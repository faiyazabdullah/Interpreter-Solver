1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle, denoted as Circle(A), with a given radius, RadiusOf(Circle(A)).
   - A regular hexagon, Hexagon(A,E,F,C), is inscribed in this circle. This means all vertices of the hexagon lie on the circle.
   - We are given the area of the circle, AreaOf(Circle(A)).
   - We need to find the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and the inscribed regular hexagon.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The area of the shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the inscribed hexagon.

3. **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle.
   - The area of a circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - The area of a regular hexagon with side length \( s \) is given by \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \).

4. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Let \( r \) be the radius of Circle(A). Then, the side length of Hexagon(A,E,F,C) is also \( r \).
   - The area of Circle(A) is given as \( \pi r^2 \).
   - The area of Hexagon(A,E,F,C) is \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2 \).

5. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region:**
   - Area of the shaded region = Area of Circle(A) - Area of Hexagon(A,E,F,C).
   - Substitute the formulas: 
     \[
     \text{Area of shaded region} = \pi r^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2
     \]
   - Factor out \( r^2 \):
     \[
     \text{Area of shaded region} = r^2 \left( \pi - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)
     \]

6. **Use Given Area of Circle to Find \( r^2 \):**
   - Let the given area of the circle be \( \pi r^2 = \text{AreaOf(Circle(A))} \).
   - Solve for \( r^2 \):
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{\text{AreaOf(Circle(A))}}{\pi}
     \]

7. **Substitute \( r^2 \) into the Shaded Area Formula:**
   - Substitute \( r^2 \) into the shaded area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of shaded region} = \frac{\text{AreaOf(Circle(A))}}{\pi} \left( \pi - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)
     \]

8. **Calculate Numerically:**
   - Assume the given area of the circle is a specific value, say \( \text{AreaOf(Circle(A))} = 314.2 \) (since this is one of the answer choices and a common area for a circle with radius 10).
   - Calculate:
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{314.2}{\pi} \approx 100
     \]
   - Substitute back:
     \[
     \text{Area of shaded region} = 100 \left( \pi - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)
     \]
   - Approximate values:
     \[
     \pi \approx 3.1416, \quad \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.598
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \text{Area of shaded region} = 100 \times (3.1416 - 2.598) \approx 100 \times 0.5436 = 54.36
     \]

9. **Reassess and Compare:**
   - The calculated area of the shaded region is approximately 54.36.
   - Compare with the given choices: A. 76.4, B. 237.8, C. 266.6, D. 314.2.
   - The closest value to 54.36 is 76.4.

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and comparisons, the closest answer choice to the calculated area of the shaded region is 76.4. Therefore, the correct answer is:
