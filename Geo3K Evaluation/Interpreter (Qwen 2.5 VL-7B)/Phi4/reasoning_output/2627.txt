### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints
- We have a circle with center \( B \).
- Points \( R \) and \( T \) lie on the circle, making them endpoints of radii \( BR \) and \( BT \).
- There are two angles, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \), with \( \angle 1 \) having vertex at \( B \) and \( \angle 2 \) being bisected by a line through \( B \).
- The sum of the measures of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) equals the measure of an angle at point \( P \), where \( P \) is a point on the circle.
- The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is half the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings
- We know \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are related by \( \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle 1 \).
- The sum of the measures of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) equals the measure of an angle at point \( P \), which is on the circle.

### Step 3: Brainstorm and Apply Geometric Theorems
- Since \( R \) and \( T \) are on the circle and \( BR \) and \( BT \) are radii, \( \angle RBT \) is a central angle.
- The angle at point \( P \) on the circle could be an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as \( \angle RBT \).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.

### Step 4: Set Up Equations
- Let \( \text{Measure of } \angle 1 = 2x \).
- Then, \( \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = x \).
- The sum of the measures of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) is \( 2x + x = 3x \).
- This sum equals the measure of the inscribed angle at \( P \), which is half of the central angle \( \angle RBT \).
- Therefore, \( \angle RBT = 2 \times 3x = 6x \).

### Step 5: Verify and Refine
- Since \( \angle RBT \) is a central angle, it must be less than or equal to \( 360^\circ \).
- The maximum possible value for \( 6x \) is \( 360^\circ \), so \( x \leq 60 \).
- Given the answer choices, we need to find a feasible \( x \).

### Step 6: Calculate and Compare
- If \( 6x = 180^\circ \) (a reasonable central angle for a circle), then \( x = 30^\circ \).
- Check if \( x = 30^\circ \) satisfies all conditions:
  - \( \angle 1 = 2x = 60^\circ \)
  - \( \angle 2 = x = 30^\circ \)
  - Sum \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ \)
  - Inscribed angle at \( P \) is \( 90^\circ \), consistent with \( \angle RBT = 180^\circ \).

### Step 7: Finalize the Solution
- The calculations confirm \( x = 30^\circ \) is consistent with all given constraints and theorems.
- The closest answer choice to \( x = 30^\circ \) is option A.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the value of \( x \) that satisfies all conditions is \( 30^\circ \).
