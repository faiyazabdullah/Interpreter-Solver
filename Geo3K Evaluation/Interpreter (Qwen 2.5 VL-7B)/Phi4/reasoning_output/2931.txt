### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a parallelogram \(AFGJ\).
- Key properties of a parallelogram include opposite sides being equal and parallel.
- We are given several equal lengths:
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(AF) = \text{LengthOf}(GJ) \)
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(AG) = \text{LengthOf}(FH) \)
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(AF) = \text{LengthOf}(FG) = \text{LengthOf}(GJ) = \text{LengthOf}(JF) \)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- The problem asks to find \( w \), but \( w \) is not directly mentioned in the given constraints.
- We need to deduce what \( w \) represents in the context of the parallelogram using the given equalities.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(AFGJ\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal: \(AF = GJ\) and \(FG = AJ\).
- The given equalities suggest that \(AF = FG = GJ = JF\), implying that all sides of the parallelogram are equal.
- This makes \(AFGJ\) a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal).

**Step 4: Consider the Implications of a Rhombus**
- In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- The diagonals of a rhombus are not equal but bisect each other perpendicularly.

**Step 5: Reassess the Given Equalities**
- The equality \( \text{LengthOf}(AG) = \text{LengthOf}(FH) \) suggests that \(H\) is a point on diagonal \(AG\).
- Since \(AG\) is a diagonal of the rhombus, it bisects the rhombus into two congruent triangles.

**Step 6: Reflect on the Role of \(w\)**
- The problem does not explicitly define \(w\), but given the context, \(w\) likely relates to a specific measurement or property derived from the rhombus.
- The equalities suggest a symmetry that might relate to the diagonals or angles.

**Step 7: Explore Possible Values for \(w\)**
- Given the symmetry and equal lengths, \(w\) could represent a length related to the diagonals or a specific angle.
- Since all sides are equal, the diagonals can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem if needed.

**Step 8: Calculate Using Known Properties**
- If \(AF = FG = GJ = JF = s\), then the diagonals can be calculated using:
  \[
  d_1 = \sqrt{2s^2 - 2s^2\cos(90^\circ)} = \sqrt{2}s
  \]
  \[
  d_2 = \sqrt{2s^2 - 2s^2\cos(90^\circ)} = \sqrt{2}s
  \]
- The diagonals are equal in a square, but in a rhombus, they are not equal unless it is a square.

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**
- Given the symmetry and equalities, \(w\) could be a simple integer related to the side length or a diagonal.
- The answer choices are integers: 3, 4, 5, 13.

**Step 10: Final Consideration**
- Since all sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other, \(w\) could be related to the side length or a simple property like the number of equal sides.
- The simplest interpretation is that \(w\) represents the number of equal sides, which is 4.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis, \(w\) represents the number of equal sides in the rhombus, which is 4.
