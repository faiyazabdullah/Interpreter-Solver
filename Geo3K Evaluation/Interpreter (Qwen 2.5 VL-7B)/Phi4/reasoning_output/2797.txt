**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a triangle with points L, R, and T. The line segments LR and RT are defined with lengths 5 and 9, respectively.
- There is another line segment WS with a length of 6. We need to find the distance RW, but there is no direct information connecting W and R in the context of the triangle.

**Step 2: Summarize the Known Data**
- \( R L = 5 \)
- \( R T = 9 \)
- \( W S = 6 \)
- We need to find \( R W \).

**Step 3: Consider Possible Geometric Relationships**
- Since W and S are not part of the triangle, they could be external points. We don't have direct information about their position relative to R, L, or T.
- We can consider the possibility of using the triangle inequality or other geometric properties, but without additional constraints or coordinates, this is speculative.

**Step 4: Explore Potential Geometric Configurations**
- One possible configuration is that W and S are collinear with R, forming a straight line. In this case, WS could be a part of a line extending from R.
- If W is on the line extending from R through S, then RW could be either 6 (if W is between R and S) or 6 + 5 = 11 (if W is beyond S).

**Step 5: Reassess the Problem Constraints**
- Since we need to choose the closest answer, we should consider if RW could be less than 6, which would imply W is between R and S.
- If W is between R and S, then RW could be less than 6.

**Step 6: Calculate Possible Values for RW**
- If W is between R and S, then RW could be any value from 0 to 6.
- The closest possible values to the given choices are 5.4, 6, 6.6, and 7.5.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- Among the choices, 5.4 is the only value less than 6, which fits the scenario where W is between R and S.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the analysis, the most plausible value for RW, given the constraints and answer choices, is 5.4.

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and the need to select the closest answer, the most reasonable assumption is that W is between R and S, making RW less than 6. Therefore, the closest answer choice is 5.4.
