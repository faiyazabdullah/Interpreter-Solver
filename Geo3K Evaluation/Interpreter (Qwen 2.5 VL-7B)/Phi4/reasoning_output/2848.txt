**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have two lines given by their equations:
  - Line(A, B): \( y = 12 - 3y \)
  - Line(C, D): \( y = 16 - 5y \)
- We need to find the intersection point of these two lines, which is point E.

**Step 2: Identify the Objective**
- The task is to find the value of \( y \) at the intersection of these two lines.

**Step 3: Set Up the Equations**
- For the lines to intersect, their \( y \)-values must be equal at the intersection point.
- Therefore, set the equations equal to each other:
  \[
  12 - 3y = 16 - 5y
  \]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( y \):
  \[
  12 - 3y = 16 - 5y
  \]
  - Add \( 5y \) to both sides:
    \[
    12 + 2y = 16
    \]
  - Subtract 12 from both sides:
    \[
    2y = 4
    \]
  - Divide by 2:
    \[
    y = 2
    \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- Substitute \( y = 2 \) back into the original line equations to ensure consistency:
  - For Line(A, B): \( y = 12 - 3(2) = 12 - 6 = 6 \)
  - For Line(C, D): \( y = 16 - 5(2) = 16 - 10 = 6 \)
- Both lines give the same \( y \)-value at the intersection, confirming \( y = 2 \) is correct.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( y \) is 2.
- Check the answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 5, D. 6.
- The correct choice is A. 2.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**
- Since the calculated value matches one of the answer choices, select A.
</think>

**Solution:**
- By setting the equations equal and solving for \( y \), we determined that the intersection occurs at \( y = 2 \).
- Verification shows that both lines give the same \( y \)-value at this point, confirming the solution.
- The correct answer choice is A.

Final Answer: A
