### Thought Section

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with specific line relationships and lengths.
   - Lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel (\(AB \parallel CD\)).
   - The lengths of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal (\(AB = CD\)).
   - The lengths of \(AD\) and \(BC\) are also equal (\(AD = BC\)).
   - The length of \(BC\) is given as \(11\).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\).
   - The area is given by the formula for a trapezoid: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Here, \(\text{Base}_1 = AB\), \(\text{Base}_2 = CD\), and both are equal.

3. **Using Given Information:**
   - We know \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC = 11\).
   - The area of the trapezoid is given by the expression:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{\text{Area of Trapezoid}}{\text{Divide}(\text{Multiply}(8, 11))}
     \]
   - Simplifying the denominator: 
     \[
     \text{Divide}(\text{Multiply}(8, 11)) = \frac{88}{1} = 88
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{\text{Area of Trapezoid}}{88}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     \text{Area of Trapezoid} = 88 \times \text{Area}
     \]
   - We need to find the actual area of the trapezoid using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AB + CD) \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Since \(AB = CD\), let \(AB = CD = x\).
   - The formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + x) \times \text{Height} = x \times \text{Height}
     \]

5. **Finding the Height:**
   - Since \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD = BC = 11\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from \(A\) to \(CD\) (or \(B\) to \(CD\)).
   - Let the height be \(h\).
   - In the right triangle, using \(AD = 11\):
     \[
     h^2 + \left(\frac{x - x}{2}\right)^2 = 11^2
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     h^2 = 121 \implies h = \sqrt{121} = 11
     \]

6. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Substitute \(h = 11\) into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = x \times 11
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is:
     \[
     \text{Area of Trapezoid} = 88 \times (x \times 11) = 88 \times 11 \times x
     \]
   - Since \(x\) cancels out, we find:
     \[
     \text{Area of Trapezoid} = 88 \times 11 = 968
     \]

7. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area of the trapezoid is \(968\).
   - We need to find the closest answer choice to the area divided by 88:
     \[
     \frac{968}{88} = 11
     \]
   - The closest answer choice to \(11\) is \(110\).
