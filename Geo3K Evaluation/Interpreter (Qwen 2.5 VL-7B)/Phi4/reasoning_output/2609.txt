**Step 1: Analyze the given information and constraints**
- We have a circle \( \odot M \) with several points defined on or around it.
- Arcs and line segments are specified: Arc(F,L), Arc(H,J), and Arc(HP) with a measure of 65°.
- Lengths of segments \( FL = 24 \) and \( HJ = 48 \) are given.
- The arcs \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal, which means they subtend equal angles at the center of the circle \( M \).
- We need to find \( m \widehat{HJ} \), which is the measure of the arc \( HJ \).

**Step 2: Summarize and interpret relevant geometric properties**
- Since \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal in length, they subtend equal angles at the center of the circle \( M \). Therefore, \( \angle FML = \angle HMJ \).
- \( m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) implies the measure of the arc \( HP \) is 65°.
- We know \( \angle L \) and \( \angle N \) are right angles, but they are not directly related to arcs \( FL \) or \( HJ \).

**Step 3: Apply geometric theorems and properties**
- The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
- Since \( \angle HMJ = \angle FML \) and both arcs are equal, \( m \widehat{FL} = m \widehat{HJ} \).
- Since \( FL = 24 \) and \( HJ = 48 \), the arc \( HJ \) subtends an angle at the center that is twice that of \( FL \) due to its length being twice as long.

**Step 4: Calculate the measure of the arc \( HJ \)**
- Let \( x \) be the measure of the central angle subtended by arc \( FL \).
- Then \( m \widehat{FL} = x \) and \( m \widehat{HJ} = 2x \) because \( HJ = 2 \times FL \).
- Since \( m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \), we can use this information to help find \( x \).

**Step 5: Determine the relationship between arcs**
- The arc \( HP \) is part of the circle, and we know \( m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \).
- If \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal arcs, and \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), then \( HJ \) must subtend an angle that is twice that of \( FL \).
- Therefore, if \( m \widehat{FL} = x \), then \( m \widehat{HJ} = 2x \).

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \)**
- Since \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal arcs, and \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), the angle \( \angle HMJ \) is twice \( \angle FML \).
- We know \( m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) is unrelated directly to \( FL \) or \( HJ \) but helps us understand the circle's division.
- The circle's total is \( 360^\circ \). Since \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal arcs, and \( HJ \) is twice the length, \( m \widehat{HJ} = 2 \times m \widehat{FL} \).

**Step 7: Verify and finalize the calculation**
- Since \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are equal arcs, and \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), the angle \( \angle HMJ \) is twice \( \angle FML \).
- If \( m \widehat{FL} = x \), then \( m \widehat{HJ} = 2x \).
- Given \( m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \), and knowing the circle's total is \( 360^\circ \), we can infer:
  - \( x + 2x = 3x \) is the total measure of arcs \( FL \) and \( HJ \).
  - Since \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), \( m \widehat{HJ} = 2x \).
  - Therefore, \( 2x = 130^\circ \) because \( 3x \) must fit within the circle's \( 360^\circ \) minus any other arcs.

**Step 8: Compare with answer choices**
- The calculated measure \( m \widehat{HJ} = 130^\circ \).
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 65, B. 120, C. 130, D. 155.
- The closest and correct choice is C. 130.

Final Answer: C

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and calculations, the measure of the arc \( HJ \) is \( 130^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
