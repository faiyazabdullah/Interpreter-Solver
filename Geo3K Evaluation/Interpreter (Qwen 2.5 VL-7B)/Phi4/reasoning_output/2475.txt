**Step 1: Analyze the Problem**
- We are given expressions for two angles, \( m \angle 5 \) and \( m \angle 4 \), in terms of \( x \).
- We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Step 2: Identify the Relationship Between the Angles**
- Without additional context, common geometric relationships involving angles could include:
  - Adjacent angles on a straight line sum to 180°.
  - Angles in a triangle sum to 180°.
  - Vertically opposite angles are equal.
- Since no specific geometric figure or relationship is mentioned, let's assume a common scenario: \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary (i.e., they form a linear pair). This is a reasonable assumption in the absence of further information.

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**
- If \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary, then:
  \[
  m \angle 5 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substitute the given expressions:
  \[
  (7x - 5) + (2x + 23) = 180
  \]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  7x - 5 + 2x + 23 = 180
  \]
  \[
  9x + 18 = 180
  \]
- Subtract 18 from both sides:
  \[
  9x = 162
  \]
- Divide by 9:
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- Check the calculations:
  - \( 9x = 162 \) implies \( x = \frac{162}{9} = 18 \).
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( x \) is 18.
- Check the answer choices: A. 5.6, B. 18, C. 20, D. 22.
- The closest match is B. 18.

**Step 7: Conclusion**
- Based on the assumption that \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary, the solution is consistent and matches one of the provided choices.

<Solution>
To solve the problem, we assumed that \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are supplementary, leading to the equation:
\[
(7x - 5) + (2x + 23) = 180
\]
Simplifying this equation, we found:
\[
9x + 18 = 180
\]
\[
9x = 162
\]
\[
x = 18
\]
The calculated value of \( x \) is 18, which matches answer choice B. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
