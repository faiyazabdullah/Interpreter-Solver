**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**

- We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- The angles \( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), and \( \angle C \) are equal. This implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle.
- The lengths \( BC \) and \( AC \) are equal.
- \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, which suggests that \( \triangle ABC \) is also a right triangle. This is possible only if \( \triangle ABC \) is a 45-45-90 triangle, which contradicts the equilateral condition unless interpreted differently.

**Step 2: Reconcile the equilateral and right triangle conditions.**

- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, all sides are equal: \( AB = BC = AC \).
- The condition that \( BC \) is the hypotenuse suggests that \( \triangle ABC \) might be interpreted as two 45-45-90 triangles combined, but this is not possible in a single triangle.
- The only consistent interpretation is that \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by splitting the equilateral triangle along its altitude.

**Step 3: Determine the side length using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle.**

- In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is \( x\sqrt{2} \) if the legs are \( x \).
- Since \( BC \) is the hypotenuse and also a side of the equilateral triangle, let the side length of the equilateral triangle be \( s \).
- Therefore, \( s\sqrt{2} = s \), which implies \( s = x\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 4: Calculate the side length \( x \).**

- Since \( BC = AC \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, \( s = BC = AC \).
- Given \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to \( x \), we have \( s = x\sqrt{2} \).
- Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \).

**Step 5: Use the equilateral triangle properties to find \( s \).**

- In an equilateral triangle, the altitude splits the triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles.
- The altitude \( h \) is given by \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \).
- The hypotenuse \( BC \) of the 45-45-90 triangle is \( s \), so \( s = x\sqrt{2} \).

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \) using the relationship \( s = x\sqrt{2} \).**

- Since \( s = x\sqrt{2} \), and \( s \) is the side of the equilateral triangle, we equate it to the altitude formula for a 30-60-90 triangle:
  \[
  s = \frac{h}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}}
  \]
- Equating \( s = x\sqrt{2} \) and solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x\sqrt{2} = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}}
  \]
- Since \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \), substitute:
  \[
  x\sqrt{2} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s}{\sqrt{3}} = s
  \]
- Therefore, \( x = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \).

**Step 7: Calculate \( x \) using the given conditions.**

- Since \( s = BC \) and \( BC = AC \), and \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs \( x \), we have:
  \[
  s = x\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
- Given \( s = BC = AC \), and \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, assume \( s = 10 \) (a reasonable assumption for calculation):
  \[
  x = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 7.1
  \]

**Step 8: Compare with answer choices.**

- The closest answer choice to \( 7.1 \) is \( 6.5 \).

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the closest value to our calculated \( x \approx 7.1 \) is \( 6.5 \).
