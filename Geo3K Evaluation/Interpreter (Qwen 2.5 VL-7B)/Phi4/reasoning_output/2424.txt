**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We are given a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(A, B, C, D\).
- There are lines \(AB, BC, CD, DA\).
- There are right angles at \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle DCB\).
- We know \(\angle ABC = \angle DCB\), which implies these angles are equal.
- We also have right angles \(\angle GBE\) and \(\angle HBE\) with lines \(GE\) and \(HE\) respectively.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \(ABCD\) is cyclic and \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle DCB\) are right angles, \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters of the circle.
- In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle ABC = \angle DCB = 90^\circ\), \(\angle BAD + \angle BCD = 180^\circ\).
- The fact that \(\angle ABC = \angle DCB\) implies that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- The presence of right angles \(\angle GBE\) and \(\angle HBE\) suggests that \(G, B, E, H\) form a configuration where \(BE\) is a line that bisects the right angle at \(B\).

**Step 3: Explore New Ideas**

- Since \(\angle GBE = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle HBE = 90^\circ\), \(G, B, E, H\) form a configuration where \(BE\) is a line that bisects the right angle at \(B\).
- The angles \(\angle GBE\) and \(\angle HBE\) being right angles suggest that \(G\) and \(H\) are on a circle with diameter \(BE\).

**Step 4: Verify Current Steps**

- Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle DCB = 90^\circ\), \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters.
- The angles \(\angle GBE\) and \(\angle HBE\) being right angles imply that \(G\) and \(H\) lie on a circle with diameter \(BE\).

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**

- Reassess the configuration: \(G, B, E, H\) form a semicircle with \(BE\) as the diameter.
- Since \(\angle GBE = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle HBE = 90^\circ\), \(G\) and \(H\) are endpoints of the semicircle.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**

- Reassess the configuration: \(G, B, E, H\) form a semicircle with \(BE\) as the diameter.
- Since \(\angle GBE = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle HBE = 90^\circ\), \(G\) and \(H\) are endpoints of the semicircle.

**Step 7: Iteration and Conclusion**

- Since \(G, B, E, H\) form a semicircle, \(\angle GBE\) and \(\angle HBE\) are both \(90^\circ\).
- The angle \(\angle BGE\) is the angle subtended by the arc \(GE\) at the circumference of the semicircle.
- In a semicircle, the angle subtended by the diameter is \(90^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle BGE = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\).

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated angle \(\angle BGE = 90^\circ\) does not match any of the given choices directly.
- The closest choice to \(90^\circ\) is \(60^\circ\).

**Final Answer: A**

</think>

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with right angles \(\angle ABC = \angle DCB = 90^\circ\).
2. Recognize that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters of the circle.
3. Identify that \(\angle GBE = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle HBE = 90^\circ\) imply \(G, B, E, H\) form a semicircle with \(BE\) as the diameter.
4. Calculate \(\angle BGE\) as the angle subtended by the arc \(GE\) at the circumference.
5. Determine \(\angle BGE = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\).
6. Compare with answer choices and select the closest: \(60^\circ\).
