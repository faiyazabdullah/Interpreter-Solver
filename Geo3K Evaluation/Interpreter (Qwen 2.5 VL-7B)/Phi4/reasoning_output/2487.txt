**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have three circles: Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K).
- All three circles intersect at a common point, Point(L).
- We are given the length of a line segment, GH, which is 10 units.
- We need to determine the length of FH.

**Step 2: Summarize What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find the length of the line segment FH.
- We need to understand the relationship between points G, H, F, and L.

**Step 3: Explore Relevant Geometric Concepts**

- Since all three circles intersect at point L, point L is a common point on the circumferences of Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K).
- GH = 10 suggests that G and H are points on Circle(G) with L as the intersection point.
- We need to determine the position of F relative to the circles and the given segment GH.

**Step 4: Brainstorm Possible Relationships**

- If GH = 10 and circles intersect at L, H might be another point on Circle(G) such that G and H are endpoints of a diameter or a chord.
- Since we need to find FH, we should consider the relationship between F and the circles.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine Understanding**

- If G and H are endpoints of a diameter of Circle(G), then GL = LH = 5 (since GH = 10).
- If F is also on Circle(G), and if F and H are endpoints of a diameter, then FH would also be 10.
- If F is on another circle (J or K), we need more information about its position.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**

- Given that all circles intersect at L, and without additional constraints, the simplest assumption is that F is also on Circle(G) and forms a similar segment with H.
- If F is on Circle(G) and GH = 10, then FH could also be 10 if F and H are endpoints of a similar segment.

**Step 7: Backtrace and Iterate**

- Re-evaluate if any assumptions were incorrect or if additional geometric properties apply.
- Consider if F could be on another circle, but without loss of generality and additional constraints, assume F is on Circle(G).

**Step 8: Finalize the Solution**

- Given the symmetry and the intersection at L, and assuming no additional constraints, FH is likely to be equal to GH if F and H are symmetrically placed on Circle(G).
- Therefore, FH = 10.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis and geometric properties, the most logical conclusion given the constraints and symmetry is that FH = 10. This assumption holds if F and H are symmetrically placed on Circle(G) with respect to the intersection at L.
