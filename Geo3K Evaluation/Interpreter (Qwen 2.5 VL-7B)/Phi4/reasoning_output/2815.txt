**Thought Section**

1. **Analyze the given constraints:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).
   - The lengths of two sides are given as \( AB = 12 \) and \( BC = 7 \).
   - We need to find the possible range for the third side \( AC \) using the triangle inequality theorem.

2. **Summarize relevant findings:**
   - The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), the following must hold:
     - \( a + b > c \)
     - \( a + c > b \)
     - \( b + c > a \)
   - Applying this to our triangle:
     - \( 12 + 7 > AC \) implies \( AC < 19 \)
     - \( 12 + AC > 7 \) implies \( AC > -5 \) (which is always true since lengths are positive)
     - \( 7 + AC > 12 \) implies \( AC > 5 \)

3. **Determine the range for \( AC \):**
   - Combining the inequalities, we get \( 5 < AC < 19 \).

4. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the triangle is given by:
     \[
     P = AB + BC + AC = 12 + 7 + AC = 19 + AC
     \]
   - Since \( 5 < AC < 19 \), the perimeter \( P \) must satisfy:
     \[
     19 + 5 < P < 19 + 19
     \]
     \[
     24 < P < 38
     \]

5. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - We need to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter:
     - A. 29
     - B. 34
     - C. 37
     - D. 38

6. **Verify each option:**
   - For \( P = 29 \), \( AC = 29 - 19 = 10 \), which is within the range \( 5 < AC < 19 \).
   - For \( P = 34 \), \( AC = 34 - 19 = 15 \), which is within the range \( 5 < AC < 19 \).
   - For \( P = 37 \), \( AC = 37 - 19 = 18 \), which is within the range \( 5 < AC < 19 \).
   - For \( P = 38 \), \( AC = 38 - 19 = 19 \), which is not within the range \( 5 < AC < 19 \).

7. **Reassess and refine:**
   - The calculation confirms that \( P = 38 \) is not possible as it violates the triangle inequality for \( AC \).

8. **Reflect and conclude:**
   - Based on the analysis, the perimeter cannot be 38.

**Solution Section**

- The perimeter of the triangle cannot be 38 because it would require \( AC = 19 \), which violates the triangle inequality \( AC < 19 \).
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
