**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We are given a circle with center \( F \), and points \( A, B, C, D \) lying on the circle.
- Lines \( AB, BC, CA, AD, DF, FC, \) and \( FA \) are defined.
- The angle \( \angle AFB \) needs to be determined.
- It is specified that \( AC \) is the diameter of the circle.

**Step 2: Understand the Implications of the Diameter**

- Since \( AC \) is the diameter, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, any angle subtended by the diameter on the circle is a right angle. Thus, \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

**Step 3: Analyze Given Angle Equalities**

- We have \( \angle AFD = \angle CFD = \angle AFB \).
- This implies that \( \angle AFD, \angle CFD, \) and \( \angle AFB \) are equal.

**Step 4: Consider the Circle's Symmetry and Geometry**

- Since \( AC \) is the diameter, \( F \) is the midpoint of \( AC \).
- The circle is symmetric about the line \( AC \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Total Angle Around Point \( F \)**

- The total angle around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \).
- The angles \( \angle AFD, \angle CFD, \) and \( \angle AFB \) are equal, and there are two more angles \( \angle BFC \) and \( \angle DFE \) (where \( E \) is the point where \( DE \) intersects the circle again, completing the circle).
- Since \( \angle AFD = \angle CFD = \angle AFB \), let each of these angles be \( x \).

**Step 6: Set Up the Equation**

- The angles around \( F \) are \( \angle AFB + \angle BFC + \angle CFD + \angle DFE + \angle EFA = 360^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle AFB = \angle CFD = \angle AFD = x \), and \( \angle BFC + \angle DFE = 180^\circ \) (as they are supplementary angles in the semicircle), we have:
  \[
  3x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  3x = 180^\circ \implies x = 60^\circ
  \]

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle AFB \) is \( 60^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 72^\circ \).

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

- Based on the calculations and the requirement to choose the closest answer, the correct choice is \( 72^\circ \).

<Solution>

The measure of \( \angle AFB \) is calculated to be \( 60^\circ \). The closest answer choice to \( 60^\circ \) is \( 72^\circ \).
