1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have two triangles, \(\triangle RST\) and \(\triangle ABC\), which are congruent (\(\triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC\)).
   - Congruence of triangles implies that all corresponding sides and angles are equal.
   - The problem provides the equalities between the sides: 
     \[
     \text{Length}(RS) = \text{Length}(AB)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Length}(ST) = \text{Length}(BC)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Length}(RT) = \text{Length}(AC)
     \]

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We are tasked with finding the value of \(x\). However, the problem does not explicitly define what \(x\) represents. Typically, \(x\) would represent one of the side lengths or angles in the problem context.

3. **Interpreting the Problem:**
   - Since the triangles are congruent and all side lengths correspond, \(x\) could potentially be a side length or an angle measure. However, without additional information on which side or angle \(x\) corresponds to, we assume it to be a side length due to the context given.

4. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - The congruence of triangles directly gives us that the corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, if we know one side length in either triangle, we can find the corresponding side in the other triangle.

5. **Exploring the Answer Choices:**
   - The answer choices are numerical values: 8, 10, 13, and 21.
   - Since these are likely to be side lengths (as angles would not typically be given as such discrete numbers), we consider them as potential side lengths.

6. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - Without loss of generality, assume one of the side lengths is \(x\). Since all sides are equal between the triangles, if \(x\) is a side length, it must match one of the given side lengths.
   - We need to determine which of these values (8, 10, 13, 21) could logically be the length of a side in both triangles.

7. **Reassessing the Problem:**
   - Since no specific side lengths are given, we rely on the congruence property and the fact that \(x\) must be a side length that fits the congruence condition.
   - The problem implies a specific value for \(x\) that satisfies the congruence, suggesting it is one of the provided answer choices.

8. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the nature of the problem and typical side lengths in geometric problems, 13 is a common length that often appears in problems involving Pythagorean triples or simple integer side lengths.
   - Without additional specific numerical values for the sides, 13 is a reasonable assumption for \(x\) based on typical geometric configurations.

9. **Final Reflection:**
   - The problem does not provide explicit numerical side lengths, but based on typical geometric problem setups and the given answer choices, 13 is a plausible side length that fits the congruence condition.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the congruence \(\triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC\) and the equality of corresponding sides, \(x\) must be one of the side lengths that satisfy these conditions. Without additional specific numerical values, we select the most plausible side length from the given choices. Based on typical geometric configurations and the answer choices provided, the most reasonable assumption is that \(x = 13\).
