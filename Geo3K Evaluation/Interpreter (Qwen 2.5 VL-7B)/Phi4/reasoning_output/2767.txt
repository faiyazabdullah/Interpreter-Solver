**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have points: A, B, C, D, E.
- We have lines: AB, BE, EB, AE, EA, AD, DA, BD, DB.
- We have angles: ∠ABE, ∠AEB, ∠AED.

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We need to find the value of \( x \).
- The problem doesn't explicitly define \( x \), so we infer that \( x \) is related to one of the angles mentioned.

**Step 3: Explore the Relationships**

- Since lines AB, BE, AE, and AD are mentioned, consider the possibility of a polygon or a set of intersecting lines.
- Angles ∠ABE, ∠AEB, and ∠AED suggest a focus on point E as a vertex.

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Consider the angles around point E. The sum of angles around a point is 360°.
- ∠ABE + ∠AEB + ∠AED + ∠DEB = 360°.

**Step 5: Identify Known Angles**

- We need to find a relationship or additional information to determine the angles.
- Assume ∠ABE and ∠AEB are part of a triangle ABE.
- In triangle ABE, the sum of angles is 180°: ∠ABE + ∠AEB + ∠BAE = 180°.

**Step 6: Consider Possible Configurations**

- If lines AD and BE intersect at E, then ∠AED and ∠DEB are supplementary (since they form a straight line).
- Assume ∠AED = x. Then ∠DEB = 180° - x.

**Step 7: Calculate Using Assumptions**

- Using the sum of angles around point E: ∠ABE + ∠AEB + x + (180° - x) = 360°.
- Simplify: ∠ABE + ∠AEB + 180° = 360°.
- Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠AEB = 180°.

**Step 8: Reassess and Verify**

- Check if any assumptions lead to a specific angle value.
- If ∠AED = x, and we assume a typical geometric configuration, such as a cyclic quadrilateral or intersecting lines, we might infer specific angle values.

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

- Given the constraints and typical geometric configurations, consider common angle measures.
- If ∠AED = x, and assuming a typical configuration where angles are supplementary or complementary, check common angle values.

**Step 10: Final Calculation and Selection**

- Given the answer choices: 65, 132, 163, 180.
- If ∠AED = x and considering typical configurations, 180° is a common result for a straight line or supplementary angles.
- Choose the closest or most reasonable value based on typical geometric configurations.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and typical configurations, we deduced that ∠AED = x could be part of a straight line or supplementary angle scenario. The most reasonable value for x, considering the options and typical geometric configurations, is 180°.
