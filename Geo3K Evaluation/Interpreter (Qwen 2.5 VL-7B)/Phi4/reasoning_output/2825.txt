**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have a circle centered at \( P \) with points \( J, K, L, \) and \( M \) on the circle.
- Line segments \( PJ, PK, PL, \) and \( PM \) are radii of the circle.
- \( JK \) is a chord of the circle with a length of 10.
- \( \widehat{JKL} \) is an angle subtended by the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \) with a measure of 134 degrees.
- We are asked to find \( m \widehat{JL} \), which is the measure of the angle subtended by the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to determine the measure of the angle \( \widehat{JL} \), which is the angle subtended by the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
- The angle \( \widehat{JKL} \) is given as 134 degrees, which is the measure of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \).
- The arc \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \) includes the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JK} \) and the arc \( \overset{\frown}{KL} \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \)**

- The arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \) is the complement of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{KL} \) in the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \).
- Since \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \), the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \) is also 134 degrees.
- The full circle is 360 degrees, so the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \) is the remainder of the circle after subtracting \( \overset{\frown}{JKL} \).

\[
\text{Measure of } \overset{\frown}{JL} = 360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the Measure of Angle \( \widehat{JL} \)**

- The angle \( \widehat{JL} \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( \overset{\frown}{JL} \).
- Therefore, \( m \widehat{JL} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \overset{\frown}{JL} \).

\[
m \widehat{JL} = \frac{1}{2} \times 226^\circ = 113^\circ
\]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( m \widehat{JL} \) is 113 degrees.
- None of the answer choices match exactly, but we must choose the closest one.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest answer choice to 113 degrees is 112 degrees, which is closest to option C (92 degrees) when considering the typical rounding or error margin in such problems.

<Solution>

The measure of the angle \( \widehat{JL} \) is calculated to be 113 degrees. Among the given options, the closest value is 92 degrees.
