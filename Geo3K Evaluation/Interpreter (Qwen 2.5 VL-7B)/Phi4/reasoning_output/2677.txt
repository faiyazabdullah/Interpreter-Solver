**Step 1: Analyze the Question**
- We are given the perimeter of a polygon, which is 60 centimeters.
- We need to find the length of one side of this polygon.
- The question does not specify the number of sides of the polygon.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**
- We need to find the length of one side, given that the perimeter is 60 cm.
- Without knowing the number of sides, we must consider possible scenarios.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- The perimeter \( P \) of a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, each of length \( s \), is given by:
  \[
  P = n \times s
  \]
- Given \( P = 60 \), we have:
  \[
  60 = n \times s
  \]
- We need to find \( s \) for different values of \( n \).

**Step 4: Explore Possible Values of \( n \)**
- Since \( s \) must be a positive integer, \( n \) must be a divisor of 60.
- The divisors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.

**Step 5: Calculate \( s \) for Each Possible \( n \)**
- For \( n = 1 \), \( s = \frac{60}{1} = 60 \)
- For \( n = 2 \), \( s = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \)
- For \( n = 3 \), \( s = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \)
- For \( n = 4 \), \( s = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \)
- For \( n = 5 \), \( s = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \)
- For \( n = 6 \), \( s = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \)
- For \( n = 10 \), \( s = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \)
- For \( n = 12 \), \( s = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \)
- For \( n = 15 \), \( s = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \)
- For \( n = 20 \), \( s = \frac{60}{20} = 3 \)
- For \( n = 30 \), \( s = \frac{60}{30} = 2 \)
- For \( n = 60 \), \( s = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \)

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Results with Answer Choices**
- The possible values for \( s \) are: 60, 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- The answer choices are: A. 12, B. 15, C. 30, D. 60.
- The values that match the answer choices are 12, 15, 30, and 60.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**
- Since multiple values match, we consider the problem context.
- The problem asks for the length of the side of the polygon, without specifying the number of sides.
- A reasonable assumption is that the polygon is not a degenerate one (like a line), so \( n \geq 3 \).
- The smallest reasonable \( n \) that matches an answer choice is \( n = 4 \) with \( s = 15 \).

**Step 8: Verify and Conclude**
- \( n = 4 \) is a common polygon (a square), and \( s = 15 \) is a valid side length.
- Therefore, the most reasonable and closest answer is \( s = 15 \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and exploration of possible values for \( n \) and \( s \), and considering a reasonable assumption about the polygon, the length of the side of the polygon is most likely 15 centimeters. This corresponds to a square, which is a common and reasonable polygon.
