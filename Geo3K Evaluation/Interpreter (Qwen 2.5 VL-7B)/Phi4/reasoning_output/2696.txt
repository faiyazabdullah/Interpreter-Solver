1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We are dealing with a triangle ABC.
   - Points A, B, and C define the vertices of the triangle.
   - The lines AB, BC, and AC represent the sides of the triangle.
   - The lengths of AB, BC, and AC are all equal, indicating that triangle ABC is equilateral, not isosceles as the question states.
   - The equal lengths imply that all sides are the same length.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to determine the length of side AC in triangle ABC.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since all sides of the triangle are equal (AB = BC = AC), this is an equilateral triangle.
   - In an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are 60 degrees.

4. **Consider Possible Lengths:**
   - The problem does not provide specific numerical values for any side length, but it does ask us to choose from the provided options.

5. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - We are given multiple-choice answers: 1.5, 7, 11, and 12.5.
   - Since no specific side length is provided, we must select the most reasonable or closest possible side length from the choices.

6. **Reflect on the Choices:**
   - Among the given options, 1.5 seems too small for a typical geometric problem unless specifically stated.
   - 7, 11, and 12.5 are more plausible side lengths for a triangle in a problem context.
   - Without additional context, the problem might imply a typical side length that fits within a reasonable range for geometric figures.

7. **Reassess and Select the Closest Option:**
   - Without specific constraints or additional information, the choice of side length should be based on typical geometric sizes.
   - 12.5 is a reasonable choice for a side length in a problem context where no specific measurements are given, as it is neither too small nor excessively large.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
</think>
Solution:
- Given that all sides are equal and no specific numerical length is provided, we must choose the most reasonable length from the options.
- Considering typical geometric figures and the absence of specific constraints, 12.5 is a reasonable choice.
- Therefore, the length of AC is most likely 12.5.
