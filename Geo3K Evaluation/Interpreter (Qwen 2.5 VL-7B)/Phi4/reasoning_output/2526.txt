**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We are given that line \(AB \perp BC\). This indicates that \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle.
- A right angle measures 90 degrees.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 2\).
- We are given that \(\angle 2\) is a right angle and that its measure equals the measure of \(\angle 2\). This confirms that \(\angle 2\) is indeed a right angle.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \(\angle 2\) is a right angle, by definition, it measures 90 degrees.

**Step 4: Show Calculations**

- Given: \(\angle 2\) is a right angle.
- Therefore, \(\text{Measure of } \angle 2 = 90^\circ\).

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Given Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 2\) is 90 degrees.
- The answer choices provided are:
  - A. 64
  - B. 68
  - C. 72
  - D. 76

- None of the choices exactly match 90 degrees. We need to select the closest value.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

- Comparing the options, 76 is the closest to 90.

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**

- Reassess the problem constraints and calculations to ensure no errors.
- Confirm that \(\angle 2\) is indeed a right angle and measures 90 degrees.
- The closest option to 90 degrees is 76.

<Solution>

Given the constraints and calculations, \(\angle 2\) is a right angle and measures 90 degrees. Among the provided answer choices, the closest value to 90 degrees is 76 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
