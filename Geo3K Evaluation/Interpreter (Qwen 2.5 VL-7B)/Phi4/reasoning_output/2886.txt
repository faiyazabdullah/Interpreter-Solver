### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze Given Information**
- We are given a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \) are right angles.
- The measures of \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), \(\angle C\), and \(\angle D\) are equal.
- The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- Since \(\angle A\) and \(\angle C\) are right angles, \(\angle A = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\).
- The condition that all angles are equal implies \(\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = \angle D\).

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**
- If all angles are equal and \(\angle A = 90^\circ\), then \(\angle B = \angle C = \angle D = 90^\circ\).
- However, this contradicts the fact that \(\angle A\) and \(\angle C\) are right angles, and the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral must be \(360^\circ\).

**Step 4: Verify and Refine Steps**
- Reassess the condition: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A), MeasureOf(Angle(B), MeasureOf(Angle(C), MeasureOf(Angle(D))".
- This implies that the measures of the angles are equal when considering their complementary parts due to the cyclic nature and right angles.

**Step 5: Revisit Previous Steps**
- Since \(\angle A = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), the sum of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle D\) must be \(180^\circ\) because the total sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 6: Apply Geometric Theorems**
- In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\).

**Step 7: Calculate \(\angle D\)**
- Given \(\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = \angle D\) in terms of their complementary nature:
  - \(\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ\) (since both are \(90^\circ\)).
  - \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\).
- Since \(\angle A = \angle B\) and \(\angle C = \angle D\) in terms of their complementary nature:
  - \(\angle B = \angle D\).
- Let \(\angle B = \angle D = x\).
- Then \(x + x = 180^\circ\), so \(2x = 180^\circ\).
- Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 90^\circ\).

**Step 8: Consider the Closest Answer**
- Since the calculated \(\angle D = 90^\circ\) does not match any given options, we need to consider the closest value.
- The closest option to \(90^\circ\) is \(82^\circ\).

### Solution Section

**Solution**
- Given the constraints and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we determined that \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\).
- With \(\angle A = \angle B\) and \(\angle C = \angle D\) in terms of their complementary nature, we found \(\angle D = 90^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice to \(90^\circ\) is \(82^\circ\).
