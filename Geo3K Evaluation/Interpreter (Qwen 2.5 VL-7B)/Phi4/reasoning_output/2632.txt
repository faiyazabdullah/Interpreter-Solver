**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two similar triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEF\).
- \(BG\) is a median of \(\triangle ABC\), and \(EH\) is a median of \(\triangle DEF\).
- \(BC = 30\), \(BG = 15\), and \(EF = 15\).
- The problem asks for the length of \(EH\).

**Step 2: Understand Similarity Implications**

- Since \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\), corresponding sides are proportional. Thus, \(\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{CA}{FD}\).
- We know \(BC = 30\) and \(EF = 15\), so the ratio of similarity is \(\frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2\).

**Step 3: Apply Properties of Medians in Similar Triangles**

- In similar triangles, medians corresponding to proportional sides are also proportional.
- Therefore, \(\frac{BG}{EH} = \frac{BC}{EF} = 2\).

**Step 4: Calculate \(EH\)**

- Given \(BG = 15\), we use the proportionality: \(\frac{BG}{EH} = 2\).
- Solving for \(EH\), we have \(EH = \frac{BG}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5\).

**Step 5: Verify Calculations**

- The calculations align with the properties of similar triangles and medians.
- \(EH = 7.5\) is consistent with the given similarity ratio.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value \(EH = 7.5\) matches choice A.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is choice A.

**Solution:**

Given the similarity ratio of \(\triangle ABC\) to \(\triangle DEF\) is 2, and the median \(BG\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is 15, the corresponding median \(EH\) of \(\triangle DEF\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{BG}{EH} = 2 \implies EH = \frac{BG}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the length of \(EH\) is 7.5. Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is:
