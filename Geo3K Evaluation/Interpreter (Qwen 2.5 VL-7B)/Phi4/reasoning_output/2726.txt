**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given two triangles, Triangle(L, M, K) and Triangle(X, Y, Z). For Triangle(X, Y, Z), we know the following:
- It is isosceles.
- We need to find the sum of its angles, typically denoted as SumOfAngles(Triangle(X,Y,Z)).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

In any triangle, the sum of the internal angles is always 180 degrees. This is a fundamental property of triangles.

**Step 3: Brainstorm and Apply Geometric Properties**

Since Triangle(X, Y, Z) is isosceles, two of its angles are equal. However, this information does not affect the sum of the angles. The sum of the angles in any triangle remains 180 degrees regardless of the type of triangle (isosceles, equilateral, or scalene).

**Step 4: Verify and Refine**

The problem asks us to find "x," which we interpret as the sum of the angles of Triangle(X, Y, Z). Based on the geometric property that the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we conclude that x = 180.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated sum of the angles is 180. We need to choose the closest answer from the given options: A. 12, B. 16, C. 51, D. 65.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

Among the choices, 65 is the closest to 180.

**Solution:**

Given that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, and considering the provided answer choices, the closest option to 180 is 65.

Final Answer: D
