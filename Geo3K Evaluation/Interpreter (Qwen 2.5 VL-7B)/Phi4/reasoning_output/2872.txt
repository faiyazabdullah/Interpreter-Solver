1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a circle with center at point \( A \).
   - Points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - We have a central angle \( \angle A \) subtended by the arc \( BCD \).
   - We also have an inscribed angle \( \angle ABCD \) subtended by the same arc \( BCD \).
   - We need to find the measure of \( m \angle 1 \), which we assume to be \( \angle ABCD \).

2. **Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

3. **Given Information:**
   - We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ABCD \).
   - The problem mentions dividing the measure of the central angle, implying that the measure of the inscribed angle is half of the central angle.

4. **Formulating the Solution:**
   - Let \( \text{Measure of Central Angle } (A, B, C, D) = x \).
   - Then, \( \text{Measure of Inscribed Angle } (A, B, C, D) = \frac{x}{2} \).

5. **Exploration:**
   - We need to determine \( x \) or \( \frac{x}{2} \) based on the given answer choices.
   - The answer choices are 54.5, 90, 109, and 218.

6. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - If \( \frac{x}{2} = 54.5 \), then \( x = 109 \).
   - If \( \frac{x}{2} = 90 \), then \( x = 180 \).
   - If \( \frac{x}{2} = 109 \), then \( x = 218 \).
   - If \( \frac{x}{2} = 218 \), then \( x = 436 \), which is not possible for a circle since the maximum measure of a central angle is 360 degrees.

7. **Verification:**
   - The only feasible scenario within the constraints of a circle is when \( \frac{x}{2} = 109 \) and \( x = 218 \).
   - This matches the geometric property that the inscribed angle is half of the central angle.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \( m \angle 1 \), which is the inscribed angle, is 109 degrees.

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis, the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ABCD \) is half of the central angle \( \angle A \) subtended by the same arc. Given the answer choices and the constraints of a circle, the only feasible solution is when the inscribed angle measures 109 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C. 109
