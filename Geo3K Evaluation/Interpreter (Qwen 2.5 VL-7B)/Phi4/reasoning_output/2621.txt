**Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement**
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle STU \) with points \( S, T, U \).
- The constraints specify that \( \text{LengthOf(Line(S,T))} = \text{LengthOf(Line(T,U))} = \text{LengthOf(Line(S,U))} \). This indicates that \( \triangle STU \) is an equilateral triangle.

**Step 2: Summarize Findings**
- In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.
- We need to find the length \( ST \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- In an equilateral triangle, if the side length is \( x \), then all sides are \( x \).
- There are no additional constraints or specific measurements given about the triangle's size or coordinate positions.

**Step 4: Brainstorm Possible Scenarios**
- The problem does not provide any specific numerical values for the side lengths.
- We are given multiple-choice options, which implies that the solution involves picking one of these as the side length.

**Step 5: Verify and Refine Steps**
- Since no further information is provided, and the problem is a multiple-choice question, we assume the problem expects us to select the closest logical option based on typical side lengths of an equilateral triangle.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**
- The problem does not provide any additional context or constraints that could help determine a specific numerical value for \( ST \).
- The multiple-choice answers are: A. 7, B. 12, C. 19, D. 24.
- Without additional information, we assume the problem is testing recognition of equilateral triangle properties and the ability to choose a reasonable side length from given options.

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- Since all sides are equal and there is no further information, we select the most reasonable side length for a generic equilateral triangle from the given options.
- Typically, side lengths like 7, 12, 19, and 24 are arbitrary without additional context, but 12 is a common choice for simple geometric problems.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the analysis and typical problem-solving strategies, we select option B. 12 as the most reasonable choice for the side length of an equilateral triangle given no additional constraints.

<Solution>
Given that \( \triangle STU \) is an equilateral triangle with all sides equal, and no specific measurements are provided, we must select a reasonable side length from the given options. The options are A. 7, B. 12, C. 19, D. 24. Without additional context, 12 is a common and reasonable choice for such problems. Therefore, the length \( ST \) is most likely 12.

Final Answer: B
