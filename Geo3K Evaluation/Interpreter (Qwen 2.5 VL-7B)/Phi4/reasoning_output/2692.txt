**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a triangle \( \triangle WEF \) with points \( W \), \( E \), and \( F \).
- The line segments \( \overline{WE} \), \( \overline{EF} \), and \( \overline{WF} \) are given.
- It is stated that \( \triangle WEF \) is congruent.
- The lengths \( \overline{WF} \) and \( \overline{EF} \) are equal.

**Step 2: Understand the Question**
- We need to find the value of \( x \), which is likely related to the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( \triangle WEF \) is congruent, and \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \), it suggests that \( \triangle WEF \) might be isosceles with \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \).
- The congruence of the triangle implies that all corresponding sides and angles are equal.

**Step 4: Consider Possible Scenarios**
- If \( \triangle WEF \) is equilateral, then all sides are equal, and \( \overline{WE} = \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \).
- If \( \triangle WEF \) is isosceles with \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \), then \( \overline{WE} \) could be different.

**Step 5: Use Given Lengths and Equations**
- Let \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} = x \).
- We need to find \( x \) given the possible answer choices.

**Step 6: Evaluate the Answer Choices**
- The answer choices are \( A. 3.5 \), \( B. 7 \), \( C. 10.5 \), \( D. 21 \).
- Since \( \triangle WEF \) is congruent and \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \), \( x \) must be a reasonable length for both \( \overline{WF} \) and \( \overline{EF} \).

**Step 7: Consider Practical Lengths**
- If \( \triangle WEF \) is equilateral, all sides are equal, and \( x \) should be a common length.
- The most straightforward assumption is that \( x \) is a whole number or a simple fraction.

**Step 8: Verify and Compare**
- Since \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} \), and no additional information is given about \( \overline{WE} \), we assume \( x \) is the length of the equal sides.
- The simplest and most symmetric choice for an equilateral triangle is \( x = 7 \), as it is a whole number and fits the pattern of typical geometric problems.

**Step 9: Reassess and Conclude**
- Given the symmetry and typical geometric problem setups, \( x = 7 \) is a logical choice.
- There is no additional information to suggest a different value for \( x \).

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis, the most reasonable assumption is that \( \triangle WEF \) is equilateral or at least isosceles with \( \overline{WF} = \overline{EF} = x \). The simplest and most symmetric choice for \( x \) is 7, which fits the typical geometric problem setup and the given answer choices.
