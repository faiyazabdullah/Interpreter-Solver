**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**

- We have a triangle XYZ with points X, Y, and Z.
- Lines XY, YZ, and XZ are sides of the triangle.
- There is another line d that intersects one of these sides (though the exact intersection point is not specified).
- Angles are defined as follows:
  - Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at point Y.
  - Angle(Y,Z,1) is an angle formed by extending line YZ to a point 1.
  - Angle(Z,X,3) is an angle formed by extending line ZX to a point 3.
  - Angle(X,Z,2) is an angle formed by extending line XZ to a point 2.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**

- We need to determine which fact would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**

- A key theorem for parallel lines is the Corresponding Angles Postulate: If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.
- Another relevant theorem is the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem: If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.

**Step 4: Analyze each answer choice.**

- **Choice A: \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\)**
  - \(\angle 1\) is an exterior angle at point Y, and \(\angle 3\) is an exterior angle at point Z.
  - If \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\), this suggests that line d is parallel to line XZ because these could be alternate interior angles formed by the transversal line d intersecting lines YZ and ZX.

- **Choice B: \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\)**
  - \(\angle Z\) is the interior angle at point Z of triangle XYZ.
  - This congruence does not directly relate to line d being parallel to line XZ.

- **Choice C: \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\)**
  - \(\angle X\) is the interior angle at point X of triangle XYZ.
  - This congruence does not directly relate to line d being parallel to line XZ.

- **Choice D: \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\)**
  - \(\angle 3\) is an exterior angle at point Z, and \(\angle Z\) is the interior angle at point Z.
  - This congruence does not directly relate to line d being parallel to line XZ.

**Step 5: Verify and refine the analysis.**

- The only choice that directly relates to the conditions for parallel lines using the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem is Choice A: \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\).
- This choice implies that line d is parallel to line XZ because \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) would be alternate interior angles.

**Step 6: Reassess and conclude.**

- After considering all choices and applying geometric theorems, Choice A is the only one that provides sufficient information to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.
</think>

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis, the fact that \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\) is sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ, as it satisfies the condition for alternate interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines.
