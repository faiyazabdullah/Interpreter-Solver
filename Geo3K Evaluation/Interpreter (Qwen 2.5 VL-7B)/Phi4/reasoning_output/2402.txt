1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle with center \( O \) and radius \( OB = 13 \) inches.
   - Chord \( CD \) is 24 inches long.
   - \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \), which implies that \( OB \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( CD \).

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( OX \), where \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \).

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \) and bisects it, \( CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) inches.
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle OXC \) with:
     - \( OC = 13 \) inches (radius),
     - \( CX = 12 \) inches (half of the chord).

4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In right triangle \( \triangle OXC \), apply the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2
     \]
     \[
     13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
     \]
     \[
     169 = OX^2 + 144
     \]
     \[
     OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25
     \]
     \[
     OX = \sqrt{25} = 5
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( OX \) is 5 inches.
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 5, B. 12, C. 13, D. 26.
   - The correct choice is A. 5.

6. **Verify the Steps:**
   - Reassess the calculations and logical steps to ensure no errors were made.
   - The application of the Pythagorean theorem is correct, and the calculations are accurate.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of \( OX \) is indeed 5 inches, matching choice A.
</think>

**Solution:**
To solve for \( OX \), we used the properties of a circle and the Pythagorean theorem. Given that \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \) and bisects it, \( CX = 12 \) inches. Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OXC \), we found \( OX = 5 \) inches. Therefore, the correct answer is:
