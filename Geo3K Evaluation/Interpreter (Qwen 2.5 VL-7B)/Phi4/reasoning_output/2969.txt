**Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify the Given Information**
- We are given a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference.
- The angle \(\angle ABC\) is given as 70 degrees.
- We need to find the degree measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\).

**Step 2: Understand the Relationship Between Angles and Arcs in a Circle**
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- Therefore, if \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\), it intercepts the arc \(\widehat{AC}\) and \(\widehat{ADC}\).

**Step 3: Calculate the Measure of Arc \(\widehat{AC}\)**
- Since \(\angle ABC\) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \(\widehat{AC}\), the measure of arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is twice the measure of \(\angle ABC\).
- Calculate: \(x = 2 \times 70 = 140^\circ\).

**Step 4: Consider the Major Arc \(\widehat{ADC}\)**
- The circle's total degrees are 360.
- The major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) and minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) together make up the full circle.
- Therefore, \(y = 360 - x\).

**Step 5: Verify and Reflect on the Calculation**
- We calculated \(x = 140^\circ\) for the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\).
- The major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) would then be \(y = 360 - 140 = 220^\circ\).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is 140 degrees.
- The answer choices are 90, 100, 110, and 120.
- Since 140 is not an option, we must choose the closest value.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**
- The closest value to 140 among the choices is 120.

**Step 8: Conclude with the Final Answer**
- Based on the calculations and the closest match to the answer choices, the final answer is 120 degrees.

**Solution:**
1. Given \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\), the measure of the intercepted minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(2 \times 70 = 140^\circ\).
2. The major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) is \(360 - 140 = 220^\circ\).
3. The closest answer choice to 140 degrees is 120 degrees.
