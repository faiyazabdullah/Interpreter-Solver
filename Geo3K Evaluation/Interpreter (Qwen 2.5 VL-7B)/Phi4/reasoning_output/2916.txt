**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle KJL \).
- Points \( K, J, \) and \( L \) are the vertices of this triangle.
- We are told that \( \text{LengthOf}(KJ) = \text{LengthOf}(JL) \).
- We need to find the length of \( KL \).

**Step 2: Understanding the Problem**
- Given that \( KJ = JL \), triangle \( \triangle KJL \) is isosceles with \( J \) being the vertex where the two equal sides meet.
- Our goal is to find the length of the third side \( KL \).

**Step 3: Applying Relevant Theorems and Properties**
- In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles are equal.
- Since \( KJ = JL \), the angles \( \angle KJL \) and \( \angle JLK \) are equal.

**Step 4: Exploring Possible Scenarios**
- To find \( KL \), we can explore scenarios where additional information might be implicitly assumed, such as specific triangle types or known side lengths.
- Consider the possibility of \( \triangle KJL \) being a special triangle like an equilateral triangle.

**Step 5: Calculating \( KL \)**
- If \( \triangle KJL \) is equilateral, then all sides are equal: \( KJ = JL = KL \).
- Without loss of generality, assume \( KJ = JL = x \).
- In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so \( KL = x \).

**Step 6: Matching with Answer Choices**
- We need to match \( KL \) with one of the given answer choices: 7, 8, 12, 15.
- Since \( KJ = JL \), and assuming \( \triangle KJL \) is equilateral, \( KL \) should also equal \( KJ \) or \( JL \).
- Without specific numerical values for \( KJ \) or \( JL \), we assume a plausible scenario where \( KL \) matches one of the choices.

**Step 7: Selecting the Closest Answer**
- Given the choices, and assuming \( KJ = JL = 7 \) (as a plausible side length for an equilateral triangle), \( KL \) would also be 7.
- Therefore, the closest answer choice is 7.

**Step 8: Final Verification**
- Reassess the logic: \( KJ = JL \) implies \( \triangle KJL \) could be equilateral, making \( KL = KJ = JL \).
- The answer choice that matches this scenario is 7.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the assumption that \( \triangle KJL \) is equilateral (since \( KJ = JL \)), the length of \( KL \) would be equal to \( KJ \) or \( JL \). Assuming a reasonable side length for an equilateral triangle, \( KL = 7 \).
