**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a trapezoid ABCD with AB and CD as the parallel sides.
   - Points S and T are midpoints of the legs AD and BC, respectively.
   - We are given: 
     - \( AB = x + 4 \)
     - \( CD = 3x + 2 \)
     - \( ST = 9 \)
   - We need to find the length of AB.

2. **Understand the Geometric Properties:**
   - In a trapezoid, the segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) is called the midsegment.
   - The length of the midsegment \( ST \) is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides \( AB \) and \( CD \).

3. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**
   - According to the midsegment theorem for trapezoids:
     \[
     ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     9 = \frac{x + 4 + 3x + 2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     18 = 4x + 6
     \]
   - Subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     12 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = 3
     \]

5. **Find the Length of AB:**
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the expression for \( AB \):
     \[
     AB = x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Check if the calculated \( AB \) satisfies the midsegment equation:
     - \( CD = 3x + 2 = 3(3) + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 \)
     - Check the midsegment:
       \[
       ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2} = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
       \]
   - The calculation is consistent with the given \( ST = 9 \).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( AB \) is 7, which matches choice C.

**Solution Section:**

- The length of \( AB \) is calculated to be 7.
- This matches the answer choice C.
