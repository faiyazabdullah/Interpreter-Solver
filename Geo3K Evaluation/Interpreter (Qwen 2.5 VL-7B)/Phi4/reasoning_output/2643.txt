<think>
1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have three right angles: \(\angle ABC\), \(\angle DEF\), and \(\angle GHI\).
   - All these angles are equal in measure.
   - The measure of each angle is equal to the measure of \(\angle(\text{AnotherPoint, AnotherLine})\).

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Each right angle measures 90 degrees. Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \angle DEF = \angle GHI = 90^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle(\text{AnotherPoint, AnotherLine})\) is equal to these angles, it must also be 90 degrees.

3. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\) in the figure. However, the problem does not provide a figure or additional context for \(x\).

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since all given angles are right angles and equal, the problem might involve a geometric figure where these angles are part of a larger configuration.
   - Without a specific figure, we consider common geometric configurations involving right angles, such as rectangles, squares, or triangles.

5. **Consider Possible Configurations:**
   - If these angles are part of a polygon, the sum of angles in a polygon with \(n\) sides is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\).
   - For a quadrilateral, the sum of angles is \(360^\circ\). If three angles are \(90^\circ\), the fourth angle must also be \(90^\circ\) for a rectangle or square.

6. **Reflect on the Problem Statement:**
   - The problem might be abstract, focusing on the equality of angles rather than a specific geometric figure.
   - The value of \(x\) could relate to a property or dimension derived from these angles.

7. **Reassess and Refine:**
   - Without additional context or a figure, assume \(x\) could be a measure related to these angles, such as a side length or a coordinate.
   - Consider common values or relationships in geometric problems involving right angles.

8. **Iterate and Compare:**
   - Since all angles are \(90^\circ\), and no additional information is provided, \(x\) might be a simple numerical value related to these angles.
   - Compare the answer choices: 11, 12, 13, 14. Without further context, assume \(x\) could be a standard measure or a result of a simple calculation.

9. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the lack of specific information, choose the most reasonable or common value associated with right angles or simple geometric properties.

</think>
<Solution>
Given the constraints and the lack of a specific figure, we assume \(x\) is a measure related to the equality of the right angles. Since all angles are \(90^\circ\), and without additional context, we choose the most reasonable value from the answer choices. The value 12 is a common measure in geometric problems involving right angles (e.g., a 3-4-5 triangle scaled up).
