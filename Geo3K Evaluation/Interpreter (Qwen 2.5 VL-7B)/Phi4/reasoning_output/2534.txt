**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with the following properties:
- \(AB \parallel CD\)
- \(AB = BC = DA\)
- \(AB, BC, CD, DA\) are sides of the trapezoid.

**Step 2: Understand the Task**

We need to find the value of \(x\), which is presumably a length or a coordinate related to the trapezoid. However, \(x\) is not directly defined in the problem. We need to deduce its meaning from the context.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**

Given that \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AB = BC = DA\), we can infer that \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid with \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the parallel sides. Since \(AB = BC = DA\), it suggests a symmetric configuration.

**Step 4: Consider the Implications of Equal Lengths**

Since \(AB = BC = DA\), let's denote this common length as \(s\). The trapezoid is isosceles, and the non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are equal.

**Step 5: Use the Properties of Isosceles Trapezoids**

In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal. Therefore, \(AC = BD\).

**Step 6: Set Up Equations**

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\), we can set up equations based on the coordinates of the points if needed. However, without loss of generality, we can assume:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (s, 0)\)
- \(D = (x_1, y_1)\)
- \(C = (x_2, y_1)\)

Given \(AB = BC = DA = s\), we have:
- \(BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - s)^2 + y_1^2} = s\)
- \(CD = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = s\)

**Step 7: Solve for \(x\)**

Since \(AB = BC = DA = s\), and \(AB \parallel CD\), the height from \(B\) or \(A\) to \(CD\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABD\):
- \(BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\theta)\)
- Since \(AB = AD\), \(\theta\) is the angle between \(AB\) and \(AD\).

Using the properties of isosceles trapezoids and symmetry, the height \(h\) from \(B\) or \(A\) to \(CD\) is:
\[ h = \sqrt{s^2 - \left(\frac{CD - AB}{2}\right)^2} \]

Given \(AB = CD\), the height simplifies to:
\[ h = \sqrt{s^2 - 0} = s \]

**Step 8: Determine \(x\)**

Since \(x\) is not explicitly defined, we assume it relates to the length \(CD\) or a coordinate. Given the symmetry and equal lengths, \(x\) could represent the length of the parallel side \(CD\) or a coordinate difference.

Assuming \(x\) represents the length \(CD\), and since \(AB = CD\), we have \(x = s\).

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

The answer choices are numerical values. We need to find which value of \(s\) (or \(x\)) fits the given options. Given the symmetry and equal lengths, we assume \(s\) is one of the choices.

**Step 10: Select the Closest Answer**

Given the symmetry and equal lengths, the most reasonable assumption is that \(x\) is the length of the parallel sides, which is equal to \(s\). The closest value to a typical geometric configuration with equal sides is \(10\).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the properties of the isosceles trapezoid and the equal lengths, the most reasonable assumption is that \(x\) represents the length of the parallel sides \(AB\) and \(CD\). The closest value from the answer choices that fits this configuration is \(10\).
