**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have a rectangle ABCD, with points A, B, C, and D.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA form the sides of the rectangle.
- There are right angles at B and D, i.e., ∠ABC and ∠CDA are 90°.
- Lines AB and CD are parallel (since it's a rectangle), and lines BC and DA are parallel.
- The question is asking us to find x, but there's no direct mention of x in the constraints provided.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- The problem does not explicitly define what x represents. Given the context of a rectangle, x could represent an angle or a side length. However, since the answer choices are numerical values that could represent angles (30, 60, 90, 120), it's logical to assume x refers to an angle.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- In a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles (90°).
- The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°.
- Since ∠ABC and ∠CDA are right angles, they are each 90°.
- The other two angles, ∠BCD and ∠DAB, must also be 90° each to satisfy the properties of a rectangle.

**Step 4: Consider the Possible Interpretation of x**

- Since the problem involves a rectangle and the answer choices are angles, x could be one of the angles in the rectangle.
- Given that all angles in a rectangle are 90°, x could logically be 90°.

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**

- The calculated angle for x, assuming it refers to one of the angles in the rectangle, is 90°.
- Among the answer choices, 90° is listed as option C.

**Step 6: Verify and Reassess**

- Reassessing the problem, there is no additional information or constraints that suggest x is anything other than one of the angles of the rectangle.
- The problem's setup and the answer choices strongly indicate that x is indeed one of the angles of the rectangle.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the analysis, x is most logically 90°, which matches option C.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and properties of a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles, each measuring 90°. Therefore, x, which likely represents one of these angles, is 90°. Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the correct choice is C. 90.

Final Answer: C
