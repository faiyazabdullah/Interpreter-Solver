**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a circle with center \( G \) and radius 26.
- Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Lines \( AG, BG, CG, DG, EG, FG \) are radii of the circle.
- Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \).
- We need to find the length of chord \( AC \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Geometric Properties**
- If two chords are equidistant from the center of a circle, they are equal in length.
- The distance from the center of the circle to a chord is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.
- The formula relating the radius \( r \), the distance \( d \) from the center to the chord, and the half-length \( \frac{c}{2} \) of the chord is given by:
  \[
  r^2 = d^2 + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2
  \]
  where \( c \) is the length of the chord.

**Step 3: Apply the Formula**
- Given \( r = 26 \), we need to find \( c \) for chord \( AC \).
- Since \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center, they have the same perpendicular distance \( d \).
- We need to find \( c \) such that:
  \[
  26^2 = d^2 + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2
  \]
  \[
  676 = d^2 + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2
  \]

**Step 4: Consider Possible Values for \( d \)**
- Since \( d \) is the same for both chords and they are equidistant, we need to find a reasonable \( d \) that allows \( c \) to be a valid chord length.
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( c \):
  \[
  \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2 = 676 - d^2
  \]
  \[
  \frac{c}{2} = \sqrt{676 - d^2}
  \]
  \[
  c = 2\sqrt{676 - d^2}
  \]

**Step 5: Test Possible Values for \( d \)**
- Since \( d \) must be less than 26 (as it is a distance from the center to the chord), let's test some values:
  - If \( d = 0 \), \( c = 2\sqrt{676} = 52 \) (not an option).
  - If \( d = 10 \):
    \[
    c = 2\sqrt{676 - 100} = 2\sqrt{576} = 2 \times 24 = 48
    \]
    - This matches option D.

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**
- Since \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant and \( c = 48 \) is a valid length for both chords when \( d = 10 \), this satisfies all conditions.
- The calculated length of \( AC \) is 48, which matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

**Solution:**
- Using the properties of chords equidistant from the center and the formula for the chord length, we determined that the length of chord \( AC \) is 48 when the perpendicular distance from the center is 10.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
