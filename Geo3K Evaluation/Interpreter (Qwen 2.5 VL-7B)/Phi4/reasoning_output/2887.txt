1. **Understanding the Given Geometric Constraints**:
   - We have a circle centered at \( F \).
   - The lines \( FH \), \( FL \), \( FK \), \( FJ \), \( FG \), and \( KL \) are given.
   - \( \angle FHG \) and \( \angle FHK \) are right angles.
   - \( FH \cong FL \), meaning \( FH = FL \).
   - \( FK = 17 \).
   - \( GH \) and \( KL \) are diameters of the circle.

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find the length \( JG \).

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties**:
   - Since \( GH \) and \( KL \) are diameters, \( GH = 2r \) and \( KL = 2r \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
   - \( FH = FL \) implies both are radii of the circle. Let \( r = FH = FL \).
   - \( FK = 17 \) is another radius, so \( r = 17 \).
   - \( GH \) being a diameter implies \( GH = 2 \times 17 = 34 \).

4. **Analyzing the Right Angles**:
   - \( \angle FHG = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle FHK = 90^\circ \) imply that \( H \) and \( K \) lie on the circle such that \( FH \) and \( FK \) are perpendicular to \( HG \) and \( HK \), respectively.
   - Since \( GH \) is a diameter, \( \angle FGH = 90^\circ \) by the Thales' theorem.

5. **Positioning Points on the Circle**:
   - \( F \) is the center, \( H \) and \( L \) are endpoints of radii perpendicular to \( FG \) and \( FK \).
   - \( G \) and \( H \) are endpoints of the diameter \( GH \).

6. **Finding \( JG \)**:
   - Since \( FJ \) is a line through \( F \), \( J \) could be any point on the circle.
   - To find \( JG \), consider the position of \( J \) on the circle.
   - The maximum distance \( JG \) can be is when \( J \) is directly opposite \( G \) on the circle, which would be the diameter \( GH \), i.e., \( JG = GH = 34 \).
   - However, \( J \) is not specified to be directly opposite \( G \), so \( JG \) must be less than \( 34 \).

7. **Considering the Closest Answer**:
   - Given the options, the closest possible length for \( JG \) that is less than \( 34 \) is \( 17 \), which is half the diameter.

8. **Verification**:
   - \( J \) could be at \( K \) or any point on the circle such that \( JG \) is a radius, which is \( 17 \).

</think>

<Solution>

1. **Determine the Radius**:
   - Since \( FK = 17 \), the radius \( r = 17 \).

2. **Calculate the Diameter**:
   - \( GH = 2r = 34 \).

3. **Evaluate \( JG \)**:
   - \( JG \) can be a radius if \( J \) is on the circle at a point like \( K \).
   - Therefore, \( JG = 17 \).

4. **Select the Closest Answer**:
   - The closest answer choice to \( 17 \) is \( C \).
