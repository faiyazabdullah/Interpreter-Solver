1. **Understanding the Given Information**: We need to find the value of \( x \) such that line \( m \) is parallel to line \( n \). The equation provided is \( 4x - 23 + 2x + 17 = 0 \).

2. **Geometric Interpretation**: For two lines to be parallel, their corresponding angles must be equal. Here, the equation given represents the sum of angles that should be equal, indicating that the lines are parallel when this sum equals zero.

3. **Simplifying the Equation**: Combine like terms in the equation:
   \[
   4x - 23 + 2x + 17 = 0
   \]
   \[
   (4x + 2x) + (-23 + 17) = 0
   \]
   \[
   6x - 6 = 0
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**: Isolate \( x \) by solving the equation:
   \[
   6x - 6 = 0
   \]
   \[
   6x = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 1
   \]

5. **Verification and Comparison**: The calculated value of \( x \) is 1, which does not match any of the provided answer choices (A: 10, B: 20, C: 31, D: 40). This suggests a potential oversight or misinterpretation in the problem setup or solution process.

6. **Re-evaluation**: Reassess the equation and calculations:
   - The equation \( 6x - 6 = 0 \) was derived correctly.
   - The solution \( x = 1 \) is accurate based on the given equation.

7. **Choosing the Closest Answer**: Since \( x = 1 \) does not match any answer choices, we must select the closest value. The smallest value among the choices is 10 (option A).

8. **Final Decision**: Given the constraints and the requirement to choose one of the provided options, the closest value to 1 is 10.

Solution:
- The equation \( 4x - 23 + 2x + 17 = 0 \) simplifies to \( 6x - 6 = 0 \).
- Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 1 \).
- Since \( x = 1 \) is not an option, the closest value is 10.
- Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{A} \).
