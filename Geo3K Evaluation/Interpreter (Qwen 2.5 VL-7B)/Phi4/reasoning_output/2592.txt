1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints**: We are provided with a circle \(A\), a sector \(ABC\) within this circle, and several conditions:
   - Line segments \(AC\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) are all radii of the circle.
   - The angle \( \angle ABC \) is such that the measure is equal to the area of sector \(ABC\).

2. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the sector \(ABC\).

3. **Identifying Key Geometric Properties**:
   - Since \(AC\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) are radii, triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC = BC = r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.
   - The area of sector \(ABC\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
     \]
     where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.

4. **Relating Given Conditions**: We know that the measure of \(\angle ABC\) in degrees is equal to the area of the sector. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ABC\). Then:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
   \]

5. **Solving for \(\theta\)**:
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     \theta \times 360^\circ = \theta \times \pi r^2
     \]
   - Simplify to find:
     \[
     360^\circ = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Solve for \(r^2\):
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{360^\circ}{\pi}
     \]

6. **Calculating the Area of the Sector**:
   - Substitute \(r^2\) back into the sector area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \left(\frac{360^\circ}{\pi}\right)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \text{Area of Sector} = \theta
     \]
   - Since \(\theta\) is the measure of \(\angle ABC\) and also equals the area of the sector, we need to find \(\theta\) such that:
     \[
     \theta = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 360^\circ = \theta
     \]
   - This confirms that \(\theta\) is consistent with the given condition.

7. **Finding the Numerical Value**:
   - From \(r^2 = \frac{360^\circ}{\pi}\), calculate \(r\):
     \[
     r = \sqrt{\frac{360}{\pi}}
     \]
   - Substitute back to find \(\theta\):
     \[
     \theta = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times \frac{360}{\pi} = \theta
     \]
   - Since \(\theta\) is the area, calculate:
     \[
     \theta = \frac{360}{\pi}
     \]
   - Numerically evaluate:
     \[
     \theta \approx \frac{360}{3.14159} \approx 114.59
     \]

8. **Comparing with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated area of the sector is approximately \(114.59\).
   - Compare with the given choices: \(6.5\), \(15.6\), \(22.1\), \(37.7\).
   - The closest value to \(114.59\) is not directly listed, but we must choose the closest possible option.

9. **Selecting the Closest Answer**:
   - Given the discrepancy, re-evaluate the context or possible simplifications.
   - Recognize that the problem might involve a different interpretation or simplification.
   - The closest reasonable choice based on typical problem constraints and simplifications is \(37.7\).

Solution:
- The area of the shaded region, given the constraints and calculations, is closest to option \(D\).
- Final Answer: D
