<think>
1. **Analyze the Question and Given Information**:
   - We are given that quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
   - Given lengths: EF = 4x - 6 and HG = x + 3.
   - We need to find the length of EF.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found**:
   - We need to find the value of EF.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**:
   - Since EFGH is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal: EF = HG.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 4x - 6 = x + 3.

4. **Solve the Equation**:
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for x:
     \[
     4x - 6 = x + 3
     \]
     Subtract x from both sides:
     \[
     3x - 6 = 3
     \]
     Add 6 to both sides:
     \[
     3x = 9
     \]
     Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = 3
     \]

5. **Substitute Back to Find EF**:
   - Substitute x = 3 into the expression for EF:
     \[
     EF = 4x - 6 = 4(3) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6
     \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated length of EF is 6.
   - Compare this with the provided answer choices: A. 6, B. 12, C. 18, D. 20.
   - The calculated result matches choice A.

7. **Verification**:
   - Reassess the calculations: Solving 4x - 6 = x + 3 correctly led to x = 3.
   - Substituting x = 3 into EF = 4x - 6 gave EF = 6, which is consistent with the properties of a rectangle.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The calculations are consistent with the geometric properties and the equation setup.
   - The closest and exact match to the calculated result is option A.
