**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with vertices at points \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
   - The sides of the triangle are \( \overline{RS} \), \( \overline{ST} \), and \( \overline{RT} \).
   - It is given that \( \text{Length}(\overline{RS}) = \text{Length}(\overline{ST}) = \text{Length}(\overline{RT}) \).

2. **Summarize the Relevant Findings:**
   - Since all sides of the triangle are equal, \( \triangle RST \) is an equilateral triangle.

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The problem asks us to find \( z \), but does not specify what \( z \) represents. Given the context, \( z \) likely refers to a common property of equilateral triangles, such as a side length or an angle.

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all interior angles are \( 60^\circ \).
   - The problem does not provide specific numerical values for the side lengths, so we assume \( z \) refers to the side length.

5. **Explore Possible Values for \( z \):**
   - Since the problem provides answer choices (7, 9, 12, 15), we assume \( z \) is the side length of the equilateral triangle.
   - Without additional constraints or information, any of these values could theoretically be the side length of an equilateral triangle.

6. **Verify the Accuracy of Current Steps:**
   - We have determined that \( z \) likely represents the side length of the equilateral triangle.
   - We need to select the closest possible value from the given choices.

7. **Refine Any Errors:**
   - There are no apparent errors in the interpretation of the problem. The assumption that \( z \) is the side length is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.

8. **Revisit Previous Steps:**
   - The interpretation of \( z \) as the side length is logical given the equilateral nature of the triangle.
   - The problem does not provide additional context, so the side length is the most reasonable interpretation.

**Conclusion:**
- Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or context, we select the most reasonable side length from the given options.

**Solution Section:**

- Given that \( \triangle RST \) is equilateral, all sides are equal.
- The problem asks for \( z \), which we interpret as the side length of the triangle.
- The answer choices are 7, 9, 12, and 15.
- Without additional constraints, any of these could be a valid side length.
- We select the most reasonable or common side length for an equilateral triangle from the given choices.

**Final Answer: C** (12)
