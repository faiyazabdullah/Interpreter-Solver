**Step 1: Analyze the Question and Given Information**
- We have two angles, \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \), with the given information that their measures are equal: \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) \).
- We are given the expressions for their measures: \( m \angle 3 = x - 12 \) and \( m \angle 6 = 72 \).
- We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- The task is to determine the value of \( x \) based on the equality of the angles and the given expressions.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) \), we can equate their expressions:
  \[
  x - 12 = 72
  \]

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**
- Add 12 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x - 12 + 12 = 72 + 12
  \]
  \[
  x = 84
  \]

**Step 5: Compare the Calculated Result with the Given Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( x \) is 84.
- The answer choices are: A. 6, B. 18, C. 72, D. 84.
- The calculated value matches choice D.

**Step 6: Verification and Reflection**
- Reassess the calculations to ensure no errors were made.
- The steps followed the logical process of equating the given expressions and solving for \( x \).
- The calculations are straightforward and correct.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is choice D.

**Solution:**
To find \( x \), we equated the expressions for the measures of the angles:
\[
x - 12 = 72
\]
Solving for \( x \), we add 12 to both sides:
\[
x = 72 + 12 = 84
\]
The calculated value of \( x \) is 84, which corresponds to answer choice D.

Final Answer: D
