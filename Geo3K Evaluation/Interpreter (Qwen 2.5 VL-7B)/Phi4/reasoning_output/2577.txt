**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a geometric figure described as a parallelogram \( PSTU \).
- The figure has four right angles at points \( P, S, T, \) and \( U \). 
- All sides \( PS, ST, TU, \) and \( PU \) are given as sides of the figure.
- The length of \( ST \) is specifically mentioned.

**Step 2: Summarize the Findings**
- A parallelogram with all right angles is a rectangle.
- Therefore, \( PSTU \) is a rectangle.
- Rectangles have opposite sides that are equal in length, i.e., \( PS = TU \) and \( ST = PU \).
- Right angles imply that \( PS \perp ST \) and \( TU \perp PU \).

**Step 3: Identify the Unknown**
- We need to find the value of \( x \), which is the length of \( ST \).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( PSTU \) is a rectangle, the lengths of opposite sides are equal.
- The problem does not provide explicit lengths for any side, but it mentions the length of \( ST \).

**Step 5: Explore and Calculate**
- Let's assume the rectangle's sides are labeled as follows: \( PS = a \), \( ST = b \), \( TU = a \), \( PU = b \).
- The problem states that \( \text{Length of } ST = b \).

**Step 6: Verify and Refine Calculations**
- Since no specific numerical values are given for \( a \) or \( b \), we rely on the answer choices to determine \( b \).
- The problem does not provide additional constraints or relationships, so we assume \( b \) is one of the given choices.

**Step 7: Reassess and Reflect**
- Given the answer choices \( A. 3 \), \( B. 4.5 \), \( C. 9 \), \( D. 13.5 \), we need to select the most reasonable value for \( b \) based on typical geometric properties.
- Without additional constraints, we assume \( b \) is a reasonable length for a rectangle side.

**Step 8: Final Decision**
- Since no additional information is provided to calculate \( b \) directly, we choose the value that is most typical for a rectangle side length in a problem context.
- The choice \( C. 9 \) is a reasonable assumption for the length of a side in a typical geometric problem.

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and typical problem setups, the length of \( ST \) is most reasonably assumed to be \( 9 \) based on the provided answer choices and the nature of the problem.
