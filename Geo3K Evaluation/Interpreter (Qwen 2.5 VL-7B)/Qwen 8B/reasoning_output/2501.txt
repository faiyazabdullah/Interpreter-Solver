Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have triangle PQR, and points S and T. The lines ST is parallel to RQ. Also, PS is 12.5 units, SR is 5 units, and PT is 15 units. We need to find TQ. 

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the problem. Let me sketch triangle PQR. Points P, Q, R forming a triangle. Then there's point S on PR? Wait, because there's a line from P to S and then S to T. Also, line TQ connects T to Q. And ST is parallel to RQ. Hmm. Also, given that PS = 12.5, SR = 5, so PR must be PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5 units. So S divides PR into segments of 12.5 and 5. 

Now, since ST is parallel to RQ, maybe similar triangles are involved here. Because when a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it creates similar triangles. But I need to confirm which triangles are similar. 

Let me think. Since ST || RQ, and considering the transversals. Maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR? Or perhaps another pair. Wait, but where is point T located? There's a line from S to T and then T to Q. So T is connected to Q. So maybe triangle PTS is similar to something?

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to RQ, then maybe the triangles involving those sides. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point P at (0,0), Q at (a,0), and R somewhere else. Wait, but without loss of generality, maybe coordinate system can simplify things. Alternatively, use ratios.

Since ST is parallel to RQ, by the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally. However, in this case, ST is parallel to RQ, but where is line ST located? It starts at S on PR and goes to T. So maybe the line ST intersects PQ or QR? Wait, the line TQ is mentioned. So point T is connected to Q. Let me think again.

Wait, the given lines include Line(P,S), Line(S,T), Line(T,Q). So starting from P to S, then S to T, then T to Q. Therefore, point T is somewhere such that ST is connected to TQ. Also, since ST is parallel to RQ, so ST || RQ. So maybe triangle PST similar to triangle PQR? Wait, but how?

Alternatively, since ST || RQ, then angle PST equals angle PQR, and angle SPT equals angle QPR? Not sure yet. Let me think about the ratios. Since S is on PR, and ST is parallel to RQ, then maybe the ratio of PS/PR equals some ratio related to the other triangle.

Alternatively, using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me set up coordinates. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me take point P at (0,0), R at (c,0) since PR is a line. Wait, but earlier I thought PR is divided into PS=12.5 and SR=5, so PR length is 17.5. But coordinates might complicate unless I assign specific values. Alternatively, assign coordinates based on PR as x-axis.

Let me set P at (0,0) and R at (17.5, 0), so that PR is along x-axis. Then S is between P and R. Since PS=12.5, then S is at (12.5, 0). Wait, but then SR would be 17.5 - 12.5 = 5, which matches the given. Now, point Q is somewhere not on PR. Let me denote coordinates for Q as (x,y). Then line RQ connects R(17.5,0) to Q(x,y). Line ST is parallel to RQ. Point T is connected via S(12.5,0) to T, and then T to Q. 

But how do I find coordinates of T? Since ST is parallel to RQ. Let me parametrize line ST. Let me suppose that vector ST is same direction as RQ. Vector RQ is (x - 17.5, y - 0) = (x - 17.5, y). Vector ST should be proportional to this. But point S is at (12.5, 0). Let me denote T as (t_x, t_y). Then vector ST is (t_x - 12.5, t_y - 0) = (t_x - 12.5, t_y). This vector should be scalar multiple of vector RQ. So:

(t_x - 12.5)/(x - 17.5) = t_y / y = k, some scalar.

Also, since T lies on line TQ. Wait, but T is connected to Q. Wait, the line TQ is part of the problem. So point T is somewhere such that ST || RQ and T is connected to Q. Maybe T lies on PQ? Or somewhere else?

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to RQ, and T is connected to Q. Let me think of the line ST being parallel to RQ, so the slope of ST equals slope of RQ. Let me compute slopes. Slope of RQ is (y - 0)/(x - 17.5) = y/(x - 17.5). Slope of ST is (t_y - 0)/(t_x - 12.5) = t_y/(t_x - 12.5). So these slopes are equal. Hence,

t_y / (t_x - 12.5) = y / (x - 17.5).

Additionally, since T lies on line TQ. Wait, but T is connected to Q. So the line TQ is from T to Q. But how does that relate? Maybe T lies on some other line? Wait, original problem has line TQ as part of the structure. Also, there's line PQ, QR, RP, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe T lies on PQ? Let me check. Suppose T lies on PQ. Then line TQ would be part of PQ. But then ST is parallel to RQ. Let me see. If T is on PQ, then coordinates of T can be expressed parametrically. Let me suppose that. Let me parameterize PQ. Let me assume coordinates for Q. Wait, but I don't know coordinates of Q. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, since we have lengths PS=12.5, SR=5, PT=15. Wait, PT is given as 15. So point T is such that PT is 15. Wait, but where is T located? Is T on some line? Earlier, the lines are Line(P,S), Line(S,T), Line(T,Q). So T is connected to S and Q. So T is a point connected to S and Q. So maybe T is somewhere in the plane such that ST is parallel to RQ. Also, PT is given as 15. 

So, given that, perhaps using similar triangles. Since ST || RQ, then triangles PST and PQR may be similar? Wait, but ST is parallel to RQ. Let me check angles. Angle at P is common between triangle PST and PQR? No, because ST is parallel to RQ, so angle between SP and ST would correspond to angle between PR and RQ? Not sure. Maybe triangle PST ~ triangle PQR?

Wait, if ST || RQ, then angle PST equals angle PQR (corresponding angles), and angle PSR equals angle PRQ? Wait, no. Let me think. If ST is parallel to RQ, then when you look at transversal PR, the corresponding angles would be equal. So angle at S between SP and ST corresponds to angle at R between RQ and... Well, maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe triangle PQT is similar to something?

Alternatively, using the concept of intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). Since ST || RQ, then the ratio of PS to PR should equal the ratio of PT to PQ? Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me recall the intercept theorem: if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. 

But in this case, ST is parallel to RQ. Let me imagine triangle PRQ? Wait, RQ is one side of triangle PRQ. If ST is parallel to RQ and passes through S on PR, then according to intercept theorem, the line ST would divide the other side (PQ?) proportionally. Wait, but where is T? 

Wait, the line ST is parallel to RQ, and S is on PR. So maybe T is on PQ? Because otherwise, the intercept theorem would require the line ST to intersect another side. For example, if ST is parallel to RQ and cuts PR at S, then it must intersect PQ at T. That makes sense. So T is on PQ such that ST || RQ. Then by intercept theorem, PS/PR = PT/PQ. 

Yes! That seems right. So if ST || RQ, then PS/PR = PT/PQ. Let me verify. In triangle PRQ, line ST is drawn through S on PR and T on PQ, parallel to RQ. Therefore, by the basic proportionality theorem, PS/PR = PT/PQ. 

Given that, we can write PS / PR = PT / PQ. 

We know PS = 12.5, PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5. PT is given as 15. So plugging in:

12.5 / 17.5 = 15 / PQ

Solving for PQ:

PQ = (15 * 17.5) / 12.5 

Calculate that: 15 * 17.5 = 262.5; 262.5 / 12.5 = 21. So PQ = 21. 

Therefore, PQ is 21 units. Now, since T is on PQ, and PT = 15, then TQ = PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. So TQ is 6. Which is option B. 

But wait, let me make sure that my assumption that T is on PQ is correct. Because the problem says there's a line TQ. If T is on PQ, then yes, line TQ would just be part of PQ. But maybe there's more to it. Let me check if there's another possibility. 

Alternatively, maybe T is not on PQ but somewhere else. But given that ST is parallel to RQ, and S is on PR, the only way for ST to be parallel to RQ and connect to T would be if T is on PQ. Otherwise, if T were elsewhere, like on QR or something, but then the line ST wouldn't necessarily be parallel. 

Another way to think: If we consider triangle PRQ, with ST || RQ cutting PR at S and PQ at T, then yes, T is on PQ. Therefore, the calculation holds. 

Thus, TQ = PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. So answer is B. 

But let me cross-verify with another approach. Let's say using mass point or coordinate geometry. 

Suppose coordinates: Let me take P at (0,0), R at (17.5, 0), S at (12.5, 0). Let me assume Q at (0, b) to make calculations easier. Wait, but then RQ would be from (17.5, 0) to (0, b). Then line ST is parallel to RQ. Let me define coordinates for T. 

If Q is at (0, b), then RQ has slope (b - 0)/(0 - 17.5) = -b/17.5. Line ST has to have the same slope. Since S is at (12.5, 0), then equation of ST is y - 0 = (-b/17.5)(x - 12.5). 

This line ST meets PQ at T. Since PQ is from P(0,0) to Q(0,b), which is vertical line x=0. So intersection point T is where x=0. Plugging x=0 into ST equation:

y = (-b/17.5)(0 - 12.5) = (-b/17.5)(-12.5) = (12.5b)/17.5 = (5b)/7. 

Therefore, T is at (0, 5b/7). Therefore, PT is the distance from P(0,0) to T(0, 5b/7), which is 5b/7. Given PT=15, so 5b/7 = 15 => b = 15*(7/5)=21. So Q is at (0,21). Then PQ length is from (0,0) to (0,21): 21 units. Then TQ is from T(0,5*21/7)=T(0,15) to Q(0,21), which is 21 - 15 = 6. Same result. So TQ=6. 

Hence, answer is B. 

Another check: Using ratios. From the first method, PS/PR = PT/PQ => 12.5/17.5 = 15/PQ => PQ = 15 * 17.5 / 12.5 = 15 * 1.4 = 21. Then TQ = PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. 

All methods lead to TQ=6. Therefore, answer is B.
