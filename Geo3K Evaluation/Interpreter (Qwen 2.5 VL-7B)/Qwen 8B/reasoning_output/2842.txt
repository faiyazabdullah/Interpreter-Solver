MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a parallelogram ABCD. The question is asking for the measure of angle DAC. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees). Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other.

But wait, there are some specific constraints here. The problem mentions that Angle(B,C,D) is a right angle. Wait, so angle at point C between points B, C, D? That would be angle BCD. But since it's a parallelogram, angle BCD is equal to angle BAD because they are opposite angles. However, if angle BCD is a right angle, then angle BAD is also a right angle. But then, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. If one angle is 90 degrees, then all angles should be 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. Wait, but rectangles are a type of parallelogram with all angles right angles. But the problem says that only angle BCD is a right angle? Or is there more?

Wait, looking back at the constraints: RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)). So both angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles. Wait, angle ADC is at point D, between points A, D, C. And angle BCD is at point C between points B, C, D. So those two angles are both right angles. Hmm. So if both these angles are right angles, then the parallelogram has two right angles. But in a general parallelogram, if two adjacent angles are right angles, then all angles are right angles. Because consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle ADC is 90°, then angle DCB is also 90°, as given. Then angle ABC would be supplementary to angle ADC, which is 90°, so angle ABC would be 90°, and same with angle BAD. Therefore, all angles are 90°, meaning it's a rectangle. 

Wait, but in that case, the parallelogram is a rectangle. So all angles are right angles. Then, what is angle DAC? Let me visualize the rectangle ABCD. Let me label the points. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90°. So points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is horizontal, BC vertical, CD horizontal, DA vertical. So if you imagine a rectangle, with A at bottom left, B at bottom right, C at top right, D at top left. Then, angle DAC is the angle at point A between points D, A, and C. So from point A, connecting to D and C. Since AD is vertical (from A up to D), and AC is the diagonal from A to C. So angle between AD (which is vertical) and AC (the diagonal). 

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So triangle ADC is a right triangle? Wait, no. Because in rectangle ABCD, diagonal AC connects A to C. So triangle ADC has sides AD, DC, and AC. Since AD and DC are sides of the rectangle, perpendicular to each other. So triangle ADC is a right-angled triangle at D. Wait, angle ADC is 90°, as per the given constraint. So in triangle ADC, angle at D is 90°, so angle DAC is one of the acute angles of this right triangle. 

So in triangle ADC, angle at D is 90°, so the sum of angles at A and C is 90°. Now, angle DAC is angle at A. To find its measure, I need to know the ratio of the sides. Let me denote lengths. Let’s say AB = CD = x, and BC = AD = y. Since it's a rectangle, all sides are known. But without specific lengths, maybe we can assign variables. However, the problem does not give numerical values for side lengths. Wait, but maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since angle DAC is part of the rectangle. Let me think about coordinates. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose AB is along x-axis, AD along y-axis. So:

- Point A: (0,0)
- Point B: (a,0) for some a > 0
- Point D: (0,b) for some b > 0
- Point C: (a,b) because in a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC, etc.

Then, diagonal AC goes from (0,0) to (a,b). So the slope of AC is (b)/(a). The line AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,b). So angle between AD (vertical line) and AC is angle DAC. 

To find the measure of angle DAC, which is the angle between the vertical line AD and the diagonal AC. So tan(theta) = opposite over adjacent. In triangle ADC, right-angled at D. So tan(angle DAC) = opposite / adjacent = DC / AD. Wait, DC is horizontal side, which is length a, and AD is vertical side, length b. Wait, in triangle ADC, angle at D is 90°, so sides:

- AD = b
- DC = a
- AC = sqrt(a² + b²)

So angle at A (DAC) is opposite to DC, so tan(angle DAC) = DC / AD = a/b. Therefore, angle DAC = arctan(a/b).

But without knowing the ratio of a to b, how can we determine the exact measure? The problem gives answer choices, but none of them are variable. This suggests that perhaps there's missing information, or perhaps there's something else I'm missing from the constraints.

Wait, but the problem states that there are certain equalities. Let me check again the constraints.

The problem lists several constraints:

- Parallelogram ABCD, so opposite sides are equal and parallel.

- RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)): so angle ADC is 90°, which we already considered.

- RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)): angle BCD is 90°, which makes sense in a rectangle.

Additionally, there are constraints on the sides:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B), LengthOf(Line(C,D)): which is true in a parallelogram, since opposite sides are equal.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C), LengthOf(Line(D,A)): same thing, since BC and DA are opposite sides.

Also, AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C), AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D)): Not sure what that means. Maybe it refers to the sum of angles? Wait, the original problem might have a typo or misformatting. Let me recheck:

Original constraints:

AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C)
AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)

Wait, maybe there was a formatting error. Perhaps it meant that the sum of angles at A,D,C? Or maybe that the sum of angles at those points? Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say that the sum of angles in certain triangles?

Alternatively, perhaps the AngleSumOf(...) refers to adding angles. For example, AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C) could mean the sum of angles at A, D, C? But in a triangle, the sum is 180°, but here it's three points... Maybe that's a mistranslation or formatting issue. Given that, perhaps the original intent was to mention that the angles at A, D, C are being considered, but perhaps it's redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the problem had more constraints that got lost in translation. For example, if the user intended to write that the sum of angles around a point or something similar.

But given that the problem seems to be about a rectangle, since two adjacent angles are right angles, making it a rectangle. Then, angle DAC depends on the aspect ratio of the rectangle. Without knowing the sides' lengths, how can we compute the measure of angle DAC? There's insufficient data unless there's more constraints.

Wait, maybe there's another constraint. Let me check again.

Looking at the list of constraints:

- IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A): this just confirms that lines AB, BC, CD, DA form the parallelogram.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B), Line(C,D)), etc., which is standard for parallelograms.

But perhaps there's a missing piece here. Wait, the problem may have been transcribed incorrectly. Let me look again at the original problem statement.

The problem says:

Given geometric constraints:

Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)

Points A, B, C, D.

Lines AB, BC, CD, DA.

Angles at A,B,C,D.

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C))

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))

IsSideOf(...)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B), Line(C,D))

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C), Line(D,A))

AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C)

AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)

Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the transcription. Perhaps the last parts were meant to be "AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C))" and "AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D))" equals something? Or perhaps the AngleSumOf(...) is referring to the sum of angles in a particular triangle or quadrilateral?

Alternatively, maybe the problem originally said that the sum of angles at A, D, C is equal to something? But without clear context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the sum of angles at A, D, C is equal to the sum of angles at B, C, D? Which would make sense in a parallelogram. But in a parallelogram, the sum of all four angles is 360°, so if two pairs of opposite angles are equal, then each pair sums to 180°. But if two of the angles are right angles, then all are right angles. Hence, the sum of angles at A, D, C would be 90+90+90=270°, and similarly for others? Not sure.

But maybe this is leading us nowhere. Let's go back.

Since the problem gives answer choices, and we need to pick one. However, with the current info, angle DAC depends on the ratio of sides. Unless there's more constraints. Wait, perhaps the fact that angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles implies that it's a square? No, because a square has all sides equal. But if it's a rectangle, then sides can vary. So without knowing the ratio of sides, angle DAC cannot be determined numerically. 

This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or that I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem again.

Wait, the problem says "Use parallelogram ABCD to find m∠DAC." But given that it's a parallelogram with two right angles, which makes it a rectangle. So in a rectangle, angle DAC is dependent on the rectangle's dimensions. But since no specific measurements are given, how can we determine the measure?

Unless there's a property I'm missing. For instance, if there are additional constraints like diagonals intersecting at certain angles or something else. Wait, the problem includes "AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C)" and "AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D)". Maybe this refers to the sum of angles in triangle ADC and triangle BCD? Let me consider that.

In triangle ADC, angles are at A, D, and C. We know angle at D is 90°, and angle at C is angle DCA. Similarly, in triangle BCD, angles are at B, C, D. But angle at C is 90°, and angle at D is angle BDC. But since ABCD is a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So in triangle ADC, angle at A (DAC) plus angle at C (DCA) plus 90° equals 180°. So angle DAC + angle DCA = 90°. Similarly, in triangle BCD, angle at B (angle CBD) + angle at D (angle BDC) + 90° = 180°, so angle CBD + angle BDC = 90°. But without more info, I still can't find the measure of angle DAC.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between angles in different triangles. Since ABCD is a rectangle, diagonals AC and BD bisect each other. So in triangle ADC, angle DAC is equal to angle BCA? Because diagonals in a rectangle bisect each other and create congruent triangles. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Let me try assigning coordinates again. Suppose ABCD is a rectangle with A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,b), D(0,b). Diagonal AC goes from (0,0) to (a,b). The angle DAC is the angle between DA (which is vertical line from A(0,0) to D(0,b)) and AC (diagonal to C(a,b)).

So vector DA is (0,b) - (0,0) = (0,b). Vector AC is (a,b) - (0,0) = (a,b). The angle between DA and AC can be found using the dot product formula.

Dot product of DA and AC vectors is (0)(a) + (b)(b) = b².

Magnitude of DA is sqrt(0² + b²) = b.

Magnitude of AC is sqrt(a² + b²).

So cos(theta) = (b²) / (b * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arcsin(a / sqrt(a² + b²)).

But this is angle DAC. So unless we know the ratio of a to b, we can't compute the exact value. 

However, the answer choices are fixed numbers: 25, 49, 72, 101. These are all approximate values. So maybe there's an assumption that the rectangle is a square? If it's a square, then a = b, so angle DAC would be 45°, which isn't among the options. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific ratio implied by the problem.

Wait, maybe I missed another constraint. Let me check again the initial problem statement. It mentions "AngleSumOf(Angles(A,D,C)" and "AngleSumOf(Angles(B,C,D)". Maybe this refers to the sum of angles at those points? Like, sum of angles at A, D, C? But in a parallelogram, each angle is 90°, so sum would be 270°, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if it refers to the sum of the measures of angles in triangle ADC and triangle BCD? For example, in triangle ADC, sum is 180°, and same for BCD. But again, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The problem says:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C))
RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)"

So angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles. As previously established, this makes the parallelogram a rectangle. Hence, all angles are right angles. Thus, in this case, the diagonals of the rectangle are equal and bisect each other. But again, angle DAC is still dependent on the rectangle's proportions.

Wait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption that the parallelogram is a square? But then angle DAC would be 45°, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes a specific ratio based on the answer choices. Let's see. For example, if angle DAC is 45°, but that's not an option. If it's 30°, tan(theta)=1/√3 ≈ 0.577, so a/b = 1/√3 → a/b = √3/3. If it's 60°, then tan(theta) = √3, so a/b = √3. None of these correspond to the given options.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think differently. What if the parallelogram is not a rectangle? Wait, but if two adjacent angles are right angles, then all angles are right angles. Because in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 90°, the next one is 90°, and so on. Hence, it must be a rectangle. So my earlier conclusion holds.

But then why are the answer choices given? Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me think again about angle DAC.

If the rectangle has sides of length a and b, then tan(angle DAC) = opposite/adjacent = DC/AD = a/b. So angle DAC = arctan(a/b). 

Suppose we assume that the sides are in a ratio that leads to one of the given answers. For example:

If angle DAC is 45°, then a/b = 1 → a = b → square.

If angle DAC is 30°, then a/b = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.

If angle DAC is 60°, then a/b = √3 ≈ 1.732.

But the options are 25, 49, 72, 101. Let me calculate tan(25°), tan(49°), tan(72°), tan(101°):

tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663

tan(49°) ≈ 1.1504

tan(72°) ≈ 3.0777

tan(101°) ≈ -5.671 (but since angle DAC is acute, maybe take absolute value?)

But how does this relate to the ratio a/b?

Without knowing a/b, we can't determine. But maybe there's a clue in the problem's other constraints. Let me check again.

The problem includes "Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D), LengthOf(Line(D,A))". Wait, but in a parallelogram, CD equals AB and DA equals BC. So if CD equals DA, then AB = CD = DA = BC. So that would imply that all sides are equal, making it a rhombus. Wait, but we also have that angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles. So if it's a rhombus with two right angles, then it must be a square. Because in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and if one angle is 90°, all are 90°, hence a square. 

Wait! Oh! This is crucial. Let me re-express this. 

The problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D), LengthOf(Line(D,A)).

So CD equals DA. In a parallelogram, CD is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So if CD = DA, then AB = CD = DA = BC. Hence, all sides are equal, making it a rhombus. But also, angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles. So combining these two facts: a rhombus with two right angles. But a rhombus with one right angle is a square. Because in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 90°, then the adjacent angle is 90°, and so on, making all angles 90°, hence a square.

Ah! So the parallelogram is actually a square. Hence, all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. Therefore, angle DAC is the angle between DA (side of square) and diagonal AC. In a square, the diagonal divides the 90° angle into two 45° angles. So angle DAC would be 45°. But 45° isn't among the answer choices. Wait, but the answer choices are 25, 49, 72, 101. Hmm. This contradicts.

Wait, but maybe the problem didn't state that CD equals DA, but rather that LengthOf(Line(C,D) equals LengthOf(Line(D,A)? Let me check the original constraints again.

The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)"

So, it's stating that the length of CD equals the length of DA. In a parallelogram, CD is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So if CD equals DA, then AB = CD = DA = BC. Hence, all sides are equal, making it a rhombus. And with two right angles, it becomes a square. So angle DAC is 45°, which is not in the options. This suggests either a mistake in the problem or in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I misread the constraint. Let me check again:

The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)"

Which probably means that the length of CD equals the length of DA. So yes, CD = DA. Hence, all sides equal. So it's a square. Hence, angle DAC is 45°, but that's not an option. So what's going on here?

Wait, maybe the problem is not a square. Let me think again. If CD equals DA, and it's a parallelogram, then CD = AB, DA = BC. So AB = CD = DA = BC. Hence, all sides are equal. So it's a rhombus. And since two of its angles are right angles, it must be a square. Hence, angle DAC is 45°, which is not among the options. But the options are 25, 49, 72, 101. None of these are 45. So this suggests either a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says that LengthOf(Line(C,D) equals LengthOf(Line(D,A)? Or maybe it's a different constraint. Let me double-check the original problem statement.

Original constraints include:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)

So, this means that CD equals DA. Hence, in the parallelogram, CD = DA. But in a parallelogram, CD is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So CD = DA => AB = CD = DA = BC. So all sides are equal. Hence, it's a rhombus. With two right angles, it must be a square. So angle DAC is 45°, but since this isn't an option, maybe there's an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that LengthOf(Line(C,D) equals LengthOf(Line(B,C)? Or another combination. Or maybe there was a typo, and instead of DA, it's DC?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not requiring CD = DA, but instead that AB = CD and BC = DA, which is always true in a parallelogram. So maybe the user made a mistake in copying the constraints. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a parallelogram but a different quadrilateral? No, the first constraint says Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a rectangle, despite having two right angles. How is that possible? In a parallelogram, if two adjacent angles are right angles, then all are right angles. So it must be a rectangle. Hence, a square if all sides are equal. But if sides are not equal, then it's a rectangle but not a square. But then, the condition CD = DA would require it to be a square. 

This contradiction suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a different interpretation. 

Let me try assuming that the parallelogram is not a rectangle. Wait, but if angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles, then it must be a rectangle. Let me confirm:

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle ADC is 90°, then angle DCB (which is adjacent) is 180° - 90° = 90°. Then angle ABC is supplementary to angle DCB, so 90°, and angle BAD is supplementary to angle ABC, so 90°. Hence, all angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. 

So it's definitely a rectangle. And with CD = DA, it must be a square. Hence, angle DAC is 45°, which is not an option. But since the options don't include 45°, maybe the problem expects a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a rectangle but a different shape. Let me think: if it's a parallelogram with two right angles, but not necessarily a rectangle. Is that possible?

No, because in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 90°, the next must be 90°, and so on. So all angles are 90°. Hence, it's a rectangle. 

Thus, the only possibility is that it's a square, making angle DAC 45°, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects an approximation? For example, if the square is skewed slightly, but that contradicts the given conditions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different configuration. Let me think of a non-rectangle parallelogram with two right angles. Is that possible? For example, if it's a degenerate parallelogram? No, because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal. If two angles are right angles, it must be a rectangle. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. Given that the options do not include 45°, but the calculation suggests it, perhaps there's an error in the problem's constraints. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about angle DAC but another angle? Let me check the question again.

The question asks for m∠DAC. So angle at A, between D and C. In a square, this is 45°, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is closest to one of them. The closest option to 45° is 49° (option B). But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming it's a square.

Wait, let's think again. If CD = DA, and it's a rectangle, then CD = DA implies that the sides are equal. So CD = DA => AB = CD = DA = BC. So all sides are equal, making it a square. Hence, angle DAC is 45°. But since this is not an option, maybe the problem intended CD = BC or something else. For example, if CD = BC, then it's a square. But if CD = AB, which it always is.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the labeling of the points. Let me verify the order of the points. In a parallelogram ABCD, the order matters. Typically, the vertices are labeled in order, so that AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. So if it's a rectangle, the points are arranged such that AB is adjacent to BC, etc. 

Assuming the standard labeling, then angle DAC is formed by points D-A-C. So in a square, this is indeed 45°. 

Given that, and since 45° is not an option, but the closest option is 49°, which is close to 45°, maybe the intended answer is B. However, this is purely speculative. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my steps.

Another possibility: maybe the problem is not a rectangle, but a different parallelogram where angle ADC and angle BCD are right angles, but the other angles are not. Wait, but as discussed, this is impossible. 

Wait, let me think of a different scenario. Suppose the parallelogram is not convex? But no, all parallelograms are convex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is not a rectangle, but the given constraints allow for some flexibility. For example, if angle ADC is a right angle, but angle BCD is also a right angle, but the sides are not equal. Wait, but in a parallelogram, if angle ADC is 90°, then angle BCD is also 90°, and hence, the figure is a rectangle. So sides must be equal. 

I'm stuck. Given the constraints, the only logical conclusion is that it's a square, making angle DAC 45°, which is not an option. But since the options are given, and assuming that there might be a mistake in the problem, perhaps the intended answer is 45°, and the closest option is B (49°). Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, let's try calculating with hypothetical values. Let's say the rectangle has sides of length 1 and √3. Then, angle DAC would be arctan(√3/1) = 60°, which is not an option. Or if sides are 1 and 1, angle is 45°. If sides are 1 and 2, then angle is arctan(1/2) ≈ 26.565°, which is close to 25° (option A). Or if sides are 1 and 1.2, then arctan(1/1.2) ≈ 39.8°, closer to 49°? No, 39.8° is closer to 49° than to 25°? No, 39.8° is between 25 and 49. But without knowing the ratio, it's impossible to say.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the parallelogram is a rectangle with sides in a certain ratio. For example, if angle DAC is 72°, then tan(72°) ≈ 3.0777, so a/b = 3.0777, implying that the sides are in a ratio of approximately 3.08:1. But how would we know this ratio?

Since the problem provides answer choices, and assuming that the intended answer is one of them, perhaps the expected answer is 45°, and the closest option is B (49°). But this is a stretch. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem involves a different angle. Let me reconsider the definition of angle DAC. Point D, A, C. So at point A, between D and C. In a rectangle, this is the angle between DA and AC. But in a square, this is 45°, as before. If it's a rectangle with DA = 1 and DC = 2, then angle DAC is arctan(2/1) = 63.43°, which is closest to 63°, but not in the options. If DC = 1 and DA = 2, then angle DAC is arctan(1/2) ≈ 26.56°, closest to 25° (option A). 

But since the problem states that CD equals DA, making it a square, then angle DAC is 45°, which is not an option. Hence, there must be an error. 

Given that, and since the options are A-D, and assuming that the problem intended for it to be a square, even though 45° is not listed, perhaps the closest option is B (49°). But this is highly speculative. Alternatively, the problem may have intended for the parallelogram to be a different type, and there's a mistake in the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a rectangle but about a different quadrilateral. Let me try to think outside the box. Suppose it's a parallelogram with angle ADC and BCD as right angles, but not a rectangle. How is that possible? 

Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle ADC is 90°, then angle DAB is also 90°, because they are opposite angles. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle ADC is equal to angle ABC. And angle DAB is equal to angle BCD. 

Wait, if angle ADC is 90°, then angle ABC is also 90°. And angle BCD is given as 90°, so angle DAB is also 90°. Hence, all angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. Hence, it must be a rectangle. 

Thus, I conclude that the problem contains conflicting constraints, or there's a typo. Assuming that it's a square, and angle DAC is 45°, which is not an option, but since 45° is closest to 49°, I might choose B. However, this is uncertain. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the measure of angle CAD in a different configuration. Let me try one last time.

If the parallelogram is a rectangle, and angle DAC is 45°, but the options don't have it. If the problem had said that the parallelogram is a square, then the answer is 45°, but since it's not an option, maybe the intended answer is B (49°), which is closest. Or perhaps the problem had a different setup.

Given that, and since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with B.49°, as it's the closest to 45°, even though it's not precise. Hence, Final Answer: B.
