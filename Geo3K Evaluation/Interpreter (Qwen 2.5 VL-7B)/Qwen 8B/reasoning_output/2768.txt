MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have angles 1, 3, and 4 mentioned. The question says that the measure of angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 4. 

First, I need to visualize the figure. Since the problem mentions angles labeled as 1, 3, and 4, it's probably a diagram involving intersecting lines or maybe a triangle? Wait, but without seeing the actual figure, I might have to make some assumptions based on common configurations. Let me think about possible scenarios where these angles could be related.

One possibility is that these angles are formed by two intersecting lines, creating vertical angles and adjacent angles. For example, if two lines cross, they form vertical angles which are equal, and adjacent angles that are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees). But then there are four angles around the intersection point. However, here we have angles labeled 1, 3, and 4. Maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles? Or perhaps they are adjacent?

Alternatively, another scenario is that these angles are part of a triangle. If angles 1 and 3 are angles within a triangle, then maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle or something else. Wait, but triangles have three angles, so if there are more angles mentioned, maybe it's a different configuration.

Wait, another common setup is when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, forming various angles like corresponding, alternate interior, etc. But again, without the exact figure, it's tricky. However, since angles 1, 3, and 4 are mentioned, maybe they are in a specific position.

Let me consider that angles 1 and 3 could be angles formed by a transversal. Suppose we have two parallel lines with a transversal, creating several angles. Let's assume that angle 1 and angle 3 are on different sides of the transversal. But how does angle 4 come into play?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a pentagon or some polygon with multiple angles. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Another thought: sometimes problems involve a triangle with an exterior angle. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles of a triangle, and angle 4 is an exterior angle. Then, the exterior angle would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Wait, that could be a possibility.

So, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two remote interior angles, then angle 4, being an exterior angle, would be their sum. Let me check: angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, so their sum is 110°. But none of the answer choices include 110, so that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an interior angle opposite to those?

Wait, maybe the angles aren't in a triangle. Let me think again. If angles 1 and 3 are vertical angles, then they should be equal. But here angle 1 is 50° and angle 3 is 60°, which are not equal. Therefore, they can't be vertical angles. So that's not the case.

Another possibility: maybe angles 1 and 3 are adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Wait, a linear pair adds up to 180°, so 50 + 60 = 110, which isn't 180. So that can't be either.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent angles at a point, meaning their sum is part of a larger angle? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the figure involves a quadrilateral? In a quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles is 360°, but again, unless we know more angles, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the figure has two intersecting lines, creating vertical angles and some other angles. For example, suppose there are two lines crossing, making eight angles. Let me label them as follows: suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are opposite each other, but no, they aren't equal. Wait, but if angle 1 is 50°, then its vertical angle is also 50°, and the other two angles would be 180-50=130°, so maybe angle 3 is one of those 130s? But the problem states angle 3 is 60°, so that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe the figure isn't just two intersecting lines. What if there are three lines? Or maybe a triangle with a line drawn inside?

Wait, here's another idea. Suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle, and angle 4 is another angle. Wait, but a triangle only has three angles. Unless there are other elements. Wait, maybe it's a triangle with an extended side, creating an exterior angle. Let me think.

For example, suppose you have triangle ABC, and angle 1 is at vertex A, angle 3 is at vertex B, and angle 4 is an exterior angle at vertex C. Then, according to the exterior angle theorem, the measure of the exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So if angle 1 and angle 3 are the two remote interior angles, then angle 4 would be 50+60=110°, which again isn't among the answer choices. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an angle formed by two intersecting lines, with angle 1 and angle 3 being adjacent to it. For example, imagine a straight line with two rays coming off it, forming angles. Suppose angle 1 is between two lines, angle 3 is another angle, and angle 4 is adjacent to them. Wait, this is getting too vague without the diagram.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to angles in a transversal with parallel lines. For instance, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc. Suppose angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle 3, but since they are not equal, that's impossible unless the lines aren't parallel. Wait, but if they are not parallel, then the angles wouldn't necessarily relate directly.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are in a star shape or some other figure. Hmm. This is really confusing without the diagram. Let me try to think differently.

Since the answer choices are A. 40, B. 50, C. 60, D. 70. Given that angle 1 is 50 and angle 3 is 60, the answer is likely one of these numbers. If I can find a relationship between these angles.

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are supplementary? Their sum is 110, which isn't 180. Not helpful. What if angle 4 is supplementary to one of them? Like, if angle 1 and angle 4 are supplementary, then angle 4 would be 130. Still not matching. If angle 3 and angle 4 are supplementary, then angle 4 would be 120. Nope.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involved where angle 4 is part of. Suppose angles 1 and 3 are angles of a triangle, and angle 4 is another angle. Wait, but then the third angle would be 180 - 50 - 60 = 70°, which is option D. So maybe angle 4 is that third angle?

But wait, why would angle 4 be the third angle? If angles 1 and 3 are two angles of a triangle, then angle 4 would be the third angle, which would be 70°, which is option D. That seems plausible. But how do we know that angles 1 and 3 are angles of a triangle?

Unless the figure shows a triangle with angles labeled 1 and 3, and angle 4 is the third angle. But since the original problem didn't specify, but given that the answer is among the choices, maybe that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal cutting through two lines, creating angles where angle 1 and angle 3 are on different sides, and angle 4 is another angle. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 3 are consecutive interior angles, then they'd be supplementary. But 50 + 60 = 110, which is not 180. So that doesn't work.

Wait, but if there are two transversals, maybe? For example, a triangle with two transversals... No, that's complicating.

Alternatively, think of a triangle with a line drawn from one vertex, creating two smaller triangles. For example, if angle 1 is an angle in one triangle, angle 3 is in another, and angle 4 is somewhere else. Not sure.

But considering that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180, and if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles of a triangle, then angle 4 would be 180 - 50 - 60 = 70. Which matches option D. So that seems promising. But why would angle 4 be the third angle?

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two remote interior angles, then angle 4 would be their sum. As before, 50 + 60 = 110, which is not an option. So that can't be.

Wait, but maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angle 3 is one of the remote interior angles. Then angle 4 would be the other remote interior angle? For instance, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then it's equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. Suppose angle 1 = angle 3 + angle 4. So if angle 1 is 50, then angle 3 + angle 4 = 50. But angle 3 is given as 60, which would mean angle 4 is negative. Impossible. So that's not right.

Alternatively, if angle 3 is an exterior angle, then it would be equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. Suppose angle 3 = angle 1 + angle 4. So 60 = 50 + angle 4 => angle 4 = 10. Not an option. Doesn't fit.

Hmm. Back to the triangle idea. If angles 1 and 3 are two angles of a triangle, then angle 4 is the third angle. So 180 - 50 - 60 = 70. So angle 4 is 70°, which is option D. That makes sense. But why would angles 1 and 3 be in the same triangle? Well, maybe the figure shows a triangle with angles labeled 1 and 3, and angle 4 is the third angle. But since the problem mentions angle 4, which is separate from angles 1 and 3, that could be possible.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with an angle bisector or something. Wait, but without the diagram, it's hard to tell. But given that 70 is an option, and the calculation leads to that, maybe that's the correct answer.

Another possibility: angles 1 and 3 are vertical angles. But earlier, we saw they are not equal. Wait, but if angle 1 is 50 and angle 3 is 60, then they can't be vertical. So that's invalid.

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are complementary? 50 + 60 = 110, not 90. No.

What if angle 1 and angle 3 are parts of a straight line? So together they make a straight angle? But 50 + 60 = 110, which is less than 180. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, angle 1 is part of a triangle, and angle 3 is an exterior angle. For instance, if angle 1 is an interior angle, and angle 3 is an exterior angle at the same vertex, then angle 3 would equal the sum of the other two interior angles. But then angle 1 plus angle 4 equals angle 3? Wait, if angle 3 is the exterior angle, then it's equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. Suppose angle 1 and angle 4 are the remote interior angles. Then angle 3 = angle 1 + angle 4. So 60 = 50 + angle 4 => angle 4 = 10. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, angle 1 is the exterior angle, so angle 1 = angle 3 + angle 4. So 50 = 60 + angle 4 => angle 4 = -10. Not possible.

This is perplexing. Maybe there's a different configuration. Let me think of a trapezoid or another quadrilateral. For example, in a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, and legs AD and BC. Angles at A and B might be supplementary to angles at D and C. But again, without knowing which angles correspond, it's hard to apply.

Wait, here's another thought. Suppose the figure is a pentagon or another polygon, but that's even more complex. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are in a transversal with two parallel lines. For example, if line l and line m are parallel, and a transversal cuts them, creating angles. Let's assign labels. Suppose angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle 3, but since they're not congruent, the lines aren't parallel. Wait, but if they are not parallel, then the angles don't have a direct relationship.

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are alternate interior angles, but again, for that, the lines would need to be parallel, leading to equality, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are on different transversals. For instance, if there are two transversals cutting two lines, creating multiple angles. But without specifics, it's unclear.

Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should go back to the triangle idea. Since the answer is likely 70°, which is option D, and the calculation gives that, even though the reasoning depends on assuming angles 1 and 3 are two angles of a triangle, which might be the case. Perhaps the diagram shows a triangle with angles 1 and 3, and angle 4 is the third angle. Thus, angle 4 = 180 - 50 - 60 = 70. Hence, answer D.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is vertically opposite to another angle, but given that angle 1 and 3 are given, it's still not clear. But since 70 is the only number that comes up from a valid calculation, I think that's the intended path.

Therefore, my conclusion is that angle 4 measures 70 degrees, so the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of ∠4, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- **m∠1 = 50°**
- **m∠3 = 60°**

We are told to find **m∠4**, and the answer choices are:
- A. 40  
- B. 50  
- C. 60  
- D. 70  

---

### Step 1: Consider Triangle Angle Sum

The most straightforward interpretation — especially when working with angles labeled sequentially (like ∠1, ∠3, and ∠4) — is that these angles may belong to the same triangle. In such a case, we can use the **Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**:

$$
\text{Sum of angles in a triangle} = 180^\circ
$$

Assuming ∠1 and ∠3 are two of the internal angles of a triangle, then:

$$
m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - m\angle 1 - m\angle 3 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ - 60^\circ = 70^\circ
$$

Thus, **m∠4 = 70°**.

---

### Step 2: Validate Against Answer Choices

From the computed value above, the measure of ∠4 is **70°**, which corresponds to **option D**.

Even though the exact visual diagram was not provided, the most logical assumption under standard geometric conventions — that ∠1 and ∠3 are two angles of a triangle — yields a consistent and valid result.
