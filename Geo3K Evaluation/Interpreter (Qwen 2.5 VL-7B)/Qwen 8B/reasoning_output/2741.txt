MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an equilateral pentagon PQRST inscribed in a circle U. We need to find the measure of angle PSR. The answer choices are 36°, 72°, 120°, or 144°. 

First, since it's an equilateral pentagon, all sides are equal. But wait, does that mean all sides are equal but angles can vary? Or is it regular? Wait, the term "equilateral" usually means all sides are equal, but angles might not be. However, since it's inscribed in a circle (a cyclic polygon), there might be some relations between the angles. 

But hold on, for a regular pentagon (which is both equilateral and equiangular) inscribed in a circle, each interior angle is 108°, and the central angles would be 72° each. But here, the pentagon is only stated as equilateral, not necessarily regular. However, being cyclic (inscribed in a circle) imposes certain conditions. 

In a cyclic polygon, the sum of each pair of opposite angles is supplementary? Wait, no, that applies to cyclic quadrilaterals. For polygons with more sides, the relationships are different. Let me recall: In a cyclic polygon, all vertices lie on a circle, so the central angles correspond to arcs. 

Since the pentagon is equilateral, all sides are equal chords of the circle. Equal chords subtend equal arcs. Therefore, each side corresponds to an arc of equal measure. Let me denote the arcs between consecutive points as follows: arc PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP. Since the pentagon is equilateral, these arcs should be equal? Wait, no. If the chords are equal, then their subtended arcs must be equal. Because in a circle, equal chords correspond to equal arcs. Therefore, each arc between consecutive vertices is equal. 

Wait, but a pentagon has five sides. If all sides are equal chords, then each arc between two consecutive vertices is equal. Therefore, the total circumference is divided into five equal arcs. Each arc would be 360° / 5 = 72°. Therefore, each arc between consecutive points is 72°. 

So, the central angles corresponding to each side are 72°. Now, how does this help us find angle PSR?

Let me visualize the pentagon. Points P, Q, R, S, T are on the circle. Let me try to figure out which arcs correspond to which angles. 

We need to find angle PSR. That is, at point S, between points P, S, R. So vertex at S, with segments SP and SR. To find the measure of this angle. 

In circle geometry, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle PSR intercepts an arc. Which arc? Let me think. 

The angle at S between P and R. So, the angle is formed by chords SP and SR. The intercepted arc would be the arc PR that does not contain S. Wait, because in inscribed angles, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs? Wait, no. Wait, when you have an inscribed angle, it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, if I have angle PSR, then the vertex is at S, and the sides are SP and SR. So the intercepted arc is the arc from P to R that does not pass through S. Because the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the arc that's opposite. Let me confirm. Suppose we have points P, S, R on the circle. Then angle at S between P and R intercepts arc PR. So the measure of angle PSR is half the measure of arc PR. 

Therefore, if I can find the measure of arc PR, then divide by 2 to get the angle. 

Now, earlier, I thought that each arc between consecutive points is 72°, since the pentagon is equilateral. So, moving around the circle, each adjacent pair of points is separated by 72°. So, starting from P, going to Q is 72°, Q to R another 72°, etc. 

So, the arc from P to Q is 72°, Q to R is 72°, R to S is 72°, S to T is 72°, and T back to P is 72°. Wait, but that adds up to 5*72=360°, which works. 

So, the arc from P to R would go through Q. So arc PQ + arc QR = 72 + 72 = 144°. Therefore, arc PR is 144°. Therefore, angle PSR, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc PR, would be half of that, which is 72°. 

Wait, but that would make angle PSR equal to 72°, which is option B. But wait, let me check again. Is the intercepted arc PR indeed 144°? 

But wait, maybe there's something wrong here. Because depending on the direction of the arc. The intercepted arc could also be the major arc PR. Wait, but in the case of an inscribed angle, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite the angle. So, if the angle is at S, then the intercepted arc is the arc that doesn't include S. 

So, points P and R are two vertices. The arc PR that doesn't pass through S. Given that the pentagon is labeled in order P-Q-R-S-T-P. So, moving from P to Q to R to S to T to P. 

So, the arc from P to R passing through Q is 144°, as before. The other arc from P to R passing through T and S would be the rest of the circle. Since total circumference is 360°, that arc would be 360 - 144 = 216°. 

But which arc is intercepted by angle PSR? Well, the angle at S between P and R. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, meaning the arc that does not contain the vertex S. 

So, if you imagine standing at point S, looking towards P and R. The arc that is opposite would be the arc PR that doesn't pass through S. Depending on the position of S. 

Given the pentagon is labeled consecutively P-Q-R-S-T-P, so after R comes S. So, the arc from P to R that goes through Q is 144°, and the arc from P to R that goes through T and S is 216°. 

Which arc is intercepted by angle PSR? Let me think about the inscribed angle theorem. The angle at S is formed by points P, S, R. The intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing S. So, the arc from P to R that does not include S. Which would be the shorter arc PR? Wait, depends on the positions. 

If the pentagon is convex and inscribed in the circle, then the arc PR that does not contain S would be the minor arc PR, which is 144°, as calculated. Therefore, angle PSR would be half of 144°, which is 72°. Hence, answer B. 

But wait, let me verify once again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that each arc between consecutive points is 72°. 

Because even though the pentagon is equilateral (so all sides are equal chords), but in a circle, equal chords correspond to equal arcs. Therefore, yes, each arc between consecutive vertices should be equal. Thus, each arc is 72°, leading to arc PR being 2*72=144°, making angle PSR=72°, which is option B. 

However, I remember that in regular pentagons, the internal angles are 108°, but here the pentagon isn't regular. Wait, but if it's cyclic and equilateral, maybe it's not regular. However, in this case, since all sides are equal chords, then the arcs between them are equal. Therefore, it's a cyclic equilateral pentagon with equal arcs. 

But let me consider another approach. Maybe using the fact that in a cyclic polygon, the sum of every other side... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps considering the central angles. 

Each side corresponds to a central angle of 72°, as above. Then, angle PSR is an inscribed angle. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in identifying the intercepted arc. Let me draw it mentally. 

Points P, Q, R, S, T on the circle. The angle at S between P and R. So, from S, connecting to P and R. The arc that is intercepted would be arc PR that does not include S. As mentioned before, that arc is 144°, hence angle is 72°. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to compute it. For example, using the formula for the internal angles of a cyclic polygon. 

Wait, but for a cyclic polygon, the internal angles can be related to the arcs. For a cyclic polygon with n sides, each internal angle can be computed based on the arcs. 

For a cyclic pentagon, each internal angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, no. Wait, in general, for a cyclic polygon, each internal angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Actually, for a cyclic polygon, the internal angle at a vertex is half the difference between the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, no. Let me recall. 

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary. Each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no. For a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, angle A is half the measure of arc BCD. Similarly, angle B is half arc CDA, etc. 

But for a pentagon, perhaps similar logic applies. For instance, the internal angle at vertex S would be half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it. Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, let me use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the points. But that might be complex. Alternatively, think about specific cases. 

Suppose the pentagon is regular. Then all arcs are 72°, and each internal angle is 108°, as in a regular pentagon. However, in our case, the pentagon is not necessarily regular, just equilateral. But since it's cyclic and equilateral, maybe there's some symmetry. 

But in the regular pentagon, angle PSR would be... Let's see. In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108°. But angle PSR is not an internal angle of the pentagon. Wait, the internal angle at S is angle TSQ? Wait, no. Wait, in the pentagon, the internal angles are at each vertex. For example, at S, the internal angle is angle RST. But the question asks for angle PSR, which is a different angle. 

Wait, so angle PSR is not an internal angle of the pentagon. It's an angle formed by connecting non-consecutive vertices. So, in the regular pentagon, what would angle PSR be? 

In a regular pentagon, let's label the points in order P, Q, R, S, T. So, connecting P to S would skip one vertex (Q and R). Connecting S to R is adjacent. So, angle at S between P and R. 

In a regular pentagon, the diagonals form various triangles. For example, triangle SPR. Let me calculate angle at S. 

In a regular pentagon, the length of the diagonal is φ times the side length, where φ is the golden ratio (~1.618). But how does that relate to the angle? 

Alternatively, using the central angles. In a regular pentagon, each central angle is 72°, as before. The arc from P to R is 2*72° = 144°, as before. Therefore, the inscribed angle over arc PR is half that, 72°, so angle PSR would be 72°, same as before. 

But in a regular pentagon, what is the actual measure of angle PSR? Let me think. In a regular pentagon, the internal angle at each vertex is 108°, but angle PSR is formed by two diagonals. 

Wait, in a regular pentagon, the diagonals create angles of 36°, 72°, etc. For example, the angle between a side and a diagonal is 36°, since the internal angle is 108°, and the diagonal splits it into parts. 

But if angle PSR is formed by two diagonals, like SP and SR. In the regular pentagon, SP and SR are both diagonals. What is the angle between them at S? 

Alternatively, considering triangle SPR. In a regular pentagon, triangle SPR is an isosceles triangle with SP = SR (since they're both diagonals). The base angles would be equal. 

But perhaps it's easier to use the central angles. Arc PR is 144°, so angle at center is 144°, and inscribed angle over arc PR is 72°, so angle PSR is 72°, which matches. 

Thus, in the regular pentagon case, angle PSR is 72°, which is option B. But the problem states that the pentagon is equilateral, not necessarily regular. However, in this case, since the pentagon is cyclic and equilateral, all sides are equal chords, implying equal arcs, hence the same as the regular pentagon. Therefore, the same reasoning applies. 

Therefore, regardless of whether it's regular or just equilateral and cyclic, the measure of angle PSR would still be 72°, making the answer B. 

But wait, another thought: if the pentagon is not regular, can the arcs between consecutive points be unequal? No, because the chords are equal. In a circle, equal chords correspond to equal arcs. Therefore, all arcs between consecutive points must be equal. Therefore, the arcs are all 72°, making the pentagon effectively regular in terms of arc lengths, even if the angles are not all equal. Wait, but in a regular pentagon, all arcs are equal, so it's both equilateral and equiangular. 

But if the pentagon is cyclic and equilateral, then it must be regular? Because equal chords imply equal arcs, so all arcs are equal, thus making it regular. Wait, but in that case, the pentagon would be regular. Therefore, angle PSR is 72°, so answer B. 

But why is there an option C (120°)? Could there be a misunderstanding in the intercepted arc? 

Wait, suppose instead that angle PSR intercepts a different arc. Let me re-examine. 

At point S, angle PSR is formed by lines SP and SR. The intercepted arc is the arc from P to R that does not include S. As established, that arc is 144°, giving angle 72°. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is actually an external angle or something else. 

Another approach: consider the entire circle. Let me calculate the measure of angle PSR using coordinates. 

Assume the circle has radius 1 for simplicity. Let me place point P at (1, 0). Then, since each arc between consecutive points is 72°, the next points can be placed accordingly. 

Coordinates:

- Point P: (cos(0°), sin(0°)) = (1, 0)
- Point Q: 72° counterclockwise: cos(72°), sin(72°)
- Point R: 144°: cos(144°), sin(144°)
- Point S: 216°: cos(216°), sin(216°)
- Point T: 288°: cos(288°), sin(288°)

Then, angle PSR is the angle at point S between points P, S, R. 

To find this angle, we can compute vectors SP and SR, then find the angle between them. 

First, compute coordinates:

Point S is at 216°, which is equivalent to -144° (since 216° - 360° = -144°). Cos(216°) = cos(180°+36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090; sin(216°) = -sin(36°) ≈ -0.5878.

Point P is at (1, 0).

Vector SP is P - S: (1 - (-0.8090), 0 - (-0.5878)) = (1 + 0.8090, 0 + 0.5878) ≈ (1.8090, 0.5878)

Vector SR is R - S: coordinates of R are cos(144°), sin(144°). cos(144°) = cos(180°-36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090; sin(144°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878.

So vector SR is R - S: (-0.8090 - (-0.8090), 0.5878 - (-0.5878))? Wait, no. Wait, vector SR is from S to R, so coordinates of R minus coordinates of S.

So coordinates of R: x = cos(144°) ≈ -0.8090, y = sin(144°) ≈ 0.5878

Coordinates of S: x = cos(216°) ≈ -0.8090, y = sin(216°) ≈ -0.5878

Therefore, vector SR is R - S: (-0.8090 - (-0.8090), 0.5878 - (-0.5878)) → (0, 1.1756)

Vector SP is P - S: (1 - (-0.8090), 0 - (-0.5878)) → (1.8090, 0.5878)

Now, to find the angle between vectors SP and SR. 

The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)

Compute the dot product:

u · v = (1.8090)(0) + (0.5878)(1.1756) ≈ 0 + 0.5878 * 1.1756 ≈ approx 0.5878 * 1.1756. Let me calculate:

First, note that 0.5878 is approximately sin(36°), and 1.1756 is approximately 2*sin(36°), since 2*sin(36°) ≈ 2*0.5878 ≈ 1.1756. Therefore, their product is approx 0.5878 * 1.1756 ≈ 0.5878*(2*sin(36°)) = 2*sin²(36°). 

What's 2*sin²(36°)? Using the identity sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2, so 2*sin²(x) = 1 - cos(2x). Here x=36°, so 2x=72°, so 2*sin²(36°)=1 - cos(72°). 

cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, so 1 - 0.3090 ≈ 0.691. 

So the dot product is approximately 0.691. 

Now, compute |u| and |v|. 

Vector u (SP): magnitude squared is (1.809)^2 + (0.5878)^2. Let me approximate:

1.809^2 ≈ 3.272, 0.5878^2 ≈ 0.3457. Sum ≈ 3.272 + 0.3457 ≈ 3.6177. Square root is approx 1.902. 

Vector v (SR): magnitude is sqrt(0^2 + (1.1756)^2) = 1.1756. 

Therefore, cosθ ≈ 0.691 / (1.902 * 1.1756). Compute denominator: 1.902 * 1.1756 ≈ approx 2.237. 

So cosθ ≈ 0.691 / 2.237 ≈ 0.309. 

Looking up arccos(0.309), which is approximately 72°, since cos(60°)=0.5, cos(90°)=0, so 0.309 is closer to 72°, since cos(72°)≈0.3090. 

Therefore, angle θ ≈ 72°, confirming our previous conclusion. 

Thus, angle PSR is 72°, so the answer is B. 

But wait, another possibility: if the intercepted arc was the larger arc PR (216°), then the inscribed angle would be half of that, which is 108°, but that contradicts the calculation. However, since the angle is formed at S, and the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain S. Since the arc PR that contains S would be the longer arc. Wait, but how do we know which arc is intercepted?

In the case of angle PSR, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, i.e., not containing the vertex. So, since the pentagon is labeled sequentially, the arc PR that does not pass through S is the minor arc PR (144°), whereas the arc that passes through S is the major arc PR (216°). Therefore, the inscribed angle is half of the minor arc, which is 72°, as previously determined. 

Hence, the correct answer is B. 

I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. All approaches—central angles, inscribed angles, coordinate calculation—lead to 72°. Therefore, the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle PSR $ in the given scenario, we begin by analyzing the structure of the geometric configuration:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are given:
- An **equilateral** pentagon $ PQRST $, which implies **all sides are congruent**.
- This pentagon is **cyclic**, meaning all its vertices lie on a single circle $ \odot U $.
  
This combination of properties leads to important implications:
- In a **circle**, **equal chords** subtend **equal arcs**.
- Since all sides of the pentagon are equal, the arcs between consecutive vertices must be equal.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Measure of the Intercepted Arc**

With the pentagon inscribed in a circle, the total circumference of the circle is $ 360^\circ $. Dividing this among the 5 equal arcs yields:

$$
\text{Arc between each pair of consecutive vertices} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
$$

Thus, the arc from $ P $ to $ Q $, $ Q $ to $ R $, and so on, each measures $ 72^\circ $.

Now, focus on the angle $ \angle PSR $, which is at vertex $ S $, formed by the chords $ SP $ and $ SR $. This is an **inscribed angle** that intercepts the arc $ PR $ that **does not contain** point $ S $.

From the sequence $ P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R \rightarrow S \rightarrow T \rightarrow P $, the arc from $ P $ to $ R $ that **does not include** point $ S $ consists of two arcs:
- From $ P $ to $ Q $: $ 72^\circ $
- From $ Q $ to $ R $: $ 72^\circ $

Total arc $ PR $: $ 72^\circ + 72^\circ = 144^\circ $

---

### **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

By the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, the measure of an inscribed angle is **half the measure of its intercepted arc**. Therefore,

$$
m\angle PSR = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } PR = \frac{1}{2} \times 144^\circ = 72^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All steps consistently lead to the conclusion that the measure of $ \angle PSR $ is:

$$
\boxed{72^\circ}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**
Final Answer: B
