====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral DEFG that's a rectangle. The question gives us some angle measures involving angles at point F. Specifically, they mention m∠EFD = 2x - 3 and m∠DFG = x + 12. We need to find the measure of ∠EFD.

First, I should recall the properties of a rectangle. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. But wait, hold on—there's something else here. Wait, maybe there's more to it because the problem mentions specific angles. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. So, all four angles in a rectangle are 90 degrees. However, the problem also gives two angles: ∠EFD and ∠DFG. Hmm, but these angles might not necessarily be the standard 90-degree angles unless they're referring to specific corners.

Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me label the points properly. Since it's a rectangle named DEFG, the order of the letters matters. So, the vertices are D connected to E, E connected to F, F connected to G, and G connected back to D. So, the rectangle has sides DE, EF, FG, GD. 

Now, looking at the angles mentioned: ∠EFD and ∠DFG. Let's break down each angle:

- ∠EFD is the angle at point F between points E, F, D. So, vertex at F, with segments FE and FD. Wait, but in the rectangle, point F is connected to E and G. Wait, so FE is one side (since E-F is a side), and FD would be another segment? Wait, no. Wait, in the rectangle, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So, point F is connected to E and G. Therefore, the sides adjacent to F are FE and FG. So, the angle at F between E and G is the internal angle of the rectangle, which is 90 degrees. But the problem is talking about ∠EFD, which is the angle at F between E and D. Wait, but D is not directly connected to F. Because in the rectangle, D is connected to E and G. So, FD is a diagonal?

Wait, perhaps I need to draw this mentally. Let me sketch the rectangle mentally. Points D, E, F, G arranged such that DEFG is a rectangle. So, starting from D, moving to E, then to F, then to G, then back to D. So, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. Therefore, the diagonals would be DF and EG. So, connecting D to F and E to G.

So, in this case, ∠EFD is the angle at point F formed by points E, F, D. That is, at point F, with segments FE and FD. So, FE is one side of the rectangle (from F to E), and FD is a diagonal from F to D. Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at point F between points D, F, G. So, FD and FG. Since FG is a side of the rectangle (from F to G), and FD is the diagonal from F to D.

Therefore, both angles ∠EFD and ∠DFG are angles at point F, but one involves a side and a diagonal, and the other involves a diagonal and a side. Also, since the rectangle's angles are all 90 degrees, but these angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle. Instead, they are angles formed by the diagonals with the sides.

So, let's consider triangle EFD. Wait, but point D is connected to F via the diagonal. So, triangle EFD has vertices at E, F, D. Similarly, triangle DFG has vertices D, F, G.

But how can we relate these angles? Let's think about the properties of rectangles and their diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. Also, the diagonals create congruent triangles. Moreover, each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles. Also, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they aren't perpendicular unless it's a square.

However, in this case, since we have angles involving the diagonals, maybe we can use properties of triangles or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since the problem gives us expressions for two angles (∠EFD and ∠DFG) and asks for the value of ∠EFD, perhaps we can set up equations based on the fact that those angles are related through the triangle or through supplementary angles.

Let me think. At point F, there are several angles. The internal angle of the rectangle at F is 90 degrees. This internal angle is between sides EF and FG. However, the angles ∠EFD and ∠DFG are different. Let me see: ∠EFD is between FE and FD, and ∠DFG is between FD and FG. So, adding those two angles together, ∠EFD + ∠DFG should equal the internal angle at F of the rectangle, which is 90 degrees. Is that correct?

Yes! Because at point F, the total around that point is 360 degrees, but considering just the angles formed by the diagonal FD splitting the corner. The original internal angle is between FE and FG (which is 90 degrees). When you draw the diagonal FD, it splits that 90-degree angle into two parts: ∠EFD and ∠DFG. Therefore, ∠EFD + ∠DFG = 90 degrees.

Therefore, we can write:

(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90

Combine like terms:

2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90  
(2x + x) + (-3 + 12) = 90  
3x + 9 = 90  

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 81  

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 27

Then, substitute back into m∠EFD = 2x - 3:

2*(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 51. So, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my reasoning.

Wait, why did I assume that ∠EFD + ∠DFG equals 90 degrees? Let me confirm that.

At point F, the original angle of the rectangle is between FE and FG, which is 90 degrees. Drawing diagonal FD splits that angle into two angles: one between FE and FD (∠EFD) and another between FD and FG (∠DFG). Therefore, yes, they add up to the original 90 degrees. So that equation is valid.

So solving that equation gives x=27, leading to ∠EFD being 51 degrees. Which matches answer choice A. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check if there's any possibility that the angles could be something else. For example, maybe there's a different configuration? Or maybe I made a mistake in identifying the angles?

Another way to approach this: using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle to verify.

Assume rectangle DEFG with coordinates. Let me place point D at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose DE is along the x-axis, DG is along the y-axis. Then:

- Point D: (0, 0)
- Point E: (a, 0) for some a > 0
- Point F: (a, b) for some b > 0
- Point G: (0, b)

So, the sides are DE: from (0,0) to (a,0); EF: from (a,0) to (a,b); FG: from (a,b) to (0,b); GD: from (0,b) to (0,0).

Wait, no, FG should go from F(a,b) to G(0,b)? No, wait, in the rectangle, after F comes G, then back to D. So, FG connects F(a,b) to G, then GD connects G to D(0,0). So, G should be at (0,b). Therefore, FG goes from (a,b) to (0,b), which is horizontal line leftward. Then GD is vertical down from (0,b) to (0,0).

So, in this setup, point F is at (a,b). Now, let's compute the angles ∠EFD and ∠DFG.

First, ∠EFD is the angle at F between points E, F, D. So, vectors FE and FD.

Vector FE is from F to E: E - F = (a,0) - (a,b) = (0, -b).

Vector FD is from F to D: D - F = (0,0) - (a,b) = (-a, -b).

To find the angle between vectors FE and FD.

Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at F between D, F, G. Vector FD and vector FG.

Vector FG is from F to G: G - F = (0,b) - (a,b) = (-a, 0).

So, let's calculate ∠EFD first.

The angle between FE (vector (0,-b)) and FD (vector (-a,-b)). Let's compute the angle between these two vectors.

Using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (FE • FD) / (|FE| |FD|)

Compute FE • FD = (0)(-a) + (-b)(-b) = 0 + b² = b²

|FE| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = b

|FD| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²)

Thus,

cosθ = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, θ = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²))

Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle between FD and FG.

Vector FD is (-a, -b), vector FG is (-a, 0).

Dot product FD • FG = (-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a² + 0 = a²

|FD| is same as before: sqrt(a² + b²)

|FG| = sqrt( (-a)^2 + 0^2 ) = a

Thus,

cosφ = a² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * a ] = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, φ = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²))

So, note that θ and φ are complementary angles because:

If we take tanθ = opposite/adjacent. From the earlier calculation, cosθ = b / sqrt(a² + b²), so sinθ = a / sqrt(a² + b²), so tanθ = (sinθ)/(cosθ) = (a/b). Wait, no:

Wait, if cosθ = adjacent/hypotenuse = b / sqrt(a² + b²), then adjacent is b, hypotenuse sqrt(a² + b²), so opposite is a. Thus, tanθ = opposite/adjacent = a/b. Therefore, θ = arctan(a/b). Similarly, φ = arccos(a / sqrt(...)), which would correspond to tanφ = b/a. Therefore, θ + φ = arctan(a/b) + arctan(b/a). 

But arctan(x) + arctan(1/x) = π/2 radians (90 degrees) when x > 0. Therefore, θ + φ = 90 degrees. Hence, confirming our previous conclusion that ∠EFD + ∠DFG = 90 degrees. Therefore, regardless of the rectangle's dimensions, those two angles add up to 90 degrees. Thus, the initial equation holds.

Hence, solving (2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90 leads to x = 27, and substituting back into 2x - 3 gives 51 degrees. Therefore, answer A is correct.

But let me check once again if there's a possible error in interpreting the angles. Suppose someone thought that ∠DFG was something else, but according to the coordinates, ∠DFG is indeed the angle between FD and FG, which we've confirmed adds up with ∠EFD to 90 degrees.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the notation of the angles?

For instance, ∠EFD is the angle at F, between E-F-D. So, yes, that's the angle between FE and FD. And ∠DFG is angle at F between D-F-G, i.e., between FD and FG. So, yes, they sum to 90 degrees. 

So, the math checks out. Therefore, the answer should be A. 51 degrees. So the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle EFD $, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure of the rectangle $ DEFG $. All internal angles in a rectangle are right angles, so $ \angle EFG = 90^\circ $. Importantly, the diagonal $ DF $ splits the right angle at vertex $ F $ into two smaller angles: $ \angle EFD $ and $ \angle DFG $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

We are told:
- $ m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 $
- $ m\angle DFG = x + 12 $

Since the diagonal $ DF $ creates two adjacent angles at point $ F $, the **sum** of these two angles must equal the original right angle at $ F $, which is $ 90^\circ $:

$$
m\angle EFD + m\angle DFG = 90^\circ
$$

Substitute the given expressions:

$$
(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90 \\
3x + 9 = 90 \\
3x = 81 \\
x = 27
$$

---

### Step 3: Find $ m\angle EFD $

Substitute $ x = 27 $ into the expression for $ m\angle EFD $:

$$
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 = 2(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51
$$

---

### Final Verification

This solution aligns with the geometric property that the diagonal in a rectangle divides the right angle into two parts whose sum is always $ 90^\circ $. Furthermore, the derived value of $ 51^\circ $ corresponds to one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{A}
