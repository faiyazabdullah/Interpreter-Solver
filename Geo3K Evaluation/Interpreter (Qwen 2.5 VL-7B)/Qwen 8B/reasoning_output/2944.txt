====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. So first, I need to recall the properties of a rectangle. From what I remember, a rectangle is a type of parallelogram where all angles are right angles. That means each angle in a rectangle measures 90 degrees. Wait, but then there's mention of angles 1 and 2. Hmm, maybe those aren't the usual angles of the rectangle?

Wait, the question mentions angle 1 has a measure of 30 degrees. But if it's a rectangle, all angles should be 90 degrees. There's something conflicting here. Maybe angle 1 isn't one of the internal angles of the rectangle? Let me check the problem again.

Looking at the constraints given:

- Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z): So WXYZ is a rectangle. Then the angles at each corner (W, X, Y, Z) are right angles. So angles at W, X, Y, Z are all 90 degrees each.

But then there's talk about Angle(1) and Angle(2). Maybe these are angles formed by diagonals? Because sometimes when you draw diagonals in a rectangle, they create triangles with different angles.

Let me think. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. Also, the diagonals split the rectangle into two congruent triangles. If we consider diagonal lines, for example, connecting W to Y and X to Z. So the diagonals intersect at some point, say O. When they intersect, they form vertical angles. 

If angle 1 is one of those angles formed by the intersection of diagonals, then perhaps angle 1 is part of triangle formed by half-diagonals and sides. For instance, if angle 1 is at the intersection point of the diagonals, then depending on which angle it is, maybe it relates to the original angles of the rectangle.

Wait, but the problem states that Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)), etc. Wait, no, looking back, the constraints include:

Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)) – but since WXYZ is a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So line WX is horizontal, line XY is vertical, etc. So lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, hence parallel. Therefore, they can't be perpendicular unless the rectangle is degenerate. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in reading the constraints?

Wait, the user wrote:

Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z))

Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So lines WX and YZ are both horizontal (assuming standard position), so they are parallel. Hence, they cannot be perpendicular. This suggests that maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using some non-standard notation or there's a typo?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the diagonals being perpendicular? Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but if the diagonals were perpendicular, then the rectangle would have to be a square. However, the problem says it's just a rectangle. So maybe there's confusion here.

Wait, the problem also includes IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,X)...). Wait, no. Looking back at the constraints:

IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,X)
IsDiagonalOf(Line(Y,Z)
IsDiagonalOf(Line(X,Y)
IsDiagonalOf(Line(Z,W)

Wait, that might mean that lines WX, YZ, XY, ZW are diagonals? But that can't be because in a rectangle, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So normally, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. So lines WX, XY, YZ, ZW are sides, not diagonals. So maybe the problem has some errors or misstatements?

This is getting confusing. Let me try to parse the problem again carefully.

The problem starts by saying Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. Then it lists several constraints:

- Right angles at W, X, Y, Z. So that's consistent with a rectangle.

Then:

Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)): Wait, if WXYZ is a rectangle, then line WX is parallel to line YZ, as opposite sides. So they can't be perpendicular. Unless the rectangle is collapsed into a line, which is impossible. So this seems like a contradiction. Similarly, Perpendicular(Line(X,Y), Line(Z,W)): Again, line XY is parallel to line ZW, so same issue.

So this suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or perhaps the lines mentioned are not the sides but something else? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the lines mentioned are not the entire side but parts of them? For example, maybe Line(W,X) refers to a segment, and Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)) could refer to the segments being perpendicular. But in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So for example, Line(W,X) is one side, Line(X,Y) is another side, which are perpendicular. But the problem says Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)). So that would imply that line WX is perpendicular to line YZ. Which in a rectangle, since WX and YZ are opposite sides, they are parallel, not perpendicular. Therefore, this seems inconsistent.

Hmm. This is very confusing. Maybe the problem is trying to indicate that the figure is a rectangle, and the angles mentioned are not the internal angles but angles formed by diagonals?

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and meant to say that certain lines are perpendicular. For example, perhaps the diagonals are perpendicular? But in a general rectangle, diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Since the problem gives angle 1 as 30 degrees, which suggests that it's not a square, since in a square, the diagonals would form 45-degree angles.

Wait, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then maybe angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Let me think. Suppose we have a rectangle, with diagonals intersecting at point O. Then the diagonals divide each other into halves. The triangles formed would be congruent. The angles formed at the intersection depend on the rectangle's aspect ratio.

For example, suppose the rectangle has length longer than width. Then the diagonals would form angles that are acute and obtuse. Let me visualize: in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. If we denote the rectangle's sides as length a and b. The diagonals would have length sqrt(a² + b²). At the point where diagonals intersect, the angle between the diagonals can be calculated using trigonometry.

Suppose we take triangle formed by half of the diagonal, half of the diagonal, and a side. Wait, actually, the angle between the diagonals can be found by considering the triangle formed by the center of the rectangle and two adjacent vertices. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the angle between the diagonals.

Alternatively, think of the angle between the diagonals. For instance, if we have a rectangle with sides of lengths a and b, then the diagonals make angles θ with the horizontal axis, where tanθ = b/a. However, the angle between the two diagonals would be 2θ if we're talking about the angle between them when they cross. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between the two diagonals would be 2 times the angle between one diagonal and the horizontal, assuming symmetry.

Wait, let me calculate. Suppose we have a rectangle with sides of length a (horizontal) and b (vertical). The diagonal makes an angle θ with the horizontal, where tanθ = b/a. The other diagonal is symmetric, going from top-left to bottom-right. The angle between the two diagonals would be 2θ or π - 2θ, depending on which angle we take. But in reality, the angle between the diagonals would be determined by the slopes of the diagonals.

Alternatively, the angle between the diagonals can be found using vectors. The diagonals are vectors (a, b) and (-a, b), assuming one diagonal goes from (0,0) to (a,b), and the other from (a,0) to (0,b). Wait, maybe not. Let me define coordinates.

Let’s place the rectangle with points W(0,0), X(a,0), Y(a,b), Z(0,b). Then the diagonals are from W(0,0) to Y(a,b) and from X(a,0) to Z(0,b). The slope of diagonal WY is (b-0)/(a-0) = b/a. The slope of diagonal XZ is (b-0)/(0-a) = -b/a. The angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by:

tanφ = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

Here, m1 = b/a, m2 = -b/a.

Thus,

tanφ = |(-b/a - b/a)/(1 + (b/a)(-b/a))| = |(-2b/a)/(1 - b²/a²)| = | (-2b/a ) / ((a² - b²)/a² ) | = | (-2b/a * a²/(a² - b²) ) | = | -2ab / (a² - b²) | = 2ab / |a² - b²|

Therefore, φ = arctan(2ab / |a² - b²| )

Now, if angle 1 is one of these angles φ, then depending on the value of a and b, φ varies. Given that angle 1 is 30 degrees, we can set up an equation.

Assume angle 1 is φ = 30°, so:

tan(30°) = 2ab / |a² - b²|

But tan(30°) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.

So:

1/√3 = 2ab / |a² - b²|

But without knowing the specific values of a and b, how do we find angle 2? Wait, the problem mentions angle 2. What is angle 2?

Possibly, angle 2 is the other angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Since the sum of angles around a point is 360°, and the diagonals intersect forming two pairs of vertical angles. So if one angle is 30°, its vertical angle is also 30°, and the other pair would be 180° - 30° = 150°. But the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1), MeasureOf(Angle(2))? Wait, the question says "Find the measure of ∠2 if m∠1 = 30."

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary? Like if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 2 is 180° - 30° = 150°, but none of the answer choices include 150°. However, looking at the answer choices, the options are 30, 60, 90, 120. So 150 isn't there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are angles inside the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, in one of the triangles formed by a diagonal, there are angles. Let's think. If we take triangle WXY, but wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals split it into four triangles. Each triangle has angles related to the rectangle's sides.

Alternatively, suppose angle 1 is one of the base angles in a triangle formed by the diagonal. Let me take triangle WXY. Wait, no, in a rectangle, the diagonals split it into two congruent triangles. For example, triangle WXY is not a triangle; the diagonal divides it into two triangles. Let's say diagonal WY splits the rectangle into triangles WXY and WYZ. In triangle WXY, the angles would be at W, X, and Y. But angle at X is 90°, and the other angles depend on the triangle's proportions.

Wait, maybe angle 1 is one of the acute angles in triangle formed by the diagonal. For example, in triangle WXY (assuming diagonal WY), the triangle has sides of length a, b, and diagonal sqrt(a² + b²). The angles of this triangle can be calculated using trigonometric ratios.

In triangle WXY, angle at W is 90°, but wait no—wait, in the rectangle, angle at X is 90°, but if we consider triangle WXY, which is actually not a right triangle. Wait, no. Wait, W is connected to X and Y via the diagonal. Let me clarify.

Actually, the diagonal connects W to Y. So in triangle WXY, the sides are WX (length a), XY (length b), and WY (diagonal). This triangle is not a right triangle unless it's a square. Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonal creates a right triangle with sides a and b. So triangle WXY is actually not a triangle, since W, X, Y are three consecutive vertices of the rectangle. Wait, no. W is connected to X and Z. Y is connected to X and Z. So if we draw diagonal WY, then triangle WXY consists of points W, X, Y. But in the rectangle, angle at X is 90°, and sides WX and XY are perpendicular. So triangle WXY is a right triangle with legs WX and XY, and hypotenuse WY. So yes, it's a right triangle. Thus, the angles at W and Y are acute angles.

In such a right triangle, the angles can be calculated. For example, angle at W is opposite to side XY (which has length b), and adjacent to side WX (length a). So tan(angle at W) = opposite/adjacent = b/a. Similarly, angle at Y would be complementary to angle at W.

If angle 1 is one of these angles, say angle at W, then tan(angle 1) = b/a. Given that angle 1 is 30°, then tan(30°) = b/a → b/a = 1/√3 → a/b = √3. So the rectangle is such that the length is √3 times the width.

Now, what about angle 2? If angle 2 is the other acute angle in the triangle, which would be angle at Y. Since in a right triangle, the two acute angles add up to 90°, so if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 2 would be 60°, which is option B. Alternatively, if angle 2 refers to another angle, like the angle formed by the diagonal and the side, but that's already covered.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to an angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Earlier calculation showed that the angle between the diagonals depends on the rectangle's dimensions. If angle 1 is one of those angles, say φ = 30°, then the other angle would be 180° - φ = 150°, but that's not among the options. However, if angle 1 is one of the acute angles in the triangle formed by the diagonal, then angle 2 could be the other angle in that triangle, which is 60°, matching option B.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is the angle between the diagonal and the side, which would be the complement of angle 1. For example, if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 2 would be 60°, since they are complementary in the right triangle.

Given the answer choices include B. 60, which fits this scenario, it seems likely that the answer is B.

But let me verify once more. Suppose angle 1 is 30°, which is one of the acute angles in the right triangle formed by the diagonal. Then the other acute angle is 60°, which would be angle 2. So the answer is B. 60 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 2$ given that $m\angle 1 = 30^\circ$ and quadrilateral $WXYZ$ is a rectangle, we begin by analyzing the structure and properties of the rectangle.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Rectangle

A **rectangle** is defined as a quadrilateral with:
- All interior angles equal to $90^\circ$
- Opposite sides equal and parallel
- Diagonals equal in length and bisect each other

However, the problem introduces **angles 1 and 2**, which are **not** the standard internal angles of the rectangle. Instead, these are **angles formed within triangles created by the diagonals** of the rectangle.

---

### Step 2: Consider the Triangle Formed by the Diagonal

When the diagonals of a rectangle intersect, they divide the rectangle into **four congruent right triangles**. Consider one such triangle — for example, triangle $WXY$, where:
- $WX$ and $XY$ are sides of the rectangle
- $WY$ is the diagonal

Since the rectangle has right angles at each vertex, triangle $WXY$ is a **right triangle** with:
- Right angle at $X$
- Legs: $WX$ and $XY$
- Hypotenuse: $WY$

Let’s label the angles of this triangle:
- Let $\angle 1$ be the angle at vertex $W$
- Let $\angle 2$ be the angle at vertex $Y$

These two angles ($\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$) are the **acute angles** of the right triangle and thus **complementary**. That is:

$$
\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
$$

We are told that $m\angle 1 = 30^\circ$. Substituting:

$$
30^\circ + \angle 2 = 90^\circ \Rightarrow \angle 2 = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

Based on the geometric relationships within the right triangle formed by the diagonal of the rectangle, and using the fact that the two acute angles in a right triangle are **complementary**, we conclude that:

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
