MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P. Points J, K, L, M, N are mentioned. The lines NP and PL are drawn, and it says that NP is perpendicular to PL. Also, angle MPL is 65 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc NJK.

First, I should probably sketch a diagram based on the description. Let me visualize circle P. Since NP is perpendicular to PL, that means line NP forms a right angle with line PL at point P. Wait, but NP is a line from N to P, and PL is another line from P to L. So, they meet at point P, forming a right angle. Therefore, NP ⊥ PL implies that angle NPL is 90 degrees.

Now, there's an angle MPL given as 65 degrees. Point M is somewhere on the circle? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, angle MPL – so points M, P, L. Since P is the center, then PM and PL would be radii if M and L are on the circle. But wait, the problem mentions arc NJK. Points J, K are also on the circle because of the Arc(N,J,K). So, N, J, K are points on the circle centered at P. 

Let me think again. Since NP is a line from N to P (which is the center), so N lies on the circle because PN is a radius. Similarly, since PL is a line from P to L, L must be another point on the circle. So, points N and L are both on the circle with center P. Then, since NP is perpendicular to PL, those two radii form a right angle. That means that the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees, which would correspond to an arc between N and L. Wait, the arc from N to L would be 90 degrees because the central angle is 90 degrees. So arc NL measures 90 degrees.

But the question asks for arc NJK. Hmm. So points J and K are also on the circle. The arc from N to J to K. So maybe J and K are points such that when you connect them through the arc, it passes through J and K? Wait, the notation Arc(N,J,K) usually refers to the arc starting at N, passing through J, and ending at K. So, the arc NJK would be the measure of that arc.

So, how do we relate angle MPL to arc NJK?

Given that angle MPL is 65 degrees. Let me recall that angles formed by chords can relate to arcs. For instance, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, angle MPL – let's see. Point M is involved here. Is M on the circle? The problem states that MeasureOf(Arc(N,J,K)), but does not specify where M is. Wait, the original problem mentions Angle(M,P,L, 65). So, angle at point P between points M, P, L. Wait, no. In standard notation, angle MPL would be the angle at point P between points M, P, L. Wait, but angle at P? If that's the case, then angle MPL is at point P. Wait, but if that's the case, then MP and LP are two sides of the angle. But since P is the center, then MP and LP are radii only if M and L are on the circle. But the problem didn't explicitly say that M is on the circle. Wait, but given that there's an arc NJK, and points J and K are on the circle, but M isn't specified yet. Maybe M is also on the circle?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me re-express the given information:

- Circle P: So, P is the center of the circle. Points N, J, K, L are on the circle because they are connected via lines from P (NP, PL, etc.) and arcs. So, N and L are definitely on the circle. Points J and K are on the circle as well, since there's an arc NJK.

- Line NP: This connects N to P. Since P is the center, NP is a radius. So N is on the circle.

- Line PL: Connects P to L, so L is on the circle.

- RightAngle(Line(NP), Line(PL)): So, NP ⊥ PL. So, the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees. Which makes sense since they are radii forming a right angle. Thus, arc from N to L is 90 degrees.

- Angle(M, P, L): This is angle at point P between points M, P, L. Wait, that would mean angle at P between PM and PL. But angle MPL would typically be angle at P, unless written differently. Wait, the notation might vary. Sometimes angle ABC is the angle at point B. So, angle MPL would be angle at point P. So, ∠MPL is the angle at P between points M, P, L. So, that angle is 65 degrees. So, if that's the case, then PM and PL are two lines from P, making a 65-degree angle. But since PL is already part of the previous right angle with NP. Wait, earlier we had that NP is perpendicular to PL, meaning that angle NPL is 90 degrees. Now, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So, if we consider point M such that angle MPL is 65 degrees, then PM is another radius? Because P is the center. So, if M is on the circle, then PM is a radius. Therefore, PM and PL are two radii forming a 65-degree angle. So, the arc from M to L would be twice that angle? Wait, no. If angle at the center is 65 degrees, then the arc measure would be equal to the central angle. So, arc ML would be 65 degrees.

But then how does this relate to arc NJK?

We need to find arc NJK. Let's think about the positions of these points.

Since NP is perpendicular to PL, that gives us that arc NL is 90 degrees. Then, angle at P between PM and PL is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. Now, depending on where M is located relative to N and L, we might need to find some relationships.

But the arc NJK is from N to J to K. Wait, but without knowing where J and K are, how can we determine this? Unless there's more information. Wait, maybe J and K are related to the other points?

Alternatively, perhaps the arc NJK is the same as arc NM or something else. Wait, but the problem mentions arc NJK, so points N, J, K. Maybe J and K are points on the circle such that... perhaps J is where the angle bisector or something intersects? Not sure. Wait, maybe there's a missing piece here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says "Arc(N,J,K)". So, the arc starts at N, goes through J, and ends at K. So, the measure of that arc is the sum of the arcs from N to J and J to K. But without knowing specific positions, how can we compute that?

Alternatively, maybe J and K are points related to the angle given. Let me think again about the given angle MPL being 65 degrees. Since angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees, so that suggests that PM is a radius making a 65-degree angle with PL. So, if we imagine the circle with center P, with N and L separated by 90 degrees (since NP ⊥ PL). Then, point M is somewhere such that the angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. Depending on which side, M could be on one side or the other of PL. 

If we assume that the angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees, then depending on direction, the position of M would affect the arc measure. But perhaps we need to use the fact that the total around the circle is 360 degrees. Let me try to map out the positions.

Assume that the circle has center P. Let me place point N somewhere on the circle. Then, since NP is perpendicular to PL, point L is positioned such that PL is a radius perpendicular to NP. So, if NP is horizontal, then PL would be vertical. Let's fix coordinates for easier understanding. Suppose P is at origin (0,0). Let’s take N as (r, 0), so that NP is along the x-axis. Then, since NP is perpendicular to PL, PL would be along the y-axis. So, point L would be at (0, r) assuming radius r.

Now, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So, angle at P between points M, P, L. Since L is at (0, r), and angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So, PM is making a 65-degree angle with PL. Since PL is along positive y-axis, then PM would make 65 degrees from PL towards either clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's assume it's measured in the standard way. If we consider the angle between PM and PL (which is along positive y-axis) is 65 degrees, then PM could be in different directions.

For example, if we go clockwise from PL (positive y-axis) by 65 degrees, then PM would be pointing towards the fourth quadrant. Alternatively, going counterclockwise, it would be into the second quadrant. Depending on that, the position of M changes.

But how does this help us with finding arc NJK?

Wait, the arc NJK is given. Maybe J and K are intersections of certain lines? Wait, the problem statement includes Arc(N,J,K). So, J and K are points on the circle. Perhaps the arc NJK is determined by some construction involving other elements. However, the problem doesn't mention anything else about J and K except their inclusion in the arc. Maybe there's a missing detail?

Wait, perhaps the arc NJK is related to the angle given. For example, maybe J and K are points where some lines intersect? Like, if there's a triangle or something involving angle MPL?

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK corresponds to the angle at M? Wait, but angle at M would be an inscribed angle. Wait, but we don't know where M is. Wait, angle MPL is at P, not at M. So, angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees. So, PM is a radius making 65 degrees with PL.

Wait, if we can figure out where M is located relative to N and L, then maybe we can find relations between arcs.

Let me try to think of possible configurations. Let me suppose that the circle has points N, L, and M arranged such that:

- NP is horizontal (from center P to N).

- PL is vertical upward (since NP ⊥ PL).

Then, angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So, PM is at 65 degrees from PL. Since PL is upwards, then PM could be 65 degrees to the left or right of PL.

If we take PM to be 65 degrees clockwise from PL (which is up), then PM would be heading towards the fourth quadrant (if PL is up). So, from point P, moving 65 degrees below PL. But since PL is vertical, that would put PM in the lower half of the circle. Alternatively, if it's counterclockwise, then PM would be 65 degrees above PL, which would be into the upper half, but since PL is already at the top, adding another 65 degrees would overshoot?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact position. Let's assume that PL is along positive y-axis. Then, angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So, if we're measuring from PL to PM, then PM is at 65 degrees from PL. So, if we consider standard position, with PL along positive y-axis, then PM would be 65 degrees clockwise from PL (i.e., towards negative x-axis direction) or 65 degrees counterclockwise from PL (towards positive x-axis direction). 

But depending on which direction, the position of M varies. Let's assume that PM is in the counterclockwise direction from PL, so that M is in the upper half-circle. Wait, but PL is already at the top. Adding 65 degrees counterclockwise from PL would move PM further counterclockwise. Wait, if PL is straight up (along positive y-axis), then counterclockwise from PL would be towards the left (negative x-direction). So, PM would be in the second quadrant. Whereas clockwise from PL would be towards the right (positive x-direction), but that would be towards the first quadrant. 

But regardless, the key thing is that the arc from M to L would be 65 degrees, since the central angle between M and L is 65 degrees. So, arc ML = 65 degrees.

Earlier, we had arc NL = 90 degrees, since NP is perpendicular to PL. So, arc from N to L is 90 degrees.

Now, if we can relate arc NJK to these known arcs. But where are J and K?

Wait, the problem mentions Arc(N,J,K), so the arc starts at N, goes through J, then ends at K. Without more info, maybe J and K are points where PM intersects something? Or perhaps J and K are endpoints of arcs related to other angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and it's supposed to be arc NKJ or something else? Or perhaps the arc NJK is referring to some specific arc created by the angle or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says "MeasureOf(Arc(N,J,K))", which is asking for the measure of arc NJK. Given that, and knowing that arc NL is 90 degrees and arc ML is 65 degrees, perhaps there's a relationship between these arcs and arc NJK.

Wait, maybe arc NJK is the difference between arc NL and arc MK or something like that? Or maybe it's composed of multiple arcs. Alternatively, perhaps J and K are points where some constructed lines intersect the circle?

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is related to the angle at M. Wait, if there's a triangle or something involving angle at M. But without more details, this is hard.

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the minor arc from N to K passing through J. But again, without knowing where J and K are, how can we tell?

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Circle(P)
Point(J)
Point(K)
Point(L)
Point(M)
Point(N)
Line(N,P)
Line(P,L)
RightAngle(Line(N,P)
Angle(M,P,L, 65)
Arc(N,J,K)
MeasureOf(Arc(N,J,K)"

So, the Arc(N,J,K) is defined, but the rest of the points are given. The angle MPL is 65 degrees. So, maybe J and K are points on the circle such that the arc NJK relates to the angle at P?

Wait, perhaps the arc NJK is the arc that corresponds to the angle at M? For example, if there's an inscribed angle subtended by arc NJK. But angle at M is given as 65 degrees. Wait, angle MPL is at P, not at M. So, angle at M would be different.

Wait, if there's an inscribed angle subtending arc NJK, then its measure would be half the arc. But we don't have an inscribed angle given. However, we have a central angle at P of 65 degrees. 

Alternatively, since we have arc NL = 90°, and arc ML = 65°, then if we can find the position of K and J, maybe we can combine these.

Wait, if we consider the entire circle is 360°, and we know arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°, but how does that relate to arc NJK?

Alternatively, maybe arc NJK is the remaining arc after accounting for arc NL and arc ML? Let me think. Suppose that arc from N to L is 90°, and arc from M to L is 65°, so the arc from N to M would be arc NL minus arc ML, which is 90° - 65° = 25°. So, arc NM is 25°. If that's the case, then maybe arc NJK is related to arc NM?

But why would arc NJK be 25°? Unless J and K are points along arc NM. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the angle MPL. Earlier, I thought that angle MPL is at point P, but maybe it's at point M? Let me check the notation again. In standard notation, angle MPL would be angle at point P, with segments MP and LP. So, vertex at P. Hence, the angle between PM and PL at P is 65°. Therefore, arc ML is 65°, as previously established.

If that's the case, then the arc from M to L is 65°, and arc from N to L is 90°, as NP is perpendicular to PL.

Therefore, the arc from N to M would be arc NL minus arc ML, which is 90° - 65° = 25°, assuming that M is on the same side of PL as N. Wait, but depends on the direction.

Let me draw this mentally. Assume N is at (r, 0), L is at (0, r). Then, arc NL is 90°, going counterclockwise from N to L. Now, point M is such that angle at P between PM and PL is 65°, so PM is 65° away from PL. If PL is upwards (to L), then PM could be 65° clockwise from PL, placing M in the fourth quadrant, or 65° counterclockwise from PL, placing M in the second quadrant.

If M is in the second quadrant (counterclockwise from PL), then the arc from N to M would be arc NL (90°) plus arc LM (but wait, arc from N to M would depend on the direction). Wait, if M is in the second quadrant, then going from N (rightmost point) to M (upper left), the arc would pass through the upper half. So, the arc length from N to M would be 90° (NL) minus 65° (ML)? No, because arc ML is 65°, so if M is counterclockwise from L, then arc from N to M would be arc NL + arc LM? Wait, no. If M is counterclockwise from L, then from N to L is 90°, and then from L to M is 65°, so total arc from N to M would be 90° + 65° = 155°, assuming M is placed counterclockwise from L. Alternatively, if M is clockwise from L, then arc from N to M would be arc NL (90°) minus arc ML (65°), giving 25°. So, depending on where M is, arc NM is either 25° or 155°.

Now, the problem asks for arc NJK. Assuming that J and K are points on the circle, maybe J is N and K is M? No, because arc NJK would then be arc NM. But the notation Arc(N,J,K) suggests that J is a point between N and K on the arc. So, if arc NJK is arc from N to K passing through J, then if K is M, and J is somewhere in between, then arc NJK would be arc NM. But how do we know where J and K are?

Wait, maybe there's more to this. Since the problem mentions Arc(N,J,K), and the other points, maybe J and K are intersection points of some lines? Or perhaps it's related to the angle at M?

Alternatively, maybe there's a missing element where J and K are the feet of some constructions. For example, if there's a tangent or something. But the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, another approach: since the arc NJK is requested, and we know arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°, and perhaps the arc NJK is the complement of some other arc. For example, if arc NJK is the arc that corresponds to the angle at M.

Wait, if we consider that angle at M subtends arc JK. But without knowing where M is, this is tricky. However, if we assume that M is on the circle, then angle at M would be an inscribed angle. But angle at M is not given directly. Wait, the given angle is at P, not at M.

Alternatively, since angle at P between M and L is 65°, which defines arc ML as 65°, and arc NL is 90°, then the arc from N to M could be 25° or 155°, depending on direction. If we assume that arc NJK is the smaller arc, then it might be 25°, which is option A. Or if it's the larger arc, then 155°, which is option D.

But the problem says "arc NJK". Usually, unless specified otherwise, arcs are considered as the minor arc. So, if arc NJK is the minor arc, then it would be 25°, hence answer A. However, I need to verify this logic.

Wait, let me think again. If arc NL is 90°, and arc ML is 65°, and assuming M is in the direction opposite to L from N, then the arc from N to M would be 90° - 65° = 25°. So, if arc NJK is the arc from N to K passing through J, and if K is M, then arc NJK would be 25°. So, answer A.

But why would arc NJK be arc NM? Unless J is a point on arc NM. But without knowing specifics, this is speculative. However, given the lack of additional information, and the presence of angle MPL=65°, which relates to arc ML=65°, and arc NL=90°, leading to arc NM=25°, which may be the arc NJK.

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the arc that corresponds to the angle at M. If angle at M is something, but we don't have that. Wait, if there was an inscribed angle subtended by arc NJK, then its measure would be half the arc. But since we don't have that angle, maybe we can derive it from the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is supplementary to arc ML or something. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of it in terms of total circumference.

Total circle is 360°. If arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°, then depending on placement, other arcs can be calculated. But without knowing where J and K are, it's difficult. But since the problem provides arc NJK, and the answer choices include 25 and 155, which are complementary to each other (adding to 180), maybe the arc is 25° or 155°.

Another possibility: since angle at P between M and L is 65°, and NP is perpendicular to PL, then maybe the arc from N to M is 25°, and arc NJK is that same arc. Hence, answer A. 

Alternatively, if the arc NJK is the major arc, then it would be 360 - 25 = 335, which is not among the choices. So likely, it's the minor arc of 25°, making answer A.

Thus, I think the correct answer is A. 25 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

- **Circle Centered at $ P $**: All points $ N, L, M, J, K $ lie on the circle, making them points on the circumference.
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - $ \overline{NP} \perp \overline{PL} $: This indicates that $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $, so the arc $ \overset{\frown}{NL} $ corresponding to this right angle is $ 90^\circ $.
  - $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $: This angle is at the center $ P $, so it corresponds to the arc $ \overset{\frown}{ML} $. Therefore, the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{ML} = 65^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Central Angle Relationships**

From the above, we now know:

- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{NL} = 90^\circ $
- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{ML} = 65^\circ $

Now, to find the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{NJK} $, we examine the arc from $ N $ to $ K $, passing through $ J $.

This suggests that points $ N $, $ J $, and $ K $ define an arc that spans a portion of the circle, possibly overlapping with or being derived from the arcs we’ve already identified.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the Arc $ \overset{\frown}{NJK} $**

Assuming that the arc $ \overset{\frown}{NJK} $ is the arc from $ N $ to $ K $ that lies *between* $ N $ and $ L $, and considering the known arcs:

- From $ N $ to $ L $: $ 90^\circ $
- From $ L $ to $ M $: $ 65^\circ $

If point $ K $ lies *between* $ N $ and $ M $, then the arc $ \overset{\frown}{NK} $ is the portion of the arc from $ N $ to $ M $, excluding the arc from $ K $ to $ M $. However, since the arc from $ N $ to $ M $ is:

$$
\text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{NM} = \text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{NL} - \text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{LM} = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ
$$

Hence, the arc $ \overset{\frown}{NJK} $, which is the same as arc $ \overset{\frown}{NM} $, measures:

$$
\boxed{25^\circ}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**
$$
\text{Final Answer: A}
