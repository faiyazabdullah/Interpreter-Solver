MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to solve this trapezoid problem. Let me start by recalling what's given and what needs to be found. The question says that we have a trapezoid ABCD with S and T being midpoints of the legs. Wait, in trapezoids, the legs are the non-parallel sides, right? Or wait, actually, sometimes people refer to the two bases as the parallel sides. So maybe AD and BC are the legs here? Wait, but the problem mentions Line(A,D) and Line(B,C). Hmm. Let me clarify.

First, let me note down all the given information:

1. Trapezoid ABCD. So, it's a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. But since they mention midpoints of the legs, which in trapezoid terminology usually refers to the non-parallel sides. Wait, but sometimes the term "legs" can also refer to the two bases. Wait, no—usually, the legs are the non-parallel sides. Let me confirm that. In a tr'trapezoid, the bases are the two parallel sides, and the legs are the other two sides. So, for example, in trapezoid ABCD, if AB and CD are the bases (the parallel ones), then AD and BC would be the legs. But the problem states that S is the midpoint of Line(A,D) and T is the midpoint of Line(B,C). So S and T are midpoints of the legs AD and BC respectively. Then, ST is a line connecting these midpoints. 

Additionally, it's given that lines ST is parallel to lines AB and CD. Also, the length of ST equals 10, and CD equals 14. They also say that ST is the midsegment of the trapezoid. Wait, the midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment connecting the midpoints of the legs, and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. So the formula should be: length of midsegment = (AB + CD)/2. 

But let me check the given data again. It says that ST is equal in length to CD, which is 14? Wait no, the problem says CD=14, ST=10, and AB=2x. Wait, the problem says: "If CD = 14, ST = 10, and AB = 2x, find x." So according to the midsegment theorem, the length of the midsegment ST should be the average of the two bases AB and CD. Therefore, ST = (AB + CD)/2. 

So substituting the known values: 10 = (AB + 14)/2. Solving for AB gives AB = 10*2 -14 = 20 -14 = 6. But AB is given as 2x, so 2x = 6 → x = 3. So the answer would be B. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.

Wait, let me go through each part again. The problem says that S and T are midpoints of the legs. Since legs are AD and BC (assuming AB and CD are the bases). Then, the midsegment connects midpoints of the legs, which is ST. And according to the midsegment theorem, the length of the midsegment is indeed the average of the two bases. Therefore, ST = (AB + CD)/2. Given that ST is 10, CD is 14, so solving for AB gives AB = 2*ST - CD = 20 -14 = 6. Since AB = 2x, then x = 3. That seems straightforward. 

But let me check if there's any possibility that the problem might have different configurations. For example, could AB and CD be the legs instead? No, because if AB and CD were the legs, then they would be the non-parallel sides, but then the midsegment would connect midpoints of the legs, which are AB and CD. However, the midsegment in that case would be between AB and CD, but then if AB and CD are legs, they aren't necessarily parallel. Wait, but in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel. Wait, no, actually, trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides. Wait, but some definitions consider trapezoids to have at least one pair of parallel sides. So depending on the definition, but generally, in most cases, trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides. So if AB and CD are the bases (the parallel sides), then AD and BC are legs. So the midsegment ST connects midpoints of AD and BC. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines the legs as the bases? No, that wouldn't make sense. Legs are the non-parallel sides. So the key point is that the midsegment's length is the average of the two bases. Hence, regardless of which sides are which, as long as AB and CD are the two bases, then ST is the midsegment. 

Therefore, using the formula: ST = (AB + CD)/2. Plugging in numbers:

Given CD = 14, ST = 10. So,

10 = (AB + 14)/2 ⇒ AB = 20 - 14 = 6. Then AB is given as 2x, so 2x = 6 ⇒ x = 3. Therefore, the answer is B. 

Let me check if there's another way this could be approached. Suppose someone thought that ST was equal to CD, but the problem says ST = 10 and CD = 14. Wait, the problem says "Equals(LengthOf(Line(ST) Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)" — no, looking back at the original problem statement: 

The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Trapezoid(A,B,C,D)
IsMidpointOf(Point(S)
Line(A,D)
IsMidpointOf(Point(T)
Line(B,C)
Parallel(Line(ST)
Line(A,B)
Line(C,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(ST)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)
IsMidsegmentOf(Line(ST)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)
Equals(SumOf(LengthOf(Line(A,B)
LengthOf(Line(C,D)"

Hmm, perhaps the formatting is confusing. Let me parse the constraints again. Maybe the key points are:

- ST is parallel to AB and CD (since Parallel(Line(ST) Line(A,B) and Parallel(Line(ST) Line(C,D)). So ST is parallel to both AB and CD, meaning AB and CD are parallel. Thus confirming that AB and CD are the two bases of the trapezoid. 

Then, the length of ST is equal to the length of CD? Wait, no. The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(ST)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)" – perhaps that's a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem had more structure. Alternatively, perhaps the constraints include that ST is a midsegment, whose length is equal to the average of AB and CD. But in the problem statement, the user says that CD=14, ST=10, AB=2x. So the equation is 10=(AB+CD)/2. Which gives AB=6, leading to x=3. 

Another possible confusion: Could the problem state that ST is equal to CD? But no, the problem says CD=14, ST=10. So that's not the case. So the answer is B. 

I think my reasoning is solid here. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are given a **trapezoid** $ABCD$, with the following key properties:

- Points $S$ and $T$ are the **midpoints** of the **legs**, i.e., segments $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$.
- The segment $\overline{ST}$ is drawn **connecting the midpoints of the legs**.
- It is stated that $\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{AB}$ and $\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{CD}$, implying that $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}$, making them the **bases** of the trapezoid.
- Additionally, it is confirmed that $\overline{ST}$ is the **midsegment** of the trapezoid.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Midsegment Theorem**

In a trapezoid, the **length of the midsegment** connecting the midpoints of the legs is the **average of the lengths of the two bases**. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
\text{Length of } \overline{ST} = \frac{\text{Length of } \overline{AB} + \text{Length of } \overline{CD}}{2}
$$

From the problem, we are told:

- $\text{Length of } \overline{CD} = 14$
- $\text{Length of } \overline{ST} = 10$

Let us denote $\text{Length of } \overline{AB} = 2x$. Substituting into the formula:

$$
10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
20 = 2x + 14
$$

Subtract 14 from both sides:

$$
2x = 6
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = 3
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the value of $x$ is $3$, and the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

---

### Final Answer: B
