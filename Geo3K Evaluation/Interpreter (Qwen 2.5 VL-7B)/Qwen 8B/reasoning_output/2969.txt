MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have angle ABC measuring 70 degrees. The question is asking for the degree measure of the minor arc AC, which is denoted as x. There's also mention of a major arc ADC with measure y. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems because arcs and angles in circles often relate through specific theorems. Let me think... When you have an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, there's something about angles formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle—wait, but here we might be dealing with an inscribed angle or maybe an angle formed by a tangent?

Wait, the problem mentions angle ABC. So point B is probably on the circumference of the circle? Or maybe it's outside? Hmm. Since they're talking about arcs AC and ADC, points A, C, D are on the circle. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally.

Let me assume that points A, B, C, D are on a circle. But how exactly are they arranged? Since there's a major arc ADC, that suggests that points A, D, C are on the circle, with D being another point between A and C along the major arc. Wait, but the major arc ADC would mean that starting at A, going through D to C, making a larger arc than the minor arc AC. So the minor arc AC is just the shorter path between A and C, while the major arc ADC goes the long way around the circle passing through D.

Now, angle ABC is given as 70 degrees. So point B must be somewhere such that when connected to A and C, forms angle ABC. Depending on where B is located relative to the circle, this angle could be an inscribed angle, or maybe formed by two secants or something else.

Wait, if angle ABC is formed by two chords BA and BC, then according to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle ABC would be half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no—that applies when the vertex is outside the circle. Wait, let me recall:

If the vertex of the angle is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle, so the measure is half the intercepted arc. However, if the vertex is outside the circle, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the vertex is inside the circle, then the measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

So, first, I need to determine whether point B is inside, on, or outside the circle. The problem mentions angle ABC. Let's consider possible scenarios.

Since there's a major arc ADC, perhaps point B is outside the circle? Because otherwise, if B were on the circle, then angle ABC would intercept arc AC. But since there's a major arc ADC mentioned, maybe the angle ABC is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle. For example, if B is outside the circle, and BA and BC are secants intersecting the circle at A and C (and possibly other points). Wait, but in that case, the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Alternatively, if point B is on the circle, then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. Then, the measure of angle ABC would be half of arc AC. But in that case, the problem says that the minor arc AC is x. So if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then x would be 140 degrees. But wait, that would make the minor arc AC equal to 140 degrees, but that can't be because the minor arc should be less than 180 degrees. Wait, 140 is less than 180, so that's okay. But then why mention the major arc ADC? Maybe my assumption is wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe point B is inside the circle. If that's the case, then angle ABC would be formed by two chords intersecting at B, and the measure of the angle would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Let me check that again. Yes, if two chords intersect inside a circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

But in this case, angle ABC would intercept arcs AD and DC? Wait, no. Wait, if point B is inside the circle, and lines BA and BC are chords, then the intercepted arcs would be arc AC and arc... Wait, actually, when two chords intersect inside a circle, the angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no. Let me get precise.

Suppose two chords AB and CB intersect at point B inside the circle. Wait, but point B is the vertex of the angle. Wait, if angle ABC is formed by chords AB and BC, then those chords would intercept arcs AC and... Well, depending on where the point is. Wait, if point B is inside the circle, then angle ABC intercepts arcs AC and the opposite arc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps angle ABC is formed by two secants that intersect outside the circle. For instance, if point B is outside the circle, and BA and BC are two secants that intersect the circle at A and C, then the measure of angle ABC is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, it would be half the difference between the measure of the major arc AC and the minor arc AC. 

Given that, if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then:

measure of angle ABC = ½ (major arc AC - minor arc AC)

But the problem states that the measure of angle ABC is 70, and the minor arc AC is x, while the major arc ADC is y. Wait, but major arc ADC would be the same as major arc AC, right? Because major arc AC would pass through D. So, if major arc ADC is y, then that is the measure of major arc AC, which is equal to 360° minus minor arc AC (which is x). Therefore:

y = 360° - x

Then, using the formula for the angle formed outside the circle:

m∠ABC = ½ (y - x) = 70°

Substituting y = 360° - x into that equation:

½ ( (360° - x) - x ) = 70°  
½ (360° - 2x) = 70°  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
360° - 2x = 140°  
Then subtract 360° from both sides:  
-2x = 140° - 360°  
-2x = -220°  
Divide both sides by -2:  
x = 110°  

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AC is 110°, which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Is angle ABC indeed formed by two secants outside the circle? That depends on the position of point B. If the problem mentions angle ABC with points A, B, C, and the arcs AC and ADC, then B is likely outside the circle, since the major arc ADC implies that the arc passes through D, meaning that the angle is formed outside. 

Another possibility is that point B is on the circle. But then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC, so its measure would be half of arc AC. In that case, x would be 140°, but then the major arc ADC would be 360 - 140 = 220°, which isn't directly related to the given angle. However, the problem gives us angle ABC as 70°, so if x was 140°, that would mean angle ABC is 70°, which fits. But then why mention the major arc ADC? It seems like the presence of major arc ADC suggests that the angle is formed outside the circle, leading to the difference of arcs. 

But if angle ABC is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, then the formula is ½ (difference of intercepted arcs). Which gives us x=110. 

But which scenario is correct? How do we know where point B is located? The problem statement refers to angle ABC, minor arc AC, and major arc ADC. The notation for the major arc ADC implies that the arc starts at A, goes through D, then ends at C. So, the arc ADC is the major arc AC, which includes point D. Thus, the major arc AC has measure y, which equals 360° - x. 

Assuming that angle ABC is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, then yes, the formula applies. 

So solving ½(y - x) = 70, and since y = 360 - x, substituting:

½((360 - x) - x) = 70  
½(360 - 2x) = 70  
Which simplifies to 360 - 2x = 140  
Then, 2x = 360 - 140 = 220  
Thus, x = 110°. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 110. So that would be the answer. 

Alternatively, if angle ABC were an inscribed angle, then x would be twice the angle, which would be 140°, but that's not among the answer choices unless I misread. Wait, looking back at the answer choices:

A. 90  
B. 100  
C. 110  
D. 120  

So 110 is option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 

I think the key here is understanding where point B lies. Since the problem mentions major arc ADC, which implies that the angle is formed outside the circle, leading to the difference of arcs. Hence, the calculation leads to x=110°, so answer C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the **angle** $ \angle ABC $ and the **arcs** $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ and $ \overset{\frown}{ADC} $. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are told:

- The measure of angle $ \angle ABC = 70^\circ $
- The **minor arc** $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ has measure $ x $
- The **major arc** $ \overset{\frown}{ADC} $ has measure $ y $

From circle geometry, we know:

> If an angle is formed by two **secants intersecting outside** a circle, then the measure of the angle is **half the difference** of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In this case, since $ \angle ABC $ involves points $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and the arc $ \overset{\frown}{ADC} $ is explicitly mentioned as a **major arc**, it suggests that point $ B $ lies **outside** the circle, forming an external angle with respect to the circle.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the External Angle Theorem**

When an angle is formed outside the circle by two secants intersecting at a point outside the circle, the measure of the angle is:

$$
\text{m}\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} (\text{measure of major arc } \overset{\frown}{ADC} - \text{measure of minor arc } \overset{\frown}{AC})
$$

This translates to:

$$
70 = \frac{1}{2}(y - x)
$$

Also, note that:

$$
y = \text{measure of major arc } \overset{\frown}{ADC} = 360^\circ - x
$$

Substitute $ y = 360 - x $ into the earlier equation:

$$
70 = \frac{1}{2}((360 - x) - x)
$$

$$
70 = \frac{1}{2}(360 - 2x)
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
140 = 360 - 2x
$$

Rearranging:

$$
2x = 360 - 140 = 220
$$

$$
x = 110
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Answer**

The measure of the minor arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ is $ x = 110^\circ $, which matches **option C**.

---

### **Final Answer: C**

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
