====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that angle 9 has measure 2x - 4 and angle 10 has measure 2x + 4. We need to find the measure of angle 10. Hmm. Wait, there's also some mention of angles at points A, B, C, but maybe that's part of a triangle? Let me think.

The question mentions Angle(A,B,C), which probably means angle at point B between points A and C. But then it talks about Angle(9) and Angle(10). Maybe these are two angles in a triangle? Or perhaps they are supplementary?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement. There's a line that says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)), MeasureOf(Angle(10)) equals Sub(180, (2x - 4)). Wait, no, that might be confusing. Let me parse the original problem again.

Original problem:

GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(9)
Angle(10)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(10)
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
MeasureOf(Angle(10)
Sub(180, (2*x - 4)

Hmm, maybe the user made a formatting error here. Alternatively, maybe the key information is that the sum of angles 9 and 10 is equal to 180 minus something? Wait, the last line says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)), MeasureOf(Angle(10))) equals Sub(180, (2x - 4))? Or maybe that's part of another equation?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angles in a triangle. For example, if angles 9 and 10 are two angles of a triangle, then their sum would be 180 minus the third angle. However, since the problem gives expressions for both angles in terms of x, maybe we can set up an equation based on their sum plus another angle equals 180 degrees.

But wait, the problem states that m∠9 = 2x - 4 and m∠10 = 2x + 4. So, maybe these two angles are adjacent or form a linear pair? If they are supplementary, their sum would be 180 degrees. Let me check that possibility.

If angles 9 and 10 are supplementary, then:

(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180  
Combine like terms: 4x = 180  
So x = 45. Then, substituting back into angle 10: 2*45 + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94. Which is option B. 

But wait, why would angles 9 and 10 be supplementary? The initial mention of Angle(A,B,C) could imply a triangle. Let me re-examine the problem.

Original problem mentions Angle(A,B,C), which is angle ABC. Then, Angle(9) and Angle(10) are mentioned. Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(9)... Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(10)... So maybe angles 9 and 10 are parts of angle ABC? Like, maybe angle ABC is split into two angles, 9 and 10? But then their measures would add up to angle ABC. But without knowing what angle ABC is, how can we proceed?

Wait, maybe there's more context missing. But given that the problem gives us expressions for angles 9 and 10 in terms of x, and asks for the measure of angle 10, perhaps there's another constraint. Let me look again at the given constraints as written in the problem.

Looking at the lines:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(10)
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
MeasureOf(Angle(10)
Sub(180, (2*x - 4)"

This seems like a possible translation of equations. Maybe the first part says that the measure of angle 9 equals some expression, and measure of angle 10 equals another, and their sum equals 180 minus (2x-4)? That would make sense. Wait, but the way it's written is unclear. Let me try to parse it.

Assuming that the SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)) and MeasureOf(Angle(10)) is equal to Sub(180, (2x - 4)). Wait, but that would mean that angle 9 + angle 10 = 180 - (2x - 4). But angle 9 is given as 2x - 4, angle 10 as 2x + 4. So substituting those into the left side:

(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 4x. And the right side is 180 - (2x - 4) = 180 - 2x + 4 = 184 - 2x.

Therefore, setting them equal:

4x = 184 - 2x  
Adding 2x to both sides: 6x = 184  
Divide by 6: x = 184 / 6 ≈ 30.666...

Then, angle 10 would be 2x + 4 = 2*(184/6) + 4 = (368/6) + 4 ≈ 61.333 + 4 = 65.333... which isn't among the answer choices. So that approach may be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf(angle 9 and angle 10) equals 180 - (something else). Wait, maybe there's another angle involved. For instance, if angles 9 and 10 are two angles in a triangle, then their sum would be 180 - third angle. But without knowing the third angle, this seems difficult.

Wait, going back to the original problem. The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(9)
Angle(10)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(10)
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(9)
MeasureOf(Angle(10)
Sub(180, (2*x - 4)"

It's possible that this is trying to say that angle ABC (Angle(A,B,C)) is being split into two angles, 9 and 10. So angle ABC is equal to angle 9 + angle 10. But angle ABC is also related to the rest of the problem. Wait, but how does the 2x - 4 come into play?

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to a triangle where angle ABC is a certain value, and angles 9 and 10 are other angles. But I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me read the actual question again. It says:

"m ∠9 = 2x - 4, m ∠10 = 2x + 4. Find the measure of ∠10."

Ah! The problem is straightforward once I realize that maybe angles 9 and 10 are supplementary. Because if they are adjacent forming a straight line, their sum is 180 degrees. Let me test that.

So, if angles 9 and 10 are supplementary:

(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180  
Which simplifies to 4x = 180 => x=45. Then m∠10 = 2*45 + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94. Which is option B. But why would angles 9 and 10 be supplementary?

The initial mention of Angle(A,B,C) might indicate that angle ABC is formed by two angles, which are angles 9 and 10. For example, if AB and BC are two sides forming angle ABC, and there's a ray BD splitting angle ABC into angles 9 and 10. In that case, angle ABC would be angle 9 + angle 10. However, if angle ABC is part of a larger figure, maybe a triangle or something else.

But if angle ABC is part of a triangle, then the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Suppose angle ABC is one angle of a triangle, and the other two angles are given as angles 9 and 10? No, because the problem only mentions angles 9 and 10. Wait, unless there's another angle involved.

Alternatively, maybe angles 9 and 10 are remote interior angles relative to some exterior angle? For example, if there's a transversal creating alternate exterior angles or something. But that might complicate things.

Wait, but given the problem provides direct expressions for angles 9 and 10, and asks for the measure of angle 10, and the answer choices, maybe the most straightforward assumption is that angles 9 and 10 are supplementary. Hence leading to x=45 and angle 10 being 94, which is option B.

Alternatively, suppose that angles 9 and 10 are vertical angles or congruent? But that wouldn't help since their measures are different (since one is 2x-4 and the other 2x+4).

Another possibility: maybe angles 9 and 10 are angles in a triangle, so their sum is less than 180. But then without knowing the third angle, we can't set up an equation. Unless there's another relation.

Wait, the problem includes "Sub(180, (2*x - 4)" which might suggest that the sum of angles 9 and 10 equals 180 minus (2x - 4). Let me try that.

So, according to that idea:

measure of angle 9 + measure of angle 10 = 180 - (2x - 4)

We know measure of angle 9 is 2x - 4, measure of angle 10 is 2x + 4. So:

(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180 - (2x - 4)

Left side: 4x

Right side: 180 - 2x + 4 = 184 - 2x

Set equal: 4x = 184 - 2x → 6x = 184 → x = 184 / 6 ≈ 30.666...

Then, measure of angle 10 = 2x + 4 = 2*(184/6) + 4 = 368/6 + 4 = 61.333... + 4 = 65.333..., which isn't an option. So this suggests that this interpretation is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles 9 and 10 equals 180 - (some other term). But without knowing what that term is, this is hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps there was a typo in the problem, and the intended equation is that the sum of angles 9 and 10 equals 180 degrees. Which brings us back to the earlier solution where x=45, angle 10 is 94, which is option B.

Given that this leads to a valid answer in the choices, and the alternative interpretations don't, I think that's the correct path. Therefore, the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 10 $, we begin by analyzing the given relationships:

- $ m\angle 9 = 2x - 4 $
- $ m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 $

---

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Angles

From the structure of the problem, it appears that angles 9 and 10 are **supplementary** — meaning they form a linear pair along a straight line, hence their sum is $ 180^\circ $. This is the most logical interpretation given the absence of specific geometric figures.

Thus, we use the equation:

$$
m\angle 9 + m\angle 10 = 180
$$

Substitute the given expressions:

$$
(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the Equation

$$
2x - 4 + 2x + 4 = 180 \\
4x = 180
$$

Solving for $ x $:

$$
x = 45
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Measure of $ \angle 10 $

Now substitute $ x = 45 $ into the expression for $ m\angle 10 $:

$$
m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 = 2(45) + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
