MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular hexagon named J, K, L, M, N, P inscribed in a circle with center R. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. 

First, I need to recall what a regular hexagon is. A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's inscribed in a circle, that means all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle is point R. 

Now, the central angles mentioned here are angles at the center R between each pair of consecutive vertices. For example, CentralAngleAt(R, J, K) would be the angle formed at R between points J and K. Similarly for the others. 

The key thing here is that in a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, all the central angles are equal. Because the polygon is regular, meaning it's both equiangular and equilateral, so the arcs between each vertex should be equal. Therefore, each central angle corresponds to the same measure. 

So, since there are six sides in a hexagon, the total around the center of the circle should add up to 360 degrees. If all central angles are equal, then each one would be 360 divided by the number of sides. 

Let me write that down. The formula for the measure of a central angle in a regular polygon with n sides is 360/n degrees. Here, n is 6 because it's a hexagon. So plugging in, 360/6 equals 60 degrees. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. Each central angle corresponds to one side of the polygon. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, dividing by the number of sides gives each central angle. Yes, that makes sense. 

But wait, maybe I should check with another approach. For example, in a regular hexagon, each internal angle can be calculated using the formula (n-2)*180/n. Wait, no, that's for internal angles of the polygon itself, not the central angles. 

But the central angles are different. For instance, in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. But that's the angle inside the hexagon at each vertex. However, the central angles are those angles at the center of the circumscribed circle. 

Another way to think about it: each side of the hexagon subtends an arc at the center. Since the whole circle is 360 degrees, each arc corresponding to a side is 360/n. So yes, 360 divided by 6 is 60 degrees. Therefore, each central angle is 60 degrees. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 60. So the answer should be B. 

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Suppose I take a regular hexagon. It's known that in a regular hexagon, the central angles are 60 degrees each. Because when you connect all the vertices to the center, you divide the circle into six equal parts, each being 60 degrees. That makes sense. So each triangle formed by two radii and a side of the hexagon is an equilateral triangle. Hence, all sides are equal, which they are. 

Therefore, the measure of each central angle is indeed 60 degrees. So the correct answer is B.
