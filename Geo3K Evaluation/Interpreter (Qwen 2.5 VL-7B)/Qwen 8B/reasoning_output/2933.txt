MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided.

So, there are several angles mentioned here. The main ones involve points A, B, C, E, F, G. The angles listed are:

- Angle(A,B,C)
- Angle(A,B,E)
- Angle(A,B,F)
- Angle(A,B,G)
- Angle(C,B,E)
- Angle(C,B,F)
- Angle(C,B,G)
- Angle(1) (which is probably ∠1)
  
Additionally, there are some right angle conditions:

- RightAngle(Angle(C,B,E))
- RightAngle(Angle(C,B,F))
- RightAngle(Angle(C,B,G))

And then some IsAngleOf statements:

- IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C)) → So ∠ABC is an angle that's being referred to?
Wait, maybe the notation is different. Wait, perhaps the way it's written is that Angle(X,Y,Z) represents the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So for example, Angle(A,B,C) would be the angle at vertex B formed by points A, B, C. Similarly for others.

Also, the constraints mention:

- IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C)) → Maybe this means that ∠ABC is an angle of something? Not sure yet. Wait, maybe the IsAngleOf is indicating that ∠1 is part of another angle? Or perhaps that ∠1 is equal to ∠ABC?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The user wrote:

IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C)
IsAngleOf(Angle(1)

So, maybe that means that ∠1 is an angle of ∠ABC? Or that ∠1 is part of ∠ABC? Or perhaps that ∠1 is congruent to ∠ABC? Wait, but the exact meaning isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe these AreAngleOf statements indicate that certain angles are related. But since I'm not getting much clarity here, maybe I should focus on the other parts.

But let's see. Also, there's:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,F)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,G)

So, the measure of ∠CBE is equal to something? Wait, no, the Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)... Wait, the original problem might have had some typos or formatting issues. Let me recheck the original problem.

Original problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(A,B,E)
Angle(A,B,F)
Angle(A,B,G)
Angle(C,B,E)
Angle(C,B,F)
Angle(C,B,G)
Angle(1)
RightAngle(Angle(C,B,E)
RightAngle(Angle(C,B,F)
RightAngle(Angle(C,B,G)
IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C)
IsAngleOf(Angle(1)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,F)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,G)

Wait, perhaps the Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E) is missing something? Like Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E), MeasureOf(Angle(...))? Or maybe there was a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the Equals is supposed to compare two measures, like equals to something else. But without more context, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is as follows:

There are multiple angles defined:

- ∠ABC (Angle(A,B,C))
- ∠ABE (Angle(A,B,E))
- ∠ABF (Angle(A,B,F))
- ∠ABG (Angle(A,B,G))
- ∠CBE (Angle(C,B,E))
- ∠CBF (Angle(C,B,F))
- ∠CBG (Angle(C,B,G))
- ∠1 (Angle(1))

Then, the RightAngle constraints say that ∠CBE, ∠CBF, and ∠CBG are right angles. So each of those angles is 90 degrees.

Additionally, there are some IsAngleOf statements. For example, IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) — so ∠ABC is an angle of... something? Maybe that ∠ABC contains ∠1? Or that ∠1 is part of ∠ABC? Or that ∠1 is congruent to ∠ABC? This is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the "IsAngleOf" is meant to indicate that ∠1 is an angle within another angle. For instance, if we have ∠ABC and ∠1 is an angle inside it, then IsAngleOf(Angle(1)) could mean that ∠1 is part of ∠ABC. However, without knowing the exact definition of IsAngleOf, it's hard to tell. But maybe we can proceed with the rest of the info.

Since ∠CBE, ∠CBF, and ∠CBG are right angles (each 90°). So, considering triangle CBE, CBF, CBG — wait, but how do these angles relate to each other?

Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch a diagram mentally. Point B is connected to points C, E, F, G. Since ∠CBE, ∠CBF, ∠CBG are all right angles, that suggests that lines BE, BF, BG are perpendicular to BC. Wait, but if three lines (BE, BF, BG) are all perpendicular to BC, they would all lie along the same line. That can't be possible unless E, F, G are colinear on the line perpendicular to BC at point B. But that seems odd. Unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not all at point B. Wait, the angle notation is Angle(C,B,E) which is the angle at point B between points C and E. So, ∠CBE is the angle at B between C and E. Similarly, ∠CBF is the angle at B between C and F, etc. So, if those angles are all right angles, that implies that each of the segments BE, BF, BG is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC. Which would imply that points E, F, G lie on the line perpendicular to BC at point B. So, they are all on the same line through B, perpendicular to BC. But then, how are points E, F, G arranged? They could be in different directions, but since they're all perpendicular, they'd be collinear.

But then, how does that help us? Let's think about other angles involving point A. There are angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG, and ∠ABC. Also, ∠1 is involved somehow.

Moreover, there's an IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C)), which may mean that ∠1 is an angle within ∠ABC. If that's the case, then ∠1 could be part of ∠ABC, which might split into smaller angles. Also, there's an Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E) — perhaps that the measure of ∠CBE is equal to something? But earlier we said that ∠CBE is a right angle, so its measure is 90°, so maybe that's a typo and it's supposed to be another angle?

Alternatively, maybe the Equals is comparing ∠CBE with another angle. Wait, but the problem statement has:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)" — perhaps missing the second argument. Maybe there was a formatting error, such as Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E), MeasureOf(Angle(...)) ?

Assuming that there's a missing part here, perhaps the intended meaning is that the measure of ∠CBE is equal to the measure of ∠1? Because otherwise, if it's just saying Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E), then that's incomplete. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that ∠CBE is equal to ∠1? Given that ∠CBE is a right angle, then ∠1 would also be 90°, but none of the answer choices include 90°, so that's unlikely. Hence, there's likely a typo or missing part here.

Alternatively, maybe the Equals refers to another angle. Let me check again.

Looking at the problem statement again:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)"
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,F)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,G)

Ah! Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's transcription. Let me read again:

The user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,E)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,F)
IsRightAngle(Angle(C,B,G)"

So, the Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E) is possibly part of a larger expression, but due to formatting, it's cut off. Perhaps the intention was that the measure of ∠CBE is equal to the measure of ∠1? For example, maybe it's supposed to be:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E), MeasureOf(Angle(1)) ?

If that's the case, then since ∠CBE is a right angle (90°), then ∠1 would also be 90°, but again, none of the answer choices are 90°, so that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the Equals is referring to another angle. For example, if there's a typo and the angle is ∠ABC instead of ∠CBE?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the measure of ∠CBE is equal to the measure of ∠ABC? But since ∠CBE is 90°, that would make ∠ABC = 90°, which again may not fit with answer choices.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the notation. Let me consider that maybe the problem involves triangle ABC with some additional points E, F, G forming right angles at B. Then, angles involving A and B and those points.

Another approach: Let's assume that the key is that ∠CBE, ∠CBF, and ∠CBG are all right angles, implying that lines BE, BF, BG are perpendicular to BC. Thus, they are all lying on the same line perpendicular to BC at B. Therefore, points E, F, G are colinear along that perpendicular line.

Now, looking at angles involving point A: ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG, and ∠ABC. So, depending on where E, F, G are located along the perpendicular line, these angles vary.

Suppose we imagine point A somewhere in the plane, connected to B, and then lines BE, BF, BG going up from B perpendicularly. The angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would depend on the position of A relative to the line BE, BF, BG.

But since there are three different points E, F, G on the same line, perhaps they divide the perpendicular line into segments, creating different angles from A to B to each of them.

But how does this relate to ∠1?

Additionally, there's the IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) and IsAngleOf(Angle(1). If ∠1 is an angle within ∠ABC, then maybe ∠1 is part of ∠ABC. Suppose ∠ABC is divided into several angles, including ∠1 and others. 

But without more specific information, this is challenging. Let's try to look for relationships using the given data.

We know that ∠CBE, ∠CBF, and ∠CBG are all right angles. So, for example, ∠CBE = 90°, which is the angle between BC and BE. Similarly for the others.

Let me consider triangles involving point A. For example, triangle ABE, ABF, ABG. Each of these triangles has a right angle at B because BE, BF, BG are perpendicular to BC.

Wait, if BE is perpendicular to BC, then triangle ABE has a right angle at B. Similarly for ABF and ABG. Therefore, in each of these triangles, the angle at B is 90°, making them right triangles.

In such cases, the angles at A would be complementary to the angles at E, F, G. For example, in triangle ABE, the sum of angles is 180°, so ∠BAE + ∠ABE + ∠AEB = 180°. Since ∠ABE is 90°, then ∠BAE + ∠AEB = 90°. Therefore, ∠BAE = 90° - ∠AEB.

Similarly for the other triangles. However, without knowing specific lengths or other angles, it's difficult to find numerical values.

But the question asks for the measure of ∠1. Assuming that ∠1 is one of the angles mentioned, like ∠ABE, or perhaps ∠1 is ∠ABC?

Wait, the problem mentions IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) and IsAngleOf(Angle(1). So maybe ∠1 is an angle that is part of ∠ABC. For example, if ∠ABC is split into ∠1 and another angle. Or maybe ∠1 is equal to ∠ABC?

Alternatively, maybe ∠1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of lines from A to E, F, G. But without a diagram, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the key lies in the fact that there are three right angles at B (from ∠CBE, ∠CBF, ∠CBG). Since they are all right angles, the lines BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC. So, they are colinear. Therefore, points E, F, G are aligned in a straight line perpendicular to BC at B.

Now, if we consider point A connected to B, and then lines AE, AF, AG. Depending on where A is, the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would vary. But since E, F, G are on the same line, these angles would form a sequence of angles from A to B to each of E, F, G.

For example, suppose E is closer to B than F, and F closer than G. Then, the angles ∠ABE < ∠ABF < ∠ABG, assuming A is positioned such that each subsequent point is further along the perpendicular line.

But how does this relate to the measure of ∠1? If ∠1 is one of these angles, like ∠ABE, then we need to determine its measure based on other constraints.

However, there's another piece of information: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E). Assuming that this is supposed to compare ∠CBE with ∠1, but since ∠CBE is 90°, then ∠1 would be 90°, which is not among the answer choices. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the Equals refers to another angle. For example, if it's supposed to be Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E), MeasureOf(Angle(1)), then ∠CBE = ∠1 => 90° = ∠1, still not matching answer choices.

Alternatively, maybe the Equals is comparing ∠CBE with another angle, like ∠ABC. If ∠ABC = ∠CBE = 90°, then ∠ABC is 90°, and if ∠1 is part of ∠ABC, then ∠1 could be some portion of it.

But if ∠ABC is 90°, and ∠1 is part of it, then ∠1 could be, for example, half of it, making it 45°, which is option B. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where ∠1 is an external angle or something else.

Wait, another thought: If BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC, then lines BE, BF, BG are all parallel to each other (since they're all perpendicular to BC). Therefore, they are parallel lines. Now, if point A is connected to E, F, G, then lines AE, AF, AG create various angles with AB.

But how does that help? Let's consider the angles at point A. For example, if we look at triangle ABE, which is a right triangle at B. In such a triangle, the angles at A and E add up to 90°. If we denote ∠BAE as x, then ∠AEB would be 90° - x.

Similarly, for triangle ABF, which is also a right triangle at B, the angle at A (∠BAF) would be y, and ∠AFB would be 90° - y.

Same for triangle ABG: ∠BAG = z, ∠AGB = 90° - z.

But how does this connect to ∠1? If ∠1 is one of these angles, like ∠BAE, ∠BAF, or ∠BAG, then we need more relations.

But there's also the angle ∠ABC. ∠ABC is the angle at B between BA and BC. Since BE, BF, BG are perpendicular to BC, then ∠ABC is the angle between BA and BC. If we consider that ∠ABE is part of ∠ABC, since E is on the perpendicular line. Wait, no. Because BE is perpendicular to BC, so the direction of BE is perpendicular to BC. So, the angle between BA and BE would be ∠ABE, which is part of ∠ABC if BA is on one side of BC.

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to assign variables and write equations.

Let me define ∠ABC as θ. Since BE is perpendicular to BC, the angle between BE and BC is 90°, so the angle between BA and BE would be ∠ABE. If we imagine BA making some angle with BC, then ∠ABE would be θ minus the angle between BA and BE. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Imagine point B with BC going horizontally to the right, and BE going vertically upward (since it's perpendicular to BC). Now, BA is some line from B to A. The angle between BA and BC is ∠ABC = θ. The angle between BA and BE would be ∠ABE, which depends on the orientation of BA.

But since BE is vertical, and BC is horizontal, then ∠ABE is the angle between BA and the vertical line BE. If BA makes an angle θ with BC (horizontal), then ∠ABE would be 90° - θ, because θ + ∠ABE = 90°.

Wait, yes! If BC is horizontal, BE is vertical, then the angle between BA and BC is θ, and the angle between BA and BE would be 90° - θ. So ∠ABE = 90° - θ.

Similarly, if we consider other points F and G on the same vertical line BE, then their positions would affect the angles ∠ABF and ∠ABG. But if they are on the same line, then moving from E to F to G along BE, the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would decrease or increase depending on the direction. Wait, if F is further along the vertical line from B than E, then ∠ABF would be smaller than ∠ABE, assuming A is above or below.

This is getting complicated. Let's assume that ∠1 is ∠ABE, which would be 90° - θ, where θ is ∠ABC. But if there's another relation involving θ, we can find it.

But what else do we know? There's the IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) and IsAngleOf(Angle(1). If ∠1 is an angle within ∠ABC, then maybe ∠1 is part of ∠ABC, so ∠ABC = ∠1 + other angles. But without knowing the exact relationship, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe ∠1 is ∠ABC itself? But then we need to find its measure.

Wait, let's go back to the earlier idea where ∠ABE = 90° - θ, where θ is ∠ABC. And if there are other angles involving A, like ∠ABF and ∠ABG, which might relate to other right angles.

Wait, but if there are three right angles at B (for CBE, CBF, CBG), then the line BE, BF, BG are all the same line (perpendicular to BC), so points E, F, G are colinear. So, if you move from E to F to G along this perpendicular line, then the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would change accordingly.

Assume that A is positioned such that when you draw lines from A to E, F, G, you get different angles. However, without specific information about the positions of E, F, G, it's hard to determine.

But there's another clue: the problem mentions that IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) and IsAngleOf(Angle(1). This might suggest that ∠1 is part of ∠ABC. If ∠1 is part of ∠ABC, and if ∠ABC is made up of other angles, like ∠ABE and others.

Wait, if ∠1 is ∠ABE, and ∠ABE = 90° - θ, where θ is ∠ABC, then ∠1 = 90° - θ. But if we can express θ in terms of other known quantities, we can find ∠1.

But how?

Alternatively, if we consider that there are three right angles at B, and lines from A to E, F, G, which are along the same perpendicular line. Then, the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would be decreasing or increasing as we move from E to F to G.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Let's think of special cases. For example, if A is placed such that ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG are complementary angles. Or perhaps forming a series of angles adding up to something.

Wait, but there's also the possibility that the problem involves a triangle with multiple right angles, leading to specific angle measures. For instance, if we consider triangle ABC, with BE, BF, BG as altitudes or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that ∠CBE, ∠CBF, ∠CBG are all right angles, and hence, lines BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC. So, if we consider point A connected to B, then the lines AE, AF, AG form various angles with BE, BF, BG.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The answer choices are 37, 45, 53, 63. These numbers are commonly associated with standard angles in geometry problems, especially with 3-4-5 triangles or 5-12-13 triangles, which have angles around 37°, 53°, etc., or 45° for isosceles right triangles.

Given that, and the presence of right angles, maybe the problem involves a 3-4-5 triangle or similar. For example, if ∠1 is one of the acute angles in such a triangle, it could be 37° or 53°, or 45°.

But how to connect this to the given constraints?

Wait, let's revisit the initial assumptions. If ∠CBE, ∠CBF, ∠CBG are all right angles, then lines BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC. So, if we imagine BC as a horizontal line, and BE, BF, BG as vertical lines upwards from B. Now, if point A is somewhere such that lines AE, AF, AG are drawn, forming various angles with AB.

Now, if we consider triangle ABE, which is a right triangle at B, with legs AB and BE, and hypotenuse AE. Similarly for triangles ABF and ABG.

If we assume that A is positioned such that AB is at a certain angle, creating specific angles. Let's say ∠ABE is one of the angles we're trying to find, which is ∠1.

If ∠ABE = 37°, then in the right triangle ABE, the other non-right angle would be 53°, which is common in 3-4-5 triangles. Similarly, if ∠ABE is 53°, then the other angle is 37°. Or if it's 45°, then it's an isosceles right triangle.

But how do we determine which one it is?

Perhaps there's a relationship between the angles created by the multiple right angles. For example, if lines BE, BF, BG are spaced equally along the perpendicular, creating equal angles from AB, but that's speculation.

Alternatively, since there are three right angles at B, maybe the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG are related. For instance, if the points E, F, G are placed such that the angles between BE, BF, BG are divided into equal parts. But without knowing the exact placement, it's hard to say.

Wait, but if we consider that BE, BF, BG are all on the same line, then the angles ∠ABE, ∠ABF, ∠ABG would be measured from BA to each of these points. If E, F, G are equally spaced along the perpendicular, then the angles between BA and BE, BA and BF, BA and BG would differ by equal amounts. But again, without specifics, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that ∠ABC is composed of multiple angles. For example, if ∠ABC is divided into ∠ABE, ∠EBF, and ∠FBC, but since ∠CBE is 90°, which is ∠EBF + ... No, this is getting too vague.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that ∠1 is ∠ABC. If we can find ∠ABC, that would give us the answer. To find ∠ABC, we might need to use the fact that ∠CBE is a right angle. Let me think about triangle ABC.

If we extend BC to a point E such that BE is perpendicular to BC, then in triangle ABE, we have a right angle at B. So, ∠ABE + ∠BAE = 90°. But ∠ABE is part of ∠ABC. Wait, if BE is perpendicular to BC, then ∠ABE is the angle between BA and BE, which is not directly part of ∠ABC unless A is positioned in a specific way.

Alternatively, if we consider that ∠ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Since BE is perpendicular to BC, then the angle between BA and BE is ∠ABE = ∠ABC + 90° or something like that. Wait, no. Let me visualize this: If BC is horizontal, BE is vertical upwards. BA is some line from B. The angle between BA and BC is ∠ABC. The angle between BA and BE is ∠ABE. These two angles would add up to 90°, because BE is perpendicular to BC. So ∠ABC + ∠ABE = 90°. Therefore, ∠ABE = 90° - ∠ABC.

If that's the case, and if ∠1 is ∠ABE, then ∠1 = 90° - ∠ABC. But we need to find ∠1, so we need to find ∠ABC.

How can we find ∠ABC? Well, if there are other angles involving point A and other points.

Wait, there's also the angle ∠ABF, which is similar to ∠ABE, but involving point F. Since BF is also perpendicular to BC, similar logic applies: ∠ABF = 90° - ∠ABC. But this would imply that ∠ABE = ∠ABF, which would only be true if E and F are the same point, which they aren't. Hence, this suggests a flaw in the previous reasoning.

Wait, no. If both BE and BF are perpendicular to BC, then they are the same line. So, points E and F are on the same line, so ∠ABE and ∠ABF are measurements from BA to different points on the same line. Hence, ∠ABE and ∠ABF would be different angles, depending on where E and F are located.

But how? If E is closer to B than F, then ∠ABE would be smaller than ∠ABF, assuming A is positioned such that extending BE past E reaches F. Or vice versa.

But without knowing the exact positions of E, F, G, it's impossible to determine the exact measure.

However, there's another constraint: the IsAngleOf(Angle(A,B,C) and IsAngleOf(Angle(1). If ∠1 is part of ∠ABC, then perhaps ∠1 is the complement of ∠ABC. For example, if ∠1 = 90° - ∠ABC, and if there's another equation relating ∠1 to other angles.

But without additional information, it's still unclear.

Wait, let's think about the fact that there are three right angles at B. If we consider that lines BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular to BC, then they are all on the same line. So, if we imagine A somewhere in the plane, and lines from A to E, F, G, then those lines would create various angles with AB.

But if we consider that ∠1 is one of these angles, like ∠ABE, and there's a relationship between ∠1 and the right angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the exterior angles or something else.

Another idea: Since there are three right angles at B, maybe the lines AE, AF, AG form specific angles with AB, leading to certain properties. For example, if ∠ABE is x, then ∠ABF is x + y, and ∠ABG is x + 2y, or something similar.

But again, without knowing how many divisions there are, it's hard to say.

Wait, but the answer choices include 45°, which is a common angle. If ∠1 is 45°, then it's possible that ∠ABC is 45°, making ∠ABE = 45°, but this would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, if ∠1 is part of a 45-45-90 triangle.

But I need to find a way to link the given constraints to the measure of ∠1.

Let me try to consider the possibility that ∠1 is 45°, which is option B. Why? Because it's a common angle in right triangles, and the presence of multiple right angles might suggest symmetry.

Alternatively, if we consider that the three right angles at B mean that lines BE, BF, BG are all perpendicular, and if A is placed such that AB forms a 45° angle with BC, then ∠ABE would be 45°, making ∠1 = 45°.

But why would that be the case? If AB is at 45° to BC, then ∠ABC is 45°, and since BE is perpendicular to BC, the angle between AB and BE would be 45°, making ∠ABE = 45°, which would be ∠1.

This fits with option B. But is there any reason to believe that ∠ABC is 45°?

Well, if there are three right angles at B, maybe the configuration is symmetric, leading to ∠ABC being 45°. Alternatively, maybe it's derived from some other geometric property.

Alternatively, if we consider that the sum of certain angles equals 180°, or other relations.

But without concrete steps, it's hard to justify. However, given that 45° is a common angle and appears in answer choices, and the presence of right angles, this might be the intended answer.

Thus, after this lengthy reasoning, I'll go with option B, 45°.
