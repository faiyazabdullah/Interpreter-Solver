MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle EGF, right? And there are several points and lines mentioned. The key thing here is that it's a right triangle because they mention Right(Triangle(E,G,F)). Also, the angle at G, which is Angle(E,G,F), is a right angle. Wait, noâ€”the notation for angles can sometimes be confusing. Let me parse that again.

The problem states: RightAngle(Angle(E,G,F)), so that means the angle at point G between points E and F is a right angle. Therefore, triangle EGF is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at G. That makes sense because then the sides EG and GF would be the legs, and EF would be the hypotenuse.

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle 1. But wait, there's also mentions of MeasureOf(Angle(1) and Subtract(90, 25). Hmm, maybe angle 1 refers to another angle in the triangle? Let me check the rest of the constraints.

They have Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1), Subtract(90, 25)). Oh! So they're saying that the measure of angle 1 is equal to 90 minus 25. Wait, but why? Maybe angle 1 is one of the acute angles in the right triangle?

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Subtract(90, 25)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)"

Wait, perhaps there's a typo or formatting issue here. Let me read that part again:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Subtract(90, 25)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)"

So maybe it's structured as:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = Subtract(90, 25)

and 

MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = ?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that angle 1 is subtracted from 90 to get angle 2? Or perhaps angle 1 is 90 minus 25, and angle 2 is something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's more context. Let me look back.

The problem gives us that the triangle is right-angled at G (since RightAngle(Angle(E,G,F)), meaning the right angle is at G. Then, the triangle has three angles: at E, G, and F. Since it's a right triangle, the sum of the other two angles must be 90 degrees.

But the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2. Maybe angle 1 is one of the acute angles, and angle 2 is another? However, the way the problem is written might be that Subtract(90,25) equals MeasureOf(Angle(1))? Wait, the user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Subtract(90, 25)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)"

This seems like a syntax error, but perhaps it's supposed to mean:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = Subtract(90, 25)

and

MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = ... ?

Alternatively, maybe there was a misformatting, and the actual equations are:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = Subtract(90, 25)

and 

MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = ?

But without more info, maybe we need to infer based on standard triangle problems.

Since it's a right triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90 degrees. Suppose angle 1 and angle 2 are those two angles. If one of them is 25 degrees, then the other would be 65 degrees. Wait, but how does Subtract(90,25) come into play?

If Subtract(90,25) is 65, then maybe angle 1 is 65 degrees, and angle 2 is 25 degrees? But the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1), Subtract(90, 25)), so angle 1 would be 90 - 25 = 65 degrees. Then angle 2 would be 25 degrees. So the measure of angle 1 is 65 degrees, which would correspond to option C.

Let me verify. In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary. So if one angle is 25 degrees, the other is 65 degrees. If angle 1 is 90 - 25, then angle 1 is 65 degrees. Hence, answer C.

Looking at the answer choices: A.25, B.55, C.65, D.75. So 65 is option C. Thus, the correct answer should be C.
