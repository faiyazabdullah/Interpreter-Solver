MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D connected as lines AB, BC, CD, DA. The angles mentioned are angle ABD (which I think is angle at B between A and D?), angle BCD (at point C between B and D), angle CDA (at point D between C and A), and angle DAB (at point A between D and B). Wait, actually, the problem states:

Given that measure of angle ABD equals measure of angle CDA, which equals measure of angle BCD. And then they ask for m∠ABC when m∠CDA is 61 degrees. Let me parse this again carefully.

Wait, the original question says:

Angle(A,B,D) – so vertex at B? Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(A,B,D) would be ∠ABD, right? Similarly, Angle(B,C,D) is ∠BCD. Angle(C,D,A) is ∠CDA. And Angle(D,A,B) is ∠DAB. Then the equalities are MeasureOf(Angle ABD) = MeasureOf(Angle CDA) = MeasureOf(Angle BCD). So those three angles are equal. Given that m∠CDA is 61°, find m∠ABC.

So first, let's note down all the given information:

- Quadrilateral ABCD with sides AB, BC, CD, DA.
- Angles:
  - ∠ABD = ∠CDA = ∠BCD = 61°
- Need to find measure of ∠ABC.

Let me try to visualize the quadrilateral. Maybe draw it out mentally. Points A, B, C, D connected in order. Let me consider the angles mentioned.

First, ∠CDA is at point D, between points C, D, A. So that's angle ADC. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as Angle(C,D,A), which would be ∠CDA. So yes, ∠ADC? Wait no. If you write Angle(C,D,A), the vertex is D, so it's angle at D between C and A. Therefore, ∠ADC. So ∠ADC = 61°, same as ∠ABD and ∠BCD.

Now, need to relate these angles to find ∠ABC.

Hmm. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, maybe we can use properties of quadrilaterals. But since there are specific angles given, perhaps we need to look into triangles formed within the quadrilateral?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD, triangle BCD, etc. Let me think.

First, let's recall that in a quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees. However, here we might not know all angles yet.

But given some angles, perhaps we can find relations. Let me list all angles:

The four angles of quadrilateral ABCD are:

1. At A: ∠DAB
2. At B: ∠ABC
3. At C: ∠BCD
4. At D: ∠CDA

But according to the problem, ∠ABD (which is part of angle at B) and ∠BCD (angle at C) and ∠CDA (angle at D) are all equal to 61 degrees. Wait, but ∠ABD is not the entire angle at B; it's just a part of it. Similarly, ∠BCD is the entire angle at C. Wait, hold on:

Wait, ∠ABD is an angle inside the quadrilateral. Let me clarify:

- ∠ABD is the angle at point B between points A and D. So that's part of the angle at B (∠ABC). Because the full angle at B is between points A, B, C. So ∠ABD is part of that. Wait, unless BD is a diagonal. Oh, right! The problem mentions Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. But there's also diagonals? For example, BD connects B to D, which isn't a side. So the diagonal BD splits the quadrilateral into two triangles: ABD and BCD.

Therefore, ∠ABD is an angle in triangle ABD, and ∠BCD is an angle in triangle BCD. Also, ∠CDA is angle at D, which is part of triangle ADC.

Wait, but given that ∠ABD = ∠BCD = ∠CDA = 61°, maybe we can use triangle properties.

Let me start by analyzing triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, we know one angle: ∠ABD = 61°. What else do we know about triangle ABD? Well, the other angles would be ∠BAD and ∠ADB. But ∠BAD is part of the angle at A (∠DAB) of the quadrilateral. Similarly, ∠ADB is another angle in triangle ABD.

Similarly, looking at triangle BCD: ∠BCD = 61°, and the other angles would be ∠CBD and ∠CDB. But ∠CBD is part of angle at B (∠ABC), and ∠CDB is part of angle at D (∠CDA).

Wait, but ∠CDA is given as 61°, which is the angle at D between C and A. That's ∠ADC. Which is adjacent to ∠CDB in triangle BCD? Wait, if we consider triangle BCD, then ∠CDB is part of angle at D. Wait, but ∠ADC is the entire angle at D. So ∠ADC is composed of ∠ADB + ∠CDB? Or wait, depends on how the diagonal BD divides the quadrilateral.

Wait, if BD is a diagonal connecting B to D, then at point D, angle ADC is split into two angles: ∠ADB and ∠CDB? No, because angle ADC is at point D between points C and A. If BD is drawn, then at point D, angle ADC is between DC and DA. The diagonal BD would create angle between DC and DB (which is ∠CDB) and between DB and DA (which is ∠ADB). Wait, but ∠ADC is made up of ∠ADB and ∠CDB? Wait, no. If you have point D connected to B, then angle ADC is between DC and DA. The line DB splits that angle into two parts: from DC to DB (which is ∠CDB) and from DB to DA (which is ∠ADB). Therefore, ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠CDB. But according to the problem, ∠ADC = 61°, so ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 61°.

But in triangle BCD, we have angles ∠BCD = 61°, ∠CDB, and ∠CBD. So sum of angles in triangle BCD is 180°, so:

∠BCD + ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 180°
=> 61° + ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 180°
=> ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 119°.

But also, from earlier, ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 61°, so ∠ADB = 61° - ∠CDB.

Now, looking at triangle ABD, which has angles ∠ABD = 61°, ∠BAD, and ∠ADB. Sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠ABD + ∠BAD + ∠ADB = 180°
=> 61° + ∠BAD + (61° - ∠CDB) ) = 180°
Because ∠ADB = 61° - ∠CDB.

So substituting:

61 + ∠BAD + 61 - ∠CDB = 180
Combine terms:

(61 + 61) + ∠BAD - ∠CDB = 180
122 + ∠BAD - ∠CDB = 180
Thus,

∠BAD - ∠CDB = 180 - 122 = 58°
So ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°

But I don't know what ∠CDB is yet. Let me see if I can find more relationships.

Also, looking back at triangle BCD, we had ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 119°, so ∠CBD = 119° - ∠CDB.

But ∠CBD is part of the angle at B (∠ABC). Because angle at B is between points A, B, C. So ∠ABC is composed of ∠ABD (given as 61°) and ∠CBD. Wait, is that correct?

Yes! Because if we draw diagonal BD, then at point B, the angle ∠ABC is split into ∠ABD and ∠CBD. Therefore:

∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61° + ∠CBD

From earlier, ∠CBD = 119° - ∠CDB. Therefore:

∠ABC = 61° + (119° - ∠CDB) = 180° - ∠CDB

So ∠ABC = 180° - ∠CDB.

But from earlier, we had ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°, so ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°.

But ∠BAD is part of the angle at A of the quadrilateral, which is ∠DAB. So in the quadrilateral, the total internal angles sum to 360°, so:

Sum of angles at A, B, C, D = 360°

We have:

At D: ∠ADC = 61°
At C: ∠BCD = 61°
At B: ∠ABC = 180° - ∠CDB
At A: ∠DAB = ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°

So adding them all together:

∠DAB + ∠ABC + ∠BCD + ∠ADC = 360°

Substituting:

(∠CDB + 58°) + (180° - ∠CDB) + 61° + 61° = 360°

Let me compute each term:

First term: ∠CDB + 58°
Second term: 180° - ∠CDB
Third term: 61°
Fourth term: 61°

Adding them together:

(∠CDB + 58°) + (180° - ∠CDB) + 61° + 61° 

The ∠CDB terms cancel out:

∠CDB cancels with -∠CDB, leaving:

58° + 180° + 61° + 61° = ?

Compute:

58 + 180 = 238

Then 238 + 61 = 299, then 299 + 61 = 360°

Which matches the total sum of angles in a quadrilateral. So that checks out, but it doesn't help us find ∠CDB directly. Hmm. So we need another equation.

Wait, but perhaps we can find something else. Let me check if there's another relation.

Looking at triangle ABD, we had ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°, and ∠BAD is part of the quadrilateral's angle at A. Is there anything else about angle at A?

Alternatively, maybe we can consider triangle ADC. Wait, angle at D is ∠ADC = 61°, which is already considered. Also, in triangle ADC, we could find angles, but without knowing more info.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD and triangle BCD?

Wait, but we have too many variables here. Let me think again.

We have:

∠ABC = 180° - ∠CDB

And from above, ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°

But also, in the quadrilateral, the sum of angles is 360°, which we used already. But that didn't give us new info.

Is there another way to relate these variables?

Wait, maybe using triangle ABD and triangle CBD?

In triangle ABD, we have angles:

∠ABD = 61°, ∠BAD = x, ∠ADB = y, such that x + y + 61 = 180 → x + y = 119°

Earlier, we said that ∠ADB = 61° - ∠CDB, because ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 61°, so y = 61° - ∠CDB.

So substituting into x + y = 119:

x + (61° - ∠CDB) = 119 → x = 119 - 61 + ∠CDB = 58 + ∠CDB → which matches our previous conclusion that ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°, since ∠BAD = x.

So that gives us ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°, but how does that help?

Maybe we can look at triangle ADC. Let me think.

Triangle ADC has angles at A, D, and C. Wait, ∠ADC is 61°, as given. What about the other angles?

Wait, angle at A is ∠DAC, which is part of ∠BAD. Because ∠BAD is the angle at A between BA and DA. So if we consider triangle ADC, the angle at A is ∠DAC, which is part of ∠BAD. Wait, but unless there's a diagonal AC, which we haven't considered yet.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider other triangles. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the quadrilateral is cyclic? Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the quadrilateral is cyclic. So we can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles?

For instance, in triangle ABD and triangle CBD, maybe there are similar triangles?

Wait, let's suppose that triangles ABD and CBD have some relationship. But I don't know if they are similar or congruent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between ∠CDB and ∠BAD?

Wait, earlier we had ∠BAD = ∠CDB + 58°, and ∠ABC = 180° - ∠CDB.

If I denote ∠CDB as z, then:

∠BAD = z + 58°

and ∠ABC = 180° - z

So, if I can express another equation involving z, I can solve for it.

But how?

Let me think about the angles in the quadrilateral again. We have:

At A: ∠DAB = z + 58°

At B: ∠ABC = 180° - z

At C: ∠BCD = 61°

At D: ∠ADC = 61°

Total sum: (z + 58) + (180 - z) + 61 + 61 = 360. As before, which simplifies to 360=360. So no new info.

Hmm. So we need another equation. Perhaps considering triangle ABD and triangle CBD?

Wait, maybe looking at triangle ABD and triangle CDB? Are they similar?

In triangle ABD: angles are 61°, ∠BAD = z + 58°, and ∠ADB = 61° - z.

In triangle CBD: angles are ∠BCD = 61°, ∠CBD = 119° - z, and ∠CDB = z.

So comparing angles:

In triangle ABD: angles are 61°, z+58°, 61-z.

In triangle CBD: angles are 61°, 119-z, z.

Are these triangles similar? Not sure unless certain conditions are met.

But maybe there's a relationship between their sides? Without knowing side lengths, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe there's another angle relationship.

Wait, let me think about the entire quadrilateral. Suppose we consider the sum of angles at A and C?

At A: ∠DAB = z + 58°

At C: ∠BCD = 61°

But I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of ∠ABC and ∠ADC is related? Not sure.

Wait, another idea: since ∠ABD = 61°, which is part of ∠ABC, and ∠ABC = 180° - z, then:

∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61° + ∠CBD = 180° - z → so ∠CBD = 180° - z - 61° = 119° - z. Which we already knew from triangle BCD.

But how does that help?

Wait, but maybe there's another triangle where we can apply the Law of Sines.

In triangle ABD:

sin(∠ABD)/AD = sin(∠ADB)/AB

Similarly, in triangle CBD:

sin(∠BCD)/BD = sin(∠CDB)/BC

But without knowing side lengths, this seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe assuming that the quadrilateral is convex, and trying to find relations between angles?

Alternatively, maybe using exterior angles?

Wait, another approach: since ∠ABD = ∠CDA = ∠BCD = 61°, maybe there's some symmetry or special type of quadrilateral.

Wait, but without more information, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe considering that ∠ABD = ∠CDA. Let me think about triangle ABD and triangle DAC?

Not sure. Alternatively, maybe considering that ∠ABD = ∠CDA implies some proportionality?

Alternatively, think about the fact that ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°, which may imply that triangles ABD and DCA are similar?

Wait, for similarity, we'd need corresponding angles to be equal. Let me check:

In triangle ABD: angles are 61°, ∠BAD, ∠ADB.

In triangle DCA: angles at D is 61°, at C is... Wait, triangle DCA would have angles at D, C, A. ∠DCA is part of ∠BCD? Wait, ∠BCD is 61°, which is at point C. So ∠DCB is 61°, and ∠DCA would be part of that if there was a diagonal AC. But I don't think we have that.

This seems too vague. Let me go back.

We have two expressions involving z:

∠BAD = z + 58°, and ∠ABC = 180° - z.

But we also know that in the quadrilateral, the sum of all angles is 360°, which gave us nothing new. So maybe there's another relationship from triangle ABD or triangle BCD?

Wait, in triangle ABD, we have angles:

∠ABD = 61°, ∠BAD = z + 58°, ∠ADB = 61° - z.

These must satisfy that the sum is 180°, which they do:

61 + (z + 58) + (61 - z) = 61 + z + 58 + 61 - z = 61 + 58 + 61 = 180. Correct.

Same for triangle BCD:

∠BCD = 61°, ∠CDB = z, ∠CBD = 119° - z.

Sum: 61 + z + (119 - z) = 180. Correct.

So both triangles are consistent.

But still, how to find z?

Perhaps there's another angle relationship. Let me think about the remaining angles in the quadrilateral.

At point A: ∠DAB = z + 58°

At point B: ∠ABC = 180° - z

At point C: ∠BCD = 61°

At point D: ∠ADC = 61°

Total sum: (z + 58) + (180 - z) + 61 + 61 = 360, which works.

But if I can find another equation involving z, I can solve it.

Wait, maybe considering triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have angles:

At D: ∠ADC = 61°

At A: ∠DAC = ?

At C: ∠ACD = ?

Wait, but unless we have more info about triangle ADC, it's hard to proceed. Unless there's a way to express ∠DAC and ∠ACD in terms of other angles.

Wait, ∠DAC is part of ∠DAB, which is z + 58°. If I can find ∠DAC, then...

But how?

Alternatively, think about the diagonal AC. If we draw diagonal AC, it splits the quadrilateral into triangles ABC and ADC.

In triangle ADC, angles are ∠DAC, ∠ACD, and ∠ADC = 61°. Their sum is 180°, so ∠DAC + ∠ACD + 61 = 180 → ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 119°.

But how to relate these angles to others?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABC. It has angles at A, B, and C.

Wait, ∠ABC is 180° - z, as established.

At point A, in triangle ABC, the angle is ∠BAC, which is different from ∠DAB. Wait, ∠DAB is the angle at A between DA and BA, while ∠BAC is the angle at A between BA and CA. So unless we know something about diagonal AC, it's unclear.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, going back to the beginning. The problem says that ∠ABD = ∠BCD = ∠CDA = 61°. Let me re-express these angles:

- ∠ABD is at point B, between A and D.
- ∠BCD is at point C, between B and D.
- ∠CDA is at point D, between C and A.

Now, perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral property? If a quadrilateral has opposite angles supplementary, but that applies only to cyclic quadrilaterals. But we don't know if it's cyclic.

However, if the quadrilateral were cyclic, then ∠ABD and ∠CDA would be subtended by the same arc, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe considering that ∠ABD = ∠CDA suggests that arcs or something... Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that in triangle ABD and triangle CDA, there's some relationship.

Wait, in triangle ABD: ∠ABD = 61°, and in triangle CDA: ∠CDA = 61°. If these triangles are similar, then their corresponding angles would be equal. Let me check.

For similarity, we need corresponding angles to be equal. Let me suppose that triangle ABD ~ triangle CDA.

That would require:

∠ABD corresponds to ∠CDA (both 61°), and other angles correspond.

So, if ∠ABD corresponds to ∠CDA, then ∠BAD would correspond to ∠DCA, and ∠ADB would correspond to ∠CAD.

If that's the case, then:

∠BAD = ∠DCA

and ∠ADB = ∠CAD

Let me explore this possibility.

Assuming triangle ABD ~ triangle CDA (in that order), then:

∠ABD = ∠CDA (given, both 61°)

∠BAD = ∠DCA

∠ADB = ∠CAD

So, from ∠BAD = ∠DCA, and ∠ADB = ∠CAD.

Let me denote:

Let’s call ∠BAD = α, and ∠DCA = α.

Also, ∠ADB = β, and ∠CAD = β.

Now, in triangle ABD:

∠ABD = 61°, ∠BAD = α, ∠ADB = β. So 61 + α + β = 180 => α + β = 119°

In triangle CDA:

∠CDA = 61°, ∠DCA = α, ∠CAD = β. So 61 + α + β = 180 => same as above, α + β = 119°. Consistent.

Now, looking at the rest of the quadrilateral.

At point A: ∠DAB = α (from above), which is the angle between DA and BA.

At point D: ∠ADC = 61°, which is between DC and DA.

At point C: ∠DCA = α (as per assumption), which is part of ∠BCD = 61°. Wait, ∠BCD is the angle at point C between B and D. So ∠BCD includes ∠DCA (α) and another angle?

Wait, if we consider point C, the angle ∠BCD is between points B, C, D. This angle can be split into ∠BCA and ∠DCA if we draw diagonal AC. Wait, but we don't know about AC.

Wait, if we consider diagonal AC, then at point C, ∠BCD is composed of ∠BCA and ∠DCA. So:

∠BCD = ∠BCA + ∠DCA = 61°

But from our assumption, ∠DCA = α, so ∠BCA = 61° - α.

Similarly, in triangle ABC, we have angles at A, B, and C.

At point A: ∠BAC = β (since ∠CAD = β, and ∠BAC is the same as ∠BAD - ∠CAD? Wait, no. Wait, ∠BAC is part of ∠BAD. Wait, ∠BAD is the angle at A between BA and DA. If we draw diagonal AC, then ∠BAC is the angle between BA and CA, and ∠CAD is the angle between CA and DA. Thus, ∠BAD = ∠BAC + ∠CAD = ∠BAC + β. But earlier, we denoted ∠BAD as α. So:

α = ∠BAC + β.

But in triangle ABC, the angles are:

At A: ∠BAC

At B: ∠ABC = 180° - z (earlier definition, but now with this approach?)

Wait, this seems getting complicated. Let me try to proceed.

From earlier, we had:

In triangle ABD, α + β = 119°.

In triangle CDA, same thing.

Also, from point C, ∠BCD = ∠BCA + ∠DCA = 61°, and ∠DCA = α, so ∠BCA = 61° - α.

Now, consider triangle ABC. Its angles are:

At A: ∠BAC = ?

At B: ∠ABC = ?

At C: ∠BCA = 61° - α

Sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180°, so:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + (61° - α) = 180°

But ∠BAC is part of ∠BAD = α, and ∠BAC = α - β (since ∠BAD = ∠BAC + β → ∠BAC = α - β).

So substituting:

(α - β) + ∠ABC + (61° - α) = 180°

Simplify:

α - β + ∠ABC + 61° - α = 180°

→ (-β) + ∠ABC + 61° = 180°

→ ∠ABC = 180° + β - 61° = 119° + β

But earlier, from the diagonal BD, we had ∠ABC = 180° - z, and from triangle BCD, we had ∠CBD = 119° - z. But this is under the assumption of similarity between triangles ABD and CDA.

Wait, but now we have ∠ABC = 119° + β.

But from triangle ABD, we had α + β = 119°, so β = 119° - α.

Substituting into ∠ABC:

∠ABC = 119° + (119° - α) = 238° - α

But we also have ∠BAD = α, and from earlier, in the quadrilateral, ∠BAD = z + 58°, where z = ∠CDB.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, but from triangle ABD, we also had ∠ADB = β = 119° - α.

But ∠ADB is part of ∠ADC = 61°, which is ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 61°, so:

β + z = 61° → (119° - α) + z = 61° → z = 61° - 119° + α = α - 58°.

But earlier, we had ∠ABC = 180° - z, so:

∠ABC = 180° - (α - 58°) = 180° - α + 58° = 238° - α

Which matches the earlier expression for ∠ABC = 238° - α.

So, this shows consistency, but still, we need to find α or z.

But how?

Wait, maybe using triangle ADC. Earlier, in triangle ADC, we had ∠DAC = β, ∠DCA = α, and ∠ADC = 61°, so:

β + α + 61° = 180° → α + β = 119°, which we already knew.

No new info.

But maybe combining with other equations.

We have ∠ABC = 238° - α, and we want to find ∠ABC.

But how to find α?

Wait, from earlier, z = α - 58°, and z is ∠CDB.

Also, from triangle BCD, we had ∠CBD = 119° - z = 119° - (α - 58°) = 119° - α + 58° = 177° - α.

But ∠CBD is part of ∠ABC, which is ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61° + (177° - α) = 238° - α, which matches ∠ABC = 238° - α. So again, consistent.

But still no way to determine α.

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship involving α?

Let me think about the entire quadrilateral. The angles at A, B, C, D are:

At A: ∠DAB = α

At B: ∠ABC = 238° - α

At C: ∠BCD = 61°

At D: ∠ADC = 61°

Sum: α + (238 - α) + 61 + 61 = α + 238 - α + 122 = 238 + 122 = 360°, which checks out.

Still no new info.

This suggests that there's infinite solutions depending on α, which contradicts the problem having a unique answer. Hence, my assumption that triangles ABD and CDA are similar might be incorrect, or there's another condition I missed.

Wait, but the problem provides enough information to determine ∠ABC, implying that there is a unique solution. So I must have missed something.

Let me revisit the initial problem statement. It says:

Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) with points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, CD, DA. Angles ABD, BCD, CDA are equal. Given m∠CDA = 61°, find m∠ABC.

Wait, maybe I misread the angles. Let me double-check:

Angle(A,B,D) is ∠ABD, Angle(B,C,D) is ∠BCD, Angle(C,D,A) is ∠CDA. And these three angles are equal. So ∠ABD = ∠BCD = ∠CDA = 61°.

But what about the fourth angle at A? ∠DAB?

Wait, in the quadrilateral, the sum of all four angles is 360°. So:

m∠DAB + m∠ABC + m∠BCD + m∠CDA = 360°

We know m∠BCD = 61°, m∠CDA = 61°, so:

m∠DAB + m∠ABC + 61 + 61 = 360 → m∠DAB + m∠ABC = 238°

But we need to find m∠ABC. To find this, we need to find m∠DAB.

But how?

Earlier, I tried relating m∠DAB with other angles via the diagonal BD. From that analysis, we had:

m∠DAB = ∠CDB + 58°, where ∠CDB is part of ∠CDA = 61°, so ∠CDB = 61° - ∠ADB.

But without knowing ∠ADB, this isn't helpful.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to express m∠DAB in terms of ∠ABC?

Let me think: from earlier, we had ∠ABC = 180° - z, where z = ∠CDB.

And m∠DAB = z + 58°.

So, adding m∠DAB + m∠ABC = (z + 58°) + (180° - z) = 238°, which matches the earlier equation. Still no new info.

Hmm. This suggests that without additional information, the value of ∠ABC cannot be uniquely determined. But the problem gives a unique answer, so I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the key lies in recognizing that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram or some other special type?

But with the given angles, it's unlikely. Or maybe it's a trapezoid?

Wait, if ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°, and ∠BCD = 61°, maybe there's some parallelism?

Alternatively, let's consider drawing the diagram with specific values.

Assume ∠CDA = 61°, so ∠ADC = 61°. Let's say in triangle ADC, we have ∠ADC = 61°, and let's assume it's an isoceles triangle, but without knowing sides, it's not helpful.

Wait, but if I take specific values. Let me try assigning some variables.

Let me denote:

Let ∠CDB = x. Then, from earlier:

∠ADC = ∠ADB + x = 61° → ∠ADB = 61° - x.

In triangle ABD: ∠ABD = 61°, ∠ADB = 61° - x, ∠BAD = 180 - 61 - (61 - x) = 180 - 61 - 61 + x = 58 + x.

So ∠BAD = x + 58°.

In triangle BCD: ∠BCD = 61°, ∠CDB = x, so ∠CBD = 180 - 61 - x = 119 - x.

Thus, ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61 + (119 - x) = 180 - x.

So ∠ABC = 180 - x.

Now, the sum of angles at A and B is:

∠DAB + ∠ABC = (x + 58) + (180 - x) = 238°, as before.

But we need to find ∠ABC = 180 - x. To find x, we need another equation.

But where is this equation?

Ah! Let's consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have angles at D: 61°, at A: ∠DAC, at C: ∠ACD.

But ∠DAC is part of ∠DAB = x + 58°. Let's denote ∠DAC = y, so ∠DAC = y, and ∠DAB = y + something?

Wait, ∠DAB is the angle at A between DA and BA. If we draw diagonal AC, then ∠DAC = y, and ∠BAC = ∠DAB - y = (x + 58) - y.

But in triangle ABC, we have angles at A: ∠BAC, at B: ∠ABC = 180 - x, and at C: ∠BCA.

Sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180°:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180°

→ [(x + 58) - y] + (180 - x) + ∠BCA = 180°

Simplify:

(x + 58 - y) + 180 - x + ∠BCA = 180

→ 58 - y + 180 + ∠BCA = 180

→ 58 - y + ∠BCA = 0

→ ∠BCA = y - 58°

But ∠BCA is an angle at C in triangle ABC, which is part of ∠BCD = 61°. Since ∠BCD is the angle at C between B and D, and if we draw diagonal AC, ∠BCA is part of ∠BCD. So:

∠BCA + ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 61°

From above, ∠BCA = y - 58°, so:

(y - 58°) + ∠ACD = 61°

→ ∠ACD = 61° - y + 58° = 119° - y

Now, in triangle ADC, we have angles:

At D: 61°, at A: y, at C: 119° - y.

Sum: 61 + y + (119 - y) = 180°, which checks out.

But how to relate y to other variables?

Wait, in triangle ADC, ∠ACD = 119° - y, and in triangle ABC, ∠BCA = y - 58°.

But I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, but ∠ACD is also part of the angle at C in the quadrilateral. Wait, ∠ACD is part of ∠BCD = 61°, which we've already used.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle ACD. Wait, we already did.

This seems like a loop. How to break it?

Wait, but in triangle ABD, we have ∠BAD = x + 58°, and ∠BAD = y + ∠BAC = y + [(x + 58) - y] = x + 58°, which is consistent.

But this doesn't help.

Wait, but in triangle ADC, ∠DAC = y, and ∠ADC = 61°, and ∠ACD = 119° - y.

But ∠DAC = y is part of ∠DAB = x + 58°, so y ≤ x + 58°.

But without more constraints, this is not helpful.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between y and x?

Wait, from earlier, in triangle ADC, ∠ACD = 119° - y, and in triangle ABC, ∠BCA = y - 58°. But ∠BCA is also part of ∠BCD = 61°, so:

∠BCA = y - 58°, and ∠BCA + ∠ACD = 61°, which gives:

y - 58° + 119° - y = 61° → 61° = 61°, which is always true. So no new info.

This means that y can be any value, leading to multiple possibilities for x and hence for ∠ABC. But the problem has a single answer, so this suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, but the problem says "quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)" with the given angles. Maybe it's a specific type of quadrilateral, like a kite or something?

Wait, if ∠ABD = ∠BCD = ∠CDA = 61°, and if it's a kite, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe all sides are equal? Not necessarily.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that ∠ABD is part of ∠ABC. Let me confirm.

Yes, ∠ABD is the angle at B between A and D, so it is part of the larger angle ∠ABC, which is at B between A and C. So ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC.

Wait, earlier I called ∠CBD as ∠DBC, which is part of ∠ABC.

So, ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61° + (119° - x) = 180° - x, as before.

But if I can find x, I can find ∠ABC.

Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe considering the triangle ABD and triangle CDB?

Wait, in triangle ABD, we have ∠ABD = 61°, ∠BAD = x + 58°, ∠ADB = 61° - x.

In triangle CDB, ∠BCD = 61°, ∠CDB = x, ∠CBD = 119° - x.

If these triangles are congruent or similar, but without side ratios, it's hard to say.

Wait, but if we assume that AD = CB, or some sides are equal, but there's no information about sides.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines in both triangles.

In triangle ABD:

AD / sin(61°) = AB / sin(∠ADB) = AB / sin(61° - x)

In triangle CDB:

CB / sin(x) = CD / sin(119° - x) = CD / sin(∠CBD)

But without knowing any side lengths, this seems unhelpful.

Wait, but maybe there's a ratio between AD and CB?

If we assume that AD/AB = CB/CD, but again, no basis for this.

This seems like a dead end.

Wait, but the problem must have a unique solution, so there must be a way to find x.

Let me think outside the box. Maybe the quadrilateral is such that AB is parallel to CD, or some other condition?

If AB is parallel to CD, then ∠ABD and ∠CDA might be related, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°, and ∠BCD = 61°, maybe the quadrilateral is symmetric in some way?

If I imagine a quadrilateral where AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC, making it a parallelogram. But in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But here, we have three angles equal to 61°, which would mean the fourth angle would be 360 - 3*61 = 360 - 183 = 177°, which doesn't fit with the given data. So probably not a parallelogram.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trapezoid with AB parallel to CD.

In that case, ∠ABD and ∠CDA would be alternate angles, but I need to check.

If AB || CD, then ∠ABD and ∠CDA would be alternate interior angles, which would make them equal. Yes! This fits with the given condition that ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°.

So if AB is parallel to CD, then this condition holds. Let's assume that AB || CD.

If that's the case, then it's a trapezoid with bases AB and CD. Let's proceed with this assumption.

So, AB || CD, making it a trapezoid. Now, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So ∠A + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

Wait, let me confirm: in a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, the legs are AD and BC. The angles at A and D are on base AD, and angles at B and C are on base BC.

Wait, actually, in a trapezoid, each pair of adjacent angles on the same base are supplementary. Wait, no: the consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary.

For example, ∠A and ∠D are on the left side, and if AB || CD, then ∠A and ∠D are on the same leg AD, and they are supplementary. Similarly, ∠B and ∠C are supplementary.

Wait, let me recall: in a trapezoid, each pair of angles on the same side (i.e., adjacent angles) are supplementary. So ∠A + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

But in our case, we have ∠CDA = 61°, which is ∠D, and ∠BCD = 61°, which is ∠C. So if ∠C = 61°, then ∠B = 180° - ∠C = 119°.

But ∠B is ∠ABC, which is what we're supposed to find. Wait, but this would suggest ∠ABC = 119°, which is not one of the answer choices. The options are 55, 69, 85, 140. So 119 isn't there. So either this assumption is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, but if AB || CD, then ∠D = ∠ADC = 61°, and ∠A + ∠D = 180°, so ∠A = 180 - 61 = 119°. ∠A is ∠DAB, which is part of the quadrilateral. But we also have ∠ABD = 61°, which is part of ∠A.

Wait, ∠ABD is part of ∠A. So ∠ABD = 61°, and ∠ABD is part of ∠DAB. So ∠DAB = ∠ABD + ∠BAD? No, ∠DAB is the whole angle at A. Wait, ∠ABD is part of ∠ABC, not ∠DAB. Wait, no: ∠ABD is at point B, not at point A.

Wait, I think I confused the angles. Let me clarify:

If AB || CD, then ∠A and ∠D are supplementary. ∠A is ∠DAB, and ∠D is ∠ADC = 61°, so ∠DAB = 180 - 61 = 119°.

Now, in this trapezoid, ∠DAB = 119°, ∠ADC = 61°, ∠BCD = 61°, and ∠ABC = ?.

Since ∠B + ∠C = 180°, and ∠C = 61°, so ∠B = 180 - 61 = 119°, so ∠ABC = 119°, which is not among the options. Hence, this suggests that the assumption of AB || CD is incorrect.

But why did I think ∠ABD = ∠CDA would imply AB || CD? Because in that case, ∠ABD and ∠CDA would be alternate interior angles. But ∠ABD is at B, and ∠CDA is at D, so if AB || CD, then the transversal BD would create alternate interior angles. But ∠ABD and ∠CDA are not necessarily alternate interior angles unless BD is the transversal.

Wait, if AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, then ∠ABD and ∠CDB would be alternate interior angles. But the problem states that ∠ABD = ∠CDA, not ∠CDB. So this might not hold.

So, maybe my assumption is wrong.

But this suggests that there's a relationship between ∠ABD and ∠CDA through some parallel lines.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonal BD creates some isosceles triangles?

If ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°, and if some sides are equal, but again, without side lengths, it's hard to say.

Wait, but let's try to assume that triangles ABD and CDA are congruent. If that's the case, then corresponding sides and angles would be equal.

If ∠ABD = ∠CDA = 61°, and if AD = CD, AB = CA, etc., but this is speculative.

Alternatively, if AB = CD and AD = BC, making it a parallelogram, but as before, leads to contradictions.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of a different approach.

Let me recall that in the beginning, we had ∠ABC = 180° - x, where x = ∠CDB. And we also had from the sum of angles in the quadrilateral, but no way to find x.

But if I consider that in triangle BCD, ∠CDB = x, and in triangle ABD, ∠ADB = 61° - x. Also, in triangle ADC, ∠ADC = 61° = ∠ADB + ∠CDB = (61° - x) + x = 61°, which is always true. So no help.

Wait, but what if I consider the triangle ABD and triangle CBD?

Wait, in triangle ABD: sides are AB, BD, AD.

In triangle CBD: sides are CB, BD, CD.

If these triangles are congruent, then corresponding sides and angles would be equal. For example, if AB = CB, BD = BD, and AD = CD, then triangles ABD and CBD would be congruent by SSS. If that's the case, then ∠ABD = ∠CBD, but ∠ABD = 61°, so ∠CBD = 61°, which would make ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 122°, which is not in the options.

But this is assuming congruence, which might not be valid.

Alternatively, if AB = CD and AD = CB, making it a parallelogram, but as before, this leads to conflicts.

Alternatively, maybe AD = CB, and AB = CD, making it a parallelogram, but again, leading to ∠ABC = 119°, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, let's try plugging in the answer choices and see which one makes sense.

The options are A. 55, B. 69, C. 85, D. 140.

Let me assume that the correct answer is B. 69°, and see if it fits.

If ∠ABC = 69°, then from earlier, ∠ABC = 180° - x → x = 180 - 69 = 111°.

So x = ∠CDB = 111°.

But ∠CDA = 61° = ∠ADB + ∠CDB = (61° - x) + x = 61°, which is true. So no contradiction here.

But how does this help?

Wait, from earlier, ∠BAD = x + 58° = 111 + 58 = 169°. So ∠DAB = 169°.

Then, the sum of angles at A and B is 169 + 69 = 238°, which matches.

But this doesn't help us verify if this is correct.

Alternatively, let's assume ∠ABC = 140° (option D). Then x = 180 - 140 = 40°.

So ∠CDB = 40°, and ∠ADB = 61 - 40 = 21°.

Then, ∠BAD = 40 + 58 = 98°.

Sum of angles at A and B: 98 + 140 = 238°, which is okay.

But how to determine which is correct?

Wait, let's consider that in triangle ABD, ∠ABD = 61°, ∠ADB = 21°, ∠BAD = 98°. These add to 61 + 21 + 98 = 180°, which is correct.

In triangle BCD, ∠BCD = 61°, ∠CDB = 40°, so ∠CBD = 180 - 61 - 40 = 79°. Then ∠ABC = 61 + 79 = 140°, which is option D.

But how to know if this is correct?

Without more information, it's impossible to know. But since the problem provides a unique answer, and the calculation is consistent, but how to decide?

Wait, but in this scenario, the angles in the quadrilateral would be:

At A: 98°, at B: 140°, at C: 61°, at D: 61°. Total: 98 + 140 + 61 + 61 = 360°, which is correct.

But this is possible. But why would this be the correct answer?

Alternatively, let's try option C: 85°.

If ∠ABC = 85°, then x = 180 - 85 = 95°.

Then, ∠CDB = 95°, ∠ADB = 61 - 95 = -34°, which is impossible. So this is invalid.

Option A: 55°. Then x = 180 - 55 = 125°. ∠ADB = 61 - 125 = -64°, also impossible.

Option B: 69°, x = 111°, ∠ADB = 61 - 111 = -50°, also impossible.

Wait, this is a problem! All options except D give negative ∠ADB, which is impossible.

Wait, this suggests that only option D gives a positive ∠ADB.

Let me recheck:

If ∠ABC = 140°, then x = 180 - 140 = 40°.

∠ADB = 61° - x = 61 - 40 = 21°, which is positive. So this is possible.

Other options:

Option B: 69° → x = 111°, ∠ADB = 61 - 111 = -50°, invalid.

Option A: 55° → x = 125°, ∠ADB = -64°, invalid.

Option C: 85° → x = 95°, ∠ADB = -34°, invalid.

Only option D gives valid positive angle. So the answer must be D. 140°.

But why? Because it's the only one that gives a positive ∠ADB.

But wait, this suggests that the answer is D. 140°, even though the reasoning was based on assuming that ∠ABC = 180 - x, and x = ∠CDB. But how does this fit with the diagram?

Let me verify with x = 40°, ∠CDB = 40°, ∠ADB = 21°.

In triangle ABD, angles are 61°, 21°, and 98° (since ∠BAD = x + 58 = 40 + 58 = 98°). Sum is 61 + 21 + 98 = 180°, correct.

In triangle BCD, angles are 61°, 40°, and 180 - 61 - 40 = 79°, so ∠CBD = 79°. Then ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 61 + 79 = 140°, which is option D.

This is consistent and gives all angles positive.

Hence, the correct answer is D. 140°.

But why did I previously think it might be 119°? Because of the trapezoid assumption, which led to inconsistency. But this method shows that only option D is possible.

So the correct answer is D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric setup and the relationships defined by the given angles:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with the following structure:

- Vertices: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$
- Sides: $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CD}$, $\overline{DA}$
- Diagonal: $\overline{BD}$, forming two triangles: $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCD$

We are told:

- $\angle ABD = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = 61^\circ$
- The goal is to find $\angle ABC$

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle Relationships**

#### **Triangle $BCD$:**
$$
\angle BCD = 61^\circ,\quad \angle CDB = x, \quad \angle CBD = ?
$$
Using the triangle angle sum:
$$
\angle BCD + \angle CDB + \angle CBD = 180^\circ \\
61^\circ + x + \angle CBD = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle CBD = 119^\circ - x
$$

#### **Triangle $ABD$:**
$$
\angle ABD = 61^\circ, \quad \angle ADB = ?, \quad \angle BAD = ?
$$
From the angle sum:
$$
\angle ABD + \angle ADB + \angle BAD = 180^\circ \\
61^\circ + \angle ADB + \angle BAD = 180^\circ
$$

Also, since $\angle ADB + \angle CDB = \angle CDA = 61^\circ$, we get:
$$
\angle ADB = 61^\circ - x
$$

Plugging this into the triangle $ABD$ angle sum:
$$
61^\circ + (61^\circ - x) + \angle BAD = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle BAD = 58^\circ + x
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find $\angle ABC$ Using the Breakdown of Angle at Vertex B**

At vertex $B$, the angle $\angle ABC$ consists of two components:
- $\angle ABD = 61^\circ$
- $\angle CBD = 119^\circ - x$

So,
$$
\angle ABC = \angle ABD + \angle CBD = 61^\circ + (119^\circ - x) = 180^\circ - x
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use the Total Internal Angle of the Quadrilateral**

The total internal angle of a quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. The known angles are:
- $\angle CDA = 61^\circ$
- $\angle BCD = 61^\circ$
- $\angle ABC = 180^\circ - x$
- $\angle DAB = 58^\circ + x$

So:
$$
\angle DAB + \angle ABC + \angle BCD + \angle CDA = 360^\circ \\
(58^\circ + x) + (180^\circ - x) + 61^\circ + 61^\circ = 360^\circ
$$
All variable terms cancel out, confirming the configuration is internally consistent.

---

### **Step 5: Determine $\angle ABC$ Based on the Options**

Recall:
$$
\angle ABC = 180^\circ - x
$$
We test each answer choice to determine a valid $x$ that results in positive angles in the triangles.

#### Try Option D: $140^\circ$
$$
\angle ABC = 140^\circ \Rightarrow x = 180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ
$$

Check if this yields valid triangle angles:

- In $\triangle BCD$:
  - $\angle CDB = x = 40^\circ$
  - $\angle BCD = 61^\circ$
  - $\angle CBD = 119^\circ - x = 79^\circ$
    - Check: $61^\circ + 40^\circ + 79^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅

- In $\triangle ABD$:
  - $\angle ABD = 61^\circ$
  - $\angle ADB = 61^\circ - x = 21^\circ$
  - $\angle BAD = 58^\circ + x = 98^\circ$
    - Check: $61^\circ + 21^\circ + 98^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅

All angles remain positive and valid. This confirms that the configuration is consistent.

---

### **Conclusion**

Among the given choices, **only Option D** produces valid angles in all triangles and satisfies all geometric constraints. Other options lead to negative or inconsistent angles.

---

### Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
