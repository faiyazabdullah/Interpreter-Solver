MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question says that GJ is a diameter of circle K. We need to find the measure of arc GLJ. The answer choices are A. 90, B. 120, C. 180, D. 360. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Since GJ is a diameter, that means points G and J are on the circle, and the line segment connecting them passes through the center K. Wait, so point K is the center of the circle? Because the circle is named as ⊙K, right? So yes, K is the center. That makes sense because a diameter connects two points on the circle passing through the center.

Now, angle GKH... wait, the problem mentions Angle(G,K,J). Let me parse that. The angle at point K between points G and J. So angle G-K-J. But since GJ is a diameter, then angle GKL would be related to something else. Wait, maybe there's more information here. Let me check again.

The problem states that GJ is a diameter of ⊙K. Then we have points H and L mentioned. Wait, but the original problem mentions points H and L, but the angle given is Angle(G,K,J), which is angle at K between G and J. Also, there's a mention of MeasureOf(Angle(K) Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J)). Hmm, maybe that part refers to another angle?

Wait, perhaps there was a typo or missing information? Let me re-read the problem carefully.

Original problem:

Given geometric constraints:
- Circle(K)
- Point(G)
- Point(J)
- Point(H)
- Point(L)
- Line(G,J)
- Angle(G,K,J)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K)
- Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J))

Then the question is to find m∠GLJ (arc measure? Or angle measure?) Wait, the question says "Find m ∠GLJ." Wait, no—wait, the notation might be confusing. In the problem statement, it's written as m \widehat{GLJ}, which usually denotes the measure of the arc GLJ. However, sometimes angles can be denoted similarly. But since it's a circle, and GLJ is likely an arc. Wait, but GLJ would be three points. If it's an arc, then maybe it's from G to J passing through L? Or is L another point on the circle?

But the problem gives points G, J, H, L. So points H and L are also on the circle? Maybe. Since they're mentioned in the context of the circle. But the problem isn't giving much detail about their positions except for the line GJ and angle at K.

Let me focus on the main question: Find m∠GLJ. Wait, the user wrote "m \widehat{GLJ}", which is arc measure. But maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe it's angle GLJ? Let me think.

Assuming that it's asking for the measure of arc GLJ. But arcs are typically named with two endpoints, unless it's a major arc or something. For example, if you have points G, L, J on the circle, then arc GLJ would be the arc starting at G, going through L to J. But without knowing where L is located, how can we determine its measure?

Alternatively, maybe there's a diagram associated with this problem that we don't have access to. But since we don't have a diagram, we need to infer based on the given constraints.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(G,K,J) which is angle at K between G and J. Since GJ is a diameter, and K is the center, then angle G-K-J is actually a straight line, making angle G-K-J equal to 180 degrees. Wait, but that seems trivial. Unless there's another angle involved. Wait, the problem also has a subtract operation: Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J)) from MeasureOf(Angle(K))? Wait, the original text says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K)
Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J)"

Hmm, this seems like a possible error in transcription. Maybe it's supposed to say that the measure of angle K (maybe angle at K?) minus the measure of angle G-K-J equals something? Or maybe the measure of angle GKL minus angle G-K-J?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angle at point K, but that's unclear. Given that the problem is translated into a mathematical expression with MeasureOf(Angle(K)), which could mean angle at point K, but that's ambiguous. Maybe there was a formatting issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to state that angle GKL is being compared to angle G-K-J? But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, the main question is about finding the measure of arc GLJ.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to standard ones where if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle with one side as diameter. For instance, Thales' theorem says that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that diameter is a right angle.

But how does that relate to the current problem? Let me think again.

Since GJ is a diameter of the circle with center K, then any triangle formed with G and J as endpoints of the diameter and a third point on the circle will be a right triangle. For example, if we take point L on the circle, then triangle GLJ would be a right triangle with right angle at L. Therefore, angle GLJ would be 90 degrees. Wait, but that's angle at L, not sure if that's what's asked here.

But the question asks for m\widehat{GLJ}. If that's the measure of arc GLJ, then depending on where L is, that could vary. But if we assume that L is such that GLJ is a right triangle, then the arc from G to J would be 180 degrees, since GJ is a diameter. But the arc GLJ would depend on where L is. Wait, if L is somewhere on the circle, then arc GLJ would be the sum of arc GL plus arc LJ. But without knowing where L is, it's impossible to know.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using angle measures related to central angles or inscribed angles. Let me consider that.

If angle at K, which is the center, then the measure of the central angle over arc GJ would be 180 degrees since GJ is a diameter. But if there's another angle involving point L, maybe?

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves some subtraction of angles. Let me go back to the initial constraints. There's an expression: Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J) from MeasureOf(Angle(K)...). Wait, maybe the problem is saying that the measure of angle K (which is at point K) minus the measure of angle G-K-J equals something? But angle G-K-J is already 180 degrees if GJ is a diameter. If angle K is referring to another angle, maybe?

This part is confusing due to the possibly mistranslated or formatted expression. Perhaps the problem originally had a specific angle measure that's being subtracted. For example, if there was an angle at point K, say angle GKHL or something, but without more details, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angle GKL. Suppose there's a point L such that angle GKL is being considered. For example, if L is a point on the circle, then KL is a radius. Since K is the center, KL = KG = KJ, as radii.

But without knowing where L is, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the answer choices include 90, 120, 180, 360, and considering common circle problems, maybe the arc measure is 120 degrees or 90 degrees.

Wait, if we consider that angle GLJ is an inscribed angle. Suppose that L is a point on the circle such that when connected to G and J, forms an inscribed angle. If GJ is the diameter, then the inscribed angle subtended by GJ would be 90 degrees. But if the arc is different...

Alternatively, suppose that the measure of arc GLJ is twice the measure of angle at L. But again, without knowing where L is, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe there's a way to connect the given information. The problem includes points H and L. Maybe there's a diagram where H and L are positioned such that certain angles are defined. For example, if H is another point on the circle, forming triangle GHK or something. But since we don't have the diagram, we need to make assumptions.

Another approach: since GJ is a diameter, the total circumference corresponds to 360 degrees. Arc GJ is 180 degrees. If we have another point L on the circle, then the position of L determines the measure of arc GLJ. If L is placed such that it divides the circle into specific arcs.

But the question is about m\widehat{GLJ}, which would be the arc from G to J passing through L. If L is anywhere on the circle, this arc would be either minor or major. But if the problem implies that the arc is specifically the major arc, then it could be 360 minus the minor arc. But without knowing the exact location of L, we can't determine.

However, since the problem provides answer choices including 180, which is the measure of the semicircle, and 90, 120, etc., maybe there's a clue in the given constraints.

Wait, the initial problem mentions Angle(G,K,J). Which is angle at K between G and J. Since GJ is a diameter, that angle is a straight angle, i.e., 180 degrees. Then, the problem mentions Subtract(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J) from MeasureOf(Angle(K)...). Assuming that MeasureOf(Angle(K) refers to another angle at point K. But without knowing which angle, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there was a misformatting, and the intended meaning is that angle at K is being compared to angle G-K-J. If angle at K is referring to another angle, say angle GKL, then maybe.

For example, suppose there's a triangle GKL where angle at K is some value, and angle G-K-J is 180 degrees. Then subtracting those might give us some relation. But without more info, it's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about an inscribed angle. If there's an angle at L subtended by arc GJ, then that angle would be half the measure of the arc. Since arc GJ is 180 degrees, the inscribed angle would be 90 degrees. Thus, angle GLJ would be 90 degrees. Hence, if the question is asking for the measure of angle GLJ, then the answer would be 90 degrees, option A.

But the question says m\widehat{GLJ}, which is arc measure. If that's the case, then arc GLJ would be the same as arc GJ, which is 180 degrees. But that would be option C. But why would the answer be 180? It depends on whether L is on the arc or not.

Wait, if the arc GLJ is the entire semicircle, then it's 180 degrees. But if L is somewhere else, like if L is diametrically opposed to some point, then it could vary. However, since the problem mentions points H and L, but no specifics, it's hard to tell.

But given that the answer choices include 90, 120, 180, 360, and considering that in many cases, if you have a diameter and an inscribed angle, the angle is 90 degrees. But the question is about the arc measure. So if the angle is 90 degrees, then the arc it subtends would be 180 degrees. Wait, inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc. So if the inscribed angle is 90 degrees, then the arc is 180 degrees. But that would correspond to the semicircle.

Alternatively, if the arc measure is 120 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be 60 degrees. But how do we get 120?

Maybe there's more information implied. Let me think again. The problem includes points H and L. Maybe there's a specific construction. For example, if H is the midpoint of the arc GJ, then the arc measure would be 180 degrees. But again, without knowing where L is, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the key lies in the initial angle measurements. If there's an angle at K, say angle GKH, and angle G-K-J is 180 degrees, and then subtracting that from another angle... But without knowing which angle, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referencing an angle at point K, which is the center. If angle at K is referring to angle GKL, and if we subtract angle G-K-J (which is 180 degrees), then maybe. For example, if angle GKL is x, and we subtract 180°, leading to x - 180°, but this is just speculation.

At this point, I'm stuck because the problem lacks clarity, especially regarding the angle measurements and the position of point L. However, since the question is about arc GLJ and GJ is a diameter, the most straightforward assumption is that arc GLJ spans from G to J passing through L. If L is on the circle such that the arc GLJ is a semicircle, then it's 180°, which is option C. But if L is positioned such that the arc is larger than 180°, then it could be more than 180°, but since 360 is an option, but that would only be if the arc is the whole circle, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, if angle GLJ is an inscribed angle subtending arc GJ, then it's 90°, but the question is about the arc measure. Wait, if angle GLJ is an inscribed angle, then the measure of the arc it subtends is twice the angle. So if angle GLJ is θ, then the arc measure is 2θ. But if angle GLJ is 90°, then arc measure is 180°, which would be option C. But how do we know angle GLJ is 90°?

Ah! If L is any point on the circle not on the diameter GJ, then triangle GLJ is a right triangle with right angle at L, by Thales' theorem. Hence, angle GLJ is 90°, which would imply that the arc subtended by GJ is 180°, which is the measure of arc GJ. But the question asks for arc GLJ. If arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L, then it's the same as arc GJ, which is 180°, hence option C. But wait, if L is on the circle, then arc GLJ would be the arc from G to J passing through L. Depending on where L is, this could be the major arc or minor arc. But since GJ is a diameter, the minor arc GJ is 180°, and the major arc GJ would be 180° + the rest. But without knowing where L is, it's ambiguous. However, if L is on the circumference, then arc GLJ would be either minor or major arc. But since the problem didn't specify, but the answer choices include 180°, which is the measure of the minor arc, and 360° is full circle.

But given that the answer is likely expecting the minor arc, and the presence of Thales' theorem implying that angle GLJ is 90°, which corresponds to the arc GJ being 180°, then the measure of arc GLJ is 180°, so answer C.

But wait, maybe the arc GLJ is not GJ, but a different arc. Like, if L is a point such that the arc goes from G to L to J. For example, if L is a point on the circle such that GL and LJ form parts of the arc. But without knowing where L is, we can't determine. However, given the lack of information, the most logical conclusion is that arc GLJ is the semicircle, hence 180°, option C.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angle at L, which is 90°, and the question is mistyped, and it should be asking for the measure of angle GLJ instead of the arc. In that case, the answer would be 90°, option A. But since the question specifies m\widehat{GLJ}, which is arc measure, I think it's more likely to be 180°, option C.

But wait, another thought: if GLJ is an arc, then the measure of the arc is determined by the central angle. If the arc is GLJ, then the central angle would be the angle at K between points G and J, which is 180°, since GJ is a diameter. Hence, the arc measure is 180°, so answer C.

Yes, that makes sense. So regardless of where L is, the arc from G to J passing through L would be the same as arc GJ, which is 180°, because L is on the circle. Wait, but if L is on the arc GJ, then the arc GLJ would be the same as arc GJ. If L is elsewhere, then it would be a different arc. But since the problem doesn't specify, but mentions point L, maybe it's part of a specific configuration.

But given the limited information and the most probable scenario, the arc measure is 180°, so answer C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup described in the problem.

### **Key Geometric Facts**

1. **Circle Properties**:
   - The circle is denoted as $ \odot K $, indicating that **point $ K $ is the center** of the circle.
   - Points $ G $ and $ J $ lie on the circle, and the segment $ GJ $ is explicitly stated to be a **diameter**, which means:
     - Segment $ GJ $ passes through the center $ K $,
     - The length of $ GJ $ is twice the radius,
     - The angle $ \angle G-K-J $ is a **straight angle**, i.e., $ 180^\circ $.

2. **Arc Measure**:
   - The measure of an arc corresponding to a **central angle** is **equal to the measure of that central angle**.
   - Since $ GJ $ is a diameter, the arc $ \widehat{GJ} $ is a **semicircle** with a measure of $ 180^\circ $.

3. **Inference About Point $ L $**:
   - While the exact position of point $ L $ is not specified, it’s implied that it lies on the circle (as it appears in the arc notation $ \widehat{GLJ} $).
   - The arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ is interpreted as the arc from point $ G $ to point $ J $, **passing through point $ L $** — which is consistent with the definition of an arc spanning across multiple points on the circle.

---

### **Conclusion Based on Geometry**

- Since $ GJ $ is a **diameter**, the arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ represents the **same arc as $ \widehat{GJ} $** (because $ L $ lies on the circle and is part of the arc from $ G $ to $ J $).
- Therefore, the measure of arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ is the same as the measure of arc $ \widehat{GJ} $, which is a **semicircle**.

$$
\text{Measure of } \widehat{GLJ} = 180^\circ
