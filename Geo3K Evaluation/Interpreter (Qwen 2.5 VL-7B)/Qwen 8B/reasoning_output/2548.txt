MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a rectangle DEFG. The question is asking for the measure of angle EDF, which is given as 5x - 3, and another angle, DF G, which is 3x + 7. Hmm, first I need to recall some properties of rectangles. 

Wait, rectangles have four right angles, right? So each angle inside a rectangle should be 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions angles EDF and DFG. Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me try to sketch it mentally. Points D, E, F, G forming a rectangle. So, assuming the order is such that D is connected to E and G, E is connected to D and F, F is connected to E and G, and G is connected to F and D. Wait, maybe I should label the rectangle properly.

Let me think. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, if we consider point D, then lines DE and DG would be adjacent sides. Then angle at D would be between DE and DG. Wait, but the angles mentioned here are angle EDF and angle DFG. Let me clarify.

First, angle EDF: that's the angle at point D, between points E, D, F. So, since D is a vertex, connecting E to D to F. Since it's a rectangle, DE and DF would be two adjacent sides meeting at D. Therefore, angle EDF should be one of the internal angles of the rectangle. But wait, in a rectangle, all internal angles are 90 degrees. So why are they giving expressions in terms of x?

Wait, maybe there's something wrong here. Maybe the problem isn't referring to the internal angles directly? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the angles are defined?

Wait, let me check again. The problem says Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. Then, Angle(E,D,F) is angle at D between E and F. Similarly, Angle(F,D,G) is angle at D between F and G. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, angle notation: Angle(E,D,F) means the angle at point D, formed by points E, D, F. Similarly, Angle(F,D,G) would be the angle at point D formed by points F, D, G. Wait, but in a rectangle, the angles at D should be 90 degrees. So both angles EDF and FDG would be parts of the angle at D?

But wait, in a rectangle, each corner has a single angle of 90 degrees. How can there be two different angles at the same point D? Unless... unless these angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle, but rather something else. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to angles formed by diagonals?

Oh! Wait, maybe the problem involves the diagonals of the rectangle. Because in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are congruent. So, if you draw a diagonal from D to F, splitting the rectangle into two triangles. Then, angle EDF might be part of triangle DEF, and angle FDG could be part of triangle DGF?

Wait, let me think again. Suppose we have rectangle DEFG. Let's assume the order of the vertices is D-E-F-G-D. So, sides DE, EF, FG, GD. Then, the diagonals would be DF and EG. So, if we take diagonal DF, connecting D to F. Now, angle EDF is the angle at D between ED and DF. And angle FDG is the angle at D between FD and DG. So, those two angles (EDF and FDG) together make up the entire angle at D of the rectangle. Which is 90 degrees. So, angle EDF + angle FDG = 90 degrees. Wait, because the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle at D into two angles. Therefore, their sum should be 90 degrees.

So according to the problem, angle EDF is 5x - 3, and angle FDG is 3x + 7. Therefore:

(5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 90

Combine like terms:

5x + 3x = 8x

-3 +7 = 4

Therefore:

8x + 4 = 90

Subtract 4 from both sides:

8x = 86

Divide by 8:

x = 86 / 8 = 10.75

Then, substitute back into angle EDF: 5x -3 = 5*(10.75) -3 = 53.75 -3 = 50.75 degrees. Wait, but none of the answer choices are close to that. The choices are 22, 45, 68, 90. That suggests that my assumption may be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angles. Let me check again. The problem states:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,F)) and MeasureOf(Angle(F,D,G)). Wait, angle EDF is angle at D between E and F. Angle FDG is angle at D between F and G. So, adding them gives the total angle at D, which is 90 degrees. So according to that equation, solving gives x=10.75, leading to angle EDF being ~50.75, which is not among the choices. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my reasoning must be incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem refers to angles formed by the diagonals and sides? For example, in a rectangle, the diagonals create angles with the sides. However, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but they don't necessarily split the angles into equal parts unless it's a square.

Wait, but if the rectangle is not a square, the diagonals will split the angles into unequal parts. For instance, suppose the rectangle has length longer than width, so the diagonal divides the angle into two angles. Let me denote that. Let me call angle EDF as one part, and angle FDG as another part. But in that case, the sum of those two angles would still be 90 degrees. So same equation as before. Hence, same result. But the answer does not match. So perhaps there is a mistake in interpreting the angles?

Wait, maybe the angles are not at point D? Let me re-examine the notation. Angle(E,D,F): This is angle at D, between E and F. So yes, that's the angle at D. Similarly, angle(F,D,G) is angle at D between F and G. So same point D. So adding them gives the total angle at D. So that seems correct. But then why is the answer not matching?

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says:

"Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m∠EDF = 5x − 3 and m∠DFG = 3x + 7, find m∠EDF."

Wait, hold on, the second angle is written as ∠DFG. Is that angle at F? Wait, angle DFG would be angle at F, between D, F, G. Oh! Wait, that changes everything!

I think I made a mistake earlier in interpreting the second angle. The problem says "m∠DFG". So that's angle at F, between D, F, G. Not at D. So angle DFG is at point F, not at D. That's a critical error in my previous analysis. So my initial assumption was wrong. So let me redo the analysis.

So, quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. So, points D, E, F, G arranged such that DEFG is a rectangle. So, sides DE, EF, FG, GD. Angles at each corner are 90 degrees.

Now, angle EDF: that's angle at D between E, D, F. As before, that is one of the angles formed by the diagonal DF. So, if we draw diagonal DF, then angle EDF is part of triangle D-E-F. Similarly, angle DFG is angle at F between D, F, G. So, angle DFG is at point F, between D, F, G. Let me visualize this.

At point F, the rectangle has sides EF and FG. So angle at F is 90 degrees. But angle DFG is the angle at F between D, F, G. Wait, but D is connected to F via diagonal DF. So, angle DFG is the angle at F between side FG and diagonal DF. So, that's an angle inside the rectangle, at point F, between FG and DF.

Similarly, angle EDF is at point D, between ED and DF.

So, perhaps we need to use properties related to triangles within the rectangle.

Since DEFG is a rectangle, so DF is a diagonal. So triangle DFG is a triangle with vertices D, F, G. In this triangle, angle at F is angle DFG, which is given as 3x+7. Also, triangle D-E-F has angle at D, which is angle EDF, given as 5x-3.

But how do these relate? Let's see.

In triangle DFG: We know that in a rectangle, DF is a diagonal, so triangle DFG is a right triangle? Wait, no. Let me think. Point G is connected to F and D. So triangle DFG has sides DF, FG, and DG. Wait, but FG is a side of the rectangle, so FG is perpendicular to EF. However, DG is another side. Wait, maybe triangle DFG is not a right triangle. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle DFG and triangle DEF.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. So, DF and EG are diagonals. Also, in a rectangle, the diagonals divide it into two congruent triangles. So, triangle D-E-F and triangle D-G-F?

Wait, if DF is a diagonal, then triangles DEF and DGF are congruent? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Actually, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily bisecting the angles unless it's a square. So, the angles created by the diagonals depend on the rectangle's side lengths.

So, for example, in triangle D-E-F, angle at D is angle EDF = 5x -3. In triangle D-F-G, angle at F is angle DFG = 3x +7. Perhaps we can relate these angles through the properties of the rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle DFG. Since FG is a side of the rectangle, and DF is the diagonal, and DG is another side. Wait, DG is a side of the rectangle. Wait, DG connects D to G. In rectangle DEFG, DG is one of the sides? No, DG would be the side from D to G. Wait, in rectangle DEFG, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So DG is a side? Wait, no, DG is a side only if the rectangle is labeled in order. Let me confirm the order of the rectangle.

Assuming the rectangle is labeled in order, so consecutive points are connected. So, starting at D, connected to E, then E to F, F to G, G back to D. So, sides DE, EF, FG, GD. So, DG is a diagonal? Wait, no. From D to G would be a diagonal if it's a rectangle. Wait, no. If it's a rectangle, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So DG is actually a diagonal? Wait, no. If you go from D to G, that skips over E and F. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are adjacent. So DG would be a side only if the rectangle is labeled differently. Wait, confusion arises from the labeling.

Maybe I should assign coordinates to the rectangle to better understand the positions.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose DE is along the x-axis and DG is along the y-axis. So, point D is (0,0), E is (a,0), G is (0,b), and F is (a,b), completing the rectangle. So, sides DE = a units, DG = b units, EF = b units, FG = a units.

Now, diagonal DF connects D(0,0) to F(a,b). So, the slope of DF is b/a. 

Angle EDF is the angle at D between DE and DF. DE is along the x-axis from D(0,0) to E(a,0), and DF goes from D(0,0) to F(a,b). So, angle EDF is the angle between the x-axis and the diagonal DF. Similarly, angle DFG is the angle at F between DF and FG.

Let me calculate these angles. First, angle EDF. The tangent of angle EDF is equal to the opposite over adjacent in the triangle formed by D, E, and projection of F onto DE. Wait, more precisely, in triangle D-E-F, but actually, it's a right triangle? Wait, no, triangle D-E-F is not a right triangle. Wait, DF is the hypotenuse. Wait, but angle EDF is part of the triangle D-E-F. Let me compute tan(angle EDF).

From point D, the line DE is horizontal, and DF makes an angle θ with DE. The slope of DF is rise over run, which is b/a. So tan(theta) = (opposite)/(adjacent) = b/a. Therefore, theta = arctan(b/a). So, angle EDF = arctan(b/a). Similarly, angle DFG is at point F, between DF and FG.

Looking at point F(a,b). FG is the side from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is horizontal to the left. DF is the diagonal from F(a,b) to D(0,0). So, at point F, FG is going horizontally left, and DF is going down to D(0,0). So, angle DFG is the angle between FG (which is horizontal) and DF.

To find this angle, we can consider the slope of DF. From F(a,b) to D(0,0), the vector is (-a,-b). The direction of FG is from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is (-a, 0). So, angle between vector FG (-a, 0) and vector FD (-a, -b).

The angle between these vectors can be found using the dot product formula. Let me compute it.

Vector FG is (-a, 0). Vector FD is from F to D, which is (-a, -b). Wait, but for angle DFG, we're looking at the angle between FG and FD. Wait, FD is the same as DF but in reverse direction. So, the vectors are FG and FD.

Wait, angle DFG is at point F, between D-F-G. So, the two sides are FD and FG. So, vector FD is from F to D: (-a, -b), and vector FG is from F to G: (-a, 0). So, the angle between these two vectors.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (FD • FG) / (|FD| |FG|)

Compute FD • FG = (-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a² + 0 = a²

|FD| = sqrt(a² + b²)

|FG| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(a²) = a

Thus,

cos(theta) = a² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * a] ] = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, theta = arccos[ a / sqrt(a² + b²) ]

Which is equivalent to arctan(b/a). Wait, let me verify:

If we have cos(theta) = a / sqrt(a² + b²), then tan(theta) = sqrt( (sqrt(a² + b²))² - a² ) / a = sqrt(b²)/a = b/a. So theta = arctan(b/a). Wait, but this seems contradictory. Wait, because theta here is the angle between FG and FD, which is the same as angle between FG and DF. Wait, but earlier angle EDF was arctan(b/a). So angle DFG equals angle EDF?

Wait, that suggests that angle EDF equals angle DFG. But according to the problem, they are given as 5x -3 and 3x +7 respectively. If they are equal, then 5x -3 = 3x +7 → 2x = 10 → x=5. Then, substituting back, angle EDF would be 5*5 -3 = 22. Which is option A. But why are these angles equal?

Because in a rectangle, the two angles formed by the diagonal at each end are equal? Wait, because the triangle formed by the diagonal is similar? Wait, in this coordinate system, angle EDF and angle DFG are both arctan(b/a). Wait, but that would mean they are equal. So, this implies that angle EDF = angle DFG. Thus, setting them equal:

5x -3 = 3x +7 → 2x = 10 → x =5. Then, angle EDF is 5*5 -3 = 22. Which matches option A. But why are these angles equal?

Because when you draw a diagonal in a rectangle, the angles that the diagonal makes with the sides are equal? Wait, no. Wait, in reality, in a rectangle, the two angles formed by the diagonal at each corner are supplementary with respect to the other angles. Wait, but in our calculation above, angle EDF and angle DFG seem to be equal. Why?

Wait, because in the rectangle, the diagonal creates similar triangles. For example, triangle D-E-F and triangle F-G-D. Are they similar?

Wait, in our coordinate system, triangle D-E-F has legs DE = a, DF = sqrt(a² + b²), and EF = b. Triangle D-G-F has legs DG = b, DF = sqrt(a² + b²), and FG = a. These triangles are congruent? No, they are not congruent unless a = b. But they are similar? Yes, because their corresponding angles are equal. The angles at D and F are equal. Wait, but in our case, angle EDF and angle DFG are equal? Because of the symmetry?

Yes, because the rectangle has opposite sides equal and the diagonal forms congruent triangles. So, the angles that the diagonal makes with the sides are equal. Hence, angle EDF equals angle DFG. Therefore, setting their measures equal gives us the equation 5x -3 = 3x +7 → x=5, leading to angle EDF = 22°, which is option A.

But earlier when I thought the angles were at D, I got conflicting results. But upon realizing that angle DFG is at point F, not D, the problem becomes solvable with the equality of those angles. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 22 degrees.

Let me check once again. Given angle EDF = 5x -3 and angle DFG = 3x +7. Since they are equal, solving gives x=5, hence angle EDF = 5*5 -3 = 22. So answer A.

But why did the initial interpretation of angle DFG at D lead to inconsistency? Because of misreading the angle notation. The key was recognizing that angle DFG is at point F, not D. Once that correction is made, the rest follows logically.
