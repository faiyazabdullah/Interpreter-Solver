MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 2 here. The problem gives some geometric constraints involving angles A, B, C, D, 1, 2, and 3. But wait, the exact details aren't fully specified in the question. Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on standard geometric problems? Let me think.

First, the problem mentions Angle(A, B, C), which probably refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So that would be ∠ABC. Then there are measures for angles B, C, D, 1, 2, 3. Wait, but the way it's written is confusing. Let me parse the given information again:

The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A, B, C)
Angle(B)
Angle(C)
Angle(D)
Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C"

Wait, maybe there was a formatting issue. Let me re-express this as per possible structure.

Possibly, the constraints are that certain angles are equal. For example, maybe:

- Measure of Angle(A,B,C) equals Measure of Angle(B)?
Or perhaps each of those angles (like Angle(B), Angle(C), etc.) have their measures equal to others?

Alternatively, maybe there's a diagram with multiple triangles or lines where these angles are part of. Since the problem involves angles labeled 1, 2, 3, maybe they're parts of intersecting lines or transversals.

But without seeing the actual diagram, it's challenging. However, common scenarios involve triangle angle sums, supplementary angles, vertical angles, or parallel lines with transversals.

Let me consider that the problem might relate to a triangle with angles A, B, C, but then also includes angles D, 1, 2, 3. Alternatively, maybe there are two triangles connected, or a quadrilateral?

Another approach: since the answer choices are numerical values (like 49, 55, etc.), and the question asks for angle 2, which could be an external angle or something similar.

Wait, the original problem says:

"Find the measure of ∠2."

And the constraints include:

- Angle(A,B,C): which is ∠ABC.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)... Maybe that's supposed to mean that the measure of angle A equals the measure of angle B equals the measure of angle C? Or perhaps that ∠ABC equals ∠B, ∠C, etc.?

This is unclear. But maybe there's a standard configuration. Let me think of a typical problem where such constraints appear.

For instance, suppose we have a triangle ABC with angles at A, B, C. If ∠ABC (which is angle B) is equal to another angle, say angle D, which could be an exterior angle or something else. Also, angles 1, 2, 3 might refer to specific angles formed by intersections.

Alternatively, maybe it's about a triangle with an exterior angle. Remember that an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles.

Suppose angle 1, 2, 3 are parts of such a scenario. For example, if there's a triangle with an exterior angle, and angles 1 and 2 are the remote interior angles, making angle 3 the exterior angle. Then angle 3 would equal angle 1 + angle 2.

But how does angle 2 come into play here? Let me think of a possible setup.

Alternatively, if there are three angles mentioned: angles B, C, D. Suppose angle B and angle C are base angles of an isosceles triangle, so they are equal. Then angle D could be the vertex angle or something else. But again, without more info, hard to tell.

Wait, the initial constraints mention Angle(A,B,C), which is angle B. Then, Equates Measure of Angle(A), Measure of Angle(B), Measure of Angle(C). So perhaps that means that angles A, B, C are all equal? Wait, but angle A and angle C would be angles at different vertices. If it's a triangle, then angles A, B, C are the three angles. If they are all equal, then it's an equilateral triangle, each 60 degrees. But then where do angles D, 1, 2, 3 fit in?

Alternatively, maybe angle(A,B,C) is referring to angle at B, and then MeasureOf(Angle(A)) refers to angle at A, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at B, MeasureOf(Angle(C)) is angle at C. So the equality implies that angle A = angle B = angle C. Therefore, triangle ABC is equilateral, so each angle is 60 degrees. But then where do angles D, 1, 2, 3 come into play?

Perhaps angle D is related to another part of the figure. Maybe there's a transversal line creating angles 1, 2, 3 with other lines.

Alternatively, maybe there's a diagram where angle 2 is an exterior angle, and angles 1 and 3 are remote interior angles. For example, if angle 2 is an exterior angle, then angle 2 = angle 1 + angle 3. But if angles 1 and 3 are known, then angle 2 can be computed.

But how do the given constraints tie into this? Let's assume that angle A, B, C are angles of a triangle, each equal, so 60 degrees. Then angle D could be another angle in the figure, like a straight line, making supplementary angles.

Wait, but the problem mentions angles 1, 2, 3. Maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are angles inside a triangle, and angle 2 is an exterior angle. For example, in a triangle, if you extend one side, forming an exterior angle, which equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

If angle 1 and angle 3 are those two interior angles, then angle 2 (the exterior angle) would be 1 + 3. But without knowing the measures of angles 1 and 3, we can't compute angle 2 directly.

Wait, but the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B)), which equals MeasureOf(Angle(C)). So if angles A, B, C are all equal, then each is 60 degrees. But if angle 1 and angle 3 are parts of another triangle or something else... 

Alternatively, maybe angle D is an angle outside the triangle, and angles 1, 2, 3 are parts of some other relationships.

Alternatively, think of a case where there are two triangles sharing a common side. For example, if triangle ABC has angles A, B, C, and there's another triangle attached, leading to angles D, 1, 2, 3.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Since the answer choices are numbers around 50s, maybe angle 2 is derived from a triangle with angles adding up to 180. For example, if angle 2 is part of a triangle where other angles are known.

Wait, another thought: if angles A, B, C are equal, each being 60 degrees, then maybe angle D is supplementary to one of them, making angle D = 120 degrees. Then angles 1, 2, 3 could be angles created by intersecting lines, like vertical angles or something. For example, if two lines cross, forming vertical angles. But again, without specifics, hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is part of a linear pair with angle D. For example, if angle D is 120 degrees, then angle 2 could be its supplement, making 60 degrees. But none of the answer choices are 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, think of a pentagon or other polygon. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the key lies in the fact that angles A, B, C are equal. Let's say they are all x degrees. Then in a triangle, x + x + x = 180 => x=60. So angles A, B, C are 60 each. Now, if angle D is another angle in the figure, maybe adjacent to angle B, forming a straight line. So angle D would be 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. Then, if angles 1 and 2 are parts of another triangle or transversal...

Suppose there's a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, creating corresponding angles. For example, if angle D is 120 degrees, then corresponding angles could be equal. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle ABC with angles A=60, B=60, C=60. If there's a line extending from point B, creating an exterior angle, which would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Wait, the exterior angle at B would be equal to angle A + angle C = 60+60=120 degrees. So that's angle D, which is 120 degrees.

Now, if angles 1 and 2 are parts of that exterior angle. For example, if the exterior angle is split into two angles, 1 and 2, then angle 1 + angle 2 = 120. But without knowing either angle 1 or 2, we can't find the value. Unless there's more info.

Wait, but the problem mentions angle(1), angle(2), angle(3). Maybe angle 3 is another angle in the same context. For instance, if there's another transversal creating angles 1, 2, 3. Suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are both 60 degrees, then angle 2 would be 120 - 60 = 60, but again no matching answer.

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are angles from the triangle, like 60 each, then angle 2 would be 60. Still no match.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem statement again carefully.

Original problem:

GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A, B, C)
Angle(B)
Angle(C)
Angle(D)
Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)

So, breaking down:

It seems like the first line defines Angle(A, B, C), which is angle at B between A and C, i.e., ∠ABC.

Then, there are references to Angle(B), Angle(C), Angle(D), Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3).

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A) ... which likely means that Measure of Angle(A) equals Measure of Angle(B) equals Measure of Angle(C). So angles A, B, C are equal in measure.

Assuming that Angle(A) refers to angle at A, Angle(B) is angle at B, Angle(C) is angle at C. So in triangle ABC, all three angles are equal, implying it's an equilateral triangle, each angle 60°.

Now, what about angles D, 1, 2, 3? These could be angles formed by extending sides or other constructions.

Maybe there's a diagram where angle D is an exterior angle. For example, if we extend side BC beyond C to a point D, forming an exterior angle at C. In that case, the exterior angle at C would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which are angle A and angle B. Since they are both 60°, the exterior angle would be 120°, which could be angle D.

Then, angles 1, 2, 3 might be angles formed by other intersections. For instance, if there's a transversal crossing lines, creating alternate interior angles, or something similar.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles labeled 1, 2, 3, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of two lines. For example, if two lines intersect, creating vertical angles. But without knowing which ones, it's tricky.

Alternatively, think of a case where angle D is 120°, and angles 1, 2, 3 are angles within a triangle or another figure. Suppose angle D is part of a triangle where angles 1 and 2 are two angles, and angle 3 is the third. But again, without more info, not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is about a triangle with an exterior angle, and angles 1 and 3 are the two remote interior angles, while angle 2 is the exterior angle. If angle 1 and angle 3 are both 60°, then angle 2 would be 120°, but that's not among the answer choices. Or if one of them is 60 and the other is something else.

Alternatively, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is vertically opposite to angle D, making it 120°, but again not matching answers.

Wait, looking back at the answer choices: 49, 55, 57, 76. None are 60 or 120. So maybe my assumption about angles A, B, C being 60° is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Wait, maybe Angle(A, B, C) refers to angle at B, and MeasureOf(Angle(A)) is angle at A, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at B, MeasureOf(Angle(C)) is angle at C. And the constraint is that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C)). So, if angle at A = angle at B = angle at C, then in a triangle, each is 60°. But maybe the figure isn't a triangle? Like, maybe it's a different shape.

Wait, if it's not a triangle, but a quadrilateral, for example. But then the sum of angles would be different. But the problem mentions Angle(A, B, C), which suggests a triangle.

Alternatively, maybe the angles A, B, C are not the internal angles of a single triangle. Maybe they are angles in different parts of the diagram.

Wait, another possibility: the diagram could involve a star or complex figure with multiple triangles. For example, a pentagram, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's about a triangle with an angle bisector. Suppose angle B is being bisected, creating angles 1 and 2. If angle B is, say, 60°, then angles 1 and 2 would be 30° each. But again, not matching answer choices.

Alternatively, if angle B is split into angles 1 and 2, with angle 1 being x and angle 2 being y, and some other relations.

Wait, but how does angle D fit in? Maybe angle D is another angle in the diagram, like an exterior angle.

Alternatively, think of a triangle ABC with angle B being split into angles 1 and 2 by a cevian, and angle D being another part.

But without a clear diagram, it's really challenging. Given that, maybe I need to make assumptions based on common problems.

Let me try assuming that angles A, B, C are all equal, each 60°, as in an equilateral triangle. Then, suppose there's a line extending from point B, creating an exterior angle, which would be 120°, as before. This exterior angle could be angle D. Now, if there's another transversal creating angles 1, 2, 3, possibly involving parallel lines.

For example, if there are two parallel lines cut by a transversal, creating corresponding angles. If angle D is 120°, then corresponding angles would also be 120°, and alternate interior angles would be equal.

But again, without knowing which angles 1, 2, 3 correspond to, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the transversal. For instance, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is a corresponding angle, then it's 120°, but again not matching answer choices.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an alternate interior angle with angle D, then it would be 120°, still no match.

Hmm. Since the answer choices are around 50s, maybe the measure of angle 2 is 55°, option B. But why?

Wait, another idea: suppose the diagram involves a triangle with angles A, B, C, and then angles 1, 2, 3 are angles formed by drawing medians or altitudes, creating smaller triangles. For example, if angle B is divided into angles 1 and 2, and angle C into angles 2 and 3, or something like that.

But if angles A, B, C are equal, each 60°, and if angle B is split into two angles, say angle 1 and angle 2, then depending on how it's split, those angles could vary. But without more info, can't determine.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle with angles A, B, C, and another triangle attached, making a larger figure. For example, if angle D is an angle of another triangle, and angles 1, 2, 3 are angles in that triangle.

But this is too vague. Let me try a different approach. Let's suppose that the given conditions imply that angles A, B, C are all equal. So in a triangle, they are each 60°. Then, if there's a straight line passing through one of the vertices, creating supplementary angles. For example, at point B, if we draw a line extending from BC, forming a straight line, then the angle adjacent to angle B (which is 60°) would be 180° - 60° = 120°, which could be angle D.

Now, if there's a transversal intersecting two lines, creating angles 1, 2, 3. For example, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the transversal. If the transversal creates angles that are supplementary or equal to other angles.

Alternatively, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is a vertical angle to it, making it 120°, but again not matching.

Alternatively, if angle D is 120°, and angles 1 and 3 are angles in a triangle with angle 2. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle where angle 2 is the third angle. So angle 1 + angle 3 + angle 2 = 180. But without knowing angle 1 and 3, can't calculate.

Wait, perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are the angles from the triangle ABC. For example, if angle 1 is angle A (60°), angle 3 is angle C (60°), then angle 2 would be 180 - 60 - 60 = 60°. Still no match.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is angle D (120°), and angle 3 is angle A (60°), then angle 2 would be 180 - 120 - 60 = 0°, impossible.

Hmm. This is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider that the given constraints are not all about a single triangle. Perhaps there are multiple triangles involved, and the angles are interconnected.

Wait, going back to the beginning, the problem says "Angle(A, B, C)" which is angle at B, and "MeasureOf(Angle(A))", "MeasureOf(Angle(B))", "MeasureOf(Angle(C))" are equal. So, maybe angle at A equals angle at B equals angle at C, meaning it's an equilateral triangle. So each angle is 60°.

Now, if angle D is an angle outside the triangle, like an exterior angle, which is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So if we take angle at A and angle at C, which are both 60°, then the exterior angle at B would be 60 + 60 = 120°, which is angle D. So angle D = 120°.

Now, if angles 1, 2, 3 are angles formed by another transversal or something. For example, if there's a line intersecting two sides of the triangle, creating angles 1, 2, 3. Let's say a line intersects AB at point E and AC at point F, creating various angles.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Alternatively, if there's a parallelogram involved, where opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But again, not enough info.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is an angle formed by the intersection of two lines, and using the given angles to find it. For example, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is vertical to angle D, then it's 120°. Not matching.

Alternatively, if angle D is 120°, and angle 2 is supplementary to angle D, making it 60°, but still no match.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is part of a triangle where other angles are known. For example, if angle 2 is part of a triangle with angles 1 and 3, and we know angle 1 and angle 3 from elsewhere.

But how? If angle 1 and angle 3 are angles from the main triangle ABC, which are 60° each, then angle 2 would be 180 - 60 - 60 = 60°, again no match.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is 60°, angle 3 is 60°, and angle 2 is the exterior angle, which would be 120°, but again no match.

At this point, I'm stuck because the problem lacks sufficient information, but since it's a standardized test question, there must be a standard interpretation.

Let me think differently. What if the angles A, B, C are not the angles of a triangle, but rather angles in a different context. For example, in a quadrilateral, the sum of angles is 360°. If angles A, B, C are three of the four angles, and they are equal, then each would be 360/3 = 120°, but then angle D would be the fourth angle, which would be 360 - 3*120 = 0°, which is impossible.

No, that doesn't work. Another possibility: the diagram involves a pentagon, but that's even less likely.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a triangle with an altitude, median, or angle bisector. For example, if angle B is bisected into angles 1 and 2. If angle B is 60°, then angles 1 and 2 would be 30° each. But again, not matching the answer choices.

Alternatively, if angle B is 60°, and angle 2 is an external angle, then it would be 180 - 60 = 120°, but again no match.

Wait, maybe the problem involves a triangle where angles A, B, C are not all equal, but the measure of angle A equals measure of angle B equals measure of angle C. Wait, but that would imply they are all equal, hence equilateral.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a triangle, but a different figure. For example, a trapezoid with three angles equal. But trapezoid angles usually sum to 360°, so if three angles are equal, say x, then 3x + x = 360 → x=90°, making it a rectangle. But then angle D would be the fourth angle, which is also 90°, and angles 1, 2, 3 could be 90° each. No help.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that the given constraints are part of a system of equations. Let me try setting variables.

Let me denote:

Let’s assume that angles A, B, C are the angles of a triangle. So their measures add up to 180°. Given that Measure(A) = Measure(B) = Measure(C), then each is 60°, as before.

Now, let's say angle D is an exterior angle at vertex B, so it equals the sum of the remote interior angles, which are A and C, each 60°, so D = 60 + 60 = 120°.

Now, suppose angles 1, 2, 3 are angles formed by another line intersecting the triangle. For example, if a line extends from point C, creating an angle with side BC, forming angle 1, and another intersection creating angle 2, etc. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an angle in a smaller triangle formed by the extension. For example, if we extend BC to D, creating an exterior angle of 120°, and then draw a line from D to A, forming triangle ADC, where angle 2 is one of its angles.

In that case, let's say in triangle ADC, we have angle at D (which is 120°), angle at C, and angle at A. But angle at C in triangle ADC is the same as angle C in the original triangle, which is 60°. So angle at A in triangle ADC would be 180 - 120 - 60 = 0°, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an angle in another triangle. Maybe a triangle formed by the intersection of two lines. For example, if lines AD and BE intersect at a point, creating various angles.

But this is too speculative. Given that I'm running out of ideas, maybe the answer is 55°, option B, but I need to justify it somehow.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is about a triangle with angles A, B, C, where angles A and B are equal, and angle C is different. But the given condition says Measure(A) = Measure(B) = Measure(C), so they must all be equal. Hence, 60° each. Then, if there's a transversal creating angles 1, 2, 3, and angle 2 is one of them.

Wait, suppose there's a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, creating corresponding angles. If one of the angles is 60°, then the corresponding angle is also 60°, but again not matching.

Alternatively, if the transversal creates a 60° angle and a 120° angle, and angle 2 is one of them. But again, no match.

Wait, maybe the problem involves a triangle with angles 60°, 60°, 60°, and then angle D is 60°, and angles 1, 2, 3 are parts of another triangle. For example, if angle 1 and angle 2 are angles in a right triangle, and angle 3 is the right angle. But without knowing the exact relationship, it's guesswork.

Since I'm stuck, and the answer choices are 49, 55, 57, 76, maybe the correct answer is 55°, option B. But why?

Wait, another idea: if angle A, B, C are angles in a triangle, each 60°, and angle D is an angle outside, say 120°. If there's a triangle where angle D is one angle, and angles 1 and 3 are the other two, then angle 2 would be the third angle. For example, if angle D = 120°, and angle 1 = 60°, then angle 2 = 180 - 120 - 60 = 0°, invalid. If angle 1 = 30°, angle 3 = 30°, then angle 2 = 180 - 120 - 30 - 30 = 0°, still no.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is part of a different triangle. For example, if angle 2 is an angle in a triangle with angles 1 and 3, where angle 1 is 60°, and angle 3 is 60°, then angle 2 would be 60°. Still no match.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the most plausible scenario. Since the problem involves angles that add up to 180°, and the answer choices are around 50-76, perhaps angle 2 is part of a triangle where the other angles are 60° and 60°, making angle 2 = 60°, but since that's not an option, maybe there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the angles A, B, C are not all equal, but instead, MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B)), and MeasureOf(Angle(B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C)), but not necessarily all three. Wait, but the way it's written is:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C

This could mean that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B)), and MeasureOf(Angle(B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C)), hence all three are equal. So it's still the same as before.

Given that, I'll have to go with the most plausible answer, even though I can't derive it properly. If angle 2 is an exterior angle, which is 120°, but that's not an option. If it's half of that, 60°, not an option. Maybe there's a different configuration.

Wait, what if the diagram shows a triangle with angles A, B, C, and then a line dividing one of the angles into two parts, say angle B is split into angles 1 and 2. If angle B is 60°, then angles 1 and 2 could be 30° each. But again, not matching.

Alternatively, if angle B is 60°, and angle 2 is an external angle, making it 120°, but no.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is an angle in a different triangle, where the other angles are known. For example, if angle 1 is 60°, angle 3 is 60°, then angle 2 would be 60°, but again no.

Since I've spent so much time and can't find a logical path, I'll guess that the answer is B. 55°, as it's in the middle of the range. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe it's 57°, option C.

Wait, another idea: if the triangle has angles A, B, C, with angles A and B equal, and angle C is different. But the problem says all three are equal. Wait, maybe it's not a triangle. Maybe it's a different figure.

Wait, if it's a quadrilateral, and three of the angles are equal, say each 60°, then the fourth angle would be 360 - 3*60 = 180°, making it a straight line. Not useful.

Alternatively, if it's a pentagon, but that's too many angles.

Wait, maybe the diagram shows a triangle with an inscribed circle, and angles 1, 2, 3 are angles related to the circle. But I don't know.

At this point, I think I need to conclude that the correct answer is B. 55°, even though my reasoning is incomplete. Final Answer: B.
