A. 5.6
B. 18
C. 20

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that the measure of angle 5 is 7x minus 5, and the measure of angle 4 is 2x plus 23. We need to find x. Hmm, but wait, there's no diagram provided. That might mean I have to assume some standard geometric configuration based on typical problems involving angles labeled 4 and 5. 

In most cases, when angles are labeled like that, they're likely part of a transversal intersecting two lines, maybe parallel lines? Because then angles 4 and 5 could be consecutive interior angles, same-side interior angles, or maybe vertical angles. Wait, but without knowing their positions, it's tricky. Let me think. If they are same-side interior angles, then they would be supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180 degrees. Alternatively, if they are vertical angles, they'd be equal. But since the expressions for each are different, they probably aren't vertical angles. So maybe they are supplementary?

Alternatively, maybe they are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles, which would make them congruent. But again, since their expressions differ, that seems unlikely unless there's more context. Since the problem is presented without a diagram, perhaps it's expected to know that angles 4 and 5 are supplementary? Or maybe they form a linear pair?

Wait, another possibility: if angles 4 and 5 are adjacent forming a straight line, so they are supplementary. For example, if angle 4 and angle 5 are next to each other on a straight line, then their sum is 180 degrees. Let me check that assumption. Let me try assuming that they are supplementary. Then:

m∠4 + m∠5 = 180

So substituting the given expressions:

(2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180

Combine like terms:

2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180 → 9x + 18 = 180

Subtract 18 from both sides:

9x = 162

Divide by 9:

x = 18

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 18. So that's possible. But wait, why do we assume they are supplementary? Maybe there's another relationship. Let me check if there's another way.

Alternatively, suppose angles 4 and 5 are vertical angles. Then they should be equal. So set them equal:

2x + 23 = 7x - 5

Solving:

23 + 5 = 7x - 2x → 28 = 5x → x = 28/5 = 5.6, which is option A. But then, which assumption is correct?

But how can I know whether they are vertical or supplementary? Without a diagram, this is ambiguous. However, in many standard problems, especially when angles are labeled consecutively (like 4 and 5), they are often related through a transversal. If they are same-side interior angles, they are supplementary. If they are alternate interior or corresponding, they are congruent. But if the problem gives different expressions, then congruence isn't possible unless there's more info. 

Another thought: maybe angle 4 and angle 5 are complementary? But that would be less common. Or maybe they are part of a triangle? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem refers to a specific figure commonly used in textbooks. For instance, if angles 4 and 5 are on a straight line, making them supplementary. Or if they are part of a triangle with another angle. But without more information, it's hard to tell.

However, considering that the answer choices include both 5.6 and 18, which are results from the two assumptions I made, I need to determine which is more plausible. In typical textbook problems, if you have two angles that are formed by a transversal cutting two parallel lines, same-side interior angles are supplementary. If the question is about that scenario, then the answer would be 18. On the other hand, vertical angles would require equality. Given that the problem is presented without a diagram, but the answer choices include both possibilities, but maybe the problem assumes supplementary angles. Also, the fact that 18 is an integer, whereas 5.6 is a decimal, and sometimes problems prefer integer answers. But that's not necessarily a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are remote interior angles in a triangle? But that's getting too vague.

Wait, maybe there's another relationship. Suppose angles 4 and 5 are adjacent angles forming a larger angle. For example, if they are adjacent and together form a right angle or something else. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

But given that the problem is presented as a standard algebraic problem, and the answer choices are given, and that the most common relationships between angles in such contexts are either supplementary or congruent, I think the safest bet is to go with supplementary angles because that leads to x=18, which is one of the answer choices. Also, if the problem comes from a section discussing parallel lines and transversals, then same-side interior angles being supplementary makes sense. Therefore, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Thus, solving 2x+23 +7x-5=180 gives x=18. Which matches answer choice B. Hence, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given expressions for the measures of angles 4 and 5:

$$
m\angle 4 = 2x + 23,\quad m\angle 5 = 7x - 5
$$

Since the problem does not include a diagram, we infer the most likely geometric relationship based on standard configurations involving angles labeled sequentially (e.g., 4 and 5). These are typically **same-side interior angles** formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. In such a case, these angles are **supplementary**, meaning their measures add up to $180^\circ$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Set up the equation based on the supplementary property:

$$
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180
$$

Substitute the given expressions:

$$
(2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
$$

Simplify:

$$
2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180 \\
9x + 18 = 180
$$

Subtract 18 from both sides:

$$
9x = 162
$$

Divide by 9:

$$
x = 18
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The value of $x$ is $18$, which corresponds to **Answer Choice B**.

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

Final Answer: B
