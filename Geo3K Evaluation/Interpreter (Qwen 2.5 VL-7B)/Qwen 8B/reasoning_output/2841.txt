====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a triangle ABC, right? And there are several constraints given here. Let me parse through them one by one.

First, it says Triangle(A,B,C), Point(A), Point(B), Point(C). Then Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,C). So that defines the sides of the triangle. Then there's RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which means angle at point B is a right angle? Wait, no. Wait, Angle(A,B,C) would be the angle at point B, since the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle at B is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B. 

Then they mention Right(Triangle(A,B,C)). That seems redundant because if it's a right angle at B, then it's already a right triangle. Maybe just reinforcing that. 

Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B))... equals LengthOf(Line(B,C))? So AB equals BC. And also equals LengthOf(Line(A,C)). So AB = BC = AC? Wait, that can't be unless it's an equilateral triangle. But wait, if it's a right triangle, how can all sides be equal?

Wait, hold on. If triangle ABC has a right angle at B, and AB = BC, then it's an isosceles right-angled triangle. But in that case, the legs AB and BC are equal, and the hypotenuse AC would be AB√2. But according to the constraints, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals LengthOf(Line(B,C)) equals LengthOf(Line(A,C)). Wait, that would mean that AB = BC = AC. But in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is longer than either leg. So if AB and BC are legs, then AC (hypotenuse) should be longer than both. So if AB=BC=AC, that's impossible unless all sides are zero, which isn't possible. There's a contradiction here. 

Hmm, maybe I misread the constraints. Let me check again. The problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C))"

So that suggests that AB equals BC equals AC. So all three sides are equal. But in a right-angled triangle, that's not possible. Unless... Wait, unless the right angle is not between AB and BC. Wait, but the right angle is at B. So angle at B is the right angle. So AB and BC are the two legs. Then AC is the hypotenuse. So for AB=BC=AC, that would require that the hypotenuse equals the legs, which is impossible. Because in a right triangle, hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of legs. So if AB = BC = x, then AC^2 = x² + x² = 2x² → AC = x√2 ≈ 1.414x. Which is longer than x. So AC cannot equal AB or BC. Hence, there's a contradiction here. 

But the problem states these constraints. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is not saying that all three lengths are equal, but that each pair is equal? Like AB equals BC, and BC equals AC? Or maybe the way it's written is that AB equals BC equals AC. But that would imply all three are equal. 

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in interpreting the constraints? Let me re-examine the original problem statement.

The exact wording is:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C))"

This structure might indicate that each length is equal to the next. So first, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals LengthOf(Line(B,C)), and then LengthOf(Line(B,C)) equals LengthOf(Line(A,C)). Therefore, AB = BC and BC = AC. So AB = BC = AC. Which brings us back to the same problem. 

But this seems contradictory. How can a right-angled triangle have all sides equal? It's impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not stating that all three sides are equal, but rather that AB equals BC, and BC equals AC? No, that would still make AB = BC = AC. Alternatively, maybe the problem was mistyped. For example, maybe it's supposed to say that AB equals BC, and AC equals something else. But based on the given text, it's unclear. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, there must be some interpretation where this works.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not a right triangle? But the problem says Right(Triangle(A,B,C)), so it's definitely a right triangle. Also, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) specifies that the angle at B is the right angle. So that's fixed.

Wait, maybe the problem is using non-Euclidean geometry? Probably not; the question is likely expecting standard Euclidean geometry. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a degenerate triangle? But even then, a degenerate triangle would have area zero, but the side lengths would have to satisfy certain conditions. However, in that case, if AB = BC = AC, then it's an equilateral triangle, which can't be right-angled. So that's not possible. 

Hmm. This seems like a paradox. But since the problem exists, I must be missing something. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's suppose that the triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs AB and BC equal, making it an isosceles right triangle. Then AC is the hypotenuse. In that case, the cosine of angle at A or angle at C would be adjacent over hypotenuse. Wait, the question asks for the cosine of angle A. Wait, angle A is at point A. Wait, but in the problem, the angle mentioned is Angle(A,B,C), which is angle at B. Wait, the problem says "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C))". So that's the cosine of the right angle. Which is cos(90°) = 0. But that's not matching any answer choices. But the answer choices are 0.60, 0.75, etc. So that suggests that maybe the problem is asking for a different angle. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the question says: "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C)) RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C)) CosineOf(A)". Wait, maybe the problem is mistyped? Let me read again.

Original question: "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C) RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C) CosineOf(A)" ?

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in formatting. Let me try to parse the question again.

The question is: Express the ratio of cos A as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. Where A is angle at A? Or is it angle at B?

Wait, the problem says: "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C) RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C) CosineOf(A)" 

Possibly, the actual question is: Compute the cosine of angle A, given that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B, and AB = BC = AC. But as discussed earlier, this is impossible. However, perhaps the problem meant that AB = BC, and AC is the hypotenuse, so AB = BC, making it an isosceles right triangle. In that case, angle at A and angle at C are both 45 degrees. Then, cos(angle A) would be cos(45°) which is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, which rounds to 0.71. But none of the answer choices include 0.71. Closest is option B (0.75) or C (0.80). Hmm.

But why would the problem mention that AB equals BC equals AC? If it's an isosceles right triangle, only AB = BC, not AC. So maybe the problem had a typo, and instead of equals, it's another condition. For example, maybe the triangle is such that AB equals BC, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then, cos(angle A) would be adjacent over hypotenuse. Let's work through that scenario.

Assume triangle ABC is right-angled at B, with AB = BC. So AB and BC are the legs, each of length x. Then AC, the hypotenuse, is x√2. Now, angle A is at vertex A. In triangle ABC, angle at A is opposite to BC. So in terms of trigonometry, cos(angle A) is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent side to angle A is AB, which is x. Hypotenuse is AC, which is x√2. So cos(A) = AB / AC = x / (x√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071, which is approximately 0.71. But again, the answer choices don't have that. However, if the problem intended AB = BC, and AC is the hypotenuse, then the answer would be about 0.71, which is closest to option B (0.75) or C (0.80)? Well, 0.7071 is closer to 0.71, which would round to 0.71, but since the choices are 0.60, 0.75, 0.80, 1.33, none of which are 0.71. But maybe the problem intended something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is not right-angled at B? Wait, the constraint says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle at B. So it's definitely right-angled at B. So then angle A is one of the acute angles. So cos(angle A) is adjacent/hypotenuse, which is AB/AC. Since AB = BC, and AC = sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt(2 AB²) = AB * sqrt(2). Thus, cos(A) = AB / (AB*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2) ≈ 0.7071. Still, same result. 

But since the answer choices don't include 0.71, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. Suppose that instead of AB = BC, maybe AB = AC? Wait, but the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)) Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)) Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C))). So AB = BC = AC. Which would make it equilateral, but in a right-angled triangle. Impossible. So this suggests that the problem may have conflicting constraints. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of BC / AC? Because in the question, the last part mentions "RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C) CosineOf(A)". Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of BC/AC multiplied by cosine of angle A? Or maybe the cosine of angle A is equal to that ratio? Let me try to parse the original question again.

Original question: "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C) RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C) CosineOf(A)" 

It's possibly a formatting issue. Perhaps the problem is asking for the value of cosine of angle A, given that in the triangle, the ratio of BC to AC is equal to the cosine of angle A. Or maybe the cosine of angle A is equal to the ratio of BC to AC. Let me assume that. 

If angle A is at point A, then in triangle ABC, angle A is opposite to BC. So using the definition of cosine in a right-angled triangle. Wait, but if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle A is adjacent to AB and AC. Wait, perhaps using the cosine formula for angle A.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, so angle A is adjacent to AB and AC. Wait, no. Let me draw the triangle mentally. Points A, B, C. Right angle at B. So AB and BC are perpendicular. So AB is vertical, BC horizontal, and AC is hypotenuse. Then angle at A is between AB and AC. So the adjacent side to angle A is AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. So cos(angle A) = AB / AC. As before. 

If AB = BC, then AB = BC = x, AC = x√2. So cos(angle A) = x / (x√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071. But again, the answer choices do not have this. However, if the problem had said that AB = AC, then it would be different. Let's explore that possibility.

Suppose AB = AC. Then, since it's a right-angled triangle at B, then AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So if AB = AC, then AB = AC. But AC is the hypotenuse, which should be longer than AB. Contradiction. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, if the triangle is right-angled at A, but the problem says the right angle is at B. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the problem is not a right triangle? But the given constraints state Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), so it must be a right triangle. 

This is confusing. Given that, perhaps the problem contains a mistake, but assuming that the intention was for the triangle to be a right-angled isosceles triangle (with legs AB and BC equal), leading to cos(angle A) being 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071, which is approximately 0.71. The closest answer choice would be B (0.75) or C (0.80). But 0.71 is closer to 0.71 than to 0.75 or 0.80. However, since the options don't include 0.71, maybe the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, and the actual calculation was different.

Wait, let me think again. What if the triangle is not right-angled at B, but at A? Wait, no, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle at B. So it's right-angled at B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the cosine of angle B, which is the right angle, hence cos(90°)=0. But that's not an option. 

Wait, the question says "Express the ratio of cos A as a decimal..." So cos(angle A). If angle A is 45 degrees, then cos(45°)=~0.7071, which is approximately 0.71. But since this is not among the choices, maybe the problem intended a different configuration.

Wait, what if the triangle is right-angled at B, with AB ≠ BC, but AB = AC? Wait, that's not possible. AC is hypotenuse, so longer than AB. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the Law of Cosines instead of the basic right triangle definitions. Let's try that. 

Law of Cosines says c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). But in our case, since it's a right triangle at B, we know that AC² = AB² + BC². If we want to find cos(angle A), which in the right triangle can also be expressed as adjacent/hypotenuse. But maybe the problem wants us to use Law of Cosines. Let's see. 

Let’s denote AB = c, BC = a, AC = b. Wait, usually in triangles, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. But regardless, let's assign variables properly. 

Since the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle B is 90°, and sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Let’s call AB = x, BC = y, AC = z. Then, by Pythagoras: x² + y² = z². 

Now, angle A is one of the acute angles. To find cos(angle A), which is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent side to angle A is AB, which is x. Hypotenuse is z. So cos(A) = x/z. 

Now, the problem states that AB = BC = AC. Wait, but that would mean x = y = z. Substituting into Pythagoras: x² + x² = x² => 2x² = x² => x = 0, which is impossible. So this is invalid. 

Therefore, the initial assumption that AB = BC = AC is invalid. Hence, there must be a misinterpretation of the constraints. 

Perhaps the problem meant that AB = BC, and AC is something else. Let's assume that. So AB = BC = x, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then, AC = x√2. Then, cos(A) = AB / AC = x / (x√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071, which is approximately 0.71. Again, not matching the options. 

But looking at the answer choices, option B is 0.75, which is 3/4. Option C is 0.80. Maybe the problem assumes that AB = AC? Wait, if AB = AC, but then AC is the hypotenuse. So AB = AC implies that AB is the hypotenuse, which contradicts the fact that in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So AB can't be equal to AC if AC is the hypotenuse. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not right-angled at B? Let me check the original constraints again. The problem says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle at B, so yes, right angle at B. 

Alternatively, could the problem have a typo in the equality of lengths? For instance, maybe it's supposed to say that AB equals AC? Or BC equals AC? Let's consider if BC equals AC. 

If BC = AC, then in the right triangle at B, BC is one of the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So BC = AC implies that the leg equals the hypotenuse, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if AB equals AC, then AB is a leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. So AB = AC implies that leg equals hypotenuse, which is also impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that AB = AC, and the right angle is at C? Let's try that. Suppose the right angle is at C. Then, AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. If AB = AC, then AB = AC, so the hypotenuse equals one of the legs, which is impossible. 

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to look at the answer choices and work backward. Let's assume that the correct answer is B (0.75). If cos(A) = 0.75, then angle A is arccos(0.75) ≈ 41.41 degrees. In a right-angled triangle, if angle A is 41.41 degrees, then angle C would be 48.59 degrees. Then, the sides would satisfy tan(A) = BC/AB. Let me compute. 

Let’s say AB = 1 (adjacent to angle A), then BC = tan(A) = tan(41.41) ≈ 0.888. Then AC = sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt(1 + 0.79) ≈ sqrt(1.79) ≈ 1.338. So the ratio BC/AC ≈ 0.888 / 1.338 ≈ 0.663. Not sure how this helps. 

Alternatively, if the cosine of angle A is 0.75, then AB/AC = 0.75 → AB = 0.75 AC. Let’s say AC = 4 units, then AB = 3 units. Then BC = sqrt(AC² - AB²) = sqrt(16 - 9) = sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645. Then BC/AC = sqrt(7)/4 ≈ 0.6614. 

Not sure how this connects to the original problem's constraints. 

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio BC/AC. If the problem's question is actually asking for the ratio BC/AC, which is equal to cos(A), then in the right-angled triangle at B, cos(A) = AB/AC. Wait, no, BC is opposite to angle A, so sin(A) = BC/AC. Cos(A) = AB/AC. So if the problem mistakenly refers to BC/AC as cos(A), then it would be sin(A). 

But if the problem says "CosineOf(Angle(A,B,C)) RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C) LengthOf(Line(A,C) CosineOf(A)", maybe it's trying to say that cos(angle B) is equal to BC/AC, but angle B is 90 degrees, so cos(90) = 0, which would mean BC/AC = 0, implying BC = 0, which is impossible. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the contradictions in the problem constraints, but needing to pick an answer, perhaps the intended scenario is an isosceles right triangle, giving cos(A) ≈ 0.707, which is closest to 0.71, and since 0.71 is not an option, maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest hundredth, and due to possible miscalculations, the expected answer is 0.75 or 0.80. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 0.75, which is 3/4. If we consider that the problem might have mixed up sine and cosine, for example, if it asked for sine of angle A in an isosceles right triangle, then sin(A) = BC/AC = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707, which is close to 0.71. But if they mistakenly took the reciprocal, like BC/AB, which would be 1, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle, which is a common right triangle. Let's say AB = 3, BC = 4, AC = 5. Then cos(angle A) = AB/AC = 3/5 = 0.6, which is option A. But in this case, the triangle is not isosceles. But the problem says AB = BC = AC, which conflicts. 

Wait, but if the problem had said AB = BC, but didn't say AC equals anything, then it's an isosceles right triangle with AB = BC. So cos(A) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707. If forced to choose from the given options, the closest is B (0.75) or C (0.80). Since 0.707 is closer to 0.71 than to 0.75 or 0.80, but since 0.707 is approximately 0.71, which rounds to 0.71, but none of the options are 0.71. However, if there was a calculation mistake, perhaps assuming AB = AC, leading to a different result. 

Wait, let's try AB = AC. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, AC is the hypotenuse, so AB can't equal AC. But let's pretend it's possible. Then, if AB = AC = x, then by Pythagorean theorem: AB² + BC² = AC² → x² + BC² = x² → BC = 0, which is impossible. 

Another thought: maybe the problem is not a right triangle, but the constraints are conflicting? For example, if it's a right triangle with AB = BC, and also AB = AC. Then, AB = BC = AC, which is impossible. 

Given that, and needing to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is B (0.75). For example, if the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle, but with AB = 3, BC = 4, AC = 5. Then, cos(angle A) = 3/5 = 0.6, which is option A. But if AB = 4, BC = 3, then cos(angle A) = 4/5 = 0.8, which is option C. 

Wait, if the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle, then depending on which angle you're taking. Let's clarify:

In a 3-4-5 triangle, right-angled at B. Let's say AB = 3, BC = 4, AC = 5. Then, angle A is opposite to BC (which is 4). So cos(angle A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = AB/AC = 3/5 = 0.6. So option A. 

Alternatively, if AB = 4, BC = 3, then cos(angle A) = 4/5 = 0.8, option C. 

But the problem states that AB = BC = AC, which is not possible. But if we ignore that and assume that the problem meant AB = BC, then it's an isosceles right triangle with cos(A) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707. If the problem had a typo and meant AB = BC, and the answer choices expect 0.71 rounded to two decimals, but since that's not available, maybe the problem intended a different setup. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the cosine of angle B, which is 90 degrees, so 0, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors or coordinates. Let's try assigning coordinates. Let's place point B at (0,0), since it's the right angle. Let AB be along the y-axis, and BC along the x-axis. So point B is (0,0), point A is (0, y), point C is (x, 0). Then, AB has length y, BC has length x, AC has length sqrt(x² + y²). 

If AB = BC, then y = x. So AC = x√2. Then, cos(angle A) is adjacent over hypotenuse. At angle A, adjacent side is AB, which is y, and hypotenuse is AC = x√2. Since y = x, cos(angle A) = x / (x√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071. 

Again, same result. So if the answer choices are approximate, and the problem expects rounding, maybe the intended answer is 0.71, which is closest to option B (0.75) or C (0.80). But without knowing the exact context, it's hard to say. However, since 0.7071 is approximately 0.71, and if the options are limited, maybe the closest is B. But sometimes, when approximating, people might round 0.707 to 0.71, but if the options are given as 0.60, 0.75, 0.80, 1.33, then 0.71 is closer to 0.75 than to 0.60? Wait, no. 0.71 is 0.01 away from 0.70, but the options are 0.60, 0.75, 0.80. So 0.71 is 0.04 less than 0.75 and 0.09 more than 0.75? Wait, no. Wait, 0.71 is between 0.70 and 0.75. The options are A: 0.60, B: 0.75, C: 0.80. So 0.71 is closer to 0.75 than to 0.60, but not by much. 

However, if the problem had a different setup, like a 3-4-5 triangle with AB = 3, BC = 4, then cos(A) = 3/5 = 0.6 (option A). Or if AB = 4, BC = 3, then cos(A) = 4/5 = 0.8 (option C). 

Given that, and considering that the problem might have a typo in the constraints, perhaps the intended answer is C (0.80). But how? Let's think: if the triangle is right-angled at B, with AB = 4, BC = 3, then AC = 5. Then cos(A) = AB/AC = 4/5 = 0.8, which is option C. 

But why would AB = 4 and BC = 3? Because the problem stated that AB = BC = AC, which is not true. But if we ignore that and assume that AB = BC, then it's isosceles right triangle. But if the problem meant AB = AC, which is impossible, but let's say it did, then AB = AC, and it's right-angled at B. Let's try that. If AB = AC, and it's right-angled at B, then AB and BC are legs, AC is hypotenuse. So AB = AC. But AB is a leg, AC is hypotenuse, so AB = AC implies that the leg equals the hypotenuse, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if the triangle is right-angled at C, and AB = AC. Let's say right-angled at C, so AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse. If AB = AC, then AC = AB, so AC is both a leg and the hypotenuse, which is impossible. 

This is very confusing. Given the ambiguity, but needing to choose an answer, I'll go with the most plausible scenario where the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, giving cos(A) ≈ 0.707, which is closest to 0.71. Since the options don't include 0.71, but option B is 0.75, which is the closest available higher value, and option C is 0.80. Depending on rounding conventions, sometimes values are rounded up. For example, 0.7071 rounds to 0.71, but if the options are limited, and the problem expects a specific answer, perhaps the intended answer is B (0.75). 

Alternatively, if the problem had a different setup where AB = BC, but AC is something else, and the cosine is calculated differently. For example, if the triangle is right-angled at B, and AB = BC, then angle at A is 45 degrees, so cos(45°) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. If the problem expects the student to rationalize or approximate, and if due to calculation errors, the answer is taken as 0.75, then B would be chosen. 

But without further information, it's challenging. Given the lack of better alternatives, I'll proceed with the isosceles right triangle scenario, giving approximately 0.71, and since the closest option is B (0.75), I'll choose B. 

Final Answer: B

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\cos(\angle A)$ in the described geometric setup, let's carefully interpret the constraints and apply known geometric principles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are given:

- Triangle $ABC$,
- Right angle at $B$: $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$,
- All sides are equal:  
  $$
  \text{Length}(AB) = \text{Length}(BC) = \text{Length}(AC).
  $$

This is a critical observation. While it appears that all sides are equal, this leads to a geometric impossibility in a **right triangle**. In a right triangle, the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is always longer than either of the two legs.

Thus, having all three sides equal violates the fundamental property of a right triangle. This contradiction indicates that the triangle **cannot exist** under the given constraints — a key insight that must guide our analysis.

---

### **Step 2: Re-evaluate the Assumptions**

Despite the contradiction, the problem **must** have a solution since it provides answer choices. This suggests that the intended meaning was not that **all sides are equal**, but that **two sides are equal**: specifically, $AB = BC$, while $AC$ remains the hypotenuse.

This makes sense for a **right isosceles triangle** (a right triangle with two equal legs).

---

### **Step 3: Use Geometry of Isosceles Right Triangle**

In such a triangle:
- Legs: $AB = BC = x$,
- Hypotenuse: $AC = x\sqrt{2}$,
- Right angle at $B$,
- Angles at $A$ and $C$ are $45^\circ$.

We are asked to compute:

$$
\cos(\angle A)
$$

From trigonometry in a right triangle:

$$
\cos(\angle A) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{x}{x\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.7071
