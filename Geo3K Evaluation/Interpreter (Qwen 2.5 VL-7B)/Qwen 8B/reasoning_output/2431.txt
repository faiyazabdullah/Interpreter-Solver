MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the length of the diagonal WY in a regular hexagon where each side is 12 cm. Let me start by recalling some properties of regular hexagons.

First, a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular hexagon is 120 degrees. Also, the diagonals in a regular hexagon can vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip. 

Wait, let me think. In a regular hexagon, there are different types of diagonals. The shortest diagonal connects two vertices with one vertex in between, like skipping one vertex. Then there's the longer diagonal that skips two vertices, which might be twice the length of the side? Or maybe something else?

Alternatively, maybe it's helpful to consider coordinates. If I place the hexagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin, then each vertex can be represented using polar coordinates converted to cartesian. Since a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles.

Let me try that approach. Suppose the side length is 's', here s = 12 cm. Let me imagine placing point U at (s, 0). Then each subsequent vertex is spaced at 60-degree angles around the center. Wait, but maybe it's easier to use vectors or complex numbers?

Alternatively, since regular hexagons can be split into equilateral triangles, the distance from the center to any vertex (the radius) is equal to the side length. So if the side length is 12 cm, the radius is also 12 cm. But wait, no, actually in a regular hexagon, the radius (distance from center to vertex) is equal to the side length. So each vertex is 12 cm away from the center.

But then, for example, points U, V, W, etc., are placed every 60 degrees around the center. Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let me label them as follows:

Let’s assume the hexagon is centered at the origin. Let me define the coordinates of each vertex. Starting with point U at (r, 0), where r is the radius. Since the side length is 12 cm, r equals 12 cm. So:

- Point U: (12, 0)
- Point V: (12*cos(60°), 12*sin(60°))
- Point W: (-6, 12*√3/2) ? Wait, maybe better to calculate each coordinate properly.

Wait, cos(60°) is 0.5 and sin(60°) is (√3)/2. So:

Point U: (12, 0)
Point V: (12 * cos(60°), 12 * sin(60°)) → (6, 6√3)
Point W: (12 * cos(120°), 12 * sin(120°)). Cos(120°) is cos(180°−60°)= -cos(60°)= -0.5. Sin(120°)= sin(60°)= √3/2. So W: (-6, 6√3)
Point X: (12 * cos(180°), 12 * sin(180°)) → (-12, 0)
Point Y: (12 * cos(240°), 12 * sin(240°)). Cos(240°)= cos(180°+60°)= -cos(60°)= -0.5. Sin(240°)= -sin(60°)= -√3/2. So Y: (-6, -6√3)
Point Z: (12 * cos(300°), 12 * sin(300°)). Cos(300°)= cos(-60°)= 0.5. Sin(300°)= -sin(60°)= -√3/2. So Z: (6, -6√3)

So coordinates:

U: (12, 0)
V: (6, 6√3)
W: (-6, 6√3)
X: (-12, 0)
Y: (-6, -6√3)
Z: (6, -6√3)

Now, we need to find the length of diagonal WY. Points W and Y are:

Point W: (-6, 6√3)
Point Y: (-6, -6√3)

So the distance between W and Y would be the distance between (-6, 6√3) and (-6, -6√3).

Since their x-coordinates are the same, the distance is just the difference in y-coordinates.

Difference in y-coordinates: 6√3 - (-6√3) = 12√3.

Therefore, the length of WY is 12√3 cm.

Looking at the answer choices:

A. 12
B. 6√6 ≈ 14.69...
C. 12√3 ≈ 20.78...
D. 36

So according to my calculation, the answer should be C. 12√3. Therefore, option C.

Wait, but let me verify again. Maybe I made a mistake in coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps another way to think about it. In a regular hexagon, the length of the longest diagonal is twice the side length. Wait, but the longest diagonal would be from one vertex opposite to the other. For example, from U to X, which is directly opposite. That distance would be 2*radius = 2*s. Since radius is equal to the side length. So that would be 24 cm. However, WY is not that diagonal. Let me check.

Point W is at (-6, 6√3), and Y is at (-6, -6√3). So that vertical line. The distance between them is indeed 12√3, which is approximately 20.78. Which is less than 24. So that seems correct.

Another way: In a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many edges they skip. For example, adjacent vertices are connected by sides. Diagonals that skip one vertex (like connecting U to W) have length 2*s*sin(60°). Wait, maybe another formula.

Alternatively, considering triangle formed by center and two vertices. For instance, the distance between two non-adjacent vertices. Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices apart they are. 

For example:

Adjacent vertices: distance is s (side length).

Two vertices apart (like U to W): this is a longer diagonal. How much is that?

If you consider the central angles between those points. From U to W, moving two steps (since U to V to W). So the central angle between U and W is 2*60°=120°. So the distance between U and W can be found using the law of cosines: d² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(theta), where theta is the central angle.

Here, theta is 120°, so:

d² = 12² + 12² - 2*(12)*(12)*cos(120°)

cos(120°) is equal to cos(180°−60°)= -cos(60°)= -0.5

Thus,

d² = 144 + 144 - 2*144*(-0.5) = 288 + 144 = 432

Then d = sqrt(432) = sqrt(16*27) = 4*3*sqrt(3) = 12√3 cm. Wait, that's the same result as before! So the distance between U and W is 12√3 cm. But in our case, the diagonal WY: let me see, in terms of steps between points.

Point W is connected to Y. Let's count how many steps apart they are. Let's list the order of the hexagon: U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So starting from W, going clockwise: W, X, Y, Z, U, V. So from W to Y is three steps away? Wait, from W to X is one, X to Y is two, Y is third. So W to Y is two steps apart? Wait, but in terms of positions:

The vertices are ordered U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So W is the third vertex. Y is the fifth vertex. So from W to Y: moving clockwise, it's two steps (W→X→Y). Alternatively, counter-clockwise, it's three steps (W→Z→Y? No, W to Z is one step counter-clockwise (from W to Z is backtracking?), maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in terms of positions, if we number them as 0 to 5:

Let me index them as 0: U, 1: V, 2: W, 3: X, 4: Y, 5: Z.

So W is index 2, Y is index 4. The difference is 2 steps ahead (index 2 to 4). So that's two steps apart. So the central angle between W and Y is 2*60° = 120°, same as earlier. Hence, the distance between W and Y is same as between U and W, which is 12√3 cm. So yes, that matches the previous calculation.

Hence, the answer is C. 12√3 cm.

But let me check once more. Another approach: in a regular hexagon, the length of the diagonal that spans across two vertices (i.e., skips one vertex) is √3 times the side length. Wait, no. Wait, when you connect two vertices with two edges between them, like U to W, that's a longer diagonal. Earlier calculation shows that it's 12√3 when the side is 12. So that would mean that the diagonal is √3 times the side length. Wait, 12√3 is √3 times 12. Yes. So that's consistent. Hence, the answer is C.

So among the answer choices, C is 12√3. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of diagonal $ WY $ in a **regular hexagon** with side length $ s = 12 $ cm, we begin by understanding the geometric structure of a regular hexagon. A key property of a regular hexagon is that it can be inscribed in a circle, meaning all its vertices lie on a common circle. Additionally, the side length $ s $ is equal to the radius of this circumscribed circle.

---

### Step 1: Coordinates of Hexagon Vertices

We position the hexagon such that its center lies at the origin and one vertex ($ U $) lies along the positive x-axis. Using trigonometry, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined as:

$$
\text{Vertex } U: (12, 0)
$$
$$
\text{Vertex } V: (6, 6\sqrt{3})
$$
$$
\text{Vertex } W: (-6, 6\sqrt{3})
$$
$$
\text{Vertex } X: (-12, 0)
$$
$$
\text{Vertex } Y: (-6, -6\sqrt{3})
$$
$$
\text{Vertex } Z: (6, -6\sqrt{3})
$$

These coordinates are derived from rotating the point $ (s, 0) $ by multiples of $ 60^\circ $ around the origin.

---

### Step 2: Compute Distance Between $ W $ and $ Y $

Using the coordinates of $ W = (-6, 6\sqrt{3}) $ and $ Y = (-6, -6\sqrt{3}) $, note that both points share the same x-coordinate. Thus, the distance between them is purely vertical:

$$
|y_2 - y_1| = |-6\sqrt{3} - 6\sqrt{3}| = | -12\sqrt{3} | = 12\sqrt{3}
$$

This confirms that the length of diagonal $ WY $ is $ 12\sqrt{3} $ cm.

---

### Step 3: Confirming via Geometry

An alternative method involves recognizing that in a regular hexagon, the length of a diagonal spanning two edges (i.e., connecting vertices with one vertex in between) corresponds to the chord subtending a central angle of $ 120^\circ $. Using the Law of Cosines in the triangle formed by the center and two such vertices:

$$
d^2 = r^2 + r^2 - 2r^2\cos(120^\circ) = 2r^2(1 - \cos(120^\circ))
$$

Since $ \cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2} $, we get:

$$
d^2 = 2r^2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 3r^2 \Rightarrow d = r\sqrt{3}
$$

With $ r = s = 12 $, we conclude:

$$
WY = 12\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
