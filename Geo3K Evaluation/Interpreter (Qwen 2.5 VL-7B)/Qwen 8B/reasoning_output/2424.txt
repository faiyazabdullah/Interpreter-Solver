MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided.

We have a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD. That means points A, B, C, D lie on a circle. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Also, there are right angles mentioned at Angle(AB,C) and Angle(C,D,B). Wait, angle ABC and angle CDB? Or maybe angle at point B for ABC and angle at point B for CDB? Wait, the notation might be important here. 

The first line says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which would mean that angle at point B between points A, B, C is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)) – so angle at point B between points C, B, D? Wait, but that would be angle CBD? So both angles at point B are right angles? But if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then having two right angles at point B seems conflicting unless it's a specific case.

Wait, but hold on. If ABCD is cyclic, then opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. However, if angles at B are both right angles (90 degrees), then the total sum around point B would be... Well, actually, each angle at B is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, no, in a quadrilateral, each vertex has one angle. So if angle ABC is a right angle, and angle ADC is something else. But here, the second condition is about angle CDB. Wait, angle CDB is angle at point D? Because Angle(C,D,B) would be angle at D between points C, D, B. Wait, no. The notation Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So Angle(A,B,C) is angle at B between A-B-C. Similarly, Angle(C,D,B) is angle at D between C-D-B. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(C,D,B): the middle letter is D, so it's angle at D between points C, D, B. So that's angle CDB. So angle at D, between C and B.

So we have two right angles: angle ABC (at B) and angle CDB (at D). Since ABCD is cyclic, perhaps we can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

But also, there are more elements mentioned. Then there's mentions of lines AB, BC, CD, DA as before. Then there are angles involving points G, E. Wait, the problem mentions:

RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E)) and RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E)). IsAngleOf(Line(A,B)) for Angle(G,B,E) and IsAngleOf(Line(C,D)) for Angle(G,B,E)? Wait, the text is a bit confusing. Let me check again.

Looking back:

The user wrote:

RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E))
RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E))
IsAngleOf(Line(A,B))
IsAngleOf(Line(C,D))
IsAngleOf(Line(G,E))
Angle(G,B,E)
IsAngleOf(Line(H,E))
Angle(H,B,E)

Hmm, perhaps these are indicating that angle GB-E is formed by lines related to AB and CE? Wait, the exact wording is unclear. Maybe the angles at point B involving points G and H?

Alternatively, maybe there are points G and H defined such that Line(G,E) and Line(H,E) are involved. Wait, but the original problem mentions Points A, B, C, D, but then introduces points G, E, H? Wait, the initial problem only lists Points A, B, C, D. Are G and E new points introduced in the constraints? Or is there a typo?

Wait, looking at the problem statement again:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:

Wait, this is getting messy. There might be some typos in the input. For example, "RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)" instead of "RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)". Maybe the original intended was RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B))? Assuming that, then proceeding.

Also, the last parts mention angles involving G and H. Perhaps points G and H are constructed based on lines AB and CD? Or maybe they're intersections? For instance, since there are right angles at GBE and HBE, perhaps G and H are points on certain lines?

But without clear definitions of points G and E, H, this is challenging. Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Let me try to reconstruct.

Assuming that the problem involves a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD with right angles at ABC and CDB. Then, considering angles involving points G and H, which may be intersections of lines. For example, if lines AB and CD intersect at some point, say G, but since ABCD is cyclic, AB and CD might not necessarily intersect unless extended.

Alternatively, maybe G and H are points such that lines GE and HE form right angles at B. Wait, the problem states RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E)) and RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E)). So angle at B between G-B-E is a right angle, and similarly for H-B-E. Therefore, both angles at B involving lines BG and BE, BH and BE. So points G and H are such that BG and BH are perpendicular to BE. Wait, but how does that fit into the diagram?

Alternatively, maybe E is another point, and lines GE and HE are connected to B. This is quite vague. Given the ambiguity, perhaps there's a standard configuration here.

Let me try to think differently. Since ABCD is cyclic with right angles at ABC and CDB. Let me sketch this mentally.

In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. However, if angle ABC is 90°, then angle ADC should be 90° as well because in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum to 180°. Wait, but angle ADC is at D. Wait, but angle CDB is mentioned, which is angle at D between C, D, B. So angle CDB is part of triangle CDB. If ABCD is cyclic, then angle ABC + angle ADC = 180°. Since angle ABC is 90°, angle ADC is 90°, making ABCD a rectangle? But that would require all angles to be 90°, but angle CDB being 90° would imply that BD is a diameter? Wait, but in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but not sure.

Wait, but if angle ABC is 90°, then AB ⊥ BC. Similarly, angle CDB is 90°, meaning CD ⊥ DB. Hmm. So in cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, AB ⊥ BC and CD ⊥ DB. Let me try to visualize this.

Let me consider coordinates. Suppose we place point B at origin (0,0). Since AB is horizontal (assuming AB is along x-axis), and BC is vertical (since angle ABC is 90°). Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s set B at (0,0). Let’s assume AB is along x-axis, so A could be at (a,0) for some a>0. BC is vertical, so C is at (0,c) for some c>0. Now, since ABCD is cyclic, point D must lie somewhere such that CD is perpendicular to DB. Let me find coordinates for D.

First, equation of circle passing through A(a,0), B(0,0), C(0,c). Let me find its equation. General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in B(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 ⇒ F=0. Plugging in A(a,0): a² + 0 + D*a + 0 + 0 = 0 ⇒ D = -a. Plugging in C(0,c): 0 + c² + 0 + E*c + 0 = 0 ⇒ E = -c. So the equation becomes x² + y² - a x - c y = 0.

Now, point D lies on this circle. Also, CD is perpendicular to DB. Vector CD is D - C. Let’s denote D as (x,y). Then vector CD = (x - 0, y - c) = (x, y - c). Vector DB is B - D = (-x, -y). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(x)(-x) + (y - c)(-y) = 0 ⇒ -x² - y(y - c) = 0 ⇒ x² + y² - c y = 0.

But since D lies on the circle, x² + y² - a x - c y = 0. Subtracting the previous equation from the circle equation gives:

(x² + y² - a x - c y) - (x² + y² - c y) ) = -a x = 0 ⇒ -a x = 0 ⇒ x = 0. So D lies on x=0. But point C is already at (0,c). So D must be at (0, k), but since ABCD is a quadrilateral, D cannot coincide with C. Thus, D is another intersection point of line x=0 with the circle. Substituting x=0 into the circle equation:

0 + y² - 0 - c y = y² - c y = 0 ⇒ y(y - c)=0 ⇒ y=0 or y=c. So points (0,0) and (0,c). But those are points B and C. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, our assumption leads to a contradiction, implying that such a cyclic quadrilateral with angle ABC and angle CDB being right angles is impossible unless D coincides with another point, which isn't allowed. 

Wait, this suggests that my approach might be wrong. Maybe the cyclic quadrilateral is not convex? Or perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the position of D. Alternatively, maybe angle CDB is not referring to the internal angle of the quadrilateral. Wait, angle CDB is angle at D between C, D, B. In the cyclic quadrilateral, that angle is related to arcs. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, angle ABC and angle ADC are supplementary. But if angle ABC is 90°, then angle ADC is 90°, making ABCD a rectangle? No, because in that case, all angles would be 90°, but angle CDB would also be 90°, which would make BD a diagonal. Wait, in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but each diagonal splits the rectangle into two congruent triangles. However, in that case, angle CDB would be 45° if ABCD is a square, but that contradicts the given right angle. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

If ABCD is a rectangle, then angle ABC is 90°, and angle ADC is also 90°. Point D is connected to C and B. In a rectangle, angle CDB would be angle between DC and DB. Let me take coordinates again. Let’s suppose ABCD is a rectangle with A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,b), D(0,b). Then point D is (0,b). Then vector DC is C - D = (a,b) - (0,b) = (a,0). Vector DB is B - D = (a,0) - (0,b) = (a,-b). The angle at D between DC and DB is the angle between vectors DC=(a,0) and DB=(a,-b). The tangent of that angle would be slope difference. But the angle itself: using dot product:

cos(theta) = (DC • DB)/(|DC||DB|) = (a*a + 0*(-b))/(a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a² / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²). So theta is arccos(a/sqrt(a² + b²)), which is not 90° unless a=0, which would collapse the rectangle. Therefore, angle CDB is not 90° in a rectangle. Hence, contradiction arises. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumptions.

This suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or I'm missing key information. Alternatively, maybe ABCD is not a convex quadrilateral, or the right angles are not internal angles. Alternatively, maybe angle CDB is not part of the quadrilateral but another construction.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic quadrilateral has angles ABC and ADC as right angles, but angle CDB refers to something else. Wait, angle CDB is angle at D between C, D, B. If ABCD is cyclic, then angle CDB equals angle CAB because they subtend the same arc CB. Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, angles subtended by the same chord are equal. So angle CDB and angle CAB both subtend arc CB. So if angle ABC is 90°, then angle CAB is something else. Wait, but maybe I need to apply some theorems here.

Alternatively, since angle ABC is 90°, then AC is the diameter of the circle. Because in a circle, if an inscribed angle subtends a diameter, it's a right angle. So if ABC is 90°, then AC must be the diameter of the circle. Similarly, angle CDB is 90°, so angle CDB subtends an arc CB. If angle CDB is 90°, then CB must be the diameter? Wait, no. Because angle at D subtending arc CB would mean that CB is the diameter if angle CDB is 90°, since the inscribed angle over the diameter is 90°. Wait, yes! If angle CDB is 90°, then CB must be the diameter of the circle. Because angle subtended by CB at D is 90°, hence CB is the diameter. But earlier we had AC as diameter due to angle ABC being 90°. Therefore, both AC and CB are diameters, implying that points A, C, and B lie on the same straight line? Which would make ABC a straight line, contradicting the quadrilateral. Hence, contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency unless points A, B, C are colinear, which they aren't in a quadrilateral. Hence, this implies that my interpretation of the problem might be incorrect.

Perhaps I misread the angles. Let me re-examine the given constraints. It says:

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) → angle at B between A-B-C is right angle.

RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)) → angle at D between C-D-B is right angle.

Ah! Wait, angle at D between C-D-B is angle CDB, which is at D. Earlier, I thought that if angle CDB is 90°, then CB is diameter, but if angle ABC is 90°, then AC is diameter. Hence, both AC and CB are diameters, implying that A, C, B are colinear, which is impossible unless ABC is degenerate. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the cyclic quadrilateral is not convex? Or maybe the points are arranged differently. Let me try to imagine a different arrangement. Suppose ABCD is cyclic with AB ⊥ BC and CD ⊥ DB. Let me try to construct such a figure.

Let’s consider a circle with diameter AC. Then, any point B on the circle will satisfy angle ABC being 90°, because it subtends the diameter AC. Now, for angle CDB to be 90°, point D must be such that angle CDB is 90°, which would mean that CB is the diameter. Wait, if CB is the diameter, then D must lie on the circle such that angle CDB is 90°. But if CB is the diameter, then D lies anywhere on the circle except C or B. Wait, but if AC is the diameter (from earlier), and CB is also the diameter, then AC and CB are the same line, making points A, C, B colinear, which is again a contradiction. 

Therefore, the only way both angles ABC and CDB can be right angles is if AC and CB are both diameters, which forces A, C, B to be collinear, making ABCD degenerate. This suggests that the problem might have an error, or perhaps my understanding of the angle positions is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe angle CDB is not subtended by the same arc as ABC. Let me recall the property: in a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle. Or, in terms of angles subtended by arcs.

Another approach: Let me forget coordinates and think about properties. In cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, with angle ABC = 90° and angle CDB = 90°. Since ABCD is cyclic, the power of point relations might help. Or maybe using the fact that angles subtended by the same chord are equal.

Since angle ABC is 90°, AC is the diameter of the circle. Then, for angle CDB to be 90°, point D must lie on the circle such that CB is the diameter? Wait, no. If angle CDB is 90°, then CB must be the diameter. But if AC is also the diameter, then CB and AC are both diameters, implying that C is the midpoint of AB, and B is the midpoint of AC? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the arcs. Let me think: angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc ADC. Since angle ABC is 90°, arc ADC must be 180°, making ADC a semicircle. Similarly, angle CDB is an inscribed angle subtending arc CAB. Since angle CDB is 90°, arc CAB must be 180°. Hence, arc ADC and arc CAB are both semicircles, implying that the entire circumference is covered by these arcs. This would mean that arc ADC is 180°, arc CAB is 180°, but together they cover the whole circle, which would mean that points A, C, B are positioned such that moving from A to D to C to B covers the circle, but this seems complex.

Alternatively, this suggests that the circle has diameter AC and CB, but this is only possible if AC and CB are the same line, leading to the same contradiction. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps there's a different approach. Let me focus on the question: Find m∠GBE. The problem mentions angles involving G and H at point B, with right angles. Possibly, points G and H are such that BG and BH are perpendicular to BE, forming right angles at B. But how do these relate to the cyclic quadrilateral?

Maybe BE is a diagonal or a line connecting to some point. Without knowing where E is, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps E is the intersection of lines AB and CD? Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the intersection of AB and CD is outside the circle. Let me assume E is the intersection of AB and CD extended. Let's say lines AB and CD meet at point E. Then, angles at E involve BE. 

Wait, if E is the intersection of AB and CD, then lines EB and EC would form some angles. But the problem mentions RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E)) and RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E)). So angle at B between G-B-E and H-B-E are right angles. If G and H are points on lines AB and CD respectively, then perhaps BG is perpendicular to BE, and BH is perpendicular to BE, making BG parallel to BH? But if both are perpendicular to BE, then BG and BH are both perpendicular to BE, so they are parallel to each other. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Let me try to outline steps:

1. ABCD is cyclic with ∠ABC = 90° and ∠CDB = 90°.
2. Lines AB and CD intersect at point E.
3. Points G and H are such that ∠GBE and ∠HBE are right angles.
4. Need to find measure of ∠GBE, which is given as a right angle? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E)), so ∠GBE is 90°, but the question asks for m∠GBE, which would be 90°, but that's not among the choices. Wait, the answer choices are 60, 120, 240, 360. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, the problem says "RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E))" and "RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E))", so both angles at B are right angles. But the question is asking for m∠GBE, which is one of those right angles, so it should be 90°, but that's not an option. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for ∠GBE, but in the context of the diagram, it's not directly a right angle. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Original problem says: "Find m∠GBE." And the constraints include RightAngle(Angle(G,B,E)) and RightAngle(Angle(H,B,E)). So if both angles at B involving G and H are right angles, then ∠GBE is 90°, but none of the answer choices is 90. Hence, this suggests that perhaps the question is not about ∠GBE but another angle, or there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo and the question is asking for ∠GBH or something else? Or maybe the angles at E?

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at E are being referred to, but the problem says "Angle(G,B,E)", which is angle at B. 

Given the confusion, perhaps I need to look for another approach. Let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral with two right angles. If ABCD is cyclic with ∠ABC = 90° and ∠ADC = 90°, then ABCD is a rectangle, but earlier analysis showed contradictions. Alternatively, if ∠ABC = 90° and ∠CDB = 90°, then using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be expressed in terms of the sides, but I don't know the lengths. Alternatively, using trigonometry.

Alternatively, since ∠ABC = 90°, then AC is the diameter. Let me denote O as the center of the circle. Then, O is the midpoint of AC. Now, ∠CDB = 90°, so point D lies on the circle such that ∠CDB = 90°. As previously discussed, this implies that CB is the diameter. But if AC and CB are both diameters, then AC and CB are the same line, making ABC a straight line. Contradiction again.

This suggests that the problem might have an error, or perhaps the angles are not inside the quadrilateral. Maybe ∠CDB is an external angle? Or maybe it's a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic quadrilateral is self-intersecting, like a bowtie shape, but that complicates things further.

Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradictions, perhaps I should shift focus to the final question about ∠GBE. Assume that despite the inconsistencies in the cyclic quadrilateral, there is a standard configuration where ∠GBE is determined by some properties.

If lines AB and CD intersect at E, then BE is a transversal. If G and H are feet of perpendiculars from B to BE? No, because if ∠GBE is a right angle, then G is somewhere on the line perpendicular to BE at B. Similarly for H. But without knowing where G and H are, it's hard to determine ∠GBE.

Wait, but if both ∠GBE and ∠HBE are right angles, then G and H lie on lines perpendicular to BE at B. So, if you draw two lines through B, each perpendicular to BE, then G and H are on those lines. But how does this relate to the rest of the diagram?

Maybe G and H are intersections of other lines. For example, if G is the intersection of BE with some other line, but without more info, it's too vague.

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, and E is the intersection of AB and CD, then by the power of a point, we have EA * EB = EC * ED. But how does this help?

Alternatively, considering triangle BEC or BED.

But without concrete relationships, it's difficult. Given that I'm stuck on the cyclic quadrilateral part, perhaps I should consider that the answer is 90°, but since it's not an option, maybe the actual angle is supplementary or complementary.

Wait, the answer choices include 120°, which is common in cyclic quadrilaterals with certain configurations. Let me assume that despite the contradictions in the cyclic quadrilateral setup, the angle ∠GBE is 120°, possibly derived from some triangle or cyclic properties.

Alternatively, since there are two right angles at B, and if BE is a line creating some relationship, maybe ∠GBE is 180° - 90° = 90°, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the diagram involves multiple right angles at B, and ∠GBE is part of a larger angle. For example, if there are two right angles at B, then the total angle around point B is 360°, and if ∠GBE is one of them, but without knowing the others, it's unclear.

Given the time I've invested and lack of progress, I'll hazard a guess based on common angles in such problems. Often, in cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles, angles involving diagonals or intersections can lead to 120° or 60°. Since the options are 60, 120, 240, 360, and 120 is a common supplement to 60, I'll go with 120° as the most likely answer, choosing B.
