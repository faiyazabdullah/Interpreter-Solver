PREDICATES:
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(6)

QUESTION:
m \angle 3 = x - 12 and m \angle 6 = 72. Find x.

CHOICES:
A. 6
B. 18
C. 72
D. 84

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that the measure of angle 3 equals the measure of angle 6. So, m∠3 = m∠6. Then we're given that m∠3 is x minus 12, and m∠6 is 72. Wait, so they're saying those two angles are equal? That means their measures should be the same. 

So if I set them equal to each other, it would be x - 12 equals 72. Because m∠3 is x - 12, and m∠6 is 72, and since they're equal, I can write the equation x - 12 = 72. Then solving for x, I need to add 12 to both sides. So x = 72 + 12, which is 84. Let me check that again. If x is 84, then m∠3 is 84 - 12 = 72, which matches m∠6 being 72. That makes sense. 

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 84. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me make sure there aren't any other factors. The problem mentions geometric constraints, but the only info given is about angles 3 and 6 being equal. There's no mention of triangles, parallel lines, or anything else. So maybe they're just two angles that are congruent, like vertical angles or something. But regardless, the key point is that their measures are equal. Therefore, setting them equal gives x - 12 = 72. Solving gives x = 84. So yes, answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Given the equality of the measures of Angle 3 and Angle 6, we have:

$$
m\angle 3 = m\angle 6
$$

Substituting the given expressions:

$$
x - 12 = 72
$$

Solving for $ x $:

$$
x = 72 + 12 \\
x = 84
$$

**Final Answer: D**
