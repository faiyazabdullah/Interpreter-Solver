MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two quadrilaterals, ABCD and AEFG, sharing the point A. The question says they're similar polygons. Also, there are some angle measures given and side lengths. We need to find the measure of angle ADC, which is denoted as ∠ADC.

First, let me recall that when two polygons are similar, their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in proportion. Since both are quadrilaterals, their order of vertices matters for similarity. The notation says Polygon ABCD ~ Polygon AEFGB? Wait, no, it's written as Polygon A B C D ~ polygon A E F G. So the order is important here. Let me check again.

Original problem states: "Polygon A B C D ∼ polygon A E F G". So the first quadrilateral is ABCD, and the second is AEFG. But since they are quadrilaterals, they should have four sides each. Wait, but AEFG has points A, E, F, G—so four points. Similarly, ABCD has four points. So similarity between ABCD and AEFG. Therefore, the correspondence would be A corresponds to A, then B corresponds to E, C corresponds to F, D corresponds to G? Or maybe another order?

Wait, in similarity, the order of the letters matters. For example, if ABCD ~ WXYZ, then AB corresponds to WX, BC to XY, CD to YZ, DA to ZW. So in our case, since ABCD ~ AEFG, so vertex A corresponds to A, B corresponds to E, C corresponds to F, D corresponds to G. Because the second polygon is A-E-F-G. So the order is A, E, F, G. So the correspondence is:

A -> A

B -> E

C -> F

D -> G

Therefore, the sides correspond as follows:

AB corresponds to AE,

BC corresponds to EF,

CD corresponds to FG,

DA corresponds to GA.

So the ratio of similarity would be the ratio of corresponding sides. 

Given that, we can use the given side lengths to find ratios and then apply them to find missing information.

Now, the problem gives us several measurements:

- Measure of angle AGF is 108 degrees. Wait, angle at G in triangle AGF? Or angle at G in quadrilateral AEFG? Let me check the original problem statement again.

In the problem, it says "m∠AGF = 108", so that's angle at G between points A, G, F. So that's part of quadrilateral AEFG. Since AEFG is similar to ABCD, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So angle AGF in AEFG corresponds to which angle in ABCD?

Since the correspondence is A->A, E->B, F->C, G->D. Wait, hold on. If ABCD ~ AEFG, then the angles correspond accordingly. Let me think carefully.

Let me list the angles:

In quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are at A, B, C, D.

In quadrilateral AEFG, the angles are at A, E, F, G.

Because of the similarity, angle at A in ABCD corresponds to angle at A in AEFG.

Similarly, angle at B in ABCD corresponds to angle at E in AEFG.

Angle at C in ABCD corresponds to angle at F in AE F G.

Angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEFG.

But wait, the problem mentions angle AGF. That is angle at G between points A, G, F. In quadrilateral AEFG, that would be angle at G. So angle AGF is the angle at G in AEFG. Which corresponds to angle at D in ABCD because of the similarity. Therefore, angle ADC (which is angle at D in ABCD) is congruent to angle AGF. Wait, but the problem says angle AGF is 108 degrees. So does that mean angle ADC is also 108 degrees? But that would make the answer C. However, I need to verify if that's accurate.

Wait, but let me confirm the correspondence again. If ABCD ~ AEFG, then angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEFG. Because in ABCD, the order is A-B-C-D-A, and in AEFG, it's A-E-F-G-A. So the fourth vertex of ABCD is D, which corresponds to the fourth vertex of AEFG, which is G. Hence, angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEFG. Therefore, angle ADC is angle at D in ABCD, which corresponds to angle at G in AEFG. But angle AGF is angle at G in AEFG. Therefore, angle AGF equals angle ADC. Thus, since angle AGF is 108°, then angle ADC is 108°, making the answer C. But wait, the answer choices include option C as 108. However, the problem might have more steps. Let me check again.

But the problem also gives some side lengths. Maybe there's something else here. Let me see the given data again:

GF = 14, AD = 12, DG = 4.5, EF = 8, AB = 26.

Wait, DG is given as 4.5. DG is part of which side? DG is from D to G. Wait, in the diagram, D is connected to A and C. Then, DG is a segment from D to G. But how is that related? Is DG part of a triangle or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps DG refers to the length of side DG? Wait, but DG isn't necessarily a side of either quadrilateral. Wait, the problem says "DG = 4.5"—but in the quadrilaterals, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA for ABCD; and AE, EF, FG, GA for AEFG. So DG is not a side of either quadrilateral. Unless there's a line connecting D to G. But the problem didn't mention such a line. However, the user included in the initial constraints lines like Line(A,D), etc., but maybe DG is a diagonal or something else?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, under the "GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS," there are lines listed as:

Line(A,B)

Line(B,C)

Line(C,D)

Line(D,A)

Line(A,E)

Line(E,F)

Line(F,G)

Line(G,A)

So those are the sides of the two quadrilaterals. So DG is not a side of either quadrilateral. Therefore, DG must refer to a segment connecting D to G. So maybe it's a diagonal or a transversal? But how do we know?

Alternatively, perhaps DG is part of triangle DGA or something else. Let me consider that.

But given that GF = 14, which is a side of quadrilateral AEFG. Since AEFG has sides AE, EF, FG, GA. So FG is one of its sides, which is given as 14. Also, EF is given as 8. And AB is given as 26. Also, AD is given as 12. DG is given as 4.5. Hmm.

Since the quadrilaterals are similar, the ratio of similarity can be determined by comparing corresponding sides.

Earlier, I thought that ABCD ~ AEFG with correspondence A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA.

But we know AB = 26. What is AE? Well, AE is a side of AEFG. Wait, AE is the first side of AEFG. Since the sides of AEFG are AE, EF, FG, GA. So AE corresponds to AB in ABCD. Wait, because in the similarity, AB corresponds to AE. So AB/ AE = ratio of similarity.

But we don't know AE yet. Alternatively, maybe we can find the ratio using known sides.

We know that in AEFG, FG = 14. FG corresponds to CD in ABCD. Because in ABCD, CD is the third side, which corresponds to FG in AEFG. So CD / FG = ratio. Similarly, DA corresponds to GA. DA is given as 12, and GA is a side of AEFG. But we don't know GA yet.

Additionally, DG is given as 4.5. How does DG relate to these figures? Let me think. If DG connects D to G, then maybe it's a diagonal in some figure? For instance, in quadrilateral ABCD, if you connect D to G, but G is a vertex of the other quadrilateral. This seems complicated. Maybe DG is part of triangle DGA or something else?

Alternatively, since DG is given, perhaps it's related to the ratio between sides. For example, if DG is part of a triangle involving D and G. Let me think about possible triangles.

If we look at quadrilateral AEFG, GA is one of its sides, and FG is another. So GA and FG are adjacent sides meeting at G. So angle at G is angle AGF, which is given as 108 degrees. So triangle AGF? Wait, AF is not necessarily a side. Wait, maybe triangle AGF? Let me see. Points A, G, F. So AF is a diagonal? Not sure.

But if we consider triangle AGF, then sides AG, GF, and AF. But we know GF = 14, and maybe other sides?

Alternatively, considering DG = 4.5. If DG connects D to G, then perhaps triangle DGA? Let me think. If we can find the length of AG, which is a side of AEFG, and DA is given as 12. Then DG could be a median or something else?

Alternatively, maybe DG relates to the ratio of similarity. Let me try to work through the ratios.

Assuming the similarity ratio k between ABCD and AEFG. Since ABCD ~ AEFG, so each side of ABCD is k times the corresponding side of AEFG.

But the correspondence is AB (from ABCD) corresponds to AE (from AEFG). So AB / AE = k. Similarly, BC / EF = k, CD / FG = k, DA / GA = k.

Given that, let's note down the known values.

From the problem:

AB = 26. EF = 8. FG = 14. DA = 12. DG = 4.5. Also, angle AGF = 108°, which we previously thought corresponds to angle ADC, so angle ADC = 108°, but maybe there's more to it?

Wait, but perhaps there's more than just angle correspondence. Let me check if DG is part of a triangle where we can apply the Law of Cosines or something else.

Suppose we consider triangle DGA. In this triangle, we have DA = 12, DG = 4.5, and AG is unknown. But if we can find AG, then we can use the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines. But how?

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, the ratio k is consistent across all sides. So if we can express AG in terms of other sides, maybe via the ratio.

For example, DA / GA = k => GA = DA / k = 12 / k.

Also, CD / FG = k => CD = k * FG = k * 14.

But CD is a side of ABCD. However, without knowing CD, maybe we can relate it to other parts?

Alternatively, let's consider EF = 8. Since EF corresponds to BC in ABCD. So BC / EF = k => BC = k * 8.

But again, not sure how that helps directly.

Wait, but maybe there's another relation. If DG is given as 4.5, perhaps DG is related to other sides. For instance, in triangle DGA, if we assume some relations.

But without more info, maybe we need to find k.

Let me think. Suppose we can find k using another pair of sides. For example, suppose we can find GA in terms of k, and then find another equation involving k.

From earlier, GA = 12 / k.

But GA is also a side of AEFG. Let's see if we can find GA through other means.

Looking at quadrilateral AEFG, which is similar to ABCD. The sides of AEFG are AE, EF=8, FG=14, and GA. Also, the angles are given. For example, angle at G is 108 degrees. If we can find other sides or angles, maybe we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle AGF or something.

Wait, in quadrilateral AEFG, angle at G is 108°, which is angle AGF. So in triangle AGF, we have sides AG, GF=14, and AF. But AF is not a side of the quadrilateral. However, if we consider triangle AGF, maybe we can relate sides using the Law of Cosines if we knew AF. But we don't know AF.

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, maybe the ratio can be found using another pair of sides. For example, if we can find the ratio between AB and AE, or between BC and EF, etc.

But we only know AB = 26 and EF = 8. If AB corresponds to AE, then AB / AE = k. But we don't know AE. However, if we can find AE in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, then the ratio between AB and AE is same as between BC and EF, same as between CD and FG, same as between DA and GA.

So, AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA.

We have AB = 26, EF = 8, FG = 14, DA = 12.

But we don't know AE, BC, CD, or GA. However, if we can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me denote the ratio as k = AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA.

So:

k = AB / AE → AE = AB / k = 26 / k.

k = BC / EF → BC = k * EF = 8k.

k = CD / FG → CD = 14k.

k = DA / GA → GA = DA / k = 12 / k.

Now, if we can find another relationship involving these variables, maybe from triangle DGA or something else.

Wait, DG = 4.5. Let me think about DG. DG connects D to G. How is this segment related to the quadrilaterals?

Possibly, DG is part of triangle DGA. In triangle DGA, we have sides DA = 12, DG = 4.5, and GA = 12/k. So if we can find the angle between DA and GA, we can use the Law of Cosines.

But what is the angle between DA and GA? In quadrilateral ABCD, DA is one side, and GA is a side from G to A. But G is part of the other quadrilateral. How does this relate?

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, the angles correspond. For example, angle at A in ABCD corresponds to angle at A in AEFG. Let's explore that.

In quadrilateral ABCD, angle at A is between DA and AB. In quadrilateral AEFG, angle at A is between GA and AE. Since they are similar, these angles are equal. So angle DAB (in ABCD) equals angle EAF (in AEFG).

But unless we have specific values for these angles, this might not help directly.

However, maybe considering triangle DGA. In triangle DGA, we have sides DA = 12, DG = 4.5, GA = 12/k. If we can find the angle between DA and GA, then we can apply the Law of Cosines.

But what is the angle between DA and GA? It depends on the structure of the figure. Let me visualize:

Point D is connected to A and C in ABCD. Point G is connected to A and F in AEFG. So DG connects D to G. To find the angle between DA and GA, which are sides meeting at A. Wait, DA is from D to A, and GA is from G to A. So they meet at A. So angle between DA and GA is the angle at A between DA and GA. Which would be angle DAG. But how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, maybe considering vectors or coordinates. Perhaps assigning coordinates to points to model the situation.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since DA is a side of ABCD, and DA = 12. Let me assume that DA lies along the x-axis for simplicity. So point D is at (12, 0), since DA = 12 units.

Then, point A is at (0,0), point D is at (12,0). Now, need to find coordinates of other points based on similarity and given info.

But since ABCD ~ AEFG, and we have some relationships between sides and angles.

Alternatively, since angle AGF is 108°, and we have FG = 14, GA = 12/k, and GF = 14. If we can model triangle AGF, which has sides AG, GF, and AF. But we don't know AF.

But maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle AGF:

AF² = AG² + GF² - 2 * AG * GF * cos(angle AGF)

Which is:

AF² = (12/k)² + 14² - 2*(12/k)*14*cos(108°)

But we don't know AF. However, AF might be related to other parts of the figure.

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, and AB = 26, which corresponds to AE in AEFG. So AE = AB / k = 26 / k. But AE is a side of AEFG, so AE is from A to E. If we can find coordinates for E, but this seems complex.

Alternatively, since we have DG = 4.5, and D is at (12, 0), G is somewhere. Let me attempt to find coordinates for G.

If I can express G in terms of the similarity ratio.

But this approach may get too involved. Let me think differently.

We have two expressions involving k: GA = 12/k, and from triangle DGA, if we can write an equation.

In triangle DGA, sides are DA = 12, DG = 4.5, GA = 12/k. Assuming the angle at A between DA and GA is θ, then by the Law of Cosines:

DG² = DA² + GA² - 2*DA*GA*cosθ

Plugging in:

(4.5)^2 = 12^2 + (12/k)^2 - 2*12*(12/k)*cosθ

But what is θ? θ is the angle between DA and GA at point A. In quadrilateral ABCD, DA is one side, and GA is a side from G to A. But G is part of the other quadrilateral. How is this angle related to other angles?

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEFG, the angle at A in ABCD (which is between DA and AB) corresponds to the angle at A in AEFG (between GA and AE). Let's call this common angle α. So angle DAB = angle EAF = α.

But how does that relate to angle θ in triangle DGA?

The angle θ in triangle DGA is the angle between DA and GA. This is different from angle DAB, which is between DA and AB. Unless GA is aligned with AB somehow, which we don't know.

This seems too vague. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, going back to the beginning. Earlier, I thought that angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF, hence being 108°, making answer C. But why did the problem give additional side lengths? Maybe there's a trick here.

Wait, maybe the assumption that angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF is incorrect. Let me re-examine the correspondence.

If ABCD ~ AEFG, then the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So ABCD ~ AEFG implies:

A corresponds to A,

B corresponds to E,

C corresponds to F,

D corresponds to G.

Thus, angle at A in ABCD corresponds to angle at A in AEFG,

angle at B in ABCD corresponds to angle at E in AEFG,

angle at C in ABCD corresponds to angle at F in AEFG,

angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEFG.

Therefore, angle ADC is angle at D in ABCD, which corresponds to angle at G in AEFG. Angle at G in AEFG is angle AGF, as per the problem's notation. Therefore, angle AGF = angle ADC. Hence, angle ADC = 108°, which would be answer C.

But why are the other side lengths given? Maybe to test if we fall into a trap of assuming direct correspondence, but actually, there's something wrong with that reasoning?

Wait, but the problem says "Polygon A B C D ∼ polygon A E F G". So the order is crucial. So the correspondence is A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. Therefore, the angles correspond as mentioned. So angle at D (of ABCD) corresponds to angle at G (of AEFG), which is angle AGF. Hence, angle ADC = angle AGF = 108°, so answer C.

But why are the side lengths given? Maybe to check if there's a contradiction? Or perhaps to confirm that the similarity holds?

Wait, maybe the given side lengths imply that the ratio is consistent, allowing us to find the value of k, but even if they are inconsistent, the angle correspondence still holds. However, if the given side lengths contradict the angle correspondence, then there might be an error. But since the problem provides all necessary information, likely the answer is indeed 108°, option C.

But let me double-check with the given side lengths to ensure consistency. For example, if the ratio k is consistent across all sides.

We have:

AB = 26 corresponds to AE. So AE = AB / k = 26/k.

EF = 8 corresponds to BC, so BC = k*8.

FG = 14 corresponds to CD, so CD = k*14.

GA corresponds to DA = 12, so GA = 12/k.

Additionally, DG = 4.5. How does DG fit into this?

If DG is a segment connecting D to G, and if we can find DG in terms of k, then we can solve for k.

But how?

Maybe considering triangle DGA, where DA = 12, GA = 12/k, and DG = 4.5.

If we can find the angle between DA and GA, which is angle at A between DA and GA. Let's call this angle φ.

Using Law of Cosines:

DG² = DA² + GA² - 2*DA*GA*cosφ

So:

(4.5)^2 = 12² + (12/k)^2 - 2*12*(12/k)*cosφ

But what is φ? It's the angle between DA and GA at point A. In quadrilateral ABCD, DA is one side, and in AEFG, GA is a side. The angle between DA and GA at A is influenced by the structure of both quadrilaterals.

But since ABCD ~ AEFG, the angle between DA and AB at A (which is angle DAB) is equal to the angle between GA and AE at A (angle GAE). But how does this relate to φ?

Unless φ is supplementary or something, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if we consider that in quadrilateral AEFG, angle at A is between GA and AE. Since AE corresponds to AB, which is a side of ABCD. So angle GAE (at A in AEFG) equals angle DAB (at A in ABCD).

But without knowing the measure of angle DAB or GAE, this might not help directly.

But maybe we can find φ in terms of other angles?

Alternatively, if we assume that φ is equal to angle DAB + something, but this is unclear.

Alternatively, if we consider that DG connects D to G, and since ABCD ~ AEFG, maybe there's a way to express DG in terms of other sides.

But I'm stuck here. Given that, maybe the side lengths are meant to confirm that the similarity is valid, but since the problem states that the polygons are similar, we can safely ignore the side lengths for the angle calculation. Because regardless of the side lengths, the corresponding angles must be equal.

Hence, angle ADC = angle AGF = 108°, so answer C.

But why is there an option C? Let me check the answer choices again:

A. 14

B. 72

C. 108

D. 120

Yes, option C is 108. So according to this reasoning, answer is C.

But wait, sometimes problems can have tricks. Let me think again. Could there be an error in the correspondence of the angles?

For example, maybe the similarity is not in the order I assumed. What if the correspondence is different?

The problem says "Polygon A B C D ∼ polygon A E F G". This usually means that the order of the vertices matches. So A corresponds to A, B to E, C to F, D to G. Hence, the angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEFG, which is angle AGF. So yes, angle ADC = angle AGF = 108°.

Another possibility: Maybe angle AGF is not the corresponding angle? For example, if the similarity is AEFGB instead of AEFG? No, the problem says polygon A E F G, so four vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a translation or rotation, but similarity preserves angles regardless.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is C, 108°.

But to be thorough, let me check if the given side lengths can help determine anything else. For example, if we calculate k using DG.

Assume that DG is part of triangle DGA. Using Law of Cosines:

DG² = DA² + GA² - 2*DA*GA*cosφ

Where φ is angle at A between DA and GA.

But if we can express φ in terms of other angles.

In quadrilateral ABCD, angle at A is between DA and AB. In quadrilateral AEFG, angle at A is between GA and AE. Since ABCD ~ AEFG, these angles are equal. Let's call this common angle α.

But φ is the angle between DA and GA at A. If we imagine that GA is a continuation or extension of AB or something, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if we assume that GA is aligned with AB, but that would depend on the specific shape.

But since we don't have enough information about the angles or other sides, it's impossible to calculate k from this. Hence, the given side lengths might be red herrings for this particular question, which asks about the angle, not the sides.

Therefore, sticking with the angle correspondence, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given information:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding Similarity**

We are told that:

> **Polygon ABCD ∼ Polygon AEFG**

This indicates that the two quadrilaterals are **similar**, meaning their **corresponding angles are equal** and their **sides are proportional**.

To identify the **corresponding vertices**, we examine the order of the vertices in both polygons:

- **Polygon ABCD**: Vertices are A, B, C, D  
- **Polygon AEFG**: Vertices are A, E, F, G  

Therefore, the **vertex correspondence** is:

- A ↔ A  
- B ↔ E  
- C ↔ F  
- D ↔ G  

This mapping allows us to conclude:

- ∠ABC ↔ ∠AEF  
- ∠BCD ↔ ∠EFG  
- ∠CDA ↔ ∠FGA  
- ∠DAB ↔ ∠GAE

---

### **Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Angles**

We are asked to find the measure of **∠ADC**, which is the angle at vertex **D** in **quadrilateral ABCD**.

According to the above correspondence:

- ∠ADC (in ABCD) ↔ ∠FGA (in AEFG)

It is explicitly given in the problem:

> **m∠AGF = 108°**

Note that **∠AGF** is the angle formed at vertex **G** in **polygon AEFG**, specifically between segments **GA** and **GF**, i.e., ∠AGF = ∠FGA.

Thus, ∠ADC = ∠FGA = **108°**

---

### **Step 3: Verifying Consistency with Side Lengths**

Although the problem includes various side lengths (e.g., GF = 14, AD = 12, DG = 4.5, etc.), none of these affect the angular relationship due to the **similarity of polygons**. These side lengths could be used to compute ratios or proportions, but **since the question only asks for the angle**, the side lengths are **not needed** to determine the angle measure.

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the similarity of the two quadrilaterals and the given angle ∠AGF = 108°, we conclude that:

$$
\boxed{\text{m} \angle ADC = \text{m} \angle AGF = 108^\circ}
$$

---
