MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have angles ∠2 and ∠3, with measures m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. The question is asking for the measure of ∠2. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. 

First, I need to recall the given geometric constraints. The problem mentions Angle(A,B,G,∠2) and Angle(A,B,J,∠3). That notation might mean that both angles share a common vertex at point B, with sides BA and BG forming angle ∠2, and BA and BJ forming angle ∠3. Wait, so points G and J are on different lines from point B? Maybe they're on opposite sides of BA?

But wait, maybe it's about adjacent angles or something else. Let me think. If two angles share a common side (BA), then their sum could relate to some larger angle. But since both angles have BA as a common side, perhaps they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair or part of a triangle?

Wait, but there's also the condition that the measures of these two angles are equal. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J))). So, the measure of angle ABG (∠2) equals the measure of angle ABJ (∠3). Wait, but if those two angles are equal, then how can they be arranged? Unless they are vertical angles? Or maybe they are parts of a triangle?

Hold on, maybe points G and J are on different lines from point B, such that angles ABG and ABJ are formed. For example, suppose line BG and line BJ are on opposite sides of BA, making angles ∠ABG and ∠ABJ. Then, if those angles are equal, maybe they form a straight line? Wait, no. If they are on opposite sides, then the total angle around point B would be ∠ABG + ∠ABJ. But if they are equal, then each would be half of a straight angle? Wait, but a straight angle is 180 degrees. So if ∠ABG and ∠ABJ are supplementary? No, because if they are on opposite sides, adding up to a straight line, then their sum would be 180°, so if they are equal, each would be 90°. But that would make them right angles. However, the problem states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. If they are equal, then 2x = x? Which implies x=0, which isn't possible. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not on opposite sides. Suppose points G and J are on the same side of BA. Then, angles ABG and ABJ would overlap? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are angles inside a triangle? Let's consider triangle ABJ and ABG? Not sure yet.

Wait, another possibility: if points G and J are such that lines BG and BJ are rays from point B, creating angles with BA. If ∠ABG and ∠ABJ are adjacent angles, then maybe they form a larger angle. Wait, but if they are adjacent, then their sum would be the measure of angle AJG or something else? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw a rough sketch mentally.

Imagine point B with ray BA going off in some direction. From point B, there are two other rays: BG and BJ. Suppose angle between BA and BG is ∠ABG (∠2), and angle between BA and BJ is ∠ABJ (∠3). Now, if BG and BJ are on the same side of BA, then depending on their positions, angles could add up. But if they are on opposite sides, then their sum would be 180°, but earlier that led to contradiction. 

But the key thing is that the measures of these two angles are equal. So, m∠ABG = m∠ABJ. So, if angles ABG and ABJ are equal, then maybe lines BG and BJ are symmetric with respect to BA? Like reflecting over BA? So that angles on either side are equal. But again, without more information, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe this is related to triangle angles. Suppose there is a triangle involving points A, B, and another point. Wait, maybe points G and J are points on a line through B? Or maybe this is about parallel lines and transversals?

Alternatively, considering that angles ABG and ABJ are equal, and given that their measures are 2x and x respectively. Wait, hold on! The problem says that the measure of angle ABG is equal to the measure of angle ABJ. Wait, but according to the problem statement:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J))"

So that means MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J)). So, m∠ABG = m∠ABJ. But the problem also says that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. Wait, but the angles mentioned are ∠2 and ∠3. So maybe ∠2 is ∠ABG and ∠3 is ∠ABJ? So their measures are equal. But then according to the problem, m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. But if they are equal, then 2x = x ⇒ x = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo or misstatement. Wait, let me re-read the problem.

The problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Angle(A,B,G,∠2)
Angle(A,B,J,∠3)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J)

So, the first line defines angle ABG as ∠2, and angle ABJ as ∠3. Then, the next line says that the measure of angle ABG equals the measure of angle ABJ. So, m∠ABG = m∠ABJ. Therefore, m∠2 = m∠3. However, the question says that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. So combining these, 2x = x ⇒ x = 0, which is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup or my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the labels are different. Perhaps ∠2 refers to angle ABJ and ∠3 refers to angle ABG? Or maybe the angles are not directly ABG and ABJ, but something else?

Wait, maybe the angles are not ABG and ABJ, but instead, maybe the angles are at point B, with different vertices. Let me parse the angle notation. In standard notation, angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A and C. So, Angle(A,B,G) would be the angle at point B between points A and G, i.e., ∠ABG. Similarly, Angle(A,B,J) is ∠ABJ. So the problem states that these two angles are equal. Hence, ∠ABG = ∠ABJ. But the problem also gives that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. Assuming that ∠2 corresponds to ∠ABG and ∠3 corresponds to ∠ABJ, then setting their measures equal leads to 2x = x ⇒ x = 0. Which is impossible. So there must be something wrong here.

Wait, unless the angles are not both at point B? Or perhaps the angles are not adjacent? Wait, maybe there is a diagram that goes along with this problem that we don't have access to. Since we only have text, maybe the problem is referring to angles in a triangle or some other configuration.

Another thought: maybe the angles are not adjacent. Suppose that points G and J are on different lines, and the angles are part of a triangle. For instance, if there is a triangle ABG and ABJ, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, maybe ∠2 and ∠3 are remote interior angles of a triangle. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a transversal and parallel lines? For example, if lines AG and AJ are cut by a transversal, but again, not enough info.

Wait, maybe it's about exterior angles? Suppose that ∠ABG and ∠ABJ are exterior angles of a triangle. But again, not enough context.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to vertical angles or corresponding angles? For instance, if lines BG and BJ are intersected by another line, creating equal angles. But again, without a diagram, it's tricky.

Wait, let's take a step back. The problem says that the measure of angle ABG equals the measure of angle ABJ. So, ∠ABG = ∠ABJ. And we're told that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. But if these angles are equal, then 2x = x ⇒ x = 0. Which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation of the angle labels.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not ∠ABG and ∠ABJ, but rather, ∠AGB and ∠AJB? Or some other combination? Let me check the original notation again.

Original constraints:

Angle(A,B,G,∠2) — likely meaning that the angle is at B, between A and G, so ∠ABG = ∠2.

Similarly, Angle(A,B,J,∠3) — angle at B between A and J, so ∠ABJ = ∠3.

Thus, the equality of their measures implies ∠ABG = ∠ABJ. But then the measures are given as m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. So unless there's a miscalculation here, this leads to a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe there's a translation error or a typo in the problem statement. For example, maybe the equal sign is meant to indicate something else, like the angles being supplementary or complementary? Or perhaps the problem meant that the measures are in a ratio?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the measure of angle ABG is equal to the measure of angle ABJ, but the problem also states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. Wait, but if m∠2 and m∠3 are the measures of these equal angles, then 2x = x, leading to x=0. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angles are not both at point B? Like, maybe angle 2 is ∠ABG and angle 3 is ∠GBJ, or something else. Let me think differently. Suppose that there is a triangle ABG where ∠ABG is angle 2, and another triangle ABJ where ∠ABJ is angle 3. But without knowing the relationship between triangles ABG and ABJ, it's hard to say.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the angles are vertical angles. If lines BG and BJ are actually the same line, but then the angles would be overlapping. Or if BG and BJ are different lines forming vertical angles with other lines. For example, if there is a line crossing BA at point B, creating vertical angles. But again, not enough info.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves an isosceles triangle. Suppose that in triangle ABG, angle at B is ∠ABG = ∠2, and in another triangle ABJ, angle at B is ∠ABJ = ∠3. If those two angles are equal, then... Well, unless there's more to the triangles.

Wait, let's assume that points G and J are on the same line extending from B. For example, if BG and BJ are on the same line, but in opposite directions. Then, angle ABG and angle ABJ would be supplementary. Because if you extend BG beyond B to J, then ∠ABJ would be a straight line, but that depends on the position. Wait, if BG is extended past B to J, then ∠ABJ would be a straight angle minus ∠ABG. So, ∠ABJ = 180° - ∠ABG. If they are equal, then ∠ABG = 180° - ∠ABG → 2∠ABG = 180° → ∠ABG = 90°. So, if that were the case, then m∠2 = 90°, which would mean 2x = 90° → x = 45°, and m∠3 = x = 45°. But then, the problem says that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, and they are equal. So, this scenario fits. 

Wait, in this case, if BG and BJ are in a straight line (so that J is on the extension of BG), then ∠ABJ would be supplementary to ∠ABG. But if the problem says that ∠ABG = ∠ABJ, then this would require that ∠ABG = 90°, as above. Thus, m∠2 = 90°, which would correspond to option D. But let's check if this makes sense.

If ∠ABG = 90°, then m∠2 = 90° = 2x ⇒ x = 45°, and m∠3 = x = 45°, which would mean that ∠ABJ = 45°. But earlier we said that ∠ABJ should be supplementary to ∠ABG, which would make it 90°, but this contradicts. Wait, no—this approach may be flawed.

Let me clarify: If J is on the extension of BG beyond B, then the angle ∠ABJ would be a straight line, but that's only if J is colinear with BG. Wait, no—if J is on the extension of BG beyond B, then the angle between BA and BJ would be 180° minus the angle between BA and BG. So, if ∠ABG is θ, then ∠ABJ would be 180° - θ. But the problem states that ∠ABG = ∠ABJ, so θ = 180° - θ ⇒ θ = 90°. So, in this case, ∠ABG = 90°, which is m∠2 = 90° = 2x ⇒ x = 45°, and m∠3 = x = 45°, which would be ∠ABJ = 45°. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that ∠ABJ = 180° - θ = 90°, because if θ = 90°, then ∠ABJ would be 90°, not 45°. So there's inconsistency here. 

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the location of J is incorrect. Maybe J is not on the extension of BG, but somewhere else. Let me try again.

Suppose that BG and BJ are two different rays from B, forming angles with BA. If ∠ABG and ∠ABJ are equal, then maybe they are congruent angles created by some symmetry. For example, if BA is the angle bisector of ∠GBJ. In that case, ∠ABG = ∠ABJ. So, if BA is the bisector of angle GBJ, then ∠ABG = ∠ABJ. But how does that help us find x?

In this case, if BA is the bisector of angle GBJ, then ∠GBJ = 2 * ∠ABG = 2*(2x) = 4x. But I'm not sure how this helps unless there's more information about the triangle or other angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABG and ABJ are similar or congruent? But without knowing more about the sides or other angles, it's hard to apply similarity.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that angles ABG and ABJ are equal, and together with another angle, they form a triangle. For example, if points G and J are on a line, forming triangle ABG and ABJ. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around point B. If there are multiple angles at point B, including ∠ABG and ∠ABJ, and others. For example, if BA is a common side, and BG and BJ are two other rays from B, then the sum of the angles around point B would depend on the arrangement. If ∠ABG and ∠ABJ are adjacent, then their sum would be part of a larger angle.

But without knowing the specific configuration, it's difficult. Given that the problem provides m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, and that they are equal, leading to 2x = x, which is impossible, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps there was a mistranslation or misformatting in the problem. Let me read the original problem again carefully:

"Angle(A,B,G,∠2)
Angle(A,B,J,∠3)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J)"

Maybe the "Equals" is supposed to indicate that the measure of angle ABG is equal to the measure of angle ABJ, but the actual problem is asking for m∠2, which is 2x, and m∠3 is x, and these are equal? But that still leads to 2x = x, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem intended that the measures are in a ratio, like m∠2 : m∠3 = 2:1, but not necessarily equal? Or maybe there's a typo and the equal sign should be a plus sign?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the measure of angle ABG is equal to the measure of angle ABJ, but the question is asking for m∠2, which is 2x, and m∠3 is x. Wait, but if they are equal, then 2x = x, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if there's a miscalculation or misread in the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem says that the measure of angle ABG is twice the measure of angle ABJ, or vice versa? Let me check the original problem again.

The user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J"

This seems like a formatting issue. Perhaps it should be:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,J))

Which would mean that the measure of angle ABG equals the measure of angle ABJ. But then, as before, if m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, this implies 2x = x, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem meant that the measure of angle ABG is equal to the measure of angle ABJ, but the question is asking for m∠2, which is 2x, and m∠3 is x, and the sum of these angles is something? For example, if they are adjacent angles forming a straight line, then their sum would be 180°, so 2x + x = 180° → 3x = 180° → x = 60°, so m∠2 = 2x = 120°, which is not among the options. Or if they are complementary, 2x + x = 90° → x = 30°, so m∠2 = 60°, which is option C. But this assumes that the angles are supplementary or complementary, which wasn't stated.

But why would they be supplementary or complementary? If the angles are adjacent and form a linear pair, then yes. But why would that be the case? Without knowing the diagram, it's speculative. But since the answer choices include 60°, which is option C, and if assuming that the angles are complementary, then x=30°, giving m∠2=60°, which is option C.

Alternatively, if they are supplementary, then x=60°, giving m∠2=120°, which is not an option. But if they are complementary, x=30°, giving m∠2=60°, which is option C. This could be the intended solution.

Given that the problem has answer choices and the most plausible assumption is that the angles are complementary, leading to x=30°, hence m∠2=60°, which is option C. So even though the problem as stated is ambiguous, this might be the expected answer.

Therefore, the Final Answer would be C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ m\angle 2 $, we begin by interpreting the given geometric constraints and relationships:

- **Angle(A,B,G)** corresponds to $ \angle ABG $, labeled as $ \angle 2 $
- **Angle(A,B,J)** corresponds to $ \angle ABJ $, labeled as $ \angle 3 $
- It is explicitly given that:
  $$
  m\angle 2 = 2x,\quad m\angle 3 = x
  $$

However, the problem further asserts that:
$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABG) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABJ)
$$
which translates to:
$$
m\angle 2 = m\angle 3
$$

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Equality Constraint

From the equality constraint:
$$
m\angle 2 = m\angle 3
$$
Substituting the expressions for the measures:
$$
2x = x
$$

This equation implies:
$$
x = 0
$$
which is **not valid**, as angle measures cannot be zero. This contradiction indicates that our initial assumption about the nature of the angles is incomplete or incorrect.

---

### Step 2: Reinterpret the Geometric Configuration

Since the direct equality of the angles leads to an invalid conclusion, we consider alternative configurations where the angles might not be directly equal, but instead, their **sum** forms a known geometric property (e.g., a straight angle).

Assume that $ \angle ABG $ and $ \angle ABJ $ are **adjacent angles** that together form a **linear pair**, i.e., they lie on a straight line. In such cases, the sum of their measures is $ 180^\circ $. This gives us:

$$
m\angle ABG + m\angle ABJ = 180^\circ
$$

Now substitute:
$$
2x + x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow 3x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x = 60^\circ
$$

Then:
$$
m\angle 2 = 2x = 2(60^\circ) = 120^\circ
$$

But 120° is **not** among the answer choices. This suggests that the angles might not be supplementary, but **complementary** (i.e., their sum is $ 90^\circ $):

$$
2x + x = 90^\circ \Rightarrow 3x = 90^\circ \Rightarrow x = 30^\circ
$$

Then:
$$
m\angle 2 = 2x = 2(30^\circ) = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Select the Closest Valid Answer

While the problem does not specify whether the angles are supplementary or complementary, the **most reasonable assumption** based on typical geometric problems and the presence of a valid answer choice is that the angles are **complementary**.

Hence, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{60}
$$
