MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in circle Z. The given information includes the measure of angle BZA as 104 degrees, the measure of arc CB as 94 degrees, and AB is parallel to DC. We need to find the measure of angle ZAC.

First, since ABCD is cyclic, all its vertices lie on the circumference of circle Z. That means opposite angles in the quadrilateral should sum up to 180 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Let me recall some theorems related to cyclic quadrilaterals and circles.

Also, there's mention of arcs and angles. Remember that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Wait, angle BZA is at point Z, which is the center of the circle because it's mentioned as part of the circle Z. Wait, hold on. If ABCD is inscribed in circle Z, then Z is the center? Or is Z just a point on the circle?

Wait, the term "cyclic quadrilateral (A,B,C,D,Z)" might imply that Z is another point on the circle? Hmm, maybe not. Typically, when you name a circle, like ⊙Z, Z would be the center. But sometimes people can refer to points on the circle. Wait, but the problem says Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in ⊙Z, so Z must be the center. Because otherwise, if Z were a point on the circle, then ABCD would be inscribed in the circle, but Z could be another point. However, the notation usually denotes Z as the center. Let me check the given angles.

The problem mentions angle BZA. If Z is the center, then angle BZA is a central angle intercepting arc BA. Wait, no. If angle BZA is formed by points B, Z, A, then the vertex is at Z, so yes, that's a central angle. Therefore, the measure of angle BZA would be equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts. Wait, but the intercepted arc between points B and A. Wait, but the problem states that the measure of arc CB is 94 degrees. So, arc CB is 94 degrees. Let me try to visualize the diagram.

Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D on circle Z (centered at Z). AB is parallel to DC. Given that AB || DC, so maybe some properties about alternate interior angles or something else. Also, angle BZA is 104 degrees. Since Z is the center, angle BZA is a central angle intercepting arc BA. Therefore, the measure of arc BA would be equal to 104 degrees. Wait, but wait. The measure of a central angle equals the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle BZA intercepts arc BA, then arc BA is 104 degrees.

But also given that arc CB is 94 degrees. So arc CB is 94 degrees. Now, since ABCD is cyclic, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So adding up arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360. But we know arc AB is 104 degrees, arc BC is 94 degrees. But we don't know arcs CD and DA yet. However, perhaps there's more relationships due to the fact that AB is parallel to DC.

Since AB is parallel to DC, maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate angles that are equal. But how does that relate to arcs? Alternatively, maybe considering the arcs subtended by those sides. For instance, since AB || DC, the arcs they cut off might have some relationship. Wait, but AB and DC are chords of the circle. When two chords are parallel, their arcs may have specific relations.

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to DC, the angles formed by these chords with respect to other lines might be equal. For example, if we consider transversal AD or BC intersecting AB and DC, but I'm not sure. Maybe using the property that the arcs between the endpoints of the chords?

Alternatively, think about the fact that AB || DC implies that the arcs subtended by AB and DC might be related. Wait, for instance, if two chords are parallel, then the arcs between their endpoints might add up to certain measures. But I need to think carefully.

Alternatively, since AB || DC, the angles formed by a transversal might be congruent. For example, angle BAD and angle ADC might be supplementary? Not sure. Wait, but since AB is parallel to DC, then maybe the arcs that correspond to the angles involving these sides.

Another approach: Let's note down all known arcs. Arc AB is 104°, arc BC is 94°. Let me denote arc CD as x and arc DA as y. Then total circumference:

arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 104 + 94 + x + y = 360. So 198 + x + y = 360 → x + y = 162°.

Now, since AB is parallel to DC, perhaps there's a relation between arcs AB and DC. Let me recall that if two chords are parallel, then the arcs between them might be related. For example, if AB || DC, then the arcs AB and DC might be congruent? Wait, but that's only if the chords are congruent. But since AB and DC are chords of the circle, being parallel doesn't necessarily mean they are congruent unless the arcs they subtend are equal.

Alternatively, since AB || DC, the arcs that they intercept might be related. Let me think about the angles formed by the chords. For example, the angle between AB and AD would be equal to the angle between DC and... Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe looking at the arcs intercepted by angles formed by the chords.

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to DC, the angles that AB makes with other chords might be equal to angles made by DC with other chords. Let me think about the arcs that are intercepted by angles involving AB and DC.

Alternatively, since AB || DC, the arcs subtended by AB and DC might have some relationship. Let me think about the arcs that are intercepted by angles at the center. For example, arc AB is 104°, as established earlier. What about arc DC? If AB || DC, then maybe the arcs AB and DC are related. Suppose that the arcs AB and DC are such that the difference between them relates to the other arcs.

Wait, another idea: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the measures of opposite angles is 180 degrees. However, since AB || DC, maybe some angles are equal. But angle at A and angle at D? Wait, since AB || DC, then consecutive angles would be supplementary. Wait, but ABCD is cyclic, so angle A + angle C = 180°, and angle B + angle D = 180°. Also, if AB || DC, then angle A and angle D are consecutive angles on the same side of the transversal AD. Wait, but since AB || DC, then angle A and angle D would be supplementary? Wait, angle A and angle D are consecutive angles in the quadrilateral. Wait, but in a trapezoid (if it's a trapezoid), consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Since AB || DC, ABCD is a trapezoid. So angle A + angle D = 180°, and angle B + angle C = 180°.

But since it's cyclic, angle A + angle C = 180°, and angle B + angle D = 180°. So combining with the trapezoid properties, angle A + angle D = 180°, and angle A + angle C = 180°, so angle D = angle C. Similarly, angle B + angle D = 180°, and angle B + angle C = 180°, so angle D = angle C. So angle C = angle D. Interesting.

But how does that help us? Let me see. Maybe not directly. Let's get back to arcs. Since AB || DC, maybe the arcs subtended by AB and DC have some relation. Let me think about the arcs. AB subtends arc AB, which is 104°, and DC subtends arc DC. But since AB || DC, maybe the arcs AB and DC are related. How?

If two chords are parallel, then the arcs they subtend might be congruent if they are equidistant from the center. But since AB and DC are chords of the circle, their lengths depend on their distance from the center. However, without knowing the radius or other info, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, think about the angles formed by the chords. For example, the angle between AB and AD would be equal to the angle between DC and DA? Not sure. Wait, since AB || DC, then the direction of AB and DC is the same. So, if we imagine the line AB going from A to B, and DC going from D to C, then maybe the arcs between these points have some symmetry.

Alternatively, since AB || DC, then the arcs intercepted by AB and DC might be related. For example, the arc AB plus arc DC equals something? Wait, if you consider the arcs that are intercepted by the sides AB and DC. But I need to think differently.

Wait, another thought: since AB || DC, the angles that AB makes with the other sides (AD and BC) would be equal to the angles that DC makes with those sides. For example, angle BAD equals angle CDA? Wait, no, because AB || DC, then angle BAD and angle ADC are supplementary. Wait, if AB || DC and AD is a transversal, then angle BAD and angle ADC are same-side interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle BAD + angle ADC = 180°. But since ABCD is cyclic, angle BAD + angle BCD = 180°, because opposite angles in cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180. Wait, so angle BAD + angle BCD = 180°, and angle BAD + angle ADC = 180°, implying that angle BCD = angle ADC. Hence, angle ADC = angle BCD. Which suggests that triangle ADC and triangle BCD might have some relations. Not sure yet.

But maybe focusing on arcs again. Since angle BZA is given as 104°, which is a central angle over arc BA, so arc BA is 104°. Also, arc BC is 94°, given. So let's try to figure out arc CD and arc DA.

Earlier, we had arc AB = 104°, arc BC = 94°, and arc CD + arc DA = 162°. Now, if we can find arc CD or arc DA, we can find the rest. 

But how do we use AB || DC? Maybe through the arcs. Since AB || DC, then the arcs that are intercepted by AB and DC might be related. Let me think about the arcs that are intercepted by AB and DC. AB intercepts arc from A to B, which is 104°, and DC intercepts arc from D to C. Let me call arc DC as x. Then, since AB || DC, maybe the arcs AB and DC are related. 

Wait, but how? If two chords are parallel, then the arcs between their endpoints might be congruent? Or maybe the arcs that they cut off? Not sure. Another idea: The arcs that are intercepted by the angles formed by the chords. For example, since AB || DC, then the angles formed by AB with AD and DC with DA would be supplementary, leading to some arc relationships.

Alternatively, think about the arcs that are intercepted by angles at point Z. Wait, Z is the center. So, for example, angle ZAB would be half the measure of arc ZB? No, angle at the center. Wait, angle ZAC is what we need to find. So angle ZAC is an angle at point Z between points A and C. Wait, no. Wait, angle ZAC is at point A? Wait, no. Wait, angle ZAC is the angle at point A between points Z and C. Wait, but Z is the center of the circle. So angle ZAC is an angle at point A, with vertex at A, between points Z and C. Wait, but Z is the center. So AZ is a radius, AC is a chord. So angle ZAC is formed by the radius AZ and the chord AC. So maybe we can find this angle using the arc that it intercepts?

Alternatively, since angle ZAC is at point A, but Z is the center. Wait, no. The notation angle ZAC means the angle at point A between points Z and C. Wait, no. Wait, angle ZAC would be at point A, with segments ZA and CA. So vertex at A, with sides AZ and AC. So, in terms of the circle, AZ is a radius from A to the center Z, and AC is a chord from A to C. So, angle between radius AZ and chord AC at point A. There's a theorem that says that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. But here, AZ is a radius, not a tangent. However, maybe we can relate this angle to the arc it intercepts.

Wait, the angle between a radius and a chord at the point of contact is equal to half the measure of the arc intercepted by the chord. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between the radius and the chord would be equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite. Wait, let me think. At point A, the radius AZ goes to the center. The chord AC goes from A to C. So, the angle between AZ and AC is angle ZAC. To find this angle, we can consider the arc that is intercepted by angle ZAC. Wait, but angle ZAC is at point A, so it's not an inscribed angle. Wait, but maybe if we extend the radius AZ beyond Z, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that AZ is a radius, and AC is a chord. The angle between them at point A is equal to half the measure of the arc from Z to C? Not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is half the sum or half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, but here, AZ is a radius, so it's not a chord unless extended. Wait, perhaps considering triangle AZC. Since Z is the center, AZ and CZ are both radii. So triangle AZC has two sides equal (AZ and CZ) if Z is the center. Wait, AZ is a radius, CZ is also a radius, so triangle AZC is isoceles with AZ=CZ. Therefore, angle ZAC is equal to angle ZCA. Wait, but angle ZAC is at point A, so maybe not. Wait, in triangle AZC, AZ and CZ are radii, so angles at A and C are equal. Wait, angle at Z is angle AZC. Wait, but angle ZAC is at point A. So angle ZAC is one of the base angles of triangle AZC. So if I can find the measure of angle AZC, then I can find angle ZAC.

So, angle AZC is the central angle intercepting arc AC. Therefore, measure of angle AZC is equal to the measure of arc AC. Once we know arc AC, then in triangle AZC, since it's isoceles with AZ=CZ, the base angles are equal. So angle ZAC = (180 - angle AZC)/2.

Therefore, if we can find arc AC, then we can compute angle ZAC.

So, the key is to find arc AC. How can we find arc AC?

We already know arc AB = 104°, arc BC = 94°, so arc AC would be arc AB + arc BC = 104 + 94 = 198°. Wait, but that's only if points A, B, C are in order around the circle. Wait, but depending on the position of the points, arc AC could be major or minor arc. Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, the order of the points matters. Let me confirm the order of the quadrilateral.

The quadrilateral is ABCD, so the order is A-B-C-D-A. So, moving around the circle, starting at A, then B, then C, then D, then back to A. So arc AB is from A to B, arc BC from B to C, arc CD from C to D, and arc DA from D to A.

Given that, arc AC would be from A to C passing through B, which is arc AB + arc BC = 104 + 94 = 198°, which is a major arc. But there's also the minor arc AC, which would be the other way around the circle. However, in the context of central angles, the measure depends on which arc we're talking about. But since angle AZC intercepts arc AC, and given that the quadrilateral is ABCD, likely the arc AC that doesn't contain point B. Wait, but depending on the positions. Wait, if the quadrilateral is convex and inscribed in the circle, then the arc AC that is opposite to BD. But since AB is parallel to DC, maybe the arcs have particular properties.

Wait, but if arc AC is 198°, then the central angle would be 198°, making triangle AZC have angles at A and C equal to (180 - 198)/2 = negative value, which is impossible. So that can't be right. Therefore, my assumption that arc AC is AB + BC is wrong. Probably, arc AC refers to the minor arc AC. So, if the major arc AC is 198°, then the minor arc AC would be 360 - 198 = 162°. So, arc AC is 162°, which would make sense. Therefore, angle AZC is 162°, and then angle ZAC would be (180 - 162)/2 = 9°, which would be option A. But wait, let's verify this.

Wait, why is arc AC the minor arc? Because if points A, B, C are in order, then the arc from A to C via B is major arc, while the other arc AC would be minor. So, if the central angle AZC intercepts the minor arc AC, then its measure is 162°, giving angle ZAC as (180-162)/2=9°, which matches option A. But before accepting that, let me check if arc AC is indeed minor.

But how do we know whether arc AC is major or minor? It depends on the configuration. Since AB || DC, which might influence the positioning of points. Let me think again.

Given that AB is parallel to DC, and ABCD is cyclic. In a cyclic trapezoid, it must be isosceles trapezoid. Wait, because in a cyclic trapezoid, it's necessary that it's isosceles. So AB || DC, and ABCD is cyclic ⇒ ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore, legs AD and BC are congruent, and base angles are equal.

In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. So angle at A equals angle at D, and angle at B equals angle at C. Also, the legs AD and BC are congruent.

But how does this affect the arcs? In an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides (legs) are congruent. Also, the arcs subtended by the legs would be congruent. Wait, but how does that help?

Alternatively, since AB || DC, then the arcs subtended by AB and DC must be related. For example, since AB and DC are parallel, the arcs they subtend might be congruent. Wait, but AB and DC are different chords. Unless the trapezoid is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis, but without knowing specifics, it's hard to say.

Wait, earlier calculation suggested that if arc AC is minor arc of 162°, then angle ZAC is 9°, which is option A. But let me re-examine the steps.

We had arc AB = 104°, arc BC = 94°, so arc AC (the major arc) is 104+94=198°, so minor arc AC is 360 - 198 = 162°. Then angle AZC, which is the central angle over arc AC, would be 162°, making triangle AZC have angles at A and C equal to (180-162)/2 = 9°, so angle ZAC is 9°, which is option A. However, let me check if arc AC is indeed the minor arc.

But in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs AD and BC are congruent. So arcs subtended by AD and BC would be congruent. So arc AD equals arc BC. Since arc BC is given as 94°, so arc AD is also 94°. Earlier, we had arc AB = 104°, arc BC = 94°, arc CD = x, arc DA = 94°. Wait, earlier, we had arc CD + arc DA = 162°, so if arc DA = 94°, then arc CD = 162 - 94 = 68°. Is that possible?

Yes, if arc DA is 94°, arc CD is 68°, then total arcs:

arc AB = 104°, arc BC = 94°, arc CD = 68°, arc DA = 94°, totaling 104+94+68+94 = 360°. Yes, that works. So arc DA is 94°, arc CD is 68°. 

Then, what about arc AC? Depending on the path. From A to C, either through B or through D. The arc through B is arc AB + arc BC = 104 + 94 = 198°, as before. The arc through D is arc DA + arc DC = 94 + 68 = 162°, which is the minor arc AC. So, angle AZC, the central angle over minor arc AC, is 162°, so angle ZAC is (180 - 162)/2 = 9°, which gives answer A. 

But let me double-check this logic. So, if arc AC is 162°, then the central angle is 162°, making triangle AZC with AZ and CZ as radii. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. So angle ZAC = angle ZCA = (180 - 162)/2 = 9°, yes. So angle ZAC is 9°, which is option A. 

But wait, the problem says "Find m∠ZAC". So according to this reasoning, the answer is 9°, which is option A. However, let me check if there's another way this could be approached, just to confirm.

Alternative approach: Using the fact that AB || DC, so the arcs subtended by AB and DC might be related. Since AB || DC, then the arcs that are intercepted by AB and DC would have measures that differ by twice the angle between them? Not sure. Alternatively, since AB || DC, then the arcs that are intercepted by AB and DC might be supplementary or something similar. But earlier calculations seem consistent.

Alternatively, using the fact that angle BZA is 104°, which is the central angle over arc BA, so arc BA is 104°. Arc BC is 94°, so arc BA + arc BC = arc BC + arc BA = arc from B to C to A? Wait, no. The arc from B to A is 104°, arc from B to C is 94°, so arc from A to C via B is 104 + 94 = 198°, as before. Then, arc from A to C the other way is 360 - 198 = 162°, which is the minor arc. Thus, angle ZAC is half the difference between the arcs? Wait, no. Angle at A between Z and C.

Wait, angle ZAC is not an inscribed angle, but rather involves a radius. Wait, but if we consider the angle between chord AC and radius AZ. There's a formula for that. The angle between a chord and a radius at the point of contact is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, let me recall. 

At point A, the angle between chord AC and radius AZ is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. Wait, the arc that is not containing A. Wait, the angle between chord AC and radius AZ would be equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. Wait, not sure. Let me think of a general case. Suppose we have a circle with center O, and a chord AC. At point A, the angle between chord AC and radius OA is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't include OA. Wait, no. Actually, the angle between the radius and the chord is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the chord. Wait, no. The angle between the radius and the chord is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite. 

Wait, let me look for a better method. Since AZ is a radius, and AC is a chord. The angle between AZ and AC at point A is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. Wait, but the intercepted arc would be... Well, if you draw AZ and AC, the angle between them is ∠ZAC. This angle is formed by a tangent and a chord? No, AZ is a radius, not a tangent. But maybe we can relate it to the arc.

Alternatively, consider extending AZ to meet the circle again at another point, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the circle and calculating the angle. But that might take longer.

Alternatively, consider triangle AZC. As before, AZ and CZ are radii, so triangle AZC is isoceles with AZ=CZ. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. The angle at Z is the central angle over arc AC, which is 162°, so the other two angles are each (180 - 162)/2 = 9°, confirming angle ZAC is 9°. Therefore, answer A.

But let me cross-verify with another approach. Since angle BZA is 104°, which is the central angle over arc BA. Arc BA is 104°, arc BC is 94°, so arc BA + arc BC = arc BC + arc BA = arc from B to A to C? No, arc from B to C is 94°, arc from B to A is 104°, so arc from A to C via B is 104 + 94 = 198°, as before. Therefore, arc AC is 198°, which is the major arc. But the minor arc AC is 360 - 198 = 162°, which is the arc that is used for angle AZC. Therefore, angle AZC = 162°, leading to angle ZAC = 9°, so answer A.

Alternatively, thinking about the inscribed angle. Suppose we want to find angle ZAC. If we can express this angle in terms of other arcs. For example, angle ZAC is an angle at point A, between Z and C. Since Z is the center, AZ is a radius. If we consider the inscribed angle that intercepts arc ZC or something. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, consider drawing the radius CZ. Then, angle ZAC is part of triangle AZC, which we've already considered.

Another way: The measure of angle ZAC is equal to half the measure of arc ZC minus arc something? Not sure. Alternatively, since AZ is a radius, and AC is a chord, then angle ZAC is equal to half the measure of arc ZC. Wait, no. Wait, if we think of angle between radius AZ and chord AC, then the angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the chord AC. Wait, no, that's the inscribed angle. Wait, the angle between the chord AC and the tangent at A would be half the measure of the intercepted arc. But here, instead of tangent, it's a radius. 

Alternatively, the angle between the radius AZ and the chord AC is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. Wait, suppose we have point A, radius AZ, and chord AC. Then, the angle between AZ and AC is equal to half the measure of arc AC that is opposite to the angle. Wait, but the arc AC that is opposite would be the arc that doesn't contain Z. Since Z is the center, the arc AC that doesn't contain Z is the minor arc AC, which is 162°, so half of that would be 81°, which contradicts our previous conclusion. So this seems conflicting.

Wait, that can't be. Where is the mistake here? If the angle between the radius and the chord is half the measure of the arc, then angle ZAC would be half of arc AC. But arc AC is 162°, so angle ZAC would be 81°, which is not matching our prior result. So there's inconsistency here. So which is correct?

This indicates a possible error in my earlier reasoning. Let me resolve this discrepancy.

First, let's clarify: What is the measure of the angle between a radius and a chord at the point of contact?

According to standard geometry, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. However, in this case, we have a radius instead of a tangent. The radius is not a tangent; it's a line from the center to the circumference. So, how does this relate?

Let me consider the angle between the radius AZ and the chord AC. This angle is not a standard tangent-chord angle, but maybe we can derive it. Let's consider triangle AZC, where AZ and CZ are radii, and AC is a chord. The angle at A is angle ZAC, which we want to find.

In triangle AZC, we have AZ = CZ (radii), so it's an isoceles triangle with base AC and equal sides AZ and CZ. The apex angle at Z is angle AZC, which we determined was 162°, so the base angles at A and C are equal. Therefore, angle ZAC = (180° - 162°)/2 = 9°, as previously concluded.

However, according to the tangent-chord angle theorem, if we had a tangent at A, then the angle between the tangent and chord AC would be half the intercepted arc. But since we have a radius instead of a tangent, the relationship isn't direct. However, if we consider that the radius AZ forms a straight line with the tangent at A, then the angle between the radius and the tangent is 90°, since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent. So, if we imagine the tangent at A, the angle between the radius AZ and the tangent is 90°, and the angle between the tangent and the chord AC is half the measure of the arc AC. Let's denote that angle as θ, so θ = ½ arc AC. 

Then, the angle between the radius AZ and the chord AC would be 90° - θ. Because the radius AZ is perpendicular to the tangent, and the angle between the tangent and chord AC is θ, so the angle between the radius and chord AC is 90° - θ. 

Thus, angle ZAC = 90° - θ = 90° - ½ arc AC. 

But earlier, we said arc AC is 162°, so θ = ½ * 162 = 81°, thus angle ZAC = 90° - 81° = 9°, which matches our earlier result! So this confirms that angle ZAC is indeed 9°, so answer A. 

Therefore, despite the confusion earlier, the correct measure is 9°, which corresponds to option A. 

Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing that angle BZA is a central angle over arc BA, giving arc BA = 104°, arc BC = 94°, leading to arc AC (minor) = 162°, and using triangle AZC to find angle ZAC as 9°, confirmed by the tangent-chord relationship. All steps align, so the answer must be A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle ZAC $, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure and applying theorems related to cyclic quadrilaterals and central angles.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Configuration

We are told that quadrilateral $ABCD$ is **inscribed** in a circle centered at point $Z$. This implies that all four vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ lie on the circumference of the circle centered at $Z$. Additionally, it is given that:

- $\angle BZA = 104^\circ$
- $\overset{\frown}{CB} = 94^\circ$
- Line segment $AB \parallel DC$

Our goal is to find the measure of $ \angle ZAC $, i.e., the angle at point $A$ between segments $Z$ and $C$.

---

### Step 2: Use Central Angles and Arc Measures

Because $Z$ is the **center** of the circle, any angle formed at $Z$ by two points on the circle is a **central angle**, and its measure is equal to the **measure of the arc it intercepts**.

From this:

- $\angle BZA = 104^\circ$ implies that the arc $\overset{\frown}{BA} = 104^\circ$
- $\overset{\frown}{BC} = 94^\circ$ is explicitly given

Now, the full circle consists of four arcs:  
$$
\overset{\frown}{AB} + \overset{\frown}{BC} + \overset{\frown}{CD} + \overset{\frown}{DA} = 360^\circ
$$
Substituting known values:
$$
104^\circ + 94^\circ + \overset{\frown}{CD} + \overset{\frown}{DA} = 360^\circ
\Rightarrow \overset{\frown}{CD} + \overset{\frown}{DA} = 162^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the Parallel Chords Property

It is given that $AB \parallel DC$, and in a circle, **parallel chords intercept arcs whose measures are equal if they are congruent**. While the exact lengths aren’t given, the key insight is that the arcs $AB$ and $DC$ are related due to this parallelism.

Moreover, in an **isosceles trapezoid** (which this becomes due to the cyclic nature and parallel sides), the arcs subtended by the non-parallel sides (i.e., $AD$ and $BC$) are equal. Since $\overset{\frown}{BC} = 94^\circ$, it follows that $\overset{\frown}{AD} = 94^\circ$.

Using this, we find:
$$
\overset{\frown}{CD} = 162^\circ - \overset{\frown}{DA} = 162^\circ - 94^\circ = 68^\circ
$$

### Step 4: Determine Minor Arc $AC$

There are **two arcs** connecting points $A$ and $C$: the **major arc** and the **minor arc**.

- The **major arc** $AC$ passes through $B$, so its measure is:
  $$
  \overset{\frown}{AB} + \overset{\frown}{BC} = 104^\circ + 94^\circ = 198^\circ
  $$

- The **minor arc** $AC$ is therefore:
  $$
  360^\circ - 198^\circ = 162^\circ
  $$

### Step 5: Analyze Triangle $AZC$

We now focus on triangle $AZC$, where:

- $AZ$ and $CZ$ are both radii of the circle, so $AZ = CZ$
- Therefore, triangle $AZC$ is **isosceles**
- The angle at vertex $Z$, $\angle AZC$, is the central angle subtending the **minor arc** $AC$, which is $162^\circ$

In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal:
$$
\angle ZAC = \angle ZCA = \frac{180^\circ - \angle AZC}{2}
$$

Substitute:
$$
\angle ZAC = \frac{180^\circ - 162^\circ}{2} = \frac{18^\circ}{2} = 9^\circ
$$
