MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two triangles, triangle WZX and triangle SRT. They are similar, right? The question says they're similar, so that means their corresponding angles are equal and their sides are in proportion. 

First, I need to recall the properties of similar triangles. If two triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. That ratio is called the scale factor. Also, the perimeter of similar figures scales by the same scale factor. 

The problem gives some specific information. Let me jot down the given data:

- Triangle WZX ~ Triangle SRT (they are similar)
- ST = 6
- WX = 5
- Perimeter of triangle SRT = 15
- We need to find the perimeter of triangle WZX.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I get the correspondence of the vertices right. Since the similarity is written as Triangle(W,Z,X) ~ Triangle(S,R,T), that should mean the order of the letters matters for the correspondence. So vertex W corresponds to S, Z corresponds to R, and X corresponds to T. Because in similarity notation, the order of the vertices indicates which sides correspond. So side WZ corresponds to SR, ZX corresponds to RT, and XW corresponds to TS. 

But wait, the problem mentions that ST = 6. Let me check the labels again. In triangle SRT, the sides would be SR, RT, and TS. So ST is one of the sides. Wait, but in triangle SRT, the vertices are S, R, T. So the sides opposite those vertices would be... Let me think. For triangle SRT, side opposite S is RT, opposite R is ST, and opposite T is SR. Hmm. But maybe it's easier to just look at the sides based on the order. 

Alternatively, since the triangles are similar, the sides opposite the corresponding angles are proportional. Let me try to map the sides properly. 

Given that triangle WZX ~ triangle SRT, then:

Side WZ corresponds to side SR,

Side ZX corresponds to side RT,

Side XW corresponds to side TS.

So, if that's the case, then the length of WX in triangle WZX corresponds to the length of TS in triangle SRT. Wait, because in triangle WZX, the side WX is between points W and X. In triangle SRT, the corresponding side would be between S and T, which is ST. Therefore, WX corresponds to ST. 

Given that, the problem states that ST = 6. And WX = 5. So that gives us the ratio of similarity between the triangles. 

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their perimeters. So if I can find the scale factor between the triangles, I can use that to compute the perimeter of triangle WZX.

Let me write down the ratio. The ratio of WX to ST is 5/6. Therefore, the scale factor from triangle SRT to triangle WZX is 5/6. Wait, no—wait, which triangle is bigger? If triangle WZX has a side of 5 corresponding to ST of 6, then triangle SRT is larger than triangle WZX? Or vice versa?

Wait, the scale factor depends on which triangle you're comparing. Let me clarify. The ratio of corresponding sides is equal to the scale factor. So if triangle WZX is similar to triangle SRT, then the ratio of WZ/SR = ZX/RT = XW/TS = k, where k is the scale factor. 

In this case, XW corresponds to TS. Given that XW is 5, and TS is 6, so the ratio is 5/6. Therefore, the scale factor from triangle SRT to triangle WZX is 5/6. Which would mean that the perimeter of WZX is (5/6) times the perimeter of SRT. Wait, but hold on. Wait, the perimeter of SRT is given as 15. So if we multiply that by the scale factor, we get the perimeter of WZX. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Suppose triangle ABC ~ triangle DEF with scale factor k. Then each side of ABC is k times the corresponding side of DEF. So the perimeter of ABC is k times the perimeter of DEF. 

Therefore, in our case, since triangle WZX ~ triangle SRT, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is WX / TS = 5 / 6. Therefore, the scale factor from SRT to WZX is 5/6. Hence, the perimeter of WZ X is (5/6)*perimeter of SRT. 

But the perimeter of SRT is 15, so the perimeter of WZX would be (5/6)*15. Let me calculate that: 15 divided by 6 is 2.5, multiplied by 5 is 12.5. So 12.5. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 12.5. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Maybe I mixed up the direction of the scale factor. Let me think again. If triangle WZX is similar to triangle SRT, then the scale factor could be defined as the ratio of WZX to SRT. So if the sides of WZX are smaller than SRT, then the scale factor is less than 1. 

But here, the corresponding sides are WX (in WZX) and TS (in SRT). Since WX is 5 and TS is 6, then the scale factor from SRT to WZX is 5/6. Therefore, the perimeter of WZX is 5/6 * perimeter of SRT. So yes, 15*(5/6)=12.5. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that the scale factor was the other way around, like perimeter of SRT over perimeter of WZX, but that would be incorrect. Let me verify using another approach. 

Suppose we denote the perimeter of triangle SRT as P_SRT = 15. Let’s call the perimeter of triangle WZX as P_WZX. Since they are similar, P_WZX / P_SRT = scale factor. 

But the scale factor is determined by the ratio of corresponding sides. So, since WX corresponds to TS, and WX=5, TS=6, then scale factor is 5/6. Thus, P_WZX = (5/6)*P_SRT = (5/6)*15 = 12.5. 

Yes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 12.5, which is option A. 

Wait, but let me check once more. Is there a possibility that the correspondence of the sides is different? For example, perhaps the labeling of the triangles is different? Let me check the original problem statement again. 

The problem says Triangle(W,Z,X) ~ Triangle(S,R,T). So the order is important. So the first vertex of the first triangle corresponds to the first vertex of the second triangle. So W corresponds to S, Z corresponds to R, X corresponds to T. Therefore, the sides:

WZ corresponds to SR,

ZX corresponds to RT,

XW corresponds to TS.

So, the side opposite W in triangle WZX is ZX, and the side opposite S in triangle SRT is RT. Wait, maybe I need to check the correspondence again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the sides directly. 

For example, in triangle WZX, the sides are WZ, ZX, and XW. In triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, and TS. Therefore, the correspondence is:

WZ ↔ SR,

ZX ↔ RT,

XW ↔ TS.

Thus, the lengths:

WZ / SR = ZX / RT = XW / TS = k.

We know that XW is 5 and TS is 6, so 5/6 = k. Therefore, the scale factor is 5/6. Therefore, the perimeter of WZX is 5/6 times the perimeter of SRT. 

Perimeter of SRT is 15, so perimeter of WZX is 15*(5/6) = 12.5. 

Yes, that matches. Therefore, the answer should be A. 12.5. 

Looking back at the answer choices, A is 12.5, so that's the correct answer. 

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key was correctly identifying the correspondence between the sides based on the order of the vertices in the similarity statement. Once that's clear, the rest follows through calculating the scale factor and applying it to the perimeter. 

Another thing to check: Could there be confusion about which side corresponds to which? For instance, if someone misreads the correspondence, they might pair WX with RT instead of TS. But according to the similarity statement, the order is W-Z-X and S-R-T. Therefore, the third side of each triangle is XW and TS. So that's correct. 

No, I think the logic holds. Therefore, the final answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the perimeter of $\triangle WZX$, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the given similar triangles:

$$
\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT
$$

This tells us that the triangles are **similar**, meaning their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are in proportion. The order of the vertices in the similarity statement determines the correspondence:

- $W$ corresponds to $S$
- $Z$ corresponds to $R$
- $X$ corresponds to $T$

Therefore, the sides of $\triangle WZX$ correspond to the sides of $\triangle SRT$ in the same order:

- Side $WX$ in $\triangle WZX$ corresponds to side $ST$ in $\triangle SRT$
- Side $WZ$ corresponds to $SR$
- Side $ZX$ corresponds to $RT$

---

### Step 1: Use Given Values

From the problem, we are given:

- $WX = 5$
- $ST = 6$
- Perimeter of $\triangle SRT = 15$

Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant across all pairs of sides. Using the known values of $WX$ and $ST$, the **scale factor** (from $\triangle SRT$ to $\triangle WZX$) is:

$$
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}
$$

---

### Step 2: Scale the Perimeter

Since the perimeter of a triangle is proportional to its side lengths, the perimeter of $\triangle WZX$ will also scale by the same factor. Therefore:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle WZX = \text{Scale Factor} \times \text{Perimeter of } \triangle SRT
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle WZX = \frac{5}{6} \times 15 = \frac{75}{6} = 12.5
$$

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
