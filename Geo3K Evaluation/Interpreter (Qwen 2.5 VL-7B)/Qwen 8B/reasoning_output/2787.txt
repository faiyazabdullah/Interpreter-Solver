MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints and see what they imply.

We have a circle labeled B. There's a point B, which might be the center of the circle since there's a mention of arcs and central angles later on. Then there's an arc QS that passes through point B. Wait, but arcs are usually parts of circles. If B is the center, then arc QS would be part of the circle centered at B. But then there are angles mentioned: Angle(QBS, B, S) and Angle(RBS, B, S). Hmm, maybe points Q, R, S are on the circumference of the circle?

Also, it says MeasureOf(Angle(QBS)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(RBS)). So angles QBS and RBS are equal. Then there's an arc QT drawn with center B again? Or is QT another arc? The notation Arc(QT, B) suggests that the arc QT has center B, so that would make sense if B is the center. 

Then there are inscribed angle references: IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)) and similarly for RBS. Also, IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)), meaning that the angle QTS is a central angle related to arc QT. And finally, IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QS, B)), implying that the measure of angle QTS relates to the arc QS.

Wait, the question asks for m∠QTS. So we need to find the measure of angle QTS. Let me try to visualize this. Since B is the center, points Q, S, T, R are likely on the circumference of the circle centered at B.

Let me sketch mentally:

- Circle with center B.
- Points Q, S, R, T on the circumference.
- Arc QS exists, so points Q and S are endpoints of an arc on the circle.
- Angles QBS and RBS are both at point B (the center), so those are central angles. Their measures should be equal, as given. Therefore, the arcs QS and RS (wait, no—angle QBS is formed by points Q, B, S, so the arc between Q and S. Similarly, angle RBS would correspond to arc RS? Wait, no—if angle RBS is also at the center, then the arc between R and S. But since angles QBS and RBS are equal, their corresponding arcs would be congruent. Therefore, arc QS equals arc RS? Wait, but that depends on where R is located. Maybe R is another point such that when you connect BR, the arc from R to S is equal in measure to arc QS?

But then there's an arc QT, which is a central angle. So angle QTS is mentioned as being a central angle over arc QT. Wait, no—the statement says IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)), which means that angle QTS is a central angle corresponding to arc QT. Wait, but angle QTS is at point T. If it's a central angle, then the vertex of the angle should be at the center, but here it's at T. That seems conflicting. Unless there's confusion in notation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle QTS is an inscribed angle? Wait, the problem states that IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)) and similar. Wait, maybe there's some confusion here. Let me go back.

The problem states:

- IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)): This suggests that angle QBS is an inscribed angle. But angle QBS is at point B, which is the center. Inscribed angles are angles whose vertex is on the circumference. So if angle QBS is an inscribed angle, that would mean that point B is on the circumference, but earlier we thought B was the center. Contradiction here. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Let me check again.

Original problem mentions:

- Point(B): So B is a point.
- Arc(QS, B): Arc QS with center B? Or arc QS passing through B? Wait, arc notation usually is Arc(AB, center), but sometimes just Arc(AB) refers to the arc between A and B. However, in some contexts, specifying the center can clarify. For example, Arc(QS, B) could mean the arc QS with center at B, making it a semicircle if Q and S are diametrically opposite. But if B is the center, then arc QS would be part of the circle centered at B.

Similarly, Angle(QBS, B, S): This is probably angle at point B between points Q and S. So angle QBS is a central angle because B is the center. Similarly, angle RBS is another central angle. Given that these two angles are equal, their corresponding arcs are equal. Hence, arc QS equals arc RS? Wait, but angle RBS would be the angle between RB and SB, so the arc from R to S. Therefore, arc QS equals arc RS. So that implies that points Q and R are symmetric with respect to the line BS? Not sure yet.

Additionally, there's an arc QT with center B. So arc QT is another arc on the same circle, centered at B. Then, IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)) — this is confusing. Because angle QBS is a central angle, not an inscribed angle. So maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing? Alternatively, maybe the problem is using non-standard terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps "IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS))" means that angle QBS is an inscribed angle subtended by some arc. But angle QBS is at the center, so that can't be. Maybe there's a mix-up between central and inscribed angles here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says:

"IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS))"

This suggests that angle QBS is an inscribed angle. But angle QBS is at point B, which is supposed to be the center. Therefore, unless point B is on the circumference, but then B cannot be the center. This seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe my initial assumption that B is the center is wrong?

Wait, the first constraint says "Circle(B)", which could mean that B is the center of the circle. Then "Point(B)" refers to the center. Then Arc(QS, B) would be an arc from Q to S with center B, i.e., the arc QS on the circle centered at B. Then angle QBS would be a central angle, as before.

So if angle QBS is a central angle, then its measure is equal to the measure of arc QS. Similarly, angle RBS is another central angle, so its measure equals arc RS. Since they're equal, arc QS = arc RS. Therefore, points Q and R are equidistant from point S along the circle. So maybe QR is symmetrical with respect to BS?

But then there's an arc QT, which is an arc from Q to T with center B. So point T is another point on the circle. Then, IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)) refers to angle QTS being a central angle? But angle QTS is at point T. If it were a central angle, the vertex would be at B, not T. So this seems inconsistent. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's wording, or maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Alternatively, maybe "IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B))" means that the angle QTS is a central angle corresponding to arc QT. Wait, but that still requires the vertex of the angle to be at B. So angle QTS would have to be at point B. But the angle in question is ∠QTS, which is at point T. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps there's a misstatement in the problem. Let me re-examine the original problem's text:

"IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B))" – this might mean that angle QTS is a central angle with respect to arc QT. But if the arc QT has center B, then the central angle would be ∠QBT, not ∠QTS. So there's inconsistency here. Maybe there's a translation error or formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT? Wait, but the problem says IsCentralAngleOf... So that contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT, which would make sense. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose that IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)) means that angle QBS is an inscribed angle subtending some arc. But angle QBS is a central angle. This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between central angles and inscribed angles. Let me recall that an inscribed angle subtends an arc, and its measure is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. So if angle QBS is a central angle, then an inscribed angle subtending the same arc would be half of that. But the problem says that IsInscribedAngleOf(Aangle(QBS)), which may mean that angle QBS is an inscribed angle. Which would only happen if B is on the circumference, not the center. Therefore, this suggests that B is not the center, which conflicts with the initial statement of Circle(B). This contradiction indicates that I need to re-express the problem's assumptions carefully.

Perhaps the problem uses "Circle(B)" to denote that B is a point on the circle, not necessarily the center? Wait, but typically, Circle(B) would refer to a circle with center at B. But if B is a point on the circle, then the radius would be zero, which doesn't make sense. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using non-standard notation, like "Circle(B)" meaning a circle with center at B, and "Point(B)" referring to the center. Then, Arc(QS, B) would be the arc from Q to S on the circle centered at B. So Q and S are points on the circle, and B is the center. Then angles QBS and RBS are central angles. Therefore, their measures are equal to the measures of their respective arcs. So angle QBS equals arc QS, and angle RBS equals arc RS. Since they're equal, arc QS equals arc RS. Thus, points Q and R are positioned such that their distances from S along the circle are equal. So maybe Q and R are symmetric with respect to the line BS?

Now, moving on. There's an arc QT with center B. So arc QT is part of the circle centered at B. Then, IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)) — this seems to suggest that angle QBS is an inscribed angle. But angle QBS is a central angle, so this seems contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing. Perhaps the angle QBS is actually an inscribed angle, which would require that B lies on the circumference. But earlier, B is the center. This is very confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mislabeling. Perhaps the circle isn't centered at B, but rather, point B is on the circle. Let me try that approach. Suppose B is a point on the circle, not the center. Then, the circle has some other center, say O. But the problem says "Circle(B)", which would normally imply that B is the center. This is getting too ambiguous.

Maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that B is the center, even though there are contradictions in the problem's statements. Let me try that.

Assuming B is the center:

- Arc QS is part of the circle centered at B.
- Points Q and S are on the circle.
- Angle QBS is a central angle, so its measure is equal to the measure of arc QS.
- Similarly, angle RBS is a central angle, so its measure is equal to arc RS.
- Since these angles are equal, arc QS = arc RS. So, arc QS and arc RS are equal.
- Then, there's an arc QT, which is also part of the circle centered at B.
- Now, IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)) refers to angle QTS being a central angle. But angle QTS is at point T, so this would require that T is the center. But the center is already B. So this suggests that T is the center, but then T would be the same as B. But the problem refers to point T separately. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT. In that case, the measure of angle QTS would be half the measure of arc QT. But the problem says "IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B))", which would mean that angle QTS is a central angle, which again would require the vertex at B.

This is quite perplexing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's wording. Let me try to focus on what's needed: finding m∠QTS. Let's assume that despite the inconsistencies, there's a way to resolve this.

Let me try to assign variables. Let's suppose that B is the center. Then:

- Arc QS corresponds to angle QBS, which is equal to arc QS. Let's call the measure of arc QS as x degrees. Similarly, since angle RBS equals angle QBS, arc RS is also x degrees. So total arc from Q to S to R would be something.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. Let's imagine points Q, S, R on the circle. Since arc QS = arc RS = x, then point R is such that moving from S, we go x degrees to reach R. Depending on the direction, but assuming it's a standard diagram.

Now, there's an arc QT. Let's assume T is another point on the circle. The problem mentions IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)), which I'll take to mean that angle QTS is a central angle subtending arc QT. But since the center is B, this angle should be at B. So maybe the problem meant that angle QBT is a central angle. But the question is about angle QTS, which is at T. So this is unclear.

Alternatively, if angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT, then its measure would be half of arc QT. But the problem says it's a central angle, which would mean the measure is equal to arc QT. But since the problem also says IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)), perhaps the measure of angle QTS is equal to arc QT. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem has mixed up terms. Let me try to ignore the conflicting parts and focus on what makes sense.

Given that angle QBS equals angle RBS, and both are central angles, so arcs QS and RS are equal. Then, arc QT is mentioned, and angle QTS is related to it. If I can find the measure of arc QT, then depending on whether it's a central or inscribed angle, I can find ∠QTS.

Assume that angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT. Then its measure would be half of arc QT. But if it's a central angle, it would be equal to arc QT. However, without clear info, it's hard to know.

Another piece of information is that IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QS, B)), which might mean that the measure of angle QTS is equal to arc QS. But why would that be? Unless angle QTS is a central angle subtending arc QS. But again, that would require angle QTS to be at the center, which is B, not T.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. Let's think about triangle QTS. If we can find the measures of other angles or arcs, we can use properties of circles and triangles.

Wait, considering that B is the center, and points Q, S, T are on the circle. Let me try to draw this mentally. Assume B is the center. Points Q and S are on the circle, forming arc QS. Point T is another point on the circle. Arc QT is given. Also, there's point R such that arc RS equals arc QS.

If arc QS = arc RS = x, then total arc from Q to S to R is 2x. Depending on the position of R, but assuming it's on the same side.

Now, angle QTS is formed by connecting points Q-T-S. To find its measure, if we can determine the arc it subtends. If angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QS, then its measure would be half of arc QS. But the problem mentions IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QS, B)), suggesting that angle QTS is a central angle, which again is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles QBS and QTS. Since angle QBS is a central angle, and angle QTS is somehow related. For instance, if angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as angle QBS, then it would be half. But angle QBS is a central angle subtending arc QS, so angle QTS would be half of arc QS.

But wait, if angle QTS subtends arc QS, then yes, its measure would be half of arc QS. But how does that relate to the rest of the problem?

But we don't know the measure of arc QS yet. Let's try to express everything in terms of variables.

Let’s denote:

Let arc QS = arc RS = x degrees. Since angle QBS and angle RBS are equal, their measures are x degrees, hence arc QS = arc RS = x.

Now, the circle has 360 degrees. Depending on the positions of Q, R, S, T, etc., we need to find relationships.

Assuming that points Q, S, R are arranged around the circle. For example, starting from Q, going clockwise to S, then continuing to R. But since arc QS = arc RS, then from S, moving another x degrees gets us to R. So the arc from Q to R would be arc QS + arc SR = x + x = 2x.

Now, there's an arc QT. Where is point T? It's mentioned in the arc QT. Assuming arc QT is another arc from Q to T. Let's say that arc QT has measure y degrees. Then, if angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QT, its measure would be y/2. But if it's a central angle, it would be y.

However, the problem states that IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)), which suggests that angle QTS is a central angle, so its measure would be equal to arc QT, which is y. But how do we relate this to other known quantities?

Alternatively, maybe there's more information. The problem also mentions that IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)), which if we take it to mean that angle QBS is an inscribed angle, then its measure would be half the measure of its subtended arc. But angle QBS is at the center, so this would imply that the arc it subtends is twice its measure. But this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points Q, B, S, and T. Let me think.

Since B is the center, QB and BS are radii. So triangle QBS is an isosceles triangle with QB=BS. Similarly for triangle RBS.

But how does this help with angle QTS?

Wait, if I consider triangle QTS, and want to find its measure. Let's assume that angle QTS is an inscribed angle. Let's say it subtends arc QS. Then its measure would be half of arc QS, which is x/2. But we don't know x yet.

Alternatively, if angle QTS subtends arc QT, then it would be y/2. But how do we find y?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc QT and other arcs. For example, if arc QT is related to arcs QS and RS.

But without knowing the exact placement of T, it's challenging. Let me try to consider possible configurations.

Suppose that arc QT is such that T is positioned such that when connected to S, forms angle QTS. Let's assume that arc QT is supplementary to arc QS or something like that.

Alternatively, since arc QS = x, and arc RS = x, then the remaining arc from R to Q would be 360 - 2x, assuming the circle is divided into these arcs. But without knowing where T is, this is speculative.

Wait, maybe there's a property related to the fact that angle QTS is a central angle. If that's the case, then angle QTS would be equal to the measure of arc QT. But since the center is B, angle QTS at T can't be a central angle unless T is the center. So this suggests that T is B, but then T=B, which might conflict with other points.

This is really confusing. Let me try to look for alternative approaches.

Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle QBS is a central angle, then it equals arc QS. If there's an inscribed angle subtending the same arc QS, its measure would be half of that.

But the problem mentions that IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS)), which might mean that angle QBS is an inscribed angle. But that would require that B is on the circumference. So let's explore that scenario.

Assume that B is a point on the circumference, not the center. Then, the circle has some other center, say O. But the problem says "Circle(B)", which typically denotes the center is B. But if B is on the circumference, then the circle would have to have a different center. This is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has errors in its wording, and "IsInscribedAngleOf(Angle(QBS))" is supposed to mean that angle QBS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QR or something else. Without clarity, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradictions, perhaps I should try to make educated guesses based on common problems.

Common problems involve central angles and inscribed angles. Let's assume that angle QBS and angle RBS are central angles, so their measures are equal to arcs QS and RS respectively. Since they're equal, arcs QS and RS are equal. Let's say each is x degrees. Then, the arc from Q to R via S is 2x.

Now, arc QT is mentioned. Suppose that arc QT is equal to arc QS + arc ST, or something like that. But without knowing where T is, it's hard to say.

But the question is asking for m∠QTS. If we assume that angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QS, then it would be x/2. But if it's a central angle, it would be x. But how do we find x?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arcs QT and QS. Let me think about the full circle. Total degrees = 360.

If arc QS = arc RS = x, then arc QR = 2x. Let's assume that the rest of the circle is composed of other arcs. But without knowing where T is, this is difficult.

Wait, the problem also mentions IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QS, B)). This might mean that angle QTS is a central angle subtending arc QS. But again, that would mean the angle is at B, not T. So this suggests that maybe angle QTS is equal to arc QS, but since it's at T, this is impossible unless T is B.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the notation. Maybe IsCentralAngleOf(Arc(QT, B)) means that arc QT is a central angle, which it is, since B is the center. But the measure of arc QT is equal to the central angle subtending it, which is angle QBT, not angle QTS.

At this point, I realize I might be stuck due to ambiguities in the problem's phrasing. Let me try to look for another angle.

The answer choices are numerical values: 109, 212, 248, 254. These numbers are close to multiples of 180 or 90, suggesting possible relationships with straight lines or inscribed angles.

If I assume that angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending an arc that is 212 degrees, then its measure would be 106 degrees, which isn't among the choices. Alternatively, if it subtends an arc of 254 degrees, then the angle would be 127 degrees. Still not matching.

Wait, but maybe the measure is related to reflex angles. For example, if the arc is greater than 180 degrees, the inscribed angle would still be half of the arc. But if the arc is reflex, the measure of the inscribed angle would be half of the reflex arc, which could be more than 180.

Wait, but the measure of an inscribed angle is always less than 180 degrees, because it's half the measure of its intercepted arc. If the arc is reflex (greater than 180), then the inscribed angle would be half of that, which would be greater than 90 degrees but less than 180. But none of the answer choices are in this range except maybe 109, 212, 248, 254. Wait, 212 and 248 are greater than 180, which can't be the measure of an inscribed angle. So this suggests that the angle QTS is a central angle, and thus its measure equals the arc it subtends. But if the arc is reflex, then the measure of the central angle would be the reflex arc, which could be one of the answer choices.

For example, if arc QT is 212 degrees, then the central angle would be 212 degrees, which would be the measure of angle QTS if it's a central angle. But how does this fit with other constraints?

Let me try to work backwards. Suppose that angle QTS is a central angle subtending arc QT, which has measure 212 degrees. Then m∠QTS = 212. This matches option B. But how do we justify this?

To get there, we need to show that arc QT is 212 degrees. Let's see if that's possible.

Assuming arc QS = arc RS = x, and other arcs sum to 360. Let's say arc QT is 212, then the rest of the circle is 360 - 212 = 148 degrees. But without knowing the relation between arc QT and other arcs, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, if angle QTS is an inscribed angle subtending arc QS, and if arc QS is 212 degrees, then the angle would be 106, not matching. If arc QT is 254, then the angle would be 127, still not matching.

Wait, but if arc QT is a reflex arc, then the central angle would be the reflex measure. For example, if the arc QT is 212 degrees, then the central angle is 212, which could be the answer. But how to derive that?

Let me think about the entire circle. Suppose that arc QS = arc RS = x. Let's assume that arc QT is some value. If there's a relationship between these arcs.

Alternatively, since angle QBS and angle RBS are equal, and both are central angles, then arc QS = arc RS = x. Let's assume that points Q, S, R are placed such that arc QS = arc RS = x. Then, the arc from Q to R passing through S is 2x.

Now, arc QT is another arc. Let's say that arc QT is made up of arc QS plus arc ST, so arc QT = x + arc ST. But without knowing where T is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if T is placed such that arc QT is equal to arc QR. If arc QR is 2x, then arc QT would be 2x, making angle QTS (if it's a central angle) equal to 2x. But we need to relate this to other information.

But without additional constraints, it's impossible to determine the exact measure. Given the lack of clarity, perhaps the answer is derived from assuming that the central angle QTS subtends an arc that is 212 degrees, leading to choice B.

Alternatively, if arc QS is 106 degrees (since angle QBS is a central angle equal to arc QS, and if there's an inscribed angle subtending it, it would be 53, but this is speculative).

Given the answer choices, and common problems, I think the most plausible answer is B. 212. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the measure is 254, which is 360 - 106, but again, this is guessing.

Alternatively, if arc QT is 212 degrees, then the central angle is 212, which is answer B. I'll go with B.
