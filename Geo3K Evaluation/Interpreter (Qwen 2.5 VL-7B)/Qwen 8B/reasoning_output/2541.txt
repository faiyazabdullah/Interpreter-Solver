MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral ABCD. The problem says there are right angles at angles B and C. Also, it mentions that the measure of angle A is equal to the measure of angle D, and they want us to find the measure of angle A. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. That's a key point here. So, if I can express the measures of all four angles in terms of variables, maybe I can set up an equation and solve for the unknowns.

The problem states that angles B and C are right angles. Right angles are 90 degrees each. So, angle B = 90° and angle C = 90°. Now, angles A and D are mentioned as being equal. Let me denote the measure of angle A as x. Then, since angle D is equal to angle A, angle D is also x. 

So, adding up all the angles: angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360°. Substituting the known values:

x (for A) + 90° (for B) + 90° (for C) + x (for D) = 360°.

Combining like terms: 2x + 180° = 360°. Subtracting 180° from both sides gives 2x = 180°, so dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 90°. Wait, but that would mean angles A and D are each 90°, making all four angles 90°, which would make the quadrilateral a rectangle. But wait, rectangles have all angles as right angles, so that's possible. However, the answer choices include 90° as option B. But let me check again because sometimes there might be something missing here.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)" and specifies that angles B and C are right angles. So, if angles B and C are each 90°, then angles A and D add up to 360 - 180 = 180°, so each of them is 90°, as above. But that would make the quadrilateral a rectangle. However, rectangles are parallelograms with all angles 90°, so that seems okay. But maybe there's another possibility? Like, could the quadrilateral be a different shape?

Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral isn't convex? Wait, but even if it's concave, the sum of the interior angles still has to be 360°. So regardless of whether it's convex or concave, angles B and C are right angles. If angles A and D are both 90°, then yes, that adds up. But maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement?

Let me re-examine the problem statement carefully. It says:

"Plus(Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(D)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
MeasureOf(Angle(D)"

Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. Maybe the original problem was written in some formal notation, and the user translated it into text. Let me parse it again. The problem says:

"Plus(Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(D)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
MeasureOf(Angle(D))"

Wait, that seems like a translation error or formatting issue. Maybe it's supposed to say that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(D)), and that Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A))...? Or perhaps it's saying that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) plus MeasureOf(Angle(D))? Wait, the original wording says:

"Plus(Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(D)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
MeasureOf(Angle(D))"

This is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the measure of angle A is equal to the measure of angle D, and that the measure of angle A plus the measure of angle D equals something? Or perhaps there's a typo in the way it's presented. Given the context, the most plausible interpretation is that angles A and D are equal. Because otherwise, the problem might not make sense. For example, if it said that angle A plus angle D equals something else, but given that angles B and C are already fixed, maybe that's the case.

But assuming that the problem intended to state that angle A is equal to angle D, then my previous calculation holds. Therefore, angles A and D are each 90°, leading to all angles being right angles. Hence, the answer would be 90°, which is option B. However, let me think again—are there other possibilities?

Wait, suppose that the quadrilateral is not a rectangle. Suppose that angles B and C are right angles, but angles A and D are not necessarily 90°, but their measures are equal. Then, the total sum would be:

A + B + C + D = 360°

Since B and C are 90°, then A + D = 360 - 90 - 90 = 180°. Since A = D, then each is 90°, so same conclusion. So regardless, angles A and D must each be 90°, making the quadrilateral a rectangle. Therefore, the measure of angle A is 90°, so answer B.

But wait, why is there an option for 135° or 45°? Could there be a scenario where angles A and D are not 90°? For instance, if the quadrilateral is not convex? Let me consider a concave quadrilateral. Suppose angle B and C are still right angles, but angle A is reflex (greater than 180°), but then angle D would have to compensate. However, if angles A and D are equal, then if angle A is greater than 180°, angle D would also be greater than 180°, but then the sum of angles would be more than 360°, which is impossible. Therefore, angles A and D cannot be reflex. So they must be less than 180°, hence each must be 90°, as before.

Therefore, the only solution is that angles A and D are each 90°, making the answer B. But wait, let me check once more. What if the quadrilateral is a trapezoid? For example, a right trapezoid has two right angles. But in that case, only two angles are right angles. However, the problem states that angles B and C are right angles. So if it's a trapezoid, then angles A and D would be supplementary if it's a right trapezoid. Wait, but in that case, angles A and D would add up to 180°, but since they are equal, each would be 90°, which again brings us back to a rectangle. So no difference.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to a different type of quadrilateral. But regardless of the specific type, the sum of the angles is fixed. Thus, with angles B and C being right angles, and angles A and D equal, the only possible value is 90°. Therefore, answer B.

But let me double-check the problem statement again. The original question says:

"Plus(Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(D)
Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
MeasureOf(Angle(D))"

Maybe this is a misformatting, and the actual meaning is that MeasureOf(Angle(A)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(D)). Which would make sense. So that angle A equals angle D. Therefore, the earlier reasoning applies.

Hence, the measure of angle A is 90°, so answer B. But wait, looking at the answer choices, option B is 90°, so that's the answer. However, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify with equations again.

Sum of angles: A + B + C + D = 360°.

Given that B = 90°, C = 90°, A = D. So substituting:

A + 90 + 90 + A = 360 → 2A + 180 = 360 → 2A = 180 → A = 90°. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be B. But why does the problem mention "Plus(Equal(...))"? Maybe there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the problem says that the measure of angle A plus the measure of angle D equals something? But according to the original text, it's unclear. However, based on standard problems, it's likely that angles A and D are equal, leading to 90°. Therefore, I'll go with B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle A$ in quadrilateral $ABCD$, we start by analyzing the geometric constraints and applying fundamental principles of polygon angle sums.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are told:

- $\angle B$ and $\angle C$ are right angles ($90^\circ$).
- $\angle A = \angle D$

These imply that the quadrilateral has two right angles at vertices $B$ and $C$, and the remaining two angles, at vertices $A$ and $D$, are equal.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Angle Sum Property of Quadrilaterals**

The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always:

$$
\text{Sum} = 360^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values into the formula:

$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
$$

$$
\angle A + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + \angle D = 360^\circ
$$

Since $\angle A = \angle D$, let’s call their common measure $x$. Then the equation becomes:

$$
x + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x = 360^\circ
$$

$$
2x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
$$

$$
2x = 180^\circ
$$

$$
x = 90^\circ
$$

Thus, $\angle A = 90^\circ$

---

### **Conclusion**

All angles in the quadrilateral are right angles, which means the quadrilateral is a rectangle (or possibly a square). This satisfies the conditions given in the problem.

**Final Answer: B**  
$\boxed{\text{B}}$
