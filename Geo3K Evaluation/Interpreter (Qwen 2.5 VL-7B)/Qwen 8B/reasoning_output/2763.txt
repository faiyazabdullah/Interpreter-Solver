====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked.

We have a rhombus ABCD. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So that's important. 

The points mentioned are A, B, C, D, and E. The lines given are AB, BC, CD, DA (the sides of the rhombus), AC and BD (the diagonals). Then there are some angles mentioned: angle ABC, angle BCD, angle ACD, and angle CDE. Wait, angle CDE is given as 116 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle ACD.

Wait, but first, let me confirm the diagram. Let me sketch mentally the rhombus ABCD. Let me recall that in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees. But also, each diagonal bisects the angles at the vertices. For example, diagonal AC will split angle A and angle C into two equal parts. Similarly for diagonal BD splitting angles B and D.

Now, the problem mentions that line AC is a diagonal, so that's one diagonal. Also, it says that diagonal AC is bisected by... wait, no, the problem states:

"IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(A,C) IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(B,D))"

Wait, maybe that's saying that diagonal AC is bisected by something? Or perhaps that both diagonals are bisectors of each other? Wait, the exact wording is:

"IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(A,C) IsBisOtherOf(Diagonal(B,D))"

Hmm, maybe the original statement was that Diagonal AC is bisected by Diagonal BD, which is standard in a rhombus because the diagonals bisect each other. So in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning they intersect at their midpoints. Therefore, each diagonal is bisected by the other. So that part is just confirming the properties of a rhombus.

But then there's point E. The angle CDE is given as 116 degrees. So point E must lie somewhere such that when you connect D to E, forming angle CDE. Since the original figure is a rhombus ABCD, point E might be on one of the sides or extended lines? Hmm. Let me think.

Let me try to visualize. Let me consider the rhombus ABCD with points labeled in order. Let me imagine it as follows: A at top left, B at top right, C at bottom right, D at bottom left. Then the diagonals are AC (from A to C) and BD (from B to D). These cross at the center O. Now, point E is connected via line DE, creating angle CDE. So point E is probably along the extension of some side or another line. But how?

Since angle CDE is formed at point D, between points C, D, and E. So point E is such that when connected to D, forms angle CDE. Given that angle CDE is 116 degrees. Need to relate this to angle ACD.

First, let's note that angle ACD is one of the angles formed by diagonal AC and side CD. Because in rhombus ABCD, diagonal AC splits angle C into two equal parts. So angle ACD would be half of angle C of the rhombus.

So if I can find angle C of the rhombus, then divide by 2 to get angle ACD. Alternatively, maybe use other relationships involving angle CDE.

Alternatively, since angle CDE is given, perhaps triangle CDE has some relationship with other elements.

But first, let me recall that in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle C and angle D are supplementary. Wait, but angle C is at point C, and angle D is at point D. Wait, in a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ABC + angle BCD = 180°, etc.

But let me focus on angle CDE. Point E is connected to D and E. Since E isn't defined yet, but the problem gives angle CDE as 116°, which is an external angle? Maybe E lies on an extension of a side?

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other, maybe E is related to the intersection of diagonals? Wait, but diagonals intersect at O, the midpoint. However, angle CDE involves point E. So unless E is another point on the plane.

Wait, perhaps E is the intersection point of diagonal BD and some other line? Or maybe E is on the extension of BD beyond D? Let me think.

Alternatively, since angle CDE is given, maybe triangle CDE is formed with E lying on some specific location. Let me think about possible configurations.

Another approach: Let's consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to the rhombus to calculate the angles. Let me place the rhombus in coordinate system for simplicity.

Let me assume that the rhombus is centered at origin. Let me assign coordinates. Suppose diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Let me suppose that diagonal AC is horizontal, and BD vertical. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s say diagonal AC has length 2a, so points A(-a, 0) and C(a, 0). Diagonal BD has length 2b, so points B(0, b) and D(0, -b). Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So yes, that setup works.

But in reality, the diagonals aren't necessarily aligned with axes unless specified. Anyway, using coordinates may help compute angles.

But maybe there's a better way without coordinates.

Let me think again about angle CDE. Since angle CDE is 116°, which is given. Let me see: At point D, we have angle ADC of the rhombus. Wait, in the rhombus, angle ADC is one of the angles. Since adjacent angles are supplementary, angle ADC and angle DAB are supplementary. But how does angle CDE come into play?

If E is a point such that DE is extending from D, making angle CDE. Maybe E is on the extension of DC or DB?

Wait, if I consider angle CDE, then points C, D, E form an angle at D. So E could be anywhere such that when connected to D, creates that angle. Without more info, perhaps we need to infer based on the given conditions.

But the problem also mentions that diagonal AC is bisected by diagonal BD, which is already true in a rhombus. But maybe there's more to it. Wait, the problem says "IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(A,C) IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(B,D)" — maybe that's redundant, since in a rhombus diagonals bisect each other, so each diagonal is bisected by the other. So that condition holds automatically.

But maybe the key here is that the diagonals are angle bisectors. Since in a rhombus, diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal AC bisects angle A and angle C, and diagonal BD bisects angles B and D.

Therefore, angle ACD is half of angle C of the rhombus. Let me denote angle C as θ. Then angle ACD = θ/2.

Similarly, angle ADC is angle at D, which in the rhombus is supplementary to angle C. So angle ADC = 180° - θ.

Now, considering angle CDE = 116°, which is at point D. So angle between DC and DE is 116°. Let me try to relate this to other angles.

Assuming that E lies on some line. Let me think: If E is on the extension of BD beyond D, then DE would be along BD extended. But BD is a diagonal from B to D. If E is on the extension of BD beyond D, then DE would be colinear with BD. But angle CDE would then be between DC and DE. Let me think.

In that case, angle between DC and BD. Wait, BD is a diagonal. In the rhombus, BD connects B to D. At point D, the sides are DC and DA. The diagonal BD goes from B to D, so at point D, BD is going towards B. So angle between DC and BD at D would be angle between DC and BD. Which is part of angle ADC.

Wait, angle ADC is composed of angle between DC and DA. But BD is a diagonal, so angle between DC and BD would depend on the rhombus angles.

Alternatively, maybe E is located such that DE is parallel to something? Or maybe E is the intersection of some lines?

Alternatively, since angle CDE is given, and we need to relate it to angle ACD. Let me try to find relations.

Let me consider triangle CDE. We know angle at D is 116°, and maybe other angles or sides can be determined.

But without knowing more about E, it's hard. Perhaps E is the intersection of diagonal BD with something else?

Wait, maybe E is the intersection point of diagonal BD with another line? Wait, but BD is already a diagonal. Unless E is the same as B or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is on the extension of DC beyond C? Not sure. Wait, but then angle CDE would involve different things.

Alternatively, maybe E is the reflection of a point over diagonal AC or BD?

Alternatively, since diagonals bisect each other, maybe E is the midpoint of some segment?

This is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.

Given that angle CDE = 116°, and we need to find angle ACD.

Let me consider the properties of the rhombus again. Let me denote:

- All sides equal: AB=BC=CD=DA.

- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, the midpoint.

- Diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees.

- Each diagonal bisects the angles at the vertices.

So, angle ACD is half of angle C of the rhombus. Let me call angle C as θ. Then angle ACD = θ / 2.

Also, angle ADC is 180° - θ, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary.

At point D, angle ADC is made up of angle between DC and DA. The diagonal BD divides angle ADC into two angles. Wait, because diagonal BD bisects angle D. So angle ADC is split into two equal parts by diagonal BD. Therefore, each of those angles is (180° - θ)/2.

But how does angle CDE fit in?

Suppose E is a point such that DE is along the direction of BD extended. So if I extend BD beyond D to point E, then DE is along BD. Then, angle CDE would be the angle between DC and DE (which is BD extended).

So, in that case, angle CDE is the angle between DC and BD extended beyond D. That angle would be equal to half of angle ADC, or something else?

Wait, angle between DC and BD. Let me think. At point D, the sides are DC and DA. The diagonal BD comes from B to D. So, BD splits angle ADC into two equal angles. So angle between DC and BD is equal to angle between BD and DA, each being (180° - θ)/2.

But if E is on the extension of BD beyond D, then angle CDE is the angle between DC and DE, which is the same as angle between DC and BD, which is (180° - θ)/2. Wait, but that would mean angle CDE equals (180° - θ)/2. And according to the problem, angle CDE is 116°, so:

(180° - θ)/2 = 116° => 180° - θ = 232° => θ = 180° - 232° = -52°, which is impossible. So that suggests my assumption about the position of E is wrong.

Alternative possibility: E is not on BD extended, but somewhere else. Maybe E is on AD extended?

Or perhaps E is on AB extended? Let me think differently.

Alternatively, maybe E is such that DE is parallel to some side or diagonal. For instance, if DE is parallel to AB, then angle CDE could be related to other angles.

Alternatively, since angle CDE is given, and we need to relate it to angle ACD, which is half of angle C.

Let me think about the sum of angles around point D. At point D, we have angle ADC (which is 180° - θ), and also angle CDE = 116°. Depending on where E is, these angles might add up or subtract.

If E is inside the rhombus, then angle CDE might be part of angle ADC. But since angle CDE is larger than 90°, maybe E is outside the rhombus.

For example, suppose E is on the extension of DC beyond C. Then, angle CDE would be an exterior angle. Let me consider that scenario.

If E is on extension of DC beyond C, then angle CDE is formed between DC and DE. Let me imagine extending DC past C to E. Then, angle CDE would be a straight line minus some angle. Wait, but angle CDE would be between DC and DE. If E is on DC extended, then DE would be a straight line, making angle CDE 180°, which doesn't match 116°. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if E is on the extension of CB beyond B? No, that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe E is on the extension of DA beyond A? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps E is such that DE is parallel to AB. Let me explore that.

If DE is parallel to AB, then angle CDE could be equal to angle DAB, since they are corresponding angles. But angle DAB is equal to angle BCD, which is θ (since opposite angles in rhombus are equal). Wait, angle DAB is equal to angle BCD. Wait, no: in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So angle A = angle C, angle B = angle D. Adjacent angles are supplementary.

So angle DAB is equal to angle BCD. Let me denote angle DAB as φ. Then angle ABC = 180° - φ, angle BCD = φ, angle ADC = 180° - φ. Wait, but earlier I had angle C as θ. Let me clarify variables.

Let me define angle at C as θ. Then angle at D is 180° - θ. Since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary.

So angle ADC = 180° - θ. At point D, angle between DC and DA is 180° - θ. If DE is drawn such that angle CDE is 116°, which is given.

If DE is such that it makes angle CDE = 116°, then depending on where E is, we can relate this to other angles.

Let me consider that DE is forming an angle with DC. Let me suppose that E is located such that DE is making an angle of 116° with DC, which is the side DC.

So, if I consider triangle CDE, with DC as one side, DE as another, and CE as the third side. To find relations, maybe using triangle properties.

Alternatively, since we know angle CDE = 116°, and trying to relate it to other angles in the rhombus.

Wait, if I consider that in rhombus ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. Then, BO and OD are halves of BD. Also, AO and OC are halves of AC.

But how does E factor in?

Alternatively, maybe E is the intersection of diagonal BD with the extension of AC? Wait, but diagonals intersect at O, which is the midpoint. So E might be a different point.

Alternatively, maybe E is the midpoint of DC? But then angle CDE would be zero or undefined.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions "IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(A,C) IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(B,D)", which might imply that the diagonals bisect each other, which is inherent in a rhombus, so that condition is satisfied.

Perhaps there's a property I'm missing. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, for example, diagonal AC splits angle C into two equal parts, so angle ACD = angle ACD (wait, that's trivial). Wait, angle at C is split into two angles by diagonal AC. So angle ACB and angle ACD. Wait, no, angle at C is angle BCD. Diagonal AC splits angle C into two angles: angle ACB and angle ACD? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

At point C, the angles are between BC and CD. The diagonal AC connects to point A. So diagonal AC splits angle at C into two angles: angle ACB and angle ACD? Wait, no. Wait, point C is connected to B and D. Diagonal AC connects C to A. So at point C, the angle between BC and CD is angle BCD. When we draw diagonal AC, it splits angle BCD into two angles: angle BCA and angle ACD. Yes. So angle BCD is split into angle BCA and angle ACD by diagonal AC. Since diagonals bisect angles, these two angles are equal. So angle BCA = angle ACD = (angle BCD)/2.

Thus, angle ACD = (angle BCD)/2. And since angle BCD is equal to angle BAD (opposite angles in rhombus), but also, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle BCD + angle ADC = 180°, and angle ADC = 180° - angle BCD.

But how does angle CDE come into play? Let me try to link angle CDE with other angles.

If I can express angle CDE in terms of angle BCD or other angles, then I can set up an equation.

Assume that point E is located such that DE is forming angle CDE = 116°. Let me consider that DE is extending from D in some direction. Let me think about the possibility that E is on the extension of BD.

Earlier, I thought that if E is on the extension of BD beyond D, then angle CDE would be equal to angle between DC and BD. Let me recalculate that.

At point D, the diagonal BD goes from D to B. So, if I extend BD beyond D to E, then DE is a continuation of BD. So, angle CDE is the angle between DC and DE (which is BD extended). This angle would be equal to angle between DC and BD. 

What is that angle? Let me think. At point D, the sides are DC and DA. The diagonal BD splits angle ADC into two equal parts. So angle between DC and BD is equal to angle between BD and DA, each being (angle ADC)/2. Angle ADC is 180° - angle BCD. So angle between DC and BD is (180° - angle BCD)/2.

But angle CDE is equal to this value, assuming E is on the extension of BD beyond D. Thus:

angle CDE = (180° - angle BCD)/2 = 116°

So:

(180° - angle BCD)/2 = 116°  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
180° - angle BCD = 232°  
Then angle BCD = 180° - 232° = -52°

That's impossible, since angles can't be negative. Hence, my assumption about the position of E must be incorrect.

So maybe E is not on the extension of BD. Let me try another possibility. What if E is on the extension of DC beyond C? Then, angle CDE would be an exterior angle at D. Let me think.

If E is on the extension of DC beyond C, then DE is a straight line passing through C. So angle CDE would be 180°, which contradicts the given 116°. So that's not possible.

What if E is somewhere else? Maybe E is on the extension of DA beyond A? Let me visualize.

If I extend DA beyond A to E, then angle CDE would be the angle between DC and DE. Let me consider triangle CDE.

Alternatively, maybe E is on the side AB or BC? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe E is a point such that DE is parallel to AC. Let me try that. If DE is parallel to AC, then angle CDE would be equal to angle between DC and AC. Wait, since DE || AC, then angle between DC and DE would be equal to angle between DC and AC, due to parallel lines.

But AC is a diagonal. At point C, angle between DC and AC is angle ACD, which is half of angle BCD. So if DE || AC, then angle CDE = angle ACD. But angle CDE is given as 116°, so angle ACD would be 116°, but that's option C. But let me check if this reasoning holds.

Wait, if DE is parallel to AC, then angle CDE would correspond to angle between DC and DE, which is equal to angle between DC and AC, because of the parallel lines. So angle CDE = angle ACD. Hence, angle ACD = 116°, which would make answer C. But let me verify if DE is indeed parallel to AC.

But why would DE be parallel to AC? There's no direct information given about E's position, except angle CDE = 116°. So this is an assumption. But maybe the problem implies that DE is parallel to AC? Or is there another reason?

Alternatively, since diagonals bisect each other, maybe there's some relation. Alternatively, since diagonals are angle bisectors, maybe there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is the intersection of diagonal BD with something else. Wait, but diagonals intersect at O. If E is O, then angle CDE would be the angle between DC and DO. Let me compute that.

At point D, diagonal BD goes to O. So angle between DC and DO. Since diagonals intersect at O, which is the midpoint. Let me consider the angle between DC and DO.

In a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. So angle between DC and BD is 90°? No, only if the rhombus is a square. Wait, in general, diagonals are perpendicular in a rhombus, but they aren't necessarily at 90° with the sides. Wait, no, in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. So the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

So at point D, the diagonal BD is perpendicular to AC. Wait, no, diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So at the point where they intersect, they form right angles. But at point D itself, the angle between DC and BD depends on the angles of the rhombus.

Wait, let me think again. At point D, the sides are DC and DA. The diagonal BD connects D to B. The diagonal AC connects A to C. At point D, the angle between DC and BD is not necessarily 90°, unless the rhombus is a square.

But since diagonals are perpendicular, the angle between AC and BD is 90°, but at individual points like D, the angle between DC and BD is different.

So, back to angle CDE. If E is O (intersection point of diagonals), then angle CDE would be the angle between DC and DO. Let me try calculating this.

Let me consider triangle DOC. In rhombus ABCD, diagonals intersect at O. So OD is half of BD, and OC is half of AC. Since diagonals are perpendicular, angle COD is 90°. But angle at D, between DC and DO.

Wait, in triangle DOC, angle at D is between DC and DO. Let me find that angle.

In rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So angle between DC and diagonal BD is equal to half of angle ADC.

Wait, earlier we said that angle ADC is 180° - θ, where θ is angle BCD. And since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, the angle between DC and BD is (180° - θ)/2. So if E is point O, then angle CDE is equal to (180° - θ)/2.

But we don't know θ yet. But angle CDE is given as 116°, so:

(180° - θ)/2 = 116°  
=> 180° - θ = 232°  
=> θ = 180° - 232° = -52°, again impossible.

So this suggests that E cannot be point O. Hence, my assumption about E's location is still incorrect.

Maybe E is on the extension of diagonal AC? Let me think. If I extend AC beyond C to E, then angle CDE would be between DC and DE. Let me try to find this angle.

If E is on extension of AC beyond C, then DE connects D to E. Let me try to find angle CDE.

But without knowing the exact location of E, this is challenging. Maybe there's another approach.

Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle ACD is half of angle C. Let me denote angle C as x, so angle ACD = x/2.

Also, since angle CDE = 116°, and angle CDE is related to other angles.

If I can find x, then angle ACD is x/2.

To find x, maybe using the fact that angle CDE = 116° relates to x.

Let me consider triangle CDE. Let me assume that DE is a certain line, and use triangle properties.

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's difficult. Let me think if there's another property.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals divide it into four congruent right triangles. Each triangle has legs equal to half the lengths of the diagonals.

But how does this help with angle CDE?

Alternatively, maybe using the law of sines or cosines in triangle CDE.

But I need more information about the sides or other angles. Let me think.

Alternatively, since angle CDE is given, and we want to relate it to angle ACD, maybe using the fact that angle CDE is an external angle to some triangle.

Wait, if I consider triangle CDE, angle at D is 116°, and if I can find other angles or sides...

Wait, but without more info, this seems stuck. Let me go back.

Maybe I missed a crucial piece of information: the problem says "IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(A,C) IsBisectorOf(Diagonal(B,D)". This might mean that diagonal AC is bisected by diagonal BD, which is always true in a rhombus. But maybe there's more? Or perhaps it means that diagonal AC is bisected by diagonal BD, and vice versa, which is standard.

But perhaps the key is that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, hence forming right angles at their intersection.

Wait, but how does that help with angle CDE?

Let me think about the entire picture. Let me try to assign variables.

Let me denote angle CDE = 116°, and I need to find angle ACD. Let me denote angle ACD as y. Our goal is to find y.

From earlier, angle ACD = x/2, where x is angle at C.

Also, in the rhombus, angle at D is 180° - x.

Now, angle CDE is formed at D, between DC and DE. Let me assume that DE is such that it creates angle CDE = 116°, and try to relate this to x.

If I can find a relationship between angle CDE and x, I can solve for x and thus find y.

Let me think about the possible configuration where angle CDE = 116°. Let me consider that DE is the extension of diagonal BD. Earlier, this led to a contradiction, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Let me re-examine that. Assume E is on the extension of BD beyond D. Then, DE is along BD extended. At point D, the angle between DC and DE (which is BD extended) would be equal to the angle between DC and BD.

As before, this angle is equal to (180° - x)/2, since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC (which is 180° - x). So:

(180° - x)/2 = 116°  
180° - x = 232°  
x = 180° - 232° = -52°, which is impossible.

This suggests that this configuration is invalid. Hence, E is not on the extension of BD.

Another idea: Maybe E is on the extension of DC such that DE is forming a certain angle. Let me try.

If E is on the extension of DC beyond C, then DE is a straight line, and angle CDE would be 180°, which is not possible. So no.

If E is on the extension of DA beyond A, then DE would form some angle. Let me try to imagine.

At point D, DA goes to A. Extending DA beyond A to E. Then, angle CDE would be the angle between DC and DE. Let me try to find this angle.

In this case, DE is extending from D through A to E. So, angle between DC and DE would be angle between DC and DA extended. But DA is a side of the rhombus. At point D, angle between DC and DA is angle ADC = 180° - x. So if DE is extending DA, then angle CDE would be 180° - x. But this would mean that angle CDE = 180° - x = 116°, so x = 180° - 116° = 64°, making angle ACD = x/2 = 32°, which is not among the options. Hence, this is likely incorrect.

Wait, but the options are A. 58, B. 90, C. 116, D. 180. So 32° is not there. So this suggests another error.

Alternatively, if E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then DE would be a straight line from D in the direction opposite to A. So angle CDE would be between DC and DE, which is angle between DC and DA extended. At point D, angle between DC and DA is angle ADC = 180° - x. If DE is in the opposite direction of DA, then angle CDE would be 180° - (180° - x) = x. So angle CDE = x = 116°, so x = 116°, making angle ACD = x/2 = 58°, which is option A. This seems promising!

Let me verify this. If E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then DE is a line starting at D and going in the opposite direction of DA. So, at point D, the angle between DC and DE would be supplementary to angle ADC. Let me explain:

Original angle at D between DC and DA is angle ADC = 180° - x. If DE is extending DA beyond D, then DE is forming a straight line with DA, but extending away from A. So, the angle between DC and DE would be 180° minus angle ADC. Wait, let me visualize.

At point D, DA extends to A, and DE extends in the opposite direction. So, the angle between DC and DE would be equal to 180° - angle ADC. Because angle ADC is between DC and DA, and DE is in the direction opposite to DA, so the angle between DC and DE is 180° - angle ADC.

So:

angle CDE = 180° - angle ADC = 180° - (180° - x) = x.

Given angle CDE = 116°, so x = 116°, which is angle at C. Hence, angle ACD = x/2 = 116° / 2 = 58°, which is option A.

Yes! This makes sense. So the assumption is that E is on the extension of DA beyond D, making angle CDE = x = 116°, leading to angle ACD = 58°.

Let me double-check this logic.

If E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then DE is a straight line from D through A extended. Wait, no: if E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then DE starts at D and goes in the direction opposite to A. So, DA goes from D to A; extending beyond D would be going away from A. So, DE is going from D in the direction opposite to A.

At point D, the angle between DC and DA is angle ADC = 180° - x. The angle between DC and DE (which is in the opposite direction of DA) would be 180° - angle ADC. Because if you have two lines: DC and DA, forming angle ADC. If you extend DA beyond D to E, then the angle between DC and DE would be 180° - angle ADC.

Wait, let me think of it as supplementary. Imagine standing at point D, facing DA. Turning towards DC, you turn through angle ADC. If you instead face the opposite direction of DA (towards E), then the angle between DC and DE would be supplementary to angle ADC. Hence, angle CDE = 180° - angle ADC = 180° - (180° - x) = x.

Yes! So angle CDE = x = 116°, hence x = 116°, and angle ACD = x/2 = 58°, which matches option A.

This seems to fit. So the correct answer should be A. 58°.

Let me check if there are any inconsistencies. If x = 116°, then angle at C is 116°, angle at D is 180° - 116° = 64°. Then, in the rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at D is 64°, angle at C is 116°, which fits.

Then, angle ACD = 116° / 2 = 58°, which is the desired value. So this makes sense.

Hence, the correct answer is A.
