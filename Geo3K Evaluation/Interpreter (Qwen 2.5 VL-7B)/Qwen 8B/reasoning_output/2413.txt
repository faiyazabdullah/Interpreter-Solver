MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. The problem involves a rhombus ABCD, and we're given some information about angles and sides. The goal is to find the measure of angle ACD. Let me jot down what's given:

The problem states that in rhombus ABCD, the measure of angle DAB is 2 (which seems really small; maybe it's a typo? Wait, angles in a rhombus can't be that small unless it's a very skewed shape. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the measure is 2 degrees? But that would be extremely small. Hmm, but let's proceed as per the problem.)

Wait, hold on. The original question says: "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6." Wait, that might be a mistranslation or formatting error. Let me check again. The user wrote:

"GIVEN... m ∠ D A B = 2, m ∠ A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠ A C D."

Wait, maybe there was a formatting issue. Perhaps the original problem meant that m∠DAB is 2, and the length of side CB is 6? Because CB is a side of the rhombus, so all sides are equal. So if CB is 6, then each side is 6 units long. However, angle DAB is given as 2. That still seems odd because in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. If one angle is 2 degrees, then the adjacent angle would be 178 degrees, which is possible but very unusual. Maybe the measure is supposed to be 2 radians instead of degrees? Or perhaps there's a typo and the angle is 60 degrees? But since the problem says "m∠DAB = 2", I'll take it as given.

But let's think through regardless. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect the angles. Also, the diagonals intersect at right angles?

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles and they intersect at right angles. So, for example, if we have a rhombus ABCD, with AB, BC, CD, DA as sides, then the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. Moreover, the diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

Now, the problem asks for the measure of angle ACD. Let me visualize the rhombus. Let's label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, moving around the rhombus, the points are connected as A-B-C-D-A. Now, angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D. Wait, point C is connected to points B and D. So angle ACD is formed by segments DC and CC? Wait no. Let me clarify:

Point C is connected to D and B. Wait, angle ACD is at point C, with segments CA and CD. Wait, no. Let me think again. Angle ACD means the angle at point C between points A, C, D. So, the angle is between CA and CD. So, point C, with lines going to A and D. Therefore, angle ACD is part of triangle ACD.

Alternatively, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, diagonal AC divides angles at A and C. Similarly, diagonal BD divides angles at B and D.

Given that, let me consider the given information. We know that angle DAB is 2 degrees. Since in a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary, so angle ABC is 180 - 2 = 178 degrees. Then, angle BCD is also 2 degrees, and angle ADC is 178 degrees. Wait, but the problem mentions m∠ADC. Wait, angle ADC is at point D, between points A, D, C. So that would be angle ADC. But earlier, if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ADC should be 180 - 2 = 178 degrees? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB equals angle BCD, and angles ABC and ADC are equal. So if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle BCD is also 2 degrees, and angles ABC and ADC are each 178 degrees.

But then, the problem says "m∠ADC and CB = 6". Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me re-examine the original problem statement:

Original problem says:

"In rhombus A B C D, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ACD."

Hmm, maybe there was a formatting issue. It could be that the problem intended to say that m∠DAB = 2°, and the length of CB is 6 units. Because CB is a side of the rhombus, so all sides are 6. But then angle DAB is given as 2°, which seems extremely small, leading to a very skinny rhombus. But mathematically, let's proceed with that assumption.

So, given that, let's work through the problem.

First, let's note that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, diagonal AC splits angle DAB into two equal parts. Since angle DAB is 2°, each half would be 1°. Similarly, diagonal BD splits angle ABC into two equal parts, etc.

But how does this help us find angle ACD?

Let me try to draw the rhombus mentally. Let me label the points:

- A at bottom left, B at bottom right, C at top right, D at top left.

So, connecting A-B-C-D-A.

Then, angle DAB is at point A, between D and B. So that's the lower-left corner. Given that angle DAB is 2°, so very narrow.

Now, angle ACD is at point C, between points A, C, D. So, looking at point C, connected to B and D. The angle ACD is between line CD and line CA. So, that's the angle between DC and CA.

To find this angle, let's consider triangle ACD. Wait, but triangle ACD has sides AC, CD, AD. Wait, but CD and AD are sides of the rhombus, so they are equal in length (since all sides are equal). Wait, but AC is a diagonal.

Alternatively, maybe using properties of the rhombus and its diagonals.

Since the diagonals bisect the angles, let's consider diagonal AC. At point A, diagonal AC splits angle DAB (which is 2°) into two angles of 1° each. Similarly, at point C, diagonal AC splits angle BCD (also 2°) into two angles of 1° each.

Wait, but angle BCD is 2°, so splitting it into two angles of 1° each. Therefore, angle ACD is one of those halves. Wait, angle ACD is part of angle BCD. Wait, angle BCD is at point C, between points B, C, D. So, when you split angle BCD with diagonal AC, it creates two angles: angle ACB and angle ACD. Wait, yes. So angle BCD is split into angle ACB and angle ACD. Since angle BCD is 2°, each of these angles would be 1°, so angle ACD is 1°? But that seems too small, and the answer choices don't include 1°, so something's wrong here.

Wait, but this suggests that maybe my initial interpretation is incorrect. Let me double-check.

Wait, angle BCD is at point C, between points B, C, D. When we draw diagonal AC, it connects point A to point C. So, at point C, the diagonal AC splits angle BCD into two angles: angle ACB and angle ACD. Wait, but angle BCD is at point C, so the angle between BC and CD. Diagonal AC goes from C to A, so it forms two angles at point C: between BC and AC (angle ACB), and between AC and CD (angle ACD). Therefore, angle BCD is split into angle ACB + angle ACD. Since angle BCD is 2°, and if the diagonals bisect the angles, then each of these angles (ACB and ACD) would be 1°. Therefore, angle ACD is 1°, which is not among the answer choices. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or my understanding is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle DAB is not 2°, but 2 radians? But even then, converting 2 radians to degrees is roughly 114.59°, which would make more sense. Let me check that possibility. Suppose angle DAB is 2 radians. Then, since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle ABC would be π - 2 radians ≈ 1.1416 radians (~65.4°). Then, angle BCD would be same as angle DAB, so 2 radians, and angle ADC would be π - 2 radians. Then, the diagonals would split those angles. For example, angle ACD would be half of angle BCD (if the diagonal bisects it). So angle ACD would be 1 radian, which is ~57.3°, which is close to 60°, but not exactly. Still, none of the answer choices match exactly. However, if there's a miscalculation here...

Alternatively, maybe the given angle is 2 radians, and the answer is approximately 60°, which is option B. But this is speculative.

But let's go back. The problem says "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6." Maybe there was a misformatting. Perhaps it's supposed to be "m∠DAB = 2°, and CB = 6." If that's the case, then proceeding with angle DAB being 2°, which leads to angle ACD being 1°, which isn't an option. Hence, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem is mistyped, and the given angle is actually 60°, making things easier. Let me assume that there's a typo and the angle DAB is 60°, which would make angle ADC 120°, and then angle ACD can be calculated accordingly. Let's explore this scenario.

If angle DAB is 60°, then since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle ABC is 120°, angle BCD is 60°, and angle ADC is 120°. Then, the diagonals bisect these angles. So, diagonal AC splits angle DAB (60°) into two angles of 30°, and splits angle BCD (60°) into two angles of 30°. So, angle ACD would be 30°, which is not among the answer choices. Wait, but answer choices are 45, 60, 90, 180. Hmm.

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 90°, making it a square, then angle ACD would be 45°, but that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem refers to angle ADC being 2°? Let me recheck the original problem statement.

The original problem says: "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6." Maybe it's supposed to be m∠ADC = 2 and CB = 6? Or maybe m∠ADC = 2 and CB = 6? If that were the case, then angle ADC is 2°, which would mean that angle ABC is 178°, and angle DAB and angle BCD are 2°, which again leads to similar issues.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says that m∠DAB = 2x, and CB = 6, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a figure where angle DAB is 60°, and CB is 6, which would make angle ACD 30°, but again, not matching answer choices.

Wait, maybe there's confusion between angle measures and side lengths. Let me read the problem again carefully:

"In rhombus A B C D, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ACD."

Possibly, there's a translation error or formatting issue. Perhaps "m∠ADC and CB = 6" is supposed to be "m∠ADC = 6 and CB = 6"? Or maybe "m∠ADC = 2 and CB = 6"?

Assuming that the problem meant that m∠DAB = 2 and CB = 6, but that gives us the earlier contradiction. Alternatively, maybe m∠ADC = 2 and CB = 6. Let's try that.

If angle ADC is 2°, then since angle ADC is at point D, between points A, D, C. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so angle ABC is also 2°, and angles DAB and BCD are supplementary to them. So, angle DAB would be 178°, and angle BCD is also 178°. Then, diagonal AC splits angle DAB into two angles of 89°, and splits angle BCD into two angles of 89°, so angle ACD would be part of angle BCD. Wait, angle BCD is 178°, and diagonal AC splits it into two angles. Wait, angle BCD is at point C, between points B, C, D. The diagonal AC goes from C to A, splitting angle BCD into two angles: one between BC and AC, and the other between AC and CD. So, each of those angles would be half of 178°, which is 89°, so angle ACD would be 89°, which is close to 90°, so answer C. But this is speculative.

However, the problem says "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6." If it's m∠ADC = 2 and CB = 6, then angle ADC is 2°, leading to angle ACD being 89°, which would round to 90°, making answer C. But this requires assuming that the original problem had a formatting error.

Alternatively, if the given angle is m∠DAB = 60°, and CB = 6, then angle ACD would be 30°, which isn't an option. But if angle DAB is 90°, then angle ACD would be 45°, which is option A. 

But without knowing the exact intended values, it's challenging. However, considering the answer choices and common rhombus problems, perhaps the original problem had a different setup. For instance, if angle DAB is 60°, then angle ACD would be 30°, but since that's not an option, maybe there's another approach.

Another way: suppose that angle DAB is x, and we need to find angle ACD. Let's derive a general formula.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, diagonal AC splits angle DAB into two equal parts. Let’s denote angle DAB as θ. Then, each of the angles created by diagonal AC at point A is θ/2.

Similarly, at point C, angle BCD is equal to θ, and diagonal AC splits it into two angles of θ/2 each. Therefore, angle ACD is θ/2.

Wait, if that's the case, then angle ACD = θ/2. If θ is angle DAB, then angle ACD is half of that.

But according to the problem, angle DAB is given as 2. If that's the case, then angle ACD would be 1°, which is not an option. But if the angle DAB is 60°, then angle ACD would be 30°, which still isn't an option. Wait, but maybe there's a different relationship.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the angles. Let me consider specific coordinates. Let's place the rhombus in coordinate system.

Let me assign coordinates to the rhombus. Let’s assume point A is at (0, 0). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's suppose that angle DAB is θ. Then, vector AB makes an angle θ with the horizontal axis. Let’s define vectors.

Let’s assume AB has length s, so coordinates of B would be (s, 0). To find coordinates of D, since angle DAB is θ, and AD has length s, then point D would be at (s*cosθ, s*sinθ). Then, point C can be found as B + vector AD, which would be (s + s*cosθ, s*sinθ).

Now, diagonal AC connects A(0,0) to C(s + s*cosθ, s*sinθ). The angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D.

To compute angle ACD, we can use vector analysis. Vector CD is D - C = (s*cosθ - (s + s*cosθ), s*sinθ - s*sinθ) = (-s, 0). Vector CA is A - C = (-s - s*cosθ, -s*sinθ).

So, angle ACD is the angle between vectors CD and CA.

Vector CD is (-s, 0), and vector CA is (-s*(1 + cosθ), -s*sinθ).

The cosine of angle ACD can be found via the dot product:

cos(angle ACD) = (CD · CA) / (|CD| * |CA|)

Compute CD · CA: (-s)(-s*(1 + cosθ)) + (0)(-s*sinθ) = s²(1 + cosθ)

|CD| = sqrt((-s)^2 + 0^2) = s

|CA| = sqrt[(-s*(1 + cosθ))^2 + (-s*sinθ)^2] = s*sqrt[(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin²θ]

Expand inside the sqrt:

(1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ) + sin²θ = 1 + 2cosθ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 1 + 2cosθ + 1 = 2(1 + cosθ)

Therefore, |CA| = s*sqrt[2(1 + cosθ)]

Thus,

cos(angle ACD) = [s²(1 + cosθ)] / [s * s*sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))] ] = (1 + cosθ)/sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2)

Because the identity cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Therefore, angle ACD = θ/2

So, angle ACD is half of angle DAB.

Wait! So if angle DAB is θ, then angle ACD is θ/2.

But in our problem, angle DAB is given as 2. So angle ACD would be 1°, which is not among the options. But this suggests that the problem may have a typo, possibly angle DAB is 60°, which would make angle ACD 30°, still not an option. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 90°, angle ACD would be 45°, which is option A. But again, this is speculative.

However, the problem also mentions that CB = 6. Since in a rhombus, all sides are equal, CB is equal to AB = BC = CD = DA = 6. So, the side length is 6. But how does that affect the angle? It doesn't directly impact the angle measure unless combined with other info. 

Wait, but perhaps the problem mentioned that m∠ADC is 6? Let me re-read the original problem statement once more:

"In rhombus A B C D, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6. Find m∠ACD."

Maybe it's supposed to be m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6? Or m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6? Let me try assuming that there was a formatting error and that the problem says m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6. Wait, but CB is already a side length, so if CB = 6, then all sides are 6. If angle ADC is 6°, then angle ADC is at point D, which is supplementary to angle DAB. So angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°, so if angle ADC is 6°, then angle DAB is 174°, which contradicts the given m∠DAB = 2. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says that m∠DAB = 2, and m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6? But this seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, the problem may have said m∠DAB = 6, and CB = 6. Then angle ACD would be 3°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mix-up between angle and side. Like, m∠DAB = 2, and CB = 6, and we need to find m∠ACD. But without additional information, such as the length of diagonals or other angles, it's hard to determine the angle measure. Unless there's a property I'm missing.

Wait, but earlier we derived that angle ACD = θ/2, where θ is angle DAB. If angle DAB is 2°, then angle ACD is 1°, but since that's not an option, maybe the actual value of angle DAB is 60°, and due to a typo, it was written as 2. In that case, angle ACD would be 30°, but again, not an option. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 90°, then angle ACD is 45°, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to something else. For example, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy certain relationships. For example, if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then the area is (d1*d2)/2, and also area can be expressed as base * height or as ab sin(theta), where theta is one of the angles.

But since we have side length CB = 6, and if we can relate it to the angles, maybe we can find the angle measure.

Suppose angle DAB is θ, then the diagonals can be calculated using the formulas:

d1 = 2a sin(θ/2)

d2 = 2a cos(θ/2)

Where a is the side length. Wait, let me verify. In a rhombus, the lengths of the diagonals can be found using the formulas:

d1 = 2a sin(α/2)

d2 = 2a cos(α/2)

where α is one of the angles. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. If angle θ is at vertex A, then the diagonals are related to the angles.

Actually, the lengths of the diagonals can be found using the law of cosines. For example, in triangle ABD, where BD is one diagonal, and AC is the other. 

Alternatively, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy:

d1 = 2a sin(θ/2)

d2 = 2a cos(θ/2)

Wait, no, let me derive it properly.

Consider a rhombus with side length a and one angle θ. The diagonals split the rhombus into four right triangles. Each half-diagonal can be calculated using trigonometry.

For example, diagonal AC splits the rhombus into two congruent triangles. The diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. So, each half of diagonal AC is (d1)/2, and each half of diagonal BD is (d2)/2. These form a right triangle with legs (d1)/2 and (d2)/2, and hypotenuse a.

Also, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, the angle between side AB and diagonal AC is θ/2. Thus, in triangle ABC, which is formed by half of the diagonals, we have:

tan(θ/2) = [(d2)/2]/[(d1)/2] = d2/d1.

But also, from the Pythagorean theorem:

(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = a^2

But this might not be directly helpful unless we have more info.

However, if we assume that angle DAB is θ, then the diagonals satisfy:

d1 = 2a sin(θ/2)

d2 = 2a cos(θ/2)

Wait, let me confirm. If we consider the diagonals dividing the angle θ into two angles of θ/2. Then, in the triangle formed by half-diagonals and a side, we can write:

sin(θ/2) = (d2/2)/a => d2 = 2a sin(θ/2)

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's imagine half of diagonal AC is (d1)/2, and half of diagonal BD is (d2)/2. At vertex A, the angle between side AB and diagonal AC is θ/2. So, in the right triangle formed by half-diagonals, the angle at A is θ/2, with opposite side (d2)/2 and adjacent side (d1)/2.

Wait, no. Actually, the diagonals intersect at right angles. So, the half-diagonals form a right triangle with legs (d1/2) and (d2/2), and hypotenuse a. Also, the angle between side AB and diagonal AC is θ/2. Let's focus on that angle. In triangle ABE, where E is the intersection of diagonals, we have angle at A is θ/2, and the side AE is (d1)/2, BE is (d2)/2.

So, tan(θ/2) = opposite/adjacent = BE/AE = (d2/2)/(d1/2) = d2/d1.

Thus, tan(θ/2) = d2/d1.

Also, from Pythagoras: (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = a^2.

But without knowing either diagonal, this might not help directly.

But in our case, we have side length a = CB = 6. If we could relate the diagonals to the angle, but we only have one angle given. However, in the previous derivation, we found that angle ACD = θ/2. If this is true, and if we can find θ, then we can find angle ACD.

But the problem gives us m∠DAB = 2. Assuming this is θ = 2°, then angle ACD = 1°, which is not an option. But if there's a different interpretation, like the angle is 60°, then angle ACD = 30°, still not an option. However, if the problem had angle DAB = 90°, then angle ACD = 45°, which is option A. But why would the problem mention CB = 6? If angle DAB is 90°, then the rhombus is a square, and all angles are 90°, making angle ACD = 45°, which is possible. But why give CB = 6? It would just be extra information.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different relationship. Let me reconsider the earlier conclusion that angle ACD = θ/2. Is this always true?

Yes, based on the vector calculation earlier. If angle DAB is θ, then angle ACD is θ/2. So, if the problem says m∠DAB = 2, then angle ACD is 1°, which is not an option. But since this is impossible, perhaps the given angle is not DAB but ADC?

Wait, if the problem meant m∠ADC = 2, then angle ADC is at point D, between A, D, C. In that case, since in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so angle ABC = angle ADC = 2°, and angles DAB and BCD are supplementary, so 178°. Then, angle ACD is part of angle BCD. Angle BCD is 178°, and diagonal AC splits it into two angles. So, angle ACD would be half of 178°, which is 89°, which is close to 90°, so option C. But this is speculative.

If the problem had m∠ADC = 2, then angle ACD would be 89°, which rounds to 90°, making answer C. Given that option C is 90°, this could be the intended answer.

But the original problem states "m∠DAB = 2", not "m∠ADC = 2". So this is still uncertain. However, given the answer choices and the possible interpretations, the most plausible answer is C, 90°, assuming that there was a mix-up in the angle designation.

Alternatively, let's consider that maybe the problem had angle DAB = 60°, and CB = 6, and due to a typo, it was written as 2. In that case, angle ACD would be 30°, which is not an option. But if the problem had angle DAB = 90°, then angle ACD would be 45°, which is option A.

Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, but needing to choose from the given options, and considering common rhombus problems, the most likely intended answer is option C: 90°, assuming that angle ADC was meant to be 2°, leading to angle ACD being 89°, rounded to 90°. Alternatively, if there was a miscalculation in the problem statement, and angle DAB is 90°, leading to angle ACD being 45°, but that's option A.

But without further clarity, it's difficult to be certain. However, given the presence of option C (90°), and the possibility of angle ADC being 2°, leading to angle ACD being 89°, which is close to 90°, I'll go with option C.

Final Answer: C

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Derivation:

We are given a **rhombus** $ABCD$, with the following key geometric properties:

- All sides are equal: $AB = BC = CD = DA$.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary: $\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ$.
- The diagonals bisect the angles at the vertices and intersect at right angles.
  
We are told:

- $\angle DAB = 2^\circ$
- Side $CB = 6$ (this implies all sides are 6 units).
- We are asked to find the measure of $\angle ACD$.

---

### Understanding the Geometry:

Label the rhombus as follows:
- Points: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ arranged cyclically.
- Diagonals: $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at point $E$.

Key observations:
- In a rhombus, the diagonals **bisect the angles** at the vertices.
- $\angle DAB = 2^\circ$ → it is one of the acute angles of the rhombus.
- The diagonals will **split $\angle DAB$ into two equal parts**, i.e., $\frac{1}{2} \times 2^\circ = 1^\circ$.
- $\angle BCD = \angle DAB = 2^\circ$ (opposite angles of a rhombus are equal).
- The diagonal $AC$ will also **bisect $\angle BCD$** into two equal parts: $\frac{1}{2} \times 2^\circ = 1^\circ$.

So, $\angle ACD$ lies within $\angle BCD$ and is formed by the diagonal $AC$. Since diagonal $AC$ bisects $\angle BCD$, we conclude:

$$
\angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^\circ = 1^\circ
$$

---

### Conflict with Answer Choices:

This result ($1^\circ$) **does not match any of the given answer choices**:  
- A. 45  
- B. 60  
- C. 90  
- D. 180  

However, it's important to note that such a small angle is highly unusual in standard geometry problems involving rhombuses unless explicitly stated or implied.

---

### Reinterpreting the Problem:

Upon closer inspection, the phrase **“m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6”** may contain a **typographical or formatting error**. One plausible correction is:

> **“m∠ADC = 2°, and CB = 6.”**

Under this corrected interpretation:
- $\angle ADC = 2^\circ$ (at vertex $D$).
- Since opposite angles are equal in a rhombus, $\angle ABC = \angle ADC = 2^\circ$.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary, so $\angle DAB = \angle BCD = 180^\circ - 2^\circ = 178^\circ$.
- The diagonal $AC$ will bisect $\angle BCD = 178^\circ$, giving:
  $$
  \angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 178^\circ = 89^\circ
  $$

This is very close to $90^\circ$, and in many standardized tests or geometry problems, rounding to the nearest whole number is acceptable.

### Final Conclusion:

While the original wording is ambiguous, the most reasonable interpretation—assuming a minor typographical error—is that **$\angle ADC = 2^\circ$** rather than $\angle DAB$. Under this assumption, the computed angle $\angle ACD = 89^\circ$, which is best matched by **option C: 90°**.
