MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem involves a triangle DJG with some specific conditions. Let me parse the given information step by step.

First, they mention Triangle(D,J,G). So points D, J, and G form a triangle. Then there are lines between each pair: Line(D,J), Line(D,G), Line(G,J). That makes sense for a triangle. 

Next, there's a RightAngle at Angle(D,J,G). Wait, angle at point J? Because the notation Angle(D,J,G) usually means the angle at point J between points D and G. So that would make triangle DJG a right-angled triangle at J. 

Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)). Wait, hold on. Let me check again. The original says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)

Hmm, maybe there was a formatting issue. But it seems like they're saying that all three sides are equal? Wait, but if all three sides are equal, then it's an equilateral triangle. However, there's also a right angle mentioned. But in an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees, so having a right angle (90 degrees) contradicts that. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here?

Wait, maybe the problem meant that two sides are equal? Let me re-examine the original input.

The user wrote:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)

But that seems like three separate equals statements. Maybe it's supposed to mean that the lengths of DJ, DG, and GJ are all equal? Or maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, could it be that two sides are equal? For example, maybe DJ = DG and DJ = GJ, making it an equilateral triangle, but conflicting with the right angle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that two sides are equal. For instance, if the triangle is right-angled and has two legs equal, which would make it an isosceles right-angled triangle. In that case, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is longer. But the problem states that all three lengths are equal? That can't happen because of the right angle.

So maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the constraints are parsed. Let me think again. Perhaps the user made a typo, and instead of all three being equal, only two are equal. Let me consider both possibilities.

Assuming that the triangle is right-angled at J, and that two sides are equal. For example, DJ and GJ are the legs, and DG is the hypotenuse. If DJ = GJ, then it's an isosceles right-angled triangle. Then, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2).

But the question asks to find GD, which is the length of line segment DG. Wait, but if we don't have numerical values given, how can we compute GD? There must be missing information. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back, the problem says "Find G D." Which probably refers to the length of GD. But without any numbers given, how can we determine its value? Unless there's more context or maybe previous problems referenced? Wait, perhaps the problem was part of a series where earlier parts provided certain lengths, but since the user hasn't included that, maybe there's an error here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem includes some implicit information. Wait, looking at the original problem statement again, perhaps there was an image or additional data that wasn't pasted here? Since the user mentions "given geometric constraints," but only provides the symbolic definitions.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the way the constraints are written. Let me recheck:

Original constraints:

Triangle(D,J,G)
Point(D)
Point(J)
Point(G)
Line(D,J)
Line(D,G)
Line(G,J)
RightAngle(Angle(D,J,G)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)

Ah! Now I notice that the user might have had a formatting error. The line "Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)" followed by similar lines. It's possible that the intended meaning is that the lengths of DJ, DG, and GJ are all equal. But as discussed, that's impossible in a right-angled triangle. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the right angle isn't at J, but somewhere else?

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(D,J,G) specifies that the right angle is at J. So angle at J is 90 degrees. So triangle DJG is right-angled at J. Now, if all three sides are equal, that's impossible. Hence, this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a misread.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that two sides are equal? Like DJ equals DG, or DJ equals GJ, etc. Let me assume that maybe there was a typo, and the intended condition is that DJ equals DG. Then, since it's a right-angled triangle at J, with DJ = DG, then it's an isosceles right-angled triangle. Let's explore this possibility.

Let me suppose that DJ = DG, and angle at J is right. Then, triangle DJG has legs DJ and GJ, but wait—if the right angle is at J, then the legs are DJ and GJ, and the hypotenuse is DG. If DJ = GJ, then DG would be DJ*sqrt(2). But in this case, the problem says that DJ equals DG? No, that would imply that DG = DJ, but DG is the hypotenuse. So unless DJ = DG, which would require that GJ = 0, which is impossible.

Therefore, that scenario doesn't work. Alternatively, if DJ = GJ, then DG would be DJ*sqrt(2). Suppose that the problem wants us to find DG given that DJ = GJ. But again, without knowing the actual lengths, we can't compute a numerical value. Hence, there must be missing information here.

Wait, but maybe the problem comes from a textbook or standard problem where certain lengths are implied? For example, maybe there's a figure associated with this problem where specific lengths are given, but the user didn't include them. Without that, it's impossible to calculate GD numerically. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all sides are equal, leading to a contradiction, but expecting us to proceed despite that. Let's try that approach. Suppose that DJ = DG = GJ. Then, all sides are equal, so it's an equilateral triangle. However, in an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees, contradicting the right angle. This is a contradiction, implying no such triangle exists. Therefore, the problem may have a typo or error.

Given that the answer choices are numerical (10, 12, 14, 20), perhaps the intended problem had different constraints. For example, if the triangle were right-angled and isosceles (legs equal), then DG (hypotenuse) would be leg * sqrt(2). If the legs are, say, 10 units, then DG would be 10√2 ≈ 14.14, which is close to option C (14). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if the problem intended that DJ = DG, and the right angle is at J, then using Pythagoras: DG² = DJ² + GJ². If DJ = DG, then substituting gives DG² = DG² + GJ² → GJ² = 0 → GJ=0, which is invalid. So that can't be.

Another possibility: maybe the right angle is at D? Wait, the problem says Angle(D,J,G), which is angle at J. So that's fixed.

Wait, maybe the problem had a different configuration. Let me try to visualize. Points D, J, G forming a triangle with a right angle at J. So J is the right-angle vertex. Therefore, DJ and GJ are the legs, and DG is the hypotenuse. Now, if the problem states that the lengths of DJ, DG, and GJ are equal, which is impossible, but if instead, two of them are equal?

For example, suppose DJ = GJ. Then, it's an isosceles right-angled triangle. Then, DG = DJ*sqrt(2). If we assume DJ = GJ = x, then DG = x√2. But without knowing x, we cannot determine DG. So again, missing info.

However, since the answer choices are given, maybe there's an assumption that the legs are equal to 10, making DG = 10√2 ≈ 14.14, which is closest to option C (14). But this is just a guess based on common problem setups. Alternatively, if the legs are 12, then DG would be about 16.97, which isn't an option. Option D is 20, which would correspond to legs of 20/√2 ≈ 14.14. Again, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the problem had another configuration. Let me consider if the right angle is at D instead. But the problem says Angle(D,J,G), so the angle at J. So that's fixed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involved coordinates. For example, if D is at (0,0), J at (a,0), G at (0,a), making DJ and GJ both length a, and DG as hypotenuse a√2. If the problem asked for DG, then DG would be a√2. But without knowing 'a', we can't get a numerical answer. So again, missing data.

Since the answer choices are present, and assuming that the problem expects an answer based on an isosceles right-angled triangle with legs of length 10, then DG would be approximately 14.14, which rounds to 14 (option C). Alternatively, if the legs are 12, DG would be ~16.97, not matching any option. If the legs are 14, DG is ~19.79, close to 20 (option D). But why would the legs be 14? 

Wait, maybe there's another interpretation. Suppose the triangle is right-angled at J, and DJ = DG. Wait, but DG is the hypotenuse. So DJ = DG implies that GJ = 0, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a typo and meant that DJ = GJ, making it isosceles. Then, DG = DJ*sqrt(2). If the problem provides DJ = 10, then DG = 10√2 ≈14.14, which is option C. If DJ = 12, then DG≈16.97, not listed. If DJ=14, DG≈19.79, which is close to 20 (option D). So depending on the assumed length, different answers.

Since the answer choices are A-D, and the most likely scenario is that the triangle is isosceles right-angled with legs of length 10, leading to DG≈14.14, which matches option C. Alternatively, if the legs are 14, DG≈19.79, which is closest to D (20). 

But without explicit information, it's hard to tell. However, in many standardized problems, common lengths are used. For example, if the legs are 10, then DG is 10√2 ≈14.14, which is option C. Given that, I'll go with option C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are given:

- Triangle `DJG` with vertices `D`, `J`, and `G`.
- Lines: `DJ`, `DG`, and `JG` form the triangle.
- **Right angle** at `Angle(D,J,G)` ⇒ Right angle is at **point J**, making triangle `DJG` a **right-angled triangle** at `J`.
- Equality constraint:  
  `LengthOf(Line(D,J)) = LengthOf(Line(D,G)) = LengthOf(Line(G,J))`

This implies all three sides are of **equal length**:  
⇒ **All sides are equal** ⇒ Equilateral triangle.

However, **equilateral triangles have all internal angles equal to 60°**, which directly **contradicts** the presence of a **right angle (90°)** at `J`.

Thus, **this set of constraints leads to a contradiction**, suggesting a **misstatement or misformatting** in the problem.

---

### **Step 2: Reinterpreting the Constraints**

Since an equilateral triangle is **impossible** under these constraints, we reinterpret the equality condition. A more plausible reading is:

> Two sides are equal, and the third is the hypotenuse — i.e., an **isosceles right triangle**.

In such a triangle:

- The **two legs** (adjacent to the right angle) are equal.
- The **hypotenuse** is $ \text{leg} \times \sqrt{2} $

This fits the given right angle at `J`, and aligns with typical geometric problems involving isosceles right triangles.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the Side Lengths**

Let’s denote the **length of each leg (DJ and GJ)** as $ x $.  
Then, the **hypotenuse DG** becomes:

$$
\text{DG} = x \cdot \sqrt{2}
$$

Now, we need to determine the value of $ x $, but the problem does **not give direct numeric values**. However, **answer choices suggest that DG should be an integer or near-integer value**.

Try testing values for $ x $ that yield a reasonable $ DG $ value from the choices:

| Value of $ x $ | $ DG = x \cdot \sqrt{2} $ | Approximation |
|------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| 10               | $ 10 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 $ | Closest to **14**
| 12               | $ 12 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 16.97 $ | Not in choices
| 14               | $ 14 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 19.79 $ | Closest to **20**
| 20               | $ 20 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 28.28 $ | Too large

From the above table, the best fit occurs when $ x = 10 $, yielding $ DG \approx 14.14 $, which corresponds to **Option C (14)**.

---

### ✅ Final Conclusion

Based on the geometric implications of a right-angled isosceles triangle and the available answer choices, the best estimate for the length of $ DG $ is **14**.
