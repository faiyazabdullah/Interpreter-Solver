MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle EFGH. The question says that angle HGE is 13 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle FGE. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles.

First, a rectangle has four right angles, so each interior angle is 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Now, the points are labeled as E, F, G, H. Wait, since it's a rectangle, the order of the letters should matter. In a rectangle, consecutive vertices are connected by sides. So, assuming the rectangle is labeled in order, like E connected to F, F to G, G to H, and H back to E. That makes sense for a quadrilateral.

Now, they mention specific angles: Angle HGE is 13 degrees. Let me visualize this. Point G is one corner of the rectangle. Let me sketch mentally: Points E, F, G, H forming a rectangle. So, starting at E, then moving to F, then G, then H, then back to E. Therefore, the sides would be EF, FG, GH, HE.

So angle HGE – that's the angle at point G between points H, G, and E. Wait, H-G-E? So, the vertex is at G, with segments going to H and E. So, in the rectangle, side HG and side GE meet at point G. But wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, angle at G should be 90 degrees. But here, they say angle HGE is 13 degrees. Wait, that seems conflicting because angle at G in a rectangle is supposed to be 90 degrees. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation?

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in my understanding. Let me check again. The problem states:

Given: Rectangle(E,F,G,H). RightAngle(Angle(E), RightAngle(Angle(H)). Wait, maybe those are just confirming that angles at E and H are right angles? But in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Maybe the problem is trying to emphasize that? Or maybe there's something else here. Wait, but the main question is about angle HGE being 13 degrees. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram isn't standard. Maybe the rectangle is labeled differently. For example, sometimes rectangles can be labeled such that the points aren't in order. Wait, no—usually, rectangles are labeled in order, so that consecutive letters are adjacent vertices.

But regardless, let's think about angle HGE. So, point G is a vertex of the rectangle. Let me consider the sides connected to G. In a rectangle, each vertex connects two sides. So, for example, if the rectangle is E-F-G-H-E, then at point G, the sides would be FG and GH. Therefore, angle at G (which is normally 90 degrees) is between FG and GH. However, the angle mentioned here is angle HGE. So, H-G-E. That means, starting at H, going to G, then to E. So, the angle at G between H and E. Wait, but in the rectangle, the sides connected to G are FG and GH. So, if you go from H to G to E, then the angle at G would be between segment GH and GE. But GE is not necessarily a side of the rectangle unless E is connected directly to G. Wait, but in a rectangle, E is connected to F and H. Because the rectangle is E-F-G-H-E. So, E is connected to F and H. Therefore, GE would be a diagonal? Because connecting G to E would cross through the rectangle.

Ah! So, angle HGE is formed by the segments HG, GE, and the angle at G between them. Since HG is one side of the rectangle (from H to G), and GE is a diagonal from G to E. Therefore, angle HGE is not one of the internal angles of the rectangle itself, but rather an angle formed by a side and a diagonal.

Therefore, in triangle HGE, which is a triangle inside the rectangle. Since EFGH is a rectangle, HG is one side, GE is a diagonal, and HE is another side? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Let me try to imagine coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Suppose we place point E at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose EF is along the x-axis and EH is along the y-axis. Then, point F would be at (a, 0), point H would be at (0, b), and point G would be at (a, b). So, the rectangle has length a and width b.

Then, angle HGE is the angle at point G between points H, G, and E. So, point H is (0, b), G is (a, b), and E is (0, 0). So, the lines involved are from G to H (which is horizontal line left to H) and from G to E (which is a diagonal down to E).

Therefore, angle HGE is the angle between the horizontal side GH and the diagonal GE. So, in coordinate terms, vector GH goes from G(a,b) to H(0,b), which is (-a, 0). Vector GE goes from G(a,b) to E(0,0), which is (-a, -b). So, the angle between these two vectors is given as 13 degrees.

We can use the dot product formula to calculate this angle. The formula is cos(theta) = (v ⋅ w)/(|v||w|). 

Let me compute that. First, vector GH is (-a, 0). Vector GE is (-a, -b). Their dot product is (-a)(-a) + (0)(-b) = a² + 0 = a². The magnitude of vector GH is sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(a²) = a. The magnitude of vector GE is sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, cos(theta) = a² / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

So theta is arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)). Alternatively, tan(theta) could be used. Let me see. Alternatively, since we know that tan(theta) is opposite over adjacent in the triangle formed by the vectors. Wait, if we consider the triangle HGE. From point G, the horizontal side GH has length a, and the vertical distance from G to E is b (since E is at (0,0) and G is at (a,b)), but actually the vertical component from G to E is downward b units. However, the line GE forms a hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs a and b. Therefore, the angle between GH (horizontal) and GE (diagonal) would satisfy tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = (vertical leg)/(horizontal leg). Wait, but the vertical leg here is the vertical distance from G to E, which is b, and the horizontal leg is the horizontal distance from G to H, which is a. Wait, but the angle between GH and GE is theta. So, in the right triangle formed by dropping a vertical from E to GH? Not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, considering triangle HGE. It's a triangle with sides: HG = a, GE = sqrt(a² + b²), and HE. Wait, HE is the diagonal of the rectangle. Wait, HE would be from H(0,b) to E(0,0), which is vertical line of length b. Wait, but in triangle HGE, the sides are HG, GE, and HE. Wait, HE is vertical, length b; HG is horizontal, length a; GE is hypotenuse sqrt(a² + b²). So, in triangle HGE, angle at G is theta = angle HGE. So, using trigonometry, tan(theta) would be opposite over adjacent. Which would be HE / HG? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle HGE, angle at G. So, the sides relative to angle G: the side opposite to angle G is HE (length b), and the side adjacent is HG (length a). Wait, but HE is opposite to angle G. Wait, let me confirm.

In triangle HGE, angle at G. The sides around angle G are HG and GE. The third side is HE. So, if we want to relate angle G, we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines. Alternatively, think of it as a right triangle? Wait, triangle HGE is not a right triangle unless... Well, HE is vertical, HG is horizontal, but GE is diagonal. So, triangle HGE is not a right triangle. Unless... Wait, HE is vertical from H(0,b) to E(0,0); HG is horizontal from H(0,b) to G(a,b). So, HE is vertical, HG is horizontal, and GE connects G(a,b) to E(0,0). Therefore, triangle HGE has sides HE = b, HG = a, and GE = sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, angle at G is between HG and GE. So, to find angle theta at G, we can use the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: HE² = HG² + GE² - 2*HG*GE*cos(theta). Wait, but HE is opposite angle G. So, HE² = HG² + GE² - 2*(HG)*(GE)*cos(theta). Let me plug in the values:

HE² = b², HG² = a², GE² = a² + b². Therefore:

b² = a² + (a² + b²) - 2*a*sqrt(a² + b²)*cos(theta)

Simplify:

Left side: b²

Right side: a² + a² + b² - 2a√(a² + b²)cosθ → 2a² + b² - 2a√(a² + b²)cosθ

Set equal:

b² = 2a² + b² - 2a√(a² + b²)cosθ

Subtract b² from both sides:

0 = 2a² - 2a√(a² + b²)cosθ

Divide both sides by 2a:

0 = a - √(a² + b²)cosθ

Rearranged:

√(a² + b²)cosθ = a

Then divide both sides by √(a² + b²):

cosθ = a / √(a² + b²)

Which matches our earlier calculation via the dot product. So, θ = arccos(a / √(a² + b²))

Alternatively, we can note that tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent. Wait, in the context of the triangle HGE, if we drop a perpendicular from E to HG, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, consider the slope of GE. The line from G(a,b) to E(0,0) has slope (0 - b)/(0 - a) = (-b)/(-a) = b/a. Therefore, the angle between the horizontal axis (which is the same direction as HG) and the line GE is arctangent(b/a). Wait, but that angle is measured from the horizontal to GE. Wait, but the angle HGE is the angle between HG (which is horizontal) and GE, so yes, that angle is arctan(b/a). Wait, but according to previous calculation, cos(theta) = a / sqrt(a² + b²), which implies that theta = arctan(b/a). Because if cos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse = a / sqrt(a² + b²), then sin(theta) = b / sqrt(a² + b²), so tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta) = b/a. Therefore, theta = arctan(b/a). Therefore, theta = arctan(b/a). So, given that angle HGE is 13 degrees, then arctan(b/a) = 13°, meaning that b/a = tan(13°).

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle FGE. Let me think about angle FGE. Point F, G, E. So, angle at G between F, G, and E. So, similar to angle HGE, but instead of H and E, it's F and E. So, angle FGE is the angle at point G between points F, G, and E. So, similar to before, but involving the other side of the rectangle.

Point F is adjacent to G. In our coordinate system, F is at (a, 0), G is at (a, b), E is at (0, 0). So, angle FGE is the angle at G between points F, G, and E. So, from point G, looking towards F and towards E. So, GF is the vertical side from G(a,b) to F(a,0), and GE is the diagonal from G(a,b) to E(0,0). Therefore, angle FGE is the angle between GF (vertical) and GE (diagonal).

Similarly to before, we can model this. Let me compute tan of angle FGE. In this case, the angle is between the vertical side GF and the diagonal GE. So, similar to before, but now with respect to the vertical. So, if we consider the triangle FGE, which includes GF, GE, and FE. Wait, FE is the horizontal side from F(a,0) to E(0,0)? No, FE is part of the rectangle. Wait, point F is connected to E? No, in the rectangle E-F-G-H-E, so FE is a side? Wait, E is connected to F and H. So, FE is a side of the rectangle. So, in the rectangle, FE is horizontal from E(0,0) to F(a,0). Then, GF is vertical from G(a,b) to F(a,0). And GE is the diagonal from G(a,b) to E(0,0). So, angle FGE is between GF (vertical) and GE (diagonal). 

To find this angle, let's consider the slope of GE. As before, from G(a,b) to E(0,0), the slope is (0 - b)/(0 - a) = b/a. But now, since we're measuring the angle between GF (vertical) and GE, we can think of this angle as complementary to angle HGE, or related to the same tangent value. 

Alternatively, since angle between vertical line GF and diagonal GE can be found using the same approach as before. Let me think about the triangle FGE. Here, GF is vertical with length b (from G(a,b) to F(a,0)), GE is diagonal with length sqrt(a² + b²), and FE is horizontal from F(a,0) to E(0,0), which is length a. Wait, but in triangle FGE, the sides are GF = b, GE = sqrt(a² + b²), and FE = a. Wait, but FE is not part of triangle FGE. Wait, triangle FGE has points F, G, E. So, sides FG, GE, and FE. Wait, FG is vertical from F(a,0) to G(a,b): length b. GE is diagonal from G(a,b) to E(0,0): length sqrt(a² + b²). FE is horizontal from F(a,0) to E(0,0): length a. So, triangle FGE has sides of lengths b, sqrt(a² + b²), and a. 

Again, angle at G is angle FGE. Using Law of Cosines again, or maybe better yet, using trigonometry. Since GF is vertical, and GE is the diagonal, the angle between them can be found using tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent. Wait, if we imagine a right triangle where the angle is between the vertical GF and the diagonal GE. Let me think of the horizontal component from G to E. Wait, the horizontal distance from G(a,b) to E(0,0) is a units left, and vertical distance is b units down. So, the angle between the vertical line GF and GE would be the same as the angle whose tangent is horizontal change divided by vertical change. Wait, since we're measuring from the vertical line GF, the horizontal component is a and vertical component is b. So, tan(theta) = horizontal / vertical = a/b. Therefore, theta = arctan(a/b).

Earlier, we had for angle HGE, theta was arctan(b/a) = 13 degrees. So, angle HGE = arctan(b/a) = 13°, so arctan(b/a) = 13°, which implies that b/a = tan(13°). Therefore, a/b = cot(13°) = tan(90° - 13°) = tan(77°). Therefore, angle FGE, which is arctan(a/b) = arctan(cot(13°)) = arctan(tan(77°)) = 77°. Hence, the measure of angle FGE is 77 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 77. Therefore, the answer is D.

Wait, let me verify once more. Since angle HGE is 13°, which is arctan(b/a) = 13°, so b/a = tan(13°). Therefore, a/b = 1/tan(13°) = cot(13°) = tan(90° - 13°) = tan(77°). Thus, angle FGE is arctan(a/b) = arctan(tan(77°)) = 77°, assuming that 77° is within the range of arctan. Since 77° is acute, yes. So, angle FGE is 77 degrees. Therefore, answer D.

Another way to think: in the rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but here we are dealing with angles formed by the diagonal with the sides. Since angle HGE is 13°, and angle FGE is its complement with respect to the right angle at G. Wait, no. At point G, the original rectangle has a right angle between FG and GH. But angle HGE and angle FGE are two angles that together form the right angle? Wait, no. Let me think. At point G, the rectangle has two sides: FG (vertical) and GH (horizontal). The diagonal GE splits the angle between FG and GH into two angles: angle FGE and angle HGE. Wait, but in reality, the diagonal divides the angle between FG and GH. However, in a rectangle, the angle between FG and GH is 90 degrees. So, if the diagonal GE creates two angles at G: angle FGE and angle HGE, their sum should be 90 degrees. Wait, but earlier we said angle HGE is 13°, so angle FGE would be 90° - 13° = 77°, which is exactly what we found. So, that confirms it. So, this is simpler than using coordinates or slopes. Since the two angles at G add up to 90 degrees, because they are parts of the right angle of the rectangle. Therefore, angle FGE = 90° - angle HGE = 90° - 13° = 77°, which is option D.

This simplifies everything. So, the key idea is that the diagonal divides the right angle at G into two angles whose measures add up to 90 degrees. Given one of them is 13°, the other is 77°. Therefore, answer D.
