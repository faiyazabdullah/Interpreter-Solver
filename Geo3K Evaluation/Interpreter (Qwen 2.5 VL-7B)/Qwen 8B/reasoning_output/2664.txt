MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC with points A, B, C. There are some circles and lines mentioned, but maybe those aren't directly important here. The key information is that angles at I (which seems like a point related to the triangle) for angles AIE and CIF are equal. Also, angle A is given as 10 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle B.

Wait, first, let me parse the diagram again. The problem mentions several points: I, A, B, C, E, F, G, H, D. Then there are lines connecting A-I, B-I, C-I, so point I is connected to all three vertices of triangle ABC? That suggests that I might be the incenter or circumcenter of triangle ABC? But since there are angles mentioned involving I, like angle AIE and angle CIF, perhaps it's the incenter. Because the incenter is where the angle bisectors meet.

So, if I is the incenter, then lines AI, BI, CI are the angle bisectors. Therefore, angle AIE would be part of the angle at vertex A, split into two equal parts. Similarly, angle CIF would be part of angle at vertex C. Wait, but the problem states that the measures of these two angles are equal. Let me think.

Let me denote the angles. In triangle ABC, angle at A is given as 10 degrees. Let me call angle B as x, which is what we need to find. Then angle C would be 180 - 10 - x, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Now, since I is the incenter, the angle bisectors divide each angle into two equal parts. So, angle BAI would be half of angle A, which is 10/2 = 5 degrees. Similarly, angle BCI would be half of angle C, which is (180 - 10 - x)/2 degrees.

But wait, the problem says that the measure of angle AIE equals the measure of angle CIF. Let me visualize angle AIE. Point E is probably on side BC, because in some diagrams, when you draw the angle bisector from A to I, which meets BC at some point. But maybe E and F are points where the angle bisectors meet the opposite sides?

Alternatively, maybe E and F are points such that IE and IF are angle bisectors? Wait, but angle AIE is formed at point I between AI and IE. If E is on BC, then IE would be the angle bisector of angle BIC? Or maybe not. Let me try to think again.

If I is the incenter, then AI is the bisector of angle A, BI is the bisector of angle B, and CI is the bisector of angle C. Now, considering angle AIE. Suppose E is a point on BC. Then IE could be part of another line. Wait, maybe E is the intersection of BI with AC? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a point such that IE is perpendicular to something?

Wait, the problem says Angle(A,I,E) and Angle(C,I,F). So, angle at I between A and E, and angle at I between C and F. So, perhaps E and F are points on AB and CB respectively? Maybe E is on AB and F is on CB? Or maybe they're points on extensions?

Alternatively, since the angles are named as A-I-E and C-I-F, meaning that the vertex is at I, with segments IA and IE forming one angle, and IC and IF forming another. So, if I is the incenter, then IA is the bisector of angle A, so IE could be another bisector? But then angle AIE would be between IA and IE. Wait, unless E is another point. For example, if E is the excenter or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E and F are points on the sides of the triangle. For instance, if we consider the incenter I, then IE could be along BI or CI? Wait, no. Let me try to think about the specific angles.

Suppose angle AIE is formed by IA and IE. Since I is the incenter, IA is the angle bisector of angle A. If E is a point on AB or BC, then IE could be another line. Wait, but without knowing where E and F are located, it's hard to say. However, the problem states that measure of angle AIE equals measure of angle CIF. So, maybe there's some symmetry here.

Alternatively, maybe these angles are related to the internal and external bisectors. Wait, but maybe I should use the fact that the sum of angles around point I. Since I is the incenter, the angles at I can be calculated based on the triangle's angles.

Wait, another approach: Let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter's angles can be determined. The measure of angle BIC (where I is the incenter) is equal to 90 + (angle A)/2. Is that right? Yes! Because angle BIC = 90 + (A)/2. Wait, formula is angle BIC = 90 + (A)/2. Let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, with incenter I. Then angle BIC = 90 + (A)/2. Because the angles at I are formed by the bisectors. So, angle IBC = B/2 and angle ICB = C/2. Therefore, angle BIC = 180 - (B/2 + C/2) = 180 - ( (B + C)/2 ). Since in triangle ABC, B + C = 180 - A, so substituting gives angle BIC = 180 - ( (180 - A)/2 ) = 180 - 90 + A/2 = 90 + A/2. Correct.

Similarly, angle AIB = 90 + C/2, and angle AIC = 90 + B/2.

But how does that relate to angles AIE and CIF? If E and F are points such that IE and IF are related to these angles?

Wait, maybe angle AIE is part of angle AIB or something else. Suppose E lies on BI. Then angle AIE would be part of angle AIB. Let me try to imagine.

Assume that E is on BI. Then angle AIE would be the angle between AI and IE. Since AI is the bisector of angle A, and IE is part of BI. So, angle AIE would be angle between AI and BI. Which is angle AIB. Wait, but angle AIB is 90 + C/2, according to earlier formula.

Similarly, angle CIF would be similar. If F is on CI, then angle CIF would be angle between CI and FI. But if F is on BI, then maybe... Wait, maybe E and F are points such that IE and IF are the same as BI and CI? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe angle AIE refers to the angle between IA and IE, where E is a point on AB extended or something else. Without more info, it's challenging. But the problem says that angle AIE equals angle CIF. So, maybe there's a relationship between these angles leading us to equations involving angles of the triangle.

Alternatively, since the measure of angle AIE equals measure of angle CIF, maybe they are both equal to some expression involving angles of the triangle. Let me assume that angle AIE and angle CIF are both equal to some value, which allows us to set up an equation.

Let me try to express angle AIE. If E is a point such that IE is the bisector of angle BIC, then maybe angle AIE relates to that. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me take another approach. Suppose that angles AIE and CIF are both equal to some value, say θ. Given that angle A is 10°, and we need to find angle B.

Since I is the incenter, let me denote the angles at the incenter. As before, angle BIC = 90 + (A)/2 = 90 + 5 = 95 degrees. Similarly, angle AIB = 90 + C/2, and angle AIC = 90 + B/2.

But how do angles AIE and CIF relate to these?

Perhaps angle AIE is part of angle AIB. Let me suppose that E lies on BI. Then angle AIE would be angle between AI and BI. Which is angle AIB. Wait, that would make angle AIE = angle AIB = 90 + C/2. Similarly, angle CIF could be angle between CI and something. If F is on BI, then angle CIF would be angle between CI and BI, which is angle BIC. But angle BIC is 95 degrees. However, the problem states that angle AIE equals angle CIF. So if angle AIE is angle AIB and angle CIF is angle BIC, then setting them equal:

angle AIB = angle BIC => 90 + C/2 = 90 + A/2 → C/2 = A/2 → C = A. But given that angle A is 10°, then angle C would also be 10°, making angle B = 180 - 10 -10= 160°, which isn't among the answer choices. So this contradicts the given answer choices, suggesting that my assumption is wrong.

Alternative possibility: Maybe angle AIE is not angle AIB. Perhaps E is not on BI. Suppose instead that E is on AC. Let me think. If I is the incenter, then IE could be part of another bisector. Wait, but if E is on AC, then IE would be the angle bisector of angle AIC? No, not necessarily. This is getting too vague.

Another idea: Since angles AIE and CIF are equal, maybe they are both equal to some function of angles A, B, C. Let me try to find expressions for these angles.

Assuming that E is a point on AB, and F is a point on BC. Then IE could be a line from I to E on AB, and similarly for F. But without knowing where E and F are, it's tricky. However, since angles AIE and CIF are given, perhaps they are related to the internal angles.

Alternatively, think about the exterior angles. Wait, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe there's a property I'm missing here. The problem says that measure of angle AIE equals measure of angle CIF. Let me consider that these angles are equal. Let me denote angle AIE = angle CIF = θ.

Let me attempt to write equations using the given data. Let me denote:

Let’s define angle BAC = α = 10°, angle ABC = β (what we need to find), angle ACB = γ.

We know that α + β + γ = 180°, so γ = 180° - α - β = 180° - 10° - β = 170° - β.

Now, since I is the incenter, the angles at I can be expressed in terms of α, β, γ. Earlier, we had angle BIC = 90° + α/2. Similarly, angle AIB = 90° + γ/2, and angle AIC = 90° + β/2.

But how does angle AIE and angle CIF relate to these?

Maybe angle AIE is part of angle AIB. For example, if E is a point on AB such that IE is the angle bisector of angle AIB. Wait, but angle AIB is already divided by the bisector of angle AIB. But I don't see how that connects.

Alternatively, suppose that angle AIE is equal to angle AIB minus some other angle. For example, if E is somewhere along BI, then angle AIE would be part of angle AIB. Suppose IE divides angle AIB into two parts. But without knowing where E is, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe angle AIE is equal to angle AIC. Wait, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's some reflection or symmetry. Given that angle AIE equals angle CIF, perhaps there's some congruence or similarity.

Wait, another thought: If angle AIE = angle CIF, and assuming that these angles are related to the angles at the incenter, maybe we can set up an equation involving β.

For example, suppose angle AIE = angle AIB - angle EIB, and angle CIF = angle CIB - angle FIB. But without knowing where E and F are, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe angle AIE is equal to angle BIC. Wait, earlier we saw angle BIC is 90 + α/2 = 95°. If angle AIE equals angle CIF, which could be angle BIC and angle AIC? Not sure.

Wait, maybe angle AIE and angle CIF are both equal to angle BIC. If that were the case, then angle AIE = angle CIF = 95°, but how does that help us find β?

Alternatively, let's think differently. Suppose that angles AIE and CIF are both equal to some value, and through that, derive relations between the angles of the triangle.

Let me try to consider the entire configuration. Since I is the incenter, and there are points E and F involved. Maybe E and F are feet of the incenter on the sides? For example, E is the foot from I to AB, and F is the foot from I to BC. But then angles AIE and CIF would be angles between the inradius and the sides. However, those angles would be complementary to the angles of the triangle.

For instance, the angle between AI and IE (where IE is the inradius to AB) would be 90 degrees minus half of angle A. Wait, because the inradius forms a right angle with the side. Let me think.

The incenter I has its distances to each side being equal (the inradius). So, if we drop a perpendicular from I to AB, meeting at point E, then IE is perpendicular to AB. Thus, angle AIE would be 90° minus angle IAB. Since angle IAB is half of angle A (because AI is the angle bisector). So angle IAB = α/2 = 5°. Therefore, angle AIE would be 90° - 5° = 85°. Similarly, if F is the foot from I to BC, then angle CIF would be 90° - γ/2. 

Given that angle AIE equals angle CIF, so 90° - α/2 = 90° - γ/2 ⇒ α/2 = γ/2 ⇒ α = γ. So angle A equals angle C. Given that angle A is 10°, then angle C is also 10°, so angle B = 180 - 10 - 10 = 160°, which is not among the answer choices. Hence, this can’t be correct. Therefore, my assumption that E and F are feet of the inradius must be wrong.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. If angle AIE and angle CIF are both 90° minus half of their respective angles, but since they are equal, then α = γ. But that leads to angle B being 160°, which isn't an option. Hence, this suggests that E and F are not the feet of the inradius.

Alternative idea: What if E and F are points where the angle bisectors meet the opposite sides? Like, E is the midpoint of BC? No, not necessarily. Wait, but in that case, angle AIE would involve the angle bisector.

Wait, let's think about angle AIE. Suppose E is on BC, and IE is the angle bisector of angle BIC. Wait, but angle BIC is 90 + α/2. If IE is the bisector of angle BIC, then angle BIE = angle BIC / 2 = (90 + α/2)/2. But this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, if E is on AB and F is on BC, and IE and IF are the angle bisectors of angles A and C, respectively. But then angle AIE would be part of angle A. Wait, if IE is the angle bisector of angle A, then angle AIE would be half of angle A. But then angle CIF would be half of angle C. Setting them equal implies angle A = angle C, leading to angle B = 160° again.

This brings me back to the same contradiction. Since none of the answer choices are 160°, I must have misunderstood the positions of E and F.

Let me re-examine the original problem statement. It mentions points E, F, G, H, D. It also mentions lines AI, BI, CI, AB, BC, CA, and triangle ABC. Angles AIE and CIF are defined. So, maybe E and F are points on AB and BC respectively, such that IE and IF are certain lines.

Wait, another approach: Use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle and compute the angles.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (b, 0), and point C at coordinates such that angle at A is 10°. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, use symbolic variables.

Let me denote angle at A as α = 10°, angle at B as β, angle at C as γ = 180° - α - β.

Since I is the incenter, its coordinates can be determined based on the triangle's sides. But maybe it's easier to work with angles.

Earlier, we considered angle BIC = 90 + α/2. If angle AIE and angle CIF are equal to some angles related to this.

Wait, suppose that angle AIE is equal to angle BIC. And angle CIF is equal to angle AIC. But then setting them equal would give angle BIC = angle AIC.

Which means 90 + α/2 = 90 + β/2 ⇒ α/2 = β/2 ⇒ α = β. So angle B would be 10°, but that's not among the choices either. So this can't be.

Alternatively, if angle AIE = angle BIC and angle CIF = angle AIC, then setting angle AIE = angle CIF would mean angle BIC = angle AIC ⇒ 90 + α/2 = 90 + β/2 ⇒ α = β. Again, same issue.

Alternatively, maybe angle AIE is angle AIB and angle CIF is angle BIC. Then setting them equal:

angle AIB = angle BIC.

As previously, angle AIB = 90 + γ/2, angle BIC = 90 + α/2. Setting equal:

90 + γ/2 = 90 + α/2 ⇒ γ/2 = α/2 ⇒ γ = α ⇒ γ = 10°, so angle C = 10°, angle B = 180 - 10 - 10 = 160°, again not matching choices.

Hmm. All paths lead to contradictions, implying that my assumptions about the positions of E and F are incorrect.

Let me try to think differently. The problem says "Angle(A,I,E)" and "Angle(C,I,F)". So, these are angles at point I, between points A-E and C-F. So, the first angle is ∠AIE, and the second is ∠CIF. So, these are angles at I, with one side being IA and IE for the first angle, and one side being IC and IF for the second angle.

Assuming that E and F are points such that IE and IF are angle bisectors or something else. Let me suppose that E is on AB and F is on CB. Let me try to express these angles.

Let me denote that IE is the angle bisector of ∠AIB. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, let me consider that angle AIE is formed by IA and IE, where E is a point on AB. Then, depending on where E is, angle AIE varies. Similarly for F.

But without additional information, it's difficult to determine. However, the problem states that these two angles are equal. So, there must be a relation derived from this equality.

Let me consider that angle AIE and angle CIF are both equal to some value, say θ. Let me try to express θ in terms of the triangle's angles.

Assume that E is on AB, and F is on BC. Let me consider triangle AIE. In this case, IE could be any line from I to AB. To find angle AIE, we need to know where E is. But since the problem states that this angle equals angle CIF, maybe there's a condition that makes this possible only under certain circumstances.

Wait, if I consider that IE and IF are such that they create equal angles, maybe there's a symmedian or some other property. Alternatively, maybe E and F are chosen such that IE and IF are symmetric with respect to some axis.

Alternatively, since the problem gives angle A as 10°, and asks for angle B, maybe the measure of angle B is 47.5°, which is choice C. But why?

Wait, let me think of special triangles. If angle A is 10°, and angle B is 47.5°, then angle C would be 180 - 10 - 47.5 = 122.5°. Then, maybe the angles at I would satisfy some condition.

Alternatively, let me try to set up equations. Assume that angle AIE = angle CIF = θ.

Let me consider that angle AIE is formed by IA and IE, where E is a point on BC. Then, using the law of sines or some other method.

Alternatively, since I is the incenter, the angles at I can be related to the triangle's angles. But I still don't see how angle AIE and CIF fit into this.

Wait, here's a new idea: Maybe angles AIE and CIF are external angles or supplementary angles. For example, if angle AIE is supplementary to angle BIC, but this is just guessing.

Alternatively, think about the fact that angle AIE + angle BIC = 180°, but again, this is speculative.

Wait, let me go back to basics. Let me assume that I is the incenter, and that angles AIE and CIF are equal. Let me try to express these angles in terms of the triangle's angles.

Let me focus on angle AIE. Since I is the incenter, AI is the bisector of angle A. Let me assume that E is a point on BC. Then, IE is a line from I to BC. Depending on where E is, angle AIE changes. But if E is the point where the incircle touches BC, then IE is perpendicular to BC. In this case, angle AIE would be angle between AI and IE, which is angle between AI and the perpendicular to BC.

To calculate this angle, let me consider the direction of AI and IE. The direction of AI is the angle bisector of angle A. The direction of IE is perpendicular to BC. Let me try to calculate this angle.

Let me denote angle between AI and BC. Since AI is the angle bisector of angle A, and BC is the base. The angle between AI and BC would be angle ABI, which is (β)/2. Wait, no. Let me think.

Actually, the angle between AI and BC would depend on the triangle's configuration. Let me try to calculate it using trigonometric relationships.

Alternatively, let me consider the slope of AI and the slope of IE. But this requires coordinate geometry.

Let me set up coordinates. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C at coordinates (d,e). But this might be complex. Let me try with specific values.

Let me assume a specific triangle where angle A is 10°, and try to compute the required angles.

Let me construct triangle ABC with angle A = 10°, and let's say AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. The incenter I has coordinates based on the triangle's sides.

But this might take time. Let me instead consider using trigonometry.

The angle between AI and IE, where IE is perpendicular to BC. Let me denote the inradius as r, and the distance from I to BC is r. The length of AI can be computed, and the angle between AI and IE can be found via trigonometry.

But this is getting too detailed. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, another idea: In triangle ABC, with incenter I. Let me consider the angle between AI and the altitude from I to BC (which is IE). Let me call this angle φ. Then, φ = angle AIE.

To find φ, note that in the incenter, the line AI makes an angle of α/2 with AB, and the line IE is perpendicular to BC. So, the angle between AI and IE depends on the orientation of the triangle.

Let me consider the angle between AI and BC. Let me denote that as θ. Then, since IE is perpendicular to BC, the angle between AI and IE would be 90° - θ.

So, φ = 90° - θ.

Now, what is θ, the angle between AI and BC?

Since AI is the angle bisector of angle A, and BC is the opposite side. The angle between AI and BC can be calculated as follows.

In triangle ABC, angle at A is α = 10°. The angle between AI (angle bisector) and AB is α/2 = 5°. The angle between AI and AC is also α/2 = 5°. The angle between AI and BC is supplementary to the angle between AI and AB plus the angle between AB and BC? Wait, no. Let me think.

Actually, the angle between AI and BC is equal to 180° minus the angle between AI and AB, minus the angle between AI and AC? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me visualize.

The line AI goes from A to I, the incenter. The line BC is the base. The angle between AI and BC is the angle between AI and the extension of BC if needed. Alternatively, it's better to calculate using the triangle's angles.

Let me consider that in triangle ABI, angle at A is α/2 = 5°, angle at B is β/2 (since BI is the angle bisector of angle B). Wait, no, BI is the angle bisector of angle B, but AI is the angle bisector of angle A.

So, in triangle ABI, angles are: at A: 5°, at B: β/2, and at I: 180 - 5 - β/2.

But how does this relate to the angle between AI and BC?

Alternatively, consider that the angle between AI and BC is equal to angle between AI and AB plus angle between AB and BC. Wait, no, because AI is inside the triangle.

Wait, the angle between AI and BC is the supplement of the angle between AI and AB, plus the angle at B? No, I need a different approach.

Let me use vector analysis. Let me assume coordinates. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C somewhere in the plane such that angle at A is 10°. Let me choose coordinates to simplify.

Let me set AB = 1 unit, and angle at A is 10°. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (cos(10°), sin(10°)), making angle at A equal to 10°. Wait, but this would make AC = 1, and AB = 1, but then angle at A would be between AB and AC, which is 10°. But this setup may not form a valid triangle with BC as the third side. Let me calculate coordinates properly.

Actually, to make angle at A equal to 10°, with AB and AC having lengths such that the angle between them is 10°. Let me set AB = 1, AC = k, and angle BAC = 10°. Then, coordinates of C can be (k*cos(10°), k*sin(10°)). Point B is at (1,0).

Then, the incenter I can be calculated using the formula: I = (aA + bB + cC)/(a+b+c), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, no, the incenter coordinates are weighted by the lengths of the sides.

Actually, the incenter coordinates are given by ( (a*x_A + b*x_B + c*x_C)/(a+b+c), (a*y_A + b*y_B + c*y_C)/(a+b+c) ), where a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C.

But this might get complicated without knowing the exact lengths. Let me choose specific values for simplicity.

Let me set AB = 1, AC = 1, so that triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC = 1, and angle at A = 10°. Then, BC can be calculated using the law of cosines: BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle A) = 1 + 1 - 2*1*1*cos(10°) ≈ 2 - 2*cos(10°). Let me approximate cos(10°) ≈ 0.9848, so BC² ≈ 2 - 1.9696 = 0.0304, so BC ≈ sqrt(0.0304) ≈ 0.174. So, it's a very skinny triangle.

Now, in this case, the incenter I would be located at a position closer to the smaller side BC. But calculating the exact coordinates would require more steps.

Alternatively, let me calculate the incenter coordinates. With AB = 1, AC = 1, BC ≈ 0.174. The lengths of the sides: opposite to A is BC ≈ 0.174, opposite to B is AC = 1, opposite to C is AB = 1.

So, incenter x-coordinate: (a*x_A + b*x_B + c*x_C)/(a+b+c). Here, a = BC ≈ 0.174, b = AC = 1, c = AB = 1. Wait, no: standard notation is a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. So, incenter x-coordinate is (a*x_A + b*x_B + c*x_C)/(a+b+c). Wait, no, the formula is (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a+b+c)? No, actually, it's (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a+b+c)? Wait, no, the formula is weighted by the lengths of the sides opposite to the vertices. Wait, the incenter coordinates are given by ( (a*x_A + b*x_B + c*x_C)/(a+b+c), ... ), where a is the length of BC, b is the length of AC, c is the length of AB.

So in this case, a = BC ≈ 0.174, b = AC = 1, c = AB = 1.

Coordinates of A: (0,0), B: (1,0), C: (cos(10°), sin(10°)) ≈ (0.9848, 0.1736).

Thus, incenter x-coordinate: (a*0 + b*1 + c*0.9848) / (a + b + c) = (1*1 + 1*0.9848) / (0.174 + 1 + 1) ≈ (1 + 0.9848) / 2.174 ≈ 1.9848 / 2.174 ≈ 0.913.

Y-coordinate: (a*0 + b*0 + c*0.1736) / (same denominator) = (1*0 + 1*0.1736) / 2.174 ≈ 0.1736 / 2.174 ≈ 0.0798.

So, incenter I is approximately at (0.913, 0.0798).

Now, let's find angle AIE, where E is the foot of the inradius on BC. Wait, the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is r = area / semiperimeter.

First, calculate area of triangle ABC. Since it's isoceles with sides AB = AC = 1, angle at A = 10°, area = (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(10°) = 0.5 * 1 * 1 * sin(10°) ≈ 0.5 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.0868.

Semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (0.174 + 1 + 1)/2 ≈ 2.174/2 ≈ 1.087.

Thus, inradius r = area / s ≈ 0.0868 / 1.087 ≈ 0.0799, which matches the y-coordinate of I, since the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is the y-coordinate here because BC is horizontal? Wait, no, BC is not horizontal in this coordinate system. Wait, point B is at (1,0), point C is at (approx) (0.9848, 0.1736). So, BC is a sloped line. The inradius is the vertical distance from I to BC? No, the inradius is the perpendicular distance from I to BC, which is r ≈ 0.0799.

Now, to find angle AIE, where E is the foot of the inradius on BC. Let me find coordinates of E.

The line BC: points B (1,0) and C (0.9848, 0.1736). Let me compute the equation of line BC.

First, calculate the slope of BC: (y_C - y_B)/(x_C - x_B) = (0.1736 - 0)/(0.9848 - 1) ≈ 0.1736 / (-0.0152) ≈ -11.42.

Equation of BC: y - y_B = m(x - x_B). So, y - 0 = -11.42(x - 1). So, y = -11.42x + 11.42.

The foot of the perpendicular from I (0.913, 0.0798) to BC is point E. To find E, we can use projection formulas.

The formula for the foot of the perpendicular from a point (x0,y0) to line ax + by + c = 0 is known, but it's complex. Alternatively, since we have the line BC: y = -11.42x + 11.42, which can be rewritten as 11.42x + y - 11.42 = 0.

The formula for foot of perpendicular from (x0, y0) is:

E_x = x0 - a*(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)

E_y = y0 - b*(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)

Here, a = 11.42, b = 1, c = -11.42.

Compute ax0 + by0 + c = 11.42*0.913 + 1*0.0798 - 11.42.

Calculate 11.42*0.913 ≈ 10.42, then +0.0798 ≈ 10.4998, minus 11.42 gives ≈ -0.9202.

Denominator a² + b² = (11.42)^2 + 1^2 ≈ 130.4 + 1 = 131.4.

So, E_x = 0.913 - 11.42*(-0.9202)/131.4 ≈ 0.913 + (11.42*0.9202)/131.4.

Calculate numerator: 11.42 * 0.9202 ≈ 10.51.

Divide by 131.4: ≈ 10.51 / 131.4 ≈ 0.0799.

So, E_x ≈ 0.913 + 0.0799 ≈ 0.9929.

E_y = 0.0798 - 1*(-0.9202)/131.4 ≈ 0.0798 + 0.9202/131.4 ≈ 0.0798 + 0.007 ≈ 0.0868.

So, point E is approximately (0.9929, 0.0868).

Now, we need to find angle AIE, which is the angle at I between points A, I, E.

Points: A (0,0), I (0.913, 0.0798), E (0.9929, 0.0868).

Vector IA: from I to A: A - I = (0 - 0.913, 0 - 0.0798) = (-0.913, -0.0798).

Vector IE: from I to E: E - I = (0.9929 - 0.913, 0.0868 - 0.0798) = (0.0799, 0.007).

Now, angle between vectors IA and IE is angle AIE.

Using the dot product formula: cos(theta) = (IA · IE) / (|IA| |IE|).

Compute IA · IE = (-0.913)(0.0799) + (-0.0798)(0.007) ≈ -0.0731 + (-0.000558) ≈ -0.073658.

|IA| = sqrt((-0.913)^2 + (-0.0798)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.833 + 0.00637) ≈ sqrt(0.839) ≈ 0.916.

|IE| = sqrt((0.0799)^2 + (0.007)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.00638 + 0.000049) ≈ sqrt(0.00643) ≈ 0.0802.

So, cos(theta) ≈ -0.073658 / (0.916 * 0.0802) ≈ -0.073658 / 0.0735 ≈ -1.002.

Wait, this gives cosine of theta ≈ -1.002, which is impossible, as cosine ranges from -1 to 1. This suggests calculation errors due to approximations. Probably due to rounding errors in manual calculations.

However, this indicates that the angle between IA and IE is close to 180°, which doesn't make sense. This suggests that my approximation might be flawed, or that E is not the foot of the inradius, or my coordinate setup was poor.

This approach is getting too error-prone. Let me think of another way.

Since all previous approaches led to contradictions, perhaps the correct answer is C, 47.5°, as it is halfway between 45° and 50°, and sometimes problems have such answers. Let me check if angle B = 47.5° satisfies some condition.

If angle B is 47.5°, then angle C = 180 - 10 - 47.5 = 122.5°. Then, the incenter angles:

angle BIC = 90 + 10/2 = 95°, angle AIC = 90 + 47.5/2 = 90 + 23.75 = 113.75°, angle AIB = 90 + 122.5/2 = 90 + 61.25 = 151.25°.

If angle AIE and angle CIF are equal, perhaps they are related to these angles. For example, if angle AIE = angle CIF = 95°, then it would imply some relation. But how?

Alternatively, if angle AIE = angle CIF = 47.5°, then it might relate to angle B. But without clear reasoning, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me consider that angle AIE = angle CIF = (some expression). Let me assume that these angles are equal to (180 - angle A)/2. For example, if angle AIE = (180 - 10)/2 = 85°, and angle CIF = (180 - angle C)/2. Setting them equal: 85 = (180 - angle C)/2 → 180 - angle C = 170 → angle C = 10°, which again leads to angle B = 160°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if angle AIE = angle BIC, and angle CIF = angle AIC, then setting them equal gives angle BIC = angle AIC → 90 + α/2 = 90 + β/2 → α = β. But α is 10°, so β = 10°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if angle AIE = angle AIC, and angle CIF = angle BIC, then angle AIC = angle BIC → 90 + β/2 = 90 + α/2 → β = α → β = 10°, again no.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the lack of progress, and the presence of option C (47.5), which is 180 - 10 - 47.5 = 122.5, and 47.5 is half of 95, which is angle BIC when α = 10. Maybe there's a relationship where angle AIE = angle BIC and angle CIF = angle AIC, and their equality leads to some equation.

Wait, if angle AIE = angle BIC = 95°, and angle CIF = angle AIC = 90 + β/2. Setting them equal: 95 = 90 + β/2 → β/2 = 5 → β = 10°, which again is not helpful.

Alternatively, if angle AIE = angle CIF = β/2, then β/2 = something. But without knowing, this is guesswork.

Given that I've tried multiple approaches and keep hitting dead ends, and considering that the answer choices include 47.5, which is 180 - 10 - 122.5, and 122.5 is 90 + 32.5, and 32.5 is 65/2, perhaps there's a relationship where angle B is 47.5°, and this is the intended answer.

Since I'm running out of ideas, and 47.5 is an option, I'll go with C.
