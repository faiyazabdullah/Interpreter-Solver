MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two angles, angle 1 and angle 2, that form a linear pair. And we're told that the measure of angle 2 is 67 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1. 

First, I remember that a linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. That means they are supplementary. Wait, right! Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. So, if they form a linear pair, their measures should sum to 180 degrees. 

So, the formula here would be m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°. Since we know m∠2 is 67°, we can plug that into the equation. Let me write that down:

m∠1 + 67° = 180°

To find m∠1, we subtract 67° from both sides of the equation. 

m∠1 = 180° - 67°

Let me do the subtraction. 180 minus 60 is 120, and then minus 7 more would be 113. So, 180 - 67 equals 113. Therefore, m∠1 should be 113 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 113. That seems right. But wait, let me double-check my math just to be sure. 67 plus 113... 60+110 is 170, and 7+3 is 10, so total is 180. Yep, that adds up. So the calculation checks out. 

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The key was remembering that linear pairs are supplementary. If they weren't, maybe there's another relationship, but since they form a straight line, supplementary makes sense. 

So the answer should be B, 113 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Given that ∠1 and ∠2 form a linear pair, they are supplementary angles, meaning their measures add up to 180°.  
We are told $ m\angle 2 = 67^\circ $. Using the property of supplementary angles:  
$$
m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ
$$  
Substitute $ m\angle 2 = 67^\circ $:  
$$
m\angle 1 + 67^\circ = 180^\circ
$$  
Solving for $ m\angle 1 $:  
$$
m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ = 113^\circ
$$  

**Final Answer: B**
