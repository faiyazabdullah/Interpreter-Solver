MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. The question is about a rhombus ABCD, with sides AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. We need to find the measure of angle AEB. Wait, hold on—where is point E? The problem mentions angle AEB, but there's no mention of point E in the given constraints. Hmm, maybe I missed something?

Looking back at the problem statement, the user listed several geometric constraints involving points A, B, C, D and lines between them. But there's no mention of point E. That seems odd because angle AEB involves point E. Maybe there's a typo or missing information? Or perhaps E is supposed to be the intersection of the diagonals? In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so their intersection is often labeled as O (or another letter). But since the problem says angle AEB, maybe E is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD? Let me assume that E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. That makes sense in a rhombus context.

So, if E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD, then angle AEB would be formed at point E between points A and B. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees. So, the diagonals intersect at right angles. Therefore, angle AEB would be 90 degrees? Wait, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe angle AEB refers to some other configuration. For example, if E is a midpoint or something else. But given that the problem includes IsDiagonalBisectorOf for both diagonals, which suggests that E might be the intersection point of the diagonals. Since diagonals in a rhombus bisect each other at 90 degrees, the angle between them is 90 degrees. However, angle AEB would depend on the specific positions. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, if E is the intersection point of diagonals AC and BD, then AE is half of diagonal AC, BE is half of diagonal BD. Then triangle AEB would have sides AE and BE, which are halves of the diagonals. Also, since diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, angle AEB would be 90 degrees. Therefore, m∠AEB is 90 degrees. So the answer might be C. 90.

But wait, before jumping to conclusions, let me check if there's more to it. The problem also gives AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, AB = BC. So setting 2x + 3 = 5x. Solving for x:

2x + 3 = 5x  
3 = 5x - 2x  
3 = 3x  
x = 1.

Therefore, substituting x=1 into AB: 2(1) +3 = 5. So each side of the rhombus is 5 units. But how does this relate to angle AEB? If the sides are known, maybe we can find the lengths of the diagonals using the properties of a rhombus.

In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: 

Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. Moreover, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. Also, the formula relating the diagonals and the sides is:

If d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals, then:

(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = side^2.

But since we don't know the lengths of the diagonals, maybe we need another approach. However, if we can find the angles of the rhombus, that could help. Alternatively, since angle AEB is formed by the diagonals, which are perpendicular, making angle AEB 90 degrees regardless of the side lengths. Wait, but that would make angle AEB always 90 degrees, regardless of the specific rhombus. But then why give the side lengths? Unless there's more to it.

Wait, but maybe angle AEB isn't necessarily 90 degrees. Let me visualize a rhombus. Suppose diagonals intersect at E. Then, in triangle AEB, AE and BE are parts of the diagonals. Since diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB is 90 degrees. Yes, because the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. So regardless of the side lengths, angle AEB is 90 degrees. Hence, the answer should be C. 90.

But let me verify once more. Let's consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rhombus. Let’s place point A at (0,0), and since it's a rhombus, suppose the diagonals are along axes. Let’s say diagonals AC and BD intersect at E, which would be the origin. Wait, but if E is the intersection, then coordinates can be set such that E is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Suppose diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. Let’s denote vectors. Let’s assume that diagonals are perpendicular. Let’s take coordinates where E is at (0,0). Suppose diagonal AC has length p, so AE = p/2, EC = p/2. Diagonal BD has length q, so BE = q/2, ED = q/2. Then coordinates of A would be (-p/2, 0), C is (p/2, 0), B is (0, q/2), D is (0, -q/2). Wait, but then the sides AB, BC, etc., can be computed.

Let me compute AB vector. Point A is (-p/2, 0), point B is (0, q/2). So AB vector is (p/2, q/2). The length of AB is sqrt[(p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2]. Which equals sqrt(p² + q²)/2. But since all sides are equal, this is equal to the length of BC, CD, DA.

But in our case, the side length AB is given as 5 units when x=1. So sqrt(p² + q²)/2 = 5 → sqrt(p² + q²) = 10. So p² + q² = 100.

But without knowing p and q individually, we cannot determine the exact value of angle AEB. Wait, but angle AEB is the angle between vectors EA and EB. Since EA is along the x-axis from E to A (-p/2,0), so direction towards negative x-axis. EB is along positive y-axis from E to B (0, q/2). Therefore, angle between EA (which is pointing left along x-axis) and EB (pointing up along y-axis) is 90 degrees. Because they are perpendicular. Hence, regardless of p and q, angle AEB is 90 degrees.

Therefore, even though the problem provides side lengths, it's just to confirm that the figure is a rhombus (since all sides are equal). But once confirmed, the angle AEB is determined solely by the property of diagonals being perpendicular. Thus, the answer is 90 degrees, option C.

Wait, but why was the side length information given? Maybe there's a trick here. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem states that AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x, and asks for m∠AEB. But since it's a rhombus, AB must equal BC. So solving 2x + 3 = 5x gives x=1, leading to AB = 5. But how does that affect angle AEB? It seems that the angle remains 90 degrees regardless of the side length. Therefore, even with x=1, angle AEB is still 90 degrees. Therefore, answer is C.

But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Could angle AEB refer to another angle? For instance, if E is not the intersection of diagonals. But the problem mentions IsDiagonalBisectorOf(Line(A,C) and Line(B,D), so E must be the intersection point. Otherwise, if E were another point, the constraints wouldn't fit. So yes, E is the intersection of diagonals, hence angle AEB is 90 degrees. Hence, answer C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle AEB $ in rhombus $ABCD$, we begin by analyzing the key geometric constraints and properties of a **rhombus**:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Properties**
- All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
- The diagonals of a rhombus are **perpendicular bisectors** of each other.
- This means the diagonals intersect at **right angles**, forming four right angles at the point of intersection.
- The diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles.

From the problem, we are told:
- $ AB = 2x + 3 $
- $ BC = 5x $

Since $ABCD$ is a **rhombus**, its sides are equal, i.e., $ AB = BC $. Setting these equal:
$$
2x + 3 = 5x \\
3 = 3x \\
x = 1
$$

Substituting back:
- $ AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5 $
- $ BC = 5(1) = 5 $

This confirms that all sides of the rhombus are equal to 5, consistent with the definition of a rhombus.

---

### **Step 2: Interpreting Point $E$**
We are asked to find $m\angle AEB$. While the problem does not explicitly define point $E$, the presence of constraints like:
- `IsDiagonalBisectorOf(Line(A,C))`
- `IsDiagonalBisectorOf(Line(B,D))`

suggests that $E$ is the **intersection point of the diagonals** $AC$ and $BD$. In a rhombus, diagonals intersect at **90°** and bisect each other.

Thus, point $E$ lies at the center of the rhombus, where the diagonals cross.

---

### **Step 3: Determining $m\angle AEB$**

At the intersection point $E$ of the diagonals:
- Segment $AE$ is part of diagonal $AC$
- Segment $BE$ is part of diagonal $BD$

Because the diagonals of a rhombus are **perpendicular**, the angle formed between segments $AE$ and $BE$ (i.e., $\angle AEB$) is a **right angle**.

So,
$$
m\angle AEB = 90^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Regardless of the actual side lengths or specific dimensions of the rhombus, the fact that the diagonals are **perpendicular** ensures that angle $AEB$ is always a right angle.

$$
\text{Final Answer: } \boxed{\text{C}}
$$
