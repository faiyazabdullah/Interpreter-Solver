MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what is being asked. 

So, we have a circle with center Z. Points W, U, V, X, Y, L are on the circle, along with Z. There are several lines drawn from Z to these points: WZ, ZU, ZV, ZX, ZY, ZL. The angles mentioned are angle WZX, which is congruent to angle XZY. Also, measure of angle VZU is 4x, and measure of angle UZY is 2x + 24. Additionally, VY and WU are diameters. We need to find the measure of arc WX (or maybe the arc WUX? Wait, the question says m∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY, so maybe it's about arcs related to those angles.)

Wait, first, let me parse the problem again carefully. 

The problem states that in circle Z, angle WZX is congruent to angle XZY. So, those two angles at point Z are congruent. Then, measure of angle VZU is 4x, measure of angle UZY is 2x + 24. Also, VY and WU are diameters. Need to find the measure of arc WUX. Wait, the notation for the arc is m wide hat WUX. Hmm. Let me think.

First, since Z is the center of the circle, all the radii are equal. Therefore, segments like WZ, XZ, YZ, etc., are all radii. So, angles formed at Z would relate to central angles, whose measures are equal to the measure of their intercepted arcs. 

Given that angle WZX is congruent to angle XZY. Since both angles are at the center Z, their measures should be equal, and each would correspond to the measure of their respective arcs. For example, angle WZX intercepts arc WX, and angle XZY intercepts arc XY. Since they are congruent, arcs WX and XY must be equal in measure. 

But wait, there might be more here. Also, we have measures given for angles involving VZU and UZY. Let me note down:

Let me define variables. Let’s denote:

- Measure of angle VZU is 4x.
- Measure of angle UZY is 2x + 24.

Since Z is the center, these angles are also central angles. Therefore, their measures are equal to the measures of their intercepted arcs. 

So, angle VZU intercepts arc VU. Therefore, measure of arc VU is 4x. Similarly, angle UZY intercepts arc UY, so measure of arc UY is 2x + 24. 

Additionally, since VY is a diameter, that means that points V and Y are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, WU is a diameter, meaning points W and U are endpoints of another diameter. 

Now, since VY is a diameter, then arc VY is 180 degrees because a diameter divides the circle into two semicircles. Similarly, arc WU is also 180 degrees. 

Moreover, since WU is a diameter, then points W and U are opposite each other on the circle. Similarly, V and Y are opposite each other. 

Let me try to visualize the circle with center Z. Let me sketch mentally:

- Point Z is the center.
- Lines from Z to various points: W, U, V, X, Y, L.
- Angles at Z: angle WZX and angle XZY are congruent. So, angle between ZW and ZX equals angle between ZX and ZY. Therefore, arc WX equals arc XY. 
- Also, angle VZU is 4x, which is the angle between ZV and ZU. So, arc VU is 4x. Similarly, angle UZY is 2x+24, which is angle between ZU and ZY, so arc UY is 2x +24. 

Also, since VY is a diameter, arc VY is 180 degrees. Arc VY can be broken down into arc VU + arc UY. Because moving from V through U to Y. Therefore:

arc VY = arc VU + arc UY = 4x + (2x +24) = 6x +24. But arc VY is 180°, so:

6x +24 = 180  
=> 6x = 156  
=> x = 26. 

So x is 26. 

Therefore, measure of angle VZU is 4x = 4*26=104°, and measure of angle UZY is 2x +24= 2*26 +24= 52 +24=76°. 

Now, since angle UZY is 76°, which corresponds to arc UY being 76°, as established earlier. 

Also, angle WZX is congruent to angle XZY. Let's denote angle WZX = angle XZY = θ. Then, since these are central angles, arc WX = arc XY = θ. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc WUX. Wait, arc WUX? Let me check. The notation m wide hat WUX. That would mean the arc starting at W, going through U, ending at X. Or perhaps arc WUX is the arc from W to X passing through U? Wait, but depending on the positions of the points. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX refers to the arc from W to X that passes through U. However, since U is connected to Z via line ZU, and WU is a diameter. Let me think. 

If WU is a diameter, then points W and U are directly opposite each other. So, arc WU is 180°, as it's a semicircle. Now, arc WUX would be arc from W to X through U. But since U is part of the path, perhaps the arc WUX is the sum of arc WU plus arc UX? Wait, no. If you go from W to X through U, then it's arc WU plus arc UX. But arc WU is 180°, and arc UX is something else. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX is just arc WX, but considering the position of U?

Wait, maybe I need to consider how all these arcs add up around the circle. Let me try to figure out the total circumference. The entire circle is 360°, so sum of all arcs should be 360°. 

We know some arcs:

From before:

Arc VU = 4x = 104° (since x=26).

Arc UY = 2x +24 = 76°, as above.

Also, arc WX = arc XY = θ. Let me call them both θ. 

Additionally, since WU is a diameter, arc WU is 180°, which is composed of arc WZ... Wait, no. Wait, arc WU is from W to U, which is a straight line through the center. So arc WU is 180°, so that's fixed. 

But how does arc WU relate to other arcs? Let me see. The arc from W to U is 180°, so if we consider the positions of the points. Suppose we have points arranged such that W and U are endpoints of a diameter. Then, points X, Y, V are somewhere else. 

But perhaps we need to express the arcs in terms of θ and other known values. Let me try to map out the circle. 

Starting from point W, going through X, then to Y. Since angle WZX is congruent to angle XZY, arc WX equals arc XY. Let me assume that the order of points on the circle is W, X, Y, ... but not sure yet. Maybe we need to figure out the relationships between arcs. 

Alternatively, let me think about the entire circle. Let me list all arcs we know:

- Arc VU = 104°
- Arc UY = 76°
- Arc WX = θ
- Arc XY = θ
- Also, arc WU is 180°, which is from W to U. 

But arc WU could be broken down into arc WX + arc XY + arc YU? Wait, depends on the positions. If points are ordered as W, X, Y, U, then arc WU would pass through X and Y. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe arc WU is composed of arc WX + arc XY + arc YU? Not necessarily. It depends on where U is located relative to W and X. 

Alternatively, since WU is a diameter, then point U is directly opposite W. So, if we imagine the circle, with W and U on opposite ends. Then, other points like X, Y, V are placed around the circle. 

But without knowing the exact positions, maybe we need to use the fact that the sum of all arcs equals 360°. 

Let me try to consider all arcs:

Let me suppose that the circle has arcs:

- From V to U: 104°
- From U to Y: 76°
- From Y to ... ??
- From X to Y: θ
- From W to X: θ
- And also, arc WU is 180°, which may overlap with other arcs. 

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to find relations between arcs based on the positions. 

Another approach: Since VY is a diameter, then arc VY is 180°, which we already used to find x=26. 

Similarly, arc VY consists of arc VU + arc UY = 104 + 76 = 180°, which checks out. 

Now, what about other arcs? Let me think about the rest of the circle. The remaining arcs would be arc WV, arc VX, arc XW, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions of all points. 

Alternatively, since we have arc WX = θ and arc XY = θ, and arc UY = 76°, arc VU = 104°, and arc WU is 180°, maybe we can find θ by looking at the total. 

Wait, if we can find other arcs that connect to form the full circle. Let me think: Starting from point V, going through U to Y (which is 104 + 76 = 180). Then, from Y, going to some other points. Also, points W and U are endpoints of a diameter. So, from U, going to W is 180°, but how does that relate to other arcs?

Alternatively, perhaps the arc from U to W is 180°, and arc from W to X is θ, arc from X to Y is θ, arc from Y to V is something? Wait, but arc from Y to V is part of the diameter VY, which is 180°, so arc YV is 180°, but we already have arc UY as 76°, and arc VU as 104°, so adding up to 180°. 

So, perhaps the arc from Y to V is 180°, but how does that connect to other parts?

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find θ, then compute arc WUX. Let me think. 

Let me try to find θ. Since angle WZX and angle XZY are congruent, each is θ. So, angle WZX is θ, which is a central angle, so arc WX is θ. Angle XZY is also θ, so arc XY is θ. 

Then, if we can find the measure of arc WY, that would be arc WX + arc XY = θ + θ = 2θ. 

But how does that help us? 

Alternatively, maybe we can look at other arcs. Let me consider the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°. So, if we can write equations based on the arcs. 

We have:

Arc VU = 104°
Arc UY = 76°
Arc WX = θ
Arc XY = θ
Also, arc WU = 180°, which connects W to U. How does arc WU relate to other arcs? Well, if we start at W, go through X and Y to reach U? Not sure. 

Wait, arc WU could be made up of arc WX + arc XY + arc YU? Let me check. If we go from W to X to Y to U, then yes, that would be arc WX + arc XY + arc YU. But arc YU is 76°, as per angle UZY. So:

arc WU = arc WX + arc XY + arc YU = θ + θ + 76° = 2θ + 76°. 

But we know that arc WU is a diameter, hence 180°. So:

2θ + 76 = 180  
=> 2θ = 104  
=> θ = 52°. 

Ah! So θ is 52 degrees. Therefore, arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc WUX. Wait, arc WUX. Let me clarify what that means. 

Assuming that arc WUX is the arc from W to X passing through U. Wait, but U is a different point. If we go from W to U to X, then that would be arc WU + arc UX. But arc WU is 180°, and arc UX is something else. But maybe there's another interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX refers to the arc from W to X that includes point U. But since U is not between W and X, unless the points are arranged in a certain way. 

Wait, let me think again. Since WU is a diameter, and U is one endpoint. If we have arc WUX, it might be the arc from W to X that goes through U. But if U is on the opposite side of the diameter from W, then going from W to X through U would require passing through the other side of the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc WUX is the major arc from W to X passing through U. But to determine that, we need to find the measure of that arc. 

But let's think about the positions. Since arc WX is 52°, and arc WU is 180°, then arc UX would be arc WU minus arc WX. Wait, if we go from U to X, then arc UX would be arc from U to X. Depending on the direction. 

Alternatively, since arc WU is 180°, and arc WX is 52°, then arc from W to X is 52°, so arc from U to X would be arc WU (180°) minus arc WX (52°), which would be 180 - 52 = 128°. 

But if arc WUX is supposed to be the arc from W to X passing through U, then it would be arc WU + arc UX? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if you go from W to U to X, then it would be arc WU (from W to U) plus arc UX (from U to X). But arc WU is 180°, and arc UX is ?

Wait, arc from U to X: Let's think. If we have arc from U to X, how much is that? 

Earlier, we had arc UY is 76°, and arc VU is 104°. Also, arc XY is 52°, arc WX is 52°. 

Let me try to find the measure of arc UX. To do that, maybe we can find the total of arcs from U to X. 

Looking at the circle, starting from U, going through Y, then to V, then to ...? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since arc UY is 76°, and arc XY is 52°, then if we can find the relationship between U and X. 

Let me consider the entire circle. Total is 360°. 

We have:

Arc VU = 104°
Arc UY = 76°
Arc XY = 52°
Arc WX = 52°
What about the rest? 

If we consider the arc from Y back to V, which is part of the diameter VY. But arc YV is 180°, which is covered by arc YU (76°) and arc UV (104°), totaling 76 + 104 = 180°, which checks out. 

Now, what about the other arcs? What about arc from X to V? Or from X to W? 

Wait, arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°, so arc WY is 52 + 52 = 104°. 

Then, arc WY is 104°, and arc YV is 180°, so arc WV is arc WY + arc YV? Wait, no. If we go from W to Y to V, then arc WV would be arc WY + arc YV. But arc WY is 104°, and arc YV is 180°, making arc WV = 104 + 180 = 284°, which seems too large. That can’t be right, since the total circumference is 360°. 

Alternatively, maybe arc WV is the other way around. Since arc WV can be either the minor arc or major arc. If arc WY is 104°, then arc YV is 180°, but maybe the arc from W to V passing through X and others? This is getting confusing. 

Perhaps another approach. Let me try to calculate the measure of arc UX. 

If we can find the measure of arc from U to X. Let me think. Since arc UY is 76°, and arc XY is 52°, then arc U to X can be found by going from U to Y to X? Wait, no. If we go from U to Y to X, that would be arc UY (76°) plus arc YX. But arc YX is the same as arc XY, which is 52°, but in reverse? Wait, arc YX would be the same as arc XY, but in the opposite direction. But since arc XY is 52°, then arc YX is also 52°, but depending on direction. 

Wait, but if we're going from U to X, then it could be arc UY + arc YX = 76 + 52 = 128°. Therefore, arc UX is 128°, assuming that path. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a shorter arc from U to X. If arc UX is 128°, that's possible, but if there's a smaller arc. 

But since arc WU is 180°, and arc WX is 52°, then arc from U to X would be arc WU (180°) minus arc WX (52°) = 128°, which matches the previous calculation. Therefore, arc UX is 128°. 

So, if the question asks for arc WUX, which is the arc from W to X passing through U, then that would be arc WU + arc UX? Wait, no. If you go from W to U to X, that would be arc WU (180°) plus arc UX (128°)? That would give 308°, which is more than half the circle. But that seems unlikely. 

Wait, but arc WUX is probably referring to the arc from W to X that goes through U. Which would be the major arc WX, passing through U. 

To find the measure of major arc WX, we can take 360° minus the measure of minor arc WX. Since minor arc WX is 52°, then major arc WX would be 360 - 52 = 308°. But that's 308°, which is one of the answer choices, option D. However, the question says "m wide hat WUX", which might be interpreted differently. 

Wait, but maybe the arc WUX isn't the major arc WX, but instead the arc from W to X passing through U. Let me think again. 

If we go from W to U to X, then the arc WUX would consist of arc WU (180°) plus arc UX (128°)? Wait, that would be 180 + 128 = 308°, but that seems very long. But if arc UX is 128°, then going from U to X is 128°, so from W to U is 180°, so total from W to X via U would be 180 + 128? No, that would be overlapping. Wait, actually, when you go from W to U to X, it's not adding the arcs, but taking the path from W to U to X. But since U is a single point, the arc from W to X through U would be the same as arc WUX. 

But how do we calculate its measure? Well, if we consider the entire circle, the arc from W to X through U would be the major arc WX, which is 360° minus minor arc WX. Minor arc WX is 52°, so major arc WX is 360 - 52 = 308°, which is answer D. 

However, let me verify this. Another way: the measure of arc WUX is the sum of arc WU and arc UX. But arc WU is 180°, and arc UX is 128°, giving 180 + 128 = 308°, which is the same as the major arc. 

But why is arc UX 128°? Earlier, I said that arc UX is arc UY + arc YX = 76 + 52 = 128°, which makes sense. 

Thus, the measure of arc WUX (the major arc WX passing through U) is 308°, which is option D. 

But wait, the answer choices include 308 as option D. However, sometimes problems might refer to the arc in a specific way. Let me double-check my steps. 

First, solving for x gave x=26. Then, using arc WU = 180°, which is arc WX + arc XY + arc YU = theta + theta + 76 = 2 theta + 76 = 180 => theta = (180 -76)/2 = 104/2=52. Correct. 

So theta is 52°, meaning arc WX is 52°, arc XY is 52°. 

Then, arc WUX is the major arc from W to X through U. Which would be 360 - 52 = 308°. Hence, answer D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another interpretation. Maybe arc WUX refers to arc WU plus arc UX? But that would be 180 + 128 = 308°, same result. 

Alternatively, maybe the question meant arc WUX as arc from W to U to X, which is the same as arc WUX. Either way, the measure is 308°, so answer D. 

But let me check the answer choices again: 

A. 52  
B. 104  
C. 154  
D. 308  

Yes, D is 308. 

But wait, is there another possibility? Let me think again. Could the arc WUX be referring to something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for arc WX, but since angle WZX is congruent to angle XZY, and those angles are 52°, so arc WX is 52°, but that's answer A. But answer A is 52. However, that contradicts our previous conclusion. 

Wait, but the question specifically says "Find m wide hat WUX." The notation m wide hat usually denotes the measure of the arc. The arc WUX likely refers to the arc from W to X that passes through U. Which would be the major arc, as explained. 

But maybe I made a mistake in calculating arc UX. Let me re-examine that. 

We had arc UY = 76°, arc XY = 52°. So, if we go from U to Y to X, that's arc UY (76°) plus arc YX. But arc YX is the same as arc XY, which is 52°, but in the opposite direction. Wait, arc YX is the same as arc XY, which is 52°, so arc UY + arc YX = 76 + 52 = 128°, which is arc UX. So that's correct. 

Hence, arc UX is 128°, and arc WU is 180°, but arc WUX is the path from W to U to X, which is arc WU (from W to U) plus arc UX (from U to X)? Wait, no, that would imply going from W to U to X, which is a longer path. But arc WUX is a single arc, not multiple arcs added together. 

Actually, arc WUX is the arc that starts at W, goes through U, and ends at X. Which is essentially the major arc WX passing through U. So, its measure is 360° minus the measure of arc WX. 

Since arc WX is 52°, then major arc WX is 360 - 52 = 308°, which is answer D. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that arc WUX was the sum of arc WU (180°) and arc UX (128°), which totals 308°, which is the same result. So regardless of the method, answer is D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way that arc WUX could be interpreted. For instance, if points are arranged such that U lies on arc WX, but that conflicts with WU being a diameter. 

No, because if U were on arc WX, then WU wouldn't be a diameter. Since W and U are endpoints of a diameter, they are opposite each other. So, U cannot lie on arc WX unless arc WX is a semicircle. But arc WX is only 52°, so that's not possible. Thus, arc WUX must be the major arc. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. 

But let me cross-validate with another approach. 

Total circle is 360°. 

Known arcs:

- Arc VU = 104°
- Arc UY = 76°
- Arc WX = 52°
- Arc XY = 52°

Let me check if these account for the entire circle. 

Summing up these arcs: 104 + 76 + 52 + 52 = 104 +76 is 180, plus 52 +52 is 104, total 284°. 

That leaves 360 - 284 = 76° unaccounted for. Where is this arc? 

Possibly, there is another arc from Y to V? Wait, arc YV is already accounted for as 180°, which is arc YU + arc UV = 76 +104 = 180. 

But then, where is the remaining 76°? 

Maybe there is another arc from X to V? Let me think. 

From point X, moving to point V. How much is that arc? 

If we consider the circle, after accounting for arcs WX, XY, VU, UY, we still have some arcs left. 

For example, arc from X to V. Let me think. If we go from X to Y to U to V, that's arc XY (52°) + arc YU (76°) + arc UV (104°) = 52 +76 +104 = 232°. But that seems too much. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an arc from X to V directly. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since we have arc WX = 52°, arc XY = 52°, arc YU = 76°, arc UV = 104°, and arc VW? 

Wait, what is arc VW? If we consider the entire circle, we have:

Start from W, go through X, Y, U, V, and back to W. 

So, arc W to X: 52°  
arc X to Y: 52°  
arc Y to U: 76°  
arc U to V: 104°  
arc V to W: ?

Total of these arcs is 52 +52 +76 +104 = 284°, so arc VW is 360 - 284 = 76°. 

So arc VW is 76°. 

Therefore, the circle is divided into arcs:

- WX: 52°
- XY: 52°
- YU: 76°
- UV: 104°
- VW: 76°

Check total: 52 +52 +76 +104 +76 = 52+52=104; 76+104=180; 104 + 180 +76 = 360. Yes, that adds up. 

So, arc VW is 76°, which is same as arc UY. Interesting. 

Now, returning to the original question: measure of arc WUX. 

If the arc WUX is the arc from W to X through U, then it would traverse from W to U to X. 

From W to U is arc WU, which is 180°, and from U to X is arc UX, which we previously determined as 128°. But adding them gives 180 + 128 = 308°, which is the same as the major arc WX. 

Alternatively, arc WUX could be considered as arc W to U to X, which is indeed the major arc WX. 

Thus, the measure is 308°, which is option D. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way to get this value. 

Alternatively, since arc WX is 52°, and arc WUX is the rest of the circle, which is 360 - 52 = 308°, which is the same. 

So, regardless of the method, the answer is D. 

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in interpreting arc WUX. Perhaps it's not the major arc, but something else. 

Suppose that arc WUX is the arc from W to U to X, but since U is a point on the circle, then arc WUX would be the combination of arc WU and arc UX. But arc WU is 180°, arc UX is 128°, totaling 308°, same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe the question intended arc WX, which is 52°, but that would be answer A. However, the notation suggests it's WUX, implying passing through U. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to arc WX, but due to some misinterpretation, but given the presence of U in the arc name, it's more likely to be the major arc. 

Therefore, I conclude the answer is D. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{D}

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution

We are working within **circle $ \odot Z $**, with the center at point $ Z $. Several points — $ W, U, V, X, Y, L $ — lie on the circle, and several lines are drawn from the center $ Z $ to these points. The goal is to find the measure of the arc denoted as $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $, i.e., the arc from $ W $ to $ X $ passing through $ U $, under the given conditions.

---

### Step 1: Understand Given Information

We are told:

- $ \angle WZX \cong \angle XZY $
- $ m\angle VZU = 4x $
- $ m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 $
- $ VY $ and $ WU $ are **diameters**

Because $ VY $ and $ WU $ are **diameters**, the corresponding arcs $ \overset{\frown}{VY} $ and $ \overset{\frown}{WU} $ are each **semicircles**, so:

$$
\text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{VY} = \text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{WU} = 180^\circ
$$

Also, because $ Z $ is the center, all angles at $ Z $ are **central angles**, and thus:

- $ m\angle VZU = m\overset{\frown}{VU} = 4x $
- $ m\angle UZY = m\overset{\frown}{UY} = 2x + 24 $

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Using the fact that arc $ \overset{\frown}{VY} = 180^\circ $, and that:

$$
\overset{\frown}{VY} = \overset{\frown}{VU} + \overset{\frown}{UY}
$$

Substitute the expressions:

$$
4x + (2x + 24) = 180 \\
6x + 24 = 180 \\
6x = 156 \\
x = 26
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute Known Arc Measures

Now plug $ x = 26 $ into the expressions:

- $ m\angle VZU = 4x = 104^\circ \Rightarrow \overset{\frown}{VU} = 104^\circ $
- $ m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 = 76^\circ \Rightarrow \overset{\frown}{UY} = 76^\circ $

So far, we've accounted for:

- $ \overset{\frown}{VU} = 104^\circ $
- $ \overset{\frown}{UY} = 76^\circ $

### Step 4: Use Congruent Angles to Determine Other Arcs

We’re told:

> $ \angle WZX \cong \angle XZY $

Since both are **central angles**, the intercepted arcs are congruent:

$$
\overset{\frown}{WX} = \overset{\frown}{XY}
$$

Let’s denote:

$$
\overset{\frown}{WX} = \overset{\frown}{XY} = \theta
$$

Now, recall that $ \overset{\frown}{WU} $ is a **diameter**, so:

$$
\overset{\frown}{WU} = 180^\circ
$$

And we can break this arc into:

$$
\overset{\frown}{WU} = \overset{\frown}{WX} + \overset{\frown}{XY} + \overset{\frown}{YU}
$$

Plug in known values:

$$
\theta + \theta + 76^\circ = 180^\circ \\
2\theta + 76 = 180 \\
2\theta = 104 \\
\theta = 52^\circ
$$

So:

- $ \overset{\frown}{WX} = 52^\circ $
- $ \overset{\frown}{XY} = 52^\circ $

### Step 5: Interpret the Requested Arc — $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $

We are asked to find the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{WUX} $, which is the arc from $ W $ to $ X $ **passing through** point $ U $. This is the **major arc** from $ W $ to $ X $, since it goes through the opposite side of the circle.

To find the measure of this arc, subtract the **minor arc** $ \overset{\frown}{WX} $ from the total circle:

$$
\text{Major arc } \overset{\frown}{WX} = 360^\circ - \overset{\frown}{WX} = 360^\circ - 52^\circ = 308^\circ
$$
