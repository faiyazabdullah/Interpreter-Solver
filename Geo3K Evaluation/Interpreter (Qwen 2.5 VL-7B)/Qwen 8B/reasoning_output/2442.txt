MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D connected in order. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA form the sides. Then there are these right angles at each corner: RightAngle(A,B,C), which means angle at B between A-B-C is a right angle. Similarly, right angles at C (between B-C-D), D (between C-D-A), and A (between D-A-B). Also, all four angles are equal in measure. Wait, but if they're all right angles, that would make each angle 90 degrees. But then the question says "Find x"—but maybe I'm misunderstanding?

Wait, hold on. Let me re-read the problem. It says:

Given Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) with Points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, CD, DA. Then it lists four RightAngle conditions: RightAngle(A,B,C), RightAngle(B,C,D), RightAngle(C,D,A), RightAngle(D,A,B). And then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), etc., so all four angles are equal in measure. Wait, but if each of those angles is a right angle, then each angle is 90 degrees. But that would mean the quadrilateral is a rectangle, since all angles are 90 degrees. However, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in that case, all angles are 90 degrees, so x would be 90? But then why is the question asking for x? Maybe I misread something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't stating that all angles are right angles, but that each consecutive angle is a right angle? Wait no—each angle mentioned is a right angle. Let me check again.

The constraints are:

- RightAngle(A,B,C): This is angle at point B between segments BA and BC. So angle ABC is a right angle.

Similarly, RightAngle(B,C,D): angle at C between CB and CD, so angle BCD is a right angle.

RightAngle(C,D,A): angle at D between DC and DA, so angle CDA is a right angle.

RightAngle(D,A,B): angle at A between AD and AB, so angle DAB is a right angle.

So all four angles of the quadrilateral are right angles. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. In a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. Hence, each angle measure is 90 degrees. So if the question is asking for x, which is presumably one of the angles, then x would be 90 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 90. So the answer should be C.

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Because sometimes problems might refer to different types of angles. For example, could there be another interpretation of the angles? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral isn't convex? Or maybe it's self-intersecting? But even then, having four right angles would still require specific conditions. However, in standard Euclidean geometry, a quadrilateral with four right angles must be a rectangle or a square. Since a rectangle has four right angles, and all angles are 90 degrees. Therefore, regardless of side lengths, each angle is 90 degrees. Thus, each angle measure is 90°, so x=90. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. Let me check if there's any possibility that the angles aren't right angles. Wait, the problem says "RightAngle(A,B,C)" etc., so each angle is specified as a right angle. So all angles are 90°, making the quadrilateral a rectangle. Hence, x is 90°, so answer C.
