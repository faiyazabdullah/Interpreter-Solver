QUESTION:
\odot P \cong \odot Q. Find x.

CHOICES:
A. 7
B. 11
C. 22
D. 44

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that circles P and Q are congruent. So congruent circles have the same radius. Then there's an equation given: Equals(3x, 7x - 44). Wait, maybe that's saying that 3x equals 7x minus 44? Because they mentioned RadiusOf(Circle(P)) and RadiusOf(Circle(Q)), so since the circles are congruent, their radii must be equal. Therefore, 3x equals 7x minus 44. Let me write that down as an equation.

So, 3x = 7x - 44. Now I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 3x from both sides to get 0 on the left. That would give me 0 = 4x - 44. Then adding 44 to both sides gives 44 = 4x. Dividing both sides by 4, x = 11. 

Wait, but let me check again. If the radii are equal, then 3x = 7x - 44. Solving:

Subtract 7x from both sides: 3x -7x = -44 → -4x = -44 → x = (-44)/(-4) = 11. Yep, that's correct. So x is 11. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 11. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the original problem. The problem states that the radii are equal, which leads to 3x equals 7x -44. Is there another way to interpret the given equality? For example, maybe the problem was written with some notation that might mean something else? But according to the problem statement, it's Equals(3x, 7x - 44), so that's just setting them equal. So solving that equation gives x=11. So answer B. Yeah, that seems right. No mistakes here.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the geometric constraint given in the problem:

- It is stated that $\odot P \cong \odot Q$, meaning the two circles are **congruent**.  
- Congruent circles have **equal radii**, so:  
  $$
  \text{Radius}(P) = \text{Radius}(Q)
  $$

We are also told that:  
$$
\text{Radius}(P) = 3x, \quad \text{Radius}(Q) = 7x - 44
$$

Since the radii are equal, set the expressions equal to each other:
$$
3x = 7x - 44
$$

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Start with the equation:
   $$
   3x = 7x - 44
   $$

2. Subtract $ 7x $ from both sides:
   $$
   3x - 7x = -44
   $$

3. Simplify:
   $$
   -4x = -44
   $$

4. Divide both sides by $-4$:
   $$
   x = \frac{-44}{-4} = 11
   $$

Thus, the solution is $ x = 11 $.

### Final Answer Selection:

From the answer choices:

- A. 7  
- B. 11  
- C. 22  
- D. 44  

The correct answer is **B**.
