MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a rectangle EFGH. The points E, F, G, H form a rectangle. Then there's a point K connected to E, F, G, H with lines. Also, there are right angles at each corner involving point K. Hmm. Let me visualize this.

First, since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The diagonals EG and FH should be equal in length because in a rectangle, diagonals are congruent. That's one property I remember.

Now, the question says that FK = 32 feet, and we need to find EG. Wait, so maybe there's some relation between FK and the diagonal EG? But how?

Looking at the constraints again: There are four right angles mentioned. Angle at EKF, angle at FKG, angle at GKH, and angle at HKE. So point K seems to be forming right angles with adjacent corners of the rectangle. Maybe K is inside the rectangle such that connecting K to each corner makes those right angles?

Wait, but if you connect K to E, F, G, H, then each of these lines forms a right angle. Let me think. For example, Angle(E,K,F) is a right angle. So triangle EKF has a right angle at K. Similarly for the others. So K is a point such that when connected to consecutive vertices of the rectangle, each creates a right angle.

This reminds me of something... Maybe K is the center of the rectangle? Or maybe it's related to the intersection of the diagonals? Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection is the midpoint. However, if K were the center, then connecting K to the vertices would create various triangles. But here, each of those connections forms a right angle. Is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe K lies on both diagonals? Wait, if K is the intersection point of the diagonals, then connecting K to the vertices would make segments that are parts of the diagonals. But then the angles formed wouldn't necessarily be right angles. Unless... Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: Since each angle at K is a right angle, like angle EKF is right. So line KE is perpendicular to line KF. Similarly, line KF is perpendicular to KG, etc. Wait, but if KE is perpendicular to KF, and KF is perpendicular to KG, then KE is parallel to KG? Because they're both perpendicular to the same line. But since E and G are opposite corners of the rectangle, then EG is a diagonal. So maybe KE and KG are along the directions of the sides?

Wait, maybe K is positioned such that each of these lines KE, KF, KG, KH are perpendicular to each other? Like, each consecutive pair forms a right angle. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Let me consider coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to the rectangle. Suppose E is at (0, 0), F at (a, 0), G at (a, b), H at (0, b). Then the diagonals are EG from (0,0) to (a,b), and FH from (a,0) to (0,b).

Now, point K is such that:

- Angle EKF is right. So vectors KE and KF are perpendicular. Similarly for other angles.

So, suppose K has coordinates (x, y). Let's see.

For angle EKF to be right: The vectors KE and KF should be perpendicular. Vector KE is (x - 0, y - 0) = (x, y). Vector KF is (x - a, y - 0) = (x - a, y). Their dot product should be zero.

So x(x - a) + y * y = 0 → x² - a x + y² = 0.

Similarly, angle FKG is right. So vectors KF and KG are perpendicular. Vector KF is (x - a, y), vector KG is (x - a, y - b). Wait, no: Point G is (a, b). So vector KG is (a - x, b - y). Wait, the direction depends on which way the vectors are pointing. Wait, the angle at K for FKG means that the lines KF and KG form a right angle. So vectors KF and KG should be perpendicular.

Vector KF is from K to F: (a - x, 0 - y). Vector KG is from K to G: (a - x, b - y). Wait, no, wait. Wait, angle at K between F-K-G. So the vectors are KF and KG. So KF is from K to F: (F - K) = (a - x, 0 - y). KG is from K to G: (G - K) = (a - x, b - y). These two vectors need to be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

Therefore: (a - x)(a - x) + (-y)(b - y) = 0 → (a - x)^2 - y(b - y) = 0.

Similarly, next angle GKH is right. So vectors KG and KH are perpendicular. Vector KG is (a - x, b - y). Vector KH is (0 - x, b - y). So their dot product is zero:

(a - x)(-x) + (b - y)(b - y) = 0 → -x(a - x) + (b - y)^2 = 0.

Then angle HKE is right. Vectors KH and KE are perpendicular. Vector KH is (-x, b - y). Vector KE is (x, y). Dot product: (-x)(x) + (b - y)(y) = -x² + y(b - y) = 0.

Hmm, okay. Now, let's write down these equations:

From angle EKF: x² - a x + y² = 0 ...(1)

From angle FKG: (a - x)^2 - y(b - y) = 0 ...(2)

From angle GKH: -x(a - x) + (b - y)^2 = 0 ...(3)

From angle HKE: -x² + y(b - y) = 0 ...(4)

Also, note that equation (4): -x² + y(b - y) = 0 → y(b - y) = x². From equation (1): x² = a x - y². Therefore substituting into equation (4):

y(b - y) = a x - y² → y b - y² = a x - y² → y b = a x → x = (b/a) y.

So x = (b/a)y.

Let me substitute x = (b/a)y into equation (1): x² - a x + y² = 0.

Substitute x = (b/a)y:

[(b²/a²)y²] - a*(b/a)y + y² = 0 → (b²/a²)y² - b y + y² = 0.

Combine terms:

[ (b²/a²) + 1 ] y² - b y = 0 → factor:

y [ ( (b² + a²)/a² ) y - b ] = 0.

So either y=0, which would mean K is on the x-axis, but then angle EKF might not hold unless specific conditions. Alternatively,

( (b² + a²)/a² ) y - b = 0 → ((b² + a²)/a²) y = b → y = (b * a²)/(a² + b²).

Then x = (b/a)y = (b/a)*(b a²)/(a² + b²) ) = (b² a)/(a² + b²).

So coordinates of K are ( (ab²)/(a² + b²), (a² b)/(a² + b²) ).

Interesting. Now, also, we can check equation (2):

Equation (2): (a - x)^2 - y(b - y) = 0.

We already know from equation (4) that y(b - y) = x². Therefore equation (2) becomes:

(a - x)^2 - x² = 0 → expanding (a - x)^2 - x² = a² - 2a x + x² - x² = a² - 2a x = 0 → a² = 2a x → divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0): a = 2x → x = a/2.

But earlier we had x = (ab²)/(a² + b²). Therefore:

(ab²)/(a² + b²) = a/2 → divide both sides by a:

(b²)/(a² + b²) = 1/2 → cross multiply:

2b² = a² + b² → a² = b² → a = ±b. But since lengths are positive, a = b. Therefore, the rectangle is actually a square?

Wait, but the problem states that EFGH is a rectangle, not necessarily a square. But according to this, the only solution is when a = b, making it a square. However, the problem didn't specify that it's a square. So does this mean that our assumption leads us to a square? But then the answer would depend on that.

But wait, maybe there's another condition? Let me check equation (3):

From equation (3): -x(a - x) + (b - y)^2 = 0.

Earlier, we had from equation (4) that y(b - y) = x². Also, from equation (1): x² = a x - y². So maybe we can use these relations.

Alternatively, since we found that a = b, then the rectangle is a square. Let me proceed under that assumption.

If a = b, then the rectangle is a square with side length a. Then the diagonal EG has length sqrt(a² + a²) = a√2.

But we are told that FK = 32 feet. Let me find FK in terms of a.

Point F is at (a, 0). Point K is at ( (ab²)/(a² + b²), (a² b)/(a² + b²) ). Since a = b, let's substitute b = a:

x-coordinate of K: (a * a²)/(a² + a²) = a³/(2a²) = a/2.

Similarly y-coordinate: (a² * a)/(2a²) = a³ / 2a² = a/2. So K is at (a/2, a/2), which is the center of the square. So FK is the distance from F(a, 0) to (a/2, a/2).

Calculating distance: sqrt[ (a - a/2)^2 + (0 - a/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (a/2)^2 + (-a/2)^2 ] = sqrt( a²/4 + a²/4 ) = sqrt( a²/2 ) = a / √2.

Given that FK = 32, so a / √2 = 32 → a = 32√2. Then the diagonal EG is a√2 = (32√2)*√2 = 32*2 = 64 feet. So EG = 64.

Looking back at the answer choices, option D is 64. So that suggests the answer is D.

But wait, the problem didn't state that the rectangle is a square. But according to our deduction, the only possibility is that it's a square. But why?

Because when we solved the equations, we arrived at a conclusion that a = b. So even though the problem says it's a rectangle, the constraints given (the right angles at K) force it to be a square. Hence, EG equals twice FK. Wait, because in this case, FK was a / √2, and EG is a√2. So EG = (FK) * (√2) * √2 = FK * 2. So if FK is 32, then EG is 64. Which matches answer D.

But let me verify once more. Suppose the rectangle isn't a square. But according to the equations above, solving them led us to a = b. So unless there's an error in my reasoning...

Wait, let me re-examine the steps. When we derived from equation (2) that a² = 2a x, leading to x = a/2. And from equation (1), x = ab²/(a² + b²). Setting them equal gives ab²/(a² + b²) = a/2 → cancelling a: b²/(a² + b²) = 1/2 → cross multiplying: 2b² = a² + b² → a² = b². So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the rectangle must be a square. Thus, EG is the diagonal of the square, which is a√2. And since FK is a / √2, then EG = 2 * FK. Hence, 2*32 = 64. So answer D.

But let me check if there's another approach without coordinates.

Alternative approach: Since K forms right angles with consecutive sides, maybe K is the orthocenter or something else. But in a rectangle, the diagonals intersect at the center. But earlier analysis shows that K is the center. However, in that case, connecting K to the vertices would give lines from center to vertices, but those lines aren't perpendicular to each other. Wait, but in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no, in a square the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees? No, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes! In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are congruent and they bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, in a square, the diagonals are congruent and they bisect each other, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. In a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, but in a general rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular. They are congruent but not perpendicular unless it's a square.

So in our problem, the fact that K is such that each angle around it is a right angle implies that the rectangle must be a square, as per our previous analysis. Therefore, the diagonal EG is twice FK. Hence, 32 * 2 = 64. So answer D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of the diagonal $ EG $ in rectangle $ EFGH $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration. We are told:

- Rectangle $ EFGH $ has right angles at all its corners.
- Point $ K $ connects to each vertex $ E, F, G, H $, and forms **right angles** at each of these connections.
- Specifically, $ \angle EKF, \angle FKG, \angle GKH, \angle HKE $ are all right angles.
- Segment $ FK = 32 $ feet.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

The key insight is recognizing that point $ K $ is such that the lines $ KE, KF, KG, KH $ are mutually perpendicular. This happens only in very specific configurations — particularly in **squares**, where the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

Let’s place the rectangle on a coordinate plane for clarity:

- Let $ E = (0, 0) $
- $ F = (a, 0) $
- $ G = (a, b) $
- $ H = (0, b) $

Then the diagonals are:

- $ EG $: from $ (0, 0) $ to $ (a, b) $
- $ FH $: from $ (a, 0) $ to $ (0, b) $

These diagonals intersect at the center of the rectangle, which is the **midpoint** of both diagonals. 

In particular, **if the rectangle is a square**, then the diagonals are not only equal in length but also **perpendicular**. This aligns perfectly with the condition that all angles at $ K $ are right angles.

Thus, **this forces the rectangle to be a square**, i.e., $ a = b $.

---

### Step 2: Coordinates of Point $ K $

Since the diagonals of a square intersect at the center, the coordinates of $ K $ (which satisfies all right-angle conditions) must be the **center** of the square. That is:

$$
K = \left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}\right)
$$

Now compute the distance $ FK $ using the distance formula:

$$
FK = \sqrt{(a - \tfrac{a}{2})^2 + (0 - \tfrac{a}{2})^2} = \sqrt{\left(\tfrac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\tfrac{a}{2}\right)^2}
= \sqrt{\tfrac{a^2}{4} + \tfrac{a^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{a^2}{2}} = \tfrac{a}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Set this equal to 32:

$$
\tfrac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = 32\sqrt{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute Diagonal Length $ EG $

The length of the diagonal $ EG $ in a square is:

$$
EG = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\sqrt{2}
$$

Substituting $ a = 32\sqrt{2} $:

$$
EG = 32\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 32 \cdot 2 = 64
$$
