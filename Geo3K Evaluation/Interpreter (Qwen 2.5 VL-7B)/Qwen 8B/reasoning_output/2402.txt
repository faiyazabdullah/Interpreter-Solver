====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with radius OB, which is perpendicular to chord CD. The length of CD is 24 inches, and we need to find the length of OX, where X is the midpoint of CD. Wait, actually, the problem says that X is the midpoint of CD because it mentions IsMidpointOf(Point(X)). Also, there are some equalities here: LengthOf Line(C,D) equals LengthOf Line(C,X), but since X is the midpoint, that should mean CX = XD, so each half would be 12 inches. But maybe I need to check that again.

Wait, hold on. Let me parse the problem again carefully. 

The problem states:

- Circle O (so center at point O)
- Point O (probably the same as the center)
- Point B (another point on the circle?)
- Line(O,B): This is a radius, since it's mentioned that IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B)), so OB is a radius, hence its length is equal to the radius of the circle, which is given as 13 inches.
- Chord CD: So CD is a chord of the circle, and line CD is the chord.
- IsChordOf(Line(C,D)): Confirms that CD is a chord.
- IsPerpendicular(Line(O,B)): So the radius OB is perpendicular to chord CD. That means OB is perpendicular to CD at their intersection point. Since OB is a radius and CD is a chord, then the perpendicular from the center to the chord bisects the chord. Therefore, the midpoint of CD lies along OB. 

But wait, the problem also mentions IsMidpointOf(Point(X)), so X is the midpoint of CD. Therefore, X lies on OB. Because when a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord, so the midpoint of CD is X, and X lies on OB. 

So, we need to find the length of OX. Given that the radius OB is 13 inches, and CD is 24 inches. 

Let me visualize this. Let me draw a diagram mentally. There's a circle with center O. There's a chord CD of length 24 inches. The radius OB is perpendicular to CD. Since OB is perpendicular to CD and passes through the midpoint X of CD, then triangle OXC is a right triangle? Or maybe triangle OXD?

Wait, since OB is perpendicular to CD at point X, then OX is part of OB. Let me think. Let me denote the midpoint of CD as X. Then, since OB is perpendicular to CD, then X lies on OB. Therefore, OX is the distance from the center O to the midpoint X of chord CD. 

But how do we find OX? Well, we can use the Pythagorean theorem here. In a circle, the distance from the center to the chord (which is OX in this case) can be calculated using the formula: 

If a chord of length l is at distance d from the center, then r² = (l/2)² + d², where r is the radius. 

In this case, our chord CD has length 24 inches, so half of that is 12 inches. The distance from the center O to the chord CD is OX. Therefore, plugging into the formula:

r² = (l/2)² + d²  
=> 13² = 12² + d²  
=> 169 = 144 + d²  
=> d² = 169 - 144 = 25  
=> d = 5 inches.

Therefore, OX is 5 inches. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. 

Alternatively, since OB is the radius, which is 13 inches. If X is the midpoint of CD, then OX is the distance from the center to the chord. However, in this case, the radius OB is perpendicular to CD, so OB intersects CD at X. Therefore, the entire length of OB is split into two parts: OX and XB. But since OB is a radius, its total length is 13 inches. So, if we can find OX, then perhaps we can relate it to XB. 

But since OB is perpendicular to CD at X, then OX is the distance from the center to the chord, which we just calculated as 5 inches. Therefore, OX = 5 inches, making the answer A. 

But wait, let me verify again. Let me think about the right triangle formed. The radius OB is 13 inches. The segment OX is the distance from the center to the chord, which is perpendicular to the chord. The half-length of the chord is 12 inches. So, in the right triangle formed by O, X, and C (or D), we have:

OX^2 + (CD/2)^2 = OB^2  
Which gives OX^2 + 12^2 = 13^2  
So OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25  
Thus, OX = 5 inches. 

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 5, which is option A. 

But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A. 5, B. 12, C. 13, D. 26. So, A is 5. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 

I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing that OX is the distance from the center to the chord, and applying the Pythagorean theorem with half the chord length and the radius.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by identifying the key geometric relationships and applying fundamental theorems related to circles and chords.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are given:

- A circle centered at **O**.
- A **radius** **OB**, which is **perpendicular** to a **chord** **CD**.
- The chord **CD** has a known length of **24 inches**.
- The point **X** is defined as the **midpoint** of **CD**.
- We are asked to find the **length of OX**, i.e., the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord **CD**.

From the property of circles, **a radius drawn perpendicular to a chord always bisects the chord**, meaning the midpoint of the chord lies on the radius. Thus, **OX** is the perpendicular segment from the center **O** to the chord **CD**, and it lies along the radius **OB**.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Right Triangle Relationship**

Since **OX** is perpendicular to **CD**, and **X** is the midpoint of **CD**, we form a **right triangle**:

- One leg is **OX**, the perpendicular from the center to the chord.
- The other leg is **CX**, which is half the length of **CD**:  
  $$
  \text{CX} = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ inches}
  $$
- The hypotenuse is the **radius** **OB**, which is given as **13 inches**.

Now apply the **Pythagorean Theorem** to this right triangle:

$$
\text{(OX)}^2 + (\text{CX})^2 = (\text{OB})^2
$$
$$
\text{(OX)}^2 + 12^2 = 13^2
$$
$$
\text{(OX)}^2 + 144 = 169
$$
$$
\text{(OX)}^2 = 169 - 144 = 25
$$
$$
\text{OX} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of **OX**, the perpendicular from the center to the chord, is **5 inches**. This matches **Answer Choice A**.
