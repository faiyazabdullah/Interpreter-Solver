QUESTION:
Find the measure of \angle 7 if m \angle 4 = m \angle 5.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 7 based on the given information. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the constraints provided. Let me start by listing out all the elements mentioned:

There are points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The triangles mentioned are Triangle(F,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D), Triangle(A,B,D). There's also a Pentagon (A,B,C,D,E). So, the pentagon connects A-B-C-D-E-A? Wait, but there are lines like Line(D,E) and Line(E,D), which might mean that E is connected to D twice? Maybe that's just redundant notation for the same line.

Also, there are several angles defined as Angle(1, F, B, C), Angle(2, E, B, D), Angle(3, A, B, D), Angle(4, A, D, G), Angle(5, A, D, G). And we're told that m∠4 = m∠5. We need to find the measure of ∠7, but wait—where is ∠7 mentioned? Hmm, maybe there's a typo or missing info? Wait, looking back at the question: it says "Find the measure of ∠7 if m∠4 = m∠5." But the original problem didn't mention ∠7. Maybe ∠7 refers to another angle in the diagram?

Wait, perhaps ∠7 is referring to some other angle formed by the intersections? Or maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement? Alternatively, maybe ∠7 is meant to be one of the existing angles but mislabeled? Let me check again.

Looking at the given angles:

Angles listed are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then the question asks about ∠7. That seems odd. Unless there's a missing part in the problem description. Wait, maybe there's more to the diagram that wasn't included here? For example, maybe point G forms another angle with other points, leading to ∠7?

Let me re-examine the given constraints. There's a Line(D,G). Also, Angle(4, A, D, G) and Angle(5, A, D, G). Wait, but angles 4 and 5 are both between A, D, G? That would imply they are the same angle, unless they are different types of angles, like adjacent or something else. However, since their measures are equal, maybe they refer to two different angles that somehow sum up or have a relationship?

Wait, the problem states that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5))). Wait, no—the original problem has:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4))
MeasureOf(Angle(5)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)
... etc."

Wait, perhaps the user made a formatting error. Let me parse the original question again:

The problem includes several Equals statements. The last parts are:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)
MeasureOf(Angle(5)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,A)

So, it seems that MeasureOf(Angle(4)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(5))? Because the way it's written, maybe the first line is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), then next line is MeasureOf(Angle(5)), implying that they are equal? Or maybe there was a formatting issue. Assuming that the problem states that m∠4 = m∠5, which is given. 

But how does this help us find ∠7? Since ∠7 isn't mentioned in the given angles. Maybe there's an error in the problem, or maybe ∠7 refers to another angle formed by intersecting lines?

Alternatively, perhaps there was a mislabeling in the problem. For instance, maybe ∠7 is supposed to be ∠4 or ∠5? Or perhaps it's an angle involving point G, like ∠ADG or something else. Let me think.

Given that there's a line DG, and angles 4 and 5 involve points A, D, G. If angles 4 and 5 are both at point D, but with different sides? Wait, the notation for angles is usually three points, with the middle being the vertex. So Angle(X,Y,Z) means the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(4, A, D, G) would be the angle at D between A and G. Similarly for Angle(5, A, D, G)—but that would be the same angle. So maybe there's a typo here, and perhaps Angle(5) is different? Like maybe Angle(5, D, G, something)? Or maybe the original problem had more angles, and due to formatting issues, only some were shown?

Alternatively, maybe ∠7 refers to another angle formed by the intersection of lines. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

First, points A, B, C, D, E form a pentagon. So connecting A-B-C-D-E-A. But there are additional lines:

- Line(F,B): so F is connected to B.
- Line(B,C): already part of the pentagon.
- Line(E,B): connects E to B.
- Line(B,D): connects B to D.
- Line(A,B): connects A to B.
- Line(D,E): connects D to E (already part of the pentagon).
- Line(E,D): same as above.
- Line(F,A): connects F to A.
- Line(A,D): connects A to D.
- Line(D,G): connects D to G.

Triangles:

- Triangle(F,B,C): Points F, B, C forming a triangle.
- Triangle(E,B,D): Points E, B, D.
- Triangle(A,B,D): Points A, B, D.

Now, considering these connections, let me sketch mentally:

Point B is connected to multiple points: C, D, E, A (since Line(B,C), Line(B,D), Line(B,E), Line(A,B)). Point A is connected to B and D. Point D is connected to B, E, and G. Point E is connected to B and D. Point C is connected to B and F. Point F is connected to B and A. Point G is connected to D.

Now, angles mentioned:

Angle(1, F, B, C): angle at B between F and C. So ∠FBC.

Angle(2, E, B, D): angle at B between E and D. So ∠EBD.

Angle(3, A, B, D): angle at B between A and D. So ∠ABD.

Then, Angles 4 and 5: both are Angle(A, D, G), meaning angle at D between A and G. So ∠ADG. But why are there two angles with the same name? Maybe there's a mistake here, but the problem states that their measures are equal. So maybe those are different angles, but the notation is incorrect? Or perhaps they are vertical angles or supplementary?

Assuming that angles 4 and 5 are both ∠ADG, but since they are equal, that tells us that maybe the line DG creates some symmetry or specific conditions.

Additionally, the lengths of certain segments are equal: LengthOf(Line(B,C)) equals LengthOf(Line(B,D)) equals LengthOf(Line(D,E)) equals LengthOf(Line(F,A)). So BC = BD = DE = FA.

So BC = BD implies that in triangle EBD and triangle BCD (if applicable), perhaps there are congruent triangles?

But let's focus on the angles. Given that BC = BD = DE = FA, which suggests that triangles involving these sides may be isosceles.

Starting with Angle(1) which is ∠FBC. Since FB and BC are connected via point B, and FA equals BC. Wait, FA is equal to BC. So FA = BC. Also, since F is connected to B and A, and A is connected to B. So maybe triangle FBA? If FA = BC, but not sure yet.

Similarly, BD = BC, so BD = BC. Therefore, in triangle BCD, if BD = BC, then triangle BCD is isosceles with base CD and equal sides BC and BD. Wait, but point C is connected to B and D? No, in the pentagon, the order is A-B-C-D-E-A. So point C is connected to B and D? Wait, no. In the pentagon, each consecutive point is connected. So A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, E-A. So yes, C is connected to B and D. Therefore, BC and CD are sides of the pentagon. Wait, but BD is a diagonal. So BD connects B to D, skipping point C.

So in triangle BCD, sides BC and BD are equal. Hence, triangle BCD is isosceles with BC = BD. Therefore, angles opposite these sides should be equal. Wait, BC and BD are the legs, so the base is CD. Thus, the base angles at C and D would be equal. Wait, but angle at C is ∠BCD, and angle at D is ∠BDC. Wait, but in triangle BCD, if BC=BD, then ∠BDC = ∠BCD. But without knowing more about the pentagon, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, focusing on triangle EBD: since BD = DE (given BD = DE), triangle EBD is isosceles with BD = DE. Therefore, angles at E and B are equal. Wait, triangle EBD has vertices E, B, D. Sides BD and DE are equal. Therefore, the base angles at E and B are equal. So ∠BED = ∠EBD. Wait, but ∠EBD is angle 2, which is ∠E, B, D. So angle at B, which is angle 2. Therefore, ∠EBD = ∠BED.

Similarly, in triangle ABD: AB is connected to B and D, and BD is equal to AB? Wait, no. Wait, BD equals BC, which equals DE, which equals FA. But AB is a side of the pentagon. Is AB equal to BD? Not necessarily stated. Wait, but in the problem, the lengths are set as:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,A)

So BC = BD = DE = FA. But AB is not mentioned as equal to these. So AB could be different.

Now, moving to angles:

We have angles 1 (∠FBC), 2 (∠EBD), 3 (∠ABD). These are all angles at point B. So the total around point B?

Since point B is connected to A, C, D, E, and F. So the angles around point B would include:

- Between A and F: ∠ABF?
- Between F and C: ∠FBC (angle 1)
- Between C and D: ∠CBD?
- Between D and E: ∠DBE (which is angle 2?)
Wait, need to clarify the arrangement of the lines at point B.

Lines connected to B:

From the list:

- Line(F,B)
- Line(B,C)
- Line(E,B)
- Line(B,D)
- Line(A,B)

So the lines emanating from B are BA, BF, BE, BD, and BC. Wait, but in the pentagon, B is connected to A and C. Additionally, there are extra lines: BE (from E,B), BD (from B,D), and BF (from F,B).

Therefore, at point B, there are five lines: BA, BF, BE, BD, and BC. So the angles between these lines would be:

Between BA and BF: angle ∠ABF?

Between BF and BC: angle ∠FBC (angle 1)

Between BC and BD: ?

Wait, but BD is connected directly to B. So after BC, the next line would be BD? Or depends on the order of the lines. This is getting complicated. Perhaps we can consider that the angles at B are split into various parts.

Alternatively, since angles 1, 2, 3 are defined:

Angle(1) is ∠FBC: between F and C at B.

Angle(2) is ∠EBD: between E and D at B.

Angle(3) is ∠ABD: between A and D at B.

So these three angles are at point B, but how do they relate to each other?

If we imagine the lines from B:

- BA (connected to A)
- BF (connected to F)
- BC (connected to C)
- BD (connected to D)
- BE (connected to E)

These lines divide the plane around point B into several angles. The angles mentioned are:

- ∠FBC (between F and C)
- ∠EBD (between E and D)
- ∠ABD (between A and D)

But depending on the order of the lines around point B, these angles could overlap or be adjacent. Let me try to arrange them in order.

Assume that the lines from B are arranged in the order: F, A, E, C, D, and BD. Wait, not sure. It's possible that the lines are ordered differently. Without a diagram, this is challenging. However, we can use the fact that angles 1, 2, 3 are present, and possibly others.

Alternatively, consider that in triangle FBC, angle at B is angle 1. In triangle EBD, angle at B is angle 2. In triangle ABD, angle at B is angle 3. These three angles are at point B, and maybe together with other angles, make up the full circle around B.

But the sum of all angles around point B is 360 degrees. So if we can express the sum of these angles plus others, we can find relationships.

But first, let's look at triangles:

In triangle FBC: angles are at F, B, C. We know angle at B is angle 1 (∠FBC). If we can find other angles in this triangle, maybe using the given length relations.

Similarly, in triangle EBD: angle at B is angle 2 (∠EBD). Since BD = DE, as per given lengths (BD = DE), triangle EBD is isosceles with BD = DE, so angles at E and B are equal. Therefore, ∠BED = ∠EBD = angle 2.

In triangle ABD: BD is equal to BC (as given BD = BC). So triangle ABD has sides AB, BD, AD. Wait, BD = BC, but AB is unknown. However, if we assume that AB is related to other sides?

Wait, FA is equal to BC. Since FA = BC, and BC = BD, so FA = BD. So FA = BD.

Now, considering triangle FBA: FA is one side, BA is another, and FB is the third. But without knowing more about the triangle, it's unclear.

But let's go back to angles around point B. Suppose that the angles at B are composed of angles 1, 2, 3, and possibly others.

For example, if the lines from B are arranged as follows: starting from A, going to F, then to C, then to D, then to E, and then back to A? Not sure. Alternatively, think of the pentagon ABCDE, with diagonals added.

Alternatively, since there's a pentagon A-B-C-D-E-A, the internal angles of the pentagon would normally sum to (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. Each internal angle of a regular pentagon is 108 degrees, but this isn't necessarily regular since we have various equal lengths.

However, the given constraints don't state that it's regular, so we can't assume that.

Back to the angles at B. Let's consider that the lines from B are BA, BF, BE, BD, and BC. Depending on the configuration, these lines create several angles around B. Let's suppose that the order of the lines around B is A, F, C, D, E, and back to A. Not sure, but let's proceed.

If we consider that angle 3 is ∠ABD, which is between A and D at B. So that would be the angle between BA and BD. Then angle 2 is ∠EBD, between E and D at B. So that would be between BE and BD. Then angle 1 is ∠FBC, between F and C at B. So between BF and BC.

If we imagine that, then the angles around B would include:

- From A to F: angle between BA and BF.
- From F to C: angle 1 (∠FBC).
- From C to D: ?
- From D to E: angle between BD and BE (which is angle 2? Or maybe angle between BE and BD is angle 2).
Wait, angle 2 is ∠EBD, which is at B between E and D. So between BE and BD. So if you go from E to B to D, that's angle 2.

So putting it all together, the angles around point B are:

- Between BA and BF: let's call it x.
- Between BF and BC: angle 1.
- Between BC and BD: let's call it y.
- Between BD and BE: angle 2.
- Between BE and BA: let's call it z.

But this is speculative. However, if we consider that the total around point B is 360 degrees, then x + angle1 + y + angle2 + z = 360°.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult to determine the relationships between these angles. However, maybe there are other clues.

Another approach: consider the triangles involving point B.

In triangle ABD: AB, BD, AD. Since BD = BC, and FA = BC, so FA = BD. So FA = BD. If we can relate AB to FA?

Wait, FA is the length of segment from F to A. If we consider triangle FBA, with sides FA, AB, and FB. If we can find relationships here, maybe through angles.

But without more information, this is tricky. However, let's recall that angles 4 and 5 are both ∠ADG, and they are equal. So angle at D between A and G. Since there's a line DG, which connects D to G. So point G is somewhere such that when connected to D, creates angle ADG. If angles 4 and 5 are equal, perhaps there's something about triangle ADG or other triangles involving G?

Assuming that angles 4 and 5 are the same, which might suggest that DG bisects some angle, or that triangle ADG is isosceles. For example, if angle 4 and 5 are the same, maybe DG is the angle bisector of ∠ADG, making it symmetric. Or maybe there are two angles at D that are equal because of some construction.

Wait, but if angles 4 and 5 are both ∠ADG, then they would be the same angle, so their measures would be equal regardless. That suggests there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps angle 5 is meant to be a different angle, like ∠AGD or ∠GDA? Or maybe the problem intended to have different angles, like ∠ADG and ∠GDG or something else? This uncertainty makes solving it difficult.

Alternatively, assuming that angles 4 and 5 are different angles at point D, but both involving point G. For example, angle 4 is ∠ADG and angle 5 is ∠GD something. Let me check the original problem again:

The angles mentioned are:

Angle(4, A, D, G) and Angle(5, A, D, G). So both are at point D between A and G. Which would make them the same angle, hence their measures are equal. But the problem states that they are equal, which is trivially true. So this suggests that there's a typo, and maybe angle 5 is meant to be a different angle, such as ∠GDA or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is ∠DGA, which would be a different angle at G. But without knowing the exact definition, it's hard to tell.

This confusion about angles 4 and 5 makes it hard to proceed. However, since the problem mentions that m∠4 = m∠5, and asks for ∠7, which hasn't been defined, I'm likely missing something.

Wait, maybe ∠7 is the angle at G, or another angle formed by the lines? For example, if there's a triangle involving G, like triangle ADG, then maybe ∠AGD or ∠GAD? Or maybe ∠7 is referring to ∠FGA or another angle?

Alternatively, maybe the problem originally had more angles labeled 1-7, and due to formatting errors, only some are present. Assuming that ∠7 is another angle formed by the intersections, maybe in triangle ADG or elsewhere.

Let me try to focus on what we know:

Given that BD = BC = DE = FA, and the triangles involved.

In triangle EBD, since BD = DE, it's isosceles with ∠EBD = ∠BED (angle 2). Let's denote angle 2 as α. Then ∠BED = α.

In triangle BCD, since BC = BD, it's isosceles with ∠BCD = ∠BDC. Let's denote ∠BCD = β, so ∠BDC = β.

Now, in the pentagon ABCDE, the sum of its internal angles is 540°. Each internal angle can be expressed in terms of other angles.

But without knowing the specific shape, this is complex. However, let's consider that the pentagon is made up of the points A-B-C-D-E-A, with some diagonals.

Alternatively, consider that the angles at each vertex of the pentagon are influenced by the triangles and other constructions.

For example, at point C, the internal angle of the pentagon would involve ∠BCD (β) and ∠BCA? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple triangles, perhaps we can find expressions for angles 1, 2, 3.

Let's consider angle 1 (∠FBC). In triangle FBC, we have sides FB, BC, FC. We know BC = BD = DE = FA. But without knowing FB or FC, it's hard to say. However, if FA = BC, and FA is a side of triangle FBA, which has sides FA, AB, and FB. If we assume that triangle FBA is isosceles or something?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles 1, 2, 3, and the internal angles of the pentagon.

Wait, let's think about the angles at point B again. If we can find the sum of angles around B, which is 360°, and express them in terms of known quantities.

Suppose that at point B, the angles are:

- ∠ABF (let's call it x)
- ∠FBC (angle 1)
- ∠CBD (let's call it y)
- ∠EBD (angle 2)
- ∠DBA (which is angle 3?)

Wait, angle 3 is ∠ABD, which would be the angle between A and D at B. So that would be from BA to BD. So if we have BA, then BD, so the angle between BA and BD is angle 3.

So if we break down the angles around B, it would depend on how the lines are arranged. Assume that the lines from B are in the order: BA, BF, BC, BD, BE.

So the angles would be:

- Between BA and BF: x
- Between BF and BC: angle 1
- Between BC and BD: let's say angle CBD (y)
- Between BD and BE: angle 2
- Between BE and BA: z

Total: x + angle1 + y + angle2 + z = 360°

But without more info, it's still too many variables.

But we know that in triangle BCD, which has BC = BD, so ∠BCD = ∠BDC = β. Let's see if we can relate β to other angles.

At point C, the internal angle of the pentagon would involve ∠BCD (β) and other angles. Similarly, at point D, the internal angle involves ∠BDC (β) and ∠EDC, etc.

But this seems too vague. Let's try another approach.

Since FA = BC, and FA is a side connected to F and A. If we consider triangle FBA, with FA = BC, and if we can relate it to other triangles.

Wait, maybe there's a reflection or symmetry. For example, if FA = BC, and BC = BD, then FA = BD. So FA = BD. So triangle FBA and triangle BDA might have some relation?

Wait, BD is a side in triangle BDA, and FA is a side in triangle FBA. If FA = BD, and if AB is common to both triangles? No, AB is in triangle FBA, but BD is in triangle ABD. Not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ABD, with BD = BC, and FA = BC, so FA = BD. If we can find some relationship between triangles ABD and FBA.

Alternatively, since we have angles 1, 2, 3, which are at point B, and we might be able to find their measures through the isosceles triangles.

For example, in triangle EBD, which is isosceles with BD = DE, so ∠EBD = ∠BED = angle 2. Let's denote angle 2 as α. Then in triangle EBD, the third angle at E is α, and the remaining angle at D is 180° - 2α.

Similarly, in triangle BCD, which is isosceles with BC = BD, so ∠BCD = ∠BDC = β. So in triangle BCD, angles at C and D are β, and the angle at B is 180° - 2β.

But what is the angle at B in triangle BCD? That would be ∠CBD, which is part of the angles around point B. So if ∠CBD = 180° - 2β.

Now, let's consider the angles around point B. Let's assume that the angles at B are:

- ∠ABD (angle 3) = ?
- ∠EBD (angle 2) = α
- ∠FBC (angle 1) = ?
- And possibly others.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to proceed. However, let's try to consider that the angles at B are composed of angle 1, angle 2, and angle 3, along with other angles.

Wait, if angle 3 is ∠ABD, which is between A and D at B. So that would encompass the angle from BA to BD. If we assume that the other angles at B are angle 1 (∠FBC) and angle 2 (∠EBD), then the total around B would include angle 3 plus angle 1 and angle 2, plus other angles.

But this is still too vague. Perhaps we can find relationships between the angles.

Let me consider that in triangle ABD, since BD = BC, and if we can relate it to other triangles.

Alternatively, think about the entire structure. Since BC = BD = DE = FA, and the pentagon has these equal lengths, maybe it's a special kind of pentagon.

Alternatively, let's consider that the sum of angles at B: if we can express it in terms of α and β.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to focus on the angles 4 and 5, even though their definitions are unclear. If they are both ∠ADG, then their equality is trivial. But since the problem says they are equal, perhaps this implies that DG is parallel to something, or creates an isosceles triangle.

If ∠ADG is equal to itself, it doesn't give new info. So maybe there's a typo, and angle 5 is meant to be ∠AGD or ∠GAD. Let's assume that angle 5 is ∠AGD, which would be a different angle at G. If so, and given that ∠4 = ∠5, then in triangle ADG, we have two angles equal, making it isosceles. For example, if ∠ADG = ∠AGD, then AD = AG. Or if ∠ADG = ∠GAD, then DG = AG.

But without knowing the exact definition of angle 5, it's hard to proceed. However, since the problem asks for ∠7, which we don't know about, maybe it's referring to one of these angles.

Assuming that ∠7 is ∠AGD (angle 5), and since ∠4 = ∠5, then in triangle ADG, ∠ADG = ∠AGD, making it isosceles with AD = AG. Or if ∠4 and ∠5 are base angles, then AD = AG.

But without knowing the exact location of G, it's hard to say. However, since there's a line DG, and G is a point connected to D, maybe triangle ADG has some properties.

If we assume that ∠4 = ∠5, and they are angles at D and G respectively, then perhaps there's a relationship between sides or other angles.

Alternatively, if ∠4 and ∠5 are both at D, then they would be the same angle, which doesn't help. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Given the time I've spent and lack of progress on angles 4 and 5, perhaps I should focus on other parts.

Let me revisit the initial goal: find ∠7, given that ∠4 = ∠5. Since I can't resolve the ambiguity about ∠4 and ∠5, maybe I should assume that ∠7 is one of the standard angles in the diagram, like ∠AFB or ∠FBA, and try to calculate it using the given information.

Alternatively, since the answer choices are numerical (63, 64, 69, 89), and the problem involves isosceles triangles and equal lengths, maybe the measure of ∠7 is derived from the sum of angles in a triangle or pentagon.

Let me try to consider that the pentagon ABCDE has certain properties. Since BC = BD = DE = FA, and assuming that it's a type of pentagon with symmetries.

For example, if BC = BD, then triangle BCD is isosceles, as before. Similarly, DE = BD, so triangle BDE is isosceles.

Let me try to assign variables to angles.

Let's define:

- In triangle EBD (isosceles with BD = DE), let ∠EBD = ∠BED = α. So the third angle at D is 180° - 2α.

- In triangle BCD (isosceles with BC = BD), let ∠BCD = ∠BDC = β. So the third angle at B is 180° - 2β.

Now, in the pentagon ABCDE, the internal angles at C and D would involve these angles.

At point C, the internal angle of the pentagon would be ∠BCD (β) plus any other angles from the pentagon. Wait, the internal angle at C is ∠BCD, because the pentagon has sides BC and CD. Wait, no. In a pentagon, each internal angle is formed by two adjacent sides. At point C, the sides are BC and CD, so the internal angle is ∠BCD, which is β.

At point D, the internal angle of the pentagon is formed by sides CD and DE. The angle at D is ∠CDE. But in triangle BDE, we have ∠BDE = 180° - 2α. But ∠BDE is part of the angle at D in the pentagon. Wait, ∠CDE is the internal angle at D, which would be composed of ∠BDE (from triangle BDE) and ∠BDC (from triangle BCD). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

At point D, the internal angle of the pentagon is between CD and DE. But in addition, there is a diagonal BD connecting to B, creating other angles. So the internal angle at D is ∠CDE, but in the presence of diagonal BD, it's divided into ∠BDE and ∠BDC.

Wait, ∠CDE is the internal angle at D of the pentagon. This angle is composed of ∠BDE (from triangle BDE) and ∠BDC (from triangle BCD). So:

∠CDE = ∠BDE + ∠BDC = (180° - 2α) + β.

But in a pentagon, the sum of internal angles is 540°, so if we can write equations for each internal angle.

Let's try to write the internal angles:

- At A: ? 
- At B: ?
- At C: β
- At D: (180° - 2α) + β
- At E: ?

But we don't know the internal angles at A and E. However, we might be able to find relationships.

Also, note that the sum of all internal angles is 540°, so:

∠A + ∠B + β + [(180° - 2α) + β] + ∠E = 540°

But this introduces more variables.

Alternatively, let's consider the angles at point B. Earlier, we had in triangle BCD, the angle at B is ∠CBD = 180° - 2β. This angle is part of the angles around point B.

Also, in triangle EBD, the angle at B is α (angle 2). And in triangle FBC, angle at B is angle 1.

If we can express the total angles around point B, which is 360°, as the sum of these angles and others.

Assuming that at point B, the angles are:

- ∠ABF (let's call it x)
- ∠FBC (angle 1)
- ∠CBD (180° - 2β)
- ∠EBD (α)
- ∠DBA (angle 3)

Wait, angle 3 is ∠ABD, which is between A and D at B. So if ∠ABD is part of the angles around B, it would be from BA to BD. So if we have BA, then BD, so the angle between them is angle 3.

But how does this fit with the other angles?

Assuming that the lines from B are in the order: BA, BF, BC, BD, BE. Then the angles around B would be:

- Between BA and BF: x
- Between BF and BC: angle 1
- Between BC and BD: 180° - 2β
- Between BD and BE: α
- Between BE and BA: z

Summing these: x + angle1 + (180° - 2β) + α + z = 360°

But without knowing x, angle1, β, α, or z, it's still too many variables.

However, if we can find relationships between these variables.

For example, in triangle FBC, we have angle at B is angle1, and sides BC and BF. If FA = BC, and FA is connected to F and A, perhaps triangle FBA has some relationship.

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try to assume some values or find relationships.

Let's assume that the pentagon is symmetric in some way. For example, if BC = BD = DE = FA, and assuming that some angles are equal.

Let me suppose that α = β, for simplicity. Let's see where that leads.

If α = β, then in triangle BCD, ∠CBD = 180° - 2β = 180° - 2α.

And in triangle EBD, ∠BDE = 180° - 2α.

Now, the angle at D in the pentagon is ∠CDE = (180° - 2α) + β = (180° - 2α) + α = 180° - α.

If we assume that the pentagon is convex, each internal angle is less than 180°, so 180° - α < 180° => α > 0, which is true.

Now, let's consider the sum of all internal angles.

Assume that at point A, the internal angle is some value, say γ, and at point E, it's δ.

So:

γ + ∠B + β + (180° - α) + δ = 540°

But we still have too many variables.

Alternatively, let's consider that the angles at B, C, D, E, A are related to the triangles.

At point C: internal angle is β.

At point D: internal angle is 180° - α.

At point B: let's say the internal angle is the sum of some angles. If we consider that the internal angle at B is composed of angle3 (∠ABD) and other angles.

Wait, the internal angle at B in the pentagon is formed by sides AB and BE. Wait, no, the pentagon is A-B-C-D-E-A, so at point B, the sides are AB and BC. But there are other lines from B to D and E, so the internal angle at B is still between AB and BC, but with other lines creating smaller angles.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to take a different approach.

Let me recall that the problem gives us that m∠4 = m∠5, and asks for ∠7. Since I cannot resolve the ambiguity about angles 4 and 5, perhaps the answer is derived from the assumption that ∠7 is the external angle or something related to the isosceles triangles.

Given the answer choices are close to 60°, 63°, 64°, 69°, 89°, and considering common angles in geometry problems, perhaps ∠7 is 63°, 64°, or similar.

Alternatively, if we consider that in isosceles triangles, the base angles are equal, and the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, maybe there's a calculation that leads to one of these answers.

Let me try to make an educated guess. If we assume that the sum of angles around point B is 360°, and if we can express it in terms of α and β.

Earlier, I assumed α = β, leading to some expressions. Let's try to continue with that.

If α = β, then at point D, the internal angle is 180° - α.

Let's also assume that the internal angle at C is β = α.

Now, let's try to find the internal angle at B. In the pentagon, the internal angle at B is formed by sides AB and BC. But with the additional lines from B to D and E, this angle is divided into smaller angles.

If we consider that the internal angle at B is composed of angle3 (∠ABD) and angle2 (∠EBD = α), and possibly others.

Assuming that the internal angle at B is ∠ABC, which in the pentagon is between AB and BC. But with the diagonal BD, this angle is divided into ∠ABD (angle3) and ∠DBC. Wait, ∠DBC is part of triangle BCD, which we said was 180° - 2β = 180° - 2α.

So the internal angle at B in the pentagon is ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC = angle3 + (180° - 2α).

But ∠ABC is also part of the pentagon's internal angle at B. Let's denote it as θ.

So θ = angle3 + (180° - 2α).

But we also know that in triangle ABD, which has sides AB, BD, AD. If we can find angle3, which is ∠ABD.

In triangle ABD, the angles are at A, B, D. Let's denote:

- ∠ABD = angle3
- ∠BAD = let's say φ
- ∠ADB = let's say ψ

So angle3 + φ + ψ = 180°.

But without knowing φ or ψ, it's still too vague.

However, if we assume that DA is equal to something, or if there's a relationship between DA and other sides.

Given that FA = BC = BD, and FA is connected to F and A, maybe triangle FBA has some relationship.

If FA = BD, and if we can relate it to other sides.

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common angles.

If the answer choices are 63, 64, 69, 89, and assuming that the measure of ∠7 is derived from isosceles triangles and supplementary angles, it's possible that ∠7 is 63° or 64°, which are close to 60°, a common angle in equilateral triangles.

Alternatively, if the problem involves supplementary angles, like 180° - 2*58 = 64°, which is option B.

Given that, I'll choose option B, 64°, as a plausible answer.
