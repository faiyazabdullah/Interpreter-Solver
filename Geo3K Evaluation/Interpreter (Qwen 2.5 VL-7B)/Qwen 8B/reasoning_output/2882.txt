<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So we have a cyclic quadrilateral GJKH. The points G, J, K, H are vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral. Also, there's a point L mentioned, but I'm not sure yet how that comes into play. Wait, the lines are given as Line(G,J), Line(J,K), Line(K,H), Line(H,G). So that makes sense for a quadrilateral. 

The angles mentioned are Angle(G,J,K) which would be angle at point J between points G, J, K. Then MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)) and MeasureOf(Angle(KJH)). Wait, Angle(KJH) – that's angle at point J between points K, J, H? Or maybe it's angle at point H? Let me clarify. The notation Angle(KJH) means the angle at point J between points K, J, H. Because in angle ABC, the middle letter is the vertex. So yes, angle KJH is the angle at J between K and H. Wait, but then the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)) and MeasureOf(Angle(KJH))... so those two angles both at point J?

Wait, but since the quadrilateral is cyclic, meaning all its vertices lie on a circle. In cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. But here, we might need to use some properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals. Also, the problem says GH ≅ KJ. So the length of segment GH is equal to the length of segment KJ. Hmm.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points G, J, K, H forming a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me think about the angles. Since it's cyclic, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. However, the angles mentioned here are adjacent angles at point J. Wait, angle at J (from GJK) and angle at J (from KJH)? Wait, but angle GJK is angle at J between G-J-K. And angle KJH is angle at J between K-J-H. So together, these two angles form a straight line? Wait, because if you look at the quadrilateral, the sides at point J are JG and JK (for angle GJK) and then JH and JK (for angle KJH)? Wait, no. Wait, the quadrilateral is G-J-K-H-G. So the sides are GJ, JK, KH, HG. Therefore, at point J, the two adjacent sides are GJ and JK. So angle at J is between GJ and JK. But then angle KJH is another angle at J? Wait, but point H is connected to K and G. Wait, the angle KJH would involve points K, J, H. So that's angle at J between K and H. Wait, but in the quadrilateral, after point K comes H. So the side from K to H. So the angle at J is between GJ and JK, but angle KJH is part of triangle KJH? Maybe I need to consider triangles within the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of those two angles relates to something. Let me think again. If the quadrilateral is cyclic, then the sum of angles at J and angle at H should be 180 degrees, because they are opposite angles. Wait, but the question mentions the sum of angle GJK (which is angle at J) and angle KJH (also angle at J?), but wait, angle KJH is also at J? That can't be unless those angles are adjacent. Wait, but if you have quadrilateral G-J-K-H-G, then at point J, the internal angle is formed by sides GJ and JK. However, angle KJH would be the angle at J between KJ and HJ? Wait, H is connected to J? No, H is connected to K and G. Wait, the sides are GJ, JK, KH, HG. So from J, the sides are GJ and JK. From H, the sides are KH and HG. So point H is connected to K and G. Therefore, the angle at J is between GJ and JK. The angle KJH is the angle at J between KJ and HJ. Wait, but H is not directly connected to J. Unless there's a diagonal? Wait, maybe there's a diagonal connecting J to H? But the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, the problem statement includes Point(L), but I don't see where that comes in. Maybe it's a typo or maybe there's more information missing? Alternatively, maybe the angle KJH refers to angle at H? Let me check the notation again. Angle(KJH) is written as Angle(KJH), which should mean the angle at point J between points K, J, H. So that's the same as angle at J between KJ and HJ. But if there is no such segment HJ, then this angle isn't part of the quadrilateral. Wait, unless there's a diagonal from H to J. But the problem didn't state that. Hmm, maybe there's a misinterpretation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle KJH is referring to angle at H? Like, maybe a typo? For example, if it was Angle(JKH), that would make sense. But assuming the notation is correct, Angle(KJH) is the angle at J. So, in the quadrilateral, if we consider triangle KJH, but H is connected to K and G. So maybe there's a diagonal from J to H, making triangle JKH? If that's the case, then angle KJH is part of that triangle. But the problem didn't specify any diagonals, so maybe that's an assumption we need to make?

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a diagram that's not included here, and without seeing the diagram, we have to infer based on standard notations. Given that GH ≅ KJ, which are two sides. So GH and KJ are congruent. Let me note that down. GH = KJ.

Now, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, we can apply properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. For instance, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to sums of products of opposite sides, but that's Ptolemy's theorem. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that opposite angles are supplementary. Wait, but the problem is giving us angles at point J. Let me think again about the angles.

If we consider angle GJK (angle at J between G and K) and angle KJH (angle at J between K and H). Wait, if there is a diagonal from J to H, then those two angles would add up to the total angle at J. Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle is determined by the arcs. However, if there's a diagonal from J to H, then angle GJK and angle KJH could be adjacent angles adding up to the total angle at J. But in reality, in a quadrilateral, each vertex only has one internal angle. So if angle GJK is the internal angle at J, then why is there another angle KJH mentioned? This suggests that maybe there's a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the internal angles of the quadrilateral but about angles formed by certain lines. Let me re-express:

Given that the quadrilateral is cyclic (so all four points lie on a circle), and we have lines GJ, JK, KH, HG. Angles mentioned are:

- MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)): this is angle at J between segments GJ and JK. So that's the internal angle at J of the quadrilateral.

- MeasureOf(Angle(KJH)): this is angle at J between segments KJ and HJ. But since there's no segment HJ mentioned, unless there's a diagonal from J to H. Assuming that, then this angle would be part of triangle KJH. But without knowing if that diagonal exists, it's hard to proceed.

But given that the problem gives GH ≅ KJ, which are two sides of the quadrilateral. Let me think about the possible relationships. If GH and KJ are congruent, and the quadrilateral is cyclic, maybe there's some symmetry or specific properties we can exploit.

Alternatively, considering triangle KJH. If there is a diagonal from J to H, then triangle KJH would have sides KJ, JH, and KH. But without knowing more about the triangle, maybe we can relate angles. However, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the angle at J (internal angle) plus angle at H (internal angle) equals 180 degrees. But angle at J is the internal angle, which would include angle GJK. Wait, but if there's a diagonal from J to H, then the internal angle at J would split into two angles: angle GJK and angle KJH. So their sum would be the internal angle at J. But in that case, if we have that sum, and if we know something else...

Wait, the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)), MeasureOf(Angle(KJH))). So that sum would be the measure of the internal angle at J. But in a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angle at J plus the internal angle at H equals 180 degrees. But we don't know anything about angle at H. However, if we can find that sum, maybe through other relations.

But we also know that GH ≅ KJ. Let's denote GH = KJ. Let me assign variables. Let me call GH = KJ = x. Wait, but the problem asks to find x. Wait, the question says "Find x." But where is x defined? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The user hasn't specified what x represents. Wait, the problem mentions "Find x," but the initial description didn't define x. Wait, maybe x is the measure of the sum of the angles? Or perhaps x is the measure of one of the angles? Wait, the problem might have been cut off. Wait, checking again:

Original problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:

QUESTION:
G H \cong K J. Find x."

Ah! Wait, the question is asking to find x, but it's unclear what x is. Perhaps x is the measure of the sum of those two angles? Or maybe x is the measure of one of the angles? Since the answer choices are numerical values (like 27, 54, etc.), likely x is an angle measure. But the problem statement is incomplete. However, given that the answer choices are numbers, and the context involves cyclic quadrilaterals and congruent sides, maybe x is the measure of one of the angles involved.

Wait, perhaps there was a formatting issue. Let me parse the original question again:

"QUESTION:
G H \cong K J. Find x."

Possibly, the problem originally had an image or more text, but due to formatting issues, parts are missing. For example, maybe the question was supposed to say "GH ≅ KJ. Find the measure of angle x", where x is an angle in the figure. But since the user hasn't provided that, we have to infer based on the given info.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to common cyclic quadrilateral problems where given two sides are congruent, and angles are involved, leading to solving for an angle measure. Let me assume that x is the measure of one of the angles mentioned. For instance, if the sum of the two angles mentioned is x, or one of them.

Assuming that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)) and MeasureOf(Angle(KJH)) is x. But in that case, since those two angles are at point J, if there's a diagonal from J to H, their sum would be the internal angle at J. And since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the internal angle at J plus the internal angle at H equals 180 degrees. But without knowing angle at H, we can't directly compute.

However, if GH ≅ KJ, which are two sides of the quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, if two sides are congruent, perhaps there are some symmetries. For example, if GH = KJ, then maybe the arcs subtended by these chords are equal, implying that the angles subtended by them are equal. Wait, in a circle, congruent chords subtend congruent arcs. So arc GH and arc KJ would be congruent. Therefore, the central angles over these arcs would be equal. However, how does this relate to the angles at J?

Alternatively, maybe triangle GHJ and triangle KJH have some relation. Wait, but I need more concrete steps.

Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, since GH ≅ KJ, then in the cyclic quadrilateral GJKH, sides GH and KJ are congruent. Let's recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides (Ptolemy's theorem): GH * JK + GK * HJ = GJ * HK. Wait, but without knowing more about the sides, this may not help immediately.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ, let's denote GH = KJ = a. Let me denote the sides:

In cyclic quadrilateral GJKH, the sides are GJ, JK, KH, HG. Given that GH = KJ, so GH = JK. So GH = JK. Therefore, sides GH and JK are equal.

Now, in a cyclic quadrilateral, if two sides are equal, does that imply something about the angles? For example, if GH = JK, then the arcs subtended by GH and JK are equal. Hence, the inscribed angles subtended by these arcs would be equal. However, I need to connect this to the angles at J.

Alternatively, considering the angles at J and H. Since GH = JK, maybe there's some relationship between the angles at J and H. For example, if GH = JK, then the arcs subtended by GH and JK are equal. Arc GH and arc JK are subtended by chords GH and JK. Thus, their measures are equal. Let me denote arc GH = arc JK = α.

Then, the remaining arcs would be arc GJ and arc KH. Let me denote arc GJ = β and arc KH = γ. Since the total circumference is 360°, we have α + α + β + γ = 360° ⇒ 2α + β + γ = 360°.

Now, the internal angle at J in the cyclic quadrilateral is half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the opposite angles. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an internal angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two opposite angles. Wait, no—actually, the formula for an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But for a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle is half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the opposite angles. Wait, let me recall:

For a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two opposite angles. Wait, no. Actually, each internal angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, let me think carefully.

Take angle at J. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at J is formed by chords GJ and JK. The intercepted arcs are arc GK (opposite arc) and the rest. Wait, actually, the measure of angle J is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, the formula is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But angle at J intercepts arc GK. Wait, no. When you have angle at J, it intercepts arc from G to K that doesn't contain J. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at J intercepts arc GK. Therefore, the measure of angle J is half the measure of arc GK.

Similarly, angle at H intercepts arc GJ. So measure of angle H is half the measure of arc GJ.

Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, arc GK + arc GJ = arc GJK. Wait, maybe I need to express the arcs properly.

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

Arc GJ: from G to J along the circumference.

Arc JK: from J to K.

Arc KH: from K to H.

Arc HG: from H to G.

Total circumference: arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = 360°.

But earlier, we said that arc GH = arc JK. Wait, arc GH would be from G to H. Wait, arc GH is composed of arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, arc GH is from G to H directly. Depending on the direction. Wait, if the quadrilateral is ordered G-J-K-H-G, then the arcs are:

From G to J: arc GJ.

From J to K: arc JK.

From K to H: arc KH.

From H to G: arc HG.

So arc GH would be arc from G to H going through the other way around the circle, which would be arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH. Wait, but arc GH is typically considered as the shorter arc unless specified otherwise. But since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the arcs corresponding to the sides are the ones that are less than 180°, I suppose.

But since GH and JK are sides of the quadrilateral, their respective arcs would be arc GH and arc JK. Earlier, we said arc GH = arc JK because GH ≅ KJ. Wait, but arc GH corresponds to chord GH, and arc JK corresponds to chord JK. Since GH ≅ JK, their arcs are congruent, hence arc GH = arc JK.

Therefore, arc GH = arc JK = α.

Then, the other arcs: arc GJ and arc KH. Let me call arc GJ = β and arc KH = γ. So total circumference:

arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = 360°. Wait, but arc HG is the same as arc GH? No. Wait, arc HG is from H to G, which is the same as arc GH but in the opposite direction. So arc GH and arc HG are the same arc, just traversed in reverse. So if arc GH is α, then arc HG is also α. Wait, but that would imply that arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = β + α + γ + α = β + 2α + γ = 360°. Which matches our previous equation.

Now, angle at J is half the measure of arc opposite to it. What's the arc opposite to angle J? In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at J is opposite to the angle at H. The arc opposite to angle J is arc GKH, which is arc GK. Wait, no. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Angle at J intercepts arc GK. Because when you draw angle at J, it's formed by chords GJ and JK, so the intercepted arc is the arc from G to K that doesn't pass through J. So arc GK. Similarly, angle at H is formed by chords KH and HG, so it intercepts arc KG. Wait, no, angle at H is formed by chords KH and HG. So intercepted arc is arc KJ? Wait, no. Let me visualize.

At point H, the angle is formed by sides KH and HG. So the intercepted arc is arc from K to G that doesn't pass through H. Which would be arc KJ + arc JG, i.e., arc KJG. Wait, but arc KJ is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, maybe I need to better define the arcs.

Alternatively, since angle at J intercepts arc GK, then its measure is (arc GK)/2. Similarly, angle at H intercepts arc GJ, so its measure is (arc GJ)/2.

Wait, if that's true, then angle at J = (arc GK)/2, and angle at H = (arc GJ)/2.

But arc GK is equal to arc GJ + arc JK. Since arc GJ is β, arc JK is α, so arc GK = β + α. Therefore, angle at J = (β + α)/2.

Similarly, angle at H = arc GJ / 2 = β/2.

Also, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the sum of angle J and angle H is 180°, because they are opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral. So:

(angle J) + (angle H) = (β + α)/2 + β/2 = (β + α + β)/2 = (2β + α)/2 = β + α/2 = 180°.

Hmm. Not sure if this helps yet. Now, let's look at the angles mentioned in the problem: angle GJK and angle KJH. 

Angle GJK is the angle at J between GJ and JK, which we already said is equal to angle J, which is (β + α)/2.

Angle KJH is the angle at J between KJ and HJ. Wait, but there's no segment HJ unless we assume a diagonal. Assuming there is a diagonal from J to H, then angle KJH would be part of triangle KJH. But in that case, angle KJH is at J between KJ and HJ. So this angle would be part of triangle KJH, whose other angles are at K and H.

But since the quadrilateral is cyclic, point H lies on the circle, so triangle KJH is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, angle at J (KJH) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc KH. Wait, if we consider angle KJH, it intercepts arc KH. Because in triangle KJH, angle at J intercepts arc KH. So measure of angle KJH is (arc KH)/2 = γ/2.

Therefore, the sum of angle GJK (which is angle J, (β + α)/2) and angle KJH (γ/2) is:

(β + α)/2 + γ/2 = (β + α + γ)/2.

But from earlier, we had 2α + β + γ = 360°, so β + γ = 360° - 2α.

Substituting into the above expression:

(β + α + γ)/2 = [(360° - 2α) + α]/2 = (360° - α)/2 = 180° - α/2.

So the sum of the two angles is 180° - α/2.

But what is α? Recall that α is the measure of arc GH and arc JK. Since GH and JK are congruent chords, their arcs are equal. But how do we find α?

Well, we need more information. Let me recall that in the cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have:

arc GH = arc JK = α,

arc GJ = β,

arc KH = γ.

And we also have arc GH = α, arc JK = α.

But we need to relate these to the given condition GH ≅ KJ, which we've already used to set arc GH = arc JK.

Is there another relation? Well, perhaps using triangle properties or other angles?

Wait, but we also know that angle at H is β/2, as established earlier. But we might not have enough info yet.

Alternatively, maybe there's something about triangle KJH. Since we have angle KJH = γ/2, and if we can find another relation involving γ.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ, which are chords of the circle. The length of a chord is related to its subtended arc. Specifically, longer chords correspond to larger arcs. But since GH = KJ, their subtended arcs are equal, so arc GH = arc JK = α.

Now, what's the relationship between other arcs?

We have:

arc GJ = β,

arc JK = α,

arc KH = γ,

arc HG = α (since arc GH = α).

Wait, arc HG is the same as arc GH, right? So arc HG = arc GH = α.

Thus, the total circumference is arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = β + α + γ + α = β + 2α + γ = 360°.

But we need another equation. Let's think about the other angles. We also have angle at J being (β + α)/2, and angle at H being β/2. Earlier, we had angle J + angle H = 180°, so:

(β + α)/2 + β/2 = 180° → (β + α + β)/2 = 180° → (2β + α)/2 = 180° → 2β + α = 360°.

So we have:

Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°.

Equation 2: β + 2α + γ = 360°.

Wait, Equation 2 is from the total circumference, which is β + 2α + γ = 360°.

But we have two equations:

From Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°.

From Equation 2: β + 2α + γ = 360°.

But we have three variables: β, α, γ. Need more info.

Perhaps we can find another relationship. Let me think about angle at K or angle at G.

Alternatively, consider that the sum of all internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum is still 360°, and the sum of opposite angles is 180°. So angle J + angle H = 180°, angle K + angle G = 180°.

But we might not know those angles. Alternatively, if we consider triangle KJH, which has angles at K, J, H. We know angle at J is γ/2 (as per earlier), and if we can find other angles.

Wait, in triangle KJH, the sum of angles is 180°. So angle at J (γ/2) + angle at K + angle at H = 180°. But what are those angles?

Angle at K in triangle KJH is the angle at K between J and H. In the quadrilateral, angle at K is formed by sides JK and KH. So angle at K in the quadrilateral is the internal angle, which is half the measure of arc JH. Wait, similar to before. The internal angle at K intercepts arc JH. So measure of angle K is (arc JH)/2.

Arc JH is arc from J to H, which would be arc JK + arc KH = α + γ. So angle at K in the quadrilateral is (α + γ)/2.

Similarly, angle at H in the quadrilateral is β/2, as established earlier.

But in triangle KJH, the angle at H would be the same as the internal angle at H of the quadrilateral? Or is it different? Let me think. In triangle KJH, the angle at H is formed by sides KH and HJ. Whereas the internal angle at H of the quadrilateral is formed by sides KH and HG. So unless HJ is aligned with HG, which it might not be. Hence, the angle at H in triangle KJH is different from the internal angle at H of the quadrilateral.

This seems complicated. Let me try to focus on what we can get from the triangle KJH.

In triangle KJH, angles are:

- At J: γ/2 (as established),

- At K: let's call it θ,

- At H: let's call it φ.

So θ + φ + γ/2 = 180°.

But what is θ and φ? Let's try to find expressions for them.

Angle at K in triangle KJH is the angle between KJ and KH. In the quadrilateral, the internal angle at K is between JK and KH, which is the same as angle in the triangle KJH at K. Wait, no. Wait, in the quadrilateral, the internal angle at K is between sides JK and KH, which is exactly the angle in triangle KJH at K. So angle at K in triangle KJH is the same as the internal angle at K of the quadrilateral. Which we previously said is (arc JH)/2 = (arc JK + arc KH)/2 = (α + γ)/2.

Therefore, angle at K in triangle KJH is (α + γ)/2.

Similarly, angle at H in triangle KJH is the angle between KH and HJ. In the quadrilateral, the internal angle at H is between KH and HG, which is different from the angle between KH and HJ. So angle at H in triangle KJH is different from internal angle at H.

But since triangle KJH is inscribed in the circle, angle at H (φ) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc KJ. Arc KJ is α. So measure of angle φ is α/2.

Therefore, in triangle KJH:

θ + φ + γ/2 = 180°,

where θ = (α + γ)/2,

φ = α/2.

So substituting:

(α + γ)/2 + α/2 + γ/2 = 180°,

Combine terms:

[(α + γ)/2 + α/2] + γ/2 = ?

Wait, let me calculate:

First term: (α + γ)/2,

Second term: α/2,

Third term: γ/2.

Adding first and second terms: (α + γ + α)/2 = (2α + γ)/2.

Add third term: (2α + γ)/2 + γ/2 = (2α + γ + γ)/2 = (2α + 2γ)/2 = α + γ.

So α + γ = 180°.

So from this, we have α + γ = 180°.

Earlier, we had from Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°, and from Equation 2: β + 2α + γ = 360°.

Now, we know α + γ = 180°, so Equation 2 becomes β + 2α + γ = β + (α + γ) + α = β + 180° + α = 360°.

From Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°.

So now we have two equations:

1) 2β + α = 360°,

2) β + α + 180° = 360° ⇒ β + α = 180°.

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

(2β + α) - (β + α) = 360° - 180°,

Which simplifies to β = 180°.

So β = 180°, and from β + α = 180°, we get α = 0°, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's go back. We derived that α + γ = 180° from the triangle KJH analysis. Then, Equation 2 became β + α + γ = 360° - α? No, wait:

Original Equation 2 was β + 2α + γ = 360°, and since α + γ = 180°, substitute γ = 180° - α into Equation 2:

β + 2α + (180° - α) = 360°,

Which simplifies to β + α + 180° = 360°,

So β + α = 180°.

And Equation 1 was 2β + α = 360°.

So we have:

Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°,

Equation 2: β + α = 180°.

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(2β + α) - (β + α) = 360° - 180°,

Which gives β = 180°.

Then plugging back into Equation 2: 180° + α = 180° ⇒ α = 0°, which is impossible. Clearly, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that my earlier assumptions were incorrect.

Where did I go wrong? Let me trace back.

I assumed that in triangle KJH, angle at H (φ) is α/2, because it intercepts arc KJ. But is that accurate?

Wait, in triangle KJH, angle at H is formed by sides KH and HJ. So the intercepted arc would be the arc that does not contain H. Since the triangle is inscribed in the circle, the angle at H intercepts arc KJ. Yes, because the angle at H is formed by points K, H, J. So the intercepted arc is arc KJ, which is α. Therefore, the measure of angle φ is α/2. That seems correct.

Then, in triangle KJH, we had angles:

at J: γ/2,

at K: (α + γ)/2,

at H: α/2.

Their sum is γ/2 + (α + γ)/2 + α/2 = [γ + α + γ + α]/2 = (2α + 2γ)/2 = α + γ = 180°, which leads to α + γ = 180°. That part seems correct.

Then, Equation 2: β + 2α + γ = 360°, and with α + γ = 180°, it becomes β + 180° + α = 360°, so β + α = 180°.

Equation 1: 2β + α = 360°.

Solving these gives β = 180°, α = 0°, which is impossible. This implies that there's a flaw in the setup.

Possible error: Perhaps the assumption that angle at J in the quadrilateral is (β + α)/2 is incorrect.

Let me revisit the calculation of angle at J.

Earlier, I thought angle at J intercepts arc GK, which would be arc from G to K not passing through J. But in the cyclic quadrilateral, the arc GK would consist of arc GJ + arc JK, which is β + α. Hence, angle at J is half of that, so (β + α)/2. Is this correct?

Yes, because in a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. The angle at J is opposite to the arc GK, so it's half of arc GK. Arc GK is indeed β + α.

So that part seems correct. Then why the inconsistency?

Maybe the assumption that arc GH = arc JK is incorrect? Wait, GH and KJ are chords of the circle. Since GH ≅ KJ, their subtended arcs are congruent, so arc GH = arc KJ. But arc GH is from G to H, which is arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, that depends on the direction. Wait, arc GH could be the minor arc or major arc. If GH and KJ are sides of the quadrilateral, then their arcs are the ones that are less than 180°, assuming the quadrilateral is convex. So arc GH is the arc from G to H passing through the other points, which would be arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, that would be the long way around. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the arcs corresponding to the sides are the arcs that are opposite to the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps arc GH is simply the arc from G to H that does not pass through J or K, which would be arc GH = arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, that would be the entire circle minus arc KH. This is getting too confusing without a diagram.

Alternative approach: Let's forget arcs and think about the triangle.

We have GH ≅ KJ. Let's consider triangles GHJ and KJH. Wait, but I need to establish congruence or similarity.

Wait, if GH = KJ, and if we can show some other sides or angles are equal, maybe we can find some relationship.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ and the quadrilateral is cyclic, maybe triangle GJH is congruent to triangle KJH? Or something like that.

Wait, let me think. If we consider triangle GJH and triangle KJH. They share side JH. If GH = KJ, and if angle at J is common? Wait, no. Angle at J in triangle GJH is angle GJH, which is the same as angle KJH mentioned earlier. Wait, but angle GJH is part of the quadrilateral?

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to take a different route.

Let me assume that the sum of the two angles mentioned (angle GJK and angle KJH) is x, and we need to find x. Earlier, we derived that this sum is 180° - α/2, but that led to contradictions. Perhaps there's an alternative way.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ, and the quadrilateral is cyclic, maybe the angles subtended by these chords are equal. For example, angle at H subtended by GH is equal to angle at J subtended by KJ. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ, and GH and KJ are sides of the quadrilateral, maybe the angles opposite to these sides are equal. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angles opposite to equal sides might be equal? Not necessarily, unless there's some symmetry.

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, equal sides don't necessarily mean equal angles. For example, in a rectangle, all sides are equal, but all angles are 90°. In an isosceles trapezoid, which is cyclic, the non-parallel sides are equal, and base angles are equal.

But here, GH and KJ are equal. Let's assume that GH and KJ are the two sides that are equal. In a cyclic quadrilateral, if two sides are equal, then the angles opposite to them are equal. Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary. So if sides GH and KJ are equal, then perhaps the angles opposite to them are equal?

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the side GH is opposite to side JK. Wait, in quadrilateral GJKH, the sides are GJ, JK, KH, HG. So side GH is opposite to side JK. If GH ≅ KJ, then side GH ≅ side JK. So the sides opposite each other are congruent. In a cyclic quadrilateral, if two opposite sides are congruent, then what can we say about the angles?

Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, if two opposite sides are congruent, then the sum of the measures of the angles adjacent to each of those sides is equal. Or maybe the angles themselves are related.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on the cyclic quadrilateral. But this might be complex.

Alternatively, let's consider that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides (Ptolemy's theorem). But since we don't know the lengths of the diagonals, this might not help directly.

Wait, but if GH = KJ, then let's denote GH = KJ = a. Let me denote the other sides: GJ = b, KH = c.

Ptolemy's theorem states that GH * JK + GJ * KH = GJ * KH + GH * JK? Wait, no, Ptolemy's theorem says that the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides. So for quadrilateral GJKH, diagonals are GK and JH.

So Ptolemy's theorem: GK * JH = GJ * KH + JK * GH.

But since GH = JK = a, this becomes GK * JH = GJ * KH + a².

But without knowing GK, JH, GJ, KH, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangles.

Consider triangles GJK and KJH. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, focusing back on the angles. Let me assume that the sum of the two angles mentioned is x, and we need to find x. Earlier, we had that sum is 180° - α/2, but that led to contradictions. Let me try to find α.

From earlier, we had α + γ = 180°, and β + α = 180°, leading to β = 180°, which is impossible. This suggests that my assumption about the measure of angle at J is wrong.

Let me reconsider the measure of angle at J. Maybe it's not (arc GK)/2. Let me double-check.

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an internal angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. For example, angle at J is formed by chords GJ and JK, so it intercepts arc GK. The measure of angle J is half the measure of arc GK. But arc GK is the arc that doesn't contain J, which would be arc GJ + arc JK? No, if the quadrilateral is G-J-K-H-G, then arc GK would be the arc from G to K passing through H, which is arc GH + arc HK. Wait, arc GH is α, arc KH is γ, so arc GK is α + γ.

Wait, earlier I thought it was β + α, but that was incorrect. Let me fix this.

If arc GK is from G to K passing through H, then it is arc GH + arc HK = α + γ.

Therefore, angle at J is half of arc GK, which is (α + γ)/2.

Previously, I incorrectly thought it was β + α, but that was wrong. So correcting that:

Angle at J = (α + γ)/2.

Similarly, angle at H is formed by sides KH and HG, which intercepts arc KG. Arc KG is arc from K to G passing through J, which is arc KJ + arc JG = α + β.

Therefore, angle at H is (α + β)/2.

Since it's a cyclic quadrilateral, angle J + angle H = 180°, so:

(α + γ)/2 + (α + β)/2 = 180°,

Which simplifies to (2α + β + γ)/2 = 180°,

Multiply both sides by 2: 2α + β + γ = 360°.

But from earlier, we also had from the total circumference: arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = β + α + γ + α = β + 2α + γ = 360°, which matches the above equation. So this is consistent.

Now, let's revisit the earlier analysis of triangle KJH. Angle at J in triangle KJH is γ/2 (intercepting arc KH), angle at K is (arc JH)/2, and angle at H is α/2 (intercepting arc KJ).

Wait, let me recheck:

In triangle KJH, angle at J is formed by KJ and HJ, so it intercepts arc KH. Arc KH is γ, so angle at J is γ/2.

Angle at K in triangle KJH is formed by KJ and KH, so it intercepts arc JH. Arc JH is arc from J to H, which is arc JK + arc KH = α + γ. So angle at K is (α + γ)/2.

Angle at H in triangle KJH is formed by KH and HJ, so it intercepts arc KJ, which is α. So angle at H is α/2.

Thus, the sum of angles in triangle KJH is:

γ/2 + (α + γ)/2 + α/2 = [γ + α + γ + α]/2 = (2α + 2γ)/2 = α + γ = 180°.

So α + γ = 180°, as before.

Now, from the total circumference equation: 2α + β + γ = 360°, and since α + γ = 180°, substitute:

2α + β + γ = 2α + (α + γ) - α + β = ? Wait, let me substitute γ = 180° - α into 2α + β + γ = 360°:

2α + β + (180° - α) = 360°,

Simplify: α + β + 180° = 360°,

So α + β = 180°.

Now, we also have angle at J is (α + γ)/2 = (α + (180° - α))/2 = 180°/2 = 90°.

Wait, this is key! Angle at J is 90°? Because α + γ = 180°, so (α + γ)/2 = 90°. So angle at J is 90°.

But angle at J is the sum of angle GJK and angle KJH, which are the two angles mentioned in the problem. Wait, no. Earlier, we said that angle GJK is the angle at J in the quadrilateral, which is 90°. But the problem mentions angle GJK (which is angle at J) and angle KJH (another angle at J). Wait, but if angle at J is 90°, and angle KJH is part of it, then what is the relationship?

Wait, earlier, we said that angle at J in the quadrilateral is 90°, and angle KJH is part of triangle KJH, which is γ/2. But we also had that angle at J (quadrilateral) is (α + γ)/2 = 90°, and angle KJH is γ/2.

But how do these relate?

Wait, if angle at J in the quadrilateral is 90°, and angle KJH is γ/2, then what is the relationship between them?

If there is a diagonal from J to H, then angle at J in the quadrilateral is divided into two angles: angle GJK (which is part of the quadrilateral) and angle KJH (part of the triangle). So their sum is the total angle at J, which is 90°. So:

MeasureOf(Angle(G,J,K)) + MeasureOf(Angle(KJH)) = 90°.

But the problem says to find x, and the answer choices are 27, 54, 55, 83. If x is this sum, then x = 90°, but none of the options is 90. So this suggests that either my assumption is wrong, or x is something else.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating angle at J. Let me recheck.

Angle at J in the quadrilateral is (α + γ)/2 = 90°, and angle KJH is γ/2. So if I can find γ, then I can find angle KJH.

But we also have α + γ = 180°, so γ = 180° - α.

From α + β = 180°, so β = 180° - α.

Now, what about angle at H in the quadrilateral? It is (α + β)/2 = (α + 180° - α)/2 = 180°/2 = 90°. So angle at H is also 90°. So this quadrilateral has two right angles at J and H. So it's a cyclic quadrilateral with two right angles. But how does this help?

Now, let's consider the other angles. Angle at K and angle at G. Since the sum of all angles is 360°, and we have two angles at 90°, the remaining two angles at K and G must sum to 180°. 

But without more info, it's hard to determine. However, we might need to use the fact that GH = KJ.

Let me consider triangle GHJ and triangle KJH. Wait, GH = KJ, and if we can find other sides or angles.

Wait, in triangle KJH, we have angle at J is γ/2, angle at K is (α + γ)/2, and angle at H is α/2. We also know that α + γ = 180°, so angle at J in triangle KJH is γ/2 = (180° - α)/2. Angle at K is (α + γ)/2 = 90°, and angle at H is α/2.

So in triangle KJH, angles are:

At J: (180° - α)/2,

At K: 90°,

At H: α/2.

Sum: (180° - α)/2 + 90° + α/2 = [180° - α + 180° + α]/2 = 360°/2 = 180°, which checks out.

Now, let's consider triangle GHJ. Wait, but I don't know much about it. Alternatively, let's use the Law of Sines on triangle KJH.

In triangle KJH, by the Law of Sines:

KJ / sin(angle at H) = KH / sin(angle at J) = HJ / sin(angle at K).

Given that KJ = GH = a, and we need to relate other sides.

But without knowing the actual lengths, this might not help.

Alternatively, since GH = KJ, and GH is a side of the quadrilateral, while KJ is another side. Let me consider triangles GJH and KJH. Are they congruent or similar?

Wait, if GH = KJ, and if we can show some other sides or angles are equal, maybe.

But I'm stuck here. Let me think differently. Since angle at J is 90°, and angle KJH is γ/2, and α + γ = 180°, then γ = 180° - α. So angle KJH = (180° - α)/2 = 90° - α/2.

Also, angle GJK is part of the angle at J, which is 90°. So angle GJK + angle KJH = 90°. Wait, but angle GJK is the angle at J in the quadrilateral, which is 90°, and angle KJH is part of it. Wait, no, this is conflicting.

Wait, earlier, I said that angle at J in the quadrilateral is 90°, and angle KJH is part of it. So if there is a diagonal from J to H, then angle at J is split into angle GJK and angle KJH. So their sum is 90°. So angle GJK + angle KJH = 90°. But the problem says to find x, which is likely this sum. If x is this sum, then x = 90°, but this is not among the options. So something is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps x is one of the angles. For example, if angle KJH is x, and we need to find it. Let me see.

From above, angle KJH = γ/2 = (180° - α)/2. Also, angle at H in the quadrilateral is 90°, which is (α + β)/2 = 90°, and β = 180° - α. So this is consistent.

But how to find α?

Let me consider that in triangle KJH, angle at K is 90°, so it's a right triangle. So if triangle KJH is a right triangle, then by Pythagoras, KJ² + KH² = HJ². But we don't know the lengths.

But since GH = KJ, let's denote KJ = GH = a. Let me denote KH = c. Then, in triangle KJH, KJ = a, KH = c, and HJ = d. By Pythagoras, a² + c² = d².

But without additional info, I cannot find the value of α.

Wait, but in the cyclic quadrilateral, the sides are GJ = b, JK = a, KH = c, HG = a.

Using Ptolemy's theorem: GK * JH = GJ * KH + JK * GH.

But we don't know GK or JH.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on the quadrilateral.

But this is getting too abstract. Let me think of special cases. If the quadrilateral is a square, but in that case all sides are equal, but here only GH and KJ are equal.

Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is a rectangle, but then all angles are 90°, and all sides are equal in pairs, but again not matching.

Wait, but we have two right angles at J and H. So it's a cyclic quadrilateral with two right angles. Such a quadrilateral can be a rectangle, but in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Or it could be a kite, but kites are not usually cyclic unless they are rhombuses, which are squares.

Alternatively, it could be a cyclic quadrilateral with two right angles. For example, imagine a circle with points G, J, K, H such that angles at J and H are right angles.

Let me try to construct such a quadrilateral. Let's say the circle has diameter GH, so that angle at J and H are right angles. Wait, if GH is a diameter, then any point on the circle forms a right angle with G and H. So if J and K are points on the circle such that GH is a diameter, then angles at J and H would be right angles.

Wait, if GH is a diameter, and J is on the circle, then angle GJH is a right angle. Similarly, if K is on the circle, then angle GKH is a right angle. But how does this fit with the quadrilateral GJKH?

Let me assume GH is a diameter of the circle. Then, points G and H are endpoints of a diameter. Let J and K be points on the circle such that quadrilateral GJKH is formed. Then, angles at J and H would be right angles.

In this case, GH = 2R, where R is the radius. Let's say GH = KJ. So KJ = 2R.

But KJ is a chord of the circle. The length of chord KJ is 2R * sin(theta), where theta is half the central angle subtended by KJ. If KJ = 2R, then 2R * sin(theta) = 2R => sin(theta) = 1 => theta = 90°. So the central angle subtended by KJ is 180°, meaning KJ is a diameter. So KJ is also a diameter. But GH is already a diameter, so KJ is another diameter. This would mean that KJ is parallel to GH, or overlapping, but in a circle, there can be multiple diameters.

But if both GH and KJ are diameters, then they intersect at the center of the circle. So points G, H, J, K are arranged such that GH and KJ are diameters. This would make the quadrilateral GJKH a rectangle, since all angles would be right angles. But in this case, GH = KJ = 2R, and the quadrilateral is a rectangle, so all sides are equal? No, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So GJ = KH and JK = GH.

But in this case, since GH = KJ, it would mean that GJ = KH = GH = KJ, making it a square. But in a square, all sides are equal, so GH = KJ = GJ = KH. So this fits.

In this case, all angles are 90°, and the sum of angle GJK and angle KJH would be 90°, but again, this doesn't match the answer choices.

But the answer choices are 27, 54, 55, 83. None of these are 90. So this suggests that my assumption about the quadrilateral being a rectangle is incorrect, or that x is not the sum of the two angles.

Wait, perhaps x is one of the angles, like angle KJH or angle GJK. Let me think. If the quadrilateral is not a rectangle, but has two right angles at J and H, and GH = KJ.

Let me try to calculate angle KJH. In this scenario, if angle at J is 90°, and angle KJH is part of it, and if we can find it.

But without more info, it's difficult. Let me consider that in triangle KJH, which is a right triangle at K (since angle at K is 90°). Wait, earlier I said angle at K in triangle KJH is 90°, but that was under the assumption that α + γ = 180°, and angle at K in triangle KJH is (α + γ)/2 = 90°. So triangle KJH is a right triangle at K.

So in right triangle KJH, with right angle at K, and legs KJ and KH, and hypotenuse HJ.

Given that KJ = GH, and we need to relate this to the other sides.

But without knowing the lengths, it's hard to find angles. Let me assume some values.

Let me let KJ = 1 (unit length). Then GH = 1.

In right triangle KJH, KJ = 1, KH = c, HJ = sqrt(1^2 + c^2).

But how does this help?

Also, in the cyclic quadrilateral, GH = 1, KJ = 1, and other sides are GJ = b, KH = c.

But without more information, it's challenging.

Alternatively, let's consider the measure of angle KJH, which is γ/2. And γ = 180° - α.

Also, from earlier, angle at J in the quadrilateral is (α + γ)/2 = 90°, and angle KJH is γ/2. So if I can express γ in terms of α, but I don't have enough equations.

Wait, from α + γ = 180°, and from the total circumference equation, we had α + β = 180°, and β = 180° - α. But this doesn't give new info.

Wait, but if angle at K in the quadrilateral is (arc JH)/2. Arc JH is arc from J to H, which is arc JK + arc KH = α + γ = 180°, so angle at K is 180°/2 = 90°. So angle at K is also 90°. Similarly, angle at G is (arc JH)/2 = 90°, since arc JH is 180°. Wait, no, angle at G is formed by sides GJ and GH, so it intercepts arc JH. Wait, arc JH is 180°, so angle at G is 180°/2 = 90°. So all four angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. But this brings us back to the rectangle scenario, where all angles are 90°, and the sum of angle GJK and angle KJH is 90°, but again, not matching the answer choices.

This suggests that there is a miscalculation somewhere, or the problem requires a different approach.

Let me try a different angle. Let's assume that the sum of the two angles is x, and try to find x using the given conditions.

We have angle GJK + angle KJH = x.

From earlier, in the cyclic quadrilateral, angle at J is 90°, and if angle GJK + angle KJH = 90°, then x = 90°, which is not an option. But the closest option is 90°, but it's not listed. So this suggests that either the problem is different, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check if angle at J is not 90°. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating it.

Earlier, I said angle at J is (α + γ)/2, and since α + γ = 180°, it is 90°. But maybe this is incorrect.

Let me re-examine the calculation of angle at J. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. The angle at J is formed by chords GJ and JK, so it intercepts arc GK. The measure of arc GK is the arc from G to K that doesn't pass through J, which is arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, arc GK would be the arc from G to K passing through H, which is arc GH + arc HK = α + γ. So angle at J is (α + γ)/2. And since α + γ = 180°, it is 90°. This seems correct.

But if this is the case, then the sum of the two angles is 90°, but this is not an option. So perhaps the question is asking for one of the individual angles?

For example, if angle KJH is x, and we need to find it. Let me recall that in triangle KJH, which is a right triangle at K, with KJ = a, KH = c, and HJ = d. Let's say angle at J is x = γ/2.

But we also have from α + γ = 180°, and α + β = 180°, and β = 180° - α.

But without more information, it's hard to find γ.

Wait, but in this scenario, since GH = KJ, and GH is a chord of the circle, and KJ is another chord. If GH = KJ, and they are both chords, then the arcs they subtend are equal. So arc GH = arc KJ = α.

But arc GH is from G to H, which is α, and arc KJ is from K to J, which is α.

But in the circle, the total circumference is 360°, so arc GH + arc KJ + arc GJ + arc KH = 360°. Wait, but arc GH is α, arc KJ is α, arc GJ is β, arc KH is γ. So α + α + β + γ = 360°, and we also have α + γ = 180°, and β + α = 180°. So:

From α + γ = 180°, and β + α = 180°, so β = γ.

So β = γ.

From α + γ = 180°, and β = γ, so α + β = 180°, which is consistent.

Now, let's consider the arc GJ = β, arc KH = γ = β.

So arc GJ = arc KH = β.

Now, let's consider the angle at G. It is formed by sides GJ and GH, so it intercepts arc JH. Arc JH is arc from J to H, which is arc JK + arc KH = α + β. So angle at G is (α + β)/2 = (α + β)/2. But from α + β = 180°, this is 90°, so angle at G is 90°, making all angles 90°, hence a rectangle. But this again leads to x = 90°.

This suggests that the problem might have a typo or missing information, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the measure of angle GJK, which is part of the angle at J. If angle at J is 90°, and angle KJH is part of it, but without knowing the exact division, it's impossible to say. But if the quadrilateral is a rectangle, then angle GJK is 90°, and angle KJH is also 90°, but that would make their sum 180°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is not a rectangle, but has angle at J = 90°, and angle KJH is some portion of it. Let me assume that the diagonal JH divides the 90° angle at J into two parts, angle GJK and angle KJH. If the quadrilateral is symmetric, perhaps these two angles are equal, making each 45°, but 45° is not an option either.

Alternatively, if GH = KJ, and using some trigonometric identities. Let me assume that in triangle KJH, which is a right triangle at K, with KJ = GH = a, and KH = b, then tan(angle KJH) = opposite/adjacent = KH/KJ = b/a. But without knowing the ratio of a and b, I can't find the angle.

But since GH = KJ = a, and in the cyclic quadrilateral, GH is a side, and KJ is another side. If I can relate a and b through the circle.

The length of a chord is 2R sin(theta), where theta is half the central angle. So for GH = a = 2R sin(θ1), and KJ = a = 2R sin(θ2). Since GH and KJ are equal, sin(θ1) = sin(θ2), so θ1 = θ2 or θ1 = 180° - θ2. But without knowing the positions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if the central angles for GH and KJ are equal, then their subtended arcs are equal, which we already have.

But this is not helping.

Given that I'm stuck, and the answer choices are 27, 54, 55, 83, let me think about common angles in cyclic quadrilaterals. For example, if the sum of the two angles is 54°, or 83°, which are close to 90°, but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the angle at J. Let me re-express the angle at J.

If the quadrilateral is cyclic, and GH = KJ, perhaps it's an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal, and it's cyclic. But in this case, GH and KJ are the non-parallel sides? Or the bases?

Let me assume it's an isosceles trapezoid with bases GJ and KH, and legs GH and KJ. If GH = KJ, then it's an isosceles trapezoid with legs equal. In this case, the base angles are equal. The angles at J and K would be equal, and angles at G and H would be equal.

But in this case, the sum of angle at J and angle at H would be 180°, as in any trapezoid. But if it's isosceles, then angle at J = angle at K, and angle at G = angle at H.

But how does this relate to the given conditions?

If it's an isosceles trapezoid with bases GJ and KH, and legs GH and KJ, then the angles at J and K are equal. But the problem states GH = KJ, which would be the legs, so this fits. In this case, the angles at J and K are equal.

But how to find the measure of the angles?

In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Let's say the bases are GJ and KH. The angles at J and K are equal. Let's call them both x. The angles at G and H are equal, let's call them y. Since it's cyclic, x + y = 180°.

But also, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are supplementary to the adjacent angles. Wait, no, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary.

But in this case, if it's cyclic, then it
