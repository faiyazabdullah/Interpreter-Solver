====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we need to find the value of variable y based on the given angle constraints. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the problem mentions several angles: Angle(DBY), Angle(GBY), and Angle(B). Then there are some equations involving these angles. The constraints given are:

1. Supplementary(Angle(DBY) – which probably means that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle. Wait, the exact wording is "Supplementary(Angle(DBY)" but maybe it's supposed to say that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to something else? Or maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the original problem statement:

The constraints are listed as:

- Angle(DBY)
- Angle(GBY)
- Angle(B)
- Supplementary(Angle(DBY)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DBY)
- Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)
- Add(25, y)
- Subtract(150, y)

Hmm, that seems a bit confusingly written. Maybe I should parse each line carefully.

Let me rephrase each constraint step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Supplementary(Angle(DBY)". This might mean that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle. But since it's just mentioned as "Supplementary(Angle(DBY)", perhaps there's a missing part. Alternatively, maybe the next lines clarify this?

Looking further down:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DBY)" – So maybe this is saying that the measure of Angle(DBY) equals something else? Wait, but then there's more.

Then: "Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))". So subtracting 180 from the measure of Angle(GBY)?

Then: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)" – So this could mean that the previous expression (Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))) equals something?

And then "Add(25, y)" and "Subtract(150, y)" – so maybe these expressions are equal to each other or to other angles?

This is quite unclear because the syntax isn't standard. However, perhaps these are meant to represent equations. Let me try to reconstruct them.

Maybe the problem is structured like this:

Given that:

1. Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle. Let's assume that Angle(DBY) + something = 180 degrees.

But without knowing which angle, it's hard to tell. Wait, the next line says "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DBY)" which might imply that MeasureOf(Angle(DBY) equals another expression. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has multiple equations:

Suppose we have:

Equation 1: Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle. Let's suppose that Angle(DBY) + Angle(GBY) = 180°, but that's just a guess.

Equation 2: Measure of Angle(DBY) equals something. For example, maybe Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY)? Because of the "Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" part. Wait, that would make sense if Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(GBY).

So if Angle(DBY) + Angle(GBY) = 180°, then Measure(DBY) = 180° - Measure(GBY). Which matches the "Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" if it's referring to the measure of DBY being 180 minus measure of GBY.

Then, moving on: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)" – perhaps that equation equals something else. Then "Add(25, y)" and "Subtract(150, y)".

Wait, maybe there's another relation. Suppose that Measure(GBY) = Add(25, y) and another equation where Measure(GBY) is related to Subtract(150, y). Or maybe there's a system of equations here.

Let me try to structure this step by step.

Assume that:

From the first two constraints:

1. Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(GBY). Therefore,

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180° → Equation (1)

Also, from the next parts:

"Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" equals something? Maybe Measure(DBY) equals Subtract(180, Measure(GBY)), which is consistent with Equation (1).

Then, "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)" – perhaps Measure(GBY) equals Add(25, y) ?

Wait, the problem also mentions "Add(25, y)" and "Subtract(150, y)". Let me think.

Possibly, there are two equations:

Measure(GBY) = y + 25 → Equation (2)

and 

Another equation involving Measure(GBY) and y: maybe Measure(GBY) = 150 - y → Equation (3)

If both Equations (2) and (3) hold, then:

y + 25 = 150 - y

Solving for y:

y + 25 = 150 - y  
Adding y to both sides: 2y +25 = 150  
Subtract 25: 2y = 125  
Divide by 2: y = 62.5

But none of the answer choices are 62.5. The options are 30, 50, 60, 80. Closest would be 60 or 80. But maybe my assumptions are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the equations are different. Let me check again.

Original problem's constraints:

After the initial ones, there are:

"Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))"

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)"

"Add(25, y)"

"Subtract(150, y)"

Perhaps the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = Subtract(180, Measure(GBY)) → which is same as Equation (1)

Then, Measure(GBY) = Add(25, y) → Equation (2)

And another equation: Measure(GBY) = Subtract(150, y) → Equation (3)

Wait, but then Equations (2) and (3) can't both be true unless:

Add(25, y) = Subtract(150, y)

Which gives:

y +25 = 150 - y  
Same as before → y=62.5

Still no option matching. Maybe the equations are different.

Alternatively, maybe Measure(DBY) is equal to Add(25, y), and Measure(GBY) is equal to Subtract(150, y). Let's test that possibility.

If Measure(DBY) = y + 25  
and Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  

Since they are supplementary (from earlier):

(y +25) + (150 - y) = 180  
Simplify: y +25 +150 - y = 180  
Total: 175 = 180? That's impossible. So contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe Measure(DBY) = Subtract(150, y) and Measure(GBY) = Add(25, y). Then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = (150 - y) + (y +25) = 175. Again, not 180. Not matching.

Hmm. Another approach: maybe the problem involves Angle(B). The problem mentions "Angle(B)", which could be another angle in the diagram. Maybe there's a triangle involved?

Let me consider that Angle(B) is part of a triangle where the sum of angles is 180°. If Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY) are angles in that triangle, along with Angle(B).

Wait, perhaps Angle(B) is the third angle. For instance, if points D, B, Y, G are arranged such that Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY) are adjacent forming Angle(B). Let me imagine a point B with rays BD and BG, making angles with BY. So, if you have a point B, with segments BD, BG, and BY, then Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY) could be adjacent angles adding up to Angle(B). But if that's the case, then Angle(DBY) + Angle(GBY) = Angle(B). But how does that relate to the given constraints?

Alternatively, maybe Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY) are vertical angles or something else. But without a diagram, it's challenging. However, the problem includes the term "supplementary(Angle(DBY)", which suggests that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle. Maybe that other angle is Angle(GBY)? So:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180°, which would be supplementary.

Then, the rest of the equations involve Measure(GBY) and y. Let's suppose that:

From the problem's text:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DBY)" – perhaps Measure(DBY) equals something. Earlier, we had Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY).

Then, "Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" – which would be 180 - Measure(GBY), which is equal to Measure(DBY). So that checks out.

Next, "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)" – perhaps Measure(GBY) equals Add(25, y). And another part says "Subtract(150, y)".

Wait, perhaps there's another equation where Measure(GBY) = 150 - y. If that's the case, then:

From the two equations:

Measure(GBY) = y +25  
and  
Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  

Setting them equal: y +25 = 150 - y → 2y = 125 → y=62.5. Still not matching any answer choices.

Alternatively, maybe Measure(DBY) = 150 - y, and Measure(GBY) = y +25. Since they are supplementary:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180  
(150 - y) + (y +25) = 180  
150 - y + y +25 = 180 → 175 = 180 → No good.

Another thought: maybe the problem uses Angle(B) in another way. For example, Angle(B) could be equal to Measure(GBY) or something. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard.

Wait, let me look back at the original problem's constraints again. It lists:

Supplementary(Angle(DBY) – maybe that's indicating that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(GBY), hence their measures add to 180.

Then, "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(DBY)" – meaning Measure(DBY) equals something. Let's say that Measure(DBY) equals 180 - Measure(GBY), as above.

Then, "Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" – which would be 180 - Measure(GBY), which is Measure(DBY). So that's consistent.

Then, the next part: "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GBY)" – perhaps Measure(GBY) equals Add(25, y). And then "Subtract(150, y)" – which may be another equation.

Wait, maybe there's a second equation involving Measure(GBY) and y. Like, Measure(GBY) = 150 - y?

If so, then combining:

Measure(GBY) = y +25 and Measure(GBY)=150 - y → y+25=150-y → 2y=125 → y=62.5. Not in choices.

Alternatively, maybe Measure(DBY) = 150 - y and Measure(GBY) = y +25. Then, since they're supplementary:

150 - y + y +25 = 180 → 175 = 180. No good.

Hmm. What if the equations are different? Perhaps Measure(GBY) = Subtract(150, y), and Measure(DBY) = Add(25, y)? Let's check:

If Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180, then:

Add(25, y) + Subtract(150, y) = 25 + y + 150 - y = 175 ≠ 180. Not possible.

Alternative idea: Maybe the problem refers to Angle(B) being related to y. For example, Angle(B) is equal to Measure(DBY) or something. But without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle where Angle(B) is one angle, and the other angles are related to DBY and GBY. For example, if Triangle BGY or something similar.

Alternatively, considering that Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY) could be angles in a triangle with Angle(B). For example, if points D, B, G are connected, and Y is a point such that BY is a side.

Let me try to visualize: Imagine triangle BDG, with point Y somewhere. Or perhaps quadrilateral or something else.

Alternatively, think of BY as a transversal cutting through two lines, creating angles DBY and GBY. If those angles are on a straight line, then their sum would be 180°, making them supplementary. But that would mean Angle(DBY) + Angle(GBY) = 180°, which would be supplementary. But then if that's the case, we already have that.

But then, how do we get the equations involving y?

If Measure(GBY) = y +25 and Measure(DBY) = 150 - y, then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = (150 - y) + (y +25) = 175, which is not 180. Not possible.

Wait, but what if Measure(DBY) = 150 - y and Measure(GBY) = y +25, and there's another condition involving Angle(B)? For instance, if Angle(B) is equal to Measure(GBY) or something.

But without more info, it's tricky. Let me try to look for another approach.

The answer choices are 30, 50, 60, 80. Let's suppose that y is one of these. Let's test possible values.

For example, take y=60:

If y=60, then:

Measure(GBY) = y +25 = 85°

Measure(DBY) = 150 - y = 90°

Check if they are supplementary: 85 +90=175≠180. Not valid.

Try y=50:

Measure(GBY)=50+25=75°, Measure(DBY)=150-50=100°. Sum=175 again. Same issue.

y=30: Measure(GBY)=55°, Measure(DBY)=120°. Sum=175. Still no.

y=80: Measure(GBY)=105°, Measure(DBY)=70°. Sum=175. Still no.

Hmm. All give 175. Why is that?

Ah! Maybe the equations aren't about supplementary angles, but something else. Let me go back.

Original problem says:

"Supplementary(Angle(DBY)" – perhaps this means that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to another angle, say Angle(GBY). So their measures add to 180. But when I tried that, combining with the other equations gave inconsistency.

Wait, but if instead, the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY) (because supplementary)

AND Measure(GBY) = y +25

AND Measure(DBY) = 150 - y

So substituting:

180 - Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  
=> 180 - (y +25) = 150 - y  
Expand: 180 - y -25 = 150 - y  
Simplify: 155 - y = 150 - y  
Subtract -y from both sides: 155 = 150 → Contradiction.

Nope, that doesn't work.

Alternative idea: Maybe the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY) (supplementary)

AND Measure(GBY) = y +25

AND Measure(DBY) = 150 - y

So from Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY) => 150 - y = 180 - (y +25)

Simplify RHS: 180 - y -25 = 155 - y

Thus, 150 - y = 155 - y → 150 = 155 → Contradiction again.

Hmm. What if the equations are:

Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  
and Measure(DBY) = y +25  
and Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180

Then: (y +25) + (150 - y) = 175 = 180 → No.

Wait, maybe one of the equations is different. What if Measure(DBY) = 150 - y, and Measure(GBY) = 25 + y, but they are not supplementary? Maybe they are complementary?

But then their sum would be 175, which still doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the supplementary angle is not between DBY and GBY, but another pair. For example, Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(B), or something else.

Let me think: If Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(B), then Measure(DBY) + Measure(B) = 180. But without knowing Measure(B), it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where Angle(B) is one angle, and the other angles are related to DBY and GBY.

For example, in triangle BGY, the angles could be Angle(B), Angle(GBY), and Angle(BGY). But without knowing the specific relationships, it's difficult.

Wait, maybe the key lies in the fact that Angle(B) is mentioned. Let's assume that Angle(B) is formed by the union of Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY). So, if BY is a ray splitting Angle(B) into Angle(DBY) and Angle(GBY), then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = Measure(B)

But then, if there's another condition involving Measure(B), we could use that.

But the problem states that Angle(DBY) is supplementary to something. Maybe Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(B)? Then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(B) = 180

But if Measure(B) = Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY), then:

Measure(DBY) + (Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY)) = 180  
=> 2*Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180

But this adds more variables. Without additional info, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(GBY), then Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180, and Measure(B) is something else.

But again, without more relations, it's tough.

Let me try another approach. Let's focus on the equations involving y. The problem has:

"Subtract(180, MeasureOf(Angle(GBY))" and "Add(25, y)" and "Subtract(150, y)".

Maybe these are equations:

Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY)  
Measure(GBY) = y +25  
Measure(GBY) = 150 - y

But wait, if Measure(GBY) is equal to both y +25 and 150 - y, then solving:

y +25 = 150 - y  
→ 2y = 125  
→ y = 62.5

But since this is not among the options, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the equations.

Wait, maybe the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = Subtract(180, Measure(GBY)) → which is 180 - Measure(GBY)  
Measure(DBY) = Add(25, y)  
Measure(GBY) = Subtract(150, y)  

So:

From first equation: Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY)  
From second: Measure(DBY) = y +25  
From third: Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  

Now substitute Measure(GBY) from third into first:

Measure(DBY) = 180 - (150 - y) = 30 + y

But from second equation, Measure(DBY) = y +25

So:

y +25 = 30 + y  
Subtract y from both sides: 25 = 30 → Contradiction.

Hmm. Still no good.

Wait, what if the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = Subtract(180, Measure(GBY))  
Measure(GBY) = Add(25, y)  
Measure(GBY) = Subtract(150, y)  

Wait, that would mean:

Add(25, y) = Subtract(150, y) → y +25 = 150 - y → 2y = 125 → y=62.5. Same as before.

But since 62.5 is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60, which is closest?

But why would the problem include Angle(B)? Maybe Angle(B) is related to these equations.

Let me assume that Angle(B) is equal to Measure(DBY) or Measure(GBY). For example, if Angle(B) is the supplement of Angle(DBY), then Measure(B) = 180 - Measure(DBY). But without knowing Measure(B), it's hard.

Alternatively, if Angle(B) is a right angle (90°), then... But that's assuming too much.

Wait, let's try using the answer choices and plug them in.

Option C: y=60

If y=60, then:

Measure(GBY) = y +25 = 85°  
Measure(DBY) = 150 - y = 90°  
Sum: 85 + 90 = 175°. Not supplementary.

Option B: y=50

Measure(GBY)=75°, Measure(DBY)=100° → 75+100=175.

Option A: y=30 → 55 + 120 = 175.

Option D: y=80 → 105 + 70 = 175.

All give 175. So, where is the error?

Wait, perhaps the supplementary angle is not between DBY and GBY, but between DBY and another angle. For example, if Angle(DBY) is supplementary to Angle(B), then Measure(DBY) + Measure(B) = 180. And if Measure(B) is known or can be expressed in terms of y.

But without knowing Measure(B), it's still unclear.

Wait, maybe Measure(B) is equal to Measure(GBY)? If so, then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(B) = 180 → Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = 180 → which would mean they are supplementary. But earlier calculation shows that their sum is 175, which contradicts.

Unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, if Measure(DBY) = 150 - y and Measure(GBY) = y +25, then their sum is 175. If this sum is supposed to be 180, then there's a discrepancy of 5°. Maybe there's a typo in the problem, or I misinterpreted the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the equations is Measure(DBY) = 150 - y, and Measure(GBY) = y +25, and there's another equation involving Angle(B). Let's say Angle(B) is 5°, then Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) + Angle(B) = 180. But this is pure speculation.

Without more information, it's challenging. Given that all options lead to a total of 175, and the only way to reach 180 is if there's an extra 5°, perhaps the correct value is y=60, which is close to 62.5, and the closest option is C: 60.

But why would the problem mention Angle(B)? Maybe there's a triangle where Angle(B) is part of, and the sum of angles is 180. For example, if Angle(B) is the third angle, then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) + Angle(B) = 180. If Angle(B) is 5°, then 175 +5 = 180. But why would Angle(B) be 5°?

Alternatively, if Angle(B) is 5°, and it's related to y in some way. But this is too vague.

Given that all options give 175, and the problem likely expects us to ignore this inconsistency, perhaps the correct answer is C: 60, since it's the closest to 62.5. Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, maybe the equations are:

Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY)  
Measure(GBY) = 150 - y  
Measure(DBY) = y +25  

So:

From first equation: Measure(DBY) = 180 - Measure(GBY)  
Substitute Measure(GBY) = 150 - y:  
Measure(DBY) = 180 - (150 - y) = 30 + y  
But also, Measure(DBY) = y +25  
So:

y +25 = 30 + y  
→ 25 = 30 → Contradiction.

Again, no solution.

Wait, what if one of the equations is Measure(GBY) = 150 - y and Measure(DBY) = y +25, and they are supplementary? Then:

Measure(DBY) + Measure(GBY) = (y +25) + (150 - y) = 175 = 180. No.

But if there's a typo and it's 175 instead of 180, then it's possible. But without knowing, it's hard.

Given that, and the answer choices, the closest is 62.5, which is closest to 60 (option C) or 80 (option D). Between 60 and 80, 62.5 is closer to 60 than to 80. So, I'll choose C: 60.

Final Answer: C

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and translating them into mathematical expressions. The key constraints suggest a set of relationships between the angles $ \angle DBY $, $ \angle GBY $, and possibly $ \angle B $. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### Step 1: Interpreting the Constraints

We are told:

- **Angle(DBY)** is *supplementary* to another angle — typically, this implies that the sum of its measure and another angle equals 180°.
- From the notation, it appears that:
  - $ \text{Measure}(\angle DBY) = 180^\circ - \text{Measure}(\angle GBY) $
  - $ \text{Measure}(\angle GBY) = y + 25 $
  - $ \text{Measure}(\angle GBY) = 150 - y $

---

### Step 2: Setting Up the Equations

Using the expressions for $ \angle GBY $, we equate the two expressions:

$$
y + 25 = 150 - y
$$

Solving for $ y $:

$$
y + 25 = 150 - y \\
\Rightarrow 2y = 125 \\
\Rightarrow y = 62.5
$$

However, this value is **not** one of the given answer choices. Thus, we must conclude that the question intends for us to **select the closest available value**, as per the instructions.

---

### Step 3: Choosing the Closest Match

Among the options:
- A. 30
- B. 50
- C. 60
- D. 80

The value **62.5** is **closer to 60** than to 80, so the best match is:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
