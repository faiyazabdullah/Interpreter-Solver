MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle GHJ that's a right triangle. The right angle is at point H because it says Angle(G,H,J) is a right angle. Also, Triangle(G,H,J) is right, which confirms that. Then there are some equal lengths mentioned: LengthOf Line(G,J) equals LengthOf Line(H,J). Wait, so GJ equals HJ? And also, line GJ is vertical. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Let's assume coordinates might help here. Since there's a right angle at H, maybe placing points on a coordinate system would make sense. Let me assign coordinates to each point. Let's say point H is at the origin (0,0) since it's the right angle. Now, since line GJ is vertical, that means points G and J lie on a vertical line. But wait, line GJ is vertical. If GJ is vertical, then points G and J share the same x-coordinate. However, since H is at (0,0), and the triangle has sides GH, HJ, and GJ. 

Wait, but if GJ is vertical, then maybe G is somewhere along the vertical line, and J is another point on the same vertical line. But then how does the right angle come into play? The right angle is at H, so the legs are GH and HJ. So GH and HJ are perpendicular. Therefore, if H is at (0,0), then maybe GH is horizontal and HJ is vertical, or vice versa. Wait, but line GJ is vertical. So G and J are on a vertical line. Let me think again.

If triangle GHJ is right-angled at H, then sides GH and HJ are the legs, and GJ is the hypotenuse. But the problem states that LengthOf Line(G,J) equals LengthOf Line(H,J). Wait, that can't be unless the triangle is isoceles. Because if GJ equals HJ, then in a right triangle, that would mean the two legs are equal? Wait no, because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is longer than either leg. Wait, but here they're saying that length of GJ (hypotenuse) equals length of HJ (one of the legs)? That seems impossible unless my understanding is wrong.

Hold on, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J))"

So, it's saying that the length of line GJ is equal to the length of line HJ. So, in triangle GHJ, GJ = HJ. But since it's a right triangle at H, that would imply that the legs are GH and HJ, and GJ is the hypotenuse. Therefore, if GJ = HJ, then hypotenuse equals one of the legs. Which would only happen if the triangle isn't a standard right triangle. Wait, but according to Pythagoras theorem, hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of legs. So if hypotenuse equals one leg, then:

Let me denote:

Let’s call GH as one leg, HJ as another leg, and GJ as hypotenuse.

But the problem says GJ = HJ. So substituting into Pythagoras:

HJ² + GH² = GJ²

But since GJ = HJ,

HJ² + GH² = HJ² → GH² = 0 → GH=0, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So perhaps my initial assumption about which sides are which is incorrect?

Wait, maybe the right angle is at H, so the legs are GH and HJ, making GJ the hypotenuse. But the problem says that GJ equals HJ. Which would require the hypotenuse to be equal to one of the legs, which isn't possible unless... Wait, maybe I got the labels wrong. Maybe the right angle is at J instead? Wait, no, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(G,H,J)), meaning the angle at H is the right angle. So angle at H between lines HG and HJ is 90 degrees.

Alternatively, could the problem have a typo, but assuming it's correct, maybe there's something else. Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not a right triangle? But the problem says Triangle(G,H,J) is right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting which segments are which. Let me re-examine the problem statement:

The given constraints include:

- Triangle(G,H,J)

- Point(G), Point(H), Point(J)

- Lines: Line(G,H), Line(H,J), Line(G,J)

- RightAngle(Angle(G,H,J)): So the right angle is at H between points G, H, J.

Therefore, triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. Hence, the legs are GH and HJ, and the hypotenuse is GJ.

Then the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J))). So GJ equals HJ. But according to Pythagoras, GJ^2 = GH^2 + HJ^2. If GJ = HJ, then substituting gives HJ^2 = GH^2 + HJ^2 ⇒ GH^2 = 0 ⇒ GH = 0. Which is impossible. So this suggests that there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem meant that LengthOf(Line(G,J)) equals LengthOf(Line(H,I))? Or maybe there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that GH equals HJ? Because that would make sense for an isoceles right triangle. For example, if GH = HJ, then GJ would be hypotenuse, sqrt(2)*GH. But the problem states that GJ equals HJ. So that still doesn't add up.

Wait, but the problem also includes other constraints:

IsVertical(Line(G,J))

IsHorizontal(Line(H,I))

IsHorizontal(Line(H,K))

IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J))

Wait, maybe there's more to the diagram. Let me try to parse all constraints step by step.

First, the triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. So H is the right-angle vertex. Then, the line GJ is vertical. So line connecting G and J is vertical. Also, line HJ is part of the triangle. Also, there are lines HI and HK, with HI and HK being horizontal. Additionally, line GJ is parallel to line HJ. Wait, IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J))? Wait, Line(G,J) is vertical, and Line(H,J) is one of the legs of the triangle. Since the triangle is right-angled at H, Line(H,J) is one leg. If Line(G,J) is vertical, and Line(H,J) is parallel to it, then Line(H,J) is also vertical. But that would mean that both GJ and HJ are vertical lines, implying that points G and J are vertically aligned, and H and J are vertically aligned, so H and G would be on the same vertical line through J. But then the triangle would have points G, H, J colinear? No, because it's a triangle. That seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to draw coordinates. Let me assign coordinates based on the given information.

Since line GJ is vertical, let's suppose that line GJ is vertical. So points G and J lie on a vertical line. Let me set coordinates such that J is at (a, b), and G is at (a, c) since they are on the same vertical line. Then, since the triangle is right-angled at H, which is connected to both G and J via lines GH and HJ. Also, line HJ is part of the triangle. Since line HJ connects H to J, and line HJ is supposed to be parallel to line GJ (from IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J))). Wait, the problem says IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J)). So line GJ is parallel to line HJ. But line GJ is vertical, so line HJ must also be vertical. Therefore, line HJ is vertical. Thus, point H lies on the same vertical line as J and G. Therefore, H has the same x-coordinate as J and G. So points G, H, J are all on the same vertical line. But then triangle GHJ would be degenerate, since all three points are colinear. Which contradicts the fact that it's a triangle. So there's a problem here.

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me recheck the problem statement. It says:

IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J)) ?

Wait, no, looking back:

Original constraints:

IsParallel(Line(G,J)
IsParallel(Line(H,J)

Wait, the original problem lists several constraints. Let me re-read the entire list:

"Given Geometric Constraints:

Triangle(G,H,J)

Point(G)

Point(H)

Point(J)

Line(G,H)

Line(H,J)

Line(G,J)

RightAngle(Angle(G,H,J)

Right(Triangle(G,H,J)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)

IsVertical(Line(G,J)

Line(K,J)

IsHorizontal(Line(H,I)

IsHorizontal(Line(H,K)

IsParallel(Line(G,J)
IsParallel(Line(H,J)"

Wait, perhaps there was a formatting error in the problem. Maybe the last line should be "IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J))"? Assuming that, then Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,J). But since Line(G,J) is vertical, Line(H,J) must also be vertical, leading to the previous problem of collinearity.

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo and it's supposed to be IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,K))? Or some other combination. Given that there's a Line(K,J) mentioned later, perhaps there's more structure here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,K), but due to formatting errors, it's written differently. This is getting confusing. Let me try to proceed with what I have.

Assuming that the problem states that Line(G,J) is vertical, and Line(H,J) is parallel to it. Therefore, Line(H,J) is also vertical. Therefore, points H and J are on the same vertical line. So, if J is at (x,y), then H is also at (x, y'), for some y'. Similarly, G is at (x, z), since GJ is vertical. Therefore, points G, H, J are all on the vertical line x. So triangle GHJ is formed by three points on the same vertical line, which makes them colinear. Contradiction. So there's a problem here.

Perhaps the problem has a mistake in the constraints? Or maybe I misinterpreted the parallelism. Let me consider that maybe Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,K), not Line(H,J). But without knowing the exact constraint, it's hard to tell. However, given that there's a Line(K,J) mentioned, maybe there's a rectangle involved. For instance, since Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal, and Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal, implying that I and K are on the same horizontal line as H. Also, since Line(H,K) is horizontal, and Line(H,I) is horizontal. So points I and K are horizontally aligned with H.

Additionally, since Line(K,J) is mentioned. So point K is connected to J. Maybe forming a rectangle or something. Let me try to reconstruct.

Let me start over. Given that triangle GHJ is right-angled at H. Let me place H at (0,0). Since Line(G,J) is vertical, so G and J are on a vertical line. Suppose that G is at (a, b) and J is at (a, c). Then, since Line(G,J) is vertical. Also, since triangle GHJ is right-angled at H, which is (0,0). So the legs are GH and HJ. GH connects G(a,b) to H(0,0), and HJ connects H(0,0) to J(a,c). These two lines should be perpendicular. So the slope of GH times the slope of HJ should be -1.

Slope of GH: (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a.

Slope of HJ: (c - 0)/(a - 0) = c/a.

Their product is (b/a)*(c/a) = bc / a². For them to be perpendicular, this product should be -1. So bc = -a².

Also, since the triangle is right-angled at H, and GJ is the hypotenuse. Wait, but earlier we had the problem that GJ equals HJ. Let me check that. The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)). So |GJ| = |HJ|. Let me compute these lengths.

Length of GJ: distance between G(a,b) and J(a,c) is |b - c|.

Length of HJ: distance between H(0,0) and J(a,c) is √[(a)^2 + (c)^2].

Setting them equal: |b - c| = √(a² + c²).

Square both sides: (b - c)^2 = a² + c² → b² - 2bc + c² = a² + c² → b² - 2bc = a².

From earlier, bc = -a². Substitute bc = -a² into this equation:

b² - 2(-a²) = a² → b² + 2a² = a² → b² + a² = 0. Which implies a = 0 and b = 0. But then points G and J would be at (0,0), which is the same as H. Not possible. So again, contradiction.

Hmm. There's a fundamental inconsistency here. Perhaps the problem meant that LengthOf(Line(G,H)) equals LengthOf(Line(H,J))? That would make sense for an isoceles right triangle. Let me assume that there was a typo, and the equality is between GH and HJ. Then, GH = HJ. In that case, with H at (0,0), G at (a,b), J at (a,c). Then, GH length is √(a² + b²), HJ length is √(a² + c²). Setting them equal gives a² + b² = a² + c² → b² = c² → b = ±c. Assuming b ≠ c, then b = -c.

But then, with the slopes: slope of GH is b/a, slope of HJ is c/a. Their product is bc/a² = (-c²)/a². To be perpendicular, this product should be -1. So (-c²)/a² = -1 → c² = a² → c = ±a. So combining with earlier, if c = ±a, then b = ∓c = ∓(±a) = ∓a or ±a depending on sign. So possible solutions.

For example, take a = 1, c = 1, then b = -1. So points:

H at (0,0), G at (1,-1), J at (1,1). Then GH length is √(1+1)=√2, HJ length is √(1+1)=√2, so equal. Then GJ length is distance between (1,-1) and (1,1): 2 units. Then, the triangle is right-angled at H. Yes, this works. So maybe the original problem had a typo, and the equality is between GH and HJ instead of GJ and HJ. 

Assuming that, then proceeding. Given that, the problem says GJ = 8, GH = 12, and HI = 4. Wait, but earlier we saw that if GH = HJ, then GJ is the hypotenuse, so GJ = √(GH² + HJ²) = √(2*GH²) = GH*√2. So if GH = 12, then GJ should be 12√2. But the problem says GJ = 8. So this contradicts. Therefore, even with this assumption, there's inconsistency. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that GH = HJ? Let me see. Given that, and with GJ being the hypotenuse, then GJ = GH * √2. So if GJ is given as 8, then GH = 8/√2 = 4√2 ≈ 5.656. But the problem says GH = 12. Still inconsistent. 

This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let me go back to the original problem statement again.

The question asks to find KJ, given that GJ = 8, GH = 12, and HI = 4. The answer choices are A. 2, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8.

Maybe I need to focus on the other parts of the problem, like the horizontal lines and parallels.

We know that Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal. Also, Line(K,J) exists. Let me try to visualize this. Assume H is at (0,0). Since Line(H,I) is horizontal, point I is somewhere along the horizontal line passing through H. Similarly, Line(H,K) is horizontal, so point K is on the same horizontal line as H. Wait, but Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is horizontally aligned with H. So if H is at (0,0), then K is at (k, 0) for some k. Similarly, Line(H,I) is horizontal, so I is at (i, 0) for some i.

Now, Line(K,J) is mentioned. So point J is connected to K. Also, Line(G,J) is vertical. Earlier, we tried assigning coordinates but ran into contradictions. Let me try again with the new info.

Suppose H is at (0,0). Since Line(G,J) is vertical, let's say J is at (a, b), and G is at (a, c). So vertical line x=a. Now, since triangle GHJ is right-angled at H, which is (0,0). The lines GH and HJ must be perpendicular. Let's calculate their slopes.

Slope of GH: (c - 0)/(a - 0) = c/a.

Slope of HJ: (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a.

Their product is (cb)/a². For them to be perpendicular, this product must be -1. So cb = -a².

Also, the length of GJ is |c - b|, since they are on the same vertical line. Given that GJ = 8, so |c - b| = 8.

Also, GH is the length from G(a,c) to H(0,0): √(a² + c²) = 12. So:

a² + c² = 144.

Also, from the perpendicularity condition, cb = -a².

So now we have:

Equation 1: a² + c² = 144.

Equation 2: cb = -a².

And |c - b| = 8.

Let me express b from Equation 2: b = -a²/c.

Substitute into |c - b| = 8:

|c - (-a²/c)| = |c + a²/c| = 8.

Multiply numerator and denominator:

| (c² + a²)/c | = 8.

But from Equation 1, a² + c² = 144, so substitute:

|144 / c| = 8 → |144 / c| = 8 → 144 / |c| = 8 → |c| = 144 / 8 = 18.

Thus, c = 18 or c = -18.

Case 1: c = 18.

Then from Equation 2: b = -a² / 18.

From Equation 1: a² + (18)^2 = 144 → a² = 144 - 324 = -180. Impossible.

Case 2: c = -18.

Then from Equation 2: b = -a² / (-18) = a² / 18.

From Equation 1: a² + (-18)^2 = a² + 324 = 144 → a² = 144 - 324 = -180. Again impossible.

Hmm, no solution here. What's going on? It seems that there's no real solution under these conditions, which suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my assumptions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating |c - b|. Let me recheck.

We have GJ is the vertical segment between G(a,c) and J(a,b), so its length is |c - b|. Correct. And we said |c - b| = 8.

But with c = -18, then b = a² / 18. From Equation 1, a² = 144 - c² = 144 - 324 = -180, which is invalid. So no solution. Therefore, this suggests that the problem's constraints are contradictory, or there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at J instead of H? Let me try that.

If the right angle is at J, then the legs would be HJ and GJ, and the hypotenuse GH. But the problem says RightAngle(Angle(G,H,J)), which is the angle at H. So no.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a different configuration. Let me consider that line GJ is vertical, and line HJ is horizontal? But earlier, we thought that line HJ is parallel to GJ, which would make it vertical too. But if line HJ is horizontal, then it's not parallel to vertical line GJ. So that would violate the IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J)) constraint. Hence, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelism is between Line(G,J) and Line(H,K)? Since there's a Line(K,J) mentioned. Let me think. If Line(G,J) is vertical, and Line(H,K) is horizontal, then they aren't parallel. Unless there's another relation.

Wait, the problem mentions:

IsHorizontal(Line(H,I)

IsHorizontal(Line(H,K)

So both Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal. So points I and K are on the same horizontal line as H. So if H is at (0,0), then both I and K are on the x-axis, since horizontal lines are y=constant. So Line(H,I) is horizontal, meaning I is at (i, 0), and Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is at (k, 0). 

Now, Line(K,J) is mentioned. So point K is at (k, 0), and point J is somewhere. We also have Line(G,J) is vertical. Let me assume that J is at (a, b). Then Line(G,J) is vertical, so G is at (a, c). 

Earlier, we had issues with the perpendicularity. Let me try again, using the current information.

Assume H is at (0,0). Let me define coordinates:

- H: (0,0)

- Line(H,I) is horizontal, so I is (i, 0)

- Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is (k, 0)

- Line(G,J) is vertical, so G and J are on the same vertical line x=a. Let J be at (a, b), G at (a, c).

- Triangle GHJ is right-angled at H, so GH ⊥ HJ.

Compute slopes:

Slope of GH: (c - 0)/(a - 0) = c/a

Slope of HJ: (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a

Their product is (cb)/a² = -1 (since they are perpendicular). So cb = -a².

Also, length GH is sqrt(a² + c²) = 12 (given GH = 12).

Length GJ is |b - c| = 8 (given GJ = 8).

So we have:

1. a² + c² = 144

2. cb = -a²

3. |b - c| = 8

From equation 2: b = -a²/c

Substitute into equation 3:

| -a²/c - c | = 8 → | -(a²/c + c) | = 8 → |a²/c + c| = 8

Multiply numerator and denominator:

| (a² + c²)/c | = 8

But from equation 1, a² + c² = 144, so:

|144/c| = 8 → 144/|c| = 8 → |c| = 144/8 = 18 → c = ±18

So c = 18 or c = -18.

Case 1: c = 18.

Then from equation 2: b = -a² / 18.

From equation 1: a² + 18² = 144 → a² = 144 - 324 = -180 → invalid.

Case 2: c = -18.

Then from equation 2: b = -a² / (-18) = a² / 18.

From equation 1: a² + (-18)^2 = a² + 324 = 144 → a² = 144 - 324 = -180 → invalid.

Same issue. No solution. So this suggests that the given constraints are inconsistent. But since the problem provides answer choices, there must be a way. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, the problem says "IsParallel(Line(G,J), Line(H,J)". Earlier, I assumed this meant Line(G,J) || Line(H,J), but maybe it's a typo and should be Line(G,J) || Line(H,K)? Or Line(G,J) || Line(I,K)? Let me assume that there's a typo and that the parallelism is between Line(G,J) and Line(H,K). Let's try that.

If Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,K), and Line(G,J) is vertical, then Line(H,K) is also vertical. Since Line(H,K) is horizontal (as per the constraint IsHorizontal(Line(H,K)), this would mean Line(H,K) is both horizontal and vertical, which is impossible unless it's a single point. Hence, contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelism is between Line(G,J) and Line(H,I)? Since Line(H,I) is horizontal, and Line(G,J) is vertical, they are not parallel. No.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelism is between Line(G,J) and Line(I,K)? But without knowing where I and K are, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Line(H,J) is parallel to Line(G,K)? Let me try that. If Line(H,J) is parallel to Line(G,K), and Line(G,J) is vertical, then Line(G,K) would have some slope. But without more info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different configuration. Let me try to use the given values: GJ = 8, GH = 12, HI = 4. Maybe focusing on finding KJ, which is the segment from K to J.

Given that Line(H,K) is horizontal, and Line(H,I) is horizontal, so K and I are on the same horizontal line as H. Let's say H is at (0,0), so K is at (k, 0), I is at (i, 0). 

Also, Line(K,J) exists. So J is connected to K. Let me assume J is at (a, b). Then, Line(K,J) is from (k, 0) to (a, b).

But we also have Line(G,J) is vertical. So G is at (a, c), since GJ is vertical. So G(a, c), J(a, b), H(0,0). 

Earlier, we had the problem with the perpendicularity. But let me try to ignore that for a moment and use the given lengths.

Given GH = 12: distance from G(a,c) to H(0,0) is sqrt(a² + c²) = 12.

GJ = 8: distance from G(a,c) to J(a,b) is |c - b| = 8.

So |c - b| = 8 → b = c ± 8.

Also, the triangle is right-angled at H. So vectors HG and HJ are perpendicular. Vector HG is G - H = (a, c), vector HJ is J - H = (a, b). Their dot product should be zero:

(a)(a) + (c)(b) = 0 → a² + cb = 0.

So a² = -cb.

Also, from GH length: a² + c² = 144.

Substituting a² = -cb into this:

-cb + c² = 144 → c² - cb = 144.

But b = c ± 8.

Let me substitute b = c + 8 first.

Case 1: b = c + 8.

Then c² - c(c + 8) = 144 → c² - c² - 8c = 144 → -8c = 144 → c = -18.

Then b = -18 + 8 = -10.

Check a² = -cb = -(-18)(-10) = -180. But a² cannot be negative. Invalid.

Case 2: b = c - 8.

Then c² - c(c - 8) = 144 → c² - c² + 8c = 144 → 8c = 144 → c = 18.

Then b = 18 - 8 = 10.

Then a² = -cb = -18 * 10 = -180. Again invalid. Same problem.

So no solution here. This suggests that the problem has no solution under these constraints, which is impossible since there are answer choices. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the constraints.

Wait, let's revisit the original problem. It says:

"IsParallel(Line(G,J)
IsParallel(Line(H,J)" 

Maybe this means that Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,J)? But that would mean Line(G,J) and Line(H,J) are parallel, but they share point J, so they must be the same line, which would mean G, H, J are colinear, making the triangle degenerate. But the problem says it's a triangle, so this is impossible. Hence, likely a typo. Perhaps it should be Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,K)? Let me assume that. 

Assume Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,K). Since Line(G,J) is vertical, Line(H,K) must also be vertical. But Line(H,K) is horizontal (given IsHorizontal(Line(H,K)). This is a contradiction. Hence, no.

Alternatively, maybe it's Line(G,J) is parallel to Line(H,I)? Line(H,I) is horizontal, so Line(G,J) must also be horizontal. But the problem says Line(G,J) is vertical. Contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelism is between Line(G,J) and Line(I,K)? If Line(G,J) is vertical, then Line(I,K) must also be vertical. But Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal. Let me see. If Line(H,I) and Line(H,K) are horizontal, then I and K are on the horizontal line through H. If Line(I,K) is vertical, then I and K must have the same x-coordinate, but since they are on the same horizontal line (y=0 if H is at (0,0)), then I and K would be at (x, 0) and (x, 0), same point. Not possible.

This is very confusing. Given that, perhaps the problem has a different configuration. Let me try to forget the coordinates and think geometrically.

Given that GHJ is a right triangle at H, with GJ = 8, GH = 12, and HI = 4. Need to find KJ.

Assume that HI = 4, and Line(H,I) is horizontal. Also, Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is horizontally aligned with H and I. Let me imagine that H is at the origin, I is at (4, 0), since HI = 4. K is also on the horizontal line through H, so K is at some (k, 0). Now, Line(K,J) connects K to J. We need to find KJ.

But where is J? From earlier, we had issues with the coordinates, but let's try to use the given lengths. Let me consider that in the right triangle GHJ, with right angle at H, GH = 12, GJ = 8. Wait, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. But here, GJ is one of the sides, and GH is another. If GJ is the hypotenuse, then it should be longer than GH. But GJ = 8 and GH = 12, which would mean GH > GJ, which is impossible. Hence, GJ must be one of the legs, and the hypotenuse is GJ or GH? Wait, if the right angle is at H, then the hypotenuse is GJ. So GJ should be the hypotenuse. But GJ = 8, GH = 12. This is impossible, as hypotenuse must be longer than either leg. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that the problem may have swapped the lengths. Maybe GJ is the leg, and GH is the hypotenuse? Let me try that. If GH is the hypotenuse, then GH = 12, and GJ is one of the legs, say 8. Then, the other leg HJ would be sqrt(12^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(144 - 64) = sqrt(80) = 4√5 ≈ 8.94. But the problem also mentions HI = 4, which might relate to this.

But how does HI = 4 fit in? If Line(H,I) is horizontal and HI = 4, then I is 4 units away from H. If K is another point on the same horizontal line, then KJ would depend on where J is.

Assuming that H is at (0,0), I is at (4,0), and K is at (k, 0). J is somewhere, possibly at (0, b) or similar. But need to satisfy the right triangle.

Wait, let's assume that in the right triangle GHJ, GH = 12 (hypotenuse), GJ = 8 (leg), and HJ = sqrt(12^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(80) = 4√5. But how does this connect to KJ?

If Line(H,I) is horizontal, and HI = 4, so I is at (4,0). Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is at (k, 0). Line(K,J) connects K to J. If J is at (0, b), then KJ would be the distance from (k,0) to (0,b), which is sqrt(k² + b²). But how do we find k and b?

But we need more relations. Maybe the fact that Line(G,J) is vertical. If GJ is vertical, then G and J are on the same vertical line. Let's say J is at (a, b), G is at (a, c). Since GJ is vertical, and GH is the hypotenuse. Wait, but if G is at (a, c) and H is at (0,0), then GH is from (a,c) to (0,0), and HJ is from (0,0) to (a,b). The right angle is at H. So GH and HJ are perpendicular. 

Let me calculate the lengths. GH length is sqrt(a² + c²) = 12. GJ length is |c - b| = 8. HJ length is sqrt(a² + b²). 

Since it's a right triangle at H, by Pythagoras: GH² + HJ² = GJ²? No, wait, the hypotenuse would be GJ if it's the side opposite the right angle. Wait, the right angle is at H, so the hypotenuse is GJ. So GJ² = GH² + HJ². So:

8² = 12² + (sqrt(a² + b²))^2 → 64 = 144 + a² + b² → a² + b² = -80. Impossible.

So again, contradiction. This suggests that the problem's constraints are flawed, but since it's a multiple-choice question, there must be a way. Perhaps the key is to ignore the inconsistencies and focus on the given lengths and the horizontal lines.

Given that HI = 4, and Line(H,I) is horizontal, and Line(H,K) is horizontal, so K is at some point on the horizontal line through H. Let's say H is at (0,0), I is at (4,0), and K is at (k, 0). Now, we need to find KJ. If J is somewhere, and GJ is vertical, let's assume J is at (0, b), so GJ is vertical line from G to J. If GJ is vertical, then G is at (0, c), and J is at (0, b), so GJ length is |b - c| = 8.

In the right triangle GHJ, with right angle at H, so GH is from (0,0) to (0, c), which is vertical, and HJ is from (0,0) to (0, b), which is also vertical. But this makes GH and HJ both vertical, hence colinear, making the triangle degenerate. Not possible. Hence, this approach fails.

Maybe J is not on the y-axis. Let me try to assume that GJ is vertical, so G and J are on a vertical line. Let me say J is at (a, b), G is at (a, c). H is at (0,0). The right angle is at H, so GH and HJ are perpendicular. Vector GH is (a, c), vector HJ is (a, b). Their dot product is a*a + c*b = 0 → a² + cb = 0.

Length GH is sqrt(a² + c²) = 12.

Length GJ is |b - c| = 8.

So we have:

1. a² + c² = 144

2. a² + cb = 0 → cb = -a²

3. |b - c| = 8

From 2: b = -a²/c.

Substitute into 3: | -a²/c - c | = 8 → | -a²/c - c | = 8 → | -(a² + c²)/c | = 8 → | -144/c | = 8 → 144/|c| = 8 → |c| = 18 → c = ±18.

As before, this leads to a² = 144 - c² = 144 - 324 = -180, which is impossible. So no solution.

At this point, I'm stuck. The problem's constraints seem inconsistent, but since there are answer choices, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the triangle is not right-angled at H, but at G or J? Let me check the problem statement again: RightAngle(Angle(G,H,J)), which means the angle at H is the right angle. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the lengths are switched? Like GJ = 12 and GH = 8? Let me try that. If GJ = 12, GH = 8, then in the right triangle at H, GJ is the hypotenuse, so GJ² = GH² + HJ² → 144 = 64 + HJ² → HJ² = 80 → HJ = 4√5. Then, if HI = 4, which might be related to HJ? Not sure.

But how does this help with finding KJ? Let me assume that K is on the horizontal line through H, and J is somewhere. If HI = 4, and Line(H,I) is horizontal, then I is 4 units from H. If K is also on the same line, then KJ depends on where J is.

But without knowing the position of J, it's hard to say. Maybe K is such that KJ is the same as HI? Or some other relationship.

Alternatively, since Line(H,K) is horizontal and Line(H,I) is horizontal, and HI = 4, maybe K is at a certain position relative to I. For example, if K is such that KI = something, but without more info, it's guesswork.

Alternatively, since Line(G,J) is vertical and Line(H,I) is horizontal, and Line(H,K) is horizontal, maybe there's a rectangle or square involved. For example, if GJ is vertical, and HI is horizontal, then perhaps K is at the intersection of some lines.

But without clear relationships, it's difficult. Given that, and the answer choices, maybe the answer is 4, option B, as HI = 4 and KJ might be equal to HI. Or perhaps KJ is HI, which is 4. So answer B.

But this is just guessing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll go with B. 4.
