====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points S, Q, R, T, and P. The problem says that QP and QR are opposite rays. Wait, opposite rays mean they share the same endpoint and go in opposite directions, right? So if QP and QR are opposite rays, then point P must be on the opposite side of Q relative to R, or something like that. Hmm, maybe that means that Q is between P and R? Or that P and R are on opposite sides of Q?

Then it mentions that QT bisects angle SQR. So, angle SQR is being bisected by QT. Let me visualize this. Let's imagine point Q as the vertex of the angle. Then, the angle is formed by points S, Q, R. So, SQ and QR are two sides of the angle. Now, QT is the bisector of that angle. Therefore, QT splits angle SQR into two equal parts. But wait, there's also another part mentioned here: measure of angle TQR is given as 4x - 14, and the measure of angle SQR is 6x + 8. And we need to find the measure of angle SQT.

Wait, so since QT is the bisector of angle SQR, then angle SQT should be equal to angle TQR, right? Because an angle bisector divides the angle into two congruent angles. So if that's true, then angle SQT equals angle TQR. But wait, but the measures are given as 6x+8 for the whole angle SQR, and 4x-14 for angle TQR. Wait, but if QT is the bisector, then angle SQT would be half of angle SQR. Wait, no—wait, hold on. Let me think again.

If QT is the bisector of angle SQR, then angle SQR is split into two angles: angle SQT and angle TQR. So those two angles should be equal. Therefore, angle SQT = angle TQR. But according to the problem, m∠TQR is given as 4x -14, and m∠SQR is 6x +8. Since QT bisects angle SQR, then each of those smaller angles (SQT and TQR) should be half of the total angle SQR. Wait, but that would mean that angle SQT = (6x +8)/2, and angle TQR is also (6x +8)/2. However, the problem states that m∠TQR is 4x -14. Therefore, setting them equal:

(6x +8)/2 = 4x -14

Let me write that equation down:

(6x + 8)/2 = 4x -14

Multiply both sides by 2:

6x +8 = 8x -28

Subtract 6x from both sides:

8 = 2x -28

Add 28 to both sides:

36 = 2x → x=18

So then, substituting back, angle TQR is 4x -14 = 4*18 -14 = 72 -14 = 58 degrees. Then angle SQT is equal to angle TQR, which is 58 degrees. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 58. But let me check again because sometimes I might mix up the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me verify.

Wait, if angle SQR is 6x +8, and QT bisects it, then each of the angles SQT and TQR should be half of that. So:

m∠SQT = m∠TQR = (6x +8)/2

But according to the problem, m∠TQR is given as 4x -14. So set them equal:

(6x +8)/2 = 4x -14

Which leads us to solving for x:

Multiply both sides by 2: 6x +8 = 8x -28

Subtract 6x: 8 = 2x -28 → 2x = 36 → x=18

Therefore, m∠TQR = 4(18) -14 = 72 -14 = 58. Hence, m∠SQT is also 58 degrees. So the answer would be D. But wait, let me make sure there isn't a misunderstanding in the angle labels.

Wait, the problem says that QP and QR are opposite rays. So, if QP and QR are opposite rays, then P and R are on opposite sides of Q. That would mean that points P, Q, R are colinear with Q between P and R. So, the ray QP goes in one direction, and QR goes in the opposite direction. Therefore, the angle SQR is formed with vertex at Q, with one side QS and the other side QR. Then, QT is the bisector of angle SQR. So, the bisector QT would split angle SQR into two equal angles: SQT and TQR. Therefore, yes, angle SQT and TQR are equal. Therefore, my previous calculation holds.

But let me check once more. Suppose angle SQR is 6x +8, and QT bisects it, so each part is (6x +8)/2. Also, angle TQR is given as 4x -14. Therefore, equate them:

(6x +8)/2 = 4x -14

Which gives x=18. Then angle SQT is equal to (6x +8)/2. Plugging x=18:

(6*18 +8)/2 = (108 +8)/2 = 116/2 = 58 degrees. Which matches angle TQR. So angle SQT is 58 degrees. Therefore, answer D.

But wait, the answer choices include D as 58. So that would be the answer. But let me check if there's any possibility that angle SQT is different. For example, could there be some confusion about which angle is being referred to?

Another way to approach: Maybe angle SQT is the other part. Wait, if QT is the bisector, then angle SQT is half of angle SQR. Wait, but angle SQR is the entire angle, so if you bisect it, then each part is half. So angle SQT is half of angle SQR. But angle TQR is also half. Therefore, both are equal. Therefore, if angle TQR is 4x -14, then angle SQT is same value. Therefore, answer is 58, which is D.

Alternatively, if someone thought that angle SQT was the other angle, but no, since QT is the bisector, splitting angle SQR into SQT and TQR. So angle SQT is adjacent to angle TQR, making up the full angle SQR. Therefore, their measures add up to 6x +8. But since they're equal, each is half. So, yeah, 58. Therefore, answer D. But let me check if the initial assumption that angle TQR is equal to angle SQT is correct. Yes, because the bisector divides the angle into two congruent angles. Therefore, angle SQT and TQR are congruent. Therefore, answer is D. So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle SQT $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup based on the given information:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \vec{QP} $ and $ \vec{QR} $ are **opposite rays**, meaning they lie on the same line through point $ Q $, extending in opposite directions. Thus, $ Q $ lies between $ P $ and $ R $, forming a straight line through $ Q $.
- $ \vec{QT} $ **bisects** $ \angle SQR $. This implies that $ \angle SQT $ and $ \angle TQR $ are **equal**.
- We are given:
  - $ m\angle SQR = 6x + 8 $
  - $ m\angle TQR = 4x - 14 $

Our goal is to compute $ m\angle SQT $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Angle Bisector Property**

Since $ \vec{QT} $ bisects $ \angle SQR $, it divides the angle into two equal parts:

$$
\angle SQT = \angle TQR
$$

This allows us to set up the equation:

$$
\frac{6x + 8}{2} = 4x - 14
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
6x + 8 = 8x - 28
$$

Now subtract $ 6x $ from both sides:

$$
8 = 2x - 28
$$

Add 28 to both sides:

$$
36 = 2x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 18
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ m\angle SQT $**

Recall that $ m\angle SQT = \frac{6x + 8}{2} $. Substitute $ x = 18 $:

$$
m\angle SQT = \frac{6(18) + 8}{2} = \frac{108 + 8}{2} = \frac{116}{2} = 58^\circ
$$

Thus, $ m\angle SQT = 58^\circ $.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle SQT $ is $ 58^\circ $, which corresponds to **Answer Choice D**.

---

**Final Answer: D**
