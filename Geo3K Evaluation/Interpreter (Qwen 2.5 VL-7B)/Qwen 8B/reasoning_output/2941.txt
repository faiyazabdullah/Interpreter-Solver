MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a square ABCD inscribed in a circle K. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. Let me start by recalling some concepts about squares and circles.

First, when a square is inscribed in a circle, all four vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle. That means the circle is the circumcircle of the square. Now, in such cases, the diagonal of the square becomes the diameter of the circle. Wait, right? Because the diagonals of a square are equal and they intersect at the center of the square, which would also be the center of the circle. So each diagonal of the square is a diameter of the circle.

The problem mentions several lines and points. Let me parse through the constraints again. Points A, B, C, D form a square. Lines AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the square. Then there are diagonals AC and BD. Also, it says that Line AD and Line BC are diameters. Wait, hold on. If AD and BC are diameters, then those lines should pass through the center of the circle. But in a square, the diagonals are the ones that are diameters. Wait, but AD and BC are sides? Wait no, wait. Wait, the square is named as ABD C? Wait, the square is called ABD C? Wait, maybe I need to check the order of the square. The original statement says Square(A,B,C,D). So the square has vertices A, B, C, D connected in order. So the square is ABCD, meaning the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Then the diagonals are AC and BD. 

But the problem states that IsDiameterOf(Line(A,D) and IsDiameterOf(Line(B,C)). Wait, so according to the constraints, line AD and line BC are diameters of the circle. But in a square, the diagonals are AC and BD. So if AD and BC are diameters, that seems conflicting unless the square is rotated or something. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the square is labeled differently. Maybe the square isn't labeled in order? For example, sometimes squares can be labeled with different orders. Wait, the problem says Square(A,B,C,D), which usually implies the order of the vertices is sequential around the square. So AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. Therefore, the diagonals would be AC and BD. However, the problem says that Line AD and Line BC are diameters. But in a standard square, AD is a side, not a diagonal. Wait, unless the square is labeled differently. Let me visualize.

Let me sketch mentally. Suppose the square is labeled clockwise as A, B, C, D. So starting at point A, moving to B, then to C, then to D, then back to A. In this case, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The diagonals would be AC (from A to C) and BD (from B to D). Therefore, the diagonals are AC and BD. However, the problem states that Line AD and Line BC are diameters. Wait, AD is a side, not a diagonal. Similarly, BC is another side. How can a side be a diameter?

This suggests that there might be an error in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the square is not convex or labeled in a non-standard way. Wait, but the problem also mentions RightAngle(A,B,C) and RightAngle(C,A,D). Let me check that. The first one is RightAngle(A,B,C), meaning angle at point B between points A, B, C. Since AB and BC are adjacent sides of the square, that makes sense because in a square, each angle is 90 degrees. Similarly, RightAngle(C,A,D) would mean angle at point A between points C, A, D. Wait, but if the square is ABCD, then point A connects to D and B. So angle at A between C and D? Hmm, that would require that CA and DA meet at A. Wait, if C is connected to A, then CA is a diagonal. So angle between CA and DA at point A. Which would be... Well, in a square, the diagonal divides the angle into two 45-degree angles. Wait, but since the square's internal angles are 90 degrees, splitting them with a diagonal would create 45-degree angles. So that matches the RightAngle(C,A,D) being a right angle? Wait, no. Wait, the RightAngle(C,A,D) refers to angle at A between C-A-D. So that angle would be formed by lines AC and AD. Wait, but AC is a diagonal and AD is a side. So the angle between AC and AD at point A. In a square, if you consider triangle ACD, which is a right triangle? Wait, but in the square, AC is a diagonal, AD is a side, and CD is a side. So angle at A between AC and AD would be part of the square's corner. Wait, but in reality, the angle between the diagonal AC and the side AD is 45 degrees. Because the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle into two 45s. So that would make the angle at A between AC and AD as 45 degrees, not a right angle. But the problem says RightAngle(C,A,D), implying that angle is 90 degrees. So there's a contradiction here. 

Hmm, so maybe the labeling of the square is different. Let me re-examine the constraints. The problem says Square(A,B,C,D). So the square's vertices are A, B, C, D in order. Then the lines mentioned include Line(A,C) and Line(B,D), which are the diagonals. The problem also says that Line(A,D) and Line(B,C) are diameters of the circle. Wait, but Line(A,D) is a side of the square, not a diagonal. Unless the square is actually a diamond shape, like rotated so that its sides are horizontal/vertical. Wait, but regardless of orientation, the sides remain the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is not labeled in order. Perhaps the square is ABD C, meaning that the order is A, B, D, C? That could change things. For instance, if the square is A-B-D-C-A, then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, CA. Then the diagonals would be AD and BC. Wait, that's possible! Let me think. If the square is arranged such that the vertices are A, B, D, C, then connecting A to B, B to D, D to C, and C to A. Then the diagonals would be AD and BC. Because in this arrangement, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So if the square is ordered A-B-D-C, then the diagonals would be A to D and B to C. Therefore, Line(A,D) and Line(B,C) would be the diagonals, hence diameters of the circle. 

Ah, that makes sense. So maybe the square is not labeled in the usual order. The initial mention of Square(A,B,C,D) might imply that the order is A-B-C-D-A, but based on the constraints given, the diagonals are AD and BC, which would only happen if the square is labeled in a different order. Therefore, the square is actually arranged such that the diagonals are AD and BC, making them diameters of the circle. 

So, in this case, the square is rotated such that its diagonals are aligned along the axes of the circle. Therefore, the circle's diameter is along AD and BC. Now, the question asks for the measure of a central angle. Central angles in a circle relate to arcs between two points on the circumference. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, each vertex lies on the circle. The central angle corresponding to an arc between two adjacent vertices would be 90 degrees, since the full circle is 360 degrees divided by 4 vertices. However, the problem might refer to a specific central angle mentioned in the constraints. 

Looking back at the constraints, there's an Angle(?) mentioned, possibly referring to a specific angle. Wait, the last line says "Angle($)"—maybe a typo, but perhaps it's supposed to represent a specific angle. However, the user hasn't specified which angle. Given that the problem is asking for the measure of a central angle, and considering the square is inscribed in the circle, the central angles corresponding to the sides of the square would be 90 degrees each. However, if the question is referring to the angle between two radii connecting to adjacent vertices, that's 90 degrees. Alternatively, if it's referring to the angle between two radii connecting to opposite vertices (i.e., the angle subtended by a diagonal), that would be 180 degrees, since the diagonal spans half the circle. 

But let me think again. Since AD and BC are diameters, then points A and D are endpoints of a diameter, as are B and C. Therefore, the central angle between A and D would be 180 degrees. Similarly for B and C. However, if the question is asking for the central angle between two adjacent vertices, say A and B, that would be 90 degrees. But the problem doesn't specify which angle. However, looking back at the constraints, there's also mention of IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)... Wait, the constraint says IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)... Wait, the exact wording was:

IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)
Angle($)

Possibly, this is indicating that the central angle between the lines AD and something else? Or maybe that the central angle related to line AD? Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the central angle subtended by a certain arc. 

Alternatively, since AD is a diameter, then any angle subtended by AD at the circumference would be a right angle. But that's Thales' theorem. However, the question is about a central angle. The central angle corresponding to the diameter AD would be 180 degrees, as it spans half the circle. 

But the answer choices include 45, 60, 90, 180. So if the central angle in question is the one subtended by a side of the square (like AB), then it would be 90 degrees. If it's subtended by a diagonal (AD), it's 180 degrees. But since the problem mentions "a central angle," without specifying, but given that the square is inscribed, and the diameters are AD and BC, maybe the question refers to the angle between two radii connected to adjacent vertices, which would be 90 degrees. However, if the angle is between two radii connected to opposite vertices (like A and C), that would be 180 degrees. But how do we determine which one the question refers to?

Wait, going back to the problem statement: "Find the measure of a central angle." Since the square is inscribed in the circle, and the diagonals are diameters, then each central angle corresponding to the arcs between the vertices would depend on the arc. Each side of the square corresponds to an arc of 90 degrees (since 360/4 = 90). The diagonals correspond to arcs of 180 degrees. However, the problem may be referring to a specific central angle mentioned in the constraints. 

Another clue: The problem includes multiple lines and points. The constraints mention IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,C) and IsDiagonalOf(Line(B,D). Wait, earlier, we thought that AD and BC were diameters. So if Line(A,C) is a diagonal, then that would be from A to C, which in a square would be another diagonal. Wait, but if AD and BC are diameters, then points A and D are endpoints of a diameter, and B and C are endpoints of another diameter. Wait, but if both AD and BC are diameters, then they must intersect at the center of the circle. In a square, the diagonals intersect at the center. So if AD and BC are both diameters, then they must intersect at the center. But in a square, the diagonals AC and BD are the ones that cross at the center. So if AD and BC are diameters, that would mean that AD and BC are perpendicular to each other? Because in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, but in a square, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. If AD and BC are diameters, then they would be two diameters crossing at the center, and since they're both diameters, they would be straight lines passing through the center. However, in a square, the sides AD and BC would normally not be diameters unless the square is degenerate or rotated. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach systematically.

Given that the square ABCD is inscribed in circle K. The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees. The diagonals of the square are AC and BD. These diagonals are diameters of the circle. Hence, the length of each diagonal equals the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the central angle subtended by each diagonal is 180 degrees. The central angle subtended by a side of the square would be 90 degrees. 

However, the problem states that Line(A,D) and Line(B,C) are diameters. This contradicts the usual property where the diagonals are AC and BD. Therefore, there must be a mislabeling of the square. It's possible that the square is labeled such that the sides AD and BC are the diagonals. Wait, that would only be possible if the square is labeled in a non-standard way. For example, if the square is labeled A, B, D, C, forming a square where the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. In this case, the diagonals would be AD and BC. Thus, these diagonals are the diameters of the circle. 

Therefore, in this scenario, the square is arranged such that the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. Then the diagonals are AD and BC. Hence, AD and BC are diameters. Therefore, the central angles subtended by AD and BC are 180 degrees. But the question is asking for the measure of a central angle. Depending on which angle they refer to, it could be 90 degrees or 180 degrees. 

If the central angle refers to the angle between two adjacent vertices (e.g., A and B), then it's 90 degrees. If it refers to the angle between two opposite vertices (like A and D), it's 180 degrees. 

But the problem mentions IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)... Wait, the exact wording in the constraints is:

IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)
Angle($)

Perhaps this indicates that the central angle in question is related to the line AD. Since AD is a diameter, the central angle corresponding to AD would be 180 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be 180 degrees. But option D is 180. However, let me verify once more. 

Alternatively, maybe the central angle refers to an angle formed by two radii connecting to adjacent vertices. For example, taking points A and B, the central angle between them would be 90 degrees. But if the question is about the angle between two radii that are diameters, like AD and BC, then the angle between AD and BC would be 90 degrees because they are perpendicular diameters. Wait, but in that case, the angle between two diameters would depend on their positions. 

Wait, if AD and BC are both diameters, then they intersect at the center of the circle. The angle between them depends on the position of the square. In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. So if AD and BC are diameters, then they must be perpendicular. Hence, the angle between them would be 90 degrees. But this is not directly answering the question unless the question is referring to that angle. 

However, the problem says "Find the measure of a central angle." Without more context, it's ambiguous. But given the options, and considering common problems, the most likely answer is either 90 or 180. If the central angle refers to the angle between two adjacent vertices (as in the arc between two neighboring points on the square), then it's 90 degrees. If it refers to the angle between two opposite points (diametrically opposed), then 180 degrees. 

Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the central angles corresponding to the arcs between the vertices are 90 degrees each. But the problem might be referring to the angle subtended by a diagonal. Wait, but if the diagonal is a diameter, then the central angle for that diagonal is 180 degrees. 

Alternatively, the problem may be referring to the angle formed by two radii connecting to the endpoints of a side of the square. For example, take points A and B. The central angle between A and B would be 90 degrees. 

But how do we know which one? Let me check the constraints again. There's a mention of IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,C) and IsDiagonalOf(Line(B,D). So Line(A,C) and Line(B,D) are diagonals of the square. In the previous analysis, if AD and BC are diameters, then the other diagonals would be AC and BD. Wait, but if AD and BC are diameters, then AC and BD would be chords, not necessarily diameters. 

Wait, suppose the square is labeled such that AD and BC are diameters. Let's assume that the square is rotated such that its sides are not aligned with the coordinate axes. Let me assign coordinates to clarify. 

Let me place the square in a coordinate system where the center of the circle is at the origin (0,0). Let’s suppose that AD is a horizontal diameter. So point A is (-r, 0) and point D is (r, 0), where r is the radius. Since AD is a diameter, its length is 2r. Now, since ABCD is a square, the distance between A and D should be equal to the side length multiplied by √2 (because the diagonal of the square is side*√2). Wait, but if AD is a diameter, then its length is 2r. So the diagonal of the square is 2r, meaning that the side length s satisfies s√2 = 2r → s = 2r / √2 = √2 * r. 

Now, the other vertices B and C need to be placed such that ABCD forms a square. Let's think. Starting from point A(-r, 0), moving to B, then to C, then to D(r, 0). Since it's a square, the side AB should be perpendicular to AD and of the same length. The vector from A to D is (2r, 0). To find point B, we need to move from A in a direction perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, the perpendicular direction is vertical. But since it's a square, the next side AB should be perpendicular to AD. Wait, AD is from A to D, which is horizontal. The side AB would be from A to B, which should be perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, AB should be vertical upwards or downwards. Assuming the square is above the x-axis. Let's take upwards. So from A(-r, 0), moving up vertically to B. The length of AB is s = √2*r. So point B would be at (-r, √2*r). Then from B, moving in the direction opposite to AD to reach C. Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using vectors. 

Alternatively, since AD is a diameter, and ABCD is a square, the other vertices B and C can be determined. Let me use complex numbers for simplicity. Let me model the square in the complex plane, with center at the origin. Let’s denote the square's vertices as follows: A and D are endpoints of a diameter, so A = -r and D = r on the real axis. The other two vertices B and C should be located such that ABCD is a square. 

To find B and C, note that in a square, the midpoint of the diagonals coincide. The midpoint of AD is the origin. The midpoint of BC should also be the origin. Let’s denote B as (x, y) and C as (-x, -y) since their midpoint is ((x + (-x))/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0,0). Now, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc. 

Distance AB: sqrt[(x - (-r))² + (y - 0)²] = sqrt[(x + r)^2 + y^2]

Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - x)^2 + (-y - y)^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + (-2y)^2] = sqrt[4x² + 4y²] = 2sqrt(x² + y²)

For ABCD to be a square, all sides must be equal. So AB = BC:

sqrt[(x + r)^2 + y^2] = 2sqrt(x² + y²)

Square both sides:

(x + r)^2 + y^2 = 4(x² + y²)

Expand left side: x² + 2rx + r² + y² = 4x² + 4y²

Bring all terms to one side:

x² + 2rx + r² + y² - 4x² - 4y² = 0

Combine like terms:

-3x² + 2rx - 3y² + r² = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

3x² - 2rx + 3y² - r² = 0

Additionally, since ABCD is a square, the angle at B should be 90 degrees. Alternatively, the vectors BA and BC should be perpendicular. Vector BA is A - B = (-r - x, 0 - y). Vector BC is C - B = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Their dot product should be zero:

BA • BC = [(-r - x)(-2x)] + [(0 - y)(-2y)] = 2x(r + x) + 2y² = 0

Thus:

2xr + 2x² + 2y² = 0 → xr + x² + y² = 0

From earlier equation: 3x² - 2rx + 3y² - r² = 0

We can substitute y² from the dot product equation. From the dot product equation:

x² + y² = -xr

Substitute into the earlier equation:

3x² - 2rx + 3y² - r² = 0 → 3(x² + y²) - 2rx - r² = 0 → 3(-xr) - 2rx - r² = 0 → -3xr - 2rx - r² = 0 → -5xr - r² = 0 → r(-5x - r) = 0

Assuming r ≠ 0 (radius can't be zero), then -5x - r = 0 → x = -r/5

Now, from x² + y² = -xr:

x = -r/5

Plug in:

(-r/5)^2 + y² = -(-r/5)r → r²/25 + y² = r²/5 → y² = r²/5 - r²/25 = (5r² - r²)/25 = 4r²/25 → y = ±2r/5

So coordinates of B are (x, y) = (-r/5, ±2r/5). Let's pick positive y for simplicity: B = (-r/5, 2r/5). Then point C, being (-x, -y) = (r/5, -2r/5).

Now, check if ABCD is indeed a square. Let's compute distances:

AB: distance from A(-r, 0) to B(-r/5, 2r/5):

Δx = (-r/5 - (-r)) = (-r/5 + r) = 4r/5

Δy = 2r/5 - 0 = 2r/5

Length AB: sqrt[(4r/5)^2 + (2r/5)^2] = sqrt[(16r²/25) + (4r²/25)] = sqrt[20r²/25] = sqrt(4r²/5) = 2r/√5

BC: distance from B(-r/5, 2r/5) to C(r/5, -2r/5):

Δx = r/5 - (-r/5) = 2r/5

Δy = -2r/5 - 2r/5 = -4r/5

Length BC: sqrt[(2r/5)^2 + (-4r/5)^2] = sqrt[4r²/25 + 16r²/25] = sqrt[20r²/25] = 2r/√5

Same as AB, good.

CD: distance from C(r/5, -2r/5) to D(r, 0):

Δx = r - r/5 = 4r/5

Δy = 0 - (-2r/5) = 2r/5

Length CD: same as AB and BC, 2r/√5

DA: distance from D(r, 0) to A(-r, 0): 2r, which is the diameter, as expected.

So all sides are equal. Now check the diagonals AC and BD.

AC: from A(-r, 0) to C(r/5, -2r/5):

Δx = r/5 - (-r) = r/5 + r = 6r/5

Δy = -2r/5 - 0 = -2r/5

Length AC: sqrt[(6r/5)^2 + (-2r/5)^2] = sqrt[36r²/25 + 4r²/25] = sqrt[40r²/25] = (2r√10)/5

BD: from B(-r/5, 2r/5) to D(r, 0):

Δx = r - (-r/5) = 6r/5

Δy = 0 - 2r/5 = -2r/5

Length BD: same as AC, (2r√10)/5

So diagonals AC and BD are equal, as expected. 

Now, since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonals AC and BD should be diameters. Wait, but in our calculation, the length of AC is 2r√10/5. But the diameter of the circle is 2r. So for AC to be a diameter, 2r√10/5 = 2r → √10/5 = 1 → √10 = 5, which is false. Hence, there's inconsistency here. This suggests that in this configuration, the diagonals AC and BD are not diameters, but AD and BC are diameters. Wait, AD is the diameter, as we set it initially. BC is from B(-r/5, 2r/5) to C(r/5, -2r/5). Let's calculate its length.

Length BC: sqrt[(r/5 - (-r/5))^2 + (-2r/5 - 2r/5)^2] = sqrt[(2r/5)^2 + (-4r/5)^2] = sqrt[4r²/25 + 16r²/25] = sqrt[20r²/25] = 2r/√5, which is not equal to 2r. So BC is not a diameter. 

Wait, this contradicts the initial assumption that BC is a diameter. What went wrong here?

Earlier, I assumed that AD is a diameter, and tried to construct the square such that BC is also a diameter. But in this configuration, BC is not a diameter. Hence, there's a mistake in my reasoning. 

Maybe the problem's constraints are such that both AD and BC are diameters. How is that possible? Only if the square is such that AD and BC are both diameters, which would mean they are both straight lines passing through the center and having length equal to 2r. 

Let me consider that AD and BC are both diameters. Let's assume the square is symmetric with respect to both AD and BC. For AD and BC to be diameters, they must intersect at the center of the circle. Let's assume that AD is horizontal, from (-r, 0) to (r, 0), and BC is vertical, from (0, -r) to (0, r). But in that case, the square would have to have vertices at A(-r,0), D(r,0), B(0,-r), and C(0,r). Connecting these points would form a square? No, because the distance between A(-r,0) and B(0,-r) is sqrt[r² + r²] = r√2. The distance between B(0,-r) and C(0,r) is 2r. These are unequal, so it's not a square. Hence, this configuration doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if AD and BC are both diameters and perpendicular, then the square would have to be positioned such that its vertices are at the ends of these diameters. For example, if AD is horizontal and BC is vertical, then the square's vertices are A(-r,0), D(r,0), B(0,r), C(0,-r). But connecting these points would form a rectangle, not necessarily a square. To be a square, the sides must be equal. The sides AB would be from (-r,0) to (0,r): length sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. Side BC is from (0,r) to (0,-r): length 2r. These are not equal, so it's not a square. 

Therefore, it's impossible for both AD and BC to be diameters of the circle while forming a square. This suggests that there's an error in the problem's constraints, or perhaps my interpretation is incorrect. 

Wait, returning to the problem statement: the user said "Square(A,B,C,D)" and listed various lines and points. The key might be that the square is named ABD C, meaning the order is A, B, D, C. So the square is A-B-D-C-A. Let me try this. In this case, the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. The diagonals would be AD and BC. Hence, Line(A,D) and Line(B,C) are diagonals. If these are diameters, then they are both diameters of the circle. 

Let me try to construct such a square. Assume the circle has center at O, and AD and BC are diameters. Let's place point A at (-r, 0) and D at (r, 0), so AD is horizontal diameter. Point B and C are at the ends of the other diameter. Let's assume the other diameter is vertical, so B is (0, r) and C is (0, -r). Now, connecting the points A(-r,0) -> B(0,r) -> D(r,0) -> C(0,-r) -> A(-r,0)? Wait, that would form a bowtie shape, not a square. Because the sides AB, BD, DC, CA would have lengths:

AB: from (-r,0) to (0,r): length sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2

BD: from (0,r) to (r,0): sqrt((r)^2 + (-r)^2) = r√2

DC: from (r,0) to (0,-r): sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2

CA: from (0,-r) to (-r,0): sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2

So all sides are equal. What about the angles? Let's check the angle at B. The vectors BA and BD. Vector BA is from B to A: (-r - 0, 0 - r) = (-r, -r). Vector BD is from B to D: (r - 0, 0 - r) = (r, -r). The dot product is (-r)(r) + (-r)(-r) = -r² + r² = 0. Hence, the angle at B is 90 degrees. Similarly for other angles. Hence, this forms a square. 

Wait, this works! So in this case, the square has vertices at A(-r,0), B(0,r), D(r,0), and C(0,-r). Connecting A to B to D to C to A. The sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA, each of length r√2. The diagonals are AD (from A to D) and BC (from B to C), which are both diameters of the circle. 

In this configuration, the square is rotated 45 degrees relative to the axes. The central angles between adjacent vertices would be 90 degrees, and the central angles between opposite vertices (like A and D) would be 180 degrees. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of a central angle. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, and the problem mentions IsCentralAngleBetweenLines(Line(A,D)... which likely refers to the central angle subtended by the diameter AD. Since AD is a diameter, the central angle corresponding to AD is 180 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be 180 degrees, which is option D. 

Alternatively, if the central angle refers to the angle between two adjacent vertices (like A to B), it would be 90 degrees. But the problem specifies that Line(A,D) is a diameter, so the central angle related to this line would be 180 degrees. 

Hence, the correct answer is D. 180 degrees.
