MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that we have a triangle ABC with sides a=14, b=48, and c=50. We need to find cos A. Wait, but first I should make sure which angle they're referring to. In triangles, usually, uppercase letters denote angles, and lowercase letters denote the lengths opposite those angles. So angle A would be at vertex A, and side a is opposite angle A. But wait, sometimes different notations can vary. Let me confirm.

The question mentions Angle(A,B,C), which would be angle at point B, since it's written as (A,B,C). Wait, no—angle notation is typically the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. But then the problem says Right(Triangle(A,B,C)), so the triangle is right-angled. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), meaning that the angle at B is a right angle? Because Angle(A,B,C) is angle at B. So the triangle is right-angled at B. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at B. 

But then, the sides given are a=14, b=48, c=50. Wait, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. However, if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle B is 90 degrees. So in that case, the hypotenuse would be the side opposite the right angle. Since angle B is the right angle, the hypotenuse would be AC. Therefore, side AC is the hypotenuse, so its length would be the longest side. Given the sides are a=14, b=48, c=50. Wait, but if the hypotenuse is c, then c should be the longest side. Here, c is 50, which is longer than 48 and 14. So that makes sense. So side c is the hypotenuse, which is opposite angle C. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. If the triangle is right-angled at B, then the sides adjacent to the right angle are AB and BC, and the hypotenuse is AC. So the sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Then, using standard notation:

In triangle ABC, side a is opposite angle A. So angle A is at vertex A, so side a is BC. Similarly, side b is opposite angle B, which would be AC. Wait, no—if angle B is the right angle, then side opposite angle B is AC. So side b is AC? Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation for the sides. For example, in some contexts, the sides are labeled as follows: side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. So if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle B is 90 degrees, making sides AB and BC the legs, and AC the hypotenuse. Therefore, side AC is opposite angle B, so that would be side b. Wait, that might not align with the given values. Let me try again.

Let me assign variables properly. Let me think: in standard triangle notation, each side is labeled with the lowercase letter corresponding to the opposite angle. So:

- Side a is opposite angle A, which is BC.
- Side b is opposite angle B, which is AC.
- Side c is opposite angle C, which is AB.

So if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle B is 90 degrees. Therefore, sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Therefore, side AC is the hypotenuse, which is side b (since it's opposite angle B). Wait, but according to the given values, the sides are a=14, b=48, c=50. So if side b is AC (hypotenuse), then AC = 48? But then the hypotenuse should be the longest side. But 50 is larger than 48. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe my assumption about which side corresponds to which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given sides are labeled differently. Let me check the problem statement again. It says:

"a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50"

But in the problem description, the triangle has lines AB, BC, AC. And the angle at B is a right angle. So, the sides AB, BC, and AC form the triangle. Let me consider that the sides AB, BC, and AC have lengths corresponding to a, b, c?

Wait, maybe the labels are different. Let me think. Suppose that in the problem, the sides are labeled as follows:

- Line(A,B) has length a = 14
- Line(B,C) has length b = 48
- Line(A,C) has length c = 50

Therefore, AB = 14, BC = 48, and AC = 50. Then, since angle at B is a right angle, triangle ABC is right-angled at B, so AB² + BC² should equal AC².

Check that: 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500. Which is 50² (since 50² = 2500). Yes! That works. So that means that the sides AB=14, BC=48, AC=50, forming a right triangle at B. 

Now, the question asks to find cos A. So angle A is at vertex A. In triangle ABC, angle A is at vertex A, between sides AB and AC. Wait, no. At vertex A, the angle is between sides AB and AC? Or between AB and AC? Wait, angle A is formed by sides AB and AC. Wait, no. Let me visualize the triangle. Points A, B, C with a right angle at B. So, imagine a right triangle with right angle at B. Then, vertex A is connected to B and C. So angle at A is between BA and CA. To compute cos A, which is cosine of angle at A.

In such a triangle, we can use the definition of cosine in terms of adjacent over hypotenuse. Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines. Wait, but since it's a right triangle, maybe it's simpler.

Alternatively, since we know the sides, we can use trigonometric ratios. For angle A, adjacent side is AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. Wait, no. Wait, in a right triangle, the cosine of an acute angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. So, angle A is at vertex A. The sides relative to angle A are:

- Opposite side: BC (which is 48)
- Adjacent side: AB (which is 14)
- Hypotenuse: AC (which is 50)

Therefore, cos A would be adjacent / hypotenuse. Wait, adjacent to angle A is AB? No. Wait, angle A is at vertex A. The sides adjacent to angle A are AB and AC. Wait, no. Wait, angle A is formed by sides AB and AC. Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but AB and AC are two sides meeting at A. Wait, AB is one leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

If the triangle is right-angled at B, then sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So, angle A is at vertex A. From point A, the sides are AB (length 14) and AC (length 50). Wait, but how does angle A relate to these sides?

Alternatively, maybe I should draw the triangle mentally. Point B is the right angle. So points A and C are connected to B. So AB is one leg (length 14), BC is another leg (length 48), and AC is hypotenuse (length 50). Now, angle A is at point A. So, in triangle ABC, angle A is between AB and AC. Wait, but AB is one leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. So the adjacent side to angle A would be AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. Therefore, cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AB / AC = 14 / 50 = 0.28. But none of the answer choices is 0.28. Wait, that can't be. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Wait, but maybe I got the adjacent side wrong. Let me think again. When you take angle A, the adjacent side would be the side that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. Wait, in a right triangle, the cosine of angle A is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent side is the one that is next to the angle, not the hypotenuse. So, angle A is at vertex A. The sides around angle A are AB and AC. Wait, AB is one leg (from A to B), and AC is the hypotenuse (from A to C). So the side adjacent to angle A would be AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. Therefore, cos A = AB / AC = 14/50 = 0.28. But this isn't among the answer choices. The options are 0.14, 0.48, 0.50, 0.96. Hmm. So something's wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the sides. Wait, perhaps I need to use the Law of Cosines instead. Let me recall that Law of Cosines states that for any triangle,

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C

Where angle C is opposite side c.

In our case, we want to find cos A. So angle A is opposite side a. Wait, but earlier confusion arises because of labeling. Wait, let me define the sides properly.

Given that the triangle is right-angled at B. So angle B is 90°, sides AB and BC are legs, AC is hypotenuse.

In standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. Therefore:

- Side a is opposite angle A → which would be BC (since angle A is at vertex A; the side opposite angle A is BC).
- Side b is opposite angle B → which is AC (since angle B is at vertex B; side opposite is AC).
- Side c is opposite angle C → which is AB.

Therefore, given that the sides are a=14, b=48, c=50. Wait, but if side b is AC (opposite angle B), then AC = 48? But earlier calculation showed that AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. Wait, this contradicts. So there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps the given a, b, c are not following standard notation. The problem states:

"a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50". So perhaps in this problem, the sides are labeled as follows:

- a is the length of BC
- b is the length of AC
- c is the length of AB

But that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation where a, b, c correspond to the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. So if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle B is 90°, so sides opposite angles A, B, C would be:

- a: opposite angle A → BC
- b: opposite angle B → AC
- c: opposite angle C → AB

Thus, given that, if the sides are a=14, b=48, c=50, then:

- BC = a = 14
- AC = b = 48
- AB = c = 50

But then, AB = 50, BC = 14, and AC = 48. Wait, but in that case, applying Pythagoras theorem: AB² + BC² = 50² + 14² = 2500 + 196 = 2696. AC² = 48² = 2304. These aren't equal, so that would not be a right triangle. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the correspondence of the sides may be incorrect. Therefore, I need to reconcile this.

Earlier, when I considered AB=14, BC=48, AC=50, then AB² + BC² = 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500 = 50², which matches AC². Thus, this configuration gives a valid right triangle. Therefore, in this case, AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. Now, mapping this to standard notation:

Standard notation says that side a is opposite angle A. So angle A is at vertex A, so the side opposite is BC. Therefore, side a = BC = 48. Wait, but the problem states a=14. Therefore, there's a conflict here. This indicates that the given labels a, b, c in the problem do not follow the standard notation. Instead, the problem defines a, b, c as the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC respectively? Or maybe another way.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement:

It says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Triangle(A,B,C)
Point(A)
Point(B)
Point(C)
Line(A,B)
Line(B,C)
Line(A,C)
Angle(A,B,C)
RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)
Right(Triangle(A,B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)
CosOf(Angle(A,B,C)
CosOf(45)"

Then later, the question says:

"a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find cos A."

So, the problem is giving the lengths of the sides as a=14, b=48, c=50. But based on the geometric constraints, the triangle is right-angled at B (since Angle(A,B,C) is the right angle). Therefore, the sides are AB, BC, and AC. Assuming that a, b, c refer to the lengths of AB, BC, and AC respectively. So:

- AB = a = 14
- BC = b = 48
- AC = c = 50

Which fits with the earlier calculation where AB² + BC² = AC² (14² + 48² = 50²).

Therefore, in this case, the sides are AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. Now, angle A is at vertex A. To find cos A, which is the cosine of angle at A.

In this scenario, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle,

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

Wait, but need to be careful with notation. Let me clarify: in standard Law of Cosines, for angle A, the formula is:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

where a is the side opposite angle A, b is the side opposite angle B, and c is the side opposite angle C.

But in this problem, the sides are labeled as AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. So, to apply Law of Cosines correctly, we need to identify which sides correspond to a, b, c in the formula.

Alternatively, since we know the triangle is right-angled at B, we can use basic trigonometry.

At angle A, the adjacent side is AB (length 14), the opposite side is BC (length 48), and the hypotenuse is AC (length 50). Therefore, cos A is adjacent over hypotenuse, which would be AB / AC = 14 / 50 = 0.28. But this is not among the answer choices. Hmm. So why isn't this matching?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to angle A as the angle between sides AB and AC, which would mean that the adjacent side is AB and the hypotenuse is AC. Wait, but in that case, yes, same thing. So cos A = AB / AC = 14/50 = 0.28. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I've misunderstood the labeling of the sides.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for cos of angle B? No, the question says "find cos A". Alternatively, maybe the given a, b, c are not AB, BC, AC but something else. Let me double-check the problem statement again.

The problem says:

"a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find cos A."

Given that the triangle is right-angled at B, and the sides are AB, BC, AC. So if the sides are labeled as a, b, c, but not necessarily corresponding to AB, BC, AC. Perhaps in this context, a, b, c are the lengths of BC, AC, AB respectively? Or another order?

Alternatively, maybe the problem follows the standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. Let me assume that.

Standard notation: side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, side c opposite angle C.

Since the triangle is right-angled at B, angle B is 90°, so side opposite angle B is AC. Therefore, side b (opposite angle B) is AC = 50. Then side a (opposite angle A) is BC, which would be 48. Side c (opposite angle C) is AB, which would be 14.

Therefore, in this case, the given values are a=BC=48, b=AC=50, c=AB=14. But the problem states a=14, b=48, c=50. So this is inconsistent. So the given a, b, c don't match standard notation. Therefore, perhaps the problem uses a different notation where a, b, c are the lengths of AB, BC, AC respectively.

Assuming that, then:

- a = AB = 14
- b = BC = 48
- c = AC = 50

Then, angle A is at vertex A. To find cos A, which is the cosine of angle at A. Using the Law of Cosines:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

Wait, no. Wait, in Law of Cosines, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, no. Wait, angle A is between sides AB and AC? Wait, angle A is at vertex A, between sides AB and AC. Wait, no. In triangle ABC, angle A is between sides AB and AC? Wait, AB connects A to B, AC connects A to C. So the angle at A is between AB and AC. Therefore, to apply Law of Cosines for angle A, we need to know the lengths of the sides adjacent to angle A and the side opposite.

Wait, Law of Cosines formula for angle A is:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

Where a is the side opposite angle A. So in this case, if we are using standard notation where a is opposite angle A, then a would be BC (since angle A is at vertex A, so the side opposite is BC). But earlier, we assumed that a=AB=14, which conflicts. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, let me forget standard notation and focus on the given data. Given that the triangle is right-angled at B, with AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. Need to find cos A.

In this case, angle A is part of the right triangle. So we can use trigonometric ratios.

In a right triangle, cos(angle) = adjacent / hypotenuse.

For angle A, the adjacent side is AB (length 14), and the hypotenuse is AC (length 50). Therefore, cos A = AB / AC = 14 / 50 = 0.28. But this is not among the answer choices. So either I'm miscalculating or misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me check the answer choices again: A. 0.14, B. 0.48, C. 0.50, D. 0.96. None of these is 0.28. So there must be an error in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: Use coordinates. Let me place the triangle on coordinate plane to calculate.

Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0), since it's the right angle. Then, since AB is one leg, let's put point A at (0,14) assuming AB=14. Wait, but AB could be horizontal or vertical. Let me decide:

Let me set point B at (0,0). Since it's the right angle, AB and BC are perpendicular. Let me assume AB is along y-axis and BC is along x-axis. So:

- Point B: (0,0)
- Point A: (0, 14) since AB=14
- Point C: (48, 0) since BC=48

Then, point A is at (0,14), point C is at (48,0). The distance AC is sqrt((48-0)^2 + (0-14)^2) = sqrt(48² + 14²) = sqrt(2304 + 196) = sqrt(2500) = 50, which matches. Now, angle A is at point A (0,14). What is the measure of angle A?

To find cos A, we can use vectors or coordinates.

Vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (0-0, 0-14) = (0,-14)

Vector AC is from A to C: C - A = (48-0, 0-14) = (48, -14)

The cosine of angle between vectors AB and AC is given by their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Dot product of AB and AC: (0)(48) + (-14)(-14) = 0 + 196 = 196

Magnitude of AB: sqrt(0^2 + (-14)^2) = 14

Magnitude of AC: sqrt(48^2 + (-14)^2) = 50

Therefore, cos(theta) = 196 / (14 * 50) = 196 / 700 = 0.28. Same result as before. Still 0.28. Not in the options.

Hmm. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the question. Wait, the problem says "find cos A", but maybe they meant cos B or cos C? Let me check.

If angle B is the right angle, then cos B is zero, which isn't an option. Cos C? Let's calculate cos C.

Using the same method, angle C is at point C (48,0). Vectors CB and CA.

Vector CB is from C to B: B - C = (0-48, 0-0) = (-48, 0)

Vector CA is from C to A: A - C = (0-48, 14-0) = (-48, 14)

Dot product: (-48)(-48) + (0)(14) = 2304 + 0 = 2304

Magnitude of CB: sqrt((-48)^2 + 0^2) = 48

Magnitude of CA: sqrt((-48)^2 + 14^2) = 50

Thus, cos C = 2304/(48*50) = 2304 / 2400 = 0.96. Which is option D. So if the question asked for cos C, the answer would be D. But the question asks for cos A, which is 0.28. Since this isn't an option, perhaps there was a mix-up in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the given sides are labeled differently.

Wait, the problem says "a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50". Maybe in this problem, a, b, c are the sides opposite angles A, B, C, respectively. So, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. Wait, but in this case, if angle B is the right angle, then side b (opposite angle B) is AC, which is 50. Then, side a is BC, which is 48, and side c is AB, which is 14. So given that, the sides are a=48, b=50, c=14. But the problem states a=14, b=48, c=50. So that would imply that the sides are swapped. If a=14, then it would be BC=14, but in reality, BC is 48. So this suggests that the problem may have swapped the labels.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different convention where side a is AB, side b is BC, and side c is AC. So in that case, a=AB=14, b=BC=48, c=AC=50. Then, using Law of Cosines for angle A:

Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

Wait, no. Wait, angle A is at vertex A, so the sides adjacent to angle A are AB and AC. Wait, no. Wait, Law of Cosines formula for angle A is:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos A

Wait, no. Wait, the Law of Cosines states that for any triangle, the square of a side equals the sum of squares of the other two sides minus twice their product times the cosine of the included angle. So for angle A, the included sides are AB and AC, and the opposite side is BC. Therefore:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos A

Plugging in the known values:

BC = 48, AB = 14, AC = 50

So:

48² = 14² + 50² - 2 * 14 * 50 * cos A

Calculate left side: 2304

Right side: 196 + 2500 - 2*14*50*cos A = 2696 - 1400 cos A

Set equal:

2304 = 2696 - 1400 cos A

Subtract 2696 from both sides:

2304 - 2696 = -1400 cos A

-392 = -1400 cos A

Divide both sides by -1400:

cos A = 392 / 1400 = 0.28

Same result as before. Still 0.28. But this is not an option. So this suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that the triangle is right-angled, and that the cosine of angle B is 45 degrees? Wait, no, the problem says:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)
Right(Triangle(A,B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)
CosOf(Angle(A,B,C)
CosOf(45)"

Wait, this part might be indicating that the cosine of angle B is 45? Or maybe it's part of the constraints. Wait, the line says:

"Right(Triangle(A,B,C)" — the triangle is right-angled.

"Angle(A,B,C)" — this is angle at B.

"RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)" — angle at B is right angle.

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)... Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)... — this might indicate that the lengths are equal? But in our case, they are not. Wait, no, the actual given values are a=14, b=48, c=50, so they are not equal. So perhaps this part is just describing the setup, not stating equality of lengths. 

Then, "CosOf(Angle(A,B,C) CosOf(45)" — this might mean that the cosine of angle B is 45 degrees? But angle B is a right angle (90 degrees), so its cosine is 0. But the problem says CosOf(45)? This seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there's a translation issue or formatting error in the problem statement. It might mean that the cosine of angle B is 45, but that would be impossible since cos(90°)=0. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should say angle A or angle C?

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different intended setup. Let me think. Suppose that the triangle is not right-angled at B, but rather angle A is 45 degrees, and we need to find cos A? But the problem says it's right-angled at B.

Wait, this is very confusing. Given that the problem provides a=14, b=48, c=50, and asks for cos A, and given that in the right triangle, cos A is 0.28, which is not an option, but if the question mistakenly referred to angle C, then cos C is 0.96, which is option D. Given that 0.96 is close to 0.96, and the options include D, perhaps there was a mistake in the question, and it should be asking for cos C instead of cos A. 

Alternatively, maybe the given sides are different. Let me check if a=14, b=48, c=50, but if the triangle is right-angled at A or C. Let's test.

Suppose the triangle is right-angled at A. Then, AB and AC are legs, and BC is hypotenuse. Then, AB² + AC² = BC². With a=14, b=48, c=50, let's see: 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500 = 50². So this is possible. But then the right angle is at A, not B. So in this case, if the right angle is at A, then angle A is 90 degrees, and cos A = 0, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, suppose the triangle is right-angled at C. Then, AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse. So AC² + BC² = AB². Let's plug in: 48² + 50² = 2304 + 2500 = 4804. AB would be sqrt(4804), which is approximately 69.3, but the given AB is 14. Doesn't fit. So only possibility is right angle at B.

Back to original problem. Given that the correct value is 0.28, which is not an option, but the closest option is A. 0.14 (which is 14/100), or B. 0.48 (48/100). 0.28 is closer to 0.28, but none of the options match. However, if there's a miscalculation...

Wait, let me recalculate cos A using another approach. In the right triangle, angle A has opposite side BC=48, adjacent side AB=14, hypotenuse AC=50.

So, sin A = opposite/hypotenuse = 48/50 = 0.96

cos A = adjacent/hypotenuse = 14/50 = 0.28

sin A = 0.96, which matches option D (0.96). Wait, but the question asks for cos A, which is 0.28. But if the question mistakenly asked for sin A, then the answer would be D. But since it asks for cos A, and the options don't include 0.28, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the intended answer is D, assuming that the question wanted sin A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines the sides differently. For instance, if a=BC=14, b=AC=48, c=AB=50, but then this would not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Let's check: a=14, b=48, c=50. If it's right-angled at C, then a² + b² = c²? 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500 = 50², so yes! Wait, this is possible. So if the triangle is right-angled at C, then sides a=BC=14, b=AC=48, c=AB=50. Wait, but in this case, the right angle is at C. Let me verify:

If the triangle is right-angled at C, then sides AC and BC are legs, and AB is hypotenuse. So AC=48, BC=14, AB=50. Then, angle A is at vertex A. To find cos A.

In this case, angle A is at vertex A, between sides AB and AC. So adjacent side is AC (48), hypotenuse is AB (50). Wait, no. Wait, in this configuration, angle A is at vertex A, between AB and AC. Wait, AB is the hypotenuse (length 50), AC is one leg (length 48), and BC is the other leg (length 14). So, for angle A, the adjacent side is AC (48), and the hypotenuse is AB (50). So cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = 48/50 = 0.96, which is option D. Ah! This makes sense!

So the key was determining which angle is the right angle. Earlier, I assumed it was at B, but if the right angle is at C, then the sides would be a=BC=14, b=AC=48, c=AB=50, and angle A would have cos A = 48/50 = 0.96, which matches option D.

But how did I arrive at this? The problem stated that Angle(A,B,C) is the right angle. Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B, since it's the middle letter. So this implies the right angle is at B. But if that's the case, then the previous calculation leads to cos A = 0.28, which isn't an option. But if the right angle is at C, then Angle(A,B,C) would be angle at B, which is not the right angle. So this is conflicting.

Wait, let me parse the problem statement again. It says:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)" — this means that the angle at B (Angle(A,B,C)) is a right angle. So the right angle is at B. Therefore, the triangle is right-angled at B. Thus, the sides AB and BC are legs, and AC is hypotenuse.

However, in this case, the given sides are a=14, b=48, c=50. If a, b, c are the lengths of BC, AC, AB respectively, then BC=14, AC=48, AB=50. But then AB² + BC² = 50² + 14² = 2500 + 196 = 2696, while AC² = 48² = 2304. Not equal, so this is invalid. Hence, this suggests that the given sides cannot be BC=14, AC=48, AB=50.

But earlier, when I assumed that AB=14, BC=48, AC=50, then it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, implying the right angle is at B. In this case, the sides are AB=14, BC=48, AC=50. Now, if the problem defines a, b, c as the lengths of BC, AC, AB respectively, then a=BC=48, b=AC=50, c=AB=14. But the problem states a=14, b=48, c=50. So this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines a, b, c as the lengths of AB, BC, AC respectively. So a=AB=14, b=BC=48, c=AC=50. Then, the right angle is at B, and the calculation for cos A is 14/50=0.28, which is not an option. 

However, if the problem had defined a, b, c as BC, AC, AB respectively, then a=BC=48, b=AC=50, c=AB=14. Then, angle A is at vertex A, and to find cos A, we would use the Law of Cosines with sides:

- Opposite angle A is BC = 48 (side a)
- Other sides: AB = c = 14, AC = b = 50

Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

So 48² = 50² + 14² - 2*50*14*cos A

Calculate 48² = 2304

50² + 14² = 2500 + 196 = 2696

So 2304 = 2696 - 1400 cos A

Rearranged: 1400 cos A = 2696 - 2304 = 392

cos A = 392 / 1400 = 0.28

Still same result. 

But since this is not an option, and considering that if the right angle were at C, leading to cos A = 0.96 (option D), perhaps the problem had a typo and the right angle is at C instead of B. In that case, the answer would be D. Given that option D is present, and the closest logical conclusion, even though there's a contradiction in the problem statement, I'll go with D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to ask for cos C, which would be 0.96. Given that, and since 0.96 is an option, I will choose D.
