MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. The question says that the measure of angle 4 is 42 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 7. The answer choices are A through D. But wait, there's something missing here—the problem mentions "Angle(4)" and "Angle(7)", but it doesn't specify the type of angles or their relationship. Hmm, maybe there's some standard configuration they're referring to?

Wait, in many geometry problems involving angles, especially when dealing with parallel lines and transversals, angles can have specific relationships like corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, consecutive interior angles, etc. Since angles 4 and 7 are mentioned, perhaps they are part of such a scenario? Let me think. 

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles (also called same-side interior angles) are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. So if angle 4 and angle 7 are either corresponding, alternate, or consecutive, that would determine their measures.

But without knowing the exact diagram or the positions of these angles, I need to make assumptions based on common scenarios. Another possibility is that these angles might be vertical angles, which are always equal. However, vertical angles are formed by intersecting lines, so unless specified, that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe they are supplementary or complementary?

Let me consider different cases:

Case 1: If angles 4 and 7 are vertical angles, then they should be equal. So if angle 4 is 42°, angle 7 would also be 42°, which would mean answer A. But since the problem didn't mention them being vertical, maybe that's not the case.

Case 2: If they are corresponding angles, then again they'd be equal. Same as above, leading to answer A. But again, unless told that the lines are parallel, we can't assume that. Wait, maybe the original problem had a diagram that was supposed to accompany it? Since the user hasn't provided the diagram, maybe there's a standard assumption here?

Alternatively, maybe they are supplementary. For example, if they are consecutive interior angles (same-side interior), then they would add up to 180°. In that case, angle 7 would be 180 - 42 = 138°, which is option D. That seems plausible.

Another thought: sometimes angles can be related through triangle properties. For instance, if angles 4 and 7 are angles in a triangle, but that's unclear. Or maybe they are exterior angles?

Wait, another common scenario is when you have a transversal cutting two parallel lines, creating various angles. Suppose angle 4 and angle 7 are on the same side, making them consecutive interior angles. Then yes, they would sum to 180. But if they are on opposite sides, maybe they are congruent.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 and angle 7 are remote interior angles in relation to an exterior angle. Wait, for example, if there's a triangle with an exterior angle, then the exterior angle equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. But without more context, this is hard to tell.

Since the problem gives only the measure of angle 4 and asks for angle 7, and the answer choices include both 42, 48, 132, and 138, I need to think about the most probable relationship. Let's check the possible scenarios again.

If angles 4 and 7 are supplementary (sum to 180), then 180-42=138, which is option D. If they are congruent, then 42, which is option A. If they are complementary (sum to 90), then 90-42=48, which is option B. But which one is more likely?

In typical textbook problems, when two angles are formed by a transversal and parallel lines, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 4 and angle 7 are consecutive interior angles, then D would be the answer. However, if they are corresponding or alternate interior angles, then they would be equal, leading to A. But why would the answer not be straightforward?

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to angles formed by a transversal with two lines, where angle 4 is on one line and angle 7 is on the other. Without seeing the diagram, it's ambiguous. However, in many standardized tests, certain conventions are followed. For example, if angles 4 and 7 are in a situation where one is exterior and one is interior, maybe they are supplementary.

Alternatively, considering that angle numbers might correspond to positions. For example, in a diagram with multiple angles labeled 1 through 8, depending on how the lines are drawn. For instance, if angle 4 is an exterior angle and angle 7 is a remote interior angle, then angle 4 would be equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. But that requires more information.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 and angle 7 are vertical angles. But then again, without knowing the diagram, it's impossible to say.

Wait, maybe the problem is referencing a specific theorem or property that's commonly used. For example, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180. But again, without knowing the configuration, it's tricky.

Wait, but the problem includes MeasureOf(Angle(4)) and MeasureOf(Angle(7)). Maybe there's a typo or mislabeling? Like, could angle 4 and 7 be adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Then they would be supplementary. If that's the case, then angle 7 would be 138°, which is option D.

Alternatively, if angle 4 and 7 are vertical angles, then they are equal. But again, without knowing, it's uncertain. However, in many textbooks, problems often involve supplementary angles when discussing transversals with parallel lines. Also, 138 is a common supplement to 42.

Given that the answer options include 138, which is 180 - 42, and given that in many problems angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal have supplementary or congruent pairs, I'm leaning towards D. But I need to confirm.

Let me think again. If angle 4 and angle 7 are consecutive interior angles (on the same side), then they are supplementary. Hence, m∠7 = 180 - 42 = 138. Therefore, the answer would be D. 

Alternatively, if angle 4 and angle 7 are corresponding angles, then they are congruent. But why would the problem give angle 4 as 42 and ask for angle 7? It would be redundant if they were corresponding. Unless there's a mistake in the problem setup.

But since the answer choices include 138, which is supplementary, and given that without the diagram, the most common relationship between two angles formed by a transversal is either congruent or supplementary. Given that 138 is a valid answer, and the problem may have intended that, I'll go with D.

So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 7 $, we begin by analyzing the relationship between $ \angle 4 $ and $ \angle 7 $. While the diagram is not explicitly provided, we can infer a likely configuration based on standard geometric principles involving parallel lines and transversals.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Angles
When two **parallel lines** are cut by a **transversal**, several types of angles are formed:

- **Corresponding angles** are congruent.
- **Alternate interior angles** are congruent.
- **Consecutive interior angles (or same-side interior angles)** are **supplementary**, i.e., they add up to $ 180^\circ $.
- **Vertical angles** are congruent.
- **Linear pairs** (adjacent angles forming a straight line) are also supplementary.

The key detail here is that the measure of $ \angle 4 $ is given as $ 42^\circ $, and we are asked to find the measure of $ \angle 7 $. This implies that $ \angle 4 $ and $ \angle 7 $ are likely **consecutive interior angles**, which are **supplementary** in the case of parallel lines cut by a transversal.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Supplementary Angle Property
If $ \angle 4 $ and $ \angle 7 $ are **consecutive interior angles**, then:

$$
\text{m} \angle 4 + \text{m} \angle 7 = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting the known value:

$$
42^\circ + \text{m} \angle 7 = 180^\circ
$$

Solving for $ \angle 7 $:

$$
\text{m} \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Match the Result to the Answer Choices
From the list of answer choices:

- A. 42  
- B. 48  
- C. 132  
- D. 138  

We see that $ 138^\circ $ corresponds directly to **option D**.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
