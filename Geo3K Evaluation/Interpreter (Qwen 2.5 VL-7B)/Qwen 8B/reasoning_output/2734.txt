MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. The problem mentions a rectangle with points A, B, C, D. There are lines AB, BC, CD, DA, and it says that angles at B and D are right angles. Also, lines AB and BC are parallel. Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are already right angles, so maybe there's something else going on here?

Wait, the problem says IsRectangle(Shape(Rectangle(A,B,C,D)). So they're confirming that ABCD is a rectangle. But then why mention the right angles at B and D? Because in a rectangle, all four angles are right angles anyway. Maybe there's more to this problem that I'm missing? Or perhaps there's some diagram that isn't shown here? Since the question asks for x, which isn't mentioned in the constraints... Hmm, maybe there was supposed to be a diagram with specific measurements or angles labeled as x?

Wait, the original problem might have had a diagram where angle B or D is split into two parts, or maybe there's a triangle involved? But based on the information given here, there's no mention of x. Let me check again.

The user provided the constraints:

- Rectangle(A,B,C,D)
- Points A, B, C, D
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA
- RightAngle(Angle(B) and Angle(D)
- Parallel(Line(A,B) and Line(B,C)
- IsRectangle(Shape(...))

But the question is to find x. However, there's no mention of x in the constraints. This seems incomplete. Without knowing what x represents—like a side length, an angle measure, or something else—we can't proceed. 

Wait, maybe there was a typo or omission? Perhaps the original problem included a specific value or angle that wasn't copied here? For example, sometimes problems include angles like x in a triangle formed within the rectangle. If we assume that maybe angle B or D is being split into two angles, and x is one of them?

Alternatively, since all angles in a rectangle are 90 degrees, maybe there's a situation where two adjacent sides form a triangle with another line, creating an angle x that's part of that triangle. For instance, if there's a diagonal, splitting the rectangle into triangles, and x could be an angle in one of those triangles. In that case, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and create congruent triangles. Each triangle would have angles of 45 degrees if it's a square, but since it's just a rectangle, unless specified otherwise, the angles would depend on the sides' lengths. But without knowing the sides, how can we calculate x?

Alternatively, if there's a scenario where two lines intersect inside the rectangle forming angles, and x is one of those angles. For example, if two diagonals cross, making vertical angles. But again, without specifics, it's hard to tell.

Wait, maybe the problem was originally accompanied by a diagram where x is an angle measure, like in a triangle formed by connecting certain points. For example, suppose there's a point E such that AE is perpendicular to BD, forming some angles. But again, without seeing the diagram, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since the problem includes RightAngle(Angle(B) and Angle(D), but in a rectangle, all angles are already right angles. So maybe the problem is trying to confirm that the shape is indeed a rectangle, hence ensuring that all angles are 90 degrees. Then, if x refers to one of these angles, it would be 90 degrees, which is option C. That makes sense because all angles in a rectangle are right angles. Therefore, if x is one of those angles, the answer would be C. 90 degrees.

But wait, the problem didn't specify that x is an angle; it could be a side length. However, given the answer choices are numerical (30, 60, 90, 120), and considering that angles in rectangles are 90 degrees, it's possible that x is referring to an angle measure. Hence, the correct answer would be C. 90.

So even though the problem statement is incomplete without the diagram, based on the given constraints and the presence of right angles, the most logical conclusion is that x is 90 degrees, corresponding to option C.
