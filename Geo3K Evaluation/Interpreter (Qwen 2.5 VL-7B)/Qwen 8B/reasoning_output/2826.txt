====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ. First, I remember that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions some angles labeled as 1, 3, etc., so maybe there are specific points or lines involved here.

Looking at the constraints again. The rectangle has points W, X, Y, Z connected as lines WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Then there's a point O which is on line WX. Also, there are several right angles mentioned: Angle(O,9,10), Angle(O,11,12), and Angle(O,10,11). Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe those numbers refer to points? Let me parse that again.

The problem says: RightAngle(Angle(O,9,10)), RightAngle(Angle(O,11,12)), and RightAngle(Angle(O,10,11)). Hmm, perhaps these are angles formed at point O with different segments? Like, maybe O is connected to points 9, 10, 11, 12? But the original rectangle only has points W, X, Y, Z. Maybe there's more points introduced?

Wait, looking back, the problem mentions Point(O) and then Points 9, 10, 11, 12? Or maybe the labels are different. Wait, the initial constraints say:

- Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)
- RightAngle(Angle(W))
- Angle(Y)
- Point(W)
- Point(X)
- Point(Y)
- Point(Z)
- Line(W,X)
- Line(X,Y)
- Line(Y,Z)
- Line(W,Z)
- IntersectionOf(Line(W,X)) gives Point(O)
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(O))
- RightAngle(Angle(O,9,10))
- RightAngle(Angle(O,11,12))
- RightAngle(Angle(O,10,11))
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1))
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3))

Hmm, maybe the numbers 9,10,11,12 refer to other points? Or perhaps they are indices for the points? This part is unclear. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo and the numbers are actually labels for points. For example, maybe points 9,10,11,12 are other points related to the rectangle?

Alternatively, maybe the angles are referring to specific angles in the diagram. Since the problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(3), and asks for measure of Angle(3) given that measure of Angle(1) is 30 degrees. 

Let me think again. The key information is that WXYZ is a rectangle. So all internal angles are 90 degrees. Now, there is a point O on line WX. Then there are three right angles involving point O: Angle(O,9,10), Angle(O,11,12), and Angle(O,10,11). These might imply that O is forming right angles with certain lines or segments. 

But without knowing exactly how the points 9,10,11,12 relate to the rectangle, it's challenging. However, since the problem involves angles 1 and 3, and the question is about angle 3 when angle 1 is 30 degrees, maybe there's a triangle or some configuration where these angles are formed.

Another thought: In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other and are equal. If point O is somewhere along the diagonal, but the problem states that O is on line WX. Wait, line WX is one side of the rectangle. So O lies on side WX. Then, maybe lines from O to other points create triangles or other figures with angles 1 and 3.

Assuming that angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by connecting O to other vertices. For example, if O is on WX, then drawing lines from O to Y or Z could form triangles. Let's consider possible scenarios.

Suppose O is a point on WX. Let's imagine the rectangle WXYZ with W at bottom-left, X at bottom-right, Y at top-right, Z at top-left. Then, line WX is the bottom side. Point O is somewhere on WX. Then, if you connect O to Y (top-right corner), that would form a triangle. Similarly, connecting O to Z (top-left corner) would also form another triangle. 

Now, the problem mentions multiple right angles at point O. For instance, Angle(O,9,10) being a right angle. If these numbers refer to points, maybe 9,10 are points along the sides? But since the rectangle has only four points, maybe the labels are different. Alternatively, maybe the numbers correspond to the positions of the points in the rectangle. For example, maybe 9 refers to W, 10 to X, 11 to Y, 12 to Z? That could make sense if there's a numbering system. Let me check.

If the points are labeled as follows: W=9, X=10, Y=11, Z=12. Then, the angles mentioned would be:

- Angle(O,9,10): which would be angle at O between points 9 (W) and 10 (X). Wait, but if O is on line WX, then the angle at O between W and X would be straight, which is 180 degrees, not a right angle. So that can't be. Therefore, maybe the numbers refer to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the angles involve other lines. For example, if O is connected to other points. Suppose O is connected to Y and Z, creating triangles. Then, the right angles mentioned could be angles at O between different lines. For example, if there's a right angle at O between OY and OZ, but that would require O to be such that OY is perpendicular to OZ. 

Alternatively, maybe O is connected to two other points, making a right angle. Let's suppose that. For instance, if O is connected to Y and Z, then angle YOZ is a right angle. But how does that fit into the given constraints?

Alternatively, maybe the right angles at O are between different segments. For example, if there are two lines through O that are perpendicular. Given that O is on WX, perhaps there are two lines passing through O that are perpendicular, leading to those right angles.

But the problem states three right angles: Angle(O,9,10), Angle(O,11,12), and Angle(O,10,11). Assuming that these are angles at O formed by three different pairs of points. Let's assume that 9,10,11,12 refer to points in the rectangle. For example, maybe 9=W, 10=X, 11=Y, 12=Z. Then:

- Angle(O,9,10) would be angle at O between W and X. But since O is on WX, this angle would be 180 degrees, which isn't a right angle. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the notation means something else. Maybe the first letter is the vertex, followed by two other points. For example, Angle(O,9,10) is the angle at point 9 between points O and 10? No, that wouldn't make sense. Or maybe the angle is at point O, with segments going to 9 and 10. So, for example, Angle(O,9,10) is the angle at O between points 9 and 10. Wait, but that would mean the angle is formed by lines O9 and O10. So, if 9 and 10 are two other points, then this angle would be at O between those two lines.

So, assuming that 9,10,11,12 are points in the diagram. But since the rectangle only has four points, maybe those are additional points created by intersections or something. But the problem mentions IntersectionOf(Line(W,X)) giving Point(O). So O is on WX. Are there other lines intersecting here?

Alternatively, maybe the numbers 9,10,11,12 are just labels for other points, like auxiliary points. For example, if there's a line from O to Y, and O to Z, and maybe other points. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation where the angle is written as Angle(O,9,10) meaning the angle at point O between points 9 and 10. But if 9 and 10 are points on the rectangle, then maybe they're adjacent or something.

This part is quite confusing due to the notation. However, since the problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(3), and asks for measure of Angle(3) given that measure of Angle(1) is 30 degrees. Perhaps there's a relationship between these angles based on the rectangle's properties.

Let me focus on the fact that WXYZ is a rectangle. All angles are 90 degrees. There's a point O on WX. If we draw lines from O to other corners, we can create triangles. For example, connecting O to Y creates triangle OWXY, or maybe triangle OYZ or something similar.

Assume that angle 1 is one of the angles formed by these connections. For example, if O is connected to Y and Z, then maybe angle 1 is at O between OY and OZ. Wait, but if O is on WX, then OY and OZ would be two lines from O to opposite corners. Let's visualize this.

Imagine rectangle WXYZ with W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Then, point O is somewhere on WX, say at coordinates (o, 0), where o is between 0 and a.

Drawing lines from O to Y (which is at (a,b)) and from O to Z (at (0,b)). The angle between OY and OZ at point O would be angle YOZ. Is that a right angle? Let's calculate.

Vector OY goes from O(o,0) to Y(a,b): direction vector (a-o, b).

Vector OZ goes from O(o,0) to Z(0,b): direction vector (-o, b).

Dot product of OY and OZ vectors: (a-o)(-o) + b * b = -o(a - o) + b².

For them to be perpendicular, the dot product should be zero:

-o(a - o) + b² = 0 → -ao + o² + b² = 0 → o² - ao + b² = 0.

This equation depends on the position of O. Unless specific conditions are met, this isn't necessarily true. So unless O is chosen specifically, this angle isn't necessarily a right angle. Hence, maybe there's something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is one of the angles inside the triangles formed. For instance, if we look at triangle OXY or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by the intersection of diagonals or something. But since O is on WX, not sure.

Wait, the problem mentions "RightAngle(Angle(O,9,10))", etc. Maybe those are right angles formed by the lines from O. For example, if O is connected to two points such that those lines are perpendicular. If there are three right angles mentioned, maybe indicating that multiple lines from O are perpendicular to each other or to sides of the rectangle.

Alternatively, considering that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. If O is the midpoint of WX, then connecting O to the center of the rectangle would form certain angles. But again, without exact details, it's tricky.

But since the problem gives that measure of angle 1 is 30°, and asks for measure of angle 3. It's likely that angle 1 and angle 3 are complementary or supplementary angles within a triangle or quadrilateral, possibly related to the rectangle's structure.

Another approach: since the rectangle has right angles, and O is a point on one of its sides, drawing lines from O to other corners may form triangles with known angles. For example, if we take triangle OYZ, where O is on WX. Let's assume coordinates again for clarity.

Let’s assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s set W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Let’s say point O is on WX, so its coordinates are (o,0) where 0 ≤ o ≤ a.

Then, consider connecting O to Y and Z. The lines OY and OZ would form two lines from O to the upper corners. Let's find angles in triangle OYZ or other triangles.

First, consider triangle OYZ. Points O(o,0), Y(a,b), Z(0,b). What angles are present here?

At point O, angle between OY and OZ. Earlier calculation showed that this angle depends on o, a, and b. However, if there's a right angle at O in one of these angles, then maybe the triangle has specific properties.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is one of the angles in triangle OYZ, and angle 3 is another angle. If angle 1 is 30°, then using triangle properties, we can find angle 3.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by the intersection of lines from O to other points, and their measures are related via triangle sum or other geometric principles.

Wait, the problem also mentions "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1))" and "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3))". So maybe Angle(1) and Angle(3) are two angles that are equal? But no, the question says "Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠1 = 30." So they are different angles, and we need to find one based on the other.

Perhaps there's a triangle where angle 1 and angle 3 are parts of, and using triangle angle sum theorem. For example, if angle 1 is one angle, angle 3 another, and a third angle known.

Alternatively, since the rectangle has right angles, maybe there are right triangles involved. For instance, if O is connected to Y and Z, forming right triangles with the sides of the rectangle.

Let me think of a scenario where angle 1 is 30°, and angle 3 is the complement or supplement.

Suppose that in triangle OYZ, angle at O is 30°, then the other angles can be determined. But without knowing which angle is which, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if O is such that triangle OYZ is a 30-60-90 triangle. For example, if O is positioned so that one angle is 30°, then the other angles would be 60° and 90°, depending on the configuration.

But how would that relate to angle 3? Maybe angle 3 is the other acute angle in the same triangle. If angle 1 is 30°, then angle 3 would be 60°, making option C.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an external angle, relating to the interior angles.

Wait, another possibility: since O is on WX, and if there are perpendiculars drawn from O to other sides, creating right angles. For example, if we drop a perpendicular from O to ZY, creating a right angle. But again, without clear info on the exact construction, it's speculative.

However, given that the answer choices include 30, 45, 60, 90, and the given angle is 30°, it's plausible that angle 3 is either 60° (complement) or 90°, but since 90 is already a property of the rectangle, maybe not. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles or alternate interior angles, but without knowing the exact setup, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another idea: in a rectangle, if you draw a diagonal, it splits the rectangle into two congruent right triangles. If point O is on the side, maybe forming smaller triangles with certain angles. For instance, if O is the foot of the altitude from a corner, creating a 30-60-90 triangle.

For example, suppose we have a rectangle with width a and height b. If we draw a line from O to Y such that it forms a 30° angle with one of the sides. Then, using trigonometry, we could find relations between the sides, and hence determine other angles.

Let’s explore this. Assume that in triangle OYZ, angle at O is 30°, and we need to find another angle. For instance, if OY is one leg, OZ is another, but that might not directly apply.

Alternatively, consider triangle OXY. If O is on WX, then triangle OXY is a degenerate triangle because O is on the side WX. So that's not useful.

Wait, maybe angle 1 is at point O between OX and another segment. For example, if there's a line from O to some other point, forming angle 1 with OX. If that angle is 30°, then maybe angle 3 relates to that.

Alternatively, since there are three right angles mentioned at point O, maybe O is the intersection of two perpendicular lines, creating multiple right angles. For example, if O is the intersection of two perpendicular lines, then each pair of lines forms a right angle. If there are three right angles, that suggests multiple lines through O, each pair of adjacent lines forming right angles. That would mean that the lines through O are mutually perpendicular, implying that there are at least two perpendicular lines through O, but three right angles suggest more than two lines.

But if there are multiple lines through O, each pair forming right angles, that implies that the lines are perpendicular to each other. For instance, if there are three lines through O, each pair is perpendicular. That would require the lines to be arranged at 90-degree angles from each other. But in reality, through a single point, you can have at most two perpendicular lines (like x-axis and y-axis), and adding a third line would have to be aligned with one of them, making it not independent.

Thus, the mention of three right angles might indicate that there are two perpendicular lines through O, and the third angle is derived from that.

Given that, if O is on WX, and there are two lines through O that are perpendicular. For example, one line is WX itself (horizontal), and another line is vertical, perpendicular to WX. But since O is on WX, the vertical line would go upward from O. If that vertical line intersects another side of the rectangle, say at point P, then OP is vertical. Now, if there's another line from O to another point, maybe forming angle 1 and angle 3.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to connect it to the given data.

Since the problem includes that measure of angle 1 is 30°, and asks for measure of angle 3. Common angle relationships include complementary (sum to 90°), supplementary (sum to 180°), or specific ratios in special triangles (like 30-60-90).

If angle 1 is 30°, and angle 3 is its complement, then angle 3 would be 60°, which is option C. If they are supplementary, then angle 3 would be 150°, which isn't an option. If they are in a 30-60-90 triangle, then angle 3 could be 60°.

Given that the rectangle has right angles, and if angle 1 is formed by a line that creates a 30° angle with a side, then angle 3 could be the corresponding angle in a right triangle, making it 60°. Thus, option C.

Considering the answer choices and common geometric configurations, I'm leaning towards option C, 60°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the geometric constraints provided. We are told that **Quadrilateral $WXYZ$** is a **rectangle**, which means all its internal angles are **right angles (90°)**, and its opposite sides are parallel and equal. Additionally, **point $O$** lies on the side $WX$, and it forms **three right angles** with various segments, suggesting that lines through $O$ are **perpendicular** to each other.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **Understanding the Configuration**
- $WXYZ$ is a rectangle ⇒ All angles are 90°.
- $O$ lies on segment $WX$, which is horizontal in standard orientation.
- Multiple right angles are formed at point $O$, implying that lines through $O$ are **perpendicular** to each other.

#### 2. **Interpreting the Angles Mentioned**
- The problem defines **$\angle 1$** and **$\angle 3$** with the condition that $m\angle 1 = 30^\circ$.
- These angles are likely **angles formed by lines from point $O$** to other points in the rectangle, such as vertices $Y$ and/or $Z$.

#### 3. **Key Geometric Insight**
- Consider a situation where $O$ lies on side $WX$, and we draw lines from $O$ to both $Y$ and $Z$. These lines form two rays emanating from $O$, and the angle between them is $\angle 1 = 30^\circ$.
- The triangle formed by $O$, $Y$, and $Z$ is not necessarily a right triangle, but we know that:
  - $OY$ and $OZ$ are **not necessarily perpendicular** unless specified.
  - However, the presence of **three right angles** at point $O$ indicates that **multiple lines through $O$ are mutually perpendicular**, including lines like $OX$ and $OZ$, or $OY$ and $OW$, etc.

#### 4. **Using Triangle Angle Sum and Complementary Relationships**
- Suppose that the **two non-right angles in triangle $OYZ$** are $\angle 1 = 30^\circ$ and $\angle 3$, and that the third angle is a right angle (as suggested by the multiple right angles at $O$).
- By the **Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**, the sum of angles in a triangle equals $180^\circ$.
- If one angle is $90^\circ$, and another is $30^\circ$, then:
  $$
  \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ
  $$

---

### Final Conclusion:
From the above reasoning, the measure of $\angle 3$ is **60°**, which corresponds to **option C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
