MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. 

So we have triangle PQR with points P, Q, R. There's also points Z, Y, and X mentioned. The angles at various points are given in terms of variables like a, b, c. Specifically, we're told that RZ is an angle bisector. We need to find the measure of angle PRZ, which is given as 4b - 17. But first, we probably need to find the value of b using some relationships between the angles and maybe the lengths provided.

Let me list out all the given information:

Angles:
- Angle PRZ (at point R between P and Z) is 4b - 17 degrees.
- Angle ZRQ (at point R between Z and Q) is 3b - 4 degrees.
- Angle QYR (at point Y between Q and R) is 7b + 6 degrees.
- Angle PX R (at point X between P and R) is 2a + 10 degrees.

Lengths:
- ZQ = 3a - 11
- ZP = a + 5
- PY = 2c - 1
- YR = 4c - 11

Also, RZ is an angle bisector. So since RZ is an angle bisector in triangle PQR, it splits angle PRQ into two equal parts. Wait, angle PRQ is at point R, so the angle between PR and QR. Since RZ is the bisector, then angle PRZ equals angle ZRQ. Wait, but according to the given angles, angle PRZ is 4b - 17 and angle ZRQ is 3b - 4. If they are equal because RZ is the bisector, then those two expressions should be equal. Let me check that.

Wait, hold on. If RZ is the angle bisector of angle PRQ, then angle PRZ should equal angle ZRQ. Therefore, setting them equal:

4b - 17 = 3b - 4

Subtracting 3b from both sides gives:

b - 17 = -4

Adding 17 to both sides:

b = 13

Wait, so that would mean b is 13? Then plugging back into angle PRZ, which is 4b -17, gives 4*13 -17 = 52 -17 = 35 degrees. But wait, let me verify if this approach is correct.

But before that, let me think again. Is RZ the bisector of angle PRQ? Because angle PRQ is at point R, between points P and Q. So yes, if RZ is the angle bisector, then angle PRZ and angle ZRQ should be equal. However, looking at the given angles:

The angle PRZ is at point R between P and Z, so that's part of angle PRQ. Similarly, angle ZRQ is at point R between Z and Q. Hence, yes, these two angles are the two parts created by the bisector RZ. Therefore, they should be equal. Thus, equating them gives us the equation above, leading to b=13, making angle PRZ = 35 degrees. Which would correspond to option D. However, let me check if there are other constraints or equations involving b that might affect this.

Wait, but there's another angle given: angle QYR is 7b + 6. Also, angle PX R is 2a + 10. Are there other relations?

Additionally, there are length expressions involving a and c. For example, ZQ = 3a -11 and ZP = a +5. Maybe we can use the angle bisector theorem here. Since RZ is the angle bisector, the angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector. Wait, the angle bisector theorem says that in triangle PQR, if RZ is the bisector of angle R, then PQ / QR = PZ / ZQ. Wait, no, more accurately, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into the ratio of the adjacent sides. Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that if a bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. 

Wait, but here, the angle bisector is RZ. Wait, but does RZ meet the opposite side? In triangle PQR, the angle at R is being bisected by RZ. So the angle bisector RZ would intersect the opposite side PQ? Or is Z somewhere else?

Wait, the problem mentions points Z, Y, X. Let me re-examine the original problem statement for clarity.

Original problem mentions:

- Line(P,Q), Line(Q,R), Line(R,P): forming triangle PQR.

Then, angles:

- Angle(P,R,Z): So vertex at R, with sides RP and RZ. So angle at R between P and Z.

- Angle(Z,R,Q): vertex at R, between Z and Q. So same as previous angle, but perhaps different notation?

Wait, but earlier, the problem says:

Angle(P,R,Z) is 4b -17, Angle(Z,R,Q) is 3b -4. So these are two angles at R, which together form the entire angle at R in triangle PQR. Since RZ is the angle bisector, these two angles should be equal. Therefore, my initial thought was correct. Therefore, solving 4b -17 = 3b -4 leads to b=13, angle PRZ is 35 degrees. But why is there mention of other angles and lengths?

Wait, maybe there are more constraints. For instance, angle QYR is given as 7b +6. What is point Y? It's mentioned in the LengthOf(Line(P,Y)) and LengthOf(Line(Y,R)), which are PY and YR. So Y is a point such that PY = 2c -1 and YR = 4c -11. So perhaps Y lies on QR? Or some other line?

Similarly, X is mentioned in angle PX R, which is at point X between P and R. So maybe X is on some line?

But perhaps the key here is that there are multiple equations involving a, b, c. But since the question only asks for angle PRZ, which depends on b, maybe the values of a and c can be determined through other means, but perhaps they are redundant? Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps there are more equations involving angles. Let me think about the angles in the triangle.

First, considering triangle PQR. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. However, we have angles at R split into two parts by RZ. Let me consider angle at R: angle PRQ is equal to angle PRZ + angle ZRQ. Which would be (4b -17) + (3b -4) = 7b -21. Then, the other angles in triangle PQR are at P and Q. But do we have info on those?

Alternatively, perhaps there are other angles given. For example, angle QYR is given as 7b +6. Where is point Y located? Since PY and YR are given, maybe Y is on segment QR? If so, then triangle QYR has angle at Y. Wait, angle QYR is at Y, between Q and R. So if Y is on QR, then angle QYR would be a straight angle? No, unless Y is not on QR. Wait, perhaps Y is a point outside the triangle?

Alternatively, maybe Y is on some other line. Without more information, it's hard to tell. But maybe we can relate the angles. For example, if Y is on QR, then angle QYR could be related to other angles. Alternatively, maybe triangle QYR is involved in some way. But without knowing where Y is, it's challenging.

But since we have PY and YR expressed in terms of c, perhaps we can find c? But how? Unless there's another relation. However, the problem may not require using those. Wait, but the problem didn't state that RZ is the only angle bisector. Wait, but the problem says RZ is an angle bisector. So maybe there's more than one angle bisector? Or perhaps other relations?

Alternatively, maybe the angle measures at Y and X are connected via other triangles. For example, angle PX R is given as 2a +10. Point X is mentioned in that angle, so perhaps X is on some line. If angle PX R is formed at point X between P and R, then X might lie on some line, possibly on PR or something else. But again, without knowing where X is, it's difficult.

However, since the problem includes information about lengths ZQ and ZP, which are along the angle bisector RZ. So maybe applying the angle bisector theorem here. Let's recall the angle bisector theorem: In triangle PQR, if RZ is the bisector of angle R, then the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector. That is, PQ / QR = PZ / ZQ. Wait, but we don't know PQ or QR. However, we do know ZQ and ZP. Wait, ZQ is the segment from Z to Q, and ZP is from Z to P. Wait, but according to the angle bisector theorem, if RZ is the bisector of angle R, then it divides the opposite side PQ into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Wait, but in this case, the angle bisector RZ would divide the opposite side PQ into segments... Wait, but where is point Z located? Is Z on PQ?

Wait, the problem defines Z as a point such that lines are drawn from P to Q, Q to R, R to P, and also lines involving Z. But the problem says "Line(P,Q)", etc., so maybe Z is another point connected to R? Wait, the angles involve Z. For example, angle PRZ is at R between P and Z. So Z is a point connected to R, forming angle PRZ. So if RZ is the angle bisector, then Z must be on the angle bisector of angle R, meaning that Z lies somewhere such that RZ divides angle R into two equal parts. But without knowing where Z is located, perhaps it's on the extension of some side? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Z is inside the triangle? Wait, but in that case, the angle bisector would go from R to some point on PQ. But here, the angle is PRZ, implying that Z is connected to P and R. Wait, maybe Z is on side PQ? Let me think. Suppose RZ is the angle bisector of angle R. Then, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the sides adjacent to angle R (PR and QR) is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector. Wait, if Z is on PQ, then the angle bisector would split PQ into segments proportional to PR and QR. However, in our case, we have ZQ and ZP as lengths. Wait, but if Z is on PQ, then ZP and ZQ would refer to the segments of PQ. Wait, but the problem states LengthOf(Line(Z,Q)) and LengthOf(Line(Z,P)). So if Z is on PQ, then ZP and ZQ would be parts of PQ. But then, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the sides PR/QR = ZP/ZQ. 

But we have ZP = a +5 and ZQ = 3a -11. So PR/QR = (a +5)/(3a -11). However, we don't know PR or QR. So unless there's another way to express PR and QR. But maybe we can find a relationship from the angles? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe we can find 'a' using other angle information. For example, angle PX R is given as 2a +10. But again, without knowing where X is, it's unclear. However, if X is on some line related to the triangle, maybe PR? If angle PX R is at X between P and R, then X could be on PR extended, or somewhere else. But again, without knowing, it's tricky.

But perhaps there's another relation. Let me go back to the angles. Earlier, I considered that angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are equal due to RZ being the angle bisector, giving b=13. Then angle PRZ would be 35 degrees, which is option D. However, the presence of other angles and lengths suggests that there might be more constraints. For example, angle QYR is 7b +6. Maybe that angle relates to some other triangle? If Y is on QR, then triangle QYR would have angle at Y, and maybe we can apply some theorem. But how?

Suppose Y is on QR. Then PY and YR are segments. Given that PY = 2c -1 and YR = 4c -11. If Y is on QR, then PY would be a segment from P to Y, which is not on QR. So perhaps triangle PYZ or something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is a point such that PY is connected to some other element. This seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are supplementary or something. For example, angle QYR is 7b +6. If that angle is related to other angles in the diagram. But without knowing the exact position of Y, it's hard to say. 

But maybe there's another way. Let me check if there's a possibility that the angle measures add up to something. For example, in triangle PQR, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. Let's suppose we can write the angles at each vertex. At point R, we already have angle PRQ = 7b -21 (from earlier calculation when b=13). Then, the other angles at P and Q. But we don't have their measures directly. However, there's angle PX R given as 2a +10. If X is on PR, then angle PX R would be an external angle or something. But again, uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in certain triangles. For example, in triangle PRZ or ZRQ. But without knowing side lengths, it's hard. However, we have expressions for ZP and ZQ. Let me note that:

If RZ is the angle bisector, then by the angle bisector theorem, PR / QR = ZP / ZQ. From earlier, ZP = a +5 and ZQ = 3a -11. So PR / QR = (a +5)/(3a -11). But we need more information to connect this ratio to something else. Perhaps from the angles?

Alternatively, since we have angles at R, maybe we can use the Law of Sines in triangle PRZ and triangle ZRQ. Let me consider that. In triangle PRZ, we have angle at R is 4b -17, angle at Z? Not sure. Wait, but without knowing other angles or sides, it's complicated. However, if we assume that Z is on PQ, then in triangle PRZ and ZRQ, we could relate sides.

But even so, without knowing PR or QR, it's difficult. However, maybe combining with the previous ratio from the angle bisector theorem. Let's denote PR = x, QR = y. Then PR/QR = x/y = (a +5)/(3a -11). But we need another equation relating x and y. Maybe from the angles?

Alternatively, perhaps there's another angle relation. For example, the sum of angles around point R. Wait, angle PRZ + angle ZRQ = angle PRQ = 7b -21. And if we can find angle PRQ from other sources. But how?

Alternatively, let's consider triangle PQR. The angles at P, Q, R. Let me denote:

At R: angle PRQ = 7b -21.

At P: let's call it angle QPR = α.

At Q: angle PQR = β.

So α + β + (7b -21) = 180°.

But we don't know α or β. However, there's angle PX R = 2a +10. If X is on PR, then angle PX R would be an external angle to triangle PXR or something. Wait, if X is on PR, then angle PX R would be a straight angle? No, because X is a point on PR, so angle at X between P and R would be zero? That doesn't make sense. So likely, X is not on PR. Maybe X is somewhere else. 

Alternatively, perhaps X is on some other line. Since angle PX R is mentioned, maybe X is on the extension of some line. For example, if X is on the extension of PR beyond R, then angle PX R would be an external angle. But without knowing the exact location, it's hard to proceed. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me return to the initial assumption that b=13 based on the angle bisector. If that's valid, then angle PRZ is 35 degrees, which is option D. However, I need to ensure that there aren't conflicting conditions. For example, if b=13, then angle QYR = 7b +6 = 7*13 +6 = 91 +6=97 degrees. Does this create any contradictions? Well, unless there's another condition involving that angle. 

Similarly, angle PX R = 2a +10. If we can find a value for a, maybe from the angle bisector theorem. 

Earlier, we had PR / QR = (a +5)/(3a -11). But without knowing PR or QR, we can't find a numerical value. However, if we can find another relation involving a. 

For example, if we look at triangle PRZ and triangle ZRQ. Let me consider triangle PRZ: it has sides PR, RZ, ZP. Triangle ZRQ has sides QR, RZ, ZQ. If we can relate these using Law of Sines. 

In triangle PRZ:

sin(angle at P)/RZ = sin(angle at Z)/PR

Wait, but we don't know the angles. However, angle at R is 4b -17, angle at Z is unknown, angle at P is unknown. Similarly for triangle ZRQ. 

Alternatively, since angle PRZ = angle ZRQ = 4b -17 = 3b -4 (wait, earlier we set them equal, but if b=13, then angle PRZ is 35 degrees and angle ZRQ is 3*13 -4 = 35 degrees as well. So they are equal. So that's consistent. 

Therefore, if we take that b=13, then angle PRZ is 35 degrees, which is option D. 

But let me check if there are any other constraints that might invalidate this. For example, maybe the lengths ZQ and ZP must be positive. So ZQ = 3a -11 > 0 => 3a > 11 => a > 11/3 ≈ 3.666...

And ZP = a +5 >0, which is always true since a> -5. So no issue there. 

But what about angle PX R = 2a +10. If there's a constraint that this angle must be positive, then 2a +10 > 0 => a > -5, which is already satisfied. 

But without additional constraints, a could be any value greater than 11/3. But since the problem doesn't give more info about a, maybe it's irrelevant. 

Similarly, for c: PY = 2c -1 and YR = 4c -11. These must be positive, so:

2c -1 >0 → c > 0.5

and 4c -11 >0 → c > 11/4 = 2.75. So c must be greater than 2.75. Again, no specific value given, so maybe it's irrelevant. 

Thus, the only constraints we have are from the angle bisector theorem and the equality of the two angles at R. Solving that gives b=13, hence angle PRZ = 4b -17 = 35 degrees. Therefore, the answer is D. 

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible interpretation. For example, maybe the angle bisector isn't splitting angle PRQ but another angle? But the problem says RZ is an angle bisector, and the angles given at R are PRZ and ZRQ, which are adjacent and form the whole angle at R. Therefore, they must be equal. 

Hence, I think the correct answer is D. 35 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle PRZ $ in triangle $ PQR $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and the relationships provided in the problem.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Role of RZ as an Angle Bisector

We are told that **$ RZ $** is an **angle bisector** of $ \angle PRQ $. This implies that the angle bisector divides $ \angle PRQ $ into **two equal parts**, i.e.,  
$$
\angle PRZ = \angle ZRQ
$$

From the problem, we are given:
- $ \angle PRZ = 4b - 17 $
- $ \angle ZRQ = 3b - 4 $

Setting these equal because of the angle bisector property:
$$
4b - 17 = 3b - 4
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ b $

$$
4b - 17 = 3b - 4 \\
\Rightarrow b = 13
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute $ \angle PRZ $

Now substitute $ b = 13 $ into the expression for $ \angle PRZ $:
$$
\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 = 4(13) - 17 = 52 - 17 = 35^\circ
$$

---

### Step 4: Verify Consistency with Other Information

While the problem provides additional details about other angles and lengths (e.g., angles involving points $ X $, $ Y $, and $ c $), none of these are necessary to compute $ \angle PRZ $, as the angle bisector property alone suffices. Moreover, the other angle expressions (like $ \angle QYR = 7b + 6 $) and length expressions depend on $ b $, but they do not conflict with the derived value of $ b = 13 $.

All constraints remain consistent under this solution.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{D}
$$
