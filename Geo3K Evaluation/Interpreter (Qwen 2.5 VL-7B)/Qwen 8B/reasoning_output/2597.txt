MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So we have an equilateral pentagon PQRST inscribed in a circle U. We need to find the measure of arc QR, which is denoted as m∠QR. Wait, no—the question says m widehat QR, so that's the measure of the arc QR, right? Because in circle geometry, when they say m widehat AB, it refers to the measure of arc AB.

First, since the pentagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. But wait, in a regular pentagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's just mentioned as equilateral. Hmm. Wait, but it's inscribed in a circle. If a polygon is inscribed in a circle and is equilateral, does that mean it's also regular? Or can it be irregular?

Wait, for a polygon to be cyclic (inscribed in a circle), having all sides equal isn't sufficient for it to be regular. For example, a rectangle is cyclic (all angles are 90 degrees) but only squares are regular. However, in the case of a pentagon, being equilateral and cyclic might imply some specific properties. Let me think.

But maybe there's more information here. The problem lists several arcs between points. For instance, Arc(P,Q), Arc(Q,R), etc., up to Arc(T,P). Also, there are additional arcs like Arc(P,R), Arc(Q,T), etc. But perhaps those are just extra lines or maybe part of the diagram. Maybe the key thing is that the pentagon is equilateral and cyclic.

So first, since it's cyclic, meaning all vertices lie on the circle U. And since it's equilateral, all sides PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP are equal in length. Now, in a cyclic polygon, the lengths of the sides relate to the central angles subtended by each side. Since the pentagon is equilateral, these central angles should be equal? Wait, not necessarily unless it's regular. Wait, but in a regular pentagon, all central angles are equal. But here, even though the sides are equal, the central angles could vary? Wait, no—if the chords are equal, then their subtended arcs must be equal because in a circle, equal chords subtend equal arcs. Therefore, if all sides are equal chords, then all arcs between consecutive vertices must be equal. Hence, the pentagon would be regular. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought about rectangles. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, but adjacent sides aren't. However, in our case, all sides are equal. So if all sides are equal chords in a circle, then all arcs between consecutive vertices must be equal. Therefore, the pentagon must be regular. Hence, the central angles would all be equal. 

But wait, a regular pentagon has central angles of 360/5 = 72 degrees each. So each arc between two consecutive vertices would be 72 degrees. Therefore, the measure of arc QR would be 72 degrees. Then the answer would be B. But let me check again. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe the pentagon isn't regular. Suppose the pentagon is equilateral but not regular. Is that possible? Let me consider. In a circle, suppose you have five chords of equal length. Each chord corresponds to an arc. Since chords of equal length correspond to equal arcs, then yes, each arc between consecutive vertices would be equal. Thus, the total circumference would be 5 times that arc. Therefore, each arc would be 360/5=72 degrees. Hence, arc QR is 72 degrees. Therefore, answer B. 

But wait, the problem mentions multiple arcs, like Arc(P,R), Arc(Q,T), etc. Are these diagonals? For example, Arc(P,R) would be the arc from P to R, which skips a vertex. Similarly, Arc(Q,T) skips a vertex. But how does that affect things?

Wait, but the problem states that the pentagon is inscribed in the circle. So all the points P, Q, R, S, T lie on the circle. The arcs listed include both the sides and some diagonals. But maybe that's just extra information. The main point is that the pentagon is equilateral and cyclic. So regardless of the other arcs, the fact that all sides are equal implies equal arcs between consecutive vertices. Therefore, arc QR is 72 degrees. So answer B.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in cyclic polygons, even with equal sides, the angles can differ. Wait, but in a cyclic polygon, the side lengths determine the arcs. Since each side is a chord of the circle, and if all chords are equal, then all arcs are equal. Therefore, the arcs between consecutive vertices are equal. Therefore, the pentagon must be regular. Therefore, each arc is 72 degrees. So m widehat QR is 72 degrees, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's take an example. Suppose we have a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Each central angle is 72 degrees, so each arc is 72 degrees. So the measure of arc QR would indeed be 72 degrees. Therefore, the answer is B. But why are there other arcs listed? Like Arc(P,R), Arc(Q,T), etc.? Maybe those are just parts of the diagram, but they don't affect the calculation. Unless there's some trick here. Alternatively, maybe the pentagon isn't regular, but still equilateral. Wait, but if it's cyclic and equilateral, then it must be regular? Because chords are equal implies arcs are equal. Therefore, the arcs between consecutive vertices are equal, hence the polygon is regular. Therefore, the answer is B.

Wait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. What if the pentagon is equilateral but not regular, but still cyclic? For example, maybe the arcs between consecutive vertices are not equal. But if the chords are equal, then arcs must be equal. Because in a circle, chord length depends on the arc length. If two chords are equal, their arcs are congruent. Therefore, if all sides are equal chords, then all arcs between consecutive vertices are equal. Therefore, the pentagon must be regular. Therefore, arc QR measures 72 degrees. Therefore, answer B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the key geometric constraints:

- **Pentagon $PQRST$** is **equilateral**, meaning all its sides ($PQ$, $QR$, $RS$, $ST$, $TP$) are of equal length.
- It is **inscribed in a circle $\odot U$**, making it a **cyclic pentagon**.
- The goal is to find the **measure of arc $\overset{\frown}{QR}$** (i.e., the arc between points $Q$ and $R$).

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Implication of Equal Side Lengths in a Cyclic Polygon

In a circle, **equal chord lengths correspond to equal arc measures**. This follows from the theorem that *in a circle, equal chords subtend equal arcs*.

Since the pentagon is **equilateral**, all its sides are equal chords of the circle. Therefore, the arcs between **consecutive vertices**—namely, $\overset{\frown}{PQ}, \overset{\frown}{QR}, \overset{\frown}{RS}, \overset{\frown}{ST}, \overset{\frown}{TP}$—must all be **equal**.

Let’s denote the measure of each such arc as $x$. Since the entire circle is $360^\circ$, we have:

$$
5x = 360^\circ \Rightarrow x = 72^\circ
$$

Thus, the arc $\overset{\frown}{QR}$, which connects two consecutive vertices of the pentagon, measures:

$$
\boxed{72^\circ}
$$

---

### Step 2: Addressing Additional Arcs Mentioned in the Problem

The problem includes arcs like $\overset{\frown}{PR}, \overset{\frown}{QT}, \overset{\frown}{RT}$, etc.—these represent **diagonal arcs** connecting non-consecutive vertices. While these arcs may appear in the diagram, they do **not** impact the measure of arc $\overset{\frown}{QR}$, which is directly determined by the equal-length sides of the pentagon.

---

### Final Conclusion

Given that the pentagon is both **equilateral** and **cyclic**, the arcs between consecutive vertices are equal. This leads us to conclude that the arc $\overset{\frown}{QR}$ measures:

$$
\boxed{72^\circ}
$$

---

**Final Answer: B**
