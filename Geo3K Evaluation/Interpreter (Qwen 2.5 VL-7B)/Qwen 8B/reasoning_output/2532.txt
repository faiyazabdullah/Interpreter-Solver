MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out the constraints:

1. Circle(A): So there's a circle with center at point A?
Wait, no—actually, the notation might mean that point A is part of a circle? Or maybe it's a circle defined by some points? Hmm, the first line says "Circle(A)", which could imply that A is the center of the circle. But then it mentions Line(A,B), so AB is a diameter because it says "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B))". Wait, the second constraint is "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B)" which probably means that AB is the diameter of the circle centered at A? Wait, but if AB is the diameter, then the center would be the midpoint of AB. But if A is the center, then B would be on the circle, making AB a radius, not a diameter. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the circle has AB as its diameter, meaning that A and B are endpoints of the diameter. Then the center would be the midpoint of AB. But the initial statement was "Circle(A)", so maybe A is the center. This is confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe "Circle(A)" refers to a circle whose center is A. Then, "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B)" implies that AB is a diameter of that circle. Therefore, since the diameter is AB, the center would be the midpoint of AB. But if A is the center, then AB can't be a diameter unless B is diametrically opposite to A, but that would make AB a diameter only if the length from A to B is twice the radius. But if A is the center, then B would be a point on the circle, so AB would be a radius, not a diameter. There's inconsistency here. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the notation. Perhaps "Circle(A)" actually refers to a circle passing through point A? Or maybe the circle is named A? The notation is unclear. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that AB is the diameter of the circle, regardless of the label A. Let me set that aside for a moment.

Next, we have angles mentioned:

- Angle(A,D,C) – so angle at point D between points A, D, C.
- Angle(A,B,D) – angle at point B between points A, B, D.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)) – so these two angles are equal.
- Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) – so angle at C between A and B equals angle at D between A and C?
Wait, angle(A,C,B) is the angle at point C between points A, C, B. So that's angle ACB.

Then, SumOfAngles(A, Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(B,C,D)). So the sum of three angles: angle ADC (assuming Angle(A,D,C) is angle ADC?), angle ACB, and angle BCD (angle BCD). And they want us to find x, which isn't explicitly stated yet. Wait, the question says "Find x." But the problem didn't mention x directly. Wait, perhaps x is one of the angles mentioned? Maybe the angles are labeled with variables? Wait, the original problem might have had labels for angles, but in the translation here, it's missing. Maybe the angles are being referred to as x?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The last line says "SumOfAngles(A, Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(B,C,D)". So the sum of those three angles is something, and we need to find x. But without knowing which specific angle is x, it's hard to tell. However, given the answer choices are numerical (like 30, etc.), and the possible angles involved, maybe x is one of the angles in the sum, or perhaps the measure of one of them?

Wait, maybe there's more context missing. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram based on the constraints.

First, AB is the diameter of the circle. Let me assume that. So points A and B are endpoints of the diameter of a circle. Then, points C and D are somewhere on the circle. Because angles involving these points are mentioned. For example, angle ADC, angle ABD, angle ACB, angle BCD.

Let me sketch mentally:

- AB is diameter, so circle with diameter AB. Points C and D are on the circumference.

Now, angle ADC: since D is on the circle, and A and C are also points on the circle. Similarly, angle ABD: point B is one endpoint of diameter, D is another point. So angle ABD is formed by points A, B, D. Since AB is the diameter, BD is a chord.

Also, angle ACB: angle at C between A and B. Since AB is the diameter, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with AB as diameter, so angle ACB is a right angle (Thales' theorem). Wait, yes! If AB is the diameter, then any point C on the circle forms a right angle at C with triangle ABC. So angle ACB = 90 degrees.

But according to the constraints, angle(A,D,C) equals angle(A,B,D) and equals angle(A,C,B). So angle ADC equals angle ABD and equals angle ACB. But angle ACB is 90 degrees. So angle ADC and angle ABD are both 90 degrees? That would make sense if certain conditions hold.

Wait, but angle ADC is an angle subtended by arc DC, and angle ABD is an angle subtended by arc AD. Wait, maybe using properties of circles here.

But let me go step by step.

Given that AB is the diameter, so center O is the midpoint of AB. Let me consider coordinates for simplicity. Let me place A at (-1, 0) and B at (1, 0), so AB is horizontal, diameter of length 2 units. The circle has radius 1, centered at origin O(0,0).

Now, points C and D are arbitrary points on the circle. Let me assign coordinates. Suppose point C is at some position, say (x,y) on the unit circle. Then angle ACB is 90 degrees, as per Thales' theorem.

Now, angle ADC: Let me recall that angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. But angle ADC is an inscribed angle. Wait, angle at D between A and C. So points A, D, C. So angle ADC is formed by chords DA and DC. The measure of angle ADC depends on the arcs it subtends.

Similarly, angle ABD is the angle at B between points A, B, D. So angle ABD is formed by BA and BD. Since BA is the diameter, and BD is a chord from B to D.

If angle ABD equals angle ADC, and angle ADC equals angle ACB (which is 90 degrees), then angle ABD is 90 degrees. Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose angle ABD is 90 degrees. Then triangle ABD would have a right angle at B. But AB is the diameter. Wait, if angle ABD is 90 degrees, then point D lies such that BD is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal from (-1,0) to (1,0), then BD would be vertical. So point D would lie along the vertical line through B. But since AB is diameter, the circle has equation x² + y² = 1. Point B is (1,0). The vertical line through B is x=1. The intersection of x=1 with the circle is (1,0) itself, so D would coincide with B, which isn't possible. Hence contradiction. Therefore, my previous conclusion that angle ABD equals angle ACB (which is 90 degrees) leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions.

Wait, maybe angle ABD is not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, the constraints state that angle(A,D,C) equals angle(A,B,D) and equals angle(A,C,B). Earlier, I thought angle(A,C,B) is angle ACB, which is 90 degrees. But if angle ABD equals angle ACB, then angle ABD is 90 degrees. Which led to a contradiction. Therefore, either my interpretation of the angles is wrong, or there's something else.

Wait, let me re-examine the notation:

Angle(A,D,C) is angle at D between A-D-C. So vertex at D, with segments DA and DC.

Angle(A,B,D) is angle at B between A-B-D. Vertex at B, with segments BA and BD.

Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C between A-C-B. Vertex at C, segments CA and CB.

So angle(A,C,B) is angle ACB, which is indeed 90 degrees. So according to the constraints, angle ADC equals angle ABD equals angle ACB = 90 degrees. But earlier reasoning suggests that angle ABD can't be 90 degrees unless D coincides with B, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption about angle ACB being 90 degrees must be incorrect. Wait, why did I assume angle ACB is 90 degrees? Because AB is the diameter. According to Thales' theorem, if AB is the diameter and C is on the circle, then angle ACB is a right angle. But if angle ACB is supposed to be equal to angle ABD, which would require angle ABD to be 90 degrees, leading to a contradiction. Hence, there's a conflict here. Therefore, my initial assumption about AB being the diameter might be wrong? Or perhaps the circle is not centered at A? Wait, going back to the first line: "Circle(A)". Maybe that's not indicating that A is the center. Maybe it's just naming the circle as A? Like, circle A. Then AB is the diameter, so AB is a line segment which is the diameter of circle A. In that case, the center would be the midpoint of AB, not point A. So if AB is the diameter, then the center is the midpoint of AB. So A is just one endpoint of the diameter. That changes things. So earlier mistake was assuming A was the center, but actually AB is the diameter, so center is midpoint of AB.

Therefore, correcting that: AB is diameter, so center O is midpoint of AB. Then, angle ACB is 90 degrees (Thales' theorem). Now, angle ABD and angle ADC are equal to angle ACB (90 degrees). So angle ABD = 90 degrees. How is that possible?

Point B is an endpoint of the diameter. So angle ABD is at point B, between points A, B, D. So lines BA and BD form angle ABD. If this angle is 90 degrees, then BD must be perpendicular to BA. Since BA is the diameter from B to A (from left to right if AB is horizontal). So BA direction is from B to A, which is towards the left. So BD must be perpendicular to BA, i.e., upward or downward from B.

Since the circle has AB as diameter, point D lies on the circle. So if BD is perpendicular to BA, then D lies on the circle such that BD is vertical if BA is horizontal. Let me take coordinates again. Let me define coordinate system with AB as horizontal axis, with A at (-1, 0), B at (1, 0), so AB length is 2 units, center at (0,0). Then BA vector is from B to A, which is (-2, 0). Perpendicular to BA would be vertical direction. So BD is vertical upwards or downwards. So point D lies on the circle, on the vertical line through B. The circle equation is x² + y² = 1. At point B (1, 0), vertical line is x=1. Intersection with the circle gives (1, 0) and (1, 0) — wait, substituting x=1 into x² + y² = 1 gives y² = 0 → y=0. So only point B itself. Thus, no other point D exists on the circle on the vertical line through B except B. Hence, angle ABD cannot be 90 degrees unless D=B, which is invalid. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's a flaw in the problem setup, or my misinterpretation. Let me check again the angle measures. The problem states that angle(A,D,C) equals angle(A,B,D) equals angle(A,C,B). If angle(A,C,B) is 90 degrees, then both angle(A,D,C) and angle(A,B,D) are 90 degrees. But as shown, angle(A,B,D) can't be 90 degrees unless D=B. Therefore, there must be an alternative interpretation.

Alternative approach: Maybe angle(A,C,B) is not angle ACB. Wait, angle(A,C,B) is written as Angle(A,C,B), which is angle at C between A, C, B. Yes, that's angle ACB. So it's still 90 degrees. 

Another possibility: Could angle(A,D,C) not be 90 degrees, but instead angle(A,B,D) equals angle(A,C,B)? Wait, no—the problem says all three angles are equal: angle(A,D,C) equals angle(A,B,D) equals angle(A,C,B). So all three are equal. Hence, they all equal angle ACB, which is 90 degrees. Hence, same contradiction.

Wait, maybe the angles aren't all equal, but the problem says "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B))". So all three angles are equal. Hence, each of them is equal to angle ACB, which is 90 degrees. But that causes contradictions. So perhaps there's an error in the problem, or I'm misunderstanding the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps points C and D are not on the circle? But then how can angles like angle ADC and angle ABD be considered? Unless there are other elements.

Wait, the problem starts with Circle(A). Maybe A is the center. So if AB is the diameter, then A is the center, so AB is a radius. Wait, that would mean AB is a radius, not diameter. So diameter would be twice AB. But then if AB is a radius, then the diameter would be 2AB. But this contradicts the wording "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B)" implying AB is the diameter. So if A is the center, then AB is a radius, not diameter. So this seems inconsistent. 

Maybe the problem uses non-standard notation. Let me try to think differently. Suppose AB is the diameter, and A is not the center. Then the center is midpoint of AB. So let me denote the center as O. Now, points C and D are on the circle.

Angle ACB is 90 degrees. Angles ADC and ABD are also 90 degrees. As before, this leads to D being at B, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the angles are not all 90 degrees. Wait, the problem says that angle(A,D,C) equals angle(A,B,D) equals angle(A,C,B). So if angle(A,C,B) is not 90 degrees, then others are not. So maybe my assumption about angle ACB being 90 degrees is wrong? How?

Wait, angle ACB is the angle at point C between A and B. If AB is the diameter, then angle ACB is 90 degrees. But if AB is not the diameter, but just a chord, then angle ACB depends on the arc. Wait, but the problem states that AB is the diameter. So if AB is the diameter, then angle ACB must be 90 degrees. So this seems unavoidable.

Hmm. Given this contradiction, perhaps the problem involves multiple circles or other configurations? Or maybe the angles are not all in the same circle? Wait, the problem starts with Circle(A), so maybe all points are on circle A. So AB is the diameter of circle A, hence AB is a straight line passing through the center. Points C and D are also on circle A.

Wait, but even so, angle ABD being 90 degrees would force D to coincide with B, which is impossible. Hence, maybe the angles are not all 90 degrees, but equal to each other. Let me suppose that angle ACB is θ, angle ABD is θ, and angle ADC is θ. Let's try to express these angles in terms of arcs.

For angle ACB: since AB is diameter, angle ACB is half the measure of the arc AB that it subtends. Wait, no. Wait, angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. But AB is the diameter, so arc AB is 180 degrees. Hence, angle ACB is half of that, which is 90 degrees. So again, this brings us back to θ=90 degrees.

But then angle ABD: this is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD? Wait, angle at B, between A and D. So angle ABD subtends arc AD. The measure of angle ABD is half the measure of arc AD. Similarly, angle ADC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. Wait, angle at D between A and C, so it subtends arc AC. So measure of angle ADC is half arc AC. If these are equal, then arc AD = arc AC. So arc AD = arc AC. Hence, points C and D are symmetric with respect to the diameter AB? Or something like that.

Wait, but angle ABD = angle ADC. So arc AD = arc AC. So if arc AD = arc AC, then point D is located such that moving from A to D is the same arc length as from A to C. Depending on the position of C, D would be placed accordingly.

Additionally, angle ACB is 90 degrees. But if arc AC is something, then angle ACB is half the measure of arc AB minus arc AC? No, wait, angle at C subtended by AB. Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Hence, angle ACB is half of that, 90 degrees. So regardless of where C is on the circle, as long as AB is diameter, angle ACB is 90 degrees. Hence, θ=90 degrees. So angle ABD = θ=90 degrees, which implies that arc AD is 180 degrees. Wait, because angle ABD is half the measure of arc AD. So if angle ABD is 90 degrees, then arc AD is 180 degrees. So arc AD is semicircle. Hence, D is diametrically opposite to A. Wait, but AB is the diameter. If arc AD is 180 degrees, then starting at A, going 180 degrees around the circle lands at the point opposite to A, which would be the other end of the diameter. But AB is already the diameter, so the point opposite to A is B. Hence, arc AD being 180 degrees implies that D is at B. Again, contradiction.

This suggests that the only way for angle ABD to be 90 degrees is if D=B, which is invalid. Therefore, the only resolution is that my understanding of the angle measures is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps angle ABD is not an inscribed angle. Let me reconsider. Angle ABD is at point B, with segments BA and BD. BA is the radius, and BD is a chord. Is angle ABD an inscribed angle? No, because it's at the endpoint of the diameter. Wait, point B is on the circle, and BA is a radius. BD is a chord from B to D. So angle ABD is formed by BA (a radius) and BD (another chord). To find its measure, it depends on the arc it subtends. The measure of angle ABD is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. But which arc?

When you have an angle formed by two chords meeting at a point on the circle, the measure is half the intercepted arc. Here, angle ABD is formed by chords BA and BD. So the intercepted arc is arc AD. Hence, angle ABD = ½ arc AD. Similarly, angle ADC is formed by chords DA and DC, intercepting arc AC. So angle ADC = ½ arc AC. Given that angle ABD = angle ADC, so ½ arc AD = ½ arc AC ⇒ arc AD = arc AC. Hence, arc AD = arc AC. So point D is located such that moving from A to D is the same arc length as from A to C. So if arc AC is x, then arc AD is also x. 

Now, since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Let's consider the positions of points. Let me imagine the circle with diameter AB. Let's fix point C somewhere on the upper half-circle. Arc AC is some value, say α. Then arc AD is also α. So depending on where C is, D would be positioned such that arc AD is α. 

Now, angle ACB is 90 degrees, as before. But how does this relate to arc AC? Let me think. Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. Wait, no—angle at C, subtended by AB. Since AB is diameter, arc AB is 180°, so angle ACB is ½ * 180° = 90°. So angle ACB is always 90°, regardless of where C is on the circle. 

Now, angle ADC is ½ arc AC, as established. So angle ADC = ½ arc AC. But angle ADC is equal to angle ABD, which is ½ arc AD. And since arc AD = arc AC, then angle ADC = angle ABD = ½ arc AC. 

But angle ACB is 90°, which is fixed. So we have relationships between arcs. Let me attempt to write equations.

Let me denote:

arc AC = α  
arc AD = α (since arc AD = arc AC)  

Since AB is the diameter, arc AB = 180°. Let me consider the total circumference as 360°, so arc AB = 180°, arc AC = α, arc AD = α.

Now, depending on the positions of C and D, the rest of the arcs can be determined. For instance, if we consider the full circle, arc AC + arc CD + arc DB + arc BA = 360°? Wait, need to define the arcs properly.

Actually, since AB is a diameter, the circle is divided into two semicircles. Let me assume points C and D are on the upper semicircle (for simplicity). 

Let me consider the arc from A to C as α, and arc from A to D as α. So point C is α degrees away from A along the arc, and point D is also α degrees away from A along the arc. But since AB is the diameter, if we move from A to B along the arc, it's 180°. So if α is less than 180°, then points C and D are on the upper semicircle.

But then what about arc from C to D? It depends on their positions. Let me think of the circle with AB as diameter, points C and D on the upper semicircle. 

Assume that point C is α degrees counterclockwise from A, and point D is also α degrees counterclockwise from A. But then, if both are α degrees from A, then they would be the same point unless α is measured in different directions. Wait, but if α is measured clockwise from A, then D would be on the lower semicircle. But since we assumed points are on upper semicircle, maybe α is measured in the same direction. 

Alternatively, maybe arc AC is α, and arc AD is α, but in different directions? Not sure. Let me try to visualize.

Alternatively, let's consider that arc AC + arc CB = 180°, since AB is the diameter. So arc AC + arc CB = 180°. Similarly, arc AD + arc DB = 180°, since AB is diameter. 

But if arc AC = α, then arc CB = 180° - α. Similarly, if arc AD = α, then arc DB = 180° - α. 

Now, what about the relationship between points C and D? Let's see. 

If arc AC = arc AD = α, then points C and D are symmetric with respect to the diameter AB? Or not necessarily. For example, if α is measured in different directions. 

But let's focus on the angles mentioned in the problem. We need to evaluate the sum of angles: angle ADC, angle ACB, and angle BCD. Wait, the problem says "SumOfAngles(A, Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(B,C,D))". So the sum of those three angles: angle ADC, angle ACB, and angle BCD. And we need to find x, which is likely one of these angles or related to them.

Wait, the problem says "Find x." But x isn't defined. This is confusing. Maybe there was a typo, and x is one of the angles? For example, maybe the sum of these three angles equals x, and we need to find x? Or perhaps one of the angles is x? Since the answer choices are numerical, and the sum might involve x.

Assuming that the sum of the three angles mentioned is x, let's calculate it. Let's denote:

Let angle ADC = angle ABD = angle ACB = θ.

We know angle ACB = 90°, so θ = 90°. But earlier contradiction arises. However, let's proceed hypothetically.

If angle ADC = θ, angle ACB = θ, and angle BCD is another angle. What is angle BCD?

Angle BCD is the angle at point C between points B, C, D. So it's angle BCD. To find this, we can use properties of the circle.

Let me try to find angle BCD. Since points B, C, D are on the circle, angle BCD is an inscribed angle. It subtends arc BD. So measure of angle BCD is half the measure of arc BD.

From earlier, arc AD = α, and since arc AB = 180°, arc DB = 180° - α. Hence, arc BD = 180° - α.

Thus, angle BCD = ½ * arc BD = ½*(180° - α) = 90° - ½α.

Now, the sum of the three angles is:

angle ADC (θ) + angle ACB (θ) + angle BCD (90° - ½α).

But θ is equal to angle ADC, which is ½ arc AC. Arc AC is α, so θ = ½α. Wait, earlier we said angle ADC = ½ arc AC, which is ½α. But earlier, we also said angle ABD = angle ADC, which is ½ arc AD = ½α. Since arc AD = α, this holds. And angle ACB = 90°, which is separate.

Wait, but earlier we had angle ACB = 90°, and angle ADC = θ = ½α. But the problem states that angle ADC equals angle ACB, so θ = 90°, hence ½α = 90° → α = 180°. But arc AC = 180°, which would mean point C is at point B, which is invalid. Hence, contradiction again.

This suggests that our assumption that angle ADC = angle ACB is incorrect. Wait, but the problem says "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B))", so all three angles are equal. Hence, angle ADC = angle ABD = angle ACB. But angle ACB is 90°, so angle ADC = angle ABD = 90°. But this leads to arc AD = 180°, making D=B, which is invalid. Hence, this suggests that the only possible scenario is when D=B, but that's not allowed. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-express angle ADC. Angle ADC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. So measure of angle ADC = ½ arc AC. Similarly, angle ABD is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, so measure of angle ABD = ½ arc AD. These are equal, so arc AD = arc AC. Let's call this common arc length as β. So arc AC = arc AD = β. 

Angle ACB is 90°, as before. But angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, which is 180°, so it's ½*180° = 90°. 

But how does this relate to β? Well, arc AC is β, and arc AB is 180°. So arc CB = arc AB - arc AC = 180° - β. 

Now, what about angle ADC? It's ½β. And angle ABD is also ½β. And angle ACB is 90°. The problem states that all three are equal. So ½β = 90° ⇒ β = 180°. So arc AC = 180°, meaning point C is at point B. Again, contradiction. 

Hence, this suggests that under the given constraints, the only solution is when point C coincides with B, which is invalid. This indicates either the problem is flawed, or there's a misinterpretation of the angle measures.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not inscribed angles? Or maybe the angles are not all in the same circle? Or perhaps there are two circles involved? Or maybe the points are not all on the same circle?

Wait, the problem starts with "Circle(A)", so perhaps all points are on circle A. So AB is the diameter of circle A, points C and D are on circle A. 

But then, as shown, the constraints lead to a contradiction. Hence, there must be an alternative interpretation. Perhaps the angles are not all in the same circle? Or maybe the diagram includes other elements?

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not inscribed angles but something else. For example, angle ADC could be an external angle. Or perhaps there are triangles involved with different configurations.

Wait, let me try to consider triangle ADC. Angle at D is angle ADC, which we've said is ½ arc AC. If arc AC is β, then angle ADC = β/2. Similarly, angle ABD = β/2. And angle ACB = 90°. 

But if angle ADC = angle ABD = angle ACB, then β/2 = 90° → β = 180°, leading to arc AC = 180°, so C is at B. 

This seems unavoidable. Hence, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps the intended answer is that the sum of the angles is 180°, or something similar. 

Wait, the problem asks for the sum of angles: angle ADC, angle ACB, and angle BCD. Let's compute this sum.

Earlier, we had angle ADC = β/2, angle ACB = 90°, angle BCD = 90° - β/2. So sum is β/2 + 90° + (90° - β/2) = 180°. So the sum is 180°. Hence, x is 180°, but none of the answer choices are 180°. The options are 30, 35, 45, 85. Hence, this suggests that perhaps the question is asking for one of the individual angles, not the sum. 

But the problem says "SumOfAngles(A, Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(B,C,D))". Wait, maybe there are four angles? Let me recheck: "SumOfAngles(A, Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(B,C,D))". So it's the sum of three angles: angle ADC, angle ACB, and angle BCD. As computed above, this sum is 180°, but since none of the options match, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for angle BCD. Angle BCD is an inscribed angle subtending arc BD. Arc BD is arc from B to D. Since arc AD = β, and arc AB = 180°, arc BD = arc AB - arc AD = 180° - β. Hence, angle BCD = ½ * arc BD = ½(180° - β) = 90° - β/2.

Then, the sum is angle ADC (β/2) + angle ACB (90°) + angle BCD (90° - β/2) = β/2 + 90° + 90° - β/2 = 180°. So the sum is 180°, which is a constant, independent of β. Hence, the sum is always 180°, but the answer choices don't include 180°. 

However, the problem says "Find x." Perhaps x is one of the angles in the sum? For example, if the sum is 180°, and one of the angles is x, but we need to find x. But without additional info, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for one of the angles, like angle BCD, which is 90° - β/2. But how to find β?

From earlier, we have angle ADC = β/2 = angle ACB = 90°, so β = 180°, leading to angle BCD = 90° - 180°/2 = 90° - 90° = 0°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests a contradiction again. 

Perhaps there's an error in the problem's setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. 

What if AB is not the diameter, but a chord? But the problem says "IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B)" so AB is the diameter. 

Wait, maybe the circle is not the one with diameter AB, but another circle? Like, Circle(A) is a different circle? This is too ambiguous. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not all in the same circle. For example, angle ABD is in one circle, angle ADC in another. But this is speculative. 

Given the time I've spent and the recurring contradiction, perhaps I should consider that the intended answer is 45°, option C, as a common angle in such problems, and the contradiction might be due to a misread. 

Alternatively, let me try to think of a specific case where the angles are equal. Suppose angle ACB is 45°, but that would require AB not being the diameter. But if AB is the diameter, it must be 90°. Hence, no. 

Wait, if angle ACB is 90°, and angle ADC = angle ABD = 90°, which is impossible, but if we ignore that and assume that the sum of the three angles is 180°, and the answer choices are close to 45°, perhaps the intended answer is C. 45°.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves supplementary angles. For example, if angle ADC = angle ABD = x, and angle ACB = x, and the sum of the three angles is x + x + x = 3x = 180°, so x = 60°. But 60° is not among the options. 

Alternatively, if the sum is 180°, and one of the angles is x, but without knowing which, it's hard. 

Given the lack of clarity and the fact that the sum is 180°, and the options are 30, 35, 45, 85, perhaps the intended answer is 45°, assuming that x is one of the angles in the sum. For example, if angle BCD is 45°, then x=45°, option C. 

Alternatively, if angle ADC is 45°, then x=45°. 

But without knowing which angle x refers to, it's difficult. However, given the answer choices and common angles, 45° is plausible. Hence, I'll choose option C.
