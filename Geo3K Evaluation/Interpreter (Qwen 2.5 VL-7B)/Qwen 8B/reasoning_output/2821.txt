====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus. So first, I need to recall the properties of a rhombus. From what I remember, a rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all four sides are of equal length. That means every side should be congruent. Also, opposite angles are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But maybe I don't need all that here.

The question gives me expressions for AB and BC. Let me write them down. AB is 2x + 3, and BC is x + 7. Since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So AB should equal BC, right? Because all sides in a rhombus are equal. Wait, but hold on. In a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal. Wait no, actually, all sides are equal. So AB equals BC equals CD equals DA. Therefore, AB = BC. So setting those two expressions equal to each other would help me find the value of x.

So, let's set up the equation:

AB = BC  
2x + 3 = x + 7

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

x + 3 = 7

Then subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 7 - 3  
x = 4

Wait, so x is 4. Now, they want me to find CD. But since it's a rhombus, CD should be equal to BC, which is equal to AB, etc. So once we know x, we can plug it into either expression to find the length of each side.

Let me check. Let's compute BC first. BC is x + 7. Plugging x=4:

BC = 4 + 7 = 11. So BC is 11. Then CD should also be 11 because all sides are equal. So CD is 11. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 11. So the answer should be B?

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a trick here. Sometimes problems might have different configurations. For example, could there be a case where the sides aren't all equal? No, because the definition of a rhombus requires all sides to be equal. So if AB and BC are given as two adjacent sides, then they must be equal. Hence solving for x gives us x=4, leading to BC being 11, so CD is also 11. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem states that ABCD is a rhombus. Then AB = 2x + 3 and BC = x + 7. Find CD. Since in a rhombus, consecutive sides are equal. So AB = BC = CD = DA. Therefore, yes, CD is equal to BC, which is x+7. Once we find x, substitute back. So yes, that seems straightforward.

Another way to think: Maybe the problem is using some other property? Like maybe diagonals or something else? But the problem only mentions the lengths of AB and BC, so unless there's more information, I don't think so. The key thing is that all sides are equal in a rhombus. Therefore, equating AB and BC gives x=4, leading to BC (and hence CD) being 11. 

Therefore, the answer should be B. 11. Let me check the answer choices again. Yes, option B is 11. So Final Answer: B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ CD $ in the rhombus $ ABCD $, we begin by analyzing the fundamental geometric properties of a **rhombus**. One defining characteristic of a rhombus is that **all four sides are of equal length**. This implies:

$$
AB = BC = CD = DA
$$

---

### Step 1: Set Up the Equation Based on Side Lengths

We are given the expressions for two adjacent sides:

- $ AB = 2x + 3 $
- $ BC = x + 7 $

Since $ AB $ and $ BC $ are adjacent sides of a rhombus, they must be equal:

$$
2x + 3 = x + 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
2x + 3 = x + 7 \\
2x - x = 7 - 3 \\
x = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Side Length

Now that we know $ x = 4 $, we substitute this back into the expression for $ BC $ (or equivalently $ AB $):

$$
BC = x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
$$

Because all sides of a rhombus are equal, this tells us:

$$
CD = BC = 11
$$

---

### Conclusion

Thus, the length of $ CD $ is $ \boxed{11} $. Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct selection is:

$$
\text{Final Answer: B}
$$
