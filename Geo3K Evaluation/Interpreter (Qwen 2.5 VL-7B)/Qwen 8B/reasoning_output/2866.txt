====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the measure of angle 13, given that angle 3 is 110 degrees and angle 12 is 55 degrees. Hmm, first thing I should do is visualize the figure. Since there are angles labeled 3, 12, and 13, it might be a diagram with multiple lines intersecting, maybe a transversal with parallel lines? Or perhaps triangles involved?

Wait, without seeing the actual figure, I have to make some assumptions based on common geometric problems. Let me think. In many cases, when angles are labeled like this, they could be part of a triangle, or maybe a transversal cutting through two parallel lines. Also, sometimes these numbers refer to specific positions in a diagram with several intersecting lines.

Let me recall that when dealing with angles formed by a transversal and parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Also, vertical angles are equal. Maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are related through some of these relationships?

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involved, the sum of angles would be 180 degrees. But how does angle 13 fit into this?

Wait, another possibility: maybe angles 3, 12, and 13 are part of a triangle or a quadrilateral? For example, if angle 3 and angle 12 are adjacent angles forming a linear pair or something else.

But since angle 3 is 110°, which is obtuse, and angle 12 is 55°, which is acute. If they were supplementary, their sum would be 165°, which isn't 180°, so maybe not. Wait, but maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are parts of different structures.

Another thought: maybe angles 3 and 12 are vertical angles or something. But vertical angles are equal, so if angle 3 was 110, then its vertical angle would also be 110, but angle 12 is 55, so that can't be.

Alternatively, angle 3 and angle 12 could be supplementary. Let me check: 110 + 55 = 165, which isn't 180. So no. Hmm.

Wait, maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are part of a triangle? Let me suppose that. Suppose angle 3 is one angle of a triangle, and angle 12 is another. Then the third angle would be 180 - (110 + 55) = 15°, but that seems too small. Not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is an exterior angle for a triangle. The exterior angle theorem says that the measure of an exterior angle equals the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. But if angle 13 is an exterior angle, then maybe it's equal to angle 3 plus angle 12? Let me check: 110 + 55 = 165. But none of the answer choices is 165. However, that's way higher than the options given. So that might not be it.

Wait, maybe angle 13 is a remote interior angle? Wait, no. If angle 13 is an exterior angle, then it's equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. But unless we know which angles those are... Maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are the ones inside the triangle, and angle 13 is outside? That would mean angle 13 is 110 + 55 = 165, which again isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is vertical to angle 12? If angle 12 is 55°, then angle 13 would also be 55°, making answer A. But why would they label them as such? Unless they're vertical angles. But without knowing the exact diagram, it's hard to tell.

Wait, maybe there's a transversal crossing two parallel lines. Let me consider that. Suppose line l and line m are parallel, and a transversal crosses them. Let me assign labels. Let's say angle 3 is one of the angles formed, and angle 12 is another. Maybe they are same-side interior angles? If that's the case, they would be supplementary. But 110 + 55 = 165 ≠ 180. So that can't be.

Alternatively, angle 3 and angle 12 could be alternate interior angles? If they are, then they'd be congruent. But 110 ≠ 55, so that's not possible.

What about corresponding angles? Same thing, they should be equal. Again, 110 vs 55 don't match.

So maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are not directly related via standard transversal relationships. Maybe they are part of different intersections.

Wait, another idea: maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are angles in a polygon, like a pentagon or hexagon. But without more information, that's too vague.

Alternatively, think about triangle angle bisectors or something. Wait, maybe angle 13 is an angle in a triangle where two other angles are known? But again, without knowing which angles, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps there's a diagram with three lines intersecting at a point, creating various angles. For instance, if three lines meet at a single point, creating several angles around that point. The sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. But angle 3 is 110°, angle 12 is 55°, and angle 13 is unknown. If they are adjacent angles around that point, then maybe 110 + 55 + x = 360? Wait, but that would give x= 360 - 165 = 195, which is way too big. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 and angle 12 are vertical angles with angle 13. But again, not enough info.

Wait, maybe angle 13 is part of a triangle where angle 3 is an exterior angle. Let me try that. If angle 3 is an exterior angle, then it's equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. Suppose angle 3 is 110°, and if angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles, then the other remote interior angle would be 110 - 55 = 55°, but that would make angle 13 equal to that. But then angle 13 would be 55°, which is option A. But wait, how do I know angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles?

Alternatively, if angle 12 is the exterior angle, then angle 12 would equal the sum of the two remote interior angles. But angle 12 is 55°, so the sum of the remote interior angles would be 55°. But angle 3 is 110°, which would be larger than that. So that can't be.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the diagram involves a triangle with an extended side, forming an exterior angle. Let me imagine a triangle ABC, with a point D extending one of the sides. Suppose angle at vertex B is angle 3, which is 110°, and angle at vertex C is angle 12, which is 55°, then the exterior angle at A would be 110 + 55 = 165°, but again, that's not an option. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe angle 13 is a vertical angle to angle 12? If so, then angle 13 would be 55°, which is option A. But I'm just guessing. Without seeing the diagram, it's really hard to be certain. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is supplementary to angle 12? Then 180 - 55 = 125, which isn't an option either. 

Wait, another approach: look at the answer choices. The given angles are 110 and 55. The answer choices are 55, 65, 70, 110. So maybe angle 13 is complementary to angle 12? 90 - 55 = 35, not there. Or supplementary? 180 - 55 = 125. No. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle angle sum. If angle 3 is 110°, which is an exterior angle, then the two remote interior angles would add up to 110. If angle 12 is one of them, then the other would be 110 - 55 = 55. So that would be angle 13? If angle 13 is that other remote interior angle, then it would be 55°, which is option A. But I need to confirm if angle 13 is indeed that other remote interior angle. 

But how do I know which angles are which? It depends on the diagram. If angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles, then yes, angle 13 would be the other remote interior angle. But without seeing the diagram, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is a vertical angle with angle 3. Then it would be 110°, which is option D. But again, without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell. 

Given that angle 12 is 55°, and angle 3 is 110°, maybe angle 13 is related through a triangle or straight line. For instance, if angle 12 and angle 13 form a linear pair, then angle 13 would be 180 - 55 = 125°, which isn't an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 13 and angle 3 are vertical angles, then angle 13 is 110°, option D. 

But why would angle 13 be vertical to angle 3? If they are across from each other at an intersection, yes. But again, without the diagram, it's ambiguous. 

However, considering that angle 3 is 110°, which is quite large, and angle 12 is 55°, which is half of that. If angle 13 is an angle that forms a triangle with these, maybe. For example, if angle 3 and angle 12 are two angles of a triangle, then the third angle would be 180 - 110 - 55 = 15°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe angle 13 is an exterior angle to a triangle where angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles. Let's say angle 13 is an exterior angle, so it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. If angle 12 is one of them, and angle 3 is the other, then angle 13 = 110 + 55 = 165°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 13 is the exterior angle, and angle 12 is the other remote interior angle, then angle 3 would be the other remote interior angle. Wait, then angle 13 = angle 3 + angle 12 = 110 + 55 = 165°, still no good.

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is a supplement to angle 3. So 180 - 110 = 70°, which is option C. That seems plausible. If angle 13 and angle 3 are supplementary, then angle 13 would be 70°. How would that happen? If they are adjacent angles forming a straight line, like a linear pair. 

For example, if angle 3 and angle 13 are adjacent and together form a straight line, then they would add up to 180°. Therefore, angle 13 would be 180 - 110 = 70°, which is option C. 

But why would angle 3 and angle 13 be supplementary? That would depend on their placement in the diagram. If they are on a straight line, then yes. 

Alternatively, angle 12 could be part of a relationship with angle 13. For example, if angle 12 and angle 13 are vertical angles, then angle 13 is 55°, option A. 

But how to decide between options A, C, or D? 

Since angle 12 is 55°, and angle 3 is 110°, which is twice 55°. Maybe there's some proportional relationship. 

Wait, another thought: if angle 3 is 110°, which is an obtuse angle, and angle 12 is 55°, which is acute. If these are angles in a triangle, but that didn't work earlier. 

Wait, perhaps angle 13 is part of a triangle where angle 3 and angle 12 are angles in that triangle. Wait, but angle 3 is already 110°, which would make the triangle impossible because the sum of angles would exceed 180. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is part of a different triangle. 

I think I need to go back to basics. Given that there are multiple angles labeled, and without seeing the diagram, I need to rely on common configurations. 

One common configuration is having two parallel lines cut by a transversal, with several angles marked. In such cases, alternate interior angles are equal, corresponding angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. 

Suppose angle 3 and angle 12 are consecutive interior angles, meaning they are on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines. Then they would be supplementary. But angle 3 is 110° and angle 12 is 55°, adding to 165°, not 180°, so that's not possible. 

If angle 3 and angle 12 are alternate interior angles, they should be equal, but 110 ≠ 55, so no. 

If angle 3 and angle 12 are corresponding angles, same issue. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is a corresponding angle to angle 13, making them equal. So angle 13 would be 110°, option D. But then angle 12 being 55° would relate to another angle. 

Alternatively, angle 12 is a corresponding angle to angle 13, making them equal. So angle 13 is 55°, option A. 

But without knowing the exact position of these angles, it's tricky. However, since angle 3 is given as 110°, which is a larger angle, and angle 12 is 55°, which is smaller, maybe angle 13 is supplementary to angle 3, giving 70°, option C. 

Alternatively, if angle 13 is part of a triangle where angle 3 is an exterior angle. For example, if angle 3 is an exterior angle to a triangle, then it's equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. If angle 12 is one of those remote interior angles, then the other remote interior angle would be angle 13. So:

Exterior angle (angle 3) = sum of remote interior angles (angle 12 + angle 13)

So:

110 = 55 + angle 13 → angle 13 = 110 - 55 = 55° → option A.

That makes sense! So if angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles, then angle 13 would be the other remote interior angle, which is 55°. Hence, answer A.

But wait, why would angle 12 be a remote interior angle and angle 13 be the other? Depending on how the diagram is set up. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is the exterior angle, and angle 3 is one of the remote interior angles. Then:

Exterior angle (angle 13) = angle 3 + angle 12 → angle 13 = 110 + 55 = 165°, which isn't an option. 

But that gives us an invalid answer. So the only valid scenario here is if angle 3 is the exterior angle, and angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles, leading to angle 13 being the other remote interior angle, which would be 55°. Thus, answer A.

But then why is angle 13 considered a remote interior angle? That would depend on the diagram. For example, if you have triangle ABC, with an extension of side AB beyond B to a point D, making angle ABD an exterior angle. Then the exterior angle at D would be equal to the sum of angles at A and C. If angle 3 is the exterior angle (at D), and angle 12 is angle A, then angle C would be angle 13. So angle 13 would be angle C = 110 - 55 = 55°, hence answer A.

Therefore, this reasoning leads to answer A.

But I need to check other possibilities. Another way: if angle 3 and angle 12 are vertical angles, then angle 13 would be equal to angle 12, which is 55°, answer A. Or if angle 13 is vertical to angle 3, then it's 110°, answer D.

But which is more likely? In most diagrams, when labeling angles with numbers like 1-13, it's often in a complex figure with multiple intersections. If angle 3 and angle 12 are vertical angles, then they would be across from each other, but since they are different measures, that's not possible. So angle 3 and angle 12 cannot be vertical angles.

Thus, the exterior angle scenario is more plausible. Hence, angle 13 is 55°, option A. 

But wait, another possibility: if angle 13 is a vertical angle to angle 12, then angle 13 is 55°, option A. So that's another path to the same answer.

So regardless of whether angle 13 is a remote interior angle or vertical to angle 12, both lead to answer A. But why would angle 13 be vertical to angle 12? If they are formed by two intersecting lines, then yes. For example, if two lines cross, creating vertical angles. So if angle 12 and angle 13 are vertical, then they are equal.

But how can I determine which scenario applies? Well, since angle 3 is given as 110°, which is much larger than angle 12 (55°), it's possible that angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 12 is one of the remote interior angles, making angle 13 the other remote interior angle. This seems logical.

Alternatively, angle 13 could be vertical to angle 12. Both scenarios seem possible. However, in many standardized problems, when given an exterior angle and one of the remote interior angles, the other remote interior angle is often the desired answer. So angle 13 would be 55°, making answer A.

But wait, let me verify once more. Suppose angle 3 is an exterior angle, which equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. If angle 12 is one of them, then the other remote interior angle is angle 13. So angle 13 = exterior angle - angle 12 = 110 - 55 = 55°. Yes, that works.

Hence, answer A.

But another user might think that angle 13 is supplementary to angle 3, giving 70°, option C. How can I decide?

Well, if angle 3 and angle 13 are supplementary, like forming a linear pair, then 180 - 110 = 70°, option C. But why would they be supplementary? If they are adjacent and form a straight line.

But in that case, angle 12 is given as 55°, which would have to relate to other parts. But without knowing the diagram, both possibilities exist. Which is more likely?

In typical problems, when angles are labeled sequentially, like 3, 12, 13, it's often in a context where they are part of a triangle or transversal. If angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 12 is a remote interior angle, then angle 13 would be the other remote interior angle. 

But if angle 12 and angle 13 are vertical angles, then angle 13 is 55°. 

Alternatively, if angle 13 is an angle in a triangle where angle 3 and angle 12 are other angles. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if angle 12 and angle 13 are adjacent angles forming a straight line with angle 3. For example, angle 3 and angle 12 are adjacent, adding to angle 13. Wait, no.

This is very ambiguous. But given that angle 3 is 110°, which is a large angle, and angle 12 is 55°, which is half of that, maybe there's a relationship where angle 13 is the complement or supplement of angle 12. 

Wait, 55° is half of 110°, so maybe angle 13 is 55°, making answer A. 

But I need to pick one. Considering that angle 3 is an exterior angle and angle 12 is a remote interior angle, leading to angle 13 being 55°, I'll go with answer A. 

But I've seen similar problems where the answer is 70°, assuming that angle 13 is supplementary to angle 3. Let me think: if angle 3 is 110°, and angle 13 is supplementary to it, then angle 13 is 70°, option C. 

How could that happen? For instance, if angle 3 and angle 13 are on a straight line, forming a linear pair. So, angle 3 + angle 13 = 180°. So angle 13 = 180 - 110 = 70°. 

But then where does angle 12 come into play? Angle 12 is 55°, which might be part of another relationship. For example, if angle 12 is vertical to another angle, or part of a triangle. 

But if angle 13 is 70°, then angle 12 and angle 13 could be angles in a triangle with angle 3. Wait, if angle 3 is 110°, and angle 13 is 70°, then angle 12 would be 180 - 110 - 70 = 0°, which is impossible. So that doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if angle 12 and angle 13 are part of a triangle with angle 3. But angle 3 is already 110°, which is obtuse, so the other two angles would have to add up to 70°, and if angle 12 is 55°, then angle 13 would be 70 - 55 = 15°, which isn't an option. 

So that doesn't fit either. 

Back to the exterior angle idea: angle 3 is 110°, angle 12 is 55°, and angle 13 is the other remote interior angle. That gives angle 13 as 55°, option A. 

But how can I be sure? Well, if angle 13 is the other remote interior angle, then angle 12 and angle 13 are the two remote interior angles, and angle 3 is the exterior angle. So angle 3 = angle 12 + angle 13 → 110 = 55 + angle 13 → angle 13 = 55°. 

Yes, that fits perfectly. 

Therefore, the measure of angle 13 is 55°, so answer A.

**Final Answer**
Final Answer: A

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of ∠13, we begin by analyzing the given values and applying principles of geometry—specifically focusing on **exterior angle relationships** in triangles.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

We are told:

- $ m\angle 3 = 110^\circ $
- $ m\angle 12 = 55^\circ $

And we are asked to find the measure of $ \angle 13 $. Importantly, no diagram is provided, so we must rely on general geometric relationships that commonly appear in such problems.

---

### Step 2: Consider Geometric Relationships

The key insight lies in recognizing that **∠3** may represent an **exterior angle** of a triangle. In such a scenario, the **exterior angle** of a triangle is **equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent (remote) interior angles**.

Assume:

- $ \angle 3 $ is the **exterior angle**, formed by extending one side of a triangle.
- $ \angle 12 $ and $ \angle 13 $ are the **two remote interior angles** of the triangle.

According to the **Exterior Angle Theorem**:

$$
m\angle 3 = m\angle 12 + m\angle 13
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
110^\circ = 55^\circ + m\angle 13
$$

Now solve for $ m\angle 13 $:

$$
m\angle 13 = 110^\circ - 55^\circ = 55^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

From the above calculation, the measure of $ \angle 13 $ is **55 degrees**.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
