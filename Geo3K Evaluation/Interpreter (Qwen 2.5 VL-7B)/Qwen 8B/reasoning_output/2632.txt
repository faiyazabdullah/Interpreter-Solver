MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF. BG is a median of triangle ABC, and EH is a median of triangle DEF. We need to find the length of EH given BC = 30, BG = 15, and EF = 15. The answer choices are A. 7.5, B. 15, C. 22.5, D. 30.

First, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Let me recall that similarity implies that the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Also, medians in similar triangles should be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides.

Let me note down the given information:

- Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF (similar).
- BG is a median of ABC. So, BG connects vertex B to the midpoint of AC. Wait, no. Wait, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, BG is a median. Therefore, point G must be the midpoint of AC? Wait, but the line BG is drawn here. Wait, in the given lines, Line(B,G) is present. So, BG is a median, so it connects B to the midpoint of AC. Similarly, EH is a median of DEF, connecting E to the midpoint of DF?

Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention that EF = 15. Since EF is a side of triangle DEF. Let me think about the correspondence between the triangles. Since ABC ~ DEF, we need to know which angles correspond. Typically, the order matters. So, if ABC ~ DEF, then angle A corresponds to D, B to E, C to F. So, AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, and AC to DF.

So, BC corresponds to EF. Given that BC = 30 and EF = 15. That would mean the ratio of similarity is EF / BC = 15 / 30 = 1/2. Therefore, the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. So, each side of DEF is half the corresponding side of ABC.

But wait, BG is a median of ABC, and EH is a median of DEF. Since medians are related to the sides. In triangle ABC, BG is a median. Let me recall that in a triangle, the length of a median can be related to the lengths of the sides. But maybe there's a simpler way here because of similarity.

Since the triangles are similar, their medians should also be in the same ratio as their sides. So, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF would be EH. Because the correspondence is ABC ~ DEF, so the median from B in ABC corresponds to the median from E in DEF. Wait, because in triangle ABC, the median from B goes to AC; in triangle DEF, the median from E would go to DF. 

Therefore, the length of BG in ABC corresponds to the length of EH in DEF. Since the scale factor is 1/2, then EH = BG * scale factor. Wait, but hold on: if ABC is larger than DEF, then the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. So, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF would be EH = BG * (scale factor). Wait, but which direction is the scaling?

Let me clarify. If ABC ~ DEF with ratio k, meaning that each side of DEF is k times the corresponding side of ABC. Here, BC corresponds to EF. BC = 30, EF = 15, so EF = (1/2)*BC. Therefore, the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. Therefore, every length in DEF is half the corresponding length in ABC. Therefore, the median EH in DEF corresponds to the median BG in ABC. Therefore, EH = BG * (scale factor). Wait, but BG is in ABC, and EH is in DEF. So, if the scale factor is 1/2, then EH = BG * (1/2)? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, since the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF is 1/2, then the ratio of corresponding medians is also 1/2. Therefore, EH = BG * 1/2. Given BG is 15, then EH would be 15*(1/2)=7.5. Which would be option A.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose that triangle ABC has a median BG, and triangle DEF has a median EH. Since ABC ~ DEF, the ratio of similarity is 1/2. Then, the ratio of BG to EH should be equal to the ratio of similarity. So, BG/EH = ratio of ABC to DEF. Since DEF is smaller, the ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1. Therefore, BG/EH = 2/1 => EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So that would make EH = 7.5, which is option A.

But let me verify this another way. Maybe using coordinates or formula for medians.

Alternatively, the formula for the length of a median in terms of the sides. For example, in triangle ABC, the median from B to AC. Let me recall that the length of a median can be calculated using the formula:

m_b^2 = (2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)/4

Where m_b is the median from vertex B to side AC, and a, c are the lengths of the sides adjacent to B, i.e., AB and BC, while b is the length of AC.

Wait, but perhaps I don't need to get into that. Since the triangles are similar, their medians are in proportion to their corresponding sides. So, if the ratio of similarity is 1/2, then all corresponding medians have the same ratio. Hence, BG in ABC corresponds to EH in DEF, so EH = BG * (ratio). Wait, but which ratio?

If ABC ~ DEF with ratio k, then each side of DEF is k times the corresponding side of ABC. So, suppose that the ratio of ABC to DEF is k, meaning that DEF = k*ABC. So, if BC corresponds to EF, then EF = k*BC. Given BC=30, EF=15, so k=EF/BC=15/30=1/2. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 1/2. Thus, each side of DEF is half of the corresponding side in ABC. Therefore, the median EH in DEF corresponds to the median BG in ABC. Therefore, EH = BG * k = 15 * (1/2) = 7.5. So answer is A.

But let me think again. Another approach: since BG is a median of ABC, and EF is a side of DEF. Let me try to relate BG to BC. Wait, BC is a side of ABC, and EF is a corresponding side in DEF. Since BG is a median, not necessarily related directly to BC. However, since the triangles are similar, the medians would be proportional.

Alternatively, since BG is a median in ABC, then the length of BG depends on the sides of ABC. Let me consider that in triangle ABC, BG is a median. Let me assume that ABC is similar to DEF, so their medians are proportional.

But without knowing more about the sides of ABC, how can I relate BG to BC? Wait, but if we can express BG in terms of BC and other sides?

Alternatively, since the problem gives BC = 30, BG = 15, and asks for EH given EF = 15. Since EF is corresponding to BC, which is 30, so the ratio is 1/2. So, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF would be EH, which would be BG multiplied by the ratio of similarity. So, 15 * 1/2 = 7.5. So answer is A. 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check with an example. Let's say triangle ABC has BC = 30, and BG is a median. Let me imagine ABC being such that BC is the base. The median BG would split AC into two equal parts. But unless ABC is isoceles or something, the length of BG isn't directly determined by BC alone. However, since the triangles are similar, and the ratio is known, perhaps the ratio of medians is same as ratio of sides. So even though BG is not directly dependent on BC, since the entire triangle is scaled, the median would scale accordingly. 

For instance, if you have two similar triangles, with scale factor k, then all corresponding linear measurements (sides, medians, heights, etc.) are scaled by k. Therefore, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF is EH, and EH = BG * k. Since k is 1/2, then EH = 15 * 1/2 = 7.5. Therefore, answer A.

Another thought: Is there a possibility that BG corresponds to a different median in DEF? Like, maybe the median from E corresponds to the median from B? Let me check the correspondence.

Given that ABC ~ DEF. So, vertices A→D, B→E, C→F. So, the median from B in ABC corresponds to the median from E in DEF. Therefore, BG is the median from B to AC in ABC. The corresponding median in DEF would be from E to DF. Therefore, EH is the median from E to DF. Therefore, yes, EH is the corresponding median. Therefore, their lengths are in the ratio of similarity. Therefore, EH = BG * (EF / BC) = 15 * (15/30) = 15*(1/2)=7.5. So answer A.

But let me confirm once more. Suppose that in triangle ABC, BG is a median. Then, in triangle DEF, EH is the corresponding median. Since the ratio of similarity is 1/2, then EH = BG * 1/2. So, 15 * 1/2 = 7.5. Hence, answer A.

But wait, could there be confusion about which sides correspond? For example, maybe BC corresponds to EF, so BC is a side of ABC, and EF is a side of DEF. So, BC corresponds to EF. Therefore, the ratio is EF / BC = 1/2, so the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. Therefore, all corresponding lengths in DEF are half those in ABC. Therefore, the median EH in DEF is half the corresponding median in ABC. Since BG is the corresponding median in ABC, EH = BG * 1/2 = 15 * 1/2 = 7.5. So answer A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. 7.5. Which is option A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ EH $, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the two triangles $ \triangle ABC $ and $ \triangle DEF $, which are stated to be **similar** ($\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$).

---

### Step 1: Understand the Similarity Ratio

We are given:
- Side $ BC = 30 $
- Corresponding side $ EF = 15 $

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. This gives us the **similarity ratio**:

$$
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Length of } EF}{\text{Length of } BC} = \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

This means that **every length in triangle $ \triangle DEF $ is half the corresponding length in triangle $ \triangle ABC $**.

---

### Step 2: Medians in Similar Triangles

The key property of similar triangles is that **corresponding medians are also in the same ratio as the similarity ratio**.

- $ BG $ is a **median** of $ \triangle ABC $
- $ EH $ is a **median** of $ \triangle DEF $

These are **corresponding medians**, so their lengths are also in the same ratio as the similarity ratio. Thus,

$$
EH = BG \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

Substitute the given value of $ BG = 15 $:

$$
EH = 15 \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
$$

\boxed{A}
