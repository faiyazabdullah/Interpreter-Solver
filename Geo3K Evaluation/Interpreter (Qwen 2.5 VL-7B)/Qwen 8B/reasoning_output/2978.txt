MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P. Points M, N, and L are on the circle since lines PM, PN, PL are drawn from P, which is the center. Wait, but in a circle, the radius would be from the center to any point on the circumference. So, points M, N, L are all on the circumference of circle P. 

The problem says that angle MPL is 65 degrees. Let me visualize this. Point P is the center. Lines PM, PN, PL are radii. So triangle MPl is formed by connecting these three radii? Wait, no. Wait, angle at P between points M and L? Wait, angle MPL means the vertex is at P, with segments PM and PL. So, angle at P between M and L. But since PM and PL are both radii, then angle MPl is the central angle corresponding to arc ML. Wait, but the measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if angle MPL is 65 degrees, then arc ML should be 65 degrees. But wait, the question asks for the measure of arc NM. Hmm.

Wait, there's also another condition: NP is perpendicular to PL. So line NP is perpendicular to line PL. Since P is the center, NP is a radius, and PL is another radius. If NP is perpendicular to PL, then the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees. So angle NPL is 90 degrees. Therefore, in terms of arcs, the angle between two radii NP and PL corresponds to the arc NL. So, the measure of arc NL would be equal to the central angle NPL, which is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc NL is 90 degrees.

But how does this relate to arc NM? Let me think. The total circle is 360 degrees. Let me try to find the measure of arc NM. Maybe I need to figure out the positions of points M, N, L around the circle.

Let me draw a diagram mentally. Let me consider point P as the center. Let me imagine placing points N, M, L on the circumference. We know that angle NPL is 90 degrees (since NP ⊥ PL), so the arc from N to L is 90 degrees. Also, angle MPL is 65 degrees, meaning the arc from M to L is 65 degrees. Wait, but angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. 

Now, if arc NL is 90 degrees and arc ML is 65 degrees, maybe we can find arc NM by considering overlapping arcs?

Wait, perhaps the positions of the points are such that starting from N, going through some points to M and L. Let me think about the order of the points on the circle. Suppose the points are arranged in the order N, then something, then L, and M somewhere else. But without knowing the exact configuration, it might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angles at the center correspond to arcs.

Alternatively, since angle NPL is 90 degrees, which is arc NL. And angle MPL is 65 degrees, which is arc ML. Then, depending on the position of N relative to M, we can find arc NM. For example, suppose that moving from N to L is 90 degrees, and from M to L is 65 degrees. Depending on whether M is on one side or the other of N, arc NM could be different.

Wait, maybe we need to consider that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. Let me try to express the arcs in terms of known quantities.

If arc NL is 90 degrees, and arc ML is 65 degrees, then depending on the location of M relative to N and L, the arc NM could be arc NL minus arc ML, or arc ML plus arc NL, etc. Wait, let me think again.

Imagine that points N, M, L are placed such that when you go from N to L along the circle, it's 90 degrees. Then, from M to L is 65 degrees. So if M is between N and L, then arc NM would be arc NL minus arc ML, which is 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. That seems possible. Alternatively, if M is on the opposite side of L from N, then arc NM could be arc NL + arc LM, but that would depend on direction. However, since angle MPL is 65 degrees, which is the central angle between M and L, so the arc from M to L is 65 degrees regardless of direction. 

Assuming that the points are arranged such that N, then M, then L, but that may not hold. Wait, but if angle NPL is 90 degrees, then NP and PL are perpendicular. So, if I imagine PL pointing to the right, then NP would be pointing upwards or downwards. Let me assign coordinates for clarity. Let me assume P is at the origin. Let me take coordinate system where P is (0,0). Let me assume that point L is at (1,0) because it's a radius. Then, since NP is perpendicular to PL, which is along the x-axis, so NP would be vertical. If PL is horizontal, then NP is vertical. So, if NP is perpendicular to PL, then NP is vertical. Assuming that NP goes upward, then N would be at (0,1) since it's a radius. So, point N is (0,1), point L is (1,0), point P is (0,0).

Now, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So angle at P between points M and L. Let me see. So angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. Since PL is along the positive x-axis, PM makes an angle of 65 degrees with PL. So, if PL is along the x-axis, then PM is making 65 degrees above or below the x-axis. But since N is at (0,1), which is straight up, if PM is forming a 65-degree angle with PL (the x-axis), then point M could be located at an angle of 65 degrees from the x-axis. But we need to check if that conflicts with other conditions.

Wait, but point M is also on the circle. Let me think. Let me define coordinates. Let me assume unit circle for simplicity, radius 1. So coordinates:

- P is at (0,0)
- L is at (1,0)
- N is at (0,1) because NP is vertical (perpendicular to PL)
- Now, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. Since PL is along the x-axis from P(0,0) to L(1,0), then PM is a vector making 65 degrees with PL. So direction of PM is 65 degrees from x-axis. Therefore, coordinates of M would be (cos(65°), sin(65°)). 

Now, we need to find arc NM. Arc from N(0,1) to M(cos65°, sin65°). What's the measure of that arc? Since arc length corresponds to central angle between N and M.

So, the central angle between N and M is the difference in their angles from the x-axis. Point N is at 90 degrees (since it's (0,1)), and point M is at 65 degrees. Wait, but angles are measured from the positive x-axis. So, point N is at 90 degrees, and point M is at 65 degrees. So the central angle between N and M is 90° - 65° = 25°. Hence, arc NM measures 25 degrees. Therefore, the answer is A. 25.

Wait, but let me confirm. Because depending on the direction of the angle, if the angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees, but maybe PM is on the other side? Like, if instead of being above the x-axis, it's below? But since N is already at (0,1), if M were on the lower half, then the central angle between N and M would be larger than 90 degrees. However, the problem states that angle MPL is 65 degrees. Let me verify the angle.

If PM is at 65 degrees above the x-axis, then the angle between PM and PL (which is along x-axis) is indeed 65 degrees. If PM were at 65 degrees below the x-axis, then the angle between PM and PL would still be 65 degrees, but then the central angle between N (at 90 degrees) and M (at -65 degrees) would be 90 - (-65) = 155 degrees, which is more than 180. But since arcs can be considered as minor arcs unless specified otherwise. But the problem mentions arc NM, which is likely the minor arc. So if the central angle is 25 degrees, then that would be the minor arc. But if the central angle was 155, that would be major arc. But since angle MPL is given as 65 degrees, which is acute, probably implying that M is positioned such that the central angle is small. 

Therefore, assuming that M is in the upper half, making the central angle between N and M as 25 degrees, leading to arc NM being 25 degrees. Thus, answer A.

Another way: since angle NPL is 90 degrees (arc NL is 90 degrees), and angle MPL is 65 degrees (arc ML is 65 degrees). So, if we consider the entire circle, arc NL is 90 degrees, arc ML is 65 degrees. Depending on the arrangement, arc NM could be arc NL minus arc ML if they overlap. So 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. Hence, arc NM is 25 degrees. Which matches the previous calculation. Therefore, answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- **Circle with center $ P $**: All radii (segments from $ P $ to any point on the circle) are equal in length.
- **Points $ M $, $ N $, and $ L $** lie on the circumference of the circle.
- **$ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $**: This is a central angle subtended by arc $ ML $.
- **$ NP \perp PL $**: This implies that $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $, hence the arc $ NL $ measures $ 90^\circ $.

---

### Step 1: Understand Central Angles and Their Corresponding Arcs

- In a circle, the **measure of a central angle** equals the **measure of its intercepted arc**.
- Given:
  - $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $ → arc $ ML = 65^\circ $
  - $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $ (because $ NP \perp PL $) → arc $ NL = 90^\circ $

---

### Step 2: Determine the Position of Points

We want to determine the measure of **arc $ NM $**. To do this, consider the relationship among arcs:

- Arc $ NL = 90^\circ $
- Arc $ ML = 65^\circ $

These arcs share the endpoint $ L $. If we assume that the points are arranged in the order $ N \to M \to L $ along the circumference (a common interpretation in problems like this), then:

$$
\text{arc } NM = \text{arc } NL - \text{arc } ML = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ
$$

This gives us the measure of arc $ NM $ directly.
