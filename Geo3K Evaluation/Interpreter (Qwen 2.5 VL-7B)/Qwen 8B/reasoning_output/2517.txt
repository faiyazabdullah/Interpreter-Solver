====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have points A, B, C, D, F. The lines AB, BC, DB, BF are mentioned. Also, there are angles involved. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the description.

First, it says that BA and BC are opposite rays. Opposite rays mean they share the same endpoint and form a straight line. So, point B is between A and C? Wait, no—if BA and BC are opposite rays, then point B is the common endpoint, and A and C are in opposite directions from B. That would make AC a straight line passing through B, right? So, points A, B, C are colinear with B between A and C. Wait, but BA and BC being opposite rays implies that angle ABC is a straight angle, which is 180 degrees. But then there's another angle mentioned involving D and F. 

Then it says BD bisects angle ABF. So, angle ABF is being bisected by BD. Wait, but first I need to figure out where points D and F are located. Let me parse the given information again.

The problem states that vectors BA and BC are opposite rays. So BA and BC are opposite rays starting at B. Therefore, points A and C are on opposite sides of B, making a straight line through B. Then there's point D connected to B via line BD, and point F connected to B via BF. 

Also, angle ABF is mentioned. Since BA is a ray going from B through A, and BF is another ray from B. So F is some point such that BF forms an angle with BA. Additionally, BD bisects angle ABF. So BD splits angle ABF into two equal parts. 

Given that m∠FBC = 2x + 25 and m∠ABF = 10x - 1. We need to find m∠DBF.

Wait, let me confirm the notation. ∠FBC is the measure of angle at point B, between points F, B, C. Similarly, ∠ABF is the angle at B between A, B, F. And BD is the bisector of ∠ABF, so BD divides ∠ABF into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABD equals ∠DBF. 

But wait, since BA and BC are opposite rays, then points A, B, C are colinear with B between A and C. So, if you consider line AC passing through B. Now, BF is another ray from B. Let me sketch mentally:

- Point B is the vertex.
- BA goes one direction (say left), BC goes the opposite direction (right).
- BF is some other ray from B, forming an angle with BA.
- BD bisects angle ABF, so BD splits angle ABF into two equal parts.

Now, the measure of angle FBC is given as 2x + 25. Let me think about how angle FBC relates to other angles. Since BC is a straight line from B (opposite to BA), then angle FBC is adjacent to angle ABF? Or maybe part of it?

Let me think. Since BA and BC are opposite rays, the entire angle from BA to BC is 180 degrees. Now, BF is a ray from B somewhere. Depending on where F is, angle ABF could be less than 180 degrees. However, angle FBC is given. Let me see: if I imagine BF splitting the plane such that from BA to BF is angle ABF, and from BF to BC is angle FBC. Wait, but since BA and BC are opposite rays, the sum of angles ABF and FBC should be equal to 180 degrees. Because BA to BF is angle ABF, then BF to BC would complete the straight line. So, ABF + FBC = 180°. Is that correct?

Yes! Because BA and BC are opposite rays, so the total angle between BA and BC is 180°, so if BF is a ray between BA and BC, then angle ABF plus angle FBC equals 180°. Therefore:

m∠ABF + m∠FBC = 180°

Given that m∠ABF = 10x - 1 and m∠FBC = 2x + 25, so adding them gives:

(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180  
Combine like terms: 12x + 24 = 180  
Subtract 24: 12x = 156  
Divide by 12: x = 13

So x is 13. Then plug back into the expressions for the angles.

First, compute m∠ABF = 10x -1 = 10*13 -1 = 130 -1 = 129 degrees. 

Then m∠FBC = 2x +25 = 2*13 +25 = 26 +25 = 51 degrees. 

Check if these add up to 180: 129 + 51 = 180. Yes, that works.

Now, BD bisects angle ABF. So BD divides angle ABF into two equal parts. Therefore, each of those parts is half of angle ABF. So m∠ABD = m∠DBF = (1/2)*m∠ABF.

Therefore, m∠DBF = (1/2)*(10x -1). Since x=13, substitute:

(1/2)*(129) = 64.5 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 64.5. So that should be the answer. Let me check again to ensure I didn't make mistakes.

Wait, but let me verify once more. The key steps were:

1. Recognize that BA and BC are opposite rays, hence forming a straight line, leading to ABF + FBC = 180°.

2. Solve for x using the equation: 10x -1 + 2x +25 = 180 → 12x +24 = 180 → x=13.

3. Calculate angle ABF as 129°, then divide by 2 because BD bisects it, giving 64.5°, which is option D.

Yes, seems correct. So the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle DBF $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We're told:

- $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$ are **opposite rays**, meaning they originate from point $ B $ and extend in opposite directions. This makes the angle formed at $ B $ between rays $ \overrightarrow{BA} $ and $ \overrightarrow{BC} $ a **straight angle** of $ 180^\circ $.

- Ray $ \overrightarrow{BF} $ lies in the plane such that it creates an angle $ \angle ABF $ with $ \overrightarrow{BA} $. Also, ray $ \overrightarrow{BD} $ **bisects** $ \angle ABF $, implying it divides this angle into two equal parts.

- Given measures:
  - $ m\angle FBC = 2x + 25 $
  - $ m\angle ABF = 10x - 1 $

---

### **Step 2: Use Angle Relationships**

Since $ \angle ABF + \angle FBC = 180^\circ $ (as $ \angle ABC $ is a straight angle):

$$
(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180
$$

Simplify:

$$
12x + 24 = 180 \\
12x = 156 \\
x = 13
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Measure of $ \angle ABF $**

Using the value of $ x $:

$$
m\angle ABF = 10x - 1 = 10(13) - 1 = 129^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use the Angle Bisector Property**

Ray $ \overrightarrow{BD} $ bisects $ \angle ABF $, so:

$$
m\angle DBF = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m\angle ABF = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 129 = 64.5^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the measure of $ \angle DBF $ is:

$$
\boxed{64.5}
$$

This matches **Option D**.
