Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a circle with center O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F are mentioned. The lines OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF are all radii since they're connecting the center to points on the circle. Also, there are some right angles mentioned: Angle at AFO, FOE, EOD, and DOD? Wait, no, the original problem says RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O), which would be angle AFO? Or maybe it's angle AOF? Wait, need to parse that correctly.

Wait, the first line says: RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O). That should mean that angle at point F between points A, F, O is a right angle. Similarly for others. Then Equal measures for angles BOA, EOF, FOA, DOE, EOD... Wait, the exact wording is:

Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD)). Wait, but then Arc(A,D) is mentioned. The question asks for measure of arc AD.

But let me start again. Let me rephrase the problem.

Given circle O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines AB, CD, OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF. Right angles at angles AFO, FOE, EOD, DOD? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact constraints again.

Original problem says:

RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O) – so angle at F between A-F-O is a right angle.

Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(F,O,E): angle at O between F-O-E is a right angle?

Wait, angle notation can be confusing. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So Angle(A,F,O) is the angle at F between A-F-O. So that's angle AFO. And similarly, Angle(F,O,E) is angle at O between F-O-E, which is angle FOE.

So the given right angles are:

- ∠AFO is a right angle (90 degrees).

- ∠FOE is a right angle.

- ∠EOD is a right angle.

- ∠DOA? Wait, the next one was Line(O,D), etc. Wait, original problem lists:

RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O)

RightAngle(Angle(F,O,E)

RightAngle(Angle(E,O,D)

RightAngle(Angle(D,O,B)

Ah, okay. So four right angles:

∠AFO = 90°, ∠FOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°, ∠DOB = 90°? Wait, Angle(D,O,B) is angle at O between D-O-B, which is ∠DOB. So those four angles are right angles.

Additionally, there's an equal measure condition:

Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD)).

Wait, that seems conflicting because earlier we had right angles. Maybe there's a typo here? Wait, perhaps the Equal statements refer to angles whose measures are equal. Let me check again:

The problem states:

Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD))

Wait, but earlier, there were right angles. For example, ∠FOE is a right angle, so its measure is 90°. But the Equal statement says that the measure of ∠BOD equals the measure of ∠EOF equals measure of ∠FOA equals measure of ∠DOE equals measure of ∠EOD. Wait, but ∠FOE is already a right angle (from the right angle constraint). So if ∠EOF is equal to ∠FOA, etc., then these angles might also be 90°, but that may conflict with other constraints.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me go back.

The user wrote:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O)

RightAngle(Angle(F,O,E)

RightAngle(Angle(E,O,D)

RightAngle(Angle(D,O,B)"

So four right angles:

1. ∠AFO is a right angle.

2. ∠FOE is a right angle.

3. ∠EOD is a right angle.

4. ∠DOB is a right angle.

Then, the equal measures:

Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD))

Wait, but ∠FOE is already a right angle (from the right angle constraint), so the measure of ∠FOE is 90°, and according to the equality, ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD are all equal. Wait, but ∠EOF is same as ∠FOE? Because angle EOF is the same as angle FOE? Wait, angle EOF is at point O between E-O-F. So that's the same as angle FOE, which is the same as angle EOD? No, wait. Wait, the Equal statement includes MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD)). So five angles: ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD. But note that ∠EOF is same as ∠FOE? Or different?

Wait, ∠EOF is angle at O between E-O-F. Whereas ∠FOE is angle at O between F-O-E. They are the same angle. So ∠EOF is same as ∠FOE. So the Equal statement says that ∠BOD, ∠EOF (which is same as ∠FOE), ∠FOA, ∠DOE, and ∠EOD are all equal in measure.

But from the right angles, we know that ∠FOE is 90°, so each of those angles must be 90°. Therefore, ∠BOD, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD are all 90°. However, that might lead to contradictions unless certain conditions hold.

Wait, but maybe there's confusion here. Let me think again.

Let me sketch mentally the circle with center O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F. Given that EC and AB are diameters. Wait, the problem says "EC and AB are diameters". So EC is a diameter, meaning that E and C are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, AB is a diameter, so A and B are endpoints of another diameter.

Therefore, OA and OB are radii, so AB is a straight line passing through O, making AB a diameter. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so O is the midpoint of EC.

Now, considering the right angles:

First, ∠AFO is a right angle. Since A and F are points on the circle, and O is the center. So AF is a chord. If ∠AFO is 90°, then triangle AFO has a right angle at F. Similarly, ∠FOE is a right angle, so triangle FOE is right-angled at O. Wait, no: ∠FOE is the angle at O between F and E. Wait, no. Wait, ∠FOE is the angle at O between F and E? Wait, no. If the angle is written as ∠FOE, then vertex is O, with sides going to F and E. So that's the angle at O between points F and E. So that's ∠FOE, which is at O.

Similarly, ∠EOD is at O between E and D, so that's ∠EOD. And ∠DOB is at O between D and B, so ∠DOB.

So, given that, and that EC and AB are diameters. Let me try to place points.

Since AB is a diameter, then points A and B are opposite each other on the circle. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E and C are opposite each other.

Now, the equal measure angles: ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD are all equal. Wait, but ∠EOF is the same as ∠FOE, which is part of the right angles. From the right angles, ∠FOE is 90°, so ∠EOF is 90°, hence all those equal angles must be 90°, implying that each of ∠BOD, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD is 90°. But how does that fit into the diagram?

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the Equal statement is referring to angles that are congruent, not necessarily their measures being equal. But the problem says "Equal(MeasureOf(...)", so it's about measures.

Wait, but if ∠FOE is a right angle (from the right angle constraint), then its measure is 90°, and since it's equal to ∠BOD, ∠FOA, etc., then those angles must also be 90°. So ∠BOD = 90°, ∠FOA=90°, etc.

But let me think step by step.

Starting with AB as a diameter. So points A and B are on opposite ends of the circle. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E and C are opposite.

Now, the right angles:

1. ∠AFO is a right angle. So triangle AFO is right-angled at F. Since O is the center, OA is radius, OF is also radius (since F is on the circle). So OA = OF. Triangle AFO has OA and OF as legs, both equal length, and right angle at F. Therefore, triangle AFO is an isosceles right-angled triangle. Hence, angle at O (∠AO F) would be 45°, since the two legs are equal. Wait, but ∠AFO is the right angle. So in triangle AFO, angle at F is 90°, angle at A and angle at O?

Wait, in triangle AFO, vertices are A, F, O. The right angle is at F. So sides AF, FO, OA. Since OA and OF are radii, OA = OF. Therefore, triangle AFO is an isosceles right triangle with legs AF and FO, and hypotenuse AO. Wait, but OA is a radius, and FO is also a radius. Wait, but AF is a chord. Wait, but OA and OF are radii, so OA = OF. So triangle AFO has two sides OA and OF equal, with right angle at F. Therefore, OA^2 = AF^2 + OF^2. Since OA = OF, then OA^2 = AF^2 + OA^2 → AF^2 = 0 → AF = 0. Which is impossible. Wait, that suggests something wrong.

Wait, that can't be. There must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.

If triangle AFO has a right angle at F, then by Pythagoras:

AF² + FO² = AO².

But AO is the radius, and FO is also the radius. So AF² + r² = r² ⇒ AF² = 0 ⇒ AF = 0. Which implies that points A and F coincide, which isn't possible. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake here. How come?

This suggests that my interpretation of the angle is wrong. Maybe ∠AFO is not the angle at F, but at O? Wait, the notation Angle(A,F,O) means the angle at F between A-F-O. So yes, right angle at F. So that leads to contradiction. Therefore, my understanding must be incorrect.

Alternative possibility: Maybe the right angles are not inside the circle but outside? Or perhaps the points are arranged differently.

Wait, but all points are on the circle. So if F is on the circle, then OF is a radius. So OA and OF are both radii. Then, triangle AFO having a right angle at F would require AF to be zero. Which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption about the angles must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not all inside the circle? Or maybe the points are not all distinct? Or perhaps the arcs are involved?

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not in the triangle AFO, but in another configuration. Wait, maybe ∠AFO is not a triangle but involving other points. Let me check again.

The problem says:

RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O): This is angle AFO, which is formed by points A, F, O. If F is on the circle, and O is the center, then line OF is a radius. Point A is another point on the circle. So angle at F between A-F-O.

Wait, maybe this is not a triangle, but just an angle. Let me consider coordinates to visualize.

Let me assume coordinate system with O at origin. Suppose point A is at (1,0), and since AB is a diameter, point B is at (-1,0). Now, suppose point F is somewhere on the circle. Then, angle AFO is the angle at F between points A, F, O.

For that angle to be 90°, what must be true? Let me use coordinates. Let’s say F has coordinates (x,y), lying on the unit circle, so x² + y² = 1. Point A is (1,0), O is (0,0).

Vector FA is from F to A: (1 - x, 0 - y). Vector FO is from F to O: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). The angle between FA and FO at point F is 90°, so the vectors FA and FO should be perpendicular. Their dot product should be zero.

Dot product of FA and FO:

(1 - x)(-x) + (0 - y)(-y) = -x(1 - x) + y² = -x + x² + y².

Since x² + y² = 1, substitute:

-x + 1 = 0 → x = 1.

Thus, x = 1. So point F is at (1, y), but since x=1 and x² + y² =1, then y=0. So point F is (1,0), which is the same as point A. But that's impossible because F is a distinct point. Therefore, this suggests that the only way for angle AFO to be 90° is if F coincides with A, which is not allowed. Hence, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between FA and FO, but between AF and OF? Wait, no—angle at F, so it's between FA and FO.

Hmm, this seems problematic. What if the right angle is not between FA and FO, but between OF and something else? Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different notation.

Wait, maybe the angle is not at F, but at O? Like Angle(A,O,F)? But the problem says Angle(A,F,O), which is angle at F.

Alternatively, could there be a typo in the problem? Maybe it's supposed to be Angle(A,O,F) instead of Angle(A,F,O)? Let's assume that for a moment. If the angle is at O, then ∠AOF is a right angle. That makes more sense. Because if ∠AOF is 90°, then points A, O, F form a right angle, which would make sense if F is positioned such that OF is perpendicular to OA.

Assuming that, let me proceed. Maybe the original problem had a typo in the angle notation, placing the middle letter incorrectly. Assuming that, let me try again.

Suppose the right angles are:

1. ∠AOF is right angle (at O).

2. ∠FOE is right angle (at O).

3. ∠EOD is right angle (at O).

4. ∠DOB is right angle (at O).

That would make sense, as each of these angles at O would be 90°, dividing the circle into quarters. Then, the equal measure angles would refer to angles like ∠BOA, ∠EOF, etc., but I need to clarify.

But the original problem says "Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(BOD)...", which would be ∠BOD, which is at O. So if ∠BOD is equal to ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD, then all these angles are equal.

Assuming that, let's think again.

If ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB are each 90°, then the total around point O would be 90+90+90+90=360°, which works. But the problem mentions equal measures of several angles, including ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD. Wait, ∠EOF is same as ∠FOE? If the angles are at O, then ∠FOE is same as ∠EOF, which would be part of the 90° angles.

But then, if ∠BOD is equal to ∠EOF, which is 90°, then ∠BOD is also 90°, which fits. Similarly, ∠FOA would be 90°, etc. But then, what about arc AD?

Wait, the question asks for measure of arc AD. So arc from A to D along the circumference.

To find arc AD, we need to determine the central angle subtended by AD, which is ∠AOD.

So if we can find ∠AOD, then that will give us the measure of arc AD.

Now, let's try to reconstruct the positions of points based on the given information.

Assume AB and EC are diameters. Let's fix AB horizontally for simplicity: let O be at (0,0), A at (1,0), B at (-1,0). EC is another diameter; let's assume it's vertical for simplicity, with E at (0,1) and C at (0,-1). 

Now, the right angles at O: ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB are each 90°. Let's see:

Start from point A (1,0). The angle ∠AOF is 90°, so from OA to OF is 90°, meaning OF is perpendicular to OA. Since OA is along positive x-axis, OF would be along positive y-axis. So point F is at (0,1). But wait, that's point E. Hmm, but point E is already defined as part of diameter EC. So maybe F is at (0,1), which is point E? But then F=E? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe F is somewhere else. Let me think.

If ∠AOF is 90°, then OF is perpendicular to OA. So from point O, direction OA is towards A (along x-axis), so OF is upwards or downwards. Let's say upwards, so F is at (0,1). But then, moving to ∠FOE being 90°, which would be from OF to OE. If OF is up (positive y-axis) and OE is... Well, if E is at (0,1), then OE is same as OF, so angle ∠FOE would be zero. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence of angles is different. Let's try to map out the angles:

Assuming the right angles are at O:

1. ∠AOF = 90°, so F is located such that OF is perpendicular to OA. Let's take OA along x-axis, so OF is along positive y-axis. So F is at (0,1). 

2. Next, ∠FOE = 90°, so from OF to OE is 90°. Since OF is along positive y-axis, OE would be perpendicular to OF, i.e., along negative x-axis. So point E would be at (-1,0). But that's point B. Hmm, not good, because E is supposed to be part of diameter EC. If E is at (-1,0), then C would be at (1,0), which is point A. Not good either.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are different. Let me try again.

Let me assign:

- OA is along x-axis from O(0,0) to A(1,0).

- AB is diameter, so B(-1,0).

- EC is diameter, so let me define E and C. Let me assume E is somewhere, say, at (0,1), so C is at (0,-1).

Now, right angles at O:

∠AOF = 90°, so OF is perpendicular to OA. OA is along x-axis, so OF is along y-axis. Thus, F is at (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's pick (0,1), which is point E. But then F=E. That might not be allowed. Alternatively, if F is at (0,-1), which is point C. Again, overlapping with existing points. Not ideal.

Maybe the right angles are not in order AOF, FOE, etc. Maybe the sequence is different. Let me think of the angles ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB being consecutive right angles around point O.

Starting from OA, turning 90° to OF, then another 90° to OE, then another 90° to OD, then another 90° to OB. 

Let me try:

- Start with OA along x-axis to A(1,0).

- ∠AOF = 90°, so OF is at 90° from OA, i.e., upward y-axis. So F is at (0,1).

- ∠FOE = 90°, so from OF (upward y-axis) to OE is another 90°, so OE is at 180° from OA, i.e., pointing left along negative x-axis. So E is at (-1,0), which is point B. Not good, since E is meant to be part of diameter EC. If E is at (-1,0), then C would be at (1,0), which is point A. Conflict again.

Alternative approach: Maybe the right angles are not consecutive. Let me consider that ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB are four right angles, totaling 360°, so they divide the circle into four equal parts. Each angle is 90°, so the points F, O, E, D, B are placed every 90° from A.

But since AB is a diameter, and EC is another diameter, maybe the points are arranged such that:

Starting from A(1,0):

- Rotate 90° to reach F.

- Another 90° to reach E.

- Another 90° to reach D.

- Another 90° to reach B.

But then, after rotating 90° from A, F would be at (0,1), then E would be at (-1,0), D at (0,-1), and B at (1,0). But that brings us back to A, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged differently. Let me think about the equal measures of angles.

The Equal statement says that MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD)) are equal. Assuming these angles are at O.

So ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD are all equal. Let me denote each as θ.

Also, from the right angles: ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB are right angles (90°). Wait, if ∠FOE is 90°, then ∠EOF is also 90°, which would be one of the equal angles. So θ = 90°, hence all those angles are 90°, implying that the total around O would be 4*90° = 360°, which fits.

But how does this fit with the other angles?

For example, ∠BOD is one of the equal angles, so ∠BOD = 90°. Similarly, ∠EOF = 90°, ∠FOA = 90°, ∠DOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°.

Wait, but ∠EOD and ∠DOE are the same? No, ∠EOD is at O between E and D, while ∠DOE is at O between D and E. Same thing. So all these angles are 90°, meaning that each adjacent pair of points is separated by 90°.

So starting from point A, going counterclockwise:

- ∠AOF = 90°, so F is 90° from A.

- ∠FOE = 90°, so E is 90° from F.

- ∠EOD = 90°, so D is 90° from E.

- ∠DOB = 90°, so B is 90° from D.

But since AB is a diameter, the angle from A to B should be 180°, so let's check:

From A to F: 90°, F to E: 90°, E to D: 90°, D to B: 90°. Total from A to B is 90+90+90+90=360°, which loops around the circle. But AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B should be 180°. Hence, this suggests that the path from A to F to E to D to B covers 360°, which means that the actual arc from A to B is half of that, or something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the points are arranged such that each of these right angles corresponds to 90° steps, but the arc AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B is 180°, which would mean that the number of right-angle steps from A to B is 2 (each step 90°). So maybe the sequence is A -> F -> ... -> B, with two steps of 90°.

But how does that fit with the other points?

Let me try assigning positions:

Let me imagine the circle divided into four quadrants by diameters AB and EC.

Assume AB is horizontal, EC is vertical.

Points:

- A is (1,0)

- B is (-1,0)

- E is (0,1)

- C is (0,-1)

Now, the right angles at O are:

∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB are each 90°.

Let me try to find position of F.

From ∠AOF = 90°, so OF is perpendicular to OA. OA is along x-axis, so OF is along y-axis. Hence, F is at (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's say F is at (0,1), which is point E. But then, ∠FOE would be angle at O between F and E, which are both at (0,1) and (0,1)? No, that would collapse. So likely F is at (0,-1), which is point C. But then ∠FOE would be angle between F (point C at (0,-1)) and E (point E at (0,1)), which is a straight line through O, making ∠FOE = 180°, not 90°. Contradiction.

This suggests that my assumption about the placement is wrong. Maybe the points F, E, D are not aligned with the existing diameters.

Alternatively, perhaps F is somewhere else. Let me think.

Let me forget about the existing diameters EC and AB, and focus on the angles.

We have four right angles at O: ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB, each 90°. So starting from OA, rotating 90° to OF, then another 90° to OE, then another 90° to OD, then another 90° to OB. This would mean that the points F, E, D are placed every 90° from A to B.

So starting from A(1,0):

- Rotate 90° CCW to reach F: (0,1)

- Rotate another 90° CCW to reach E: (-1,0)

- Rotate another 90° CCW to reach D: (0,-1)

- Rotate another 90° CCW to reach B: (1,0) (but B is already at (-1,0)? No, this is conflicting.

Wait, if starting from A(1,0), rotating 90° CCW gives F at (0,1). Rotating another 90° CCW gives E at (-1,0). Rotating another 90° CCW gives D at (0,-1). Rotating another 90° CCW would bring us to (1,0), which is point A. But we need to reach B, which is (-1,0). So this suggests that the fourth rotation from D would go to B, but in this case, it goes back to A. Hence, inconsistency.

Alternatively, maybe the rotations are clockwise? Let's try:

Starting from A(1,0), rotating 90° clockwise to F: (0,-1)

Then another 90° clockwise to E: (-1,0)

Another 90° clockwise to D: (0,1)

Another 90° clockwise to B: (1,0). But B is at (-1,0). So again, inconsistency.

Hmm. It appears that arranging the points F, E, D, B in this manner conflicts with the fact that B is a endpoint of diameter AB.

Perhaps the issue is that the diameter AB is fixed, and EC is another diameter, and the right angles involve other points. Let me try to consider that.

Let me assume that AB is horizontal, from A(1,0) to B(-1,0). EC is another diameter, say from E(0,1) to C(0,-1).

Now, the right angles at O are ∠AOF, ∠FOE, ∠EOD, ∠DOB = 90°.

Let me try to find point F such that ∠AOF = 90°. As before, OF is perpendicular to OA, so F is at (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's choose F at (0,1), which is point E. But then ∠FOE would be angle at O between F(0,1) and E(0,1), which is undefined. Not good.

Choose F at (0,-1), which is point C. Then ∠FOE is angle at O between F(0,-1) and E(0,1), which is a straight line, giving 180°, not 90°. Not good.

Hence, F cannot be on the existing diameters. So perhaps F is somewhere else.

Let me consider that ∠AOF is 90°, so OF is perpendicular to OA. Let me define F at (0,1). But this is point E. So maybe E is not on the diameter EC? No, the problem states that EC is a diameter, so E and C are endpoints.

This is getting too tangled. Let me switch strategies.

The key is that the equal angles are ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD. All equal. Let's call each of these angles θ. Also, from the right angles, ∠FOE = 90°, which is one of the equal angles, so θ = 90°. Hence, all those angles are 90°.

So, ∠BOD = 90°, ∠EOF = 90°, ∠FOA = 90°, ∠DOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°.

Wait, but ∠EOD and ∠DOE are the same angle? No, ∠EOD is at O between E and D, ∠DOE is at O between D and E. Same thing. So these are the same angle, so it's counted twice. So essentially, there are four angles: ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, each equal to 90°. But since ∠EOF is already 90°, that gives us the others as 90°.

So, let's consider the entire circle around point O. The sum of all angles around point O is 360°. These angles include:

- ∠AOF = 90° (part of ∠FOA?)

Wait, let's list all the angles around O. Starting from point A, going around O, the angles between successive points.

Assuming the points are ordered A, F, E, D, B, and possibly others. Let me think:

If ∠AOF = 90°, ∠FOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°, ∠DOB = 90°, then the total is 4*90° = 360°, which wraps around the circle. So the points are arranged in order A, F, E, D, B, completing the circle.

But since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°. Let's calculate the arc from A to B via these points.

From A to F: 90°, F to E: 90°, E to D: 90°, D to B: 90°. But that totals 360°, which would mean that from A to B goes all the way around the circle, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B passes through F, E, D, and back to B, but that would mean that B is reached after 360°, which is the same as A. Contradiction.

Therefore, there must be overlap in the points. Perhaps some of the points coincide? For example, maybe D is B? Or F is E?

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not all sequential. Maybe ∠FOA is part of the angle from F to A, and ∠BOD is from B to D, etc.

Let me try to find the measure of arc AD. To do this, I need to find the central angle ∠AOD.

Let me consider the arrangement of points. Let me assume that the points are placed such that each consecutive pair forms a 90° angle at O.

Starting from A, moving 90° to F, then another 90° to E, another 90° to D, and another 90° to B. This would mean that the arc from A to F is 90°, F to E is 90°, E to D is 90°, D to B is 90°, totaling 360°, which loops back to A. But AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B should be 180°, which would mean that the arc from A to B goes through F, E, D, and back to B, which would imply that the arc from A to B is 360°, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B is actually the direct arc, which is 180°, and the other arc is 180° as well.

Wait, but if the points are arranged such that from A, going 90° to F, then 90° to E, then 90° to D, and then 90° to B, then the arc from A to B would pass through F, E, D, which is 3*90° = 270°, and the other arc from A to B directly is 90°. But since AB is a diameter, the arc should be 180°. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B via F, E, D is 270°, and the direct arc is 90°, which contradicts the diameter requirement. Hence, this setup is invalid.

At this point, I'm stuck with the current assumptions. Let me try to think differently.

The problem says that EC and AB are diameters. So, O is the midpoint of both AB and EC.

Let me assume AB is horizontal, EC is vertical.

Let me assign coordinates:

O is at (0,0).

A is (1,0), B is (-1,0).

E is (0,1), C is (0,-1).

Now, we need to find points F and D such that the given conditions hold.

The right angles are:

1. ∠AFO = 90°

2. ∠FOE = 90°

3. ∠EOD = 90°

4. ∠DOB = 90°

Let me handle each of these.

Starting with ∠AFO = 90°: this is the angle at F between A-F-O. Let me find coordinates of F such that this angle is 90°.

As before, using vector analysis. Let F be (x,y) on the circle, so x² + y² = 1.

Vectors FA and FO:

FA = A - F = (1 - x, 0 - y)

FO = O - F = (-x, -y)

Their dot product should be zero:

(1 - x)(-x) + (0 - y)(-y) = -x + x² + y² = -x + 1 = 0 => x = 1.

So x = 1, which means F is (1,0), which is point A. But F cannot be A. Hence, contradiction. This suggests that under this setup, there is no valid F except A itself, which is not allowed. Hence, there must be an error in the problem setup or my understanding.

But the problem exists, so I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me reconsider the angle notation. Perhaps the angle is not at F but at O? Let me try that.

If the angle is at O, then ∠AOF = 90°. This makes sense. Let's try this.

So, assuming ∠AOF is 90°, then OF is perpendicular to OA. Since OA is along x-axis, OF is along y-axis. Hence, F is at (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's take F at (0,1), which is point E. But then ∠FOE would be angle at O between F and E, which are both at (0,1) and (0,1)? No, if F is E, then it's the same point. Not valid.

Take F at (0,-1), which is point C. Then ∠FOE is angle at O between F(0,-1) and E(0,1), which is a straight line, giving 180°, not 90°. Not good.

So, this suggests that F is not on the existing diameters. Let me choose F elsewhere.

Let me choose F at (0,1), even though it's point E. Then, ∠FOE is 180°, but the problem says it's a right angle. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not all at O. Let me revisit the original problem statement.

The problem says:

RightAngle(Angle(A,F,O)

RightAngle(Angle(F,O,E)

RightAngle(Angle(E,O,D)

RightAngle(Angle(D,O,B)

So, these are four right angles, each at different points:

1. ∠AFO: right angle at F.

2. ∠FOE: right angle at O.

3. ∠EOD: right at O.

4. ∠DOB: right at O.

Wait, no. Let me parse each:

- Angle(A,F,O) is at F: right angle at F.

- Angle(F,O,E) is at O: right angle at O.

- Angle(E,O,D) is at O: right angle at O.

- Angle(D,O,B) is at O: right angle at O.

So, three right angles at O, and one at F.

This changes things.

So, we have:

1. ∠AFO = 90° (right angle at F).

2. ∠FOE = 90° (right angle at O).

3. ∠EOD = 90° (right angle at O).

4. ∠DOB = 90° (right angle at O).

Let me tackle these one by one.

Starting with ∠AFO = 90° at F. As before, this requires that triangle AFO is right-angled at F. As previously, this leads to AF being zero, which is impossible, unless F is chosen carefully.

But let's try to find such a point F.

Let me assume O is at (0,0), A is (1,0). Let F be a point on the circle, so x² + y² = 1.

Vector FA = A - F = (1 - x, -y).

Vector FO = O - F = (-x, -y).

These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(1 - x)(-x) + (-y)(-y) = -x + x² + y² = -x + 1 = 0 → x = 1.

So x = 1, which means F is (1,0), which is point A. Not allowed. Hence, no solution unless F=A, which is not permissible. This suggests that there is no such point F on the circle except A itself, which is contradictory. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem or in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle is at O, not at F? Let me check the notation again. Angle(A,F,O) is the angle at F, as per standard notation. So if it's at F, then this is impossible. Hence, the problem may have an error, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at O for ∠AFO? Let me try interpreting Angle(A,F,O) as angle at O, which would be ∠AOF. If that's the case, then ∠AOF = 90°, which is possible.

Assuming that, let's proceed with this interpretation, even though it's against standard notation. Let's say that the angle is at O, so ∠AOF = 90°, ∠FOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°, ∠DOB = 90°. This would make sense, and allow for a consistent solution.

With this, let's proceed.

So, ∠AOF = 90°, ∠FOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°, ∠DOB = 90°. Each of these is a right angle at O. So, starting from OA, each subsequent angle adds 90°, leading to points F, E, D, B placed every 90° around the circle.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let O be at (0,0).

Let OA be along x-axis: A(1,0).

∠AOF = 90°, so OF is perpendicular to OA, so OF is along y-axis. Hence, F is at (0,1).

∠FOE = 90°, so from OF to OE is 90°, so OE is along negative x-axis. Hence, E is at (-1,0).

∠EOD = 90°, so from OE to OD is 90°, so OD is along negative y-axis. Hence, D is at (0,-1).

∠DOB = 90°, so from OD to OB is 90°, so OB is along positive x-axis. But OB is the diameter, so B is at (1,0), which is point A. Contradiction, since B is supposed to be a distinct point.

Ah! Here's the problem. If we follow this, then B would coincide with A, which is not allowed. Hence, this suggests that the last angle ∠DOB should be from OD to OB, which would mean that OB is 90° from OD. If OD is along negative y-axis, then OB would be along positive x-axis, which is the same as OA, so B is at (1,0), which is A. Hence, contradiction.

To resolve this, perhaps the last angle is not ∠DOB but something else? Or perhaps the points are arranged differently.

Let me try to adjust the direction of the angles. Let me assume that after ∠EOD = 90°, the next angle is ∠DOB = 90°, but in a different direction.

If OD is along negative y-axis, then ∠DOB = 90° would mean that OB is 90° from OD, which is positive x-axis. So B is at (1,0), which is A. Still the same issue.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are measured in the other direction. Let me try clockwise instead of counterclockwise.

Starting from OA (x-axis), ∠AOF = 90° clockwise, so F is at (0,-1).

Then ∠FOE = 90° clockwise, so from OF (negative y-axis) to OE is 90° clockwise, which would be along negative x-axis. So E is at (-1,0).

Then ∠EOD = 90° clockwise, from OE (negative x-axis) to OD is 90° clockwise, which would be along positive y-axis. So D is at (0,1).

Then ∠DOB = 90° clockwise, from OD (positive y-axis) to OB is 90° clockwise, which would be along positive x-axis. Hence, B is at (1,0), which is A again. Still the same problem.

This suggests that the only way to satisfy all these conditions is to have B coincide with A, which is not allowed. Hence, there must be a different configuration.

Let me consider that the diameters AB and EC are not orthogonal. Let me assume that AB is not horizontal. Let me choose AB and EC to be at some angle.

But this complicates things. Let me try to think about the equal angles.

The problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(BOD), MeasureOf(Angle(EOF), MeasureOf(Angle(FOA), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), MeasureOf(Angle(EOD)) are equal. Let's call this common measure θ.

From the right angles, we have:

- ∠FOE = 90°, which is one of the equal angles, so θ = 90°.

Hence, ∠BOD = 90°, ∠EOF = 90°, ∠FOA = 90°, ∠DOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°.

Now, let's look at these angles:

- ∠BOD = 90°: this is the angle at O between B and D.

- ∠EOF = 90°: angle at O between E and F.

- ∠FOA = 90°: angle at O between F and A.

- ∠DOE = 90°: angle at O between D and E.

- ∠EOD = 90°: same as ∠DOE.

Now, let's try to arrange these angles around point O.

Starting from B, going to D is 90°, from D to E is 90°, from E to F is 90°, from F to A is 90°, and from A to B is... Let's see.

Total around O is 360°, so the sum of all these angles should be 360°. Let's add them:

∠BOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOF + ∠FOA = 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°. This suggests that the points are arranged in the order B, D, E, F, A, and back to B, forming a closed loop.

But since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°. Let's see what this implies.

The arc from A to B would pass through F, E, D, and back to B. Let's calculate the arc lengths:

From A to F: ∠FOA = 90°, so arc AF is 90°.

From F to E: ∠EOF = 90°, arc FE is 90°.

From E to D: ∠DOE = 90°, arc ED is 90°.

From D to B: ∠BOD = 90°, arc DB is 90°.

Total arc from A to B: 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which is full circle. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B is the entire circle, which is impossible. Hence, this indicates that the arc from A to B is actually the shorter arc, which would be the remaining part.

Wait, but if the total around O is 360°, and the arc from A to B is covered by the other arcs, it's unclear. Let me think differently.

Since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180°. Let's find how this relates to the other arcs.

The arc from A to B can be calculated as the sum of the arcs from A to F, F to E, E to D, and D to B, but this totals 360°, which is not possible. Hence, there must be overlap or a different path.

Alternatively, the arc from A to B could be the direct arc, which is 180°, and the other arc is 180°. Let's see if this fits.

If the arc from A to B is 180°, then the arc from A to B via F, E, D is 360° - 180° = 180°, but this would require that the sum of the arcs from A to F, F to E, E to D, D to B is 180°, but we have each of these arcs as 90°, totaling 360°. Contradiction.

This suggests that there is no solution under these constraints, which is impossible since the problem exists. Hence, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Let me try to forget about the specific positions and focus on the measure of arc AD.

The question asks for m∠AD, which is the measure of arc AD. To find this, I need to determine the central angle ∠AOD.

From the given equal angles, let's see if we can express ∠AOD in terms of θ.

We know that ∠FOA = 90°, which is the angle at O between F and A. So, if we can find the relationship between F and D, we can find ∠AOD.

From the right angles, ∠EOD = 90°, which is the angle at O between E and D. Also, ∠DOB = 90°, which is the angle at O between D and B.

Since AB is a diameter, ∠AOB = 180°. Let's see:

∠AOB = ∠AOF + ∠FOB = 90° + ∠FOB = 180°, so ∠FOB = 90°. Hence, ∠FOB = 90°.

But ∠FOB is the angle at O between F and B. Also, from the right angles, ∠FOE = 90°, so ∠FOE = 90°.

Let me try to relate these angles.

Let me consider the full circle around O. The sum of all angles around O is 360°. Let's list the angles:

- ∠AOF = 90°

- ∠FOE = 90°

- ∠EOD = 90°

- ∠DOB = 90°

But this sums to 4*90° = 360°, so the points are arranged in the order A, F, E, D, B, and back to A. This means that the arc from A to B passes through F, E, D, and the arc length is 360°, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B is actually the other arc, which would be 0°, which is not possible.

However, since AB is a diameter, the arc AB must be 180°, so the arc from A to B must be 180°, which implies that the sum of the angles from A to B via F, E, D must be 180°. But according to our previous calculation, it's 360°, which is a contradiction. This suggests that the arc from A to B is actually the sum of some of these angles.

Let me think: if the total around O is 360°, and the arc from A to B is 180°, then the remaining arc from B to A is also 180°. Let me try to find the arc AD.

Let me try to find ∠AOD. Let's see:

From point A, going to D. The arc from A to D can be calculated by adding the angles from A to F, F to E, E to D. But if ∠AOF = 90°, ∠FOE = 90°, ∠EOD = 90°, then the arc from A to D is 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, but this is the major arc AD. The minor arc AD would be 360° - 270° = 90°. But since the problem asks for arc AD, it depends on whether it's the minor or major arc. Usually, in such problems, the smaller arc is considered unless specified otherwise.

But let's verify. If the arc from A to D is 90°, then m∠AD = 90°, which is option A. But let me check.

Wait, if the arc from A to D is 90°, then the central angle ∠AOD is 90°, so the arc measure is 90°. But how?

Let me think: if from A to F is 90°, F to E is 90°, E to D is 90°, then from A to D is 270°, but if the arc AD is the minor arc, it would be 90°. But how?

Wait, if the points are arranged as A, F, E, D, B, then the arc from A to D can be either the short way (through F and E) or the long way (through B). The short way would be A to F to E to D, which is 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, which is the long arc. The short arc would be the other way, which is A to B to D. But since AB is a diameter, and BD is part of the arc from B to D.

Wait, ∠DOB = 90°, so the arc from D to B is 90°. Hence, the arc from B to D is 90°, and since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B is 180°. Hence, the arc from A to D would be arc AB (180°) plus arc BD (90°), totaling 270°, or the other way, arc AD is the arc from A to D through F, E, which is 270°, or the other arc is 90°. Hence, the measure of arc AD is 90° or 270°, depending on which arc is intended.

But the problem asks for m∠AD, which typically refers to the minor arc unless stated otherwise. Hence, it would be 90°, which is option A.

But let me confirm this.

If the arc AD is 90°, then the central angle ∠AOD is 90°, so the measure is 90°, which is option A.

But let me check if this makes sense with the given conditions.

If arc AD is 90°, then ∠AOD = 90°. Let me see if this aligns with the other angles.

From the equal angles, ∠FOA = 90°, which is the angle between F and A. If ∠AOD = 90°, then D is 90° from A. If F is 90° from A, and D is 90° from A, then F and D would be the same point, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests a contradiction.

Wait, this indicates a problem. If ∠AOD = 90°, then D is 90° from A, but ∠FOA = 90° means F is also 90° from A. Hence, F and D would be the same point, which is not allowed. Hence, this suggests that the arc AD is not 90°.

Let me try another approach. Let's assume that the arc from A to D is x°, and try to find x.

From the given equal angles, we have:

- ∠AOF = 90°, so arc AF is 90°.

- ∠FOE = 90°, so arc FE is 90°.

- ∠EOD = 90°, so arc ED is 90°.

- ∠DOB = 90°, so arc DB is 90°.

Now, the total arc from A to B is arc AF + FE + ED + DB = 90° + 90° + 90° + 9° = 360°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B is actually the sum of some of these arcs.

Since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180°. Let's assume that the arc from A to B is composed of arc AF + FB. We know arc AF is 90°, so arc FB must be 90° to make 180°. Hence, arc FB = 90°.

But arc FB is from F to B. How does this relate to other arcs?

From the above, arc FE is 90°, and arc ED is 90°, and arc DB is 90°. So from F to B, it's arc FE + ED + DB = 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, which contradicts the needed 90°. Hence, this is inconsistent.

This suggests that there is a fundamental flaw in the assumptions, and I need to find another way.

Let me try to focus on the measure of arc AD. Let's assume that the arc AD is x°, and try to relate it to the given angles.

From the equal angles, ∠FOA = 90°, which is the angle between F and A. Let's say arc FA is 90°. Similarly, ∠EOD = 90°, so arc ED is 90°. 

Now, the arc from A to D would depend on the position of D relative to A. If D is on the opposite side of E from A, then the arc AD would be arc AE + ED. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, let's consider the total circle. If we have arc AF = 90°, arc FE = 90°, arc ED = 90°, arc DB = 90°, then the total is 360°, which implies that the arc from A to B is 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that some of these arcs overlap or are part of the same arc.

Maybe the arc from A to B is 180°, and the other arcs are parts of it. Let me try to break it down.

If arc AB is 180°, and it includes arc AF (90°), then the remaining arc from F to B is 90°. This arc from F to B would be arc FE + ED + DB = 90°, but we have arc FE = 90°, which would make the rest 0°. Hence, this is not possible.

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to recall that the problem says "EC and AB are diameters", and the equal angles are ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD. Let me focus on these.

Let me consider that ∠BOD = 90°, so arc BD is 90°.

∠EOF = 90°, so arc EF is 90°.

∠FOA = 90°, so arc FA is 90°.

∠DOE = 90°, so arc DE is 90°.

Now, let's try to find the arc AD.

From A to D, we can go through F and E: arc AF + FE + ED = 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°. Or through B: arc AB + BD = 180° + 90° = 270°. Hence, both paths give 270°, which is the major arc AD. The minor arc AD would be 360° - 270° = 90°. Hence, the measure of arc AD is 90°, which is option A.

But earlier, this led to a contradiction when assuming F and D are distinct points. But perhaps the problem considers the minor arc AD, which is 90°, despite the apparent contradictions in the positioning. Given that, the answer would be A.

But let me verify with the given choices. Option A is 45, B is 135, C is 180, D is 360. If the arc AD is 90°, but 90° is not among the options. Wait, the options are A. 45, B. 135, C. 180, D. 360. Wait, 90° is not listed. This suggests that my conclusion is wrong.

Wait, this is critical. If the arc AD is 90°, but it's not an option, then I must have made a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "Find m∠AD." Wait, maybe it's asking for the measure of the arc AD, which is 90°, but if that's not an option, then I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are A. 45, B. 135, C. 180, D. 360. None of these is 90°, so this suggests that my previous conclusion is wrong. Hence, I must have made a mistake in calculating the arc AD.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the equal angles are all 90°, and the total around O is 360°, so the points are arranged such that each of the angles ∠BOD, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, ∠DOE, ∠EOD is 90°, and the rest of the circle is filled by other arcs.

Let me consider that the arc AD is composed of some of these angles.

Let me try to draw the circle with O at center, and mark the points.

Since AB is a diameter, let's place A at (1,0) and B at (-1,0).

EC is another diameter, so let's place E at (0,1) and C at (0,-1).

Now, the right angles are:

1. ∠AFO = 90° (at F)

2. ∠FOE = 90° (at O)

3. ∠EOD = 90° (at O)

4. ∠DOB = 90° (at O)

Let me find point F such that ∠AFO = 90°. As before, this requires F to be at (1,0) or (0,1), but these are points A or E. Let's assume F is at (0,1), which is E. Then ∠FOE is the angle at O between F (E) and E, which is undefined. Not good.

Alternatively, let me assume F is somewhere else. Let me use the condition that ∠FOE = 90°, which is at O. So, ∠FOE = 90°, which means that OF is perpendicular to OE. Since E is at (0,1), OE is along positive y-axis. Hence, OF must be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. But OF is a radius, so if OF is along x-axis, then F is at (1,0) or (-1,0). But (1,0) is A, (-1,0) is B.

Let me choose F at (1,0), which is A. But then ∠AFO is at F, which is A, making it undefined. Not good.

Choose F at (-1,0), which is B. Then ∠AFO is at F (B), so angle at B between A, B, O. This is ∠ABO, which is 90°? Let me check. If F is B, then ∠AFO is ∠ABO, which is the angle at B between A, B, O. Since AB is a diameter, and O is the center, ∠ABO is 90°? No, because in triangle ABO, OA and OB are radii, and AB is a diameter, so triangle ABO is a right triangle at O, not at B. Hence, ∠ABO is not 90°. Hence, this is not valid.

This suggests that there is no valid position for F, which indicates a fundamental issue with the problem setup. Given that, and since the problem is from a source, I must proceed with the assumption that the arc AD is 90°, even though it's not an option, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the options. The options are A. 45, B. 135, C. 180, D. 360. If the arc AD is 90°, and none of the options is 90°, then perhaps the correct answer is 135°, which is option B.

How? Let me think: if the arc AD is 135°, then it would be the sum of some of the angles.

Let me try to think of the total circle as 360°, and the given angles.

If the equal angles are 90°, and there are four of them, totaling 360°, then the arc AD could be part of this.

Wait, if the arc from A to D is 135°, then it would be 3/4 of 180°, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, let me consider that the arc AD is composed of ∠AOF + ∠FOE + ∠EOD = 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, but this is the major arc, and the minor arc is 90°,
