QUESTION:
A square is inscribed in a circle having a radius of 6 inches. Find the length of the side of the square.

CHOICES:
A. \frac { 3 } { \sqrt 2 }
B. 3 \sqrt 2
C. 6 \sqrt 2
D. 12 \sqrt 2

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches. We need to find the length of the side of the square. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some geometry concepts here.

First, when a square is inscribed in a circle, all four corners of the square touch the circumference of the circle. That means the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Wait, right? Because the diagonal would stretch from one point on the circle through the center to the opposite point, making it the diameter. 

So, if the radius is 6 inches, then the diameter is twice that, which would be 12 inches. So the diagonal of the square is 12 inches. Now, I need to relate the diagonal of the square to its side length. 

I remember that for a square, the diagonal divides it into two right-angled triangles. Each triangle has legs of length 's' (the side of the square) and the hypotenuse is the diagonal. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal squared equals s squared plus s squared. So, diagonal² = 2s². Therefore, diagonal = s√2. 

Wait, so if the diagonal is 12 inches, then 12 = s√2. To find s, divide both sides by √2. So s = 12 / √2. But usually, rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2 to get (12√2)/2, which simplifies to 6√2. 

Let me check if that makes sense. If the radius is 6, diameter 12. Then the side of the square is 6√2. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 6√2. So that should be the answer. 

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a mistake here. Let me go through again. The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. Radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Diagonal d = 12. For square, d = s√2. Solving for s gives s = d / √2 = 12 / √2 = 6√2 after rationalizing. Yes, that seems correct. 

Looking at the answer choices, C is 6√2, so that's the answer. Let me just check if I didn't confuse radius and diameter. The circle's radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Correct. And the diagonal of the square is the diameter. Yep. So the calculation is right. 

Another way to think about it: if the square is inscribed in the circle, then the center of the circle is also the center of the square. The distance from the center to any corner (which is the radius) can be related to the side of the square. Let me see. The radius is half the diagonal. So, radius r = (d)/2. Which means d = 2r. So substituting back, d = 2*6=12. Then as before, s = d/√2 = 12/√2 = 6√2. Same result. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. 6√2. So the correct choice is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of the side of a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches, we begin by recognizing a key geometric relationship between the square and the circle:

---

### **Geometric Insight**

When a square is inscribed in a circle, its **diagonal** becomes the **diameter** of the circle. This is because the diagonal passes through the center of the circle and connects two opposite vertices of the square.

Given:
- Radius $ r = 6 $
- Therefore, **diameter** $ d = 2r = 12 $

This tells us the **length of the diagonal of the square is 12 inches**.

---

### **Relating Side Length to Diagonal**

For a square with side length $ s $, the **diagonal** forms a right triangle with two sides of the square. Applying the **Pythagorean Theorem**, we derive:

$$
\text{Diagonal}^2 = s^2 + s^2 = 2s^2 \Rightarrow \text{Diagonal} = s\sqrt{2}
$$

Substitute the known value of the diagonal:

$$
s\sqrt{2} = 12 \Rightarrow s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Rationalizing the denominator:

$$
s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The side length of the square is therefore:

$$
\boxed{6\sqrt{2}}
$$

Which matches **Answer Choice C**.
