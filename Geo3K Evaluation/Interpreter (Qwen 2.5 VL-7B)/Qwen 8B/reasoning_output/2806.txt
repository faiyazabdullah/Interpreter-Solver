MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral ABCD. The points are labeled A, B, C, D connected as AB, BC, CD, DA. The constraints given are that angle at B is a right angle (so 90 degrees), lines AB and AD are parallel. Also, angles at A and D are equal. Wait, no—let me check again. The problem says:

- RightAngle(Angle(B): so angle at point B is 90 degrees.
- Parallel(Line(A,B) and Parallel(Line(A,D). Wait, Line(A,B) is AB, and Line(A,D) is AD? Wait, but if AB is parallel to AD, then those two lines would meet at point A. But if two lines meet at a point, they can't be parallel unless they're the same line. That seems impossible. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, the original statement says: Parallel(Line(A,B) and Parallel(Line(A,D). Wait, that would mean Line AB is parallel to Line AD? But AB and AD both start at point A. If two lines start at the same point and are parallel, they must be the same line, which isn't possible unless the quadrilateral is degenerate. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps it's supposed to say Line AB is parallel to Line CD or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in writing the constraints. Let me recheck the original question.

The problem states:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)
Point(A)
Point(B)
Point(C)
Point(D)
Line(A,B)
Line(B,C)
Line(C,D)
Line(D,A)
RightAngle(Angle(B)
Parallel(Line(A,B)
Parallel(Line(A,D)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D)"

So the constraints are:

- Quadrilateral ABCD with sides AB, BC, CD, DA.
- Angle at B is a right angle (90°).
- Line AB is parallel to Line AD?
Wait, that's conflicting because AB and AD share point A. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe it's supposed to be Line AB is parallel to Line DC? Because that makes more sense for a parallelogram. Alternatively, maybe Line AB is parallel to Line CD, and Line AD is parallel to Line BC? But the way it's written is "Parallel(Line(A,B)" and "Parallel(Line(A,D)", meaning AB || AD and AD || AB? Which would imply AB is parallel to itself, which is trivial. But that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in how the constraints are written. For example, maybe it was intended that AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC, making it a parallelogram. However, the given constraints mention Parallel(Line(A,B) and Parallel(Line(A,D). So that would mean AB is parallel to AD. But since they meet at A, this is only possible if AB and AD are the same line, which would make the quadrilateral collapse into a triangle. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. 

But maybe there's another interpretation. Perhaps the problem meant that AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC? That would make it a parallelogram. However, the way the constraints are written is unclear. Let me assume that there might be a typo, and that the intended constraints were that AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Since that's a common property of parallelograms. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a trapezoid. For instance, if AB is parallel to CD (the bases), and AD is one of the legs. Then, angle at B being 90 degrees could make it a right trapezoid. But then angles at A and D are equal. Let me think through that possibility.

Let me proceed under the assumption that there was a typo and that the intended constraints are that AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC, making it a parallelogram. However, given that angle at B is 90 degrees, then all angles would be 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. But then angles at A and D would also be 90 degrees, which matches the Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D). However, the problem says "equals measure of angle A equals measure of angle D", which would hold in a rectangle. Then, angle C would also be 90 degrees. But that would make answer B (90). However, the answer choices include 90 as option B, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, but the initial constraints may not support that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not a parallelogram. Let me go back to the original constraints as written, even though they seem contradictory.

Original constraints:

- AB is parallel to AD? Which would mean AB || AD. But since these two lines intersect at point A, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Hence, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem had a mistake in the constraints. For example, maybe it should be that AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Let me consider that scenario.

Assuming that the constraints meant AB || CD and AD || BC (i.e., a parallelogram). Then, since angle B is 90 degrees, then all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. In that case, angle C would also be 90 degrees. But let's see if that fits with the other constraints. The problem mentions that measure of angle A equals measure of angle D. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But if angle B is 90 degrees, then angle D is also 90 degrees, so angle A equals angle D implies angle A = 90 degrees. Thus, all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. So angle C would be 90 degrees. Hence, answer B.

However, the original constraints as written don't specify that AB || CD or AD || BC. They say AB || AD and AD || AB (which is redundant). This suggests that maybe the problem has a mistake in the constraints. Another possibility is that the problem intended to state that AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Given that, then angle B is 90 degrees, leading to a rectangle, hence angle C is 90 degrees. But if there's another configuration, such as a trapezoid.

Alternatively, suppose that AB is parallel to CD, making it a trapezoid, and angle B is 90 degrees. Then, angle A and angle D are equal. Let's explore this.

In a trapezoid with AB || CD, and angle B is 90 degrees. Then, since AB || CD, angle B and angle C are supplementary. Because consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So angle B + angle C = 180 degrees. Since angle B is 90 degrees, angle C would be 90 degrees. But then angle A and angle D are equal. In a trapezoid, base angles are equal if it's isosceles, but here angle A and angle D are equal. However, if AB || CD and angle B is 90 degrees, then angle A would be adjacent to angle B. If AB is horizontal and BC is vertical (since angle B is 90 degrees), then AD would form some angle. Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally.

Imagine AB is horizontal, going from left to right. Point B is at the right end of AB. Since angle at B is 90 degrees, then BC goes upward from B. Now, CD connects to D, which connects back to A. Since AB || CD, CD must be horizontal too. So CD is parallel to AB. Then, since AB is horizontal, CD is also horizontal. Now, the side DA connects D to A. If AB is horizontal and CD is horizontal, then DA connects D to A. Now, angle at A is equal to angle at D.

Let me assign coordinates to visualize. Let’s place point A at (0,0). Since AB is horizontal, let's say AB is along x-axis. Let’s say AB has length 'a', so point B is at (a, 0). Angle at B is 90 degrees, so BC is vertical upwards. Let’s say BC has length 'b', so point C is at (a, b). Since CD is parallel to AB (horizontal), so CD must be horizontal. From point C(a,b), moving horizontally to D. Since CD is horizontal, D would be at (c, b), where c is some value. Then DA connects D(c,b) back to A(0,0). 

Now, angle at A is the angle between AB (from A to B, direction vector (a,0)) and AD (from A to D, direction vector (c,b)). Similarly, angle at D is the angle between DC (from D to C, direction vector (a - c, 0)) and DA (from D to A, direction vector (-c, -b)).

Given that angle A equals angle D. Let me compute these angles using vectors or slopes.

First, angle at A: between AB and AD. Vector AB is (a,0), vector AD is (c,b). The angle between them can be found via dot product:

cos(theta_A) = (AB · AD)/(|AB| |AD|) = (a*c + 0*b)/(a * sqrt(c² + b²)) ) = c / sqrt(c² + b²).

Similarly, angle at D: between DC and DA. Vector DC is (a - c, 0), vector DA is (-c, -b). The angle between DC and DA:

cos(theta_D) = (DC · DA)/(|DC| |DA|) = [(a - c)(-c) + 0*(-b)] / (sqrt((a - c)^2 + 0^2) * sqrt(c² + b²)) )

= [ -c(a - c) ] / [ |a - c| * sqrt(c² + b²) ]

Since a - c could be positive or negative. Assuming that the quadrilateral is convex, and since CD is parallel to AB, likely c > a, so that D is to the right of C. Wait, but if CD is parallel to AB, which is horizontal, then CD is horizontal. If AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,0), and CD is horizontal, then starting from C(a,b), moving horizontally to D. Depending on the direction, D could be to the right or left. If it's to the right, then c > a; if to the left, c < a.

But if the quadrilateral is simple and non-intersecting, probably D is to the right. Let's assume c > a. Then a - c is negative, so |a - c| = c - a. Then:

cos(theta_D) becomes [ -c(a - c) ] / [ (c - a) * sqrt(...) ] = [ -c(a - c) ] / [ (c - a) * ... ] = [ c(c - a) ] / [ (c - a) * ... ] = c / sqrt(...). So cos(theta_D) = c / sqrt(c² + b²). Which is the same as theta_A. Therefore, angle A equals angle D. So this condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, with AB || CD and angle B = 90 degrees, the condition that angle A equals angle D holds. So this setup satisfies all the given constraints. Now, what is angle C?

In this trapezoid, angle C is at point C(a,b). The sides meeting at C are BC (vertical up from B) and CD (horizontal right from C). So angle at C is between BC (vertical) and CD (horizontal). Since BC is vertical (upward) and CD is horizontal (right), the angle at C is 90 degrees. Because vertical and horizontal directions are perpendicular. Therefore, angle C is 90 degrees. Hence, answer B.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe there's a different configuration. But according to this analysis, angle C is 90 degrees. However, the answer choices include 90 as option B. But wait, let me confirm once again. Suppose AB || CD, angle B is 90 degrees, then angle C is between BC (perpendicular to AB) and CD (parallel to AB). So angle at C is between a vertical line and a horizontal line, hence 90 degrees. So angle C is 90 degrees. Therefore, answer B. 

But why does the problem mention that angle A equals angle D? In this case, they are equal because of the symmetry. For example, if the trapezoid is symmetric, but even without symmetry, in our earlier calculation, angle A and angle D are equal due to the way the vectors work. So this setup satisfies all conditions. Therefore, angle C is 90 degrees, so answer B.

But wait, another possibility: what if the trapezoid is not right-angled at C? Wait, in the above scenario, it is right-angled at C. But if the trapezoid is not right-angled at C, then angle C would not be 90 degrees. But according to the previous reasoning, when AB || CD and angle B is 90 degrees, angle C is forced to be 90 degrees. Is that necessarily true?

Yes, because if AB is horizontal and CD is horizontal, and BC is vertical (since angle B is 90 degrees), then CD is horizontal, so from point C(a,b), moving horizontally to D. So the segment CD is horizontal, and BC is vertical. Therefore, angle at C is between vertical BC and horizontal CD, hence 90 degrees. So angle C is 90 degrees regardless. Therefore, answer B.

But let me check for alternative scenarios. What if AB is not horizontal? Suppose AB is some line, and AD is parallel to AB? Wait, earlier confusion arises here. If AB is parallel to AD, but they meet at A, which is impossible unless AB and AD are the same line. Therefore, this suggests that the original problem has a mistake in constraints. But assuming that the correct constraints are AB || CD and AD || BC (parallelogram), then angle B is 90 degrees, making all angles 90 degrees, hence angle C is 90 degrees. So answer B.

Alternatively, if the problem is a trapezoid with AB || CD, angle B is 90 degrees, and angles A and D are equal. As shown earlier, angle C is 90 degrees. So either way, answer B.

But wait, looking back at the problem, the original constraints said "Parallel(Line(A,B) and Parallel(Line(A,D)". If that's taken literally, it's impossible. So the only way this makes sense is if there's a mistake in the problem's constraints. Given that, but considering the most plausible corrected version, which leads to angle C being 90 degrees, answer B.

But wait, the answer choices include 135 as option C. Could there be a case where angle C is 135 degrees? Let me think. Suppose the trapezoid is not right-angled at C. How could that happen?

If AB is parallel to CD, and angle B is 90 degrees, but angle C is not 90 degrees. Wait, how? For example, if BC is not perpendicular to CD. Wait, but if AB || CD and angle B is 90 degrees, then BC must be perpendicular to AB. Since AB is parallel to CD, then BC would be perpendicular to CD as well. Hence, angle at C would be 90 degrees. So angle C must be 90 degrees. Therefore, answer B.

Thus, despite the confusing constraints, the most logical conclusion is that angle C is 90 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $\angle C$ in quadrilateral $ABCD$, we begin by analyzing the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Constraints**

We are told:

1. **$\angle B$** is a right angle ($90^\circ$).
2. **Lines $AB$ and $AD$** are parallel.
3. **Angles at $A$ and $D$** are equal.
4. The shape is a **quadrilateral**, with vertices connected in order: $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow A$.

---

### **Step 2: Resolving Ambiguity in Constraints**

One key issue lies in the constraint that **lines $AB$ and $AD$** are parallel. This appears problematic because both lines originate from point $A$. Two distinct lines originating from the same point cannot be parallel unless they are coincident (i.e., the same line), which would reduce the quadrilateral to a triangle — a degenerate case.

This suggests the constraint likely contains a typo or ambiguity. A more meaningful interpretation involves interpreting the intention behind the constraint: instead of saying **$AB \parallel AD$**, it's more reasonable to assume the intended constraint is:

> **Lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel**, and **lines $BC$ and $AD$ are parallel**.

This forms a **parallelogram** (or possibly a **trapezoid** depending on specific details), which aligns better with typical geometric setups involving right angles and equal angles.

---

### **Step 3: Interpreting as a Parallelogram**

Assuming the correct interpretation is:

- **$AB \parallel CD$**
- **$BC \parallel AD$**

Then the quadrilateral is a **parallelogram**, and the following properties apply:

- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- If one angle is $90^\circ$, then all four angles are $90^\circ$, forming a **rectangle**.

---

### **Step 4: Applying Given Information**

From the problem:

- $\angle B = 90^\circ$
- In a parallelogram, **opposite angles are equal**: $\angle A = \angle C$, $\angle B = \angle D$
- Since $\angle B = 90^\circ$, it follows that $\angle D = 90^\circ$

Also, we’re told:

- $\angle A = \angle D$, which confirms that $\angle A = \angle D = 90^\circ$

Hence, all angles are $90^\circ$, confirming the quadrilateral is a **rectangle**.

---

### **Step 5: Finding $\angle C$**

In a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles. So:

$$
\angle C = 90^\circ
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

**Final Answer: B**
