MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with points P, Q, R. CP is an altitude, CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB, and R is the midpoint of AB. We need to find the measure of angle ACQ, given that the measure of angle ACB is 123 - x and the measure of angle QCB is 42 + x. The answer choices are A. 40, B. 45, C. 50, D. 55.

First, let me visualize the triangle. Let me sketch it mentally. Triangle ABC, with point C connected to P (altitude), so CP is perpendicular to AB since it's an altitude. Then CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB, meaning it splits angle ACB into two equal parts. Also, R is the midpoint of AB, so AR = RB.

The key here seems to be using the information about angles. Since CQ is the angle bisector, then angle ACQ should be half of angle ACB? Wait, no. Wait, angle ACB is being bisected by CQ, so angle ACQ equals angle QCB. But wait, the problem says that measure of angle ACB is 123 - x, and measure of angle QCB is 42 + x. Hmm, but if CQ is the angle bisector, then angle ACQ should equal angle QCB. Therefore, angle ACB would be twice angle QCB. Wait, but according to the problem, angle ACB is given as 123 - x, and angle QCB is 42 + x. If they are equal because of the angle bisector, then:

Let me write equations. Let’s denote angle ACB as θ. Then, since CQ is the angle bisector, angle ACQ = angle QCB = θ/2. However, according to the problem statement, angle ACB is given as 123 - x, and angle QCB is 42 + x. So substituting:

θ = 123 - x

and angle QCB = 42 + x.

But since angle QCB is part of angle ACB, which is split into two equal parts by the bisector. Therefore, angle QCB should be equal to angle ACQ, each being θ / 2. Therefore:

θ / 2 = 42 + x

But θ is also equal to 123 - x. Therefore:

(123 - x)/2 = 42 + x

Now, solving for x:

Multiply both sides by 2:

123 - x = 84 + 2x

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

123 - 84 = 2x + x

39 = 3x => x = 13

So, x is 13. Now, we can find angle ACB:

θ = 123 - x = 123 - 13 = 110 degrees.

Then, angle ACQ is θ / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55 degrees. Wait, but that would mean angle ACQ is 55 degrees, which is option D. But let me check again.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "measure of angle QCB is 42 + x". But if CQ is the angle bisector, then angle QCB should be equal to angle ACQ, right? Because the angle bisector divides angle ACB into two equal angles. Therefore, angle ACQ = angle QCB. Hence, angle ACB = angle ACQ + angle QCB = 2 * angle QCB.

Therefore, angle ACB = 2*(42 + x) = 84 + 2x. But the problem states that angle ACB is 123 - x. Therefore:

Set them equal:

84 + 2x = 123 - x

Adding x to both sides:

84 + 3x = 123

Subtract 84:

3x = 39 => x = 13.

Same as before. Then angle ACB is 123 - 13 = 110 degrees, so angle ACQ is half of that, which is 55 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be D. 55.

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't a trick here. Is there something else I'm missing?

Wait, the problem mentions R is the midpoint of AB, but does that affect anything here? The question is about angle ACQ, which relates to the angle bisector. Maybe the fact that R is the midpoint is irrelevant here? Or maybe there's more to it?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to set up some relationships between the midline and the angle bisector? But since the question only gives info about angle measures and the angle bisector, maybe that R being the midpoint is just extra info? Or maybe there's another way to approach it?

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in assuming angle QCB is equal to angle ACQ?

Wait, angle ACB is at point C, between AC and BC. The angle bisector CQ splits angle ACB into two angles: angle ACQ and angle QCB. So yes, those two angles should be equal. Therefore, angle ACQ = angle QCB. Therefore, angle ACB = 2*angle QCB. Which leads us to the equation above. Therefore, solving gives x=13, leading to angle ACQ = 55 degrees. So answer D.

But let me check once again. Suppose angle ACB is 110 degrees, angle QCB is 42 + x = 42+13=55 degrees. Then angle ACQ is also 55 degrees. Wait, but that would make angle ACB = 55 + 55 = 110, which matches. So that works. Therefore, angle ACQ is 55 degrees, which is option D.

But why is there an option D.55? So the answer should be D. So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle ACQ $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying the properties of angle bisectors.

### **Step 1: Understanding Given Information**

- $ \triangle ABC $ with:
  - $ CP $ is an **altitude**, implying $ CP \perp AB $
  - $ CQ $ is the **angle bisector** of $ \angle ACB $
  - $ R $ is the **midpoint** of segment $ AB $

We are told:

- $ m\angle ACB = 123 - x $
- $ m\angle QCB = 42 + x $
- Need to find $ m\angle ACQ $

---

### **Step 2: Using Angle Bisector Property**

Since $ CQ $ is the **angle bisector** of $ \angle ACB $, it divides the angle into **two equal parts**:

$$
m\angle ACQ = m\angle QCB
$$

Also, from the angle addition property:

$$
m\angle ACB = m\angle ACQ + m\angle QCB
$$

Using the above equality, substitute:

$$
m\angle ACB = 2 \cdot m\angle QCB
$$

Given expressions:

$$
m\angle ACB = 123 - x,\quad m\angle QCB = 42 + x
$$

Plug these into the relation:

$$
123 - x = 2(42 + x)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

Expand and simplify:

$$
123 - x = 84 + 2x \\
123 - 84 = 2x + x \\
39 = 3x \\
x = 13
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ m\angle ACQ $**

From earlier, since $ m\angle ACQ = m\angle QCB $, use the value of $ x $:

$$
m\angle QCB = 42 + x = 42 + 13 = 55^\circ
$$

Thus,

$$
m\angle ACQ = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle ACQ $ is $ 55^\circ $. This corresponds to **option D**.

---

**Final Answer: D**
