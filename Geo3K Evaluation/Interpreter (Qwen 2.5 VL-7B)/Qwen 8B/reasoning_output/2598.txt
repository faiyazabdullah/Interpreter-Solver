MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two similar triangles, triangle RUW and triangle STV. The question is asking for the perimeter of triangle RUW, given some side lengths of triangle STV and one side length of triangle RUW. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides should be in proportion. The ratio of similarity would be the same between corresponding sides. But I need to make sure which sides correspond to each other. Wait, the problem mentions that triangle RUW is similar to triangle STV. But how do I know which sides correspond? Usually, the order of the letters matters in similar triangles. So, Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V). That means angle R corresponds to angle S, angle U to T, and angle W to V. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles should be proportional.

Let me recall: In similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So, side RU corresponds to side ST, UW corresponds to TV, and RW corresponds to SV. Wait, but maybe I need to check again. Let me think about the vertices. If the triangles are named in order, then each vertex corresponds. So:

- Vertex R corresponds to S
- Vertex U corresponds to T
- Vertex W corresponds to V

Therefore, the sides opposite these vertices would be:

In triangle RUW:

- Side opposite R is UW
- Side opposite U is RW
- Side opposite W is RU

Wait, no. Wait, in a triangle ABC, the side opposite vertex A is BC. So applying that here:

For triangle RUW:

- Side opposite R is UW (since R is connected to U and W)
- Side opposite U is RW
- Side opposite W is RU

Similarly, for triangle STV:

- Side opposite S is TV
- Side opposite T is SV
- Side opposite V is ST

But since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. However, the correspondence is based on the order of the vertices. Since the similarity is stated as Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V), so the order is important. Therefore, side RU in triangle RUW corresponds to side ST in triangle STV. Then side UW corresponds to TV, and side RW corresponds to SV. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the order of the vertices. For example, in similar triangles, the first vertex of the first triangle corresponds to the first vertex of the second triangle. So:

R corresponds to S,

U corresponds to T,

W corresponds to V.

Thus, the sides:

RU corresponds to ST,

UW corresponds to TV,

RW corresponds to SV.

So, the ratio of similarity is RU/ST = UW/TV = RW/SV.

Given that, we can find the ratio of similarity using the given sides. Wait, the problem gives us ST = 24, VS = 12, VT = 18, and UW = 21. Wait, hold on. Let me parse the given values again.

The problem says: "S T = 24, V S = 12, V T = 18 and U W = 21."

Wait, so ST = 24, VS = 12, VT = 18, and UW = 21. Let me confirm the notation. In triangle STV, the sides are ST, TV, and VS? Or wait, triangle STV has sides ST, TV, and VS? Because in triangle STV, the three sides are between points S-T, T-V, and V-S. So yes, the sides are ST, TV, and VS. Wait, but in terms of the triangle's sides, each pair of vertices defines a side. So for triangle STV, the sides are ST, TV, and VS. 

Now, given that triangle RUW ~ triangle STV, so the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Now, we need to identify which sides correspond. As per the order of the vertices, RUW corresponds to STV. So:

RU corresponds to ST,

UW corresponds to TV,

RW corresponds to SV.

So, if we can find the ratio between the sides of triangle STV and triangle RUW, we can find the missing sides.

But we are told that UW = 21. Which corresponds to TV in triangle STV. So, let's see: TV is a side in triangle STV. What's the value of TV?

Wait, the problem states that in triangle STV, the sides are ST=24, VS=12, VT=18. Wait, but VT is the same as TV. So TV = VT = 18. Therefore, TV is 18. And UW is given as 21. So, according to the similarity ratio, the ratio of UW / TV = ratio of similarity.

So, the ratio of triangle RUW to triangle STV is UW / TV = 21 / 18. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 3: 7/6. So the ratio of similarity is 7/6. That means each side of triangle RUW is 7/6 times the corresponding side of triangle STV.

But wait, actually, the ratio could be either way depending on which triangle is larger. Let me check. If triangle RUW is similar to triangle STV, then the ratio could be RUW : STV. So if UW corresponds to TV, then the ratio is UW / TV = 21 / 18 = 7/6. So that would mean that triangle RUW is larger than triangle STV by a factor of 7/6.

Therefore, to find the perimeter of triangle RUW, we can compute the perimeter of triangle STV multiplied by the ratio 7/6. Alternatively, we can compute each side of triangle RUW by multiplying the corresponding sides of STV by 7/6, then add them up.

But first, let's verify the sides of triangle STV. We have ST = 24, VS = 12, VT = 18. Wait, but triangle STV has three sides: ST, TV, and VS. Wait, but ST is 24, TV is 18, and VS is 12. Let me check if those form a valid triangle. Let's see: 12 + 18 > 24? 30 > 24, yes. 12 + 24 > 18: 36>18 yes. 18+24>12: yes. So it's a valid triangle.

So, the perimeter of triangle STV is 24 + 18 + 12 = 54. Then, the perimeter of triangle RUW would be 54 * (7/6). Let me calculate that: 54 divided by 6 is 9, multiplied by 7 is 63. So the perimeter of triangle RUW would be 63. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 63. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes the ratio can be inverted if I mixed up which triangle is larger.

Wait, another approach: since UW corresponds to TV. So, UW is a side of triangle RUW, and TV is a side of triangle STV. Given that the ratio of similarity is RUW / STV = 21 / 18 = 7/6. Therefore, all sides of RUW are 7/6 times the corresponding sides of STV. Thus, the perimeter of RUW is 7/6 times the perimeter of STV. Perimeter of STV is 24 + 18 + 12 = 54. Multiply by 7/6: 54*(7/6)= (54/6)*7=9*7=63. So that's 63. So answer A.

But wait, let me make sure that the correspondence of sides is correct. Suppose that the correspondence is such that RU corresponds to ST, UW corresponds to TV, and RW corresponds to VS. So, in triangle STV, the sides are ST=24, TV=18, VS=12. So, if UW corresponds to TV, then UW=21 is corresponding to TV=18. Hence, the ratio is 21/18 = 7/6. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion about which sides correspond. Let me check again. The similarity statement is Triangle(R,U,W) ~ Triangle(S,T,V). So the order is important. So the first side of RUW, which is RU, corresponds to the first side of STV, which is ST. The second side of RUW is UW, which corresponds to the second side of STV, which is TV. The third side of RUW is RW, which corresponds to the third side of STV, which is VS. So, that's consistent with the earlier analysis.

Therefore, the ratio between RUW and STV is 7/6. Therefore, the perimeter of RUW is 7/6 * perimeter of STV. So perimeter of STV is 24 + 18 + 12 = 54. Multiply by 7/6 gives 63. So answer A.

But wait, the problem says "the perimeter of triangle(R,U,W)" is to be found. But let me check again whether the given side UW is part of the triangle RUW. Yes, UW is one of its sides. So the given side is UW = 21, which corresponds to TV = 18 in triangle STV. So the ratio is 21/18 = 7/6. So the scaling factor is 7/6. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle RUW is 7/6 times the perimeter of triangle STV, which is 54. 54*(7/6) = 63. So answer A.

Alternatively, maybe I need to check if the given side is matching correctly. For instance, if the problem had said that a different side was given, like RW instead of UW, then the calculation would differ. But here, since UW is given as 21, which corresponds to TV=18, so that's correct.

Another way to check: Let's compute all sides of triangle RUW. Since the ratio is 7/6, then:

- RU corresponds to ST=24. So RU = 24*(7/6) = 28
- UW corresponds to TV=18, so UW=21 (given)
- RW corresponds to VS=12, so RW=12*(7/6)=14

Then the perimeter would be 28 + 21 + 14 = 63. Yep, same result. So that confirms that the perimeter is indeed 63. So answer A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the perimeter of $\triangle RUW$, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the given triangles and their corresponding sides.

### **Step 1: Understand the Similarity Relationship**

We're told that:

$$
\triangle RUW \sim \triangle STV
$$

This implies that the corresponding angles are congruent, and the corresponding sides are in proportion. The order of the vertices tells us which sides correspond:

- $RU$ corresponds to $ST$
- $UW$ corresponds to $TV$
- $RW$ corresponds to $VS$

---

### **Step 2: Extract Given Values**

From the problem:

- $ST = 24$
- $VS = 12$
- $VT = 18$
- $UW = 21$

Note that $VT$ is the same segment as $TV$, so:

$$
TV = 18
$$

Also, note that $UW = 21$ is a known side of $\triangle RUW$, and it corresponds to $TV = 18$ in $\triangle STV$.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Similarity**

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Using the known sides $UW$ and $TV$, we compute:

$$
\text{Similarity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Side of } \triangle RUW}{\text{Corresponding Side of } \triangle STV} = \frac{21}{18} = \frac{7}{6}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find the Perimeter of $\triangle STV$**

Using the given side lengths of $\triangle STV$:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle STV = ST + TV + VS = 24 + 18 + 12 = 54
$$

---

### **Step 5: Scale the Perimeter Using the Ratio**

Since the similarity ratio is $\frac{7}{6}$, the perimeter of $\triangle RUW$ will also scale by this factor:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle RUW = \frac{7}{6} \times 54 = 63
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

By identifying the corresponding sides, computing the similarity ratio, and scaling the perimeter accordingly, we find that the perimeter of $\triangle RUW$ is:

$$
\boxed{63}
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
$\boxed{A}$
