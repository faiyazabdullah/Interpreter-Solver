====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that angle 1 is 123 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 14. But wait, there are no figures provided here. Hmm, that's tricky. Without seeing the diagram, I have to assume some standard configuration based on common problems involving multiple angles. 

Since there are angles labeled 1 through 14, maybe it's a complex figure with intersecting lines, triangles, parallel lines, transversals, or something like that. Let me think about typical scenarios where multiple angles are involved. Maybe there are parallel lines cut by a transversal? Or perhaps there's a triangle with several angles?

Wait, another possibility: sometimes these problems involve supplementary or complementary angles. For example, if two angles form a linear pair, they add up to 180 degrees. Also, vertical angles are equal. If there are intersecting lines, vertical angles could be involved. Alternatively, if there are triangles, the sum of angles is 180 degrees.

But without knowing the exact relationships between the angles, this is challenging. However, since angle 1 is given as 123°, which is obtuse, maybe angle 14 is related through some property. Let me consider possible configurations.

Let me try assuming that angle 1 and angle 14 are vertical angles. If they are vertical angles, then they would be equal. So angle 14 would also be 123°, making the answer D. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, but maybe angle 1 and angle 14 are supplementary? Then 180 - 123 = 57°, so answer B. Or maybe they are part of a triangle?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is part of a triangle where other angles relate to angle 14. Suppose angle 1 is an exterior angle. In that case, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But again, without knowing how many sides or lines are involved, it's hard to tell.

Another thought: maybe there are parallel lines with transversals creating corresponding or alternate interior angles. Let's say angle 1 is a corresponding angle to another angle, which might be angle 14. If they are corresponding, they'd be equal. But again, unless the diagram shows specific relations, it's guesswork.

Wait, maybe angle 1 is part of a polygon. For example, if there's a pentagon or hexagon with various angles. But without more info, that's too vague.

Alternatively, think of consecutive angles in a parallelogram. Opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary. If angle 1 is 123°, then adjacent angles would be 180-123=57°. If angle 14 is adjacent, then it's 57°, which would be option B. But again, depends on their positions.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is in a triangle with angle 14 being an external angle. For instance, if angle 1 is an external angle, then it equals the sum of the two opposite internal angles. If angle 14 is one of those internal angles, then maybe... but without knowing the setup, it's unclear.

Wait, considering that there are 14 angles mentioned, maybe it's a star-shaped figure or a complex polygon with multiple intersections. For example, in a star polygon, each intersection creates different angles. But again, without specifics, it's hard.

Alternatively, think of a series of intersecting lines creating multiple angles. For example, if two lines cross, forming vertical angles. Then, if there are more lines added, creating more angles. Suppose angle 1 is vertical to another angle, which is supplementary to angle 14.

But since angle 1 is 123°, its vertical angle would also be 123°, but maybe angle 14 is adjacent to it. So if angle 1 is 123°, and it forms a straight line with angle 14, then angle 14 would be 180 - 123 = 57°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 14 are both in a triangle. Wait, but triangles only have three angles. Unless there are multiple triangles connected.

Hmm. Since the problem gives angles numbered 1 through 14, maybe it's a diagram with several intersecting lines, creating multiple angles. For example, imagine two transversals crossing multiple lines, leading to multiple angles. 

Let me try another approach. Maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or that angles in a triangle sum to 180°, etc.

Suppose angle 1 is at an intersection where several lines meet. If angle 1 is 123°, then adjacent angles could be found using supplementary angles (if they are linear pairs). For example, if angle 1 is formed by two lines crossing, creating four angles. Then, angle 1 and its vertical angle are equal, and the adjacent angles are supplementary. But without knowing the position of angle 14 relative to angle 1, it's still ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps angle numbers correspond to positions in a specific diagram. For example, in some standard diagrams, angles are labeled sequentially. For example, in a diagram with two parallel lines cut by a transversal, you get eight angles. But here there are 14 angles, so maybe multiple transversals or more complex intersections.

Alternatively, think of a triangle with a line drawn from one vertex to another, creating smaller triangles. For instance, in a triangle ABC, drawing a line from A to D on BC, creating angles. But again, without the diagram, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pentagon or hexagon with diagonals drawn, creating various angles. However, without knowing the exact structure, it's difficult.

Given that the answer choices are 47, 57, 67, or 123. Since angle 1 is 123°, which is obtuse. If angle 14 is its supplement, then 180 - 123 = 57°, which is option B. Another possibility is that angle 14 is an alternate interior angle or corresponding angle, but if angle 1 is 123°, then angle 14 would also be 123°, making answer D. However, if angle 14 is an exterior angle, then maybe it's equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps angle 1 is an exterior angle for a triangle, making it equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. If angle 14 is one of those remote angles, then angle 14 could be (sum) minus another angle. But again, without knowing the other angles, can't calculate.

Alternatively, suppose angle 1 and angle 14 are vertical angles. Then they are equal, so answer D. But why would angle 14 be vertical to angle 1? It depends on the diagram.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 14 are supplementary. So 180 - 123 = 57°, answer B.

Since the answer choices include 57°, which is 180-123, and 123 itself, maybe the answer is either B or D. Which is more likely?

If the question involves a straight line, then supplementary. If they are vertical angles, same measure. But without knowing, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, given that angle 1 is given as 123°, which is not a right angle, so if it's part of a straight line, then angle 14 would be supplementary. That makes sense. So 57° would be the answer. Hence, answer B.

But I'm not sure. However, since the user hasn't provided the diagram, I have to make assumptions. Common problems often use supplementary angles when angles are on a straight line. Therefore, I'll go with answer B: 57°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 14$, we start by analyzing the given information:

- We are told that $m\angle 1 = 123^\circ$.
- There are 14 labeled angles, suggesting a potentially complex geometric configuration involving intersecting lines, parallel lines, or polygons.

### Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Angles

Without the actual diagram, we rely on **common geometric principles** such as:

- **Vertical angles**: These are always equal.
- **Supplementary angles**: Two angles that form a straight line (i.e., lie on a straight line) sum to $180^\circ$.
- **Corresponding or alternate interior angles**: When dealing with parallel lines and transversals, these types of angles are congruent.
- **Triangle angle sum**: The sum of the angles inside any triangle is always $180^\circ$.

Since only one angle value is given ($123^\circ$), we infer that the relationship between $\angle 1$ and $\angle 14$ is most likely **supplementary**, meaning they form a linear pair along a straight line. This is a common scenario in problems with intersecting lines or transversals.

### Step 2: Applying the Supplementary Angle Property

If $\angle 1$ and $\angle 14$ are supplementary, then:

$$
m\angle 1 + m\angle 14 = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known value:

$$
123^\circ + m\angle 14 = 180^\circ
$$

Solving for $m\angle 14$:

$$
m\angle 14 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

Based on the assumption that $\angle 1$ and $\angle 14$ are supplementary (a reasonable interpretation in the absence of a diagram), the measure of $\angle 14$ is:

$$
\boxed{57}
$$
