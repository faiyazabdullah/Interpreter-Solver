MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this rhombus problem. So, we have a rhombus ABCD. The question says that the measure of angle DAB is 2, which seems really small. Wait, angles in a rhombus... Hmm, maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps it's in degrees? Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe it's supposed to be 2 times something? No, the original problem states m∠DAB = 2, but that might not make sense because in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. If one angle is 2 degrees, then the opposite angle would also be 2 degrees, and the other two angles would be 178 degrees each. But that seems extremely small. Maybe I misread the question?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: It says "m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6." Wait, that part is confusing. Let me parse that again. The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
...
Angle(A,D,B)
Angle(A,D,C)
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(D,A,B)
Angle(D,C,B)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B) IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,B) IsDiagonalOf(Line(C,D) IsVertexOf(A, Rhombus(A,B,C,D) ... etc."

But then in the QUESTION section:

"In rhombus A B C D, m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m ∠ADB."

Wait, maybe there was a formatting error. Let me re-express the question properly. The question says: In rh/ombus ABCD, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m∠ADB.

Hmm, that still doesn't parse correctly. Maybe it's supposed to say m∠DAB = 2°, and CB (which is a side?) has length 6? Because CB is a side of the rhombus. Since in a rhombus all sides are equal. Wait, but if CB is a side, then all sides are 6. Then, how does that relate to the angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and they meant m∠ADC = 6? Or maybe m∠ADC = 6 and CB = 6? But CB is a side, so if CB is 6, then all sides are 6. But then the angle measures... Let me think again.

Assuming that the problem says: In rhombus ABCD, the measure of angle DAB is 2 degrees, and the length of CB is 6 units. Wait, but CB is a side of the rhombus, so all sides are 6. But then angle DAB being 2 degrees is very small. However, maybe the angle is 2 radians? That could be possible, but usually angles in problems like this are in degrees unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the angle measure and something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a formatting issue, and the actual question is: In rhombus ABCD, m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6. But that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had m∠DAB = 2°, and another angle or something else is 6. 

Wait, given the way the problem is written, perhaps there was a mistake in the input. For example, maybe the original problem said that angle DAB is 2 times some value, and another angle is 6. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the answer choices are numerical values (like 30, 60, etc.), it's likely that the angle measures are in degrees and the numbers are integers.

Let me try to proceed assuming that there might be a typo, and perhaps the angle measures are different. For example, maybe the original problem intended m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = something else, but that's pure guesswork. Alternatively, maybe the problem says that angle DAB is 2 times angle ADC or something similar. But without clear info, this is challenging.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the structure of the problem. Given that ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are equal. Let me recall that in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect the angles. Additionally, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

The question asks for m∠ADB. Let me visualize the rhombus ABCD. Let me draw it mentally. Let me label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. But according to the given constraints, there is a point E which is the intersection of lines AD and CB? Wait, no. Wait, in the given constraints, IsIntersectionOf(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)) gives Point(E). So, line AD and line CB intersect at point E. Wait, but in a rhombus, lines AD and CB are adjacent sides? Wait, no. Let me clarify the structure.

In a rhombus ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, line AD connects points A and D. Line CB connects points C and B. These two lines are not necessarily parallel or intersecting unless extended. Wait, in a rhombus, opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Therefore, lines AD and BC are not parallel; they are actually adjacent sides? Wait, AD is one side, BC is another side. Wait, in a rhombus, consecutive sides are connected. So, AD is connected to DC and AB. Wait, perhaps I need to sketch coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the rhombus to make it easier. Suppose we place point A at (0,0). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me assume AB is along the x-axis. Let me denote vectors. But maybe using coordinate geometry can help.

Alternatively, consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, they bisect each other and are perpendicular only in a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. Yes, that's a property. They bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles.

So, if I can find the relationship between the angles and the sides, maybe I can use trigonometry.

But going back to the problem. The question says m∠DAB = 2, which I'm assuming is degrees. Wait, if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ABC is 180-2=178 degrees, angle BCD is 2 degrees, and angle ADC is 178 degrees. But then, if that's the case, then looking at triangle ADB. Wait, angle ADB is part of triangle ADB. Let me think about that.

Wait, point E is the intersection of AD and CB? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states: IsIntersectionOf(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)) gives Point(E). So, line AD and line CB intersect at point E. But in a rhombus, line AD is one side, and line CB is another side. Are these lines intersecting? In a standard rhombus, sides AD and CB are not intersecting because they are opposite sides. Wait, unless extended. Wait, if you extend them, they would meet at some point. Wait, but in a rhombus, sides AD and BC are opposite sides, so they are parallel. Therefore, lines AD and BC are parallel, so they never meet. Hence, their intersection point E would be at infinity, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem. Perhaps it's supposed to be lines AB and CD? Or lines AC and BD, which are the diagonals? Because in that case, their intersection is the center of the rhombus. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to lines AB and CD? Or lines AB and DC? Wait, but the given constraint mentions IsIntersectionOf(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)), which are sides AD and CB. Which are parallel, hence don't intersect. So this suggests either a mistake in the problem setup or a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to segments rather than lines. If so, then segment AD and segment CB do not intersect, as they are opposite sides. Hence, this seems contradictory. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's description.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant to refer to diagonals instead of lines. For example, if it were diagonal AC and diagonal BD, their intersection is point E. But in the given constraints, it's Line(A,D) and Line(C,B). Unless AD and CB are considered as diagonals? Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. AD is a side, not a diagonal. So unless there's confusion between sides and diagonals.

Given that, perhaps there's an error in the problem's wording. Assuming that there's a mistake and that the intersection point E is where the diagonals intersect, i.e., lines AC and BD intersect at E. If that's the case, then we can work with that. But since the problem explicitly says Line(A,D) and Line(C,B), which are sides, leading to inconsistency.

This suggests that there may be errors in the problem's constraints, making it unsolvable as stated. However, since the user expects us to proceed, perhaps we need to reinterpret the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that point E is the intersection of the diagonals. Let me assume that. Let me suppose that the problem has a typo and that IsIntersectionOf(Line(A,C), Line(B,D)) gives Point(E). This makes sense as diagonals intersect at E. With that assumption, let's proceed.

Now, the question is to find m∠ADB. Let's note that angle ADB is the angle at point D between points A, D, and B. Wait, angle ADB would be at point D, formed by points A-D-B. Wait, but in a rhombus, points A, D, B: point D is connected to A and C, and point B is connected to C and A. So, angle ADB is the angle at D between AD and DB. Wait, but DB is a diagonal from D to B. So, yes, angle ADB is formed by side AD and diagonal DB.

To find this angle, we can use properties of rhombuses. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, if we know one of the angles of the rhombus, we can find the angles created by the diagonals.

Let me denote the given information. The problem states that m∠DAB = 2 degrees. Wait, if that's the case, then angle DAB is 2 degrees. But in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle ABC = 180 - 2 = 178 degrees. Similarly, angle BCD = 2 degrees, angle ADC = 178 degrees.

Now, the diagonals bisect these angles. So, diagonal DB divides angle ADC into two equal parts. Wait, angle ADC is 178 degrees, so each half is 89 degrees. But wait, angle ADC is at point D, between points A, D, C. The diagonal from D to B would split angle ADC into two angles. Wait, no: the diagonals bisect the angles at the vertices. So, diagonal DB would bisect angle ADC and angle ABC. Wait, no: each diagonal bisects two opposite angles. Diagonal AC bisects angles at A and C, while diagonal BD bisects angles at B and D.

Wait, let me confirm. In a rhombus, each diagonal splits the angles at the vertices it connects. For instance, diagonal AC connects vertices A and C, so it bisects angles at A and C. Diagonal BD connects vertices B and D, so it bisects angles at B and D.

Therefore, angle ADB is half of angle ADC? No. Wait, angle ADC is at point D. The diagonal from D to B would split angle ADC into two angles. Wait, angle ADC is the angle at D between points A, D, C. The diagonal BD goes from D to B. So, it splits angle ADC into two angles: angle ADB and angle CDB. Since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, each of those angles would be half of angle ADC.

Wait, angle ADC is 178 degrees, so each of those halves would be 89 degrees. Therefore, angle ADB is 89 degrees? But that's not among the answer choices. The answer choices are 30, 60, 90, 120. So, this suggests that my assumption that m∠DAB is 2 degrees is incorrect. There must be a misinterpretation of the problem.

Wait, maybe the original problem had m∠DAB = 60 degrees, and there was a typo. Or perhaps the problem says that angle DAB is 2 times some value, and another angle is 6. Let me go back to the original problem statement.

Original problem says: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m ∠ADB."

Ah! Wait, maybe it's m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6? Or perhaps the problem says that m∠DAB = 2, and m∠ADC = 6? Or that CB = 6? Let me parse the sentence again carefully.

It says: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m ∠ADB."

This is ambiguous. It might mean that m∠DAB = 2, and m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6. Or it could mean that m∠DAB = 2 and m∠ADC and CB = 6, which is unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error or formatting issue.

If we assume that it's m∠DAB = 2°, m∠ADC = 6°, and CB = 6 units, then we can proceed. But in that case, the sum of angles in a quadrilateral would be 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 16 degrees, which is impossible since the total should be 360. Hence, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe it's m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6. Then, since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary, so angle DAB + angle ADC = 180 degrees. So, 2x + 6 = 180 => 2x = 174 => x = 87. Then, angle DAB = 2*87 = 174°, which still doesn't seem helpful. And then finding angle ADB...

Alternatively, maybe it's a mistranslation, and the original problem said that m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = 2°, or something like that. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, given the answer choices include 90 and 60, which are common angles in rhombus problems. Let me try to think differently. Assume that there is a typo, and the question meant that m∠DAB = 60°, and CB = 6. Since CB is a side, all sides are 6. Then, in a rhombus with one angle 60°, the diagonals can be calculated.

For example, if angle DAB is 60°, then the diagonals divide the angles. The diagonals of a rhombus satisfy the relations:

d1 = 2 * a * sin(theta/2)

d2 = 2 * a * cos(theta/2)

Where theta is one of the angles, and a is the side length.

Wait, actually, the lengths of the diagonals can be found using the formula:

If d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then:

d1 = 2a * sin(theta/2)

d2 = 2a * cos(theta/2)

Wait, no. Let me derive it.

Consider a rhombus with side length a and one angle θ. The diagonals split the rhombus into four right triangles. Each half of the diagonals forms legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse a. Let me denote the diagonals as p and q. Then:

p = 2a * sin(theta/2)

q = 2a * cos(theta/2)

Wait, actually, the formula is derived from splitting the rhombus into triangles. For example, if angle at A is θ, then the diagonals split it into two angles of θ/2. Using the law of cosines on the triangle formed by two sides and a diagonal:

For diagonal connecting A and C, which splits the angle θ. The length of diagonal AC can be found using the law of cosines:

AC² = a² + a² - 2*a*a*cosθ = 2a²(1 - cosθ)

Similarly, the other diagonal BD, which splits the angle at B (which is 180 - θ), so its length squared is:

BD² = 2a²(1 - cos(180 - θ)) = 2a²(1 + cosθ)

Thus, the lengths of the diagonals are:

AC = sqrt(2a²(1 - cosθ)) = 2a*sin(θ/2)

BD = sqrt(2a²(1 + cosθ)) = 2a*cos(θ/2)

Yes, because 1 - cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2), and 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2).

So, if angle DAB is θ, then the diagonals are 2a*sin(θ/2) and 2a*cos(θ/2).

Now, returning to the problem. If we assume that angle DAB is 60°, then θ = 60°, and the diagonals would be:

AC = 2a*sin(30°) = 2a*(1/2) = a

BD = 2a*cos(30°) = 2a*(√3/2) = a√3

Now, the diagonals intersect at point E, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. Now, to find angle ADB. Let me think about triangle ADB. Points A, D, B. Wait, angle at D, between A and B. Let me see.

Alternatively, angle ADB is part of triangle ADB. Let me consider triangle ADB. In this triangle, we have sides AD = a, DB = a√3 (since BD is the longer diagonal), and AB = a.

Wait, but in triangle ADB, sides are AD = a, DB = a√3, and AB = a. Wait, but that would make triangle ADB with sides a, a, and a√3. Wait, but that's not possible because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Here, a + a > a√3? Let's check: 2a > a√3 → 2 > √3 ≈ 1.732, which is true. So it's valid.

But what is angle at D in triangle ADB? Using the Law of Cosines:

AB² = AD² + DB² - 2*AD*DB*cos(angle ADB)

Wait, AB is the side of the rhombus, which is a. AD is a, DB is a√3.

So,

a² = a² + (a√3)^2 - 2*a*(a√3)*cos(angle ADB)

Calculate:

Left side: a²

Right side: a² + 3a² - 2*a^2*√3*cos(angle ADB) = 4a² - 2√3 a² cos(angle ADB)

Set equal:

a² = 4a² - 2√3 a² cos(angle ADB)

Subtract 4a²:

-3a² = -2√3 a² cos(angle ADB)

Divide both sides by -a²:

3 = 2√3 cos(angle ADB)

Then:

cos(angle ADB) = 3 / (2√3) = √3 / 2

Which means angle ADB is 30 degrees.

So, if angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADB is 30°, which corresponds to option A. But the original problem states that m∠DAB = 2, which seems inconsistent. However, if there was a typo and the actual angle DAB is 60°, then the answer would be A. But the problem says 2. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 2 radians, which is approximately 114.59 degrees, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that angle DAB is 2 times some value, and another angle is 6. Let me try another approach.

Suppose that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = 6x, and CB = 6. Since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary, so ∠DAB + ∠ADC = 180°. Thus, 2x + 6x = 180 → 8x = 180 → x = 22.5°. Then, ∠DAB = 45°, ∠ADC = 135°. Then, angle ADB is half of ∠ADC (since diagonal BD bisects ∠ADC). So, angle ADB = 135° / 2 = 67.5°, which isn't among the choices.

Alternatively, if CB = 6, which is the side length, and angle DAB is 2x, and angle ADC is 6x. But this seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says that m∠DAB = 2°, and the length of CB is 6. But then, how does that relate to the angle? Let me try to calculate angle ADB in terms of angle DAB.

Let me denote angle DAB as α = 2°, and since it's a rhombus, angle ADC = 180° - α = 178°. The diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, so angle ADB = angle ADC / 2 = 178° / 2 = 89°, which is close to 90°, but not exact. The closest answer choice is C. 90°. But this assumes that the angle is measured in degrees, and there's a rounding.

However, given that the answer choices are discrete, and 89° is very close to 90°, maybe the intended answer is C. But this depends on whether the original problem had a typo, such as angle DAB = 2°, and expecting 90° as an approximate answer. But this feels forced.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that m∠DAB = 60°, and CB = 6, leading to angle ADB = 30°, which is option A. But why would the problem mention CB = 6? Because if CB is a side, then all sides are 6, but in that case, the calculation above shows that angle ADB is 30°, which matches option A.

Given that, even though the original problem states m∠DAB = 2, which seems odd, but if it's a typo and should be 60°, then the answer is A. Alternatively, if it's a different scenario.

Another possibility: Maybe the problem says that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = 6, and CB = 6. Then, since adjacent angles are supplementary: 2x + 6 = 180 → x = 87, so angle DAB = 174°, and angle ADC = 6°. Then, angle ADB is half of angle ADC = 3°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if the problem says that m∠DAB = 2, and m∠ADC = 6, then the sum would be 2 + 6 = 8, and the other two angles would be 172° each, but this doesn't add up to 360°.

At this point, considering the ambiguity in the problem statement, and the fact that the answer choices include 30, 60, 90, 120, and the most plausible scenario when assuming angle DAB is 60°, leading to angle ADB = 30°, I think the intended answer is A. Alternatively, if there's a different interpretation.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, if we can find the relationship between the diagonals and the sides, and use the given CB = 6 (side length), and angle DAB = 2 (probably degrees), then compute angle ADB.

But if angle DAB is 2°, then the diagonals are:

Let me denote side length as s = CB = 6.

Using the earlier formulas:

Diagonals:

AC = 2s * sin(α/2) = 2*6*sin(1°)

BD = 2s * cos(α/2) = 2*6*cos(1°)

Now, angle ADB is half of angle ADC, which is 180° - α = 178°, so angle ADB = 89°, as before. This is very close to 90°, and if rounded, would be option C.

But if the problem allows for approximation, then the answer would be C. However, this requires assuming that the angle was mistyped, and the actual angle is 1 degree, leading to 89°, or that the problem expects an approximate answer.

Alternatively, if there was a mistake in the problem, and the angle DAB is 60°, leading to angle ADB = 30°, which is option A.

Since both scenarios are possible, but given that the answer choices include 30 and 90, and the problem mentions CB = 6, which is a side length, and if angle DAB is 60°, then the answer is 30°, which is option A. However, if angle DAB is 2°, then the answer is approximately 90°, option C.

But without further clarification, it's hard to decide. However, given that 30° and 90° are both present, and considering common rhombus problems, I think the intended answer is likely A or C. To determine which, let's think about typical problems.

In many geometry problems, especially standardized tests, angles are often in whole numbers, and if an angle is very small, it's sometimes due to a typo. For example, if the angle was supposed to be 60°, leading to a clean answer. Alternatively, if the angle is 2 radians (approximately 114.59°), but that's less likely.

Another thought: If angle DAB is 2 radians (≈114.59°), then angle ADC is π - 2 radians ≈ 1.1416 radians (≈65.5°). Then, angle ADB is half of angle ADC ≈ 32.75°, which is closest to 30°, option A. But again, this is speculative.

Given the uncertainty, but needing to choose, I'll go with the scenario where angle DAB is 60°, leading to angle ADB = 30°, option A. Hence, Final Answer: A.
