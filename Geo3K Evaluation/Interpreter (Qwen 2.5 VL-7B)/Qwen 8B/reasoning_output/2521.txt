MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have an equilateral triangle RST. That means all the sides are equal, right? Wait, but the question gives different expressions for each side: RS is x + 9, ST is 2x, and RT is 3x - 9. But since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides should be equal. So I need to set these expressions equal to each other and solve for x.

Let me write that down. Since RS = ST = RT, then:

First, set RS equal to ST: x + 9 = 2x. Solving that would give me 9 = x. Let me check that. If x is 9, then RS would be 9 + 9 = 18, ST would be 2*9=18, so that works. Then RT would be 3x - 9, which would be 3*9 -9 = 27 -9 = 18. Oh, so all three sides are 18 when x is 9. So that seems like x=9. But wait, let me make sure there isn't another equation that could conflict here.

Alternatively, maybe I should also check another pair of sides. For example, setting ST equal to RT: 2x = 3x -9. Solving that would subtract 2x from both sides: 0 = x -9, so x=9 again. Same result. And then checking RS equals RT: x+9 = 3x -9. Subtract x from both sides: 9 = 2x -9. Add 9 to both sides: 18=2x, so x=9. All equations lead to x=9. Therefore, the answer should be option C, which is 9. 

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 9. So that seems straightforward. However, sometimes problems might have tricks. Let me double-check my work. 

If x=9, then RS is x+9=18, ST is 2x=18, RT is 3x-9=18. All sides equal, so yes, it's an equilateral triangle. So x=9. The answer must be C. 

Wait, but why does the problem mention Line(R,S), Line(S,T), etc.? Are they just indicating the sides? Yes, because in an equilateral triangle all sides are equal. So the key was recognizing that all sides must be equal, leading to the equations. So solving those equations gives x=9. Hence, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ in the context of an **equilateral triangle** $ \triangle RST $, we start by analyzing the given side lengths expressed algebraically:

- $ RS = x + 9 $
- $ ST = 2x $
- $ RT = 3x - 9 $

---

### Step 1: Use the property of an equilateral triangle  
In an **equilateral triangle**, **all three sides are equal**. Thus, we can equate the given expressions for the sides:

$$
RS = ST = RT
$$

This leads us to form the following system of equations:

1. $ x + 9 = 2x $
2. $ 2x = 3x - 9 $
3. $ x + 9 = 3x - 9 $

---

### Step 2: Solve the first equation  
From (1):  
$$
x + 9 = 2x \\
\Rightarrow 9 = x
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify consistency using the second equation  
From (2):  
$$
2x = 3x - 9 \\
\Rightarrow 9 = x
$$

Again, consistent result.

---

### Step 4: Confirm using the third equation  
From (3):  
$$
x + 9 = 3x - 9 \\
\Rightarrow 18 = 2x \\
\Rightarrow x = 9
$$

All equations yield the same solution: $ x = 9 $

---

### Step 5: Final Check  
Plug $ x = 9 $ into the original expressions:

- $ RS = x + 9 = 9 + 9 = 18 $
- $ ST = 2x = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 $
- $ RT = 3x - 9 = 3 \cdot 9 - 9 = 27 - 9 = 18 $

All sides are equal, confirming that the triangle is indeed equilateral.

---

### Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{C}
$$
