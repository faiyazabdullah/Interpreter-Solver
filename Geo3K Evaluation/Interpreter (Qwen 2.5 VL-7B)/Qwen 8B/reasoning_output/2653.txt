QUESTION:
Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 6 if m \angle 1 = 30.

CHOICES:
A. 30
B. 45
C. 60
D. 90

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 6 given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. The quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. First, I need to recall the properties of rectangles. 

In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle should be 90 degrees. Wait, but there are mentions of various angles labeled 1 through 12 here. Maybe some of these angles aren't the standard ones? Let me parse the given information again.

The problem states several perpendicular lines and equal lengths. It also lists multiple angles, with Angle(6) being a right angle (as per RightAngle(Angle(6)), so angle 6 is 90 degrees. But wait, the question asks for angle 6's measure when angle 1 is 30. That seems conflicting because angle 6 is supposed to be a right angle. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood something.

Wait, perhaps the labels for angles 1-12 refer to different angles within the rectangle. Let me think. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. However, maybe there are diagonals or other lines creating triangles inside the rectangle, leading to different angles?

Let me visualize the rectangle WXYZ. Let's assume points W, X, Y, Z arranged clockwise as a rectangle. So, sides WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals would be WY and XZ. When they mention angles like Angle(W,X,Y), that's the angle at point X between points W, X, Y. Which in a rectangle is 90 degrees. Similarly, other angles at vertices are right angles. But then why are there angles labeled 1 through 12? Maybe the angles mentioned in the problem include both the internal angles of the rectangle and angles formed by diagonals or other constructions?

Looking back at the constraints:

There are several Perpendicular statements. For example, Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y)) which makes sense since adjacent sides of a rectangle are perpendicular. Similarly for others. Also, Equal Lengths for sides. So, it's confirming that it's a rectangle.

Now, the angles listed: Angle(1) to Angle(12). The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)) and Supplementary(Angle(1), etc. Wait, the exact text says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(2)
Supplementary(Angle(3)
Supplementary(Angle(4)
Supplementary(Angle(5)
Supplementary(Angle(6)".

Wait, maybe the way this is written is that Angle(1) is supplementary to Angles 2-6? Or perhaps Angle(1) is equal to another angle, and supplementary to others? This part is confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem gives several constraints including:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Y))
... and so on, implying all sides are equal? Wait, no. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Wait, the list includes Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Y))? Wait, that can't be unless it's a square. Because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are not necessarily equal. But maybe there's more constraints here. Let me check again.

Original constraints:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Y)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Y,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,W)"

Wait, that seems like all sides are equal? Because Line(W,X) is one side, Line(W,Y) is diagonal? Wait, no. Wait, the rectangle has four sides: W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to W. So Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,W). Then, the other lines mentioned might be diagonals? Like Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z)? Wait, the problem says:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Angle(W,X,Y)
Angle(W,Y,Z)
Angle(X,Y,Z)
Angle(X,Z,W)
Angle(Y,Z,W)
Angle(Y,W,X)
Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(4)
Angle(5)
Angle(6)
Angle(7)
Angle(8)
Angle(9)
Angle(10)
Angle(11)
Angle(12)
RightAngle(Angle(6)
RightAngle(Angle(12)
..."

So, the angles mentioned are various angles formed by the points. For example, Angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between W-X-Y. Which in a rectangle is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(W,Y,Z) would be the angle at Y between W-Y-Z. But since W-Y is a diagonal, and Y-Z is a side. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the points are arranged as a rectangle. Let me sketch mentally:

Assume rectangle WXYZ with W at bottom-left, X at bottom-right, Y at top-right, Z at top-left. So, sides WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals are WY and XZ.

Then, Angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between W-X-Y. That's the corner angle of the rectangle, which is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(W,Y,Z) would be the angle at Y between W-Y-Z. But W-Y is a diagonal, and Y-Z is a side. So that angle would be between diagonal WY and side YZ. Let me compute that angle.

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to specific angles labeled 1 to 12. The problem says:

"Angle(1)
Angle(2)
Angle(3)
Angle(4)
Angle(5)
Angle(6)
Angle(7)
Angle(8)
Angle(9)
Angle(10)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Y,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,W)
Perpendicular(Line(W,X)
Line(W,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,W)
Perpendicular(Line(Z,X)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(2)
Supplementary(Angle(3)
Supplementary(Angle(4)
Supplementary(Angle(5)
Supplementary(Angle(6)

This is very dense. Let me try to parse each constraint.

First, the rectangle is defined with points W, X, Y, Z connected as per the lines. Then, angles are mentioned, including Angle(6) and Angle(12) being right angles. Also, Angle(1) is equal to some value, and it's supplementary to Angles 2-6. Wait, the line says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(2)
Supplementary(Angle(3)
Supplementary(Angle(4)
Supplementary(Angle(5)
Supplementary(Angle(6)"

Hmm, maybe that means MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals something, and Angle(1) is supplementary to Angles 2-6? Or perhaps that Angle(1) is equal to another angle, and supplementary to others. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using Angle(1) as a variable, and the relationships between angles are given via those supplementary conditions.

But the problem says "Find the measure of ∠6 if m∠1 = 30." So we need to find the measure of angle 6 given that angle 1 is 30 degrees.

Since angle 6 is specified as a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(6)), that would mean angle 6 measures 90 degrees. But then why is angle 1 given as 30? There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps angle 6 isn't a right angle? Wait, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(6)), so angle 6 is a right angle, which would make its measure 90 degrees regardless of other angles. But then why give angle 1 as 30? Unless there's a mistake in interpreting the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the labeling of angles is different. Perhaps angle 6 is not one of the standard right angles of the rectangle, but an angle formed by intersecting lines, such as a diagonal?

For instance, suppose we have a rectangle with diagonals drawn. The diagonals bisect each other and create triangles. If angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals, then maybe angle 1 is 30 degrees, and angle 6 relates to that.

Let me consider that scenario. Suppose the diagonals intersect at point O. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they don't necessarily form 30-degree angles unless the rectangle is a specific type, like a rhombus or something else.

Wait, but if angle 1 is 30 degrees, which could be an angle formed by a diagonal and a side. For example, if you draw a diagonal from W to Y, forming triangle WXY. In that case, angle at X between side WX and diagonal WY. Let me calculate that.

In a rectangle, if angle 1 is that angle, say, angle between side WX and diagonal WY. Let's denote the rectangle as having length l and width w. Then, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = w/l. If angle 1 is theta, then tan(theta) = w/l. But without knowing the ratio of sides, how can we determine theta?

However, if there are supplementary angles involved. For example, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then maybe some other angles relate to it.

But the problem states that Angle(1) is supplementary to Angles 2 through 6. So, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then each of the angles 2-6 would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees? But that seems odd, especially since angle 6 is said to be a right angle. That contradicts.

Wait, the problem says:

"Supplementary(Angle(1)
Supplementary(Angle(2)
Supplementary(Angle(3)
Supplementary(Angle(4)
Supplementary(Angle(5)
Supplementary(Angle(6)"

Does this mean that Angle(1) is supplementary to itself? No, that doesn't make sense. More likely, each of the angles listed (1-6) is supplementary to Angle(1)? Or that Angle(1) is supplementary to each of Angles 2-6?

If Angle(1) is supplementary to Angles 2-6, then each of those angles would be 180 - m∠1. Given that m∠1 = 30°, then Angles 2-6 would be 150°. But angle 6 is stated to be a right angle, which would imply 90°, contradicting this. Hence, this suggests that my interpretation is wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the given that angle 6 is a right angle, so m∠6 = 90°, regardless of other angles. But the question asks to find m∠6 given that m∠1 = 30°. That would suggest that m∠6 is 90°, making the answer D. But that feels too straightforward. Why give angle 1 as 30° if it's irrelevant?

Perhaps there's confusion in labeling angles. Maybe angle 6 refers to an angle that isn't a right angle, and the RightAngle(Angle(6)) is a mislabeling? Or perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement?

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a non-rectangle, but due to the constraints given, it turns out to be a rectangle. Wait, the first line says "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle," so it's confirmed to be a rectangle. Therefore, all angles in the rectangle are right angles. However, the presence of angles 1-12 may involve other angles created by intersecting lines or diagonals.

Let me consider that the angles 1-12 refer to angles formed by the diagonals. For example, in a rectangle, the diagonals divide it into two congruent triangles. If the diagonals intersect at point O, then the angles around O would be vertical angles. For instance, if the diagonals intersect at O, then angle between diagonal WY and diagonal XZ at O would create several angles. Suppose angle 1 is one of those angles, and angle 6 is another.

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but unless it's a square, they aren't perpendicular. So the angles formed at their intersection depend on the rectangle's aspect ratio.

Let’s suppose that angle 1 is one of the angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals. Let’s say angle 1 is θ, then the opposite angle would be θ, and the other two angles would be 180° - θ. But if angle 1 is given as 30°, then the other angles would be 150°, but angle 6 could be one of them. But the problem says angle 6 is a right angle, which conflicts unless θ=30° and 180-θ=150°, but none are 90°, so this can’t be.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to a different angle. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: Since the problem includes Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y)), which implies that side WX is perpendicular to side WY. Wait, but WY is a diagonal, not a side. So in a rectangle, side WX is horizontal, and diagonal WY goes from W to Y, which would make an angle with WX. If they're perpendicular, that would mean the diagonal is vertical, implying that the rectangle is actually a square. Because in a square, the diagonals are not perpendicular to the sides. Wait, no—wait, the diagonal of a square is not perpendicular to the sides; instead, it forms 45° angles with the sides. So if WX is horizontal, the diagonal WY would go from bottom-left to top-right, making a 45° angle if it's a square. But if it's a general rectangle, the diagonal makes an angle whose tangent is height/width.

But the problem says Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y)). That would mean that the diagonal WY is perpendicular to side WX. That only occurs if the rectangle is degenerate, i.e., a line segment, which is impossible. Hence, there's inconsistency here. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps misinterpretation of the constraints.

Wait, looking back at the original constraints:

"Perpendicular(Line(W,X)
Line(W,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,W)
Perpendicular(Line(Z,X)
"

Ah! Wait, the Perpendicular statements are between certain pairs of lines. Let me re-express them:

- Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y)): This implies that the line WX is perpendicular to line WY. But line WY is a diagonal from W to Y. In a rectangle, this would require that the diagonal WX is perpendicular to the diagonal WY. But that's only possible if the rectangle is a square? No, even in a square, the diagonals are not perpendicular to each other—they intersect at 90 degrees. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes! In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. So if this rectangle is actually a square, then the diagonals are perpendicular. But the problem states it's a rectangle, not necessarily a square. However, if the constraints include that the diagonals are perpendicular, then it must be a square. But the problem says it's a rectangle, so maybe it's a square?

Wait, let's see. The problem says "Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)", so it's a rectangle, but additional constraints include that certain lines are perpendicular. For example, Line(W,X) and Line(W,Y) are perpendicular. If Line(W,X) is a side and Line(W,Y) is a diagonal, then for them to be perpendicular, the diagonal must be perpendicular to the side. This can only happen if the rectangle is a square, because in a square, the diagonal forms 45° with the sides, but that's not perpendicular. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, if Line(W,X) is horizontal, and Line(W,Y) is a diagonal going from W to Y. For these two lines to be perpendicular, the slope of WX times the slope of WY must be -1.

Assuming W is at origin (0,0), X is at (a,0), Y is at (a,b), Z is at (0,b). Then line WX is horizontal, from (0,0) to (a,0). Line WY goes from (0,0) to (a,b). The slope of WX is 0 (horizontal), the slope of WY is b/a. For them to be perpendicular, the product of slopes must be -1. So 0 * (b/a) = 0 ≠ -1. Contradiction. Thus, it's impossible for Line(W,X) and Line(W,Y) to be perpendicular unless b approaches infinity, which isn't valid. Hence, there's a contradiction in the constraints, suggesting that either the problem has an error, or I'm misinterpreting the Perpendicular statements.

Wait, perhaps the Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y)) is a mistake, and it should be Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(X,Y))? Because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. That would make sense. Let me check the original constraints again.

Looking back: 

"Perpendicular(Line(W,X)
Line(W,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Y)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(X,Z)
Perpendicular(Line(Y,W)
Perpendicular(Line(Z,X)
"

It seems like each pair of adjacent sides are perpendicular. For example, Line(W,X) and Line(X,Y) are perpendicular, which is true for a rectangle. Similarly, Line(X,Y) and Line(Y,Z), etc. But the initial entry says Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(W,Y))? That would be incorrect, as Line(W,X) is a side, and Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. So that must be a mistake in the problem statement. Assuming that's a typo, and the intended was Perpendicular(Line(W,X), Line(X,Y)), which is correct. 

Given that, assuming that the Perpendicular statements are about adjacent sides, which makes sense for a rectangle. Then, the rest of the constraints include that all sides are equal in length? Wait, the Equals(LengthOf(...) statements:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Y)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Y,Z)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,W)"

Wait, Line(W,Y) is a diagonal, not a side. If all these lengths are equal, that would mean that all sides and diagonals are equal. That would only be possible if the rectangle is a square. Because in a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal to sqrt(2)*side. So if the sides are equal to the diagonals, then sqrt(2)*s = s → sqrt(2)=1, which is false. Hence, contradiction again. So this suggests that the problem has inconsistencies, possibly due to errors in transcription.

But given that the problem says it's a rectangle, and asks for angle 6, which is a right angle, and angle 1 is 30°, perhaps despite the contradictions, we should proceed under the assumption that it's a rectangle with some special properties.

Alternatively, maybe the angles labeled 1-12 are not the usual angles of the rectangle but angles formed by the diagonals. For instance, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals. Let's consider that.

In a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Let's say they intersect at O. The diagonals divide each other into two equal parts. The angles formed at the intersection depend on the rectangle's aspect ratio. Let's assume that angle 1 is one of those angles at the intersection. For example, if the diagonals intersect at O, forming four angles: two acute and two obtuse. If angle 1 is acute, then it's supplementary to the obtuse angles.

If m∠1 = 30°, then the opposite angle is also 30°, and the other two angles are 180° - 30° = 150°. Now, if angle 6 is one of those angles, depending on which one it is. But the problem states that angle 6 is a right angle, which would mean 90°, but according to this, it's either 30° or 150°, which doesn't align. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to one of the angles of the rectangle itself. Since all angles in a rectangle are 90°, then angle 6 would be 90°, making the answer D. But why is angle 1 given as 30°? It might be a red herring, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the labeling.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a different configuration. Let's consider that angle 1 is not an angle of the rectangle but an angle formed by extending sides or something else.

Alternatively, since the problem includes multiple angles, perhaps angle 1 is an angle in one of the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, if we have triangle WXY, which is a right triangle (since WXYZ is a rectangle). In this triangle, angle at X is 90°, angle at W is angle between WX and WY. Let's call this angle 1. If angle 1 is 30°, then the other angles in the triangle would be 60°, because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So angle at Y would be 60°. But how does this relate to angle 6?

If angle 6 is another angle in the diagram, perhaps related to this triangle. But without knowing where angle 6 is located, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the diagonal, like the angle between diagonal WY and side YZ. In this case, in triangle WYZ, which is also a right triangle. If we know angle at Y, which is 90°, and angle at W is some value.

Wait, let's get concrete. Assume WXYZ is a rectangle with sides WX = a, XY = b. Diagonal WY divides the rectangle into two right triangles. In triangle WXY, angle at X is 90°, angle at W is angle between side WX and diagonal WY. Let's call this angle α. Then, tan(α) = opposite/adjacent = XY / WX = b/a. So α = arctan(b/a). Similarly, angle at Y in triangle WXY is 90° - α.

If angle 1 is α, and it's given as 30°, then arctan(b/a) = 30°, so b/a = tan(30°) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. Thus, the rectangle has width a and height b = a/√3.

Now, what is angle 6? If angle 6 is the angle at Y between diagonal WY and side YZ. Let's look at triangle YZW. At point Y, the angle between YZ and YW. Since YZ is a side of length a (assuming YZ is same as WX, which is a), and YW is the diagonal. Let's compute this angle.

In triangle YZW, angle at Y is between YZ (length a) and YW (diagonal length sqrt(a² + b²)). Using trigonometry, this angle would be similar to angle α in triangle WXY. Let's calculate it.

In triangle YZW, the angle at Y is between side YZ (length a) and diagonal YW (length sqrt(a² + b²)). The angle can be found using tan(angle) = opposite/adjacent = WX / YZ = a/b. Wait, no. Let me think.

Actually, in triangle YZW, the angle at Y is between YZ (which is vertical, assuming Y is top-right) and diagonal YW (from Y to W). So the angle is between YZ (vertical side) and diagonal YW. To find this angle, we can use the slope of YW.

Coordinates: Let's assign coordinates for clarity. Let W = (0,0), X = (a,0), Y = (a,b), Z = (0,b).

Diagonal WY goes from (0,0) to (a,b). Diagonal XZ goes from (a,0) to (0,b).

At point Y (a,b), side YZ goes from Y(a,b) to Z(0,b), which is horizontal left. Diagonal YW goes from Y(a,b) to W(0,0). The angle between YZ (leftward) and YW (down-and-left) at point Y.

To find this angle, let's calculate the slope of YW. From Y(a,b) to W(0,0): slope is (0 - b)/(0 - a) = (-b)/(-a) = b/a. The direction of YZ is horizontal to the left, which is along negative x-axis. The angle between YZ (negative x-axis) and YW (line from Y to W) can be found using the arctangent of the slope.

The slope of YW is b/a, so the angle θ between YW and the x-axis is arctan(b/a). But since YZ is along the negative x-axis, the angle between YZ and YW is 180° - θ. Wait, no. Let me visualize: from point Y(a,b), moving left along YZ (towards Z(0,b)), and moving down towards W(0,0). The angle between YZ and YW is the angle between the negative x-axis and the line YW.

The slope of YW is rise over run: from Y(a,b) to W(0,0), the change in y is -b, change in x is -a. So the angle that YW makes with the positive x-axis is arctan(b/a) below the x-axis. But since we are measuring from the negative x-axis (direction of YZ), the angle between YZ (negative x-axis) and YW would be arctan(b/a) + 90°? Not sure. Let's do vector analysis.

Vector YZ is from Y to Z: (-a, 0).
Vector YW is from Y to W: (-a, -b).

The angle between vectors YZ and YW can be found using the dot product:

cosθ = (YZ · YW) / (|YZ| |YW|)

YZ · YW = (-a)(-a) + (0)(-b) = a² + 0 = a²

|YZ| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a

|YW| = sqrt(a² + b²)

Thus,

cosθ = a² / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

We know from earlier that b/a = tan(30°) = 1/√3 ⇒ b = a/√3.

Substitute b = a/√3:

sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(a² + a²/3) = a * sqrt(1 + 1/3) = a * sqrt(4/3) = a*(2/sqrt(3))

Thus,

cosθ = a / (a * 2/sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(3)/2

Therefore, θ = 30°, since cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, so the angle between YZ and YW at point Y is 30°, which would be angle 6? If so, then m∠6 = 30°, which would correspond to option A. But earlier we had angle 6 being a right angle. But according to this calculation, it's 30°. But the problem states that Angle(6) is a right angle. This is conflicting.

But wait, in our calculation, we found that the angle between YZ and YW is 30°, but the problem says RightAngle(Angle(6)). So this suggests that either the label of angle 6 is different, or there's an error in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 6 is referring to another angle. Let me re-examine the problem's angle definitions.

The problem lists angles like Angle(W,X,Y), Angle(W,Y,Z), etc. These are the angles at each vertex of the rectangle. For example, Angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between W-X-Y, which is 90°. Similarly, Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between W-Y-Z. Wait, W-Y is a diagonal, and Y-Z is a side. So that angle is the one we just computed as 30°, which would be Angle(W,Y,Z). If that's labeled as Angle(6), then m∠6 = 30°, making the answer A. But the problem says RightAngle(Angle(6)), implying it's 90°, which contradicts.

This indicates that there's a mislabeling in the problem. Perhaps the user meant that Angle(6) is a right angle, but based on the calculation, it's 30°. Alternatively, if angle 6 is a different angle.

Alternatively, if angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals. Earlier, we considered that if angle 1 is 30°, then the other angles would be 150°, but if angle 6 is one of those, it could be 150°, but none of the options include that.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 6 is the angle between diagonal WY and side XY. Let's calculate that. At point X, between W-X-Y. Wait, that's the angle at X of the rectangle, which is 90°. But if angle 6 is that, then it's 90°, making the answer D. But then angle 1 is 30°, which would be another angle. How?

Maybe angle 1 is the angle between diagonal WY and side WX at point W. Let's calculate that. At point W, between W-X and W-Y. So, angle between side WX (along x-axis) and diagonal WY (going to Y(a,b)). The angle α at point W between WX and WY is arctan(b/a), which we've established is 30°, as given. So angle 1 is 30°, and angle 6 is the angle at point X between W-X-Y, which is 90°, hence answer D.

But the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(6)), so angle 6 is a right angle. This fits, as the angle at X is 90°. So angle 6 is the angle at X, which is 90°, hence answer D. But why is angle 1 given as 30°? Because angle 1 is the angle between diagonal WY and side WX at point W, which is 30°, and angle 6 is the right angle at X. Thus, the measure of angle 6 is 90°, so answer D.

But this requires that angle 6 is the right angle at X, which is one of the standard angles of the rectangle. However, the problem lists multiple angles (1-12), and specifies that Angle(6) is a right angle. Hence, angle 6 is one of the 90° angles of the rectangle. Thus, the answer is D, 90°.

But why is angle 1 given as 30°? Because angle 1 is the angle between diagonal and side, which depends on the rectangle's proportions. But since the problem provides that angle 1 is 30°, it's consistent with the rectangle having sides in a ratio that makes that angle 30°, but angle 6 remains 90°, as it's a standard angle of the rectangle.

Thus, the correct answer is D, 90°.
