MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says we have a parallelogram MNPQ. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, right? So angle M is equal to angle P, and angle N is equal to angle Q. Also, consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. That means they add up to 180 degrees. 

Wait, the question gives us that angle M is 10x and angle N is 20x. Since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, angle M and angle N should add up to 180 degrees. Let me check that. 

So if angle M is 10x and angle N is 20x, then 10x + 20x = 180 degrees. Combining like terms, that's 30x = 180. Then solving for x would give x = 180 / 30 = 6. 

Then, angle M is 10x, so substituting x=6, angle M would be 10*6 = 60 degrees. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything here. 

Hold on, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle M and angle N are adjacent, right? Because in a parallelogram, the order of the vertices matters. If it's M, N, P, Q, then the sides are MN, NP, PQ, QM. So angle M is at vertex M, between sides MN and MQ. Then angle N is at vertex N, between sides NM and NP. So yes, angles M and N are adjacent. Therefore, their sum should be 180 degrees. 

Therefore, my calculation seems correct. So angle M is 10x, angle N is 20x. Sum is 30x = 180 => x=6. Hence angle M is 60 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 60. So the answer should be C. 

But wait, let me double-check. Another way: since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. So angle M equals angle P, and angle N equals angle Q. The sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. So adding up all angles: 2*(angle M) + 2*(angle N) = 360. Which simplifies to 2*(10x + 20x) = 360. So 2*(30x)=360 => 60x=360 => x=6. Same as before. Then angle M is 10x=60. Yep, same result. So answer is C. 

I think that's solid. No mistakes here. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary (they add up to 180°), and opposite angles are equal. Given the angles $ m\angle M = 10x $ and $ m\angle N = 20x $, these two angles are adjacent, so their sum must equal 180°:

$$
10x + 20x = 180^\circ \\
30x = 180^\circ \\
x = 6
$$

Substituting $ x = 6 $ into $ m\angle M = 10x $:

$$
m\angle M = 10 \times 6 = 60^\circ
$$

This matches **option C**. Verifying via the total interior angles of a quadrilateral ($ 360^\circ $):

$$
2(10x) + 2(20x) = 360^\circ \\
60x = 360^\circ \\
x = 6
$$

Again, $ m\angle M = 60^\circ $.
