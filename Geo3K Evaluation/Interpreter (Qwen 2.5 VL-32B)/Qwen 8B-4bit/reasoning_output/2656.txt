<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of this parallelogram. So, first, I need to recall some properties of parallelograms. From what I remember, the area of a parallelogram is base times height. But wait, sometimes people use adjacent sides multiplied by the sine of the included angle. Hmm, but maybe here we have more direct information.

Looking at the given predicates, there's a lot about lengths and angles. Let me list them out again. There's a Parallelogram(A,B,C,D) so points A, B, C, D form a parallelogram. Then there are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). Also, Line(C,E) where E is another point. 

Some equalities: Length of Line(A,B) is 10, and Length of Line(A,D) is 13. Wait, since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and AD equals BC. So AB=CD=10, AD=BC=13. That seems straightforward. 

Also, there are some parallel lines: Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(C,D)) and Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)). Which makes sense because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. 

Then there's a RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,B)) is 45 degrees. Also, Congruent(Line(C,E), Line(B,E)). So point E forms a right angle at E with angle CEB being 45 degrees, and CE equals BE. 

Wait, so Triangle CEB is a right-angled isoceles triangle? Because CE = BE, and angle at E is 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, the angle is at E, right? Angle CEB means vertex at E, so the angle between EC and EB is 45 degrees. Wait, but the measure is given as 45 degrees. And CE is congruent to BE. So triangle CEB has legs CE and BE equal, and angle at E is 45 degrees. Wait, but in a triangle, if two sides are equal and the angle between them is 45 degrees, then it's an isoceles triangle with base angles... Wait, but the angle at E is 45 degrees. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me draw this mentally. Points C, E, B. So E is connected to C and B. The angle at E is 45 degrees. Also, CE is congruent to BE. So triangle CEB has CE = BE, and angle at E is 45 degrees. Therefore, triangle CEB is an isoceles right triangle? Wait, no. Because in an isoceles right triangle, the angles would be 45-45-90. But here, the angle at E is 45 degrees, and the two sides CE and BE are equal. So that would make the other two angles equal. Wait, sum of angles in a triangle is 180. So angle at E is 45, and angles at C and B would each be (180-45)/2 = 67.5 degrees. But maybe that's not directly helpful yet.

But perhaps this triangle relates to the parallelogram somehow. Since E is a point connected to C and B, maybe it's inside the parallelogram? Or outside?

Alternatively, maybe we can find coordinates. Assign coordinates to points A, B, C, D to calculate the area. Let me think. Since we know the lengths of AB and AD, and the angle between them? Wait, do we know the angle between AB and AD? Not directly. However, there's something about the angle at E. Maybe we can relate that angle to the angle of the parallelogram.

Alternatively, since the area of a parallelogram can also be found using the formula ab sin(theta), where theta is the angle between sides a and b. Here, if AB is one side (length 10), AD is another side (length 13), and theta is the angle between them. So if we can find theta, then compute 10*13*sin(theta).

But how do we find theta? The angle at E is 45 degrees, and CE = BE. Let me see. Let's consider coordinates again. Suppose we place point B at the origin (0,0), and point C somewhere along the x-axis. Wait, but maybe better to assign coordinates such that calculations are easier.

Let me try assigning coordinates. Let’s assume point A is at (0,0). Then since AB is length 10, suppose point B is at (10,0). Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB is (10,0), so vector DC should be same as AB. Point D is connected to A and C. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s say point A is at (0,0). Let’s suppose AB is horizontal, so B is at (10,0). Now, since AD is length 13, and angle at A is determined by the coordinates of D. Let me call point D as (p,q). Then AD has length sqrt(p² + q²) = 13. Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is (10,0), so vector DC should also be (10,0). So point C would be D plus vector AB. So if D is (p,q), then C is (p+10, q). 

Now, point E is connected via Line(C,E) and Line(B,E). Also, CE = BE. And angle CEB is 45 degrees. Let me write coordinates for E. Let me denote E as (x,y). Then CE is the distance between C (which is p+10, q) and E (x,y): sqrt[(x - (p+10))² + (y - q)²]. Similarly, BE is distance between B (10,0) and E (x,y): sqrt[(x - 10)² + (y - 0)²]. Given that CE = BE, so:

sqrt[(x - p -10)^2 + (y - q)^2] = sqrt[(x -10)^2 + y^2]

Square both sides:

(x - p -10)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x -10)^2 + y^2

Expand left side: (x - p -10)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x -10 - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = [ (x -10) - p ]^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x-10)^2 - 2p(x-10) + p² + (y - q)^2

Right side is (x-10)^2 + y².

So equate:

(x-10)^2 - 2p(x-10) + p² + (y - q)^2 = (x-10)^2 + y²

Subtract (x-10)^2 from both sides:

-2p(x -10) + p² + (y - q)^2 = y²

Expand (y - q)^2: y² - 2qy + q²

Thus:

-2p(x -10) + p² + y² - 2qy + q² = y²

Cancel y² from both sides:

-2p(x -10) + p² - 2qy + q² = 0

Rearranged:

-2p(x -10) - 2qy + p² + q² = 0

Hmm, not sure if this helps yet. Also, considering the angle at E is 45 degrees. The angle between vectors EC and EB is 45 degrees. Let me think. The vectors EC and EB. Vector EC is from E to C: (p+10 - x, q - y). Vector EB is from E to B: (10 - x, 0 - y). The angle between these vectors is 45 degrees.

Using the dot product formula: cos(theta) = (EC · EB) / (|EC| |EB|)

Since theta is 45 degrees, cos(theta) is √2 / 2.

But we also know that |EC| = |EB|, since CE = BE. So |EC| = |EB| = let's call it k.

Therefore, the dot product EC · EB = |EC||EB|cos(theta) = k² * (√2 / 2)

Compute the dot product:

EC · EB = (p+10 - x)(10 - x) + (q - y)(-y)

Let me expand this:

First term: (p +10 -x)(10 -x) = (p +10 -x)(10 -x) 

Second term: (q - y)(-y) = -y(q - y) = -qy + y²

So total dot product:

(p +10 -x)(10 -x) - qy + y²

But this seems complicated. However, since |EC| = |EB|, and earlier equation from CE = BE gives us some relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express variables. But maybe this coordinate system is getting too messy. Perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, since CE = BE, point E lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment CB. Because the set of points equidistant from C and B is the perpendicular bisector of CB. So E is somewhere on that line. Also, the angle at E is 45 degrees. So combining those conditions.

Let me find coordinates of C and B. Earlier, I had assumed A(0,0), B(10,0), D(p,q), C(p+10, q). So coordinates of C are (p+10, q), B is (10,0). So midpoint of CB is [(p+10 + 10)/2, (q + 0)/2] = ((p + 20)/2, q/2). The slope of CB is [q - 0]/[ (p +10) - 10 ] = q/p. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector has slope -p/q.

Equation of perpendicular bisector: passing through midpoint ((p+20)/2, q/2) with slope -p/q.

So parametric equations for E can be expressed as moving along this line. Also, angle CEB is 45 degrees. So E lies on this perpendicular bisector and satisfies the angle condition.

Alternatively, maybe choosing specific coordinates to simplify. For example, suppose we take p and q such that AD is vertical? Wait, but AD is length 13. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe take specific values for p and q. For instance, suppose AD is vertical, making angle BAD 90 degrees? No, but that would make it a rectangle, but we don't know if it's a rectangle. Wait, but the problem states it's a parallelogram, not necessarily a rectangle. So angle BAD could be anything.

Alternatively, since we need to find the area, which is base * height. We know the lengths of AB and AD, but need the height corresponding to one of them. Alternatively, using the formula involving sine of the angle between them. So area = AB * AD * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD.

So if I can find theta, then compute 10 * 13 * sin(theta). How to find theta?

From the given angle at E being 45 degrees. Let me think about triangle CEB. Since CE = BE, triangle CEB is isoceles with CE = BE and angle at E is 45 degrees. So the base angles at C and B are equal. Wait, in triangle CEB, angles at C and B are equal? Wait, no. In triangle CEB, the sides opposite angles are proportional. Wait, CE = BE, so angles opposite those sides are equal. So angle at B (angle at B in triangle CEB) is equal to angle at C (angle at C in triangle CEB). Wait, but angle at E is 45 degrees, so the other two angles add up to 135 degrees, so each is 67.5 degrees.

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? Maybe considering triangle CEB and its relation to the parallelogram. Let me visualize: points C and B are vertices of the parallelogram. So CB is one of the sides? Wait, CB is part of the parallelogram. Wait, in the parallelogram ABCD, AB and DC are one pair of sides, AD and BC are the other pair. So BC is a side of the parallelogram, length 13. Wait, yes, since AD = BC = 13.

So CB is length 13. In triangle CEB, CE = BE, and CB is the base. So triangle CEB has sides CE = BE, and CB is the third side. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle CEB: CB² = CE² + BE² - 2*CE*BE*cos(angle at E). But CE = BE, let's call them both x. So CB² = x² + x² - 2x² cos(45°). Thus, CB² = 2x²(1 - cos(45°)).

We know CB is 13, so:

13² = 2x²(1 - √2/2 )

Solving for x:

x² = (169)/(2*(1 - √2/2 )) 

Calculate denominator: 1 - √2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.7071 ≈ 0.2929

So x² ≈ 169/(2*0.2929) ≈ 169 / 0.5858 ≈ approx 288.4

So x ≈ sqrt(288.4) ≈ 16.98. But not sure if this helps yet.

But maybe we can find the relationship between x and the parallelogram. However, I'm not seeing the connection directly. Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates again. Let me try.

Assume coordinates as before: A(0,0), B(10,0), D(p,q), C(p+10, q). So vector AD is (p,q), length sqrt(p² + q²)=13. Vector AB is (10,0). The angle between AB and AD is theta, which we need. The area is 10*13*sin(theta). So if we can find theta, we can compute the area.

How to find theta? Maybe through the triangle CEB. Let me find coordinates of E. Since CE = BE, and angle at E is 45 degrees. Also, E is a point such that CE = BE. As before, E lies on perpendicular bisector of CB. Coordinates of C are (p+10, q), B(10,0). Midpoint of CB is ((p+10 +10)/2, (q +0)/2 ) = ((p+20)/2, q/2 ). Slope of CB is (q - 0)/( (p+10) - 10 ) = q/p. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector has slope -p/q.

Parametric equations for E can be written as starting from midpoint and moving along direction perpendicular to CB. Let me parameterize E as follows: Let t be a parameter. Then coordinates of E are:

E_x = (p+20)/2 + t*(-q)

E_y = q/2 + t*p 

Because the direction vector perpendicular to CB is (-q, p) (since slope is -p/q). Wait, original slope of CB was q/p, so perpendicular slope is -p/q. So direction vector would be (q, -p)? Wait, no. Wait, the direction vector of CB is ( (p+10)-10, q - 0 ) = (p, q). So perpendicular direction would be (-q, p) or (q, -p). Let me check. The dot product of (p, q) and (-q, p) is -pq + pq = 0. Yes, that's perpendicular. So direction vector is (-q, p). So parametric equations for E can be:

Starting at midpoint ((p+20)/2, q/2 ), moving along direction (-q, p). So:

E_x = (p+20)/2 - q*t 

E_y = q/2 + p*t 

Now, the angle at E is 45 degrees. So using the angle between EC and EB. Let me compute vectors EC and EB.

Vector EC is C - E = [ (p+10) - E_x , q - E_y ]

Similarly, vector EB is B - E = [10 - E_x, 0 - E_y ]

So substituting E_x and E_y:

EC_x = p +10 - [ (p+20)/2 - q*t ] = p +10 - (p+20)/2 + q*t 

Let me compute this:

p +10 = (2p + 20)/2, so subtract (p+20)/2:

(2p + 20)/2 - (p + 20)/2 = (2p +20 - p -20)/2 = p/2

Thus, EC_x = p/2 + q*t 

EC_y = q - [ q/2 + p*t ] = q/2 - p*t 

Similarly, EB_x = 10 - E_x = 10 - [ (p+20)/2 - q*t ] = 10 - (p+20)/2 + q*t 

Convert 10 to 20/2:

= (20/2 - p -20)/2 + q*t ? Wait:

Wait 10 is 20/2, so:

10 - (p+20)/2 = (20/2 - p -20)/2? No. Wait:

Let me recompute:

EB_x = 10 - E_x = 10 - [ (p+20)/2 - q*t ] = 10 - (p+20)/2 + q*t 

Which is equal to [ (20 - p -20)/2 ] + q*t = (-p)/2 + q*t ?

Wait, 10 is 20/2, so 20/2 - (p +20)/2 = (20 - p -20)/2 = (-p)/2. So yes, EB_x = -p/2 + q*t 

Similarly, EB_y = 0 - E_y = - [ q/2 + p*t ] = -q/2 - p*t 

So vectors EC and EB are:

EC = (p/2 + q*t, q/2 - p*t )

EB = ( -p/2 + q*t, -q/2 - p*t )

Now, the angle between EC and EB is 45 degrees. So the cosine of the angle between them is √2/2.

Dot product of EC and EB divided by the product of their magnitudes equals √2/2.

Let me compute the dot product:

EC · EB = [p/2 + q*t][ -p/2 + q*t ] + [ q/2 - p*t ][ -q/2 - p*t ]

Let me compute each part.

First term: [p/2 + q*t][-p/2 + q*t] = -(p²)/4 + (p q t)/2 - (p q t)/2 + (q t)^2 = -p²/4 + q² t² 

Wait, expanding (a + b)(c + d):

Actually, let me multiply properly:

Multiply (p/2)(-p/2) + (p/2)(q*t) + (q*t)(-p/2) + (q*t)(q*t)

= -p²/4 + (p q t)/2 - (p q t)/2 + q² t² 

Simplify: -p²/4 + 0 + q² t² 

Second term: [ q/2 - p*t ][ -q/2 - p*t ] 

Multiply this out:

(q/2)(-q/2) + (q/2)(-p*t) + (-p*t)(-q/2) + (-p*t)(-p*t)

= -q²/4 - (p q t)/2 + (p q t)/2 + p² t² 

Simplify: -q²/4 + 0 + p² t² 

So overall, the dot product is:

(-p²/4 + q² t² ) + (-q²/4 + p² t² ) = -p²/4 - q²/4 + q² t² + p² t² 

Factor terms:

= (- (p² + q²))/4 + t² (p² + q² )

Note that p² + q² is the square of the length of AD, which is 13² = 169. So:

Dot product = -169/4 + t² * 169 

Now, compute the magnitude of EC and EB. Since CE = BE, and from earlier, they are equal. Let me confirm that.

Earlier, we had CE = BE, which came from the equality of distances. So |EC| = |EB|. Hence, the magnitudes of EC and EB are equal, so their product is |EC|². 

Let me compute |EC|²:

|EC|² = (p/2 + q t)^2 + (q/2 - p t)^2 

Expanding:

= p²/4 + p q t + q² t² + q²/4 - p q t + p² t² 

Simplify:

The middle terms cancel: +p q t - p q t = 0 

So:

p²/4 + q²/4 + q² t² + p² t² 

= (p² + q²)/4 + t² (p² + q² ) 

Same as earlier expression. So |EC|² = (p² + q²)/4 + t² (p² + q² ) = 169/4 + 169 t² 

Therefore, the magnitude of EC is sqrt(169/4 + 169 t² ) = sqrt(169(t² + 1/4 )) = 13 sqrt(t² + 1/4 )

So back to the dot product: 

Dot product = -169/4 + 169 t² 

And |EC|² = 169(t² + 1/4 ), so |EC| * |EB| = 169(t² + 1/4 )

So the cosine of the angle between EC and EB is:

[ -169/4 + 169 t² ] / [ 169(t² + 1/4 ) ] = [ -1/4 + t² ] / [ t² + 1/4 ] 

Set this equal to cos(45°) = √2 / 2 

So:

[ t² - 1/4 ] / [ t² + 1/4 ] = √2 / 2 

Cross-multiplying:

2(t² - 1/4 ) = √2 (t² + 1/4 )

Let me rearrange:

2t² - 1/2 = √2 t² + √2 /4 

Bring all terms to left:

2t² - √2 t² - 1/2 - √2 /4 = 0 

Factor t²:

t² (2 - √2 ) - (1/2 + √2 /4 ) = 0 

Solve for t²:

t² = [ 1/2 + √2 /4 ] / (2 - √2 )

Let me rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √2 ):

Numerator becomes [1/2 + √2 /4 ] * (2 + √2 )

Denominator becomes (2 - √2 )(2 + √2 ) = 4 - 2 = 2 

Let me compute numerator:

First, expand [1/2 + √2 /4 ] * (2 + √2 )

Break into parts:

= 1/2 * 2 + 1/2 * √2 + √2 /4 * 2 + √2 /4 * √2 

Compute each term:

1/2 * 2 = 1 

1/2 * √2 = √2 / 2 

√2 /4 * 2 = √2 / 2 

√2 /4 * √2 = (2)/4 = 1/2 

Add them all together:

1 + √2 / 2 + √2 / 2 + 1/2 = 1 + √2 + 1/2 = 3/2 + √2 

So numerator is 3/2 + √2 

Denominator is 2 

Thus, t² = (3/2 + √2 ) / 2 = 3/4 + √2 / 2 

Now, substitute back into the expression for the dot product. Wait, but we already used that to get here. Now, how does this help us?

Well, we need to find the angle theta between AB and AD, which is the angle between vectors AB (from A to B: (10,0)) and AD (from A to D: (p,q)). So theta is the angle between vectors AB and AD. The cosine of theta is (AB · AD) / (|AB| |AD| )

AB · AD = (10,0) · (p,q) = 10p + 0*q = 10p 

|AB| = 10, |AD| = 13 

So cos(theta) = 10p / (10*13 ) = p / 13 

Similarly, sin(theta) can be found via sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - (p/13)^2 )

But how to find p?

Wait, we have earlier expressions involving t. Recall that in our parametrization of E, the coordinates depend on t. But we may need another equation to relate p and t. Wait, but we might not have enough info. Wait, but maybe there's a relation from the fact that E lies on the perpendicular bisector and the angle condition. However, we've already used that to find t in terms of p and q? Wait, no. Wait, in our calculation above, we arrived at t² = 3/4 + √2 / 2, but we haven't used any relation between p and q yet. However, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 169 (since AD is length 13).

Is there another condition that involves p and q? Let me think. Are there any constraints we missed?

Yes! Remember that the parallelogram has sides AB and AD. The angle between AB and AD is theta, which affects the position of point D. But without more information, we might need to find another relation. Wait, but perhaps we can find p in terms of t? Or maybe not. This seems stuck.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about triangle CEB again. Earlier, I tried to use Law of Cosines there. Let me revisit that.

In triangle CEB, with CE = BE = x, angle at E = 45°, and CB = 13. So applying Law of Cosines:

CB² = CE² + BE² - 2*CE*BE*cos(45°)

Which is:

13² = x² + x² - 2x² * cos(45°)

=> 169 = 2x² (1 - cos(45°))

As before. Solving for x²:

x² = 169 / [ 2(1 - cos(45°)) ]

Calculate cos(45°) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071

So 1 - cos(45°) ≈ 1 - 0.7071 ≈ 0.2929

So x² ≈ 169 / (2 * 0.2929) ≈ 169 / 0.5858 ≈ 288.4

So x ≈ sqrt(288.4) ≈ 16.98

But how does this help us? Well, CE = BE = x ≈ 16.98. But CE is a segment from C to E, and BE is from B to E. But how does this relate to the parallelogram?

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates again, but now knowing that CE = BE = x, and CB = 13. Let me think. In triangle CEB, with CB = 13, CE = BE = x. So this is an isoceles triangle with sides x, x, and 13. So using the Law of Sines: 

sin(angle at C)/13 = sin(45°)/x 

But angle at C is equal to angle at B, as discussed earlier. Let me denote angle at C as α, angle at B as α, and angle at E as 45°. So 2α + 45° = 180° => α = 67.5°. 

Thus, sin(α)/13 = sin(45°)/x 

So x = [13 * sin(45°)] / sin(67.5°)

Calculate this:

sin(67.5°) is sin(45° + 22.5°). Using identity:

sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b 

So sin(67.5°) = sin(45° + 22.5°) = sin(45°)cos(22.5°) + cos(45°)sin(22.5°)

Alternatively, use exact value: sin(67.5°) = sin(π/2 - π/8) = cos(π/8) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.9239

Or approximate decimal values:

sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071

sin(67.5°) ≈ 0.9239

So x ≈ [13 * 0.7071] / 0.9239 ≈ (9.1923) / 0.9239 ≈ 10. 

Wait, 13 * 0.7071 is approximately 9.1923. Divided by 0.9239 gives around 10. So x ≈ 10. 

Interesting. So CE = BE ≈ 10. But CE is the length from C to E, and BE is from B to E. So if BE is 10, and B is at (10,0), and E is some point such that BE = 10. But this might not directly help unless we relate it to other parts.

Wait, but earlier we had AB = 10. So BE is 10. Is there a possibility that BE is equal to AB? Maybe, but not sure.

Alternatively, since we have AB = 10 and BE = 10, maybe triangle ABE is isoceles? Not sure. Let me think.

But this suggests that x ≈ 10. So CE = BE ≈ 10. But CE is the distance from C to E, and BE is from B to E. If BE = 10, and AB = 10, perhaps there's a relation here.

But this is getting too vague. Let me go back to the earlier equation where we had t² = 3/4 + √2 / 2. Let me compute that numerically.

Compute 3/4 = 0.75, √2 ≈ 1.4142, so √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071. Adding them: 0.75 + 0.7071 ≈ 1.4571. So t² ≈ 1.4571 → t ≈ ±1.207.

But how does this help us? We still need to relate to p and q. Wait, in our parametrization, E is defined in terms of p and q. But we might need another equation to connect p and q. Wait, but we have p² + q² = 169. 

Wait, but earlier in the calculation for the dot product, we ended up with t² = ... but that was independent of p and q? No, wait, in the calculation for the dot product, we had used the fact that p² + q² = 169, but the expression for t² didn't involve p or q. Wait, how did that happen? Because during the calculation, we had canceled out p and q. 

Wait, let me go back. When we computed the dot product, we had:

Dot product = [ t² - 1/4 ] / [ t² + 1/4 ] = √2 / 2 

This led to solving for t², and it resulted in t² = 3/4 + √2 / 2. This seems to indicate that t is fixed, regardless of p and q? But how is that possible? It seems like we've derived t² independently of p and q, which suggests that this condition holds for any p and q as long as p² + q² = 169. But this can't be true, because the location of E depends on p and q. 

Ah, but perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me double-check. During the calculation of the dot product, we had:

After simplifying, the dot product became [ -169/4 + 169 t² ] / [ 169(t² + 1/4 ) ] = [ t² - 1/4 ] / [ t² + 1/4 ] 

But this assumes that p² + q² = 169. So even though we derived t² from this equation, it's under the assumption that p² + q² = 169. So this implies that for any parallelogram with AD = 13 and AB = 10, the value of t is fixed? But that doesn't make sense, because depending on the shape of the parallelogram, the position of E would vary. 

Wait, but maybe the condition that angle CEB is 45 degrees and CE = BE imposes a specific constraint on the parallelogram, thereby fixing the angle theta between AB and AD, thus allowing us to calculate the area.

Let me think differently. Since we have that in triangle CEB, with CB = 13, and CE = BE, and angle at E = 45°, we can find the length of CE and BE as x = 13 * sin(45°) / sin(67.5°). As calculated earlier, this is approximately 10. 

So x ≈ 10. So BE = 10. But BE is the distance from B to E, and AB is 10. So BE = AB = 10. So triangle ABE has AB = BE = 10. So it's an isoceles triangle with AB = BE. What does this tell us about the position of E?

Point B is at (10,0), and point A is at (0,0). So AB is from (0,0) to (10,0). Point E is such that BE = 10. So E lies on a circle centered at B with radius 10. Also, from earlier, E is on the perpendicular bisector of CB. But CB is from C to B. 

But without knowing where C is, this is tricky. However, since we know AD = 13, and AB = 10, and the parallelogram, maybe we can find relations between the coordinates.

Wait, but if BE = 10, and AB = 10, then in triangle ABE, AB = BE, so it's isoceles with apex at B. So angle at B is equal to angle at E. But angle at B is angle ABE. 

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates again. Let me assume that BE = 10, and B is at (10,0). So E is somewhere on the circle centered at B with radius 10. Let me assume E has coordinates (10 + 10 cosθ, 0 + 10 sinθ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. 

But also, E is on the perpendicular bisector of CB. Let me recall that C is at (p+10, q), and B is at (10,0). So the midpoint of CB is ((p+20)/2, q/2), and the perpendicular bisector has slope -p/q. 

But this seems too abstract. Maybe instead of general p and q, use specific values. Let me assume that AD is at a certain angle. Let me choose coordinates where AD is vertical. Wait, but AD is length 13. Let me say D is at (0,13), so AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,13). Then AB is from (0,0) to (10,0). So the parallelogram ABCD would have points A(0,0), B(10,0), C(10,13), D(0,13). Wait, but in this case, it's a rectangle, since all angles are 90 degrees. But then the angle at E would be... Let me check.

But in this case, CB is from C(10,13) to B(10,0), so it's vertical line x=10 from (10,0) to (10,13). The perpendicular bisector of CB is horizontal line through midpoint (10, 13/2). So E is on this line, y = 13/2. Also, BE = 10. B is at (10,0), so distance from B(10,0) to E(x, 13/2) is sqrt((x-10)^2 + (13/2)^2) = 10. 

So:

(x-10)^2 + (169/4) = 100 

=> (x-10)^2 = 100 - 169/4 = (400/4 - 169/4) = 231/4 

=> x-10 = ±√(231)/2 

≈ ±15.1987/2 ≈ ±7.599 

So E is at (10 ± 7.599, 6.5). Now, check if angle CEB is 45 degrees. Let's pick E as (10 + 7.599, 6.5). Compute angle at E between C(10,13) and B(10,0). 

Vectors EC and EB: 

EC = C - E = (10 - (10 + 7.599), 13 - 6.5) = (-7.599, 6.5)

EB = B - E = (10 - (10 + 7.599), 0 - 6.5) = (-7.599, -6.5)

The angle between vectors (-7.599, 6.5) and (-7.599, -6.5). Let's compute the dot product:

(-7.599)*(-7.599) + (6.5)*(-6.5) = (7.599)^2 - (6.5)^2 

Calculate:

7.599^2 ≈ 57.74 

6.5^2 = 42.25 

Difference ≈ 57.74 - 42.25 = 15.49 

Magnitude of EC: sqrt(7.599² + 6.5²) ≈ sqrt(57.74 + 42.25) = sqrt(99.99) ≈ 10 

Magnitude of EB is the same as EC, since it's the same vector magnitude. 

So cos(theta) = 15.49 / (10*10) = 15.49 / 100 = 0.1549 

Which corresponds to theta ≈ arccos(0.1549) ≈ 81.2 degrees, not 45 degrees. So this contradicts the given condition. Hence, my assumption that AD is vertical leads to inconsistency with the angle condition. So this suggests that the parallelogram isn't a rectangle, and my assumption of AD being vertical is invalid.

This indicates that the parallelogram is not a rectangle, and the angle between AB and AD is not 90 degrees. Hence, we need to find the correct angle theta.

Back to the previous idea: using the Law of Cosines in triangle CEB, we found that x ≈ 10, where x is BE. So BE = 10, and AB = 10. So in triangle ABE, AB = BE = 10. Let me consider this triangle. 

Points A(0,0), B(10,0), and E somewhere such that BE = 10. So E is on the circle centered at B with radius 10. Also, angle at E is 45 degrees in triangle CEB. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram, C is determined by A, B, D. If D is (p, q), then C is (p+10, q). So CB is from C(p+10, q) to B(10,0). The midpoint of CB is ((p+20)/2, q/2). The perpendicular bisector passes through this midpoint and has slope -p/q. 

But if we assume BE = 10, and E is on this perpendicular bisector, then perhaps we can find relations between p and q. 

Let me attempt to write equations. Let me denote E as lying on the perpendicular bisector of CB, so its coordinates are ((p+20)/2 + t*(-q), q/2 + t*p), as before. And BE = 10. 

Distance from B(10,0) to E is sqrt([((p+20)/2 - q*t -10]^2 + [q/2 + p*t - 0]^2 ) = 10 

Let me simplify:

First component: ((p+20)/2 - 10) - q*t = (p+20 - 20)/2 - q*t = p/2 - q*t 

Second component: q/2 + p*t 

So squared distance is [p/2 - q*t]^2 + [q/2 + p*t]^2 = 100 

Expand:

= (p²/4 - p q t + q² t²) + (q²/4 + p q t + p² t²) 

Combine terms:

p²/4 + q²/4 + q² t² + p² t² 

= (p² + q²)/4 + t² (p² + q² ) 

Which is the same as before, and since p² + q² = 169, this becomes 169/4 + 169 t² = 100 

So:

169/4 + 169 t² = 100 

Divide both sides by 169:

1/4 + t² = 100 / 169 

So t² = 100/169 - 1/4 = (400 - 169)/676 = 231/676 

So t = ±√(231)/26 ≈ ±15.1987/26 ≈ ±0.5845 

But earlier, from the angle condition, we had t² = 3/4 + √2 / 2 ≈ 1.4571, which conflicts with this t² = 231/676 ≈ 0.341. This contradiction suggests an error in assumptions.

Wait, this indicates that the two conditions (BE = 10 and angle at E is 45 degrees) lead to conflicting values for t, implying that my earlier assumption that BE = 10 is incorrect. Where did that come from?

Earlier, I thought that from the Law of Cosines in triangle CEB, x = BE = 13 * sin(45°) / sin(67.5°) ≈ 10. But this calculation might be wrong. Let me redo it.
