Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. The goal is to find the value of x, which is the measure of angle AFD. 

Starting with STEP 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup. Let me list out all the points and lines mentioned. There are points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Lines connecting them: AB, BG, GH, AF, FD, GC, FE, CE, AC, DF. Also, there are several angles mentioned: Angle at HGB is 55 degrees, Angle AFD is x, Angle GCF is a right angle, Angle FED is a right angle, and Angle ACF is also a right angle. Plus, some perpendicular and parallel relationships. 

So, first, note that several angles are right angles. For example, Angle GCF is right, so lines GC and CF are perpendicular. Similarly, Angle FED is right, so FE and ED are perpendicular. And Angle ACF is right, meaning AC and CF are perpendicular. Wait, but if AC and CF are perpendicular, and GC and CF are also perpendicular, does that mean that AC is parallel to GC? Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they should be parallel. So maybe lines AC and GC are parallel?

But wait, looking at the Parallel predicates: Line GC is parallel to FE, and Line AC is parallel to DF. Also, Perpendicular relationships: Line GC is perpendicular to AC, and FE is perpendicular to AC. So since GC is parallel to FE, and both are perpendicular to AC, that would make FE and GC both perpendicular to AC, hence parallel to each other. That checks out. 

Also, since AC is parallel to DF, and DF is connected to point D and F. Let me try to sketch mentally. Maybe I should consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to points to model the situation. Let me assume point A is at origin (0,0). Since AC is a line, and it's perpendicular to GC and FE. Let me think about directions. Suppose AC is horizontal. Then GC and FE are vertical. But since GC is parallel to FE, they are both vertical. 

Wait, but Angle GCF is a right angle. So at point C, lines GC and CF meet at a right angle. So if GC is vertical (as per being perpendicular to AC), then CF would be horizontal. But AC is horizontal, so CF would be along the same direction as AC? Wait, if AC is horizontal, then CF would be vertical? No, because GC is vertical (since it's perpendicular to AC). At point C, GC is vertical, and CF is connected to point F. Since Angle GCF is right, then CF is horizontal. Therefore, CF is horizontal. But AC is horizontal as well. So AC and CF are both horizontal, making them collinear? Wait, but if AC is horizontal and CF is horizontal, then points A, C, F are colinear? But there's a line AC and another line CF. Wait, unless F is on line AC. But according to the lines given, there's a line AF and a line DF. Hmm. Let me try to get more precise.

Let me assign coordinates. Let’s place point A at (0,0). Let’s suppose AC is horizontal. Let’s say point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0. Since AC is horizontal, and GC is perpendicular to AC, so GC is vertical. Let’s say point G is somewhere along the vertical line passing through C. Wait, but there's a line BG. Let me think. Points B, G, H form part of the diagram. Also, line BG connects B to G. Also, line GH connects G to H. 

Since GC is vertical (assuming AC is horizontal), and line GC is parallel to FE. So FE is vertical. Also, FE is perpendicular to AC (from the predicate: Perpendicular(Line(FE), Line(AC)). Wait, but AC is horizontal, so FE is vertical. Which aligns with GC being vertical. 

Moreover, line FE is connected to point F and E. Also, there's line DF, which is parallel to AC. Since AC is horizontal, DF is also horizontal. So line DF is horizontal. Point D is connected via line DF to F, so DF is horizontal. Therefore, points D and F are aligned horizontally. 

Now, considering that line AF exists. So from A(0,0) to F. Since DF is horizontal and connects D to F, and F is connected to E via FE (which is vertical). So perhaps F is the intersection point of AF and DF. Wait, but AF is a line from A to F, and DF is a line from D to F. So F is a common point. 

Let me try to assign coordinates step by step. Let me fix coordinates for clarity. Let’s set A at (0,0). Let’s assume AC is horizontal. Let’s take AC as the x-axis. Let’s say point C is at (c, 0). Since line GC is vertical (because it's perpendicular to AC), then point G lies somewhere along the vertical line through C. Let’s say G is at (c, g_y). Then line GC goes from C(c,0) to G(c,g_y). 

Now, line FE is parallel to GC, so FE is vertical. Also, FE is perpendicular to AC (given), which matches since AC is horizontal and FE is vertical. So FE is vertical. So line FE passes through point F and E, and is vertical. Therefore, points F and E have the same x-coordinate. 

Also, line DF is parallel to AC (horizontal), so DF is horizontal. So line DF connects D to F, and since it's horizontal, D and F share the same y-coordinate. 

Additionally, line AF connects A(0,0) to F(x_f, y_f). Since DF is horizontal, and F is connected to D, which is on DF. So if DF is horizontal, then D has coordinates (d_x, y_f), where d_x ≠ x_f. 

Also, there's line FE, which is vertical, passing through F(x_f, y_f) and E(x_f, e_y). 

Now, we also know that there's a right angle at FED (angle FED is right). So at point E, lines FE and ED form a right angle. Since FE is vertical (x_f fixed), then ED must be horizontal. Therefore, ED is horizontal. Thus, point D lies on the horizontal line passing through E. Wait, but D is connected to F via DF, which is horizontal. So D is on the same horizontal line as F. Therefore, point D is horizontally aligned with F, and ED is horizontal. So E is vertically aligned with D? Or not sure yet. 

Also, there's line CE connecting C to E. Given that angle at C (GCF) is a right angle, and line CE connects C to E. Also, line FE connects F to E. 

Let me try to track down coordinates. Let's suppose F is at (f_x, f_y). Since DF is horizontal, D is (d_x, f_y). FE is vertical, so E is (f_x, e_y). 

Line CE connects C(c,0) to E(f_x, e_y). Also, line FE connects F(f_x, f_y) to E(f_x, e_y). 

We also have angle at FED being right. So at point E, angle between FE and ED is right. Since FE is vertical (from F(f_x, f_y) up/down to E(f_x, e_y)), and ED is horizontal (from E(f_x, e_y) to D(d_x, f_y)). Wait, ED connects E to D. Since D is (d_x, f_y), and E is (f_x, e_y), then vector ED is (d_x - f_x, f_y - e_y). For ED to be horizontal, its y-component must be zero. So f_y - e_y = 0 → e_y = f_y. Therefore, E is at (f_x, f_y), same as F's y-coordinate. But that would mean E is vertically aligned with F. However, FE is vertical, so E is directly above or below F. But since angle FED is right, and ED is horizontal, then D must be horizontally aligned with E. Wait, if E is (f_x, f_y), then ED is horizontal, so D is (something, f_y). But D is already on DF which is horizontal at y=f_y. So yes, that works. Therefore, E is at (f_x, f_y), same as F's y-coordinate. Wait, but that would imply that E is vertically aligned with F, but since FE is vertical, then E is either straight up or down from F. Wait, if E is at (f_x, f_y), then FE is a single point? No, that can't be. Wait, if E is at (f_x, f_y), then E coincides with F? No, that doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake here. 

Wait, earlier conclusion was that for ED to be horizontal, the y-coordinate of E must be equal to the y-coordinate of D. Since D is on DF, which is horizontal at y = f_y (the y-coordinate of F). So E's y-coordinate must be f_y. Therefore, E is at (e_x, f_y). But FE is vertical, so E must lie directly above or below F. Therefore, E's x-coordinate must be the same as F's x-coordinate. Hence, E is (f_x, f_y). But that would put E at the same position as F, which isn't possible. Contradiction! Where did I go wrong?

Ah, let me re-examine. The line FE is vertical, so E is vertically aligned with F. Therefore, E has the same x-coordinate as F. So E is (f_x, e_y). Now, ED is horizontal, so moving from E to D must be horizontal. Therefore, D must have the same y-coordinate as E. So D's y-coordinate is e_y. But DF is horizontal, so D and F have the same y-coordinate. Therefore, F's y-coordinate is equal to e_y. Hence, F's y-coordinate equals E's y-coordinate. Therefore, D's y-coordinate equals F's y-coordinate. Thus, D and F are on the same horizontal line. 

Therefore, E is vertically aligned with F (same x-coordinate), and D is horizontally aligned with F (same y-coordinate). Therefore, E's coordinates are (f_x, e_y), and D is (d_x, f_y). Since E's y-coordinate is e_y, and D's y-coordinate is f_y, then for ED to be horizontal, e_y must equal f_y. Therefore, E is (f_x, f_y), same as F's y-coordinate. But that would mean that E is on the same horizontal line as F. But FE is vertical, so E is directly above or below F. Therefore, if E is (f_x, f f_y), then FE is vertical, and ED is horizontal, going from E(f_x, f_y) to D(d_x, f_y). So that works. So E is vertically aligned with F, and D is horizontally aligned with F. 

Thus, E is (f_x, f_y), and D is (d_x, f_y). Therefore, ED is horizontal from E(f_x, f_y) to D(d_x, f_y). 

Now, line CE connects C(c, 0) to E(f_x, f_y). Also, there's a right angle at ACF (angle ACF is right). So at point C, lines AC and CF meet at a right angle. Since AC is horizontal (from A(0,0) to C(c,0)), and CF is from C(c,0) to F(f_x, f_y). This angle being right implies that vectors AC and CF are perpendicular. Vector AC is (c, 0), and vector CF is (f_x - c, f_y - 0) = (f_x - c, f_y). Their dot product should be zero:

AC • CF = c*(f_x - c) + 0*f_y = c(f_x - c) = 0 ⇒ c(f_x - c) = 0. Assuming c ≠ 0 (since C is not overlapping with A), then f_x - c = 0 ⇒ f_x = c. Therefore, F has x-coordinate equal to c. So F is at (c, f_y). 

So F is (c, f_y). Then, since DF is horizontal, D is (d_x, f_y). Also, line DF connects D(d_x, f_y) to F(c, f_y). So DF is horizontal. 

Now, since line AF connects A(0,0) to F(c, f_y). Let's compute the slope of AF. Slope is (f_y - 0)/(c - 0) = f_y / c. 

Also, angle AFD is the angle at point F between lines AF and FD. We need to find the measure of this angle, which is x. 

Let me analyze triangle AFD. Point A is (0,0), F is (c, f_y), D is (d_x, f_y). So FD is horizontal from F(c, f_y) to D(d_x, f_y). AF is from A(0,0) to F(c, f_y). 

To find angle at F (AFD), we can use coordinates. The angle between AF and FD. 

Vector FA is from F to A: (-c, -f_y). Vector FD is from F to D: (d_x - c, 0). 

The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (FA • FD) / (|FA| |FD|)

Compute FA • FD = (-c)(d_x - c) + (-f_y)(0) = -c(d_x - c)

|FA| = sqrt(c² + f_y²)

|FD| = sqrt((d_x - c)^2 + 0^2) = |d_x - c|

Therefore,

cos(theta) = [-c(d_x - c)] / [sqrt(c² + f_y²) * |d_x - c|] ] 

Assuming d_x ≠ c (otherwise FD would have length zero, which isn't possible), we can simplify:

cos(theta) = [-c]/sqrt(c² + f_y²) 

But theta is the angle between FA and FD, which is angle AFD. However, depending on the sign, we might need to adjust. Also, since angle AFD is formed at F, and FD is horizontal to the left or right depending on d_x compared to c. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way using slopes. The line AF has slope m_AF = f_y / c. The line FD is horizontal, so its slope is 0. The angle between AF and FD can be found by taking arctangent of the absolute value of the slope of AF. Wait, because the angle between a line with slope m and the horizontal axis is arctan(m). Therefore, the angle between AF and FD (which is horizontal) is simply arctan(|m_AF|). But since we're dealing with actual angles, we have to consider direction. 

Wait, angle AFD is the angle between AF and FD. Since FD is horizontal, the angle is measured from FD to AF. Depending on the direction, it could be acute or obtuse. 

But given that there are right angles involved elsewhere, maybe we can find relations between angles. Also, recall that angle AFD is x, and we have other angles given. 

Also, note that there's a right angle at ACF (angle ACF is right). Earlier, we determined that F_x = c. Also, line GC is vertical (since it's perpendicular to AC), so G is (c, g_y). Line BG connects B to G. Line GH connects G to H. Also, angle HGB is 55 degrees. 

Perhaps I need to find relations between these elements. Let me see. 

Since line GC is vertical (from C(c,0) to G(c, g_y)), and line FE is parallel to GC, FE is vertical. As established earlier, FE is vertical, so E is (c, f_y). Wait, earlier we had E at (f_x, f_y), and since f_x = c, then E is (c, f_y). Therefore, E is vertically aligned with F. 

Then line CE connects C(c,0) to E(c, f_y). Therefore, CE is vertical line from (c,0) to (c, f_y). Therefore, CE is vertical. 

But line CE is also connected to point E, which is (c, f_y). 

Now, let's look at angle at C: angle GCF is right angle. Since GC is vertical from C(c,0) to G(c, g_y), and CF is from C(c,0) to F(c, f_y). Wait, but if F is at (c, f_y), then CF is vertical as well. So angle at C between GC and CF is between two vertical lines? That would make the angle undefined (they are overlapping), but the predicate says it's a right angle. Contradiction? Wait, that suggests something is wrong. 

Hold on, earlier we concluded that F_x = c due to the right angle at ACF. But if that's true, then CF is vertical, same as GC. So angle GCF would be between GC and CF, which are the same line. That can't be right. So where is the mistake?

Earlier, when analyzing the right angle at ACF (angle ACF), I assumed that AC and CF are perpendicular. Since AC is horizontal from A(0,0) to C(c,0), then CF must be vertical. But line GC is also vertical (since it's perpendicular to AC). So angle GCF is the angle between GC and CF. If both are vertical lines, then they are the same line, making the angle undefined. But the predicate states that angle GCF is a right angle. Therefore, my assumption that F_x = c must be incorrect. 

This indicates a flaw in previous reasoning. Let me backtrack. 

When I considered the right angle at ACF, I said that vectors AC and CF are perpendicular. Vector AC is (c, 0), vector CF is (F_x - c, F_y - 0). Their dot product is c*(F_x - c) + 0*F_y = c(F_x - c) = 0. So c(F_x - c) = 0. Since c ≠ 0 (as C is distinct from A), then F_x - c = 0 ⇒ F_x = c. But this leads to CF being vertical, conflicting with GC also being vertical. 

But the predicate says angle GCF is a right angle. So this suggests that lines GC and CF are perpendicular. Wait, angle at C between GC and CF is a right angle. So lines GC and CF are perpendicular. But if GC is vertical (perpendicular to AC), and CF is also vertical, then they are parallel, not perpendicular. Contradiction again. 

Hmm, so there's a contradiction here. What went wrong? Let me check the premises again. 

Given that Perpendicular(Line(GC), Line(AC)) — so GC is perpendicular to AC. And Perpendicular(Line(FE), Line(AC)) — FE is perpendicular to AC. Also, Parallel(Line(GC), Line(FE)) — so GC || FE. Therefore, since both GC and FE are perpendicular to AC, they are parallel. 

Additionally, Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)) — so AC ⊥ DF. And Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)) — so AC || DF. Wait, but AC and DF are both perpendicular to the same line (GC and FE)? Wait, no. AC is perpendicular to GC and FE. DF is parallel to AC. So DF is also perpendicular to GC and FE. 

But back to angle GCF being right. It's the angle at C between GC and CF. So lines GC and CF are perpendicular. But GC is perpendicular to AC, so CF must be parallel to AC? Because if GC ⊥ AC, and GC ⊥ CF, then CF is parallel to AC. 

Wait, that's the key! If GC is perpendicular to AC, and angle GCF is a right angle (so GC ⊥ CF), then CF is parallel to AC. 

Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So GC ⊥ AC and GC ⊥ CF ⇒ AC || CF. 

Ah! So CF is parallel to AC. Therefore, CF is parallel to AC. 

But AC is horizontal (as we assumed), so CF is also horizontal. Therefore, point F lies somewhere such that CF is horizontal. So if C is at (c,0), then F has the same y-coordinate as C, which is 0. Wait, but that would put F on the same horizontal line as AC. But then line AF connects A(0,0) to F(some point on y=0), so AF would be along AC. But then angle AFD would be... Well, let me think. 

Wait, if CF is horizontal, then F is on the line AC extended. Wait, but AC is from A(0,0) to C(c,0). So if CF is horizontal, then F is either to the right of C or to the left. Let's say F is to the right of C, so F is at (c + k, 0) for some k. Then line AF is from (0,0) to (c + k, 0), which is along the x-axis. Then line DF is parallel to AC, which is horizontal. So DF is horizontal. So D is somewhere on the same horizontal line as F. 

But then there's line FE, which is parallel to GC. Since GC is vertical (perpendicular to AC), FE is vertical. So FE is vertical. But F is on the x-axis (y=0). So FE is vertical line through F, which would be the line x = c + k. So E is somewhere along this vertical line. 

Also, angle FED is a right angle. So at point E, FE (vertical) and ED form a right angle. So ED must be horizontal. Therefore, D is horizontally aligned with E. Since E is on the vertical line through F, and ED is horizontal, then D is to the left or right of E along the horizontal line. 

But DF is horizontal, so D is on the same horizontal line as F. Therefore, E's y-coordinate is 0 (since F is at y=0, and ED is horizontal). Wait, but E is on the vertical line through F, so E has the same x-coordinate as F. So E is (c + k, 0). Then ED is horizontal, so D is (d_x, 0). But DF is horizontal, so D is on the same horizontal line as F, which is y=0. So D is (d_x, 0). 

So line CE connects C(c,0) to E(c + k, 0). Wait, but that would make CE horizontal, same as AC and CF. So CE is horizontal. But then angle at C between GC and CF is a right angle. GC is vertical (since it's perpendicular to AC), and CF is horizontal. Yes! So angle GCF is between vertical GC and horizontal CF, forming a right angle. Perfect, that resolves the earlier contradiction. 

So correcting earlier mistake: CF is horizontal, not vertical. Let me redo the coordinate setup. 

Let me reset coordinates. Let’s place A at (0,0), and AC as horizontal. Let’s say C is at (c, 0). Since CF is horizontal, F is at (f, 0) where f > c or f < c. Let's say f > c, so F is to the right of C. 

Now, since line GC is perpendicular to AC (which is horizontal), so GC is vertical. So G is vertically aligned with C. Let’s say G is at (c, g_y), so line GC is vertical from (c,0) to (c, g_y). 

Line FE is parallel to GC (which is vertical), so FE is vertical. Since F is at (f, 0), line FE is vertical through F, so E is at (f, e_y). 

Also, FE is perpendicular to AC (which is horizontal), which fits since FE is vertical. 

Now, angle FED is right. At point E, FE is vertical, so ED must be horizontal. Therefore, D is horizontally aligned with E. Since D is connected via DF (which is parallel to AC, i.e., horizontal), D is on the same horizontal line as F. So D is at (d_x, 0). 

So line DF connects D(d_x, 0) to F(f, 0), which is horizontal. 

Line CE connects C(c,0) to E(f, e_y). 

Now, we need to find angle AFD, which is the angle at F between AF and FD. 

Point A is (0,0), F is (f, 0), D is (d_x, 0). Wait, but if D is on the same horizontal line as F, then FD is from F(f, 0) to D(d_x, 0), which is along the x-axis. So angle AFD is the angle between AF (from F to A, which is from (f,0) to (0,0)) and FD (from F to D, which is along x-axis). 

But if both AF and FD are along the x-axis, then the angle between them is zero? That can't be. Something's wrong. 

Wait, no. AF is from A(0,0) to F(f,0), which is along the x-axis. FD is from F(f,0) to D(d_x, 0), which is also along the x-axis. So the angle between AF and FD is zero, which contradicts the existence of x. Clearly, there's a mistake in assumptions. 

What's wrong here? Let me trace back. 

If DF is parallel to AC, which is horizontal, so DF is horizontal. But F is on the x-axis (y=0), so D is on the same horizontal line. But then FD is along x-axis, making angle AFD zero. Not possible. So where is the error?

Earlier, I thought that CF is horizontal because it's parallel to AC. But AC is horizontal, so CF is parallel to AC, implying CF is horizontal. But then F is on the line AC extended, making AF and DF both along the x-axis. This leads to angle AFD being zero, which is impossible. 

This suggests a fundamental flaw in the setup. Perhaps my initial assumption about the direction of lines is incorrect. Let me revisit the perpendicular and parallel relationships. 

Given: 
- Perpendicular(Line(GC), Line(AC)) → GC ⊥ AC
- Perpendicular(Line(FE), Line(AC)) → FE ⊥ AC
- Parallel(Line(GC), Line(FE)) → GC || FE
- Parallel(Line(AC), Line(DF)) → AC || DF
- Perpendicular(Line(AC), Line(DF)) → AC ⊥ DF

Wait, this is contradictory. If AC is parallel to DF, and AC is perpendicular to DF, then this implies AC is both parallel and perpendicular to DF, which is only possible if AC and DF are zero-length lines, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, the predicates state: 
- Perpendicular(Line(AC), Line(DF)) 
- Parallel(Line(AC), Line(DF)) 

That can't both be true unless Line(AC) and Line(DF) are the same line, but they are different lines. So this is impossible. 

Wait, this must be a mistake in understanding the predicates. Let me double-check the original problem statement. 

Original predicates include: 
"Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"
"Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

These two cannot both be true unless the lines are identical, which they aren't. This suggests a contradiction, which means there's likely an error in interpreting the predicates. 

Wait, let me check again. The user wrote:

"Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

and 

"Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

These are contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the line DF is the same as line AC? No, because DF connects D to F, while AC connects A to C. Unless points are arranged such that these lines are the same, but that would require specific placements. 

But given that there's a right angle between AC and DF, and they are parallel, this is only possible if AC and DF are zero-length lines, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my misinterpretation. 

Wait, but the problem says "the diagram shows the layout of Elm, Plum, and Oak streets." Maybe the streets are intersecting in certain ways. Let me think differently. Perhaps the lines are not infinite, but segments. But even then, two lines can't be both parallel and perpendicular unless they are the same line. 

This suggests that the problem may have a typo, but assuming it's correctly given, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the predicates. 

Wait, the user listed:

- Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))
- Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))

These are contradictory. However, maybe it's a translation error, and one of them should be Perpendicular(Line(D,F), Line(AC))? Or maybe it's a different pair. Alternatively, perhaps one of the lines is not a line but a segment. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not Euclidean lines but something else. But assuming standard geometry, this seems impossible. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps there's a mistake in transcribing the problem. But since I have to work with the given info, let's proceed carefully. 

Assume that the intended meaning is that AC is perpendicular to DF, and AC is parallel to DF, which is only possible if DF is a degenerate line. Alternatively, perhaps one of the conditions is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second condition is Parallel(Line(D,F), Line(A,C)) and the first is Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)), which would imply that AC is both parallel and perpendicular to DF, which is only possible if AC and DF are zero-length lines. 

This seems like a critical inconsistency, but since the problem is given, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the lines are not straight lines but something else? Or perhaps one of the lines is not a line but a ray or segment. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Perpendicular and Parallel relationships refer to the segments, not the entire lines. For example, AC and DF are perpendicular as segments, and also parallel as segments. But this still requires them to be the same segment, which is not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misread in the predicates. Let me check again. 

Looking back at the original problem's predicates:

- "Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

- "Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

Yes, both are stated. This seems like a contradiction. Unless there's a misinterpretation of the terms. For instance, maybe "Line(A,C)" refers to a specific segment, and "Line(D,F)" is another segment, and they are both perpendicular and parallel, which is impossible. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to proceed, I'll assume that one of the conditions is different. Perhaps it's supposed to be Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(F,D))? Or Parallel(Line(F,D), Line(A,C))? 

Alternatively, perhaps the second condition is Parallel(Line(F,D), Line(A,C)), which would make sense if AC and DF are both perpendicular to FE and GC, as previously. 

Assuming that there was a mistake in the predicate, and the correct one is Parallel(Line(F,D), Line(A,C)), which would resolve the contradiction. Let's proceed under that assumption, as otherwise the problem is unsolvable. 

So assuming that the correct predicates are:

- Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)) → AC ⊥ DF

- Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)) → AC || DF

Which is only possible if AC and DF are the same line. But since DF is from D to F and AC is from A to C, this would require D and F to be on AC, extending it. 

Let me try this approach. Assume that line DF is the same as line AC. So D and F are on line AC. 

But then line DF would be AC itself, making them the same line. So D and F are points on AC. 

In this case, line AF is from A to F, which is part of AC. Line DF is AC. So angle AFD would be between AF (along AC) and FD (also along AC), making the angle zero. Again, impossible. 

This suggests that the problem has conflicting predicates, making it unsolvable. However, since the problem is presented, there must be a resolution. Let me reconsider the possibility that the Perpendicular and Parallel relationships are between different pairs. 

Wait, the original problem includes:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,C,F)): so angle at C between AC and CF is right.

- Perpendicular(Line(G,C), Line(A,C)): GC ⊥ AC

- Perpendicular(Line(F,E), Line(A,C)): FE ⊥ AC

- Parallel(Line(G,C), Line(F,E)): GC || FE

- Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)): AC || DF

- Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F)): AC ⊥ DF

This is contradictory. Unless one of the conditions is not present. Let me check the original problem again. 

The user wrote:

"Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

"Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(D,F))"

Yes, both are present. This is impossible unless the lines are the same. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the lines are not infinite, but segments, and the perpendicularity is at a particular point. For example, AC is perpendicular to DF at some point, and they are parallel. But this is still contradictory. 

At this point, given the time spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps I should focus on the given angles and relationships, ignoring the contradictory ones. 

We know that angle HGB is 55°, angle AFD is x, and several right angles. Also, there are parallel lines and perpendicular lines. 

Maybe focusing on the right angles and parallel lines to find relationships. 

Since GC is parallel to FE, and both are perpendicular to AC, so GC and FE are both vertical (if AC is horizontal). 

Also, AC is parallel to DF, and perpendicular to DF. This implies that AC and DF are the same line. So DF is AC. Hence, D and F are on AC. 

Let me assume that DF is the same as AC. So D and F are points on AC. Let's say F is between A and C, or outside. 

If F is on AC, then line AF is part of AC. Line DF is also AC. So angle AFD is between AF (part of AC) and FD (also part of AC), making it zero. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, if F is not on AC, but DF is parallel to AC and perpendicular to AC. This is impossible unless DF is zero-length. 

This suggests that the problem contains inconsistent predicates, making it unsolvable. However, since the answer choices exist, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the predicates. 

Let me try to focus on the given angles and relationships. 

We have three right angles: at GCF, at FED, and at ACF. 

Angle GCF is right: so GC ⊥ CF. 

Angle FED is right: FE ⊥ ED. 

Angle ACF is right: AC ⊥ CF. 

From this, since AC ⊥ CF and GC ⊥ CF, then AC || GC. 

Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. 

So AC || GC. 

Also, FE is parallel to GC (given), so FE || GC || AC. 

Thus, FE || AC. 

And FE is perpendicular to AC (given), so FE is perpendicular to AC, which is consistent with FE being parallel to GC, which is perpendicular to AC. 

Now, since AC || DF (parallel), and AC ⊥ FE, then DF is also perpendicular to FE. 

But FE is parallel to GC, so DF is perpendicular to GC. 

Also, since AC || DF, and AC ⊥ GC, then DF ⊥ GC. 

Now, let's consider triangle ACF, where angle at C is right. So AC ⊥ CF. 

Since AC || DF, and CF is connected to F, which is on DF? No, DF is parallel to AC, but F is a point. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. 

Since AC is parallel to DF, and AC ⊥ CF, then DF is also perpendicular to CF. So CF is perpendicular to both AC and DF. 

Thus, CF is perpendicular to AC and DF, making CF perpendicular to the line containing AC and DF. 

Now, since FE is parallel to GC, and GC is perpendicular to AC, FE is perpendicular to AC. 

Also, FE is perpendicular to AC, and AC is parallel to DF, so FE is perpendicular to DF. 

So FE ⊥ DF. 

Now, at point F, we have lines CF and DF. Since CF is perpendicular to DF, angle at F between CF and DF is right. 

But angle AFD is the angle at F between AF and DF. 

If I can find the relationship between AF and CF, and between AF and DF. 

Since CF is perpendicular to DF, and if I can find the angle between AF and CF, then angle AFD can be determined. 

Let me consider triangle AFC. Since AC ⊥ CF, triangle AFC is right-angled at C. 

So in triangle AFC, right-angled at C, with legs AC and CF, and hypotenuse AF. 

Now, angle at F in triangle AFC is angle AFC. 

But angle AFD is the angle between AF and DF. Since DF is parallel to AC, and CF is perpendicular to DF, then DF is parallel to AC, and CF is perpendicular to DF. 

So at point F, DF is parallel to AC, and CF is perpendicular to DF. 

Thus, the angle between CF and DF is 90 degrees. 

Now, let's consider the angle between AF and DF. 

Since DF is parallel to AC, and AF is the hypotenuse of the right triangle AFC. 

Let me denote angle AFD as x. In triangle AFC, angle at F is angle AFC. 

But how does angle AFD relate to angle AFC? 

If DF is parallel to AC, then the angle between AF and DF (which is x) is supplementary to the angle between AF and AC. 

Wait, since DF || AC, and AF is a transversal. The angle between AF and DF at F is equal to the angle between AF and AC at A, due to alternate interior angles. 

Wait, no, because DF is parallel to AC, and AF is a transversal. So the angle between AF and DF at F is equal to the angle between AF and AC at A. 

Wait, let me visualize: DF || AC, AF intersects both. So the angle between AF and DF at F is equal to the angle between AF and AC at A. 

Let me call angle at A as α. Then angle AFD = α. 

But in triangle AFC, right-angled at C, we have:

tan(angle at F, which is angle AFC) = AC / CF.

But angle AFD is x, and angle AFD is related to angle at A. 

Alternatively, since DF || AC, and AF is a transversal, then angle between AF and DF at F is equal to the angle between AF and AC at A. So x = angle at A. 

But we need to find x. 

However, we also have angle HGB = 55°, which might be related. 

Let me consider the other parts of the diagram. 

Angle HGB is at point G, between H, G, B. Given that GC is perpendicular to AC, and GC is parallel to FE, which is perpendicular to AC. 

Also, line BG connects B to G, and line GH connects G to H. 

If I can find relationships involving angle HGB = 55°, perhaps relating to other angles. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple right angles and parallel lines, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point or in a polygon. 

But given the time constraints, let me try to focus on what I can derive. 

In triangle AFC, right-angled at C, with angle at F being angle AFC. 

Since DF || AC, and angle AFD = x, which is equal to angle between AF and DF, which is equal to angle between AF and AC (due to parallel lines), which is angle at A in triangle AFC. 

Let me denote angle at A as α, so x = α. 

In triangle AFC, angle at C is 90°, angle at A is α, angle at F is 90° - α. 

But angle at F in triangle AFC is angle AFC = 90° - α. 

But angle AFD is x = α. 

Now, how to relate α to the given angle HGB = 55°? 

Perhaps by considering other triangles or relationships. 

Let me consider line BG and GH. Since GC is vertical (assuming AC is horizontal), and GC is part of line GC. Point G is on GC. Line BG connects B to G. Line GH connects G to H. Angle at G between H, G, B is 55°. 

If I can express this angle in terms of other angles. 

But without knowing the exact placement of B and H, it's hard to say. 

However, since GC is perpendicular to AC, and AC is parallel to DF, and DF is perpendicular to CF, which is perpendicular to AC. 

Maybe there's a way to link angle HGB with other angles. 

Alternatively, since there are three right angles and parallel lines, perhaps the diagram forms a rectangle or parallelogram. 

Alternatively, considering that FE is parallel to GC, and GC is perpendicular to AC, so FE is perpendicular to AC. Also, FE is perpendicular to AC, and AC is parallel to DF, so FE is perpendicular to DF. 

At point F, we have FE perpendicular to DF, and CF perpendicular to DF. So FE and CF are both perpendicular to DF, hence FE || CF. 

But FE is parallel to GC, and CF is connected to C. 

If FE || CF, then since FE is parallel to GC, then GC || CF. But earlier, we have GC ⊥ AC and CF ⊥ AC, so GC || CF. 

This implies that GC and CF are parallel and both perpendicular to AC, which makes them parallel to each other. 

But this is consistent. 

Now, since FE || CF, and FE is perpendicular to DF, and CF is perpendicular to DF, this holds. 

Now, returning to angle AFD = x. 

If I can find the relationship between x and the given 55° angle. 

Let me assume that angle HGB = 55° is part of a triangle or quadrilateral that relates to x. 

For example, if line BG is connected to G, which is on GC, and H is some point such that GH forms angle 55° with GB. 

Without more information, it's difficult to proceed, but perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle or around a point. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple right angles, perhaps the diagram involves a series of right triangles and parallel lines creating supplementary or complementary angles. 

Given that angle HGB is 55°, and possibly forming a triangle with other angles. 

If I assume that triangle HGB is part of a larger structure, and using the parallel lines to find corresponding angles. 

But without concrete details, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since there are three right angles, and one given angle of 55°, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles in a polygon or around a point. 

Alternatively, since angle AFD is x, and there are other angles that add up to 180° or 360°, leading to x being 180° - 55° - ... 

But this is too vague. 

Given the time I've invested and the need to arrive at an answer, I'll proceed with the earlier relation in triangle AFC. 

In triangle AFC, right-angled at C, angle at F is 90° - α, where α is angle at A, which is equal to x (angle AFD). 

So, 90° - α = angle AFC. 

But what is angle AFC? It's the angle at F between AF and FC. 

But we also have line FE, which is parallel to GC, and FE is perpendicular to AC. 

Since FE is perpendicular to AC, and AC is parallel to DF, FE is perpendicular to DF. 

At point F, FE is perpendicular to DF, and CF is also perpendicular to DF. Hence, FE and CF are parallel (both perpendicular to DF). 

So, FE || CF. 

Since FE is parallel to GC, then GC || CF. 

But GC is perpendicular to AC, so CF is perpendicular to AC. 

This confirms earlier findings. 

Now, at point F, we have line FE (parallel to GC) and line CF. 

Since FE is parallel to GC, and GC is perpendicular to AC, then FE is perpendicular to AC. 

But AC is parallel to DF, so FE is perpendicular to DF. 

Thus, at point F, FE is perpendicular to DF, and CF is also perpendicular to DF, so FE and CF are parallel. 

Now, let's consider the angle between AF and FE. 

Since FE is perpendicular to AC, and AF is a line from A to F, the angle between AF and FE is complementary to angle between AF and AC. 

But this might not directly help. 

Let me return to triangle AFC, right-angled at C. 

If I can find the measure of angle at F, which is
