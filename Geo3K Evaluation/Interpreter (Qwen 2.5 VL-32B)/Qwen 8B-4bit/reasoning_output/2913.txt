<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D. There are several lines mentioned: AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. Also, there's a right angle at angle ABC, which is part of triangle ABC. Let me start by breaking down the given information step by step.

First, the Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) means that these four points form a quadrilateral. Then, each of A, B, C, D is a Point. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the quadrilateral, and BD is a diagonal connecting B to D. 

Now, looking at the predicates about angles and right angles. The Angle(A,B,C) is given, and it's stated that RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)). That means angle ABC is a right angle. Additionally, there's a Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) predicate, so triangle ABC is a right triangle. 

We also know some lengths: LengthOf(AB) is 14 units, LengthOf(BC) is 10 units, and LengthOf(CD) is x, which we need to find. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) confirms that AB is perpendicular to BC, which aligns with angle ABC being a right angle.

Then, there's IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)) and IsSideOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)), meaning AB and BC are sides of triangle ABC. And IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) tells us that AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. Since ABC is a right triangle with legs AB=14 and BC=10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC.

Calculating AC: sqrt(14² + 10²) = sqrt(196 + 100) = sqrt(296). Simplify sqrt(296): 296 factors into 4*74, so sqrt(4*74)=2√74. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. 14 squared is 196, 10 squared is 100; sum is 296. Yes, so AC = √296. But perhaps simplifying further? 296 divided by 4 is 74, so yes, 2√74. Hmm, but I don't see how this connects directly to finding x yet.

Wait, the quadrilateral ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA, and diagonal BD. We need to find CD's length, which is x. But how?

Let me think about the structure. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, maybe it's a trapezoid or another type. However, since AB is perpendicular to BC, and if we consider BD as a diagonal, perhaps triangle ABD or CBD could be involved?

Alternatively, maybe ABCD is a rectangle? But no, because AB and BC are perpendicular, but CD would need to be equal to AB if it were a rectangle. But CD is x, which is unknown. However, given that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB and BC perpendicular, but without more info, maybe it's a kite or something else.

Wait, but there's also the line BD. Since BD is connected from B to D, and we have points A, B, C, D forming a quadrilateral. Maybe considering coordinates would help here. Assign coordinates to points and calculate distances?

Yes, coordinate geometry might be a good approach. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's place point B at the origin (0,0) because angle at B is a right angle. Then, since AB is horizontal and BC is vertical. Let me define:

- Point B is at (0,0).
- Since AB is length 14, and assuming AB is horizontal, point A would be at (-14, 0) or (14,0). Wait, but direction matters. Since AB is connected to BC, which goes from B to C. Let me choose coordinates such that AB is along the x-axis and BC is along the y-axis.

So, point B is at (0,0). Let me take AB as going from B(0,0) to A(14,0) since AB length is 14. Then BC is perpendicular to AB, so it goes upward from B(0,0) along the y-axis. Since BC is length 10, point C would be at (0,10).

Now, point D is part of the quadrilateral. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So from point C(0,10), we go to D, then back to A(14,0). So CD connects C(0,10) to D, and DA connects D to A(14,0). Also, BD is a diagonal from B(0,0) to D.

But where is D located? To find coordinates of D, perhaps we need more constraints. Wait, but we have the line BD. Since BD is a line from B(0,0) to D. Also, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the order of the points should be A-B-C-D-A. So, moving from A(14,0) to B(0,0) to C(0,10) to D to A(14,0). Therefore, D is connected to C(0,10) and to A(14,0). So, point D lies somewhere such that CD connects to it and DA connects back to A.

But how do we find coordinates of D? Maybe using the fact that BD is a line. Wait, but we don't have any direct information about BD except that it's present. Unless there's another condition. Wait, but maybe triangle ABD or triangle BCD has some properties?

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, perhaps it's a parallelogram? No, because AB is 14 and BC is 10, so unless AD equals BC and DC equals AB, but we don't know. Alternatively, maybe it's a right trapezoid? Because AB is perpendicular to BC, so if AD is parallel to BC, making a right trapezoid. But we don't know that. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD relates to something? Not sure yet. Wait, but we need to find CD's length. Let me think. Coordinates might still work. Let me proceed with coordinates.

Assuming coordinates:

A(14,0), B(0,0), C(0,10). Now, point D(x,y) needs to satisfy that CD connects to D and DA connects back to A. Also, BD is a line from B(0,0) to D(x,y).

But how to find D? Are there any other conditions? Let's check the given predicates again. The only other thing is that Line(D,A) is a side. So DA is a line from D to A(14,0). Also, Line(C,D) connects C(0,10) to D(x,y). So we need more equations to find D's coordinates. But how?

Wait, maybe there's a relationship involving the diagonals or something else. Wait, the problem mentions that BD is a line, but no other properties. Unless there's another right angle or something. Wait, but the only right angle mentioned is at B in triangle ABC.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD or triangle BCD has some properties. For example, if ABCD is a rectangle, but then AD would be equal to BC (which is 10), but that's not necessarily the case here. Alternatively, if ABCD is a kite, but again, not sure.

Wait, but perhaps there's another right triangle involved. Let me think. Suppose we look at triangle BCD. If we can find some relations there. But we don't know any angles or sides except BC=10 and CD=x. But without more info, it's hard.

Wait, but maybe BD is the diagonal, and we can relate it with other parts. Let me think. In triangle ABD, we have points A(14,0), B(0,0), D(x,y). Similarly, in triangle BCD, points B(0,0), C(0,10), D(x,y). 

But how to connect them? Maybe express coordinates of D in terms of variables and find relations. Let me attempt that.

Let’s denote D as (p, q). Then, since DA connects D(p,q) to A(14,0), and CD connects C(0,10) to D(p,q). So, the coordinates of D are unknown, but we can write equations based on the lines. However, without more info, like slopes or other lengths, it seems underdetermined. Unless there's an assumption about the shape of the quadrilateral?

Wait, but the problem says it's a quadrilateral, but doesn't specify it's convex or anything. Maybe there's another right angle or something? Let me check the given predicates again. The only right angle is Angle(A,B,C), which is already used. Are there any other right angles implied? Like, maybe angle ADC or something?

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB ⊥ BC, and maybe AD ⊥ CD? Not sure. Without more info, this approach may not work.

Wait, but there's another predicate: IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). Which we've already used to confirm that AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. But that's already accounted for in our calculation earlier.

Hmm. Maybe we need to consider triangle ABD or triangle CBD. Wait, but without knowing angles or other sides, not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps the quadrilateral is cyclic? But there's no mention of that. Or maybe it's a right quadrilateral? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we need to use vectors or coordinate geometry to express relationships. Let me try again with coordinates.

Points:

A(14,0)

B(0,0)

C(0,10)

D(p,q)

Now, CD is from C(0,10) to D(p,q). The length CD is x, so sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (q - 10)^2] = x.

DA is from D(p,q) to A(14,0), so sqrt[(14 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2].

Also, BD is from B(0,0) to D(p,q), so its length is sqrt[p^2 + q^2]. But we don't have any info about BD's length.

However, maybe there's another relation. Wait, the problem didn't state that ABCD is a parallelogram or any other specific type. So maybe we need another equation. Perhaps the slope of DA and CD? Or something else?

Wait, but the problem gives that Line(B,D) exists, but no other info. Unless there's an implicit assumption that ABCD is closed properly, but that's already considered by connecting the points.

Wait, maybe there's another right angle? For instance, if angle at D is a right angle? But that's not given. Or maybe angle at A or C?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD or CBD is also a right triangle? Not specified.

This seems stuck. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), and Line(B,D) exist. So, ABCD is a quadrilateral with diagonal BD. But that's all. No other info. How can we find x?

Wait, but the problem includes the predicate Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)), which we've already used. Also, the Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) which we used to compute AC.

Wait, but maybe the key is that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB and BC perpendicular, and BD is a diagonal. Maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in some way involving BD?

Wait, suppose we consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates of D can be found via some property. For example, if ABCD is a rectangle, then D would be at (14,10), making CD length 14, but that's not one of the options. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe D lies somewhere such that BD is the hypotenuse of some right triangle? Or maybe ABCD is a kite?

Wait, if ABCD is a kite with AB=AD and CB=CD, but AB is 14, so AD would be 14, but CD is x. Then x would be equal to CB which is 10. But that would make x=10, which isn't among the options either. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe ABCD is a right trapezoid with AB and CD being the two bases. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, then if CD is also perpendicular to BC, making it a rectangle. But then CD would be equal to AB, which is 14, again not matching options.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me recall that in the problem, they mention that Line(B,D) exists. So BD is a diagonal. But how does that help?

Wait, maybe triangle ABD and triangle CBD share BD. But without more info, not helpful.

Wait, but what if we consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD? For example, if we can find some relations between them. Let me think.

Alternatively, since we know AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, and perhaps AC is related to BD somehow? For example, if ABCD is a rectangle, but again, not sure.

Wait, maybe there's a way to express coordinates of D in terms of other variables. Let me try again with coordinates.

From earlier:

A(14,0), B(0,0), C(0,10), D(p,q).

We need to find x = length of CD, which is sqrt((p-0)^2 + (q-10)^2) = sqrt(p² + (q-10)²).

But we need to find p and q. How?

Maybe there's a relation involving the diagonal BD. But without knowing its length or any angles, how?

Wait, but perhaps ABCD is a parallelogram? If so, then vector AB would equal vector DC. Vector AB is (14,0) - (0,0) = (14,0). Vector DC would be C - D = (0,10) - (p,q) = (-p, 10 - q). Setting equal to AB: (14,0) = (-p, 10 - q). So, -p =14 → p=-14, and 10 - q=0 → q=10. So D would be (-14,10). Then CD would be distance from C(0,10) to D(-14,10): sqrt[(-14-0)^2 + (10-10)^2] = sqrt(196+0) =14. But this would make x=14, which isn't among the options. Also, this assumes ABCD is a parallelogram, which isn't stated. So maybe that's incorrect.

Alternatively, if ABCD is a rhombus, but again, no basis for that assumption.

Another thought: Maybe triangle ABD is right-angled? Or some other triangle?

Wait, let me check if there's any other right angles in the diagram. The only right angle explicitly given is at B. Are there others?

If we assume that angle at D is a right angle, then angle ADC would be 90 degrees, making ABCD a right quadrilateral. But again, that's an assumption not supported by the given data.

Alternatively, since BD is a diagonal, and if it forms a right angle with something... Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is that triangle ABC is right-angled, and we can use coordinates to find D such that ABCD closes properly. But how?

Wait, let's think about the entire quadrilateral. From point A(14,0) to B(0,0) to C(0,10) to D(p,q) to A(14,0). So, the position of D depends on how the quadrilateral is shaped. Without more info, it's impossible to determine. So there must be something I missed.

Wait, going back to the initial list of predicates: Are there any other relationships? Let me check again.

Given:

- Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)

- Points A, B, C, D.

- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA, BD.

- Angle at B is right angle.

- RightTriangle ABC.

- Lengths AB=14, BC=10, CD=x.

- Perpendicularity of AB and BC.

- Sides AB and BC are part of triangle ABC.

- Hypotenuse AC of triangle ABC.

Wait, maybe triangle ABD or triangle BCD has some properties. Let's think about triangle BCD. It has side BC=10, CD=x, and BD. But we don't know BD or any angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD: AB=14, AD=?, BD=?. Still not enough.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between AC and BD? For example, in some cases, diagonals intersect at certain ratios, but without knowing if they bisect each other, etc., it's unclear.

Wait, but maybe applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD or BCD. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's challenging.

Wait, here's an idea! Maybe using coordinates and expressing DA in terms of D's coordinates. Let me try that.

We have point D(p,q). DA connects D(p,q) to A(14,0), so the length DA is sqrt[(14-p)^2 + (0-q)^2]. Also, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. But there's no constraint on DA's length, so we can't determine p and q uniquely. Thus, there must be another condition I haven't considered.

Wait, but wait—what about the line BD? Does it have any special property? The problem states that Line(B,D) exists, but no other info. So unless there's an implicit assumption that ABCD is convex or something else, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral implies that the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are connected sequentially, but that's already assumed.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently. What if I consider the possibility that ABCD is a right triangle extended? Or perhaps triangle ABD is right-angled?

Wait, if we assume that angle at D is right, then AD ⊥ CD. Let me explore this. Assume angle ADC is 90 degrees. Then, in triangle ADC, AD and CD are perpendicular. But how to verify this?

If that's the case, then using coordinates:

Point D(p,q). AD is from A(14,0) to D(p,q), and CD is from C(0,10) to D(p,q). The vectors AD and CD would be perpendicular.

Vector AD = (p -14, q - 0) = (p-14, q)

Vector CD = (p - 0, q - 10) = (p, q-10)

Their dot product should be zero if they're perpendicular:

(p-14)*p + q*(q-10) = 0

=> p(p-14) + q(q-10) = 0

That's one equation. Also, we know that CD's length is x = sqrt(p² + (q-10)^2). But we need another equation to solve for p and q.

But we don't have another equation unless we make assumptions. Wait, but what about the line BD? Is there any condition on it?

If we assume that ABCD is a rectangle, then angle at D would be 90 degrees, but that leads to x=14 as before, which isn't an option. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if we assume that BD is the altitude or median, but without knowing, it's guesswork.

Wait, maybe there's another right angle in triangle ABD or BCD. For example, if angle ABD is right, then AB ⊥ BD. But AB is horizontal (from (0,0) to (14,0)), so BD would need to be vertical. That would mean D lies on the y-axis. Let me explore that.

If BD is vertical, then D has the same x-coordinate as B, which is 0. So D would be (0, q). Then CD connects C(0,10) to D(0,q), so CD is vertical, length |q - 10|. DA connects D(0,q) to A(14,0), so length sqrt(14² + q²). But then, what's x? CD length is |q - 10|. But we don't know q. However, since D is (0,q), BD is from (0,0) to (0,q), so length |q|.

But how to find q? Maybe using the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral. Since D is (0,q), then CD is from (0,10) to (0,q), and DA is from (0,q) to (14,0). But without more info, q could be any value. Hence, this approach doesn't yield x.

Hmm. Maybe this is leading nowhere. Let me revisit the original problem.

Wait, the problem gives that Line(B,D) exists. But maybe there's a relationship between AC and BD? For instance, in some configurations, diagonals intersect at certain angles or have specific lengths. But without knowing if they're perpendicular or anything, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thought: Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB ⊥ BC, and we know AB=14, BC=10, and want CD=x. Maybe ABCD is a right triangle extended? Like, extending BC to form CD?

No, CD is a side, not an extension.

Wait, perhaps the key lies in recognizing that triangle ABD and triangle BCD are related through BD. Let me try to express BD in terms of other quantities.

In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, which we calculated as sqrt(14² + 10²) = sqrt(296) = 2√74.

Now, in quadrilateral ABCD, diagonals AC and BD. If there's a relationship between them, like being perpendicular or something. But the problem doesn't mention that.

Wait, but if we consider the area of ABCD. Since ABC is a right triangle with area (14*10)/2 = 70. If ABCD is composed of ABC and another triangle or something. But without knowing the shape, it's hard to say.

Wait, but if ABCD is a right trapezoid with AB and CD as the two bases, and BC and AD as legs. Wait, but BC is a leg of the right angle. If it's a right trapezoid, then AD would be parallel to BC. Since BC is vertical (from earlier coordinate setup), AD would also be vertical. So point D would have the same x-coordinate as A, which is 14. So D would be (14, q). Then CD would be from C(0,10) to D(14,q). Length CD would be sqrt((14-0)^2 + (q-10)^2) = sqrt(196 + (q-10)^2). But DA is from D(14,q) to A(14,0), which is vertical line of length |q|. 

But in this case, the trapezoid would have AB and CD as the two bases. But we don't know the height. However, since BC is one of the legs, which is length 10. In a right trapezoid, the height would be BC=10. So the height is 10, which would mean the distance between AB and CD is 10. Since AB is horizontal at y=0, then CD would be at y=10. So point D would be (14,10), making CD length sqrt(14² + 0) = 14. But again, this gives x=14, which isn't an option. So this suggests my assumption is wrong.

But why am I getting x=14? Maybe the trapezoid isn't right-trapped in this way. Maybe it's not a right trapezoid.

At this point, I feel like I'm missing a key insight. Let me try to think of all given data and see if there's a connection I overlooked.

We have:

- Triangle ABC is right-angled at B, with AB=14, BC=10, AC=sqrt(296).

- Need to find CD=x.

- ABCD is a quadrilateral with sides AB, BC, CD, DA, and diagonal BD.

- All given lines are AB, BC, CD, DA, BD.

Wait, perhaps ABCD is a rectangle? No, because AB=14, BC=10, so AD should be 10 and CD=14, but again, not matching options.

Wait, but maybe ABCD is a different kind of quadrilateral. Let me try to use coordinates again, but this time, assume that D lies somewhere such that BD is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with AB and BC?

Wait, no. Or maybe triangle ABD is similar to triangle ABC?

Not sure. Let me try to set up equations.

Let me assume that D lies somewhere such that BD is a line, and CD is x. But without more info, I can't find x.

Wait, but maybe the key is that ABCD is a rectangle? No, as discussed. Or maybe it's a square? No.

Wait, what if ABCD is a kite with AB=AD and BC=CD? If AB=AD=14, then AD=14. So from point A(14,0), D would be somewhere such that distance from A to D is 14. Also, BC=CD=10. So CD=10, which would mean x=10. But 10 isn't an option either. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if AB=BC=14 and 10, but no.

Wait, maybe the problem involves using the Pythagorean theorem in a different triangle. Let me think. For example, if we consider triangle ABD, where AB=14, BD=?, AD=?, and triangle BCD, where BC=10, BD=?, CD=x. But without knowing BD or other sides, it's difficult.

Wait, but if we assume that ABCD is a right triangle? No, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, here's a new idea: Maybe triangle ABD is a right triangle. Suppose angle at B is right, making AB ⊥ BD. But AB is already perpendicular to BC. If BD is also perpendicular to AB, then BD would be along BC. But that would mean D lies on BC, making CD=BC - BD, but not sure.

Let me explore this. If BD is perpendicular to AB, then BD is vertical (since AB is horizontal). So D would be along the vertical line passing through B(0,0), so D is (0, k). Then CD is from C(0,10) to D(0,k), so length |k-10|. DA is from D(0,k) to A(14,0), length sqrt(14² + k²). But we don't know k. However, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the side DA connects to A(14,0). But how does this help us find k? There's no additional info.

Unless there's another condition. For example, if angle at D is right, but that's an assumption.

Alternatively, if ABCD is a rectangle, but that leads to x=14.

This is frustrating. I must be missing something. Let me review all given predicates once more.

Wait, the problem states that Line(B,D) exists. So BD is a line. But what about the other lines? We have AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. So ABCD is a quadrilateral with a diagonal BD. So the full set of lines is AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD.

But maybe there's a relationship between the diagonals? Like, in some quadrilaterals, the diagonals are perpendicular or something. But again, no info.

Wait, but what if we consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD? Let's say that BD is a common side. If we can find expressions for AB, AD, BD in one triangle and BC, CD, BD in another, but without knowing any angles or other sides, it's still underdetermined.

Wait, but what if we assume that ABCD is a rectangle? Even though earlier calculations suggested x=14, which isn't an option, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB=CD=14 and BC=AD=10. So x=CD=14, but this isn't an option. So no.

Wait, but the answer choices include options like 4√2, 4√3, 8, 4√6. None of these are 14. So maybe the correct answer is none of these, but that's not possible. Hence, my previous approaches are wrong.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that in triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, length sqrt(14² + 10²) = sqrt(196 + 100) = sqrt(296) = 2√74. Now, if ABCD is a quadrilateral, and we need to find CD=x. Maybe there's a relationship between AC and CD?

Wait, if ABCD is a right triangle, but it's a quadrilateral. No, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines in some triangle? For example, if we can find an angle relating to CD.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonal BD creates two right triangles, one with AB and BC, and another with CD and something else?

Wait, if I consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD, and if they are similar or have some ratio.

Wait, but without knowing any angles or other sides, it's impossible.

Wait, let me think about the possibility that ABCD is a right triangle with right angle at D. If angle at D is 90 degrees, then AD ⊥ CD. Let's explore this.

Assume angle ADC is 90 degrees. Then, in triangle ADC, AD and CD are perpendicular. Using coordinates:

Point D(p,q). AD vector is (p-14, q), CD vector is (p, q-10). Their dot product is (p-14)p + q(q-10) = 0.

Expand this: p² -14p + q² -10q = 0.

Also, we know that CD's length is x = sqrt(p² + (q-10)^2).

But we need another equation to solve for p and q. Let's think: what other condition do we have? The line BD exists, but no other info. However, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the side DA connects D to A, and DA is part of the quadrilateral. But without more conditions, this equation alone is insufficient.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between AB and CD? Or between BC and DA? Not directly given.

Wait, but maybe the diagonals AC and BD intersect at some point, but without knowing that, it's hard.

Alternatively, if we assume that the diagonals are perpendicular? Let me try that. If AC ⊥ BD, then their slopes multiply to -1.

AC is from A(14,0) to C(0,10), so slope is (10-0)/(0-14) = 10/-14 = -5/7.

BD is from B(0,0) to D(p,q), so slope is q/p.

For them to be perpendicular, (-5/7)*(q/p) = -1 → q/p = 7/5 → q = (7/5)p.

So now we have q = (7/5)p.

Substituting into the previous equation from the dot product: p² -14p + q² -10q = 0.

Replace q with (7/5)p:

p² -14p + [(7/5)p]^2 -10*(7/5)p = 0

Calculate each term:

p² -14p + (49/25)p² - 14p = 0

Combine like terms:

p² + (49/25)p² -14p -14p = 0

Convert to common denominator:

(25/25)p² + (49/25)p² = 74/25 p²

-14p -14p = -28p

So equation becomes:

74/25 p² -28p = 0

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate fraction:

74p² - 700p = 0

Factor:

p(74p - 700) = 0

Solutions: p=0 or p=700/74 = 350/37 ≈ 9.459...

If p=0, then q=0, which would make D coincide with B, which isn't possible. So p=350/37.

Thus, q = (7/5)*(350/37) = (7*350)/(5*37) = (7*70)/37 = 490/37.

Now, CD is from C(0,10) to D(350/37, 490/37). Let's calculate x = length CD.

x = sqrt[(350/37 - 0)^2 + (490/37 - 10)^2]

First, calculate 490/37 - 10 = 490/37 - 370/37 = 120/37.

So x = sqrt[(350/37)^2 + (120/37)^2] = sqrt[(350² + 120²)/37²] = sqrt(350² + 120²)/37.

Compute 350²: 122500

120²: 14400

Sum: 122500 + 14400 = 136900

sqrt(136900) = 370.

So x = 370 / 37 = 10.

But x=10 is not one of the options. Wait, but this contradicts the answer choices. So this approach also leads to x=10, which isn't listed. So either this assumption is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for x.

350² is indeed 122500, 120² is 14400. Sum is 136900. sqrt(136900) is 370. Divided by 37 gives 10. Correct. So x=10. But this isn't an option. So this suggests that the assumption that AC ⊥ BD is incorrect.

But why did this happen? Maybe the assumption that AC ⊥ BD is wrong. But where else to go?

This indicates that my approach is flawed. Let me think again.

Perhaps the key is that ABCD is a right triangle with AB and BC as legs, and CD is part of the hypotenuse? No, CD is a side.

Wait, let me try to think about the problem from scratch. Given that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB=14, BC=10, right angle at B, and needing to find CD=x. What's the missing piece?

Wait, perhaps ABCD is a rectangle? No, because then CD=AB=14, but no option. Or maybe it's a different shape.

Wait, what if ABCD is a square? No, since sides are 14 and 10.

Wait, here's a new idea: Maybe ABCD is a right triangle with AB and BC as legs, and CD as the third side, forming a larger right triangle? No, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe triangle ABD is a right triangle? If angle at B is right, then AB ⊥ BD. Let's assume that. So BD is perpendicular to AB, which is horizontal, so BD is vertical. So D has x-coordinate 0. So D is (0, q). Then CD is from C(0,10) to D(0,q), length |q-10|. DA is from D(0,q) to A(14,0), length sqrt(14² + q²). But we need to find q.

But how? There's no other condition. Unless there's a relationship between DA and other sides. But without more info, it's impossible.

Wait, but maybe DA is equal to BC? If DA=BC=10, then sqrt(14² + q²) = 10 → 196 + q² = 100 → q² = -96, which is impossible. So no.

Alternatively, if DA is equal to AB=14, then sqrt(14² + q²) = 14 → q=0, which makes D=B, invalid.

So this approach also fails.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the answer choices. The options are 4√2, 4√3, 8, 4√6. These suggest that x is likely a simplified radical expression. Let me consider if there's a way to get x=4√6.

For example, if in some right triangle, the sides are 14, 10, and x, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, but maybe using the Pythagorean theorem in a different way. Let me think: In triangle ABC, AC is sqrt(14² + 10²) = sqrt(296) = 2√74. Now, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AC would be the diagonal, but that's not helpful.

Wait, but if ABCD is a parallelogram, then AC and BD are diagonals, and in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. But since we don't know BD, it's not helpful.

Wait, let me try this formula: In any parallelogram, AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²). But we don't know if it's a parallelogram, but let's assume it for a moment. Then, AC² + BD² = 2(14² + 10²) = 2(196 + 100) = 2*296 = 592.

We know AC² is 296, so BD² = 592 - 296 = 296. So BD = sqrt(296) = 2√74. But how does this help us find x?

If ABCD is a parallelogram, then CD = AB = 14, but again, not matching options.

Alternatively, if it's a different type of quadrilateral, like a kite, but no.

Wait, but if ABCD is a kite with AB=AD and BC=CD. Then AB=AD=14, so AD=14. Then CD=BC=10, so x=10. Again, not an option.

This suggests that none of the standard quadrilaterals fit, so maybe the problem involves a different configuration.

Wait, let me revisit the coordinate approach with the assumption that ABCD is a right triangle with AB and BC as legs, and CD as a hypotenuse of another right triangle. For example, if angle at D is right, making ADC a right triangle.

Earlier, I had the equation from the dot product: p² -14p + q² -10q = 0.

And x = sqrt(p² + (q-10)^2).

Let me expand x²: p² + (q-10)^2 = p² + q² - 20q + 100.

From the equation p² + q² = 14p + 10q (from rearranging the dot product equation: p² + q² = 14p + 10q).

Substitute into x²: (14p + 10q) - 20q + 100 = 14p -10q + 100.

So x² = 14p -10q + 100.

But we need to find x, so we need to find 14p -10q.

But how? We need another equation.

Wait, but we also know that D lies on the line DA. Wait, DA is from D(p,q) to A(14,0). But without more info, this doesn't help.

Wait, but what if we consider the line BD? It goes from B(0,0) to D(p,q). Maybe there's a relationship between BD and other elements?

But without additional info, I can't find it.

Wait, but what if we assume that the line BD is the same as AC? No, because AC is from A(14,0) to C(0,10), while BD is from B(0,0) to D(p,q). They would only overlap if D is on AC. Let's try that.

If D lies on AC, then D is a point on the line from A(14,0) to C(0,10). Parametric equations: x = 14 -14t, y = 0 + 10t, where t ∈ [0,1].

So D would be (14(1-t), 10t).

Then, CD is from C(0,10) to D(14(1-t), 10t). Let's calculate x = CD length.

Coordinates of C: (0,10), D: (14(1-t), 10t).

Difference in x: 14(1-t) - 0 = 14(1-t)

Difference in y: 10t - 10 = 10(t-1)

So x = sqrt[ (14(1-t))^2 + (10(t-1))^2 ] = sqrt[ 196(1-t)^2 + 100(1-t)^2 ] = sqrt[296(1-t)^2] = sqrt(296)|1-t|

Since t is between 0 and 1, 1-t is positive, so x = sqrt(296)(1-t).

But what is t? It depends on where D is on AC. But we need to determine t.

But how? Maybe there's another condition. For example, if D is such that BD is a certain length, or some other property.

But the problem doesn't provide any such info. So this approach is also stuck.

Wait, but if D is on AC, then ABCD would be a degenerate quadrilateral, as D would lie on AC, making ABCD collapse. So this is unlikely.

After trying various approaches without success, I'm starting to think that maybe I need to revisit the original problem and see if there's a misinterpretation of the given predicates.

Re-reading the predicates:

- Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D): So ABCD is a quadrilateral.

- Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(B,D): So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, and diagonal BD.

- Angle(A,B,C) is right angle.

- Right(Triangle(A,B,C)): Confirms triangle ABC is right-angled at B.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 14): AB=14.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 10): BC=10.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), x): CD=x.

- Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)): AB ⊥ BC, confirming right angle at B.

- IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)): AB is a side of triangle ABC.

- IsSideOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)): BC is a side of triangle ABC.

- IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)): AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC.

So, all this confirms that triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs 14 and 10, hypotenuse AC=√(14² + 10²) = √296 = 2√74.

Now, the question is to find x = CD.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the key is to recognize that ABCD is a right triangle with AB and BC as legs, and CD is part of a larger right triangle. For example, if we extend BC to form a right triangle with CD.

Wait, but CD is a side of the quadrilateral. Let me imagine extending BC beyond C to a point E such that CE = CD, making BE = BC + CD = 10 + x. But this is pure speculation.

Alternatively, if ABCD is a right triangle with AB and BC as legs, and CD as a leg, making a larger right triangle. But I don't see how
