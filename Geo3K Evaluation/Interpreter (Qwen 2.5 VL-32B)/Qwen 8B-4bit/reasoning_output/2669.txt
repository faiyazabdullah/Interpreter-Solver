MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. Let me list them out again:

- Line(D,E)
- Line(E,F)
- Line(A,F)
- Point(D)
- Point(E)
- Point(F)
- Point(A)
- RightAngle(Angle(A,F,E))
- Parallel(Line(D,E), Line(E,F))
- Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(D,E))
- Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(E,F))

So, there are points D, E, F, and A. Lines connecting them: DE, EF, AF. Also, some perpendicularity and parallelism conditions. The question is to find x, but wait—the problem didn't specify what x represents. Hmm, maybe there was a diagram or more context missing? Wait, looking back at the original problem statement, perhaps x refers to an angle measure? Since the answer choices are degrees like 45, 90, etc., it's likely about an angle.

Wait, the given RightAngle(Angle(A,F,E))—so angle at point F between points A, F, E is a right angle. Also, Line(D,E) is parallel to Line(E,F). And Line(A,F) is perpendicular to both Line(D,E) and Line(E,F). So, let's try to visualize this.

First, draw points D, E, F. Line DE is parallel to line EF. But if DE is parallel to EF, then points D, E, F must be arranged such that DE and EF are two sides of a shape. However, since they're parallel, that suggests that DE and EF are part of a parallelogram? Or maybe a transversal?

But also, Line AF is perpendicular to both DE and EF. So AF is perpendicular to both lines. That would mean that AF is perpendicular to DE and EF, so AF is perpendicular to both, implying that DE and EF are parallel and AF is a common perpendicular. Wait, but if DE and EF are parallel, then AF being perpendicular to both would mean that AF is perpendicular to the direction of DE and EF. 

Let me think. Suppose we have two parallel lines, DE and EF. Wait, but if DE and EF are both lines starting at E, then they would form an angle at E. But if they are parallel, then the angle between them should be zero? That doesn't make sense unless they are overlapping. Wait, that can't be. So maybe there's a mistake here? Because Line(D,E) and Line(E,F) are two different lines meeting at E. For them to be parallel, they must be colinear? But that would mean points D, E, F are colinear, making DE and EF parts of the same line. But then how can AF be perpendicular to both? Because if DE and EF are the same line, then AF is perpendicular to that line. Then, angle at F between A-F-E would be... Wait, but if D-E-F are colinear, then E is between D and F. Then AF is perpendicular to DE (and hence to EF). So point A is somewhere off the line DF, forming a right angle at F between AFE. 

But also, there's another condition: Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(E,F)). Wait, Line(AF) is perpendicular to Line(EF). Which we already considered. But also, Line(AF) is perpendicular to Line(DE). So AF is perpendicular to both DE and EF, which are parallel. Therefore, AF is perpendicular to the entire plane of DE and EF. 

Now, considering the right angle at AFE: Angle(A,F,E) is a right angle. So triangle AFE is a right triangle with right angle at F. 

Since AF is perpendicular to EF, and EF is parallel to DE, then AF is also perpendicular to DE. Therefore, AF is perpendicular to both DE and EF, which are parallel. 

Now, what's the relationship between these lines? Let me sketch mentally. Points D, E, F are colinear because DE and EF are parallel (but they meet at E, so that's only possible if they are the same line). Wait, but if DE and EF are parallel, but share point E, then they must be the same line. Hence, points D, E, F lie on a straight line. 

Therefore, DE and EF are the same line, with E between D and F. So the line DEF is straight. Then AF is perpendicular to this line at point E? No, because AF is perpendicular to DE and EF. Wait, AF connects A to F. So AF is perpendicular to DE (which is the same as EF), so AF is perpendicular to line DEF at point F? Wait, if AF is perpendicular to DE (the line containing D, E, F), then AF must be perpendicular to that line at point F? Or at point E? Wait, the line AF is perpendicular to DE. So line AF intersects line DE at some point. But where?

Wait, line AF goes from A to F. Line DE is the line through D and E. So line AF could intersect line DE at some point. But given that AF is perpendicular to DE, the intersection point would be where AF meets DE. But since line DE contains E, and F is on line DE (since DE and EF are parallel, but they are the same line), then F is on line DE. Therefore, line AF passes through F, which is on line DE. Therefore, AF is perpendicular to line DE at point F. So AF is perpendicular to DE at F. 

Thus, AF is perpendicular to line DEF at point F. So AF is a vertical line if DE is horizontal. Now, angle at F between A, F, E is a right angle. So angle AFE is 90 degrees. That's given. 

But then, what's x? The question says "Find x." But the problem didn't specify what x is. Wait, maybe x refers to the measure of angle at A, or at E, or something else? Maybe there was a diagram that showed angle x? Since the user hasn't provided it, but given the answer choices, it's likely referring to an angle measure. 

Looking at the given RightAngle(Angle(A,F,E)), which is angle at F, so that's 90 degrees. But the answer choices include 90 as option B. But why would x be 90? Unless x is that angle. But the problem states "Find x" without specifying, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe x refers to the measure of angle at A or E. 

Alternatively, maybe x refers to the angle between lines AF and FE, but that's already given as 90 degrees. Or maybe the angle between AF and AD? Not sure. Wait, maybe the problem has a typo or missing info. But assuming that x is one of the angles mentioned, and given that there's a right angle, and other constraints, perhaps x is 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, since AF is perpendicular to both DE and EF, and DE is parallel to EF, then AF forms a right angle with both. Additionally, angle AFE is 9'th'angle, so maybe x is 90. 

Alternatively, since AF is perpendicular to DE and EF, and angle at F is 90, then maybe triangle AFE is a right triangle. If there are other angles involved, but since no other info is given, the only angle specified is 90. Therefore, maybe x is 90. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 90. So likely the answer is B.
