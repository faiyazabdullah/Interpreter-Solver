MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F, O. Then there are several lines: Line(A,D), Line(C,D), Line(A,F), Line(C,F), Line(O,A), Line(O,C). Angles mentioned are Angle(A,F,D), Angle(C,F,D), Angle(O,A,D), Angle(O,C,D). Also, some tangents to a circle centered at O, and some right angles. There are equations involving measures of angles with variables x.

First, let me visualize the diagram. Points A and C seem connected via lines to D and F. O is connected to A and C, so maybe O is the center of a circle? Since there are tangents from A and C to the circle, perhaps AD and CD are tangents? Wait, the predicates say Tangent(Line(A,D), Circle(O)) and Tangent(Line(C,D), Circle(O)). So lines AD and CD are tangent to the circle centered at O. That suggests that OA and OC are radii perpendicular to the tangent lines AD and CD respectively. Because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.

Also, given that RightAngle(Angle(O,A,D)) and RightAngle(Angle(O,C,D)). So angles at O between OA and AD, and OC and CD are right angles. Therefore, OA is perpendicular to AD, and OC is perpendicular to CD. So OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD.

Now, looking at angles: Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(C,F,D) are given with measures 3x and 4x+50 degrees. Also, the difference between these two angles is 30 degrees. And another equation says that the sum of the measure of Angle(A,F,D), Angle(C,F,D), and Angle(F,A,D) equals 180 degrees. Wait, but Angle(F,A,D) is the same as Angle(A,F,D)? Maybe a typo? Or maybe it's referring to another angle?

Wait, the last equality says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))) = 180. But Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(F,A,D) are the same angle? Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(A,B,D) means the angle at point B between points A, B, D. So Angle(A,F,D) is the angle at F between A-F-D. Similarly, Angle(F,A,D) would be the angle at A between F-A-D. Wait, but that seems different. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps the third term is a typo?

Alternatively, maybe the third angle is Angle(F,D,A)? Or maybe it's supposed to be another angle. Wait, the original problem has Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(C,F,D). Then the third angle in the sum is Angle(F,A,D). Let me check again. 

The user wrote: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))), 180). So three angles: Angle(A,F,D), Angle(C,F,D), and Angle(F,A,D). Let me think about how these angles could relate.

But first, let me focus on the given equations. We have:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 3x  
MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)) = 4x + 50  
MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30  
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))) = 180  

Wait, but the second equation is MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30. That implies that (4x + 50) - 3x = 30 → x + 50 = 30 → x = -20. Which doesn't make sense because angles can't be negative. So there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the subtraction isn't straightforward. The way the predicate is written: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)), 30). But angles can't be subtracted directly like that; perhaps it refers to the absolute difference? Or maybe the measure of the difference between the two angles? But if we take the measure of the difference as |(4x + 50) - 3x| = |x + 50| = 30. Then x + 50 = ±30. Solving gives x = -20 or x = -80. Still negative. Not possible. So something is wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the measure of Angle(C,F,D) minus the measure of Angle(A,F,D) equals 30. So (4x + 50) - 3x = 30 → x +50=30 → x=-20. Still impossible. So maybe the initial assumption about the angles is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the third angle in the sum is Angle(F,D,A)? Or maybe there's a miscalculation in interpreting the angle labels. Let me re-examine the angle names.

Angle(A,F,D): This is the angle at point F between points A, F, D. So vertex at F, sides FA and FD. Similarly, Angle(C,F,D) is angle at F between C, F, D. So same vertex F, but one side FC and FD. So those two angles share the common side FD, and their other sides are FA and FC. So together, they form the angle between FA and FC at point F. Wait, but that would mean that the sum of Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(C,F,D) equals the angle between FA and FC. Unless points A, C, and D are arranged such that... Hmm, but maybe there's more to it.

Alternatively, considering that lines AF and CF are present. So points A, F, C are connected via lines. Wait, Line(A,F) and Line(C,F) exist, so F is connected to A and C. So F is a point where lines AF and CF meet. So angle at F between A and C. So the angle at F between A and C is split into two parts: Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(C,F,D). Wait, but D is another point. How does D come into play?

Looking back, there are lines AD and CD. So points A, D, C are connected via lines. Also, lines AF and CF connect F to A and C. So D is connected to A and C. So maybe D is a point such that AD and CD are tangents to the circle centered at O. Given that OA and OC are radii, since OA is perpendicular to AD and OC is perpendicular to CD.

So, considering that OA is perpendicular to AD, and OC is perpendicular to CD. So OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD. Thus, OA and OC are radii of the circle, and AD and CD are tangent lines. Therefore, points A and C lie on the circle? No, wait: if OA is a radius and AD is tangent to the circle, then A is outside the circle, and OA is the radius, so the distance from O to A is equal to the radius. Wait, no: the tangent line AD touches the circle at a single point. But if OA is perpendicular to AD, then the point of tangency must be A itself? Wait, that can't be unless A lies on the circle. Wait, if OA is a radius and AD is tangent to the circle, then the point of tangency would be A. Therefore, A is a point on the circle. Because the radius OA is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of contact. So if AD is tangent to the circle at A, then OA is the radius, and AD is the tangent line. Similarly for CD being tangent at C. So points A and C are on the circle, with OA and OC as radii. Therefore, OA = OC, since they're radii of the same circle.

So, OA and OC are radii of the circle, hence OA = OC. Also, since OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD, then AD and CD are tangent lines at points A and C respectively.

Now, looking at the angles. Let's consider triangle AFD and CFD. Wait, but maybe focusing on triangle AFD. At point F, we have angle AFD (which is Angle(A,F,D)) and angle CFD (Angle(C,F,D)). These two angles at F add up to some total. But also, the third angle in the sum is Angle(F,A,D), which I'm assuming is the angle at A between F and D. Wait, but earlier, the sum includes Angle(F,A,D). Let me clarify.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Point F is connected to A and C. Lines AD and CD are tangents. So D is a point such that AD and CD are tangent to the circle centered at O. Points A and C are on the circle. So D is outside the circle, with AD and CD tangent to the circle. Hence, DA and DC are tangent segments from D to the circle, touching at A and C. Therefore, DA = DC, because tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal. Wait, yes! From point D, the two tangent segments DA and DC to the circle are equal in length. So DA = DC. Hence, triangle DAC is isoceles with DA = DC.

Now, considering point F. It's connected to A and C. So lines AF and CF. The angles at F: Angle(A,F,D) and Angle(C,F,D). These are angles at F between A-F-D and C-F-D. So the sum of these two angles would be the angle between lines FA and FC at point F. But since D is connected to A and C, and F is connected to A and C, perhaps there's a relationship between these angles.

Additionally, the third angle in the sum is Angle(F,A,D). Which is the angle at A between F and D. So angle FAD. So in triangle AFD, we have angles at A (FAD), at F (AFD), and at D (ADF). The sum of these should be 180 degrees. Wait, but the sum given in the problem includes Angle(A,F,D), Angle(C,F,D), and Angle(F,A,D). So adding them together equals 180. Let me see:

Suppose Angle(A,F,D) is ∠AFD, Angle(C,F,D) is ∠CFD, and Angle(F,A,D) is ∠FAD. Adding these three angles: ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD. Is this sum 180?

But ∠AFD and ∠CFD are adjacent angles at point F, forming a larger angle. However, ∠FAD is part of triangle AFD. Let me think. If I consider triangle AFD, its angles are ∠FAD, ∠AFD, and ∠FDA. The sum is 180. So ∠FAD + ∠AFD + ∠FDA = 180. But the problem mentions ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180. So unless ∠CFD is equal to ∠FDA, which may not necessarily be true.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral involved. For example, points A, F, D, C? But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. Let's try to use the given equations.

Given that:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 3x → ∠AFD = 3x  
MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)) = 4x + 50 → ∠CFD = 4x + 50  
MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30 → (4x + 50) - 3x = x + 50 = 30 → x = -20. Which is invalid. So something is wrong here. Perhaps the equation was meant to be the absolute difference, leading to |x + 50| = 30. Which gives x = -20 or x = -80. Both negative. Not possible.

This suggests that my interpretation of the angles is incorrect. Let me double-check the angle labels. 

The problem states:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))), 180)"

So the three angles are:

1. Angle(A,F,D): At point F, between A-F-D.
2. Angle(C,F,D): At point F, between C-F-D.
3. Angle(F,A,D): At point A, between F-A-D.

So these three angles are ∠AFD, ∠CFD, and ∠FAD. Their sum is 180. Let me write down:

∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180°.

But in triangle AFD, ∠AFD + ∠FAD + ∠FDA = 180°. Therefore, substituting ∠FDA with ∠CFD? Only if ∠CFD equals ∠FDA. But why would that be the case?

Wait, if points A, C, D are arranged such that line CD is a tangent, and line AD is a tangent. So D is outside the circle, and lines DA and DC are tangents. So DA = DC, making triangle ADC isoceles with DA = DC. So angle DAC = angle DCA. But how does that relate to the angles at F?

Alternatively, since F is connected to A and C, maybe lines AF and CF intersect at F. Let me think of F as a point inside the circle or outside? Given that OA and OC are radii, and A and C are on the circle. If F is outside, then lines AF and CF could be secants or tangents. But the problem mentions lines AF and CF, but not sure about their relation to the circle.

Alternatively, maybe F is the intersection point of lines AD and BC? Not sure. Without a diagram, it's challenging, but let's proceed with the equations.

Assuming that the sum ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180°, and we have:

From the problem:

∠AFD = 3x  
∠CFD = 4x + 50  
And the third angle ∠FAD is ?

But we also have another equation: MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30. Assuming this is (4x +50) - 3x = x + 50 = 30 ⇒ x = -20. Which is invalid. So there must be an error in interpreting the angle difference.

Maybe the problem meant that the measure of the angle formed by subtracting the two angles is 30 degrees. But since angles can't be negative, perhaps it's the absolute value. So |(4x +50) - 3x| = |x +50| = 30. So x +50 = 30 ⇒ x = -20 or x +50 = -30 ⇒ x = -80. Both negative. Not valid. So perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle labels.

Alternative idea: Maybe the angle difference is not between the two angles but another pair. Or perhaps the angles are supplementary?

Wait, the problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)), 30)".

But angles are measured in degrees, so subtracting two angle measures would give a scalar. So if ∠CFD - ∠AFD = 30°, then (4x +50) - 3x = x +50 = 30 ⇒ x = -20. Again negative. So this suggests that either the problem has a typo, or my understanding of the angles is wrong.

Let me consider alternative interpretations of the angles. What if the angle difference is not between ∠CFD and ∠AFD, but between some other angles? For instance, maybe between ∠CFD and ∠AFD plus something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle labeled Angle(C,F,D) is actually a reflex angle, but that's unlikely in standard problems. Another possibility is that the equations involve the angles in a different configuration.

Let me try to look at the sum of the three angles again. Suppose ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180. Also, from triangle AFD: ∠AFD + ∠FAD + ∠FDA = 180. So comparing these two equations, we get ∠CFD + ∠FAD = ∠FDA + ∠FAD. Wait, that would imply ∠CFD = ∠FDA. So if ∠CFD = ∠FDA, then ∠FDA is equal to ∠CFD.

What is ∠FDA? That is the angle at D between F and A. So in triangle FDA, ∠FDA is at D. Now, since DA is a tangent to the circle at A, and O is the center, then OA is perpendicular to DA. So OA ⊥ DA. Similarly, OC ⊥ DC.

Let me consider triangle ODA. OA is perpendicular to DA, so triangle ODA is a right triangle at A. Similarly for triangle OCD.

Now, since DA = DC (as tangent segments from D to the circle), and OA = OC (radii), then triangles ODA and OCD are congruent by hypotenuse-leg (OD is common, OA=OC, right angles). Therefore, OD is the hypotenuse of both triangles, and DA=DC.

Therefore, point D lies along the perpendicular bisector of AC? Or maybe along the line joining O to the midpoint of AC? Not sure. But since DA=DC, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC.

Now, returning to ∠FDA. In triangle FDA, ∠FDA is the angle at D. If DA is tangent to the circle at A, then OA is perpendicular to DA. So OA ⊥ DA. So OA is perpendicular to DA, implying that OA is the altitude from O to DA. But how does this relate to ∠FDA?

Alternatively, since OA is perpendicular to DA, and O is the center, maybe we can find relations between angles involving OA and DA.

But this seems getting complicated. Let me go back to the angle equations. If ∠CFD = ∠FDA, then ∠CFD = ∠FDA. But ∠FDA is an angle in triangle FDA. Let me try to express ∠FDA in terms of other angles.

In triangle FDA, ∠FDA + ∠FAD + ∠AFD = 180. So ∠FDA = 180 - ∠FAD - ∠AFD. But earlier, we had that ∠CFD = ∠FDA, so ∠CFD = 180 - ∠FAD - ∠AFD. But ∠CFD is given as 4x + 50, and ∠AFD is 3x. Substituting:

4x + 50 = 180 - ∠FAD - 3x  
Which rearranges to: 7x + 50 = 180 - ∠FAD  
→ ∠FAD = 180 - 7x - 50 = 130 - 7x.

Now, recall that the sum of ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180. Substituting:

3x + (4x +50) + (130 -7x) = 180  
Simplify:

3x +4x +50 +130 -7x = 180  
(3x +4x -7x) + (50 +130) = 180  
0x + 180 = 180 → 180 = 180. Which is always true. So this doesn't give new info.

Hmm. So this suggests that the previous assumption that ∠CFD = ∠FDA is correct, but it leads us to an identity. So we need another equation to find x.

But we also have the equation from the difference between the angles: MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30. Which would be (4x +50) - 3x = x +50 = 30 → x = -20. Which is invalid. So this suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or my assumptions are wrong.

Wait, maybe the angle difference is not (4x +50) - 3x, but another combination. For example, maybe the measure of angle CFD minus angle AFD equals 30, but since angle CFD is larger than angle AFD, we have 4x +50 -3x = x +50 = 30 → x = -20. Still negative. Alternatively, could the angle difference be in the other direction? Like angle AFD - angle CFD = 30? That would be 3x - (4x +50) = -x -50 = 30 → -x = 80 → x = -80. Still negative.

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the given equations. But since the problem is solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me revisit the angle definitions.

Another possibility: The angle difference is not between ∠CFD and ∠AFD, but between some other angles. For example, maybe between ∠CFD and ∠AFD plus another angle? Or perhaps the problem involves supplementary angles?

Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there are also RightAngle(Angle(O,A,D)) and RightAngle(Angle(O,C,D)). So angles at O between OA and AD, and OC and CD are right angles. So OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD. So OA is perpendicular to AD, and OC is perpendicular to CD. So lines OA and OC are perpendicular to the respective tangent lines.

Since DA and DC are tangent to the circle, and OA and OC are radii, then OA is perpendicular to DA, and OC is perpendicular to DC. So OA ⊥ DA and OC ⊥ DC. Hence, OA and OC are both perpendicular to their respective tangent lines. 

Now, considering triangles OAD and OCD, which are right triangles at A and C respectively. Since DA = DC (tangents from D to the circle), and OA = OC (radii), then triangles OAD and OCD are congruent by HL (hypotenuse-leg) theorem. Hence, OD is common, OA = OC, and right angles. So OD is the hypotenuse of both triangles.

Thus, OD is the line connecting D to O, and since triangles OAD and OCD are congruent, the distances from O to D are equal. Wait, but OD is the same for both triangles. So DA = DC, as expected.

Now, let me consider the position of point F. Since lines AF and CF are given, and angles at F involving A and C. Maybe point F lies on OD? Or somewhere else?

Alternatively, since OA and OC are radii, and O is the center, perhaps F is the intersection of AF and CF with some other elements. Or maybe F is the intersection of the tangents from D to the circle? No, because DA and DC are already the tangents.

Wait, if DA and DC are tangents from D to the circle, then F could be another point, but I'm missing information about its location. Let me think about the angles again.

Perhaps I should consider triangle AFC. Since F is connected to A and C, and angles at F involving D. Maybe lines FD is related to the circle? Or maybe FD passes through O?

Alternatively, since OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD, and DA = DC, then points A and C are symmetric with respect to OD. So OD is the axis of symmetry. Hence, point F might lie on OD?

If F lies on OD, then the angles at F could have symmetrical properties. Let me assume that F is on OD. Then, lines AF and CF would be symmetric with respect to OD. 

But without knowing where F is located, this is speculative. However, let's try to explore this.

Assume F is on line OD. Then, lines AF and CF would be symmetric with respect to OD. So angles at F involving A and C would be symmetrical. Let's say that ∠AFD and ∠CFD are related. But how?

If F is on OD, then FD is along OD. So the line FD passes through O. Hence, angles at F involving DA and DC would be related to the position of F on OD.

But how does this help with the angle measures? Let's suppose that F is on OD. Then, since OA ⊥ AD and OC ⊥ CD, and DA = DC, then OA and OC are symmetric with respect to OD. Hence, the angles at F could be related to the positions of A and C relative to F.

Alternatively, since OA and OC are radii, and O is the center, if F is on OD, then maybe triangles OAF and OCF have certain properties.

But I'm stuck. Let me return to the angle equations. If I cannot resolve the negative x, perhaps there's a mistake in the angle labeling. Let me re-express the given equations:

Given:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 3x → ∠AFD = 3x  
2. MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)) = 4x + 50 → ∠CFD = 4x + 50  
3. MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30 → (4x +50) - 3x = x +50 = 30 → x = -20. Invalid.  
4. SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))) = 180.  
   → ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180.  
   → 3x + (4x +50) + ∠FAD = 180 → 7x +50 + ∠FAD = 180 → ∠FAD = 130 -7x.

But if x is negative, ∠FAD would be positive if 130 -7x > 0. For example, if x = -20, ∠FAD = 130 -7*(-20) = 130 +140 = 270, which is too large. So invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle subtraction is in the other direction? Like ∠AFD - ∠CFD = 30? That would be 3x - (4x +50) = -x -50 = 30 → -x = 80 → x = -80. Still negative. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given equations, or perhaps I've misinterpreted the angle labels.

Wait, maybe the angle in the third equation is not the difference between the two angles, but the measure of the angle formed by subtracting one from the other in some context. For example, if ∠CFD is larger than ∠AFD, then their difference is 30. But even so, the calculation leads to x = -20.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the measure of the angle between AF and CF is 30 degrees? Or some other angle?

Let me think differently. Let's ignore the problematic equation for now and focus on the sum of angles. We have ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FAD = 180. And from earlier, ∠FAD = 130 -7x. So:

3x + (4x +50) + (130 -7x) = 180  
As before, this simplifies to 180 = 180. So no new information.

But if we can find another equation relating x, we can solve it. Where can we find another equation?

Earlier, we considered that ∠CFD = ∠FDA. Let's verify this. In triangle FDA, ∠FDA + ∠FAD + ∠AFD = 180. So ∠FDA = 180 - ∠FAD - ∠AFD. If ∠CFD = ∠FDA, then ∠CFD = 180 - ∠FAD - ∠AFD. But ∠CFD is given as 4x +50, and ∠AFD is 3x, ∠FAD is 130 -7x. So:

4x +50 = 180 - (130 -7x) - 3x  
4x +50 = 180 -130 +7x -3x  
4x +50 = 50 +4x  
Which simplifies to 4x +50 = 4x +50, which is always true. So no new info.

Thus, this approach isn't helping. Let me think of other ways to relate the angles.

Since DA and DC are tangents to the circle, and OA and OC are radii, then OA ⊥ DA and OC ⊥ DC. Let me consider the lines AF and CF. Maybe triangles OAF and OCF have some properties?

For example, since OA is perpendicular to DA, and F is a point on DA? No, because DA is a tangent line, and F is connected to A. Unless F is on DA, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, maybe lines AF and CF pass through O? If F is the intersection of AO and CO? No, because O is the center, and A and C are points on the circle. If F were on AO, then AF would be along OA, but that would make ∠AFD = 90 degrees, but this is not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, since OA ⊥ DA, and if F is somewhere such that AF is a line from A to F, which is arbitrary. This seems too vague.

Let me try to consider the possibility that the angle difference is not between ∠CFD and ∠AFD, but between ∠CFD and some other angle. For example, maybe the measure of ∠CFD minus the measure of ∠AFD equals 30 degrees, but in reality, it's the other way around. For example, if ∠AFD - ∠CFD = 30, then 3x - (4x +50) = -x -50 = 30 → x = -80. Still negative.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup or my interpretation. Given that the answer choices are A. 10, B. 30, C. 90, D. 120, and assuming that x is positive, perhaps there's a misread in the angle labels.

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(F,A,D))), 180)"

Wait, could it be that Angle(F,A,D) is actually Angle(F,D,A)? Which would be the same as ∠FDA. If that's the case, then the sum becomes ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FDA = 180. Which is the same as ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FDA = 180. But in triangle FDA, ∠AFD + ∠FDA + ∠FAD = 180. So this would imply ∠CFD = ∠FAD. Hence, ∠CFD = ∠FAD.

If that's the case, then ∠CFD = ∠FAD. Given that ∠CFD = 4x +50 and ∠FAD = ? Let me express ∠FAD in terms of other angles.

From triangle AFD, ∠FAD = 180 - ∠AFD - ∠FDA. But if ∠CFD = ∠FAD, then ∠CFD = 180 - ∠AFD - ∠FDA. But ∠CFD is given as 4x +50, ∠AFD is 3x, and ∠FDA is the angle at D in triangle FDA.

Wait, but ∠FDA is the same as ∠CFD if ∠CFD = ∠FAD? No, this is confusing. Let me try again.

If the sum is ∠AFD + ∠CFD + ∠FDA = 180, and from triangle AFD: ∠AFD + ∠FDA + ∠FAD = 180. So equating these two equations, we get ∠CFD + ∠FDA = ∠FDA + ∠FAD → ∠CFD = ∠FAD. So ∠CFD = ∠FAD. Hence, 4x +50 = ∠FAD.

But from triangle AFD, ∠FAD = 180 - ∠AFD - ∠FDA = 180 - 3x - ∠FDA. But ∠CFD = 4x +50 = ∠FAD, so:

4x +50 = 180 -3x - ∠FDA  
→ ∠FDA = 180 -3x -4x -50 = 130 -7x.

But ∠FDA is also part of the sum, which is included in the total 180. But I don't know how to proceed from here.

However, we also have the equation from the difference: MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30. If ∠CFD = 4x +50 and ∠AFD = 3x, then this difference is (4x +50) - 3x = x +50 = 30 → x = -20. Still negative. So this suggests that there's a contradiction, implying that my assumption about the angle labels is incorrect.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that the answer choices are positive, and the only way to get a positive x is if there's a different interpretation. Let me try to consider that the angle difference is in the other direction, i.e., ∠AFD - ∠CFD = 30. So 3x - (4x +50) = -x -50 = 30 → x = -80. Still negative.

Alternatively, maybe the angle difference is between ∠CFD and ∠AFD plus some other angle? Or maybe the problem has a typo, and the correct equation is MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,D) - Angle(A,F,D)) = 30, but with x positive. Let me try to set x = 10, which is option A. Then:

If x = 10, then ∠CFD = 4*10 +50 = 90, ∠AFD = 3*10 = 30. Difference is 90 -30 = 60 ≠ 30. Not matching.

If x = 30: ∠CFD = 4*30 +50 = 170, ∠AFD = 90. Difference 170 -90 = 80 ≠ 30.

x = 90: ∠CFD = 4*90 +50 = 410, which is impossible.

x = 120: ∠CFD = 4*120 +50 = 530, also impossible.

None of these work. So perhaps the correct x is 10, and there's a typo in the angle difference equation. For example, if the difference was 60 instead of 30, then x = 10 would work. But since this is not the case, I'm forced to conclude that there's an error in the problem statement, or I have misinterpreted the angle labels.

Given that the answer choices are A. 10, B. 30, C. 90, D. 120, and assuming that the intended answer is A. 10, despite the inconsistencies, perhaps the correct x is 10, and there was a mistake in the problem's angle difference equation. Alternatively, maybe the angle difference is between ∠CFD and ∠AFD plus another angle.

But given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the assumption that the angle difference equation is supposed to be ∠CFD - ∠AFD = 30, leading to x = -20, but since this is invalid, perhaps the correct x is 10, and the problem has a typo, leading to the answer A. 10.
