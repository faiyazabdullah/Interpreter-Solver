MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

So, we have several Square(A,B,C,D) – that means points A, B, C, D form a square. Then there are Points Q, X. Wait, Point(Q) is mentioned twice? Maybe that's a typo, but maybe it's just emphasizing that Q is a point. Then Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A) – these are the sides of the square since connecting those points forms a square. 

Next, Line(Q,Q). Hmm, a line from Q to itself? That doesn't make much sense geometrically; perhaps it's a way to denote a point or maybe a degenerate line. But then there are two Line(Q,C) entries. So Q is connected to C twice. Also, there are some equality predicates: Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 5) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 15). Wait, that seems contradictory because the same length can't be both 5 and 15 unless there's a mistake here. Or maybe there's more to it?

Wait, looking at the list again: 

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 5)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 15)
- Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)))
- Equals(x, Sub(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C))))
- Equals(x, 10)
- RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 2)

Hmm, so there's conflicting information about the length of Line(Q,C): first it's stated to be 5, then later 15. That's confusing. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the predicates are structured. Let me check again.

Looking at the user input, the third line says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 15)" 

But earlier there was "Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 5)". So that suggests that the length of QC is both 5 and 15? That can't be possible unless there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and one of the equals should be something else. Wait, perhaps the second Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 5) is actually another part? Let me re-examine the original problem statement.

Wait, the user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Square(A,B,C,D)
Point(Q)
Point(Q)
Point(X)
Line(A,B)
Line(B,C)
Line(C,D)
Line(D,A)
Line(Q,Q)
Line(Q,C)
Line(Q,C)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 5)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 15)
Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)))
Equals(x, Sub(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C))))
Equals(x, 10)
RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 2)"

Wait, so there are two Equals statements for Line(Q,C): one says it's 5, another says it's 15. This contradiction implies that there's an error in the problem setup, but since we're supposed to work with the given predicates, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the line is being added in different contexts?

Alternatively, maybe the Add function here isn't referring to addition but to concatenating segments? But the next line is Equals(x, Sub(...)), where Sub would be subtraction. Let me think.

Let me process each predicate step by step.

First, the Square(A,B,C,D) defines a square with vertices A, B, C, D. So AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the square, hence all equal in length and each angle is 90 degrees.

Then, Point(Q) and Point(X) – but there are two Point(Q)s? Maybe that's redundant, but perhaps Q is a single point. Then Lines: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), etc., which are the sides of the square. Then Line(Q,Q) – which is a degenerate line segment starting and ending at Q. Then Line(Q,C) appears twice, indicating that Q is connected to C, possibly implying that Q lies somewhere relative to the square.

Now, the LengthOf(Line(Q,C)) is given as 5 and also as 15. This seems contradictory. Unless there's a misinterpretation here. Wait, perhaps the first Equals(LengthOf(...), 5) is incorrect, and the second one is correct? Or maybe the problem has a typo. However, since we have to proceed with the given data, perhaps the intention is that the length of QC is 15, and there's an error in the first statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different variables or contexts.

Wait, looking further down, there's an Add operation: Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C))). Which would imply adding the length of QC and QQ (which is zero, since it's a degenerate line) to get the length of QC again. But that would be trivial. Then Equals(x, Sub(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)))), which would be subtracting QC from itself, giving zero, so x=0? But then Equals(x,10) says x=10. Contradiction again. So this seems like there's inconsistency in the given predicates.

Alternatively, maybe the Add function isn't standard arithmetic. For example, if Add(a,b,c) represents a + b = c? Or maybe concatenation? Not sure. Similarly, Sub could be subtraction. But if we take the given that Equals(x, Sub(...)) gives x=10, and also RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 2) which would mean that LengthOf(QQ)/LengthOf(QC) = 2. Since LengthOf(QQ) is zero (because it's a degenerate line), this ratio would be undefined. But the problem states that this ratio is 2. So this is conflicting.

This suggests that there's a lot of contradictions in the given predicates, making it impossible to resolve. However, since this is a math problem, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicates. Let me try to focus on the parts that are consistent.

Assuming that the intended length of QC is 15, since that's the last mention. Then the ratio of LengthOf(QQ) to LengthOf(QC) is 2. But LengthOf(QQ) is zero, which can't be. Therefore, perhaps the Line(Q,Q) is not a degenerate line but refers to something else. Wait, maybe Line(Q,Q) is meant to represent a different entity? Like a line passing through Q and another point? But the notation is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the Line(Q,Q) is a typo and should be Line(Q,X)? But without knowing, it's hard to tell. However, the problem mentions Point(X), so maybe there's a line from Q to X? But the given Line(Q,Q) is present. 

Another possibility: Maybe the Line(Q,Q) is a vector or direction, but that's stretching beyond standard geometry. Given the confusion, perhaps the key is to look at the RatioOf predicate. It says RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(Q,Q)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), 2). So this implies that LengthOf(QQ) / LengthOf(QC) = 2. Therefore, LengthOf(QQ) = 2 * LengthOf(QC).

But if LengthOf(QC) is 15 (from the Equals(LengthOf(...), 15)), then LengthOf(QQ) would be 30. But then the Equals(x, Sub(...)) says x=10, which conflicts with this. Alternatively, if LengthOf(QC) is 5, then LengthOf(QQ) would be 10, matching the x=10. However, there's also an Equals(x, Sub(...)) where Sub is subtraction, leading to x=0. So this is conflicting.

Wait, let's parse the Equals(x, Sub(LengthOf(Line(Q,C)), LengthOf(Line(Q,C)))): this would be x = LengthOf(QC) - LengthOf(QC) = 0. But then it says Equals(x,10), so x=10. Therefore, this implies that 0=10, which is impossible. Hence, the given predicates are inconsistent. But since this is a problem to solve, there must be a way to interpret this correctly.

Perhaps the Add and Sub functions are not arithmetic operations but refer to other geometric constructs. For instance, Add(a,b,c) might mean a + b = c. So Add(LengthOf(QC), LengthOf(QQ), LengthOf(QC)) would translate to LengthOf(QC) + LengthOf(QQ) = LengthOf(QC), implying that LengthOf(QQ)=0. Which again brings us back to the same issue.

Given the contradictions in the problem, perhaps the intended meaning is that the length of QC is 15, and the ratio of QQ to QC is 2, so QQ = 2*QC. Wait, but if that's the case, then QQ would be 30. However, the Equals(x, Sub(...)) leads to x=0. But the problem also says Equals(x,10). Therefore, there's still inconsistency.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors instead of lengths. For example, the ratio of vectors, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the Add and Sub functions are meant to be used differently. For example, Add(a,b,c) could mean a + b = c, and Sub(a,b) = a - b. So let's see:

From the Add predicate: Add(LengthOf(QC), LengthOf(QQ), LengthOf(QC)) → LengthOf(QC) + LengthOf(QQ) = LengthOf(QC) → LengthOf(QQ) = 0. 

Then, Sub(LengthOf(QC), LengthOf(QC)) = 0, so x=0. But then Equals(x,10) implies x=10. Contradiction again.

However, if we ignore the contradiction and focus on the RatioOf predicate: RatioOf(LengthOf(QQ), LengthOf(QC), 2) → LengthOf(QQ)/LengthOf(QC) = 2 → LengthOf(QQ) = 2 * LengthOf(QC). If we assume that LengthOf(QC) is 15, then LengthOf(QQ) would be 30. But according to the previous calculation, LengthOf(QQ) is zero. 

But the problem also has Equals(x,10), which might relate to LengthOf(QQ). If x is LengthOf(QQ), then from the ratio, x = 2 * LengthOf(QC). But if LengthOf(QC) is 15, then x=30. But the Equals(x,10) says x=10. So this doesn't align. Alternatively, if LengthOf(QC) is 5, then x=10, which matches the Equals(x,10). 

This suggests that the correct length of QC is 5, and the ratio is 2, so LengthOf(QQ) = 10. But then why is there an Equals(LengthOf(QC),15) in the predicates? There's a contradiction here. 

Perhaps the initial Equals(LengthOf(...),5) is a mistake, and the correct one is 15. But if that's the case, then the ratio would give x=30, but the Equals(x,10) contradicts that. 

Alternatively, maybe the Add and Sub predicates are meant to be parsed differently. For example, Add(a, b, c) means a + b = c. So, Add(LengthOf(QC), LengthOf(QQ), LengthOf(QC)) → LengthOf(QC) + LengthOf(QQ) = LengthOf(QC) → LengthOf(QQ) = 0. 

Then, Sub(LengthOf(QC), LengthOf(QC)) = 0, so x = 0. But the problem says Equals(x,10), which is conflicting. 

However, there's another Equals(x,10), so x=10. If we ignore the contradiction, and focus on the ratio, which says LengthOf(QQ)/LengthOf(QC) = 2. So LengthOf(QQ) = 2 * LengthOf(QC). If x is LengthOf(QQ), then x = 2 * LengthOf(QC). But from the Equals(x,10), x=10, so LengthOf(QC)=5. 

Thus, even though there's a conflicting Equals(LengthOf(QC),15), maybe that's a red herring, or there's a typo. Assuming that the correct length of QC is 5, then x=10, and the ratio is 2. 

Therefore, the scale factor from Q to Q'... wait, the question asks for the scale factor from Q to Q'. But where does Q' come into play? The problem mentions Point(X), but Q' isn't defined. Wait, the problem says "scale factor from Q to Q'", but Q' isn't mentioned elsewhere. Maybe it's a typo, and Q' is supposed to be C? Or perhaps it's a reflection or transformation?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(Q,C) and Line(Q,Q). If Q' is a point such that the scale factor relates Q to Q', maybe through similarity or dilation. But without more info, it's tricky. However, the RatioOf predicate might indicate that the scale factor is 2, as per the RatioOf(LengthOf(QQ), LengthOf(QC), 2), which would suggest that the scale factor is 2. 

If the scale factor is the ratio between QQ and QC, which is 2, then the answer would be A. But the options are A. 2, B. 3, etc. So if the ratio is 2, then the answer is A. 

But earlier, assuming LengthOf(QC)=5, then LengthOf(QQ)=10, and the ratio is 10/5=2. So the scale factor would be 2. Thus, the answer is A. 

But why is there a conflicting LengthOf(QC)=15? Maybe that's a mistake in the problem, and the correct value is 5. Since the ratio gives us x=10, which aligns with LengthOf(QQ)=10, and the ratio is 2. Hence, the scale factor is 2, so answer A.
