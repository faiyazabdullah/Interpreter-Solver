MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD with certain predicates given. Let me first parse all the information provided.

First, the quadrilateral is defined by points A, B, C, D connected in order: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). That means it's a four-sided figure with those vertices connected sequentially. Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A), and Angle(D,A,B). These are the four angles of the quadrilateral at each vertex. Also, two of these angles are right angles: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)). Additionally, the sum of all four angles equals 360 degrees, which is a standard property of quadrilaterals. Wait, but they also specify that SumOf(MeasureOf all four angles) equals 360, so that checks out since the sum of interior angles in any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.

But wait, the problem says that two of the angles are right angles. Specifically, angle at B (Angle(A,B,C)) and angle at C (Angle(B,C,D)) are right angles. So, angles at B and C are each 90 degrees. Now, the question is asking for measure of angle A, which is Angle(D,A,B).

Let me write down what I know:

- Quadrilateral ABCD has four angles: at A, B, C, D.
- Angles at B and C are right angles (90° each).
- Sum of all four angles is 360°.
- Need to find measure of angle at A.

So, if angles at B and C are each 90°, then the sum of angles at A and D would be 360° - 90° - 90° = 180°. Therefore, angle A + angle D = 180°. But how do we find angle A specifically?

Wait, but there's more information here. Are there any other constraints? Let me check again. The problem gives the sum of all four angles as 360°, which is already accounted for. However, maybe there's something about the sides or other angles? Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the sides being equal or any other angles. Hmm. Wait, unless there's some hidden information from the way the quadrilateral is constructed. For example, if it's a rectangle or a square, but since only two angles are right angles, it's not necessarily a rectangle. Or perhaps it's a trapezoid?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Wait, the problem states that the sum of all four angles is 360°, which is redundant because that's a general property of quadrilaterals. So perhaps the key lies in the fact that two angles are right angles, but without more info, we can't directly determine angle A. Unless... Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is cyclic? Because if it were cyclic, opposite angles would sum to 180°, but that's only true for cyclic quadrilaterals. However, if two adjacent angles are right angles, then the other two angles would need to add up to 180°, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are supplementary unless the quadrilateral is cyclic. But there's no indication that the quadrilateral is cyclic. 

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since the problem gives us that the sum of all four angles is 360°, and two of them are 90°, then angles A and D sum to 180°, but without more info, angle A could be any value between 0 and 180°, depending on angle D. But the answer options are specific: 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°. So maybe there's something missing here. Did I miss any other predicates?

Looking back, the problem lists the predicates: Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D), Points A-D, Lines AB, BC, CD, DA, angles at each vertex, two right angles, and the sum of measures equals 360. Wait, but the sum is already guaranteed by the definition of a quadrilateral, so that's just confirming the general rule. So, with only that info, angle A could be anything as long as angle D is 180 minus angle A. But since the answer choices are fixed, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the quadrilateral is convex or something else. Wait, but even so, without more constraints, how can we determine angle A?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-express the problem. The problem says:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))". So angle at B (between A-B-C) is 90°, angle at C (between B-C-D) is 90°. So the quadrilateral has two consecutive right angles at B and C. Let me try drawing this mentally. Starting from point A, going to B, then to C (with a right angle at B and C). Wait, but if angle at B is 90°, then AB is perpendicular to BC. Similarly, angle at C is 90°, so BC is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is perpendicular to CD. Which implies that AB is parallel to CD? Wait, no. If AB ⊥ BC and BC ⊥ CD, then AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, hence AB is parallel to CD. So AB || CD. So the quadrilateral has AB parallel to CD. 

Additionally, since AB || CD, and AD connects A to D, forming the fourth side. Now, considering that, the quadrilateral is a trapezoid with AB || CD. In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Wait, but here we have two right angles. Let me think. If AB || CD, then angles at A and D are on the same side. Wait, but in a trapezoid, consecutive angles on the same base are supplementary. Wait, no, actually, in a trapezoid, each pair of angles on the same leg are supplementary. Wait, let me recall: In a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, legs BC and DA. Then angles at B and C are adjacent to base BC. Wait, but in our case, angles at B and C are right angles. So if AB is parallel to CD, then angle at B (between AB and BC) is 90°, and angle at C (between BC and CD) is 90°, so BC is perpendicular to both AB and CD. Hence, BC is a vertical line if AB and CD are horizontal. Thus, making AB and CD parallel, and BC perpendicular to both. Therefore, the trapezoid is a rectangle? No, because in a rectangle all angles are 90°, but here only two angles are 90°, and the other two angles (at A and D) would depend on the length of the sides.

Wait, but if AB is parallel to CD, and BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, then the trapezoid is a rectangle only if AD is also perpendicular to AB and CD. Otherwise, it's a right trapezoid. So, a right trapezoid has two right angles. So, in this case, the quadrilateral is a right trapezoid with AB || CD and BC perpendicular to AB and CD. Therefore, angles at B and C are 90°, and angles at A and D are the other two angles. Now, since AB || CD, then angles at A and D should be supplementary. Wait, because in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So angle A + angle D = 180°, as previously noted. But how does that help us find angle A?

Unless there's more constraints. Wait, but the problem didn't mention any other angles or sides. So maybe there's an assumption that it's a rectangle? But no, because only two angles are specified as right angles. Alternatively, maybe there's something else. Let me think again. Maybe the fact that the sum of all angles is 360° isn't giving us new info, but maybe the problem is expecting us to realize that since two angles are 90°, and the other two angles sum to 180°, but without further info, how can we choose between the options given?

Wait, looking at the answer choices: 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°. So, if angle A is one of these, and angle D is 180° minus angle A. But why would angle A be 135°, for instance? Is there any other constraint?

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is convex. In a convex quadrilateral, all interior angles are less than 180°. So angle A cannot be 180°, so D is out. But then, angle A could be 45°, 90°, or 135°. How to decide?

Wait, but maybe there's another property. Let me consider the sides. If AB is parallel to CD, and BC is perpendicular to AB, then BC is the height of the trapezoid. The side AD connects A to D. If we assume that AD is not perpendicular to AB or CD, then angles at A and D are not right angles. But without knowing the lengths of the sides, we can't determine the exact measure of angles A and D. So how is the answer determined?

Wait, perhaps there's an error in my initial assumptions. Let me go back. The problem states that the sum of the measures of all four angles is 360°, which is always true for any quadrilateral. But the problem also includes two right angles. However, there's no other information about the other angles. Therefore, without additional constraints, the measure of angle A can't be uniquely determined. But since the answer choices are given, there must be something I'm missing.

Wait, let me check the original problem again. Oh! Wait, the problem says "SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A))) equals 360." Wait, that's the same as the total sum of all four angles. But maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misread the angles. Let me verify:

Angle(D,A,B): This is the angle at point A, formed by points D-A-B. So that's angle at A between DA and AB. Wait, earlier I thought angle at A was Angle(D,A,B), which is correct. Then angle at B is Angle(A,B,C), which is correct. Angle at C is Angle(B,C,D), and angle at D is Angle(C,D,A). So yes, the four angles are correctly identified.

Now, the problem says that two of these angles are right angles: Angle(A,B,C) and Angle(B,C,D). So angles at B and C are 90°, as before. Then, the sum of angles is 360°, which gives angle A + angle D = 180°. Still, without more info, we can't determine angle A. But since the answer choices are specific, maybe the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is a rectangle? But then all angles would be 90°, which contradicts the given that only two angles are right angles. Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is a square? No, same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves the fact that in a quadrilateral with two right angles, and AB parallel to CD, the other two angles are supplementary. But if the quadrilateral is a right trapezoid, then angles at A and D are supplementary. However, without more info, such as the type of trapezoid, we can't say. Unless there's a property that in a right trapezoid, the non-right angles are equal? No, that's not generally true. They could be different.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. But since the answer choices are given, and the options include 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, maybe there's a way to deduce it. Let me think differently. Suppose angle A is 90°, then angle D would also be 90°, making all four angles 90°, which would make it a rectangle. But the problem specifies that only angles at B and C are right angles. So that's impossible. Therefore, angle A cannot be 90°, eliminating option B.

Similarly, if angle A is 180°, that would make the quadrilateral degenerate, as angle A would be straight, collapsing points A and D onto the line AB extended. So that's probably not intended. So option D is invalid.

That leaves options A (45°) and C (135°). But how to choose between them? Wait, maybe the problem relies on the fact that in a right trapezoid, the other two angles are complementary? No, that's not necessarily true. Wait, but if AB is parallel to CD, and BC is perpendicular to AB, then AD is slanting. Let me imagine coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates to visualize. Let’s place point B at (0,0). Since angle at B is 90°, and AB is connected to B, let's assume AB is along the x-axis and BC is along the y-axis. So point B is at (0,0). Point A could be at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Point C would be at (0, c) for some c > 0. Now, since angle at C is 90°, CD is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is along the y-axis, CD must be horizontal. So from point C(0,c), moving horizontally. Let's say CD goes to the left or right. Let me assume it goes to the left, so point D is at (-d, c) for some d > 0. Now, connect D to A(a,0). So the last side is DA from D(-d,c) to A(a,0). 

Now, compute angle at A. Angle at A is between DA and AB. AB is from A(a,0) to B(0,0), which is along negative x-axis. DA is from A(a,0) to D(-d,c). So vector AB is (-a, 0), and vector AD is (-d - a, c - 0) = (-d - a, c). The angle at A is between AB and AD. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula.

Let me calculate the vectors:

Vector AB: from A to B is B - A = (0 - a, 0 - 0) = (-a, 0).

Vector AD: from A to D is D - A = (-d - a, c - 0) = (-d - a, c).

The angle between AB and AD is angle at A. Let's denote this angle as θ.

The cosine of θ is equal to the dot product of AB and AD divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Dot product: (-a)(-d - a) + (0)(c) = a(d + a).

Magnitude of AB: sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a.

Magnitude of AD: sqrt[(-d - a)^2 + c^2] = sqrt[(a + d)^2 + c^2].

Thus,

cosθ = [a(d + a)] / [a * sqrt((a + d)^2 + c^2)] ) ] = (d + a)/sqrt((a + d)^2 + c^2)

This simplifies to cosθ = (a + d)/sqrt((a + d)^2 + c^2)

Which means that θ is arccos[(a + d)/sqrt((a + d)^2 + c^2)]

This depends on the ratio of (a + d) to c. Without knowing the specific values of a, d, c, we can't determine θ. So angle A could vary depending on the lengths of the sides.

But the answer choices are fixed. How can we determine which one is correct? There must be a missing piece of information. Wait, but the problem includes the predicate Equals(SumOf(...), 360), which we've already used. What else? Wait, are there any other constraints from the given predicates? The problem mentions that the quadrilateral is defined with the given lines and angles, but no other specifics.

Wait, but in this coordinate setup, angle D is the angle at D, between C-D-A. Let's compute that angle. Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - (-d), c - c) = (d, 0). Vector DA is from D to A: (a - (-d), 0 - c) = (a + d, -c). The angle at D is between DC and DA. Using the same method:

Vectors DC: (d, 0)

DA: (a + d, -c)

Dot product: d*(a + d) + 0*(-c) = d(a + d)

Magnitude of DC: sqrt(d² + 0²) = d

Magnitude of DA: sqrt[(a + d)^2 + c²]

So cos(angle at D) = [d(a + d)]/[d * sqrt((a + d)^2 + c²)] = (a + d)/sqrt((a + d)^2 + c²)

Notice that this is the same as cos(theta) where theta is angle at A. Therefore, angle at D is equal to angle at A. Because the calculation for angle D's cosine is identical to angle A's cosine. Hence, angle A = angle D.

Earlier, we had angle A + angle D = 180°, so if angle A = angle D, then each is 90°. But that contradicts the previous conclusion that angle A + angle D = 180°, leading to each being 90°. But earlier, we said that angle A can't be 90°, because that would imply all angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. But in this scenario, angle A and D are both 90°, but angles at B and C are also 90°, making all angles 90°, which would make it a rectangle. However, the problem states that only angles at B and C are right angles. So this suggests inconsistency.

Wait, this indicates a contradiction. How come? Let me recheck. According to the coordinate system, angle A and D are equal, and their sum is 180°, so each is 90°, implying all angles are 90°, which would make it a rectangle. But the problem says only angles at B and C are right angles. So either the problem is inconsistent, or there's a misunderstanding in the setup.

Ah, here's the mistake: When I assumed that angle at D is computed as above, but in reality, angle D is between points C-D-A. Wait, in the coordinate system, point D is connected to C and A. So angle at D is between CD and DA. Earlier, I computed that angle D's cosine is (a + d)/sqrt(...) which equals the same expression as angle A. So angle A = angle D. But according to the earlier logic, angle A + angle D = 180°, so each is 90°, which implies all angles are right angles. Hence, this suggests that the quadrilateral must be a rectangle, contradicting the given that only angles at B and C are right angles. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps my coordinate assignment is flawed. Let me double-check. If angle at D is between CD and DA. In the coordinate system, CD is horizontal from C(0,c) to D(-d,c), so direction from C to D is left. DA is from D(-d,c) to A(a,0), which slopes downward. So the angle at D is between DC (from D to C, which is rightward) and DA (downward slope). So angle at D is between DC (right) and DA (down-left). Whereas angle at A is between AB (left) and AD (up-left). Wait, maybe I mixed up the vectors for angle D?

Wait, angle at D is between CD and DA. Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - (-d), c - c) = (d, 0). Vector DD is from D to A: (a - (-d), 0 - c) = (a + d, -c). So the angle at D is between DC (vector (d,0)) and DA (vector (a+d,-c)). Earlier computation shows that the cosine of this angle is (a + d)/sqrt(...), same as angle at A. So angle A and angle D are equal. But according to the sum, they should add to 180°, hence each is 90°, leading to all angles being right angles. But the problem says only angles at B and C are right angles. So this suggests that the only possibility is that all angles are right angles, but the problem states otherwise. This contradiction indicates that my initial assumption about the configuration may be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is not a right trapezoid, but some other shape. Wait, but given that angles at B and C are right angles, and AB is connected to B, BC to C, CD to D, DA to A, then AB must be perpendicular to BC, and BC perpendicular to CD, making AB parallel to CD. So it must be a right trapezoid. Hence, this leads to the conclusion that angles at A and D are equal and sum to 180°, hence each is 90°, which conflicts with the problem's condition. So what's the resolution?

Perhaps the problem allows for angle A or D to be 90°, even though it says only angles at B and C are right angles? Or maybe the problem's wording is ambiguous. Let me reread the problem's predicates:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))". It does not say that only those angles are right angles. So it's possible that angle A or D could also be right angles. But in that case, the sum would still hold. So, if angle A is 90°, then angle D is also 90°, making all angles right angles, which is acceptable under the given predicates. But the problem asks for m∠A, which could be 90°, but that's option B. But earlier I thought that would conflict with the problem's phrasing, but perhaps it's allowed. However, the answer choices include B as 90°, so why wouldn't that be the answer?

Wait, but if angle A is 90°, then angle D is also 90°, making all four angles 90°, which satisfies the given conditions. But the problem didn't state that only angles at B and C are right angles, so it's possible that others are too. Hence, angle A could be 90°, making it option B. But why would the problem include this as an option if it's not the only possibility?

However, this leads to ambiguity. But since the answer choices are given, and the only way for angle A to be determined is if it's part of a specific configuration. Wait, but earlier calculations showed that angle A and angle D are equal. Hence, if angle A is 90°, then angle D is 90°, making all angles right angles. But if angle A is not 90°, then angle D is also not 90°, but their sum is 180°. So, for example, angle A could be 45°, angle D 135°, or vice versa. But how to choose between these?

Since the problem provides answer choices including 45, 90, 135, 180, and the only way to determine angle A is if there's additional information. But since none is provided, perhaps the problem expects us to recognize that in a right trapezoid, the other two angles are supplementary, but without more info, we can't determine individual measures. However, the presence of two right angles might imply something else. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses the fact that the sum of all angles is 360°, and two are 90°, leaving 180° for the remaining two. If the quadrilateral is cyclic, then opposite angles would sum to 180°, but since two angles are 90°, the other two would also need to be 90°, making it a rectangle. But again, this brings us back to all angles being 90°, which is possible. But this is speculative.

Given that the answer choices don't allow for any other possibilities, and since the problem includes angle A as one of the options, and the only way for angle A to be uniquely determined is if it's 90°, but that creates a contradiction. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is not a rectangle, then angle A and D must sum to 180°, but neither is 90°. So among the options, 45° and 135° are possible. How to choose between them?

Maybe the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is convex and symmetric in some way. If AB and CD are of equal length, then the trapezoid would be symmetrical, making angles at A and D equal. But without knowing lengths, we can't confirm. Alternatively, if AD is perpendicular to AB, making it a rectangle, but that would make angle A 90°, which is option B.

But this is all speculation. Given the lack of additional information, and the answer choices, the most plausible answer might be 90°, assuming the quadrilateral is a rectangle. However, this contradicts the problem's explicit mention of only two right angles, but perhaps the problem allows for more. Alternatively, the answer could be 135°, but why?

Wait, let's think of a right trapezoid where angle A is 135°. If angle A is 135°, then angle D is 45°, which would satisfy the sum. But how does that fit with the trapezoid structure? For example, if the side AD is longer, causing angle A to be obtuse. 

But without concrete data, it's impossible to determine. However, given that the problem is likely designed to have a unique answer, and considering common geometric problems, the most probable intended answer is 90°, assuming the quadrilateral is a rectangle, despite the apparent contradiction in the problem's wording. Alternatively, the problem might expect recognizing that with two right angles, and the other two angles supplementary, but without further info, it's impossible to determine. However, since the answer choices include 90°, and given that the sum of angles is 360°, and two are 90°, the remaining two could be 90° each, making it a rectangle, which is a valid case. Hence, angle A is 90°, option B.

But earlier calculations suggested that angle A and D are equal, hence both 90°, which fits. So despite the problem stating that only angles at B and C are right angles, it's possible that angles at A and D are also right angles, making it a rectangle. Hence, the answer is B. But this feels conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intends that only angles at B and C are right angles, so angles at A and D are not. Hence, their sum is 180°, and since the answer options include 45 and 135, but how to choose? If the trapezoid is not symmetric, it's arbitrary. However, in many standardized tests, such problems often assume symmetry or specific configurations. For example, if the trapezoid is isosceles, but in a right trapezoid, isosceles would require it to be a rectangle. So this is confusing.

Another angle: if the problem states that the sum of the four angles is 360°, which is always true, and two of them are 90°, then the other two sum to 180°. But the problem might be testing knowledge that in a quadrilateral with two right angles, the other two angles are supplementary. But without additional info, we can't determine their individual measures. Hence, the problem must have a trick.

Wait, let's revisit the initial setup. The problem includes the predicate "Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)" and defines the four angles. The key might be that in a quadrilateral, the sum of the angles is 360°, and two are 90°, so the other two sum to 180°. But if the quadrilateral is convex, then each angle is less than 180°. But the answer choices include 180°, which would make it degenerate. So options are 45, 90, 135. 

But how to choose? Perhaps the problem is a rectangle, but with only two right angles, but that's contradictory. Alternatively, the problem is a kite? No, a kite usually has two pairs of adjacent sides equal, but not necessarily angles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a rectangle, but due to a typo, it says only two angles are right angles. In that case, the answer would be 90°, option B. Or, if it's a right trapezoid, and the other angles are 135° and 45°, but how to know which is which?

Wait, in a right trapezoid, the non-right angles can be acute or obtuse. For example, if the top base CD is shorter than AB, then angle A would be obtuse and angle D acute, or vice versa. But without knowing the lengths, it's impossible to tell. However, since the answer choices are given, and 135° is an option, perhaps it's expected to assume that angle A is obtuse. But why?

Alternatively, if the problem is from a textbook or standard test, there might be a standard configuration. For example, in a right trapezoid with AB and CD parallel, and BC perpendicular to them, if AD is inclined such that angle A is 135°, then angle D is 45°. But why 135°?

Without more information, I'm stuck. However, given the answer choices and the need to pick one, and considering that in a right trapezoid, if AB is longer than CD, angle A would be obtuse. So if angle A is 135°, then angle D is 45°. Alternatively, if AB is shorter, angle A would be acute. But since the answer choices include both 45 and 135, it's unclear.

Wait, but let's look back at the initial problem. It says "Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)", with the points connected in order. The angles at B and C are right angles. So, if I imagine this quadrilateral, starting at A, going to B, turning 90° at B to go to C, then turning 90° at C to go to D, and then back to A. This forms a right trapezoid. Now, if you draw this, the angle at A and D depend on the lengths of the sides. But if the trapezoid is such that AD is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then angles at A and D could be 45° and 135°. For example, if AB and CD are equal in length, and BC is the height, then AD would form a diagonal of a square, leading to 45° angles. But that would make it a rectangle. 

Alternatively, if AD is not aligned with any particular symmetry, it could be 135°. But again, without specific information, it's hard to say. 

Given that the problem is presented with answer choices and the need to select one, and considering common geometric problems, the most likely intended answer is 135°, assuming that angle A is obtuse. Hence, option C. But why? 

Wait, another approach: if the quadrilateral is a rectangle, all angles are 90°, but the problem says only angles at B and C are right angles, so that's not allowed. Hence, angle A can't be 90°, so eliminate B. If it's a right trapezoid with AB and CD parallel, BC perpendicular, and AD sloping such that angle A is 135°, then angle D is 45°. This is possible. Hence, option C: 135°.

But why 135°? Let me think: if you have a right trapezoid where AB is much longer than CD, then angle A would be close to 180°, but if it's balanced, maybe 135°. But this is still guesswork.

Alternatively, since the sum of angles at A and D is 180°, and the answer options are 45, 90, 135, 180, and the problem likely expects one of these, the answer must be 135°, as it's the only one that is not 90° or 180°, and fits with the idea of supplementary angles. But this is still speculative.

Given the confusion and lack of definitive clues, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the problem includes two right angles and asks for angle A, and given that in a right trapezoid, the other two angles are supplementary, and among the options, 135° is an obtuse angle that could be paired with 45°, I'll choose 135° as the answer. Hence, option C.
