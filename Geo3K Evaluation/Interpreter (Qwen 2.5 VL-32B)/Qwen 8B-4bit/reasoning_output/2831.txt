Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with some conditions. The main goal is to find the length of segment AX, denoted as x, given some other lengths and tangent lines to a circle. 

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

Points A, B, C, D, E, F. There's a circle O. Lines AB, BE, CF, AD, AX. Also, lines BE, CF, and AX are tangent to the circle O. Then there are perpendicularity conditions: OE is perpendicular to BE, OF is perpendicular to CF, and OX is perpendicular to AX. Additionally, the lengths of BE is 15, CF is 12, AD is 8, and AX is x. We need to find x.

So, since BE, CF, and AX are tangent to the circle, and the radii at the points of tangency are perpendicular to the tangent lines. That means OE is perpendicular to BE, OF perpendicular to CF, and OX perpendicular to AX. These perpendiculars would be the radii of the circle O. Therefore, O is the center of the circle, and OE, OF, OX are radii.

Wait, but how do these tangents relate? For each tangent line, the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. So, for example, line BE is tangent to the circle at point E? Wait, but the line BE is named as Line(B,E). But the tangent line could touch the circle at a single point. However, the problem states that the lines BE, CF, and AX are tangent to the circle. But the points B, E, C, F, A, X may or may not lie on the circle. However, since they are tangent lines, each of these lines touches the circle at exactly one point. 

But here, the problem says that Line(B,E) is tangent to the circle O. So, this line is tangent, so it touches the circle at exactly one point. Similarly for the others. Now, the perpendicular from O to the tangent line would meet the tangent line at the point of tangency. So, for instance, the line OE is perpendicular to BE, which implies that E is the point where the tangent line BE touches the circle. Because the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. Therefore, E is the point of tangency for line BE. Similarly, F is the point of tangency for CF, and X is the point of tangency for AX. Wait, but wait—does that mean that E, F, and X are points on the circle?

Yes, because if the line BE is tangent to the circle O at E, then E lies on the circle. Similarly, F is on the circle, and X is on the circle. Therefore, O is the center, so OE, OF, OX are radii of the circle. Thus, their lengths are equal to the radius r of the circle.

Now, given that, we can use the formula for the length of a tangent from a point to a circle. Wait, but in this case, the lines BE, CF, AX are tangent to the circle. However, points B, C, A are external points from which the tangent lines are drawn. Wait, but if E is the point of tangency, then the distance from B to E is the length of the tangent from point B to the circle. But the length of the tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt[(distance from point to center)^2 - r^2]. 

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that for each tangent line, the square of the length of the tangent from the external point equals the power of the point with respect to the circle. 

For example, for line BE being tangent at E, then BE^2 = OB^2 - r^2. Similarly for CF^2 = OC^2 - r^2, and AX^2 = OA^2 - r^2. But we don't know OB, OC, OA. However, perhaps there's another relationship here.

Wait, but maybe we can relate the lengths BE, CF, AX with the distances from points B, C, A to the center O. But without knowing those distances, how can we proceed?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangles involving the center O and the tangent points. Since OE is perpendicular to BE, and E is on the circle, then triangle OEB is a right triangle with right angle at E. So, OE is the radius r, BE is the tangent length, and OB is the hypotenuse. So, by Pythagoras:

OB² = OE² + BE² → OB² = r² + BE²

Similarly, OC² = r² + CF²

And OA² = r² + AX²

But we don't know OB, OC, OA. However, maybe there are relations between these points?

Looking back at the given lines. There's also Line(A,D) with length 8. But D is a point; we don't know its relation to the circle yet. Maybe D is the center? Wait, but the circle is called O. So O is the center. So D is just another point. Wait, but Line(A,D) is mentioned, and its length is 8. Not sure about that yet.

Alternatively, perhaps there are more connections. Let me think again.

We have three tangent lines: BE, CF, AX. Each has their respective tangent lengths: BE=15, CF=12, AX=x. And each of these tangent lines has a right triangle formed with the center O. 

But how do we connect these? Perhaps there's something missing here. Wait, maybe there's a relation between points A, B, C, D, E, F? Or maybe D is connected to the circle somehow?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(A,D) with length 8. So AD is a line segment of length 8. But how does that tie in? Unless D is related to the circle, like another tangent point? Or perhaps D is the center? But the center is O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express OA in terms of other variables. Suppose we can find expressions for OB, OC, OA in terms of r and the tangent lengths, and then find relations between them.

Let me write down equations:

From BE tangent: OB² = r² + BE² = r² + 15²

From CF tangent: OC² = r² + CF² = r² + 12²

From AX tangent: OA² = r² + x²

But unless we have more info about OB, OC, OA, we can't directly relate them. However, maybe there's another way. Are points A, B, C connected in some way? Like, maybe points A, B, C are colinear or form a triangle? Or perhaps lines connecting them?

Looking back, Line(A,B) is present, Line(A,D) is present, Line(A,X) is present. Also, Line(B,E) and Line(C,F). Not sure yet.

Wait, but Line(A,X) is tangent to the circle. So point X is the point of tangency. So AX is the tangent from A to the circle, touching at X. So the same as before, OA² = r² + x².

But how can we find OA? Unless there's another relation involving OA. For example, if we can find OA in terms of other quantities.

Wait, maybe there's a relation between points A, B, C, D? For instance, Line(A,D) is given with length 8. If D is the center O? Wait, but the circle is named O. So O is the center. So D is another point. Is D connected to the circle? Maybe not necessarily. 

Alternatively, maybe D is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AD? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to the points and see if that helps.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me assume that O is at the origin (0,0). Then, since OE is perpendicular to BE, and E is the point of tangency, so E lies on the circle, and OE is perpendicular to BE. So, vector OE is perpendicular to vector BE. Similarly for OF and OX.

Let me take point E first. Since OE is perpendicular to BE, and E is on the circle. Let me suppose coordinates for E. Let me assume that BE is horizontal or vertical to make things easier. Wait, but maybe I should assign coordinates such that OE is along an axis. For example, let me place E at (r, 0), since OE is a radius. Then, since BE is tangent at E, and OE is perpendicular to BE. So the line BE is perpendicular to OE. Since OE is horizontal (from O(0,0) to E(r,0)), then BE is vertical. Therefore, line BE is vertical, passing through E(r,0). Therefore, point B is somewhere along the vertical line passing through E. Since BE is a tangent, and E is the point of contact. So the line BE is vertical, passing through E(r,0). Therefore, point B is somewhere on that vertical line. Let me denote coordinates for B as (r, b), since it's on the vertical line x=r. The length of BE is the distance between B(r,b) and E(r,0), which is |b - 0| = |b|. Given that BE is 15 units long, so |b|=15. So b is either 15 or -15. Assuming standard position, let's say b is positive, so B is at (r,15).

Similarly, for line CF tangent at F. Let me assume that OF is perpendicular to CF. Let me choose coordinates for F. Let me suppose that OF is along the y-axis. Wait, but if O is at (0,0), then F could be at (0, r) or (0,-r). Let's say F is at (0, r). Then line CF is perpendicular to OF. Since OF is vertical (along y-axis), then line CF is horizontal. Therefore, line CF is horizontal, passing through F(0,r). Therefore, point C is somewhere along the horizontal line y=r. Let me denote C as (c, r). The length of CF is the distance between C(c,r) and F(0,r), which is |c - 0| = |c|. Given that CF is 12, so |c|=12. Let's say c is positive, so C is at (12, r). 

Wait, but then the coordinates of F are (0, r)? Wait, no—if OF is a radius, then F is a point on the circle, so its distance from O is r. If F is at (0, r), then yes, that's a point on the circle. But then line CF is horizontal, so point C is (something, r). 

Now, moving to line AX, which is tangent at X. Similarly, OX is perpendicular to AX. So, OX is the radius at point X, and AX is tangent. Let me assume that OX is along some direction. Let me suppose that X is at (d, e), such that OX is perpendicular to AX. 

But this seems getting complicated. Maybe instead of assigning arbitrary directions, we can find relations between the coordinates.

Alternatively, note that for each tangent line, the length squared is equal to the square of the distance from the external point to the center minus the square of the radius. So:

For BE: Length BE = 15, so BE² = 15² = 225 = OB² - r²

For CF: Length CF = 12, so CF² = 144 = OC² - r²

For AX: Length AX = x, so x² = OA² - r²

Therefore, if we can find OB, OC, OA in terms of r, then we can relate them. However, we need more information to connect these variables.

But what about point A? How is it connected? There's a line AD with length 8. Point D is connected to A via line AD. However, we don't know where D is located. Unless D is related to the circle? For example, if D is another tangent point or something. But the problem doesn't mention D being on the circle. Alternatively, maybe D is the midpoint of some segment? Or maybe AD is related to the center O?

Wait, but the problem gives us Line(A,D) with length 8. So AD = 8. If we can find OA in terms of AD and other variables, maybe?

But how? Let's think. If we can express OA in terms of other variables. Suppose that point D lies somewhere, but we don't have enough info. However, maybe there's another relation. Let me check the given lines again. 

We have Line(A,B), Line(A,X), Line(A,D). So point A is connected to B, X, and D. Also, Line(A,D) has length 8. So AD = 8. But without knowing where D is, it's hard to tell. However, perhaps D is related to the circle? For example, maybe D is the center O? But the circle is called O, so O is the center. So if D were O, then AD would be AO, but the problem didn't state that. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps D is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AD? Not sure.

Wait, but maybe there's another tangent line involved. Wait, the problem mentions Tangent(Line(A,X), Circle(O)). So AX is tangent, which we already considered. But what about other lines? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between points B, C, and A? For example, if points B, C, and A are arranged in a certain way. But without more information, it's tricky.

Wait, let me go back to the earlier equations:

OB² = r² + 15²  
OC² = r² + 12²  
OA² = r² + x²  

If I can find OB and OC in terms of OA or something else... But how?

Wait, maybe there's a relation between OB, OC, and OA through the coordinates. Let me think again about the coordinate setup. Earlier, I tried placing E at (r,0), B at (r,15), F at (0,r), C at (12, r). Let me continue with that. 

In this coordinate system, O is at (0,0). Point B is at (r,15), so the distance OB is sqrt[(r - 0)^2 + (15 - 0)^2] = sqrt(r² + 225). Which matches the equation above: OB² = r² + 225.

Similarly, point C is at (12, r), so OC is sqrt[(12 - 0)^2 + (r - 0)^2] = sqrt(144 + r²), which matches OC² = r² + 144.

Now, what about point A? Where is point A? It is connected to points B, D, and X. Also, AX is tangent to the circle. Let me assume that AX is tangent at point X, which is some point on the circle. Let me denote X as (p, q), lying on the circle, so p² + q² = r². Also, line AX is tangent at X, so OX is perpendicular to AX. The slope of OX is (q - 0)/(p - 0) = q/p. The slope of AX is (q - y_A)/(p - x_A), where A is (x_A, y_A). Since OX is perpendicular to AX, their slopes multiply to -1:

(q/p) * [(q - y_A)/(p - x_A)] = -1

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since AX is tangent to the circle at X, then AX² = OA² - r². So x² = OA² - r². Therefore, if we can find OA in terms of other variables, we can solve for x. 

But how to find OA? Let me think. If I can relate OA with OB or OC. 

Alternatively, maybe points B, C, and A are collinear? Or part of some triangle? Not sure. 

Wait, looking back, there's a line AD with length 8. If I can express AD in terms of OA and something else. For example, if D is the projection of O onto AD, but without knowing where D is, it's unclear. 

Wait, perhaps D is the point where the line AD intersects the circle? But the problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, maybe D is the center O? But then AD would be AO, and AD = 8. But then OA = 8, so x² = OA² - r² = 64 - r². But we need more info to find r. 

But how to find r? From the previous equations:

OB² = r² + 225  
OC² = r² + 144  

If we can find OB and OC in terms of other variables. But how?

Wait, maybe points B and C are related through some geometric property. For example, if lines BE and CF are tangents, and points B and C are connected to A. Maybe triangle ABC? But without knowing angles or other sides, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines AB, AD, and AX are connected in some way. For instance, if D is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AD, but again, not sure.

Wait, going back to the coordinate system idea. Let me assume that point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me try to define coordinates for A. Suppose point A is at (a, b). Then, line AD has length 8, so the distance from A(a,b) to D(d_x, d_y) is 8. But without knowing D's coordinates, it's still unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe D is the intersection of two lines? For example, maybe D is where lines BE and CF intersect? Let me check. Line BE is vertical line x=r (since earlier assumption for E at (r,0) and B at (r,15)), and line CF is horizontal line y=r (since earlier assumption for F at (0,r) and C at (12, r)). Their intersection would be at (r, r). So point D could be (r, r). Then, AD is the line from A(a,b) to D(r, r), with length 8. 

Assuming that D is the intersection of BE and CF, which is (r, r). Then, AD is the segment from A to (r, r), with length 8. 

If that's the case, then we can write the distance between A(a,b) and D(r, r) as sqrt[(a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2] = 8. 

But we need more info about A's location. However, we also know that AX is tangent to the circle at X, and line AX passes through A. 

Additionally, since AX is tangent to the circle, and OX is perpendicular to AX. So, if we can find the coordinates of X, we can relate to A. 

Alternatively, since AX is tangent at X, and OX is perpendicular to AX, then OX · AX = 0 (dot product). 

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try to find relations using the coordinate setup. 

Earlier, we assumed O at (0,0), E at (r,0), B at (r,15), F at (0,r), C at (12, r). Now, if D is the intersection of BE and CF, then D is at (r, r). Then AD is from A(a,b) to D(r, r), length 8. 

Also, AX is tangent to the circle at X. Let me assume that X is some point on the circle. Let me parameterize X as (p, q), satisfying p² + q² = r². The line AX is tangent at X, so the condition is that OX is perpendicular to AX. 

Vector OX is (p, q), and vector AX is (p - a, q - b). Their dot product should be zero:

p(p - a) + q(q - b) = 0  
=> p² - pa + q² - qb = 0  
But since p² + q² = r², substitute:

r² - pa - qb = 0  
=> pa + qb = r². 

So, for any point X on the circle, the equation pa + qb = r² holds. This is the equation of the polar line of point A with respect to the circle. Since AX is tangent, X lies on this polar line. 

However, without knowing the coordinates of A, it's challenging. But maybe we can find more relations. 

We also have that point A is connected to B and to D. 

Point B is at (r,15), and A is connected to B via line AB. So line AB connects A(a,b) to B(r,15). 

Similarly, line AD connects A(a,b) to D(r, r), with length 8. 

Let me write the distance between A and D: sqrt[(a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2] = 8. Squaring gives:

(a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64. ... (1)

Also, since line AB exists, but we don't have its length. However, we can consider that line AB connects A(a,b) to B(r,15). 

Additionally, since AX is tangent to the circle, and we have the relation pa + qb = r² for the tangent point X(p,q). 

But this seems too many variables. Maybe there's another way. 

Let me recall that OA² = r² + x². So OA is the distance from O(0,0) to A(a,b): OA² = a² + b² = r² + x². 

So, a² + b² = r² + x². ... (2)

Also, from equation (1):

(a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64  
Expanding: a² - 2ar + r² + b² - 2br + r² = 64  
Which simplifies to: a² + b² - 2ar - 2br + 2r² = 64. 

Substituting a² + b² from equation (2):

(r² + x²) - 2ar - 2br + 2r² = 64  
Combine terms: 3r² + x² - 2r(a + b) = 64. ... (3)

Now, we need more equations to relate these variables. Let's look for other relations. 

We also have the tangent line AX. Since AX is tangent at X(p,q), and the condition pa + qb = r². 

But also, since X lies on line AX, which goes from A(a,b) to X(p,q). So parametrically, the line AX can be written as (a + t(p - a), b + t(q - b)) for t ≥ 0. Since X is on this line, there exists some t=1 such that it reaches X. 

But this might not be helpful directly. 

Alternatively, since X is on the circle, p² + q² = r². And from the tangent condition, pa + qb = r². 

Let me think: combining these two equations. 

pa + qb = p² + q²  
=> pa + qb = p² + q²  
=> pa + qb - p² - q² = 0  
=> p(a - p) + q(b - q) = 0  

This suggests that the vector from X to A is (a - p, b - q), and the vector from O to X is (p, q), and their dot product is zero. Wait, but that's what we had earlier. 

Not sure. Let me think differently. 

Since AX is tangent at X, then the power of point A with respect to the circle is equal to AX² = OA² - r². So x² = OA² - r² => OA² = x² + r². 

But OA² is also equal to a² + b². So:

a² + b² = x² + r². 

But we also have from equation (3):

3r² + x² - 2r(a + b) = 64. 

Hmm. Still too many variables. Need more relations. 

What about point B? Since point B is at (r,15), and line AB connects A(a,b) to B(r,15). What else do we know about point B? 

From earlier, we had OB² = r² + 15². But OB is the distance from O(0,0) to B(r,15), which is sqrt[r² + 15²], so squaring gives r² + 225. Which matches our earlier equation. 

But how does this help with finding a and b? 

Well, the coordinates of B are (r,15), and A is (a,b). So the line AB connects these points. But we don't know anything about the slope or other properties of AB. 

Unless there's another tangent line or something. Wait, there's also the line AD, which connects A(a,b) to D(r, r), with length 8. 

Maybe we can find another equation involving a and b. 

Let me recap the equations:

Equation (1): (a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64  
Equation (2): a² + b² = x² + r²  
Equation (3): 3r² + x² - 2r(a + b) = 64  

But we need more equations. Maybe from point C? 

Point C is at (12, r), and line CF is tangent at F(0, r). Wait, earlier assumption was F at (0, r). Let me confirm that. 

Earlier, I placed F at (0, r), assuming OF is vertical, making CF horizontal. So CF is horizontal line y=r, passing through F(0, r). Point C is at (12, r). So line CF is from C(12, r) to F(0, r), which is horizontal. The length of CF is 12, which matches. 

Now, what about point A? Is there any connection between A and C? Not directly stated. 

But maybe there's a relation between lines AB and AC? Or some other property. 

Alternatively, since we have two tangent lines BE and CF, and a third tangent line AX, maybe there's a relation between their tangent lengths. 

Wait, in general, for three tangent lines from different points to a circle, but without knowing the positions of those points, it's hard to relate. 

But maybe there's a way to find r. Let me try to combine equations. 

From equation (3): 3r² + x² - 2r(a + b) = 64. 

From equation (2): a² + b² = x² + r². 

Let me rearrange equation (3): 3r² + x² = 64 + 2r(a + b). 

But from equation (2), x² = a² + b² - r². Substitute into equation (3):

3r² + (a² + b² - r²) = 64 + 2r(a + b)  
Simplify left side: 3r² + a² + b² - r² = 2r² + a² + b²  
So: 2r² + a² + b² = 64 + 2r(a + b)  
But from equation (2), a² + b² = x² + r². Substitute:

2r² + x² + r² = 64 + 2r(a + b)  
Which becomes: 3r² + x² = 64 + 2r(a + b)  
Wait, this brings us back to equation (3), so no new info. 

Hmm. So stuck here. Need another equation. 

Let me think about the coordinates of point A. Since we have line AX tangent to the circle, and we've got the condition pa + qb = r². But without knowing X's coordinates, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since AX is tangent, and we know the equation of the tangent line at X. The equation of the tangent line at X(p, q) is px + qy = r². Since point A(a,b) lies on this tangent line, substituting into the tangent equation:

p*a + q*b = r². 

But we also have that X(p, q) is on the circle: p² + q² = r². 

So, we have:

pa + qb = r²  
and  
p² + q² = r². 

These are two equations involving p and q. But without knowing p and q, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if we consider that AX is the tangent line, and A(a,b) is outside the circle, then there are infinitely many points X on the circle such that AX is tangent. But without more constraints, we cannot uniquely determine X. 

Perhaps there's another condition involving point A? Like the fact that AD has length 8. 

Wait, we have point D at (r, r), and AD is from A(a,b) to D(r, r), length 8. Also, we have line AD. Is there any relation between AD and the circle? 

Maybe not directly. But perhaps if we consider that D is the intersection of BE and CF, which we assumed earlier. 

So, with D at (r, r), and AD having length 8, we have equation (1): (a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64. 

But we also have that point A lies outside the circle, so OA² > r², which from equation (2) is x² + r² > r² → x² > 0, which is always true. 

Is there a way to relate a and b with other parts? 

Wait, what about the line AB? Point B is at (r,15), and A is at (a,b). So the line AB connects these points. Does this line have any special property? Not explicitly given. 

Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry or some other geometric property. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that points A, B, C, D are arranged in a way that allows us to find a relation between a and b. 

But this seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. 

Let me recall that for each tangent line, the length squared is equal to the square of the distance from the external point to the center minus the square of the radius. So:

For BE: 15² = OB² - r² → OB² = r² + 225  
For CF: 12² = OC² - r² → OC² = r² + 144  
For AX: x² = OA² - r² → OA² = x² + r²  

Now, if I can find OB and OC in terms of OA, or relate them. 

But how? If points B and C are related to A somehow. 

Alternatively, maybe points B, C, and A are colinear? Or form a triangle with some properties? 

Wait, if I consider the three tangent lines BE, CF, AX. Maybe there's a common point or something? 

Alternatively, perhaps the points B, C, and A are aligned in some way. For example, if lines AB, AD, and AX are related. 

But without more info, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's go back to the coordinate system. We assumed O at (0,0), E at (r,0), B at (r,15), F at (0,r), C at (12, r), D at (r, r). 

Then, AD is from A(a,b) to D(r, r), length 8. 

Also, OA² = a² + b² = x² + r². 

Let me consider that point A is somewhere such that AX is tangent to the circle. Let me assume that X is the point where AX touches the circle. Let me think about the coordinates of X. 

Since AX is tangent at X, and OX is perpendicular to AX. So, vector OX is perpendicular to vector AX. 

Vector OX is (p, q), vector AX is (p - a, q - b). Their dot product is zero:

p(p - a) + q(q - b) = 0  
=> p² - pa + q² - qb = 0  
But since p² + q² = r², this becomes r² - pa - qb = 0 → pa + qb = r². 

So, for point A(a,b), the sum pa + qb = r² for the tangent point X(p,q). 

But this is true for any tangent line from A to the circle. So, if we can find pa + qb = r², but without knowing p and q, it's still not helpful. 

Wait, but if I consider that X is the point of tangency, then the line AX is tangent at X, so the line AX has equation: px + qy = r². Since point A(a,b) lies on this line, so pa + qb = r². 

But also, since X lies on the circle, p² + q² = r². 

So, we have two equations: pa + qb = r² and p² + q² = r². 

Let me think of this as a system of equations. If I treat p and q as variables, then for given a and b, this represents the condition that the line AX is tangent to the circle. 

But how to use this? 

Alternatively, since we have two equations, we can think of it as a quadratic equation. 

Let me isolate one variable. For example, from pa + qb = r², solve for q: q = (r² - pa)/b. Substituting into p² + q² = r²:

p² + [(r² - pa)/b]^2 = r²  
Expand: p² + (r⁴ - 2pa r² + p²a²)/b² = r²  
Multiply through by b²:  
b²p² + r⁴ - 2pa r² + p²a² = r²b²  
Rearrange:  
p²(b² + a²) - 2pa r² + r⁴ - r²b² = 0  
This is a quadratic in p:  
[ a² + b² ]p² - 2a r² p + (r⁴ - r²b²) = 0  
Let me factor terms:  
Let me denote k = a² + b², m = -2a r², n = r⁴ - r²b². So equation is kp² + mp + n = 0. 

But this seems too abstract. 

However, since this equation must have real solutions for p (as there is a tangent point X), the discriminant must be non-negative. 

Discriminant D = m² - 4kn ≥ 0. 

Compute D: (-2a r²)^2 - 4*(a² + b²)*(r⁴ - r²b²) ≥ 0  
Simplify: 4a²r⁴ - 4(a² + b²)(r⁴ - r²b²) ≥ 0  
Divide both sides by 4:  
a²r⁴ - (a² + b²)(r⁴ - r²b²) ≥ 0  
Expand the second term:  
= a²r⁴ - (a² + b²)r⁴ + (a² + b²)r²b² ≥ 0  
Group terms:  
[a²r⁴ - a²r⁴ - b²r⁴] + (a² + b²)r²b² ≥ 0  
Simplify:  
- b²r⁴ + (a² + b²)r²b² ≥ 0  
Factor out r²b²:  
r²b²[-r² + (a² + b²)] ≥ 0  

Since r²b² is non-negative (assuming r ≠ 0 and b is real), the inequality reduces to:  
-r² + (a² + b²) ≥ 0 → a² + b² ≥ r². 

Which is true because OA² = a² + b² = x² + r² ≥ r². 

So this doesn't give new info. 

Back to square one. 

Maybe I need to assume specific values for r. Let me think. 

From equations for OB and OC:

OB² = r² + 225  
OC² = r² + 144  

If I can find OB and OC in terms of other variables. 

But how? Maybe through the coordinates of B and C. 

Point B is at (r,15), so OB is the distance from O(0,0) to B(r,15): sqrt(r² + 15²). 

Point C is at (12, r), so OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(12, r): sqrt(12² + r²). 

But how to relate these to OA? 

If I can find a relationship between OB, OC, and OA. 

For example, if points B, C, and A are colinear, or if there's some geometric relation. 

But without knowing, it's hard. 

Wait, let me think about the line AD. If D is at (r, r), and AD has length 8, then from equation (1): (a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64. 

Also, OA² = a² + b² = x² + r². 

Let me expand (a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = a² - 2ar + r² + b² - 2br + r² = (a² + b²) - 2r(a + b) + 2r² = 64. 

Substitute a² + b² = x² + r²:

(x² + r²) - 2r(a + b) + 2r² = 64  
→ x² + 3r² - 2r(a + b) = 64. 

But this is the same as equation (3). 

Still no progress. 

Wait, but maybe we can find another equation involving a + b. 

If I consider the line AX, and the condition pa + qb = r². 

But without knowing p and q, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if I assume that the tangent line AX is the same as the line AD? No, because AX is tangent, while AD is a line of length 8. 

Wait, but point D is at (r, r). If AD is length 8, and D is (r, r), then perhaps there's a relation between A and D. 

But unless there's more info, I'm stuck. 

Maybe I need to make an assumption about r. Let me think: if I can find r from the equations involving OB and OC. 

But how? 

Wait, if I assume that points B and C are related to A in some way. For example, if line BC is related to AD? Or if there's a common point? 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle formed by B, C, and D has some properties. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, let me try to think numerically. Let me assume some value for r and see if it works. 

Suppose r is some value. Let's say, for example, r = 9. Let's see if that leads anywhere. 

If r = 9, then OB² = 9² + 15² = 81 + 225 = 306 → OB = sqrt(306).  
OC² = 9² + 12² = 81 + 144 = 225 → OC = 15. 

But how does this help? 

If OC is 15, and point C is at (12, r) = (12,9), then OC is sqrt(12² + 9²) = sqrt(144 + 81) = sqrt(225) = 15. Yes, that checks out. 

So r = 9 is possible. 

Now, let's see if we can find a and b. 

From equation (1): (a - 9)^2 + (b - 9)^2 = 64.  
From equation (2): a² + b² = x² + 81.  
From equation (3): 3*81 + x² - 2*9*(a + b) = 64 → 243 + x² - 18(a + b) = 64 → x² - 18(a + b) = -179 → x² = 18(a + b) - 179. 

But we need another equation to relate a + b and x. 

But we also have the condition from the tangent line AX: pa + qb = r² = 81. 

But without knowing p and q, it's hard. 

Alternatively, let's assume that point A lies on the line joining B and C? Or some other line? 

If I assume that A is somewhere such that line AB and line AC are related. 

But without knowing, it's too speculative. 

Wait, but if OC = 15, and OC is the distance from O to C, which is 15. And earlier, we saw that OC² = r² + 12², so with r=9, this holds. 

Now, what about point B? Its distance from O is sqrt(r² + 15²) = sqrt(81 + 225) = sqrt(306) ≈ 17.49. 

Now, if I assume that point A is such that line AD has length 8, and D is at (9,9) (since r=9). So (a-9)^2 + (b-9)^2 = 64. 

Let me pick a simple case where a = 9 + 8 = 17, b = 9. Then, (17-9)^2 + (9-9)^2 = 8² + 0 = 64. So a=17, b=9. 

Then, OA² = 17² + 9² = 289 + 81 = 370. So x² = OA² - r² = 370 - 81 = 289 → x = 17. But 17 isn't one of the options. 

Alternatively, if a=9, b=9+8=17. Then, (9-9)^2 + (17-9)^2 = 0 + 64 = 64. So a=9, b=17. Then OA² = 9² + 17² = 81 + 289 = 370, same as above. x² = 370 - 81 = 289 → x=17. Still not matching options. 

But the options are A.7.2, B.8, C.12, D.15. So 17 is not among them. 

Maybe my assumption of r=9 is wrong. Let me try another r. 

Let me try to find r such that the equations are consistent. 

From the earlier equations, if I assume that r is such that OC = 15, then r² + 12² = 15² → r² = 225 - 144 = 81 → r = 9. Which is what I did earlier. 

But with this, x came out as 17, which isn't an option. So maybe this approach is incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way to find r. Let me think. 

If I assume that points B, C, and D are related. For example, if line BD is something? Or if there's a right triangle? 

Alternatively, since D is at (r, r), and AD is length 8, and point A is at (a,b), then (a - r)^2 + (b - r)^2 = 64. 

Also, from the tangent condition for AX: pa + qb = r². 

But without knowing p and q, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but if I assume that X is the same as D? No, because D is on the line AD, and X is a point of tangency. Unless D is the point of tangency. But why would that be? 

If D is the point of tangency, then line AD would be tangent at D, so OD is perpendicular to AD. But OD is from O(0,0) to D(r, r), so the slope of OD is r/r = 1. So the slope of AD should be -1 (negative reciprocal). 

So, if AD is perpendicular to OD, then the line AD has slope -1. 

Given that D is at (r, r), and A is at (a, b), then the slope of AD is (r - b)/(r - a) = -1. 

Thus: (r - b)/(r - a) = -1 → r - b = -(r - a) → r - b = -r + a → 2r = a + b → a + b = 2r. 

So, if D is the point of tangency, then this
