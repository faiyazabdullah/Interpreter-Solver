<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle XYZ with centroid P. We know KP = 3, XJ = 8, and there's some ratio involving XP and PJ. The question is asking for YJ. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall what a centroid is. The centroid of a triangle is the intersection point of the medians, and it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, where the longer part is closer to the vertex. So, if P is the centroid, then each median is split into segments with the centroid being twice as far from the vertex as it is from the midpoint of the opposite side.

Now, looking at the given information: There's a line XJ. Wait, but XJ isn't necessarily a median unless J is the midpoint of some side. But the problem mentions points J, L, K, etc., connected via lines. Let me check the predicates again. The lines given are Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,X) — so XYZ forms a triangle. Then Line(X,J), Line(Y,L), Line(Z,K). Hmm, so J, L, K are points connected to X, Y, Z respectively. Are these medians? Because if J is the midpoint of YZ, then XJ would be a median. Similarly for L and K?

Wait, the centroid is the intersection of the medians. So maybe J, L, K are midpoints? Or perhaps they're other points. Wait, but the problem says IsCentroidOf(P, Triangle(X,Y,Z)), so P is the centroid. Also, there's a line KP with length 3. And the ratio of XP to PJ is 2:1. 

Let me think. Since P is the centroid, any median would be divided by P into a 2:1 ratio. For example, if we consider the median from X to the midpoint of YZ, then the centroid divides that median into XP:Pmidpoint = 2:1. However, here we have a line XJ. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then XJ would be a median. Then, the segment XP would be two-thirds of the median XJ, and PJ would be one-third. But wait, the ratio given is RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(X,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,J)), 2, 1). That means XP / PJ = 2/1. Which aligns with the centroid property. So that suggests that XJ is a median, and P lies on it. Therefore, J must be the midpoint of YZ. 

So, since XJ is a median, and P is the centroid, then XP is twice PJ. Given that XJ = 8, which is the entire length of the median. So if XP + PJ = XJ, and XP/PJ = 2/1, then XP = (2/3)*XJ = (2/3)*8 = 16/3 ≈ 5.333... and PJ = 8 - 16/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...

But wait, the problem also states that KP = 3. Now, K is connected via Line(Z,K). So K is another point; perhaps K is the midpoint of XY? Because if we consider the median from Z to the midpoint of XY, then the centroid divides that median into a 2:1 ratio. So if K is the midpoint of XY, then ZK is a median, and P lies on it. Then, PK would be one-third of the median ZK. So PK = 3 implies that the length of ZK is 3*3=9? Wait, because the centroid divides the median into 2:1, so from the vertex to centroid is 2 parts, and centroid to midpoint is 1 part. So if PK is the segment from centroid to midpoint, then PK = 1/3 of the median. Hence, the entire median ZK would be 3 * PK = 3*3=9. Therefore, the length of median ZK is 9.

But how does this relate to finding YJ? Let me see. YJ is another segment. Wait, YJ could be a different line. Wait, the problem asks for YJ. Let me think about what YJ represents. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ would be half of YZ. Wait, no. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ is half the length of YZ. But we don't know YZ yet. Alternatively, maybe YJ is not directly related to the medians. Wait, but how do we find YJ?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place the triangle XYZ in coordinate plane. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Suppose we take X at (0, 0), Y at (a, 0), Z at (b, c). Then the centroid P has coordinates ((a + b)/3, (c)/3). Wait, but maybe that's too general. Alternatively, since we have some given lengths, perhaps we can assign coordinates such that certain points are easy to handle.

But perhaps there's a better approach using vectors or ratios. Let me think again about the medians.

Since P is the centroid, and we know that XJ is a median (assuming J is the midpoint of YZ), then as per the ratio given, XP : PJ = 2:1. Also, XJ is given as 8, so XJ = 8. Then, the entire median XJ is 8, so XP = (2/3)*8 = 16/3, and PJ = 8/3. But the problem also gives KP = 3. Where is K located? The line ZK is mentioned. If K is the midpoint of XY, then ZK is another median. The centroid divides this median into a 2:1 ratio, so PK would be one-third of ZK. Since KP = 3, then ZK = 3 * 3 = 9. So the median from Z to midpoint of XY is 9 units long.

Now, how does this help us find YJ? Well, YJ is a segment. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ is half of YZ. But we need to find YJ. Wait, but how can we relate this to the other information?

Alternatively, maybe we can use Apollonius's theorem, which relates the lengths of the medians to the sides of the triangle. Apollonius’s theorem states that the sum of the squares of the medians equals three times the sum of the squares of the sides. Wait, more specifically, for any triangle, the sum of the squares of the medians is equal to three-quarters of the sum of the squares of the sides. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.

Alternatively, since we know two medians' lengths (XJ = 8 and ZK = 9), perhaps we can find relations between them and the sides of the triangle. But we need to find YJ. Wait, YJ is not a median unless J is the midpoint of YZ. If that's the case, then YJ is half of YZ. But without knowing YZ, how can we proceed?

Wait, maybe there's something missing here. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "Line(X,J)", so J is connected to X. But J is not necessarily the midpoint. Wait, but earlier assumption was that J is the midpoint because the ratio XP/PJ = 2:1, which is characteristic of a centroid lying on a median. So if XJ is a median, then J is the midpoint of YZ. Therefore, YJ is half the length of YZ. But how to find YZ?

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the medians in terms of the sides. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let’s call the sides opposite to X, Y, Z as y, z, x respectively. Wait, standard notation is usually lowercase letters for sides opposite uppercase vertices. So, side opposite X is YZ, which would be denoted as a, side opposite Y is XZ, denoted as b, and side opposite Z is XY, denoted as c.

But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then the median XJ has length 8. The formula for the length of a median in terms of the sides of the triangle is:

m_a^2 = (2b² + 2c² - a²)/4

Where m_a is the median from vertex A to side a. In our case, the median from X to YZ (which is side a). So if XJ is the median, then its length squared is (2b² + 2c² - a²)/4 = 8² = 64.

Similarly, the median from Z to XY (side c) is ZK, which we found to be 9. So its length squared is (2a² + 2b² - c²)/4 = 9² = 81.

But we have two equations here, but three variables (a, b, c). Unless we can find another equation. But we don't have info about the third median or other sides. So maybe this approach isn't sufficient.

Wait, but maybe we can find another relation. Also, note that the centroid divides the medians in 2:1 ratio. But how does that connect to the given KP = 3?

Wait, K is the midpoint of XY (since ZK is a median), so the centroid P divides ZK into 2:1. So the distance from Z to P is 2/3 of ZK, and from P to K is 1/3 of ZK. Since KP = 3, then ZK = 9, as before. So that gives us the median from Z to XY is 9. So that's one median length.

We also have the median from X to YZ is 8. So we have two medians. But we need to find YJ, which is half of YZ (if J is the midpoint). So YJ = a/2, where a is the length of YZ. So if we can find a, then YJ is a/2.

So, let's write the equations for the medians:

For median from X to YZ (median XJ):

m_x = 8 = sqrt[(2b² + 2c² - a²)/4]

For median from Z to XY (median ZK):

m_z = 9 = sqrt[(2a² + 2b² - c²)/4]

So squaring both equations:

For m_x:

(2b² + 2c² - a²)/4 = 64 → 2b² + 2c² - a² = 256 ...(1)

For m_z:

(2a² + 2b² - c²)/4 = 81 → 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324 ...(2)

Now, we have two equations with three variables. How can we find a?

Wait, but maybe there's another relation. Let's consider the third median. The median from Y to XZ. Let me denote that as m_y. However, we don't have information about it. But perhaps we can find it in terms of other variables. Alternatively, maybe we can combine equations (1) and (2).

Let me write equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): 2b² + 2c² - a² = 256

Equation (2): 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324

Hmm. Let me try to subtract or add these equations to eliminate variables. Let me denote:

Let me rearrange equation (1):

- a² + 2b² + 2c² = 256

Equation (2): 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324

Let me multiply equation (1) by 2 to get:

-2a² + 4b² + 4c² = 512 ... (1a)

Then add equation (2) to (1a):

(-2a² + 4b² + 4c²) + (2a² + 2b² - c²) = 512 + 324

This simplifies to:

(-2a² + 2a²) + (4b² + 2b²) + (4c² - c²) = 836

Which becomes:

0 + 6b² + 3c² = 836 → Divide both sides by 3:

2b² + c² = 836 / 3 ≈ 278.666...

But this seems messy. Maybe there's another way. Let me think if there's another relation.

Alternatively, suppose we treat a, b, c as variables. But since we have two equations and three variables, it's underdetermined. However, we are trying to find a, which is YZ. Perhaps we can find another equation using the fact that the centroid divides the medians in ratio 2:1. Wait, but we already used that in the median lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the medians. But I don't recall a direct formula connecting two medians without the third.

Wait, but maybe we can express the third median in terms of a, b, c. Let me denote the third median from Y to XZ (let's call it m_y). Its formula would be:

m_y² = (2a² + 2c² - b²)/4

But without knowing m_y, this doesn't help directly. However, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, since we have two equations, maybe we can find a combination that allows us to find a. Let me try substituting variables.

From equation (1): 2b² + 2c² = 256 + a²

From equation (2): 2a² + 2b² = 324 + c²

Let me denote equation (1) as:

2b² + 2c² = a² + 256 ...(1)

And equation (2):

2a² + 2b² = c² + 324 ...(2)

Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

[2b² + 2c²] - [2a² + 2b²] = (a² + 256) - (c² + 324)

Left side: 2c² - 2a²

Right side: a² + 256 - c² - 324 = a² - c² - 68

Thus:

2c² - 2a² = a² - c² - 68

Bring all terms to left:

2c² - 2a² - a² + c² + 68 = 0 → 3c² - 3a² + 68 = 0 → 3(c² - a²) = -68 → c² - a² = -68/3 → a² - c² = 68/3 ...(3)

Now, from equation (2): 2a² + 2b² = c² + 324 → 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324. Let me substitute c² from equation (3): c² = a² - 68/3.

Substituting into equation (2):

2a² + 2b² - (a² - 68/3) = 324 → 2a² + 2b² - a² + 68/3 = 324 → a² + 2b² + 68/3 = 324 → a² + 2b² = 324 - 68/3 = (972/3 - 68/3) = 904/3 ...(4)

Now, from equation (1): 2b² + 2c² = a² + 256. Again, replace c² with a² - 68/3:

2b² + 2(a² - 68/3) = a² + 256 → 2b² + 2a² - 136/3 = a² + 256 → 2b² + a² - 136/3 = 256 → 2b² + a² = 256 + 136/3 = (768/3 + 136/3) = 904/3 ...(5)

Comparing equations (4) and (5), we have:

From (4): a² + 2b² = 904/3

From (5): same thing. So they are consistent, but no new information. Thus, we still have one equation with two variables. So we cannot find unique values for a and b. Therefore, maybe this approach isn't working. 

Perhaps there's another way. Let me think back to the original problem. The question is asking for YJ. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ = YZ / 2. So if we can find YZ, then we can divide by 2 to get YJ. But how?

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship we haven't considered. Let me think about vector coordinates. Suppose we set up coordinates with centroid P at origin. Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me consider mass point geometry. Since P is the centroid, masses at vertices would be proportional to 1 each, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the medians intersect at centroid, and the given KP = 3. Since K is the midpoint of XY, and ZK is a median of length 9. Let me think about the coordinates again.

Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point X at (0, 0), Y at (y, 0), and Z at (z_x, z_y). Then, the midpoint of YZ would be J. Coordinates of J would be [(y + z_x)/2, (0 + z_y)/2]. The median XJ goes from X(0,0) to J. The length of XJ is 8. Also, the centroid P divides this median in a 2:1 ratio, so P is located at 2/3 along the median from X to J. So coordinates of P would be [(2*(y+z_x)/3), (2*z_y)/3].

Also, the midpoint of XY is K. Since X is (0,0) and Y is (y,0), the midpoint K is at (y/2, 0). The median from Z to K is ZK. The coordinates of Z are (z_x, z_y), and K is (y/2, 0). The length of ZK is 9. So the distance between Z(z_x, z_y) and K(y/2, 0) is sqrt[(z_x - y/2)^2 + (z_y - 0)^2] = sqrt[(z_x - y/2)^2 + z_y^2] = 9.

Additionally, the centroid P lies on this median ZK. The coordinates of P should also lie on the line ZK. Let me parametrize the line ZK. Parametric equations: starting at Z(z_x, z_y) and going to K(y/2, 0). The vector from Z to K is (y/2 - z_x, -z_y). So any point on ZK can be expressed as Z + t*(vector ZK), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Since P is the centroid, it lies on this median. From earlier, P's coordinates are [(2*(y+z_x))/3, (2*z_y)/3]. This point must satisfy the parametric form of ZK. Let me write the parametric equations:

x-coordinate: z_x + t*(y/2 - z_x) = [z_x*(1 - t)] + t*y/2

y-coordinate: z_y + t*(-z_y) = z_y*(1 - t)

Set this equal to P's coordinates:

z_x*(1 - t) + t*y/2 = (2(y + z_x))/3

and

z_y*(1 - t) = (2 z_y)/3

Assuming z_y ≠ 0 (otherwise the triangle would be degenerate), we can divide both sides of the second equation by z_y:

(1 - t) = 2/3 → t = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3

So t = 1/3. Plugging this into the first equation:

z_x*(1 - 1/3) + (1/3)*(y/2) = 2(y + z_x)/3

Compute left side:

z_x*(2/3) + y/(6) = (2z_x)/3 + y/6

Right side: 2(y + z_x)/3 = 2y/3 + 2z_x/3

So equate both sides:

(2z_x)/3 + y/6 = 2y/3 + 2z_x/3

Subtract (2z_x)/3 from both sides:

y/6 = 2y/3 → Multiply both sides by 6:

y = 4y → 4y - y = 0 → 3y = 0 → y = 0

Wait, that can't be right. If y = 0, then Y would be at (0, 0), same as X, making the triangle degenerate. That suggests an error in my assumptions. What did I do wrong?

Let me check the parametric equations again. The coordinates of P were determined earlier as [(2(y + z_x))/3, (2 z_y)/3], assuming that the centroid divides the median XJ in a 2:1 ratio. But wait, the centroid divides the median from X to J in a 2:1 ratio, so from X to P is twice the length of P to J. So if the entire median XJ is 8, then XP = 16/3 and PJ = 8/3. So the coordinates of P should be located at 2/3 from X to J. So yes, the calculation for P's coordinates is correct.

But when I plugged into the parametric equation for ZK, I got an inconsistency leading to y = 0. That suggests that either my coordinate setup has an error, or there's a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the parametric equations. Let me re-express the parametric equations for ZK. Starting at Z(z_x, z_y) and ending at K(y/2, 0). So the direction vector is (y/2 - z_x, -z_y). So parametric equations for any point on ZK is:

x = z_x + t*(y/2 - z_x)

y = z_y + t*(-z_y) = z_y*(1 - t)

At parameter t = 1/3, the point is:

x = z_x + (1/3)(y/2 - z_x) = (2z_x)/3 + y/6

y = z_y*(1 - 1/3) = (2 z_y)/3

Which matches the coordinates of P from the median XJ. So that's correct. So setting this equal to P's coordinates gives:

x = (2z_x)/3 + y/6 = (2(y + z_x))/3 ?

Wait, the x-coordinate of P is supposed to be (2*(y + z_x))/3? No, that's incorrect. Earlier, I thought P's x-coordinate was (2*(y + z_x))/3, but actually, J is the midpoint of YZ. Let me recalculate the coordinates of P properly.

J is the midpoint of YZ. Y is at (y, 0), Z is at (z_x, z_y). So midpoint J has coordinates:

J_x = (y + z_x)/2, J_y = (0 + z_y)/2 = z_y/2.

Then, the median XJ goes from X(0,0) to J((y + z_x)/2, z_y/2). The centroid P divides this median in a 2:1 ratio, so P is located at 2/3 from X to J. Therefore, coordinates of P are:

P_x = 0 + (2/3)*[(y + z_x)/2 - 0] = (2/3)*(y + z_x)/2 = (y + z_x)/3

P_y = 0 + (2/3)*(z_y/2 - 0) = (2/3)*(z_y/2) = z_y/3

So P's coordinates are ((y + z_x)/3, z_y/3)

Earlier, I had mistakenly written (2(y + z_x))/3, which was wrong. The correct x-coordinate is (y + z_x)/3. So that was the error!

So correcting that, let's plug into the parametric equations. At t = 1/3, the x-coordinate from ZK parametric equations is:

x = z_x + (1/3)*(y/2 - z_x) = z_x - (1/3)z_x + y/6 = (2z_x)/3 + y/6

Which must equal P_x = (y + z_x)/3

So:

(2z_x)/3 + y/6 = (y + z_x)/3

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:

4z_x + y = 2y + 2z_x

Rearranging:

4z_x + y - 2y - 2z_x = 0 → 2z_x - y = 0 → y = 2z_x

Ah! So this gives a relationship between y and z_x: y = 2z_x.

That's a crucial relation. So now we can use this to simplify further.

So we have y = 2z_x.

Now, let's recall that the length of ZK is 9. The coordinates of Z are (z_x, z_y), and K is (y/2, 0). Since y = 2z_x, then K is at ( (2z_x)/2, 0 ) = (z_x, 0). So ZK connects (z_x, z_y) to (z_x, 0). Therefore, the distance between Z(z_x, z_y) and K(z_x, 0) is simply the vertical distance, which is |z_y - 0| = |z_y|. So ZK has length |z_y| = 9. Therefore, z_y = ±9. Assuming the triangle is oriented normally, we can take z_y = 9.

So z_y = 9.

Now, we have y = 2z_x. Let's keep that in mind.

Now, we also know that the length of XJ is 8. XJ is the median from X(0,0) to J, which is midpoint of YZ. J's coordinates are ((y + z_x)/2, z_y/2). Since y = 2z_x, then:

J_x = (2z_x + z_x)/2 = (3z_x)/2

J_y = z_y / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5

Therefore, the coordinates of J are (3z_x/2, 4.5). The length of XJ is the distance from X(0,0) to J(3z_x/2, 4.5). Using the distance formula:

XJ^2 = (3z_x/2 - 0)^2 + (4.5 - 0)^2 = (9z_x²)/4 + 20.25 = 64 (given that XJ = 8)

So:

9z_x² / 4 + 20.25 = 64 → 9z_x² / 4 = 64 - 20.25 = 43.75 → 9z_x² = 43.75 * 4 = 175 → z_x² = 175 / 9 → z_x = ±√(175/9) = ±(5√7)/3

But since z_x can be positive or negative, but we can choose coordinates such that z_x is positive, so let's take z_x = 5√7 / 3.

Now, we need to find YJ. YJ is the distance from Y to J. Y is at (y, 0) = (2z_x, 0), and J is at (3z_x/2, 4.5). So compute this distance.

Coordinates of Y: (2z_x, 0)

Coordinates of J: (3z_x/2, 9/2)

Difference in x-coordinates: 3z_x/2 - 2z_x = 3z_x/2 - 4z_x/2 = -z_x/2

Difference in y-coordinates: 9/2 - 0 = 9/2

So YJ^2 = (-z_x/2)^2 + (9/2)^2 = (z_x²)/4 + 81/4

We already know that z_x² = 175/9.

Plugging in:

YJ^2 = (175/9)/4 + 81/4 = 175/(36) + 81/4 = convert to common denominator:

Convert 81/4 to 729/36. So total YJ² = 175/36 + 729/36 = (175 + 729)/36 = 904/36 = 226/9

So YJ = sqrt(226/9) = √(226)/3 ≈ 15.03/3 ≈ 5.01. Wait, but none of the options are close to this. The answer choices are A.3, B.6, C.8, D.9. This suggests that my calculation is wrong somewhere, or perhaps I misunderstood the configuration.

Wait, but this can't be. There must be an error. Let me check my steps again.

First, I assumed that J is the midpoint of YZ, which led to the median XJ having length 8. Then, with ZK being a median of length 9, and deriving that y = 2z_x. Then, computing YJ as the distance between Y(2z_x, 0) and J(3z_x/2, 9/2). Let me recompute YJ.

YJ^2 = [ (2z_x - 3z_x/2)^2 + (0 - 9/2)^2 ] = [ (z_x/2)^2 + (9/2)^2 ]

Wait, earlier I said difference in x was -z_x/2, so square is (z_x/2)^2. Yes. So YJ^2 = z_x²/4 + 81/4.

With z_x² = 175/9, then:

YJ^2 = (175/9)/4 + 81/4 = 175/(36) + 81/4 = 175/36 + 729/36 = 904/36 = 226/9.

Wait, 904 divided by 36 is approximately 25.111..., so YJ is sqrt(25.111...) ≈ 5.01, which is not among the answer choices. Clearly, something is wrong here.

But the answer choices are integers, so likely I made a wrong assumption. Let me go back.

Maybe my assumption that J is the midpoint of YZ is incorrect? Wait, but the ratio given is XP:PJ = 2:1, which is the property of the centroid dividing the median into 2:1. So if XJ is a median, then J must be the midpoint of YZ. So why am I getting an answer not matching the choices?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the parametric equations. Let me double-check.

When I computed the coordinates of P from the median XJ, I said P_x = (y + z_x)/3. With y = 2z_x, this becomes (2z_x + z_x)/3 = 3z_x/3 = z_x. So P_x = z_x. And P_y = z_y/3 = 9/3 = 3. So P is at (z_x, 3). 

Now, the coordinates of K are (z_x, 0), as previously determined. So the line ZK is from Z(z_x, 9) to K(z_x, 0), which is a vertical line at x=z_x. The centroid P is at (z_x, 3), which lies on this line. So that checks out.

Now, the length of KP is the distance from K(z_x, 0) to P(z_x, 3), which is sqrt((z_x - z_x)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = 3. Which matches the given KP = 3. So that part is correct.

Now, the length of XJ is 8. X is at (0,0), J is at (3z_x/2, 9/2). So distance XJ is sqrt[(3z_x/2)^2 + (9/2)^2] = 8. Squared: (9z_x²)/4 + 81/4 = 64 → 9z_x² + 81 = 256 → 9z_x² = 175 → z_x² = 175/9. Correct.

Now, YJ is the distance from Y(2z_x, 0) to J(3z_x/2, 9/2). Let me calculate this again:

Δx = 3z_x/2 - 2z_x = 3z_x/2 - 4z_x/2 = -z_x/2

Δy = 9/2 - 0 = 9/2

So YJ^2 = (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 = (z_x/2)^2 + (9/2)^2 = z_x²/4 + 81/4 = (175/9)/4 + 81/4 = 175/(36) + 81/4 = 175/36 + 729/36 = 904/36 = 226/9. So YJ = sqrt(226)/3 ≈ 15.03/3 ≈ 5.01. Not matching any answer choice. This suggests that either there's a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the problem.

Wait, the problem says "Find YJ". But according to this, it's around 5.01, which is not among the options. But the answer choices are A.3, B.6, C.8, D.9. So clearly, there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me reconsider the initial assumption. Maybe J is not the midpoint of YZ. What if XJ is not a median? But the ratio XP:PJ = 2:1 suggests that P lies on the median from X to the midpoint of YZ. So unless XJ is not a median, but some other line. But how can that be? 

Wait, the problem states Line(X,J). It doesn't say that J is the midpoint. So maybe J is not the midpoint, but some other point on the line XJ, and the centroid divides this line in 2:1 ratio. But in that case, J wouldn't be the midpoint, but another point. Let me think.

Let me denote that XJ is a line segment, and P is the centroid lying on it, such that XP:PJ = 2:1. But this would mean that J is not the midpoint of YZ, but some other point. So perhaps XJ is not a median, but another line. But then how does this relate to the rest of the problem?

Alternatively, maybe J is the midpoint of XY? No, because then XJ would be a median from X to midpoint of XY, but that would be a different median. Wait, but in that case, the median from X to midpoint of XY would be a different line. But then, the centroid divides this median into 2:1, so the length from X to P would be 2/3 of the median. But then, the length of XJ would be the full median length. But then, how does this fit with the other conditions?

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the lines mentioned. The problem includes Line(X,J), Line(Y,L), Line(Z,K). These could be medians, or other lines. But if P is the centroid, then it lies on all three medians. So if XJ is a median, then J must be the midpoint of YZ. Similarly, if ZK is a median, then K is the midpoint of XY. And if YL is a median, then L is the midpoint of XZ. 

Given that, then with P being the centroid, the three medians are XJ, YL, ZK. So the length of XJ is 8, and length of ZK is 9. Then, we can use the properties of medians to find relations between the sides.

Let me revisit the earlier approach with the medians. Let me denote the lengths of the medians:

Let m_x = length of median from X to YZ = 8.

m_z = length of median from Z to XY = 9.

As before, using the median formula:

For median from X to YZ (m_x):

m_x² = (2b² + 2c² - a²)/4 = 64 → 2b² + 2c² - a² = 256 ...(1)

For median from Z to XY (m_z):

m_z² = (2a² + 2b² - c²)/4 = 81 → 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324 ...(2)

We also know that the third median, from Y to XZ, let's call it m_y, satisfies:

m_y² = (2a² + 2c² - b²)/4.

But we don't have info about m_y. However, perhaps there's another relation. Let me try adding equations (1) and (2):

From (1): 2b² + 2c² - a² = 256

From (2): 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324

Adding them:

(2b² + 2c² - a²) + (2a² + 2b² - c²) = 256 + 324 → 4b² + c² + a² = 580 ...(3)

Not sure if helpful. Let me try subtracting (2) from (1):

(2b² + 2c² - a²) - (2a² + 2b² - c²) = 256 - 324 → 3c² - 3a² = -68 → c² - a² = -68/3 → a² = c² + 68/3 ...(4)

Now, from equation (2): 2a² + 2b² - c² = 324. Substituting a² from (4):

2(c² + 68/3) + 2b² - c² = 324 → 2c² + 136/3 + 2b² - c² = 324 → c² + 2b² + 136/3 = 324 → 2b² + c² = 324 - 136/3 = (972/3 - 136/3) = 836/3 ...(5)

Now, from equation (1): 2b² + 2c² - a² = 256. Substitute a² from (4):

2b² + 2c² - (c² + 68/3) = 256 → 2b² + c² - 68/3 = 256 → 2b² + c² = 256 + 68/3 = (768/3 + 68/3) = 836/3 ...(6)

Which matches equation (5), so no new info. Hence, we still can't find individual values of a, b, c.

But we need to find YJ. If J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ = a/2. So if we can find a, we can find YJ.

But how?

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between the medians and the sides. Let me recall that the formula for the length of the median can also be combined with the lengths of the other medians. But without more information, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the centroid divides the medians in 2:1, and using the given KP = 3. Since K is the midpoint of XY, and ZK is a median of length 9, and KP is 1/3 of ZK, which is 3, as given. So that part is satisfied. 

But how does this help with finding YJ?

Wait, maybe I should consider the coordinates approach again, but this time not assume anything about the position of J. Let me try once more.

Let me place the centroid P at (0, 0) for simplicity. Since P is the centroid, the coordinates of P are the average of the vertices' coordinates. So if P is at (0, 0), then:

X + Y + Z = 3P = (0, 0). So X + Y + Z = (0, 0).

Let me denote the coordinates of X, Y, Z as vectors. Let me call them x, y, z. So x + y + z = 0.

Now, the line XJ passes through P, and XP:PJ = 2:1. So the vector from X to P is 2/3 of the vector from X to J. Let me denote J as a point on the line extended from X through P. Wait, since P is on XJ, and XP:PJ = 2:1, then P divides XJ in the ratio XP:PJ = 2:1. So if we consider vectorially, P = X + 2/3 (J - X). Rearranged, this gives J = X + 3/2 (P - X). Since P is the origin, this simplifies to J = X + 3/2 (-X) = X - 3X/2 = -X/2. So J = -X/2.

Wait, this suggests that J is the point such that vector XJ is 3/2 times the vector from X to P. Since P is the origin, this means J = X + 3/2 * (-X) = -X/2. So J is at -X/2.

Similarly, if K is the midpoint of XY, then since ZK is a median, and P is on ZK, with KP = 3. Let me try to express K. Since K is the midpoint of XY, K = (X + Y)/2.

But since x + y + z = 0, we can write z = -x - y.

Now, the median from Z to K is the line from Z to K. P lies on this median, and KP = 3. Let me find the coordinates of P on this median.

Parametrize the line from Z to K. Let me represent it as Z + t(K - Z). P is a point on this line. Let me find t such that P is on this line.

Let me denote the vector from Z to K as K - Z = (X+Y)/2 - Z = (X + Y)/2 - (-X - Y) = (X + Y)/2 + X + Y = (X + Y)/2 + 2(X + Y)/2 = 3(X + Y)/2. So the vector from Z to K is 3(X + Y)/2.

So the parametric equation for the line ZK is Z + t*[3(X + Y)/2]. Since P is on this line, we can write P = Z + t*[3(X + Y)/2].

But P is the origin (0,0), so:

0 = Z + t*[3(X + Y)/2]

=> Z = -t*[3(X + Y)/2]

But Z = -X - Y, from earlier. So:

-X - Y = -t*[3(X + Y)/2]

Divide both sides by -(X + Y) (assuming X + Y ≠ 0):

1 = t*[3/2] => t = 2/3

So substituting back:

Z = - (2/3)*[3(X + Y)/2] = - (X + Y)

Which is consistent with Z = -X - Y. So this confirms consistency.

Now, the length KP is the distance from K to P. Since K is (X + Y)/2, and P is origin, then KP
