MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have a circle M with several points on it: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P. Lines connecting these points are mentioned, like FL, HJ, HP, PJ, ML, MN. Also, there are right angles at M for angles MLF and MNp. The lengths of FL is 24, HJ is 48. Points F, L, H, J, K, P, N are on the circle. Also, M is the center since it's stated as IsCenterOf. So, ML and MN are radii because they're from the center to the circumference. Since FL is a chord, its length is 24, so the radius would be half of that? Wait, wait. Wait, ML is a radius, but FL is a chord. Let me think. 

Wait, FL is a chord of the circle with midpoint at L. Because IsMidpointOf says Point L is the midpoint of line FL. So FL is a chord where L is its midpoint. But if L is the midpoint, then ML is perpendicular to FL? Because in a circle, the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. Wait, yes! That's a key property. Similarly, MN is a radius and N is the midpoint of some chord? Wait, looking back, IsMidpointOf says Point N is the midpoint of line PJ. So line PJ has midpoint N. And since MN is a radius, that means MN is perpendicular to PJ. 

So, first, let me note down all the given data:

- Circle centered at M.
- Chords FL, HJ, HP, PJ.
- FL length is 24, so since L is midpoint, FL is a chord with midpoint L. Therefore, ML is perpendicular to FL. Similarly, MN is perpendicular to PJ because N is the midpoint of PJ. 
- HJ is a chord of length 48. Since H and J are points on the circle, and HJ is a chord. Also, there's a line HP and PJ. So H-P-J forms another chord? Or maybe HJ is split into segments? Wait, HJ is a line segment. Also, HP and PJ are lines. Wait, HJ is a line, and H-P-J is another line? Maybe H, P, J are colinear? Because line HJ is given, and also lines HP and PJ. So H-P-J is part of the same line HJ? Wait, line HJ is one line, and lines HP and PJ are two other lines. But if P is a point such that HP and PJ are lines, then P lies on HJ? Because if H, P, J are colinear, then HJ is the same line as HP and PJ. So that suggests that P is a point on the line HJ. 

But then, the chord HJ is 48 units long. Now, we're told that m∠HP is 65 degrees. Wait, the question says m∠H P = 65. Wait, the notation might mean the measure of arc HP? Or maybe the angle at P? Wait, the original problem says "m ∠H P = 65". But angles in circles can refer to central angles, inscribed angles, or arcs. However, the way it's written, maybe it's referring to the arc HP. Alternatively, maybe it's an angle formed by points H, P, and something else. But given that there's a circle involved, and points H and P are on the circle, perhaps it's referring to the arc measure. 

Alternatively, since there are lines HP and PJ, maybe there's an angle at P. For example, angle HPJ or something. But the notation could be ambiguous. However, considering the answer options involve numbers like 65, 85, etc., and given that arcs can be measured in degrees, it's likely that m∠HP refers to the measure of arc HP. But I need to confirm.

Wait, the problem says "Find m ∠PJ." Wait, the original question is "Find m ∠PJ." Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m ∠PJ." Wait, the actual question is about the measure of arc PJ? Or angle at P? Let me check again.

Original question: "In ⊙M, FL = 24, HJ = 48, and m ∠HP = 65. Find m ∠PJ."

Wait, the user wrote "m ∠HP" and asks for "m ∠PJ". So, the measure of angle HP and measure of angle PJ. But angle HP could be an inscribed angle or a central angle. Given that H and P are points on the circle, and M is the center. Let me think. 

First, let's clarify the notation. In circle problems, m∠ABC typically denotes the measure of the angle at point B, so angle ABC. But sometimes, especially with arcs, m∠arc AB refers to the measure of the arc AB. However, the problem uses "m ∠HP", which would usually denote an angle with vertex at H, but that's unclear. Alternatively, it might be an arc. But given the presence of the circle and the points, it's more likely that m∠HP refers to the measure of arc HP. However, the notation is non-standard. Alternatively, it might be the measure of the central angle subtended by arc HP. 

Assuming that m∠HP refers to the measure of arc HP, then we need to find the measure of arc PJ. 

But let's proceed carefully. Let me re-examine the given data. 

Given that HJ is a chord of length 48. Since H and J are endpoints of the chord HJ. Also, since HJ is a chord, and given that the circle has center M, then the distance from M to the chord HJ can be found using the formula for the distance from the center to a chord. 

Also, since HJ is a chord of length 48, then the radius r can be found. Wait, but earlier, FL is a chord of length 24, and since ML is a radius, which is perpendicular to FL. Therefore, FL is a chord with midpoint L, and ML is the perpendicular bisector. Therefore, triangle MFL is a right triangle with legs ML and half of FL. Since FL is 24, half of that is 12. Then, ML is a radius. Let me compute the radius. 

Let me write that down. 

For chord FL: length 24, midpoint L. So FL is divided into two equal parts of 12 each. Since ML is perpendicular to FL and connects to the center M, so triangle MFL is a right triangle with legs ML (radius) and 12, hypotenuse MF. Wait, no. Wait, FL is a chord. The distance from M to the chord FL is ML, which is the radius. Wait, no. Wait, ML is a radius because M is the center and L is a point on the circle. Wait, but L is the midpoint of FL. Wait, if L is the midpoint of FL, then FL is a chord, and ML is the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord. Therefore, ML is perpendicular to FL. 

Therefore, triangle MFL is a right triangle with legs ML (which is a radius) and FL/2 = 12. Wait, but FL is a chord, so the length from M to the chord is ML. Wait, actually, ML is the radius, but the distance from M to the chord FL is zero? No. Wait, if L is the midpoint of FL, then ML is the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord. Therefore, ML is perpendicular to FL, and hence, ML is the distance from the center to the chord. Wait, but since L is on the circle, then ML is the radius. Therefore, the distance from M to the chord FL is ML, which is equal to the radius. Wait, that can't be. Because the distance from the center to the chord is supposed to be less than or equal to the radius. Wait, but here, since L is on the circle, then the distance from M to the chord FL is ML, which is the radius. Wait, but that implies that the chord FL is tangent to the circle? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, there's confusion here. Let me clarify. 

Wait, FL is a chord of the circle. Its midpoint is L, which is a point on the circle. That seems impossible unless the chord is degenerate. Wait, hold on. If L is the midpoint of chord FL, then L must lie halfway along FL. But since L is a point on the circle, that would imply that FL is a diameter. Because if L is the midpoint of FL and also on the circle, then FL must be a diameter. Because the midpoint of a diameter is the center. Wait, but here, L is on the circle, so if FL is a diameter, then M would be the midpoint of FL. But according to the given data, IsMidpointOf says that L is the midpoint of FL. Wait, that would mean that M is the midpoint of FL? But M is the center of the circle. So that would imply that FL is a diameter. Therefore, FL is a diameter of the circle. Hence, FL = 2r. Given that FL is 24, then the radius r is 12. 

Ah, that makes sense. So FL is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, the radius is 12. 

Similarly, for the chord HJ, which has length 48. Since HJ is a chord of the circle with length 48, and since the radius is 12, this would suggest that HJ is another diameter. Because maximum possible chord length is the diameter, which is 2*radius=24. Wait, but HJ is given as 48. Wait, that's impossible because if the radius is 12, then diameter is 24. So there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, this indicates a mistake in my previous reasoning. Let me go back. 

Wait, FL is a chord with length 24, and L is the midpoint of FL. So FL is a chord whose midpoint is L. Therefore, FL is not necessarily a diameter. But if L is the midpoint of FL, then ML is perpendicular to FL. Since L is on the circle, then ML is a radius. Therefore, triangle MFL is a right triangle with legs ML (radius) and FL/2 (since L is the midpoint). So, applying Pythagoras: (FL/2)^2 + (ML)^2 = (MF)^2. But MF is the radius, since F is on the circle. Wait, MF is a radius. Therefore, MF = ML. So substituting, (FL/2)^2 + (ML)^2 = ML^2 → (FL/2)^2 = 0 → FL = 0. Which is impossible. This contradiction suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Where did I go wrong? Oh! Wait, if L is the midpoint of FL, then FL is a chord with midpoint L. But since L is on the circle, then FL is a chord whose midpoint is a point on the circle. That would mean that the distance from M to the chord FL is zero, implying that the chord passes through the center. Hence, FL is a diameter. Therefore, FL is a diameter. Thus, FL = 2r, so 2r = 24 → r = 12. 

But then, for chord HJ with length 48, which would require that the diameter is 48, which contradicts r = 12. So this is a problem. There must be a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the predicates. 

Looking back: 

- Line(F,L): This is a line segment FL. 
- IsMidpointOf(Point(L), Line(F,L)): So L is the midpoint of FL. 
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(L), Circle(M)): So L is on the circle. 
- IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)): So ML is a radius. 

Thus, ML is a radius, and L is the midpoint of FL. Therefore, FL is a chord with midpoint L on the circle. So the distance from M to the chord FL is ML, which is the radius. But how can that be? Because the distance from the center to the chord is the length of the perpendicular from the center to the chord. Here, ML is the radius, and since L is the midpoint of FL, ML is perpendicular to FL. Therefore, ML is the distance from the center to the chord FL. But since ML is a radius, that implies that the distance from M to FL is equal to the radius. But the distance from the center to the chord must be less than or equal to the radius. The only way this can happen is if the chord is tangent to the circle, but that would make the distance equal to the radius. But FL is a chord, not a tangent. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in interpreting the given predicates. Perhaps the line FL is not a chord but another structure? Wait, no. The predicate IsChordOf(Line(F,L), Circle(M)) states that FL is a chord of the circle. So FL is indeed a chord. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line FL is not a straight line? No, lines are straight. 

Wait, perhaps my understanding of the midpoint is incorrect. If L is the midpoint of FL, then FL is twice the length from F to L. But since L is on the circle, then FL is a chord starting at F (on the circle), going through L (also on the circle), making FL a diameter. Because if L is the midpoint of FL, then F and L are symmetric with respect to M. Wait, but if ML is a radius, then M is the center. If L is the midpoint of FL, then M must be the midpoint of FL as well? Because if L is the midpoint, then FM = ML. But ML is a radius, so FM is also a radius. Therefore, FL = FM + ML = 2r. Hence, FL is a diameter. Therefore, FL = 2r = 24 ⇒ r = 12. 

Then, for the chord HJ with length 48. But the maximum possible chord length is the diameter, which is 24. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Wait, maybe HJ is not a straight line chord? But the predicate IsChordOf(Line(H,J), Circle(M)) says it is. So HJ is a chord. Unless the length given is not the length of the chord itself but something else? Wait, the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,L)), 24) gives the length of FL as 24. Similarly, Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), 48) gives the length of HJ as 48. But if the radius is 12, then the diameter is 24, so a chord longer than 24 is impossible. 

This inconsistency suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine the premises. 

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙M, FL = 24, HJ = 48..." So FL and HJ are lengths of chords. But if the circle has radius r, then the maximum chord length is 2r. So if FL is 24, then 2r ≥ 24 ⇒ r ≥ 12. But HJ is 48, which requires 2r ≥ 48 ⇒ r ≥ 24. Therefore, the radius must be at least 24. But earlier, from FL being a chord with midpoint L, we thought that FL is a diameter. Wait, but if FL is a diameter, then its length is 2r. But if HJ is a chord of length 48, then 2r must be ≥ 48, so r ≥ 24. 

So maybe FL is not a diameter. Let me re-analyze. 

Since L is the midpoint of FL, and ML is a radius. So, as before, ML is perpendicular to FL. Therefore, triangle MFL is a right triangle with legs ML (radius r) and FL/2 (half-length of chord FL), and hypotenuse MF (which is a radius). Wait, but MF is a radius, so MF = r. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

(FL/2)^2 + (ML)^2 = (MF)^2  
=> (FL/2)^2 + r^2 = r^2  
=> (FL/2)^2 = 0  
=> FL = 0  

Which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the interpretation of the predicates. Let me check the predicates again. 

Wait, the predicate IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)) says that ML is a radius. So ML is a radius. But if L is the midpoint of FL, then FL is a chord with midpoint L. But if ML is perpendicular to FL, then ML is the distance from the center to the chord FL. But since L is on the circle, that would mean that ML is equal to the radius. But the distance from the center to the chord is equal to the radius, which would mean that the chord is tangent to the circle. But FL is a chord, not a tangent. Hence, this is impossible. 

Wait, unless L is the midpoint of FL, but FL is not a straight line? No, FL is a line segment. 

This contradiction implies that either the problem has inconsistent data or there's a misinterpretation. Let me consider alternative interpretations. 

Perhaps the line FL is not a chord, but another type of line? No, the predicate IsChordOf(Line(F,L), Circle(M)) explicitly states it is a chord. 

Wait, perhaps the midpoint of FL is not L? No, the predicate IsMidpointOf(Point(L), Line(F,L)) says that L is the midpoint of FL. 

Hmm. This seems like a paradox. Let me try to visualize. Suppose we have a circle with center M. Point F is on the circle. Line FL is a chord, with midpoint at L, which is also on the circle. So FL is a chord where the midpoint is another point on the circle. How is that possible? 

Imagine a circle. Take a chord FL. The midpoint of this chord is L, which is on the circle. That means that L is both the midpoint of FL and on the circle. So, FL is a chord where the midpoint is a point on the circle. This would imply that the chord FL is such that its midpoint lies on the circle. Let's calculate the length of such a chord. 

Let me denote the radius as r. Let’s assume the center is M. Let’s take a chord FL with midpoint L on the circle. So, the distance from M to the chord FL is ML. But since L is on the circle, ML is equal to r. But the distance from the center to the chord is ML. However, for a chord of length c, the relationship between the distance d from the center to the chord and the radius r is:

c = 2√(r² - d²)

Here, d = ML = r. Substituting:

c = 2√(r² - r²) = 0. So c = 0, which implies FL has zero length. Contradiction. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent. But since this is a math problem, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry or some other configuration? Or maybe there's a different interpretation of the predicates. 

Wait, maybe the line FL is not a straight line? No, lines are straight. 

Alternatively, maybe the midpoint is not in the middle of the line segment FL? But the predicate says IsMidpointOf(Point(L), Line(F,L)), which should mean L is the midpoint of FL. 

Another possibility: perhaps the line FL is not a chord, but a secant line passing through the circle, with L being a midpoint of the segment inside the circle? But the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(F,L), Circle(M)), so FL must be entirely within the circle as a chord. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look at other parts of the problem. 

We also have that HJ is a chord of length 48. Assuming the radius is larger than 24, say r > 24. Then, for the chord HJ of length 48, we can compute the angle subtended at the center. 

But without knowing the radius, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but earlier, from FL being a chord with midpoint L on the circle, we get contradictions unless... unless FL is not a chord but a diameter? Let me try assuming FL is a diameter. Then, FL = 2r = 24 ⇒ r = 12. But then HJ is a chord of length 48, which is impossible. 

Unless HJ is not a chord of the circle? But the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(H,J), Circle(M)). 

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and the length of HJ is 24 instead of 48? Or maybe FL is 48 and HJ is 24? That would make sense. But given the problem as stated, I need to work with what's given. 

Alternatively, maybe the chord HJ is not directly connected to the circle's radius? Let me think differently. 

Let me consider that FL is a chord with midpoint L on the circle. As previously, this leads to a contradiction unless the chord is zero length. But maybe the problem is in 3D space? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line FL is not a straight line? No, lines are straight. 

Wait, maybe the midpoint L is not on the circle? But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(Point(L), Circle(M)). 

I'm really confused. Maybe I need to move forward with the given data, even if there's a contradiction. 

Assume that FL is a diameter, so FL = 24, radius r = 12. Then, for chord HJ of length 48, which is impossible. But maybe the length is not the chord length but something else? Wait, the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), 48) says the length of line HJ is 48. If H and J are points on the circle, then the maximum possible length of HJ is the diameter, which is 24. So this is impossible. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement or my understanding. 

Wait, let me check the predicates again. Are there any other points? Points G, K, etc., but they are not mentioned in the question. 

Wait, perhaps the chord HJ is not a straight line? No, it's a line. 

Alternatively, maybe the line HJ is not a chord but a secant line passing through the circle, with H and J outside the circle? But the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(H,J), Circle(M)), which means it's a chord. 

At this point, I think there's a mistake in the problem, but since I need to proceed, I'll try to ignore the contradiction and proceed with the assumption that FL is a diameter (r = 12) and HJ is a chord of length 48, which would imply that the circle has a larger radius. Wait, but if FL is a diameter, then r = 12. If HJ is a chord of length 48, then this would require r ≥ 24. So, this is impossible. 

Maybe there's a misread in the problem. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙M, FL = 24, HJ = 48..." Maybe FL and HJ are not chords but diameters? If FL is a diameter, then FL = 2r = 24 → r = 12. If HJ is also a diameter, then HJ = 2r = 24, but the problem says HJ = 48. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe FL is a radius? But FL is a line segment from F to L, with L being the midpoint. So FL would be twice the radius? No. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on the part about the angle. The problem mentions m∠HP = 65 and asks for m∠PJ. Assuming that these are arc measures, and given that H and J are points on the circle, and P is also on the circle. 

If we can find the measure of arc HP and relate it to arc PJ, perhaps through central angles or inscribed angles. 

Assuming that m∠HP refers to the arc HP, and we need to find arc PJ. 

But without resolving the earlier contradiction, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of HJ is not 48 but 24? If that were the case, then HJ would be a diameter (length 24), and FL would also be a diameter (length 24). Then, the radius would be 12. 

But the problem states HJ = 48. So this is confusing. 

Perhaps the problem involves two circles? But the problem states "In ⊙M", so it's a single circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of HJ is not the straight-line distance but something else? No, LengthOf(Line(H,J)) should be the straight-line distance. 

At this point, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that there's a mistake in the problem, but given that it's a standardized test question, I'll try to proceed by assuming that the radius is 24, making FL = 24 as a diameter (so r = 12) and HJ = 48 as a chord. Wait, no. If r = 24, then diameter is 48. So if HJ is a diameter, it would be 48. Then, FL could be a chord of length 24, which is possible. 

Wait, this makes sense! Let me try this. 

Assume that the radius is 24. Then, diameter is 48. So if HJ is a diameter, its length is 48. Then, FL is a chord of length 24. 

Now, for FL, since it's a chord of length 24, and L is the midpoint of FL. So, using the formula for the distance from the center to the chord: 

For a chord of length c, the distance d from the center is d = √(r² - (c/2)^2). 

But here, the distance from the center to the chord FL is ML. Wait, but L is the midpoint of FL and lies on the circle. So, ML is the distance from the center to the chord FL. But since L is on the circle, this distance is equal to the radius? No, the distance from the center to the chord is d. If L is the midpoint of FL, then ML is the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord. But if L is on the circle, then ML is equal to the radius. So, combining with the chord length formula:

d = √(r² - (c/2)^2)  
But here, d = ML = r, since L is on the circle. So:

r = √(r² - (c/2)^2)  
Square both sides:  
r² = r² - (c/2)^2  
→ 0 = -(c/2)^2  
→ c = 0. 

Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that even with r = 24, the same issue persists. 

I think I need to abandon this approach and consider that maybe the midpoint L is not on the circle, but the predicate says it is. 

Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(Point(L), Circle(M)). So L is on the circle. 

Given all this, I think there's a fundamental flaw in the problem's setup. However, since this is a problem to solve, I'll proceed under the assumption that the length of FL is 24, and HJ is 48, with the circle having radius r, and try to find relations between the arcs. 

Assuming that FL is a chord of length 24, and HJ is a chord of length 48. Let me calculate the central angles corresponding to these chords. 

For a chord of length c, the central angle θ satisfies c = 2r sin(θ/2). 

So for FL: 24 = 2r sin(θ₁/2) → sin(θ₁/2) = 12/r. 

For HJ: 48 = 2r sin(θ₂/2) → sin(θ₂/2) = 24/r. 

But since the maximum value of sin is 1, 24/r ≤ 1 → r ≥ 24. 

So r ≥ 24. 

Now, the problem mentions that m∠HP = 65. Assuming this is the measure of arc HP, then the central angle for arc HP is 65 degrees. 

If we can relate arc HP to arc PJ, we can find the desired measure. 

But how? 

Looking at the points: H, P, J are on the circle. From the predicates, we have lines HP and PJ. Also, line HJ is a chord. So H-P-J are collinear, making HJ a straight line through P. 

So, HJ is a straight line passing through P, with H and J on the circle. So P is a point on the circle such that H-P-J is a straight line, making HJ a chord passing through P. 

Now, if HJ is a chord of length 48, and P is a point on it, then HP and PJ are segments of the chord HJ. 

Given that, the measure of arc HP plus the measure of arc PJ equals the measure of arc HJ. 

If the measure of arc HP is 65°, then the measure of arc PJ would depend on whether P is between H and J or not. But since P is on the chord HJ, and assuming it's between H and J, then arc HP + arc PJ = arc HJ. 

However, the measure of arc HJ is determined by the central angle corresponding to chord HJ, which we calculated earlier. 

But we don't know the central angle for HJ. However, we do know the length of HJ is 48, and the radius r ≥ 24. 

But without knowing r, we can't find the exact measure. However, perhaps there's a relation between the arcs via other information. 

Additionally, we have the right angles at M: RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F)) and RightAngle(Angle(M,N,P)). 

From earlier, we assumed that FL is a diameter, but that led to contradictions. However, if we proceed with the idea that FL is a diameter (even though it caused contradictions), then the central angle for FL is 180°, making arc FL 180°. 

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since ML is a radius and is perpendicular to FL, and L is the midpoint of FL, then FL is a diameter. So, despite the earlier contradiction, let's assume that FL is a diameter. Hence, FL = 2r = 24 → r = 12. 

Then, for HJ, which is a chord of length 48, this would require r ≥ 24, which conflicts. But if we proceed, let's say r = 24. Then, HJ is a diameter, length 48. So, arc HJ is 180°. 

Now, if P is a point on the diameter HJ, then the measure of arc HP depends on where P is. If m∠HP = 65°, then arc HP is 65°, and arc PJ would be arc HJ - arc HP = 180° - 65° = 115°. But none of the answer choices match this. 

Alternatively, if m∠HP refers to an inscribed angle, then the arc would be double that. For example, if ∠HP is an inscribed angle subtending arc PJ, then the measure of the arc would be 2*65° = 130°. But this is just speculation. 

Given the answer choices include 130, which is option D. 

Alternatively, if m∠HP is the central angle, then arc HP is 65°, and arc PJ is 180° - 65° = 115°, which is not an option. 

But if m∠HP is an inscribed angle, then arc HP would be 130°, and if P is on HJ, then arc PJ would be 130°, but this depends on the position of P. 

Alternatively, if P is such that arc HP is 65°, then arc PJ would be 180° - 65° = 115°, but again, not matching. 

But if the problem involves other arcs, like involving the diameter FL, and the right angles at M, perhaps there's a way to relate the arcs. 

For example, if ML is perpendicular to FL, and MN is perpendicular to PJ, then those are radii perpendicular to the respective chords. 

If HJ is a diameter (length 48), then its central angle is 180°. If P is a point on HJ such that arc HP is 65°, then arc PJ would be 180° - 65° = 115°, but again, not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if the angle at P is 65°, and it's an inscribed angle subtending arc HJ, then the measure of arc HJ would be 2*65° = 130°, making arc HJ 130°, and since HJ is a diameter, this would imply the circle's circumference corresponds to 130°, which is not possible. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll guess that the answer is D. 130°, as it's one of the options and fits with doubling the angle if it's an inscribed angle.
