MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle ABC, and some predicates about angles and measures. The goal is to find the value of x, which seems to be related to the angles in the triangle. Let me break down what's given.

First, the Triangle(A,B,C) predicate tells us that points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there are Line predicates for AB, BC, and AC, which just confirm that those are sides of the triangle. The Angle predicates mention three angles: Angle(C,A,B), Angle(B,C,A), and Angle(A,B,C). Wait, I need to recall how angle notation works. In Angle(X,Y,Z), Y is the vertex, so the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So:

- Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, no—wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C,A,B) would be the angle at point A formed by points C, A, B. So that's angle CAB? Or maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. For example, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. So:

- Angle(A,B,C): vertex at B, with segments BA and BC.
- Angle(B,C,A): vertex at C, with segments CB and CA.
- Angle(C,A,B): vertex at A, with segments AC and AB.

So the three angles of triangle ABC are:

- At vertex A: Angle(C,A,B)
- At vertex B: Angle(A,B,C)
- At vertex C: Angle(B,C,A)

Wait, but the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(C,A,B)), so that means the angle at vertex A is a right angle. Because Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at A. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at A. 

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 90) confirms that this right angle measures 90 degrees. So angle at A is 90°, making it a right-angled triangle at A.

Now, the other two angles are given in terms of x. The measure of Angle(B,C,A) is x, which is the angle at vertex C. And the measure of Angle(A,B,C) is 2x, which is the angle at vertex B. Wait, because Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B. So the three angles of the triangle are:

- At A: 90°
- At B: 2x
- At C: x

But wait, in a triangle, the sum of angles is always 180 degrees. So adding them up: 90 + 2x + x = 180. That simplifies to 90 + 3x = 180. Subtracting 90 from both sides gives 3x = 90, so x = 30. But wait, let me check if that aligns with the SumOf predicate mentioned. The last predicate says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), 180). Which translates to the sum of the three angles being 180, which is standard for triangles. So substituting the values:

MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 90
MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) = x
MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 2x
Total sum: 90 + x + 2x = 180 → 3x = 90 → x=30. So according to this, x is 30. Looking at the options, C is 30. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem mentions that the measure of Angle(B,C,A) is x, which is the angle at C. The measure of Angle(A,B,C) is 2x, which is the angle at B. Since the triangle is right-angled at A, the other two angles must add up to 90 degrees. So x + 2x = 90 → 3x=90 → x=30. Yes, same conclusion. So the answer is C. Let me check the answer choices again. Choices are A.10, B.20, C.30, D.40. So C is correct. Hence, Final Answer: C.
