Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question says that the measure of angle 2 is twice x, and the measure of angle 3 is x. We need to find the measure of angle 2. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. 

First, I need to parse the given predicates. Let me list them again:

- Circle(G)
- Points A, B, C, F, H, J, G (wait, G is mentioned as a point and a circle? Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again. Oh, the first line says "Circle(G)" so G is the name of the circle. Then Point(G) would be a point named G? Wait, no, looking at the given predicates:

Wait, the user wrote:

IsRadiusOf(Line(G,J), Circle(G))"

Oh, okay, so there's a circle named G. Then points A, B, C, F, H, J, and also a point G? Wait, the Point(G) is listed. So point G is part of the diagram. Also, Line(G,A) and Line(G,J) are radii of the circle G. Because IsRadiusOf(Line(G,A), Circle(G)) and similarly for Line(G,J). So, point G is the center of the circle because those lines are radii.

So, the circle has center G. Lines BF and BH are diameters of the circle. Therefore, points B, F and B, H are endpoints of diameters. Since BF and BH are diameters, they pass through the center G. Wait, but if BF is a diameter, then its midpoint is G. Similarly for BH. But since both BF and BH are diameters starting from point B, that suggests that point B is one endpoint of two different diameters. Wait, but in a circle, each diameter passes through the center. So if BF and BH are diameters, then the center G must lie on both BF and BH. Therefore, point G is the intersection of BF and BH. But wait, BF and BH are both diameters, so they intersect at the center. Therefore, point B is a common endpoint of two diameters, meaning that B is on the circle, and G is the center. Wait, but if BF is a diameter, then B and F are endpoints. So the center G is the midpoint of BF and BH. So, points F and H are on the circle, and G is the center.

Also, lines GA and GJ are radii. So points A and J are on the circle, since GA and GJ are radii. So points A, J, F, H are all on the circle centered at G. 

Now, we have angles 2 and 3. The measures are given as angle 2 equals 2x and angle 3 equals x. The question is to find mâˆ 2. 

But where are these angles located? The problem mentions Angle(2) and Angle(3). Without more details, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps they refer to angles formed by the lines in the diagram. For example, angles involving points A, B, F, H, J, etc. 

Let me think about the possible configurations. Since BF and BH are diameters, and GA and GJ are radii. Maybe angles 2 and 3 are inscribed angles or central angles related to arcs of the circle. 

Alternatively, considering that angles could be formed by intersecting lines. For instance, if lines BF and BH are diameters, then they form angles at point B. Wait, but point B is on the circle, and BF and BH are diameters. So from point B, lines go to F and H, which are opposite ends. But since BF and BH are diameters, then the angle between BF and BH at point B would be... Well, since BF and BH are diameters, they are straight lines passing through the center. So the angle between BF and BH at point B would depend on how the diameters are arranged. However, since both BF and BH are diameters emanating from point B, that would mean that points F and H are on opposite sides of the circle relative to B. Wait, but in a circle, a diameter connects two points directly opposite each other. So if BF is a diameter, then F is the antipodal point of B. Similarly, BH being another diameter implies that H is the antipodal point of B. But that would imply that F and H are the same point, which isn't possible unless the circle is degenerate. That seems contradictory. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps my understanding is wrong here. 

Wait, if BF is a diameter, then the center G is the midpoint of BF. Similarly, BH is a diameter, so G is the midpoint of BH. Therefore, points F and H are both such that G lies on BF and BH. Thus, point B is connected to F and H via diameters, so BF and BH are two different diameters starting from point B. Which would mean that point B is the same as the center? No, because the center is G. Wait, if BF is a diameter, then the center G is the midpoint of BF. So point B is one end of the diameter, and F is the other. Similarly, BH is a diameter, so G is the midpoint of BH, meaning point B is one end of that diameter, and H is the other. Therefore, points F and H are two distinct points on the circle, each being the antipodal point of B. But that would mean that F and H are the same point, which is impossible unless the circle is a single point, which it's not. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my interpretation. 

Ah! Wait, perhaps BF and BH are diameters, but point B is not on the circle? Wait, but if BF is a diameter, then B must be on the circle because the diameter is a line segment connecting two points on the circle. Wait, no, the definition of a diameter is a line segment whose endpoints are on the circle and passes through the center. Therefore, if BF is a diameter, then both B and F are on the circle, and G is the center. So, point B is on the circle, and F is the antipodal point. Similarly, BH is a diameter, so B and H are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, H is the antipodal point of B along the other direction. So points F and H are two different points on the circle, each diametrically opposite to B. But that would imply that F and H are the same as each other, which is impossible unless the circle is degenerate. Hence, this seems contradictory. 

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps BF and BH are not both diameters starting from B. Wait, the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(B,F), Circle(G)). So Line(B,F) is a diameter of the circle. So that means the entire line BF is a diameter, which requires that B and F are endpoints of the diameter. Similarly for BH. Therefore, B is one endpoint of diameter BF, and F is the other. Similarly, B is one endpoint of diameter BH, and H is the other. Therefore, both F and H are antipodal points of B. Which would make F and H the same point, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup or my understanding is incorrect. 

Wait, maybe the line BF is a diameter, but point B is not necessarily on the circle? Wait, no. The definition of a diameter is a line segment connecting two points on the circle passing through the center. So the endpoints must be on the circle. So if BF is a diameter, then both B and F are on the circle. Similarly for BH. Therefore, B is a point on the circle, and F and H are points on the circle such that BF and BH are diameters. This would require that F and H are both antipodal to B, implying they are the same point, which is impossible. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. 

Wait, unless there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the line BF is considered as a diameter, but point B is not on the circle? But that contradicts the definition of a diameter. Alternatively, perhaps the line BF is a diameter, but the line extends beyond the circle. Wait, but the term diameter refers to the line segment, not the infinite line. Hmm. 

This confusion suggests that maybe there's an error in the problem statement. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that maybe points B and F are endpoints of a diameter, and points B and H are endpoints of another diameter, but in different directions. Wait, but that would require that point B is the same for both diameters. So if BF and BH are both diameters, then F and H are antipodal points of B, which would mean they're the same point. 

This seems like a paradox. Unless there's another way to interpret the predicates. Maybe the line BF is a diameter, but the line BH is not a diameter? Wait, no, the given predicate says both Line(B,F) and Line(B,H) are diameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line BF and BH are two different diameters, but not both starting from B. Wait, but the line BF starts at B and goes to F. So if BF is a diameter, then it must start at B and end at F, which is the antipodal point. Similarly for BH. Therefore, B is a common endpoint of two diameters, which would mean that F and H are both antipodal to B, making them the same point. 

This seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I need to reinterpret the predicates. Let me check again. 

Wait, the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(B,F), Circle(G)). So the line BF is a diameter. Therefore, B and F are endpoints of the diameter, hence both on the circle. Similarly for BH. Therefore, B is on the circle, and F and H are also on the circle. Therefore, the line BF is a diameter, and the line BH is another diameter. Therefore, both BF and BH are diameters of the circle, meaning that they are both passing through the center G. Therefore, the center G is the midpoint of both BF and BH. Therefore, points B, F, and H are colinear with G? Wait, no. If BF and BH are both diameters, then they are two different diameters. Each diameter passes through the center. Therefore, the two diameters BF and BH intersect at the center G. Therefore, the lines BF and BH are two different diameters intersecting at the center. Therefore, point B is one end of both diameters. Wait, that would mean that B is the same as the center? No, because the center is G. 

Wait, if BF is a diameter, then the midpoint of BF is G. Similarly, the midpoint of BH is G. Therefore, G is the midpoint of both BF and BH. Therefore, point B is one end of both diameters. So, for example, suppose the circle has center G. Then, the diameter BF has endpoints B and F, so G is the midpoint of BF. Similarly, diameter BH has endpoints B and H, so G is the midpoint of BH. Therefore, points F and H are both located on the circle such that they are diametrically opposite to B. Which would mean that F and H are the same point, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem setup. 

Unless there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the lines BF and BH are not diameters themselves, but parts of diameters? Wait, no, the predicate states that Line(B,F) is a diameter. Therefore, the entire line BF is a diameter. 

Hmm. This seems like a contradiction. But since the problem is given, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me try to visualize. Suppose we have a circle with center G. Point B is somewhere on the circumference. Then, line BF is a diameter, so F is the point opposite to B. Then, line BH is another diameter. How can that be? Unless H is another point on the circle such that BH is a diameter. But that would require that H is the antipodal point of B, just like F. So F and H are the same point. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight. Let me think differently. Maybe angles 2 and 3 are not related to the circle directly. Let me look back at the other predicates. There are points A and J, which are connected to G via radii. So GA and GJ are radii, meaning points A and J are on the circle. 

So, the diagram includes points A and J on the circle, connected to center G. Also, points B, F, H on the circle (since BF and BH are diameters). So, points B, F, H, A, J are all on the circle. 

Now, angles 2 and 3â€”maybe they are angles formed by some of these points. For example, maybe angle 2 is formed by lines BA and BJ, or something like that. 

Alternatively, since GA and GJ are radii, maybe triangle AGJ is an equilateral triangle or something. But without knowing specific positions, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since BF and BH are diameters, then angles subtended by these diameters might be right angles. For instance, any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. 

Wait, if we take a point on the circle and connect it to the endpoints of a diameter, the angle formed is a right angle. For example, if we have a diameter BF, and a point A on the circle, then angle BAF would be a right angle. But I need to relate this to the given angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angles 2 and 3 are central angles or inscribed angles related to arcs. 

Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. 

Also, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. 

Since angles 2 and 3 are related by mâˆ 2 = 2x and mâˆ 3 = x, maybe they are angles that add up to a certain value. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Let me try to think of possible scenarios. 

Suppose angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc, and angle 2 is a central angle subtending the same arc. Then, mâˆ 2 = 2*mâˆ 3. Which fits the given relationship: mâˆ 2 = 2x and mâˆ 3 = x. So if angle 3 is an inscribed angle and angle 2 is the corresponding central angle, then this relationship holds. 

In that case, if we can find the total measure of the arcs involved, we could find x. 

For example, suppose angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc of measure x*2, and angle 2 is the central angle subtending the same arc, which would be x*2. Wait, but according to the given, mâˆ 2=2x and mâˆ 3=x. So if angle 2 is the central angle, then its measure is equal to the arc measure. And angle 3 is an inscribed angle, so its measure is half the arc measure. Therefore, if they subtend the same arc, then mâˆ 2 = 2*mâˆ 3. Which matches the given equations. 

Thus, if angle 2 is a central angle and angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc, then we can set up the equation. 

However, we need to determine what arc they subtend. 

Looking back at the diagram, points A and J are on the circle, connected to the center G. Points B, F, and H are also on the circle. 

Perhaps angle 3 is formed by points A, B, and J, while angle 2 is formed by points B, G, and another point? Not sure. 

Alternatively, consider that since GA and GJ are radii, triangle AGJ is an isosceles triangle with GA=GJ. 

But without more info, it's still unclear. 

Wait, but the problem gives us that BF and BH are diameters. So, if we consider point B and draw diameters BF and BH, then points F and H are antipodal to B. So, for example, if we imagine point B on the circle, then F is directly opposite to B across the circle. Similarly, H is another diameter from B, which would mean that H is another point on the circle such that BH is a diameter. But this would require that H is the same as F, which again leads to a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the line BF is a diameter, and BH is a radius? No, because the predicate says BH is a diameter. 

Wait, unless there's a misread in the predicates. Let me recheck: 

IsDiameterOf(Line(B,F), Circle(G)) â†’ yes.

IsDiameterOf(Line(B,H), Circle(G)) â†’ yes.

So both BF and BH are diameters. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that points F and H are both diametrically opposite to B. Hence, F and H coincide. Which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the diagram may involve overlapping diameters or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line BF and BH are not both diameters, but rather, the line BF is a diameter, and BH is a radius? Wait, but the predicate says BH is a diameter. 

This is perplexing. Given that the problem comes with these predicates, perhaps there's a specific configuration intended. Let me try to proceed assuming that despite the apparent contradiction, there's a way to resolve it. 

Assume that points F and H are distinct. Therefore, even though both BF and BH are diameters, they must be in different directions. But how? If point B is fixed, then each diameter from B would go to a unique antipodal point. Therefore, F and H cannot be different. Hence, this suggests that the problem has conflicting information. However, since the problem exists, I must assume that there's a valid configuration. 

Maybe the lines BF and BH are not diameters in the traditional sense, but are diameters in terms of length? No, diameter refers to a specific line segment. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? Unlikely, as it's a standard plane geometry problem. 

Another thought: perhaps the line BF is a diameter, and the line BH is another diameter, but point B is not on the circle? Wait, but if BF is a diameter, then B must be on the circle. Otherwise, the diameter would not be defined. 

Wait, here's an alternative idea: maybe point B is the center of the circle? But the circle is named G, so the center is G. Therefore, point G is the center, and B is another point. 

Wait, if BF is a diameter, then the center G is the midpoint of BF. Similarly, BH is a diameter, so the center G is the midpoint of BH. Therefore, points F and H are such that G is the midpoint of BF and BH. Therefore, the coordinates of G would be the average of B and F, and also the average of B and H. Therefore, unless F and H are symmetric with respect to B, this is possible. 

For example, suppose we place coordinate system with G at origin (0,0). Letâ€™s say point B is at (a, b). Then, since G is the midpoint of BF, point F would be (-a, -b), because midpoint between B(a,b) and F(x,y) is ((a+x)/2, (b+y)/2) = (0,0). So x = -a, y = -b. So F is (-a,-b). Similarly, if BH is another diameter, then H is such that G is the midpoint of BH. So point H would be (-a, -b) as well? No, that would make F and H the same point. 

Alternatively, if BH is another diameter, then H would be located such that G is the midpoint between B and H. So if B is (a,b), then H would be (-a,-b). Wait, that's the same as F. So again, F and H would be the same point. 

This seems to suggest that the problem's setup is inconsistent. However, since the problem is presented, there must be a resolution. Perhaps there's an error in interpreting the predicates. Let me check once more. 

Wait, maybe the line BF is a diameter, and the line BH is not a diameter, but another line? No, the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(B,H), Circle(G)), so it must be a diameter. 

At this point, I'm stuck trying to reconcile the given predicates. Perhaps I should focus on the angles instead of the diameters. 

The problem gives that mâˆ 2 = 2x and mâˆ 3 = x. The question asks for mâˆ 2. The answer options are 30, 45, 60, 90. These are common angles, so likely the answer relates to a right triangle or something involving 30-60-90 or 45-45-90 triangles. 

Let me think: if angle 3 is x, and angle 2 is 2x, and they are complementary or supplementary, or part of a triangle. 

For example, if they are angles in a triangle, then their sum plus another angle equals 180. But without knowing the triangle, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if angles 2 and 3 are angles formed by intersecting chords or secants. 

Wait, another idea: since GA and GJ are radii, and if points A and J are on the circle, then triangle AGJ is an isosceles triangle with GA = GJ. If angle AJG or something is involved. 

Alternatively, since BF and BH are diameters, and GA and GJ are radii, maybe there are triangles involving these lines. 

Let me try to consider that angles 2 and 3 are inscribed angles and central angles. 

If angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc of measure x, then the central angle would be 2x. So if angle 2 is the central angle, then it would be 2x. Therefore, mâˆ 2 = 2x, which matches the given condition. 

Thus, if angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc, and angle 2 is the central angle subtending the same arc, then the relationship holds. 

Then, the total measure of the arc would be 2x (the central angle), and the inscribed angle would be x. 

Now, the question is, what is the total measure of the arc that these angles subtend? 

If the arc is part of the circle, then the sum of all arcs in a circle is 360 degrees. 

But without knowing the specific arc, it's hard to find x. However, perhaps the angles are related to the diameter. 

For example, if the arc is a semicircle (180 degrees), then the inscribed angle would be 90 degrees, and the central angle would be 180 degrees. But in this case, mâˆ 3 would be 90, and mâˆ 2 would be 180, which doesn't fit the given relation. 

Alternatively, if the arc is 120 degrees, then the central angle is 120, and the inscribed angle is 60. So if x=60, then mâˆ 2=120, mâˆ 3=60. But this doesn't match the given equations mâˆ 2=2x and mâˆ 3=x. Wait, if x=60, then mâˆ 2=120, mâˆ 3=60. Which fits 2x=120 and x=60. So that would make x=60, leading to mâˆ 2=120. But 120 is not among the answer choices. The choices are 30, 45, 60, 90. 

Alternatively, if the arc is 60 degrees, then the central angle is 60, and the inscribed angle is 30. So mâˆ 3=30, mâˆ 2=60. So x=30, mâˆ 2=60. Which would mean the answer is C. 60. 

But why would the arc be 60 degrees? Let me see. If the arc is 60 degrees, then the central angle is 60, and the inscribed angle is 30. 

But how does this relate to the given diagram? 

Perhaps the arc is related to the position of points A and J. For example, if points A and J are separated by an arc of 60 degrees, then the central angle between them is 60, and the inscribed angle would be 30. 

But how does this tie into the other elements of the diagram? 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving points B, A, and J. 

Let me try to imagine that angle 3 is âˆ ABJ, and angle 2 is âˆ AJB or something. 

Alternatively, since GA and GJ are radii, and if there's a triangle involving GA and GJ, maybe forming an equilateral triangle. 

But without a clear diagram, it's difficult. 

However, given the answer choices, and the fact that if x=30, then mâˆ 2=60 (which is option C), or if x=45, mâˆ 2=90 (option D), or x=60, mâˆ 2=120 (not an option), or x=90, mâˆ 2=180 (also not an option). 

So among the options, C and D are possible. 

But how to choose between them? 

Let me reconsider the earlier scenario where the arc is 60 degrees. If the inscribed angle is 30 (x=30), and the central angle is 60 (mâˆ 2=60). So x=30, mâˆ 2=60, which would make the answer C. 

Alternatively, if the arc is 90 degrees, then the inscribed angle is 45, and the central angle is 90. So x=45, mâˆ 2=90. Which would give answer D. 

Which one is correct? 

To decide, we need to find which arc is involved. 

Given that BF and BH are diameters, and GA and GJ are radii, perhaps the arc in question is related to the diameters. 

For example, if the arc between points F and H is 60 degrees, then the central angle would be 60, and the inscribed angle would be 30. But how does this relate to the diagram? 

Alternatively, if the arc between points A and B is related. 

Wait, if we consider that GA is a radius, and GB is another radius? No, GB is not mentioned. Wait, point B is on the circle, so GB is a radius. 

Because if G is the center, then GB is a radius. Wait, but the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(G,A), Circle(G)), so GA is a radius. So GB would also be a radius, since B is on the circle. 

Therefore, points A, B, F, H, J are all on the circle, with G as the center. 

Now, if we consider triangle ABF, since BF is a diameter, then angle at A would be a right angle. Because any triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. So if A is on the circle, and BF is a diameter, then âˆ BAF is 90 degrees. 

Similarly, if we consider angle at A subtended by BH, but not sure. 

But how does this relate to angles 2 and 3? 

Let me assume that angle 3 is 45 degrees (x=45), making angle 2=90 degrees. Or angle 3=30, angle 2=60. 

Let me think: if angle 2 is 90 degrees, then it could be a right angle, like the one in the semicircle. If angle 3 is 45 degrees, it could be an angle in an isosceles right triangle. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is 60 degrees, which could be part of an equilateral triangle. 

But without more specifics, it's hard. 

However, considering that the answer choices include 60 and 90, and given that in many geometric problems, especially those involving circles and diameters, right angles appear frequently. 

If angle 2 is 90 degrees, that would mean x=45. But how would that relate to the diagram? 

Alternatively, if angle 3 is x=30, then angle 2=60. This could happen if, for example, the arc subtending angle 3 is 60 degrees, making the central angle 60, and the inscribed angle 30. 

But how to confirm? 

Let me think about the total circle. If the arc subtended by angle 3 is 60 degrees, then the remaining arcs would add up to 300 degrees. But this doesn't directly help. 

Alternatively, if the arc is part of a regular polygon. For example, if the circle is divided into six equal parts (each 60 degrees), then the central angles would be 60 degrees. 

But without more information, it's still ambiguous. 

However, given the answer choices, and the fact that angle 2 is twice angle 3, and common angles, the most plausible answers are 60 and 90. 

If we assume that the angles are part of a triangle where the sum is 180, then:

If angle 2 + angle 3 + another angle = 180. 

For example, if angle 2 = 2x, angle 3 = x, and another angle is y. So 2x + x + y = 180. But without knowing y, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if the angles are vertical angles or something. 

Alternatively, consider that angles 2 and 3 are angles formed by intersecting chords. 

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

But if angles 2 and 3 are formed by intersecting chords, then their measures would be related to arcs. 

But without knowing which arcs, it's still unclear. 

Given the time I've spent without resolving the diagram's contradictions, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the arc is 60 degrees, leading to x=30 and mâˆ 2=60 (choice C), or arc is 90 degrees, leading to x=45 and mâˆ 2=90 (choice D). 

Between these, which is more likely? 

In many standardized tests, 60 degrees is a common angle. Also, if angle 2 is 60 degrees, then x=30, which is a common angle. 

Alternatively, if the arc is 90 degrees, then x=45, which is also common. 

But how to decide? 

Let me think about the given predicates again. There are points A and J connected to G via radii. So GA and GJ are radii. If points A and J are positioned such that angle AJG is x, and angle AGJ is 2x, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if triangle AGJ is isosceles with GA=GJ, and angle at G is 2x, and base angles are x. Wait, in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. So if angle at G is 2x, then the other two angles would be (180-2x)/2 = 90-x. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

If angle 3 is one of the base angles, then x = 90-x => 2x=90 => x=45. Then mâˆ 2 = 2x = 90. So this would lead to answer D. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is the vertex angle, then it's 2x, and the base angles are x each. So 2x + 2x = 180 => x=45. Wait, no: 2x (vertex) + 2*(x) = 180? No, in an isosceles triangle, the vertex angle is 2x, and the base angles are x each. So 2x + x + x = 180 => 4x=180 => x=45. Then mâˆ 2 = 2x = 90. Again, leading to answer D. 

This suggests that if the triangle AGJ has angles 90Â°, 45Â°, 45Â°, then x=45, mâˆ 2=90. 

But how does this triangle relate to the rest of the diagram? 

If GA and GJ are radii, then triangle AGJ is isosceles with GA=GJ. If the angle at G is 90Â°, then it's a right isosceles triangle, with legs GA and GJ, and hypotenuse AJ. In this case, the angles at A and J would be 45Â° each. 

So if angle 3 is one of those base angles, then x=45, and angle 2 is 90. 

But how does this fit with the other elements of the diagram? 

The problem mentions diameters BF and BH. If point B is on the circle, and GA and GJ are radii, perhaps there's a connection between these elements. For example, if point B is one of the vertices of the triangle AGJ, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, if the angle at G (which is 90Â°) is related to the diameters BF and BH. 

But this is getting too speculative. 

However, given the calculation above, if we assume that triangle AGJ is a right isosceles triangle, then mâˆ 2=90Â°, which is option D. 

But another scenario where the arc is 60Â°, leading to mâˆ 2=60Â°, which is option C. 

Which one is more plausible? 

Well, if the arc is 60Â°, then the central angle is 60Â°, and the inscribed angle is 30Â°, which would mean x=30, and mâˆ 2=60. 

But how to know which arc is being referred to? 

Perhaps the arc between points A and J? If GA and GJ are radii, then the arc AJ would be the arc between A and J. If that arc is 60Â°, then the central angle is 60Â°, and the inscribed angle would be 30Â°. 

But without knowing the position of A and J, it's hard to say. 

However, given the answer choices and common geometric problems, both 60 and 90 are possible. 

But let me think again about the initial contradiction regarding the diameters BF and BH. If I ignore that contradiction and proceed under the assumption that the arc is 60Â°, leading to mâˆ 2=60Â°, then the answer would be C. 

Alternatively, if the arc is 90Â°, then mâˆ 2=90Â°, answer D. 

But how to decide? 

Let me consider that if angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc that is part of the diameter. For example, if the arc is a quarter-circle (90Â°), then the inscribed angle would be 45Â°, and the central angle would be 90Â°, leading to x=45, mâˆ 2=90. 

Alternatively, if the arc is a third of the circle (120Â°), then the inscribed angle is 60Â°, and the central angle is 120Â°, leading to x=60, mâˆ 2=120, which is not an option. 

But 60Â° is an option, so maybe the arc is 60Â°, leading to x=30, mâˆ 2=60. 

But how do we know which arc is being referenced? 

Given that the problem involves multiple diameters and radii, perhaps the arc is related to the diameters. 

For example, if the arc between points F and H is 60Â°, then the central angle would be 60Â°, and the inscribed angle would be 30Â°. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still guesswork. 

Given that the answer choices are limited, and considering that in many cases, angles involving diameters often lead to right angles (90Â°), which is option D, but also 60Â° is possible. 

However, since the problem involves two angles, 2x and x, and the sum of these could be part of a larger angle, like 3x. 

If 3x is 90Â°, then x=30Â°, leading to mâˆ 2=60Â° (option C). 

Or if 3x is 180Â°, then x=60Â°, mâˆ 2=120Â°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if the angles are complementary: 2x + x = 90Â° â‡’ 3x=90 â‡’ x=30Â°, so mâˆ 2=60Â°. 

This would make sense. So if angles 2 and 3 are complementary, then x=30Â°, mâˆ 2=60Â°, which is option C. 

This seems plausible. 

Why would they be complementary? If they are adjacent angles forming a right angle, or part of a triangle where their sum is 90Â°. 

For example, if angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a right triangle, then their sum could be 90Â°. 

This would fit with x=30Â°, mâˆ 2=60Â°. 

Given that, the answer would be C. 

But how does this relate to the diagram? 

If angle 2 is one acute angle in a right triangle, and angle 3 is the other, then 2x + x = 90Â°, leading to x=30Â°. 

This seems like a viable scenario. 

Considering all possibilities, I think the most consistent answer is C. 60 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer is C.
