====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the value of x, given some predicates about a triangle. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the problem mentions Triangle(A,B,C). That means points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there are several Line predicates: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), and Line(A,C). These indicate that each pair of points forms a side of the triangle. Also, there are Angle predicates: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,A), and Angle(C,A,B). Wait, those angles are at different vertices. Let me recall that the measure of an angle in a triangle depends on the vertex where it's located. 

Next, we have Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). This tells me that sides AB and AC are congruent because they're both length 3, as per the LengthOf predicates. So triangle ABC has two sides equal: AB and AC. Therefore, this is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC = 3 units. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. But wait, which angles are these? Since AB and AC are equal, the base would be BC, so the base angles would be angles at B and C. Wait, but the angles mentioned here are Angle(B,C,A) and Angle(C,A,B). Let me parse those.

Wait, the Angle(B,C,A) is the angle at point B, between points C and A. Similarly, Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A, between points C and B. Wait, maybe I need to clarify how the angle notation works. Typically, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at point Y, formed by points X-Y-Z. So Angle(B,C,A) is the angle at point C, between points B and A. Wait, no—wait, if it's Angle(B,C,A), then the vertex is C, with segments CB and CA. So that's angle at C. Similarly, Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at A, between points C and B. And Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B, between points A and C.

But since AB equals AC, then the triangle is isosceles with AB=AC. So the legs are AB and AC, making BC the base. Therefore, the base angles would be angles at B and C. Wait, but according to the given Angle measures, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)), 2x) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 2x). Let me check again:

Angle(B,C,A): Vertex at C, between B and A. So that's angle at C. Angle(C,A,B): Vertex at A, between C and B. So that's angle at A. Wait, so in the triangle ABC, angles at C and A are both 2x? Wait, but if AB = AC, then the base angles should be at B and C. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Let me re-express the triangle. Points A, B, C. AB and AC are equal. So triangle ABC has AB = AC, meaning it's isosceles with apex at A. Therefore, the base is BC, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. Therefore, the base angles are at B and C. However, the given angles are Angle(B,C,A) which is angle at C, and Angle(C,A,B) which is angle at A. Wait, so angle at C is 2x, angle at A is 2x? Then the third angle, at B, would be the remaining one. But wait, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let me note the given equations.

The problem states that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))) equals 180. So substituting, that would be angle at C (2x) + angle at A (2x) + angle at B (?) equals 180. Wait, but if the triangle is isosceles with AB=AC, then angles opposite those sides would be equal. Wait, AB and AC are sides. The side opposite angle C is AB, and the side opposite angle B is AC. Wait, since AB = AC, then angles opposite them would be equal. The angle opposite AB is angle C, and the angle opposite AC is angle B. Therefore, angle C equals angle B. But according to the given, angle at C is 2x, and angle at A is 2x. Wait, that would imply that angle B equals angle C (since AB=AC), but angle at B would be something else?

Wait, hold on. Let me get this straight. Let me label the triangle properly. Let me think of triangle ABC with AB = AC. So vertex A is the apex, connected to B and C. So sides AB and AC are equal. Therefore, angles opposite these sides are equal. The side opposite angle A is BC. The side opposite angle B is AC. The side opposite angle C is AB. Since AB = AC, then angles opposite them (which are angles C and B respectively) are equal. Therefore, angle B equals angle C. 

But according to the given, Angle(B,C,A) is angle at C, which is angle BCA. And Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A, which is angle CAB. So angle at C is 2x, angle at A is 2x. Wait, but if angle at C equals angle at B, then angle B is also 2x. But then the three angles would be angle A (2x), angle B (2x), angle C (2x)? That would make total 6x = 180, so x=30. But let me check that.

Wait, but if AB = AC, then angles opposite those sides are equal. AB is opposite angle C, and AC is opposite angle B. Therefore, angle C equals angle B. But according to the given, angle at C (angle BCA) is 2x, and angle at A (angle CAB) is 2x. Then angle B would be equal to angle C, which is 2x. Then the sum would be 2x (angle A) + 2x (angle B) + 2x (angle C) = 6x = 180 → x=30. Which is option B. But let me verify this with the given data.

Wait, but the problem says Equals(SumOf(...), 180). So the sum of the three angles is 180. The three angles are angle at C (2x), angle at A (2x), and angle at B (unknown). Wait, earlier conclusion was that angle B equals angle C, which is 2x. But that would mean all three angles are 2x, leading to 6x=180. But if angle B is equal to angle C, then angle B is 2x, angle C is 2x, angle A is 2x. So yes, that gives 6x=180. Hence x=30. So answer B.

But wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Because the angle at A is given as 2x, but according to the triangle being isosceles with AB=AC, angle at A is the vertex angle, and angles at B and C are the base angles. Therefore, angles at B and C are equal. But according to the given, angle at C is 2x and angle at A is 2x. Wait, that would suggest angle at A is equal to angle at C, but angle at C is a base angle. So if angle at A is equal to angle at C, then angle at B would be different. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Hold on, let me re-examine the angles. Let me denote the angles as follows:

In triangle ABC,

- Angle at A: ∠BAC = angle at A
- Angle at B: ∠ABC = angle at B
- Angle at C: ∠ACB = angle at C

Given that AB = AC, so triangle ABC is isosceles with AB=AC. Therefore, the base is BC, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. Therefore, the base angles are angles at B and C. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ACB.

Now, looking at the given angle measures:

- MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)): This is ∠BCA, which is angle at C (∠ACB).
- MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)): This is ∠CAB, which is angle at A (∠BAC).

So according to the problem:

MeasureOf(∠BCA) = 2x → ∠C = 2x

MeasureOf(∠CAB) = 2x → ∠A = 2x

Since the triangle is isosceles with AB=AC, then ∠B = ∠C. Wait, but ∠C is 2x, so ∠B is also 2x. Then the sum of angles:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 2x + 2x + 2x = 6x = 180 ⇒ x=30. So that suggests x is 30, which is option B.

But wait, another way to check: if AB=AC, then ∠B = ∠C. Given that ∠C is 2x, then ∠B is also 2x. Then ∠A is 180 - 2*(2x) = 180 -4x. But according to the problem, ∠A is 2x. So:

180 - 4x = 2x ⇒ 180 = 6x ⇒ x=30. Yes, same result. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the answer is B. 30 degrees. So the correct answer is B.
