Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the height of a parallelogram given that its area is 2000 square units. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 40, C. 50, D. 60. 

First, I need to recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram. The area is base multiplied by height, right? So, Area = base × height. The problem mentions that the area is 2000, so if I can figure out either the base or the height, I can find the other. But here, they mention something about variables x and x+10. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking at the predicates, there's an Equals statement: Equals(BaseOf(Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)), x + 10) and Equals(HeightOf(Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)), x). Oh, wait! So the base is x + 10 and the height is x. Then the area would be base times height, which is (x + 10) * x = 2000. That gives us the equation x(x + 10) = 2000. 

So expanding that equation: x² + 10x = 2000. Then, bringing all terms to one side: x² + 10x - 2000 = 0. Now, solving this quadratic equation. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=10, c=-2000. 

Applying the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the numbers: discriminant is (10)^2 - 4*1*(-2000) = 100 + 8000 = 8100. Square root of 8100 is 90. So x = [-10 ± 90]/2. Since x represents a length, it must be positive. So we take the positive solution: (-10 + 90)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Therefore, x is 40. 

But wait, the question asks for the height. From the predicates, HeightOf is x, so the height is 40. Looking at the answer choices, B is 40. So the answer should be B. Let me double-check my steps. 

Yes, the area is base times height, which is (x+10)*x = 2000. Solving gives x=40. Hence, the height is 40. That seems correct. No mistakes in the algebra. The quadratic was solved properly. The answer is B.
