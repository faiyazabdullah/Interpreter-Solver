MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines mentioned here. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, there are points X, Y, Z, W, and V. Wait, V is mentioned in the Angle(X,Z,V) predicate. Then there are lines connecting these points: Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,X), so that forms a triangle XYZ. Also, Line(W,X), Line(X,Z), and Line(W,Z). That means point W is connected to X and Z, forming another triangle WXZ? Or maybe it's part of some other shape. 

Then there are angles given. Angle(Y,X,Z) measures 105 degrees, and Angle(W,X,Z) is 23 degrees. There's also Angle(X,Z,V) measuring 24 degrees. And the question asks for the measure of angle 1, which I assume is referring to one of these angles, but since angle 1 isn't directly mentioned, maybe it's another angle formed somewhere?

Wait, looking at the predicates again: the last one is Angle(1). Oh, right! So angle 1 is another angle whose measure we need to find. But how does it relate to the others?

Let me sketch this mentally. Points X, Y, Z form a triangle. Point W is connected to X and Z, so perhaps forming two triangles: XYZ and WXZ. Also, there's a point V connected to X and Z via the line XZ, and an angle at XZV. Hmm.

So, starting with triangle XYZ. The angle at X between Y and Z is 105 degrees. Wait, no—the Angle(Y,X,Z) is at vertex X, between Y and Z. Wait, angle YXZ would be at X, with segments XY and XZ. But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)) is 105°, so that's angle at X between Y and Z. Similarly, Angle(W,X,Z) is at X between W and Z, which is 23°. So those two angles are adjacent at point X, sharing the side XZ. Therefore, the sum of angles at X from Y and W would be 105 + 23 = 128°, but wait, that's if they are adjacent. However, since both angles share the same vertex X and side XZ, maybe they form a larger angle? Wait, but if Y and W are on different sides of XZ, then the total angle around X could be more than 180°, but that depends on the configuration.

But wait, in standard plane geometry, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but if these angles are parts of triangles, maybe they are part of a larger structure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a straight line involved. Wait, but I don't see any mention of a straight line except for the lines listed. Let me think again.

Looking at the lines: Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,X) make triangle XYZ. Then Line(W,X), Line(X,Z), Line(W,Z). So point W is connected to X and Z, making triangle WXZ. So, points W, X, Z form triangle WXZ. So angle at X between W and Z is 23°, which is given. Meanwhile, angle at X between Y and Z is 105°, so these two angles are adjacent at X, both involving the segment XZ. Therefore, the total angle around point X would be the sum of these two angles plus any other angles at X. But unless there's something else, like a straight line, but there's no indication of that. However, if we consider that points Y and W are on opposite sides of XZ, then the sum of the angles at X would be 105 + 23 = 128°, leaving 360 - 128 = 232° for other angles at X, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, if they are on the same side, but that would mean overlapping, which is impossible. Maybe there's a straight line through X? For example, if points Y and W are on opposite sides of XZ, creating a straight line? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle XYZ and triangle WXZ share the side XZ. Then, at point X, angles between Y and Z (105°) and between W and Z (23°). So those two angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle. Wait, but in triangle XYZ, the angle at X is 105°, and in triangle WXZ, the angle at X is 23°. So if you imagine standing at point X, looking along XZ towards Z, then turning towards Y gives 105°, and turning towards W gives 23°. Depending on where W is relative to Y, these angles could add up or subtract. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, maybe there's another angle involved here.

Also, there's Angle(X,Z,V) measuring 24°, which is the angle at Z between X and V. So point V is connected to Z and X, forming another triangle or line? Since there's a line XZ already, and V is connected to Z and X. So point V is such that angle at Z between X and V is 24°, so that's angle XZV.

Now, the question is about angle 1, which is just called Angle(1). It's not specified which angle it refers to, but since all other angles are named with letters (like Y,X,Z, etc.), angle 1 is probably a separate angle that we need to calculate. Given the answer choices are numerical, likely angle 1 is an angle formed by some intersection or constructed from existing elements.

Let me think about possible configurations. Let's consider triangle XYZ with angle at X being 105°, and triangle WXZ with angle at X being 23°. These two triangles share side XZ. Now, if we look at point Z, which has angle XZV of 24°, so that's angle at Z between X and V. So perhaps V is a new point connected to Z and X, forming another triangle or line.

Perhaps there's a triangle involving V? For instance, if we connect V to another point? Or maybe there's a transversal or something. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an external angle or part of some triangle.

Another thought: since there are multiple angles given, maybe applying the concept of exterior angles or supplementary angles. For example, if we consider the sum of angles in a triangle, or in a polygon.

Wait, let's check the angles at point X. In triangle XYZ, angle at X is 105°, and in triangle WXZ, angle at X is 23°. If these two angles are adjacent, then the total angle around point X would be 105 + 23 = 128°, but in reality, the full angle around a point is 360°, so the remaining angles would be 360 - 128 = 232°, which doesn't seem helpful. Unless there's a straight line through X. Suppose that points Y and W lie on opposite sides of XZ, forming a straight line through X. Wait, but that would require that the angles at X add up to 180°, but 105 + 23 = 128 < 180, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving V. Since angle at Z between X and V is 24°, so angle XZV = 24°, which suggests that in triangle XZV, angle at Z is 24°, and perhaps other angles can be found.

Wait, but what's the relationship between these triangles? Are there any intersecting lines or common sides?

Let me try to visualize:

- Triangle XYZ with angle at X = 105°, so the other angles at Y and Z can be calculated if needed.

- Triangle WXZ with angle at X = 23°, so angles at W and Z can be determined if needed.

Additionally, there's a point V such that angle at Z between X and V is 24°, so perhaps V is connected to Z and X, forming triangle XZV.

But how do these relate to each other? Maybe there's a way to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles? Or maybe considering the sum of angles in certain polygons.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is the third angle in some triangle, or an external angle.

Wait, the given answer choices are 37.5, 47, 52.5, 133. Let me note that 105 + 23 = 128, and 180 - 128 = 52. But 52 is close to option C (52.5). Alternatively, maybe there's some relation between the angles given and angle 1.

Wait, let's think about triangle WXZ. We know angle at X is 23°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe we can find relations. Similarly for triangle XYZ.

In triangle XYZ, angle at X is 105°, so the sum of angles at Y and Z is 75°. Similarly, in triangle WXZ, angle at X is 23°, so angles at W and Z sum to 157°. But without more info, that might not help directly.

But there's also angle XZV = 24°, which is angle at Z between X and V. So in triangle XZV, angle at Z is 24°, and if we can find other angles there, maybe we can link them.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 is an exterior angle to one of these triangles. For example, if angle 1 is outside triangle XYZ or WXZ.

Wait, but how can we determine which angle is referred to as angle 1? Since the problem mentions Angle(1) as a predicate, maybe angle 1 is an angle formed by some intersection, perhaps between lines from different triangles.

Another idea: maybe considering the sum of angles around point Z. At point Z, we have several angles:

From triangle XYZ: angle at Z, which we don't know yet.

From triangle WXZ: angle at Z, which we don't know yet.

And angle XZV is 24°, which is another angle at Z between X and V.

So, if we can compute the angles at Z from the triangles, then adding them with 24°, maybe we can find relations.

But first, let's attempt to find angles in triangles XYZ and WXZ.

Starting with triangle XYZ. Let's denote angle at X as ∠YXZ = 105°, angles at Y and Z as ∠XYZ and ∠XZY. Their sum is 180 - 105 = 75°. But without more info, we can't determine individual angles.

Similarly, triangle WXZ has angle at X = 23°, so angles at W and Z sum to 157°. Again, not enough.

However, if we can relate angles at Z from both triangles, maybe through the angle XZV.

Assuming that point V lies somewhere such that angle XZV is 24°, maybe forming a triangle with Z, X, and V. If we can find the angles in that triangle, perhaps we can relate them.

But without knowing the type of triangle XZV, it's difficult. However, if we suppose that V lies on a particular line, maybe extending some existing lines.

Wait, perhaps V is on the extension of some line? For example, if angle XZV is 24°, maybe V is such that ZV is a continuation of some line. Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving V and other points.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is the angle at point Z between W and V, or some other combination.

Alternatively, since there are multiple angles at point Z, maybe angle 1 is the difference between some angles.

Wait, here's a thought: Let's consider the angles at point Z. From triangle XYZ, angle at Z is ∠XZY. From triangle WXZ, angle at Z is ∠WZX. Additionally, angle XZV is 24°, which is angle between XZ and ZV. So, depending on where V is located, these angles might be adjacent or supplementary.

Suppose that ZV is a line extending from Z, forming angle 24° with XZ. So, if we imagine at point Z, there are three lines: ZX, ZY (from triangle XYZ), ZW (from triangle WXZ), and ZV (forming 24° with XZ). But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, if we can express the angles at Z in terms of these triangles and angle XZV, maybe we can find relations.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is the supplement of some angle, or the sum/difference of given angles.

Wait, another approach: the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and perhaps considering the angles around point Z.

Let me try to assign variables. Let’s denote:

In triangle XYZ:

∠YXZ = 105°, ∠XYZ = α, ∠XZY = β → α + β = 75°.

In triangle WXZ:

∠WXZ = 23°, ∠WXZ is the angle at X, so the other angles are ∠XZW = γ and ∠XWZ = δ → γ + δ = 157°.

At point Z, we have angles from triangles XYZ (∠XZY = β), triangle WXZ (∠XZW = γ), and angle XZV = 24°. Assuming that these angles are adjacent or supplementary.

But if ZV forms a line such that angle between XZ and ZV is 24°, then depending on direction, this could be part of the angles at Z.

For example, suppose that ZV is inside the angle formed by ZY and ZW. Or maybe it's extending one of those lines.

Alternatively, maybe ZV is forming a straight line with some other line. This is getting too vague without a diagram.

Wait, let's think differently. What if angle 1 is the angle between lines WV and something else? Or maybe between lines YV and ZV? Not sure.

Alternatively, since there's angle XZV = 24°, which is part of triangle XZV. If we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe we can find relations.

But without more information about triangle XZV, like side lengths or other angles, it's tricky. However, if we assume that triangle XZV shares a side with another triangle, maybe?

Wait, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? Or some other property.

Alternatively, think about the sum of all angles around point Z. Let's say that at point Z, there are several angles: from triangle XYZ (β), from triangle WXZ (γ), and angle XZV (24°). If these angles are adjacent, their sum might be 180° or 360°, depending on their arrangement.

For example, if ZV is forming a straight line with another line, then maybe 24° plus some other angle equals 180°.

But this is speculative. Let me try to find another way.

Given that the answer options include numbers like 37.5, which is half of 75, and 52.5 is 75 - 22.5, or 105 - 52.5 = 52.5. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle to one of the triangles. For example, in triangle XYZ, the exterior angle at X would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But we already have the angle at X as 105°, which is an interior angle.

Wait, but if we consider the angle between W and Y at X? No, because W and Y are on different sides of XZ.

Alternatively, think about the total angle around point X. As earlier, if there are two angles at X: 105° and 23°, totaling 128°, then the remaining angle around point X is 360 - 128 = 232°, but that seems large. However, if there's another line passing through X, forming another angle. But without more info, this might not help.

Wait, here's an alternative idea: Perhaps angle 1 is the angle between lines WZ and YZ, or some other combination. Let me think about the possibility that angle 1 is the vertical angle or some other angle formed by intersecting lines.

Alternatively, since there's angle XZV = 24°, and angle at X between W and Z is 23°, and angle at X between Y and Z is 105°, maybe there's a relationship between these angles and angle 1.

Wait, what if angle 1 is the angle between lines WZ and YZ? To find that, we'd need to consider the angles at Z. Let me explore that.

If we consider lines WZ and YZ meeting at Z. The angle between them would depend on the angles from triangles WXZ and XYZ. In triangle WXZ, angle at Z is γ (which we don't know), and in triangle XYZ, angle at Z is β (also unknown). If these angles are adjacent, then the angle between WZ and YZ would be γ + β, or |γ - β|, depending on their orientation.

But how can we find β and γ?

From triangle XYZ: α + β = 75°, where α is angle at Y and β is angle at Z.

From triangle WXZ: γ + δ = 157°, where γ is angle at Z and δ is angle at W.

But we need more relations to find β and γ.

However, if we consider the angle at Z from triangle XZV, which is 24°. If that angle is related to β or γ.

Assume that ZV is a line such that angle XZV = 24°, which is the angle between XZ and ZV. So, if ZV is forming a line from Z, making 24° with XZ, then maybe that line ZV is aligned with either Y or W?

For example, if ZV is extending in the direction of Y, then angle XZV would be supplementary to angle β. Or if it's in the direction of W, then supplementary to γ.

Let me elaborate. Suppose that ZV is in the same direction as ZY. Then, angle between XZ and ZV would be angle between XZ and ZY, which is β. But the given is 24°, so β = 24°. Then, in triangle XYZ, α + β = 75°, so α = 75 - 24 = 51°. But this is assuming that ZV is aligned with ZY, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, if ZV is in the direction of ZW, then angle XZV would be angle between XZ and ZW, which is γ. Hence, γ = 24°. Then, in triangle WXZ, γ = 24°, so δ = 157 - 24 = 133°. But how does this help us?

If we assume that ZV is aligned with ZW, then angle XZV is 24°, which is γ. But then, how does this relate to angle 1?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is the angle between lines WZ and YZ, which would be β + γ, or something like that.

But without knowing β and γ, this is still unclear. However, if we can express β and γ in terms of other angles.

Wait, going back to the assumption that ZV is aligned with ZY, giving β = 24°, leading to α = 51°. Then, in triangle XYZ, angles are 105°, 24°, 51°, which sums to 105+24+51=180, yes. That works.

If that's the case, then β = 24°, which is angle at Z in triangle XYZ.

Then, what about angle γ in triangle WXZ? If ZV is aligned with ZY, then maybe there's no direct relation. But if there's another condition.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the angle between lines YZ and WZ, then that would be β + γ, assuming they are on opposite sides of XZ. But if β is 24° and γ is something else...

Wait, but how do we find γ? In triangle WXZ, we have angle at X is 23°, and angle at Z is γ. Without more info, we cannot determine γ. But if there's another condition.

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles at Z from different triangles. For example, if ZV forms a straight line with another line, creating supplementary angles.

Alternatively, since angle XZV is 24°, and if that is part of triangle XZV, then in triangle XZV, angles at Z is 24°, and if we can find other angles there.

But without knowing more about triangle XZV, it's hard to proceed. However, if we assume that triangle XZV is connected to other triangles, maybe there's a way.

Alternatively, think about the fact that the sum of angles around point Z should account for all angles created by the lines meeting at Z. For example, if there are lines ZY, ZW, ZX, and ZV, then the angles between these lines should add up appropriately.

Assuming that at point Z, the lines are:

- ZY (from triangle XYZ)

- ZX (common side)

- ZW (from triangle WXZ)

- ZV (from angle XZV = 24°)

These four lines meet at Z, forming various angles. The sum of all angles around point Z should be 360°. Let's consider the angles:

Between ZY and ZX: this is angle β (from triangle XYZ).

Between ZX and ZW: this is angle γ (from triangle WXZ).

Between ZW and ZV: ?

Between ZV and ZY: ?

Wait, but without knowing the order of these lines around Z, it's hard to define the exact angles. However, if we assume that ZV is forming an angle of 24° with ZX, then that would split the angle between ZX and ZV as 24°, and the rest of the angles would depend on other lines.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me recall that the answer options include 52.5, which is 105 / 2, and 37.5 is 75 / 2. Maybe angle 1 is an average of some angles.

Wait, let's consider the total angles at X. Earlier, we had angles of 105° and 23° at X. If these are two angles forming part of a larger structure, perhaps there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving these angles.

Alternatively, think about the exterior angle at X. For example, if there is a line extending from X, forming an angle that includes both 105° and 23°, but that's unclear.

Wait, another idea: Since angle at X between Y and Z is 105°, and between W and Z is 23°, maybe the angle between Y and W at X is 105 - 23 = 82°, or 105 + 23 = 128°, depending on their positions. If that's an angle in some triangle, maybe angle 1 is that.

But why would that be angle 1? Unless it's part of another triangle.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving points Y, W, and some other point, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, let's think about the sum of all angles in the entire figure. But without knowing the number of sides or the overall shape, it's not helpful.

Hmm, this is quite challenging without a diagram. Let me try to focus on the given angles and see if there's a way to combine them.

We have:

- Angle at X between Y and Z: 105°

- Angle at X between W and Z: 23°

- Angle at Z between X and V: 24°

Maybe angle 1 is the angle between lines W and V, or between lines Y and V?

Alternatively, if we consider triangle WZV or something similar.

Wait, let's assume that angle 1 is the angle at point Z between W and V. To find that, we need to know the angles at Z from triangle WXZ and the angle XZV.

Assume that at point Z, we have angle XZV = 24°, and angle between ZW and ZX is γ (from triangle WXZ). If ZV is forming 24° with ZX, then the angle between ZW and ZV would be γ - 24°, assuming γ > 24°, or 24° - γ if γ < 24°. But without knowing γ, we can't proceed.

But earlier, I assumed that angle β (at Z in triangle XYZ) was 24°, which led to α = 51°. If that's valid, then maybe γ is related to other angles.

Wait, if β = 24°, then in triangle XYZ, angles are 105°, 24°, and 51°. Now, what about triangle WXZ? Its angles are 23° at X, and γ at Z, and δ at W. If we could find γ, maybe through some relation.

But how? Maybe through the fact that lines from Z to V form angle 24°, which could be part of another triangle.

If ZV is a line such that it creates a triangle with Z and another point. For example, if V is on the extension of YZ, then angle XZV would be related to β.

But if I assume that ZV is on the extension of ZY, then angle XZV would be supplementary to β. So, β + 24° = 180°, implying β = 156°, which contradicts the previous assumption. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if ZV is forming an angle with ZY, then angle between ZY and ZV is 24°, so β - 24° = some other angle. Still, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the sum of angles in triangle XYZ and WXZ, and see if there's a way to relate them.

In triangle XYZ: angles are 105°, β, and α, where α + β = 75°.

In triangle WXZ: angles are 23°, γ, and δ, where γ + δ = 157°.

Now, if we can find a relationship between β and γ. For example, if lines YZ and WZ are on the same line, then β + γ = 180°, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through Z, making β + γ = 180°, then β + γ = 180°. But if β = 24°, then γ = 156°, but then in triangle WXZ, γ + δ = 157°, so δ = 157 - 156 = 1°, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, if β and γ are supplementary, then β + γ = 180°, but with β = 24°, γ = 156°, leading to δ = 157 - 156 = 1°, which is very small, but possible. However, this leads to a very sharp angle at W, which might not be meaningful.

Alternatively, if angle XZV = 24° is part of triangle XZV, and if we can find other angles there.

Assume triangle XZV has angle at Z of 24°, and if it's connected to other triangles, maybe through shared sides.

But without knowing more about triangle XZV, it's hard to proceed. However, if we assume that triangle XZV is connected to triangle XYZ or WXZ, perhaps through a common side.

For example, if V is on the line YZ, then angle XZV would be part of triangle XZV, and we could relate it to β.

But this is too many assumptions. Let me try to think differently.

Since the answer choices include 52.5, which is 105 / 2, and 37.5 is 75 / 2, maybe angle 1 is half of some sum.

Wait, the sum of the given angles at X is 105 + 23 = 128°. If there's a triangle involving these angles, maybe the third angle is 180 - 128 = 52°, which is close to option C (52.5). But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an external angle to a triangle, like the supplement of some angle.

Wait, let's think about the total angles around point X. If there are two angles at X: 105° and 23°, then the remaining angle around X is 360 - (105 + 23) = 232°, but this is the total of all other angles at X. However, if there's a line passing through X that creates a straight angle (180°), then the remaining angle would be 180 - 128 = 52°, which is close to option C.

Wait, this might be the key. If there's a straight line through X, such that the angles on one side of the line are 105° and 23°, and the other side is the remaining angle. But since 105 + 23 = 128°, which is less than 180°, the other side would have 180 - 128 = 52°, which is an angle that could be angle 1.

But how does this fit into the diagram? If there's a straight line through X, say, a line that passes through X and forms a straight angle (180°), then the angles on one side are 105° and 23°, totaling 128°, and the remaining angle on the other side is 52°, which could be angle 1. This would mean that angle 1 is 52°, which is close to option C (52.5). But since the given options don't have 52, but option C is 52.5, maybe there's a calculation error.

Wait, but where would this 52° come from? If it's an angle between two lines forming a straight line, but why would it be angle 1? Unless angle 1 is this 52°, which is approximately 52.5. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where one angle is 105°, another is 23°, and the third is 52°, which would sum to 105 + 23 + 52 = 180, which works. But this assumes that these three angles are in the same triangle, which they aren't. Because 105° is at X in one triangle, 23° at X in another, and 52° would be another angle. Not sure.

But given the answer choices, and the proximity of 52.5 to 52, it's possible that angle 1 is 52.5°, which would be option C.

Another way: 105 + 23 = 128°, and if angle 1 is the supplement of this, 180 - 128 = 52°, but since the answer choices have 52.5, perhaps due to some division or averaging.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where angle 1 is the average of 105 and 23, which is (105 + 23)/2 = 64, which is not an option. Or maybe (105 - 23)/2 = 41, not matching.

Wait, but there's also the angle at Z, 24°, and maybe combining that with other angles.

If angle at Z is 24°, and if angle 1 is supplementary to that, 180 - 24 = 156, not in options.

Or if angle 1 is the sum of 23 and 24, which is 47, which is option B.

Wait, 23 + 24 = 47, which is option B. Could that be?

But why would angle 1 be the sum of these two angles? If angle 1 is the angle between W and V, for example, and those two angles are adjacent, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the angle between WZ and XV, or something like that. But without knowing the configuration, it's hard to say.

But given that 23 + 24 = 47, which is option B, and 105 - 23 = 82, not in options. 105 - 24 = 81, not in options. 23 + 24 = 47, which is option B.

But why would angle 1 be 47? Maybe it's the third angle in a triangle where two angles are 23 and 24. But that would give 180 - 23 - 24 = 133, which is option D.

Wait, but that's if angle 1 is the third angle in a triangle with angles 23 and 24. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles 23°, 24°, and angle 1, then angle 1 = 180 - 23 - 24 = 133°, which is option D. But why would that triangle exist?

Maybe if lines WZ and XV intersect at some point, forming a triangle with angles 23°, 24°, and angle 1. But again, this is speculation.

Alternatively, since angle at X is 105°, and angle at X between W and Z is 23°, and angle XZV is 24°, maybe angle 1 is formed by extending some lines.

This is really challenging without seeing the diagram. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll consider the most plausible options based on the given data.

Option C is 52.5, which is half of 105°, and option B is 47, which is 23 + 24. Option D is 133, which is 180 - 23 - 24. Option A is 37.5, which is half of 75.

Wait, let's think about the angles around point X again. If there are two angles at X: 105° and 23°, and if there's a straight line passing through X, then the total of these two angles would be 128°, and the remaining angle on the other side would be 180 - 128 = 52°. If angle 1 is this 52°, but since 52 isn't an option, but 52.5 is, maybe due to some calculation.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the average of 105 and 23, which is 64, not an option. Or if it's the average of 105 and 24, which is 64.5, not an option.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is related to the angles at Z. Suppose at point Z, we have angle XZV = 24°, and if that is part of a triangle with angles 23° and angle 1, then 23 + 24 + angle1 = 180 => angle1 = 133, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? If there's a triangle with angles 23°, 24°, and angle1, then angle1 = 133°. This fits option D.

But why would that triangle exist? Maybe triangle WXZ and XZV are part of a larger triangle.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the third angle in a triangle where two angles are 23° and 24°, then it's 133°, which is option D.

This seems plausible. So, if angle 1 is the third angle in a triangle with angles 23° and 24°, then the answer would be D.

But how to justify that? If there's a triangle where two angles are 23° and 24°, then the third angle is 133°, which is option D.

But why would those two angles be part of the same triangle? Maybe if lines WZ and XV intersect at some point, forming a triangle with those angles.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an external angle to a triangle, but I'm not sure.

Given that 133 is one of the options, and it's the result of 180 - 23 - 24, it's possible that angle 1 is 133°, making option D the answer.

But earlier thoughts suggested 52.5 as well. Which is more likely?

Let me re-examine the problem statement. The given predicates include Angle(X,Z,V) = 24°, which is at Z. So, angle at Z between X and V is 24°. Also, angle at X between W and Z is 23°, and at X between Y and Z is 105°.

If we consider triangle WZV, but we don't know if V is connected to W. Or triangle XZV, which has angle at Z of 24°, and if we can find other angles there.

If we assume that in triangle XZV, angle at Z is 24°, and angle at X is 23°, then the third angle at V would be 180 - 24 - 23 = 133°, which would be angle1. But why would angle at X in triangle XZV be 23°?

Because angle at X between W and Z is 23°, and if line XV is aligned with line WX, then angle at X would be 23°. But this requires that V is on the line WX, making XV extend from X through W, but that's speculative.

If this is the case, then in triangle XZV, angles at X is 23°, at Z is 24°, and at V is 133°, which would be angle1. Thus, answer D.

This seems plausible. So, angle1 is 133°, option D.

But earlier thinking suggested 52.5. Why the discrepancy?

It depends on whether angle1 is in triangle XZV or elsewhere.

Given that the answer options include 133, and that it's a direct calculation from 180 - 23 - 24, it's likely that this is the intended path.

Therefore, I'll go with option D.
