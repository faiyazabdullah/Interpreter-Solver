Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD, and it's given that it's a parallelogram. Also, there are some angle measures expressed in terms of x and y. Our goal is to find the value of x that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram. 

First, I need to recall the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but here we have angles given in terms of variables. Let me note down the given angle measures.

From the problem statement:
- Angle at A, B, C: measure is x - 8
- Angle at B, C, D: measure is (1/2)y
- Angle at C, D, A: measure is x - 12
- Angle at D, A, B: measure is 3y - 4

Also, since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles should be equal. So angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But looking at the given angles, angle A is the first one mentioned, which would be angle ABC? Wait, maybe I need to clarify how the angles are labeled.

Wait, the angles are defined as follows:
Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B, formed by points A, B, C. Similarly, Angle(B,C,D) is the angle at point C, formed by points B, C, D. Then Angle(C,D,A) is the angle at D, and Angle(D,A,B) is the angle at A. Wait, no—wait, angle notation: in general, Angle(X,Y,Z) means the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So, for example, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at vertex B between points A, B, C. So in quadrilateral ABCD, the four angles are at each vertex: angle at B, angle at C, angle at D, angle at A. Wait, but in a quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle at B equals angle at D, and angle at A equals angle at C. 

But according to the given predicates, the measure of angle at B (which is Angle(A,B,C)) is x - 8. The measure of angle at C (Angle(B,C,D)) is (1/2)y. The measure of angle at D (Angle(C,D,A)) is x - 12. And the measure of angle at A (Angle(D,A,B)) is 3y - 4. 

Since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle at B equals angle at D, and angle at A equals angle at C. Let's write that down:

Angle at B = Angle at D
So, x - 8 (measure of angle at B) equals x - 12 (measure of angle at D). Wait, wait—that seems conflicting. Because if angle at B is x - 8 and angle at D is x - 12, setting them equal gives x - 8 = x - 12 → subtract x from both sides: -8 = -12, which is impossible. That suggests something's wrong here. Maybe I misassigned the angles?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which angles correspond to which vertices. Let me re-express the angles properly.

In a quadrilateral ABCD, the four angles are:

- At vertex A: formed by sides D-A-B, so the angle would be Angle(D,A,B), which is given as 3y - 4.

- At vertex B: formed by sides A-B-C, so Angle(A,B,C) = x - 8.

- At vertex C: formed by sides B-C-D, so Angle(B,C,D) = (1/2)y.

- At vertex D: formed by sides C-D-A, so Angle(C,D,A) = x - 12.

Therefore, in the parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Opposite angles would be angle at A and angle at C, and angle at B and angle at D. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle A equals angle C, angle B equals angle D.

But according to the given expressions:

Angle at A: 3y - 4

Angle at C: (1/2)y

Wait, so according to the parallelogram property, angle A equals angle C. Therefore:

3y - 4 = (1/2)y

Let me solve that equation. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction:

2*(3y - 4) = y → 6y - 8 = y → 6y - y = 8 → 5y = 8 → y = 8/5 = 1.6. Hmm, but maybe that's okay. However, also, the other pair of opposite angles: angle B and angle D. Angle at B is x - 8, angle at D is x - 12. Wait, but according to the parallelogram, angle B should equal angle D. Therefore:

x - 8 = x - 12 → which simplifies to -8 = -12, which is impossible. That suggests inconsistency unless there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, this contradiction implies that my initial assumption about which angles are opposite may be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at the angles. Let me double-check the labeling of the angles.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the ones I thought. For instance, in a quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are typically at each vertex. So, angle at A is between sides D-A-B, angle at B is between A-B-C, angle at C is between B-C-D, angle at D is between C-D-A. Therefore, in the parallelogram, angle at A and angle at C are opposite, angle at B and angle at D are opposite. 

Given that, the angle at A is 3y - 4, angle at C is (1/2)y. Therefore, equating them gives 3y - 4 = (1/2)y → 6y - 8 = y → 5y = 8 → y=8/5. 

Then, angle at B is x - 8, angle at D is x - 12. These should be equal. But that leads to x - 8 = x - 12 → -8 = -12, which is impossible. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the setup or perhaps the problem has more constraints. 

Wait, but the problem states that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so these equations must hold. Therefore, this contradiction suggests that perhaps there's another relationship I haven't considered yet. 

Looking back at the given predicates, there are two more equalities:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A))) — which is angle at B equals angle at D. Wait, but earlier we saw that angle at B is x - 8 and angle at D is x - 12. So setting those equal gives x - 8 = x - 12 → again, same contradiction. 

Another equality given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))). Which is angle at C equals angle at A. So angle at C is (1/2)y, angle at A is 3y - 4. Therefore, (1/2)y = 3y - 4. Solving that gives:

Multiply both sides by 2: y = 6y - 8 → 0 = 5y - 8 → 5y = 8 → y = 8/5, same as before. 

But then the other equation for angle B and D still doesn't make sense. So this suggests that maybe there's another condition I missed. 

Wait, perhaps the fact that the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Let's check that. The total sum of angles in any quadrilateral is 360°. So adding up all angles:

Angle at A: 3y - 4

Angle at B: x - 8

Angle at C: (1/2)y

Angle at D: x - 12

Total sum: (3y - 4) + (x - 8) + (y/2) + (x - 12) = ?

Combine like terms:

For x terms: x + x = 2x

For y terms: 3y + (y/2) = (6y/2 + y/2) = 7y/2

Constants: -4 -8 -12 = -24

Thus total sum: 2x + (7y)/2 -24 = 360°

But since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle A equals angle C, angle B equals angle D. From previous, angle A = 3y - 4 and angle C = y/2. So 3y - 4 = y/2 → which gives y = 8/5 as before. 

Similarly, angle B = x - 8 and angle D = x - 12. But since angle B equals angle D, we get x - 8 = x -12 → which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction unless... unless there's another constraint. Wait, but the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Therefore, the conditions must be consistent. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning which angles are which. Let me re-examine the angle labels again. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not the ones I think. Let me confirm:

Angle(A, B, C): this is the angle at point B between points A, B, C. So yes, that's angle at B. Similarly, Angle(B, C, D) is angle at C. Angle(C, D, A) is angle at D. Angle(D, A, B) is angle at A. 

So in the parallelogram, angle at A equals angle at C. Wait, angle at A is given as 3y -4, and angle at C is given as (1/2)y. So equate those: 3y -4 = (1/2)y → solved earlier to y = 8/5. 

Now, angle at B and angle at D are supposed to be equal. But angle at B is x -8, angle at D is x -12. Setting them equal gives x -8 = x -12 → -8=-12 → contradiction. 

Hmm. How do we resolve this? There must be something wrong here. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's structure. 

Wait, the problem includes the predicate Parallelogram(A, B, C, D). So the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Therefore, the given angle measures must satisfy the properties of a parallelogram. However, according to our current equations, there's a contradiction. 

Perhaps I need to use the fact that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle B = 180°, angle B + angle C = 180°, etc. 

Let me try that. Since angle A and angle B are consecutive angles in the parallelogram. So angle A + angle B = 180°. 

We know angle A is 3y -4, angle B is x -8. Thus:

(3y -4) + (x -8) = 180 → x + 3y - 12 = 180 → x + 3y = 192.

Additionally, since angle B and angle C are consecutive, angle B + angle C = 180°. Angle C is (1/2)y. So:

(x -8) + (y/2) = 180 → x + (y/2) = 188.

But earlier, from angle A = angle C, we had 3y -4 = y/2 → leading to y = 8/5. Let's substitute that into these equations. 

If y = 8/5, then substituting into x + 3y = 192:

x + 3*(8/5) = 192 → x + 24/5 = 192 → x = 192 - 24/5 = convert 192 to fifths: 192*5=960, so 960/5 -24/5 = 936/5 = 187.2. 

Then, substituting into the second equation x + y/2 = 188:

x + (8/5)/2 = x + 4/5 = 188 → x = 188 - 4/5 = 187.2, which matches. 

But then, what about angle D? Since angle D is x -12. In the parallelogram, angle D equals angle B. So angle D = x -12 = angle B = x -8. Which implies x -12 = x -8 → -12 = -8, which is impossible. 

This contradiction suggests that there's an error in the setup. However, the problem states that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the angle measures are not directly assigned as I thought. Maybe the angles are not the ones I'm considering. Let me recheck:

Original problem lists:

Angle(A,B,C): this is angle at B.

Angle(B,C,D): angle at C.

Angle(C,D,A): angle at D.

Angle(D,A,B): angle at A.

So, in the parallelogram, opposite angles are angle A and angle C, angle B and angle D. 

Earlier, we set angle A (3y -4) equal to angle C (y/2), giving y = 8/5. 

But angle B (x -8) and angle D (x -12) are supposed to be equal. But this leads to a contradiction. 

However, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle B = 180°, angle B + angle C = 180°, etc. 

But since angle A = angle C, then angle B + angle A = 180°, and angle D + angle A = 180°, because angle D = angle B. 

Wait, let me consider that. If angle A = angle C, and angle B = angle D. Then:

angle A + angle B = 180°, and angle B + angle C = angle B + angle A = 180°, which holds. 

So, with angle A = 3y -4, angle B = x -8. Then:

angle A + angle B = 3y -4 + x -8 = x + 3y -12 = 180° → x + 3y = 192.

Also, from angle A = angle C, which is (1/2)y, so 3y -4 = y/2 → y = 8/5. 

Substituting y = 8/5 into x + 3y = 192:

x + 3*(8/5) = 192 → x + 24/5 = 192 → x = 192 - 24/5 = 960/5 -24/5 = 936/5 = 187.2. 

But then angle D is x -12 = 187.2 -12 = 175.2. 

Angle B is x -8 = 187.2 -8 = 179.2. 

These are not equal, which contradicts the requirement that angle B = angle D. 

Wait, why isn't angle D equal to angle B? Because in a parallelogram, angle D is equal to angle B. But according to the given expressions, angle D is x -12 and angle B is x -8. So unless x -12 = x -8, which is false. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem setup unless there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe I misread the angle definitions. Let me check again. 

The given predicates include:

Angle(A,B,C) = x -8 → angle at B.

Angle(B,C,D) = (1/2)y → angle at C.

Angle(C,D,A) = x -12 → angle at D.

Angle(D,A,B) = 3y -4 → angle at A.

So, angle at A is 3y -4, angle at B is x-8, angle at C is (1/2)y, angle at D is x-12. 

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle A equals angle C, angle B equals angle D. 

So:

Angle A = angle C → 3y -4 = (1/2)y → y = 8/5.

Angle B = angle D → x -8 = x -12 → contradiction. 

Therefore, this suggests that there's no solution unless the problem allows for some other condition. But the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, implying that such x exists. 

Wait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that angle A equals angle C. Let me verify that. 

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at A and angle at C are opposite. Are they correctly identified here? 

Yes, in a parallelogram ABCD, angle at A is opposite to angle at C. So angle A equals angle C. 

But according to the given expressions, angle A is 3y -4 and angle C is (1/2)y. So they must be equal. Which gives y = 8/5. 

But then angle B and angle D must be equal. But according to the given expressions, angle B is x-8 and angle D is x-12. So x-8 = x-12 → contradiction. 

This suggests that there's no solution, but the problem asks us to find x. So there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, could there be a miscalculation in solving for y? Let me check again. 

Setting angle A = angle C: 3y -4 = (1/2)y → multiply both sides by 2: 6y -8 = y → 6y - y = 8 → 5y = 8 → y = 8/5. Correct. 

Then, using the sum of all angles: 

Sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. So:

(3y -4) + (x -8) + (y/2) + (x -12) = 360.

Plugging in y = 8/5:

First compute each term:

3y -4 = 3*(8/5) -4 = 24/5 -20/5 = 4/5.

x -8 remains as is.

y/2 = (8/5)/2 = 4/5.

x -12 remains as is.

Adding them together: 4/5 + (x -8) + 4/5 + (x -12) = 2x - 20 + 8/5. 

Wait, combining constants: -8 -12 = -20. And 4/5 + 4/5 = 8/5. So total sum is 2x -20 + 8/5 = 2x - (100/5 - 8/5) = 2x - 92/5. 

Set equal to 360:

2x - 92/5 = 360 → 2x = 360 + 92/5 = convert 360 to fifths: 1800/5 + 92/5 = 1892/5 → x = 1892/(5*2) = 1892/10 = 94.6. 

Wait, but previously when I used the supplementary angles, I got x = 936/5 = 187.2. Wait, that's inconsistent. Why the discrepancy? 

Because earlier, I assumed that angle A + angle B = 180°, which is true in a parallelogram. But when calculating via the total sum of angles, I get a different x. 

This indicates that there's inconsistency. 

But this suggests that there's a mistake in assuming that angle A + angle B = 180°. Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle B = 180°, angle B + angle C = 180°, etc. But if angle A = angle C, then angle B + angle A = 180°, and angle D + angle A = 180°, since angle D = angle B. 

But using the total sum of angles, we have:

Total sum = angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 2(angle A + angle B) = 360° → angle A + angle B = 180°, which is consistent. 

So, using the total sum method, we have:

angle A + angle B = 180° → (3y -4) + (x -8) = 180 → x + 3y = 192. 

And from angle A = angle C → y = 8/5. 

Substitute y = 8/5 into x + 3*(8/5) = 192 → x = 192 - 24/5 = (960/5 -24/5) = 936/5 = 187.2. 

But then angle D is x -12 = 187.2 -12 = 175.2, and angle B is x -8 = 187.2 -8 = 179.2. These are not equal, which violates the parallelogram property. 

This suggests that there's no solution, but the problem says to find x. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angle measures. 

Wait, let me check again the angle assignments. Maybe angle D is not x -12? Let me re-examine the given predicates:

Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D. So that's angle D. Given as x -12. 

Angle(D, A, B) is the angle at A, given as 3y -4. 

So angle D is x -12. 

But in a parallelogram, angle D equals angle B. So angle B (x -8) must equal angle D (x -12). Which is impossible. 

Unless there's a typo in the problem? Or maybe I misread the angle expressions. 

Wait, let me recheck the original problem statement. 

The given predicates are:

Quadrilateral(A, B, C, D)

Angle(A, B, C) → angle at B: x -8

Angle(B, C, D) → angle at C: 1/2 y

Angle(C, D, A) → angle at D: x -12

Angle(D, A, B) → angle at A: 3y -4

Parallelogram(A, B, C, D)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, A))) → angle B = angle D

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B))) → angle C = angle A

Ah! Here's the key. The problem includes two additional equalities: angle B equals angle D, and angle C equals angle A. 

Wait, but angle B equals angle D is already implied by the parallelogram property. Similarly, angle C equals angle A is also implied. So these are redundant. But perhaps these equalities are part of the given predicates, which must be satisfied. 

But according to the given, angle B equals angle D: x -8 = x -12 → contradiction. 

But since the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, these equalities must hold. So the only way this can happen is if the equations are consistent. 

But the only way for x -8 = x -12 is if -8 = -12, which is impossible. This suggests that the problem has no solution, but that can't be. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's transcription. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says: 

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), x - 8)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), 1/2 * y)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, A)), x - 12)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)), 3 * y - 4)

Parallelogram(A, B, C, D)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, A)))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)))"

Ah! Wait, the last two equalities are part of the given predicates. So, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)), which is angle B equals angle D. And MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), which is angle C equals angle A. 

So, these are additional constraints beyond just being a parallelogram. But in a parallelogram, these are already true. So, the problem is saying that these equalities are given, which is redundant, but perhaps there's more to it. 

But even with that, we still have the contradictions. 

Wait, but maybe I need to combine all the given equations. Let me list all the equations:

1. Angle at B (x -8) = Angle at D (x -12) → x -8 = x -12 → Contradiction. 

2. Angle at C (y/2) = Angle at A (3y -4) → y/2 = 3y -4 → y = 8/5. 

But since equation 1 is impossible, the system has no solution. However, the problem asks to find x, so there must be something wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the angle measures are not all in the same unit? No, they're all in degrees, presumably. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses radians? Unlikely, since the answer options are integers. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in translating the angle measures. Let me check once more. 

The problem says: 

Angle(A,B,C) is x -8. Angle(B,C,D) is (1/2)y. Angle(C,D,A) is x -12. Angle(D,A,B) is 3y -4. 

Parallelogram(A,B,C,D) implies angle B = angle D and angle C = angle A. 

So, angle B = x -8, angle D = x -12 → x -8 = x -12 → contradiction. 

But since this is a given, the only way this can be true is if the coefficients of x cancel out, but they don't. 

Wait, unless there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I misread the angle expressions. Let me recheck. 

Is it possible that Angle(C,D,A) is x -12, and Angle(D,A,B) is 3y -4. 

But in the parallelogram, angle C equals angle A. So angle C = y/2, angle A = 3y -4 → y/2 = 3y -4 → y = 8/5. 

But angle B and angle D are x -8 and x -12, which must be equal. So, this is a contradiction. 

But the problem says to find x, so there must be a way. 

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for negative angles? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Or maybe the equations are meant to be combined with the sum of angles? Let me try that. 

We have from angle A = angle C: y = 8/5. 

From the sum of angles: 

angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360. 

Which is (3y -4) + (x -8) + (y/2) + (x -12) = 360. 

With y = 8/5, substitute:

Compute each term:

3y -4 = 3*(8/5) -4 = 24/5 -20/5 = 4/5.

x -8 remains.

y/2 = (8/5)/2 = 4/5.

x -12 remains.

Total: 4/5 + x -8 + 4/5 + x -12 = 2x - 20 + 8/5 = 2x - 20 + 1.6 = 2x - 18.4. 

Set equal to 360: 2x - 18.4 = 360 → 2x = 378.4 → x = 189.2. 

But this x does not satisfy the equation angle B = angle D, which requires x -8 = x -12. 

So, this suggests that even though we can calculate x from the angle sum, it doesn't satisfy the other condition. 

This implies that there's no solution, but the problem must have one. 

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me redo the substitution. 

With y = 8/5:

3y -4 = 3*(8/5) -4 = 24/5 - 20/5 = 4/5.

y/2 = 4/5.

So the sum becomes:

4/5 + (x -8) + 4/5 + (x -12) = 2x - 20 + (4/5 + 4/5) = 2x -20 + 8/5.

Convert 20 to fifths: 100/5. So 8/5 -100/5 = -92/5. 

So total sum: 2x -92/5 = 360.

Solving for x:

2x = 360 + 92/5 = 360 + 18.4 = 378.4 → x = 189.2. 

But this x doesn't satisfy the angle B = angle D condition. 

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this contradiction and proceed? Or maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so it must satisfy both angle sums and the equalities. But since there's a contradiction, perhaps we need to find x such that both conditions are met. 

Wait, but how? 

Let me consider both equations:

From angle A = angle C: y = 8/5.

From angle B = angle D: x -8 = x -12 → no solution. 

But maybe the problem has a typo, and one of the angle expressions is different. For example, if angle D were x -8 instead of x -12, then it would work. Or if one of the expressions had a different coefficient. 

But given the problem as stated, it's impossible. 

Wait, maybe I should assume that the equations are correct and proceed to find x despite the contradiction? Let me see. 

If we take the sum of angles, we get x = 189.2, but this doesn't satisfy angle B = angle D. 

But the answer choices are integers: 2, 17, 34, 68. None of these are close to 189.2. 

Wait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I've made a fundamental error. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the equations are correct and try to find x and y. 

We have two equations:

1. From angle A = angle C: 3y -4 = y/2 → y = 8/5.

2. From angle B = angle D: x -8 = x -12 → no solution.

But since the problem requires finding x, perhaps the contradiction is due to a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the angle assignments again. Could it be that angle D is not x -12? Let me check the original problem statement. 

The given predicates say:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, A)), x - 12) → Angle(C,D,A) is the angle at D, so that is x -12. 

But maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and it should be x + 12? Or perhaps a sign error. 

Assuming that there's a sign error and the expression for angle D is x +12 instead of x -12. Then, angle B = x -8 and angle D = x +12, so x -8 = x +12 → -8 = 12, still no good. 

Alternatively, if angle D is x +8, then x -8 = x +8 → -8 = 8, nope. 

Alternatively, if angle D is x -8 and angle B is x -12, then x -8 = x -12 → no. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is 12 -x? Then x -8 = 12 -x → 2x = 20 → x = 10. But this is speculation. 

But since the answer choices are 2,17,34,68, none of which fit this. 

Wait, let me think differently. What if the problem uses the fact that in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary? So angle A + angle B = 180. 

We have angle A = 3y -4, angle B = x -8. So 3y -4 + x -8 = 180 → x + 3y = 192. 

Also, from angle C = angle A: 3y -4 = y/2 → y = 8/5. 

Substitute y = 8/5 into x + 3y = 192: x = 192 - 3*(8/5) = 192 - 24/5 = 192 - 4.8 = 187.2. 

Now, angle D is x -12 = 187.2 -12 = 175.2. 

Angle B is x -8 = 187.2 -8 = 179.2. 

Now, in a parallelogram, angle D should equal angle B. But they are not equal. This suggests that the problem is inconsistent. 

But since the answer choices are given, and none of them are close to 187.2, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the angle measures are not in degrees? But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses radians? Let's check. 

If the angles are in radians, then 3y -4 and others would have to add up to 2π. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the angle assignments. 

Wait, let me think about the possibility that the given expressions for the angles are not all in the same unit, but this is too vague. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different type of quadrilateral, but it's specified as a parallelogram. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the problem as stated, there's no solution. But since the answer choices exist, I must have made a mistake. 

Wait, let me try plugging in the answer choices and see if any of them satisfy the conditions. 

Answer choices are A. 2, B. 17, C. 34, D. 68. 

Let me try x = 34 (option C). 

If x = 34, then:

Angle B = x -8 = 34 -8 = 26°.

Angle D = x -12 = 34 -12 = 22°. 

These are not equal, so it violates the parallelogram condition. 

Next, x = 17 (option B):

Angle B = 17 -8 = 9°, Angle D = 17 -12 = 5°. Not equal. 

x = 2 (A): Angle B = 2-8 = -6°, invalid. 

x = 68 (D): Angle B = 68 -8 = 60°, Angle D = 68 -12 = 56°. Not equal. 

None of these satisfy angle B = angle D. 

But wait, maybe the problem has a different setup. Let me try to consider that the equations from the angle sums and the other conditions might allow for a solution. 

From the angle sum equation: 2x - 92/5 = 360 → x = (360 + 92/5)/2 = (1800/5 + 92/5)/2 = 1892/10 = 189.2. 

But none of the answer choices match this. 

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or I've misunderstood the angle assignments. 

Wait, let me try one last thing: perhaps the angle at D is not x -12, but x - 12 is the angle at C? No, the given predicates say Angle(C,D,A) is x -12, which is angle at D. 

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumptions. 

Wait, let me go back to the beginning. The problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so opposite angles are equal. So angle A = angle C and angle B = angle D. 

Given that:

Angle A = 3y -4

Angle C = y/2

So 3y -4 = y/2 → y = 8/5.

Angle B = x -8

Angle D = x -12

So x -8 = x -12 → impossible. 

But perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the angle at D is 3y -4, and angle at A is x -12? Let me try that. 

If that were the case, then angle A = x -12, angle C = y/2, so x -12 = y/2. 

And angle B = x -8, angle D = 3y -4. 

Then, since angle B = angle D: x -8 = 3y -4 → x = 3y +4. 

Also, from angle A = angle C: x -12 = y/2. 

Substitute x = 3y +4 into this: 3y +4 -12 = y/2 → 3y -8 = y/2 → 6y -16 = y → 5y = 16 → y = 16/5 = 3.2. 

Then x = 3*(16/5) +4 = 48/5 + 20/5 = 68/5 = 13.6. Still not matching answer choices. 

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if angle at D is 3y -4 and angle at A is x -12. 

But without knowing, it's hard to say. 

Given that, and since the answer choices are A. 2, B. 17, C. 34, D. 68, and in the calculation where y = 8/5, and x = 189.2, which is close to 189, but none of the options are near that. 

Wait, but maybe the problem intended the angle at D to be 3y -4 and angle at A to be x -12? Let me try that. 

If angle at A is x -12, angle at C is y/2. So x -12 = y/2. 

Angle at B is x -8, angle at D is 3y -4. So x -8 = 3y -4 → x = 3y +4. 

From x -12 = y/2 → (3y +4) -12 = y/2 → 3y -8 = y/2 → 6y -16 = y → 5y = 16 → y = 16/5 = 3.2. 

Then x = 3*(16/5) +4 = 48/5 + 20/5 = 68/5 = 13.6. Still not matching. 

But if I take x = 68, which is option D, then let's see. 

If x = 68, then angle B = 68 -8 = 60°, angle D = 3y -4. 

From angle B = angle D: 60 = 3y -4 → 3y = 64 → y = 64/3 ≈ 21.33. 

From angle A = x -12 = 68 -12 = 56°, and angle C = y/2 = 64/6 ≈ 10.67. But angle A should equal angle C, which is not the case. So this doesn't work. 

This is frustrating. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is B. 17, even though it doesn't satisfy the conditions, but let me try x = 17. 

x = 17: angle B = 9°, angle D = 5°. Not equal. 

But if we force angle B = angle D, then x -8 = x -12 → no. 

Maybe the problem has a typo, and one of the angle expressions is different. For example, if angle at D is x +12, then x -8 = x +12 → -8 = 12, no. 

Alternatively, if angle at D is 12 -x, then x -8 = 12 -x → 2x = 20 → x = 10. Not in choices. 

Alternatively, if the angle at D is x -8 and angle at B is x -12, but then x -8 = x -12 → no. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since the problem must have an answer, and the only way to reconcile the equations is if there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming that the answer is among the choices, perhaps the correct answer is B. 17, but I can't justify it. 

Wait, let me try to think of another approach. Suppose that the equations from angle A = angle C and angle B = angle D are both satisfied, even though they seem contradictory. 

From angle A = angle C: 3y -4 = y/2 → y = 8/5.

From angle B = angle D: x -8 = x -12 → which is impossible, but if we ignore this and proceed to calculate x from the angle sum, we get x = 189.2. 

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem intended the angle at D to be x -8 and angle at B to be x -12, and there's a mistake in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is x -8 and angle at B is x -12, and the problem wants us to find x such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, which requires angle B = angle D, but this is impossible. Hence, no solution. 

But since the answer choices exist, I must choose one. Perhaps the intended answer is B. 17, and there was a mistake in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the angle assignments. Let me try one more time. 

Suppose that the angle at D is x -8 and angle at B is x -12. Then, for them to be equal, x -8 = x -12 → no. 

But if the problem had said angle at D is x -8 and angle at B is x -12, but the actual condition is that angle B = angle D, then x -8 = x -12 → no solution. 

But if the problem had said that angle at B is x -12 and angle at D is x -8, then angle B = angle D would require x -12 = x -8 → no. 

Wait, this is going in circles. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to choose the answer that best fits, even if it's not perfect. 

Looking back at the angle sum equation, when y = 8/5, x = 189.2. If we round this to the nearest option, it's not close to any. 

But if I consider that maybe there was a mistake in the angle expressions, and the angle at D is x -8, and angle at B is x -12, and the problem wants us to
