MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a rectangle DEFG. Wait, rectangles have four right angles, right? Each angle in a rectangle is 90 degrees. But the problem mentions some angles with measures involving x. Let me parse the given info again.

First, the predicates say that Rectangle(D,E,F,G). So points D, E, F, G form a rectangle. Then there are several RightAngle predicates. For example, Angle(D,G,F) is a right angle. Similarly for others. That makes sense because all angles in a rectangle are right angles. But then they also mention angles EFD and DFG with expressions involving x. Hmm, maybe those angles aren't the right angles? Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary? No, wait, each angle is 90 degrees. So if EFD and DFG are angles inside the rectangle, how come they are expressed with variables?

Wait, perhaps I need to visualize the rectangle. Let me sketch it mentally. Let's assume the rectangle is labeled in order D-E-F-G-D. So sides DE, EF, FG, GD. So the corners are D connected to E and G; E connected to D and F; F connected to E and G; G connected to F and D. 

Now, angle EFD would be at point F, between points E, F, D. Wait, so that's angle at F between E and D. Since it's a rectangle, angle at F should be 90 degrees. But according to the problem, measure of angle EFD is 2x - 3. Similarly, angle DFG is at point F between D, F, G. Which is another angle at point F. Wait, but in a rectangle, each corner has a right angle. So angle EFD and angle DFG are two angles at point F? Wait, but that seems conflicting because in a rectangle, each vertex has one angle. Unless these angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle. Maybe they are other angles formed by diagonals?

Oh! Wait, maybe there's a diagonal involved. Because in the predicates, there's Line(D,F) and Line(E,G). So lines DF and EG are drawn. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So if DF and EG are diagonals, then they intersect at the center. But the problem mentions angles EFD and DFG. Let me think about that.

So, point F is connected to D (diagonal), forming line DF. So angle EFD is at point F, between E and D. So that would be the angle between side FE and diagonal FD. Similarly, angle DFG is at point F between D and G. Which would be the angle between diagonal FD and side FG. Since in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So FE is perpendicular to FG. Therefore, the angles around point F created by the diagonal FD would add up to 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, the total angle at point F in the rectangle is 90 degrees. If we draw a diagonal from F to D, splitting that 90-degree angle into two parts: angle EFD and angle DFG. Therefore, those two angles should add up to 90 degrees. Wait, but the problem says that sum of measure of angle EFD and DFG equals 180. Wait, that contradicts unless my assumption is wrong.

Wait, looking back at the given predicates: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,G))), 180). So the sum of those two angles is 180 degrees. But if they are adjacent angles at point F, they should add up to the total angle at F, which is 90 degrees. So something's wrong here. Maybe my understanding of the angles is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not adjacent? Or perhaps I misread the angle labels. Let me check again. Angle(E,F,D): that's the angle at point F between points E, F, D. So yes, that's the angle between FE and FD. Similarly, angle(D,F,G) is the angle at F between D, F, G, so between FD and FG. So together, those two angles make up the angle between FE and FG, which is the original angle at F of the rectangle. But since FE and FG are perpendicular, that angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the sum of those two angles should be 90 degrees, not 180. However, the given equation says their sum is 180. There's a contradiction here. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the angles are not adjacent? Or maybe the diagram isn't a rectangle? But the first predicate says it's a rectangle. Alternatively, maybe the angles are not inside the rectangle. Wait, maybe angle DFG refers to a different configuration. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. So the shape is a rectangle. Now, the angles mentioned: angle EFD and angle DFG. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Suppose we assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place point D at (0,0), E at (a,0), F at (a,b), and G at (0,b). So sides DE is horizontal, EF vertical, FG horizontal left, and GD vertical down.

Then, line DF connects D(0,0) to F(a,b). So angle EFD is at point F between E(a,0), F(a,b), D(0,0). So that's the angle between FE (which goes from F to E, direction towards (-a, 0)) and FD (from F to D, direction towards (-a,-b)). Similarly, angle DFG is at point F between D(0,0), F(a,b), G(0,b). So that's the angle between FD (from F to D, direction (-a,-b)) and FG (from F to G, direction (-a, b)).

Wait, so in this coordinate system, angle EFD is between FE (left along x-axis) and FD (down-left diagonal). And angle DFG is between FD (down-left) and FG (up-left). These two angles would add up to the angle between FE and FG. But FE is pointing left, FG is pointing up-left. Wait, actually, FE is from F to E, which is left along x-axis. FG is from F to G, which is straight left along y-axis? Wait, no. Point G is at (0,b). So from F(a,b) to G(0,b) is left along horizontal line. So FG is horizontal left. FE is from F(a,b) to E(a,0), which is straight down. So angle EFD is between FE (straight down) and FD (diagonal to D). Angle DFG is between FD (diagonal to D) and FG (straight left). Wait, but FE is straight down, FG is straight left. So the angle between FE and FG is 90 degrees. But the two angles EFD and DFG are parts of that 90-degree angle. Wait, but according to the given equation, their sum is 180. How?

This suggests that either my interpretation of the angles is wrong, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-express the angles. Maybe the angles are not within the rectangle but outside? Or perhaps the lines DF and EG are creating some other angles?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the angles are not the ones I'm thinking. For instance, angle EFD could be referring to a different configuration. Let me double-check the notation. In standard notation, angle EFD means the angle at point F between points E, F, D. So yes, that's the angle at F between E and D. Similarly, angle DFG is at F between D, F, G. So those are two angles at F. But in the rectangle, the angle at F is between E and G, which is 90 degrees. Wait, but if you split that angle with diagonal DF, then the two angles (EFD and DFG) would add up to 90 degrees, not 180. Hence, the given condition that their sum is 180 must be wrong. But the problem says that Equals(SumOf(...), 180). This inconsistency suggests that there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not adjacent? Like, maybe angle EFD is part of a triangle or something else? Or maybe the lines DF and EG are not just diagonals but something else? Let me check the given predicates again. There's Line(D,F) and Line(E,G). So DF and EG are diagonals. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So the intersection of DF and EG would be the center of the rectangle. However, if we look at angles EFD and DFG, they are still at point F. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves more than just the rectangle? Are there other elements like triangles or other figures? Let me see the given predicates again. There are points A and C, but they are used in RightAngle predicates. For example, RightAngle(Angle(A,G,F)), but since A is a point, not sure how that fits. Wait, the problem mentions that RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)), which would be angle at G between D, G, F. But in the rectangle, that's a right angle. Similarly for others. So maybe points A and C are somewhere else, but the main focus is on the rectangle DEFG.

But returning to the main issue: why does the sum of angles EFD and DFG equal 180? According to the given equations, that's a constraint. So even though in reality, those two angles should add up to 90 degrees, the problem says they add up to 180. Therefore, there must be a different configuration. Perhaps the angles are not adjacent? Or perhaps the diagram isn't a rectangle? But the problem says it is a rectangle.

Wait, maybe the angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle but external? Or maybe they're angles formed by extending lines? For example, if DF is extended beyond F, making some reflex angles? But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not at point F but elsewhere? Wait, noâ€”the notation Angle(E,F,D) implies the angle is at F. So that's fixed. 

Hmm. This seems contradictory. Let me try to proceed algebraically despite this confusion. The problem gives two equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,D)) = 2x - 3  
MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,G)) = x + 12  
Sum of these two measures is 180 degrees.  

So, adding them: (2x -3) + (x +12) = 3x +9 = 180 â†’ 3x = 171 â†’ x=57. Then substituting back, mâˆ EFD = 2*57 -3 = 114 -3 = 111. Wait, but that's not among the options. The options are A.51, B.55, C.67, D.102. So 111 isn't there. So there's a contradiction. Hence, my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait, but maybe the sum is supposed to be 90 instead of 180? If the sum were 90, then 3x+9=90 â†’ 3x=81 â†’ x=27. Then mâˆ EFD = 2*27-3=51, which is option A. But the problem says the sum is 180. So this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not the ones I thought. For example, maybe angle EFD is not the angle inside the rectangle but an exterior angle? Or perhaps the lines DF and EG are not diagonals but something else? Wait, the Line(E,G) is given. In the rectangle, E is connected to G? Wait, in a rectangle, E and G are opposite vertices. So connecting E to G would be a diagonal. Similarly, DF is another diagonal. So diagonals cross at the center. 

But if we consider the angles at point F, which is a corner of the rectangle. The two diagonals DF and EG intersect at some point inside the rectangle. Wait, but point F is a corner, so the diagonal DF starts at D and ends at F. Wait, noâ€”DF connects D to F. So in the rectangle, D is connected to F via a diagonal. So angle EFD is at point F between E and D. So that's the angle between FE and FD. Similarly, angle DFG is at point F between D and G. Which is between FD and FG. So those two angles are adjacent, forming the angle between FE and FG, which is the internal angle at F of the rectangle, which is 90 degrees. Thus, their sum should be 90. But according to the problem, their sum is 180. So there's a contradiction. 

Unless... wait, maybe the angles are not the ones I'm thinking. What if angle EFD is not the internal angle but an external angle? Or maybe the problem considers the reflex angle at point F? For example, if you extend some lines, you might get reflex angles. But that's unusual. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and meant that the sum is 90 degrees. In that case, solving 3x +9=90 gives x=27, leading to mâˆ EFD=51, which is option A. Since none of the other options fit, and assuming that the problem may have a typo, this might be the intended solution. Given that the answer choices don't include 111, but do include 51, which would be the result if the sum was 90, I think that might be the expected answer. 

Therefore, proceeding under the assumption that the sum should be 90 degrees, solving gives x=27, and thus mâˆ EFD=51, which is option A. Even though there's a contradiction in the problem's setup, this is the only way to get an answer matching the choices. Hence, the correct answer is A.
