Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram JKLM. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. 

Looking at the given predicates, there's a lot here. First, the points J, K, L, M form a parallelogram. That means sides JK and LM are parallel and equal, and sides KL and MJ are parallel and equal. Also, the diagonals JL and KM intersect at point R. Wait, but the problem mentions that line JL intersects KM at point R. But since it's a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so R is the midpoint of both diagonals. However, there's also mention of angle bisectors: line JL bisects angle JKM, and line KM bisects angle KLM. Hmm, maybe that's important.

Now, the question is to find the measure of angle JKL. Let me note down the given angles. There's an angle at M-K-L (which I think is angle MKL) measuring 70 degrees, angle K-M-L (which would be angle KML?) measuring 30 degrees, and angle K-L-M (which is angle KLM?) equals 180 minus the sum of the previous two angles. Let me parse that again.

Wait, the predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,K,L)), 70). So angle at K, between points M, K, L. So that's angle MKL = 70 degrees. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)), 30): angle at M, between K, M, L. So that's angle KML = 30 degrees. Then the third angle, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)), Sub(180, Add(MeasureOf(Angle(M,K,L)), MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L))))). So angle at L, between K, L, M. Which would be angle KLM. Let me check if those angles make sense in the context of the parallelogram.

But wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at K should be equal to angle at M, and angle at J equal to angle at L. But here, we have some angles given. Let me try to visualize the parallelogram. Let me label the vertices in order: J, K, L, M. Since it's a parallelogram, sides JK || LM and KL || JM. So the vertices are connected as J-K-L-M-J. 

So angle JKL is the angle at vertex K between points J, K, L. Wait, that's one of the angles of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if we can find another angle, we can subtract from 180. 

But the given angles are angle MKL (at K) which is 70 degrees, angle KML (at M) which is 30 degrees, and angle KLM (at L) which is 180 - (70+30) = 80 degrees. Wait, angle KLM is part of the parallelogram? Let me see. If angle KLM is 80 degrees, then since in a parallelogram opposite angles are equal, angle KLM would be equal to angle JKM? Or maybe angle at J?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider triangle KML. Because angle at K (MKL) is 70°, angle at M (KML) is 30°, so the third angle at L (angle KLM) is 80°, as given. Now, in the parallelogram, angle KLM is one of the internal angles. But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle KLM (which is 80°) and angle JKL (the angle we need to find) are consecutive angles? Wait, no. Let me think about the structure.

In parallelogram JKLM, the angles at K and L are adjacent. Wait, if the vertices are ordered J-K-L-M-J, then angle at K is between J-K-L, and angle at L is between K-L-M. So these are consecutive angles, hence supplementary. Therefore, angle JKL (which is angle at K) plus angle KLM (angle at L) equals 180°. Wait, but according to the given, angle KLM is 80°, so angle JKL would be 180 - 80 = 100°, but none of the options include that. Wait, that contradicts. Maybe my understanding is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the angles mentioned are not the ones directly in the parallelogram. Let me re-examine the angle definitions. The first angle is MeasureOf(Angle(M,K,L)) which is angle at K between M, K, L. So that's angle MKL. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)) is angle at M between K, M, L, which is angle KML. And MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is angle at L between K, L, M, which is angle KLM. So in triangle KML, angles are 70°, 30°, and 80°, adding up to 180°, which checks out. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? Well, in the parallelogram, side KL is parallel to JM, and side ML is parallel to JK. Also, the diagonals intersect at R. Additionally, there are angle bisectors mentioned: line JL bisects angle JKM, and line KM bisects angle KLM. 

Let me consider triangle KML. Since in the parallelogram, KL is one side, and ML is another. Wait, but in the parallelogram, KL is equal to JM, and ML is equal to JK. But the lengths of the sides are given via the LengthOf(Line(J,K)) = 2b + 3, LengthOf(Line(K,L)) = 21, LengthOf(Line(L,M)) = 45, LengthOf(Line(M,J)) = 3a. Also, since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So JK = LM and KL = MJ. So JK = LM = 45? Wait, because LM is Line(L,M) which is length 45. So JK must be equal to LM, which is 45. But the LengthOf(Line(J,K)) is given as 2b + 3. Therefore, 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b=21. Similarly, KL is 21, and MJ should be equal to KL, so MJ = 21. But LengthOf(Line(M,J)) is 3a, so 3a = 21 → a=7. 

So we found that a=7 and b=21. But how does that help with the angles?

Wait, the angles given are in triangle KML. But in the parallelogram, angle at K (JKL) is different from angle MKL (which is 70°). Wait, angle JKL is the angle at K between points J, K, L. But angle MKL is the angle at K between points M, K, L. So angle JKL and angle MKL are adjacent angles at point K. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the angle at K is split into two parts by diagonal JL? Because line JL connects J to L, which is a diagonal. And according to the predicate, line JL bisects angle JKM. Wait, angle JKM is at K, between J, K, M. So if line JL bisects angle JKM, then angle JKL and angle LKM (if such exists) would be equal. 

Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally. At point K, there are several lines: side KJ, side KL, and diagonal KM? Wait, no, the diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, the diagonals of a parallelogram are JL and KM. So diagonal JL connects J to L, and diagonal KM connects K to M. Their intersection is point R. 

But the predicate says BisectsAngle(Line(J,L), Angle(J,K,M)). So line JL bisects angle at K between J, K, M. So angle JKM is being bisected by line JL. Similarly, line KM bisects angle at L between K, L, J. 

So let's focus on angle JKM. At point K, between points J, K, M. This angle is being bisected by line JL. So angle JKM is split into two equal angles by line JL. Similarly, angle at L between K, L, J (angle KLM?) is being bisected by line KM. 

But earlier, we had in triangle KML, angles at K (MKL)=70°, at M (KML)=30°, and at L (KLM)=80°. How do these relate to the angles in the parallelogram?

In the parallelogram, the angle at K (which is angle JKL) is composed of two angles: angle JKM (from the bisector) and angle LKM. Wait, if line JL bisects angle JKM, then angle JKM is split into two equal parts. But angle JKM is part of the larger angle at K. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

At point K, the sides are KJ and KL. The diagonal KM connects K to M. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM. So diagonal KM connects K to M, and diagonal JL connects J to L. So at point K, the lines present are KJ, KL, and KM. Wait, but angle JKL is between KJ and KL. However, the angle JKM is between KJ and KM. So angle JKM is part of the angle JKL. Wait, but how?

Because in the parallelogram, point M is connected to K and L. So line KM is a diagonal. So at point K, the angle between KJ and KM is angle JKM, and the angle between KM and KL is another angle. So angle JKM and angle LKM together make up angle JKL. 

Since line JL bisects angle JKM, then angle JKM is split into two equal angles by line JL. But line JL goes from J to L. So where does line JL meet KM? At point R, which is the intersection of JL and KM. 

But given that in triangle KML, angle at K (MKL) is 70°, which is angle between MK and KL. So angle MKL is 70°, which is part of the parallelogram. 

Let me try to find angle JKL (which is the angle at K between J and L). To find this angle, perhaps we can use the fact that in triangle KML, we know angle MKL is 70°, angle KML is 30°, and angle KLM is 80°. Also, considering the angle bisectors. 

Since line JL bisects angle JKM, let's denote angle JKM as x. Then line JL divides it into two angles of x/2 each. But angle JKL is made up of angle JKM (x) plus angle LKM. Wait, no. Let me think again. 

At point K, the angle JKL is between sides KJ and KL. The diagonal KM splits this angle into two parts: angle JKM and angle LKM. So angle JKL = angle JKM + angle LKM. But line JL bisects angle JKM, so angle JKM is split into two equal parts by line JL. However, without knowing the measures of these angles, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in the parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. For example, angle at K and angle at M are equal. But angle at M in the parallelogram would be angle JMK or something else? Wait, no. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at K (JKL) is equal to angle at M (which is angle JMK?), and angle at J is equal to angle at L. 

But we have some angles given in triangle KML. Let me consider triangle KML. We know angle at K (MKL) is 70°, angle at M (KML) is 30°, and angle at L (KLM) is 80°. 

In the parallelogram, angle at L is angle KLM, which is 80°, so angle at L is 80°, making angle at J also 80°, since opposite angles are equal. Then, since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle at K (which is adjacent to angle at L) would be 180 - 80 = 100°. But that doesn't match any of the answer choices. Wait, but the answer choices are A.60, B.70, C.80, D.90. So 100 isn't there. So maybe my assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe angle KLM is not the same as angle at L in the parallelogram. Wait, angle KLM is part of the parallelogram. Let me think. In the parallelogram, the angles are at each vertex. So angle at L is between points K, L, M. Which is exactly angle KLM. So if angle KLM is 80°, then angle at L is 80°, making angle at K (adjacent) equal to 180 - 80 = 100°, which still isn't among the options. So there must be something wrong with my reasoning. 

Wait, but the given angles in the problem are not necessarily the angles of the parallelogram. They are angles within triangle KML. Let me try to find relations between them. 

In triangle KML, angles are 70°, 30°, and 80°, as previously determined. Now, in the parallelogram, the sides are given. From earlier, we found that side KL has length 21, and side LM has length 45. Since it's a parallelogram, side JK is equal to LM, which is 45. So JK = 45, and KL = 21. Also, side MJ equals KL, which is 21, and side MJ is given as 3a, so a=7. 

Now, applying the Law of Cosines in triangle KML to find the relationship between sides and angles. Wait, in triangle KML, sides KM, ML, and KL. Wait, KL is 21, ML is 45, and KM can be found using the Law of Cosines. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, since we have angles, maybe we can find ratios. 

Alternatively, looking back at the angle bisectors. Since line JL bisects angle JKM, and line KM bisects angle KLM. Let me consider angle JKM. Let’s denote angle JKM as α. Then, since line JL bisects it, each half-angle is α/2. Similarly, angle KLM is 80°, which is being bisected by line KM, so each half-angle is 40°. 

Now, let's consider triangle JKM. Wait, but I don't know much about its sides. Alternatively, look at triangle KJM or others. 

Wait, maybe focusing on the entire parallelogram. The sum of angles around point K. At point K, there are four angles formed by the sides and diagonals. But maybe it's better to consider the angles inside the parallelogram. 

In the parallelogram, the angles at K and L are supplementary. Since angle at L is 80°, angle at K would be 100°, but that's not an option. Wait, unless there's a mistake in assuming angle KLM is 80°. Let me check that again. 

The given measure for angle KLM is Sub(180, Add(MeasureOf(Angle(M,K,L)), MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)))). So angle KLM = 180 - (70 + 30) = 80°. That seems correct. So angle KLM is 80°, which is the angle at L in the parallelogram. Hence, angle at K should be 100°, which isn't an option. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe angle KLM is not the angle at L of the parallelogram. Let me double-check. Angle KLM is the angle at L between points K, L, M. In the parallelogram, the angle at L is between points K, L, M. Yes, that's correct. So angle at L is 80°, leading to angle at K being 100°, which conflicts with the answer choices. Therefore, there must be an alternative approach. 

Perhaps the given angles are not directly the angles of the parallelogram but involve other elements like the diagonals. Let me consider the angle bisectors. 

Since line JL bisects angle JKM, and line KM bisects angle KLM. Let me denote angle JKM as α, and angle KLM as β. Given that angle KLM is 80°, which is β, and it's being bisected by KM. So each part is 40°. 

Also, angle JKM (α) is being bisected by JL into two angles of α/2. 

Now, considering triangle KJM. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, consider triangle KJM and triangle KLM. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So point R is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, the angle bisectors. 

But maybe we can use the fact that in the parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into triangles. For instance, diagonal KM divides the parallelogram into two triangles: KJM and KLM. 

In triangle KLM, we have angles 70°, 30°, and 80°. Now, considering the angle bisectors. 

For angle JKM (which is α), if it's bisected by JL, then in triangle JKM, the bisector JL creates two angles of α/2. Similarly, in triangle KLM, the bisector KM creates two angles of 40° each. 

Wait, but how does this relate to the overall angles of the parallelogram? 

Maybe I need to consider the entire angle at K. The angle at K (angle JKL) consists of angle JKM (α) and angle LKM. Wait, but angle LKM is part of triangle KML, which is 70°, as given. Wait, angle MKL is 70°, which is angle at K between M and L. So that's angle LKM. 

So angle JKL (the total angle at K) is angle JKM (α) + angle LKM (70°). So angle JKL = α + 70°. 

Additionally, since line JL bisects angle JKM, the bisector divides α into two equal parts. 

Now, considering triangle JKM. If we can find α, we can compute angle JKL. 

To find α, maybe we can use the fact that in triangle KML, we have certain side lengths and angles. Let me try applying the Law of Sines in triangle KML. 

In triangle KML, sides are KL = 21, ML = 45, and KM can be computed. Using Law of Sines: 

sin(angle at K)/ML = sin(angle at M)/KL 

So, sin(70°)/45 = sin(30°)/21 

Calculating left side: sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397; 0.9397 / 45 ≈ 0.02088 

Right side: sin(30°) = 0.5; 0.5 / 21 ≈ 0.02381 

These are not equal, indicating inconsistency. Wait, this suggests that the given angles may not correspond to a valid triangle, but the problem states that these are given. Perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the triangle. 

Wait, in triangle KML, the sides would be KM, ML, and KL. Wait, KL is 21, ML is 45. What about KM? It's a diagonal of the parallelogram. Let me calculate KM using the Law of Cosines in triangle KML. 

Using angle at K (70°), sides KL = 21, ML = 45. So:

KM² = KL² + ML² - 2*KL*ML*cos(angle at K)

So KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(70°)

Calculate:

21² = 441, 45² = 2025, so total 441 + 2025 = 2466

Then, 2*21*45 = 1890

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

So KM² = 2466 - 1890 * 0.3420 ≈ 2466 - 646.38 ≈ 1819.62

Thus KM ≈ sqrt(1819.62) ≈ 42.66 units.

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle KML:

sin(70°)/45 = sin(30°)/21 ?

As before, sin(70)/45 ≈ 0.9397/45 ≈ 0.02088

sin(30)/21 = 0.5/21 ≈ 0.02381 

They're not equal, so there's an inconsistency. This suggests that either the problem has inconsistent data, or I've misidentified the triangle. 

Wait, maybe the angle at M in triangle KML is not 30°, but the angle at M is given as 30°, which could be angle KML. Let me confirm. 

Yes, MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)) is 30°, which is angle at M between K, M, L, so yes, angle KML is 30°. So the triangle KML has angles 70° at K, 30° at M, and 80° at L. 

But the Law of Sines gives conflicting results, which suggests that maybe the given lengths are incorrect, but since this is a problem provided, likely I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not KML but another triangle. Let me reconsider. 

Wait, the parallelogram has sides JK=45, KL=21, LM=45, MJ=21. So sides are 45 and 21. Diagonals are JL and KM. 

In a parallelogram, the formula for the diagonals is: 

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. 

Here, a=21, b=45. So:

d1² + d2² = 2*(21² + 45²) = 2*(441 + 2025) = 2*2466 = 4932. 

But I don't know the lengths of the diagonals. However, from triangle KML, we calculated KM ≈ 42.66. Let's call it d1. Then, what about the other diagonal JL? 

But perhaps this is not helpful. 

Back to the angle bisectors. Since line JL bisects angle JKM, and line KM bisects angle KLM. Let's denote angle JKM as α, and angle KLM as β = 80°, so it's bisected into 40° each. 

Now, in the parallelogram, angle at L is β = 80°, so angle at K is 180 - β = 100°, but that leads us back to the earlier contradiction. 

However, since the answer choices don't include 100°, maybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps the angle we're asked is not the whole angle at K, but a portion of it due to the bisector. 

Wait, the question asks for m∠JKL, which is the angle at K between J, K, L. This is the angle of the parallelogram at K. Earlier, we thought it was 100°, but since that's not an option, maybe our assumption about the angles in triangle KML is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at K in triangle KML is not the same as the angle at K in the parallelogram. Let me think. 

In the parallelogram, at point K, there are three lines: KJ, KL, and KM (diagonal). The angle between KJ and KL is angle JKL (which we need to find). The angle between KM and KL is angle LKM = 70° (given). The angle between KJ and KM is angle JKM, which is being bisected by JL. 

So angle JKL = angle JKM + angle LKM = α + 70°, where α is angle JKM. 

Now, if we can find α, we can find angle JKL. 

How to find α? 

Since line JL bisects angle JKM into two equal parts, and line JL is a diagonal of the parallelogram. Also, in the parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so point R is the midpoint of JL and KM. 

But how does this help with finding α? 

Maybe using the angle bisector theorem in triangle JKM. 

In triangle JKM, line JL is the angle bisector of angle JKM, so it divides the opposite side (JM) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. 

Wait, but I don't know the length of JM. Wait, JM is equal to KL, which is 21. So JM = 21. 

But in triangle JKM, side JM is opposite angle K. Wait, no, in triangle JKM, the sides are JK, KM, and JM. 

We know JK = 45, JM = 21, and KM we calculated earlier as approximately 42.66. 

Applying the angle bisector theorem: the angle bisector divides the opposite side into ratio of the adjacent sides. 

So, in triangle JKM, angle bisector JL divides side JM into segments JR and RM (since R is the intersection point of diagonals). Wait, but JL is the bisector, so it meets JM at R? No, JL connects J to L, which is outside of triangle JKM. Wait, this is getting too confusing. 

Alternatively, since R is the intersection of diagonals JL and KM, and diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other. So R is the midpoint of both diagonals. Thus, KR = RM, and JR = RL. 

But how does this relate to the angle bisector? 

Maybe using the property that the angle bisector divides the opposite side proportionally. 

In triangle JKM, if JL is the angle bisector of angle JKM, then it should divide side JM into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. 

Wait, but JL is not connecting to side JM, it's connecting J to L, which is outside of triangle JKM. So this might not apply directly. 

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to consider the entire parallelogram and the given angles. 

Given that angle at L is 80°, and in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, so angle at K should be 100°, but this isn't an option. However, the answer choices are A.60, B.70, C.80, D.90. 

Wait, maybe the angle we are supposed to find is not the full angle at K, but one of the bisected angles? For example, if angle JKM is bisected by JL, and angle JKM is part of the 100°, then maybe the bisected angle relates to the given angles in the triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles in triangle KML are part of the parallelogram's angles. For example, angle MKL = 70°, which is part of angle JKL. If angle JKL is made up of angle MKL (70°) and another angle. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested angle JKL = α + 70°, and if α is something. 

Alternatively, since angle KLM is 80°, and it's bisected by KM into 40°, perhaps using this in relation to other angles. 

In the parallelogram, angle at L is 80°, which is split into two angles of 40° by diagonal KM. So, in triangle KLM, angle at L is 80°, and the bisector KM divides it into 40°. 

Now, considering triangle KLM, with angles 70°, 30°, and 80°, and sides KL=21, ML=45, and KM≈42.66. 

Now, using the Law of Sines in triangle KML:

KL / sin(angle at M) = ML / sin(angle at K) = KM / sin(angle at L)

So:

21 / sin(30°) = 45 / sin(70°) = KM / sin(80°)

Check if this holds. 

First, 21 / 0.5 = 42. 

45 / sin(70°) ≈ 45 / 0.9397 ≈ 47.87. 

These are not equal, so there's inconsistency. This implies that the given angles and sides are not consistent, which can't be true. 

Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. Let me revisit the problem statement. 

Wait, the problem says "Use parallelogram J K L M to find m ∠ J K L." So maybe I misread the labeling of the parallelogram. Could the points be labeled differently? Like, maybe it's a different order? 

Wait, the given Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(L,M), Line(M,J) suggest that the parallelogram is J-K-L-M-J, forming a closed shape. So the order is J, K, L, M, connecting sequentially. 

In that case, the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So opposite sides are JK and LM, KL and MJ. 

So, in this configuration, angle at K is between J, K, L. So angle JKL. 

Now, the given angles are in triangle KML. Let me try to visualize this. Points K, M, L form a triangle, with K connected to M and L. 

In this triangle, angle at K is 70°, at M is 30°, and at L is 80°. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? 

In the parallelogram, side KL is 21, and side LM is 45. So in triangle KML, sides KL=21, LM=45, and KM is a diagonal. 

If we assume that the given angles are correct, even though the Law of Sines doesn't hold, maybe there's a different approach. 

Since the problem involves angle bisectors, perhaps we can use the fact that the angle bisectors divide the angles into certain proportions. 

From earlier, angle JKL = α + 70°, where α is angle JKM. 

Also, since line JL bisects angle JKM, and line JL is a diagonal of the parallelogram. 

In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so R is the midpoint. Also, the diagonals divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. 

But how to connect this to the angle bisectors? 

Maybe using the fact that in triangle JKM, the angle bisector JL divides angle JKM into two equal parts. 

Let me denote angle JKM as α. Then, since JL is the bisector, it splits α into two angles of α/2. 

Now, in triangle JKM, we have sides JK = 45, KM (unknown), and JM = 21. 

By the angle bisector theorem, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. 

Wait, in triangle JKM, the angle bisector from K (wait, no, the angle bisector is from J, or from K? Wait, line JL bisects angle at K (JKM). So the angle bisector is from K, splitting angle JKM into two equal parts. But line JL starts at J and goes to L, which is not part of triangle JKM. This complicates things. 

Alternatively, since JL is the angle bisector of angle JKM, and R is the intersection point of diagonals. 

Maybe using mass point geometry or coordinate geometry? Let me try coordinate geometry. 

Let me place point K at the origin (0,0). Let me define coordinates for the parallelogram. 

Assume point K is at (0,0). Since KL is 21 units long, and let's assume it lies along the x-axis. So point L is at (21,0). 

Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector KL is (21,0). Vector KM needs to be determined. Let me denote point M as (p,q). Since LM is 45 units, and point L is at (21,0), so distance from L to M is 45. So:

(p - 21)^2 + (q - 0)^2 = 45^2 → (p - 21)^2 + q^2 = 2025.

Also, since it's a parallelogram, vector JM should be equal to vector KL. Vector KL is (21,0). Vector JM is M - J. But I need to find coordinates of J. 

Since JK is a side of the parallelogram, and point K is at (0,0). Let me denote point J as (a,b). Then vector JK is K - J = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b). Since vector JM should be equal to vector KL, which is (21,0). So vector JM = vector KL → M - J = (21,0). So M = J + (21,0). 

So if J is (a,b), then M is (a + 21, b). 

Also, point L is at (21,0). So vector KL is (21,0), and vector JM is (21,0). 

Now, we also know that the length of JK is 2b + 3. Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(J,K)) is 2b + 3. But Line(J,K) is from J to K, which is length sqrt((a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²). But the problem says this is equal to 2b + 3. So sqrt(a² + b²) = 2b + 3. Squaring both sides: a² + b² = 4b² + 12b + 9 → a² = 3b² + 12b + 9. 

Also, the length of Line(K,L) is 21, which we already used. 

Now, the length of Line(L,M) is 45. Since point L is at (21,0) and M is at (a + 21, b), the distance LM is sqrt[(a + 21 - 21)^2 + (b - 0)^2] = sqrt[a² + b²]. But this is given as 45, so sqrt(a² + b²) = 45. But earlier, we had sqrt(a² + b²) = 2b + 3. So:

2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b = 21. 

Substituting back, a² = 3*(21)^2 + 12*21 + 9 = 3*441 + 252 + 9 = 1323 + 252 + 9 = 1584. So a = sqrt(1584) = sqrt(16*99) = 4*sqrt(99) = 4*9.949 ≈ 39.796. But exact value is 4√99, but we might not need it. 

Now, point M is at (a + 21, 21). 

Now, we can find coordinates of M: (a + 21, 21). 

Now, let's find the coordinates of point J: (a, 21). 

Now, we need to find angle JKL, which is the angle at K between points J, K, L. 

Point K is at (0,0), J is at (a,21), and L is at (21,0). 

Vector KJ is from K to J: (a,21). Vector KL is from K to L: (21,0). 

The angle between vectors KJ and KL is angle JKL. 

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (KJ · KL) / (|KJ| |KL|).

Compute KJ · KL = (a)(21) + (21)(0) = 21a.

|KJ| = sqrt(a² + 21²) = 45 (since earlier we had sqrt(a² + b²) = 45, and b=21).

|KL| = 21.

So cos(theta) = (21a)/(45 * 21) = a/45.

So theta = arccos(a/45). 

Now, we need to find a. Recall that a² = 1584, so a = sqrt(1584). Let's simplify sqrt(1584):

1584 divided by 16 is 99, so sqrt(16*99) = 4*sqrt(99). So a = 4√99.

Thus, cos(theta) = (4√99)/45.

Now, compute this value. Let's calculate √99 ≈ 9.9499, so 4*9.9499 ≈ 39.7996. Divide by 45: 39.7996 / 45 ≈ 0.8844. 

So theta ≈ arccos(0.8844). Let me calculate this. 

Cos(30°) ≈ 0.8660, cos(25°) ≈ 0.9063. So 0.8844 is between 25° and 30°. Let me find it more precisely. 

Let me calculate arccos(0.8844). Using calculator approximation:

Let me recall that cos(28°) ≈ 0.88296, and cos(27°) ≈ 0.8910. Our value is 0.8844, which is between 27° and 28°. Let me interpolate.

Difference between 27° and 28°: cos decreases by approximately 0.8910 - 0.88296 = 0.00804 per degree. Our target is 0.8844, which is 0.8910 - 0.8844 = 0.0066 less than cos(27°). So fraction = 0.0066 / 0.00804 ≈ 0.82. So angle ≈ 27° + 0.82° ≈ 27.82°, approximately 27.8°. 

But this is not matching any of the answer choices. Wait, this suggests that angle JKL is approximately 27.8°, which is not among the options. This indicates a problem. 

But the given answer choices are A.60, B.70, C.80, D.90. None of these match. Where is the mistake? 

Wait, maybe my assumption about the coordinates is incorrect. Let me check the calculation of a. 

Earlier, we said that sqrt(a² + b²) = 45, and b=21. So a² + 21² = 45² → a² = 45² - 21² = (45-21)(45+21) = 24*66 = 1584. Correct. 

So a = sqrt(1584) = 4√99. 

But why is the angle coming out to be about 27.8°? This doesn't align with the given angles in the problem. 

Wait, but the problem also gives other angles in the triangle KML. Let me use those to find more constraints. 

In triangle KML, we have points K(0,0), L(21,0), and M(a+21,21). Let's compute the angles in this triangle. 

First, compute the lengths of the sides of triangle KML. 

Side KL: from K(0,0) to L(21,0): length 21, as before. 

Side LM: from L(21,0) to M(a+21,21): length sqrt[(a+21 - 21)^2 + (21 - 0)^2] = sqrt(a² + 441). But earlier, we had a² = 1584, so sqrt(1584 + 441) = sqrt(2025) = 45, which matches the given length of LM as 45. 

Side KM: from K(0,0) to M(a+21,21): length sqrt[(a+21)^2 + 21^2]. 

Expand (a+21)^2 + 441 = a² + 42a + 441 + 441 = a² + 42a + 882. 

With a² = 1584, this becomes 1584 + 42a + 882 = 2466 + 42a. 

So length KM = sqrt(2466 + 42a). 

Now, using the given angles in triangle KML: angle at K is 70°, at M is 30°, at L is 80°. 

Let me verify if with these coordinates, the angles match. 

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle KML for angle at K (70°):

cos(70°) = (KL² + KM² - LM²) / (2 * KL * KM)

Wait, no, the Law of Cosines for angle at K is:

cos(angle at K) = (KL² + KM² - LM²) / (2 * KL * KM)

Wait, no, angle at K is between sides KL and KM. So the sides adjacent to angle K are KL and KM, and the opposite side is LM. 

So:

cos(angle at K) = (KL² + KM² - LM²) / (2 * KL * KM)

Plugging in values:

KL = 21, LM = 45, KM = sqrt(2466 + 42a). 

But this seems complex. Let me substitute a = sqrt(1584). 

But this might not be feasible manually. 

Alternatively, let's use the coordinates to calculate the angles. 

Vector at K: from K to L is (21,0), from K to M is (a+21,21). 

The angle between these vectors is angle at K, which should be 70°. 

Compute the cosine of this angle using dot product:

cos(theta) = (KL · KM) / (|KL| |KM|)

KL vector is (21,0), KM vector is (a+21,21). 

Dot product = 21*(a+21) + 0*21 = 21(a + 21).

|KL| = 21, |KM| = sqrt((a+21)^2 + 21^2).

So cos(theta) = [21(a+21)] / [21 * sqrt((a+21)^2 + 441)] = (a+21)/sqrt((a+21)^2 + 441).

This should equal cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420. 

So:

(a + 21)/sqrt((a + 21)^2 + 441) = 0.3420

Let me square both sides:

(a + 21)^2 / [(a + 21)^2 + 441] = 0.1169
