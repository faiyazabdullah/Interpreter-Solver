MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

Starting with the predicates: There's a triangle ABC, and it's equilateral. So all sides are equal, and each angle should be 60 degrees. Points A, B, C are vertices of this triangle. Then there's point D, and line BD is mentioned. Also, collinearity of points B, A, D. Wait, Collinear(Point(B), Point(A), Point(D)) means that points B, A, D lie on a straight line. So D is somewhere along the line BA extended? Or maybe BA itself?

Also, several angles are mentioned. Angles at B, A, and C. Specifically, Angle(C, B, A) would be angle at B between points C, B, A. Similarly, Angle(C, A, B) is angle at A between points C, A, B. And Angle(B, C, A) is angle at C between points B, C, A. 

Then there are congruence relations: Congruent(Angle(C,B,A), Angle(C,A,B)), and Congruent(Angle(C,A,B), Angle(B,C,A)). Since the triangle is equilateral, all angles are 60 degrees, so these congruences make sense. But maybe there's more here. 

Wait, but if ABC is equilateral, all its internal angles are 60°, so each angle in the triangle is 60°. However, the angles mentioned here are different. Let me check again. 

Angle(C, B, A): This is angle at vertex B, formed by points C, B, A. Which is angle ABC. In an equilateral triangle, that's 60°. Similarly, Angle(C, A, B) is angle at A between C, A, B. That's angle BAC, also 60°. And Angle(B, C, A) is angle at C between B, C, A, which is angle ACB, also 60°. So all three angles are congruent, which aligns with the given congruences. 

Now, the question asks to find x. Wait, but where is x defined? Oh, the problem mentions "Find x" but doesn't specify what x represents. Hmm. Maybe there's a missing part in the problem statement? Wait, looking back, perhaps x refers to one of the angles mentioned? Or maybe another angle formed due to the presence of point D?

Wait, the problem includes Line(B,D). Since points B, A, D are collinear, D lies on line BA. Let me visualize this. Let's imagine triangle ABC, equilateral. Point D is on line BA. Depending on where D is, we might have some other angles or triangles. 

But how does this relate to finding x? Perhaps the question is about an angle involving point D? For example, maybe angle CBD or something like that. Alternatively, since there are multiple angles mentioned, maybe x is referring to one of them. But without knowing exactly which angle x represents, it's a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a diagram associated with this problem that isn't included here. Since the user hasn't provided a diagram, I'll have to infer based on standard problems. 

Another thought: Since ABC is equilateral, and D is on line BA, perhaps forming triangle BCD or something. Let's consider that. Suppose D is on BA extended beyond A or beyond B. Let me think. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's assume ABC is an equilateral triangle with AB = BC = CA. Let’s take coordinates for clarity. Let me assign coordinates to make calculations easier. Let’s place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0), and since it's equilateral, point A would be at (0.5, √3/2). Now, line BA goes from B(0,0) to A(0.5, √3/2). Point D is collinear with B and A, so D lies somewhere on line BA. 

Suppose D is such that BD is a line. Wait, the Line(B,D) is given. So D is connected to B, but since B and A are already on line BA, D could be anywhere along that line. 

But how does this affect angles? Let's look for angles involving D. Maybe angle CBD or angle CDB? Let me think. 

Looking back at the angles listed in the predicates: there's Angle(C, B, A) which is angle at B, which is 60°, and others. But maybe there's an angle involving D that's being asked. 

Wait, the problem says "Find x." Since the answer choices are numerical (30, 60, 90, 120), likely x is an angle measure. Given that the triangle is equilateral, and D is on BA, perhaps considering triangle BCD or some other triangle involving D. 

For instance, suppose D is on BA extended beyond A. Then, connecting D to C would form triangle ADC or something. Alternatively, if D is between B and A, then CD might form another triangle. 

But without knowing the exact position of D, how can we determine the angle? Wait, but the collinearity of B, A, D implies that D is on line BA. So, depending on where D is, the configuration changes. 

However, since there are congruences among angles given earlier, maybe we can derive some relations. Let me think again. 

Since ABC is equilateral, all angles are 60°. Now, considering that D is on line BA. Let's assume D is such that BD is a certain length. However, since no lengths are given, maybe the angles formed involve some symmetry. 

Wait, perhaps the key is in the congruence of angles. All the angles mentioned in the predicates are congruent (each 60°). But maybe there's a new angle introduced by point D. Let me think. 

Suppose we look at triangle CBD. If D is on BA, then angle at B could be split. Let me think. If D is on BA, then line BD is just part of BA, so maybe angle CBD is part of the original angle at B. Wait, but angle at B in triangle ABC is 60°, so if D is on BA, then angle CBD would depend on where D is. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves some reflection or construction. Another possibility is that since ABC is equilateral and D is on BA, then CD forms a certain angle. Let me think of possible configurations. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that since ABC is equilateral, and D is on BA, then triangle BCD has some properties. Let me try to calculate angles. 

Assume D is on BA. Let's say D is between B and A. Then BD + DA = BA. If D is beyond A, then BD = BA + AD. But without specific info, perhaps we need to use the given congruences. 

Wait, the congruences between angles are already satisfied because all angles in the triangle are 60°, so they are congruent. But maybe there's another angle created by point D. For example, if we connect D to C, creating triangle BCD. Then, angle at B in triangle BCD would be part of the original angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to an external angle. For example, if D is extended beyond A, then angle CBD would be supplementary to angle ABC. Wait, if D is on the extension of BA beyond A, then angle CBD would be 180° - angle ABC = 180° - 60° = 120°. But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, if D is between B and A, then angle CBD is still part of the original 60° angle. But how does that help us? 

Wait, maybe the answer is 120°, as sometimes in equilateral triangles with extensions, you get supplementary angles. For example, extending BA to D, then angle CBD would be 120°, making x=120. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle BCD, and since ABC is equilateral, BC equals AB. If D is such that BD is a certain length, but without specific lengths, maybe the angles can be determined via triangle properties. 

Wait, but since the problem gives congruences between angles, maybe those are clues. For instance, if two angles are congruent, maybe leading to isosceles triangles. 

Wait, the given congruences are between Angle(C,B,A) ≅ Angle(C,A,B) ≅ Angle(B,C,A). These are the angles of the triangle, which are all 60°, so that checks out. 

But maybe there's another angle involved. Let me think again. 

Since D is on BA, and assuming that line CD is drawn, then looking at triangle BCD. Let's suppose D is such that CD is forming some relationship. 

Alternatively, since there's a line BD, and points B, A, D are colinear, perhaps considering triangle CBD. If we know BC = AB (since ABC is equilateral), and BD is a segment on BA. Let me try assigning variables. 

Let’s denote AB = BC = CA = s. Let’s assume BA is of length s. Let’s say BD = k*s, where k is some scalar. But without knowing k, this seems abstract. 

But maybe there's another way. Since ABC is equilateral, all angles are 60°. If we consider the line BD passing through A, then maybe triangle ABD is something. Wait, but D is on BA, so if D is beyond A, then BD is longer than BA. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about vertical angles or something else. 

Wait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that ABC is equilateral and D is on BA, making triangle BCD. Let's analyze angles in triangle BCD. 

In triangle BCD, we know BC = AB = s. If BD is a certain length, then maybe we can find angles. But without knowing BD's length, how? 

Wait, maybe there's an isosceles triangle involved. For example, if CD equals CB, then triangle CBD would be isosceles. But again, without knowing where D is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the sum of angles around point B. Since ABC is equilateral, angle at B is 60°, and if D is on BA, then angle between BD and BC is... Well, BD is along BA, so angle between BC and BD would be the same as angle between BC and BA, which is angle at B of the triangle, i.e., 60°. 

Wait, that doesn’t seem helpful. 

Hold on, maybe the problem is referring to an angle formed by lines CD and BD? Like, angle at D? Or angle at C? 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 60°, as all angles in the equilateral triangle are 60°, but that seems too straightforward. 

Wait, the answer options include 30, 60, 90, 120. Considering the common angles in equilateral triangles and their extensions. For instance, if you extend a side of an equilateral triangle, you often get 120° angles. 

Let me think: if you have an equilateral triangle ABC, and you extend side BA to a point D, then angle between BC and BD would be 180° - 60° = 120°, because angle at B was originally 60°, and extending BA would create a linear pair with angle ABC. 

So angle CBD would be 120°, making x=120. That fits with answer D. 

But how do we know that D is on the extension of BA beyond A? Because the collinearity of B, A, D implies that D is on line BA, which could be either direction. However, since the problem mentions Line(B,D), which is a separate entity from the sides of the triangle. If D were between B and A, then BD would be part of BA, but maybe the problem considers D outside the triangle. 

Alternatively, if D is between B and A, then angle CBD would be the same as angle ABC, which is 60°, but that would give x=60. But that contradicts unless there's another consideration. 

But since the answer choices include both 60 and 120, and given that in many cases, extending a side leads to supplementary angles, I'm leaning towards 120°. 

Therefore, the answer is likely D. 120.
