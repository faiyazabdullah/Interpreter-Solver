Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P, and several points K, J, N, M, L on it because there are lines from P to each of these points, and they're all radii since they're labeled as IsRadiusOf. That means each of those points is on the circumference of the circle centered at P.

The question is about finding the measure of arc NM, given that the measure of angle MPL is 65 degrees and NP is perpendicular to PL. Let me break this down.

First, since NP is perpendicular to PL, that forms a right angle at point P. Wait, but NP and PL are both radii? Wait, no. Wait, NP is a radius because Line(P,N) is a radius. Similarly, PL is a radius because Line(P,L) is a radius. But if NP and PL are both radii, then they are both emanating from the center P. Wait, but if two radii are perpendicular, then the angle between them would be 90 degrees. But here, NP is perpendicular to PL, so the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees. But since both are radii, that would mean that the angle at P between N and L is 90 degrees. Therefore, the arc NL would be 90 degrees because the central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. Wait, but the problem mentions arc NL, but the question is about arc NM.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says N P ⊥ P L. So that's saying that the line segment NP is perpendicular to PL. Since both NP and PL are radii, that means that the angle at P between N and L is a right angle. Therefore, the central angle ∠NPL is 90 degrees. Which would make arc NL measure 90 degrees. 

But the given information also includes that the measure of angle MPL is 65 degrees. Let me visualize this. Point M is another point on the circle connected to P. So angle MPL is formed at point P, between points M and L. Wait, wait. Wait, angle MPL—so vertex at P, with sides PM and PL. Wait, no. Wait, angle MPL would have vertex at P? No, wait. In standard notation, angle MPL has vertex at P? Wait, no. The middle letter is the vertex. So angle MPL is at point P? Wait, no. Wait, angle MPL would be with vertex at P? Wait, no. Wait, angle at P would be written as ∠MPL, where the middle letter is the vertex. Wait, yes. So angle MPL is ∠MPL, with vertex at P. Wait, but the problem states that m∠MPL = 65°. Wait, but earlier I thought that NP is perpendicular to PL, making ∠NPL = 90°. So maybe there are different angles here.

Let me sketch mentally. Points N, M, L are on the circle with center P. The lines PN, PM, PL are radii. So, the central angles between these points. We know that ∠NPL is 90°, since NP ⊥ PL. Also, ∠MPL is given as 65°. So, if we consider the arcs corresponding to these angles. Since central angles correspond to their arcs, the measure of arc NL is 90°, and the measure of arc ML is 65°, because ∠MPL is the central angle for arc ML. Wait, but how does that relate to arc NM?

We need to find the measure of arc NM. Let me think. The total around the circle is 360°, but since we're dealing with arcs, perhaps we can find the difference between known arcs.

Alternatively, maybe considering the positions of the points. Let's assume that the points are arranged in some order around the circle. For example, starting from N, going through M, then L, and back to N. But without knowing the order, we need to deduce based on the given angles.

Since ∠NPL is 90°, that suggests that points N and L are separated by a quarter-circle. And ∠MPL is 65°, so point M is somewhere such that from P, the angle between PM and PL is 65°. Depending on the direction, this could place M either between N and L or on the other side. However, since there's also an arc NL mentioned (Arc(N,M), Arc(M,L), Arc(L,N), Arc(N,L)), which seems like maybe there's a typo or mislabeling. Wait, the predicates list Arc(N,M), Arc(M,L), Arc(L,N), and Arc(N,L). Wait, that might indicate that the arcs are part of a triangle or something else. Maybe the arcs are parts of the circle connecting N-M-L-N, forming a triangle? Or perhaps the arcs are named in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe the arcs listed are indicating that the circle is divided into three arcs: NM, ML, LN, and also NL. Wait, but that would imply overlapping arcs. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the arcs are meant to form a closed loop, so Arc(N,M), Arc(M,L), Arc(L,N) would make up the entire circle. But there's also Arc(N,L), which would be equivalent to Arc(N,M) + Arc(M,L). Unless there's more structure.

But regardless, the main thing is that we need to find the measure of arc NM. Given that ∠NPL is 90°, which corresponds to arc NL being 90°, and ∠MPL is 65°, which corresponds to arc ML being 65°. Then, depending on the position of M relative to N and L, we can compute arc NM.

Assuming that the points are ordered N, M, L around the circle. Then, arc NL would be arc NM plus arc ML. So arc NL = arc NM + arc ML. Since arc NL is 90°, and arc ML is 65°, then arc NM would be 90° - 65° = 25°. So that would make arc NM measure 25°, which would be answer A.

But let me check again. Suppose that the angle ∠MPL is 65°, which is the central angle between points M and L, so arc ML is 65°. Then, since arc NL is 90°, then if points N, M, L are placed in order around the circle, then arc NM would be arc NL minus arc ML, which is 90° - 65° = 25°, hence answer A. 

But another possibility is that point M is located such that the central angle ∠MPL is 65°, which could be in the opposite direction. For instance, if moving from P, the angle between PM and PL is 65°, but depending on the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), arc ML could be 65° or 360° - 65°, but since arcs are typically considered as the smaller one unless specified otherwise. However, since arc NL is 90°, which is already a quarter-circle, and arc ML is 65°, which is less than 90°, so adding them gives 155°, which would leave the remaining arc as 360° - 155° - arc MN. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that N, L, and M are positioned with N and L separated by 90°, and M is somewhere else. But since angle MPL is 65°, that could mean that M is closer to L than to N. So, the arc from M to L is 65°, and the arc from N to L is 90°, so the arc from N to M would be 90° - 65° = 25°, which is answer A.

Therefore, the measure of arc NM should be 25°, so the answer is A.
