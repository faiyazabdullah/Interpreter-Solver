MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points G, H, J, K, and L. There's a circle with center L. Then there are two lines: Line(G,H) and Line(J,K). Both of these lines are chords of the circle centered at L. Also, it's stated that Line(G,H) is congruent to Line(J,K). So those two chords are congruent in length.

Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(G,H,J) and Angle(G,K,J). Their measures are given as 83 degrees and 2x - 27 degrees respectively. Additionally, it's said that the measure of Angle(G,H,J) equals the measure of Angle(G,K,J). 

Wait, so the first thing I notice is that since the two chords are congruent, maybe there's something about the angles subtended by them? But wait, the angles here aren't necessarily central angles or inscribed angles. Let me think.

But the angles mentioned are Angle(G,H,J) and Angle(G,K,J). Let me visualize this. For Angle(G,H,J), the vertex is at point H, with segments HG and HJ. Wait, no—angle notation is usually the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(G,H,J) would have vertex at H, with sides going to G and J. Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) has vertex at J, with sides going to G and K. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are formed by intersecting lines. Since we have two chords GH and JK, but also points connected to form angles. Wait, maybe the lines GH and JK are chords of the circle, and points G, H, J, K are arranged such that these angles are formed.

Another thought: since GH and JK are congruent chords in the same circle, they must subtend arcs of equal measure. However, the angles given here might be related to the arcs. But the angles mentioned are not necessarily central angles. Wait, if the angles are inscribed angles, then their measures would be half the measure of their intercepted arcs. Alternatively, if they're central angles, they'd equal the arc measure.

But the problem mentions Angle(G,H,J) and Angle(G,K,J). Let me try to figure out where these angles are located. Let's take Angle(G,H,J): points G, H, J. So vertex at H, with segments H-G and H-J. Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) has vertex at J, with segments J-G and J-K. 

Hmm. So maybe these angles are part of some triangles. Let me consider triangle GHJ and triangle GKJ? Or maybe triangle GJK?

Alternatively, since GH and JK are chords of the circle, and points G, H, J, K are on the circle? Wait, but the circle is defined by point L. Are the points G, H, J, K on the circle? Well, since the lines GH and JK are chords of the circle, that means points G, H, J, K lie on the circle. Because a chord connects two points on a circle. Therefore, points G, H, J, K are all on the circle centered at L.

So, the circle has center L, and points G, H, J, K are on its circumference. Thus, GH and JK are chords of the circle, and they are congruent. 

Now, the angles mentioned: Angle(G,H,J) and Angle(G,K,J). Let me think again about their locations. For Angle(G,H,J), vertex at H, so points G-H-J. That would be an angle formed by connecting G to H to J. Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) is vertex at J, so points G-J-K. So that's an angle formed by connecting G to J to K.

Since all four points G, H, J, K are on the circle, maybe these angles are inscribed angles intercepting certain arcs. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

Let me analyze Angle(G,H,J). This angle is at point H, with segments HG and HJ. So, the intercepted arc would be arc GJ. Wait, because the inscribed angle intercepts the arc opposite the angle. So, the angle at H intercepts arc GJ. Therefore, the measure of Angle(G,H,J) would be half the measure of arc GJ. 

Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) is at point J, with segments JG and JK. So that angle intercepts arc GK. Therefore, the measure of Angle(G,K,J) would be half the measure of arc GK. 

Given that, we know that Angle(G,H,J) = 83°, and Angle(G,K,J) = 2x - 27°, and they are equal. So setting them equal gives us 83 = 2x - 27. Solving for x would give x = (83 + 27)/2 = 110/2 = 55. But wait, that seems straightforward. But why are the chords GH and JK congruent? Is there another condition here?

Wait, but hold on. If GH and JK are congruent chords in the circle, then their intercepted arcs must be congruent. Since the chords are congruent, their corresponding arcs are congruent. So arc GH ≅ arc JK. But earlier, I thought that Angle(G,H,J) intercepts arc GJ, and Angle(G,K,J) intercepts arc GK. But if arcs GH and JK are congruent, does that affect the intercepted arcs?

Wait, maybe my initial assumption about which arcs are intercepted is incorrect. Let me re-examine the intercepted arcs for the angles.

For Angle(G,H,J): vertex at H, so the angle is formed by points G-H-J. In the circle, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite the angle, which would be arc GJ that doesn't contain H. Similarly, for Angle(G,K,J): vertex at J, formed by points G-J-K, so the intercepted arc would be arc GK that doesn't contain J. 

However, since GH and JK are congruent chords, their arcs GH and JK are congruent. Therefore, arc GH ≅ arc JK. Now, considering the entire circle, the sum of all arcs is 360°. But how do these arcs relate to the intercepted arcs for the angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship here. Let me think again. Suppose that the chords GH and JK are congruent, so arc GH ≅ arc JK. Then, the arcs between G and H, and between J and K are equal. But how does this relate to the intercepted arcs of the angles in question?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the measure of the angles in terms of the arcs. Let me try again.

For Angle(G,H,J): this is an inscribed angle intercepting arc GJ. So measure of Angle(G,H,J) = ½ * measure(arc GJ).

Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) intercepts arc GK. So measure of Angle(G,K,J) = ½ * measure(arc GK).

But we also know that chords GH and JK are congruent, hence arc GH ≅ arc JK. So measure(arc GH) = measure(arc JK).

But how do these arcs relate to arc GJ and arc GK?

Let me consider the full circle. Let me denote:

arc GH = arc JK = a (since chords GH and JK are congruent)

Also, arc GJ and arc GK depend on the positions of the points. Let me imagine the circle with points G, H, J, K placed around it. Since GH and JK are chords, their arcs are a. Let me try to find expressions for arc GJ and arc GK.

Assuming the order of points on the circle is G, H, J, K, but that may not be accurate. Alternatively, depending on how the points are arranged, the arcs could vary. But without knowing the exact arrangement, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are related through triangle properties. Let me consider triangles involved. For example, Triangle GHJ and Triangle GKJ. Wait, but I don't know much about the sides of these triangles yet.

Wait, but we know that GH ≅ JK. And maybe some angles? Wait, the angles given are Angle(G,H,J) and Angle(G,K,J). Which are angles at different vertices.

Alternatively, since GH and JK are congruent chords, and assuming that the circle is symmetric, maybe there's some symmetry in the angles. However, the angles given are 83° and 2x-27°, which are set equal. So equating them directly would lead to x=55. But maybe there's more to it?

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the angles are inscribed angles intercepting arcs GJ and GK. Let me double-check that.

In Angle(G,H,J): vertex at H, so the inscribed angle would intercept the arc that is opposite to H, i.e., the arc between G and J that does not pass through H. Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) intercepts the arc between G and K that does not pass through J.

But if the points are arranged such that moving around the circle, the order is G, H, J, K, then arc GJ would be arc from G to J passing through H, and the other arc would be the shorter one. However, since GH and JK are chords, the arcs GH and JK are fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of arc GJ can be expressed in terms of arc GH and arc HJ, and similarly for arc GK. But without knowing the exact configuration, this might be complicated.

Wait, but since GH and JK are congruent chords, their arcs are congruent. Let me denote arc GH = arc JK = α. Then, suppose that arc HJ = β and arc K... Wait, maybe I'm getting too bogged down.

Alternatively, since the angles are equal, and they correspond to intercepted arcs, then:

measure(angle G,H,J) = ½ * measure(arc GJ) = 83°

measure(angle G,K,J) = ½ * measure(arc GK) = 2x - 27°

And since angle measures are equal, then ½ * arc GJ = ½ * arc GK → arc GJ = arc GK. Hence, arc GJ = arc GK. 

Therefore, arc GJ equals arc GK. 

But how does that relate to the other arcs?

Since arc GH = arc JK (because chords GH and JK are congruent), then maybe we can find relations between arcs.

Let me assume that the total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs is 360°. But without knowing the exact positions of the points, it's hard to say. However, if arc GJ = arc GK, then perhaps there's a way to relate the arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved where these arcs play a role. For instance, if we look at triangle GJK and triangle GHJ, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe the fact that arc GJ equals arc GK implies that the chords GJ and GK are congruent? Because congruent arcs imply congruent chords. So if arc GJ equals arc GK, then chords GJ and GK are congruent. 

But how does that help us? 

Alternatively, maybe looking back at the angles: since arc GJ = arc GK, and angle measures are half the arcs. But since we already used that to set up the equation, maybe there's another relation.

Wait, but if arc GJ equals arc GK, then the chords GJ and GK are congruent. So triangle GJK has two congruent sides: GJ and GK. So triangle GJK is isoceles with base JK and legs GJ and GK. Wait, but I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the angles and the chords. Wait, but the problem asks for x, and according to the equation 83 = 2x -27, solving for x gives x=(83+27)/2=110/2=55. Which is option C. 

But why is that acceptable? Because the problem states that the measure of angle G,H,J equals the measure of angle G,K,J. So regardless of the rest, setting them equal gives 83 = 2x-27, leading to x=55. But is there any reason this wouldn't be valid?

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. What if the angles are not inscribed angles? For example, if the angles are not inscribed, then their measures wouldn't be half the arcs. But how can we confirm that?

Let me reconsider the nature of the angles. Angle(G,H,J) is formed by points G, H, J. Since all points are on the circle, this angle is indeed an inscribed angle intercepting arc GJ. Similarly, Angle(G,K,J) intercepts arc GK. So the previous reasoning holds. Therefore, their measures are half the respective arcs. Since the angles are equal, the arcs are equal, leading to the equation 83 = 2x-27. 

Thus, solving that equation gives x=55, which is option C. 

But let me check if there's another constraint. The problem says that GH and JK are congruent chords. Does that affect anything? Since they are congruent, their arcs are congruent, but that's already considered in our previous reasoning. 

Therefore, unless there's an error in assuming the angles are inscribed angles, the answer would be 55. 

But wait, another possibility: maybe the angles are not inscribed angles but instead something else. For example, if the vertex is not on the circumference. But in this case, the vertex H and J are points on the circle. So angles at H and J are inscribed angles. 

Hence, the calculation seems valid. Therefore, x=55 corresponds to answer choice C.
