MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

So, we have a triangle ABC. The points A, B, and C are defined, and there are lines AB, BC, and AC forming the sides of the triangle. Also, there's an angle at BAC (Angle(B,A,C)) which is given as 60 degrees. Additionally, it's stated that triangle ABC is a right triangle, specifically, the hypotenuse is AC because Line(A,C) is the hypotenuse. 

Wait, the Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) predicate means it's a right triangle. Then IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) tells us that the hypotenuse is AC. So, the right angle must be at point B since the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Therefore, angle at B is 90 degrees. But wait, another angle is given as Angle(B,A,C) which is 60 degrees. Wait, Angle(B,A,C) would be angle at A? Let me clarify the notation. In Angle(X,Y,Z), the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. Similarly, Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A between points B and C. 

Given that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)), 60). So angle at A is 60 degrees. And since the triangle is right-angled, the sum of angles should be 180. So if angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°, then angle at C would be 30°, because 60 + 90 + 30 = 180. That makes sense. So triangle ABC has angles 60°, 90°, 30°, making it a 30-60-90 triangle. 

Now, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60° is √3 times longer, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side. 

But first, let's figure out which sides correspond to which angles. Since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse is AC (as given). Therefore, the sides adjacent to the right angle are AB and BC, and AC is the hypotenuse. 

So angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Because in triangle ABC, angle at A is between AB and AC. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Let me think again. 

In triangle ABC, with right angle at B, so sides AB and BC are legs, and AC is hypotenuse. Then angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Therefore, BC is opposite 60°, and AB is opposite angle C, which is 30°. 

Therefore, in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, 90° are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So here, AB is opposite angle C (which is 30°), so AB corresponds to the shorter leg. BC is opposite angle A (60°), so it's the longer leg. Hypotenuse AC is twice the shorter leg. 

We're told that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 16√3. Wait, but according to the ratios, AB is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), so AB = x, BC = x√3, AC = 2x. However, the given length of AB is 16√3. So substituting, x = 16√3. Then BC would be x√3 = 16√3 * √3 = 16*3 = 48. But wait, there's another equation given: Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B))). Let me check that. 

The predicate says Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))) equals LengthOf(Line(A,B)). So sqrt(3)*BC = AB. But according to our earlier assumption, AB is the shorter leg, and BC is the longer leg. Which would mean BC = AB / sqrt(3). Wait, that contradicts the previous thought. Hmm, something's wrong here. 

Let me re-examine. If angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite angle A (which is BC) should be longer than AB. Wait, but the given equation is that sqrt(3) multiplied by BC equals AB. So sqrt(3)*BC = AB → BC = AB / sqrt(3). That suggests that BC is shorter than AB. But according to the angles, angle at A is 60°, so BC is opposite angle A, which would make BC the longer leg. So perhaps my initial assignment of which side is which was incorrect. 

Wait, maybe I mixed up the angles. Let me get back. 

Since the triangle is right-angled at B, the right angle is at B. So angles at A and C are complementary. Given that angle at A is 60°, then angle at C is 30°. 

So, angle at A (60°): the side opposite is BC. Angle at C (30°): the side opposite is AB. Therefore, AB is opposite 30°, BC is opposite 60°, and AC is hypotenuse. 

Thus, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are: 

- Opposite 30° (AB): shortest side, length x 
- Opposite 60° (BC): longer leg, length x√3 
- Hypotenuse (AC): 2x 

But according to the given, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 16√3. So AB = 16√3. Therefore, x = 16√3. Then BC = x√3 = 16√3 * √3 = 16*3 = 48. Then AC = 2x = 32√3. 

However, the other predicate says that Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))) equals LengthOf(Line(A,B)). So sqrt(3)*BC = AB. Substituting BC = 48 and AB = 16√3: sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3, which is not equal to 16√3. This contradicts the given condition. Hence, there's a mistake in my assumptions. 

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check again. Maybe the angle assignments are different. Perhaps the right angle isn't at B? Wait, the hypotenuse is AC, so the right angle must be at B. Because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if AC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle is at B. So that part is correct. 

Then angle at A is 60°, so BC is opposite angle A. So BC = x√3. AB is opposite angle C (30°), so AB = x. But according to the given, AB is 16√3. So x = 16√3. Then BC = x√3 = 16√3 * √3 = 48. Then the equation sqrt(3)*BC = AB becomes sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3, which is not equal to 16√3. Therefore, contradiction. 

This implies that my initial assumption about which side is which is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps angle at A is not 60°, but angle at B? No, the given angle is Angle(B,A,C), which is angle at A. 

Wait, maybe the triangle isn't labeled correctly. Let me double-check the angle notation. 

Angle(B,A,C) refers to the angle at point A between points B and C. So yes, angle at A is 60°, which is consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle isn't a standard 30-60-90 triangle? But with angles 60°, 90°, and 30°, it must be. So why does the given equation not hold?

Wait, the given equation says that Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))) equals LengthOf(Line(A,B)). Let me write that down: sqrt(3) * BC = AB. 

From earlier, we had BC = AB / sqrt(3). But according to the standard ratios, BC should be AB * sqrt(3). So there's a conflict here. 

Ah! Here's the mistake. If angle at A is 60°, then BC is opposite angle A, so BC is the longer leg. Therefore, BC = AB * tan(60°). Since tan(60°) = sqrt(3), so BC = AB * sqrt(3). Therefore, BC = 16√3 * sqrt(3) = 16*3 = 48. 

But according to the given equation, sqrt(3)*BC = AB. Substituting BC=48 gives sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3, which should equal AB. But AB is given as 16√3. 48√3 ≠ 16√3. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, there's inconsistency unless my understanding of the triangle is wrong. 

Wait, maybe angle at A is not 60°, but angle at B? No, the given angle is Angle(B,A,C) which is angle at A. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle isn't right-angled at B? But the hypotenuse is AC, so the right angle must be at B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is different. Let me recheck the predicate: Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B))). So sqrt(3) multiplied by BC equals AB. 

So sqrt(3)*BC = AB → BC = AB / sqrt(3). 

Which would imply that BC is shorter than AB. But if angle at A is 60°, then BC is longer than AB. So this seems conflicting. 

Wait, maybe angle at A is not 60°, but angle at B? No, the given angle is at A. 

Wait, could the triangle be labeled differently? For example, maybe the right angle is at C instead? No, because the hypotenuse is AC, which is opposite the right angle. So if the hypotenuse is AC, then the right angle is at B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at A is 60°, but the triangle is not a 30-60-90 triangle? How? Because angles are 60°, 90°, and 30°, which adds up to 180. 

So there's a contradiction here. Let me try to resolve this. 

Let me denote the sides:

Let’s call AB = c, BC = a, AC = b. Wait, in standard notation, usually, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, etc. But maybe better to use variables for clarity. 

Let me define:

Let’s denote:

- AB = c (from point A to B)

- BC = a (from B to C)

- AC = b (hypotenuse)

Since the right angle is at B, then by Pythagoras: AB² + BC² = AC². 

Also, angles: At A is 60°, at B is 90°, at C is 30°. 

Using trigonometry:

tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = BC / AB = tan(60°) = √3. 

Therefore, BC / AB = √3 → BC = AB * √3. 

Given that AB = 16√3, then BC = 16√3 * √3 = 16*3 = 48. 

Then, according to the given equation: sqrt(3) * BC = AB → sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3, which is supposed to equal AB (16√3). But 48√3 ≠ 16√3. So this doesn't hold. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, but the problem states that Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B))). So sqrt(3)*BC = AB. According to this, BC = AB / sqrt(3). 

But from the angle relations, BC = AB * sqrt(3). 

These two conditions contradict each other unless AB = 0, which is impossible. 

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the angle assignments. 

Wait, let me re-express the angle. The given angle is Angle(B,A,C), which is the angle at A between BA and CA. So angle at A is between BA and CA, which is indeed angle BAC. 

So angle at A is 60°, which makes BC the side opposite angle A. 

But if BC = AB / sqrt(3), then BC < AB, which would mean that angle at A is less than 45°, but it's given as 60°. Contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the triangle isn't a right triangle? But it's stated as Right(Triangle(A,B,C)). 

Wait, perhaps the angle at A is 60°, but the right angle is not at B? How? If the hypotenuse is AC, then the right angle must be at B. Otherwise, the hypotenuse would be the longest side, which is AC. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at B, but at C or A? Let me check. 

Suppose the right angle is at C. Then hypotenuse would be AB. But the given predicate says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)), so hypotenuse is AC. Thus, the right angle must be at B. 

Hmm. So how to reconcile the given equation with the angle relations? 

Let me consider that maybe the angle at A is not 60°, but something else? Wait, the given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)), 60). So angle at A is 60°, so that's fixed. 

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the relation between the sides. Let me derive it properly. 

Let’s denote:

- AB = c = 16√3 

- BC = a 

- AC = b 

Angles:

At A: 60°, at B: 90°, at C: 30°. 

Using Law of Sines: 

a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)

Wait, angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°, angle at C is 30°. 

So:

a / sin(60°) = b / sin(90°) = c / sin(30°)

Compute these ratios:

sin(60°) = √3/2, sin(90°)=1, sin(30°)=1/2.

So,

a / (√3/2) = b / 1 = c / (1/2)

Which simplifies to:

a / (√3/2) = b = 2c

So:

b = 2c → AC = 2*AB

And also, a = (√3/2) * b = (√3/2)*(2c) = √3*c

So BC = √3 * AB. 

But given AB = 16√3, then BC = √3*(16√3) = 16*3 = 48. 

But the given equation says that sqrt(3)*BC = AB → sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3 = AB. But AB is given as 16√3. So 48√3 ≠ 16√3. Contradiction. 

This indicates that there's an inconsistency in the given predicates. Unless I made a mistake in interpreting the angle or the sides. 

Wait, maybe the angle at A is not 60°, but the angle at B? Let me recheck the predicate. 

The angle is Angle(B,A,C), which is angle at A. So it's definitely angle at A. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is different? Let me re-read the predicate:

"Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B)))"

So sqrt(3) multiplied by BC equals AB. 

So sqrt(3)*BC = AB → BC = AB / sqrt(3). 

But from the Law of Sines, BC = sqrt(3)*AB. 

Thus, combining these equations:

sqrt(3)*BC = AB  
and  
BC = sqrt(3)*AB  

Substitute BC from second equation into first:  
sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)*AB) = AB → 3*AB = AB → 3AB = AB → 2AB = 0 → AB = 0. Impossible. 

Contradiction. So either the problem has inconsistent data, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not at A, but elsewhere? Let me check again. 

Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A. Yes. 

Another possibility: the triangle is not a right triangle? But it's stated as Right(Triangle(A,B,C)). 

Wait, maybe the given angle is not part of the triangle? No, the Angle(B,A,C) is part of the triangle. 

This is perplexing. There must be an error in my interpretation of the predicates. Let me re-examine them. 

The given predicates are:

- Triangle(A,B,C) 

- Point(A), Point(B), Point(C) 

- Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,C) 

- Angle(A,B,C) — this is angle at B between A and C 

- Angle(B,A,C) — angle at A between B and C 

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) — so angle at B is right angle 

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)), 60) — angle at A is 60° 

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 16*sqrt(3)) — AB = 16√3 

- Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) — confirms right triangle at B 

- IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)) — AB is a side 

- IsSideOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) — BC is a side 

- IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) — AC is hypotenuse 

- Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B))) — sqrt(3)*BC = AB 

So all these are given. 

So the problem is to find y, which is likely BC or AC or something else. Wait, the question says "Find y." But y isn't mentioned in the predicates. Wait, maybe y is referring to BC? Or maybe it's a typo, and they meant to ask for BC or AC? Or perhaps the problem has a missing part? 

Wait, looking back at the original question: the user says "Find y." But none of the predicates mention y. This is confusing. Wait, perhaps there's a missing part in the problem description? Or maybe y is referring to BC? 

Assuming that y is BC, since the options are numerical values. Let me proceed under that assumption. 

But given the contradiction in the equations, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the triangle. 

Alternative approach: forget about the standard 30-60-90 ratios and use the given equations directly. 

Let me denote:

Let AB = 16√3 (given).

Let BC = x.

Given that sqrt(3)*x = AB → sqrt(3)*x = 16√3 → x = 16. 

So BC = 16. 

But then, using the right triangle with AB=16√3, BC=16, hypotenuse AC. 

By Pythagoras: AC² = AB² + BC² = (16√3)^2 + 16^2 = 16² * 3 + 16² = 16² (3+1) = 16² * 4 → AC = 16*2 = 32. 

Now, let's check the angles. In triangle ABC, right-angled at B. So angle at A is arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(BC/AB) = arctan(16/(16√3)) = arctan(1/√3) = 30°. But the given angle at A is 60°. Contradiction again. 

Wait, this suggests that angle at A is 30°, but it's given as 60°. So this is conflicting. 

But according to the given angle measure, angle at A is 60°, but with BC=16 and AB=16√3, it's 30°. 

So there's a contradiction. What's the resolution? 

Perhaps the angle at A is 60°, and the triangle is not right-angled at B? But the hypotenuse is AC, implying right angle at B. 

Alternatively, maybe the given equation is not involving BC but another side? 

Wait, the given equation is Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), which is sqrt(3)*BC = AB. So BC = AB / sqrt(3). 

With AB=16√3, BC=16√3 / sqrt(3) = 16. 

So BC=16. 

Then, using Pythagoras: AC = sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt((16√3)^2 + 16^2) = sqrt(768 + 256) = sqrt(1024) = 32. 

Now, in this case, angle at A is arctan(BC/AB) = arctan(16/(16√3)) = arctan(1/√3) = 30°, but the given angle at A is 60°. So discrepancy. 

But the given angle at A is 60°, so this suggests that the triangle is not right-angled at B, but somewhere else. Wait, but hypotenuse is AC, so right angle must be at B. 

This is very confusing. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the angle at A is not between AB and AC, but between BA and CA? No, that's the same thing. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is labeled incorrectly? Like, maybe the right angle is at C? Let me try that. 

If the right angle is at C, then hypotenuse is AB. But the given predicate says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)), so hypotenuse is AC. So right angle cannot be at C. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at A, then hypotenuse would be BC. But the given hypotenuse is AC. So no. 

This suggests that the problem's given predicates are inconsistent, leading to contradictions. 

But since this is a problem to solve, there must be a way. Perhaps I misapplied the angle relations. 

Let me try using coordinates to model this. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0), since it's the right angle. Let me assume AB is along the x-axis, and BC along the y-axis. 

So, let's say:

- Point B is at (0,0)

- Point A is at (c, 0), since AB is horizontal.

- Point C is at (0, d), since BC is vertical.

Then, AC is the hypotenuse from (c,0) to (0,d). 

Angle at A is the angle between AB (from A to B) and AC (from A to C). 

Let me calculate this angle. 

Vector AB is from A to B: (-c, 0)

Vector AC is from A to C: (-c, d)

The angle at A is between vectors AB and AC. 

The tangent of angle at A is the slope of AC relative to AB. 

But more precisely, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, where theta is the angle at A. 

Alternatively, using coordinates, the angle at A can be found via dot product. 

But maybe easier to compute using slopes. 

The line AC goes from A(c,0) to C(0,d). The slope of AC is (d-0)/(0-c) = -d/c. 

The angle at A is between AB (horizontal line) and AC. So the angle between AB (along negative x-axis from A) and AC (going to C). 

The angle theta at A satisfies tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = (vertical change)/(horizontal change). 

But since AC goes from A to C, which is left and up. From point A, moving to C involves going left (negative x) and up (positive y). 

So the angle at A is formed between AB (left along x-axis) and AC (up-left diagonal). 

The tangent of this angle would be the rise over run, which is d/c. 

Because from A, moving to C, the vertical change is d (up) and horizontal change is -c (left). So the slope is -d/c, but the angle's tangent is d/c. 

So tan(theta) = d/c. 

Given that angle at A is 60°, so tan(theta) = tan(60°) = √3. 

Therefore, d/c = √3 → d = c√3. 

So BC is the length from B(0,0) to C(0,d) = d = c√3. 

AB is the length from A(c,0) to B(0,0) = c. 

Given that AB = 16√3, so c = 16√3. 

Then BC = d = c√3 = 16√3 * √3 = 16*3 = 48. 

Then AC is the hypotenuse, distance from A(c,0) to C(0,d):

AC = sqrt((c)^2 + (d)^2) = sqrt((16√3)^2 + (48)^2) = sqrt(768 + 2304) = sqrt(3072) = sqrt(1024*3) = 32√3. 

Now, let's check the given equation: sqrt(3)*BC = AB ?

BC = 48, AB = 16√3. 

sqrt(3)*48 = 48√3, which is not equal to AB = 16√3. So this contradicts the given equation. 

But the problem states that Equals(Mul(sqrt(3), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), LengthOf(Line(A,B))). So sqrt(3)*BC = AB. 

According to this, BC = AB / sqrt(3) = 16√3 / sqrt(3) = 16. 

So BC = 16. 

But from angle at A being 60°, we have d/c = √3 → d = c√3. With AB = c = 16√3, then d = 16√3 * √3 = 48. So BC = d = 48. 

Conflict. 

But the given equation requires BC = 16. 

So, to satisfy both conditions: angle at A is 60° and sqrt(3)*BC = AB, we need to have both:

1. d/c = √3 → d = c√3 

2. sqrt(3)*d = c → d = c / sqrt(3)

Combining these two equations: 

From 1: d = c√3 

From 2: d = c / sqrt(3)

Setting equal: c√3 = c / sqrt(3) → √3 = 1/sqrt(3) → 3 = 1 → contradiction. 

Thus, the given conditions are contradictory. 

Unless there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the angle at A is not 60°, but the angle at B is 60°? No, the given angle is Angle(B,A,C), which is at A. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I've misread something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle given is not the internal angle, but some other measurement? 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not Euclidean? Unlikely. 

Wait, let me think outside the box. Suppose that the given equation is correct, and the angle at A is 60°, and see what happens. 

Given that sqrt(3)*BC = AB → BC = AB / sqrt(3) = 16√3 / sqrt(3) = 16. 

So BC = 16. 

Now, with AB = 16√3, BC = 16, right-angled at B. 

Then AC = sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt((16√3)^2 + 16^2) = sqrt(768 + 256) = sqrt(1024) = 32. 

Now, angle at A is computed as tan(theta) = BC / AB = 16 / (16√3) = 1/√3 → theta = 30°. 

But the given angle at A is 60°. Contradiction again. 

So, the only way for angle at A to be 60° is if BC = AB * √3. But that conflicts with the given equation. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup. But since this is a problem to solve, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, could the angle at A be 60°, and the triangle not be right-angled at B? But the hypotenuse is AC, which implies right angle at B. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at B, but the hypotenuse is AC, which would require the right angle to be at B. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the answer choices and see which one fits. 

The options are: A. 8√2, B. 8√3, C. 16, D. 24. 

If I ignore the angle condition and focus on the equation sqrt(3)*BC = AB, with AB=16√3, then BC = 16. So BC = 16, which is option C. 

But this ignores the angle condition. However, if the problem expects us to prioritize the equation over the angle, then BC=16. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at A is 60°, and the equation is a red herring, or there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at A is 60°, and the triangle is not right-angled at B, but at C? Let me try that. 

If the right angle is at C, then hypotenuse is AB. But the given hypotenuse is AC, so this is not possible. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at A, then hypotenuse is BC. But given hypotenuse is AC, so no. 

This seems like a dead end. 

But considering the answer choices, and assuming that the equation sqrt(3)*BC = AB is correct, and ignoring the angle condition (maybe a misprint), then BC = 16, which is option C. 

But the angle condition is crucial. Alternatively, maybe the question asks for AC? Let me see. 

If AB = 16√3, BC = 16, then AC = 32. Which is not among the options. 

Wait, option D is 24. 

Alternatively, if we take BC = 16, and the angle at A is 60°, then using the Law of Cosines: 

In triangle ABC, with AB = 16√3, BC = 16, and angle at A = 60°. 

Law of Cosines: BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle at A). 

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines. 

With angle at A = 60°, angle at B = 90°, angle at C = 30°. 

So, BC / sin(60°) = AB / sin(30°). 

So BC = AB * sin(60°) / sin(30°) = 16√3 * (√3/2) / (1/2) = 16√3 * √3 = 48. 

But this contradicts the given equation. 

But if we force BC = 16, then the angles would not add up. 

But given that the problem provides conflicting conditions, and assuming that the equation is correct (since it's part of the given), perhaps the intended answer is BC = 16, which is option C. 

Even though it creates a contradiction in the angles, perhaps the problem assumes that the angle at A is 60°, and the equation is correct, leading to BC=16. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at A is not 60°, but the given angle is different. 

But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)) is 60°, which is angle at A. 

Given that, and the other conditions, the only way to satisfy the equation is BC=16, even though it leads to a contradiction in angles. 

Maybe the problem has a typo, and the angle is at B? Let me assume that. 

If angle at B is 60°, then with right angle at B, it's impossible. 

No, because in a right triangle, one angle is 90°, others must add to 90°. So if angle at B is 90°, then other angles are 60° and 30°. 

But if the given angle is at B, then it would be 90°, but it's given as 60°. 

This is very confusing. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the equation sqrt(3)*BC = AB, giving BC = 16, which is option C.
