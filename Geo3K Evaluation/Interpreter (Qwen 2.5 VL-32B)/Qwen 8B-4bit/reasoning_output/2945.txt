Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points, lines, circles, and angles mentioned.

Points: H, K, J, F, G, I. Lines: H-K, H-F, H-J, K-G, F-G, J-I. Angles: Angle at HJK, HFK. There's also mentions of tangents to a circle G, so maybe there's a circle involved here. Also, some points lie on lines and circles, like I being on HJ and on the circle G. Points F and K are on the circle G, and lines GF and GK are radii since they're stated as IsRadiusOf. So, circle G has center at G? Wait, because the radius would be from G to F and G to K. That means F and K are points on the circle with center G. Therefore, GF and GK are radii of the circle centered at G.

Also, there are two tangent lines: Line HF is tangent to circle G, and Line HK is tangent to circle G. Since HF and HK are tangent to the same circle, and both pass through point H. So, H is outside the circle, and HF and HK are two tangent segments from H to the circle. That implies that HF = HK because tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. But wait, the problem states that Line(H,F) and Line(H,K) are both tangent to the circle. However, looking at the Congruent(Line(H,F), Line(H,K)) predicate, which says that HF and HK are congruent. Which aligns with the property that tangent segments from the same point are equal. So that checks out.

Now, the angles given are Angle(H,J,K) and Angle(H,F,K). Also, RightAngle(Angle(G,F,H)) and RightAngle(Angle(G,K,H)). So, angles at G, between F-H and K-H are right angles. That suggests that lines GF and GK are perpendicular to lines HF and HK respectively. Because if the angle at G between GF and FH is a right angle, then GF is perpendicular to HF. Similarly, GK is perpendicular to HK.

Wait, but GF is a radius, and HF is a tangent. The radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. So, if HF is tangent to the circle at F, then GF (the radius) should be perpendicular to HF. Similarly, GK is perpendicular to HK. Therefore, angles at G, between GF and HF, and between GK and HK are right angles. So those right angles are confirmed by the given predicates.

Now, considering triangle HFG and HKG. Both have right angles at G. So, triangles HFG and HKG are right triangles with right angles at G, and hypotenuse HF and HK respectively. Also, since HF and HK are congruent (given), and GF and GK are radii (so they are equal in length), then triangles HFG and HKG are congruent by Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) congruence. Hence, angles at H in these triangles should be equal. Wait, but angle at H in triangle HFG is angle FGH, but we need to find angle H, which is likely the angle at point H between lines HJ and something else?

Wait, the main question is to find measure of angle H, which is probably angle JHK or another angle involving point H. Wait, the question says "m∠H". Typically, ∠H refers to the angle at point H. But without more context, it's ambiguous unless specified. However, given the diagram elements, perhaps referring to angle formed by lines HJ and HK, or HJ and HF, or something else.

But let's look back at the given predicates. There's an Angle(H,J,K) and Angle(H,F,K). Also, the use of the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem and Tangent Tangent Angle Theorem. The problem mentions applying these theorems. 

So, the first thing is to consider the angles mentioned. For instance, Angle(H,J,K) is the angle at H between lines HJ and HK. Similarly, Angle(H,F,K) is the angle at H between lines HF and HK. Wait, but the Angle(H,F,K) would be the angle at F? No, the standard notation is Angle(ABC) is the angle at point B. So Angle(H,F,K) is the angle at point F between points H, F, K. Wait, but that seems odd. Wait, no. Wait, in standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at vertex B. So, Angle(H,F,K) would be the angle at F between points H, F, K. But that conflicts with the earlier mention of the tangent lines. Hmm, but maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the notation. Let me check again. The given predicates include:

- Angle(H,J,K): This is the angle at J, between H, J, K. So vertex at J.

- Angle(H,F,K): This is the angle at F, between H, F, K. So vertex at F.

But then the UseTheorem(TangentSecantAngleTheorem, Angle(H,J,K), Arc(K,I)) suggests that Angle(H,J,K) is used with arc KI. Also, the other theorem applies to Angle(H,F,K) with arc KF.

But let's try to visualize the diagram. We have point H connected to K, F, J. From H, there are three lines: H to K, H to F, H to J. Then, K is connected to G, F is connected to G, and J is connected to I. Also, points I lies on line HJ and on the circle G. So, I is the intersection of line HJ with the circle G.

Given that, maybe we can think about power of a point, tangent segments, and angles.

Since HF and HK are tangents from H to circle G, then HI is another line from H passing through J and intersecting the circle at I. So, HJ passes through I, which is on the circle. So, HJ is a secant line passing through the circle at I and possibly another point? Or just I?

Wait, the IntersectionOf(Line(H,J), Circle(G), Point(I)) indicates that line HJ intersects the circle G at point I. So, I is one intersection point. But since H is outside the circle, the line HJ could intersect the circle once at I, implying that HJ is tangent at I? But that's not necessarily the case. Unless HJ is tangent, but the problem doesn't state that. Alternatively, HJ could pass through the circle at I and another point. But the way the predicate is written, it's saying that the intersection is point I, which suggests that line HJ meets the circle only at I. Wait, but that would mean that HJ is tangent to the circle at I. But why? Because if a line passes through a circle and intersects it at exactly one point, it's tangent. Otherwise, it's a secant. But according to the predicate, the intersection is point I, so HJ is tangent at I. But then that would imply that I is the point of tangency. However, the problem also states that Point(I) lies on Line(H,J), which is consistent with that.

But then, if HJ is tangent to the circle G at I, then the radius GI is perpendicular to HJ. Because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. So, GI ⊥ HJ. Therefore, angle between GI and HJ is 90 degrees.

Now, looking at the given Angle(H,J,K). Earlier, we thought that was the angle at J between H, J, K. But if HJ is tangent at I, then maybe there's a relationship between that angle and the arcs.

The problem uses the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem for Angle(H,J,K) and Arc(K,I). Wait, the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if we have a tangent and a secant, the angle is (arc - arc)/2.

In this case, if Angle(H,J,K) is formed by tangent HI (since HJ is tangent at I) and secant JK? Wait, but where is the secant? Let me think. The angle at J is between HJ and JK. Since HJ is tangent at I, and JK is a line from J to K. Wait, but K is a point on the circle. Because Point(K) lies on Circle(G), as per the predicate PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K), Circle(G)). So, K is on the circle. So, line JK connects point J to point K, which is on the circle. Therefore, JK is a secant starting from J and going to K on the circle. But since HJ is tangent at I, then the angle at J between tangent HJ and secant JK would be related to the arcs.

According to the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem, the measure of angle at J (which is Angle(H,J,K)) is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, it's half the difference between the arc from K to I and the arc from I to ... Wait, the formula is (measure of larger arc - smaller arc)/2. But since the tangent is at I, and the secant goes from J to K, which is on the circle, then the intercepted arcs would be the arc from I to K (the arc that's cut off by the secant and tangent). Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me recall the exact statement: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The angle is formed outside the circle, and the intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant and tangent meet the circle, minus the arc opposite. In this case, the tangent is at point I (on the circle), and the secant starts at J and goes through K (also on the circle). Wait, but J is not necessarily on the circle. Wait, J is a point such that line HJ exists. But does J lie on the circle? Not directly stated. Wait, the only points on the circle are F, K, and I. Because the predicates say PointLiesOnCircle(Point(F), Circle(G)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K), Circle(G)), and Point(I) is on Line(H,J) and on the circle. So, I is on the circle, but J is not necessarily. So, the secant would be from J to K, where K is on the circle, and the tangent is from J to I, which is also on the circle. Wait, but HJ is tangent at I, so J is outside the circle, and line HJ touches the circle only at I. So, the angle at J between the tangent HJ and the secant JK is formed by a tangent and a secant. Thus, applying the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem, the measure of angle J (Angle(H,J,K)) is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

The intercepted arcs would be the arc from I to K that's farther away from the angle, and the arc from I to K that's closer. Wait, but since the tangent is at I and the secant goes to K, the angle at J intercepts the arc from I to K that's opposite to the angle. So, the measure of angle J is (arc IK - arc... well, there's only one arc between I and K? Wait, no. On a circle, there are two arcs between any two points. The major arc and minor arc. So, the angle formed outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, if the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then it's half the difference between the intercepted arc (the arc that's not containing the point J) and the arc that's between the points where the secant meets the circle. Wait, but in this case, the secant is from J to K, and the tangent is at I. So, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from I to K that doesn't contain J (assuming J is outside the circle) and the arc from I to K that contains J. Wait, but since J is outside, the angle is formed outside, so the intercepted arcs are the arc between I and K that's opposite to the angle. So, the measure of angle J is (measure of arc IK) / 2, but actually, the formula is (difference of arcs)/2. Wait, the formula is:

Measure of angle = ½ (measure of intercepted arc - measure of adjacent arc)

But in this case, since the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, the intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant meets the circle and the arc between the tangent point and the other intersection. Wait, but the secant only meets the circle at K, since J is outside. Wait, no, the secant is from J to K, but K is on the circle. So, the secant meets the circle only at K. And the tangent meets the circle only at I. So, the angle at J is formed by the tangent at I and the secant from J to K. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from I to K that's not containing J, and the arc from I to K that is... Well, since there's only one arc between I and K, but depending on direction. Maybe the formula simplifies here. Let me check.

Actually, when you have a tangent and a secant, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant meets the circle (in this case, just point K) and the arc between the tangent point (point I) and the other intersection. Wait, but the secant only intersects the circle once (at K), and the tangent intersects once (at I). So, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from I to K that's not containing the angle, and the arc from I to K that is... Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to refer to the exact theorem.

The Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant and tangent meet the circle. Since the tangent meets the circle at I, and the secant meets the circle at K, the intercepted arcs are the arc from I to K that is opposite the angle (the arc that does not contain the external point J) and the arc from I to K that does contain the external point J. Wait, but in this case, the angle is at J, which is outside the circle, so the intercepted arcs are the arc between I and K that is opposite the angle and the arc between I and K that's the rest. Wait, but since the angle is formed by the tangent at I and the secant from J to K, the intercepted arcs are the arc from I to K that's not containing J (the arc that's far side) and the arc from I to K that is the small arc. But since the angle is formed outside, the measure is half the difference between the larger arc and the smaller arc.

However, in our case, since the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, and the intercepted arcs are the arc between I and K. Wait, but since there are two arcs between I and K, the larger and smaller ones. The measure of the angle would be half the difference between them. But without knowing the specific arcs, how do we proceed?

But maybe there's more information. Let's see. Also, there's another angle given: Angle(H,F,K), which is the angle at F between H, F, K. And the problem uses the Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem for that angle. The Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by two tangents drawn from a single external point is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. In this case, if we have two tangents from point H to circle G, which are HF and HK. So, angle at H between HF and HK would be formed by two tangents, hence applying the Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem. But the given angle is Angle(H,F,K), which is at F, not at H. Wait, confusion again. Wait, Angle(H,F,K) is the angle at F between H, F, K. So, that's different from the angle at H between HF and HK. But maybe there's a relation.

Wait, the given Angle(H,F,K) is the angle at F between H, F, K. Given that HF is tangent to the circle at F, and FK is a line from F to K, which is also on the circle. So, the angle at F between HF (tangent) and FK (secant) would be another application of the Tangent Secant Angle Theorem. Wait, but FK is a secant? Wait, F is on the circle, so line FK goes from F (on the circle) to K (also on the circle). So, FK is a chord of the circle. Therefore, the angle at F between tangent HF and chord FK would be equal to half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the chord FK. Wait, the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, angle at F between tangent HF and chord FK would be half the measure of arc from K to the point where the tangent meets the circle, but since the tangent is at F itself, the intercepted arc would be the arc from K to the point diametrically opposite? Wait, no. The angle between tangent and chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc that's opposite the angle. So, if we have a tangent at F and a chord FK, then the angle at F is half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the chord FK and not containing the tangent point. Wait, but since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent leaves the circle. But since the tangent is at F, the arc would be the arc from K to the point opposite? Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally.

At point F, there's a tangent line HF and a chord FK. The angle between them is at F. According to the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, this angle equals half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that's not containing the point where the tangent meets the circle. Wait, but since the tangent meets the circle at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent meets the circle, but since the tangent meets at F, it's the arc from K to F? No, that's not right. Wait, the intercepted arc is the arc that's cut off by the chord and the tangent. Wait, maybe the angle is half the measure of the arc that's opposite to the angle. So, the angle at F between tangent HF and chord FK intercepts the arc that's across from it, which would be the arc from K to the point diametrically opposite to F, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is half the measure of the arc that's subtended by the chord. Wait, the angle between the tangent and the chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle, which would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent meets the circle. But since the tangent is at F, the arc is from K to F along the circle. Wait, but that arc would be part of the circle. However, since the tangent is at F, the angle is formed by the tangent and the chord, so the intercepted arc is the arc that's not containing the tangent point. Wait, but the tangent is at F, so the arc would be the arc from K to F, but that's just a single point. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to recall the exact theorem.

The Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord at the point of contact is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, i.e., the arc that is not overlapping with the tangent. In this case, the angle at F between tangent HF and chord FK intercepts the arc that's opposite to the angle, which would be the arc from K to the point diametrically opposite to F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent meets the circle, which is just F itself. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the angle is half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the chord FK. Wait, if the angle is formed by the tangent and the chord, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, which would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent leaves the circle. But since the tangent is at F, it's just the arc from K to F. Wait, but that arc is zero length. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding something here.

Maybe I should take a different approach. Let's consider the given angles and the theorems applied. The problem states that UseTheorem(TangentSecantAngleTheorem, Angle(H,J,K), Arc(K,I)) and UseTheorem(TangentTangentAngleTheorem, Angle(H,F,K), Arc(K,F)). 

For the first theorem, TangentSecantAngleTheorem, the angle at J (Angle(H,J,K)) is formed by the tangent HJ (which is tangent at I) and the secant JK (from J to K). According to the theorem, this angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Assuming the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K (not containing J) and arc from I to K (containing J). But since J is outside the circle, the angle is half the difference between the larger arc and the smaller arc. However, without knowing the specific arcs, perhaps there's another way.

Similarly, for the second theorem, TangentTangentAngleTheorem, Angle(H,F,K) is formed by two tangents from H to the circle at F and K. Wait, no, the angle is at F, not at H. Wait, Angle(H,F,K) is at F between H, F, K. So, it's formed by the tangent at F (HF) and the line FK. But FK is a chord from F to K. So, this is a tangent and a chord, forming an angle at F. Hence, applying the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, which says this angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc would be the arc from K to the point where the tangent leaves the circle, but since the tangent is at F, it's the arc from K to F. Wait, but that's the same as the arc from F to K, which is just a chord. So, the measure of the angle at F would be half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the tangent and chord. But since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite to the angle, which would be the arc from K to the point diametrically opposite to F. Wait, I'm stuck.

Let me try to find relations between the given angles. Let's denote:

Let’s assume that the circle has center G, with radii GF and GK. Since GF and GK are radii, they are equal. Also, HF and HK are tangent to the circle, so HF = HK. Also, angles at G (RightAngle(Angle(G,F,H)) and RightAngle(Angle(G,K,H))) indicate that GF ⊥ HF and GK ⊥ HK. So, triangles HGF and HKG are right triangles with legs GF and GK (equal), and hypotenuses HF and HK (equal). So, triangles HGF ≅ HKG by HL congruence.

Therefore, angles at H in these triangles are equal. In triangle HGF, right-angled at G, angle at H is ∠G H F. Similarly, in triangle HKG, right-angled at G, angle at H is ∠G H K. These angles are equal. Let's call this angle θ. So, ∠G H F = ∠G H K = θ. Since the sum of angles in a right triangle is 90° + θ + other angle = 90°, but wait, in each right triangle, the angles at H and at F/K are complementary. Wait, in triangle HGF, angles are right angle at G, angle at H is θ, and angle at F is 90° - θ. Similarly for triangle HKG.

Now, considering angle at H between HF and HK, which is ∠F H K. But since HF and HK are both tangents, and the angle between them is formed by two tangents from H, which would be twice the angle between either tangent and the line joining H to the center G. Wait, but since GF and GK are radii, and H is outside the circle, the line HG would bisect the angle between the two tangents. So, the angle between HF and HK is 2θ, where θ is the angle between HF and HG, or between HK and HG. Wait, but how does this relate to other angles?

But the problem asks for m∠H, which is likely referring to angle at H between HJ and something else. But given that there are several angles mentioned, perhaps we need to connect them.

Looking back, the problem involves Angle(H,J,K) and Angle(H,F,K), and uses the theorems mentioned. Let's focus on Angle(H,J,K) first. Using the TangentSecantAngleTheorem, this angle is formed by tangent HJ (which is tangent at I) and secant JK. According to the theorem, its measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Suppose the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K (let's call this arc IK) and the arc from I to K passing through the other side (but since the circle is around G, and K and I are points on the circle, the arcs depend on the position).

Assuming that the angle at J is formed by tangent HJ and secant JK, then the measure of angle J is ½(arc IK - arc ... ?). But since there's only one arc between I and K, perhaps the other arc is considered as zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K that's not containing the tangent point (I) and the arc from I to K that's containing the tangent point? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since HJ is tangent at I, and the secant is from J to K, then the angle at J is formed by the tangent at I and the secant JK. The intercepted arcs are the arc from I to K that's not containing J and the arc from I to K that is contained within the circle. Wait, but since J is outside the circle, the angle is formed outside, so the intercepted arcs are the arc between I and K that is opposite the angle, which is the arc that doesn't include the tangent point. Wait, this is too vague without a diagram.

Let me try to think differently. Since we know that GF and GK are radii, and angles at G are right angles. Also, points F and K are on the circle, so GF and GK are radii. The line FG is perpendicular to HF, and GK is perpendicular to HK. So, HF is perpendicular to GF, and HK is perpendicular to GK. Since GF and GK are radii, they form two sides of the circle. Let's imagine that points F and K are symmetric with respect to line HG, making the circle symmetric. But since HF and HK are congruent, and GF and GK are radii, this symmetry may hold.

Now, since line HJ intersects the circle at I, and I is on the circle, then HI is a tangent at I. So, GI is perpendicular to HI. Therefore, angle between GI and HI is 90°. Now, considering triangle HGI, where GI is a radius and HI is a tangent, so right-angled at I. 

Now, if we can relate angle at J (Angle(H,J,K)) with other angles. Let's think about the arcs. Suppose that arc from I to K is x degrees. Then, according to the TangentSecantAngleTheorem, angle at J is ½(x - y), where y is the measure of the other arc. But without knowing the total circumference, it's hard to proceed. However, if we can find x and y in terms of other known quantities.

Alternatively, since angle at F between HF and FK (Angle(H,F,K)) is formed by a tangent and a chord. Applying the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, this angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc from K to the point where the tangent meets the circle, which is F itself. Wait, but that would mean the angle is half the measure of arc from K to F, which is arc KF. So, measure of Angle(H,F,K) = ½(m(arc KF)). Similarly, for Angle(H,J,K), using the TangentSecantAngleTheorem, it would be ½(m(arc IK) - m(arc ... )).

But since the circle has points F and K, and I is another point. Let's suppose that arc from I to K is equal to arc from K to F plus arc from F to I, but depends on the arrangement.

But let's consider that the angle at F (Angle(H,F,K)) is formed by tangent HF and chord FK. So, according to the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, this angle is ½ the measure of arc KF. Let's call this measure α. So, Angle(H,F,K) = ½α.

Similarly, Angle(H,J,K) is formed by tangent HJ (at I) and secant JK. Applying the TangentSecantAngleTheorem, it's ½(measure of arc IK - measure of arc ... ). Wait, if the angle is formed by tangent and secant, it's ½(difference of intercepted arcs). If the intercepted arcs are arc IK (the one not containing J) and arc IK' (the other arc), but since there's only one arc between I and K, this might be the case where the angle is ½(arc IK). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the angle at J is formed by tangent HJ and secant JK, and assuming that the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K (let's say arc IK) and the arc from I to K that is the rest of the circle. But since the angle is outside, it's ½(arc IK - arc ... ) where arc ... is the arc that is inside the angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since the circle has points F, K, and I. Let's consider that the arc from I to K is x, and from K to F is y, and from F to I is z. Total circumference is 360°, so x + y + z = 360°. 

From Angle(H,F,K) = ½(y), since it's the angle formed by tangent at F and chord FK, which intercepts arc from K to F (y). 

From Angle(H,J,K) = ½(x - z), assuming that the angle is formed by tangent at I and secant JK, intercepting arc IK (x) and arc IZ (z)? Not sure.

But if we can find relations between these arcs. Also, since HF and HK are tangents, and GF and GK are radii, the angles at F and K are right angles. So, triangles HGF and HKG are right-angled at G. Also, HF = HK, as given.

Now, let's think about the entire setup. The circle has points F, K, and I. Line HJ passes through I, which is on the circle. So, HJ is tangent at I. Thus, GI is perpendicular to HJ. So, angle between GI and HJ is 90°. 

Now, if we can relate angle at J (Angle(H,J,K)) with other parts. Suppose that angle at J is ½(arc IK), since it's formed by tangent and secant. If that were the case, and if we can express arc IK in terms of other arcs. 

Alternatively, since angle at F (Angle(H,F,K)) is ½(arc KF), and angle at J is ½(arc IK), and if we can find a relation between arc KF and arc IK.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. However, since the circle has points F and K, and I is another point. If we assume that arc KF is equal to arc IK, then the angles would be equal. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, considering the symmetry. Since HF and HK are congruent, and GF and GK are radii, the circle might be symmetric with respect to line HG. So, points F and K are symmetric with respect to line HG. Thus, arc KF would be equal to arc FI or something similar. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Another approach: Let's use the fact that angles at F and K are right angles. In triangle HGF, right-angled at G, with GF as radius r, and HF as tangent. So, HF^2 = GH^2 - GF^2. Similarly for HK. Since HF = HK, this holds. Let's denote GH as d, the distance from H to the center G. Then, HF = sqrt(d² - r²).

Now, considering angle at H between HF and HK, which is angle FHK. Since HF and HK are congruent, and the triangle formed by H, G, and the midpoint of FK would be symmetrical. But how does this relate to the other angles?

Alternatively, since angle at J is related to arcs, and angle at F is related to arc KF, maybe there's a way to connect these.

Let me try to assign variables. Let’s say that the measure of arc KF is α, so Angle(H,F,K) = ½α. Similarly, if Angle(H,J,K) is β, then β = ½(arc IK - arc ... ). But without knowing the exact arcs, it's tricky. However, if we can find that arc IK is equal to arc KF + arc FI, but this depends on the arrangement.

Alternatively, since I is on the circle, and HJ is tangent at I, then line HJ is tangent at I, so GI ⊥ HJ. Also, since GI is a radius, and HJ is tangent at I, then GI is perpendicular to HJ. So, angle between GI and HJ is 90°. Let's consider triangle GHI, which is right-angled at I. So, GH² = GI² + HI². Since GI is radius r, and HI is the length of the tangent from H to the circle, which is sqrt(GH² - r²). 

Now, connecting this to angle at J. If we can find angle at J in terms of other angles. Let's think about triangle HJI. Since I is on the circle, and J is a point such that HJ passes through I. But how does this help?

Perhaps the key is to realize that angle at J (Angle(H,J,K)) is supplementary to angle at F (Angle(H,F,K))? Or some other relation. 

Alternatively, since we have two angles formed by tangents and chords/secants, and we might be able to relate them via the circle's properties. 

Let me try to calculate the measure of Angle(H,F,K) first. As per the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, it's half the measure of the arc it intercepts. The angle at F between HF (tangent) and FK (chord) intercepts arc KF. So, if arc KF measures α, then Angle(H,F,K) = ½α. 

Similarly, Angle(H,J,K) is formed by tangent HJ (at I) and secant JK. By the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem, this angle is ½(measure of arc IK - measure of arc ... ). But if the angle is formed by tangent and secant, the formula is ½(measure of intercepted arc - measure of arc opposite). But since the angle is outside the circle, it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K (let's say arc IK) and arc from I to K through the other side (arc IK'). But since the circle is 360°, arc IK + arc IK' = 360°. But without knowing which arc is which, it's hard to say. However, typically, the angle is half the difference of the larger arc and the smaller arc. 

Assume that arc IK is the arc that is opposite the angle, and the other arc is the smaller one. So, if arc IK is x, then the angle is ½(x - y), where y is the measure of the other arc. But if the total circumference is 360°, then x + y = 360°, so the angle is ½(x - (360° - x)) = ½(2x - 360°) = x - 180°. But this would give negative values if x < 180°, which isn't possible. So, likely, the angle is ½(the larger arc - the smaller arc). 

But without knowing which arc is larger, it's still unclear. Let's suppose that arc IK is the larger arc, and the angle is ½(larger arc - smaller arc). But without knowing the actual arcs, it's still difficult. 

Let me try to connect this with other information. Since the circle has points F and K, and I is another point. Let's assume that arc from K to F is α, and arc from F to I is β, and arc from I to K is γ. So, α + β + γ = 360°. 

From Angle(H,F,K) = ½α (as explained earlier). 

From Angle(H,J,K), if it's formed by tangent at I and secant JK, then it would intercept arc from I to K (γ) and the other arc from I to K (which is α + β). Wait, but that depends on the arrangement. 

If the angle at J is formed by tangent at I and secant JK, then the intercepted arcs are arc IK (γ) and arc IK through the other side, which would be α + β. So, the measure of the angle is ½(γ - (α + β)) = ½(γ - (360° - γ)) = ½(2γ - 360°) = γ - 180°. But this would require γ > 180°, which may or may not be the case. 

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's consider that the sum of the two angles at F and J relates to the full circle. 

Alternatively, since HF and HK are tangents, and GI is perpendicular to HJ, and GF and GK are radii, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles at F and J. 

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let's consider the angles at H. The problem asks for m∠H. Given that there are right angles at G, and the congruent triangles HGF and HKG, which are right-angled at G. The angle at H in each triangle is θ, so the angle between HF and HG is θ, and similarly for HK and HG. Since HF and HK are congruent, and GF and GK are congruent, the triangles are congruent, so θ is the same in both. 

Now, the angle between HF and HK at point H is 2θ, because it's the angle between the two tangents. But how does this relate to the other angles? 

Wait, but the question is asking for m∠H, which could be this angle between HF and HK, which is 2θ. If we can find θ, then double it. 

But how to find θ? Let's consider triangle HGF, right-angled at G. So, tan(theta) = GF/HG. Wait, no. In right triangle HGF, angle at H is theta, with opposite side GF (radius r), and adjacent side HG (distance from H to center G). So, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = r / HG. 

But without knowing the lengths, this might not help. 

Alternatively, if we can relate theta to the arcs. Since angle at F (Angle(H,F,K)) is ½α, and alpha is arc KF. Also, angle at J is beta = ½(arc IK - arc ... ), but this is still unclear. 

Wait, let's try to think about the fact that angles at F and J are related to arcs, and those arcs might be connected through the circle. For example, if arc KF is α, and arc IK is gamma, then maybe there's a relationship between alpha and gamma. 

But I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to assume specific values. Let's say that arc KF is 60°, so Angle(H,F,K) = 30°. If that's the case, and if Angle(H,J,K) is something else, but how? 

Alternatively, since the problem gives answer choices, maybe we can work backwards. Let's assume that m∠H is one of the options, say 62° (option C). Then, since the angle between HF and HK is 2θ, and if θ is 31°, then 2θ = 62°, which would match option C. How can we get θ?

If Angle(H,F,K) is ½α, and if we can find α. Let's say that angle at F is 31°, then α = 62°. Then, arc KF is 62°. If the circle has points F and K separated by 62°, then the angle between the tangents from H would be 2θ, where θ is the angle between HF and HG. In triangle HGF, tan(theta) = r / HG. But without knowing r or HG, it's not helpful. 

But if we consider that angle between HF and HK is 2θ, and this angle might relate to the arcs. For example, if the arc KF is 62°, then the angle between the tangents might be related to this arc. 

Alternatively, since the angle between the tangents (at H) is equal to the difference between the arcs. Wait, no. The angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, yes! The Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem states that the measure of the angle formed by two tangents from an external point is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

Ah! So, the angle at H between HF and HK is formed by two tangents, so its measure is ½(measure of arc FK - measure of arc F'K'), where arc FK is the arc between F and K that's intercepted by the tangents, and arc F'K' is the other arc. But since the circle is 360°, the measure of the angle is ½(360° - 2*arc FK) = 180° - arc FK. Wait, no. Let me recall the exact formula. 

The measure of the angle formed by two tangents is ½(measure of the intercepted arc - measure of the other arc). But since the two intercepted arcs add up to 360°, the angle is ½(360° - 2*intercepted arc). Wait, no. Let me think. When two tangents are drawn from an external point, they intercept two arcs: the minor arc and the major arc. The angle between the tangents is ½(measure of major arc - measure of minor arc). 

So, if the angle at H is between two tangents, then its measure is ½(major arc FK - minor arc FK). 

Let’s denote the measure of minor arc FK as α, then major arc FK is 360° - α. So, the angle at H is ½((360° - α) - α) = ½(360° - 2α) = 180° - α. 

But from earlier, Angle(H,F,K) is ½α (since it's half the measure of arc KF, which is α). So, if Angle(H,F,K) is ½α, then α = 2 * Angle(H,F,K). 

Let’s denote Angle(H,F,K) as β. So, α = 2β. Substituting into the angle at H, we get:

Angle at H = 180° - α = 180° - 2β.

But we also have that Angle(H,J,K) is related to other arcs. Let's go back to Angle(H,J,K). It's formed by tangent HJ (at I) and secant JK. Applying the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem, this angle is ½(measure of intercepted arc - measure of other arc). 

Assuming the angle at J is formed by tangent HJ (at I) and secant JK, the intercepted arcs are arc from I to K (let's say arc IK) and the other arc from I to K. Let's say the measure of arc IK is γ, and the other arc is δ. So, Angle(H,J,K) = ½(γ - δ). 

But since the circle is 360°, γ + δ = 360°, so Angle(H,J,K) = ½(γ - (360° - γ)) = ½(2γ - 360°) = γ - 180°. But this requires γ > 180°, which would mean that the angle
