MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ, and there's a point A where lines WX and YZ intersect. Also, there are several angles mentioned, like Angle 1 is 30 degrees, and some others are right angles. We need to find the measure of angle 2.

First, I should recall that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each corner has 90 degrees. But since there's a point A where lines WX and YZ intersect, maybe that creates some triangles inside the rectangle?

Looking at the given predicates, there's a lot about lines and angles. For example, Line(W,X) and Line(Y,Z) are parallel because of the Parallel predicate. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel, which aligns with that. Also, the intersection of these two lines is point A, so A must be the midpoint? Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, but here the lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, not diagonals. Wait, hold on—WX and YZ are opposite sides of the rectangle, so they're parallel and shouldn't intersect unless extended? But the problem says their intersection is point A. That suggests that lines WX and YZ are being extended beyond the rectangle to meet at A. Hmm, that might form some triangles.

Also, there are congruent triangles mentioned: Triangle(W,A,X) is congruent to Triangle(Z,A,Y). Similarly, Triangle(W,A,Y) is congruent to Triangle(X,A,Z). Maybe those triangles are right triangles? Because the original rectangle has right angles. Let me think.

Since WXYZ is a rectangle, angles at W, X, Y, Z are all 90 degrees. Now, considering lines WX and YZ are parallel, and they intersect at A. Wait, but in a rectangle, sides WX and YZ are parallel and part of the same side? No, wait, WXYZ is a rectangle, so sides WX and YZ are opposite sides. In a standard rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, but they don't intersect unless extended. So if we extend them, they would meet at a point, forming some kind of 'X' shape.

So, point A is where the extensions of WX and YZ meet. Then, connecting A to other points forms triangles. Let me visualize this. Suppose the rectangle is WXYZ, with W connected to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to W. Extending WX and YZ until they meet at A. Then, lines WA and AZ would form triangles with other sides.

Now, looking at the congruent triangles: Triangle(WAX) ≅ Triangle(ZAY). Let me consider their corresponding parts. If these triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles and sides are equal. Since the rectangle has right angles, maybe these triangles are right triangles?

Wait, angle at A for Triangle(WAX): since line WA is an extension of WX, and line AX connects to point X. Wait, perhaps there are right angles involved here. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the triangles are congruent implies certain angle measures.

Also, given that Angle 1 is 30 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle 2. There are also Angles 9,10,11,12 marked as right angles. Maybe these correspond to certain angles in the diagram.

Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, since WXYZ is a rectangle, all its internal angles are 90 degrees. Lines WX and YZ are parallel. Their intersection at point A means that lines WX and YZ are not just sides of the rectangle but are extended to meet at A. This setup suggests that point A lies outside the rectangle, forming two pairs of vertical angles.

Because of the parallel lines, the angles formed at A should follow the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. However, since WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and AZ are transversals? Wait, actually, WA is along the extension of WX, and AZ is along the extension of YZ. So, lines WA and AZ are two lines meeting at A, with WA and YZ being parallel. Therefore, the angles around point A could be determined using the properties of parallel lines.

But how does this relate to the given angles? Let's note that Angle 1 is 30 degrees. Where is Angle 1 located? The problem mentions Angle(1), Angle(2), ..., up to Angle(12). It's possible that these angles refer to specific angles formed at point A or elsewhere.

Given that there are congruent triangles, maybe angle 1 is one of the base angles of those triangles. For instance, if Triangle(WAX) is congruent to Triangle(ZAY), then corresponding angles would be equal. Let me assume that angle 1 is one of the angles in these triangles.

Alternatively, considering the right angles given, such as MeasureOf(Angle(9))=90, etc., which are likely right angles at various points. For example, Angle(9) could be a right angle at point A, or somewhere else.

Another thought: Since the lines WX and YZ are parallel, and they intersect at A, the angles formed at A should be supplementary. For example, if one angle is 30 degrees (Angle 1), then the adjacent angle would be 180-30=150 degrees. But without knowing the position of Angle 1, it's hard to say.

However, the problem states that m∠1 = 30°, and asks for m∠2. Perhaps ∠1 and ∠2 are adjacent angles formed by the intersection at A, making them supplementary. But if ∠1 is 30°, then ∠2 would be 150°, which isn't among the options. Wait, but the answer choices are 30, 60, 90, 120. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe ∠1 and ∠2 are angles within the triangles. Let me think again about the congruent triangles.

Triangles WAX and ZAY are congruent. So, angle at A in Triangle WAX corresponds to angle at A in Triangle ZAY. If those angles are equal, then maybe ∠1 is one of those angles. Let me denote the angles.

In Triangle WAX, suppose angle at A is ∠WAX. If that's congruent to angle at A in Triangle ZAY, which would be ∠ZAY. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. Also, since the original lines are parallel, maybe there are alternate interior angles.

Wait, but since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and AZ are transversals, the angles formed at A would depend on the direction of the transversals. Let me imagine extending WX and YZ to meet at A. Let me assume that WA is an extension of WX beyond W, and AZ is an extension of YZ beyond Z. Or maybe WA extends WX beyond X, and AZ extends YZ beyond Y. Depending on which way the lines are extended, the angles would change.

Alternatively, since the rectangle's sides WX and YZ are horizontal (assuming standard orientation), their extensions would go off in opposite directions. For example, if the rectangle is oriented so that WX is horizontal, then extending WX to the left and YZ to the right would meet at a point A above or below the rectangle.

Assuming that, then lines WA and AZ would form some angles. Let me consider that.

Suppose the rectangle is placed with W at bottom-left, X at bottom-right, Y at top-right, Z at top-left. So, sides WX and YZ are the bottom and top sides respectively. Extending WX to the left and YZ to the right would meet at a point A. Wait, but if you extend WX to the left (from W to the left) and YZ to the right (from Z to the right), those lines would diverge and never meet. Alternatively, if we extend WX upwards and YZ downwards, they might meet at a point above or below.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the direction of the lines. Let me try to sketch mentally:

Original rectangle W-X-Y-Z-W. So, moving from W to X to Y to Z to W. So, if I take line WX (from W to X) and line YZ (from Y to Z). These lines are opposite sides of the rectangle, hence parallel. To make them intersect, they must be extended beyond their endpoints. For example, extending WX past X and YZ past Y, or extending WX past W and YZ past Z.

Assume that lines WX and YZ are extended beyond X and Y respectively to meet at point A. So, line WA would be the extension of WX beyond X, and line AZ would be the extension of YZ beyond Y. Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, extending WX past W and YZ past Z to meet at A.

Alternatively, maybe lines WA and AZ are the ones that intersect at A. Wait, the problem states IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)). So, the lines WX and YZ intersect at A. Which means that lines WX and YZ are not just the sides of the rectangle but are extended to meet at A. Thus, the lines WX and YZ are not just the sides but are infinite lines, so they must intersect at A.

Therefore, the lines WX and YZ are parallel, but according to the predicate, they do intersect at A. Wait, that's impossible unless they are not parallel. Wait, contradiction! Wait, the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) implies that sides WX and YZ are parallel. But the predicate says Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)), which confirms that. But if two parallel lines cannot intersect, unless they are coincident. But in that case, their intersection would be all points along the line. But the problem specifies that they intersect at a single point A. This seems contradictory.

Ah! Here's the catch: the lines WX and YZ are not the sides of the rectangle, but rather the entire lines, including their extensions. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides WX and YZ are parallel, so their lines are parallel. Hence, they cannot intersect unless they are the same line, which they aren't. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Wait, but the problem gives the predicate IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)), implying that these two lines intersect at A. How can that be if they are parallel? Unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Line(W,A)
Line(A,X)
Line(A,Y)
Line(A,Z)"

And also:

"Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z))"

So, the lines WX and YZ are parallel. But the IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)) suggests that they intersect at A. This is a contradiction unless the lines are not parallel. But the Parallel predicate says they are parallel. So there's inconsistency here. Wait, perhaps the problem uses non-Euclidean geometry? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not the sides of the rectangle but something else.

Wait, another possibility: The lines WX and YZ are not the sides of the rectangle but are different lines. Wait, but the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) defines the rectangle with vertices W, X, Y, Z. So, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Hence, lines WX and YZ are sides of the rectangle, which are parallel. Therefore, their lines are parallel. Therefore, they cannot intersect, unless the rectangle is degenerate, which it's not. 

This suggests there's a contradiction in the problem's predicates. But since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake in understanding the setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A))". So, it's saying that the lines WX and YZ intersect at point A. But in Euclidean geometry, this is only possible if they are not parallel. However, the problem also includes the predicate Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)). So, this is a contradiction. How can two parallel lines intersect? They can't unless they are the same line. Therefore, this suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm misunderstanding the definitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not the sides of the rectangle but something else. Wait, the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) defines the rectangle with vertices W, X, Y, Z. So, the sides are indeed WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Hence, lines WX and YZ are sides of the rectangle and thus are parallel. Therefore, their lines are parallel, so they cannot intersect. Hence, the existence of point A where they intersect contradicts the Parallel predicate. This is confusing.

But since the problem is given as valid, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides of the rectangle, but other lines. Wait, but the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) would imply that those points are arranged as a rectangle, so the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, lines WX and YZ are sides of the rectangle, hence parallel. Hence, the Intersection predicate must be incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not in Euclidean geometry. Or maybe the lines WX and YZ are not straight lines but something else. But the term Line usually refers to a straight line. 

This is perplexing. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must proceed under the assumption that there's a way for lines WX and YZ to intersect at A despite being parallel. Perhaps they are not parallel? But the Parallel predicate says they are. So, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, but I'll have to work with it.

Perhaps the error lies in the interpretation of the Rectangle predicate. Maybe the rectangle is defined in a way that allows for intersecting lines? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but diagonals? No, because the rectangle's diagonals are WY and XZ, not WX and YZ.

Wait, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but the diagonals? Let me check: If WXYZ is a rectangle, then the diagonals are WY and XZ. So, if the lines WX and YZ were diagonals, but that doesn't fit. So, I think there's a mistake in the problem's setup. 

But since I need to proceed, perhaps I should ignore the contradiction and assume that lines WX and YZ are not parallel, even though the problem says they are. Or perhaps the Parallel predicate applies to other lines. Let me re-read the given predicates.

The given predicates are:

- Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)
- Point(W), Point(X), Point(Y), Point(Z), Point(A)
- Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,W)
- Line(W,A), Line(A,X), Line(A,Y), Line(A,Z)
- Angle(1), Angle(2), ..., Angle(12)
- RightAngle(Angle(W,X,Y)), RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z)), RightAngle(Angle(Y,Z,W)), RightAngle(Angle(Z,W,X))
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), 30)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(9)), 90), etc.
- IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A))
- Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z))
- Congruent(Triangle(W,A,X), Triangle(Z,A,Y))
- Congruent(Triangle(W,A,Y), Triangle(X,A,Z))

So, the Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z)) is explicitly stated. And the IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)) is also stated. This is a contradiction in Euclidean geometry. But since the problem is given, I must assume that it's possible. Perhaps the lines are not in a plane? Or the problem is using a different definition. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not straight lines but curves? Unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not the sides of the rectangle but other lines passing through the rectangle. Wait, for example, if Line(W,X) is the side WX, and Line(Y,Z) is another line that intersects it at A. But then the Parallel predicate would require that Line(W,X) and Line(Y,Z) are parallel, but they intersect at A. Again, contradiction.

This seems impossible. But since the problem is presented, I must proceed. Perhaps the key is to use the congruent triangles and the given angles to derive relations regardless of the apparent contradiction.

Let me focus on the congruent triangles: Triangle(W,A,X) ≅ Triangle(Z,A,Y). Since these triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles and sides are equal. Let's analyze their angles.

Triangle WAX has vertices W, A, X. Triangle ZAY has vertices Z, A, Y. If they are congruent, then corresponding angles are equal. For example, angle at A in both triangles would be equal. Also, angles at W and Z, X and Y would be equal.

Additionally, since WXYZ is a rectangle, angles at W, X, Y, Z are right angles. So, angle WXY is 90 degrees, angle XYZ is 90 degrees, etc.

Now, let's consider the lines. If lines WX and YZ intersect at A, then point A is outside the rectangle. Let's assume that A is positioned such that lines WA and AZ form some angles. 

Given that Triangle(WAX) ≅ Triangle(ZAY), then WA = ZA, and XA = YA. Also, angle WAX equals angle ZAY. 

But since WXYZ is a rectangle, the length of WX equals YZ. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Maybe assigning coordinates would help.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s place point W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b), forming a rectangle with width a and height b. 

Then, line WX is from (0,0) to (a,0), and line YZ is from (0,b) to (a,b). Wait, but in this case, lines WX and YZ are horizontal lines y=0 and y=b, respectively. These are parallel and do not intersect. But according to the problem, they intersect at point A. So, this coordinate system doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions. Hence, there must be another configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines WX and YZ are not horizontal. Let me think differently. Suppose the rectangle is rotated, and lines WX and YZ are not aligned horizontally. But regardless of rotation, their lines remain parallel. Hence, they still cannot intersect. 

Thus, the only way for lines WX and YZ to intersect is if they are not parallel, which contradicts the Parallel predicate. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's setup. However, since I need to proceed, I'll assume that the lines WX and YZ are not parallel, despite the predicate, and see if that leads to a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines WX and YZ are not the sides of the rectangle but other lines. Wait, but the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) implies that the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, lines WX and YZ are sides, hence parallel. 

At this point, I think the problem may contain a contradiction, but since it's presented as solvable, I'll proceed assuming that lines WX and YZ are not parallel, even though the Parallel predicate says they are. Perhaps it's a typo, and the intended was to say that lines WA and XZ are parallel, or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but the diagonals. Let me explore that. If WXYZ is a rectangle, then the diagonals are WY and XZ. If instead, lines WX and YZ were the diagonals, then they would intersect at the center of the rectangle. But in that case, the intersection point A would be the center. However, the problem mentions lines WA, AX, AY, AZ, suggesting that A is connected to other points.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but other lines, like the extensions of the sides. For example, if line WX is extended beyond W and X, and line YZ is extended beyond Y and Z, then they might intersect at A. But in that case, lines WX and YZ would still be parallel, so their extensions would never meet unless they are not parallel.

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll try to focus on the congruent triangles and the given angles.

Given that Triangles WAX and ZAY are congruent, and the rectangle has right angles, perhaps the triangles are right triangles. For example, if angle at X in triangle WAX is 90 degrees, then it's a right triangle. Let me assume that.

In triangle WAX, if it's a right triangle, then one of its angles is 90 degrees. Similarly for triangle ZAY. Since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle at X is 90 degrees. So, if line AX is drawn from A to X, and line WX is extended to A, then angle at X would be between WX and XA. If that angle is 90 degrees, then triangle WAX is a right triangle.

Similarly, for triangle ZAY, if line AY is drawn from A to Y, and line YZ is extended to A, then angle at Y would be between YZ and YA. If that angle is 90 degrees, then triangle ZAY is also a right triangle. 

Given that, and since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. So, if angle at X is 90 degrees, then angle at Y is also 99 degrees, which makes sense. 

Now, given that, let's consider the angles at point A. Since lines WA and AZ intersect at A, and triangles WAX and ZAY are right triangles, the angles at A would be complementary to the given angle 1.

But the problem says that MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 30 degrees. Assuming that angle 1 is one of the angles in these triangles, perhaps the acute angle at A. For example, in triangle WAX, if it's a right triangle at X, then angle at A would be 30 degrees, making the other angle at W equal to 60 degrees. 

If that's the case, then angle 1 is 30 degrees, and angle 2 might be related to this. For example, if angle 2 is the angle at A in triangle ZAY, which would also be 30 degrees, but that would make answer A. But the options include 60, so perhaps angle 2 is the other angle in the triangle, which is 60 degrees.

Alternatively, since the triangles are congruent, and angle 1 is 30 degrees, angle 2 could be 60 degrees, as the complement. 

But I need to tie this back to the given information. Let me think about the full structure.

Assuming that triangle WAX is a right triangle with right angle at X, and angle at A is 30 degrees (angle 1), then the remaining angle at W would be 60 degrees. Similarly, in triangle ZAY, angle at A would also be 30 degrees, and angle at Z would be 60 degrees.

Now, looking at the other congruent triangles: Triangle(W,A,Y) ≅ Triangle(X,A,Z). Let's analyze these. If these triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal. Let's say angle at A in both triangles is equal. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, perhaps this relates to other angles.

But without knowing the exact location of angle 2, it's challenging. However, considering the symmetry of the rectangle and the congruent triangles, angle 2 might be the supplement of angle 1, or some combination.

Another approach: since the sum of angles around point A would be 360 degrees. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, and there are other angles formed by the intersection of lines, perhaps angle 2 is supplementary to it.

For example, if two lines intersect at A, creating vertical angles. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, then its vertical angle is also 30 degrees, and the adjacent angles would be 150 degrees. But if angle 2 is one of these, it would be 150, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 2 are part of a triangle. For example, in triangle WAX, if angle at A is 30 degrees, and angle at X is 90 degrees, then angle at W is 60 degrees. If angle 2 is this 60-degree angle, then the answer would be B. 

This seems plausible. So, if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then angle 2 (which might be the other angle in the triangle) would be 60 degrees. Hence, the answer would be B.

Considering the congruent triangles and the right angles in the rectangle, this seems to fit. Thus, the measure of angle 2 is 60 degrees, making the answer B.
