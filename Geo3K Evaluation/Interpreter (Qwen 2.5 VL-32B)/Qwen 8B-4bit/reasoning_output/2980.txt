Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again:

- Circle(X): So there's a circle with center X?
- Point(Z), Point(Y), Point(X): These are points named Z, Y, and X.
- Line(X,Z) and Line(X,Y): Lines connecting X to Z and X to Y.
- IsRadiusOf(Line(X,Z), Circle(X)): This means that the line segment from X to Z is a radius of the circle centered at X. Similarly for Line(X,Y).
- Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(X)), 6): The radius of the circle is 6 units.
- Angle(Z,X,Y): The angle at point X between points Z and Y.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,Y)), 75): The measure of that angle is 75 degrees.
- Arc(Z,Y): There's an arc from Z to Y.

The question asks for the length of arc ZY, rounded to the nearest hundredth. The options are A to D.

First, let me visualize the setup. We have a circle with center X. Points Z and Y are on the circumference because the lines XZ and XY are radii. Therefore, both Z and Y lie on the circle. The angle at X between Z and Y is 75 degrees. That angle is formed by two radii, so it's a central angle. 

In a circle, the measure of a central angle corresponds to the measure of its intercepted arc. So if the central angle is 75 degrees, the arc length should be calculated using the formula for arc length, which is θ times r, where θ is in radians. Wait, but first, I need to confirm whether the angle given is in degrees or radians. Since the problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(...)) equals 75, and typically angles in such problems are in degrees unless stated otherwise, so I'll assume θ is 75 degrees.

But the arc length formula requires θ in radians. So I need to convert 75 degrees to radians. However, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, since the central angle is 75 degrees, the arc length would be (θ/360) * 2πr. Let me check that.

Yes, the arc length formula is (θ/360) × 2πr when θ is in degrees. Alternatively, if θ is in radians, it's just rθ. So first, converting 75 degrees to radians: 75° × π/180 = (5π)/12 radians. Then, multiplying by radius 6 gives 6*(5π/12) = (5π)/2 ≈ 7.85398... which rounds to 7.85. Looking at the options, that's option C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

Wait, the problem says Arc(Z,Y). So the arc from Z to Y. Since Z and Y are points on the circle connected via radii XZ and XY forming a central angle of 75 degrees, the arc ZY is indeed the arc corresponding to that central angle. Hence, the arc length is (75/360)*circumference. Circumference is 2πr = 2π*6=12π. So 75/360 * 12π = (75/30)π = 2.5π. Which is approximately 2.5 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.854, so rounding to two decimal places is 7.85. So answer C. 

Alternatively, using radians: 75 degrees is 5π/12 radians. Multiply by radius 6: 6*(5π/12)= (5π)/2 ≈ 7.85. Same result. So either way, the answer is approximately 7.85, which is option C. Let me check the answer choices again: C is 7.85. So that's the answer. 

I think that's solid. All steps make sense. The key was recognizing that the central angle defines the arc length, converting degrees to radians or using the proportion of the circle. Either method leads to the same calculation.
