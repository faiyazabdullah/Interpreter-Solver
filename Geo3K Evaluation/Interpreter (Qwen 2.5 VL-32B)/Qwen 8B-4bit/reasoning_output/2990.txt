MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle 8, given that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and how they relate to each other.

First, looking at the predicates, there are several lines mentioned: j, m, n, p, q. They also mention some angles like 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8. There are relationships between these lines being parallel and intersecting, and certain angles being corresponding or alternate interior angles. Also, some equality conditions between angles.

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Lines j, m, n, p, q are all parallel? Wait, the Parallel predicates say that Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), Line(m) parallel to Line(n), Line(n) parallel to Line(p), Line(p) parallel to Line(q). So that forms a chain of parallel lines. So, j || m || n || p || q. Therefore, all these lines are parallel to each other. 

Then, there are intersection points. For example, Line(j) and Line(m) intersect at point O, but since they're parallel, wait—no, if two lines are parallel, they shouldn't intersect unless they are the same line. Wait, but here it says IntersectAt(Line(j), Line(m), Line(m), Point(O)). That seems conflicting because if j and m are parallel, they shouldn't intersect. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, perhaps those lines are not all parallel? Let me check again.

Wait, the Parallel predicates state that Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), so they don't intersect. But then the IntersectAt predicate says Line(j) and Line(m) intersect at point O. That's a contradiction. Unless there's a mistake in my understanding. Wait, maybe the lines aren't all parallel? Let me re-examine the given data.

Looking back: The first set of Parallel predicates are:

Parallel(Line(j), Line(m))

Parallel(Line(m), Line(n))

Parallel(Line(n), Line(p))

Parallel(Line(p), Line(q))

So, this implies that j || m, m || n, n || p, p || q. Therefore, all five lines j, m, n, p, q are mutually parallel. However, the IntersectAt(Line(j), Line(m), Line(m), Point(O)) suggests that Line(j) and Line(m) intersect at point O. But if they are parallel, they cannot intersect. This seems contradictory. Maybe there's a typo or misinterpretation?

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are part of a transversal setup where each consecutive pair is parallel, but they are not all the same line. Wait, but if j is parallel to m, and m is parallel to n, etc., then all lines are parallel. But then, how can they intersect? Unless they are different lines, but even so, parallel lines don't intersect. Therefore, there's a conflict here. Wait, maybe the lines are not all straight lines? Or maybe the IntersectAt refers to something else?

Wait, maybe the lines are not all infinite? Like, maybe they are segments? But the problem mentions Line(j), so typically in geometry, lines are infinite. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the lines are arranged such that each subsequent line is parallel to the previous one, but they are not all the same line. So, for example, Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, but they are separate lines. Then, Line(m) and Line(n) are parallel, so Line(n) is parallel to Line(m), hence also parallel to Line(j). Similarly for others. So, all lines are parallel, but each line is distinct. However, if Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, they can't intersect. But the predicate says they do intersect at point O. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the IntersectAt predicate isn't referring to the entire lines, but rather specific segments or parts of the lines? But the problem states Line(j), Line(m), etc., which are full lines. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not all parallel? Let me check again the Parallel predicates. The first three are:

Parallel(Line(j), Line(m))

Parallel(Line(m), Line(n))

Parallel(Line(n), Line(p))

Parallel(Line(p), Line(q))

Therefore, Line(j) || Line(m) || Line(n) || Line(p) || Line(q). So all five lines are parallel. But then, how can Line(j) and Line(m) intersect? That would mean they are not parallel. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not all parallel, but the way they are connected via the Parallel predicates is different. Wait, perhaps the lines are arranged in a way that they form a series of parallel lines with transversals. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the lines are not all parallel to each other, but each consecutive pair is parallel. For example, Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), Line(m) is parallel to Line(n), so Line(j) is parallel to Line(n), and so on. So, the lines could be arranged as a series of parallel lines, each subsequent one parallel to the previous. However, if Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, then they can't intersect. Hence, the IntersectAt(Line(j), Line(m), Line(m), Point(O)) is invalid. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup. But since this is a given, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the lines are arranged in a way that allows them to intersect, even though they are supposed to be parallel. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, but since we have to work with the given predicates, perhaps we should consider that the lines are not all parallel. Wait, but the Parallel predicates explicitly state that they are parallel. 

This seems like a paradox. Let me look at the other predicates. There's CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)), AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)), ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)), CorrespondingAngles(Line(p), Line(q), Angle(7), Angle(8)). 

These angle relationships suggest that lines are cut by transversals, creating corresponding, alternate interior, and consecutive interior angles. For instance, if Line(j) and Line(m) are cut by a transversal, forming corresponding angles. But if they are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal. Similarly, alternate interior angles would be equal, and consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. 

But if Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, then the angles formed by a transversal would follow these rules. However, the fact that they intersect at point O contradicts the parallelism. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem's setup. However, given that we have to use the given predicates, perhaps the problem assumes that despite the Parallel predicates, the lines actually intersect, implying that the Parallel relations may not hold. But that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not all parallel, but the Parallel predicates refer to different pairs. For example, Line(j) || Line(m), Line(m) || Line(n), etc., but that would imply that Line(j) is parallel to Line(n), etc. However, if Line(j) intersects Line(m) at O, then they can't be parallel. So, this seems inconsistent. 

Wait, perhaps the lines are not all straight lines? No, the problem states Line(j), etc., so they should be straight lines. 

This is perplexing. Maybe the problem has a diagram that we don't see, and the IntersectAt indicates that even though the lines are parallel, they are coinciding? But if they are coinciding, then they are not just parallel but the same line. However, if Line(j) and Line(m) are the same line, then their intersection point O would lie along the line. But the problem mentions Line(j) and Line(m) as separate entities. 

Given the confusion, perhaps I need to focus on the angle relationships and ignore the inconsistency. Since the problem gives us specific angle measures and relationships, perhaps the key is to use the angle relationships provided. 

Given that m∠1 = 50° and m∠3 = 60°, find m∠8. 

From the predicates:

- CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)): So ∠1 corresponds to ∠4, meaning they are equal. Hence, m∠4 = m∠1 = 50°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(1))) confirms this.

- AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)): So ∠3 and ∠5 are alternate interior angles, thus equal. Hence, m∠5 = m∠3 = 60°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))) confirms this.

- ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)): These are consecutive interior angles, which are supplementary. So m∠4 + m∠5 = 180°. Let's check if that holds: 50 + 60 = 110 ≠ 180. Wait, that doesn't add up. So this seems contradictory. Because if ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, they should sum to 180°, but according to the given measures, they sum to 110. Which is a problem. 

This suggests that either there's an error in the problem, or I've misunderstood the relationships. 

Wait, but the problem says that Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), 180)). So SumOf(Angle(4)+Angle(5)) equals 180. But earlier, we had m∠4=50° and m∠5=60°, which sums to 110. That's a contradiction. 

Hmm, so this is conflicting. How to resolve this? 

Maybe the angles referred to in the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles are not ∠4 and ∠5? Let me check the predicates again. 

The ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) means that ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles formed by the transversal cutting lines m and n. Therefore, they should be supplementary. But according to the given values, they are 50 and 60, adding to 110. That's impossible. So this must mean that there's an error in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not directly ∠4 and ∠5, but different ones? Let me re-express the given predicates:

- CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)): So ∠1 corresponds to ∠4 → ∠1 ≅ ∠4.

- AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)): ∠3 and ∠5 are alternate interior → ∠3 ≅ ∠5.

- ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)): So ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. 

But if ∠4 is 50° (from ∠1), and ∠5 is 60° (from ∠3), then 50+60=110≠180. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. 

Wait, but the problem says "Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), 180))", which means that ∠4 + ∠5 = 180°. But according to the given measures, ∠4 is 50°, ∠5 is 60°, which adds to 110°, contradicting this. So this is a problem. 

But maybe the angles are not ∠4 and ∠5 but different ones? Let me check the names again. 

Wait, the CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)): So ∠1 corresponds to ∠4. AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)): So ∠3 and ∠5 are alternate interior. ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)): So ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior. 

Thus, ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, which should be supplementary. But according to the given, ∠4 = 50°, ∠5 = 60°, which sum to 110. So this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that either the problem has conflicting information, or there's a mislabeling of angles. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle labels. 

Wait, let's consider that maybe ∠4 and ∠5 are not the ones I thought. For example, if ∠4 is the corresponding angle to ∠1, and ∠5 is the alternate interior angle to ∠3, but then ∠4 and ∠5 are on different transversals? Or perhaps the consecutive interior angles are not ∠4 and ∠5, but other angles? 

Alternatively, maybe the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) refers to angles formed by another transversal. Wait, but the lines m and n are being cut by a transversal, which could be Line(j) or Line(n)? 

Wait, Line(m) and Line(n) are parallel. The transversal cutting them could be Line(j) or Line(n)? Wait, Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), so if Line(j) is a transversal cutting Line(m) and Line(n)? But Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), so if Line(j) intersects Line(m) at O, then Line(j) would be a transversal for Line(m) and Line(n)? Wait, but Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), so Line(j) wouldn't intersect Line(m) unless they are the same line. This is very confusing. 

Perhaps the key is to focus on the given angle measures and the relationships between them, ignoring the contradictions. 

We know that ∠1 = 50°, ∠3 = 60°. From the CorrespondingAngles, ∠4 = ∠1 = 50°. From AlternateInteriorAngles, ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. Now, the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles says ∠4 + ∠5 = 180°, but 50 + 60 = 110, which is not 180. So this is a problem. 

However, the problem also includes another CorrespondingAngles(Line(p), Line(q), Angle(7), Angle(8)), which might be similar to the first one. And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(8)), MeasureOf(Angle(7))). 

Assuming that the pattern continues, maybe ∠7 is corresponding to ∠8, so they are equal. 

Now, the question asks for ∠8. If we can find a relationship involving ∠8, we might be able to compute its measure. 

But how? Let's try to visualize the figure. 

Suppose we have multiple parallel lines, with various transversals. 

For example, Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, intersected by some transversals. Line(m) and Line(n) are parallel, intersected by another transversal, and so on. 

But due to the contradictions earlier, it's hard to imagine. Let's try to focus on the angles given. 

Since ∠4 and ∠5 are supposed to be consecutive interior angles, which sum to 180°, but they are given as 50 and 60. This suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation or mislabeling. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles labeled 4 and 5 are not the ones involved in the consecutive interior angles. Wait, the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) — perhaps Angle(4) and Angle(5) are not the ones we thought. 

Wait, let's think: If Line(m) and Line(n) are parallel, and a transversal cuts them, creating consecutive interior angles. Suppose the transversal is Line(n) itself? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the transversal is Line(j)? If Line(j) intersects Line(m) at O, and Line(j) intersects Line(n) at some point. But Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), so Line(j) can't intersect Line(m) unless it's the same line. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to focus on what's given and derive relationships. 

We have ∠1 = 50°, ∠3 = 60°. 

From CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)), so ∠4 = ∠1 = 50°. 

From AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)), so ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. 

Now, ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) implies ∠4 + ∠5 = 180°, but 50 + 60 = 110. This is a contradiction. But the problem states that Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), 180)), so it's saying that ∠4 + ∠5 = 180. Thus, this must be true. So, this suggests that my earlier assumption about which angles are which is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) refers to different angles than ∠4 and ∠5? Or maybe the angles are not ∠4 and ∠5 but other angles? 

Wait, the problem says: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)), 180)). So the sum of ∠4 and ∠5 is 180. But earlier, we have ∠4 = 50° and ∠5 = 60°, which sum to 110. So this must mean that our earlier assignments are incorrect. 

Therefore, perhaps ∠4 is not equal to ∠1? Or maybe ∠5 is not equal to ∠3? Let me re-examine the predicates. 

The CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)) means that ∠1 and ∠4 are corresponding angles. Since Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel (as per the Parallel predicate), corresponding angles should be equal. Therefore, ∠1 = ∠4. Hence, ∠4 = 50°. 

Similarly, AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)) implies that ∠3 and ∠5 are alternate interior angles, so they should be equal. Hence, ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. 

But then ∠4 + ∠5 = 110, which contradicts the given sum of 180. This suggests that there's an error in the problem or in my interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles referred to in the ConsecutiveInteriorAngles are not ∠4 and ∠5, but other angles. Let me check the names again. 

The ConsecutiveInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(4), Angle(5)) — this specifies that the consecutive interior angles are Angle(4) and Angle(5). But if that's the case, and they are supposed to sum to 180, then with ∠4 = 50 and ∠5 = 60, it's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the sum of ∠4 and ∠5 is 180, leading us to adjust the values. Let me assume that despite the earlier relationships, ∠4 + ∠5 = 180. Given that ∠4 = 50°, then ∠5 = 130°. But this conflicts with the AlternateInteriorAngles stating that ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. So this creates another contradiction. 

This is really confusing. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the lines are not all parallel, and the Parallel predicates were misinterpreted. 

Wait, suppose that Line(j) is parallel to Line(m), Line(m) is parallel to Line(n), etc., but in reality, the lines are arranged in such a way that they form a zigzag pattern, allowing intersections. For example, Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, but Line(m) and Line(n) are not parallel? But the predicate says they are. 

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to focus on the angles and the relationships that can be deduced regardless of the contradictions. 

We know that ∠1 = 50°, ∠3 = 60°. 

From CorrespondingAngles, ∠4 = ∠1 = 50°. 

From AlternateInteriorAngles, ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. 

Even though this leads to a contradiction with the consecutive interior angles, maybe we can proceed. 

Now, looking at the CorrespondingAngles(Line(p), Line(q), Angle(7), Angle(8)), which likely means ∠7 corresponds to ∠8, so they are equal. 

Additionally, the problem asks for ∠8. 

But how does ∠8 relate to the other angles? 

Perhaps there's a transversal connecting these lines, leading to more angle relationships. 

Assume that Line(p) and Line(q) are parallel, and a transversal cuts them, creating corresponding angles ∠7 and ∠8. So ∠7 = ∠8. 

But without knowing ∠7, we can't find ∠8 directly. 

However, maybe there's a way to connect ∠7 to other angles. 

Alternatively, considering the earlier angles, maybe there's a way to find ∠7 using the consecutive interior angles. 

Wait, if ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, but their sum is 180°, and we previously found that ∠4 = 50° and ∠5 = 60°, which doesn't add to 180. But if we force this condition, then ∠4 + ∠5 = 180. Let's say that ∠4 = x and ∠5 = y, with x + y = 180. But we also have that ∠4 = ∠1 = 50°, and ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°, which would require 50 + 60 = 180, which is false. Therefore, this suggests that either ∠4 or ∠5 is not equal to their respective angles. 

Maybe there's a miscalculation in assuming that ∠4 corresponds to ∠1. Let me re-examine the CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)). 

Corresponding angles are equal when two lines are cut by a transversal. Here, Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, and the transversal could be Line(n), or another line. Wait, but if Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, and a transversal crosses both, then corresponding angles would be equal. But which transversal? 

If Line(n) is the transversal, then it would cross Line(j) and Line(m). But Line(n) is parallel to Line(m), so if Line(n) is a transversal for Line(j) and Line(m), then it would create corresponding angles. 

But I'm not sure. This is getting too abstract. 

Perhaps I should consider that the given sum of ∠4 and ∠5 is 180°, which forces us to calculate ∠5 = 180 - ∠4. If ∠4 = 50°, then ∠5 = 130°. But this contradicts the AlternateInteriorAngles stating that ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. So, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, or that my assumptions are wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠5 is not equal to ∠3. Let me recheck the AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)). This would mean that ∠3 and ∠5 are alternate interior angles, hence equal. So ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. 

But if ∠4 + ∠5 = 180, and ∠4 = 50, then ∠5 = 130°, which would make ∠3 = 130°, but the problem states ∠3 = 60°. 

This is a dead end. 

Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the Angle(3) is different. Or maybe the given values are swapped. 

Alternatively, maybe the consecutive interior angles are not ∠4 and ∠5, but other angles. For example, if the transversal is Line(n), then the consecutive interior angles could be ∠5 and another angle. 

This is too ambiguous. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach. 

The question asks for ∠8. From the CorrespondingAngles(Line(p), Line(q), Angle(7), Angle(8)), so ∠7 = ∠8. 

If I can find ∠7, then I can get ∠8. 

How can I find ∠7? Maybe it relates to other angles through the parallel lines. 

Assuming that Line(p) and Line(q) are parallel, and a transversal cuts them, creating corresponding angles ∠7 and ∠8. 

But to find ∠7, perhaps it's related to previous angles. 

If Line(p) is parallel to Line(q), and Line(n) is a transversal, then Line(n) intersects Line(p) and Line(q). 

But Line(n) is parallel to Line(m), and Line(m) is parallel to Line(j). 

Maybe there's a way to trace the angles through the parallel lines. 

For example, if Line(n) intersects Line(p) and Line(q), creating angles that relate to ∠5 or ∠4. 

Alternatively, since Line(n) is parallel to Line(m), and Line(m) was intersected by Line(j), creating angles that include ∠1 and ∠4. 

But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the angles around the intersections might form triangles or other figures. 

But without a diagram, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe the key is to recognize that ∠8 is vertically opposite or supplementary to another angle. 

Alternatively, since ∠8 corresponds to ∠7, and if ∠7 is supplementary to ∠5 or something. 

But this is speculation. 

Given the time I've invested without resolving the contradictions, I'll proceed with the given values, assuming that the sum of ∠4 and ∠5 is 180°, leading to ∠5 = 130°, and then see if that helps. 

If ∠5 = 130°, and since ∠5 is an alternate interior angle to ∠3, then ∠3 = 130°, but the problem states ∠3 = 60°. This doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 = 60°, then ∠5 = 60°, and ∠4 + 60 = 180 ⇒ ∠4 = 120°. But ∠4 corresponds to ∠1, so ∠1 = 120°, but the problem says ∠1 = 50°. 

This is inconsistent. 

Maybe the problem intended that the sum of ∠4 and ∠5 is 180°, and ∠4 = 50°, so ∠5 = 130°, and then ∠5 = ∠3, making ∠3 = 130°, but the problem says ∠3 = 60°. This is conflicting. 

At this point, I think there must be an error in the problem setup, but since I need to provide an answer, I'll try to proceed with the available information. 

Let me consider that the consecutive interior angles ∠4 and ∠5 sum to 180°, and given that ∠4 = 50°, then ∠5 = 130°. Even though this conflicts with the AlternateInteriorAngles, perhaps the AlternateInteriorAngles refer to a different pair. 

If ∠5 = 130°, then since ∠5 is an alternate interior angle to ∠3, ∠3 = 130°, but the problem says ∠3 = 60°. Still inconsistent. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠5 is not the alternate interior angle to ∠3, but to another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the AlternateInteriorAngles(Line(m), Line(n), Angle(3), Angle(5)) refers to ∠3 and ∠5 being alternate interior, so they are equal, hence ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°, and then the consecutive interior angles ∠4 and ∠5 must sum to 180, so ∠4 = 120°. But ∠4 corresponds to ∠1, so ∠1 = 120°, conflicting with the given ∠1 = 50°. 

This suggests that the problem has conflicting information, making it unsolvable as stated. However, since this is a test question, there must be a solution. 

Let me try to ignore the contradictions and proceed with the given values. Assume that ∠4 = 50°, ∠5 = 60°, and despite their sum not being 180, proceed. 

Now, looking at the CorrespondingAngles(Line(p), Line(q), Angle(7), Angle(8)), so ∠7 = ∠8. 

Assuming that Line(p) and Line(q) are parallel, and a transversal creates corresponding angles ∠7 and ∠8. If we can find ∠7, then ∠8 = ∠7. 

To find ∠7, perhaps it is related to ∠5 or ∠4 through the parallel lines. 

For example, if Line(n) is a transversal cutting Line(p) and Line(q), then ∠5 might be related to ∠7. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, consider that the angles around the intersections might form linear pairs or supplementary angles. 

For instance, if ∠5 = 60°, and it's part of a linear pair with another angle, which could be ∠7. 

But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, since Line(p) is parallel to Line(q), and Line(n) is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be equal. If ∠5 is an alternate interior angle to ∠7, then ∠7 = ∠5 = 60°, making ∠8 = 60°. But this would make ∠8 = 60°, which is not among the options (the choices are A. 100, B. 110, C. 120, D. 130). 

Wait, the options are A-D, and the answer choices are 100, 110, 120, 130. 

Alternatively, if ∠8 is supplementary to ∠5, then ∠8 = 180 - 60 = 120°, which is option C. 

But why would ∠8 be supplementary to ∠5? 

If Line(p) and Line(q) are parallel, and a transversal creates angles that are supplementary to ∠5. 

For example, if ∠5 is an angle on one side, and ∠8 is on the other, making them supplementary. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's speculative. 

Another approach: Since ∠1 = 50°, and ∠4 = 50° (corresponding angles), and ∠5 = 60° (alternate interior with ∠3), and assuming that ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, which should sum to 180°, but they don't, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the actual sum is 110°, which would mean that the lines are not parallel, but that's conflicting with the given Parallel predicates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not in the order I thought. For example, if ∠4 is not the corresponding angle to ∠1, but another angle. 

Wait, the CorrespondingAngles(Line(j), Line(m), Angle(1), Angle(4)) means that ∠1 and ∠4 are corresponding angles. So, if Line(j) and Line(m) are parallel, then ∠1 and ∠4 are equal. 

Assuming that, and if ∠4 is 50°, then ∠1 is 50°, which matches. 

Now, if ∠5 is an alternate interior angle to ∠3, then ∠5 = ∠3 = 60°. 

Now, if ∠4 and ∠5 are consecutive interior angles, they should sum to 180. But they sum to 50 + 60 = 110. This suggests that the lines are not parallel, but the problem says they are. 

This contradiction implies that the problem has errors, but assuming that the sum is 180, then ∠4 + ∠5 = 180. If ∠4 = 50°, then ∠5 = 130°. But this contradicts ∠5 = 60°. 

Unless there's a different relationship. For example, if ∠5 is not the alternate interior angle to ∠3, but to another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the alternate interior angles are ∠3 and ∠5, but they are on different transversals. 

This is too uncertain. Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that despite the contradiction, the key is to use the given values and relationships. 

If ∠5 = 60°, and it's an alternate interior angle to ∠3, then ∠3 = 60°, which is given. 

Now, if Line(p) and Line(q) are parallel, and a transversal creates corresponding angles ∠7 and ∠8. If ∠7 is supplementary to ∠5, then ∠7 = 180 - 60 = 120°, making ∠8 = 120°, which is option C. 

Alternatively, if ∠8 is vertical to ∠5, then ∠8 = 60°, but that's not an option. 

Or, if ∠8 is supplementary to ∠5, giving 120°, which is option C. 

Therefore, I'll go with option C, 120°, as the measure of ∠8.
