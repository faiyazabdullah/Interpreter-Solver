Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have several points: B, W, Y, X, Z. There are triangles mentioned: Triangle(B,W,Y) and Triangle(B,X,Z). Also, there's a rectangle W,X,Y,Z. Then there are lines connecting these points, like Line(B,W), Line(B,Y), etc. Angles and perpendicularity are involved too, such as Angle(B,Z,X) being a right angle, and some lines being parallel or perpendicular. Additionally, we know that the length of Line(B,Y) is 12 units. The question asks for X W, which I assume refers to the length of segment XW or maybe the coordinates? Wait, but since it's about finding a numerical value among options A-D, likely it's a length.

Let me try to visualize the diagram based on the given predicates. Starting with the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z). So, W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. That means opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Also, the sides WX and ZY are parallel, and WZ and XY are parallel. Also, the diagonals of the rectangle should be equal. But wait, the problem also mentions lines connecting B to various points. 

Looking at the lines: Line(B,W), Line(B,Y), Line(B,X), Line(B,Z). So point B is connected to all four corners of the rectangle. So B is connected to W, X, Y, Z. Also, there's a triangle B,W,Y and another triangle B,X,Z. Since W,X,Y,Z form a rectangle, then WY and XZ would be diagonals of the rectangle. However, the triangles mentioned are B,W,Y and B,X,Z. So those triangles share the same vertex B and connect to two adjacent corners of the rectangle?

Also, there's a mention of Angle(B,Z,X) being a right angle. So the angle at point Z between points B, Z, X is a right angle. Also, Line(B,X) is perpendicular to Line(W,Z). Since W,Z is one side of the rectangle, and X is another corner. Wait, if W,X,Y,Z is a rectangle, then the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. So Line(W,Z) would be one of the sides? Wait, no. In a rectangle, the sides are consecutive vertices. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal of the rectangle, because connecting W to Z skips the next vertex. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are WY and XZ. So if Line(W,Z) is a diagonal, then perhaps there's a mistake here? Or maybe I misread the connections.

Wait, the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) implies that the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, Line(W,Z) would actually be a diagonal of the rectangle, connecting W to Z, which are opposite corners. Similarly, Line(X,Y) is a side of the rectangle. The problem states that Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). Wait, but if Line(W,Z) is a diagonal of the rectangle and Line(X,Y) is a side, then they can't be parallel unless the rectangle is a square. Because in a general rectangle, the diagonal isn't parallel to the sides. Hmm, so this suggests that maybe the rectangle has some specific proportions.

But also, there's another predicate: Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(Z,Y)). Wait, Line(W,X) is a side of the rectangle, and Line(Z,Y) is another side. Since in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel, so Line(W,X) is parallel to Line(Z,Y), which makes sense. So that checks out. Also, Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y)? Wait, Line(X,Y) is a horizontal side (assuming standard orientation), while Line(W,Z) is a diagonal. Unless the rectangle is degenerate? But that seems unlikely. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe I got the order of the rectangle wrong. The rectangle is defined as W,X,Y,Z. So the order of the points around the rectangle could be W connected to X, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, and Z connected back to W. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal from W to Z, passing through the interior of the rectangle. Now, according to the given predicates, Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). But Line(X,Y) is a side of the rectangle, which is part of the rectangle's structure. For a diagonal to be parallel to a side, the rectangle must have certain properties. For example, in a square, the diagonals are not parallel to the sides. So this suggests that maybe the rectangle is actually a square? Or perhaps there's another configuration.

Wait, but there's also a statement that Line(W,X) is parallel to Line(Z,Y). Which makes sense because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So that's okay. However, Line(W,Z) being parallel to Line(X,Y) would mean that the diagonal is parallel to a side. This seems contradictory unless the rectangle is a very specific shape. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the rectangle is not a standard rectangle but something else. Wait, but rectangles are defined by having all angles 90 degrees and opposite sides equal and parallel. So if Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y), which is a side, then that would imply that Line(W,Z) is parallel to a side of the rectangle. How can a diagonal be parallel to a side? Only if the rectangle is collapsed into a line, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in my understanding of the rectangle's definition.

Wait, maybe the rectangle is named differently. For instance, sometimes rectangles are labeled in order, so that consecutive letters are connected. So W-X-Y-Z-W forms a rectangle. Thus, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. So Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal. So if Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y), then the diagonal is parallel to the side XY. For that to happen, the slope of the diagonal must equal the slope of the side. Let's consider coordinates. Suppose we assign coordinates to these points. Let me try assigning coordinates to make this work.

Let me assume that point W is at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose X is at (a,0), Y is at (a,b), and Z is at (0,b). Then, the sides are WX from (0,0) to (a,0); XY from (a,0) to (a,b); YZ from (a,b) to (0,b); and ZW from (0,b) to (0,0). Wait, but that would make ZW go from (0,b) to (0,0), which is vertical. But in this case, Line(W,Z) would be from (0,0) to (0,b), which is vertical. Line(X,Y) is from (a,0) to (a,b), which is also vertical. So in this case, Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are both vertical, hence parallel. Oh! So in this coordinate system, they are parallel. Therefore, the rectangle is axis-aligned, and the diagonal WZ is actually a vertical line if the rectangle is aligned with axes. Wait, no. Wait, in this setup, W is (0,0), Z is (0,b). So WZ is vertical. And XY is vertical as well. Therefore, they are parallel. So that works. So the rectangle is axis-aligned, with sides horizontal and vertical. Therefore, the diagonals are from W(0,0) to Y(a,b) and from X(a,0) to Z(0,b).

So in this case, Line(W,Z) is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,b)), and Line(X,Y) is vertical (from (a,0) to (a,b)), hence parallel. That fits the given predicate Parallel(Line(W,Z), Line(X,Y)).

Now, considering other predicates. There's a RightAngle(Angle(B,Z,X)). So the angle at point Z between points B, Z, X is a right angle. Also, Perpendicular(Line(B,X), Line(W,Z)). Since Line(W,Z) is vertical (as per our coordinate system), then Line(B,X) must be horizontal. Because if Line(W,Z) is vertical, then a line perpendicular to it would be horizontal. So Line(B,X) is horizontal. 

Additionally, there's a Triangle(B,X,Z) and Triangle(B,W,Y). Also, the triangles are said to be Similar: Similar(Triangle(B,X,Z), Triangle(B,W,Y)). So these two triangles are similar. Also, Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)). Since Line(W,Z) is vertical with length b (in our coordinate system), and Line(Z,Y) connects Z(0,b) to Y(a,b), which is horizontal, length a. Therefore, Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)) implies that their lengths are equal, so b = a. Hence, the rectangle is a square? Wait, no, because if a = b, then the rectangle becomes a square. But in that case, all sides are equal. However, the problem says it's a rectangle, which includes squares, so that's acceptable.

So, assuming that a = b, making the rectangle a square. Now, looking at the triangles. Triangle(B,X,Z): points B, X(a,0), Z(0,b). But since a = b, say a = b = k. So Z is (0,k), X is (k,0). Triangle(B,X,Z) has vertices at B, (k,0), (0,k). Similarly, Triangle(B,W,Y): W is (0,0), Y is (k,k). So Triangle(B,W,Y) has vertices at B, (0,0), (k,k). These two triangles are similar. Let's check similarity. 

For similarity, corresponding angles must be equal, and sides proportional. Let's see. Let me find coordinates for B. We have lines from B to W, X, Y, Z. Given that Line(B,W), Line(B,Y), Line(B,X), Line(B,Z) exist. Also, Line(B,X) is horizontal, as established earlier. So Line(B,X) is horizontal. Since X is (k,0), and Line(B,X) is horizontal, then B must lie somewhere along the horizontal line passing through X. Wait, but Line(B,X) is horizontal, meaning that B has the same y-coordinate as X. Since X is at (k,0), then B is at some point (p, 0), but since Line(B,X) is horizontal, and X is (k,0), then B must be on the x-axis. Wait, but then Line(B,W) connects B to W(0,0). If B is on the x-axis, then Line(B,W) would be from (p,0) to (0,0), which is along the x-axis. But there's also Line(B,Y), which connects B to Y(k,k). Also, Line(B,Z) connects B to Z(0,k). 

But there's also the Angle(B,Z,X) being a right angle. Let's consider that. Point Z is (0,k), X is (k,0), and B is some point. The angle at Z between B, Z, X is a right angle. So vectors ZB and ZX are perpendicular. Vector ZB is from Z(0,k) to B(p,0): (p - 0, 0 - k) = (p, -k). Vector ZX is from Z(0,k) to X(k,0): (k - 0, 0 - k) = (k, -k). Their dot product should be zero for perpendicularity. So:

(p)(k) + (-k)(-k) = pk + k² = 0 → pk + k² = 0 → p = -k. 

Therefore, B is at (-k, 0). 

So B is at (-k, 0). Let me verify this. 

So B is (-k, 0). Then Line(B,X) is from (-k, 0) to (k, 0), which is horizontal, confirming that it's perpendicular to Line(W,Z) which is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,k)). 

Now, let's look at Triangle(B,X,Z). Points B(-k,0), X(k,0), Z(0,k). Let's compute its sides. 

BX length: distance between (-k,0) and (k,0) is 2k. 
XZ length: distance between (k,0) and (0,k) is sqrt((k)^2 + (k)^2) = k√2. 
BZ length: distance between (-k,0) and (0,k) is sqrt((k)^2 + (k)^2) = k√2. 

So Triangle(B,X,Z) has sides of 2k, k√2, k√2. It's an isoceles triangle with base 2k and equal sides k√2. 

Similarly, Triangle(B,W,Y): points B(-k,0), W(0,0), Y(k,k). 

BW length: distance between (-k,0) and (0,0) is k. 
BY length: distance between (-k,0) and (k,k): sqrt((2k)^2 + (k)^2) = sqrt(4k² + k²) = sqrt(5k²) = k√5. 
WY length: distance between (0,0) and (k,k) is k√2. 

Wait, but the problem states that the triangles are similar. Let me check if the ratios correspond. 

For Triangle(B,X,Z): sides are 2k, k√2, k√2. 

For Triangle(B,W,Y): sides are k, k√5, k√2. 

Wait, for similarity, the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal. Let's see. 

Assuming correspondence between Triangle(B,X,Z) and Triangle(B,W,Y). Let me see which sides correspond. Since both triangles share the vertex B. 

In Triangle(B,X,Z), the sides are BX, XZ, and BZ. 

In Triangle(B,W,Y), the sides are BW, WY, and BY. 

Assuming similarity via AA (angle-angle), but given that they are similar, there must be proportionality. 

But comparing the sides:

Suppose the correspondence is BX corresponds to BW, XZ corresponds to WY, and BZ corresponds to BY. 

Then the ratios would be BX/BW = XZ/WY = BZ/BY. 

Compute BX/BW: (2k)/k = 2. 

XZ/WY: (k√2)/(k√2) = 1. 

These are unequal, so that correspondence doesn't hold. 

Alternative correspondence: Maybe BX corresponds to WY, XZ corresponds to BY, and BZ corresponds to BW. 

Then ratios: BX/WY = XZ/BY = BZ/BW. 

BX/WY: (2k)/(k√2) = 2/√2 = √2. 

XZ/BY: (k√2)/(k√5) = √2 / √5. Not equal to √2. So nope. 

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption of the rectangle being a square may not hold, or perhaps there's a different correspondence. Alternatively, maybe the similarity is in a different way. 

Wait, but the problem states that the triangles are similar: Similar(Triangle(B,X,Z), Triangle(B,W,Y)). So regardless of correspondence, there must be a similarity transformation mapping one to the other. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar via rotation or reflection. Let me calculate the angles. 

In Triangle(B,X,Z): Let's compute the angles. 

Since it's isoceles with sides k√2, k√2, and 2k. The apex angle is at X, between the two equal sides. Wait, no. Wait, the sides are BX=2k, XZ=k√2, BZ=k√2. So the triangle has two equal sides: XZ and BZ. So the apex is at Z. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Points B(-k,0), X(k,0), Z(0,k). So the triangle has vertices at B, X, Z. The sides:

- Between B and X: length 2k.

- Between X and Z: sqrt(k² + k²) = k√2.

- Between Z and B: sqrt(k² + k²) = k√2.

So it's an isoceles triangle with legs XZ and BZ, and base BX. Therefore, the apex angle is at Z. 

In Triangle(B,W,Y): points B(-k,0), W(0,0), Y(k,k). 

The sides:

- BW: from B to W: length k.

- WY: from W to Y: sqrt(k² + k²) = k√2.

- BY: from B to Y: sqrt((2k)^2 + (k)^2) = sqrt(5k²) = k√5.

So the triangle has sides k, k√2, k√5. 

To check similarity, the ratios of the sides must be consistent. Let's arrange them in order. 

First triangle (B,X,Z): sides are k√2, k√2, 2k. Let's write them in increasing order: 2k, k√2, k√2. Wait, 2k vs. k√2: since √2 ≈ 1.414, so 2k > k√2. So ordering is 2k, k√2, k√2. 

Second triangle (B,W,Y): sides are k, k√2, k√5. Ordered: k, k√2, k√5. 

For similarity, the ratios between corresponding sides must be equal. Let's see if there exists a scaling factor λ such that:

Side1/side1' = Side2/side2' = Side3/side3'.

Let me compare the largest sides first. 

In first triangle, largest side is 2k; second triangle's largest is k√5. So if 2k = λ * k√5 ⇒ λ = 2 / √5.

Check if the next sides match. 

In first triangle, next side is k√2. In second triangle, next side is k√2. So if we take the same λ = 2 / √5, then the second triangle's side k√2 would correspond to first triangle's side k√2 scaled by λ. Wait, no. The idea is that the ratios between corresponding sides should be the same. 

But if we pair the largest sides, then the middle sides would be:

First triangle's middle side: k√2. Second triangle's middle side: k√2. 

So the ratio between first triangle's middle side and second triangle's middle side would be (k√2) / (k√2) = 1. But the ratio between the largest sides was 2 / √5. So unless 2 / √5 equals 1, which it doesn't, the similarity fails. 

This suggests that my assumption that a = b (the rectangle is a square) is incorrect. Therefore, there must be a different relationship between a and b. 

Let me re-examine the congruence predicate: Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)). Line(W,Z) is from W(0,0) to Z(0,b), which has length b. Line(Z,Y) is from Z(0,b) to Y(a,b), which has length a. So congruence implies that a = b. Wait, but earlier that led to inconsistency in the triangle similarity. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Ah, wait. The problem says Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)). So their lengths are equal. Therefore, |WZ| = |ZY|. From earlier, |WZ| is b, |ZY| is a. Therefore, a = b. Hence, the rectangle must be a square. But then why does the triangle similarity not hold? 

Maybe my coordinate assignment is flawed. Let me try again with a = b, but adjust B's position. Earlier, I found that B must be at (-k, 0) where k = a = b. Let me recalculate the triangles with this setup.

With a = b = k, points:

W(0,0), X(k,0), Y(k,k), Z(0,k). B(-k,0).

Triangle(B,X,Z): points B(-k,0), X(k,0), Z(0,k).

Calculating the sides:

BX: distance between B and X: sqrt[(k - (-k))^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(2k)^2] = 2k.

XZ: distance between X(k,0) and Z(0,k): sqrt[k^2 + k^2] = k√2.

BZ: distance between B(-k,0) and Z(0,k): sqrt[(0 - (-k))^2 + (k - 0)^2] = sqrt[k^2 + k^2] = k√2.

So triangle sides: 2k, k√2, k√2.

Triangle(B,W,Y): points B(-k,0), W(0,0), Y(k,k).

BW: distance between B and W: sqrt[(0 - (-k))^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = k.

WY: distance between W(0,0) and Y(k,k): sqrt[(k)^2 + (k)^2] = k√2.

BY: distance between B(-k,0) and Y(k,k): sqrt[(k - (-k))^2 + (k - 0)^2] = sqrt[(2k)^2 + k^2] = sqrt(4k² + k²) = sqrt(5k²) = k√5.

So triangle sides: k, k√2, k√5.

Now, for these triangles to be similar, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal. Let me see if there's a common ratio. 

Suppose the triangles are similar with scale factor λ. So the sides of the first triangle (2k, k√2, k√2) must be proportional to the sides of the second triangle (k, k√2, k√5). 

Let me attempt to find a ratio. Let's assume that the longest side of the first triangle (which is 2k) corresponds to the longest side of the second triangle (k√5). So:

2k / (k√5) = λ → λ = 2 / √5.

Then, the next sides should also satisfy this ratio. Take the second-longest side of the first triangle: k√2. Its corresponding side in the second triangle would be k√2. So:

k√2 / (k√2) = 1. But λ is supposed to be 2/√5 ≈ 0.894, which is not equal to 1. Contradiction. 

Hmm, this suggests that the triangles cannot be similar under this setup. But the problem states that they are similar. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my assumptions. Perhaps the correspondence of sides is different?

Let me try pairing the sides differently. Maybe the side BX (2k) in the first triangle corresponds to the side WY (k√2) in the second triangle. Then:

2k / (k√2) = 2 / √2 = √2. 

Then, the next sides: XZ (k√2) in first triangle corresponds to BY (k√5) in second triangle. So k√2 / (k√5) = √(2/5). But √2 ≠ √(2/5), so not equal. 

Another possibility: Maybe the side BZ (k√2) corresponds to the side BW (k) in the second triangle. Then:

k√2 / k = √2. 

And the other sides: BX (2k) corresponds to WY (k√2). So 2k / (k√2) = 2 / √2 = √2. Then, the remaining side: XZ (k√2) corresponds to BY (k√5). So k√2 / (k√5) = √(2/5). Again, inconsistent. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction, implying that my earlier assumption that a = b is wrong. But the problem says that Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)), so their lengths must be equal, hence a = b. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correspondence of the triangles. Let me think again about the similarity. Maybe the triangles are similar in a different way, such as having angles matching. 

Let me calculate the angles of both triangles. 

Starting with Triangle(B,X,Z):

It's an isoceles triangle with sides 2k, k√2, k√2. Let's find the angles. Using the Law of Cosines. 

At point Z: The angle between sides ZB and ZX. 

Using Law of Cosines:

cos(theta) = (ZB² + ZX² - BX²) / (2 * ZB * ZX)

Plugging in:

ZB = k√2, ZX = k√2, BX = 2k.

So cos(theta) = [(k√2)^2 + (k√2)^2 - (2k)^2] / (2 * k√2 * k√2) 

Calculate numerator:

2k² + 2k² - 4k² = 0. 

So cos(theta) = 0 → theta = 90 degrees. So angle at Z is 90 degrees. 

Which aligns with the given RightAngle(Angle(B,Z,X)), which is the angle at Z between B, Z, X. So that checks out. 

So Triangle(B,X,Z) is a right isoceles triangle with right angle at Z. 

Now, Triangle(B,W,Y): Let's find its angles. 

Its sides are k, k√2, k√5. Let's use Law of Cosines to find angles. 

First, identify which angle is right. Check if Pythagorean theorem holds. 

Is k² + (k√2)^2 = (k√5)^2? 

Left side: k² + 2k² = 3k². Right side: 5k². Not equal. So no right angle here. 

So this triangle is not a right triangle. 

But Triangle(B,X,Z) is a right triangle. For them to be similar, Triangle(B,W,Y) must also have a right angle. But according to the calculation, it doesn't. So this suggests a contradiction, meaning there's an error in my previous assumptions. 

Where did I go wrong? Let me revisit the problem. 

The problem says that the triangles are similar: Similar(Triangle(B,X,Z), Triangle(B,W,Y)). Also, we have a RightAngle(Angle(B,Z,X)), which is the right angle in Triangle(B,X,Z). Therefore, Triangle(B,W,Y) must also have a right angle. 

So, there must be a right angle in Triangle(B,W,Y). Where is it? 

Looking at Triangle(B,W,Y): points B(-k,0), W(0,0), Y(k,k). Let's check the angles. 

Compute the slopes of the sides to see if any are perpendicular. 

Slope of BW: from B(-k,0) to W(0,0): rise over run is (0-0)/(0 - (-k)) = 0/k = 0. So horizontal line. 

Slope of WY: from W(0,0) to Y(k,k): slope is (k-0)/(k-0) = 1. 

Slope of BY: from B(-k,0) to Y(k,k): slope is (k-0)/(k - (-k)) = k/(2k) = 1/2. 

So, the angle at W: between BW (slope 0) and WY (slope 1). The product of slopes is 0*1 = 0, which indicates that they are perpendicular only if one is vertical and the other is horizontal. But here, one is horizontal (slope 0), the other is slope 1, so not perpendicular. 

Angle at Y: between WY (slope 1) and BY (slope 1/2). The product of slopes is 1*(1/2) = 1/2, not -1, so not perpendicular. 

Angle at B: between WB (slope 0) and BY (slope 1/2). Product of slopes is 0 * 1/2 = 0, so not perpendicular. 

Wait, this suggests that Triangle(B,W,Y) doesn't have a right angle. But it should, since it's similar to Triangle(B,X,Z), which has a right angle. This is a contradiction. 

This implies that my earlier assumption about the position of B is incorrect. Let me re-examine the earlier steps. 

Earlier, I assumed that B is at (-k, 0) because of the perpendicularity condition between Line(B,X) and Line(W,Z). Let me recheck that. 

Given that Line(B,X) is perpendicular to Line(W,Z). Line(W,Z) is vertical (since W(0,0) to Z(0,k)), so Line(W,Z) is vertical. Therefore, Line(B,X) must be horizontal. Since X is at (k,0), Line(B,X) is horizontal. So B must lie on the horizontal line passing through X, which is the x-axis. So B has coordinates (p, 0). 

But earlier, I determined that due to the right angle at Z, B must be at (-k, 0). Let me verify that again. 

Angle(B,Z,X) is a right angle. So vectors ZB and ZX are perpendicular. 

Vector ZB: from Z(0,k) to B(p,0): (p - 0, 0 - k) = (p, -k). 

Vector ZX: from Z(0,k) to X(k,0): (k - 0, 0 - k) = (k, -k). 

Their dot product is (p)(k) + (-k)(-k) = pk + k². For perpendicularity, this must be zero: pk + k² = 0 → p = -k. So yes, B is at (-k, 0). 

Thus, B is at (-k, 0). 

Now, with this, Triangle(B,W,Y) has no right angle, contradicting the similarity requirement. So there must be another error. 

Wait, perhaps the similarity is not between the right angle and another angle? Or maybe the correspondence is different. Let me try to find if there's a right angle in Triangle(B,W,Y). 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slopes. Let me recalculate the slopes. 

Point B(-k,0), W(0,0), Y(k,k). 

Slope of BW: from B to W: (0 - 0)/(0 - (-k)) = 0/k = 0. Correct. 

Slope of BY: from B(-k,0) to Y(k,k): (k - 0)/(k - (-k)) = k/(2k) = 1/2. Correct. 

Slope of WY: from W(0,0) to Y(k,k): (k - 0)/(k - 0) = 1. Correct. 

So the angles are not right. So where is the mistake? 

Perhaps the triangles are similar in a way that one of their angles corresponds to the right angle. For example, if Triangle(B,X,Z) has a right angle at Z, then Triangle(B,W,Y) must have a right angle at one of its vertices. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the angles. Let me use the Law of Cosines for Triangle(B,W,Y). 

Sides: BW = k, WY = k√2, BY = k√5. 

Check if any angle is right. 

For angle at W: sides BW = k, WY = k√2, and opposite side is BY = k√5. 

Law of Cosines: (BY)^2 = (BW)^2 + (WY)^2 - 2*BW*WY*cos(angle at W). 

So (k√5)^2 = k^2 + (k√2)^2 - 2*k*(k√2)*cos(angle at W). 

Left side: 5k². Right side: k² + 2k² - 2*k*k√2 * cos(angle) = 3k² - 2k²√2 cos(angle). 

Setting equal: 5k² = 3k² - 2k²√2 cos(angle). Rearranged: 2k² = -2k²√2 cos(angle) → cos(angle) = -1/√2. So angle is 135 degrees. 

Similarly, check angle at B: sides BW = k, BY = k√5, opposite side WY = k√2. 

Law of Cosines: (WY)^2 = (BW)^2 + (BY)^2 - 2*BW*BY*cos(angle at B). 

(k√2)^2 = k² + (k√5)^2 - 2*k*(k√5)*cos(angle). 

Left side: 2k². Right side: k² + 5k² - 2k²√5 cos(angle) = 6k² - 2k²√5 cos(angle). 

Equation: 2k² = 6k² - 2k²√5 cos(angle) → -4k² = -2k²√5 cos(angle) → cos(angle) = 2/√5 ≈ 0.894. So angle is arccos(2/√5) ≈ 26.565 degrees. 

Angle at Y: remaining angle. Sum of angles is 180. 135 + 26.565 = 161.565, so remaining angle is ~18.435 degrees. 

So Triangle(B,W,Y) has angles of 135°, 26.565°, and 18.435°. 

Triangle(B,X,Z) has a right angle at Z (90°), and the other two angles: let's calculate them. 

In Triangle(B,X,Z), sides are 2k, k√2, k√2. 

Using Law of Cosines for angle at X: 

Opposite side is BZ = k√2. 

Law of Cosines: (BZ)^2 = (BX)^2 + (XZ)^2 - 2*BX*XZ*cos(angle at X). 

(k√2)^2 = (2k)^2 + (k√2)^2 - 2*2k*k√2*cos(angle at X). 

Left: 2k². Right: 4k² + 2k² - 4k²√2 cos(angle) = 6k² - 4k²√2 cos(angle). 

Set equal: 2k² = 6k² - 4k²√2 cos(angle) → -4k² = -4k²√2 cos(angle) → cos(angle) = 1/√2 → angle = 45°. 

So the triangle has angles: 90°, 45°, 45°. 

So Triangle(B,X,Z) is a right isoceles triangle. 

Triangle(B,W,Y) has angles 135°, 26.565°, 18.435°. 

For similarity, the angles must match. But these don't match. Hence, there's a contradiction. This suggests that my initial assumption about the rectangle being a square is incorrect, despite the Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)) predicate. 

Wait, but Congruent(Line(W,Z), Line(Z,Y)) means their lengths are equal, so |WZ| = |ZY|. As before, |WZ| is b (if W is (0,0) and Z is (0,b)), and |ZY| is a (from Z(0,b) to Y(a,b)). Hence, a = b. So the rectangle is a square. But this leads to inconsistency in triangle similarity. 

What's the resolution here? Perhaps there's a miscalculation in the similarity? Let me try to see if the triangles are similar in terms of side ratios. 

Triangle(B,X,Z) has sides 2k, k√2, k√2. 

Triangle(B,W,Y) has sides k, k√2, k√5. 

Let me check if there's a common ratio. Let's divide the sides of the first triangle by the second triangle's sides. 

For example, take the first triangle's sides divided by the second triangle's sides:

2k / k = 2, k√2 / k√2 = 1, k√2 / k√5 = √(2/5). 

Not consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar with a different correspondence. Suppose the right angle in Triangle(B,X,Z) corresponds to the 135° angle in Triangle(B,W,Y)? No, because similarity requires corresponding angles to be equal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the similarity is not direct, but involves flipping or rotating. However, even with that, the angles must match. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the current setup. Let me try to approach the problem from another angle, using the given predicates without assuming coordinates. 

Given that Triangles(B,X,Z) and (B,W,Y) are similar, and that Line(W,Z) is congruent to Line(Z,Y), which implies |WZ| = |ZY|. Also, Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y), which in the rectangle implies that Line(W,Z) is a side or diagonal. Wait, earlier we thought it was a diagonal, but if it's parallel to Line(X,Y), which is a side, then in a rectangle, this would require that the diagonal is parallel to a side, which is only possible if the rectangle is degenerate, but that's impossible. 

Wait, perhaps Line(W,Z) is not a diagonal but a side? Let me reconsider the rectangle structure. 

The rectangle is defined as W,X,Y,Z. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So Line(W,Z) is a diagonal, as previously thought. But if it's parallel to Line(X,Y), which is a side, then this can only happen if the rectangle is a square? No, because in a square, the diagonal is not parallel to the sides. 

Wait, unless the rectangle is a square and Line(W,Z) is considered as a side? No, because in a square, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals are WY and XZ. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given predicates, which is unlikely. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption in setting up the coordinates. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's focus on the given information step by step, without assigning coordinates. 

We have a rectangle WXYZ (assuming the rectangle is named W,X,Y,Z in order). So opposite sides are equal and parallel. 

Lines: Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). Since Line(X,Y) is a side of the rectangle, and Line(W,Z) is either a side or diagonal. If it's a diagonal, then it can't be parallel to a side unless it's a square, but that doesn't work. If it's a side, then Line(W,Z) would be a side, but in the rectangle, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal, not a side. 

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Maybe it's W, X, Z, Y? No, the predicate says Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), so the order is W, X, Y, Z. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(W,Z) is a side? Let me think: if the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z, then Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal if it goes from W to Z. But if the rectangle is labeled in a different way, like W, X, Z, Y, then Line(W,Z) would be a side. 

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, forming a rectangle where W is connected to X and Y, and X is connected to W and Z, etc. But this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to use vector approaches. 

Let me denote vectors. Let me assume that the rectangle has sides WX and WZ. So, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So vectors WX and WZ are perpendicular. 

Given that Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). Since Line(X,Y) is a side of the rectangle, which is parallel to WX (because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel). Wait, Line(X,Y) is parallel to Line(WZ)? No, in a rectangle, Line(X,Y) is parallel to Line(WZ)? Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So Line(X,Y) is parallel to Line(WZ)? Let me confirm. 

If the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z, then Line(X,Y) is one side, and Line(W,Z) is the opposite side? No, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are WX || YZ and XY || WZ. So Line(X,Y) is parallel to Line(W,Z). Yes! Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So Line(X,Y) is parallel to Line(W,Z), which matches the given predicate. 

Ah! Here's the mistake earlier: I incorrectly identified Line(W,Z) as a diagonal, but in reality, in the rectangle W,X,Y,Z, Line(W,Z) is one of the opposite sides. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

In a rectangle, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. So Line(W,Z) is not a side, but a diagonal. Wait, no. If the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z-W, then the sides are W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to W. So Line(W,Z) is from W to Z, skipping X and Y, which makes it a diagonal. 

But the given predicate says Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). In a rectangle, Line(X,Y) is a side, and Line(W,Z) is a diagonal. These can't be parallel unless the rectangle is degenerate. 

This contradiction implies that there's an error in the problem statement or my interpretation. But since it's a math problem, it must be solvable, so I must have made a wrong assumption. 

Let me try to re-express the rectangle. Perhaps the rectangle is not labeled sequentially. Maybe it's W, X, Y, Z arranged such that Line(W,Z) is a side. For example, if the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z, but arranged such that W is connected to X and Z, and X is connected to W and Y, Y to X and Z, and Z to Y and W. In this case, Line(W,Z) would be a side if the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z in a different order. 

For example, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then the sides would be W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. In this case, Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal, but Line(X,Y) would be from X to Y, which is a side. Still, Line(W,Z) would be a diagonal, not parallel to Line(X,Y). 

This suggests that the only way for Line(W,Z) to be parallel to Line(X,Y) is if Line(W,Z) is a side, which would mean that the rectangle is labeled in a way that Line(W,Z) is a side. For example, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then Line(W,Z) is a side if it's W to Z, but then Line(X,Y) would be another side. 

Wait, let's try this: Assume the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, with sides W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. Then Line(W,Z) is a diagonal from W to Z, and Line(X,Y) is a side from X to Y. Still, they wouldn't be parallel. 

I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should abandon the coordinate system and focus on the given relationships. 

We know that Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y), and Line(W,X) is parallel to Line(Z,Y). This implies that the rectangle has opposite sides parallel, which is true. But Line(W,Z) being parallel to Line(X,Y) suggests that Line(W,Z) is a side parallel to Line(X,Y), which would mean that Line(W,Z) is a side. But in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So Line(W,Z) must be parallel to Line(X,Y), which would mean that Line(W,Z) is a side parallel to Line(X,Y). Therefore, Line(W,Z) is a side, and Line(X,Y) is the opposite side. 

This implies that Line(W,Z) is a side of the rectangle, so the rectangle has sides WZ and XY. Therefore, the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z arranged such that WZ and XY are opposite sides. 

In this case, the rectangle has sides WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Wait, if WZ is a side, then the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z arranged as W connected to X and Z, X connected to W and Y, Y connected to X and Z, and Z connected to Y and W. This would form a parallelogram, but since it
