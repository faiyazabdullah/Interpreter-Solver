Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for Z X, given some equations involving ZP and PY. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, there's a rectangle WXYZ. That means all the angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. The points W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. Then there are several lines mentioned: Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,W). Also, Line(Z,Y) and Line(W,Y) are mentioned. Wait, but since it's a rectangle, the sides should be connected properly. Maybe I need to visualize the rectangle.

In a rectangle, adjacent corners are connected by sides. So if we have points W, X, Y, Z arranged such that W is connected to X and Z, X is connected to Y and W, Y is connected to Z and X, and Z is connected to Y and W. But the lines given also include Line(Z,Y) and Line(W,Y). Hmm, maybe Y is connected to Z and W? Wait, in a rectangle, each corner has two adjacent sides. For example, point Y would be connected to X and Z. Wait, but Line(Z,Y) is one side, and Line(W,Y) is another? Wait, that might mean that Y is connected to both Z and W, making it a diagonal? No, because in a rectangle, diagonals aren't sides. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the given predicates include Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), so the rectangle is named with those four points. Then, Point(P) is another point. There's Line(Z,Y), Line(W,Y), Line(Z,P), Line(P,Y). Oh, so P is a point connected to Z and Y. Also, there are RightAngle predicates for angles at W, Z, Y, X, etc. So maybe the rectangle has certain angles, and then there's a line from Z to Y, which is a side, and another line from W to Y, which might be a diagonal?

Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. However, the problem mentions RightAngle(Angle(W,Z,Y)). Let me parse that. Angle at point Z between points W, Z, Y. So that would be angle WZY. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so that angle should be 90 degrees. Similarly, other angles are right angles.

Now, looking at the length equalities. The first equality says Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))). Since ZY is a side of the rectangle, and WX is another side. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so ZY equals WX. Similarly, another equality says Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))). Wait, Line(W,Y) is from W to Y. But in a rectangle, W and Y are opposite corners, so that's a diagonal. Therefore, the length of ZY (a side) equals the length of WY (a diagonal)? That seems odd unless the rectangle is a square. Wait, but maybe there's more to it.

But wait, the third equality says Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,Y)))). So ZY equals ZP + PY. And they give expressions for ZP and PY in terms of x: ZP is 4x - 9 and PY is 2x + 5. So adding them gives ZY = (4x -9) + (2x +5) = 6x -4. 

Also, since ZY is a side of the rectangle, and in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. But also, from the earlier equality, ZY equals WX, which is another side. However, another equality states that LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,Y)), which is the diagonal. Wait, that would imply that the side ZY equals the diagonal WY. Which can only happen if the rectangle is degenerate, but that doesn't make sense. Unless there's something wrong here.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine the given predicates. The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,Y)))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), 4*x - 9) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Y)), 2*x + 5)"

So, Line(Z,Y) is equal in length to Line(W,X) and to Line(W,Y). Wait, that suggests that Line(W,Y) (the diagonal) is equal in length to Line(Z,Y) (a side). Which would mean that the diagonal equals the side length, implying that the rectangle is actually a square? Because in a square, the diagonal is sqrt(2) times the side. But here, the diagonal equals the side, so that's only possible if the side is zero, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicates. Let me check again. The second equality is Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))). Wait, Line(W,Y) could be a different line. Wait, in a rectangle, W and Y are opposite corners, so Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. But if ZY is a side, then how can ZY equal the diagonal? This seems contradictory unless the rectangle is degenerate. Perhaps there's a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not a standard rectangle? Or perhaps the points are labeled differently. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the rectangle is WXYZ, with W connected to X and Z, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, and Z connected back to W. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Then, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. So Line(W,Y) is one diagonal, and Line(X,Z) is the other. 

But according to the given predicates, Line(Z,Y) is a side (YZ), and it's equal in length to Line(W,Y), which is the diagonal. So that implies that the length of the side YZ equals the length of the diagonal WY. Which would require that the rectangle has sides where the diagonal equals the side. Which is impossible unless the rectangle is degenerate. Hence, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps Line(W,Y) is not the diagonal. Let me check the points again. Points W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. Let me imagine the rectangle with points in order W, X, Y, Z. So if you go around the rectangle, the sides are W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. Then, the diagonals would be W-Y and X-Z. So Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. But according to the given predicate, Line(Z,Y) is a side (since Z is connected to Y), and Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. So the equality says that the length of the side ZY equals the length of the diagonal WY. Which again seems impossible unless the rectangle is degenerate.

This suggests that maybe the rectangle is actually a square? But even then, the diagonal would be longer than the side. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle has sides of length a and b, and the diagonal is sqrt(a² + b²). So if ZY (side) equals diagonal, then a = sqrt(a² + b²), leading to b=0, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the given predicates. Let me check again. The second equality is Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))). Is Line(W,Y) really the diagonal? Let me consider the possibility that the labeling of the rectangle is different. Maybe the rectangle is not ordered W, X, Y, Z sequentially. For example, maybe it's W, X, Z, Y? Or some other order? Let me think. If the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z, then the connections are W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. But maybe the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, so that the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. In that case, Line(Z,Y) would be a side, and Line(W,Y) would be another side? Wait, no. If the rectangle is W connected to X and Y, X connected to Z, Z connected to Y, and Y connected to W? That would make a different shape. Maybe the rectangle is not convex? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is defined with points W, X, Y, Z such that Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,W) are the sides, forming a rectangle. Then, the diagonals would be WY and XZ. Now, the given predicate includes Line(Z,Y), which would be a side if Z is connected to Y. Wait, but in a rectangle, each vertex connects to two others. So for example, if the rectangle is W connected to X and Z, X connected to W and Y, Y connected to X and Z, Z connected to Y and W. Then, Line(Z,Y) would be a side (from Z to Y), and Line(W,Y) would be a diagonal (from W to Y). So the equality between Length(ZY) and Length(WY) would imply that the side equals the diagonal, which still seems impossible. 

This contradiction suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the given predicates. Alternatively, maybe Line(W,Y) is not a diagonal but another side. Let me think again. Suppose the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z arranged such that W is connected to X and Y, X is connected to W and Z, Y is connected to W and Z, and Z is connected to X and Y. Wait, that would make a diamond shape, like a rhombus, but with right angles. But that's a square. In that case, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal. But then, if ZY is a side, and WY is another side, then they would be equal. Wait, but in that case, Line(Z,Y) would be a side, and Line(W,Y) would be another side? For example, if W and Y are adjacent vertices. Wait, but in a square, each vertex is connected to two others. So if W is connected to X and Y, then Y is connected to W and Z. Then, Line(W,Y) is a side, and Line(Z,Y) is another side. So in that case, ZY and WY are adjacent sides, meeting at Y. Thus, their lengths would be equal if it's a square, but not necessarily otherwise. However, the given equality says Length(ZY) equals Length(WY), which would be true if it's a square. But then, the other equality says Length(ZY) equals Length(WX), which would also be true in a square. 

Wait, but then there's another equality: Length(ZY) equals Length(WY). So if it's a square, then all sides are equal, so yes. So maybe the rectangle is actually a square. But then, the other part of the problem involves point P, with ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5, and ZY = ZP + PY. Since ZY is a side of the square, which equals WX, and also equals the diagonal WY? Wait, no. If it's a square, then the diagonal would be longer than the side. So if ZY is a side, then the diagonal would be ZY multiplied by sqrt(2). But the equality says that ZY equals the diagonal, which would only hold if ZY is zero, which is impossible. 

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So perhaps my assumption that the rectangle is a square is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the given predicates are not about a rectangle but about something else. Wait, the initial predicate is Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), so it's definitely a rectangle. 

Let me take a different approach. Let's focus on the algebraic part. We're told that ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5. Also, ZY = ZP + PY, so substituting gives ZY = (4x -9) + (2x +5) = 6x -4. Additionally, from the given predicates, ZY equals WX (since they are opposite sides of the rectangle) and also equals WY (diagonal). Wait, but that would mean that the side ZY equals the diagonal WY. Let's write down these equations:

Let’s denote the length of ZY as S. Then:

From the given, S = 6x -4.

Also, since ZY is a side of the rectangle, and in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Let’s call the other sides as follows: suppose the rectangle has sides of length a and b. Then, the diagonals would be sqrt(a² + b²). 

But in our case, ZY is one side. Let's assume that ZY is one of the sides, say length a. Then, the other side would be length b. Then, the diagonal would be sqrt(a² + b²). According to the given, ZY equals the diagonal, so a = sqrt(a² + b²). Squaring both sides gives a² = a² + b² → b² = 0 → b = 0. Which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, but the problem also includes another equality: Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))). So ZY equals WX. Since in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so ZY equals WX, which is consistent. But then, the other equality says ZY equals WY, which is the diagonal. So combining these, we have that the side ZY equals the diagonal WY. Which again leads us to the same contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the way I'm interpreting the given predicates.

Wait, perhaps Line(W,Y) is not the diagonal. Let me re-examine the given Line predicates. The user wrote:

Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Line(Z,Y)
Line(W,Y)
Line(Z,P)
Line(P,Y)

So Line(W,Y) exists. In a rectangle, W and Y are opposite corners, so Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. But according to the given predicates, Line(Z,Y) is a side (since it's part of the rectangle), and Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. So the equality between their lengths implies that the side equals the diagonal. Which is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not convex? Or maybe it's folded in some way? Or perhaps the points are not in the usual order. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to see if that helps.

Let me place point Z at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, let's define the coordinates:

Assume rectangle WXYZ with Z at (0,0). Let's say that side ZY is along the y-axis. So point Y would be at (0, a), where a is the length of ZY. Then, since it's a rectangle, point W would be somewhere. Let me think. If Z is (0,0), Y is (0,a). To form a rectangle, the other points need to be placed appropriately. Let me consider that W is connected to Z and X. Suppose that side ZW is horizontal. So if Z is at (0,0), then W could be at (b,0), making ZW horizontal. Then, since it's a rectangle, point X would be at (b, c), and point Y at (0,c). Wait, but then the connection from X to Y would be vertical. Let me check:

Points:

Z: (0,0)

W: (b,0)

X: (b,c)

Y: (0,c)

Then, the sides are:

ZW: from (0,0) to (b,0)

WX: from (b,0) to (b,c)

XY: from (b,c) to (0,c)

YZ: from (0,c) to (0,0)

Wait, but then Line(Y,Z) would be from Y (0,c) to Z (0,0), which is vertical, and Line(W,Y) would be from W (b,0) to Y (0,c), which is a diagonal. So in this setup, ZY has length c (vertical side), and WY has length sqrt(b² + c²) (diagonal). So the given equality says that ZY equals WY, so c = sqrt(b² + c²), leading to b = 0, which is impossible. Again, contradiction.

Hmm. So this suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent unless b=0, which collapses the rectangle into a line segment. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. Let me look back at the given predicates.

Wait, the problem says "Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)", which may imply that the points are ordered such that the sides are W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. In that case, the diagonals would be W-Y and X-Z. So Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. But the given equality says that LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,Y)), meaning the side ZY equals the diagonal WY. Which again implies that the side equals the diagonal, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem's predicates or my understanding of them.

Alternatively, maybe Line(W,Y) is not a diagonal but another side? How could that be? For instance, if the rectangle is labeled W, X, Y, Z such that W is connected to X and Y, X is connected to W and Z, Y is connected to W and Z, and Z is connected to X and Y. In this case, the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. So the diagonals would be W-Z and X-Y. Then, Line(W,Y) would be a side (if W and Y are connected directly). Wait, but in this configuration, W is connected to X and Y, so Line(W,Y) would be a side. Then, ZY is also a side (from Z to Y). So if ZY and WY are both sides of the rectangle, then they are adjacent sides, meeting at Y. Therefore, their lengths can be different. But the given equality says that Length(ZY) equals Length(WY), which would mean that the two adjacent sides are equal, making it a square. But then, in that case, the diagonals would be equal to the sides multiplied by sqrt(2). But the other equality says that Length(ZY) equals Length(WX), which would also be true since opposite sides are equal. So maybe this is possible?

Wait, if the rectangle is a square, then all sides are equal. So ZY is a side, WY is another side (since W and Y are adjacent), so they are equal. Then, the diagonal would be longer than the side. But according to the given predicates, there is no mention of the diagonal being equal to anything except ZY. Wait, the other equality is Length(ZY) equals Length(WX), which is true for a square. So maybe the rectangle is a square. But then, why does the problem involve point P?

Ah! The other part of the problem is about point P. It says Line(Z,P) and Line(P,Y), with ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5. Also, ZY = ZP + PY. So ZY is the sum of ZP and PY. If ZY is a side of the square, then ZY = ZP + PY. So, in this scenario, point P lies on the side ZY, dividing it into segments ZP and PY. Wait, but if ZY is a side of the square, then P is a point on that side. So the total length ZY is equal to ZP + PY, which is just the length of the side. 

But earlier, we had that ZY equals the diagonal WY. But if ZY is a side of the square, then the diagonal would be longer. So this would imply that the side equals the diagonal, which is only possible if the side length is zero. Contradiction again. 

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify:

If the rectangle is a square with side length s, then each side is s, and the diagonal is s√2. The given equality says that ZY (which is a side) equals the diagonal WY. So s = s√2 → √2 = 1, which is false. Hence, contradiction.

Unless... Wait, maybe the line WY is not the diagonal but another side? Let me re-express the points. If the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z with sides W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. Then, WY would be the diagonal. But if instead, the rectangle is labeled such that W-Y is a side. How? For example, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, so that the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. Then, the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. In this case, W-Y would be a diagonal. Wait, no. If the rectangle is W connected to X and Y, X connected to W and Z, Z connected to X and Y, Y connected to Z and W. Then, W is connected to X and Y, making W-Y a diagonal? No, if W is connected to Y directly, then W-Y would be a side. Wait, but in that case, the rectangle would have sides W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. So W-Y is a side. Then, ZY is also a side (from Z to Y). So in this case, ZY and WY are adjacent sides of the rectangle, meeting at Y. So their lengths could be different. But the given equality says that ZY equals WY. So that would imply that the rectangle is a square. 

But in that case, the diagonal would be from W to Z, and from X to Y. Let me calculate the diagonal. If the rectangle is a square with side length s, then the diagonal is s√2. But the given equality says that ZY equals WY, which are sides, and equals the diagonal? No, the equality is between ZY and WY. Wait, no. Earlier, the equality was between ZY and WY. Wait, the given predicate is Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))). So if ZY is a side and WY is another side, then this equality implies that both sides are equal, hence it's a square. Then, the other equality is Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))), which is also true since it's a square. 

So assuming that the rectangle is a square, with side length s = ZY = WY = WX = ... etc. Then, ZY is s, and ZP + PY = s. Given that ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5, so:

4x -9 + 2x +5 = s  
=> 6x -4 = s  

But since it's a square, the diagonal is s√2. But where does the diagonal come into play here? Wait, the problem didn't mention the diagonal directly, except for the equality between ZY and WY. So maybe there's no need to consider the diagonal here. 

But the question asks for ZX. In the square, ZX would be the diagonal. Because if the square has points W, X, Z, Y arranged such that W is connected to X and Y, X is connected to W and Z, Z is connected to X and Y, Y is connected to Z and W. Then, the diagonal would be from X to Y or from W to Z. Wait, in this arrangement, the diagonal from Z to X would be a diagonal of the square. So ZX is the diagonal. 

Wait, but if the square has side length s, then the diagonal is s√2. But we need to find ZX. From the above, s = 6x -4. So ZX, the diagonal, would be s√2. But the question is asking for ZX. Wait, but the options are numerical answers. However, the problem gives us ZP and PY in terms of x, and we have s = 6x -4. But how do we find x? 

Wait, maybe there's more information. Let me check the given predicates again. Are there any other equalities involving x? The user provided:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), 4*x - 9)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Y)), 2*x + 5)

These are the only ones involving x. So we have ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5. And ZY = ZP + PY = 6x -4. But we also know that ZY is a side of the square, so s = 6x -4. But how does this help us find x?

Wait, maybe there's another condition from the rectangle's properties. For example, since it's a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal. But we don't have any direct information about the diagonal. However, maybe there's a relation between the diagonal and the sides? Or perhaps there's another equation from the given predicates?

Wait, the problem also includes RightAngle(Angle(W,Z,Y)), which is angle at Z between W, Z, Y. Since it's a rectangle, this angle is 90 degrees. So that checks out. Similarly for other angles. 

But I'm stuck because I don't see another equation to solve for x. Wait, maybe the fact that ZY is a side of the square, and ZX is the diagonal. So ZX = s√2. But without knowing the value of s, we can't compute it. But the answer choices are numerical, so there must be a way to find x. 

Wait, but we have ZY = 6x -4, which is the side length. But how do we relate this to find x? Maybe there's another condition from the problem. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that Line(Z,Y) equals Line(W,Y). If it's a square, then Line(Z,Y) is a side, and Line(W,Y) is another side, which are equal. So that's satisfied. But how does that help us? 

Maybe there's another relationship from the rectangle. For example, the diagonals are equal. But since we don't have any info about diagonals, maybe not. 

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the equality should be between ZY and the diagonal. Let me check the original problem again. 

Original problem's predicates include:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y)))

Which I thought meant that the side ZY equals the diagonal WY. But if that's the case, then we have a contradiction. However, if it's a square, then ZY equals WY (both sides), and the diagonal is longer. So maybe the problem intended that ZY equals the diagonal, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that ZY equals the diagonal, but there's a miscalculation. Let me assume that there's a mistake in the problem, and that the equality should be between ZY and the diagonal. Let me try that approach. 

Assuming that ZY equals the diagonal WY, then we have:

ZY = diagonal = sqrt(s^2 + t^2), where s and t are the sides of the rectangle. But since ZY is a side, say s, then:

s = sqrt(s^2 + t^2) → t = 0, which is impossible. 

So this approach doesn't work. 

Wait, but maybe the rectangle is not a square, and the equality between ZY and WY is not referring to the diagonal. Maybe Line(W,Y) is a side, not a diagonal. How?

Let me try to reassign the points. Suppose the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z with sides W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. Then, the diagonals are W-Y and X-Z. So Line(W,Y) is a diagonal. But the given equality says Length(ZY) equals Length(WY). So ZY is a side, WY is a diagonal. So:

Length(ZY) = Length(WY)

Which implies that the side equals the diagonal. As before, this leads to a contradiction unless it's a degenerate rectangle. 

But since the problem provides valid answer choices, there must be a way. Let me try to proceed with the algebra. We have ZY = 6x -4, and ZY is a side of the rectangle. Also, since it's a rectangle, the other side (say, WX) is equal to ZY. But we don't have information about the other side. However, the problem asks for ZX, which is likely the diagonal. If I can express ZX in terms of x, then maybe I can find x from some condition.

Wait, but how? Let me think. If ZY is a side, and the other side is, say, WX, which is also equal to ZY. So both sides are equal, making it a square. Then, ZX would be the diagonal. So ZX = ZY * sqrt(2) = (6x -4)*sqrt(2). But the answer choices are numerical, so this suggests that we need to find x such that this expression evaluates to one of the options. But without additional info, I can't find x.

Wait, but maybe there's another condition. Let me check the given predicates again. Are there any other equalities? The user included:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,Y)))) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), 4*x - 9) 
Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Y)), 2*x + 5)

So, from ZY = 6x -4, and ZY equals WX (another side), and ZY equals WY (diagonal). But this leads to contradictions. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a rectangle but about a different quadrilateral? But the first predicate says Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), so it must be a rectangle. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on the algebra. We have ZY = 6x -4. And the question is to find ZX. Assuming that ZX is the diagonal, then if it's a square, ZX = ZY*sqrt(2) = (6x -4)*sqrt(2). But since the answer choices are integers, this suggests that maybe there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe ZX is a side, not the diagonal. For example, if the rectangle has sides ZY and WX, and ZX is another side. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if ZY is one side, then WX is equal to it. The other pair of sides are XY and ZW. So ZX would be a diagonal. 

Wait, but if ZX is a diagonal, and if the rectangle is a square, then ZX = ZY*sqrt(2). But without knowing the value of x, I can't proceed. 

But maybe there's a way to find x from the given data. Let me think: ZY = 6x -4, and since ZY is a side of the rectangle, and the other side is WX, which is also equal to ZY. But how does that help? 

Wait, perhaps there's another relationship from the point P. Since P is on ZY, and ZP + PY = ZY. But we already used that to get ZY = 6x -4. 

Is there any other condition involving x? The problem doesn't provide any other equations. So unless there's a hidden condition, I can't find x. 

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the equality between ZY and WY is supposed to be between ZY and the diagonal. Let me try that. Assume that ZY is a side, and WY is the diagonal. So:

ZY = diagonal => s = sqrt(s² + t²) → t = 0, which is invalid. 

But if we ignore this contradiction and proceed, maybe we can derive x. Let's say that ZY = diagonal. So:

ZY = sqrt(ZW² + WY²) ? No, in a rectangle, the diagonal squared equals the sum of squares of the sides. So if ZY is one side, and WZ is the other side, then diagonal WY = sqrt(ZY² + WZ²). But if ZY = WY, then:

ZY = sqrt(ZY² + WZ²) → ZY² = ZY² + WZ² → WZ = 0, which is impossible. 

Thus, this approach fails. 

Given that I'm unable to resolve the contradiction, maybe the problem assumes that ZY is equal to the diagonal, and there's a calculation error, or perhaps it's a trick question. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about a rectangle but about a different shape. Wait, but the first predicate is Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), so it must be a rectangle. 

At this point, I'll try to proceed with the assumption that the rectangle is a square, despite the contradiction, and see if I can find x. 

If it's a square, then ZY is a side, and ZP + PY = ZY. So ZP + PY = s = 6x -4. But since P is a point on ZY, and ZP = 4x -9, PY = 2x +5. These are lengths, so they must be positive. So:

4x -9 > 0 → x > 9/4 = 2.25  
2x +5 > 0 → x > -2.5  
So x must be greater than 2.25. 

Additionally, since ZP + PY = s, and s = 6x -4, but also, since it's a square, the diagonal is s√2. But how does this help? 

Wait, perhaps there's no more information, and the question is to find ZX, which is the diagonal. But without knowing s, we can't compute it. However, the answer choices are numbers, so maybe there's a way to find x from another condition. 

Wait, the problem might have a typo, and the equality between ZY and WY is actually between ZY and WX. But that's already given. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to find ZX as the side, not the diagonal. For example, if ZX is another side of the rectangle. But in that case, ZX would be equal to ZY, so ZX = 6x -4. But then, the answer choices are A.9, B.10, C.19, D.38. So we need to find x such that 6x -4 equals one of these. 

But how? We need another equation to solve for x. 

Wait, but there's no other equation. Unless there's an implicit condition that the lengths must be positive, and possibly other constraints. 

For example, since ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5, and P is on ZY, then ZP and PY must be positive. So 4x -9 > 0 → x > 2.25, and 2x +5 > 0 → x > -2.5. So x > 2.25. 

But without additional constraints, x could be any value greater than 2.25, making ZY = 6x -4 vary. Hence, ZX (assuming it's a side) would also vary. 

But the answer choices are fixed, so there must be a unique solution. This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves the Pythagorean theorem. Let me think. If ZY is a side, and P is a point on ZY such that ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5, then ZY = 6x -4. If there's a right triangle involved, perhaps with ZY as one leg, and another side as the other leg, leading to the hypotenuse. 

But where would that come from? The problem includes RightAngle(Angle(W,Z,Y)), which is a right angle at Z between W, Z, Y. So triangle WZY is a right triangle with legs WZ and ZY, and hypotenuse WY. 

But earlier, we have WY = ZY (from the given equality). So in this right triangle, WZ and ZY are the legs, and WY is the hypotenuse. So:

WY² = WZ² + ZY²  
But since WY = ZY (given), this becomes:

ZY² = WZ² + ZY² → WZ = 0, which is impossible. 

Again, contradiction. 

But if we ignore the contradiction and proceed, assuming WZ is non-zero, then:

ZY² = WZ² + ZY² → WZ = 0. 

So this suggests that WZ = 0, which implies that points W and Z are the same, which is impossible. 

This indicates that the problem contains conflicting information, making it unsolvable as stated. 

However, since the problem provides answer choices, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Let me revisit the original problem statement carefully. 

The problem says:

"Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z)
Point(W)
Point(X)
Point(Y)
Point(Z)
Point(P)
Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Line(Z,Y)
Line(W,Y)
RightAngle(Angle(W,Z,Y))
RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,X))
RightAngle(Angle(Y,X,W))
RightAngle(Angle(X,W,Z))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X)))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,Y)))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,Y))))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,P)), 4*x - 9)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Y)), 2*x + 5)"

Wait, the first few predicates define the rectangle, then the lines, then the right angles, then the equalities. 

Now, the critical part is the last three equalities:

- LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,X)): this is true for a rectangle, since opposite sides are equal.

- LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,Y)): this is the diagonal WY equals the side ZY.

- LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals ZP + PY: which gives us ZY = 6x -4.

But the second equality is problematic. Let me think: if Line(W,Y) is not the diagonal, but another side. How?

Suppose the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z with sides W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W. Then, Line(W,Y) is a diagonal, but if the rectangle is labeled differently, like W, X, Z, Y, then Line(W,Y) could be a side. Let me try this.

Imagine the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y. So the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. In this case, Line(W,Y) is a side (from W to Y), and Line(Z,Y) is another side (from Z to Y). So both are sides of the rectangle, meeting at Y. Hence, their lengths can be equal, making it a square. 

In this case, the rectangle has sides W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. So if W-X and Z-Y are both sides, and if they are equal, it's a square. Then, the diagonal would be from W to Z or from X to Y. 

In this scenario, Line(W,Y) is a side (length s), Line(Z,Y) is also a side (length s), and Line(W,X) is another side (length s). So all sides are equal, making it a square. 

Then, the diagonal would be s√2. But the problem asks for ZX. What is ZX in this case?

If the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then point Z is connected to X and Y. So ZX is a side of the rectangle, which is equal to ZY. Wait, no. If the rectangle is W-X-Z-Y-W, then ZX is a diagonal from Z to X. Wait, in this case, the sides are W-X, X-Z, Z-Y, Y-W. So the diagonals are W-Y and X-Z. 

So ZX is a diagonal from Z to X. In a square, this diagonal would be s√2. 

But we have ZY = s = 6x -4. So ZX = s√2 = (6x -4)√2. But the answer choices are integers, so this suggests that perhaps there's a mistake, or that the problem assumes that ZX is equal to ZY, which would be s, but that would make it a square, and ZX would be the diagonal, not a side. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers ZX as a side. Let me check. If the rectangle is W-X-Z-Y-W, then ZX is a diagonal, not a side. 

But if the rectangle is labeled differently, like W, X, Y, Z, with sides W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W, then ZX is a diagonal. 

But regardless, if we assume that ZX is the diagonal, and we need to find its length, but we don't have enough information. 

However, the problem provides ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5, and ZY = 6x -4. If we assume that P is a point on ZY, then ZP + PY = ZY, which is already accounted for. 

But how to find x? There must be another condition. Let me think: the problem includes the right angles. For example, RightAngle(Angle(W,Z,Y)), which is a right angle at Z between W, Z, Y. So triangle WZY is a right triangle with legs WZ and ZY, and hypotenuse WY. 

But from the given, WY = ZY (since LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,Y))). So in this right triangle, WY = ZY, which implies that WZ = 0, which is impossible. 

But if we ignore this, and proceed, then:

WY = ZY = 6x -4  
And WY² = WZ² + ZY²  
Substituting WY = ZY, we get:  
(6x -4)^2 = WZ² + (6x -4)^2 → WZ = 0. 

This is a contradiction. 

However, if we assume that there's a miscalculation and that the equality should be between ZY and WZ, then we could proceed. Let me try that. Suppose the equality is between ZY and WZ. Then, since it's a rectangle, WZ = ZY, making it a square. Then, the diagonal WY = ZY * sqrt(2). But we don't have information about the diagonal. 

But the problem asks for ZX. If ZX is the diagonal, then ZX = ZY * sqrt(2) = (6x -4)*sqrt(2). Still, without knowing x, we cannot proceed. 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the algebra, assuming that the problem has a typo and the equality between ZY and WY is actually between ZY and WZ, making it a square. Then, ZX is the diagonal. 

Let me assume that the correct equality is LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)) equals LengthOf(Line(W,Z)), making it a square. Then, ZY = WZ = s, and ZX is the diagonal, s√2. 

But how to find x? We have ZY = 6x -4, and since it's a square, the diagonal is s√2. But we don't have any info about the diagonal. 

Wait, but there's another equality: Equals(LengthOf(Line(Z,Y)), LengthOf(Line(W,X))). Which is already true since it's a square. 

No new information. 

But the problem gives us ZP = 4x -9 and PY = 2x +5. Since P is on ZY, and ZY = 6x -4, we have ZP + PY = 6x -4. But this is already used. 

Without additional information, x cannot be determined. 

But the answer choices are fixed, so there must be a way. Let me think: maybe the problem assumes that ZY is the diagonal, and the other side is WZ, and uses the Pythagorean theorem. 

Assume that ZY is the diagonal, and WZ is a side. Then, from the given, ZY = WY (diagonal), and WY = ZY. So this would mean that the diagonal equals itself, which is always true. But how does this help? 

Alternatively, if ZY is the diagonal, and WZ is a side, then:

ZY = sqrt(WZ² + WY²). But since WY is also a side, let's say WY = a, WZ = b. Then, ZY = sqrt(a² + b²). But from the given, ZY = WY = a. So:

a = sqrt(a² + b²) → b = 0. 

Still impossible. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's an error in the problem statement. However, since the answer choices are provided, and the only possible way to proceed is to assume that the problem
