====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, given that AB is perpendicular to BC. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and see how they connect.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There are several lines: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GC. Also, there are some angles mentioned: Angle(A,B,C) which I think is angle at point B between points A, B, C. Then Angle(D,A,B) which would be the angle at point A between points D, A, B. And Angle(C,E,F) at point E between C, E, F. 

Also, there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(A,B,C), so that means angle ABC is a right angle because AB is perpendicular to BC. Wait, the problem states AB ⊥ BC, which confirms that angle at B (ABC) is 90 degrees. But wait, the given also says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), 36). So angle DAB is 36 degrees. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,F)) is 40 degrees. 

So, maybe we need to find another angle, perhaps angle 2, which could be one of these angles? Or maybe it's referring to another angle formed by these lines. Wait, the problem mentions angle 2, but since the original problem isn't shown here, maybe angle 2 refers to a specific angle in the diagram. Since the user hasn't provided the diagram, I have to infer based on the given predicates.

Let me try to sketch mentally the structure. Points A, B, C connected as lines AB, BC, then CD, DE, EF, FG, and GC. So starting from A to B to C, then C connects to D, D to E, E to F, F to G, and G back to C. So forming a polygon? Maybe a hexagon? Not sure yet. 

Given that AB is perpendicular to BC, making triangle ABC a right triangle at B. Also, angle DAB is 36 degrees. That would be angle at A between DA and AB. Hmm. So point D is connected to C via line CD, so maybe D is somewhere such that line CD connects to C. Similarly, E is connected to D, F to E, G to F, and G connects back to C. 

Now, angle at E, which is angle CEF, measures 40 degrees. So angle at E between C, E, F is 40 degrees. 

We need to find the measure of angle 2. Since the problem refers to angle 2, but without a diagram, I need to deduce where angle 2 could be. Given that there are various angles mentioned, perhaps angle 2 refers to another angle in the figure. Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is part of a triangle or intersection involving those lines.

Wait, considering the lines given, maybe there are intersecting lines creating other angles. For example, line AB is perpendicular to BC, so that forms a right angle. Then, line CD connects to C, so maybe there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving these points. 

Alternatively, since angle DAB is 36 degrees, which is at point A between D and B. Since AB is a line, and DA is connected to D. So point D is connected to A and C. So maybe triangle ADC? Or something like that.

Another thought: since there's a line from G to C, and lines going through E, F, etc., perhaps there's a transversal or something. But maybe focusing on the given angles first.

Given that angle ABC is 90 degrees (since AB ⊥ BC). Also, angle DAB is 36 degrees. So in triangle ABD? Wait, but D is connected to C. Maybe triangle ABD? Wait, but BD isn't necessarily a line. Unless there's a connection. Wait, line CD connects to C. So maybe line AD is connected to D?

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle ABD, where angle at A is 36 degrees, and AB is one side. But without knowing more about the sides, it's hard to say. However, maybe there are other angles involved.

Also, angle CEF is 40 degrees. So at point E, between C, E, F. So that's part of triangle CEF? Or maybe part of another shape.

But the main thing is to find angle 2. Let me think again. Since the problem gives us two angles: angle DAB = 36°, and angle CEF = 40°, and asks for angle 2. Maybe angle 2 is part of a triangle where these angles are involved, or perhaps a vertical angle or something.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed by certain lines where angle 2 is an external or internal angle. For instance, if there's a triangle with angles 36°, 40°, and angle 2, then summing up to 180°. Wait, but that depends on the configuration.

Wait, but angle ABC is 90°, so maybe there's a way to use that. Let me consider the entire figure. Starting with AB perpendicular to BC. Then, from C, there's line CD. From D, line DE. From E, line EF. From F, line FG. From G, line GC. So connecting back to C. This seems like a polygon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But maybe not a simple polygon due to overlapping lines.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple triangles. For example, triangle ABC, triangle DAB, triangle CEF, etc. Let me think about triangle ABC. It's a right triangle at B. So angles at A and C would add up to 90°. But we don't know their measures yet.

Then, angle DAB is 36°, which is part of triangle DAB. Wait, if D is connected to A and C, then line DA and line AB form angle DAB of 36°. So in triangle DAB, angle at A is 36°, and angle at B is... Well, AB is connected to B, but where is D located? If line CD connects to C, then D is connected to C, so line CD. So maybe triangle DBC? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal creating alternate interior angles. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. Another approach: since angle DAB is 36°, and angle ABC is 90°, perhaps there's a way to relate them through triangle ABD or something else.

Wait, if we look at point A, with lines AB and AD. AB is connected to B, and AD is connected to D. So angle between AB and AD is 36°, which is angle DAB. Now, if we can find other angles around point A or elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD. In that case, angle at A is 36°, angle at B is part of the right angle. Wait, but AB is connected to B, and BD would be another line. But unless BD is defined, we can't assume it exists. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at line CD. Since line CD connects to C, which is connected to B via BC. So line CD starts at C and goes to D. Then DE connects to E, etc. Maybe there's a way to find angles along those lines.

Another thought: since angle CEF is 40°, which is at point E. So line EC and line EF form that angle. Maybe triangle CEF has angles 40°, and possibly other angles that can be used.

Alternatively, maybe there's a larger triangle or quadrilateral where these angles fit. Let me think again. Suppose we have triangle ABC with right angle at B. Then, from point C, there's line CD leading to D, then D to E, E to F, F to G, and G back to C. So the figure includes a polygon from C to D to E to F to G to C. So that's a pentagon? Or a different shape.

But how does this connect to the rest? Maybe lines from other points. Like, line AB is connected to A and B, and line DA connects to D and A. So maybe there's a quadrilateral or triangle involving A, B, D.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find the missing angle in some triangle where two angles are known. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 36°, 40°, and angle 2, then angle 2 would be 180 - 36 - 40 = 104°, but that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, if angle 2 is part of a different configuration.

Wait, the answer choices are 64, 68, 72, 76. These numbers suggest that angle 2 might be supplementary or complementary to other angles. Let me think again.

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, angle ABC is 90°. Then, angle DAB is 36°, so maybe triangle ABD has angles adding up. But without knowing more sides or angles, it's tricky. Alternatively, if there's a straight line or something.

Wait, suppose there's a triangle involving angle DAB (36°), angle ABC (90°), and another angle. Maybe angle BAD and angle ABC are parts of a larger angle? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering that angle DAB is 36°, and AB is perpendicular to BC. So if we imagine extending some lines, maybe creating alternate angles or something.

Wait, maybe there's a transversal cutting across parallel lines, but we don't know if any lines are parallel. The only given relationship is that AB is perpendicular to BC, so AB ⊥ BC.

Alternatively, maybe triangle CEF with angle 40°, and if there's a way to relate that to another triangle. For example, if lines EF and AB are parallel, then corresponding angles could be equal. But there's no info on that.

Alternatively, maybe considering the sum of angles around a point. For example, if angle DAB is 36°, and angle at A from another line, adding up to 180° if they're adjacent.

Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Perhaps I need to focus on the given angles and see if they can form a system of equations.

Let me try to consider triangle ABC, which is a right triangle at B. Therefore, angles at A and C sum to 90°. Let's denote angle at A (which is angle BAC) as x, and angle at C (angle ACB) as y, so x + y = 90°.

But how does this relate to the given angles? We have angle DAB = 36°, which is at point A between D and B. So if line AD is connected to D, then angle between AD and AB is 36°, implying that angle BAD is 36°. So angle BAD is part of angle BAC (if D lies on AC). Wait, but line CD connects to C. So if D is connected to C, then line CD starts at C. So point D is connected to C, so line CD. Therefore, point D is somewhere such that line CD extends from C.

Therefore, if we consider triangle ACD, or something else. If line AD connects to D, then maybe triangle ABD or ACD.

Alternatively, if line AD intersects with line BC or something else. Without a diagram, it's challenging, but let's make assumptions.

Assume that point D is connected to A and C. So line AD connects A to D, and line CD connects C to D. Thus, forming triangle ACD. In this case, angle at A (BAD) is 36°, and angle at C (maybe angle ACD?) is something else.

But how does that tie into the rest? Also, angle CEF is 40°, which is at point E between C, E, F. So line CE and EF form that angle. Maybe there's a connection between these angles.

Another idea: since AB ⊥ BC, then AB is perpendicular to BC, so AB is a vertical line if BC is horizontal, for example. Then, line CD comes off from C. Depending on where D is, it could form various angles. But again, without the diagram, it's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle at point C or E or F. For instance, angle at E is 40°, but maybe angle at C is being asked. Or maybe angle at G or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is the third angle in a triangle where two angles are known. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 36° and 40°, then the third angle would be 104°, but that's not among the options. However, if the triangle is not directly connected, maybe there's another relation.

Wait, let me think about the total sum of angles in polygons. For example, if there's a quadrilateral or pentagon. But without knowing the exact shape, it's hard.

Wait, another thought: since AB is perpendicular to BC, and angle DAB is 36°, maybe there's a way to compute angle between BA and DA, which is 36°, and since AB is perpendicular to BC, which is a right angle, maybe there's a way to find other angles using triangle relations.

For example, if we consider triangle ABD, where AB is one leg, AD is another, and BD is the hypotenuse. But we only know one angle (36° at A), so not enough to find others.

Alternatively, if line DA is extended to meet some other line, creating another angle. Or maybe line CD creates some relationship with AB.

Wait, since line CD connects to C, which is connected to BC. So line CD starts at C, which is the endpoint of BC. So if we consider triangle BCD, but we don't know much about it.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle DAB and triangle ECF. Since angle DAB is 36°, and angle CEF is 40°, perhaps there's a way to relate these angles through similar triangles or something else.

Wait, here's a new idea: maybe the lines form a series of triangles with angles that add up. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 36°, 40°, and angle 2, then angle 2 would be 180 - 36 - 40 = 104°, but that's not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is part of a triangle with one angle being 90°, then angle 2 could be found by subtracting other angles. For example, if there's a right triangle with angles 90°, 36°, and angle 2, then angle 2 would be 54°, still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe angle 2 is an exterior angle. For instance, if it's an exterior angle to a triangle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. For example, if angle 2 is an exterior angle to a triangle with angles 36° and 40°, then angle 2 would be 76°, which is one of the options (option D). That seems promising.

Wait, let me check that. If angle 2 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Suppose those two angles are 36° and 40°, then angle 2 would be 36+40=76°, which is option D. That fits.

But how do we know angle 2 is an exterior angle to a triangle with those two angles? Let me think. If there's a triangle where one of its angles is 36°, another is 40°, and angle 2 is an exterior angle at the third vertex, then yes. But how does that relate to the given data?

Perhaps the triangle in question involves angle DAB (36°) and angle CEF (40°). But how are these connected? Maybe through some transversal or parallel lines.

Alternatively, since AB is perpendicular to BC, and if there's a line that forms an angle with AB or BC, creating a scenario where angle 2 is an exterior angle.

Another possibility: the lines from D to A and from E to F might form some relation. For example, if lines DA and EF are parallel, then corresponding angles could be equal. But without knowing that, it's uncertain.

Wait, another angle: since angle ABC is 90°, and angle DAB is 36°, maybe angle BAD is 36°, which is part of angle BAC. So angle BAC = 36° + something? Wait, no. If D is on AC, then angle BAD would be part of angle BAC. But if D is not on AC, then it's a separate angle.

This is getting too vague. Let me try to think of another approach. Since the answer options are 64, 68, 72, 76, and considering that 36 + 40 = 76, which is option D, it's possible that angle 2 is the sum of those two angles. Hence, the answer might be D. But why?

Maybe angle 2 is formed by the intersection of two lines, each of which forms angles of 36° and 40°, making angle 2 their sum. For example, if two lines cross, creating vertical angles, and one pair of opposite angles are 36° and 40°, but that doesn't fit. Or if angle 2 is an exterior angle to a triangle where the two remote interior angles are 36° and 40°, making angle 2 = 76°.

That seems plausible. So if angle 2 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles, which are 36° and 40°, totaling 76°, hence option D.

But how to confirm this? Let's think: if there's a triangle where one angle is 36°, another is 40°, and angle 2 is outside the triangle, then it would be 76°. But how does that connect to the given information?

Alternatively, maybe the lines AB and EF are parallel, creating corresponding angles. If AB is perpendicular to BC, and EF is parallel to AB, then angle CEF (40°) would correspond to some angle related to AB. But I'm just guessing here.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC has angle at B of 90°, angle at A of 36°, making angle at C 54°, since 90 + 36 + 54 = 180. Then, if angle at C is 54°, and angle CEF is 40°, then maybe there's a way to relate those angles. For example, if angle at C is 54°, and angle CEF is 40°, then the remaining angle at E would be 54 - 40 = 14°, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, but if angle at C is 54°, and there's a line from C to D, forming angle DCA, then angle DCA could be part of that. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving point E where angle CEF is 40°, and other angles. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 40°, and some other angles that relate to the 36° angle.

But I'm stuck. Given that the answer options include 76°, which is 36+40, and assuming that angle 2 is the sum of those two angles (as an exterior angle), I think the intended answer is D. So I'll go with that.
