Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, and F. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Line(E,F), Line(C,F), and Line(F,B). Also, there's a RightAngle at Angle(C,F,B), meaning that CF is perpendicular to FB. Additionally, there's a circle centered at F, denoted as ⊙F. The measure of angle DFA is given as 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of arc ACE.

Let me visualize this. Since F is the center of the circle, points A, C, D, E, and B must lie on the circumference? Wait, but not necessarily all of them. Wait, the circle is named ⊙F, so F is the center. So any point connected to F via a line would be a radius if it's on the circle. But the problem mentions Line(C,F) and Line(F,B), so maybe C and B are points on the circle? Because they're connected to F, which is the center. But wait, if C and B are on the circle, then FC and FB are radii. However, since CF is perpendicular to FB, that means angle CFB is a right angle. So triangle CFB is a right-angled triangle with right angle at F. Therefore, CF and FB are radii of the circle, making CB the hypotenuse of this right triangle. So CB would be the diameter? Wait, because in a circle, if two radii form a right angle, the distance between their endpoints would be sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. So CB is not the diameter unless the angle was 180 degrees. Hmm, okay.

Now, angle DFA is 50 degrees. Let me think about where D is. Line(C,D) exists, so D is another point. Since D is connected to C, and assuming that D is on the circle, then CD would be a chord. But wait, Line(C,D) could just be a straight line, but without more info, perhaps D is on the circle? Or maybe not. Wait, but since F is the center, maybe some other points are on the circle. For example, points A, B, C, D, E could be on the circle. Let me try to map out the points.

Given that Line(E,F) is present, so E is connected to F. Since F is the center, then E must be a point on the circle, because FE would be a radius. Similarly, Line(C,F) implies C is on the circle (since F is the center). Line(F,B) implies B is also on the circle. So points C, B, E are on the circle centered at F. Also, A is connected to B via Line(A,B), so A is connected to B. Is A on the circle? Not sure yet. But angle DFA is given. So D is connected to C (Line(C,D)), and A is connected to D? No, angle DFA is formed by points D-F-A. So D, F, A. So F is the vertex of the angle. So D and A are points such that FD and FA are sides of the angle. Given that F is the center, then if D and A are on the circle, FD and FA would be radii, making angle DFA an inscribed angle? Wait, no. If D and A are on the circle, then angle DFA would be an inscribed angle subtended by arc DA. Wait, but the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But here, the angle is at F, which is the center. Wait, hold on! If F is the center, then angle DFA is actually a central angle if D and A are on the circle. Wait, no. Because angle at F would be formed by two radii. If D and A are on the circle, then FD and FA are radii, making angle DFA a central angle. Then the measure of angle DFA would be equal to the measure of arc DA. But the problem states that m∠DFA = 50°, so arc DA would be 50°, right?

Wait, but then if that's the case, arc DA is 50 degrees. Now, we need to find m∠ACE, which is the measure of arc ACE. Wait, but arc ACE—wait, arcs are typically named by their endpoints, but sometimes with intermediate points. So arc ACE would be from A to E passing through C. So that would be arc AC plus arc CE? Or maybe the entire arc from A to E going through C. Depending on the position of these points.

But first, let's confirm whether D and A are on the circle. Since Line(C,D) and Line(E,F) exist. If D is connected to C, and C is on the circle (as per Line(C,F)), then D could be inside or outside the circle. But if angle DFA is given, and F is the center, then for FD to be a radius, D must be on the circle. Otherwise, FD wouldn't be a radius. Wait, but if D is not on the circle, then FD isn't a radius. So maybe D is on the circle? Let me assume that D is on the circle. Then FD is a radius. Similarly, FA would be a radius if A is on the circle. So angle DFA is formed by two radii, making it a central angle. Thus, the measure of angle DFA equals the measure of arc DA. Hence, arc DA is 50 degrees.

Now, moving on. We also know that CF is perpendicular to FB. Since CF and FB are radii (because C and B are connected to F), forming a right angle. That means angle CFB is 90 degrees. So in the circle, the arc from C to B would be 90 degrees, because the central angle over arc CB is 90 degrees. So arc CB measures 90 degrees.

Our goal is to find the measure of arc ACE. Let me note the points involved. Points A, C, E. So starting at A, going through C to E. So arc ACE would be the sum of arcs AC and CE. Alternatively, depending on the direction, but since it's an arc ACE, probably the major arc or minor arc. Need to figure out how these points are arranged.

First, let's consider the circle with center F. Points C, B, E are on the circle. Point D is on the circle (from earlier assumption). Point A is connected to B via Line(A,B). If A is on the circle, then AB would be a chord. But we don't know yet. However, angle DFA is given, which involves point A. Assuming A is on the circle, then FA is a radius. So FD and FA are both radii, hence angle DFA is central angle, giving arc DA as 50 degrees.

Now, let's think about the rest. Since CF is perpendicular to FB, which gives us that arc CB is 90 degrees. So from point C to point B along the circumference is 90 degrees. Now, we need to relate this to arc ACE. To find arc ACE, we need to figure out the positions of points A, C, and E on the circle.

We might need to use other information. Let's see. What about point E? It's connected to F via Line(E,F), so E is on the circle. So FE is a radius. So E is another point on the circle. So points C, B, E are on the circle. Also, D is on the circle. And A is on the circle (assuming).

So, the circle has points A, B, C, D, E. Let me try to imagine their positions. Let's start with point C and B. Arc CB is 90 degrees. Suppose we place point C at some position, then point B is 90 degrees away from C around the circle. Now, point D is somewhere on the circle such that arc DA is 50 degrees. So if we go from D to A along the circumference, that's 50 degrees. Also, point E is another point on the circle. How does E relate to others?

We need to find arc ACE. Let's suppose that points A, C, E are placed in order around the circle. So starting at A, going through C to E. So the arc from A to E passing through C. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. But we need to figure out the total measure.

Alternatively, maybe arc ACE refers to the arc from A to E passing through C, which would be arc AC plus arc CE. Let's proceed with that.

To compute this, we need to find the measure of arc AC and arc CE. But how do we find those?

First, let's recall that the entire circle is 360 degrees. So if we can find the measures of other arcs, we can find the missing ones.

We know arc CB is 90 degrees. Also, arc DA is 50 degrees. Are there other arcs we can determine?

Also, considering that points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle. Let me think about the relationships between these points. For instance, if we can find angles or other arcs that connect them.

Another thing to note is that angle at F: since F is the center, angles involving F as the vertex are central angles. For example, angle CFB is 90 degrees (given), so arc CB is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle DFA is 50 degrees, so arc DA is 50 degrees. So if we can find arcs involving A, C, E, we can get the desired arc ACE.

But how?

Let me consider the positions again. Let's fix the circle with center F. Let me assign coordinates temporarily to make things clearer. Let me imagine F at the origin (0,0). Let me place point C at (r, 0), so that FC is along the x-axis. Since CF is perpendicular to FB, then FB is vertical. So point B would be at (0, r), since FB is perpendicular to FC. So vector FC is horizontal, FB is vertical. Therefore, point C is (r, 0), point B is (0, r), making arc CB 90 degrees. Now, point E is on the circle; Line(E,F) is given, so E is another point on the circle. Let me choose coordinates for E. Maybe E is at (0, -r)? Wait, but that would make arc BE... Hmm, but we need to relate E to other points.

Alternatively, since angle DFA is 50 degrees, and D is on the circle. Let me think about point D. Since arc DA is 50 degrees, then if I can find where D is located relative to A. Suppose point A is somewhere on the circle. Let me assume that A is at some coordinate. Let me try to define coordinates for clarity.

Let me set the radius of the circle as 1 unit for simplicity. Let me take F as the origin (0,0). Let me place point C at (1,0). Then, since CF is perpendicular to FB, point B would be at (0,1), making FB vertical. So arc CB is 90 degrees from C(1,0) to B(0,1).

Now, angle DFA is 50 degrees. So points D and A are on the circle, with FD and FA being radii. So angle between FD and FA is 50 degrees. Therefore, arc DA is 50 degrees. So the arc from D to A is 50 degrees. Let me suppose that point D is located at some position, say, θ radians from point C. Wait, but I need to relate this to existing points.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the position of point A. Let me think. If we can find where A is relative to other points.

Additionally, there's Line(A,B). So point A is connected to B. Since B is at (0,1), and A is another point on the circle. So line AB connects A to B. Also, angle at F, DFA is 50 degrees. So D is another point on the circle, and angle between FD and FA is 50 degrees.

This seems complex. Maybe I can find coordinates for A and D. Let me attempt that.

Since arc DA is 50 degrees, then if I can find the angular position of D and A. Let me assume that point D is at some angle α from the positive x-axis (since C is at (1,0)). Then point A would be at angle α + 50 degrees, since arc DA is 50 degrees. But I need to determine α based on other constraints.

However, we also have line AB connecting A to B. Point B is at (0,1). So coordinates of B are (0,1). Coordinates of A depend on its angle. Let me denote the angle of point A as β. Then coordinates of A are (cosβ, sinβ). The coordinates of B are (0,1). So the line AB connects (cosβ, sinβ) to (0,1). 

But I'm not sure how that helps directly. Perhaps I need another relation. Let me think about the fact that angle CFB is 90 degrees, and other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc AC and arc CE by relating them through other arcs.

Wait, the total circle is 360 degrees. So if we can express other arcs in terms of known quantities.

We already have arc CB = 90 degrees. Arc DA = 50 degrees. Let me see if there are other arcs we can find.

Suppose we can find the position of point E. Since Line(E,F) exists, and E is on the circle. So E is another point. Without more info, maybe we need to find relations involving E.

Wait, the problem asks for arc ACE. So points A, C, E. Let me think about how these points are positioned. If I can find the measure of arc AC and arc CE, then adding them together would give arc ACE.

But how to find arc AC and arc CE?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between points A, C, E through other elements. Let me check if there's any information about point E.

Wait, Line(E,F) is given, so E is on the circle. But no other info is given about E except that it's connected to F. So E is arbitrary? Unless there's something else.

Wait, maybe there's another angle or arc involving E. The problem doesn't mention any other angles directly. However, perhaps there's a connection through the line CE or something else.

Wait, Line(C,D) is given. So point D is connected to C. Since D is on the circle (as discussed earlier), and C is on the circle. So CD is a chord of the circle. But we don't have any angles related to that.

Hmm. This seems tricky. Let me think differently.

Since we need arc ACE, which is from A to E through C. So that would be arc AC + arc CE. Let me find arc AC and arc CE.

First, arc AC: depends on where A and C are. Similarly for arc CE.

But we know arc CB is 90 degrees. If we can find arc BC, arc CA, etc., but need more info.

Wait, let's consider the entire circle. Let me think about the positions again. Let me imagine that points C, B, E, A, D are placed around the circle.

We know arc CB is 90 degrees. Arc DA is 50 degrees. Let me try to find other arcs.

Assume that the circle is divided into arcs by points A, B, C, D, E. Let me try to find the measure of each arc.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard. Let me think about possible relationships.

Another idea: Since angle DFA is 50 degrees, which corresponds to arc DA of 50 degrees. So if I can find the position of A relative to other points, maybe I can find arc AC.

For example, suppose that point A is located such that when you go from D to A, that's 50 degrees. If I can find where D is relative to other points.

Alternatively, since point D is connected to C (Line(C,D)), and both are on the circle, so CD is a chord. Let me consider the length of CD, but without knowing distances, maybe not helpful.

Wait, maybe using triangle properties. Since CF is perpendicular to FB, forming a right angle. So triangle CFB is a right-angled triangle with legs CF and FB (both radii), so CF=FB=r. Therefore, CB is the hypotenuse, which would be r√2. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? Or inscribed angles?

Wait, another thought: Since F is the center, any angle subtended by a chord at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. But since we already have central angles, maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, but angle at A? For example, if there's an inscribed angle involving A, but I don't see any given angles related to A except angle DFA.

Wait, angle DFA is at F, which is the center. So that's a central angle, so arc DA is 50 degrees. So that's fixed.

Now, what about arc AC? Let me think. If I can find the measure of arc AC, then maybe add it to arc CE to get arc ACE.

Alternatively, if we can find the measure of arc AE, then subtract arc CE or something. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I need to find the measure of arc AC by looking at other arcs. For example, if I can find the measure of arc AB or something else.

Wait, there's Line(A,B). So AB is a chord. But without knowing the angle or arc related to AB, not sure.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between points A and E. Since E is on the circle connected to F, and we need to find arc ACE. Maybe there's symmetry or other properties.

Alternatively, maybe considering that arc ACE is part of the circle, and we can calculate it by subtracting known arcs from the total 360 degrees.

Let me consider the total circle is 360 degrees. Let me list the arcs we know:

Arc CB: 90 degrees.

Arc DA: 50 degrees.

Are there other arcs?

Yes, if we can find arcs DC, CE, EA, etc., but I need to figure out how.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc AC by considering other points.

Let me think: Points C and A are both on the circle. If I can find the measure of arc AC, then...

But how? Maybe by considering other arcs or angles.

Wait, since we have point D on the circle, and arc DA is 50 degrees. If I can find where D is relative to C, then I can find arc DC.

For example, suppose that arc DC is some value, then arc DA is 50 degrees, so arc DC + arc CA = arc DA? Or depending on the direction. It depends on the position of D relative to C and A.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Maybe I need to assume certain positions.

Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let me fix F at (0,0), C at (1,0), B at (0,1). Then, arc CB is 90 degrees.

Now, point D is on the circle, so coordinates of D can be represented as (cosθ, sinθ) for some angle θ. Similarly, point A is on the circle, so coordinates (cosφ, sinφ). The measure of arc DA is 50 degrees, so the angle between points D and A at the center is 50 degrees. So the difference between φ and θ is ±50 degrees, depending on the direction.

Let me assume that θ is the angle for D, and φ is the angle for A. So |φ - θ| = 50 degrees. 

Now, Line(A,B) connects A to B. Coordinates of B are (0,1). Coordinates of A are (cosφ, sinφ). So the slope of AB would be [1 - sinφ]/[0 - cosφ] = (1 - sinφ)/(-cosφ). 

But without more information, this might not help directly. However, maybe there's another condition involving point E?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(E,F), so E is another point on the circle. Let me assume E is at some angle ψ. So coordinates (cosψ, sinψ). 

But how does E relate to other points? The problem asks for arc ACE. So the arc from A to E passing through C. Which would mean that the arc goes from A to C to E. So the measure of arc ACE is arc AC + arc CE.

So, if I can find arc AC and arc CE, then adding them gives the answer.

Let me focus on arc AC. To find arc AC, I need to know the angle between points A and C at the center. Let me call that angle α. Similarly, arc CE would be the angle between C and E, let's say β. Then, arc ACE would be α + β.

But how to find α and β?

We know arc CB is 90 degrees, which is the angle between points C and B. So if we can find the positions of A and E relative to C and B, we might find α and β.

Alternatively, since we know arc DA is 50 degrees, and if we can relate D to other points, maybe we can find more information.

Let me think about point D. Since D is connected to C (Line(C,D)), and both are on the circle. So CD is a chord. The measure of arc CD would be the central angle between C and D. Let me call that γ. Then, since arc DA is 50 degrees, and arc CD is γ, then depending on the direction, arc CA could be γ ± 50 degrees? Not sure. Let me draw this mentally.

If points are ordered C -> D -> A around the circle, then arc CD + arc DA = arc CA. So if arc CD is γ, arc DA is 50 degrees, then arc CA would be γ + 50 degrees. But this depends on the direction of traversal.

Alternatively, if points are arranged such that D is between C and A, then arc CA would be arc CD + arc DA. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's ambiguous.

But maybe there's another way. Let me consider that since arc CB is 90 degrees, and point B is at (0,1), point C is at (1,0). So the arc from C to B is 90 degrees counterclockwise. Now, if I can find where point A is.

Assuming that arc DA is 50 degrees, and point D is somewhere on the circle. Let me assume that D is located such that moving from D to A is 50 degrees clockwise. Let me try to imagine placing D near point C. Suppose D is close to C, then A would be 50 degrees away from D. 

But this is too vague. Maybe I need to use the fact that Line(A,B) exists. So AB is a chord. If I can find the angle at A or something else.

Wait, here's an idea: since F is the center, and A is on the circle, then FA is a radius. Also, line AB connects A to B. So triangle FAB is a triangle with FA and FB as radii. Wait, FB is a radius (since B is on the circle), and FA is also a radius. So triangle FAB is an isosceles triangle with FA = FB. Wait, but FA and FB are both radii, yes. So triangle FAB has FA = FB. Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle with base AB and equal sides FA and FB. 

But we know that angle at F between FA and FB is the angle between FA and FB. Wait, but we don't know that angle. Wait, angle AFB is the central angle between A and B, so it's equal to the measure of arc AB. 

But how does that help? Well, if I can find that angle, then I can find arc AB. But I don't know angle AFB directly.

However, we might relate it to other parts. For example, if I can find angle at A or B in triangle FAB.

But without more info, this might not help. Let me think.

Wait, we also have point D on the circle with arc DA = 50 degrees. So if I can relate point D to other points.

Another approach: Let's consider all the arcs. Total circle is 360 degrees. Known arcs:

arc CB = 90 degrees.

arc DA = 50 degrees.

Let me try to find other arcs.

If I can find arc AC, arc CE, and arc EB, etc., to add up to 360.

But how?

Let me consider that points A, C, E are on the circle. Let's say arc AC is x degrees, arc CE is y degrees, arc EB is z degrees, and arc BD is w degrees, and arc DA is 50 degrees. Then:

x + y + z + w + 50 = 360.

But I don't know x, y, z, w. However, arc CB is 90 degrees. Arc CB is from C to B, which may involve some of these arcs. For example, arc CB could be arc CE + arc EB, or arc CB could be arc CA + arc AB, depending on the positions.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to find another relation.

Wait, since arc DA is 50 degrees, and arc CB is 90 degrees, and we need arc ACE. Let me think about possible relationships between these arcs.

If I can find the measure of arc AE, then maybe arc ACE is arc AE minus arc CE or something. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: Since angle DFA is 50 degrees, which is a central angle for arc DA. So arc DA is 50 degrees. If I can find the measure of arc AC, then maybe arc ACE is arc AC + arc CE. But how?

Alternatively, if I can find the measure of arc AE, then arc ACE would be arc AE + arc EC? Not sure.

Wait, maybe there's a property I'm missing. Let me think about the total circle.

Total circle: 360 degrees.

Known arcs:

arc CB = 90 degrees.

arc DA = 50 degrees.

Other arcs: arc AC, arc CE, arc EB, arc BD, arc DA.

But without more info, it's difficult. Let me think if there's any other given info.

We have Line(C,D) and Line(E,F). Line(E,F) means E is on the circle. Line(C,D) means D is on the circle. So points C, D, E are on the circle. 

Wait, and Line(F,B) is given, so B is on the circle. So points B, C, D, E are on the circle. Point A is also on the circle because of Line(A,B) and angle DFA involving F and A.

So all points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle. So the circle has five points: A, B, C, D, E. 

Now, the measure of arc ACE is requested. Let me think about the positions. Let's assume the points are arranged in the order A, C, E, B, D around the circle. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that arc DA is 50 degrees, arc CB is 90 degrees, and we need to find arc ACE.

Let me try to imagine the circle with points A, C, E, B, D placed such that:

From D to A: 50 degrees.

From C to B: 90 degrees.

And we need arc ACE.

Maybe if I can find the positions of A, C, E in terms of other arcs.

Wait, here's an idea. Since arc DA is 50 degrees, and arc CB is 90 degrees, and if I can find the arc from A to C, then add arc CE, but how?

Wait, if I can find the measure of arc AC, then arc ACE would be arc AC + arc CE. Let me try to find arc AC.

Let me consider that arc AC + arc CB + arc BD + arc DE + arc EA = 360 degrees. But this is too many variables.

Alternatively, if I can find arc AC by considering other arcs.

Wait, since arc DA is 50 degrees, and if I can express arc DA in terms of other arcs.

For example, arc DA = arc DC + arc CA, assuming that D to C to A is the path. So arc DA = arc DC + arc CA => 50 = arc DC + arc CA. So arc CA = 50 - arc DC.

But I don't know arc DC.

Alternatively, if arc DA is measured in the other direction, like arc DC - arc CA = 50, but this depends on the direction.

This seems stuck. Maybe I need to consider that since arc CB is 90 degrees, and if I can find arc AC and arc CE in relation to it.

Wait, let's think about the total circle. Let's assume that the points are arranged in the order D, A, C, B, E around the circle. Let me try this.

Starting from D, going through A to C, then to B, then to E, and back to D. Let's see:

arc DA = 50 degrees.

Then arc AC would be from A to C, which would be next. Then arc CB is 90 degrees. Then arc BE would be from B to E. Then arc ED would be from E to D.

Total circle: arc DA + arc AC + arc CB + arc BE + arc ED = 360.

But we don't know arc AC, arc BE, arc ED.

However, we need to find arc ACE, which would be arc AC + arc CE. But arc CE would be arc CB + arc BE, assuming E is after B. Wait, if the points are D, A, C, B, E, then arc CE would be arc CB + arc BE. So arc CE = 90 + arc BE.

Thus, arc ACE = arc AC + arc CE = arc AC + 90 + arc BE.

But we still have too many unknowns.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate arc AC and arc BE through other means.

Wait, what about point E? Since E is on the circle, and Line(E,F) is given. But no other info about E. Unless there's a relation between E and other points.

Wait, maybe there's a symmetrical aspect. Since CF is perpendicular to FB, which gave us arc CB = 90 degrees. Maybe there's a similar relation for other points?

Alternatively, since angle DFA is 50 degrees, and F is the center, maybe there's a relation between DA and other arcs.

Wait, here's another idea: If we can find the measure of arc AE, then since arc ACE is from A to E passing through C, it's equivalent to arc AC + arc CE. But if we can find arc AE, then arc ACE would be arc AE + arc EC? No, that's not helpful.

Wait, let me consider that arc ACE is the same as arc AE minus arc CE if it's the shorter arc, but I'm not sure.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for another approach.

Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But since F is the center, any angle at F is a central angle, so it's equal to the measure of its arc.

Wait, but we have angle DFA, which is at F, so it's a central angle. So arc DA is 50 degrees.

Also, since CF is perpendicular to FB, which is a right angle at F, so arc CB is 90 degrees.

Now, let's think about the remaining arcs. If I can find the measure of arc AC and arc CE, then add them.

Let me assume that points are arranged such that from A to C to E to B to D to A. Let me try to calculate.

Let me suppose that arc AC is x degrees, arc CE is y degrees, arc EB is z degrees, arc BD is w degrees, and arc DA is 50 degrees. Then:

x + y + z + w + 50 = 360.

Also, arc CB is 90 degrees. Arc CB would be arc CE + arc EB, assuming E is between C and B. So y + z = 90 degrees.

So substituting, x + (y+z) + w + 50 = 360 → x + 90 + w + 50 = 360 → x + w = 220 degrees.

Now, we need to find x + y = arc AC + arc CE = arc ACE, which is our target. But we have x + w = 220, but need x + y.

But without knowing w or y, this is still not enough.

Wait, but what is w? arc BD. Point B to D. Let me think about arc BD. If I can find arc BD in terms of other arcs.

But how? Let me think. If I can relate arc BD to other arcs.

Alternatively, since we have arc DA = 50 degrees, and arc BD is w. Let me think about the arc from B to D. If points are arranged as D, A, C, B, E, then arc BD would pass through A, C, or some other points. It depends on the arrangement.

Alternatively, if I consider that arc BD is the same as arc BA + arc AC + arc CD. But this is speculative.

Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to determine. This suggests that my previous assumptions about the arrangement of points are incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that the points are arranged such that arc DA is 50 degrees, arc CB is 90 degrees, and other arcs are determined by the circle.

Wait, maybe I should consider that since arc DA is 50 degrees, and arc CB is 90 degrees, and the total circle is 360, then the remaining arcs must add up to 360 - 50 - 90 = 220 degrees. These remaining arcs would be arc AC, arc CE, arc EB, and arc BD, as before. But without more info, it's impossible to determine individual values.

This suggests that there's missing information, but the problem must have a unique answer, so I must have missed something.

Wait, let me revisit the given predicates. The problem says "In ⊙F, m∠DF A = 50 and CF ⊥ FB." So CF is perpendicular to FB, which we've used for arc CB = 90 degrees. Also, m∠DFA = 50, which is arc DA = 50.

Is there any other angle or arc mentioned? No. But perhaps there's a relation between points A, C, E through other properties.

Wait, the problem asks for m∠ACE. Wait, no, it asks for m∠ACE? No, it asks for m∠ACE, but wait, no, the question says "Find m∠ACE" or "m wide hat ACE"? Wait, original question says: "Find m ∠ ACE". Wait, no, let me check.

Original question: "Find m ∠ ACE." Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m ∠ ACE." Wait, no, looking back:

Original problem says: "Find m ∠ ACE."

Wait, no, looking back at the original problem statement:

The QUESTION is: "In ⊙F, m∠DFA = 50 and CF⊥FB. Find m∠ACE."

Wait, wait! Wait, the original question asks for m∠ACE, not arc ACE. Oh! Wait, this changes everything!

I misread the question. It's not asking for the measure of arc ACE, but the measure of angle ACE. That's different. So I need to find the measure of angle ACE, which is an inscribed angle or some other type of angle.

Oh no, this changes everything. Earlier, I was thinking it was an arc, but it's actually an angle. So angle ACE.

Let me start over with this correction.

So, we need to find the measure of angle ACE. Let me re-express the problem.

Given: In circle F (centered at F), m∠DFA = 50°, and CF is perpendicular to FB (so angle CFB is 90°). Find the measure of angle ACE.

Points: A, B, C, D, E are on the circle (since they are connected to F, which is the center, implying they are on the circumference). Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Line(E,F), Line(C,F), Line(F,B). Also, RightAngle at Angle(C,F,B).

So, let's clarify:

- F is the center of the circle.
- Points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle.
- CF ⊥ FB ⇒ angle CFB = 90°, so arc CB is 90°.
- m∠DFA = 50° ⇒ since F is the center, this is a central angle, so arc DA = 50°.
- Need to find m∠ACE, which is the measure of angle at point C, between points A, C, E.

So angle ACE is an angle at point C, with segments CA and CE. Since points A, C, E are on the circle, this is an inscribed angle or some other angle.

Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle ACE is an inscribed angle, then it would be half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

But first, let's determine what arc angle ACE intercepts. Angle at C, so the angle ACE intercepts arc AE. Wait, no: angle at C, between A and E, so it intercepts arc AE that does not contain C.

Wait, in general, an inscribed angle at point C, with arms CA and CE, intercepts the arc AE that is opposite to C. So the measure of angle ACE is half the measure of arc AE.

Therefore, m∠ACE = (1/2)(arc AE).

So, if I can find the measure of arc AE, then divide by 2 to get the measure of angle ACE.

So, how to find arc AE?

We know arc DA = 50°, arc CB = 90°, and we need to relate arc AE to these.

Let me think about the circle's total of 360°. Let's identify all arcs:

- arc DA = 50°
- arc CB = 90°
- Other arcs: arc AB, arc BC, arc CD, arc DE, arc EA.

Wait, but arc CB is part of the circle. Let me try to express arc AE in terms of other arcs.

Let me consider the circle's full rotation. Let's assume the points are arranged in the order D, A, C, B, E around the circle. Let me try to find the arcs between them.

Starting from D to A: arc DA = 50°.

From A to C: let's call this arc AC = x.

From C to B: arc CB = 90°.

From B to E: arc BE = y.

From E to D: arc ED = z.

So total circle: 50 + x + 90 + y + z = 360 ⇒ x + y + z = 220°.

Now, arc AE would be the arc from A to E, which can be either the short arc or long arc. Depending on the arrangement, but since we're dealing with angle ACE, which is likely the smaller arc AE.

Assuming the points are in the order D, A, C, B, E around the circle, then arc AE would go from A to E through C and B. So arc AE = arc AC + arc CB + arc BE = x + 90 + y.

But we need to find arc AE, which is x + 90 + y.

But from earlier, x + y + z = 220°, so x + y = 220 - z.

But without knowing z, this doesn't help directly.

However, we might find z from other considerations. Let me think about point D and E.

Point D is connected to C (Line(C,D)), so arc CD is part of the circle. From point C to D, which would be arc CD. If the points are arranged as D, A, C, B, E, then arc CD would be from C to D, which would be the arc from C back to D, passing through B, E, and D? No, if the points are arranged as D, A, C, B, E, then arc CD would be from C to D, which would go the long way around the circle, or the short way?

Actually, arc CD could be the arc from C to D that doesn't pass through A. If the points are arranged as D, A, C, B, E, then the arc from C to D would be the arc passing through B, E, D. So arc CD would be arc CB + arc BE + arc ED = 90 + y + z.

But we also know that arc DA is 50°, which is from D to A. If we consider the arc from D to A, it could be the arc DA = 50°, which is the direct arc from D to A, or the longer arc. But since we assumed arc DA is 50°, it's the shorter arc.

So, arc DA = 50°, which is the arc from D to A, which is the direct arc, not passing through other points.

Now, the arc from D to A is 50°, and the arc from C to D is 90 + y + z, as above. But this seems complex.

Wait, but if we consider the full circle, we have:

arc DA = 50°

arc AC = x

arc CB = 90°

arc BE = y

arc ED = z

and x + y + z = 220°.

But we also have arc CD, which is from C to D. If we traverse from C to D, it could be the arc through B, E, D, which would be arc CB + arc BE + arc ED = 90 + y + z.

Alternatively, it could be the other arc from C to D, which would be arc CA + arc AD = x + 50°.

But since arc CD can be measured in two ways, depending on which arc we take. But since we're dealing with the circle, the sum of the two arcs between C and D is 360°. So:

arc CD (shorter) + arc CD (longer) = 360°.

But we don't know which one is shorter.

However, if we assume that the arc from C to D through A is the shorter arc, then arc CD = x + 50°, and the longer arc would be 360 - (x + 50).

But without knowing which is shorter, this is still ambiguous.

This seems too open-ended. Maybe there's another way.

Let me recall that angle ACE is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AE. So if I can find arc AE, then angle ACE is half of that.

But how to find arc AE?

Let me think about the total circle. If I can express arc AE in terms of known arcs.

From earlier, arc AE = arc AC + arc CB + arc BE = x + 90 + y.

But x + y = 220 - z.

So arc AE = 220 - z + 90 = 310 - z.

But I don't know z.

Alternatively, if I can find z from another equation.

What is z? arc ED.

Point E is connected to F, and D is connected to C. But I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, but arc ED is part of the circle. If I can find arc ED in terms of other arcs.

Alternatively, since arc DA = 50°, and arc ED is z, then if I can relate arc ED to other arcs.

But I'm stuck here. Let me think differently.

Let me consider the total circle again. Total is 360°. We have:

arc DA = 50°

arc CB = 90°

Other arcs: arc AC (x), arc BE (y), arc ED (z)

With x + y + z = 220°.

Now, let me think about the position of point E. Since Line(E,F) is given, and E is on the circle. Also, Line(C,D) is given, so D is on the circle. But how does E relate to other points?

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between arc ED and arc DA?

No, not directly.

Wait, but if I can find arc ED in terms of other arcs.

Alternatively, since angle DFA is 50°, and F is the center, and D is on the circle, and A is on the circle. So, as before, arc DA = 50°.

Let me try to consider the position of point A. Since arc DA is 50°, and point D is on the circle, then point A is 50° away from D.

If I can relate point A to other points, like B or C.

Let me think about line AB. Since A and B are both on the circle, and F is the center, then FA and FB are radii. So triangle FAB is isosceles with FA = FB.

So, in triangle FAB, FA = FB, so it's an isosceles triangle with apex at F.

The measure of angle at F, which is angle AFB, is equal to the measure of arc AB. So arc AB = angle AFB.

But we don't know angle AFB directly.

However, we can relate it to other arcs. Let me think.

If I can find arc AB, then I can find angle AFB, and possibly relate it to other
