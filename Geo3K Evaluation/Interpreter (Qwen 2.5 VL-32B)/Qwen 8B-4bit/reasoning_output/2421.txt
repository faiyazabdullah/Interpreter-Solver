MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the structure of the figure. 

So, we have a parallelogram ABCD. The points A, B, C, D are all points. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA are mentioned. Also, there are some properties: Lines AB and CD are parallel, lines AD and BC are parallel. Additionally, there's a perpendicular relationship between line DC and BC. Then, there are specific lengths: AB is 20 units, BC is 12 units. The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.

Wait, hold on. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and BC equals AD. But here, they mention AB is 20, so CD should also be 20. Similarly, BC is 12, so AD is 12. Therefore, the perimeter would be 2*(AB + BC) = 2*(20+12)=2*32=64. That seems straightforward, but waitâ€”there's also a perpendicularity condition between DC and BC. Let me check if that affects anything.

Hold on, in a standard parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. But if one of the angles is a right angle, then it becomes a rectangle. However, the problem states that line DC is perpendicular to line BC. Wait, line DC is one of the sides, and line BC is another side. If DC is perpendicular to BC, then the angle at point C is 90 degrees. But in a parallelogram, if one angle is 90 degrees, all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. But then, if it's a rectangle, adjacent sides would be AB and BC, which are 20 and 12. So perimeter would still be 2*(20+12)=64. But maybe there's something wrong here?

Wait, but the problem says it's a parallelogram, and gives that DC is perpendicular to BC. So that implies that the parallelogram has a right angle at C. Which would make it a rectangle? Because in a parallelogram, if one angle is right, all are right. So then, the sides would be 20 and 12, perimeter 64. But then why give all those predicates? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure isn't a rectangle. Wait, but if DC is perpendicular to BC, then angle at C is 90 degrees. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, then angle at C is equal to angle at A, and angles at B and D are equal. But since angle C is 90, then all angles are 90. Hence, it's a rectangle. Therefore, the sides AB and BC are adjacent sides, so perimeter is 2*(20+12)=64. So answer C.

But let me verify again. Suppose the figure is a parallelogram with AB=20, BC=12, and angle at C is 90 degrees. Then yes, it's a rectangle. Hence, the perimeter is indeed 64. But maybe the problem is not a rectangle because of some other conditions? For example, could there be a case where even though DC is perpendicular to BC, it's not a rectangle?

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. So AB || CD and AD || BC. Now, if DC is perpendicular to BC, then DC is perpendicular to BC. But since AB is parallel to DC, then AB is also perpendicular to BC. So that means AB is perpendicular to BC. So the angle at B is 90 degrees. Therefore, all angles are 90 degrees. Hence, it's a rectangle. Thus, perimeter is 2*(20+12)=64. So the answer should be C.

But wait, the problem mentions "Perpendicular(Line(D,C), Line(B,C))". Line DC is the same as line CD. So DC is perpendicular to BC. So that's angle at C between DC and BC. Which in a parallelogram, since AB is parallel to DC, then AB is perpendicular to BC. So angle at B is 90 degrees. Hence, all angles are right angles. Therefore, it's a rectangle. Hence, perimeter is 2*(20+12)=64. So answer C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, 64.
