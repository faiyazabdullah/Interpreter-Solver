====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have three circles: A, B, and C. Their diameters are given as 10, 30, and 10 units respectively. That means their radii would be half of those, so 5, 15, and 5 units. Points E, D, Z, W, Y, X, and others are involved. There's a line ED that serves as the diameter for all three circles. Wait, how can the same line ED be the diameter for all three circles? That suggests points E and D are common endpoints for all three circles' diameters. So, each circle has ED as its diameter. But wait, the circles might be different sizes, but they share the same diameter line? Hmm, maybe they're all constructed on the same line segment ED, but with different radii?

Wait, but the diameters of the circles are different. For example, Circle A has diameter 10, so radius 5; Circle B has diameter 30, radius 15; Circle C has diameter 10 again, radius 5. But if ED is the diameter for all three circles, then ED must be a line segment that is the diameter for each. But that seems conflicting unless ED is actually varying in length? No, because ED is a single line segment. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the predicates again.

Looking at the given predicates:

IsDiameterOf(Line(E,D), Circle(A))  
IsDiameterOf(Line(E,D), Circle(B))  
IsDiameterOf(Line(E,D), Circle(C))

So, the same line ED is the diameter for all three circles. That implies that ED is a line segment that is the diameter for each of these circles. Therefore, ED must be the same line segment for all three circles. However, since the diameters of the circles are different, this seems contradictory unless ED is a line segment that's being used as the diameter for each circle, but that would require ED to have different lengths. Which isn't possible unless there's some other interpretation.

Wait, maybe ED is not the actual diameter length but just the line segment that serves as the diameter for each circle. Wait, no—if a line segment is the diameter of a circle, its length equals the diameter of the circle. So if ED is the diameter of Circle A, then the length of ED should be 10 units (since the diameter of A is 10). Similarly, for Circle B, ED's length should be 30 units, and for Circle C, it should be 10 units. But this is impossible unless ED is somehow variable, which it's not. This contradiction suggests that my initial understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait, the problem says that ED is the diameter for all three circles. But according to the given data, Circles A and C have diameters of 10, while Circle B has 30. Therefore, ED must be a line segment whose length is both 10 and 30? That's impossible unless there's something wrong with the premises. Alternatively, maybe ED is not a straight line but something else? Or perhaps the line ED is the diameter for each circle in terms of position, not length. Like, ED is the diameter line for each circle, but each circle could have different diameters along that line? That doesn't make much sense. Maybe the line ED is passing through all three circles as diameters? But then how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, but assuming the problem is correctly stated, I need to find another way. Let me think again. Wait, the problem mentions points Z, W, Y, etc., lying on line ED. Also, there are lines AZ, CW, BY which are radii of their respective circles. So, for example, Line AZ is a radius of Circle A. Since AZ is a radius, its length should be equal to the radius of Circle A, which is 5. Similarly, Line CW is a radius of Circle C, so its length is also 5. And Line BY is a radius of Circle B, so its length is 15. 

Also, it's given that AZ ≅ CW, which is stated as Congruent(Line(A,Z), Line(C,W)). Given that AZ and CW are both radii of their respective circles, and since their lengths are equal (as per the equality given: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,W)), 2) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2). Wait, hold on—there's a conflict here. Because earlier, we thought that the radius of Circle A is 5, so LengthOf(Line(A,Z)) should be 5. But the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2). That contradicts the previous assumption. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back to the given predicates.

Looking at the list:

IsRadiusOf(Line(A,Z), Circle(A))  
IsRadiusOf(Line(C,W), Circle(C))  
IsRadiusOf(Line(B,Y), Circle(B))  
Equals(DiameterOf(Circle(A)), 10) → Radius is 5  
Equals(DiameterOf(Circle(B)), 30) → Radius is 15  
Equals(DiameterOf(Circle(C)), 10) → Radius is 5  
Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(A)), 5)  
Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(B)), 15)  
Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(C)), 5)  
Congruent(Line(A,Z), Line(C,W))  
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,W)), 2)  
PointLiesOnLine(Point(Z), Line(E,D))  
PointLiesOnLine(Point(W), Line(E,D))  
PointLiesOnLine(Point(Y), Line(E,D))  
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2)

Oh! Here's the key point. The predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,W)), 2) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2) are given. But according to the radii, Line(A,Z) should be a radius of Circle A, which is 5 units long. But the predicate says it's 2. This suggests that either there's an error in the problem, or perhaps the line segments AZ and CW are not full radii but parts of them? Or maybe they are not radii but something else? Wait, no—the IsRadiusOf(Line(A,Z), Circle(A)) predicate indicates that Line(A,Z) is a radius of Circle A. Then, its length should equal the radius of Circle A, which is 5. But according to the given predicate, LengthOf(Line(A,Z)) is 2. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.

This suggests that there's a mistake in my initial assumptions. Let me re-express the given data carefully.

Given:

- Circle A has diameter 10 → radius 5.
- Circle B has diameter 30 → radius 15.
- Circle C has diameter 10 → radius 5.

Predicates:

- IsRadiusOf(Line(A,Z), Circle(A)) → So AZ is a radius of A, thus its length should be 5. But Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2) says it's 2. Contradiction.

Similarly, IsRadiusOf(Line(C,W), Circle(C)) → CW is a radius of C, so length should be 5. But Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,W)), 2) again says it's 2. Another contradiction.

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless the line segments AZ and CW are not full radii but parts of them? But the predicate explicitly states they are radii. Alternatively, perhaps the line segments AZ and CW are not radii but chords? But the predicate says they are radii. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the line segments AZ and CW are not straight lines but vectors, and their lengths are given as 2. But the problem states that they are radii. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the predicates are interpreted. Let me re-express the given data:

The problem says: "Find Y W if A Z ≅ C W and C W = 2."

So, the question is about finding the length of YW, given that AZ is congruent to CW, and CW is 2.

But according to the given predicates, AZ and CW are radii of their respective circles. But their lengths are given as 2, which conflicts with the radii of the circles. How can this be?

Let me try to reconcile this. Suppose that even though AZ is supposed to be a radius of Circle A, which has diameter 10 (radius 5), the length of AZ is given as 2. That would mean that the radius of Circle A is actually 2, contradicting the given DiameterOf(Circle(A)) = 10. Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup, but since this is a hypothetical scenario, perhaps I need to proceed with the given numerical values rather than relying on the diameter-radius relationship?

Wait, the problem says: "the diameters of ⊙A, ⊙B, and ⊙C are 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively." So that's fixed. Then, the predicates say that Line(AZ) is a radius of Circle A, so its length should be 5. But the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,Z)), 2) says it's 2. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the problem has a typo, or there's a misinterpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the line segments AZ, CW, BY are not radii but something else. Wait, but the predicate IsRadiusOf(Line(A,Z), Circle(A)) clearly states that AZ is a radius of Circle A. Therefore, the length of AZ should be equal to the radius of Circle A, which is 5. But according to the given predicate, it's 2. This is a contradiction. 

However, since this is a problem presented to solve, perhaps we have to ignore the contradictions and proceed with the given numerical values. Let me assume that despite the radii being 5, 15, and 5, the lengths of AZ and CW are given as 2. Perhaps the problem is designed such that even though AZ is a radius, its length is given as 2 due to some other configuration. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line segments AZ, CW, BY are not straight radii but something else. For instance, maybe they are not from the center to the circumference but from some other point? But the predicate says they are radii, implying they start at the center. 

Wait, let's consider that the line ED is the diameter for all three circles. So, points E and D are endpoints of the diameter for each circle. Therefore, the centers of the circles would be the midpoint of ED. However, since the diameters of the circles differ, this suggests that the length of ED varies depending on the circle? But ED is a single line segment. Therefore, this is impossible unless ED is not a straight line but part of a larger structure. 

Wait, perhaps ED is not a straight line but a combination of different segments? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe ED is a line that passes through the centers of all three circles, but the actual diameters are different. For example, each circle has its own diameter along ED, but the length of ED depends on the circle. However, since ED is a single line segment, this is impossible. 

This confusion suggests that perhaps the problem involves overlapping circles with the same line ED as their diameter, but different radii. However, that would require ED to have different lengths, which is impossible. Hence, there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's setup. 

But since this is a problem to solve, I must proceed with the given data, ignoring the inconsistencies. Let me focus on the question: Find YW if AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2.

Since CW = 2, and AZ ≅ CW, then AZ = 2. Now, the question is about YW. 

What do we know about YW? Let me look at the given predicates. 

We have Point(Y) lies on Line(E,D). Also, Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B. Since Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B, its length is equal to the radius of Circle B, which is 15. However, the problem gives us that AZ and CW are 2. 

Now, the question asks for YW. Let me visualize this. Points E and D define a line. Points Z, W, Y lie on this line. 

So, points Z, W, Y are colinear on ED. We know that CW = 2 (so the distance from C to W is 2). Also, AZ = 2 (distance from A to Z is 2). But where are points A, B, C located? 

Wait, the circles A, B, C are mentioned. Each has ED as its diameter. So, the centers of the circles are midpoints of ED. But since ED is the diameter for all three circles, the centers of A, B, and C are all the midpoint of ED. However, if the circles have different diameters, this implies that ED cannot be the same for all three. So, perhaps each circle has ED as its diameter, but ED is extended or contracted for each? This seems confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps points E and D are not fixed but vary for each circle? No, the line ED is the same for all three circles. 

This is getting too tangled. Let's focus on what we can deduce directly from the given data without worrying about the contradictions. 

Given that Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B, so its length is 15. Since Y lies on ED, and B is the center of Circle B. Wait, if ED is the diameter of Circle B, then the center of Circle B is the midpoint of ED. So, the coordinates of B would be the midpoint of ED. Therefore, the distance from B to Y (which is the radius) is 15. So, Y lies somewhere on ED such that the distance from B (midpoint of ED) to Y is 15. 

But how does this relate to YW? We need to find the distance between Y and W. 

Additionally, we know that CW = 2, and W is on ED. Also, Line(C,W) is a radius of Circle C, so the length of CW is equal to the radius of Circle C, which is 5. But according to the given data, it's 2. Again, this is conflicting. 

Assuming that we have to take the given numerical values as absolute, regardless of the radii, let's proceed. 

So, CW = 2, and since W is on ED, and C is a point. Wait, but where is point C located? The circle C has ED as its diameter, so the center of Circle C is the midpoint of ED. So, the center of Circle C is the midpoint of ED. Therefore, the distance from C to W is the radius of Circle C, which should be 5, but the given value is 2. 

Again, contradiction. But perhaps the problem uses a different definition. Let's suppose that despite the diameter being 10, the line CW is a radius of length 2. Maybe the line segment CW is not from the center to the circumference but something else. 

Alternatively, maybe points A, B, C are not the centers of the circles. Wait, the problem refers to circles A, B, C. In standard notation, the circle name usually corresponds to its center. So, Circle A has center A, Circle B has center B, and Circle C has center C. 

Ah! This changes things. If that's the case, then the center of Circle A is point A, Center of Circle B is point B, Center of Circle C is point C. 

Then, the line ED is the diameter of each circle. For example, for Circle A, the diameter is ED, which means that points E and D are the endpoints of the diameter of Circle A. Thus, the center of Circle A is the midpoint of ED. But according to this, the center of Circle A is point A. So, point A is the midpoint of ED. 

Wait, that would mean that point A is the midpoint of ED. Similarly, point B is the midpoint of ED for Circle B, and point C is the midpoint of ED for Circle C. 

But if all three circles have ED as their diameter, then their centers are all the midpoint of ED. So, points A, B, and C must all coincide at the midpoint of ED. But that's impossible unless A, B, and C are the same point. However, the problem lists them as distinct points. 

This suggests that my assumption that the circle names correspond to their centers is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: Let's forget about the circle names being centers. Instead, the circles are named A, B, C, but their centers are not necessarily points A, B, C. 

But then, how are the points A, B, C defined? The problem includes Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), so they are points in the diagram. 

Given that, the line ED is the diameter of each circle. So for Circle A, the diameter is ED, so the endpoints of the diameter are E and D. Therefore, the center of Circle A is the midpoint of ED. Similarly for Circles B and C. 

Thus, the centers of the three circles are all the midpoint of ED. Therefore, points A, B, C must be the same point, the midpoint of ED. But again, this contradicts the presence of distinct points A, B, C. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to move forward with the given data about the lengths. 

We are told that Line(A,Z) is a radius of Circle A. Assuming that the center of Circle A is some point, say O_A, then the line AZ connects point A to Z, and since it's a radius, its length is equal to the radius of Circle A. But the problem says the diameter of Circle A is 10, so radius is 5. However, the predicate says LengthOf(Line(A,Z)) is 2. 

Unless point A is not the center of Circle A. Wait, if the center of Circle A is not point A, but some other point, say O_A, then Line(A,Z) being a radius would imply that Z is on the circumference of Circle A, and A is some point related to the circle. 

But without knowing the location of the center of Circle A, it's hard to determine. 

At this point, I realize that the problem may have a mistake, but since I need to solve it, I'll proceed with the given numerical values and ignore the contradictions. 

The question is to find YW, given that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2. 

From the given data: 
- CW = 2 (given)
- AZ ≅ CW ⇒ AZ = 2
- Need to find YW. 

Points Z, W, Y are on ED. 

Let me assume that ED is a straight line, and points Z, W, Y are on it. 

Assume that the order of points on ED is such that E --- Z ---- W ---- Y ---- D, or some permutation. 

But without knowing the positions, I need to find relations. 

For example, if I consider the line ED, with points Z and W on it. Also, Y is on ED. 

But how does Y relate to other points? 

Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B. Assuming that the center of Circle B is some point, say O_B, then the length of BY is equal to the radius of Circle B, which is 15. 

But since Y is on ED, and O_B is the center of Circle B, which is the midpoint of ED (because ED is the diameter of Circle B). So, the center of Circle B is the midpoint of ED. Therefore, the distance from the center of Circle B to Y is 15. 

Let me denote the midpoint of ED as M. So, M is the center of all three circles (since ED is the diameter for all three). Wait, but that would mean that all three circles have the same center M, which is the midpoint of ED. 

But then, the radius of each circle is half the length of ED. So, for Circle A, radius is 5 ⇒ ED = 10. For Circle B, radius is 15 ⇒ ED = 30. For Circle C, radius is 5 ⇒ ED = 10. This is a contradiction because ED cannot be both 10 and 30. 

But since the problem gives us that ED is the diameter for all three circles, this suggests that ED must have two different lengths, which is impossible. Hence, the only way this works is if ED is not a straight line but consists of multiple segments, or the circles are arranged differently. 

Given this impasse, perhaps I should focus solely on the given numerical values and the question. 

We are told that CW = 2. Since W is on ED, and assuming that C is the center of Circle C (even though this may not be correct), then the distance from C to W is the radius of Circle C, which is 5. But the given value is 2. This suggests that the length of CW is 2, which may be a chord or something else. 

Alternatively, since the problem says "A Z ≅ C W" and "C W = 2", then AZ = 2. 

If I can find the relation between Y and W, maybe through triangle or coordinate geometry. 

Suppose we place the points on a coordinate system. Let's set up coordinates to simplify. 

Let me assume ED is a horizontal line. Let me assign coordinates to points E and D. Let me set E at (0, 0) and D at (d, 0), making ED of length d. 

Since ED is the diameter of all three circles, the centers of all three circles are at the midpoint of ED, which is (d/2, 0). 

But the radii of the circles are different. For Circle A, radius is 5 ⇒ d = 10. For Circle B, radius is 15 ⇒ d = 30. For Circle C, radius is 5 ⇒ d = 10. So, this is inconsistent. 

But since the problem gives us that CW = 2, and assuming that C is the center of Circle C (which would be at (d/2, 0)), then the distance from C to W is 2. So, W is a point on ED at distance 2 from C. 

If C is at (d/2, 0), then W is either at (d/2 - 2, 0) or (d/2 + 2, 0). 

Similarly, AZ = 2. Assuming A is the center of Circle A, which is also at (d/2, 0), then Z is a point on ED at distance 2 from A. So, Z is at (d/2 - 2, 0) or (d/2 + 2, 0). 

But since AZ ≅ CW, and both are 2, this suggests that Z and W are symmetrically placed around the center. 

But how does this help with finding YW? 

Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B. If B is the center of Circle B, which is at (d/2, 0), then Y is a point on ED at distance 15 from B. So, Y is either at (d/2 - 15, 0) or (d/2 + 15, 0). 

Now, the question is to find YW. 

To calculate YW, we need to know the positions of Y and W on ED. 

But the length of ED is determined by the diameter of Circle B, which is 30. So, d = 30. Thus, ED is from (0, 0) to (30, 0), midpoint at (15, 0). 

So, C is at (15, 0) (center of Circle C), and W is at (15 ± 2, 0). Similarly, A is at (15, 0) (center of Circle A), so Z is at (15 ± 2, 0). 

But then, if both Z and W are at (15 ± 2, 0), then they could be at the same position or opposite sides. 

Assuming that Z and W are on opposite sides of the center, then Z is at (15 - 2, 0) = (13, 0), and W is at (15 + 2, 0) = (17, 0). 

Then, Y is at (15 - 15, 0) = (0, 0) or (15 + 15, 0) = (30, 0). 

But Y is on ED, which goes from E(0,0) to D(30,0). So, Y could be at E or D. 

If Y is at E (0,0), then YW would be the distance from (0,0) to W at (17,0), which is 17 units. 

If Y is at D (30,0), then YW would be the distance from (30,0) to W at (17,0), which is 13 units. 

But neither 17 nor 13 are among the answer choices. The options are 2, 3, 10, 30. 

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption about the placement is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of ED is not 30 but something else. Wait, if ED is the diameter for Circle B, which has diameter 30, then ED = 30. 

But what if ED is not the entire line, but just a segment? For example, if ED is the diameter for Circle B, then ED = 30. For Circles A and C, their diameters are 10, so if ED is the same line, then the length of ED must be 30, but their radii would be 5, which would make sense. 

Wait, if ED is 30 units long, then for Circle A and C, their diameters are 10, which would mean that their centers are not at the midpoint of ED, but elsewhere? No, because if ED is the diameter of Circle A, then the center of Circle A is the midpoint of ED, which would be at 15 units from E. But the diameter of Circle A is 10, so ED should be 10. This contradiction remains. 

I'm stuck. Let me try focusing on the given that CW = 2 and AZ = 2. 

Assuming that W is 2 units away from C, and Z is 2 units away from A. If A and C are centers of their respective circles, then their positions are such that the distance from A to Z is 2, and from C to W is 2. 

If ED is the diameter for all circles, then the centers of the circles are the midpoints of ED. So, let's assume that the midpoint of ED is M. Then, the centers of all circles are at M. 

So, A, B, C are all at M. But this would mean that points A, B, C are the same point, which contradicts their existence as distinct points. 

Therefore, this suggests that the problem is ill-posed. However, since the question requires an answer, I must proceed with the given numerical values. 

Let me consider that the question asks for YW, and the options are 2, 3, 10, 30. Given that CW = 2 and AZ = 2, and the answer choices include 2, which is one of the options. But why would YW be 2? 

Alternatively, since Y is on ED and BY is a radius of Circle B (length 15), and W is on ED at distance 2 from C. If I can express YW in terms of these distances. 

Assuming ED is a line of length 30 (for Circle B), with E at 0 and D at 30. Midpoint M at 15. 

Center of Circle B is M. So, BY is a radius, so Y is 15 units from M. So, Y is at 15 - 15 = 0 (E) or 15 + 15 = 30 (D). 

If Y is at E (0), and W is 2 units from C. Where is C? 

If Circle C has diameter ED (length 30), so its radius is 15, but earlier said diameter is 10. Wait, this is the contradiction again. 

But if I ignore the diameter and use the given that CW = 2, and assume that C is the center of Circle C, then W is 2 units from C. If C is at M (midpoint), then W is at M ± 2. 

If Y is at E (0), and W is at M + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17, then YW is 17 - 0 = 17. Not in options. 

If Y is at D (30), and W is at M - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13, then YW is 30 - 13 = 17. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if Y is at M + 15 = 30 (D), and W is at M - 2 = 13, then YW is 30 - 13 = 17. 

No match. 

Alternatively, if the length of ED is 10 (for Circle A and C), then M is at 5. 

So, for Circle B, which has diameter 30, ED would need to be 30. But if ED is 10, then this is impossible. 

This is going nowhere. 

Perhaps the correct answer is 2, as in option A. Since CW = 2 and AZ = 2, maybe YW is also 2. But why? 

Alternatively, since Y is on ED and BY is a radius of Circle B (length 15), and W is 2 units from C. If C is at the midpoint of ED (assuming ED is the diameter for Circle C), then C is at M. So, W is at M ± 2. 

If Y is at M + 15 (D), then YW is |M + 15 - (M ± 2)| = 15 ∓ 2. So, either 13 or 17. Neither are in options. 

If Y is at M - 15 (E), then YW is |M - 15 - (M ± 2)| = |-15 ∓ 2| = 17 or 13. Still no. 

Maybe the answer is 10, which is option C. 

Alternatively, if YW is the difference between the radius of B and CW, like 15 - 2 = 13, but 13 isn't an option. 

Wait, the options are A. 2, B. 3, C. 10, D. 30. 

If I consider that YW is the difference between the radius of B (15) and the radius of A or C (5), giving 10. 

But why? 

If Y is at the end of ED (say, D) and W is at the center minus 2, then YW would be ED length - (center - 2). If ED is 30, then center is at 15. So, YW = 30 - (15 - 2) = 17. 

Not helpful. 

Alternatively, if ED is 10 (for Circle A and C), then the radius of B is 15, which would mean ED is 30. So, if ED is 30, and W is 2 units from C (which is at center 15), then W is at 15 + 2 = 17. If Y is at D (30), then YW = 30 - 17 = 13. Not in options. 

Alternatively, if Y is at E (0), then YW = 17 - 0 = 17. 

Still no. 

Perhaps the answer is 10, which is option C. 

But why? 

Maybe the length of YW is the radius of Circle B (15) minus the radius of Circle C (5), giving 10. 

That would make sense if YW represents the difference between radii. 

But why would YW be the difference between radii? 

If Y is at the end of ED (say, D) and W is at a point such that the distance from W to C is 2, then YW would depend on where C is. 

If C is the center of Circle C, which is at the midpoint of ED (15), and W is 2 units from C, then W is at 15 ± 2. If Y is at D (30), then YW is 30 - (15 + 2) = 13 or 30 - (15 - 2) = 17. 

But if Y is at the other end, E (0), then YW is (15 - 2) - 0 = 13 or 15 + 2 - 0 = 17. 

Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if Y is at the center of Circle B (15), then YW would be 15 - (15 ± 2) = ±2 or ±12. 

If Y is at the center, then YW could be 2, but that's option A. 

But why would Y be at the center? Because Line(B,Y) is a radius of Circle B, so Y is on the circumference. If B is the center, then Y is at distance 15 from B. So, Y cannot be at the center. 

This is extremely confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess. Since the answer choices include 10, which is the radius of A and C, and the question involves comparing radii, maybe the answer is 10.
