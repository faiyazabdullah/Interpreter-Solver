Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have points A, B, C, D. There are several lines mentioned: AB, BC, AC, BD, DC. Triangles formed are ABC, ABD, BDC. Angles at B: Angle ABC, ABD, and DBC. Also, some specific properties: RightAngle at ABD, so angle ABD is 90 degrees. Then there's an equality that measure of angle DBC is 45 degrees. 

Also, there are hypotenuses and sides specified. For example, Line AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, meaning that triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse AC. Similarly, AD is the hypotenuse of triangle ABD, making it another right triangle. Then DC is the hypotenuse of triangle BDC. Wait, but DC is also a side in triangle BDC? Let me check again.

Wait, the predicates say IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) – so AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. So triangle ABC is right-angled at B because the hypotenuse is AC. Because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Therefore, angle at B in triangle ABC is the right angle. But wait, there's also a RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)), meaning angle ABD is 90 degrees. So point D is such that BD is perpendicular to AB. 

Also, Parallel(Line(B,C), Line(D,C)). So BC is parallel to DC. That suggests that maybe triangle BDC has some relationship with triangle ABC?

Let me try to visualize this. Points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, AC form triangle ABC, right-angled at B since AC is hypotenuse. Then BD is perpendicular to AB (since they're perpendicular). So BD is a vertical line if AB is horizontal. Then DC connects D to C, and BC is parallel to DC. Since BC is part of triangle ABC, and DC is connected to point D. Also, angle DBC is 45 degrees. 

Given that angle DBC is 45 degrees, and triangle BDC has DC as hypotenuse. Wait, the hypotenuse of triangle BDC is DC. So triangle BDC is right-angled at B? Because hypotenuse is DC, so right angle would be at B? Wait, but angle DBC is 45 degrees, which is one of the angles. If triangle BDC is right-angled at B, then angle at B is 90 degrees, but we are told angle DBC is 45 degrees. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps triangle BDC isn't right-angled? Wait, the hypotenuse is DC, so the right angle must be at B? Wait, hypotenuse is the longest side opposite the right angle. So if DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle is at B. But angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. Hmm, that would mean that in triangle BDC, angle at B is 45 degrees, and since it's right-angled at B, that would make angle at B 90 degrees. Contradiction. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the hypotenuse is DC, so the right angle is at B? But angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. That can't be. Maybe I misread the hypotenuse. Let me check again.

The predicates state: IsHypotenuseOf(Line(D,C), Triangle(B,D,C)). So DC is the hypotenuse of triangle BDC. Therefore, triangle BDC is right-angled at B. But angle DBC is 45 degrees. Wait, if triangle BDC is right-angled at B, then angles at D and C would sum to 90 degrees. Given that angle DBC is 45 degrees, that implies that angle at B is 45 degrees, but that contradicts being the right angle. So something's wrong here. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Wait, angle DBC is 45 degrees. That's angle at B between points D, B, C. So angle DBC is part of triangle DBC. If DC is the hypotenuse of triangle DBC, then the right angle must be at B. But angle DBC is 45 degrees, which would imply that angle at B is 45, not 90. This contradiction suggests that my understanding is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the hypotenuse is not at B. Wait, hypotenuse is DC. So the right angle must be at B? Or perhaps at another vertex?

Wait, in triangle BDC, the hypotenuse is DC. So the right angle must be at the third vertex, which is B? Wait, no. In a triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. So if DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle is at B. So angle at B is 90 degrees. However, the given angle DBC is 45 degrees, which would be angle at B. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the hypotenuse is not DC. Let me check the original predicates again. It says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(D,C), Triangle(B,D,C)). So yes, DC is the hypotenuse of triangle BDC. So that triangle must be right-angled at B. But angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. How can that be?

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me think again. If triangle BDC is right-angled at B, then angle DBC is 90 degrees. But according to the given, angle DBC is 45 degrees. Therefore, there's a conflict here. Which means that either I'm misinterpreting the hypotenuse, or there's another right angle somewhere else.

Wait, maybe triangle BDC is not right-angled? But the predicate states that DC is the hypotenuse, implying it's a right triangle. Unless the hypotenuse is not DC. Wait, maybe the hypotenuse is BD or BC? No, the predicate explicitly says DC is the hypotenuse. So this seems contradictory. Perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the right angle?

Wait, maybe the right angle is at D? If DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle would be at the third vertex, which is B. Wait, triangle BDC: vertices B, D, C. Hypotenuse DC. So the right angle must be at B. Hence angle at B is 90 degrees. But angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. So this is a contradiction unless angle DBC is not part of the right angle. Wait, angle DBC is at B, between D, B, C. So if the triangle is right-angled at B, then angle DBC is 90 degrees. But given that it's 45 degrees, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the hypotenuse is not DC but BD? Let me check the original predicates again. The predicate is IsHypotenuseOf(Line(D,C), Triangle(B,D,C)). So DC is the hypotenuse. So the triangle BDC has DC as its hypotenuse. Thus, the right angle is at B. But angle DBC is 45 degrees. Therefore, unless there's another explanation.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle BDC is not right-angled? But the predicate says DC is the hypotenuse, which implies it's a right triangle. So this is confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the given data regardless of this contradiction, assuming that there's a way to resolve it.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at D? If DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle would be at D. Wait, in that case, the legs would be BD and DC? No, hypotenuse is DC. So the legs would be BD and BC? Wait, no. In triangle BDC, the sides are BD, BC, and DC. If DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle is at B. So angle at B is 90 degrees. But angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. So that's impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since it's given, I must find a way to reconcile it.

Wait, perhaps angle DBC is not the right angle. Wait, angle DBC is part of triangle BDC. If DC is the hypotenuse, then the right angle is at B, making angle DBC = 90 degrees. But the given is 45 degrees. This contradiction suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which angle is the right angle is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at C? But then DC would be a leg, not the hypotenuse. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Let me try to consider other parts of the problem. We know that AC has length 5. And we need to find y, which is LengthOf(Line(A,B)). Also, there's a RightAngle at ABD, so triangle ABD is right-angled at B. Since AB and BD are perpendicular. Also, BC is parallel to DC. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Points A, B, C forming a right triangle with right angle at B, since AC is hypotenuse. So AB and BC are legs, AC is hypotenuse. Then BD is perpendicular to AB, so BD is like extending from B upwards (assuming AB is horizontal). Point D is somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to AB. Then DC connects D to C, and BC is parallel to DC. Since BC is parallel to DC, then vectors BC and DC are same direction. So vector BC = vector DC? Not necessarily, but direction is same.

Since BC is parallel to DC, then the slope of BC equals the slope of DC. Let me think about coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to simplify. Let me place point B at origin (0,0). Since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, let me assume AB along x-axis and BC along y-axis. Let me denote:

Let’s set coordinate system with B at (0,0). Since AB is a leg, let me let AB be along x-axis, so point A is at (a, 0) for some a. Point C is along y-axis at (0, c). Then AC is hypotenuse from (a,0) to (0,c), length sqrt(a² + c²) = 5, given.

Now, BD is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, BD is vertical. So BD goes upward from B (0,0) along y-axis. Wait, but point D is such that BD is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, BD is vertical. So D lies along the vertical line through B. So coordinates of D would be (0, d) for some d. But wait, point C is already at (0,c). If DC is parallel to BC, which is along y-axis from B(0,0) to C(0,c). So vector BC is (0,c) - (0,0) = (0,c). Vector DC would be from D(0,d) to C(0,c): (0,c) - (0,d) = (0, c-d). Since BC is parallel to DC, which they are both vertical, so that holds.

But also, triangle BDC has DC as hypotenuse. Wait, in this coordinate system, DC is from D(0,d) to C(0,c), which has length |c - d|. The hypotenuse of triangle BDC is DC, so DC must be the longest side. Also, triangle BDC must be right-angled. Where is the right angle?

In triangle BDC, with points B(0,0), D(0,d), C(0,c). All three points lie on the y-axis. So triangle BDC is degenerate? Because all points are colinear. That can't be. Wait, that's impossible. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my coordinate assignment must be wrong.

Ah! Here's the problem. If BC is parallel to DC, and BC is vertical (from B(0,0) to C(0,c)), then DC must also be vertical. So point D must be aligned vertically with B and C. But then points B, D, C are colinear, making triangle BDC degenerate. Which contradicts the existence of triangle BDC. Therefore, my initial assumption that BC is along y-axis and AB along x-axis leads to a contradiction because DC would be colinear with BC, making triangle BDC invalid. So there must be a different configuration.

Therefore, my coordinate system needs adjustment. Let me rethink.

Maybe BC is not vertical. Wait, earlier I assumed AB is horizontal and BC is vertical because triangle ABC is right-angled at B. But if BC is parallel to DC, and DC is a separate line, then BC cannot be vertical if DC is supposed to be parallel. Wait, perhaps BC is not vertical. Let me try again.

Let me consider triangle ABC right-angled at B. So AB and BC are perpendicular. Let me take AB as horizontal and BC as vertical, but then DC must be parallel to BC, which would be vertical. But then D would be along the vertical line through B, leading to degenerate triangle. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption of coordinates is causing the issue. Perhaps BC is not vertical but in another orientation?

Alternatively, maybe BC is not aligned with the axes. Let me try assigning coordinates differently. Let me place point B at (0,0). Let me suppose AB is along x-axis, so A is (a, 0). Since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, BC must be perpendicular to AB. So BC is vertical, hence point C is (0, c). Now, BD is perpendicular to AB, so BD is vertical, hence D is (0, d). Then DC connects D(0,d) to C(0,c), which is vertical line segment. Then BC is from B(0,0) to C(0,c), also vertical. So DC is parallel to BC, which they are, both vertical. But then triangle BDC has points B(0,0), D(0,d), C(0,c). These are collinear, making the triangle degenerate. So this can't be. Therefore, there's a fundamental flaw here.

But the problem includes triangle BDC, so it must be non-degenerate. Therefore, my assumption that BC is vertical is wrong. Wait, but triangle ABC is right-angled at B, so AB and BC must be perpendicular. If AB is horizontal, then BC must be vertical, but then DC would be parallel to BC, leading to degeneracy. This suggests that the configuration is not possible under these conditions, which contradicts the given predicates. Therefore, there must be an alternative arrangement where BC is not aligned with vertical.

Wait, perhaps BC is not vertical. Let me consider AB and BC as perpendicular but not aligned with axes. Let me assign coordinates more carefully.

Let me place point B at (0,0). Let me define AB as some vector, say from B(0,0) to A(a,b). Then BC is perpendicular to AB. Let me choose AB as (a, b), so BC should be perpendicular. The direction of BC would be (-b, a) or (b, -a) to ensure perpendicularity. Let me pick BC as (-b, a) for simplicity. So point C would be at B + BC vector: (0 - b, 0 + a) = (-b, a).

Then, line BC goes from B(0,0) to C(-b, a). Now, DC is parallel to BC. So vector DC should be scalar multiple of BC. Let me find coordinates of D. Since BD is perpendicular to AB. AB vector is (a, b), so BD vector should be perpendicular to AB. The direction of BD could be (-b, a) or (b, -a), but since BD is a line, let me define D such that BD is in a direction perpendicular to AB. Let me assume BD is along the direction (-b, a). Wait, but BD starts at B(0,0). So point D would be along that direction. Let me parametrize BD. Let me say D is at t*(-b, a) for some t. So D(t*(-b), t*a).

Now, DC is parallel to BC. Vector BC is (-b, a). Vector DC is C - D = (-b - (-b*t), a - t*a) = (-b + b*t, a - a*t) = b*(t-1), a*(1 - t). For DC to be parallel to BC, which has direction (-b, a), vector DC must be scalar multiple of (-b, a). So:

[ b*(t-1), a*(1-t) ] = k*(-b, a)

So equating components:

b*(t-1) = -k*b → t-1 = -k

and a*(1 - t) = k*a → 1 - t = k

From first equation: t-1 = -k → k = 1 - t

Second equation gives k = 1 - t, which matches. So this condition is satisfied for any t. So DC is parallel to BC regardless of t. So this works.

Now, triangle BDC has points B(0,0), D(-bt, at), C(-b, a). The hypotenuse of triangle BDC is DC. So DC is the hypotenuse, meaning that in triangle BDC, DC is the longest side, and the triangle is right-angled. Let's determine where the right angle is.

For triangle BDC to have DC as hypotenuse, the right angle must be at B. Let's verify. The vectors BD and BC would need to be perpendicular if the right angle is at B. Wait, BD is from B to D: (-bt, at). BC is from B to C: (-b, a). Their dot product is (-bt)(-b) + (at)(a) = b^2 t + a^2 t = t(a² + b²). For them to be perpendicular, this dot product must be zero. So t(a² + b²) = 0. Since a² + b² ≠ 0 (as AB is a non-zero vector), this requires t=0. But t=0 would put D at (0,0), which is point B, making DC = BC, and triangle BDC collapse. So this is not allowed. Hence, the right angle cannot be at B.

Alternatively, the right angle could be at D or at C. Let's check for right angle at D. For triangle BDC to have right angle at D, vectors DB and DC must be perpendicular. Vector DB is from D to B: (bt, -at). Vector DC is from D to C: (-b + bt, a - at). Their dot product should be zero.

Dot product = (bt)(-b + bt) + (-at)(a - at) 
= -b² t + b² t² - a² t + a² t² 
= t(-b² -a²) + t²(b² + a²)
= t²(a² + b²) - t(a² + b²)
= (a² + b²)(t² - t)

Set this equal to zero: (a² + b²)(t² - t) = 0 → t² - t = 0 → t(t - 1) = 0 → t=0 or t=1.

t=0 gives D=B, invalid. t=1 gives D at (-b*1, a*1) = (-b, a), which is point C. So D=C, which also collapses triangle. Not valid.

Now check for right angle at C. Vectors CB and CD must be perpendicular. Vector CB is from C to B: (b, -a). Vector CD is from C to D: (-b*t - (-b), a*t - a) = (b(1 - t), a(t - 1)). Dot product of CB and CD is:

b*(b(1 - t)) + (-a)*(a(t - 1)) = b²(1 - t) + a²(t - 1) = (b² - a²)(1 - t)

For this to be zero: Either b² = a² or t = 1. If t=1, D is at (-b, a) = C, again collapsing. So only possibility is b² = a² → b = ±a.

Assume b = a. Then, DC is parallel to BC, and triangle BDC has right angle at C. Let's see.

With b = a, then AB vector is (a, a). BC vector is (-a, a). So point C is (-a, a). Then DC vector is from D to C: (b(1 - t), a(t - 1)) = (a(1 - t), a(t - 1)) since b=a. So vector DC is (a(1 - t), a(t - 1)) = a*(1 - t, t - 1) = a*( -(t-1), t-1 ). So DC is a*( - (t-1), t-1 ), which has magnitude sqrt( [a²(t-1)^2 + a²(t-1)^2 ]) = a|t-1|√2.

Now, with right angle at C, and DC as hypotenuse. So the triangle BDC has right angle at C, so the hypotenuse is BD. Wait, but the hypotenuse was supposed to be DC. Wait, no, the hypotenuse is DC. So if the right angle is at C, then DC is the hypotenuse. Wait, in that case, the hypotenuse would be BD? No, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. If the right angle is at C, then hypotenuse is BD. But the predicate says DC is the hypotenuse. So this is inconsistent. Hence, this scenario also fails.

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given predicates. But since the problem is presented, I must have made a miscalculation. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps instead of focusing on coordinates, use the given information about angles and lengths. 

We know that angle ABD is 90 degrees. So in triangle ABD, right-angled at B. Also, angle DBC is 45 degrees. So angle between BD and BC is 45 degrees. Since BD is perpendicular to AB, and AB and BC are perpendicular (because triangle ABC is right-angled at B), then AB and BC are perpendicular. So AB ⊥ BC, and BD ⊥ AB ⇒ BD || BC. Wait, if BD is perpendicular to AB, and BC is also perpendicular to AB, then BD and BC are parallel. But the predicate says that BC is parallel to DC. So BD || BC, and BC || DC ⇒ BD || DC. So BD is parallel to DC. 

But if BD is parallel to DC, then points B, D, C are colinear? Wait, no. If BD and DC are parallel, but D is a distinct point. Wait, if BD and DC are parallel, then the direction of BD and DC is the same. So vector BD is parallel to vector DC. So DC = k * BD for some scalar k. 

But since BD is perpendicular to AB, and BC is parallel to DC, then BC is parallel to BD. Hence, BC || BD. But BC and BD are both starting from B, so if they are parallel, they must be in the same direction or opposite. But since BC is part of triangle ABC, and BD is another line from B. If BC and BD are parallel, then BD is in the same direction as BC. Hence, point D lies along the line extending from BC. Wait, but BD is perpendicular to AB, while BC is perpendicular to AB. Hence, BD and BC are parallel. So BD is in the same direction as BC. Therefore, point D lies along the line BC extended beyond C or B. 

Wait, if BD is parallel to BC, and BD is perpendicular to AB, then BC is also perpendicular to AB, so BD is in the same direction as BC. So D is on the line BC extended. Let me imagine: point B, with AB and BC perpendicular. BD is in direction of BC, so D is along BC extended. But then DC would be along BC, so BC is parallel to DC (since DC is part of the same line). But then triangle BDC would have points B, D, C colinear, making it degenerate. Again, contradiction.

This suggests that the only way for BC to be parallel to DC is if D is placed such that DC is parallel to BC, but not colinear. This requires that BD is not in the direction of BC. But earlier, we saw that BD is perpendicular to AB, and BC is perpendicular to AB, hence BD || BC. So this brings us back to the previous contradiction. 

Perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that BC is parallel to DC. Wait, the predicate says Parallel(Line(B,C), Line(D,C)). So BC is parallel to DC. So DC is parallel to BC. Hence, DC must be in the same direction as BC. So vector DC = k * vector BC. 

Let me consider that. If vector DC = k * vector BC, then point D can be expressed as C + k * vector BC. Wait, vector BC = C - B. So vector DC = C - D = k*(C - B). Hence, D = C - k*(C - B). 

Let me express this: D = C - k*(C - B). Let me write coordinates. Assume B is at origin (0,0). Let me define C as (c_x, c_y). Then vector BC = C - B = (c_x, c_y). Then D = C - k*(c_x, c_y) = (c_x - k*c_x, c_y - k*c_y) = (c_x(1 - k), c_y(1 - k)). 

So point D has coordinates proportional to (c_x, c_y), scaled by (1 - k). 

Now, BD is perpendicular to AB. Let me recall that AB is from B(0,0) to A(a_x, a_y). Vector AB = (a_x, a_y). Vector BD is from B(0,0) to D(c_x(1 - k), c_y(1 - k)). So vector BD = (c_x(1 - k), c_y(1 - k)). For BD to be perpendicular to AB, their dot product must be zero:

AB • BD = a_x * c_x(1 - k) + a_y * c_y(1 - k) = (a_x c_x + a_y c_y)(1 - k) = 0.

Since AB and BC are perpendicular (triangle ABC is right-angled at B), then AB • BC = 0. Vector BC is (c_x, c_y), so AB • BC = a_x c_x + a_y c_y = 0. Hence, (a_x c_x + a_y c_y) = 0. Therefore, (AB • BC) = 0. So the above expression becomes 0 * (1 - k) = 0, which is always true. Hence, for any k, BD is perpendicular to AB. So this condition is satisfied.

Thus, point D is determined by choosing k such that DC is parallel to BC. Now, we also have that in triangle BDC, DC is the hypotenuse. So DC is the longest side, and the triangle is right-angled. Let's determine where the right angle is.

In triangle BDC, with points B(0,0), C(c_x, c_y), D(c_x(1 - k), c_y(1 - k)). Let's compute the lengths of sides:

BD: distance from B to D: sqrt[(c_x(1 - k))^2 + (c_y(1 - k))^2] = |1 - k| * sqrt(c_x² + c_y²).

BC: distance from B to C: sqrt(c_x² + c_y²).

DC: distance from D to C: sqrt[(c_x - c_x(1 - k))² + (c_y - c_y(1 - k))²] = sqrt[(c_x k)^2 + (c_y k)^2] = |k| * sqrt(c_x² + c_y²).

So DC = |k| * BC.

Since DC is the hypotenuse, it must be the longest side. So |k| > 1 or |k| < 1 depending on the sign. Let's assume k > 0 for simplicity.

Case 1: k > 1. Then DC = k * BC, which is longer than BC. Also, BD = |1 - k| * BC. Since k > 1, |1 - k| = k - 1. So BD = (k - 1)*BC. So DC is longer than BD. So the longest side is DC, which is hypotenuse. So the right angle is at B. Let's check.

In triangle BDC, if the right angle is at B, then BD ⊥ BC. But we already have BD ⊥ AB, and BC ⊥ AB, so BD is parallel to BC. Hence, BD and BC are parallel, so they can't be perpendicular unless they are zero vectors. This is a contradiction. Hence, this case is invalid.

Case 2: 0 < k < 1. Then DC = k * BC, and BD = (1 - k)*BC. So DC < BC, BD < BC. Hence, BC is the longest side. But DC is supposed to be the hypotenuse. Contradiction again.

Case 3: k < 0. Then DC = |k| * BC. Let's say k = -m, m > 0. Then DC = m * BC. BD = |1 - k| * BC = |1 + m| * BC. So BD = (1 + m) * BC. So DC = m * BC, BD = (1 + m) * BC. So BD is longer than DC. Hence, the longest side is BD. But DC is supposed to be the hypotenuse. Hence, contradiction.

Thus, the only way for DC to be the hypotenuse is if the right angle is at D or C. Let's explore this.

If the right angle is at D: then BD ⊥ DC. Let's check.

Vector DB = B - D = (-c_x(1 - k), -c_y(1 - k)) = -(1 - k)*(c_x, c_y).

Vector DC = C - D = (c_x - c_x(1 - k), c_y - c_y(1 - k)) = (c_x k, c_y k).

Their dot product is DB • DC = [-c_x(1 - k)] * c_x k + [-c_y(1 - k)] * c_y k = -k(1 - k)(c_x² + c_y²). For this to be zero, either k = 0 (which makes D = C), or 1 - k = 0 (k = 1, which makes D = B), or c_x² + c_y² = 0 (which is impossible). Hence, no solution except degenerate cases. So right angle at D is not possible.

If the right angle is at C: then CB ⊥ CD.

Vector CB = B - C = (-c_x, -c_y).

Vector CD = D - C = (c_x(1 - k) - c_x, c_y(1 - k) - c_y) = (c_x(1 - k - 1), c_y(1 - k - 1)) = (-c_x k, -c_y k).

Dot product of CB and CD is (-c_x)(-c_x k) + (-c_y)(-c_y k) = c_x² k + c_y² k = k(c_x² + c_y²). Setting this to zero requires k = 0, which again makes D = C, degenerate. Hence, no solution.

This suggests that under the given conditions, there's no valid triangle BDC with DC as hypotenuse. This contradiction indicates that there's an error in the problem setup, but since it's given, I must find another approach.

Let me focus on the given angle measures. We know that angle DBC is 45 degrees. Since angle DBC is part of triangle BDC, and DC is the hypotenuse, perhaps using trigonometry.

Let me consider triangle BDC, with angle at B being 45 degrees, and DC as hypotenuse. If DC is the hypotenuse, then in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. But if angle at B is 45 degrees, and it's a right triangle, then the other angles would be 45 and 90, but that would require the triangle to be isosceles. Wait, if angle at B is 45 degrees and it's a right triangle, then the other two angles would be 45 and 90, but that would mean it's a right isoceles triangle. Hence, legs are equal. So if DC is hypotenuse, then legs are BD and BC, and they are equal. Hence, BD = BC.

But angle DBC is 45 degrees. If triangle BDC is right-angled at B, then angle at B is 90 degrees, but given it's 45. Hence, contradiction. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at D, then angle at D is 90 degrees, and angle at B is 45 degrees. Then angle at C is 45 degrees. So triangle BDC is a right isoceles triangle with legs BD and DC, and hypotenuse BC. Wait, no. If right angle at D, then hypotenuse is BC. But the predicate says DC is hypotenuse. Hence, this doesn't align.

Alternatively, if the right angle is at C, then angle at C is 90 degrees, angle at B is 45 degrees, so angle at D is 45 degrees. Then hypotenuse is BD. But the predicate says DC is hypotenuse. So this also doesn't match.

This suggests that the given predicates may have inconsistencies, but since the problem exists, I must proceed with available data.

Let me try to use the given lengths and angles. We know AC = 5, and need to find AB = y. 

From triangle ABC, right-angled at B, so AB² + BC² = AC² = 25. So AB² + BC² = 25.

Also, from triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so AB² + BD² = AD².

From the parallelism: BC || DC. So the ratio of BC to DC is equal to some factor. Also, angle DBC is 45 degrees. Let me consider triangle DBC. If I can find relations between sides.

Since BC || DC, and assuming BC and DC are sides of a parallelogram or something. Wait, but BC and DC are not necessarily adjacent sides. 

Alternatively, since BC || DC, the vector BC is parallel to DC. So DC = k * BC for some scalar k. Let me denote |BC| = m, |DC| = |k|m.

In triangle DBC, using the law of sines or cosines. Given angle at B is 45 degrees. Let me apply the Law of Sines.

In triangle DBC, angle at B is 45 degrees, let's call it ∠DBC = 45°. Let's denote sides:

Opposite ∠B (45°) is DC = |k|m.

Opposite ∠C is BD.

Opposite ∠D is BC = m.

Using Law of Sines: DC / sin(∠B) = BC / sin(∠D) = BD / sin(∠C).

But without knowing the other angles, it's difficult. However, if we assume that triangle DBC is right-angled, even though there's contradictions, let's try.

If triangle DBC is right-angled at B, then ∠B = 90°, but given it's 45°, so no. If right-angled at D, then ∠D = 90°, and ∠C = 45°, making it isoceles. So BD = BC. Hence, BD = BC. 

If this is the case, then from triangle ABD, right-angled at B, AB² + BD² = AD². And BD = BC. From triangle ABC, AB² + BC² = 25. So if BD = BC, then AB² + BC² = 25, and in triangle ABD, AB² + BC² = AD², so AD = 5. But I don't know if this helps.

Additionally, since BC || DC, and if BD = BC, then DC = k * BC. If k = 1, DC = BC, but then D would be such that DC = BC, but direction? Not sure.

Alternatively, if triangle DBC is right-angled at D, with ∠D = 90°, ∠B = 45°, then ∠C = 45°, making it isoceles with BD = DC. So BD = DC.

But from BC || DC, vector DC = k * BC. So if DC = BD, then BD = k * BC. Also, from triangle ABC, BC is a leg. Let me try to relate these.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to use the given that angle DBC is 45°, and BC || DC. Since BC || DC, then the angle between DC and BC is 0°, but angle DBC is 45°, which is the angle between BD and BC. Since BD is perpendicular to AB, and BC is perpendicular to AB, so BD || BC. Hence, BD and BC are parallel. So angle between BD and BC is 0°, but given angle DBC is 45°, which is the angle between BD and BC. This implies that BD and BC are not parallel, which contradicts earlier conclusion. 

This is very confusing. Perhaps the key is to use the fact that in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, and angle DBC is 45°, and BC is parallel to DC. Let me consider coordinates again, but this time not assuming AB and BC are perpendicular.

Wait, no, triangle ABC is right-angled at B, so AB and BC are perpendicular. Let me try to assign coordinates with B at (0,0), A at (y, 0), and C at (0, z), so that AB = y, BC = z, and AC = 5. Then, AB² + BC² = y² + z² = 25.

Now, BD is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is along x-axis from (0,0) to (y, 0), BD is vertical. So D is at (0, w) for some w. Then, DC is from D(0,w) to C(0,z). So DC is vertical line from (0,w) to (0,z), so it's parallel to BC, which is from (0,0) to (0,z), also vertical. Hence, BC || DC. This satisfies the parallel condition.

Now, triangle BDC has points B(0,0), D(0,w), C(0,z). But these are colinear, making triangle BDC degenerate. Hence, this is impossible. So the only way for DC to be non-colinear is if D is not on the y-axis. But BD is perpendicular to AB, which is along x-axis, so BD must be vertical, hence D is on y-axis. Hence, this suggests that the problem is impossible, but since it's given, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps BD is not along the y-axis? Wait, AB is along x-axis from B(0,0) to A(y, 0). BD is perpendicular to AB, so it must be vertical, hence along y-axis. Hence, D is at (0, w). So DC is from (0,w) to C(0,z), which is vertical, hence parallel to BC. But this makes BDC degenerate. 

Unless C is not on y-axis? Wait, no, because triangle ABC is right-angled at B, so C must be on y-axis. Hence, this is a dead end.

Maybe the error is in assuming that BD is along y-axis. Wait, if AB is along x-axis, then BD is perpendicular to AB, so it's vertical. But what if AB is not horizontal? Let me try a different coordinate system.

Let me place B at (0,0), and let AB be arbitrary. Let me define AB as vector (a, b), and since BC is perpendicular to AB, vector BC is (-b, a) or (b, -a). Let me choose BC as (-b, a). So point C is at (-b, a). Then, BD is perpendicular to AB, so vector BD is (-b, a) or (b, -a). Let me choose BD as (b, -a) to be in the direction perpendicular to AB. So point D is at B + BD vector: (0 + b, 0 - a) = (b, -a).

Now, DC is from D(b, -a) to C(-b, a). Vector DC is (-b - b, a - (-a)) = (-2b, 2a). Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(-b, a): (-b, a). So DC is (-2b, 2a) = -2*(b, -a). Vector BC is (-b, a) = -1*(b, -a). So DC is parallel to BC, since DC is a scalar multiple of BC. Hence, this satisfies the parallel condition.

Now, triangle BDC has points B(0,0), D(b, -a), C(-b, a). Let's calculate the lengths:

BD: from B(0,0) to D(b, -a): sqrt(b² + a²).

BC: from B(0,0) to C(-b, a): sqrt(b² + a²).

DC: from D(b, -a) to C(-b, a): sqrt[(-2b)^2 + (2a)^2] = sqrt(4b² + 4a²) = 2*sqrt(a² + b²).

So DC is twice the length of BC and BD. 

Now, the predicate says that DC is the hypotenuse of triangle BDC. So in triangle BDC, the hypotenuse is DC, which is the longest side. Hence, the right angle must be at B. Let's check if triangle BDC is right-angled at B.

Vectors BD and BC: BD is (b, -a), BC is (-b, a). Their dot product is b*(-b) + (-a)*a = -b² - a² ≠ 0. Hence, not perpendicular. So right angle is not at B.

Check if right angle is at D: vectors DB and DC. DB is from D to B: (-b, a). DC is from D to C: (-2b, 2a). Dot product: (-b)(-2b) + (a)(2a) = 2b² + 2a² ≠ 0. Not perpendicular.

Check if right angle is at C: vectors CB and CD. CB is from C to B: (b, -a). CD is from C to D: (2b, -2a). Dot product: b*2b + (-a)*(-2a) = 2b² + 2a² ≠ 0. Not perpendicular. Hence, no right angle in triangle BDC, contradicting the predicate that DC is hypotenuse. 

This suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent, but since the problem exists, I must have made a mistake. Let me try to focus on the angle DBC = 45 degrees. In this coordinate system, angle DBC is the angle at B between points D, B, C. Let me calculate this angle.

Vector BD is from B to D: (b, -a).

Vector BC is from B to C: (-b, a).

The angle between BD and BC is angle DBC. Let's compute it using dot product.

cos(theta) = (BD · BC) / (|BD| |BC|)

BD · BC = (b)(-b) + (-a)(a) = -b² - a².

|BD| = sqrt(b² + a²), |BC| = sqrt(b² + a²).

So cos(theta) = (-b² - a²)/(b² + a²) = -1. Hence, theta = 180 degrees. This is impossible, as angle DBC is given as 45 degrees. So this is a contradiction.

This indicates that the only way for angle DBC to be 45 degrees is if the vectors BD and BC form a 45-degree angle. Let me adjust the coordinates to achieve this.

Let me assume that vector BD and vector BC form a 45-degree angle. Let me set up the dot product:

BD · BC = |BD| |BC| cos(45°).

Earlier, in the previous setup, BD · BC = -b² - a², which is negative, giving 180 degrees. To get 45 degrees, the dot product should be positive.

Let me redefine vector BD. Suppose BD is in a direction such that it forms 45 degrees with BC. Let me assume BD has components (x, y), and BC has components (p, q). The angle between them is 45 degrees, so:

BD · BC = |BD| |BC| cos(45°).

Let me choose specific values. Let me set BC as (1, 1), so it has length sqrt(2). Let me set BD such that it makes 45 degrees with BC. Let me choose BD as (1, 1) as well, but
