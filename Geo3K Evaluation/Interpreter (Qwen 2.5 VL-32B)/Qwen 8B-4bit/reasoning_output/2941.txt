MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):

Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a square ABDC inscribed in a circle K. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. The answer choices are 45, 60, 90, or 180. 

First, I need to recall some properties about squares and circles. When a square is inscribed in a circle, all four vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle. That means the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. Also, the center of the circle should be the intersection point of the diagonals of the square because the diagonals of a square bisect each other at 90 degrees and meet at the center.

Looking at the given predicates, there's a square ABD C. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be ABCD? But the points mentioned are A, B, D, C. Let me check the predicates again. There's a Square(A,B,D,C). So the square has vertices A, B, D, C. Then there's a circle K, and points A, B, D, C lie on the circle K. Also, there's a point F which is the center of the circle K. The radii are given as lines from F to each of the square's vertices. 

So since F is the center, connecting F to each vertex would give radii of the circle. In a square inscribed in a circle, the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diagonals. Therefore, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at F, which is the center. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of a central angle. Central angles are angles whose vertex is at the center of the circle. Since the square is inscribed, the central angles would correspond to the arcs between two adjacent vertices. For example, the arc from A to B, B to C, etc. Each side of the square subtends a central angle. 

Since the square has four sides, the total around the circle is 360 degrees. Divided by four, each central angle would be 90 degrees. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, if the square's vertices divide the circle into four equal arcs, each arc would be 90 degrees. So the central angle between two adjacent vertices would be 90 degrees. However, sometimes people might refer to the angle between two radii that connect to opposite vertices, like from A to C, which would be 180 degrees. But the problem says "a central angle," so it could be either depending on the arc considered.

But looking back at the predicates, there are several angles mentioned. For instance, MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) equals 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(B,F,D) is 90, same with others. These angles are formed at the center F between two radii. Let's see: Angle(A,F,B) would be the angle between FA and FB. Since A and B are adjacent vertices of the square, the central angle between them is indeed 90 degrees. Because the square's sides are each separated by 90-degree angles. 

Wait, but another thought: the diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle. So the angle between two diagonals at the center would be 90 degrees? Or perhaps the angle between a radius and the diagonal?

Alternatively, since the square's diagonals are diameters, they split the circle into two semicircles. So each diagonal is a straight line through the center. The angle between two adjacent vertices, say A and B, connected via the center F, would form a central angle. Since the square's internal angles are 90 degrees, but how does that relate to the central angles?

Let me visualize the square inside the circle. Let's take square ABCD (assuming the order is such that AB, BC, CD, DA are sides). The diagonals AC and BD intersect at F, the center. The central angles would be between consecutive vertices. So from A to B to C to D to A. Each arc AB, BC, CD, DA would correspond to a central angle. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, each of these arcs would be 360/4 = 90 degrees. Hence, each central angle is 90 degrees. 

Therefore, the measure of a central angle here would be 90 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice C. 

But let me verify with the given predicates. The predicates state that the angles at F (like Angle(A,F,B)) are 90 degrees. So those angles are indeed the central angles between adjacent vertices. Thus, the answer is 90 degrees, which is option C.
