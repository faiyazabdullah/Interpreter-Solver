MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have a parallelogram ABCD. That means opposite sides are equal and parallel. The points A, B, C, D are all points, and there are lines connecting them. Also, there are points E and F mentioned, but the question is about angle CD F. Wait, point F isn't defined yet. Hmm, maybe it's part of another construction?

Looking at the given predicates: 

First, Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). So ABCD is a parallelogram. Then, several lines are defined: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(A,D), Line(B,C). Wait, some lines are repeated? Like Line(B,C) appears twice. Maybe that's just emphasizing the sides. 

Then, there are length equalities: Length of AB is 25, BC is 29, CD is 25, DA is 29. So opposite sides are equal, confirming it's a parallelogram. Also, Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(C,D)) and Congruent(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)), which aligns with the properties of a parallelogram. 

Angles: Measure of angle DAB is 49 degrees. Wait, angle DAB would be angle at A between D and B. Then angle ADC is 34 degrees. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. But wait, angle at A and angle at C should be equal? Wait, no. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, but here they mention angle measures. Let me check again.

Wait, the given angles: Measure of angle(D,A,B) is 49°, so that's angle at A between D and B. Then angle(A,D,C) is 34°, which is angle at D between A and C. Then angle(B,C,D) is 54°, which is angle at C between B and D. Also, there's a note that measure of angle(B,C,D) equals measure of angle(D,A,B), which is 49°, but wait, angle(B,C,D) is given as 54°? Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, let me recheck. The given predicates say:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), 49)

Which is angle DAB = 49°.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), 34)

Angle ADC is 34°, since A-D-C is the angle at D.

Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 54)

That's angle BCD = 54°, which is the angle at C between B and D.

But then there's also:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)))

Wait, angle BCD (which is 54°) equals angle DAB (49°)? That contradicts unless there's a mistake. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)))"

So angle BCD equals angle DAB. But according to the previous data, angle DAB is 49°, angle BCD is 54°, which are not equal. This suggests inconsistency unless there's something wrong. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle measures were given as part of the problem, but the equality is a predicate. Wait, the problem says these are given predicates. So maybe some of these are given as facts, others are derived?

Wait, let me list all the angle measures given:

- Measure of angle DAB (angle at A) is 49°
- Measure of angle ADC (angle at D) is 34°
- Measure of angle BCD (angle at C) is 54°
- Then, there's a predicate stating that angle BCD equals angle DAB. But if angle DAB is 49°, then angle BCD should also be 49°, but it's given as 54°, which is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the angles are labeled.

Wait, maybe the angle measures are not all given directly but some are derived from the given equalities. For example, the predicate "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)))" implies that angle BCD equals angle DAB. So if angle DAB is 49°, then angle BCD must also be 49°, but earlier it was stated as 54°, which conflicts. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe I misread the angle labels. Let's clarify:

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB and angle BCD should be equal. Similarly, angle ABC and angle ADC should be equal. However, according to the given data:

Measure of angle DAB is 49°, which would imply angle BCD is also 49°, but in the given predicates, angle BCD is measured as 54°. This discrepancy suggests that either there's a typo, or I've misinterpreted the angle labels.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle measures provided are not all fixed. Let me check again the original problem's predicates:

The given angle measures are:

- MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)) = 49° → angle at A between D and B → angle DAB = 49°
- MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)) = 34° → angle at D between A and C → angle ADC = 34°
- MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) = 54° → angle at C between B and D → angle BCD = 54°

Additionally, there's a predicate that states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))), implying angle BCD = angle DAB. So angle BCD should be 49°, but it's given as 54°, which is inconsistent. Hence, this suggests that maybe some of these angle measures are not fixed, but derived via other relations?

Wait, but the problem says "use the provided predicates", which includes these equalities. So perhaps some of the angle measures are not fixed but are determined by other relations. For instance, angle BCD may be determined by other angle measures.

Let me think again. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ABC = 180°, and angle ABC + angle BCD = 180°, etc. Also, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB = angle BCD, and angle ABC = angle ADC.

Given angle DAB is 49°, so angle BCD should be 49°, but according to the given predicate, angle BCD is 54°. That's conflicting. Unless there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe the angle measures given in the problem are not all accurate, but the equalities are the ones that matter. Wait, but the problem gives us these as predicates, so they must hold.

This suggests that there's an inconsistency unless I've misread the angle labels. Let me double-check the angle labels.

For example, angle(B,C,D) refers to the angle at point C, formed by points B, C, D. So that's angle BCD. And angle(D,A,B) is the angle at A formed by points D, A, B → angle DAB. So according to the given, angle BCD = angle DAB, which would mean angle BCD = 49°, but in the given data, angle BCD is 54°. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the angle measures given are not all fixed. Let me check again the original problem's predicates:

The given predicates include:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), 49) → angle DAB = 49°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), 34) → angle ADC = 34°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 54) → angle BCD = 54°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))) → angle BCD = angle DAB → 54° = 49°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the problem has conflicting data, which can't be. Therefore, there must be an error in interpreting the angle labels.

Wait, maybe the angle labels are different. For example, angle(B,C,D) could refer to angle at point C between points B and D, which is angle BCD. But if that's supposed to equal angle DAB, which is 49°, then angle BCD should be 49°, but it's given as 54°. Hence, this is contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different notation. For example, in some contexts, angle(B,C,D) could be interpreted differently. Wait, no—standard notation is angle at the middle point. So angle(B,C,D) is angle at C between B and D. So that's angle BCD.

Therefore, there's a conflict here. How to resolve this? Perhaps the problem contains an error, but assuming that the given predicates are consistent, maybe some of the angle measures are not directly given but are derived via other relations.

Wait, maybe the measure of angle BCD is not given as 54°, but instead, the equality is given. Let me check again the original problem statement.

Original problem's predicates:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 54)

Yes, that's one of the given predicates. So angle BCD is 54°, and also Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))), meaning angle BCD equals angle DAB. Which would require angle DAB to be 54°, but it's given as 49°. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a problem here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angle measures. Let me try to consider that maybe some of the given angle measures are not fixed but are derived from other information. For example, angle ADC is given as 34°, and angle ADC is equal to angle ABC because in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary.

Wait, if angle ADC is 34°, then angle ABC is also 34°, and the sum of angle ABC and angle BCD should be 180°, so angle BCD = 180° - 34° = 146°. But according to the given, angle BCD is 54°, which doesn't fit. So this is conflicting.

Hmm, this suggests that the given data is inconsistent, which is problematic. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, there must be a way to reconcile these. Maybe I need to look for other relationships.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves triangle properties or other figures beyond the parallelogram. There are points E and F mentioned, though they're not defined. The question asks for m∠CDF. So point F is involved. 

Since the question is about ∠CDF, which is the angle at point D between points C and F. But where is point F located? It's not specified in the given predicates. This suggests that maybe point F is constructed in some way based on the existing elements. For example, maybe F lies on a particular line or is connected via a segment.

But without explicit definitions of point F, this is tricky. However, looking back at the given predicates, there's a line AD and line BC. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. So AD is parallel to BC. If point F is somewhere along these lines or extensions?

Alternatively, maybe F is a point such that DF is extended or something. But without more info, this is challenging. However, the problem mentions supplementary angles. For example, Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)). So angle DAB (49°) and angle ADC (34°) are supplementary? Wait, 49 + 34 = 83, which is not 180. That's not supplementary. But the predicate says they are supplementary. Another contradiction. 

Wait, the given predicates include Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)). So angle DAB and angle ADC are supplementary. But 49 + 34 = 83 ≠ 180. Again, contradiction. So there's something wrong here. 

This suggests that the initial assumptions about the given angle measures may be incorrect. Perhaps the angle measures given are not the actual measures, but rather the relationships. Wait, but the problem says "given predicates", which include specific numerical values. 

This is confusing. Given that the problem is solvable, perhaps I need to reinterpret the given angle measures. Maybe the angle measures are not all directly given but some are derived via other relations. Let me try to approach this systematically.

Starting over:

We have a parallelogram ABCD. So AB || CD, AD || BC, AB=CD=25, AD=BC=29. Angles: 

- Angle DAB = 49° (angle at A)
- Angle ADC = 34° (angle at D)
- Angle BCD = 54° (angle at C)
- Also, angle BCD equals angle DAB (from the predicate), so 54° = 49°? No. Not possible. So maybe the angle measures given are not the actual values but are parts of equations?

Wait, maybe the problem uses variables for some angles and provides equations. But the way the predicates are written suggests they are fixed numbers. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mix-up between angles. For example, angle at A (DAB) is 49°, angle at D (ADC) is 34°, and angle at C (BCD) is 54°. Then, since in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ADC should be 180°, but 49+34=83≠180. Not matching. Hence, contradiction. 

This indicates that the given data is inconsistent, making it impossible to solve. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have misunderstood something. 

Perhaps the angle measures given are not all angles of the parallelogram but involve other points. Wait, the question is about angle CDF. Point F is not part of the parallelogram. Maybe F is a new point created by extending sides or constructing triangles?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves triangle CDF, and we need to find its measure. To do that, we might need to use other information like triangle properties, exterior angles, or something else. 

Assuming that despite the contradictions in angle measures, there's a way to proceed. Let's focus on what we can derive.

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB = angle BCD, and angle ABC = angle ADC. Given that angle DAB is 49°, angle BCD should also be 49°, but the given measure is 54°. This suggests that either the given data is incorrect, or the angle labels are different. 

Wait, maybe angle BCD is not the same as angle at C. Let me visualize the parallelogram ABCD. Points in order: A, B, C, D. So sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Thus, angle at C is between B, C, D → angle BCD. If angle DAB is 49°, then angle BCD should be 49°, but given as 54°. So this is conflicting. 

Another possibility: perhaps the given angle measures are not all internal angles of the parallelogram. For example, maybe some angles are external. Or maybe the diagram is not a standard parallelogram. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angle measures are not all in the parallelogram. For example, angle ADC is 34°, which is an internal angle, while angle BCD is 54°, which is another internal angle. But in that case, the sum of consecutive angles should be 180°. 

Let me compute: angle DAB (49°) + angle ADC (34°) = 83°, which is not 180°, so that's not possible. Hence, contradiction again.

At this point, I realize there must be a misunderstanding in how the angles are labeled. Let me try to draw the parallelogram mentally. 

Let me label the points: A at bottom left, B at bottom right, C at top right, D at top left. So sides AB and DC are horizontal, AD and BC are vertical. Wait, but in that case, angle DAB would be the angle at A between DA and AB. If DA is vertical and AB is horizontal, then angle DAB would be 90°, which contradicts the given 49°. So this suggests that the parallelogram is not a rectangle, hence angles are oblique.

But regardless of the shape, the properties still hold: opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle DAB is 49°, then angle BCD should be 49°, and angle ABC and ADC should be 180 - 49 = 131°. 

However, the given data says angle ADC is 34°, which would make angle ABC also 34°, leading to angle BCD being 180 - 34 = 146°, conflicting with the given 54°. 

This contradiction suggests that the given angle measures might not all belong to the parallelogram. Perhaps some of the angles are referring to other figures, or there's a typo in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle measures provided are not all of the parallelogram's angles. For example, angle ADC is 34°, which might be an angle involving point E or F. But the question is about angle CDF, which involves point F. 

Since point F is not defined, perhaps it's part of a triangle or extension. For example, maybe F is a point on side BC or AD, or an intersection of certain lines. Without knowing where F is, it's hard to determine the angle. 

But since the problem asks for m∠CDF, and given that there are supplementary angle predicates, maybe we can find relationships between angles. 

Let me try to consider the supplementary angles. The given predicates include:

- Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)): angle DAB and angle ADC are supplementary. But according to given measures, 49 + 34 = 83 ≠ 180, so this is not true. Hence, contradiction again. 

Unless the actual measures are different. Suppose angle DAB is x, angle ADC is y, and they are supplementary. So x + y = 180. Also, angle BCD is x (since it's equal to angle DAB). Angle at C is x, angle at D is y, angle at B is y, angle at A is x. 

But given that angle ADC is 34°, then y = 34°, so x = 180 - 34 = 146°. But the given angle DAB is 49°, which would be x = 49°, contradicting. 

Thus, the given data seems inconsistent. However, since the problem is posed, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the given angle measures are not all from the parallelogram but involve other constructs. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles mentioned are not internal angles of the parallelogram. For example, angle(D,A,B) could be an external angle. 

Let me assume that the given angle measures are correct, and try to work with them despite the apparent contradictions. 

So, angle DAB = 49°, angle ADC = 34°, angle BCD = 54°. Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB = angle BCD → 49 = 54? No. Not possible. 

But there's a predicate saying Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))). So angle BCD = angle DAB → 54 = 49. Still contradiction. 

Maybe the problem involves triangle CDF, and the angle CDF is related to other angles. Let's suppose that F is a point such that DF is drawn, forming triangle CDF. 

To find m∠CDF, we might need to know other angles in the triangle. If we can find two other angles, we can calculate the third. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, maybe DF is parallel to some side, creating alternate interior angles. 

But without knowing where F is, it's difficult. However, the presence of points E and F might be relevant. Wait, the predicates include Point(E) and Point(F), but no information about them. Maybe F is a point on line AB or BC? 

Alternatively, since there are lines like Line(A,D), Line(B,C), and the problem mentions supplementary angles, maybe F is the intersection of diagonals or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps F is a point such that DF is an extension of some line. 

But since I don't have enough information about F, this is challenging. However, the problem might expect using the given angle measures and relationships to find the desired angle. 

Let me try focusing on what I can derive from the given data, ignoring the inconsistencies for now. 

Given that ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB || CD and AD || BC. 

From the lengths: AB = CD = 25, AD = BC = 29. 

Now, angles: 

- Angle DAB = 49°
- Angle ADC = 34°
- Angle BCD = 54°
- Also, angle BCD = angle DAB (from the predicate), so 54 = 49, which is impossible. 

But maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and one of the angle measures is different. Assuming that angle BCD is actually equal to angle DAB, then angle BCD should be 49°, not 54°. Perhaps the given measure of 54° is a red herring or a typo. 

Let me proceed under the assumption that angle BCD is 49°, and angle ADC is 34°, and angle DAB is 49°, making angle ADC = 180 - 49 = 131°, which contradicts the given 34°. 

This is very confusing. Perhaps I should focus on the supplementary angles mentioned in the predicates. 

Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)): angle DAB and angle ADC are supplementary. So 49 + 34 = 83 ≠ 180. Not supplementary. Hence, contradiction. 

But if we take angle ADC as 180 - 49 = 131°, then angle ADC would be 131°, and the given measure is 34°, which is not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle measures are not of the parallelogram itself but of some other figure. 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find the answer using the given answer choices and see which fits. 

The question asks for m∠CDF. Let's assume that F is a point such that DF is a diagonal or something. 

In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, but without knowing where F is, it's hard. 

Alternatively, since there's a supplementary angle relationship between angle DAB (49°) and angle ADC (34°), even though they aren't supplementary, maybe there's another relation. 

Wait, the given predicates include Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)), so angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°. But given 49 + 34 = 83, which is not 180. This suggests that the actual measures are different. 

Maybe the actual measure of angle ADC is 180 - 49 = 131°, and the given 34° is a mistake. Let's assume that. 

If angle ADC is 131°, then angle ABC is also 131°, and angle BCD = 49°, which matches the predicate that angle BCD = angle DAB (49°). 

Then, the given measure of angle BCD as 54° is likely a mistake, and we should ignore it. 

With that, let's proceed. 

So, if angle DAB = 49°, angle ADC = 131°, angle BCD = 49°, angle ABC = 131°. 

Now, the question is about angle CDF. Assuming F is a point such that DF is drawn. 

If F is on BC, then angle CDF would depend on where F is. Alternatively, if F is the intersection of diagonals, but in a parallelogram, diagonals intersect at midpoint. 

Alternatively, maybe F is a point such that CF is drawn, forming triangle CDF. 

Without knowing where F is, it's challenging, but perhaps there's a way to deduce it from the given information. 

Another approach: since there's a supplementary angle between angle BCD and angle CDA. Wait, the given predicate says Supplementary(Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A)). Angle BCD (at C) and angle CDA (which is angle ADC at D). So angle BCD + angle ADC = 180°. 

If angle BCD is 49°, and angle ADC is 131°, then 49 + 131 = 180°, which works. So this suggests that angle ADC is 131°, not 34°. Thus, the given measure of 34° is likely incorrect or a distraction. 

Similarly, the measure of angle ADC is given as 34°, but if it should be 131°, then the given 34° is possibly a typo. 

Assuming that, let's proceed. 

So, angle ADC = 131°, angle DAB = 49°, angle BCD = 49°, angle ABC = 131°. 

Now, what about the other angle measures? The given measure of angle(A,D,C) is 34°, which would be angle ADC, but we've determined it should be 131°. So this is conflicting. 

But perhaps the given measure of 34° refers to a different angle. For example, maybe it's an angle involving point E or F. 

Since the question is about angle CDF, let's assume that F is a point such that DF is drawn, and we need to find angle CDF. 

Assume F is a point on line BC such that DF intersects BC at F. Or F is on AB. 

Alternatively, since there's a line AD and line BC, which are parallel. If F is on BC, then DF would form a transversal. 

Let me try to imagine triangle CDF. If DF is drawn from D to F on BC, then angle CDF is at D, between C and F. 

In this case, to find angle CDF, we might need to use triangle properties. 

Let me attempt to calculate using the given lengths. 

AB = 25, BC = 29, CD = 25, DA = 29. 

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals bisect each other. Let's calculate the diagonals using the law of cosines. 

For diagonal AC: 
Using triangle ABC, where AB = 25, BC = 29, and angle at B. Wait, angle at B is angle ABC, which is 131° (as per above). So using the law of cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle ABC)
= 25² + 29² - 2*25*29*cos(131°)

But calculating this requires knowing the cosine of 131°, which is negative. 

Alternatively, since we might not need the exact lengths, but focus on angles. 

Alternatively, since we need to find angle CDF, let's consider triangle CDF. To find this angle, we might need to know other angles or sides. 

But without knowing where F is, this is challenging. 

Wait, the problem mentions supplementary angles. One of the predicates is Supplementary(Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A)). Angle BCD (49°) and angle CDA (131°) add up to 180°, which makes sense. 

Also, there's another supplementary angle pair: Supplementary(Angle(D,A,B), Angle(A,D,C)), which would be angle DAB (49°) and angle ADC (131°), adding to 180°, which is correct. 

So assuming that the given measure of angle ADC is 131°, not 34°, and the 34° is a mistake. 

Now, with that, let's proceed. 

If angle ADC is 131°, then in triangle ADC, we have angle at D is 131°, angle at C is 49° (angle BCD), and angle at A is angle DAC. Wait, but in triangle ADC, the angles would be at A, D, and C. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram, angle at A is DAB = 49°, which is angle between DA and AB. In triangle ADC, angle at A is angle between DA and AC, not sure. 

This is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to consider the triangle CDF. 

Assuming that F is a point on BC such that DF is drawn, forming triangle CDF. 

In this case, angle CDF is at D, between C and F. To find this angle, we might need to find other angles in the triangle. 

If I can find angle at C or angle at F, then I can find angle CDF. 

But without knowing where F is, it's hard. 

Wait, another idea: since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is parallel to BC. So if we draw DF, which is a line from D to F on BC, then DF creates a transversal with AD and BC. 

If F is on BC, then DF intersects BC at F. Let's assume F is a point such that DF is parallel to AB. But why? 

Alternatively, since AD is parallel to BC, and if DF is drawn such that it forms a certain angle. 

Alternatively, maybe F is the intersection of diagonals. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So the diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, the midpoint. If F is point O, then angle CDF would be the angle at D between C and O. 

But without knowing where F is, it's hard to tell. 

Given the lack of information about F, and the fact that the answer options are A. 34, B. 43, C. 47, D. 77, I need to find a way to connect the given data to these options. 

Let me consider that angle CDF might be related to other angles. For example, if DF is parallel to AB, then angle CDF would be equal to angle DAB due to corresponding angles. But angle DAB is 49°, which is not among the options except if there's a calculation. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is supplementary to angle ADC. But angle ADC is 131°, so 180 - 131 = 49°, which is not in the options. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is part of a triangle where we can apply the law of sines or cosines. 

Wait, let's assume that F is a point such that DF is perpendicular to BC. But without knowing, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since there's an angle measure of 34° given, which is one of the options, maybe it's related. 

If angle CDF is 34°, that would be option A. But why?

Alternatively, since angle ADC is 131°, and if angle CDF is part of it, subtracting some angle. 

But without more information, it's challenging. 

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose from the options, I'll try to infer. 

Assuming that angle CDF is supplementary to angle ADC, which is 131°, giving 49°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is equal to angle DAB (49°), but not in the options. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is complementary to some angle. 

Wait, another approach: since angle ADC is 131°, and angle BCD is 49°, then in triangle CDF, if DF is a line from D to F on BC, then angle at D (CDF) plus angle at C (BCD) plus angle at F equals 180. But without knowing angle at F, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if F is such that DF is parallel to AB, then angle CDF would be equal to angle DAB (49°), but again not in the options. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is 180 - angle ADC - angle BCD = 180 - 131 - 49 = 0°, which is impossible. 

This is really perplexing. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct answer is B. 43°, as it's the difference between 49 and 8, or some calculation. 

Alternatively, considering the given angle measures of 49°, 34°, and 54°, and the supplementary relationships, perhaps angle CDF is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, another thought: since angle ADC is 131°, and angle ADC is composed of angle CDF and another angle. If F is on DC, then... no. 

I think I've exhausted my ideas. Given the options, and assuming that the correct answer is derived from the given supplementary angles, maybe angle CDF is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, the given angle measures are 49°, 34°, 54°, and supplementary relationships. If angle CDF is supplementary to angle BCD (54°), then it would be 126°, not in options. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is the supplement of angle DAB (49°), it would be 131°, not in options. 

Alternatively, if angle CDF is the difference between 54° and 34°, which is 20°, not in options. 

I'm truly stuck. Given that, I'll guess option B. 43°, as it's a common angle in such problems, but this is a shot in the dark.
