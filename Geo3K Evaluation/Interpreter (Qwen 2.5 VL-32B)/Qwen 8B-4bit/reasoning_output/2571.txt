MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two chords in a circle, EF and HG. Their lengths are given as expressions in terms of x. The question is to find the value of x. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Oh right, there's a theorem about chords in a circle. Wait, if two chords are equal in length, then they must subtend equal angles at the center. But here, the chords aren't necessarily equal; instead, their lengths are given as equations involving x. However, since both chords are part of the same circle, maybe there's something else?

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the chords are equal. So maybe there's another approach. Let me think. Since both chords are in the same circle, their lengths depend on their distance from the center. But unless we know more about their positions, like if they're perpendicular or something, maybe that's not helpful. 

Wait, hold on. Are there any other constraints? The problem gives us the lengths of the chords as 8x + 6 and 10x - 4. But without knowing anything else about the circle or the chords' positions, how can we relate these two expressions? Maybe there's missing information? Or perhaps there's an assumption that the chords are equal? Wait, but the problem doesn't say that. Hmm.

Wait, wait! Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The problem says both chords are in the same circle, so maybe they are actually equal? Because if they were different, there would be more info needed. But the problem didn't mention equality. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, but assuming the problem is correct, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are diameters? But diameters are the longest possible chords in a circle. But the problem doesn't specify that. So unless there's more information, I don't see how to connect these two equations. 

Wait, but the problem gives us two different expressions for chord lengths. Unless there's another condition that links them. For example, if the chords are perpendicular bisectors or something. But without any such information, how can we proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to realize that both chords are in the same circle, so their lengths must satisfy certain conditions. But without more data, like radius or angles, how can we find x? This seems impossible. Maybe there's an error in my understanding.

Hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem states that Line(E,F) and Line(H,G) are both chords of the same circle C. Then their lengths are given as 8x+6 and 10x-4. The question is to find x. 

But unless there's more constraints, there's infinitely many solutions for x. Because for any x, those could be lengths of chords in a circle depending on the radius and position. Therefore, there must be some missing piece here. Wait, maybe the chords are equal? That would make sense. If they are equal, then setting the two expressions equal would allow solving for x. 

But why would the chords be equal? The problem doesn't state that. But perhaps it's implied? Or maybe the problem assumes that both chords are equal? Otherwise, there's insufficient information. Given that the answer choices are numerical, it suggests that there's a unique solution, so maybe the chords are meant to be equal. 

So, proceeding under the assumption that the two chords are equal, because otherwise the problem is unsolvable. So set 8x +6 = 10x -4. Solving this equation:

8x +6 = 10x -4  
Subtract 8x from both sides: 6 = 2x -4  
Add 4 to both sides: 10 = 2x  
Divide by 2: x = 5. 

Looking at the answer choices, B is 5. So that would be the answer. 

But wait, why assume the chords are equal? The problem doesn't explicitly state that. Is there a reason to believe that? Well, maybe the problem has a mistake, but given that the answer choices require a unique solution, and the only way to get that is by equating the two expressions. Therefore, even though the problem may be incomplete, the intended answer is likely B, 5. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Like, if one chord is twice the other or something, but that's not indicated. Without further info, the only possibility is that the chords are equal. Hence, solving 8x+6=10x-4 gives x=5, which is option B. 

Therefore, the answer should be B.
