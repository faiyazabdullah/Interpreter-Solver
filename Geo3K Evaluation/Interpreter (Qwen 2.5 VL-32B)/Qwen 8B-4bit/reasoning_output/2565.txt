MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. Let me start by listing out each predicate and categorizing them.

So, the problem mentions several things. There's a Triangle(X, A, B). That means points X, A, and B form a triangle. Then there are Point(X), Point(A), Point(B) – so all three are points. Then there are Line(X, A), Line(A, B), Line(X, B). So those are lines connecting the respective points. Also, Angle(X, A, B) refers to the angle at point A between points X and B? Wait, no. In standard terms, Angle(X, A, B) would be the angle at vertex A formed by the points X, A, B. Wait, but usually angles are denoted as Angle(A, B, C) where the middle letter is the vertex. So here, Angle(X, A, B) would be the angle at point A between segments AX and AB. Hmm. But the problem also says RightAngle(Angle(X, A, B)), meaning that angle at A is a right angle. 

Then there's Right(Triangle(X, A, B)) – so the triangle is a right triangle. Since we have a right angle at A, that implies that the triangle is right-angled at A. Therefore, sides AX and AB are the legs, and XB is the hypotenuse. Wait, but let me check the other predicates.

Looking at Equals(LengthOf(Line(X, A)), 5) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(X, B)), 13). So the length from X to A is 5 units, and the length from X to B is 13 units. Wait, but if the triangle has vertices X, A, B, then the sides are XA, AB, and XB. But since it's a right triangle at A, the hypotenuse should be opposite the right angle. The right angle is at A, so the hypotenuse would be the side opposite A, which is XB. Therefore, XB is the hypotenuse. 

Now, PythagoreanTheorem(Line(X, A), Line(A, B), Line(X, B)) – this seems to confirm that these three lines satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. Here, the legs would be XA and AB, and the hypotenuse is XB. 

But wait, we know XA is 5, XB is 13. So if we use the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AB. Let me compute that. 

Let me write down the formula: XA² + AB² = XB². Plugging in the numbers: 5² + AB² = 13² → 25 + AB² = 169 → AB² = 169 - 25 = 144 → AB = 12. So AB is 12 units long. 

Now, the question asks for tan X. Wait, angle X. Wait, in the triangle, angle X is at point X. Wait, but the angle at X would be one of the non-right angles. Let me clarify. 

In triangle XAB, with right angle at A. The angles are at points X, A, and B. The right angle is at A. So angle at X is one of the acute angles. To find tan(angle at X), which is opposite over adjacent relative to angle X. 

In a right triangle, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent. For angle X, the opposite side would be AB (since angle X is at X, so opposite side is AB), and the adjacent side is XA. Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. 

At angle X, the two sides forming the angle are XA and XB. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle XAB, angle at X is formed by sides XA and XB. Wait, but in a triangle, each angle is between two sides. So angle at X is between sides XA and XB. However, since the triangle is right-angled at A, the sides XA and AB are perpendicular. So perhaps I need to consider the triangle's structure more carefully. 

Wait, maybe I should draw the triangle mentally. Let me imagine triangle XAB with right angle at A. So point A is the right angle. Points X, A, B are connected such that XA and AB are the legs, and XB is the hypotenuse. So, angle at X is between XA and XB. Wait, but how do we find tan(angle at X)? 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the sides relative to angle X. In a right triangle, tan(theta) is opposite over adjacent. But theta is angle at X. Let's see. 

In triangle XAB, right-angled at A. So, angle at X is adjacent to side XA and opposite to side AB. Because, looking at angle X: the side opposite to angle X is AB, and the side adjacent is XA. Therefore, tan(angle X) = AB / XA. 

Since AB is 12 and XA is 5, tan(X) = 12/5. Wait, but that would make the answer D. However, let me verify once again. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the sides. Let me recall that in a right triangle, for angle theta, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent. So, if angle X is at vertex X, then the sides relative to angle X are: the opposite side is AB, and the adjacent side is XA. Hence, tan(X) = AB/XA = 12/5. Which is 12 divided by 5, so that's answer D. 

But let me check if there's another way. Suppose someone confuses the angle at X with something else. Alternatively, could the angle at X be part of some other configuration? 

Wait, the problem states that the angle is Angle(X, A, B), which was determined to be a right angle. Wait, but earlier I thought that the right angle is at A. Let me re-examine that. 

The predicate RightAngle(Angle(X, A, B)) indicates that the angle at A is a right angle. Because the angle is denoted as Angle(X, A, B), which is the angle at A between points X and B. Therefore, the right angle is indeed at A. Thus, the triangle is right-angled at A, making XA and AB the legs, and XB the hypotenuse. 

Therefore, angle at X is one of the acute angles. So, tan(angle X) is opposite over adjacent. Opposite to angle X is AB (which is 12), adjacent is XA (which is 5). So tan(X) = 12/5. Looking at the options, that's option D. 

Wait, but let me check the answer choices again. The options are A. 5/12, B. 12/13, C. 17/12, D. 12/5. Yes, so D is 12/5. 

But let me double-check my logic. Another way: in triangle XAB, with right angle at A, XA=5, AB=12, XB=13. So angle at X is opposite AB and adjacent to XA. So tan(X) = AB/XA = 12/5. Correct. 

So the answer should be D.
