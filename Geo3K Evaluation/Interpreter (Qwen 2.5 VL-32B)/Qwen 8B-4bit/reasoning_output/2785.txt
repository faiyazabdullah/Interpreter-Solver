MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have several points on a circle L, and some angles mentioned. The question is about finding the measure of angle G,X,H, which is denoted as x. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems because there are points on a circle and angles involved. The key here seems to be the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles. Let me go through the given predicates again.

We have points G, H, J, K, A, X all lying on circle L. There are lines connecting these points: Line(G,K), Line(G,H), Line(G,J), Line(K,H), Line(K,J). Also, angles at point G: Angle(G,K,H), Angle(G,A,H), and Angle(G,X,H). Their measures are given as 97°, 110°, and x respectively. 

Wait, the problem states that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,H)), 97), so that angle is 97 degrees. Then MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)) is 110°, and MeasureOf(Angle(G,X,H)) is x. We need to find x.

Now, looking at the predicates related to angles. There's IsInscribedAngle(Angle(G,A,H), Arc(G,H)). That means the angle at point A (with vertex at A) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc GH. And IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), so the angle at X is a central angle over the same arc GH. 

I remember that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. So if Angle(G,A,H) is an inscribed angle over arc GH, then its measure should be half of the central angle over the same arc. But wait, the central angle would be the angle at the center of the circle. However, in this case, the central angle is Angle(G,X,H). Wait, but where is point X located? Since X is on the circle, maybe the central angle isn't directly at the center unless X is the center. Wait, but the problem says that Point(X) lies on circle L. So, the central angle would be at the center of the circle. But how does that relate to the given angle?

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me think again. The Central Angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its subtended arc. An inscribed angle subtending the same arc is half that. 

So, if Angle(G,X,H) is a central angle over arc GH, then its measure equals the measure of arc GH. Meanwhile, the inscribed angle Angle(G,A,H) over the same arc GH would be half of that arc's measure. Therefore, if we denote the measure of arc GH as θ, then MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)) = θ / 2, and MeasureOf(Angle(G,X,H)) = θ. 

But wait, according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)) is 110°, so that would mean θ = 220°, making the central angle x = 220°, but that doesn't seem right because angles in a circle can't exceed 180° unless it's a reflex angle. Wait, but arcs can be greater than 180°, but angles in standard position are typically considered as less than 180°. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the central angle is not over the entire arc GH but another arc. Wait, the problem states that IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), which implies that the central angle is indeed over arc GH. But if the arc GH is more than 180°, then the central angle would be reflex, but angles are usually measured as the smaller one. Maybe I need to check the other given angle.

Another given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,H)) = 97°. This is an angle at point G, formed by points K and H. Let me visualize this. Points G, K, H are connected by lines: G-K, K-H, and G-H. So, angle at G between lines GK and GH. Wait, but since all points are on the circle, triangle GKH is inscribed in the circle. Wait, but angle at G is 97°, which could be an inscribed angle or something else. But how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point or in a triangle. For example, considering triangle GKH. Wait, but without knowing the type of triangle, maybe that's not helpful yet.

Let me focus back on the central and inscribed angles. The problem gives us two angles: one is an inscribed angle (at A) over arc GH, which is 110°, and another is a central angle (at X) over the same arc GH, which is x. According to the theorem, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. Therefore, x = 2 * 110° = 220°, but that's way larger than 180°, which may not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the arc is actually the minor arc GH, and the central angle would correspond to that. But if the inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc would be 220°, which is a major arc. But in that case, the central angle would be 220°, which is possible. But the problem mentions that the angle at X is a central angle over arc GH. So if the arc is the major arc GH, then yes, the central angle would be 220°, making x=220. But none of the answer choices are 220. The options are A.97, B.99, C.110, D.123. So that suggests my reasoning is wrong somewhere.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the arcs. Let me re-examine the problem. The InscribedAngle predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(G,A,H), Arc(G,H)). So the angle at A is an inscribed angle subtended by arc GH. Therefore, the measure of that angle is half the measure of arc GH. Therefore, arc GH has measure 2*110° = 220°. Then, the central angle subtended by arc GH would be equal to the measure of the arc, which is 220°, hence x=220°. But that's not among the answer choices. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the central angle is not over arc GH but over another arc. Wait, the problem says IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), so the central angle is over arc GH. But maybe the arc is the minor arc GH instead of the major arc. In that case, the measure of the inscribed angle would be half the measure of the arc. Suppose the arc GH is the minor arc, then the inscribed angle would be half of that arc. But if the inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc would be 220°, which is impossible for a minor arc. Hence, that suggests that the arc GH must be the major arc, leading to the central angle being 220°, but again, not matching answer choices. 

Hmm, perhaps there's another approach. Let me look at the other given angle: MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,H)) = 97°. What is that angle? It's the angle at point G between points K and H. Since points G, K, H are on the circle, this angle is an inscribed angle. Wait, but which arc does it subtend? The angle at G would subtend arc KH. Because in an inscribed angle, the vertex is on the circumference, and the angle is formed by two chords. So angle at G between K and H would subtend arc KH. Therefore, the measure of angle GKH is half the measure of arc KH. So, arc KH would be 2*97° = 194°. 

Then, perhaps there's a relation between arcs KH and GH? Not sure yet. Let me see if there are other relations. All points are on circle L, so maybe they form certain polygons. For instance, points G, H, J, K are connected via lines. Maybe quadrilateral GKJH or something else? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple points on the circle, maybe we can consider the total circumference. The sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. If we know some arcs, maybe we can find others. 

Earlier, we thought arc GH was 220°, but that leads to inconsistency. Let me check again. If the inscribed angle at A (angle GAH) is 110°, then the arc GH must be 220°, which would imply that the central angle over GH is also 220°, hence x=220°. But that's not an option. So either my understanding is wrong, or there's a different arc involved. 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not the central angle over arc GH, but over another arc. Wait, the problem says IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), so it's definitely over arc GH. 

Alternatively, maybe the central angle is not over the entire arc GH but another arc? No, the predicate says Arc(G,H), so that's the arc from G to H. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at X is not the central angle but something else. Wait, the predicate says IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), so that's a central angle. Therefore, its measure is equal to the arc measure. 

So if angle at X is a central angle over arc GH, then x equals arc GH's measure. But earlier, from the inscribed angle at A, arc GH is 220°, so x would be 220°, which is not an option. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that angle GAH is subtending arc GH. Wait, maybe angle GAH is subtending a different arc. 

Wait, angle GAH is formed at point A, with segments AG and AH. So the vertex is at A, and the sides are AG and AH. Therefore, this angle subtends the arc from G to H that does not contain A. Wait, but depending on where A is located on the circle, the arc could be minor or major. 

Since all points are on the circle, and A is one of them. If the arc GH not containing A is the minor arc, then the measure would be 2*angle GAH. Wait, but angle GAH is 110°, so the arc would be 220°, which would be the major arc. 

But then the central angle over arc GH (the major arc) would be 220°, hence x=220. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at X is not over the major arc but the minor arc. But how can that be? If the central angle is over the minor arc, then the measure would be the same as the minor arc. But if the inscribed angle is over the major arc, then it would be half of the major arc. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

An inscribed angle subtends an arc that is opposite to the angle. So, for angle GAH, the arc that it subtends is the arc GH that does not pass through A. Depending on where A is, this could be the minor or major arc. If the inscribed angle is 110°, then the measure of the arc it subtends is 220°, which would be the major arc GH. Therefore, the central angle over the same arc GH (major arc) would be 220°, which is x. Again, same conclusion. 

But since the answer choices don't include 220°, this suggests that perhaps the problem involves another angle relationship. Let me check the other given angle: angle at G, between K and H, which is 97°. As discussed earlier, this angle is an inscribed angle subtending arc KH. So, arc KH = 2*97° = 194°. Now, if we can find other arcs, maybe we can find arc GH. 

Assuming that all points G, H, J, K, A, X lie on the circle. Are there any other relationships? For example, points G, K, J are connected by lines. Maybe triangle GJK or something else? Or perhaps arcs related to those points?

Alternatively, maybe the sum of arcs around the circle. If we can express arc GH in terms of other arcs. For instance, if we assume that arc GH is part of the circle, and we know other arcs like arc KH, maybe we can find relations. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Another possibility: maybe angle at G, between K and H (which is 97°) relates to other arcs. Let me think about triangle GKH. In triangle GKH, the angles at G, K, and H. Wait, but we only know the angle at G. If we knew other angles, we could find more info. But we don't have that.

Alternatively, since points G, K, J are connected, and J is also on the circle. Maybe there's an inscribed angle involving J. But I don't have info about angles at J. 

Wait, maybe there's another inscribed angle. For example, angle at X is a central angle, but perhaps there's another inscribed angle related to that. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the fact that the sum of all arcs in a circle is 360°. If we can find other arcs, we can calculate arc GH. 

From earlier, we found that arc KH = 194° (from angle at G being 97°, which is half the arc KH). Now, if we can find arc KG or arc KH... Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the arc GH plus arc KH equals something. Not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the points are arranged such that G, K, H are consecutive points on the circle. If that's the case, then arc GK + arc KH = arc GH. But without knowing the order, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since points G, H, J, K are connected by lines, maybe they form a quadrilateral? Like G, H, J, K? Not sure. 

This seems stuck. Let me go back to the original problem statement. The answer choices include 123, which is close to 110+13, but not sure. Wait, if the measure of angle at X (x) is double the inscribed angle, but that gave us 220, which is not an option. However, the problem mentions that there is a central angle and an inscribed angle over the same arc. Perhaps there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not over arc GH, but over arc GXH or something else. Wait, the predicate says IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)), so it's definitely over arc GH. 

Wait, maybe the central angle is not over arc GH but over another arc, like GXH? No, the arc is specified as GH. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, but assuming it's correctly stated, I need to proceed. 

Wait, another idea: maybe the angle at X is not a central angle, but the problem says it is. But according to the predicate, it is. So, perhaps the measure of the central angle is not the same as the arc measure? No, that's not true. The central angle's measure equals the arc measure. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc GH is not the whole arc but a portion of it. Wait, but how? 

Wait, let's think differently. The problem says that the measure of angle at A is 110°, and it's an inscribed angle over arc GH. So the arc GH is 220°, as before. Then, the central angle over arc GH would be 220°, which would be x. But since 220 is not an option, maybe the actual arc is the other arc, i.e., the minor arc GH. Wait, but how? If the inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc it subtends must be 220°, which is the major arc. But if the arc GH is the minor arc, then the inscribed angle would be half of that, so the minor arc GH would be 220°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the problem, or my understanding is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at A is not subtending arc GH but another arc. Wait, angle at A is formed by GA and HA. So, the arc it subtends is the arc from G to H that does not contain A. So, if the arc GH not containing A is the minor arc, then the measure would be 2*angle GAH. But if angle GAH is 110°, then the arc would be 220°, which is major. Hence, the central angle over arc GH (major arc) is 220°, so x=220. 

But since 220 isn't an option, maybe the question refers to the other arc? Like, the arc GH that contains A? Wait, no. The inscribed angle subtends the arc that is opposite to the angle. So, if the angle is at A, then the arc is GH not containing A. 

Wait, but if the arc GH is the major arc (220°), then the central angle over that arc is 220°, which is x. But again, not in the options. 

Maybe the problem has a different setup. Let me check the other given angle: angle at G between K and H is 97°. This is an inscribed angle subtending arc KH. So arc KH is 2*97 = 194°. Now, suppose that arc KH is part of the circle. If we can relate arc KH to arc GH somehow. 

For example, if points G, K, H are placed such that arc GK + arc KH = arc GH. But without knowing the order, it's hard to tell. Assume that the points are arranged in the order G, K, H around the circle. Then arc GH would be arc GK + arc KH. But if arc KH is 194°, and arc GK is something else, we still need more information. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the total circumference is 360°, and we know arc KH is 194°, then the remaining arcs add up to 360 - 194 = 166°. But without knowing more arcs, this might not help. 

Wait, but we also have arc GH as 220°, which would mean that arc GH is 220°, and arc KH is 194°. If these are overlapping arcs, how do they relate? 

Alternatively, maybe arc GH is 220°, and arc KH is 194°, implying that the arc from G to H passing through K is 194°, while the arc from G to H directly is 220°. But that seems conflicting. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me revisit the problem statement for any missed details. 

Ah! Wait, the problem says that Point(X) lies on the circle, and the angle at X is a central angle over arc GH. But if the central angle is over arc GH, then the measure of the central angle is equal to the arc measure. However, the measure of the inscribed angle over the same arc GH is half of that. So, if the inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc GH is 220°, making the central angle x=220°. 

But since that's not an option, perhaps the question meant that the central angle is over a different arc? For example, maybe the arc GXH? No, the predicate specifies Arc(G,H). 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not a central angle but a different kind of angle. But the predicate says it is a central angle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the arc measure. Let me verify: if an inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc it subtends is 220°, correct. So the central angle over that arc is 220°. 

But since 220° is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not directly derived from this, but from another relationship. Let me check the other given angle. 

The angle at G between K and H is 97°, which is an inscribed angle subtending arc KH. So arc KH is 194°, as before. Now, if we consider that points G, K, H are on the circle, and arc KH is 194°, then what about arc GH? If arc GH is 220°, and arc KH is 194°, then depending on the arrangement, there might be overlap. 

But how can we connect these? If the points are arranged in the order G, K, H around the circle, then arc GH would consist of arc GK + arc KH. But we don't know arc GK. 

Alternatively, if the arc GH is 220°, and arc KH is 194°, then arc GK would be arc GH minus arc KH = 220 - 194 = 26°. 

But without knowing where point J is, this might not help. 

Wait, there's also point J on the circle, connected to G and K. So line GK connects G and K, and line GJ connects G and J. Maybe there's an inscribed angle involving J. 

But without any given angles related to J, I can't proceed further. 

Perhaps the answer is supposed to be 110°, which is the measure of the inscribed angle, but that's not the case. Or maybe there's a calculation error in the problem setup. 

Wait, the problem states that Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))). Oh! Wait, this is a crucial piece of information. The problem says that Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))), which is given as 110°. So x = 2 * 110 = 220. But the answer choices don't include 220. This suggests that there's an error in the problem or in my interpretation. 

But the answer choices are A.97, B.99, C.110, D.123. None of these are 220. So this indicates that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement. 

Wait, the problem says: Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))). So x is twice the measure of angle GAH, which is 110°, giving x = 220. But this contradicts the answer choices. However, the problem might have intended that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle, but in this case, the central angle is over a different arc. 

Wait, but according to the problem, the angle at X is a central angle over arc GH, and the inscribed angle at A is over the same arc. So x should be twice the inscribed angle. But the problem says that x = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)), which would be 220, but since that's not an option, there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not over arc GH, but over a different arc. Let me read the predicate again: IsCentralAngle(Angle(G,X,H), Arc(G,H)). So it's definitely over arc GH. 

Wait, perhaps the measure of the central angle is not equal to the arc measure, but something else. No, that's not possible. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. 

This is very confusing. Given that the answer choices don't include 220°, but the problem explicitly states that x = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)), which is 220°, but that's not an option, there must be a mistake. However, since the user provided the answer choices, and the problem might have a typo or I made a mistake. 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not a central angle, but the problem says it is. Alternatively, perhaps the measure of the central angle is supplementary to the arc? No, that's not the case. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at X is not the central angle, but the problem says it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc is not GH but GXH? No, the predicate says Arc(G,H). 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumptions. 

Wait, the problem says: Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))). So regardless of the geometric relationships, x is defined as twice the measure of angle GAH, which is 110°, so x=220. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem intended to ask for something else. 

Wait, but the answer choices are A-D, and one of them must be correct. Maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem. For example, if the central angle is over arc GH, but the inscribed angle is over a different arc. 

Wait, let me think: if the central angle is over arc GH, and the inscribed angle is over arc GK, then x would be twice the measure of the inscribed angle. But how would I know? 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at X is not over arc GH, but over arc GXH, which is another arc. But the predicate says Arc(G,H). 

I'm really stuck here. Given the answer choices, and if I had to choose, perhaps the correct answer is D. 123, but why? 

Wait, maybe the central angle is not over arc GH but over arc GXH, and the inscribed angle is over arc GH. Let me try that. 

Suppose the central angle at X is over arc GXH, and the inscribed angle at A is over arc GH. Then, the measure of the central angle would be equal to the arc GXH, and the inscribed angle would be half of arc GH. But without knowing the relation between arc GXH and arc GH, this is unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involved. For example, if points G, A, X are connected, forming a triangle. But without knowing angles or sides, it's difficult. 

Wait, the problem says that PointLiesOnCircle(Point(G), Circle(L)), and similarly for H, J, K, A, X. So all these points are on the circle. 

Maybe the angle at X is a central angle, and the angle at A is an inscribed angle, but they're not over the same arc. For example, the central angle at X is over arc GH, and the inscribed angle at A is over arc GK. But then the relationship wouldn't hold. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the central angle is over arc GK, and the inscribed angle is over arc GH. But without knowing, it's guesswork. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the problem explicitly states x = 2 * 110, which is 220, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D. 123, which is 110 + 13, but I don't know why. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at X is not the central angle but something else, and there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, the problem says that Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))). So even if the geometric relationships suggest otherwise, the problem defines x as twice the measure of angle GAH, which is 110°, giving x=220. But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option is D. 123. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a calculation error in the problem, and the correct answer is 2*97=194, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, but the problem states that Equals(x, Mul(2, MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)))), so x is explicitly defined as 2*110=220. Since this isn't an option, but the options are given, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. However, since I have to choose from the options, maybe the intended answer is D. 123, but I can't justify it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of angle GAH is not 110°, but something else. Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,H)), 110). So it is 110°. 

At this point, I think there's a mistake in the problem, but since I must choose from the options, and the only plausible way to get an answer from the given choices is to consider that the central angle is not over arc GH but over another arc. 

Wait, let me think: the angle at X is a central angle, and the angle at A is an inscribed angle. If the central angle is over arc GXH, and the inscribed angle is over arc GH, then the central angle would be twice the inscribed angle. But without knowing the arc GXH, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if the arc GXH is the same as arc GH, then x=220. 

Alternatively, if the arc is the minor arc GH, then the central angle would be 2*inscribed angle. Wait, but if the inscribed angle is over the major arc, then the central angle would be the same as the major arc. But if the inscribed angle is over the minor arc, then the central angle would be twice the inscribed angle. 

Wait, if the inscribed angle is over the minor arc GH, then its measure is half the arc. But if the arc is minor, then the inscribed angle would be half of it. So, if the inscribed angle is 110°, then the arc is 220°, which is major. So, this brings us back to the same issue. 

Given that I cannot resolve this discrepancy, and the problem explicitly states x=2*110=220, but it's not an option, I'll have to conclude that there's an error. However, since I must choose from the given options, perhaps the correct answer is D. 123, which is closest to 110 + 13, but this is pure speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem, and the intended answer is D. 123, which is 110 + 13, but I can't justify it. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the only logical conclusion based on the given information, even though it doesn't match the options. But since the problem says x = 2 * 110, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is D. 123. But this is uncertain. 

Wait, but if the measure of the central angle is not over the arc GH but over arc GX, then... No, the predicate says Arc(G,H). 

Finally, I'll assume that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to choose, and the only possible way is to take x=2*110=220, but since it's not an option, I'm forced to pick the closest one, which is D. 123. But this is just a shot in the dark. 

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of the inscribed angle is 110°, and the central angle is twice that, but the arc is 220°, and the angle at X is the supplement of that, giving 160°, which is not an option. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the information, the only consistent answer is x=220, but since it's not an option, there must be a mistake. However, since I must select from the choices, I'll go with D. 123, as a last resort.
