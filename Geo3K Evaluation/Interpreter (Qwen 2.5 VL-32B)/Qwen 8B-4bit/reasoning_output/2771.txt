<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the value of x based on the given predicates. Let me start by parsing all the information provided.

First, there's a quadrilateral ABCD. Points A, B, C, D are defined, and E is another point. The lines mentioned are AB, BC, CD, DA, forming the quadrilateral. Then there's line AE and DE. Also, angles at A and E are given as right angles. Plus, lines AB and DE are parallel. There are also equations involving the lengths of CD, AD, and AE in terms of x.

Let me list out all the given info again to make sure I don't miss anything:

- Quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D.
- Point E exists.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA form the quadrilateral.
- Lines AE and DE are present.
- Angle at DAB is a right angle (Angle(D,A,B)).
- Angle at DEA is a right angle (Angle(D,E,B)).
- AB is parallel to DE.
- Length of CD is 6x + 4.
- Length of AD is 5x + 10.
- Length of AE is 10x - 2.

Wait, the angles mentioned: Angle(D,A,B) would be the angle at point A between points D and B? Wait, angle notation usually is vertex in the middle. So Angle(D,A,B) means the angle at point A between points D and B. Similarly, Angle(D,E,B) is the angle at point E between D and B. Both these angles are right angles.

Also, since AB is parallel to DE, and there are right angles involved, maybe some triangles here could be similar or something?

But first, let me think about the structure. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB parallel to DE, but how do they relate? Maybe considering coordinates?

Alternatively, since there are right angles at A and E, perhaps triangles involved here have right angles, so Pythagoras could come into play.

Let me consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to points to model this. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since angle DAB is a right angle, so AB and AD are perpendicular. Let me assume AB is along the x-axis and AD is along the y-axis.

So, point A is (0,0). Let me define AB as horizontal. Let me denote AB length as some variable. But wait, the length of AD is given as 5x + 10. So AD is vertical. Let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me set:

- Point A: (0, 0)
- Since AD is vertical (because angle at A is right), then point D would be (0, AD_length). So D is (0, 5x + 10).

Then AB is horizontal. Let me call the length AB as 'a', but since AB is part of the quadrilateral, but we don't know its length yet. However, since AB is parallel to DE, and there's a point E connected to D and A.

Wait, point E is connected via lines AE and DE. Also, angle at E (Angle(D,E,B)) is a right angle. Hmm.

Let me try to find coordinates for other points. Let me proceed step by step.

Since AB is parallel to DE. Let me note that AB is horizontal (from earlier assumption). Therefore, DE should also be horizontal. Because if AB is horizontal, then DE must be horizontal too, since they're parallel.

Now, point D is at (0, 5x + 10). Let me find coordinates for point E such that DE is horizontal. Since DE is horizontal, then E has the same y-coordinate as D. So if D is at (0, y), then E is somewhere along the horizontal line y = y_D.

But also, point E is connected to A via line AE. So AE connects A(0,0) to E(some point). And since DE is horizontal, E lies horizontally aligned with D. Let me think.

Let me suppose coordinates for E. Let me denote E as (e_x, e_y). Since DE is horizontal, e_y = y_D = 5x + 10. Therefore, E is (e_x, 5x + 10). 

But also, line AE connects A(0,0) to E(e_x, 5x + 10). The slope of AE would be (5x+10)/e_x. 

Additionally, there's a right angle at E: angle DEA is a right angle. That is, angle at E between points D, E, B. So, vectors ED and EB should be perpendicular. 

Wait, angle at E between D and B. So, the lines ED and EB form a right angle. So vectors ED and EB are perpendicular. 

So vector ED goes from E to D: D - E = (0 - e_x, (5x + 10) - (5x + 10)) = (-e_x, 0). Vector EB goes from E to B: B - E = (B_x - e_x, B_y - (5x + 10)). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular.

But I need coordinates for B. Let me think. Since AB is horizontal, starting from A(0,0), and assuming AB has length 'a', then point B would be at (a, 0). But I don't know the value of 'a' yet. However, there's a line BC connecting to C, and CD connects back to D. But maybe I can express things in terms of variables.

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, but it's not specified whether it's a parallelogram or trapezoid. However, AB is parallel to DE, but not necessarily to CD or anything else.

But perhaps focusing on the right angles and the parallel lines. Let me see.

We have two right angles: at A (between DAB) and at E (between DEA). Also, AB || DE. So maybe triangle DEA is a right triangle?

Wait, angle at E is right, so triangle DEA is a right triangle with right angle at E. So in triangle DEA, DE is one leg, EA is another leg, and DA is hypotenuse. Wait, but DA is already given as 5x + 10. Let me check that.

In triangle DEA, right-angled at E, so by Pythagoras:

DE² + EA² = DA².

Yes! Because DE and EA are legs, DA is hypotenuse. So substituting the expressions:

DE is the length of DE. Let me compute DE. From earlier, D is at (0, 5x + 10), E is at (e_x, 5x + 10), so DE length is |0 - e_x| = |e_x|. So DE = |e_x|. Assuming e_x positive, since AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,0), and E is connected to A and D, perhaps e_x is positive? Not sure, but magnitude is absolute.

EA is the length from E to A, which is sqrt((e_x)^2 + (5x + 10)^2). Wait, because E is at (e_x, 5x + 10), and A is at (0,0). So distance EA is sqrt[(e_x - 0)^2 + (5x + 10 - 0)^2] = sqrt(e_x² + (5x + 10)^2).

DA is the length from D to A, which is 5x + 10 (since D is at (0, 5x + 10) and A is at (0,0), so vertical distance is 5x + 10).

Therefore, applying Pythagoras:

DE² + EA² = DA²

Which becomes:

(e_x)^2 + [sqrt(e_x² + (5x + 10)^2)]^2 = (5x + 10)^2

Wait, simplifying left side:

(e_x)^2 + e_x² + (5x + 10)^2 = (5x + 10)^2 ?

Wait that would mean:

Left side: e_x² + e_x² + (5x + 10)^2 = 2e_x² + (5x + 10)^2

Set equal to (5x + 10)^2:

2e_x² + (5x + 10)^2 = (5x + 10)^2 → 2e_x² = 0 → e_x = 0. Which implies E is at (0, 5x + 10), which is point D. But that can't be, since E is a distinct point. Contradiction. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, my mistake was in identifying the sides of the triangle. In triangle DEA, right-angled at E, so the hypotenuse should be DA, yes. But DE and EA are the legs. But according to Pythagoras, DE² + EA² = DA². But when I computed DE as |e_x|, and EA as sqrt(e_x² + (5x+10)^2), then DE² + EA² equals (e_x)^2 + [e_x² + (5x+10)^2] = 2e_x² + (5x+10)^2. Setting equal to DA² which is (5x+10)^2 gives 2e_x²=0 → e_x=0. Which suggests contradiction. Hence, my error must be in assuming which sides are the legs.

Wait, maybe the right angle is at E, so the hypotenuse is DA? Or maybe not. Let me re-examine the angle. Angle at E is between D-E-B. So, the angle between ED and EB is right. So, the triangle here is triangle DEB, right-angled at E. Wait, maybe I confused the triangle. So, points D, E, B. Right angle at E. So triangle DEB is right-angled at E. Thus, DE and BE are the legs, and DB is the hypotenuse.

Oh! My previous mistake was thinking of triangle DEA, but actually it's triangle DEB. So the right angle is at E between D-E-B. So the triangle is DEB, right-angled at E. Therefore, DE and EB are legs, DB is hypotenuse.

Thus, applying Pythagoras:

DE² + EB² = DB²

So I need to find DE, EB, and DB.

But I need expressions for those. Let me redo the analysis with this correction.

First, DE is the length from D to E. As before, D is at (0, 5x + 10), E is at (e_x, 5x + 10), so DE is |e_x - 0| = |e_x|. Assuming e_x positive, so DE = e_x.

EB is the length from E to B. Point B is at (a, 0) where a is the length AB. So coordinates of B are (a, 0). So vector from E to B is (a - e_x, 0 - (5x + 10)) = (a - e_x, -(5x + 10)). So length EB squared is (a - e_x)^2 + (5x + 10)^2.

DB is the length from D to B. Coordinates of D are (0, 5x + 10), coordinates of B are (a, 0). So DB squared is (a - 0)^2 + (0 - (5x + 10))^2 = a² + (5x + 10)^2.

So putting into Pythagoras:

DE² + EB² = DB² → (e_x)^2 + [(a - e_x)^2 + (5x + 10)^2] = a² + (5x + 10)^2.

Simplify left side: e_x² + (a - e_x)^2 + (5x + 10)^2.

Right side: a² + (5x + 10)^2.

Subtracting right side from left:

[e_x² + (a - e_x)^2 + (5x + 10)^2] - [a² + (5x + 10)^2] = e_x² + (a - e_x)^2 - a² = 0.

Expand (a - e_x)^2 = a² - 2ae_x + e_x².

So substitute:

e_x² + a² - 2ae_x + e_x² - a² = 2e_x² - 2ae_x = 0 → 2e_x(e_x - a) = 0.

Therefore, either e_x = 0 or e_x = a.

Case 1: e_x = 0. Then E is at (0, 5x + 10), which is same as point D. But E is a separate point, so invalid. Hence, case 2: e_x = a. So E is at (a, 5x + 10).

So coordinates of E are (a, 5x + 10). Now, since E is connected to A via line AE. Let me find the length of AE. Coordinates of A are (0,0), E are (a, 5x + 10). So AE length is sqrt[(a)^2 + (5x + 10)^2]. According to the given, AE = 10x - 2. Therefore:

sqrt[a² + (5x + 10)^2] = 10x - 2.

Square both sides:

a² + (5x + 10)^2 = (10x - 2)^2.

Expanding:

a² + 25x² + 100x + 100 = 100x² - 40x + 4.

Rearranging:

a² = 100x² - 40x + 4 - 25x² - 100x - 100

Combine like terms:

a² = (100x² -25x²) + (-40x - 100x) + (4 - 100)

a² = 75x² - 140x -96.

Hmm. So that's equation one.

Now, what else do we know? We also have the length of CD, which is 6x +4. Let me recall that ABCD is a quadrilateral. Points C and D are connected by CD. So need to find coordinates of C to find CD length. How?

Well, ABCD is a quadrilateral. Let me think. We have points A(0,0), B(a,0), C(?), D(0, 5x + 10). Need to find coordinates of C. Since BC is a line from B(a,0) to C, and CD is from C to D(0, 5x + 10). But without more info, it's hard to find coordinates of C directly. However, perhaps there's another relation.

Wait, but there's another given: the length of CD is 6x +4. So once I have coordinates for C, I can compute CD's length. But how to find coordinates of C?

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB || DE. Wait, AB is horizontal (from A(0,0) to B(a,0)), and DE is horizontal (from D(0, 5x +10) to E(a, 5x +10)), so DE is indeed horizontal. So AB and DE are both horizontal, hence parallel, which satisfies the condition.

But how does that help us? Well, maybe the quadrilateral ABCD has AB and CD as two sides, but unless it's a trapezoid, but we don't know. Alternatively, maybe there's something about the slopes?

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, maybe we can find relations between the sides. For example, BC connects B(a,0) to C, and CD connects C to D(0, 5x +10). But without knowing coordinates of C, it's tricky. Unless there's another condition.

Wait, but perhaps there's a relationship between AB and CD? Not sure. Wait, but there's also the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral, but unless it's a parallelogram or something else, not enough info.

Wait, but maybe since AB is parallel to DE, and DE is horizontal, then maybe there's some proportionality or similarity?

Alternatively, maybe look at triangle ABC or something else. Wait, but I'm stuck here. Let me think again.

We have another equation involving CD's length. CD is 6x +4. So, if I can express CD in terms of coordinates, then equate it to 6x +4.

To find coordinates of C, since BC connects B(a,0) to C, and CD connects C to D(0, 5x +10). But how to find coordinates of C? Without more info, perhaps we need another relation.

Wait, but maybe the quadrilateral is closed. So from A to B to C to D to A. So the position of C depends on the shape of the quadrilateral. However, without knowing angles or other sides, this seems difficult. Is there another way?

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB and CD connected. Wait, but maybe there's another right angle or something?

Alternatively, maybe the fact that angle at A is right angle. Wait, angle DAB is right angle, so AB is horizontal and AD is vertical. So ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB horizontal, AD vertical, and BC and CD completing the shape.

But without more info on BC or CD's direction, it's still unclear. However, we have CD's length as 6x +4. Let me think about coordinates of C.

Assuming that the quadrilateral is convex, but even then, coordinates of C depend on the shape. However, perhaps there's a way to express CD in terms of coordinates of C.

Coordinates of D: (0, 5x + 10). Coordinates of C: Let me assume that point C is somewhere such that BC connects to C and CD connects to D. But without more constraints, it's challenging. Wait, but maybe there's a relation through the line BC and CD?

Alternatively, since we have AB parallel to DE, and AB is horizontal, DE is horizontal, and E is at (a, 5x +10). Perhaps there's a connection between BC and DE?

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Maybe there are similar triangles or something.

Wait, going back to the earlier equation involving a². We had a² = 75x² -140x -96. But we need another equation to solve for x. Where can we get another equation?

CD's length is 6x +4. Let me find coordinates of C. Suppose we can find coordinates of C in terms of variables, then compute CD length.

But how?

Let me think about the quadrilateral ABCD. It's made up of points A(0,0), B(a,0), C(?, ?), D(0, 5x +10). To find coordinates of C, perhaps we need to use the fact that BC is connected to C and CD is connected to D. But without knowing the slope or something else, maybe there's another way.

Wait, but maybe the line BC is connected to line CD. So from B(a,0) to C, then to D(0, 5x +10). So the coordinates of C lie somewhere along the line BD? No, not necessarily. Unless it's a specific type of quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between BC and AD? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property due to the right angles and parallel lines. For instance, since AB || DE and there's a right angle at A, maybe some translation or reflection?

Alternatively, think about triangle ABD. Wait, AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (a,0), AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0, 5x +10). So BD is diagonal from B(a,0) to D(0, 5x +10). The length of BD is sqrt(a² + (5x +10)^2), which we saw earlier.

But how does this help? Maybe not directly.

Wait, but earlier we had an expression for a² in terms of x: a² = 75x² -140x -96. So if we can find another equation involving a and x, we can solve for x.

Where can we get another equation? The length of CD is 6x +4. Let me think about CD. CD connects point C to D(0, 5x +10). If I can express coordinates of C in terms of a and x, then compute CD length.

But how to find coordinates of C?

Perhaps using the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral, so the order is A-B-C-D-A. So, moving from B(a,0) to C, then to D(0, 5x +10). But without knowing the direction or slope of BC, it's hard to say. However, maybe there's a relation between BC and AD?

Alternatively, since AB || DE, and DE is horizontal, maybe there's a relation between BC and something else?

Alternatively, maybe consider triangle BCD? But without knowing more about it...

Wait, here's an idea: Since AB is parallel to DE, and AB is horizontal, DE is horizontal. Also, since E is at (a, 5x +10), which is same y-coordinate as D. So DE is horizontal, from D(0, 5x +10) to E(a, 5x +10). 

Now, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, and we have coordinates for A, B, D. Maybe point C can be found by extending some lines?

Alternatively, think of ABCD as having AB and CD as two opposite sides. But without being a parallelogram, we can't assume they are equal or parallel. 

Wait, but if AB is parallel to DE, but DE isn't necessarily parallel to CD. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that CD is connected to D and C, and BC connects to B and C. If I can find coordinates for C in terms of a and x, then compute CD.

But how? Maybe assume that point C lies somewhere along the line connecting B to D? No, not necessarily. 

Alternatively, think about the slope of BC. If I could find the slope, but I don't have enough info.

Wait, but there's another right angle at A, which is already used. Are there any other right angles or conditions?

No, the only right angles are at A and E. So perhaps there's no other right angles. 

Hmm. This seems stuck. Let me think differently. What if I consider that the length of CD is 6x +4, and CD connects C to D(0, 5x +10). If I can express CD in terms of a and x, then I can write another equation.

But without knowing C's coordinates, it's impossible. So maybe there's another relation involving point C?

Wait, but what about the line BC? It connects B(a,0) to C. If I can find coordinates of C, then CD can be calculated. But how?

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between BC and AE? Or other lines?

Alternatively, maybe the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral implies certain properties? Like, the sum of the vectors AB + BC + CD + DA = 0? But since it's a closed polygon.

Let me try that. Vector AB is (a, 0) - (0,0) = (a, 0). Vector BC is (C_x - a, C_y - 0). Vector CD is (0 - C_x, 5x + 10 - C_y). Vector DA is (0 - 0, 5x + 10 - 0) = (0, 5x +10). Summing them:

AB + BC + CD + DA = (a + (C_x - a) + (-C_x) + 0, 0 + (C_y) + (5x +10 - C_y) + (5x +10)) 

Simplifying x-component: a + C_x -a - C_x + 0 = 0.

y-component: 0 + C_y + 5x +10 - C_y + 5x +10 = 10x + 20.

For the quadrilateral to close, this sum should be zero. But we get 10x + 20 = 0 → x = -2. Which is impossible since lengths are positive. So this suggests an error in reasoning.

Wait, why? Because the vector addition for a closed polygon should give zero. But here, it gives 10x + 20. So this suggests that our assumption about the coordinates may be missing something. Perhaps the way we assigned coordinates is incorrect?

Wait, the vector DA is from D to A, which is (0 - 0, 0 - (5x +10)) = (0, - (5x +10)). Earlier, I thought DA was from A to D, but in vector terms, DA is from D to A. So maybe I messed up the direction of vectors?

Let me re-calculate the vector sum properly.

Vector AB: from A to B: (a, 0) - (0, 0) = (a, 0).
Vector BC: from B to C: (C_x - a, C_y - 0) = (C_x - a, C_y).
Vector CD: from C to D: (0 - C_x, (5x +10) - C_y) = (-C_x, 5x +10 - C_y).
Vector DA: from D to A: (0 - 0, 0 - (5x +10)) = (0, -5x -10).

Summing all vectors:

AB + BC + CD + DA = (a + (C_x - a) + (-C_x) + 0, 0 + C_y + (5x +10 - C_y) + (-5x -10)).

Compute x-component: a + C_x - a - C_x + 0 = 0.

Y-component: 0 + C_y + 5x +10 - C_y -5x -10 = 0. 

Ah! So the total sum is (0, 0), which is correct. So my previous calculation was wrong because I incorrectly included DA as from A to D instead of D to A. So that resolves the issue. Hence, no new information here.

Back to square one. How to find CD length?

Maybe there's another way. Recall that we have the length of AE as 10x - 2, and earlier we had an equation involving a². Also, CD is 6x +4. But how to connect them?

Wait, what about triangle AED? Wait, no. Earlier, we had triangle DEB being right-angled at E, leading to e_x = a. So E is at (a, 5x +10). Also, AE has length sqrt(a² + (5x +10)^2) = 10x -2. Squared, that gives a² + (5x +10)^2 = (10x -2)^2. Which led to a² = 75x² -140x -96.

Now, if we can find another equation involving a and x, we can solve for x.

What else do we know? CD is 6x +4. Let me think. CD is from point C to D(0, 5x +10). If I can express coordinates of C in terms of a and x, then compute CD length.

But how? Let me think about the line BC. Since we have point B(a,0) and point C somewhere, and CD connects to D(0, 5x +10). Maybe there's a relation between BC and CD?

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, and we know three of its vertices (A, B, D), but not C. But maybe there's a way to express C in terms of other variables?

Alternatively, think about the slope of CD. If I can find the slope of CD, but I don't know.

Wait, but perhaps there's another right angle or something? No, only at A and E.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between BC and AD? Since AB is parallel to DE, and AB is horizontal, DE is horizontal. Maybe BC is related to something?

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Since E is connected to D and A, and we've placed E at (a, 5x +10), which is same y-coordinate as D. Maybe there's a rectangle or something involving E?

Alternatively, since AE has length 10x -2, and we have an expression for a² in terms of x, maybe combine that with CD's length?

But CD is 6x +4. How to connect CD with a?

Wait, maybe CD is connected to point C, which is connected to B(a,0) and D(0, 5x +10). So if I can find coordinates of C, then CD can be expressed.

But how? Let me consider that CD is a side of the quadrilateral. If I assume that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid with AB || CD? But the problem doesn't state that. However, since AB || DE, but DE is not necessarily parallel to CD.

Alternatively, think of the coordinates of C as lying somewhere on the line connecting B and D? No, unless specified.

Wait, here's an idea: Since AB || DE, and AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,0), DE is from D(0,5x+10) to E(a,5x+10). So DE is a translation of AB upwards by (5x+10) units. Maybe there's some symmetry or transformation?

Alternatively, think of translating vector AB to DE. Since AB is vector (a,0), and DE is vector (a,0) as well (from D(0, y) to E(a, y)). So yes, DE is a translation of AB. So if we translate AB up by (5x +10) units, we get DE.

But how does this help with finding CD?

Maybe not directly. But perhaps there's a relation between BC and something else.

Wait, since AB is translated to DE, and the quadrilateral ABCD is connected, maybe there's a relationship between BC and EC? Or something else?

Alternatively, since E is connected to D and A, and we have coordinates for E(a, 5x +10), and D(0, 5x +10), and A(0,0), perhaps there's a way to find C through some other relation.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think again about the equation we have for a² = 75x² -140x -96. Can I find another equation involving a and x?

If I can find CD in terms of a and x, then set it equal to 6x +4.

But how to find CD? Let me think: CD is from C to D(0, 5x +10). If I can find coordinates of C, then compute CD.

But how to find coordinates of C? Let me think: The line BC connects B(a,0) to C, and line CD connects C to D(0, 5x +10). So point C lies somewhere such that it connects B to C to D. But without more info, like slope or something, I cannot determine C's coordinates.

Wait, but maybe there's another right angle or something? Or maybe the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral allows for some relation?

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between BC and AD? Not sure.

Alternatively, since we have the length of CD as 6x +4, maybe express CD in terms of a and x by using coordinates of C.

But without knowing where C is, this seems impossible. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, going back to the beginning, all given predicates are:

- Quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D.
- Point E exists.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA, AE, DE.
- Angles at A and E are right angles.
- AB || DE.
- Lengths of CD, AD, AE in terms of x.

Wait, we have AD length as 5x +10, which we've already used. CD is 6x +4, AE is 10x -2.

Is there a way to relate CD to other parts?

Wait, CD is connected to D and C. If I can find coordinates of C in terms of a and x, then CD can be expressed.

But how? Let me think: Assume that the line BC has some relation to the other lines. For example, since AB || DE, and DE is horizontal, maybe BC has a certain slope?

Alternatively, think about the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral, so the slopes of AB and CD might have some relation? Not necessarily.

Alternatively, since AB is horizontal, and AD is vertical, maybe ABCD is a right trapezoid? If so, then CD would be slanting, but not sure.

Wait, if ABCD is a right trapezoid with right angles at A and D, then AD and AB would be perpendicular, and CD would be parallel to AB. But in this case, AB || DE, but not sure about CD.

But if ABCD were a right trapezoid with bases AB and CD, then CD would be parallel to AB, making it parallel to DE as well. But DE is parallel to AB, so CD would be parallel to DE, which would make CD parallel to AB and DE. But the problem doesn't specify that ABCD is a trapezoid, so this is just speculation.

However, if I assume that CD is parallel to AB (and thus to DE), then CD would be horizontal. So, since D is at (0, 5x +10), and CD is horizontal, then C would be at (c, 5x +10), where c is some x-coordinate. Then, CD length would be |c - 0| = |c|. So CD = |c| = 6x +4. Hence, c = ±(6x +4). But since AB is from (0,0) to (a,0), and CD is parallel to AB, then C would be at (c, 5x +10), and D is at (0, 5x +10). So CD is horizontal, from D(0, y) to C(c, y), so length is |c - 0| = |c| = 6x +4.

But then, what about point C? Since C is connected to B(a,0) and D(0, y). So the line BC connects B(a,0) to C(c, y), and CD connects C(c, y) to D(0, y).

So, coordinates of C are (c, 5x +10). Now, the length CD is |c| = 6x +4, so c = 6x +4 or -(6x +4). Assuming the figure is drawn in standard orientation, likely c is positive, so c = 6x +4.

Now, we can find coordinates of C as (6x +4, 5x +10). Then, since BC connects B(a,0) to C(6x +4, 5x +10). The slope of BC would be [5x +10 - 0]/[6x +4 - a] = (5x +10)/(6x +4 - a).

But without knowing the slope, how does this help? Unless there's another condition.

Wait, but we also know that the line BC connects to C, and CD connects to D. But without more info, maybe this is not helpful.

However, we can now calculate the length of BC, but we don't have info about it. But maybe there's a relation between BC and other parts?

Alternatively, since we have point C(6x +4, 5x +10), and we know that BC connects B(a,0) to C(6x +4, 5x +10), and CD is from C to D(0, 5x +10). So the length of CD is 6x +4, as given.

But how does this help us find a relation between a and x? Let me think. 

From earlier, we have a² = 75x² -140x -96. And also, since point C is (6x +4, 5x +10), and BC connects B(a,0) to C(6x +4, 5x +10). So the coordinates of C are determined in terms of x. But how does this relate to a?

Wait, but there's no direct relation unless there's another condition. However, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the line BC connects B to C, and CD connects C to D. But without more constraints, it's still unclear.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between BC and AD? For example, if ABCD is a parallelogram, but we don't know that. Or maybe some other condition.

Alternatively, since we have point C at (6x +4, 5x +10), and point D at (0, 5x +10), then CD is horizontal, as assumed. Now, what about the line BC? It goes from B(a,0) to C(6x +4, 5x +10). Could there be a relation between this line and something else?

Wait, but we also have point E at (a, 5x +10). So E is at (a, 5x +10), and C is at (6x +4, 5x +10). So both E and C are on the horizontal line y = 5x +10. So the x-coordinates of E and C are a and 6x +4 respectively. So the distance between E and C is |a - (6x +4)|.

But is there any relation between E and C? Not directly given. Unless there's a line EC or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a right angle at C? Not stated. 

Alternatively, think about triangle BCE or something? Not sure.

But let's think: since we have point C at (6x +4, 5x +10), and point B at (a, 0). So the line BC has slope m = [5x +10 - 0]/[6x +4 - a] = (5x +10)/(6x +4 - a). 

But without knowing this slope, it's not helpful. 

But perhaps there's another condition. Wait, we have AE's length as 10x -2, which gave us the equation a² + (5x +10)^2 = (10x -2)^2, leading to a² = 75x² -140x -96.

Now, if we can find a second equation involving a and x, we can solve for x. 

But how? Let me think: if CD is 6x +4, and we have point C at (6x +4, 5x +10), then what about BC's length? We don't have info about BC, but maybe it relates to something else?

Wait, but maybe the line BC is connected to something else? Or maybe there's a relation between BC and DE? Not sure.

Alternatively, since E is at (a, 5x +10), and C is at (6x +4, 5x +10), then the x-coordinate of C is 6x +4, and x-coordinate of E is a. So if there's a relation between a and 6x +4, like a = 6x +4, but why would that be?

Unless there's a reason to believe that E and C are the same point, but that would imply 6x +4 = a and 5x +10 = 5x +10, which is always true. But if a = 6x +4, then we can substitute into the equation for a².

Recall that a² = 75x² -140x -96.

If a = 6x +4, then a² = (6x +4)^2 = 36x² +48x +16.

Setting equal to 75x² -140x -96:

36x² +48x +16 = 75x² -140x -96

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 75x² -140x -96 -36x² -48x -16

Simplify:

75x² -36x² = 39x²

-140x -48x = -188x

-96 -16 = -112

So:

39x² -188x -112 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation for x.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [188 ± sqrt(188² - 4*39*(-112))]/(2*39)

Calculate discriminant:

188² = 35,344

4*39*112 = 4*39*112 = 4*4368 = 17,472

So discriminant is 35,344 + 17,472 = 52,816

sqrt(52,816) = 230 (since 230² = 52,900, which is slightly higher; wait let me calculate 230² = 52,900, so 230^2 = 52900, so 52816 is less than that. Let me check 230² = 52900, 229² = 52441. So between 229 and 230. Let me calculate 229.5² = (229 + 0.5)^2 = 229² + 229 + 0.25 = 52441 + 229 + 0.25 = 52670.25, still less than 52816. Next, 230 - let's see:

Let me compute sqrt(52816). Let me divide 52816 by 16: 52816 / 16 = 3301. So sqrt(52816) = 4*sqrt(3301). Not helpful. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant?

Wait, original equation: 39x² -188x -112 = 0. Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-188)^2 -4*39*(-112) = 35,344 + 4*39*112.

Let me recalculate 4*39*112:

First, 4*39 = 156. Then 156*112. Let's compute 156*100 = 15,600; 156*12 = 1,872. Total: 15,600 + 1,872 = 17,472. So D = 35,344 + 17,472 = 52,816.

Now, sqrt(52,816). Let me check 230^2 = 52,900, which is 84 more than 52,816. So sqrt(52,816) = 230 - ε. Let me try 229^2 = 52,441. 52,816 - 52,441 = 375. So between 229 and 230. Let me try 229 + x, where x is small. Let me see:

Let me try 229.5^2 = 229^2 + 2*229*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 52,441 + 229 + 0.25 = 52,670.25. Still lower than 52,816.

Next, 229 + 1.5 = 230.5: 230.5^2 = (230 + 0.5)^2 = 230² + 2*230*0.5 + 0.25 = 52,900 + 230 + 0.25 = 53,130.25. Too high.

So the sqrt is between 229.5 and 230. Let me try 229.8^2:

229.8^2 = (230 - 0.2)^2 = 230
