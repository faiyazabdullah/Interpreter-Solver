MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D on a circle E. The angle ABC is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of the minor arc AC, which is x. Also, there's a major arc ADC with measure y, and the sum of x and y is 360 degrees because they make up the whole circle. 

First, I remember that in circle geometry, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Here, angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. Wait, but point B is on the circle? Let me check the predicates again. Points A, B, C, D are all on circle E. So, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, angle at B, which is angle ABC, should be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. 

So according to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC. Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, so that would mean arc AC is twice that, which is 140 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions minor arc AC and major arc ADC. Since the total circumference is 360 degrees, if arc AC is 140 degrees, then the major arc ADC would be 360 - 140 = 220 degrees. However, the problem says that the sum of x (minor arc AC) and y (major arc ADC) is 360, which checks out here. 

But wait, the answer choices don't have 140. The options are A.90, B.100, C.110, D.120. Hmm. That suggests maybe my initial thought is wrong. Maybe I misapplied the theorem?

Wait, let me double-check. Is angle ABC indeed intercepting arc AC? Let me visualize. Points A, B, C, D are on the circle. Line AB and BC are drawn. So, point B is connected to A and C. The angle at B is formed by chords BA and BC. In that case, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite the angle, which would be arc AC that doesn't contain B. But since B is on the circle, depending on where B is located, the arc could be minor or major. 

Wait, but if angle ABC is an inscribed angle, it intercepts arc AC. But if B is on the circle, then the arc AC that is intercepted is the one that's opposite the angle. But if the angle is 70 degrees, then the arc AC should be 140 degrees. But why isn't 140 an option? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not intercepting arc AC directly. Maybe there's another consideration. For example, sometimes when there are other arcs involved, like the major arc. Wait, but the problem states that the minor arc AC is x and major arc ADC is y. So, the angle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. Depending on where B is placed, the intercepted arc could be different. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe angle ABC is not an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC, but instead intercepting some other arc. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. So, if B is on the circle, then angle ABC intercepts arc AC that does not pass through B. But if B is positioned such that moving along the circle from A to C passing through the side opposite to B, then that arc is the minor arc AC. 

But if the arc AC is minor, then the measure would be 140 degrees, making the major arc ADC equal to 220. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe the angle ABC intercepts the major arc ADC? No, that wouldn't make sense. Because the inscribed angle would intercept the arc that's opposite. If B is on the circle, then the intercepted arc would be the arc AC that doesn't include B. 

Wait, but if the arc AC is the minor arc, then the angle ABC would be half of that. But if the arc AC were the major arc, then the angle would be half of that. But since angle ABC is given as 70 degrees, which is less than 90, that suggests that the intercepted arc is the minor arc AC, because half of the major arc would be larger than 90. 

Wait, for instance, if the intercepted arc was the major arc ADC, then the angle would be half of that. Suppose y is the major arc ADC, then angle ABC would be half of y. But since the angle is 70 degrees, then y would be 140 degrees. Then the minor arc AC would be 360 - 140 = 220, which contradicts. So that can't be. 

Hmm, something's off here. Maybe the angle is not intercepting arc AC directly. Maybe there's another configuration. Let me consider the diagram. Points A, B, C, D are all on circle E. Arc AD C is mentioned as the major arc. So, starting at A, going through D to C. So, the major arc ADC implies that D is a point on the circle such that the arc from A to C via D is longer than the minor arc AC. 

Now, angle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. Let me imagine that B is somewhere on the circle. If the arc AC is the minor arc, then the angle at B would be half of that. But if the arc AC is the major arc, then the angle would be half of that. But since the angle is given as 70 degrees, which is relatively small, that suggests that the intercepted arc is the minor arc AC. Hence, the measure of arc AC is 140 degrees, which would make the major arc ADC equal to 220 degrees. However, none of the answer choices is 140. So, that suggests that my assumption is incorrect. 

Wait, but the problem says that the measure of angle ABC equals half of the measure of arc AC. According to the given predicate, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))). So, that's explicitly stated. Therefore, angle ABC is half of arc AC. Therefore, arc AC is 140 degrees. But again, the answer choices do not have 140. So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the arc AC referred to in the predicate is the major arc? Or is there confusion between minor and major arcs? Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says: "the degree measure of minor arc AC and major arc ADC are x and y respectively." So, x is minor arc AC, and y is major arc ADC. Therefore, the angle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. Now, if the intercepted arc is the minor arc AC, then angle ABC is half of x. But if the intercepted arc is the major arc ADC, then angle ABC would be half of y. 

But how do we know which arc is intercepted? The intercepted arc is determined by the position of point B. If B is on the same side of the chord AC as the center, then the intercepted arc would be the minor arc. Otherwise, it would be the major arc. 

However, without knowing the exact position of B, we need to deduce based on the given information. But the problem gives us that angle ABC is 70 degrees. If the intercepted arc is the minor arc AC (x), then x = 2*70=140. But since the answer choices don't have 140, maybe the intercepted arc is the major arc ADC (y)? But then angle ABC would be half of y, so y = 140, and x = 360 - y = 220. But then x would be 220, which is also not an option. 

This contradiction suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me go back to the predicates. One of the given predicates is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))). This seems to indicate that angle ABC is half of arc AC. Therefore, regardless of whether arc AC is minor or major, the measure of angle ABC is half of that arc. But in reality, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, which depends on which arc is intercepted. 

So, if the angle ABC intercepts arc AC, which is the minor arc, then x = 140. But since this is not an option, maybe the arc AC in the predicate refers to the major arc? Wait, but the problem defines x as minor arc AC and y as major arc ADC. So, the arc AC in the predicate could be either minor or major. 

Wait, but the predicate says MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)), which typically refers to the minor arc unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, since there's a major arc ADC mentioned, maybe the arc AC being referenced is the major arc. But that would conflict with standard notation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle ABC intercepts the major arc ADC. Wait, no, because the angle at B is formed by points A, B, C. So, the intercepted arc would be the arc AC that does not contain B. If B is located such that the arc AC not containing B is the major arc, then angle ABC would be half of that major arc. 

Let me think. Suppose that B is located on the circle such that when you look at arc AC, it's actually the major arc ADC. Then, the measure of angle ABC would be half of the major arc ADC. But the problem says that angle ABC is 70 degrees. So, then y (major arc ADC) would be 140 degrees. Then, x (minor arc AC) would be 360 - 140 = 220. Again, not matching the options. 

Wait, but this is confusing. Let me check the given predicates again. There's also Arc(A,D,C) which is the major arc ADC. And the measure of that is y. The measure of arc AC is x. So, the sum of x and y is 360. 

Given that, and the fact that angle ABC is half of arc AC (as per the predicate), then x = 2*70 = 140. But since 140 isn't an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, but maybe the angle ABC is not an inscribed angle? How is that possible? If B is on the circle, then angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Unless... unless the angle is not formed by two chords but by a tangent or something. But the predicates say Line(A,B) and Line(B,C), so those are straight lines, hence chords. 

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the type of angle. For example, if point B is outside the circle, then the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But the problem states that all points A, B, C, D are on circle E. So, B is on the circle. Therefore, angle ABC is an inscribed angle. 

So, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the intercepted arc AC. Which would be x. So x = 140. But since this isn't an option, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the answer choices again: A.90, B.100, C.110, D.120. None of these is 140. So, maybe the angle is half the measure of the major arc? 

Wait, suppose that the intercepted arc is the major arc ADC. Then, the angle ABC would be half of that. Let's assume that. Then, angle ABC = (1/2)*y => 70 = (1/2)y => y = 140. Then, since x + y = 360, x = 360 - 140 = 220. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the angle is supposed to be half the measure of the arc ADC? No, that doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the angle ABC intercepts arc ADC? But how? The angle at B is formed by AB and BC. The intercepted arc would be the arc from A to C not passing through B. If B is positioned such that the arc AC passing through D is the major arc, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc ADC. But then angle ABC would be half of that, leading to y = 140. But then x is 220, which still isn't an option. 

Is there another way? Let me think about the sum x + y = 360. If x is the minor arc AC, and y is the major arc ADC. Then, if angle ABC is half of y, then 70 = (1/2)y → y = 140. So, x = 220. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, if angle ABC intercepts the minor arc AC (x), then x = 140. Still not in options. 

Wait, but the answer choices are all smaller than 140. Perhaps the angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle? No, because a central angle would have its vertex at the center of the circle, but point B is on the circle, so it's an inscribed angle. 

Wait, maybe the given predicate is misleading? Let me read it again: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))). So, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC. Which would imply that arc AC is 140 degrees. But since that's not an option, perhaps there's an error in the problem or in my understanding. 

Wait, could there be a mix-up between radians and degrees? No, the question specifies degree measures. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc AC is not the entire arc but part of it? Or perhaps the angle is referring to the reflex angle? No, because reflex angles are greater than 180 degrees. 

Wait, another thought: maybe the arc AC is not the minor arc but the major arc, but the angle is half of the major arc. Let's see. If angle ABC is half the measure of the major arc AC, then the major arc AC would be 140 degrees. But that would mean the minor arc AC is 360 - 140 = 220, which is impossible because the minor arc should be the shorter one. So that can't be. 

I'm stuck. The given information leads to x = 140, which isn't an option. But the answer choices are A-D. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the angle's relationship to the arc. Let me recall the inscribed angle theorem again. 

Inscribed angle theorem: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is cut off by the sides of the angle and lies opposite the angle. So, if the angle is at point B, then the intercepted arc is AC that doesn't contain B. 

Now, if the arc AC not containing B is the minor arc, then x = 140. But since that's not an option, maybe the arc AC containing B is the major arc. Wait, but the major arc ADC includes D. So, if the intercepted arc is the major arc ADC, then the measure of angle ABC would be half of that. So, angle ABC = (1/2)y. Given angle ABC is 70, then y = 140. Thus, the major arc ADC is 140 degrees. Then, the minor arc AC would be 360 - 140 = 220, which is impossible because the minor arc should be the smaller one. So this can't be. 

Wait, but if the major arc ADC is 140, then the minor arc AC would be 220, which is larger than 180, contradicting the definition of minor arc. Hence, this scenario is invalid. 

Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the intercepted arc is the minor arc AC, giving x = 140 degrees. But since this isn't an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there's also PointLiesOnCircle for points A, B, C, D. All four points are on the circle. So, quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle E. But how does that affect the angle? 

Maybe triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle, and angle ABC is an inscribed angle. But again, this brings us back to the same issue. 

Wait, perhaps the arc AC mentioned in the predicate is the major arc? But the problem states that x is the minor arc AC and y is the major arc ADC. So, if the predicate refers to the major arc AC, then x would be the minor arc. But that seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc AC in the predicate is the major arc, and the problem's x is the minor arc. Let's suppose that. So, angle ABC = 70 degrees = (1/2)(major arc AC). So, major arc AC = 140. Then, minor arc AC = 360 - 140 = 220. But again, this is not possible because the minor arc should be the smaller one. 

This is very confusing. Since the answer choices don't include 140, but the calculation seems unavoidable, maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, let me think differently. Could the angle ABC be an external angle? For example, if B were outside the circle, then the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But the problem states that B is on the circle. 

Wait, but if B is on the circle, then angle ABC is an inscribed angle. But what if the arc AC is the major arc? No, that would require B to be positioned such that the intercepted arc is the major arc. 

Wait, let's imagine the circle with points A and C. The minor arc AC is x, and the major arc AC is y. If B is on the circle such that when you connect A to B to C, the angle at B intercepts the minor arc AC. Then x = 140. But since that's not an option, maybe the angle intercepts the major arc AC, which would be y. So, angle ABC = 70 = (1/2)y => y = 140. Then, since y is the major arc AC, the minor arc AC is x = 360 - 140 = 220. But again, this is not possible because the minor arc should be the smaller one. 

Wait, unless the arc AC is considered as the major arc, and the problem's x is the minor arc. But in that case, the major arc AC would be y, and minor arc AC is x. So, if angle ABC intercepts the major arc AC, then x = 360 - y. But angle ABC = (1/2)y. So, substituting, 70 = (1/2)y → y = 140. Then x = 360 - 140 = 220. But x is supposed to be the minor arc, which would be 220, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem setup, or perhaps I've misread the question. 

Wait, the problem says: "The degree measure of minor arc AC and major arc ADC are x and y respectively." So, the major arc is ADC, which is from A to C passing through D. So, the major arc ADC is y. The minor arc AC is x. 

So, the total circumference is x + y = 360. 

Also, angle ABC = 70 degrees = (1/2)x. So, x = 140. But since that's not an option, perhaps the angle ABC is half of the major arc ADC? 

If angle ABC = (1/2)y, then 70 = (1/2)y → y = 140. Then x = 360 - 140 = 220. But x is the minor arc, which would be 220, which is larger than 180, which contradicts the definition of minor arc. 

Thus, this scenario is impossible. 

But the problem must have a valid answer. Maybe the given predicate is incorrect? Let me re-read it. 

One of the given predicates is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))). This suggests that angle ABC is half of arc AC. But if arc AC is the minor arc, then x = 140. If the answer isn't among the choices, perhaps the intended answer is 140, and the options are wrong, or there's a mistake in the problem. 

But since the answer choices are given, and I must choose from them, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider alternative approaches. 

Wait, what if the arc AC is not the direct arc but involves other points? For example, if the arc AC is the arc that goes through D, making it the major arc ADC. But then, angle ABC would intercept that arc. But how? 

If B is positioned such that when you draw AB and CB, the angle at B intercepts the major arc ADC. But in that case, the measure of angle ABC would be half of the major arc ADC. So, angle ABC = (1/2)y => y = 140. Then x = 360 - y = 220. But again, x is supposed to be the minor arc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle ABC intercepts arc ADC, but that's not possible because the angle is formed by points A, B, C. 

Wait, another idea: maybe the arc AC is not the arc between A and C directly, but the arc that passes through D? No, because arc ADC is the major arc. 

At this point, I'm really confused. Given that the problem states that angle ABC is half of arc AC, leading to x = 140, but this is not an option, I suspect there may be a mistake in the problem. However, assuming that the answer must be among the choices, perhaps the intended answer is 140, but since it's not listed, maybe I need to reconsider. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle? No, because the vertex is on the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc AC is the arc subtended by angle ABC, but it's a different arc. Wait, in some cases, an inscribed angle can subtend two arcs, but the measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, another possibility: if the angle ABC is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, but point B is on the circle. No, that would not apply here. 

I think I'm stuck. Given that the calculation leads to x = 140, which isn't an option, but the closest possible answer in the choices is C.110 or D.120. Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle? If B were the center, then the angle would be a central angle. But B is on the circle. So, that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the arc AC is not the one directly between A and C, but the arc AC that goes through D, making it the major arc ADC. But then, the measure of the angle would be half of that. So, angle ABC = (1/2)y. Given angle is 70, then y = 140. Thus, x = 360 - 140 = 220. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if the angle is half the difference of the arcs? Like if B is outside the circle. Wait, but B is on the circle. 

Wait, what if the angle ABC is formed by two tangents? No, because AB and BC are lines connecting points on the circle, so they're chords, not tangents. 

I'm running out of ideas. Since the calculation consistently leads to x = 140, but it's not an option, perhaps there's an error in the problem. However, since I need to choose from the options, maybe the correct answer is 140, and the closest option is D.120. But that's just guessing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 70, which is half the measure of the arc, but the arc is the major arc. Wait, if the angle is half the measure of the major arc, then major arc is 140, so the minor arc is 220. But that's not possible. 

Wait, unless the angle is half the measure of the arc that's not intercepted. No, that doesn't make sense. 

Another thought: maybe the arc AC is the arc that is not the minor arc. For example, if the arc AC is the major arc, then the measure of angle ABC is half of that. So, angle ABC = 70 = (1/2)*major arc AC. Major arc AC = 140. Then, minor arc AC = 360 - 140 = 220. But this is not possible. 

Wait, but maybe the arc AC in the predicate is the major arc, and the problem's x is the minor arc. So, if the major arc AC is 140, then x = 220. But since x is supposed to be the minor arc, this is impossible. 

I think I have to conclude that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I must choose from the options, and the closest possible is C.110 or D.120. Wait, if I assumed that the angle is half of the major arc ADC, then y = 140, and x = 220. But 220 is not an option. 

Alternatively, if the angle is half of the minor arc AC, x = 140, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the actual measure is 140, and the answer choices are wrong. But I have to pick from the given options. 

Wait, let me check if there's a different interpretation. What if the arc AC is the arc ADC minus something? Or maybe the arc ADC is divided into parts? 

No, the problem states that the major arc ADC is y, and minor arc AC is x. 

Wait, another possibility: the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees, which is half the measure of the arc AC, but the arc AC is actually the arc ADC. Wait, but that would be the major arc. So, angle ABC = (1/2)y, where y is the major arc ADC. So, y = 140. Then, the minor arc AC is x = 360 - y = 220. But again, this is not possible. 

This is extremely frustrating. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a mistake in the problem, but since the answer must be chosen from the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.110. Let me see: if x is 110, then y = 250. Angle ABC would be half of x, so 55, but the given angle is 70. Doesn't match. 

If x is 100, then angle would be 50. No. If x is 120, angle is 60. Still not 70. 

Wait, maybe the angle is half the measure of the arc AC, but the arc AC is the arc that goes through D, making it the major arc. So, angle ABC = (1/2)*(major arc AC) = 70 → major arc AC = 140. Then, minor arc AC is 360 - 140 = 220. But this is not possible. 

Unless the arc AC is considered as the major arc, but the problem says x is the minor arc. 

At this point, I think the correct answer must be 140, even though it's not listed. But since the options are given, and I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is C.110. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle. If B were the center, then the angle ABC would be a central angle, and the measure would be equal to the arc AC. But B is on the circle, so that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if the arc AC is 140, and the answer choices are wrong, but I have to choose the closest. Since 140 is not present, but the closest is D.120. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the measure of the angle is 70 degrees, and the arc is x, and the sum x + y = 360, and the angle is half the arc. So, x = 140, y = 220. But since the answer choices don't include 140, perhaps there's a different relationship. 

Wait, what if the angle is 70, and it's half the measure of the arc ADC? So, 70 = (1/2)y → y = 140. Then x = 360 - 140 = 220. But again, this is not possible. 

I'm forced to conclude that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I must choose from the options, and none of them match, I'll guess that the correct answer is C.110, even though it doesn't align with the calculations. But this is uncertain. 

Wait, let me try one last thing. If the angle is 70, and it's half the measure of the arc AC, which is x, then x = 140. But perhaps the arc AC is the arc that goes through D, making it the major arc. So, if x is the minor arc AC, then the major arc ADC is y = 360 - x. But the angle is half of the arc AC, which is x. So, x = 140. 

But since x is the minor arc, and the major arc is y = 220. But this is not an option. 

I think I have to accept that the answer is not available in the choices, but since I must choose, perhaps the intended answer is C.110, assuming that there's a calculation error. Alternatively, maybe the angle is supplementary to the arc. 

Wait, if the angle is 70, and it's half the measure of the arc AC, then x = 140. But if the arc AC is actually the major arc, then x is 140, and the minor arc is 220. But since the problem asks for x, which is the minor arc, this is impossible. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the constraints, the only logical answer is 140, which is not listed. But since I must choose, I'll go with the closest option, which is D.120, even though it's not accurate. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the angle is not an inscribed angle, but the arc AC is a semicircle? No, because 70 is not 90. 

Alternatively, if the arc AC is 140, and the answer choices are wrong, but the closest is D.120. 

Final Answer: D

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup  
We are given several geometric entities:  

- **Points**: A, B, C, D lie on the circle E.  
- **Lines**: Line segments AB and BC form ∠ABC.  
- **Arcs**: Minor arc AC (denoted as $x$) and major arc ADC (denoted as $y$) exist on the circle.  
- **Angles**: ∠ABC = 70°.  
- **Measure relationships**:  
  - $x + y = 360^\circ$, since together they form the full circle.  
  - $\text{m}∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{measure of arc AC}$, as per the given predicate.  

---

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis  

From the given, we know:  
$$
\text{m}∠ABC = 70^\circ
$$
According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Here, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, and therefore:  
$$
\text{m}∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{measure of arc AC}
$$
Substituting the given angle:  
$$
70 = \frac{1}{2} \times x \Rightarrow x = 140
$$

So, the measure of the **minor arc AC** is $x = 140^\circ$.  
Then, since the total circle is 360°, the measure of the **major arc ADC**, denoted as $y$, is:  
$$
y = 360 - x = 360 - 140 = 220^\circ
$$

### Step 3: Solution Strategy  

We are asked to find the measure of **minor arc AC**, which is $x$. From our earlier derivation, $x = 140^\circ$. However, this value is **not listed among the answer choices**. This discrepancy raises questions about potential errors in the problem or misinterpretation of the arc being measured.  

Still, the logic remains consistent with the given data and the inscribed angle theorem. The arc AC is the **intercepted arc** of ∠ABC, and thus, the only consistent value is $x = 140^\circ$. However, since this is not an option, we consider whether the arc being referenced in the problem might differ — possibly due to a mislabeling of arcs or a misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing.

Despite this ambiguity, the **only mathematically consistent answer** derived from the given data is $x = 140^\circ$. Among the answer choices, **none match this value**, suggesting a potential error in the problem setup. But if forced to choose the closest plausible answer (though not logically aligned), the nearest is **Option D (120)**, although strictly speaking, this is not supported by the given information.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation  

Using the given information and applying the inscribed angle theorem:  
$$
\text{m}∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc AC} \Rightarrow x = 140^\circ
$$

Since this value is not among the answer choices, and the rest of the reasoning fails to yield an alternate consistent value, the **most logical conclusion** is that the correct answer is likely intended to be **140**, even though it is not listed.

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection  

While the calculation shows $x = 140^\circ$, this is **not an option** in the given list. Nevertheless, the only viable interpretation of the given data leads to this result, and the answer choices are incomplete or erroneous. Assuming the intent of the question is to ask for the measure of **arc AC**, and that the options may have been misaligned, the **closest possible match** to the derived value is **120**, though it does not logically follow from the given premises.
