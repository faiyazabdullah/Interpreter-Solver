MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several points: D, Y, A, E, B, I, G, H. There are lines connecting some of these points: Line(D,Y), Line(Y,A), Line(E,B), Line(B,I), Line(B,G), Line(H,G). Also, there are angles mentioned: Angle(D,Y,A), Angle(B,Y,A), Angle(E,B,G) with specific measures. 

The main question is to find the value of variable y. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 50, C. 60, D. 80. 

Let me break down the given predicates. 

First, the angles at point Y. We have two angles: Angle(D,Y,A) and Angle(B,Y,A). Their measures are given as 3x - 15 and y + 25 respectively. Also, it's stated that the sum of these two angles is 180 degrees. So, adding them together gives 180. That seems like a key equation here. 

So, writing that equation: (3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180. Simplifying that would give 3x + y + 10 = 180 → 3x + y = 170. But wait, I don't know if that's enough yet because we have two variables here, x and y. So maybe there's another equation involving x or y from other parts of the diagram?

Looking further, there's another angle mentioned: Angle(E,B,G) has measure 105 degrees. Now, how does this relate to the rest? Let me visualize the points. Points E, B, G are connected by lines: Line(E,B), Line(B,I), Line(B,G). Wait, so point B is connected to E, I, and G. So perhaps triangle EBG? Or maybe some other configuration. 

But how does this angle relate to the previous ones? Maybe there's a relationship between angles around point B or something else. Alternatively, since there's a line from B to I and B to G, perhaps there's a triangle involving those points. However, without more info about other angles or sides, it's hard to say directly. 

Wait, but maybe the key lies in the first part where we have two angles at point Y forming a straight line? Because the lines D-Y-A and B-Y-A suggest that points D, Y, A are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, the lines are Line(D,Y) and Line(Y,A). So that implies that points D, Y, A are colinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Therefore, angle DYA is a straight angle? Wait, no. Wait, the angle mentioned is Angle(D,Y,A). So vertex at Y, with segments YD and YA. Since D-Y and Y-A are lines, then angle at Y between D and A is a straight angle? Wait, no. If D, Y, A are colinear, then the angle between YD and YA would be 180 degrees. But according to the given, the sum of angles at Y (from D,Y,A and B,Y,A) equals 180. Wait, that suggests that those two angles form a linear pair, hence supplementary. So that means that the two angles at Y add up to 180 degrees. Which matches the given SumOf predicate. So that gives us the equation (3x -15) + (y +25) = 180. 

So that's one equation. But we need another equation to solve for y. Where can we get another equation? 

Looking at the other angle: Angle(E,B,G) = 105 degrees. How does this connect to the rest? Let me think. Point B is connected to E, I, and G. So points E, B, G are connected via lines EB, BG, and BI. Wait, maybe there's a triangle involved here. For example, triangle EBG? But unless there's more info about angles in that triangle, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, could there be some relationship between angles at point B? For instance, if there's a transversal or something? Wait, but I don't see immediate connections. Unless there's a vertical angle or something else. 

Wait, maybe the lines from B to I and B to G form some angles. Let me check the points again. Points B is connected to E, I, and G. So point B has three lines coming out: BE, BI, BG. So maybe there are multiple angles at point B. But the given angle is Angle(E,B,G), which is the angle at B between points E and G. So that's angle EBG = 105 degrees. 

Now, considering that, perhaps there's a way to relate this angle to other angles in the diagram. But how? Maybe if there are other angles at point B that can be expressed in terms of variables, allowing us to set up equations. 

Wait, but do we have any other angles involving point B? The only other angle mentioned is Angle(B,Y,A), which is part of the earlier equation. Let me think. 

Wait, the line from B to I exists. Is there any relation between that line and other elements? For example, if line BI intersects with some other lines? Or maybe forms a triangle with other points? 

Alternatively, perhaps triangle BGI? But without knowing other angles or sides, it's difficult. 

Wait, but maybe there's a triangle involving points Y, B, and something else. For example, if there's a connection between Y and B? Let me check the lines again. The lines given are Line(D,Y), Line(Y,A), Line(E,B), Line(B,I), Line(B,G), Line(H,G). So point Y is connected to D and A; point B is connected to E, I, G. Are there any lines connecting Y to B? Not explicitly stated. So maybe Y and B are separate points. 

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me go back to the first equation. We had:

(3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180  
Which simplifies to 3x + y + 10 = 180  
So 3x + y = 170.  

That's one equation with two variables. To find y, we need another equation involving x or y. 

Is there another equation from the other angle given, which is Angle(E,B,G) = 105 degrees? Maybe that angle relates to another part of the diagram. Let's consider that angle. 

Since Angle(E,B,G) is 105 degrees, and points E, B, G are connected. Let me imagine triangle EBG. In triangle EBG, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. But we only know one angle, which is 105 degrees. Without more info, we can't determine other angles. Unless there's a relationship between angles in that triangle and other parts of the diagram. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a relationship between angles at point B. For example, if there's a line from B to Y? If such a line existed, then angles at B could be related. But there's no mention of line BY. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved. But there's no info about parallelism given. 

Wait, but looking at the lines: Line(B,I) and Line(B,G). So from point B, lines go to I and G. If there's another line from B to somewhere else... Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at point B (angle EBG = 105°) is adjacent to another angle that can be expressed in terms of variables. For example, if there's another angle at point B formed by line BI and another line. 

Wait, but we don't have info about other angles at point B. Unless there's a triangle involving BI and other lines. 

This seems stuck. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving Y and B. For example, if there's a triangle YBA? But point Y is connected to D and A, and point B is connected to E, I, G. No direct connection between Y and B. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involving Y, B, and another point. But without knowing the connections, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but maybe the angles at point Y and point B are related through some other property. Like, if there's a transversal cutting through lines or something. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something. But without knowing which points lie on a circle, it's hard to use that. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to express x in terms of y or vice versa from another part of the diagram. Let me check again. 

The only other given angle is 105°, which is angle EBG. Suppose that angle is part of a triangle where another angle is related to y. For example, if there's a triangle where one angle is y + 25°, and another is 105°, leading to an equation. But how?

Wait, let's suppose that angle EBG (105°) is part of a triangle that includes angle B,Y,A. Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a vertical angle or corresponding angles. For example, if lines intersect, creating vertical angles. But again, without knowing which lines intersect, it's tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's an intersection between line BI and line YA? For example, if line BI crosses line YA at some point. But there's no info about that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points Y, B, and G. For example, if there's a triangle YBG. Then, the angles in that triangle could be considered. But we don't know any angles except angle at B, which is 105°, and maybe others. 

Wait, if we assume that points Y, B, G are connected, but there's no line specified between Y and G. The lines given are Line(H,G), but not sure. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the given data. 

The given lines are:

- Line(D,Y)
- Line(Y,A)
- Line(E,B)
- Line(B,I)
- Line(B,G)
- Line(H,G)

Points: D, Y, A, E, B, I, G, H. 

Angles:

- Angle(D,Y,A): 3x - 15
- Angle(B,Y,A): y + 25
- Sum of these two angles is 180°
- Angle(E,B,G): 105°

So, from the first two angles, we have the equation 3x + y = 170. Need another equation. 

Maybe the angle at B, which is 105°, is related to another angle that involves y? Let me think. 

For example, if there's a triangle where angle at B is 105°, and another angle is y + 25°, then the third angle could be found. But how to link them? 

Alternatively, if angle EBG (105°) is an exterior angle to some triangle, which would make it equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. 

Suppose that angle EBG is an exterior angle to triangle YBA or something. Let me try to imagine. 

If there's a triangle where one side is extended, making an exterior angle. For example, if line BG is an extension of some line, creating an exterior angle. 

Alternatively, maybe angle EBG is supplementary to another angle. 

Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines from B to I and B to G form certain angles that relate to the other angles. 

Wait, since angle EBG is 105°, and point B is connected to I and G, maybe there's another angle at point B involving line BI. For example, if line BI creates an angle with line BG, which is 105°, and another angle with another line. 

But unless we know more about the angles at B, this is speculative. 

Wait, but maybe the sum of angles around point B? The total around a point is 360°. If we can find other angles at point B, we could set up an equation. 

At point B, we have lines going to E, I, and G. So, the angles at B would be:

- Angle between BE and BI
- Angle between BI and BG
- Angle between BG and BE (which is the given angle EBG of 105°)

But we don't know the measures of the other angles. Unless there's another angle given. 

Wait, but there's also angle B,Y,A which is y + 25°. Is that angle related to point B? Let me check. 

Angle(B,Y,A) is the angle at Y, not at B. So that's different. 

Wait, but maybe there's a connection between the angle at Y and the angles at B. For example, if lines from Y to B exist? 

But there's no line specified between Y and B. So unless inferred from other lines. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle YBA has some relation to angle EBG. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines from B to I and B to G form a straight line? But that's not indicated. 

I'm stuck here. Maybe there's another way. Let me think again about the initial equation: 3x + y = 170. If I can find another equation involving x or y, I can solve for y. 

But how? 

Wait, the angle at E,B,G is 105°, and maybe that's part of a triangle where another angle is related to x or y. 

Wait, for example, if there's a triangle involving point Y and point B. Suppose that line YB exists, connecting Y and B. Then, maybe triangle YBE or something. But since there's no explicit line mentioned between Y and B, this is uncertain. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines from B to G and from Y to A are related? 

Wait, if line BG is connected to point G, and line YA is connected to Y and A. But again, no direct connection. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an alternate interior angle or something else. 

Wait, but without more info, I'm not able to proceed. Perhaps there's an assumption I missed? 

Wait, the problem says to use the given predicates systematically. Let me check if there are any other equalities or relationships. 

Wait, the given predicates include Line(H,G). So point H is connected to G. But I don't see how that connects to the rest. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving H and G? Or some other points? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a right angle somewhere. For example, if two lines are perpendicular, but there's no info about that. 

Wait, but the problem mentions Angle(E,B,G) = 105°, which is not a right angle. 

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let me reconsider the original equation. 

We have 3x + y = 170. If I could express x in terms of y or vice versa, but I need another equation. 

Wait, maybe x is related to the angle at E,B,G. For example, if there's a triangle where angle EBG is 105°, and another angle is 3x -15 or something. 

Wait, for instance, if angle EBG is an exterior angle to a triangle containing angle D,Y,A or something. Let me try to imagine. 

Suppose there's a triangle where one angle is 105°, and another angle is 3x -15°, then the third angle would be something. But how to connect them. 

Alternatively, if the lines EA and GB are parallel, then some angles would be equal. But there's no info about parallel lines. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle DYA has some relation to angle EBG. But again, not sure. 

Wait, but the problem states that the user must use the given predicates. Let me list all given predicates again:

Predicates:

- Angle(D,Y,A)
- Angle(B,Y,A)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,Y,A)), 3x - 15)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,Y,A)), y + 25)
- SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(D,Y,A)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,Y,A)), 180)
- Angle(E,B,G)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,G)), 105)
- Lines: Line(D,Y), Line(Y,A), Line(E,B), Line(B,I), Line(B,G), Line(H,G)
- Points: D, Y, A, E, B, I, G, H

So, the only angles given are those three. The rest are lines and points. 

Wait, maybe the angle at E,B,G (105°) is related to the angle at Y. For example, if lines EG and YA are parallel, creating corresponding angles. But again, no info about parallel lines. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points E, B, Y. For example, if there's a line from Y to B. 

But since there's no line specified between Y and B, this is an assumption. But maybe the problem assumes that such a line exists? 

Wait, if we assume that points Y and B are connected by a line, then we could form triangle YBE or YBG. Let me try that. 

Assume that there's a line from Y to B. Then, at point B, we have angles involving lines BE, BI, BG, and possibly BY. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is guesswork. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at B (E,B,G) is related to the angle at Y (B,Y,A). For example, if lines BG and YA are parallel, then the angle EBG would be equal to some other angle. 

But without knowing that, this is just speculation. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to express x in terms of y using the given equations. Let me see. From the first equation: 3x + y = 170. If I can find another equation involving x or y. 

But how? 

Wait, perhaps the angle at E,B,G (105°) is part of a triangle where one of the angles is y + 25°. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 105°, y + 25°, and another angle, which could be 3x -15°. 

But that's assuming that those angles are in the same triangle. 

For example, suppose triangle EBG has angles 105°, and two other angles. If one of those angles is y + 25°, then the third angle would be 180 - 105 - (y+25) = 50 - y. 

But why would that angle be related to the other expression? 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where one angle is 3x -15° and another is 105°, leading to an equation. 

But this requires assuming a connection between the angles, which isn't explicitly given. 

Wait, but maybe there's a straight line somewhere. For example, if points E, B, and some other point are colinear, forming a straight angle. 

Alternatively, if angle EBG is part of a larger angle that includes y + 25°. 

This is too vague. Maybe there's another way. 

Wait, let's look back at the equation 3x + y = 170. If I can find another equation involving x, perhaps from the angle EBG. 

But how? 

Unless there's a triangle where one angle is 3x -15° and another is 105°, but that's pure guesswork. 

Wait, maybe the angle at E,B,G (105°) is supplementary to another angle. For example, if it forms a linear pair with angle B,Y,A. 

But angle B,Y,A is y + 25°, so if they are supplementary, then 105 + y +25 = 180 → y = 40. But that's assuming they're supplementary, which may not be true. 

But why would they be supplementary? If points E, B, and Y are colinear? 

Wait, if line EB is connected to Y, then maybe angle EBG and angle B,Y,A are supplementary. But again, this is assuming a connection between points E, B, and Y, which isn't given. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at E,B,G (105°) is equal to angle D,Y,A (3x -15). So 3x -15 = 105 → 3x = 120 → x=40. Then substituting into the first equation: 3*40 + y = 170 → 120 + y = 170 → y = 50. Which would make y = 50, matching choice B. 

But why would those angles be equal? Unless there's a reason for them to be equal. 

Wait, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines causing those angles to be equal. For example, if lines DG and EB are parallel, and some transversal causes corresponding angles. But there's no info about that. 

However, this is a possibility. If I take that assumption, then I get y = 50, which is one of the options. 

But is there any basis for assuming that angle D,Y,A (which is 3x-15) equals angle E,B,G (which is 105)? 

Well, if those angles are vertically opposite, or alternate interior, or corresponding, then they could be equal. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is a stretch. 

But given that this leads to an answer that matches one of the choices, and since we need to choose from the given options, this might be the intended path. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's say that angle E,B,G is 105°, and this is an external angle to a triangle where one of the internal angles is y + 25°. 

In that case, the external angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles. So, 105° = (y + 25) + something. But if the something is 3x -15, then 105 = y + 25 + 3x -15 → 105 = y + 3x +10 → 3x + y = 95. But earlier we had 3x + y = 170. Contradiction. 

So that doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if the external angle is 105°, and one of the internal angles is y + 25, then the other internal angle would be 105 - (y + 25) = 80 - y. 

But without knowing what that other angle represents, we can't proceed. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles y + 25 and 105, then third angle is 180 - (y +25) -105 = 50 - y. 

Again, no connection to x. 

But if we assume that this third angle is equal to 3x -15, then:

50 - y = 3x -15 → 3x + y = 65. But earlier equation was 3x + y = 170. Again, contradiction. 

So this approach doesn't work. 

Back to the earlier idea: if angle D,Y,A (3x -15) equals angle E,B,G (105), then 3x -15 = 105 → 3x = 120 → x=40. Substituting into 3x + y = 170 → 120 + y = 170 → y=50. Which is option B. 

But why would those angles be equal? It depends on the diagram. If lines DG and EB are parallel, and there's a transversal creating corresponding angles. 

Alternatively, if the diagram has some symmetry or other properties. Since this leads to a valid answer and matches one of the choices, and given that in many problems, such assumptions are made when there's insufficient information, this might be the intended solution. 

Therefore, the value of y is 50, which corresponds to choice B.
