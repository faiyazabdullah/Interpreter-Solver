MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. The question is asking for the measure of a central angle. The answer choices are 30, 60, 90, or 120 degrees. 

First, I need to recall what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides equal and all interior angles equal. Since it's inscribed in a circle, all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. In such cases, the center of the circle is also the center of the polygon. 

Now, the central angle refers to the angle formed at the center of the circle by two adjacent vertices of the polygon. For example, if we take two consecutive points on the polygon, say J and K, then the angle at the center R between those two points would be the central angle. 

I remember that the sum of all central angles around a point is 360 degrees. Since the polygon is regular, all these central angles are equal. Therefore, if there are n sides in the polygon, each central angle would be 360 divided by n. 

But wait, how do I find out how many sides the polygon has? Let me check the given predicates again. The Regular(Polygon(J,K,L,M,N,P)) indicates that the polygon has six vertices: J, K, L, M, N, P. Wait, but polygons are named with their vertices, so if there are six letters listed here (J, K, L, M, N, P), that suggests it's a hexagon. So n=6. 

Therefore, each central angle would be 360 / 6 = 60 degrees. That seems straightforward. But let me verify with the given data. 

Looking back at the predicates, they mention several lines from point R (the center) to each vertex: Line(R,J), Line(R,K), etc., up to Line(R,P). Each of these lines is a radius of the circle since the polygon is inscribed in the circle. Also, the lengths of these radii are all equal because all sides of the regular polygon are equal. Wait, actually, the length of each radius should be the same, but the problem states that the lengths of Line(R,J), Line(R,K), etc., are equal. Wait, no—the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,J)), LengthOf(Line(R,K))), and similarly for others. So that confirms that all these radii are equal, which makes sense for a regular polygon. 

Additionally, the angles at the center—like Angle(R,J,K)—are all equal. The SumOf(...) equals 360 degrees, which aligns with the fact that the total central angles add up to 360. Since there are six angles (each corresponding to one side of the hexagon), each is 360/6 = 60 degrees. 

So the measure of each central angle is 60 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, B is 60. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Wait, but just to make sure there isn't any trick here. Is there any possibility that the polygon could have a different number of sides? The Regular(Polygon(...)) lists six points: J, K, L, M, N, P. So that's six vertices, making it a hexagon. Hence, n=6. So yes, 360/6=60. 

Another way to think about it: in a regular hexagon, each central angle is indeed 60 degrees because each side corresponds to a sixth of the full circle. This is a well-known property. So the answer must be B.
