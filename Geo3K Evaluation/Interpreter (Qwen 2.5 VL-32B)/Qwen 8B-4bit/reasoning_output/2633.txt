MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have angles 2 and 3, where the measure of angle 2 is twice x, and angle 3 is x. We need to find the measure of angle 3, which is x. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. 

First, I should check if there's any relationship between these angles. Since angle 2 is 2x and angle 3 is x, maybe they form a linear pair or something? Wait, but without knowing the diagram, it's tricky. But looking at the predicates, there are points and lines mentioned. Let me think about the given lines and points.

Looking at the points and lines: Points E, F, B, H, J, G, A. Lines like Line(F,E), Line(E,B), Line(B,H), Line(H,J), Line(J,F). That seems like a pentagon or some polygon. Also, there's a point G connected to A, B, H, J, F. Maybe G is the center of a circle since there's a Circle(G) mentioned. So G could be the center, and lines GA, GB, GH, GJ, GF are radii?

Wait, the Circle(G) would mean that G is the center. Then lines from G to other points are radii. So points A, B, H, J, F lie on the circumference of the circle centered at G. 

Now, looking at the lines connecting those points. For example, Line(F,E), Line(E,B)... Maybe E is another point on the circle? Or maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there are triangles formed here. Like triangle EBF, or others. 

But the main thing is the angles given. Angle 2 and Angle 3. The problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(2)) equals 2x, and MeasureOf(Angle(3)) equals x. So maybe these angles are parts of triangles or intersecting lines. 

Since there's a circle involved, perhaps these angles are inscribed angles or central angles. If angle 2 and 3 are related to arcs on the circle, then their measures would relate to the arcs. For instance, a central angle has measure equal to the arc it subtends, while an inscribed angle is half that. 

Let me consider that. Suppose angle 2 is a central angle, so its measure is equal to the arc it intercepts. Similarly, angle 3 could be an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc. Wait, but if angle 2 is 2x and angle 3 is x, then maybe angle 2 is twice angle 3. Which would make sense if angle 3 is an inscribed angle and angle 2 is the corresponding central angle. 

So, if angle 2 is a central angle, then the arc it intercepts is 2x. And angle 3, being an inscribed angle over the same arc, would be half of that, so x. Therefore, that fits the given equations. 

So if angle 2 is a central angle and angle 3 is an inscribed angle over the same arc, then their measures would satisfy m∠2 = 2 * m∠3. Which aligns with the given: m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. 

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding x such that these angles fit into the circle. However, we need more information. Are there any other constraints? The problem doesn't specify particular arcs or other angles, but maybe there's a way to find x using other properties. 

Alternatively, maybe angles 2 and 3 are part of a triangle. For example, if they are two angles in a triangle, then their sum plus the third angle equals 180 degrees. But without knowing if they are in a triangle, this is uncertain. 

Wait, but the problem gives us that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. So combining them, 2x + x = 3x. If they are supplementary, then 3x = 180, leading to x=60. But if they are complementary, then 3x=90, x=30. But how do we know if they are supplementary or complementary?

Alternatively, maybe they are angles in a triangle. Let's say they are two angles in a triangle. Then the third angle would be 180 - 3x. But again, unless there's more info, this isn't helpful. 

Wait, but considering the circle. If angle 3 is an inscribed angle, and angle 2 is a central angle, then the arc intercepted by angle 2 is 2x, and angle 3 intercepts the same arc, making it x. Now, if there's another angle or arc related, perhaps we can find another equation. 

For example, suppose angle 3 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, and angle 2 is a central angle intercepting the same arc AB. Then, yes, angle 2 would be 2x, angle 3 would be x. But then, if there's another arc or another angle, maybe involving other points. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle that's inscribed in the circle. For instance, if points E, B, and another point form a triangle with angles 2 and 3. 

But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. However, the answer choices suggest that x is likely 30 or 60 because they're common angles. 

Wait, if angle 2 and angle 3 add up to 90 degrees (complementary), then x would be 30. If they add up to 180 degrees (supplementary), then x is 60. But why would they be complementary or supplementary? 

Another thought: if angle 2 and angle 3 are adjacent angles forming a straight line, then they'd be supplementary. But again, without knowing the diagram, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle where the third angle is known. For example, if angle 2 is 2x and angle 3 is x, and the third angle is something else. But again, no info. 

Wait, but the problem says to use the given predicates. Let me look back. There are several lines drawn. For example, Line(F,E), Line(E,B), Line(B,H), Line(H,J), Line(J,F). So points F-E-B-H-J-F form a pentagon? Or maybe a star? Also, G is connected to A, B, H, J, F. So G is connected to five points. That suggests that G is the center of the circle passing through A, B, H, J, F. 

Perhaps the points A, B, H, J, F are on the circumference of the circle centered at G. Then lines from G to these points are radii. 

Now, if there's a triangle involving these points. For example, triangle GEB? Or maybe triangle EBF? 

Alternatively, maybe angles 2 and 3 are angles formed by intersecting chords. For instance, when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Suppose angle 2 is formed by two chords intersecting at point G. Wait, but G is the center. If two chords intersect at the center, then the angle between them is a central angle, measuring the arc between the two points. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is an inscribed angle. Let me think. 

Assume that angle 2 is a central angle, so it's 2x. Then, angle 3 is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc, so it's x. If there's another arc or another angle that relates to these, we can find x. 

But how? Without more information, perhaps the total of arcs around the circle adds up to 360 degrees. 

Suppose the arc intercepted by angle 2 (which is 2x) and another arc intercepted by angle 3 (which is x). But unless there's more, it's unclear. 

Wait, maybe angle 2 and angle 3 are vertical angles or something. Or maybe they are angles in a triangle where the third angle is known. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle with angle 2. For example, if angle 2 and angle 3 are two angles in a triangle, then the third angle would be 180 - 3x. But again, without knowing anything else, this is just speculation. 

Wait, but the answer options are 30, 45, 60, 90. Let's assume that angle 2 and angle 3 are part of a triangle where the third angle is also known. For instance, if angle 2 and angle 3 are in a triangle, and the third angle is 90 degrees (right angle). Then:

x + 2x + 90 = 180 → 3x = 90 → x = 30. So angle 3 would be 30, which is option A. 

Or if the third angle is 60, then 3x + 60 = 180 → x = 40, which is not among the options. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 3 are complementary, then x + 2x = 90 → 3x = 90 → x = 30. Again, same result. 

But why would they be complementary? Unless they are two angles that form a right angle. 

But without more information, this is guesswork. However, given the answer choices, 30 and 60 are possibilities. 

Wait, another possibility: if angle 2 is twice angle 3, and they are angles in a triangle with another angle. For example, if the triangle has angles x, 2x, and another angle y. Then x + 2x + y = 180. But without knowing y, we can't proceed. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a cyclic quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. But again, without knowing if they are opposite, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, if angle 3 is an inscribed angle intercepting an arc that is twice angle 3, and angle 2 is the central angle. So, if angle 3 is x, then the arc is 2x, and angle 2 is 2x. Wait, but that would make angle 2 equal to the arc. But then, if there's another arc that relates to angle 3, maybe... 

Wait, maybe there's a scenario where angle 2 is a central angle and angle 3 is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc. So angle 2 = 2 * angle 3. Hence, 2x = 2 * x. Wait, that's redundant. Oh, wait, no. If angle 2 is a central angle, then it's equal to the arc. If angle 3 is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc, then it's half the arc. So angle 2 = arc measure, angle 3 = (arc measure)/2. Thus, angle 2 = 2 * angle 3. Which is exactly the case here. So angle 2 is twice angle 3. Therefore, if we can find the measure of angle 2 or angle 3, we can solve for x. 

But how? Without knowing any specific measures, how can we determine x? Unless there's another constraint. 

Ah! Maybe angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle where the third angle is known. For example, if angle 2 and angle 3 are two angles in a triangle, and the third angle is 90 degrees (right angle), then:

x + 2x + 90 = 180 → 3x = 90 → x = 30. 

This would lead to angle 3 being 30 degrees, which is option A. 

Alternatively, if the third angle was something else, like 60 degrees, then x = 40, which isn't an option. 

But how do we know that the third angle is 90 degrees? Because maybe the triangle is a right triangle. How could that happen? If one of the sides is a diameter of the circle. 

For example, suppose that points A and B are endpoints of a diameter of the circle centered at G. Then, any triangle inscribed with AB as the diameter would have a right angle. 

But in our case, points A and B are connected via Line(G,A) and Line(G,B), implying that GA and GB are radii. So AB is a chord of the circle, not necessarily a diameter. Unless points A and B are diametrically opposite. 

But without knowing that, we can't assume that. 

However, if angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtended by the diameter AB, then angle 3 would be a right angle. Wait, but angle 3 is x. If angle 3 were a right angle, then x=90, which is option D. But that contradicts the earlier assumption. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me re-examine. 

If angle 3 is an inscribed angle subtending an arc that is 2x, then angle 3 = x. If angle 2 is a central angle subtending the same arc, then angle 2 = 2x. 

But if there's another arc that completes the circle. Let's imagine that the total circumference is 360 degrees. Suppose that the arc subtended by angle 2 is 2x, and there's another arc that forms the rest. But without more info, this is too vague. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 3 are angles formed by intersecting chords. For example, if two chords intersect inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Suppose angle 2 is formed by two chords intersecting at point G (the center), so it's a central angle. If angle 3 is formed by two other chords, perhaps. 

Wait, if two chords intersect at G, then the angle between them is a central angle. For instance, if two chords FG and BG intersect at G, then the angle between them is angle FGB. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is an inscribed angle formed by points on the circumference. 

Given the uncertainty, but considering that the answer choices are standard angles, and assuming that angle 2 and angle 3 are complementary, leading to x=30, which is option A, or supplementary, leading to x=60, option C. 

Which is more likely? Well, in many geometry problems, especially with circles, angles often come in pairs where one is double the other, and sometimes they are complementary or supplementary. 

If angle 2 is twice angle 3, and they are part of a triangle where the third angle is 90 degrees, then x=30. Alternatively, if they are supplementary, then x=60. 

But how to decide? Let's think of a typical configuration. For example, if angle 2 is a central angle and angle 3 is an inscribed angle over the same arc, and there's a right angle elsewhere. 

Alternatively, if angle 3 is an inscribed angle over an arc that is 2x, and angle 2 is another angle in the circle. 

But without more data, it's difficult. Given that the answer choices are A-D, and if I assume that angle 2 and angle 3 are complementary, then x=30. This is a common angle in geometry. 

Alternatively, if they are in a triangle with a right angle, x=30. Another possibility is that angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in an equilateral triangle, but that would require each angle to be 60 degrees, but here angle 2 is twice angle 3, so that wouldn't fit. 

Wait, if angle 3 is 60 degrees, then angle 2 would be 120 degrees. These could be angles in a triangle where the third angle is 0, which is impossible. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle with another angle. For example, if angle 2 = 2x, angle 3 = x, and the third angle is 180 - 3x. If that third angle is also related to the circle, say, a right angle. Then 180 - 3x = 90 => x=30. So angle 3 would be 30. 

That seems plausible. Therefore, the answer would be A. 30. 

But why would the third angle be a right angle? It could be due to the circle's properties. For example, if the third angle is an inscribed angle subtending a semicircle, hence being 90 degrees. 

In that case, angle 3 would be 30. 

Thus, the answer is A. 30.
