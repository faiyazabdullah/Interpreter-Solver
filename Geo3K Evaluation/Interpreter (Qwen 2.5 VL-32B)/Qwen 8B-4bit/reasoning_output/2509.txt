====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 14 given that angle 1 is 123 degrees. 

First, I need to look at the given predicates. There are several angles mentioned with relations like supplementary, vertical, corresponding, and alternate interior. Let me list them out again:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), 123): So angle 1 is 123°.
- Supplementary(Angle(1), Angle(2)): That means angle 1 and angle 2 add up to 180°, so angle 2 would be 180 - 123 = 57°.
- Vertical(Angle(1), Angle(3)): Vertical angles are equal, so angle 3 is also 123°.
- Corresponding(Angle(1), Angle(5)): Corresponding angles are equal, so angle 5 equals angle 1, which is 123°.
- AlternateInterior(Angle(1), Angle(7)): Alternate interior angles are equal, so angle 7 is 123°.

Now looking at the other side for angle 14:

- Supplementary(Angle(14), Angle(13)): So angle 14 + angle 13 = 180°.
- Vertical(Angle(14), Angle(12)): Therefore, angle 12 equals angle 14.
- Corresponding(Angle(14), Angle(10)): So angle 10 equals angle 14.
- AlternateInterior(Angle(14), Angle(8)): Thus, angle 8 equals angle 14.

Wait, but how do these relate back to angle 1? Maybe there's some relationship between angles 1 and 14 via the intersecting lines?

Looking at the lines: The points form a series of intersecting lines. For example, Line(A,B) intersects Line(C,D) at O, then Line(C,D) intersects Line(E,F) at K, and so on. These intersections likely create various angles. Since there are multiple pairs of vertical, corresponding, and alternate interior angles, maybe angle 14 is part of a set that relates to angle 1 through these properties.

But angle 1 is given as 123°, which is obtuse. Since vertical angles are equal, and corresponding and alternate interior angles are equal, perhaps angle 14 is related through some of these. However, if angle 14 is vertical to another angle, say angle 12, and angle 12 could be supplementary to angle 13, but without knowing more about the configuration, it's tricky. Wait, but maybe angle 14 is formed in such a way that it's supplementary to another angle that's related to angle 1.

Alternatively, since angle 1 is 123°, and angle 2 is 57°, maybe angle 14 is connected through some transversal lines. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Let me recall that when two lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Also, vertical angles are equal. So if angle 1 is 123°, and suppose that angle 14 is either a corresponding, alternate interior, or vertical angle to another angle that we can find.

Wait, but the problem gives us that angle 14 has certain relationships. Specifically, angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, vertical to angle 12, corresponds to angle 10, and is alternate interior with angle 8. So angle 14 is equal to angles 12, 10, and 8. And angle 14 plus angle 13 equals 180°.

But how does this connect back to angle 1? Maybe there's a chain of relationships. For instance, if angle 1 is part of a transversal setup where angle 14 is formed due to some intersection. Alternatively, maybe angle 14 is a vertical angle to an angle that's supplementary to angle 1. Or perhaps angle 14 is part of a triangle or some polygon where we can use the sum of angles.

Alternatively, considering that angle 1 is 123°, which is an obtuse angle, and if angle 14 is part of a linear pair with another angle, maybe angle 14 is acute. For example, if angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, and angle 13 is somehow related to angle 1.

Wait, but I need to find a direct link. Let's see. Suppose angle 1 is one of the angles formed by two intersecting lines, and angle 14 is another angle formed in a different transversal. But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to tell. However, the given predicates may have enough info.

Wait, let's check the relationships again. Angle 1 is supplementary to angle 2, vertical to angle 3, corresponding to angle 5, and alternate interior to angle 7. Then, angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, vertical to angle 12, corresponding to angle 10, and alternate interior to angle 8. So each of those angles (angles 2,3,5,7,13,12,10,8) are related to angles 1 and 14 respectively.

But unless there's a connection between angle 1 and angle 14 through some transversals or parallel lines, maybe they are part of the same set of intersecting lines. For example, if angle 1 and angle 14 are vertical angles, but that's not stated. Or maybe angle 14 is an alternate interior angle to angle 1, making them equal. But angle 1 is 123°, which would make angle 14 also 123°, but that's option D. But wait, the answer options include D as 123. But maybe that's not the case because angle 14 is supplementary to another angle.

Wait, the problem says that angle 1 is 123°, and angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13. So angle 14 + angle 13 = 180. But if angle 13 is something else... Maybe angle 13 is related to angle 1 through some other relationship. But how?

Alternatively, maybe angle 14 is vertical to angle 12, which could be corresponding to angle 10, which might be an alternate interior angle to angle 8. But none of these directly link to angle 1. Unless there's a pattern. For example, angle 1 is supplementary to angle 2, which is vertical to angle 3, which is corresponding to angle 5, which is alternate interior to angle 7. Similarly, angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, vertical to angle 12, corresponding to angle 10, and alternate interior to angle 8. 

So if angle 14 is vertical to angle 12, and angle 12 is corresponding to angle 10, which is alternate interior to angle 8. But how does that tie back to angle 1? Maybe angle 8 is related to angle 1 through being alternate interior angles. Wait, angle 1 is an alternate interior angle to angle 7, and angle 14 is an alternate interior angle to angle 8. So if angle 7 is equal to angle 1 (which is 123°), then angle 8 would be something else? No, because alternate interior angles are equal. Wait, angle 1 is alternate interior to angle 7, so angle 7 equals angle 1, which is 123°. Then angle 8 is alternate interior to angle 14, so angle 8 equals angle 14. But how does that help?

Unless angle 8 is part of a linear pair with angle 1. For example, if angle 8 and angle 1 are supplementary. But that's just speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, and angle 13 is vertical to another angle, which is corresponding or alternate interior to angle 1. Let me think. If angle 13 is vertical to angle 12, which is corresponding to angle 10, which is alternate interior to angle 8. Not sure.

This seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. Since angle 1 is 123°, and angle 2 is supplementary to it, so angle 2 is 57°. Now, if angle 2 is vertical to another angle, say angle 3, which is 123°, but that doesn't help. Wait, but angle 2 is vertical to angle 3? Wait, no. The vertical angles are angle 1 and angle 3. Wait, the original statement was Vertical(Angle(1), Angle(3)), so angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical, hence equal. So angle 3 is 123°. Then angle 2 is supplementary to angle 1, so 57°, and angle 2 might be corresponding to another angle.

But how does this relate to angle 14? Let me think again. The problem mentions angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, vertical to angle 12, corresponding to angle 10, and alternate interior to angle 8. So if angle 14 is vertical to angle 12, then angle 12 = angle 14. Also, angle 14 corresponds to angle 10, so angle 10 = angle 14. And angle 14 is alternate interior to angle 8, so angle 8 = angle 14. So all those angles (12, 10, 8) are equal to angle 14. 

But how to find angle 14? Maybe angle 14 is part of a triangle or straight line. For example, if angle 14 is part of a straight line with angle 13, which makes angle 14 + angle 13 = 180. But if angle 13 is equal to angle 1, then angle 14 would be 57. Wait, that's possible. 

Wait, angle 13 is supplementary to angle 14. So angle 14 = 180 - angle 13. If angle 13 is equal to angle 1, which is 123°, then angle 14 = 180 - 123 = 57°, which would be option B. But why would angle 13 be equal to angle 1?

Is there a reason angle 13 equals angle 1? Let's see. Angle 1 is 123°, and angle 2 is 57°. Angle 13 is supplementary to angle 14. If angle 13 is vertical to angle 1, then angle 13 would be equal to angle 1, but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is corresponding or alternate interior to angle 1. 

Alternatively, angle 13 could be a corresponding angle to angle 1. If that's the case, then angle 13 would be equal to angle 1, which is 123°, leading to angle 14 = 180 - 123 = 57°, which is option B. But how do we know that angle 13 is corresponding to angle 1?

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is an alternate interior angle to angle 1. In that case, angle 13 would be equal to angle 1, so angle 14 = 180 - 123 = 57. 

But how to confirm that angle 13 is related to angle 1? Without seeing the diagram, this requires assuming that angle 13 is in a position where it forms a supplementary pair with angle 14, and that angle 13 is equal to angle 1 due to some parallel lines or transversal. Given that angle 1 is part of a series of intersecting lines, maybe angle 13 is created by the same transversal as angle 1, making them corresponding or alternate interior angles. 

Since angle 1 is 123°, and angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, and if angle 13 is equal to angle 1, then angle 14 would be 57°, which is option B. This seems plausible. 

Another possibility: angle 14 is vertical to angle 12, and angle 12 is corresponding to angle 10, which is alternate interior to angle 8. But none of these are directly linked to angle 1. However, if angle 1 is part of a transversal creating angle 14 through some relationship, like being supplementary or equal. 

Given that the answer options include 57 (option B), which is 180-123, and since angle 14 is supplementary to angle 13, and if angle 13 is equal to angle 1, then angle 14 is 57. 

Therefore, the measure of angle 14 is 57°, which is option B.
