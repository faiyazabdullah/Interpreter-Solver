MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two rhombuses, one is ABCD and the other is EFGH. They're similar, and we need to find the area of the green figure, which is the second rhombus. 

First, I'll recall that in similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since they're rhombuses, all sides are equal, so the ratio of their sides would be the same as the ratio of their diagonals or any corresponding linear dimensions.

Given that the first rhombus ABCD has an area of 36. Also, its diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O. Wait, but there's also info about the length of diagonal AC being 8 units. For a rhombus, the area can be calculated as (d1*d2)/2 where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So if AC is 8, then BD can be found using the area formula. Let me check that.

Area = (AC * BD)/2 = 36. Plugging in AC=8: (8*BD)/2 = 36 → 4*BD = 36 → BD = 9. So the diagonals are 8 and 9. Therefore, the lengths of the diagonals of ABCD are 8 and 9.

Now, since the rhombuses are similar, the ratio of their diagonals should be the same. Let me denote the diagonals of EFGH as EG and FH. Given that EG is 4 units. Since the original rhombus had diagonals 8 and 9, the ratio between the diagonals of EFGH and ABCD would be EG / AC = 4/8 = 1/2. But wait, similarity implies that all corresponding linear measurements are in proportion. However, which diagonal corresponds? Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, and the problem states that the lines AC and BD are perpendicular, same with EG and FH. So the diagonals of each rhombus are perpendicular.

But how do we know which diagonal corresponds between the two rhombuses? Well, since the similarity could be in any orientation, but the ratio would still hold. Let me think. The ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Alternatively, since the diagonals are proportional, the ratio of the areas would be the square of the ratio of the diagonals. Wait, but the diagonals aren't necessarily the same direction, but in a rhombus, the diagonals split it into four right triangles. Each half-diagonal forms legs of those right triangles. So if two rhombuses are similar, their diagonals must be in proportion. So the ratio of the lengths of the diagonals of the smaller to the larger would be the same as the ratio of their sides. 

Alternatively, since the area of the first rhombus is 36, and the second is similar, we can find the scaling factor. Let me try this approach.

Let’s denote the scale factor between ABCD and EFGH as k. Then, since they are similar, the ratio of their areas is k². We need to find the area of EFGH, which is the green figure.

To find k, we need to relate corresponding sides. But we don't have the side lengths directly. However, we have the length of EG (which is 4) as part of the second rhombus. In the first rhombus, the diagonals are 8 and 9. Let me compute the side length of ABCD. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, so each half of the diagonals forms a right triangle with legs (d1/2) and (d2/2). The side length s of the rhombus is sqrt[(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2]. 

So for ABCD, s = sqrt((8/2)^2 + (9/2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 20.25) = sqrt(36.25) = 6.02... Hmm, but maybe we don't need the actual side length. Instead, since the diagonals are 8 and 9, and the second rhombus has a diagonal EG of 4. Assuming that EG corresponds to AC (since they are both diagonals of the rhombus), then the ratio of EG to AC is 4/8 = 1/2. So the scale factor k is 1/2. Therefore, the area of EFGH would be (k^2)*area of ABCD = (1/2)^2 * 36 = 1/4 * 36 = 9. That would make the answer A. But wait, let me confirm that the correspondence of the diagonals is correct.

Wait, the problem says that Line(E,G) and Line(F,H) are perpendicular, just like Line(A,C) and Line(B,D). So the diagonals of EFGH are EG and FH, which are perpendicular. Similarly for ABCD. Now, since the rhombuses are similar, the ratios of their diagonals should be the same. However, we need to ensure that the diagonals correspond. For example, if EG corresponds to AC, then the ratio is 4/8 = 1/2. But perhaps EG corresponds to BD instead? Because in the first rhombus, the diagonals are 8 and 9. Suppose the diagonals of EFGH are scaled versions of either 8 or 9. But we only have one diagonal given for EFGH, which is EG = 4. How do we know which diagonal it corresponds to?

Wait, but since the problem mentions that the two rhombuses are similar, their diagonals are in proportion. So regardless of which diagonal is which, the ratio between the diagonals of EFGH and ABCD should be consistent. Let me consider that. Let me suppose that the diagonals of EFGH are in the same ratio as those of ABCD. The original rhombus has diagonals 8 and 9, so their ratio is 8:9. For the similar rhombus EFGH, the diagonals should also be in the ratio 8:9. However, we are told that one of the diagonals of EFGH is 4. Which one is it?

Assuming that EG corresponds to AC (the 8-unit diagonal) of ABCD, then EG is 4, so the scale factor is 4/8 = 1/2. Then the other diagonal of EFGH would be 9*(1/2) = 4.5. Thus, the area would be (4 * 4.5)/2 = 9, which matches our earlier calculation. Alternatively, if EG corresponds to BD (the 9-unit diagonal), then the scale factor would be 4/9, leading to the other diagonal being 8*(4/9) ≈ 3.555..., and area would be (4 * (32/9))/2 = (128/9)/2 = 64/9 ≈ 7.11, which isn't among the options. Hence, the correct assumption is that EG corresponds to AC (the 8-unit diagonal), making the scale factor 1/2, leading to area 9.

Therefore, the answer should be A. Let me double-check. The area of ABCD is 36, and if the scale factor is 1/2, then area scales by (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so 36*(1/4)=9. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is A.
