<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle DEP, given all these predicates about points, lines, angles, and some specific measurements. Let me start by going through each part step by step.

First, I'll parse the given information. There are several points mentioned: A, E, C, B, D, F, P. Lines connecting them form various structures. Also, there are angles and their measures given, along with some perpendicularity conditions and right angles. Plus, P is the incenter of triangle AEC.

Let me recall that the incenter of a triangle is the intersection point of the angle bisectors. Since P is the incenter, it should lie at the intersection of the bisectors of angles A, E, and C in triangle AEC. Also, the incenter is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

Looking at the given predicates, there are several angle bisectors mentioned. For instance, Line(AP) bisects angle EAC, Line EP bisects angle AEC, and Line CP bisects angle ACE. That aligns with the incenter property since those lines would be the angle bisectors.

Now, the question is about angle DEP. Points D, E, and P. So, I need to find the measure of angle formed at point E between points D and P. To do this, maybe I can find coordinates of these points or use other angle relations?

But first, let's note down all the given angle measures. We have:

- Measure of angle BAC is 33 degrees? Wait, looking back:

Wait, the Equals statements say:

MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, C)) = 33

Which is angle at A between B and C. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)) is also 33. Then MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) is 28.5, which is angle at B between C and A. And MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)) is also 28.5, which is angle at C between B and A. 

So, triangle ABC has angles at A and B each 33 degrees, and angle at B (wait, wait, need to clarify). Wait, angle CAB is 33 degrees (since Angle(B, A, C) is angle at A between B and C, so that's angle BAC). Similarly, angle BAC is 33, angle BCA is 28.5? Wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, the Angle(C, B, A) is the angle at B between C and A, so that's angle ABC. So, angle ABC is 28.5 degrees. Then, angle BCA (at C) is the angle between B and A, but according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)) is 28.5. Wait, that's angle at C between B and A, so angle BCA is 28.5 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC has angles at A: 33°, at B: 28.5°, and at C: ?

Wait, sum of angles in triangle ABC should be 180. So, 33 + 28.5 + angle at C = 180. So angle at C would be 180 - 33 - 28.5 = 118.5 degrees. But wait, how does this relate to triangle AEC?

Wait, maybe triangle AEC is another triangle here. Let me see. The points involved are A, E, C. Also, there's a line AE, EC, CA forming triangle AEC. Also, point P is the incenter of triangle AEC. Additionally, there are other points like B, D, F, P connected via various lines and angles.

Also, there are several right angles mentioned. For example, RightAngle(Angle(A,B,P)), meaning that angle ABP is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(B,D,P)), so angle BDP is right. Also, RightAngle(Angle(C,E,P)) meaning angle CEP is right. And RightAngle(Angle(D,F,P)), so angle DFP is right.

Moreover, there are perpendicular lines: Line BP is perpendicular to AC, Line DP is perpendicular to AE, Line EP is perpendicular to CE. Also, Line DF is perpendicular to EF.

Additionally, there are some length measures: LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 10.9, LengthOf(Line(A,F)) is 13, LengthOf(Line(F,E)) is 14.9. These might be useful if we need to compute distances or use Pythagoras.

But perhaps focusing on angles first. Since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, the angles at P would relate to the angle bisectors. However, we need angle DEP. So, point D is connected to F and P via line DF and DP, and E is connected to P via line EP.

Let me think about the structure. Maybe I need to find coordinates of points to calculate the angle? Or find relations between angles using the given information.

Alternatively, since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, maybe we can find the angles of triangle AEC first, then use the angle bisectors.

Wait, let's consider triangle AEC. Its angles at A, E, C. Let me see if we can find those angles.

But how? Well, perhaps through other parts of the diagram. Let me look for more clues.

We know that Point B is connected to A and C, forming triangle ABC with angles as discussed earlier. Also, point F is connected to A and E, and line FE is connected to P and D. Hmm.

Also, there's a line AF with length 13, FE with length 14.9. Also, line AE is part of triangle AEC. Wait, but maybe triangle AFE?

Alternatively, considering that line AP bisects angle EAC, which is angle at A between E and C. So, since P is the incenter, AP is the bisector of angle EAC. Similarly, EP bisects angle AEC (angle at E between A and C), and CP bisects angle ACE (angle at C between A and E).

Therefore, if I can find the measures of angles at A, E, and C in triangle AEC, then I can find the angles created by the bisectors, which may help in determining angle DEP.

But how do I find the angles of triangle AEC? Let's think.

Perhaps triangle AEC is connected to triangle ABC somehow? Because points A, B, C are present, and E is another point. Wait, line AE is present, so E is connected to A and C. Also, line BE? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that certain lines are perpendicular. For example, Line BP is perpendicular to AC. Since P is the incenter, and BP is perpendicular to AC, implying that BP is the altitude? Wait, but in a triangle, the incenter lies at the intersection of angle bisectors, not necessarily altitudes unless the triangle is equilateral or something. However, here, they specifically mention that Line BP is perpendicular to AC, so that gives us a right angle at P between BP and AC.

Similarly, Line DP is perpendicular to AE, and Line EP is perpendicular to CE. So, these lines are altitudes? Wait, no, because P is the incenter, but in general, the incenter isn't necessarily where altitudes meet. However, the perpendicularity conditions here suggest that BP, DP, EP are perpendicular to certain lines, which could imply that P is the orthocenter? But no, since P is the incenter. This seems conflicting. Unless the triangle AEC is such that its incenter coincides with the orthocenter, which is only true for equilateral triangles, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the given predicates. It says:

Perpendicular(Line(B, P), Line(A, C)): So, BP ⊥ AC.

Perpendicular(Line(D, P), Line(A, E)): DP ⊥ AE.

Perpendicular(Line(E, P), Line(C, E)): EP ⊥ CE.

Wait, the third one is EP ⊥ CE. Wait, CE is the same as EC. So, Line EP is perpendicular to EC. Which means that EP is perpendicular to EC. So, that suggests that in triangle ECP, EP is the altitude from P to EC? Or maybe that line EP is perpendicular to EC, making angle at P between E and C being 90 degrees. Wait, but P is the incenter, so how can EP be perpendicular to EC? That would mean that the incenter lies such that EP is an altitude of triangle E... Wait, maybe triangle EPC?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle AEC has some specific properties. Let me try to find the angles of triangle AEC.

To find angles of triangle AEC, maybe we can use other given info. For example, angles involving point B.

Earlier, in triangle ABC, angles were:

At A: angle BAC = 33°, at B: angle ABC = 28.5°, at C: angle BCA = 28.5°, which sums to 33+28.5+28.5= 90°? Wait, no. Wait 33 + 28.5 + 28.5 equals 90? No, 33 + 28.5 is 61.5 plus 28.5 is 90. Oh! Wait, that adds up to 90 degrees? That can't be right, because the sum of angles in a triangle should be 180. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, did I misread the angles?

Wait, let me check again. The given predicates state:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, C)), 33)

Which is angle at A between B and C, i.e., angle BAC = 33°

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)), 33)

That's angle at A between C and B, which is the same as angle BAC? Wait, no. Wait, the notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So, Angle(C, A, B) is angle at A between C and B, which is the same as angle BAC. So that's redundant? Or maybe there's a typo? Wait, but then the next two:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), 28.5)

Which is angle at B between C and A, so angle ABC = 28.5°

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)), 28.5)

Which is angle at C between B and A, so angle BCA = 28.5°

So adding up, angles at A: 33°, at B: 28.5°, at C: 28.5°, total 33+28.5+28.5 = 90°, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be. There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe I got the notation wrong. Let me double-check the angle notation. In standard terms, Angle(X, Y, Z) represents the angle at vertex Y between points X and Z. So, for example, Angle(B, A, C) is the angle at point A between segments AB and AC. Similarly, Angle(C, A, B) is the angle at A between CA and AB, which is the same as angle BAC. So these two are actually the same angle. So why are they both given as 33°? That suggests that angle BAC is 33°, and angle BAC again is 33°, which is redundant. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe there are different triangles involved. Wait, but the problem mentions triangle ABC, but also triangle AEC. Wait, but the initial part says "P is the incenter of triangle AEC." So perhaps triangle ABC is separate from triangle AEC?

Wait, but then how are points B and C connected? Let me try to visualize. Points A, E, C form triangle AEC. Points B, D, F are other points. Line AE exists, as well as line EC and CA. Then, Line AB connects A to B, and BC connects B to C. So point B is outside triangle AEC? Or inside?

Given that, and the angles mentioned, maybe triangle ABC is a separate triangle, and triangle AEC is another triangle with some overlapping elements.

But the problem arises with the angles of triangle ABC adding up to 90° instead of 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, let me check again. Are there four angles listed? Let me recount the given angle measures:

- MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, C)) = 33 → angle BAC = 33°
- MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)) = 33 → angle BAC again? So that's redundant?
- MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) = 28.5 → angle ABC = 28.5°
- MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)) = 28.5 → angle BCA = 28.5°

So yes, angles of triangle ABC are 33°, 28.5°, and 28.5°, totaling 90°, which is impossible. This must mean I made a mistake in interpreting the angle notation. Alternatively, maybe the angles are not all in triangle ABC, but some are in other triangles.

Wait, for example, Angle(B, C, A) is angle at C between B and A, so that's angle BCA, which is part of triangle ABC. So that's still leading to the same conclusion. Therefore, either the problem has an error, or I'm misinterpreting the angle notation.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these angles are external or involve other triangles. Wait, for example, angle BAC is part of triangle ABC, angle ABC is also part of triangle ABC, and angle BCA is also part of triangle ABC. So if all three add up to 90°, that's impossible. Hence, there's an inconsistency here. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or maybe the angles are not all in the same triangle?

Wait, maybe some of these angles are not in triangle ABC but in another triangle. For example, maybe Angle(C, B, A) refers to a different configuration. Wait, but the notation is consistent. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all in the same triangle. For example, maybe Angle(C, B, A) refers to a different triangle. Wait, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the problem involves multiple triangles, and some of the angles are in triangle ABC, others in triangle AEC, etc.

This inconsistency suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem setup. However, assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps I need to proceed differently. Maybe the angles given are not all in triangle ABC, but some are in other triangles.

For example, Angle(C, B, A) might refer to triangle CBA, which is the same as triangle ABC. Still, the angles don't add up. Alternatively, maybe there's a different configuration. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the angles given are not all internal angles of triangle ABC. For example, Angle(C, B, A) could be an exterior angle? Or maybe it's referring to a different triangle. Wait, but the problem states that P is the incenter of triangle AEC. So, maybe the angles given are related to triangle AEC and other triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles mentioned are not all part of triangle ABC. Let me try to focus on triangle AEC, since P is its incenter. To find the angles of triangle AEC, I need to find angles at A, E, and C. Once I have those, since P is the incenter, I can find the angle bisectors and possibly relate them to other parts of the diagram.

But how to find the angles of triangle AEC?

Looking back, there are several right angles and perpendicular lines. For example, BP is perpendicular to AC, which implies that BP is an altitude from B to AC. Similarly, DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE.

Wait, if EP is perpendicular to CE, then in triangle CEP, EP is an altitude. Since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, if EP is perpendicular to CE, that suggests that the angle bisector of angle at E (in triangle AEC) is perpendicular to CE. That would imply that angle at E is 90°, because the angle bisector being perpendicular to the side implies that the angle itself is 90°. Because if you have a triangle with an angle θ, and its bisector is perpendicular to the opposite side, then θ must be 90°. Let me verify this.

Suppose in triangle XYZ, the angle bisector of angle X is perpendicular to side YZ. Then, angle X is divided into two equal angles, and the bisector is perpendicular to YZ. Let’s denote the angle bisector as XW, meeting YZ at W. Since XW is perpendicular to YZ, then angle XWY is 90°. Also, since XW is the angle bisector, angle YXW = angle WXZ = θ/2. But in triangle XYW, the angles are angle at X: θ/2, angle at W: 90°, so angle at Y is 180 - θ/2 - 90 = 90 - θ/2. Similarly for triangle XZW. However, unless θ is 90°, this doesn't directly give us anything. Wait, but if angle X is split into two equal parts, and the angle bisector is perpendicular to the opposite side, then the triangle must have some specific properties.

Alternatively, if the angle bisector is perpendicular to the opposite side, then the triangle is a right triangle. For example, suppose angle X is 90°, then its bisector divides it into 45° angles. If the bisector is perpendicular to the opposite side, then the triangle might satisfy certain conditions. However, this requires deeper analysis.

But in our case, EP is perpendicular to CE. So, in triangle AEC, the angle bisector of angle at E (which is line EP) is perpendicular to CE. This suggests that the angle at E is 90°, because the angle bisector being perpendicular to CE would mean that the angle is 90°, since the bisector would make 45° with each adjacent side, but if it's perpendicular to CE, then...

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose in triangle AEC, angle at E is θ, and EP is the angle bisector of angle E. If EP is perpendicular to CE, then the angle between EP and CE is 90°. But EP is the angle bisector, so it splits angle E into two equal angles. The angle between EP and CE would be half of angle E. Wait, no. The angle bisector of angle E would be a line starting at E and splitting angle E into two equal parts. If this bisector is perpendicular to CE, then the angle between the bisector and CE is 90°, which would mean that the angle between the bisector and CE is 90°, implying that angle E is 2*90° = 180°, which is impossible. So this suggests a contradiction, which indicates that there's an error in my understanding.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting which lines are perpendicular. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(E, P), Line(C, E)). Line(E, P) is the line from E to P, and Line(C, E) is the line from C to E. So, the line EP is perpendicular to line CE. Wait, line CE is the same as line EC. So line EP is perpendicular to line EC. So, at point E, line EP is perpendicular to line EC. But line EP is the angle bisector of angle at E (since P is the incenter). So, if the angle bisector of angle E is perpendicular to EC, which is one of the sides of the triangle. That would mean that the angle between the angle bisector and EC is 90°, which would imply that the angle at E is twice that, so 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect.

Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's predicates? Or perhaps I need to reinterpret the perpendicularity condition. Let me read the original predicate again:

Perpendicular(Line(E, P), Line(C, E)).

So, line EP is perpendicular to line CE. But line CE is part of triangle AEC. So, if EP is perpendicular to CE, then at point E, line EP forms a right angle with CE. But since EP is the angle bisector of angle at E in triangle AEC, this implies that the angle between EP and CE is half of angle E. Wait, no. The angle bisector of angle E would divide angle E into two equal parts. If EP is the angle bisector, then the angle between EP and EC is half of angle E. But if EP is perpendicular to EC, then the angle between EP and EC is 90°, which would mean that half of angle E is 90°, so angle E is 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the line EP is not the angle bisector? But the predicate says BisectsAngle(Line(E, P), Angle(A, E, C)), which means that line EP bisects angle AEC. So, angle AEC is split into two equal parts by line EP. So, if EP is the angle bisector of angle AEC, and it is also perpendicular to EC, then that implies that angle AEC is 90°, because the angle bisector being perpendicular to one of the sides would require the angle to be 90°. Let me explain:

If angle at E is θ, and the angle bisector EP is perpendicular to EC (one of the sides forming angle E), then the angle between EP and EC is 90°. But since EP is the angle bisector, it splits angle E into two equal parts. Let's imagine angle E is between sides EA and EC. The angle bisector EP would go from E, dividing angle E into two angles of θ/2. Now, if EP is perpendicular to EC, then the angle between EP and EC is 90°, which would mean that one of the angles formed by the bisector is 90°, but since it's the bisector, the other angle would also be 90°, making the total angle at E equal to 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a contradiction, indicating a mistake in the problem setup.

However, since this is a problem posed for solving, I must assume that there's no mistake, and I need to find a way around this. Perhaps the perpendicularity is not between EP and EC, but between EP and another line? Let me check the predicate again:

Perpendicular(Line(E, P), Line(C, E)).

Yes, that's what it says. Line(E, P) is EP, and Line(C, E) is CE. So, they are perpendicular. This suggests that in triangle AEC, the angle bisector at E is perpendicular to side EC. This seems contradictory, but perhaps there's a special case where this happens. For example, if angle E is 90°, then the angle bisector would split it into 45°, but if the angle bisector is perpendicular to EC, then the angle between EP and EC is 90°, which would require that the angle between EP and EC is 45°, which contradicts. So this seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle bisector is not EP, but another line? Wait, no, the predicate says BisectsAngle(Line(E, P), Angle(A, E, C)), which means line EP bisects angle AEC. So, this must be correct.

Given this contradiction, I might need to proceed by assuming that angle E in triangle AEC is 90°, even though the logic seems off, and see where it leads.

Assuming angle E is 90°, then angle AEC is 90°, and the angle bisector EP would split it into 45° each. Now, if EP is perpendicular to EC, then the angle between EP and EC is 90°, which would mean that the angle between EP and EC is 90°, but since it's the angle bisector, it should be 45°, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the line EP is not the angle bisector but something else? No, the predicate explicitly states that it is.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, but since I need to solve it, perhaps I should look elsewhere for information.

Let me try to consider the other given information. For example, the lengths of AF = 13, FE = 14.9, and AB = 10.9. Maybe these can help in calculating coordinates.

Alternatively, since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, the distance from P to each side is equal. Also, since there are right angles mentioned, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates to the points. Let's place point A at (0,0), and point C at (c,0), since line AC is horizontal. Let's say point E is somewhere in the plane. Given that there are perpendicular lines, perhaps we can set up coordinates accordingly.

But this might take time. Let me try.

Let me assume coordinates:

Let me place point A at (0,0), point C at (c,0), and point E at (d,e). Then, line AE goes from (0,0) to (d,e), line EC goes from (d,e) to (c,0), and line CA goes from (c,0) to (0,0).

Now, P is the incenter of triangle AEC. The incenter can be found as the intersection of angle bisectors. Also, there are several perpendicular lines mentioned: BP ⊥ AC, DP ⊥ AE, EP ⊥ CE.

Let me consider the coordinates of P. Since BP is perpendicular to AC. Since AC is horizontal (from (0,0) to (c,0)), then BP is vertical. So, BP is vertical, meaning that point P has the same x-coordinate as point B. Wait, but I don't know where B is located. Let me try to find coordinates for B.

Point B is connected to A and C via lines AB and BC. Earlier, in triangle ABC, angles at A and C were given. But earlier confusion about angles led to inconsistencies. Let me try to ignore that for now and focus on the perpendicularity conditions.

Since BP is perpendicular to AC, and AC is horizontal, BP is vertical. So, if I can find coordinates for B and P, such that BP is vertical. Let me assume that point B has coordinates (b_x, b_y), and since BP is vertical, P must have the same x-coordinate as B. Let me denote P as (b_x, p_y).

Similarly, DP is perpendicular to AE. Let me find equation for AE. If A is (0,0) and E is (d,e), then line AE has slope e/d. Therefore, line DP, which is perpendicular to AE, has slope -d/e.

Point D is connected to F and P via line DF, and line DF is perpendicular to EF. Also, there's a right angle at DFP, so angle DFP is 90°, which means that DF is perpendicular to FP. Wait, but the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(D, F), Line(E, F)), so DF ⊥ EF. So, line DF is perpendicular to line EF.

This is getting complicated. Maybe assigning coordinates would help, but it requires knowing many variables. Let me try to proceed step by step.

Let me first assume specific coordinates for simplicity. Let me choose coordinates such that AC is on the x-axis, with A at (0,0) and C at (k,0) for some k. Let me assume k=10.9 for simplicity, since AB is given as 10.9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can choose values that fit the given lengths.

Alternatively, since AF = 13 and FE = 14.9, maybe points A, F, E are colinear with AF = 13 and FE = 14.9. So, if I place A at (0,0), F at (13,0), and E at (13 + 14.9, 0) = (27.9, 0). But then line AE would be from (0,0) to (27.9,0), making it horizontal. But then line EC would connect E (27.9,0) to C, which is another point. But this might complicate things. However, let me try.

Let me assume that line AE is along the x-axis, with A at (0,0), F at (13,0), and E at (13 + 14.9, 0) = (27.9, 0). So, point E is at (27.9, 0). Then, point C is somewhere else. But how to find coordinates for C?

Also, there's a line from A to B, with length AB = 10.9. Let me assume that point B is somewhere in the plane. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, and there are several perpendicular lines, perhaps I can use the fact that the incenter has coordinates determined by the formula involving the sides.

But without knowing the lengths of the sides of triangle AEC, this might not be helpful. However, there are some lengths given: AF = 13, FE = 14.9, and AB = 10.9. Maybe these are related to triangle AFE?

Wait, point F is connected to A and E, with AF = 13 and FE = 14.9. So, triangle AFE has sides AF = 13, FE = 14.9, and AE = AF + FE = 13 + 14.9 = 27.9. So, AE = 27.9 units. If I assume that line AE is straight, then AE is 27.9 units long.

Now, since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, and line EP is perpendicular to CE (as per the predicate). Let me think about triangle AEC. If I can find the lengths of its sides, I can find its angles.

But how? Let me think about the relationship between triangle AEC and other parts.

Point B is connected to A and C, with AB = 10.9. Also, there's a right angle at B between BP and AC, so BP ⊥ AC. This suggests that BP is the altitude from B to AC. If I can find coordinates for B, it might help.

Let me try to set up coordinates with A at (0,0), C at (c,0), and E at (e_x, e_y). Then, line AE is from (0,0) to (e_x, e_y). Point F is on line AE such that AF = 13 and FE = 14.9, so AE = AF + FE = 27.9. Thus, the coordinates of F can be determined if I know the direction of AE.

Let me parameterize line AE. Let me assume that vector AE has length 27.9, so if I place A at (0,0), and E at (27.9, 0), then F would be at (13, 0). But then line AE is along the x-axis, and F is at (13, 0). However, this would make line EF from (13,0) to (27.9,0), which is along the x-axis. But then line DF is perpendicular to EF, which is horizontal, so DF would be vertical. Also, line DF is part of the diagram, connecting D to F, and since DF is perpendicular to EF, which is horizontal, DF is vertical. So, point D is somewhere along the vertical line passing through F.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should try to find the angles in triangle AEC.

Since P is the incenter, and there are several perpendicular lines, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the inradius r can be calculated, and the distances from P to the sides are equal. But without knowing the sides, it's difficult.

Alternatively, since there are right angles at P, maybe I can use right triangles to find relations.

For example, since BP ⊥ AC, and P is the incenter, then BP is the distance from P to AC, which is the inradius. Similarly, DP ⊥ AE, so DP is the inradius to side AE, and EP ⊥ CE, so EP is the inradius to side CE.

Wait, but in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. So, if BP is perpendicular to AC, then BP is the inradius r. Similarly, DP is perpendicular to AE, so DP is r, and EP is perpendicular to CE, so EP is r. Hence, BP = DP = EP = r.

But how does this help? Let me consider triangle AEC. If I can find the lengths of its sides, I can find the inradius r = area / semiperimeter.

But how to find the sides?

Let me think about triangle AFE. Since AF = 13, FE = 14.9, and AE = 27.9. But how is this related to triangle AEC? Point C is connected to E and A. If I can find the position of C, but I don't have enough information.

Alternatively, since there's a line from B to C, with AB = 10.9, and angle at A (BAC) is 33°, as given. Let me try to use trigonometry on triangle ABC.

Wait, earlier confusion about the angles in triangle ABC was due to adding up to 90°, which is impossible. But let's assume that there's a typo, and one of the angles is different. For example, perhaps MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) is 28.5, and MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)) is 28.5, making the angles at B and C as 28.5° each, and at A as 33°, totaling 33 + 28.5 + 28.5 = 90°, which is impossible. So this suggests that there's an error in the problem.

But since I need to solve it, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the angles given are correct, and there's a different interpretation. Maybe some of the angles are not in triangle ABC but in other triangles.

For example, Angle(C, B, A) could be an external angle, or part of another triangle. Let me try to think of it as part of triangle BCE or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all in triangle ABC, but some are in triangle AEC. For example, Angle(C, B, A) might be an angle in triangle CBA, which is the same as triangle ABC, but this brings us back to the same issue.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I should focus on the incenter P and the given perpendicularities.

Since P is the incenter of triangle AEC, and EP is perpendicular to CE, which suggests that in triangle AEC, the incenter lies such that the angle bisector of angle E is perpendicular to CE. As previously discussed, this would imply that angle E is 90°, despite the contradictions. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Assume angle E (angle AEC) is 90°. Then, the angle bisector EP divides it into two 45° angles. Since EP is perpendicular to CE, this would mean that the angle between EP and CE is 90°, which would imply that the angle between EP and CE is 45°, which is a contradiction. However, if angle E is 90°, and EP is the angle bisector, then the angle between EP and CE is 45°, but the predicate says it is 90°, which is still a contradiction.

This suggests that there's no solution under normal geometric assumptions, which implies that there must be an error in the problem or my interpretation. Given that, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me consider the possibility that angle DEP is formed by points D, E, P, and try to express it in terms of other angles.

Given that DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE, and there are other right angles. Let me think about quadrilaterals or other figures.

Since DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE, and P is the incenter, maybe there are rectangles or right triangles involved.

Alternatively, since DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE, then points D, P, and E form a right angle at P? No, because DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE. Unless AE and CE are perpendicular, which would make DP and EP both perpendicular to AE and CE respectively, but not necessarily forming a right angle at P.

Alternatively, since EP is perpendicular to CE, and DP is perpendicular to AE, then the lines DP and EP are perpendicular to AE and CE, respectively. If AE and CE are not perpendicular, then DP and EP are not parallel, and the angle between them would depend on the angle between AE and CE.

But angle between AE and CE is angle at E, which is part of triangle AEC. If I can find that angle, then I can find the angle between DP and EP.

But how?

Wait, let's consider the quadrilateral formed by D, P, E, and another point. Or maybe triangle DEP. To find angle DEP, I need to find the angle at E between D and P.

Since DP is perpendicular to AE, and EP is perpendicular to CE, then the angle between DP and EP would be equal to the angle between AE and CE, because they are both perpendicular to those lines. Wait, no. If two lines are perpendicular to two other lines, the angle between them is equal to the angle between the original lines. For example, if line 1 is perpendicular to line 3, and line 2 is perpendicular to line 4, then the angle between line 1 and line 2 is equal to the angle between line 3 and line 4.

So, since DP ⊥ AE and EP ⊥ CE, then the angle between DP and EP is equal to the angle between AE and CE, which is angle AEC. But angle AEC is part of triangle AEC, whose measure we need to find.

But if angle AEC is θ, then angle DEP is equal to θ. Wait, is that correct?

Let me think. If DP is perpendicular to AE, then DP is a line from D to P, perpendicular to AE. EP is perpendicular to CE, so it's a line from E to P, perpendicular to CE. So, the angle between DP and EP is equal to the angle between AE and CE, which is angle AEC. Therefore, angle DEP is equal to angle AEC. But wait, no. Because angle DEP is at point E, between D and P. So, if I can find the angle between DP and EP, which is angle DEP, it would be equal to the angle between AE and CE, which is angle AEC. But angle AEC is part of triangle AEC, and if we can find its measure, then we can find angle DEP.

But how to find angle AEC?

Let me return to the earlier idea that angle AEC is 90°, even though it led to contradictions. If angle AEC is 90°, then angle DEP would also be 90°, which is not among the answer choices (choices are 28.5, 30, 31, 33). So that can't be.

Alternatively, let's try to find angle AEC using other information. Let's consider triangle AEC and the given lengths.

We know AF = 13, FE = 14.9, so AE = 27.9. If we can find other sides of triangle AEC, we can use the Law of Cosines or Sines to find the angles.

But how to find other sides?

Let me think about the other given lengths. AB = 10.9. If I can relate AB to the sides of triangle AEC.

Point B is connected to A and C, and BP is perpendicular to AC. Let me consider triangle ABC, where AB = 10.9, and angles at A and B are 33° and 28.5°, respectively. Even though the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 90°, which is impossible, let's proceed with the calculation.

Using the Law of Sines on triangle ABC:

AB / sin(angle at C) = BC / sin(angle at A) = AC / sin(angle at B)

But angle at A is 33°, angle at B is 28.5°, angle at C is 28.5°, as given. So:

AB / sin(28.5°) = BC / sin(33°) = AC / sin(28.5°)

From this, AB / sin(28.5°) = AC / sin(28.5°), so AB = AC. Therefore, AC = AB = 10.9.

But then, in triangle ABC, AC = AB = 10.9, making it an isosceles triangle with base BC. Angles at B and C are equal (28.5° each), and angle at A is 33°. But this would mean that the sum of angles is 33 + 28.5 + 28.5 = 90°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there is an error in the problem, but assuming it's correct, perhaps the given angles are not all in triangle ABC.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are for different triangles. For example, angle BAC is 33°, angle ABC is 28.5°, and angle BCA is 28.5°, but these are not all in the same triangle. Maybe some are in triangle ABC, others in triangle AEC.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are part of triangle AEC. For example, angle at A (BAC) is 33°, which is part of triangle ABC, and angle at C (BCA) is 28.5°, which is part of triangle ABC, and angle at B (ABC) is 28.5°, which is part of triangle ABC. But this again leads to the same contradiction.

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent without resolving the angle sum issue, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that there's a typo and one of the angles is different. For example, maybe MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) is 28.5, and MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)) is 33, making the angles in triangle ABC sum to 33 + 28.5 + 33 = 94.5°, which is still not 180°, but closer. Or perhaps one of the angles is 180 - 33 - 28.5 = 118.5°, which would make sense.

Let me assume that there was a mistake in the given angles, and that MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) is 118.5°, making the angles in triangle ABC: 33°, 28.5°, and 118.5°, which sum to 180°. This would resolve the inconsistency. Let me proceed with this assumption.

So, in triangle ABC, angle at A (BAC) = 33°, angle at B (ABC) = 28.5°, angle at C (BCA) = 118.5°. This makes sense.

Now, with this, I can find the lengths of sides using the Law of Sines.

Let me denote AB = c = 10.9, BC = a, AC = b.

Using the Law of Sines:

a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)

Where A is angle at A (33°), B is angle at B (28.5°), C is angle at C (118.5°).

So,

a / sin(33°) = b / sin(28.5°) = 10.9 / sin(118.5°)

Calculate sin(118.5°): 118.5° is in the second quadrant, so sin(118.5°) = sin(180° - 61.5°) = sin(61.5°) ≈ 0.8793.

Thus, 10.9 / 0.8793 ≈ 12.4.

So, b = AC = (sin(28.5°) / sin(118.5°)) * 10.9 ≈ (0.4771 / 0.8793) * 10.9 ≈ 0.543 *
