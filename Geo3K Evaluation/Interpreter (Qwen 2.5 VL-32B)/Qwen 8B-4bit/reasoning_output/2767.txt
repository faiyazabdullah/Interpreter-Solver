MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, and some lines and arcs. The main thing here is the InscribedAngle predicate: Angle(C,E,B) is inscribed over Arc(C,D). Hmm. Let me recall what inscribed angles mean. 

An inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Wait, so if there's an inscribed angle at point E, intercepting arc CD, then the measure of angle CEB should be half the measure of arc CD. But wait, the problem says that Angle(C,E,B) is inscribed over Arc(C,D). So angle at E, with points C and B on the arc? Or maybe I need to visualize this better.

Let me sketch mentally. Points C, D connected by an arc. Then, the inscribed angle would be formed by two chords intersecting at E. So angle CEB intercepts arc CD. Therefore, the measure of angle CEB is half the measure of arc CD. But how does that relate to other elements?

Wait, but where is point E located? There's a line CE and EB. So E is connected to C and B. Also, there's an arc from C to D. Maybe the arc CD is part of a circle passing through these points. Let me think about the structure.

Given the lines: AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral? Because connecting A to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. So ABCD is a quadrilateral. Then there's another line CE and EB, connecting C to E and E to B. And there's an arc from A to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. Wait, those arcs probably belong to the same circle, since they're mentioned as arcs. So the entire quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle? That would make it a cyclic quadrilateral. Because all four vertices lie on a circle. So ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Now, the inscribed angle at E, angle CEB, intercepting arc CD. Since ABCD is cyclic, the opposite angles of the quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees. But how does point E come into play here?

Wait, E is connected to C and B. So E is a point outside or inside the circle? If E is on the circle, then maybe... Wait, the arc CD is part of the circle. If E is also on the circle, then angle CEB would be an inscribed angle. Alternatively, if E is inside the circle, then the angle could be different. But the problem states that the angle CEB is inscribed over arc CD. So perhaps E lies on the circumference of the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe E is a point such that CE and BE are chords. Let me consider that. Suppose ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, and E is another point on the circle. So, connecting C to E and E to B. Now, angle CEB intercepts arc CD. Wait, but angle CEB is formed by points C-E-B. So the intercepted arc would be arc CB that doesn't contain E? Or arc CD?

Wait, the intercepted arc for an inscribed angle is the arc that's opposite the angle. So angle at E, with sides EC and EB, intercepts arc from C to B that doesn't pass through E. But the problem says it's intercepting arc CD. So that suggests that arc CD is the intercepted arc. Therefore, maybe the arc CD is actually the arc that's opposite angle CEB. Wait, that seems conflicting unless there's something else going on.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Let me re-examine the given predicates. The arc mentioned is Arc(C,D). So the arc from C to D. So angle CEB intercepts arc CD. How can that happen? For angle at E, the intercepted arc is CD. So the angle is formed by two chords: EC and EB. So chord EC connects E to C, and EB connects E to B. Therefore, the intercepted arc would be the arc CD that's not containing E. Wait, but if E is somewhere else on the circle, then the intercepted arc would depend on the position of E.

Wait, maybe E is on the circle. Let's assume that. So ABCD is cyclic, and E is another point on the circle. Then angle CEB intercepts arc CD. Let me think about how that works. If E is positioned such that when you connect E to C and E to B, the angle at E intercepts arc CD. So, the arc CD must be the arc that's opposite to angle CEB. 

But in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle CEB is θ, then arc CD measures 2θ. However, without knowing the actual measure of the angle or the arc, how do we find x?

Wait, the question asks for the value of x. But where is x defined? Oh, wait, the problem didn't mention x explicitly. Wait, maybe x refers to the measure of angle CEB? Or maybe there's more information missing here. Wait, looking back at the original problem statement, the user hasn't specified what x represents. Wait, that's confusing. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the problem was cut off, or maybe x is referring to an angle or arc measure mentioned elsewhere. Wait, the user's question just says "Find the value of x." Without any prior definition of x. This is unclear. Wait, maybe in the original problem, there was a diagram or more details. But based on the given predicates, perhaps x is referring to the measure of angle CEB, which is inscribed over arc CD. 

Assuming that x is the measure of angle CEB, then according to the inscribed angle theorem, angle CEB = ½ * measure of arc CD. But we don't know the measure of arc CD. Unless there's more information. Let me check the other predicates again. Are there any other arcs or angles given?

We have arcs AB, BC, CD, DA. So those arcs are parts of the circle. Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the measures of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA equals 360 degrees. But without knowing individual arcs, how can we proceed?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. For example, if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But angle CEB isn't necessarily one of the angles of the quadrilateral. However, maybe angle CEB relates to other angles.

Alternatively, considering triangle CEB. If we can find other angles or sides, but we don't have length info. Wait, but maybe using other arcs. For instance, arc CD is intercepted by angle CEB. Suppose we can express arc CD in terms of other arcs. Let me think.

If ABCD is cyclic, then arc AB + arc CD equals arc BC + arc DA? No, that's not necessarily true. Wait, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°. If we can find relations between arcs, but without more data, it's hard. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. If angle CEB is an inscribed angle over arc CD, then arc CD = 2x. But if we can find arc CD in another way. For example, if arc AB is known, or other arcs. However, none of the given predicates provide numerical values for arcs or angles. So maybe there's missing information?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the inscribed angle. Maybe the angle is not directly over arc CD but over another arc. Wait, the problem says "InscribedAngle(Angle(C,E,B), Arc(C,D))". So the angle at E, between points C and B, intercepts arc CD. Which implies that arc CD is the arc that's opposite to angle CEB. 

So if we can find the measure of arc CD, then angle CEB is half of that. But how to find arc CD? Let me think about the rest of the structure. 

Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, and we have arcs AB, BC, CD, DA. Suppose we denote the measure of arc AB as α, arc BC as β, arc CD as γ, and arc DA as δ. Then α + β + γ + δ = 360°. 

Additionally, angle at E intercepts arc CD, so angle CEB = γ / 2. 

But without knowing the values of α, β, γ, or δ, how can we proceed? Is there another relation?

Wait, maybe there's another inscribed angle or something else. For example, if points A, B, C, D are on the circle, then angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC. Wait, but that depends on where E is. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. For example, triangle CED or something else. But without more info, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe there's an assumption that ABCD is a square or rectangle, but there's no indication of that. 

Alternatively, since there are lines CE and EB, forming triangle CEB. Maybe there's a relationship between other angles. 

Wait, if I assume that arc AB is equal to arc CD, or something like that. But again, no info. 

This is perplexing. Perhaps the problem expects knowledge that in certain configurations, the intercepted arc is determined by other arcs. For example, if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then the measure of angle ABC is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC, so angle ABC = (arc ADC - arc ADC)/2? Wait, no. The formula is angle ABC = ½(arc ADC - arc AC). Wait, I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a right angle involved. For example, if angle CEB is a right angle, then arc CD would be 180°, making angle CEB 90°, but none of the options are 90. 

Looking at the answer choices: 65, 132, 163, 180. These numbers suggest that maybe angle CEB is 65°, which would make arc CD 130°, or something like that. But without more data, I'm stuck. 

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me think again. The problem gives arcs AB, BC, CD, DA. So those arcs are part of the circle. If angle CEB intercepts arc CD, then angle CEB = ½ arc CD. But if I can find arc CD via other means. 

Suppose that ABCD is a trapezoid or something. For example, if AB is parallel to CD, then arcs AB and CD would have some relationship. But again, no info. 

Wait, maybe the fact that there's a line CE and EB. Let me think about triangle CEB. If I can find other angles in this triangle. For example, angle at C or B. 

But again, without knowing any angles or side lengths, this seems impossible. 

Is there any chance that the measure of arc CD is 2 times angle CEB, and if angle CEB is one of the answer choices, then arc CD would be double that. But how does that help us? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I'm missing. Like, if E is the intersection of diagonals or something. For example, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the product of the segments of intersecting chords. But that involves lengths, not angles. 

Hmm. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I need to look for another approach. Wait, the answer choices are 65, 132, 163, 180. Let me think: 180 is a straight angle. If angle CEB were 180°, then the points C, E, B would be colinear, but that would mean E is on the line CB, but then the inscribed angle would be undefined. So 180 is likely not. 

What about 132? If angle CEB is 132°, then arc CD would be 264°, which is possible. But why? 

Alternatively, maybe there's an external angle. Wait, if E is outside the circle, then the angle CEB would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if E is outside the circle, then angle CEB = ½(arc CB - arc CD). But the problem says it's an inscribed angle, implying E is on the circle. 

Wait, the term "inscribed angle" usually refers to an angle whose vertex is on the circle. So E must be on the circle. Thus, angle CEB intercepts arc CD, which would mean that arc CD is the arc that doesn't contain E. So, if arc CD is, say, 130°, then angle CEB is 65°, which is option A. 

But how do I get arc CD? If I can find other arcs. For example, if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, and we know that the sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360°. If we can find the measure of arc AB or others. 

Wait, but we don't have any explicit measures. However, maybe there's an implicit relationship. For example, if the arc AB is equal to arc CD, or something. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is related to arc ADC. For example, angle ABC = ½(arc ADC). But without knowing angle ABC, I can't proceed. 

Wait, maybe the answer relies on the fact that angle CEB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CD, and if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then arc CD is supplementary to arc AB. But again, without knowing arc AB, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a right angle. For example, if angle ABC is a right angle, then arc ADC would be 180°, but again, no info. 

I think I'm missing crucial information here. Since the problem gives certain arcs and lines, but no numerical measures, it's unclear how to compute x. Unless there's an implied configuration. 

Wait, maybe the arc CD is 130°, making angle CEB 65°, which is option A. But why 130°? Maybe because the other arcs add up to 230°, but that's pure guesswork. 

Alternatively, if ABCD is a rectangle, then all arcs would be 90° each, making arc CD 90°, and angle CEB would be 45°, which is not among the options. 

Wait, maybe ABCD is a kite? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that arc CD is twice angle CEB, and that angle CEB is 65°, leading to arc CD being 130°, hence x=65. But why 65? 

Without more information, I can't be certain. However, given the answer choices, and assuming that angle CEB is half of arc CD, and if arc CD is 130°, then x=65. Option A. 

Alternatively, if arc CD is 132°, then x=66, which isn't an option. Closest is 65. 

Or, if arc CD is 264°, then x=132, which is option B. 

Wait, but how to choose between A and B? 

Maybe there's another relationship. For example, if arc AB plus arc CD equals 180°, making angle CEB = ½(180° - arc AB). But again, no data. 

Alternatively, suppose that the total of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360°. If arc AB is equal to arc DA, and arc BC equal to arc CD. Let's say arc AB = arc DA = y, arc BC = arc CD = z. Then 2y + 2z = 360 → y + z = 180. Then angle CEB = ½*z. But still, without knowing z, can't determine. 

Alternatively, if arc CD is 132°, then angle CEB is 66°, close to option A. Or if arc CD is 264°, angle CEB is 132°, option B. 

Given that 132 is one of the options, and assuming that arc CD is twice angle CEB, but why would arc CD be 264? That would imply that the rest of the arcs add up to 96°, which may not be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving angle CEB. For example, if triangle CEB has angles adding to 180°. If angle CEB is x, and other angles are known. 

But without knowing any other angles, this is impossible. 

Hmm. This is very confusing. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should consider that the answer is 65 (option A), assuming that arc CD is 130°, hence angle CEB is 65°. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another property I missed. 

Wait, maybe the arc CD is a semicircle, making angle CEB 90°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, if the angle CEB is an exterior angle to the circle, but the problem states it's inscribed. 

Given the lack of concrete information, I'll take a guess that angle CEB is 65°, corresponding to arc CD of 130°, hence choosing option A.
