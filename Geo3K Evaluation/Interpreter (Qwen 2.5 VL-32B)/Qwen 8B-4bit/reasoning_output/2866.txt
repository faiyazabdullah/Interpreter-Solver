MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points and lines with some given angles and relationships. The question is asking for the measure of angle 13, given that angle 3 is 110 degrees and angle 12 is 55 degrees. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, I need to parse all the given information. There are several lines mentioned: AB, CD, EF, GH, IJ, KL. Then there are angles labeled 1 through 16. Some of these angles have measures specified, like angle 3 is 110° and angle 12 is 55°. Also, there are some right angles at angles 11 and 16. 

Looking at the relationships: Lines AB and CD are parallel. Similarly, lines EF and GH are parallel. They intersect with line KL at points L and K respectively. So line KL intersects AB and CD at point L, and EF and GH at point K. That suggests that KL is a transversal cutting through the two sets of parallel lines.

Now, looking at the angles. Corresponding angles and alternate interior angles are mentioned. For example, angle 3 corresponds to angle 7, and angle 3 has an alternate interior relationship with angle 5. Similarly, angle 12 corresponds to angle 15, and alternates with angle 10. 

Let me try to visualize this. Since AB || CD and EF || GH, and they're cut by transversal KL. So, point L is where KL meets AB and CD, and point K is where KL meets EF and GH. So KL is a straight line crossing these parallel lines. 

Given that angle 3 is 110°, which is likely one of the angles formed by the intersection of KL with the parallel lines AB and CD. But since AB and CD are parallel, the corresponding angles would be equal. Also, alternate interior angles would be equal. 

But wait, angle 3 is given as 110°, and it's stated that angle 3 and angle 7 are corresponding angles. So if angle 3 is 110°, then angle 7 should also be 110° because corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel. But maybe angle 3 is an angle formed by the transversal KL with one of the parallel lines? Wait, but KL intersects AB and CD at point L. So angle 3 could be at the intersection of KL and AB or CD. However, without knowing exactly where angle 3 is located, perhaps we need to consider the relationships given.

Also, angle 3 has an alternate interior relationship with angle 5. Alternate interior angles are equal when two lines are cut by a transversal. So if angle 3 is on one side of the transversal, angle 5 would be on the other side inside the parallel lines. Therefore, angle 5 equals angle 3, so angle 5 is also 110°. 

Then angle 12 is 55°, which is half of 110°, so maybe it's supplementary or something. Let's think about how angle 12 relates. It's stated that angle 12 corresponds to angle 15, so those are equal. And angle 12 is an alternate interior angle with angle 10. So angle 10 would be equal to angle 12, making angle 10 55°. 

But how does this relate to angle 13? The question is about angle 13. Maybe angle 13 is part of a triangle or another set of lines where we can use the sum of angles or vertical angles?

Wait, considering the diagram, since lines AB || CD and EF || GH, and KL is a transversal. Let me sketch mentally. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 3 is 110°, then its consecutive interior angle would be 70°, since 180 - 110 = 70. But angle 3 and angle 5 are alternate interior angles, so angle 5 is 110°, and the consecutive interior angle would be 70°, which might be another angle here. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 13 is adjacent to angle 12? Or perhaps it's part of a triangle involving angles we've already found. Let me check the given angles again. Angles 11 and 16 are right angles. So maybe some right angles are involved. 

Another thought: since angle 12 is 55°, and it's an alternate interior angle with angle 10, then angle 10 is 55°. Also, angle 12 corresponds to angle 15, so angle 15 is 55°. Now, if we look at the transversal KL intersecting the parallel lines EF and GH, then angle 12 and angle 15 are corresponding angles. 

Now, angle 13—what's its position? Without seeing the diagram, it's tricky, but perhaps angle 13 is related to the angles around point K or L. For instance, if KL intersects EF and GH, forming angles there. Alternatively, angle 13 could be a vertical angle or supplementary to another angle. 

Wait, maybe angle 13 is part of a triangle where other angles are known. Let me think about the structure. Since lines AB and CD are parallel, and KL intersects them at L, creating angles. Similarly, EF and GH are parallel, intersected by KL at K. 

Suppose angle 3 is at the intersection of KL and AB. Since AB || CD, angle 3 and angle 5 (alternate interior) are both 110°. Then, at point L, the angles around that point would add up to 360°. But angle 3 is 110°, so the adjacent angle would be 70°, because 180-110=70. Wait, but maybe that's another angle. 

Similarly, at point K, where KL intersects EF and GH. Suppose angle 12 is one of those angles. Since angle 12 is 55°, which is an alternate interior angle with angle 10. So angle 10 is 55°, which may be adjacent to angle 12. 

But how does angle 13 come into play? Perhaps angle 13 is vertically opposite to angle 12 or something? Or maybe it's a remote exterior angle. 

Alternatively, considering that angles 11 and 16 are right angles. So angle 11 is 90°, angle 16 is 90°. These might form parts of right triangles or influence the other angles. 

Wait, maybe angle 13 is part of a triangle where we know two angles and can find the third. For example, suppose there's a triangle involving angles 12, 13, and another angle. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since angle 3 is 110°, and angle 12 is 55°, which is half of that, maybe there's a relationship where angle 13 is supplementary to angle 12 or something. 

Wait, if angle 3 is 110°, then the consecutive interior angle (same-side interior) would be 70°, because they add up to 180. So if angle 3 is 110°, then the angle next to it along the line KL would be 70°. Maybe that's angle 13? Or another angle. 

Alternatively, since angle 12 is 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe angle 13 is 180 - 55 - something. 

Alternatively, let's consider that angle 13 could be an alternate exterior angle. If angle 3 is 110°, then the alternate exterior angle would be equal to it, but that might not directly relate. 

Wait, maybe angle 13 is a vertical angle with angle 5 or angle 7. Since angle 3 and angle 7 are corresponding angles, and angle 3 is 110°, then angle 7 is 110°, making angle 5 also 110° due to being alternate interior. 

But if angle 5 is 110°, then the adjacent angle to it would be 70°, which could be angle 13? 

Alternatively, considering the transversal KL intersecting the parallel lines EF and GH. At point K, angle 12 is 55°, which is an alternate interior angle with angle 10. So angle 10 is 55°, and angle 12 is 55°. Then, the vertical angles at point K would be 55°, and the supplementary angles would be 180-55=125°. 

Wait, if angle 12 is 55°, then the angle adjacent to it along line KL would be 180-55=125°, which might be angle 13? 

But how do we know? Without the exact diagram, it's challenging, but given the options, let's see. The answer choices are 55, 65, 70, 110. Given that angle 12 is 55°, and angle 3 is 110°, perhaps angle 13 is 70°, which is 180-110, or 180-55=125, but 125 isn't an option. Wait, but maybe angle 13 is 70°, which is half of 140, but not sure. 

Wait, if angle 3 is 110°, then the consecutive interior angle (on the same side) would be 70°, so that's 180-110=70. If angle 13 is that 70°, then answer C. But why would angle 13 be that? Maybe because it's the same as the consecutive interior angle. 

Alternatively, angle 13 could be a vertical angle to angle 12, which is 55°, but that would make it 55°, which is option A. But that seems too straightforward. 

Wait, let's go back. Since angle 3 and angle 5 are alternate interior angles, so angle 5 is 110°, and angle 3 is 110°. Then, the angles adjacent to angle 5 would be 70°, because 180-110=70. If angle 13 is that 70°, then answer C. 

Alternatively, if angle 12 is 55°, then the consecutive interior angle would be 180-55=125°, but that's not an option. Unless there's another relation. 

Wait, angle 12 and angle 10 are alternate interior angles, so angle 10 is 55°. Then, if angle 10 and angle 12 are both 55°, and if they are on different transversals, maybe angle 13 is part of a triangle with those angles. 

Alternatively, since angles 11 and 16 are right angles, maybe angle 13 is part of a right triangle. For example, if angle 13 is complementary to angle 12, then 90-55=35, which isn't an option. 

Hmm. This is confusing without the diagram. But given the answer choices and the information, the most plausible is that angle 13 is either 70° or 65°. 

Wait, if angle 3 is 110°, then the consecutive interior angle (which would be supplementary) is 70°, which could be angle 13. So that would make answer C. 

Alternatively, angle 12 is 55°, and if angle 13 is vertical to angle 12, then it's 55°, but that's option A. But since angle 12 is an alternate interior angle with angle 10, and angle 10 is 55°, maybe angle 13 is supplementary to angle 10, giving 180-55=125, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe angle 13 is the supplement of angle 3, which is 70°, so answer C. That seems more likely. Because angle 3 is 110°, and if angle 13 is adjacent to it, then 180-110=70. Hence, answer C. 

So I think the correct answer is C, 70°.
