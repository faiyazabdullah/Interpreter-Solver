Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have several points: P, R, Q, S, T. There are triangles mentioned: Triangle(P,R,Q), Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(R,S,T). Also, some lines like Line(P,R), Line(R,Q), Line(P,Q), etc. Then there are angles: Angle(P,R,Q), Angle(P,S,T), Angle(R,S,T). Some right angles: RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) and RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)). Also, some right triangles: Right(Triangle(P,R,Q)), Right(Triangle(P,S,T)), Right(Triangle(R,S,T)). 

Measurements: Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), 10), Equals(LengthOf(Line(S,Q)), 5), Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Q)), 25). And SumOf(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,Q)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)))). Wait, that sum seems to indicate that RS + SQ = RQ? So maybe that's a way to find RQ?

Also, Similar(Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(P,R,Q)). So these two triangles are similar. That should mean corresponding sides are proportional. 

The question is asking for PT. Hmm. So we need to find the length of PT. Let me try to visualize or sketch the diagram based on the given info.

First, since there are multiple right triangles, maybe we can use Pythagoras. Let me note down the given lengths. RS is 10 units, SQ is 5 units. Since RS + SQ equals RQ (from the sum predicate), then RQ would be 10 + 5 = 15. Wait, but that's assuming the sum of RS and SQ equals RQ. But how do we know that? The predicate says SumOf(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,Q)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)))). So that means RS + SQ = RQ. Therefore, RQ is 15 units long.

Now, looking at the triangles. Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle. Which angle is the right angle? The Right(Triangle(P,R,Q)) predicate suggests it's a right triangle. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) and RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)). Wait, Angle(P,R,S) being a right angle implies that in triangle PRS, angle at R is right? Or wait, the angle notation: Angle(P,R,S) means the angle at point R between points P and S. So if that's a right angle, then triangle PRS has a right angle at R. Similarly, Angle(P,S,T) is a right angle, so triangle PST has a right angle at S.

But also, Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle. Let me check where the right angle is. Since there's a RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) which is part of triangle PRS, but Triangle(P,R,Q) is another triangle. Maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is at R? Because if we consider the right angle in that triangle, perhaps angle at R?

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is at Q? Wait, but the right angle could be anywhere. However, given that there's a RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)), which is part of triangle PRS, which may be connected to other elements.

Let me think about the similar triangles. It says Similar(Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(P,R,Q)). So triangle PST ~ triangle PRQ. Since they're similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion. Let me denote the correspondence. The order matters here. Triangle(P,S,T) corresponds to Triangle(P,R,Q), so vertex P corresponds to P, S corresponds to R, and T corresponds to Q. Therefore, the similarity ratio is PS/PR = PT/PQ = ST/RQ. 

Wait, but we need to confirm the correspondence. If Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q), then the order of vertices should correspond. So angle at P in PST corresponds to angle at P in PRQ. So the sides opposite those angles would be proportional. Alternatively, the sides adjacent to P would be PS and PQ in their respective triangles. Wait, maybe I need to write down the ratios properly.

In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. So:

PS / PR = PT / PQ = ST / RQ.

So if I can find the lengths of these sides, I can set up proportions.

We already know RQ is 15, since RS + SQ = 15. Also, we know that SQ is 5. Let me see if I can find other lengths.

Looking at Triangle(P,R,Q): it's a right triangle. Let me assume that the right angle is at R because of the RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) which is in triangle PRS. Wait, but Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle. If angle at R is the right angle, then PR and RQ would be legs, and PQ hypotenuse. But we know PQ is 25. Wait, earlier we had that PQ is 25? Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Q)), 25). Yes, PQ is 25. So if Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle with legs PR and RQ, then by Pythagoras:

PR² + RQ² = PQ².

But we know RQ is 15, PQ is 25. So:

PR² + 15² = 25² → PR² = 625 - 225 = 400 → PR = 20.

So PR is 20 units. Now, in triangle PRS, which has a right angle at R (since RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S))), then PR and RS are legs, and PS is the hypotenuse. So PR is 20, RS is 10, so PS would be sqrt(20² + 10²) = sqrt(400 + 100) = sqrt(500) = 10√5. So PS is 10√5.

Now, going back to the similar triangles. Triangle PST ~ Triangle PRQ. From the correspondence above, the sides PS corresponds to PR, PT corresponds to PQ, and ST corresponds to RQ. Wait, let me make sure. If Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q), then the correspondence is P→P, S→R, T→Q. Therefore:

Side PS corresponds to side PR,

Side PT corresponds to side PQ,

Side ST corresponds to side RQ.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is PS / PR = PT / PQ = ST / RQ.

We know PS is 10√5, PR is 20. So the ratio is (10√5)/20 = √5/2. Therefore, PT / PQ = √5/2. Since PQ is 25, then PT = (√5/2)*25 = (25√5)/2. Wait, but that doesn't seem to match any of the options. The answer choices are numerical values, not involving radicals. So maybe my assumption about the correspondence is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. For example, maybe the similarity is such that angle P is common, but the other angles correspond differently. Let me re-examine the similar triangles.

Triangle PST and Triangle PRQ are similar. Let me check their angles. Since Triangle PST has a right angle at S (because RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T))). Triangle PRQ has a right angle at R (as per the earlier assumption). So the right angles are at S and R respectively. Therefore, the similarity would require that the right angles correspond. Hence, angle at S in PST corresponds to angle at R in PRQ. Thus, the correspondence would be:

PST ~ PRQ with right angles at S and R. Therefore, the correspondence is:

P corresponds to P,

S corresponds to R,

T corresponds to Q.

Thus, same as before. So the sides opposite the right angles would be PT and PR? Wait, no. In triangle PST, the right angle is at S, so the hypotenuse is PT. In triangle PRQ, the right angle is at R, so the hypotenuse is PQ. Therefore, the hypotenuses correspond. So the ratio would be PT / PQ = PS / PR.

Wait, that's different. Because in similar triangles, the hypotenuse of one corresponds to the hypotenuse of the other. So if the right angles are at S and R, then the hypotenuse of PST is PT (opposite the right angle at S), and the hypotenuse of PRQ is PQ (opposite the right angle at R). Therefore, the ratio of similarity is PT / PQ = PS / PR.

Earlier, we found PS is 10√5, PR is 20. So PT / 25 = (10√5)/20 → PT = 25*(√5)/2. Again, same result, which isn't among the answer choices. So something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption about where the right angles are located is incorrect.

Wait, let's double-check where the right angles are. The given RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) refers to angle at R between P and S. So in triangle PRS, angle at R is right. So PR is perpendicular to RS. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)) means in triangle PST, angle at S is right. So PS is perpendicular to ST. 

But Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle. Where is its right angle? The right angle could be at R, Q, or P. But since there's a RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) which involves point R, maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is at R? Let me check again.

If Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle, and if the right angle is at R, then PR and RQ are legs, and PQ is hypotenuse. We had that earlier, leading to PR=20, RQ=15, PQ=25, which fits the Pythagorean triple 15-20-25 (which is a multiple of 3-4-5). So that seems correct.

Then, for the similar triangles, Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q). Let's think about their angles. Triangle PST has a right angle at S, as per the given. Triangle PRQ has a right angle at R. Therefore, the right angles correspond, so the similarity ratio is based on the sides around the right angles.

For Triangle PST: right angle at S. The legs are PS and ST, hypotenuse PT.

For Triangle PRQ: right angle at R. The legs are PR and RQ, hypotenuse PQ.

Since they are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. So the ratio of leg1 to leg2 in PST over leg1 to leg2 in PRQ.

But which sides correspond? Since the right angles are at S and R, the legs adjacent to those right angles would be the ones that correspond.

In Triangle PST: legs are PS and ST.

In Triangle PRQ: legs are PR and RQ.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be PS/PR = ST/RQ = PT/PQ.

We have PS = 10√5 (calculated earlier), PR = 20. So PS/PR = (10√5)/20 = √5/2. Therefore, PT/PQ = √5/2. Since PQ is 25, PT = 25*(√5)/2 ≈ 25*2.236/2 ≈ 28. So that's not matching any answer choices either. But none of the options involve square roots. This suggests that my assumptions are wrong somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is not at R. Let's reconsider. Suppose the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is at Q. Then, the legs would be PQ and QR, and hypotenuse PR. Wait, but that would conflict with previous calculations. Let's try that.

If Triangle(P,R,Q) is right-angled at Q, then PQ and QR are legs, and PR is hypotenuse. Given PQ is 25, QR is RQ which we thought was 15. Then PR would be sqrt(25² + 15²) = sqrt(625 + 225) = sqrt(850) ≈ 29.15. But earlier, we had from the sum of RS + SQ = RQ = 15, which led us to RQ being 15. But if PR is not 20, then our calculation for PS would change. However, this contradicts the earlier conclusion that PR is 20 if the right angle is at R. So this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q) is at P? Then legs would be PR and PQ, and hypotenuse RQ. Wait, but then RQ would be hypotenuse. But earlier, we had RQ as 15. Then PR^2 + PQ^2 = RQ^2 → PR^2 + 25^2 = 15^2 → PR^2 = 225 - 625 = negative, impossible. So that can't be. So the right angle must be at R, making PR and RQ legs, and PQ hypotenuse. So PR = 20, RQ = 15, PQ = 25. That still holds.

So returning to the similar triangles. If the ratio is PS / PR = ST / RQ = PT / PQ. We have PS as sqrt(PR^2 + RS^2) = sqrt(20² + 10²) = sqrt(500) = 10√5. So PS = 10√5. Then PS / PR = (10√5)/20 = √5/2. So PT = PQ * (√5/2) = 25*(√5)/2. But this isn't an option. The answer choices are rational numbers. So maybe my mistake is in identifying which sides correspond in the similar triangles.

Perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me think again. The triangles are Triangle(P,S,T) and Triangle(P,R,Q). If they are similar, the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So P corresponds to P, S corresponds to R, T corresponds to Q. So the sides PS corresponds to PR, ST corresponds to RQ, and PT corresponds to PQ. So the ratio is PS / PR = ST / RQ = PT / PQ.

We have PS = 10√5, PR = 20. So ratio is 10√5 / 20 = √5/2. Then ST / RQ = same ratio. ST is a side in triangle PST. What is ST? Well, triangle PST has a right angle at S. So ST is one of the legs. Let me compute ST. 

In triangle PST, right-angled at S, so ST and SP are legs, PT is hypotenuse. We know SP is 10√5, and we can find ST if we know PT. But without knowing ST, this seems stuck. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. 

Wait, there's another right triangle: Triangle(P,S,T) is right-angled at S. Also, we have Point S connected to Q via Line(S,Q) with length 5. Is there a relationship between ST and SQ? Maybe ST is related to SQ through some other triangle or proportion.

Alternatively, since Triangle(P,S,T) is similar to Triangle(P,R,Q), and we know some sides. Let me think again about the ratio. If PS / PR = ST / RQ, then ST = (PS / PR) * RQ. We know PS = 10√5, PR = 20, RQ = 15. So ST = (10√5 / 20) * 15 = (sqrt(5)/2) * 15 = (15√5)/2. Then, in triangle PST, which is right-angled at S, we have legs PS and ST, so PT^2 = PS^2 + ST^2.

So PT^2 = (10√5)^2 + [(15√5)/2]^2 = 500 + (225*5)/4 = 500 + 1125/4 = convert 500 to 2000/4, total is 2000/4 + 1125/4 = 3125/4. Therefore, PT = sqrt(3125/4) = (sqrt(3125))/2 = (25√5)/2. Same result as before. Still not matching the answer choices. So this suggests that my initial assumption about the correspondence is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the similar triangles have a different correspondence. Maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,S,T) corresponds to the right angle in Triangle(P,R,Q). Wait, Triangle(P,S,T) has right angle at S, and Triangle(P,R,Q) has right angle at R. So if they are similar, then the right angles must correspond. So the correspondence would be: angle at S (right) in PST corresponds to angle at R (right) in PRQ. Thus, the similarity would be PST ~ PRQ with the right angles at S and R respectively. Hence, the sides adjacent to the right angles would be the legs. 

So in Triangle PST: legs are PS and ST, hypotenuse PT.

In Triangle PRQ: legs are PR and RQ, hypotenuse PQ.

Thus, the ratio of similarity would be PS / PR = ST / RQ = PT / PQ.

We have PS = 10√5, PR = 20, RQ = 15. So:

PS / PR = (10√5)/20 = √5/2.

Therefore, ST = (RQ * √5)/2 = (15 * √5)/2. As before.

Then, PT = sqrt(PS^2 + ST^2) = sqrt((10√5)^2 + (15√5/2)^2).

Which gives PT = sqrt(500 + (225*5)/4) = sqrt(500 + 1125/4) = sqrt( (2000 + 1125)/4 ) = sqrt(3125/4) = (sqrt(3125))/2 = (25√5)/2. 

Still not matching the answer choices. So this suggests that maybe there's an error in calculating PS or PR. Let me check again.

Earlier, I assumed that in triangle PRS, which is right-angled at R, PR is 20, RS is 10. Then PS is sqrt(20² + 10²) = sqrt(500). But maybe this is incorrect. Let me verify.

From the given, Line(R,S) has length 10. Line(S,Q) has length 5. And the sum of RS and SQ equals RQ, so RQ = 15. So RQ is 15. Then, Triangle(P,R,Q) is a right triangle with legs PR and RQ (assuming right angle at R), giving PR² + RQ² = PQ². PQ is 25. So PR² + 15² = 25² → PR² = 625 - 225 = 400 → PR = 20. Correct.

So PR is indeed 20, RS is 10. So triangle PRS has PR=20, RS=10, right-angled at R. So PS is sqrt(20²+10²)=sqrt(500)=10√5. Correct.

So why isn't this working? The answer options are fractions, not involving radicals. Maybe there's another approach. Let me look at other parts of the problem.

There's also Triangle(R,S,T) which is a right triangle. Right(Triangle(R,S,T)). So Triangle(R,S,T) is right-angled. Which angle is the right angle? The given RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) is in triangle PRS, but not directly for RST. But since there's a Right(Triangle(R,S,T)), the right angle could be at S or T or R. Let me check if there's more info.

Line(S,T) is present, and Line(R,S) is given. Also, Line(S,Q) is 5. So maybe Triangle(R,S,T) is right-angled at S, since Line(R,S) and Line(S,T) meet at S. If that's the case, then Triangle(R,S,T) has a right angle at S. So RS and ST are legs, RT is hypotenuse.

Given that RS is 10, and ST is...? Well, if we can find ST, maybe from similar triangles or other relations.

But earlier, we had from the similar triangles that ST = (15√5)/2. But that leads to PT being (25√5)/2, which isn't among the options. So maybe there's another way. Let me think about the coordinates.

Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let me place point R at origin (0,0). Since Triangle(P,R,Q) is right-angled at R, let's say R is at (0,0). Then, since PR is 20 and RQ is 15, and assuming right angle at R, we can assign coordinates:

- R is (0,0)

- Since PR is 20, and assuming it goes along x-axis, P could be at (20,0).

- RQ is 15, so Q is at (0,15) if it's along y-axis.

Wait, but then PQ would be the distance between (20,0) and (0,15), which is sqrt(20² + 15²) = 25, which matches the given PQ=25. Perfect!

So coordinates:

- P: (20,0)

- R: (0,0)

- Q: (0,15)

Now, Line(R,S) has length 10. Since R is at (0,0), S is some point such that RS = 10. Also, Line(S,Q) has length 5. So S is a point such that distance from S to R is 10, and distance from S to Q is 5.

Let me find coordinates of S. Let me denote S as (x,y). Then:

Distance from R (0,0) to S(x,y): sqrt(x² + y²) = 10 → x² + y² = 100.

Distance from S(x,y) to Q(0,15): sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-15)^2) = 5 → x² + (y-15)^2 = 25.

Subtracting first equation from second:

[x² + (y-15)^2] - [x² + y²] = 25 - 100 → expand (y-15)^2 - y² = -75 → y² -30y + 225 - y² = -30y + 225 = -75 → -30y = -300 → y = 10.

So y=10. Plugging back into x² + y² = 100 → x² + 100 = 100 → x² = 0 → x=0. So S is at (0,10). 

Wait, that places S at (0,10), which is on the y-axis between R(0,0) and Q(0,15). So S is vertically aligned with R and Q. 

Now, with S at (0,10), we can find T. Let's recall that Triangle(P,S,T) is a right triangle with right angle at S (given RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T))). So in Triangle(P,S,T), right angle at S. So points P, S, T form a right triangle with right angle at S. 

Coordinates:

- P is (20,0)

- S is (0,10)

We need to find T such that Triangle(P,S,T) is right-angled at S. So vectors SP and ST are perpendicular.

Vector SP is P - S = (20-0, 0-10) = (20, -10).

Vector ST is T - S = (Tx - 0, Ty - 10) = (Tx, Ty - 10).

Their dot product should be zero:

SP • ST = 20*Tx + (-10)*(Ty - 10) = 0 → 20Tx -10Ty + 100 = 0 → Simplify: 2Tx - Ty + 10 = 0 → Ty = 2Tx + 10.

So T lies on the line Ty = 2Tx + 10.

Additionally, Triangle(P,S,T) is similar to Triangle(P,R,Q). Earlier, we determined that they are similar with ratio √5/2. But let's use coordinates to find T.

Since Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q). Let's find the coordinates of T.

First, let's recall Triangle(P,R,Q) has coordinates:

P(20,0), R(0,0), Q(0,15). This is a right triangle with legs PR=20, RQ=15, hypotenuse PQ=25.

Triangle(P,S,T) is similar to this triangle. So the similarity transformation maps PRQ to PST. 

To find T, we can use the similarity ratio. Since the similarity ratio is PS / PR = (distance from P to S) / PR.

Distance PS: from P(20,0) to S(0,10): sqrt((20)^2 + (10)^2) = sqrt(400 + 100) = sqrt(500) = 10√5.

PR is 20. So the ratio is (10√5)/20 = √5/2. So the similarity ratio is √5/2. Therefore, the coordinates of T can be determined by scaling the coordinates of Q relative to P.

Wait, in similar triangles, the correspondence is PST ~ PRQ. So the transformation from PRQ to PST would involve translating and scaling. But since P is common, maybe it's a homothety centered at P?

Let me think. Since P is a common vertex, the similarity transformation would map R to S and Q to T. So vector PR maps to vector PS, and vector PQ maps to vector PT.

Vector PR is R - P = (0-20, 0-0) = (-20, 0).

Vector PS is S - P = (0-20, 10-0) = (-20, 10).

So the transformation from PR to PS involves scaling and rotation? Wait, but similarity includes rotation and scaling. However, since the triangles are similar, the direction from P to R to S would be scaled and rotated.

Alternatively, since the similarity ratio is √5/2, and the direction from P to R is (-20, 0), then the vector from P to S is (-20,10). So the scaling factor from PR to PS is |PS| / |PR| = (10√5)/20 = √5/2. 

But to get from PR to PS, the vector PR is (-20, 0), and PS is (-20, 10). So this involves a rotation and scaling. However, since the triangles are similar, the angle between PR and PS should be equal to the angle between PR and PQ in the original triangle. 

Alternatively, since the similarity ratio is k = √5/2, then the vector from P to T should be k times the vector from P to Q, plus some adjustment. Wait, no. Since the similarity transforms PRQ to PST, mapping R to S and Q to T. 

So the transformation takes R to S and Q to T. So the transformation matrix would scale by k and rotate appropriately. But this might be complex.

Alternatively, since the similarity preserves angles, and the triangles share angle at P. So the angle at P in both triangles is the same. Let's calculate the angle at P in both triangles.

In Triangle PRQ: angle at P. Let's compute it. Using vectors PR and PQ.

Vector PR is (-20, 0), vector PQ is Q - P = (0-20, 15-0) = (-20, 15).

The angle at P between PR and PQ can be found using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (PR · PQ) / (|PR| |PQ|)

PR · PQ = (-20)(-20) + (0)(15) = 400 + 0 = 400.

|PR| = 20, |PQ| = 25.

So cos(theta) = 400/(20*25) = 400/500 = 4/5. So theta = arccos(4/5).

Similarly, in Triangle PST, the angle at P should be the same. Let's see. Vector PS is (-20,10), and vector PT is (Tx - 20, Ty - 0) = (Tx - 20, Ty).

The angle between PS and PT should also be arccos(4/5). So:

cos(theta) = (PS · PT) / (|PS| |PT|) = [(-20)(Tx - 20) + 10*Ty]/[|PS| |PT|] = 4/5.

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of using angles, use the similarity ratio.

Since the similarity ratio is k = |PS| / |PR| = (10√5)/20 = √5/2. So every length in PST is k times the corresponding length in PRQ.

So for example, the length PS corresponds to PR, and PT corresponds to PQ.

Wait, earlier we said that PS / PR = √5/2, so PT / PQ = √5/2. So PT = PQ * √5/2 = 25*(√5)/2. But this again gives the same result. 

However, since we have coordinates for S, maybe we can find T by finding a point such that Triangle PST is similar to PRQ, and then compute PT.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for S, and knowing that T lies on the line Ty = 2Tx + 10, we can find T such that PST ~ PRQ.

Let me attempt this. Let me denote T as (a, b), with b = 2a + 10.

Now, the triangle PST has vertices at P(20,0), S(0,10), T(a,b). This triangle is similar to PRQ, which has vertices at P(20,0), R(0,0), Q(0,15). 

Since the similarity is PST ~ PRQ, the order of the vertices must correspond. So the similarity sends P to P, S to R, T to Q. So the transformation maps S(0,10) to R(0,0), and T(a,b) to Q(0,15).

So the transformation is a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling. Let's find the transformation.

From S(0,10) to R(0,0): this is a translation down by 10 units. But also, since it's a similarity transformation, it might involve scaling and rotation. Let me consider the vectors.

Original vector from P to S: S - P = (0-20, 10-0) = (-20, 10).

Image vector from P to R: R - P = (0-20, 0-0) = (-20, 0).

So the transformation maps vector (-20,10) to (-20,0). This suggests a scaling and possibly rotation.

The length of vector PS is sqrt((-20)^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(500) = 10√5. The length of PR is 20. So the scaling factor is 20 / (10√5) = 2/√5 = 2√5/5. Wait, but earlier we said the similarity ratio was √5/2. This seems conflicting. 

Wait, if the transformation scales by k, then the length of PS (original) becomes length of PR (image). So k = |PR| / |PS| = 20 / (10√5) = 2/√5. So the scaling factor is 2/√5. 

So the transformation includes scaling by 2/√5, and possibly rotation. Let me find the rotation angle. 

The original vector PS is (-20, 10). After transformation, it becomes PR vector (-20, 0). To find the rotation angle θ such that rotating PS by θ gives PR.

The rotation matrix is [[cosθ, -sinθ], [sinθ, cosθ]].

Applying this to vector PS (-20, 10):

New x-coordinate: -20*cosθ - 10*sinθ = -20

New y-coordinate: 20*sinθ + 10*cosθ = 0

So we have two equations:

1. -20cosθ -10sinθ = -20 → 20cosθ + 10sinθ = 20

2. 20sinθ + 10cosθ = 0

From equation 2: 20sinθ = -10cosθ → tanθ = -10/20 = -1/2 → θ = arctan(-1/2). 

Let me compute sinθ and cosθ for θ = arctan(-1/2). Let's consider θ in the fourth quadrant (since tan is negative). Let's imagine a right triangle with opposite side -1, adjacent 2, hypotenuse sqrt(1 + 4) = √5. So sinθ = -1/√5, cosθ = 2/√5.

Plugging into equation 1: 20*(2/√5) + 10*(-1/√5) = (40/√5) - (10/√5) = 30/√5 = 6√5. But equation 1 requires it to be 20. So this is inconsistent. Hence, my assumption that the transformation is just scaling and rotation is missing something.

Alternatively, the transformation might include translation. Since S is mapped to R, which is a translation down by 10 units, but also scaled and rotated. This complicates things. Maybe it's easier to use the similarity condition directly.

Since Triangle PST ~ Triangle PRQ, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So PS/PR = PT/PQ = ST/RQ.

We have PS = 10√5, PR = 20, so PS/PR = √5/2. Therefore, PT/PQ = √5/2 → PT = 25*(√5)/2. But this is still the same result. 

But since the answer choices don't include this, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me check if there's another interpretation of the similar triangles.

Wait, the problem states Similar(Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(P,R,Q)). So the order is PST ~ PRQ. So the correspondence is P-P, S-R, T-Q. So the sides PS corresponds to PR, ST corresponds to RQ, and PT corresponds to PQ.

So PS/PR = ST/RQ = PT/PQ.

We know PS = 10√5, PR = 20, RQ = 15, PQ = 25.

So PS/PR = (10√5)/20 = √5/2. So ST/RQ = √5/2 → ST = (15 * √5)/2.

Now, in triangle PST, right-angled at S, so PT^2 = PS^2 + ST^2.

So PT^2 = (10√5)^2 + (15√5/2)^2 = 500 + (225*5)/4 = 500 + 1125/4 = (2000 + 1125)/4 = 3125/4 → PT = sqrt(3125)/2 = (25√5)/2. Still same result.

But this doesn't match the answer choices. Let me check the options again:

A. 6

B. 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

C. 7

D. 22/3 ≈ 7.333...

Hmm. None of these match (25√5)/2 ≈ 17.677... So this suggests that there's a miscalculation. Let me go back to the coordinate system.

With S at (0,10), and needing to find T such that PST ~ PRQ.

Let me try to find T such that the similarity holds. Let me use the fact that in similar triangles, corresponding angles are equal. So angle at P in PST is equal to angle at P in PRQ.

We calculated earlier that in PRQ, the angle at P is arccos(4/5). Let me calculate this angle numerically: cos(theta) = 4/5 → theta ≈ 36.87 degrees.

In triangle PST, the angle at P should also be this angle. Let's use vectors to find T.

Vector PS is S - P = (0-20, 10-0) = (-20, 10).

Vector PT is T - P = (a-20, b-0) = (a-20, b).

The angle between PS and PT should be equal to the angle between PR and PQ in PRQ.

The cosine of this angle is (PS · PT) / (|PS| |PT|) = [(-20)(a-20) + 10*b] / (10√5 * |PT|) = 4/5.

So:

[-20(a-20) + 10b] = (4/5) * 10√5 * |PT|

Simplify left side: -20a + 400 + 10b.

Right side: 8√5 * |PT|.

But |PT| is sqrt((a-20)^2 + b^2).

Also, since T lies on the line Ty = 2Tx + 10, so b = 2a + 10. Substituting:

Left side: -20a + 400 + 10*(2a + 10) = -20a + 400 + 20a + 100 = 500.

So 500 = 8√5 * |PT| → |PT| = 500 / (8√5) = (500)/(8√5) = (500√5)/(8*5) = (100√5)/8 = (25√5)/2. Which confirms our earlier result. So PT = 25√5/2, which is approximately 17.677. But this isn't among the options. 

This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I've misinterpreted the similar triangles. Let me recheck the similar triangles statement: Similar(Triangle(P,S,T), Triangle(P,R,Q)). Maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps it's Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,Q,R)? Or another order? Let me try reversing the order.

If Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,Q,R), then the correspondence is P-P, S-Q, T-R. So the ratio would be PS/PQ = ST/QR = PT/PR.

Let's try this. PS is 10√5, PQ is 25. So PS/PQ = (10√5)/25 = 2√5/5. Then ST/QR = same ratio. QR is 15. So ST = 15 * (2√5/5) = 6√5. Then, in triangle PST, right-angled at S, PT^2 = PS^2 + ST^2 = (10√5)^2 + (6√5)^2 = 500 + 180 = 680 → PT = sqrt(680) = 2√170 ≈ 26.08, still not matching options.

Another possibility: maybe the correspondence is P-S, S-R, T-Q? No, the similarity is between Triangle(P,S,T) and Triangle(P,R,Q). So the order must match.

Wait, maybe the right angle in Triangle(P,S,T) is at T, not at S? But the given predicate is RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)), which means the right angle is at S. So that's fixed.

At this point, I'm stuck because all paths lead to PT = (25√5)/2, which isn't among the options. Maybe there's a miscalculation in the given data? Let me check the sum predicate again: SumOf(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,Q)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)))). This means RS + SQ = RQ. So RS is 10, SQ is 5, so RQ is 15. Correct.

Is there a chance that the sum is meant to be RS + SQ = PQ? No, the predicate explicitly says SumOf(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,Q)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)))), which implies RS + SQ = RQ.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different convention for the sum predicate? Maybe it's RS + SQ = PQ? But the predicate says SumOf(..., Equals(...)), which likely means RS + SQ = RQ.

Assuming all given data is correct, and the answer choices are correct, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the similar triangles' correspondence. Let me try another approach.

Let me look at the answer choices. They are all rational numbers, suggesting that PT is a rational number. My current result is irrational. So there must be an error in my assumptions.

Let me revisit the similar triangles. Maybe the right triangles are not the ones I thought. For example, maybe Triangle(P,S,T) is not right-angled at S, but at T? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)), which is at S. 

Wait, let me recheck the given predicates: RightAngle(Angle(P,R,S)) and RightAngle(Angle(P,S,T)). So Angle(P,R,S) is at R, and Angle(P,S,T) is at S. So yes, right angles at R and S.

Now, let's consider Triangle(P,S,T). It is right-angled at S, and similar to Triangle(P,R,Q). Let me use the fact that in similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Let me denote the sides.

In Triangle(P,R,Q), which is right-angled at R, the legs are PR and RQ, hypotenuse PQ.

In Triangle(P,S,T), right-angled at S, legs are PS and ST, hypotenuse PT.

So similarity implies PS/PR = ST/RQ = PT/PQ.

We have PS = 10√5, PR = 20, RQ = 15, PQ = 25.

So PS/PR = (10√5)/20 = √5/2.

Thus, ST = (RQ * PS)/PR = (15 * 10√5)/20 = (150√5)/20 = (15√5)/2.

Then, PT = sqrt(PS^2 + ST^2) = sqrt((10√5)^2 + (15√5/2)^2) = sqrt(500 + (225*5)/4) = sqrt(500 + 1125/4) = sqrt(2000/4 + 1125/4) = sqrt(3125/4) = (sqrt(3125))/2 = (25√5)/2.

Again, same result. So this suggests that either the problem is flawed, or I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the given Right(Triangle(P,R,Q)) is not a right triangle at R, but at Q? Let me check. If Triangle(P,R,Q) is right-angled at Q, then the legs are PQ and QR, and hypotenuse PR. But PQ is 25, QR is 15, so PR would be sqrt(25² + 15²) = sqrt(850), which is not an integer. But earlier, we had PR as 20. This inconsistency suggests that the right angle must be at R.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at P? Then, PR and PQ would be legs, and RQ hypotenuse. But then PR^2 + PQ^2 = RQ^2 → 20² + 25² = RQ^2 → 400 + 625 = 1025 → RQ = sqrt(1025) ≈ 32, which conflicts with RQ = 15. So no.

Thus, the only consistent scenario is right angle at R. 

At this point, since all calculations consistently lead to PT
