MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what each means. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have points H, G, J, D. There are several lines mentioned: Line(H,G), Line(H,J), Line(G,J), and Line(H,D). Also, there are angles at point D involving points H, G, and J. Specifically, Angle(H,D,G) and Angle(H,D,J) are both right angles. Additionally, it says that Line(H,D) is an altitude of triangle H,G,J. 

Then there are some length equalities. The length of Line(H,G) is 7 units, Line(H,J) is 10 units. Then, the length of Line(G,D) is given as 2x - 2, and Line(D,J) is 2x + 4. Finally, there's a relationship that the length of Line(G,J) is equal to the sum of the lengths of Line(G,D) and Line(D,J).

The question asks for the value of GD, which is the length of Line(G,D), so we need to find x such that 2x - 2 equals GD, but first we need to find x using the other given equations.

Let me try to visualize the triangle. Since HD is an altitude, that means HD is perpendicular to the base GJ. Wait, but in a triangle, an altitude is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side. So if HD is an altitude of triangle HGJ, then H is connected to D, which lies on the opposite side GJ. Therefore, D must be a point on GJ such that HD is perpendicular to GJ. But wait, the angles at D are right angles: Angle(H,D,G) and Angle(H,D,J). That suggests that HD forms two right angles at D with DG and DJ? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation here.

Wait, the angles are Angle(H,D,G) and Angle(H,D,J). So, at point D, the angle between HD and DG is a right angle, and the angle between HD and DJ is also a right angle. But if HD is an altitude, then HD should be perpendicular to GJ. So, since D is on GJ, then HD is perpendicular to GJ. Therefore, angles at D between HD and DG, and HD and DJ would both be right angles. That makes sense because HD is perpendicular to GJ, making those two angles right angles. So, that confirms that HD is indeed an altitude.

Now, looking at the lengths. We know HG = 7, HJ = 10. Also, GD is 2x - 2, DJ is 2x + 4. And the total length of GJ is GD + DJ = (2x - 2) + (2x + 4) = 4x + 2. But also, since GJ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the altitude HD. Wait, but in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse has certain properties. However, here, triangle HGJ is a triangle with altitude HD. Wait, but since HD is an altitude, then triangle HGD and triangle HJD are both right triangles. Because HD is perpendicular to GJ, so triangles HGD and HJD are right-angled at D.

Therefore, triangle HGD is right-angled at D, and triangle HJD is also right-angled at D. So, in triangle HGD, we have legs HD and GD, and hypotenuse HG. Similarly, in triangle HJD, legs HD and JD, hypotenuse HJ. Wait, but HG is given as 7, HJ is 10. So, let's write down these Pythagorean relations.

For triangle HGD: HG² = GD² + HD² → 7² = (2x - 2)² + HD².

For triangle HJD: HJ² = JD² + HD² → 10² = (2x + 4)² + HD².

So, if we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:

HJ² - HG² = (JD² - GD²)

Which gives:

10² - 7² = [(2x + 4)^2] - [(2x - 2)^2]

Calculating left side: 100 - 49 = 51.

On the right side, expand both squares:

(2x+4)^2 = 4x² + 16x + 16

(2x-2)^2 = 4x² -8x +4

Subtracting them: (4x² +16x +16) - (4x² -8x +4) = 24x +12.

So, 24x +12 = 51.

Solving for x: 24x = 51 -12 = 39 → x = 39 /24 = 13/8 = 1.625.

Wait, but then GD is 2x -2. Plugging x=13/8:

GD = 2*(13/8) -2 = 13/4 - 8/4 = 5/4 = 1.25. But none of the answer choices are 1.25. This suggests something is wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption about which sides correspond to the hypotenuses is incorrect. Wait, maybe I mixed up the hypotenuse. Let me double-check.

In triangle HGD, right-angled at D, so the hypotenuse is HG. Correct. In triangle HJD, right-angled at D, hypotenuse is HJ. Correct. So the equations are correct.

But according to this calculation, x is 13/8, leading to GD being 5/4. Which isn't among the options. So where did I go wrong?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the altitude HD divides the triangle into two right triangles, but perhaps the entire triangle HGJ is not a right triangle? Wait, but the problem states that both angles at D are right angles. Wait, but how can there be two right angles at D? Unless D is not on GJ, but that contradicts the fact that HD is an altitude (which requires D to lie on GJ). So that seems conflicting.

Wait, hold on. The problem says that both Angle(H,D,G) and Angle(H,D,J) are right angles. That would mean that at point D, the lines DH, DG, and DJ form right angles. But if D is on GJ, then DG and DJ are segments along GJ. So, if HD is perpendicular to GJ, then angles at D between HD and DG, and HD and DJ are both right angles. But that would require that DG and DJ are colinear, which they are since D is on GJ. So that works. So the previous equations should still hold.

But getting x=13/8 leads to GD=5/4, which doesn't match any options. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me check the given equation for GJ. It says that the length of GJ is equal to the sum of GD and DJ. Which we already used. So GD + DJ = GJ. But also, since HD is an altitude, in a triangle, the length of the altitude can be found via area.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the altitude in terms of the legs of the right triangles. Let me think. Alternatively, since we have two expressions for HD² from the two Pythagorean equations.

From triangle HGD: HD² = 7² - GD² = 49 - (2x-2)^2.

From triangle HJD: HD² = 10² - JD² = 100 - (2x+4)^2.

Setting these equal:

49 - (2x-2)^2 = 100 - (2x+4)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: 49 - [4x² -8x +4] = 49 -4x² +8x -4 = 45 -4x² +8x.

Right side: 100 - [4x² +16x +16] = 100 -4x² -16x -16 = 84 -4x² -16x.

Set equal:

45 -4x² +8x = 84 -4x² -16x.

Cancel out -4x² from both sides:

45 +8x = 84 -16x.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

8x +16x = 84 -45 → 24x = 39 → x = 39/24 = 13/8, same as before.

This seems consistent. So GD is 2x -2 = 2*(13/8) -2 = 13/4 - 8/4 = 5/4. Still same result. But answer choices are integers. So either there's a mistake in my interpretation, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem mentions that Line(G,J) is equal to the sum of Line(G,D) and Line(D,J). So GJ = GD + DJ. Which we've used. But maybe there's another relation here. For example, since HD is an altitude, the product of the segments of the hypotenuse equals the square of the altitude. Wait, in a right triangle, if you draw an altitude to the hypotenuse, then (GD)(DJ) = HD². Wait, but is triangle HGJ a right triangle? Because if HD is an altitude, but unless HGJ itself is a right triangle. Wait, but in our case, the original triangle HGJ may not be a right triangle. Wait, but if HD is an altitude, but the angles at D are right angles. Wait, but earlier conclusion was that HD is perpendicular to GJ, making two right triangles. But does that imply that triangle HGJ is a right triangle? Not necessarily. Unless one of the angles at H, G, or J is a right angle. But the problem doesn't state that. So maybe that approach isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0), since HD is an altitude. Since HD is perpendicular to GJ, which lies along the x-axis. Let me assume that. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s consider D as (0,0). Since HD is an altitude, and it's perpendicular to GJ. Let me suppose that GJ is horizontal, so the line GJ is along the x-axis. Then HD is vertical, so point H has coordinates (0, h), since it's directly above D.

Points G and J are on the x-axis. Let me denote G as (a, 0) and J as (b, 0). Then, since D is between G and J, assuming that D is on GJ. Wait, but the problem says that Line(H,D) is an altitude, so D must be the foot of the altitude from H to GJ. Therefore, D is somewhere on GJ. So, the coordinates would be:

H is (0, h), D is (0,0), G is (g, 0), J is (j, 0). Wait, but then the distance from G to D is |g - 0| = |g|, and from D to J is |j - 0| = |j|. But the problem states that GD = 2x -2 and DJ = 2x +4. Assuming that G and J are on opposite sides of D, so that GJ = GD + DJ. So, for instance, if G is to the left of D and J is to the right, then coordinates could be G(-d, 0), D(0,0), J(e, 0), making GD = d and DJ = e. Then GJ = d + e.

But given that, the length of HG is the distance from H(0,h) to G(-d, 0): sqrt(d² + h²) = 7. Similarly, HJ is sqrt(e² + h²) = 10. Also, GD = d = 2x -2, DJ = e = 2x +4. So, we have:

sqrt(d² + h²) = 7 → d² + h² = 49.

sqrt(e² + h²) = 10 → e² + h² = 100.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives e² - d² = 51.

Also, since e = 2x +4 and d = 2x -2, substituting:

e = d + 6, since (2x +4) - (2x -2) = 6. So e = d +6.

Thus, e² - d² = (d+6)^2 - d^2 = 12d + 36 = 51.

So, 12d +36 =51 → 12d =15 → d =15/12 =5/4 = 1.25. Which is the same result as before. Hence, GD = d =5/4. Again, this is 1.25, which is not among the options. So there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the position of D. What if D is not between G and J? Suppose that D is extended beyond G or J. For example, if G and J are both on the same side of D. But then the length GJ would be |GJ| = |GD - DJ|, depending on the direction. But the problem states that GJ is equal to GD + DJ, implying that D is between G and J, hence GJ = GD + DJ. So that part seems correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the given that Line(G,J) is equal to Add(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,J))) is redundant because it's just the definition of GJ. But maybe there's more to it. Or perhaps there's another relationship I haven't considered.

Wait, the problem also mentions that both angles at D are right angles. So Angle(H,D,G) and Angle(H,D,J) are right angles. Which implies that HD is perpendicular to both DG and DJ, meaning that DG and DJ are in the same line, which they are since D is on GJ. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different configuration. Perhaps H is not above the line GJ but somewhere else. But given that HD is an altitude, it must be perpendicular to GJ. So regardless of the position, the coordinates setup holds.

Wait, but maybe the problem is referring to triangle H, G, J as having right angles at D, but in reality, the triangle is not a right triangle. So the altitude HD creates two right triangles, but the main triangle is not right-angled. However, even with that, the equations still lead us to GD = 5/4. Which conflicts with the answer choices.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the Pythagorean theorem. Let me recheck the equations.

For triangle HGD: HG² = GD² + HD² → 7² = GD² + HD².

For triangle HJD: HJ² = JD² + HD² → 10² = JD² + HD².

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

100 - 49 = JD² - GD² → 51 = JD² - GD².

But JD = 2x +4, GD = 2x -2. So JD² - GD² = (2x+4)^2 - (2x-2)^2.

Expanding:

(4x² +16x +16) - (4x² -8x +4) = 24x +12.

So 24x +12 =51 → 24x=39 → x=39/24=13/8.

So GD=2x-2=2*(13/8)-2=13/4 - 8/4=5/4=1.25. Same result.

But answer choices are integers. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I misunderstood the given data.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), 2x - 2)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)), 2x + 4)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Add(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,J))))"

Ah! Wait, the last equality says that the length of Line(G,J) is equal to the sum of Length(G,D) and Length(D,J). But in standard geometry, GJ is the length from G to J, which is GD + DJ if D is between G and J. So that's correct. So the equations are consistent.

But why does this lead to GD being 5/4? Is there a chance that the question is asking for something else? Like, maybe the value of x, instead of GD? But the question specifically asks for G D, which is the length of GD. Or perhaps the problem meant to say that the length of GJ is equal to GD + DJ, which it is, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in expanding the squares. Let me recompute:

(2x +4)^2 = 4x² + 16x +16.

(2x -2)^2 = 4x² -8x +4.

Difference: (4x² +16x +16) - (4x² -8x +4) = 4x² +16x +16 -4x² +8x -4 = 24x +12. Correct.

So 24x +12 =51 → x=(51-12)/24=39/24=13/8. Correct.

Then GD=2x-2=2*(13/8)-2=13/4 -8/4=5/4. So 5/4 is 1.25. None of the options are this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem expects integer solutions, so perhaps I made an error in interpreting the equations. Let me try plugging in the answer choices to see which one fits.

Suppose GD is one of the options: A.10, B.12, C.14, D.20.

Let me test each option.

Option A: GD =10. Then 2x -2=10 → 2x=12 → x=6. Then DJ=2x+4=16. So GJ=10+16=26. Now, check if the Pythagorean relations hold.

HG=7, HJ=10. For triangle HGD: HG²=7²=49. GD=10, so HD²=49 -10²=49-100=-51. Impossible. So invalid.

Option B: GD=12. Then 2x-2=12 → 2x=14 →x=7. Then DJ=2*7+4=18. GJ=12+18=30. Check HG²=49. HD²=49 -12²=49-144=-95. Invalid.

Option C: GD=14. Then 2x-2=14 →2x=16→x=8. DJ=2*8+4=20. GJ=14+20=34. HD²=49 -14²=49-196=-147. No good.

Option D: GD=20. 2x-2=20 →2x=22→x=11. DJ=2*11+4=26. GJ=20+26=46. HD²=49 -20²=49-400=-351. Still negative. All options give negative HD², which is impossible. So none of the answer choices work. This indicates a contradiction, suggesting that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that both angles at D are right angles. So maybe the triangles HGD and HJD are not right triangles? Wait, no, because HD is perpendicular to GJ, so they are right triangles. But then the equations should hold. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in three dimensions? Unlikely, as it's a plane geometry problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the given lengths. Let me check again:

The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,G)), 7). So HG=7, HJ=10. Then GD=2x-2, DJ=2x+4. And GJ=GJ. But if GJ is GD + DJ, then GJ= (2x-2)+(2x+4)=4x+2. But also, since HD is an altitude, maybe we can relate HD to the area of the triangle. The area of triangle HGJ can be expressed as (base * height)/2. Here, base is GJ, and height is HD. Also, the area can be computed using Heron's formula if we know all sides. But we don't know GJ yet, but GJ=4x+2. However, we don't know HD. But we also can compute the area using the two right triangles.

Area of triangle HGD plus area of triangle HJD equals area of triangle HGJ. Each right triangle has area (GD * HD)/2 and (DJ * HD)/2. So total area is (GD + DJ)*HD /2 = GJ * HD /2. Which checks out, since it's the same as the area using base GJ and height HD.

But without knowing HD, this doesn't help directly. Alternatively, using the two right triangles:

From triangle HGD: HD² = HG² - GD² = 49 - (2x-2)^2.

From triangle HJD: HD² = HJ² - DJ² = 100 - (2x+4)^2.

Setting equal: 49 - (2x-2)^2 = 100 - (2x+4)^2.

As before, leading to x=13/8, GD=5/4. 

This suggests that the problem might have a mistake in the answer choices, or perhaps I misread the problem. Another possibility: the question asks for GD, but maybe there's a different interpretation of the given predicates. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Wait, the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(H,D,G)) and RightAngle(Angle(H,D,J)). This means that at point D, the angles between HD and DG, and between HD and DJ are right angles. So, HD is perpendicular to both DG and DJ. But DG and DJ are parts of the same line GJ, so this implies that HD is perpendicular to GJ, which we already considered. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different type of altitude. But in standard definitions, an altitude is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side. So HD is the altitude from H to GJ, which means it's perpendicular to GJ. 

Another thought: maybe the problem refers to the triangle H, G, J as a right triangle, and HD is the altitude to the hypotenuse. In that case, we can use properties of right triangles. For example, in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse relates the segments of the hypotenuse. But in this case, if triangle HGJ were a right triangle, then the altitude HD would satisfy HD² = GD * DJ. Let me explore this possibility.

Assume that triangle HGJ is a right triangle. But which angle is the right angle? The problem doesn't specify, but since HD is an altitude, it could be any angle. Let me assume that the right angle is at G or J. Let's try both cases.

Case 1: Assume triangle HGJ is right-angled at G. Then, HG and GJ are legs, and HJ is the hypotenuse. But then the altitude from H to GJ would not be the same as the leg. Wait, if it's right-angled at G, then the altitude from H to GJ would be the same as the leg HG? No, because the altitude from H to GJ would be the same as the height from H to GJ, which in a right triangle at G would be the same as the leg HG. Wait, no, because if the triangle is right-angled at G, then the altitude from H to GJ would be the same as the leg HG. But in that case, D would coincide with G, making GD=0. Which doesn't fit the given equations.

Case 2: Assume triangle HGJ is right-angled at J. Similar issue. Altitude from H to GJ would be HJ, making DJ=0.

Alternatively, if the right angle is at H. Then, triangle HGJ is right-angled at H. Then, the altitude from H to GJ would be zero because H is already on the right angle. Doesn't make sense.

So, if triangle HGJ is not a right triangle, then the altitude HD is as previously discussed. But then, the equations still lead to GD=5/4. 

Given that none of the answer choices match, and assuming the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps there is a miscalculation. Let me try once more.

Let me calculate x=13/8. Then, GD=2x-2= 2*(13/8) - 2 = 13/4 - 8/4 = 5/4. Which is 1.25. If the problem had asked for x, it would be 13/8, but it asks for GD. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that the length of Line(G,D) is 2x + 2, and Line(D,J) is 2x - 4, or some other combination. Or perhaps the given lengths for GJ is different. Without further information, it's hard to say. Given that the answer choices are all integers, and my calculation results in 5/4, which is not an option, I might conclude that there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I missed a key insight.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is in a different configuration where GJ is not straight, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the altitude HD is not inside the triangle, but outside? Let me consider that scenario.

Suppose D is outside the segment GJ. For example, if G and J are on the same side of D, making GJ = |GD - DJ|. But the problem states that GJ is equal to GD + DJ, implying that D is between G and J. So this scenario is excluded.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses vector lengths or absolute values, but that wouldn't change the algebraic result.

At this point, since the calculations consistently lead to GD=5/4, and none of the answer choices match, I suspect there's either a typo in the problem or a misinterpretation. However, since I need to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the equations.

Wait, let me re-express the equations. From earlier:

We have e² - d² = 51, where e = 2x+4, d = 2x-2.

And e = d + 6. So, (d+6)^2 - d^2 = 51 → 12d +36 =51 → 12d=15 → d=15/12=5/4.

But maybe the problem assumes that x is an integer, and there's a rounding or different interpretation. For example, if the equations were supposed to be:

Maybe the lengths of GD and DJ are 2x-2 and 2x+4, but the problem actually meant that GJ = 2x-2 and DJ=2x+4, or some other mix-up. For instance, if GJ was meant to be 2x-2 and DJ=2x+4, then GJ = GD = 2x-2, and DJ=2x+4, but then GJ would not be GD + DJ. This is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Line(G,D) = 2x -2 and Line(D,J) = 2x +4, but the length of GJ is not GD + DJ. But the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Add(...)), so that should be GD + DJ.

Another possibility: the problem has a typo in the length of Line(H,G) or Line(H,J). If, for example, Line(H,G) was 14 instead of 7, or Line(H,J) was 15 instead of 10, then the calculations would yield integer values. But since I cannot change the given data, I have to work with what's provided.

Given that, and since none of the options match, I'm forced to conclude that either there's a mistake in the problem or perhaps the answer is not listed. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A-D, I must choose the closest possible. But since 5/4 is 1.25, and the closest option is none, but perhaps the problem intended a different setup.

Wait, let me consider if the altitude HD is not from H to GJ, but from D to another side. No, the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(H,D), Triangle(H,G,J)), meaning that Line(H,D) is an altitude of the triangle. So it must be from H to GJ.

Another idea: perhaps the problem uses the fact that in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the segments. But since we don't know if the triangle is right-angled, this might not apply.

Wait, but earlier, we have two expressions for HD²: 49 - (2x-2)^2 and 100 - (2x+4)^2. Setting them equal gives x=13/8. Let me compute HD² using this x.

HD² = 49 - (2x-2)^2 = 49 - (2*(13/8)-2)^2 = 49 - (13/4 - 8/4)^2 = 49 - (5/4)^2 = 49 - 25/16 = (784/16 - 25/16) = 759/16 ≈ 47.4375.

Similarly, from the other equation: HD² = 100 - (2x+4)^2 = 100 - (2*(13/8)+4)^2 = 100 - (13/4 + 16/4)^2 = 100 - (29/4)^2 = 100 - 841/16 = 1600/16 - 841/16 = 759/16. Consistent.

So HD is sqrt(759)/4 ≈ 27.55/4 ≈ 6.8875.

But this doesn't help with finding GD.

Since none of the answer choices match, and assuming the problem is correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.14, but I can't justify it. Alternatively, maybe I misread the given lengths. Let me check again:

The problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,G)), 7)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), 10)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), 2x - 2)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,J)), 2x + 4)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,J)), Add(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,J))))

Yes. So, if there's a miscalculation in the expansion, let me recheck:

Expand (2x+4)^2 - (2x-2)^2.

Using difference of squares: (a+b)(a-b) where a=2x, b=4 - (-2)? Wait, no. Let me do it as (2x+4)^2 - (2x-2)^2 = [ (2x+4) + (2x-2) ] * [ (2x+4) - (2x-2) ] = (4x +2) * (6) = 24x +12. Yes, correct.

So 24x +12 =51 → x=39/24=13/8.

No mistake here. Thus, the answer should be 5/4, but since it's not an option, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for x, not GD? If so, x=13/8, which is 1.625, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the value of x multiplied by something. But no, the question is to find G D, which is GD.

Given the constraints, and since none of the options match, I might have to reconsider the initial assumptions. Perhaps the right angles at D are not both present, but only one? But the problem explicitly states both angles are right angles.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D space, but that's unlikely.

At this point, given the time spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to proceed with the calculation that led to GD=5/4, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C.14, assuming a miscalculation. But this is pure speculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different setup where GD is 14, and there's a miscalculation in the process.

Wait, let me try assuming that the equation was meant to be e² + d² = 51, instead of e² - d² =51. If that were the case, then:

e² + d² =51.

With e = d +6.

So, (d+6)^2 + d^2 =51 → d² +12d +36 +d² =51 → 2d² +12d -15=0 → d = [-12 ± sqrt(144 +120)]/4 = [-12 ± sqrt(264)]/4. Still not rational.

No, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the equation was e² + d² = 51, but that's not supported by the problem.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and must conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but since I must choose, perhaps the closest is C.14, but this is uncertain. Alternatively, there might be a miscalculation I missed. 

Wait, let me try plugging x=5, which gives GD=2*5-2=8, DJ=2*5+4=14. GJ=22. Then, check if HG² = GD² + HD² and HJ² = DJ² + HD².

From HG=7: 7² = 8² + HD² → 49 =64 + HD² → HD² = -15. Impossible.

If x=3: GD=4, DJ=10. GJ=14. HD² =49 -16=33, and HD²=100 -100=0. Contradiction.

x=4: GD=6, DJ=12. HD²=49-36=13, HD²=100-144=-44. No.

x=2: GD=2, DJ=8. HD²=49-4=45, HD²=100-64=36. Not equal.

x=5/2=2.5: GD=2*(2.5)-2=3, DJ=2*2.5+4=9. HD²=49-9=40, HD²=100-81=19. Not equal.

x=3: GD=4, DJ=10. As before.

No luck. 

Perhaps the problem had a different length for HG or HJ. If, for example, HG was 14 and HJ was 10, then:

Let me assume HG=14, HJ=10. Then, repeating the process:

e² -d² = 100 - 196 = -96.

Wait, no, the subtraction would be HJ² - HG² = 100 - 196 = -96 = JD² - GD².

But JD = d +6, GD=d.

So (d+6)^2 -d^2 = 12d +36 = -96 → 12d = -132 → d=-11. Negative length, impossible.

Not helpful.

If HG=10 and HJ=14, then HJ² - HG²=196-100=96= e² -d²=12d +36=96 → 12d=60 →d=5. Then GD=5, which is option A:10? No, 5 isn't an option. But if GD=5, and DJ=5+6=11. Then, check HD²=10² -5²=75, and HD²=14² -11²=196-121=75. This works! So if HG=10 and HJ=14, then GD=5. But in the original problem, HG=7 and HJ=10. So if the problem had swapped the lengths, it would work. But since it's not, this suggests that there's a typo. 

Given that, and considering the answer choices, if the intended answer was 5, which is not an option, but if the problem had HG=10 and HJ=14, then GD=5. But since the options don't include 5, this is still not helpful.

Alternatively, if the problem had HG=10 and HJ=14, and GD=5, then the answer would be 5, but since it's not an option, I'm stuck.

Given all this, I think there must be a mistake in the problem, but since I must choose from the options, and given that the calculation leads to GD=5/4, which is 1.25, and the closest option is none, but perhaps the intended answer is C.14, assuming a miscalculation, I'll guess C.14, though it's not justified. But this is a shot in the dark.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant to say that the length of Line(G,D) is 2x + 2 and Line(D,J) is 2x -4, leading to different results. Let me try that.

Let's say GD=2x+2, DJ=2x-4. Then GJ=GD + DJ=4x-2.

Then, e = 2x-4, d=2x+2. Then e = d -6.

So, e² - d² = (d-6)^2 -d^2 = d² -12d +36 -d² = -12d +36 = HJ² - HG² = 100 -49=51.

So -12d +36=51 → -12d=15 → d=-15/12=-5/4. Negative length, invalid.

No good.

Alternatively, if GD=2x+4 and DJ=2x-2. Then GJ=4x+2. And e=2x+4, d=2x-2. Then e-d=6. So e² -d² = (e-d)(e+d)=6*(4x+2)=24x +12 =51 → 24x=39 → x=13/8. Same result as before. So GD=2x+4=2*(13/8)+4=13/4 +16/4=29/4=7.25. Not an option.

Still no match.

After extensive analysis, I believe the problem contains an inconsistency, but since I must choose, and given that the calculation leads to GD=5/4, which is 1.25, and none of the options match, I'll have to select the closest possible, but since none are close, I might have to conclude that there's an error. However, since the system requires an answer, and assuming that perhaps there was a miscalculation in the problem setup, I'll choose option C.14 as the closest possible, even though it's not mathematically correct. But this is purely speculative.
