MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 2 here. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they connect. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(B,D), Line(A,D), Line(A,C), Line(B,C), Line(A,E), Line(B,E), Line(D,E), Line(C,E). Also, there are some angles specified: Angle(D,A,B) which is 47 degrees, Angle(A,B,C) is 55 degrees, Angle(B,A,C) is 57 degrees. Then there are angles at point E: Angle(A,E,B) is 1 degree, Angle(B,E,C) is 2 degrees, Angle(C,E,D) is 3 degrees. And finally, the sum of these four angles around point E (Angle(A,E,B) + Angle(B,E,C) + Angle(C,E,D) + Angle(D,E,A)) equals 360 degrees. Wait, but the last part says SumOf(Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(D,E,A), 360). So that means those four angles add up to 360 degrees. But we know three of them: 1°, 2°, and 3°, so maybe we can find the fourth?

Wait, the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C). Let me check again. The given angles at E are Angle(A,E,B)=1°, Angle(B,E,C)=2°, Angle(C,E,D)=3°, and the fourth angle is Angle(D,E,A). Their sum is 360°, so adding up 1+2+3+x=360, where x is Angle(D,E,A). That would give x = 360 - 6 = 354°? But that seems way too big. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait, hold on. The sum of the angles around point E should be 360°, since they form a full circle. However, if there are four angles meeting at E, each adjacent pair forming lines connected to E. But looking at the lines: Line(A,E), Line(B,E), Line(C,E), Line(D,E). So those are four lines from E to other points, creating four angles around E. Therefore, the four angles at E: AEB, BEC, CED, DEA. Wait, but according to the predicates, Angle(A,E,B) is 1°, which is angle AEB, Angle(B,E,C) is 2°, which is angle BEC, Angle(C,E,D) is 3°, which is angle CED, and the remaining angle is DEA, which would be angle D-E-A. So yes, those four angles add up to 360°. Therefore, 1 + 2 + 3 + x = 360 => x = 354°. But that seems extremely large. Is there a mistake here?

Alternatively, perhaps the angles listed aren't all the angles around E. Let me check the lines again. Points connected to E are A, B, C, D. So from E, there are four lines: EA, EB, EC, ED. These divide the plane into four angles: AEB, BEC, CED, DEA. Therefore, the sum of these four angles must be 360°. Given that three of them are 1°, 2°, and 3°, the fourth one is 360 - (1+2+3) = 354°. But this seems odd because such a large angle would imply that the points are arranged in a very skewed way. However, maybe it's correct based on the given data. 

But wait, the problem states that the sum of those four angles is 360°, so we can use that equation. But the question is about angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C) = 2°, but that's already given as 2°? Wait no, wait. Wait the problem says "Angle(A,E,B, 1)" which is angle AEB = 1°, "Angle(B,E,C, 2)" which is angle BEC = 2°, "Angle(C,E,D, 3)" which is angle CED = 3°, and the fourth angle is DEA, which is angle D-E-A. So the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + angle DEA = 360°. Therefore, angle DEA = 354°, which seems huge. But maybe there's more to it. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship involving these angles. For example, considering triangles or other polygons. Let me think about the rest of the given information. We also have Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,B,C), and various lines connecting the points. Let me try to sketch mentally the configuration.

First, points A, B, C, D, E. Lines AB, BD, AD, AC, BC, BE, AE, DE, CE. So, for instance, triangle ABD has vertices A, B, D. Triangle ABC has A, B, C. Also, lines like A-C, B-C, so triangle ABC exists. Also, lines AD, BD, so triangle ABD exists. Also, lines connecting E to A, B, C, D. 

Now, the angles given are:

At point A: Angle(DAB) is 47°, since Angle(D,A,B) is 47°. So that's angle at A between DA and BA. 

At point B: Angle ABC is 55°, since Angle(A,B,C) is 55°, which is the angle at B between AB and BC. Also, Angle(B,A,C) is 57°, which is angle at A between BA and CA. Wait, no: Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A between BA and CA? Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X-Y and Y-Z. So Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A between BA and CA. So that's angle BAC, which is 57°. 

So we have triangle ABC with angle at B being 55°, angle at A being 57°, so we can compute the third angle at C. Since angles in triangle sum to 180°, angle at C would be 180 - 55 - 57 = 68°. 

Also, triangle ABD: angle at A is 47°, angle at B? Let's see. But we don't have much info yet. 

Additionally, there are points E connected to A, B, C, D. So E is a common point connected to all these. Now, considering the angles at E, as discussed earlier. But how does that relate to the rest of the diagram?

Perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral or some triangle relations involving E. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABE, BCE, CDE, etc., but I need to find connections.

Alternatively, since the angles around E sum to 360°, and three of them are given (1°, 2°, 3°), then the fourth is 354°, but that seems counterintuitive. However, if that's the case, then angle DEA is 354°, which would mean that the angle between ED and EA is almost a full rotation. But that seems unlikely unless the points are arranged in a very specific way. 

But maybe there's an error in my interpretation. Let me re-examine the predicates. 

Wait, the sum of Angle(A,E,B) + Angle(B,E,C) + Angle(C,E,D) + Angle(D,E,A) is 360. So that's four angles around E, which should indeed sum to 360. So substituting the known values:

1 + 2 + 3 + angle DEA = 360 → angle DEA = 360 - 6 = 354°. But angle DEA is the angle at E between D-E and A-E. So that's a massive angle, suggesting that points D, E, A are almost aligned in a straight line, but with a slight deviation. However, without more constraints, maybe that's acceptable. 

But how does this relate to the rest of the problem? The question is asking for angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C) = 2°. Wait, but that's already given as 2°, so why is it a question? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the problem says "Angle(B,E,C, 2)", which probably means that the measure of angle B-E-C is 2 degrees. Wait, but if that's given, then the answer would just be 2, which isn't among the options. Wait, the answer choices are A. 49, B. 55, C. 57, D. 76. Hmm. So there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the notation is different. Maybe Angle(A,E,B, 1) doesn't mean the measure is 1°, but that the angle is labeled as 1? Or maybe the second argument is the measure. Wait, the original problem says:

"Angle(D,A,B)
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(B,A,C)
Angle(D,A,B, 47)
Angle(A,B,C, 55)
Angle(B,A,C, 57)
Angle(A,E,B, 1)
Angle(B,E,C, 2)
Angle(C,E,D, 3)
SumOf(Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(D,E,A), 360)"

Ah! Oh! I think I misread the Angle predicates. The syntax is likely that Angle(X,Y,Z) represents an angle, and when there's a number after, like Angle(X,Y,Z, n), it means that the measure of that angle is n degrees. So for example, Angle(D,A,B,47) means that the measure of angle DAB is 47 degrees. Similarly, Angle(A,B,C,55) means angle ABC is 55°, and Angle(B,A,C,57) means angle BAC is 57°. 

Then, the other angles like Angle(A,E,B,1) implies that angle AEB is 1°, Angle(B,E,C,2) implies angle BEC is 2°, Angle(C,E,D,3) implies angle CED is 3°, and then SumOf(...) is that the sum of the measures of angle AEB, angle BEC, angle CED, and angle DEA equals 360°. 

Therefore, the four angles around point E are 1°, 2°, 3°, and x (which is angle DEA). So 1 + 2 + 3 + x = 360 → x = 354°. So angle DEA is 354°. But how does this help us find angle 2, which is angle BEC, which is given as 2°? Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, but if angle BEC is given as 2°, then the answer would be 2°, which is not an option. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the notation is different. Maybe the Angle(X,Y,Z) is a variable, and the numbers are labels? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given predicates are not stating the measures directly but rather that certain angles exist. Wait, but the problem includes Angle(D,A,B,47) which suggests that the measure of angle DAB is 47 degrees. Similarly, others. So the presence of the number indicates the measure. Hence, angle BEC is given as 2 degrees. Which would make the answer 2°, but since that's not an option, there must be a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that angle BEC is not given as 2°, but instead, the measure of angle BEC is to be determined, and the other angles are given as 1°, 2°, 3°, and the sum is 360°. Wait, but the wording is confusing. Let me read the original problem again.

Original problem says:

"Predicates:
...
Angle(D,A,B)
Angle(A,B,C)
Angle(B,A,C)
Angle(D,A,B, 47)
Angle(A,B,C, 55)
Angle(B,A,C, 57)
Angle(A,E,B, 1)
Angle(B,E,C, 2)
Angle(C,E,D, 3)
SumOf(Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(D,E,A), 360)"

So, the Angle(X,Y,Z) is a general statement, and when followed by a number, it specifies the measure. So for example, Angle(D,A,B,47) means that the measure of angle DAB is 47°. Similarly, Angle(A,E,B,1) means that measure of angle AEB is 1°, Angle(B,E,C,2) means measure of angle BEC is 2°, etc. 

Thus, angle BEC is given as 2°, which is the measure. But that conflicts with the answer choices. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the angles listed are not the ones I thought. Let me re-express all the angle predicates:

- Angle(D,A,B): This is angle at A between D and B, i.e., angle DAB. 
- Angle(A,B,C): angle at B between A and C, i.e., angle ABC.
- Angle(B,A,C): angle at A between B and C, i.e., angle BAC.
- Angle(D,A,B,47): measure of angle DAB is 47°.
- Angle(A,B,C,55): measure of angle ABC is 55°.
- Angle(B,A,C,57): measure of angle BAC is 57°.
- Angle(A,E,B,1): measure of angle AEB is 1°.
- Angle(B,E,C,2): measure of angle BEC is 2°.
- Angle(C,E,D,3): measure of angle CED is 3°.
- SumOf(..., 360): sum of angles AEB, BEC, CED, DEA is 360°.

So if angle BEC is given as 2°, then the answer would be 2°, which is not an option. Hence, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the angle labels are different. Maybe Angle(A,E,B,1) refers to the angle at E, not at A? No, standard notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(A,E,B) is the angle at E between A and B, which is angle AEB. So that's correct. 

Wait, but maybe the problem uses a different notation. Like, sometimes people write Angle(ABC) as angle at B. So maybe Angle(A,E,B) is angle at E between A and B. Yes, that's consistent. So angle AEB is 1°, angle BEC is 2°, angle CED is 3°, and angle DEA is x. Their sum is 360°, so x = 354°. 

But then the question asks for the measure of angle 2, which is angle BEC, which is given as 2°, so why is it asked? This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I've misunderstood the notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers after the angles are not the measures but identifiers. For example, Angle(A,E,B,1) could mean that this angle is labeled as 1, and the actual measure needs to be found. But that would require more information. 

Let me think differently. Suppose that the numbers after the angle names are the measures, and the question is asking for angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C). But that's given as 2°, which is not in the options. Hence, contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese or another language, and the translation led to confusion. Or maybe the given angles are not all the angles around E. For example, maybe the sum of the angles around E includes other angles? Let me check the lines again. 

Lines from E: EA, EB, EC, ED. So those four lines create four angles around E: AEB, BEC, CED, DEA. Thus, their sum must be 360°, as per the SumOf predicate. So if three of them are 1°, 2°, and 3°, then the fourth is 354°. 

But then why is the question asking for angle 2, which is given as 2°? It must be that I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says "SumOf(Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(D,E,A), 360)". So the sum of these four angles is 360. But what if one of these angles is not explicitly given? For example, maybe Angle(D,E,A) is not given, and we need to find it? But the problem states that Angle(C,E,D,3) is given, Angle(B,E,C,2), Angle(A,E,B,1). So the fourth angle, Angle(D,E,A), is missing. So the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + x = 360, hence x = 354°. 

But the question is asking for angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C), which is given as 2°, so this suggests that the answer is 2°, but since that's not an option, there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the angle 2 refers to something else. For example, in the list of angles around E, maybe there are more than four angles? Or maybe the problem involves other parts of the diagram. Let me look back at the given triangles and lines. 

There are triangles ABD, ABC, and other lines. Let me consider triangle ABD. From earlier, angle at A (DAB) is 47°, angle at B? Let's see. In triangle ABD, we know angle at A is 47°, and we may need to find other angles. But without knowing side lengths or other angles, it's hard to proceed. 

Looking at triangle ABC: angle at A is 57°, angle at B is 55°, so angle at C is 180 - 57 - 55 = 68°. So angle ACB is 68°. 

Now, considering point E. There are lines from E to A, B, C, D. Perhaps there are triangles involving E. For example, triangle ABE, triangle BEC, etc. 

In triangle ABE, we know angle at E is 1°, and maybe other angles can be related. But without more info, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around E is 360°, and knowing that angle DEA is 354°, which would imply that points D, E, A are almost colinear. So line ED is almost overlapping with EA, making a small angle between them. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angle DEA and other angles in the diagram. For instance, if we consider triangle DEA, but without more info on sides or other angles, it's unclear. 

Wait, but maybe the key lies in the triangle ABC and the other angles. For instance, angle BAC is 57°, angle ABC is 55°, angle ACB is 68°. Now, if there's a line from C to E, and from B to E, then maybe triangle BEC has some relation. 

But angle BEC is given as 2°, which is very small. How could that be? If angle BEC is 2°, then points B, E, C are almost collinear, but slightly deviated. 

However, since the answer choices don't include 2°, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the Angle predicates. 

Alternative possibility: The numbers after the angles are not measures but labels for the angles. For example, Angle(A,E,B,1) means that this angle is labeled as 1, and its measure is to be determined. Similarly for others. In this case, we have four angles around E: angle AEB (labeled 1), angle BEC (labeled 2), angle CED (labeled 3), and angle DEA (labeled 4). Their sum is 360°, so 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 360. But we need to find the measure of angle 2, which is angle BEC. 

But then, we have other angle measures given elsewhere. For example, angle DAB is 47°, angle ABC is 55°, angle BAC is 57°. These could be used to find other relationships. 

Let me explore this scenario. Assume that the numbers after the angle names are labels, not measures. So Angle(A,E,B,1) means angle AEB is labeled as 1, and its measure is unknown. Similarly, Angle(B,E,C,2) is angle BEC labeled as 2, whose measure is unknown. Angle(C,E,D,3) is angle CED labeled as 3, measure unknown. Angle(D,E,A,4) is angle DEA labeled as 4, measure unknown. Their sum is 360°. So 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 360. 

But we also have other angle measures given: angle DAB = 47°, angle ABC = 55°, angle BAC = 57°. How can these be connected to the angles around E? 

Maybe using triangle properties or cyclic quadrilaterals. For example, if points A, B, C, D, E lie on a circle, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, considering triangle ABE: angle at E is 1°, angle at A is part of angle BAC, which is 57°, and angle at B is part of angle ABC, which is 55°. But without more info on how E relates to the triangle, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's consider triangle ABE. If we can find other angles in this triangle, we might relate them to angle 1 (AEB). Similarly for other triangles. 

For example, in triangle ABE, we know angle at E is 1°, and we might relate angles at A and B. But angle at A in triangle ABE is part of angle BAC (which is 57°). If we can find how much of angle BAC is taken by angle BAE, then we can find the remaining angle at A. 

Similarly, angle at B in triangle ABE is part of angle ABC (55°). 

But without knowing where E is located relative to the triangle, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, since points A, B, C, D are connected via various lines, perhaps E is inside or outside the triangle. 

Another idea: since there are lines from E to C and D, and from B to E, maybe considering triangle BEC, which has angle at E of 2°, and trying to relate it to other angles. 

But without more information, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since angle DEA is 360 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 354°, which is a very large angle, implying that points D, E, A are nearly colinear. So line ED is almost in the same direction as EA, making a tiny angle between them. 

But how does this relate to other parts of the diagram? 

Maybe considering triangle AED: if angle at E is 354°, then the other two angles at A and D would be very small. But angle at A in triangle AED is part of angle DAB (47°), and angle at D is part of angle ADC or something. 

This seems too vague. Perhaps there's a different approach. 

Wait, going back to the triangle ABC. We have angle at A: 57°, angle at B: 55°, angle at C: 68°. Let me consider if point E is somewhere in relation to this triangle. 

If E is inside the triangle, then the angles around E would involve parts of the triangle's angles. For example, angle AEB, BEC, CED, DEA. 

But without knowing where E is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since there are lines from E to D and C, and from B to E, perhaps E is connected to D and C, forming triangle CED, and so on. 

But I'm stuck. Let me think of another angle. The sum of the angles around E is 360°, and if three of them are 1°, 2°, 3°, then the fourth is 354°. But if angle DEA is 354°, then the angle between ED and EA is 354°, which implies that ED and EA are almost opposite directions, creating a reflex angle. 

But how does this help us find angle 2, which is 2°? It seems like it's given, but since it's not an option, I must be missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the angles are labeled. Maybe the angle 2 is not Angle(B,E,C), but another angle? Or maybe the problem has a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf predicate is not referring to the four angles around E, but to other angles. Let me recheck the SumOf line: 

"SumOf(Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(D,E,A), 360)" 

This likely means that the sum of the measures of these four angles is 360. So, Angle(A,E,B) + Angle(B,E,C) + Angle(C,E,D) + Angle(D,E,A) = 360. 

But if Angle(A,E,B) is 1°, Angle(B,E,C) is 2°, Angle(C,E,D) is 3°, then Angle(D,E,A) = 360 - 1 - 2 - 3 = 354°. 

But the question is asking for Angle(B,E,C), which is 2°, which is given. This suggests that either the question is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the angle labeling. 

Wait, perhaps the angle 2 refers to another angle. For example, in the list of given angles, there's Angle(B,A,C,57), which is angle BAC = 57°, and Angle(A,B,C,55), which is angle ABC = 55°. Maybe angle 2 is referring to one of these? But the question specifically mentions Angle(B,E,C,2), which would be angle BEC. 

Given that the problem provides answer choices of A.49, B.55, C.57, D.76, and if angle BEC is supposed to be one of these, then my previous assumption that it's given as 2° must be wrong. Hence, the correct interpretation must be that the numbers after the angles are the measures, but the question is asking for angle 2, which is part of the sum. 

Wait, but if the sum is 360, and three of the angles are 1°, 2°, 3°, then the fourth is 354°. But how does that relate to other angles in the diagram? 

Perhaps there's a relation between the angles around E and the angles in the triangles. For example, if we consider triangle AED, which has angle at E of 354°, and angles at A and D. But angle at A is part of angle DAB = 47°, and angle at D is part of angle ADC or something else. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check: if the sum of the four angles around E is 360°, and three of them are 1°, 2°, 3°, then the fourth is 354°. But if angle DEA is 354°, then the external angle at E is 354°, which implies that the internal angle is 360 - 354 = 6°, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves the exterior angles or something. 

Wait, another idea: perhaps the given angles around E are not all the angles around E, but only some of them. For example, if E is inside a polygon, and the angles around E are part of larger structures. 

But I'm stuck. Given that the answer choices do not include 2°, and assuming that the question is correctly formulated, I must have misinterpreted the angle labels. 

Let me try one last time: suppose that the numbers after the angle names are the measures, and the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is not given, but part of the sum. Wait, but in the SumOf line, it's the sum of Angle(A,E,B), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), and Angle(D,E,A). If three of these are given (1°, 2°, 3°), and the fourth is unknown, then we can solve for it. But the question asks for angle 2, which is Angle(B,E,C), which is given as 2°. 

Unless there's a typo and the angle 2 is actually the unknown one. For example, if the SumOf line is meant to have four angles, but one of them is unknown. But in the given predicates, Angle(B,E,C,2) is specified, so it's given. 

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that the intended answer is 2°, but since it's not an option, I must have made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, maybe the angle 2 is not Angle(B,E,C), but another angle. 

Wait, let's think about the other given angles. We have angle DAB = 47°, angle ABC = 55°, angle BAC = 57°. Using these, we can find other angles. For example, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 68°, as calculated before. 

Now, if we consider line EC, and since angle at C is 68°, and there's a line from C to E, maybe angle ECD or something relates. 

But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since there's a line from E to D and from E to C, and we have angle CED = 3°, which is very small, suggesting that points C, E, D are almost collinear. 

If angle CED is 3°, and angle at C in triangle ABC is 68°, perhaps there's a relation between angle ECD and angle ACB. For example, if E is on the extension of CD, making angle ECD part of angle ACB. 

But this is pure speculation. 

Assuming that angle ECD is 3°, and angle ACB is 68°, then maybe angle ECB is 68° - 3° = 65°, but I don't see how that connects to angle BEC (which is 2°). 

Alternatively, in triangle BEC, we have angle at E is 2°, angle at C is 68°, and angle at B is something. But without knowing the other angles, it's hard to calculate. 

Wait, if we assume that points B, E, C are such that angle BEC is 2°, and angle at C is 68°, then in triangle BEC, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle at B plus 2° + angle at C = 180°. But angle at B in triangle BEC would be part of angle ABC, which is 55°. If angle at B in triangle BEC is x, then x + 2° + angle at C = 180. But angle at C in triangle BEC would be part of angle ACB, which is 68°. So if angle at C in triangle BEC is y, then y + ... 

But this is getting too abstract. Without more concrete relationships, I cannot proceed. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the only plausible conclusion is that angle BEC is 2°, but since it's not an option, I must have made a fundamental error. Perhaps the correct answer is 2°, and the options are mistyped, or I misread the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle 2 is not Angle(B,E,C), but another angle. For example, if the problem had a typo and the angle 2 is Angle(B,E,A), which is 1°, but that's not an option. 

Given the options provided, and the absence of 2°, I'll have to reconsider. Maybe the angle 2 is not Angle(B,E,C), but another angle in the diagram. For example, if the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is part of the sum, and the sum is 360, with three known angles (1°, 2°, 3°), and the fourth is unknown. Wait, but the question says "Find the measure of ∠2", which was given as 2°, but if it's part of the sum, and the sum is 360, then maybe the question is asking for the fourth angle, which is 354°, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, but the answer choices are A.49, B.55, C.57, D.76. None of these match 2° or 354°. This suggests that there's a completely different approach. 

Let me try to look for other relationships. For example, using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles. 

Consider triangle ABE: angle at E is 1°, angle at A is part of angle BAC = 57°, and angle at B is part of angle ABC = 55°. Let's denote angle at A as α and angle at B as β. Then, α + β + 1° = 180°, so α + β = 179°. But α is part of angle BAC = 57°, and β is part of angle ABC = 55°. If E is inside the triangle, then α + β = 179°, but α ≤ 57° and β ≤ 55°, which would make their sum at most 112°, which is less than 179°. Contradiction. Hence, E must be outside the triangle. 

If E is outside, then angle at A (α) could be greater than 57°, and similarly for β. But this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, since angle DAB is 47°, and angle BAC is 57°, the angle between DA and CA would be 57° - 47° = 10°, assuming that DA and CA are on the same side of AB. 

But without a diagram, it's hard to visualize. 

Another idea: since there are multiple lines from E to various points, maybe applying the concept of exterior angles or using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°. 

But I'm still stuck. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to guess that the intended answer is 2°, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 55° or 57°, which are given as other angles. 

Wait, let me recall that in triangle ABC, angle at B is 55°, and angle at A is 57°. If angle BEC is part of some relationship with these angles, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles involving E. 

For example, in triangle BEC, if we can express some ratios. But without side lengths, it's impossible. 

Alternatively, if points A, B, C, D, E are on a circle, then certain angle relationships would apply. For example, inscribed angles. But there's no indication that they're on a circle. 

Alternatively, since angle DAB is 47°, and angle BAC is 57°, the total angle at A is 47° + 57° = 104°, assuming that DA and CA are on opposite sides of AB. 

But again, without knowing the exact configuration, this is guesswork. 

Given that I'm unable to resolve this, and considering the answer choices, I'll take a chance and say that the measure of angle 2 is 55°, which is option B. But this is purely a guess. Alternatively, since angle at B is 55°, and angle BEC is part of it, perhaps 55° - something = 2°, but this is unclear. 

Wait, if angle ABC is 55°, and angle BEC is part of it, then maybe angle ABC is composed of angle ABE + angle EBC. If angle BEC is 2°, then... No, angle BEC is at E, not at B. 

This is too ambiguous. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll conclude that the intended answer is 55°, which is option B.
