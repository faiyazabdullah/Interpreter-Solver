<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, LMN and QRS, which are congruent. We need to find the value of x. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see how I can connect them.

First, the triangles are congruent, so their corresponding sides and angles should be equal. The problem mentions several equalities involving lengths and angles. Let me jot down the given equations:

For triangle LMN:
- Length of LM = 3x + 5
- Length of MN = y + 6
- Length of LN = 2x + 10

For triangle QRS:
- Length of QR = 2x + 10
- Length of RS = 2y - 12
- Length of QS = 3x + 5

Also, there are angle measures:
- Measure of angle at N in triangle LMN (which is angle MNL?) Wait, the Angle(M,N,L) would be angle at N? Wait, Angle(M,N,L) means vertex at N, with segments NM and NL. So that's angle at N of triangle LMN. Similarly, Angle(R,Q,S) is angle at Q of triangle QRS.

Additionally, it says RightAngle(Angle(L,M,N)) which is angle at M of triangle LMN, since Angle(L,M,N) has vertex at M. Similarly, Angle(Q,R,S) is right angle at R for triangle QRS. 

So, both triangles have right angles. Since they're congruent, their corresponding angles must be equal. Also, the right angles correspond. So, the right angle in triangle LMN is at M (since Angle(L,M,N) is the right angle), and in triangle QRS, the right angle is at R (from Angle(R,Q,S)). Therefore, the right angles correspond, which suggests that the hypotenuses of these triangles would be the sides opposite the right angles. 

In triangle LMN, the right angle is at M, so the hypotenuse would be LN. In triangle QRS, right angle at R, so hypotenuse is QS. Therefore, the hypotenuses LN and QS should be equal. From the given, LN is 2x+10 and QS is 3x+5. Wait, but if they are congruent triangles, their corresponding sides must be equal. But wait, maybe I need to check which sides correspond.

Wait, congruence implies that corresponding parts are equal. However, the order of the letters matters here. The triangles are labeled LMN ≅ QRS. That usually means that vertex L corresponds to Q, M to R, and N to S. Because congruence notation is in order. So, triangle LMN ≅ triangle QRS, so side LM corresponds to QR, MN corresponds to RS, and LN corresponds to QS.

But let me confirm. If the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S, then:

LM corresponds to QR, MN corresponds to RS, LN corresponds to QS.

Therefore, the lengths:

LM = QR → 3x +5 = 2x +10 → Solving gives x=5?

Wait, but also, MN corresponds to RS. MN is y+6, RS is 2y-12. So y+6 = 2y-12 → solving gives y=18.

Then, LN corresponds to QS. LN is 2x +10, QS is 3x +5. Wait, but if the triangles are congruent, then those should be equal. So 2x+10 = 3x +5 → x=5. Hmm, but if x=5, then let's check other equations.

But wait, perhaps there's more constraints. Also, the angles. For example, angle at M in triangle LMN is a right angle, so angle L,M,N is right. Then angle at R in triangle QRS is right angle. So the right angles correspond. Also, the other angles: measure of angle at M (right angle) is y+6? Wait, looking back:

The problem states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), y + 6). Wait, Angle(M,N,L) is angle at N, right? Wait, Angle(M,N,L) would be angle at point N, formed by points M-N-L. Wait, earlier thought was that the right angle is at M. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(L,M,N) is angle at M. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(L,M,N) is angle at M. And it's given as a right angle. So that's the right angle at M. Therefore, angle at M is right. Similarly, Angle(R,Q,S) is angle at Q, which is right angle. So in triangle LMN, right angle at M; in triangle QRS, right angle at Q. Therefore, the legs adjacent to the right angles would be LM and MN for triangle LMN, and QR and RS for triangle QRS.

Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding legs should be equal. So LM corresponds to QR, MN corresponds to RS, and hypotenuses LN corresponds to QS.

So, LM = QR: 3x +5 = 2x +10 ⇒ x=5.

Similarly, MN = RS: y+6 = 2y-12 ⇒ y=18.

Then, hypotenuse LN = QS: 2x +10 = 3x +5 ⇒ x=5. Which is consistent.

But wait, if x=5, then let's check if all the other equations hold. Let me check:

From LM = QR: 3x+5 = 2x+10 ⇒ x=5. Then, substituting x=5 into LM length: 3*5 +5 = 20, QR is 2*5 +10=20. Correct.

MN = y +6, RS = 2y-12. With y=18, MN is 18+6=24, RS is 2*18 -12= 36-12=24. Correct.

Hypotenuse LN: 2x+10 = 2*5 +10=20. QS is 3x+5=3*5 +5=20. Correct.

So x=5 seems to satisfy all these equations. However, the answer options include B as 5. So why isn't this the answer? Wait, but wait, let me check again.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the congruence is given as Triangle(L,M,N) ≅ Triangle(Q,R,S). So the order of the vertices is important. So the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S. Thus, the sides:

LM corresponds to QR,

MN corresponds to RS,

LN corresponds to QS.

Which is what I considered before. Therefore, the equations above hold. So x=5. So answer B. But let me check if there are any other constraints.

Also, there are angle measures. For instance, the measure of angle at N (angle MNL) is given as y +6. Wait, Angle(M,N,L) is angle at N. Let me think about the angles in the triangles.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M. So angles at L and N are complementary. Similarly, in triangle QRS, right-angled at Q, so angles at R and S are complementary.

But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)) is y +6. Wait, Angle(M,N,L) is angle at N. Since triangle LMN is right-angled at M, then angles at L and N sum to 90 degrees. So angle at N is y +6, and angle at L would be 90 - (y+6).

Similarly, in triangle QRS, right-angled at Q, angle at Q is right angle, angle at R and S sum to 90. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,S)) is 2y -12. Wait, Angle(R,Q,S) is angle at Q, which is the right angle. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(R,Q,S) has vertex at Q. So angle at Q. But triangle QRS is right-angled at Q, so angle at Q is 90 degrees. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,S)) should be 90 degrees. But according to the given, it's 2y -12. Therefore, 2y -12 = 90 ⇒ 2y = 102 ⇒ y = 51. Wait, but earlier we had from MN = RS that y=18. This is conflicting. There's inconsistency here. What does this mean?

Hmm, this suggests that there's another equation involving y. Let me re-examine the given data.

The problem states:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), y + 6)

Which is angle at N of triangle LMN equals y +6.

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,S)), 2y -12)

Which is angle at Q of triangle QRS equals 2y -12.

But in triangle QRS, angle at Q is the right angle, because the right angle is at Q (as per the RightAngle(Angle(R,Q,S))? Wait, no. Let me check:

Original predicates:

RightAngle(Angle(L,M,N)) → angle at M is right angle.

RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S)) → angle at Q is right angle.

Yes. So in triangle QRS, angle at Q is right angle, so its measure is 90 degrees. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,S)) is 90°, which equals 2y -12. Hence:

2y -12 = 90 ⇒ 2y = 102 ⇒ y = 51.

But earlier from MN = RS, we had y = 18. Contradiction! So something's wrong here. How come?

This suggests that my initial assumption about the correspondence of the triangles may be incorrect. Maybe the correspondence is different?

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles are congruent via a different correspondence. Let me reconsider the congruence.

Given that Triangle(L,M,N) ≅ Triangle(Q,R,S). The order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So, if the triangles are congruent, then the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So, L corresponds to Q, M to R, N to S. But maybe that's not the case? Maybe the correspondence is different, like L corresponds to R, etc.? Or perhaps the right angles are not aligned as I thought.

Wait, let's consider that the right angles could be in different positions. For example, maybe the right angle in triangle LMN is at N instead of M? Wait, the given RightAngle(Angle(L,M,N)) implies that angle at M is the right angle. Because Angle(L,M,N) is angle at M. So that's fixed. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S)) implies angle at Q is right angle.

So in triangle LMN, right-angled at M, and triangle QRS right-angled at Q. So the correspondence between the triangles must preserve the right angles. Therefore, the right angle in LMN (at M) corresponds to the right angle in QRS (at Q). So the correspondence is such that M maps to Q. Therefore, the correspondence between the triangles would be:

L → R ?

Wait, if M corresponds to Q, then the correspondence might be different. Let me try to figure out the correct correspondence.

Let me denote the triangles:

Triangle LMN: right-angled at M.

Triangle QRS: right-angled at Q.

So, for congruence, the right angles must correspond. Therefore, the right angle at M in LMN corresponds to the right angle at Q in QRS. Therefore, the correspondence between the triangles is such that M ↔ Q, N ↔ R, and L ↔ S? Or some other permutation?

Wait, congruence preserves angles. So, the right angle at M in LMN corresponds to the right angle at Q in QRS. So, the vertex M in LMN corresponds to vertex Q in QRS.

Thus, the correspondence would be:

M ↔ Q,

and then the other vertices accordingly.

So, for triangle LMN: vertices L, M, N.

Corresponding to triangle QRS: vertices Q, R, S.

So, if M corresponds to Q, then the rest of the correspondence depends on the order.

If the congruence is written as Triangle(L,M,N) ≅ Triangle(Q,R,S), then the order of the vertices must be preserved. So, vertex L corresponds to Q, M corresponds to R, and N corresponds to S? Wait, but that would make the right angle at M (in LMN) correspond to R in QRS, but the right angle in QRS is at Q. That doesn't fit. So that's not possible.

Alternative possibility: the correspondence is L ↔ Q, M ↔ S, N ↔ R? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the right angle at M corresponds to the right angle at Q, so M ↔ Q. Then, the other vertices would be arranged accordingly.

Let me think. Suppose that in triangle LMN, the right angle is at M. In triangle QRS, the right angle is at Q. So, for the congruence, the right angles must correspond. Therefore, M corresponds to Q.

So, the correspondence would be:

M → Q,

then, the other vertices must align accordingly.

So, suppose that L corresponds to R, and N corresponds to S? Or L corresponds to S, N corresponds to R?

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is L → R, M → Q, N → S. Let me check.

If that's the case, then:

Side LM corresponds to RQ (since L→R and M→Q),

Side MN corresponds to QS (since M→Q and N→S),

Side LN corresponds to RS (since L→R and N→S).

But then, the right angle at M (in LMN) would correspond to the right angle at Q (in QRS). So that works.

Now, checking the sides:

LM corresponds to RQ: Length LM = 3x +5, Length RQ = 2x +10. So 3x +5 = 2x +10 ⇒ x=5.

MN corresponds to QS: Length MN = y +6, Length QS = 3x +5. Wait, QS is 3x +5, which would be same as LM. Wait, but MN corresponds to QS? If so, then y +6 = 3x +5. But earlier, from LM=RQ, x=5. Then, substituting x=5 into 3x+5 gives 20. So y +6 = 20 ⇒ y=14. But earlier, from the angle measure equation, we had 2y -12 = 90 ⇒ y=51. So conflict again.

Alternatively, if the correspondence is different. Let me think again.

Maybe the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S. As initially thought. Then, the right angle at M (in LMN) corresponds to the right angle at R (in QRS)? No, because in QRS, the right angle is at Q. So that wouldn't work. Therefore, the correspondence cannot be L→Q, M→R, N→S. Hence, there must be a different correspondence where the right angles align.

Another possibility: the correspondence is L→S, M→Q, N→R. So, mapping the right angle at M (LMN) to the right angle at Q (QRS). Then, LM corresponds to SQ, MN corresponds to QR, and LN corresponds to SR.

Let me test this:

If LM corresponds to SQ: Length LM = 3x +5, Length SQ = 3x +5 (since SQ is the same as QS, which is given as 3x +5). So that holds, implying that LM = QS. Which would mean that 3x +5 = 3x +5, which is always true. Not helpful.

But then MN corresponds to QR: Length MN = y +6, Length QR = 2x +10. So y +6 = 2x +10.

Also, LN corresponds to SR: Length LN = 2x +10, Length SR = 2y -12. So 2x +10 = 2y -12.

So from MN=QR: y +6 = 2x +10 → y = 2x +4.

From LN=SR: 2x +10 = 2y -12 → substitute y from previous equation:

2x +10 = 2*(2x +4) -12 → 2x +10 = 4x +8 -12 → 2x +10 = 4x -4 → 10 +4 = 4x -2x → 14 = 2x → x=7.

Then, y = 2*7 +4 = 18.

Now, check the angle measures. 

MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)) is y +6. Angle(M,N,L) is angle at N in triangle LMN. Since triangle LMN is right-angled at M, angle at N is complementary to angle at L. Let's calculate it. 

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M. So, angles at L and N add up to 90 degrees. Let me compute angle at N: y +6. Since angle at N is y +6, then angle at L would be 90 - (y +6).

In triangle QRS, right-angled at Q. The angle at Q is 90 degrees. The measure of angle(R,Q,S) is given as 2y -12. Wait, Angle(R,Q,S) is angle at Q, which is the right angle. So this should be 90 degrees. Hence:

2y -12 = 90 → 2y = 102 → y=51. But earlier we found y=18. Contradiction again.

Ah! So even with this correspondence, there's inconsistency. So what's going on?

Wait, maybe the angle measures aren't directly linked to the sides unless we use trigonometry. Let me think. In triangle LMN, right-angled at M, angle at N is y +6. Using Pythagoras, we can relate the sides.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M, so:

LM² + MN² = LN².

Substituting the expressions:

(3x +5)^2 + (y +6)^2 = (2x +10)^2.

Similarly, in triangle QRS, right-angled at Q, so QR² + RS² = QS².

QR is 2x +10, RS is 2y -12, QS is 3x +5.

So:

(2x +10)^2 + (2y -12)^2 = (3x +5)^2.

But from earlier, if the correspondence is such that LM corresponds to SQ, and MN corresponds to QR, and LN corresponds to SR, then we have:

From LM = QS: 3x +5 = 3x +5 → no info.

From MN = QR: y +6 = 2x +10 → y = 2x +4.

From LN = SR: 2x +10 = 2y -12 → 2x +10 = 2*(2x +4) -12 → 2x +10 = 4x +8 -12 → 2x +10 = 4x -4 → 14 = 2x → x=7, y=18.

Now, plugging x=7 and y=18 into the Pythagorean equations:

For triangle LMN:

LM = 3*7 +5 = 26, MN = 18 +6 =24, LN = 2*7 +10 =24. Wait, LN would be 24? But LM=26, MN=24, LN=24. Then LM² + MN² = 26² +24² = 676 + 576 = 1252. LN² = 24² = 576. These are unequal. So this violates Pythagoras. Hence, contradiction. So something's wrong.

This suggests that the correspondence I assumed is invalid. Hence, there must be a mistake in assuming the correspondence between the triangles.

Let me go back. Perhaps the triangles are congruent via a different correspondence, where the right angles are matched, and the sides are matched accordingly.

Let me try again. Given that both triangles are right-angled, and they are congruent. So, their corresponding legs and hypotenuse must match.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M. So legs are LM and MN, hypotenuse is LN.

In triangle QRS, right-angled at Q. Legs are QR and QS? Wait, no. Wait, right angle at Q, so legs are QR and QS? No, if right angle is at Q, then the legs are the ones forming the right angle, i.e., Q to R and Q to S. So legs QR and QS, and hypotenuse RS.

Wait, no. In triangle QRS, right-angled at Q. So the sides forming the right angle are QR and QS, making RS the hypotenuse.

So, for congruence between LMN and QRS, the legs of one must match the legs of the other, and hypotenuse matches.

So, possibilities:

Either:

Case 1: LM corresponds to QR (leg), MN corresponds to QS (leg), LN corresponds to RS (hypotenuse).

Or Case 2: LM corresponds to QS (leg), MN corresponds to QR (leg), LN corresponds to RS (hypotenuse).

Let's explore both cases.

Starting with Case 1:

LM = QR → 3x +5 = 2x +10 → x=5.

MN = QS → y +6 = 3x +5. With x=5, this becomes y +6 = 20 → y=14.

LN = RS → 2x +10 = 2y -12. Substituting x=5 and y=14: 2*5 +10 = 20, and 2*14 -12 = 28-12=16. 20 ≠16 → contradiction.

Case 2:

LM corresponds to QS (leg): 3x +5 = 3x +5 → always true.

MN corresponds to QR (leg): y +6 = 2x +10 → y = 2x +4.

LN corresponds to RS (hypotenuse): 2x +10 = 2y -12 → substituting y=2x+4:

2x +10 = 2*(2x +4) -12 → 2x +10 =4x +8 -12 → 2x +10 =4x -4 → 14=2x → x=7.

Then y=2*7 +4=18.

Now check Pythagorean theorem for both triangles.

For triangle LMN: right-angled at M, legs LM and MN, hypotenuse LN.

LM = 3x +5 = 3*7 +5 =26, MN=y +6=18+6=24, LN=2x+10=2*7+10=24.

Check LM² + MN² = 26² +24² = 676 + 576 = 1252. LN² =24²=576. Not equal. So not valid.

For triangle QRS: right-angled at Q, legs QR and QS, hypotenuse RS.

QR=2x+10=2*7 +10=24, QS=3x+5=26, RS=2y-12=2*18 -12=36-12=24.

Check QR² + QS² =24² +26² = 576 + 676 = 1252. RS²=24²=576. Again, not equal. So contradiction again.

So this suggests that the assumption of correspondence is still wrong. Where is the error?

Wait, perhaps the hypotenuse in one triangle corresponds to a leg in the other? No, because congruence requires corresponding sides to be equal. So if one triangle's hypotenuse is matched to a leg of the other, that would imply inequality, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me think differently.

Since both triangles are congruent, all corresponding sides must be equal. Let me list all the sides:

For LMN: sides are LM, MN, LN.

For QRS: sides are QR, RS, QS.

We know that both triangles are right-angled. So each has three sides: two legs and a hypotenuse.

Let me assume that the hypotenuse of LMN (LN) corresponds to the hypotenuse of QRS (RS), and the legs correspond accordingly.

So, if LN (hypotenuse of LMN) corresponds to RS (hypotenuse of QRS):

LN = RS → 2x +10 = 2y -12 → Equation 1: 2x +10 = 2y -12.

Also, the legs of LMN are LM and MN, which correspond to legs of QRS. Now, which legs?

Possibility 1: LM corresponds to QR, MN corresponds to QS.

Then:

LM = QR → 3x +5 = 2x +10 → x=5.

MN = QS → y +6 = 3x +5 → with x=5, this is y +6 = 20 → y=14.

Now check Equation 1: 2x +10 = 2y -12 → 2*5 +10 = 10 +10 =20. 2y -12 = 2*14 -12 =28-12=16. 20≠16 → contradiction.

Possibility 2: LM corresponds to QS, MN corresponds to QR.

Then:

LM = QS → 3x +5 = 3x +5 → always true.

MN = QR → y +6 = 2x +10 → y=2x +4.

Equation 1: 2x +10 = 2y -12 → substitute y=2x+4:

2x +10 = 2*(2x+4) -12 → 2x+10 =4x +8 -12 → 2x +10 =4x -4 → 14 = 2x → x=7.

Then y=2*7 +4=18.

Now, check Pythagorean theorem for LMN:

Legs LM=3x+5=3*7+5=26, MN=y+6=18+6=24. Hypotenuse LN=2x+10=24.

Check 26² +24² = 676 + 576 = 1252. LN²=24²=576. Not matching. So contradiction.

Same issue as before.

What if the hypotenuse of LMN corresponds to a leg of QRS? Let's say LN corresponds to QR or QS.

For example, LN (hypotenuse of LMN) corresponds to QR (leg of QRS). Then:

LN = QR → 2x +10 = 2x +10 → always true. No new info.

Then, the other legs: LM and MN of LMN correspond to QS and RS of QRS.

Possibility: LM corresponds to QS, MN corresponds to RS.

So:

LM = QS → 3x+5 = 3x+5 → ok.

MN = RS → y +6 = 2y -12 → y = 18.

Then, from the hypotenuse: LN = QR? Wait, LN is hypotenuse of LMN, QR is a leg of QRS. But if LN corresponds to QR, then QR is a leg, but LN is hypotenuse. So, in this case, QR = LN → 2x +10 = LN = 2x +10 → no new info.

But then, in triangle QRS, legs are QR and QS. QR is 2x+10, QS is 3x+5. Hypotenuse RS = sqrt((2x+10)^2 + (3x+5)^2).

But in triangle LMN, hypotenuse LN = 2x+10. So, for congruence, RS should equal LN? Or wait, if the correspondence is LN (hypotenuse of LMN) corresponds to RS (hypotenuse of QRS)? Or to one of the legs?

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to use the angle measures to get another equation.

Earlier, we saw that MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)) is y +6. This is angle at N in triangle LMN. Since it's right-angled at M, angle at N is complementary to angle at L.

Let me express angle at N in terms of the sides. In a right-angled triangle, tan(angle at N) = opposite / adjacent = LM / MN.

So tan(angle N) = LM / MN = (3x +5)/(y +6). But angle N is y +6 degrees. So:

tan(y +6) = (3x +5)/(y +6).

Similarly, in triangle QRS, right-angled at Q, the measure of angle at Q is 90°, and the other angles are at R and S. The measure of angle(R,Q,S) is given as 2y -12. Wait, angle(R,Q,S) is angle at Q, which is 90°. So 2y -12 = 90 → y=51. But earlier from other equations, y=18 or y=...?

Wait, this gives us a critical equation: 2y -12 = 90 → y=51. So this must hold. Hence, y=51.

But previously, from MN = RS (if correspondence assumes that), we had y=18. Conflict. So where is the mistake?

Let me take this equation seriously: 2y -12 = 90 → y=51.

Now, substitute y=51 into other equations.

Let's revisit the earlier equations. Let's try to find x and y using this.

From the angle measure in triangle LMN: angle at N is y +6. So, angle N = y +6 = 51 +6 = 57 degrees.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M, so angle at L is 90 - 57 = 33 degrees.

Using the tangent ratio: tan(angle N) = LM / MN = (3x+5)/(y +6) = (3x +5)/57.

But angle N is 57 degrees, so tan(57) = (3x +5)/57.

Calculate tan(57°): approximately 1.5399.

So 1.5399 ≈ (3x +5)/57 → 3x +5 ≈ 57 * 1.5399 ≈ 57 * 1.54 ≈ 87.78 → 3x ≈ 87.78 -5 = 82.78 → x ≈ 82.78 /3 ≈ 27.59. Not among the answer choices. But answer choices are 3,5,7,18. So this suggests inconsistency.

But this indicates that my assumption about the correspondence is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the angle measure given is not angle N but something else?

Wait, the given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), y +6). Angle(M,N,L) is angle at N. Yes. So that's correct.

But if y=51, then from other equations, like MN = RS?

If we assume that MN corresponds to RS (assuming some correspondence), then y +6 = 2y -12 → y=18. But from angle measure, y=51. Contradiction.

So there must be a miscalculation or misassumption.

Wait, perhaps the angle measures are not directly related to the sides, but maybe there's another relation. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at N in triangle LMN is equal to the angle at Q in triangle QRS? But angle at Q is 90 degrees, which would mean y +6 = 90 → y=84. But then from angle measure in QRS, 2y -12 = 90 → y=51. Still inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at N in LMN corresponds to angle at S in QRS? Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to combine all equations.

From the angle measure in QRS: 2y -12 = 90 → y=51.

From this, y=51.

Now, let's look at other equations.

Looking at the sides:

For triangle LMN: LM=3x+5, MN=y+6=51+6=57, LN=2x+10.

For triangle QRS: QR=2x+10, RS=2y-12=2*51-12=102-12=90, QS=3x+5.

Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides must be equal. So, we need to match these sides.

Possible correspondences:

Option 1: LM corresponds to QR, MN corresponds to RS, LN corresponds to QS.

So:

LM = QR → 3x +5 = 2x +10 → x=5.

MN = RS → 57 = 90 → false.

Option 2: LM corresponds to QS, MN corresponds to QR, LN corresponds to RS.

So:

LM = QS → 3x+5 = 3x+5 → ok.

MN = QR → 57 = 2x +10 → 2x = 47 → x=23.5. Not in answer choices.

Option 3: LM corresponds to RS, MN corresponds to QS, LN corresponds to QR.

LM = RS → 3x +5 = 90 → 3x=85 → x≈28.33. Not in choices.

Option 4: MN corresponds to QS, LN corresponds to QR, LM corresponds to RS.

MN = QS → 57 = 3x +5 → 3x=52 → x≈17.33. Not in choices.

None of these give x in the answer choices. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the congruence is not preserving the right angles in the way I thought? Or perhaps the triangles are not right-angled? Wait, no. The predicates state RightAngle(Angle(L,M,N)) and RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S)), so they are definitely right-angled.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is such that the hypotenuse of one is a leg of the other? Like, LN (hypotenuse of LMN) corresponds to QR (leg of QRS). Then:

LN = QR → 2x +10 = 2x +10 → no new info.

Then, the other legs: LM and MN of LMN correspond to QS and RS of QRS.

Assume LM = QS and MN = RS.

So:

LM = QS → 3x +5 = 3x +5 → ok.

MN = RS → y +6 = 2y -12 → y=18. But from angle measure, y=51. Conflict.

This is very confusing. It seems like there's a contradiction in the given data unless there's a mistake in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, let me recheck the original problem statement. The user wrote:

"RightAngle(Angle(L,M,N))"
"RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S))"

So, Angle(L,M,N) is the angle at M, which is right. Angle(Q,R,S) is angle at S? Wait, no. Wait, Angle(Q,R,S) has vertex at R. Wait, Angle(Q,R,S) is angle at R, with segments QR and RS. Wait, no, Angle(Q,R,S) is angle at R, formed by points Q-R-S. So, in triangle QRS, angle at R is the right angle? No, because the RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S)) means that angle at R is right. Wait, no! The syntax is Angle(A,B,C) means the angle at B. So Angle(Q,R,S) is angle at R. So, the right angle is at R in triangle QRS. Earlier, I thought it was at Q, but that was incorrect!

Oh my god! I made a critical mistake here. Let me correct this.

Angle(Q,R,S) is the angle at R, not at Q. So the right angle in triangle QRS is at R, not at Q. This changes everything!

So, the right angles are:

- In triangle LMN: right angle at M (from Angle(L,M,N) being right).

- In triangle QRS: right angle at R (from Angle(Q,R,S) being right).

So, both triangles are right-angled, but at different vertices. Now, this affects the correspondence between the triangles.

Now, let's redo the analysis with this correction.

So, for triangle LMN: right-angled at M. So, legs are LM and MN, hypotenuse is LN.

For triangle QRS: right-angled at R. So, legs are QR and RS, hypotenuse is QS.

Now, since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides must be equal. The correspondence between the triangles must map the right angles to each other. So, the right angle at M in LMN corresponds to the right angle at R in QRS.

Thus, the correspondence is such that M ↔ R, and the other vertices accordingly.

Let me determine the correspondence. The congruence is Triangle(L,M,N) ≅ Triangle(Q,R,S). So, the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence: L → Q, M → R, N → S.

Let's verify this. If that's the case, then:

- Vertex L corresponds to Q.

- Vertex M corresponds to R.

- Vertex N corresponds to S.

Thus, the sides:

- LM corresponds to QR.

- MN corresponds to RS.

- LN corresponds to QS.

Now, let's check the right angles: M (in LMN) corresponds to R (in QRS), which is the right angle. Correct.

Now, let's write the equations:

1. LM = QR: 3x +5 = 2x +10 → x=5.

2. MN = RS: y +6 = 2y -12 → y=18.

3. LN = QS: 2x +10 = 3x +5 → x=5.

These are consistent. So x=5, y=18.

Now, let's check the angle measures.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M, angle at N is y +6 = 18 +6 =24 degrees.

In triangle QRS, right-angled at R, angle at Q is 2y -12 = 2*18 -12 = 36 -12 =24 degrees.

So, angle at Q in QRS is 24 degrees, which makes sense since it's part of the right triangle.

Let me verify the Pythagorean theorem for both triangles.

For triangle LMN:

LM = 3x +5 = 3*5 +5 =20.

MN = y +6 =18 +6 =24.

LN = 2x +10 =2*5 +10 =20.

Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse should be the longest side. Here, LM=20, MN=24, LN=20. So, hypotenuse should be MN=24. But according to the correspondence, LN is the hypotenuse of LMN. Wait, this suggests a mistake.

Wait, in triangle LMN, right-angled at M, so hypotenuse is LN. But if LN=20, and MN=24, then LN should be longer than the legs. But 20 < 24, which contradicts. Hence, this suggests an error.

Wait, this implies that my correspondence is wrong. Why? Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is longer than either leg.

Here, LM=20, MN=24, LN=20. So, the hypotenuse should be MN=24, but according to the correspondence, LN is the hypotenuse. So, this is impossible. Hence, contradiction.

Where is the mistake?

Let me re-express the sides.

If the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S, then:

- LM corresponds to QR.

- MN corresponds to RS.

- LN corresponds to QS.

But in triangle LMN, right-angled at M, so hypotenuse is LN.

In triangle QRS, right-angled at R, so hypotenuse is QS.

Thus, LN (hypotenuse of LMN) should equal QS (hypotenuse of QRS).

From given:

LN = 2x +10.

QS = 3x +5.

Setting equal: 2x +10 = 3x +5 → x=5.

With x=5, LN=2*5 +10=20, QS=3*5 +5=20. So they are equal. But in triangle LMN, the hypotenuse is LN=20, and the legs are LM=20 and MN=24. But 20 and 24 are legs, and hypotenuse is 20? That's impossible, since hypotenuse should be longer.

Wait, this suggests that the legs are LM=20 and MN=24, and hypotenuse is LN=20. But this is impossible. So, this indicates that there is a mistake in the correspondence.

Ah! Here's the error: if the triangle is right-angled at M, then the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which is LN. So, LN should be the hypotenuse, and hence should be longer than the legs LM and MN.

But in our case, with x=5, LM=20, MN=24, LN=20. So, LN is shorter than MN, which is a leg. This is impossible. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that the correspondence is incorrect. Let me try another correspondence.

Let me consider that the hypotenuse of LMN (LN) corresponds to the leg of QRS (QR or RS). Let's say LN corresponds to QR.

Then:

LN = QR → 2x +10 = 2x +10 → no new info.

Then, other sides: LM and MN of LMN correspond to RS and QS of QRS.

Let me assume LM corresponds to RS, MN corresponds to QS.

So:

LM = RS → 3x +5 = 2y -12.

MN = QS → y +6 = 3x +5.

We also have from the right angles: in triangle QRS, right-angled at R, so hypotenuse is QS. So QS should be the hypotenuse of QRS, which is the longest side. So, QS > QR and QS > RS.

From above, QS = y +6 (wait, no: MN = QS → y +6 = 3x +5 → QS = y +6.

But QS is hypotenuse of QRS, so QS > QR and QS > RS.

QR is 2x +10.

RS is 2y -12.

So, QS = y +6 > 2x +10 and y +6 > 2y -12.

From y +6 > 2y -12 → 6 +12 > y → y < 18.

Also, y +6 > 2x +10 → y > 2x +4.

Now, from the equations:

From LM = RS → 3x +5 = 2y -12 → 3x +5 +12 = 2y → 3x +17 = 2y → y = (3x +17)/2.

From MN = QS → y +6 = 3x +5 → y = 3x -1.

So, combining both expressions for y:

(3x +17)/2 = 3x -1.

Multiply both sides by 2:

3x +17 = 6x -2 → 17 +2 = 6x -3x → 19 = 3x → x = 19/3 ≈6.333. Not in answer choices.

Not helpful. Let's try another approach.

Since there's a contradiction in the previous correspondence, perhaps the error lies in the assumption about which sides correspond. Let me try to use the angle measures.

From the angle at N in LMN: y +6 = angle N.

In triangle LMN, right-angled at M, so angle N = y +6, angle L = 90 - (y +6).

In triangle QRS, right-angled at R, angle at Q is 2y -12. Let's call this angle Q.

So, in triangle QRS, angle at Q is 2y -12, angle at S is 90 - (2y -12) = 102 - 2y.

Now, since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles should be equal. So, angle N in LMN corresponds to angle Q in QRS, or angle L in LMN corresponds to angle S in QRS, or some other pairing.

Let me assume
