MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, G. There's a circle O. The lines AD and BC are chords of the circle O. These two chords intersect at point E. Also, we know some lengths: DE is 4 units, EC is 9 units. Then there's an equation involving the product of AE and BE equals the product of EC and DE. And we need to find x, which is the length of AE and BE since they're equal.

So, first, let me visualize the scenario. There's a circle with two chords AD and BC intersecting at point E. That means E is inside the circle where the two chords cross. From the properties of circles, when two chords intersect, there's a theorem that says the products of the segments are equal. Wait, yes! The Intersecting Chords Theorem states that if two chords intersect at a point, then the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. 

So applying that here, since AD and BC intersect at E, then AE * ED = BE * EC. But wait, according to the given, AE and BE are both equal to x. So substituting into the theorem: x * ED = x * EC? Wait, but ED is given as 4, and EC is 9. Wait, that would mean x*4 = x*9, which implies 4x=9x, leading to 5x=0, so x=0. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I got the segments wrong.

Wait, hold on. Let me recall the exact statement of the theorem. When two chords intersect, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal. So if chords AB and CD intersect at E, then AE * EB = CE * ED. Wait, but in our case, the chords are AD and BC. Let me clarify the segments.

Let me denote the chords as AD and BC intersecting at E. Therefore, chord AD is split into segments AE and ED, and chord BC is split into BE and EC. According to the theorem, AE * ED = BE * EC. 

But according to the problem, ED is 4, EC is 9. Also, AE and BE are both equal to x. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), x) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), x). So AE = x and BE = x. Therefore, substituting into the theorem:

AE * ED = BE * EC  
=> x * 4 = x * 9  
Which simplifies to 4x = 9x => 5x = 0 => x = 0. Which is impossible because lengths can't be zero. Therefore, something's wrong here. Maybe my understanding of the segments is incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the theorem. Let me check again. Let me re-examine the chords. The chords are AD and BC. So chord AD has endpoints A and D, and chord BC has endpoints B and C. They intersect at E. Therefore, the segments of AD are AE and ED, and the segments of BC are BE and EC. Therefore, the theorem should state that AE * ED = BE * EC. 

But according to the problem, ED is 4 and EC is 9. So substituting gives x * 4 = x * 9. This leads to 4x = 9x, implying x=0. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the product of AE and BE equals the product of EC and ED. Wait, looking back at the problem's last equality: 

"Equals(Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), LengthOf(Line(B,E))), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), LengthOf(Line(D,E))))"

So it's saying that AE * BE = EC * ED. Which is exactly the same as the intersecting chords theorem. But according to that, if AE = x, BE = x, EC = 9, ED = 4, then x^2 = 9*4 = 36. Hence x = sqrt(36) = 6. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if AE * BE equals EC * ED, then substituting gives x*x = 9*4 → x² = 36 → x = 6. That makes sense!

So why did I get confused before? Because I thought the theorem was AE * ED = BE * EC, but actually the theorem is AE * BE = CE * ED. Wait, let me confirm the exact wording of the theorem. 

Yes, the correct formula is that when two chords intersect, the product of the parts of one chord equals the product of the parts of the other chord. So if chords AD and BC intersect at E, then AE * BE = CE * DE. Wait, no—wait, chord AD is split into AE and ED, chord BC into BE and EC. Therefore, the correct relation is AE * ED = BE * EC. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. Now I'm confused again. 

Hold on, maybe I need to double-check the theorem. Let me recall: if two chords intersect at E, then AE * EC = BE * ED? No, that's not right. Let me look up the exact statement. 

Actually, the correct statement is that for two chords intersecting at E, the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. So if chord AD intersects chord BC at E, then AE * ED = BE * EC. Wait, but that would mean AE * ED = BE * EC. However, in the problem, the equation given is AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would imply that the theorem is being applied incorrectly here. 

Wait, but according to the problem's equation, it's AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would suggest that the theorem isn't directly applicable unless there's a different configuration. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the segments. Let me try again.

Suppose chords AD and BC intersect at E. Then, according to the intersecting chords theorem, AE * ED = BE * EC. But in the problem, they say that AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would imply that AE * BE = EC * ED. So unless there's another relationship. 

Wait, but maybe the problem's equation is actually correct, and I have to use it. Let me check again. The problem states: 

"Equals(Mul(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), LengthOf(Line(B,E))), Mul(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), LengthOf(Line(D,E))))"

So that translates to AE * BE = EC * ED. Which is different from the standard theorem. So either the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe the chords aren't AD and BC, but different ones. Wait, the given predicates are IsChordOf(Line(A,D), Circle(O)) and IsChordOf(Line(B,C), Circle(O)). So lines AD and BC are chords of the circle. Their intersection is point E. 

Therefore, according to the intersecting chords theorem, AE * ED = BE * EC. But the problem says that AE * BE = EC * ED. So unless there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, let's write down both possibilities. 

Case 1: Using the standard theorem: AE * ED = BE * EC. Given ED = 4, EC = 9, AE = BE = x. Then x*4 = x*9 → 4x = 9x → contradiction. 

Case 2: If the problem's equation is AE * BE = EC * ED, then x * x = 9 * 4 → x² = 36 → x = 6. Which is a valid answer. 

But why does the problem's equation differ from the standard theorem? Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in segment labeling. Let me re-express the segments. 

If the chords are AD and BC, then the segments are: 

For chord AD: AE and ED. 

For chord BC: BE and EC. 

Then the theorem says AE * ED = BE * EC. 

But the problem says that AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would be equivalent to AE * BE = ED * EC. Which is the same as AE * BE = ED * EC. 

This suggests that the problem's equation is rearranged. So if AE * BE = ED * EC, then substituting the given numbers: x * x = 4 * 9 → x² = 36 → x = 6. 

But why does the problem's equation not match the standard theorem? Unless there's a mistake in the problem's phrasing, or perhaps the labels of the points are different. 

Alternatively, maybe the chords are not AD and BC, but AB and DC? Or some other combination. Wait, no—the given is IsChordOf(Line(A,D), Circle(O)) and IsChordOf(Line(B,C), Circle(O)). So lines AD and BC are chords. 

Wait, perhaps the segments are different. For example, if the intersection divides the chords such that for AD, the segments are AE and ED, and for BC, the segments are BE and EC. Then the theorem says AE * ED = BE * EC. However, the problem's equation is AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would require that AE * BE = EC * ED. 

But if we substitute, that would give us x * x = 9 * 4 → x² = 36 → x = 6. Which works. 

However, according to the theorem, AE * ED = BE * EC → x * 4 = x * 9 → 4x = 9x → x=0. Which is impossible. 

So there's a contradiction here. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or there's a different configuration. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

The problem says: 

"IntersectAt(Line(A,D), Line(B,C), Point(E))"

So the lines AD and BC intersect at E. 

Then, the lengths given are:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), 4)

Which is DE = 4.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 9)

Which is EC = 9.

So for line AD, the segments are AE and ED, with ED = 4. 

For line BC, the segments are BE and EC, with EC = 9. 

According to the theorem, AE * ED = BE * EC → AE * 4 = BE * 9. 

But the problem says that AE * BE = EC * ED → x * x = 9 * 4 → x² = 36 → x = 6. 

But according to the theorem, it's AE * ED = BE * EC → x * 4 = x * 9 → 4x = 9x → x=0. 

This inconsistency suggests that either there's an error in the problem, or I have misinterpreted the segments. 

Wait, perhaps the segments are not AE and ED for AD, but rather AE and ED? Let me draw a diagram mentally. Suppose line AD passes through E, so starting from A to D, passing through E. So the segments are AE and ED. Similarly, line BC passes through E, so segments BE and EC. 

Thus, the theorem applies to these segments. 

But the problem's equation is AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would be AE * BE = EC * ED → x * x = 9 * 4 → x=6. 

But according to the theorem, it should be AE * ED = BE * EC → x * 4 = x * 9 → contradiction. 

So why is there a discrepancy? It seems like the problem's equation is different from the theorem. This suggests that either the problem is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the setup. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different theorem, such as power of a point. Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point E inside the circle, the product of the segments of any two chords through E is equal. So indeed, AE * ED = BE * EC. 

But the problem's equation is AE * BE = EC * ED. Which would imply that AE * BE = ED * EC. Which is the same as AE * BE = ED * EC. Which is different from the standard theorem. 

Unless there's a different configuration. For instance, if the point E were outside the circle, then the power of a point would be different. But the problem mentions that AD and BC are chords, so E must be inside the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves secants instead of chords, but the given says they are chords. 

Hmm. Since the problem gives us that AE * BE = EC * ED, and asks for x, which is AE and BE, then regardless of the theorem, we can proceed with the given equation. 

Given that, even though it conflicts with the theorem, the problem explicitly states that AE * BE = EC * ED. Therefore, we can take that as a given condition and solve accordingly. 

So plugging in the known values: x * x = 4 * 9 → x² = 36 → x = 6. 

Hence, the answer is 6, which corresponds to option A. 

Even though there's a conflict with the theorem, the problem provides the equation as part of the given conditions, so we have to go with that. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
