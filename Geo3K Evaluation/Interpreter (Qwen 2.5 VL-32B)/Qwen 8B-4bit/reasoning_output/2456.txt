Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There are two circles: LargerCircle and SmallerCircle. Some lines are chords of these circles. Also, there are some angle bisectors and inscribed angles mentioned. The question asks for the measure of arc CF, given some other arc measures and angles.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them again:

- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all points.
- LargerCircle and SmallerCircle are circles.
- Line AB is a chord of LargerCircle.
- Lines CF and EF are chords of SmallerCircle.
- Point G lies on both LargerCircle and SmallerCircle.
- Points A and B lie on LargerCircle; points C, E, F lie on SmallerCircle.
- Line GE bisects angle EGB and also angle EFB.
- Angles EGB and EFB are inscribed angles over arcs EB of LargerCircle and arc EF of SmallerCircle respectively.

Given measures: arc FE is 118 degrees, arc AB is 108 degrees, angle EGB is 52 degrees, angle EFB is 30 degrees. Need to find arc CF.

Hmm. Let me visualize. Since points C, E, F are on the SmallerCircle, so arc CF would be part of that circle. But how do I relate the given angles to the arcs?

Wait, there's an inscribed angle theorem here. An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. For example, angle EGB intercepts arc EB on the LargerCircle. Similarly, angle EFB intercepts arc EF on the SmallerCircle. Wait, but angle EFB is given as 30 degrees. According to the inscribed angle theorem, that should be half the measure of arc EF. Wait, but arc EF is given as 118 degrees? Wait, wait, the problem says m∠EFB = 30, and m arc FE = 118. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something here.

Wait, the inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, then the measure of angle EFB should be half of arc EF. But according to the problem, arc FE is 118°, so arc EF would be the same as arc FE, since they're the same arc just traversed in opposite direction. Wait, but arcs are typically measured as the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. However, sometimes arcs can be major or minor. Hmm.

But given that angle EFB is 30°, which is supposed to be half the measure of arc EF. Then arc EF would be 60°, but the problem says arc FE is 118°. That contradicts. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood which arc is being intercepted. Maybe angle EFB intercepts another arc?

Wait, looking back at the predicates: IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,G,B), Arc(E,B,LargerCircle)) — so angle EGB intercepts arc EB on the larger circle. And IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,F,B), Arc(E,F,SmallerCircle)) — angle EFB intercepts arc EF on the smaller circle. Therefore, angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF on the smaller circle, so its measure is half of arc EF. Given that angle EFB is 30°, then arc EF would be 60°, but the problem states that m arc FE is 118°. Wait, this seems conflicting. Unless arc EF is actually the major arc? Because if arc EF is the major arc, then the inscribed angle would be half of that. Wait, but inscribed angles usually refer to the arc that's less than 180°, unless specified otherwise. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The problem says m arc FE is 118°, which is given. But angle EFB is 30°, which is supposed to intercept arc EF. So if angle EFB intercepts arc EF, then 30° = ½ × arc EF → arc EF = 60°, but the given arc FE is 118°. That doesn't align. So maybe there's a different arc being intercepted?

Wait, perhaps the angle EFB isn't intercepting arc EF directly. Let me think about where point G is. Since G is on both circles. From the predicates: Line GE bisects angle EGB and angle EFB. So point G is such that GE bisects those angles.

Let me consider the diagram. Let me sketch mentally. Points E and B are connected by a line. Point F is on the smaller circle. Line EF is a chord of the smaller circle. Point G is on both circles. So GE is an angle bisector for angle EGB and angle EFB. 

So angle EGB is formed by points E-G-B, and GE bisects it. Similarly, angle EFB is formed by E-F-B, and GE bisects that angle as well. So point G is equidistant from certain sides? Or maybe lies somewhere such that those bisectors hold.

Now, since angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF on the smaller circle. But earlier calculation suggests that if angle EFB is 30°, then arc EF should be 60°, but the problem gives arc FE as 118°. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the intercepted arc is not EF but another arc. Wait, maybe the angle EFB intercepts arc EB instead? Wait, but the predicate says it intercepts arc EF. Wait, the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,F,B), Arc(E,F,SmallerCircle)). So yes, it's intercepting arc EF. Therefore, the measure of angle EFB is half the measure of arc EF. Hence, arc EF should be 60°, but the problem states that arc FE is 118°, which is the same as arc EF. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe arc FE refers to the major arc? Because if arc FE is 118°, then the minor arc FE would be 118°, making the major arc FE equal to 360° - 118° = 242°. But inscribed angles can't intercept major arcs unless specified. Wait, but inscribed angles can intercept either arc depending on the position of the points. Wait, but if the angle is formed by points E, F, B, then the intercepted arc would be the one not containing the vertex. Wait, in standard terms, the inscribed angle intercepts the arc that is opposite the angle. So for angle EFB, which is at point F, the intercepted arc would be arc EB. Wait, but the predicate says it intercepts arc EF. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misinterpretation of the predicate.

Looking back at the predicates:

IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,F,B), Arc(E,F,SmallerCircle)).

This suggests that angle EFB (at point F) intercepts arc EF. But in reality, angle EFB intercepts arc EB. Unless the arc is named differently. Wait, maybe the arc is named as EF, but the actual arc is EB. Wait, perhaps the arc is named with endpoints E and F, but the actual arc could be the other way around. Alternatively, maybe the arc is referring to the arc that is opposite the angle. Wait, this needs clarification.

Alternatively, maybe the arc is EF, but in the smaller circle, points E and F are endpoints of a chord, so the arc EF could be the arc that's part of the circle. If the angle EFB is formed by points E, F, B, then the intercepted arc would depend on where B is located relative to the circle.

Wait, but point B is on the larger circle, not necessarily on the smaller one. So point B is outside the smaller circle? Because the SmallerCircle has points C, E, F. So point B is on the larger circle, but not necessarily on the smaller circle. Therefore, angle EFB is formed by points E, F, B. Since E and F are on the smaller circle, and B is outside. So the inscribed angle at F would intercept arc EB? But point B may not be on the smaller circle. Therefore, the intercepted arc would be arc EB on the smaller circle? Or maybe not. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the given data. We know that angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle. If it's an inscribed angle, then the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if angle EFB intercepts arc EF on the smaller circle, then arc EF would be 60°, but the problem states that arc FE is 118°, which would imply that arc FE is 118°, so arc EF is 118°, leading to a conflict. Therefore, my assumption that angle EFB intercepts arc EF must be wrong.

Perhaps the intercepted arc is not EF but another arc. Let me re-examine the predicate: IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,F,B), Arc(E,F,SmallerCircle)). So according to the predicate, angle EFB intercepts arc EF on the smaller circle. Therefore, even though intuitively, I thought it should intercept arc EB, the predicate says it's arc EF. So perhaps the arc EF is the one that is intercepted. Therefore, regardless of intuition, the given data says that angle EFB corresponds to arc EF. Thus, angle EFB = ½ arc EF. Therefore, arc EF = 60°, but the problem says arc FE is 118°. Wait, arc FE is the same as arc EF, so this seems inconsistent. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made an error in interpreting the intercepted arc.

Alternatively, maybe the arc is not EF but another arc. Perhaps the arc is EB? Let me think. If angle EFB intercepts arc EB, then angle EFB would be half of arc EB. But the predicate says it intercepts arc EF. So this is conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps the arc is named incorrectly in the predicate. Maybe it should be arc EB instead of EF? But the user provided the predicates, so I have to work with them. Maybe there's a typo, but assuming the predicates are correct, I have to proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the arc EF is a major arc. Suppose that arc EF is a major arc, measuring 118°, and the inscribed angle intercepts that. But inscribed angles usually intercept the minor arc unless stated otherwise. However, if the angle is formed by points E, F, B, and B is outside the circle, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that does not contain B. But if B is outside the circle, then the intercepted arc would be the arc EF that does not pass through B. But since B is not on the smaller circle, we don't know where it is. 

Alternatively, maybe arc EF is the minor arc, but the given measure is 118°, which is greater than 90°, but still less than 180°? No, because 118° is less than 180°, so it's a minor arc. Then angle EFB should be half of that, which would be 59°, but the given angle is 30°, which doesn't fit. 

Wait, this is very confusing. Maybe I need to look at the other given data. The problem also mentions angle EGB is 52°, which intercepts arc EB on the larger circle. So angle EGB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, so angle EGB = ½ arc EB. Therefore, arc EB would be 104°, since 52*2=104. Now, given that arc AB is 108°, which is another arc on the larger circle. 

So, if arc AB is 108°, and arc EB is 104°, then perhaps we can find other arcs on the larger circle. But how does that relate to the smaller circle?

Also, since point G is on both circles, so it's a common point. So G lies on both the larger and smaller circles. 

Let me try to summarize the given info:

From angle EGB = 52°, which intercepts arc EB on larger circle: arc EB = 104°.

Arc AB is given as 108°, so arc AB = 108°.

Since points A and B are on the larger circle, and arc AB is 108°, then the rest of the circle can be computed. For instance, if we can find other arcs on the larger circle.

Additionally, since point G is on the larger circle, and also on the smaller circle, maybe there's some relationship between arcs on both circles.

But let's get back to the main issue: finding arc CF. 

We need to relate the given information about the smaller circle. 

We know that arc FE is 118°, and angle EFB is 30°, which intercepts arc EF. But earlier calculation suggests that angle EFB should be half arc EF, implying arc EF is 60°, conflicting with the given 118°. This inconsistency indicates that maybe the angle EFB is not an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, but rather another arc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but a different type. Wait, but the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(E,F,B), Arc(E,F,SmallerCircle)), so it's explicitly stated as an inscribed angle. Therefore, we have to take that as given. 

This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but something else. Wait, but the definition of an inscribed angle is when the vertex is on the circle. In this case, point F is on the smaller circle, so angle EFB is indeed an inscribed angle with vertex at F, which is on the circle. Therefore, it should intercept arc EB, not EF. Wait, but the predicate says it intercepts arc EF. So why is that?

Ah! Maybe the intercepted arc is not the arc between E and F, but the arc that is opposite to the angle. Wait, when you have an inscribed angle at point F, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing F. So if points E and B are on the circle, then the intercepted arc would be arc EB. But in this case, point B is not necessarily on the smaller circle. Wait, point B is on the larger circle, but not sure if it's on the smaller one. 

Wait, the SmallerCircle has points C, E, F. So point B is not on the smaller circle. So angle EFB is formed by points E (on smaller circle), F (on smaller circle), and B (not on smaller circle). Therefore, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite to angle EFB. Since the angle is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that doesn't contain F. But since B is outside the smaller circle, the arc would be the arc from E to B passing through... Wait, but B is not on the smaller circle. So the intercepted arc would be the arc from E to F that does not contain B? Or maybe it depends on the position of B.

This is getting too vague without a diagram. Let me try to think of another approach. 

Since GE bisects angle EGB and angle EFB, and G is on both circles. So GE is the angle bisector for both angles at G. So maybe triangle EGB and EFB share some properties?

Also, angle EGB is 52°, which we said earlier implies arc EB on the larger circle is 104°. Arc AB is 108°, so maybe arc AE or something else can be found?

Let me try to calculate arc EB on the larger circle. If arc AB is 108°, and arc EB is 104°, then arc AE would be arc AB minus arc BE? Wait, depends on the order of points. Assuming points A, E, B are arranged on the larger circle, but we don't know the order. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that point G is on the larger circle. Since G is on the larger circle and also on the smaller circle. Let me consider the larger circle first.

On the larger circle, points A and B are on it, and arc AB is 108°. Also, point G is on the larger circle. So angle EGB is 52°, which intercepts arc EB. So arc EB is 104°, as before. If we can find more arcs on the larger circle, maybe we can relate them to the smaller circle.

Now, moving to the smaller circle. Points C, E, F are on it. Arc FE is 118°, and angle EFB is 30°, which intercepts arc EF. But according to the inscribed angle theorem, angle EFB = ½ arc EF => arc EF = 60°, conflicting with given 118°. So this suggests that either the problem has conflicting data, or I'm misinterpreting the intercepted arc.

Alternatively, maybe the arc is not EF but another arc. Let me think again. If angle EFB is formed by points E, F, B, and B is outside the smaller circle, then the intercepted arc would be arc EF that does not contain B. But since B is outside, the arc EF would be the one that is opposite to B. So if arc EF is 118°, then angle EFB would be half of that, which would be 59°, but the given angle is 30°, which still doesn't match.

Wait, but maybe angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but a different type. Wait, but point F is on the circle, so angle EFB should be an inscribed angle. So why is there a discrepancy? This is perplexing.

Maybe the arc FE is not the arc intercepted by angle EFB. Let me consider the possibility that the angle EFB intercepts arc EB on the smaller circle. Even though the predicate says it intercepts arc EF, maybe there's a mistake in the predicate. Let me assume that the intercepted arc is EB instead. Then angle EFB would be ½ arc EB. If arc EB on the smaller circle is x, then angle EFB = x/2. Given angle EFB is 30°, so x = 60°. But then arc FE is given as 118°, which is a separate arc. How does that relate?

If arc FE is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, then the total circumference of the smaller circle would be 360°, so the sum of all arcs should be 360°. If we have arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, and other arcs. But I don't know other arcs yet. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arcs on the smaller circle. Points C, E, F are on it. So arc CF is what we need to find. If we can find other arcs on the smaller circle, like arc CE or arc FB, etc., we could compute arc CF.

But how? Without knowing more about the configuration of the points on the smaller circle, it's hard to say. 

Another thought: since GE bisects angle EFB, and G is on the smaller circle. So angle EGB and angle EFB are both bisected by GE. This suggests that GE is the angle bisector, so maybe there's some symmetry or property we can exploit.

Also, since G is on both circles, it's a common point. So maybe there's a relationship between arcs on both circles involving point G.

Alternatively, considering the larger circle: arc EB is 104°, as determined from angle EGB = 52°. On the smaller circle, if arc EB is 60°, then perhaps there's a connection. But I don't see it immediately.

Let me try to tackle the problem step by step with the available info, despite the confusion.

First, handle the larger circle:

- Points A and B are on larger circle, arc AB = 108°.
- Point G is on larger circle.
- Angle EGB = 52°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB on larger circle, so arc EB = 2 * 52 = 104°.
- Therefore, arc EB = 104°.

Now, on the larger circle, arc AB is 108°, arc EB is 104°. Depending on the arrangement of points, we might find other arcs. For example, if points A, E, B are arranged such that arc AE + arc EB = arc AB, or some combination. But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky.

Next, consider the smaller circle:

- Points C, E, F are on smaller circle.
- Arc FE = 118°, given.
- Angle EFB = 30°, which is an inscribed angle. If we assume it intercepts arc EF, then arc EF = 60°, conflicting with given 118°. So this is problematic.
- Alternatively, if angle EFB intercepts arc EB on the smaller circle, then arc EB = 60°, and arc FE = 118°, so total arc for EB and FE would be 60+118=178°, leaving arc EC or something else.

But how to connect this with other information?

Also, since GE bisects angle EFB, and G is on both circles. Let me consider triangle EFB. GE is the angle bisector of angle EFB, so it divides the angle into two equal parts. Given that angle EFB is 30°, each part would be 15°. So angle EFG and angle GFB are each 15°. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Also, since G is on the smaller circle, and line GE is a bisector, maybe there's some relationship between arcs on the smaller circle. For instance, if GE bisects angle EFB, then maybe it relates to the arcs subtended by those angles.

Alternatively, since G is on the smaller circle, and E and F are points on it, the angles at G might relate to arcs. For example, angle EGF might be related to arc EF, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the smaller circle. Points C, E, F are on it. Arc FE is 118°, so the arc from F to E is 118°. We need to find arc CF. Let's denote the measure of arc CF as x. Then, if we can find other arcs on the smaller circle, we can solve for x.

Assuming that the entire circle sums to 360°, the sum of arcs CF, FE, and EC would be 360°. But we only know arc FE is 118°, and arc CF is x. What about arc EC? Not sure yet.

However, we have angle EFB = 30°, which is an inscribed angle. If we can relate this to arc EC or something else.

Wait, if angle EFB intercepts arc EC, then angle EFB = ½ arc EC. Given angle EFB is 30°, then arc EC would be 60°, and arc CF would be 360 - (arc FE + arc EC) = 360 - (118 + 60) = 182°, which doesn't make sense because arcs should be less than 360°, but this would give arc CF as 182°, but that's a large arc. But the answer choices are 30, 44, 108, 118. None of these match.

Alternatively, if angle EFB intercepts arc EF, then arc EF = 60°, but given as 118°, which is a contradiction. So this approach might be wrong.

Another idea: since GE bisects angle EFB, and G is on the smaller circle, maybe there's a relationship between the arcs subtended by angles at G. For example, angle EGB and angle EFB might relate to arcs on the respective circles.

On the larger circle, angle EGB = 52°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB = 104°. On the smaller circle, angle EFB = 30°, which is an inscribed angle. If it intercepts arc EF, then arc EF = 60°, but given as 118°, so this is conflicting. However, if we ignore the given arc FE and go with the angle, then arc EF = 60°, and since arc FE is given as 118°, this suggests that maybe arc FE is the major arc, and the inscribed angle intercepts the minor arc EF, which is 60°, while the major arc FE is 118°. Wait, but how can the same arc have two measures? Arc FE can be either minor or major, depending on the context. If the inscribed angle intercepts the minor arc EF, then it's 60°, and the major arc FE is 360 - 60 = 300°, which is not matching the given 118°. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency, possibly due to a misread of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the arc FE is referring to the arc that is not intercepted by the angle. For example, if angle EFB intercepts arc EB on the smaller circle, then arc EB would be 60°, and arc FE would be 118°, giving us the remaining arc. Let me try this scenario.

Assume that angle EFB intercepts arc EB on the smaller circle, so arc EB = 60°. Given arc FE is 118°, then the remaining arc would be arc EC. Since the total circle is 360°, arc CF + arc FE + arc EB + arc BC? Wait, points C, E, F are on the smaller circle. So the arcs are CF, FE, and EC. Wait, if points C, E, F are on the smaller circle, then the arcs between them are CF, FE, and EC. So total arc CF + arc FE + arc EC = 360°. Given arc FE = 118°, and arc EC = ? If we can find arc EC, then arc CF = 360 - (FE + EC).

But how to find arc EC? If angle EFB intercepts arc EB, then arc EB = 60°. But point B is not on the smaller circle. So arc EB would be a different arc. Wait, but B is on the larger circle, not the smaller one. So arc EB on the smaller circle would be the arc from E to B passing through C? No, because B is not on the smaller circle. So this is unclear.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to look for other clues. 

Given that arc AB is 108° on the larger circle, and arc EB is 104°, maybe we can find other arcs on the larger circle. Let's suppose that points A, E, B are arranged such that arc AE + arc EB = arc AB. If arc EB is 104°, and arc AB is 108°, then arc AE would be 108 - 104 = 4°. That seems very small, but mathematically possible. 

Then, since point G is on the larger circle, and angle EGB is 52°, which intercepts arc EB. So arc EB = 104°, as before. 

Now, considering the smaller circle, with points C, E, F. We need to find arc CF. Given that arc FE is 118°, and angle EFB is 30°. If we can relate this to arc CF.

Wait, maybe using the fact that GE is the angle bisector. Since GE bisects angle EFB (which is 30°), creating two angles of 15° each. So angle EFG = 15° and angle GFB = 15°. 

Now, since G is on the smaller circle, and E and F are on it, then angles at G might relate to arcs. For example, angle EGF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, or something like that. 

If angle EGF is an inscribed angle, then it would be half the measure of arc EF. But we don't know angle EGF. However, we know angle EGB is 52°, which is on the larger circle. 

Alternatively, since GE is an angle bisector, maybe there's a relationship between arcs on the smaller circle. 

Let me consider triangle EFG and triangle EFG. Wait, not helpful. 

Alternatively, since GE bisects angle EFB, and G is on the smaller circle, maybe it creates isosceles triangles or something. 

Alternatively, since angle EFB is 30°, and it's split into 15° each by GE, maybe the arcs related to those angles are related. For example, if angle EFG = 15°, then it might be half of arc EG. Wait, no, because angle EFG is at point F, so it would intercept arc EG. But point G is on the smaller circle, so arc EG would be the arc from E to G. 

But I don't know where G is on the smaller circle. However, since G is also on the larger circle, and arc EB on the larger circle is 104°, maybe there's a way to relate arc EG on the smaller circle to something else. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to switch gears and look at the answer choices. The options are 30, 44, 108, 118. Given that arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and angle EGB is 52°, angle EFB is 30°. 

If arc CF is to be found, and given that arc FE is 118°, maybe arc CF is related to the difference between arc FE and some other arc. 

Wait, let's think about the smaller circle. If arc FE is 118°, and we need arc CF. If we can find the measure of arc EC, then arc CF = arc FE + arc EC or something. But without knowing arc EC, it's hard. 

Wait, but angle EFB is 30°, which is an inscribed angle. If we assume it intercepts arc EC, then arc EC = 60°, and arc CF = 360 - (arc FE + arc EC) = 360 - (118 + 60) = 182°, which is not among the choices. 

Alternatively, if angle EFB intercepts arc CF, then arc CF = 60°, which is not among the choices either. 

Wait, but the answer choices include 44 and 108. 108 is the measure of arc AB. Maybe there's a relationship between arc AB and arc CF. 

Alternatively, since arc AB is 108° on the larger circle, and arc EB is 104°, maybe arc AE is 4°, as previously calculated. Then, if there's a relationship between arc AE and arc CF on the smaller circle. But I don't see it.

Alternatively, since angle EGB is 52°, which is on the larger circle, and arc EB is 104°, and angle EFB is 30°, which might relate to some other arc on the smaller circle. 

Wait, if we consider the smaller circle, and point G is on it. So, since G is on the smaller circle, and line GE is an angle bisector, perhaps there's some relationship between arcs on the smaller circle. 

For example, if GE bisects angle EFB, and G is on the smaller circle, then maybe the arc EG and arc GF are related. But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: since GE bisects angle EFB, which is 30°, creating two 15° angles. If we consider the inscribed angles at G. For example, angle EGF would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF. But angle EGF is part of the larger diagram. 

Wait, if angle EGF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, then angle EGF = ½ arc EF. But we don't know angle EGF. However, if we can express it in terms of other angles. 

Alternatively, since G is on both circles, maybe there's a relationship between the arcs on both circles. For example, arc EB on the larger circle is 104°, and arc EF on the smaller circle is 118°. 

But I'm not seeing a direct connection. 

At this point, I think I've exhausted most approaches and am stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should revisit the initial contradiction. 

The problem states that m arc FE = 118°, and m angle EFB = 30°, which is an inscribed angle. If angle EFB intercepts arc FE, then arc FE should be 60°, but it's given as 118°. This suggests that the angle EFB intercepts the arc that is supplementary to arc FE. For example, if the angle intercepts the arc that is the rest of the circle, 360 - 118 = 242°, then the angle would be half of that, which is 121°, which doesn't match. 

Alternatively, if the angle intercepts the arc that is the supplement of arc FE. For example, if arc FE is 118°, then the remaining arc is 360 - 118 = 242°, and if the angle intercepts the remaining arc, then angle EFB would be half of 242°, which is 121°, still not matching 30°. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, or I'm missing a key insight. 

Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but a central angle? But no, because the vertex is on the circle. 

Wait, but if the angle is at F, which is on the circle, and the sides of the angle are FE and FB, then it's an inscribed angle. But if point B is outside the circle, then the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, or two secants? 

Wait, if point B is outside the circle, then angle EFB is formed by two secants: FE and FB. In that case, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Yes! This is the key. If the vertex of the angle is outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

So, if angle EFB is formed by two secants FE and FB, with F on the circle and B outside, then the measure of angle EFB is ½ (measure of arc FE - measure of arc FB). Wait, no, it's ½ (difference of the intercepted arcs). 

Specifically, the formula is: the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting at a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, in this case, angle EFB is formed by secants FE and FB, with F on the circle and B outside. So the angle is ½ (measure of arc FB - measure of arc FE). Wait, no, it's ½ (measure of the intercepted arc farthest from B minus the intercepted arc closest to B). 

Let me recall the exact formula: if two secants intersect at a point outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, if the angle is at point F, and the secants are FE and FB, then the intercepted arcs are the arc between E and B that doesn't contain F, and the arc between E and B that contains F. Wait, no. Actually, it's the difference between the intercepted arcs that are opposite the angle. 

Wait, the angle is formed by two secants: one is FE (from F to E on the circle), and the other is FB (from F to B outside the circle). So the intercepted arcs are the arc from E to B that does not pass through F (let's call it arc EB), and the arc from E to B that passes through F (which would be the arc going the long way around the circle). 

Wait, but since F is on the circle, the secant FB goes from F to B, and FE goes from F to E. So the angle at F is formed by FE and FB, with F on the circle. This is a bit ambiguous. 

Actually, when the vertex is on the circle, it's an inscribed angle. But if the vertex is outside, it's an external angle. Here, the vertex is on the circle, so it's an inscribed angle. But earlier calculation suggests that it should intercept arc EB, but the given arc FE is 118°. 

Wait, this brings us back to the original problem. If angle EFB is an inscribed angle, then it should intercept arc EB. But if arc EB is not given, but arc FE is, perhaps we can relate them. 

Let me assume that angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB on the smaller circle. Then, angle EFB = ½ arc EB. Given angle EFB is 30°, so arc EB = 60°. 

Now, on the smaller circle, we have arc FE = 118°, and arc EB = 60°. To find arc CF, we need to know the total circumference. If points C, E, F are on the smaller circle, then the arcs between them are CF, FE, and EC. 

Assuming the points are arranged in the order C-E-F-C, then the arcs would be CF, FE, and EC. Total is 360°. So arc CF + arc FE + arc EC = 360°. 

We know arc FE = 118°, and arc EC is what? If arc EB is 60°, and point B is outside the circle, then arc EB on the smaller circle is 60°, but how does that relate to arc EC? 

If points E, B, and C are on the smaller circle, but B is not on it, so arc EB is not on the smaller circle. Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, if arc EB on the smaller circle is 60°, and arc FE is 118°, then the remaining arc would be arc EC. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but if arc EB is 60°, and arc FE is 118°, and assuming that point C is somewhere on the circle, then arc CF would be part of the circle. If we can find arc EC, then arc CF = 360 - (arc FE + arc EC). 

But how to find arc EC? 

Maybe there's a relationship between arc EB on the smaller circle and arc AB on the larger circle. Since point G is on both circles, and arc EB on the larger circle is 104°, and arc EB on the smaller circle is 60°. But I don't see how to connect these. 

Alternatively, since G is on both circles, and GE is the angle bisector, maybe there's some relationship between arcs on both circles. 

This is taking too long, and I need to make an educated guess based on the given answer choices. 

Given that arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and the answer choices include 44, which is 118 - 74, or 108 - 64. Not sure. 

Alternatively, if angle EFB is 30°, and it's an external angle, then it would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let's try that. Assume that angle EFB is formed by two secants: FE and FB, with F on the circle and B outside. Then, the measure of angle EFB is ½ (arc FB - arc FE). But we don't know arc FB. 

But if we assume that arc FB is the arc from F to B passing through C, and arc FE is 118°, then angle EFB = ½ (arc FB - arc FE). Given angle EFB is 30°, so 30 = ½ (arc FB - 118), so arc FB - 118 = 60 → arc FB = 178°. 

Then, arc FB = 178°. But how does this help? If we can relate arc FB to other arcs. 

On the smaller circle, arc FB is 178°, and arc FE is 118°. If points C, E, F are on the circle, then arc CF would be part of the circle. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if arc FB is 178°, and arc FE is 118°, then arc EB (the arc from E to B passing through F) is 118°, and the other arc from E to B is 360 - 178 = 182°. But I don't know. 

This is too speculative. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to pick an answer based on the given choices and the arc FE = 118°. 

If arc CF is the same as arc FE, it would be 118°, which is choice D. But that's already given as arc FE. 

Alternatively, since angle EFB is 30°, and it's related to arc CF, maybe arc CF is 60°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, if arc CF is 44°, then 44 is a plausible answer. Why? Let me think. 

If arc FE is 118°, and arc CF is x, then the total circle is 360°. If there's another arc, say arc EC, then x + 118 + arc EC = 360. But without knowing arc EC, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if angle EGB is 52°, which is half of arc EB on the larger circle (104°), and arc AB is 108°, maybe there's a relationship between arc AB and arc CF. 

If arc AB is 108°, and arc CF is 44°, then 108 - 44 = 64, which doesn't mean much. 

Alternatively, since angle EFB is 30°, and it's related to arc CF. If angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle, then arc CF = 60°, but not an option. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 30, B. 44, C. 108, D. 118. 

If arc CF is 44°, then it could be 118° - 74°, but I don't know. 

Alternatively, since arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and angle EGB is 52°, which is half of 104°, maybe there's a relationship between arc CF and arc AB. 

If arc CF is 44°, then it could be 108° - 64°, but this is arbitrary. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the most plausible answer based on the given arc FE = 118° and the presence of 44 as an option, I'll choose B. 44. But I'm not confident. 

Wait, another approach: if angle EFB is 30°, and it's formed by two secants, then it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let's assume that. 

So, angle EFB = ½ (arc FB - arc FE) = 30°. 

So, arc FB - arc FE = 60°. 

Given arc FE = 118°, then arc FB = 118° + 60° = 178°. 

Now, on the smaller circle, arc FB is 178°, and arc FE is 118°. If points C, E, F are on the circle, then arc CF would be part of the circle. 

Assuming the points are arranged as C, F, E, and then B is somewhere. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. 

But if arc FB is 178°, and arc FE is 118°, then the arc from F to B passing through E is 118°, and the arc from F to B passing through C is 178°. So, the arc from E to C would be 178° - 118° = 60°. 

Therefore, arc EC = 60°. 

Now, the total circumference is 360°, so arc CF + arc FE + arc EC = 36
