Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information. There are several points and lines mentioned, along with various angles and their measures. The goal is to find the measure of angle 7, given that angle 4 equals angle 5. 

Starting with STEP 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup. Let me list out all the given data. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(C,G), Line(F,B), Line(E,B), Line(A,B), Line(D,B), Line(F,C), Line(E,A). Also, some triangles: Triangle(F,B,C), Triangle(E,B,A), Triangle(D,B,C), Triangle(A,B,G). Angles mentioned include Angle(F), Angle(E), Angle(CAB), Angle(GAB), Angle(CBF), and then angles labeled 1 to 7. Some equality and congruence relations are given. For example, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F)), 63), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(CAB)), 47), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GAB)), 136). Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), Sub(136, 47)) which would be 136 - 47 = 89. Similarly, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), Sub(69, 63)) so that's 6. Then there's Congruent(Angle(4), Angle(5)), LinearPair(Angle(GAB), Angle(CAB)), ExteriorAngle(Angle(CBF), Triangle(F,B,C)), and SumOfAngles(Triangle(E,B,A), SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)))).

So, the question is about finding measure of angle 7, given that angle 4 equals angle 5. Let me note down the known measures first. From the given:

Measure of Angle(F) is 63 degrees. That's one angle. Then Angle(CAB) is 47 degrees. Angle(GAB) is 136 degrees. Then Angle(CBF) is 69 degrees. Then Angle(1) is 136 - 47 = 89. Angle(2) is 69 - 63 = 6. 

Now, looking at the other predicates. The LinearPair(Angle(GAB), Angle(CAB)) implies that these two angles form a straight line, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Let me check: 136 + 47 = 183? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, LinearPair means they are adjacent and supplementary. So if Angle(GAB) and Angle(CAB) are a linear pair, their sum should be 180 degrees. But according to the given measures, Angle(GAB) is 136 and Angle(CAB) is 47. Adding them gives 183, which isn't 180. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the configuration?

Wait, but maybe those angles aren't directly adjacent. Wait, the LinearPair(Angle(GAB), Angle(CAB)) suggests that they are adjacent forming a straight line. But if that's the case, their measures should add up to 180. However, according to the given measures, 136 + 47 = 183, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Alternatively, maybe the labels are different. Let me think again. Let me visualize the diagram. 

Points involved: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Lines: AB connects A and B; E connected to B, F connected to B, D connected to B, C connected to G. Also, F connected to C, E connected to A. Triangles: Triangle(F,B,C) has vertices F, B, C. Triangle(E,B,A) has E, B, A. Triangle(D,B,C) has D, B, C. Triangle(A,B,G) has A, B, G. 

Also, Angle(CAB) is at point A, between CA and AB. Wait, CAB is angle at A? No, angle CAB is the angle at point A between points C, A, B. Wait, no, angle CAB is formed at point A? Wait, CAB is angle at point A? Wait, standard notation: angle CAB is the angle at point A between points C and B. So vertex at A, with segments AC and AB. 

Similarly, angle GAB is the angle at point A between GA and AB. So if we have points G connected to A via line AG (since Line(A,B,G)? Wait, the line is Line(A,B,G)? Wait, original predicates say Line(A,B) and Line(A,B,G)? Wait, no. Looking back, Line(C,G), Line(F,B), Line(E,B), Line(A,B), Line(D,B), Line(F,C), Line(E,A). So Line(A,B) is a line connecting A and B. Then, Line(E,A) connects E and A. So E is connected to A. Line(F,C) connects F and C. Line(C,G) connects C and G. So the triangle A,B,G would involve points A, B, G connected by lines AB, BG, and AG? Not sure yet. 

But going back to the linear pair. If Angle(GAB) and Angle(CAB) are a linear pair, then they must be adjacent angles forming a straight line. So that would mean that the sides of these angles form a straight line. So, if angle GAB is at point A between GA and AB, and angle CAB is at point A between CA and AB, then combining them would require that GA and CA are opposite rays, making a straight line. So GA and CA would be in a straight line, implying that points G, A, and C are colinear. But wait, if that's the case, then line GC passes through A. But according to the given lines, there's a line CG (Line(C,G)), which would be the same as line GC. So if point A lies on line CG, then yes, that would make sense. But how do we know that?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since angle GAB and angle CAB are a linear pair, their measures should add up to 180. Given that angle GAB is 136 degrees and angle CAB is 47 degrees, adding them gives 183, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the given measures are conflicting, or there's a misunderstanding in the configuration. Wait, but the problem says that these are the given predicates, so maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me re-examine the given measures. 

Looking back: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(GAB)), 136). And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(CAB)), 47). So these are fixed. Then the LinearPair(Angle(GAB), Angle(CAB)) implies that their sum is 180. But 136+47=183, which contradicts. This suggests that there's an inconsistency unless there's a typo in the problem statement. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the angles. 

Wait, could it be that Angle(GAB) is not at point A? Wait, no. In standard notation, angle GAB is at point A. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle GAB is at point A, between points G, A, B. Similarly, angle CAB is at point A between points C, A, B. Therefore, if they are a linear pair, then the two angles must form a straight line. Which would imply that GA and CA are in a straight line, hence points G, A, C are colinear. Therefore, line GC passes through A. But in the given lines, Line(C,G) exists. So point A lying on line CG. Therefore, line CG passes through A. Hence, point A is on line CG. 

But then, how does that affect the rest of the problem? Let me proceed. 

Next, the exterior angle. ExteriorAngle(Angle(CBF), Triangle(F,B,C)). So angle CBF is an exterior angle to triangle FBC. Therefore, by the exterior angle theorem, the measure of angle CBF is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. In triangle FBC, the exterior angle at B (which is angle CBF) would be equal to the sum of the angles at F and C. Wait, but the triangle is F, B, C. So the exterior angle at B would be equal to the sum of angles at F and C. 

Given that angle CBF is 69 degrees. So, if we can find the measures of angles at F and C in triangle FBC, then their sum would be 69. 

But also, there's a triangle FBC, so the sum of its internal angles is 180. So angle at B (CBF) plus angles at F and C equals 180. Wait, but angle CBF is the exterior angle, so actually, the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Therefore, angle CBF = angle at F (of triangle FBC) + angle at C (of triangle FBC). 

Let me denote angle at F as angle BFC and angle at C as angle BCF. Then angle CBF (exterior) = angle BFC + angle BCF. 

But we don't know these angles yet. However, we might be able to relate them through other parts of the problem. 

Additionally, there's the triangle EBA (Triangle(E,B,A)). The sum of its angles is given by SumOfAngles(Triangle(E,B,A), SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)))). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, this implies that MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(4)) + MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 180. But also, it's stated that Congruent(Angle(4), Angle(5)), so angle 4 and angle 5 have equal measures. Let's call each x. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + x + x = 180 => MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + 2x = 180. 

But we need more info to find x. Let's see where else angles 4 and 5 come into play. 

Looking back, the angles labeled 1 and 2 were defined. Angle(1) was Sub(136, 47) = 89, and Angle(2) was Sub(69, 63) = 6. These might be part of other triangles or relationships. 

Also, considering the triangle FBC. Let me try to find the angles in triangle FBC. We know angle CBF is 69 degrees (given as the exterior angle). But in triangle FBC, the sum of angles is 180. So angle at B (which is angle FBC?), wait, no. Wait, triangle FBC has vertices F, B, C. So the angles are at F, B, and C. The exterior angle at B is angle CBF. Wait, the exterior angle would be outside the triangle. So if we consider triangle FBC, and extend one of the sides to form an exterior angle. For instance, extending side BC beyond C, but I need to clarify. 

Actually, the exterior angle at B would be formed by extending one of the sides adjacent to B. For example, if we extend side BF beyond B, then the exterior angle would be adjacent to angle at B. Wait, perhaps I need to draw this mentally. 

In triangle FBC, the angle at B is angle FBC. An exterior angle at B would be formed by extending side FB or CB. Suppose we extend side FC beyond C, creating an exterior angle. Wait, maybe it's better to use the definition: the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. So angle CBF (the given exterior angle) is equal to the sum of angles at F and C of triangle FBC. 

Therefore, angle CBF = angle BFC + angle BCF. 

But without knowing those angles, we can't directly compute. However, maybe there are other relationships. 

Let me look at other parts. For example, in triangle EBA (Triangle(E,B,A)), we have angles at E, B, and A. Wait, but we know that Angle(E) is part of the sum. Also, there's a line EA (from earlier, Line(E,A)), and line AB. So triangle EBA has points E, B, A. 

Additionally, there's a line EB (Line(E,B)), which is part of triangle EBA. Also, there's line EA. 

Another thing is that angle CAB is 47 degrees, which is part of triangle EBA? Wait, angle CAB is at point A between CA and AB. So if point C is connected to A? Wait, line CA is part of triangle CAB? But I need to check connections. 

Earlier, Line(C,G) exists, and Line(E,A) exists. Also, Line(F,C) exists. So point C is connected to F and G. Point A is connected to B and E. 

Wait, maybe there's a connection between triangle EBA and other elements. Also, angle CAB (at A) is 47 degrees, and angle GAB is 136 degrees. Earlier confusion about the linear pair. But perhaps there's a way to resolve that. 

Since angle GAB and angle CAB are supposed to be a linear pair, adding to 180. Their measures are 136 and 47, totaling 183. This contradiction suggests that there's a miscalculation or misunderstanding. Perhaps the angles are not both at point A? Wait, no. Both angles are at point A. So unless there's another angle at point A contributing. Wait, maybe angle GAB is not the entire angle? Or perhaps there's another angle involved. 

Wait, if points G, A, and C are colinear, then angle GAC would be a straight line. But angle CAB is at A between CA and AB. If CA is extended past A to G, then angle between GA and AB would be angle GAB. So if CA and GA are in a straight line, then angle between CA and GA is 180, but angle CAB is between CA and AB. So angle CAB and angle GAB would be adjacent angles at point A, forming a larger angle. Wait, but if GA and CA are in a straight line, then the total angle around point A would be angle CAB + angle GAB = 47 + 136 = 183, which exceeds 180. This is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the linear pair refers to different angles. Let me check the original predicate: LinearPair(Angle(GAB), Angle(CAB)). So the two angles are a linear pair, meaning they form a straight line. Thus, their sum must be 180. But according to given measures, they sum to 183. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the measures given are incorrect, but since the problem states these as given, I must reconcile this. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem. For example, perhaps Angle(CAB) is not 47, but another value? Or perhaps Angle(GAB) is different. But since the user has provided the given data, I have to work with it. 

Alternatively, maybe angle CAB and angle GAB are not both at point A. Wait, no, because the notation Angle(CAB) is at A, and Angle(GAB) is also at A. Therefore, they are adjacent angles at point A. Hence, their sum should be 180. But the given measures don't satisfy this. Therefore, there's a conflict. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem's setup. But since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I need to assume that the given measures are correct, and find a way to proceed despite this contradiction. Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angles. 

Wait, maybe angle GAB is not at point A. Wait, no. The notation Angle(GAB) is angle at point A between points G, A, B. So vertex at A. Similarly, Angle(CAB) is at point A. Therefore, they are adjacent angles at point A. Therefore, their sum must be 180. But the given measures don't support this. Therefore, there must be an error. However, since this is a problem to solve, perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere. 

Let me set aside this issue for a moment and look for other clues. 

We have the exterior angle at angle CBF (69 degrees) being equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. So, in triangle FBC, angle CBF is an exterior angle, so it's equal to angle BFC + angle BCF. 

Then, the sum of angles in triangle FBC is angle FBC + angle BFC + angle BCF = 180. But angle FBC is the interior angle at B, and angle CBF is the exterior angle. Wait, no. Wait, the exterior angle at B would be adjacent to angle FBC. Let me clarify. 

If we consider triangle FBC, and extend side BC beyond C to a point, forming an exterior angle at C. Or extend side BF beyond F. Wait, the exterior angle at B would be formed by extending one of the sides meeting at B. For example, if we extend side BF beyond F, then the exterior angle would be adjacent to angle FBC. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me recall the exterior angle theorem: the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 

So, if angle CBF is the exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles of triangle FBC. Those remote interior angles would be at F and C. Therefore, angle CBF = angle BFC + angle BCF. 

So, if I can find angle BFC or angle BCF, I can relate them. 

But how? Let's think about other triangles. For example, triangle AGB? Or triangle ABC? 

Wait, there's a triangle A,B,G. So triangle ABG. Points A, B, G. Let me check if that triangle exists. Yes, Line(A,B) and Line(A,B,G) — wait, the line CG is present, and point A is connected to B. Also, point G is connected to C. So point A is connected to B, and point G is connected to C. Not sure if triangle ABG exists. 

But angle GAB is 136 degrees, which is part of triangle ABG. Wait, in triangle ABG, angle at A is 136 degrees. But also, angle CAB is 47 degrees. If points C, A, G are colinear, then angle CAB and angle GAB would be supplementary. But that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express angle GAB in terms of other angles. For example, if there's a triangle involving point G. 

Alternatively, focusing on the triangle EBA. The sum of its angles is MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(4)) + MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 180. And since angle 4 and 5 are congruent, each is x, so MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 180 - 2x. 

If I can find MeasureOf(Angle(E)), then I can find x. How? 

Perhaps angle E is part of another triangle. For example, in triangle EBA, angle at E is Angle(E). What else involves point E? Line(E,A) and Line(E,B), so triangle EBA. Also, there's triangle EBA and possibly others. 

Wait, there's also triangle E,B,A and triangle E,B,F? Or other connections. 

Alternatively, looking at the given angle measures. We have Angle(F) is 63 degrees. Is Angle(F) referring to an angle in triangle FBC? Because in the given predicates, there's Angle(F), which might be angle at F in triangle FBC. 

Assuming that Angle(F) is angle at F in triangle FBC. So in triangle FBC, angle at F is 63 degrees. Then, since angle CBF is 69 degrees (exterior angle), and angle at F is 63 degrees, then according to the exterior angle theorem, angle CBF = angle BFC + angle BCF. But angle BFC is angle at F, which is 63 degrees. So angle CBF = 63 + angle BCF → 69 = 63 + angle BCF → angle BCF = 6 degrees. 

So angle BCF is 6 degrees. 

Then, in triangle FBC, angles at F, B, and C are 63°, ?, and 6° respectively. Wait, but angle at B in triangle FBC is angle FBC, which is the interior angle. Wait, but earlier we said that angle CBF is the exterior angle. Wait, if angle CBF is an exterior angle at B, then the interior angle at B would be supplementary to angle CBF. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

If angle CBF is an exterior angle at B, then it's adjacent to the interior angle at B. So, the exterior angle CBF and the interior angle at B are supplementary. So, interior angle at B (let's call it y) + exterior angle CBF = 180. So y = 180 - CBF = 180 - 69 = 111 degrees. 

Thus, in triangle FBC, angles are: at F: 63°, at B: 111°, at C: 6°. Check sum: 63 + 111 + 6 = 180. Correct. 

So angle at C (angle BCF) is 6 degrees. 

Now, moving to triangle EBA. We have MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + 2x = 180, where x is MeasureOf(Angle(4)) and MeasureOf(Angle(5)). 

What is angle E? It's part of triangle EBA. Let me think. In triangle EBA, the angles are at E, B, and A. We know angle at A is angle EAB. Wait, angle EAB is part of the given angles? 

Wait, angle EAB would be the angle at A between E and B. But earlier, we had angle CAB (at A between C and B) is 47 degrees, and angle GAB (at A between G and B) is 136 degrees. Are these related to angle EAB? 

Yes! Because line EA connects E and A, and line AB connects A and B. So angle EAB is the angle at A between E and B. So this is part of triangle EBA. 

But how does this relate to the other angles? 

Let me think. At point A, there are several angles. We have angle CAB (between C and B) = 47°, angle EAB (between E and B), and angle GAB (between G and B) = 136°. 

If these angles are arranged around point A, their sum might relate to the full rotation. However, since we're dealing with planar geometry, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. But unless they are adjacent, we can't directly sum them. 

But if points C, E, G are positioned such that lines from A go to C, E, G, then the angles between these lines would sum accordingly. 

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. But maybe there's a relationship between angle EAB and other angles. 

For example, angle EAB is part of triangle EBA. In triangle EBA, the angles are at E, B, and A. We have angle at A (EAB), angle at B (which is angle EBA), and angle at E. 

But how do we find these angles? 

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle EBA, angle at B is angle EBA. Is there a way to find that? 

Looking back at other lines: Line(E,B) is present, so point E is connected to B. Line(E,A) connects E to A. So in triangle EBA, sides are EB, BA, and AE. 

Now, if I can find angle at B (angle EBA), then I can use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle EBA is 180. 

But how to find angle EBA? 

Maybe through other triangles or relationships. For instance, if there are other lines or triangles involving point B. 

Point B is connected to multiple points: A, C, D, E, F. 

Looking at triangle DBC (Triangle(D,B,C)): points D, B, C. So angle at B would be angle DBC. 

But not sure yet. 

Alternatively, thinking about angle at B in triangle EBA. Let me consider that angle EBA is part of other structures. For example, point B is connected to D, E, F, and C. 

But without more information, it's challenging. Let me think about the given angles again. 

We have Angle(1) = 89°, which is Sub(136, 47) = 89. Where does this angle come from? Possibly as part of another triangle. 

Similarly, Angle(2) is 6°, which is Sub(69, 63) = 6. 

These might be angles within certain triangles. For example, Angle(1) could be an angle in triangle EBA or another triangle. 

Let me try to explore Angle(1): 89°. Given that it's Sub(136, 47), which is 136 - 47. These numbers are the measures of Angle(GAB) and Angle(CAB). So 136 - 47 = 89. Perhaps this represents an angle formed by subtracting two angles. For example, if there's a triangle where angle is the difference between Angle(GAB) and Angle(CAB). 

But how? If angle GAB is 136°, and angle CAB is 47°, and they are adjacent at point A, then the difference could represent an angle between GA and CA. But since they are a linear pair, their sum should be 180, but they add to 183, suggesting that there's an extra angle somewhere. 

Wait, perhaps there's another angle at point A. Like, if there's a triangle involving point A, G, and C, then angle at A would be split into angle CAB and angle GAB. But that would require that GA and CA are on opposite sides of AB, leading to angle CAB + angle GAB = angle between GA and CA, which would be 183°, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an external angle or part of another structure. 

Alternatively, Angle(1) could be part of triangle EBA. For example, if angle EAB is 89°, then Angle(1) is 89°. But why would that be? 

Let me consider that in triangle EBA, angle at A is angle EAB. If this is equal to Angle(1) = 89°, then that would fit. But why? 

Because Angle(GAB) is 136°, and Angle(CAB) is 47°, and if angle EAB is the difference between them, like 136 - 47 = 89°, then that could explain Angle(1). 

But how would angle EAB relate to these two angles? 

Suppose that at point A, there are three lines: AB, AC, and AE. If angle between GA and AB is 136°, and angle between CA and AB is 47°, then depending on the position of E, angle EAB could be the difference. 

For example, if line AE is such that it forms an angle with AB that is the difference between 136° and 47°, then angle EAB = 89°. This would make sense. 

Assuming that, then in triangle EBA, angle at A is 89°, which is Angle(1). 

Then, in triangle EBA, the angles are: at A: 89°, at B: let's call it y, and at E: z. So 89 + y + z = 180 → y + z = 91. 

But also, from the SumOfAngles predicate, MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(4)) + MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 180. And since angle 4 and 5 are congruent, each is x. So MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + 2x = 180. 

If angle at E is z, then MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = z. So z + 2x = 180. 

But we also have y + z = 91. 

So we need to find y and z. How? 

Possibly, angle y (at B in triangle EBA) relates to other angles. For example, angle at B in triangle EBA is angle EBA. Is there a relation between angle EBA and other angles? 

Point B is connected to multiple points: A, C, D, E, F. 

In particular, line BE is part of triangle EBA, and line BF is part of triangle FBC. 

Wait, in triangle FBC, we found that angle at B (interior) is 111°, which is angle FBC. So angle FBC is 111°. 

But angle EBA is another angle at point B. How are these related? 

If lines BE and BF are connected at point B, then the angle between them would be angle EBF. But unless we know more about the configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, if angle EBA is part of a larger angle at point B. 

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging. However, we might find another way. 

Let me recap what I have:

From triangle FBC, angle at B (interior) is 111°, angle at F is 63°, angle at C is 6°.

From triangle EBA, angles at A: 89°, at B: y, at E: z. With y + z = 91.

And from the SumOfAngles predicate: z + 2x = 180.

But I need to connect these variables. 

Is there a way to relate x to other angles? 

Angle 4 and 5 are congruent. What are these angles? The problem mentions angles labeled 1 through 7. We already have angle 1 = 89°, angle 2 = 6°, and we need to find angle 7. 

But where are angles 4 and 5 located? The predicate says SumOfAngles(Triangle(E,B,A), SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)))). So angle 4 and 5 are part of triangle EBA. 

Wait, the sum of the angles in triangle EBA is MeasureOf(Angle(E)) + MeasureOf(Angle(4)) + MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 180. So angle(E), angle(4), and angle(5) are the three angles of triangle EBA. But we already assumed that angle at A is 89°, which could be one of these. 

But if angle(E) is one of the angles, and angle(4) and angle(5) are the other two, then:

Case 1: angle(E) is at E, angle(4) and angle(5) are at B and A. 

Or Case 2: angle(4) and angle(5) are at B and E, with angle(E) at A. 

But we need to determine which. 

Assuming that angle(E) is at E, and angle(4) and angle(5) are at B and A. But angle at A is 89°, which might be one of them. 

But since angle(4) and angle(5) are congruent, they must be equal. 

So if angle at A is 89°, and it's one of angle(4) or angle(5), then the other would be at B. But since angle(4) and angle(5) are congruent, if angle at A is 89°, then angle at B would also be 89°, making the third angle at E = 180 - 89 - 89 = 2°. But then the sum would be 89 + 89 + 2 = 180. But this would mean angle(E) is 2°, and angles 4 and 5 are 89° each. 

But then, from the earlier equation z + 2x = 180, where z is angle(E) and x is angle(4) and angle(5). So if z is 2°, then 2 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 178 → x = 89°. Which fits with angle(4) and angle(5) being 89°. 

But how does this fit with the other information? 

If angle at B in triangle EBA is 89°, then angle EBA is 89°. But earlier, we had angle FBC = 111°, which is the interior angle at B in triangle FBC. So if angle at B in triangle EBA is 89°, and angle FBC is 111°, then what's the relationship between them? 

At point B, there are multiple angles: angle EBA (89°), angle FBC (111°), and possibly others. Depending on the configuration, these could be adjacent or part of larger angles. 

For example, if line BE and BF are on opposite sides of line BC, then the total angle at B could be the sum of these. But without a diagram, it's tricky. 

However, assuming that angle EBA is 89°, and angle FBC is 111°, then the sum of these two angles at point B would be 89 + 111 = 200°, which is greater than 180, implying that they are not adjacent. This suggests that there's another angle at point B. 

But perhaps angle EBA and angle FBC are separate angles at B, and together with other angles, they form the total around point B. 

However, without more information, this might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, if angle at B in triangle EBA is 89°, and angle at B in triangle FBC is 111°, then these could be separate angles at point B, and the total would depend on how the lines are arranged. 

But regardless, proceeding with the assumption that angle(E) is 2°, and angles 4 and 5 are 89° each, then x = 89°. 

But then, what is angle 7? The question asks for the measure of angle 7. 

Wait, but where is angle 7? The problem mentions angles 1 through 7, with angles 1 and 2 already defined. 

The given angles are: Angle(F)=63°, Angle(E) is part of triangle EBA, Angle(CAB)=47°, Angle(GAB)=136°, Angle(CBF)=69°, Angle(1)=89°, Angle(2)=6°, and then angles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

But the problem says "Find the measure of ∠7 if m∠4 = m∠5." 

So, angle 4 and angle 5 are congruent, and we've deduced that they are each 89°, based on the previous calculation. 

But how does this relate to angle 7? 

Perhaps angle 7 is related to other angles. Let me review the given predicates. 

There are several angles listed: Angle(F), Angle(E), Angle(CAB), Angle(GAB), Angle(CBF), and then angles 1 through 7. 

We've used angles 1 and 2. Now, angle 4 and 5 are part of triangle EBA. 

What about angle 3, 6, 7? 

The problem doesn't give direct information about angles 3, 6, or 7, except for angle 4 and 5. 

Wait, but perhaps angle 7 is the remaining angle in some triangle or structure. 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be related to the sum of angles in another triangle. 

Let me think about the other angles. 

We have angle at C in triangle FBC is 6°, which was angle BCF. 

Is there a triangle involving point C and other points where this angle could be part of? 

For example, triangle C, B, G? Line(CG) is present, and point B is connected to C. So triangle BCG? 

In triangle BCG, we have points B, C, G. 

If we can find angles in this triangle, perhaps we can relate them. 

But we know angle at C is 6° (angle BCF, which is part of triangle FBC). If line CG is part of this triangle, then angle at C would be angle BCG. 

Wait, if line CG is present, then in triangle BCG, angle at C is angle BCG. But we previously determined that angle BCF is 6°, which is part of triangle FBC. If point F is on line CF, then angle BCF is part of line CF. 

But how does this relate to angle BCG? If line CG passes through A, as per the earlier thought, then point A is on line CG. So line CG goes through A, and thus, angle at C between B and G would be angle BCG. 

If angle BCG is part of triangle BCG, then we can find other angles. 

But to do this, we need more information. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ABG. Points A, B, G. We know angle at A is 136° (angle GAB). If we can find other angles in this triangle, we can find the third angle. 

But what about the other angles? Let's see. 

In triangle ABG, angles are at A, B, and G. 

Angle at A is 136°, as given. 

Angle at B is angle ABG. 

Angle at G is angle AGB. 

Sum of angles is 180°, so angle ABG + angle AGB = 180 - 136 = 44°. 

But without knowing more, it's difficult to proceed. 

However, if we can find angle ABG, it might relate to other angles. 

Angle ABG is at point B, between A and G. 

But point B is connected to multiple lines: to A, C, D, E, F. 

If we can find angle ABG, it might be related to angle FBC or other angles. 

But this seems too vague. 

Let me return to the earlier assumption where angle 4 and 5 are each 89°, leading to angle(E) being 2°. 

But then, what about angle 7? 

The problem asks for angle 7, but there's no direct information about it. Unless angle 7 is part of another triangle or structure. 

Wait, the given angles include Angle(1) through Angle(7). We have used angles 1, 2, 4, 5. What about angles 3, 6, 7? 

Maybe angle 3 is related to angle 2. For example, angle 2 is 6°, which came from Sub(69, 63). This might be part of triangle FBC. 

In triangle FBC, we have angle at F: 63°, angle at B: 111°, angle at C: 6°. 

So angle at C is 6°, which is angle BCF. 

This might be angle 2, since it's 6°. 

If angle 2 is 6°, which is angle BCF, then angle 3 could be something else. 

But without explicit information, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, angle 7 might be the remaining angle in some triangle. 

Alternatively, if angle 7 is the third angle in triangle FBC, but that's already covered. 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be related to angle at G in some triangle. 

But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, since angle 4 and 5 are each 89°, and we need to find angle 7, maybe angle 7 is the supplement or complement of some angle. 

Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be the sum of angles 4 and 5, but that would be 178°, which isn't among the options. 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be related to the exterior angles or other relationships. 

But this is speculative. 

Wait, let's revisit the initial assumption about the angles at point A. Even though the sum of angle GAB and CAB is 183°, which is impossible, maybe there's a different interpretation. 

Maybe the linear pair is not between angle GAB and CAB, but between other angles. Or perhaps the given measures are incorrect, and there's a typo. For example, if angle GAB is 89° instead of 136°, then the sum would be 89 + 47 = 136, which is still not 180. 

Alternatively, if angle CAB is 43° instead of 47°, then 136 + 43 = 179, close to 180. But this is speculation. 

However, since the problem states these measures, I have to work with them. 

Given the contradictions, perhaps the key is to focus on the parts that are consistent. 

We've determined that in triangle FBC, angles are 63°, 111°, and 6°. 

In triangle EBA, angles are 89°, y, z, with y + z = 91°. And from the SumOfAngles predicate, z + 2x = 180, where x is angle 4 and 5. 

If angle at A is 89°, then x could be 89°, making z = 180 - 2*89 = 180 - 178 = 2°. 

So angle at E is 2°, and angles 4 and 5 are 89° each. 

Now, what about angle 7? It's not directly mentioned, but maybe it's related to angle at E, which is 2°, or another angle. 

Alternatively, if angle 7 is the remaining angle in another triangle. 

For example, in triangle EBA, if angle at E is 2°, and angle at B is 89°, then angle at A is 89°, as before. 

But how does this help us find angle 7? 

Wait, maybe angle 7 is the exterior angle related to triangle EBA. Or perhaps it's part of another triangle. 

Alternatively, considering that angle 4 and angle 5 are each 89°, and angle 7 is the third angle in some other triangle. 

Wait, the problem says "if m∠4 = m∠5," which we've already used to get x = 89°. But what about angle 7? 

Perhaps angle 7 is the supplement of angle 2 (6°), giving 174°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be the sum of angle 1 and angle 2: 89 + 6 = 95°, not in options. 

Alternatively, angle 7 is the difference between angle 1 and angle 2: 89 - 6 = 83°, not an option. 

Alternatively, angle 7 could be angle at G in some triangle. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. 

Wait, maybe angle 7 is the third angle in triangle FBC, but that's already accounted for. 

Alternatively, angle 7 is the supplement of angle 4, which is 89°, giving 91°, but not in options. 

Alternatively, angle 7 is the sum of angle 4 and angle 2: 89 + 6 = 95°, still not matching. 

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps my earlier assumptions are incorrect. 

Let me reconsider. 

Earlier, I assumed that angle at A in triangle EBA is 89°, which comes from angle GAB - angle CAB = 89°. But if that leads to inconsistencies, perhaps angle at A is not 89°. 

Alternative approach: Let's forget about the linear pair for a moment and try to focus on the given information. 

We have angle CBF = 69°, which is an exterior angle to triangle FBC, so it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. As before, this gives angle at F (63°) + angle at C (6°) = 69°, making angle at B in triangle FBC = 111°. 

Now, in triangle EBA, the sum of angles is 180. Let's denote angle at E as e, at B as b, and at A as a. So e + b + a
