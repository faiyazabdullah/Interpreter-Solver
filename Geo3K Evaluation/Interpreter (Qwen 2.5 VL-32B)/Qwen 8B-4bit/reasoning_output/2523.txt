Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, and they're similar. We need to find the value of x based on some given length equations. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the given predicates mention several points and lines forming rectangles. For rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Similarly for EFGH. Also, there are lines connecting other points like AD, BE, CF, DG, etc. But maybe those lines are diagonals or something else? Wait, but since they're rectangles, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. 

Now, looking at the length equations. The first one says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), x). So AD has length x. Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)), 7.5). So DG is 7.5 units long. Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,G)), Add(x, 7.5)). That means AG is x + 7.5. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), 5), so BE is 5. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Sub(x, 2)), so BC is x minus 2. Additionally, the rectangles are similar, so their corresponding sides are proportional.

Since ABCD and EFGH are similar rectangles, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Let me recall that similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So if I can find the ratio between the sides of ABCD and EFGH, that ratio would be consistent across all pairs of corresponding sides.

But wait, how do I relate the sides here? Let me think about the structure of the rectangles. Let's consider rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, AB and CD are lengths, BC and AD are widths. Wait, actually, depending on the order of the points. Let me visualize ABCD as a rectangle where AB is adjacent to BC, so AB and BC are adjacent sides. Therefore, AB and CD are opposite sides (so same length), BC and AD are opposite sides (same length). Wait, no. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and BC equals AD. Wait, but according to the Line predicates, Line(A,B) is one side, Line(B,C) another, Line(C,D), Line(D,A). So AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. Therefore, AB and CD are opposite sides, so AB = CD. BC and DA are opposite sides, so BC = DA. So DA is one of the sides. Wait, but DA is connected to point D and A. Wait, the LengthOf(Line(A,D)) is x. So DA is x. Therefore, BC is also x because BC and DA are opposite sides. But the problem states that Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Sub(x, 2)). So BC = x - 2. But BC is equal to DA, which is x. Therefore, x - 2 = x? Wait, that doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here unless my understanding is wrong.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me re-examine. In rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, etc. Therefore, AB and CD are opposite sides, so AB = CD. BC and DA are opposite sides, so BC = DA. Therefore, DA is one of the sides. The LengthOf(Line(A,D)) is x, so DA is x. Hence, BC must also be x. However, the problem gives Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Sub(x, 2)), which is BC = x - 2. Therefore, combining these, x - 2 = x. Which leads to -2 = 0, which is impossible. That suggests that my assumption is incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, perhaps Line(B,C) is not a side of the rectangle but a diagonal? Wait, no. Because the rectangle's sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So BC is indeed a side. So if DA is a side of length x, then BC is also a side of length x. But according to the given, BC is x - 2. This seems conflicting. So maybe my initial assumption about which sides correspond is wrong? Or perhaps the way the lines are defined isn't just the sides? Let me check the given lines again.

Looking back: The lines listed are Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A) for rectangle ABCD. So those are the four sides. So BC is a side of the rectangle, hence its length is equal to DA. But according to the given, DA is x, and BC is x - 2. Therefore, that would mean x = x - 2 → 0 = -2, which is impossible. So this suggests that my interpretation of DA being a side is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe DA is a diagonal?

Wait, but the problem mentions Line(A,D), which is part of the rectangle's structure. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So DA is indeed a side. Unless the rectangle is labeled differently. Wait, could there be a mistake in the labeling of the rectangle? Like, maybe ABCD is not ordered sequentially? But typically, rectangles are named in order such that each consecutive pair forms a side. So A connected to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. So yes, DA is a side. Therefore, DA is a side of length x. Thus, BC is also a side of length x, but the problem says BC is x - 2. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the lines mentioned aren't just the sides. Let me check all the lines again. The given lines include Line(A,D), Line(B,E), Line(C,F), Line(D,G), etc. These might not all be sides of the rectangles. For example, Line(A,D) could be a diagonal of the rectangle. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the diagonals are AC and BD. So Line(A,D) is a side, not a diagonal. Wait, because A is connected to D directly. So if the rectangle is ABCD, then points A, B, C, D form a rectangle with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Therefore, Line(A,D) is a side. So DA is a side of length x. Therefore, BC is also a side of length x. But according to the problem, Line(B,C) has length x - 2. So x = x - 2? That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that Line(B,C) refers to a different line, not the side? But according to the given predicates, Line(B,C) is part of the rectangle ABCD. So that's supposed to be a side. Hmm. So this seems contradictory. Maybe the error lies elsewhere.

Let me look at the other given lengths. There's Line(D,G) with length 7.5, and Line(A,G) is x + 7.5. Also, Line(B,E) is 5. Let me see if there's another way to relate these. Maybe considering coordinates? Assign coordinates to the points and use the given lengths to set up equations. Let me try that.

Assume coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to rectangle ABCD. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose AB is along the x-axis and AD is along the y-axis. So if DA is length x, then since DA is vertical, point D would be at (0, x). Then, point B would be at (a, 0), where a is the length of AB. Point C would be at (a, x), completing the rectangle. So AB = a, BC = x, CD = a, DA = x. Now, the length of BC is x, but according to the given, Line(B,C) has length Sub(x, 2). So BC is x - 2. Wait, but earlier, BC was supposed to be x. So this would imply x = x - 2 → 0 = -2. Again, impossible. Therefore, something is wrong here. Perhaps my coordinate assignment is incorrect?

Wait, maybe the rectangle is not aligned with axes? Or maybe the labels are different. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves more than just the sides. Let me check the other lines. There's Line(A,D) which is DA, which is vertical in my previous setup. Then, Line(D,G) is another line. G is a point in the second rectangle EFGH. How are the rectangles connected? The problem also includes Line(A,D), Line(B,E), Line(C,F), Line(D,G). These lines connect points from one rectangle to the other. So A to D connects to D to G? Wait, perhaps these lines are connecting corresponding points or something else. 

Let me think again. The problem mentions that the two rectangles are similar. So the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Let's denote the ratio as k. So if ABCD ~ EFGH, then the ratio of AB to EF is k, BC to FG is k, etc. But how do I find this ratio? Maybe using the given lengths involving x.

Also, there's Line(A,G) with length x + 7.5. Let me see. If I can express AG in terms of the coordinates. Suppose in my coordinate system, A is (0,0), D is (0,x). Then, what is point G? Well, the second rectangle is EFGH. Let's assume that the connection lines are from A to D, B to E, C to F, D to G. So maybe these lines are parts of the rectangles' sides or diagonals. For instance, Line(A,D) is a side of ABCD, Line(B,E) connects B to E, which might be a side or diagonal of EFGH. Similarly, Line(C,F) connects C to F, Line(D,G) connects D to G. 

Alternatively, perhaps these lines are vectors or translations between the rectangles? Not sure yet. Let me try to think of the entire configuration. If the two rectangles are similar, then their corresponding sides are proportional. Also, the lines connecting certain points might indicate some relationship between them.

Another given is Line(A,G) has length x + 7.5. Let me see if I can find expressions for AG. Assuming coordinates again, maybe. Let me proceed with coordinates for both rectangles.

Let me define rectangle ABCD with coordinates as before: A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,b), D(0,b). Wait, but earlier, I thought DA had length x, which would be b. But then BC is also length b. However, according to the given, Line(B,C) has length x - 2. So if BC is length b, then b = x - 2. But DA is length b, which is x. Therefore, x = x - 2 → contradiction again. So this suggests that my assumption about DA being a vertical side is incorrect. Maybe the rectangle is rotated or labeled differently?

Alternatively, perhaps DA is not a vertical side. Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then DA is a side, but its orientation depends on the rectangle's rotation. However, without knowing the exact shape, it's hard to tell. Maybe I need to consider that Line(A,D) is not necessarily perpendicular to Line(A,B)? No, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if AB and AD are adjacent sides, they are perpendicular. Therefore, DA is a side of length x, making AD perpendicular to AB. 

This brings me back to the earlier contradiction. So why is there a discrepancy here? Is there a possibility that Line(B,C) is not a side of the rectangle but another line? But according to the given, Line(B,C) is part of the rectangle. So that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the problem uses non-standard notation? Like, maybe the rectangle is not convex or the points are not in order? Or maybe the lines mentioned are not the sides but other connections? Let me check the list of lines again. The lines for rectangle ABCD are Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). So those are the four sides. Therefore, BC is a side of the rectangle. So BC length is equal to AD length, which is x. But the given says Line(B,C) is x - 2. So x - 2 = x → contradiction. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo, but assuming it's correctly formulated, I need to find another way. Let me look at the other given lengths. There's Line(D,G) = 7.5, and Line(A,G) = x + 7.5. Also, Line(B,E) = 5. Let me think about these. If I can relate these lengths using the similarity of the rectangles.

Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same. Let me denote the sides of ABCD as length AB and width AD. Let me call AB = a, AD = x. Then BC = AD = x, and AB = CD = a. For rectangle EFGH, let me denote its sides as EF and FG. Since they are similar, the ratio of AB/EF = BC/FG = AD/... etc. Let me say the ratio is k, so that AB = k * EF, BC = k * FG, etc.

But how does this relate to the other lengths given? Let me think about the lines connecting points between the rectangles. For example, Line(A,D) is a side of ABCD, length x. Line(D,G) is given as 7.5. What is G? It's a vertex of rectangle EFGH. If Line(D,G) is a line connecting D to G, which is a vertex of the other rectangle. If the rectangles are similar and positioned in a particular way, maybe these lines represent something like translating or scaling between the rectangles.

Alternatively, maybe AG is a diagonal connecting A to G, which could be a combination of sides from both rectangles. Let me try to model this. Suppose in rectangle EFGH, the points are E, F, G, H. Given that Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,E) are the sides. Also, there are lines connecting A to D, B to E, C to F, D to G. These lines may form some relation between the rectangles.

For example, if Line(B,E) is a line connecting B to E, which is a side of EFGH. Similarly, Line(C,F) connects C to F, which is a side of EFGH. Line(D,G) connects D to G, a side of EFGH. Line(A,D) connects A to D, a side of ABCD. 

Perhaps these lines are corresponding sides or diagonals? For instance, if the rectangles are placed such that each corner of ABCD is connected to a corresponding corner of EFGH. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging, but let's attempt to assign variables.

Assuming that the rectangles are placed such that A corresponds to E, B to F, C to G, D to H? Or some other correspondence? Wait, but the lines are A-D, B-E, C-F, D-G. So maybe each vertex of ABCD is connected to a vertex of EFGH. For example, A to D (but D is a vertex of ABCD?), no. Wait, the line A-D is from A to D, which is a side of ABCD. Line(D,G) connects D to G, which is a vertex of EFGH. So perhaps D is connected to G, implying that G is a point related to D.

Alternatively, maybe these lines are not sides but diagonals or something else. Let me think about the length AG. AG connects A to G. If I can find AG in terms of the sides of the rectangles and the similarity ratio.

Let me try to consider coordinates again. Let me assume that rectangle ABCD has coordinates as follows:

Let’s take A at (0, 0). Since DA is a side of length x, and assuming DA is vertical, then D would be at (0, x). Then, AB is horizontal, so B would be at (a, 0), and C would be at (a, x). Now, rectangle EFGH is similar to ABCD. Let's assume that the similarity transformation maps ABCD to EFGH. Let me consider the lines connecting the points: A to D, B to E, C to F, D to G. 

If I assume that these lines are transformations between the rectangles, perhaps translation, rotation, or scaling. But since they are similar, the transformation is a similarity transformation (rotation, scaling, translation).

But without knowing the exact position, it's difficult. However, the lengths given might help. For example, Line(B,E) is 5. If B is at (a, 0), then E is a point in rectangle EFGH. If the transformation maps B to E, then the vector from B to E would depend on the transformation. But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, let's think about the length AG. If A is at (0,0) and G is a point in rectangle EFGH. Let me assume that G is related to D in some way. For instance, if D is connected to G via Line(D,G), which is length 7.5. So distance from D(0,x) to G is 7.5. Also, AG is x + 7.5. So the distance from A(0,0) to G is x + 7.5.

So if I can express G's coordinates, I can relate these distances. Let me denote G as (p, q). Then, the distance from D(0,x) to G(p,q) is sqrt[(p-0)^2 + (q - x)^2] = 7.5. Also, distance from A(0,0) to G(p,q) is sqrt[p^2 + q^2] = x + 7.5. Squaring both equations:

From D to G: p² + (q - x)² = 7.5² = 56.25

From A to G: p² + q² = (x + 7.5)²

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

[ p² + q² ] - [ p² + (q - x)² ] = (x + 7.5)² - 56.25

Expanding the left side:

q² - (q² - 2qx + x²) = 2qx - x²

Right side:

x² + 15x + 56.25 - 56.25 = x² + 15x

Therefore:

2qx - x² = x² + 15x

Rearranging:

2qx - x² - x² - 15x = 0 → 2qx - 2x² - 15x = 0 → 2qx = 2x² + 15x → divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0):

2q = 2x + 15 → q = x + 7.5

Interesting, so q = x + 7.5. So the y-coordinate of G is x + 7.5. Now, substituting back into the equation from D to G:

p² + (q - x)^2 = 56.25 → p² + (x + 7.5 - x)^2 = 56.25 → p² + (7.5)^2 = 56.25 → p² + 56.25 = 56.25 → p² = 0 → p = 0.

So G is at (0, x + 7.5). Wait, that means G is vertically above D, since D is at (0, x), and G is at (0, x + 7.5). So the line DG is vertical, length 7.5, which matches the given. Also, AG is the distance from A(0,0) to G(0, x+7.5), which is simply x + 7.5, matching the given. So this checks out.

Now, what about the rest of the information? Let me recall that Line(B,E) is 5. Point B is at (a, 0). Let me assume that E is a point in rectangle EFGH. Since we know G is at (0, x + 7.5), and EFGH is a rectangle. Let me try to find coordinates for E, F, G, H.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and we know G is at (0, x + 7.5). Let me assume that the rectangle EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Since it's similar to ABCD, which has sides of length a and x. So the sides of EFGH would be proportional. Let me denote the scale factor as k. So if ABCD has sides a and x, then EFGH has sides ka and kx.

But how to relate this to the given points? Let me think about the connection between B and E. Line(B,E) has length 5. Point B is at (a, 0), and E is a vertex of EFGH. If I can find coordinates for E, then compute the distance from B to E.

Also, since EFGH is a rectangle, and we know G is at (0, x + 7.5). Let me try to find coordinates for E. Let's assume that the rectangle EFGH is oriented similarly to ABCD. Let's say that FG is a vertical side, and FE is a horizontal side. If G is at (0, x + 7.5), then F would be horizontally adjacent to G. Let me think: in rectangle EFGH, moving from F to G would be a side. Assuming the rectangle is oriented similarly to ABCD, then if FG is vertical, then F would be to the left of G. So if G is at (0, x + 7.5), then F would be at (-k*something, ...). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Since EFGH is similar to ABCD, and the scale factor is k. Let's say that the sides of EFGH are k*a and k*x. Let me assume that the rectangle EFGH has its sides aligned similarly to ABCD. For example, if EF is horizontal and FG is vertical. Then, if G is at (0, x + 7.5), and assuming that FG is vertical, then F would be directly below G. Let me say F is at (0 - h, y), but this needs more precise calculation.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of G, and if we can find others. Let me think about the line from D to G, which is vertical, and G is at (0, x + 7.5). Also, since EFGH is a rectangle, and Line(E,F), Line(F,G), etc., are its sides. If we can find coordinates for E, F, H, then we can find relations.

Given that Line(B,E) has length 5. Point B is at (a, 0). Let me assume that E is a point such that the distance from B to E is 5. But without knowing E's location, it's tricky. However, since EFGH is similar to ABCD, and assuming that the correspondence between rectangles is such that A maps to E, B maps to F, C maps to G, D maps to H? Wait, but earlier, D is connected to G. If that's the case, then D maps to G? Or is it another mapping?

Alternatively, since Line(B,E) exists, perhaps B maps to E under the similarity transformation. If the similarity transformation maps ABCD to EFGH, then the transformation takes A to E, B to F, C to G, D to H. But in our case, Line(D,G) exists, which would mean that D is mapped to G? Wait, if D is mapped to G, then that would imply that the transformation sends D to G. But then, since the transformation is a similarity, it would preserve ratios. Let me explore this possibility.

Assuming that the similarity transformation maps A→E, B→F, C→G, D→H. But in the given, Line(D,G) is present, which would mean that D is connected to G. If D maps to H, then G is another point. This might not align directly. However, let's try to proceed with this idea.

Under the similarity transformation, the distance from A to D in ABCD is x, and the distance from E to H in EFGH should be the same scaled by the similarity ratio. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is k. So AB / EF = BC / FG = AD / EH = ... etc.

But I need to relate the given lengths to this. Also, there's Line(B,E) = 5. If B is transformed to F, then the distance from B to E would be related to the transformation. This is getting too abstract. Let me try to find another way.

Earlier, we found that G is at (0, x + 7.5). Also, the length of Line(B,E) is 5. Let me assume that E is a point such that Line(B,E) is 5. Let me suppose that E is related to the rectangle EFGH. Since G is at (0, x + 7.5), and EFGH is a rectangle, let me try to find coordinates for E.

In rectangle EFGH, if G is at (0, x + 7.5), and assuming that FG is a side. Let me suppose that FG is horizontal. So if F is to the left of G, then F would be at (f_x, y), and G is at (f_x + length_of_FG, y). But without knowing the orientation, it's hard. Alternatively, since we know that Line(E,F), Line(F,G), etc., are sides of the rectangle.

Alternatively, since EFGH is similar to ABCD, which has sides of length a and x. So the sides of EFGH are k*a and k*x for some k. Let me denote the sides of EFGH as s and t, with s/t = a/x, due to similarity. Also, the distance from B to E is 5. Let me think about what B to E represents. If B is a point in ABCD and E is a point in EFGH, perhaps connected via the similarity transformation. 

Alternatively, since Line(B,E) is given, and we know B's coordinates as (a,0), and E is a point somewhere. If I can find coordinates for E, then I can write the distance formula. But without knowing E's location, this is still unclear.

Wait, earlier we determined that G is at (0, x + 7.5). Let me think about the other lines. Line(C,F) is given. Point C is at (a, x). So Line(C,F) connects C(a, x) to F. If F is a vertex of EFGH, then F is connected to G. Let me assume that FG is a side of EFGH, so F is connected to G. Since G is at (0, x + 7.5), and assuming FG is a side, then F would be either to the left or right of G. Let me say that FG is horizontal, so F is at (g_x, y), and G is at (g_x + length_of_FG, y). But I don't know the direction.

Alternatively, since EFGH is similar to ABCD, and if we assume that the sides of EFGH are proportional to ABCD's sides. Let me say that the sides of EFGH are k*a and k*x, with k being the similarity ratio. Let me assume that in EFGH, the horizontal side is k*a and vertical side is k*x, or vice versa, depending on orientation.

But how does this relate to the other given lengths? Let's think about the line BE, which has length 5. If B is at (a, 0), and E is a point in EFGH. Let me assume that E is a vertex of EFGH, and possibly related to the transformation. For example, if the similarity transformation maps A to E, then E would be the image of A under the transformation. But without knowing the transformation details, it's difficult.

Alternatively, since we have AG = x + 7.5, and we found G is at (0, x + 7.5), and A is at (0,0), then AG is vertical, length x + 7.5, which matches. Also, DG is from D(0,x) to G(0, x + 7.5), which is vertical, length 7.5, matching the given.

Now, what about Line(B,E) = 5? Point B is at (a, 0). Let me assume that E is at (some coordinates). If I can find E's coordinates based on the rectangle EFGH. Let me think about the other points.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and we know G is at (0, x + 7.5). Let me try to find F and E. Let's assume that the rectangle EFGH has sides FG and GH. Since G is at (0, x + 7.5), and assuming FG is a vertical side, then F would be directly below G, at (0, x + 7.5 - length of FG). But length of FG would be either k*a or k*x, depending on the orientation.

Alternatively, since EFGH is similar to ABCD, which has sides a and x. Let's say that the sides of EFGH are in the same ratio as ABCD. So if ABCD has sides a and x, then EFGH has sides ka and kx. Let me assume that the sides of EFGH are horizontal and vertical, like ABCD. So if FG is a vertical side, then its length is kx, and FE is a horizontal side, length ka.

If FG is vertical, then from point F to G is vertical. So if G is at (0, x + 7.5), then F would be at (0, x + 7.5 - kx). Let me call this y-coordinate as y_F = x + 7.5 - kx.

Then, since FE is a horizontal side, from F to E would be horizontal. So E would be at (something, y_F). Let me say that FE has length ka, so if F is at (0, y_F), then E would be at (ka, y_F) or (-ka, y_F). Depending on direction.

Assuming the rectangle is oriented similarly to ABCD, so FE is horizontal. If we take E to be to the right of F, then E would be at (ka, y_F). Then, the coordinates of E would be (ka, y_F).

Now, the distance from B(a, 0) to E(ka, y_F) is 5. So:

√[(ka - a)^2 + (y_F - 0)^2] = 5

Square both sides:

(ka - a)^2 + y_F^2 = 25

We already have y_F = x + 7.5 - kx. Let me substitute:

(ka - a)^2 + (x + 7.5 - kx)^2 = 25

Also, since EFGH is similar to ABCD, the sides are ka and kx. But what is the relationship between k and the other variables?

Additionally, since Line(C,F) is given. Point C is at (a, x), and Line(C,F) connects to F. F is at (0, y_F). So the distance from C(a, x) to F(0, y_F) is:

√[(a - 0)^2 + (x - y_F)^2] = √[a² + (x - y_F)^2]

But what is this distance? Is it a side or diagonal of EFGH? Since Line(C,F) is part of the rectangle EFGH? No, because EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So Line(C,F) is not a side of EFGH. Wait, the given predicates include Line(C,F) as part of the lines, but it's not specified whether it's a side or not. However, the original rectangle EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So Line(C,F) is a line from C to F, which is a point in EFGH. 

But how does this help? Maybe this distance relates to something. Let me think. Since C is a point in ABCD, and F is a point in EFGH, perhaps there's a relationship between them. But without more info, it's hard to say.

However, we also have the similarity between the rectangles. So the ratio of corresponding sides is k. For example, AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG, etc. Let me try to express that.

AB is length a, EF is length ka. BC is length x, FG is length kx. So the ratio k = AB / EF = BC / FG = a/(ka) = x/(kx) = 1/k. Wait, this implies that a/(ka) = x/(kx) → 1/k = 1/k, which holds true. So this doesn't give new information. But it shows that the ratio k is consistent.

But how to find k? Let me think about other given lengths. We also have Line(B,C) = x - 2. Earlier, we saw that BC is a side of ABCD, which is x. But according to the given, Line(B,C) is x - 2. This contradiction suggests that my earlier assumption about BC being x is wrong. Wait, but earlier analysis said that BC is a side of ABCD, which should be equal to AD, which is x. But the given says it's x - 2. This inconsistency implies that there's a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps Line(B,C) is not a side of the rectangle? But the given predicates say Line(B,C) is part of the rectangle ABCD, so it should be a side. This suggests that there's a fundamental error in my understanding. Let me revisit the beginning.

Maybe the problem uses a different convention for naming the rectangles? For example, maybe ABCD is not a standard rectangle but a parallelogram? But the problem says it's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the Line(B,C) is not a side but a diagonal? Let me check. In a rectangle, the diagonals are AC and BD. So if Line(B,C) were a diagonal, it would be from B to C, which is a side, not a diagonal. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the given Line(B,C) is a typo and should be Line(B,C) as a diagonal? Or maybe the problem has a different configuration. Alternatively, maybe the given Line(B,C) is referring to a different line, not the side. But the predicates explicitly state Line(B,C) as part of the rectangle ABCD, so it must be a side.

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction in BC's length. Let me try to resolve it by considering that maybe Line(B,C) is not a side but another line. Wait, the problem says "Rectangle(A,B,C,D)" which usually means the points are in order, so AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. So BC is definitely a side. Hence, its length should be equal to AD, which is x. But the given says it's x - 2. This suggests that x - 2 = x → -2 = 0, which is impossible. 

This indicates that there must be a different interpretation. Perhaps the Line(B,C) is not the side of the rectangle but another line, like a diagonal or something else? Let me think: if Line(B,C) is a diagonal of the rectangle, then its length would be sqrt(a² + x²). But the given says it's x - 2. So:

sqrt(a² + x²) = x - 2 → square both sides: a² + x² = x² - 4x + 4 → a² = -4x + 4. Since lengths are positive, this implies -4x + 4 > 0 → x < 1. But x is a length, so positive. Also, from the other given, Line(A,G) = x + 7.5, and Line(D,G) = 7.5. From earlier, we found that G is at (0, x + 7.5), and D is at (0, x). So DG is 7.5, which fits. But if Line(B,C) is a diagonal, then a² = -4x + 4. Also, from Line(B,E) = 5, which we had earlier:

(ka - a)^2 + (x + 7.5 - kx)^2 = 25. But this introduces more variables. However, this path might work if I can relate a and x.

But how? Let me try. If Line(B,C) is a diagonal, then its length is sqrt(a² + x²) = x - 2. So:

sqrt(a² + x²) = x - 2 → square both sides: a² + x² = x² -4x +4 → a² = -4x +4.

Also, from Line(A,G) = x + 7.5, and Line(D,G) = 7.5. As before, this gave us G at (0, x + 7.5).

Now, what about Line(B,E) = 5? Let me recall that E is at (ka, y_F) = (ka, x + 7.5 - kx). So the distance from B(a, 0) to E(ka, x + 7.5 - kx) is 5. So:

sqrt[(ka - a)^2 + (x + 7.5 - kx - 0)^2] = 5.

Square both sides:

(ka - a)^2 + (x + 7.5 - kx)^2 = 25.

Expand:

a²(k - 1)^2 + (x(1 - k) + 7.5)^2 = 25.

Let me factor out (1 - k):

Let me note that (ka - a) = a(k - 1), and (x + 7.5 - kx) = x(1 - k) + 7.5.

So the expression becomes:

a²(k - 1)^2 + [x(1 - k) + 7.5]^2 = 25.

Let me expand the second term:

[x(1 - k) + 7.5]^2 = x²(1 - k)^2 + 15x(1 - k) + 56.25.

So overall:

a²(k - 1)^2 + x²(1 - k)^2 + 15x(1 - k) + 56.25 = 25.

Combine the first two terms:

(k - 1)^2(a² + x²) + 15x(1 - k) + 56.25 = 25.

Now, from earlier, we have a² = -4x + 4. Substitute that:

(k - 1)^2(-4x + 4 + x²) + 15x(1 - k) + 56.25 = 25.

Let me simplify inside the first term:

-4x + 4 + x² = x² -4x +4 = (x - 2)^2.

So now:

(k - 1)^2(x - 2)^2 + 15x(1 - k) + 56.25 = 25.

Let me factor out (1 - k) from the second term. Note that (k - 1) = -(1 - k), so:

= (k - 1)^2(x - 2)^2 - 15x(1 - k) + 56.25 = 25.

Let me let k - 1 = m. Then 1 - k = -m. So:

m²(x - 2)^2 - 15x(-m) + 56.25 = 25 → m²(x - 2)^2 + 15x m + 56.25 = 25.

Subtract 25 from both sides:

m²(x - 2)^2 + 15x m + 31.25 = 0.

This is a quadratic in m. To solve, we need to find m. But this seems complex. Let me see if there's another relationship to find k.

Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is k. For example, AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG. AB is length a, BC is length x. So if AB corresponds to EF, and BC corresponds to FG, then:

AB / EF = BC / FG = k.

But EF is a side of EFGH, which is either ka or kx, depending on orientation. Wait, earlier I assumed that EFGH has sides ka and kx, but which is which?

If ABCD has sides a (horizontal) and x (vertical), then EFGH, being similar, would have sides ka (horizontal) and kx (vertical), or vice versa. Let's assume that the horizontal side of EFGH is kx and the vertical side is ka. This would mean that the sides are swapped, but similarity allows for any rotation.

However, without knowing the exact orientation, it's hard to say. Let me assume that the horizontal side of EFGH is kx and the vertical side is ka. Then, for example, FG would be a vertical side of length ka, and FE would be horizontal of length kx.

But earlier, we had that FG is a side of length kx or ka? Depends on the orientation. Let me clarify: if ABCD has sides AB = a (horizontal) and BC = x (vertical), then EFGH, being similar, would have sides in the same ratio. So if AB corresponds to EF, then EF would be length ka, and FG, which is the next side, would be length kx. So the sides of EFGH are ka and kx.

Thus, the length of FG is kx. But FG is a side of EFGH. Earlier, we had that FG is from F to G, which we assumed was vertical, so its length is |y_G - y_F|. Since G is at (0, x + 7.5), and F is at (0, y_F), then FG length is x + 7.5 - y_F = kx. So:

x + 7.5 - y_F = kx → y_F = x + 7.5 - kx.

Which matches what we had before.

Now, returning to the equation:

m²(x - 2)^2 + 15x m + 31.25 = 0, where m = k - 1.

This seems too complex without knowing k. Maybe there's another relationship. Recall that Line(C,F) is given. Point C is at (a, x), and F is at (0, y_F). The distance from C to F is sqrt[a² + (x - y_F)^2]. What is this distance? It might be a side or diagonal of EFGH. If it's a side, then it would be either ka or kx. Let me assume it's a side. 

If Line(C,F) is a side of EFGH, then it would be either EF, FG, GH, or HE. But since F is a vertex, and C is a point in ABCD, it's not clear. Alternatively, this distance could be related to the similarity ratio. 

Alternatively, since we have a² = -4x + 4 from earlier (if Line(B,C) is a diagonal), let's substitute that into the equation. 

We have a² = x² -4x +4. Wait, no: earlier, from the diagonal assumption, we had a² = -4x +4. Let me confirm:

If Line(B,C) is a diagonal of ABCD, then its length is sqrt(a² + x²) = x - 2 → squared: a² + x² = x² -4x +4 → a² = -4x +4. Yes.

So now, in the equation for the distance from B to E, we have:

m²(x - 2)^2 + 15x m + 31.25 = 0, with m = k - 1.

But we also need to relate k to other quantities. Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of sides should be consistent. For example, AB / EF = BC / FG. AB is a, EF is ka. BC is x, FG is kx. So:

a / (ka) = x / (kx) → 1/k = 1/k, which is always true. So no new info.

But what about the other sides? For example, AD is x, and EH is kx or ka? Depends on orientation. Let me assume that EH is the same as AD, which is x, so EH = x. Since EH is a side of EFGH, it would be either ka or kx. So if EH = x, then it's either ka = x or kx = x. Let me assume that EH corresponds to AD, which is x. So if EH is a side of EFGH, then EH = x. If EH is a horizontal side, then it would be ka = x, giving k = x/a. Or if EH is vertical, then kx = x → k = 1. But k = 1 would mean the
