MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. 

So, we have several points: A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z. All these points lie on Circle B. That means each of them is on the circumference of the same circle. Then there are some secants mentioned: Line AW, CX, and YZ are secants of Circle B. Also, there are some arc measures given. Specifically, Arc(YX) is twice Angle(YBX), Arc(WX) is twice Angle(WBX), and Arc(YZ) equals 360 minus Arc(WX) minus Arc(ZY). Wait, but Arc(ZY) would be the same as Arc(YZ)? Or maybe it's different? Hmm, arcs are typically measured in degrees, so maybe there's some relationship here.

The question asks for the measure of arc YXZ. Wait, arc YXZ—probably that refers to the arc from Y to Z passing through X? Or maybe it's a typo and should be arc YX? But the options are numerical, so let me check again.

Wait, the question says "m ∠YXZ"—wait no, wait the original question was about the measure of m widehat Y X Z. Oh, right, that's the arc measure. So the arc from Y to Z passing through X? Or maybe it's the major arc YZ? Because sometimes notation like YXZ could imply the arc going through X. But since all points are on the circle, perhaps the arc YXZ is the arc starting at Y, going through X, ending at Z. So that's the major arc YZ if X is somewhere along the way. Alternatively, maybe it's the arc from Y to Z with X being a point on the arc. But I need to clarify.

But first, let's note down all the given equations. Let me write them out:

1. MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)). So Arc YX is twice the angle at B subtended by YX. Since B is the center of the circle (since all points lie on Circle B), angle YBX is a central angle. Wait, because B is the center. Therefore, the measure of angle YBX is equal to the measure of arc YX. Wait, but according to the predicate, MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) equals 2 times MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)). Wait, that seems contradictory unless there's something wrong here. Wait, hold on—if B is the center, then angle YBX is a central angle, so its measure should be equal to the measure of arc YX. But the predicate says that MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)), implying that angle YBX is half the arc YX. Which would only happen if angle YBX were an inscribed angle. But since B is the center, angle YBX is a central angle. So this suggests that either there's a misunderstanding, or perhaps I misread the predicate.

Wait, let me check again. The predicate says MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)). So if B is the center, then angle YBX is a central angle, so its measure should equal the arc measure. Hence, this equation would imply that arc YX is twice angle YBX, which would only be true if angle YBX were an inscribed angle. But since B is the center, that's impossible. Unless... wait, maybe the angle isn't at the center. Wait, the points are A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z on Circle B. So B is the center. So angle YBX is formed by points Y, B, X. So yes, that's a central angle. Therefore, arc YX should be equal to angle YBX. But the given equation says arc YX equals twice angle YBX. This seems conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle isn't at B? Wait, the angle is written as Angle(Y,B,X)—so vertex at B. So that's definitely a central angle. So why does the measure of the arc equal twice the measure of the angle? That doesn't align with standard circle theorems. Wait, unless the angle is not at the center. Wait, but the notation Angle(Y,B,X) implies vertex at B. So this suggests that there's a contradiction unless there's some other interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not at the center. Wait, but the problem states that Point B is the center of the circle. So angle YBX is indeed a central angle. Therefore, its measure should equal the arc measure. Therefore, the equation given here seems incorrect unless there's another explanation. Wait, perhaps the angle is not the central angle? For example, maybe the angle is formed by two chords intersecting at B, but if B is the center, then those chords are radii, making the angle a central angle. So this is confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the other given equations. Similarly, MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(W,B,X)). Again, same situation. So if Angle(W,B,X) is a central angle, then arc WX equals angle WBX. But according to the predicate, arc WX equals twice angle WBX. Same inconsistency. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the angle is not at the center? But how? Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

Looking back, the points are defined as follows: Points A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z. Circle B. So B is the center. So if we have points Y, B, X, then angle YBX is a central angle. However, the given equation says that arc YX equals twice that angle. Which would require that angle YBX is half the arc measure, which would only be true if angle YBX were an inscribed angle. But since B is the center, that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not at the center? Perhaps the angle is at a different point? But the notation is Angle(Y,B,X), which is angle at B. So this is perplexing. Is there a possibility that the angle is at point Y or X instead? Like, maybe a typo in the notation? For example, maybe it's supposed to be Angle(Y,X,B) or something else? But assuming the problem is stated correctly, I have to work with what's given. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not referring to the central angle. Wait, but how? Let me think. Suppose that B is not the center. Wait, but the problem says Circle(B), so B is the center. So that's fixed. 

Hmm. There's a contradiction here. Unless there's a different interpretation. Wait, perhaps the angle is not formed by connecting Y to B to X, but rather, the angle is formed by some other configuration. But according to the syntax, Angle(Y,B,X) means the angle at B between points Y and X. So that's a central angle. 

Wait, unless the angle is not formed by the radius. Wait, but Y and X are on the circle, so BY and BX are radii. Therefore, angle YBX is a central angle. Therefore, its measure equals arc YX. So the given equation says arc YX equals twice angle YBX. Which would imply that angle YBX is half the arc measure. Which contradicts the standard theorem. 

Therefore, there must be some error in my assumptions. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different definition? For instance, sometimes in problems, people refer to the measure of an arc as the degree measure, while the measure of an angle could be in radians. But even then, converting between radians and degrees would require π factors. But the problem mentions MeasureOf(Arc(...)), which is likely in degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at the center. Wait, but how? Let me consider the possibility that B is not the center. Wait, but the problem says Circle(B), which usually denotes that B is the center. Unless there's a different convention. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is an inscribed angle. For example, if the angle is at point Y or X. Wait, but the notation is Angle(Y,B,X), which is angle at B. So unless there's a misinterpretation of the notation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the angle is at another point. For example, if the angle was at point X, then it would be an inscribed angle. Let's suppose that. Let me try that. 

Assume that the angle is at point X, i.e., Angle(Y,X,B). Then, that would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc YB. Wait, but that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the angle is at point A? No, the points are A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

Wait, maybe I need to proceed despite the confusion. Let me try to see if there's another way. Let me assume that the given equations are correct, even though they seem contradictory. 

Given that MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)), and similarly for the other arc. Let me denote:

Let’s call α = MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)), so MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2α. 

Similarly, for Arc(W,X): β = MeasureOf(Angle(W,B,X)), so MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) = 2β. 

Then, the third equation: MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) = 360° - MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) - MeasureOf(Arc(Z,Y)). 

Wait, Arc(Z,Y) is the same as Arc(Y,Z) if it's the minor arc. But depending on direction, but generally, arcs are considered as the smaller one unless specified otherwise. However, since the total circle is 360°, if we take the sum of Arc(W,X), Arc(Z,Y), and Arc(Y,Z), it might not add up unless there's some relation. 

Wait, the equation says MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) = 360° - MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) - MeasureOf(Arc(Z,Y)). Let me rearrange that:

MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) + MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) + MeasureOf(Arc(Z,Y)) = 360°. 

But that would mean that the sum of three arcs equals 360°, which would only make sense if they are adjacent arcs covering the entire circle. So maybe Arc(W,X), Arc(X,Y), Arc(Y,Z), etc. Wait, but the equation includes Arc(Y,Z) and Arc(Z,Y), which might be the same arc but traversed in opposite directions. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and it should be Arc(Z,Y) instead of Arc(Z,Y). Let me think. Assuming that Arc(Z,Y) is the same as Arc(Y,Z), then the equation becomes MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) = 360° - MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) - MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)). Rearranging gives:

MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) + MeasureOf(Arc(W,X)) + MeasureOf(Arc(Y,Z)) = 360° → 2*Arc(Y,Z) + Arc(W,X) = 360°. 

But without knowing more, this may not help directly. 

However, let's try to find relations between the arcs. Let me note that all points are on the circle, so the total circumference is 360°. 

Also, considering that Lines AW, CX, and YZ are secants. So Line AW passes through points A and W, both on the circle. Similarly for others. 

Now, the question is to find the measure of arc YXZ. Assuming that arc YXZ is the arc from Y to Z passing through X. So that would be the major arc YZ if X is located such that the arc goes through X. Alternatively, it might be the minor arc, but the notation is unclear. 

But given the presence of points Y, X, Z on the circle, arc YXZ would be the arc from Y to Z that passes through X. So the measure would be the sum of arc YX and arc XZ. 

But we need to find the measure of that arc. 

Let me think about the given equations again. 

We know that MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)). Let me denote that as Arc(YX) = 2θ₁, where θ₁ is Angle(YBX). Similarly, Arc(WX) = 2θ₂, where θ₂ is Angle(WBX). 

Additionally, the third equation: Arc(YZ) = 360° - Arc(WX) - Arc(ZY). 

But Arc(ZY) is the same as Arc(YZ), so this equation might be trying to express that Arc(YZ) plus Arc(WX) plus Arc(ZY) equals 360°, but that would require Arc(YZ) to be equal to something. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the equation. Let me assume that the intended equation is Arc(YZ) = 360° - Arc(WX) - Arc(ZY), but since Arc(ZY) is the same as Arc(YZ), then Arc(YZ) = 360° - Arc(WX) - Arc(YZ), leading to 2*Arc(YZ) = 360° - Arc(WX), so Arc(YZ) = (360° - Arc(WX))/2. 

But I need to verify this. 

Alternatively, maybe the equation is supposed to relate Arc(YZ) with Arc(WX) and Arc(ZY), where Arc(ZY) is another arc. For example, if Arc(ZY) is the minor arc, and Arc(YZ) is the major arc. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misprint and it should be Arc(Y,Z) = 360° - Arc(W,X) - Arc(X,Y). In that case, Arc(YZ) = 360° - Arc(WX) - Arc(XY). 

But regardless, let's try to find relations between the arcs. 

First, let me consider the arcs around the circle. Since all points are on Circle B, the total circumference is 360°. So the sum of all arcs between consecutive points should be 360°. 

But I don't know the order of the points on the circle. However, we can use the given equations to relate the arcs. 

Let me start with the first two equations. 

From the first equation: Arc(YX) = 2 * Angle(YBX). But since B is the center, Angle(YBX) is a central angle, so it should equal Arc(YX). Therefore, Arc(YX) = 2 * Arc(YX), implying that Arc(YX) = 0, which is impossible. This suggests a contradiction. 

Wait, this is a critical issue. How can Arc(YX) equal twice itself? It must mean that there's a misunderstanding. 

Perhaps the angle is not a central angle. Let me reconsider. What if B is not the center? Wait, but the problem says Circle(B), so B is the center. So this seems like a contradiction. 

Unless the angle is not at the center. Wait, but how? 

Wait, maybe the angle is formed by two chords, not necessarily radii. For example, if we have points Y and X on the circle, and B is another point, not necessarily the center. Wait, but the problem defines Circle(B), so B must be the center. 

This is very confusing. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the notation. Let me check the initial predicates again. 

The problem says: 
"PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(B))"
and similarly for other points. So Circle B has points A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z. So B is the center. 

Then, the Secant(Line(A,W), Circle(B)) — so line AW is a secant of the circle, meaning it intersects the circle at two points, which are A and W. 

Same for Line(C,X) and Line(Y,Z). 

Now, the angle measures. 

MeasureOf(Arc(Y,X)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)). 

Wait, if Angle(Y,B,X) is an inscribed angle. But for that, the vertex would be on the circumference. But here, the vertex is at B, the center. So this suggests that the angle is a central angle, which should equal the arc measure. 

But the equation says the arc is twice the angle. This implies that the angle is half the arc. Which would be true if the angle were an inscribed angle. 

Ah! Wait, here's the key. Maybe the angle is an inscribed angle, not a central one. But how? If the vertex is at B, which is the center, then it's a central angle. But if the angle were at another point, say, at point Y or X, then it would be an inscribed angle. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not at B, but the notation is misinterpreted. For example, if the angle is Angle(Y,X,B), which would mean the angle at X between Y and B. But that would be an inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point Y or X. 

Wait, the problem uses the notation Angle(Y,B,X), which traditionally means the angle at point B between points Y and X. So that's a central angle. 

But if the given equation is that arc YX equals twice the central angle, which is impossible. So this suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem setup. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not at B, but at another point. For example, if the angle is at point A. But the notation is Angle(Y,B,X), so it's at B. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the angle should be at a different point. For example, if the angle is at point Y or X, then it would be an inscribed angle. 

Let me assume that there's a typo and the angle is at point Y. So Angle(Y,X,B) would be the angle at Y between points X and B. That would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc XB. 

But this is just speculation. Given that the problem is presented as solvable, I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a correct interpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(Y,B,X)) refers to an inscribed angle. Let me think differently. Suppose that Angle(Y,B,X) is actually an inscribed angle. For that, the vertex would be on the circumference. But B is the center, so that's not possible. 

Wait, unless the angle is formed by points Y, B, X, but B is not the center. But the problem states Circle(B), so B must be the center. 

At this point, I think the problem might have an error, but since it's presented as a valid question, I need to find a way forward. Let me try to assume that the given equations are correct and derive relations. 

Let me define variables:

Let’s denote:

Let’s call arc YX = 2a, and angle YBX = a. 

Similarly, arc WX = 2b, angle WBX = b. 

Then, the third equation: arc YZ = 360° - arc WX - arc ZY. 

But arc ZY is the same as arc YZ if it's the minor arc. Assuming that, then arc YZ = 360° - 2b - arc YZ → 2*arc YZ = 360° - 2b → arc YZ = (360° - 2b)/2 = 180° - b. 

Now, the total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs should be 360°. 

But I need to relate the arcs. 

Let me consider the arcs around the circle. Let me imagine the circle with points Y, X, Z, W, etc. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in some order. For example, let's assume that the points are placed such that moving around the circle from Y, we pass through X, then Z, then W, etc. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, let's consider that arc YX is 2a, arc WX is 2b, and arc YZ is 180° - b. 

But how do these arcs relate to each other? 

If I can find relations between these arcs, maybe I can find the measure of arc YXZ, which is arc YX plus arc XZ. 

But to find arc XZ, I need more information. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another equation involving these arcs. 

Let me think about the other secants. 

Line AW is a secant, so it passes through A and W. Since A and W are on the circle. 

Similarly, Line CX passes through C and X, and Line YZ passes through Y and Z. 

But I don't see how this helps yet. 

Wait, perhaps the arcs are connected via the secants. For example, the secant AW might relate to arcs WA and AW. 

But this is too vague. 

Let me go back to the arc equations. 

We have arc YX = 2a, arc WX = 2b, arc YZ = 180° - b. 

If I can find another relation between these arcs. 

For example, if we consider the entire circle: 

Suppose that the points are arranged such that arc YX + arc XW + arc WZ + ... equals 360°. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc YX and arc WX. 

Let me think about the angles. 

Angle YBX is a central angle, so it should equal arc YX. But the given equation says arc YX = 2 * angle YBX. So this implies that angle YBX = arc YX / 2. 

But if B is the center, then angle YBX is equal to arc YX. Hence, this would require that arc YX / 2 = arc YX → arc YX = 0, which is impossible. 

Thus, there's a contradiction. This suggests that either the problem is flawed, or there's a misinterpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not a central angle, but an inscribed angle. Let me try this alternative approach. Assume that angle YBX is an inscribed angle. 

For that, the vertex B must be on the circumference. But B is the center, so it's not on the circumference. Hence, this is also impossible. 

Wait, unless B is not the center. Wait, but the problem says Circle(B), which typically denotes that B is the center. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another way. Let me focus on the arc YZ equation. 

The third equation: arc YZ = 360° - arc WX - arc ZY. 

Assuming that arc ZY is the same as arc YZ, this leads to arc YZ = 360° - arc WX - arc YZ → 2*arc YZ = 360° - arc WX → arc YZ = (360° - arc WX)/2. 

If I assume that arc WX is 2b (from earlier), then arc YZ = (360° - 2b)/2 = 180° - b. 

Now, if I can find b, I can find arc YZ. 

But how to find b? 

Well, arc WX = 2b, and angle WBX = b. If angle WBX is an inscribed angle, then it would be half the arc WX. But since B is the center, angle WBX is a central angle, so it should equal arc WX. Thus, b = arc WX. But arc WX = 2b ⇒ b = 2b ⇒ b=0, which is impossible. 

This again leads to a contradiction. 

Maybe the angle is at a different point. Let me assume that angle WBX is an inscribed angle. For that, the vertex B must be on the circumference. But B is the center, so it's not on the circumference. Hence, this is invalid. 

I'm at an impasse. Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angle is at a different point. For example, if the angle is at point X, then it would be an inscribed angle. 

Let me try that. Suppose the angle is at point X, so Angle(W,X,B). Then, this would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc WB. 

But then, the measure of angle WXB would be half the measure of arc WB. 

But I don't know if this helps. 

Alternatively, if the angle is at point W, Angle(W,B,X) is still at B. 

This is very confusing. Given that I'm stuck here, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the given equations are correct, despite the contradictions, and try to find numerical answers. 

Let me assume that arc YX = 2 * angle YBX, and arc WX = 2 * angle WBX. Let's denote angle YBX as α and angle WBX as β. Then, arc YX = 2α, arc WX = 2β. 

Now, let's consider the third equation: arc YZ = 360° - arc WX - arc ZY. 

Assuming arc ZY is the same as arc YZ, this gives arc YZ = 360° - 2β - arc YZ → 2*arc YZ = 360° - 2β → arc YZ = 180° - β. 

Now, if I can relate these arcs to other parts of the circle. 

Let me think about the full circle. If I can express other arcs in terms of α and β, maybe I can find relations. 

For example, suppose that the points are arranged in the order Y, X, Z, W, etc. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard. 

Alternatively, let's consider that arc YX + arc XW + arc WZ + ... = 360°. 

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if I consider that arc YX = 2α and arc WX = 2β, and arc YZ = 180° - β. 

If I can find another relation involving α and β. 

Perhaps by looking at other arcs or angles. 

Alternatively, consider that line AW is a secant. Since A and W are on the circle, line AW passes through the circle. But I don't see how this helps. 

Another thought: since all points are on the circle, the total measure of arcs between all points should sum to 360°. 

Assume that the points are arranged in the order Y, X, W, Z, and others. But again, without knowing the exact order, it's hard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc YXZ is the arc from Y to Z passing through X, which would be arc YX + arc XZ. 

If I can find arc XZ, then adding it to arc YX gives the desired measure. 

To find arc XZ, I need to relate it to other arcs. 

Let me try to find expressions for arc XZ. 

If I can find arc XZ in terms of α and β. 

Alternatively, consider that arc WX = 2β, and arc YX = 2α. 

If I assume that arc XZ is some value, say γ, then arc YZ would be arc YX + arc XZ = 2α + γ. 

But earlier, we had arc YZ = 180° - β. So 2α + γ = 180° - β → γ = 180° - β - 2α. 

But without more information, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if there's another equation relating α and β. 

Let me think about the angles at B. 

If I consider the angles at B, like angle YBX = α and angle WBX = β. If points Y, X, W are arranged around the circle, then the sum of angles around B should be 360°. 

Wait, B is the center, so the angles around B should add up to 360°. 

For example, if we consider the angles at B formed by connecting all points, the sum of all central angles should be 360°. 

But since there are multiple points, this could be complex. 

Assume that the points are arranged such that the central angles between them add up to 360°. 

For example, if we have points Y, X, W, Z, etc., then the central angles between them would contribute to the total 360°. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to proceed. 

However, let me try to consider that the central angles corresponding to arc YX (which is 2α), arc WX (which is 2β), and possibly others. 

But this is too vague. 

At this point, I think the problem might have a typo, but since I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that the given equations are correct and try to find numerical values. 

Let me assume that the arc measures are as per the given equations, even though they contradict the standard theorems. 

So, arc YX = 2α, arc WX = 2β, and arc YZ = 180° - β. 

Now, if I assume that the total of all arcs is 360°, but I need to find relations between α and β. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the angles at B are part of a larger structure. For example, if points Y, X, W are arranged such that the central angles around B add up to 360°. 

Let me assume that the central angles at B are angle YBX = α, angle WBX = β, and possibly others. 

But without knowing the exact number of points, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if there are only three arcs: YX, WX, and YZ, but that's not enough. 

This is getting too speculative. Given the time I've spent without progress, I'll try to look for another approach. 

Let me recall that the measure of an arc is twice the measure of an inscribed angle. So if I can find an inscribed angle that relates to the arc YXZ. 

But the problem involves arcs and angles at the center. 

Wait, the measure of arc YXZ is asked. If it's the arc from Y to Z passing through X, then it's the sum of arc YX and arc XZ. 

Let me denote arc YX as 2α, arc XZ as γ. So total arc YXZ is 2α + γ. 

If I can find γ. 

But how? 

Let me think about the other arc equations. 

We have arc YZ = 180° - β. 

Assuming that arc YZ is the same as arc YX + arc XZ, if X is between Y and Z. So arc YZ = arc YX + arc XZ = 2α + γ. 

But from earlier, arc YZ = 180° - β. 

So 2α + γ = 180° - β → γ = 180° - β - 2α. 

Now, if I can find another equation relating α and β. 

Consider the arc WX = 2β. If I can find a relation between α and β. 

Let me think about the points and lines. 

Line AW is a secant, passing through A and W. Since A and W are on the circle, this line passes through the circle at A and W. 

But I don't see how this helps. 

Alternatively, consider that there are other secants, like CX and YZ. 

But again, not sure. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that all points are on the circle, so the sum of certain arcs must be 360°. 

For example, if we consider the arcs between Y, X, Z, W, etc. 

But without knowing the exact order, it's hard. 

Alternatively, assume that arc YX + arc XW + arc WZ + arc ZY = 360°. 

But arc XW is 2β, arc ZY is 180° - β (from earlier), and arc YX is 2α. 

So 2α + 2β + (180° - β) + arc WZ = 360°. 

But this introduces new variables, arc WZ, which I don't know. 

This approach isn't working. 

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the given answer choices. 

Let me assume that the measure of arc YXZ is one of the options: 145, 166, 194, 215. 

Let me consider that arc YZ is 180° - β, and arc YX is 2α. If I can find a relationship between α and β. 

Alternatively, let's suppose that arc WX = 2β, and arc YX = 2α. If these arcs are adjacent, then the total from Y to W would be arc YX + arc XW = 2α + 2β. 

But without knowing the position of W relative to Y and X, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if arc YX and arc WX are parts of the same circle, maybe they overlap or form a larger arc. 

Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to assume that arc YX is 120°, and arc WX is 120°, then arc YZ would be 180° - 120° = 60°. Then, arc YXZ would be arc YX + arc XZ. If arc XZ is part of arc YZ, which is 60°, then it depends on the position. 

But this is too arbitrary. 

Alternatively, let's assume that the measure of arc YXZ is the major arc YZ, which would be 360° - arc YZ. If arc YZ is 180° - β, then major arc YZ is 360° - (180° - β) = 180° + β. 

But without knowing β, this is not helpful. 

Given that I cannot resolve the contradictions in the given equations, I'll have to make assumptions to proceed. 

Let me assume that the given equations are correct despite the contradictions, and proceed numerically. 

Let me set up equations:

From the first two equations:

arc YX = 2 * angle YBX  
arc WX = 2 * angle WBX  

Let me denote angle YBX as x, so arc YX = 2x.  
Similarly, angle WBX as y, so arc WX = 2y.  

From the third equation: arc YZ = 360° - arc WX - arc ZY.  
Assuming arc ZY is the same as arc YZ, then:  
arc YZ = 360° - 2y - arc YZ → 2*arc YZ = 360° - 2y → arc YZ = 180° - y.  

Now, if I can relate x and y. 

Assume that points Y, X, W are positioned such that the central angles at B add up to 360°. For example, if the central angles between Y-X-W-Y add up to 360°. 

But without knowing the exact positions, I'll assume that the central angles around B are x (for YX), y (for WX), and other angles. 

Let me assume that the total central angles around B are x + y + ... = 360°. 

But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, if arc YX = 2x and arc WX = 2y, and if these arcs are adjacent, then the total arc from Y to W would be 2x + 2y. 

But again, this is speculative. 

Let me assume that the arc YX and arc WX are parts of the circle, and that the remaining arc is arc YZ = 180° - y. 

If I assume that the total circumference is 360°, then:

arc YX + arc WX + arc YZ = 2x + 2y + (180° - y) = 2x + y + 180° = 360° → 2x + y = 180°. 

So 2x + y = 180°. 

Now, if I can find another equation relating x and y. 

Let me think about the other arcs. 

If there are other points, like A, C, V, etc., but I don't have information about them. 

Alternatively, if the arc YZ is 180° - y, and if there are other arcs, but I don't have data. 

However, the question asks for the measure of arc YXZ, which is arc YX + arc XZ. 

Let me assume that arc XZ is part of arc YZ. 

If arc YZ = 180° - y, and arc YX = 2x, then if X is between Y and Z, then arc XZ = arc YZ - arc YX = (180° - y) - 2x. 

But from earlier, 2x + y = 180° → y = 180° - 2x. 

Substituting into arc XZ: 

(180° - y) - 2x = (180° - (180° - 2x)) - 2x = 2x - 2x = 0. 

Which is impossible. 

This suggests another contradiction. 

At this point, I realize that without additional information or corrections to the problem, it's impossible to solve accurately. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, I'll attempt to infer based on common arc measures. 

Let me consider that the measure of arc YXZ is 166°, which is option B. 

Alternatively, if I assume that the measure of arc YZ is 180° - y, and if arc WX is 2y, and arc YX is 2x, and 2x + y = 180°, then if I set x = 30°, y = 120°, then arc YX = 60°, arc WX = 240°, arc YZ = 180° - 120° = 60°. Then, arc YXZ would be arc YX + arc XZ. If arc XZ is part of arc YZ, then arc XZ = 60° - arc YX = 60° - 60° = 0°, which is invalid. 

Alternatively, if x = 45°, y = 90°, then arc YX = 90°, arc WX = 180°, arc YZ = 180° - 90° = 90°. Then, arc YXZ would be arc YX + arc XZ. If arc XZ is part of arc YZ, then arc XZ = 90° - arc YX = 90° - 90° = 0°. Still invalid. 

This suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. 

Given that I'm unable to resolve the contradictions in the given equations, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common arc measures. 

Assuming that the measure of arc YXZ is 166°, which is option B, or 194°, option C. 

Since the options are 145, 166, 194, 215, and considering typical circle problems, 166° might be plausible. 

But this is purely a guess.
