MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus ABCD. First, I need to recall the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal, opposite sides are parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but the problem mentions points A, B, C, D forming a rhombus, so all sides AB, BC, CD, DA should be equal. 

Looking at the given predicates, there are several equations involving lengths. Let me parse them. It says AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. Then it also states that Var(x) equals 1. Oh, wait, they substitute Var(x) with 1, so maybe we can find the actual length of AB and BC? Let me check.

So if Var(x) is 1, then substituting into AB gives 2*1 + 3 = 5. And BC would be 5*1 = 5. Therefore, all sides are 5 units long. That confirms that ABCD is a rhombus because all sides are equal. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle AEB. Points E is the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but the problem also states that Angle(AEB) is a right angle? Wait, no—the given predicates say RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B))—so angle AEB is a right angle? But that seems conflicting with the property that diagonals intersect at right angles. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the point where they intersect, which is E here, creates four right angles. Therefore, angle AEB should be 90 degrees. But wait, the answer options include 90 as option C. However, let me make sure I'm not missing something here.

But wait, the problem gives us some specific info. Let me go back. The problem says that Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,D)). So the diagonals are perpendicular. Therefore, their intersection forms right angles. Hence, angle AEB is one of those right angles. So that would mean angle AEB is 90 degrees. So the answer should be C. 

But wait, let me confirm. Because sometimes people confuse the angles formed by the diagonals. For example, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. But the angle between the diagonals themselves is 90 degrees. So yes, angle AEB is 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C. 

Alternatively, maybe there's more to it. Let me check if there's another way this could be approached. Since all sides are 5, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Also, since E is the midpoint of both diagonals, because in a rhombus the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, AE is half of diagonal AC, BE is half of diagonal BD. But how does that relate to angle AEB?

Since diagonals are perpendicular, triangle AEB is a right triangle with legs AE and BE, and hypotenuse AB. Wait, but AB is 5. However, without knowing the lengths of the diagonals, can we compute the angle? Wait, but in this case, since the diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB is definitely 90 degrees. So regardless of the lengths of the diagonals, the angle between them is always 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle AEB is 90 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. Let me check if there's any possibility that the problem expects something else. For instance, if E were not the midpoint, but the given predicates state IsMidpointOf(Point(E), Line(A,C)) and IsMidpointOf(Point(E), Line(B,D)). So E is indeed the midpoint of both diagonals. Thus, confirming that diagonals bisect each other, hence the right angle. 

Yes, so all signs point to angle AEB being 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C.
