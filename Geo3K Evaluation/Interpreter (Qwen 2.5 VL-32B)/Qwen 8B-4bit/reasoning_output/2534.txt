<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of x given some conditions about triangles, lines, and parallelism. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, the problem mentions several points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There are lines connecting these points, like Line(A,B), Line(B,C), etc. Also, there are triangles mentioned, such as Triangle(A,B,C) and others. Then there are some specific properties: Right angles at certain angles, Parallel lines, Congruent segments, Similar triangles, and Equal lengths for some sides.

The main question is asking for x, where Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2). So, essentially, we need to find the length of AB, which is x - 2, so once we find AB's length, we add 2 to get x.

Looking at the given LengthOf equals: 

- LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = x - 2
- LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 5
- LengthOf(Line(C,D)) = 4
- LengthOf(Line(D,E)) = 10
- LengthOf(Line(E,F)) = 4
- LengthOf(Line(F,B)) = 5

Also, it says Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)). Since Line(D,E) has length 10 and Line(F,B) has length 5? Wait, wait—that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—wait, the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) means they have the same length. But according to the given data, Line(D,E) is 10 units, and Line(F,B) is 5 units. That would mean 10 equals 5? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: "Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B))". So, that implies that the lengths of Line(D,E) and Line(F,B) are equal. However, according to the given LengthOf(Line(D,E))=10 and LengthOf(Line(F,B))=5. That seems contradictory. Unless there's a mistake here. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me recheck the given predicates.

Looking back:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 5)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 4)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), 10)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), 4)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5)"

So, Line(D,E) has length 10, Line(F,B) has length 5. But the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) suggests they should be equal. This contradiction must mean I made a mistake in interpreting something. Or perhaps there's more to the problem?

Wait, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) refers to something else. Wait, no, Congruent here probably means the two line segments are congruent, i.e., same length. Therefore, if Line(D,E) is 10 and Line(F,B) is 5, they can't be congruent. So there's a contradiction here unless I misread the lengths. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the Line(F,B) isn't directly given as 5? Let me see:

Looking at the list:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5) — yes, that's stated explicitly. And Line(D,E) is 10. So how can they be congruent? That must mean there's another way these lines relate. Maybe there's a typo in my understanding?

Alternatively, perhaps the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is referring to another pair of lines. Wait, no—the Congruent predicate is applied to Line(D,E) and Line(F,B). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in inputting the problem. But assuming the problem is correctly presented, perhaps I need to look for other relations.

Wait, but there's also the fact that there's a Quadrilateral(D,E,B,F). So, DEBF is a quadrilateral. Given that Line(D,E) and Line(B,C) are part of this quadrilateral. Also, there's a mention of Parallel(Line(E,B), Line(D,C)). So, Line EB is parallel to Line DC. Which might be key here.

Let me think. Since Line EB || Line DC, maybe we can use properties of parallelograms or similar triangles. Also, since there's a similarity between Triangle(A,E,B) and Triangle(A,D,C), which is given as Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)). So, those two triangles are similar.

Given that similarity, corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are proportional. Let me note down the triangles:

Triangle(A,E,B) ~ Triangle(A,D,C). So, the correspondence of vertices is A → A, E → D, B → C. Because the order matters in similarity. So, vertex A corresponds to itself, E corresponds to D, B corresponds to C. Therefore, angle at A is common. So, angle EAB corresponds to angle DAC. Also, angle AEB corresponds to angle ADC, and angle ABE corresponds to angle ACD.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. For example, AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC.

But we need to find AB's length, which is x - 2. Let's see if we can find ratios involving AB and other sides.

But first, let me check the sides. Let's consider the sides of the triangles:

In Triangle(A,E,B), the sides are AE, EB, AB.

In Triangle(A,D,C), the sides are AD, DC, AC.

Because of similarity, AE / AD = EB / DC = AB / AC.

We know from the given lengths:

From earlier, Line(D,E) is 10 units. Wait, Line(D,E) is one side of the quadrilateral DEBF. Also, Line(E,F) is 4, Line(F,B) is 5. Also, Line(B,C) is 5. Let me try to visualize the diagram.

But perhaps focusing on the similar triangles. Let's denote:

Let’s denote the similarity ratio as k. So, AE / AD = EB / DC = AB / AC = k.

But we need to find AB. To do that, we might need expressions involving other sides.

Alternatively, perhaps using the given that Line EB is parallel to Line DC. Since EB || DC, then maybe we can form a trapezoid or use the property that alternate interior angles are equal, leading to similar triangles.

Wait, but we already have the similarity between the triangles. So combining that with the parallel lines.

Alternatively, considering the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate lengths?

Alternatively, since there are right angles given. The RightAngle(Angle(F,D,E)), RightAngle(Angle(F,B,C)), RightAngle(Angle(E,A,B)), RightAngle(Angle(G,A,D)). So four right angles. Let me think about that.

For instance, Angle(F,D,E) is a right angle. So, at point D, between points F, D, E. Similarly, Angle(F,B,C) is a right angle at point B between F, B, C. Also, Angle(E,A,B) is a right angle at point A between E, A, B. And Angle(G,A,D) is a right angle at point A between G, A, D.

This suggests that several right triangles exist here.

Moreover, there's a RightAngle(Angle(G,A,D)), so triangle AGD is a right triangle at A. Also, since Line(A,G) and Line(G,D) are present, forming a right angle at A.

Now, considering the similarity between Triangle(A,E,B) and Triangle(A,D,C). Since they are similar, and given that there are right angles involved.

Wait, let's look at Triangle(A,E,B): it has a right angle at A because Angle(E,A,B) is a right angle. So, Triangle(A,E,B) is a right triangle with right angle at A. Similarly, Triangle(A,D,C): does it have a right angle? Well, if the similarity holds, and if the corresponding angles are right angles, then Triangle(A,D,C) should also have a right angle at A. But looking at the given angles, there's a RightAngle(Angle(G,A,D)), which involves point G, but not necessarily related to Triangle(A,D,C).

Wait, maybe the right angle is at point A for Triangle(A,D,C)? Let me think. If Triangle(A,D,C) is similar to Triangle(A,E,B), and Triangle(A,E,B) is right-angled at A, then Triangle(A,D,C) must also be right-angled at A. So, angle at A between D and C is a right angle. Therefore, Line AD is perpendicular to Line AC? Wait, but Line AD and Line AC may not necessarily be connected. Wait, the triangle is A-D-C, so the sides are AD, DC, and AC. If it's right-angled at A, then AD is perpendicular to AC. But we don't know if that's true yet.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at another vertex. Wait, but the similarity would imply that the right angle is at the corresponding vertex. Since Triangle(A,E,B) has its right angle at A, then Triangle(A,D,C) must have its right angle at A as well. Hence, angle at A between D and C is a right angle. So, AD ⊥ AC. But I need to verify that.

Assuming that, then Triangle(A,E,B) and Triangle(A,D,C) are both right-angled at A, making them similar. So, their legs correspond.

So, for Triangle(A,E,B), legs are AE and AB, hypotenuse EB.

For Triangle(A,D,C), legs are AD and AC, hypotenuse DC.

Since they are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal.

Therefore, AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC.

We can write that as:

AE / AD = EB / DC.

But we need to find AB. Let's see if we can express AE, AD, EB, DC in terms of known quantities.

From the given, DC is Line(D,C) which has length 4 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 4)). Wait, Line(C,D) is the same as Line(D,C), so DC is 4 units long. So DC = 4.

EB is the length of Line(E,B). Looking at the given, Line(E,F) is 4 and Line(F,B) is 5. Also, Line(E,B) is part of the quadrilateral DEBF. Since DEBF is a quadrilateral, and Line(E,B) connects E to B.

But how long is Line(E,B)?

Wait, but we can compute EB using the given data. Let me think. Since Line(E,F) is 4 and Line(F,B) is 5, and if we can assume that points E-F-B are colinear? Wait, no. The Line(E,F) and Line(F,B) are separate lines unless specified otherwise. Wait, but Line(E,F) is from E to F, and Line(F,B) is from F to B. So, points E, F, B form a triangle or a straight line? Not sure yet.

However, there's a RightAngle at Angle(F,B,C). So, Angle(F,B,C) is a right angle. Therefore, at point B, between F, B, C. So, Line BF is perpendicular to Line BC. Since Line BC has length 5, and Line BF has length 5 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5)). So, Triangle FBC is a right triangle with legs FB=5 and BC=5, so hypotenuse FC would be sqrt(5² + 5²) = 5√2. But not sure if that helps yet.

But returning to the similarity ratio. We had:

AE / AD = EB / DC.

We know DC = 4. So, if we can find AE and AD, or EB, we can solve for the ratio.

But how?

Alternatively, since Line EB is parallel to Line DC, and from the given that they're parallel. So, EB || DC. In that case, perhaps there's a transversal or similar triangles formed by the parallel lines.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, then the distance between EB and DC could be considered, but without knowing heights, that might not help directly.

But since we have similar triangles, maybe we can use the ratio of sides.

Wait, but we also have that Line(D,E) is 10 units long. Which is DE = 10. Also, Line(F,B) is 5 units, and they are congruent because Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is given. Wait, earlier confusion arises here. Because DE is 10 and FB is 5. How can they be congruent? Unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I misread the Congruent predicate. Let me check again:

The given includes "Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B))".

So, this suggests that Line(D,E) and Line(F,B) are congruent, hence have the same length. But according to the given LengthOf(Line(D,E))=10 and LengthOf(Line(F,B))=5. This is conflicting. So either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I've misread something.

Wait, maybe Line(F,B) is not the same as Line(F,B)? No, that's the same segment. Wait, unless there's another segment named Line(F,B)? No, the Line(F,B) is unique.

Hmm. This inconsistency suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, but assuming the problem is correct, perhaps I need to reconcile this. Let me think: Could Line(F,B) refer to something else? Like, maybe there's a different line named Line(F,B) that is congruent to Line(D,E)?

Wait, the problem lists several Line predicates:

Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,B), Line(A,G), Line(G,D), Line(A,E), Line(E,B), Line(A,D), Line(D,C).

So, Line(F,B) is indeed one of them. And its length is given as 5. But Line(D,E) is 10. So unless there's a mistake in the problem, this seems impossible. Perhaps the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is actually referring to another pair of lines?

Wait, the problem states "Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B))", but maybe it's a typo and should be Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,C))? Or another line?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Line(D,E) is congruent to Line(F,B), implying that their lengths are equal, so 10 = 5, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, but maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is not about their lengths, but about something else? Like being congruent as line segments, which requires both length and orientation? But even then, the lengths would still need to be equal.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses Congruent in the sense of being congruent figures, not just line segments. But even then, the lengths must match.

This is confusing. Let me try to proceed despite this contradiction, possibly assuming that there's a miscalculation elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is a red herring, and the actual lengths are as given. But then why is that predicate included? It might be that the problem intended for Line(F,B) to have length 10 instead of 5. Let me check the original input again.

Original input:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5)" – yes, that's explicit.

And "Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B))" – which would require DE = FB, but DE is 10 and FB is 5. Contradiction. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, and Line(F,B) should have length 10? Or Line(D,E) should be 5? Without further info, it's hard to say. But assuming the problem is correct, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Line(F,B) is not the entire segment but part of a longer segment? For example, if Line(F,B) is part of another line, but the length given is only part of it. But the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5), which refers to the entire segment.

Alternatively, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) refers to something else, like direction, not length. But congruence of line segments usually refers to length.

This contradiction is problematic. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret this. Suppose that the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is a mistake, and it's supposed to be Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,C))? Let's check the length of Line(F,C). Wait, Line(F,C) is not listed among the given lines. The given lines are up to Line(F,B). So, perhaps it's a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is correct, and the given length of Line(F,B) is wrong. Assuming that, maybe the correct length is 10, matching Line(D,E)'s length. So, perhaps the given Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 5) is incorrect, and it should be Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 10). Let me tentatively assume that, to resolve the contradiction, and proceed.

Assume that Line(F,B) has length 10. Then, since DE and FB are congruent (both 10), that aligns. Now, moving forward with this assumption.

Now, back to the similarity between Triangle(A,E,B) and Triangle(A,D,C). As previously thought, since they are similar, and both are right-angled at A.

So, Triangle(A,E,B) has legs AE and AB, hypotenuse EB.

Triangle(A,D,C) has legs AD and AC, hypotenuse DC.

Their similarity ratio is AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC.

We know DC is 4, as per the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) = 4. So DC = 4.

Now, we need to find EB. Let's see if we can compute EB.

EB is the length of Line(E,B). Let me try to find EB using other information.

Points E, F, B are connected via Line(E,F) and Line(F,B). From the given, Line(E,F) has length 4, and Line(F,B) has length 10 (assuming corrected). So, if points E-F-B are colinear, then EB would be EF + FB = 4 + 10 = 14. But is that the case?

Wait, but the problem states that Line(E,F) and Line(F,B) are separate lines. Unless points E, F, B are colinear, which would make EB a straight line passing through F. However, we don't have information confirming that. But there's a RightAngle at Angle(F,B,C), which suggests that at point B, lines FB and BC are perpendicular. Also, Line(B,C) has length 5. So, if FB is 10 and BC is 5, and they are perpendicular, then triangle FBC is a right triangle with legs 10 and 5, so hypotenuse FC would be sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(125) = 5√5. But how does this help us with EB?

Alternatively, if E, F, B are not colinear, then EB is not simply the sum of EF and FB. But we need more information to find EB.

Wait, but there's also the fact that Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C). Since EB || DC, and DC is 4 units long. If we can find the length of EB using the properties of similar triangles or parallelograms.

Wait, since EB || DC, and if we can find the ratio of similarity between the triangles, maybe we can relate EB and DC.

Earlier, we had the similarity ratio AE/AD = EB/DC. If we can find AE and AD, then we can find EB.

Let me try to find AE and AD.

Looking at the given lines, Line(A,E) is given, with length? Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(A,E)) is not directly provided. Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = x - 2, Line(B,C)=5, Line(C,D)=4, Line(D,E)=10, Line(E,F)=4, Line(F,B)=10 (assumed correction), and others.

Wait, Line(A,E) is part of Triangle(A,E,B), which is right-angled at A. So, if we can find AE and AB, which are the legs of that triangle, and EB is the hypotenuse.

But we don't know AE or AB yet. However, we might find AE from other parts.

Looking at Line(A,D), which is given as part of the quadrilateral DEBF? Or not sure. Let me check.

There's a Quadrilateral(D,E,B,F). So, points D-E-B-F connected in order. So, DE, EB, BF, FD are the sides. Wait, but Line(D,E) is given as 10, Line(E,B) is what we're trying to find, Line(B,F) is 10 (assuming), and Line(F,D) is...? Let me check if Line(F,D) is given. The given lines include Line(F,D)? No, the given lines are up to Line(F,B), and Line(F,D) is not listed. Wait, but there's a Line(F,D) in the quadrilateral? Or maybe not.

Wait, the quadrilateral is D-E-B-F, so the sides are DE, EB, BF, and FD. So, Line(F,D) would be the fourth side, connecting F to D. Is there any information about Line(F,D)? The given includes Line(F,B) and Line(D,E), etc. But not Line(F,D). However, there's a Congruent(Line(E,B), Line(D,F)) given. Ah! Yes, the predicate says "Congruent(Line(E,B), Line(D,F))". So, Line(E,B) is congruent to Line(D,F), meaning their lengths are equal. So, if Line(E,B) has length y, then Line(D,F) also has length y.

So, if we can find Line(D,F), maybe we can relate it to other parts.

But how?

Let me try to summarize:

- DE = 10
- EB = ? (let's call it y)
- BF = 10 (assumed correction)
- FD = y (because congruent to EB)

So, the quadrilateral DEBF has sides DE=10, EB=y, BF=10, FD=y.

Additionally, there's a RightAngle at Angle(F,D,E), which is the angle at D between F, D, E. So, angle FDE is a right angle. So, in the quadrilateral DEBF, angle at D is a right angle. Therefore, DEBF is a right-angled quadrilateral at D. So, it's a rectangle? Or a right trapezoid? Because if one angle is right, but not necessarily others.

But since DE and BF are opposite sides (if DEBF is a trapezoid), and DE is 10, BF is 10, and FD and EB are y. With angle at D being right, this suggests that DE is perpendicular to FD. So, FD is perpendicular to DE. Thus, FD is vertical if DE is horizontal, etc.

But how does this help us find y?

Well, since DE and BF are both 10, and FD and EB are both y, and angle at D is right, then DEBF is a rectangle? No, because only one right angle is mentioned. But if DE is perpendicular to FD, and if BF is perpendicular to FD (since angle at B?), but we don't know about other angles.

But maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem on some triangles.

Alternatively, since DEBF has a right angle at D, and DE=10, FD=y, then DF is perpendicular to DE. So, triangle DFE is a right triangle? No, because F is connected to D and E. Wait, no, F is connected to D and B. So, point F is connected to D and B. But angle at D is between F, D, E, which is right. So, DF is perpendicular to DE.

Thus, in triangle DFE, which is right-angled at D, with DE=10 and DF=y, then FE would be the hypotenuse. But FE is given as 4 (from Line(E,F) = 4). Wait, Line(E,F) is 4, which is the same as FE. So, applying Pythagoras to triangle DFE:

DF² + DE² = FE²

y² + 10² = 4²

y² + 100 = 16

y² = 16 - 100 = -84

Which is impossible. So, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, our assumption must be wrong.

Wait, this suggests that the previous assumption about Line(F,B) having length 10 is incorrect. So, going back, if Line(F,B) is indeed 5, and Line(DE) is 10, then the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is invalid. Hence, there must be another explanation.

Perhaps the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) refers to something else? Like, not their lengths but their slopes or directions? But congruence of line segments typically refers to length.

Alternatively, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is referring to the fact that they are congruent as vectors, meaning same length and direction? But again, this would require their lengths to be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is a typo and should be Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,C)) or another line. Let's try assuming it's Line(F,C) instead. If that's the case, then Line(F,C) would need to have length 10. But we don't have information about Line(F,C) in the given predicates.

Alternatively, maybe the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) is a misstatement, and it should be Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,D)), which would make sense if FD is congruent to DE. Let me try that.

If Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,D)), then FD = DE = 10. Then, in the quadrilateral DEBF, FD = 10, DE = 10, BF = 5 (original given), and EB = ?. Let's try this scenario.

With FD = 10, DE = 10, and angle at D is right, then triangle DFE would have legs DE=10 and DF=10, making FE = sqrt(10² + 10²) = 10√2 ≈ 14.14. But the given FE is 4, which contradicts. So this is also impossible.

Hmm. This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the problem setup. But since this is a math problem, there must be a resolution. Let me try a different approach, ignoring the Congruent(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)) for now and focus on other parts.

Back to the similarity between Triangles AEB and ADC. Both are right-angled at A. So, their sides are proportional.

Let me denote:

In Triangle AEB: AE, AB, EB (right-angled at A)

In Triangle ADC: AD, AC, DC (right-angled at A)

So, the similarity gives:

AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC

We know DC = 4 (from Line(C,D) = 4). Let's denote EB as y, then:

AE / AD = y / 4

But we need to relate AE and AD.

Let me look for other information. There's a Line(A,D) and Line(A,E). Are their lengths given? Let me check the given LengthOf predicates.

The given LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = x - 2

Line(B,C) = 5

Line(C,D) = 4

Line(D,E) = 10

Line(E,F) = 4

Line(F,B) = 5

Other lines: Line(A,G), Line(G,D), Line(A,E), Line(E,B), Line(A,D), Line(D,C).

So, Line(A,D) and Line(A,E) are not directly given their lengths. But perhaps we can find them through other relationships.

For example, Line(A,E) is part of Triangle(A,E,B), which is right-angled at A. So, AE and AB are the legs, and EB is the hypotenuse.

Similarly, Line(A,D) is part of Triangle(A,D,C), which is right-angled at A, so AD and AC are the legs, DC is the hypotenuse.

But how to find AE and AD?

Wait, there's also a RightAngle at Angle(G,A,D), which means that Line(G,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,D). So, Triangle AGD is a right triangle at A. So, AG and AD are legs, GD is hypotenuse.

But we don't know the lengths of AG or GD.

Alternatively, since Line(A,G) and Line(G,D) are present, maybe we can find some relationship. But without more information about these lines, it's unclear.

Another thought: since Line(D,E) is 10, and Line(D,C) is 4, and Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C), which is 4. So, maybe there's a proportionality due to the parallel lines.

Since EB || DC, and if we can find the ratio of distances or something.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, and if we can consider the transversal AD, creating similar triangles.

Wait, since EB || DC, and if A is a point outside these lines, maybe we can form similar triangles.

Imagine extending lines to form triangles. For example, if we draw AD and AE, and since EB || DC, then maybe Triangle AEB is similar to some other triangle.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try using the similarity between Triangles AEB and ADC.

We have AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC = y / 4.

But we need more equations to solve for variables.

Let me consider the other given information: Line(A,B) has length x - 2, and Line(B,C) is 5, Line(C,D) is 4, Line(D,E) is 10, Line(E,F) is 4, Line(F,B) is 5.

Also, there's a RightAngle at Angle(F,B,C), making Triangle FBC a right triangle with legs FB=5 and BC=5, so hypotenuse FC = 5√2.

But how does this relate to other parts?

Maybe looking at Point G. Line(A,G) and Line(G,D) are present, with a RightAngle at A. So, AG is perpendicular to AD.

If I can assign coordinates to the points, maybe I can calculate everything.

Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let's place Point A at (0,0) since there are right angles at A.

Since Angle(E,A,B) is a right angle, so AE and AB are perpendicular. Let's assume AE is along the y-axis and AB is along the x-axis.

So, let's set:

Point A at (0,0).

Let’s define Point E somewhere on the y-axis: E = (0, e).

Point B is on the x-axis: B = (b, 0).

Then, Line(A,B) has length b, since from (0,0) to (b,0). According to the given, this length is x - 2, so b = x - 2.

Now, Line(A,E) has length e, since from (0,0) to (0,e).

Now, Triangle(A,E,B) is right-angled at A, with legs AE = e and AB = b, hypotenuse EB.

EB's length is sqrt(e² + b²).

Now, Triangle(A,D,C) is similar to Triangle(A,E,B), so it's also right-angled at A. Let's assume AD is along some direction, but since it's similar, the configuration might mirror.

But to find coordinates for D and C, let's consider.

Since Line(D,E) has length 10. Point D is connected to E, and Line(D,E) is from D to E. Also, Line(D,C) has length 4, and Line(C,D) is 4.

Also, Line(D,E) is part of the quadrilateral DEBF, and Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C).

Let me try to find coordinates for D and C.

Since Line(D,E) is from D to E. Let's assume D has coordinates (d_x, d_y), and E is (0, e).

So, vector DE is (0 - d_x, e - d_y). The length of DE is 10, so:

sqrt((d_x)^2 + (e - d_y)^2) = 10.

Also, Line(D,C) has length 4. Let's say Point C is connected to D, and Line(C,D) is 4.

But without knowing where C is, it's challenging. Let me think about the other information.

Line(C,D) is 4, and Line(D,E) is 10. Also, Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C).

Since Line(E,B) is from E(0,e) to B(b,0). The slope of EB is (0 - e)/(b - 0) = -e/b.

Line(D,C) is parallel to this, so it has the same slope. Let's say Point D is (d_x, d_y), and Point C is (c_x, c_y). Then, the slope of DC is (c_y - d_y)/(c_x - d_x) = -e/b.

Also, the length of DC is 4.

But this is getting complicated with too many variables. Maybe there's a better way.

Since Triangle(A,D,C) is similar to Triangle(A,E,B), and both are right-angled at A. So, the ratio of similarity is AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC.

Let me denote the similarity ratio as k = AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC.

We know DC = 4, so EB = k * 4.

But EB is also the hypotenuse of Triangle AEB, which is sqrt(AE² + AB²) = sqrt(e² + b²).

So, sqrt(e² + b²) = k * 4.

Also, since AE = e and AB = b, then k = e / AD = b / AC.

But I need to relate AD and AC.

Let me consider Line(A,D). Since Point D is connected to E, and Line(D,E) is 10. Let me try to find AD.

Assuming Point D is somewhere such that Line(D,E) is 10. But without knowing its position, it's hard. However, since Line(D,C) is 4 and parallel to Line(E,B), maybe we can use the slope.

The slope of Line(E,B) is -e/b, as before. Line(D,C) has the same slope. Let me assume Point C is along the direction determined by this slope.

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try to use the similarity ratio.

From the similarity, since Triangle AEB ~ Triangle ADC, and both are right-angled at A, then:

AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC.

Let me denote AE = e, AB = b, DC = 4, EB = sqrt(e² + b²).

So, from AE/AD = EB/DC => e/AD = sqrt(e² + b²)/4 => AD = (4e)/sqrt(e² + b²).

Similarly, AB/AC = EB/DC => b/AC = sqrt(e² + b²)/4 => AC = (4b)/sqrt(e² + b²).

Now, what is AC? AC is the length from A(0,0) to C. But Point C is connected to D via Line(C,D) of length 4, and Line(D,E) is 10.

But without knowing the position of C, it's difficult. However, since Line(D,C) has length 4 and is parallel to Line(E,B), which has slope -e/b.

Let me assume that Point C is located such that Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B). Let me suppose that Point D is somewhere, and Point C is obtained by moving from D in the direction of Line(E,B) for length 4.

But this requires knowing the direction, which depends on the slope.

Alternatively, since Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B), and Line(D,E) is 10, maybe there's a relation between these.

But this is getting too tangled. Let me think differently. Since we have the RightAngle at Angle(G,A,D), which is at A between G and D. So, Line(G,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,D). Since Line(A,G) and Line(G,D) are given, and Line(A,G) is from A(0,0) to G, and Line(G,D) is from G to D. Since they form a right angle at A, then Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(A,D). So, if Line(A,D) has some slope, Line(A,G) has the negative reciprocal slope.

But again, without knowing where G is, it's hard to use this.

Let me try to focus on the equation from the similarity ratio.

From earlier, we have:

AD = (4e)/sqrt(e² + b²)

But also, Line(D,E) has length 10. Let's express this in terms of e and b.

Assume Point D is somewhere such that the distance from D to E is 10. But without knowing D's coordinates, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to express D in terms of other points.

Alternatively, since Line(D,E) is 10, and Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C), which is 4. Maybe the ratio of lengths DE/DC = 10/4 = 5/2, and since they are parallel, this might relate to the similarity ratio.

Wait, DE is 10, DC is 4, and they are parallel. If there's a transversal, maybe creating similar triangles.

But I'm not seeing it directly.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, and if we consider the triangles formed by these lines.

Wait, if EB || DC, and if we draw a line from A to D, and A to E, maybe there's a parallelogram or something.

But without more information, it's challenging.

Let me go back to the equation from the similarity ratio. We have:

EB = sqrt(e² + b²) = k * 4, where k is the similarity ratio.

Also, from the similarity, AE/AD = k => e / AD = k => AD = e/k.

But from above, AD = (4e)/sqrt(e² + b²) = e/k => k = sqrt(e² + b²)/4.

So, substituting k = sqrt(e² + b²)/4 into AD = e/k, we get:

AD = e / (sqrt(e² + b²)/4) = (4e)/sqrt(e² + b²).

But this is consistent.

Now, what is AC? From the similarity, AC = (4b)/sqrt(e² + b²).

But AC is the length from A to C. Let me think about Point C. Line(C,D) is 4, and Line(D,E) is 10. Also, Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B).

Let me assume that Point C is such that Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B). So, the vector from D to C is the same direction as the vector from E to B.

Vector EB is B - E = (b, 0) - (0, e) = (b, -e).

So, vector EB is (b, -e). So, vector DC should be parallel to this, meaning it's a scalar multiple of (b, -e).

Let me denote vector DC = t*(b, -e), where t is some scalar.

Since the length of DC is 4, then |t|*sqrt(b² + e²) = 4 => t = ±4/sqrt(b² + e²).

So, vector DC = (4b/sqrt(b² + e²), -4e/sqrt(b² + e²)).

But vector DC is C - D. So, if I can express D in terms of other points, but I don't know D's location.

But since Line(D,E) has length 10, and E is at (0, e), let's assume D has coordinates (x_d, y_d). Then, the distance from D to E is sqrt((x_d - 0)^2 + (y_d - e)^2) = 10.

Also, vector DC is (4b/sqrt(b² + e²), -4e/sqrt(b² + e²)).

So, C = D + vector DC = (x_d + 4b/sqrt(b² + e²), y_d - 4e/sqrt(b² + e²)).

But also, Line(C,D) has length 4, which we already used.

But how does this help us? Maybe we need to connect this with other parts.

Alternatively, since Line(C,D) is part of Triangle ADC, which is right-angled at A. So, Point C must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, Triangle ADC is right-angled at A, so AC is perpendicular to AD. So, the vectors AC and AD are perpendicular.

Vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(x_c, y_c): (x_c, y_c).

Vector AD is from A(0,0) to D(x_d, y_d): (x_d, y_d).

Their dot product should be zero: x_c * x_d + y_c * y_d = 0.

But C is expressed in terms of D and the vector DC.

From earlier, C = D + vector DC = (x_d + 4b/sqrt(b² + e²), y_d - 4e/sqrt(b² + e²)).

So, x_c = x_d + 4b/sqrt(b² + e²), y_c = y_d - 4e/sqrt(b² + e²).

Substituting into the dot product:

x_c * x_d + y_c * y_d = 0

=> [x_d + 4b/sqrt(b² + e²)] * x_d + [y_d - 4e/sqrt(b² + e²)] * y_d = 0

Expanding:

x_d² + (4b x_d)/sqrt(b² + e²) + y_d² - (4e y_d)/sqrt(b² + e²) = 0

Group terms:

(x_d² + y_d²) + (4/sqrt(b² + e²))(bx_d - ey_d) = 0

But x_d² + y_d² is the square of the distance from A to D, which is AD². From earlier, AD = (4e)/sqrt(b² + e²). So, AD² = 16e²/(b² + e²).

Substituting:

16e²/(b² + e²) + (4/sqrt(b² + e²))(bx_d - ey_d) = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(b² + e²):

16e² / sqrt(b² + e²) + 4(bx_d - ey_d) = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

4e² / sqrt(b² + e²) + bx_d - ey_d = 0

But this introduces new variables x_d and y_d, which are the coordinates of D. We also know that the distance from D to E is 10:

x_d² + (y_d - e)^2 = 100

But this seems too complex to solve without additional constraints.

At this point, I realize I'm stuck in a loop without enough information. Perhaps I need to revisit the initial assumptions or look for another approach.

Let me recall that the problem asks for x, which is AB + 2, since AB = x - 2. If I can find AB, I can find x.

Let me try to find AB using the similarity and other given lengths.

From the similarity, we have:

EB = k * 4, where k = AE/AD = AB/AC.

Also, EB = sqrt(AE² + AB²) = sqrt(e² + b²).

So, sqrt(e² + b²) = k * 4.

But also, from the similarity, k = AE/AD = e/AD.

And from earlier, AD = 4e / sqrt(e² + b²).

So, k = e / (4e / sqrt(e² + b²)) = sqrt(e² + b²)/4.

Thus, this is consistent.

But how to find e and b?

Maybe using other given lengths. For example, Line(F,B) is 5, and Line(F,E) is 4, and Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C) which is 4. Let me think about triangle FBE.

If Line(F,B) is 5, Line(E,F) is 4, and Line(E,B) is y (which is EB), then triangle EFB has sides 4, 5, and y. But we don't know if it's a right triangle. However, there's a RightAngle at Angle(F,B,C), which is at point B between F, B, C. So, at point B, Line BF is perpendicular to Line BC. Since Line BC is 5, and Line BF is 5, this forms a right isosceles triangle, making FC = 5√2. But how does
