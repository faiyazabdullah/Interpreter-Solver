MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle ABC, right? The problem gives us some angles and asks for the measure of angle at point B, which is labeled as x. Let me parse the given information carefully.

First, the predicates mention Triangle(A, B, C), so points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there are Line(A, B), Line(B, C), and Line(C, A), which confirms that these three points are connected to form the sides of the triangle. 

Next, the angles mentioned are Angle(A, B, C), Angle(C, A, B), and Angle(B, C, A). Wait, I need to make sure I understand how these angles are defined. In standard notation, Angle(X, Y, Z) typically refers to the angle at vertex Y formed by points X-Y-Z. So, Angle(A, B, C) would be the angle at point B between points A and C. Similarly, Angle(C, A, B) is the angle at point A between points C and B. And Angle(B, C, A) is the angle at point C between points B and A. 

Now, the measures given are Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)), 52) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)), 35). Translating that, the angle at point A (since it's Angle(C, A, B)) is 52 degrees, and the angle at point C (Angle(B, C, A)) is 35 degrees. The third angle, which is at point B (Angle(A, B, C)), is denoted as x. 

The SumOf predicate says that the sum of these three angles equals 180 degrees. That's the triangle angle sum theorem, which states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. So, if we add up the three angles, they should total 180. 

So, putting it together: angle at A is 52°, angle at C is 35°, and angle at B is x. Therefore, 52 + 35 + x = 180. Solving for x, we subtract the sum of 52 and 35 from 180. Let me calculate that. 

52 plus 35 is 87. Then, 180 minus 87 is 93. So x equals 93 degrees. Now, looking at the answer choices, option D is 93. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes angles can be confusing depending on how they're labeled. Let me confirm again. The angle at A is Angle(C, A, B), which is indeed the angle at A between C and B. Similarly, Angle(B, C, A) is the angle at C between B and A. So those two angles are at A and C respectively. So yes, adding them with the angle at B gives the total. So 52 + 35 + x = 180 → x = 180 - 87 = 93. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is D.
