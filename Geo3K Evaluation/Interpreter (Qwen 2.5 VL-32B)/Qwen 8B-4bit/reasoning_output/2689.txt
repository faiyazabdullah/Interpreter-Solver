====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand how they form the figure. There are several rectangles mentioned, points connected by lines, and various length equalities. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have two main rectangles: Rectangle(A, B, C, D) and Rectangle(E, F, G, H). Also, there's another rectangle mentioned as Rectangle(D, C, E, A), which suggests that these four points form another rectangle. Then there are more rectangles like Rectangle(A, B, G, F) and others. Additionally, there are lines connecting points like A to B, B to C, etc., forming sides of rectangles. 

Looking at the lengths: All the sides of the rectangles seem to have lengths specified. For example, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals 5, same for other sides of the first rectangle. Similarly, the second rectangle has sides of length 5 as well. However, there are also some shorter segments mentioned, like LengthOf(Line(A,F)) equals 2, and others like that. These shorter segments probably connect different parts of the rectangles.

Now, considering the perpendicular and parallel relationships. Lines AB and CD are parallel, as are AB and EF, EF and GH, CD and GH. Also, lines AE, BF, CG, DH are all perpendicular to their respective sides. This seems to indicate that the entire figure might be composed of interconnected rectangles, possibly forming a larger composite shape.

Wait, since there are multiple rectangles overlapping, maybe the figure is a combination of smaller rectangles arranged in a way that their perimeters overlap? But the question asks for the perimeter of the entire figure, so we need to consider the outer edges without double-counting internal sides.

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose we have two large squares (since all sides are equal) connected by smaller rectangles. Wait, but the lengths vary. For instance, the sides of the big rectangles are length 5, while some connecting lines are length 2. Maybe it's a 3D-like structure projected onto 2D, but the problem doesn't mention 3D. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is made up of two squares connected by smaller rectangles, creating a larger shape with certain sides combined.

But wait, looking at the points: Points A, B, C, D form one rectangle, and E, F, G, H form another. Then there's a rectangle D, C, E, A, which connects those two rectangles. So, points D, C, E, A form a rectangle. That would mean that DC and EA are opposite sides, and CE and DA are the other pair. Since DC is part of the original rectangle ABCD, and EA connects to point E. Also, there's a rectangle A, B, G, F, implying that AF is a side of length 2, and FB is also 2. Similarly, other small rectangles connect the larger ones.

This seems complicated, but maybe the entire figure is a larger square or rectangle with some internal divisions. Let me think about the total perimeter. To find the perimeter, I need to calculate the sum of all outer edges.

First, note that each of the large rectangles (ABCD and EFGH) has a perimeter of 4*5=20, but since they are connected, some sides are shared. However, the presence of other rectangles complicates things. Also, the smaller rectangles (like A, B, G, F) add more connections. 

Alternatively, maybe the entire figure forms a single polygon whose perimeter can be calculated by adding up the unique outer edges. Let me check the connections again.

Each line segment listed represents a side of a rectangle. For example, Line(A,B) is part of rectangle ABCD and also part of rectangle ABGF. Since AB is length 5, but there's another line AF of length 2. So, point F is connected to A and B. Similarly, BF is length 2. So, the rectangle ABGF has sides AB=5, BF=2, FG=?, and GA=?

Wait, but Rectangle(A,B,G,F) implies that AB and GF are opposite sides, and BG and AF are the other pair. So, AB = GF = 5, and BF = AG = 2. Therefore, GF is length 5, which is part of the original rectangle EFGH. Wait, but earlier, Line(E,F) is length 5, so EFGH is a square? Because all sides are 5. But then there's a line from F to G of length 5, and from G to H of 5, etc. But then there's also a line from D to H of length 2. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, the Line(D,H) is stated to have length 2. But D is part of the original rectangle ABCD, where DC is length 5. So, D is connected to H via a line of length 2. How does that fit?

Perhaps the figure isn't just two separate squares but a more complex arrangement. Let me try to sketch mentally. 

Starting with rectangle ABCD: AB=BC=CD=DA=5. Then, rectangle EFGH: EF=FG=GH=HE=5. Now, the rectangle DCGE (assuming the rectangle D,C,E,A is actually DCGE?) Wait, the predicate says Rectangle(D, C, E, A), so points D, C, E, A form a rectangle. So, DC and EA are opposite sides, and CE and DA are the other pair. Since DC is 5, then EA should also be 5. But EA is part of the line from E to A. Wait, but there's a line from A to E, which is given as Line(A,E). What's its length? Well, the length of Line(A,E) isn't directly given, but there are other lines connected to it. For example, Line(A,F) is length 2, Line(F,B) is 2, Line(B,G) is 2, Line(G,C) is 2. So, AF=FB=BG=GC=2. 

So, starting from A, moving to B (length 5), then from B to F (length 2), then F to G (length 2?), but wait, the length of Line(F,G) is 5, according to the given predicates. Wait, the Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), 5) is given. So, that's part of the rectangle EFGH, making EF=FG=GH=HE=5. But then, how do the lines AF, FB, BG, GC relate?

Since AF=2 and FB=2, that suggests that point F is somewhere along the line from A to B such that AF + FB = AB. But AB is length 5, and AF + FB = 2+2=4, which is less than 5. Wait, that can't be. Unless F is not on AB but connected via another line. Wait, the line from A to F is given, and F is connected to B. So, points A-F-B form a straight line? Or not necessarily? Wait, the Line(A,F) and Line(B,F) exist, which means that F is connected to both A and B. So, AF and BF are sides of the rectangle ABGF. Since ABGF is a rectangle, then AF and BG are opposite sides, and AB and FG are opposite sides. Therefore, AF = BG = 2, and AB = FG = 5. Which fits because AB is 5, FG is part of the rectangle EFGH, which has FG=5. So that works.

Similarly, Line(B,G) is length 2, which is BG. Then, Line(C,G) is length 2, which would be CG. And Line(D,H) is length 2. So, each of these short lines connects adjacent corners of the large rectangles to form smaller rectangles.

Putting this together, the entire figure may consist of two large squares (ABCD and EFGH) connected by smaller rectangles. For example, the rectangle ABGF connects AB (from the first square) to FG (from the second square). Similarly, other rectangles connect the other sides.

Now, to compute the perimeter of the entire figure, we need to account for all outer edges. Let's imagine the figure as follows:

- The outermost shape is formed by combining the two large squares with the smaller rectangles. Each connection between the squares adds new edges. However, since some sides are internal (shared between rectangles), they shouldn't be counted twice.

But perhaps the entire figure is a larger rectangle? Let me see. For example, if we have two squares of size 5x5, connected in such a way that their sides are aligned. However, with the addition of the smaller rectangles, maybe it's a larger composite shape.

Alternatively, since there are multiple rectangles, maybe the overall figure is a 5x7 rectangle? Let me think. Let's look at the horizontal and vertical dimensions.

Take point A connected to B (length 5), and point E connected to F (also length 5). Then, the line from A to E is connected. From previous info, the length of AE is not given, but since there are perpendicular relationships, maybe AE is vertical or horizontal relative to AB. Given that Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,E)), meaning that AB and AE are perpendicular. So, if AB is horizontal, AE is vertical. Similarly, BC is perpendicular to BF, etc.

Assuming AB is horizontal, then AE is vertical upwards from A. Then, since AF is length 2, and F is connected to B, which is 2 units away from B. Wait, AF is vertical from A, and FB is horizontal from B. Wait, no—if AB is horizontal, then BF would be vertical if it's perpendicular. Wait, the Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,F)). Since BC is horizontal (as part of rectangle ABCD), then BF is vertical. So, from point B, going upward to F, which is 2 units long. Similarly, from point C, CG is vertical upwards (since Perpendicular(Line(C,D), Line(C,G)), so CG is vertical. And from D, DH is vertical upwards, length 2.

So, putting this together, the entire figure could be a larger rectangle formed by extending the vertical sides of the large squares. Let's think about the height. The vertical dimension from A to E would be... Well, AE is connected to F, which is 2 units above B. Wait, but how tall is the entire figure?

From point A, moving vertically upwards via AE to point E. But the line AE's length isn't directly given. However, since there are other vertical segments: AF=2, BG=2, CH=2, etc. Wait, but AF is part of the rectangle ABGF, which has AF=2 and BG=2. Similarly, from point C, CG=2, and from D, DH=2. So, the vertical segments from each corner of the large square extend upward by 2 units. Thus, the total vertical height of the entire figure would be the height of the large square plus the extension from each side. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, considering that the two large squares are connected via these vertical extensions. Let me try to imagine stacking them. Suppose the original square ABCD has side length 5. Then, each side extends outward by 2 units. For example, from point A, going up 2 units to F; from point B, up 2 units to F (but wait, that would make AF and BF both 2 units, but F is connected to both A and B, so that would imply that F is 2 units above A and 2 units above B, but since AB is 5 units long horizontally, this would place F outside the square ABCD. Similarly, from point C, CG is 2 units up, and from D, DH is 2 units up. 

But then, the rectangle EFGH is another square of side 5, connected via these vertical lines. So, EFGH is shifted upward by 2 units compared to ABCD? Not sure yet. 

To compute the perimeter, I need to identify all the outer edges. Let's break down the components:

1. The left side: From A to D (length 5) and from D to H (length 2). Wait, but D is connected to H, which is part of the rectangle D, C, E, A. So, DH is length 2. Then, from H to E (part of EFGH's side HE, which is length 5). From E to A (some length). Wait, but E is connected to A via the line EA, which we don't know the length of yet. However, since EFGH is a square, HE is 5 units. So, if we go from H to E (length 5), then from E to A (unknown), and from A to D (length 5)? No, because D is connected to A via DA, which is part of the original square.

This is getting too abstract. Let me instead focus on calculating the total perimeter by adding up all the outer edges. Since the figure consists of multiple rectangles, but some sides are internal and thus not part of the perimeter.

Each large square has a perimeter of 4*5=20, but when connected, their shared sides are subtracted twice. However, with the added smaller rectangles, there might be more overlaps.

Alternatively, think of the entire figure as a larger polygon. For example, the outer perimeter might consist of the top and bottom sides of the large squares plus the extended sides.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Since all the inner lines are accounted for in the rectangles, maybe the total perimeter can be found by adding all the outer edges.

Looking back at the given lengths:

All the sides of the large rectangles are 5 units. The smaller segments (AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, etc.) are 2 units. However, when calculating the perimeter, we need to avoid counting internal lines.

For example, the line AB is part of the original square, but if it's also part of another rectangle, like ABGF, then AB is still an external edge unless it's covered by another rectangle. Wait, but AB is a side of both ABCD and ABGF. But ABGF is a rectangle, so AB is one side and FG is the opposite side. So, AB remains as an external edge, as FG is part of EFGH. Therefore, AB contributes to the perimeter.

However, some internal lines might be shared between rectangles. For instance, the line from F to B is length 2 and is part of the rectangle ABGF. But since F is connected to E (part of EFGH), maybe that line is internal. Wait, no—each rectangle's sides contribute to the perimeter unless they're completely enclosed within another rectangle.

This is getting too confusing. Perhaps I need to count all the unique edges that form the outline of the entire figure.

Another idea: The entire figure is made up of two large squares connected by smaller rectangles, resulting in a larger shape. The perimeter would then be the sum of the outer sides.

Let me assume that the figure is a larger rectangle. For example, if the two squares are placed side by side with extensions, the total length and width would be adjusted accordingly.

But given the complexity, maybe I should use the fact that all the sides of the large squares are 5, and the added segments are 2. For example, each side of the large square has a protrusion of 2 units. But how many times does this happen?

Alternatively, notice that the total number of unit lengths contributing to the perimeter. Each large square has 4 sides of 5, but when connected, some sides are merged. However, with the smaller rectangles, each connection adds new sides.

Wait, here's a different approach. Since all the given rectangles' sides are either 5 or 2, and the figure is constructed from these, maybe the perimeter is the sum of all the outer edges, which would involve some combination of these lengths.

But I need to find how many 5-length sides and 2-length sides are on the perimeter.

Let me try to count the number of each type:

Original large squares (ABCD and EFGH) have 4 sides each of 5. But when connected, some of these sides become internal. For example, the side AB of ABCD is connected to the rectangle ABGF, which might share that side. However, AB is still on the perimeter unless it's covered by another rectangle.

Alternatively, consider that the entire figure includes the outermost sides. For instance, the top side of the figure might be composed of parts of the upper rectangles.

Wait, here's a clue: The problem mentions multiple rectangles including Rectangle(D, C, E, A). This suggests that the points D, C, E, A form a rectangle. So, DC is connected to EA, and CE is connected to DA. Since DC is part of the original square ABCD (DC is length 5), then EA must also be length 5. So, the line from E to A is length 5. But earlier, I thought that AF was length 2 and FB was length 2, making AB=5. So, if EA is length 5, then that would suggest that E is positioned such that AE is a diagonal or something else?

No, wait, Rectangle(D, C, E, A) implies that DC and EA are opposite sides, hence equal in length. So, DC=EA=5. Therefore, the length of EA is 5. That means the line from E to A is length 5, which would be part of the perimeter if it's on the outside.

Now, putting this together, the entire figure's perimeter would include:

- The sides of the large squares that aren't shared with other rectangles.
- The sides of the smaller rectangles that are on the exterior.

Given the complexity, maybe the total perimeter is calculated as follows:

Each large square has 4 sides of 5, totaling 20 per square. Two squares would give 40, but they share some sides. However, due to the other rectangles, there are additional sides.

Wait, but there are also smaller rectangles like ABGF, which have sides of 2 and 5. Each of these smaller rectangles contributes to the perimeter. For example, the rectangle ABGF has sides AB=5, BF=2, FG=5, and GA=2. So, the perimeter contribution from this rectangle would be 5+2+5+2=14, but since AB and FG are already part of the larger squares, maybe they are internal?

This is getting too tangled. Let me think differently. Since the problem gives specific length equalities, maybe I can calculate the total perimeter by summing all the outer edges.

Looking at the lines provided:

There are several lines of length 5 and 2. Let's list them:

Lines of length 5:

- AB, BC, CD, DA (from rectangle ABCD)
- EF, FG, GH, HE (from rectangle EFGH)
- Also, DC (part of ABCD), EA (from rectangle DCEA), etc.

Lines of length 2:

- AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG (wait, HG is part of EFGH, which is length 5? No, HG is part of the rectangle EFGH, which is length 5. Wait, the given Equals(LengthOf(Line(H, G)), 2) is present? Wait, checking the predicates:

Yes, there's Equals(LengthOf(Line(H, G)), 2). Wait, but Line(H, G) is part of the rectangle EFGH. Earlier, it said Equals(LengthOf(Line(F, G)), 5), so FG is 5. But Line(H, G) is also 2? That contradicts unless there's a mistake. Wait, let me recheck the given predicates.

The user provided:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(D, H)), 2)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(H, G)), 2)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(G, C)), 2)"

So, Line(D, H) is 2, Line(H, G) is 2, and Line(G, C) is 2. But Line(G, C) is part of the rectangle DCGH? Or is it part of another rectangle?

Wait, Rectangle(D, C, E, A) has sides DC, CE, EA, AD. So, DC is 5, CE is part of the rectangle DCEA. Wait, but there's also a rectangle DCGH? Or maybe other rectangles. 

This indicates that there are multiple rectangles sharing sides, leading to some sides being counted multiple times. 

But regardless of that, the total perimeter would be the sum of all the outer edges. Let me attempt to count them.

Assume that the figure is a star-shaped or compound shape with multiple sides. However, without a diagram, this is challenging. Another approach: Since the problem provides specific lengths for all sides, perhaps we can sum all the given line lengths and divide by 2 (since each internal edge is counted twice).

Wait, that might work. Here's the idea: every line segment that is part of the boundary of the entire figure is counted once, while internal segments are counted twice (once for each adjacent rectangle). So, if we sum all the given line lengths and subtract the internal ones, we can get the perimeter.

But how to determine which lines are internal? It depends on how the rectangles are connected. For example, if two rectangles share a common side, that side is internal and should be subtracted once.

But this requires knowing which lines are shared. Given that there are multiple rectangles, let's list all the line segments and see which are shared.

List of all line segments with their lengths:

From the given predicates:

Lines of length 5:
- AB, BC, CD, DA (from ABCD)
- EF, FG, GH, HE (from EFGH)
- Also, DC (same as CD), EA (from DCEA), etc.

Wait, but EA is part of the rectangle DCEA, so EA is length 5. So, that adds another line of length 5.

Lines of length 2:
- AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG, etc.

Wait, let me list all the lines with their lengths:

1. Line(A,B): 5
2. Line(B,C): 5
3. Line(C,D): 5
4. Line(D,A): 5
5. Line(E,F): 5
6. Line(F,G): 5
7. Line(G,H): 5
8. Line(H,E): 5
9. Line(A,E): ?
10. Line(B,F): 2
11. Line(C,G): 2
12. Line(D,H): 2
13. Line(A,F): 2
14. Line(F,B): 2 (same as Line(B,F))
15. Line(B,G): 2
16. Line(C,G): 2 (already listed)
17. Line(D,H): 2 (already listed)
18. Line(H,G): 2
19. Line(G,C): 2 (same as Line(C,G))

Wait, some of these are duplicates. For example, Line(B,F) is the same as Line(F,B), and Line(C,G) is same as Line(G,C). So, the unique lines are:

Unique lines with their lengths:

- AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, FG, GH, HE: length 5 (total of 8 lines)
- AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG: length 2 (total of 6 lines)
- Also, Line(A,E): length ?

Wait, the line from A to E wasn't given a length explicitly. But since there's a rectangle DCEA, which has sides DC, CE, EA, AD. DC is length 5, so EA is also length 5. Hence, Line(A,E) is length 5.

So, adding that, we have one more line of length 5.

So, total lines:

Lines of length 5: AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, FG, GH, HE, EA → 9 lines of length 5.

Lines of length 2: AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG → 6 lines of length 2.

But wait, some of these lines might be internal. For example, AB is part of both ABCD and ABGF, but AB is still on the perimeter unless covered by another rectangle. Let me check which lines are internal.

Internal lines are those that are shared between two rectangles. For example, Line(AF) is part of rectangle ABGF and possibly another rectangle. Similarly, Line(FB) is part of ABGF and EFGH? Or not. Need to determine which lines are shared.

But this is getting too complex without seeing the actual figure. Let me take another approach: Calculate the total sum of all line lengths, then divide by 2 (since each internal edge is counted twice), and subtract that from the total to get the perimeter.

Total sum of all line lengths:

For length 5 lines: 9 lines × 5 = 45

For length 2 lines: 6 lines × 2 = 12

Total sum = 45 + 12 = 57

Now, each internal edge is counted twice, so the actual perimeter would be (Total sum - internal_edges)/2

But we need to find how many internal edges there are. Each time two rectangles share a side, that side is internal and counted twice in the total sum. So, the number of internal edges equals the number of shared sides between rectangles.

How many shared sides are there? Let's see:

- Rectangle ABCD shares side AB with rectangle ABGF.
- Rectangle ABGF shares side FG with rectangle EFGH (since FG is part of EFGH).
- Rectangle EFGH shares side HE with rectangle DCEA?
Not sure. Alternatively, each time two rectangles share a side, that's one internal edge.

But this is guesswork. Let's try to count the number of shared sides:

1. AB is shared between ABCD and ABGF → internal edge
2. BC is shared between ABCD and ...? BC is part of ABCD and maybe another rectangle? If there's a rectangle BCFG? Or not. Looking at the given rectangles, Rectangle(B,F,G,C) exists, which is BFCG. So, BC is shared between ABCD and BFCG → internal edge
3. CD is shared between ABCD and DCGH? Or another rectangle? If there's a rectangle DCHG, then CD is shared.
4. DA is shared between ABCD and DCEA → internal edge
5. EF is shared between EFGH and ...
6. FG is shared between EFGH and ABGF → internal edge
7. GH is shared between EFGH and DCHG? Or another rectangle?
8. HE is shared between EFGH and DCEA → internal edge
9. EA is shared between DCEA and ...? Maybe with another rectangle?
10. AF is shared between ABGF and ...?
11. FB is shared between ABGF and BFCG → internal edge
12. BG is shared between BFCG and ...?
13. GC is shared between BFCG and DCGH → internal edge
14. DH is shared between DCGH and ...?
15. HG is shared between DCGH and EFGH → internal edge
16. Other shared sides?

This is getting too many. Assuming there are 8 internal edges (each shared side counts once), then total internal edges = 8. Thus, the total perimeter would be (57 - 8)/2 = (49)/2 = 24.5, which rounds to 24.5. But the answer choices are A.20, B.21, C.24, D.25. So, 24.5 would round to 24.5, but since it's not an option, maybe my assumption about internal edges is wrong.

Alternatively, if there are 9 internal edges, then perimeter would be (57 - 9)/2 = 48/2 = 24, which is option C. That seems plausible.

But how many internal edges are there? Let's try again:

Each rectangle has 4 sides, but they share sides with other rectangles. Let's count the number of shared sides:

- ABCD shares AB with ABGF → 1
- ABCD shares BC with BFCG → 1
- ABCD shares CD with DCGH → 1
- ABCD shares DA with DCEA → 1
- EFGH shares EF with ABGF → 1
- EFGH shares FG with ABGF → 1
- EFGH shares GH with DCGH → 1
- EFGH shares HE with DCEA → 1
- ABGF shares AF with ...? Maybe with another rectangle?
- BFCG shares BG with ...?
- DCGH shares GC with ...?
- DCEA shares EA with ...?

Wait, maybe there are 8 shared sides. So, 8 internal edges. Then total perimeter would be (57 - 8)/2 = 49/2 = 24.5 → rounds to 24.5, which is not an option. But option C is 24. Maybe the actual number of internal edges is 9, giving 24.

Alternatively, maybe my initial calculation of total line lengths is incorrect. Let me recount the number of lines.

Earlier, I assumed there are 9 lines of length 5 and 6 of length 2. But let me verify:

Lines of length 5:

- AB, BC, CD, DA (from ABCD) → 4 lines
- EF, FG, GH, HE (from EFGH) → 4 lines
- EA (from DCEA) → 1 line
Total: 4+4+1=9 lines of 5 → 9×5=45

Lines of length 2:

- AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG → 6 lines
Total: 6×2=12

Total sum: 45+12=57

If there are 9 internal edges, then perimeter is (57-9)/2 = 48/2=24. So, answer C.

But why 9 internal edges? Let's think:

Each shared side is counted twice in the total sum. Each internal edge is shared between two rectangles, so each contributes twice to the total sum. The perimeter is the sum of all edges minus twice the internal edges (since each internal edge is counted twice in the total sum, so to get the perimeter, we subtract the internal edges once).

Wait, the formula is:

Total perimeter = (sum of all line lengths) - 2*(number of internal edges)

Because each internal edge is counted twice in the total sum, and we want to count it zero times in the perimeter. So:

Perimeter = Total_sum - 2 * internal_edges.

But I'm not sure. Let me clarify.

Suppose each internal edge is part of two rectangles, so it appears twice in the total_sum. To get the perimeter, we need to exclude these internal edges entirely. So, if we have total_sum = perimeter + 2 * internal_edges. Therefore, perimeter = total_sum - 2 * internal_edges.

In our case, if we assume that there are 9 internal edges, then perimeter = 57 - 2*9 = 57 - 18 = 39. But that doesn't align with previous thoughts. So this approach might be incorrect.

Alternative approach: Each internal edge is shared by two rectangles, so it's counted twice in the total_sum. The perimeter consists of all edges that are on the boundary of the entire figure. So, the total_sum counts each boundary edge once and each internal edge twice. Therefore, perimeter = total_sum - internal_edges.

Because:

total_sum = perimeter + 2 * internal_edges

Thus, perimeter = total_sum - internal_edges.

So, if we can find the number of internal edges, we can compute the perimeter.

Now, how many internal edges are there? Let's count the number of shared sides between rectangles.

Looking at the given rectangles:

1. Rectangle(A,B,C,D) shares AB with ABGF.
2. Shares BC with BFCG.
3. Shares CD with DCGH.
4. Shares DA with DCEA.
5. Rectangle(E,F,G,H) shares EF with ABGF.
6. Shares FG with ABGF.
7. Shares GH with DCGH.
8. Shares HE with DCEA.
9. Rectangle(A,B,G,F) shares AF with ABGF and BG with BFCG.
Wait, no. Each rectangle has its own sides. For example, ABGF has sides AB, BF, FG, GA. So, AB is shared with ABCD, BF is shared with BFCG, FG is shared with EFGH, and GA is shared with DCEA? Or not.

This is very complex. But assuming there are 8 shared sides (each rectangle shares 4 sides with others), but some are counted multiple times. 

Alternatively, if there are 8 internal edges, then perimeter = 57 - 8 = 49. But 49 is not an option. If there are 9 internal edges, then 57-9=48, which is not an option either. 

This suggests my method is flawed. Let me try a different approach. 

Since the problem states that there are multiple rectangles, and the perimeter likely involves adding up the outer edges. Let me consider that each large square has a perimeter of 20, but some sides are overlapped. 

But with the smaller rectangles, each side of the large squares might be split. For example, AB is length 5, but there's a line from A to F (length 2) and from B to F (length 2), which suggests that AB is divided into AF + FB = 4, but AB is supposed to be 5. This inconsistency indicates that my earlier understanding is wrong. 

Ah! Wait, this is critical. If AF is 2 and FB is 2, then AB should be AF + FB = 4, but the given length of AB is 5. This contradiction implies that AF and FB are not collinear with AB. So, AF and FB are not along the same line as AB, but rather form a rectangle ABGF, where AF and BG are perpendicular to AB. 

This changes everything. So, AB is a side of the rectangle ABCD, length 5. Point F is not on AB, but instead, AF and BF are sides of the rectangle ABGF, which is perpendicular to AB. So, AF and BF are perpendicular to AB, forming a right angle at F. 

This means that AF and BF are perpendicular to AB, so they form a sort of T-shape, with AB as the base and AF/BF as the vertical sides. In this case, the length of AB is still 5, and AF and BF are 2 each, forming a rectangle ABGF with sides 5 and 2. 

This configuration implies that the entire figure is more complex, with multiple rectangles extending from the large squares. 

Now, to calculate the perimeter, we need to consider all the outer edges. Let's try to visualize the figure:

- Start with square ABCD (side 5).
- From point A, draw a vertical line AF of length 2 upwards.
- From point B, draw a vertical line BF of length 2 upwards.
- Connect F to G, which is part of the square EFGH.
- Similarly, from point C, draw CG of length 2 upwards.
- From point D, draw DH of length 2 upwards.
- These vertical lines (AF, BF, CG, DH) are each 2 units, and they connect to points F, G, etc., which form the square EFGH.

Assuming that EFGH is a square of side 5, connected to these vertical lines. So, for example, point F is connected to E, which is part of the square EFGH. The line FE is length 5, and since F is 2 units above B, the position of E would depend on the alignment.

But this is still unclear. However, the key insight is that each of the vertical lines (AF, BF, CG, DH) are 2 units, and they connect to the square EFGH, which has sides of length 5. 

Now, the perimeter would include:

- The top and bottom of the large squares, plus the vertical extensions.

But since the vertical extensions are 2 units, and there are four of them (AF, BF, CG, DH), each contributing to the perimeter.

But how many times are these vertical lines included in the perimeter?

For example, AF is part of the rectangle ABGF, which is attached to the square ABCD. If the rectangle ABGF is outside the square ABCD, then AF and BF would be part of the perimeter. Similarly, CG and DH are part of the perimeter.

Meanwhile, the square EFGH would have its own perimeter, but parts of it might overlap with other rectangles.

Alternatively, the entire figure could be a larger rectangle with dimensions (5 + 2) by (5 + 2), but that would give a perimeter of 2*(5+2)*2 = 28, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, considering the vertical extensions: each side of the large square has a 2-unit extension. For example, the top side of ABCD would have a 2-unit extension from D and C, and similarly for other sides. But this is speculative.

Another idea: The total perimeter is the sum of all outer sides. Each large square contributes 4*5=20, but we have to adjust for overlaps. With the additions of the 2-unit sides, maybe it's 20 (for ABCD) + 20 (for EFGH) + 4*2 (for the vertical extensions) - 2*5 (for the overlapping sides). But this is guesswork.

Alternatively, since there are four 2-unit sides (AF, BF, CG, DH) and the rest of the perimeter comes from the large squares. But this is not precise.

Wait, let's think about the total perimeter contributions:

- The original square ABCD has perimeter 20, but parts of its sides are replaced by the 2-unit extensions. For example, the side AB is replaced by AF and BF, but those are part of the perimeter. Wait, no. If AB is part of the large square, and AF and BF are extensions, then AB is still part of the perimeter. 

This is really confusing without a visual. Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll proceed with the earlier calculation where the total_sum is 57, and if there are 9 internal edges, the perimeter is 57 - 9 = 48, which is not an option. But if I assume that there are 8 internal edges, the perimeter would be 57 - 8 = 49, which is also not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the total_sum is different. Let me recalculate the number of lines.

Wait, the line EA is part of the rectangle DCEA, so it's a side of length 5. Are there any other lines of length 5? Let me list all lines again:

From the given predicates, the lines are:

- Line(A,B): 5
- Line(B,C): 5
- Line(C,D): 5
- Line(D,A): 5
- Line(E,F): 5
- Line(F,G): 5
- Line(G,H): 5
- Line(H,E): 5
- Line(A,E): 5 (from rectangle DCEA)
- Line(A,F): 2
- Line(B,F): 2
- Line(C,G): 2
- Line(D,H): 2
- Line(H,G): 2
- Line(G,C): 2 (same as Line(C,G))
- Line(F,B): 2 (same as Line(B,F))
- Line(A,F): 2 (same as before)

So, unique lines of length 5: AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, FG, GH, HE, EA → 9 lines.

Unique lines of length 2: AF, FB, BG, GC, DH, HG → 6 lines.

Total sum: 9*5 + 6*2 = 45 + 12 = 57.

Now, if each internal edge is counted twice, and assuming there are 8 internal edges (each shared side), then the perimeter would be 57 - 2*8 = 57 - 16 = 41, which is not an option. Still no luck.

Maybe I should think about the perimeter as follows: Each large square contributes 4*5 = 20, but the smaller rectangles add extra. For example, the rectangle ABGF has perimeter 2*(5+2)=14, but it's partially overlapping with the large square. 

But this approach is not yielding results quickly. Given the time I've invested and the need to choose an answer, I'll consider that the perimeter is 24, which is option C. This is because, in the earlier calculation, if there are 9 internal edges, the perimeter would be 57 - 9 = 48, which is not matching, but if I assume that some of the 2-unit lines are internal, and the total perimeter is 24, which is close to the options.

Alternatively, if the figure is made up of two squares of 5x5, with each having a 2x5 rectangle attached, the total perimeter would be 20 + 20 + 2*2*2 = 40 + 8 = 48, but again not matching.

Wait, another idea: The perimeter consists of the outer sides of the large squares plus the 2-unit extensions. For example, each large square has 4 sides of 5, but two of those sides are replaced by 2-unit extensions. So, for each square, the contribution is 2*5 + 2*2 = 14. Two squares would give 28. But there are four 2-unit extensions, so 4*2 = 8. Total perimeter would be 28 + 8 = 36, which is still not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, and the fact that the total_sum is 57, and if there are 15 internal edges, then perimeter is 57 - 15 = 42. Still not matching.

Wait, let me think about the fact that each of the 2-unit lines is part of the perimeter. There are 6 lines of length 2, so 12 units. The 9 lines of length 5 contribute 45, but some of these are internal. Assume that 3 of the 5-length lines are internal, so 45 - 3*5 = 30. Total perimeter would be 30 + 12 = 42. Still not matching.

At this point, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the options are 20, 21, 24, 25, and the most likely answer is 24, which is option C. I'll go with that.
