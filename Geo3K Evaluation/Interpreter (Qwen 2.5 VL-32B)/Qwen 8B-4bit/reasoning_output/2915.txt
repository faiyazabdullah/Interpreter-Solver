Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a circle O with several points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. The problem says that EC and AB are diameters. Also, there are some angle congruences mentioned: angle BOD is congruent to angle DOE, which is congruent to angle EOF, and angle FOA. Plus, there's a right angle at angle FOB. We need to find the measure of arc AD.

First, I should recall that in a circle, the measure of an arc is related to the central angle that subtends it. Since all the points are on the circle, and O is the center, any line from O to a point on the circle is a radius. Also, diameters are straight lines passing through the center, so their length is twice the radius.

Given that EC and AB are diameters, points E and C are endpoints of one diameter, and A and B are endpoints of another. Since they're diameters, each of these lines passes through the center O. That means OA, OB, OC, OE, OF are all radii. Wait, but the problem also mentions points D and F? Let me check again.

Wait, the points listed are A, B, C, D, E, F. All lie on the circle. The diameters are EC and AB. So EC connects E and C, which are two points on the circle, making EC a diameter. Similarly, AB is a diameter connecting A and B.

Now, looking at the angles: angle BOD ≅ angle DOE ≅ angle EOF ≅ angle FOA. Each of these angles has vertex at O, so they are central angles. Therefore, each of these angles corresponds to arcs BD, DE, EF, and FA respectively. Since they are congruent, those arcs must be equal in measure. 

Also, since angle FOB is a right angle, which would mean that angle FOB is 90 degrees. But angle FOB is formed by points F, O, B. Since O is the center, OF and OB are radii. So angle FOB being a right angle implies that the arc FB is 90 degrees because the central angle equals the arc measure.

Let me start by considering the total circumference of the circle. The sum of all arcs around the circle should be 360 degrees. The angles given are four congruent angles: BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. Let me denote each of these angles as x degrees. Then, angle BOD = x, angle DOE = x, angle EOF = x, angle FOA = x. 

But wait, angle FOA is part of the circle. However, there's also the right angle at FOB. Let me think about how these angles relate. Let me visualize the circle with center O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F are placed such that AB and EC are diameters. Let me sketch mentally:

AB is a diameter, so points A and B are opposite each other. Similarly, E and C are endpoints of another diameter. Now, the angles mentioned involve points D, E, F. The angles at O are BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. These angles seem to connect points moving from B to D to E to F to A. So starting from B, going through D, then E, then F, then back to A. 

Each of these angles (BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA) are congruent. Also, angle FOB is a right angle. Let me note that angle FOB is formed by points F, O, B. Since OF and OB are radii, and angle FOB is 90 degrees, that tells us that arc FB is 90 degrees. 

Now, let me consider the entire circle. The total degrees around point O add up to 360. So if we can express all arcs in terms of x, maybe?

Let me list the arcs corresponding to each angle:

- Arc BD corresponds to angle BOD (x degrees)
- Arc DE corresponds to angle DOE (x degrees)
- Arc EF corresponds to angle EOF (x degrees)
- Arc FA corresponds to angle FOA (x degrees)

Additionally, there's the arc FB which is 90 degrees. Wait, but where does arc FB fit into this?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the entire arrangement. Starting from point B, moving through D, E, F, A, and then back to B. But there might be overlapping arcs or missing parts.

Wait, let's see. If we look at the angles:

Starting from point B, angle BOD is between points B, O, D. So that suggests that D is somewhere on the circle such that when connected to O, it forms an angle with B. Similarly, angle DOE is between D, O, E; so E is next. Then angle EOF is between E, O, F; then angle FOA is between F, O, A.

So, the points are arranged in order B -> D -> E -> F -> A around the circle. But since AB is a diameter, point A is directly opposite B. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E is opposite C. 

But how do these points relate? Let me try to map them.

Since AB is a diameter, points A and B are endpoints. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E and C are endpoints. Also, angle FOB is 90 degrees. Let me think about where point F is located.

Since angle FOB is 90 degrees, and O is the center, then points F and B are separated by a quarter-circle. Because the central angle between them is 90 degrees, so arc FB is 90 degrees. 

Now, the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are all congruent. Let me call each of these angles x. So angle BOD = x, angle DOE = x, angle EOF = x, angle FOA = x. So adding these up, we get 4x degrees. But there's also the angle FOB, which is 90 degrees. How does that fit in?

Wait, maybe the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA cover certain arcs, but there might be overlaps or other arcs. Alternatively, perhaps these angles are adjacent and together form parts of the circle.

Let me think of the full circle. Starting from point B, going through D, E, F, A, and then back to B. The arcs between these points would be BD, DE, EF, FA. Additionally, there's the arc from A back to B, which would be AB, but AB is a diameter, so that arc is 180 degrees. Wait, but AB is a diameter, so the arc AB is 180 degrees. However, according to our earlier breakdown, the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x degrees, totaling 4x. But then the remaining arc from A to B would be arc AB minus the arc FA and arc something? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some arcs. Let me try to imagine the circle with points B, D, E, F, A. The arcs between these points are BD, DE, EF, FA. But also, there's the arc from A to B, which is the diameter AB. But if we go from A to B along the circle, that could be either the minor arc or major arc. Since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. However, depending on the position of the points, maybe the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA plus arc AB make up the whole circle?

Wait, if we traverse from B to D to E to F to A, then back to B. So the arcs BD + DE + EF + FA would make up the entire circle except for the arc from A to B. Wait, but that arc from A to B is AB, which is a diameter, hence 180 degrees. So the total of BD + DE + EF + FA = 360 - 180 = 180 degrees. But each of those arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is x, so 4x = 180 => x = 45 degrees. 

But then, angle FOB is 90 degrees. How does that fit in?

Wait, angle FOB is formed by points F, O, B. So that's the central angle between F and B. Which would correspond to arc FB. Earlier, we thought arc FB was 90 degrees. But according to the previous calculation, if each of the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is 45 degrees, then let's see where F is located.

Starting from B, moving through D (arc BD = 45°), then DE = 45°, then EF = 45°, then FA = 45°, so from B to A via D, E, F is 4*45=180°, which makes sense since AB is a diameter. So the arc BA is 180°, which matches.

But where is point F located? From point E, moving 45° to F. Then from F to A is another 45°, so arc FA is 45°, which would place F such that from E to F is 45°, and F to A is 45°, making arc EA = arc EF + arc FA = 45+45=90°, so arc EA is 90°, meaning that angle EOA is 90°, but wait, O is the center, so angle EOA is a central angle. Wait, but E and A are points on the circle. 

But there's also the angle FOB being 90°, which is the angle between F and B. So if arc FB is 90°, then that would imply that the central angle FOB is 90°, which matches. So how does arc FB relate to the other arcs?

Let me think. From point F to B, that's arc FB. But according to the previous setup, the points are arranged as B → D → E → F → A. So from F to B, that would pass through the rest of the circle. Wait, but if we go from F to B, it depends on direction. Since we went from B to D to E to F to A, then the arc from F to B could be the short way or long way around the circle. But since angle FOB is 90°, that suggests that arc FB is 90°, which is the smaller arc.

So, if arc FB is 90°, then how does that fit into the existing arcs? Let's try to calculate the position of point F.

We know that from B to D is 45°, D to E is 45°, E to F is 45°, F to A is 45°, so from B to A is 180°, which is correct. Now, arc from F to B would depend on the direction. If we go from F to B along the shorter arc, it's 90°, which would mean that the arc from F to B is 90°, implying that point F is positioned such that from F to B is 90°. 

But let's check. If we start at point B, move 45° to D, then 45° to E, then 45° to F, then 45° to A. So from point F, moving clockwise, the next point is A. To get from F to B, going counterclockwise, it would pass through A, then... Well, since AB is a diameter, moving from A to B is 180°, but that's the same as going the other way. Wait, maybe I need to draw coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me assume the circle has radius r, and place point O at the origin. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity.

Let’s suppose that point B is at (r, 0). Since AB is a diameter, point A would be at (-r, 0). Now, EC is another diameter. Let me consider point E and point C. But since we don't have info on EC yet, maybe I need to find relations based on angles.

From earlier, we found that each of the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA is 45°, leading to arc measures of 45° each. So if we can find the position of point D, E, F, etc., relative to B and A.

Starting from point B at (r, 0), angle BOD is 45°, so point D is 45° counterclockwise from B. Wait, but direction matters. Depending on the orientation. Assuming standard position, angles are measured counterclockwise.

So if we take the angle BOD as 45°, then point D is 45° counterclockwise from B. Since B is at (r, 0), moving 45° counterclockwise would put D at an angle of 45° from the positive x-axis. So coordinates of D would be (r cos 45°, r sin 45°).

Then, angle DOE is 45°, so from D to E is another 45°, so point E is 45° further counterclockwise. So E would be at 45° + 45° = 90°, which is straight up on the y-axis. Coordinates of E would be (0, r).

Then angle EOF is 45°, so from E to F is another 45°, placing F at 90° + 45° = 135°. Coordinates of F: (r cos 135°, r sin 135°).

Then angle FOA is 45°, so from F to A is another 45°, which would bring us to 135° + 45° = 180°, which is point A at (-r, 0), matching our initial placement of A. So that checks out.

Now, with this setup, point F is at 135°, and point B is at 0°. The arc from F to B would be the difference in angles. Since F is at 135°, and B is at 0°, the arc from F to B going counterclockwise is 360° - 135° = 225°, but the shorter arc is the minimum of 225° and 135°, which is 135°. Wait, but earlier we were told that angle FOB is a right angle (90°), which would imply that the arc FB is 90°, but here it seems like arc FB is 135°, which contradicts. What's wrong here?

Ah! There's a mistake here. Because angle FOB is the central angle between points F and B, which is the angle between vectors OF and OB. In our coordinate system, point F is at 135°, and point B is at 0°, so the central angle between them is |135° - 0°| = 135°, but the actual angle is the smallest angle between them. Wait, but the angle FOB is given as a right angle (90°), which suggests that the central angle is 90°, not 135°. So there's a contradiction here. Where did I go wrong?

Earlier, I assumed that the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are each 45°, which added up to 180°, leaving the rest of the circle as arc AB (diameter) which is 180°. But that didn't account for the angle FOB being 90°. So my assumption that each of those angles is 45° may be incorrect.

Let me re-examine. The problem states that angle BOD ≅ angle DOE ≅ angle EOF ≅ angle FOA. Let me denote each as x. Additionally, angle FOB is 90°. How do these angles relate?

Let me consider that angle FOB is formed by points F, O, B. This angle is made by the lines OF and OB. So, the measure of angle FOB is equal to the measure of arc FB. Since it's a central angle, yes. So arc FB is 90°, as given.

Now, the total of all arcs around the circle is 360°. Let me try to express the arcs in terms of x and the known arc FB.

Looking at the angles given:

- Arc BD corresponds to angle BOD = x
- Arc DE corresponds to angle DOE = x
- Arc EF corresponds to angle EOF = x
- Arc FA corresponds to angle FOA = x

So, arcs BD + DE + EF + FA = 4x. 

Additionally, arc FB is 90°, as per angle FOB. But arc FB can be expressed in terms of other arcs. For example, arc FB is composed of arc FD + arc DE + arc EB? Or depends on the path. Alternatively, since we have points arranged as B -> D -> E -> F -> A, the arc from F to B could be going through A and then to B, which would be arc FA + arc AB - arc ... Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

If we have points B, D, E, F, A arranged around the circle, then the arc from F to B can be broken down as follows: from F to A is arc FA (which is x), then from A to B is arc AB (which is 180°, since AB is a diameter). So arc FB would be arc FA + arc AB = x + 180°, but that doesn't make sense because arc FB is supposed to be 90°. Wait, that can't be. So there's inconsistency here.

Alternatively, maybe arc FB is the other way around, going through D, E. For instance, from F to B going through D and E. So arc FD + arc DE + arc EB. But arc FD would be arc from F to D. Wait, but I don't know arc FD. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, since the total of arcs BD + DE + EF + FA = 4x, and arc AB is 180°, which is from A to B. But arc AB can also be considered as arc AF + arc FB. Wait, arc AF is x (from angle FOA), and arc FB is 90°, so arc AB = x + 90°. But since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180°, so x + 90° = 180°, leading to x = 90°. But that would make each of those angles x = 90°, which would make 4x = 360°, but then arc AB would be 180°, but that conflicts with arc AB being x + 90° = 180°, which gives x = 90°. However, if each of the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA is 90°, then the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA would each be 90°, totaling 360°, but that would mean the entire circle is covered by these arcs, which isn't possible since arc AB is already 180°. This suggests that my previous assumption is wrong.

Hmm, this indicates that my earlier approach is flawed. Let me try again.

Perhaps I need to consider that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are not all separate from arc AB. Maybe some overlap or other relationships.

Let me consider that the total circle is divided into arcs by points A, B, C, D, E, F. Given that AB and EC are diameters, so points A and B are opposites, E and C are opposites. Also, angle FOB is 90°, so arc FB is 90°.

Let me try to express all arcs in terms of variables.

Let me define:

Arc AB is 180° (since AB is a diameter).

Arc BC is ?

Arc CD is ?

Arc DE is ?

Arc EF is ?

Arc FA is ?

Wait, but this might not be helpful without more info.

Alternatively, since we have points D, E, F involved, maybe focusing on the arcs involving these points.

From the given angles:

- Angle BOD = x ⇒ arc BD = x
- Angle DOE = x ⇒ arc DE = x
- Angle EOF = x ⇒ arc EF = x
- Angle FOA = x ⇒ arc FA = x

So these four arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x. Thus, total of these arcs is 4x. 

Additionally, arc AB is 180°, which is from A to B. But arc AB can also be thought of as arc AF + arc FB. Arc AF is x (from angle FOA), and arc FB is 90° (given). So arc AB = x + 90° = 180° ⇒ x = 90°. 

If x = 90°, then each of the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is 90°, totaling 4*90=360°, which would mean that the entire circle is covered by these arcs. But that would imply that points A, F, E, D, B are all spaced every 90°, forming a square-like structure. 

But then, arc AB is 180°, which would require that arc AF + arc FB = 90° + 90° = 180°, which fits. 

However, there's also the diameter EC. Point E and C are endpoints of a diameter, so arc EC is 180°. Let's see where point C is. 

Since point E is part of the arc from D to F. If arc DE is x = 90°, and arc EF is x = 90°, then point E is 90° away from D and 90° away from F. 

Assuming the points are ordered B, D, E, F, A around the circle. With arc BD = 90°, arc DE = 90°, arc EF = 90°, arc FA = 90°, then total from B to A is 90+90+90+90=360°, which would mean that point A coincides with point B, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be right. 

This suggests a contradiction, indicating that my assumption is still wrong. What's the error here?

Let me backtrack. If arc AB is 180°, and arc AF is x, arc FB is 90°, then x + 90° = 180° ⇒ x = 90°. So arc AF = 90°, arc FB = 90°, arc AB = 180°. But then, the arc from A to B via F is 90° + 90° = 180°, which works. 

But then, the other arcs BD, DE, EF would be x = 90° each. So starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, another 90° to F, and finally 90° to A. So from B to A, that's four arcs of 90°, totaling 360°, which would mean that point A is back to where it started? No, that would imply that after four 90° arcs from B, we return to B, but we're going to A. So this is conflicting.

Ah! Here's the mistake: arc BD is 90°, arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°, and arc FA is 90°, totaling 360°, which would mean that starting from B, moving through D, E, F, and ending at A, which would make arc BA equal to 360°, but BA is a diameter, so it should be 180°. Contradiction again. 

Therefore, my assumption that arc AB = arc AF + arc FB is incorrect. Why? Because arc AF is part of the path from A to B, but depending on the direction. Perhaps arc AF is not the same as the arc from A to F. Wait, in this case, arc FA is 90°, which is the arc from F to A, so arc AF would be the same as arc FA, just traversed in reverse. So arc AF is also 90°. 

But then, the arc from B to A through D, E, F is 90° (BD) + 90° (DE) + 90° (EF) + 90° (FA) = 360°, which loops around the entire circle, bringing us back to B. But we wanted to get from B to A, which should be 180°. Hence, this suggests that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are actually part of a larger circle, and there's another arc AB that is the diameter. 

This confusion arises because the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are not the only ones. There's also the arc from A to B directly, which is the diameter. So the total of all arcs around the circle should be 360°, including arc AB.

Wait, but arc AB is 180°, and the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are 4x. But how do these relate? It seems that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are overlapping with arc AB?

Maybe I need to consider that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are parts of the circle, and arc AB is another part. Let me try to visualize the circle with points A, B, D, E, F.

Starting from point B, moving through D (arc BD = x), then to E (arc DE = x), then to F (arc EF = x), then to A (arc FA = x). So from B to A, that's 4x. But since AB is a diameter, that arc should be 180°, so 4x = 180° ⇒ x = 45°. 

So each of the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is 45°, totaling 180°, which matches the diameter AB. 

Then, what about arc FB? Arc FB would be the arc from F to B. Since we've gone from B to D to E to F to A, then from F to B would be the arc that goes from F through A to B, which is arc FA (45°) + arc AB (180°)? No, that would be 45° + 180° = 225°, which is too large. Alternatively, the shorter arc from F to B would be the arc going through D, E. 

Let me compute the arc from F to B. Since we have arc FA = 45°, arc AB = 180°, but arc FB is the arc from F to B, which would be the same as arc FB going the other way around. Let me think about the positions:

If arc BD = 45°, DE = 45°, EF = 45°, FA = 45°, then from B to D is 45°, D to E is another 45°, E to F is another 45°, F to A is another 45°. So from B to A is 4*45 = 180°, which is correct. Now, to find arc FB, we can go from F to B. If we go from F to A is 45°, then from A to B is 180°, so total arc FB going through A is 45° + 180° = 225°, but the shorter arc is the other way around, which would be the arc from F to B going through D, E. Let's compute that.

From F to E is 45°, E to D is 45°, D to B is 45°, so total arc from F to B through D and E is 45 + 45 + 45 = 135°. So arc FB is 135°, but the problem states that angle FOB is a right angle (90°), which implies that arc FB is 90°. This is a contradiction again. 

What's the issue here? It seems that assuming the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x leads to arc FB being 135°, but the problem says it's 90°. So where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the arc FB is not going through D, E, but directly. But how? Let me think again. 

If angle FOB is 90°, then arc FB must be 90°, so there's another constraint. Let me use this to set up equations.

We have from before:

Arc BD = x

Arc DE = x

Arc EF = x

Arc FA = x

Total from B to A is 4x = 180° ⇒ x = 45°

But then, arc FB is the arc from F to B. As computed earlier, this arc is 135°, which contradicts the given 90°. 

So there's an inconsistency. This suggests that my initial assumption that the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x is incorrect. But why?

Because the angle FOB is given as 90°, which relates to arc FB. So perhaps arc FB is not accounted for in the above arcs. Let me try to model this properly.

Let me consider all arcs in the circle:

Let me define the arcs between consecutive points. Assume the points are arranged in the order B, D, E, F, A, and then back to B. But there are other points like C, which is the endpoint of diameter EC. 

Wait, EC is a diameter, so points E and C are endpoints. So if E is one end of the diameter, then C is the other end. So if E is at a certain position, C is directly opposite. 

But in our previous setup, point E was at 90°, so point C would be at 90° + 180° = 270°. 

But how does this affect the arc FB? Let me try to integrate this.

If arc FB is 90°, then the arc from F to B is 90°. Let me assume that arc FB is 90°, so the central angle FOB is 90°. 

Now, from earlier, we had 4x = 180°, giving x = 45°, but that led to arc FB being 135°, which is inconsistent. So perhaps there's another relationship.

Let me try to write equations based on the total circle.

Total circumference is 360°. Let me express all arcs in terms of x and other known arcs.

We have:

Arc BD = x

Arc DE = x

Arc EF = x

Arc FA = x

Arc AB = 180°

But arc AB is also equal to arc AF + arc FB. Arc AF is x, arc FB is 90°, so:

arc AB = x + 90° = 180° ⇒ x = 90°

But then, arc BD = x = 90°, arc DE = 90°, arc EF = 90°, arc FA = 90°, totaling 360°, which would mean that starting from B, going through D, E, F, and back to A, covers the entire circle. But arc AB is 180°, which would mean that from B to A is 180°, but according to this, it's 360°, which is impossible. So this suggests that arc AB is not the same as arc AF + arc FB, but rather, arc AB is the direct arc, while arc AF + arc FB is another path.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps I should use the fact that angle FOB is 90°, and relate it to the other arcs.

Let me consider that arc FB is 90°, and arc FA is x. So from F to A is x, and from A to B is arc AB = 180°, so the arc from F to B through A is x + 180°. But since arc FB is 90°, this must be the shorter arc, so x + 180° = 90° + 360°k, where k is an integer. But since x is positive and less than 360°, the only possibility is x + 180° = 90° + 360°k. Solving for x:

x = 90° + 360°k - 180° = -90° + 360°k. Since x must be positive, let's take k=1: x = 270°, which is too large. k=0: x = -90°, invalid. So this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Since arc FB is 90°, and arc FA is x, then the arc from F to B can also be expressed as arc FB = arc FE + arc ED + arc DB. Wait, arc FE is x (from E to F is x?), no, arc FE would be the same as arc EF, which is x. Wait, arc EF is x, so arc FE is x. Then arc ED is arc DE = x, arc DB is arc BD = x. So total arc FB = x + x + x = 3x. But arc FB is 90°, so 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°. 

Let me check this. If arc FB = 3x = 90°, then x = 30°. 

So, arc BD = x = 30°, arc DE = 30°, arc EF = 30°, arc FA = 30°. Total of these arcs: 30*4 = 120°. 

Now, what about arc AB? It is 180°, which can be expressed as arc AF + arc FB? No, because arc AF is 30°, and arc FB is 90°, which would give 30 + 90 = 120°, but arc AB is 180°. So this doesn't add up. 

Alternatively, arc AB could be arc AF + arc FE + arc ED + arc DB. Let me see: arc AF = 30°, arc FE = 30°, arc ED = 30°, arc DB = 30°. Total: 30*4 = 120°, still not 180°. 

So this suggests that there's more to the circle. Let me think: the total circle is 360°, and we have arc BD + DE + EF + FA = 4x = 120°, and arc FB = 90°, so total so far is 120 + 90 = 210°, leaving 150° unaccounted for. This suggests that there are other arcs, like arc BC, arc CD, etc., but since EC is a diameter, point C is opposite E. 

Let me try to incorporate point C. Since EC is a diameter, point C is directly opposite E. If point E is at some position, then point C is 180° away. 

But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. Let me try to use the previous x = 30°. 

If arc BD = 30°, arc DE = 30°, arc EF = 30°, arc FA = 30°, total 120°. Arc FB is 90°, so total so far is 120 + 90 = 210°. Remaining is 150°, which must be other arcs. 

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I should focus on the given angles and arcs.

Another idea: since AB and EC are diameters, points A and B are opposites, and E and C are opposites. So, if I can find the position of D and F, I can find arc AD.

Let me try to use the angles given. The angles at O are BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA, each congruent. Let's call each of these angles x. Also, angle FOB is 90°.

Let me consider the sum of all central angles around point O. The total should be 360°. 

The central angles around O are:

- Angle BOD = x
- Angle DOE = x
- Angle EOF = x
- Angle FOA = x
- And also, the angle between A and B, which is angle AOB. But since AB is a diameter, angle AOB is 180°. 

Wait, but if we add up all the angles around point O, they should sum to 360°. Let me see: from point B, going through D, E, F, A, and back to B. So the angles at O are:

- Between B and D: x
- Between D and E: x
- Between E and F: x
- Between F and A: x
- Between A and B: ? 

But angle AOB is 180°, which is the angle between A and B. So the sum of the angles x + x + x + x + 180° = 4x + 180° = 360° ⇒ 4x = 180° ⇒ x = 45°. 

This matches our earlier conclusion that x = 45°. So each of the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA is 45°, and angle AOB is 180°. 

Now, with x = 45°, let's revisit the arc FB. 

From earlier, we said that arc FB is 90°, which is given. Let's verify this with x = 45°. 

How is arc FB determined? Let's consider the positions of F and B. 

Starting from point B, moving through D (45°), E (another 45°), F (another 45°), then to A (another 45°). So from B to A is 4*45° = 180°, which is correct. 

Now, to find arc FB, let's consider the path from F to B. Since from F to A is 45°, and from A to B is 180°, the total arc from F to B through A is 45° + 180° = 225°. But the shorter arc from F to B would be the other way around, which is 360° - 225° = 135°. But this contradicts the given that angle FOB is 90°, which implies arc FB is 90°. 

This suggests that there's an error in the assumption that arc FB is 135°, but it should be 90°. How to resolve this?

Wait, maybe the arc FB is not the longer arc, but the shorter one. Let me calculate the shorter arc between F and B. If the longer arc is 225°, the shorter is 135°, but the problem says it's 90°. So this suggests that our current setup is incorrect. 

Where is the mistake? It must be in assuming that the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are all 45°, but this leads to a conflict with the given angle FOB being 90°. 

Let me try to find another relation. Since angle FOB is 90°, and it's a central angle, arc FB is 90°. Let me express arc FB in terms of other arcs. 

From point F to B, the arc can be calculated as follows: from F to A is x (45°), from A to B is 180°, so arc FB is 45° + 180° = 225°, which is the longer arc. But the shorter arc is 360° - 225° = 135°, which is not 90°. 

This implies that our current setup is missing something. Perhaps there's another arc that we haven't considered? Like the arc from C to somewhere?

Since EC is a diameter, point C is opposite E. Let me try to find the position of point C. If E is at some position, then C is 180° away. 

Let me try to determine the position of E. From earlier, if we move from B through D (45°), then to E (another 45°), so point E is 90° from B. Assuming B is at 0°, then E would be at 90°. Then, since EC is a diameter, point C is at 90° + 180° = 270°. 

Now, point F is 45° from E, so from E at 90°, adding 45° gives F at 135°. Then, from F to A is 45°, so A is at 135° + 45° = 180°, which is correct, since AB is a diameter, so A is at 180°, B at 0°, which makes sense.

Now, point F is at 135°, and point B is at 0°. The arc from F to B is the smaller arc, which is 135° - 0° = 135°, but the problem says it should be 90°. This discrepancy suggests that there's an error in our assumptions.

Wait, but the problem states that angle FOB is a right angle. If point F is at 135°, and point B is at 0°, then the central angle FOB is the angle between OF (135°) and OB (0°), which is 135°, not 90°. This contradicts the given condition. 

So where is the mistake? It seems that our assumption that the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are each 45° is incorrect, despite the earlier calculation that 4x + 180° = 360° ⇒ x = 45°. 

But this leads to a contradiction with the given angle FOB being 90°. This suggests that there's an error in how we're calculating the angles or arcs. 

Let me reconsider the sum of angles around point O. The angles at O are:

- Angle BOD = x
- Angle DOE = x
- Angle EOF = x
- Angle FOA = x
- Angle AOB = 180°

But wait, these angles might overlap or not cover the entire circle. For example, if we go from B to D to E to F to A, and then back to B, the angles at O are between each consecutive pair. But the angle between A and B is 180°, which is already included. 

However, the total sum of these angles is 4x + 180° = 360°, which gives x = 45°. This seems correct, but it leads to arc FB being 135°, contradicting the given 90°. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement or in our understanding of it. Alternatively, perhaps the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are not all distinct and cover part of the circle, allowing for overlap.

Wait, maybe the angle FOA is not the full angle from F to A, but part of it? No, angle FOA is a central angle, so it should span from F to A. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are not all the angles around O, but some of them are overlapping. For example, if point F is positioned such that angle FOA is part of the angle AOB.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Let's forget about the previous calculations and focus on the given conditions:

- EC and AB are diameters.
- Angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are congruent.
- Angle FOB is 90°.

Let me try to use coordinates again. Let's place O at (0,0). Let me choose coordinates such that:

- Let AB be a horizontal diameter. Let me set point B at (1, 0), so point A is at (-1, 0).
- EC is another diameter. Let me choose point E at (0, 1), so point C is at (0, -1).
- Now, we need to find positions for D and F such that the angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are congruent, and angle FOB is 90°.

Let me start by finding point D. Angle BOD is congruent to the others. Let me denote each angle as x. 

Starting with angle BOD: this is the angle between OB and OD. Since OB is from O(0,0) to B(1,0), which is along the positive x-axis. Let me assume that point D is somewhere on the circle such that angle BOD = x. Similarly, angle DOE is between OD and OE. Since OE is from O(
