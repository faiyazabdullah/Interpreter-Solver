MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have a circle G with points A, C, D, F, E, H. The problem mentions chords AC and DF being equidistant from the center. The radius of the circle is 26. We need to find the length of chord AC. The answer choices are A. 5, B. 10, C. 13, D. 48.

Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. Circle G has radius 26. So, every radius like GA, GD, etc., should be 26 units long. Wait, the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(G,A), Circle(G)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,A)), 26). So GA is a radius, hence its length is 26. Similarly, GD is also a radius because Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), 26). That means points A and D are on the circle, since GA and GD are radii.

Next, there are two chords: AC and DF. Both are chords of circle G. Also, it's stated that E is the midpoint of AC, and H is the midpoint of DF. Additionally, there are right angles at E and H: Angle(G,E,A) is a right angle, and Angle(G,H,D) is also a right angle. 

Wait, so point E is the midpoint of chord AC. Since GA is a radius, and E is the midpoint of AC, maybe we can form a right triangle here? Let me think. Because if a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. But here, the radius GA isn't necessarily perpendicular to AC unless the angle at E is right. Wait, but the problem says that Angle(G, E, A) is a right angle. That would mean that triangle GEA is a right triangle with the right angle at E. Similarly for triangle GHD.

So, since E is the midpoint of AC, AE = EC. And since GA is a radius (length 26), and GE is part of that. Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,E)), 10). So GE is 10 units long. Then, in triangle GEA, which is a right triangle at E, we have legs GE and EA, and hypotenuse GA. 

Using Pythagoras: GE² + EA² = GA². Plugging in numbers: 10² + EA² = 26². So 100 + EA² = 676 → EA² = 576 → EA = 24. Therefore, the entire chord AC is twice EA, so 2*24=48. Wait, but that would make AC=48, which is option D. However, let me check if there's more to consider.

But wait, the problem states that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. The distance from the center to a chord is determined by the length of the chord. For a chord of length l in a circle of radius r, the distance d from the center to the chord is given by d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)²). 

Alternatively, since we found that for chord AC, the distance from the center G to the chord AC is GE, which is 10 units. Wait, but how do we know that GE is the distance from the center to the chord? Because E is the midpoint of AC, and if the radius GA is perpendicular to AC, then GE would be the distance. But in our case, the right angle is at E, so triangle GEA is right-angled at E. Hence, GE is perpendicular to AC, making GE the distance from the center G to the chord AC. 

Similarly, for chord DF, since H is the midpoint and angle at H is right, then GH is perpendicular to DF, and GH is 10 units (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,H)), 10)). Thus, both chords AC and DF are at distance 10 from the center, which matches the condition that they're equidistant. 

Therefore, for chord AC, the length is 2*sqrt(r² - d²) where d=10, r=26. So sqrt(26² - 10²)=sqrt(676-100)=sqrt(576)=24. Hence, AC=2*24=48. Which would be answer D. But wait, looking back at the answer options, D is 48. But why does the problem mention that chords are equidistant? Because both chords have the same distance from the center, which is 10, leading to same length. So the calculation seems straightforward. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says "find AC". According to my calculation, it's 48. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming that GE is the distance? Let me confirm. 

Since E is the midpoint of AC, and angle at E is right, then GE is perpendicular to AC. Therefore, GE is indeed the distance from the center G to chord AC. So yes, that gives us the formula. So the calculation holds. 

But let me check again the steps. Given that GA is 26, GE is 10, then EA is sqrt(26² -10²)=24. So AC is 2*24=48. So the answer should be D. But why is there an option D? Let me check the answer choices again. Yes, D is 48. 

However, sometimes problems may have tricks. Let me see if there's another way this could be approached. Suppose someone thought that the distance from the center to the chord is not GE, but something else. But according to the given, since E is the midpoint and the right angle exists, GE is perpendicular. So that's correct. 

Another thing: the problem says chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. Since both have distance 10, their lengths are equal. So AC equals DF. But the question asks for AC, so regardless of DF, we just compute AC. 

Thus, the answer is D. 48. But wait, the answer choices include D as 48. So the answer is D. 

But wait, the initial calculation was for AC. But maybe I messed up the steps. Let me recheck. 

In the right triangle GEA: GE=10, GA=26, so EA= sqrt(26² -10²)=sqrt(676-100)=sqrt(576)=24. Then AC is twice EA, so 48. Correct. So answer D. 

But the options are A.5, B.10, C.13, D.48. So D is correct. So the answer is D. 

Wait, but maybe the problem expects using some other method? Like using midline or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the chords are not horizontal or vertical, but the distance is still computed via the formula. 

Yes, the formula for chord length is 2√(r² -d²), where d is the distance from the center. Here, d=10, so chord length is 2√(26² -10²)=2*24=48. So D is correct. 

Hence, the answer is D.
