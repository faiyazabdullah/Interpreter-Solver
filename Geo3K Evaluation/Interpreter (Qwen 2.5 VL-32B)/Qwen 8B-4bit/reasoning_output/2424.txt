MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

Starting with the points and lines. There's a circle O, and several points A, B, C, D, E, G. Lines AB, CD, CE, BG, AG are mentioned. Also, there are angles at points C, A, B; C, G, E; and B, G, E. The measure of angle CAB is 60 degrees, angle CGE is a right angle (90 degrees). Points A, B, C, D, E lie on circle O. Additionally, lines AB and CD intersect at point G. 

So first, since all these points are on circle O, maybe we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. Let me sketch mentally: Points A, B, C, D, E are on the same circle. Lines AB and CD intersect at G. So G is inside the circle? Wait, but if two chords intersect inside a circle, there's a property about the products of their segments. But maybe more importantly, angles formed by intersecting chords... Oh right! When two chords intersect, the measure of the angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Alternatively, the angle is half the difference if it's outside, but here it's inside. 

But also, there's the given angles. Angle CAB is 60 degrees. Since CAB is an inscribed angle, it intercepts arc CB. Because angle at point A subtended by points C and B. So the measure of arc CB would be twice that, so 120 degrees. 

Then, angle CGE is a right angle. That's given. So angle at G between points C and E is 90 degrees. Since G lies on lines AB and CD, perhaps there's some relationship here. Also, since points C, D, E are on the circle, line CE is a chord. And line CD is another chord. Their intersection is at G. 

Wait, angle CGE is 90 degrees. So angle at G between C and E. Since G is the intersection of AB and CD. Let me think. Maybe we can use the fact that angle CGE is formed by two chords, EC and GC. But wait, EC is part of line CE, and GC is part of line CD. Wait, line CD passes through G, so line CD intersects CE at point C? No, because line CE starts at C and goes to E. Wait, line CD connects points C and D, so it's a chord from C to D. Then line CE is another chord from C to E. So lines CD and CE meet at point C. But where does G come into play? 

Wait, earlier it says IntersectionOf(Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Point(G)). So lines AB and CD intersect at point G. So G is the intersection of AB and CD. Therefore, line AB crosses line CD at G. So point G is not on CE unless specified. But CE is a separate line. 

Now, angle CGE is at point G, between points C and E. So that means line GC and line GE form the angle. Wait, but point E is on the circle. So line GE connects G to E. Hmm. How does that fit?

Let me try to visualize. Points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle. Line AB is connected, and line CD is connected, intersecting at G. So G is inside the circle. Now, angle at G between C and E is 90 degrees. So angle CGE = 90°. 

Since G is the intersection of AB and CD, maybe we can use power of a point, or properties of intersecting chords. Also, since points C, D, E are on the circle, line CE is a chord. So, considering that, maybe triangle CGE has some properties. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, maybe there's a relationship between the arcs it intercepts. For instance, if angle CGE is an inscribed angle, but since G is inside the circle, maybe it's related to the arcs. Wait, the formula for the angle between two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So angle CGE would be (arc CE + arc AB)/2. Wait, no—wait, when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle at G between C and E. So the two intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... Well, the angle is formed by chords GC and GE. So the intercepted arcs would be arc from C to E that doesn't pass through G, and the opposite arc? Wait, actually, when two chords intersect at G, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Let me recall: If two chords intersect at G inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So angle CGE is formed by chords GC and GE. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... Well, the other arc that's opposite. Wait, maybe arc that's opposite to angle CGE. Wait, perhaps it's the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. Let me think again. 

When two chords intersect at G, forming four angles. Each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, angle CGE would intercept arcs that are opposite. So angle CGE intercepts arc CE and arc... Wait, suppose the chords are CD and CE. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

Actually, angle CGE is formed by two chords: one is GC (part of CD) and the other is GE (which connects G to E). Wait, but GE isn't necessarily a chord unless E is connected to G. However, E is on the circle. So GE is a line from G (inside the circle) to E (on the circle). So GE is a secant line starting at G and passing through E. Similarly, GC is part of line CD, which is a chord from C to D. 

Therefore, the angle at G between GC and GE would intercept arcs. According to the intersecting chords angle formula, the measure of angle CGE is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Which arcs are those? It should be the arcs intercepted by the angles formed by the two chords. So angle CGE intercepts arcs CE and the arc that's opposite. Wait, maybe the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two pairs of vertical angles. For example, angle CGE would intercept arcs that are opposite. Let me look up the exact theorem. 

The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle CGE is formed by chords GC and GE. The intercepted arcs are arc CE and arc... the arc that's opposite. Wait, when two chords intersect at G, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For angle CGE, the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... the arc that's across from the angle. Wait, maybe arc that's formed by the other pair of points. 

Wait, if we have two chords intersecting at G, say chords AC and BD intersecting at G, then the angle at G between A and B would be half the sum of arcs AB and CD. But in our case, the angle is at G between C and E. So maybe the intercepted arcs are arc CE and arc... something else. Wait, but the two chords involved are GC (from G to C) and GE (from G to E). But where do these chords go? GC is part of line CD (since line CD connects C to D and passes through G). GE is a line from G to E, which is on the circle. So the two chords are CD (passing through G) and GE (a secant from G to E). 

Hmm, but GE is just a single segment from G to E, so it's a secant. So angle CGE is formed by the intersection of CD and GE. Wait, but GE is not a chord unless extended. Wait, but E is on the circle, so GE is a segment from G to E. So perhaps we need to consider the arcs intercepted by angle CGE. 

Alternatively, maybe angle CGE is formed by two chords: GC and GE. But GE is a secant that goes from G to E, and GC is part of the chord CD. So the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... maybe arc that's opposite. Wait, perhaps the angle CGE intercepts arc CE and arc... the arc that's across from the angle. Wait, maybe it's the arc that's opposite to angle CGE, which would be arc that's not containing the angle. 

This seems confusing. Let me try another approach. Given that angle CGE is 90°, so according to the intersecting chords angle formula, 90° equals half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So 90 = ½(arc CE + arc ... ). What's the second arc? 

Wait, when two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. In this case, the two intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two pairs of vertical angles. So for angle CGE, which is formed by chords GC and GE, the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... maybe the arc that is opposite. Wait, but GE is a secant going from G to E, and GC is part of CD. So the other intercepted arc would be the arc that is cut off by the other two points. Wait, maybe the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. 

Alternatively, since lines AB and CD intersect at G, and line CE is present. Let me think again. 

We know that angle CAB is 60°, which is an inscribed angle over arc CB. So arc CB is 120°, as inscribed angle is half the arc. 

Also, since points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle, all lying on circle O. So OA=OB=OC=OD=OE, radii of the circle. 

Now, looking at the intersection at G. Since lines AB and CD intersect at G, then by the intersecting chords theorem, the product of the segments of each chord are equal. So GA * GB = GC * GD. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. 

However, the key thing is the angle CGE being 90°, which could imply something about the arcs. Let me try to find the arcs. 

Assume that angle CGE is formed by two chords: GC and GE. These chords intercept arcs. The angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So angle CGE = ½(arc CE + arc ... )? 

Wait, but if we consider the two intercepted arcs, they are the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. So for angle CGE, which is formed by chords GC and GE. Chord GC is part of line CD (from C to D), and chord GE is from G to E. So the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... the arc that is opposite. Wait, but without knowing the other points, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is formed by intersecting chords, maybe the angle relates to arcs that are opposite. For example, if two chords intersect at G, then angle CGE would be ½(arc CE + arc AB)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 60°, which is an inscribed angle over arc CB (120°). Let me note that. 

Now, angle CGE is 90°, so maybe using the intersecting chords formula. Suppose that angle CGE = ½(arc CE + arc something). If I can find that arc, maybe I can get relations. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle CGE is a right triangle. Since angle at G is 90°, so triangle CGE is right-angled at G. So maybe applying Pythagoras? But I don't know the lengths. 

Wait, but since points C and E are on the circle, and G is inside the circle, then CE is a chord. If triangle CGE is right-angled at G, then by Thales' theorem, the hypotenuse would be the diameter. But since G is inside the circle, CE is not necessarily the diameter. Wait, but Thales' theorem applies when the triangle is inscribed in a semicircle. Here, G is inside the circle, so CE could be a diameter. Wait, but if angle CGE is 90°, then CE must be the diameter. Because in a circle, if you have a triangle inscribed with the right angle at a point inside, then the hypotenuse would be the diameter. Wait, no. Wait, Thales' theorem states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. Conversely, if a triangle is right-angled, then its hypotenuse is the diameter. 

But in this case, triangle CGE is right-angled at G. So that implies that CE is the diameter. Therefore, CE must be the diameter of the circle. Hence, the length of CE is twice the radius. 

If that's true, then arc CE would be 180°, since it's a diameter. Then, using the intersecting chords angle formula: angle CGE = ½(arc CE + arc something) = 90°. 

Wait, angle CGE is formed by chords GC and GE. If CE is the diameter, then arc CE is 180°, and the other arc would be...? 

Wait, the formula says angle CGE = ½(arc CE + arc something). But what's the other arc? 

If the two chords are GC and GE, then the intercepted arcs are arc CE and arc... the arc that's opposite. Wait, maybe the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle CGE is formed by two chords intersecting at G, which is the intersection of AB and CD. So the two chords are CD and GE. Wait, but GE is not necessarily a chord unless extended. 

Alternatively, since GE is a line from G to E, and E is on the circle, so GE is a secant. So the angle at G between CD (chord) and GE (secant). 

I think I need to re-examine the intersecting chords angle formula. 

The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, for angle CGE, which is formed by chords GC and GE. 

Chords GC and GE. Wait, but GE is not a chord unless it extends beyond E. However, since E is on the circle, GE is a segment from G (inside) to E (on the circle). So, the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... the arc that's intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles. 

Wait, if we imagine extending the chords, the angle formed at G intercepts two arcs: arc CE and arc that is opposite. Wait, but without knowing the other points, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe angle CGE intercepts arc CB and arc something else. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try another approach. 

Given that angle CAB is 60°, which is inscribed over arc CB. So arc CB = 120°. 

Points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle. So line AB is a chord, and line CD is another chord intersecting at G. 

Also, since angle CGE is 90°, which is a right angle. 

If CE is the diameter, then arc CE is 180°, making angle CGE = 90°, as per Thales' theorem. Wait, but how does that connect? If CE is the diameter, then any triangle with CE as hypotenuse and right angle at G would satisfy that. 

But why would CE be the diameter? Because angle CGE is 90°, implying that CE is the diameter. So if that's the case, then arc CE is 180°. 

Now, if arc CE is 180°, then the rest of the circle is also 180°, but how does that relate to the other arcs? 

Additionally, since points A, B, C are on the circle, and angle CAB is 60°, arc CB is 120°. 

Now, looking at the intersection point G of AB and CD. 

Let me consider the power of point G with respect to circle O. The power of point G is GA * GB = GC * GD. 

But without knowing specific lengths, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and CE is the diameter, then CE is straight across the circle. So coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates hypothetically. 

Suppose the circle has center O, and let’s assume coordinates. Let me place point C at (-r, 0), E at (r, 0), making CE the horizontal diameter. Then, the center O is at (0,0). 

Point A and B are somewhere on the circle such that angle CAB is 60°. Also, lines AB and CD intersect at G. 

But this might take too long. Maybe focusing on arcs. 

Arc CB is 120°, arc CE is 180°, so arc BE would be arc BC plus arc CE minus arc... Wait, arc from B to E. If arc CB is 120°, and arc CE is 180°, then depending on direction. Let me imagine the circle with points C and E diametrically opposed. Point B is somewhere on the circle such that arc CB is 120°, so moving counterclockwise from C to B is 120°, then from B to E would depend on where E is. 

But since E is at the end of the diameter from C, arc from B to E would be arc BE = arc BC + arc CE - arc something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If arc CB is 120°, and arc CE is 180°, then depending on the position of B relative to C and E. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in order C, B, ..., E around the circle. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and CE is the diameter, then GE is perpendicular to GC. Because angle CGE is 90°, so GE ⊥ GC. 

Wait, if GE is perpendicular to GC, then line GE is perpendicular to line GC. 

But line GC is part of line CD. So line CD is perpendicular to line GE at point G. 

But line GE connects G to E, which is on the circle. 

Now, since CD is a chord of the circle, and GE is perpendicular to CD at G, then GE is the tangent to the circle at point E? Wait, no, because G is inside the circle. Wait, if a line is perpendicular to a chord at a point inside the circle, it's not necessarily a tangent. 

But if GE is perpendicular to CD at G, then line GE is the altitude from G to CD. But I don't see how that helps. 

Wait, but since CE is a diameter, and GE is perpendicular to GC (because angle CGE is 90°), then maybe there's a relation between GE and the circle. 

Alternatively, since GE is perpendicular to GC, and GC is part of CD, which is a chord. 

Maybe I can use coordinates. Let me set up coordinates with O at origin. Let me assume circle O has radius r. 

Let me place point C at (-r, 0), E at (r, 0), so CE is the diameter. 

Now, angle CAB is 60°, which is an inscribed angle over arc CB. So arc CB is 120°, so point B is located 120° counterclockwise from C. Since C is at (-r, 0), moving 120° counterclockwise places B at angle θ = 180° - 120° = 60°, so coordinates of B would be (r cos(60°), r sin(60°)) = (r*0.5, r*(√3)/2). 

Now, line AB connects points A and B. We need to define point A. Since A is also on the circle. Let me assume that points A and B are placed such that angle CAB is 60°. Wait, but angle CAB is at point A, between points C and B. Wait, no: angle CAB is at point A, between points C, A, B. Wait, no: the notation Angle(CAB) means the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, no, standard notation: Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(CAB) is the angle at point A between points C and B. 

Wait, that changes things. Earlier assumption was incorrect. So angle CAB is at point A, between points C and B. So vertex at A, with sides AC and AB. 

Ah, that's different. So angle at A between C and B. So that means points C, A, B are such that A is the vertex. So line AC and line AB form angle CAB at A. 

So in my coordinate system, point A is somewhere on the circle. 

With point C at (-r, 0), point B at (r*0.5, r*(√3)/2). Let me pick point A such that angle CAB is 60°. 

To make this manageable, let me choose specific coordinates. Assume unit circle for simplicity, r=1. 

So C is (-1, 0), E is (1, 0). 

Point B is at 60°, which is (cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, √3/2). 

Now, angle CAB is 60°, with vertex at A. So points C(-1,0), A, B(0.5, √3/2). 

We need to find coordinates of A such that angle CAB is 60°. 

Let me denote point A as (x, y) on the unit circle, so x² + y² = 1. 

Vector AC is from A to C: (-1 - x, 0 - y). Vector AB is from A to B: (0.5 - x, √3/2 - y). 

The angle between vectors AC and AB is 60°. 

Using the dot product: cos(theta) = (AC · AB) / (|AC| |AB|)

So cos(60°) = 0.5 = [( -1 - x)(0.5 - x) + (0 - y)(√3/2 - y)] / (|AC| |AB| )

This equation needs to be solved for x and y satisfying x² + y² = 1. This might be complicated, but maybe there's symmetry. 

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 60°, and points C and B are fixed, maybe point A is located symmetrically. 

For example, if I assume that point A is at (1, 0), but that would make angle CAB undefined because points C, A, B would not form the angle correctly. 

Alternatively, suppose point A is at (cos(θ), sin(θ)). 

But this might require solving equations. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 60°, and points A, B, C are on the circle, then arc CB is 120°, as before. 

So with C at (-1, 0) and B at 60°, arc CB is 120°, which fits. 

Now, point A is another point on the circle. The angle at A between C and B is 60°, so the arc CB is 120°, which corresponds to the inscribed angle. 

Now, back to the main problem: finding m∠BGE. 

Point G is the intersection of AB and CD. 

We need to find the measure of angle at G between points B, G, E. 

Since E is at (1, 0), and G is the intersection of AB and CD. 

But we need to find coordinates of G. To do that, we need to define line CD. 

But where is point D? All points C, D, E are on the circle. So D is another point on the circle. 

But without knowing where D is, it's difficult. However, since lines CD and AB intersect at G, and we know that angle CGE is 90°. 

But earlier assumption that CE is the diameter led us to angle CGE being 90°, which may not hold unless specific conditions. 

Wait, if CE is the diameter, then angle CGE is 90°, which is given. So that suggests that CE is indeed the diameter. Thus, E is the antipodal point of C. 

Thus, in our coordinate system, C is (-1, 0), E is (1, 0). 

Now, line CD connects C(-1, 0) to D, which is another point on the circle. 

But since line CD passes through G, which is the intersection of AB and CD. 

We need to find coordinates of D. However, without more info, it's challenging. 

But since angle CGE is 90°, and G is the intersection of AB and CD. 

Let me try to find G. 

First, find line AB. Point A is somewhere on the circle, and point B is (0.5, √3/2). 

But to define line AB, we need coordinates of A. 

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 60°, and points C, A, B are on the circle, we can use the previous setup. 

Let me assume that point A is at (cos(θ), sin(θ)). Then, using the condition that angle CAB is 60°, which we can translate into an equation. 

Alternatively, since arc CB is 120°, and angle at A is 60°, which is half of that. So point A can be anywhere on the circumcircle such that it doesn't interfere with the arc. 

But perhaps choosing a specific position for A simplifies the problem. Let me assume that point A is at (0, 1), the top of the circle. 

Let me check if angle CAB would be 60° in that case. 

Point C is (-1, 0), A is (0, 1), B is (0.5, √3/2). 

Vectors AC and AB: 

Vector AC = C - A = (-1 - 0, 0 - 1) = (-1, -1)

Vector AB = B - A = (0.5 - 0, √3/2 - 1) = (0.5, (√3/2 - 1)) 

Dot product of AC and AB is (-1)(0.5) + (-1)(√3/2 - 1) = -0.5 - √3/2 + 1 = 0.5 - √3/2 ≈ 0.5 - 0.866 ≈ -0.366 

Magnitude of AC is sqrt((-1)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2) 

Magnitude of AB is sqrt((0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 - 1)^2). Let me compute:

0.5^2 = 0.25 

(sqrt(3)/2 - 1)^2 = (approx 0.866 - 1)^2 = (-0.134)^2 ≈ 0.018 

Total magnitude squared is approx 0.25 + 0.018 = 0.268 → magnitude ~0.517 

So cos(theta) = (-0.366)/(sqrt(2)*0.517) ≈ (-0.366)/(1.414*0.517) ≈ -0.366/0.731 ≈ -0.501 

Which is approximately cos(120°), which would mean theta is 120°, not 60°. So this placement of A gives angle CAB as 120°, not 60°. So that's not correct. 

So point A cannot be at (0,1). Let me think. 

Since arc CB is 120°, and angle CAB is 60°, which is half the arc CB. So point A must be on the arc that doesn't contain B. Wait, inscribed angle theorem: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

So if angle CAB intercepts arc CB, then arc CB is 120°, which it is. So point A must be on the circumference such that it doesn't lie on the arc CB. Wait, the inscribed angle intercepts arc CB, so point A must be on the opposite arc from CB. 

In our setup, arc CB is 120°, so the remaining arc is 240°. So point A is somewhere on the major arc CB. 

Let me choose point A such that it's on the major arc CB. For simplicity, let me choose point A at (1, 0), but that's point E, which is already taken. Or maybe at (cos(θ), sin(θ)) where θ is such that it's on the major arc. 

Alternatively, let me take point A such that it forms an equilateral triangle with C and B. 

Wait, if angle CAB is 60°, and points C, A, B are on the circle, maybe triangle ABC is equilateral? But not necessarily, since AB is a chord, and AC and AB are not necessarily equal. 

Alternatively, let me assume that point A is located such that arc CA is equal to arc AB. But this is speculative. 

This is getting too complex without precise coordinates. Perhaps I need to use the intersecting chords theorem and the angle relations. 

Earlier, I thought that angle CGE = 90° implies that CE is the diameter. If that's true, then arc CE is 180°, and thus, the angle at G is formed by two chords, GC and GE, which intercept arcs CE (180°) and another arc. 

According to the intersecting chords angle formula: angle CGE = ½(arc CE + arc something). Since angle CGE is 90°, then 90 = ½(180 + arc something). Solving, 180 + arc something = 180 → arc something = 0°, which is impossible. So that suggests my assumption that CE is the diameter is wrong. 

Wait, this indicates a mistake in assuming that CE is the diameter. So perhaps angle CGE is formed by two other arcs. 

Let me revisit the intersecting chords angle formula. For angle formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, the measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle CGE is formed by chords GC and GE. These two chords intercept arcs. 

The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. Specifically, angle CGE intercepts arc CE and the arc that is opposite to it. Wait, but how? 

If two chords intersect at G, then each angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at G, then angle AGC is half the sum of arcs AC and BD. 

Applying this to our case: angle CGE is formed by chords GC and GE. Wait, but GE is a single chord? Or is it part of another chord? 

Actually, GE is a single chord from G to E. But since E is on the circle, GE is a secant line. The other chord is GC, which is part of CD. So the two intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... the arc that is intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles. 

Wait, if we consider the two chords: GC (part of CD) and GE (from G to E), then the intercepted arcs would be arc CE and arc... the arc that is opposite, which would be arc... let's say, the arc that is not containing the angle. 

But without knowing the other points, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since lines AB and CD intersect at G, and line CE is present, maybe there's another relation. 

Let me try to use the given information that angle CAB is 60°, which gives arc CB as 120°. Also, angle CGE is 90°, which is given. 

Now, since points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle, let's consider the full circle. 

If I can find the measure of arc BE or other arcs, maybe I can find the desired angle. 

Let me consider the intersection at G. By the intersecting chords theorem, GA * GB = GC * GD. 

But without specific lengths, this might not help. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and using the intersecting chords angle formula, 90° = ½(arc CE + arc something). Let's call the other arc as arc x. So 90 = ½(arc CE + x), so arc CE + x = 180°. 

But what is arc x? It depends on the configuration. 

If I can express arc CE in terms of other arcs. 

Since arc CB is 120°, and if we can relate arc CE to other arcs, maybe we can find x. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but line CD passes through G, and point D is on the circle. So line CD is a chord from C to D, passing through G. 

If I can find the measure of arc CD, or relate it to other arcs. 

But this is still unclear. 

Let me think differently. Let's focus on angle BGE. The question asks for the measure of angle BGE. 

Point G is the intersection of AB and CD. 

So angle BGE is at point G, between points B, G, E. 

So this is the angle formed by lines GB and GE. 

To find this angle, we can use the intersecting chords angle formula. 

Angle BGE is formed by chords GB and GE. 

These two chords intercept arcs. 

According to the formula, angle BGE = ½(arc BE + arc something). 

What is the "something"? 

It depends on which arcs are intercepted. 

If angle BGE is formed by chords GB and GE, then the intercepted arcs are arc BE and the arc that is opposite. 

But since GB is part of line AB, and GE is part of line GE (to E), the intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite, which would be arc... perhaps the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. 

Alternatively, since GB is part of AB, and GE is part of GE, the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite to the angle. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, using the intersecting chords theorem, angle BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD), assuming that line AB and CD intersect at G. 

Wait, no. The general formula is that when two chords intersect, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle at G between B and E. The two chords are GB (part of AB) and GE (part of GE). 

Wait, but GE is a single chord from G to E, so the intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... the arc that is intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles. 

But without knowing the other points, it's hard to say. 

But if I consider that angle BGE is formed by chords GB and GE, then the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite. 

Assume that arc BE is one arc, and the other arc is arc... let's say arc AD or something else. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard. 

Wait, but since points A, B, C, D, E are all on the circle, and lines AB and CD intersect at G, perhaps there's a relation between arcs. 

Let me try to use the fact that angle CAB is 60°, giving arc CB = 120°, and angle CGE is 90°, leading to some relation. 

Let me consider the total circle: 360°. 

If arc CB is 120°, and arc CE is something, and arc BE is something, etc. 

Alternatively, let me consider that angle BGE is formed by lines GB and GE. Using the intersecting chords angle formula, it would be ½(arc BE + arc CD). 

Wait, no, it depends on which arcs are intercepted. 

Alternatively, since GB is part of AB, and GE is part of GE, the angle at G is formed by these two lines. 

But I'm stuck. 

Let me try to think about the answer options. The options are 60°, 120°, 240°, 360°. 

Since angle CGE is 90°, and angle CAB is 60°, likely the answer is 120° or 60°. 

But how? 

Wait, if angle BGE is supplementary to angle CGE, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and angle CAB is 60°, maybe there's a relationship. 

Another idea: since points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle, and lines AB and CD intersect at G, then by the Power of a Point theorem, GA * GB = GC * GD. 

But without knowing specific lengths, this might not help. 

Wait, but if I consider triangles involving these points. 

For example, triangle BGE: we need to find angle at G. 

If I can find the arcs that correspond to this angle. 

Let me try to use the fact that angle BGE is formed by two chords: GB and GE. 

So, angle BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD). Wait, why AD? Because the other intercepted arc would be the one opposite. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since lines AB and CD intersect at G, the angle BGE is formed by GB (part of AB) and GE (part of GE). 

But GE is a line from G to E, which is on the circle. 

So, the intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. 

Wait, if I consider the two chords GB and GE, then the angle at G would intercept arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite, which would be arc... perhaps arc AD, but I don't know where D is. 

This is too vague. 

Maybe I need to use the given that angle CAB is 60°, arc CB is 120°, and angle CGE is 90°, to find relations between arcs. 

Let me assume that arc CB is 120°, arc CE is x, and arc BE is y. 

Since the total circle is 360°, arc CB + arc BE + arc ED + arc DA + arc AC = 360°, but this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and it's formed by chords GC and GE, then 90 = ½(arc CE + arc something). 

If I can express arc CE in terms of other arcs. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard. 

Wait, but since line CD passes through G, and C is on the circle, D is another point on the circle. So line CD is a chord, and G is inside the circle. 

Maybe I can relate arc CD to other arcs. 

But I'm running out of ideas. 

Let me try to think about the answer choices. If angle BGE is 120°, then that would make sense if it's supplementary to angle CGE (90°), but not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 60°, and angle CGE is 90°, and they're both inscribed or related angles, maybe angle BGE is 120°. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, another approach: since all points are on the circle, and G is the intersection of AB and CD, then by the intersecting chords theorem, the angles formed at G relate to the arcs. 

Let me recall that the measure of angle BGE is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, that's for when the angle is outside the circle. 

Wait, for an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But for an angle formed inside the circle, it's half the sum. 

So angle BGE is formed by two lines: GB (which is part of AB) and GE (which is a secant to E). Wait, but GB is part of AB, which is a chord, and GE is a secant from G to E. 

So, if G is inside the circle, then angle BGE is formed by two chords: GB and GE. 

Thus, the measure of angle BGE is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite. 

Wait, when two chords intersect at G, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So angle BGE is formed by chords GB and GE, so the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite, which would be the arc that is not containing the angle. 

But what is that arc? It would be the arc that is opposite to arc BE, which would be the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. 

But since line AB passes through G, and line CD passes through G, maybe the other arc is related to arc CD. 

This is too abstract. 

Alternatively, since angle BGE is formed by GB and GE, the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc... the arc that is intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles, which would be arc AD. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to say. 

But perhaps there's a relation between arc BE and arc AD due to the intersecting chords. 

Since lines AB and CD intersect at G, then by the intersecting chords theorem, GA * GB = GC * GD. 

But without knowing the lengths, it's not helpful. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. 

Let me recall that angle CAB is 60°, arc CB is 120°. 

If I can find arc BE, then maybe I can find angle BGE. 

Since angle BGE is formed by lines GB and GE, which would be half the sum of arc BE and arc... 

Wait, if angle BGE is formed by chords GB and GE, then the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc... the arc that is intercepted by the other intersection. 

But if I consider the other intersection, which is line CD. 

Wait, since line CD passes through G, and point D is on the circle, then arc CD is some value. 

But I don't know. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and it's formed by chords GC and GE, then 90 = ½(arc CE + arc something). 

If I can find arc CE, then I can find the something. 

But how? 

If I can relate arc CE to other arcs. 

Let me assume that arc CB is 120°, arc BE is x, arc ED is y, and arc DC is z. 

But this is too many variables. 

Alternatively, since points C, D, E are on the circle, and line CD passes through G, maybe arc CD is related to other arcs. 

But I'm not making progress. 

Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that angle BGE is 120°, as it's supplementary to 60° or related to the given 90°. 

Alternatively, since angle CGE is 90°, and angle CAB is 60°, and they are both related to arcs, perhaps angle BGE is 120°. 

So, I'll go with option B: 120°.
