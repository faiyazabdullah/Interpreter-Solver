MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle DEFG, right? And there are some points mentioned like A and C. But the main focus here is on angles at point D and F. Let me start by recalling the properties of a rectangle.

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each corner should be 90 degrees. Wait, but the problem gives us expressions involving x for two angles: m∠EDF = 5x - 3 and m∠DFG = 3x + 7. Hmm, these angles are probably adjacent angles in the rectangle?

Wait, let me visualize the rectangle. Let me sketch it mentally. Points D, E, F, G forming a rectangle. So, sides DE, EF, FG, GD. Then, diagonals DF and EG intersect at point A. Oh, because the predicate says IntersectionOf(Line(D,F), Line(E,G), Point(A)). So diagonals cross at point A.

Now, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Also, they form vertical angles. But how do the angles ∠EDF and ∠DFG come into play?

Let me think about ∠EDF. That would be the angle at point D between ED and DF. Since ED is one side of the rectangle, and DF is a diagonal. Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at point F between DF and FG. 

Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle at D (which is angle EDF) and angle at F (angle DFG) – wait, maybe those angles are part of the triangle formed by the diagonal. Let me consider triangle DGF? Or maybe triangle DEF?

Alternatively, since DF is a diagonal, splitting the rectangle into two triangles. In a rectangle, the diagonals split it into congruent triangles. So triangle DGF and triangle DFE?

But angle EDF is part of triangle D-E-F? Wait, point D connected to E and F. So triangle D-E-F. Wait, but in the rectangle, DE is horizontal, DF is diagonal. So angle at D between DE and DF. Similarly, angle DFG is at point F between DF and FG.

Hmm. Now, in a rectangle, consecutive angles are supplementary. But since it's a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. However, the angles we're dealing with here are not the corners of the rectangle, but angles formed by the diagonal with the sides.

So, let's consider triangle D-E-F. Wait, but DF is a diagonal. So, in triangle D-E-F, angle at D is ∠EDF, which is given as 5x - 3. Also, since DEFG is a rectangle, DE is perpendicular to DG. Wait, DG is another side. Maybe I need to look at the properties of the triangle formed by the diagonal.

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Also, each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles. Therefore, triangle D-E-F and triangle D-G-F are congruent. Wait, but maybe more importantly, each of those triangles is a right triangle? No, because the diagonal splits the rectangle into two triangles, each of which has one right angle. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, if you draw a diagonal from D to F in rectangle DEFG, then triangle DEF would have vertices D, E, F. In this case, DE and DF are sides of the rectangle? Wait, DE is a side, EF is another side. Wait, DE and EF are adjacent sides of the rectangle, meeting at E. So, triangle DEF would have sides DE, EF, and DF. But since DE and EF are perpendicular (as they are sides of a rectangle), triangle DEF is a right triangle with right angle at E. Wait, but ∠EDF is the angle at D, so in triangle DEF, angle at D is ∠EDF, which is given as 5x - 3. Similarly, angle at F in triangle DFG would be ∠DFG, given as 3x + 7.

Wait, but triangle DFG would also be a right triangle? Because FG is a side of the rectangle, and DG is another side. Wait, maybe not directly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, considering that DF is a diagonal, so in triangle DFG, angle at F is ∠DFG, and FG is a side of the rectangle, so FG is perpendicular to GF? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Another approach: since DEFG is a rectangle, then angle at D is 90 degrees. So, angle between DE and DG is 90 degrees. But DF is a diagonal from D to F. So, angle EDF is between DE and DF. Let me denote that angle as α = 5x - 3. Similarly, angle DFG is the angle between DF and FG. Let me call that β = 3x + 7.

Now, since DF is a diagonal, and in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. Also, the diagonals divide the rectangle into two congruent triangles. So, triangle D-E-F and triangle D-G-F are congruent. Therefore, angles opposite corresponding sides would be equal. Wait, but maybe looking at the angles around point D and F.

Alternatively, since DE and FG are opposite sides of the rectangle, they are equal and parallel. Similarly, EF and DG are equal and parallel.

But focusing on angles α and β. Let me consider the fact that in triangle D-E-F, angle at D is α, angle at E is 90 degrees (since it's a rectangle), and angle at F would be something. Wait, but triangle DEF has angles summing to 180 degrees. So:

α + 90° + angle at F = 180°

Similarly, in triangle DFG, angle at F is β, angle at G is 90°, and angle at D would be something. Wait, but maybe that's not helpful yet.

Alternatively, since DF is a diagonal, the angles α and β could be complementary? Wait, because in the rectangle, the diagonal creates two angles at each corner. For example, at point D, the diagonal DF splits the 90-degree angle into two parts: α and another angle. Similarly, at point F, the diagonal DF splits the 90-degree angle into β and another angle.

Wait, yes! At point D, the original angle of the rectangle is 90 degrees. The diagonal DF splits that angle into two angles: ∠EDF (which is α = 5x - 3) and another angle, say γ. So, α + γ = 90°. Similarly, at point F, the original angle of the rectangle is 90 degrees, which is split into ∠DFG (β = 3x + 7) and another angle δ. So, β + δ = 90°.

But since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, maybe there's a relationship between α and β? Wait, maybe not directly. Alternatively, considering that the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent, so angles α and β could be related?

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Since DEFG is a rectangle, then DG is parallel to EF, and DE is parallel to FG. So, when you draw diagonal DF, the angles formed at D and F might have some relation due to alternate interior angles or something.

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to FG, and DF is a transversal. So, the angle between DE and DF (∠EDF = α) and the angle between FG and DF (∠DFG = β) might be equal? Wait, because DE || FG and DF is a transversal, so alternate interior angles would be equal. Therefore, α = β?

Wait, that seems promising. If DE is parallel to FG, and DF is a transversal cutting them, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. So, ∠EDF (between DE and DF) equals ∠DFG (between FG and DF). Hence, α = β.

Therefore, 5x - 3 = 3x + 7. Solving this equation:

5x - 3 = 3x + 7  
Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 3 = 7  
Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 10  
Divide by 2: x = 5

Then, substitute back into either expression for the angle. Let's take m∠EDF = 5x - 3:

5(5) - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22. So, the measure is 22 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, A is 22. But wait, let me check if my assumption that α = β is correct.

Is DE parallel to FG? Yes, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So DE and FG are opposite sides, hence parallel. DF is a transversal crossing them. Therefore, the alternate interior angles are equal. Thus, ∠EDF and ∠DFG are alternate interior angles, so they should be equal. Therefore, my reasoning holds.

So solving gives x=5, leading to m∠EDF = 22°, which corresponds to option A. But wait, let me verify once more.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming alternate interior angles. Let me confirm the configuration. DE is one side, going from D to E. FG is the opposite side, from F to G. DF connects D to F. So, DE and FG are parallel. The transversal DF crosses DE at D and FG at F. Therefore, the angle between DE and DF at D (∠EDF) and the angle between FG and DF at F (∠DFG) are indeed alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. So the equation is valid.

Thus, solving gives x=5, leading to 5*5-3=22. So answer A. But let me check if there's another way to get conflicting results.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle DFG. Suppose that angle DFG is β, and since in the rectangle, angle at F is 90 degrees. So, the diagonal splits that 90-degree angle into two parts: β and another angle. But if DE is parallel to FG, then maybe the other angle at D is equal to β? Not sure.

Alternatively, if I use the fact that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but that may not directly affect the angles unless combined with other info.

But given that the alternate interior angles are equal, and solving gives 22, which is option A. However, sometimes problems may involve supplementary angles instead. Let me check again.

Wait, suppose that instead of being alternate interior angles, they are something else. For instance, maybe they are same-side interior angles? Wait, if DE and FG are parallel, and DF is a transversal, then the angles on the same side would be supplementary. Wait, but which ones?

Same-side interior angles would be the angle at D (α) and the angle at F (β) on the same side of the transversal DF. Wait, but if DE and FG are parallel, then the same-side interior angles would add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion. Which is correct?

Hold on, this is critical. Let me re-examine the configuration.

Imagine DE and FG are two parallel lines, with DE above FG. The transversal DF goes from D (on DE) to F (on FG). The angles formed at D and F by the transversal DF. So, the angle between DE and DF at D (∠EDF) and the angle between FG and DF at F (∠DFG) are on the same side of the transversal DF. Therefore, they are same-side interior angles, which would be supplementary. Hence, α + β = 180 degrees.

Wait, but that conflicts with the previous thought. Which is correct?

This depends on whether the angles are on the same side or opposite sides of the transversal. Let me visualize:

DE is horizontal, going from left to right. FG is parallel to DE, also horizontal. DF is a diagonal from D (left end of DE) to F (right end of FG). Wait, but in a rectangle, the order of the points is such that DEFG forms a rectangle. So, starting at D, moving to E, then to F, then to G, then back to D. So, the rectangle's sides are DE, EF, FG, GD.

So, points D and F are opposite corners. So, DE is one side, EF is next, FG is next, GD completes the rectangle. So, DF is a diagonal connecting D to F. Now, DE is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), FG is also horizontal, parallel to DE. The diagonal DF goes from D to F, which is from bottom-left to top-right (if the rectangle is oriented normally).

In this case, the transversal DF crosses DE at D and FG at F. The angle between DE and DF at D (∠EDF) is on one side of DF, and the angle between FG and DF at F (∠DFG) is on the same side of DF. Hence, they are same-side interior angles. Therefore, they should add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but that would mean α + β = 180°, which contradicts the earlier conclusion of equality. So where is the mistake?

Earlier, I thought they were alternate interior angles, but that's incorrect. They are actually same-side interior angles. Hence, α + β = 180°, not α = β.

Oh no, this changes everything. So my initial assumption was wrong. So that means I need to set up the equation:

5x - 3 + 3x + 7 = 180  
Combine terms: 8x + 4 = 180  
Subtract 4: 8x = 176  
Divide by 8: x = 22  

Wait, but substituting x=22 into 5x-3 gives 5*22-3=110-3=107, and 3x+7=66+7=73. 107 + 73 = 180, which checks out. But then, the question asks for m∠EDF, which is 5x-3=107. But 107 isn't among the answer choices. The options are A.22, B.45, C.68, D.90. None of these match 107. This suggests a contradiction. So there's a mistake in my reasoning here.

Wait, this indicates a problem. Where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine the configuration.

Maybe the angles aren't same-side interior angles. Perhaps the direction of the transversal matters. Let me think again.

If DE is parallel to FG, and DF is a transversal, then the angles formed at D and F depend on the direction of the transversal. Let me imagine DE as horizontal, going from D (left) to E (right). FG is parallel to DE, going from F (left) to G (right). But in the rectangle, point F is connected to E and G. So, if DEFG is the rectangle, then the order of the points implies that E is connected to F, so the rectangle goes D-E-F-G-D. Therefore, DE is one side, EF is the next, FG is the third, and GD is the fourth.

So, in this case, the diagonal DF connects D to F. Let me try to assign coordinates to make it clearer. Let me place point D at (0,0), E at (a,0), F at (a,b), and G at (0,b). So DE is from (0,0) to (a,0); EF is from (a,0) to (a,b); FG is from (a,b) to (0,b); and GD is from (0,b) to (0,0). Wait, no, that would make FG from (a,b) to (0,b)? Wait, no, if the rectangle is D-E-F-G-D, then after E(a,0), moving to F, which would be (a,b), then from F(a,b) to G, which would be (0,b), then back to D(0,0). Wait, but that would make FG from (a,b) to (0,b), which is a horizontal line to the left. Then GD is from (0,b) down to (0,0). 

In this coordinate system, DF is the diagonal from D(0,0) to F(a,b). So the slope of DF is b/a. Now, the angle ∠EDF is the angle at D between DE (along x-axis from D(0,0) to E(a,0)) and DF (from D(0,0) to F(a,b)). So that angle is between the positive x-axis and the line DF. Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at F between DF and FG. FG is from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is along the negative x-direction. So, the angle at F between DF and FG is the angle between DF (going from F(a,b) to D(0,0)) and FG (going from F(a,b) to G(0,b)).

To compute these angles, maybe using slopes or vectors.

For ∠EDF: It's the angle between vector DE (which is along positive x-axis) and vector DF (which goes from D(0,0) to F(a,b), so direction vector (a,b)). The tangent of this angle is the slope of DF, which is rise over run: b/a. So tan(α) = b/a.

For ∠DFG: At point F(a,b), FG goes to G(0,b), which is left along the horizontal line y=b. DF goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0), so its direction vector is (-a,-b). The angle between FG (direction vector (-1,0)) and DF (direction vector (-a,-b)).

To find this angle β, we can use the dot product formula. The cosine of angle β is the dot product of the unit vectors in the directions of FG and DF.

Vector FG direction: from F to G is (-a, 0). Unit vector: (-1, 0).

Vector DF direction: from F to D is (-a, -b). Unit vector: (-a, -b)/sqrt(a² + b²).

Dot product between (-1,0) and (-a, -b)/sqrt(a² + b²) is [(-1)(-a) + 0*(-b)] / sqrt(a² + b²) = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

So cos(β) = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

But tan(α) = b/a, and tan(β) can be found from the slope of DF relative to FG. Alternatively, note that α and β are related via the triangle.

Alternatively, since in the rectangle, the diagonals are equal and split into two congruent triangles. Each triangle has legs of length a and b, hypotenuse sqrt(a² + b²).

In triangle D-E-F, which is a right triangle at E (since DE and EF are perpendicular), the angles at D and F would be complementary. Wait, no. Triangle DEF is not necessarily a right triangle. Wait, in the rectangle, DE and EF are perpendicular, so triangle DEF is a right triangle with right angle at E. So, in triangle DEF, angle at D is α, angle at E is 90°, and angle at F is gamma. So:

α + 90° + gamma = 180° → alpha + gamma = 90°.

Similarly, in triangle DFG, which is also a right triangle at G (since FG and GD are perpendicular). So, in triangle DFG, angle at F is beta, angle at G is 90°, and angle at D is delta. So:

beta + 90° + delta = 180° → beta + delta = 90°.

But how does this relate to alpha and beta?

From triangle DEF: alpha + gamma = 90°, and from triangle DFG: beta + delta = 90°.

However, without knowing more about the relationship between gamma and delta, this might not help directly.

But wait, since DF is the common diagonal, and the entire figure is a rectangle, there might be relations between these angles. For instance, gamma and delta might be related to other angles in the diagram.

Alternatively, notice that in the rectangle, the sum of angles alpha and beta could relate to something. Let me think differently.

Since DEFG is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, DF and EG are diagonals intersecting at point A. Given that, the angles at D and F might be related through the properties of the diagonals.

But returning to the earlier calculation using coordinates, where tan(alpha) = b/a, and cos(beta) = a/sqrt(a² + b²). Let me see if there's a relationship between alpha and beta.

Let me express beta in terms of alpha. From tan(alpha) = b/a → b = a tan(alpha).

Then, cos(beta) = a / sqrt(a² + b²) = a / sqrt(a² + a² tan² alpha) = a / [a sqrt(1 + tan² alpha)] ) = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan² alpha) = 1 / sec(alpha) = cos(alpha).

So, cos(beta) = cos(alpha) → beta = alpha or beta = -alpha. Since angles are between 0 and 180°, beta = alpha.

Wait, this suggests that alpha = beta. So, this contradicts the earlier same-side interior angles idea. What's going on here?

Ah, this is crucial. According to this coordinate-based analysis, alpha and beta are equal. Hence, my first reasoning was correct, and the second approach (same-side interior angles) was wrong. Why?

Because in reality, the angles alpha and beta are not same-side interior angles, but rather, they are equal because of the rectangle's properties. The error in the same-side interior angles reasoning was due to misidentifying the transversal's position relative to the parallel lines.

So, according to the coordinate analysis, alpha = beta. Hence, setting 5x-3 = 3x+7 leads to x=5, giving alpha = 22°, which is option A.

But why did the same-side interior angles reasoning suggest they sum to 180°? Probably because I incorrectly identified the angles as same-side interior, but in reality, they are alternate interior angles or something else. Wait, let me recheck.

With DE and FG parallel, and DF as a transversal, the angles at D and F are on different sides of the transversal. Wait, if DE is parallel to FG, and DF is a transversal crossing them, then the angles at D and F would be on opposite sides of DF, making them alternate interior angles, hence equal. Ah, that's the correct identification!

So, earlier confusion was due to incorrect visualization of the transversal's position. With DE and FG parallel, and DF crossing them, the angles α and β are alternate interior angles, thus equal. Hence, alpha = beta.

Thus, solving 5x-3 = 3x+7 gives x=5, leading to m∠EDF = 22°, which is option A. 

But earlier when I thought they were same-side interior angles, that led to inconsistency. So, the correct relationship is that alpha = beta, leading to x=5 and angle measure 22°, which is option A.

But why did the coordinate analysis show that alpha = beta? Because of the properties of the rectangle. Hence, the correct answer should be A. But wait, let me check again with x=5.

m∠EDF = 5x -3 = 5*5 -3 = 25 -3 = 22°, which is option A. The other angle, m∠DFG = 3x +7 = 15 +7=22°, so both angles are 22°, which makes sense as they are equal. 

But wait, in the rectangle, the diagonals split the angles at D and F into equal parts? Wait, but in a general rectangle, the diagonals don't necessarily split the angles into equal parts unless it's a square. Wait, but in this case, the angles are equal, implying that the rectangle is a square? Or not necessarily?

Wait, no. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they don't necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a square. So, if the angles at D and F are split into equal parts by the diagonal, that would imply that the rectangle is a square. But in this case, even though it's a general rectangle, we are told that the angles created by the diagonal are equal. So, this would imply that the rectangle is a square. But the problem doesn't specify that it's a square, just a rectangle. How is this possible?

Wait, but according to the equations, alpha = beta, which in a rectangle would require that the diagonal splits the angles into equal parts. This can only happen if the rectangle is a square. Otherwise, the angles would not be equal. So, this suggests that the rectangle must be a square. But the problem states it's a rectangle, not necessarily a square. So, is there a contradiction here?

Wait, no. Because the problem gives us that m∠EDF = 5x-3 and m∠DFG = 3x+7, and from the geometric constraints of the rectangle, these two angles must be equal. Hence, even though the rectangle isn't necessarily a square, the given conditions force the angles to be equal, leading to x=5. This is acceptable, even if it implies that the rectangle is a square. But since the problem allows for this possibility, it's valid.

Thus, the correct answer is A.22. But let me check again with the initial assumption that alpha = beta. If the rectangle is a square, then all angles are 90°, and the diagonal splits each 90° angle into two 45° angles. But in this case, the angles are 22°, which wouldn't fit a square. So, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Wait, this suggests that my earlier conclusion that alpha = beta is incorrect. There's a fundamental flaw in the logic. 

Let me re-express this. In a general rectangle, the diagonal does not bisect the angles. Only in a square does the diagonal bisect the angles. So, in a non-square rectangle, the angles created by the diagonal at each corner are not equal. Hence, alpha ≠ beta. Therefore, my earlier assumption that alpha = beta is wrong, leading to an invalid solution.

This means I need to revisit the problem. So, what's the correct relationship between alpha and beta?

Let me go back to the coordinate system. Let me define the rectangle with D at (0,0), E at (a,0), F at (a,b), G at (0,b). Diagonal DF goes from (0,0) to (a,b). Angle EDF is the angle between DE (along x-axis) and DF. As before, tan(alpha) = b/a. Angle DFG is the angle at F between DF and FG. FG is from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is along negative x-axis. DF goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0), which has slope (0- b)/(0-a) = b/a. So, the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and DF (slope b/a) is beta.

To calculate beta, we can consider the angle between the negative x-axis and the line DF. The slope of DF is b/a, so the angle that DF makes with the x-axis is arctan(b/a). But since DF is going from F(a,b) to D(0,0), it extends from F downwards to the left. The angle between the negative x-axis (FG direction) and DF is the angle between the negative x-axis and the line DF. This angle is equal to the complement of alpha? Or something else.

Let me think. The angle alpha is measured from the x-axis to DF. The angle beta is measured from the negative x-axis to DF. These two angles together form a straight line, so alpha + beta = 180° - 90° = 90°? No, wait. Let me visualize.

At point F, the line FG is along the negative x-axis. The line DF comes from F(a,b) to D(0,0), which has a slope of b/a. The angle between FG (negative x-axis) and DF is beta. The angle between DF and the negative x-axis is beta. Meanwhile, the angle alpha at D is between the positive x-axis and DF. So, the total angle between the positive x-axis and negative x-axis is 180°, and the sum of alpha and beta would be 180° minus the angle between DF and the y-axis or something else?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the coordinate system. The slope of DF is b/a. The angle alpha at D is between the positive x-axis and DF, so alpha = arctan(b/a). The angle beta at F is between the negative x-axis and DF. The direction of DF from F is towards the southwest, so the angle beta is measured from the negative x-axis to the line DF. This is equal to 180° minus the angle that DF makes with the positive x-axis. Wait, no. If the slope is b/a, then the angle between DF and the positive x-axis is alpha = arctan(b/a). The angle between DF and the negative x-axis is 180° - alpha. But beta is the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and DF, so beta = 180° - alpha. Wait, but that would mean alpha + beta = 180°, which brings us back to the earlier conflict.

But earlier, using the coordinate system, we had from the triangle analysis that alpha = beta. This contradiction suggests a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let's redo this carefully. At point D, the angle alpha is between DE (positive x-axis) and DF. The slope of DF is b/a, so alpha = arctan(b/a). At point F, the angle beta is between FG (negative x-axis) and DF. The direction of DF from F is towards D, which is southwest. The angle between the negative x-axis and DF can be calculated as follows: the slope of DF from F is (y change)/(x change). From F(a,b) to D(0,0), the x change is -a, y change is -b. So the slope is (-b)/(-a) = b/a. So, the angle beta is the angle between the negative x-axis and the line DF, which has slope b/a. To find beta, we can consider that the angle between the negative x-axis and DF is equal to the angle whose tangent is (opposite/adjacent). If we consider a right triangle from F, going along negative x-axis and upward, the slope b/a would correspond to rise over run. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, since the slope of DF is b/a, the angle between DF and the positive x-axis is alpha = arctan(b/a). The angle between DF and the negative x-axis would be 180° - alpha. But beta is the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and DF, which is 180° - alpha. Hence, beta = 180° - alpha. 

But this would mean alpha + beta = 180°, which contradicts the earlier coordinate analysis where we found alpha = beta. Clearly, there's a mistake here. 

Wait, in the coordinate analysis earlier, we used the dot product and found that cos(beta) = cos(alpha), suggesting beta = alpha. But according to this new calculation, beta = 180° - alpha. Which is correct?

Let me test with a concrete example. Let's say a rectangle with a=3, b=4. So, alpha = arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°. Beta would be the angle at F between FG (negative x-axis) and DF. The line DF has slope 4/3, but from point F, it goes to D(0,0). So, from F(a,b), the line DF goes downward to the left. The angle between the negative x-axis and DF would be the same as the angle between the negative x-axis and a line with slope 4/3. Wait, the slope is rise over run. From F, moving left (negative x) and down (negative y). So, the slope is (change in y)/(change in x) = (-4)/(-3) = 4/3. So, the angle between the negative x-axis and DF is the angle whose tangent is (opposite/adjacent). If we imagine a right triangle from F, going left 3 units and down 4 units, the angle at F would have tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = 4/3. So theta = arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°. Hence, beta = arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°, which is equal to alpha. Hence, alpha = beta.

But according to the previous reasoning, beta = 180° - alpha, which would give beta ≈ 126.87°, which contradicts this. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I see. When calculating beta, the angle between the negative x-axis and DF, we need to consider the actual direction. The slope is 4/3, but since it's going from F to D, which is left and down, the angle between the negative x-axis and DF is the acute angle, which is arctan(4/3), not the obtuse angle. Hence, beta = arctan(b/a) = alpha. Therefore, alpha = beta.

This resolves the contradiction. Hence, alpha = beta, and therefore, the equation 5x -3 = 3x +7 is correct, leading to x=5 and m∠EDF = 22°, which is option A. 

But why does this work even though the rectangle isn't a square? Because in a general rectangle, the diagonal creates equal angles at D and F, even though the rectangle is not a square. Wait, this seems contradictory to prior knowledge. Let me think again.

No, in a general rectangle, the diagonals are not angle bisectors. Only in a square are the diagonals angle bisectors. So, why in this case, the angles alpha and beta are equal? This suggests that the given conditions in the problem force the rectangle to be a square, but the problem only states it's a rectangle. This seems paradoxical.

Wait, but in this scenario, the given condition that m∠EDF = 5x-3 and m∠DFG = 3x+7, and from the geometric constraints, these angles must be equal. Hence, the problem implicitly assumes that alpha = beta, which would only be true if the rectangle is a square. But since the problem allows for this, it's acceptable. Even though in a general rectangle, alpha ≠ beta, the given conditions force alpha = beta, which implies that the rectangle must be a square. Hence, the solution proceeds.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.22. So the answer is A.
