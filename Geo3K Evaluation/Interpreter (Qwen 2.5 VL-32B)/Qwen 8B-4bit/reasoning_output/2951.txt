Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the figure they describe. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DA, BD. Also, there are some angles mentioned: Angle at BCA, CAD, and ADB. These angles are all right angles. Additionally, there are several triangles: BCA, CAD, ADB. And a rectangle CDA B. Wait, the rectangle is named as Rectangle(C,D,A,B). So that suggests that the figure is a rectangle with vertices C, D, A, B connected in order? Or maybe it's a quadrilateral formed by those four points?

Also, there are length equalities. For example, LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 10 units. LengthOf(Line(C,A)) is 8 units. LengthOf(Line(A,D)) is 4 units. Then there are perpendicularity conditions: BC is perpendicular to CA, CA is perpendicular to AD, and AD is perpendicular to BD. 

Additionally, there are statements about hypotenuses. Line AB is the hypotenuse of triangle ADB, and BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BCD. Also, there are equations involving squares of lengths. Like SquareOf(AB) equals SquareOf(BC) plus SquareOf(CA), which seems like Pythagoras' theorem. Similarly for other sides. 

Wait, so if we think about these right angles and the rectangles, perhaps the entire figure is made up of multiple right triangles connected together. Since there's a rectangle involved, maybe the figure is a combination of rectangles and right triangles.

Let me try to visualize the figure. Points A, B, C, D forming a rectangle? But since there's a Rectangle(C,D,A,B), that would mean that the rectangle has vertices C, D, A, B. So the sides would be CD, DA, AB, and BC? Wait, but the lines given are AB, BC, CD, DA, BD. So BD is a diagonal? Because in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. However, BD is also mentioned as part of triangle BCD, where it's the hypotenuse.

But first, let's note the lengths. Given that BC = 10, CA = 8, AD = 4. Also, since CA is perpendicular to AD, and AD is perpendicular to BD, so CA is perpendicular to AD, and AD is perpendicular to BD, implying that BD is parallel to CA? Wait, because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, CA is perpendicular to AD, and AD is perpendicular to BD. Therefore, BD is parallel to CA? Wait, no. If AD is perpendicular to both CA and BD, then BD and CA are both perpendicular to AD, hence BD is parallel to CA. That makes sense.

So, since CA is perpendicular to AD, and BD is perpendicular to AD, then BD || CA. So BD is parallel to CA. Now, considering the rectangle CDA B. Wait, if CDA B is a rectangle, then opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So CD should be equal to AB, and DA equal to BC. Wait, but according to the given lengths, BC is 10, DA is 4. But if CD is supposed to be equal to AB, and DA equal to BC? Wait, maybe my understanding of the rectangle is off.

Alternatively, the rectangle could be C, D, A, B arranged such that CD and AB are opposite sides, and DA and CB are opposite sides. Wait, but if the rectangle is C-D-A-B-C, then sides CD, DA, AB, BC. Wait, but then DA is one side, BC another. But given that DA is 4, BC is 10, which would imply that DA ≠ BC unless the rectangle is not a rectangle. Hmm, contradiction here. Maybe the rectangle isn't C-D-A-B, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is C-D-A-B connected in order, making CD, DA, AB, and BC as its sides. But then CD would be adjacent to DA, which is adjacent to AB, etc. But in that case, DA is 4, BC is 10. Which would make DA and BC unequal, contradicting the property of a rectangle having opposite sides equal. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the rectangle is not C-D-A-B in that order. Wait, maybe the rectangle is actually C, A, D, B? Let me check the rectangle predicate again: Rectangle(C,D,A,B). In standard notation, a rectangle is defined by its vertices in order, so the sides would be CD, DA, AB, and BC. Wait, but then DA and BC would be opposite sides. But DA is given as 4, BC is 10, so they wouldn't be equal. Contradiction. Hence, perhaps the rectangle is not C-D-A-B, but another arrangement. Maybe the rectangle is C, A, B, D? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is C, D, A, B arranged such that CD and AB are horizontal sides, and DA and CB are vertical. But given that DA is 4 and BC is 10, that would require DA and BC to be equal for a rectangle. But here DA=4 and BC=10, so they aren't equal. So something's wrong here. Perhaps the rectangle is not referring to the full figure, but just parts of it? Or maybe the rectangle is C, D, A, and another point? Wait, the rectangle is specified as Rectangle(C,D,A,B), which implies four points. So the rectangle is made of points C, D, A, B. So the sides would be CD, DA, AB, and BC. Wait, but DA is 4 and BC is 10. Unless DA and BC are not sides of the rectangle but diagonals? No, in a rectangle, the sides are the edges. So this seems conflicting. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not a simple rectangle but includes diagonals? Wait, no. Rectangles have four sides. Let me check the given lines again. The lines are AB, BC, CD, DA, BD. So BD is a diagonal. So perhaps the rectangle is C, D, A, and another point? Wait, the rectangle is C, D, A, B. So the sides would be CD, DA, AB, and BC. But again, DA and BC are different lengths. This seems contradictory. However, the problem states that there is a Rectangle(C,D,A,B). So regardless of the lengths, it's given as a rectangle. Therefore, even though DA and BC have different lengths, the given data must satisfy that. So perhaps there's more to the figure than just the rectangle. Maybe the rectangle is combined with other elements?

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle refers to CDA and B as part of the rectangle? Not sure. Let me try another approach.

Given that there are right angles at BCA, CAD, and ADB. Let me consider the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let's assume coordinate system.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Since CA is 8 units and CA is perpendicular to AD. Suppose CA is along the x-axis. So point C is at (0,0), and point A is at (8,0) because CA = 8. Then AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD is vertical. Since AD is 4 units, point D would be at (8,4). Wait, but then DA is from D(8,4) to A(8,0), which is 4 units long. That works. Now, BD is a line from B to D(8,4). Also, there's a line BC, which is 10 units. Since point B is connected to C(0,0), and BC is 10 units. Also, angle at BCA is a right angle, which would be angle at C between BC and CA. So since CA is along the x-axis from C(0,0) to A(8,0), and BC is from C(0,0) to B. Since angle at C is a right angle, BC must be perpendicular to CA. Since CA is horizontal, BC must be vertical. Therefore, point B is somewhere along the y-axis. Wait, but if BC is perpendicular to CA, then BC is vertical. So if C is at (0,0), then point B is at (0, y) for some y. The length BC is 10, so distance from C(0,0) to B(0,y) is |y| = 10, so y = 10 or -10. Let's take y positive, so B is at (0,10).

Now, we have points:

C: (0,0)

A: (8,0)

D: (8,4)

B: (0,10)

Now, check other conditions. There's a line BD connecting B(0,10) to D(8,4). Let's compute the length of BD. Using distance formula: sqrt((8-0)^2 + (4-10)^2) = sqrt(64 + 36) = sqrt(100) = 10. Wait, but earlier, we had that BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BCD. Wait, but in our current setup, BD is length 10. Let me check the given predicates. One of the equalities was Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,D))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A))))). Let me verify that. 

First, compute SquareOf(LengthOf(BD)): 10^2 = 100.

SquareOf(CD): CD is from C(0,0) to D(8,4). Wait, wait, hold on. Earlier, I assumed D is at (8,4), but CD is a line. Let me check the length of CD. From C(0,0) to D(8,4): sqrt((8)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(64+16)=sqrt(80)=4√5. Then SquareOf(CD) is 80. SquareOf(CA) is 8^2=64. Adding them gives 80+64=144. Which equals 12^2. But according to the predicate, SquareOf(BD) should equal SquareOf(CD)+SquareOf(CA). Here, SquareOf(BD) is 100, which does not equal 144. So there's inconsistency here. Therefore, my assumption of coordinates is incorrect.

Hmm. Where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine the given equations. The last equality says Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,D))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A))))). So SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA). Given that SquareOf(CA) is 8^2 = 64. Therefore, SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + 64. Also, we know that SquareOf(BD) is equal to SquareOf(LengthOf(BD)). 

Earlier, when I placed D at (8,4), BD length squared was 10^2=100. So SquareOf(CD) must be 100 - 64 = 36. Thus, CD length squared is 36 → CD length is 6. But in my previous assumption, CD length was sqrt(8² +4²)=sqrt(80), which squared is 80. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, my initial coordinate assignment is wrong.

Therefore, I need to adjust the coordinates. Let me try again. Let me start over.

Given that CA is 8 units, and AD is 4 units, with CA perpendicular to AD. So, if I place point C at (0,0), point A at (8,0). Then AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD is vertical. Since AD is 4 units, point D is either (8,4) or (8,-4). Let's choose (8,4) for simplicity. Now, CD is from C(0,0) to D(8,4). The length of CD is sqrt(8² +4²)=sqrt(80)=4√5. Then SquareOf(CD) is 80. According to the equation, SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA) → SquareOf(BD) = 80 + 64 = 144 → BD = 12. 

But BD connects point B to D(8,4). We need to find coordinates of B such that BD = 12. Also, BC is 10 units. Since BC is perpendicular to CA. CA is horizontal from C(0,0) to A(8,0), so BC is vertical. So point B lies along the vertical line passing through C(0,0). So B is at (0, y). Distance from C(0,0) to B(0,y) is |y|=10 → y=10 or -10. Let's pick y=10, so B is (0,10). Now, compute BD: from B(0,10) to D(8,4). The distance squared is (8-0)^2 + (4-10)^2 = 64 + 36 = 100. So BD squared is 100, but according to the equation it should be 144. So discrepancy here. Therefore, this coordinate assignment is invalid.

This suggests that my assumption about the position of D is wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe AD is not vertical. Wait, since CA is horizontal, AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD must be vertical. Therefore, D must lie directly above or below A. So if A is at (8,0), then D is at (8, k), where k is some value. Let me denote D as (8, k). Then AD length is |k - 0| = |k|. Given that AD is 4, so k = ±4. Let's take k=4, so D is (8,4). Then CD is from C(0,0) to D(8,4), length sqrt(8² +4²)=sqrt(80). As before. Then SquareOf(CD) is 80. SquareOf(BD) should be 80 + 64 = 144 → BD = 12. But BD is from B(0,10) to D(8,4), which squared distance is 8² + (-6)^2 = 64 + 36 = 100. So BD squared is 100, not 144. Therefore, inconsistency.

So maybe my assumption about the position of B is wrong? Wait, but BC is perpendicular to CA. CA is horizontal, so BC must be vertical. So point B is along the vertical line through C(0,0). So B is (0, y). So BC length is |y|. Given that BC is 10, so y=±10. So B is (0,10) or (0,-10). Let's suppose B is (0,10). Then BD is from (0,10) to (8,4). As before, BD squared is 100. But according to the equation, it should be 144. Therefore, there's a conflict here. What's wrong?

Looking back at the given equations: Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,D))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A))))). So SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA). Which means that BD² = CD² + CA². Which resembles the Pythagorean theorem. So this suggests that triangle CBD is a right triangle, with right angle at C. But wait, in our setup, point C is connected to B and D. If angle at C is a right angle, then yes, triangle CBD would be a right triangle with legs CB and CD, and hypotenuse BD. But according to the given, the right angles are at BCA, CAD, and ADB. Wait, angle at BCA is right, which is angle at C between B, C, A. So that's angle BCA, which is right. So in triangle BCA, which is a right triangle with right angle at C. So BC and CA are legs, and BA is hypotenuse. Then BA² = BC² + CA². Which is given as Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(A,B))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A))))) → which is consistent with Pythagoras. So BA² = 10² + 8² = 100 + 64 = 164 → BA = sqrt(164). 

But in our coordinate system, BA is from B(0,10) to A(8,0). Distance squared is (8-0)^2 + (0-10)^2 = 64 + 100 = 164. Correct. So that's fine. 

Now, the other equation is SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA). Which would mean BD² = CD² + CA². So that would suggest that triangle CBD is a right triangle with right angle at C. So angle at C between B, C, D is right. But in the given predicates, we have RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C between B, C, A. So that's already accounted for. Are there any other right angles at C? The other right angles are at CAD and ADB. So angle at A between C, A, D is right. And angle at D between A, D, B is right. So in our current setup, we have three right angles: at C (angle BCA), at A (angle CAD), and at D (angle ADB). 

But in the given, there's also the statement that Angle(C,A,D) is a right angle. So angle at A between C, A, D. Which is angle CAD. So that's a right angle. Which in our coordinate system, since CA is horizontal from C(0,0) to A(8,0), and AD is vertical from A(8,0) to D(8,4). So angle at A between CA and AD is indeed a right angle. So that checks out. 

Then the third right angle is Angle(A,D,B), which is angle at D between A, D, B. So angle ADB is a right angle. So in our coordinates, point D is at (8,4), and points A(8,0), D(8,4), B(0,10). So angle at D between A, D, B. Let me check if that's a right angle. The vectors DA and DB. DA is from D to A: (8-8, 0-4) = (0, -4). DB is from D to B: (0-8, 10-4) = (-8, 6). The dot product of DA and DB is (0)(-8) + (-4)(6) = -24. Which is not zero. Therefore, angle at D is not a right angle. So this contradicts the given RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)). 

Ah, so there's a problem here. My coordinate assumption leads to angle at D not being a right angle. Therefore, my coordinate system is missing something. How to resolve this?

Maybe the position of D is not (8,4)? Wait, AD is given as 4 units. So if CA is 8 units, and AD is 4 units, and they're perpendicular, then AD must be a vertical segment of length 4. So from A(8,0), moving up or down 4 units. But in that case, D would be (8,4) or (8,-4). Let me try D at (8, -4). Then AD is from A(8,0) to D(8,-4), length 4. Then CD is from C(0,0) to D(8,-4). Length squared is 8² + (-4)^2 = 64 + 16 = 80. So SquareOf(CD) is 80. Then SquareOf(BD) should be 80 + 64 = 144 → BD = 12. 

Let me calculate BD with D at (8,-4). Point B is still at (0,10). So BD is from (0,10) to (8,-4). Distance squared is (8-0)^2 + (-4 - 10)^2 = 64 + (-14)^2 = 64 + 196 = 260. Which is not 144. Still inconsistent. 

Hmm. So what's wrong here? The problem arises because the equation SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA) is given, but in our setup, this doesn't hold. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misassumption. 

Wait, maybe the right angle at D is not between A, D, B, but another configuration? Let me recheck the given predicates. The right angles are:

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) – angle at C between B, C, A.

RightAngle(Angle(C,A,D)) – angle at A between C, A, D.

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)) – angle at D between A, D, B.

So angle at D between A, D, B must be a right angle. So vectors DA and DB must be perpendicular. 

In our current setup, DA vector is from D to A: (A.x - D.x, A.y - D.y). If D is at (8,4), then DA is (8-8, 0-4) = (0, -4). DB is from D(8,4) to B(0,10): (0-8, 10-4) = (-8, 6). Dot product is (0)(-8) + (-4)(6) = -24 ≠ 0. Not perpendicular. So angle at D is not right. 

To make DA and DB perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So DA · DB = 0. 

Let me define variables. Let me assign coordinates again, but this time ensuring that DA · DB = 0. 

Let me set C at (0,0), A at (8,0). AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD is vertical. So D is at (8, y), with AD length |y| = 4 → y = ±4. Let's take D as (8,4) for now. 

Then DA vector is from D to A: (8-8, 0-4) = (0, -4). 

Point B is at (0, b), since BC is vertical (perpendicular to CA). BC length is 10, so b = ±10. Let's take b = 10, so B is (0,10). 

Vector DB is from D(8,4) to B(0,10): (-8, 6). 

Dot product of DA and DB: (0)(-8) + (-4)(6) = -24 ≠ 0. Not perpendicular. 

To make DA · DB = 0, we need (0)(x) + (-4)(y) = 0 → -4y = 0 → y = 0. But y is the y-coordinate of D, which is 4. So impossible. Hence, with D at (8,4), it's impossible to have angle at D being right. 

What if D is at (8,-4)? Then DA vector is (0, 4). Vector DB is from D(8,-4) to B(0,10): (-8, 14). Dot product is (0)(-8) + (4)(14) = 56 ≠ 0. Still not zero. 

Thus, this suggests that my initial assumption that AD is vertical may be incorrect. Wait, but CA is horizontal, and AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD must be vertical. So why is there a contradiction? 

Perhaps the error is in assuming that point B is along the vertical line through C. Wait, the condition is that BC is perpendicular to CA. CA is horizontal, so BC must be vertical. Yes. So point B must be along the vertical line through C. 

But if that's true, then the dot product condition for angle at D cannot be satisfied. This suggests that there is an inconsistency in the given predicates, which is unlikely. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, perhaps the line BD is not from B to D, but another configuration? Or maybe the rectangle involves other points? Let me revisit the rectangle predicate: Rectangle(C,D,A,B). So the rectangle has vertices C, D, A, B. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So CD ⊥ DA, DA ⊥ AB, AB ⊥ BC, and BC ⊥ CD. But we already have DA ⊥ CA, and BC ⊥ CA. Wait, CA is part of AB? No. Wait, AB is a line from A to B. In our current setup, AB goes from A(8,0) to B(0,10). Is AB perpendicular to anything? Not necessarily. 

Wait, but there's also the condition that Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,D)). So AD is perpendicular to BD. AD is from A to D, and BD is from B to D. So vectors AD and BD are perpendicular. 

AD vector is from A to D: (8,4) - (8,0) = (0,4). BD vector is from B to D: (8,4) - (0,10) = (8, -6). Their dot product is (0)(8) + (4)(-6) = -24 ≠ 0. So not perpendicular. Which contradicts the given Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,D)). 

Ah! Here's the issue. The given condition is Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,D)), which means AD ⊥ BD. But in our setup, they are not perpendicular. So this indicates that my coordinate assignments are incorrect. 

So how to ensure that AD is perpendicular to BD? Let me redefine the coordinates with this condition. 

Let me denote:

Let’s define point C at (0,0), point A at (a,0), since CA is a horizontal line. AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD is vertical. So D is at (a, d), where d is the y-coordinate. Given that AD length is 4, so |d| = 4 → d = 4 or -4. Let's say d = 4, so D is (a,4). 

Point B is somewhere such that BC is perpendicular to CA, so BC is vertical. So B is at (0, b), since it's on the vertical line through C(0,0). Given that BC length is 10, so |b| = 10 → b = 10 or -10. Let's take b = 10, so B is (0,10). 

Now, we need AD ⊥ BD. Vector AD is from A(a,0) to D(a,4): (0,4). Vector BD is from B(0,10) to D(a,4): (a-0, 4-10) = (a, -6). For AD and BD to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. 

AD • BD = (0)(a) + (4)(-6) = -24 = 0? No, -24 ≠ 0. So this is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that AD is vertical is incorrect. Wait, but CA is horizontal, and AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD must be vertical. So this suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, or my understanding of it. 

Wait, perhaps CA is not horizontal? Maybe I assigned the direction incorrectly. Let me try a different approach. Let me use variables instead of fixed coordinates.

Let me denote:

Let’s suppose that CA is a horizontal line segment of length 8, with C at (0,0) and A at (8,0). AD is perpendicular to CA, so AD is vertical. So D is at (8, y), with AD length |y| = 4 → y = ±4. Let's take y = 4, so D is (8,4). 

Now, BC is perpendicular to CA, so BC is vertical. So B is at (0, b), with BC length 10 → |b| = 10 → b = 10 or -10. Take b = 10, so B is (0,10). 

Now, we need AD ⊥ BD. Vector AD is from A(8,0) to D(8,4): (0,4). Vector BD is from B(0,10) to D(8,4): (8, -6). Their dot product is 0*8 + 4*(-6) = -24 ≠ 0. Not perpendicular. 

To satisfy AD ⊥ BD, we need the dot product to be zero. So 0*x + 4*y = 0, where x and y are components of BD. Wait, BD vector is (8, -6). So the dot product is 0*8 + 4*(-6) = -24. To make this zero, we need to change the vector BD. How? By changing the position of D or B?

Wait, perhaps D is not vertically aligned with A? But AD is perpendicular to CA, which is horizontal, so AD must be vertical. So D must be directly above or below A. So this seems unavoidable. Hence, the problem is unsolvable under these constraints? Or am I missing something? 

Wait, let's look at the other given condition: Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,D)). So AD and BD are perpendicular. So the slope of AD multiplied by the slope of BD must be -1. 

Slope of AD: since AD is vertical (from A(8,0) to D(8,4)), its slope is undefined (infinite). So a vertical line. For BD to be perpendicular to AD, BD must be horizontal. Because a vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line. So BD must be horizontal. 

But BD is from B(0,10) to D(8,4). For this line to be horizontal, the y-coordinates of B and D must be equal. But D is at (8,4) and B is at (0,10), so their y-coordinates are 4 and 10, which are not equal. Hence, BD is not horizontal. Hence, AD and BD are not perpendicular. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given conditions. But since the problem is solvable, there must be a different way to interpret the setup. 

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is not C-D-A-B but another configuration? Let me reconsider the rectangle. The rectangle is Rectangle(C,D,A,B). In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and all angles are right. So if the rectangle is C-D-A-B, then sides CD and AB are equal, DA and CB are equal. But from the given lengths, DA is 4, CB is 10. So this would require 4 = 10, which is false. Hence, the rectangle must be C-A-D-B? Let me check. If the rectangle is C-A-D-B, then sides CA, AD, DB, BC. CA is 8, AD is 4, DB is ?, BC is 10. For it to be a rectangle, CA must equal DB, and AD must equal BC. So CA = DB → 8 = DB. AD = BC → 4 = 10? No. Again contradiction. 

Alternatively, the rectangle could be C-D-B-A? Let me see. Sides CD, DB, BA, AC. CD and BA would be equal, DB and AC equal. CD is from C to D, BA is from B to A. DB is from D to B, AC is from A to C. Given that AC is 8, so DB should be 8. Also, CD and BA should be equal. BA is from B to A, which in our previous setup is sqrt( (8-0)^2 + (0-10)^2 ) = sqrt(164). So CD should be equal to BA, which is sqrt(164). But CD is from C(0,0) to D(8,4), which is sqrt(80). Not equal. So again contradiction. 

This suggests that the rectangle is not a standard rectangle, or there's a misunderstanding in the way the rectangle is defined. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not a parallelogram but includes diagonals? No, rectangles are parallelograms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not referring to the full figure but to part of it? Or maybe it's a typo, and should be a different shape? 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not C-D-A-B but C-B-A-D? Let me try that. If the rectangle is C-B-A-D, then sides CB, BA, AD, DC. CB is 10, BA is sqrt(164), AD is 4, DC is sqrt(80). Again, not matching. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on the equations given. 

We have:

1. SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA) → BD² = CD² + 64.

2. Also, from the other equation, SquareOf(AB) = SquareOf(BC) + SquareOf(CA) → AB² = 100 + 64 = 164 → AB = sqrt(164).

From the given, IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,D,B)) → AB is the hypotenuse of triangle ADB. In triangle ADB, right-angled at D. Wait, because Angle(A,D,B) is a right angle. So triangle ADB is right-angled at D. Hence, AB² = AD² + BD². 

Wait, this is crucial! Let me write this down. 

Since Angle(A,D,B) is a right angle, triangle ADB is right-angled at D. So by Pythagoras: AB² = AD² + BD².

But we also have from the given equation: SquareOf(AB) = Add(SquareOf(AD), SquareOf(BD))? No, the given equation is SquareOf(AB) = Add(SquareOf(BC), SquareOf(CA)), which is 10² + 8² = 164. 

But from the right triangle ADB, AB² = AD² + BD² → 164 = 4² + BD² → 164 = 16 + BD² → BD² = 148 → BD = sqrt(148). 

But from the other equation, SquareOf(BD) = SquareOf(CD) + SquareOf(CA) → BD² = CD² + 64 → 148 = CD² + 64 → CD² = 84 → CD = sqrt(84). 

Now, let's check if this is consistent with other given conditions. 

Also, from the rectangle CDA B, which is a rectangle. So in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So CD should equal AB, and DA should equal BC. 

Wait, if CD is sqrt(84) and AB is sqrt(164), they are not equal. So this suggests that the rectangle CDA B is not a standard rectangle, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

But the problem states that Rectangle(C,D,A,B) exists. So this suggests that my earlier conclusion about the right triangle is wrong. Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

The given predicates state:

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)) → angle at D between A, D, B is right. So triangle ADB is right-angled at D. Hence, AB² = AD² + BD². 

But also, from the given equation: Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,D))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A))))) → BD² = CD² + CA². 

So combining these two:

From triangle ADB: AB² = AD² + BD² → 164 = 16 + BD² → BD² = 148.

From the equation: BD² = CD² + 64 → 148 = CD² + 64 → CD² = 84 → CD = sqrt(84).

Now, if the figure is a rectangle CDA B, then CD should equal AB, and DA should equal BC. 

But AB is sqrt(164), CD is sqrt(84), so they are not equal. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that the rectangle is not CDA B, but perhaps another configuration. Or perhaps the rectangle is C, D, A, and another point? Or maybe the rectangle is C, A, D, B? Let me check. If it's a rectangle C, A, D, B, then sides CA, AD, DB, BC. 

CA is 8, AD is 4, DB is sqrt(148), BC is 10. For it to be a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal. So CA should equal DB, and AD should equal BC. But 8 vs sqrt(148) ≈ 12.166, and 4 vs 10. Not equal. Hence, contradiction. 

This indicates that there's a fundamental inconsistency, but since the problem is given, I must have made an error. Let me try to find another approach. 

Let me list all the given lengths and relations:

- BC = 10
- CA = 8
- AD = 4
- BD is such that BD² = CD² + CA² = CD² + 64
- AB is such that AB² = BC² + CA² = 100 + 64 = 164 → AB = √164
- From triangle ADB, right-angled at D: AB² = AD² + BD² → 164 = 16 + BD² → BD² = 148 → BD = √148
- Hence, from the equation BD² = CD² + 64 → 148 = CD² + 64 → CD² = 84 → CD = √84

Now, let's try to find the perimeter of the figure. The figure consists of points A, B, C, D connected by lines AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. So the perimeter would be the sum of the lengths of all the outer edges. But what is the figure? It's a quadrilateral with diagonals? Or a pentagon? Wait, the lines are AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. So it's a quadrilateral ABCD with a diagonal BD. So the perimeter would be AB + BC + CD + DA. Because the perimeter of the figure is the total length around the outer edge, which would be AB + BC + CD + DA. But let me confirm. 

Assuming the figure is a quadrilateral ABCD with sides AB, BC, CD, DA, and diagonal BD. So the perimeter would be AB + BC + CD + DA. 

Given that:

AB = √164

BC = 10

CD = √84

DA = 4

So total perimeter is √164 + 10 + √84 + 4. Let's compute this numerically.

But the answer choices are integers: 22, 32, 40, 42. So likely, the perimeter is an integer. Hence, my calculation must be wrong. 

Wait, but maybe the figure is a polygon with all the sides, including the diagonals? Or perhaps it's a combination of shapes. Let me think. 

Alternatively, the figure is a composite of the rectangle and the triangles. But since the rectangle is given as CDA B, which we've tried to analyze but found contradictions, maybe the perimeter is AB + BC + CD + DA + BD? But that would include the diagonal BD. But usually, perimeter refers to the outer boundary. If the figure is the union of the rectangle and the triangles, it might include all outer sides. 

Alternatively, let's think of the figure as the rectangle CDA B, but since it's a rectangle, the perimeter would be 2*(CD + DA). But CD is √84 and DA is 4, so 2*(√84 + 4). But this is not an integer, and not among the options. 

Alternatively, the perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the figure, including AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. So total perimeter would be AB + BC + CD + DA + BD. Let's calculate this:

AB = √164 = √(4*41) = 2√41 ≈ 12.8

BC = 10

CD = √84 = 2√21 ≈ 9.165

DA = 4

BD = √148 = 2√37 ≈ 12.166

Total ≈ 12.8 + 10 + 9.165 + 4 + 12.166 ≈ 48.13, which is not among the options. 

This suggests that my approach is incorrect. Let me try another way. 

Wait, maybe the perimeter is the sum of AB + BC + CD + DA, ignoring BD. Let's calculate that: 

AB = √164 ≈ 12.8

BC = 10

CD = √84 ≈ 9.165

DA = 4

Total ≈ 12.8 + 10 + 9.165 + 4 ≈ 35.96, which is close to 36, but not in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating AB. Let me re-express AB. 

From the given, AB is the hypotenuse of triangle ADB, which is right-angled at D. So AB² = AD² + BD² = 16 + 148 = 164 → AB = √164. 

But also, from the other equation, AB² = BC² + CA² = 100 + 64 = 164, which is consistent. 

So AB is correct. 

But how to get an integer perimeter? Let me think about the possibility that CD is 6, not √84. Let me re-examine the equation BD² = CD² + CA². 

If BD² = 148, and CA² = 64, then CD² = 148 - 64 = 84. So CD = √84. 

But if there's a mistake in the problem, or if I missed a relation, perhaps CD is 6? Let me check. 

If CD is 6, then BD² = 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100 → BD = 10. 

Then, from triangle ADB, AB² = AD² + BD² = 16 + 100 = 116 → AB = √116. 

But from the other equation, AB² should be BC² + CA² = 100 + 64 = 164. So 116 ≠ 164. Contradiction. 

Alternatively, if CD is 8, then BD² = 8² + 8² = 128 → BD = 8√2. Then AB² = 16 + 128 = 144 → AB = 12. 

Then, from the other equation, AB² should be 164. 144 ≠ 164. Still no good. 

Wait, what if CD is 6 and CA is 8, then BD² = 36 + 64 = 100 → BD = 10. Then, in triangle ADB, AB² = AD² + BD² = 16 + 100 = 116. But from the other equation, AB² = BC² + CA² = 100 + 64 = 164. So 116 ≠ 164. 

Nope. 

Alternatively, what if CD is 8? Then BD² = 64 + 64 = 128 → BD = 8√2. Then AB² = 16 + 128 = 144 → AB = 12. But this contradicts the other equation. 

This suggests that there's no way to make all equations consistent unless there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me re-examine the given equations. 

The given equations are:

Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,D))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,A)))))

Which is BD² = CD² + CA².

And from the right triangle ADB: AB² = AD² +
