MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have a triangle ABC. The points A, B, and C are defined, and there are lines connecting each pair: AB, BC, and AC. Also, there's an angle at point B, specifically Angle(A,B,C). Then there's a RightAngle predicate for that same angle, so that means angle B is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at B.

Next, the problem mentions that Line(A,C) is the hypotenuse of the triangle. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which would be AC here since the right angle is at B. That makes sense because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So, sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse.

Now, looking at the lengths: LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 13, LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 22, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is x, which is what we need to find. Wait, but if AC is the hypotenuse, then according to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the legs should equal the square of the hypotenuse. Let me write that down.

Let me recall the Pythagorean theorem: For a right-angled triangle with legs a and b, and hypotenuse c, we have a² + b² = c². Here, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Given that AB is 13, BC is x, and AC is 22. Plugging into the formula: 13² + x² = 22².

Calculating that, 13 squared is 169, and 22 squared is 484. So, substituting, we get 169 + x² = 484. To solve for x², subtract 169 from both sides: x² = 484 - 169. Let me compute that. 484 minus 160 is 324, and then minus 9 more is 315. So x² equals 315. Taking the square root of both sides gives x equals sqrt(315).

Wait, but sqrt(315) can be simplified. Let me factor 315. Breaking it down: 315 divided by 5 is 63. So 315 = 5*63. Then 63 is 9*7. So overall, 315 = 5*9*7. Therefore, sqrt(315) = sqrt(9*35) = 3*sqrt(35). So x is 3√35.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 3√35. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. 

First, confirming that the right angle is at B because of the RightAngle predicate on Angle(A,B,C). Then identifying the hypotenuse as AC, which is given by IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(...)). Then applying Pythagoras correctly. The lengths given are AB=13, AC=22, so BC=x. Calculations: 13² + x² = 22² → 169 + x² = 484 → x²=315 → x=√315=3√35. Yes, that seems right. 

Answer choice C is indeed 3√35, so the correct answer is C.
