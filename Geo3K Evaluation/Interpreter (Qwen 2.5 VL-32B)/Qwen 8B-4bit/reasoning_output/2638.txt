Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates and see what they tell us.

We have points J, K, L, M, N. There are several lines mentioned: Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(L,N), Line(N,M), Line(M,L), Line(L,J), Line(K,N). So, connecting these points in various ways. Then there are two triangles: Triangle(K,L,N) and Triangle(L,M,N). Both are isosceles. Also, some angles are given: Angle(J,K,L) measures 18 degrees, Angle(K,L,N) is 25 degrees, Angle(L,N,M) is 20 degrees, and Angle(J,K,N) is 130 degrees. Additionally, there are congruences: Line(K,L) congruent to Line(L,N), so KL ≅ LN, and Line(L,M) congruent to Line(M,N), so LM ≅ MN. Also, RightAngle at Angle(L,K,N), meaning that angle at K in triangle KLN is a right angle? Wait, wait. Let me clarify that.

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) means that angle at point K between points L and N is a right angle. So angle LKN is 90 degrees. But looking at the given angles, we also have Angle(K,L,N) which is 25 degrees. Wait, but if angle LKN is a right angle (90°), then maybe there's a contradiction here? Because in triangle KLN, if angle at K is 90°, then angle at L would be... Wait, let me check.

First, let's note down all the given angles:

- Measure of Angle(J,K,L) is 18°. That's angle at K between points J and L.
- Measure of Angle(K,L,N) is 25°. That's angle at L between points K and N.
- Measure of Angle(L,N,M) is 20°. That's angle at N between points L and M.
- Measure of Angle(J,K,N) is 130°. That's angle at K between points J and N.

Also, since triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles. Given that KL ≅ LN (from Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N))), so triangle KLN has sides KL = LN. Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle with base KN and equal sides KL and LN. Similarly, triangle LMN has LM ≅ MN (Congruent(Line(L,M), Line(M,N))), making it isosceles with base LN and equal sides LM and MN.

But wait, triangle LMN has sides LM and MN equal. So vertex at M?

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points K, L, N form triangle KLN, which is isosceles with KL = LN. So vertices K, L, N. Since KL = LN, the base is KN, and the two equal sides are KL and LN. Therefore, the base angles at K and N should be equal. Wait, but in triangle KLN, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Wait, KL and LN are the legs, so the angles opposite them would be angles at N and K respectively. Wait, no. In triangle KLN, side KL is opposite angle N, and side LN is opposite angle K. Wait, confusion here. Let me recall: in triangle ABC, side a is BC, opposite angle A; side b is AC, opposite angle B; side c is AB, opposite angle C.

So in triangle KLN, the sides are:

- KL: connects K and L, so opposite angle N.
- LN: connects L and N, so opposite angle K.
- NK: connects N and K, so opposite angle L.

Since KL ≅ LN, that means the sides opposite angles N and K are equal. Therefore, angles at N and K are equal. Wait, but earlier we have angle at L (which is angle KLN) is 25°, according to the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,N)) is 25°. Wait, Angle(K,L,N) refers to angle at L between points K and N, so that's angle KLN, which is 25°. So in triangle KLN, angles at K and N are equal. Let me denote angles:

In triangle KLN:

- angle at K: let's call it ∠K (which is angle LKN?) Wait, the angle at K is part of the triangle. Wait, the given Angle(K,L,N) is angle at L. Wait, the notation Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(K,L,N) is the angle at L between K and N, i.e., ∠KLN = 25°. 

Given that triangle KLN is isosceles with KL = LN, so sides KL and LN are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite those sides are equal. The side KL is opposite angle N (∠N), and side LN is opposite angle K (∠K). Therefore, ∠N = ∠K. 

But we know that ∠KLN (at L) is 25°, so sum of angles in triangle is 180°. So:

∠K + ∠L + ∠N = 180°
But ∠K = ∠N, and ∠L = 25°, so:

2∠K + 25° = 180° → 2∠K = 155° → ∠K = 77.5°, same for ∠N.

Wait, but hold on. Earlier, there was a predicate saying RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)). Which is angle at K between points L and N, so that's ∠LKN, which is the angle at K in triangle KLN. Wait, but according to our calculation above, ∠K (angle at K) is 77.5°, but the RightAngle says that ∠LKN is 90°, which contradicts unless my previous conclusion is wrong.

This suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-examine.

The RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) means that angle at K between L and N is a right angle. So ∠LKN is 90°. However, in triangle KLN, this angle is at K, so ∠K is 90°, which would mean that the triangle KLN has a right angle at K, making it a right isosceles triangle? But KL = LN, which would make the other angles equal. Wait, but in a right isosceles triangle, the two non-right angles are 45° each. But according to the given, angle at L (∠KLN) is 25°, which conflicts with that.

Hmm, this inconsistency suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which sides are equal is incorrect. Let me re-examine the congruence predicates.

The given Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)) implies that KL ≅ LN. So in triangle KLN, sides KL and LN are congruent. Therefore, the triangle is isosceles with legs KL and LN, so the base is KN, and the two equal sides are KL and LN. Thus, the base angles at K and N are equal. But if angle at K (∠LKN) is a right angle (due to RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N))), then that would imply that the triangle has a right angle at K, and the other angles are equal. Let me recalculate.

In triangle KLN, angles:

- ∠K (at K): 90° (given as right angle)
- ∠L (at L): 25° (given)
- ∠N (at N): ?

Sum of angles: 90 + 25 + ∠N = 180 → ∠N = 65°.

But since KL ≅ LN, the angles opposite them are equal. Wait, KL is opposite ∠N, and LN is opposite ∠K. So if KL ≅ LN, then ∠N ≅ ∠K. But according to this, ∠K is 90°, ∠N would be 65°, which are not equal. Contradiction again. So something's wrong here.

Ah! Here's the mistake: KL ≅ LN means that the sides KL and LN are equal, so in triangle KLN, the sides KL and LN are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite those sides are equal. The side KL is opposite angle N, and the side LN is opposite angle K. Therefore, ∠N = ∠K. But according to the given, angle at K is 90°, which would require ∠N to also be 90°, but then the third angle at L would be 0°, which isn't possible. So there's a contradiction here. This suggests that either the problem has conflicting information, or I'm misinterpreting the congruence.

Alternatively, maybe the congruence is between different sides. Let me check again. The given Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)): that is, KL ≅ LN. So KL and LN are congruent. Therefore, triangle KLN has sides KL=LN. Hence, the triangle is isosceles with KL=LN. Therefore, the apex is at L, and the base is KN. Wait, but if KL and LN are the equal sides, then the apex is at L, and the base is KN. Therefore, the base angles at K and N are equal. Wait, but angle at K is supposed to be 90°, leading to conflict. Unless the right angle is at L?

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) is the angle at K between L and N, which is ∠LKN, i.e., angle at K. So that's the right angle. But if KL=LN, then in triangle KLN, with KL=LN, and angle at K being 90°, then angle at N would be equal to angle at K? No, because KL and LN are the legs. Wait, if KL and LN are equal, then the triangle is isosceles with legs KL and LN, making the base KN. So angles at K and N are the base angles and should be equal. But angle at K is 90°, so angle at N must also be 90°, making the total angles 90+90+25=205°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that there's an error in my understanding. Let me re-express the given data carefully.

Given:

- Triangle KLN is isosceles, with KL ≅ LN (Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N))).
- RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)): angle at K between L and N is 90°, i.e., ∠LKN = 90°.
- MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,N)) = 25°, which is angle at L between K and N, i.e., ∠KLN = 25°.

So in triangle KLN:

- Angles: ∠K (at K) = 90°, ∠L (at L) = 25°, ∠N (at N) = ?
- Sum: 90 + 25 + ∠N = 180 ⇒ ∠N = 65°.
- But since KL ≅ LN, the sides KL and LN are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite them are equal. Side KL is opposite ∠N, side LN is opposite ∠K. So ∠N (opposite KL) should equal ∠K (opposite LN). But ∠K is 90°, ∠N is 65°, which aren't equal. Contradiction.

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the congruence is between different sides? Or maybe I've misread the congruence.

Wait, the congruence is Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)). So KL and LN are congruent. So KL = LN. Therefore, triangle KLN has sides KL = LN. Therefore, the triangle is isosceles with KL = LN. Therefore, the apex is at L, and the base is KN. So the two equal sides are KL and LN, meeting at L. Therefore, the base angles are at K and N, which should be equal. But angle at K is given as 90°, so angle at N should also be 90°, but then angle at L would be 0°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. This suggests that perhaps the given data contains inconsistencies, or I have made an error in interpreting the angle labels.

Wait, maybe the angle labels are different. Let me double-check the notation. 

Angle(K,L,N) refers to the angle at point L between points K and N. So that's ∠KLN, which is 25°, as per the given. So angle at L is 25°, angles at K and N are supposed to be equal due to KL = LN. But angle at K is given as a right angle. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

Wait, unless the right angle is not part of triangle KLN. Wait, but the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) refers to angle at K between L and N, which is part of triangle KLN. Therefore, the triangle KLN has a right angle at K, which conflicts with the isosceles condition. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement, but assuming the problem is consistent, perhaps I have misapplied the congruence.

Alternative interpretation: Maybe the congruence is between different segments. For example, perhaps Line(L,N) is congruent to another segment? Wait, the given Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)) means KL ≅ LN. So KL and LN are congruent. Therefore, triangle KLN is isosceles with KL = LN, making angles at K and N equal. But angle at K is 90°, so angle at N must also be 90°, which leads to angle at L being 0°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since it's given, perhaps I need to consider that the triangle is not just isosceles but also includes the right angle somehow. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at L instead of K. But the given predicate says RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)), which is angle at K. 

Wait, could there be a typo in the problem? Or perhaps the right angle is at N? Let me think. Suppose angle at N is the right angle. Then in triangle KLN, with KL = LN, and right angle at N. Then angles at K and L would be equal. Let's say ∠N = 90°, then ∠K + ∠L = 90°. But given that ∠KLN (angle at L) is 25°, so ∠L = 25°, then ∠K would be 65°, and ∠N = 90°, which fits KL = LN since angles opposite equal sides are equal. Wait, but if KL = LN, then the sides opposite angles N and K are equal. So side KL is opposite ∠N, and side LN is opposite ∠K. So if ∠N = 90°, and ∠K = 65°, then KL ≠ LN. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the right angle is at L, then ∠L = 90°, but given that ∠L is 25°, which contradicts. 

This is perplexing. Let me check if there's another way to interpret the congruence. Maybe the congruence is between Line(K,L) and Line(N,M)? No, the given is Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves more than just triangle KLN. Let me look at other parts of the diagram. 

Other elements: Point M is connected via Line(N,M) and Line(M,L), forming triangle LMN, which is isosceles with LM ≅ MN. So triangle LMN has LM = MN. Therefore, it's isosceles with base LN and equal sides LM and MN. So angles at L and N are equal. 

Additionally, there are other lines like Line(L,J), which connects L to J. And Angle(J,K,L) is 18°, which is angle at K between J and L. Also, Angle(J,K,N) is 130°, which is angle at K between J and N. 

Let me try to visualize this. Points J, K, L, M, N. Lines connect them in various ways. 

Perhaps focusing on triangle JKN. We know that angle at K between J and N is 130°, and angle at K between J and L is 18°, which suggests that points J, K, L, N are arranged such that from point K, there are two lines: one to J (making angle 18° with KL), and another to N (making angle 130° with KJ). 

Wait, angle JKL is 18°, which is angle at K between J and L. Angle JKN is 130°, which is angle at K between J and N. So the total angle around point K would be angle between JL and KN, which would be 18° + angle between KL and KN. Wait, but if angle between JK and KL is 18°, and angle between JK and KN is 130°, then the angle between KL and KN is 130° - 18° = 112°? Wait, no. Let me think about this.

At point K, we have lines to J, L, and N. The angles given are:

- Angle JKL: this is the angle between KJ and KL, which is 18°.
- Angle JKN: this is the angle between KJ and KN, which is 130°.

So, the angle between KL and KN would be angle JKN minus angle JKL. That is, 130° - 18° = 112°. So angle LKN is 112°? Wait, but earlier we were told that RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) which is angle LKN, implying it's 90°. But according to this calculation, it's 112°, which contradicts the right angle assertion. 

This suggests a contradiction again. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the angle between KL and KN is not directly subtractable. Let me draw this mentally. At point K, there are three lines: KJ, KL, and KN. The angle between KJ and KL is 18°, and the angle between KJ and KN is 130°. Depending on the arrangement of the points, the angle between KL and KN could be the difference between these two angles if they are adjacent. For instance, if points J, L, and N are arranged such that KL is between KJ and KN, then angle between KL and KN would be 130° - 18° = 112°. But this would contradict the given RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)), which states that angle LKN is 90°. 

Thus, this indicates a fundamental inconsistency in the given data. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must assume that I'm missing something. Let me revisit the given information.

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) is a separate predicate, not dependent on the other angles. So even though there's a contradiction in the triangle KLN, perhaps the problem requires considering all given data and resolving it. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not within triangle KLN but elsewhere. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) is the angle at K between L and N, so it's part of triangle KLN. So this is confusing. 

Perhaps the issue lies in the fact that triangle KLN is not a simple triangle, but part of a larger figure. Let me consider the entire configuration.

Points J, K, L, M, N are connected in various lines. Let me list all the lines:

- Line(J,K): connects J and K
- Line(K,L): connects K and L
- Line(L,N): connects L and N
- Line(N,M): connects N and M
- Line(M,L): connects M and L
- Line(L,J): connects L and J
- Line(K,N): connects K and N

So, points J is connected to K and L. K is connected to J, L, N. L is connected to K, N, M, J. N is connected to L, M, K. M is connected to N and L. 

Now, considering triangle KLN: points K, L, N. It's isosceles with KL ≅ LN. Also, there's a right angle at K (Angle(L,K,N) is right). So, in triangle KLN, KL = LN, and angle at K is 90°. But earlier calculation shows that this leads to contradictions. 

Wait, let's try to calculate the angles again, despite the contradiction. If KL = LN, and angle at K is 90°, then using the Law of Sines:

In triangle KLN, sides KL = LN = x, and side KN = y. 

Using Law of Sines:

KL / sin(∠N) = LN / sin(∠K) = KN / sin(∠L)

Since KL = LN, then sin(∠N) = sin(∠K). So ∠N = ∠K or ∠N = 180° - ∠K. 

But angle at K is 90°, so ∠N could be 90° or 90°. But then angle at L would be 180 - 90 - 90 = 0°, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if ∠N = 180° - ∠K = 90°, same problem. 

Hence, this suggests that the given data is inconsistent, but since it's a problem, perhaps there's an alternative interpretation. 

Maybe the congruence is not between KL and LN, but between other sides. Let me check the predicates again. 

The given Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)) means that KL ≅ LN. So that's fixed. 

Another possibility: Maybe the right angle is not part of triangle KLN, but the angle is at K between L and N, which is part of another triangle. Wait, but the angle LKN is part of triangle KLN. 

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle KLN is not a standard triangle, but part of a quadrilateral or other figure. 

Let me consider the rest of the diagram. There's also triangle LMN, which is isosceles with LM ≅ MN. So triangle LMN has LM = MN, so it's isosceles with base LN and equal sides LM and MN. 

Also, angle at N in triangle LMN is given as 20°, which is angle(L,N,M), which is angle at N between L and M. 

Let me focus on triangle LMN. Since LM = MN, angles at L and N are equal. Let's denote angle at L as α, angle at N as β, and angle at M as γ. 

Given angle(L,N,M) = 20°, which is angle at N between L and M, so β = 20°. Since LM = MN, angles at L and N are equal. Wait, no. In triangle LMN, sides LM and MN are equal. So the angles opposite them are equal. Side LM is opposite angle N, and side MN is opposite angle L. Hence, angles at N and L are equal. So angle at L (α) = angle at N (β) = 20°. Then angle at M (γ) = 180 - 2*20 = 140°. 

So in triangle LMN, angles are 20°, 20°, 140°. 

Now, let's go back to triangle KLN. Despite the earlier contradiction, perhaps we can proceed with the given data, assuming that the right angle is at K, and find relations with other parts. 

Given that angle at K in triangle KLN is 90°, and angle at L is 25°, then angle at N would be 65°, as before. Even though this contradicts the isosceles condition, perhaps we need to proceed. 

But why is triangle KLN isosceles? If KL = LN, then angles at K and N should be equal. But according to the given angles, they are 90° and 65°, which are not equal. This suggests that either the problem is flawed, or I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe the isosceles condition applies differently. Maybe the triangle is isosceles but not necessarily with the equal sides being KL and LN. Wait, the predicate says Isosceles(Triangle(K,L,N)), so it's isosceles, but it doesn't specify which sides are equal. But the congruence predicate says Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)), so KL ≅ LN, hence the equal sides are KL and LN. 

Assuming that the problem is consistent, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me try again. 

In triangle KLN, with KL ≅ LN, and angle at K being 90°, angle at L being 25°, then angle at N is 65°. But since KL ≅ LN, the sides KL and LN are equal. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle KLN:

KL² + LN² - 2*KL*LN*cos(angle at L) = KN²

But KL = LN = x, angle at L is 25°, so:

x² + x² - 2*x*x*cos(25°) = KN²  
=> 2x²(1 - cos(25°)) = KN²

But also, using Pythagoras if it's a right triangle. Wait, if angle at K is 90°, then KL² + KN² = LN² ? No, because angle at K is between KL and KN, so if angle at K is 90°, then by Pythagoras: 

KL² + KN² = LN² ?

Wait, no. In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides. If the right angle is at K, then the hypotenuse is LN, and the legs are KL and KN. So:

KL² + KN² = LN²

But KL = LN, so substituting:

KL² + KN² = KL² ⇒ KN² = 0 ⇒ KN = 0, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This confirms that the given conditions are contradictory, suggesting that there's an error in the problem statement. However, since the problem asks to find the measure of angle J, perhaps we can ignore the contradiction and proceed with the given data, assuming that the right angle is present and use other information. 

Let me try to proceed. 

From the given, angle JKN is 130°, which is the angle at K between J and N. Also, angle JKL is 18°, which is the angle at K between J and L. These two angles at K (between J-K-L and J-K-N) suggest that points L and N are on opposite sides of line KJ. So, the total angle around point K would be angle JKL (18°) + angle LKN (which is supposed to be 90°) + angle NKM (if there's another line), but I'm not sure. Wait, but angle JKN is 130°, which is the angle between KJ and KN. If angle JKL is 18°, then the angle between KL and KN is 130° - 18° = 112°, as previously thought. But this contradicts the right angle. 

However, if we accept that angle LKN is 90°, then the angle between KL and KN is 90°, so the angle between KJ and KN is 18° + 90° = 108°, but the given angle JKN is 130°, which doesn't match. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem, but since it's posed, perhaps I should proceed by ignoring the contradiction and focusing on the other parts. 

Let me try to find angle J. To do this, perhaps I need to consider triangle JKN. We know angle at K is 130°, and we need to find angle at J or N. But without more information, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, consider triangle JKL. We know angle at K is 18°, and possibly other angles. But without knowing sides or other angles, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but there's also the information about other triangles. Let me consider the full diagram. 

Points J, K, L, M, N are connected as follows:

- K is connected to J, L, N.
- L is connected to K, N, M, J.
- N is connected to L, M, K.
- M is connected to N and L.

Triangles involved:

- Triangle KLN: isosceles with KL = LN, right angle at K.
- Triangle LMN: isosceles with LM = MN, angle at N is 20°.

Also, angles given:

- Angle JKL = 18° (angle at K between J and L)
- Angle KLN = 25° (angle at L between K and N)
- Angle LNM = 20° (angle at N between L and M)
- Angle JKN = 130° (angle at K between J and N)

Assuming that despite the contradictions, we proceed. Let's try to find angle J. 

Let me consider triangle JKN. We know angle at K is 130°, and we need to find angle at J. To do this, we need more info. Perhaps we can find other angles or sides. 

Alternatively, consider that angle at K is composed of angle JKL (18°) and angle LKN (right angle 90°), totaling 108°, but this contradicts the given angle JKN of 130°. Hence, this suggests that the right angle is not part of triangle KLN, but perhaps another part. 

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) is angle at K between L and N, which is part of triangle KLN. So this is still conflicting. 

Maybe the problem uses the term "isosceles" in a different way, such as having two equal angles rather than two equal sides? No, in standard terms, isosceles means two equal sides. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are isosceles in a different manner. For example, triangle KLN has angles that are isosceles, but not necessarily sides. But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the congruence is not between KL and LN, but between other sides. Wait, the given is Congruent(Line(K,L), Line(L,N)), so KL and LN are congruent. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction in the given data. However, since the problem asks for angle J, perhaps I should proceed with the given angles and try to compute it, disregarding the contradiction. 

Let me consider triangle JKN. We know angle at K is 130°, and we need to find angle at J. If we can find another angle in this triangle, we can find the remaining angle. 

To find another angle, perhaps look at other triangles. For example, consider triangle KLM or others. 

But without more information, it's challenging. Let me think about the given angles. 

We have angle at L in triangle KLN is 25°, and in triangle LMN, angle at N is 20°. Maybe these angles can help. 

Let me consider point N. From triangle KLN, angle at N is 65° (as previously calculated, despite the contradiction). In triangle LMN, angle at N is 20°. So at point N, there are angles from different triangles. 

If we consider the full diagram, at point N, we have lines NL, NM, and NK. The angles at N would be:

- From triangle KLN: angle at N is 65° (assuming the earlier calculation)
- From triangle LMN: angle at N is 20°
- Plus any other angles from other connections.

But if these angles are adjacent, their sum would be 65° + 20° = 85°, but without knowing the full structure, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at N in triangle KLN is 65°, and in triangle LMN, it's 20°, which might relate to other parts. 

But how does this help with finding angle J? 

Let me return to triangle JKN. If we can find one more angle, we can find angle J. 

Suppose we assume that the contradiction is resolved by considering that the right angle is not part of triangle KLN, but the given RightAngle(Angle(L,K,N)) is part of another triangle. Wait, but it's explicitly stated as part of triangle KLN. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at L, but the given angle at L is 25°, which contradicts. 

At this point, I'm unable to resolve the contradiction, but since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps I can proceed by using the given angles and ignoring the contradiction. 

Let me try to calculate angle J. Assume that in triangle JKN, we have angle at K is 130°, and we need to find angle at J. If we can find angle at N, then angle J = 180 - 130 - angle at N. 

To find angle at N in triangle JKN, we need to determine its value. 

Looking at point N, we have angles from triangle KLN and LMN. 

In triangle KLN, if we ignore the contradiction, angle at N is 65° (as calculated earlier). In triangle LMN, angle at N is 20°. Assuming these are adjacent, the total angle at N from these two triangles would be 65 + 20 = 85°. But this may not be directly applicable to triangle JKN. 

However, if angle at N in triangle JKN is part of this 85°, then angle at N in triangle JKN would be 85°, leading to angle J = 180 - 130 - 85 = -35°, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if angle at N in triangle JKN is part of the 20° from triangle LMN, then angle J = 180 - 130 - 20 = 30°, which is not among the options. 

Alternatively, if angle at N in triangle JKN is the 65° from triangle KLN, then angle J = 180 - 130 - 65 = -15°, which is invalid. 

This suggests that this approach is incorrect. 

Perhaps I need to consider other triangles. For example, triangle JKL. We know angle at K is 18°, and if we can find other angles or sides, we can relate them. 

But without more information, it's difficult. 

Wait, let me think about the entire diagram. Points J, K, L, M, N are connected such that:

- Triangle KLN is isosceles with KL = LN.
- Triangle LMN is isosceles with LM = MN.
- Angles at K, L, N are given.
- Right angle at K in triangle KLN.
- Angle JKN is 130°.
- Angle JKL is 18°.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Assume point K, with lines to J, L, and N. At point K, angle between J and L is 18°, and between J and N is 130°, so the angle between L and N is 130° - 18° = 112°, but this contradicts the right angle. 

However, if we take the given right angle at K, then the angle between L and N is 90°, so the angle between J and L plus angle between J and N would be 90°, but given that angle JKL is 18°, then angle JKN would be 90° - 18° = 72°, but this contradicts the given 130°. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should try to use the given angles to find angle J, assuming that the right angle is at K and the other data is correct, even though it creates contradictions. 

Let me try this:

Assume that in triangle KLN, angle at K is 90°, angle at L is 25°, so angle at N is 65°. Now, consider triangle JKN. We know angle at K is 130°, and angle at N is 65°, so angle at J is 180 - 130 - 65 = -15°, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem, but since it's asked, perhaps the intended solution is to use the given angles and ignore the contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the angle at N in triangle JKN is not the same as in triangle KLN. Let me consider that. 

If I can find the measure of angle at N in triangle JKN, I can use it. How? 

At point N, there are lines NL, NM, and NK. From triangle KLN, angle at N is 65° (assuming earlier calculation), and from triangle LMN, angle at N is 20°. If these angles are adjacent, then total angle at N is 65 + 20 = 85°, which would be the angle between NL and NM. But how does this relate to angle at N in triangle JKN? 

If line NK is extending from N to K, and line NJ is extending from N to J, then the angle at N in triangle JKN would depend on the position of J relative to other points. Without a diagram, it's hard to say, but perhaps angle at N in triangle JKN is supplementary to some other angle. 

Alternatively, consider that angle JKN is 130°, and angle at K is 130°, and if we can find angle at N, we can find angle J. 

But without knowing angle at N, it's hard. 

Wait, perhaps using the fact that triangle LMN is isosceles with LM = MN, and angle at N is 20°, so angle at L is 20°, and angle at M is 140°. 

Then, in triangle LMN, angle at L is 20°, which is angle MLN. 

Now, at point L, we have angles from triangle KLN (angle KLN = 25°), from triangle LMN (angle MLN = 20°), and from line LJ. 

If we can find the angle at L from other parts, perhaps we can find relations. 

At point L, the angles around it would include:

- Angle KLN = 25° (from triangle KLN)
- Angle MLN = 20° (from triangle LMN)
- Angle JLK (part of triangle JKL)

Assuming these angles are adjacent, their sum would be 25 + 20 + angle JLK = ... but without knowing the full structure, it's unclear. 

However, if we assume that angle JLK is part of the diagram, and given that angle JKL is 18°, perhaps we can relate it. 

In triangle JKL, we have angle at K is 18°, and if we can find other angles or sides, we could relate them. 

But this is getting too vague. Given the time I've invested without resolution, I'll try to proceed with the given answer choices and see which one makes sense. 

The question asks for the measure of angle J. Let's consider that in triangle JKN, angle at K is 130°, and if we can find angle at N, we can find angle J. 

Assume that angle at N in triangle JKN is 20° (from triangle LMN), then angle J would be 180 - 130 - 20 = 30°, which is not an option. 

If angle at N is 65°, then angle J = 180 - 130 - 65 = -15°, invalid. 

If angle at N is 25° (from triangle KLN), angle J = 180 - 130 - 25 = 25°, not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle at N is 90° (the right angle), then angle J = 180 - 130 - 90 = -40°, no. 

This suggests that none of these work, but since the answer choices are A-D, and the only plausible way is to consider that angle J is formed by combining angles from other parts. 

Wait, perhaps angle J is part of a larger triangle or quadrilateral. Let me think about the full diagram. 

If we consider quadrilateral JKLM or something similar, but without more information, it's hard. 

Alternatively, consider that angle J is part of triangle JKL, where we know angle at K is 18°, and if we can find another angle. 

But without knowing sides or other angles, it's hard. 

Wait, perhaps using the given angles to find the measure of angle J. 

Let me think: the total angle around point K is 360°. At point K, we have:

- Angle JKL = 18° (between J and L)
- Angle JKN = 130° (between J and N)
- Angle LKN = 90° (right angle, between L and N)

Wait, but if these angles are around point K, their sum should be 360°. Let's add them: 18 + 130 + 90 = 238°, leaving 360 - 238 = 122° unaccounted for. This suggests there's another angle at K, but it's not specified. 

This indicates that the given data is incomplete or inconsistent. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of resolution, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the given answer choices and the most plausible scenario. 

Assuming that the right angle is at K, and angle JKN is 130°, and angle JKL is 18°, then the angle between KL and KN is 130° - 18° = 112°, which would be angle LKN. But this contradicts the right angle. If we ignore this contradiction and assume that angle LKN is 112°, then in triangle KLN, angles are:

- ∠K = 112°
- ∠L = 25°
- ∠N = 180 - 112 - 25 = 43°

Since KL = LN, the angles opposite these sides should be equal. Wait, KL and LN are equal, so angles opposite them are ∠N and ∠K. So ∠N = ∠K, which would require 43° = 112°, which is false. 

But if we proceed, assuming that angle at N is 43°, then in triangle JKN, angle at N is 43°, so angle J = 180 - 130 - 43 = 7°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle at N is 25° (from triangle KLN), then angle J = 180 - 130 - 25 = 25°, not an option. 

Given that none of these fit, and the answer choices are A. 105, B. 106, C. 108, D. 111, I might consider that the correct answer is 105°, which is option A, as it's a common angle in such problems. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the given angles to calculate. Let me think: 

If we consider that angle at K in triangle JKN is 130°, and we need to find angle J. If we can find the other angles in the diagram, perhaps through other triangles. 

For example, in triangle LMN, angle at M is 140°, as calculated earlier. If we can relate this to other parts. 

But without more information, it's hard. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll choose the answer that is likely to be correct based on standard problems. Often, in such configurations, the angle J is found by adding or subtracting given angles. 

For example, if angle J is formed by combining angles from other parts. Let's say angle J is 180° - (130° + 25°) = 25°, but not matching. Or 180 - (130 + 20) = 30°. Not matching.
