MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points, lines, circles, and the given conditions.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, O. There's a circle centered at O. Lines mentioned include AB, BO, EO, OA, OE, AC, CD, DG, GE. Also, there are tangents: Line AB is tangent to the circle at O? Wait, no—the tangent is Line(A,B) to Circle(O). So maybe AB is tangent to the circle centered at O? Similarly, Line(E,G) is tangent to the circle. Also, there are right angles at Angle(O,A,B) and Angle(O,E,G). That means OA is perpendicular to AB, and OE is perpendicular to EG. 

Also, some angle measures are given. For example, measure of angle ACD is 50 degrees. Then, measure of angle B is x + 2.5, measure of angle E is 4x +5. Also, measure of angle AOD is twice angle ACD, so twice 50, which is 100 degrees. And measure of angle BOE is both 180 - 2*measure of angle B and also 180 - 2*measure of angle E. So these two expressions for angle BOE must be equal, leading to equations involving x.

Wait, let me note down all the given equations:

1. Measure(Angle(A,C,D)) = 50°
2. Measure(Angle(B)) = x + 2.5°
3. Measure(Angle(E)) = 4x + 5°
4. Measure(Angle(A,O,D)) = 2 * Measure(Angle(A,C,D)) → 2*50 = 100°
5. Measure(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*Measure(Angle(B))
6. Measure(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*Measure(Angle(E))

So since both expressions equal Measure(Angle(B,O,E)), we can set them equal to each other:

180 - 2*(x + 2.5) = 180 - 2*(4x + 5)

Let me write that equation:

Left side: 180 - 2x -5 = 175 - 2x

Right side: 180 - 8x -10 = 170 -8x

Set equal:

175 - 2x = 170 -8x

Adding 8x to both sides:

175 +6x = 170

Subtract 170:

5 +6x = 0 → 6x = -5 → x = -5/6 ≈ -0.833...

But that gives a negative value, which doesn't make sense for angle measures. Hmm, that suggests a mistake. Let me check my setup again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in expanding the terms. Let me re-express:

Original equation:

180 - 2*(x + 2.5) = 180 - 2*(4x +5)

Compute left side: 180 - 2x -5 = 175 -2x

Right side: 180 -8x -10 = 170 -8x

Setting equal:

175 -2x = 170 -8x

Add 8x to both sides: 175 +6x = 170

Then subtract 170: 5 +6x=0 → 6x= -5 → x=-5/6. Same result. Negative x? That's impossible because angles can't be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in interpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicates. Let me go back.

Looking at the given predicates:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(B)))"

and 

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(E)))"

Therefore, setting those two equal:

180 - 2*(x+2.5) = 180 - 2*(4x +5)

Which simplifies to same equation. But getting negative x suggests inconsistency. Maybe there's another relation?

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something about the diagram. Let me think about the diagram structure.

Points O is center of the circle. AB is tangent to the circle, so OA is radius, and AB is tangent, hence OA ⊥ AB. Similarly, OE is radius, and EG is tangent, so OE ⊥ EG.

Given that OA is perpendicular to AB, and OE is perpendicular to EG. Also, there are lines connecting O to A and E, and lines AC, CD, DG, GE. Also, angle ACD is 50 degrees. Also, angle AOD is twice angle ACD, which is 100 degrees. 

Maybe there's more relations here. Let me consider triangle AOD. Since O is the center, OA and OD are radii? Wait, but if O is the center, then OA is a radius. However, point D is connected via line CD, DG, and G is connected to E. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe angle AOD relates to arcs in the circle. Since angle AOD is a central angle, its measure would be equal to the arc AD. But angle ACD is an inscribed angle? Wait, angle ACD is formed by points A, C, D. Depending on where C and D are located.

Alternatively, since angle ACD is 50 degrees, and angle AOD is 100 degrees, which is double. This suggests that angle AOD could be a central angle corresponding to the same arc as angle ACD, which would be an inscribed angle. Thus, if angle ACD is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, then the central angle would be twice that, so 100 degrees. Hence, angle AOD is indeed 100 degrees. So that seems okay.

Now, focusing back on the main issue with x. Getting a negative x suggests that there's an error in the setup. Let me check again the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations should involve different angles. Let me check the original problem again.

The problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(B)))"

and 

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(E)))"

Thus, equating them gives 180 - 2B = 180 - 2E ⇒ 2B = 2E ⇒ B=E. So angle B equals angle E. But angle B is x+2.5 and angle E is 4x+5. Therefore:

x + 2.5 = 4x +5

Solving:

2.5 -5 = 4x -x

-2.5 = 3x

x = -2.5 /3 ≈ -0.833... Again same result. Which is impossible. So either there's a miscalculation, or perhaps misunderstanding the angles.

Wait, perhaps angle B and angle E are not directly the same. Because angle B refers to angle at point B? Or is it angle ABC or something else? Wait, the problem uses MeasureOf(Angle(B)), which typically denotes the angle at point B. But depending on the diagram, angle B could be part of a triangle.

Wait, the original problem mentions:

- RightAngle(Angle(O,A,B)): So angle at O between OA and OB? No—right angle is at A? Wait, the syntax is Angle(O,A,B), which usually represents the angle at point A, between points O, A, B. So angle OAB is a right angle. Similarly, Angle(O,E,G) is a right angle at E, between O, E, G.

So, angle OAB is 90 degrees, and angle OEG is 90 degrees.

So, for angle B, if it's referring to angle at point B, perhaps angle OBA? Or another angle?

Wait, the problem states "MeasureOf(Angle(B))". In standard notation, Angle(B) would mean the angle at vertex B. But without knowing which sides form the angle, it's ambiguous. However, looking at the other parts of the problem, like "MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E))", which would be the angle at point O between points B and E. So, Angle(B,O,E) is angle at O between B and E.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is likely angle at B. But given that there are lines BA, BO, and others, perhaps angle B refers to angle at B between BA and BO? Because BO is a line from B to O.

Wait, given that there's a line BO, which connects B to O. Also, line AB is tangent to the circle at O? Wait, no, the tangent line is Line(A,B), which is tangent to the circle centered at O. So, since AB is tangent to the circle at point O? Wait, no. A tangent line touches the circle at one point. If AB is tangent to the circle, then the point of tangency is somewhere along AB. But since O is the center, the radius to the point of tangency would be perpendicular to AB. Given that OA is a line from O to A, and AB is tangent, then OA is perpendicular to AB. So the point of tangency is A? Because OA is perpendicular to AB, implying that A lies on the circle. Because if OA is a radius and AB is tangent at A, then yes. Therefore, point A is on the circle. Similarly, since line EG is tangent to the circle, and OE is a radius (since O is the center), then E is the point of tangency. So point E is on the circle.

So points A and E lie on the circle centered at O. Therefore, OA and OE are radii. Thus, OA = OE.

Additionally, since AB is tangent at A, then OA ⊥ AB. Similarly, OE ⊥ EG.

Now, considering triangle OAB: right-angled at A, since OA is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, triangle OEG is right-angled at E.

Now, angle B in MeasureOf(Angle(B)) – if this refers to angle at B, which would be angle between BA and BO. Because BO is a line from B to O. So angle at B between BA and BO.

Similarly, angle E in MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is likely angle at E between BE and something else? But the line EG is present, so maybe angle at E between EG and EO? Since EG is tangent and EO is radius.

But let's try to clarify. Let's assume that MeasureOf(Angle(B)) refers to angle at B, which in triangle OAB is angle at B. Since triangle OAB has a right angle at A, then the sum of angles at O and B is 90 degrees. So angle at B (angle OBA) plus angle at O (angle AOB) equals 90 degrees.

Similarly, for angle E, if it's angle at E between EO and EG, which would be angle OEG, which is a right angle. Wait, but the problem says RightAngle(Angle(O,E,G)), which is angle at E between O and G, i.e., angle OEG is 90 degrees. So angle at E is 90 degrees. But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is 4x +5. So if angle E is 90 degrees, then 4x +5 = 90 → 4x = 85 → x = 21.25. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe angle E refers to another angle.

Alternatively, maybe MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to angle at E between two lines, such as EO and ED or something else. But without seeing the full diagram, it's challenging. However, the problem includes lines CD and DG. Point D is connected to C and G. Also, angle ACD is 50 degrees. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram mentally.

Assuming points A and E are on the circle. Lines AB and EG are tangent. Lines OA and OE are radii. Points C and D are connected via CD, D to G, and G to E. Also, line AC connects A to C, CD connects C to D, DG connects D to G, GE connects G to E. So, starting from A, going to C, then D, then G, then E. So points A-C-D-G-E, forming a polygonal chain. Angle at C, angle ACD is 50 degrees.

Moreover, angle AOD is 100 degrees, which is twice angle ACD. Since angle AOD is a central angle, and angle ACD is an inscribed angle. So if angle ACD subtends arc AD, then the central angle would be twice that. So arc AD is 100 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle AOD is 100 degrees.

Now, returning to the earlier problem with the equations. If MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) is equal to 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and also 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(E)), then equate them:

180 - 2B = 180 - 2E → B = E. So angle B equals angle E.

But angle B is at point B, which in triangle OAB is angle OBA. And angle E is at point E, which in triangle OEG is angle OEG, which is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle OEG is a right angle, as per the predicate. So if angle E is 90 degrees, then angle B would also be 90 degrees. But angle B is x + 2.5, so x + 2.5 = 90 → x = 87.5. Which isn't among the options either. So there's a contradiction here. Clearly, my assumption about what angle E refers to is incorrect.

Alternative interpretation: Perhaps MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to angle at E between lines EA and something else. Let's think again about the lines connected to E. There's line EO (from E to O), and line EG (from E to G). Also, since line GE is tangent to the circle at E, as per the predicate Tangent(Line(E,G), Circle(O)). So line EG is tangent at E, making OE perpendicular to EG. So angle at E between EO and EG is 90 degrees. So if MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to this angle, then it's 90 degrees. But then angle B is also supposed to be equal to it, leading to x + 2.5 = 90 → x = 87.5. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, maybe MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to another angle at E. For instance, if there's a triangle involving E and other points. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe angle E refers to angle at E between lines EB and something else. But unless we know the connections, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps angle B refers to angle at B between lines BO and BA. Since BO is a line from B to O, and BA is the tangent. So in triangle OAB, angle at B is angle OBA. And angle OBA can be found using right triangle OAB. Since OA is perpendicular to AB, OA is one leg, AB is another leg, and OB is hypotenuse. So in triangle OAB, angle at B is complementary to angle at O. So angle OBA = 90 - angle AOB.

Similarly, angle AOB is the central angle over arc AB. But since AB is tangent at A, and OA is radius, then arc AB would be... Wait, the tangent at A implies that the radius OA is perpendicular to AB. The central angle over arc AB would depend on the position of B relative to the circle. However, without more info, it's difficult.

But perhaps we can find angle AOB. Since OA is radius, and OB is a line from center O to point B. But point B is outside the circle since AB is tangent. So OB is longer than OA (radius). In triangle OAB, right-angled at A, we can express angles in terms of sides. For example, tan(angle OBA) = OA / AB. But without lengths, this may not help.

However, the problem gives MeasureOf(Angle(B)) as x + 2.5 and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) as 4x +5. Earlier, we tried assuming angle E is 90 degrees, leading to inconsistency. Perhaps angle E is not 90 degrees, but another angle. Let's reconsider the possibility that MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to angle at E between EO and ED or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle E refers to angle at E between lines EC and ED, but there's no mention of point C or D connected to E. However, point D is connected to G, and G to E. So D is connected to G, which is connected to E. So maybe angle at E involves line EG and another line. 

This is getting too vague. Let me think differently. Let's focus on the equations we have. We had earlier that angle B equals angle E, leading to x + 2.5 = 4x +5 → -2.5 = 3x → x = -5/6. This is invalid. So there must be an error in the assumption that MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) are the same as angle B and angle E in the equations. Perhaps they refer to different angles.

Let me re-examine the problem statement for MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(E)).

The problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), x + 2.5)"

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), 4x + 5)"

So MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is an angle whose measure is x + 2.5, and similarly for Angle(E).

But what is Angle(B)? In geometry, Angle(B) typically means the angle at vertex B. But without knowing the sides, it's ambiguous. However, given the presence of lines BO and BA, maybe it's angle at B between BA and BO, which is angle OBA.

Similarly, Angle(E) could be angle at E between EO and EG, which is 90 degrees. But if that's the case, then 4x +5 = 90 → x = (90 -5)/4 = 85/4 = 21.25, which is not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe Angle(E) refers to angle at E between lines ED and EG. But there's no info about ED. Or angle at E between EO and ED? Without knowing the diagram, it's tricky.

Another approach: Let's use the fact that angle AOD is 100 degrees. Since O is the center, and A and D are points on the circle? Wait, A is on the circle (as AB is tangent at A), but D's position is unclear. If angle AOD is 100 degrees, then arc AD is 100 degrees. 

Also, angle ACD is 50 degrees. If C is a point on the circumference, then angle ACD could be an inscribed angle subtending arc AD. Inscribed angle is half the central angle, so 50 degrees would correspond to arc AD being 100 degrees, which matches angle AOD being 100 degrees. So that checks out. So point C is on the circle?

Wait, if angle ACD is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, then point C must lie on the circumference of the circle. But the problem doesn't state that explicitly. However, given that angle ACD is 50 degrees, and angle AOD is 100 degrees, it's likely that C is on the circle. So points A, C, D, E, G are on the circle? Or some of them.

But since AB is tangent at A, and EG is tangent at E, points A and E are on the circle. If C and D are also on the circle, then angle ACD would be an inscribed angle. Assuming that, then C and D are on the circle. So points A, C, D, E, G are on the circle. Then line CD is a chord of the circle.

So, with that, let's think about other angles. Now, returning to the equations involving angle B and angle E.

If MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at B, which is outside the circle, and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is angle at E, which is on the circle. But since EG is tangent at E, then angle between tangent EG and chord ED (if D is on the circle) would be equal to the inscribed angle subtended by ED. But without knowing where D is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since angle AOD is 100 degrees, and if D is on the circle, then arc AD is 100 degrees. If C is also on the circle, then angle ACD is an inscribed angle over arc AD, which is 50 degrees, as given. So that works.

Now, focusing back on the equations. Let's suppose that MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is the external angle at point B, formed by the tangent AB and line BO. In this case, angle OBA is part of the right triangle OAB. Let's denote angle at B as θ = x + 2.5, and angle at O as φ = 90 - θ, since the triangle OAB is right-angled at A.

Similarly, for point E, if MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is the angle between tangent EG and line EO, which is 90 degrees, but that leads us back to previous contradictions. Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to some other angle at E.

Wait, there's a line from E to G, which is tangent, and line from E to O (radius). Also, there's line from D to G, and line from C to D. So point G is connected to D and E. If D is on the circle, then line DG is a chord. Since G is on the circle (because line EG is tangent at E, so G is a point outside the circle? No, wait, line EG is tangent to the circle at E, so E is the point of tangency, and G is a point on the tangent line beyond E. So G is outside the circle.

So, if D is on the circle, then line DG goes from D (on circle) to G (outside). So angle at D between DC and DG? Not sure.

Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to angle at E between EO and ED. But without knowing where D is, it's unclear.

This seems too vague. Let me try another approach. Since we have conflicting results from the equations, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck the equations.

From the problem:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) ... (1)

MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(E)) ... (2)

So setting (1) = (2):

180 - 2B = 180 - 2E → 2B = 2E → B = E

Thus, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(E)) → x + 2.5 = 4x +5 → 2.5 -5 = 3x → -2.5 = 3x → x = -5/6, which is impossible. 

This suggests that either the problem has no solution under given constraints, or there's a misinterpretation of the angles.

Perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) are not the angles at B and E, but rather other angles. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) could be angle at B between BA and BC, and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) could be angle at E between EG and ED. But without knowing the diagram, it's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the equations involve supplementary angles or other relationships. Let me think about the diagram again.

Since angle AOD is 100 degrees, and if D is on the circle, then arc AD is 100 degrees. Let's assume that. Now, if we look at point C, which forms angle ACD = 50 degrees. If C is on the circle, then as before, this is an inscribed angle over arc AD, confirming arc AD is 100 degrees.

Now, considering line AC and CD. If C is on the circle, then AC is a chord from A to C, and CD is another chord from C to D. So angle at C (ACD) is 50 degrees.

Now, regarding angle B and angle E. Let's think about triangle OAB. It's a right triangle at A. So angle at B is angle OBA = x + 2.5. Let's call this angle β = x + 2.5. Then, angle at O in triangle OAB is 90 - β. 

Similarly, for point E, since line EG is tangent at E, and OE is a radius, angle OEG is 90 degrees. If MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is this right angle, then 4x +5 = 90 → x = (90 -5)/4 = 85/4 = 21.25, which is not an option. But none of the answer choices are 21.25, so this is wrong.

Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(E)) refers to angle at E between lines EO and ED. Suppose D is on the circle, then ED is a chord from E to D. The angle between EO (radius) and ED would be equal to the angle between the radius and the chord, which is related to the arc. For example, if ED subtends arc from E to D, then the angle between EO and ED would be half the arc from E to D. But without knowing the arc, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since angle AOD is 100 degrees, and if D is on the circle, then arc AD is 100 degrees. If E is another point on the circle, then the arc from E to D depends on the position of E.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still difficult. Let me try to think about the other equations.

We also have MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and also 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(E)).

Let me denote MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) as γ.

So γ = 180 - 2β = 180 - 2δ, where δ is MeasureOf(Angle(E)).

So 180 - 2β = 180 - 2δ → β = δ.

So β = δ → x + 2.5 = 4x +5 → x = -5/6, which is invalid.

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given information, or that my assumptions about what angles β and δ represent are wrong.

Maybe MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is not the angle at B in triangle OAB, but another angle. For example, if there's a triangle involving B and other points. Let me check the lines: Line(A,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,G), Line(G,E). So points A-C-D-G-E. If B is connected to O and A, and C is connected to A and D, then perhaps angle at B is part of another triangle.

Alternatively, maybe MeasureOf(Angle(B)) refers to angle at B between lines BA and BC. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to say. If C is on the circle, then BC would be a secant or tangent. But this is too vague.

At this point, I'm stuck due to ambiguity in the angle definitions. Perhaps I need to look for alternative approaches using other given information.

We know that angle AOD is 100 degrees. Since O is the center, and if D is on the circle, then OD is a radius. So OA and OD are radii. So triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle with OA = OD. Angle at O is 100 degrees, so base angles at A and D are (180-100)/2 = 40 degrees each. So angle OAD = angle ODA = 40 degrees.

But angle OAD is part of the diagram. If line AC is present, and C is on the circle, then angle OAD is 40 degrees. But how does this relate to other parts?

Also, angle ACD is 50 degrees. If C is on the circle, then angle ACD is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, which is 100 degrees, as previously determined. So that fits.

Now, let's consider triangle ACD. Angle at C is 50 degrees, and if we can find other angles in this triangle, maybe we can relate them to other parts.

But without knowing more about points A, C, D, it's hard to proceed. Let's try to connect this to the earlier equations.

Back to the problem: the only way to resolve the conflict in the equations is if there's a misinterpretation of the angles. Perhaps MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) are not the angles at B and E, but other angles.

For example, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) could be angle at O between OB and something else. Or MeasureOf(Angle(E)) could be angle at O between OE and something else. Let me explore this.

If MeasureOf(Angle(B)) refers to angle at O between OB and some line, and similarly for MeasureOf(Angle(E)) at O. Let's see.

Given that there's a line BO and line OE. If MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at O between BO and another line, like BA or something. But BA is tangent at A, and OA is radius. So line BO connects B to O, and line BA is tangent. If we consider angle between BO and BA, that would be angle OBA, which is the same as before. So this brings us back to the same issue.

Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at O between OB and OC, but without knowing where C is, it's unclear.

At this point, given the time I've spent without resolving the contradiction, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me try plugging in the answer choices to see which one satisfies the equations, even though it led to a contradiction.

Suppose x = 27.5 (option B). Let's plug into the equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = x + 2.5 = 27.5 + 2.5 = 30 degrees.

MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4x +5 = 4*27.5 +5 = 110 +5 = 115 degrees.

Now, according to the earlier equation, MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2*30 = 120 degrees, and also 180 - 2*115 = 180 - 230 = -50 degrees. This is impossible, so x=27.5 is invalid.

Try option C: x = 50.

MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = 50 + 2.5 = 52.5 degrees.

MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4*50 +5 = 205 degrees. Impossible.

Option D: x = 105.

MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = 105 +2.5 = 107.5 degrees. MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4*105 +5 = 425 degrees. No good.

Option A: x = 25.

MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = 25 + 2.5 = 27.5 degrees.

MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4*25 +5 = 105 degrees.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) would be 180 - 2*27.5 = 125 degrees, and also 180 - 2*105 = 180 - 210 = -30 degrees. Still impossible.

None of the options work, suggesting a fundamental error in the setup. Perhaps the initial assumption that angle B and angle E are the same is wrong, and instead, there's another relationship.

Wait, let me revisit the equations. The problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(B)))"

and 

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(E)))"

So, if I denote MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) as gamma, then:

gamma = 180 - 2B = 180 - 2E → 2B = 2E → B = E.

But if this is not possible, maybe there's a typo in the problem, or I misread it. Let me check the original problem again.

The original problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(B)))"

and 

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)), 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(E)))"

So, both expressions for gamma are equal, leading to B = E. But this leads to a contradiction.

Unless MeasureOf(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) are not angles at B and E, but at other points. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(B)) could be angle at O between OB and something, and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) at O between OE and something.

Let me assume that MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at O between OB and OA, and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is angle at O between OE and some other line.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is angle at O between OB and OC, and MeasureOf(Angle(E)) is angle at O between OE and OD, but this is pure speculation.

Given that I'm stuck, and the only way to proceed is to assume that there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps. Let me re-express the equations.

We have:

180 - 2B = 180 - 2E → B = E.

But if this is not possible, perhaps the equations are meant to be:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(B)) 

and 

MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 180 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(E)) 

But if these are both true, then B = E, but this leads to a contradiction. Hence, the only possibility is that one of the equations is incorrect, or there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) is not an exterior angle, but an interior angle. For example, if points B, O, E are arranged such that angle at O is formed by OB and OE, and the measure is computed accordingly.

Let me think about the configuration. Points B and E are outside the circle, with O as center. Lines BO and EO are from the center to points B and E. The angle at O between B and E is angle BOE. So MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) is angle BOE.

In that case, angle BOE = 180 - 2B and also 180 - 2E. So, angle BOE = 180 - 2B = 180 - 2E → B = E.

But this still leads to the same conclusion.

However, if angle BOE is related to other parts of the diagram. For example, if points B and E are symmetric with respect to some axis, or if angle BOE is equal to some other angle.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that angle BOE is equal to angle AOD, which is 100 degrees. So 100 = 180 - 2B → 2B = 80 → B = 40 degrees. Similarly, 100 = 180 - 2E → E = 40 degrees. But this would mean B = E = 40 degrees. Let's see if this fits with other equations.

If B = 40 degrees, then x + 2.5 = 40 → x = 37.5. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4x +5 = 4*37.5 +5 = 155 degrees. But then 180 - 2E = 180 - 2*155 = 180 - 310 = -130, which doesn't match. So this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, if angle BOE is related to angle AOD, which is 100 degrees. So 100 = 180 - 2B → B = 40, and also 100 = 180 - 2E → E = 40. But this would require MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 40, so 4x +5 = 40 → x = 35/4 = 8.75, which is not an option.

This is not helping. Given the time I've invested and lack of progress, perhaps the intended answer is B, 27.5, and there was a miscalculation. Let me try x = 27.5.

If x = 27.5, then MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = 27.5 + 2.5 = 30 degrees. MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = 4*27.5 +5 = 115 degrees. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) would be 180 - 2*30 = 120 degrees, and also 180 - 2*115 = -50, which is invalid. But if there's a mistake in the sign, perhaps it should be 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) - 180, leading to 2*30 - 180 = -120, still no.

Alternatively, if the formula is MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) = 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) - 180, then 2*30 - 180 = -120, still no. 

Alternatively, if MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)) is supplementary to 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)), so 180 - 2*MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,E)).

But this brings us back to the same issue.

At this point, I think there must be an error in the problem setup, or perhaps a misinterpretation of the angle measures. Given that the options are A. 25, B. 27.5, C. 50, D. 105, and the only plausible value that comes close is x = 27.5, even though it leads to inconsistencies, I'll choose B as the answer.
