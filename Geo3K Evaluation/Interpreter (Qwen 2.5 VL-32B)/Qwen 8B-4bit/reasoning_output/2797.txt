Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of RW given some other lengths and perpendicular relationships. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, there are points R, L, T, W, S. Then there are several lines connecting them: RL, RT, RW, LT, LW, WS, RS. Also, there are two triangles mentioned: Triangle(R,L,T) and Triangle(R,L,S). Plus, there are some angles mentioned—Angle(R,T,L) and Angle(L,W,S)—and they're both right angles. Also, the lengths of RL=5, RT=9, and WS=6. 

Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine it. Let's note down the coordinates if possible. Wait, maybe coordinate geometry could be helpful here because we have right angles and known lengths.

Starting with point R connected to L, T, and W. Since there's a right angle at Angle(R,T,L), which means that lines RT and LT form a right angle at point T. Wait, the Angle(R,T,L) is a right angle. So, that implies that RT is perpendicular to LT? Wait, no—the angle at T is between R-T-L. So, the angle at T is formed by segments TR and TL. Therefore, RT and LT are perpendicular. Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(L,T), Line(R,T)). Oh yes, that's given. So Line(L,T) is perpendicular to Line(R,T). That confirms the right angle at T between those two lines.

So triangle RTL is a right triangle with right angle at T. Given that RL is 5 units, RT is 9 units. Wait, hold on—if RT is one leg, LT is another leg, and RL is the hypotenuse. Wait, but according to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the sum of squares of legs equals square of hypotenuse. But here, RL is given as 5, RT is 9. Wait, that seems impossible because if RT is 9, which is longer than RL=5. That suggests that perhaps my understanding is wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. The line RL has length 5, so RL is the segment from R to L. The line RT has length 9, so RT is from R to T. And the right angle is at T between RT and LT. So triangle RTL has sides RT=9, LT=?, and RL=5. But in a right triangle, the hypotenuse should be the longest side. Here, if RT is 9, then the hypotenuse would be either RT or LT. But RL is the hypotenuse here? Because the right angle is at T, so the hypotenuse is RL. Wait, that would mean RL^2 = RT^2 + LT^2. Plugging numbers: 5² = 9² + LT² → 25 = 81 + LT² → LT² = negative number. Which isn't possible. There's a contradiction here. That suggests I made a mistake in identifying which sides are which.

Ah! Wait, maybe the right angle is at L? No, the Angle(R,T,L) is given, meaning the vertex is T. So the angle at T is between RT and LT. So the right angle is at T. Therefore, RT and LT are the legs, and RL is the hypotenuse. But then RT=9, LT=?, RL=5. But that leads to 9² + LT² = 5², which is impossible. So something's wrong here. Maybe I misread the given lengths?

Looking back: Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,L)), 5), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,T)), 9), Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,S)), 6). So RL=5, RT=9, WS=6. So that's correct. So why does this lead to a contradiction? Maybe there's a misunderstanding about which triangle we're considering. The triangle RTL is mentioned, but if the right angle is at T, then the hypotenuse should be RL. However, RT is longer than RL, which can't happen. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in my interpretation of the triangle's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not part of triangle RTL? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)), which is the same as the angle at T in triangle RTL. So that's conflicting. Unless there's a different configuration. Maybe the lines aren't forming the triangle as I thought. Let me re-examine the lines given. The lines are RL, RT, RW, LT, LW, WS, RS. The triangle RTL includes lines RL, RT, LT. So the triangle is formed by points R, L, T. With RT and LT being two sides meeting at T, forming a right angle. But then RL is the hypotenuse. But RT is 9, which is longer than RL=5. That's impossible. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not between RT and LT? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(L,T), Line(R,T)), which means that lines LT and RT are perpendicular. So that's the right angle at T. Hence, triangle RTL has legs RT and LT, and hypotenuse RL. But then with RT=9 and RL=5, that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not corresponding to the sides of the triangle. Wait, maybe RL is not the hypotenuse. Let me think again: In triangle RTL, with right angle at T, the hypotenuse is RL. But if RT is one leg (from R to T), LT is another leg (from L to T), and RL connects R to L. So the hypotenuse is RL. So according to Pythagoras: RL² = RT² + LT². But substituting the given values: 5² = 9² + LT² → 25 = 81 + LT² → LT² = -56, which is impossible. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. How can that be?

This suggests that there's an error in my assumptions. Perhaps the triangle RTL is not a right triangle? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)), which is the angle at T. So that's supposed to be a right angle. Hmm. Maybe the given lengths are not for the sides of the triangle? Or perhaps the lines are not the sides of the triangle? Wait, the triangle RTL includes the lines RL, RT, LT. So those three lines form the triangle. Therefore, the triangle RTL has sides RT=9, LT=?, and RL=5. But that would make RT longer than RL, which is impossible if it's a leg of a right triangle. So this seems contradictory. 

Wait, unless the right angle is not part of the triangle RTL. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)), which is the angle at T between points R-T-L. So that angle is indeed part of triangle RTL. So there's a contradiction here. Is there a possibility that I've misread the given data? Let me double-check the original problem.

Original problem states: "Given GEOMETRIC PREDICATES: ... RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)) ... Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,L)), 5) ... Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,T)), 9)". So that's correct. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Unless there's a miscalculation on my part. Let me recalculate: If RL is the hypotenuse, then RL² = RT² + LT². So 5² = 9² + LT² → 25 = 81 + LT² → LT² = 25 - 81 = -56. Negative length squared? Impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the triangle RTL is not a right triangle? But the predicate says it is. Or maybe the lines are not the sides of the triangle? For example, maybe Line(R,L) is not a side of the triangle RTL. Wait, no—Triangle(R,L,T) includes the lines RL, RT, LT. So those three lines are the sides. Therefore, the triangle must have these sides. So the problem seems inconsistent. Unless... wait, perhaps the length of Line(R,L) is not the hypotenuse. Wait, but in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. If RT is 9, which is longer than RL=5, then RT cannot be a leg. Therefore, the only way this works is if RT is the hypotenuse. Wait, but then where is the right angle? If the right angle is at L instead of T. But the given angle is at T. 

Hmm, this seems like a contradiction. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the configuration. Let me consider alternative configurations. Suppose the right angle is at L, making the hypotenuse RT. But the given angle is at T. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at R? But the angle is specified as Angle(R,T,L), which is at T. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines RT and LT are not the legs but something else. Wait, if the right angle is at T, then the legs are RT and LT, and the hypotenuse is RL. But given that RT=9 and RL=5, which would require LT to be imaginary. Therefore, this suggests that the given data may be incorrect, but since this is a problem presented for solving, there must be a way around it. 

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me check once more. If the right angle is at T, then RT and LT are perpendicular. So triangle RTL is right-angled at T. Therefore, by Pythagoras, RT² + LT² = RL². Substituting the known values: 9² + LT² = 5² → 81 + LT² = 25 → LT² = -56. Still impossible. So there's a contradiction. 

But since this is a problem meant to be solved, perhaps I misunderstood which lines are involved. Let me look at the other given information. There's also a triangle RLS, with points R, L, S. Lines RL, LS, RS. Also, the line LW is present, and WS is 6. Additionally, there's a right angle at Angle(L,W,S), which is the angle at W between lines LW and WS. Also, Perpendicular(Line(L,W), Line(W,S)), confirming that right angle at W. 

Perhaps I need to consider multiple triangles and use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the points to see if that helps. Let's place point R at the origin (0,0). Then, since there's a right angle at T between RT and LT, maybe we can position points accordingly. 

Assume R is at (0,0). Let me suppose that RT is along the y-axis and LT is along the x-axis, since they are perpendicular. So if the right angle is at T, then T is the intersection point of RT and LT. Wait, but how do these lines connect? Let me think. 

If RT is a vertical line from R(0,0) up to T(0, b), and LT is horizontal from L(a, 0) to T(0, b)? Wait, that might not work. Wait, the line RT goes from R to T, and line LT goes from L to T. So T is a common point. So if I set T at (0, b), R at (0,0), then LT would be from L(x, y) to T(0, b), and RT is from R(0,0) to T(0,b). Then, since RT and LT are perpendicular, the slope of RT is undefined (vertical line), and the slope of LT would need to be zero (horizontal) to be perpendicular. So LT would be horizontal, implying that L has the same y-coordinate as T. So T is at (0, b), L is at (c, b), so that LT is horizontal. Then, the distance RT is from (0,0) to (0,b): length is |b| = 9, so b=9. Then, RL is the distance from R(0,0) to L(c, b). Given that RL=5, so sqrt((c)^2 + (b)^2) = 5. But since b=9, then c² + 81 = 25 → c² = -56. Again, impossible. Same contradiction as before. 

This suggests that with RT=9 and RL=5, there's no real solution. But since the problem exists, there must be a way. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me reconsider the configuration. Maybe the right angle is not between RT and LT, but between other lines? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(L,T), Line(R,T)), which means that lines LT and RT are perpendicular. So that's the right angle at T. So the previous analysis holds. 

Wait, maybe the triangle RTL is not a right triangle? But the predicate says it is. Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths are not for the sides of the triangle? For instance, maybe the length of RL is not the side of the triangle, but something else. But according to the given predicates, Line(R,L) is part of Triangle(R,L,T), so it should be a side. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to focus on the other parts of the problem. Let's look at the other given information. There's a right angle at Angle(L,W,S), which is the angle at W between lines LW and WS. Also, WS=6. So triangle LWS is a right triangle at W. So LW and WS are perpendicular. 

Additionally, there's a line RS connecting R to S, and line LW connecting L to W. Also, line WS connects W to S. 

Maybe I can use coordinates for these points. Let me try assigning coordinates again, focusing on the right triangle at W. Let me assume point W is at (a, b), and since WS=6 and LW is perpendicular to WS. Let me define coordinates for these points. 

Let me first handle the right triangle at W. Suppose point W is at (x, y), and since WS=6, and the line WS is one leg, and LW is the other leg. Let me assume that WS is along the x-axis from W to S. So if W is at (p, q), then S would be at (p+6, q), assuming WS is horizontal. Then, LW is perpendicular to WS, so LW would be vertical. Thus, point L would be somewhere along the vertical line passing through W. 

But I also have point L connected to R via RL=5, and RT=9. Maybe I can combine these. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that there are two right triangles: one at T (RTL) and one at W (LWS). But the RTL triangle is problematic due to the earlier contradiction. Perhaps there's a different approach. 

Wait, maybe the given RL=5 is not the hypotenuse of the RTL triangle. What if RL is one of the legs? For example, if the right angle is at L, then RL and LT would be legs, and RT the hypotenuse. But the angle is at T, so that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at R? But the angle given is at T. 

I'm stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the other information. Let's assume that despite the contradiction, there's a way to compute RW using other relations. 

We need to find RW. Points R, L, W. So RW is the distance between R and W. 

Given that there are lines RW, LW, and WS=6. Also, there's a triangle RLS with points R, L, S. And line RS. 

Let me consider triangle RLS. It has sides RL=5, LS, and RS. Also, the line LW connects L to W, and WS=6. 

Since there's a right angle at W between LW and WS, which are perpendicular. So LW ⊥ WS. Therefore, triangle LWS is a right triangle at W, with WS=6 and LW as another leg. 

If I can find the coordinates of these points, I could calculate RW. Let me try to assign coordinates again, possibly ignoring the RTL issue temporarily. 

Let me place point R at (0,0). Assume that line RT is vertical, and line LT is horizontal, forming a right angle at T. Let me say T is at (0,9), since RT=9. Then, since LT is horizontal, point L would be at (x, 9), such that the distance from L to T is some value. But RL is the distance from R(0,0) to L(x,9), which is sqrt(x² + 9²) = 5. Solving: x² + 81 = 25 → x² = -56. Again, impossible. So this approach fails. 

Alternative idea: Maybe the right angle at T is not between RT and LT, but between other lines? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(L,T), Line(R,T)), which means those two lines are perpendicular. So they meet at T, and form a right angle. So that's confirmed. 

Therefore, the problem as stated contains a contradiction in the RTL triangle. But since this is a problem given for solving, perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me check if there's another way to interpret the given lines. 

Wait, the lines include RW. So RW is a separate line from R to W. We need to find its length. Maybe the key lies in relating RW with other known quantities through the triangles or using coordinates. 

Let me try to assign coordinates again, accepting that there might be a mistake in the problem. Let me ignore the RTL triangle for a moment and focus on the other elements. 

Suppose I place point R at (0,0). Let me assume that line RT is along the y-axis, so T is at (0,9). Now, line LT is perpendicular to RT, so it's horizontal. Let me assume that L is at (a,9), so that LT is horizontal from L(a,9) to T(0,9). Then, the distance from R(0,0) to L(a,9) is sqrt(a² + 9²) = RL=5. So a² + 81 = 25 → a² = -56. Still impossible. 

But if I allow complex numbers, this would work, but that's not practical. Therefore, there must be a different configuration. Maybe the right angle is not between RT and LT, but between other lines? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(L,T), Line(R,T)), which are the lines LT and RT. So they must be perpendicular. 

Another idea: Perhaps the triangle RTL is not a right triangle? But the predicate says it is. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not for the entire line segments but for projections or something else? Unlikely. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the RTL triangle's inconsistency. Let me try to move to the other part involving the right angle at W. 

There's a right angle at W between LW and WS, with WS=6. Let me assume point W is at (p, q), and point S is at (p+6, q) since WS=6 and assuming it's horizontal. Then, LW is perpendicular to WS, so LW is vertical. Therefore, point L is directly above or below W on the vertical line through W. Let me say L is at (p, q + k), so that LW has length |k|. 

Now, we also have point R connected to L and to W. We need to relate these points. 

Also, there's a triangle RLS with points R, L, S. So RS is a line from R to S, and LS is from L to S. 

Assuming R is at (0,0), and S is at (p+6, q). Point L is at (p, q + k). Then, RL is the distance from (0,0) to (p, q+k), which is sqrt(p² + (q + k)^2) = 5. 

Also, RT is the distance from R(0,0) to T, which is 9. But where is T? Earlier, we had issues with T's position. 

Alternatively, since there's a triangle RTL, and we know RT=9, maybe we can find T's coordinates. But without resolving the RTL triangle issue, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe I need to consider that the given lengths are for different triangles. For example, the triangle RTL might have RL=5, RT=9, and LT=sqrt(9² -5²)=sqrt(81-25)=sqrt(56). But that would imply that the right angle is at L, not T. But the angle is said to be at T. 

Wait, if the right angle were at L, then RT would be the hypotenuse. So RT² = RL² + LT². Given RT=9, RL=5, then LT² = 81 -25 = 56 → LT = sqrt(56). But the angle is said to be at T, so this contradicts. 

But if the problem statement has a mistake, and the right angle is actually at L, then this would make sense. Maybe there was a typo in the problem. Assuming that, let's proceed. 

Assume the right angle is at L, making RT the hypotenuse. Then, RL=5, LT=√(RT² - RL²) = √(81-25) = √56. Then, we could find coordinates for T. Let me try this. 

Let me place point L at (0,0). Then, since the right angle is at L, RT is the hypotenuse. Let me assume that RL is along the x-axis from L(0,0) to R(5,0). Then, LT is along the y-axis from L(0,0) to T(0, √56). Then, point T is at (0, √56). 

Then, line RT goes from R(5,0) to T(0, √56). The length of RT would be sqrt((5)^2 + (√56)^2) = sqrt(25 + 56) = sqrt(81) = 9, which matches the given RT=9. Great! This resolves the earlier contradiction. So the right angle must be at L, not T. But the original predicate says RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)), which is the angle at T. This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it. 

Wait, the angle is Angle(R,T,L), which means the vertex is T. So the angle at T between R-T-L. But in this scenario, the right angle is at L. This doesn't align. So there's still a contradiction. 

Unless the angle at T is not the right angle, but the problem says it is. This is very confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at R? Let me check. If the right angle is at R, then RL and RT would be the legs, and LT the hypotenuse. Then, LT² = RL² + RT² → LT = sqrt(5² + 9²) = sqrt(106). But the angle is at T, so this is not applicable. 

This suggests that the problem as given has inconsistencies, but since it's a problem to solve, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angle. Let me recheck the predicate: RightAngle(Angle(R,T,L)). The angle at T, between R-T-L. So the angle at T is between segments TR and TL. So the lines TR and TL are perpendicular. 

In the scenario where the right angle is at L, the lines LR and LT would be perpendicular, not TR and TL. So that's not matching. 

Wait, in the previous scenario where the right angle is at L, the lines LR and LT are perpendicular. But the angle in the predicate is at T, so it's between TR and TL. These are not the same as LR and LT. 

Thus, this approach doesn't satisfy the given angle condition. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction in the RTL triangle. Perhaps there's a different approach. Let me focus on finding RW using other information. 

We know WS=6, and there's a right angle at W between LW and WS. Let me assume that point W is at (0,0), S is at (6,0), since WS=6. Then, LW is perpendicular to WS, so LW is vertical. So point L is at (0, k) for some k. 

Now, we need to relate this to point R. We know RL=5 and RT=9. Let me assume that R is at (a, b). Then, the distance from R to L(0,k) is 5: sqrt((a-0)^2 + (b-k)^2) = 5 → a² + (b-k)^2 = 25. 

Also, the distance from R to T is 9. But where is T? If T is part of the right triangle RTL with right angle at T, but we don't know its position yet. 

Alternatively, since there's a triangle RLS, which includes points R, L, S. S is at (6,0), L is at (0,k). So RS is the line from R(a,b) to S(6,0), and LS is from L(0,k) to S(6,0). 

Also, there's a line RW connecting R(a,b) to W(0,0). So RW is the distance from R(a,b) to W(0,0): sqrt(a² + b²). We need to find this value. 

But how to find a and b? We have RL=5: a² + (b-k)^2 = 25. And RT=9, but T's position is unclear. 

However, there's a triangle RTL with right angle at T, and RT=9. Let me assume that T is some point, and try to relate it. 

But without knowing where T is, this is difficult. Perhaps there's a relation between T and other points? 

Alternatively, maybe T is related to the other right triangle at W. Not sure. 

This seems too vague. Let me try to think differently. Since we have two right triangles: one at T (RTL) and one at W (LWS). Let me try to use the Pythagorean theorem on both, even though there's a contradiction in the first. 

For the triangle RTL with right angle at T: RT=9, LT=?, RL=5. As before, this gives LT² = 5² -9² = negative. But if I pretend it's positive, LT = sqrt(56). Let's proceed. 

Then, for triangle LWS with right angle at W: LW=?, WS=6, LS=?. Let's say LW is some value, say m. Then, LS² = LW² + WS² = m² + 36. 

Now, looking at triangle RLS, which includes points R, L, S. We know RL=5, LS= sqrt(m² + 36), and RS is another side. But without knowing RS or other relations, it's hard to proceed. 

But there's also line RW, which connects R to W. If I can express RW in terms of other variables. 

Assuming point W is at (0,0), S at (6,0), L at (0, m) (since LW is vertical from W(0,0) to L(0,m), making LW=m and WS=6). Then, point L is at (0, m). 

Now, RL is the distance from R(a,b) to L(0,m): sqrt(a² + (b-m)^2) = 5. 

Also, RT is the distance from R(a,b) to T. But where is T? From the right triangle RTL, which has RT=9, LT= sqrt(56), and RL=5. 

If T is part of this triangle, then T must be positioned such that RT=9 and LT= sqrt(56). Let me assume T is at (x,y). Then, RT distance from R(a,b) to T(x,y) is 9: sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2) = 9. 

And LT distance from L(0,m) to T(x,y) is sqrt(56): sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-m)^2) = sqrt(56). 

Additionally, since the right angle is at T, vectors TR and TL are perpendicular. Vector TR is (a-x, b-y), vector TL is (-x, m-y). Their dot product should be zero: (a-x)(-x) + (b-y)(m-y) = 0. 

But this introduces too many variables: a, b, x, y, m. Too many unknowns. 

However, we also have the line RS, which connects R(a,b) to S(6,0). And line LW is from L(0,m) to W(0,0), which is already defined. 

Additionally, there's a line RW from R(a,b) to W(0,0), whose length is sqrt(a² + b²), which is what we need to find. 

But without more constraints, it's impossible to determine a and b. 

Wait, but there's also the triangle RLS. Let's consider that. Points R(a,b), L(0,m), S(6,0). The distance RL=5, LS= sqrt( (6-0)^2 + (0 - m)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + m²). And RS is the distance from R(a,b) to S(6,0): sqrt( (6-a)^2 + (0 - b)^2 ). 

But we don't know RS. However, there might be a relationship between these. 

But this seems too open-ended. Let me think if there's another way. 

Since we have two right triangles, RTL and LWS, maybe we can use similarity or other properties. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that RW is the hypotenuse of a right triangle involving RW and some other segment. 

Wait, if I consider the coordinates where W is at (0,0), S at (6,0), L at (0, m). Then, RW is from R(a,b) to W(0,0). Also, RL is from R(a,b) to L(0,m) with length 5. 

So, from R(a,b) to L(0,m): a² + (b - m)^2 = 25. 

Also, RT=9, but we don't know T's location. However, there's a line LW from L(0,m) to W(0,0), and line RT from R(a,b) to T. 

But without knowing T's position, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, perhaps T is related to S? Or is there another constraint? 

This seems too vague. Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should consider that the initial contradiction indicates that the right angle is at L, and the problem statement has a typo. If I proceed under that assumption, let's see. 

Assume the right angle is at L in triangle RTL. So RL and LT are perpendicular. Then, RT is the hypotenuse. So RT² = RL² + LT² → 9² = 5² + LT² → LT² = 81 - 25 = 56 → LT = sqrt(56). 

Now, with this, let's assign coordinates. Let me place point L at (0,0). RL is 5 units, and since it's perpendicular to LT, let me place R at (5,0) and T at (0, sqrt(56)). 

Now, point W is part of the other right triangle at W. Let me assume point W is at (0,0) for simplicity, but that conflicts with L being at (0,0). So let me adjust. Let me place L at (0,0), R at (5,0), T at (0, sqrt(56)). Now, the line LW is part of the right triangle at W. Let me assume W is at (0, k), so that LW is from L(0,0) to W(0,k), making LW vertical. Then, WS=6, and since it's perpendicular to LW, WS is horizontal. So S is at (6, k). 

Now, we have point S at (6, k). Also, there's a line RS connecting R(5,0) to S(6,k). The length of RS can be computed, but we don't have info on it. 

But we also have line RW, which connects R(5,0) to W(0,k). The length of RW is sqrt((5-0)^2 + (0 - k)^2) = sqrt(25 + k²). 

Our goal is to find RW, which depends on k. To find k, we need more information. 

What other information do we have? The line LW is from L(0,0) to W(0,k), and WS is from W(0,k) to S(6,k). Also, there's a line RS from R(5,0) to S(6,k). 

Additionally, there's a triangle RLS, which includes points R(5,0), L(0,0), S(6,k). Let's compute the lengths of RL, LS, and RS. 

RL is 5, as given. LS is from L(0,0) to S(6,k): sqrt(6² + k²) = sqrt(36 + k²). RS is from R(5,0) to S(6,k): sqrt((6-5)^2 + (k-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + k²). 

Now, there's also a line RS, and line RW. But how does this help? 

Wait, the problem also mentions a line RW, which is from R(5,0) to W(0,k), and we need to find its length. 

But how to determine k? We need another equation. Let's see if there are other relationships. 

The line LT is from L(0,0) to T(0, sqrt(56)), which is vertical. The line RT is from R(5,0) to T(0, sqrt(56)). We also have a line RW from R(5,0) to W(0,k). Are there any other conditions? 

The problem states that there is a line RW, and that there's a line RS. Also, there's a triangle RLS. But I don't see a direct way to find k. 

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between the triangles or other lines. For example, maybe line RS is related to other lines? 

Alternatively, maybe the line LW is connected to other elements. But I don't have enough information. 

Wait, the problem also includes a line LW, which we've placed as vertical from L(0,0) to W(0,k). And WS=6, which is from W(0,k) to S(6,k). 

So, the length of WS is 6, which is consistent with the x-distance from W(0,k) to S(6,k) being 6. 

Now, if we can relate k to other elements, perhaps through triangle RLS or other lines. 

Let me consider triangle RLS. It has points R(5,0), L(0,0), S(6,k). We know RL=5, LS= sqrt(36 + k²), RS= sqrt(1 + k²). 

But without additional information, we can't determine k. 

However, there's also the line RW, which is from R(5,0) to W(0,k), and we need to find its length, which is sqrt(25 + k²). 

If we can find k, we can compute RW. 

How to find k? Let me think. 

Are there any other given lengths or relationships? The problem states that there's a line RS, but we don't have its length. Also, there's a line RW, but no length given. 

Wait, but there's a line LW from L(0,0) to W(0,k), and WS=6. But LW's length is |k|, since it's vertical from (0,0) to (0,k). 

Is there any other condition that relates k? Let me check all given predicates again. 

The given predicates include Line(R,S), which is from R(5,0) to S(6,k). Also, there's a triangle RLS, which includes this line. 

But without additional information about angles or other lengths, it's still impossible to determine k. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between the triangles RTL and LWS? For example, is there a connection between k and the other elements? 

Alternatively, maybe the line RS is related to the right angle at W? Not directly. 

At this point, I'm unable to determine k with the given information. This suggests that there's missing information or that I'm missing a key insight. 

Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I haven't missed anything. 

The given predicates include: 

- Line(R,S) 
- Triangle(R,L,S)
- IsSideOf(Line(R,L), Triangle(R,L,S))
- IsSideOf(Line(R,S), Triangle(R,L,S))
- IsSideOf(Line(L,S), Triangle(R,L,S))

So triangle RLS has sides RL, LS, RS. We know RL=5, and WS=6, but LS and RS are unknown. 

But there's also line RW, which is from R to W. 

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between RW and other lines through the triangles? 

Alternatively, since W is part of the right triangle LWS, and we have WS=6, and LW is some length, maybe we can express RW in terms of LW and other known quantities. 

From earlier, RW = sqrt(25 + k²), where k is the length of LW. 

But LW is the length from L(0,0) to W(0,k), which is |k|. So LW = |k|. 

If I can find LW, then I can find RW. 

But how to find LW? 

Wait, there's a line LW and a line WS, and they are perpendicular. But I don't see a direct link to other elements. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the triangles RTL and LWS through point S? 

Point S is part of both triangle RLS and the line WS. 

In our current setup, S is at (6,k), and WS=6. 

But without more information about S's position relative to other points, I can't determine k. 

This suggests that there's insufficient information, but since the problem provides answer choices, there must be a way. 

Let me consider that the length RW is requested, and the options are 5.4, 6, 6.6, 7.5. These are decimal values, suggesting that it's a rational number. 

Let me assume that RW is 6.6, which is 33/5, or 6.6 = 33/5. Let me see if that fits. 

If RW = 6.6, then sqrt(25 + k²) = 6.6 → 25 + k² = 43.56 → k² = 18.56 → k = sqrt(18.56) ≈ 4.308. 

Not sure if this helps. 

Alternatively, if RW is 6, then sqrt(25 + k²) = 6 → 25 + k² = 36 → k² = 11 → k = sqrt(11) ≈ 3.316. 

If RW is 5.4, then 25 + k² = 5.4² = 29.16 → k² = 4.16 → k ≈ 2.04. 

If RW is 7.5, then 25 + k² = 56.25 → k² = 31.25 → k = 5.59. 

None of these seem to provide a clear path. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between the triangles RTL and LWS through the coordinates. 

In our setup, T is at (0, sqrt(56)), and S is at (6,k). Is there a relationship between T and S? Not directly given. 

Alternatively, perhaps line RT is related to line RS? 

Line RT goes from R(5,0) to T(0, sqrt(56)), and line RS goes from R(5,0) to S(6,k). Are these lines related? 

The slope of RT is (sqrt(56) - 0)/(0 - 5) = -sqrt(56)/5. 

The slope of RS is (k - 0)/(6 - 5) = k/1 = k. 

No direct relation unless there's a given condition. 

This is getting too speculative. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the answer choices. 

If I assume that the right angle at T is correct, and there's a calculation error, perhaps using the Law of Cosines or something else. 

But previously, with the RTL triangle having RL=5, RT=9, and right angle at T, leading to an impossible scenario, but if I ignore the contradiction and proceed, let's say that LT = sqrt(9² - 5²) = sqrt(56), and then use that in some way. 

Then, in the triangle LWS, which is right-angled at W, with WS=6, and LW = sqrt(56). Then, LS = sqrt(LW² + WS²) = sqrt(56 + 36) = sqrt(92) = 2*sqrt(23). 

Now, in triangle RLS, we have RL=5, LS=2√23, and RS is some value. Using the Law of Cosines: RS² = RL² + LS² - 2*RL*LS*cos(angle at L). But without knowing the angle, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if we assume that RS is related to RW, but I don't see the connection. 

Alternatively, if RW is part of a right triangle with other sides. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the answer choices include 6.6, which is 33/5, and 5.4 is 27/5, and 7.5 is 15/2, I might recall that in some cases, similar triangles or ratios could give these values. 

If I assume that RW is 6.6, which is 33/5, and given that WS=6, maybe there's a ratio of 11:10 or something. 

Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem with 5 and 6: 5-12-13 triangle, but not directly applicable. 

Wait, if I consider the triangle formed by RW, WL, and WL + WS? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since WS=6 and RW is to be found, and there's a right triangle at W, maybe RW is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg WS=6 and other leg LW. If I can find LW, then RW = sqrt(LW² + 6²). 

But how to find LW? 

If I go back to the earlier scenario where the right angle is at L, and T is at (0, sqrt(56)), then LW is a vertical line from L(0,0) to W(0,k). If there's a relationship between T and W, but I don't see it. 

Alternatively, maybe line TW is related to other lines. 

Without further information, I'm forced to guess. Given that the answer choices include 6.6, which is 33/5, and if I assume that RW is 33/5, then the answer is C. 

But this is just a guess. Alternatively, if I consider that RW is the geometric mean of RL and WS, which is sqrt(5*6) = sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477, close to 5.4, which is option A. 

Or, if it's a 3-4-5 triangle scaled, but not sure. 

Given that the answer choices include 5.4 (option A), 6.6 (option C), and others, and considering that in the RTL triangle, if we ignore the contradiction and use RT=9, RL=5, then LT = sqrt(9² - 5²) = sqrt(56), and in the LWS triangle, with WS=6, then LW = ? If there's a relationship between LT and LW, like LT = LW, then LW = sqrt(56), and RW would be sqrt(LW² + WS²) = sqrt(56 + 36) = sqrt(92) ≈ 9.59, which is not among the choices. 

Alternatively, if LW is 6, then RW would be sqrt(6² + 6²) = sqrt(72) ≈ 8.485, not in choices. 

Alternatively, if LW is 5, then RW = sqrt(5² + 6²) = sqrt(61) ≈ 7.81, not in choices. 

If LW is 4, then RW = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52) ≈ 7.21, not in choices. 

If LW is 3, RW = sqrt(9 + 36) =
