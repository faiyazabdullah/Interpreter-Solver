MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines defined here. Let me start by listing out all the given information to get a clear picture.

First, there are points H, F, G, C, B, D, E, I. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(H,C), Line(F,C), Line(G,C), Line(C,B), Line(D,C), Line(E,C). So point C seems to be connected to multiple other points—H, F, G, B, D, E. That suggests that C is a common vertex where several lines meet. 

Then there are some angles mentioned. Angle(H,C,G) and Angle(F,C,B) are both right angles. Also, Angle(D,C,E) has a measure of 157 degrees. Additionally, there's a perpendicular relationship between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G), and another between Line(F,C) and Line(C,B). Also, the measures of Angle(H,C,G) and Angle(F,C,B) are both 90 degrees, confirming they're right angles.

The question asks for the measure of angle 1. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which angle is labeled as 1. Hmm. Maybe angle 1 refers to one of these angles? Or perhaps it's referring to an angle formed by intersecting lines at point C? Since the options are given, maybe we need to deduce which angle is being asked based on the given info.

Let me visualize this. Point C is connected to H, F, G, B, D, E. So imagine point C with six lines coming out of it. Each of those lines forms angles at C. The angles mentioned are HCG, FCB, DCE. Let me note down each angle:

- Angle HCG is a right angle (90°).
- Angle FCB is also a right angle (90°).
- Angle DCE is 157°.

Also, there's a perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G). Wait, Line(H,G) is a line connecting H and G. But Line(C,G) connects C and G. Since they are perpendicular, that means the lines HG and CG form a right angle. Similarly, Line(F,C) and Line(C,B) are perpendicular, so FC and CB form a right angle. 

Wait, but Line(F,C) is already part of the angle FCB, which is a right angle. So that checks out. Because if FC and CB are perpendicular, then angle FCB is 90°, which matches the given.

Now, looking at the angles around point C. Since multiple lines emanate from C, the sum of all angles around point C should add up to 360 degrees. However, since there are multiple angles, we need to see how they relate.

But first, let's think about the angles at point C. The lines from C go to H, F, G, B, D, E. So, each pair of adjacent lines would form an angle. For example, the angle between HC and FC, FC and GC, GC and BC, BC and DC, DC and EC, EC and HC? Not sure about the order, but perhaps the angles given are specific ones.

Given that angle HCG is 90°, which would be between HC and GC. Similarly, angle FCB is 90°, between FC and BC. And angle DCE is 157°, between DC and EC. Also, there's a mention of angle HCF being something? Wait, wait, the predicates say Angle(H,C,F) exists. Wait, let me check again:

Original predicates include:

- Angle(H,C,G)
- Angle(F,C,B)
- Angle(D,C,E)
- Angle(H,C,F)

So, angle HCF is mentioned. Wait, but earlier, we had angle HCG and angle FCB as right angles. Also, angle HCF could be another angle at point C. Let me clarify.

At point C, the lines are going to H, F, G, B, D, E. So, the angles between these lines. For instance:

- Between HC and FC: angle HCF
- Between FC and GC: angle FCG?
Wait, but the given angle HCG is between HC and GC. So, that angle is formed by HC and GC. Which would mean that between HC and GC, there's a 90° angle. Similarly, angle FCB is between FC and BC, which is 90°. Also, angle DCE is between DC and EC, which is 157°. 

Additionally, there's a perpendicular relation between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G). So, line HG is perpendicular to line CG. Since line CG is connected to point C, that implies that angle between HG and CG is 90°, which would be at point G. Wait, but that's a different location. Wait, line HG connects H and G, and line CG connects C and G. So, they intersect at point G. Therefore, the angle between HG and CG at point G is 90°, making triangle HGC a right triangle with right angle at G. 

Similarly, Line(F,C) and Line(C,B) are perpendicular, so angle at C between FC and BC is 90°, which is angle FCB, matching the given.

So, back to the angles at point C. Let's consider the angles formed by the lines from C. There are multiple angles here. The total around point C should sum to 360°. Let's list the angles we know:

1. Angle HCG = 90° (between HC and GC)
2. Angle FCB = 90° (between FC and BC)
3. Angle DCE = 157° (between DC and EC)

But there are more angles because there are more lines from C. The lines are HC, FC, GC, BC, DC, EC. So, the angles between consecutive lines. Assuming the order around point C is such that these lines are arranged in a certain way. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, perhaps there are other angles we can calculate.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 refers to angle HCF. Let me think. If angle HCF is formed between HC and FC, which are two lines from C. Given that angle HCG is between HC and GC, and angle FCB is between FC and BC. Also, considering the perpendicularity between HG and CG, which may affect the angles at C.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 refers to angle HCF. Let's explore that possibility. Suppose angle HCF is the angle between HC and FC. How can we find its measure?

To find angle HCF, we need to consider the arrangement of lines at point C. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram mentally.

Starting with point C. From C, lines go to H, F, G, B, D, E. Now, angle HCG is 90°, so HC and GC form a right angle. Similarly, FC and BC form a right angle. Also, DC and EC form an angle of 157°. Now, if we can figure out how these lines are arranged around point C, we can compute the remaining angles.

Assuming that the lines are arranged in order around point C. Let me assume that the lines are ordered as follows: starting from HC, going clockwise, then FC, then GC, then BC, then DC, then EC, and back to HC. But this is just a guess. Alternatively, the order might vary depending on the actual configuration.

But given that angle HCG is between HC and GC, and angle FCB is between FC and BC, perhaps the order is such that HC, then FC, then GC, then BC, then DC, then EC. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, since angle DCE is between DC and EC, which is 157°, and angle HCG and angle FCB are 90°, maybe there are other angles that can be determined.

Another approach: consider that the sum of angles around point C is 360°. So, if we can identify all the angles around C, we can find missing ones.

We know three angles:

1. Angle HCG = 90°
2. Angle FCB = 90°
3. Angle DCE = 157°

But there are more angles because there are more lines. For example, between HC and FC, there's angle HCF; between GC and BC, there's angle GCB (which is same as angle FCB? No, angle FCB is between FC and BC. So, maybe between GC and BC, there's another angle? Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the lines from C are arranged in such a way that the angles between them add up. Let me try to count the number of angles around C. With six lines from C, there are six angles between adjacent lines. However, the given angles are three of them. The others would be:

Between HC and FC: angle HCF

Between FC and GC: angle FCG

Between GC and BC: angle GCB

Between BC and DC: angle BCD

Between DC and EC: angle DCE = 157°

Between EC and HC: angle ECH

But we don't know these angles yet. However, we do know some of the angles. For example, angle HCG is between HC and GC, which would be the angle between HC and GC. If the lines are ordered as HC, then FC, then GC, then BC, then DC, then EC, then back to HC, then angle HCG would be between HC and GC, which would span over FC. Wait, but angle HCG is specifically between HC and GC, implying that the lines HC and GC are adjacent? Or not necessarily.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps there's another way. Let's consider that the lines from C are forming various angles, and some of them are right angles. Also, there's the angle DCE of 157°, which is quite large. Let me think about the total angles.

Suppose that the angles around point C are:

- Angle HCF (unknown)
- Angle FCG (unknown)
- Angle GCB (which is part of angle FCB? Wait, angle FCB is 90°, which is between FC and BC. So angle GCB would be the same as angle FCB if GC and BC are adjacent? Not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider that angle HCG is between HC and GC, which is 90°, and angle FCB is between FC and BC, which is 90°, and angle DCE is between DC and EC, which is 157°. These three angles are separate. Are there other angles that need to be considered?

Wait, if we look at the lines from C:

HC, FC, GC, BC, DC, EC. These are six lines from point C. Thus, there are six angles around point C. However, the given angles are three of them:

1. Angle HCG (between HC and GC): 90°
2. Angle FCB (between FC and BC): 90°
3. Angle DCE (between DC and EC): 157°

But there are three more angles to account for. Those would be:

a. Between GC and BC: let's call this angle GCB
b. Between BC and DC: angle BCD
c. Between EC and HC: angle ECH

Wait, but if we assume that the lines are arranged in order HC, FC, GC, BC, DC, EC, then the angles would be:

- Between HC and FC: angle HCF
- Between FC and GC: angle FCG
- Between GC and BC: angle GCB
- Between BC and DC: angle BCD
- Between DC and EC: angle DCE = 157°
- Between EC and HC: angle ECH

However, we also have the angle HCG which is between HC and GC. This angle spans across the lines HC, FC, and GC. Wait, if the lines are ordered HC, FC, GC, then the angle between HC and GC would be the sum of angle HCF + angle FCG. Similarly, angle HCG is given as 90°, so HCF + FCG = 90°.

Similarly, angle FCB is between FC and BC, which is 90°, so that would be angle FCB = 90°. Also, angle DCE is between DC and EC, which is 157°.

But how does this help us? We need to find angle 1. Assuming angle 1 is one of these angles. Let's suppose that angle 1 is angle HCF. To find that, we need more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram includes other relationships. For example, the perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G). Since Line(H,G) is from H to G, and Line(C,G) is from C to G. They are perpendicular, so at point G, the lines HG and CG form a right angle. This implies that triangle HGC is a right triangle with right angle at G. So, in triangle HGC, angle at G is 90°, so the other two angles (at H and C) must add up to 90°. However, angle at C in triangle HGC would be angle HCG, which is given as 90°, but that contradicts unless... Wait, no. Wait, triangle HGC has vertices H, G, C. The right angle is at G, so angle at G is 90°, and the other two angles are at H and C. The sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so angle HGC (right angle) plus angles at H and C equals 180°. So angle at C (which is angle HCG?) Wait, angle at C in triangle HGC is angle HCG. Wait, but angle HCG was given as 90°, which would make the other angles sum to 90°, but that's impossible because angle HCG is already 90°, making the other angles sum to 90°, which would require each to be less than 90°. But this seems conflicting. Wait, this suggests that angle HCG cannot be 90° if triangle HGC is right-angled at G. Unless there's a mistake here.

Wait, the given says that Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(C,G)). So lines HG and CG are perpendicular. Therefore, at point G, the angle between HG and CG is 90°, which is angle HGC (in triangle HGC). Therefore, in triangle HGC, angle at G is 90°, and angle at C is angle HCG. But according to the given, angle HCG is 90°, which would make triangle HGC have two right angles at G and C, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(C,G)). This means that the lines HG and CG are perpendicular. So, the angle between lines HG and CG is 90°, which occurs at point G. So, the angle between HG and CG is at G, not at C. Therefore, in triangle HGC, the right angle is at G. Therefore, angle at G is 90°, and the other two angles (at H and C) must add up to 90°. But angle at C in triangle HGC is angle HCG, which is given as 90°, which would imply that angle HCG is 90°, leading to a contradiction. Hence, there's a conflict here.

Wait, this suggests that there's an error in my interpretation. Let me double-check. The given states:

Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(C,G)).

Which means that the two lines HG and CG are perpendicular. So, they meet at point G and form a right angle there. Therefore, the angle between HG and CG at point G is 90°, which is angle HGC. This is different from angle HCG, which is at point C between HC and GC. So angle HCG is at point C, while angle HGC is at point G. So angle HCG is not part of triangle HGC. Instead, triangle HGC has angles at H, G, and C. At G, the right angle, and at C, angle HCG, which is part of the diagram. But if angle HCG is given as 90°, that would mean that triangle HGC has angles at G (90°), at C (also 90°), and at H (0°), which is impossible. Hence, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, this indicates that my previous assumption is wrong. Let me re-express. The given says that angle HCG is a right angle. Wait, no. Wait, the given includes:

Angle(H,C,G) → which is the angle at point C between HC and GC. So that is angle HCG. And this is stated as RightAngle(Angle(H,C,G)), so angle HCG is 90°. But at the same time, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(C,G)), which creates a right angle at point G between lines HG and CG. So, how can both be true?

Ah! Here's the key. The angle at C (HCG) is 90°, and the angle at G (HGC) is 90°, but they are different angles. In triangle HGC, we have two right angles at G and C, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, this must mean that I'm misinterpreting the angle notation. Let me confirm. In standard notation, Angle(H,C,G) refers to the angle at point C between points H and G. So, yes, that's the angle at C between HC and GC, which is given as 90°. Meanwhile, the perpendicularity between lines HG and CG implies that at point G, the angle between HG and CG is 90°, which is angle HGC (at point G). So, triangle HGC has a right angle at G and at C? That's impossible unless it's a degenerate triangle. So this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the lines HG and CG are not part of the same triangle. Let me think again. Line HG connects points H and G, and line CG connects points C and G. They are perpendicular, so they meet at point G and form a right angle there. However, angle HCG is at point C, between HC and GC. So, those are two different angles. So, in triangle HGC, we have points H, G, C. The sides are HG, GC, and HC. At point G, angle HGC is 90°, and at point C, angle HCG is 90°, which would make the third angle at H equal to 0°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the given conditions are contradictory. But since this is a problem given to solve, there must be a resolution.

Wait, maybe the lines are not forming a triangle? Or perhaps there's an error in assuming that angle HCG is part of triangle HGC? Let me check again. Angle HCG is at point C, between HC and GC. So, if lines HC and GC are connected at point C, and line HG connects H to G, then triangle HGC would have vertices at H, G, and C. So, the angles at H, G, and C. If angle at C is 90°, and angle at G is 90°, then the triangle is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's a contradiction. However, since this is a problem posed, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the lines are not straight? Or perhaps there are multiple lines? Or maybe the angle HCG is not part of triangle HGC. Wait, but angle HCG is at point C, between HC and GC. So, in triangle HGC, the side GC is connected to C, and HC is connected to C. So, the angle at C is between HC and GC, which is angle HCG. So, if that's 90°, and at point G, the angle between HG and GC is 90°, then the triangle HGC would have two right angles, which is impossible. Hence, this is a contradiction, which suggests that my initial assumptions are wrong.

Perhaps the line HG is not directly connected to G? Or maybe there's a different configuration. Wait, the line HG is defined as Line(H,G), which connects H and G. And Line(C,G) connects C and G. So, these two lines intersect at point G, hence forming the right angle there. But then, angle HCG is at point C, which is between HC and GC. So, if both lines HC and GC exist, then angle HCG is at C, and angle HGC is at G. So, triangle HGC has two right angles. This seems impossible, but perhaps the diagram allows for overlapping lines or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not coplanar? But that's unlikely in a typical geometry problem. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I've misunderstood the notation. Let me check again the original predicates.

The given includes:

- Angle(H,C,G) is a right angle.
- Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(C,G)).

So, angle at C is 90°, and lines HG and CG are perpendicular. So, lines HG and CG meet at G and are perpendicular. So, angle at G between HG and CG is 90°. So, triangle HGC has right angle at G, and angle at C is 90°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the problem is inconsistent, but since it's presented as solvable, I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the angle HCG is not part of triangle HGC? Let me think. If angle HCG is at point C between HC and GC, and line HG is another line from H to G, then point G is connected to C via line CG, and to H via line HG. So, triangle HGC has sides HC, CG, and HG. The angle at C is between HC and CG, which is angle HCG = 90°, and the angle at G is between CG and HG, which is 90°, making the third angle at H = 0°, which is impossible. So this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting the angle notation. Alternatively, perhaps the angle HCG is not referring to the internal angle of the triangle but something else? Or maybe the lines are not forming a triangle? 

Alternatively, maybe the lines HC and GC are not connected to form a triangle with HG. Wait, but if you have points H, C, G, then lines HC, CG, and GH form a triangle. So, this is perplexing. 

Since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that despite this apparent contradiction, there is a way to resolve it. Perhaps the angle at C is not part of triangle HGC, but instead, the lines extend beyond, allowing for non-triangle configurations. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle HCG is not the internal angle of triangle HGC. For example, if line HG extends beyond G, but that doesn't change the fact that angle at C is still between HC and GC. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to set aside this contradiction for a moment and focus on other parts of the problem. 

Looking back at the other given angles: Angle(F,C,B) is a right angle, and Angle(D,C,E) is 157°. Also, the lines FC and BC are perpendicular, so angle FCB is 90°. 

Let me consider the angles around point C. If we can find the sum of all angles around C, which is 360°, and we know some of them, maybe we can find others. 

Assume that the lines from C are HC, FC, GC, BC, DC, EC. The angles between these lines are:

- Between HC and FC: let's call this angle α
- Between FC and GC: β
- Between GC and BC: γ
- Between BC and DC: δ
- Between DC and EC: ε = 157°
- Between EC and HC: ζ

So, the sum α + β + γ + δ + ε + ζ = 360°.

We also know that angle HCG (between HC and GC) is 90°. This angle is composed of α + β. So, α + β = 90°.

Similarly, angle FCB (between FC and BC) is 90°, which is β + γ = 90°.

And angle DCE (between DC and EC) is 157°, which is δ + ε = 157°? Or wait, angle DCE is between DC and EC, so that would be δ + ε? Or is it just ε? Let me clarify. If DC and EC are adjacent lines from C, then the angle between DC and EC is ε = 157°. So, if DC and EC are adjacent, then the angle between them is ε = 157°, so δ + ε = ? Wait, no. If DC and EC are two lines from C, then the angle between them is directly ε. So, if DC and EC are adjacent, then the angle between them is ε = 157°. 

But if there are other lines between DC and EC, like BC or something, then it might be part of a larger angle. But assuming that the lines are arranged sequentially, then between DC and EC, there are no other lines. So, the angle between DC and EC is ε = 157°. 

So, we have:

α + β = 90° (from angle HCG)
β + γ = 90° (from angle FCB)
ε = 157° (angle DCE)
And the remaining angles are δ and ζ.

But we also have the equation α + β + γ + δ + ε + ζ = 360°.

Substituting the known values:

From α + β = 90°, and β + γ = 90°, we can express γ = 90° - β.

Substitute into the total sum:

(α + β) + γ + δ + ε + ζ = 90° + (90° - β) + δ + 157° + ζ = 90 + 90 - β + δ + 157 + ζ = 337° - β + δ + ζ.

This should equal 360°, so:

337° - β + δ + ζ = 360° → -β + δ + ζ = 23°.

But we have too many variables here. Need more relations. 

What else is given? The perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G). As previously discussed, this implies that at point G, lines HG and CG are perpendicular. But how does this affect the angles at point C?

Maybe it relates to triangle HGC. Even though earlier it seemed contradictory, perhaps there's a way to use it. Let me try to consider triangle HGC. If angle at G is 90°, and angle at C is 90°, then it's impossible. But if the angle at C is not part of the triangle, then maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at C is not part of the triangle, but the line HG extends beyond G, creating another angle. This is getting too vague. 

Maybe I should focus on the angles around point C. Let's assume that the angle DCE is 157°, and that's one of the angles. Let's also assume that the other angles are related to the right angles. 

If we can find β, since β appears in both equations α + β = 90° and β + γ = 90°, then from these two equations, we can see that α + β = β + γ ⇒ α = γ. 

So, α = γ. 

Also, from the total sum equation: 337° - β + δ + ζ = 360° → -β + δ + ζ = 23°.

But without more information, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but what about the other lines? Like, Line(H,G) and Line(C,G) being perpendicular. If we consider triangle HGC, even though it seems impossible, perhaps we can use trigonometry. Let me assume that angle at C is 90°, and angle at G is 90°, so the third angle at H would be 0°, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. 

But since the problem is given, I must proceed. Perhaps the angle HCG is not 90°, but the predicate says it is. Wait, let me check again. The given includes:

- RightAngle(Angle(H,C,G)) → angle HCG is 90°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,C,G)), 90) → confirms it's 90°

So, it's definitely 90°. And the perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G) → which would mean that at point G, the angle between HG and CG is 90°. So, this is a contradiction. 

Perhaps the issue is that the angle at C is not part of the triangle, but the lines extend in such a way that it's allowed? Or perhaps the lines are not straight? 

This is really confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should try to focus on the other parts of the problem and see if angle 1 can be found indirectly. 

The question is asking for m∠1. The answer choices are 90, 113, 123, 157. 

Given that one of the angles is 157°, which is close to 180°, and the other right angles are 90°. If angle 1 is supplementary to 157°, then it would be 180 - 157 = 23°, which isn't an option. Or if it's part of a linear pair with 157°, but that's not likely. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is part of a triangle with the right angles. For example, if angle 1 is part of a triangle where two angles are 90° and 157°, but that's not possible. 

Wait, let me think differently. Since angle DCE is 157°, which is given. If this angle is part of a larger structure, like a straight line, then the supplement would be 180 - 157 = 23°. But again, not in the choices. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the difference between 180° and 157°, giving 23°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle with angles 90° and 157°, but that's not possible. 

Wait, let's revisit the angles around point C. We had earlier:

α + β = 90° (angle HCG)
β + γ = 90° (angle FCB)
ε = 157° (angle DCE)
Total sum: 360°

So, from α + β = 90° and β + γ = 90°, we get α = γ.

Let me denote β as x. So, α = 90° - x, and γ = 90° - x.

Now, the remaining angles are δ and ζ, and ε = 157°.

So, the total sum is:

α + β + γ + δ + ε + ζ = (90 - x) + x + (90 - x) + δ + 157 + ζ = 90 + 90 - x + δ + 157 + ζ = 337 - x + δ + ζ = 360°.

Thus, -x + δ + ζ = 23°.

But without more information, we can't determine x, δ, or ζ.

However, if we assume that there are no other angles, or that some of these are zero, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but what about the other lines? For example, Line(D,C) and Line(E,C) form angle DCE = 157°, which is one angle. What about the other lines? 

Maybe there are other constraints. For example, the perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G). Let's try to use this. 

As before, lines HG and CG are perpendicular at G. This means that in triangle HGC, if it were a triangle, it would have two right angles, which is impossible. So, perhaps the lines extend in such a way that point G is not part of a triangle, but rather, the lines are extended, and the angle at C is part of a larger structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at C (angle HCG = 90°) is part of a square or rectangle, but without more info, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since angle HCG is 90°, and angle FCB is 90°, and angle DCE is 157°, maybe the remaining angles around C can be calculated. 

If we assume that the lines from C are arranged such that angle DCE is 157°, and the other angles are as computed. But without knowing how many angles there are, it's difficult.

Wait, the lines from C are to H, F, G, B, D, E. So, six lines, creating six angles around C. We know three of them: angle HCG (90°), angle FCB (90°), and angle DCE (157°). The other three angles are between GC and BC, BC and DC, and EC and HC. Wait, no. Let me think:

If the six lines from C are arranged in order as H, F, G, B, D, E, then the angles between them would be:

1. Between H and F: angle HCF
2. Between F and G: angle FCG
3. Between G and B: angle GCB
4. Between B and D: angle BCD
5. Between D and E: angle DCE = 157°
6. Between E and H: angle ECH

So, total of six angles. We know angle DCE = 157°, and angles HCG (between H and G) is 90°, which is the sum of angle HCF + angle FCG = 90°. Similarly, angle FCB (between F and B) is 90°, which is angle FCG + angle GCB = 90°. 

Let me denote:

Let angle HCF = a
Let angle FCG = b
So, a + b = 90° (angle HCG)

Let angle GCB = c
So, b + c = 90° (angle FCB)

Therefore, from these two equations, a + b = b + c => a = c.

So, a = c.

Now, the other angles are:

Between G and B: angle GCB = c = a
Between B and D: angle BCD = d
Between D and E: angle DCE = 157°
Between E and H: angle ECH = e

So, the remaining angles are a (angle GCB), d (BCD), 157°, and e (ECH).

Wait, but also, the total sum of all six angles around C is 360°. So:

a + b + c + d + 157° + e = 360°

But since a = c, and a + b = 90°, and b + c = 90°, so substituting c = a, we have:

a + b + a + d + 157° + e = 360°

But since a + b = 90°, this becomes:

90° + a + d + e + 157° = 360°

So, a + d + e = 360° - 90° - 157° = 113°

So, a + d + e = 113°.

But what else do we know? 

The perpendicularity between Line(H,G) and Line(C,G) implies that at point G, lines HG and CG are perpendicular. Let's consider triangle HGC. If we can find some relationship here. 

In triangle HGC, the angles are at H, G, and C. At G, it's 90°, and at C, it's angle HCG = 90°, which would make the third angle at H = 0°, which is impossible. This suggests that this scenario is impossible, but since the problem is given, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at C is not part of triangle HGC, but the lines extend beyond, and the angle at C is part of another structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not forming a triangle, but extending infinitely, and the angle at C is part of a larger figure. 

Without further information, it's challenging to proceed. However, the problem asks for m∠1, which might be one of the angles we've denoted. For example, if angle 1 is angle HCF (a), or angle BCD (d), or angle ECH (e).

If we assume that angle 1 is one of these angles, and given that a + d + e = 113°, and if we can find any of these angles, we could determine it. 

But how?

Wait, maybe there's another relationship involving the perpendicularity at G. Let's think about triangle HGC. Even though it seems contradictory, perhaps we can use the fact that in such a scenario, the triangle would have to collapse, implying that some of the other angles are related. 

For example, if angle at C is 90°, and angle at G is 90°, then the triangle would have to have a degenerate shape, implying that points H, G, and C are collinear. But that would mean that line HG passes through C, making angle HCG zero, which contradicts the given 90°. 

This is extremely confusing. Given the time I've invested without resolving this contradiction, I'll try to proceed with the information I have. 

If we assume that the sum a + d + e = 113°, and if angle 1 is one of these angles, and given the answer choices, perhaps 113° is one of the options. Looking at the choices: B is 113. 

So, if angle 1 is one of these angles, and the sum a + d + e = 113°, then possibly angle 1 is 113°. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the supplement of 157°, which is 23°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is part of a triangle with the right angles. 

But given the options, and the calculation that a + d + e = 113°, it's plausible that angle 1 is 113°, which is option B. 

Therefore, I'll conclude that the measure of angle 1 is 113°, corresponding to option B.
