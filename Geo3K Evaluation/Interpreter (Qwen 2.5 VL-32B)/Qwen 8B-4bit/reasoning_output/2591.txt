<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a regular pentagon and a square sharing a common vertex X. The sides XY and XZ belong to another regular polygon that also has vertex X. We need to find how many sides this third polygon has.

First, I'll parse the given predicates. There's a Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z), so that means points A, B, C, D, Z form a regular pentagon. Then there's a Square(X,Y,C,B). Wait, a square has four vertices, so X, Y, C, B must be the corners of a square. Also, Point(X), Point(Y), Point(Z), etc., so all these points are defined.

Then there's Regular(Polygon(X,Y,Z)) – wait, but earlier there was a Square(X,Y,C,B) and Pentagon(A,B,C,D,Z). But here it says Regular(Polygon(X,Y,Z))? That seems like a triangle? Because three points would make a triangle. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, the user wrote:

"Regular(Polygon(X, Y, Z))" — yes, that's three points, so a triangle. But then later they mention Angle(X, Y, C), Angle(X, C, B), etc. Hmm, perhaps there's more to the setup.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X. The sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X." So, the square has vertices X, Y, C, B. The pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. So point B is shared between the square and pentagon. Then, the third regular polygon has sides XY and XZ. So, the third polygon has two sides starting at X: one going to Y (from square) and one going to Z (from pentagon). Since it's a regular polygon, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal. So, the third polygon must have sides XY and XZ as adjacent sides, since they start at X. Therefore, the third polygon would have vertices X connected to Y, then Y connected to next vertex, etc., but since XY and XZ are sides of this polygon, X is connected to Y and Z, implying that Y and Z are adjacent vertices in the third polygon. Wait, but if the third polygon is regular, then the angle between XY and XZ should be equal to the internal angle of that polygon. 

But the problem states that the sides XY and XZ are sides of the third regular polygon. So, each side of the third polygon is of length equal to XY and XZ. Since XY is a side of the square, and XZ is a side of the pentagon. Wait, but in a square, all sides are equal, so XY equals XB (since square's sides are equal). Similarly, in the pentagon, XZ would be a side? Wait, no. The pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA? Wait, the pentagon's vertices are A, B, C, D, Z. So the edges are AB, BC, CD, DZ, and ZA. Wait, but where is X in this? The square is X, Y, C, B. So, in the square, the edges are XY, YC, CB, and BX. So, X is connected to Y and B. Wait, but the pentagon includes points A, B, C, D, Z. So, the edge BC connects B and C. Then, in the square, Y is connected to C. So Y is part of the square's side YC. So, in the square, the sides are XY, YC, CB, and BX. So, the square has sides XY, YC, CB, and BX. Thus, XY is a side of the square, so its length is equal to YC, CB, and BX. Similarly, the pentagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So, the pentagon's sides are AB, BC, CD, DZ, and ZA. Now, the problem mentions that the sides XY and XZ are sides of a third regular polygon. Wait, XZ isn't directly mentioned yet. Wait, in the pentagon, point Z is part of the pentagon's vertices. So, in the pentagon, the edges are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So, the edge connecting Z to A is ZA. But where is X in relation to Z? From the square, we have X connected to Y and B. Also, from the pentagon, point Z is connected to D and A. So, the side XZ would be a new segment connecting X to Z. But according to the problem, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ. So, those two segments are sides of a third regular polygon. Therefore, the third polygon has two sides: XY and XZ. Since it's regular, all sides are equal, so XY = XZ. But XY is a side of the square, so its length is equal to the square's side length. XZ is a side of the pentagon? Or is XZ a diagonal? Wait, in the pentagon, the vertices are A, B, C, D, Z. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So, the edge from Z to A is ZA. Is X connected to Z? Not directly unless specified. Wait, the problem says that sides XY and XZ are sides of the third polygon. So, XY is a side of the square (as per square X, Y, C, B), and XZ is a side of the third polygon. Wait, but XZ may not be a side of the pentagon. Wait, the pentagon has Z as one of its vertices, but X is not part of the pentagon's original structure. Unless there's some connection. Wait, the pentagon is A, B, C, D, Z. So, X is outside the pentagon. So, the segment XZ is not necessarily a side of the pentagon. Therefore, XZ is a new segment connecting X to Z. So, the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, meaning that XY and XZ are consecutive sides of the polygon, meeting at X. Therefore, the angle between XY and XZ is the internal angle at vertex X of the third regular polygon. 

Now, the problem gives several angle measures. For example, Angle(X, Y, C) is 90 degrees because it's part of the square. Similarly, Angle(X, C, B) is 90 degrees. Then, other angles involving X, such as Angle(X, B, Z), Angle(X, Z, A), Angle(X, A, D), Angle(X, D, C) are 108 degrees each. And the sum of all those angles is 360 degrees. 

Let me list all the given angles:

From the square: 
- Angle at X between Y and C: ∠X Y C = 90°
- Angle at X between C and B: ∠X C B = 90°

Wait, but the first angle listed is Angle(X, Y, C), which is ∠YXC. Wait, the syntax might be important here. In standard angle notation, Angle(A, B, C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So, ∠AB C is the angle at B between A and C. So, Angle(X, Y, C) is the angle at Y between X and C. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the square. Wait, if the square is X, Y, C, B, then the square's sides are XY, YC, CB, and BX. So, at point Y, the angle between X-Y-C is 90 degrees. Similarly, at point C, the angle between Y-C-B is 90 degrees. However, the given angles are:

Angle(X, Y, C): This would be the angle at Y between X and C. Which is indeed 90 degrees, as part of the square. Similarly, Angle(X, C, B) is the angle at C between X and B, which is also 90 degrees. Then, other angles:

Angle(X, B, Z): This is the angle at B between X and Z. Given as 108 degrees. 

Angle(X, Z, A): Angle at Z between X and A, 108 degrees.

Angle(X, A, D): Angle at A between X and D, 108 degrees.

Angle(X, D, C): Angle at D between X and C, 108 degrees.

And the sum of all these angles is 360 degrees. Wait, the sum is:

MeasureOf(Angle(X, Y, C)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X, C, B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X, B, Z)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X, Z, A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X, A, D)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X, D, C)) = 360 degrees.

So substituting the given values:

90 + 90 + 108 + 108 + 108 + 108 = ?

Calculating:

90 + 90 = 180

Each of the next four terms is 108, so 4*108=432

Total sum: 180 + 432 = 612. Wait, but the problem says this sum equals 360. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the angles. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the problem says SumOf(...) Equals(360). So according to the given data, the sum of those six angles is 360 degrees. But according to my calculation, it's 90+90+108+108+108+108 = 612, which is way more than 360. That suggests I've misunderstood the angles' definitions. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angles.

Wait, maybe the angles are not all around point X. Let me think again. Each angle is at different points. For example, Angle(X, Y, C) is at Y, between X and C. Similarly, Angle(X, C, B) is at C between X and B. Then Angle(X, B, Z) is at B between X and Z. Then Angle(X, Z, A) is at Z between X and A. Angle(X, A, D) is at A between X and D. Angle(X, D, C) is at D between X and C. So, these angles are spread across various points, not all around point X. Therefore, the total sum being 360 degrees might refer to something else. Wait, but the problem states that this sum equals 360. Maybe these angles are arranged around a certain point? Or perhaps there's a loop forming a full rotation? Alternatively, maybe the angles are parts of different polygons contributing to a full circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are the internal angles of different polygons. Wait, but the problem says the sum equals 360. So, perhaps these angles are the internal angles of various polygons adding up to a full circle. But that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe they are the angles around a particular point, but the given angles are not all around the same point. 

This confusion suggests that I need to better visualize the configuration. Let me try to sketch mentally.

We have a square X-Y-C-B-X. So, points X, Y, C, B forming a square. Then, a regular pentagon A-B-C-D-Z-A. So, points A, B, C, D, Z form a regular pentagon. So, point B is shared between the square and the pentagon. So, the square has points X, Y, C, B; the pentagon has points A, B, C, D, Z. Then, the third regular polygon has sides XY and XZ. So, starting at X, going to Y (square side) and to Z (some point). 

Additionally, the problem gives several angles:

At point Y: Angle(X, Y, C) = 90° (which is the internal angle of the square).

At point C: Angle(X, C, B) = 90° (also part of the square).

At point B: Angle(X, B, Z) = 108°. Wait, why is this angle 108°? Since point B is part of both the square and the pentagon. In the square, the angle at B is between X and C (since square has sides XB and BC). But in the pentagon, the angle at B would be between A and C. Wait, in the pentagon, the edges at B are BA and BC. So, the internal angle at B of the pentagon is 108°, since a regular pentagon has internal angles of 108°. However, the angle given here is Angle(X, B, Z), which is the angle at B between X and Z. So, this angle is not the internal angle of the pentagon, but rather an external angle formed by connecting X to Z.

Similarly, other angles are at different points. 

Now, the sum of these six angles is 360°. Let me try to see what each of these angles represents.

Starting with Angle(X, Y, C) = 90°: At point Y, between X and C. This is the angle of the square at Y, which is 90°.

Angle(X, C, B) = 90°: At point C, between X and B. This is the angle of the square at C, which is 90°.

Angle(X, B, Z) = 108°: At point B, between X and Z. Since B is part of the square and the pentagon. In the square, the angle at B is between X and C (which is 90°), but here, the angle is between X and Z. So, Z is a point from the pentagon. Since the pentagon has vertex Z connected to D and A. So, the segment BZ is not part of the pentagon. Wait, but in the pentagon, the points are A, B, C, D, Z. So, the edges are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So, from point B, the pentagon has edges BA and BC. But here, the angle at B between X and Z involves the segment BZ. So, this is an external line from B to Z, creating an angle with XB (the square's side) and BZ.

Similarly, Angle(X, Z, A) is at point Z between X and A. Since Z is a vertex of the pentagon, connected to D and A. So, the segment ZA is part of the pentagon. So, this angle is between XZ and ZA. 

Angle(X, A, D) is at point A between X and D. Since A is part of the pentagon, connected to B and Z. So, the segment AD would be... Wait, in the pentagon, the edges are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. So, from A, the edges go to B and Z. So, the angle at A between X and D would involve the segment XD, which is not part of the pentagon. So, this is an external line from A to D, making an angle with AX and AD.

Similarly, Angle(X, D, C) is at point D between X and C. Point D is part of the pentagon, connected to C and Z. So, the segment DC is part of the pentagon, but XD is an external line from D to X, forming an angle with DC.

Hmm. These angles seem to form a sort of star or polygonal path around different points. However, the sum of all these angles is 360°, which might imply that they form a closed loop or something. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are the exterior angles of some polygon or contribute to the total turning angle when traversing around a path. 

Alternatively, considering that the sum of these angles is 360°, which could represent the total rotation when moving along a path that goes through these angles. 

But regardless, the main goal is to find the number of sides of the third regular polygon whose sides are XY and XZ. 

Since the third polygon is regular, all its internal angles are equal. The angle between XY and XZ is the internal angle at vertex X of this polygon. Let's denote n as the number of sides of this polygon. Then, the formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is ((n-2)/n)*180 degrees. 

But how do we find this angle? It's the angle between XY and XZ. To find this angle, we need to determine the measure of ∠YXZ. 

Looking at the given angles, maybe we can compute ∠YXZ by considering the angles around point X. However, the given angles don't directly give us ∠YXZ. Instead, we have angles at other points. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of the given angles equals 360°. Let's look again at the sum:

Given angles:

∠YXC = 90° (at Y)
∠XCB = 90° (at C)
∠XBC = 108° (at B)
∠XZA = 108° (at Z)
∠XAD = 108° (at A)
∠XDC = 108° (at D)
Total sum = 90 + 90 + 108 + 108 + 108 + 108 = 612°, which contradicts the given that the sum equals 360°. Wait, but the problem says this sum is 360. So there must be a miscalculation here. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not all distinct? Or perhaps I have misinterpreted the angles. Let me check the problem again.

The problem lists:

Angle(X, Y, C) → ∠YXC = 90°
Angle(X, C, B) → ∠XCB = 90°
Angle(X, B, Z) → ∠XBC = 108°
Angle(X, Z, A) → ∠XZA = 108°
Angle(X, A, D) → ∠XAD = 108°
Angle(X, D, C) → ∠XDC = 108°

Wait, but the sum of these is 90 + 90 + 108 + 108 + 108 + 108 = 612°, which is supposed to equal 360°. Clearly, this is impossible, so I must have misread the angles. Perhaps the angles are not all separate, but some are overlapping or part of a larger structure. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not all at different points. Let me consider the possibility that the angles are actually forming a closed polygon or path. For instance, imagine a path that starts at X, goes to Y, then follows the square to C, then follows some path to Z, then to A, then to D, then to C, and finally back to X. But this is just speculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are the external angles of a polygon. Wait, the sum of external angles of any polygon is 360°, but this is for convex polygons. However, the given angles are not necessarily external angles. 

Wait, another thought: since the sum of these angles is 360°, which is the total angle around a point. But these angles are not all around the same point. So this seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are the internal angles of a polygon that wraps around multiple points, leading to a total turn of 360°. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are the ones involved in constructing a star polygon or something similar. 

But given that this is getting too abstract, perhaps I should focus on finding the angle ∠YXZ, which is the internal angle of the third regular polygon. Once I know that angle, I can use the formula for the internal angle of a regular polygon to solve for n.

To find ∠YXZ, note that it's the angle between XY and XZ. To find this angle, we need to consider the directions of XY and XZ relative to each other. 

XY is a side of the square, so it forms a right angle with XC (since it's a square). Wait, in the square X-Y-C-B, XY is perpendicular to YC. So, the direction from X to Y is perpendicular to the direction from Y to C. Similarly, XZ is a side of the third regular polygon. But how is XZ oriented? 

Alternatively, we can analyze the angles at points B, Z, A, D, etc., to find relations. 

Let's consider the angle at point B: ∠XBC = 108°. In the square, the angle at B between X and C is 90°, but here, the angle is 108°, which suggests that the segment BZ creates an angle of 108° with XB. This implies that BZ extends beyond the square, making an angle of 108° with XB. 

In the pentagon, the internal angle at B is 108°, which is the angle between BA and BC. But since the square has XB and BC as sides, the segment BA is part of the pentagon. So, the angle between XB and BA would be the difference between the square's angle (90°) and the pentagon's internal angle (108°)? Wait, not sure. 

Wait, at point B, the square has sides XB and BC. The pentagon has sides BA and BC. So, the angle between XB and BA is the supplement of the angle between BA and BC (since the square's angle is between XB and BC, and the pentagon's internal angle is between BA and BC). So, the angle between XB and BA would be 180° minus the pentagon's internal angle at B. Wait, the internal angle of the pentagon at B is 108°, so the angle between BA and BC is 108°, while the angle between XB and BC is 90° (from the square). So, the angle between XB and BA would be 90° + (180° - 108°) ? No, perhaps not. Let me draw it mentally.

Imagine point B. In the square, the sides are XB and BC. In the pentagon, the sides at B are BA and BC. So, the angle between BA and BC is 108°, and the angle between XB and BC is 90°. Therefore, the angle between XB and BA is 108° - 90° = 18°? Wait, that depends on the orientation. Suppose the square's side BC is aligned with the pentagon's side BC. Then, the pentagon's side BA is at an angle of 108° from BC. The square's side XB is at 90° from BC. So, the angle between XB and BA would be 108° - 90° = 18°. 

But in our case, the angle at B between X and Z is given as 108°. So, if we assume that Z lies somewhere such that the angle between XB and BZ is 108°, then BZ is extending in a direction that forms 108° with XB. 

Similarly, proceeding further, the angle at Z between X and A is 108°, suggesting that ZA makes an angle of 108° with XZ. 

Continuing this chain, we can trace the path from X to Y to C to B to Z to A to D to C, and possibly back to X, forming a closed shape. The sum of the angles around this path would be 360°, hence the given sum equals 360°. 

Assuming this, the angles given are the turns made at each point along the path. Each turn corresponds to an external angle of the polygon formed by this path. 

For example, starting at X, moving to Y, then turning at Y by 90°, then moving to C, turning at C by 90°, then moving to B, turning at B by 108°, then moving to Z, turning at Z by 108°, then moving to A, turning at A by 108°, then moving to D, turning at D by 108°, and finally returning to X, completing the loop. 

The total of these turning angles is 360°, which is consistent with the given sum. 

Now, the total turning angle around a closed path is 360°, so the sum of these turning angles equals 360°. 

However, the individual angles given are the external angles at each vertex of this path. 

Wait, but in a polygon, the sum of external angles is 360°, but this applies to simple polygons. Here, the path is not necessarily a simple polygon, but the total turning angle is still 360°, which suggests that the sum of the angles given is indeed 360°. 

Therefore, these angles are the external angles of a polygon, and their sum is 360°, as expected. 

But how does this help us find the internal angle at X of the third polygon? Well, the angle between XY and XZ is the angle we're interested in, which is part of the third regular polygon. 

To find this angle, we need to consider the relationship between these angles and the overall path. 

Alternatively, since the third polygon has sides XY and XZ, and assuming it's regular, the angle between them (∠YXZ) would relate to the other angles in the path. 

Let me think about the entire path. Starting at X, moving to Y, then to C, then to B, then to Z, then to A, then to D, then to C, and back to X. Wait, but the last segment is from D to C, which connects back to C. But we need to return to X. Wait, maybe the path is X -> Y -> C -> B -> Z -> A -> D -> C -> ... ? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the path could be X -> Y -> C -> B -> Z -> A -> D -> C -> ... but how does it get back to X? This is unclear without a diagram. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that the angles given are the external angles of the path, and thus each contributes to the total turning angle. However, without knowing the exact path, it's challenging. 

Another approach: since we need to find the internal angle at X of the third polygon, which is the angle between XY and XZ. Let's attempt to calculate this angle using the other given angles. 

Let me consider the full rotation around point X. Normally, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but the given angles are not all around X. However, if we can find the angles at X related to the other points, we might derive the desired angle. 

But the only angles given that involve X are ∠YXC (at Y), ∠XCB (at C), ∠XBC (at B), etc. None of the given angles are directly at X. 

Wait, the angle ∠YXZ is the angle we need, and it's at X. How can we find this angle? 

Maybe by analyzing the other angles and using the fact that the sum of the given angles is 360°. 

Let me think about the total angles around point X. If we can express the angle ∠YXZ in terms of other angles, we could find its measure. 

Consider the following: 

From point X, we have two segments: XY (part of the square) and XZ (part of the third polygon). These two segments form the angle ∠YXZ. 

To find this angle, we might need to relate it to the other angles given. 

For example, consider the path from X to Y to C to B to Z to A to D to C, and back to X. Along this path, the direction changes at each point, with the given angles. 

At each point, the change in direction is the external angle. For example, at Y, the direction changes by 90°, at C by 90°, at B by 108°, at Z by 108°, at A by 108°, at D by 108°. 

These external angles add up to 360°, confirming the total turning is 360°. 

Now, the angle at X, which is ∠YXZ, is part of this path. When traveling from Y to C to B to Z..., the direction at X would depend on the previous segments. 

Alternatively, since the path starts at X, moves to Y, then turns by 90° at Y, then continues to C, turns by 90° at C, then turns by 108° at B, etc. 

The total turning angle is 360°, so the angle at X is determined by the remaining turning. 

Wait, but how? The initial direction at X is towards Y. After reaching Y, the turn is 90°, then at C another turn, etc. The angle ∠YXZ is the angle between XY and XZ, which would correspond to the direction change between arriving at X from Z and departing to Y. 

This is getting complicated. Perhaps we need to model the angles as vectors or use coordinate geometry. 

Let me assign coordinates to simplify. Assume point X is at the origin (0,0). Let’s define the square X-Y-C-B. Let's say XY is along the positive x-axis. Since it's a square, if XY is horizontal, then YC is vertical upward. Let's set coordinates:

Let’s assume square X-Y-C-B has side length s. Let's choose s=1 for simplicity. 

Set X at (0,0). Since XY is a side of the square, let's place Y at (1,0). Then, since it's a square, YC is vertical upwards, so C is at (1,1). Then, B is at (0,1). 

Now, the pentagon has vertices A, B, C, D, Z. Points B and C are already defined as (0,1) and (1,1). 

In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108°. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DZ, ZA. 

We need to find coordinates of A, D, Z. 

Starting from point B (0,1), the next point in the pentagon is C (1,1). The side BC is from (0,1) to (1,1), which is horizontal. The next side is CD, which should make an internal angle of 108° at C. 

In a regular pentagon, the angle at C between BC and CD is 108°. Since BC is from B to C (rightward), CD should be at an angle of 108° from BC. 

The direction from C to D: since BC is along the positive x-axis (from B to C), the internal angle at C is 108°, so the direction from C to D turns 72° upward from BC (since external angle of regular pentagon is 72°, as 360/5 = 72°). Wait, the external angle of a regular pentagon is 72°, so the turn at each vertex is 72°. 

Wait, the internal angle is 108°, so the external angle is 180° - 108° = 72°. 

So, at point C, the direction changes by 72°. Since the incoming direction to C is from B to C (along positive x-axis), the outgoing direction from C to D is obtained by turning left by the external angle of 72°. 

Assuming the pentagon is oriented counterclockwise, the direction from C to D would be 72° above the direction from B to C. Since the direction from B to C is along positive x-axis, turning left (counterclockwise) by 72° would mean the direction from C to D is 72° above the x-axis. 

Thus, the vector from C to D is at an angle of 72° from the x-axis. 

Let’s calculate coordinates of D. 

The length of each side of the pentagon is 1 (same as square, assuming unit length). So, from point C (1,1), moving at 72° for length 1: 

Δx = cos(72°), Δy = sin(72°). 

So, D is at (1 + cos(72°), 1 + sin(72°)). 

Next, from D, the next side is DZ. The direction from D to Z should make an internal angle of 108° at D. 

This process is getting complex, but perhaps we can proceed. 

Once we have D, then Z is determined. Then, from Z, the side ZA connects back to A. 

But our interest is in point Z, which is connected to X via XZ. 

Our goal is to find the angle between XY (along x-axis from X(0,0) to Y(1,0)) and XZ. 

So, once we find coordinates of Z, we can compute the angle between vectors XY (from X to Y) and XZ (from X to Z). 

Let me attempt to compute coordinates of Z. 

Starting from point C (1,1), move to D as described. 

Compute cos(72°) and sin(72°):

cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511

So, D is at (1 + 0.3090, 1 + 0.9511) ≈ (1.3090, 1.9511)

Next, from D, the direction to Z needs to be determined. The internal angle at D is 108°. 

To find the direction of DZ, we need to calculate the external angle. Again, the external angle at D is 72°, so the direction from D to Z turns 72° from the direction of CD. 

The direction from C to D was 72° from x-axis. So, the direction from D to Z would be 72° + 72° = 144° from x-axis (assuming counterclockwise turn). Wait, the external angle is the angle you turn when walking around the polygon. So, if the pentagon is counterclockwise, at each vertex, you turn left by the external angle. 

At point D, the incoming direction is from C to D (angle 72°), and the outgoing direction from D to Z would be 72° + 72° = 144° from x-axis. 

Wait, no. The direction from C to D is 72°, and at D, the external angle is 72°, so the new direction is previous direction plus external angle. 

Yes, if you're moving along CD (direction 72°), then at D, you turn left by 72°, so the new direction is 72° + 72° = 144° from x-axis. 

Thus, the direction from D to Z is 144°. 

Length of DZ is 1 (same as pentagon's side). So, coordinates of Z are:

D_x + cos(144°), D_y + sin(144°)

Compute cos(144°) and sin(144°):

144° is in second quadrant. cos(144°) = cos(180°-36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090

sin(144°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878

So, Z_x = 1.3090 + (-0.8090) ≈ 0.5

Z_y = 1.9511 + 0.5878 ≈ 2.5389

So, Z is approximately (0.5, 2.5389)

Now, we need to find the angle between XZ and XY. 

Vector XY is from X(0,0) to Y(1,0), which is along the x-axis. 

Vector XZ is from X(0,0) to Z(0.5, 2.5389). 

The angle between these two vectors is the angle at X between XY and XZ, which is ∠YXZ. 

To find this angle, we can use the dot product:

cos(theta) = (XY · XZ) / (|XY| |XZ|)

XY vector is (1, 0), XZ vector is (0.5, 2.5389)

Dot product = 1 * 0.5 + 0 * 2.5389 = 0.5

|XY| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1

|XZ| = sqrt(0.5^2 + (2.5389)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.25 + 6.445) ≈ sqrt(6.695) ≈ 2.587

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 0.5 / 2.587 ≈ 0.193

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(0.193) ≈ 78.7 degrees

Wait, but this is an approximate calculation. Let's verify with exact trigonometric identities. 

Alternatively, notice that the coordinates were computed using approximated values, but perhaps there's an exact expression. 

Alternatively, recall that in a regular pentagon, the distance from one vertex to another can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio. But this might complicate things. 

However, our approximation gave us θ ≈ 78.7°. Let's check if this makes sense. 

Now, this angle ∠YXZ is the internal angle of the third regular polygon. For a regular n-gon, the internal angle is [(n-2)/n] * 180°. So, setting this equal to θ:

[(n-2)/n] * 180 = θ

Rearranged:

(n-2)/n = θ/180

=> 1 - 2/n = θ/180

=> 2/n = 1 - θ/180

=> n = 2 / (1 - θ/180)

Plugging in θ ≈ 78.7°:

n ≈ 2 / (1 - 78.7/180) ≈ 2 / (1 - 0.437) ≈ 2 / 0.563 ≈ 3.55

But this is impossible, as n must be integer ≥3. So, there must be an error in the calculation. 

Wait, this suggests that my assumption about the angle ∠YXZ being θ is wrong. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the angle between XY and XZ. 

Let me double-check the coordinates. 

Earlier, I assumed the pentagon has side length 1, same as the square. However, in reality, the square and pentagon may have different side lengths. But in the problem, it's stated that XY and XZ are sides of the third regular polygon. Since XY is a side of the square and XZ is a side of the pentagon, their lengths are equal? Or are they? 

Wait, in the square, XY is a side, so its length is equal to the square's side length. In the pentagon, XZ is not a side but a diagonal? Or is XZ a side? Wait, XZ is a segment from X to Z. In the pentagon, the vertices are A, B, C, D, Z. So, Z is a vertex of the pentagon. X is not part of the pentagon. So, XZ is a line from X to Z, which is not a side of the pentagon. Hence, XZ is not necessarily equal in length to the pentagon's side. Therefore, my earlier assumption that both XY and XZ are of length 1 may be incorrect. 

This complicates the coordinate approach, as the lengths of XY and XZ may differ. Therefore, the earlier calculation of ∠YXZ is invalid because it assumes equal lengths. 

Alternative approach: instead of assuming unit length, let's consider ratios. 

Let me denote the length of XY as 'a' (side of square), and XZ as 'b' (unknown). Since both are sides of the third regular polygon, they must be equal. Hence, a = b. 

Wait, the third polygon is regular, so all its sides are equal. Therefore, XY and XZ must be equal in length. Thus, the length of XY (side of square) must equal the length of XZ (distance from X to Z in the pentagon). 

This introduces a constraint that the side length of the square equals the length from X to Z in the pentagon. 

But how can we ensure this? Let's revisit the coordinate system. 

Let me adjust the coordinate system to account for this. Let's suppose the square has side length s, and the pentagon has side length t. But since XY (square side) = XZ (distance from X to Z), we have s = t. 

But how to compute XZ in terms of the pentagon's side length. 

Let me reconsider the pentagon's coordinates with this in mind. 

Assume the square has side length s. Let's take s=1 for simplicity. Then, the pentagon must have side length t=1 as well. 

Previously, I calculated Z's coordinates as approximately (0.5, 2.5389). Let's recalculate with precise values. 

First, compute coordinates of D:

From point C(1,1), moving at 72° for length 1. 

Coordinates of D: x = 1 + cos(72°), y = 1 + sin(72°). 

cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2 ≈ 0.3090, but exact value is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2? Wait, cos(72°) is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, or more precisely, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2? Actually, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2? Let me recall that cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2. Alternatively, it's known that cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, but exact value is (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 * 0.5? No, exact value is cos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2, which simplifies to (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 * 1. Wait, no. Let me recall that cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2. 

Actually, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2, but I'll use exact expressions for precision. 

But this is getting too complex. Let me instead use exact trigonometric identities. 

Let me consider the regular pentagon with side length 1. The coordinates can be determined using polar coordinates. 

Alternatively, use complex numbers. 

Let me place point C at (1,1). The regular pentagon has vertices with angles spaced by 72°. But this requires careful construction. 

Alternatively, recall that in a regular pentagon, the distance between non-consecutive vertices can be calculated. For example, the diagonal of a regular pentagon (distance between two vertices separated by one other vertex) is φ times the side length, where φ is the golden ratio (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. 

But in this case, XZ is not a diagonal of the pentagon but a line from X to Z, where X is outside the pentagon. 

This suggests that my earlier approach is too vague. Perhaps there's a better way. 

Let me try to find the angle between XY and XZ by considering the other given angles. 

We know that the sum of the given angles is 360°. The angles are:

At Y: 90° (between X and C)
At C: 90° (between X and B)
At B: 108° (between X and Z)
At Z: 108° (between X and A)
At A: 108° (between X and D)
At D: 108° (between X and C)

Wait, but how do these angles
