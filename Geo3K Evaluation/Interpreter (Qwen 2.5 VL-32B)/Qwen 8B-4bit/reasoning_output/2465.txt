Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different parts connect. 

So, we have a triangle PQR with points P, Q, R. Lines l, m, n are the perpendicular bisectors of this triangle, and they intersect at point T. That means T is the circumcenter of triangle PQR because the perpendicular bisectors of a triangle meet at the circumcenter. 

Now, the problem gives several length equalities. Let me list them out again:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,T)), LengthOf(Line(Q,T))) → PT = QT
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,T)), LengthOf(Line(R,T))) → PT = RT
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), LengthOf(Line(R,T))) → QT = RT
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,T)), 8) → RT = 8
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), 2x) → QT = 2x
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,T)), 3y - 1) → PT = 3y - 1
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,R)), z + 4) → PR = z + 4
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,R)), 7) → QR = 7

Wait, but since T is the circumcenter, it should be equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. So PT = QT = RT. But according to the given, RT is 8, so PT and QT should also be 8. However, there are variables here. Let me check.

From the first set of equalities, PT equals QT equals RT. Since RT is given as 8, that would mean PT = QT = 8. But then there are expressions involving variables. For example, PT is given as 3y - 1, which should equal 8. Similarly, QT is 2x, which should equal 8. Also, RT is 8, which is fixed. 

But wait, maybe there's more going on here. Because if T is the circumradius, then all those distances are radii of the circumscribed circle. Therefore, PT = QT = RT = 8. Therefore, PT = 8, so 3y - 1 = 8. Solving that gives 3y = 9 ⇒ y = 3. Also, QT = 2x = 8 ⇒ x = 4. 

But the question asks for z. How do we relate z? Looking back at the other given equality: PR = z + 4. So we need to find PR's length. 

Since PR is one side of the triangle, and QR is given as 7. Wait, QR is another side. So maybe we can use some triangle properties here. Since T is the circumcenter, perhaps we can relate the sides of the triangle to the circumradius. 

Alternatively, since T is the circumcenter, the distance from T to each vertex is the circumradius. But in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides via the formula:

R = (a b c) / (4 Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle, and a, b, c are the sides. But I don't know if that helps directly here unless we can compute the area.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider coordinates. Let me try setting up coordinate axes. Let me place the triangle such that T is at the origin (0,0). Then, since T is the circumcenter, points P, Q, R lie on a circle centered at T with radius 8. 

Let me assign coordinates. Suppose T is at (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for P, Q, R such that they are all at distance 8 from T. 

But without knowing angles or more info, maybe another approach is better. Since we have two sides: QR is 7, and PR is z+4. Also, PQ is something else. Maybe using the Law of Cosines?

Wait, but we need more relations. Alternatively, since T is the circumcenter, the position vectors of P, Q, R satisfy certain properties. But maybe that's too abstract. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that in any triangle, the circumradius R is given by R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. But again, without knowing angles, this might not help directly. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that in triangle PQR, the sides are related to the circumradius. Let me denote the sides:

Let’s call the sides as follows:

- QR = a = 7 (given)
- PR = b = z + 4 (unknown)
- PQ = c (unknown)

And the circumradius R = 8. 

Using the formula for circumradius:

R = (a b c)/(4Δ) = 8.

But we need more relations. Alternatively, using the formula R = a/(2 sin A), but again, angles are unknown. 

Alternatively, since T is the circumcenter, the distances from T to each vertex are all 8. So, if we consider triangle PQR with circumradius 8, then the sides are related to the angles. 

But perhaps another way: since T is the circumcenter, then the perpendicular bisectors of the sides pass through T. 

Wait, but maybe we can use coordinates. Let me try placing the triangle in coordinate system. Let me suppose that T is at (0,0). Let me assume that point R is at (8, 0) because TR = 8. Then, points P and Q are somewhere on the circle centered at T with radius 8. 

Also, QR = 7. Since R is at (8,0), then Q is a point on the circle such that the distance between Q and R is 7. Let me write coordinates for Q as (x, y), satisfying x² + y² = 64 (since it's on the circle), and the distance between Q and R (which is (8,0)) is sqrt[(x-8)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 7. Squaring both sides: (x-8)^2 + y^2 = 49. Expanding: x² - 16x + 64 + y² = 49. But since x² + y² = 64, substitute that in: 64 -16x +64 = 49 → 128 -16x = 49 → 16x = 128 -49 = 79 → x = 79/16. Hmm, that seems messy. Not sure if helpful yet. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. We have PR = z + 4. Point P is also on the circle of radius 8 around T. Let me denote coordinates for P as (p_x, p_y), same for Q and R. 

But maybe instead of coordinates, think about vectors. Or perhaps use the fact that in triangle PQR, the sides can be expressed in terms of the law of cosines. But again, without angles, this might not help. 

Wait, but we have two sides: QR = 7, and PR = z + 4. Also, we might find PQ using the other relations? But how?

Alternatively, since T is the circumcenter, the distances from T to each vertex are equal. But also, the position of T relative to the triangle depends on whether the triangle is acute, obtuse, or right-angled. For instance, if the triangle is acute, the circumcenter lies inside; if it's right-angled, the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse; if obtuse, outside. 

But since T is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and given the distances PT=QT=RT=8, maybe we can find relations between the sides. 

Another idea: In any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula:

R = abc/(4Δ), where Δ is the area. So, if we can express the area in terms of the sides, maybe we can find another equation.

We know QR = a = 7, PR = b = z + 4, and PQ = c. But we need more info. Wait, but if we can find another expression for the area. 

Alternatively, using Heron's formula. But we need all three sides. 

Alternatively, maybe using the formula that relates the sides to the circumradius. Another formula is:

In any triangle,

a = 2R sin A,
b = 2R sin B,
c = 2R sin C.

Where A, B, C are the angles opposite sides a, b, c respectively.

Given that R = 8, so:

a = 7 = 2*8*sin A → sin A = 7/(16)
Similarly, b = z + 4 = 2*8*sin B → sin B = (z+4)/16
c = 2*8*sin C → sin C = c/16

Also, since angles sum to π radians:

A + B + C = π.

But without knowing any angles, this might not directly help. Unless we can relate angles through other relations. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines. For example, in triangle ABC:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)

But again, without knowing the other sides or angles, it's tricky. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship here. Since T is the circumcenter, and the distances from T to each vertex are equal. So, in triangle PQR, the distances from T to each vertex are equal to the circumradius, which is 8. So, the triangle has sides of length a=7, b=z+4, c=?, and circumradius 8. 

But I still need another equation. Perhaps we can use the formula that connects the sides with the circumradius:

For any triangle,

R = a/(2 sin A) = b/(2 sin B) = c/(2 sin C).

But since we have a=7, and R=8, then:

sin A = 7/(2R) = 7/(16)

Similarly, sin B = (z+4)/(16)

And sin C = c/(16)

Additionally, since A + B + C = π, we can use trigonometric identities. But this seems complicated. 

Alternatively, since we have two expressions for sine of angles, maybe we can use the identity that sin² A + sin² B + sin² C + 2 sin A sin B sin C = 1 ?

Not sure about that identity. Maybe not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe considering the fact that in any triangle, the sum of angles is π, so A + B + C = π. And using the sine addition formulas? This seems too vague. 

Alternatively, perhaps use the Law of Cosines on the triangle formed by the circumradius. Wait, but I'm stuck here. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. Since T is the circumcenter, then OT is perpendicular to the side QR, where O is the circumcenter. Wait, no, the perpendicular bisector of QR passes through T. So, the line joining T to the midpoint of QR is perpendicular to QR. 

But since we know QR = 7, its midpoint M would divide QR into segments of 3.5 units. The length from T to M is the distance from the circumcenter to the side QR, which can be calculated as:

Distance from circumcenter to side QR is R cos A, where A is the angle opposite QR. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, in general, the distance from the circumcenter to a side is R cos A, where A is the angle opposite that side. 

So, for side QR (opposite angle P), the distance from T to QR is R cos P. 

But also, since the perpendicular bisector of QR passes through T, and the distance from T to QR is equal to that. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, the length from T to QR is equal to the height of the triangle from T to QR, but since T is the circumcenter, maybe we can relate this to other elements. 

Alternatively, using coordinates again. Let me try this again. Let me place point R at (8, 0) as before, and T at (0,0). Then, QR is 7, so point Q is somewhere on the circle of radius 8 around T, and the distance between Q and R is 7. As earlier, solving equations gave us coordinates for Q as (x, y) where x = 79/16 ≈ 4.9375, but that seems messy. 

But if I can find coordinates for Q and P, then I can calculate PR. Wait, PR is the distance between P and R. Since R is at (8,0), and P is another point on the circle of radius 8, then PR would be the distance between P and R. 

But since P is also on the circle, PR can be found using the chord length formula. The chord length between two points on a circle is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle between them. 

So, if I can find the angle between points P and R as viewed from the center T, then PR = 2*8*sin(theta/2). 

But how to find theta? Well, if I can relate theta to other angles in the triangle. 

Alternatively, since we know QR = 7, which corresponds to the chord between Q and R. The chord length QR is 7 = 2*8*sin(phi/2), where phi is the central angle between Q and R. Solving for phi:

7 = 16 sin(phi/2) → sin(phi/2) = 7/16 → phi/2 = arcsin(7/16) → phi = 2 arcsin(7/16). 

Then, the central angle between Q and R is phi. Similarly, the central angle between P and R would depend on the other sides. But this might not directly help. 

Alternatively, since we have PR = z + 4, which is the chord length between P and R. Let me denote the central angle between P and R as alpha. Then:

PR = 2*8*sin(alpha/2) = 16 sin(alpha/2) = z + 4. 

But without knowing alpha, I can’t proceed directly. 

However, the total central angles around T add up to 360 degrees. So, the central angles corresponding to the sides QR, PR, and PQ must add up to 360 degrees. Let me denote:

Central angle for QR: phi = 2 arcsin(7/16)
Central angle for PR: alpha 
Central angle for PQ: beta 

Thus, phi + alpha + beta = 2π radians. 

But I don't know alpha or beta. However, there might be another relation. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on the triangle formed by points P, Q, R. 

Wait, in the original triangle PQR, the sides are QR = 7, PR = z+4, PQ = ?. 

But we could also relate these sides using the Law of Cosines. However, without knowing any angles or other sides, it's challenging. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that the circumradius is 8. Using the formula:

R = a/(2 sin A) = 7/(2 sin A) = 8 → sin A = 7/(16)

Similarly, for angle B (opposite side PR):

R = (z+4)/(2 sin B) = 8 → sin B = (z+4)/16

And for angle C (opposite side PQ): sin C = PQ/(16)

Also, since A + B + C = π, we can write:

A = arcsin(7/16)
B = arcsin((z+4)/16)
C = π - A - B

But then, using the identity that sin(C) = sin(π - A - B) = sin(A + B)

So, sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B

But also, from above, sin C = PQ/16

But we don't know PQ. However, maybe we can relate PQ with other sides via the Law of Cosines. 

Law of Cosines on triangle PQR:

QR² = PR² + PQ² - 2 PR * PQ * cos(angle P)

Wait, but angle P is the angle at point P, which is opposite side QR. Earlier, we had that sin A = 7/16, where A is angle P. Wait, no—wait, earlier, I considered angle A as opposite side a, which was QR = 7. So angle A is at P, since side QR is opposite angle P. 

Wait, in standard notation, side a is BC, opposite angle A. So in our case, if QR = 7 is side a, then angle A is at P. 

Therefore, angle at P is angle A, with sin A = 7/16. 

So, using Law of Cosines:

QR² = PR² + PQ² - 2 * PR * PQ * cos A

But we know QR = 7, PR = z + 4, and angle A. 

But we need to express cos A. Since we know sin A = 7/16, then cos A = sqrt(1 - (7/16)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/256) = sqrt(207/256) = sqrt(207)/16. 

So plugging into the Law of Cosines:

7² = (z + 4)^2 + PQ² - 2*(z + 4)*PQ*(sqrt(207)/16)

This seems very complicated. Without knowing PQ, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe there's another way. Wait, earlier we had expressions for sin B and sin C. From angle sums:

A + B + C = π → A = π - B - C

But also, using the sine formula:

sin A = 7/16, sin B = (z+4)/16, sin C = PQ/16

But since A = π - B - C, then:

sin A = sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C

But this leads to:

7/16 = [(z+4)/16] * cos C + cos B * (PQ/16)

This seems too many variables. 

Alternatively, since we have three equations from the sine formula:

sin A = 7/16
sin B = (z+4)/16
sin C = PQ/16

And A + B + C = π. 

But without more information, it's difficult to find relations between these. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that in any triangle, the product of the sines of the angles is related to the sides. But I don't recall a direct formula. 

Alternatively, using the fact that the sum of angles is π. Let me consider that:

Let me denote sin A = 7/16, sin B = (z+4)/16, sin C = PQ/16. Also, A + B + C = π.

But without knowing PQ or any angles, this is still underdetermined. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to take a different approach. Let's go back to the initial data. 

We have PR = z + 4. We need to find z. We know that T is the circumcenter, so PT = RT = 8. 

Wait, earlier I thought that PT = QT = RT = 8 because T is the circumcenter. Is that always true? Yes! Because the circumcenter is equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. So, the distance from T to P, Q, R is the same, which is the circumradius. Hence, PT = QT = RT = 8. 

Therefore, PT = 8, so from the given, PT = 3y - 1. Thus:

3y - 1 = 8 → 3y = 9 → y = 3. 

Also, QT = 2x = 8 → x = 4. 

But how does this help with finding z? 

We need to find PR = z + 4. So, if we can find PR, we can subtract 4 to get z. 

How to find PR? 

Well, since PR is a side of the triangle, and we know QR = 7. Maybe we can find another side or use some property. 

Wait, since T is the circumcenter, and the distances from T to the vertices are all 8, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in some right triangles. 

For example, the perpendicular bisector of QR passes through T. Let me consider the midpoint of QR. Let's call it M. Then TM is the perpendicular bisector of QR, so TM is perpendicular to QR and passes through T. 

The length of TM can be calculated using the formula for the distance from the circumcenter to a side. Which is R cos A, where A is the angle opposite the side. 

Earlier, we said that sin A = 7/16, so cos A = sqrt(1 - (7/16)^2) = sqrt(207)/16. 

So, TM = R cos A = 8 * sqrt(207)/16 = sqrt(207)/2. 

But also, in triangle TMR, where M is the midpoint of QR, which has length 7, so QM = MR = 3.5. 

Then, in triangle TMR, we have a right triangle (since TM is perpendicular to QR), so:

TR² = TM² + MR² → 8² = (sqrt(207)/2)^2 + (3.5)^2

Let me check this:

Left side: 64

Right side: (207/4) + (12.25) = 51.75 + 12.25 = 64. 

Yes! It works. So this confirms the calculation. 

But how does this help us find PR? 

Let me think. Similarly, if I consider the midpoint of PR, say N. The perpendicular bisector of PR passes through T. The length TN is the distance from T to the side PR, which is R cos B, where B is the angle opposite PR. 

Let me denote angle B as the angle at Q, since PR is opposite angle Q. Wait, in standard notation, side opposite angle Q is PR. 

So, angle B is angle at Q, and the distance from T to PR is R cos B. 

Similarly, the length of the perpendicular from T to PR is R cos B. 

Also, the midpoint N of PR divides PR into two equal parts, so PN = NR = (PR)/2 = (z+4)/2. 

Again, in the right triangle TNM (where M is the midpoint of PR?), no, wait, the midpoint of PR is N, and the perpendicular from T to PR is TN, forming a right triangle with TN being the height. 

Thus, TR² = TN² + (PN)^2 → 8² = [R cos B]^2 + [(z+4)/2]^2. 

So substituting R = 8:

64 = (8 cos B)^2 + [(z+4)/2]^2 

Which simplifies to:

64 = 64 cos² B + [(z+4)/2]^2 

But we also know from earlier that sin B = (z+4)/16, since from the sine formula:

sin B = (side opposite B)/ (2R) = PR/(2R) = (z+4)/(16). 

Wait, earlier I had said that for angle B (opposite side PR), sin B = (z+4)/16. 

But wait, the formula for the circumradius is R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. So, for angle B, which is opposite side PR (let's call it side b), we have:

R = b/(2 sin B) → 8 = (z+4)/(2 sin B) → sin B = (z+4)/(16). 

Correct. 

So, sin B = (z+4)/16. Therefore, cos B = sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2). 

Substituting into the previous equation:

64 = 64 * [ (z+4)^2 / 256 ] + [(z+4)/2]^2 

Let me simplify this:

First term: 64 * (z+4)^2 / 256 = (z+4)^2 / 4

Second term: [(z+4)/2]^2 = (z+4)^2 / 4 

So adding them together:

(z+4)^2 /4 + (z+4)^2 /4 = (z+4)^2 /2 

Set equal to 64:

(z+4)^2 / 2 = 64 → (z+4)^2 = 128 → z+4 = sqrt(128) = 8√2 

Wait, but sqrt(128) is approximately 11.31, but the answer choices are integers from 3 to 6. So this suggests a contradiction. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, this indicates that my assumption is wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the derivation. 

I used the equation TR² = TN² + (PN)^2, where TR is the distance from T to R, which is 8. 

But TN is the distance from T to the side PR, which is R cos B. 

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. 

The distance from the circumcenter to the side PR is indeed R cos B, where B is the angle at Q. 

But why? Because in a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a side is equal to R cos B, where B is the angle opposite that side. 

Alternatively, think of the projection of the circumradius onto the side. 

Alternatively, in triangle TNR, where N is the midpoint of PR, and TN is the distance from T to PR. Since TN is perpendicular to PR, and N is the midpoint, then TR is the hypotenuse of the right triangle TN-RN. 

So, TR² = TN² + RN² → 8² = TN² + (PR/2)^2 → 64 = TN² + [(z+4)/2]^2 

But TN is the distance from T to PR, which is equal to R cos B. 

So, TN = R cos B = 8 cos B. 

Thus, substituting:

64 = (8 cos B)^2 + [(z+4)/2]^2 

Which expands to:

64 = 64 cos² B + [(z+4)/2]^2 

But earlier, I had written sin B = (z+4)/16, so cos² B = 1 - [(z+4)/16]^2. 

Thus, substituting:

64 = 64[1 - ((z+4)/16)^2] + [(z+4)/2]^2 

Expand this:

64 = 64 - 64*((z+4)^2)/256 + [(z+4)^2]/4 

Simplify the second term: 64*((z+4)^2)/256 = (z+4)^2 /4 

So:

64 = 64 - (z+4)^2 /4 + (z+4)^2 /4 

Wait, that simplifies to 64 = 64. 

Oh no! That means the equation reduces to an identity, providing no new information. So this approach doesn't help us find z. 

Hmm. So this method isn't helping. What else can I do? 

Wait, maybe I should use the Law of Cosines on the triangle PQR. We know QR = 7, PR = z + 4, and we need to find PQ. But we also know that the circumradius is 8. 

Let me recall the formula that relates the sides of a triangle to its circumradius:

R = (abc)/(4Δ), where Δ is the area. 

So, we have R = 8, and a = QR = 7, b = PR = z + 4, c = PQ. 

But we need to express Δ in terms of the sides. 

Alternatively, using Heron's formula, Δ = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s = (a+b+c)/2. 

But without knowing PQ, this is still two unknowns. 

Alternatively, using the formula Δ = (1/2)ab sin C. But again, missing angles. 

Wait, but earlier we had expressions for sin A, sin B, sin C. 

Recall that:

sin A = 7/16, sin B = (z+4)/16, sin C = PQ/16. 

Also, since A + B + C = π, and using the identity that sin C = sin(π - A - B) = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. 

So:

PQ/16 = sin A cos B + cos A sin B 

We already know sin A = 7/16, and sin B = (z+4)/16. 

Also, cos A = sqrt(1 - (7/16)^2) = sqrt(207)/16, as before. 

Cos B = sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2). 

So:

PQ/16 = (7/16) * sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2) + (sqrt(207)/16) * (z+4)/16 

Multiply both sides by 16:

PQ = 7 * sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2) + (sqrt(207)*(z+4))/16 

But this still leaves us with PQ in terms of z, which we don't know. 

But we also have from the Law of Cosines on triangle PQR:

QR² = PR² + PQ² - 2 * PR * PQ * cos A 

Plugging in QR = 7, PR = z+4, and cos A = sqrt(207)/16:

7² = (z+4)^2 + PQ² - 2*(z+4)*PQ*(sqrt(207)/16) 

This is getting too complex. Maybe there's a smarter approach. 

Wait, but earlier, I noticed that using the formula for the circumradius R = abc/(4Δ), and knowing that R = 8, a = 7, b = z+4, c = PQ. 

So:

8 = (7 * (z+4) * PQ) / (4Δ) → 32Δ = 7(z+4)PQ 

But Δ is also equal to (1/2)*ab sin C, but again, not helpful. 

Alternatively, using the formula Δ = (1/2)*PR*QR*sin(angle at R). Wait, angle at R is angle at R, which is opposite to PQ. Let me denote angle at R as angle C. 

So, Δ = (1/2)*PR*QR*sin C = (1/2)*(z+4)*7*sin C 

But from earlier, sin C = PQ/16. 

So:

Δ = (7(z+4)/2) * (PQ/16) = 7(z+4)PQ / 32 

Setting this equal to the earlier expression from R:

32Δ = 7(z+4)PQ → 32Δ = 7(z+4)PQ 

But from the other expression, 32Δ = 7(z+4)PQ, so it's consistent. No new information. 

This seems like a dead end. 

Wait, maybe there's a property I missed. Since T is the circumcenter, the distances from T to each vertex are equal, so TP = TQ = TR = 8. 

Also, the triangle PQR has sides QR = 7, PR = z+4, and PQ. 

But if we consider the median from T to QR, which we've already done, but not helpful. 

Wait, let me think about vector approaches. Assume T is the origin. Let vectors OP = vector p, OQ = vector q, OR = vector r, all with magnitude 8. 

Then, the distance between P and Q is |p - q| = PQ, and similarly for others. 

Given that QR = 7, so |q - r| = 7. 

Also, PR = z + 4, so |p - r| = z + 4. 

But without more information about the vectors, this is still underdetermined. 

But maybe we can use the fact that the dot product between vectors. 

For example, |p - q|^2 = |p|^2 + |q|^2 - 2p·q = 2*8^2 - 2p·q = 128 - 2p·q = PQ^2. 

Similarly, |q - r|^2 = 128 - 2q·r = 49. 

And |p - r|^2 = 128 - 2p·r = (z + 4)^2. 

So, we have:

1. 128 - 2p·q = PQ^2
2. 128 - 2q·r = 49 → 2q·r = 128 - 49 = 79 → q·r = 79/2
3. 128 - 2p·r = (z + 4)^2 → 2p·r = 128 - (z + 4)^2 → p·r = [128 - (z + 4)^2]/2 

But how to relate these? 

Also, since T is the circumcenter, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides pass through T. For example, the perpendicular bisector of QR passes through T, which implies that T lies on the perpendicular bisector of QR. 

But since T is the origin, and QR is the segment between q and r, the perpendicular bisector of QR passes through the midpoint of QR and is perpendicular to QR. 

The midpoint of QR is (q + r)/2, and the direction of QR is r - q. The perpendicular bisector must be the line passing through (q + r)/2 and perpendicular to r - q. 

Since T is on this line, it must satisfy the condition that the vector from the midpoint to T is perpendicular to the direction of QR. 

So, the vector from midpoint to T is T - midpoint = - (q + r)/2. This vector must be perpendicular to (r - q). 

Thus:

[- (q + r)/2] · (r - q) = 0 

Expanding:

- (q + r) · (r - q)/2 = 0 → -(q·r - q·q + r·r - r·q)/2 = 0 

Simplifying:

-(q·r - |q|^2 + |r|^2 - q·r)/2 = -( - |q|^2 + |r|^2 )/2 = 0 

Since |q|^2 = |r|^2 = 64, this becomes:

-( -64 + 64 )/2 = 0 → 0 = 0. 

So this condition holds automatically, giving no new information. 

Same for other perpendicular bisectors. 

This suggests that the conditions are consistent but don't provide new equations. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider another approach. Let me revisit the problem statement. 

The problem says that lines l, m, n are the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle PQR and meet at T. So T is the circumcenter. Given that, and the lengths PT = 3y - 1, QT = 2x, RT = 8, and PT = QT = RT = 8. 

Wait, earlier I concluded that PT = QT = RT = 8, so from PT = 3y - 1, 3y - 1 = 8 → y = 3. From QT = 2x = 8 → x = 4. 

But how to find z? 

Wait, the problem asks for z, which is part of PR = z + 4. So PR = z + 4. 

But how to find PR? 

Wait, perhaps using the fact that in any triangle, the square of a side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides times the cosine of the included angle. 

But we know one side (QR = 7), and we need to relate the other sides. 

Wait, but we also know the circumradius. There is a formula relating the sides of a triangle to the circumradius: 

R = a / (2 sin A) = b / (2 sin B) = c / (2 sin C). 

As before, for side a = QR = 7, R = 8, so sin A = 7/(2R) = 7/16. 

For side b = PR = z + 4, sin B = (z+4)/16. 

And for side c = PQ, sin C = c/16. 

Also, since A + B + C = π, we have:

A = π - B - C 

Taking sine of both sides:

sin A = sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C 

But sin A = 7/16, and sin B = (z+4)/16, sin C = c/16. 

But we also know from the Law of Cosines that:

cos A = sqrt(1 - (7/16)^2) = sqrt(207)/16 

Similarly, cos B = sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2), and cos C = sqrt(1 - (c/16)^2). 

But this leads to:

7/16 = [(z+4)/16] * sqrt(1 - (c/16)^2) + sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2) * (c/16) 

This equation involves both z and c, making it complex. 

However, we also have from the Law of Cosines on triangle PQR:

QR² = PR² + PQ² - 2 * PR * PQ * cos A 

Which is:

7² = (z+4)^2 + c^2 - 2*(z+4)*c*(sqrt(207)/16) 

But this is another equation with variables z and c. 

So, we have two equations with two unknowns z and c. 

But solving this system seems complex. Let me see if there's a way to eliminate c. 

Let me denote PR = b = z + 4, PQ = c. 

From the sine formula, we have:

sin B = b/(2R) = b/16 = (z+4)/16 

And sin C = c/16 

Also, from the angle sum:

A + B + C = π → A = π - B - C 

So, using the sine of A:

sin A = sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C 

Which gives:

7/16 = [(z+4)/16] * sqrt(1 - (c/16)^2) + sqrt(1 - [(z+4)/16]^2) * (c/16) 

This is quite complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between b and c. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines equation:

49 = b² + c² - 2bc * (sqrt(207)/16) 

But b = z + 4, and c is PQ. 

But without knowing c, it's still challenging. 

Wait, but from the earlier equation with the sine formula, perhaps we can find a relation between b and c. 

Let me try to isolate terms. 

Let me denote:

Let me define u = z + 4 = b, v = c. 

So:

7/16 = (u/16) * sqrt(1 - (v/16)^2) + sqrt(1 - (u/16)^2) * (v/16) 

Multiply both sides by 16:

7 = u * sqrt(1 - (v/16)^2) + v * sqrt(1 - (u/16)^2) 

This is a single equation with two variables u and v. 

But from the Law of Cosines:

49 = u² + v² - 2uv * (sqrt(207)/16) 

So now, we have two equations with two variables u and v. 

This system may be solvable, but it's non-linear and complex. Let me see if there's a substitution or a clever observation. 

Alternatively, perhaps assuming that the triangle is right-angled? Let me check. 

If the triangle were right-angled, then the circumradius would be half the hypotenuse. 

Suppose that angle at R is right. Then the hypotenuse would be PQ, and R would be the midpoint of PQ. But in this case, the circumradius would be PQ/2. But we know the circumradius is 8, so PQ = 16. 

But then, if PQ = 16, then from the Law of Cosines:

QR² + PR² = PQ² → 7² + (z+4)^2 = 16² → 49 + (z+4)^2 = 256 → (z+4)^2 = 207 → z+4 = sqrt(207) ≈ 14.39, which is not an integer, and none of the answer choices are close to this. 

Alternatively, if the triangle is right-angled at P or Q. 

If right-angled at P, then the hypotenuse would be QR = 7, so the circumradius would be 7/2 = 3.5, but our circumradius is 8, so this is impossible. 

If right-angled at Q, then hypotenuse would be PR = z+4, so circumradius is (z+4)/2 = 8 → z+4 = 16 → z = 12, which is not among the options. 

So the triangle is not right-angled. 

Another idea: since we know PR = z + 4 and QR = 7, and the circumradius is 8, perhaps we can use the formula for the circumradius in terms of the sides:

R = abc / (4Δ) 

Where a = 7, b = z+4, c = PQ, and Δ is the area. 

But we also have Δ = (1/2) * a * b * sin C, but not sure. 

Alternatively, use the formula Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R). 

So, Δ = (7 * (z+4) * c)/ (4 * 8) = (7(z+4)c)/32. 

But also, from the formula using the sides and angles, Δ = (1/2) * a * b * sin C. 

Wait, but this is the same as above. 

No progress. 

Wait, but from earlier, we had an expression for PQ in terms of z. Let me revisit the equation from the sine formula:

7 = u * sqrt(1 - (v/16)^2) + v * sqrt(1 - (u/16)^2) 

With u = z + 4 and v = PQ. 

But this seems too abstract. Maybe try to guess the value of z from the answer choices. 

The answer choices are A.3, B.4, C.5, D.6. 

Let me test each possibility. 

Let's start with option C: z = 5. Then PR = z + 4 = 9. 

So, PR = 9, QR = 7. Let's see if this leads to consistent results. 

Assume PR = 9, so u = 9. 

Now, we have:

7 = 9 * sqrt(1 - (v/16)^2) + v * sqrt(1 - (9/16)^2) 

Compute sqrt(1 - (9/16)^2) = sqrt(1 - 81/256) = sqrt(175/256) = (sqrt(175))/16 = (5*sqrt(7))/16. 

So, the second term is v * (5√7)/16. 

First term: 9 * sqrt(1 - (v/16)^2). 

So, 7 = 9 * sqrt(1 - (v²/256)) + (5√7 v)/16. 

This is a complex equation, but let's try to estimate. 

Assume v is some value. Let me try to find v. 

Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines. With PR = 9, QR = 7, and R = 8. 

From earlier, the Law of Cosines equation:

49 = 9² + v² - 2*9*v*(sqrt(207)/16) 

Compute 9² = 81, so:

49 = 81 + v² - (18v * sqrt(207))/16 

Rearrange:

v² - (18v * sqrt(207))/16 + 81 -
