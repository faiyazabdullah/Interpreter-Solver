Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a cyclic quadrilateral WXYZ inscribed in a circle with center V. We need to find the measure of angle X. Let me start by recalling some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and angles in circles.

First, since the quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic quadrilateral. One key property of cyclic quadrilaterals is that the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180 degrees. Wait, but here they've given us some angles. Let me note down the given angles:

They mentioned Angle(W, V, Z) is 60 degrees. That seems like an angle at point V, so maybe that's a central angle? Because V is the center of the circle. Similarly, there are other angles given: Angle(W, Z, X) is 95 degrees, and Angle(W, Y, Z) is 30 degrees. Hmm, I need to visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points W, X, Y, Z lie on the circumference of the circle centered at V. The quadrilateral is WXYZ. The angles given involve points connected to V. For example, Angle(W, V, Z) would be the angle at V between points W and Z. Since V is the center, that angle would be a central angle subtended by arc WZ. 

Similarly, Angle(W, Z, X) is the angle at point Z between points W and X. So that's an inscribed angle? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, angle at Z formed by points W, Z, X. Since Z is on the circle, that angle would relate to the arcs it subtends. But how?

But first, let's recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Central angles are equal to their intercepted arcs. Also, in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. However, the angles given here aren't the usual internal angles of the quadrilateral; some are at the center, others at vertices.

Wait, let's clarify each angle:

1. Angle(W, V, Z): This is ∠WVZ, with vertex at V. Since V is the center, this is a central angle. Therefore, the measure of ∠WVZ equals the measure of arc WZ. So if that angle is 60°, then arc WZ is 60°.

2. Angle(W, Z, X): This is ∠WZX, with vertex at Z. Since Z is on the circumference, this is an inscribed angle. It intercepts arc WX. Wait, but wait—when you have an angle at Z between W and X, the intercepted arc would be arc WX that doesn't contain Z. So the measure of ∠WZX is half the measure of arc WX. Given that ∠WZX is 95°, so arc WX would be 190°? Wait, but that can't be because the total circumference is 360°, and arcs can't exceed that. Wait, 95° times 2 is 190°, which is possible. But maybe there's more to consider here.

3. Angle(W, Y, Z): This is ∠WYZ, with vertex at Y. Again, this is an inscribed angle. The intercepted arc would be arc WZ. Wait, no. If the angle is at Y between W and Z, then the intercepted arc is arc WZ that does not pass through Y. So the measure of ∠WYZ is half the measure of arc WZ. Wait, but earlier we had that arc WZ was 60°, from the central angle ∠WVZ = 60°. Then ∠WYZ should be half of that, so 30°, which matches the given value of 30°. Oh! So that checks out. That gives consistency.

So, arc WZ is 60°, so ∠WYZ is 30°, which matches the given. Good.

Now, moving forward. Our goal is to find angle X, which is ∠WXZ? Wait, the question says "Find m∠X". In the problem statement, Quadrilateral WXYZ. So angle at X. Which angle is that? The internal angle at vertex X of the quadrilateral. So that would be ∠ZXY or something? Wait, in quadrilateral WXYZ, the angles are at each vertex. So ∠X is the angle at point X between points W, X, Z. Wait, the order of the quadrilateral is W, X, Y, Z. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So the internal angle at X is between segments WX and XY. So the angle at X would be ∠WXY. Wait, but how do we compute that?

Alternatively, perhaps using cyclic quadrilateral properties. Remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. But these angles are the internal angles of the quadrilateral. However, the given angles are not directly those internal angles. Let me think again.

Wait, the given angles are:

- ∠WVZ = 60° (central angle over arc WZ)
- ∠WZX = 95° (at Z, between W and X)
- ∠WYZ = 30° (at Y, between W and Z)

We need to find ∠X, which is the internal angle at X of quadrilateral WXYZ.

To find ∠X, maybe we can use the fact that in cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. So if we can find another angle, say ∠Y, then ∠X + ∠Y = 180°. Alternatively, maybe we can compute ∠X using other angle relations.

But how do we connect the given angles to ∠X?

Let me try to find arcs corresponding to different parts.

From above, arc WZ is 60°, as per the central angle ∠WVZ=60°.

Also, ∠WZX is 95°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. Therefore, arc WX is 2*95° = 190°. Wait, but arc WX being 190°? Let me check if that's possible. The entire circle is 360°, so the sum of all arcs is 360°. So far, arc WZ is 60°, arc WX is 190°, but that already sums to 250°, leaving arcs for the rest. But maybe there's more to it. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, when considering ∠WZX, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. However, depending on where the points are placed, the intercepted arc could be major or minor. Since the measure is 95°, which is greater than 90°, the intercepted arc would be the major arc WX. Wait, but the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if ∠WZX is 95°, then the intercepted arc is 190°, which is indeed possible. So arc WX (the one not containing Z) is 190°, making the major arc WX. However, since the quadrilateral is WXYZ, the points are arranged around the circle. Let me imagine the circle with points W, X, Y, Z. Let me try to map the arcs.

Arc WX is 190°, arc WZ is 60°. Let me see if I can find other arcs. Also, ∠WYZ = 30°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WZ. As before, arc WZ is 60°, so that's consistent.

Now, the total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs is 360°. Let's denote the arcs between consecutive points:

Arc WX: 190°
Arc XY: ?
Arc YZ: ?
Arc ZW: 60°

But also, there's arc WZ which is 60°, but arc WZ can also be considered as arc W to Z passing through X and Y, but that would be the rest of the circle. Wait, maybe I need to consider the arcs between each pair of consecutive points.

Wait, the arcs between the points of the quadrilateral:

Between W and X: arc WX = 190°, as determined from ∠WZX.

Between X and Y: arc XY = ?

Between Y and Z: arc YZ = ?

Between Z and W: arc ZW = 60°.

Total arcs: 190° + arc XY + arc YZ + 60° = 360°, so arc XY + arc YZ = 360° - 190° - 60° = 110°.

Now, let's look for other angles or arcs. Maybe we can find arc XY or YZ using other given angles.

Looking at the other given angle: ∠WYZ = 30°, which we already used to confirm arc WZ is 60°. Are there other angles that can give us more arcs?

Alternatively, maybe looking at ∠WZX (which we used) and other angles.

Another approach: Let's consider the internal angles of the cyclic quadrilateral. Each internal angle is half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two opposite arcs.

Wait, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an internal angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two opposite angles. Wait, no, more accurately, each internal angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, let me recall.

For a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, the measure of angle A is half the measure of the arc BCD (the arc opposite angle A). Similarly, angle B is half the measure of arc ADC. So, for angle at X (∠X), which is part of quadrilateral WXYZ, it would be half the measure of the arc opposite to it. The arc opposite to ∠X would be the arc that doesn't contain X. So, arc WYZ.

Wait, arc WYZ is the arc from W to Z passing through Y. Since the total circle is 360°, arc WZ is 60°, so arc WYZ would be arc WY plus arc YZ. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

In general, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, for an inscribed angle, it's half the intercepted arc. But for an internal angle of a cyclic quadrilateral, it's half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, let me check.

Suppose we have cyclic quadrilateral WXYZ. The internal angle at X (∠X) intercepts arc WYZ. Because when you have angle at X, the sides are XW and XZ. Wait, no. Wait, the angle at X is between sides XW and XY. So, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite to angle X, i.e., arc WYZ. Therefore, measure of ∠X is half the measure of arc WYZ.

So, if I can find the measure of arc WYZ, then divide by 2 to get ∠X.

Arc WYZ consists of arc WY plus arc YZ. But how do we find arc WY and arc YZ?

Earlier, we found arc WX is 190°, arc ZW is 60°, and arc XY + arc YZ = 110°. Let me see if I can find arc YZ.

Alternatively, maybe consider other angles. Let me think about the angle at Y. Wait, but we don't know that yet. However, since we have arc WZ = 60°, and arc WX = 190°, maybe we can find other arcs.

Wait, let me think about the angle at Z. There's angle ∠WZX = 95°, which we already used. What about other angles? For instance, angle at Z between Y and X? Wait, but maybe not given. Alternatively, perhaps using triangle angles?

Wait, another idea: Let's consider triangle WZX. In triangle WZX, we know angle at Z is 95°, and we might know other angles or sides? Not sure. But maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since we know arc WX is 190°, and arc WZ is 60°, perhaps we can find other arcs.

Wait, if arc WX is 190°, then the remaining arcs (arc XY + arc YZ) is 110°, as computed earlier. Now, if we can find arc YZ, then we can find arc XY as well.

How to find arc YZ? Let's think of another angle. For example, angle at Y. Wait, but we don't have that given. However, we might derive it from other information.

Wait, there's another given angle: ∠WYZ = 30°, which we already used to find arc WZ. Is there another angle involving Y?

Alternatively, let's consider the angle at Y. Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, angle at Y would be half the measure of arc WXZ. Wait, angle at Y is between points W, Y, Z. So, it's an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. Wait, no. Wait, angle at Y between W and Z. So, the intercepted arc would be arc WX that doesn't contain Y. But since arc WX is 190°, then angle at Y would be half of that, which is 95°. Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, angle at Y is ∠WYZ. Wait, but earlier we said that ∠WYZ is 30°, which matched with arc WZ being 60°. So that suggests that my previous thought is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

If angle at Y is ∠WYZ, then that angle intercepts arc WZ. Because the angle is at Y between W and Z, so the intercepted arc is arc WZ. Hence, ∠WYZ = ½ * arc WZ => 30° = ½ * arc WZ => arc WZ = 60°, which matches our initial finding. So that's consistent.

Therefore, arc WZ is 60°, arc WX is 190°, and arc XY + arc YZ = 110°.

Now, let's consider another angle. Let me think about triangle XYZ or something. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, think about the other angles in the quadrilateral.

Since we're trying to find ∠X, which is half the measure of arc WYZ. Arc WYZ is arc WY + arc YZ. How do we find arc WY?

Well, arc WY can be found by adding arc WX + arc XY. Wait, arc WX is 190°, and arc XY is part of the remaining 110°. But unless we can find arc XY, we can't proceed. So, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, think about the other angles in the quadrilateral. For instance, angle at X is ∠X, which is half of arc WYZ. If we can express arc WYZ in terms of known arcs, maybe we can find it.

Arc WYZ is the same as arc WY + arc YZ. But arc WY is arc WX + arc XY minus arc X... Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Arc WYZ starts at W, goes through Y to Z. So, arc WY is from W to Y, and arc YZ is from Y to Z. So, arc WYZ = arc WY + arc YZ. But arc WY can be expressed as arc WX + arc XY? No, arc WY depends on the position of Y relative to W and X.

Alternatively, since the total circle is 360°, and we know arc WX is 190°, arc ZW is 60°, then the rest is arc XY + arc YZ = 110°, as before.

But how to find individual values of arc XY and arc YZ?

Maybe we need another equation. Let's consider another angle. For example, angle at X. Wait, but we don't know that yet. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have some relationships.

Wait, suppose we consider the arc XY and arc YZ. Their sum is 110°. Let me call arc XY = a, arc YZ = b. So a + b = 110°.

Now, if we can find another relationship between a and b, we can solve for them.

Is there another angle that relates to these arcs?

Let me consider angle at Z. The given angle at Z is ∠WZX = 95°, which we've already used. Are there other angles at Z?

Yes, angle at Z between Y and W. Wait, but that's ∠WZY, which is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, but that angle might be related to arc WX. Wait, no. Wait, angle at Z between Y and W would intercept arc XY. Because if you have angle at Z between Y and W, then the intercepted arc is arc XY. So, measure of ∠WZY is half of arc XY. 

Wait, but do we know ∠WZY? Let me check the given angles. The given angles were:

- ∠WVZ = 60° (central angle)
- ∠WZX = 95°
- ∠WYZ = 30°

Are there any other angles given? The problem mentions "Angle(W, Z, X)" which is ∠WZX = 95°, and "Angle(W, Y, Z)" which is ∠WYZ = 30°. So, ∠WZY is not given directly. But perhaps we can find it via other means.

Wait, angle at Z, which is part of the quadrilateral, is ∠XZY. Wait, no. The internal angle at Z of the quadrilateral is ∠XZY. But we have ∠WZX = 95°, which is part of that angle? Let me think.

At point Z, the internal angle of the quadrilateral is between points Y, Z, X. So, ∠YZX. Which is the angle between segments ZY and ZX. So, ∠YZX. This angle is made up of two parts? Not sure. But perhaps we can relate it to the arcs.

Alternatively, since we have ∠WZY (if that exists) being half of arc XY. Wait, but ∠WZY is the angle at Z between W and Y. So, that angle would intercept arc WX. Wait, earlier we said that ∠WYZ intercepts arc WZ. So ∠WZY intercepts arc WX. Therefore, measure of ∠WZY = ½ * arc WX = ½ * 190° = 95°. Wait, but ∠WZY would be 95°, but that's the same as ∠WZX, which is given as 95°. Wait, but that can't be unless those angles are the same, which they are not.

Wait, no. Wait, ∠WZX is the angle at Z between W and X, which intercepts arc WX. Whereas ∠WZY is the angle at Z between W and Y, which intercepts arc XY. So, ∠WZY = ½ * arc XY. But we don't know that value yet. However, if we can find ∠WZY, then we can find arc XY.

But how?

Wait, perhaps considering triangle WZX. In triangle WZX, we have angle at Z is 95°, and we might find other angles if we can find more info. But without knowing side lengths or other angles, it's tricky.

Alternatively, think about the entire quadrilateral. The sum of all internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. So, ∠W + ∠X + ∠Y + ∠Z = 360°. But these are internal angles of the quadrilateral. However, we need to find expressions for each of these angles.

Wait, for each internal angle of the cyclic quadrilateral:

- ∠W: At point W, which is between Z, W, X. So, ∠ZW X. This angle intercepts arc ZY. So measure of ∠W is ½ * arc ZY.
- ∠X: At point X, which intercepts arc WYZ. Measure is ½ * arc WYZ.
- ∠Y: At point Y, intercepts arc WXZ. Measure is ½ * arc WXZ.
- ∠Z: At point Z, intercepts arc WXY. Measure is ½ * arc WXY.

But since it's a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of ∠W + ∠X + ∠Y + ∠Z = 360°, and also, since each angle is half of an arc, their sum is ½*(sum of arcs). Sum of arcs is 360°, so sum of angles is 180°. Wait, that contradicts the earlier statement that the sum of internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. So there's inconsistency here. Wait, why?

Ah, because the formula for the sum of internal angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is indeed 360°, but according to the method above, it would be ½*(sum of arcs) = ½*(360°) = 180°, which is wrong. So my mistake must be in the assumption about which arcs are intercepted.

Let me double-check the intercepted arcs for each internal angle.

For angle at W (∠W), which is between Z, W, X. This angle intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is arc ZY. Wait, but the arc opposite to angle W would be arc ZY, yes. So measure of ∠W is ½ arc ZY.

Similarly, angle at X (∠X) intercepts arc WYZ. Measure is ½ arc WYZ.

Angle at Y (∠Y) intercepts arc WXZ. Measure is ½ arc WXZ.

Angle at Z (∠Z) intercepts arc WXY. Measure is ½ arc WXY.

Then, sum of angles:

∠W + ∠X + ∠Y + ∠Z = ½(arc ZY + arc WYZ + arc WXZ + arc WXY).

But arc ZY + arc WYZ = arc ZY + arc WY + arc YZ = arc ZY + arc WY + arc YZ = arc ZY + arc WY + arc YZ. Wait, this seems messy. Let me think of the entire arcs.

Actually, arc ZY is the same as arc ZY. Arc WYZ is arc WY + arc YZ. Arc WXZ is arc WX + arc XZ. Arc WXY is arc WX + arc XY. Adding all these arcs together:

arc ZY + arc WYZ + arc WXZ + arc WXY = arc ZY + (arc WY + arc YZ) + (arc WX + arc XZ) + (arc WX + arc XY).

This seems complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let me think again about the total.

Each arc is counted once in the sum. But since the whole circle is 360°, the sum of all these arcs would be 360° multiplied by something. Wait, maybe not. Let me instead notice that each arc is included in the sum multiple times. So this approach may not work.

Alternative approach: Let's use the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum of internal angles is 360°, and if opposite angles are supplementary, then each pair adds to 180°, leading to total sum of 360°. Yes, that's correct. So ∠W + ∠X = 180°, and ∠Y + ∠Z = 180°.

So, if I can find ∠W and ∠Z, or ∠Y and ∠Z, I can find the others.

Let me try to find ∠W and ∠Z.

Starting with ∠W: It's the internal angle at W, which intercepts arc ZY. So measure of ∠W is ½ arc ZY.

Similarly, ∠Z is the internal angle at Z, which intercepts arc WXY. Measure is ½ arc WXY.

But what is arc ZY? From earlier, arc ZY is arc Z to Y. Since arc ZW is 60°, and arc WX is 190°, arc XY + arc YZ = 110°, then arc ZY would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, arc ZY is from Z to Y. Depending on the direction.

Assuming the quadrilateral is ordered W-X-Y-Z-W around the circle. So, moving from Z back to W would go through Y and X. So arc ZY would be arc Z to Y going through X. So arc ZY would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, arc ZY is from Z to Y. If the points are W, X, Y, Z in order around the circle, then from Z to Y would go through X. So arc ZY is arc Z to X to Y, which is arc ZX + arc XY. Wait, but arc Z to X is arc ZW + arc WX? No, arc Z to X would depend on the direction. Maybe it's easier to calculate arc ZY as follows:

Total circle is 360°, and we know arc WX = 190°, arc ZW = 60°, and arc XY + arc YZ = 110°. Let me try to find arc ZY.

If I can express arc ZY in terms of known quantities. Let's assume the order of the points is W -> X -> Y -> Z -> W around the circle.

So, starting from Z, going counterclockwise to Y would pass through X and W? No, if the order is W, X, Y, Z, then from Z, going counterclockwise would go to W. So arc ZY would be arc Z to Y going through W and X. Wait, that would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, arc ZY would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? Let me draw it mentally.

Imagine the circle with points labeled clockwise as W, X, Y, Z. So from Z, going clockwise to Y would be along arc ZY. But if the order is W, X, Y, Z clockwise, then from Z, going clockwise to Y would require going backward through the circle. So arc ZY would be the shorter arc from Z to Y, which might be arc ZY going through X? Or through W?

It's getting confusing. Maybe we need to assign variables to the arcs.

Let me define:

Arc WX = 190° (from earlier)
Arc XY = a
Arc YZ = b
Arc ZW = 60°

With a + b = 110°, as before.

Now, arc ZY: from Z to Y. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then arc ZY going the short way would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, that would be longer. Alternatively, arc ZY going the other way is arc ZY = arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, that's too long. Alternatively, arc ZY is arc Z to Y directly, which would be arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? Or maybe arc ZY = arc ZW + arc WY?

Wait, arc WY is from W to Y, which would be arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a. But arc ZY would be arc Z to Y. If we take the arc from Z to Y that doesn't pass through W, it would be arc ZY = arc ZW + arc WY? No, arc ZY would be arc Z to Y via the other side. Since the total circle is 360°, arc ZY can also be calculated as 360° - arc WZ - arc WX - arc XY? Not sure.

Alternatively, since arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y. If we take the arc that passes through X and W, it would be arc ZX + arc XY. Arc ZX is arc ZW + arc WX? No, arc ZX is from Z to X. Since arc ZW is 60°, and arc WX is 190°, then arc ZX is arc ZW + arc WX = 60° + 190° = 250°? Wait, that seems large. But if arc ZX is 250°, then the arc from Z to X going the other way would be 360° - 250° = 110°, which would be arc ZY + arc YX? Not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think of another approach. Since we have ∠W and ∠Z, which are parts of the cyclic quadrilateral.

Earlier, we found that ∠WYZ = 30°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WZ (60°). Now, what about ∠Z? The internal angle at Z. How can we find it?

The internal angle at Z is ∠YZX, which is the angle between segments YZ and ZX. To find this angle, we can use the fact that it intercepts arc WXY. So measure of ∠Z is ½ arc WXY.

What is arc WXY? Arc from W to X to Y. That would be arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a.

Thus, measure of ∠Z = ½ (190° + a).

Similarly, ∠W is the internal angle at W, which intercepts arc ZY. Arc ZY is from Z to Y. Assuming the arc that doesn't pass through X, it would be arc ZY = arc ZW + arc WY. Arc WY is arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a. Thus, arc ZY = arc ZW + arc WY = 60° + 190° + a = 250° + a? No, that can't be, since total circle is 360°. Wait, this seems off. Let me think again.

If arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y that doesn't pass through X, then it would be arc ZW + arc WY. But arc WY is arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a. So arc ZY = 60° + 190° + a = 250° + a? But that would make the total of arc ZY + arc WX + arc XY + ... exceeding 360°, which isn't possible. Clearly, there's confusion here.

Perhaps I need to reconsider the definition of arc ZY. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y that goes through X. So it would be arc Z to X to Y. Arc Z to X is arc ZW + arc WX = 60° + 190° = 250°, and then arc XY is a. So total arc ZY is 250° + a. But since the total circle is 360°, arc ZY = 250° + a, and arc YZ = b, which is the other arc from Y to Z. Wait, but arc YZ is just b, which is part of the 110°.

This seems inconsistent. Let me try plugging in numbers. Suppose a + b = 110°. Let's assume arc XY = a, arc YZ = b.

If arc ZY (the larger arc) is 250° + a, then the smaller arc ZY would be 360° - (250° + a) = 110° - a. But arc ZY is supposed to be the arc that corresponds to ∠W, which intercepts it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since ∠W is ½ arc ZY, and we don't know arc ZY, but maybe we can find it via other means.

Let me think about the other given angles. We know that ∠WZX = 95°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX = 190°, as before. And ∠WYZ = 30°, which intercepts arc WZ = 60°.

But what about the other angles? Let me think about triangle WZX. In triangle WZX, we know angle at Z is 95°, and we might find other angles if we can find the other arcs.

Wait, in triangle WZX, the three angles are ∠W, ∠X, and ∠Z. Wait, but ∠W is part of the quadrilateral, not sure.

Alternatively, consider the angles at point Z. At point Z, there are two angles: ∠WZX = 95° and ∠WZY, which we discussed earlier. These two angles form the internal angle at Z of the quadrilateral. Wait, no. The internal angle at Z is ∠YZX, which is composed of ∠WZX and ∠WZY? Or is it just one angle?

No, the internal angle at Z is ∠YZX, which is between points Y, Z, X. So, it's a single angle. But we have ∠WZX = 95°, which is between W, Z, X. So, if we consider ∠WZX and ∠WZY, they are adjacent angles at Z, forming the internal angle ∠YZX?

Wait, no. ∠WZX is between W, Z, X. ∠WZY is between W, Z, Y. So, these two angles share the side ZW. So, together, they form the angle at Z between Y, Z, X, which is ∠YZX. Wait, no. If you have angle between WZ and ZX (∠WZX = 95°) and angle between WZ and ZY (∠WZY), then together they would form the angle at Z between YZ and ZX, which is ∠YZX. So, ∠YZX = ∠WZX + ∠WZY?

Wait, no. If you have two angles at point Z: one between WZ and ZX (∠WZX = 95°) and another between WZ and ZY (∠WZY). But those two angles are adjacent and add up to ∠YZX. Wait, ∠YZX is the angle between YZ and ZX. So, if you have ∠WZY (between WZ and ZY) and ∠WZX (between WZ and ZX), then together they form the angle between ZY and ZX, which is ∠YZX. So ∠YZX = ∠WZY + ∠WZX?

Wait, no. If you have two angles at Z: one between WZ and ZX (∠WZX), and another between WZ and ZY (∠WZY), then the angle between ZY and ZX would be ∠WZY + ∠WZX if they are on opposite sides of WZ. But since Z is on the circle, and assuming the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then ∠WZX and ∠WZY are on the same side of WZ, so they would subtract. Wait, this is confusing without a diagram.

Let me think carefully. Point Z is on the circle. The segment WZ connects Z to W, and segment ZX connects Z to X, and segment ZY connects Z to Y. So, at point Z, there are three rays: ZW, ZX, and ZY. The angle between ZW and ZX is ∠WZX = 95°, and the angle between ZW and ZY is ∠WZY. The angle between ZX and ZY is ∠YZX, which is the internal angle at Z of the quadrilateral. So, if we know ∠WZX and ∠WZY, then ∠YZX = |∠WZX - ∠WZY| or something? Depends on the configuration.

But we don't know ∠WZY. However, ∠WZY is an inscribed angle intercepting arc XY. Earlier, I thought that ∠WZY = ½ arc XY. So if we can find ∠WZY, we can find arc XY.

But how?

Let me assume that ∠YZX (internal angle at Z) is equal to ∠WZX + ∠WZY or something. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, since we know that ∠YZX is the internal angle at Z of the cyclic quadrilateral, and we also know that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of ∠Z and ∠W is 180°, because opposite angles are supplementary.

Wait, if I can find ∠W, then I can find ∠Z, since ∠W + ∠Z = 180°.

Let me try to find ∠W. ∠W is the internal angle at W, which intercepts arc ZY. So, ∠W = ½ arc ZY.

If I can find arc ZY, then I can find ∠W.

But arc ZY is the arc from Z to Y. Let me think about the total circle. Total arc is 360°. We have arc WX = 190°, arc ZW = 60°, and arc XY + arc YZ = 110°. So, arc ZY is arc ZW + arc WX + arc XY? No, arc ZY would be arc Z to Y. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then arc ZY is arc Z to Y going through X, which is arc ZX + arc XY. Arc ZX is arc ZW + arc WX = 60° + 190° = 250°, and arc XY is a. So arc ZY = 250° + a. But since arc ZY is part of the circle, it must be less than 360°. So, 250° + a < 360° → a < 110°, which is true since a + b = 110°.

But then, ∠W = ½ arc ZY = ½ (250° + a). 

But we also know that ∠W + ∠Z = 180°, and ∠Z = ½ arc WXY. Arc WXY is arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a. So ∠Z = ½ (190° + a).

So, substituting:

∠W + ∠Z = ½ (250° + a) + ½ (190° + a) = [250 + a + 190 + a]/2 = (440 + 2a)/2 = 220 + a = 180°.

So, 220 + a = 180 → a = -40°, which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here, indicating a mistake in assumptions.

Where did I go wrong? Let me trace back.

I assumed that arc ZY = arc ZX + arc XY = 250° + a. But this assumes that arc ZY is the arc going through X, which might not be the case. Maybe arc ZY is the smaller arc, so it's 360° - (250° + a) = 110° - a. Let me try that.

If arc ZY is the smaller arc, then arc ZY = 360° - (arc ZX + arc XY). But arc ZX is arc ZW + arc WX = 60° + 190° = 250°, and arc XY is a. So arc ZY = 360° - (250° + a) = 110° - a.

Then, ∠W = ½ arc ZY = ½ (110° - a).

And ∠Z = ½ arc WXY = ½ (arc WX + arc XY) = ½ (190° + a).

Then, ∠W + ∠Z = ½ (110° - a) + ½ (190° + a) = ½ (110° - a + 190° + a) = ½ (300°) = 150°, which is not 180°, still conflicting. So this approach is flawed.

Clearly, there's a mistake in how I'm defining the intercepted arcs. Let me revisit the concept of intercepted arcs for internal angles in cyclic quadrilaterals.

For an internal angle at a vertex of a cyclic quadrilateral, it is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc opposite to it. For example, at vertex W, the internal angle intercepts the arc opposite to W, which is arc YZ. Similarly, at vertex Z, the internal angle intercepts arc WX.

Wait, this might be the key. Let me recheck:

In a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. So:

- ∠W intercepts arc YZ
- ∠X intercepts arc YZ?
Wait, no. Let me think again. For a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, the internal angle at A intercepts the arc opposite to A, which is arc BCD. So for quadrilateral WXYZ, the internal angle at W intercepts arc XYZ, the internal angle at X intercepts arc YZW, the internal angle at Y intercepts arc WXZ, and the internal angle at Z intercepts arc WXY.

So, for ∠W, it intercepts arc XYZ. For ∠X, it intercepts arc YZW. For ∠Y, it intercepts arc WXZ. For ∠Z, it intercepts arc WXY.

Thus, measure of ∠W = ½ arc XYZ, ∠X = ½ arc YZW, ∠Y = ½ arc WXZ, ∠Z = ½ arc WXY.

Now, let's calculate these arcs.

First, arc XYZ: from X to Y to Z. Since the points are W, X, Y, Z in order, arc XYZ is arc XY + arc YZ = a + b = 110°, as before.

Measure of ∠W = ½ * 110° = 55°.

Next, arc YZW: from Y to Z to W. This is arc YZ + arc ZW = b + 60°.

Measure of ∠X = ½ (b + 60°).

Arc WXZ: from W to X to Z. This is arc WX + arc XZ. Arc XZ is arc X to Z. Since arc X to Z can be calculated as arc WX + arc XY + arc YZ? No, arc XZ is arc from X to Z. If points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then arc XZ is arc X to Z going through Y, which is arc XY + arc YZ = a + b = 110°. So arc WXZ is arc WX + arc XZ = 190° + 110° = 300°. Wait, no. Arc WXZ is from W to X to Z, which is arc WX + arc XZ. Arc XZ is arc from X to Z, which is arc XY + arc YZ = a + b = 110°. So arc WXZ is arc WX + arc XZ = 190° + 110° = 300°. Therefore, measure of ∠Y = ½ * 300° = 150°.

Similarly, arc WXY: from W to X to Y, which is arc WX + arc XY = 190° + a. So measure of ∠Z = ½ (190° + a).

Now, since in a cyclic quadrilateral, ∠W + ∠X = 180°, and ∠Y + ∠Z = 180°.

From above, ∠W = 55°, so ∠X = 180° - 55° = 125°. But wait, this would mean that ∠X is 125°, which is not among the options. Wait, the options are A. 85, B. 95, C. 115, D. 120. So 125 is not there. But this suggests an error in calculation.

Wait, let me verify the calculations again.

First, arc XYZ: from X to Y to Z. Since the points are W, X, Y, Z, arc XYZ is arc XY + arc YZ = a + b = 110°, so ∠W = ½ * 110° = 55°. Correct.

Then, arc YZW: from Y to Z to W. This is arc YZ + arc ZW = b + 60°. So ∠X = ½ (b + 60°). 

Arc WXZ: from W to X to Z. This is arc WX + arc XZ. Arc XZ is arc from X to Z
