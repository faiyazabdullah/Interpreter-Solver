MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, given that the arc BC measures 30 degrees and arc AD measures 20 degrees. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and what they mean.

First, there's a circle O with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G on it. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral, probably a cyclic quadrilateral since all points lie on the same circle. There are arcs mentioned: arc BD, arc BC, arc AD. Wait, the problem mentions arc BC and arc AD specifically. Also, there's an inscribed angle Angle(2) which is related to arc BD. 

Wait, the predicate says InscribedAngle(Angle(2), Arc(B,D)). That means angle 2 is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BD. I remember that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle 2 intercepts arc BD, then m∠2 = ½ × m(arc BD). But I need to find m(arc BD) first.

But how do I find arc BD? The given arcs are arc BC = 30° and arc AD = 20°. Let me visualize the circle with points A, B, C, D arranged such that arcs BC and AD are given. Since ABCD is part of the circle, maybe these arcs are parts of the circumference. Let me think about the total circumference. The entire circle is 360°, so the sum of all arcs should add up to 360°. However, we have arcs BC and AD given, but what about the other arcs?

Let me try to map out the arcs. Starting from point A, moving around the circle. The arcs mentioned are arc BC (from B to C), arc AD (from A to D). Wait, maybe the arcs are adjacent. For example, arc BC would be between B and C, arc AD between A and D. But without knowing the order of the points on the circle, this could be tricky. However, the lines AB, BC, CD, DA suggest that the quadrilateral is connected in order, so the points are arranged in the order A-B-C-D-A around the circle. Therefore, the arcs between consecutive points would be arc AB, arc BC, arc CD, arc DA. But wait, the given arcs are BC and AD. Hmm.

Wait, arc BC is one of the sides of the quadrilateral, so that's the arc from B to C. Similarly, arc AD is from A to D. But since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the arcs between each pair of consecutive points make up the circle. So the total circumference is arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°. But we know arc BC is 30° and arc AD is 20°. But we don't know arcs AB and CD yet. However, perhaps there's another way to relate arc BD?

Arc BD would span from B to D. Depending on the direction, it could be the shorter arc or longer arc. But since angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, we need to figure out which arc it's referring to. Typically, unless specified otherwise, inscribed angles refer to the arc that's opposite the angle, so the arc that doesn't contain the angle's vertex. 

Alternatively, maybe arc BD passes through points B to D, passing through C? Or going the other way around? Let me consider the arrangement again. If the points are in order A-B-C-D-A on the circle, then arc BD would consist of two arcs: one passing through C (arc BCD) and the other passing through A (arc BAD). The measure of arc BD depends on which arc we take. However, since angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, and assuming it's the arc that doesn't contain the center, but depending on where the angle is located.

Wait, angle 2 is associated with the arc BD. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. But here, angle 2 is an inscribed angle, not necessarily an angle of the quadrilateral. Wait, looking back at the predicates, there are angles listed as Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,D), etc., which are angles formed by three points. The inscribed angle Angle(2) is likely one of those angles. Wait, the problem states "InscribedAngle(Angle(2), Arc(B,D))", which suggests that angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. So, if angle 2 is formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference, and intercepting arc BD.

So, if I can find the measure of arc BD, then angle 2 is half of that. Now, how do I find arc BD?

Since the circle has points A, B, C, D arranged consecutively, arc BD would cover from B to D. Let's imagine the circle divided into four arcs: AB, BC, CD, DA. Given that arc BC is 30°, arc DA is 20°, and the total is 360°, so arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°. We know BC=30°, DA=20°, so arc AB + arc CD = 360 - 30 - 20 = 310°. But we don't know individual values for arc AB and arc CD. However, maybe arc BD can be expressed in terms of other arcs.

Arc BD can be broken down as arc BC + arc CD, which would be 30° + arc CD. Alternatively, if we go the other way around from B to D via A, it would be arc BA + arc AD. Which is arc AB + arc AD. Wait, arc BA is the same as arc AB but in the opposite direction. But since arcs are typically considered as the smaller arc unless stated otherwise, but since the problem gives arc BC and arc AD, maybe we need to check which arc BD is being referred to.

Assuming that the arc BD is the one that doesn't pass through C, i.e., the arc going through A. Then arc BD would be arc BA + arc AD. Arc BA is the same as arc AB. So arc BD (the other way) would be arc AB + arc AD. But since arc AD is given as 20°, then arc BD would be arc AB + 20°. However, we don't know arc AB. Alternatively, if arc BD is the arc that goes through C, then it would be arc BC + arc CD = 30° + arc CD. But we still don't know arc CD.

Wait, but maybe there's more information. Let me check if there are other arcs mentioned. The problem also includes arcs like arc AB, arc BC, arc CD, arc DA. Wait, the Arc(A,B,C) would imply arc from A to B passing through C? No, usually arc notation is from the first to the last point, so Arc(A,B,C) would be arc AC passing through B. But in standard notation, arc ABC would be the major arc or minor arc depending on the points. Maybe the problem uses Arc(A,B,C) to denote the arc starting at A, ending at C, passing through B. So, for example, Arc(A,B,C) is the arc from A to C through B. Similarly, Arc(B,C,D) is arc from B to D through C, etc. So the arcs given are:

Arc(A,B,C): arc from A to C through B (so this would be arc AB + arc BC)
Arc(B,C,D): arc from B to D through C (arc BC + arc CD)
Arc(C,D,A): arc from C to A through D (arc CD + arc DA)
Arc(D,A,B): arc from D to B through A (arc DA + arc AB)

But the problem states that m(arc BC) = 30°, and m(arc AD) = 20°. Wait, but arc BC is part of arc BCD, which is arc BC + CD. But arc BC itself is given as 30°, so maybe arc BC refers to the arc between B and C, which is part of the circle. Similarly, arc AD is the arc between A and D, which is given as 20°.

So, if we consider the arcs:

arc BC = 30°
arc AD = 20°
Then, the rest of the arcs (AB and CD) are unknown. Let me denote arc AB as x and arc CD as y. Then, total circumference:

x + 30 + y + 20 = 360 → x + y = 310°.

Now, the arc BD that's being referred to in the inscribed angle. Let me think about how arc BD is formed. From point B to D, there are two arcs: one going through C (which would be arc BC + arc CD = 30 + y) and the other going through A (arc BA + arc AD = x + 20). Since angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, we need to determine which arc it's referring to. In typical problems, unless specified, the intercepted arc is the one that's not containing the angle's vertex. But angle 2's position isn't directly given, but perhaps based on the other angles mentioned in the predicates.

Looking back, the predicates mention angles like Angle(A,B,C), which is the angle at point B formed by points A, B, C. So, angle ABC. Similarly, Angle(B,C,D) is angle at C formed by points B, C, D. These angles are inscribed angles in the circle. Wait, but angle ABC is formed by chords AB and BC, so it intercepts arc ADC. Because in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at a vertex intercepts the arc opposite to it. For example, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC. Similarly, angle BCD intercepts arc BAD, etc.

But in our case, the inscribed angle Angle(2) is intercepting arc BD. So, perhaps angle 2 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of two chords that intercept arc BD. For instance, if angle 2 is formed by chords connecting points that intercept arc BD. Without knowing the exact location of angle 2, it's a bit ambiguous, but given that the problem mentions Angle(2) with the arc BD, we can proceed with the relationship that angle 2 is half the measure of arc BD.

Therefore, m∠2 = ½ × m(arc BD). Now, the challenge is determining m(arc BD). As earlier, arc BD can be either the arc going through C (BC + CD = 30 + y) or through A (BA + AD = x + 20). But since x + y = 310°, substituting, if we take arc BD through C: 30 + y. And arc BD through A: x + 20. However, since the total circumference is 360°, the larger arc BD would be 360° minus the smaller arc BD. But since angle 2 is an inscribed angle, it must intercept the arc that's less than 180°, because inscribed angles are always less than 90° if intercepting a semicircle. Wait, no, inscribed angles can be obtuse if they intercept arcs greater than 180°, but the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc regardless. However, the problem may assume that the intercepted arc is the minor arc BD.

But since we don't know whether arc BD through C or through A is minor, we need more info. However, given that arc BC is 30° and arc AD is 20°, maybe we can express arc BD in terms of known quantities.

Wait, let's think differently. Since the quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic, the sum of the measures of opposite arcs is 180°? Wait, no, that applies to opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral, not arcs. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180°, but that relates to the angles, not directly the arcs. However, each angle in the quadrilateral is an inscribed angle intercepting an arc. For example, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC, which would be arc AD + arc DC. Wait, arc ADC is arc AD plus arc DC. But arc AD is given as 20°, and arc DC is y. So arc ADC is 20 + y. Therefore, angle ABC = ½ × (arc ADC) = ½ (20 + y). Similarly, angle BCD intercepts arc BAD, which is arc BA + arc AD = x + 20. So angle BCD = ½ (x + 20).

But we don't have the measures of angles ABC or BCD. However, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of angle ABC and angle CDA is 180°, since they are opposite angles. Wait, angle ABC and angle CDA are opposite angles. Let me confirm: in cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, angle ABC and angle CDA are opposite. Their sum is 180°. So:

angle ABC + angle CDA = 180°.

Similarly, angle BCD + angle DAB = 180°.

But angle ABC is ½ (arc ADC) = ½ (arc AD + arc DC) = ½ (20 + y).

Angle CDA is the angle at D, formed by points C, D, A. This angle intercepts arc ABC, which is arc AB + arc BC = x + 30. So angle CDA = ½ (x + 30).

Thus, angle ABC + angle CDA = ½ (20 + y) + ½ (x + 30) = ½ (x + y + 50) = ½ (310 + 50) = ½ (360) = 180°, which checks out. So that works.

But how does this help us? Well, since we don't have specific angle measures, but we need to find angle 2, which is intercepting arc BD. Let me try to find arc BD.

Earlier, I thought arc BD could be either (arc BC + arc CD) = 30 + y, or (arc AB + arc AD) = x + 20. Since x + y = 310°, then:

If arc BD is 30 + y, then since x = 310 - y, substituting into the other expression:

arc BD through A: x + 20 = 310 - y + 20 = 330 - y.

But since arc BD can be either 30 + y or 330 - y. However, the measure of an arc can't exceed 360°, so 30 + y < 360, but since x + y = 310, and y is positive, so y < 310. Hence, 30 + y < 340°, which is possible. But which one is the correct arc BD?

Well, in the absence of specific information, perhaps we need to consider that angle 2 is formed by two chords that intercept arc BD. Let me think about the possible positions. For example, if angle 2 is formed by points A, B, and some other point, but the problem states that angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. Since the problem lists several angles: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,D), etc., but angle 2 is separate. Perhaps angle 2 is another angle in the diagram, like Angle(A,B,D) or something else.

Alternatively, considering that the inscribed angle Angle(2) is related to arc BD. Let me consider that if arc BD is the arc that doesn't include point C, then it's arc BAD, which would be arc BA + arc AD = x + 20. But since x + y = 310, then arc BD (BAD) is x + 20. Alternatively, if it's arc BCD, which is arc BC + arc CD = 30 + y.

But how do I choose between them? Let's consider the possibility that angle 2 is formed by two chords that intercept arc BD. Suppose angle 2 is formed by points B and D, with the vertex somewhere on the circumference. For example, if angle 2 is at point E or F or G, but the problem doesn't specify. However, since there are points E, F, G on the circle, but their positions aren't given. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is one of the angles already mentioned. Wait, the predicates list angles like Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,D), etc. But the problem specifies Angle(2) as an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. So, perhaps angle 2 is another angle not explicitly named in the predicates. But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, since the problem gives arc BC = 30° and arc AD = 20°, maybe there's a way to find arc BD using those.

Wait, suppose arc BD is the arc that spans from B to D passing through C. Then arc BD = arc BC + arc CD = 30 + y. But since arc CD is y, and arc AB is x = 310 - y. Alternatively, if arc BD is passing through A, then it's arc BA + arc AD = x + 20. But how can we find the measure of arc BD?

Perhaps there's another relationship. Let me think about the total circumference again. Total circumference is 360°, so:

arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°
x + 30 + y + 20 = 360
x + y = 310°

We need to find arc BD. Let's assume that arc BD is the arc that doesn't pass through C, so it's arc BAD. Then arc BD = arc BA + arc AD = x + 20. But we don't know x. However, we can express x in terms of y, since x = 310 - y. Substituting, arc BD = 310 - y + 20 = 330 - y. But that still leaves us with an unknown variable y.

Alternatively, if arc BD is the arc passing through C, then arc BD = 30 + y. Again, unknown y. So how can we find y?

Wait, maybe there's another arc given indirectly. Let me look back at the problem statement. It mentions arcs like Arc(A,B,C), Arc(B,C,D), Arc(C,D,A), Arc(D,A,B). These arcs are the arcs that go through the intermediate points. For example, Arc(A,B,C) is arc AC passing through B, which would be arc AB + arc BC. Similarly, Arc(B,C,D) is arc BD passing through C, which is arc BC + arc CD. Arc(C,D,A) is arc CA passing through D, which is arc CD + arc DA. Arc(D,A,B) is arc DB passing through A, which is arc DA + arc AB.

Given that, the problem mentions arc BC = 30°, which is part of arc BCD (arc BC + CD). Similarly, arc AD = 20°, which is part of arc DAB (arc DA + AB). Wait, but the problem says "m arc BC = 30" and "m arc AD = 20". Does that mean the measure of arc BC is 30°, and arc AD is 20°, as individual arcs?

Yes, that seems to be the case. So arc BC = 30°, arc AD = 20°. Therefore, arc BC is just the arc between B and C, not including other points, so it's 30°, and arc AD is 20°, between A and D.

Now, let's consider arc BD. If arc BD is the arc passing through C, then it's arc BC + arc CD = 30 + y. If it's the arc passing through A, it's arc DA + arc AB = 20 + x. But how to find y or x?

Wait, but there's another arc mentioned implicitly. For example, arc AB is part of arc DAB (arc DA + AB). But we don't have its measure. However, if we can find another equation involving x and y.

Wait, but we only have one equation: x + y = 310°. So we need another relation to find x or y. Is there anything else given?

Looking back at the predicates, there are points E, F, G on the circle, but their positions are not specified. Also, the lines AB, BC, CD, DA are chords of the circle. Are there any other arcs mentioned? The problem mentions arcs like Arc(A,B,C), Arc(B,C,D), etc., but none of their measures are given except for arc BC and arc AD. So perhaps we need to use the fact that the arcs make up the whole circle.

But without more information, it seems we cannot determine x and y uniquely. So maybe there's a different approach. Let me reconsider the measure of angle 2. Since it's an inscribed angle over arc BD, and we need to find its measure. If we can express arc BD in terms of known arcs, perhaps using the given arcs BC and AD.

Wait, let me think: arc BC is 30°, arc AD is 20°. What is the measure of arc BD? If we traverse from B to D through C, it's arc BC + arc CD = 30 + y. If we traverse from B to D through A, it's arc BA + arc AD = x + 20. But since x + y = 310°, we can write arc BD (through A) as x + 20 = (310 - y) + 20 = 330 - y. 

But how do we find the value of arc BD? Unless there's a relationship between arcs BC and AD that allows us to find arc BD. Wait, maybe the arcs BC and AD are parts of the circle that allow us to compute the remaining arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc BD is the difference between arc BC and arc AD? Not sure. Or maybe there's a way to express arc BD in terms of arc BC and arc AD. Let me try to imagine the circle with points A, B, C, D arranged in order. So the arcs between each consecutive pair are AB, BC, CD, DA. Given arc BC = 30°, arc DA = 20°. Let me attempt to calculate arc BD.

From point B to D, the arc passing through C is BC + CD = 30 + y. The other arc is BA + AD = x + 20. The sum of these two arcs is (30 + y) + (x + 20) = x + y + 50 = 310 + 50 = 360°, which makes sense since they are the two arcs between B and D. Therefore, arc BD can be either 30 + y or x + 20, and their sum is 360°. So, if we can find one of these, we can find the other. But since we don't have specific values for x or y, this seems stuck.

However, maybe there's another insight. Since angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, and if we can relate it to other angles or arcs. For example, if angle 2 is part of the quadrilateral or related to other angles. 

Wait, let me consider that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if angle 2 is intercepting arc BD, then m∠2 = ½ * m(arc BD). To find m(arc BD), we need to know its measure. But without knowing x or y, how can we proceed?

Maybe there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the given arcs. The problem says "m arc BC = 30" and "m arc AD = 20". Maybe these are not the arcs between the points, but the arcs corresponding to the arcs mentioned in the predicates. For example, arc BC is part of the arc from B to C, which is given as 30°, and arc AD is part of the arc from A to D, which is 20°. 

Wait, but in the circle, arc BC is 30°, arc AD is 20°, and the other arcs are AB and CD. If I can find the measure of arc BD by combining these. For example, if I consider that arc BD is made up of arc BC + arc CD (30 + y) or arc AD + arc AB (20 + x). But since x + y = 310°, we can substitute:

arc BD (through C) = 30 + y = 30 + (310 - x) = 340 - x
arc BD (through A) = x + 20

But without knowing x, I'm stuck. Is there any other information I missed?

Wait, maybe the arcs mentioned in the predicates are the ones that are labeled. For example, arc BC is given as 30°, and arc AD is given as 20°. Are there other arcs mentioned? The problem also mentions arcs like Arc(A,B,C), Arc(B,C,D), etc., but their measures are not given. However, perhaps these arcs are the ones that are used in calculating other angles. 

Wait, the problem mentions that angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. So, if I can find the measure of arc BD in terms of other arcs. Let me try to see:

Total circumference is 360°, so:

arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°
arc AB + arc CD = 360 - 30 - 20 = 310°

Now, arc BD can be represented as arc BC + arc CD = 30 + arc CD, or arc AB + arc AD = arc AB + 20.

But since arc AB + arc CD = 310°, if we call arc AB = a and arc CD = b, then a + b = 310°. 

So, arc BD through C is 30 + b, and through A is a + 20. But we need to determine which one is the intercepted arc for angle 2. Assuming that angle 2 is formed by points that make arc BD the minor arc, but we don't know. However, since arc BC is 30° and arc AD is 20°, which are relatively small, maybe arc BD through C is larger than arc BD through A. 

For example, if arc BD through C is 30 + b, and through A is a + 20. Since a + b = 310°, then:

If we consider arc BD through C: 30 + b = 30 + (310 - a) = 340 - a.

And arc BD through A: a + 20.

But without knowing a, we can't determine which is larger. However, if we assume that angle 2 intercepts the arc that is not containing the center, or is the smaller arc. But without more info, this is speculative.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since angle 2 is an inscribed angle, and the problem gives us arc BC and arc AD, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of arcs BC and AD is 50°, and somehow relate it to arc BD. 

Wait, let me think: if arc BC is 30°, arc AD is 20°, then if we consider the arcs that make up the circle, maybe arc BD can be found by adding or subtracting these. For example, if arc BD is arc BC + arc AD = 30 + 20 = 50°, but that assumes that arc BD is composed of arc BC and arc AD, which might not be the case. 

But why would that be? If arc BD is the combination of arc BC and arc AD, that would require that points B, C, D, A are arranged such that arc BC and arc AD are adjacent. But in a cyclic quadrilateral, the points are in order A-B-C-D-A. So, arc BC is between B and C, and arc AD is between A and D. If you go from B to D, passing through C, it's arc BC + CD. Passing through A, it's arc BA + AD. So, arc BC and arc AD are not directly connected. 

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem for any overlooked details. The problem gives arc BC = 30°, arc AD = 20°, and asks for angle 2 which is an inscribed angle over arc BD. Perhaps there's a property I haven't considered yet. 

Wait! Let me think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°. If we can find the measure of arc BD, then angle 2 is half of that. Let me consider that arc BD is the sum of arc BC and arc AD. But why would that be the case? Because if arc BC is 30° and arc AD is 20°, then adding them gives 50°, which could be arc BD. But that would only be true if arc BD is composed of arc BC and arc AD, which requires that points C and A are positioned such that arc BC and arc AD are adjacent. But in the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, arc BC is between B and C, arc AD is between A and D. So, if you go from B to D, it passes through C, which adds arc BC and CD. Or goes through A, adding arc BA and AD. So, unless CD is zero or something, which it isn't. 

Wait, but what if arc BD is the arc that passes through C, and arc BC is 30°, and arc CD is... let's say arc CD is x. Then arc BD = 30 + x. But we don't know x. However, if we can express x in terms of other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find arc BD using the fact that in the circle, the sum of certain arcs equals others. For example, arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°, and we know arc BC and arc DA. But we still have two variables.

Wait, but maybe the arcs BC and AD are parts of the circle that can help us find arc BD. For example, if we consider that arc BD is arc BC + arc CD = 30 + arc CD, and arc CD is part of the total arc AB + arc CD = 310°. But without knowing arc AB, we can't proceed. 

At this point, I'm realizing that perhaps there's missing information or a misinterpretation. Let me revisit the initial problem statement to ensure I didn't miss anything.

The problem says: "Find m∠2 if m arc BC = 30 and m arc AD = 20." So, the given arcs are BC and AD. The question is about angle 2, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. 

Wait, perhaps arc BD is the sum of arc BC and arc AD? Let me visualize: if arc BC is 30°, and arc AD is 20°, then if arc BD is the arc that goes from B to D passing through C and A? No, that would be the whole circle. Or maybe it's arc BC + arc AD = 50°, making angle 2 = 25°, which is option B. But why would arc BD be arc BC + arc AD? 

That would only be true if arc BD is the sum of arc BC and arc AD, implying that the arc from B to D passes through C and A, but that would be the entire circle minus arc CD and arc AB. Wait, no. If you go from B to D through C, it's arc BC + arc CD. Through A, it's arc BA + arc AD. So, if I add arc BC (30°) and arc AD (20°), that would be 50°, which might be the arc BD through C if arc CD is 0, which it's not. So this seems incorrect.

But if angle 2 is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, and if arc BD is 50°, then angle 2 would be 25°, which is option B. Maybe that's the intended answer, even though my reasoning is unclear. But why would arc BD be 50°? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a property I'm forgetting. For example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle formed by two chords is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, but that applies to angles formed by two intersecting chords. For example, if two chords intersect inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, it's half the sum of the intercepted arcs if it's formed by two intersecting chords. But angle 2 is an inscribed angle, so it should be half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

Wait, perhaps the arc BD is the arc that is opposite to the angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that arc BD is the sum of arc BC and arc AD, then 30+20=50°, leading to angle 2 being 25°, which is option B. This seems plausible, and since the options include B as 25, perhaps that's the intended answer. 

But why would arc BD be arc BC + arc AD? Let me think again. If the points are arranged as A-B-C-D-A on the circle, then the arc from B to D through C is arc BC + arc CD, and through A is arc BA + arc AD. If I add arc BC (30) and arc AD (20), that would be 50°, which would be the sum of two non-consecutive arcs. But unless there's a reason to believe that arc CD is equal to arc AB, which we don't know. 

Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry or other constraints. Since the problem gives only two arcs, maybe the rest are determined by the given information. But without more data, it's impossible to know. 

Given that the answer choices are A. 20, B. 25, C. 30, D. 155, and if we assume that arc BD is 50°, then angle 2 is 25°, which is option B. This might be the expected answer, despite my confusion in deriving it. Perhaps the intended logic is that arc BD is the sum of arc BC and arc AD, hence 30 + 20 = 50°, and angle 2 is half of that, giving 25°. 

Therefore, the answer would be B. 25.
