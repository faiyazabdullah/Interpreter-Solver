Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle QRS with points R, Q, S. There are other points U, V, T, W. Lines connecting them, and there's a circle tangent to some lines at points U, V, T. Also, some lengths are given. The question is to find x where Line(Q,T) has length 2x, and Line(T,S) is 17. And they also mention that Line(Q,S) equals the sum of Line(Q,T) and Line(T,S). 

First, I need to visualize the setup. Let me note down the given lengths. The lengths of QR is 14, RS is 27, QS is 17. Wait, but QS is given as 17? But QR is 14 and RS is 27. Hmm, so triangle QRS has sides QR=14, RS=27, and QS=17. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of two sides should be greater than the third. Let me check: 14 + 17 = 31, which is greater than 27. 14 + 27 = 41 > 17, and 17 + 27 = 44 >14. So that works. Okay.

Now, there's a circle W tangent to lines QR, RS, and QS at points U, V, T respectively. So, the circle is tangent to each side of triangle QRS. That means the circle is an incircle or maybe an excircle? Wait, but an incircle touches all three sides, but here it's tangent to QR, RS, and QS. Wait, but in a triangle, the incircle touches all three sides. However, the problem mentions tangents at points U, V, T. So maybe the circle is the incircle? Or perhaps an ex-circle?

But wait, the incircle touches each side once. So if the circle is tangent to QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T, then it's the incircle. But then, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency have certain relations. For example, in a triangle, if the incircle touches QR at U, then the lengths from Q to U would be equal to (QR + QS - RS)/2? Wait, let me recall the formula.

In a triangle, the lengths from each vertex to the point of tangency with the incircle are given by (perimeter/2 - opposite side). So, for example, the length from Q to the point of tangency on QR would be (QR + QS - RS)/2. Similarly for others. Wait, let me confirm.

Let me denote the triangle QRS. Let’s say the incircle touches QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T. Then, the lengths QU = (QR + QS - RS)/2. Similarly, RU = (QR + RS - QS)/2, and so on. Let me compute those.

Given QR = 14, RS = 27, QS = 17. So perimeter is 14 + 27 + 17 = 58. Semi-perimeter (s) is 58 / 2 = 29. Then, the length from Q to the point of tangency on QR would be s - RS. Because the formula is s - opposite side. So for QU, since the opposite side to Q is RS, so QU = s - RS = 29 - 27 = 2. Wait, but then the length QU would be 2. But the problem says that Line(Q,T) is 2x, and Line(T,S) is 17. Wait, but T is the point where the incircle touches QS. So QT would be s - RS. Wait, same as above. Let me think again.

Wait, in general, for a triangle ABC, with incircle touching BC at D, AC at E, AB at F. Then AF = AE = (AB + AC - BC)/2. Similarly, BD = BF = (AB + BC - AC)/2, and CD = CE = (BC + AC - AB)/2. So applying this to our triangle QRS.

So for the incircle touching QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T. Then:

QU = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 -27)/2 = 14/2 = 7. Wait, that gives QU = 7. But according to the problem, there's a line QT which is 2x, and TS is 17. Wait, but QT would be the segment from Q to T, where T is the touch point on QS. So QT should be equal to (QS + QR - RS)/2? Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait, the touch point on QS is T. So the length from Q to T would be (QR + QS - RS)/2. Wait, yes, because in the standard formula, the distance from vertex Q to the touch point on side QS would be (QA + QB - BC)/2, but I need to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps more straightforwardly: In triangle QRS, the incircle touches QS at T. Then, the length QT is equal to (QR + QS - RS)/2. Let me verify this.

Yes, because in the standard formula, for the incircle, the distance from Q to the touch point on QS is (perimeter/2 - RS). Since perimeter is QR + RS + QS = 14 + 27 + 17 = 58. So semi-perimeter is 29. Therefore, QT = s - RS = 29 - 27 = 2? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the sides.

Wait, the standard formula is that for the incircle, the distance from vertex Q to the touch point on side QS is (AQ + QS - RS)/2? No, perhaps better to use the formula that the distance from Q to the touch point on QS is equal to (QX + QS - RS)/2? Wait, I need to get back to basics.

Let me consider the incircle. The incircle touches side QR at U, side RS at V, and side QS at T. Then, the lengths from the vertices to the touch points are:

For vertex Q: the distances to the touch points on QR and QS should be equal. Let me call that length as x. Similarly, from vertex R, the distances to touch points on QR and RS are equal, let's say y. From vertex S, the distances to touch points on RS and QS are equal, let's say z.

Then, we have:

x + y = QR = 14,

y + z = RS = 27,

x + z = QS = 17.

Adding these equations: 2(x + y + z) = 14 + 27 + 17 = 58 → x + y + z = 29.

Therefore, solving:

From x + y =14 and x + z =17, subtract first equation from second: z - y = 3 → z = y + 3.

Also, y + z =27 → substituting z: y + y +3 = 27 → 2y =24 → y=12. Then z=15.

Then x = 14 - y = 14 -12 = 2. Wait, so x is 2. But x here represents the distance from Q to the touch point on QR (which is U) and also from Q to the touch point on QS (which is T). So QT is x = 2? But according to the problem statement, Line(Q,T) is 2x. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), 2x). So if QT is 2, then 2x = 2 → x =1? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify variables again. The touch point on QS is T. So QT is part of QS. So QT would be equal to x, which we found as 2. But according to the problem, the length of Line(Q,T) is 2x. So 2x = QT = 2 → x=1. But then the answer choices don't have 1. So something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption that the circle is the incircle is incorrect?

Wait, but the problem states that the circle is tangent to lines QR, RS, and QS. Which would imply that it's the incircle. Unless it's an ex-circle. But ex-circles are tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two. But in this case, the problem says the circle is tangent to the lines QR, RS, and QS. Which are the actual sides of the triangle. So it must be the incircle.

But according to the calculation, QT would be 2, but the problem says that QT is 2x. So 2x = 2 → x=1. But none of the options is 1. So either my reasoning is wrong, or there's another interpretation.

Wait, let me check again. Let me recalculate the values. Given QR=14, RS=27, QS=17. Then the semi-perimeter is (14+27+17)/2 = 58/2=29. Then the length from Q to touch point on QS (which is T) is s - RS = 29 -27=2. So QT=2. Hence, according to the problem, Line(Q,T)=2x implies that 2x=2 → x=1. But that's not among the answer choices. So this suggests that my assumption about the circle being the incircle is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the circle is not the incircle but another circle tangent to those lines?

Wait, but how can a circle be tangent to all three sides of a triangle? It must be the incircle. Unless the triangle is degenerate or something. But the triangle QRS has sides 14, 17, 27. Wait, earlier I checked that the sum of any two sides exceeds the third. So it's a valid triangle. So why does this contradiction happen?

Wait, maybe the circle isn't tangent to the sides of the triangle but to the lines extending beyond the sides? Wait, the problem says "Tangent(Line(Q,R),Circle(W),U)" which means the circle is tangent to the line QR at point U. Similarly for the other lines. So even if the lines are extended, the circle could be tangent to them. So maybe it's not the incircle, but an ex-circle? Let me think.

An ex-circle is tangent to one side of the triangle and the extensions of the other two. For example, the A-excircle is tangent to side BC and the extensions of AB and AC. But in this case, the circle is tangent to lines QR, RS, and QS. Which are all the sides of the triangle. So unless the circle is the incircle, which is the only circle tangent to all three sides. Therefore, my initial conclusion seems correct. So why does the calculation lead to QT=2, conflicting with the given data?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), 2x)". So Line(Q,T) is 2x. But according to the incircle, it should be 2. So 2x=2 → x=1. But the answer choices are A.5, B.7, C.13, D.14. None of these is 1. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative possibility: Maybe the circle is not the incircle, but another circle tangent to those three lines, but not necessarily inside the triangle. Wait, but if it's tangent to all three lines QR, RS, and QS, which are the sides of the triangle, then it must be the incircle or an ex-circle. Wait, but for three lines forming a triangle, there are four circles tangent to all three lines: the incircle and three ex-circles. Each ex-circle is tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two.

But the problem states that the circle is tangent to lines QR, RS, and QS. So depending on whether the circle is inside or outside the triangle, it could be the incircle or an ex-circle. However, the points U, V, T are named such that they are on the lines QR, RS, QS. So for example, if the circle were an ex-circle, then the points of tangency could lie outside the segments QR, RS, QS. But the problem doesn't specify whether U, V, T are on the segments or on the lines. However, the predicated Line(Q,R), Line(R,S), Line(Q,S) suggest that the circle is tangent to the lines, not necessarily the segments. So maybe it's an ex-circle.

Wait, but how do we know which ex-circle? Let's think. Suppose the circle is tangent to QR, RS, and QS. But if it's an ex-circle, then it would be tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two. For example, the ex-circle opposite to Q would be tangent to RS and the extensions of QR and QS. But in this case, the circle is supposed to be tangent to all three lines QR, RS, and QS. So that would require it to be the incircle. Unless... Wait, perhaps the circle is tangent to the lines QR, RS, QS, but not lying inside the triangle. For example, if the triangle is obtuse, the incircle lies inside, but there could be another circle tangent to the three lines but outside the triangle. Wait, but three lines forming a triangle define three circles: the incircle and three ex-circles. Each ex-circle is tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two. So for instance, the ex-circle opposite to R would be tangent to QS and the extensions of QR and RS.

But the problem states that the circle is tangent to lines QR, RS, and QS. So that would mean that it is tangent to all three lines, which would require it to be the incircle or an ex-circle. However, for an ex-circle, it's tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two. So if the circle is tangent to QR, RS, and QS, then it's the incircle. Otherwise, if it's tangent to the extensions, it wouldn't be tangent to all three original lines. Wait, no. If the ex-circle is tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two, then it's still tangent to all three lines (since the lines are infinite). So in that case, the circle is tangent to all three lines, but located outside the triangle. So there are four circles tangent to all three lines: incircle and three ex-circles. So perhaps the circle mentioned here is an ex-circle.

So let's explore this possibility. Let's suppose the circle is an ex-circle. Which ex-circle? Let's see. For example, the ex-circle opposite to Q would be tangent to RS and the extensions of QR and QS. But that would mean it's tangent to line QR (but on the extension beyond R?), line RS, and line QS (extension beyond S?). But the problem states that the circle is tangent to QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T. So the points U, V, T are on the lines QR, RS, QS. Depending on which ex-circle, the points of tangency may be on different parts of the lines.

Alternatively, maybe the circle is the A-excircle, but I need to check which ex-circle would satisfy being tangent to QR, RS, QS.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is the mixtilinear incircle? No, mixitilinear incircles are tangent to two sides and the circumcircle, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is tangent to QR, RS, QS but not lying inside the triangle. For example, imagine the circle outside the triangle, tangent to QR, RS, QS. Wait, but that would require the triangle to be oriented such that such a circle exists. However, regardless of that, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency would follow certain rules.

Let me think again. Let's assume that the circle is tangent to QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T. The lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency depend on which type of circle it is.

For the incircle, as before, we had QT = 2. But that leads us to inconsistency with the given problem. So maybe it's an ex-circle.

Let me try calculating for an ex-circle. Let's suppose the circle is the ex-circle opposite to Q. The ex-circle opposite to Q is tangent to side RS and the extensions of QR and QS. The ex-radius formula is r_a = Δ/(s - a), where a is the side opposite to Q. Wait, but I need to calculate the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency.

For an ex-circle opposite to Q, the points of tangency on the extensions of QR and QS would be at certain distances. Let me recall the formula for the lengths. For ex-circle opposite to Q, the lengths from Q to the touch points on the extensions of QR and QS would be equal to s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Wait, no. Let me recall.

For an ex-circle opposite to Q, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (a + b + c)/2, but actually, the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (-a + b + c)/2. Wait, no, the formula for ex-radius is r_a = Δ / (s - a), where a is the side opposite to Q. Wait, in triangle QRS, if we're considering the ex-circle opposite to Q, then the ex-semiperimeter would be s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? Wait, no. Actually, the ex-radius opposite to Q is given by r_a = Δ / (s - QR), where s is the semi-perimeter. Wait, I need to double-check.

Actually, the ex-radius opposite to vertex Q is given by r_Q = Δ / (s - QR), where s is the semi-perimeter. But I need to find the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency. For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on side RS is at a distance of s from Q? No, let me look for the formula.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are:

On the side RS: the touch point divides RS into segments of length (s) and ... Wait, I think the formula is:

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on RS is at distance (s) from R and S? Not sure. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, for the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on the extension of QR is at distance s from R, and similarly for the extension of QS. Wait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should derive it.

Let me denote the ex-circle opposite to Q. This ex-circle is tangent to side RS and the extensions of QR and QS. Let me denote the touch points on the extensions of QR and QS as U and T, respectively, and on RS as V. Then, the lengths from R to V is equal to the length from R to the touch point on RS, which for ex-circle opposite to Q would be s', where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. Wait, the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no, the ex-semiperimeter is defined as s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is actually s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? Wait, I'm confusing. Let me refer to standard formulas.

The ex-radius opposite to Q is given by r_q = Δ / (s - q), where q is the side opposite to Q. Wait, in standard terms, for triangle ABC, the ex-radius opposite to A is r_a = Δ / (s - a). Here, in our case, the triangle is QRS. Let me assign labels properly. Let me call the triangle QRS, with sides QR = a = 14, RS = b = 27, QS = c = 17. Then the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (14 + 27 + 17)/2 = 58/2 = 29. The ex-radius opposite to Q is r_q = Δ / (s - a), where a is the side opposite to Q. Wait, side opposite to Q is RS, which is length 27. So s - a = 29 - 27 = 2. So r_q = Δ / 2. But I don't know the area Δ yet.

But maybe instead of focusing on the radius, I need to find the lengths from the vertices to the touch points. For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on side RS is at distance (s) from R? Or something like that. Let me think.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on RS would divide RS into segments. The length from R to the touch point on RS would be equal to (s'), where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. Wait, the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no. The ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is actually s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the same as the regular semi-perimeter. I think I need to revisit the formula.

Actually, for ex-circle opposite to Q, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's not correct. The ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? Wait, no. For ex-circle opposite to Q, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's just the regular semi-perimeter. I think I need to look at the formula for the lengths.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on RS is at a distance of s' from R, where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. Wait, no. Let me recall that for the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on side RS is at a distance of s from R and s from S? No. Let me think of the standard formula for ex-tangents.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the length from R to the touch point on RS is equal to s'. Where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. Wait, the ex-semiperimeter for ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to derive it.

Assume that the ex-circle opposite to Q touches RS at V, the extension of QR at U, and the extension of QS at T. Then, the lengths from R to V and from S to V are determined by the ex-semiperimeter. Let me denote the ex-semiperimeter as s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no. The ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter is actually s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, I think the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the same as the regular semi-perimeter. I think I need to use the formula for the ex-tangent lengths.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the lengths from R to the touch point on RS is equal to s' - QS, where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to derive it.

Let me denote the ex-circle opposite to Q. This circle is tangent to side RS and the extensions of QR and QS. Let me denote the touch points on the extension of QR as U, on the extension of QS as T, and on RS as V. Then, the lengths from Q to U and Q to T should be equal, let's say x. The length from R to V would be equal to the length from R to the touch point on RS, which would be (RU + RV)? No, wait.

Let me use the fact that for the ex-circle, the lengths from the vertices to the touch points are:

- From R to V: (s') - QS

- From S to V: (s') - QR

Where s' is the ex-semiperimeter. But what is s'? For ex-circle opposite to Q, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no. For ex-circle opposite to Q, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, I think the ex-semiperimeter for ex-circle opposite to Q is s' = (QR + QS + RS)/2? No, that's not right. Let me check with standard definitions.

In standard terms, for a triangle ABC, the ex-semiperimeter opposite to A is s' = (b + c + a)/2? No, it's s' = (a + b + c)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no. The ex-semiperimeter opposite to A is actually s' = (−a + b + c)/2. Wait, no. Let me check.

Actually, the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to A is s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. Wait, no. For ex-circle opposite to A, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter is defined as s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, the ex-semiperimeter is actually s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. I think I'm missing the correct definition.

Let me search my memory. For ex-circle opposite to A, the ex-semiperimeter is s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, that's the regular semi-perimeter. The ex-semiperimeter is actually s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, I think the ex-semiperimeter for the ex-circle opposite to A is s' = (AB + AC + BC)/2? No, that's not helpful. Let me try to think differently.

For the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on RS is at a distance from R equal to (QR + QS + RS)/2 - QS. Wait, no. Let me think of the ex-circle opposite to Q. The ex-circle touches RS and the extensions of QR and QS. Let me denote the lengths from R to V as x, and from S to V as y. Then, since the ex-circle is tangent to RS, x + y = RS = 27. Additionally, the ex-circle is tangent to the extension of QR, so the length from Q to U (on the extension of QR) is equal to the length from Q to T (on the extension of QS). Let's call this length m. Then, for the extension of QR beyond R, the length from R to U is x = m + QR? No, wait. If the ex-circle touches the extension of QR beyond R, then the length from Q to U is equal to the length from Q to T, which would be m. And the length from R to U would be m - QR? No, let me think carefully.

Let me draw a diagram mentally. The ex-circle opposite to Q is outside the triangle, tangent to RS and the extensions of QR and QS. Let's say the extension of QR beyond R is towards the ex-circle. The touch point on this extension is U. Similarly, the extension of QS beyond S is touched at T. The touch point on RS is V. Now, the length from R to U is equal to the length from R to V. Similarly, the length from S to T is equal to the length from S to V. And the length from Q to U equals the length from Q to T.

Let me denote:

Let RU = RV = x.

And ST = SV = y.

Since RS = 27, then RV + SV = x + y = 27.

Also, the length from Q to U is equal to the length from Q to T. Let's denote this as m.

But the length from Q to U is equal to the length from Q to T, and also, the length from Q to U is equal to the length from Q to T = m.

But the length from Q to U is along the extension of QR beyond R. So the total length from Q to U is QR + RU = 14 + x. Similarly, the length from Q to T is QS + ST = 17 + y. Since these are equal, we have:

14 + x = 17 + y → x - y = 3.

We also have x + y = 27.

Solving these two equations:

x - y = 3

x + y = 27

Adding them: 2x = 30 → x = 15, then y = 12.

Thus, x = 15, y = 12. So the touch point V on RS is 15 units from R and 12 units from S.

But how does this relate to the problem? The problem mentions that the circle is tangent to QR at U, RS at V, and QS at T. So in this scenario, the touch point on QR is U, which is on the extension of QR beyond R. The touch point on QS is T, which is on the extension of QS beyond S. But the problem states that the circle is tangent to Line(QR), Line(RS), and Line(QS), which are the lines containing the sides. So this fits.

Now, the problem mentions Line(Q,T) which is the segment from Q to T. But T is on the extension of QS beyond S, so QT is longer than QS. Specifically, QT = QS + ST = 17 + y = 17 + 12 = 29. According to the problem, LengthOf(Line(Q,T)) = 2x. So 2x = 29 → x = 14.5. But none of the answer choices is 14.5. The options are A.5, B.7, C.13, D.14. Closest is D.14, but not quite. So this suggests that my assumption about the ex-circle opposite to Q is also leading to a non-matching result.

Wait, but the problem says that Line(Q,T) is 2x. If QT is 29, then 2x = 29 → x =14.5, which is not an option. So this also doesn't fit. What's going on here?

Wait, let's go back to the original problem. The problem says that the circle is tangent to Line(Q,R), Line(R,S), Line(Q,S) at U, V, T respectively. So the points U, V, T are the touch points on those lines. But in the case of the incircle, the touch points are on the segments QR, RS, QS. In the case of the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch points are on the extensions of QR and QS, and on RS. But in the problem, the touch points are labeled as U on QR, V on RS, T on QS. So if the touch point on QS is T, then it could be on the segment QS (incircle) or on its extension (ex-circle).

Wait, but in the case of the ex-circle opposite to Q, the touch point on QS would be on the extension beyond S, making T not on segment QS but on its extension. But the problem didn't specify whether T is on the segment or on the line. However, in the given predicates, there is a Point(T), and Line(Q,S). So T is a point on Line(Q,S), which could be anywhere along the line. So it's possible that T is on the extension of QS beyond S, making QT = QS + ST.

But if that's the case, then in the ex-circle scenario, QT = QS + ST = 17 + y = 17 + 12 = 29, as before. But then 2x = 29 → x =14.5, which is not in the options. So this still doesn't work.

Wait, but the problem also includes the equality: Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,S)))). So Line(Q,S) is 17, and it's equal to Line(Q,T) + Line(T,S). So if T is on the line QS, then Line(Q,T) + Line(T,S) = QS. So that would imply that T is between Q and S, making Line(Q,T) + Line(T,S) = QS. But if T is between Q and S, then it's the incircle scenario, where T is on QS. But in that case, we had QT = 2, so Line(Q,T) = 2, Line(T,S) = 17 - 2 = 15. But the problem says Line(Q,S) = Add(Line(Q,T), Line(T,S)) → 17 = 2 + 15 = 17, which checks out. But then Line(Q,T) is 2, so 2x = 2 → x=1, which is not an option.

This suggests that there's a fundamental misunderstanding. Let me check again the given predicates:

The problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,S))))"

Which means QS = QT + TS. This implies that T lies on QS such that QT + TS = QS. Which means T is between Q and S. Thus, T is on segment QS, so the circle is tangent to QS at T, which is on the segment QS. This implies that the circle is the incircle, since the incircle touches all three sides of the triangle, including QS at T.

But earlier calculation gave QT = 2, leading to 2x = 2 → x=1. But this is not an option. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the length QT for the incircle. Let me recalculate that.

In the incircle, the touch point on QS is T. The formula for the length from Q to T is (QR + QS - RS)/2. Let me plug in the numbers:

QR = 14, QS = 17, RS = 27.

So QT = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 - 27)/2 = 14/2 = 7. Ah! Earlier I thought it was 2, but that was due to a miscalculation. Let me redo the earlier steps.

Earlier, I set up the equations for the incircle:

Let x = length from Q to touch point on QR (U), y = length from R to touch point on QR (so that x + y = QR =14), z = length from S to touch point on RS (so that y + z = RS =27), and w = length from S to touch point on QS (so that z + w = QS =17). Wait, no, this might be confusing. Let me use the standard formula.

In the standard incircle, for each side, the touch point divides the side into segments equal to (semi-perimeter - opposite side). So for side QS, the touch point T divides it into segments QT and TS, where QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 and TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2.

Let me calculate QT:

QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 - 27)/2 = 14/2 = 7.

TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2 = (27 + 17 - 14)/2 = 30/2 = 15.

Indeed, QT + TS = 7 + 15 = 22? Wait, but QS is 17. Wait, this can't be. Wait, this indicates a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the segments created by the touch point on side QS is:

QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 ?

Wait, let me verify with the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s = (14 + 27 + 17)/2 = 58/2 = 29.

For the incircle, the length from Q to the touch point on QS is s - RS = 29 - 27 = 2. Wait, this conflicts with the previous calculation. So which is correct?

Ah, here's the confusion. The formula for the touch point on side QS is s - RS. Because in general, for side opposite to Q, which is RS, the touch point on QS would be s - RS. Wait, no. Let me recall: for any triangle, the length from vertex Q to the touch point on side QS is equal to (perimeter/2 - RS). Yes, because the touch point divides QS into segments QT and TS, where QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2, and TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2. Let me compute:

QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 - 27)/2 = 14/2 = 7.

TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2 = (27 + 17 - 14)/2 = 30/2 = 15.

But then QT + TS = 7 + 15 = 22, but QS is 17. This is impossible. So there must be a mistake in the formula.

Wait, this indicates a critical error in understanding. How can QT + TS be larger than QS?

This suggests that my formula is incorrect. Let me rethink.

The correct formula for the lengths from the vertices to the touch points on the sides is:

For the incircle, the touch point on side QS divides it into segments QT and TS, where QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 and TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2. But this must add up to QS. Let's check:

QT + TS = [(QR + QS - RS)/2] + [(RS + QS - QR)/2] = [QR + QS - RS + RS + QS - QR]/2 = (2QS)/2 = QS. So it should work. But in our case, with QS=17, it gives 7 + 15 = 22 ≠ 17. So why is this happening?

Because in our case, the values of QR, RS, and QS are such that this formula yields QT + TS > QS, which is impossible. This suggests that there's a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

Given QR = 14, RS = 27, QS = 17.

Compute QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 - 27)/2 = 14/2 = 7.

TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2 = (27 + 17 - 14)/2 = (30)/2 = 15.

Sum: 7 + 15 = 22, but QS is 17. This is a contradiction. What's wrong here?

Wait, this suggests that the formula is incorrect. But why? Let me check with a simpler example. Take a triangle with sides a=3, b=4, c=5. Semi-perimeter s=6. Touch point on side c (opposite to A) would be s - a = 6 - 3 = 3. Wait, but the touch point on side c (which is length 5) would be divided into segments of length s - a = 3 and s - b = 6 - 4 = 2. Summing 3 + 2 = 5, which matches. So in this case, the formula works.

But in our problem, the values give a contradiction. Why?

Wait, let's check the given lengths again. Are they consistent? QR=14, RS=27, QS=17. Is this possible? Let me check if these lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. As before, 14 + 17 = 31 > 27, 14 + 27 = 41 > 17, and 17 + 27 = 44 > 14. So it is a valid triangle.

So why does the formula give QT + TS = 22 when QS=17? This suggests that the formula is not applicable here. What's the issue?

Wait, I think I mixed up the sides. Let me clarify: in the standard formula, for the touch point on side a (opposite to A), the length from A to the touch point is s - a. But in our case, the touch point is on side QS, which is side opposite to R. Wait, let me redefine the triangle.

Let me label the triangle properly. Let's call the triangle QRS, with sides:

- QR = 14 (between Q and R)

- RS = 27 (between R and S)

- QS = 17 (between Q and S)

So the side opposite to Q is RS (length 27), the side opposite to R is QS (length 17), and the side opposite to S is QR (length 14).

Therefore, the touch point on side QS (which is opposite to R) should be at a distance of s - R, where R is the side opposite to R. Wait, no. The standard formula is: the touch point on side opposite to A is s - a. So for the touch point on side QS (which is opposite to R), the distance from Q to the touch point would be s - RS. Wait, no. Let me rephrase.

For a triangle ABC, the touch point on side BC is at distance s - AB from B and s - AC from C. So in our case, for triangle QRS, the touch point on QS (side opposite to R) would be at distance s - QR from Q and s - RS from S.

Wait, let me clarify. In triangle QRS, the touch point on side QS (which is between Q and S) would be at distance from Q equal to (QR + QS - RS)/2, and from S equal to (RS + QS - QR)/2. Let me calculate:

QR = 14, QS = 17, RS = 27.

Distance from Q to touch point on QS: (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 17 - 27)/2 = (41 - 27)/2 = 14/2 = 7.

Distance from S to touch point on QS: (RS + QS - QR)/2 = (27 + 17 - 14)/2 = 30/2 = 15.

Total: 7 + 15 = 22, but QS is 17. This is impossible. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the formula, or in the given lengths?

Wait, this can't be. There must be a miscalculation. Let me check again:

QR = 14, RS = 27, QS = 17.

s = (14 + 27 + 17)/2 = 58/2 = 29.

Touch point on QS: from Q, it should be s - RS = 29 - 27 = 2. From S, it should be s - QR = 29 - 14 = 15. So QT = 2, TS = 15. Then QT + TS = 2 + 15 = 17, which matches QS = 17. Oh! I see! My earlier calculation was wrong. I incorrectly used (QR + QS - RS)/2 for QT, but the correct formula is s - RS = 29 - 27 = 2. So QT = 2, TS = s - QR = 29 - 14 = 15. Thus, QT + TS = 2 + 15 = 17, which matches QS. So my earlier mistake was using the wrong formula.

So, in this case, QT = 2. But the problem states that Line(Q,T) is 2x. So 2x = 2 → x = 1. But this is not among the answer choices. This suggests that there's a problem with the given data, or I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem also says that Line(Q,T) = 2x, and Line(T,S) = 17. Wait, but in this scenario, Line(T,S) is 15, not 17. But the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(T,S)), 17). Wait, this is conflicting. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), Add(LengthOf(Line(Q,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,S))))"

So QS = QT + TS. And also:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), 17)"
