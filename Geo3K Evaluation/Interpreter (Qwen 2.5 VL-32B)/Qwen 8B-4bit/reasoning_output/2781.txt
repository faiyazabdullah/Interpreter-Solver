MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we're told that ABCD is a rhombus, and the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1, which I assume is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD at point E. 

First, I recall that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but the problem also mentions some specific angle bisectors. Let me check the given predicates again. There are statements about the diagonals AC and BD bisecting certain angles. For example, it says that diagonal BD bisects angle ABC and angle ADC, and diagonal AC bisects angles BCD and DAB. Also, there are right angles at points E for angles AEB, BEC, CED, and DEA. That suggests that the diagonals intersect at E and form four right angles, so they are perpendicular bisectors of each other. 

Wait, but if the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, then they split each other into two equal parts and form right angles where they cross. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not just perpendicular but also bisect the vertex angles. So, angle ABC is 70 degrees. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, then the diagonal BD would split angle ABC into two equal parts. Therefore, each part would be half of 70, which is 35 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions that there are right angles at E for angles like AEB, BEC, etc. Hmm, maybe angle 1 refers to one of those right angles? No, because the options don't include 90. Wait, the answer choices are 45, 55, 70, 125. So maybe angle 1 isn't the right angle itself but another angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals and the sides?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 refers to one of the angles created by the diagonals. Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals divide it into four right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are halves of the diagonals. Also, the angles formed at the center (point E) are right angles. However, the problem states that angles AEB, BEC, CED, and DEA are right angles. So, the diagonals intersect at E perpendicularly. Now, considering the angles around point E. 

But how does angle ABC being 70 degrees affect this? Let's consider triangle ABC. Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB equals BC equals CD equals DA. The diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle ABC is 70 degrees, so the diagonal BD splits it into two angles of 35 degrees each. Similarly, the diagonal AC would split angle BAD into two equal parts. 

Now, since the diagonals intersect at E, forming four right angles. Let's focus on triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angle at E is 90 degrees, angle at B is 35 degrees (since BD bisects angle ABC). Therefore, the third angle at A would be 180 - 90 - 35 = 55 degrees. Wait, but angle at A in triangle ABE is part of angle BAD. But angle BAD is adjacent to angle ABC. In a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. Since angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle BAD is 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Then, the diagonal AC bisects angle BAD, splitting it into two angles of 55 degrees each. So that matches with the earlier calculation. 

So, in triangle ABE, angle at A is 55 degrees. But angle 1 could refer to angle AEB, which is 90 degrees, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is referring to angle AEB, but since that's 90, which isn't listed. Wait, the answer choices are 45, 55, 70, 125. So 55 is an option. Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there are right angles at E for angles AEB, BEC, etc., but also there are angle bisectors. Let me think again. The problem says that angle AEB is a right angle, which we know. But the question asks for m∠1. Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles created by the intersection of the diagonals and the sides. Let me visualize the rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at E. 

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, AE is half of AC, BE is half of BD. The diagonals split the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. Each triangle has legs of length AE and BE, and hypotenuse AB. 

In triangle ABE, angle at E is 90°, angle at B is half of angle ABC, which is 35°, so angle at A is 55°. But angle at A here is angle BAE, which is half of angle BAD. Since angle BAD is 110°, as mentioned before. 

But maybe angle 1 is referring to angle AEB, which is 90°, but that's not among the choices. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 refers to angle ABD? Wait, angle ABD is half of angle ABC, so 35°, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, perhaps angle 1 refers to one of the angles formed by the diagonals inside the rhombus. For instance, the angles between the diagonals and the sides. Let me think again. 

Since the diagonals intersect at E, creating vertical angles. Let's take angle AEB, which is 90°, but that's already covered. What about the angles between the diagonals and the sides? For example, angle between diagonal BD and side AB. Which is 35°, as BD bisects angle ABC. Or angle between diagonal AC and side AB, which would be half of angle BAD, which is 55°, as discussed earlier. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is referring to the angle between the diagonals and a side? Like, in triangle ABE, angle at B is 35°, which is half of angle ABC. But that's 35°, not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is referring to angle BEC, which is a right angle. Again, same issue. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to angle 1 as one of the angles formed by the diagonals. For example, in the rhombus, the diagonals split the angles into smaller ones. Let me try to calculate the measures of the angles at point E. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 refers to one of the angles of the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, in triangle ABE, angles are 90°, 35°, and 55°, as before. If angle 1 is the angle at E, which is 90°, but that's not an option. If it's the angle at A, which is 55°, then that would be option B. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 55. So maybe angle 1 is referring to angle BAE, which is 55°, as calculated. 

Let me confirm this. In the rhombus ABCD, angle ABC is 70°, so diagonal BD bisects it into two angles of 35°. Diagonal AC bisects angle BAD into two angles of 55°, since angle BAD is 110° (as consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary). Therefore, in triangle ABE, which is a right triangle, the angles are 35°, 55°, and 90°. Thus, angle at A (BAE) is 55°, which would be angle 1. Hence, the answer should be 55, which is option B.
