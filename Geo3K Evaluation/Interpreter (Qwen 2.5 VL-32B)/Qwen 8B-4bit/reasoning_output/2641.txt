MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle ABC, which is denoted as ∠ABC. The given information includes several angle measures and some relationships between them. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates and see how they connect.

First, there's a triangle ABC, so points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there's a point D connected by a line from C to D. Also, there are several angles mentioned: ∠BDC (which is ∠BCD?), wait, the predicates say Angle(B, C, D) which would be ∠BCD? Wait, no. In angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(B, C, D) is the angle at point C between points B and D. Similarly, other angles are given.

So, the given angles are:
- Measure of ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) is 148 degrees.
- Measure of ∠CAB (Angle(C,A,B)) is 2x - 15.
Wait, no. Wait, the Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, because the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C,A,B) is ∠CAB, which is at vertex A. Similarly, Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at vertex A between points B and C. Wait, but that seems like it's the same as ∠BAC. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me parse each angle:

Angle(A, B, C): This is the angle at point B between points A and C. So ∠ABC.

Angle(B, C, D): Angle at point C between points B and D. So ∠BCD.

Angle(C, A, B): Angle at point A between points C and B. So ∠CAB.

Angle(B, A, C): Angle at point A between points B and C. Which is the same as ∠BAC. Wait, but if the middle letter is A, then yes. So ∠BAC.

But also, there's an ExternalAngle predicate involving these three angles: ExternalAngle(Angle(B, C, D), Angle(C, A, B), Angle(B, A, C)). Hmm, external angle... Wait, the external angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. But here, maybe it's referring to something else?

Wait, the ExternalAngle predicate might mean that one of these angles is an external angle formed by extending a side. For example, if we have triangle ABC, and extend one of its sides to form an external angle. However, the given angles include ∠BCD, which is at point C, connected to point D. Since there's a line from C to D, perhaps D lies on an extension of BC or AB or AC?

Alternatively, since there's a line CD, maybe D is a point such that CD is an extension of CB or CA?

But first, let's focus on the angles given. We know that ∠BCD is 148°, which is an external angle? Or internal? Depending on where D is located.

Also, the other angles given are ∠CAB (which is ∠CAB = 2x - 15) and ∠BAC (which is Angle(B,A,C) = x - 5). Wait, hold on. Are these angles different?

Wait, ∠CAB is the angle at A between C and B. That's the same as ∠BAC. And ∠BAC is another angle at A between B and C. Wait, that's the same angle. Wait, unless there's a typo in the predicates. Let me check again.

Original predicates:

Angle(C, A, B): So the middle point is A, so it's angle at A between C and B. So that's ∠CAB.

Angle(B, A, C): Middle point is A, so it's angle at A between B and C. Which is the same as ∠BAC. Wait, but those are the same angle. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the way the angle is defined depends on the order? Like, maybe ∠BAC is the same as ∠CAB. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup? Because having two different expressions for the same angle could imply that they're equal. But according to the given, they are set to different expressions. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me re-express:

Angle(C, A, B) is the angle at A between points C and B. So that's ∠CAB.

Angle(B, A, C) is the angle at A between points B and C. Which is the same as ∠BAC. But ∠BAC and ∠CAB are the same angle. Therefore, this suggests that ∠CAB equals ∠BAC. But according to the given, their measures are expressed as 2x - 15 and x - 5 respectively. That implies that 2x - 15 = x - 5, leading to x = 10. But that seems conflicting with the rest of the problem. Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me double-check the angle definitions. 

In standard notation, ∠ABC means the angle at point B between points A and C. So, the middle letter is the vertex. Therefore:

- Angle(A, B, C) is ∠ABC (vertex at B).
- Angle(B, C, D) is ∠BCD (vertex at C).
- Angle(C, A, B) is ∠CAB (vertex at A between C and B).
- Angle(B, A, C) is ∠BAC (vertex at A between B and C).

Ah! Wait, ∠CAB and ∠BAC are indeed the same angle. So why are they given as separate expressions? That suggests either a typo in the problem or perhaps a misunderstanding. However, given that the problem includes both, we must consider that perhaps there's a different configuration. Wait, but maybe D is involved in forming an external angle. 

Wait, the ExternalAngle predicate is applied to Angle(B, C, D), Angle(C, A, B), and Angle(B, A, C). So, according to the ExternalAngle property, which I assume refers to the external angle theorem. The external angle theorem says that the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles. 

So, if ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) is an external angle, then it should be equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. What are the remote interior angles in this case? If we consider triangle ABC, and if D is a point such that CD is an extension of BC beyond C, making ∠BCD an external angle. Then, the remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠ABC. Wait, but the given angles are ∠CAB (same as ∠BAC) and ∠BAC (same as ∠CAB)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the external angle is at C, so the two remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠ABC. 

But according to the ExternalAngle predicate, it's saying that the measure of ∠BCD (external angle) equals the sum of the measures of ∠CAB and ∠BAC. Wait, but ∠CAB and ∠BAC are the same angle. That would imply that ∠BCD = 2*(measure of ∠BAC). But according to the given, ∠BCD is 148°, and ∠CAB is 2x -15, while ∠BAC is x -5. Wait, but if they are the same angle, then 2x -15 = x -5 → x=10. But then substituting back, ∠CAB would be 2*10 -15 = 5, and ∠BAC would be 10 -5 =5. So that works. But then, according to the external angle theorem, ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC. Wait, but if ∠BCD is 148°, and ∠BAC is 5°, then ∠ABC would be 148 -5 = 143°, but that doesn't seem to fit with anything else. Also, the problem asks for ∠ABC, which would be 143°, but none of the answer choices are that. So there's a contradiction here. 

Therefore, my initial assumption that ∠CAB and ∠BAC are the same angle may be incorrect. Perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me re-examine the angle notations.

Wait, Angle(C, A, B) is ∠CAB (vertex at A between C and B). Angle(B, A, C) is ∠BAC (vertex at A between B and C). These are the same angle, so they should be equal. However, the problem gives different expressions for them. Therefore, this suggests that either there's a misunderstanding in the angle notation, or perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate isn't referring to the standard external angle theorem. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate refers to a different relationship. Let me look up what ExternalAngle might mean in this context. Since the user hasn't specified, but in standard terms, an external angle is formed by one side of the triangle and the extension of another. So, if we have triangle ABC, and extend side BC to a point D, then ∠BCD is an external angle at point C. In that case, the external angle ∠BCD equals the sum of the two remote interior angles, which are ∠BAC and ∠ABC. 

Given that, the ExternalAngle predicate likely indicates that ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC. 

But according to the problem, ∠BCD is 148°, and the other angles given are ∠CAB (which is ∠BAC) as 2x -15, and ∠BAC (same as ∠CAB) as x -5. Wait, but that would require 2x -15 = x -5 → x=10. But then ∠BAC would be 5°, and ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 5 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 143°, which isn't among the options. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate involves more than just the two angles. Let me check the original problem statement again. It says:

ExternalAngle(Angle(B, C, D), Angle(C, A, B), Angle(B, A, C))

This might indicate that ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) is an external angle, and the other two angles are the remote interior angles. So, ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC. But again, if ∠CAB and ∠BAC are the same angle, then this would lead to ∠BCD = 2∠BAC. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different angles. How could that be? Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the second angle is supposed to be ∠CBA or something else. Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate is indicating that ∠BCD is an external angle formed by extending a different side. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate is indicating that ∠BCD is an external angle, and the other two angles are the ones adjacent to it. For instance, if we have triangle ABC, and point D is on the extension of AB, then ∠BCD would be an external angle. But without knowing where D is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate is part of the problem's own definition, implying that the measure of the external angle is equal to the sum of the other two angles given. Let's proceed under that assumption, even though it leads to inconsistencies.

Wait, but if the ExternalAngle predicate implies that ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC, and given that ∠BCD is 148°, then:

148 = ∠CAB + ∠BAC.

But if ∠CAB and ∠BAC are the same angle, then this equation becomes 148 = 2∠BAC → ∠BAC = 74°. But according to the given, ∠CAB is 2x -15 and ∠BAC is x -5. So setting them equal:

2x -15 = x -5 → x=10. Then, ∠BAC would be 10 -5 =5°, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that ∠BAC is 74°. Hence, this suggests that there's a fundamental misunderstanding.

Perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate is not about the standard external angle theorem, but instead refers to some other relationship. Let me think differently.

Maybe the ExternalAngle(A, B, C) refers to an external angle at point B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate is indicating that ∠BCD is an external angle to triangle ABC, and thus equals the sum of ∠BAC and ∠ABC. Let me try that.

Assuming that ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC. Given that ∠BCD is 148°, then:

148 = ∠BAC + ∠ABC.

Now, the problem gives us expressions for ∠BAC and ∠CAB. Wait, but ∠CAB is the same as ∠BAC. However, the given expressions are:

MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)) = 2x - 15 → which is ∠CAB = 2x -15.

MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, C)) = x -5 → which is ∠BAC = x -5.

Wait, but ∠CAB and ∠BAC are the same angle, so they should be equal. Thus:

2x -15 = x -5 → x = 10.

Substituting back:

∠CAB = 2(10) -15 = 5°, and ∠BAC = 10 -5 =5°. So they are equal, which checks out.

Then, from the external angle theorem, ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 5 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 143°, which is not among the answer choices. This suggests a contradiction, so my assumptions must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate refers to something else. Let's think about the diagram. There's a triangle ABC, with point D connected to C. Line CD is present. So, maybe D is on an extension of BC or AB?

Suppose D is on the extension of BC beyond C. Then, ∠BCD would be an external angle at point C. In that case, the external angle ∠BCD equals the sum of the remote interior angles ∠BAC and ∠ABC. 

As before, that gives 148 = ∠BAC + ∠ABC. 

But we also have expressions for ∠BAC and ∠CAB. Wait, but earlier, we found that ∠BAC = 5°, leading to ∠ABC = 143°, which is not in the options. So maybe there's a different way to interpret the given angles.

Wait, perhaps the given angles aren't both ∠BAC and ∠CAB, but instead ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different angles. How? Let me check again the angle definitions.

Angle(C, A, B): This is the angle at A between C and B → ∠CAB.

Angle(B, A, C): This is the angle at A between B and C → which is the same as ∠BAC. So they are the same angle. Hence, their measures must be equal. Therefore, the equations 2x -15 = x -5 → x=10. 

But if that's the case, then ∠BAC is 5°, and ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 148 -5 =143°, which is not an option. Hence, contradiction. 

Therefore, there must be an alternative interpretation. Perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate is not referring to the external angle theorem, but rather some other relationship. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate refers to the fact that ∠BCD is an external angle formed by extending a side, and the other two angles are the adjacent angles inside the triangle. For example, if we have triangle ABC, and extend side AB to a point D, creating an external angle at B. But then ∠BCD wouldn't directly relate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate is indicating that ∠BCD is an external angle, and the other two angles are the two adjacent angles at point C. Wait, but that doesn't align with the usual external angle theorem.

Another possibility: The ExternalAngle predicate could be indicating that ∠BCD is supplementary to one of the other angles. For example, if ∠BCD is an external angle, it might be supplementary to ∠ACB. But without knowing the position of D, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the ExternalAngle predicate actually refers to a different combination. For example, maybe it's saying that the external angle at C (∠BCD) is equal to the sum of ∠CAB and ∠BAC. But if those are the same angle, then it's 2∠BAC = 148°, so ∠BAC = 74°. But according to the given, ∠CAB is 2x -15 and ∠BAC is x -5. Setting them equal gives x=10, but then ∠BAC is 5°, not 74°. So that's inconsistent. 

Wait, unless the ExternalAngle predicate is indicating that ∠BCD is equal to the sum of ∠CAB and ∠BAC, but those are different angles. How could that be? If ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different angles, which would only happen if the points are arranged differently. For example, if D is not on the extension of BC, but somewhere else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given expressions for the angles are for different angles. Let me list all the angles given:

- ∠BCD = 148° (given)
- ∠CAB = 2x -15°
- ∠BAC = x -5°
- ExternalAngle(Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,A,B), Angle(B,A,C)) → which might mean that ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC

But if that's the case, then:

148 = (2x -15) + (x -5) → 148 = 3x -20 → 3x = 168 → x = 56.

Then, substituting x=56 into ∠CAB and ∠BAC:

∠CAB = 2*56 -15 = 112 -15 = 97°

∠BAC = 56 -5 = 51°

Wait, but these are two different angles. But earlier, I thought they were the same. But if they are different, then maybe there's a mistake in assuming they are the same. How can ∠CAB and ∠BAC be different? Only if the points are not in the same plane or if there's a different configuration. But in a triangle ABC, ∠BAC and ∠CAB are the same angle. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup or in the interpretation of the angle notations. 

However, if we proceed under the assumption that ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different angles, then their sum is 97 +51 = 148, which matches the given ∠BCD. This would mean that the external angle theorem applies here, with ∠BCD being the sum of ∠CAB and ∠BAC. 

But why would ∠CAB and ∠BAC be different? That would require that point D is not on the extension of BC, but perhaps on another side. Let me visualize this. Suppose we have triangle ABC, and point D is such that CD is extended from AC, forming an external angle at C. But then ∠BCD would be an external angle at C. In this case, the remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠ABC. However, the given angles here are ∠CAB and ∠BAC. If ∠CAB is ∠BAC, then this would still not fit. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠CAB is a different angle. For example, if D is on the extension of AB, then ∠CAB might refer to a different angle. Wait, this is getting too vague. Perhaps the key is to accept that ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different due to some mislabeling, and proceed with the calculation. 

If we take the given that ∠CAB = 2x -15 and ∠BAC = x -5, and their sum is 148°, then:

2x -15 + x -5 = 148 → 3x -20 = 148 → 3x = 168 → x = 56.

Thus, x = 56. Now, ∠BAC = x -5 = 51°, and ∠CAB = 2x -15 = 97°. 

But wait, in a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180°. So if ∠BAC is 51°, and ∠ABC is what we're trying to find, and ∠BCA is something else. But we also have ∠BCD = 148°, which is an external angle. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the external angle at C (∠BCD) is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles ∠BAC and ∠ABC. So:

∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 148 -51 = 97°. 

But the question asks for ∠ABC, which would be 97°, but this isn't one of the options. Wait, the answer choices are A.42, B.51, C.56, D.148. So 97 isn't listed. This suggests another inconsistency. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in identifying which angles are the remote interior angles. If the external angle is at C, then the remote interior angles are ∠BAC and ∠ABC. But if ∠CAB is 97°, which is the same as ∠BAC, then ∠ABC would be 148 -97 = 51°, which is option B. 

Wait, let's redo that. If ∠BCD is the external angle at C, then:

∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC.

From above, we found that ∠BAC = x -5 = 56 -5 = 51°, and ∠BCD = 148°. So:

148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 148 -51 = 97°. But that's not an option. However, if ∠CAB is the remote interior angle, and ∠BAC is another angle, then perhaps I mixed up which is which.

Wait, if ∠CAB is the same as ∠BAC, then ∠BAC = 51°, and the remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠ABC. Hence, 148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 97°. Still not matching options.

But if instead, the external angle is at a different vertex. Suppose ∠BCD is an external angle at B, but that would require D to be on an extension of AB. Let's explore this scenario.

If D is on the extension of AB beyond B, then ∠BCD would be an external angle at B. In that case, the remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠BCA. But then ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠BCA. However, we don't know ∠BCA. 

Alternatively, if ∠BCD is an external angle at A, but that would require extending AC or AB. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the external angle is not related to triangle ABC, but to another triangle. For example, if D is part of a larger figure. But without more info, it's hard to say.

But going back, if we assume that the external angle theorem applies, and that ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC, and from our previous calculation, ∠BAC = 51°, then ∠ABC = 97°, which isn't an option. But if instead, we considered that ∠CAB is the remote interior angle, and ∠BAC is another, but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, but if x=56, then ∠BAC = x -5 = 51°, and ∠CAB = 2x -15 = 97°. If these are two different angles, maybe they are parts of the triangle. For example, if there's another triangle involved. 

Wait, the problem mentions Point D, and Line(C, D). So, maybe triangle ABC and point D forms another triangle or creates other angles. For example, if CD is an extension of BC, then ∠BCD is an external angle. But then, if ∠CAB is 97°, and ∠BAC is 51°, then how do these relate?

Alternatively, maybe the given expressions for the angles are for different angles. For example, ∠CAB is an angle at A, and ∠BAC is another angle at A, which would only be possible if there are two different lines from A. But in a triangle, there are only two sides from A: AB and AC. So ∠BAC and ∠CAB are the same angle. 

At this point, I think there must be a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach. Let's forget about the external angle theorem for a moment and focus on the given equations.

We have:

1. Measure of ∠BCD = 148°
2. Measure of ∠CAB = 2x -15
3. Measure of ∠BAC = x -5
4. ExternalAngle(Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,A,B), Angle(B,A,C)) → which we've interpreted as ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC

Assuming that, then:

148 = (2x -15) + (x -5) → 3x -20 = 148 → 3x = 168 → x = 56.

So x = 56.

Now, ∠BAC = x -5 = 51°, and ∠CAB = 2x -15 = 97°. 

Now, in triangle ABC, the sum of the angles is 180°. So:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180°

We know ∠BAC = 51°, but we don't know ∠ABC or ∠BCA. However, if we consider that ∠BCD is an external angle at C, then ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 97°. But again, this isn't an option. 

Wait, but if ∠CAB is 97°, and ∠BAC is 51°, perhaps these are two different angles in the diagram. For example, if there's a triangle ACD or something. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for ∠ABC, which is ∠ABC, and if we consider that ∠ABC is the angle at B, which is not directly given. But in our previous calculation, ∠ABC = 97°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, but let me check the answer choices again: A.42, B.51, C.56, D.148. 

If x=56, then ∠BAC = x -5 = 51°, which is option B. Could it be that the question is asking for ∠BAC instead of ∠ABC? No, the question specifically asks for ∠ABC. 

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting which angle is which. Let me go back to the beginning.

The question asks for m∠ABC, which is the angle at B. 

In triangle ABC, the angles are:

- At A: ∠BAC (or ∠CAB)
- At B: ∠ABC
- At C: ∠BCA

We have ∠BCD = 148°, which is an external angle at C. So, as per external angle theorem:

∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = ∠BAC + ∠ABC.

We also have:

∠BAC = x -5

And from the earlier calculation, x=56, so ∠BAC = 51°. Thus:

148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 97°, which is not an option.

But if instead, the external angle theorem uses ∠CAB instead of ∠BAC, then:

∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠ABC → 148 = (2x -15) + ∠ABC.

But we also have ∠BAC = x -5. If ∠BAC is part of the triangle, then:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180°.

But without knowing ∠BCA, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠CAB is the angle at A, which is ∠BAC, and ∠BAC is another angle, but this brings us back to the same issue.

At this point, I think the most plausible explanation is that there was a mistake in the problem's angle labels, and that the intended expression for ∠BAC is 2x -15, and ∠CAB is x -5. But that would mean they are different angles, which is impossible in a triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ExternalAngle predicate is not referring to the external angle theorem but to some other relationship, like vertical angles or supplementary angles. For example, if ∠BCD is supplementary to ∠BCA, then ∠BCD + ∠BCA = 180°. 

If that's the case, then:

∠BCD + ∠BCA = 180° → 148 + ∠BCA = 180 → ∠BCA = 32°.

Then, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180°:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180 → (x -5) + ∠ABC + 32 = 180 → ∠ABC = 180 - x +5 -32 = 153 -x.

But we also have ∠CAB = 2x -15. If ∠CAB is ∠BAC, then ∠BAC = 2x -15 = x -5 → x = 10, which leads to ∠BAC = 5°, and ∠ABC = 153 -10 = 143°, still not matching.

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption about the ExternalAngle predicate. Maybe it's not about the external angle theorem, but simply stating that ∠BCD is an external angle, and therefore, it is supplementary to one of the other angles. 

For example, if ∠BCD is supplementary to ∠BCA, then:

∠BCD + ∠BCA = 180 → ∠BCA = 32°, as before.

Then, using the triangle angle sum:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180 → (x -5) + ∠ABC + 32 = 180 → ∠ABC = 143 -x.

But we also have ∠CAB = 2x -15. If ∠CAB is ∠BAC, then 2x -15 = x -5 → x=10, leading to ∠ABC = 143 -10 = 133°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if ∠CAB is a different angle, like ∠CAD or something, but without knowing D's position, it's hard to say.

Another possibility: The problem has a typo, and the ExternalAngle predicate is meant to link ∠BCD with ∠CAB and ∠BAC, but there's a mix-up in the angle names. For example, if ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC, and we have:

148 = (2x -15) + (x -5) → 3x = 168 → x=56.

Then, ∠BAC = x -5 = 51°, and ∠CAB = 2x -15 = 97°. If these are two different angles, perhaps ∠ABC can be found via other means.

In triangle ABC, we have:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180°.

But we don't know ∠BCA. However, if ∠BCD is an external angle at C, then ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 97°, which is not an option. But if instead, ∠BCD = ∠BAC + ∠BCA, then:

148 = 51 + ∠BCA → ∠BCA = 97°, and then ∠ABC = 180 - 51 -97 = 32°, which is not an option either.

Wait, but if x=56, then ∠CAB = 97°, which could be ∠BCA. So, ∠BCA = 97°, and ∠BAC = 51°, so ∠ABC = 180 -97 -51 = 32°, which is not an option. 

But if the question asks for ∠ABC, which is 32°, but that's not an option. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that the answer choices include 51, which is x -5 when x=56, and if the question had asked for ∠BAC instead of ∠ABC, then the answer would be B.51. But since the question asks for ∠ABC, and given the options, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's go back to the original equations:

If we assume that ∠BCD = ∠CAB + ∠BAC, and that ∠CAB and ∠BAC are different angles, then:

148 = (2x -15) + (x -5) → x=56.

Then, ∠CAB = 2*56 -15 = 97°, and ∠BAC = 56 -5 = 51°.

Now, in triangle ABC, the angles are ∠BAC = 51°, ∠ABC = ?, and ∠BCA = ?.

If ∠BCD is an external angle at C, then it equals ∠BAC + ∠ABC → 148 = 51 + ∠ABC → ∠ABC = 97°, which is not an option. 

But if instead, ∠BCD is an external angle at B, then it would equal ∠BAC + ∠BCA. 

Let me try that. If ∠BCD is an external angle at B, then it equals ∠BAC + ∠BCA. So:

148 = 51 + ∠BCA → ∠BCA = 97°.

Then, in triangle ABC, the angles are ∠BAC = 51°, ∠BCA = 97°, so ∠ABC = 180 -51 -97 = 32°, which is not an option. 

But if the external angle is at A, then ∠BCD = ∠ABC + ∠BCA. Let's say ∠BCD is an external angle at A, so it equals ∠ABC + ∠BCA. 

Then:

148 = ∠ABC + ∠BCA.

But we also have ∠BAC = 51°, so:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180 → 51 + ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 180 → ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 129°.

But from the external angle, ∠ABC + ∠BCA = 148°, which is a contradiction. 

This suggests that the problem is flawed, but since it's a multiple-choice question, and one of the options is 51, which is x-5 when x=56, and if the question had asked for ∠BAC, then the answer would be B.51. 

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is B.51, assuming that the question mistakenly asked for ∠BAC instead of ∠ABC. Or, there's a miscalculation in the external angle part. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExternalAngle predicate is not about the external angle theorem, but about the fact that ∠BCD is equal to ∠BAC. But that would give 148 = x -5 → x=153, which is not helpful. 

Given the time I've spent and the available options, I'll conclude that the intended answer is B.51, assuming that the question wants ∠BAC instead of ∠ABC, or there's a miscalculation in the problem setup. Hence, I'll choose B.
