====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a hexagon with points A, B, C, D, E, F. Each of these points has an angle associated with them, labeled Angle(A), Angle(B), etc. The problem gives us some equations involving these angles and asks us to find the value of x. 

First, I need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon. Wait, but wait—hexagons can be regular or irregular. In a regular hexagon, each interior angle is 120 degrees, so the total would be 6*120 = 720 degrees. Oh! The last predicate says that the sum of all six angles is 720. That matches what I remember about hexagons. So that checks out. 

So, the problem gives expressions for each angle in terms of x. Let me list them again:

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = Sub(x, 6) → which is x - 6
MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = Add(x, 4) → x + 4
MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = x
MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 56
MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = Add(x, 10) → x + 10
MeasureOf(Angle(F)) is missing? Wait, no—the sixth angle is F, but the sum includes all six. Wait, looking back at the given predicates: the SumOf(MeasureOf(Angles A, B, C, D, E, F)) equals 720. So, there are six angles here. But in the given expressions, only five angles are defined in terms of x: A, B, C, D, E. Wait, where is Angle(F)? It seems like the measure of Angle(F) isn't given directly. Wait, maybe it's part of the equation?

Wait, the problem states that the sum of all six angles is 720. So, we have five angles expressed in terms of x and one more angle, which is Angle(F). However, the problem didn't specify anything about Angle(F). Wait, but perhaps there's something missing here. Let me check again.

Looking at the given predicates:

They mention Hexagon(A,B,C,D,E,F). Then, Point(A) through Point(F). Then, Angles for each point: Angle(A) to Angle(F). But the measures are given for A, B, C, D, E. For example:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), Sub(x, 6))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), Add(x, 4))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), x)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D)), 56)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), Add(x, 10))

Then, the sum of all six angles is 720. So, the sixth angle is Angle(F), whose measure isn't given. Therefore, we need to express the sum of all six angles as:

Sum = (x - 6) + (x + 4) + x + 56 + (x + 10) + Measure(F) = 720.

But wait, how do we find Measure(F)? Is there another equation or constraint? The problem doesn't mention anything else about Angle(F). Maybe there's an assumption that the hexagon is convex or regular? Or perhaps there's another relationship?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user wrote:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), MeasureOf(Angle(B)), MeasureOf(Angle(C)), MeasureOf(Angle(D)), MeasureOf(Angle(E)), MeasureOf(Angle(F))), 720)"

So, that means all six angles are included. But only five of them are given in terms of x except for Angle(F). Wait, unless Angle(F) is also expressed in terms of x. Did I miss that?

No, looking back, the predicates only give expressions for A, B, C, D, E. There's no expression for Angle(F). Hmm. Wait, perhaps there's a typo, or maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Original problem:

Given:

Hexagon(A,B,C,D,E,F)

Point(A) to Point(F)

Angles:

Angle(A) to Angle(F)

Equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = x - 6

MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = x + 4

MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = x

MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 56

MeasureOf(Angle(E)) = x + 10

Sum of all six angles = 720.

Therefore, the sixth angle, Angle(F), is not given. How do we proceed?

Wait, maybe there's an error here. Because if all angles are given in terms of x except for Angle(F), then we can't solve for x unless there's another condition. Unless there's a property of hexagons that the sum of angles is fixed regardless of the type. Which is true. For any simple (non-intersecting) polygon with n sides, the sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180 degrees. For a hexagon, n=6, so sum is (6-2)*180 = 4*180 = 720 degrees. Which matches the given sum. So, that's already accounted for in the problem. Therefore, the sum of all six angles is 720, which is given. So, even though Angle(F) isn't specified, we can write the equation:

Sum = (x - 6) + (x + 4) + x + 56 + (x + 10) + Measure(F) = 720.

But since the total is 720, and the sum of all angles must be 720, we can compute the sum of the first five angles and set up an equation. Wait, but we don't know Measure(F). So unless there's another relation, this seems unsolvable. But the problem must have enough info. Wait, maybe Angle(F) is also expressed in terms of x? Did I misread?

Let me check again the original problem's given predicates. The user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), Sub(x, 6))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), Add(x, 4))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), x)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D)), 56)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), Add(x, 10))

Equals(SumOf(...), 720)"

Ah! Wait, the sixth angle is Angle(F), but there's no equation given for its measure. So unless there's a missing equation, or perhaps Angle(F) is determined via another method. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo, and one of the other angles was supposed to be Angle(F). For instance, maybe the fifth angle was supposed to be Angle(F), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hexagon is regular? But then all angles would be equal. But in that case, each angle would be 720 / 6 = 120 degrees. But the given expressions involve variables, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me think again. Suppose that all six angles are expressed in terms of x, but one of them is a constant. Wait, for example, Angle(D) is 56, which is a constant. The rest are in terms of x. So, the sum is:

(x - 6) + (x + 4) + x + 56 + (x + 10) + Angle(F) = 720.

But we still have two unknowns: x and Angle(F). So unless there's another equation, we can't solve for x. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps Angle(F) is expressed in terms of x in a way that wasn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe Angle(F) is zero or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem gives the measure of each angle as follows:

Angle(A): x - 6

Angle(B): x + 4

Angle(C): x

Angle(D): 56

Angle(E): x + 10

Angle(F): ?

And the sum of all six angles is 720. So, adding them together:

(x -6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + Angle(F) = 720

Combine like terms:

Let's compute the coefficients for x:

Each term contributing x:

Angle(A): x

Angle(B): x

Angle(C): x

Angle(E): x

That's four x terms.

Wait, wait:

Angle(A) is x -6 → coefficient of x is 1

Angle(B) is x +4 → coefficient of x is 1

Angle(C) is x → coefficient of x is 1

Angle(E) is x +10 → coefficient of x is 1

So total x terms: 4x

Constant terms:

From Angle(A): -6

From Angle(B): +4

From Angle(D): +56

From Angle(E): +10

Total constants: (-6 +4) +56 +10 = (-2) + 56 +10 = 64

Plus Angle(F).

So overall equation:

4x + 64 + Angle(F) = 720

Thus, 4x + Angle(F) = 720 - 64 = 656.

But without knowing Angle(F), we can't solve for x. Therefore, there must be another condition. Perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the hexagon is convex and that all angles are positive? Or perhaps Angle(F) is expressed in terms of x in another way?

Wait, but the problem only mentions six angles. Are there any other constraints? Like, maybe the hexagon being cyclic? Or maybe some other property?

Alternatively, maybe I missed an equation. Let me check again the problem's given predicates.

The user wrote:

"Hexagon(A,B,C,D,E,F)

Point(A)

Point(B)

Point(C)

Point(D)

Point(E)

Point(F)

Angle(A)

Angle(B)

Angle(C)

Angle(D)

Angle(E)

Angle(F)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), Sub(x, 6))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), Add(x, 4))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), x)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D)), 56)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), Add(x, 10))

Equals(SumOf(...), 720)"

So, there's no mention of Angle(F)'s measure. Hence, this seems incomplete. Unless there's a mistake here. Maybe the problem intended that all six angles are expressed in terms of x, but one of them was mistyped. For example, perhaps Angle(F) was meant to be x, but the user forgot to add it. Or maybe Angle(F) is another expression.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the measure of Angle(F) is also expressed in terms of x, but it's not listed. But according to the given data, that's not the case. So this seems like an inconsistency. However, considering that this is a math problem likely designed to have a unique solution, there must be a way to resolve this. Perhaps there's an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the word "Hexagon(A,B,C,D,E,F)" implying that the order of the vertices is such that consecutive angles are adjacent. But how does that affect the angles? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hexagon is regular, but that's conflicting with the given expressions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a missing equation where Angle(F) is related to the others. Wait, could there be a possibility that Angle(F) is the same as another angle? For example, if the hexagon is equiangular, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in combining the terms. Let me recheck the arithmetic.

Sum of angles:

(x -6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + Angle(F) = 720.

Combining x terms:

x + x + x + x = 4x.

Constants:

-6 +4 = -2; -2 +56 = 54; 54 +10 = 64.

So total sum is 4x + 64 + Angle(F) = 720.

Hence, 4x + Angle(F) = 656.

Still stuck with two variables. 

Wait, unless there's an assumption that Angle(F) is zero, but that's impossible because angles in polygons are positive. Or maybe there's a property that the average angle is 120 degrees. Since total is 720, average is 120. So, the average of all six angles is 120. So, the sum of all angles is 720. So, if we consider that, perhaps we can assume that Angle(F) is also expressed in terms of x. But how?

Wait, unless the problem had a typo, and one of the angles was supposed to be Angle(F). For example, maybe the measure of Angle(F) is also given in terms of x. Let me look again. The user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), Sub(x, 6))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), Add(x, 4))

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), x)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D)), 56)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E)), Add(x, 10))

Equals(SumOf(...), 720)"

Wait, maybe there's a missing equation for Angle(F). But according to the given data, there isn't. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hexagon is convex, so each interior angle is less than 180 degrees. So, we can use inequalities to narrow down possibilities. But that might not help us find the exact value of x.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of angles. Wait, the sum of all six angles is 720. So, if we can find the value of Angle(F) in terms of x, then we can solve for x. But how?

Unless there's an implicit assumption that the hexagon is regular, but that's not stated. For example, if it were regular, all angles would be 120. But then we could set each angle equal to 120 and solve for x. Let's see:

For example, suppose Angle(A) = x-6 = 120 → x = 126

Angle(B) = x+4 = 124 → x = 120, which contradicts. So that's inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the angles follow some pattern. For instance, maybe Angle(F) is also related to x. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of angles. Let me count again: the hexagon has six angles, each corresponding to the points A-F. The problem provides expressions for A, B, C, D, E. So, Angle(F) is missing. But the problem must have enough information to solve for x. Therefore, there must be a missing piece. Perhaps Angle(F) is actually the same as one of the other angles? Or maybe there's an error in the problem statement. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the sum of angles A-E plus Angle(F) equals 720, and that Angle(F) is given by another formula. But since it's not mentioned, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there's an alternative interpretation. For example, maybe the problem refers to exterior angles instead of interior angles? But the question specifies "Angle(A)", which typically refers to interior angles. Also, the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees, which doesn't match the given sum of 720. So that's not applicable.

Another thought: maybe the problem is referring to the sum of the angles around each vertex, but that's not standard terminology. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a star-shaped hexagon, but that would complicate things further. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a missing equation where Angle(F) is expressed in terms of x. Let me assume that maybe there was a typo and Angle(F) is also given. For instance, if Angle(F) was supposed to be another expression. For example, if Angle(F) was x, then we'd have:

4x + 64 + x = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2, which is not among the options. 

Or if Angle(F) was 56, then 4x + 64 + 56 = 720 → 4x = 720 - 120 = 600 → x = 150. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if Angle(F) was x+something. But without knowing, this is guesswork.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 56, B. 68, C. 74, D. 84. Let me test these values to see if they make sense.

Assume x is one of these values, and see if the sum of angles equals 720. But since Angle(F) is unknown, this approach may not work. However, maybe the problem intended that Angle(F) is equal to one of the given angles, or there's a different relationship.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the problem, and the sixth angle should be Angle(F) = 56, making it redundant with Angle(D). But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem omitted the measure of Angle(F) and it's actually a typo, and the sixth angle was meant to be another expression. For instance, if Angle(F) was x, then we can solve:

Sum = (x-6)+(x+4)+x+56+(x+10)+x = 5x + ( -6+4+56+10 ) = 5x + 64 = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) was x- something. For example, if Angle(F) was x-6, then sum would be 5x + ... 

But this seems too arbitrary. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that all angles are expressed in terms of x, including Angle(F), and there was a typo in writing the predicates. For example, maybe Angle(F) is x, and the user missed including it. Let me try assuming that. 

Suppose Angle(F) is x. Then:

Sum = (x-6)+(x+4)+x+56+(x+10)+x = 5x + ( -6+4+56+10 ) = 5x + 64 = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2. No match.

If Angle(F) is x + something else. Suppose Angle(F) is x+ something. For example, if Angle(F) is x+ something, but without knowing, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem, and the measure of Angle(D) is not 56, but something else. But that's not indicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the hexagon is regular, so all angles are 120. Let's see:

If all angles are 120, then:

Angle(A): x-6 = 120 → x = 126

Angle(B): x+4 = 124 → x=120, which conflicts.

So that's not possible.

Wait, but maybe the problem has a different structure. Let me try to think differently. What if the problem is not about the interior angles but about something else? But the question mentions "angle(A)", which usually refers to interior angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the sum of the exterior angles. But the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360°, which doesn't fit with the given sum of 720. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or I've missed something. Let me re-read the problem once more.

Wait, the problem states that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(A)), MeasureOf(Angle(B)), MeasureOf(Angle(C)), MeasureOf(Angle(D)), MeasureOf(Angle(E)), and MeasureOf(Angle(F)) is 720. So, that's six angles. The given expressions are for five of them. So, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of angles. Let me count again:

- Angle(A): x-6

- Angle(B): x+4

- Angle(C): x

- Angle(D): 56

- Angle(E): x+10

- Angle(F): ? 

Yes, that's six angles. So, the sixth angle, Angle(F), is missing. Hence, the equation is 4x + 64 + Angle(F) = 720. Without knowing Angle(F), we can't solve for x. 

But since the problem provides answer choices, maybe there's an implied relationship. Let's assume that Angle(F) is also expressed in terms of x, but it's not mentioned. Perhaps the problem had a formatting issue, and Angle(F) was meant to be expressed as well. For example, if Angle(F) was x, then we can solve. Or if Angle(F) is another expression. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the measure of Angle(F) is equal to the measure of Angle(D), which is 56. Let's try that. Assume Angle(F) = 56. Then:

4x + 64 + 56 = 720 → 4x + 120 = 720 → 4x = 600 → x = 150. Still not in the options.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) = x + 10, like Angle(E). Then:

4x + 64 + x +10 = 5x + 74 = 720 → 5x = 646 → x = 129.2. Not matching.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is x - 6, like Angle(A):

4x + 64 + x -6 = 5x + 58 = 720 → 5x = 662 → x = 132.4.

Still no. 

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is 0, which is impossible, but let's see: 4x +64 = 720 → 4x = 656 → x = 164. Not in options.

This suggests that without knowing Angle(F), we can't solve the problem. But since the problem is presented as solvable, there must be a missing piece. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's transcription, and one of the other angles was supposed to be Angle(F). For example, if Angle(F) was meant to be x, and the user missed typing it. Let me assume that Angle(F) is x. Then:

Sum = (x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + x = 5x + 64 = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2. Not matching.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is x + 4, like Angle(B). Then:

Sum = (x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + (x+4) = 5x + ( -6 +4 +56 +10 +4 ) = 5x + 68 = 720 → 5x = 652 → x = 130.4. Still no.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is x + 10, like Angle(E):

Sum = 4x + 64 + x+10 = 5x + 74 = 720 → x = (720-74)/5 = 646/5 = 129.2.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem meant that the sum of angles A-E is 720, excluding Angle(F)? But the problem explicitly says the sum of all six angles is 720.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the measure of Angle(F) is supposed to be x. Let's try that. Even though it's a stretch, but given the answer choices, let's try substituting the options.

Let me assume that Angle(F) is x, then the equation becomes:

(x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + x = 5x + 64 = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2. Not in options.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is 56, then:

4x + 64 + 56 = 720 → 4x = 600 → x = 150. Still not in options.

Wait, the answer choices are 56, 68, 74, 84. Let's try plugging these into the equation. Assuming Angle(F) is something, but how?

Let me try x = 84 (option D). Let's see what happens.

If x = 84, then:

Angle(A): 84 - 6 = 78

Angle(B): 84 + 4 = 88

Angle(C): 84

Angle(D): 56

Angle(E): 84 + 10 = 94

Now, sum of these five angles: 78 + 88 + 84 + 56 + 94 = let's calculate:

78 + 88 = 166

166 + 84 = 250

250 + 56 = 306

306 + 94 = 400

So, the sum of these five angles is 400. Total sum needs to be 720, so Angle(F) = 720 - 400 = 320. Which is impossible because an interior angle of a hexagon cannot be 320 degrees (it exceeds 180, which is possible in concave polygons, but even so, it's very large. But let's see if this fits with other conditions. But since there's no other condition, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, try x = 68 (option B). Let's calculate:

Angle(A): 68 -6 = 62

Angle(B): 68 +4 = 72

Angle(C): 68

Angle(D): 56

Angle(E): 68 +10 = 78

Sum of these five angles: 62 + 72 + 68 + 56 + 78 = 

62 +72 = 134

134 +68 = 202

202 +56 = 258

258 +78 = 336

So, Angle(F) = 720 - 336 = 384. Again, extremely large.

Try x = 74 (option C):

Angle(A): 74-6 = 68

Angle(B): 74+4=78

Angle(C):74

Angle(D):56

Angle(E):74+10=84

Sum: 68 +78 +74 +56 +84 = 

68+78=146; 146+74=220; 220+56=276; 276+84=360. So Angle(F) = 720-360=360. Still huge.

x=56 (option A):

Angle(A):56-6=50

Angle(B):56+4=60

Angle(C):56

Angle(D):56

Angle(E):56+10=66

Sum:50+60+56+56+66 = 

50+60=110; 110+56=166; 166+56=222; 222+66=288. Angle(F)=720-288=432. Still impossible.

None of these seem plausible. This suggests that either the problem is flawed, or there's a missing piece. 

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that the sum of angles A-E is 720, and Angle(F) is not part of it? But the problem explicitly says the sum of all six angles is 720.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of Angle(F) is 56, which is the same as Angle(D). Let's try that. Then:

With x = 84 (option D), Angle(F) = 56. Let's check if that works. 

Wait, if Angle(F) is 56, then total sum would be 4x + 64 + 56 = 4x + 120 = 720 → 4x = 600 → x = 150. Not in options.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is 56, and x is 68 (option B):

4x + 64 + 56 = 4*68 + 64 + 56 = 272 + 120 = 392 ≠ 720.

Nope.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Given that, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the correct answer is B.68, but I can't justify it. Alternatively, maybe I missed a step. Let me re-express the equation with the assumption that Angle(F) is x, and see what x would be. 

Even though this is a guess, let's proceed:

If Angle(F) = x, then:

(x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + x = 5x + 64 = 720 → 5x = 656 → x = 131.2. Not in options.

But if the problem had Angle(F) = x-6, then:

Sum = (x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) + (x-6) = 5x + ( -6 +4 +56 +10 -6 ) = 5x + 58 = 720 → 5x = 662 → x = 132.4. Still no.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) = x+4, then:

Sum = 4x + 64 + x+4 = 5x + 68 = 720 → x = (720 - 68)/5 = 652/5 = 130.4. No.

Wait, but the answer choices are A.56, B.68, C.74, D.84. Let's try plugging x=84 into the equation, assuming that Angle(F) is some value. Let's say x=84, then the sum of the five angles is 78 + 88 + 84 + 56 + 94 = 400, as before. So Angle(F) = 720 - 400 = 320. Now, is there any reason why Angle(F) would be 320? That would mean the hexagon is highly concave, but it's possible. However, without any additional constraints, this is arbitrary.

But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended solution assumes that Angle(F) is 56, and there was a mistake in the problem. Let's try that. If Angle(F) = 56, then:

4x + 64 + 56 = 720 → 4x = 600 → x = 150. Not in options.

Alternatively, if Angle(F) is 56, and there's a calculation error, maybe the sum of angles is 720, but the given expressions have an error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the sum of angles A-E is 720, and Angle(F) is not included. Let's try that. Then:

Sum of A-E: (x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) = 4x + 64 = 720 → 4x = 656 → x = 164. Not in options.

No.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the sum of angles A-D is 720, but that's not what it says.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's either a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing a critical insight. Given the answer choices, perhaps the intended solution assumes that Angle(F) is x, leading to 5x + 64 = 720, which gives x = (720 - 64)/5 = 656/5 = 131.2, which is not an option. Alternatively, if there's a different assumption, like Angle(F) is 56, leading to x = 150, which is also not an option.

But since the answer choices are given, perhaps the correct answer is B.68. Let me try to see if there's a way to get 68.

Let me assume that the sum of all angles is 720, and that Angle(F) is 56. Then, the equation is 4x + 64 + 56 = 720 → 4x = 600 → x = 150. Not matching.

But if I assume that Angle(F) is 56, and there's an error in the problem, perhaps the correct x is 68. Let's see:

If x = 68, then:

Angle(A): 68-6=62

Angle(B): 68+4=72

Angle(C):68

Angle(D):56

Angle(E):68+10=78

Sum of these five angles: 62 +72 +68 +56 +78 = 62+72=134, 134+68=202, 202+56=258, 258+78=336. So Angle(F) = 720 - 336 = 384. Which is not valid, but if there's a miscalculation here, perhaps the problem assumes that Angle(F) is 384, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the sum of angles A-E is 720, and Angle(F) is not part of it. Then, 4x + 64 = 720 → x = (720 - 64)/4 = 656/4 = 164. Still not in options.

I'm at a loss. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is B.68, and there's a mistake in the problem. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me double-check the initial sum.

The sum of the five angles (A-E) is:

(x-6) + (x+4) + x + 56 + (x+10) = x-6 + x+4 + x + 56 + x+10 = 4x + ( -6 +4 +56 +10 ) = 4x + 64. Yes, correct. 

So, if we assume that Angle(F) is zero, then 4x + 64 = 720 → x = (720-64)/4 = 656/4 = 164. Still not in options.

Alternatively, if there's a missing minus sign somewhere, but I don't see it.

Given that I'm unable to find a consistent solution, but the answer choices are present, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let me try x = 68 (option B). Let's plug it into the equation with Angle(F) = 384, even though it's invalid. But if the problem assumes that Angle(F) is 56, then x would be 150. Not in options.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem and the measure of Angle(D) is x instead of 56. Let's try that. Let's say Angle(D) is x. Then, the sum would be:

(x-6) + (x+4) + x + x + (x+10) + Angle(F) = 5x -6 +4 +10 + Angle(F) = 5x + 8 + Angle(F) = 720. Still two variables.

Alternatively, if Angle(D) is x, and Angle(F) is x, then 5x + 8 + x = 6x +8 = 720 → 6x = 712 → x = 118.666... Not in options.

This is getting nowhere. Given the lack of progress, I'll have to choose one of the options. Let's try x=84 (option D). Let's see:

If x=84, then the five angles are 78, 88, 84, 56, 94. Their sum is 78+88=166, +84=250, +56=306, +94=400. So Angle(F) = 720 - 400 = 320. Now, 320 is greater than 180, which is possible in a concave hexagon. But why would that be the case? If the problem assumes that all angles are less than 180, then this is invalid. But if it allows for concave angles, then it's possible. However, without any other constraints, this is arbitrary. But since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are given, perhaps this is the intended solution, and the answer is D.84.

But why would Angle(F) be 320? It's possible, but I don't see how it connects to the other angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the sum of the angles is 720, and there's a miscalculation in the number of angles. For example, if the hexagon is actually a pentagon, but that's not what's stated.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to go with one of the options. Since x=84 leads to a possible scenario, even though it's not ideal, I'll choose D.84.
