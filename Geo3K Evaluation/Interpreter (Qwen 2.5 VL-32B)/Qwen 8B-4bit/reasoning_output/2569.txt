Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

So, we have several points labeled F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, J. There's a circle J, and all these points lie on it. The lines connect them in a cyclic manner: F-A-G-C-H-E-B-I-F. Also, there are angles mentioned at points A and C. Specifically, angle FAG measures 110 degrees, and angle GCH measures 150 degrees. The question asks for angle 5, but since the options are given as A-D, I need to figure out which angle corresponds to angle 5 based on the diagram implied by the connections.

First, let me visualize the points. All points are on circle J, so they form a polygon? Let me check the connections again. The lines are F-A, A-G, G-C, C-H, H-E, E-B, B-I, I-F. So connecting those points in order would make an octagon? Wait, but there are eight points here: F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I. Each connected sequentially. But also, there's another line AC, which connects point A to point C directly. Similarly, maybe other diagonals?

But the main thing is that all points are on a circle, so this is a cyclic polygon. Now, angles at certain vertices are given. Angle FAG is at vertex A, between points F, A, G. That's one angle. Then angle GCH is at vertex C, between points G, C, H. These angles are given as 110° and 150° respectively.

Now, angle 5 refers to some angle in this configuration. Since the answer choices are 50, 110, 130, 150, I need to find which angle fits. Let me think about how these angles relate.

Since all points are on a circle, the angles formed by chords might relate to arcs. For example, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, angle FAG is at point A, with sides AF and AG. Since A is on the circle, AF and AG are chords of the circle. Therefore, angle FAG is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FG. Wait, but the angle at A intercepts arc from F to G passing through the opposite side of the circle. Wait, but if we consider the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle FAG would be half the measure of the arc FG that it intercepts. But since the points are arranged in order around the circle, the arc FG would depend on the position of the points.

Wait, let me clarify the order of the points on the circle. The lines go F-A-G-C-H-E-B-I-F. So arranging the points in order along the circumference: starting at F, then A, then G, then C, then H, then E, then B, then I, back to F. So the order around the circle is F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, forming an octagon. Therefore, each adjacent pair is connected by a line segment. So moving clockwise around the circle, the points are ordered F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I.

Therefore, the arc from F to A is one edge, A to G next, etc. Now, angle FAG is at point A, between points F, A, G. So the angle between chords AF and AG. In terms of the circle, this angle is formed by two chords meeting at A. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle FAG would be half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no—when two chords meet at a point on the circle, the angle formed is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, actually, the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but angle at A between AF and AG would intercept arc FG. However, depending on which arc is considered, the major or minor arc. Since the points are arranged in order, the arc from F to G going through A would be the arc that doesn't pass through the rest of the points. Wait, but since the points are in order F, A, G, C,..., the arc from F to G passing through A would be the shorter arc. But if the points are arranged such that F, A, G are consecutive, then the arc FG would be the arc that goes from F to G via A, which is just the sum of arcs FA and AG. But since the entire circle is 360 degrees, we need to compute the arcs.

Alternatively, perhaps angle FAG is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FG. Wait, but if the angle is at point A, then the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle, i.e., the arc from F to G that does not contain A. Wait, but since the points are arranged in order, the arc FG that does not contain A would be the longer arc. Wait, but in a circle, the inscribed angle intercepts the arc that's opposite the angle. So angle at A intercepts arc FG that's not containing A. Wait, but if the points are arranged as F, A, G, C,..., then the arc from F to G that doesn't contain A would be the arc going the long way around the circle through the other points. However, since the total circle is 360 degrees, the measure of angle FAG would be half the measure of that arc. Alternatively, if the angle is formed by two chords AF and AG, then the intercepted arc is FG. But the measure of the angle depends on whether it's a minor or major arc. 

But given that angle FAG is 110 degrees, which is more than 90 degrees, so it must be intercepting a larger arc. Because if the angle was less than 90, it would be half of a minor arc. Wait, but 110 degrees times 2 is 220 degrees. So the arc FG that's intercepted would be 220 degrees. Which would mean that the arc from F to G going the long way around the circle is 220 degrees. Therefore, the arc from F to G passing through the other points (not through A) would be 220 degrees. Therefore, the arc length from F to G (the major arc) is 220 degrees. Hence, the minor arc FG would be 360 - 220 = 140 degrees. 

Similarly, angle GCH is at point C, between points G, C, H. So that's another inscribed angle. Given that angle GCH is 150 degrees, which would imply that the intercepted arc GH is twice that, 300 degrees. Wait, but again, depending on which arc is intercepted. Wait, angle at C intercepts arc GH. So if the angle is 150 degrees, then the intercepted arc would be 300 degrees. Therefore, the arc from G to H going the long way around the circle would be 300 degrees. Thus, the minor arc GH would be 360 - 300 = 60 degrees. 

Now, considering the entire circle, we can try to calculate the arcs between each consecutive points. Let's note down the arcs. 

Starting with the arc from F to A: Let's denote the arc FA as x, arc AG as y, arc GC as z, arc CH as w, arc HE as u, arc EB as v, arc BI as t, and arc IF as s. Since the total circumference is 360 degrees, we have:

x + y + z + w + u + v + t + s = 360.

But from earlier, we found that the arc FG (from F to G, not passing through A) is 220 degrees. But arc FG can be broken down as arc FA (x) plus arc AG (y). Wait, but arc FG is the arc from F to G that does not pass through A. Wait, but in our arrangement, the points are F, A, G, C,... So the arc FG that passes through A is x + y. But the arc that doesn't pass through A would be the rest of the circle. Wait, but earlier calculation said that angle FAG intercepts the arc FG not containing A, which would be the arc going from F to G through the other points, which would be arc FI + IB + BC + CH + HG... Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe my initial assumption was wrong.

Let me re-examine angle FAG. The angle at point A between segments AF and AG. The intercepted arc would be the arc FG that does not include A. So, in the circle, the arc from F to G that doesn't pass through A. Since the points are in order F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, then the arc from F to G not passing through A would go through I, B, E, H, C, and then to G. Wait, but that's a long arc. The measure of that arc would be 360 minus the measure of arc FG that includes A. Arc FG including A is the arc from F to G through A, which is arc FA (x) plus arc AG (y). Therefore, the measure of angle FAG is half the measure of the arc FG not containing A, which is (360 - (x + y)) / 2. And according to the given, angle FAG is 110 degrees. So:

(360 - (x + y)) / 2 = 110  
=> 360 - (x + y) = 220  
=> x + y = 140 degrees.

Similarly, for angle GCH at point C between G, C, H. This angle intercepts arc GH not containing C. The arc from G to H not containing C would go through the rest of the circle except the arc GC and CH. Wait, the arc GH not containing C would be the arc going through the other points. Let me think again. The points are in order G, C, H, E, B, I, F, A. So the arc from G to H not containing C would go through the rest of the circle. The measure of angle GCH is half the measure of that arc. Given that angle GCH is 150 degrees, so:

( measure of arc GH not containing C ) / 2 = 150  
=> measure of arc GH not containing C = 300 degrees.  

Thus, the arc from G to H not containing C is 300 degrees, which implies that the arc from G to H containing C (which is arc GC + CH) is 360 - 300 = 60 degrees. So arc GC + arc CH = 60 degrees. Let me denote arc GC as z and arc CH as w. So z + w = 60 degrees.

Now, let's summarize:

From angle FAG: x + y = 140 degrees.  
From angle GCH: z + w = 60 degrees.  

We also know that the entire circle adds up to 360 degrees. So:

arc FA (x) + arc AG (y) + arc GC (z) + arc CH (w) + arc HE (u) + arc EB (v) + arc BI (t) + arc IF (s) = 360.

But we don't know the other arcs yet. However, perhaps we can find relations between these arcs.

Additionally, since all points are on the circle, the arcs between consecutive points are x, y, z, w, u, v, t, s. Wait, but the order is F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I. So between F and A is x, A and G is y, G and C is z, C and H is w, H and E is u, E and B is v, B and I is t, I and F is s. So yes, those arcs.

So total arcs: x + y + z + w + u + v + t + s = 360.

We already know that x + y = 140, and z + w = 60. So substituting:

140 + 60 + u + v + t + s = 360  
=> 200 + u + v + t + s = 360  
=> u + v + t + s = 160 degrees.

But without more info, it's hard to proceed. However, maybe we can find other angles or use symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about angle 5. But what is angle 5 referring to? Since the problem mentions angle 5, but in the given, there are angles at points A and C. Perhaps angle 5 is another angle formed by the intersection of lines or something else. Wait, the problem statement says "Find ∠5." But the original problem may refer to a standard numbering of angles in the diagram. Since the diagram isn't provided, I need to infer based on the given data.

Looking at the points and connections, maybe angle 5 refers to an angle formed by intersecting chords or something else. Alternatively, perhaps angle 5 is referring to an angle inside the circle, like the angle at point I or another point.

Alternatively, since there are multiple angles mentioned, maybe angle 5 is part of a set of angles formed by the intersections. Wait, but the given angles are at A and C. Let me think.

Another possibility: since all points are on a circle, and there are various chords, maybe angle 5 is an inscribed angle corresponding to a particular arc. Or perhaps it's an exterior angle or something else.

Wait, but maybe the problem refers to a specific angle in the diagram. For instance, in some problems, angles are numbered sequentially. Given that there are several angles formed by the intersecting chords, perhaps angle 5 refers to a specific one. Without seeing the actual diagram, this is challenging, but maybe we can deduce based on the existing information.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to angle at point I or another point. Let's look for other angles.

For example, looking at the lines: Line(I,F), Line(B,I), Line(E,B), etc. So there are several points connected. Maybe there are other angles formed by these lines. For example, angle at point I between points B, I, F. Or angle at point B between points E, B, I. But since the problem mentions angle 5, perhaps there's a pattern in the diagram where angles are numbered.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is referring to the angle at point I or another point. But how to determine which angle it is?

Wait, perhaps the angles given are angles 1 and 2, and angle 5 is another one. But without knowing the diagram, this is tricky. However, given that the answer choices include 50, 110, 130, 150, and we have angles of 110 and 150 given, maybe angle 5 is another angle formed by intersecting chords, possibly using the arcs we've calculated.

Wait, let me recall that in a circle, the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Additionally, if two chords intersect inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But since all points are on the circle, any angle formed by two chords at a point on the circle would be an inscribed angle.

Alternatively, if there are intersecting chords inside the circle, but in this case, all points are on the circle. So maybe angle 5 is an inscribed angle intercepting a particular arc.

Wait, let's think about the arcs we found. We had arc FG (non-containing A) as 220 degrees, and arc GH non-containing C as 300 degrees. From that, we could derive some arcs.

Earlier, we had arc FA + arc AG = 140 degrees (x + y = 140). And arc GC + arc CH = 60 degrees (z + w = 60).

Also, the total of the remaining arcs (u + v + t + s) is 160 degrees.

But perhaps there are other arcs that we can find. For example, if we consider the arc from H to E (u), E to B (v), B to I (t), and I to F (s). But without more information, it's difficult.

However, maybe there's a way to find other angles. For instance, suppose we consider angle at point I between points B, I, F. That angle would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc BF. Let's say that angle is angle BIF. Its measure would be half the measure of arc BF. But unless we know arc BF, we can't calculate it. However, arc BF would be the sum of arcs from B to I to F. Wait, arc from B to I is t, and from I to F is s. So arc BF would be t + s. Therefore, angle BIF would be (t + s)/2. But we don't know t + s.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to an angle formed by intersecting chords. For example, if there's an intersection of lines, but all points are on the circle. Unless there are diagonals crossing inside the circle. Wait, the given lines are only the ones connecting consecutive points, but maybe there are other diagonals. For example, the line AC is given as a line. So point A to point C. Similarly, other diagonals may exist.

Wait, in the problem statement, there's a Line(A,C). So that's a diagonal connecting A and C. Similarly, maybe other diagonals. So perhaps angle 5 is formed by intersecting chords. For example, if two chords intersect, creating vertical angles. But without knowing where, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to an angle formed at point J, but J is the center of the circle. Wait, the circle is named J, so point J is the center? Or is J the name of the circle? Wait, the first predicate says Circle(J). So J is the circle, not a point. Wait, wait! Wait, the predicate says Point(J)? No, the user wrote:

"Circle(J)
Point(F)
Point(A)
Point(G)
Point(C)
Point(H)
Point(E)
Point(B)
Point(I)
Point(J)"

Wait, hold on! Wait, the user listed Point(J) as well. Oh! So J is both a circle and a point? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the first line says "Circle(J)", then later lists "Point(J)". So J is both a circle and a point? That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but assuming that J is the circle, and there's also a point named J. Wait, but the initial list has Point(J) as a separate entry. So there is a point J and a circle J? That would be confusing. Wait, but in standard notation, a circle is usually denoted by its center. So maybe J is the center of the circle. Wait, but the first predicate is Circle(J), implying that J is the name of the circle. But then later, there's a Point(J), which would be a point named J. So that suggests that the circle is named J and there is also a point named J. That's possible, though unusual. So J is both the circle and a point? Or perhaps it's a mistake, and J is the center. But the problem mentions Point(J), so J is a point. So the circle is named J, and there's a point also named J. Hmm. This complicates things. 

Wait, but in the given predicates, there's a Line(A,C) and PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(J)). So point A lies on circle J. Similarly for other points. So circle J contains all these points: F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I. So the circle J has these eight points on its circumference. Then, there's a point J as well, which is also on the circle? Wait, because there's a Point(J) listed. So point J is one of the points on the circle. Wait, but the initial list has points F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and then J. So there are nine points? Wait, the initial list includes Point(J), so J is a point. So the circle J contains points F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and J itself? That would mean that the circle J has nine points on it. But that's possible. So J is a point on the circle named J. So the circle's name is J, and one of its points is also named J. That's allowed.

So, in this case, the circle is named J, and there's a point J lying on it. So the center of the circle is not necessarily point J. Wait, but how do we know where the center is? It's unclear. However, since all points are on the circle, and J is one of them, so J is a point on the circle. So the circle has radius determined by the distance from the center to any of the points, but we don't know where the center is. However, since the problem involves angles and arcs, maybe we can work with that.

But returning to the problem: angle 5. Assuming that angle 5 refers to an angle formed by intersecting chords or something else. Let me think differently. Suppose that the diagram forms a star or has intersecting chords. For example, if there are diagonals crossing, creating angles. For instance, if lines like AC, BI, etc., intersect somewhere inside the circle, creating angles. For example, if line AC intersects with line BI at some point, creating angles. But without knowing where, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to an inscribed angle intercepting a particular arc. For instance, if we can find the measure of an arc, we can find the corresponding angle. 

Previously, we had:

Arc FA + arc AG = 140 degrees  
Arc GC + arc CH = 60 degrees  
Total of other arcs = 160 degrees.

But without more info, we can't directly find individual arcs. However, perhaps we can consider other angles. For example, the angle at point B between points E, B, I. Let's call that angle EBI. What's the measure of that angle? It would be half the measure of the arc EI not containing B. The arc from E to I not containing B would be arc E to I through the other points. Let's see, the points are E, B, I, F, A, G, C, H. So the arc from E to I not containing B would go through F, A, G, C, H. So that arc would be arc EF + FA + AG + GC + CH + HI? Wait, no. Wait, the arc from E to I not containing B would be the arc that goes from E to I through F, A, G, C, H, and then to I. But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The arc from E to I not containing B would be the arc that goes from E to I through the points not involving B. Given the points are arranged in order E, B, I, F, A, G, C, H. So the arc from E to I not containing B would go through F, A, G, C, H. Wait, but the arc from E to I passing through F, A, G, C, H would be arc EF + FA + AG + GC + CH + HI? Wait, no. Let me break it down. The arc from E to I not containing B would be the arc that starts at E, goes through F, A, G, C, H, and ends at I. So that would be the sum of arcs EF, FA, AG, GC, CH, HI. Wait, but I is connected to F. So arc HI is from H to I, and then arc IF is from I to F. Wait, but we're trying to get from E to I. So from E to I via F, A, G, C, H. So arc EF + FA + AG + GC + CH + HI? No, because from E to F is one arc (EF), then F to A (FA), A to G (AG), G to C (GC), C to H (CH), H to I (HI). So total arc length from E to I through those points is EF + FA + AG + GC + CH + HI. But we don't know the measure of these arcs. 

This seems too vague. Let me think of another approach. Since we have two angles given, maybe we can find other angles using the fact that the sum of arcs equals 360 degrees. 

We know that arc FA + arc AG = 140 degrees.  
Arc GC + arc CH = 60 degrees.  
Other arcs add up to 160 degrees. 

Suppose we consider the arc from A to C. Since there is a line AC, which connects A to C. This chord divides the circle into two arcs: arc AC (minor or major). The measure of angle at point J? Wait, no. Wait, if we consider the angle subtended by arc AC at the center, it would be the central angle. But we don't know where point J is located. However, since J is a point on the circle, and all other points are on the same circle, then point J is one of the points F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I. Wait, no, the points are F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and J. Wait, earlier I thought that J is a point on the circle. So the circle J has points F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and J. So there are nine points on the circle. So the arc from A to C would be arc AC, which could be arc AG + GC = y + z. Earlier, we had y + z = ? Wait, no, arc AG is y, arc GC is z. So arc from A to C via G is y + z. But since arc FA + AG = x + y = 140, and arc GC + CH = z + w = 60. So arc AC via G is y + z. But we don't know the value of y + z individually. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at point J? Wait, point J is on the circle. If we consider the angle at point J, but the problem doesn't mention any angles at J. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to the angle at point J. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but the problem says "Find ∠5". In many standardized tests, sometimes angles are labeled sequentially, like ∠1, ∠2, ..., ∠5. If the diagram shows multiple angles formed by intersecting lines, then ∠5 could be one of them. For example, if there are several intersecting chords creating multiple angles, ∠5 might be one of them.

Given that there are several lines: F-A-G-C-H-E-B-I-F, and also line AC. Let's imagine drawing these lines. The lines form an octagon, and there's a diagonal AC. So, for example, line AC connects A to C, which are two points separated by one other point (G). So, in this octagon, AC is a diagonal skipping one vertex.

In such cases, the angle formed at point A between AF and AC could be another angle. Or at point C between CA and CG. But how does that relate to the given angles?

Alternatively, since we have angles at A and C, maybe angle 5 is formed by another intersection. For example, if lines AC and BI intersect at some point inside the circle, creating vertical angles. Let's assume that. If that's the case, then the measure of the angle formed by intersecting chords can be calculated using the formula: the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

But to apply that, we need to identify the intercepted arcs. For instance, if two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Assuming that angle 5 is formed by the intersection of two chords, say AC and BI. Let's say they intersect at some point inside the circle. Then the angle at that intersection would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But to calculate that, we need to know which arcs are intercepted.

But without knowing where the intersection occurs, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that angle 5 is formed by the intersection of AC and BI, then we could calculate it.

Let me try this approach. Assume that angle 5 is formed at the intersection of chords AC and BI. Let's call the intersection point X. Then, the measure of angle AXB (assuming X is the intersection) would be half the sum of the arcs AB and CI. Wait, no. When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So if chords AC and BI intersect at X, then angle AXB is half the sum of the arcs AB and CI. 

But to calculate this, we need to know the measures of arcs AB and CI. Let's see if we can find those.

First, arc AB: from A to B. The points are ordered as F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I. So arc from A to B would go through G, C, H, E, B. Wait, but arc AB could be either the short arc or the long arc. Depending on the direction. Since the points are in order, the arc from A to B going through G, C, H, E is the arc AB that contains the rest of the points. But since we're dealing with the intersection of chords AC and BI, the intercepted arcs would be AB and CI.

But to compute the measure of angle AXB, we need the sum of arcs AB and CI divided by 2. Let's attempt to find these arcs.

First, arc AB: from A to B. The arc AB can be calculated as follows. Starting from A, the arc to B can be arc AG + GC + CH + HE + EB. Wait, but that's going through G, C, H, E, B. Or alternatively, the arc from A to B directly. But since the points are in order F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, the arc from A to B that doesn't pass through the other points would be the arc from A to B through I, F, ...? No, because the points are in order. So the arc AB that is shorter would be going through the points in the order A, G, C, H, E, B. But that's the long arc, or the short arc?

Actually, the arc AB that is shorter would depend on the number of points between A and B. Since the points are in order F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, the arc from A to B can be either the arc going through G, C, H, E, B (which is longer) or the arc going through I, F, ... but that would be the other way. Wait, the arc from A to B can be measured in two ways: clockwise or counterclockwise. Since the circle is closed, the shorter arc is typically considered. But without knowing the exact arc lengths, it's hard to determine. 

Alternatively, since we know the total circumference is 360 degrees, and we have some partial arcs. Recall that x + y = 140 (arc FA + AG), z + w = 60 (arc GC + CH), and the remaining arcs (u + v + t + s) = 160 degrees. 

Let me define the arcs as follows:

- arc FA = x
- arc AG = y
- arc GC = z
- arc CH = w
- arc HE = u
- arc EB = v
- arc BI = t
- arc IF = s

With x + y = 140, z + w = 60, and u + v + t + s = 160.

Now, arc AB: from A to B. To get from A to B, you can go through G, C, H, E, B (which is arc AG + GC + CH + HE + EB = y + z + w + u + v). Or the other way around, through I, F, ... which would be arc AF + FI + IB = x + s + t. 

But which arc is shorter? Without knowing the exact measures, we can't be sure. However, if we assume that the shorter arc is the one that is smaller, but since we don't have enough info, maybe we can express the measure of angle AXB in terms of these variables.

Assume that the angle formed by intersecting chords AC and BI is at point X. The measure of this angle is ½ (arc AB + arc CI). Let's find arc AB and arc CI.

Arc AB: as above, either y + z + w + u + v or x + s + t. Let's take the first option: arc AB = y + z + w + u + v.

Arc CI: from C to I. The arc from C to I can be arc CH + HE + EB + BI = w + u + v + t, or the other way around, arc CG + GA + AF + FI = z + y + x + s. Again, which is shorter?

But again, without knowing, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps we can relate these arcs using the total circumference.

Total circumference: x + y + z + w + u + v + t + s = 360.

From this, we can express arc AB (assuming the first path): y + z + w + u + v = (y + z + w) + u + v = (60) + u + v. Since z + w = 60.

And arc CI (assuming the first path): w + u + v + t = (w + u + v) + t. But we know that u + v + t + s = 160, so w + u + v + t = w + (u + v + t) = w + (160 - s).

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle 5 might be an external angle or something else. Wait, another idea: since all points are on the circle, and we have certain arcs, maybe angle 5 is an inscribed angle that we can calculate from the known arcs.

For example, if there's an angle at point I between points B, I, F. As before, this would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc BF. Arc BF would be from B to F. Let's calculate that. The arc from B to F can be arc BE + EF + FA = v + u + x. Or the other way around, arc BI + IF = t + s. But again, without knowing specific values, it's hard. But if we can express this in terms of known quantities.

Wait, we know that x + y = 140, z + w = 60, and u + v + t + s = 160. Let me try to find expressions for arc BF.

Arc BF could be arc BI + IF = t + s, or arc BE + EF + FA = v + u + x. Let's assume it's the shorter arc. If we can find the measure of arc BF, then angle at I would be half of that.

But without knowing t + s or v + u + x, it's still stuck.

Wait, but if we consider that the total of u + v + t + s = 160, and we need to find t + s or v + u + x. Let me see:

If we take arc BF as t + s, then angle at I would be (t + s)/2. But we don't know t + s. However, if we can relate t + s to other arcs. 

But let's think about the arc from F to B. The arc FB can also be expressed as arc FI + IB = s + t. So, arc FB = s + t. 

But we also have arc FB = 360 - arc BF (wait, no). Wait, the arc from F to B could be measured in two directions. The shorter arc is s + t, and the longer arc would be the rest. But since we don't know, it's ambiguous.

This seems too vague. Perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Let me revisit the given angles. We know angle FAG is 110°, which we associated with arc FG being 220°, leading to arc FA + AG = 140°. And angle GCH is 150°, leading to arc GH being 300°, hence arc GC + CH = 60°. 

Now, what about the arc from H to E? Let's denote that as u. And from E to B as v, from B to I as t, from I to F as s. 

If I consider the angle at point H between points C, H, E. That would be angle CHE. Let's calculate that. It would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE. The measure of angle CHE would be half the measure of arc CE. 

What is arc CE? From C to E. The arc from C to E can be arc CH + HE = w + u, or the other way around. Let's assume it's the shorter arc. If we can find the measure of arc CE, then angle CHE would be half of that. 

But without knowing w + u, it's still unknown. However, if we can relate this to other parts. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the arcs. Since we have arc FA + AG = 140, arc GC + CH = 60, and the rest adding to 160. 

Let me consider the arc from A to C. It's either arc AG + GC = y + z, or the other way around. Let's say it's arc AC = y + z. Then, the angle at point J? No. Wait, if there is a point J on the circle, and if we consider the angle at point J between points A and C, it would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. But since J is a point on the circle, the measure of that angle would be half the measure of arc AC. But we don't know where J is located on the circle. 

Wait, but J is one of the points on the circle. Let me check the points: F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, J. So J is one of these points. Wait, the initial list includes Point(J), so J is one of the points. So the circle has nine points: F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, J. So J is one of the points on the circle. 

Therefore, if J is one of the points, say, J is one of the points in the sequence. Let me check the order. The points are in the order F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and then J. Wait, but the initial line connections are F-A-G-C-H-E-B-I-F. So J must be one of these points. Wait, the initial list includes Point(J), so J is one of the points. But in the given lines, there's no connection to J. Wait, but the lines are F-A, A-G, G-C, C-H, H-E, E-B, B-I, I-F. So J is a point on the circle, but not connected to any lines explicitly. So J is a point on the circle, but not part of the octagon? Or is it part of it?

Wait, the circle J has points F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and J. So J is one of the points. Let me assume that J is one of the points in the sequence. But the sequence of points in the lines is F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I, and then back to F. Where is J in this sequence? It could be inserted somewhere. For example, maybe J is point I? No, because there is a point I. Or maybe J is point B? Or another point. This is unclear. 

But if J is a point on the circle, then the angle at J between two points would be an inscribed angle. For example, if J is point C, then angle at C between points B, C, D... but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the central angle. If J is the center of the circle, then the central angle would be twice the inscribed angle. But earlier, I assumed that J is a point on the circle, not the center. This is confusing. 

Wait, the first predicate is Circle(J), which means the circle is named J. The second is Point(J), so J is a point on the circle. So J is both a circle and a point? That doesn't make sense. Probably, it's a mistake, and J is the center of the circle. Let me assume that J is the center of the circle. That would make sense, as it's common to name circles by their centers. So J is the center, and all the other points are on the circle. 

That changes everything. If J is the center, then the lines from J to each point are radii. But the problem states that Point(J) is a point, so J is on the circle. Wait, but if J is the center, it cannot be on the circle, since the center is inside. This contradiction suggests that J is a point on the circle. 

This confusion indicates that there might be a mistake in the problem statement, but I'll proceed under the assumption that J is a point on the circle, and that the circle is named J. 

Back to the problem. With this ambiguity, perhaps I should focus on the given angles and arcs. 

We have angle FAG = 110°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FG = 220°, as previously reasoned. And angle GCH = 150°, intercepting arc GH = 300°. 

Now, let's consider the arc from G to H, which is 300°, so the minor arc GH is 60°, as before. 

Now, if we consider the arc from F to G, which is 220°, so the minor arc FG is 140° (since 360 - 220 = 140). Wait, no: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle FAG is 110°, then the intercepted arc is 220°, which is the major arc FG. So the minor arc FG would be 360 - 220 = 140°. 

So minor arc FG = 140°, and minor arc GH = 60°. 

Now, what about the arc from F to H? It would be arc FG + GH = 140 + 60 = 200°. So the arc from F to H is 200°. 

But what about the arc from F to H passing through other points? If we consider the arc from F to H through A, G, C, H, that's the arc FH which is 200°, as above. 

Now, what about the angle at point H between points G, H, E. That angle is angle GHE. Let's calculate it. It would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc GE. 

To find arc GE, we need to determine the measure of arc from G to E. Let's see: from G to E, passing through C, H, E. That arc is arc GC + CH + HE = z + w + u. Or the other way around. But we know z + w = 60, and u is part of the remaining arcs. 

But we also know that the total of the remaining arcs (u + v + t + s) = 160. 

But without more info, it's still difficult. 

Alternatively, let's consider the arc from G to E. If we can find it, we can calculate angle GHE. 

But maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the total of all arcs. 

We have:

arc FG (major) = 220° => minor arc FG = 140° = x + y.

arc GH (major) = 300° => minor arc GH = 60° = z + w.

Other arcs: u + v + t + s = 160.

Now, let's consider the arc from F to E. This can be calculated as arc FG + GH + HE = 140 + 60 + u = 200 + u. Or the other way around. 

But if we can find the measure of arc FE, then the angle at point B or elsewhere might be calculable. 

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should consider that the answer is related to the supplementary angles or something. 

Given the options are 50, 110, 130, 150. We already have 110 and 150 given. The missing angle could be 50 or 130. 

Let me think: if angle 5 is formed by two arcs whose measures add up to 220°, then the angle would be 110°, but that's already given. Or if it's formed by arcs adding to 260°, then angle would be 130°. Or if it's formed by
