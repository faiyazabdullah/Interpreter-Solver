Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given information and figure out how the shapes and their properties relate to each other. 

We have a rectangle LMNP and a parallelogram LKJM. The points mentioned are L, M, N, P for the rectangle, and L, K, M, J for the parallelogram. Also, there are lines involved: Line(L,N), Line(L,J), and Line(P,J). The lengths given are LN = 10, LJ = 2x + 1, and PJ = 3x - 1. We need to find the value of x.

Starting with the rectangle LMNP. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, if LN is one side, then the opposite side would be MP, and they should be equal. But wait, the rectangle is named LMNP, so the vertices are connected as L-M-N-P-L? Wait, rectangles have four sides, so maybe the order is L, M, N, P connected in order. Let me visualize that. If it's a rectangle, then LM and NP are opposite sides, and MN and LP are opposite sides. Alternatively, maybe it's L connected to M and P? Wait, the line segments given are Line(L,N) and Line(L,J). Hmm, perhaps I need to sketch mentally.

But first, since it's a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, for example, LM is perpendicular to MN. Now, considering the parallelogram LKJM. Parallelograms have opposite sides equal and parallel. So, in parallelogram LKJM, sides LK and MJ are equal and parallel, and LM and KJ are equal and parallel. Wait, but the points here are L, K, M, J. So the sides would be LK, KM, MJ, JL? Or maybe LK, KJ, JM, ML? Wait, the order matters. In a parallelogram, the order of the letters defines the sides. So L connected to K, K connected to J, J connected to M, and M connected back to L? That would make a parallelogram where LK is parallel and equal to JM, and KJ is parallel and equal to ML.

Now, looking at the lines given: Line(L,N), Line(L,J), and Line(P,J). Also, we know that LN is a side of the rectangle, which has length 10. Since LN is part of the rectangle, and in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if LN is one side, then the adjacent sides would be LM and LP. Wait, but maybe LN is actually a diagonal? Wait, no—because in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but the problem states that LN is a line segment with length 10, which is given as LengthOf(Line(L,N)) equals 10. So LN is a side of the rectangle?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The rectangle is LMNP. So the sides would be LM, MN, NP, PL. Therefore, LN would be a diagonal connecting L to N. Because in a rectangle, the diagonals connect opposite corners. For example, if the rectangle is L-M-N-P-L, then the diagonals would be LN and MP. Therefore, LN is a diagonal, not a side. Wait, but that contradicts the initial thought. Wait, but the problem says "Line(L, N)" which could be a side or a diagonal depending on the shape.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is arranged such that L is connected to M and P. Let me try to clarify. Suppose the rectangle has vertices L, M, N, P in order. Then the sides would be LM, MN, NP, and PL. Thus, the diagonals would be LN and MP. So Line(L,N) is a diagonal of the rectangle, which has length 10. However, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. So if LN is a diagonal, then MP is also a diagonal of length 10. But the problem doesn't mention MP directly.

However, there's another line given: Line(L, J). And Line(P, J). So point J is connected to L and to P. Also, since there's a parallelogram LKJM, which includes points L, K, M, J. So J is connected to L and M via the parallelogram. 

Let me consider the parallelogram LKJM. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So LK is parallel and equal to MJ, and LM is parallel and equal to KJ. Also, since it's a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. 

Now, looking at the lines given: Line(L, J) is part of the parallelogram. Since LKJM is a parallelogram, the sides LK and MJ are parallel, and sides LM and KJ are parallel. Also, since LM is a side of the rectangle LMNP, which is connected to L and M. Wait, in the rectangle LMNP, LM is one side, and MN is another. So LM is adjacent to MN. 

So in the parallelogram LKJM, LM is one of the sides. Wait, because the parallelogram is L-K-J-M? Or is it L-K-M-J? Wait, the name is LKJM, so the order is L connected to K, K connected to J, J connected to M, and M connected back to L. So yes, the sides are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. Therefore, LM is a diagonal of the parallelogram? Or is LM a side? Wait, no. In the parallelogram LKJM, the sides are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. So LM is not a side unless the points are ordered differently. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the order of the parallelogram. Maybe the paralle's vertices are L, K, M, J in order, making the sides LK, KM, MJ, and JL. Wait, that would mean the sides are LK, KM, MJ, and JL. But then LM would be a diagonal of the parallelogram. 

This is getting confusing. Let me try to draw this mentally. 

Assuming the rectangle LMNP has sides LM, MN, NP, and PL. Then, the parallelogram LKJM shares points L, M, and J. So, point J is connected to L and M? Or to K and M? 

Alternatively, since the parallelogram is LKJM, then points L, K, J, M form the parallelogram. So, the sides would be LK, KJ, JM, and ML. Therefore, LM is a diagonal of the parallelogram. Wait, but then LM would be a diagonal, not a side. 

But in the rectangle LMNP, LM is a side. So, LM is a side of both the rectangle and a diagonal of the parallelogram? That seems possible. 

Now, the line segments given are Line(L,N), Line(L,J), and Line(P,J). 

Given that LN is a diagonal of the rectangle, which has length 10. Then, Line(L,J) is another segment, whose length is 2x+1. And Line(P,J) is another segment with length 3x-1. 

Also, since Point(P) is a vertex of the rectangle, and Line(P,J) connects P to J. 

Now, considering the parallelogram LKJM, and the fact that J is connected to L and M. Wait, in the parallelogram LKJM, J is connected to K and M. Wait, earlier assumption was that the sides are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. So J is connected to K and M. So, JM is a side of the parallelogram. Therefore, JM is parallel and equal to LK. 

Additionally, since LM is a side of the rectangle, which is also connected to point M. 

Now, considering coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to the points to model this. Let's assume coordinate system where point L is at origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle LMNP, suppose LM is along the x-axis and LP is along the y-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s set L at (0,0). Since LMNP is a rectangle, then M would be at (a,0), N at (a,b), and P at (0,b). Here, a and b are the lengths of the sides. Then, the diagonal LN connects L(0,0) to N(a,b), so its length is sqrt(a² + b²) = 10. Given that LN = 10, so sqrt(a² + b²) = 10. 

Now, the parallelogram LKJM. Points L(0,0), K, M(a,0), and J. Since it's a parallelogram, vectors LM and LK define the parallelogram. Wait, in a parallelogram, the vector from L to K plus the vector from L to M gives the vector from L to J? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. 

Alternatively, since LKJM is a parallelogram, then the midpoint of the diagonals must coincide. The diagonals are LKJM's diagonals: LJ and KM. So, the midpoint of LJ should be same as midpoint of KM. 

But maybe it's easier to use vectors. Let me think. Let me assign coordinates to point J. Since in the parallelogram LKJM, the position of J depends on the position of K. Let me assume that K is some point, say (c,d), then since LKJM is a parallelogram, vector LK equals vector MJ. Vector LK is (c - 0, d - 0) = (c, d). Vector MJ is (J_x - a, J_y - 0). So, setting these equal: J_x - a = c → J_x = a + c; J_y = d. 

Similarly, vector LM equals vector KJ. Vector LM is (a - 0, 0 - 0) = (a, 0). Vector KJ is (J_x - c, J_y - d). So, equating components: J_x - c = a → J_x = c + a; J_y - d = 0 → J_y = d. Which matches the previous result. So, J has coordinates (a + c, d). 

Therefore, the coordinates of J depend on the coordinates of K. But without more info about K, it's hard to proceed. However, we do have the line segments Line(L,J) and Line(P,J). 

Line(L,J): connects L(0,0) to J(a + c, d). Its length is sqrt[(a + c)^2 + d^2] = 2x + 1. 

Line(P,J): connects P(0,b) to J(a + c, d). Its length is sqrt[(a + c - 0)^2 + (d - b)^2] = 3x - 1. 

Additionally, since LN is the diagonal of the rectangle, which has length sqrt(a² + b²) = 10. 

But we need to find x. How can we relate these equations? 

We have two equations involving sqrt terms. Let me square them to eliminate square roots. 

First equation (from LJ):

(a + c)^2 + d^2 = (2x + 1)^2. 

Second equation (from PJ):

(a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (3x - 1)^2. 

Also, from the rectangle's diagonal: a² + b² = 10² = 100. 

But we have variables a, b, c, d, x. Need more relations. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram LKJM, what else can we deduce? 

In the parallelogram LKJM, the sides LK and JM are equal and parallel. Vector LK is (c, d), vector JM is (a + c - a, d - b) = (c, d - b). Wait, no. Wait, J is (a + c, d), and M is (a, 0). So vector JM is (a + c - a, d - 0) = (c, d). Which is same as vector LK (which is (c, d)). Therefore, vector JM equals vector LK, which is consistent with being a parallelogram. 

Additionally, vector LM is (a, 0), and vector KJ is (a + c - c, d - d) = (a, 0), which matches. So that checks out. 

So, in this setup, we have the coordinates of J as (a + c, d). 

But how does this help us? We need another relation to link variables. Perhaps the fact that in the parallelogram, the sides are related to the rectangle? Or maybe there's something else. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram LKJM, the sides are LK and LM? No, in the parallelogram, sides are LK and KJ. Wait, earlier we saw that vector LK is (c, d) and vector KJ is (a, 0). Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent sides should be vectors that are not necessarily orthogonal. So, in the parallelogram, the sides LK and LM are adjacent? Wait, no. The sides of the parallelogram are LK and LKJM's adjacent sides. Wait, in the parallelogram LKJM, starting from L, the sides are LK and LM? No, because the points are L, K, J, M. So from L, the sides are LK and LM? Wait, no. From point L, it connects to K and to M? Because the parallelogram is L-K-J-M-L. So from L, the edges are LK and LM. Wait, but in our coordinate system, L is (0,0), K is (c, d), and M is (a, 0). So LM is from L(0,0) to M(a, 0), which is horizontal. And LK is from L(0,0) to K(c, d). 

So, in the parallelogram, sides LK and LM are adjacent sides. Hence, their lengths are |LK| and |LM|. 

But |LM| is the length from L(0,0) to M(a, 0), which is 'a'. Similarly, |LK| is sqrt(c² + d²). 

But since LKJM is a parallelogram, the sides LK and LM are not necessarily perpendicular. 

But how does this relate to the other given lines? 

Well, we have the lines Line(L,J) and Line(P,J). 

From before, we had expressions for the lengths of those lines. 

But we also know that in the rectangle, the sides are LM = a, MN = b, NP = a, and PL = b. So the sides of the rectangle are a and b, with a² + b² = 100. 

But we still don't have enough equations. Let me see. Are there other constraints? 

Wait, the line PJ connects P(0,b) to J(a + c, d). The length of this line is 3x - 1. 

But we also have the line LJ connecting L(0,0) to J(a + c, d), which has length 2x + 1. 

Let me write down the equations again:

Equation 1: (a + c)^2 + d^2 = (2x + 1)^2.

Equation 2: (a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (3x - 1)^2.

And Equation 3: a² + b² = 100.

But we need more equations. Let me think about the parallelogram. 

Since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from L to K (which is (c, d)) and the vector from L to M (which is (a, 0)) are adjacent sides. So the area of the parallelogram would be the magnitude of the cross product of vectors LK and LM, which is |c*0 - d*a| = | -ad | = |ad|. 

But I don't know if that helps. Unless there's another condition. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the sides of the parallelogram and the rectangle. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about areas or angles, except for the lengths given. 

Another idea: Maybe the line PJ relates to the rectangle's structure. Since P is a corner of the rectangle, and J is a point connected to P. 

Alternatively, since we have two equations involving (a + c)^2 and d^2, and (d - b)^2, maybe subtract them to eliminate (a + c)^2. 

Subtract Equation 2 minus Equation 1:

[ (a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2 ] - [ (a + c)^2 + d^2 ] = (3x - 1)^2 - (2x + 1)^2.

Simplify left side:

(a + c)^2 cancels out. Remaining is (d - b)^2 - d^2 = expand: d² - 2bd + b² - d² = -2bd + b² = b(b - 2d).

Right side: Expand both squares:

(3x -1)^2 = 9x² -6x +1

(2x +1)^2 = 4x² +4x +1

Difference: 9x² -6x +1 -4x² -4x -1 = 5x² -10x

Thus:

b(b - 2d) = 5x² -10x.

Hmm, not sure yet. 

But we also have Equation 3: a² + b² = 100. 

Is there another way to express b? Maybe from the parallelogram? 

Alternatively, since in the parallelogram LKJM, the coordinates of J are (a + c, d), and we might need to relate this to other parts. 

Alternatively, think about the line PJ. The coordinates of P are (0, b), and J is (a + c, d). So the vector from P to J is (a + c - 0, d - b) = (a + c, d - b). The length squared is (a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2, which is Equation 2. 

But maybe we can find another expression for (a + c)^2. 

Looking at Equation 1: (a + c)^2 = (2x +1)^2 - d^2.

Plug that into Equation 2:

[(2x +1)^2 - d^2] + (d - b)^2 = (3x -1)^2.

Which expands to:

(2x +1)^2 - d^2 + d² - 2bd + b² = (3x -1)^2.

Simplifying:

(2x +1)^2 - 2bd + b² = (3x -1)^2.

Then, rearranged:

(2x +1)^2 - (3x -1)^2 = 2bd - b².

Compute left side:

Expand (2x+1)^2 = 4x² +4x +1.

Expand (3x-1)^2 = 9x² -6x +1.

Subtract: (4x² +4x +1) - (9x² -6x +1) = -5x² +10x.

So:

-5x² +10x = 2bd - b².

Rearranged:

b² - 2bd = -5x² +10x.

Or:

b(b - 2d) = -5x² +10x.

Earlier, from subtracting equations, we had b(b - 2d) = 5x² -10x. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, earlier subtraction gave:

Left side was b(b - 2d) = 5x² -10x. But now, this derivation shows that b(b - 2d) = -5x² +10x. There's a sign discrepancy. Let me check my steps again.

When I subtracted Equation 2 - Equation 1, I got:

Left side: b(b - 2d) ?

Wait, let me re-examine the subtraction step.

Original Equations:

Equation 2: (a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (3x -1)^2.

Equation 1: (a + c)^2 + d^2 = (2x +1)^2.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Left side becomes [(a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2] - [(a + c)^2 + d^2] = (d - b)^2 - d^2 = d² - 2bd + b² - d² = b² - 2bd.

Right side: (3x-1)^2 - (2x +1)^2 = 9x² -6x +1 - (4x² +4x +1) = 5x² -10x.

So, b² - 2bd = 5x² -10x.

But in the later derivation, after expanding, I found:

From substituting, I ended up with:

b² - 2bd = -5x² +10x.

That suggests that there's an error in that second derivation. Let me check that again.

After substitution:

Equation became:

(2x +1)^2 - 2bd + b² = (3x -1)^2.

So moving terms:

(2x +1)^2 - (3x -1)^2 = 2bd - b².

Which is:

Left side: -5x² +10x.

So:

-5x² +10x = 2bd - b² → rearranged as:

b² - 2bd = 5x² -10x.

Which matches the earlier result. So that was a miscalculation earlier. 

So, combining both results, we have:

From subtraction of equations, we get:

b² - 2bd = 5x² -10x. 

But we also have Equation 3: a² + b² = 100.

But we need another equation to relate these variables. 

Perhaps we can find another relation involving a and b. 

Let me think. Is there a relation between a and c or d? 

In the parallelogram LKJM, the coordinates of K are (c, d). But how is K defined? It's just a point such that LKJM is a parallelogram. Without more information, it's hard to tell. However, maybe there's another constraint from the rectangle? 

Wait, since LM is a side of the rectangle, which is from (0,0) to (a,0), and LM is also one side of the parallelogram. 

But in the parallelogram LKJM, LM is a side. Wait, no. Earlier, we considered that in the parallelogram, sides are LK and LM? Or LK and LKJM's adjacent sides. 

Actually, in the parallelogram LKJM, the sides are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. So LM is a diagonal of the parallelogram, not a side. 

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that vector LM is (a, 0), and vector KJ is (a, 0). So, in the parallelogram, LM is equal to KJ. 

But LM is a side of the rectangle, which is length a. So, KJ is also length a. 

Vector KJ is from K(c, d) to J(a + c, d), which is (a, 0), so its length is a. So, that's consistent. 

So, the length of KJ is a, which is the same as LM. 

But how does this help us? 

Maybe we can find another equation involving a, b, d, and c. 

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of J as (a + c, d), and we know that in the rectangle, point N is (a, b). So, the line PN connects P(0, b) to N(a, b)? Wait, no. Wait, in the rectangle, the points are L(0,0), M(a,0), N(a,b), P(0,b). So line PN would be from P(0,b) to N(a,b), which is horizontal. But the given line is PJ, which goes from P(0,b) to J(a + c, d). 

Not sure. 

But maybe there's a way to express c and d in terms of other variables. 

Alternatively, since we have the line LJ which connects L(0,0) to J(a + c, d), and its length is 2x + 1. Also, the line PJ connects P(0,b) to J(a + c, d), with length 3x -1. 

Let me consider the difference between these two lines. 

The vector from L to J is (a + c, d), and the vector from P to J is (a + c, d - b). 

So, the vector from L to J is (a + c, d), and the vector from P to J is (a + c, d - b). 

These vectors are related, but I'm not seeing an immediate connection. 

But maybe if we consider the coordinates of J, since it's part of both the parallelogram and the rectangle. 

Wait, but without knowing the exact position of K, we can't determine c and d. This seems like a dead end. 

Alternative approach: Assume that the parallelogram LKJM is a rhombus? No, the problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, since the rectangle's diagonal is LN = 10, and we have expressions involving x. Maybe there's a way to express a and b in terms of x? 

But we have too many variables. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to express (a + c)^2 from Equation 1 and plug into Equation 2. 

From Equation 1:

(a + c)^2 = (2x +1)^2 - d^2.

From Equation 2:

(a + c)^2 = (3x -1)^2 - (d - b)^2.

Setting these equal:

(2x +1)^2 - d^2 = (3x -1)^2 - (d - b)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left: 4x² +4x +1 - d².

Right: 9x² -6x +1 - (d² - 2bd + b²) = 9x² -6x +1 -d² + 2bd - b².

Set equal:

4x² +4x +1 - d² = 9x² -6x +1 -d² + 2bd - b².

Cancel out -d² and +1 from both sides:

4x² +4x = 9x² -6x + 2bd - b².

Rearrange:

0 = 5x² -10x + 2bd - b².

Which is the same as earlier: 5x² -10x = b² - 2bd.

But we also have from Equation 3: a² + b² = 100.

But we still have two variables a and b, and others. 

Unless there's another relation involving a and b. 

Wait, in the rectangle, the sides are a and b, and the diagonal is 10. So a² + b² = 100. 

But how can we relate this to the other equation? 

If we can express b² - 2bd in terms of a and b, but we don't know d. 

Wait, maybe from the parallelogram? 

In the parallelogram LKJM, the sides LK and LM are vectors (c, d) and (a, 0). The length of LK is sqrt(c² + d²), and the length of LM is a. 

But I don't see how this helps. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram, the length of LK is sqrt(c² + d²), and the length of LM is a. These are adjacent sides of the parallelogram, but no further info is given about them. 

Is there any other given information about the lengths? 

No, the only given lengths are LN=10, LJ=2x+1, PJ=3x-1. 

So, unless there's a missing piece, we might need to assume that there's a relation between a and d or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the line PJ is perpendicular to something? Or maybe there's a right triangle involved. 

Wait, if we look at the coordinates of J(a + c, d) and P(0, b), then the vector PJ is (a + c, d - b). If this vector is perpendicular to something... Not sure. 

Alternatively, if there's a right angle somewhere, but the problem doesn't specify that. 

Wait, but maybe the line LJ and PJ form a right angle? Not stated. 

This seems stuck. Let me think of another approach. 

Suppose we treat this algebraically. We have:

From above, we have:

b² - 2bd = 5x² -10x.

And we also have a² + b² = 100.

But we need another equation involving b and d. 

Wait, from the parallelogram, since vector LK is (c, d), and vector LM is (a, 0), the dot product between LK and LM would be c*a + d*0 = ac. If the parallelogram has some property, like being a rectangle, but it's only specified as a parallelogram. 

But since it's a general parallelogram, we can't assume orthogonality. So no help there. 

Wait, but maybe we can express c in terms of other variables? 

From the coordinates of J, which is (a + c, d). But we don't have any direct info on c or d. 

Alternatively, if we consider that in the parallelogram, the length of LK is sqrt(c² + d²), and since LK is a side of the parallelogram, but we don't know its length. 

Unless there's a relation between LK and other sides? 

No, the problem doesn't give any info about the sides of the parallelogram. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between the lengths of LJ and PJ? 

LJ is 2x +1, PJ is 3x -1. Let me compute their sum or difference. 

But without knowing the relation between them, it's unclear. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to express (a + c)^2 + d^2 = (2x +1)^2 and (a + c)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (3x -1)^2. 

Let me call (a + c)^2 as S, d^2 as T, and (d - b)^2 as U. 

So:

S + T = (2x +1)^2 --> eq1

S + U = (3x -1)^2 --> eq2

Subtracting eq1 from eq2 gives U - T = (3x -1)^2 - (2x +1)^2 = 5x² -10x, as before. 

But U = (d - b)^2 and T = d^2, so U - T = -2bd + b² = 5x² -10x. 

So, b² - 2bd = 5x² -10x. 

But from the rectangle's diagonal: a² + b² = 100. 

So, if we can find another equation involving b and d, we can solve. 

But how? 

Wait, what if we consider that in the parallelogram, the length of LK is sqrt(c² + d²), and the length of LM is a. But without knowing anything about the parallelogram's sides, we can't relate them. 

But perhaps there's a relation between the vectors LK and LM? Like, if the parallelogram has some specific property? 

No, the problem only states it's a parallelogram, so no additional info. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me think differently. 

Maybe there's a mistake in assuming that LN is a diagonal? What if LN is a side of the rectangle instead? 

Let me reconsider the rectangle LMNP. If LN is a side, then the rectangle would have sides LM, MN, NP, and PL. If LN is a side, then N would be adjacent to L. So, the rectangle would have vertices in order L-M-N-P-L? Wait, that would make MN and NP adjacent sides. But then LN would be a diagonal from L to N, which is not a side. 

Wait, unless the rectangle is labeled differently. Maybe it's L-M-P-N-L? So the sides are LM, MP, PN, NL. Then, LN would be a diagonal. 

But regardless, LN is a diagonal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is L-M-N-P with sides LM and LP being adjacent. Then, LN would be a diagonal. 

So, going back, the main issue is that we have too many variables and not enough equations. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to assume that the parallelogram is a rhombus? But the problem doesn't say that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the lengths of LJ and PJ through the rectangle's properties. 

For instance, if we consider triangle LPJ, but we don't know if it's a right triangle. 

Wait, if we consider points L(0,0), P(0,b), and J(a + c, d). Then, LP is vertical from (0,0) to (0,b), and LJ is from (0,0) to (a + c, d), and PJ is from (0,b) to (a + c, d). 

Maybe applying the Pythagorean theorem in some triangle? 

But without knowing if any angles are right angles, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but if we consider the coordinates, the distance from L to P is b, and from P to J is 3x -1, and from L to J is 2x +1. 

So, in triangle LPJ, we have sides LP = b, PJ = 3x -1, and LJ = 2x +1. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle LPJ: 

(2x +1)^2 = b^2 + (3x -1)^2 - 2*b*(3x -1)*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at P. 

But without knowing theta, this isn't helpful. 

But maybe there's a relationship between b and x? 

Alternatively, if we assume that angle at P is 90 degrees, making it a right triangle. But why would that be true? The problem doesn't state that. 

But maybe it's implied by the rectangle? For example, if PJ is perpendicular to LP? 

LP is vertical (since L is (0,0) and P is (0,b)), so if PJ is horizontal, then it would be perpendicular. But PJ goes from P(0,b) to J(a + c, d). For this to be horizontal, d must equal b, making J have y-coordinate b. 

If d = b, then the y-coordinate of J is b, so the line PJ would be horizontal. 

Let me explore this possibility. 

Assume that d = b. Then, the y-coordinate of J is b, so point J is (a + c, b). 

Then, the length of LJ is sqrt[(a + c)^2 + (b - 0)^2] = sqrt((a + c)^2 + b²) = 2x +1. 

Also, the length of PJ is sqrt[(a + c)^2 + (b - b)^2] = sqrt((a + c)^2) = |a + c|. Since lengths are positive, it's a + c = 3x -1. 

So, we now have two equations:

1. (a + c)^2 + b² = (2x +1)^2.

2. a + c = 3x -1.

Also, from the rectangle's diagonal: a² + b² = 100.

Let me substitute a + c = 3x -1 into equation 1:

(3x -1)^2 + b² = (2x +1)^2.

Expand both sides:

Left: 9x² -6x +1 + b².

Right: 4x² +4x +1.

Subtracting right from left:

9x² -6x +1 + b² -4x² -4x -1 = 5x² -10x + b² = 0.

So:

5x² -10x + b² = 0.

But from the rectangle, we have a² + b² = 100 → b² = 100 - a².

Substitute into above:

5x² -10x + (100 - a²) = 0.

But we also have a + c = 3x -1, but we don't know c. However, from the parallelogram, we might relate a and c. 

Wait, in the parallelogram LKJM, vector LK is (c, d) = (c, b), since we assumed d = b. And vector LM is (a, 0). 

In the parallelogram, the sides LK and LM are adjacent sides. The length of LK is sqrt(c² + b²), and length of LM is a. 

But we don't have info about these lengths. However, in the parallelogram, the diagonals are LJ and KM. 

Wait, the diagonal LJ has length 2x +1, which we've already used. 

But the other diagonal is KM. Point K is (c, b), and point M is (a, 0). So vector KM is (a - c, -b). The length of diagonal KM is sqrt[(a - c)^2 + b²]. 

But in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. 

Formula: In any parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. 

So, if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. 

Wait, but in this case, the sides of the parallelogram are LK and LM. Their lengths are sqrt(c² + b²) and a. 

So, the formula would be: (diagonal1)^2 + (diagonal2)^2 = 2[(sqrt(c² + b²))^2 + a²] = 2[c² + b² + a²].

But diagonal1 is LJ, which has length 2x +1, so (2x +1)^2. Diagonal2 is KM, which has length sqrt[(a - c)^2 + b²], so its square is (a - c)^2 + b². 

Thus:

(2x +1)^2 + [(a - c)^2 + b²] = 2[a² + c² + b²].

Simplify:

Expand left side: (4x² +4x +1) + a² - 2ac + c² + b².

Right side: 2a² + 2c² + 2b².

Set equal:

4x² +4x +1 + a² - 2ac + c² + b² = 2a² + 2c² + 2b².

Bring all terms to left:

4x² +4x +1 + a² - 2ac + c² + b² - 2a² - 2c² - 2b² = 0.

Simplify:

4x² +4x +1 - a² - c² - b² - 2ac = 0.

But from the rectangle, we know a² + b² = 100. So replace a² + b² with 100:

4x² +4x +1 - 100 - c² - 2ac = 0.

Rearranged:

4x² +4x +1 -100 = c² + 2ac.

So:

4x² +4x -99 = c² + 2ac.

But we also have from earlier: a + c = 3x -1 → c = 3x -1 - a.

Substituting c = 3x -1 - a into the equation:

4x² +4x -99 = (3x -1 -a)^2 + 2a(3x -1 -a).

Expand (3x -1 -a)^2 = (3x -1)^2 - 2a(3x -1) + a².

And 2a(3x -1 -a) = 6ax -2a -2a².

So total:

(3x -1)^2 - 2a(3x -1) + a² + 6ax -2a -2a².

Combine terms:

(9x² -6x +1) -6ax +2a + a² +6ax -2a -2a².

Simplify:

9x² -6x +1 + (-6ax +6ax) + (2a -2a) + (a² -2a²).

Which simplifies to:

9x² -6x +1 - a².

So the entire equation becomes:

4x² +4x -99 = 9x² -6x +1 - a².

Rearranging:

4x² +4x -99 -9x² +6x -1 + a² = 0 → -5x² +10x -100 + a² = 0 → a² = 5x² -10x +100.

But from the rectangle, a² + b² = 100 → a² = 100 - b². So:

100 - b² = 5x² -10x +100 → -b² = 5x² -10x → b² = -5x² +10x.

But b² must be non-negative, so -5x² +10x ≥ 0 → 5x(2 - x) ≥ 0 → x ∈ [0, 2]. 

But x is likely a positive integer, given the answer choices are integers from 2 to 10. So possible x values are 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. But answer choices start from 2, so x=2 is possible. 

But also, from earlier, we had from the equation 5x² -10x + b² = 0. Substituting b² = -5x² +10x:

5x² -10x + (-5x² +10x) = 0 → 0 = 0. So this is consistent. 

But this doesn't give us new information. 

So, we have b² = -5x² +10x. 

But also, from the earlier equation when we assumed d = b, we had:

From the equation 5x² -10x + b² = 0 → b² = -5x² +10x. 

Which is the same as above. 

But we also have from the rectangle: a² + b² = 100. And from above, a² = 5x² -10x +100. 

Wait, no: earlier, we had a² = 5x² -10x +100? Let me check:

Wait, from earlier:

a² = 5x² -10x +100?

No, let me retrace. We had:

From the equation after substituting everything, we arrived at a² = 5x² -10x +100?

Wait, no. Let me go back. 

We had:

From the equation after expanding, we had:

-5x² +10x -100 + a² = 0 → a² = 5x² -10x +100. 

Yes. 

But also, from the rectangle: a² + b² = 100 → a² = 100 - b². 

So, combining:

100 - b² = 5x² -10x +100 → -b² = 5x² -10x → b² = -5x² +10x. 

So, this implies that b² = -5x² +10x. 

But since b² ≥ 0, we have -5x² +10x ≥ 0 → 5x(2 - x) ≥ 0 → x ∈ [0, 2]. 

Since x is a positive number (as lengths are positive), and answer choices are A.2, B.4, C.5, D.10, the only possible x in this range is x=2. 

So x=2 is the only possible value. 

Let me verify this. 

If x=2, then b²
