Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 3, which I assume refers to a specific angle in the diagram described by the given predicates. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, there's a Rectangle(T,X,Y,Z,W). Wait, rectangles have four sides, but here they mention five points? That seems odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me check the predicates again. Oh, the Rectangle predicate lists T, X, Y, Z, W as points. But a rectangle has four vertices, so perhaps it's a misstatement, or maybe it's a different shape? Or maybe the points are arranged such that T, X, Y, Z, W form some structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a pentagon, but the other predicates talk about lines connecting them. Let me look at the lines mentioned.

The lines given are Line(T,Y), Line(Y,X), Line(X,Z), Line(Z,W), Line(W,T), Line(T,Z), Line(W,Y). Hmm. So starting from T connected to Y, then Y to X, X to Z, Z to W, W back to T. Then also T to Z and W to Y. This seems like a more complex figure than a simple rectangle. Maybe it's a combination of shapes?

Wait, the RightAngle predicates indicate that each corner has a right angle. For example, Angle(T,X,Y) is a right angle, Angle(X,Y,Z), etc. So if we consider the points T, X, Y, Z, W forming a polygon where each consecutive pair forms a right angle. Wait, but with five points, how does that work? Let me visualize this.

Let me list the points and connections:

Points: T, X, Y, Z, W.

Lines:

T-Y, Y-X, X-Z, Z-W, W-T, T-Z, W-Y.

So, starting from T connected to Y and Z. Y connected to T and X. X connected to Y and Z. Z connected to X and W. W connected to Z and T. Also, W connected to Y. 

This seems like a star-shaped figure or maybe overlapping lines. However, the RightAngles are specified for Angles(T,X,Y), which would be the angle at point X between T and Y? Wait, the angle notation is confusing. The RightAngle(Angle(T,X,Y)) means the angle at point X formed by points T, X, Y. Similarly for others.

So, looking at the right angles:

Angle(T,X,Y): right angle at X between T and Y.

Angle(X,Y,Z): right angle at Y between X and Z.

Angle(Y,Z,W): right angle at Z between Y and W.

Angle(Z,W,T): right angle at W between Z and T.

So these four right angles suggest that the figure is made up of four right angles, but since there are five points, maybe it's a rectangle with an extra point? Or perhaps a three-dimensional shape? Wait, but all points are in a plane, probably.

Alternatively, considering that there's a line T-Z and W-Y intersecting at point Z? Wait, the IntersectAt predicate says Line(T,Z) intersects Line(W,Y) at Point Z. Wait, but if both lines pass through Z, then they meet at Z. So Line(T,Z) goes from T to Z, and Line(W,Y) goes from W to Y, and they intersect at Z. Therefore, point Z is the intersection point of those two lines. That suggests that lines T-Z and W-Y cross at Z. So Z is a common point.

Now, the lengths given:

Length of Line(T,Y) is 1, Length of Line(W,X) is 2, Length of Line(X,Z) is 3, Length of Line(Z,W) is 4.

Also, MeasureOf(Angle(T,Y,X)) is 52 degrees. So angle at Y between T and X is 52 degrees. Wait, angle(T,Y,X) is the angle at Y between T and X. So that's angle at Y, with segments YT and YX. Since there's a right angle at Y (from Angle(X,Y,Z)), which is the angle between X-Y and Y-Z. So angle at Y between X and Z is 90 degrees. So angle(T,Y,X) is part of that?

Wait, the angle T,Y,X is at Y, formed by points T, Y, X. So TY and YX. Since there's a right angle at Y between X and Z (as per Angle(X,Y,Z)), then the angle between YX and YZ is 90 degrees. So if angle(T,Y,X) is 52 degrees, that would mean that the angle between TY and YX is 52 degrees. So that angle is adjacent to the right angle at Y. So the total angle around Y would be 52 + 90 = 142 degrees? But wait, in a plane, the sum of angles around a point should be 360 degrees. Wait, but unless there are other lines at Y.

But according to the given data, the lines at Y are Y connected to T, Y connected to X, and Y connected to W via Line(W,Y). Because Line(W,Y) exists. So at point Y, there are lines going to T, X, and W. Therefore, the angles at Y would involve these three lines. So angle between T-Y and Y-X is 52 degrees, angle between Y-X and Y-Z is 90 degrees (right angle), and angle between Y-Z and Y-W? Not sure yet. But since there's a bisector mentioned: BisectsAngle(Line(T,Z), Angle(T,W,Z)). And BisectsAngle(Line(W,Y), Angle(T,W,Z)).

So Angle(T,W,Z) is being bisected by both Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y)? Wait, that seems conflicting unless they are the same line. Wait, the bisectors are Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) bisecting the same angle? Which would imply that those lines are the angle bisectors of Angle(T,W,Z).

So, Angle(T,W,Z) is at point Z, between points T, W, and Z. So that angle is formed by lines ZT and ZW. So the angle at Z between T and W. Now, the bisectors of that angle are Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y). Wait, that can't be because Line(T,Z) is one side of the angle. Unless the angle is split into two parts by another line. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the bisectsAngle predicate.

The BisectsAngle(Line(T,Z), Angle(T,W,Z)) means that Line(T,Z) bisects the angle at Z between T and W. But Line(T,Z) is just the side of the angle itself, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, unless there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point W? No, the angle is Angle(T,W,Z), which is at point W? No, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(T,W,Z) is the angle at point W between points T, W, Z. Wait, that changes things. So the angle is at W between T and Z. So that angle is formed by lines WT and WZ. Then, Line(T,Z) is supposed to bisect that angle. Wait, but Line(T,Z) connects T to Z, so it's a line from T to Z. How would that bisect the angle at W?

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion in the angle notation. Let me re-express:

Angle(T,W,Z) is the angle at point W between points T and Z. So the angle is at W, with segments WT and WZ. Therefore, the bisector of that angle would be a line starting at W and splitting the angle into two equal parts. But the bisector is said to be Line(T,Z). Wait, Line(T,Z) starts at T and ends at Z. So that line passes through W? Because the bisector needs to start at the vertex of the angle, which is W. So there's a contradiction here. Unless Line(T,Z) passes through W. But according to the IntersectAt predicate, Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. So Line(T,Z) goes from T to Z, and Line(W,Y) goes from W to Y, intersecting at Z. Therefore, Line(T,Z) ends at Z, so it doesn't pass through W. Hence, Line(T,Z) cannot be the bisector of angle at W. There's something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps there was a misinterpretation of the angle. Let me check the original predicates again. The BisectsAngle(Line(T,Z), Angle(T,W,Z)) â€“ so the angle is Angle(T,W,Z), which is at W. The bisector is Line(T,Z), which is a line from T to Z. How can that line bisect the angle at W? It would need to start at W and go into the angle. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Maybe there's a typo in the angle notation? Like perhaps it's Angle(T,Z,W) instead of Angle(T,W,Z)? Let me think.

Assuming that the angle is actually at Z, then Angle(T,Z,W) would be the angle at Z between T and W. In that case, the bisector would be a line starting at Z. But the bisector is Line(T,Z), which starts at T. Still not matching. Alternatively, maybe the angle is at T? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is at Z, and the bisector is Line(W,Y). But the predicate says BisectsAngle(Line(T,Z), Angle(T,W,Z)) and BisectsAngle(Line(W,Y), Angle(T,W,Z)). So both lines are bisecting the same angle. That implies that both Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) are angle bisectors of Angle(T,W,Z). Which would require that both lines lie along the bisector. Hence, Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) must coincide. But according to the IntersectAt predicate, they intersect at Z. So unless they are the same line, but that's impossible unless they overlap entirely. 

Hmm, this seems contradictory. Perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me try to draw this mentally.

We have points T, X, Y, Z, W. Lines connecting them as follows:

- T-Y, Y-X, X-Z, Z-W, W-T, T-Z, W-Y.

So, from T to Y, Y to X, X to Z, Z to W, W to T. Also, T to Z and W to Y. 

At point Z, there's a connection to X and W, and also T via T-Z. At point Y, there's a connection to T, X, and W (since W-Y is a line). 

Now, the angle in question is Angle(T,W,Z). Assuming that's the angle at W between T and Z. So, lines WT and WZ. To bisect this angle, there should be a line from W that splits it into two equal angles. According to the predicate, Line(T,Z) bisects this angle. But Line(T,Z) starts at T and ends at Z. So unless this line passes through W, it can't be the bisector. However, the IntersectAt says that Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. So Line(T,Z) ends at Z, and Line(W,Y) passes through Z. So Line(W,Y) starts at W, goes through Z, and ends at Y. Therefore, Line(W,Y) passes through Z. Thus, Line(W,Y) is the line from W to Y passing through Z. Therefore, Line(W,Y) includes point Z. 

Therefore, Line(W,Y) passes through Z, so it's the line extending from W through Z to Y. Similarly, Line(T,Z) is from T to Z. So if the angle at W between T and Z is being bisected by Line(T,Z), which is a line from T to Z, but that line starts at T and ends at Z. How does it relate to the angle at W?

Wait, maybe the angle is at Z? Let me double-check the angle notation. If it's Angle(T,W,Z), then the vertex is W, with segments WT and WZ. So the angle is at W between T and Z. The bisector would be a line from W that splits this angle. However, the bisector is stated as Line(T,Z), which is a line from T to Z. This line doesn't start at W, so it can't be the bisector. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that either the angle notation is incorrect or there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at Z, and the bisector is Line(W,Y). Let me see: if the angle is Angle(T,Z,W), which is at Z between T and W. Then, the bisector would be a line starting at Z. The bisector is Line(T,Z) or Line(W,Y)? Wait, the predicate says BisectsAngle(Line(T,Z), Angle(T,W,Z)) â€“ so the bisector is Line(T,Z), which is a line from T to Z. Again, not starting at the angle vertex.

This seems very confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the angle. Let me try to consider that the angle is at Z, between W and T. So Angle(W,Z,T). Then, the bisector would be a line from Z that splits that angle. But the bisector is Line(W,Y), which starts at W and goes through Z. So if Line(W,Y) is the bisector, then it would split the angle at Z. But how does that fit with the rest?

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at Y. Wait, the measure of Angle(W,Y,Z) is 38 degrees. So Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between W and Z. Given that there's a right angle at Y between X and Z (Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle), and the measure of Angle(W,Y,Z) is 38 degrees. So at point Y, we have several lines: Y connected to T, Y connected to X, and Y connected to W. So the angles at Y would be:

- Between T-Y and Y-X: 52 degrees (given).
- Between Y-X and Y-Z: 90 degrees (right angle).
- Between Y-Z and Y-W: ?

Since the sum of angles around point Y should be 360 degrees, but since it's a planar figure, the angles around Y would add up to 360. Wait, but in reality, if there are three lines emanating from Y, they divide the plane into three angles. Wait, but if there are three lines from Y, they could form three angles adding up to 360 degrees. However, the given angles are 52 degrees (between T-Y and Y-X), 90 degrees (between Y-X and Y-Z), and the remaining angle between Y-Z and Y-W. Let me calculate that missing angle.

Total angles around Y: 52 + 90 + angle(W,Y,Z) = 52 + 90 + 38 = 180. Wait, but that sums to 180, which would mean the third angle is 38 degrees. But that would imply that the three lines from Y form angles that sum to 180 degrees, which is possible if they are arranged in a straight line? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the angles are not all on one side. Wait, in a plane, if there are three lines from a single point, the sum of the angles between them depends on the configuration. But typically, if there are three rays from a point, they divide the plane into three angles whose measures add up to 360 degrees. However, here, if we have three angles: 52, 90, and 38, that adds to 52+90+38=180. So that leaves 180 degrees unaccounted for. That suggests that perhaps there's another angle or that the lines are arranged differently.

Wait, maybe the angle between Y-Z and Y-W is 38 degrees, as given by MeasureOf(Angle(W,Y,Z), 38). So that angle is 38 degrees. So the sum of the angles at Y would be 52 + 90 + 38 = 180 degrees. That suggests that the three lines from Y are forming a straight line, which isn't possible unless some lines are colinear. But given that Y is connected to X, Z, and W, and there's a right angle between X and Z, and the other angles... This seems inconsistent. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at Y are not all adjacent. For instance, if the lines Y-T, Y-X, Y-Z, and Y-W are arranged such that some are on opposite sides. But without a diagram, it's hard to tell. However, the given measures are 52 and 38, which add up to 90. Wait, 52 + 38 = 90. So if there's a right angle at Y between X and Z, then maybe those two angles (52 and 38) plus the right angle make up the full 180 degrees? Wait, 52 + 38 + 90 = 180. Yes! So that suggests that the angle between Y-T and Y-X is 52 degrees, the angle between Y-X and Y-Z is 90 degrees, and the angle between Y-Z and Y-W is 38 degrees. These three angles add up to 52 + 90 + 38 = 180 degrees. Therefore, the lines Y-T, Y-X, Y-Z, and Y-W are arranged in such a way that they form a straight line? No, because they're coming from the same point Y. Wait, but if those three angles add to 180, then the lines Y-T, Y-X, Y-Z, and Y-W are arranged such that they form a straight line? No, that's not possible with four lines. Wait, there are three angles between the lines. If the three angles are between Y-T & Y-X (52Â°), Y-X & Y-Z (90Â°), and Y-Z & Y-W (38Â°), then those three angles add to 180Â°, implying that the lines Y-T and Y-W are in a straight line? Because the total rotation from Y-T to Y-W would be 52 + 90 + 38 = 180Â°, making them colinear. So that would mean that Y-T and Y-W are in a straight line, i.e., collinear. But that contradicts the presence of other lines. However, given the predicates, this might be the case.

If Y-T and Y-W are colinear, then the line TW would pass through Y. But earlier, there's a line W-Y, which connects W to Y. So if Y-T and Y-W are colinear, then line TW passes through Y. But according to the given lines, there is a line from W to T (line W-T). So if Y lies on line TW, then the line TW passes through Y. 

This suggests that the points T, Y, W are colinear. But how does that fit with the rest of the figure? Let me try to reconstruct:

- Points T, X, Y, Z, W.
- Line T-Y, Y-X, X-Z, Z-W, W-T, T-Z, W-Y.
- If Y is on line TW, then line TW goes through Y. So T-Y-W are colinear. 
- Also, line W-Y is the same as line W-Y, which is part of line TW.
- Additionally, there's a line from Y to X, and from X to Z, and from Z to W.
- So, if T-Y-W are colinear, then the line from Z to W connects to W, and from X to Z. 

Now, regarding the right angles: Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle, so at point Y, between X and Z. If Y is on line TW, then the line Y-X and Y-Z form a right angle. Let me imagine this: Y is on TW, with T-Y-W. From Y, there's a line to X, forming a right angle with Y-Z. So X is perpendicular to Y-Z. 

Additionally, there's a line from Z to W. Given that Z-W is length 4, and X-Z is length 3. Also, Line(X,Z) has length 3. 

Given that, maybe we can use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the points to better understand the relationships.

Let me place point Y at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since T-Y-W are colinear, and assuming that line TW passes through Y. Let me set coordinates:

- Let Y be at (0, 0).
- Since T-Y is length 1 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(T,Y)), 1)), so if Y is at (0,0), then T could be at (-1, 0), since the distance from T to Y is 1. Then, W would be along the same line, say at (a, 0), but since W-Y is a line, and the length from W to X is 2. Wait, but we don't know the position of W yet.

But we also have the right angle at Y between X and Z. So from Y, there's a line to X and a line to Z, forming a right angle. Let me assume that Y is at (0,0), X is at (0, b), and Z is at (c, 0), but since the angle between Y-X and Y-Z is 90 degrees, that would make sense if X is vertical and Z is horizontal from Y. Wait, but earlier we had that Y is on line TW, so if Y is at (0,0), and T is at (-1,0), then W is somewhere on the x-axis. 

Let me define coordinates step by step.

Set Y at (0,0).

Line T-Y has length 1, so T is at (-1, 0).

Line W-Y: since Y is at (0,0), and W is on the line TW, which extends from T(-1,0) through Y(0,0) to W. Let's say W is at (k, 0), where k > 0. So the distance from Y(0,0) to W(k,0) is |k| units. We'll determine k later.

From Y(0,0), there is a right angle between X and Z. Let me assume that X is vertically above Y, and Z is horizontally to the right of Y, forming a right angle. So X would be at (0, a), and Z would be at (b, 0). But wait, Z is connected to X via Line(X,Z), which has length 3. So the distance between X(0,a) and Z(b,0) is sqrt((b)^2 + (a)^2) = 3. Also, from Z to W is length 4. Since W is at (k,0), and Z is at (b,0), the distance from Z to W is |k - b| = 4. So k = b Â± 4. 

Also, the line from Z to W is part of the figure, and there's a line from W to Y (which is already defined). 

Additionally, there's a line from X to Z, which is length 3, and from Z to W, length 4. 

Furthermore, there's a line from X to Z, and from Z to W. Also, there's a line from T to Z, which is given as part of the bisector. 

Moreover, the measure of Angle(T,Y,X) is 52 degrees. Angle(T,Y,X) is the angle at Y between T and X. Since T is at (-1,0), Y is at (0,0), and X is at (0,a). So the angle between vectors YT (from Y to T) and YX (from Y to X). The vector YT is (-1, 0), and YX is (0, a). The angle between these vectors is 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, the angle at Y between T and X. Since T is left of Y on the x-axis, and X is upwards from Y. So the angle between YT (pointing left) and YX (pointing up) is 90 degrees? Wait, but the given measure is 52 degrees. Contradiction. So my assumption must be wrong.

Ah, here's the issue: if I assumed that X is directly above Y, then the angle at Y between T and X would be 90 degrees, but the given measure is 52 degrees. Therefore, my coordinate system assumption is incorrect. 

So, the angle between YT and YX is 52 degrees, not 90. Therefore, the lines YT and YX are not perpendicular. So my previous assumption about the direction of X is wrong. 

Let me reconsider. Let me denote Y at (0,0), T at (-1,0) as before. The line YT is from Y(0,0) to T(-1,0). The line YX makes an angle of 52 degrees with YT. So the angle between YT (along negative x-axis) and YX is 52 degrees. Therefore, the direction of YX is 52 degrees above the negative x-axis. So if we consider standard position, the direction from Y to X is 180 - 52 = 128 degrees from positive x-axis. 

Let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let me suppose that the length of YX is some value, say 'm'. Then, coordinates of X would be (m*cos(theta), m*sin(theta)), where theta is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since the angle between YT (negative x-axis) and YX is 52 degrees, theta is 180 - 52 = 128 degrees. So cos(theta) = cos(128Â°), sin(theta) = sin(128Â°).

But we also have the right angle at Y between X and Z. So the line YZ is perpendicular to YX. So the direction of YZ is perpendicular to YX. If YX is at 128 degrees, then YZ is at 128Â° - 90Â° = 38Â° or 128Â° + 90Â° = 218Â°. Depending on which direction the right angle opens. 

Let me pick one direction. Suppose that YZ is at 38Â° from positive x-axis. Then, the direction of YZ is 38 degrees. Let me denote the length of YZ as 'n', so coordinates of Z would be (n*cos(38Â°), n*sin(38Â°)).

Now, we also have the line from Z to W, which has length 4. And from earlier, the line from X to Z has length 3. 

So, coordinates of Z are (n*cos(38Â°), n*sin(38Â°)), and coordinates of X are (m*cos(128Â°), m*sin(128Â°)). The distance between X and Z is 3, so:

sqrt[(n*cos(38Â°) - m*cos(128Â°))^2 + (n*sin(38Â°) - m*sin(128Â°))^2] = 3.

That's one equation.

Also, the line from Z to W has length 4. Since W is on the line TW, which extends from T(-1,0) through Y(0,0) to W(k,0). So W is at (k, 0). The distance from Z to W is |k - n*cos(38Â°)| = 4, assuming Z is at (n*cos(38Â°), ...). Wait, no. Wait, Z's x-coordinate is n*cos(38Â°), and W is at (k, 0). So the distance between Z and W is sqrt[(k - n*cos(38Â°))^2 + (0 - n*sin(38Â°))^2] = sqrt[(k - n*cos(38Â°))^2 + (n^2 sinÂ²(38Â°))] = sqrt[kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² cosÂ²(38Â°) + nÂ² sinÂ²(38Â°)] = sqrt[kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² (cosÂ²(38Â°) + sinÂ²(38Â°))] = sqrt[kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ²]. So this equals 4. 

Thus, sqrt[kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ²] = 4 â†’ square both sides: kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² = 16.

But I also have the distance between X and Z equals 3. Let's write that equation:

sqrt[(n*cos(38Â°) - m*cos(128Â°))^2 + (n*sin(38Â°) - m*sin(128Â°))^2]^2 = 9.

Which simplifies to:

(n*cos(38Â°) - m*cos(128Â°))^2 + (n*sin(38Â°) - m*sin(128Â°))^2 = 9.

Expanding this:

nÂ² cosÂ²(38Â°) - 2mn cos(38Â°) cos(128Â°) + mÂ² cosÂ²(128Â°) + nÂ² sinÂ²(38Â°) - 2mn sin(38Â°) sin(128Â°) + mÂ² sinÂ²(128Â°) = 9.

Combine terms:

nÂ² (cosÂ²(38Â°) + sinÂ²(38Â°)) + mÂ² (cosÂ²(128Â°) + sinÂ²(128Â°)) - 2mn [cos(38Â°) cos(128Â°) + sin(38Â°) sin(128Â°)] = 9.

Using identity cosÂ²Î¸ + sinÂ²Î¸ = 1, this becomes:

nÂ² + mÂ² - 2mn cos(38Â° - 128Â°) = 9.

Because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So the term inside the brackets is cos(38Â° - 128Â°) = cos(-90Â°) = cos(90Â°) = 0. Wait, cos(-90Â°) is 0. So the entire expression reduces to nÂ² + mÂ² - 2mn * 0 = nÂ² + mÂ² = 9.

So we get nÂ² + mÂ² = 9. Interesting. So regardless of the angles, the sum of squares of n and m is 9. 

But we also have other equations. Let's recall that there's a line from T to Z, which is part of the bisector. Also, there's the bisector condition involving Angle(T,W,Z). But this seems getting complicated. Let me think if there's another way.

Alternatively, since we have the measure of Angle(W,Y,Z) as 38 degrees. Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between W and Z. Since W is on the line extending from T through Y to W. So the line YW is along the x-axis from Y(0,0) to W(k,0). The line YZ is at 38 degrees from the x-axis. So the angle between YW (along x-axis) and YZ is 38 degrees. Which matches the given measure. So this confirms that the direction of YZ is at 38 degrees from the x-axis, hence the earlier calculation.

So, the angle between YW (x-axis) and YZ is 38 degrees, which is consistent with the given measure. 

Now, the line from Z to W has length 4, and the line from X to Z has length 3. Also, we have the line from T to Z, which is involved in the angle bisector. 

Additionally, there's a line from X to Z (length 3), and from Z to W (length 4). Also, from Y to Z (length n), and from Y to X (length m). With nÂ² + mÂ² = 9.

But how do we find n and m? Maybe we need more information. Let's think about the other given lengths. 

The length of Line(W,X) is 2. So the distance between W and X is 2. Coordinates of W are (k, 0), coordinates of X are (m*cos(128Â°), m*sin(128Â°)). So the distance squared between W and X is (k - m*cos(128Â°))^2 + (0 - m*sin(128Â°))^2 = kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² cosÂ²(128Â°) + mÂ² sinÂ²(128Â°) = kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² (cosÂ²(128Â°) + sinÂ²(128Â°)) = kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² = 4 (since length is 2, squared is 4). 

So we have another equation: kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² = 4.

Earlier, we had from the distance between Z and W: kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² = 16.

And from the distance between X and Z: nÂ² + mÂ² = 9.

So now we have three equations:

1. nÂ² + mÂ² = 9. (Equation A)
2. kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² = 4. (Equation B)
3. kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² = 16. (Equation C)

But we have three variables: k, m, n. Let's see if we can express these equations in terms of each other.

From Equation A: nÂ² = 9 - mÂ². Substituting into Equation C:

kÂ² - 2k*(sqrt(9 - mÂ²))*cos(38Â°) + (9 - mÂ²) = 16.

But this seems messy. Maybe we can find relations between k and m? 

Alternatively, notice that Equation B and Equation C both have kÂ² and mÂ²/nÂ² terms. Let me subtract Equation B from Equation C:

(Equation C) - (Equation B):

[ kÂ² - 2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² ] - [ kÂ² - 2km cos(128Â°) + mÂ² ] = 16 - 4 = 12.

Simplify:

-2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² - (-2km cos(128Â°)) - mÂ² = 12.

â†’ -2kn cos(38Â°) + nÂ² + 2km cos(128Â°) - mÂ² = 12.

Group terms:

nÂ² - mÂ² + 2k[m cos(128Â°) - n cos(38Â°)] = 12.

But from Equation A, nÂ² - mÂ² = 9 - 2mÂ². Wait, no: nÂ² = 9 - mÂ², so nÂ² - mÂ² = 9 - 2mÂ². Wait, no:

Wait, nÂ² = 9 - mÂ² â‡’ nÂ² - mÂ² = (9 - mÂ²) - mÂ² = 9 - 2mÂ². So substituting:

9 - 2mÂ² + 2k[m cos(128Â°) - n cos(38Â°)] = 12.

Rearranged:

2k[m cos(128Â°) - n cos(38Â°)] = 12 - 9 + 2mÂ² = 3 + 2mÂ².

So,

k = [3 + 2mÂ²]/[2(m cos(128Â°) - n cos(38Â°))].

But this still involves both m and n, and n is related to m via nÂ² = 9 - mÂ². This seems too complex. Maybe there's another approach.

Let me think about the angle bisector conditions. The problem states that Line(T,Z) bisects Angle(T,W,Z), and Line(W,Y) bisects the same angle. Wait, but earlier confusion about the angle location. Let me assume that the angle in question is at Z, between T and W. So Angle(T,Z,W), and both Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) bisect it. Wait, but Line(T,Z) is from T to Z, which would be one side of the angle. If the angle is at Z, then the bisector should be a line from Z. But the bisector is Line(T,Z), which is a side of the angle, so it can't be a bisector. Hence, this suggests that the angle is at W, between T and Z. So Angle(T,W,Z), which is at W between T and Z. The bisector is Line(T,Z), which is a line from T to Z. How does this line bisect the angle at W? It would need to pass through W. But Line(T,Z) starts at T and ends at Z. So unless W lies on this line, which would mean that W is on line TZ. 

But earlier, we have that W is on line TY extended, which goes through Y. So if W is on line TZ, then line TZ passes through W. Let me explore this possibility.

If line TZ passes through W, then W lies on line TZ. So points T, Z, W are colinear. But earlier, we had that W is on line TY, which goes through Y. So if both lines TZ and TY pass through W, then W is the intersection point of lines TZ and TY. But from the given predicates, Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. Wait, the IntersectAt predicate says Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. So Line(T,Z) ends at Z, and Line(W,Y) passes through Z. So if W is on line TZ, then line TZ passes through W, but the intersection point of Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) is Z. So line WY passes through Z, and line TZ passes through W. So W is on line TZ, and Z is on line WY. 

This suggests that points T, Z, W are colinear, and points W, Y, Z are colinear? Wait, no. Line(W,Y) passes through Z, so W, Y, Z are colinear. But if T, Z, W are colinear, then all four points T, Z, W, Y are on a single line? Wait, no. If W is on line TZ, and Y is on line WY (which passes through Z), then Y is on line WZ. So points W, Y, Z are colinear. And T, Z, W are colinear. So this implies that all points T, Z, W, Y are on the same line? Because T-Z-W are colinear, and W-Y-Z are colinear. So yes, all four points T, Y, Z, W are on the same line. 

But earlier, we had that the angle at Y between X and Z is a right angle. So if Y is on the line TZ, then the line YZ is part of the line TZ. So the right angle at Y between X and Z would mean that line YX is perpendicular to line YZ. Since YZ is along the line TZ, which is the same as line TW. So YX is perpendicular to line TW. 

This aligns with the earlier scenario where Y is on line TW, and X is perpendicular to TW at Y. 

So, given that, let me redefine the coordinates with this new understanding.

Let me set line TW as the x-axis. Let me place Y at the origin (0,0). T is to the left of Y, and W is to the right of Y. So T is at (-a, 0), Y at (0,0), W at (b, 0), with a and b positive numbers. 

Since the length of Line(T,Y) is 1, the distance between T and Y is a = 1. So T is at (-1, 0). W is at (b, 0). 

Now, the line YZ is part of line TW, so Z is also on the x-axis. Wait, but earlier we had a right angle at Y between X and Z. If Z is on the x-axis, then YX must be perpendicular to the x-axis, so YX is vertical. So X is at (0, c) for some c. 

Then, the line from X to Z is from (0,c) to Z, which is on the x-axis. Let's say Z is at (d, 0). The distance between X and Z is sqrt(dÂ² + cÂ²) = 3. 

Also, the line from Z to W is from (d,0) to (b,0), which has length |b - d| = 4. So b - d = 4 (assuming b > d). 

Also, the line from X to Z has length 3, so dÂ² + cÂ² = 9. 

Additionally, the measure of Angle(W,Y,Z) is 38 degrees. Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between W and Z. Since W is at (b,0), Y is at (0,0), and Z is at (d,0). Wait, but if Z is on the x-axis, then the angle at Y between W and Z is zero degrees, since both W and Z are on the x-axis. But the given measure is 38 degrees. Contradiction. So this suggests that Z is not on the x-axis. 

Wait, this indicates a problem. Earlier assumption that Z is on line TW is leading to contradiction. What went wrong?

Ah! The line YZ is not on line TW. Earlier, I thought that because Line(W,Y) passes through Z, and Line(T,Z) passes through W, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Z is on line TW. Wait, Line(W,Y) passes through Z, so W, Y, Z are colinear. Line(T,Z) passes through W, so T, Z, W are colinear. Therefore, all points T, Z, W, Y are on the same line. Hence, Y is on line TZ, and Z is between T and W? Or W is between T and Z?

Wait, Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. So Line(T,Z) ends at Z, and Line(W,Y) passes through Z. So W is on Line(W,Y), which passes through Z. So Z is on Line(W,Y). So points W, Y, Z are colinear. Also, T, Z, W are colinear (since Line(T,Z) passes through W). So all four points T, Z, W, Y are on the same line. 

But then, if Y is on line TZ, then the right angle at Y between X and Z implies that line YX is perpendicular to line YZ (which is on the same line as TZ). So line YX is perpendicular to line TZ. Hence, X is off the line TZ, forming a right angle at Y. 

So, let me redefine the coordinates with this.

Let me take line TZ as the x-axis, with Y somewhere on it. Let me set Y at (0,0), T at (-1,0), W at (w,0), and Z at (z,0). Since Line(T,Z) passes through W, then W is on line TZ. So z < w (assuming Z is between T and W, or vice versa). 

The right angle at Y between X and Z: so line YX is perpendicular to line YZ. Since YZ is on the x-axis, YX is vertical. So X is at (0, h) for some h. 

Then, the line from X(0,h) to Z(z,0) has length 3: sqrt((z-0)^2 + (0-h)^2) = sqrt(zÂ² + hÂ²) = 3 â†’ zÂ² + hÂ² = 9.

Also, the line from Z(z,0) to W(w,0) has length |w - z| = 4. Assume w > z, so w = z + 4.

Also, the measure of Angle(W,Y,Z) is 38 degrees. Angle at Y between W and Z. Since W and Z are on the x-axis, the angle between YW and YZ is zero degrees, which contradicts the given 38 degrees. So this is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake in assuming that Z is on line TZ.

Wait, this suggests that my previous conclusion that Z is on line TZ is incorrect. Where is the error?

The IntersectAt predicate says that Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y) intersect at Z. So Line(T,Z) is from T to Z, and Line(W,Y) is from W to Y, and they intersect at Z. This means that Z is the endpoint of Line(T,Z) and lies on Line(W,Y). So Z is on Line(W,Y). Therefore, points W, Y, Z are colinear. Also, Line(T,Z) starts at T and ends at Z, so Z is on Line(T,Z). Therefore, Z is on both Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y), meaning Z is the intersection point of Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y). 

So Z is the intersection of Line(T,Z) and Line(W,Y). But Line(T,Z) is from T to Z, so Z is its endpoint. Line(W,Y) is from W to Y, passing through Z. So Z is a point on Line(W,Y), which means
