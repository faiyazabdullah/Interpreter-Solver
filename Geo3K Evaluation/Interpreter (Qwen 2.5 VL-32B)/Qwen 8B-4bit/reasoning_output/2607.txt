<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, AE, BE, BD. Also, there are triangles mentioned: ABE, BCE, BCD. Angles at AEB, BEC, BDC are right angles. Some lengths are given as expressions involving variables x. Specifically, Length(AE) = 5, Length(BD) = 3, Length(BE) = x+3, Length(BC) = 2x-8. Also, some perpendicularity conditions: AE ⊥ BE, BE ⊥ EC, BD ⊥ DC. 

The question is asking for BC, which is given as 2x - 8. So we need to find the value of x first, then compute BC. Alternatively, maybe there's another way if we can find BC directly through geometric relations.

Let me visualize the diagram. Since there are right angles at AEB, BEC, and BDC. Let me try to sketch mentally. Starting with point B connected to E, since BE is a common side in multiple triangles. Also, AE is connected to E, forming a right angle at E between AE and BE. Similarly, BE is perpendicular to EC, so EC is vertical if BE is horizontal? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Assign coordinates to points and use equations.

Let me assign coordinates. Let's place point E at the origin (0,0) because there are several perpendicular lines meeting at E. Then, since AE is perpendicular to BE, and BE is part of the right angle at E. Let me assume BE is along the y-axis and AE along the x-axis. Wait, but AE has length 5. Let me think.

Suppose E is at (0,0). Let’s take BE as vertical. So point B would be somewhere along the y-axis. Let’s say B is at (0, b). Then, since AE is perpendicular to BE, AE would be horizontal. So point A would be along the x-axis. Let me denote A as (a, 0). The length AE is 5, so distance from A(a,0) to E(0,0) is |a| = 5. So a = ±5. Let's pick a positive value for simplicity, so A is (5, 0).

Now, BE is from E(0,0) to B(0,b). The length of BE is x+3. So the distance from B to E is sqrt((0-0)^2 + (b-0)^2) = |b|. Therefore, |b| = x + 3. Assuming b is positive, so b = x + 3.

Next, looking at the right angle at BEC. That means BE is perpendicular to EC. Since BE is vertical (along y-axis), EC must be horizontal. So point C lies along the horizontal line from E(0,0). But wait, EC is connected to point C. Wait, the line EC is part of the triangle BEC, which includes points B, E, C. Since BE is vertical and EC is horizontal (since they're perpendicular), then point C would be along the x-axis. Wait, but E is at (0,0). So if EC is horizontal, then C would be (c, 0). However, there's also a line CD connected to D. Let me check other connections.

Also, there's a line BD connected to D. And line DC connects D to C. Also, there's a triangle BCD with BD and DC being perpendicular. Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(BD), Line(DC)). So BD is perpendicular to DC. So BD and DC meet at D and form a right angle.

So let me try to track coordinates. Let me note down:

Points:

E = (0, 0)

A = (5, 0) since AE = 5.

B = (0, b) where b = x + 3.

Since BE is vertical, EC is horizontal. So EC goes from E(0,0) to C(c, 0). Wait, but then C would be on the x-axis. But then line EC is horizontal. However, there's also a line CD connected to D. Also, line BD connects B(0, b) to D. And line DC connects D to C(c, 0). Also, BD is perpendicular to DC.

So point D is somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to DC. Let me think about coordinates for D. Let me suppose D has coordinates (d_x, d_y). Then BD vector is from B(0, b) to D(d_x, d_y): (d_x - 0, d_y - b) = (d_x, d_y - b). DC vector is from D(d_x, d_y) to C(c, 0): (c - d_x, 0 - d_y). These two vectors should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

BD • DC = d_x*(c - d_x) + (d_y - b)*(-d_y) = 0.

But this seems complicated without knowing c, d_x, d_y. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since BD is perpendicular to DC, and DC is connected to C which is on the x-axis (assuming EC is horizontal). Let me see if I can express coordinates for D.

Wait, also, there's a triangle BCD. So points B, C, D. Since BD is one side and DC is another. Also, line CD is connected. Also, there's a line BC connected. From earlier, BC has length 2x - 8. So once we find coordinates for B and C, we can compute BC's length.

But perhaps I need more constraints. Let me look for other info.

Looking back at the triangles:

Triangle ABE: points A, B, E. Which we've already placed as A(5,0), B(0,b), E(0,0). This forms a right triangle at E, since AE and BE are perpendicular. So that checks out with the right angle at AEB.

Triangle BEC: points B, E, C. Right angle at E (since BE ⊥ EC). So again, right triangle at E. Thus, BE is vertical, EC horizontal. So point C is (c, 0). Then EC length is |c - 0| = |c|. So length EC is c, assuming c > 0. Then, BE length is b = x + 3, as before.

Then, in triangle BEC, we can use Pythagoras: BE² + EC² = BC². Because it's a right triangle at E. So BC² = (x + 3)² + c². But BC is given as 2x - 8. Therefore:

(2x - 8)² = (x + 3)² + c².

That's equation (1).

Now, looking at triangle BCD. Points B(0, b), C(c, 0), D. Also, BD is perpendicular to DC. So BD ⊥ DC. Let me find coordinates of D.

Also, there's a line CD connected. Since DC is connected to C(c, 0), and BD is connected to D. Also, there's a line BD connected, and line DC connected. Also, from the given, there's a line BD and DC. Also, line CD is part of triangle BCD.

Additionally, there's a line CD connected, which is part of the triangle BCD. Also, the line BD is connected to D. Let me think about how to find coordinates for D. Since BD is perpendicular to DC, and D is connected to C(c, 0) and B(0, b). Let me consider coordinates for D.

Let me parametrize D. Suppose D lies somewhere. Since BD is perpendicular to DC, then the slope of BD times the slope of DC equals -1.

First, slope of BD: from B(0, b) to D(d_x, d_y): m_BD = (d_y - b)/(d_x - 0) = (d_y - b)/d_x.

Slope of DC: from D(d_x, d_y) to C(c, 0): m_DC = (0 - d_y)/(c - d_x) = (-d_y)/(c - d_x).

Their product should be -1:

[(d_y - b)/d_x] * [(-d_y)/(c - d_x)] = -1

Multiply both sides by d_x(c - d_x):

-(d_y)(d_y - b) = -d_x(c - d_x)

Simplify:

-d_y^2 + b d_y = -d_x c + d_x^2

Rearranged:

d_x^2 - d_x c + d_y^2 - b d_y = 0.

Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since BD is perpendicular to DC, vector BD · vector DC = 0.

Vector BD is (d_x - 0, d_y - b) = (d_x, d_y - b).

Vector DC is (c - d_x, 0 - d_y) = (c - d_x, -d_y).

Dot product:

d_x(c - d_x) + (d_y - b)(-d_y) = 0.

Which gives:

d_x c - d_x^2 - d_y^2 + b d_y = 0.

Equation (2): d_x c - d_x^2 - d_y^2 + b d_y = 0.

This seems complex unless we have more info about D.

Are there other constraints on D? Well, there's a line CD connected. Also, there's a line BD connected, and line CD connected. Also, there's triangle BCD. Are there other lines? For example, line CD is connected, and line BC is connected. Also, line BD is connected. But I don't know if there are other constraints on D. Perhaps there's another relation?

Wait, there's also line BD connected. Is there anything else about D? Let me check the given predicates. There's a line BD, and line DC. Also, the line CD is part of triangle BCD. Also, line BC is connected. Also, line BD is part of triangle BCD.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check if there's more info. The problem mentions line CD, which connects to D, but perhaps D is connected to other points? Or maybe there's a relationship between D and other points?

Alternatively, maybe D lies on some line? For instance, since there's a line BD and DC, and possibly other lines. Alternatively, perhaps considering the entire figure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle or right angle involving D. Let me check the given predicates again. There's a right angle at Angle(B,D,C), which is the angle at D between B-D-C. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)), which means that angle at D between B, D, C is a right angle. So triangle BCD is a right triangle at D. Therefore, triangle BCD is right-angled at D. Hence, BD ⊥ DC, which we already knew. So that's consistent.

Therefore, triangle BCD is right-angled at D. So, applying Pythagoras to triangle BCD: BD² + DC² = BC².

Wait, BD is one leg, DC is another leg, and BC is hypotenuse. Wait, but BC is given as 2x - 8. So:

BD² + DC² = BC².

From earlier, BD's length is given as 3. Wait, yes! The predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3). So BD = 3. Therefore, BD is 3 units long. So BD² = 9.

Thus, from Pythagoras:

BD² + DC² = BC² → 9 + DC² = (2x - 8)².

But DC is the length from D to C. Let me find DC in terms of coordinates. Earlier, point C is (c, 0). Point D is (d_x, d_y). So DC length squared is (c - d_x)^2 + (0 - d_y)^2 = (c - d_x)^2 + d_y².

But from equation (2):

From earlier, we had:

d_x c - d_x^2 - d_y^2 + b d_y = 0.

Let me rearrange that:

d_x c - d_x^2 = d_y^2 - b d_y.

But DC² = (c - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = c² - 2c d_x + d_x² + d_y².

So substituting from above:

= c² - 2c d_x + d_x² + d_y²

But from equation (2):

d_x c - d_x² = d_y² - b d_y → rearranged as:

d_x c = d_x² + d_y² - b d_y.

Substituting into DC²:

= c² - 2c d_x + d_x² + d_y²

Replace 2c d_x with 2*(d_x c) = 2*(d_x² + d_y² - b d_y)

So:

= c² - 2*(d_x² + d_y² - b d_y) + d_x² + d_y²

= c² - 2d_x² - 2d_y² + 2b d_y + d_x² + d_y²

= c² - d_x² - d_y² + 2b d_y.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Since DC² = (from Pythagoras) BC² - BD² = (2x-8)^2 - 9.

But DC² can also be expressed as (distance from D to C)^2. However, without knowing coordinates of D, this might not help directly. Unless there's another relation.

Wait, but earlier, from triangle BEC, we had BC² = (x + 3)^2 + c². And BC is also equal to 2x - 8. So:

(2x - 8)^2 = (x + 3)^2 + c² → Equation (1).

And from triangle BCD, we have:

BD² + DC² = BC² → 9 + DC² = (2x - 8)^2 → DC² = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

But DC is also the distance from D to C. However, unless there's a way to relate DC to other quantities, this might not help. Wait, but maybe we can find DC from another source?

Alternatively, since EC is horizontal from E(0,0) to C(c, 0). Then, point D is connected via DC. Also, BD is connected. Maybe there's another relation involving D?

Wait, there's also line CD connected. So line CD is part of triangle BCD. But I'm not seeing a direct connection. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since BD is length 3, and BD is from B(0, b) to D(d_x, d_y), then:

sqrt( (d_x - 0)^2 + (d_y - b)^2 ) = 3 → (d_x)^2 + (d_y - b)^2 = 9. Equation (3).

Also, from the previous equation (equation (2)):

d_x c - d_x^2 - d_y^2 + b d_y = 0.

Let me write equation (3) as:

d_x^2 + d_y^2 - 2b d_y + b^2 = 9. Wait, expanding (d_y - b)^2 = d_y^2 - 2b d_y + b². So equation (3) becomes:

d_x² + d_y² - 2b d_y + b² = 9. Rearranged as:

d_x² + d_y² = 2b d_y + (9 - b²). Equation (3a).

Now, substitute this into equation (2):

From equation (2): d_x c - d_x^2 - d_y^2 + b d_y = 0.

Replace d_x^2 + d_y^2 with 2b d_y + (9 - b²):

So,

d_x c - [2b d_y + (9 - b²)] + b d_y = 0.

Simplify:

d_x c - 2b d_y - 9 + b² + b d_y = 0 → d_x c - b d_y - 9 + b² = 0 → d_x c = b d_y + 9 - b². Equation (4).

Not sure yet. Let me think if there's another equation involving d_x and d_y. Maybe from triangle BCD?

Wait, we also have DC² = (2x - 8)^2 - 9, as per Pythagoras in triangle BCD. Also, DC² is (c - d_x)^2 + (0 - d_y)^2 = (c - d_x)^2 + d_y^2.

So:

(c - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = (2x - 8)^2 - 9. Equation (5).

Expanding (c - d_x)^2:

c² - 2c d_x + d_x² + d_y^2 = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

But from equation (3a), d_x² + d_y^2 = 2b d_y + (9 - b²). Substituting into equation (5):

c² - 2c d_x + [2b d_y + (9 - b²)] = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

So:

c² - 2c d_x + 2b d_y + 9 - b² = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

Bring all terms to left:

c² - 2c d_x + 2b d_y + 9 - b² - [(2x - 8)^2 - 9] = 0.

Simplify:

c² - 2c d_x + 2b d_y + 9 - b² - (2x - 8)^2 + 9 = 0.

Combine constants:

c² - 2c d_x + 2b d_y - b² - (2x - 8)^2 + 18 = 0.

Hmm, this seems too complex. Maybe there's another way.

Let me recall from equation (4): d_x c = b d_y + 9 - b². So, solving for d_x:

d_x = [b d_y + 9 - b²]/c. Equation (4a).

Plugging this into equation (5):

(c - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = ... ?

But even with substitution, it's getting messy. Let me think if there's another relation involving c.

Earlier, from triangle BEC: BC² = (x + 3)^2 + c². And BC is also 2x - 8. So:

(2x - 8)^2 = (x + 3)^2 + c² → expand both sides:

Left: 4x² - 32x + 64.

Right: x² + 6x + 9 + c².

Thus:

4x² -32x +64 = x² + 6x +9 + c² → rearranged:

3x² -38x +55 = c². Equation (6).

So c² = 3x² -38x +55.

Now, going back to equation (5):

(c - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

Expand left side:

c² - 2c d_x + d_x² + d_y^2.

But from equation (3a), d_x² + d_y^2 = 2b d_y + (9 - b²).

So substituting:

c² - 2c d_x + 2b d_y + 9 - b² = (2x - 8)^2 - 9.

But from equation (4a), d_x = [b d_y + 9 - b²]/c. So:

-2c d_x = -2c * [b d_y + 9 - b²]/c = -2[b d_y + 9 - b²].

Thus, substituting into the equation:

c² -2[b d_y + 9 - b²] + 2b d_y + 9 - b² = (2x - 8)^2 -9.

Simplify term by term:

c² -2b d_y -18 + 2b² + 2b d_y +9 - b² = (2x -8)^2 -9.

Simplify:

c² -18 + 2b² +9 -b² = (2x -8)^2 -9.

Which becomes:

c² -9 + b² = (2x -8)^2 -9.

Adding 9 to both sides:

c² + b² = (2x -8)^2.

But from equation (6), c² = 3x² -38x +55. And b = x + 3 (since BE length is x+3). So b² = (x +3)^2 = x² +6x +9.

Thus:

c² + b² = (3x² -38x +55) + (x² +6x +9) = 4x² -32x +64.

Which is equal to (2x -8)^2, since (2x-8)^2 = 4x² -32x +64. Perfect! So this holds true regardless of x, which means our equations are consistent. So this doesn't give us new information.

Hmm. So this suggests that the equations are dependent and we need another way to find x. What else do we have?

Wait, perhaps there's another relation involving c. Let me think.

From earlier, point C is (c, 0). Also, there's a line CD connected. Additionally, there's line BD connected. Are there any other constraints on point D? Not directly, unless there's another right angle or triangle.

Wait, the line CD is connected, and line DC is part of triangle BCD. Also, there's line BD. Are there any other lines or triangles that involve D?

Looking back at the given predicates, there's also line CD, which connects to D. Also, there's line BD. Also, line BC is connected. But I don't see other constraints on D.

Wait, but there's also line CD connected to D. Could there be another right angle involving D? No, because the only right angles are at AEB, BEC, and BDC. So angle at D is already accounted for.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between c and other variables. Let me think. We have from equation (6): c² = 3x² -38x +55. Also, from triangle BEC, BC² = (x+3)^2 + c² = (2x-8)^2. Which we used to derive equation (6). So that's already considered.

Is there another equation involving c? Maybe from the position of point D? Like, maybe D lies on some other line?

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle involving D? For example, triangle AED or something? But the given predicates don't mention those. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check again the given predicates for any other clues.

Given that there's a line CD connected, and line BD connected. Also, there's a line AE, BE, BD, etc. Wait, but there's also line AE and BE. Are there any other triangles or relationships?

Wait, there's a triangle ABE, which we've already considered. Also, triangle BEC and BCD. What about triangle AED? Not sure.

Alternatively, since AE is 5 units, and A is at (5, 0), E is at (0,0). So AE is along x-axis. Now, what about other points?

Wait, there's a line from D to C, and from B to D. Also, there's a line from D to C. Maybe there's something about the location of D relative to other points?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between c and b? Let me think. Since BE is vertical from E(0,0) to B(0, b). EC is horizontal from E(0,0) to C(c, 0). So EC has length c. In triangle BEC, right-angled at E, so BC² = BE² + EC² = b² + c². Which we already used.

But we also have BC = 2x - 8. So combining with BE = x + 3, we get:

(2x - 8)^2 = (x + 3)^2 + c².

But we also have from earlier, c² = 3x² -38x +55. So substituting:

(2x - 8)^2 = (x + 3)^2 + (3x² -38x +55).

Let me calculate both sides:

Left side: (2x -8)^2 = 4x² -32x +64.

Right side: (x² +6x +9) + (3x² -38x +55) = 4x² -32x +64. Which matches. So again, no new info.

So I need another equation to solve for x. Where can I find it?

Perhaps there's something about point D? Let me think. Since D is connected to B and C, and we have BD = 3. Also, from equation (4a): d_x = [b d_y + 9 - b²]/c. But without knowing d_x or d_y, it's hard to proceed. Unless there's another condition.

Wait, what about the coordinates of D? Is there any other constraint? For example, does D lie on a particular line or have any relation to other points? The given predicates mention line BD and DC, but no others. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, there's also a line from D to C, and line CD is connected. Also, there's line CD connected. Are there any other lines involving D? Like, maybe line AD or something? No, the given lines are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, AE, BE, BD. So no AD or other lines.

Wait, but there's a line DE connected. Wait, the given lines include Line(D,E). So DE is a line. So point D is connected to E. Wait, did I miss that? Yes! The line DE exists. So point D is connected to E. Oh! That's important.

So there's a line DE. So point D is connected to E(0,0). Therefore, D lies somewhere such that it's connected to E. So line DE is present. Therefore, D lies somewhere along the line from E(0,0) to D, but we need to define its coordinates. Wait, but we don't know where D is on that line. Unless there's another condition.

Wait, line DE is given. So point D is connected to E(0,0). So DE is a line segment from D to E. So D is a point connected to E. Therefore, D lies somewhere in the plane with E(0,0). But how does this help?

Well, since D is connected to E, maybe we can express coordinates of D in terms of parameters. Let me assume that DE has some length, but I don't know. But since there's no given length for DE, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since there's a line DE, and line BD, and line DC, maybe there's a relation involving these lines. For example, maybe triangle BDE or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, since D is connected to E and to C, and to B. Let me think about coordinates again. Point D is connected to E(0,0), B(0, b), and C(c, 0). So three points: B(0, b), C(c, 0), E(0,0), and D is connected to all of them. Wait, no— D is connected to B and C, and to E. So D is connected to E via line DE. So DE is a separate line. So D is somewhere such that it is connected to E, B, and C. Wait, but how? It depends on how the lines are arranged. Maybe D is a point where multiple lines meet. 

Wait, the line DE is given. So D is connected to E, and also connected to B and C via lines BD and CD. So D is connected to three points: B, C, and E. Therefore, D is a common point in multiple lines. So D is connected to B, to C, and to E. So the lines are BD, CD, DE.

So, D is connected to E, so DE is a line. So coordinates of D are (d_x, d_y), and E is (0,0). So line DE is from D(d_x, d_y) to E(0,0). So the line DE passes through E and D. But how does this help?

Maybe there's a relation between D and other points. For example, maybe triangle EDC or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, since we have BD = 3, and BE is from (0, b) to (0,0), and BD is from (0, b) to D(d_x, d_y), with length 3. Also, DE is from D(d_x, d_y) to E(0,0), so length DE is sqrt(d_x² + d_y²). But we don't know DE's length.

However, there's a line DE, but no length given. So maybe not helpful.

Wait, but there's a line DE and line AE. Are they related? Line AE is from A(5,0) to E(0,0). Line DE is from D to E(0,0). So maybe there's a relation between DE and AE? Not necessarily.

Wait, but there's also a line from A to E, which is already considered. Maybe not helpful.

At this point, I seem stuck because I can't find another equation to solve for x. All the existing equations lead back to identities or depend on each other. So maybe I need to revisit the earlier equations.

We have from equation (6): c² = 3x² -38x +55.

Also, from earlier, in triangle BEC, BC² = (x+3)^2 + c² = (2x - 8)^2.

But we also have from triangle BCD: BD² + DC² = BC² → 9 + DC² = (2x -8)^2 → DC² = (2x-8)^2 -9.

But DC is the distance from D to C, which is sqrt( (c - d_x)^2 + (0 - d_y)^2 ). But without knowing d_x and d_y, I can't proceed further.

Wait, but maybe there's another relation involving c? Let me think. Since point C is (c, 0), and there's a line CD connected. Also, line CD is connected to D. But I don't know where D is. However, since D is connected to E, maybe we can find coordinates of D in terms of c and other variables?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express DC in terms of c and other variables. For example, since DC is connected to C(c, 0), and D is connected to E(0,0), and to B(0, b). So D is a point connected to E(0,0), B(0, b), and C(c, 0). So D is a common point in three lines: BD, CD, DE.

Wait, but how can we find coordinates of D? Let me think. Let me consider that D lies somewhere such that it is connected to B, C, and E. So, for example, maybe D lies on the intersection of certain lines. For example, since D is connected to B and C, it lies on line BC? No, because line BC is from B(0, b) to C(c, 0). If D were on line BC, then it would satisfy the equation of line BC. But we also know that BD is perpendicular to DC, which would mean that D is the foot of the perpendicular from B to BC? Wait, no, because BD is perpendicular to DC, but D is not necessarily on BC.

Wait, but if D is connected to B and C, and BD ⊥ DC, then D is located such that it forms a right angle at D between B-D-C. So, D lies on the circle with diameter BC? No, because for a right angle at D, D must lie on the circle with diameter BC. Wait, yes! According to Thales' theorem, if angle BDC is a right angle, then D lies on the circle whose diameter is BC. So D lies on the circle with diameter BC.

So, coordinates of B(0, b), C(c, 0). The circle with diameter BC has center at midpoint M of BC: ((0 + c)/2, (b + 0)/2) = (c/2, b/2). Radius is half of BC, which is (2x -8)/2 = x -4.

So the equation of the circle is (x - c/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2.

But D lies on this circle. Also, D is connected to E(0,0), so D lies on the line DE. Wait, but DE is just a line from D to E. Without knowing where D is on that line, it's still unclear. But since D lies on both the circle with diameter BC and the line DE, we can find coordinates of D by finding the intersection of these two.

But how? Let me parametrize line DE. Since D lies on line DE, which goes from D to E(0,0). So parametrically, D can be represented as t*(some direction). But since E is at (0,0), and D is some point, the line DE can be parametrized as passing through E and D. However, without knowing the direction or length, it's difficult.

Alternatively, since D is on the circle with diameter BC and also on the line DE. Let me write the equation of line DE. Since D is a point on this line, and E is (0,0), the line DE can be written as y = m x, where m is the slope from E to D. But I don't know m.

But D lies on this line, so its coordinates are (k, mk) for some k. So D = (k, mk). Then, since D also lies on the circle with diameter BC, substituting into the circle equation:

(k - c/2)^2 + (mk - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2.

But x here is the variable from earlier, which is the same as the variable in the expression for BE length (which is x + 3). Wait, this might be confusing notation. Let me clarify:

In the problem statement, Length(BE) = x + 3. So x is a variable representing some value. But in the circle equation, x is used as a coordinate. To avoid confusion, let me rename the variable in the circle equation. Let me call the coordinate x-coordinate as 't', and the y-coordinate as 's'. So D = (t, s), lying on line DE, which passes through E(0,0). So line DE has equation s = m*t, where m is the slope. So D = (t, mt).

Now, plugging into circle equation:

(t - c/2)^2 + (mt - b/2)^2 = (radius)^2.

Radius squared is [(BC)/2]^2 = [(2x -8)/2]^2 = (x -4)^2.

Expanding the circle equation:

(t - c/2)^2 + (mt - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2.

Expanding:

t² - c t + (c²)/4 + m² t² - m b t + (b²)/4 = x² -8x +16.

Combining like terms:

(1 + m²) t² - (c + mb) t + (c² + b²)/4 = x² -8x +16.

But this seems very abstract. However, since D lies on line DE, which is from E(0,0) to D(t, mt), and we also know that BD = 3. So the distance from B(0, b) to D(t, mt) is 3. So:

√[(t - 0)^2 + (mt - b)^2] = 3 → t² + (mt - b)^2 = 9.

Expanding:

t² + m² t² - 2mb t + b² = 9 → (1 + m²)t² - 2mb t + (b² -9) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in t. But we also have the circle equation. Combining these two equations might allow us to eliminate t or m.

But this seems too complex without knowing m or t. Perhaps there's another relation. Let me think.

Alternatively, since D lies on line DE, which goes through E(0,0) and D(t, mt). So the vector ED is (t, mt). Also, the vector BD is from B(0, b) to D(t, mt): (t, mt - b). And we know that BD is perpendicular to DC. Vector DC is from D(t, mt) to C(c, 0): (c - t, -mt).

Their dot product is zero:

BD • DC = t(c - t) + (mt - b)(-mt) = 0.

Expanding:

tc - t² - m² t² + b mt = 0.

Factor:

tc - t²(1 + m²) + b mt = 0.

But from the earlier equation from BD length:

(1 + m²)t² - 2mb t + (b² -9) = 0 → let's call this equation (A).

From the dot product equation:

tc - t²(1 + m²) + b mt = 0 → rearranged:

tc + b mt = t²(1 + m²).

Let me call this equation (B).

Now, from equation (A): (1 + m²)t² = 2mb t - (b² -9).

Substitute this into equation (B):

tc + b mt = [2mb t - (b² -9)].

So:

tc + b mt = 2mb t - (b² -9).

Rearrange:

tc + b mt - 2mb t = -(b² -9).

Factor t:

t[c + bm - 2bm] = -(b² -9).

Simplify inside the brackets:

c + bm - 2bm = c - bm.

So:

t(c - bm) = -(b² -9).

Thus:

t = [-(b² -9)] / (c - bm).

But this still has variables b, m, c. It's not clear how to proceed.

At this point, I realize I might be going in circles. Perhaps I need to make assumptions or find another way.

Let me recall that we have from earlier:

c² = 3x² -38x +55.

And b = x + 3.

Also, from triangle BEC, BC = 2x - 8.

But BC is also the hypotenuse of triangle BEC, which is sqrt(b² + c²). So:

sqrt(b² + c²) = 2x -8 → square both sides:

b² + c² = (2x -8)^2.

But we already used this to derive c² = 3x² -38x +55.

So this doesn't help.

Wait, but maybe we can express c in terms of x, and then find another equation.

Wait, from c² = 3x² -38x +55.

But I need another equation involving c and x. Where can I get it?

Let me think about the line DE and the fact that D lies on it. But without knowing where D is, it's challenging. Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between c and b? Let me think.

From earlier, in triangle BEC, we have b = x + 3, and c is related to x through c² = 3x² -38x +55. But without another relation, I cannot solve for x.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find x using the fact that D lies on the circle with diameter BC and on line DE. Let me try to find the coordinates of D in terms of x, and use the fact that BD = 3.

But this requires expressing everything in terms of x.

Let me attempt this. Let me assume that D lies on the circle with diameter BC. So, as before, the circle has equation (x - c/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2. Wait, no, the radius is (BC)/2 = (2x -8)/2 = x -4. So the equation is (x - c/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2.

Wait, but this uses x as both the variable and the parameter from the problem. To avoid confusion, let me replace x with k. Let me redefine:

Let me call the variable in the circle equation as (X, Y). So the circle equation is (X - c/2)^2 + (Y - b/2)^2 = ( (2x -8)/2 )^2 = (x -4)^2.

Now, D lies on this circle and on line DE, which passes through E(0,0). Let me parametrize D as (t, mt), where m is the slope of DE. So D = (t, mt).

Substituting into the circle equation:

(t - c/2)^2 + (mt - b/2)^2 = (x -4)^2.

Expand:

t² - ct + (c²)/4 + m² t² - m b t + (b²)/4 = x² -8x +16.

Combine terms:

(1 + m²) t² - (c + mb) t + (c² + b²)/4 = x² -8x +16.

But from earlier, we know that c² + b² = (2x -8)^2. So:

(1 + m²) t² - (c + mb) t + [(2x -8)^2]/4 = x² -8x +16.

Let me simplify [(2x -8)^2]/4 = (4x² -32x +64)/4 = x² -8x +16. So the equation becomes:

(1 + m²) t² - (c + mb) t + x² -8x +16 = x² -8x +16.

Subtract x² -8x +16 from both sides:

(1 + m²) t² - (c + mb) t = 0.

So:

t[ (1 + m²) t - (c + mb) ] = 0.

Thus, either t = 0, which would imply D is at E(0,0), but that can't be since D is a distinct point. So the other factor must be zero:

(1 + m²) t - (c + mb) = 0 → t = (c + mb)/(1 + m²).

So, t = (c + mb)/(1 + m²).

Now, we also know that the distance from B(0, b) to D(t, mt) is 3. So:

√[t² + (mt - b)^2] = 3 → t² + (mt - b)^2 = 9.

Expand:

t² + m² t² - 2mb t + b² = 9 → (1 + m²) t² - 2mb t + (b² -9) = 0.

But from above, t = (c + mb)/(1 + m²). Let me substitute this into the equation.

Let me denote t = (c + mb)/K, where K = 1 + m².

So, substitute into (1 + m²) t² - 2mb t + (b² -9) = 0:

K * [(c + mb)^2 / K²] - 2mb * (c + mb)/K + (b² -9) = 0.

Simplify:

[(c + mb)^2]/K - 2mb(c + mb)/K + (b² -9) = 0.

Combine terms:

[ (c + mb)^2 - 2mb(c + mb) ] / K + (b² -9) = 0.

Expand numerator:

(c + mb)^2 - 2mb(c + mb) = c² + 2cmb + m²b² - 2cmb - 2m²b² = c² - m²b².

So:

(c² - m²b²)/K + (b² -9) = 0.

But K = 1 + m², so:

(c² - m²b²)/(1 + m²) + (b² -9) = 0.

Multiply through by (1 + m²):

c² - m²b² + (b² -9)(1 + m²) = 0.

Expand the second term:

(b² -9) + (b² -9)m².

So overall:

c² - m²b² + b² -9 + (b² -
