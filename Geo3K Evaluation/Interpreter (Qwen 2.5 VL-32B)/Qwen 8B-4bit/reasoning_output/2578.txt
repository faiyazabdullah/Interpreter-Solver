Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines, some circles, and some length equalities. The main goal is to find the value of x, which is the length of Line(D,A). Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E, G. Then there are lines: Line(D,B) and Line(C,A). There's a circle involving point E, but I'm not sure yet how that comes into play. The intersection of Line(D,B) and Line(C,A) is point G. Also, there are several length equalities. 

Let me list out all the given equalities:

1. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)), x): This means that the length from D to A is x, which is what we need to find.
2. Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,A)), 24): So BA is 24 units long.
3. Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,A)), 9): CA is 9 units.
4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,G)), 12.25): CG is 12.25 units.
5. Equals(Mul(LengthOf(Line(D,A)), LengthOf(Line(D,B))), Mul(LengthOf(Line(C,A)), LengthOf(Line(C,G)))): This seems like an equation where the product of DA and DB equals the product of CA and CG. Since CA is 9 and CG is 12.25, their product is 9*12.25. And DA is x, so DB would be something we can relate.

So, the fifth equality gives us an equation: DA * DB = CA * CG. We know CA is 9, CG is 12.25, so their product is 9*12.25. Let me calculate that first. 12.25 times 9... Well, 12*9=108, and 0.25*9=2.25, so total is 110.25. Therefore, DA * DB = 110.25.

But DA is x, so x multiplied by DB equals 110.25. But we don't know DB yet. However, maybe we can find DB using other information?

Looking at the lines: Line(D,B) and Line(C,A) intersect at point G. So, points D, B, C, A are connected via these lines. Wait, Line(C,A) is one line, and Line(D,B) is another. Their intersection is point G. So, point G lies on both lines. That suggests that lines DA and CB? Or wait, Line(C,A) is from C to A, and Line(D,B) is from D to B. Their intersection is G. So, perhaps we can use the concept of intersecting lines and ratios?

Wait, since G is the intersection of Line(D,B) and Line(C,A), maybe we can use the section formula or similar triangles here. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help. Alternatively, using the concept of power of a point?

Alternatively, considering that G lies on both lines, so maybe there's a relation between segments created by the intersection. For example, if two lines intersect, then certain ratios hold. Like, if G divides Line(C,A) into CG and GA, and divides Line(D,B) into DG and GB. So, perhaps there's a proportionality here.

Given that, let me denote some variables. Let me assume that along Line(C,A), the segment from C to A is 9 units. Since G is a point on Line(C,A), then CG + GA = CA. Wait, but CG is given as 12.25. Wait, that can't be unless CA is longer than CG. Wait, CA is 9, but CG is 12.25? That would imply that G is beyond point A on the extension of Line(C,A)? Because if CG is longer than CA, then G is outside the segment CA. Hmm, that might be possible. Let me check.

So, if Line(C,A) has length 9, and CG is 12.25, then G is located such that starting from C, moving towards A, but going past A by some distance. So, CG = CA + AG. Which would mean AG = CG - CA = 12.25 - 9 = 3.25. So AG is 3.25 units. Therefore, the ratio of CG to GA would be 12.25 / 3.25. Let me compute that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 1.75: 12.25 ÷ 1.75 = 7, and 3.25 ÷ 1.75 ≈ 1.857. Wait, but maybe it's better to keep fractions. 12.25 is 49/4, and 3.25 is 13/4. So CG/GA = (49/4)/(13/4) = 49/13. So the ratio of CG to GA is 49:13.

Now, if lines CA and DB intersect at G, then by the theorem of intersecting lines, the products of the segments are proportional. Wait, more specifically, the theorem of intersecting lines (like the power of a point) says that for two lines intersecting at G, the product of the segments of one line equals the product of the segments of the other line. Wait, actually, that's the case when they are secant lines. Wait, but here, if G is the intersection point, then for line DB, the segments would be DG and GB, and for line CA, the segments are CG and GA. So according to the intersecting lines theorem (which is part of the power of a point), we have DG * GB = CG * GA. Wait, but that's only if the lines are secants of a circle. Wait, but maybe in general, when two lines intersect, the products of the segments aren't necessarily equal unless there's a circle involved. Wait, but the problem mentions a circle involving point E. Wait, the predicate is Circle(E), but I don't see how that connects directly yet. Maybe point E is the center of the circle? Or maybe it's a different point. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the lines are chords of the circle, but without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. Wait, but maybe the circle isn't directly relevant here. Let me focus again on the given equation from the problem. It states that Mul(LengthOf(Line(D,A)), LengthOf(Line(D,B))) equals Mul(LengthOf(Line(C,A)), LengthOf(Line(C,G))). So, DA * DB = CA * CG. From earlier, CA is 9, CG is 12.25, so DA * DB = 9 * 12.25 = 110.25. 

We need to find DA (x), so if we can express DB in terms of DA, then we can solve for x. How can we relate DB to DA? Let's consider the lines again. Points D and B are connected by Line(D,B), which passes through G. So, G is a point on DB. Therefore, DB is divided into DG and GB. So, DB = DG + GB. But we might need relations between DG and GB. 

Earlier, I considered the possibility that the intersecting lines satisfy DG * GB = CG * GA. Wait, but why would that be true? That would be the case if G were the intersection of two chords of a circle. But the problem mentions a circle with center E, but doesn't specify that the lines are chords. Unless point E is the center, and the lines pass through the circle. However, without explicit information about the circle's relation to the lines, I can't be sure. But since the problem includes the predicate Circle(E), maybe there's a connection here. But maybe I should proceed without assuming that, and instead rely on the given equation.

Wait, but the given equation is DA * DB = CA * CG. So, substituting the known values, DA * DB = 9 * 12.25 = 110.25. Therefore, x * DB = 110.25. But we need another equation relating DB and x. 

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles. Suppose that lines CA and DB intersect at G. Then, if there are similar triangles formed, we can set up proportions. Let me think. For instance, if triangles DGA and BGC are similar, but I need to verify if that's the case. 

To check similarity, we'd need corresponding angles to be equal. Since lines CA and DB intersect at G, vertically opposite angles would be equal. So, angle DGA is equal to angle BGC. If another pair of angles is equal, then the triangles would be similar. But without knowing if any sides are parallel, I can't assume that. 

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of mass point geometry or coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since Line(C,A) is from C to A, and CA is 9 units. Let me assign coordinates to C. Let me suppose that Line(C,A) is along the x-axis. So, point A is at (0,0), and point C is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me say point C is at (c, 0), and since CA is 9 units, then the distance between C and A is |c - 0| = 9, so c = 9 or -9. Let me choose c = 9 for simplicity, so C is at (9, 0). 

Then, point G is on Line(C,A), which is the x-axis. Earlier, we found that CG is 12.25, so since C is at (9, 0), and G is on the line extending from C through A. Wait, because CG is longer than CA (since CA is 9 and CG is 12.25). Therefore, G is beyond A from C. So, starting from C at (9,0), going through A at (0,0), then extending further. So, the coordinate of G would be such that the distance from C to G is 12.25. 

Since CA is 9 units, and CG is 12.25, then AG = CG - CA = 12.25 - 9 = 3.25 units. Therefore, point G is located 3.25 units away from A along the line CA extended beyond A. Since A is at (0,0), moving in the direction from C to A, which is towards negative x-direction. Wait, no—wait, the line CA goes from C to A. So, if we go from C to A, then extend beyond A. So, the direction from C to A is towards decreasing x-values. So, starting at C (9,0), moving towards A (0,0), then beyond to G. Therefore, the coordinate of G would be A minus (AG vector). Since AG is 3.25 units in the same direction from C to A. Wait, the direction from C to A is (-9, 0). So, unit vector in that direction is (-1, 0). Therefore, moving from A in that direction for AG length. Wait, AG is the distance from A to G. Since A is at (0,0), moving in the direction away from C (i.e., opposite direction of C to A), but since G is beyond A from C, it's in the direction from C through A to G. So, the coordinates of G would be A plus (direction from C to A) scaled by AG. Wait, maybe it's easier with coordinates.

From C (9,0) to A (0,0) is a vector of (-9, 0). The length of CA is 9. To get to G, which is 12.25 units from C, we move along that same line. So, starting at C (9,0), moving towards A (0,0) for 12.25 units. The entire length from C to A is 9 units, so moving 12.25 units from C would overshoot A by 12.25 - 9 = 3.25 units. Therefore, the coordinate of G would be A's coordinate minus (3.25 units in the direction from C to A). Wait, since moving from C to A is towards the left (negative x-direction), then moving beyond A by 3.25 units would be adding that to the left. So, starting at A (0,0), moving left (negative x) by 3.25 units. So, G's x-coordinate is 0 - 3.25 = -3.25. Therefore, G is at (-3.25, 0).

Now, we have coordinates for points C (9,0), A (0,0), G (-3.25, 0). Now, Line(D,B) passes through G. Let me find coordinates for D and B. But I don't have their coordinates yet. However, we know that DA is x, and DB is another variable. Let me think.

Point D is connected to B via Line(D,B), which passes through G. Let me assume coordinates for D and B. But since there's also a circle involving E, but I haven't used that yet. However, maybe I can find relations using the equation given: DA * DB = 110.25. 

Let me denote DA as x, which is the distance from D to A. Since A is at (0,0), if D is at some point (d_x, d_y), then DA^2 = d_x² + d_y² = x². But I don't know where D is. Similarly, B is another point; its position depends on Line(D,B) passing through G (-3.25, 0). 

Alternatively, since Line(D,B) passes through G, we can parametrize that line. Let me suppose that Line(D,B) has some slope, and passes through G. Let me think of coordinates for D and B. Let me assume that D is some arbitrary point, and B is another point such that line DB passes through G. But this might not be straightforward without more info.

Wait, but maybe using vectors or parametric equations. Let me think. Let me consider parametric equations for Line(D,B). Since G lies on this line, we can write parametric equations for the line through D and B, passing through G. Let me define parameters. Let me call t as parameter. Let me assume that G divides the segment DB in some ratio. Let me denote DG / GB = m/n. But without knowing that ratio, I can't proceed. However, maybe using the previous idea of the intersecting lines. 

Earlier, I thought about the possibility of DG * GB = CG * GA. But that was under the assumption that G is the intersection of two chords of a circle. Since the problem mentions a circle (Circle(E)), perhaps this applies here. If the lines DB and CA are chords of the circle passing through E, then yes, the power of point G with respect to the circle would give DG * GB = CG * GA. 

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point G outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments from G to the points of intersection with the circle is equal for any two lines through G. But if G is inside the circle, then the product would be negative, but since lengths are positive, it's the absolute value. 

However, in our case, if the lines DB and CA are chords of the circle, then the power of point G would be equal for both lines. Thus, DG * GB = CG * GA. 

So, if this holds, then DG * GB = CG * GA. We already calculated CG * GA as 12.25 * 3.25. Wait, earlier I said CG was 12.25, and GA was 3.25. Wait, CG is the length from C to G, which is 12.25. GA is the length from G to A, which is 3.25. Therefore, CG * GA = 12.25 * 3.25. Let me compute that. 

First, convert them to fractions. 12.25 is 49/4, and 3.25 is 13/4. Multiplying them: (49/4)*(13/4) = 637/16 = 39.8125. So DG * GB = 637/16. 

But according to the given equation from the problem, DA * DB = 9 * 12.25 = 110.25. Wait, but DA * DB = 110.25. 

But if DG * GB = 637/16 ≈ 39.8125, which is different from 110.25. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, either my assumption is wrong, or there's another relationship. 

Wait, but the given equation in the problem is DA * DB = CA * CG, which is 9 * 12.25 = 110.25. But if the Power of a Point theorem gives DG * GB = CG * GA, then those are separate equations. So, how do they connect?

Perhaps I need to combine these. Let me think. If DA * DB = 110.25, and DG * GB = 637/16 ≈ 39.8125, then maybe there's a way to relate DA and DB with DG and GB. 

But how? Let me note that DB is the entire length of the line from D to B, which includes DG and GB. So DB = DG + GB. However, DA is the length from D to A, and we need to relate that. 

But without knowing the exact positions of D and B, it's challenging. However, perhaps using coordinates again. Let me try again with coordinates. 

Assume A is at (0,0), C is at (9,0), G is at (-3.25, 0). Now, Line(D,B) passes through G. Let me parametrize Line(D,B). Let me suppose that D is at (d_x, d_y), and B is at (b_x, b_y). Both points D and B lie on a line that passes through G (-3.25, 0). 

Also, we know that DA is the distance from D to A, which is sqrt((d_x)^2 + (d_y)^2) = x. 

Additionally, we have the equation DA * DB = 110.25. So, DB is the distance from D to B, which is sqrt[(b_x - d_x)^2 + (b_y - d_y)^2] = DB. 

But this seems too abstract. Perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about vectors. 

Let me consider that G lies on both lines CA and DB. So, for line DB, G divides it into DG and GB. Let me denote DG = p and GB = q. Then, DB = p + q. Also, from the Power of a Point theorem (if applicable), DG * GB = CG * GA. As before, CG * GA = 12.25 * 3.25 = 39.8125. So, p*q = 39.8125. 

But from the given equation, DA * DB = 110.25. So, DA * (p + q) = 110.25. 

But DA is the length from D to A. How can I relate DA to p and q? 

Hmm. Let me think about triangle DGA. In triangle DGA, we have DA, DG, and GA. But we don't know the angles. However, if we can relate these using the Law of Cosines or something. 

Alternatively, since G is on line DB, and A is on line CA. Maybe using similar triangles. Let me consider triangles DGA and something else. 

Wait, if I look at triangle DGA and triangle something. Not sure. 

Alternatively, think of DA as part of the line from D to A, and DB as part of the line from D to B. Since G is on DB, then perhaps DA and DB are related through the position of G. 

Wait, but I need another equation. Let me think. If I can express DA in terms of DG and GA. But how? 

Wait, suppose we consider the coordinates again. Assume that A is at (0,0), G is at (-3.25, 0). Let me assume that D is some point, and B is another point such that G is on line DB. Let me pick coordinates for D and B. 

Let me suppose that line DB passes through G(-3.25, 0). Let me parametrize this line. Let me take a general line passing through G. Let me assume it has a slope m. Then, the parametric equations for line DB can be written as x = -3.25 + t, y = 0 + mt, where t is a parameter. 

Points D and B lie on this line. Let me say that D corresponds to parameter t = t_d and B corresponds to t = t_b. Then, the coordinates of D are (-3.25 + t_d, m*t_d), and coordinates of B are (-3.25 + t_b, m*t_b). 

The distance DA is the distance from D to A(0,0):

DA² = [(-3.25 + t_d) - 0]^2 + [m*t_d - 0]^2 
= (-3.25 + t_d)^2 + (m*t_d)^2 

Similarly, DB is the distance between D and B:

DB² = [(-3.25 + t_b) - (-3.25 + t_d)]² + [m*t_b - m*t_d]^2 
= [(t_b - t_d)]² + [m(t_b - t_d)]² 
= (t_b - t_d)^2 (1 + m²)

But this seems complicated. However, the given equation is DA * DB = 110.25. Squaring both sides:

DA² * DB² = (110.25)^2 

But DA² is (-3.25 + t_d)^2 + (m*t_d)^2, and DB² is (t_b - t_d)^2 (1 + m²). 

This seems too many variables. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, but earlier we had from the Power of a Point theorem that DG * GB = CG * GA. Assuming that this applies here (even though the problem didn't explicitly state that the lines are chords of the circle, but since there is a circle mentioned, maybe this is intended). 

So, DG * GB = CG * GA = 39.8125. 

Also, DA * DB = 110.25. 

Is there a way to relate DA and DB with DG and GB? Let me think. 

Let me consider that DA is the distance from D to A, and DB is the distance from D to B. Since G is on DB, we can express BG = DB - DG. Wait, no: if G is between D and B, then DG + GB = DB. But depending on where G is relative to D and B, it could vary. However, in our case, since G is the intersection of DB and CA, and CA extends beyond A, it's possible that G is between D and B, or outside. 

But from the earlier calculation, if we assume that G is between D and B, then DG + GB = DB. 

But without knowing the exact location, it's hard to tell. However, if we assume that G is between D and B, then DG * GB = 39.8125. 

But how does that help with DA * DB = 110.25? 

Maybe we need to relate DA with DG and GA? 

Alternatively, think of DA as part of the line from D to A, which intersects with line DB at G. Maybe using mass point geometry or Menelaus' theorem. 

Menelaus' theorem relates the ratios of segments when a transversal crosses the sides of a triangle. But I'm not sure if that applies here. 

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry again. Let me go back to the coordinate system where A is (0,0), C is (9,0), G is (-3.25, 0). Let me assume that line DB passes through G. Let me choose coordinates for D and B such that line DB passes through G. 

Suppose that D is at (a, b), and B is at (c, d). Then, since G lies on DB, the points D, G, B are colinear. So, the vector from D to G is proportional to the vector from G to B. 

So, (G - D) = k*(B - G) for some scalar k. 

So, coordinates:

G_x = -3.25 = a + k(c - a) ?

Wait, more accurately, the parametric form: G lies on line DB, so there exists a parameter t such that G = D + t*(B - D). 

Alternatively, the coordinates of G can be expressed as weighted average between D and B. 

Let me suppose that G divides DB in the ratio DG : GB = m:n. Then, coordinates of G are [(n*D + m*B)]/(m+n). 

But we know G's coordinates: (-3.25, 0). 

So, if I let DG : GB = m:n, then:

-3.25 = (n*D_x + m*B_x)/(m+n)
0 = (n*D_y + m*B_y)/(m+n)

But I don't know D or B. However, we also have the equation DA * DB = 110.25. 

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to make assumptions. 

Alternatively, since we have DA * DB = 110.25, and we need to find DA (x), perhaps we can express DB in terms of DA and other known quantities. 

But I still need another relation. Wait, maybe using the fact that G is on both lines CA and DB. Let me consider triangle DGA and something else. 

Alternatively, think about vectors. Vector DA is from D to A, which is A - D. Vector DB is B - D. But not sure. 

Wait, going back to the original equation: DA * DB = 9 * 12.25 = 110.25. 

So, if I can find DB in terms of DA, then substitute into this equation. 

But how? 

Let me think about the Power of a Point theorem again. If G is the intersection point, and if there is a circle, then DG * GB = CG * GA. As previously calculated, CG * GA = 12.25 * 3.25 = 39.8125. So, DG * GB = 39.8125. 

Now, if I can express DB in terms of DG and GB, which is DB = DG + GB. Let me denote DG = p, GB = q, so p * q = 39.8125, and DB = p + q. 

But how to relate this to DA? 

If I consider triangle DGA, where DA is the side from D to A, and GA is 3.25. But I don't know the angle between DA and GA. 

Wait, but if I assume that DA and DB are related through some geometric property. 

Alternatively, using Stewart's theorem on triangle DAB with cevian DG. Wait, but I don't know much about the triangle. 

Alternatively, since G is on CA, and we know the length from C to G and from G to A, perhaps using mass point or coordinate geometry to relate DA and DB. 

Wait, let me try coordinate geometry again. 

Let me assume that A is at (0,0), G is at (-3.25, 0), and C is at (9,0). 

Let me assume that line DB passes through G. Let me choose coordinates for D and B such that this is satisfied. 

Let me assume that D is at (0, y) and B is at (some point), but this may not work. 

Alternatively, let me choose D at (0, y) and B at (something). Wait, if D is at (0, y), then line DB goes from (0,y) to B, passing through G(-3.25, 0). Let me find coordinates of B. 

The line from D(0,y) to G(-3.25, 0) has slope m = (0 - y)/(-3.25 - 0) = (-y)/(-3.25) = y/3.25. 

So, the equation of the line DG is y = (y/3.25)(x - 0) + y? No, wait. Let me recompute. 

Wait, the line passes through D(0, y) and G(-3.25, 0). So, the slope is (0 - y)/(-3.25 - 0) = (-y)/(-3.25) = y/3.25. 

The equation of this line is y - y_D = m(x - x_D). So, y - y = m(x - 0), which simplifies to y = m*x. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the line passes through D(0, y) and G(-3.25, 0). So, the equation is:

(y - y_D) = m(x - x_D). Substituting D(0, y), it becomes y - y = m(x - 0) => 0 = mx, which is not helpful. Wait, I made a mistake. Let me redo.

Let me denote the line passing through D(0, y) and G(-3.25, 0). The slope m is (0 - y)/(-3.25 - 0) = y / 3.25. 

So, the equation of the line is: y - y_D = m(x - x_D). Here, y_D is the y-coordinate of D, which is y. So:

y - y = m(x - 0) → 0 = mx. That can't be right. Wait, no! Wait, the line passes through D(0, y) and G(-3.25, 0). Let me use two-point form. 

The line can be parametrized as follows. Let me use parameter t such that when t=0, it's at D(0, y), and t=1, it's at G(-3.25, 0). So, the parametric equations are:

x = 0 + t*(-3.25 - 0) = -3.25t

y = y + t*(0 - y) = y(1 - t)

So, at t=0, it's (0, y), and at t=1, it's (-3.25, 0). 

Now, point B is another point on this line. Let me say that B corresponds to t=k. So, coordinates of B are:

x_B = -3.25k

y_B = y(1 - k)

Now, DA is the distance from D(0, y) to A(0, 0), which is sqrt((0-0)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = |y|. So, DA = |y| = x. 

Now, DB is the distance from D(0, y) to B(-3.25k, y(1 - k)). 

Calculating DB² = (-3.25k - 0)^2 + [y(1 - k) - y]^2 

= (3.25k)^2 + [-yk]^2 

= (3.25²k²) + (y²k²) 

= k²(3.25² + y²)

Therefore, DB = k * sqrt(3.25² + y²)

Now, from the given equation DA * DB = 110.25. Substituting DA = |y| and DB = k * sqrt(3.25² + y²):

|y| * k * sqrt(3.25² + y²) = 110.25

But this seems complex. However, we also know that G is on line DB. What else can we derive?

Also, we can relate DG and GB. Since G is at t=1 on the parametric line from D to B, and B is at t=k. Wait, earlier, I defined t=0 at D and t=1 at G. So, if B is at t=k, then the parameter t ranges from 0 to k. Wait, but if k > 1, then B is beyond G from D. If k < 1, B is between D and G. 

But we also have from the Power of a Point theorem: DG * GB = CG * GA = 39.8125. 

DG is the length from D to G. Since G is at t=1, and D is at t=0, the length DG is the distance from D to G. 

In our parametrization, the parameter t scales the vector from D to G. The actual distance DG can be calculated. 

The vector from D to G is (-3.25, -y). So, DG = sqrt((-3.25)^2 + (-y)^2) = sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

Similarly, GB is the distance from G to B. Since B is at parameter t=k, and G is at t=1, the vector from G to B is (from t=1 to t=k). The parameter difference is Δt = k - 1. 

The length GB would be |Δt| times the length per unit parameter. The length per unit parameter is the length of the vector from D to G, which is sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

Wait, no. The parameter t is not necessarily normalized. Wait, in our parametrization, each increment of t corresponds to moving along the line from D to G. So, the total length from D to G is sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

So, if B is at parameter t=k, then the length from D to B is |k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²). Wait, no. Wait, the parameter t scales linearly with the parameter, but the actual distance depends on the scaling. 

Actually, the parameter t in this case is not a normalized parameter. It's just a linear interpolation. So, the actual distance from D to G is sqrt(3.25² + y²), and from D to B would depend on the parameter k. 

But I think this is getting too tangled. Let me try to find another way. 

Recall that we have DG * GB = 39.8125. 

DG is the length from D to G: sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

GB is the length from G to B. If B is at parameter t=k, then the vector from G to B is (x_B - x_G, y_B - y_G) = (-3.25k - (-3.25), y(1-k) - 0) = (-3.25(k-1), y(1 - k)).

So, the length GB is sqrt[(-3.25(k-1))^2 + (y(1 - k))^2] = |1 - k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

Thus, DG * GB = sqrt(3.25² + y²) * |1 - k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²) = (3.25² + y²) * |1 - k|.

This equals 39.8125. 

But from earlier, we also have DA * DB = 110.25. DA is |y|, and DB is the distance from D to B. 

The distance from D to B is sqrt[(-3.25k - 0)^2 + (y(1 - k) - y)^2] = sqrt[ (3.25k)^2 + (-yk)^2 ] = |k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

So, DA * DB = |y| * |k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²) = 110.25.

Now, we have two equations:

1. (3.25² + y²) * |1 - k| = 39.8125
2. |y| * |k| * sqrt(3.25² + y²) = 110.25

Let me denote S = sqrt(3.25² + y²). Then:

Equation 1: S * |1 - k| = 39.8125
Equation 2: |y| * |k| * S = 110.25

From Equation 1: |1 - k| = 39.8125 / S

From Equation 2: |y| * |k| = 110.25 / S

But also, S = sqrt(3.25² + y²). Let me square both sides of Equation 1: 

S² * (1 - k)^2 = (39.8125)^2 

But S² = 3.25² + y². So,

(3.25² + y²) * (1 - k)^2 = (39.8125)^2

And from Equation 2, |y| * |k| = 110.25 / S. Let me denote this as |y| * |k| = 110.25/S.

But this seems very complex. Let me try to find a relationship between these equations. 

Let me assume that k is positive, and 1 - k is positive, so k < 1. This would mean that B is between D and G. 

So, let's drop the absolute values and assume k < 1, so 1 - k is positive, and k is positive. 

So, Equation 1 becomes: S*(1 - k) = 39.8125 

Equation 2: y*k*S = 110.25 

But S = sqrt(3.25² + y²). 

Let me solve Equation 1 for S: S = 39.8125 / (1 - k)

Substitute into Equation 2: y*k*(39.8125 / (1 - k)) = 110.25 

=> y*k = 110.25 * (1 - k) / 39.8125 

Compute 110.25 / 39.8125. Let me calculate that. 

First, note that 39.8125 is approximately 39.8125 = 637/16 (since earlier calculation showed CG*GA = 637/16). Let me confirm: 637 divided by 16 is 39.8125. Yes. 

And 110.25 is 441/4. Let me check: 441/4 = 110.25. Yes. 

So, 110.25 / 39.8125 = (441/4) / (637/16) = (441/4) * (16/637) = (441 * 4) / 637 = 1764 / 637. Simplify this fraction. 

Divide numerator and denominator by 7: 1764 ÷ 7 = 252, 637 ÷ 7 = 91. So, 252/91. Can this be simplified further? Divide numerator and denominator by 7 again: 252 ÷ 7 = 36, 91 ÷ 7 = 13. So, 36/13. 

So, y*k = (36/13)*(1 - k). 

So, y*k = (36/13)(1 - k). 

But also, S = sqrt(3.25² + y²) = 39.8125 / (1 - k). 

Let me write 3.25 as 13/4. So, 3.25 = 13/4. 

So, S = sqrt((13/4)^2 + y²) = sqrt(169/16 + y²). 

So, sqrt(169/16 + y²) = 39.8125 / (1 - k). 

But 39.8125 = 637/16, so:

sqrt(169/16 + y²) = (637/16) / (1 - k) 

Square both sides:

169/16 + y² = (637²)/(16²) * 1/(1 - k)^2 

But this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find another way. 

From earlier, we have y*k = (36/13)(1 - k). Let me solve for y: y = (36/13)(1 - k)/k. 

Now, substitute this into S = sqrt(169/16 + y²) = 39.8125 / (1 - k). 

So:

sqrt(169/16 + [(36/13)(1 - k)/k]^2 ) = 637/16 / (1 - k)

Let me square both sides:

169/16 + [(36/13)^2 (1 - k)^2]/k² = (637^2)/(16^2) * 1/(1 - k)^2

This seems very complex, but perhaps there's a substitution. Let me let u = 1 - k. Then, k = 1 - u. 

But this might not help. Alternatively, let me multiply both sides by 16^2 to eliminate denominators. 

But this seems too tedious. Maybe there's a numerical approach. Let me try plugging in possible values for x. 

The answer choices are A.3, B.9, C.12.25, D.24. 

Let me test x = 3 (option A). If x = DA = 3, then DA = 3. 

From DA = |y| = 3, so y = ±3. Let me assume y = 3. 

Now, from Equation 2: y*k*S = 110.25. So, 3*k*S = 110.25 => k*S = 36.75. 

From Equation 1: S*(1 - k) = 39.8125. 

So, we have two equations: 

1. S*(1 - k) = 39.8125 
2. k*S = 36.75 

Let me divide equation 1 by equation 2: [S*(1 - k)]/[k*S] = 39.8125 / 36.75 → (1 - k)/k = 39.8125 / 36.75 ≈ 1.083333...

Calculate 39.8125 / 36.75: 

Convert to decimals: 39.8125 ÷ 36.75 ≈ 1.083333... which is 1 + 1/12 ≈ 1.083333...

Which is 13/12. 

So, (1 - k)/k = 13/12 → 1/k - 1 = 13/12 → 1/k = 25/12 → k = 12/25 = 0.48. 

Then, from equation 2: k*S = 36.75 → S = 36.75 / 0.48 = 76.5625. 

But S is sqrt(169/16 + y²) = sqrt(169/16 + 9) = sqrt(169/16 + 144/16) = sqrt(313/16) ≈ sqrt(19.5625) ≈ 4.423. But 76.5625 is way larger than this. Contradiction. So x=3 is not correct. 

Next, try option B: x=9. 

If x=9, then DA = 9, so |y|=9 → y=±9. Let's take y=9
