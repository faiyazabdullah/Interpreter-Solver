MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A) which forms triangle ABC. Then there's Line(A,D), Line(D,B), so point D is connected to A and B. Also, Line(A,E) and Line(E,C). And some measurements given: DB is 24 units, AE is 3, EC is 18. And they mention that adding AE and EC gives AC. Wait, so AE + EC equals AC? That suggests that points A, E, C are colinear? Because if you add AE and EC, that would mean E is between A and C. So AC is the sum of AE and EC, which are 3 and 18, making AC = 21. 

So first, I need to visualize or sketch the diagram. Let me think. Triangle ABC with points A, B, C. Point D connected to A and B, so maybe forming another triangle or something. Then point E connected to A and C. Since AE is 3 and EC is 18, E is somewhere along AC such that AE=3 and EC=18. Therefore, AC must be 21. 

Now, the question is asking for AD. We know DB is 24. Hmm. How do these points relate? Let me see. Points D is connected to A and B. Maybe triangle ABD? Or perhaps there's a way to use coordinates here. Maybe coordinate geometry could work. Let me consider assigning coordinates to the points to calculate distances.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0,0) for simplicity. Then since AC is 21 units long, and E divides AC into AE=3 and EC=18, so E is 3 units from A towards C. But where is point C? Let me assume coordinates for C. Let me suppose that AC lies along the x-axis. So if A is at (0,0), then C would be at (21,0), because AC is 21. Then E, being 3 units from A, would be at (3,0).

Wait, but then point B is part of triangle ABC. Let me think about triangle ABC. Points A(0,0), B somewhere, C(21,0). Now, there's also point D connected to A and B. So D is connected to A and B. Also, line DB has length 24. So BD = 24. 

But how does point D relate to other points? Maybe it's part of triangle ABD? Not sure yet. Also, point E is connected to A and C, which we've placed as (0,0) and (21,0). 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between D and E? Not directly stated. Let me check the given lines again. The lines are AB, BC, CA (so triangle ABC), AD, DB, AE, EC. So D is connected to A and B, E is connected to A and C. 

Perhaps triangle ABD? Let me consider coordinates again. Suppose I assign coordinates to B. Let me assume coordinates for B. Let me say point B has coordinates (x,y). Then, since AB is a line, and BC connects B to C(21,0). Also, line AD connects A(0,0) to D. But we don't know where D is yet. However, BD is 24 units. So point D is somewhere such that distance from B to D is 24. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between points D and E? For example, is D lying on some line related to E? Not sure. 

Wait, but maybe triangle ABD and triangle something else? Alternatively, since AE is 3 and EC is 18, maybe there's a ratio involved. Like, E divides AC into a ratio of 1:6 (since 3:18 = 1:6). Maybe mass point geometry? Or Menelaus' theorem?

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A and C, maybe we can express coordinates for B and D. Let me proceed with coordinates. 

Let me fix coordinates:

Set A at (0,0), C at (21,0). Then E is at (3,0). 

Now, let me denote coordinates for B as (p, q). Then, since B is connected to C(21,0), the line BC connects (p,q) to (21,0). Also, line AB connects A(0,0) to B(p,q). 

Then, point D is connected to A(0,0) and B(p,q). So line AD connects A(0,0) to D, and line DB connects D to B(p,q). The length of DB is 24. 

We need to find AD. 

But how can we relate this? Well, if we can find coordinates for D, then compute AD. But how? 

Since D is on line AB? Wait, no. Wait, line AD is given, but D is connected to A and B. Wait, line AD is one line, and line DB is another. So D is connected to A and B, implying that D lies somewhere such that it's connected to both A and B. So line AD and line BD form two sides of a triangle ABD. Wait, but without knowing more about D, like whether it's on AB or not. Wait, line AD exists, so D is a point connected to A and B. So D is not necessarily on AB. It could be anywhere, but connected via lines AD and BD. 

Hmm. So, the position of D is arbitrary except that the distance from D to B is 24. But how can we find AD? 

Wait, unless there's another condition. Let me check the given predicates again. Are there any other lines or constraints? There's also Line(A,E) and Line(E,C). So E is connected to A and C, which we already considered. 

Is there any other relations? The problem mentions Triangle(A,B,C), so ABC is a triangle. But we don't know its type. 

But perhaps there's something about triangle ABD? Let me think. Without more info, maybe coordinate geometry is still the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or parametric equations. Let me try coordinates again. 

Suppose point D has coordinates (x,y). Since D is connected to A(0,0) and B(p,q). So line AD goes from (0,0) to (x,y), and line DB goes from (x,y) to (p,q). The length of DB is 24. Also, we need to find AD, which is sqrt(x² + y²). 

But we need more equations to solve for x and y. What else do we know? 

Well, point E is connected to A and C, which we have coordinates for. Is there a connection between D and E? Not directly stated. Unless there's a hidden relationship. 

Wait, but the problem says "Add(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), LengthOf(Line(E,C)), LengthOf(Line(A,C)))" which we interpreted as AE + EC = AC, which confirms that E is between A and C. So that's settled. 

But how does D come into play? Maybe there's a property involving D? For instance, if D lies on some line related to E? Not sure. 

Wait, maybe triangle ABD is similar to another triangle? Or maybe using the Law of Cosines or something? 

Alternatively, perhaps considering coordinates for B. Let me think. Let me assume coordinates for B. Let me choose coordinates such that calculations are easier. 

For example, suppose triangle ABC is arbitrary, but with AC = 21. Let me pick coordinates for B. Let me choose B at (0, b) for simplicity. Wait, but then AB would be vertical. Let me try that. 

Let me set A at (0,0), C at (21,0), and B at (0, h), so that AB is vertical. Then, coordinates for B are (0,h). Then, line AB is from (0,0) to (0,h). Then, line BC connects (0,h) to (21,0). 

Now, point D is connected to A(0,0) and B(0,h). So line AD connects A(0,0) to D, and line BD connects D to B(0,h). The length of BD is 24. Let me find coordinates for D. 

Let me parameterize D. Since D is connected to A and B, maybe it's on AB? But if D were on AB, then AD + DB = AB. But BD is given as 24. However, AB's length would be h. So if D is on AB, then AD + DB = AB. But since we don't know h, this may not help. But maybe D isn't on AB. 

Alternatively, D could be anywhere else. Let me suppose D has coordinates (x, y). Then, since D is connected to A(0,0) and B(0,h). So line AD is from (0,0) to (x,y), and line BD is from (x,y) to (0,h). The distance BD is sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y - h)^2) = sqrt(x² + (y-h)^2) = 24. 

Also, we need to find AD, which is sqrt(x² + y²). 

But we have only one equation here. So unless there's more constraints, we can't determine x and y uniquely. So maybe there's another condition? 

Wait, are there other lines mentioned? Line(A,D) and Line(D,B) are given, but that's already accounted for. Also, Line(A,E) and Line(E,C) are given. So E is at (3,0) as before. Is there any relation between D and E? 

Not directly stated. Unless there's an intersection or something. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any other conditions. So maybe my assumption of coordinates is missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD relates to triangle something else? 

Wait, but maybe there's a different approach. Let me recall that in the given, AE = 3, EC = 18, so AC = 21. If we can find some ratios or similar triangles. 

Another thought: Perhaps using Stewart’s theorem? Since we have a cevian? Wait, but what cevian? If D is connected to B, but not sure. 

Wait, let me think. Suppose we consider triangle ABC with point E on AC, and point D connected to A and B. But without knowing where D is located, it's hard to apply Stewart's theorem. 

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates again but choosing specific values for B. Let me make some assumptions to simplify. 

Let me assume that triangle ABC is a right triangle. For example, suppose ABC is a right triangle at A. So A(0,0), B(0,b), C(c,0). Then AC = c = 21. So c = 21. Then E is at (3,0). 

Then, point D is connected to A(0,0) and B(0,b). Let me assume D lies somewhere in the plane. The distance from D to B is 24. Let me write coordinates for D as (x,y). Then BD^2 = x² + (y - b)^2 = 24². Also, AD^2 = x² + y². So AD^2 = BD^2 - (y - b)^2 + y²? Wait, expanding BD^2:

BD² = x² + (y - b)^2 = x² + y² - 2b y + b² = (AD²) - 2b y + b². 

So BD² = AD² - 2b y + b². 

But without knowing b or y, this seems stuck. 

But maybe there's another condition. Wait, what about line AD? Is there any relation between AD and other elements? 

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Vector AD is from A to D, vector BD is from B to D. But again, not enough info. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between E and D? For example, if D lies on BE or something? No, not stated. 

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement. Are there any other lines or points? The given lines are AB, BC, CA (triangle ABC), AD, DB, AE, EC. So no other lines. 

So maybe the problem requires assuming that D lies on a certain line? For example, if D is on AB extended, then AD + DB = AB, but we don't know AB's length. 

Alternatively, if D is on BC? No, because there's no line DC given. 

Wait, but there's line AD and DB. So D is connected to A and B, but not necessarily lying on AB. 

This seems too vague. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the given data. 

Given that Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)), 24), Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 3), Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 18). Also, Add(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), LengthOf(Line(E,C)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))). Which tells us AC = AE + EC = 21. 

But how to connect D to these? Maybe using triangle similarity or something. 

Wait, maybe considering triangle ADB and triangle something else. 

Alternatively, since we have AE=3 and EC=18, which is 1:6 ratio. Could there be a median or centroid? But D is connected to B, not sure. 

Wait, perhaps using mass point geometry. If E divides AC into AE:EC = 1:6, then masses at A and C would be 6 and 1 respectively. But how does that relate to D? 

Alternatively, think of D as being related to B and E somehow. 

Wait, maybe there's a parallelogram? If AD is parallel to something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, think of coordinates again. Let me try to assign coordinates with specific numbers. 

Assume A(0,0), C(21,0), E(3,0). Let me choose B at (0, b) for simplicity. Then, AB is vertical. 

Now, point D is connected to A(0,0) and B(0,b). Let me assume that D lies somewhere in the plane. The distance from D to B is 24. Let me denote D as (x, y). Then, BD^2 = x² + (y - b)^2 = 24². 

But we need another equation to find AD. Wait, but unless there's a constraint that links D to E. 

Unless D lies on BE? Let me check. If D is on BE, then we can parametrize D's coordinates. 

Let me find coordinates of E, which is (3,0), and B is (0,b). The line BE connects (0,b) to (3,0). Parametric equations: x = 3t, y = b - bt, where t ranges from 0 to 1. 

If D is on BE, then coordinates of D would be (3t, b(1 - t)). Then, distance from D to B is sqrt[(3t - 0)^2 + (b(1-t) - b)^2] = sqrt[9t² + (-bt)^2] = t*sqrt(9 + b²). This should equal 24. So t*sqrt(9 + b²) = 24 → t = 24 / sqrt(9 + b²). 

Meanwhile, AD is the distance from A(0,0) to D(3t, b(1-t)) which is sqrt[(3t)^2 + (b(1-t))^2]. Let me compute that:

AD² = 9t² + b²(1 - t)^2 = 9t² + b²(1 - 2t + t²) = 9t² + b² - 2b²t + b²t² = (9 + b²)t² - 2b²t + b². 

But we have t = 24 / sqrt(9 + b²). Let me substitute that into AD²:

Let me denote s = sqrt(9 + b²). Then t = 24/s. 

So AD² becomes (9 + b²)(24/s)^2 - 2b²*(24/s) + b². 

But s² = 9 + b², so substituting:

First term: (s²)*(24²)/s² = 24² = 576

Second term: -2b²*(24/s)

Third term: b²

Thus AD² = 576 - (48b²)/s + b² = 576 + b²(1 - 48/s). 

But this seems complicated unless we can find b. 

However, we don't know the value of b. But maybe there's another condition? For example, what about the triangle ABC? Since ABC is a triangle with points A(0,0), B(0,b), C(21,0). So AB has length sqrt(0² + b²) = b, AC is 21, and BC is sqrt((21 - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2) = sqrt(441 + b²). 

But there's no information about the other sides or angles. So unless there's more constraints, we cannot determine b. Hence, this approach might not be helpful. 

Maybe I need to consider that the problem is solvable with the given data, suggesting that AD can be determined regardless of other variables. So perhaps there's a property or theorem that I haven't considered yet. 

Wait, let me think again about the given lengths. AE = 3, EC = 18. So AC = 21. DB = 24. Need to find AD. 

Is there a possibility that triangle ADE or something is similar to another triangle? 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD? But without knowing angles or other sides, it's tricky. 

Wait, but maybe triangle ABD and triangle something else? Let me think. 

Wait, since E is on AC, and we know AE and EC, maybe there's a way to relate D to E through some proportionality. 

Alternatively, consider vectors. Let me define vectors for points. 

Let me take A as origin. So vector A is (0,0). Vector C is (21,0). Vector E is (3,0). Let me denote vector B as (p, q). 

Vector D is some point connected to A and B. So vector D can be expressed as a linear combination? Not sure. 

Wait, if D is on line AB, then vector D = A + k*(B - A) = k*B, since A is origin. So D would be (kp, kq). Then BD would be |D - B| = |k*B - B| = |(k-1)*B|. So length BD = |k-1| * |B|. Given that BD = 24, then |k-1| * |B| = 24. Also, AD is |D| = |k| * |B|. So AD = |k| * |B|. 

But we need to find AD. However, we don't know k or |B|. But maybe there's a way to link this with E? 

But how? 

Alternatively, if D is not on AB, then this approach won't work. 

Wait, but if D is on AB, then AD + DB = AB. So if BD = 24, then AD = AB - 24. But AB is the length from A to B, which we don't know. However, maybe we can find AB using other information? 

No, because we don't have other lengths related to AB. 

Alternatively, if D is not on AB, then we can't make that assumption. 

Hmm. This seems to be going in circles. 

Wait, but the answer options are numerical values: 3, 4, 6, 8. Maybe AD is one of these. Let me think of possible scenarios where AD is one of these. 

Suppose AD is 6. Then, if D is somewhere such that BD = 24. Let me imagine a scenario where AD = 6 and BD = 24. For example, if A, D, B form a straight line with AD = 6 and DB = 24, then AB would be 30. But then AC is 21. Not sure how that helps. 

Alternatively, if triangle ABD is a right triangle. Let me assume that angle at A is right. Then AD and AB are perpendicular. But without knowing AB, this is speculative. 

Wait, another idea: Maybe using the concept of similar triangles with AE and EC. Since AE/EC = 1/6, and if there's a transversal or something. 

Wait, if there's a line through D intersecting AC at E? But not sure. 

Wait, let me think of mass point geometry. If E divides AC in ratio AE:EC = 1:6, then masses at A and C would be 6 and 1. But how does this relate to D? If D is on AB, then masses at A and B would relate to... Hmm, but I don't see a direct connection. 

Alternatively, if D is on BC? But there's no line DC given. 

Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry with specific values. Let me assume AB is horizontal or something. 

Let me try setting A at (0,0), C at (21,0), E at (3,0). Let me choose B at (0, 12) for simplicity. Then AB is from (0,0) to (0,12), length AB = 12. Now, let me find D such that BD = 24. 

Let me assume D is somewhere in the plane. Let me suppose D is on AB extended. If D is on AB extended beyond B, then AD = AB + BD. But AB is 12, BD is 24, so AD = 12 + 24 = 36. But 36 isn't among the options. So this might not be the case. 

Alternatively, if D is on AB extended beyond A. Then AD would be negative, but length is positive. If AD is from A to D, and D is on AB extended beyond A, then AD = |AB - BD|? Not sure. 

Wait, if B is at (0,12), and D is somewhere such that BD = 24. Let me choose D at (0, 12 + 24) = (0,36), so that BD is vertical line from (0,12) to (0,36), length 24. Then AD is from (0,0) to (0,36), which is 36. Again, not matching answer choices. 

Alternatively, D is not on AB. Let me choose D somewhere else. For example, if D is at (x, y) such that distance from B(0,12) is 24. Let me choose x=24, y=12. Then BD is distance from (0,12) to (24,12) is 24, which satisfies. Then AD is distance from (0,0) to (24,12): sqrt(24² + 12²) = sqrt(576 + 144) = sqrt(720) ≈ 26.83, which is not in the options. 

Hmm. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe the answer is 6, which is one of the options. How can I get 6? Let me think of a scenario where AD = 6 and BD = 24. For example, if triangle ABD has AD = 6, BD = 24, and angle between them θ. Then AB² = 6² + 24² - 2*6*24*cosθ. But without knowing θ, can't determine AB. 

Alternatively, if angle ABD is right angle, then AB² = AD² + BD² = 36 + 576 = 612, so AB = sqrt(612) ≈ 24.74. Still not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe there's a right triangle involving AD and AE? For example, if AD is perpendicular to AE? Not sure. 

Wait, AE is 3 units, and EC is 18. Maybe there's a right triangle with legs 3 and 18? But that would give hypotenuse 3√(1 + 36) = 3√37, which isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe using Pythagoras in some way. For example, if AD is one leg, and something else is another. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think differently. Since AC = 21, and AE = 3, EC = 18, maybe there's a relation between AD and DB through some theorem. 

Wait, what if D is the foot of the altitude from B to AC? Then, but AC is horizontal from (0,0) to (21,0). If B is at (x,y), then the foot of the altitude from B to AC would be (x,0). Then, distance from B to this foot is y. But DB would be the length from D to B, which would be y. But given DB is 24, then y = 24. Then AD would be the distance from A(0,0) to D(x,0), which is |x|. But how to find x? 

But x is the x-coordinate of the foot of the altitude from B to AC. In this case, x depends on the position of B. For example, if B is at (p, q), then the foot of the altitude from B to AC (which is x-axis) is (p, 0). So AD would be |p|, and DB would be q. Given DB = 24, so q = 24. But we don't know p. So AD could be any value depending on p. Hence, this approach also doesn't yield a unique answer. 

Wait, but maybe there's more information about triangle ABC? Like, if it's a right triangle? For example, if ABC is right-angled at B, then AC would be the hypotenuse. AC = 21, so AB² + BC² = 21². But without knowing AB or BC, this is still not helpful. 

I'm running out of ideas. Let me revisit the problem statement for any missed clues. 

The problem states that there is a Line(A,E), Line(E,C), and adds their lengths to get AC. So E is on AC. Also, there's Line(A,D) and Line(D,B). So D is connected to A and B. 

Wait, could there be a parallelogram involved? For example, if AD is parallel to EC or something? Not sure. 

Wait, another idea: Since AE = 3 and EC = 18, and AC = 21, maybe using section formula or coordinate geometry with E as a reference. 

Let me consider placing E at (0,0) for simplicity. Wait, but earlier I had A at (0,0). Let me try a different coordinate setup. 

Let me set E at (0,0), since it's a point dividing AC into 3 and 18. Then, A is 3 units away from E, and C is 18 units away from E. So let me set E at (0,0), A at (-3, 0), and C at (18, 0). Then AC is from (-3,0) to (18,0), total length 21. 

Now, point B is somewhere, and lines AB, BC, CA form triangle ABC. Also, Line(A,D) and Line(D,B) exist, with DB = 24. Need to find AD. 

Now, let me define coordinates for B. Let me say B is at (p, q). Then, line AB connects A(-3,0) to B(p,q). Line BC connects B(p,q) to C(18,0). 

Point D is connected to A and B, so line AD connects A(-3,0) to D, and line DB connects D to B(p,q). Distance DB = 24. Need to find AD. 

Let me denote D as a point such that it is connected to A and B. Let me parameterize D. Let me assume D lies on line AB. Then, D would be somewhere on AB. Let me parameterize AB. 

Parametric equations for AB: Starting at A(-3,0) and ending at B(p,q). Let me represent D as a point on AB: D = A + t*(B - A) = (-3 + t(p + 3), 0 + t(q - 0)) = (-3 + t(p+3), tq). 

Then, distance from D to B is |BD|. Let me compute BD. 

Coordinates of B: (p, q). Coordinates of D: (-3 + t(p+3), tq). 

So vector BD is (p - (-3 + t(p+3)), q - tq) = (p + 3 - t(p+3), q(1 - t)). 

Length BD squared is [p + 3 - t(p+3)]² + [q(1 - t)]² = 24² = 576. 

Expand the first term: [ (p+3)(1 - t) ]² + [ q(1 - t) ]² = (1 - t)^2 [ (p+3)^2 + q^2 ] = 576. 

Note that (p+3)^2 + q^2 is the square of AB's length. Let me call AB = m, so m² = (p+3)^2 + q^2. 

So, (1 - t)^2 * m² = 576 → (1 - t)^2 = 576/m² → 1 - t = ±24/m → t = 1 ∓ 24/m. 

Now, AD is the distance from A to D. Since D is on AB, AD = t * AB. Because t is the fraction from A to B. 

Wait, no: If D = A + t*(B - A), then the length AD is t times the length of AB. Wait, no: if t is between 0 and 1, then AD = t * AB. But if t > 1, it's beyond B. 

So, AD = |t| * AB. 

But we need to find AD. Let me express AD in terms of m and t. 

From above, t = 1 ∓ 24/m. 

So AD = |t| * m. 

But we need to determine t. 

However, we don't know m (the length of AB). But perhaps there's a way to relate m to other parts? 

Wait, but what about point C? C is at (18,0). Let me compute BC. Coordinates of B(p,q) and C(18,0). Length BC is sqrt[(18 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = sqrt[(18-p)^2 + q^2]. 

But there's no information about BC. So again, stuck. 

But wait, in this coordinate system, AC is from (-3,0) to (18,0), so AC = 21. But what about other sides? 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between AB and BC? Not specified. 

This approach also seems to lead nowhere. 

At this point, I realize that I might be overcomplicating things. Let me think about the answer choices. The options are 3, 4, 6, 8. Given that AE is 3 and EC is 18, and DB is 24, maybe there's a proportional relationship. 

Wait, AE : EC = 1 : 6. If there's a similar triangle where AD corresponds to AE or something. 

Suppose there's a triangle where AD corresponds to AE, and DB corresponds to EC or something. But not sure. 

Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles with the given ratios. 

Let me imagine that triangles AED and something are similar. 

Alternatively, since AE = 3 and EC = 18, which is 1:6, and DB = 24, which is 24. Maybe AD is 24 * (something). 

Wait, if I think of AE/EC = 1/6, and if AD/DB = 1/6, then AD = 24 * (1/6) = 4. Which is option B. But why would AD/DB = AE/EC? 

That would require some proportionality, like in similar triangles or sections. 

But why would AD/DB = AE/EC? Let me think. If there's a transversal cutting across lines, but I need justification. 

Alternatively, if D is on a line that creates a proportion similar to AE/EC. 

Wait, if E is on AC, and D is on AB, then by the converse of the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), if DE is parallel to BC, then AE/EC = AD/DB. 

Ah! This could be the key. 

If DE is parallel to BC, then by Thales' theorem, AE/EC = AD/DB. 

Given that, let's check: 

AE = 3, EC = 18 → AE/EC = 1/6. 

If DE || BC, then AD/DB = 1/6 → AD = (1/6) * DB = (1/6)*24 = 4. 

Which is option B. 

But how do we know that DE is parallel to BC? 

Because the problem didn't state that explicitly. But perhaps it's implied by the configuration of the lines? 

Wait, the problem includes Line(A,E) and Line(E,C), which means E is on AC. Also, Line(A,D) and Line(D,B), which implies D is connected to A and B. If DE is parallel to BC, then this would satisfy the condition. 

But how can we confirm that DE is parallel to BC? 

Well, if we assume that DE || BC, then we can derive AD/DB = AE/EC. 

But why would DE be parallel to BC? Because the problem might be constructed in such a way that this is true. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a reason for this proportionality. 

In many geometry problems, especially those involving ratios on sides of triangles, parallel lines are often used to create such proportions. 

Given that the answer choices include 4, and this derivation leads to it, it's plausible. 

Therefore, assuming DE || BC, we get AD = 4. 

Hence, the answer is B.
