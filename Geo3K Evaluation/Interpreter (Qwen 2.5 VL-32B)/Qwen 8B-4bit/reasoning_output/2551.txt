MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of XY given some other lengths and right angles. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, the points mentioned are X, M, N, Y, Z. There are several lines connecting them: X-Y, Y-Z, X-Z, X-M, M-N, N-Z, M-Y, and also N-Z again. Then there are triangles: Triangle(X,M,Y), Triangle(N,M,Z), and Triangle(X,Y,Z). Also, there are right angles at Angle(X,M,Y) and Angle(N,M,Z). The lengths given are XM=4, XN=6, NZ=9. Plus, there are some relationships about points lying on lines, like M and N being on line XZ. 

So, the main goal is to find XY. Let me try to visualize this. Since points M and N are on line XZ, that suggests that X, M, N, Z are colinear? Wait, but the lines listed include X-Z, so maybe X-M-N-Z are all on the same straight line? But wait, there's also lines like X-M, M-N, N-Z, so yes, they form a straight line from X through M to N to Z. Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ) and PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ), so M and N are on line XZ. Therefore, X---M---N---Z along the line XZ. 

Now, given that XM=4, XN=6, and NZ=9. Let me note that. So from point X to M is 4 units, from X to N is 6 units, so MN would be XN - XM = 6 - 4 = 2 units. Then from N to Z is 9 units. Therefore, the total length XZ is XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15 units. 

But also, since M and N are on XZ, the entire line XZ has points X, M, N, Z in order. Now, looking at the triangles given. Triangle(X,M,Y) has a right angle at M, because RightAngle(Angle(X,M,Y)). Similarly, Triangle(N,M,Z) has a right angle at M. So, those two triangles are right-angled at M. 

Let me sketch mentally. For Triangle(X,M,Y): right-angled at M, so sides XM and MY are perpendicular. Similarly, Triangle(N,M,Z) is right-angled at M, so sides NM and MZ are perpendicular. 

Wait, but how do these triangles relate to each other? Also, there's Triangle(X,Y,Z), which is probably connected through these points. 

Since we have points X, Y, Z forming a triangle, and we need to find XY. Maybe we can use coordinates to model this? Assign coordinates to the points and compute distances?

Yes, coordinate geometry could work here. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point X at the origin (0,0). Since line XZ is a straight line, and points M and N lie on it. Let me assume that line XZ is horizontal for simplicity. 

So, if X is at (0,0), and line XZ is horizontal, then points M and N are along the x-axis. Given that XM = 4, so point M is at (4, 0). Then XN = 6, so point N is at (6, 0). Then NZ = 9, so since N is at (6, 0), Z would be at (6 + 9, 0) = (15, 0). Thus, the coordinates would be:

X: (0,0)

M: (4,0)

N: (6,0)

Z: (15,0)

Now, we need to find coordinates for Y such that Triangle(X,M,Y) is right-angled at M, and Triangle(N,M,Z) is right-angled at M. Wait, but Triangle(N,M,Z) has right angle at M. That means that vectors MN and MZ are perpendicular. Wait, but MN is from M to N, which is (6-4, 0-0) = (2,0). And MZ is from M to Z, which is (15-4, 0-0) = (11, 0). These are both along the x-axis, so they are colinear, hence not perpendicular. Wait, this seems conflicting. How can Triangle(N,M,Z) be right-angled at M if MN and MZ are colinear? That would mean the angle at M is 180 degrees, which isn't a right angle. There's something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the triangles. Let me check the predicates again. The Triangle(N,M,Z) has right angle at M. So, the right angle is at M, so the legs would be NM and ZM. But in our current setup, NM is along the x-axis from N to M (from (6,0) to (4,0)) which is vector (-2,0), and ZM is from Z to M, which is (4-15, 0-0)=(-11,0). Both vectors are along the negative x-axis, so they are colinear. Hence, angle at M is 180 degrees, which contradicts the right angle. So my assumption that all points are on the same line must be incorrect? Or perhaps my coordinate assignment is flawed.

Wait, but according to the given predicates, PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ) and PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ). So both M and N are on line XZ, which implies that X, M, N, Z are colinear. However, the presence of right angles in both triangles (X,M,Y) and (N,M,Z) at M suggests that the segments MX and MY are perpendicular, and also NM and MZ are perpendicular. But if MX and NM are both along the same line (since M is on XZ), then MY and MZ would have to be perpendicular to that line. Wait, but in that case, MY and MZ would be vertical lines if XZ is horizontal. Let me think again.

Let me re-examine the triangles. For Triangle(X,M,Y) with right angle at M: This implies that angle at M is 90 degrees. So, the sides adjacent to M are XM and YM, and they are perpendicular. Similarly, Triangle(N,M,Z) with right angle at M: the sides adjacent to M are NM and ZM, which should be perpendicular. But since M lies on XZ, which is a straight line, then NM and XM are parts of the same line. Therefore, if XM and YM are perpendicular, then YM is perpendicular to XZ. Similarly, for Triangle(N,M,Z), NM and ZM are parts of XZ, so they are colinear. Hence, unless ZM is considered as a different direction... Wait, no, because NM and ZM are segments from M to N and from M to Z, which are both along XZ. Therefore, they are colinear, making the angle at M between NM and ZM as 180 degrees, not 90. Contradiction. So where is the error here?

Ah! Wait, maybe the triangles are not as I thought. Let me check the predicates again. The Triangle(N,M,Z) is given. So the three vertices are N, M, Z. The right angle is at M. So in triangle N-M-Z, the right angle is at M. Therefore, the legs are NM and ZM. But since N, M, Z are colinear (as per the PointLiesOnLine(N,XZ)), then NM and ZM are colinear, making the angle at M 180 degrees, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Which suggests that either my interpretation of the points' arrangement is wrong, or there's another configuration.

Wait, perhaps the line XZ is not straight? No, the predicates say Line(X,Z) exists, so XZ is a straight line. Points M and N are on line XZ, so they are colinear with X and Z. Therefore, the issue remains. How can there be a right angle at M in triangle N-M-Z?

This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption that X, M, N, Z are colinear is incorrect. Wait, but the predicates state PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ) and PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ), so they must be on the same line. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line XZ is not straight? But that can't be, since Line(X,Z) is defined. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles are not using the line segments as I thought. Let me look again. The Triangle(N,M,Z) has sides NM, MZ, and NZ. But if N, M, Z are colinear, then the triangle would collapse into a line. So how can that be a valid triangle? Unless the points are not colinear. But the predicates say that N lies on line XZ and M lies on line XZ, so N and M are on XZ. Therefore, N, M, Z are colinear. So triangle N-M-Z cannot exist as a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the line XZ is not the same as the line containing points N and M? But the predicates say that both M and N are on line XZ. So line XZ contains points X, M, N, Z. Therefore, N-M-Z are colinear, making triangle N-M-Z degenerate. But the predicate says Triangle(N,M,Z) exists. This is a contradiction. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the line names. For example, Line(X,Z) is one line, but Line(N,Z) is another line. Wait, the predicates mention Line(N,Z) twice. Wait, the original list includes Line(X,Z), Line(N,Z), etc. So perhaps the line XZ is different from the line NZ? No, Line(X,Z) is the same as Line(N,Z) if Z is a common point. Wait, but if N is on line XZ, then Line(N,Z) is part of Line(X,Z). So the triangle N-M-Z would require that N, M, Z are not colinear. But since M is on line XZ, and N is on line XZ, then M and N are on the same line as Z, so N, M, Z are colinear. Hence, triangle N-M-Z is degenerate. This is a problem.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Perhaps the line NZ is not the same as line XZ? Wait, but the predicate says Line(N,Z) is present, and Line(X,Z) is present. So if N is on line XZ, then Line(N,Z) is part of Line(X,Z). Therefore, the triangle N-M-Z would still be degenerate. Hence, the only way for Triangle(N,M,Z) to exist is if M is not on line XZ. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ). So this is conflicting. What's going on here?

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The user provided several predicates, including Line(X,Z), Line(N,Z), and PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ) and PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ). So M and N are on line XZ. But then, if N is on line XZ and Z is on line XZ, then line NZ is part of line XZ. So triangle N-M-Z would have points N, M, Z all on line XZ, making it degenerate. Hence, the presence of Triangle(N,M,Z) as a valid triangle is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the line NZ is not the same as line XZ? No, because if N is on line XZ, then line NZ is the same as line XZ. So this seems unavoidable. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Or perhaps the right angle is not at M? Let me check the given predicates again. The RightAngle(Angle(X,M,Y)) and RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)). So the right angles are at M for both triangles. So the problem is inconsistent? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the triangles are not using the points as I thought. For example, Triangle(N,M,Z) could refer to a different configuration. Wait, the predicate IsSideOf(Line(N,M), Triangle(N,M,Z)), IsSideOf(Line(M,Z), Triangle(N,M,Z)), IsSideOf(Line(N,Z), Triangle(N,M,Z)). So the sides are NM, MZ, and NZ. Therefore, the triangle has vertices N, M, Z. So if N, M, Z are colinear, then the triangle is degenerate. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given predicates. But since this is a problem presented to solve, there must be a way around it. 

Perhaps the error is in assuming that points M and N are on the same line XZ. But the predicates say PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ) and PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ). So they are both on line XZ. Therefore, they are colinear with X and Z. So the problem is contradictory? Or perhaps the line XZ is not straight? No, Line(X,Z) is a straight line by definition. 

Wait, maybe the right angles are not at M? Let me check the Angle(X,M,Y) is right, and Angle(N,M,Z) is right. So the right angle in Triangle(X,M,Y) is at M, and in Triangle(N,M,Z) is at M. So both triangles share the vertex M, and have right angles at M. So for Triangle(X,M,Y), the legs are XM and YM, which are perpendicular. For Triangle(N,M,Z), the legs are NM and ZM, which are supposed to be perpendicular. But since N and Z are on the same line as M, then NM and ZM are along the same line, making the angle at M straight, not right. This contradiction suggests that there's a miscalculation in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the line XZ is not straight, but that's not possible. Or maybe the points are arranged differently. Let me consider that maybe M and N are not between X and Z, but in some other position. For instance, suppose that X---Z, and M is somewhere off the line XZ. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ), so M must be on XZ. Same for N. 

This is perplexing. Let me think differently. Suppose that even though N, M, Z are on line XZ, the segment NZ is not colinear with NM and MZ. Wait, but if they're all on the same line, then NZ is just NM plus MZ. So if NM is from N to M, and MZ is from M to Z, then NZ is NM + MZ. 

Wait, but if the right angle is at M in Triangle(N,M,Z), then vectors NM and ZM must be perpendicular. But since N, M, Z are colinear, vectors NM and ZM are in opposite directions, so their dot product is negative of the square of the length, hence not zero. Therefore, impossible. 

Unless... wait, maybe the triangle is not formed by the points N, M, Z, but by N, M, Z in a different way? Like, maybe the line NZ is not the same as the line XZ? But the predicate says Line(N,Z) exists, and Line(X,Z) exists, and both M and N are on Line(X,Z). So Line(N,Z) is the same as Line(X,Z). 

Hmm. There's a fundamental contradiction here, implying that the problem may have been misstated or there's a misinterpretation. However, since this is a problem to solve, I must proceed under the assumption that there's a correct configuration. Perhaps the error is in the assumption that both triangles have right angles at M, and that M is on XZ. Let me try to think outside the box.

Alternative approach: Maybe the line XZ is not straight? No, that's not possible. Or maybe the right angles are at different points? Wait, the predicates say RightAngle(Angle(X,M,Y)) and RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)). So the first right angle is at M (between X-M-Y), and the second is at M (between N-M-Z). So both right angles at M. 

Given that, and that M is on XZ, which contains N and Z, leading to the contradiction. Therefore, maybe the diagram is not planar? Or perhaps there's a 3D configuration? But the problem doesn't specify that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line XZ is not straight, but that's impossible. 

Wait, perhaps the length NZ is not along XZ? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ), so N is on XZ, so NZ is part of XZ. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on what needs to be found: XY. Given that, maybe I can ignore the contradictions and proceed with the coordinates, assuming that despite the degenerate triangle, there's a way to calculate XY. 

Earlier, I assigned coordinates with X at (0,0), M at (4,0), N at (6,0), Z at (15,0). Then, considering Triangle(X,M,Y) is right-angled at M. So, since M is at (4,0), and XM is from X(0,0) to M(4,0), which is along the x-axis. The right angle at M implies that MY is perpendicular to XM. Since XM is horizontal, MY must be vertical. So point Y would be somewhere along the vertical line passing through M(4,0). Let's say Y is at (4, b) for some b. 

Then, XY is the distance from X(0,0) to Y(4,b), which is sqrt((4-0)^2 + (b-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + b²). We need to find XY. But we don't know b yet. 

However, there's another condition involving Triangle(N,M,Z) being right-angled at M. In this coordinate system, N is at (6,0), M at (4,0), Z at (15,0). The triangle N-M-Z would have points N(6,0), M(4,0), Z(15,0), which are colinear, so it's degenerate. This suggests that there's no such triangle, which contradicts the given predicate. Hence, this approach is invalid. 

But maybe the triangle N-M-Z is not degenerate, so my assumption about the positions of N and Z is wrong. Let me reconsider. Maybe N is not between X and Z? Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(N, XZ), so N is on XZ. Let me assume that Z is between M and N? Or N is between M and Z? Let me try different configurations. 

Suppose that the order on line XZ is X, then Z, then M, then N? No, since XM=4, XN=6, so if X is at (0,0), then M would be at (4,0), N at (6,0), and Z would be beyond N. But then NZ=9 would put Z at (6+9=15,0). So same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe Z is between X and M? Let's say X is at (0,0), Z is at (something), M is at (4,0), N is at (6,0). But then XN=6 would mean N is at (6,0), and XZ would be shorter than XN. But NZ is 9, so Z would be at (6 - 9 = -3,0)? Then line XZ would go from X(0,0) through Z(-3,0) to M(4,0)? No, because M is at (4,0), which is to the right of X. So if Z is at (-3,0), then N at (6,0) would be on line XZ? Only if line XZ extends infinitely in both directions. So if Z is at (-3,0), then N at (6,0) is on line XZ (which goes through X(0,0) and Z(-3,0)), but N is at (6,0), which is not on the line extending from X to Z. Wait, line XZ is infinite, so if X is at (0,0) and Z is at (-3,0), then the line XZ passes through X(0,0), Z(-3,0), and extends infinitely. Point N at (6,0) is not on this line. So this contradicts the predicate that N lies on line XZ. 

Thus, regardless of the position of Z, if N is on line XZ, then XZ must extend past N. Hence, the previous scenario where X(0,0), M(4,0), N(6,0), Z(15,0) seems to be the only possibility. But then the triangle N-M-Z is degenerate. 

Maybe the problem assumes that despite the degeneracy, we proceed? Or perhaps there's an error in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not at M for Triangle(N,M,Z), but at another point? Let me check the predicates again. It says RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)), which means the right angle is at M, between N-M-Z. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should focus on finding XY without resolving the contradiction. Let's proceed with the coordinate system, ignoring the degenerate triangle, and see what happens. 

Assuming X(0,0), M(4,0), N(6,0), Z(15,0). For Triangle(X,M,Y) right-angled at M, Y is at (4, b). Then, XY is sqrt(4^2 + b^2). To find b, maybe we can use other information. Are there any other given lengths or relations?

Looking back, the predicates mention Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,N)), 6), which is satisfied as XN=6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(N,Z)), 9), which is NZ=9, also satisfied. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)), Add(LengthOf(Line(X,N)), LengthOf(Line(N,Z)))), which gives XZ=6+9=15, which matches our coordinates. 

Other predicates: Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,N)), Sub(LengthOf(Line(X,N)), LengthOf(Line(X,M)))) => MN = XN - XM = 6-4=2, which is true in our setup. 

Now, what about the other triangles? Triangle(X,Y,Z) is mentioned. So, we need to ensure that this triangle exists. With Y at (4,b), Z at (15,0), X at (0,0), and Y at (4,b), we can find XY and YZ and XZ. But how does this help us?

Wait, maybe there's more information. For example, the Triangle(X,Y,Z) is mentioned, and its sides are X,Y; Y,Z; X,Z. We need to find XY. 

But we need more constraints to find b. Are there any other given lengths or relationships?

Looking back, the predicates mention IsSideOf(Line(X,M), Triangle(X,M,Y)), which is already satisfied. Also, IsSideOf(Line(M,Y), Triangle(X,M,Y)), and IsSideOf(Line(X,Y), Triangle(X,M,Y)). 

For Triangle(N,M,Z), the sides are Line(N,M), Line(M,Z), Line(N,Z). But since N, M, Z are colinear, this triangle is degenerate. However, the problem states that it exists, so maybe there's a different configuration. 

Wait, maybe the line NZ is not the same as line XZ? If N is on line XZ, then line NZ is part of line XZ. But perhaps in the diagram, line NZ is not straight? No, lines are straight by definition. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in Triangle(N,M,Z) is not at M, but at N or Z? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)), which means the angle at M. 

At this point, I think the only way to resolve this is to accept that the triangle N-M-Z is degenerate and proceed with calculating XY, assuming that there's a typo or oversight in the problem. 

In the coordinate system, Y is at (4,b). Now, what other information do we have? The problem mentions Triangle(X,Y,Z). Let's assume that this triangle has certain properties. Are there any right angles or other conditions? The problem doesn't explicitly state anything about Triangle(X,Y,Z), except that it exists. 

But we need to find XY. If we can express other lengths in terms of b, maybe we can find b. 

For example, in Triangle(X,Y,Z), we can use the Pythagorean theorem if it's a right triangle, but there's no indication of that. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates to find relations. 

Wait, but without additional info, we can't determine b. So there must be another constraint I'm missing. 

Wait, the problem mentions Line(M,Y) and Line(M,Z). From the predicates, Line(M,Y) is present, and Line(M,Z) is present. In our coordinate system, Line(M,Y) connects M(4,0) to Y(4,b), which is vertical. Line(M,Z) connects M(4,0) to Z(15,0), which is horizontal. So, these two lines are perpendicular, as they are vertical and horizontal. But in the predicate, there's a RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)), which was causing issues. 

Wait, but in this setup, Line(M,Z) is horizontal, and Line(N,M) is from N(6,0) to M(4,0), which is horizontal. So Line(N,M) and Line(M,Z) are both horizontal, hence collinear, making the angle at M between N-M-Z 180 degrees, not right. Still a contradiction. 

But if we assume that Line(M,Z) is not horizontal, then perhaps there's a different configuration. Wait, but Line(M,Z) is determined by points M(4,0) and Z(15,0), which are on the x-axis, so it's horizontal. 

So, this suggests that the given predicates are inconsistent, making it impossible to determine XY. But since this is a problem to solve, there must be a resolution. 

Perhaps the error is in assuming that XZ is straight. Let me consider that XZ is not a straight line. But that contradicts the definition of Line(X,Z). 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in Triangle(N,M,Z) is not at M, but at Z? Let me check the predicate again. It says RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Z)), which is the angle at M. 

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to proceed with the coordinates and see if there's a way to find XY. 

In the coordinate system, Y is at (4,b). The length XY is sqrt(4² + b²). To find b, perhaps there's another relation. 

Wait, the Triangle(X,Y,Z) is mentioned. Let's calculate the lengths of its sides. XZ is 15 units. XY is sqrt(16 + b²). YZ is the distance between Y(4,b) and Z(15,0): sqrt((15-4)^2 + (0-b)^2) = sqrt(121 + b²). 

Now, is there any relationship between these lengths? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe there's a right angle in Triangle(X,Y,Z)? The problem doesn't state that, so I can't assume. 

Wait, but there's a right angle in Triangle(X,M,Y) at M. So, in Triangle(X,M,Y), which has sides XM=4, MY= sqrt(b²), and XY=sqrt(16 + b²). Since it's a right triangle at M, by Pythagoras: XM² + MY² = XY². Which is 4² + b² = (sqrt(16 + b²))² → 16 + b² = 16 + b², which holds true. So this doesn't give new information. 

Thus, we need another equation to solve for b. Where could this come from? 

Looking back at the predicates, there's no explicit mention of other lengths or angles. The only other given length is NZ=9, which we've used. 

Wait, perhaps the fact that Line(M,Y) and Line(N,Z) are related? Or maybe some other property. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar? For example, Triangle(X,M,Y) and Triangle(N,M,Z) having some similarity. 

In Triangle(X,M,Y), right-angled at M: legs XM=4 and MY=b, hypotenuse XY= sqrt(16 + b²).

In Triangle(N,M,Z), right-angled at M: legs NM=2 (since XN=6, XM=4, so NM=6-4=2) and MZ=11 (since NZ=9, and MZ is from M to Z: Z is at 15, M is at 4, so MZ=15-4=11). So, in this triangle, the legs are 2 and 11, so hypotenuse NZ= sqrt(2² + 11²) = sqrt(4 + 121) = sqrt(125). But NZ is given as 9, which contradicts this. Because according to the predicate, NZ=9, but according to this calculation, it should be sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, this shows that there's a conflict between the given length NZ=9 and the requirement for the right triangle N-M-Z. Hence, the problem is inconsistent. But since it's a problem to solve, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Maybe the length NZ is not the hypotenuse of the right triangle N-M-Z, but one of the legs? Let me rethink. 

If Triangle(N,M,Z) is right-angled at M, then the legs are NM and MZ, and the hypotenuse is NZ. So, according to Pythagoras: NM² + MZ² = NZ². 

From the given, NZ=9, NM=2 (since XN=6, XM=4, so NM=6-4=2). Let's plug in: 2² + MZ² = 9² → 4 + MZ² = 81 → MZ² = 77 → MZ = sqrt(77). But according to the earlier setup, MZ is the distance from M(4,0) to Z(15,0), which is 11. So this suggests that MZ=11, but according to the right triangle, it should be sqrt(77). This is a contradiction. 

Hence, there's a conflict between the given length NZ=9 and the right triangle condition in Triangle(N,M,Z). This indicates that the problem has inconsistent data. However, since this is a problem to solve, I must proceed under the assumption that there's a correct configuration, possibly requiring a different approach. 

Maybe the error is in assuming that MZ is along the line XZ. Let me consider that MZ is not along XZ. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(M, XZ), so M is on XZ. Line(M,Z) is defined, so Z is a point such that M and Z are connected by a line. If M is on XZ, then Z is on the same line as XZ. So MZ is part of XZ. 

This brings us back to the same contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps the length MZ is not 11, but something else? Let me re-express the given data. 

We have XN=6, XM=4, so NM=6-4=2. Given that Triangle(N,M,Z) is right-angled at M, so NM² + MZ² = NZ². Given NZ=9, so 2² + MZ² = 9² → MZ² = 81 - 4 = 77 → MZ = √77. 

But MZ is the distance from M to Z. Since M is on line XZ, and XN=6, XM=4, and NZ=9, then the position of Z depends on where it is relative to M. Let's denote the length XZ as follows: 

If M is between X and Z, then XZ = XM + MZ = 4 + MZ. But XN is 6, which is the distance from X to N. If N is between X and Z, then XN = 6, and since XM=4 < XN=6, N is between X and Z. So, from X to M to N to Z. Then, the distance from M to N is 6-4=2, and from N to Z is 9, so total XZ = XM + MN + NZ = 4 + 2 + 9 = 15. 

But then, MZ is the distance from M to Z, which is MN + NZ = 2 + 9 = 11. But according to the right triangle, MZ should be sqrt(77) ≈ 8.77. This is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, if Z is between X and M, then XZ = XM - MZ. But then XN=6 would imply that N is between X and Z, but since XM=4 < XN=6, this is impossible. 

Alternatively, if N is between M and Z, then XN = XM + MN, so 6 = 4 + MN → MN=2. Then, NZ = 9, so from N to Z is 9, so MZ = MN + NZ = 2 + 9 = 11, as before. Again, this leads to MZ=11, contradicting the right triangle requirement. 

Thus, the only way to satisfy the right triangle condition is if MZ = sqrt(77), which would require that XZ = XM + MZ = 4 + sqrt(77). But in this case, XN is the distance from X to N. If N is between X and Z, then XN = XM + MN, so MN = XN - XM = 6 - 4 = 2. Then, the position of N is 2 units from M towards Z. So, the total length XZ = XM + MN + NZ = 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, but this would make MZ = XZ - XM = 15 - 4 = 11, which conflicts with the right triangle condition. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent. However, since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I should proceed by using the right triangle condition to find MZ and then derive XY. 

Let me set up equations based on the right triangle. 

From Triangle(N,M,Z) right-angled at M: 
NM² + MZ² = NZ² → 2² + MZ² = 9² → MZ² = 81 - 4 = 77 → MZ = sqrt(77). 

Now, since M is on line XZ, and XN=6, XM=4, we need to find the position of Z such that MZ = sqrt(77). 

Let me assume that X, M, N, Z are colinear in some order. Let's consider the possible orders:

Case 1: X --- M ---- N ---- Z 

Then, XN = XM + MN = 4 + 2 = 6, which matches. Then, XZ = XM + MN + NZ = 4 + 2 + 9 = 15. But MZ = XZ - XM = 15 - 4 = 11, which contradicts MZ = sqrt(77). 

Case 2: X ---- N ---- M ---- Z 

Here, XN = 6, XM = 4. But if N is between X and M, then XM = XN + NM → 4 = 6 + NM → NM = -2, which is impossible. 

Case 3: X ---- M ---- Z ---- N 

Then, XN = XZ + ZN. But ZN is negative if N is after Z. Not possible. 

Case 4: X ---- Z ---- M ---- N 

Then, XZ is from X to Z, then M is after Z. XN = XZ + ZM + MN. But XN=6, XM=4, so ZM = XM - XZ. This seems complicated. 

Alternatively, let's use coordinates again, but this time allowing MZ to be sqrt(77). Let me place X at (0,0), M at (4,0). Let Z be at some point such that MZ = sqrt(77). Let me choose Z at (4 + sqrt(77), 0). Then, XZ = 4 + sqrt(77). 

Now, XN=6, so N is a point on line XZ at distance 6 from X. Since XZ is from (0,0) to (4 + sqrt(77), 0), the coordinates of N would be (6, 0) if the line XZ is extended. Wait, but this would mean that N is at (6,0), and since XZ is from X(0,0) to Z(4 + sqrt(77), 0), then N is between X and Z if 6 < 4 + sqrt(77). Since sqrt(77) ≈ 8.77, 4 + 8.77 ≈ 12.77, so 6 < 12.77, so N is between X and Z. 

Thus, the distance from N to Z is XZ - XN = (4 + sqrt(77)) - 6 = sqrt(77) - 2. But the given NZ=9, so:

sqrt(77) - 2 = 9 → sqrt(77) = 11 → 77 = 121, which is false. 

Thus, this approach also fails. 

This indicates that the given data is inconsistent. However, since the problem asks to find XY, perhaps we are meant to overlook the contradiction and proceed with the initial assumptions. 

Let me return to the initial coordinate setup where X(0,0), M(4,0), N(6,0), Z(15,0), and Y(4,b). Even though this creates a contradiction in the triangle N-M-Z, perhaps we are to ignore it and proceed. 

In this case, XY is sqrt(4² + b²). To find b, perhaps there's a relation from the other triangle. 

Wait, in Triangle(X,M,Y), which is right-angled at M, the length MY is b, and XY is sqrt(16 + b²). But there's no other given length related to Y. 

However, there's also Triangle(X,Y,Z). Let's calculate the distance YZ. Y is at (4,b), Z is at (15,0). So YZ = sqrt((15-4)^2 + (0-b)^2) = sqrt(121 + b²). 

If we assume that Triangle(X,Y,Z) is a right triangle, but there's no information about that. Without additional information, we cannot determine b. 

But the problem gives us no other lengths or angles, so it's impossible to determine b. This suggests that the problem is missing information or has a typo. 

But since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A.4, B.6, C.9, D.10, perhaps there's a way to infer XY from the given data. 

Wait, in the initial setup, if we ignore the contradiction and assume that the right triangle N-M-Z has legs NM=2 and MZ=11, then NZ should be sqrt(2² + 11²) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18, but the given NZ=9. This discrepancy suggests that the actual value of MZ is such that 2² + MZ² = 9² → MZ = sqrt(77). 

If we take this, then XZ = XM + MZ = 4 + sqrt(77). But XN is 6, which is the distance from X to N. If N is between X and Z, then XN = 6 = XM + MN → MN = 6 - 4 = 2. Thus, the distance from N to Z is XZ - XN = (4 + sqrt(77)) - 6 = sqrt(77) - 2. But this should equal NZ=9, giving sqrt(77) - 2 = 9 → sqrt(77) = 11 → 77 = 121, which is false. 

Alternatively, if N is not between X and Z, but on the other side of M, then XN would be XM + MN, but this would require MN to be negative. 

This is getting too tangled. Given that the problem is likely designed to have a solution, and the answer choices are simple numbers, perhaps there's a simpler approach. 

Let me consider that the triangles XMY and NZM are similar or something. 

From Triangle(X,M,Y) right-angled at M: XM=4, MY=?, XY=?

From Triangle(N,M,Z) right-angled at M: NM=2, MZ=?, NZ=9. 

If these triangles are similar, then the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Assuming similarity, we have:

XM / NM = MY / MZ = XY / NZ 

But we don't know if they are similar. However, if we assume that the triangles are similar, we can set up proportions. 

Let me assume that the triangles are similar. Then, XM/NM = MY/MZ = XY/NZ. 

Given XM=4, NM=2, NZ=9. 

So, 4/2 = MY/MZ → 2 = MY/MZ → MY = 2*MZ. 

Also, XY/NZ = 2 → XY = 2*9 = 18. But 18 is not among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if the triangles are not similar, but we use the Pythagorean theorem for both. 

For Triangle(X,M,Y): 4² + MY² = XY² → 16 + MY² = XY².

For Triangle(N,M,Z): 2² + MZ² = 9² → 4 + MZ² = 81 → MZ² = 77 → MZ = sqrt(77).

Now, if we can relate MY and MZ, perhaps through some other relationship. 

But without additional info, it's impossible. 

Wait, what if Line(M,Y) is parallel to Line(N,Z)? If that were the case, then the triangles might be similar. But there's no such information given. 

Alternatively, since both triangles are right-angled at M, and M is on XZ, perhaps there's a relation between MY and MZ. 

But without more info, this is speculative. 

Given that the answer choices are 4, 6, 9, 10, and the given lengths are 4, 6, 9, maybe XY is 10, which is 4 + 6. Or it could be derived from the Pythagorean theorem. 

If we assume that in Triangle(X,Y,Z), it is a right triangle, and XY is one leg, XZ is the hypotenuse, and YZ is the other leg. 

But XZ is 15 (from earlier assumption), and if XY is 10, then YZ would be sqrt(15² - 10²) = sqrt(225 - 100) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18. But this is just speculation. 

Alternatively, if Triangle(X,Y,Z) is a right triangle at Y, then XZ² = XY² + YZ². But without knowing which angle is right, this is guesswork. 

Given the lack of clear path, and the answer choices, I'll take a educated guess. Since the given lengths are 4, 6, 9, and the answer choices include 10, which is 4 + 6, or 6 + 4, or 9 + 1, but 10 is plausible. 

Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem with 6 and 8, but 6 is given as XN, and 8 is not mentioned. 

Wait, in the initial setup where XZ=15, and if we assume that Y is such that XY is part of a right triangle with other sides, but without knowing, it's hard. 

Another angle: Since XM=4, XN=6, and NZ=9, and MZ is sqrt(77), then perhaps XY is computed using some relation. 

But I'm running out of ideas. Given the answer choices, and the fact that in the initial setup where XZ=15, and if we assume that Y is such that XY is part of a right triangle with other sides, perhaps the answer is 10.
