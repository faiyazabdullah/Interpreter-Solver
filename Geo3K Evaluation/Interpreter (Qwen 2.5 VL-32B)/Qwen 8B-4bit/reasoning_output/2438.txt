MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of WR, which I think refers to the length of segment WR. The answer choices are A. 6, B. 8, C. 10, D. 12. Let me start by going through the given predicates and see what information I can extract.

First, the points mentioned are W, R, T, V, S. Then there are several lines connecting them: Line(W,R), Line(R,T), Line(W,T), Line(V,T), Line(S,W), Line(S,R). Also, there are triangles: Triangle(W,R,S), Triangle(R,T,V), Triangle(W,R,T). Plus some right angles at Angles(W,R,S), Angle(R,T,V), Angle(W,R,T), and Angle(V,T,R). There are also some length equalities involving variables x and constants. And Collinear(W, R, T) is given.

So, first thing, since Collinear(W, R, T) is stated, that means points W, R, T lie on a straight line. Therefore, the segment WT is a straight line passing through R. That might be important because it could relate to the right angles and triangles mentioned.

Looking at the triangles: Triangle(W,R,S), so points W, R, S form a triangle. Since S is connected to W and R via Line(S,W) and Line(S,R), that makes sense. Also, RightAngle(Angle(W,R,S)) indicates that angle at R in triangle WRS is a right angle. Wait, because Angle(W,R,S) would be the angle at point R between segments RW and RS. So triangle WRS is a right-angled triangle at R. Similarly, Triangle(R,T,V) with RightAngle(Angle(R,T,V)), meaning angle at T in triangle RTV is a right angle. Also, Triangle(W,R,T) has a right angle at R (since Angle(W,R,T) is right), so that triangle is right-angled at R. Additionally, Angle(V,T,R) is right, so triangle VTR is right-angled at T.

Now, looking at the lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,S)), 8). So WS = 8. Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,R)), x + 6). So WR = x + 6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,T)), 2x + 6). So RT = 2x + 6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(V,T)), 10). So VT = 10. 

Since W, R, T are collinear, the entire segment WT is made up of WR and RT. Because they're collinear in that order? Wait, the order isn't specified, but since W-R-T are collinear, depending on how the points are arranged. But typically, if points are listed as W, R, T, then the order is W---R---T. So that would make WR + RT = WT. However, since there's a right angle at R in triangle WRT (from Angle(W,R,T) being right), that suggests that triangle WRT is right-angled at R, making WR and RT perpendicular. Wait, but if they are collinear, then they can't be perpendicular unless one of them is zero length, which doesn't make sense. Wait, hold on—there's a contradiction here. How can W, R, T be collinear and have a right angle at R?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The right angles are in different triangles. For example, Angle(W,R,T) is a right angle. So that angle is at point R, between segments RW and RT. But if W, R, T are collinear, then angle at R between RW and RT would be 180 degrees, not 90. So that seems contradictory. Unless... wait, perhaps the collinearity is not in the order W-R-T. Maybe the points are arranged differently. Wait, the collinearity is given as Collinear(W, R, T), which usually implies the order W-R-T, but maybe it's another arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is part of another triangle, not directly involving the collinearity.

Wait, let's re-examine the triangles. Triangle(W,R,T) has a right angle at R. So according to the predicate RightAngle(Angle(W,R,T)), which is the angle at R between segments RW and RT. But if W, R, T are collinear, then that angle can't be a right angle. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Wait, maybe my understanding of the collinearity is incorrect. Or perhaps the right angle isn't part of the same triangle as the collinearity? Let me check again.

The collinearity is given as Collinear(W, R, T), which usually implies that all three points lie on a single straight line. However, if there's a right angle at R in triangle WRT, that would require that RW and RT are perpendicular. But if they are collinear, they can't be perpendicular. This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the collinearity is not implying the order W-R-T? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the points are connected.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle WRT is not a degenerate triangle. Wait, but if W, R, T are collinear, then triangle WRT would be degenerate (a straight line), which can't have a right angle. Hence, there must be an error in my interpretation. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the given predicates include Collinear(W, R, T), and also RightAngle(Angle(W,R,T)). That seems conflicting. So either the problem has inconsistent data, or I'm misinterpreting the collinearity. Wait, perhaps the collinearity is not about the points being in a straight line, but rather that they are aligned in some other way? No, Collinear(W, R, T) should mean that all three are on a straight line.

But then, how can there be a right angle at R in triangle WRT? It's impossible. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the right angle is not in triangle WRT but in another triangle?

Wait, let me check the list of right angles again. The right angles are:

- Angle(W,R,S): right angle at R in triangle WRS.

- Angle(R,T,V): right angle at T in triangle RTV.

- Angle(W,R,T): right angle at R in triangle WRT.

- Angle(V,T,R): right angle at T in triangle VTR.

So, the third right angle is in triangle WRT, which is supposed to have a right angle at R. But if W, R, T are collinear, that's impossible. Therefore, there must be an error here. Wait, maybe the collinearity applies to different points? Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem says:

Given the predicates:

Collinear(W, R, T)

So yes, that's explicitly stated. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Unless the right angle isn't in triangle WRT, but in another triangle. Wait, but the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(W,R,T)), which is the angle at R between W and T. So that's in triangle WRT. Hmm.

This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo? Or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not in the triangle WRT, but the angle is formed differently. Wait, maybe the angle is not part of triangle WRT. Wait, the triangle is defined as Triangle(W,R,T), so that triangle includes points W, R, T. Therefore, the angle at R is between sides RW and RT, which are collinear, hence forming a straight line, not a right angle. So this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick, or maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not in the triangle WRT, but in another triangle? Wait, the other right angles are in triangles WRS, RTV, and VTR. Let me look again:

RightAngle(Angle(W,R,S)): triangle WRS is right-angled at R.

RightAngle(Angle(R,T,V)): triangle RTV is right-angled at T.

RightAngle(Angle(W,R,T)): triangle WRT is right-angled at R.

RightAngle(Angle(V,T,R)): triangle VTR is right-angled at T.

So, the third right angle is in triangle WRT. But since W, R, T are collinear, that triangle is degenerate. So this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I've misunderstood the structure.

Wait, perhaps the collinearity is not of W, R, T in that order. Suppose that R is between W and T, but then the angle at R would still be straight. Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that R is not between W and T. For example, suppose W and T are on opposite sides of R. Wait, but even then, if W, R, T are collinear, then the angle at R between W and T would still be 180 degrees. So regardless of the order, the angle would be straight. Therefore, there's a contradiction here.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem is intended to have that despite the collinearity, there's a right angle. Which would imply that the triangle WRT is actually not a triangle, but that's conflicting with the given Triangle(W,R,T). Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem. However, assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the right angle is not in the triangle WRT, but in another configuration? For instance, perhaps the right angle is formed by different segments. Wait, the angle in question is Angle(W,R,T), which is the angle at R between W and T. If those points are collinear, then that angle is 180 degrees, not 90. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Hence, perhaps the problem contains an error. But since the user provided this problem, I have to work with it. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not part of triangle WRT but in another triangle. Let me check again. The right angles are in four different places:

1. Angle(W,R,S): right angle at R in triangle WRS.

2. Angle(R,T,V): right angle at T in triangle RTV.

3. Angle(W,R,T): right angle at R in triangle WRT.

4. Angle(V,T,R): right angle at T in triangle VTR.

Therefore, the third right angle is indeed in triangle WRT. So, unless there's a misinterpretation of the angle. Maybe the angle is not between WR and RT, but between different segments? For example, maybe the angle is between RW and RT, but since they are collinear, that's 180 degrees. Alternatively, maybe the angle is between WR and some other segment? Wait, the angle is written as Angle(W,R,T), which standardly denotes the angle at point R between points W and T. So that's the angle between RW and RT, which are collinear, leading to a straight angle. So this is impossible. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. 

However, since the problem is given, I have to proceed. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but I need to find a way to resolve it. Let me consider that maybe the collinearity is not of W, R, T, but of other points. Wait, no, the predicate says Collinear(W, R, T). 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not in the triangle WRT, but in another triangle where the angle is formed by different segments. Wait, but the Angle(W,R,T) is explicitly mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle WRT is not a right triangle, but the angle is considered in a different way. For example, if the right angle is formed outside the triangle. Wait, no—the right angle is part of the triangle. 

This is confusing. Given that, perhaps the problem assumes that despite the collinearity, the right angle exists. Therefore, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a miscalculation here and that the right angle somehow exists. Maybe the points are arranged such that WR and RT are perpendicular, but W, R, T are not collinear? But the collinearity is given. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not in the triangle WRT but in another triangle. Let me check the other triangles. For example, Triangle(W,R,S) is right-angled at R, which makes sense because S is connected to W and R, and the right angle is at R. So triangle WRS is right-angled at R. Similarly, Triangle(R,T,V) is right-angled at T, so that makes sense. Triangle(V,T,R) is right-angled at T, same as before. 

But back to Triangle(W,R,T). Assuming that despite the collinearity, we can have a right angle. Maybe the right angle is not between WR and RT, but between other segments. Wait, but the angle is specified as Angle(W,R,T), which is the angle at R between W and T. So that must be between segments RW and RT. 

Perhaps the problem meant that the right angle is at W or T instead of R? Let me check the original problem again. The right angles are:

- RightAngle(Angle(W,R,S)) → angle at R.

- RightAngle(Angle(R,T,V)) → angle at T.

- RightAngle(Angle(W,R,T)) → angle at R.

- RightAngle(Angle(V,T,R)) → angle at T.

So two right angles at R and two at T. 

Assuming that there's an inconsistency here, but proceeding with the given information. Maybe the key lies elsewhere. Let's focus on the lengths and equations. 

We have:

WS = 8.

WR = x + 6.

RT = 2x + 6.

VT = 10.

Also, Collinear(W, R, T).

If we assume that W, R, T are collinear, then the total length WT = WR + RT. So WT = (x+6) + (2x+6) = 3x + 12.

But also, considering triangle WRS is right-angled at R. So in triangle WRS, with right angle at R, we can use Pythagoras. The sides are WR, RS, and WS. Since it's a right triangle at R, WR² + RS² = WS². We know WS = 8, so:

(x + 6)^2 + RS^2 = 8^2 → (x+6)^2 + RS^2 = 64.

But we don't know RS yet. However, there's another triangle involving S: Line(S,W) and Line(S,R), so S is connected to W and R, forming triangle WRS. Also, there's Line(S,R), which connects S to R. Is there any more info about S? Not directly, except that it's part of the triangles.

Additionally, there's Triangle(R,T,V) with a right angle at T. So triangle RTV is right-angled at T. So RT and TV are the legs, and RV is the hypotenuse. We know RT = 2x + 6 and VT = 10. So applying Pythagoras:

RT² + VT² = RV² → (2x + 6)^2 + 10^2 = RV^2.

But without knowing RV, this might not help immediately. However, maybe there's another relationship. 

Also, there's Triangle(V,T,R) with right angle at T. Which is the same as triangle RTV, right? So that's consistent. 

But how do these connect to find x?

Let me think. We need to find WR, which is x + 6. So if we can find x, we can compute WR.

To find x, we might need to use other relations. Let's consider triangle WRT. Even though there's a conflict with the collinearity, maybe we can proceed formally. If we assume that triangle WRT is right-angled at R, then WR and RT are the legs, and WT is the hypotenuse. So:

WR² + RT² = WT².

But if W, R, T are collinear, then WT = WR + RT, so substituting:

WR² + RT² = (WR + RT)^2.

Expanding the RHS: WR² + 2*WR*RT + RT².

Subtracting WR² + RT² from both sides gives 0 = 2*WR*RT, which implies WR=0 or RT=0, which is impossible. Thus, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong. 

But the problem states that Triangle(W,R,T) exists and has a right angle at R. So this suggests that the triangle is not degenerate, meaning that W, R, T are not collinear. But the collinearity is given! This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting something. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not in the triangle WRT but in another part. Let me recheck the given right angles. The fourth right angle is Angle(V,T,R), which is at T in triangle VTR, same as Angle(R,T,V). 

Wait, but the third right angle is Angle(W,R,T), which is at R in triangle WRT. If the triangle WRT is not degenerate, then W, R, T cannot be collinear. But the problem says they are collinear. So this is a paradox. 

Unless the problem has a typo, and the collinearity is not of W, R, T but of other points. For example, maybe it's Collinear(W, R, S)? Or another combination. But the given predicate is Collinear(W, R, T). 

Given that, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the contradiction and proceed with the equations? Let me try that. 

Assume that despite the collinearity, the right angle exists. So in triangle WRT, right-angled at R, then WR and RT are legs, and WT is the hypotenuse. So:

WR² + RT² = WT².

But since W, R, T are collinear, WT = WR + RT. So substituting:

WR² + RT² = (WR + RT)^2.

Which simplifies to 0 = 2*WR*RT, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach fails. 

But maybe there's another way. Perhaps the right angle is not between WR and RT, but between other segments. For example, if the right angle is between RW and some other segment? Wait, the angle is Angle(W,R,T), which is the angle at R between W and T. So that must be between RW and RT. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not in triangle WRT, but in another triangle. Wait, the right angles are in four different triangles. So perhaps there's a different relation. 

Let me look at triangle WRS, which is right-angled at R. So WR is one leg, RS is another leg, and WS is hypotenuse. We know WS = 8. Also, WR = x + 6. Let's denote WR = a = x + 6, RS = b, then a² + b² = 8² = 64.

Similarly, in triangle RTV, right-angled at T. RT = 2x + 6, VT = 10, so RT² + VT² = RV². So (2x+6)^2 + 10^2 = RV^2.

Is there any connection between these triangles? Perhaps through point S or V?

Also, there's Line(V,T), which connects V to T. Since triangle RTV is right-angled at T, then V is positioned such that TV is perpendicular to RT. So TV ⊥ RT. 

Additionally, there's Line(S,W) and Line(S,R), which forms triangle WRS. 

Maybe we can find RS in terms of x, then relate it to other parts. But without more information, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to the points to model the situation. 

Let me place point R at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since triangle WRS is right-angled at R, we can set W along the x-axis and S along the y-axis. Let me define:

- Point R: (0, 0)

- Point W: (a, 0), where a = WR = x + 6

- Point S: (0, b), where b = RS

Then, the length WS would be sqrt(a² + b²) = 8, so a² + b² = 64.

Now, since W, R, T are collinear. Since W is at (a, 0) and R is at (0,0), the line WT passes through R and extends to T. Let me parametrize this line. The line from W to R is horizontal (since W is at (a, 0) and R is at (0,0)), so the line is the x-axis. Therefore, point T lies somewhere on the x-axis. Since R is between W and T, or T is on the extension beyond R. 

Assuming that T is on the x-axis. Let me say T has coordinates (c, 0). Since RT = 2x + 6, and R is at (0,0), then the distance from R to T is |c - 0| = |c|. So RT = |c| = 2x + 6. Assuming T is to the right of R, c > 0, so c = 2x + 6. Therefore, T is at (2x + 6, 0). 

Thus, the coordinates:

W: (a, 0) = (x+6, 0)

R: (0, 0)

T: (2x + 6, 0)

Now, since triangle WRT is supposed to have a right angle at R. But in this coordinate system, points W, R, T are colinear on the x-axis, so angle at R is 180 degrees. This contradicts the right angle. Hence, this suggests that the problem is inconsistent. However, since the problem is given, perhaps I need to find another way.

Wait, but maybe the right angle is not in triangle WRT, but in another triangle. Let me check again. The right angles are in:

- Triangle WRS at R.

- Triangle RTV at T.

- Triangle WRT at R.

- Triangle VTR at T.

But according to the coordinates above, triangle WRT is degenerate. So the third right angle (at R) cannot exist. Therefore, this suggests that the problem may have an error. But assuming that the problem is correct, maybe the right angle at R in triangle WRT is not referring to the angle between WR and RT, but another angle? For example, maybe it's the angle between WR and another segment?

Wait, the Angle(W,R,T) is the angle at R between W and T, which is the same as the angle between RW and RT. So in the coordinate system, that angle is 180 degrees. Hence, the problem is flawed. 

But perhaps the problem assumes that the right angle is not in the triangle WRT, but in another configuration. Let me think differently. Perhaps the right angle at R in triangle WRT is actually referring to a different triangle. For example, maybe it's part of another triangle involving point S? But no, the right angles are specifically given. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle at R in triangle WRT is due to some other construction. For example, if there's a square or rectangle involved. But without more information, it's hard to tell. 

At this point, perhaps I should proceed by ignoring the contradiction and focusing on the equations that can be solved. Let's look at the other parts. 

From triangle WRS, we have a² + b² = 64, where a = WR = x+6, and b = RS. 

From triangle RTV, we have RT² + VT² = RV². RT = 2x+6, VT = 10. So (2x+6)^2 + 10^2 = RV². 

But without knowing RV, this might not help. However, maybe there's a connection between RS and RV? 

Alternatively, consider point V. Since Line(V,T) is given, and triangle RTV is right-angled at T, then V is located such that TV is perpendicular to RT. In our coordinate system, RT is along the x-axis from R(0,0) to T(2x+6, 0). Therefore, TV is vertical (perpendicular to x-axis). So point V has coordinates (2x+6, d), where d is some value. Since VT = 10, the distance from T to V is 10, so |d| = 10. Assuming upwards direction, V is at (2x+6, 10). 

Now, there's also Line(V,T), which we've used. Now, what about other connections? Are there any other lines or triangles involving V? 

There's Triangle(V,T,R), which is right-angled at T. So that's the same as triangle RTV. 

Now, is there any relation between V and other points? Like point S? Not directly given. 

But we might need to find more relations. Let's think about point S. In triangle WRS, we have S at (0, b). What else is known about S? Line(S,W) and Line(S,R), which are already accounted for. 

Is there any other information about S? Maybe through other triangles or lines? 

No, the only other mention is Triangle(W,R,S), which is already covered. 

So, with that, we have:

From triangle WRS: (x+6)^2 + b^2 = 64 → b^2 = 64 - (x+6)^2.

But we don't know b. 

Now, is there any other equation involving x? Let's think. 

We have the length of VT = 10, which we used. 

What about the other triangles? 

Triangle(W,R,T) is problematic, but perhaps there's another relation. 

Wait, what about the position of point S? Could there be a relation between S and V? Or is there any other line connecting S to V? The given lines are Line(W,R), Line(R,T), Line(W,T), Line(V,T), Line(S,W), Line(S,R). No direct connection between S and V. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation through the right angle at R in triangle WRS. But I don't see it. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express RV in terms of other quantities? For example, RV is the hypotenuse of triangle RTV, which is sqrt[(2x+6)^2 + 10^2]. But without more info, this doesn't help. 

Wait, but maybe there's a connection between RS and RV? For example, if points S and V are related? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that S is connected to W and R, and V is connected to T. But no direct link. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me revisit the problem and see if I missed anything. 

The question asks to find WR, which is x + 6. To find x, I need another equation. 

Let me think again: the only other given is the length of Line(V,T) = 10, which we've used. Are there any other lengths? 

No, the only other lengths are WS = 8, WR = x+6, RT = 2x+6, VT = 10. 

So, perhaps there's a way to relate these using the right angles. For example, in triangle WRS, we have WR = x+6, WS = 8, RS = sqrt(64 - (x+6)^2). 

In triangle RTV, we have RT = 2x+6, VT = 10, and RV = sqrt[(2x+6)^2 + 10^2]. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, maybe there's a relation between RS and RV? If there's a line connecting S to V? But there's no information about that. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that RS = VT? But that's not given. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar? For example, if triangle WRS is similar to triangle RTV? Let's check. 

For similarity, corresponding angles must be equal. But without knowing angles, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the coordinates. Let me try that. 

Earlier, I placed R at (0,0), W at (x+6, 0), T at (2x+6, 0), and S at (0, b). Now, point V is at (2x+6, 10). 

Are there any other points or lines? For example, is there a line connecting S and V? Not explicitly given. 

But perhaps there's a right angle at V? No, the only right angles are at R and T. 

Wait, the problem mentions Line(V,T), and Triangle(R,T,V) is right-angled at T. So that's covered. 

Is there any other information? Let me check the given predicates again. 

Yes, there's also Triangle(W,R,T), which is right-angled at R. But in our coordinate system, that triangle is degenerate. So this is a contradiction. 

But perhaps the problem assumes that despite this, we can proceed. Let me try to force it. 

Suppose that in triangle WRT, even though it's degenerate, we treat it as having a right angle. So, WR and RT are perpendicular. But in reality, they are collinear, so this is impossible. However, if we proceed formally, we can write WR² + RT² = WT². 

But WT is WR + RT = (x+6) + (2x+6) = 3x + 12. 

So:

(x+6)^2 + (2x+6)^2 = (3x + 12)^2

Expand left side: (x² + 12x + 36) + (4x² + 24x + 36) = 5x² + 36x + 72

Right side: 9x² + 72x + 144

Setting equal:

5x² + 36x + 72 = 9x² + 72x + 144

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 4x² + 36x + 72

Divide by 4:

0 = x² + 9x + 18

Factor:

x² + 9x + 18 = (x + 3)(x + 6) = 0 → x = -3 or x = -6

But x represents a length, so it must be positive. Both solutions are negative, which is invalid. Hence, no solution. This confirms the contradiction. 

This suggests that the problem as stated is inconsistent. However, since the problem is presented, perhaps there's an error in the given predicates, or I missed something. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is not in triangle WRT, but in another triangle. Let me check again. 

The right angles are:

- Angle(W,R,S): right angle at R in triangle WRS.

- Angle(R,T,V): right angle at T in triangle RTV.

- Angle(W,R,T): right angle at R in triangle WRT.

- Angle(V,T,R): right angle at T in triangle VTR.

So, the third right angle is in triangle WRT. But as shown, this leads to a contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at W in triangle WRT? If so, then the angle at W would be right. Let me check. If the angle at W is right, then in triangle WRT, the right angle is at W. Then, WR and WT would be perpendicular. But since W, R, T are collinear, WT is a straight line, so this is impossible. 

Same issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at T in triangle WRT? Then, angle at T is right. So, in triangle WRT, right-angled at T. Then, RT and WT are perpendicular. But since W, R, T are collinear, WT is a straight line, so this is impossible. 

Hence, no matter where the right angle is in triangle WRT, it's impossible if W, R, T are collinear. 

This suggests that the problem is incorrectly formulated. However, assuming that the problem is correct, and there's a way to resolve it, perhaps the collinearity is not of W, R, T, but of other points? Let me check again. 

The given predicate is Collinear(W, R, T). So it must be. 

At this point, perhaps the intended solution ignores the collinearity and proceeds with the right angle in triangle WRT. Even though it's mathematically impossible, let's proceed. 

From earlier, we had the equation x² + 9x + 18 = 0, giving x = -3 or -6. Since x must be positive, this is invalid. Hence, no solution. 

But since the answer choices are positive numbers, perhaps there's an alternative approach. Let me try to look for another way. 

Wait, what if the right angle is not in triangle WRT, but in another triangle? Let me check the given right angles again. 

The fourth right angle is Angle(V,T,R), which is at T, in triangle VTR. So that's the same as triangle RTV. 

Maybe there's a way to relate RS and VT? For example, if RS = VT? 

If RS = VT = 10, then from triangle WRS, we have:

(x+6)^2 + 10^2 = 8^2 → (x+6)^2 = 64 - 100 = -36, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe RS is related to RT? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle WRS, RS is a leg, and in triangle RTV, VT is a leg. But without more info, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves similar triangles. Let me think. 

If triangle WRS is right-angled at R, and triangle RTV is right-angled at T, perhaps there's a proportionality. 

But without knowing angles or other sides, it's hard to establish. 

Wait, let's go back to the original equations. We have:

From triangle WRS: (x+6)^2 + RS^2 = 64.

From triangle RTV: (2x+6)^2 + 10^2 = RV^2.

But if there's a relation between RS and RV? For example, if RS = RV? Or some other relation? 

Without additional information, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use the coordinates of point V and S. 

In the coordinate system, S is at (0, b), and V is at (2x+6, 10). Is there a line connecting S and V? Not given, but maybe there's a right angle at S or V? 

No, the given right angles are only at R and T. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the intended solution is to ignore the contradiction and proceed with the equation from the right angle in triangle WRT, even though it leads to no solution, but perhaps there's a typo in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at T in triangle WRT? Let's try that. 

If triangle WRT is right-angled at T, then RT and WT are perpendicular. But since W, R, T are collinear, this is impossible. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at W in triangle WRT, then WR and WT are perpendicular. Again, impossible. 

Thus, this suggests that the problem has a fundamental flaw. 

But since the answer choices are given, and the options are A. 6, B. 8, C. 10, D. 12, perhaps the intended solution is to solve for x using the equation from triangle WRT, even though it's contradictory, and choose the closest possible value. 

Previously, we had x² + 9x + 18 = 0, which gives x = -3 or -6. These are negative, but if we take absolute value, x = 3 or 6. Let's try x = 6. Then WR = x + 6 = 12, which is option D. Alternatively, x = 3, WR = 9, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the equation was supposed to be WR² + RT² = WT², but with WT = |WR - RT|, assuming T is on the other side of R from W. Let's try that. 

Assume that T is on the opposite side of R from W. So, if W is at (a, 0), R at (0,0), then T is at (-c, 0), where c = RT = 2x+6. Then WT = WR + RT = a + c = (x+6) + (2x+6) = 3x + 12. Wait, no. If T is on the opposite side, then WT = WR + RT? No, if W is at (a, 0), R at (0,0), T at (-c, 0), then WT = distance from W to T is a + c. But RT = distance from R to T is c. 

So, in this case, if triangle WRT is right-angled at R, then WR and RT are perpendicular. But since they are collinear, this is still impossible. 

But if we force the equation WR² + RT² = WT², then:

(x+6)^2 + (2x+6)^2 = (3x + 12)^2, which leads to the same equation as before, giving x = -3 or -6. 

But if we disregard the sign and take x = 3, then WR = x + 6 = 9, which isn't an option. If x = 6, WR = 12, which is option D. 

Since 12 is one of the choices, and perhaps the problem intended this, even though it's mathematically inconsistent, maybe the answer is D. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try to ignore the right angle in triangle WRT and focus on the other right angles. 

From triangle WRS: (x+6)^2 + RS^2 = 64.

From triangle RTV: (2x+6)^2 + 10^2 = RV^2.

But without more info, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, what if we assume that RS = VT = 10? Then, from triangle WRS:

(x+6)^2 + 10^2 = 64 → (x+6)^2 = -36, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if RS = RT? Let's say RS = 2x+6. Then:

(x+6)^2 + (2x+6)^2 = 64 → expand:

x² + 12x + 36 + 4x² + 24x + 36 = 5x² + 36x + 72 = 64 → 5x² + 36x + 72 = 64 → 5x² + 36x + 8 = 0. Solving:

Discriminant = 36^2 - 4*5*8 = 1296 - 160 = 1136. Square root of 1136 is approximately 33.7. x = [-36 ± 33.7]/10. Positive solution would be ( -36 + 33.7 ) / 10 ≈ -0.23, which is negative. No good. 

Alternatively, maybe RS = 8? Then:

(x+6)^2 + 8^2 = 64 → (x+6)^2 = 0 → x = -6, which is invalid. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the right angle is at S in triangle WRS? No, the predicate says Angle(W,R,S) is right, so at R. 

At this point, given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll hypothesize that the intended solution is to use the equation from the right angle in triangle WRT, even though it leads to a contradiction, and take x = 6, giving WR = 12, which is option D. 

Thus, Final Answer: D.
