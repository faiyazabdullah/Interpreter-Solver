MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the value of x given two angle measures expressed in terms of x. The angles are ∠4 and ∠5, with their measures given by 2x + 23 and 7x - 5 respectively. Also, it's mentioned that the sum of these two angles is 180 degrees. 

First, I need to recall that if two angles add up to 180 degrees, they are supplementary. That usually happens when they form a linear pair or are consecutive interior angles on a transversal cutting two parallel lines. But since the problem doesn't mention any specific geometric figure, maybe I should just focus on the algebra here.

So, according to the given, SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(5))) equals 180. Translating that into an equation, it would be (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180. Let me write that down properly:

2x + 23 + 7x - 5 = 180

Combining like terms, the x terms are 2x and 7x, so that's 9x. Then the constants are 23 - 5, which is 18. So the equation simplifies to 9x + 18 = 180.

Now, solving for x. Subtract 18 from both sides: 9x = 180 - 18, which is 162. Then divide both sides by 9: x = 162 / 9. Calculating that, 162 divided by 9 is 18. Wait, but let me check that again. 9 times 18 is 162? Yes, because 9*10=90, 9*8=72, so 90+72=162. So x equals 18. 

Looking at the answer choices, B is 18. But wait, let me make sure there isn't a mistake here. Let me verify by plugging x=18 back into the original expressions for the angles. 

For Angle 4: 2*(18) +23 = 36 +23 = 59 degrees. For Angle 5: 7*(18)-5 = 126 -5 = 121 degrees. Adding them together: 59 + 121 = 180. Yep, that checks out. So x=18 is correct. 

But wait, looking at the answer options, B is 18. So the correct answer should be B. However, sometimes problems might have tricks, like maybe the angles aren't supplementary? But the problem states that their sum is 180, so that's given. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. 

I don't see any other factors here. The problem didn't mention any diagrams or other conditions, so the straightforward algebra applies. Hence, x=18 is the right answer, which corresponds to choice B.
