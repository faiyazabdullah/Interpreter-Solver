Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the relationships between the points and lines. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, and BF. Angles mentioned are at points B, involving A, C, F. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(A,F,B) and another at Angle(E,F,D). Plus, AC is parallel to ED. Some lengths are given: BA=6, BC=7.5, AC=9, DE=9. There's also a similarity between triangles ABC and EBD.

Wait, the question asks for BD. So we need to find the length of segment BD. Let me try to visualize or sketch the figure based on the given lines and points.

First, since there are lines forming a hexagon? Because the lines are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, and BF. Wait, but BF is an extra line. Maybe it's a combination of polygons. But maybe focusing on triangles and the given similarities would help.

Given that AC is parallel to ED. Also, there's a similarity between triangle ABC and triangle EBD. Let me note that. Similarity implies corresponding angles are equal and sides are proportional.

Also, BF bisects angle ABC. Since BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, and we know BA=6, BC=7.5. So perhaps using the angle bisector theorem here?

Let me recall the angle bisector theorem: In a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So if BF bisects angle ABC, then AF / FC = AB / BC. Wait, but wait—no, the angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the two segments created on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides. Wait, but in this case, the angle bisector is BF, so does it intersect AC? Or is there a point where BF meets AC?

Wait, the problem mentions that BF is part of the lines. Looking back, the lines are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, and BF. So point F connects to B and E. Wait, the line BF exists. So BF starts at B and goes to F. So in triangle ABC, BF is the angle bisector of angle B. Therefore, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of AF to FC should be equal to AB over BC. Wait, but AF isn't necessarily on AC. Wait, unless F is on AC? Wait, but the lines given include FA and BF. So F is connected to A and B. Therefore, in triangle ABC, BF is the angle bisector, and F is a point such that FA and FB are connected. Hmm, but how does F relate to AC?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC has BF as its angle bisector, but F is not on AC. Wait, but if BF is the angle bisector, then it should meet AC at some point. However, in our case, F is connected to A and B. So maybe F is a different point? Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me think again.

Wait, the lines given include FA, so F is connected to A. And BF is a line from B to F. So F is a point connected to both B and A. So in triangle ABC, if BF is the angle bisector of angle B, then F must lie somewhere such that BF splits angle B into two equal parts. But since F is connected to A, that suggests that F lies on the extension of AC? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe F is a separate point not on AC. This seems confusing. Maybe I need to consider other given information.

Another piece of info: AC is parallel to ED. Given that AC = 9 and DE = 9. So AC || ED and they are equal in length. That suggests that maybe quadrilateral ACDE is a parallelogram? Wait, but if AC is parallel to ED and they are equal, then yes, if AD and CE are also parallel and equal, but I don't know about those yet. Alternatively, since AC || ED, maybe triangle ABC is similar to triangle EBD because of the given similarity statement.

Wait, the problem says "Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D))". So triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD. So their corresponding angles are equal, and sides are in proportion. Let's write down the similarity ratios.

So if triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then the order of the letters matters. So angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle B, angle C corresponds to angle D? Wait, but triangle ABC has vertices A, B, C; triangle EBD has E, B, D. So the correspondence would be A → E, B → B, C → D. Therefore, angle at B is common? Wait, but angle at B in triangle ABC is angle ABC, and in triangle EBD, angle at B is angle EBD. So if they are similar, then angle ABC equals angle EBD. But since BF bisects angle ABC, which is angle at B in triangle ABC. So angle EBD would be half of angle ABC? Wait, maybe not directly. Let me think.

But first, the similarity ratio. Since triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then AB / EB = BC / BD = AC / ED. We know AC = 9, ED = 9. So AC / ED = 9 / 9 = 1. Therefore, AB / EB = BC / BD = 1. Which means AB = EB and BC = BD. Wait, but AB is given as 6. So EB would be 6? Then BC is 7.5, so BD would be 7.5? But that contradicts the answer options given. Wait, the answer options are A.12, B.13.5, C.15, D.18. So 7.5 isn't among them. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. Maybe the correspondence is different?

Wait, maybe the similarity is not A→E, B→B, C→D. Perhaps the correspondence is different. For example, maybe angle B corresponds to angle B, angle A corresponds to angle E, and angle C corresponds to angle D. But that's what I thought before. But if that gives BD = BC = 7.5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the similarity is different. Maybe the order is different. Let me check.

In similarity statements, the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So if triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle B, angle C corresponds to angle D. Therefore, AB corresponds to EB, BC corresponds to BD, and AC corresponds to ED. Hence, AB/EB = BC/BD = AC/ED. As AC = ED = 9, so AC/ED = 1. Therefore, AB = EB and BC = BD. But AB is 6, so EB is 6. BC is 7.5, so BD is 7.5. But that doesn't match the answer choices. Therefore, something is wrong here.

Wait, but maybe the correspondence is different. Suppose triangle ABC ~ triangle EDB instead? Let me see. If the similarity was triangle ABC ~ triangle EDB, then angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle D, angle C corresponds to angle B. But that may not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is A→E, B→B, C→D. Wait, but even so, same conclusion.

Hmm, maybe there's an error in my understanding of the similarity. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D))", which is written as Triangle(A,B,C) ~ Triangle(E,B,D). So the correspondence is A→E, B→B, C→D. Thus, the ratio AB/EB = BC/BD = AC/ED. Since AC = ED = 9, so AC/ED = 1. Therefore AB/EB = 1 => EB = AB = 6. BC/BD = 1 => BD = BC = 7.5. But 7.5 is not one of the answer choices. So either there's a miscalculation, or my correspondence is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is not between ABC and EBD, but between ABC and another triangle? Wait, no—the problem states "Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D)".

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the correspondence. Let me think again. If the triangles are similar, then the order of the vertices defines the correspondence. So vertex A in ABC corresponds to E in EBD, vertex B corresponds to B, vertex C corresponds to D. So that would mean angle at B in ABC corresponds to angle at B in EBD. But then angle at B in ABC is split by BF into two angles. If triangle EBD includes angle at B, which is the same as angle at B in ABC? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is not in that order. What if triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD in a different way? Like angle B corresponds to angle E, angle A corresponds to angle B, etc.? Wait, but without knowing the exact correspondence, it's hard to tell. Maybe I need to use other given information to figure out the correct correspondence.

Another given is that AC is parallel to ED. Since AC || ED, and AC = ED, which suggests that these two segments are congruent and parallel, making them the bases of a parallelogram. But since AC is connected to A and C, and ED is connected to E and D. So maybe AECD is a parallelogram? But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Additionally, there's a right angle at Angle(A,F,B) and Angle(E,F,D). So Angle(A,F,B) is a right angle, meaning that lines AF and BF are perpendicular. Similarly, Angle(E,F,D) is a right angle, so lines EF and DF are perpendicular? Wait, no. The angle at F between E and D is a right angle. So at point F, angle EFD is a right angle. So line FE and FD form a right angle at F.

Also, BF bisects angle ABC, and there's a right angle at AFB. So triangle AFB is a right triangle with right angle at F. So AF ⊥ BF. Since BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC.

Now, considering the angle bisector theorem. If BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, then the ratio of AB to BC is equal to the ratio of AF to FC. Wait, but earlier I thought that F might not be on AC. However, since AF is a line from A to F, and BF is from B to F, perhaps F is located such that AF intersects BC? No, not necessarily. Wait, but if BF is the angle bisector, then it should meet AC at some point. Unless F is not on AC. Wait, but the problem states that there's a line FA, so F is connected to A. So maybe F is a point outside of triangle ABC?

This is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the similarity between triangles ABC and EBD. If they are similar, then their sides are proportional. But since AC and ED are equal and parallel, maybe the ratio is 1, implying that BD is equal to BC, which is 7.5, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption about the correspondence is wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's look for other relationships. Since AC || ED and AC = ED, then maybe quadrilateral ACDE is a parallelogram. If that's true, then AD would be equal to EC and AE would be equal to CD. But I don't know if that's the case. Also, given that there's a right angle at Angle(E,F,D), which could imply that ED is perpendicular to DF. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate BD. Let me try that.

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BA = 6, let me assume point A is along the x-axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s place point B at (0,0).

Since BA = 6, let me put point A at (6,0).

Now, angle ABC is being bisected by BF. Let me find coordinates for point C. Since BC = 7.5, and angle at B is being bisected by BF. Also, AC = 9.

Wait, but without knowing the coordinates of C, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC. Since we know AB = 6, BC = 7.5, and AC = 9. Let me compute angle at B.

Using Law of Cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle ABC)

Plugging numbers:

9² = 6² + 7.5² - 2*6*7.5*cos(angle ABC)

Calculating:

81 = 36 + 56.25 - 90 * cos(angle ABC)

Total of 36+56.25 = 92.25

Thus:

81 = 92.25 - 90 * cos(angle ABC)

Rearranged:

90 * cos(angle ABC) = 92.25 - 81 = 11.25

cos(angle ABC) = 11.25 / 90 = 0.125

Therefore angle ABC = arccos(0.125) ≈ 82.819 degrees.

Since BF bisects angle ABC, each of the two angles formed is approximately 41.4 degrees.

Now, since BF is the angle bisector, and AF is connected to point A, and BF connects to F. Also, there's a right angle at AFB, which means that triangle AFB is right-angled at F. So in triangle AFB, angle at F is 90 degrees.

So, in triangle AFB, with right angle at F, and angle at B being half of angle ABC, which we found as approx 41.4 degrees. Therefore, angle at A in triangle AFB is 90 - 41.4 = 48.6 degrees.

Using trigonometry in triangle AFB: tan(angle at B) = AF / BF. Wait, but I need more relations.

Alternatively, since triangle AFB is right-angled at F, then AF² + BF² = AB² = 6² = 36.

But I don't know AF or BF yet.

But since BF is the angle bisector, perhaps using the angle bisector formula. Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that AF / FC = AB / BC. Wait, but earlier confusion arises because F might not be on AC. However, if BF is the angle bisector, then in triangle ABC, the angle bisector from B would meet AC at some point. But since F is connected to A and B, maybe F is that intersection point?

Wait, if F is the intersection of the angle bisector BF with AC, then yes. So in that case, F lies on AC, and AF / FC = AB / BC = 6 / 7.5 = 4 / 5.

But we also know that AC = 9, so AF + FC = 9. Let me denote AF = 4k, FC = 5k. Then 4k + 5k = 9 → k = 1. So AF = 4, FC = 5. Wait, but then AF would be 4 units long. But then, since triangle AFB is right-angled at F, we can use Pythagoras: AF² + BF² = AB² → 4² + BF² = 6² → BF² = 36 - 16 = 20 → BF = sqrt(20) = 2√5 ≈ 4.472.

But then, how does this relate to other parts of the diagram?

Also, since AC is parallel to ED, and AC = 9, DE = 9. So if AC || ED and AC = DE, then maybe ED is a translation of AC? Or maybe there's a parallelogram involved.

Additionally, there's a right angle at Angle(E,F,D), which is at point F. So angle EFD is 90 degrees. So FE ⊥ FD.

Moreover, there's a similarity between triangle ABC and triangle EBD. Let's revisit that. If triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then the ratio of sides is AB / EB = BC / BD = AC / ED. We know AC = ED = 9, so AC/ED = 1. Therefore, AB / EB = 1 → EB = AB = 6, and BC / BD = 1 → BD = BC = 7.5. But 7.5 isn't an option. So this suggests that my assumption about the correspondence is wrong.

Wait, maybe the similarity is not between ABC and EBD, but between ABC and another triangle? Wait, the problem says "Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D)", so it's definitely ABC ~ EBD.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. Suppose triangle ABC ~ triangle BED instead? Then the correspondence would be A→B, B→E, C→D. But that would require checking.

Let me try that. If triangle ABC ~ triangle BED, then AB / BE = BC / ED = AC / BD. Given AC = 9, ED = 9, so AC / ED = 1. Therefore, AB / BE = 1 → BE = AB = 6. BC / ED = 7.5 / 9 = 5/6. So AC / BD = 1 → BD = AC = 9. But 9 isn't an option either. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the similarity involves different correspondence. Let me think differently. Suppose triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD with a different correspondence. For instance, angle at B in ABC corresponds to angle at E in EBD. But without knowing the exact correspondence, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that AC || ED and AC = ED, leading to some parallelogram or trapezoid. If AC || ED and AC = ED, then maybe AECD is a parallelogram? If that's true, then AE = CD and AD = EC. But I don't know where points D and E are located.

Wait, the lines given include CD, DE, EF, FA. So starting from C, going to D, then to E, then to F, then to A. So the polygon is C-D-E-F-A-C? Or some other shape. But with the right angles at AFB and EFD.

Alternatively, since AC || ED and AC = ED, and there's a right angle at EFD, which is part of the structure. 

Maybe I should focus on the coordinates approach again. Let me try to assign coordinates based on previous assumptions.

Earlier, I placed B at (0,0), A at (6,0). Now, if F is the intersection of the angle bisector BF with AC, then F lies on AC. From earlier calculation, AF = 4, FC = 5. So AC is from A(6,0) to C. Let me find coordinates of C.

Since AC = 9, and AF = 4, FC = 5. Coordinates of F can be determined. Let me parametrize AC. Let me assume coordinates of C as (x,y). Then vector AC is from A(6,0) to C(x,y), and F divides AC in ratio AF:FC = 4:5. So coordinates of F are [(5*A + 4*C)]/(4+5) = [5*(6,0) + 4*(x,y)] /9.

But since F is also connected to B(0,0), and BF is the angle bisector. Additionally, triangle AFB is right-angled at F. So vector AF · vector BF = 0.

Let me express coordinates of F. Let me denote coordinates of C as (x,y). Then AC has length 9, so √[(x-6)^2 + y^2] = 9. Also, from earlier, AF = 4, FC = 5, so the coordinates of F can be expressed as follows:

F_x = (5*6 + 4*x)/9

F_y = (5*0 + 4*y)/9 = (4y)/9

Since BF is the line from B(0,0) to F(F_x, F_y), and triangle AFB is right-angled at F. Therefore, vectors AF and BF are perpendicular.

Vector AF = F - A = (F_x - 6, F_y - 0) = ((5*6 + 4x)/9 - 6, 4y/9)

Simplify F_x - 6: (30 + 4x)/9 - 54/9 = (4x - 24)/9

So vector AF = ((4x - 24)/9, 4y/9)

Vector BF = F - B = (F_x, F_y) = ((5*6 + 4x)/9, 4y/9)

Their dot product should be zero:

AF · BF = [(4x - 24)/9] * [(5*6 + 4x)/9] + [4y/9] * [4y/9] = 0

Multiply through by 81 to eliminate denominators:

(4x - 24)(5*6 + 4x) + 16y² = 0

Calculate 5*6 = 30, so:

(4x - 24)(4x + 30) + 16y² = 0

Expand the product:

4x*4x + 4x*30 - 24*4x - 24*30 = 16x² + 120x - 96x - 720 = 16x² + 24x - 720

So total equation:

16x² + 24x - 720 + 16y² = 0 → Divide all terms by 8:

2x² + 3x - 90 + 2y² = 0 → 2x² + 2y² + 3x - 90 = 0

Additionally, we know that AC has length 9, so (x - 6)^2 + y² = 81

Expand this: x² - 12x + 36 + y² = 81 → x² + y² = 45 + 12x

Substitute x² + y² = 45 + 12x into the previous equation:

From 2x² + 2y² + 3x - 90 = 0 → 2(x² + y²) + 3x - 90 = 0 → 2(45 + 12x) + 3x - 90 = 0 → 90 + 24x + 3x - 90 = 0 → 27x = 0 → x = 0

Wait, x = 0? That would place point C at x=0. Let's check this.

If x = 0, then from x² + y² = 45 + 12x → 0 + y² = 45 + 0 → y² = 45 → y = ±3√5

So coordinates of C are (0, 3√5) or (0, -3√5). Let's take positive y for simplicity, so C is (0, 3√5).

Now, let's verify if this satisfies the earlier equation.

With x=0, substitute back into the equation 2x² + 2y² + 3x - 90 = 0 → 0 + 2*45 + 0 -90 = 90 -90 = 0. Correct.

So coordinates of C are (0, 3√5). Now, coordinates of F can be computed.

F_x = (5*6 + 4x)/9 = (30 + 4*0)/9 = 30/9 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333...

F_y = 4y/9 = 4*(3√5)/9 = (12√5)/9 = 4√5/3 ≈ 2.981...

So F is at (10/3, 4√5/3).

Now, we need to find coordinates of D and E such that ED is parallel to AC, and ED = 9, and there's a right angle at EFD.

First, AC has coordinates from A(6,0) to C(0,3√5). The slope of AC is (3√5 - 0)/(0 - 6) = (3√5)/(-6) = -√5/2. Since ED is parallel to AC, it has the same slope.

Also, ED has length 9. Let's assume point E and D are positioned such that ED is parallel to AC and has length 9. Also, there's a right angle at EFD, which is at point F(10/3, 4√5/3).

Let me attempt to find coordinates of E and D. Since ED is parallel to AC, direction vector of ED is same as AC. Vector AC is (-6, 3√5). So direction vector is (-6, 3√5), which simplifies to (-2, √5) after dividing by 3.

So the line ED has direction (-2, √5). Let me parameterize ED. Let me denote point E as (e_x, e_y), and D as (d_x, d_y). The vector ED = (d_x - e_x, d_y - e_y) = k*(-2, √5), where k is a scalar such that |ED| = 9. The length of the vector (-2, √5) is √[4 + 5] = √9 = 3. So to get length 9, k must be 3. Thus, ED vector is (-6, 3√5). So d_x = e_x -6, d_y = e_y + 3√5.

But we also need to satisfy the condition that angle EFD is a right angle. Point F is fixed at (10/3, 4√5/3). So vectors FE and FD should be perpendicular.

Vector FE = E - F = (e_x - 10/3, e_y - 4√5/3)

Vector FD = D - F = (d_x - 10/3, d_y - 4√5/3)

Their dot product should be zero.

But since d_x = e_x -6, d_y = e_y + 3√5, substitute:

FE = (e_x - 10/3, e_y - 4√5/3)

FD = (e_x -6 - 10/3, e_y + 3√5 - 4√5/3) = (e_x - 28/3, e_y + (9√5/3 - 4√5/3)) = (e_x - 28/3, e_y + 5√5/3)

Dot product FE • FD = 0:

(e_x - 10/3)(e_x - 28/3) + (e_y - 4√5/3)(e_y + 5√5/3) = 0

Expand:

First term: (e_x - 10/3)(e_x - 28/3) = e_x² - (10/3 + 28/3)e_x + (10/3)(28/3) = e_x² - 38/3 e_x + 280/9

Second term: (e_y - 4√5/3)(e_y + 5√5/3) = e_y² + (5√5/3 e_y - 4√5/3 e_y) - (4√5/3)(5√5/3) = e_y² + (√5/3 e_y) - (20*5)/9 = e_y² + (√5/3 e_y) - 100/9

Combine both terms:

e_x² - 38/3 e_x + 280/9 + e_y² + √5/3 e_y - 100/9 = 0

Simplify constants: 280/9 - 100/9 = 180/9 = 20

So overall:

e_x² + e_y² - 38/3 e_x + √5/3 e_y + 20 = 0

Now, we need to find e_x and e_y such that this equation holds. But we also know that ED has length 9, which we already used to define the relation between e_x and d_x, d_y. But how do we find e_x and e_y?

Alternatively, since ED is parallel to AC and has length 9, and we have coordinates for E and D related by the vector (-6, 3√5), perhaps there are infinite possibilities, but we need to ensure that the right angle condition is satisfied. However, this seems too vague. Maybe there's another relationship from the similarity between triangles ABC and EBD.

Recall earlier attempts suggested that similarity might give BD = ? But with current coordinates, let's try to find D.

Assuming that triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD. Earlier, the correspondence was unclear, but let's try with the current coordinates.

Coordinates of B are (0,0), C is (0, 3√5), A is (6,0). So triangle ABC has points A(6,0), B(0,0), C(0, 3√5). Now, triangle EBD should be similar to this. Let's suppose EBD corresponds to ABC, so E corresponds to A, B corresponds to B, D corresponds to C. So triangle EBD ~ triangle ABC with correspondence E→A, B→B, D→C. So similarity ratio is EB / AB = BD / BC = ED / AC.

Given AC = 9, ED = 9, so ED / AC = 1. Thus, EB / AB = 1 → EB = AB = 6. Also, BD / BC = 1 → BD = BC = 7.5. But earlier, this leads to BD = 7.5, which isn't an option. But since this is conflicting, perhaps the correspondence is different.

Alternatively, if the similarity is triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD with correspondence A→E, B→B, C→D, then the ratio AB / EB = BC / BD = AC / ED = 1. So EB = AB = 6, BD = BC = 7.5. But again, this doesn't fit the answer choices.

But since we have coordinates for B at (0,0), and we're trying to find D, which is part of triangle EBD. Let me assume that D is at (d_x, d_y). If BD is supposed to be 7.5, then distance from B(0,0) to D(d_x, d_y) is 7.5. So sqrt(d_x² + d_y²) = 7.5 → d_x² + d_y² = 56.25.

But from earlier, we have the equation from the right angle condition: e_x² + e_y² - 38/3 e_x + √5/3 e_y + 20 = 0. But I'm not sure how to connect this with D's coordinates.

Alternatively, since ED is parallel to AC, and we've defined ED as having vector (-6, 3√5), then point D is E plus this vector. So if we can find E such that the right angle condition holds, then we can find D.

But how? Without additional constraints, it's underdetermined. Perhaps there's another relationship from the similarity.

Let me try to use the similarity again. Assume triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD with AB / EB = BC / BD = AC / ED = 1. So EB = AB = 6, BD = BC = 7.5. So BD is 7.5, but this is not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or my assumption about the correspondence is wrong.

Wait, but the answer choices are A.12, B.13.5, C.15, D.18. These are multiples of 7.5 (which is 15/2). Let me think: 7.5 * 2 = 15, which is option C. Maybe BD is twice BC? Or some other factor.

Wait, if the similarity ratio is not 1, but something else. Let me reconsider the similarity. If triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then AB / EB = BC / BD = AC / ED. We know AC = ED = 9, so AC/ED = 1, hence AB/EB = 1 and BC/BD = 1, which gives EB = AB = 6 and BD = BC = 7.5. But since this is not an option, perhaps the similarity is between ABC and BDE, or another arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is triangle ABC ~ triangle BDE, with AB / BD = BC / DE = AC / BE. Let me try this. If AB / BD = BC / DE, then 6 / BD = 7.5 / 9 → 6 / BD = 5/6 → BD = 6 * 6 /5 = 36/5 = 7.2, still not matching.

Alternatively, if it's triangle ABC ~ triangle DBE, then AB / DB = BC / BE = AC / DE. So 6 / DB = 7.5 / BE = 9 / 9 = 1. So 7.5 / BE = 1 → BE = 7.5, and 6 / DB = 1 → DB = 6. Still not matching.

This suggests that my assumption about the similarity correspondence is incorrect. Perhaps the similarity is not between ABC and EBD, but between another pair. Let me double-check the original problem statement.

Original problem says: "Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D))" — so it's definitely ABC ~ EBD.

Wait, maybe the similarity is not direct, but with some rotation or reflection. Or perhaps the correspondence is A→E, B→D, C→B? Let me try that.

If triangle ABC ~ triangle EDB (with correspondence A→E, B→D, C→B), then AB / ED = BC / DB = AC / EB.

So AB / ED = 6 / 9 = 2/3.

BC / DB = 7.5 / DB.

AC / EB = 9 / EB.

So setting AB/ED = BC/DB:

2/3 = 7.5 / DB → DB = (7.5 * 3)/2 = 22.5 / 2 = 11.25, which is not an option.

Or setting AB/ED = AC/EB:

2/3 = 9 / EB → EB = 9 * 3 / 2 = 13.5, which is option B. But this would mean EB = 13.5, but how does that relate to BD?

Not sure. This approach is getting too convoluted. Let me think differently.

Since AC || ED and AC = ED, then the distance between AC and ED is constant. Also, since there's a right angle at EFD, which is at point F. Maybe using coordinates for E and D.

Earlier, we had point F at (10/3, 4√5/3). Let me assume that ED is parallel to AC, which has slope -√5/2. So the line ED has slope -√5/2. Let me find points E and D such that ED has length 9 and passes through some position, and forms a right angle at F.

Let me parameterize line ED. Let me assume that point E is somewhere, and D is 9 units away along the direction of AC. Let me choose a parameter t to represent the position of E.

But this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since we know the slope of ED is -√5/2, and length is 9, let me represent ED as a line with this slope passing through some point.

But how to determine where? Maybe using the right angle condition at F.

The condition is that vectors FE and FD are perpendicular. Let me consider FE and FD as vectors from F to E and F to D. Since ED is a line with direction vector (-6, 3√5) (as previously determined), then points E and D are separated by this vector.

Let me denote vector ED as v = (-6, 3√5). Let me say that E is at some point, and D = E + v.

Then, vectors FE = E - F, and FD = D - F = (E + v) - F = (E - F) + v.

For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:

FE • FD = (E - F) • (E - F + v) = 0

Expanding:

(E - F) • (E - F) + (E - F) • v = 0

Which means:

|E - F|² + (E - F) • v = 0

Let me denote vector w = E - F. Then:

|w|² + w • v = 0

This is a condition on vector w.

But I also know that the length of ED is 9, which is |v| = 9, which checks out since |v| = sqrt(36 + 45) = sqrt(81) = 9.

So, this condition |w|² + w • v = 0 must hold.

Let me express this in terms of coordinates. Let me assume E has coordinates (e_x, e_y). Then w = (e_x - F_x, e_y - F_y) = (e_x - 10/3, e_y - 4√5/3).

And v = (-6, 3√5).

So the condition becomes:

(e_x - 10/3)^2 + (e_y - 4√5/3)^2 + [(e_x - 10/3)(-6) + (e_y - 4√5/3)(3√5)] = 0

Expand this:

First, expand the square terms:

(e_x - 10/3)^2 + (e_y - 4√5/3)^2

Plus the dot product:

-6(e_x - 10/3) + 3√5(e_y - 4√5/3)

So combining all together:

(e_x - 10/3)^2 + (e_y - 4√5/3)^2 -6(e_x - 10/3) + 3√5(e_y - 4√5/3) = 0

Let me simplify term by term.

Let me denote u = e_x - 10/3, v = e_y - 4√5/3. Then the equation becomes:

u² + v² -6u + 3√5 v = 0

This is the equation of a circle. Completing the square:

u² -6u + v² + 3√5 v = 0

For u: u² -6u = (u - 3)^2 -9

For v: v² + 3√5 v = (v + (3√5)/2)^2 - ( (3√5)/2 )²

So:

(u - 3)^2 -9 + (v + (3√5)/2)^2 - (9*5)/4 = 0

Simplify:

(u - 3)^2 + (v + (3√5)/2)^2 = 9 + 45/4 = 36/4 + 45/4 = 81/4

So the locus of point E is a circle with center at (3, -3√5/2) and radius 9/2 = 4.5.

So point E lies on this circle. Now, since ED is a vector of (-6, 3√5), and D = E + v, then once we find E, D is determined.

But how to find E? We need another condition. Perhaps from the similarity between triangles ABC and EBD?

Let me recall that if triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD, then the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Assuming the correspondence is A→E, B→B, C→D, then AB/EB = BC/BD = AC/ED = 1, as before. But this leads to BD = BC = 7.5, which isn't an option. Alternatively, if the correspondence is different.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is triangle ABC ~ triangle BDE, with AB/BD = BC/DE = AC/BE. Let's try this. AB = 6, BC = 7.5, AC = 9, DE = 9.

So AB/BD = BC/DE → 6/BD = 7.5/9 → 6/BD = 5/6 → BD = (6 * 6)/5 = 36/5 = 7.2, still not matching.

Or if it's AB/BE = BC/BD = AC/ED, then AB/BE = AC/ED = 9/9 = 1 → BE = AB = 6, and BC/BD = 1 → BD = BC = 7.5.

Still same issue.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is not direct, but with a scale factor. Let me assume that triangle ABC ~ triangle EBD with scale factor k. Then AB/k = EB, BC/k = BD, AC/k = ED. Since AC = ED = 9, then k = AC/ED = 1, so again EB = AB = 6, BD = BC = 7.5.

This suggests that the answer should be 7.5, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the setup.

Wait, the answer choices are A.12, B.13.5, C.15, D.18. Let me check if there's a possibility that BD is 13.5, which is 7.5 * 1.8, or 6 * 2.25, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the similarity is not between ABC and EBD, but between ABC and another triangle, like ABD or something else. Let me recheck the problem statement: "Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D))" — it's definitely ABC ~ EBD.

Wait, perhaps the correspondence is A→B, B→E, C→D? Let me try that. Then AB/BE = BC/ED = AC/BD.

AB = 6, BE is unknown, BC = 7.5, ED = 9, AC = 9, BD is what we want.

So AB/BE = BC/ED → 6/BE = 7.5/9 → BE = 6 * 9 /7.5 = 54/7.5 = 7.2

And AC/BD = 9/BD = AB/BE = 6/7.2 = 5/6 → 9/BD = 5/6 → BD = 9 * 6 /5 = 54/5 = 10.8, not an option.

Nope.

Alternatively, if the correspondence is A→E, B→D, C→B. Then AB/ED = BC/DB = AC/EB.

AB = 6, ED = 9, BC = 7.5, DB is BD, AC = 9, EB is unknown.

So 6/9 = 7.5/BD → 2/3 = 7.5/BD → BD = 7.5 * 3 /2 = 11.25, not an option.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Maybe the error is in assuming that the similarity is ABC ~ EBD, but actually it's another pair. Let me check the original problem statement again.

The problem says: "Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,D))" — so it's definitely ABC ~ EBD. Maybe there's a misread in the problem? Or perhaps the similarity is not direct, but with a different correspondence.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates. We have point F at (10/3, 4√5/3). We also know that ED is parallel to AC, and has length 9. Let me try to find D such that BD is the desired length.

From earlier, we have D = E + v, where v is (-6, 3√5). Let me assume that E is on the circle we derived earlier: (u - 3)^2 + (v + (3√5)/2)^2 = (9/2)^2.

But without more information, it's difficult to determine E. However, perhaps there's a connection with the right angle at EFD and the similarity.

Alternatively, since we know AC || ED and AC = ED, and we have point F, maybe there's a parallelogram or some symmetry.

Wait, if AC || ED and AC = ED, then maybe AECD is a parallelogram, making AE = CD and AD = EC. If that's the case, then AD = EC. Let me see.

But I don't know where E and D are. Let me try to find
