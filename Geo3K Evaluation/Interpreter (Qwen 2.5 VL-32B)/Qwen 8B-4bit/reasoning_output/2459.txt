Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the figure they describe. 

So, we have a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLPR. Let me sketch this mentally. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So points J, K, L, M form a rectangle. That means sides JK, KL, LM, MJ are all straight lines, each pair of adjacent sides forming 90-degree angles. Also, since it's a rectangle, diagonals like JM and KL should bisect each other but aren't necessarily equal unless it's a square. Wait, but rectangles have diagonals of equal length.

Then there's a rhombus MLPR. A rhombus has all sides equal, so MP, PR, RL, and LM are all equal. Also, opposite angles in a rhombus are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. But wait, the points mentioned here are M, L, P, R. So the rhombus is connected as M-L-P-R-M? Or maybe M-P-R-L-M? Wait, the lines given are Line(M,P), Line(P,R), Line(R,L), Line(L,P). Wait, the rhombus is MLPR, so the order would be M connected to L, L connected to P, P connected to R, R connected back to M? Or perhaps another arrangement? Let me check the lines again. 

Given lines for the rhombus: Line(M,P), Line(P,R), Line(R,L), Line(L,P). Wait, that seems like the rhombus is formed by points M, P, R, L. Because Line(M,P) connects M to P, Line(P,R) connects P to R, Line(R,L) connects R to L, and Line(L,P) connects L back to P. So the rhombus is M-P-R-L-M? Wait, but then the sides would be MP, PR, RL, and LM. Wait, but LM is already part of the rectangle. Since LM is a side of the rectangle, and in the rhombus, LM is one of its sides. But in the rhombus, all sides are equal. So LM equals MP equals PR equals RL. Therefore, LM is equal to MP, which implies that MP equals LM. But LM is a side of the rectangle, so if LM is equal to MP, then MP must also be equal to LM, making MP equal to LM. 

Also, the problem mentions angles: ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, with measure of ∠JKM being 55 degrees, and measure of ∠MRP being 70 degrees. Need to find measure of ∠KLP. 

Let me try to visualize this. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me assume point J at origin (0,0). Since JKLM is a rectangle, suppose K is at (a,0), L at (a,b), and M at (0,b). Then, the rectangle sides are horizontal and vertical. Now, the rhombus MLPR. Point M is (0,b), L is (a,b). The rhombus MLPR. So starting from M(0,b) to L(a,b), then to P, then to R, then back to M. Wait, but the lines given are Line(M,P), Line(P,R), Line(R,L), Line(L,P). Wait, so the rhombus is M connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to L, and L connected back to P? Hmm, that forms a rhombus MLPR where sides are MP, PR, RL, and LM? Wait, but LM is already a side of the rectangle. Wait, but LM is from L(a,b) to M(0,b), which is horizontal. But in the rhombus, the side RL would be from R to L(a,b). And PR is from P to R, and MP is from M(0,b) to P. So the rhombus has sides MP, PR, RL, and LM. Wait, but LM is part of the rectangle, so that suggests that LM is equal in length to MP, PR, RL. So LM is horizontal, length a. So MP must also have length a. So point P must be somewhere such that distance from M(0,b) to P is a. Similarly, PR must be same length, etc. But this might get complicated without coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe focus on angles. Given that ∠JKM is 55°, and ∠RMP is also 55°, but ∠MRP is 70°. Wait, the problem says m∠JKM = 55°, and m∠MRP = 70°, and those two angles are congruent? Wait, no, the first says ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, so their measures are equal. Wait, but the problem states that m∠JKM = 55°, and m∠MRP = 70°. Wait, maybe there was a typo? Wait, original problem says:

"m∠JKM = 55, and m∠MRP = 70."

Wait, but the congruence is between ∠JKM and ∠RMP. Wait, maybe there's confusion in notation. Let me recheck:

Original problem says: ∠JMK ≅ ∠RMP, m∠JMK = 55, and m∠MRP = 70. Find m∠KLP.

Wait, ∠JMK is angle at M between J and K. So vertex at M, with segments MJ and MK. Wait, but in the rectangle, J, K, L, M are vertices. So MJ is a diagonal of the rectangle? Because in rectangle JKLM, the diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, no, if it's a rectangle, the diagonals are connecting opposite corners. So if the rectangle is J-K-L-M-J, then diagonals are J-L and K-M. So point M is connected to K via diagonal? Wait, but the problem says that Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(L,M), Line(M,J) are present. So the rectangle is J-K-L-M-J, making it a rectangle with sides JK, KL, LM, MJ. So the diagonals would be JL and KM. Therefore, the diagonal from M to K would be the diagonal connecting M to K. So in that case, ∠JMK is the angle at M between points J, M, K. So that's the angle between MJ and MK. Since MJ is a side of the rectangle? No, MJ is a side of the rectangle. Wait, MJ is one of the sides of the rectangle. Wait, the rectangle has sides JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So MJ is a side. So point M is connected to J, so segment MJ is a side of the rectangle. Then, point K is connected to J and L. So the angle ∠JMK is at point M, between points J, M, K. So that's the angle between MJ (which is a side of the rectangle) and MK (the diagonal from M to K). So in the rectangle, the diagonal from M to K splits the angle at M. Wait, but in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So if you draw diagonal MK, then angle at M between MJ and MK would depend on the rectangle's proportions. 

But according to the problem, this angle (∠JMK) is 55 degrees. Also, ∠RMP is congruent to ∠JMK, so it's also 55 degrees. However, the measure of ∠MRP is given as 70 degrees. So ∠MRP is at point R, between points M, R, P. 

We need to find m∠KLP. Which is the angle at point L between points K, L, P. So ∠KLP is at L, between K, L, P. 

First, let's note down all given angles and relations:

- ∠JMK ≅ ∠RMP → both 55°
- m∠JMK = 55°
- m∠MRP = 70°
- Also, the rectangle has right angles at each corner, so ∠JKL, ∠KLM, etc., are 90°
- The rhombus MLPR has sides MP, PR, RL, LM all equal. Also, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So ∠MLP and ∠MRL are equal, and ∠MPR and ∠LRP are equal, etc. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles. 

Now, trying to find ∠KLP. Let's think about triangle KLP. To find that angle, maybe we can find some relationships between the triangles involved. 

Since MLPR is a rhombus, then LP is a side of the rhombus. Wait, MLPR is a rhombus. So sides ML, LP, PR, RM are all equal. Wait, ML is a side of the rectangle. So ML is equal to LP, which is equal to PR, etc. 

Also, since ML is a side of the rectangle, which has length equal to the side of the rectangle. Let me denote the rectangle's sides. Suppose the rectangle has length JK = KL = a, and width JM = ML = b. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if J is at (0,0), K at (a,0), L at (a,b), and M at (0,b). Then, ML is the vertical side from M(0,b) to L(a,b)? Wait, no, ML would be from M(0,b) to L(a,b), which is horizontal. Wait, in that case, ML would be of length a, same as JK. Then, the rhombus MLPR has sides ML, LP, PR, RM. So ML is length a, so LP, PR, RM must also be length a. 

Therefore, point P is such that MP = a. Since M is at (0,b), and P is connected to M and to L. Wait, but in the rhombus MLPR, the connections are M-P, P-R, R-L, L-P. So from M to P, then P to R, then R to L, then L back to P. So P is connected to both M and L. Wait, but in the rectangle, L is at (a,b). So if P is connected to L and M, then P lies somewhere such that PL and PM are both length a. Wait, because in the rhombus, ML is length a, so PL must be length a. So from point L(a,b), moving a distance a in some direction to point P. Similarly, from M(0,b) to P, distance a. So coordinates of P satisfy:

Distance from M(0,b) to P(x,y): sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-b)^2) = a.

Distance from L(a,b) to P(x,y): sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2) = a.

So these equations imply that P lies at intersection points of two circles: center at M(0,b) radius a, and center at L(a,b) radius a. Solving these equations:

(x)^2 + (y - b)^2 = a^2,

and 

(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = a^2.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

(x - a)^2 - x^2 = 0 → expanding: x² - 2ax + a² - x² = -2ax + a² = 0 → -2ax + a² = 0 → x = a/2.

So x-coordinate of P is a/2. Plugging back into first equation:

(a/2)^2 + (y - b)^2 = a^2 → (a²)/4 + (y - b)^2 = a² → (y - b)^2 = (3a²)/4 → y - b = ±(√3 a)/2 → y = b ± (√3 a)/2.

Thus, there are two possible positions for P: above or below the line ML. However, since the rhombus MLPR is connected to R, which is connected to P and R. Considering the rectangle is drawn in standard position, likely P is above ML, but depends on the diagram. However, given that ∠MRP is 70°, which is an angle inside the rhombus, we need to see which position makes sense.

Assuming that the rhombus is constructed upwards from ML, so P is above ML. Thus, coordinates of P are (a/2, b + (√3 a)/2). Alternatively, if it's downward, but then angle MRP may differ. Let me proceed assuming upward direction.

So coordinates:

M(0, b)

L(a, b)

P(a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 )

Then, point R is connected to P and L. From the rhombus MLPR, the next side after PR is RL, so R is connected to P and to L. Wait, the rhombus has sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So after PR comes RM. So from R, we go to M. So point R is connected to P and to M? Wait, no. The rhombus is MLPR, so the order is M -> L -> P -> R -> M? Wait, no, earlier analysis said that the lines are M-P, P-R, R-L, L-P. Wait, that would make the rhombus as M-P-R-L-M. So the sides are MP, PR, RL, and LM. Wait, but LM is already a side of the rectangle. So LM is from L(a,b) to M(0,b), which is horizontal. Then, PR is from P to R, RL is from R to L(a,b), and LM is from L to M. So the rhombus is M-P-R-L-M. Hence, sides MP, PR, RL, and LM. Therefore, PR must be equal to LM, which is length a. So PR is length a. So from point P(a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 ), moving to R such that PR = a. Also, since R is connected to L(a,b), then RL is a side of the rhombus, so RL = a. So R is located such that distance from R to L(a,b) is a, and distance from P to R is a. So similar to how P was found relative to M and L, R is determined by intersecting circles centered at L(a,b) and P(a/2, ...).

But maybe this coordinate approach is getting too involved. Perhaps focusing on angles instead.

Given that ∠JMK is 55°, which is the angle at M between J and K. Since J is at (0,0), K is at (a,0), M is at (0,b). So vector MJ is from M(0,b) to J(0,0): direction down along y-axis. Vector MK is from M(0,b) to K(a,0): direction towards (a,0). So the angle between MJ (downward vertical) and MK (diagonal to K) is 55 degrees. 

In this scenario, tan(angle JMK) would be the slope of MK relative to MJ. Since MJ is straight down, the angle between MK and MJ is 55 degrees. So the slope of MK is (change in y)/(change in x) = (0 - b)/(a - 0) = -b/a. The angle θ between MJ (straight down) and MK would correspond to arctangent of |slope|. Wait, but since the angle is measured from MJ to MK, which is going from downward vertical to the line MK. So the tangent of that angle would be opposite over adjacent, which would be the horizontal component over the vertical component. 

Wait, imagine standing at point M(0,b), looking down along MJ toward J(0,0). The line MK goes from M(0,b) to K(a,0). The angle between downward vertical (MJ) and MK is 55 degrees. So the slope of MK is rise over run, which is (-b)/a. The angle between the negative y-axis (MJ direction) and the line MK is 55 degrees. So tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = horizontal change / vertical change. Here, horizontal change is a units, vertical change is b units. So tan(theta) = a/b. Therefore, theta = arctan(a/b) = 55 degrees. So a/b = tan(55°). 

Similarly, we have ∠RMP = 55°, which is congruent to ∠JMK. So angle at M between R and P. Let's analyze ∠RMP. This is the angle at point M between points R and P. So vectors MR and MP. We need to find this angle. 

From earlier, we had point P located at (a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 ). Assuming that, then vector MP is from M(0,b) to P(a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 ), which is (a/2, (√3 a)/2 ). The length of MP is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + ( (√3 a)/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( a²/4 + 3a²/4 ) = sqrt(a²) = a, which matches the rhombus condition. 

Now, vector MR is from M(0,b) to R. Where is R? Since MLPR is a rhombus, and PR is a side of length a. From earlier, point R is connected to P and to L. So from point P(a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 ), moving to R such that PR = a and RL = a. Earlier, we saw that point R would be located symmetrically. For example, if we consider the rhombus MLPR, then since ML is horizontal, and MP is at 60 degrees from ML (since tan(theta)=a/b=tan(55°), but earlier calculation may vary). Wait, perhaps my assumption about coordinates for P needs refinement.

Alternatively, considering that in rhombus MLPR, the diagonals bisect the angles. So the diagonals of the rhombus are MR and LP. The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other. But maybe that's complicating things.

Back to angle ∠MRP = 70°, which is the angle at R between points M, R, P. So in triangle MRP, we know ∠MRP = 70°, and since MLPR is a rhombus, MP = PR = a. So triangle MPR has sides MP = PR = a, and angle at R is 70°, making it an isoceles triangle with base angles... Wait, no. In triangle MPR, sides MR and PR are not necessarily equal. Wait, MP = PR = a. So triangle MPR has sides MP = a, PR = a, and MR is the third side. So it's an isoceles triangle with sides MP = PR, so the base is MR, and the two equal sides are MP and PR. Therefore, the base angles at M and R are equal. Wait, but the given angle at R is 70°, which would mean the base angles are 70°, so the apex angle at P would be 180 - 2*70 = 40°. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.

Wait, but in triangle MPR, if MP = PR = a, then yes, it's isoceles with legs MP and PR. Therefore, angles opposite those legs would be equal. Wait, the angle at R is opposite MP, and angle at M is opposite PR. Wait, no: in triangle MPR, side MP is opposite angle R, side PR is opposite angle M, and side MR is opposite angle P. So if MP = PR, then angles opposite them (angle R and angle M) are equal. Therefore, angle at R (which is ∠MRP) equals angle at M (∠PMR). But the problem states that ∠MRP = 70°, so ∠PMR = 70°, making the remaining angle at P equal to 180 - 2*70 = 40°. So ∠MPR = 40°. 

Now, recall that ∠JMK = 55°, and ∠JMK is the angle at M between J and K. Which we previously linked to a/b = tan(55°). Also, ∠PMR is 70°, which is the angle at M between P and R. So total angle around point M?

Wait, at point M, we have several angles. The rectangle contributes a right angle at M (since it's a rectangle, angle KML is 90°). Wait, no: in the rectangle, the angle at M is between sides LM and MJ. Since LM is horizontal from L(a,b) to M(0,b), and MJ is vertical from M(0,b) to J(0,0). So the angle at M of the rectangle is 90°, between LM and MJ. 

But now, there's also the rhombus MLPR attached to point M. So at point M, we have the angle between LM and MJ (rectangle's angle, 90°), and also the angle between MJ and MP (from ∠JMK = 55°), and between MP and MR (from ∠PMR = 70°). Wait, but how do these angles fit together?

Let me think. At point M, the total angle is 360°, but within the plane, the sum of angles around a point is 360°. However, since we're dealing with planar figures, the angles around M would be parts of the rectangle and the rhombus. 

But in reality, the rectangle contributes a 90° angle at M between LM and MJ. Additionally, the rhombus introduces other angles at M. Specifically, from the rhombus MLPR, at point M, we have the side MP and the side ML. Wait, the rhombus has sides ML and MP. So the angle between ML and MP at point M is part of the rhombus. But in the rectangle, the angle between ML and MJ is 90°. So combining these, the total angle at M would involve the angle between ML and MP, plus the angle between MP and MJ, plus the angle between MJ and ML? Wait, no—need to clarify.

Actually, point M is connected to three lines: ML (part of the rectangle), MJ (part of the rectangle), and MP (part of the rhombus). So the angle between ML and MP is one angle, and between MP and MJ is another. However, the rectangle's angle at M is between ML and MJ, which is 90°. So the sum of angles between ML and MP, and between MP and MJ, must add up to 90°. 

Earlier, we had ∠JMK = 55°, which is the angle between MJ and MK. Wait, but MK is a diagonal of the rectangle. Wait, no, earlier analysis suggested that ∠JMK is the angle between MJ and MK, but MK is the diagonal from M to K. But if we consider the rhombus MLPR, then MP is a side of the rhombus. So the angle between MJ and MP is something else. 

This is getting confusing. Let me try to define variables for angles at point M. 

At point M, we have:

- The rectangle's internal angle: between LM and MJ, which is 90°.

- The rhombus MLPR adds an angle between ML and MP, and between MP and MR (since MLPR is a rhombus, the side MP connects to M and P, and the next side is PR, so from P to R, then R to L, etc.)

Wait, in the rhombus MLPR, the sides at M are ML and MP. So the angle between ML and MP at point M is one of the angles of the rhombus. In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is θ, the adjacent angle is 180° - θ. 

But we have ∠JMK = 55°, which is between MJ and MK. But MK is the diagonal of the rectangle. How does this relate to the angles at M?

Perhaps I need to consider triangle JMK. In triangle JMK, we have angle at M being 55°, and sides JM and MK. JM is a side of the rectangle, length b (if earlier coordinates were J(0,0), M(0,b)). MK is the diagonal of the rectangle, length sqrt(a² + b²). 

But maybe focusing on the angles at M:

Total angle at M is composed of the rectangle's angle (90°) and the angles introduced by the rhombus. However, since the rhombus is attached to the rectangle, perhaps overlapping? Or maybe the rhombus shares the side ML with the rectangle. 

Wait, ML is a side of the rectangle and a side of the rhombus. So at point M, the rhombus has sides ML and MP. So the angle between ML and MP is an angle of the rhombus. Let's call this angle α. Then, the other angle at point M in the rhombus would be between MP and MR, which would be supplementary to α, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. 

But the rectangle's angle at M is between ML and MJ, which is 90°. So if we consider the full picture, the angle between ML and MJ is 90°, and the angle between ML and MP is α. Then, the angle between MP and MJ would be 90° - α. 

But we also have ∠JMK = 55°, which is the angle between MJ and MK. So if we can express this angle in terms of α, we might find a relationship. 

Let me attempt to model this. Assume that at point M, the angle between ML and MP is α, and between MP and MJ is β. Then, α + β = 90°, since they are adjacent angles forming the rectangle's right angle. 

Now, ∠JMK is the angle between MJ and MK. Let's consider what MK represents. MK is the diagonal from M to K. In the rectangle, this diagonal divides the rectangle into two triangles. The angle between MJ and MK is 55°, which is given. 

To find β, which is the angle between MP and MJ, we need to relate it to ∠JMK. 

But how? Let me think. If I can find β, then since α + β = 90°, I can find α. Then, knowing α, which is an angle of the rhombus, allows us to use the fact that in the rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. 

But how does ∠MRP = 70° come into play? Earlier, in triangle MPR, we thought that ∠MRP = 70°, leading to ∠PMR = 70°, and ∠MPR = 40°. 

But ∠PMR is the angle at M between P and R, which would be α (angle between ML and MP) plus something? Wait, no. ∠PMR is the angle between PM and RM at point M. 

Wait, point R is part of the rhombus. From earlier, in the rhombus MLPR, the sides are MP, PR, RL, LM. So at point M, the sides are ML and MP. At point P, the sides are MP and PR. At point R, the sides are PR and RL. At point L, the sides are RL and LM. 

So, the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and MP, which is α. The angle at P in the rhombus is between MP and PR. 

Earlier, we considered triangle MPR, where ∠MRP = 70°, and if MP = PR = a, then ∠PMR = 70°, making ∠MPR = 40°. 

But ∠PMR is the angle at M between P and R, which would be the angle between MP and MR. But MR is a diagonal of the rhombus? Or another side? Wait, in the rhombus MLPR, MR is not a side; the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM? Wait, no. The rhombus is MLPR, so the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. Wait, RM is a side? From R to M. Yes. So at point M, the rhombus has sides ML and RM. Wait, but earlier I thought it had ML and MP. There's inconsistency here. 

Ah! This is critical. The rhombus MLPR has sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So at point M, the sides are ML and RM. So the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and RM. Previously, I mistakenly thought it was between ML and MP, but that's incorrect. The rhombus is M-L-P-R-M, so sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. Therefore, at point M, the sides are ML and RM. So the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and RM. 

This changes things. So the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and RM, which we'll call γ. In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if γ is the angle at M, then the angle at P would be 180° - γ. 

But we also have the rectangle's angle at M, which is between ML and MJ, which is 90°. So how does this relate to γ? 

At point M, the angle between ML and RM (γ) plus the angle between RM and MJ (let's say δ) equals the rectangle's angle of 90°, i.e., γ + δ = 90°. 

Additionally, we have ∠JMK = 55°, which is the angle between MJ and MK. Let me try to relate this. 

Let me consider triangle JMK. It has points J, M, K. We know angle at M is 55°, and sides MJ and MK. 

MJ is a side of the rectangle, length b. MK is the diagonal of the rectangle, length sqrt(a² + b²). 

Using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle JMK might help. But without knowing specific lengths, it's hard. Alternatively, using the earlier relation involving tan(theta) = a/b = tan(55°), as before. 

Wait, earlier, I thought that the angle between MJ (downward vertical) and MK (to point K) is 55°, giving tan(theta) = a/b = tan(55°). So a/b = tan(55°). 

Now, back to the rhombus angle γ at M. What is γ? It's the angle between ML and RM in the rhombus. Since ML is a side of the rectangle, and RM is a side of the rhombus. 

But what is RM? In the rhombus MLPR, RM is a side, so it has length equal to ML, which is a. So RM = a. 

So in triangle MRM? Wait, no, triangle MRM doesn't exist. Let me think about triangle MRL or something. 

Alternatively, consider triangle MRL. Wait, point R is part of the rhombus. If I can find some relationship between the angles here. 

But maybe focusing on the angle at M in the rhombus, γ. Since it's part of the rhombus, and the adjacent angle at P would be 180° - γ. 

Also, in triangle MPR, we have ∠MRP = 70°, and if MP = PR = a, then as before, the triangle MPR is isoceles with MP = PR, so angles at M and R are equal. Wait, but earlier I thought ∠MRP = 70°, which is at R, so if it's isoceles, then ∠PMR = ∠PRM = 70°, making ∠MPR = 40°. But ∠PMR is the angle at M between P and R, which is part of the rhombus angle γ. 

Wait, ∠PMR is the angle at M between P and R. But in the rhombus, the angle at M is between ML and RM. So if ∠PMR is part of that angle, then how? 

Maybe ∠PMR is the angle between PM and RM at point M. Since PM is a side of the rhombus (from M to P), and RM is another side (from M to R). Wait, but in the rhombus, the sides at M are ML and RM. So PM is not a side of the rhombus, but rather a diagonal or something else? 

Wait, no. Earlier, I thought that the rhombus is MLPR, with sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So at point M, the sides are ML and RM. So PM is not a side of the rhombus, but it's a connection from M to P, which is part of the rhombus. Wait, no, the rhombus has sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So from M, you go to L, then to P, then to R, then back to M. So the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. So PM is a diagonal of the rhombus, connecting M to P. 

Therefore, in the rhombus MLPR, the diagonals are MP and LR. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So MP and LR are the diagonals. 

Thus, the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and RM, which are two sides of the rhombus. The diagonals MP and LR intersect at some point, dividing the angles. 

So, in this case, the angle γ at M in the rhombus is split into two angles by diagonal MP. So if the angle between ML and RM is γ, then diagonal MP splits it into two angles. 

But how does this relate to ∠PMR, which is the angle at M between P and R? Wait, ∠PMR is the angle between PM and RM at point M. Since PM is a diagonal, and RM is a side of the rhombus. 

So, in the rhombus, the diagonal MP divides the angle γ at M into two parts. Let's call those parts x and y, such that x + y = γ. 

But we also have that in triangle MPR, ∠MRP = 70°, and if MP = PR = a, then as before, the triangle MPR has angles at M and R equal to 70°, making ∠MPR = 40°. 

But ∠MPR is the angle at P between M and R. 

However, I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I need to find γ, the angle at M in the rhombus, and relate it to the other angles. 

Since in the rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if γ is the angle at M, then the angle at P is 180° - γ. 

But in triangle MPR, we have ∠MRP = 70°, and if we can relate that to the rhombus angles. 

Alternatively, since MP is a diagonal of the rhombus, and in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So if γ is the angle at M, then diagonal MP bisects γ into two equal angles of γ/2. 

So, if the angle at M is γ, then the diagonal MP divides it into two angles of γ/2. 

But earlier, in triangle MPR, we have ∠PMR = 70°, which would be one of those halves. Wait, if ∠PMR is the angle between PM and RM, which is γ/2, then γ/2 = 70°, so γ = 140°. 

Wait, this seems promising. Let me elaborate. 

In the rhombus MLPR, the diagonal MP bisects the angle at M (γ). So the angle between MP and RM is γ/2. But this angle is ∠PMR, which is part of triangle MPR. If ∠MRP = 70°, and in triangle MPR, if we can determine other angles. 

Wait, earlier I thought that in triangle MPR, with sides MP = PR = a, the angles at M and R are equal. But if ∠MRP = 70°, then ∠PMR = 70°, and ∠MPR = 40°. But if ∠PMR is γ/2, then γ/2 = 70°, hence γ = 140°. 

So γ, the angle at M in the rhombus, is 140°. 

But the angle at M in the rhombus is γ = 140°, which is adjacent to the rectangle's angle of 90° at M. How does this fit? 

At point M, the angle between ML and RM is γ = 140°, and the rectangle's angle between ML and MJ is 90°. So the angle between RM and MJ would be 90° - γ? No, because γ is the angle between ML and RM, and the rectangle's angle is between ML and MJ. So the total angle around point M would be γ + something = 360°? No, in planar geometry, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but here we're considering the angles formed by the rectangle and the rhombus. 

Wait, at point M, there are two angles: one from the rectangle (between ML and MJ, 90°), and one from the rhombus (between ML and RM, γ=140°). These two angles are adjacent, sharing the side ML. So their sum would be the total angle between MJ and RM, which would be 90° + 140° = 230°? But that seems impossible because angles around a point can't exceed 360°, but this might be due to overlapping structures. 

Wait, no. Actually, the rectangle's angle at M is between ML and MJ, which is 90°. The rhombus's angle at M is between ML and RM, which is γ=140°. These two angles share the side ML, so the angle between MJ and RM would be the difference between γ and the rectangle's angle? Or sum? 

Wait, if you imagine point M, with ML extending horizontally to the right (assuming standard orientation), and MJ extending vertically down. The rhombus has a side RM making an angle γ=140° with ML. So the direction of RM is 140° from ML. Since ML is horizontal, RM would be 140° from ML, which would place it in a certain direction. 

But the rectangle's side MJ is vertical downward. So the angle between MJ and RM would be the difference between the angle of RM and the angle of MJ. 

Let me calculate this. If ML is horizontal, and γ is the angle between ML and RM, then RM is at an angle of γ from ML. Since MJ is vertical downward, which is 90° from ML (assuming ML is along positive x-axis). 

So the angle between MJ and RM would be |90° - γ| or something like that. 

If γ is 140°, then the angle between ML and RM is 140°, which would mean RM is pointing 140° counterclockwise from ML (assuming standard math angles). Since ML is along positive x-axis, RM would be at 140° from positive x-axis. The direction of MJ is along negative y-axis (downward), which is 270° from positive x-axis. 

The angle between RM (at 140°) and MJ (at 270°) would be 270° - 140° = 130°, but since angles wrap around, it's the smallest angle between them. Wait, the absolute difference is 130°, but since it's more than 180°, the smaller angle is 360° - 130° = 230°, which doesn't make sense. Wait, this indicates a mistake in assumptions. 

Alternatively, if γ is the angle between ML and RM, then depending on the direction of RM. If γ is 140°, then RM is at 140° from ML. Assuming ML is along positive x-axis, then RM is at 140°, which is in the second quadrant (upward-left). But MJ is downward along negative y-axis. So the angle between RM (second quadrant) and MJ (negative y-axis) would be 140° - 90° = 50°? Not sure. 

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to use the earlier conclusion that γ = 140°, based on triangle MPR having ∠PMR = 70°, which is half of γ. 

If γ = 140°, then the angle at M in the rhombus is 140°, which is adjacent to the rectangle's 90° angle. This suggests that the angle between RM and MJ is 140° - 90° = 50°? Or some other combination. 

But regardless, we need to find ∠KLP, which is the angle at L between K, L, P. Let's consider triangle KLP. Points K, L, P. 

Point K is at (a,0), point L is at (a,b), and point P is somewhere. From earlier, in the rhombus MLPR, P is at (a/2, b + (√3 a)/2 ) if we assume certain conditions. But this might not hold if γ is 140°. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus with ML = a, and angle at M is 140°, then using the law of cosines on the rhombus to find PR or other sides. Wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals can be calculated using the formula: d1 = 2*a*sin(θ/2), d2 = 2*a*cos(θ/2), where θ is one of the angles. 

Wait, for a rhombus with side length a and angle θ, the lengths of the diagonals are 2a sin(θ/2) and 2a cos(θ/2). 

But here, the angle at M is γ = 140°, so the diagonals would be:

d1 = 2a sin(γ/2) = 2a sin(70°)

d2 = 2a cos(γ/2) = 2a cos(70°)

These diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. 

But how does this help with finding ∠KLP? 

Point P is one of the vertices of the rhombus. To find ∠KLP, which is the angle at L between K, L, P. 

Point L is at (a,b). Point K is at (a,0). Point P is part of the rhombus MLPR. 

If I can find the coordinates of P, then I can compute vectors LK and LP, and find the angle between them. 

Assuming the rectangle has coordinates J(0,0), K(a,0), L(a,b), M(0,b). 

The rhombus MLPR has sides ML, LP, PR, RM. With ML = a, and angle at M is γ = 140°. 

To find coordinates of P, we can use the angle at M. 

Vector ML is from M(0,b) to L(a,b), which is (a, 0). 

The angle at M is 140° between ML and RM. So vector RM makes 140° with ML. 

Vector ML is along positive x-axis from M. So vector RM makes 140° with ML. Therefore, vector RM has direction 140° from positive x-axis. 

Length of RM is a (side of rhombus). So coordinates of R can be calculated as M + vector RM. 

But wait, vector RM starts at M and goes to R. So if the direction of RM is 140° from positive x-axis, then the coordinates of R are:

R_x = M_x + a * cos(140°)

R_y = M_y + a * sin(140°)

So R is at (0 + a*cos(140°), b + a*sin(140°)).

Once we have R, we can find P, since in the rhombus, LP is a side of length a, and PR is also length a. 

But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, since we know that in the rhombus MLPR, the diagonals are MP and LR. The diagonals intersect at O, the midpoint. 

The diagonal MP connects M(0,b) to P. The diagonal LR connects L(a,b) to R. Since diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of MP is the same as midpoint of LR. 

Let me find midpoint of LR: L(a,b) and R(x_R, y_R). Midpoint is ((
