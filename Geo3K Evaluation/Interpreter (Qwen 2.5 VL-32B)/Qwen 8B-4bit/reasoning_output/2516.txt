Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two triangles, RSV and TVS, which are congruent. We need to find the measure of angle TSV, which is labeled as x. Let me start by going through the given information step by step.

First, the predicates mention several points: R, S, V, T. They also talk about lines connecting these points. For example, Line(R,S), Line(R,V), Line(S,V), Line(T,V), Line(S,T), Line(R,T). So, there are multiple lines forming triangles. Then there are angles mentioned like Angle(R,S,V), Angle(R,V,S), Angle(S,V,T), etc. Also, some angles are right angles, specifically Angle(R,S,V) and Angle(T,V,S) are right angles. Wait, but wait—actually, looking back, the RightAngle predicates say RightAngle(Angle(R,S,V)) and RightAngle(Angle(T,V,S)). So those two angles are right angles.

Also, there's a congruence between triangles RSV and TVS. Since they're congruent, their corresponding parts should be equal. That includes angles and sides. But first, I need to make sure which parts correspond. Let me think about how the triangles are structured.

Let me sketch mentally the triangles. Triangle RSV has vertices R, S, V. Triangle TVS has vertices T, V, S. So, the order of the letters matters here. In triangle RSV, the vertices are R connected to S connected to V connected back to R. Similarly, triangle TVS has T connected to V connected to S connected back to T. 

Since the triangles are congruent, the correspondence of the vertices must be such that each part corresponds. So, if Triangle(R,S,V) ≅ Triangle(T,V,S), then the order of the vertices suggests that R corresponds to T, S corresponds to V, and V corresponds to S? Wait, maybe not. Because in congruence, the order of the letters determines the correspondence. So, Triangle ABC ≅ Triangle DEF means A corresponds to D, B to E, C to F.

So here, Triangle RSV ≅ Triangle TVS. Therefore, R corresponds to T, S corresponds to V, and V corresponds to S. Wait, but that would mean that the correspondence is R→T, S→V, V→S. Let me check that again. So, the first triangle is R-S-V, and the second is T-V-S. So, the order of the vertices is different. So, for congruence, the order of the vertices in the triangles must match. Therefore, the correspondence is R ↔ T, S ↔ V, V ↔ S? Wait, that seems confusing because S and V are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps it's R ↔ T, S ↔ S, V ↔ V? No, that doesn't fit. Maybe the triangles are arranged differently.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is R ↔ T, S ↔ V, V ↔ S. Wait, but that would imply that vertex V in the first triangle corresponds to vertex S in the second triangle. Hmm. This needs careful consideration.

But since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles and sides must be equal. So, let's note that in triangle RSV, the angles at R, S, V. In triangle TVS, the angles at T, V, S. So, if they are congruent, then angle at R in RSV corresponds to angle at T in TVS, angle at S corresponds to angle at V, and angle at V corresponds to angle at S. Wait, but that might not hold unless the correspondence is properly aligned.

Wait, another way: Since the triangles are named RSV and TVS, the order of the letters indicates the order of the vertices. So, for triangle RSV, the order is R, then S, then V. For triangle TVS, the order is T, then V, then S. So, the correspondence would be R → T, S → V, V → S. Therefore, side RS corresponds to TV, side SV corresponds to VS, and side VR corresponds to ST. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the sides.

In triangle RSV, sides are RS, SV, VR. In triangle TVS, sides are TV, VS, ST. So, if they are congruent, then RS = TV, SV = VS, VR = ST. But SV is the same as VS, so SV = VS. Which makes sense. So, the sides opposite the angles would correspond accordingly.

Now, considering the right angles. There are two right angles given: Angle(R,S,V) is a right angle, which is angle at S in triangle RSV. And Angle(T,V,S) is a right angle, which is angle at V in triangle TVS. Wait, let me confirm. Angle(R,S,V) is the angle at point S between points R, S, V. So that's angle at S in triangle RSV. Similarly, Angle(T,V,S) is the angle at point V between points T, V, S. So that's angle at V in triangle TVS.

Given that these angles are right angles, so in triangle RSV, angle at S is 90 degrees. In triangle TVS, angle at V is 90 degrees. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles must be equal. Therefore, angle at S in RSV (which is 90°) corresponds to angle at V in TVS (also 90°). So that checks out.

Now, the other angles. Let's consider the angles in both triangles. In triangle RSV, we know one angle is 90° at S. The other angles are at R and V. In triangle TVS, we know one angle is 90° at V. The other angles are at T and S.

We are told that MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)) is 78°. Wait, Angle(R,V,S) is the angle at V in triangle RSV. So that's angle at V in triangle RSV. So angle at V in RSV is 78°, and angle at S is 90°, so the third angle at R would be 180 - 90 -78 = 12°. Wait, but that's for triangle RSV.

Then, in triangle TVS, since it's congruent to RSV, the corresponding angles should be equal. So angle at V in TVS (which is 90°) corresponds to angle at S in RSV (which is 90°). Then, angle at T in TVS corresponds to angle at R in RSV, which was 12°, so angle at T in TVS is 12°, and angle at S in TVS corresponds to angle at V in RSV, which was 78°, so angle at S in TVS is 78°. Wait, but the question asks for measure of angle TSV, which is angle at S in triangle TVS. Wait, angle TSV is the angle at S in triangle TVS. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Angle TSV refers to the angle at point S, between points T, S, V. So in triangle TVS, angle at S is between T, S, V. So that's the same as angle at S in triangle TVS. Earlier, we thought that angle at S in TVS corresponds to angle at V in RSV. Wait, but earlier, we had that in triangle RSV, angle at S is 90°, angle at V is 78°, angle at R is 12°. Therefore, in triangle TVS, which is congruent to RSV, the angles should be the same. So angle at V in TVS is 90°, angle at T corresponds to angle at R (12°), and angle at S corresponds to angle at V in RSV (78°). Wait, but then angle at S in TVS would be 78°, so that would be angle TSV, which is 78°. But wait, the problem says that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is 78°. Wait, let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, the given predicates include Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78). So that's angle at S between V, S, T. Which is the same as angle TSV. So according to that, angle TSV is 78°, but that contradicts our previous conclusion. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me re-examine. The user provided several angle measures. Let me list them:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78): this is angle at V between R, V, S. So in triangle RSV, angle at V is 78°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,V,S)), 90): angle at V between T, V, S. Wait, but that's angle in triangle TVS at V, which is a right angle.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x): this is angle at S between T, S, V, which is angle TSV. So that's the angle we need to find.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78): angle at S between V, S, T. Wait, that's the same as angle TSV, which is x. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, no. Wait, angle(V,S,T) is the angle at S between V, S, T. So that's the same as angle TSV, which is x. But according to the given, equals that measure to 78. But that would suggest x=78, but that's not among the options. Wait, but that can't be right. There must be something wrong here.

Hold on, perhaps I misread the angle labels. Let me parse each angle carefully.

The given angles:

- Angle(R,S,V): this is the angle at S between R, S, V. So that's angle at S in triangle RSV. Given as a right angle.

- Angle(R,V,S): angle at V between R, V, S. So in triangle RSV, angle at V. Given as 78°.

- Angle(S,V,T): angle at V between S, V, T. Which is part of triangle TVS? Or maybe angle at V in triangle TVS?

Wait, let me take each angle:

Angle(R,S,V): vertex at S, between R and V. So yes, angle at S in triangle RSV.

Angle(R,V,S): vertex at V, between R and S. So angle at V in triangle RSV.

Angle(S,V,T): vertex at V, between S and T. So angle at V in triangle TVS? Or maybe part of another triangle?

Wait, the angle names follow the pattern: the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between A and C.

Therefore:

- Angle(R,S,V) is angle at S between R and V → angle at S in triangle RSV.

- Angle(R,V,S) is angle at V between R and S → angle at V in triangle RSV.

- Angle(S,V,T) is angle at V between S and T → angle at V in triangle TVS.

- Angle(T,V,S) is angle at V between T and S → same as above? Or is that angle at S?

Wait, no. Angle(T,V,S) would be angle at V between T and S. So that's angle at V in triangle TVS. So that's consistent with the right angle given for Angle(T,V,S).

Similarly, Angle(T,S,V) is angle at S between T and V → angle at S in triangle TVS. Which is the same as angle TSV, which is x. So the problem states that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x). So that's x. However, there's also Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78). Wait, Angle(V,S,T) is angle at S between V and T → same as angle at S in triangle TVS. So that's also x. Wait, but the problem says that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78). Therefore, x is 78? But that's not among the options. Wait, but the answer choices are A. 11, B. 11.5, C. 12, D. 12.5. So 78 isn't there. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait, maybe the angle measures are not directly given for x. Let me check again. The given predicates:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78): angle at V in triangle RSV is 78°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,V,S)), 90): angle at V in triangle TVS is 90°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x): angle at S in triangle TVS is x.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78): angle at S in triangle TVS is 78°. Wait, but that would imply x is 78, but that's not an option. So there's a contradiction here. So where is the error?

Ah! Wait, maybe Angle(V,S,T) is not the same as Angle(T,S,V)? Let me check:

Angle(V,S,T) is angle at S between V and T. So that's the same as angle at S in triangle TVS. Whereas Angle(T,S,V) is angle at S between T and V, which is the same as angle at S in triangle TVS. So they are the same angle. So why are both given? That suggests that there's a typo, or maybe I misread the angle names.

Wait, the user wrote:

"Angle(R,S,V)
Angle(R,V,S)
Angle(S,V,T)
Angle(T,V,S)
Angle(T,S,V)
Angle(V,S,T)"

And the Equals statements:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,V,S)), 90)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78)"

So, Angle(R,V,S) is 78°, Angle(T,V,S) is 90°, Angle(T,S,V) is x, and Angle(V,S,T) is 78°. But Angle(T,S,V) and Angle(V,S,T) are the same angle. Hence, this implies x = 78°, but that's not among the options. So clearly, something's wrong here. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angles.

Wait, maybe Angle(V,S,T) is a different angle. Let me double-check the notation. The angle name is written as Angle(A,B,C), which represents the angle at B. So Angle(V,S,T) would be the angle at S between V and T. So yes, same as Angle(T,S,V). So both are referring to the same angle. Therefore, the given info says that this angle is 78°, which would mean x=78. But that's impossible given the answer choices. So there must be a misunderstanding in the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the congruence of the triangles allows us to derive x through other means. Let me think again about the triangles.

Triangles RSV and TVS are congruent. So their corresponding angles are equal. Let's look at the angles in triangle RSV:

- At S: right angle (90°).
- At V: 78° (given).
- At R: 180 - 90 - 78 = 12°.

So, angles in triangle RSV are 90°, 78°, 12°.

Since the triangles are congruent, triangle TVS must have the same angles. Now, triangle TVS has:

- At V: right angle (90°).
- At T: corresponds to angle at R in RSV, which is 12°.
- At S: corresponds to angle at V in RSV, which is 78°.

So angle at S in triangle TVS is 78°, which is angle TSV. But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is 78°, which is the same as angle TSV. But the question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), which is the same as angle at S in triangle TVS, which is 78°, but that's not an option. So this suggests that either there's a miscalculation, or I've misinterpreted the correspondence.

Wait, but maybe the correspondence of the congruent triangles is different. Suppose instead that the correspondence is different. For example, maybe triangle RSV corresponds to triangle TVS with R→T, S→S, V→V? But that would make the triangles share points S and V, which may not make sense. Or maybe another correspondence.

Alternatively, perhaps the congruence is such that triangle RSV corresponds to triangle TVS with R→T, S→S, V→V? But that would require that the triangles are overlapping. Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is R→T, S→V, V→S. Let's see:

If triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS with R→T, S→V, V→S. Then:

- Angle at R in RSV corresponds to angle at T in TVS.
- Angle at S in RSV corresponds to angle at V in TVS.
- Angle at V in RSV corresponds to angle at S in TVS.

So, in triangle RSV:

- Angle at S (right angle) corresponds to angle at V in TVS. Which would be 90°, matching the given that Angle(T,V,S) is a right angle. So that works.

- Angle at V in RSV (78°) corresponds to angle at S in TVS. Which is angle TSV, which is x. So x would be 78°, but again, not in options. So this leads to the same issue.

But the problem gives another angle: MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is 78°, which would be the same as angle TSV. So this seems contradictory. Unless there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles aren't congruent in the way I thought. Let me check the congruence condition. The problem says Congruent(Triangle(R,S,V), Triangle(T,V,S)). So the triangles RSV and TVS are congruent. So their corresponding parts are equal.

Another approach: since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. Let's check the sides. Given Lengths:

- LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = 2y - 1
- LengthOf(Line(S,T)) = 24.5
- LengthOf(Line(V,T)) = 24
- Also, since triangles are congruent, corresponding sides should be equal.

For example, in triangle RSV and TVS:

Side RS corresponds to TV, side SV corresponds to VS, and side VR corresponds to ST.

But SV is the same as VS, so SV = VS. Therefore, length of SV equals itself. Not helpful.

But maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines to relate angles and sides. Wait, but we have some angles. Let me think.

In triangle RSV:

- Right angle at S (90°)
- Angle at V is 78°
- Angle at R is 12°
- Sides: RS, SV, VR.

Using trigonometry, if we assume some side lengths, maybe we can find relations. But we also have other given lengths: LengthOf(Line(S,T)) = 24.5, LengthOf(Line(V,T)) = 24. 

Wait, Line(S,T) is part of triangle TVS? Let me see. Points S and T are connected by a line. Similarly, Line(V,T) connects V and T. These lines might form parts of the triangles.

But since the triangles are congruent, their sides should be equal. For example, in triangle RSV and TVS:

RS corresponds to TV (since R→T, S→V, V→S?), so RS = TV. But LengthOf(Line(R,S)) is 2y - 1. And LengthOf(Line(T,V)) is 24. So if RS corresponds to TV, then 2y - 1 = 24. Solving for y: 2y = 25 => y = 12.5. But the question is about x, which is angle TSV. How does this help?

But maybe I can find more relations. Let's think:

In triangle RSV, right-angled at S. So by Pythagoras:

RS² + SV² = RV².

But we don't know the lengths of these sides yet. However, we do know that in triangle TVS, which is congruent to RSV, the sides should match. For instance, TV corresponds to RS, VS corresponds to SV, and ST corresponds to VR.

From the given, LengthOf(Line(S,T)) is 24.5, which is ST. Since ST corresponds to VR in triangle RSV. So VR = ST = 24.5. Also, LengthOf(Line(V,T)) is 24, which is TV. Since TV corresponds to RS in triangle RSV, so RS = TV = 24. Thus, RS = 24. From earlier, LengthOf(Line(R,S)) is 2y - 1, which equals RS. So 2y - 1 = 24 ⇒ y = (24 + 1)/2 = 25/2 = 12.5. So y = 12.5. But how does this help with finding x?

Now, in triangle RSV, right-angled at S, with legs RS = 24 and SV, and hypotenuse RV = 24.5. Using Pythagoras:

RS² + SV² = RV²  
24² + SV² = 24.5²  
SV² = 24.5² - 24²  
Calculate that:

24.5 squared is (24 + 0.5)^2 = 24² + 2*24*0.5 + 0.5² = 576 + 24 + 0.25 = 600.25  
24 squared is 576  
So SV² = 600.25 - 576 = 24.25  
Thus, SV = sqrt(24.25) = sqrt(97/4) = (√97)/2 ≈ 9.849...

But how does this help us with angle TSV (x)?

In triangle TVS, which is congruent to RSV, the sides are TV = RS = 24, VS = SV = √24.25, and ST = VR = 24.5. Now, in triangle TVS, which is right-angled at V (from the given Angle(T,V,S) being a right angle). Wait, no—the right angle is at V in triangle TVS. Because Angle(T,V,S) is right angle, which is angle at V. So triangle TVS is right-angled at V, with legs TV and VS, and hypotenuse TS.

Wait, TV is one leg (length 24), VS is another leg (sqrt(24.25)), and hypotenuse TS is 24.5. Let me verify this using Pythagoras:

TV² + VS² = 24² + 24.25 = 576 + 24.25 = 600.25, which is equal to TS² (24.5² = 600.25). So that checks out.

Now, in triangle TVS, right-angled at V, with legs TV = 24 and VS = sqrt(24.25), and hypotenuse TS = 24.5. We need to find angle at S, which is angle TSV (x). In triangle TVS, angle at S is opposite to TV (which is 24). So using trigonometry:

tan(x) = opposite / adjacent = TV / VS = 24 / sqrt(24.25)

Compute that:

sqrt(24.25) = sqrt(97/4) = (√97)/2 ≈ 9.849

So tan(x) = 24 / (sqrt(97)/2) = (24 * 2)/sqrt(97) = 48 / sqrt(97)

Rationalizing the denominator:

48 / sqrt(97) = (48√97) / 97 ≈ ?

But calculating the numerical value:

sqrt(97) ≈ 9.849

So 48 / 9.849 ≈ 4.875

Now, arctangent of approximately 4.875. What's arctan(4.875)?

Well, tan(78°) is approximately 4.7046 (since tan(60°)=√3≈1.732, tan(75°)=3.732, tan(80°)=5.671). So 4.875 is between 75° and 80°, closer to 78°. Let me calculate tan(78°):

Using calculator input, tan(78°) ≈ 4.7046. Our value is 4.875, which is higher, so angle x is slightly larger than 78°, say around 78.5°. But none of the options are close to that. The given answer options are 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5. None of these make sense. Wait, this suggests a problem.

Wait, but earlier we thought that angle TSV is 78°, but that led to inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in identifying which angle is x. Let me go back.

The question says: Find x, where Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x). Angle(T,S,V) is the angle at S between T and V. In triangle TVS, that's angle at S, which is what we were trying to compute. Earlier, using the right triangle TVS, we found that angle at S is arctan(TV / VS) = arctan(24 / sqrt(24.25)) ≈ 78.5°, which is roughly 78.5°, but the options don't include that. But the given also says that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78). So that angle is 78°, which would be the same as angle TSV. So this suggests that x is 78°, but that's not in the options. 

This contradiction implies that there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me review the problem statement again carefully.

Wait, the given includes:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78): angle at V in triangle RSV is 78°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,V,S)), 90): angle at V in triangle TVS is 90°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x): angle at S in triangle TVS.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78): angle at S in triangle TVS is 78°.

So according to the given, angle at S in triangle TVS is 78°, hence x = 78°, but this is not an option. So there's a conflict. But the problem must have a valid answer among the options. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe the triangles are not right-angled at V in triangle TVS? Let me recheck the RightAngle predicates. It says RightAngle(Angle(T,V,S)), which is angle at V between T and S. So that's the right angle in triangle TVS. So triangle TVS is right-angled at V. So its angles are 90°, and the other two angles sum to 90°. One of them is x (angle at S), and the other is angle at T.

Earlier, I computed that angle at S (x) is arctan(24 / sqrt(24.25)) ≈ 78.5°, but that conflicts with the given MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°. So this suggests that there's a discrepancy. But the given says that Angle(V,S,T) is 78°, which is the same as angle at S in TVS, implying x=78°, but that contradicts the calculation from the triangle. 

Wait, unless the triangle isn't right-angled? Let me check. The RightAngle(Angle(T,V,S)) is given, so it is right-angled. So why the discrepancy?

Maybe the lengths are not as I assumed. Let me recalculate the sides. 

We know that in triangle RSV, right-angled at S. RS = 24 (from TV = 24, as per congruence), SV is sqrt(24.25), and RV = 24.5. So in triangle TVS, right-angled at V, with legs TV = 24 and VS = sqrt(24.25), hypotenuse TS = 24.5.

Now, in triangle TVS, angle at S is x, and angle at T is the remaining angle. Let's calculate x using trigonometry.

In right-angled triangle TVS:

sin(x) = opposite / hypotenuse = TV / TS = 24 / 24.5 ≈ 0.9796

So x = arcsin(24 / 24.5) ≈ arcsin(0.9796) ≈ 78.5°, as before.

But the given says that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°, which is the same angle x. So this suggests that x is 78°, but our calculation shows it's approximately 78.5°. This inconsistency likely arises from rounding or miscalculations.

Wait, let's calculate 24 divided by 24.5 precisely:

24 / 24.5 = 24 / (49/2) = 48/49 ≈ 0.9795918...

arcsin(48/49) is approximately what? Let's recall that sin(78°) is approximately 0.9781, and sin(78.5°) is about sin(78°)+Δ. Let's calculate:

Let’s use a calculator-like approach. Let me recall that sin(78°) ≈ 0.9781, sin(78.5°) ≈ ?

Using small-angle approximation, let's denote θ = 78°, Δθ = 0.5°.

The difference between sin(78° + 0.5°) and sin(78°) is approximately cos(78°)*0.5° in radians.

Convert 0.5° to radians: 0.5 * π/180 ≈ 0.008727 radians.

cos(78°) ≈ cos(π/2 - 12°) = sin(12°) ≈ 0.2079.

So Δsin ≈ 0.2079 * 0.008727 ≈ 0.001815.

So sin(78.5°) ≈ 0.9781 + 0.0018 ≈ 0.9799, which is very close to our value of 0.9796. So the actual angle is slightly less than 78.5°, say 78.4°, which is still not matching the given 78°. 

However, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°, which is supposed to be x. This suggests that either there's a miscalculation or the problem assumes certain approximations. But since the options are 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, none of which are near 78°, there must be a fundamental error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the congruence is not between RSV and TVS, but between RSV and TVS with different correspondence. Maybe the correspondence is R→T, S→S, V→V? Let me try that. If triangles RSV and TVS are congruent with R→T, S→S, V→V, then:

- Corresponding sides: RS corresponds to TS, SV corresponds to SV, VR corresponds to VT.

But then, since SV corresponds to SV, it's the same segment. So that would mean that triangles RSV and TVS share side SV. But then, for congruence, other sides must match. For example, RS = TS, and VR = VT.

Given that Line(S,T) has length 24.5, which would be TS. And Line(V,T) has length 24, which would be VT. So if VR = VT = 24, and RS = TS = 24.5. But in triangle RSV, which is right-angled at S, RS = 24.5, SV = ?, and VR = 24. Using Pythagoras:

RS² + SV² = VR²  
24.5² + SV² = 24²  
Wait, this would give SV² = 24² - 24.5², which is negative, which is impossible. So this correspondence is invalid.

So this suggests that the initial assumption about the correspondence is incorrect. Let's try another correspondence.

Suppose the congruence is between RSV and TVS with R→V, S→T, V→S. Let's see:

- R→V, S→T, V→S.

So triangle RSV maps to triangle TVS via R→V, S→T, V→S.

Then, corresponding sides:

RS → VT, SV → TS, VR → ST.

So RS = VT, SV = TS, VR = ST.

Given that Line(V,T) is 24, which is VT. So RS = VT = 24. Line(S,T) is 24.5, which is TS. So SV = TS = 24.5. And VR = ST = 24.5.

But in triangle RSV, which is right-angled at S, with RS = 24, SV = 24.5, and VR = 24.5. Wait, but that would mean that in triangle RSV, RS = 24, SV = 24.5, and VR = 24.5. Using Pythagoras:

RS² + SV² = VR²  
24² + 24.5² = 24.5²  
Which implies 24² = 0, which is false. So this is impossible.

Hmm. Another possibility: maybe the congruence is R→T, S→S, V→V, but this leads to contradictions as before.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the triangles are not right-angled at V in TVS, but at another vertex? Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(T,V,S)) is given, which is at V. So it's definitely right-angled at V.

Wait, but what if the given MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is not x, but another angle? Let me recheck the angle labels.

The question asks for x = MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), which is angle at S between T and V, i.e., angle TSV. But the given also says MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°, which is the same angle. So this suggests that x=78°, but this isn't an option. This implies that either the problem has a typo, or I've made a critical error.

Wait, maybe I confused the correspondence of the angles in the congruent triangles. Let me try to think differently.

Since triangles RSV and TVS are congruent, their angles are equal. In triangle RSV, angles are 90° at S, 78° at V, and 12° at R. In triangle TVS, the angles must be the same. So angle at V is 90°, angle at T is 12°, and angle at S is 78°. So angle at S in triangle TVS is 78°, which is x. But this contradicts the given MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°, which is the same as x. So x=78°, but this isn't an option. This suggests that the problem might have a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Wait, but the answer choices are 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5. These are much smaller numbers. Perhaps the angle x is not the one I think it is. Let me re-examine the angle labels.

The question says: Find x, where Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x). Angle(T,S,V) is the angle at S between T and V. In triangle TVS, this is angle at S. But maybe I'm mixing up the triangles. Let me consider triangle TVS: vertices T, V, S. So the angles are at T, V, S. The given Angle(T,V,S) is the angle at V, which is 90°. The other angles are at T and S. So angle at S is x, and angle at T is 180 - 90 - x.

But in triangle RSV, the angles are at R, S, V: 12°, 90°, 78°. Since the triangles are congruent, angle at T in TVS corresponds to angle at R in RSV, which is 12°. So angle at T in TVS is 12°, and angle at S in TVS is x = 78°, as before.

But again, this leads to x=78°, not in options. So perhaps the given MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is not x, but another angle?

Wait, the user provided the following:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78)".

So Angle(V,S,T) is at S between V and T, which is the same as angle at S in triangle TVS, which is x. So x=78°. But this isn't in the options. So there must be a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, let me revisit the side lengths. We had RS = 24, from TV = 24 (since RS corresponds to TV in congruent triangles). And SV is sqrt(24.25). But what is SV? SV is the length of Line(S,V), which is given as part of the predicates? Let me check the given LengthOf(Line(S,V))? No, the given LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = 2y - 1, LengthOf(Line(S,T)) = 24.5, LengthOf(Line(V,T)) = 24. But what about Line(S,V)? Is there any information about it?

No, the given doesn't specify the length of Line(S,V). But in triangle RSV, which is right-angled at S, with RS = 24 and SV = ? and hypotenuse RV = 24.5. So SV^2 = 24.5^2 - 24^2 = 600.25 - 576 = 24.25, so SV = sqrt(24.25) = 4.924... 

In triangle TVS, which is right-angled at V, with legs TV = 24 and VS = 4.924..., and hypotenuse TS = 24.5. So angle at S is x = arcsin(TV / TS) = arcsin(24 / 24.5) ≈ 78.5°, as before.

But the given says that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) = 78°, which is x. So this suggests that the problem assumes x is 78°, but due to rounding or some other reason, it's considered 78°, even though mathematically it's slightly more. But since the options don't include 78°, this is problematic.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not in the right triangle, but in another configuration. Let me think: could there be another triangle involving x?

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(T,S,V) = x, which is in triangle TVS. But if the triangle is not right-angled, but somehow other. Wait, but we know it is right-angled at V. So this brings us back to the previous calculation.

At this point, I'm stuck. The given data seems to suggest x=78°, but that's not an option. However, the options are 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5. Let me think if there's another angle that could be x. Perhaps I mixed up the angles.

Wait, the question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), which is angle at S in triangle TVS. But what if this angle is not the one I think? Let me visualize the triangles.

Triangle RSV: right-angled at S, with RS and SV as legs, RV as hypotenuse.

Triangle TVS: right-angled at V, with TV and VS as legs, TS as hypotenuse.

So, in triangle TVS, angle at S is between TS and VS. So, this is angle TSV, which is x. To find this angle, in the right triangle, it is opposite to TV (length 24), and adjacent to VS (length sqrt(24.25)). So tan(x) = 24 / sqrt(24.25). Let me calculate this value numerically.

First, calculate sqrt(24.25):

24.25 = 24 + 0.25 = 24 + 1/4 = 97/4. So sqrt(97)/2 ≈ 9.849/2 = 4.9245.

So tan(x) = 24 / 4.9245 ≈ 4.875.

Now, what angle has tangent of 4.875?

As mentioned earlier, tan(78°) ≈ 4.7046, tan(79°) ≈ 5.144. So 4.875 is between 78° and 79°. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Using linear approximation between 78° and 79°:

Let’s denote f(θ) = tan(θ). We know f(78°) ≈ 4.7046, f(79°) ≈ 5.144. Our target is 4.875.

Difference between 4.875 and 4.7046 is 0.1704. Total range from 78° to 79° is 5.144 - 4.7046 = 0.4394.

Fraction = 0.1704 / 0.4394 ≈ 0.388. So angle ≈ 78° + 0.388*(1°) ≈ 78.388°, approximately 78.4°. 

But the given says that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is 78°, which is the same angle. So this suggests that the problem expects x=78°, but since that's not an option, there must be an error. Alternatively, maybe the given MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is not x, but another angle. Let me recheck.

The given includes:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78) → angle at V in RSV is 78°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,V,S)), 90) → angle at V in TVS is 90°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,V)), x) → angle at S in TVS is x.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)), 78) → angle at S in TVS is 78°.

So this implies x=78°, but it's not in the options. This suggests that either there is a mistake in the problem, or I've misunderstood the angle labeling.

Wait, perhaps the angle labeled as Angle(V,S,T) is not the same as Angle(T,S,V)? Let me recheck:

Angle(V,S,T) is the angle at S between V and T → same as angle at S in triangle TVS, which is x. Angle(T,S,V) is the angle at S between T and V → same thing. So they are the same. Hence, x=78°, but not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant to say that MeasureOf(Angle(V,S,T)) is 78°, but it's actually a different angle. Or perhaps the given is incorrect. Without further information, it's hard to proceed.

But since the options are limited, and the closest possible value to 78.4° is not present, perhaps there's a miscalculation in assuming the correspondence of the triangles. Let me try a different approach using the given side lengths.

We have:

- In triangle RSV, right-angled at S, with RS = 24, SV = sqrt(24.25
