Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of JH given some other lengths and conditions. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given information.

First, all the points are connected in a series of vertical and horizontal lines. The problem mentions several vertical lines: HJ, JK, KL, LM. These are all vertical because they're stated as IsVertical for each. Then there are horizontal lines: SR, RQ, QP, PM. Also, each vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line, like HJ is perpendicular to SR, JK to RQ, etc. 

Looking at the angles mentioned, each angle at J, K, L, and M is a right angle. So, the structure seems to form a sort of grid or maybe multiple rectangles or squares connected together. 

Let me note down the given lengths:

- Length of LK is 4 (so from point L to K is 4 units).
- Length of MP is 3 (from M to P is 3).
- PQ is 6 (from P to Q is 6).
- KJ is 2 (from K to J is 2).
- RS is 6 (from R to S is 6).
- LP is 2 (from L to P is 2).

We need to find JH. Since HJ is a vertical line segment, and J is part of the vertical line HJ, which is vertical. So JH would be the same as the length of HJ.

Now, let's think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point can help. Let me assume coordinate system where some points have known positions.

Since all vertical lines are vertical, and horizontal lines are horizontal. Let me consider that the vertical lines HJ, JK, KL, LM are all aligned vertically. Similarly, the horizontal lines SR, RQ, QP, PM are horizontal. Also, each vertical line is connected perpendicularly to a horizontal line. For example, HJ is vertical, and it's perpendicular to SR (which is horizontal). So, if I assign coordinates, perhaps starting from point J?

Wait, but since all vertical lines are vertical, and horizontal lines are horizontal, maybe these form a grid. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Starting with point J. Since HJ is vertical, and JK is also vertical. Wait, no—each vertical line is HJ, then JK, KL, LM. Wait, that suggests that each consecutive vertical line starts at the previous point. Like HJ is vertical, so H is above J? Or maybe J is between H and K? Wait, the lines are Line(H,J), Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(L,M). So, each subsequent line connects to the next point. So, H-J-K-L-M are connected in a straight vertical line? Because each line is vertical. Wait, but if each line is vertical, then H-J-K-L-M are colinear vertically. But then how does that fit with the horizontal lines?

Alternatively, maybe each vertical line is separate. Wait, no. Because Line(H,J) is vertical. Then Line(J,K) is vertical. That would mean that J is connected to K via a vertical line, implying that J and K are on the same vertical line. But then H is connected to J via vertical line. So H, J, K, L, M are all on the same vertical line? But then the horizontal lines would connect different points. For example, Line(S,R), Line(R,Q), Line(Q,P), Line(P,M) are horizontal. So, for instance, S-R-Q-P-M are on a horizontal line? Wait, but P is connected to M via horizontal line PM. So, if P is on the horizontal line with Q and R and S? Not sure yet.

But given that each vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line. For example, Line(HJ) is perpendicular to Line(SR). Since HJ is vertical, then SR must be horizontal. Which matches the given condition that SR is horizontal.

So, the entire structure might be a combination of vertical and horizontal segments forming rectangles or something similar.

Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

Start with point J. Let's assume J has coordinates (x, y). Since HJ is vertical, then H is directly above or below J. Let's say H is above J. Then, since Line(HJ) is vertical, moving up from J to H.

Similarly, Line(J,K) is vertical, meaning K is either above or below J. But since the lines are HJ, JK, KL, LM—all vertical. So, if HJ is vertical, then J is connected to K via another vertical line. Therefore, H, J, K, L, M are all along the same vertical line. So, H is above J, then K is below J? Or maybe in sequence? Wait, the order is H-J-K-L-M. So, H connected to J, then J to K, K to L, L to M. All vertical lines. So, H, J, K, L, M are colinear vertically. So, their x-coordinates are the same. Let's denote their x-coordinate as x0.

Then, for the horizontal lines: Line(S,R), Line(R,Q), Line(Q,P), Line(P,M). These are horizontal. So, points S, R, Q, P, M lie on the same horizontal line? Wait, Line(S,R) is horizontal, so S and R have the same y-coordinate. Then Line(R,Q) is horizontal, so R and Q share same y-coordinate. Thus, S, R, Q, P, M are all on the same horizontal line. So, their y-coordinates are same. Let's call this y-coordinate y0.

Also, each vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line. So, for example, Line(HJ) is vertical and perpendicular to Line(SR), which is horizontal. So, the vertical line HJ intersects the horizontal line SR at some point. Given that, perhaps the intersection point is J? Or maybe another point? Wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(H,J), Line(S,R)). So, the two lines are perpendicular. Since HJ is vertical and SR is horizontal, they are already perpendicular regardless of position. But where do they intersect?

Possibly, the lines HJ and SR intersect at point J? Or maybe at another point? Wait, but Line(S,R) is horizontal, and Line(H,J) is vertical. So, unless they cross at a common point. Let me think.

Suppose that point J is connected to S via some connection? Not necessarily. However, given that there are right angles at each of the points J, K, L, M. For example, Angle(H,J,S) is a right angle. So, at point J, the lines HJ and JS form a right angle. Wait, but HJ is vertical, so JS would need to be horizontal. Therefore, JS is horizontal. But according to the given data, Line(S,R) is horizontal. So, if JS is horizontal, then S lies on the horizontal line passing through J. Wait, but earlier we thought that S, R, Q, P, M are on the same horizontal line. So, if JS is horizontal, then S is on that line. So, the horizontal line through J is the same as the horizontal line through S, R, Q, P, M. Hence, the horizontal line passes through J and S.

Therefore, the horizontal line containing S, R, Q, P, M also passes through J. Therefore, point J is on that horizontal line. Therefore, the horizontal line goes through J and extends to S, R, Q, P, M. 

So, putting this together, the vertical line HJ-K-L-M is vertical, and the horizontal line through J-S-R-Q-P-M is horizontal. Therefore, the point J is the intersection of the vertical line HJ-K-L-M and the horizontal line J-S-R-Q-P-M. 

This suggests that the horizontal line passes through J, and the vertical line passes through J. So, J is the corner where the vertical and horizontal lines meet. 

Now, considering the given lengths. Let me try to assign coordinates. Let me set coordinates such that point J is at origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since the vertical line HJ is upwards, H would be at (0, h) for some h. Then, since Line(J,K) is vertical, K would be along the same vertical line. Since KJ is given as 2 units. Since J is at (0,0), and K is on the vertical line, then K could be at (0, -2) if downward direction, or (0, 2) upward. But need to check consistency with other points.

But wait, looking at the right angles. At point J, the angle HJS is a right angle. So, HJ is vertical, JS is horizontal. Therefore, from J, going up/down along HJ, and to the left/right along JS. Since the horizontal line is J-S-R-Q-P-M, so S is to the right or left of J. Let's assume S is to the right of J, so positive x-direction.

Thus, if J is at (0,0), then S is somewhere along the horizontal line. Let's say S is at (s, 0). Then, since Line(S,R) is horizontal, R is at (s + r, 0), etc., but need to use given lengths.

Additionally, we know that Line(R,Q) is horizontal, so Q is at (s + r + q, 0)? Wait, but the horizontal line is S-R-Q-P-M. So, the distance between S and R is given as RS=6. So, the length of Line(S,R) is 6. So, if S is at (a, 0), then R is at (a + 6, 0). Then, Line(R,Q) is horizontal, so Q is at (a + 6 + b, 0), etc. But we also have PQ=6. Wait, the length of Line(P,Q) is 6. So, PQ is horizontal, so the distance between P and Q is 6. Similarly, PM is horizontal, so distance between P and M is 3 (given MP=3). Wait, the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,P)), 3). So, MP is 3. So, from M to P is 3 units horizontally.

But also, there's the line LP=2. The length of Line(L,P) is 2. So, L to P is 2 units. Now, need to relate all these.

But first, let's get back to coordinates. Let me fix J at (0,0). Since HJ is vertical, and assuming upwards direction, H is at (0, h), and since Line(J,K) is vertical, K is at (0, k). But need to find relations between these points.

But also, the horizontal line through J is JS, so S is at (s, 0). Then, the horizontal line continues to R, Q, P, M. Let me define variables for these positions.

Let me suppose that the horizontal line is the x-axis. So, J is at (0,0), S is at (s, 0), R is at (s + 6, 0) since RS=6. Then Q is at (s + 6 + x, 0), P is at (s + 6 + x + y, 0), and M is at (s + 6 + x + y + z, 0). But also, PM is given as 3 units. So, the distance between P and M is 3. So, |z| = 3. Assuming direction, but need to see.

Additionally, there's the line LP with length 2. L is a point on the vertical line HJ-K-L-M. Since the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M. So, starting from H, then J, then K, then L, then M. So, each of these points is along the same vertical line. So, their x-coordinate is the same as J, which is 0. So, H is at (0, h), J at (0, 0), K at (0, k), L at (0, l), M at (0, m). But since Line(J,K) is vertical, K is either above or below J. Let me think about directions. If the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M, then depending on the direction of the lines. Suppose that H is above J, then J is between H and K. Wait, but the lines are H-J, J-K, etc. So, H is connected to J, then J to K. If the vertical line is upwards, then H is above J, and K is below J? No, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, the vertical line is continuous. So, H-J-K-L-M are all on the same vertical line. So, H is connected to J, then J to K, so if they are all vertical, then H, J, K, L, M are stacked vertically. So, for example, H is higher than J, then J is higher than K, etc., or vice versa. But without knowing the direction, maybe we can assign coordinates accordingly.

But let's take J at (0,0). Then, since Line(J,K) is vertical, K is along the same vertical line. Let's suppose that K is below J. So, K is at (0, -k) for some k. Given that KJ is 2 units. So, the length between J(0,0) and K(0,-k) is k. So, k=2. So, K is at (0, -2). Then, Line(K,L) is vertical, so L is further down. Let's say L is at (0, -2 - d), and so on. But we also have the length of LK is 4. LK is the distance between L and K. Since both are on vertical line, it's just the difference in y-coordinates. So, if K is at (0, -2), and L is at (0, -2 -d), then the distance LK is d. Given that equals 4, so d=4. So, L is at (0, -2 -4) = (0, -6).

Then, Line(L,M) is vertical. So, M is at (0, -6 - e). And the length of Line(M,P) is 3. Wait, but P is on the horizontal line. Wait, PM is a horizontal line. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,P)), 3). So, the length between M and P is 3. But M is on the vertical line (since M is part of the vertical line H-J-K-L-M), while P is on the horizontal line. So, the distance between M and P is horizontal? No, because M is on vertical line, and P is on horizontal line. Unless they are connected by a horizontal line. Wait, the line PM is horizontal. So, PM is horizontal, meaning that P and M are on the same horizontal line. Wait, no—the line PM is horizontal, so the line connecting P and M is horizontal. Therefore, P and M have the same y-coordinate. But M is on the vertical line (same x-coordinate as others). So, M is at (0, y_m), and P is at (p_x, y_m). So, the horizontal line PM has length equal to |p_x - 0| = |p_x|. Since the length is 3, so p_x = ±3. Depending on direction.

But also, the length of LP is 2. LP is the distance between L and P. Since L is at (0, -6), and P is at (p_x, y_m). The distance between them is sqrt[(p_x - 0)^2 + (y_m - (-6))^2] = sqrt(p_x² + (y_m +6)^2) = 2. So, that equation must hold.

Additionally, we have the horizontal line passing through P and M. Earlier, we said that the horizontal line includes points S, R, Q, P, M. So, the y-coordinate for all these points is the same. Let's denote this as y_h. Since M is on the horizontal line PM, its y-coordinate is y_h. Also, since M is on the vertical line, its coordinates are (0, y_m). Therefore, y_m = y_h. So, the y-coordinate of M is y_h, and hence the y-coordinate of P is also y_h. Therefore, P is at (p_x, y_h), and M is at (0, y_h). 

So, the distance between P and M is |p_x - 0| = 3. So, p_x = 3 or -3. Let's assume it's positive, so P is at (3, y_h). Then, the distance between L(0, -6) and P(3, y_h) is sqrt((3-0)^2 + (y_h - (-6))^2) = sqrt(9 + (y_h +6)^2) = 2. Therefore:

sqrt(9 + (y_h +6)^2) = 2 → square both sides:

9 + (y_h +6)^2 = 4 → (y_h +6)^2 = -5. Which is impossible. Therefore, contradiction. So, my assumption about the direction of the vertical line may be wrong. 

Alternative possibility: Maybe the horizontal line is not the same as the y-coordinate of M. Wait, but PM is a horizontal line. So, if M is on the vertical line, and P is on the horizontal line, then their y-coordinates must match. So, M's y-coordinate is same as P's. But earlier calculation led to inconsistency. So, what went wrong here?

Maybe my assumption about the direction of the vertical line. Perhaps the vertical line is going downwards instead of upwards. Let me re-examine the setup.

Let me try again. Assume that the vertical line H-J-K-L-M goes downward. So, H is above J, then J is above K, then K is above L, then L is above M. Wait, but that would require that the line H-J is upwards, then J-K is downward? No, because Line(J,K) is vertical. So, if J is connected to K via a vertical line, then K could be above or below J. If we had H-J-K-L-M as a vertical line, then the order implies that each subsequent point is in the same vertical line. So, H is the topmost, then J, then K, then L, then M at the bottom. So, H is above J, K is below J, L is below K, M is below L. Wait, but then the line J-K would go from J down to K. So, the length KJ is 2 units. So, if J is at (0,0), then K is at (0, -2). Then, L is further down, say (0, -2 -4) = (0, -6) because LK is 4. Then, M is further down, so (0, -6 -e), and PM is horizontal. 

Now, P is on the horizontal line that includes S, R, Q, P, M. So, P is at (p_x, y_p), and M is at (0, y_m). Since PM is horizontal, their y-coordinates must match. Therefore, y_p = y_m. So, M is at (0, y_m), and P is at (p_x, y_m). The length PM is 3, so |p_x - 0| = 3 → p_x = 3 or -3. Let's take p_x = 3. So, P is at (3, y_m). 

Then, the distance between L(0, -6) and P(3, y_m) is 2. So:

√[(3)^2 + (y_m - (-6))²] = √[9 + (y_m +6)^2] = 2 → squaring gives 9 + (y_m +6)^2 = 4 → (y_m +6)^2 = -5 → still impossible. Same issue. 

Hmm. This suggests an error in assumptions. Maybe the horizontal line isn't the same as the y-coordinate of M. Wait, but PM is a horizontal line. So, if M is on the vertical line at (0, y_m), then P must be at (something, y_m). So, same y-coordinate. So, the previous reasoning holds. But why the negative result?

Perhaps the mistake is in the assignment of coordinates for L. Let me check the given lengths again. We have LK = 4. So, distance between L and K is 4. If K is at (0, -2), then L is 4 units away from K along the vertical line. So, if the vertical line is going downward, then L would be at (0, -2 -4) = (0, -6). Correct. 

Another possibility: Maybe the horizontal line isn't the same as the y-coordinate of M. But PM is horizontal, so P and M must share same y-coordinate. Alternatively, maybe the horizontal line is not the same as the one through J. Wait, earlier we considered that the horizontal line through J is the same as the one through S, R, Q, P, M. But what if it's different? Let me think again.

At point J, there is a right angle between HJ and JS. So, JS is horizontal. So, JS is part of the horizontal line that includes S, R, Q, P, M. Therefore, the horizontal line through J is the same as the one through S, R, Q, P, M. Therefore, P and M are on that same horizontal line. Thus, their y-coordinate is same as J's y-coordinate, which is zero. Wait! Because J is on that horizontal line. So, if J is at (0,0), then the horizontal line through J is y=0. Therefore, points S, R, Q, P, M are on y=0. Therefore, M has y-coordinate 0. So, M is at (0, 0)? No, because M is on the vertical line. Wait, no. The vertical line is H-J-K-L-M. So, M is on that vertical line. So, M has x-coordinate same as others, which is 0. So, M is at (0, y_m). But since M is on the horizontal line through J (y=0), then y_m = 0. So, M is at (0, 0). But J is also at (0,0). That would imply M coincides with J? Which is not possible. Contradiction again.

Wait, that suggests that my initial assumption that J is on the horizontal line is incorrect. But according to the right angle at J, the lines HJ and JS are perpendicular. Since HJ is vertical, JS must be horizontal. Therefore, JS is horizontal, so S is on the horizontal line through J. Therefore, the horizontal line through J includes S, R, Q, P, M. Therefore, those points are on the same horizontal line as J. So, if J is at (0,0), then all those points are on y=0. So, M is on the horizontal line, so M's y-coordinate is 0. But M is on the vertical line, so M's x-coordinate is same as others (like J). Therefore, M is at (0,0). But then, since M is on the vertical line H-J-K-L-M, and J is also at (0,0), then M is the same as J? Which can't be. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Ah! Here's the key mistake: The vertical line is H-J-K-L-M, and the horizontal line is S-R-Q-P-M. So, the point M is shared between both lines. Therefore, M is the intersection point of the vertical line and the horizontal line. Therefore, M is at the same location as the endpoint of the horizontal line. So, for example, if the horizontal line is from S to M, then M is the end of the horizontal line. Therefore, M is at (some x, y) and also on the vertical line. So, the vertical line contains M. So, M is at (x_m, y_m), and since it's on the vertical line, its x-coordinate is same as others (like J, K, L, H). So, if J is at (0,0), then the vertical line has x=0. Therefore, M is at (0, y_m). But M is also on the horizontal line, which means its y-coordinate is same as S, R, Q, P. So, if the horizontal line is through J, then y_m is 0. Therefore, M is at (0,0). Which is same as J. Again contradiction. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the configuration. Perhaps the horizontal line doesn't pass through J? But how? At point J, the angle HJS is a right angle, so HJ and JS are perpendicular. Since HJ is vertical, JS must be horizontal. Therefore, JS is horizontal, so S is on the horizontal line passing through J. Thus, the horizontal line includes J and S, and therefore also includes R, Q, P, M. Hence, M is on that horizontal line. So, M is on both the vertical line and the horizontal line. Therefore, M is the intersection point of the vertical and horizontal lines. So, M is at the same position as J? No, because J is on the vertical line. Wait, the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M. So, M is the last point on the vertical line. If M is also on the horizontal line, then the horizontal line passes through M. So, the horizontal line passes through M and extends to S, R, Q, P. So, for example, the horizontal line goes from S to P to M. So, M is the end of the horizontal line. 

Let me redefine coordinates with this in mind. Let me place M at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since M is on the horizontal line, the horizontal line passes through M. So, the horizontal line is along the x-axis (assuming y=0). Then, the vertical line containing M is the line x=0. So, points H, J, K, L, M are on x=0. So, M is at (0,0). Then, the vertical line goes upward from M to L, K, J, H. Wait, but the order is H-J-K-L-M. So, if M is at (0,0), then L is above M, K is above L, J is above K, H is above J. So, the vertical line goes upward from M through L, K, J, H. 

So, M is at (0,0). Let's compute coordinates step by step.

First, the length of Line(L,P) is 2. P is on the horizontal line (the x-axis), so P is at (p, 0). The distance between L and P is 2. 

What is the position of L? Since LK = 4. K is connected to L via vertical line. Let's work backwards. Starting from M at (0,0). Line(L,M) is vertical. So, L is directly above M. Let's say L is at (0, y_L). Then, the distance between L and M is |y_L - 0| = |y_L| = ? Well, the length of Line(L,M) is not given directly. Wait, the given lengths are:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,K)), 4): LK = 4.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,P)), 3): MP = 3.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(P,Q)), 6): PQ = 6.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,J)), 2): KJ = 2.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), 6): RS = 6.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,P)), 2): LP = 2.

So, let's start with M at (0,0). 

Line(L,M) is vertical. So, L is at (0, y_L). Then, Line(L,K) is vertical, so K is at (0, y_K). The length LK is |y_K - y_L| = 4. 

Also, Line(K,J) is vertical, so J is at (0, y_J), with |y_J - y_K| = 2 (since KJ = 2).

Then, Line(J,H) is vertical, so H is at (0, y_H), with |y_H - y_J| being whatever.

Now, the horizontal line through P and M is the x-axis (since M is at (0,0)). So, P is at (p, 0). The length of Line(M,P) is 3, so |p - 0| = 3 → p = 3 or -3. Let's assume p = 3 for simplicity, so P is at (3, 0). 

Then, the length of Line(L,P) is 2. L is at (0, y_L), so the distance between (0, y_L) and (3, 0) is sqrt((3-0)^2 + (0 - y_L)^2) = sqrt(9 + y_L^2) = 2. Squaring both sides: 9 + y_L^2 = 4 → y_L^2 = -5. Impossible again. So, same problem. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. Perhaps the horizontal line is not the x-axis? Or maybe the vertical line is not aligned with the y-axis? Wait, but we assumed that the vertical line is x=0, and the horizontal line is y=0. Maybe the horizontal line is not passing through M? But earlier logic suggested it should.

Wait, let's think differently. Since the horizontal line contains P and M, and PM = 3. So, if M is at (0, y_m), then P is at (3, y_m) or (-3, y_m). The distance between L and P is 2. L is on the vertical line, so its coordinates are (0, y_L). So, the distance between (0, y_L) and (3, y_m) is sqrt(9 + (y_m - y_L)^2) = 2. So, 9 + (y_m - y_L)^2 = 4 → (y_m - y_L)^2 = -5. Still impossible. 

This implies that there is no solution under these assumptions, which can't be true. Therefore, there must be a mistake in how I'm interpreting the diagram. Let me revisit the problem statement.

Rechecking the problem: 

- Lines HJ, JK, KL, LM are vertical.
- Lines SR, RQ, QP, PM are horizontal.
- Angles at J, K, L, M are right angles.
- RightAngle(Angle(H,J,S)): At J, between HJ and JS, right angle.
- So, HJ is vertical, JS is horizontal.
- So, JS is part of the horizontal line. So, S is on the horizontal line passing through J. 
- But also, the horizontal lines are SR, RQ, QP, PM. So, the horizontal line through J is the same as the horizontal line through S, R, Q, P, M. Hence, J is on this horizontal line. 

So, J is on both the vertical line (H-J-K-L-M) and the horizontal line (through S-R-Q-P-M). Therefore, J is the intersection point of the vertical and horizontal lines. Hence, J is at (x_j, y_j), and the vertical line has x=x_j, and the horizontal line has y=y_j. 

Let me assign coordinates with J at (a, b). Then, the vertical line H-J-K-L-M is x=a. The horizontal line through J is y=b, containing S, R, Q, P, M. 

So, M is on both the vertical line and the horizontal line. Hence, M is at (a, b). But wait, since M is on the vertical line, which is x=a, and on the horizontal line, which is y=b. So, M is at (a, b). But J is also at (a, b). So, M and J are the same point? No, because the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M, so M is after L, which is after K, etc. So, M cannot be the same as J. 

This indicates that the horizontal line passes through J and extends beyond to include S, R, Q, P, M. So, M is on the horizontal line, but not at J. So, M is at (a, b), but since it's on the horizontal line, its y-coordinate is b. And since it's on the vertical line, its x-coordinate is a. Hence, M is at (a, b). But J is also on the horizontal line, so J is at (c, b), but also on the vertical line, so c=a. Hence, J is at (a, b), and M is at (a, b). Contradiction again. 

Wait, unless the horizontal line is not the same as the one through J. But how? The angle at J involves the horizontal line. 

Maybe the horizontal line through J is different from the ones through S, R, Q, P, M? No, because Line(S,R), Line(R,Q), Line(Q,P), Line(P,M) are all horizontal. So, they must all be on the same horizontal line. And since the angle at J involves JS being horizontal, which is part of that same horizontal line. Hence, all those points are on the same horizontal line. 

This is very confusing. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that the horizontal line passes through J. Let me think again about the angle at J. 

The angle at J is Angle(H,J,S), which is a right angle. This means that the lines HJ and JS form a right angle. Since HJ is vertical, JS must be horizontal. Therefore, JS is horizontal, so S is on the horizontal line through J. Hence, the horizontal line through J is the same as the one through S, R, Q, P, M. Hence, M is on that horizontal line. 

So, if J is on the vertical line (H-J-K-L-M) and on the horizontal line (S-R-Q-P-M), then the intersection of these two lines is J and M? No, because the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M, and the horizontal line is S-R-Q-P-M. So, M is the end of both lines. So, M is the point where the vertical line meets the horizontal line. Hence, M is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. Therefore, J is on the vertical line, but not necessarily on the horizontal line. Wait, but the angle at J requires JS to be horizontal, so J must be on the horizontal line. 

This is the crux of the problem. There's a contradiction unless J and M are the same point, which they aren't. 

Wait, maybe the horizontal line passes through J and extends to S, R, Q, P, and ends at M. So, J is not the endpoint of the horizontal line. For example, the horizontal line starts at S, goes through R, Q, P, and ends at M. J is somewhere on this line. 

For example, imagine the horizontal line as S---R---Q---P---M, and J is somewhere on this line, not necessarily at the endpoints. Then, the vertical line H-J-K-L-M goes from H down to J, then continues to K, L, M. So, J is on the horizontal line, and M is the end of both the horizontal and vertical lines. 

In this case, J is at some point on the horizontal line, and M is at the end of the horizontal line. 

Let me try this approach. Let me define the horizontal line as S-R-Q-P-M, with M at the end. J is somewhere on this line. Let me assign coordinates. Let me set M at (0,0) as before. The horizontal line is from S to M, so S is at (-s, 0), R at (-s + r, 0), Q at (-s + r + q, 0), P at (-s + r + q + p, 0), and M at (0,0). 

Then, J is somewhere on this horizontal line. Let's say J is at (j, 0), where j is between S and M. 

Now, the vertical line H-J-K-L-M goes from H down to J, then to K, L, and finally to M. Since M is at (0,0), and J is at (j, 0), then the vertical line passes through J and M. Wait, no. If the vertical line is H-J-K-L-M
