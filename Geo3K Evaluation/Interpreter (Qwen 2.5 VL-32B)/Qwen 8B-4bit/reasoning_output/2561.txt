MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, and E. The Rectangle(A, B, C, D) means that ABCD is a rectangle. So, AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the rectangle, and all angles are right angles. Also, there are lines connecting these points: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). Additionally, there's a point E connected via lines to A, B, and D. Specifically, Line(A,E), Line(B,E), and Line(E,D). 

Now, some angle predicates: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,A,E)). These indicate that angles at B and A involving point E are right angles. Also, Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) confirms that triangle ABE is a right triangle. 

There are also length equalities: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 5), so AB = 5 units. Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), 6), so BE = 6. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 4), so AE = 4. 

Moreover, Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(D,E)) and Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(B,E)). This suggests that sides AB and DE are parallel, and AD and BE are parallel. Since AB is part of the rectangle, DE being parallel to AB would mean DE is either horizontal or vertical depending on the rectangle's orientation. Similarly, AD and BE being parallel implies that AD is parallel to BE, which could affect the shape of the figure.

The question asks for the area of the figure. Wait, but what figure? The problem mentions a rectangle ABCD and a triangle ABE. However, there's also point E connected to D, forming another line ED. But since the rectangle is ABCD, adding point E creates a new figure. Maybe the entire figure includes both the rectangle and the triangle?

But wait, looking back at the AreaOf predicates: AreaOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D)) and AreaOf(Triangle(A,B,E)). So the problem is asking for the area of the figure formed by combining these elements? Or perhaps the total area including both the rectangle and the triangle? Hmm, but maybe the figure refers to the union of the rectangle and triangle? Or maybe it's referring to the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle? Alternatively, since E is connected to D, maybe there's another shape involved?

Wait, let me think again. The problem says "the area of the figure". The figure is likely composed of the rectangle ABCD and the triangle ABE. But we need to check if there's overlapping or something else. Alternatively, since E is connected to D, maybe the figure includes the rectangle and the triangle, but we need to calculate the total area without double-counting.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is the combination of the rectangle and the triangle, but given that E is inside the rectangle? Let me try to visualize.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, and E is connected to A, B, and D. Given that Line(A,B) is one side of the rectangle, and Line(B,E) is another line. Also, Line(A,E) connects A to E, and Line(E,D) connects E to D. Also, the lines AB || DE and AD || BE. Because of the parallelism, this suggests that the lines AB and DE are parallel, so DE is parallel to AB, which is a side of the rectangle. Similarly, AD is parallel to BE. Since AD is a side of the rectangle, BE is parallel to AD.

Let me sketch mentally: Rectangle ABCD with AB=5, BC=?, CD=AB=5, DA=BC. Now, point E is such that BE=6, AE=4, and ED is connected. Also, angles at A and B involving E are right angles. So, Triangle ABE is a right triangle with legs AB=5 and AE=4? Wait, but according to the given data, LengthOf(AE)=4, LengthOf(BE)=6. But if angle at A is a right angle, then AE and AB would be perpendicular. Wait, Angle(A,B,E) is a right angle. That means that at point B, the angle between BA and BE is 90 degrees. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E)) indicates that the angle at point B is between points A, B, E. So angle at B between BA and BE is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(B,A,E)) means the angle at point A between points B, A, E is a right angle. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify.

The first predicate: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E)) means that angle at B between points A, B, E is a right angle. So vectors BA and BE form a right angle at B. The second predicate: RightAngle(Angle(B,A,E)) means angle at A between points B, A, E is a right angle. So vectors AB and AE form a right angle at A. Therefore, triangle ABE has two right angles at A and B, making it a right triangle with right angles at both A and B. Wait, but a triangle can't have two right angles unless it's degenerate. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless... Wait, maybe I misread the angle notation.

Wait, the angle notation is written as Angle(X,Y,Z), which represents the angle at Y between points X-Y-Z. So Angle(A,B,E) is the angle at point B between points A, B, E. Similarly, Angle(B,A,E) is the angle at point A between points B, A, E. So, if both those angles are right angles, then at point B, angle between BA and BE is 90°, and at point A, angle between BA and AE is 90°. Wait, but BA is the same as AB. So if both angles at A and B are right angles, then triangle ABE would have two right angles, which isn't possible unless it's a degenerate triangle. That suggests there's a mistake here, or perhaps my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, maybe the second angle is Angle(B,A,E), which is the angle at A between B-A-E. So that would imply that at point A, the angle between AB and AE is 90°, and at point B, the angle between BA and BE is 90°. Therefore, triangle ABE has a right angle at A and a right angle at B. Which would mean that the third angle at E is 0°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at B is between BA and BE, and the angle at A is between EA and AB. Wait, but that still would require triangle ABE to have two right angles. This contradiction suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Given that Right(Triangle(A,B,E)), which states that triangle ABE is a right triangle. So the triangle must have one right angle. The two right angles mentioned in the predicates may refer to different angles, but they can't both be in the same triangle. So perhaps one of them is incorrect? Or maybe the way the angles are defined is different.

Wait, maybe the angle at B is between points A-B-E, which is a right angle, and the angle at A is between points B-A-E, which is also a right angle. But that would mean that in triangle ABE, both angles at A and B are right angles, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or my interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at A is between points E-A-B, not B-A-E. Wait, the notation Angle(B,A,E) is the angle at A between B and E. So the vertex is A, with segments AB and AE. So if that angle is a right angle, then AB is perpendicular to AE. Similarly, Angle(A,B,E) is the angle at B between A and E, so BA is perpendicular to BE. Thus, triangle ABE has two right angles at A and B, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. How is this possible?

Wait, maybe the triangle is not ABE, but another triangle? Wait, the Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) says it's triangle ABE. So this suggests that there's an inconsistency. Unless one of the right angles is not in the triangle. Wait, but the angle at B is between BA and BE, which are two sides of the triangle. Similarly, the angle at A is between AB and AE, which are also two sides. So both angles are in the triangle. Hence, triangle ABE cannot have two right angles. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the given data again. It says:

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E)) → angle at B between A-B-E is right.

RightAngle(Angle(B,A,E)) → angle at A between B-A-E is right.

So both angles at A and B are right angles. Therefore, triangle ABE would have two right angles, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation here. But the problem gives us that Right(Triangle(A,B,E)), implying that triangle ABE is a right triangle. So where's the error?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the angle at E is the right angle. But the given predicates say the angles at A and B are right angles. That's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps the angles are not both in triangle ABE. Wait, but the angle at A is between BA and AE, which are two sides of the triangle. Similarly, the angle at B is between BA and BE, which are also two sides. Therefore, both angles are in the triangle, leading to a contradiction.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. However, since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the angle at A is between EA and AB, and the angle at B is between EB and BA, which are adjacent sides. So, even though both are right angles, they are at different vertices. But in a triangle, only one right angle is allowed. Therefore, this scenario is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake. But since the problem includes these predicates, perhaps I need to proceed despite the apparent contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not ABE, but another triangle. Wait, the Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) is explicitly stated. So I need to reconcile this. Perhaps the problem involves more than just triangle ABE. For example, maybe the triangle is not ABE but another triangle, but the name is given incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at E. Let me consider that possibility.

Suppose that the right angle is at E. Then, the angle at E would be 90°, and the other angles at A and B would sum to 90°. But the given predicates state that angles at A and B are right angles. So this is inconsistent. Therefore, this problem seems contradictory. However, given that the problem is presented, I must assume that there's a valid configuration. Therefore, I must find a way to resolve this.

Wait, perhaps the triangle ABE is not a right triangle, but the problem states it is. Therefore, there's a conflict. Let me check the given lengths. They give AB = 5, BE = 6, AE = 4. Let's compute the Pythagorean theorem. If triangle ABE were a right triangle, then the sum of squares of two sides should equal the square of the third. Let's see:

If the right angle is at A, then AB² + AE² = BE². Compute AB² + AE² = 5² + 4² = 25 + 16 = 41. BE² is 6² = 36. Not equal. So that's not matching. If the right angle is at B, then AB² + BE² = AE². 25 + 36 = 61 vs 16. No. If the right angle is at E, then AE² + BE² = AB². 16 + 36 = 52 vs 25. Still not matching. So none of the possibilities fit. Therefore, the triangle ABE with sides 5, 6, 4 is not a right triangle, contradicting the given Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) predicate. This is confusing.

But the problem says that the Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) is true. Therefore, there must be an error in the given data, or perhaps I misinterpreted the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the lengths are not directly the sides of the triangle. Wait, the lengths given are for Line(A,B) = 5, Line(B,E) = 6, and Line(A,E) = 4. So those are the lengths of the sides of triangle ABE. But according to the Pythagorean theorem, those lengths do not satisfy the condition for a right triangle. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. However, since the problem includes this, I need to proceed. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming it's correct, I have to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABE is not a right triangle, but the problem says it is. This is perplexing. Perhaps the given lengths are not the actual lengths of the triangle's sides. Wait, but the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 5), so AB is 5, BE is 6, and AE is 4. So the triangle ABE has sides of 5, 6, and 4, which don't form a right triangle. Therefore, there's a contradiction. However, the problem says it's a right triangle, so maybe there's an error in the problem's data. But since this is a test question, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the given data is correct and that the triangle is indeed a right triangle, possibly due to some other configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not at A or B, but somewhere else. Wait, but the RightAngle predicates specify angles at A and B. This is very confusing. Perhaps the problem uses non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely. Or perhaps the triangle is degenerate. But that would mean the three points are colinear, which contradicts the existence of a triangle.

At this point, I need to focus on the rest of the information to see if there's another way to approach the problem. Let's look at the parallel lines. Line(A,B) is parallel to Line(D,E), and Line(A,D) is parallel to Line(B,E). Since AB is a side of the rectangle, and AD is another side. In a rectangle, AB and AD are perpendicular. Therefore, if Line(A,D) is parallel to Line(B,E), then Line(B,E) must also be perpendicular to AB. Wait, because AD is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, Line(B,E) is parallel to AD, which is perpendicular to AB, so Line(B,E) is perpendicular to AB. Hence, Line(B,E) is perpendicular to AB, making it vertical if AB is horizontal. Similarly, Line(A,B) is parallel to Line(D,E), so Line(D,E) is parallel to AB, hence also horizontal if AB is horizontal.

Therefore, considering the rectangle ABCD, with AB=5, AD=BC (since it's a rectangle). Now, point E is such that BE=6 and AE=4, and BE is perpendicular to AB (since Line(B,E) is parallel to AD, which is perpendicular to AB). Therefore, BE is perpendicular to AB, making triangle ABE a right triangle at B. Wait, but earlier calculations showed that with AB=5, BE=6, AE=4, this doesn't satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. However, if it's a right triangle at B, then AB² + BE² should equal AE². Wait, no—if the right angle is at B, then AB² + BE² = AE². Let's plug in the numbers: 5² + 6² = 25 + 36 = 61. AE is 4, so 4² = 16. Not equal. So this still doesn't add up. There's a contradiction here.

But the problem states that Right(Triangle(A,B,E)) is true. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's data, or perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check once again. If AB=5, BE=6, and AE=4, then the triangle sides are 5, 6, 4. Let's use the Law of Cosines to find the angles. For example, using Law of Cosines on angle at B:

AE² = AB² + BE² - 2*AB*BE*cos(angle at B)

Which gives:

4² = 5² + 6² - 2*5*6*cos(theta)

16 = 25 + 36 - 60 cos(theta)

16 = 61 - 60 cos(theta)

Rearranged:

60 cos(theta) = 61 - 16 = 45

cos(theta) = 45 / 60 = 0.75

theta ≈ arccos(0.75) ≈ 41.4°, which is not 90°, confirming it's not a right triangle. Hence, the problem's assertion that Triangle ABE is right is incorrect based on the given lengths. This suggests that there's an error in the problem. However, since the problem is given, I must proceed.

Assuming that the problem is correct, perhaps the lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else. Or perhaps the coordinates of the points are arranged differently. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to see if I can make sense of it.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Since AB is a side of the rectangle, let's assume AB is along the x-axis. So point B would be at (5,0), since AB=5. Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, point D would be at (0, y), and point C at (5, y), where y is the height of the rectangle. The length AD would be y, so AD = y.

Now, the Line(A,D) goes from (0,0) to (0,y), which is vertical. According to the predicate, Line(A,D) is parallel to Line(B,E). So Line(B,E) is parallel to AD, which is vertical. Therefore, Line(B,E) must also be vertical. Point B is at (5,0), so Line(B,E) is vertical, meaning E has the same x-coordinate as B, which is 5. So E is at (5, k) for some k.

Also, Line(A,B) is parallel to Line(D,E). Line(A,B) is horizontal from (0,0) to (5,0), so Line(D,E) must also be horizontal. Point D is at (0,y), and Line(D,E) must be horizontal, so E must have the same y-coordinate as D. Wait, because Line(D,E) is horizontal. So if D is at (0,y), then E must be at (x, y) for some x. But earlier, we said E is at (5,k) because Line(B,E) is vertical. So combining these, E must be at (5, y). Therefore, E is at (5, y).

Now, we know that Line(A,E) connects A(0,0) to E(5,y), and its length is 4. The distance between (0,0) and (5,y) is sqrt((5-0)^2 + (y-0)^2) = sqrt(25 + y²) = 4. Squaring both sides: 25 + y² = 16 → y² = -9. This is impossible. So this leads to a contradiction. Hence, there's a fundamental issue with the given data.

Wait, this suggests that with AB=5 and AE=4, and E at (5,y), the distance from A to E can't be 4 unless y is imaginary. Therefore, this indicates that the given data is inconsistent. This must mean there's a mistake in the problem setup. However, since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the coordinates aren't set as I assumed. Let me try a different approach. Suppose that the right angles at A and B are not both in the triangle, but rather, the angles are in different contexts. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E)) is at point B, so that's between A-B-E. The RightAngle(Angle(B,A,E)) is at point A, between B-A-E. So these are two separate angles, not necessarily part of the same triangle. But how can both exist?

Wait, if point E is positioned such that BA is perpendicular to BE and AB is perpendicular to AE. This would require that BE and AE are both perpendicular to AB, implying that BE and AE are in the same direction from B and A respectively. But since AB is a straight line, this would mean that points E lies along a line perpendicular to AB at B and also along a line perpendicular to AB at A. But those are two different lines. Hence, unless AB is zero length, which it isn't, E cannot lie on both lines. This suggests that the only way for both conditions to hold is if E is at infinity, which is impossible.

This indicates that the given problem contains conflicting information, making it unsolvable as stated. However, since this is a problem posed to me, I must proceed. Perhaps the error lies elsewhere. Let me check the parallel lines again. Line(A,B) is parallel to Line(D,E), and Line(A,D) is parallel to Line(B,E). In the rectangle, AB is parallel to DC, and AD is parallel to BC. So Line(D,E) is parallel to AB, and Line(B,E) is parallel to AD. Since AD is perpendicular to AB, Line(B,E) is perpendicular to AB, and Line(D,E) is parallel to AB. Hence, Line(D,E) is parallel to AB, which is horizontal if AB is horizontal. So, if AB is horizontal, then Line(D,E) is horizontal, and Line(B,E) is vertical. Thus, point E is located at the intersection of a vertical line through B and a horizontal line through D. Wait, since Line(D,E) is horizontal, so E has the same y-coordinate as D. And Line(B,E) is vertical, so E has the same x-coordinate as B. Hence, E is at (x_B, y_D), where x_B is the x-coordinate of B, and y_D is the y-coordinate of D.

Let me define coordinates again. Let me set A at (0,0). Since AB is 5 units long, let me put B at (5,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, D must be at (0, h), where h is the height of the rectangle. Then C is at (5, h). Now, Line(D,E) is horizontal, so E has the same y-coordinate as D, which is h. And Line(B,E) is vertical, so E has the same x-coordinate as B, which is 5. Therefore, E is at (5, h).

Now, the distance from A to E is 4. A is at (0,0), E is at (5,h). So the distance AE is sqrt((5-0)^2 + (h-0)^2) = sqrt(25 + h²) = 4. Squaring both sides: 25 + h² = 16 → h² = -9. Again, impossible. This suggests that the given data is impossible, making the problem invalid. 

However, since the problem exists, perhaps there's a different configuration. What if the rectangle is not aligned with the axes? Maybe it's rotated? But then calculating coordinates becomes more complex. Let me try.

Let me suppose that the rectangle is placed arbitrarily. Let me denote AB as vector from A to B, and AD as vector from A to D. Since AB and AD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. Let me assign coordinates such that A is at origin (0,0), B is at (a, 0), D is at (0, b), making AB = a, AD = b. Then C is at (a, b).

Now, Line(D,E) is parallel to AB, which has direction vector (a, 0). So Line(D,E) is horizontal, meaning E has the same y-coordinate as D, which is b. Line(B,E) is parallel to AD, which has direction vector (0, b), so it's vertical. Hence, E has the same x-coordinate as B, which is a. Therefore, E is at (a, b).

But then, distance from A to E is sqrt(a² + b²) = 4. Also, distance from B to E is sqrt((a-a)^2 + (b-0)^2) = b = 6. So b = 6. Then, from AE = 4, we have a² + 6² = 4² → a² = 16 - 36 = -20. Again, impossible. 

Thus, this confirms the earlier conclusion that the given data is inconsistent. Therefore, the problem as stated contains contradictions, making it unsolvable. However, since the problem is presented, perhaps there's an error in interpreting the given predicates.

Wait, let me revisit the original problem. The user provided certain predicates, including Right(Triangle(A,B,E)), which might not actually refer to the triangle with sides AB, BE, and AE, but instead to a different triangle. Or perhaps the lengths are not the sides of the triangle. Wait, the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 5) specifies that AB = 5. Similarly, BE = 6, and AE = 4. So these are the lengths of the sides of triangle ABE. But as shown, these lengths don't form a right triangle. Hence, the problem is flawed. 

But since the problem is given, perhaps I should ignore the inconsistency and proceed with the given data, assuming that the triangle is right-angled despite the lengths. Let's try to calculate the area of the rectangle and the triangle separately and sum them.

First, the rectangle ABCD. To find its area, I need the lengths of AB and AD. We know AB = 5. To find AD, note that AD is parallel to BE, and BE = 6. Since AD is a side of the rectangle, and BE is parallel to AD, but BE is not necessarily equal to AD. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AD = BC, and AB = CD. But how does BE relate to AD?

From earlier, Line(B,E) is parallel to AD. Since AD is a side of the rectangle, and BE is parallel to it. But BE = 6. If AD is parallel to BE, then AD and BE are corresponding sides, but their lengths may differ. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, but here we have a rectangle, which is a type of parallelogram. However, BE is not necessarily a side of the rectangle, it's a segment from B to E. 

Wait, but if Line(B,E) is parallel to AD, and AD is a side of the rectangle, then BE is parallel to AD. But BE is a line segment from B to E, and AD is a side of the rectangle. Since AD is a side of the rectangle, its length is equal to BC. However, the length of BE is 6. But since BE is parallel to AD, their lengths are not necessarily equal. So AD can be any length, but BE is 6. 

However, in our coordinate system earlier, we found that AD = b, and BE = 6, but this led to a contradiction. However, if we proceed regardless, let's assume that AD is some length, say, 'h'. Then, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = 5 * h.

Now, the area of triangle ABE: if it were a right triangle, its area would be (AB * BE)/2 = (5 * 6)/2 = 15. But since it's not a right triangle, this calculation is invalid. However, the problem states it is a right triangle, so we'll take this value. 

Then, the total area would be the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle. But wait, is the triangle overlapping with the rectangle? If E is outside the rectangle, then the total area would be the sum. But in our previous coordinate system, E was at (5, h), which is outside the rectangle if h > 0. But since we couldn't find h due to the contradiction, this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is just the rectangle, and the triangle is part of it. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to tell. Given the inconsistencies, I'm stuck. 

However, looking at the answer choices, the options are 7.1, 14.1, 22.1, 30.0. Given that the area of the rectangle would be 5 * h, and if we assume that h is such that AE = 4, but earlier calculations show that h would be imaginary, but perhaps taking absolute value or ignoring the sign, let's say h = sqrt(4^2 - 5^2) = sqrt(-9), which is not real. 

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the rectangle is 5 * 6 = 30, since BE is 6 and it's parallel to AD. But why would AD be 6? If BE is parallel to AD and BE = 6, then AD = 6, making the area of the rectangle 5 * 6 = 30. Then, the area of the triangle would be (5 * 6)/2 = 15, totaling 45, which isn't among the choices. 

Alternatively, if the area of the rectangle is 5 * 6 = 30, and the triangle is 12 (if it were a 3-4-5 triangle), but this is speculative. 

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 30.0, which might be the area of the rectangle. If the problem assumes that the area of the rectangle is 5 * 6 = 30, ignoring the contradictions, then the answer would be D. 

Given that the problem includes a right triangle with legs 5 and 6, which would have area 15, but the answer choices don't include 30 + 15 = 45. However, if the area is solely the rectangle, then 30.0 is option D. This might be the intended answer, assuming that the triangle's area is not added, or that the figure refers only to the rectangle. 

Considering the presence of the triangle in the predicates but the absence of explicit instruction to add it, and given that the answer D is 30.0, I'll go with that.
