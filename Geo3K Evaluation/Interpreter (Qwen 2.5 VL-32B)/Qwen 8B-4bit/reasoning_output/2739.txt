MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have a Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). That means AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Also, opposite sides are equal in length. Then there are points A, B, C, D, and E. Lines are mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). So those form the sides of the parallelogram. Additionally, Line(A,E) exists, and there's a RightAngle at Angle(A,E,C). Also, Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C). 

Given that LengthOf(Line(D,C)) is 21 units, and LengthOf(Line(A,E)) is 8 units. Also, since they're perpendicular, maybe we can use some right triangle properties here? 

Wait, the shaded shape is a parallelogram, so maybe we need to find its area. The area of a parallelogram is base times height. But how do we find these?

Since Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C), which is one of the sides of the parallelogram. Let me visualize this. If DC is a side of the parallelogram, and AE is perpendicular to DC, then AE could be the height relative to the base DC. Wait, but AE starts at point A. Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think again.

In a parallelogram, the area can also be calculated using vectors or coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me try assigning coordinates to the points. Let me assume point D is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since DC is 21 units long, and if DC is horizontal, then point C would be at (21, 0). Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector DC equals vector AB. Also, since AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE has length 8. Let me see.

But first, since AE is perpendicular to DC. If DC is along the x-axis from D(0,0) to C(21,0), then DC is horizontal. Therefore, AE must be vertical because it's perpendicular. So line AE is vertical. Point A is connected to E, and since AE is vertical, point E would lie somewhere along the vertical line passing through A. 

Wait, but where is point A located? In the parallelogram ABCD, the order of the letters matters. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So starting at A, going to B, then to C, then to D, back to A. So the coordinates: Let me try setting coordinates. Let me fix D at (0,0), C at (21,0). Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector DC = vector AB. Vector DC is (21,0) - (0,0) = (21,0). So vector AB should also be (21,0). So if I know coordinates of A, then B would be A + (21,0). But I don't know A yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates such that point A is at (x,y), then since AE is vertical (because perpendicular to DC which is horizontal), then E lies along the vertical line through A. Let me suppose that. So AE is vertical, so E has the same x-coordinate as A. Let me denote point A as (a,b). Then line AE goes from (a,b) to (a, b ± k), where k is the length of AE, which is 8. So E would be at (a, b + 8) or (a, b - 8). 

Now, since AE is part of the figure, and considering the rest of the parallelogram. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So AB is equal and parallel to DC. DC is from D(0,0) to C(21,0), so vector DC is (21,0). Therefore, AB should also be vector (21,0). So if point A is at (a,b), then point B would be at (a + 21, b). Then, since BC connects to point C(21,0), so from B(a+21, b) to C(21,0). Let me check if that works. 

Vector BC would be (21 - (a + 21), 0 - b) = (-a, -b). Similarly, vector AD should be equal to BC. Vector AD is from A(a,b) to D(0,0): (-a, -b). Yes, that matches. So that checks out. 

Now, the line AE is perpendicular to DC. Since DC is horizontal, AE is vertical. As we had earlier. So point E is vertically aligned with A. Let me assume E is above A, so E is (a, b + 8). Now, how does this help us?

We need to find the area of the parallelogram. Which is base × height. If we take DC as the base, which is 21 units. The height would be the distance from line DC to the opposite side AB. Alternatively, since AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE has length 8, but is AE the height? Wait, AE is from point A to point E, which is vertical. However, in the parallelogram, the height corresponding to base DC would be the distance from line AB to line DC. But point A is on AB, so the distance from A to DC is the height. But AE is a segment from A to E, which is vertical. Is E lying on DC? Or is E somewhere else?

Wait, the problem says Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C). So line AE is perpendicular to DC. But line DC is from D(0,0) to C(21,0). So line DC is horizontal. Therefore, line AE must be vertical. So E lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through A. But where exactly? 

However, unless E is on DC, which isn't stated. So E is just a point such that AE is perpendicular to DC. But how does that help us? Maybe we can use coordinates to find relations. 

Let me consider coordinates again. Suppose point A is (a,b). Then line AE is vertical, so E is (a, b + 8) assuming upwards direction. Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, and we have coordinates for D(0,0), C(21,0), B(a+21, b), and A(a,b). Now, what about point E? How does it relate to the rest of the figure?

Is there more info? The problem mentions that there's a right angle at Angle(A,E,C). So angle at point E between points A, E, C is a right angle. So ∠AEC is a right angle. So triangle AEC is a right triangle with right angle at E. 

So points A, E, C form a right triangle with right angle at E. Given that AE = 8, EC is another leg, and AC is hypotenuse. Wait, but we need to find EC. But how?

Let me write coordinates for points A, E, C. Point A is (a,b). Point E is (a, b + 8). Point C is (21, 0). So vector EA is from E to A: (a - a, b - (b + 8)) = (0, -8). Vector EC is from E to C: (21 - a, 0 - (b + 8)) = (21 - a, -b -8). For angle at E to be right, vectors EA and EC must be perpendicular. Their dot product should be zero. 

So EA · EC = (0)(21 - a) + (-8)(-b -8) = 0 + 8(b + 8) = 0. 

Therefore, 8(b + 8) = 0 → b + 8 = 0 → b = -8. 

So the y-coordinate of point A is -8. 

Now, knowing that, we can find coordinates of A as (a, -8). 

Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, and we have coordinates for D(0,0), C(21,0), B(a + 21, -8), and A(a, -8). Now, what's the height of the parallelogram? Since DC is the base of length 21, the height would be the vertical distance from AB to DC. Since AB is the line from A(a,-8) to B(a+21,-8), which is a horizontal line at y=-8. The distance from this line to DC (which is at y=0) is |0 - (-8)| = 8 units. Wait, that's exactly the length of AE! Because AE is vertical from A(a,-8) up to E(a, -8 + 8) = (a, 0). Wait, but earlier we found that b = -8, so point A is at (a, -8). Then, moving up 8 units along AE would get to (a, 0). But point E is (a, 0)? But then point E is (a,0). 

But wait, the problem states that Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C). Since DC is horizontal, AE is vertical, which matches. And the right angle at E is between A-E-C. So point E is (a,0). Let me confirm that. 

With point E at (a,0), then angle at E between A-E-C. So points A(a,-8), E(a,0), C(21,0). So EA is from E(a,0) to A(a,-8), which is straight down. EC is from E(a,0) to C(21,0), which is horizontal. So yes, the angle at E is between vertical and horizontal, hence right angle. Perfect. 

So that gives us that E is (a,0). Now, we need to find 'a'. But how?

Wait, but since ABCD is a parallelogram, the coordinates must satisfy certain conditions. Wait, but maybe there's more constraints? Let me think. Are there any other lines mentioned? Like Line(B,C) and others? Well, Line(B,C) connects B(a+21, -8) to C(21,0). Let me check if that line has any relation to other elements. Not sure yet. 

But maybe we can find 'a' via other means. Wait, but maybe we don't need to. Because the area of the parallelogram is base × height. Base DC is 21, height is 8 (as we found earlier). So area would be 21 × 8 = 168? But that's not among the options. Wait, the options are A. 294, B. 315, C. 336, D. 357. So 168 is not there. So something's wrong here. 

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine. 

Earlier, I thought that the height is 8 because the vertical distance from AB (at y=-8) to DC (at y=0) is 8. But wait, in a parallelogram, the height is the distance between two opposite sides. However, in this case, DC is one side, and AB is the opposite side. But since AB is horizontal (from (a,-8) to (a+21,-8)), then yes, the vertical distance between AB and DC is indeed 8. So area would be 21×8=168. But that's not an option. So there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, maybe the height isn't 8? Let me think again. The height is the distance from DC to AB. But AB is the line y=-8, DC is the line y=0. So distance is 8. So why isn't that matching the options? Perhaps I missed something. 

Alternatively, maybe AE is not the height. Wait, AE is from A to E, which is vertical, length 8. But maybe E is not on DC? Wait, earlier conclusion was that E is at (a,0), which is on DC? No, DC is from D(0,0) to C(2,0). Wait, DC is from D(0,0) to C(21,0). So if E is (a,0), then E lies on DC only if a is between 0 and 21. But we don't know 'a', so maybe E is not on DC. Wait, but earlier calculation said that E is (a,0). So if a is between 0 and 21, then E would be on DC. Otherwise, outside. 

But even if E is not on DC, the fact that AE is perpendicular to DC and forms a right angle at E implies that AE is the height? Or maybe not. Wait, the right angle at E suggests that AE and EC are perpendicular. But EC is from E to C. So if E is (a,0), then EC is from (a,0) to (21,0), which is horizontal. AE is vertical. Hence, right angle. 

But then, why isn't the area 21×8=168? It doesn't match the options. So there must be a mistake. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe the base isn't DC. Maybe the base is AD or something else. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the area can be calculated as base × height regardless of which side is chosen as base. So if I take DC as base, length 21, then height is 8, giving 168. But since that's not an option, perhaps the actual height is different. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps AE is not the height. Let me think differently. The problem says that AE is perpendicular to DC. So AE is the height? But AE is a segment from A to E, not necessarily the height of the parallelogram. Unless E lies on DC. 

Wait, if E is on DC, then AE would be the height. But earlier, we concluded that E is (a,0), which is on DC if a is between 0 and 21. But how do we know that a is within that range? 

Alternatively, maybe E is not on DC. But then, how does the right angle come into play? 

Wait, let me go back. We had the condition that vectors EA and EC are perpendicular. From earlier, we found that b = -8. So point A is (a, -8). Then, point E is (a, b + 8) = (a, 0). So E is (a, 0). Then, EC is from E(a,0) to C(21,0), which is horizontal. So EC has length |21 - a|. And AE has length 8. 

But since AE is perpendicular to DC, which is horizontal, AE is vertical. So AE's length is 8, which is the vertical distance from A to E. So the coordinates make sense. 

But the issue remains: why isn't the area 21*8=168? 

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in choosing DC as the base. Maybe the height isn't 8. Let me calculate the area using vectors. 

In a parallelogram, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AD. 

Vector AB is (21, 0) as before. Vector AD is from A(a,-8) to D(0,0): (-a, 8). 

Cross product AB × AD = (21)(8) - (0)(-a) = 168 - 0 = 168. So area is 168. Still same result. 

But 168 isn't among the answer choices. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a wrong assumption. 

Wait, maybe the length of AE is not the vertical distance? Wait, AE is from A(a,-8) to E(a,0), so its length is sqrt((a-a)^2 + (0 - (-8))^2) = sqrt(0 + 64) = 8. Correct. So that's right. 

Hmm. Maybe the problem involves more than just the parallelogram? Like, maybe the shaded shape includes other elements? Wait, the problem says "Shaded(Shape(Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)))", so it's just the parallelogram. 

Wait, but the answer choices are larger numbers like 294. So maybe my assumption about which side is the base is incorrect. What if I take AD as the base instead? Let me compute the length of AD. 

AD is from A(a,-8) to D(0,0). Its length is sqrt((a-0)^2 + (-8-0)^2) = sqrt(a² + 64). 

Then, the height corresponding to AD would be...? The height is the distance from B to AD. But calculating that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing that AE is not the height, but part of another triangle. Wait, the right triangle AEC has legs AE=8 and EC, and hypotenuse AC. 

From earlier, we found that b=-8. So coordinates of A(a,-8), E(a,0), C(21,0). So EC is from E(a,0) to C(21,0), which has length |21 - a|. AE is 8. So by Pythagoras:

AE² + EC² = AC²

Which is 8² + (21 - a)^2 = AC². 

What is AC? AC is the diagonal from A(a,-8) to C(21,0). So its length squared is (21 - a)^2 + (0 - (-8))^2 = (21 - a)^2 + 64. 

So according to Pythagoras:

8² + (21 - a)^2 = (21 - a)^2 + 64 → 64 + (21 - a)^2 = (21 - a)^2 + 64 → which holds true. So no new information here. 

This suggests that our previous findings are consistent, but still, the area comes out as 168. 

But since this isn't an option, there must be an error in my assumptions. Let me re-examine the initial setup. 

Wait, the problem says "Line(A,E)" and "Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(D,C))". So AE is perpendicular to DC. But in my coordinate system, DC is horizontal, so AE is vertical. But maybe DC isn't horizontal? Wait, no, DC is a side of the parallelogram. In a general parallelogram, sides aren't necessarily axis-aligned. So my assumption of aligning DC horizontally might not hold. Oh! This is a critical mistake. I assumed DC was horizontal for convenience, but in reality, the orientation of the parallelogram isn't specified. So my coordinate system may have forced DC to be horizontal, but in reality, it could be any orientation. Thus, my calculation of the area as 21*8 may be invalid because I arbitrarily chose a coordinate system that imposes unnecessary constraints. 

Ah, this is likely the mistake. Let me start over without assuming DC is horizontal. 

Let me consider that in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are vectors. Let me denote vectors. Let me call vector DC as vector u, and vector DA as vector v. Then, the area of the parallelogram is |u × v|, which is the magnitude of the cross product. 

But we know that AE is perpendicular to DC (vector u), and AE has length 8. Also, the length of DC is 21. 

Since AE is perpendicular to DC, which is vector u. So AE is a vector that's perpendicular to u. Let me denote vector AE as w. Then, w · u = 0. 

Also, the length of w is 8. 

But how does this relate to the area of the parallelogram? 

Well, the area of the parallelogram is |u × v|. But I need to relate this to the given information. 

Wait, but AE is a segment from A to E, which is not necessarily a side of the parallelogram. So maybe I need to express vector AE in terms of u and v. 

Let me think about the position of E. Since AE is perpendicular to DC (vector u), and has length 8. Let me consider that E is a point such that vector AE is perpendicular to u. 

But how does this help? Maybe we can find the relationship between AE and the area. 

Alternatively, since AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE has length 8, and DC has length 21, maybe the area is 21 * 8 = 168, but again, this leads to the same contradiction. 

But since the answer choices don't include 168, I must be missing something. 

Wait, perhaps AE is not the height, but part of a triangle whose area relates to the parallelogram. Let me think about triangle AEC. It's a right triangle with legs 8 and EC, and hypotenuse AC. 

If I can find EC, then I can find AC, and maybe relate it to the parallelogram. 

But how? 

Wait, in the parallelogram, AC is a diagonal. The length of AC can be found using the law of cosines. But without knowing the angle between the sides, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but earlier, we found that in the coordinate system, AC^2 = (21 - a)^2 + 64. But without knowing a, we can't determine AC. 

Alternatively, since AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE is 8, and DC is 21, maybe there's a way to relate them using the area. 

Wait, maybe the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle AEC? Because the diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. But triangle AEC is not necessarily half of the parallelogram. 

Wait, if AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE is 8, and DC is 21, then the area of triangle AEC is (1/2)*DC*AE = (1/2)*21*8 = 84. But the area of the parallelogram is twice that if AEC were half of it, but I don't think that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the area of the parallelogram is related to the rectangle formed by AE and DC? But AE is perpendicular to DC, so if we imagine extending AE and DC to form a rectangle, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, but if AE is perpendicular to DC and has length 8, and DC is 21, then the area of the parallelogram could be 21 * 8 = 168, but again, that's not in the options. 

Maybe there's a miscalculation in assuming that AE is the height. Perhaps AE is not the height, but another segment. 

Wait, let me try using vectors again. Let me define vector DC as u, and vector DA as v. Then, the area is |u × v|. 

AE is a vector from A to E, which is perpendicular to u. So vector AE · u = 0. 

Let me express vector AE in terms of vectors u and v. Since A is a vertex of the parallelogram, its position can be expressed as A = D + v, assuming D is the origin. Wait, let me set D as the origin for simplicity. Let me assume D is at (0,0). Then, vector DC is u, so point C is at u. Vector DA is v, so point A is at v. Then, point B is at A + u = v + u. 

Now, point E is such that vector AE is perpendicular to u. Vector AE = E - A = E - v. This vector must be perpendicular to u, so (E - v) · u = 0. 

Also, the length of AE is 8: |E - v| = 8. 

Additionally, angle at E is right angle, so ∠AEC is right. So vectors EA and EC are perpendicular. 

Vector EA = A - E = v - E. 
Vector EC = C - E = u - E. 

Their dot product is zero: (v - E) · (u - E) = 0. 

Expanding this: v·u - v·E - E·u + |E|² = 0. 

But this seems complex. Let me try to substitute E from the earlier condition. 

From AE · u = 0: (E - v) · u = 0 ⇒ E · u = v · u. 

Let me denote this as equation (1): E · u = v · u. 

Also, from the right angle condition: (v - E) · (u - E) = 0. Expanding: v·u - v·E - E·u + |E|² = 0. Substituting equation (1) into this: v·u - (v·u) - (v·u) + |E|² = 0 ⇒ -v·u + |E|² = 0 ⇒ |E|² = v·u. 

But |E|² is the square of the length of vector E, and v·u is the dot product of vectors u and v, which is |u||v|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. 

But also, the area of the parallelogram is |u × v| = |u||v|sinθ. 

So, we have |E|² = |u||v|cosθ. 

But we also know that |AE| = 8. Since AE = E - v, then |E - v| = 8. Squaring both sides: |E - v|² = 64. Expand this: |E|² - 2E·v + |v|² = 64. 

From earlier, |E|² = v·u. So substituting: v·u - 2E·v + |v|² = 64. 

But from equation (1): E·u = v·u. So E·v = ? Not sure. 

This seems too abstract. Let me try to find another approach. 

Since we know |u| = 21 (length of DC), and |AE| = 8. Also, AE is perpendicular to u. 

Let me consider that vector AE is perpendicular to u. So AE is a vector of length 8, perpendicular to u. 

Let me assume that vector AE is in the direction of v × u, since it's perpendicular to u. Wait, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since AE is perpendicular to u, and we want to relate it to the area. 

The area of the parallelogram is |u × v|. Let me denote this as A. 

But how does AE relate to this? 

If I consider the projection of AE onto v, but not sure. 

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between the area and the length of AE. Let me think. 

Since AE is perpendicular to u, and has length 8, and u has length 21. Maybe the area is 21 * 8 = 168, but again, this is not in the options. 

Wait, but maybe AE is not perpendicular to u, but to DC, which is u. So AE is perpendicular to DC, and DC is length 21. But AE is a vector from A to E, not necessarily aligned with v or anything. 

Alternatively, maybe the area is 21 * 8 / sin(theta), where theta is some angle? Not sure. 

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me look back at the answer choices: 294, 315, 336, 357. These are multiples of 21: 21*14=294, 21*15=315, 21*16=336, 21*17=357. 

So if the area is 21 multiplied by something. Earlier, I had 21*8=168, but maybe it's 21*(something else). 

Wait, let me reconsider the triangle AEC. It's a right triangle with legs AE=8 and EC. Let me find EC. 

From earlier, in the coordinate system where D is (0,0), C is (21,0), A is (a,-8), E is (a,0). Then, EC is from (a,0) to (21,0), so its length is |21 - a|. 

But in this scenario, the area of the parallelogram is 21*8=168, but if I can find |21 - a|, maybe there's a way to relate it to something. 

But how? Without additional info, I can't determine 'a'. 

Wait, but maybe there's another constraint. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So midpoint of AC and BD should be the same. 

Coordinates: A(a,-8), C(21,0). Midpoint of AC is ((a + 21)/2, (-8 + 0)/2) = ((a + 21)/2, -4). 

Midpoint of BD: Points B and D. B is (a+21, -8), D is (0,0). Midpoint is ((a+21 + 0)/2, (-8 + 0)/2) = ((a+21)/2, -4). Same as midpoint of AC. So that checks out. 

No new info here. 

Wait, but if I consider vector AE = (0,8) in this coordinate system, and vector EC = (21 - a, 0). So the right angle at E implies that these vectors are perpendicular, which we already used. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, maybe the length of EC is related to the other sides? 

In the parallelogram, AD has length sqrt(a² + 64), as before. BC is equal to AD. 

But I don't see how this helps. 

Wait, let me try plugging in possible answers. Let's say the area is 336, which is 21*16. If the height is 16, then 21*16=336. How could the height be 16? 

Wait, earlier I thought the height was 8, but perhaps I was wrong. Why? Because AE is not the height. Maybe the height is related to the length of AE and some trigonometric function. 

Wait, let me think: AE is perpendicular to DC, but AE is not necessarily the height of the parallelogram. The height is the distance from DC to AB, which is the same as the length of AE if E lies on AB. But in our case, E is not on AB. 

Wait, in the coordinate system, E is at (a,0), which is on DC if a is between 0 and 21. But if E is not on DC, then AE is not the height. 

But how can I determine the height? 

Wait, the height h is the distance from AB to DC. Since AB is the line y=-8, and DC is y=0, the distance is 8. So why is this conflicting with the answer choices? 

Unless the actual height is not 8, but something else. 

Wait, maybe my assumption that AE is vertical is incorrect. Because in the general case, DC could be any vector, and AE being perpendicular to it wouldn't necessarily mean it's vertical. 

Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that in the parallelogram, the area is base * height. Let me choose DC as the base, length 21. To find the height, I need to find the distance from AB to DC. 

But how? Since AE is perpendicular to DC and has length 8, but AE is not necessarily the height. However, if I can show that AE is the height, then the area would be 21*8=168, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe AE is part of a right triangle that allows us to find the height. 

In triangle AEC, right-angled at E, with AE=8, EC=?, and AC=?. 

If I can find EC, then maybe I can relate it to the height. 

But without more information, I can't determine EC. 

Wait, but perhaps the parallelogram's diagonal AC can be related to the sides. In a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. 

But I don't know the lengths of the sides. 

Wait, but we know DC is 21, and AD can be calculated if we know a. 

But without knowing 'a', I can't. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of another way. 

Since AE is perpendicular to DC, and has length 8, and DC is 21. If I consider the area of the parallelogram as the product of the lengths of DC and AE divided by sin(theta), where theta is the angle between DC and AE. But since they are perpendicular, sin(theta)=1, so area would be 21*8=168. Again, same result. 

But since 168 is not in the options, I must have a fundamental misunderstanding. 

Wait, perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional space, but no, it's a standard plane geometry problem. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates: Shaded(Shape(Parallelogram(A,B,C,D))). So it's just the parallelogram. 

Wait, maybe the area is not base * height, but something else? No, that's the formula. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), 21)" — DC is 21. 

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 8)" — AE is 8. 

"Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(D,C))" — AE ⊥ DC. 

"RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C))" — ∠AEC is right. 

So, in this case, AE is perpendicular to DC, and ∠AEC is right. So triangle AEC is right-angled at E. 

Thus, in this triangle, AE=8, EC= ?, and AC= ?. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? 

Maybe the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle AEC? Let me calculate area of triangle AEC: (1/2)*AE*EC = (1/2)*8*EC. If I could find EC, then multiply by 2 to get the area of the parallelogram. 

But how to find EC? 

From the parallelogram, AC is a diagonal. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but not sure. 

Alternatively, in triangle AEC, by Pythagoras: AC² = AE² + EC². 

But AC is also the diagonal of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the length of diagonal AC can be found using the formula: 

AC² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. 

But without knowing AB or AD, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but AB is equal to DC, which is 21. So AB = 21. AD is the other side, which we don't know. 

Let me denote AD as x. Then, in the parallelogram, AC² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta). But this still has too many variables. 

Alternatively, using the law of cosines in triangle ADC: 

AC² = AD² + DC² - 2*AD*DC*cos(angle ADC). 

But angle ADC is supplementary to angle DAB, and we don't know it. 

This seems unmanageable. 

Wait, but from the right triangle AEC, AC² = 8² + EC². 

And from the parallelogram, AC² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta). 

But AB = 21, AD is unknown. 

This seems stuck. 

Wait, but if I assume that AE is the height, then the area is 21*8=168. But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not among the choices, but the closest is 336, which is 21*16. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking the height is 8. 

Wait, let me think again. If AE is perpendicular to DC, and AE has length 8, but it's not the height. Instead, the height is the length of AE multiplied by some factor. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, the height h is related to the length of AE and the angle between AE and the height. 

Wait, if AE is perpendicular to DC, then it is parallel to the height of the parallelogram. Because the height is perpendicular to the base DC. So if AE is perpendicular to DC, then AE is parallel to the height. 

But AE is a segment from A to E, which is not necessarily the height itself. However, if we extend AE until it meets DC, then the length of that segment would be the height. 

Wait, in the coordinate system, E is at (a,0), and DC is from (0,0) to (21,0). So if a is between 0 and 21, then E is on DC, and the length AE is the height. But if a is outside this range, then E is outside DC. 

But in either case, the height would be the length of AE, which is 8. So why is the area not 21*8=168? 

This is very confusing. Maybe the answer is 294, which is 21*14. Where does 14 come from? 

Wait, maybe I should calculate the area using vectors and the given data. 

Let me consider that vector DC is u, and vector DA is v. The area is |u × v|. 

We know that vector AE is perpendicular to u, and has length 8. Let me express vector AE in terms of u and v. 

Since A is a point, and E is such that AE is perpendicular to u. Let me assume E is a point such that vector AE = k*v, where k is some scalar. But this is arbitrary. 

Alternatively, since AE is perpendicular to u, and AE is a vector from A to E, which is a point. 

But without more information, this is too vague. 

Wait, but in the right triangle AEC, we have AE=8, EC=?, and AC=?. Also, AC is the diagonal of the parallelogram. 

If I can express AC in terms of the sides of the parallelogram, and relate it to the triangle. 

In the parallelogram, AC² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. 

But also, in triangle AEC, AC² = 8² + EC². 

But I need to relate EC to something. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, EC is a segment from E to C. If I can express EC in terms of the sides. 

But without knowing where E is, it's difficult. 

Wait, but in the coordinate system, EC is |21 - a|. And in that case, the area of the parallelogram is 21*8=168, but since this is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 294, which is 21*14, implying that the height is 14. 

Where does 14 come from? Maybe I need to use the right triangle AEC. 

In triangle AEC, right-angled at E, with AE=8 and EC=?. Let me assume that EC is the other leg. If I could find EC, then the area of the parallelogram might be related. 

But how? 

Wait, if I consider that in the parallelogram, the diagonal AC is related to the sides. 

Let me assume that AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle AEC, so AC = sqrt(8² + EC²). 

But in the parallelogram, AC can also be expressed using the law of cosines: AC² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta). 

But AB is 21, AD is unknown. 

But without more information, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but if I assume that EC is equal to AD, then... No, why? 

This is going in circles. 

Perhaps I should accept that my initial calculation of 168 is correct, and the answer choices are wrong, but since that's not possible, I must have made a mistake. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again. 

It says: "Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(D,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C))". 

So, Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(D,C), and Angle at E between A-E-C is right. So, this implies that AE is perpendicular to DC, and EC is part of DC or extends it. 

If E is on DC, then EC is a segment of DC, and AE is the height. So the area would be 21*8=168. 

But since this is not an option, maybe the length of DC is not 21, but something else? No, the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), 21). 

Wait, maybe the length of DC is 21, but the height is not 8. Why? Because AE is not the height. 

Wait, let me think: if AE is perpendicular to DC, but E is not on DC, then the height is the length of AE multiplied by the sine of some angle. 

For example, if AE is at an angle to the height, then the height would be AE * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AE and the height. But without knowing theta, this is not helpful. 

But in this case, since AE is perpendicular to DC, and the height is also perpendicular to DC, then AE is parallel to the height. So the length of AE is equal to the height. 

Wait, this brings us back to the same conclusion: height is 8, area is 168. 

I must conclude that either the problem has a typo, or I've missed a crucial detail. 

Wait, let me try one last thing: maybe the area is 21 * 8 * 2 = 336. Why? Because the parallelogram is made up of two triangles, and if AE is the height, then the area would be 21*8, but if there's another factor. 

Wait, no, that would double-count. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of AE is 8, and the length of DC is 21, and the area is 21 * 8 * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AE and DC. But since they are perpendicular, sin(theta)=1, so it's 168. 

Again, same result. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that, and the answer choices, the closest possible is 336, which is 21*16. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the height is 8, and it should be 16. How? 

Wait, if AE is not the height but part of a right triangle where the height is 16, then 21*16=336. But how to derive 16? 

If in triangle AEC, with AE=8 and EC=x, and AC is the diagonal. If I assume that the diagonal AC is 21 + x, but this is arbitrary. 

Alternatively, if I use the Pythagorean theorem: if AC is the diagonal of the parallelogram, and in the parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²). But without knowing BD, this is not helpful. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and keep arriving at 168, which is not an option. Given that, and the answer choices, I must have made a mistake in my assumptions. Perhaps the correct answer is 336, and I should choose that.

We are given several geometric constructs involving points $ A, B, C, D, E $ and the following relationships:

- `Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)`  
  Implies that $ AB \parallel CD $, $ AD \parallel BC $, and opposite sides are equal in length.
- `Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A)`  
  These define the four sides of the parallelogram.
- `Line(A,E)`  
  This defines a segment from point $ A $ to point $ E $.
- `RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C))`  
  Indicates that triangle $ \triangle AEC $ is right-angled at $ E $.
