Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a kite named WXYZ, and some points and lines given. The question asks for WP. Let me start by recalling what a kite is. A kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. Also, the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and one of the diagonals is the axis of symmetry.

Looking at the given predicates: Kite(W,X,Y,Z). That means it's a quadrilateral with those four points forming a kite. Then there are several lines mentioned: Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,W). These form the sides of the kite. Also, Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z) are mentioned. Wait, these are the diagonals? Because in a kite, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So, WY and XZ would be the diagonals. 

Also, there's a Perpendicular predicate between Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z). So that confirms the diagonals are perpendicular. Another thing is that the length of WX is 6, XY is 4, YZ is 6, and ZW is 6. So looking at the sides: WX = ZW = 6, and XY = YZ = 4? Wait, but in a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So maybe the sides are WX and WZ equal, and XY and YZ equal? But the order here is W-X-Y-Z-W. So if it's a kite, then adjacent sides should be equal. Let me check the lengths again. 

Given:
Length(WX)=6, Length(XY)=4, Length(YZ)=6, Length(ZW)=6. So sides WX and ZW are both 6, and XY and YZ are both 4. That fits the definition of a kite where two distinct pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So the kite has sides WX=ZW=6 and XY=YZ=4. Therefore, the vertices are ordered such that sides WX and WZ are one pair, and sides XY and YZ are another pair. 

Now, the diagonals are WY and XZ. Since they're perpendicular, and intersect at point P. There's also a predicate stating that IntersectionOf(Line(W,Y), Line(X,Z), Point(P)). So point P is the intersection of the diagonals. And since the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, that gives us a right angle at P. 

Additionally, there's a RightAngle(Angle(X,Z,Y)) which I think refers to angle at Z between points X, Z, Y. Wait, Angle(X,Z,Y) would be the angle at point Z between points X and Y. So that's angle XZY. Hmm. Also, Point P lies on both diagonals WY and XZ, so P is the intersection point. 

Moreover, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,P)), LengthOf(Line(P,Z))). So XP equals PZ. Which suggests that point P is the midpoint of diagonal XZ because XP=PZ. Wait, but in a kite, the diagonals aren't necessarily bisecting each other unless it's a rhombus. However, in a kite, one diagonal is bisected by the other. Specifically, the longer diagonal is bisected by the shorter one. Wait, but here, since the diagonals are perpendicular, and if one of them is bisected, then maybe?

Wait, but the given condition here is that XP = PZ, which implies that P is the midpoint of XZ. But in a kite, usually, only one diagonal is bisected. For example, in a kite with unequal diagonals, the diagonal connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet is bisected by the other diagonal. Wait, perhaps in this case, since the sides WX and WZ are equal (both 6), and sides XY and YZ are equal (both 4), then the diagonals would be WY and XZ. In this case, the diagonal XZ (connecting X and Z) would be bisected by the other diagonal WY. But how does that relate to point P?

But according to the given, XP = PZ, which would mean that P is the midpoint of XZ. So that suggests that diagonal XZ is being bisected by the other diagonal WY. Which aligns with the property of kites where one diagonal is bisected by the other. So in this case, since the sides adjacent to X and Z are equal (XY=YZ=4), then the diagonal XZ is the one that's bisected by the other diagonal WY. Hence, point P is the midpoint of XZ.

So, our goal is to find the length WP. Since P is the intersection of the diagonals, and we know that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Also, since XP = PZ, and we might need to use coordinates or Pythagoras to find WP.

Let me try to model this. Maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me place the kite in coordinate system. Let me consider point Z and X. Since XZ is a diagonal, and P is its midpoint. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity.

Alternatively, since we know the lengths of the sides, perhaps we can compute the lengths of the diagonals using the properties of kites. Wait, but how?

In a kite, the area can be computed as half the product of the diagonals. Also, the area can be calculated as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the diagonals. Alternatively, since we know the side lengths and the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the formula involving the sides and the diagonals.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on the triangles formed by the diagonals. Let me denote the diagonals as follows: d1 = WY (the diagonal connecting W and Y), and d2 = XZ (connecting X and Z). We know that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, so they form right angles. Also, the diagonals divide the kite into four right triangles.

Since XP = PZ, then XZ is split into two equal parts by P. So XZ is of length 2*XP. But we don't know XP yet. But maybe we can find relations between the diagonals.

Another thought: since we know the lengths of the sides, perhaps we can find the lengths of the diagonals using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me consider triangles formed by the diagonals.

For instance, take triangle WXY. Wait, but maybe better to look at triangles formed by the diagonals. Let me think.

Each side of the kite is part of a triangle with the diagonals. For example, in the kite WXYZ, the diagonals WY and XZ intersect at P. Let me note that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, so triangle WPX, XPY, YPZ, and ZPW are all right triangles.

But since XP = PZ, then in triangle XZW, which is split into two right triangles by the diagonal WY. Wait, maybe not directly helpful. Let me try to express the sides in terms of the segments of the diagonals.

Let me denote:

Let’s suppose that diagonal WY has length d1, and XZ has length d2. Since P is the midpoint of XZ, then XP = PZ = d2 / 2.

In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, so each of the four triangles formed is a right triangle. Now, considering the sides of the kite:

For example, side WX is 6. This side connects point W to X. In the diagram, this would be the hypotenuse of triangle WPX, which is a right triangle with legs WP and XP. Similarly, side WZ is 6, which would be the hypotenuse of triangle WPZ, with legs WP and PZ. Since XP = PZ, then these two triangles are congruent, which makes sense because WX and WZ are equal.

Similarly, sides XY and YZ are both 4. Let's consider triangle XPY and YPZ. Wait, but XY connects X to Y. Let me think about triangle XYP. It's a right triangle with legs XP and PY, and hypotenuse XY = 4. Similarly, YZ is the hypotenuse of triangle YPZ, with legs PZ and PY, and hypotenuse YZ = 4. Since XP = PZ, and PY is common, then these triangles are congruent. Therefore, PY is the same for both.

So, let's formalize this.

Let me denote:

Let’s call the length of WP as a, and the length of PY as b. Since the entire diagonal WY is divided into WP + PY = a + b.

Similarly, since XZ is split into XP = PZ = c (since XP = PZ). So XZ = 2c.

From the right triangles:

For triangle WPX: WX^2 = WP^2 + XP^2 → 6^2 = a^2 + c^2 → 36 = a² + c² ... (1)

For triangle XYP: XY^2 = XP^2 + PY^2 → 4^2 = c² + b² → 16 = c² + b² ... (2)

Similarly, for triangle YPZ: YZ^2 = PZ^2 + PY^2 → 4^2 = c² + b² → same as equation (2).

And for triangle ZPW: WZ^2 = WP^2 + PZ^2 → same as equation (1): 6² = a² + c².

So equations (1) and (2) are the main ones.

We need more equations to solve for variables. Let's see. What else do we know?

In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and one of them is bisected. As per earlier, since sides XY and YZ are equal, then the diagonal XZ is bisected by WY. Therefore, the segment PZ = XP = c, and the other diagonal WY is split into WP = a and PY = b. 

But there's another relation here: in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the longer diagonal is bisected. Wait, actually, in a kite, one diagonal is bisected by the other. Which one? The one connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet. Wait, in this case, the equal sides are WX=WZ and XY=YZ. So the vertices where the equal sides meet are W and Y. Therefore, the diagonal connecting W and Y is the one that's bisected? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in a kite, the axis of symmetry is along the longer diagonal. Wait, but without knowing which diagonal is longer, maybe we can infer from the given side lengths.

Let me calculate the lengths of the diagonals. From equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): 36 = a² + c²

Equation (2): 16 = c² + b²

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1): 36 - 16 = a² + c² - (c² + b²) ⇒ 20 = a² - b².

So, a² - b² = 20. 

But we need another equation to relate a and b. How?

Well, the entire diagonal WY is a + b. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area of the kite is (d1*d2)/2 = ( (a + b)*2c ) / 2 = c(a + b). 

Alternatively, the area can also be calculated as the sum of the areas of the four triangles. Each triangle's area is (base * height)/2. For example, area of triangle WPX is (a*c)/2, similarly for others. Total area would be 2*(a*c)/2 + 2*(b*c)/2 = a*c + b*c = c(a + b). Same as before.

But maybe another approach: since we know the sides, perhaps using the law of cosines? Wait, but maybe not necessary. Let me think if there's another relation.

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at P, and in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the longer diagonal is bisected. Wait, but earlier, we had that the diagonal XZ is bisected by WY. So that would imply that the diagonal XZ is the one that's bisected, hence XZ is the one that is split into two equal parts. Thus, in this case, the diagonal XZ is the one that is bisected, which is why XP = PZ. Therefore, the other diagonal WY is not bisected; instead, it's split into segments WP and PY, which may not be equal. 

Therefore, in this scenario, the diagonal WY is not necessarily bisected, but the diagonal XZ is. So, the relationship between a and b comes from the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides.

But how to get another equation. Perhaps using the fact that the entire kite's sides can be connected via the diagonals?

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides are made up of the legs of the right triangles. So, we have:

From the first equation: a² + c² = 36 ...(1)

Second equation: c² + b² = 16 ...(2)

We also have that the entire diagonal WY is a + b. But how to relate this?

Wait, but maybe there's another relation from the triangles. For example, considering triangle WXY. Wait, but WXY is not a right triangle. However, we could consider the entire kite's structure.

Alternatively, maybe we can find expressions for a and b in terms of c.

From equation (1): a² = 36 - c²

From equation (2): b² = 16 - c²

Thus, a² - b² = (36 - c²) - (16 - c²) = 36 - c² -16 + c² = 20. Which matches our previous conclusion that a² - b² = 20.

But we still need another equation. However, perhaps there's something missing here. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, maybe the fact that the diagonals intersect at P, and in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. But that's already considered. Is there a relation between the lengths of the diagonals?

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the entire kite's perimeter? No, since the perimeter isn't given. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any info about perimeter. So maybe we need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the value of c from somewhere. Let's think. 

Suppose we consider the entire length of diagonal XZ, which is 2c. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area of the kite is (d1*d2)/2 = ((a + b)*(2c))/2 = c(a + b). 

But also, the area can be found by adding up the areas of the four triangles. However, without knowing the area, this might not help. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that in a kite, the diagonals satisfy certain relations. For example, in a kite with two pairs of adjacent sides a and b, the lengths of the diagonals can be found using the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem. 

Alternatively, since we have two equations:

a² = 36 - c²

and 

b² = 16 - c²

So, if we can find another equation relating a and b, we can solve for c. 

But how?

Wait, maybe considering triangle WYZ? Not sure. Or perhaps considering that the diagonals are perpendicular, so the sum of squares of the sides equals the sum of squares of the diagonals?

Wait, in general, in any quadrilateral, the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals plus 4 times the square of the midline. But since this is a kite, maybe that simplifies. Alternatively, since it's a kite, maybe there's a simpler relation.

Alternatively, in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, so using the formula:

For any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, the sum of the squares of the sides equals twice the sum of the squares of the diagonals. Wait, no, that's for a parallelogram. Wait, let me recall: In a quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals. 

Yes! For any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, the formula holds:

AB² + BC² + CD² + DA² = AC² + BD².

So applying this to our kite WXYZ, where AC and BD are the diagonals. Let me label the diagonals:

Diagonal 1: WY (let's say length d1 = a + b)

Diagonal 2: XZ (length d2 = 2c)

Then the formula becomes:

WX² + XY² + YZ² + ZW² = WY² + XZ²

Plugging in the known values:

WX = 6, XY = 4, YZ = 6, ZW = 6.

So left-hand side:

6² + 4² + 6² + 6² = 36 + 16 + 36 + 36 = 36+36=72, 72+16=88, 88+36=124.

Right-hand side: (a + b)^2 + (2c)^2.

So:

124 = (a + b)^2 + 4c².

Now, expand (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

We already have from equations (1) and (2):

a² = 36 - c²,

b² = 16 - c².

So substituting into (a + b)^2:

a² + 2ab + b² = (36 - c²) + (16 - c²) + 2ab = 52 - 2c² + 2ab.

So overall:

124 = 52 - 2c² + 2ab + 4c² = 52 + 2c² + 2ab.

Rearranged:

124 - 52 = 2c² + 2ab ⇒ 72 = 2c² + 2ab ⇒ Divide both sides by 2: 36 = c² + ab.

So, we have:

c² + ab = 36. ... (3)

Now, we need another equation to solve for variables. But so far, we have:

From earlier:

a² = 36 - c² ... (1)

b² = 16 - c² ... (2)

And equation (3): c² + ab = 36.

Hmm. So, how can we proceed? Let me think.

We can express a and b in terms of c, then substitute into equation (3). Let me attempt that.

From equation (1): a = sqrt(36 - c²)

From equation (2): b = sqrt(16 - c²)

Plug into equation (3):

c² + [sqrt(36 - c²)] * [sqrt(16 - c²)] = 36

This seems complicated, but maybe squaring both sides would help. Let me rearrange:

Let me write:

sqrt((36 - c²)(16 - c²)) = 36 - c²

Wait, wait. Equation (3) is:

c² + sqrt[(36 - c²)(16 - c²)] = 36

Let me isolate the square root term:

sqrt[(36 - c²)(16 - c²)] = 36 - c²

Square both sides:

Left side squared: (36 - c²)(16 - c²)

Right side squared: (36 - c²)^2

Therefore:

(36 - c²)(16 - c²) = (36 - c²)^2

Assuming 36 - c² ≠ 0 (we can check later if c² = 36 is a solution), we can divide both sides by (36 - c²):

16 - c² = 36 - c² ⇒ 16 = 36, which is impossible. So contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that 36 - c² ≠ 0 must be wrong. So, 36 - c² = 0 ⇒ c² = 36 ⇒ c = 6. But c is half of XZ, so XZ = 2c = 12. But then plugging back into equation (2): b² = 16 - c² = 16 - 36 = -20, which is impossible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Which suggests that my approach is flawed. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! When I applied the formula for the sum of squares of sides in a quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals. Wait, the formula states that AB² + BC² + CD² + DA² = AC² + BD². But in this case, the kite is a convex quadrilateral, and the diagonals are perpendicular. So that formula should hold. However, when I tried to apply it, I ended up with a contradiction, implying an error in derivation. Let me recheck the calculation.

Original left-hand side was 6² + 4² + 6² + 6² = 36 + 16 + 36 + 36 = 124. Correct.

Right-hand side: (a + b)^2 + (2c)^2.

Which expands to a² + 2ab + b² + 4c². Correct.

Then substituting a² = 36 - c² and b² = 16 - c²:

Total expression becomes (36 - c²) + (16 - c²) + 2ab + 4c² = 52 - 2c² + 2ab + 4c² = 52 + 2c² + 2ab. Correct.

Setting equal to 124: 52 + 2c² + 2ab = 124 → 2c² + 2ab = 72 → c² + ab = 36. Correct.

So that part is correct.

But then when trying to solve for c, I assumed that 36 - c² is non-zero, leading to a contradiction. So the only possibility is that 36 - c² = 0, which gives c² = 36, but then b² = 16 - 36 = -20, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the assumptions.

Hmm. This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given data, but since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made an error in reasoning.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula for the sum of squares of the sides in a quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is different. Let me double-check the formula.

Actually, the formula for a quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is indeed:

AB² + BC² + CD² + DA² = AC² + BD².

Yes, that's correct. For example, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me test with a square. Suppose a square with side length s, then diagonals are s√2. Sum of squares of sides: 4s². Sum of squares of diagonals: 2*(s²*2) = 4s². So yes, equality holds.

So why in our case is there a contradiction? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me redo the substitution.

From equation (3): c² + ab = 36.

But also, from equations (1) and (2):

a² = 36 - c²,

b² = 16 - c².

But we also can find ab in terms of c. Let me consider multiplying equations (1) and (2):

a² * b² = (36 - c²)(16 - c²)

Which is equal to (ab)^2 = (36 - c²)(16 - c²)

But from equation (3): ab = 36 - c².

So, (ab)^2 = (36 - c²)^2.

Therefore:

(36 - c²)(16 - c²) = (36 - c²)^2

Assuming 36 - c² ≠ 0, divide both sides by (36 - c²):

16 - c² = 36 - c² ⇒ 16 = 36, which is false.

So this implies that the only solution is when 36 - c² = 0, i.e., c² = 36. But then as before, this leads to b² = 16 - 36 = -20, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's no real solution under these conditions, which contradicts the existence of the given problem. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my earlier assumptions.

Let me backtrack. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that the diagonals are WY and XZ. Wait, the given predicates mention Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z), which are the diagonals. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe my interpretation of the kite's structure is incorrect. Let me verify the kite's structure again.

A kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides equal. Given the points W, X, Y, Z in order, forming a quadrilateral. The sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Given that WX = ZW = 6 and XY = YZ = 4. So the kite has sides WX=ZW=6 and XY=YZ=4. Thus, the vertex order is such that sides WX and WZ are adjacent and equal, and sides XY and YZ are adjacent and equal. Hence, the diagonals are WY and XZ.

In a kite, one of the diagonals is the axis of symmetry and is bisected by the other. The diagonal connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet is the one that's bisected. Here, the equal sides are WX and WZ meeting at W, and XY and YZ meeting at Y. Therefore, the diagonal connecting W and Y (diagonal WY) is the axis of symmetry and is bisected by the other diagonal XZ. Wait, no—wait, in a kite, the axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal. Wait, but which diagonal is longer?

In our case, the diagonals are WY and XZ. To determine which is longer, we can consider the sides. Since the sides adjacent to W are WX=6 and WZ=6, while the sides adjacent to Y are XY=4 and YZ=4. So the diagonal connecting W and Y (WY) is likely longer than XZ. But how to confirm?

Alternatively, maybe my earlier assumption that diagonal XZ is bisected by WY is wrong. Perhaps it's the other way around. Let me reconsider.

In a kite, the diagonal connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet is the one that is bisected. Wait, the equal sides meet at W and Y. So the diagonal connecting W and Y is the one that is bisected by the other diagonal. Wait, that would mean that the diagonal WY is bisected by XZ. But in that case, the intersection point P would be the midpoint of WY. But the given condition says that XP = PZ, implying that P is the midpoint of XZ. So there's a conflict here.

This suggests that my earlier understanding of which diagonal is bisected is incorrect. Let me refer to standard kite properties.

According to standard properties of a kite:

- One of the diagonals is the perpendicular bisector of the other. The diagonal that is the perpendicular bisector is the one connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet. Wait, no, more accurately: In a kite, the diagonal connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet is the one that is bisected by the other diagonal. Wait, no—actually, in a kite, one diagonal is bisected by the other. The axis of symmetry is the longer diagonal, and it is bisected by the shorter diagonal. Wait, no, it depends on the lengths.

Let me look up the properties of a kite's diagonals:

In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. One of the diagonals is the perpendicular bisector of the other. The diagonal that is the perpendicular bisector is the one connecting the vertices where the equal sides meet. This diagonal is bisected by the other diagonal. Wait, no—the diagonal that is the perpendicular bisector is the one that is bisected by the other diagonal?

No, let me clarify. In a kite, the diagonal that connects the vertices where the equal sides meet is the one that is not bisected. Instead, it is the other diagonal that is bisected. Let me think of a typical kite shape: imagine a kite with two pairs of adjacent sides. The axis of symmetry runs along the longer diagonal. This diagonal is not bisected by the other diagonal. The other diagonal is bisected by the axis of symmetry.

So, if the equal sides meet at W and Y, then the diagonal connecting W and Y is the axis of symmetry and is not bisected. The other diagonal (connecting X and Z) is bisected by the axis of symmetry. Hence, point P, the intersection of the diagonals, lies on the axis of symmetry (WY) and bisects the other diagonal XZ. Therefore, XP = PZ, which matches the given condition. So, in this case, the diagonal XZ is bisected by WY, so P is the midpoint of XZ.

With this correction, the earlier equations might make sense. So, returning to the previous equations.

We had:

From triangle WPX: a² + c² = 36 ...(1)

From triangle XYP: c² + b² = 16 ...(2)

Where a is WP, b is PY, and c is XP = PZ.

But since diagonal XZ is bisected by WY, and P is the midpoint of XZ, then XP = PZ = c.

Also, the diagonal WY is divided into WP = a and PY = b. Since the axis of symmetry is WY, and it is not bisected, so a and b are not necessarily equal.

Now, using the formula for the sum of squares of the sides:

AB² + BC² + CD² + DA² = AC² + BD².

Which gave us the equation 124 = (a + b)^2 + (2c)^2.

Expanding:

124 = a² + 2ab + b² + 4c².

From equations (1) and (2):

a² = 36 - c²

b² = 16 - c²

Substituting into the expanded equation:

124 = (36 - c²) + (16 - c²) + 2ab + 4c²

Simplify:

36 + 16 - 2c² + 2ab + 4c² = 52 + 2c² + 2ab = 124

So, 52 + 2c² + 2ab = 124 → 2c² + 2ab = 72 → c² + ab = 36 ...(3)

Now, we also have from equations (1) and (2):

a² = 36 - c² ...(1)

b² = 16 - c² ...(2)

Let me multiply equations (1) and (2):

a² * b² = (36 - c²)(16 - c²) ...(4)

But from equation (3), ab = 36 - c². Squaring both sides gives (ab)^2 = (36 - c²)^2. So:

(ab)^2 = (36 - c²)^2

But from equation (4), (ab)^2 = (36 - c²)(16 - c²)

Thus:

(36 - c²)(16 - c²) = (36 - c²)^2

Assuming 36 - c² ≠ 0, divide both sides:

16 - c² = 36 - c² → 16 = 36, which is impossible.

So again, contradiction. This suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's an error in assumptions.

Wait, but this is a math competition-style problem, so there must be a solution. Let me consider that maybe the formula I used is incorrect. Let me re-examine the formula for quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals.

Upon checking, the correct formula for a quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is indeed AB² + BC² + CD² + DA² = AC² + BD².

But maybe in this case, the diagonals are not just perpendicular but also satisfy other properties due to the kite structure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the signs when expanding. Let me re-calculate the expansion.

Wait, the sum of squares of the sides is 6² + 4² + 6² + 6² = 36 + 16 + 36 + 36 = 124. Correct.

Sum of squares of diagonals is (WY)^2 + (XZ)^2 = (a + b)^2 + (2c)^2.

Expanding this gives a² + 2ab + b² + 4c². Correct.

Then, substituting a² = 36 - c² and b² = 16 - c²:

Total becomes (36 - c²) + (16 - c²) + 2ab + 4c² = 52 - 2c² + 2ab + 4c² = 52 + 2c² + 2ab. Correct.

So 52 + 2c² + 2ab = 124 → 2c² + 2ab = 72 → c² + ab = 36.

Now, from equation (1): a² = 36 - c² → a = sqrt(36 - c²)

From equation (2): b² = 16 - c² → b = sqrt(16 - c²)

So, ab = sqrt{(36 - c²)(16 - c²)}.

But from equation (3): ab = 36 - c².

So:

sqrt{(36 - c²)(16 - c²)} = 36 - c²

Square both sides:

(36 - c²)(16 - c²) = (36 - c²)^2

As before, this leads to 16 - c² = 36 - c² → 16 = 36, which is impossible.

This suggests that there is no real solution, which cannot be true. Hence, I must have made a fundamental error in setting up the equations.

Let me think differently. Perhaps the issue is in how I defined the variables. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place point P at the origin (0,0), since it's the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, let's assume that diagonal XZ is horizontal and WY is vertical.

Since P is the midpoint of XZ, and XP = PZ = c, then if XZ is horizontal, let's say point X is (-c, 0) and point Z is (c, 0). So P is at (0,0).

Now, diagonal WY is vertical, passing through P. Let's denote point W as (0, a) and point Y as (0, -b), since WY is divided into WP = a and PY = b. So total length of WY is a + b.

Now, let's find coordinates of all points:

W: (0, a)

X: (-c, 0)

Y: (0, -b)

Z: (c, 0)

Now, let's compute the lengths of the sides.

First, WX: distance between W(0,a) and X(-c,0):

√[(-c - 0)^2 + (0 - a)^2] = √(c² + a²) = 6.

So, c² + a² = 36 ...(1)

Next, XY: distance between X(-c, 0) and Y(0, -b):

√[(0 - (-c))^2 + (-b - 0)^2] = √(c² + b²) = 4.

So, c² + b² = 16 ...(2)

YZ: distance between Y(0,-b) and Z(c, 0):

√[(c - 0)^2 + (0 - (-b))^2] = √(c² + b²) = 4. Same as above.

ZW: distance between Z(c,0) and W(0,a):

√[(0 - c)^2 + (a - 0)^2] = √(c² + a²) = 6. Same as WX.

So these equations are consistent.

Now, we need to find WP, which is the length from W(0,a) to P(0,0), which is simply a. So our target is to find a.

From equations (1) and (2):

From (1): a² = 36 - c²

From (2): b² = 16 - c²

Now, we need to find a value for a. But we have two equations and three variables (a, b, c). How to resolve this?

We need another equation. Let's think about the coordinates of the points. Since the kite is determined by these points, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, in this coordinate setup, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the sides are defined. But perhaps there's another constraint from the fact that the kite is closed, or from the slopes of the sides?

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of all points, perhaps we can ensure that the sides are correctly formed. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular and one is bisected. Wait, in this setup, XZ is bisected by WY, which is true since P is the midpoint of XZ. So this is satisfied.

But we still need to find a relation between a and b.

Let me recall that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the axis of symmetry (WY) is not bisected. So, in this case, the length of WY is a + b, and since it's not bisected, a and b are arbitrary except for the constraints from the side lengths.

But how to find a?

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the other diagonal XZ is 2c, and the area of the kite can also be expressed as (d1*d2)/2 = ((a + b)*(2c))/2 = c(a + b). Also, the area can be calculated as the sum of the areas of the four triangles.

But without knowing the area, this might not help. However, perhaps we can use the coordinates to calculate the area another way?

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of all points, we can use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the kite.

Let me try that. The coordinates are:

W(0, a), X(-c, 0), Y(0, -b), Z(c, 0).

Applying shoelace formula:

List the coordinates in order: W(0,a), X(-c,0), Y(0,-b), Z(c,0), back to W(0,a).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0)(0) + (-c)(-b) + (0)(0) + (c)(a) = 0 + cb + 0 + ca = c(a + b)

Compute sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(a)(-c) + (0)(0) + (-b)(c) + (0)(0) = -ac + 0 - bc + 0 = -ac - bc

Area = |sum1 - sum2| / 2 = |c(a + b) - (-ac - bc)| / 2 = |c(a + b) + ac + bc| / 2 = |2ac + 2bc| / 2 = |ac + bc| = c(a + b). Which matches the previous expression for area.

But this doesn't provide new information.

However, we also know that in this coordinate system, the sides are defined by the distances, giving us equations (1) and (2). Still, we need another relation.

Wait, but in this setup, the kite is defined, and there's no additional constraints. So it seems like there are infinitely many solutions depending on c. But the problem asks for WP, which is a, and the answer choices suggest it's a fixed number. This implies that there's an implicit assumption or additional constraint I missed.

Wait, going back to the original problem statement, there's a predicate: RightAngle(Angle(X,Z,Y)). Let me interpret this. Angle(X,Z,Y) is the angle at point Z between points X, Z, Y. So, this is angle XZY. 

In our coordinate system, point Z is at (c, 0), point X is at (-c, 0), and point Y is at (0, -b). So, angle at Z between XZ and YZ.

Vector ZX is from Z to X: (-c - c, 0 - 0) = (-2c, 0)

Vector ZY is from Z to Y: (0 - c, -b - 0) = (-c, -b)

The angle between vectors ZX and ZY is 90 degrees. Wait, but the predicate says it's a right angle. So, angle XZY is a right angle.

Wait, but in our current setup, this angle is at Z between XZ and YZ. Let me check if this angle is a right angle.

Vectors ZX = X - Z = (-c - c, 0 - 0) = (-2c, 0)

Vector ZY = Y - Z = (0 - c, -b - 0) = (-c, -b)

The dot product of ZX and ZY should be zero if the angle is 90 degrees.

Dot product: (-2c)(-c) + (0)(-b) = 2c² + 0 = 2c².

For the angle to be 90 degrees, the dot product must be zero. But 2c² = 0 implies c = 0, which would collapse the diagonal XZ to a single point, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests a contradiction, indicating an error in the setup.

Wait, this is critical. The predicate says that Angle(X,Z,Y) is a right angle. But according to our coordinate setup, this angle is not a right angle unless c=0. This indicates a flaw in the earlier assumptions.

Let me re-express this. The predicate says RightAngle(Angle(X,Z,Y)), which means that angle at Z between X and Y is 90 degrees. In our coordinate system, this angle is at Z between XZ and YZ, which we've just shown has a dot product of 2c², which is only zero if c=0, which is invalid. Hence, there's a contradiction, suggesting an error in the setup.

What went wrong? Let me re-examine the setup. Perhaps the assignment of coordinates is incorrect.

Wait, in the problem statement, the given predicates include RightAngle(Angle(X,Z,Y)). This means that at point Z, the angle between XZ and YZ is 90 degrees. But in our current setup, this is not the case. So, there's an error in the coordinate assignments.

Let me re-examine the angle. The angle at Z between XZ and YZ. In the kite, Z is connected to X and Y. So, in the kite WXYZ, the edges at Z are ZW and ZY. Wait, no: the edges at Z are ZY and ZW. Wait, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So at point Z, the edges are YZ and ZW. So, the angle at Z is between YZ and ZW, not XZ and YZ. Wait, this is a crucial mistake!

I incorrectly interpreted the angle as between XZ and YZ, but it's actually between YZ and ZW. Let me clarify:

Angle(X,Z,Y) is the angle at Z between points X, Z, Y. So, this is the angle at Z between XZ and YZ. Wait, but in the kite, the edges at Z are YZ and ZW. So, the angle at Z is between YZ and ZW, not between XZ and YZ. Hence, my previous calculation was wrong. 

Let me correct this. The angle at Z between XZ and YZ is not part of the kite's internal angles. Wait, but the problem states that this angle is a right angle. So, this is a separate condition. Let me recalculate this angle.

Point Z is connected to X and Y. Wait, no. In the kite WXYZ, the edges are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, at point Z, the edges are YZ and ZW. So, the angle at Z is between YZ and ZW. But the predicate says Angle(X,Z,Y) is a right angle, which is the angle at Z between XZ and YZ. So, this is not one of the internal angles of the kite, but rather an external angle or a different configuration.

Wait, but how can there be a segment XZ? In the kite WXYZ, X is connected to Z via the diagonal XZ, which is part of the diagonals. So, at point Z, there are two segments: YZ (edge of the kite) and XZ (di
