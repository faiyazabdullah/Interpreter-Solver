MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have a rhombus ABCD. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB equals BC equals CD equals DA. The problem states that each of these sides has length 6. Also, there are points E where the diagonals AC and BD intersect. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, but wait, here they mention that the angles at E are right angles. Wait, the predicates say RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)). So that confirms that the diagonals intersect at right angles. 

Also, there are some angle bisectors mentioned. The diagonal AC bisects angles DAB and BCD, and diagonal BD bisects angles ABC and ADC. Hmm. Since it's a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. 

The question asks for the measure of angle ACD. Let me visualize the rhombus. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So if diagonal AC bisects angle DAB, then angle DAB is split into two equal parts by AC. Similarly, BD bisects angle ABC. 

But first, let me note down all given info. All sides are 6 units. Diagonals intersect at E, forming right angles. The angles at E are right angles, so AE perpendicular to BE, etc. 

Now, the problem says m∠DAB = 2. Wait, that seems very small. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps the original problem had degrees, but here maybe it's radians? Wait, no—probably the problem meant degrees. But 2 degrees would make the rhombus almost a straight line. That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe there's a misread. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the user wrote "m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6". Wait, that part is confusing. Let me check again.

Wait, the original problem says: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠D A B = 2, m ∠A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠A C D." Hmm, maybe there was a formatting issue. Maybe it's supposed to be m∠DAB = 2°, and CB = 6? Because CB is a side, which is already given as 6 in the predicates. Wait, the initial predicates state that all sides are 6. So CB is 6. Then maybe the problem is mistyped, and the actual given angle measures are different. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had m∠DAB = 60°, and another angle? Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. For example, maybe it's supposed to be m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = something else. But since the user input has "m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and C B = 6", maybe there's confusion in the way it's presented. Perhaps the intended meaning is that m∠DAB = 60°, and CB = 6 (which is redundant because all sides are 6). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese or another language, and the translation led to errors. Given that the answer options are A.45, B.60, C.90, D.180, which are common angles in rhombus problems. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me assume that maybe the angle DAB is 60°, which is a standard angle in rhombus problems. 

Assuming that there was a typo, and the angle DAB is 60°, then proceeding. Let me proceed under that assumption. Otherwise, if the angle is 2°, then the rest would not make sense. 

So assuming that m∠DAB = 60°, which is a typical angle in a rhombus. Now, since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 60°, the adjacent angle is 120°, and so on. 

Let me sketch the rhombus. Let me label the vertices A, B, C, D in order. So AB is connected to BC, etc. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. 

Since the diagonals bisect the angles, and they intersect at right angles. 

Given that angle DAB is 60°, then the diagonal AC bisects angle DAB into two 30° angles. Similarly, the diagonal BD bisects angle ABC, which is 120°, into two 60° angles. 

Now, the question is asking for m∠ACD. Let me identify angle ACD. Point A, point C, point D. So angle at point C between points A, C, D. 

Wait, angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D. So that would be angle DCB? Wait, no. Let me think. 

In the rhombus ABCD, the vertices are ordered such that AB is adjacent to BC, etc. So the order is A connected to B connected to C connected to D connected to A. So the angle at point C is angle BCD. Wait, but angle ACD would be at point C between points A, C, D. Wait, but point D is connected to C. So angle at C between D and A. Wait, that's angle ACD. Let me imagine the rhombus. At vertex C, the sides are CB and CD. But angle ACD would be formed by connecting A to C and D to C. So that's the angle between CA and CD. 

Alternatively, since diagonals intersect at E, which divides the diagonals into halves. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me consider triangle ACD. Wait, but I need to find angle at C. 

Alternatively, since diagonals in a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let me compute the lengths of the diagonals. 

In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then each half of the diagonals forms legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse equal to the side of the rhombus. 

Given that the sides are 6, so for each half-diagonal, (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = 6^2. Also, the angles of the rhombus relate to the diagonals. For example, if one angle is θ, then tan(θ/2) = (d1/2)/(d2/2) = d1/d2. 

But since we know one angle is 60°, let's say angle DAB is 60°, then tan(30°) = (d1)/d2. Wait, because angle DAB is split into two by diagonal AC. So the half-angle is 30°, and tan(30°) = (opposite/adjacent) = (half of diagonal BD)/(half of diagonal AC). 

Wait, more precisely, in a rhombus, the diagonals divide the angles into two equal parts. So if angle DAB is 60°, then each half is 30°, and the diagonals form a right triangle with legs (d1/2) and (d2/2), and hypotenuse 6. 

Moreover, the diagonals are related to the angles. For example, if θ is one of the angles of the rhombus, then the diagonals satisfy:

d1 = 2 * s * sin(θ/2)

d2 = 2 * s * cos(θ/2)

Wait, no, actually, the formula depends on which angle. Let me recall that for a rhombus with side length s and angles θ and 180°−θ, the lengths of the diagonals p and q are given by:

p = 2s * sin(θ/2)

q = 2s * cos(θ/2)

Wait, or maybe the other way around. Let me think. Suppose θ is one of the acute angles. Then, splitting it into two angles of θ/2. The diagonals can be found using trigonometry. 

For example, considering triangle ABD, which is formed by two sides of the rhombus and a diagonal. Wait, but maybe better to use the law of cosines. 

Alternatively, the diagonals can be calculated as follows. Let’s denote the diagonals as AC and BD. 

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, each half of the diagonals forms a right triangle with the side of the rhombus. 

So, for example, if angle DAB is θ, then the diagonals AC and BD intersect at E, and triangle AEB is a right triangle with legs (AC/2) and (BD/2), and hypotenuse AB=6. 

Moreover, angle EAB is θ/2. Therefore, tan(theta/2) = (BD/2)/(AC/2) => tan(theta/2) = BD / AC. 

So if theta is 60°, then tan(30°) = BD / AC. 

We also know that in a rhombus, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of the side length. 

That is, (AC² + BD²)/4 = s² → AC² + BD² = 4s². 

Since s=6, AC² + BD² = 4*36 = 144. 

Additionally, from the tangent ratio: BD = AC * tan(theta/2). 

Substituting, BD = AC * tan(30°) = AC*(1/√3). 

Therefore:

AC² + (AC² / 3) = 144 → (4/3)AC² = 144 → AC² = 144*(3/4) = 108 → AC = sqrt(108) = 6*sqrt(3). 

Then BD = (6*sqrt(3))*(1/√3) )= 6. 

So diagonals are AC = 6√3 and BD = 6. 

Now, the question is to find m∠ACD. 

Let me focus on triangle ACD. Points A, C, D. Wait, but angle at C is angle ACD. Let me consider triangle ACD. 

But point E is the intersection of diagonals. Since diagonals bisect each other, so CE is half of AC. Since AC is 6√3, then CE = 3√3. Similarly, DE is half of BD, which is 3. 

Now, angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D. To find this angle, maybe consider triangle CDE or some other triangle. 

Alternatively, since diagonals are perpendicular, and we know coordinates of points. Maybe coordinate geometry could help. Let me assign coordinates to the rhombus. 

Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since diagonals intersect at E, which is midpoint of both diagonals. Let me suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD. 

Given that AC is 6√3, and BD is 6. Since diagonals are perpendicular, we can set up coordinates accordingly. 

Let me take point E as origin (0,0). Then, since AC is along x-axis, and BD along y-axis. 

Coordinates:

- Point E is (0, 0).

- Since AC is 6√3, then point A is (-3√3, 0) and point C is (3√3, 0).

- BD is 6, so point B is (0, 3) and point D is (0, -3). Wait, but need to ensure that the sides are length 6. 

Wait, let me verify. Coordinates:

Points A(-3√3, 0), B(0, 3), C(3√3, 0), D(0, -3). 

Check distance AB: from (-3√3, 0) to (0, 3):

Distance squared = (3√3)^2 + (3)^2 = 27 + 9 = 36 → distance is 6. Correct. 

Similarly, BC: from (0,3) to (3√3, 0): same calculation, gives 6. 

Thus, this satisfies the rhombus with sides of length 6. 

Now, angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D. 

Point C is at (3√3, 0). 

Point D is at (0, -3). 

Point A is at (-3√3, 0). 

So vectors from C to A and from C to D. 

Vector CA: A - C = (-3√3 - 3√3, 0 - 0) = (-6√3, 0). 

Vector CD: D - C = (0 - 3√3, -3 - 0) = (-3√3, -3). 

Now, the angle between vectors CA and CD is angle ACD. 

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (CA · CD) / (|CA| |CD|)

First compute the dot product:

CA · CD = (-6√3)(-3√3) + (0)(-3) = 18*3 + 0 = 54. 

|CA| is the magnitude of vector CA: sqrt[ (-6√3)^2 + 0^2 ] = sqrt(36*3) = 6√3. 

|CD| is magnitude of vector CD: sqrt[ (-3√3)^2 + (-3)^2 ] = sqrt(27 + 9) = sqrt(36) = 6. 

Thus, cos(theta) = 54 / (6√3 * 6) = 54 / (36√3) = (3/2)/√3 = (3)/(2√3) = √3/2. 

Therefore, theta = arccos(√3/2) = 30°. 

Wait, but this contradicts the answer options given. Wait, the answer options are A.45, B.60, C.90, D.180. But according to this calculation, angle ACD is 30°, which isn't listed. Hmm. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe my assumption about the angle DAB being 60° was incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

Original problem said: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠D A B = 2, m ∠A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠A C D."

Ah! There's ambiguity in the problem statement. It might mean that m∠DAB = 2°, and CB = 6 (which is redundant as all sides are 6). However, if angle DAB is 2°, then the rest would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = ...? Or maybe there's a misprint, and instead of "m ∠DAB = 2" it should be "m ∠DAB = 60°", and "CB = 6" is just confirming the side length. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem originally had m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = something else, but due to formatting issues, it became unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the angle is 60°, leading to the calculation above resulting in 30°, which is not among the options. This suggests that my assumption about the angle being 60° is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle DAB is 90°, making the rhombus a square. But then all angles are 90°, and angle ACD would be 45°, which is option A. But why would that be? 

Wait, let me think again. If angle DAB is 90°, then the rhombus is a square. In that case, diagonals are equal and intersect at 90°, and angle ACD would be 45°, since in a square, the diagonals bisect the angles, creating 45° angles. 

But how does this fit with the given data? The problem mentions that CB = 6, which is consistent with a square. But the initial problem statement says m∠DAB = 2. Which is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angle ADC, not DAB. Let me check the original problem again. 

"In rhombus A B C D, m ∠D A B = 2, m ∠A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠A C D."

It might be that the problem has a typo and it should read m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = ?, or something like that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = x, but this is pure speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the original problem had m∠DAB = 60°, and the answer is 30°, but since 30° is not in the options, there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, going back to the earlier calculation: if angle DAB is 60°, then angle ACD comes out as 30°, but this is not an option. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

Perhaps I made an error in calculating the angle ACD. Let me recheck. 

Vectors from point C: CA is from C to A: A is (-3√3, 0), C is (3√3, 0). So vector CA is A - C = (-6√3, 0). Vector CD is D - C = (0 - 3√3, -3 - 0) = (-3√3, -3). 

Dot product is (-6√3)(-3√3) + (0)(-3) = 18*3 = 54. 

|CA| is 6√3, |CD| is sqrt( ( -3√3 )^2 + (-3)^2 ) = sqrt(27+9)=sqrt(36)=6. 

So cos(theta)=54/(6√3 * 6) = 54/(36√3) = 3/(2√3) = √3/2. 

Which corresponds to 30°, yes. So angle ACD is 30°, but that's not an option. 

Hmm. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or my assumptions are wrong. 

Alternative approach: Let's suppose that the given angle is 90°, making the rhombus a square. Then, diagonals are equal, and angle ACD is 45°, which is option A. But why would the problem mention angle DAB = 2? That still doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle DAB is 60°, and the answer is 30°, but since that's not an option, maybe I need to reconsider. 

Wait, let's look back at the given predicates. The problem includes several angle bisector conditions. 

The diagonals AC and BD bisect the angles. So angle DAB is bisected by AC, and angle ABC is bisected by BD. 

If angle DAB is 2x, then each bisected angle is x. Also, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary, angle ABC = 180° - 2x. 

But the problem states that m∠DAB = 2. Assuming this is in degrees, then angle DAB = 2°, making angle ABC = 178°. Then, the diagonal AC bisects angle DAB into 1° each, and diagonal BD bisects angle ABC into 89° each. 

This seems extremely unusual, but let's proceed. 

Using this, the diagonals would have certain lengths. Using the earlier formula, tan(angle/2) = (other diagonal)/this diagonal. 

Let me define angle DAB = 2°, so half-angle is 1°. 

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. 

From the formula: tan(theta/2) = (BD/2)/(AC/2) = BD/AC. 

So tan(1°) = BD/AC. 

Also, AC² + BD² = 4s² = 4*36 = 144. 

Let me denote BD = AC * tan(1°). 

Substitute into equation: AC² + (AC² * tan²(1°)) = 144 → AC² (1 + tan²(1°)) = 144. 

But 1 + tan²(x) = sec²(x), so AC² * sec²(1°) = 144 → AC² = 144 * cos²(1°). Thus AC = 12 cos(1°). 

Then BD = AC * tan(1°) = 12 cos(1°) * tan(1°) = 12 sin(1°). 

Now, to find angle ACD. Let's try to calculate it using coordinates again. 

Place the rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at E. Assume E is origin. 

AC = 12 cos(1°), so half-length is 6 cos(1°). BD = 12 sin(1°), so half-length is 6 sin(1°). 

Coordinates:

- A: (-6 cos(1°), 0)

- C: (6 cos(1°), 0)

- B: (0, 6 sin(1°))

- D: (0, -6 sin(1°))

Now, vector CA is A - C = (-12 cos(1°), 0). 

Vector CD is D - C = (0 - 6 cos(1°), -6 sin(1°) - 0) = (-6 cos(1°), -6 sin(1°)). 

Dot product of CA and CD: (-12 cos(1°))*(-6 cos(1°)) + 0*(-6 sin(1°)) = 72 cos²(1°). 

Magnitude of CA: 12 cos(1°). 

Magnitude of CD: sqrt[ (-6 cos(1°))^2 + (-6 sin(1°))^2 ] = sqrt(36 cos²(1°) + 36 sin²(1°)) = 6 sqrt(cos²(1°)+sin²(1°)) = 6. 

So cos(theta) = [72 cos²(1°)] / [12 cos(1°) * 6] = [72 cos²(1°)] / [72 cos(1°)] = cos(1°). 

Thus, theta = 1°, which is the angle between CA and CD. 

But this would mean angle ACD is 1°, which is not among the options. 

Clearly, this suggests that the original problem likely had a typo, and the angle DAB is 60°, leading to angle ACD being 30°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for angle AED or another angle. 

Wait, let me double-check the question: "Find m ∠ACD." 

In the rhombus, angle ACD is at point C, between points A, C, D. 

Wait, in the coordinate system I used earlier with angle DAB = 60°, angle ACD came out as 30°, which is not in the options. But maybe I made a mistake in identifying the angle. 

Wait, let me think differently. In the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle ACD is part of triangle ACD. 

Alternatively, since angle at C in the rhombus is angle BCD. Wait, angle BCD is the angle at point C between points B, C, D. But angle ACD is the angle at point C between points A, C, D. 

Wait, in the rhombus, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AB is adjacent to BC, etc. So at point C, the sides are CB and CD. The angle at C is angle BCD. But angle ACD is formed by connecting A to C. So it's the angle between CA and CD. 

In the earlier coordinate system, with angle DAB = 60°, the angle ACD came out as 30°, but this is not an option. 

However, the answer options are A.45, B.60, C.90, D.180. 

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Maybe it's asking for angle ADC? Let me check. 

No, the question specifically says angle ACD. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the angle bisector conditions. Let me revisit the given predicates. 

The problem states that line AC bisects angle DAB and angle BCD. Similarly, line BD bisects angles ABC and ADC. 

Wait, if angle DAB is 60°, then its bisector AC splits it into two 30° angles. Then, angle BCD is equal to angle DAB, since in a rhombus opposite angles are equal. So angle BCD is also 60°, and AC bisects it into two 30° angles. 

Now, in triangle ACD, we have angle at C is angle ACD, which we computed as 30°, but since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for angle ACD in terms of the other angles. Let me think: in the rhombus, the diagonals intersect at E, forming right angles. 

In triangle AEC, which is a right triangle, since diagonals are perpendicular. 

AE is half of AC, and EC is half of AC? No, AC is one diagonal. Wait, in the earlier example with angle DAB = 60°, AC was 6√3, so AE is half of that, 3√3. And BE is half of BD, which was 3. 

In triangle AEC, right-angled at E, with legs 3√3 and 3. So angle at C (angle ACE) would be arctan(3 / (3√3)) = arctan(1/√3) = 30°. 

Wait, angle ACE is 30°, which is part of angle ACD. What is angle ACD? 

In the rhombus, angle at C is angle BCD = 60°, which is split by diagonal AC into two angles: angle BCA and angle ACD. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

At point C, the angle is angle BCD. The diagonal AC splits this angle into two parts: angle BCA and angle ACD. Since AC bisects angle BCD, each part is 30°, so angle ACD is 30°. 

But this still gives 30°, which is not an option. 

Unless there's a miscalculation here. Let me confirm. 

If angle BCD is 60°, and AC bisects it, then angle ACD is 30°, yes. But since this is not an option, there must be an error. 

Looking back at the original problem statement, it says "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6." Maybe "m∠ADC and C B = 6" means that m∠ADC = 6 and CB = 6? But CB is already 6. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant m∠DAB = 2 and m∠ADC = 6? If that's the case, then let's see. 

In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle DAB = 2°, then angle ADC = 180° - 2° = 178°. But this would make the other angles too large, and the calculation would be complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that m∠DAB = 60°, and m∠ADC = 60°, making it a rectangle? No, because in a rhombus, if all angles are 60°, it's not possible. 

Wait, unless it's a square, but then all angles are 90°. 

I'm stuck. Given that the answer options are A.45, B.60, C.90, D.180, and assuming that there was a typo in the problem, and the intended angle DAB is 60°, then angle ACD is 30°, which is not an option. Alternatively, if the angle DAB is 90°, then angle ACD is 45°, which is option A. 

Maybe the original problem had angle DAB = 90°, making it a square, and angle ACD = 45°. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for angle AED or another angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves the fact that angle ACD is formed by the diagonal and a side, and uses the bisector condition. 

Wait, the predicates include that line AC bisects angle DAB and angle BCD. So angle BCD is bisected by AC. Since angle BCD is equal to angle DAB, which is given as 2° (assuming it's 2°), then angle BCD is 2°, and AC bisects it into 1° each. But this leads to angle ACD being 1°, which is not an option. 

This is very confusing. Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, but the presence of answer choices, I'll try to think differently. 

Let me assume that the problem has a typo and the angle DAB is 60°, and the answer is 30°, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for angle ACD, which is part of triangle ACD. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect the angles. So angle ACD is half of angle BCD, which is equal to angle DAB. If angle DAB is 60°, then angle BCD is 60°, and angle ACD is half of that, 30°. Still not matching. 

But if angle DAB is 60°, then angle ADC is 120°, and since diagonal BD bisects angle ADC, then angle ADC is split into two 60° angles. So at point D, angle ADC is 120°, and BD bisects it into 60° each. 

But how does this relate to angle ACD? 

Wait, maybe using triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have sides AD = 6, DC = 6, and AC = 6√3. So triangle ADC is an isoceles triangle with sides 6, 6, and 6√3. Wait, but 6, 6, and 6√3: the Law of Cosines would give:

(6√3)^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 - 2*6*6*cos(angle ACD). 

Wait, no, in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle ACD. Let me write it properly. 

In triangle ADC, sides:

AD = 6, DC = 6, and AC = 6√3. 

Applying the Law of Cosines:

(AC)^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 - 2*AD*DC*cos(angle ADC). 

Wait, no, angle at C is angle ACD. So:

AD^2 = AC^2 + DC^2 - 2*AC*DC*cos(angle ACD). 

Wait, let me get this right. 

Let me denote angle at C as θ = angle ACD. 

Then, applying Law of Cosines on triangle ADC:

AD² = AC² + DC² - 2 * AC * DC * cos(θ). 

Plugging in numbers:

6² = (6√3)^2 + 6² - 2*(6√3)*6*cos(θ). 

Calculating:

36 = 108 + 36 - 72√3 cosθ 

36 = 144 - 72√3 cosθ 

Rearranging: 72√3 cosθ = 144 - 36 = 108 

=> cosθ = 108 / (72√3) = (3/2)/√3 = √3/2 

Thus, θ = 30°, as before. 

Again, this suggests angle ACD is 30°, not in options. 

Given that, and knowing that the answer must be among A-D, I suspect the original problem had a different angle. Let's assume that the angle DAB is 90°, making it a square. Then, angle ACD would be 45°, option A. 

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 60°, and there's a miscalculation, maybe I missed a property. 

Wait, perhaps the question refers to angle ACD as the angle between AC and CD, which in the case of a rhombus with angle DAB = 60°, is 30°, but the options don't include it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for angle CAD, which would be 30°, but no. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in radians, and 30° is π/6, but that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, the problem may have had m∠DAB = 60°, and the answer is 30°, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. 

Given the available options, and assuming that the intended angle was 90°, making angle ACD 45°, which is option A, I'll choose A. 

But this is speculative. Another possibility is that the angle DAB is 60°, and the answer is 30°, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is B.60°, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for angle ADC, which would be 120°, but that's not an option either. 

Given the uncertainty, and considering that in a rhombus with angle DAB = 60°, the diagonals create 30° angles, and if the problem mistakenly lists the options without including 30°, but the closest is 45°, I'll go with A.45°. 

But this is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for angle AED, which is 90°, but that's option C. 

Given the lack of clarity, I'll assume that the correct answer is A.45°, and select that.
