<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the figure they describe. Let me start by listing out all the given elements.

We have points A, B, C, D, and E. The quadrilateral is defined by A, B, C, D, so that means AB, BC, CD, DA are sides forming a four-sided figure. Then there are two triangles mentioned: Triangle(B, C, E) and Triangle(C, E, D). So point E is connected to B and C for one triangle, and to C and D for another. Also, lines are specified between these points: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(B,E), Line(C,E). 

Angles listed include several. The measures given are for Angle(1)=58°, Angle(2)=47°, Angle(3)=26°, and we need to find Angle(9). Wait, but the problem mentions Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3), but doesn't specify which ones correspond to which parts. However, looking at the list of angles provided in the predicates:

The angles mentioned are:
- Angle(A, B, C)
- Angle(B, C, D)
- Angle(C, D, A)
- Angle(D, A, B)
- Angle(B, E, C)
- Angle(C, E, B)
- Angle(C, E, D)
- Angle(E, D, C)
- Angle(E, C, B)
- Angle(E, B, C)
- Angle(E, C, D)
- Angle(C, D, E)
- Angle(D, E, C)

Wait, but the user also lists Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), 58), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 47), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)), 26). So Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3) refer to three specific angles among those listed. But without knowing which ones, maybe we can infer based on the structure.

Looking at the figure: Quadrilateral ABCD with triangles BCE and CDE. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Quadrilateral ABCD has vertices A, B, C, D connected in order. Points E is connected to B and C (forming triangle BEC) and to C and D (forming triangle CED). So E is inside the quadrilateral? Or outside?

Assuming E is a point connected to B and C, making triangle BEC, and connected to C and D, making triangle CED. So E could be inside the quadrilateral. Now, the angles given: Let me see which angles are given.

The problem states m∠1=58, m∠2=47, m∠3=26. Need to find ∠9. But first, need to map these angles to the given ones.

Let me check the angles mentioned in the predicates:

From the list, the angles are:

1. Angle(A,B,C): This would be angle at B in triangle ABC? Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between segments XY and YZ. So Angle(A,B,C) is angle at B formed by points A-B-C. Similarly for others.

So, given that, let's note each angle:

- Angle(A,B,C): At B, between A-B and B-C. That's part of the quadrilateral ABCD. Since AB is connected to B, and BC is connected to B. So this angle is one of the internal angles of the quadrilateral at vertex B. Wait, but in a quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is 360 degrees. However, if there are other structures like triangles attached, perhaps some angles are split.

But given that there are triangles involving E, maybe some of these angles are parts of those triangles.

Now, the given measures:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 58, MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 47, MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 26. We need to find ∠9. Assuming that the numbering corresponds to certain angles in the diagram. But since the problem didn't specify which angles are 1, 2, 3, we need to deduce based on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the labels 1, 2, 3 refer to specific angles in the figure. For example, Angle(1) could be Angle(B,C,D), which is the angle at C between B-C-D. Wait, but that's part of the quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe it's an angle in one of the triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are part of the triangles. Let me think about the triangles involved.

First triangle is Triangle(B, C, E). So angles here would be at B, C, E. The angles in this triangle would be Angle(B,C,E), Angle(C,E,B), and Angle(E,B,C). Similarly, Triangle(C, E, D) has angles at C, E, D: Angle(C,E,D), Angle(E,D,C), Angle(D,C,E).

Also, the quadrilateral ABCD has angles at each corner: A, B, C, D.

Additionally, there are angles at point E, such as Angle(B,E,C), Angle(C,E,D), etc.

Given that, maybe the given angles 1, 2, 3 are among these. For instance, suppose Angle(1) is Angle(B,C,D) which is part of the quadrilateral. But wait, Angle(B,C,D) would be the angle at C between B-C and C-D. Which is part of the quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe it's an angle in one of the triangles.

Alternatively, considering that in the quadrilateral ABCD, the angles at B, C, D, A. Let me consider that. Suppose the given angles are some combination of those.

But given that the problem includes triangles connected via E, perhaps the angles 1, 2, 3 are angles in the triangles. For example, Angle(B,E,C) could be one of them.

Alternatively, maybe Angle(1) is Angle(B,C,D), which is part of the quadrilateral. Let me try to assign numbers.

Let me look back at the list of angles given in the predicates. There are many angles, but the problem gives three measures: 58, 47, 26. These likely correspond to three specific angles in the figure. Since there are multiple angles, but the problem asks for ∠9, which suggests that there are nine angles in total, numbered 1 through 9. However, the exact correspondence isn't given, so I need to deduce based on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are part of the triangles. Let me think about the triangles.

For Triangle(B,C,E): angles at B, C, E. Let's say one of these angles is 58, another 47, another 26. Similarly for Triangle(C,E,D). Also, the quadrilateral ABCD may contribute angles.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are part of the triangles. For example, if Angle(1) is Angle(B,E,C) which is part of triangle BEC, and Angle(2) is Angle(C,E,B), etc. But without knowing which is which, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are angles in the triangles. Let me consider that. Let's assume that Angle(1) is part of triangle BEC, Angle(2) is part of triangle CED, and Angle(3) is something else.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I should look for relationships between angles. For example, in triangle BEC, the sum of angles is 180°. Similarly for triangle CED.

Suppose that in triangle BEC, angles are given as 58°, 47°, and 26°. Wait, adding those up: 58 + 47 + 26 = 131°, which is less than 180°, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the given angles are not all in the same triangle.

Alternatively, maybe two angles are in one triangle and one in another. Let me think again.

Another approach: Since the problem involves a quadrilateral and two triangles connected via E, perhaps the angles given relate to the triangles and the quadrilateral. Let me consider the entire figure.

Quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals or connections to E. Let me think of ABCD as a quadrilateral with E being a point connected to B and C, creating triangles BEC and CED. Let me imagine that E is inside the quadrilateral.

Then, the angles at point E would be part of triangles BEC and CED. For example, in triangle BEC, angles at E, B, C. In triangle CED, angles at E, C, D.

Additionally, the angles at points B, C, D, A of the quadrilateral.

Moreover, the angles around point E would add up to 360° if E is inside the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, if E is outside, but probably inside.

Let me attempt to find relations.

Suppose that the given angles are parts of the triangles. For example, Angle(B,E,C) is one of the angles. Let me denote some variables.

Let me label the angles given:

Assume Angle(1) = 58°, Angle(2) = 47°, Angle(3) = 26°. Let me think which angles these could be.

Possibly, Angle(1) is the angle at B in triangle BEC (Angle(B,E,C)? No, Angle(B,E,C) is at E. Wait, Angle(B,E,C) is at E between B-E and E-C. So that's an angle in triangle BEC. Similarly, Angle(C,E,B) is at B, and Angle(E,B,C) is at C. So in triangle BEC, the three angles are at B, E, C.

Similarly, in triangle CED, angles at C, E, D.

So if we can identify which angles are given, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

Let me assume that Angle(1) is Angle(B,E,C) = 58°, Angle(2) is Angle(C,E,B) = 47°, and Angle(3) is Angle(C,E,D) = 26°. Wait, but Angle(C,E,D) is in triangle CED. Let me check if that adds up.

Wait, in triangle BEC, angles at B, E, C. Let's say Angle at E (Angle(B,E,C)) is 58°, Angle at B (Angle(C,E,B)) is 47°, then Angle at C in triangle BEC would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. But that's just an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe Angle(1) is Angle(B,E,C) = 58°, Angle(2) is Angle(C,E,D) = 47°, and Angle(3) is Angle(E,B,C) = 26°, but need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(1) is part of the quadrilateral. For example, the angle at B in the quadrilateral, which is Angle(A,B,C) = 58°, and similarly other angles.

This is getting confusing without knowing which angles correspond to 1, 2, 3. But perhaps there's a way to deduce based on the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are angles of the triangles, and using that, we can find other angles in the figure, leading to finding ∠9.

Wait, the problem says to find the measure of ∠9. So perhaps the numbering of the angles is sequential. For example, the first angle given is ∠1, second is ∠2, third is ∠3, and ∠9 is another one. Without seeing the actual diagram, it's hard, but maybe there's a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe ∠9 is an external angle or an angle formed by intersecting lines.

Alternatively, since the problem includes a quadrilateral and triangles, maybe ∠9 is an angle in one of the triangles or the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, let me think about the sum of angles around point E. If E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles around E would be the sum of angles from triangles BEC and CED. For example, the angles at E in triangle BEC and CED. Suppose that in triangle BEC, angle at E is x, and in triangle CED, angle at E is y. Then x + y plus any other angles at E would make up the full 360° around E. But unless there are more triangles meeting at E, but according to the given, only two triangles: BEC and CED. So if E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles at E from triangles BEC and CED would be adjacent, adding up to some value.

But how does that help us?

Alternatively, let's focus on the triangles.

Take triangle BEC: its angles are at B, E, C. Let me call them α, β, γ respectively.

Take triangle CED: angles at C, E, D: let's say δ, ε, ζ.

Now, the angles at B, C, D in the quadrilateral would be influenced by these triangles.

For example, the angle at B in the quadrilateral (Angle(A,B,C)) would be composed of the angle from triangle BEC at B and possibly another angle. Wait, if E is connected to B, then the angle at B in the quadrilateral (which is between A-B and B-C) might be split into two angles: one between A-B and B-E, and another between B-E and B-C. Unless E lies on the side BC, but according to the given lines, E is connected to B and C, so E is not on BC, but rather forms a triangle with B and C. Hence, the angle at B in the quadrilateral is divided into two angles by segment BE.

Similarly for angle at C in the quadrilateral (Angle(B,C,D)): this angle is split into two angles by EC: one between B-C and C-E, and another between C-E and C-D.

Therefore, the angles at B and C in the quadrilateral can be expressed as sums of angles from the triangles.

Let me formalize this.

At point B:

Original angle of quadrilateral at B is Angle(A,B,C) = angle between AB and BC. With segment BE added, this angle is split into two parts: angle between AB and BE (let's call this θ), and angle between BE and BC (call this φ). So Angle(A,B,C) = θ + φ.

Similarly, at point C: original angle of quadrilateral at C is Angle(B,C,D). This is split by segment EC into angle between BC and CE (say ψ) and angle between CE and CD (say χ). So Angle(B,C,D) = ψ + χ.

Now, in triangle BEC, the angles are at B, E, C. Those angles are:

At B: φ (as above)
At C: ψ (as above)
At E: let's call this angle μ.

Thus, in triangle BEC, φ + ψ + μ = 180°.

Similarly, in triangle CED, angles at C, E, D. At C, the angle is χ (from earlier), at E, let's say ν, and at D, let's say λ. So χ + ν + λ = 180°.

Now, the angles of the quadrilateral ABCD:

At B: θ + φ = Angle(A,B,C)
At C: ψ + χ = Angle(B,C,D)
At D: ??
At A: ?? 

But we don't know the angles at D and A yet. However, the sum of all internal angles of a quadrilateral is 360°. So:

Angle at A + Angle at B + Angle at C + Angle at D = 360°.

But we might not have enough info directly. However, if we can express some of these angles in terms of other variables.

But how do the given angles fit into this?

The problem gives three measures: 58°, 47°, 26°, corresponding to Angles 1, 2, 3. Let's assume that these are angles from the triangles or the quadrilateral.

But without knowing which ones, it's tricky. However, let's try to make educated guesses.

Suppose that Angle(1) is the angle at E in triangle BEC, which is μ = 58°, Angle(2) is the angle at E in triangle CED, ν = 47°, and Angle(3) is one of the angles in the triangles, say φ = 26°. Then, we can proceed.

But this is speculative. Let me try to work with that.

Assume:

μ = 58° (Angle at E in triangle BEC)
ν = 47° (Angle at E in triangle CED)
φ = 26° (angle at B in triangle BEC, i.e., angle between BE and BC)

From triangle BEC: φ + ψ + μ = 180°
=> 26° + ψ + 58° = 180°
=> ψ = 180 - 26 - 58 = 96°

So ψ = 96°, which is the angle at C in triangle BEC, which is the angle between BC and CE.

Now, moving to triangle CED. Let's assume that Angle(3) is χ (the angle at C between CE and CD), which is part of the quadrilateral's angle at C. So χ = 26°? Or maybe another angle?

Wait, if we take Angle(3) as χ, then in triangle CED: χ + ν + λ = 180°
=> 26° + 47° + λ = 180°
=> λ = 180 - 26 - 47 = 107°, which is the angle at D in triangle CED.

Now, the angle at C in the quadrilateral is ψ + χ = 96° + 26° = 122°.

Now, what about the angle at D in the quadrilateral? It's composed of angle between CD and DE, and maybe another angle? Wait, the quadrilateral has side CD connected to D, and point E is connected to D via line ED. So the angle at D in the quadrilateral (Angle(C,D,A)) is between CD and DA. But with segment ED connecting to D, this angle at D is split into two parts: between CD and DE (which is λ = 107°, from triangle CED) and between DE and DA. Wait, but we don't know the latter. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D in the quadrilateral is composed of angle between CD and DE (λ = 107°) and another angle between DE and DA. But without knowing that, it's difficult.

However, let's recall that the sum of angles in the quadrilateral is 360°. Let's assume we have:

Angle at B: θ + φ = ?
Angle at C: ψ + χ = 122°
Angle at D: ??? 
Angle at A: ???

But we need more information. Perhaps there are other angles we can derive.

Alternatively, maybe we can find angles at A and D using other information.

Wait, also, there's another triangle: Triangle(C, E, D). Earlier, we considered that angle at D is λ = 107°, but that's in triangle CED. However, the angle at D in the quadrilateral is different. Because in the quadrilateral, the angle at D is between CD and DA. If there's a connection from D to E, then the angle at D in the quadrilateral is split into two parts: between CD and DE (which is λ = 107°), and between DE and DA. Let's call the latter angle ξ. Thus, the angle at D in the quadrilateral is λ + ξ. But we don't know ξ yet.

Similarly, at point A, the angle of the quadrilateral (Angle(D,A,B)) is between DA and AB. If there are other connections, but according to the given predicates, there's no mention of E connected to A, so the angle at A remains as is. 

So, sum of angles:

Angle at A + Angle at B + Angle at C + Angle at D = 360°

We know Angle at C = 122°, and need expressions for others.

But we need to find Angle at A and D. However, without more info, this seems stuck.

Wait, but perhaps there are other angles that can be determined. For example, the angles at E. Since E is connected to B, C, D. Are there other angles at E? Like, if there are more lines connected to E, but according to the given, only lines EB, EC, and ED. So around point E, there are three angles: one from triangle BEC (μ = 58°), one from triangle CED (ν = 47°), and maybe another angle? Wait, unless there are other triangles. But according to the given, only triangles BEC and CED. So around point E, the angles would be μ (from BEC), ν (from CED), and possibly another angle if there's another line from E. But according to the given, only lines EB, EC, ED. So around E, the angles are μ, ν, and the remaining angle between ED and EA if there was a line EA, but there's no such line mentioned. Wait, unless there's another connection. The given lines are AB, BC, CD, DA, BE, CE. So E is connected to B, C, and D. So the angles around E are:

Between BE and EC: angle μ (from triangle BEC)
Between EC and ED: angle ν (from triangle CED)
And between ED and EB? Wait, but that depends on the configuration. If E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles around E would be μ, ν, and another angle. Wait, but in reality, the sum of angles around a point is 360°. So if E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles around E would be:

Angle between BE and EC: μ = 58°
Angle between EC and ED: ν = 47°
Angle between ED and EB: let's say η
Then μ + ν + η = 360°? No, because around a point, the sum of angles is 360°. So μ + ν + η = 360°? No, actually, if there are three angles around E, they should add up to 360°. Wait, but if E is connected to B, C, D, then there are three angles at E: between BE and EC, between EC and ED, and between ED and EB. So those three angles add up to 360°. So:

μ + ν + η = 360°, where η is the angle between ED and EB. 

But earlier, we assumed μ = 58° and ν = 47°, so η = 360 - 58 - 47 = 255°. That seems very large, implying that E is outside the quadrilateral, or the configuration is unusual. But that might be possible.

But this seems problematic. Let me re-express:

If E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles around E would be:

Angle between BE and EC: μ = 58°
Angle between EC and ED: ν = 47°
Angle between ED and EB: η = ?

Sum: μ + ν + η = 360° → η = 360 - 58 - 47 = 255°, which is impossible because that would mean the angle between ED and EB is reflex (>180°), suggesting that E is outside the quadrilateral. 

Hmm, this suggests that our initial assumptions about which angles are which might be incorrect. Perhaps the given angles are not μ and ν, but other angles.

Let me reconsider. Suppose instead that the given angles are not the angles at E, but other angles.

For example, Angle(1) could be Angle(B,C,D), which is part of the quadrilateral at C. Suppose Angle(B,C,D) = 58°, Angle(2) is Angle(C,D,A) = 47°, and Angle(3) is Angle(D,A,B) = 26°. Then, the fourth angle at B would be 360 - (58+47+26) = 360 - 131 = 229°, which is again impossible. So that's not possible either.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are angles within the triangles. Let me try again.

Let me consider that in triangle BEC, one of its angles is 58°, another is 47°, and another is 26°, but that would sum to 131°, which is not possible. So that can't be.

Wait, but maybe the given angles are not all in the same triangle. For example, one angle in triangle BEC, one in triangle CED, and one elsewhere. Let me try:

Suppose Angle(1) = 58° is the angle at B in triangle BEC (Angle(C,E,B) = 58°), Angle(2) = 47° is the angle at C in triangle CED (Angle(C,E,D) = 47°), and Angle(3) = 26° is the angle at D in triangle CED (Angle(D,E,C) = 26°). 

Wait, in triangle CED, the angles are at C, E, D. So if Angle(C,E,D) = 47°, Angle(D,E,C) = 26°, then the third angle at E would be 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. 

Then, in triangle BEC, suppose Angle(C,E,B) = 58° (at B), and Angle(B,E,C) = ?, and Angle(E,B,C) = ?. 

But without knowing which angles are which, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are parts of the quadrilateral. Let me assume that the angle at B in the quadrilateral is 58°, the angle at C is 47°, and the angle at D is 26°. Then, the fourth angle at A would be 360 - (58+47+26) = 229°, which is again impossible.

This suggests that my current assumptions are wrong. Perhaps the given angles are not angles of the quadrilateral but parts of the triangles. Let me try another approach.

Since the problem mentions Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3), and asks for Angle(9), and the answer choices are numerical, perhaps there's a way to calculate ∠9 using the given angles through some geometric relationships.

Let me think about the triangles. Suppose that in triangle BEC, one angle is 58°, another is 47°, and the third is something. Similarly for other triangles. But as before, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

Wait, if we assume that two of the given angles are in one triangle and one in another. For example, suppose Angle(1) and Angle(2) are angles in triangle BEC, and Angle(3) is in triangle CED.

Let me try:

In triangle BEC, suppose Angle(B,E,C) = 58°, and Angle(C,E,B) = 47°, then the third angle at C would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. 

Then, in triangle CED, if Angle(3) = 26° is one of its angles, say Angle(C,E,D) = 26°, then the other angles would be... Let's say Angle(C,E,D) = 26°, and Angle(E,D,C) = ?. Let me assume that Angle(E,D,C) is some value, say x. Then the third angle at E would be 180 - 26 - x.

But without knowing x, it's still ambiguous.

However, if we can relate these angles to other parts of the figure. For example, the angle at C in the quadrilateral is made up of the angle from triangle BEC (75°) and the angle from triangle CED (26°)? No, because in triangle BEC, the angle at C is 75°, and in triangle CED, the angle at C is part of the quadrilateral's angle. Wait, no— in triangle CED, the angle at C is between EC and CD, which is part of the quadrilateral's angle at C. So if in triangle CED, the angle at C is, say, y, then the total angle at C in the quadrilateral would be the angle from triangle BEC (75°) plus y. 

But we don't know y.

Alternatively, if the angle at C in the quadrilateral is composed of two angles: one from triangle BEC (ψ = 75°) and one from triangle CED (say z), so total angle at C is 75 + z. Similarly, angle at B is composed of angle from triangle BEC (φ) and another angle.

But without knowing these values, it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps there's another approach. Let me recall that the sum of all angles around a point is 360°. If E is inside the quadrilateral, then the angles around E are:

- Angle between BE and EC: let's call this α
- Angle between EC and ED: β
- Angle between ED and EB: γ

These three angles must sum to 360°: α + β + γ = 360°.

If we can find α, β, γ, then perhaps we can find some relationship.

But how?

If α is an angle in triangle BEC, β in triangle CED, and γ is another angle.

But without knowing which angles are which, it's still unclear.

Wait, let's go back to the initial problem statement. The user provided a list of angles with their measures. Let me try to map them.

The given angles in the predicates are:

- Angle(A,B,C): at B
- Angle(B,C,D): at C
- Angle(C,D,A): at D
- Angle(D,A,B): at A
- Angle(B,E,C): at E
- Angle(C,E,B): at B
- Angle(C,E,D): at E
- Angle(E,D,C): at D
- Angle(E,C,B): at C
- Angle(E,B,C): at B
- Angle(E,C,D): at C
- Angle(C,D,E): at E

Wait, this is quite a lot. Let me try to count the unique angles:

1. Angle at B: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(C,E,B), Angle(E,B,C)
2. Angle at C: Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(E,C,B), Angle(E,C,D)
Wait, some duplicates here. Let me clarify:

Each angle is uniquely identified by its vertex. For example, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X-Y-Z.

So, for example:

- Angle(A,B,C): at B between A-B-C
- Angle(B,C,D): at C between B-C-D
- Angle(C,D,A): at D between C-D-A
- Angle(D,A,B): at A between D-A-B
- Angle(B,E,C): at E between B-E-C
- Angle(C,E,B): at B between C-E-B
- Angle(C,E,D): at E between C-E-D
- Angle(E,D,C): at D between E-D-C
- Angle(E,C,B): at C between E-C-B
- Angle(E,B,C): at B between E-B-C
- Angle(E,C,D): at C between E-C-D
- Angle(C,D,E): at E between C-D-E

Wait, some of these are repeats. For example, Angle(E,C,B) is at C between E-C-B, which is the same as Angle(C,E,B) at B. No, no. Wait, Angle(E,C,B) is at C between E-C-B. So it's the angle at C between E and B. Whereas Angle(C,E,B) is at B between C-E-B. So they're different.

So, the unique angles are:

- At B: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(C,E,B), Angle(E,B,C)
- At C: Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(E,C,B), Angle(E,C,D)
Wait, Angle(E,C,D) is at C between E-C-D, Angle(C,E,D) is at E between C-E-D. So unique angles at C: Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A), Angle(C,E,D), Angle(E,C,B), Angle(E,C,D)?

No, Angle(C,E,D) is at E, not at C. So at C, the angles are:

- Angle(B,C,D): at C between B-C-D
- Angle(C,D,A): at D between C-D-A (wait no, Angle(C,D,A) is at D)
Wait, Angle(C,D,A) is at D between C-D-A.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all angles properly:

List of all angles mentioned in the predicates:

1. Angle(A,B,C) – at B
2. Angle(B,C,D) – at C
3. Angle(C,D,A) – at D
4. Angle(D,A,B) – at A
5. Angle(B,E,C) – at E
6. Angle(C,E,B) – at B
7. Angle(C,E,D) – at E
8. Angle(E,D,C) – at D
9. Angle(E,C,B) – at C
10. Angle(E,B,C) – at B
11. Angle(E,C,D) – at C
12. Angle(C,D,E) – at E

So, these are the 12 angles mentioned. Now, the problem gives three measures: Angle(1)=58°, Angle(2)=47°, Angle(3)=26°. We need to find Angle(9). Assuming that these are among the above angles, but which ones?

Let me try to associate the given measures with these angles.

Suppose Angle(1) is Angle(B,C,D) at C, which is part of the quadrilateral. Angle(2) is Angle(C,D,A) at D, and Angle(3) is Angle(D,A,B) at A. Then, the sum of these three angles would be part of the quadrilateral's angles. But the sum of all four angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. So if we have three angles, we could find the fourth.

But this requires assuming which angles are given. Let me try this scenario.

Assume:
- Angle(1) = Angle(B,C,D) = 58°
- Angle(2) = Angle(C,D,A) = 47°
- Angle(3) = Angle(D,A,B) = 26°

Then, the fourth angle at B would be 360 - (58 + 47 + 26) = 360 - 131 = 229°, which is impossible for a convex quadrilateral. Hence, this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all from the quadrilateral. Maybe some are from the triangles.

Let me try another approach. Suppose that Angle(1) is Angle(B,E,C) at E, which is 58°, Angle(2) is Angle(C,E,D) at E, which is 47°, and Angle(3) is Angle(E,C,B) at C, which is 26°.

Then, in triangle BEC, we have Angle at E: 58°, Angle at C: 26°, so the third angle at B would be 180 - 58 - 26 = 96°. 

In triangle CED, we have Angle at E: 47°, and if Angle at C is something, let's say x. Then, the third angle at D would be 180 - 47 - x.

Now, the angle at C in the quadrilateral is Angle(B,C,D), which is composed of Angle at C in triangle BEC (26°) and Angle at C in triangle CED (x). So Angle(B,C,D) = 26 + x.

Similarly, the angle at B in the quadrilateral is Angle(A,B,C), which is composed of Angle at B in triangle BEC (96°) and possibly another angle if there's a segment from B to another point, but there's no such segment mentioned. So Angle(A,B,C) = 96°, assuming no other splits.

Then, the angle at D in the quadrilateral is Angle(C,D,A), which is composed of Angle at D in triangle CED (which is 180 - 47 - x) and possibly another angle. But since there's no other segment from D, it's just that angle.

So, sum of angles in quadrilateral:

Angle at A (unknown) + Angle at B (96°) + Angle at C (26 + x) + Angle at D (180 - 47 - x) = 360°

Simplify:

Let me denote Angle at A as y.

So:

y + 96 + 26 + x + 180 - 47 - x = 360

Combine terms:

y + 96 + 26 + 180 - 47 = 360

Calculate constants:

96 + 26 = 122; 122 + 180 = 302; 302 - 47 = 255

So y + 255 = 360 → y = 105°

So Angle at A is 105°.

But how does this help us find ∠9?

The problem asks for ∠9. Assuming that ∠9 is one of the angles in the list, but we need to know which one. Let's assume that ∠9 is Angle(E,C,B) which we already used as 26°, but that's given as Angle(3). Or perhaps ∠9 is another angle.

Alternatively, maybe ∠9 is the angle at E in triangle CED, which is 47°, but that's given as Angle(2). Or perhaps it's the angle at A, which is 105°, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, maybe ∠9 is the angle at B in the quadrilateral, which is 96°, but that's not among the options either.

Alternatively, maybe ∠9 is the angle at E in triangle CED, which is 47°, but that's given as Angle(2).

This approach isn't yielding the desired result. Let me try another scenario.

Let me assume that Angle(1) is Angle(C,E,B) at B, which is 58°, Angle(2) is Angle(E,C,B) at C, which is 47°, and Angle(3) is Angle(C,E,D) at E, which is 26°.

Then, in triangle BEC, we have Angle at B: 58°, Angle at C: 47°, so the third angle at E is 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°.

In triangle CED, Angle at E is 26°, so the other angles are at C and D. Let's say Angle at C is x and Angle at D is y. So x + y + 26 = 180 → x + y = 154°.

Now, the angle at C in the quadrilateral is Angle(B,C,D), which is made up of the angle from triangle BEC (47°) and the angle from triangle CED (x). So Angle(B,C,D) = 47 + x.

The angle at D in the quadrilateral is Angle(C,D,A), which is made up of the angle from triangle CED (y) and possibly another angle. If there's no other segment from D, it's just y.

The angle at B in the quadrilateral is Angle(A,B,C), which is made up of the angle from triangle BEC (58°) and possibly another angle. If there's no other segment from B, it's just 58°.

So, sum of angles in quadrilateral:

Angle at A + 58 + (47 + x) + y = 360

But x + y = 154, so substitute:

Angle at A + 58 + 47 + 154 = 360

Total: 58 + 47 = 105; 105 + 154 = 259

So Angle at A + 259 = 360 → Angle at A = 101°

Now, what about ∠9? If ∠9 is the angle at E in triangle BEC, which is 75°, or the angle at E in triangle CED, which is 26°, or another angle. But none of these match the options.

Alternatively, if ∠9 is the angle at E in triangle CED, which is 26°, but that's given as Angle(3). Or maybe it's the angle at D in triangle CED, which is y = 154 - x, but we don't know x.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to consider that the given angles are not all from the triangles but from the quadrilateral and triangles combined.

Let me try one last time. Assume that the given angles are:

Angle(1) = 58° is Angle(B,C,D) at C in the quadrilateral.

Angle(2) = 47° is Angle(C,D,A) at D in the quadrilateral.

Angle(3) = 26° is Angle(D,A,B) at A in the quadrilateral.

Then, the fourth angle at B is 360 - (58 + 47 + 26) = 229°, which is impossible, so discard.

Alternatively, maybe one of the given angles is from a triangle. For example, Angle(1) = 58° is Angle(B,E,C) at E in triangle BEC. Angle(2) = 47° is Angle(C,E,D) at E in triangle CED. Angle(3) = 26° is Angle(E,C,B) at C in triangle BEC.

Then, in triangle BEC: Angle at E = 58°, Angle at C = 26°, so Angle at B = 180 - 58 - 26 = 96°.

In triangle CED: Angle at E = 47°, Angle at C = let's say x, Angle at D = y, so x + y = 180 - 47 = 133°.

Now, the angle at C in the quadrilateral is Angle(B,C,D) = Angle from triangle BEC at C (26°) + Angle from triangle CED at C (x) = 26 + x.

The angle at D in the quadrilateral is Angle(C,D,A) = Angle from triangle CED at D (y).

The angle at B in the quadrilateral is Angle(A,B,C) = Angle from triangle BEC at B (96°).

So sum of angles in quadrilateral:

Angle at A + 96 + (26 + x) + y = 360

But x + y = 133, so substituting:

Angle at A + 96 + 26 + 133 = 360 → Angle at A + 255 = 360 → Angle at A = 105°.

Now, what about ∠9? If ∠9 is the angle at A, which is 105°, but that's not an option. The options are A. 39, B. 47, C. 49, D. 58.

Alternatively, if ∠9 is x or y, but we don't know their values. However, if we consider that in triangle CED, x + y = 133°, and if there's another relationship, like the angle at D in the quadrilateral is y, and if there's a relationship between y and other angles.

But without more info, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that the angle at D in the quadrilateral is y, and if there's a triangle involving D and other points, but I don't see it.

Wait, the angle at D in the quadrilateral is y, which is part of triangle CED. If there's a line from D to A, which is part of the quadrilateral, and if there's a relationship between y and the angle at D in the quadrilateral. But without more information, it's still unclear.

But let's think about the angles around point E. The angles at E are:

- From triangle BEC: 58° (Angle(B,E,C))
- From triangle CED: 47° (Angle(C,E,D))
- And possibly another angle if there's a third line from E, but there isn't. So the sum of these two angles is 58 + 47 = 105°, leaving 360 - 105 = 255°, which would be the angle between ED and EB, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the angle at E
