<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle ABCD, and there are some points and lines mentioned. The question is about finding the measure of angle 3, given that angle 2 is 40 degrees. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each corner has 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Now, there's a point E involved. The lines mentioned include AE, BE, CE, DE, and also diagonals AC and BD. Wait, because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But maybe that's not directly helpful yet.

Looking at the length equalities: Length of AE is 1, EC is 7, BE is 6, ED is 4. Hmm, so AE + EC would be AD? Because if E is somewhere along the diagonal AC? Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Wait, but here AE is 1 and EC is 7, so total AC would be 8 units. Then BD should also be 8 units. But how does point E relate here?

Also, there are angles given. Measure of angle AEB is 40 degrees. And angle BED equals angle CEA, and angle DEC equals angle AEB. So angle DEC is 40 degrees as well. Also, angle BED equals angle CEA. Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Rectangle ABCD with points A, B, C, D. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at center O, but maybe E isn't the intersection point. Instead, E is some point connected to these lines. Given that lines AE, BE, CE, DE are present. So E is connected to all four corners? Or perhaps E is inside the rectangle?

Wait, the lines given are Line(A,E), Line(B,E), Line(C,E), Line(D,E). So E is connected to all four vertices. That suggests E is inside the rectangle, connected to each vertex. So E is a point inside the rectangle such that lines from E to each corner exist.

But given the lengths: AE=1, BE=6, CE=7, DE=4. Also, angles at E: angle AEB is 40°, angle BED equals angle CEA, angle DEC equals angle AEB (which is 40°).

So, angle at E between A and B is 40°, angle between B and D is equal to angle between C and A, and angle between D and C is equal to angle AEB (so 40°). So need to find angle 3, which I assume refers to one of these angles. Wait, the question says m∠2 = 40. Find m∠3. Maybe ∠2 and ∠3 refer to certain angles in the diagram.

Alternatively, maybe the labels of angles 2 and 3 are referring to specific angles formed by the lines. For example, angle AEB is angle 2 (since it's given as 40°) and angle 3 could be another angle like angle BED or something else. Need to clarify.

But since the problem mentions angle 2 and angle 3, perhaps they are specific angles in the diagram. Let's consider that angle AEB is angle 2 (given as 40°), and angle 3 could be another angle like angle BED or angle CED or something else. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is part of triangle involving E.

Another thought: since ABCD is a rectangle, coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, suppose AB is horizontal and AD is vertical. Let’s denote coordinates:

Let’s say A is (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, B would be (a,0), D would be (0,b), and C would be (a,b). The diagonals AC and BD would have equations y = (b/a)x and y = (-b/a)(x - a) respectively. But point E is connected to all four points, so maybe we can use coordinate geometry here.

Given that AE = 1, BE = 6, CE = 7, DE = 4. Let me think. Suppose E has coordinates (x,y). Then:

Distance from A(0,0) to E(x,y): sqrt(x² + y²) = 1 → x² + y² = 1.

Distance from B(a,0) to E(x,y): sqrt((x - a)² + y²) = 6 → (x - a)² + y² = 36.

Distance from C(a,b) to E(x,y): sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²) = 7 → (x - a)² + (y - b)^2 = 49.

Distance from D(0,b) to E(x,y): sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2) = 4 → x² + (y - b)^2 = 16.

Now, we have four equations:

1. x² + y² = 1
2. (x - a)² + y² = 36
3. (x - a)² + (y - b)^2 = 49
4. x² + (y - b)^2 = 16

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 minus Equation 1: (x - a)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) = 36 - 1 → expand (x² - 2ax + a²) - x² = 35 → -2ax + a² = 35 → -2ax = 35 - a² → x = (a² - 35)/(2a)

Similarly, subtract equation 4 from equation 3:

Equation 3 minus Equation 4: [(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2] - [x² + (y - b)^2] = 49 - 16 → (x - a)^2 - x² = 33 → expanding x² - 2ax + a² - x² = -2ax + a² = 33 → same as before, -2ax + a² = 33.

But earlier, from equation 2 - 1, we had -2ax + a² = 35. Therefore, equating the two expressions:

From equation 2-1: -2ax + a² = 35

From equation 3-4: -2ax + a² = 33

This implies 35 = 33, which is impossible. Contradiction! So my assumption must be wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait—maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me check again.

Equation 3 minus equation 4: [(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2] - [x^2 + (y-b)^2] = 49 - 16 → (x-a)^2 - x^2 = 33 → expand (x² - 2ax + a²) - x² = -2ax + a² = 33. Correct.

Equation 2 minus equation 1: (x-a)^2 + y² - x² - y² = (x-a)^2 - x² = -2ax + a² = 35. So yes, same left side, different right sides. Which gives 35 = 33. Not possible. Hence contradiction. What does this mean?

Hmm. This suggests that my initial assumption of coordinates might be invalid, or perhaps there's an error in interpreting the setup. Alternatively, maybe E is not inside the rectangle? Or maybe the lines aren't connecting E to all four corners? Wait, the problem states:

"Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(A,C), Line(B,D)" — those are the sides and diagonals of the rectangle. Then there are Lines(A,E), Line(B,E), Line(C,E), Line(D,E). So E is connected to each vertex. So my coordinate approach assumes that E is inside the rectangle, but according to the equations, that leads to inconsistency. Therefore, perhaps E is outside the rectangle?

Alternatively, maybe my coordinate system needs adjustment. Let me think again. Perhaps the rectangle isn't aligned with axes? Or maybe E is not inside. Let me reconsider.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle has specific dimensions. Let me see if I can find relations between a and b.

From equation 1: x² + y² = 1

From equation 4: x² + (y - b)^2 = 16 → subtract equation 1: (y - b)^2 - y² = 15 → expanding y² - 2by + b² - y² = -2by + b² = 15 → -2by + b² = 15 → 2by = b² -15 → y = (b² -15)/(2b)

Similarly, from equation 2: (x - a)^2 + y² = 36. From equation 1: x² + y² = 1 → substituting into equation 2: (x - a)^2 + (1 - x²) = 36 → expand (x² - 2ax + a²) + 1 - x² = -2ax + a² +1 = 36 → -2ax = 35 -a² → x = (a² -35)/(2a)

Earlier, we found that from equation 3-4: -2ax + a² = 33. So combining with previous expression for x:

From above, x = (a² -35)/(2a). Plug into -2ax + a² = ?

-2a * [(a² -35)/(2a)] + a² = -(a² -35) + a² = -a² +35 +a² = 35. But earlier, from equation 3-4, this equals 33. So 35 = 33, which is impossible. Hence contradiction. So this suggests that our assumptions are conflicting. 

What does this imply? It suggests that either the given lengths are inconsistent with the rectangle's structure, or there's an error in the way we're modeling the problem. Alternatively, maybe E is not connected to all four points in the way I assumed. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Rectangle(A,B,C,D)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,E,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,A)))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,B)))"

So, the lines mentioned are the sides and diagonals of the rectangle, plus lines from E to each vertex. So E is connected to all four vertices. However, the lengths given may not fit into a standard rectangle unless E is placed in a particular way.

Perhaps instead of assuming E is inside, it's outside? Let me consider that possibility. For instance, maybe E is outside the rectangle, leading to different distances.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle's sides are not aligned with the coordinate axes. Let me try another approach without coordinates.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, diagonals AC and BD are equal and bisect each other. However, point E is not necessarily the intersection point of the diagonals. Instead, E is a point connected to all four vertices with given lengths.

We know that AE=1, BE=6, CE=7, DE=4. So, considering the entire set of distances from E to the rectangle's vertices, perhaps we can apply the British flag theorem? Wait, the British flag theorem states that for any point E in the plane of a rectangle ABCD, the sum of the squares of the distances from E to two opposite corners equals the sum of the squares of the distances to the other two opposite corners. 

So, according to the theorem: EA² + EC² = EB² + ED².

Let me check with the given values:

EA=1 → EA² = 1

EC=7 → EC² = 49

EB=6 → EB² = 36

ED=4 → ED² = 16

Then EA² + EC² = 1 + 49 = 50

EB² + ED² = 36 + 16 = 52

These are not equal. 50 ≠ 52. So the British flag theorem doesn't hold here. Which means that either the theorem doesn't apply (but it should for any point in the plane), or there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe E is not in the plane of the rectangle? No, that's impossible. Wait, but the British flag theorem requires that ABCD is a rectangle. So the fact that EA² + EC² ≠ EB² + ED² suggests that there's a contradiction. Therefore, either the given data is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.

Wait, but the problem is presented as solvable. So perhaps my application of the theorem is incorrect? Let me double-check the British flag theorem. Yes, it states that for any point E in the plane of rectangle ABCD, EA² + EC² = EB² + ED². So with the given numbers, this equality fails. Therefore, the given lengths cannot coexist in a rectangle. This seems contradictory. 

But since the problem is given, there must be a way to reconcile this. Perhaps the issue is that E is not in the plane of the rectangle? No, that's not possible. Or maybe E is not connected to all four vertices? Wait, the problem says Line(A,E), Line(B,E), Line(C,E), Line(D,E)—so E is connected to all four vertices. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is degenerate? No, a rectangle cannot be degenerate. 

Hmm, this is perplexing. Perhaps there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the given lengths are not Euclidean distances? No, the problem uses standard geometric terms. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not straight-line distances, but something else? Unlikely. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves three-dimensional space? But the mention of a rectangle and angles suggests planar geometry. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not in Euclidean geometry? But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths are not all from E to the rectangle's vertices. Wait, the problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 1)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 7)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), 6)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4)"

So AE = 1, EC = 7, BE = 6, ED = 4. So E is connected to A, B, C, D. So the British flag theorem applies, implying EA² + EC² = EB² + ED². But according to the given values, 1+49=50 vs 36+16=52. So discrepancy. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem's data. But since the problem is posed, perhaps there's a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the lines are not straight lines? Like, Line(A,E) could be a broken line? No, in geometry, Line(A,E) usually denotes a straight line segment. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about a rectangle but another shape? But the first predicate says Rectangle(A,B,C,D). 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the ones I think. For example, maybe Angle(A,B,D) is a right angle, which is consistent with a rectangle. 

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)) predicate. In a rectangle, angle at B between A and D would be a right angle. Because in rectangle ABCD, angle at B is between A-B-C, but angle ABD would be... Let me visualize. Point A, B, D. In rectangle ABCD, points A, B, C, D in order. So AB is adjacent to BC, CD, DA. So angle at B between A and D would be angle ABD. Wait, but in a rectangle, AB is horizontal, BD is a diagonal. So angle between AB and BD at B. Is that a right angle? No. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)). So angle at B between A and D. So in a rectangle, AB is one side, BD is a diagonal. So the angle between AB and BD at B is not necessarily a right angle. Wait, but the predicate says it is. So that imposes a condition that in this rectangle, angle ABD is a right angle. Which would mean that BD is perpendicular to AB. But in a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to AD, not BD. So this suggests that the rectangle has a specific property where diagonal BD is perpendicular to AB. Which would only happen if AB is zero length, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

Wait, this indicates another inconsistency. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is perpendicular to AD. But if angle ABD is a right angle, then AB is perpendicular to BD. So BD would be perpendicular to AB. But in a rectangle, BD is a diagonal. So for BD to be perpendicular to AB, the rectangle must be a square? Let me think. 

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. For BD to be perpendicular to AB, the slope of BD times slope of AB must be -1. Let's take coordinates again. Let me place A at (0,0), B at (a,0), D at (0,b), so C is at (a,b). The diagonal BD connects B(a,0) to D(0,b). Its slope is (b-0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. AB is horizontal, slope 0. For BD to be perpendicular to AB, the product of slopes should be -1. But slope of AB is 0, so product is 0. Hence, not possible unless AB is undefined, which it isn't. Therefore, angle ABD cannot be a right angle in a general rectangle. Thus, the given predicate RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)) introduces another inconsistency. 

This suggests that the problem contains conflicting conditions. But since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have misunderstood the setup. Let me try to reinterpret the predicates.

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)): perhaps it's not the angle at B, but at D? Wait, the syntax is Angle(A,B,D), which typically means the angle at B between points A and D. So angle ABD. So that's the angle at B between BA and BD. As discussed, this cannot be a right angle in a rectangle unless specific conditions are met.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not convex? No, rectangles are always convex. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is folded or something? No, that's not standard. 

At this point, it seems the problem has conflicting conditions, making it unsolvable under normal geometric assumptions. However, since the problem is given, perhaps I need to proceed despite these inconsistencies, focusing on the angle measures given.

The question asks for m∠3, given that m∠2 = 40. Let me focus on the angles. We know that angle AEB is 40°, and angle BED equals angle CEA, and angle DEC equals angle AEB (also 40°). 

Assuming that angle 2 is angle AEB (40°), and angle 3 is one of the others. Let me try to analyze the angles around point E.

Around point E, there are several angles. Let's consider the full circle around E. The angles at E would add up to 360 degrees. Let's list the angles:

- Angle AEB = 40°
- Angle BEC ?
- Angle CED = 40° (as per the last predicate)
- Angle DEA ?

But also, the second predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(B,E,D)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,A)). So angle BED equals angle CEA. Let me denote angle BED as x, and angle CEA as x.

Additionally, angle DEC is equal to angle AEB, which is 40°. So angle DEC = 40°.

Now, let's consider the sum of angles around E. Assuming E is inside the rectangle, the angles around E would be:

- Between EA and EB: 40°
- Between EB and EC: let's call this y
- Between EC and ED: 40°
- Between ED and EA: z

But also, angle BED is x, which is the angle between BE and ED. Similarly, angle CEA is x, which is angle between CE and EA.

Wait, perhaps I need to draw this carefully. Let me think about the connections:

E is connected to A, B, C, D. So from E, there are four segments: EA, EB, EC, ED. These form four angles around E: 

1. Between EA and EB: angle AEB = 40°
2. Between EB and EC: angle BEC
3. Between EC and ED: angle CED = 40°
4. Between ED and EA: angle DEA

But also, the given that angle BED (between BE and ED) equals angle CEA (between CE and EA). So angle BED is x, and angle CEA is x. How do these relate to the other angles?

Let me try to express the angles:

Around point E, the sum of all angles is 360°. So:

angle AEB + angle BEC + angle CED + angle DEA = 360°

But angle AEB is 40°, angle CED is 40°, so:

40 + angle BEC + 40 + angle DEA = 360 → angle BEC + angle DEA = 280°

Also, angle BED is x, which is the angle between BE and ED. So angle BED is part of angle BEC and angle DEA? Let me think. 

Alternatively, if we look at triangle BEC and other triangles. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

But we also have that angle BED = angle CEA = x. Let's consider triangle BEC. In triangle BEC, we know BE = 6, EC = 7, but we don't know BC. Wait, BC is a side of the rectangle. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is equal to AD, and AD is a side. But we don't know its length.

However, from earlier, there was a contradiction in the British flag theorem, suggesting that the given lengths might not correspond to a valid rectangle. But maybe we can ignore that and proceed with the angles.

Let me think about triangle AEB: we know AE = 1, BE = 6, and angle AEB = 40°. Using the Law of Cosines, we can find AB. Wait, AB is a side of the rectangle. Let me calculate AB.

In triangle AEB:

AB² = AE² + BE² - 2*AE*BE*cos(angle AEB)

So AB² = 1² + 6² - 2*1*6*cos(40°)

Calculate that:

AB² = 1 + 36 - 12*cos(40°) ≈ 37 - 12*(0.7660) ≈ 37 - 9.192 ≈ 27.808

Thus AB ≈ sqrt(27.808) ≈ 5.273 units.

Similarly, in triangle CED: angle CED = 40°, CE = 7, DE = 4. So CD² = CE² + DE² - 2*CE*DE*cos(angle CED)

CD² = 7² + 4² - 2*7*4*cos(40°)

CD² = 49 + 16 - 56*cos(40°) ≈ 65 - 56*0.7660 ≈ 65 - 43.0 ≈ 22.0

So CD ≈ sqrt(22) ≈ 4.690 units.

But in a rectangle, AB = CD. Here, AB ≈ 5.273 and CD ≈ 4.690, which are unequal. This contradicts the rectangle's property that opposite sides are equal. Hence, another inconsistency.

This suggests that the given lengths are incompatible with the rectangle's properties. However, since the problem exists, perhaps we are meant to overlook these contradictions and focus solely on the angular relationships. 

Let me return to the angles. We have angle AEB = 40°, angle CED = 40°, angle BED = angle CEA = x. Also, from the earlier sum around point E:

angle AEB + angle BEC + angle CED + angle DEA = 360°

Which gives 40 + angle BEC + 40 + angle DEA = 360 → angle BEC + angle DEA = 280°

Now, let's look at triangle BEC. If we can find some relationship there, or triangle DEA. 

Alternatively, note that angle BED = x and angle CEA = x. Let me consider triangle BEC and triangle DEA. 

Wait, but without more information about sides or other angles, it's difficult. However, maybe using the Law of Sines in some triangles.

In triangle AEB: AE = 1, BE = 6, angle AEB = 40°. So using Law of Sines:

sin(angle EAB)/BE = sin(angle AEB)/AB

Wait, but we don't know AB. Alternatively, using Law of Cosines as before gave us AB ≈ 5.273, which conflicts with CD being ~4.69. 

But if we proceed regardless, let's assume AB is approximately 5.273. Then, in triangle AEB, angle at A is angle EAB, and angle at B is angle EBA. Let's compute them.

Using Law of Sines:

sin(angle EAB)/BE = sin(angle AEB)/AB

→ sin(angle EAB)/6 = sin(40°)/AB

→ angle EAB = arcsin[(6*sin(40°))/AB]

With AB ≈ 5.273, this becomes:

6*sin(40°)/5.273 ≈ 6*0.6428 / 5.273 ≈ 3.8568 / 5.273 ≈ 0.730. So angle EAB ≈ arcsin(0.730) ≈ 47° (approximate). 

Similarly, angle EBA = 180° - 40° - 47° ≈ 93°. But this is speculative.

But how does this help with the rest?

Alternatively, since angle CEA = x, and angle CEA is in triangle CEA. Let me consider triangle CEA: CE = 7, AE = 1, angle at E is x. Using Law of Cosines:

CA² = CE² + AE² - 2*CE*AE*cos(x)

But CA is the diagonal of the rectangle. In a rectangle, CA = sqrt(AB² + AD²). But we don't know AB or AD. 

But from earlier, AB ≈ 5.273 and CD ≈ 4.690, but CD should equal AB. So this inconsistency remains. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the given angle measures and the relationships to find the desired angle, ignoring the inconsistencies in lengths. 

Given that, let's focus on the angles. We have angle AEB = 40°, angle CED = 40°, and angle BED = angle CEA = x. Also, the sum around point E is 360°, giving angle BEC + angle DEA = 280°. 

Let me consider triangle BEC and triangle DEA. If I can find relationships between these angles. 

But without more info, it's challenging. However, perhaps there's symmetry or other angle relationships. 

Wait, the problem mentions that angle BED equals angle CEA. Let me consider those angles. 

Angle BED is the angle at E between BE and ED. Angle CEA is the angle at E between CE and EA. Are these angles supplementary or something? 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that ABCD is a rectangle, so AD is parallel to BC, and AB is parallel to DC. 

Let me imagine extending lines from E. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD || BC and AB || DC. 

Maybe considering transversal lines or something. 

Alternatively, since angle AEB = 40°, and angle DEC = 40°, and angle BED = angle CEA = x, maybe there's a way to relate these angles through the rectangle's properties. 

Let me try to consider the full 360° around E. 

Total angles around E: angle AEB (40°) + angle BEC + angle CED (40°) + angle DEA = 360°

So angle BEC + angle DEA = 280°. 

Now, angle BED is x, which is part of angle BEC and angle DEA? Let me think. 

Angle BEC is the angle at E between BE and EC. This can be split into angle BED (x) and angle CEB? Wait, no. If we consider angle BEC, it's between BE and EC. If ED is another line, then angle BEC could be related to x. 

Alternatively, if we look at triangle BEC, the sum of its angles is 180°. Let's say in triangle BEC, we have angle at E is angle BEC, angle at B is something, angle at C is something. But without knowing sides or other angles, it's hard to proceed. 

Similarly for triangle DEA. 

But maybe there's another approach. Since ABCD is a rectangle, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the midpoint. Let's call the midpoint O. But E is not necessarily O. However, if we consider vectors or coordinate geometry again, even though earlier attempts led to contradictions. 

Let me attempt once more with coordinates, accepting that there might be a miscalculation. 

Let me define the rectangle with A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,b), D(0,b). Let E(x,y). 

From earlier, we had:

1. x² + y² = 1 (AE=1)
2. (x - a)^2 + y² = 36 (BE=6)
3. (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = 49 (CE=7)
4. x² + (y - b)^2 = 16 (DE=4)

Subtracting 1 from 2: (x - a)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 36 - 1 → -2ax + a² = 35 → x = (a² - 35)/(2a)

Subtracting 4 from 3: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 - (x² + (y - b)^2) = 49 - 16 → (x - a)^2 - x² = 33 → -2ax + a² = 33

So, from 2-1: -2ax + a² = 35

From 3-4: -2ax + a² = 33

This implies 35 = 33, which is impossible. Hence, there is no solution unless a is infinite, which it isn't. 

Therefore, the problem's given conditions are contradictory, making it impossible to determine the angles. But since the problem is presented, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the lengths are not from E to the vertices, but from E to the sides? No, the predicates specify LengthOf(Line(A,E)), which is the distance between A and E. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, and E is not in the plane? But then the angles wouldn't be defined as in the problem. 

Given that I'm stuck on the contradictions in the problem's setup, perhaps I should focus on the angle relationships given, ignoring the length contradictions. 

The question asks for m∠3, given m∠2 = 40. Assume ∠2 is angle AEB = 40°, and ∠3 is one of the other angles. Let's assume ∠3 is angle CEA or angle BED, which are equal. 

Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,E,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,E,A))). So angle BED = angle CEA. And angle DEC = angle AEB = 40°. 

Let me consider the sum of angles around E. Let's denote:

- angle AEB = 40°
- angle BED = x
- angle CED = 40°
- angle DEA = y

But also, angle CEA = x. How does this relate?

Wait, angle CEA is the angle at E between C and A, which is part of angle DEA or something? 

Alternatively, if we look at the full circle around E, the angles are:

angle AEB (40°) + angle BEC + angle CED (40°) + angle DEA = 360°. 

But angle BEC is composed of angle BED (x) and angle CEB? No, angle BEC is between BE and EC. If ED is a separate line, then angle BEC could be related to x and other angles. 

Alternatively, if we consider that angle BED = x and angle CEA = x, and angle DEC = 40°, perhaps there's a way to express the remaining angles. 

Let me try to write equations. Let's assume that around point E, the angles are:

- Between EA and EB: 40°
- Between EB and ED: x (angle BED)
- Between ED and EC: 40° (angle CED)
- Between EC and EA: x (angle CEA)

Wait, but this would give total angles: 40 + x + 40 + x = 80 + 2x = 360 → 2x = 280 → x = 140°. 

But then angle BED = x = 140°, and angle CEA = 140°. But this seems large. 

But if this is the case, then angle 3 could be x, which would be 140°, but none of the options is 140. The options are A.10, B.40, C.50, D.90. So this suggests a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles around E are arranged differently. Let me think again. 

If angle AEB = 40°, angle CED = 40°, and angle BED = x, angle CEA = x. 

But how do these angles fit together? Let me imagine the four lines from E: EA, EB, EC, ED. They divide the plane into four regions. Each region has an angle at E. 

If I traverse from EA to EB to EC to ED and back to EA, the angles between consecutive lines are:

Between EA and EB: 40°
Between EB and EC: let's call this angle1
Between EC and ED: 40°
Between ED and EA: let's call this angle2

Total: 40 + angle1 + 40 + angle2 = 360 → angle1 + angle2 = 280°

Now, angle BED is the angle between BE and ED, which would be angle1 + angle2? No, depending on the arrangement. 

Wait, if you're at point E, and the lines are EA, EB, EC, ED, the angles between EB and ED would depend on the order. Let's assume the order is EA, EB, EC, ED going clockwise. Then, angle between EB and ED would be angle between EB and EC (angle1) plus angle between EC and ED (40°). So angle BED = angle1 + 40°. 

Similarly, angle CEA is the angle between CE and EA, which would be angle between CE and ED (40°) plus angle between ED and EA (angle2). So angle CEA = 40° + angle2. 

According to the given, angle BED = angle CEA → angle1 + 40 = 40 + angle2 → angle1 = angle2. 

So angle1 = angle2, and their sum is 280°, so each is 140°. 

Thus, angle1 = 140°, angle2 = 140°. 

So angle BED = angle1 + 40 = 140 + 40 = 180°? No, wait. If angle1 is between EB and EC, and angle between EC and ED is 40°, then angle BED (between EB and ED) is angle1 + 40°. 

But if angle1 is 140°, then angle BED = 140 + 40 = 180°, which would mean that points B, E, D are colinear, but that would mean ED is extension of EB, which might conflict with other given lengths. 

Alternatively, if angle1 is the angle between EB and EC, and angle2 is between ED and EA, then angle CEA is the angle between CE and EA, which would be angle between CE and ED (40°) plus angle between ED and EA (angle2). So angle CEA = 40 + angle2. 

And angle BED is angle between BE and ED, which is angle between BE and EC (angle1) plus angle between EC and ED (40°), so angle BED = angle1 + 40. 

Setting them equal: angle1 + 40 = 40 + angle2 → angle1 = angle2. 

Since angle1 + angle2 = 280°, each is 140°. 

Thus, angle BED = 140 + 40 = 180°, which implies that B, E, D are collinear, with E between B and D. But if ED = 4 and BE = 6, then BD = BE + ED = 10. But in a rectangle, the diagonal BD should satisfy BD = sqrt(AB² + AD²). But from earlier, we saw that with AE=1, BE=6, etc., there were inconsistencies. 

But assuming this scenario, where B-E-D are collinear, then angle BED is 180°, which would mean that E lies on BD. But then, if E is on BD, let's see what happens. 

If E is on BD, then BE + ED = BD. Given BE=6 and ED=4, BD = 10. In a rectangle, the diagonal BD has length sqrt(AB² + AD²). Also, from the British flag theorem, EA² + EC² = EB² + ED² → 1 + 49 = 36 + 16 → 50 = 52, which is false. So this suggests inconsistency. 

But if we ignore this, and proceed with the angle calculation, then angle BED = 180°, but the problem states that angle BED equals angle CEA. If angle CEA is also 180°, then that would mean points C, E, A are collinear, with E between C and A. But then EC + EA = CA. Given EC=7 and EA=1, CA = 8. In a rectangle, CA is the diagonal, so CA = sqrt(AB² + AD²) = 8. But from the British flag theorem, this would require EA² + EC² = 1 + 49 = 50 = EB² + ED² = 36 + 16 = 52, which still doesn't hold. 

But if we accept this, then angle CEA is 180°, which would mean E is on CA. But then, if E is on CA, and also on BD, then E is the intersection of diagonals. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so E would be the center. But then, if E is the center, then AE = EC = half of diagonal. Given AE=1 and EC=7, this would mean diagonal CA = 8, so AE=4, but given AE=1, contradiction. 

This suggests that the problem has conflicting conditions, making it impossible to determine the angles. But since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps the intended answer is based on the angle relationships without considering the length contradictions. 

Assuming that angle BED = angle CEA = x, and from the earlier derivation, x = 140°, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, if the angles around E are different. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the arrangement of angles. Let me try a different approach. 

Since angle AEB = 40°, and angle DEC = 40°, and angle BED = angle CEA = x, let's consider triangle AEB and triangle DEC. 

In triangle AEB: sides AE=1, BE=6, angle between them 40°. In triangle DEC: sides DE=4, CE=7, angle between them 40°. 

Using the Law of Cosines in both triangles:

For triangle AEB: AB² = 1² + 6² - 2*1*6*cos(40°) ≈ 1 + 36 - 12*0.766 ≈ 37 - 9.192 ≈ 27.808 → AB ≈ 5.273

For triangle DEC: DC² = 4² + 7² - 2*4*7*cos(40°) ≈ 16 + 49 - 56*0.766 ≈ 65 - 43.0 ≈ 22.0 → DC ≈ 4.690

But in a rectangle, AB = CD, so this is a contradiction. However, if we proceed, assuming AB = CD, then we can set 27.808 = 22.0, which is false. 

But if we ignore this, and focus on the angles, perhaps there's a way to find x. 

Let me consider the sum of angles around E: 360°. 

If angle AEB = 40°, angle DEC = 40°, and angle BED = angle CEA = x. Let's assume that the other two angles (between BE and EC, and between ED and EA) are y and z. 

But earlier, we found that if angle BED = x and angle CEA = x, and angle AEB = 40°, angle DEC = 40°, then the sum would involve x and other angles. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the angles at E are: 

- AEB = 40°
- BED = x
- CED = 40°
- CEA = x

But these four angles would add up to 40 + x + 40 + x = 80 + 2x = 360 → 2x = 280 → x = 140°. 

But 140° is not an option. The options are 10, 40, 50, 90. 

Wait, but maybe the angle asked is not x but another angle. Let me re-read the question: "Find m∠3." The question mentions m∠2 = 40. So likely, ∠2 is 40°, and ∠3 is another angle. 

If the angles around E are 40°, x, 40°, and x, totaling 80 + 2x = 360 → x = 140°. But since 140° is not an option, maybe there's a different interpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not all around E, but part of triangles. For example, in triangle BEC, angle at E is x, and in triangle DEA, angle at E is x. 

If I consider triangle BEC: it has sides BE=6, EC=7, and BC. Similarly, triangle DEA: DE=4, EA=1, and DA. 

But in a rectangle, BC = AD. Let me denote BC = AD = k. 

In triangle BEC: using Law of Cosines, BC² = BE² + EC² - 2*BE*EC*cos(x) → k² = 36 + 49 - 2*6*7*cos(x) → k² = 85 - 84cos(x)

In triangle DEA: DA = k, DE=4, EA=1. So DA² = DE² + EA² - 2*DE*EA*cos(angle DEA). But angle DEA is part of the angles around E. If angle DEA is part of the sum, and we have from earlier, angle DEA = 140° (if x=140°). But
