<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, AC, AD, DC. Also, there are some length equalities given. Let me list them out again:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 6x + 2)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), 8)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,C))))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), 6x + 10)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 9x - 2)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 10)

The question is to find x. The answer choices are A.3, B.4, C.6, D.7.

First, let me note that Line(A,C) is mentioned twice. Once as the sum of Line(A,D) and Line(D,C), and once as 6x +10. So maybe I can set up an equation here.

From the third predicate: LengthOf(A,C) = LengthOf(A,D) + LengthOf(D,C). But we also have another expression for LengthOf(A,C): 6x +10. And from the first predicate, LengthOf(A,D) is 6x +2, and LengthOf(D,C) is 8. So substituting these into the third equality:

6x +10 = (6x +2) + 8. Let me compute the right-hand side: 6x +2 +8 = 6x +10. Wait, so that gives 6x+10=6x+10. Which is always true. Hmm, that doesn't help us find x. That means those two expressions for LengthOf(A,C) are consistent but don't give new info. So maybe we need another equation involving x.

Looking at the other predicates. There's also the LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals 9x -2, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 10. But how do these relate? Maybe triangle ABC? Since points A, B, C form a triangle because there are lines AB, BC, and AC. So triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. We know BC is 10, AB is 9x-2, and AC is 6x+10. But wait, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides should be greater than the third. However, without knowing if it's a right triangle or something else, maybe we need more info.

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Let me check again. Are there any other equations?

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates can be considered. Suppose we assign coordinates to points to model the situation. For example, place point A at (0,0), point C somewhere along the x-axis at (c,0), then point D somewhere such that AD is 6x+2 and DC is 8. But maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, since AC is made up of AD and DC, which suggests that D lies on segment AC. Because if you have points A-D-C, then AC would be AD + DC. Therefore, D is a point on AC such that AD = 6x +2 and DC =8, making AC = AD + DC = 6x +2 +8 = 6x +10, which matches the given LengthOf(A,C) as 6x +10. So that's consistent. Therefore, D lies on segment AC.

But then, why are there lines AB, BC, BD? Wait, the given lines include AB, BC, AC, AD, DC. So points A, B, C form triangle ABC, and D is a point on AC. Then, there's line AD and DC. So D is between A and C.

Now, considering triangle ABC. We have AB = 9x -2, BC =10, and AC =6x +10. So maybe applying the triangle inequality here? Or perhaps using the Law of Cosines or something else? But unless we have angles, maybe not directly helpful.

Wait, but maybe triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. So, if we can write the triangle inequalities:

AB + BC > AC → (9x -2) + 10 > 6x +10 → 9x +8 > 6x +10 → 3x > 2 → x > 2/3. Not very helpful.

Similarly, AB + AC > BC → (9x -2) + (6x +10) >10 → 15x +8 >10 → 15x>2 → x>2/15. Also not helpful.

AC + BC > AB → (6x +10) +10 >9x -2 → 6x +20 >9x -2 → 22>3x → x <22/3 ≈7.333. So x could be up to about 7.33. Since answer options go up to 7, maybe that's a clue. But still, not enough.

But perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. The problem mentions Line(A,D) and Line(D,C), which are parts of AC. But maybe there's another relation involving point D? Like, maybe triangle ABD or CBD? Or maybe coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates to the points. Let me assume coordinates where point A is at (0,0), point C is at (6x+10, 0), since AC is length 6x+10. Then point D is located somewhere between A and C. Since AD is 6x+2, then coordinate of D would be at ((6x+2)/ (6x+10)) * AC? Wait, no. If AC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (L,0) where L =6x+10, then point D divides AC into AD =6x+2 and DC=8. Therefore, the coordinate of D would be at (AD, 0) = (6x+2, 0). Wait, but if AC is from A(0,0) to C(L,0), then D is at distance AD from A, so coordinate (AD, 0) = (6x+2, 0). Then DC is L - AD = (6x+10) - (6x+2)=8, which matches. So coordinates are fixed here.

Then, point B is connected to A and C via lines AB and BC. Given that AB has length 9x-2 and BC has length 10. So coordinates of B are unknown, but we can attempt to model this.

Let me denote coordinates:

A = (0, 0)
C = (6x +10, 0)
D = (6x +2, 0)

Now, point B is connected to A and C. Let me denote coordinates of B as (p, q). Then, AB distance is sqrt((p-0)^2 + (q-0)^2) = sqrt(p² + q²) = 9x -2.

Also, BC distance is sqrt((p - (6x +10))² + (q - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (p -6x -10)^2 + q² ) = 10.

So we have two equations:

1. p² + q² = (9x -2)²
2. (p -6x -10)^2 + q² = 10² = 100

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(p -6x -10)^2 + q² - p² - q² = 100 - (9x -2)^2

Expanding left side:

[p² - 2*(6x +10)*p + (6x +10)^2] - p² = -2*(6x +10)*p + (6x +10)^2

Thus:

-2*(6x +10)*p + (6x +10)^2 = 100 - (9x -2)^2

This seems complicated, but maybe we can proceed.

Let me compute RHS: 100 - (81x² - 36x +4) = 100 -81x² +36x -4 = 96 +36x -81x².

Left side: -2*(6x +10)p + (6x +10)^2.

Hmm. This seems messy. Perhaps there's another approach. Maybe using vectors or something else. Wait, but maybe we can consider coordinates of B such that triangle ABC has certain properties. But I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation involving point D. Since D is on AC, and there's line AD and DC. Is there any other information about point D? The problem states Line(A,D) and Line(D,C), but no other relations. Unless there's a triangle involving D?

Wait, maybe triangle ABD or BCD? But the problem doesn't mention any other lines except AB, BC, AC, AD, DC. So unless there's a connection between B and D, but the problem doesn't state that. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using mass point geometry? Or coordinate geometry?

Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the given predicates. Are there any other equalities?

We have:

LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is expressed as 6x+10, which comes from adding AD and DC. But we also have LengthOf(Line(A,B)) =9x-2 and LengthOf(Line(B,C))=10. So in triangle ABC, sides AB =9x-2, BC=10, AC=6x+10.

Therefore, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC? But we don't know any angles. Alternatively, using Stewart’s theorem? Since D is on AC, maybe Stewart’s theorem applies to triangle ABC with cevian BD? Wait, but we don’t know anything about BD. Unless... Wait, the problem does not mention BD, so maybe not.

Alternatively, since D is on AC, and we know AD and DC, maybe use Stewart’s theorem on triangle ABC with cevian BD. But we don't know BD's length. However, if there were more information about BD, but there isn't. So maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Since we have AB, BC, and AC in terms of x, maybe applying the triangle inequality. Earlier, we saw that x < 22/3 ≈7.33. So among the answer choices, D is 7, which is less than 7.33, so possible. But how to get the exact value?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, the coordinates are related. Let me go back to the earlier equations. From the two equations:

Equation 1: p² + q² = (9x -2)²  
Equation 2: (p -6x -10)^2 + q² = 100  

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:  
(p -6x -10)^2 + q² - p² - q² = 100 - (9x -2)^2  
Which simplifies to:  
(p -6x -10)^2 - p² = 100 - (81x² -36x +4)  
Expand left side:  
p² - 2*(6x+10)p + (6x+10)^2 - p² = -2*(6x+10)p + (6x+10)^2  
Right side: 100 -81x² +36x -4 = 96 +36x -81x²  

So:  
-2*(6x+10)p + (6x+10)^2 = -81x² +36x +96  

Let me rearrange this equation:  
-2*(6x+10)p = -81x² +36x +96 - (6x+10)^2  

Compute (6x+10)^2: 36x² + 120x + 100. So substitute:  
RHS becomes: -81x² +36x +96 -36x² -120x -100 = (-81x² -36x²) + (36x -120x) + (96 -100)  
= -117x² -84x -4  

So:  
-2*(6x+10)p = -117x² -84x -4  
Multiply both sides by -1:  
2*(6x+10)p = 117x² +84x +4  
Divide both sides by 2*(6x+10):  
p = [117x² +84x +4]/[2*(6x+10)]  

Simplify numerator and denominator. Let me see if the numerator factors with denominator. Let me factor numerator:

Numerator: 117x² +84x +4. Let me check discriminant to see if it factors. Discriminant D = 84² -4*117*4 = 7056 - 1872 = 5184. Square root of 5184 is 72. So roots are [-84 ±72]/(2*117). 

Calculating:

[-84 +72]/234 = (-12)/234 = -2/39  
[-84 -72]/234 = -156/234 = -2/3. 

So factors would be (ax + b)(cx + d). Let me try to factor. 

Since the product of coefficients is 117*4 = 468. Looking for numbers that multiply to 468 and add to 84. Wait, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, since we have roots at x=-2/39 and x=-2/3, the quadratic can be written as (x +2/39)(x +2/3) multiplied by leading coefficient. Wait, but original quadratic is 117x² +84x +4. Let me check:

Let me write it as 117(x + a)(x + b) = 117x² + (117a + 117b)x + 117ab. Comparing with 117x² +84x +4. So:

117a +117b =84 → a +b =84/117 = 28/39  
and 117ab =4 → ab=4/117.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe leave it as is. 

Anyway, regardless of factoring, the expression for p is [117x² +84x +4]/[2*(6x+10)]. Now, but how does this help us? Because we need more constraints to find x. 

Wait, but maybe there's another condition? For instance, the coordinates of point B must satisfy that AB and BC have the lengths given. But we already used those to derive this equation. So unless there's another constraint, like point B lying somewhere else?

Alternatively, maybe considering that D is on AC, and there's no other information about D. So maybe there's no further constraints. Thus, this approach might not yield x.

Wait, but perhaps I missed another equality. Let me recheck the given predicates. All the equalities are about lengths. So, the only other thing is that Line(A,D) is 6x+2, Line(D,C) is 8, and Line(A,C) is 6x+10. So that's covered. 

Wait, but what about the other lines mentioned? Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) have lengths 9x-2 and 10 respectively. So, in triangle ABC, we have three sides: AB=9x-2, BC=10, AC=6x+10. So, perhaps applying the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines? But without angles, maybe not. However, maybe there's a way to relate these. 

For example, using Heron's formula? But we would need to know the area, which we don't have. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC has integer lengths? Let me check for possible x values from the answer choices. Let me test each option.

Answer choices are A.3, B.4, C.6, D.7.

Let me plug in each x and see if the triangle inequalities hold, and if there are any contradictions.

First, let's check x=3 (option A):

AB =9x-2= 9*3-2=27-2=25. BC=10. AC=6x+10=6*3+10=18+10=28.

Check triangle inequalities:

AB + BC > AC: 25 +10 =35 >28 ✔️

AB + AC > BC: 25+28=53>10 ✔️

BC + AC > AB:10+28=38>25 ✔️

So valid triangle. No contradiction.

Next, x=4 (option B):

AB=9*4-2=36-2=34. BC=10. AC=6*4+10=24+10=34.

So sides are AB=34, BC=10, AC=34. So triangle with two sides equal (AB=AC=34). So isoceles triangle. Valid.

x=6 (option C):

AB=9*6-2=54-2=52. BC=10. AC=6*6+10=36+10=46.

Check triangle inequalities:

AB + BC =52+10=62 >46 ✔️

AB + AC=52+46=98>10 ✔️

BC + AC=10+46=56 >52 ✔️. Valid.

x=7 (option D):

AB=9*7-2=63-2=61. BC=10. AC=6*7+10=42+10=52.

Check triangle inequalities:

AB + BC=61+10=71>52 ✔️

AB + AC=61+52=113>10 ✔️

BC + AC=10+52=62>61 ✔️. Valid.

So all four options give valid triangles. Hence, this approach alone cannot determine x. Need another method.

Wait, but maybe there's more information from the coordinates approach. Earlier, we had an expression for p in terms of x. But unless we can find another equation involving p, we can't proceed. However, we might need to consider that point B must lie somewhere such that there's no inconsistency. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Let me recall that D is on AC, and there's no mention of other lines involving D. But maybe there's a property I haven't considered. For example, if lines AB and CD intersect at some point, but no, the problem doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or parametric equations. Let me think differently. Since D is on AC, and we have AD=6x+2, DC=8. So AC=AD+DC=6x+10. Now, suppose we consider vectorially, the position of D. But without knowing coordinates of B, it's unclear.

Wait, but maybe using Stewart’s theorem. Stewart’s theorem relates the length of a cevian in a triangle to the sides of the triangle. In our case, if we consider triangle ABC with cevian BD, where D is on AC. But we don't know the length of BD. However, maybe we can express BD in terms of x using coordinates?

Earlier, we tried to find coordinates of B, but couldn't resolve it. Let me try again. 

From earlier, we have p = [117x² +84x +4]/[2*(6x+10)]. Let me simplify this expression:

Let me divide numerator and denominator by (6x+10). Let me perform polynomial division on 117x² +84x +4 divided by 6x+10.

Dividing 117x² +84x +4 by 6x+10:

First term: (117x²)/(6x) = 19.5x. Multiply divisor by 19.5x: 19.5x*(6x+10) = 117x² + 195x. Subtract from dividend:

(117x² +84x +4) - (117x² +195x) = -111x +4.

Now, next term: -111x /6x = -18.5. Multiply divisor by -18.5: -18.5*(6x+10) = -111x -185. Subtract:

(-111x +4) - (-111x -185) = 0x + 189. 

So overall, the division gives 19.5x -18.5 with remainder 189. Hence,

p = [19.5x -18.5] + 189/(6x+10).

This seems messy, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since we have p expressed in terms of x, maybe we can find q from equation 1:

p² + q² = (9x -2)^2 → q² = (9x -2)^2 - p².

But without more info, this doesn't help. 

Wait, but maybe there's another constraint. For instance, the coordinates of B must satisfy that line BD exists, but since there's no info about BD, it's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe using slopes? For example, the slope of AB and BC? But again, no info. 

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption that D is on AC. What if D is not on AC? But the given lines are AD and DC, implying that D is connected to A and C, which would suggest that D lies on AC. Otherwise, AD and DC would not be straight lines. So yes, D must lie on AC. So that part is correct.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let me think again. Are there any other given equalities? The problem lists several Equals statements, but we've used them all. 

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that there's a miscalculation in assuming that AC = AD + DC. But according to the given predicates, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,C)))), which implies that AC is indeed the sum of AD and DC, hence D lies on AC. So that's correct. 

So, given that, maybe the problem requires another insight. Let me revisit the given equations:

From the first and third predicates, we have:

LengthOf(A,C) = LengthOf(A,D) + LengthOf(D,C) → 6x +10 = (6x +2) +8 → which holds for any x. So no help.

But we have another expression for LengthOf(A,C) as 6x+10, and also AB=9x-2, BC=10. So maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC?

In triangle ABC, by Law of Cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(theta), where theta is angle at B.

But we don't know theta. However, we can write:

(6x +10)^2 = (9x-2)^2 + 10^2 - 2*(9x-2)*10*cos(theta)

But without knowing cos(theta), this doesn't help. However, if we assume that angle at B is right angle, then cos(theta)=0, and we get:

(6x+10)^2 = (9x-2)^2 + 100.

Let me check this. If angle at B is right, then:

(6x+10)^2 = (9x-2)^2 + 10^2.

Expand both sides:

Left: 36x² + 120x +100

Right: 81x² -36x +4 +100 = 81x² -36x +104

Set equal:

36x² + 120x +100 = 81x² -36x +104

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 81x² -36x +104 -36x² -120x -100

Simplify:

(81x² -36x²) + (-36x -120x) + (104-100) = 45x² -156x +4 = 0

So 45x² -156x +4 = 0. Solve using quadratic formula:

Discriminant D = 156² -4*45*4 = 24336 - 720 = 23616. Square root of 23616 is 153.6... Wait, wait, let me calculate accurately:

156 squared is 24336. 4*45*4 = 720. So D = 24336 -720 = 23616.

√23616: Let me compute. 150²=22500, 153²=23409, 154²=23716. So between 153 and 154. 23616-23409=207. So √23616 ≈ 153.6...

But this doesn't seem to give integer solutions. So unless x is non-integer, but answer choices are integers. So this suggests that angle at B is not a right angle. Hence, this approach may not work.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Since D is on AC, and we have AD=6x+2, DC=8. Let me consider coordinates again. Assume A=(0,0), C=(L,0), where L=6x+10. D is at (AD,0)=(6x+2,0). Point B is somewhere in plane. We have AB=9x-2 and BC=10.

Let me try to find coordinates of B such that it satisfies both distances. Let me assume coordinates for B as (p,q). Then:

Distance from A to B: √(p² + q²) =9x-2 → p² + q² = (9x-2)^2.

Distance from B to C: √[(p-L)^2 + q²] =10 → (p-L)^2 + q² =100.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (p-L)^2 + q² - p² - q² =100 - (9x-2)^2 → expanding (p-L)^2 -p² = -2Lp + L² = 100 - (81x² -36x +4) → -2Lp + L² = -81x² +36x +96.

Here, L=6x+10. So substitute:

-2*(6x+10)*p + (6x+10)^2 = -81x² +36x +96.

Let me expand (6x+10)^2: 36x² +120x +100. So:

-2*(6x+10)*p +36x² +120x +100 = -81x² +36x +96.

Rearranging:

-2*(6x+10)*p = -81x² +36x +96 -36x² -120x -100.

Combine like terms on RHS:

-81x² -36x² = -117x²

36x -120x = -84x

96 -100 = -4

So RHS: -117x² -84x -4.

Thus:

-2*(6x+10)*p = -117x² -84x -4 → 

Multiply both sides by -1:

2*(6x+10)*p = 117x² +84x +4 → 

p = [117x² +84x +4]/[2*(6x+10)].

Now, this is the same as before. To find p, we need to ensure that this expression is valid. But how?

Maybe there's a value of x that makes this expression rational, or leads to real coordinates. But since x is an integer from the choices, let's substitute each option and see if it results in a valid p.

Let's try each option:

Option A: x=3

Calculate numerator: 117*(3)^2 +84*(3) +4 = 117*9 +252 +4 = 1053 +252 +4 = 1309

Denominator: 2*(6*3 +10) = 2*(18+10)=2*28=56

So p = 1309 /56 ≈23.375. Let me check if this is valid. 

Now, with x=3, AB=25, BC=10, AC=28. So, for point B, p≈23.375, and q² = (9x-2)^2 - p² = 25² - (1309/56)^2. Let me compute this:

25² =625. (1309/56)^2 = (approx 23.375)^2 ≈546.28. So q² ≈625 -546.28 ≈78.72. Positive, so valid. So possible.

Option B: x=4

Numerator: 117*(4)^2 +84*(4)+4 = 117*16 +336 +4 = 1872 +336 +4=2212

Denominator: 2*(6*4 +10)=2*(24+10)=2*34=68

p =2212 /68 = 32.5. Let me check q²:

AB=9*4-2=34, so q²=34² - (32.5)^2 = 1156 -1056.25 = 99.75. Positive, valid.

Option C: x=6

Numerator: 117*(6)^2 +84*6 +4 = 117*36 +504 +4 = 4212 +504 +4 = 4720

Denominator: 2*(6*6 +10)=2*(36+10)=2*46=92

p =4720/92 = 51.295... Let me compute q²: AB=52, so q²=52² - (4720/92)^2. Let me calculate 52² =2704. 4720/92 = 51.295. Squared is approx 2631. So q² ≈2704 -2631 =73. Positive, valid.

Option D: x=7

Numerator: 117*(7)^2 +84*7 +4 = 117*49 +588 +4 = 5733 +588 +4 = 6325

Denominator: 2*(6*7 +10)=2*(42+10)=2*52=104

p =6325 /104 ≈60.817. Then q² = (9*7-2)^2 - p² =61² - (60.817)^2 ≈ 3721 - 3699 =22. Positive, valid.

So all options give valid p and q. Still no help. 

Wait, but maybe there's a hidden constraint from the fact that D is on AC. For example, if we consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD? But without more info about angles or other lengths, I don't see how.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that ABC is a right triangle? If that's the case, then we can use Pythagoras. Let me try this. Assume that triangle ABC is right-angled. Which angle? At A, B, or C?

Let me check for each option.

For example, if it's right-angled at B, then AB² + BC² = AC².

Let's check for each x:

Option A: x=3 → AB=25, BC=10, AC=28.

Check 25² +10² = 625 +100 =725 vs 28²=784. Not equal.

Option B: x=4 → AB=34, BC=10, AC=34.

Check 34² +10² = 1156 +100 =1256 vs 34²=1156. Not equal.

Option C: x=6 → AB=52, BC=10, AC=46.

Check 52² +10² =2704 +100=2804 vs 46²=2116. Not equal.

Option D: x=7 → AB=61, BC=10, AC=52.

Check 61² +10² =3721 +100=3821 vs 52²=2704. Not equal.

Not matching. How about right-angled at A? Then AB² + AC² = BC²? No, because BC is 10, which is smaller than AC for x≥3. Not possible.

Or right-angled at C? Then AC² + BC² = AB².

Check for each x:

Option A: 28² +10² =784 +100=884 vs AB=25 → 25²=625. Not equal.

Option B: 34² +10²=1156+100=1256 vs AB=34 → 34²=1156. Not equal.

Option C: 46² +10²=2116 +100=2216 vs AB=52 → 52²=2704. Not equal.

Option D: 52² +10²=2704 +100=2804 vs AB=61 → 61²=3721. Not equal.

Nope. So triangle is not right-angled. Hence, this approach fails.

Wait, but what if there's another relation? Like, perhaps the coordinates of B must satisfy some condition related to D? For example, if line BD is perpendicular to AC? But there's no such information given.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, or I missed a predicate. Let me double-check the given predicates.

Original predicates:

Triangle(A,B,C)

Point(A)

Point(B)

Point(C)

Point(D)

Line(A,B)

Line(B,C)

Line(A,C)

Line(A,D)

Line(D,C)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 6x + 2)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), 8)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,C))))

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), 6x + 10)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 9x - 2)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 10)

Wait, notice that the third and fourth equals statements both describe LengthOf(Line(A,C)). The third says it is the sum of AD and DC, and the fourth says it is 6x+10. This is consistent, as we already saw. So no new info.

But what about the other equals statements? They are all about lengths. So no other info.

At this point, I'm stuck. All options seem possible based on triangle inequalities, and no other constraints. But since this is a math competition-style problem, there must be a unique answer. Where am I missing?

Wait! Let me look at the expressions for AC. From the third predicate, AC = AD + DC = 6x +2 +8 =6x+10, which matches the fourth predicate. So that's consistent. But what about the other lengths?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that D is on AC? What if D is not on AC, but instead, AD and DC are separate lines, forming a different configuration? But that would make AC not necessarily the sum of AD and DC. But the third predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), Add(...)), which implies that AC is the sum of AD and DC. Hence, D must be on AC. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if D is not between A and C, but extended beyond? Like, if D is on the extension of AC beyond C, then AD would be longer than AC. Let me check.

Suppose D is on the extension of AC beyond C. Then, AD = AC + CD. So, AD = (6x+10) +8 =6x+18. But the first predicate says AD =6x+2. So:

6x+18 =6x+2 → 18=2, which is impossible. Similarly, if D is on the extension of AC beyond A, then AD would be negative, which is not possible. Hence, D must be between A and C.

So that's confirmed. 

Another thought: perhaps using the concept of similar triangles? For example, if there's a ratio between segments. Let me think: AD/DC = (6x+2)/8. If there's a ratio related to AB/BC or something. But without knowing any similarity conditions, it's hard to say.

Wait, but if there's a line from B to D, creating similar triangles? For example, if BD is parallel to something? But no info on that.

Alternatively, using mass point geometry. If D divides AC into AD=6x+2 and DC=8, then the ratio AD/DC = (6x+2)/8. If there's a line BD, then masses at A and C would be proportional to DC and AD, respectively. But without knowing about BD, this might not help.

Wait, but maybe the problem involves the entire structure. For example, if ABC is a triangle with D on AC, and we have AB=9x-2, BC=10, AC=6x+10. Maybe using the Law of Cosines in combination with the ratio AD/DC?

Let me try. Let me denote AD =6x+2, DC=8, AC=6x+10. Let me call AD = m, DC = n, so m =6x+2, n=8, AC=m+n=6x+10.

Now, in triangle ABC, with D on AC. Let me apply the Law of Cosines on triangles ABD and CBD. But without knowing BD, it's difficult. Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines on ABC and relate to the ratio AD/DC.

Wait, let me consider the coordinates approach again. We have point B with coordinates (p, q), and we have expressions for p and q in terms of x. But since we don't have more info, maybe there's a condition that the y-coordinate q must satisfy some other relation? Like, for example, if there's a minimum or maximum value, but no.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that the expression for p must be a rational number, or something similar. Let me check for each option.

For x=3: p =1309/56 = 23.375, which is 23 + 3/8. Rational.

For x=4: p=2212/68 = 32.5, which is 32 + 1/2. Rational.

For x=6: p=4720/92 = 51.295... Let me divide 4720 by 92: 92*51 = 4692, 4720-4692=28, so 51 +28/92 = 51 +7/23. Rational.

For x=7: p=6325/104 = let's see: 104*60 =6240, 6325-6240=85. So 60 +85/104 = 60 + 85/104, which is rational.

So all options give rational p, so no help.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between p and q? For example, if there's a condition that BD is perpendicular to AC? Let me assume that. If BD is perpendicular to AC, then the slope of BD times slope of AC = -1. Let me explore this.

Since AC is horizontal (from earlier coordinate setup, A(0,0) to C(L,0)), so its slope is 0. Hence, a line perpendicular to AC would be vertical. So BD must be vertical. Hence, BD is vertical, meaning that B has the same x-coordinate as D. Since D is at (AD, 0) = (6x+2, 0), then B would have x-coordinate 6x+2. Hence, B is at (6x+2, q). Let me check if this is possible.

If B is at (6x+2, q), then AB distance is sqrt[(6x+2 - 0)^2 + (q - 0)^2] = sqrt[(6x+2)^2 + q²] = 9x-2. Squaring both sides: (6x+2)^2 + q² = (9x-2)^2.

Also, BC distance is sqrt[(6x+2 - L)^2 + q²], where L=6x+10. So:

sqrt[(6x+2 - (6x+10))^2 + q²] = sqrt[(-8)^2 + q²] = sqrt(64 + q²) =10.

So sqrt(64 + q²)=10 → 64 + q² =100 → q²=36 → q=±6.

So now, from AB: (6x+2)^2 + q² = (9x-2)^2. Substituting q²=36:

(6x+2)^2 +36 = (9x-2)^2.

Expand both sides:

Left: 36x² +24x +4 +36 =36x² +24x +40

Right: 81x² -36x +4

Set equal:

36x² +24x +40 =81x² -36x +4

Move all terms to left:

36x² +24x +40 -81x² +36x -4 = 0 → -45x² +60x +36 =0 → multiply by -1: 45x² -60x -36 =0.

Divide by 3: 15x² -20x -12 =0.

Solve using quadratic formula: x = [20 ±√(400 + 720)]/30 = [20 ±√1120]/30.

Simplify √1120 = √(16*70) =4√70 ≈4*8.366=33.464.

So x = [20 ±33.464]/30. Taking positive root: (20 +33.464)/30 ≈53.464/30 ≈1.782. Not in the answer choices. Negative root would give negative x, invalid. Hence, no solution under this assumption.

But wait, this suggests that if BD is perpendicular to AC, then
