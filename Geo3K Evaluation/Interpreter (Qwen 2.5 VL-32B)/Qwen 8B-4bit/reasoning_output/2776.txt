MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle ABCD. Let me recall that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, opposite sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal in length. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. 

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D forming a rectangle. Then there's a point E connected to various points. The given angles at B and D are 40 degrees each. Wait, the question asks for m∠8, but I need to figure out which angle that refers to. Since the problem mentions angles like ∠ABE and ∠CDE, maybe ∠8 is referring to one of those? Or perhaps another angle formed by point E?

Let me go through the given predicates again. There's Angle(A,B,E) and Angle(C,D,E). These would be angles at points B and D respectively. The measure of these angles is given as 40 degrees each. Also, it says that the triangles ABE and CDE are congruent. That suggests that some sides are equal. 

Also, there are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), etc., forming the rectangle. The diagonals AC and BD are lines connecting opposite corners. The problem also gives lengths: AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. Wait, so AE + EC equals AC? Because if E is a point along the diagonal AC, then AE + EC should equal the length of AC. But wait, the length of AC is given as equal to BD. So, since AC is split into AE=1 and EC=7, that means AC has total length 8. Therefore, BD must also be 8. But BD is split into BE=6 and ED=4, which adds up to 10. Wait, that doesn't make sense because AC and BD should be equal in a rectangle. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe E isn't on the diagonal AC? Wait, the Line(A,C) is given, so maybe E is somewhere else? Wait, no, the Line(A,C) is part of the rectangle's diagonal. Wait, but how does E relate to that?

Wait, looking back, the Line(A,C) is present, so AC is a diagonal. Similarly, Line(B,D) is present, so BD is the other diagonal. Now, the given lengths are AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. So, if E is a point such that it lies on both diagonals? No, because in a rectangle, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint. But here, the lengths AE=1 and EC=7 would mean that E is not the midpoint. Similarly, BE=6 and ED=4 implies E is not the midpoint of BD. Therefore, E is not the intersection point of the diagonals. Instead, E must be some other point inside the rectangle, connected to A, B, C, D with these segments.

But how? Let me think. If we have a rectangle ABCD, with diagonals AC and BD. Suppose point E is located such that lines AE, BE, CE, DE are drawn. Given that AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. Also, the triangles ABE and CDE are congruent. And angles at B and D are 40 degrees. 

Since triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, their corresponding sides and angles are equal. So AB corresponds to CD (since they're sides of the rectangle, hence equal), BE corresponds to ED (given as 6 vs 4? Wait, but that contradicts unless there's something wrong here. Wait, the problem states Congruent(Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(C,D,E)). So Triangle ABE ≅ Triangle CDE. Therefore, side AB corresponds to CD (which are equal in a rectangle), BE corresponds to DE, and AE corresponds to CE. Wait, but BE is 6 and DE is 4, which would imply BE=DE, but according to the given lengths, BE=6 and ED=4. That's conflicting. So maybe my assumption about correspondence is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. For example, maybe AB corresponds to CD, BE corresponds to DC, and AE corresponds to CE. Wait, but DC is equal to AB, so if BE corresponds to DC, then BE would be equal to DC. But DC is equal to AB, which is a side of the rectangle. However, we don't know the actual length of AB. Wait, but if Triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, then their corresponding sides must be equal. Let me list the sides:

In Triangle ABE: sides are AB, BE, AE.
In Triangle CDE: sides are CD, DE, CE.

Since AB = CD (as sides of rectangle), and if the triangles are congruent, then AB must correspond to CD, BE must correspond to DE, and AE must correspond to CE. Therefore, BE = DE and AE = CE. But according to the given data, BE=6 and DE=4, which aren't equal. This contradiction suggests that my initial assumption about the correspondence might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps AB corresponds to CE, BE corresponds to CD, and AE corresponds to DE? Not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is such that AB corresponds to CD, BE corresponds to DC, and AE corresponds to EC. Wait, but DC is equal to AB. So BE would correspond to DC, which is equal to AB. So BE would be equal to DC. But DC is a side of the rectangle, whose length we don't know yet. However, we do know AE=1 and EC=7, so AE+EC=AC=8. Similarly, BD is split into BE=6 and ED=4, so BD=10. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Hence, AC=BD. But according to this, AC=8 and BD=10. Contradiction! So this suggests that my understanding of where E is located is wrong. 

Wait, maybe E is not lying on the diagonals? But the problem includes Line(A,C) and Line(B,D), so maybe E is somewhere else. Wait, but the lines AE, BE, CE, DE are given. Wait, no, the given lines are Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(A,C), Line(B,D). So AC and BD are diagonals. But the point E is connected via lines AE, BE, CE, DE. So E is connected to A, B, C, D. So maybe E is inside the rectangle, connected to all four vertices? But then the lengths AE=1, BE=6, CE=7, DE=4. 

So AC is a diagonal of length 8 (AE + EC = 1 +7 =8). BD is another diagonal, but BE + ED =6+4=10. Which would imply that diagonals are unequal, but in a rectangle, diagonals are always equal. Hence, this suggests inconsistency. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, but the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), LengthOf(Line(B,D))). Oh, that's a given predicate! So AC equals BD. Therefore, even though AE + EC = 8 and BE + ED =10, that would imply that AC = BD =8? Wait, no. Wait, the length of Line(A,C) is the same as Line(B,D). So AC = BD. But according to the given lengths, AE=1, EC=7 → AC=8; BE=6, ED=4 → BD=10. But that contradicts the given predicate that AC equals BD. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Unless E is not on the diagonals? Wait, but the lines AE and CE are parts of the diagonal AC. So if AE is part of AC, then E must lie on AC. Similarly, BE and ED are parts of BD? Wait, but BD is a diagonal from B to D. If E is on BD, then BE + ED = BD. But according to the given, BD is equal to AC, which is 8. But BE + ED is 6+4=10. Contradiction again. So how is this possible?

This suggests that my interpretation is wrong. Maybe E is not on the diagonals? Wait, but the Line(A,C) exists, so AC is a diagonal. If AE is a segment from A to E, then E could be anywhere, but if it's connected to C, then E is on AC? No, not necessarily. Wait, the Line(A,C) is a straight line, but E may not be on that line. Wait, but the Line(A,C) is just a line; the presence of the line doesn't mean that E is on it. Wait, the Line(A,C) is part of the rectangle's structure, but E could be a separate point connected to A and C. Wait, but the problem states Line(A,C), which is the diagonal. But the existence of Line(A,C) doesn't imply that E is on that line. So maybe E is outside the rectangle? Or inside, but not on the diagonals?

Wait, but the problem gives us several lines: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(A,C), Line(B,D). So those are the edges and diagonals of the rectangle. So E is connected to A and C via Line(A,E) and Line(C,E)? Or is it that Line(A,E) and Line(C,E) exist? Wait, the predicates mention Line(A,E) and Line(C,E)? Wait, no. Let me check the original given predicates again.

Looking back, the user provided:

- Line(A, B)
- Line(B, C)
- Line(C, D)
- Line(D, A)
- Line(A, C)
- Line(B, D)

So those are the lines. So Line(A,C) and Line(B,D) are diagonals. Now, the other lines mentioned are:

- Angle(A, B, E): so E is a point such that B is the vertex, with segments BA and BE forming the angle.
- Similarly, Angle(C, D, E): E is the vertex with segments DC and DE.

Therefore, E is a point connected to B and D, forming angles at B and D. Also, there are lines AE and CE. Wait, the problem also includes:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, E)), 1)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, C)), 7)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, E)), 6)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, D)), 4)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), LengthOf(Line(B, D)))

Ah, so Line(A,E) is a segment from A to E, which has length 1. Line(E,C) is from E to C, length 7. Line(B,E) is from B to E, length 6. Line(E,D) is from E to D, length 4. Also, the diagonals AC and BD are equal in length. 

So AC is composed of AE + EC = 1 +7 =8, so AC =8. BD is composed of BE + ED =6 +4 =10. But the predicate says that AC equals BD. Hence, 8=10? That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe E is not on the diagonals AC and BD? But the line AC connects A to C. The segment AE is part of that line? Or is it a separate line? Wait, the Line(A,C) is defined as a line, but the segment AE could be part of that line. If E is on AC, then AE + EC = AC. Similarly, if E is on BD, then BE + ED = BD. But since AC and BD are equal, then 8=10. Contradiction. Hence, this suggests that E cannot be on both diagonals. Therefore, E must be somewhere else, not on either diagonal. 

But then, how can AE and EC be segments? If E is not on AC, then AE and EC are not parts of the same line. Wait, but the problem mentions Line(A,C), which is a line, but E is not necessarily on it. So maybe AE and EC are two separate lines. But the problem says "Line(A,E)" and "Line(E,C)", which would mean that AE and EC are lines. Wait, but the Line(A,E) is a line starting at A and going through E, and Line(E,C) starts at E and goes through C. So these two lines meet at E, making AE and EC segments. But unless E is on the line AC, these are two separate lines. 

Hmm, this complicates things. So E is a point connected to A, B, C, D with certain distances. Let me try to visualize this. We have rectangle ABCD. Point E is connected to A (distance 1), to B (distance 6), to C (distance 7), to D (distance 4). Additionally, triangles ABE and CDE are congruent. Angles at B and D are 40 degrees. 

Given that, maybe I can use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me assume that A is at (0,0), B is at (a,0), C at (a,b), D at (0,b), since it's a rectangle. Then, the diagonals AC and BD have length sqrt(a² + b²). 

Now, point E has coordinates (x,y). Then:

Distance from A to E: sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2) = 1 → x² + y² = 1² = 1.

Distance from B to E: sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-0)^2) = 6 → (x-a)^2 + y² = 36.

Distance from C to E: sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2) = 7 → (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = 49.

Distance from D to E: sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-b)^2) = 4 → x² + (y-b)^2 = 16.

Additionally, the diagonals AC and BD are equal: sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(a² + b²), which is trivially true. Wait, but earlier we had contradictions with the lengths of AC and BD being 8 and 10. But if E is not on the diagonals, then AC and BD remain as sqrt(a² + b²), which is fixed. 

But how do we find relations between a and b? Let's see. From the equations above:

From AE: x² + y² = 1.

From BE: (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 36. Subtract AE equation: (x-a)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) = 36 - 1 → x² - 2ax + a² + y² - x² - y² = 35 → -2ax + a² = 35 → -2ax = 35 - a² → x = (a² -35)/(2a).

Similarly, from DE: x² + (y - b)^2 = 16. Expand: x² + y² - 2by + b² = 16. From AE, x² + y² = 1, so substituting: 1 - 2by + b² = 16 → -2by + b² = 15 → -2by = 15 - b² → y = (b² -15)/(2b).

From CE: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = 49. Expand: (x² - 2ax + a²) + (y² - 2by + b²) = 49. Substitute x² + y² = 1, so:

1 - 2ax + a² - 2by + b² = 49 → (a² + b²) + (-2ax - 2by) +1 = 49.

We already have expressions for x and y in terms of a and b. Let's substitute them.

First, compute -2ax - 2by:

-2a*( (a² -35)/(2a) ) - 2b*( (b² -15)/(2b) )

Simplify term by term:

-2a * [(a² -35)/(2a)] = -(a² -35) = -a² +35.

Similarly, -2b * [(b² -15)/(2b)] = -(b² -15) = -b² +15.

Thus, combining:

(-a² +35) + (-b² +15) = -a² -b² +50.

So plugging back into the CE equation:

(a² + b²) + (-a² -b² +50) +1 = 49 → (a² + b² -a² -b²) +50 +1 = 49 → 0 +51 = 49 → 51 = 49. Contradiction!

This suggests inconsistency in the given data. But the problem states that all these conditions hold. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me recheck. 

Starting from CE: (x-a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = 49.

Expand this: x² - 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b² = 49.

Group x² + y²: from AE, x² + y² = 1. Thus:

1 - 2ax - 2by + a² + b² = 49.

Which rearranged gives:

a² + b² - 2ax - 2by +1 = 49 → a² + b² - 2ax - 2by = 48.

Earlier, I computed -2ax - 2by = -a² -b² +50, leading to:

a² + b² + (-a² -b² +50) = 48 → 50 = 48 → contradiction. 

So this indicates that the given conditions are inconsistent unless there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. The problem states that the diagonals AC and BD are equal. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal regardless of the rectangle's dimensions. So their lengths are sqrt(a² + b²). But from the previous equations, we arrived at a contradiction, implying that the given data is inconsistent. But since the problem presents this scenario, there must be a way around it. 

Perhaps my coordinate system is flawed. Let me consider that E is not inside the rectangle but outside? Or maybe the rectangle is degenerate? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles ABE and CDE are congruent in a different way. Earlier, I assumed that AB corresponds to CD, BE to DE, and AE to CE. But if the congruence is different, maybe AB corresponds to CE, BE to CD, and AE to DE? Let me explore that.

If Triangle ABE ≅ Triangle CDE, then corresponding sides:

AB = CE,

BE = CD,

AE = DE.

But in a rectangle, AB = CD. So if BE = CD, then BE = CD = AB. But BE is given as 6, so CD = AB = 6. But CD is a side of the rectangle, so AB = CD =6. Also, AE = DE. Given that AE=1 and DE=4, this would require 1=4, which is false. Hence, contradiction again. 

Another possibility: Triangle ABE ≅ Triangle CDE with AB corresponding to CD, BE corresponding to CE, and AE corresponding to DE. So AB = CD (which holds), BE = CE (so 6 =7?), which is false. 

Alternatively, AB corresponds to CD, AE corresponds to CE, and BE corresponds to DE. So AE=CE (1=7?) No. 

This seems to suggest that the given conditions are inconsistent, which can't be the case as it's a problem presented for solution. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the configuration. 

Wait, going back to the problem statement: It says "Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle." So it's definitely a rectangle. The angles at B and D are given as 40 degrees. Wait, the Angle(A,B,E) and Angle(C,D,E) are given as 4 0 degrees. So those are angles at B and D. 

Maybe instead of focusing on coordinates, I should look at triangle properties. Given that triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, and angles at B and D are 40 degrees. Let me consider triangle ABE and CDE. Since they are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. So angle at B (which is 40 degrees) corresponds to angle at D (also 40 degrees). So that aligns. 

Also, since ABCD is a rectangle, angles at B and D are right angles (90 degrees). Wait, no! Wait, in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. But the problem says that Angle(A,B,E) is 40 degrees, which is not a right angle. So E is a point such that when you connect it to B, creating an angle of 40 degrees with AB. Similarly for D. 

Let me draw this mentally: At point B, which is a corner of the rectangle, the angle between AB and BE is 40 degrees. Similarly, at D, the angle between CD and DE is 40 degrees. 

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC, AD is perpendicular to AB, etc. So at point B, AB is horizontal (assuming standard position), and BC is vertical. So if we have angle between AB and BE as 40 degrees, then BE makes a 40-degree angle with AB. 

Similarly, at D, the angle between CD and DE is 40 degrees. CD is horizontal (if AB is horizontal), so DE makes a 40-degree angle with CD. 

Now, considering triangles ABE and CDE are congruent. Their corresponding sides and angles are equal. 

Let me focus on triangle ABE. We know BE=6, AE=1, and angle at B is 40 degrees. Using the Law of Sines on triangle ABE:

sin(angle at A)/BE = sin(angle at B)/AE.

Wait, but without knowing more angles or sides, it's tricky. However, since triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. So AB = CD, BE = DE, and AE = CE. But earlier, BE=6 and DE=4, which would mean BE ≠ DE. Contradiction. So again, inconsistency. 

But the problem says that BE=6 and DE=4. So this suggests that the correspondence is not direct. Perhaps the triangles are congruent via SAS, but with different sides? 

Wait, if the triangles are congruent, then their corresponding sides must be equal. So if angle at B (40°) corresponds to angle at D (40°), and if AB corresponds to CD (which are equal), then maybe BE corresponds to DC, and AE corresponds to DE. Wait, but DC is equal to AB, which is a side of the rectangle. If BE corresponds to DC, then BE = DC. But BE=6, so DC=6. Similarly, AE corresponds to DE, so AE=DE → 1=4? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are congruent via ASA. Let me think. In triangle ABE, angle at B is 40°, and in triangle CDE, angle at D is 40°. If the sides adjacent to these angles are proportional... Wait, but for congruence, the included sides must be equal. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangles ABE and CDE. Let's take triangle ABE: sides AE=1, BE=6, angle at B=40°. So applying Law of Cosines to find AB:

AB² = AE² + BE² - 2*AE*BE*cos(angle at B).

Wait, no. Law of Cosines formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Here, angle at B is between sides AB and BE, with opposite side AE. So:

AE² = AB² + BE² - 2*AB*BE*cos(angle at B).

Plugging numbers:

1² = AB² + 6² - 2*AB*6*cos(40°).

So:

1 = AB² + 36 - 12*AB*cos(40°).

Rearranging:

AB² - 12*cos(40°)*AB + 35 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in AB. Solving for AB:

AB = [12*cos(40°) ± sqrt( (12*cos(40°))² - 4*1*35 )]/2.

Compute numerical values. Let's calculate cos(40°). Approximately, cos(40°) ≈ 0.7660.

Then, 12*0.7660 ≈ 9.192.

Discriminant: (9.192)^2 - 4*1*35 ≈ 84.5 - 140 = -55.5. Negative discriminant implies no real solutions. Impossible! So this suggests that such a triangle ABE cannot exist with the given parameters. 

This indicates a fundamental problem with the given data. But since this is a problem posed for solution, I must have misinterpreted something. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not the ones I think. The problem says Angle(A,B,E) is 40 degrees. That means angle at B between A and E. So in triangle ABE, angle at B is 40 degrees. But if that leads to no solution, then there must be another explanation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between AB and BE, but between BA and BE? No, the notation Angle(A,B,E) denotes the angle at B between A and E. So yes, that's correct. 

At this point, I'm stuck. The given data seems inconsistent. However, since this is a problem from a textbook or similar, there must be a way to resolve it. Let me revisit the problem statement once more to ensure I didn't miss anything.

The problem says:

Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. m∠2 = 40. Find m∠8.

Wait, maybe the angles referred to as 2 and 8 are specific to the diagram, but since I don't have the diagram, I need to infer. Usually, in such problems, angles labeled sequentially. For example, if the rectangle has points A, B, C, D in order, then angles at B and D are involved. The angles mentioned are ∠ABE and ∠CDE, which are 40 degrees each. The question asks for m∠8, which could refer to another angle, possibly involving point E.

Assuming that ∠8 is the angle at E between BE and DE, or some other angle. Alternatively, it could be an external angle or something else. 

Alternatively, since triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, and angles at B and D are 40°, maybe there's a relationship between the other angles. Let me consider triangle ABE. We have angle at B = 40°, and sides AE=1, BE=6. Even though earlier calculation suggested impossibility, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the angle is at B. Wait, no, the angle is at B. 

Wait, perhaps the Law of Sines applies here. In triangle ABE:

sin(angle at A)/BE = sin(angle at B)/AE.

So, sin(angle at A)/6 = sin(40°)/1 → sin(angle at A) = 6*sin(40°). 

Calculate 6*sin(40°): sin(40°) ≈ 0.6428 → 6*0.6428 ≈ 3.857. But sine of an angle can't exceed 1. So this is impossible. Hence, no solution. 

This confirms that the given data is inconsistent. But since this is a problem, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the given lengths are not AE=1 and EC=7, but something else? Wait, let me double-check the predicates:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, E)), 1) → AE=1

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, C)), 7) → EC=7

Yes. So AC=8. 

But in a rectangle, diagonals are equal. So BD should also be 8. But BE=6 and ED=4 give BD=10. Conflict. 

Unless E is not on BD? But the line BD exists, and E is connected to D. Wait, the line ED is part of the problem. So E is connected to D, but not necessarily on BD. Wait, but Line(B,D) is present, so BD is a line. If E is not on BD, then BE and ED are not parts of BD. Hence, BD's length is still sqrt(a² + b²), while BE + ED = 6 + 4 =10. So sqrt(a² + b²) =10. But AC=8, so sqrt(a² + b²)=8. Hence, 8=10. Still conflict.

This suggests that the problem contains inconsistent data, which is unlikely. Therefore, I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. m∠2 = 40. Find m∠8."

Maybe the angles labeled 2 and 8 are not the ones I thought. Perhaps the diagram labels angles in a specific way. For example, in some diagrams, angles are numbered sequentially. If ∠2 is at B, and ∠8 is at E, or some other angle.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at E. For instance, if ∠2 is one of the angles at E, and ∠8 is another. But without the diagram, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions angles at B and D being 40°, and the triangles ABE and CDE being congruent, maybe there's a way to find other angles using triangle properties. 

Let me consider that in triangle ABE, we have AE=1, BE=6, angle at B=40°. Even though mathematically this seems impossible, maybe the problem assumes some approximation or uses a different approach. Let's proceed hypothetically.

Using the Law of Sines, as before:

sin(angle at A)/BE = sin(angle at B)/AE → sin(angle at A)/6 = sin(40°)/1 → sin(angle at A) = 6*sin(40°) ≈ 3.857, which is invalid. So this suggests no solution. 

But maybe the problem uses vectors or coordinate geometry with E outside the rectangle? Let's try to place E outside. 

Suppose E is outside the rectangle. Let me assume coordinates again. Let me set A at (0,0), B at (a,0), C at (a,b), D at (0,b). Let E have coordinates (x,y). 

From AE=1: x² + y² =1.

From BE=6: (x-a)^2 + y² = 36.

Subtracting first equation: (x-a)^2 + y² - x² - y² = 36 -1 → x² -2ax +a² -x² = 35 → -2ax +a² =35 → x = (a² -35)/(2a).

From DE=4: x² + (y - b)^2 =16.

From CE=7: (x-a)^2 + (y - b)^2 =49.

Subtract DE equation from CE equation: [(x-a)^2 + (y - b)^2] - [x² + (y - b)^2] = 49 -16 → (x-a)^2 -x² =33 → x² - 2ax +a² -x² = -2ax +a² =33. 

But from earlier, we have -2ax +a² =35. So 35 =33? Contradiction. 

Hence, no solution. 

This suggests that the problem is ill-posed. However, since it's a problem to solve, I must have misunderstood the setup. Perhaps the lengths are not AE=1 and EC=7, but rather AE=1 and EC=7, but E is not on AC? But then, how can EC be measured? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses vector magnitudes or something else. Alternatively, the given lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else? Unlikely. 

At this point, I'm unable to reconcile the given data. However, since the problem asks for m∠8, and the options are 40, 50, 80, 100, perhaps there's a way to deduce it using the given angles and congruence. 

Since triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, and angles at B and D are 40°, perhaps the other angles in the triangles are supplementary or something. For example, in triangle ABE, angles sum to 180°. So angle at B is 40°, angle at A is ?, angle at E is ?. If we could find those, maybe relate to other angles. 

But without valid lengths, it's difficult. Alternatively, if we ignore the length inconsistencies and proceed. Assume that in triangle ABE, angle at B is 40°, and suppose that the other angles are such that the triangle is possible. 

For example, let's say angle at A is α, angle at E is β. So 40 + α + β = 180 → α + β = 140. 

Similarly, in triangle CDE, angle at D is 40°, so same logic. 

Since triangles are congruent, α and β are equal to corresponding angles in the other triangle. 

But how does this help? Maybe relating to the rectangle's angles. 

Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle at A is 90°. In triangle ABE, angle at A is α. So α is part of the 90° angle at A. Hence, α < 90°. 

Similarly, at point D, angle between CD and DE is 40°, and angle at D in the rectangle is 90°, so the remaining angle would be 90° - 40° = 50°, which might be related to angle at E in triangle CDE. 

Wait, if at point D, the angle between CD and DE is 40°, then the remaining angle at D (between DA and DE) would be 90° - 40° = 50°. If this relates to some other angle. 

If triangles ABE and CDE are congruent, then the angles at E in both triangles are equal. Let's call this angle γ. So in triangle ABE, angle at E is γ, and in triangle CDE, angle at E is also γ. 

If we consider the full picture, at point E, there might be multiple angles. For example, if lines EA, EB, EC, ED form some configuration, the angles at E could add up to certain totals. 

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. But if we assume that the angles at E are supplementary or something. 

Alternatively, since the problem asks for m∠8, and given that one of the angles at B and D is 40°, and the others involve 50°, maybe the answer is 50°, which is option B. 

Given the options, and the fact that in the rectangle, if at D the angle between CD and DE is 40°, then the other part is 50°, which might be the desired angle. Hence, selecting B.50.
