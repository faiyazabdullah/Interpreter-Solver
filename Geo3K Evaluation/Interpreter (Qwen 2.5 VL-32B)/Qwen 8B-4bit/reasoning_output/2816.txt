Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points R, S, T, V, X, Y. Lines connecting them: R-S, V-T, R-X, X-Y, Y-T. There's a quadrilateral RSTV. Also, some lengths: RS is 6 units, VT is 3 units. They mention that RS and VT are parallel. Then there are right angles at R,X,V and S,Y,T, and another right angle at R,X,T. Also, RX is twice XV. Plus, triangles RXV and SYT are similar. 

Wait, the question asks for XY. So, we need to find the length of segment XY. Let me try to visualize this. Since there's a quadrilateral RSTV, maybe it's a trapezoid because RS and VT are parallel? Given that RS || VT, so yes, a trapezoid. But also, there are right angles mentioned. Let me check again.

They say RightAngle(Angle(R,X,V)) – so angle at X between R and V is a right angle. Similarly, Angle(S,Y,T) is a right angle. And another right angle at R,X,T. Wait, that seems like angle at X between R and T? Or maybe angle at X involving R and T? Wait, the syntax is Angle(R,X,T), so vertex at X, with segments XR and XT. So that would mean that angle at X between R and T is a right angle. Hmm, but if RX is connected to X and V, and X is connected to Y and T?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points R and S form a line RS of length 6. Points V and T form line VT of length 3, which is parallel to RS. Then, there's point X connected to R and to Y. Also, Y is connected to T. Also, there's a right angle at R,X,V, meaning that RX is perpendicular to XV. Also, right angle at S,Y,T, meaning SY is perpendicular to YT. Another right angle at R,X,T, so RX is perpendicular to XT? Wait, but if RX is connected to X and T, then angle at X between R and T is a right angle. So that suggests that RX is perpendicular to XT. Wait, but earlier we had RX is perpendicular to XV. That would imply that XV and XT are both perpendicular to RX, making XV and XT colinear? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps X is a point where two lines meet. Let me think.

Since RX is part of the line R-X, and XV is connected to X. Also, there's a line X-Y and Y-T. Also, the triangle RXV has sides RX, XV, and RV. And since there's a right angle at X, triangle RXV is a right triangle with legs RX and XV, and hypotenuse RV. Similarly, triangle SYT is a right triangle with legs SY and YT, and hypotenuse ST. Also, these two triangles are similar. 

Given that RX is twice XV. So, RX = 2*XV. Also, RS is 6, VT is 3, and RS || VT. Since RS and VT are parallel, and the quadrilateral RSTV is a trapezoid. Now, considering the right angles, maybe these triangles are similar in a certain ratio. 

Let me note down the given lengths:

RS = 6, VT = 3. Since RS || VT, and the trapezoid RSTV. Also, RX is twice XV. Let me denote XV as x, so RX = 2x. Then, since triangle RXV is right-angled at X, by Pythagoras, RV² = RX² + XV² = (2x)^2 + x^2 = 4x² + x² = 5x². Therefore, RV = x√5. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Also, since the triangles RXV and SYT are similar. Let's see. For similarity, corresponding angles should be equal. Since both are right triangles, their corresponding angles are equal. So, the ratio of their sides should be the same. 

So, the ratio of similarity between triangle RXV and SYT would be the ratio of their corresponding sides. Let me assume that the correspondence is RX corresponds to SY, XV corresponds to YT, and RV corresponds to ST. Because the right angles are at X and Y respectively. 

Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be RX / SY = XV / YT = RV / ST. 

Also, since RS and VT are parallel, and given that RS is 6 and VT is 3, which are the bases of the trapezoid. However, I'm not sure yet about the relationship between the triangles and the trapezoid. Maybe the triangles are constructed on the legs of the trapezoid? Alternatively, since there are right angles at X and Y, perhaps those points are somewhere along the sides of the trapezoid?

Alternatively, considering the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's place point R at (0,0). Since RS is 6 units long, and assuming RS is horizontal, then point S would be at (6,0). Since RS is parallel to VT, and VT is 3 units. Let me assume that VT is also horizontal. But where are points V and T located? 

But there's a right angle at R,X,V. So, RX is perpendicular to XV. If R is at (0,0), and X is somewhere such that RX is one leg, and XV is the other leg. Let me suppose that X is at (a,b). Then, vector RX would be from R(0,0) to X(a,b), and vector XV would be from X(a,b) to V. Since RX is perpendicular to XV, their dot product is zero. 

But maybe it's easier to assign coordinates step by step. Let me try. 

Let me set R at (0,0). Since RS is 6 units, and let's take RS as horizontal. So S is at (6,0). Now, since RS || VT, and VT is length 3. Let me assume that VT is also horizontal. So, points V and T are placed such that VT is parallel to RS. But where?

Additionally, there's a right angle at R,X,V. So, angle at X between R and V is right. Which implies that RX ⊥ XV. Let me consider that. Suppose X is somewhere above the line RS. Let me define coordinates for X. Let me say that X is at (p,q). Then, vector RX is (p, q), and vector XV is (v_x - p, v_y - q). Their dot product must be zero: p(v_x - p) + q(v_y - q) = 0. 

But without knowing V's coordinates, this might get complicated. Maybe there's another way. 

Since RX is twice XV. Let me denote XV as length m, so RX is 2m. In triangle RXV, right-angled at X, so RX^2 + XV^2 = RV^2 → (2m)^2 + m^2 = RV^2 → 5m² = RV² → RV = m√5. 

Now, the triangles RXV and SYT are similar. So, their sides are proportional. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k. Then, the sides of RXV correspond to the sides of SYT. Since both are right triangles, the ratios of corresponding legs and hypotenuses are equal. 

Assuming that RX corresponds to SY, XV corresponds to YT, and RV corresponds to ST. So, RX/SY = XV/YT = RV/ST = k. 

Also, since RS is 6 and VT is 3, and RS || VT, maybe there's a relation between these. But how do RS and VT relate to the triangles?

Alternatively, since RS and VT are the top and bottom bases of the trapezoid, and the height of the trapezoid could be related to the heights of the triangles RXV and SYT. 

Wait, but the right angles at R,X,V and S,Y,T suggest that the triangles RXV and SYT are constructed on the sides of the trapezoid. Let me think. 

For example, in the trapezoid RSTV, with RS || VT. The legs are RT and SV. But maybe not. Wait, the trapezoid's sides are RS, ST, TV, VR. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles RXV and SYT are drawn on the sides of the trapezoid. For instance, RXV could be attached to side RV, and SYT attached to side ST. 

But I need more concrete relations. Let me think about the right angles. At point X, angle RXV is right, so RX ⊥ XV. Similarly, at point Y, angle SYT is right, so SY ⊥ YT. Additionally, there's a right angle at R,X,T. Wait, Angle(R,X,T) is right, so RX ⊥ XT. Wait, that would mean that RX is perpendicular to XT. But earlier, we had RX ⊥ XV. So, if RX is perpendicular to both XV and XT, then XV and XT must lie on the same line, meaning that points V and T are aligned with X. But that may not necessarily be true unless there's more constraints. 

Wait, if RX is perpendicular to both XV and XT, then XV and XT are both perpendicular to RX, implying that XV and XT are colinear. Thus, points V, X, T are colinear? Because both XV and XT are perpendicular to RX, so they lie on the same line. Hence, V, X, T are colinear. Therefore, line XV is part of line XT. So, point X lies between V and T? Or vice versa? 

But then, the line V-T is given as length 3. If V, X, T are colinear, then VX + XT = VT = 3. But we know that RX is twice XV. Let me denote XV as x, so RX = 2x. But since V, X, T are colinear, and XT is the remaining part of VT. So, if VT = 3, then VX + XT = 3. But since RX is perpendicular to XV and XT, then XV and XT are perpendicular to RX. Therefore, RX is perpendicular to the entire line VTX. So, RX is perpendicular to line VT, which is given as being parallel to RS. Wait, RS is parallel to VT. So, RS || VT, and RX is perpendicular to VT, which means RX is also perpendicular to RS. So, RX is perpendicular to RS. 

Wait, but RS is a horizontal line if we imagine it as such. So, RX is vertical. So, if RS is horizontal, then RX is vertical. Therefore, point X is vertically above or below R. But since there's a right angle at R,X,V, and RX is vertical, then XV would be horizontal. Wait, if RX is vertical, then XV would be horizontal, since it's perpendicular. So, point V would be horizontally aligned with X. 

Similarly, since line V-T is parallel to RS (which is horizontal), then line VT is horizontal. So, if V is horizontally aligned with X, then T is also horizontally aligned with V, hence with X. Therefore, points V, X, T are colinear horizontally. 

Let me try to formalize this. Assume RS is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let’s fix coordinate system:

Let’s place point R at (0,0). Since RS is 6 units, and horizontal, point S is at (6,0). Since RS || VT, VT is also horizontal. 

RX is perpendicular to RS, so RX is vertical. So, point X is directly above or below R. Let's assume it's above, so X is at (0, h) for some h. 

Then, since RX is vertical, and angle at X between R and V is right, so XV is horizontal. Therefore, point V is horizontally aligned with X. Since XV is horizontal, moving left or right from X. Let me assume direction. Since line VT is horizontal (parallel to RS), and V is connected to T. Let me suppose that V is to the right of X, so V is at (a, h), and since XV is horizontal, the x-coordinate of V is same as X's x-coordinate plus some distance. Wait, if X is at (0,h), then XV is horizontal, so V would be at (k, h) for some k. Then, since line VT is horizontal, T would be at (k + t, h), such that VT = 3. So, the length of VT is |t| = 3. 

But also, since RX is twice XV. The length of RX is from R(0,0) to X(0,h): that's h units. The length of XV is from X(0,h) to V(k,h): that's |k - 0| = |k|. Given RX = 2 * XV, so h = 2*|k|. Assuming k positive, then h = 2k. 

Now, line V-T is from V(k,h) to T(k+3,h), since VT is length 3. So T is at (k + 3, h). 

Now, looking at the other right angle: Angle(R,X,T) is a right angle. This means that at point X, the angle between RX and XT is right. Since RX is vertical (from X(0,h) up/down), and XT goes from X(0,h) to T(k+3,h). Wait, XT is horizontal? No, XT is from X(0,h) to T(k+3,h), which is horizontal. So, RX is vertical, XT is horizontal. Therefore, angle at X between RX and XT is indeed a right angle. Perfect, that checks out. 

So, with this setup, we have:

- R(0,0)
- S(6,0)
- X(0,h)
- V(k,h)
- T(k+3,h)

With h = 2k (since RX = 2 * XV => h = 2k).

Now, what about point Y? We have line X-Y and Y-T. Also, there's a right angle at S,Y,T, meaning angle at Y between S and T is right. So, SY is perpendicular to YT. 

Let me find coordinates for Y. Let me think. Since Y is connected to X and T. Let me consider the line YT. Since angle at Y between S and T is right, so SY ⊥ YT. Let me find coordinates for Y.

First, we need to find Y such that SY is perpendicular to YT. Let me denote Y as (p, q). 

Vector SY is from S(6,0) to Y(p,q): (p-6, q-0) = (p-6, q). Vector YT is from Y(p,q) to T(k+3,h): ((k+3)-p, h - q). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(p - 6)( (k + 3) - p ) + q*(h - q) = 0.

Also, since Y is connected to X(0,h) via line X-Y. So, Y lies somewhere on line X(0,h) to ... Well, we don't know yet. But also, there's a triangle SYT, which is similar to triangle RXV. 

Earlier, we said that triangles RXV and SYT are similar. Let me recall that. 

Triangle RXV has legs RX = h, XV = k, and hypotenuse RV. Triangle SYT has legs SY and YT, and hypotenuse ST. Since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. 

From earlier, RX = 2k, XV = k. So, the ratio of RX to XV is 2. So, in the similar triangles, the ratio of SY to YT should also be 2. 

But wait, depending on which sides correspond. Since angle at X for RXV is right, and angle at Y for SYT is right, the correspondence is likely RX corresponds to SY, XV corresponds to YT, and RV corresponds to ST. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is RX/SY = XV/YT = RV/ST = 2. 

Therefore, SY = RX / 2 = h / 2. And YT = XV / 2 = k / 2. 

But we also have that SY and YT are legs of triangle SYT, which is right-angled at Y. So, SY^2 + YT^2 = ST^2. 

But let me compute ST. Point S is at (6,0), point T is at (k+3,h). So, ST length squared is [(k+3 - 6)]^2 + (h - 0)^2 = (k - 3)^2 + h^2. 

On the other hand, SY^2 + YT^2 = (SY)^2 + (YT)^2 = (h/2)^2 + (k/2)^2. 

Setting them equal: 

(h/2)^2 + (k/2)^2 = (k - 3)^2 + h^2 

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

h² + k² = 4[(k - 3)^2 + h²]

Expand RHS: 4(k² -6k +9 + h²) = 4k² -24k +36 +4h²

So equation becomes:

h² + k² = 4k² -24k +36 +4h²

Bring all terms to left:

h² + k² -4k² +24k -36 -4h² = 0 

Combine like terms:

(-3h²) + (-3k²) +24k -36 = 0 

Divide both sides by -3:

h² + k² -8k +12 = 0 

But we also have from before that h = 2k. Let me substitute h = 2k into this equation:

(2k)^2 + k² -8k +12 = 0 

Which is 4k² +k² -8k +12 = 0 → 5k² -8k +12 = 0 

Wait, solving quadratic equation 5k² -8k +12=0. Discriminant D = 64 - 240 = -176 < 0. That's impossible. So contradiction here. What did I do wrong?

Hmm, maybe my assumption about the correspondence of the similar triangles is incorrect. Perhaps the similarity is different. Let me reconsider. 

Triangles RXV and SYT are similar. Which sides correspond? Since both are right triangles. The right angles are at X and Y respectively. So, the legs adjacent to the right angles would be RX & XV for RXV, and SY & YT for SYT. Therefore, the similarity would require that RX corresponds to SY and XV corresponds to YT, or RX corresponds to YT and XV corresponds to SY. Depending on orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me check the original statement: Similar(Triangle(R,X,V), Triangle(S,Y,T)). So, the vertices are ordered R,X,V and S,Y,T. So, the correspondence is R→S, X→Y, V→T. Therefore, the sides RX corresponds to SY, XV corresponds to YT, and RV corresponds to ST. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is RX/SY = XV/YT = RV/ST. 

So, as before, RX/SY = XV/YT. Since RX = 2k, XV = k, then RX/XV = 2. Therefore, SY/YT = 2. So, SY = 2 YT. 

But earlier, I assumed SY = RX / 2, which was wrong. Instead, since RX/SY = XV/YT = 2, then SY = RX / 2? Wait, let's clarify:

If RX corresponds to SY, and XV corresponds to YT, then RX/SY = XV/YT. So, RX/SY = XV/YT ⇒ RX/XV = SY/YT. Since RX/XV = 2, then SY/YT = 2 ⇒ SY = 2 YT. 

So, SY = 2 YT. 

But SY and YT are legs of triangle SYT. So, SY^2 + YT^2 = ST^2. 

Also, SY = 2 YT. Let me denote YT = m, so SY = 2m. Then, SY^2 + YT^2 = (2m)^2 + m^2 = 5m² = ST². 

But ST is the hypotenuse of triangle SYT. 

Now, ST is the segment from S(6,0) to T(k+3,h). As before, its square is (k+3 -6)^2 + (h - 0)^2 = (k - 3)^2 + h². 

Thus, 5m² = (k-3)^2 + h². 

But what is m? m is YT, which is the length from Y to T. How can we express m?

But we also have that Y lies on line X-Y. Wait, line X-Y connects X(0,h) to Y. Wait, but we don't know where Y is. However, we also have that angle at Y between S and T is right, so SY ⊥ YT. 

Let me find coordinates for Y. Since Y is connected to X and to T. Also, SY ⊥ YT. 

Let me parametrize Y. Let me assume that Y lies somewhere such that SY is perpendicular to YT. 

Let me use the earlier equations. Let me denote Y as (p, q). 

Vector SY = (p - 6, q - 0) = (p - 6, q)

Vector YT = ( (k+3) - p, h - q )

Their dot product is zero:

(p - 6)[(k + 3) - p] + q(h - q) = 0 

Expanding:

(p - 6)(k + 3 - p) + qh - q² = 0 

This is one equation. 

Also, since Y lies on line X-Y. Wait, but we haven't used that yet. Wait, the line X-Y connects X(0,h) to Y(p,q). So, Y lies on line X(0,h) to wherever. But we don't know where, unless there's more info. 

Wait, but there's also the fact that Y is connected to T, forming line Y-T. So, Y is somewhere such that it's connected to X and T. But how? Unless there's more constraints. 

Alternatively, since triangle SYT is similar to triangle RXV, and we know the ratio between their sides. 

Earlier, we had that SY = 2 YT. Let me write that. From similarity, SY / YT = RX / XV = 2. So SY = 2 YT. 

But how can I find YT? 

Let me consider that Y lies on line X(0,h) to somewhere. Wait, but we also have that line X-Y is present. So, Y is on line X(0,h) extended? Or is it part of another structure? 

Alternatively, since we have line X-Y and Y-T, which forms line Y-T. Also, since line X-Y is part of the diagram. 

Maybe we can find coordinates for Y by combining the previous equations. 

Let me proceed with the equation from the perpendicularity:

(p - 6)(k + 3 - p) + qh - q² = 0 

Also, since Y lies on line X-Y, which connects X(0,h) to Y(p,q). Wait, but that's just saying that Y is on the line passing through X and Y, which is trivial. Wait, maybe I meant something else. 

Wait, the line X-Y is given, so Y is a point such that it's connected to X. But without more info, perhaps we need to use the similarity condition. 

Since triangle SYT ~ triangle RXV with ratio 2. So, the ratio of similarity is 2. So, the sides of SYT are twice those of RXV? Or depends on the correspondence. 

Wait, earlier, the ratio is RX/SY = XV/YT = RV/ST = 2. So, SY = RX / 2, YT = XV / 2. Wait, no, if RX/SY = 2, then SY = RX / 2. And XV/YT = 2, so YT = XV / 2. 

Wait, earlier mistake: If RX/SY = 2, then SY = RX / 2. And XV/YT = 2 ⇒ YT = XV / 2. 

But earlier, I thought SY = 2 YT, which was wrong. Let me correct that. 

So, from the similarity ratio: 

RX / SY = XV / YT = RV / ST = 2. 

So, RX = 2 SY, XV = 2 YT. 

Therefore, SY = RX / 2 = (2k)/2 = k. 

And YT = XV / 2 = k / 2. 

So, SY = k and YT = k/2. 

Now, since SY is the length from S(6,0) to Y(p,q), which is sqrt[(p-6)^2 + (q)^2] = k. 

And YT is the length from Y(p,q) to T(k+3,h), which is sqrt[ (k+3 - p)^2 + (h - q)^2 ] = k/2. 

Also, we have the perpendicularity condition:

(p - 6)(k + 3 - p) + qh - q² = 0. 

Let me square the expressions for SY and YT:

For SY: (p-6)^2 + q^2 = k² 

For YT: (k+3 - p)^2 + (h - q)^2 = (k/2)^2 

Let me expand the second equation:

(k+3 - p)^2 + (h - q)^2 = k² / 4 

Let me call this Equation (1). 

Also, from the first equation: (p-6)^2 + q^2 = k² → Equation (2). 

Let me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):

[(k+3 - p)^2 + (h - q)^2] - [(p-6)^2 + q^2] = k² / 4 - k² = -3k² / 4 

Expanding the left side:

Expand (k+3 - p)^2 = ( (k+3) - p )² = (k+3)^2 - 2p(k+3) + p² 

Similarly, (h - q)^2 = h² - 2hq + q² 

Minus [(p-6)^2 + q²] = -(p² - 12p + 36) - q² 

Putting together:

Left side becomes:

[k+3]^2 - 2p(k+3) + p² + h² - 2hq + q² - p² + 12p - 36 - q² 

Simplify term by term:

k+3 squared: (k+3)^2 

-2p(k+3) remains 

+p² cancels with -p² 

+h² - 2hq 

+q² - q² cancels 

-12p? Wait, wait:

Original expansion: 

After expanding (k+3-p)^2: (k+3)^2 - 2p(k+3) + p² 

Then add (h - q)^2: + h² - 2hq + q² 

Then subtract (p-6)^2: which is - [p² - 12p + 36] = -p² + 12p - 36 

Subtract q²: -q² 

So overall:

(k+3)^2 - 2p(k+3) + p² + h² - 2hq + q² - p² + 12p - 36 - q² 

Simplify:

(k+3)^2 - 2p(k+3) + h² - 2hq +12p -36 

Combine like terms:

Terms with p: -2p(k+3) +12p = p[-2(k+3) +12] = p[ -2k -6 +12 ] = p( -2k +6 )

Other terms: (k+3)^2 + h² -2hq -36 

So total expression equals:

(k+3)^2 + h² -2hq -36 + p(-2k +6) = -3k² / 4 

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since we have h = 2k, let's substitute that. Recall that h = 2k. 

So replace h with 2k. 

Also, from Equation (2): (p-6)^2 + q^2 = k² 

From Equation (1): (k+3 - p)^2 + (2k - q)^2 = k² / 4 

Let me expand Equation (1):

(k+3 - p)^2 + (2k - q)^2 = [ (k+3 - p)^2 ] + [ (2k - q)^2 ]

Expand both:

First term: (k+3 - p)^2 = (p - (k+3))^2 = p² - 2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 

Second term: (2k - q)^2 = q² -4kq +4k² 

Adding both terms:

p² - 2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 + q² -4kq +4k² 

Set equal to k²/4:

p² - 2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 + q² -4kq +4k² = k²/4 

Now, from Equation (2): p² + q² = k² + 2p(k+3) - (k+3)^2 ? Wait, no. Wait, Equation (2) is (p-6)^2 + q^2 = k². Expand that: p² -12p +36 + q² = k² → p² + q² = k² +12p -36. 

So, substituting p² + q² from Equation (2) into the expanded Equation (1):

Replace p² + q² with k² +12p -36. 

So, Equation (1) becomes:

[ k² +12p -36 ] -2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 -4kq +4k² = k²/4 

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Equation (1) after expansion is:

p² - 2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 + q² -4kq +4k² = k²/4 

Group p² + q² as per Equation (2):

p² + q² = k² +12p -36 

So substituting:

(k² +12p -36) -2p(k+3) + (k+3)^2 -4kq +4k² = k²/4 

Now, simplify term by term:

Start with k² +12p -36 

-2p(k+3) = -2pk -6p 

+(k+3)^2 = k² +6k +9 

-4kq 

+4k² 

So combine all:

k² +12p -36 -2pk -6p +k² +6k +9 -4kq +4k² 

Combine like terms:

k² +k² +4k² = 6k² 

12p -6p = 6p 

-2pk 

-36 +9 = -27 

+6k 

-4kq 

So overall:

6k² +6p -2pk +6k -4kq -27 = k²/4 

Rearranged:

6k² +6p -2pk +6k -4kq = k²/4 +27 

This seems very complex. Maybe I need another approach. 

Recall that we also have the perpendicularity condition. Earlier, we had:

(p - 6)(k + 3 - p) + qh - q² = 0 

With h = 2k, so:

(p - 6)(k + 3 - p) + q(2k) - q² = 0 

Let me expand (p - 6)(k + 3 - p):

Let me write it as -(p -6)(p - (k+3)) = -(p² - (k+3)p -6p +6(k+3)) 

Wait, alternatively, expand directly:

(p -6)(k +3 -p) = (p -6)(-p +k +3) = -p(p -6) + (k+3)(p -6) 

But maybe it's easier to expand as follows:

Let me denote A = p -6, B = k +3 -p 

So AB = (p-6)(k+3 -p) = -(p-6)(p - (k+3)) 

But perhaps not helpful. Let me instead multiply out:

(p -6)(k +3 -p) = (p -6)(k +3) - p(p -6) 

= p(k+3) -6(k+3) -p² +6p 

= pk +3p -6k -18 -p² +6p 

= -p² + (3p +6p) + pk -6k -18 

= -p² +9p +pk -6k -18 

So the entire equation becomes:

-p² +9p +pk -6k -18 + 2kq - q² = 0 

But from Equation (2), we have p² + q² = k² +12p -36. Let me rearrange this to p² = k² +12p -36 - q². Substituting into the above equation:

- [k² +12p -36 - q²] +9p +pk -6k -18 + 2kq - q² = 0 

Expanding:

-k² -12p +36 + q² +9p +pk -6k -18 + 2kq - q² = 0 

Simplify terms:

-k² -12p +36 +9p +pk -6k -18 +2kq 

Combine like terms:

- k² 

-12p +9p = -3p 

+pk 

-6k 

+36 -18 = +18 

+2kq 

So:

- k² -3p + pk -6k +18 +2kq = 0 

Rearrange:

pk -3p -6k +2kq = k² -18 

Factor terms:

p(k -3) + k(-6 +2q) = k² -18 

Hmm, still complex. Let me see if I can find another relation. 

We also know from the earlier equation derived from the similarity and perpendicularity conditions. This seems too tangled. Maybe I need to make assumptions or find relations between variables. 

Let me recall that we have from the earlier quadratic equation when I made a mistake, which led to a negative discriminant. But that was due to incorrect correspondence. Now, with corrected correspondence, let me revisit that. 

Previously, I had tried to derive an equation leading to 5k² -8k +12 = 0, which had no real roots. But that was under wrong assumptions. Let me try again with the corrected SY and YT lengths. 

Earlier, we had that ST² = 5m², where m = YT = k/2. Wait, no. Let me recall: 

From the similarity, SY = k, YT = k/2. So, SY^2 + YT^2 = k² + (k/2)^2 = 5k²/4 = ST². 

But ST is the distance between S(6,0) and T(k+3,h). With h = 2k. So:

ST² = (k+3 -6)^2 + (2k - 0)^2 = (k -3)^2 + (2k)^2 = k² -6k +9 +4k² = 5k² -6k +9 

But according to similarity, ST² = 5k²/4. 

So:

5k² -6k +9 = 5k²/4 

Multiply both sides by 4:

20k² -24k +36 = 5k² 

Subtract 5k²:

15k² -24k +36 = 0 

Divide by 3:

5k² -8k +12 = 0 

Same as before! So this leads to discriminant D = 64 - 240 = -176 < 0. Still no solution. Contradiction. 

What's wrong here? It suggests that there's no real solution, which can't be. So, there must be an error in assumptions. 

Let me review. The key assumptions were: 

1. The correspondence of similar triangles is RXV ~ SYT with RX/SY = XV/YT = 2. 

2. The calculation of ST² = 5k²/4. 

But where is the mistake? 

Wait, ST is the hypotenuse of triangle SYT, which has legs SY and YT. So, ST² = SY² + YT². But SY = k, YT = k/2. So, ST² = k² + (k/2)^2 = 5k²/4. 

But ST is also computed as distance between S(6,0) and T(k+3, 2k). So, ST² = (k+3 -6)^2 + (2k - 0)^2 = (k-3)^2 + (2k)^2 = k² -6k +9 +4k² = 5k² -6k +9. 

Setting equal to 5k²/4:

5k² -6k +9 = 5k²/4 

Multiply by 4: 20k² -24k +36 = 5k² → 15k² -24k +36 = 0 → 5k² -8k +12 = 0. 

Still no solution. This suggests inconsistency. 

Perhaps the correspondence of the similar triangles is different? Maybe the similarity is in reverse? Like RXV ~ TYS or something else? Let me check. 

The similarity is stated as Similar(Triangle(R,X,V), Triangle(S,Y,T)). So, the correspondence is R→S, X→Y, V→T. So, the order matters. 

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is reversed: Triangle RXV ~ Triangle YTS? Let me try that. 

If the correspondence is RXV ~ YTS, then the sides RX corresponds to YT, XV corresponds to TS, and RV corresponds to YS. 

In that case, RX/YT = XV/TS = RV/YS. 

But this requires checking. 

Let me assume that. Let's say the similarity is RXV ~ YTS. So, RX corresponds to YT, XV corresponds to TS, RV corresponds to YS. 

Then, RX/YT = XV/TS = RV/YS. 

Given RX = 2k, XV = k, so RX/XV = 2. Therefore, YT/TS = 2. 

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to approach differently. 

Let me go back to the initial data. The problem says that RX is twice XV. So, RX = 2 XV. Also, RS = 6, VT = 3, and RS || VT. The right angles at R,X,V; S,Y,T; and R,X,T. Also, triangles RXV and SYT are similar. 

Let me consider the ratios. Since RS || VT, and the right angles at R,X,V and S,Y,T, perhaps the triangles are similar with ratio 2:1, since RS is double VT. 

Because RS is 6, VT is 3. So, if the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides should be in ratio 2:1. 

But how does this relate to the triangles RXV and SYT? 

If the similarity ratio is 2:1, then the sides of RXV are twice those of SYT. 

But earlier, we saw that this leads to inconsistencies. Maybe the similarity is in the other direction. 

Let me assume that triangle RXV is similar to triangle SYT with ratio 1:2. So, RX/SY = 1/2, XV/YT = 1/2. 

Then, SY = 2 RX = 2*(2k) = 4k, and YT = 2 XV = 2k. 

But then, for triangle SYT, which is right-angled at Y, SY and YT are legs. So, ST² = SY² + YT² = (4k)^2 + (2k)^2 = 16k² +4k² = 20k². 

Meanwhile, ST is the distance between S(6,0) and T(k+3, 2k). So, ST² = (k+3-6)^2 + (2k - 0)^2 = (k-3)^2 + (2k)^2 = k² -6k +9 +4k² = 5k² -6k +9. 

Setting equal to 20k²:

5k² -6k +9 = 20k² → -15k² -6k +9 = 0 → 15k² +6k -9 = 0 → Divide by 3: 5k² +2k -3 = 0. 

Discriminant D = 4 + 60 = 64. Roots: [-2 ±8]/10. Positive root: (6)/10 = 3/5. So k = 3/5. 

So, k = 3/5. 

Then, h = 2k = 6/5. 

Now, with this value of k, we can find coordinates of T: T is at (k+3, h) = (3/5 + 3, 6/5) = (18/5, 6/5). 

Now, let's find point Y. 

We know that YT = 2k = 2*(3/5) = 6/5. And SY = 4k = 12/5. 

Point Y is such that SY = 12/5 and YT = 6/5, and SY ⊥ YT. 

Let me find coordinates of Y. 

Let me denote Y as (p, q). 

Distance from S(6,0) to Y: sqrt((p-6)^2 + q^2) = 12/5 → (p-6)^2 + q^2 = (144)/25. 

Distance from Y to T(18/5, 6/5): sqrt((18/5 - p)^2 + (6/5 - q)^2) = 6/5 → (18/5 - p)^2 + (6/5 - q)^2 = 36/25. 

Also, vectors SY and YT are perpendicular. 

Vector SY is (p-6, q). 

Vector YT is (18/5 - p, 6/5 - q). 

Their dot product is zero: (p-6)(18/5 - p) + q*(6/5 - q) = 0. 

Let me expand this:

(p-6)(18/5 - p) + q*(6/5 - q) = 0 

Expand (p-6)(18/5 - p): 

= p*(18/5 - p) -6*(18/5 - p) 

= 18p/5 - p² - 108/5 +6p 

= (18p/5 + 30p/5) - p² - 108/5 

= 48p/5 - p² - 108/5 

Plus q*(6/5 - q) = 6q/5 - q² 

Total equation:

48p/5 - p² - 108/5 + 6q/5 - q² = 0 

Multiply through by 5 to eliminate denominators:

48p -5p² -108 +6q -5q² = 0 

Rearranged: 

-5p² -5q² +48p +6q -108 = 0 

Divide by -1: 

5p² +5q² -48p -6q +108 = 0 

Now, we also have two equations from distances:

1. (p-6)^2 + q^2 = 144/25 → expand: p² -12p +36 + q² = 144/25 → p² + q² = 144/25 +12p -36 

Let me calculate 144/25 - 36 = 144/25 - 900/25 = -756/25. So, p² + q² = 12p -756/
