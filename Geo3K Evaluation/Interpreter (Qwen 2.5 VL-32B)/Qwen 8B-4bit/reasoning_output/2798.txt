Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

Starting with the points: there are several points mentioned—A, B, C, F, G, E. Then there are lines connecting them. For example, Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A) form triangle ABC. Also, Pentagon(F,G,E,C,B) means those five points form a pentagon. There's a Circle(G), so point G is the center of the circle? Wait, but the InscribedIn predicate says Polygon(F,G,E,C,B) is inscribed in Circle(G). So the pentagon F-G-E-C-B is inscribed in the circle centered at G? Or wait, maybe the circle has center G? But usually, if a polygon is inscribed in a circle, the circle is called the circumcircle, and its center is the circumcenter. However, here it's specified as Circle(G), so perhaps G is the center. Let me note that.

Also, there are tangent lines: Line(F,G), Line(G,E), Line(E,C), Line(C,B), Line(B,F) are all tangent to Circle(G). Wait, but if the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, then those lines would be sides of the pentagon. But if they're tangent to the circle, that suggests each side is tangent. That seems conflicting because if a polygon is inscribed in a circle, its sides are chords, not tangents. Hmm, maybe there's something wrong here. Wait, but maybe the pentagon is not convex? Or perhaps some other configuration?

Wait, the polygon is Pentagon(F,G,E,C,B). Let me list the vertices in order: F connected to G, G to E, E to C, C to B, B to F. So the sides are FG, GE, EC, CB, BF. Now, these sides are all tangent to the circle at G. Wait, but how can a side be tangent to a circle? Each side is a line segment. If a line is tangent to a circle, it touches the circle at exactly one point. But if the entire side is tangent, then each side should touch the circle at one point. However, since the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, that would mean all its vertices lie on the circle. But if the sides are also tangent, that seems contradictory. Unless the circle is tangent to each side, but the vertices are on the circle. Wait, that's possible. For example, in a tangential polygon, where all sides are tangent to an incircle. But here, the polygon is inscribed in a circle (circumcircle) and also has an incircle (tangential)? Wait, but the problem states that the polygon is inscribed in the circle, and each of its sides is tangent to the circle. That would imply that the polygon is both cyclic (inscribed in a circle) and tangential (has an incircle), making it bicentric. However, not all polygons are bicentric. For a polygon to be bicentric, certain conditions must be met, like having equal sums of opposite sides in a quadrilateral, but for pentagons, the conditions are more complicated. However, the problem mentions that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Wait, but the user said to assume the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Wait, but the given predicates don't say the polygon is regular. Wait, the problem statement says: "Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated." So even though the predicates mention Pentagon(F,G,E,C,B), we can assume it's regular. Therefore, the regular pentagon is inscribed in a circle (the circumcircle) and also has an incircle (tangency). Wait, but in reality, regular polygons have both an incircle and a circumcircle. For example, a regular pentagon has both. So in that case, the sides are tangent to the incircle and pass through the circumcircle. Wait, but the problem says that the sides are tangent to the circle (which is presumably the circumcircle?), but that contradicts because the sides are chords of the circumcircle, not tangent. So there's confusion here. Maybe the circle mentioned is the incircle? Wait, the predicate says InscribedIn(Polygon(F,G,E,C,B), Circle(G)). So the polygon is inscribed in the circle, meaning all its vertices lie on the circle. But the sides are tangent to the circle. How can a polygon be inscribed in a circle and have its sides tangent to the same circle? That seems impossible unless the polygon is degenerate. Wait, unless the circle is the incircle. But the incircle is tangent to the sides, not passing through the vertices. So there's a contradiction here. Unless the circle is both the circumcircle and incircle, but that would require the polygon to be bicentric. However, regular polygons are bicentric, so maybe that's the case here. Let me think again.

If the polygon is regular, then it has both an incircle and a circumcircle. In that case, the sides are tangent to the incircle and the vertices lie on the circumcircle. But the problem states that the polygon is inscribed in the circle (so vertices on the circle) and that each side is tangent to the circle. So the circle here must be the incircle. Therefore, the circle is the incircle of the pentagon, and the polygon is regular. Therefore, the circle is tangent to each side of the pentagon, and the pentagon is inscribed in another circle (its circumcircle). However, the problem's predicates state that the polygon is inscribed in Circle(G), implying that the circle is the circumcircle. This seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the circle is the incircle, and the polygon is circumscribed around it. But the predicate says InscribedIn(Polygon(...), Circle(...)), which typically means the polygon is inside the circle with vertices on it. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is the incircle, and the polygon is tangent to it. But the wording is "InscribedIn", which usually refers to the polygon being inscribed in the circle (vertices on the circle). So maybe there's a misstatement here. However, given that the problem says to assume the polygon is regular, let's proceed under that assumption.

So assuming the pentagon F-G-E-C-B is regular. Since it's regular, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal. Also, it's inscribed in a circle (its circumcircle). Additionally, the sides are tangent to another circle (incircle). But according to the problem's predicates, the sides are tangent to Circle(G), which is probably the incircle. However, the problem also mentions that the polygon is inscribed in Circle(G). Wait, that can't be. Because if the polygon is inscribed in the circle, then the circle is the circumcircle. But the sides being tangent to the circle implies the incircle. So there's inconsistency here. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the circle is both the incircle and the circumcircle? Which is only possible for certain polygons. Regular polygons have both, but the radius of the incircle and circumcircle differ. For a regular pentagon, the distance from the center to a vertex (circumradius) is different from the distance from the center to a side (inradius).

Given that the problem includes the predicate Tangent(Line(F,G), Circle(G)), etc., which suggests that each side is tangent to the circle. So if the circle is the incircle, then the polygon is circumscribed about the circle, i.e., the circle is tangent to all sides. However, the predicate says the polygon is inscribed in the circle, which would imply that the circle passes through all vertices. This is conflicting. Therefore, there must be some error in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the circle is the circumcircle (passing through vertices) and the sides are tangent to another circle. But the problem only mentions one circle, Circle(G). So the circle mentioned in the predicates is both the circumcircle and the incircle? That's not possible unless it's a special case. But in general, for regular polygons, the incircle and circumcircle are distinct. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

But given that the problem says to assume the polygon is regular, perhaps we need to ignore the conflict and proceed. Let's try to work with that. Assuming the pentagon is regular, with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Given that, and that the circle is associated with the polygon. Let's consider that the circle mentioned is the incircle. Then, the length of the sides can be related to the inradius. Alternatively, if the circle is the circumcircle, then the side length relates to the circumradius.

But the problem also gives us that the LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals 84. Line(A,B) is part of triangle ABC, which is formed by points A, B, C. From the Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A), forming triangle ABC. Also, the pentagon is F-G-E-C-B. So point C is shared between the triangle and the pentagon. Let me sketch mentally: Points A, B, C form a triangle. Points F, G, E, C, B form a pentagon. So point C is common. Also, point B is common between the triangle and pentagon. Point G is part of the pentagon and the circle. Also, the circle is associated with the pentagon. 

Now, the shaded region is Shape(ABC - FGECB). So subtracting the pentagon FGECB from triangle ABC. So the shaded area is the area of triangle ABC minus the area of pentagon FGECB. 

Therefore, to find the area of the shaded region, compute Area(ABC) - Area(FGECB). 

First, compute Area(ABC). Triangle ABC has side AB = 84 units. But we need more information. Wait, but do we know if ABC is equilateral? Not necessarily. However, the problem doesn't specify, but maybe there are relations due to the pentagon's properties. Alternatively, since the pentagon is regular, perhaps ABC is related to it. Let's explore.

Since the pentagon is regular, all its sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of the pentagon as s. Since the pentagon is regular, the length of each side is s. Now, looking at the pentagon F-G-E-C-B. The sides are FG, GE, EC, CB, BF. From the Line(C,B) which is part of the pentagon, so CB is a side of the pentagon. Also, CB is a side of triangle ABC. Therefore, CB is equal to s. Similarly, BF is another side of the pentagon, so BF = s. 

Additionally, in triangle ABC, AB = 84. We need to relate AB to the pentagon's side length. To do that, we need to see how points A, B, C are positioned relative to the pentagon. 

Looking at the Lines: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A). So triangle ABC is connected via points A-B-C-A. The pentagon includes points F, G, E, C, B. So the pentagon goes from F to G to E to C to B and back to F. So the side BF connects B to F. Thus, BF is a side of the pentagon and thus length s. 

But how does this connect to triangle ABC? Let's consider the position of point A. The triangle ABC has vertices A, B, C. The pentagon has vertices F, G, E, C, B. So point C is shared. 

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose the pentagon F-G-E-C-B is a regular pentagon. Then, each side is length s, and the internal angles are 108 degrees. The points F, G, E, C, B are arranged such that moving from F to G to E to C to B to F. So, point C is adjacent to E and B. Therefore, EC and CB are sides of the pentagon. So EC is length s, CB is length s. 

Now, in triangle ABC, CB is one side (length s), and AB is given as 84. So AB is a different side of the triangle. But we need more info about triangle ABC. 

Perhaps triangle ABC shares some relation with the pentagon. For instance, point A could be connected to other points. But from the given lines, there's Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A). So triangle ABC is separate from the pentagon except for sharing points B and C. 

However, there's also Line(B,F) which is a side of the pentagon. So BF is a side of the pent, hence length s. Therefore, in triangle ABC, AB = 84, BC = s, and AC is another side. But without knowing angles or other sides, it's hard to compute the area directly. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between the triangle and the pentagon. For example, if point A is connected to F, or some other connection? But the given lines are only up to Line(C,A). 

Alternatively, since the pentagon is regular and inscribed in a circle (assuming the circle is the circumcircle), then the points F, G, E, C, B lie on the circle. So the circle's center is G, as per the Circle(G) predicate. Wait, earlier confusion arises here. The predicate says Circle(G), so G is the center? If the pentagon is inscribed in the circle with center G, then G is the circumcenter of the pentagon. 

But if the pentagon is regular, its circumcenter is equidistant from all vertices. So the center G is the center of the regular pentagon. 

Moreover, the sides of the pentagon are tangent to the circle? No, if the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, then its sides are chords, not tangents. However, the problem states that Line(F,G), Line(G,E), etc., are tangent to Circle(G). Wait, if the circle is centered at G, then the line FG would be a radius, since F is a vertex of the pentagon lying on the circle. Wait, if the circle is centered at G, then GF is a radius. But the line FG is a side of the pentagon. So the line FG is a radius? No, because the line FG is a side of the pentagon, which connects two vertices. In a regular pentagon, the length of a side is equal to the radius times some factor. Wait, in a regular pentagon, the side length s is related to the circumradius R by s = 2R sin(π/5). 

But the problem also says that the lines FG, GE, EC, CB, BF are tangent to the circle. Wait, but if the circle is centered at G, then the line FG starts at F and ends at G. If the line FG is tangent to the circle, then the line FG would touch the circle at exactly one point. However, since the circle is centered at G, and the line FG starts at F (a point on the circle) and goes to G (the center), then the line FG would pass through G and F, which is a radius. Thus, the line FG would intersect the circle at F and G? Wait, no, the circle is centered at G, so the radius is from G to any vertex. So point F lies on the circle, so GF is a radius. The line FG is from F to G, which is a radius. But a tangent line at F would be perpendicular to the radius GF. However, the line FG itself isn't tangent; it's a radius. So this seems contradictory. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Perhaps the circle is not centered at G, but instead, the circle is tangent to the lines FG, GE, EC, CB, BF. So the circle is tangent to each of these lines. In that case, the circle would be the incircle of the pentagon. However, the predicate says InscribedIn(Polygon(F,G,E,C,B), Circle(G)), which usually means the polygon is inscribed in the circle, i.e., the vertices lie on the circle. But if the circle is tangent to the sides, then it's the incircle. So there's inconsistency. 

Maybe the problem uses non-standard terminology. Let's try to reinterpret. Suppose the circle is the incircle of the pentagon. Then, the polygon is circumscribed about the circle, meaning the circle is tangent to each side. The predicate InscribedIn might be incorrectly used, but we'll proceed with the idea that the circle is the incircle. 

If the pentagon is regular, then it has an incircle. The radius r of the incircle (apothem) is related to the side length s by r = (s / 2) * cot(π/5). 

Also, the circumradius R of a regular pentagon is R = s / (2 sin(π/5)). 

But how does this relate to the triangle ABC? Let's think. 

We know that AB = 84. If we can express AB in terms of the pentagon's parameters, we can find s, then compute the areas. 

But how? Let's look for connections between the triangle ABC and the pentagon. 

Points involved: A, B, C are part of triangle ABC. Points F, G, E, C, B are part of the pentagon. So point C is common. 

From the lines, Line(B,F) is a side of the pentagon (BF), so BF = s. Also, Line(C,B) is a side of the pentagon (CB), so CB = s. 

Thus, in triangle ABC, we have CB = s, and AB = 84. But we need more info about triangle ABC. Perhaps AC is also related to the pentagon? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is related to the pentagon in another way. For example, if point A is connected to G or another point? But the given lines only include Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A). 

Wait, there's also Line(A,B) which is part of the triangle. Let's think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points can help. 

Let me attempt coordinate geometry. Let's place point B at origin (0,0), point C at (s, 0), since CB = s. Then, point B is at (0,0), point C is at (s, 0). 

Now, the pentagon F-G-E-C-B. Let's assume it's regular. So starting from point F, going to G, then E, then C, then B, then back to F. 

In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108 degrees. The coordinates of the points depend on the orientation. However, since the pentagon includes points C and B, which are at (s, 0) and (0,0), respectively. 

Let me try to model this. Let’s assume the regular pentagon has vertices labeled sequentially as F, G, E, C, B. So from F to G to E to C to B to F. 

To find coordinates, we can use polar coordinates. Let's suppose the pentagon is oriented such that point C is at (s, 0), and point B is at (0,0). Let me calculate the coordinates of the other points. 

In a regular pentagon, the angle between each vertex from the center is 72 degrees (360/5). Let's assume the center of the pentagon is at some point O. But we need to find the position of the center. 

Alternatively, since points C and B are two consecutive vertices of the pentagon, separated by length s. The vector from C to B is (-s, 0). In a regular pentagon, the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 72 degrees. 

But calculating the exact coordinates might be complex. Let me think differently. 

Since the pentagon is regular, the distance from the center to each vertex (the circumradius) is R. The side length s is related to R by s = 2R sin(π/5). 

But we also have that CB is a side of the pentagon, so CB = s. Also, in the triangle ABC, CB = s, and AB = 84. 

But how to relate AB to the pentagon? Perhaps point A is related to another vertex of the pentagon. For example, if point A is connected to F, but the given lines only include Line(A,B). 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is part of the pentagon's structure. For instance, if A is another vertex of the pentagon? But the pentagon's vertices are F, G, E, C, B. So A is not among them. 

Alternatively, maybe point A is located such that Line(A,B) is connected to the pentagon. But without more info, this is unclear. 

Wait, but the shaded region is ABC minus FGECB. So the area of ABC minus the area of the pentagon. To compute this, we need both areas. 

If we can find the area of triangle ABC and the area of the pentagon, then subtract them. 

For the pentagon, since it's regular, its area is (5/2) * s^2 * cot(π/5). 

For triangle ABC, we need more information. But we know AB = 84, and CB = s. If we can find AC or an angle, we can compute the area. 

But how? Let's think about the triangle ABC. If we can relate AB to the pentagon's parameters, maybe through some geometric relations. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is related to the pentagon's diagonals. For example, in a regular pentagon, the diagonal length is φ*s, where φ is the golden ratio (~1.618). 

But how does this connect to triangle ABC? Let me think: If points A, B, C are arranged such that AB is a diagonal of the pentagon, but that depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, considering that Line(A,B) is given, and Line(B,C) is part of the pentagon (CB = s). So if we can find the coordinates of A, B, C, we can compute AB and other sides. 

Let me try placing coordinates. Let's set point B at (0,0), point C at (s, 0). Let's assume the pentagon's vertices are arranged such that from point B, moving to C, then to E, then to G, then to F, then back to B. Wait, the pentagon is F-G-E-C-B-F. So the order is F -> G -> E -> C -> B -> F. 

So from point B, the next point is F. So BF is a side of the pentagon, length s. So point F is somewhere such that the distance from B(0,0) to F is s. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. 

Let me consider the regular pentagon with points C and B as two of its vertices. Let's assume the pentagon is oriented such that CB is horizontal. The regular pentagon has internal angles of 108 degrees. So the angle at point C is 108 degrees. 

In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108°, and the external angle is 72°. 

Let me try to find coordinates of the other points. Let's denote the center of the pentagon as O. The distance from O to each vertex is R (circumradius). 

But without knowing the exact position, this might be complex. Alternatively, since we know CB = s, and in a regular pentagon, the distance between two adjacent vertices is s. 

But how to relate this to the triangle ABC. 

Alternatively, if we can find the length AC, then we can use Heron's formula for triangle ABC. But we need more information. 

Wait, but maybe triangle ABC is related to the pentagon's diagonals. For example, if AC is a diagonal of the pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the length of a diagonal is φ*s ≈ 1.618s. 

If AC is a diagonal, then AC = φ*s. Then, in triangle ABC, we have sides AB=84, BC=s, and AC=φ*s. Using the Law of Cosines, we can write:

AB² = AC² + BC² - 2*AC*BC*cos(angle at C)

But angle at C in the pentagon is 108°, so if angle ACB is 108°, then:

AB² = (φ*s)^2 + s^2 - 2*(φ*s)*s*cos(108°)

But this requires knowing the angle at C. Is angle ACB equal to 108°? It depends on how the points are arranged. 

If points A, B, C are such that angle at C is the internal angle of the pentagon, then yes. But unless A is another vertex of the pentagon, this may not hold. 

But since A is not part of the pentagon, this assumption may not be valid. 

Alternatively, if point A is located such that AB is a side of the pentagon. But AB is given as 84, while the pentagon's side is s. So if AB is a side of the pentagon, then s = 84. But then CB is also s = 84. Then, in triangle ABC, AB = CB = 84, making it an isoceles triangle with base AC. But without knowing AC or angles, we cannot find the area. 

But this is speculative. Let me think again. 

The key is to find the area of the shaded region, which is Area(ABC) - Area(pentagon). To find this, we need expressions for both areas. 

Assuming the pentagon is regular with side length s, its area is (5/2) * s² * cot(π/5). 

For triangle ABC, if we can express its area in terms of s, then subtract the pentagon's area. 

But how to find Area(ABC)? We know AB = 84, and CB = s. If we can find AC or an angle, we can use the formula (1/2)*ab*sin(theta). 

Alternatively, if we can find the height of the triangle. 

But without more information, this is difficult. 

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between AB and the pentagon's parameters. 

Let me recall that in a regular pentagon, the diagonal length is φ*s, where φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. 

If AB is a diagonal of the pentagon, then AB = φ*s. Given that AB = 84, then s = 84 / φ ≈ 84 / 1.618 ≈ 51.9. 

Then, the area of the pentagon would be (5/2)s²*cot(π/5). 

And the area of triangle ABC would depend on whether it's related to the pentagon's diagonals. 

But why would AB be a diagonal? Because in the pentagon, if AB were a diagonal, then it would connect two non-consecutive vertices. But in our case, AB connects points A and B, which are not part of the pentagon. So this is uncertain. 

Alternatively, if point A is a vertex of the pentagon. But the pentagon's vertices are F, G, E, C, B. So A is not part of the pentagon. 

Hmm. This is getting too vague. Let me try to consider the given data again. 

We know that the pentagon is regular, and the circle is tangent to its sides (as per the tangent predicates). So if the circle is the incircle, then the radius r of the incircle is related to the side length s. For a regular pentagon, the apothem (inradius) is r = (s/2) * cot(π/5). 

Also, the length of AB is 84. If we can relate AB to the inradius or other parameters. 

But how? 

Let me think about the triangle ABC. If AB is 84, and CB is s, and if we can find the height from A to BC, then area of ABC is (base * height)/2. 

But without knowing the height, this is still stuck. 

Wait, but perhaps the circle mentioned in the predicates is the incircle of the pentagon. And the fact that the lines are tangent to it implies that the pentagon is tangential. But since it's regular, it is tangential. 

If the circle is the incircle, then its radius r is (s/2) * cot(π/5). 

But how does this help with finding s? 

Unless there's a relation between AB and the inradius. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABC is related to the circle. For example, if AB is a tangent to the circle, but the problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to the pentagon's sides, and point B is a vertex of the pentagon, then the circle is tangent to side BF and BC. So at point B, the circle is tangent to both BF and BC. This implies that the circle is tangent to two sides meeting at B, so the center of the circle lies along the angle bisector of angle B. 

But since the pentagon is regular, the angle at B is 108 degrees. The angle bisector would split it into two angles of 54 degrees. 

If the circle is tangent to both BF and BC, then its center lies along the bisector of angle B. 

But the circle is also the incircle of the pentagon, so its center is the center of the pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the center is equidistant from all vertices and lies at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. 

But in a regular pentagon, the incenter coincides with the circumcenter. So the center of the circle is at the center of the pentagon. 

So the center G is the center of the pentagon. 

Thus, in the pentagon, the center G lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. 

Now, since the circle is tangent to the sides, and its center is G, the distance from G to each side is equal to the inradius r. 

But how does this help us? 

Let me think about the triangle ABC. Point B is a vertex of the pentagon, and the circle is tangent to sides BF and BC at B. Wait, no—the circle is tangent to the sides of the pentagon, not necessarily at the vertices. For example, each side is tangent to the circle at one point. 

But in a regular pentagon, the incircle is tangent to each side at one point, and the center is G. 

Now, the distance from G to each side is r. 

But how to relate this to triangle ABC? 

Maybe the triangle ABC is formed such that AB is a tangent to the circle? Or some other relation. 

Alternatively, since AB = 84, and if AB is related to the inradius or the side length s, we can find s. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Pentagon is regular, so its area is (5/2)s²cot(π/5).
- AB = 84.
- Need to find s to compute both areas.
- Need to relate AB to s.

Possible approach: Assume that AB is a diagonal of the pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the length of a diagonal is φs. If AB is a diagonal, then 84 = φs => s = 84/φ. 

If this is true, then we can compute s, then compute the area of the pentagon, and the area of triangle ABC. 

But why would AB be a diagonal? Because if points A and B are non-consecutive vertices of the pentagon. But the pentagon has vertices F, G, E, C, B. So if A is another vertex, but it's not listed. 

Alternatively, if AB is a side of the pentagon. But then AB would be equal to s, so s = 84. 

But then, the area of the pentagon would be (5/2)s²cot(π/5), and the area of triangle ABC would depend on other factors. 

But without knowing more about triangle ABC, this approach is incomplete. 

Wait, perhaps triangle ABC is formed by three vertices of the pentagon. For example, if A is another vertex, but it's not part of the pentagon. 

Alternatively, if the pentagon is part of the triangle. For example, if points F, G, E, C, B are part of the triangle ABC. 

But with the given information, I'm not seeing a clear path. 

Let me try to make an assumption to proceed. Let's assume that AB is a diagonal of the pentagon, so AB = φs. Given AB = 84, then s = 84/φ. 

With this, I can calculate the area of the pentagon. 

Then, for triangle ABC, if it's an isoceles triangle with AB = 84, BC = s, and angle at B equal to 108°, then I can compute its area. 

Wait, if angle at B is 108°, then using the formula for area: (1/2)*AB*BC*sin(θ), where θ is the angle between AB and BC. 

So, if angle at B is 108°, then:

Area_ABC = (1/2)*AB*BC*sin(108°) 

Substituting AB = 84, BC = s = 84/φ, and φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618. 

Let me calculate this. 

First, compute s = 84 / φ ≈ 84 / 1.618 ≈ 51.9. 

Then, Area_ABC = 0.5 * 84 * 51.9 * sin(108°). 

Calculate sin(108°): sin(108°) = sin(180° - 72°) = sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. 

So Area_ABC ≈ 0.5 * 84 * 51.9 * 0.9511 ≈ 0.5 * 84 * 51.9 * 0.9511. 

Let me compute this step by step:

84 * 51.9 ≈ 84 * 52 = 4368, minus 84 * 0.1 = 8.4 → 4368 - 8.4 = 4359.6. 

Multiply by 0.9511: 4359.6 * 0.9511 ≈ 4359.6 * 0.95 ≈ 4141.62, plus 4359.6 * 0.0011 ≈ 4.7956 → total ≈ 4146.4156. 

Then multiply by 0.5: 4146.4156 * 0.5 ≈ 2073.2078. 

So Area_ABC ≈ 2073.21. 

Now, compute the area of the pentagon: (5/2)s²cot(π/5). 

First, π/5 radians is 36°, so cot(36°) ≈ 1.3764. 

Compute s²: (84/φ)^2 ≈ (51.9)^2 ≈ 2694. 

So area_pentagon ≈ (5/2) * 2694 * 1.3764 ≈ (2.5) * 2694 * 1.3764. 

First calculate 2694 * 1.3764 ≈ 2694 * 1.3764. Let me approximate:

2694 * 1.3764 ≈ 2694 * 1.3764 ≈ Let's break it down:

2694 * 1 = 2694

2694 * 0.3 = 808.2

2694 * 0.07 = 188.58

2694 * 0.0064 = ~17.24

Adding these: 2694 + 808.2 = 3502.2 + 188.58 = 3690.78 + 17.24 ≈ 3708.02

So total ≈ 3708.02

Multiply by 2.5: 3708.02 * 2.5 = 9270.05

So area_pentagon ≈ 9270.05

Then, shaded area = Area_ABC - Area_pentagon ≈ 2073.21 - 9270.05 ≈ negative number, which is impossible. 

This indicates a mistake in assumptions. Negative area suggests that the assumption that AB is a diagonal of the pentagon is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: Assume that AB is a side of the pentagon. So AB = s = 84. 

Then, Area_pentagon = (5/2)s²cot(π/5) = (5/2)*(84)^2*cot(36°). 

Compute cot(36°) ≈ 1.3764. 

So area_pentagon ≈ (5/2)*7056*1.3764 ≈ (2.5)*7056*1.3764. 

First compute 7056 * 1.3764 ≈ 7056 * 1.3764 ≈ Let's approximate:

7056 * 1.3764 ≈ 7056 * 1.3764 ≈ 7056 * 1.37 ≈ 7056 * 1.37. 

Breakdown: 7056 * 1 = 7056, 7056 * 0.37 = 7056 * 0.3 + 7056 * 0.07 = 2116.8 + 493.92 = 2610.72. Total ≈ 7056 + 2610.72 = 9666.72. 

Multiply by 2.5: 9666.72 * 2.5 = 24166.8. 

So area_pentagon ≈ 24166.8. 

Now, for triangle ABC, if AB = 84 and BC = s = 84, then it's an isoceles triangle with AB = BC = 84, and angle at B is 108° (since it's part of the pentagon). 

So area_ABC = 0.5 * AB * BC * sin(108°) = 0.5 * 84 * 84 * sin(108°). 

Calculate this: 0.5 * 7056 * 0.9511 ≈ 3528 * 0.9511 ≈ 3356. 

Then, shaded area = 3356 - 24166.8 ≈ -20810.8, which is still negative. Clearly, this is wrong. 

This suggests that my assumptions about the relationship between AB and the pentagon are incorrect. 

Alternative idea: Perhaps the triangle ABC is not related to the pentagon's sides directly, but rather, the shaded region involves overlapping areas. 

Wait, the shaded region is ABC - FGECB. So it's the area of triangle ABC minus the area of pentagon FGECB. But if the pentagon is entirely within the triangle, then the shaded area would be positive. 

But in our previous calculation, assuming AB is a side of the pentagon gave a large pentagon area, which is larger than the triangle area, leading to negative shaded area. This implies that the pentagon is not fully contained within the triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe the pentagon overlaps with the triangle, but the shaded region is the part of the triangle not overlapped by the pentagon. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Another possibility: The pentagon FGECB is partially outside the triangle ABC. But how? 

Given that points F, G, E are part of the pentagon, and B and C are common. If the pentagon extends beyond the triangle, then the shaded area would be the part of the triangle not covered by the pentagon. 

But without visualizing, it's hard to tell. 

Let me consider another approach. Since the problem involves a regular pentagon, and the circle tangent to its sides (incircle), and AB = 84. 

If I can find the inradius r of the pentagon, then maybe relate it to AB. 

For a regular pentagon, the inradius r = (s/2) * cot(π/5). 

Also, the length AB is 84. If AB is related to the inradius, but how? 

Perhaps AB is the distance between two points on the circle. For example, if A is a point on the incircle, but this is speculation. 

Alternatively, if AB is the length between two tangent points. 

Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to the sides of the pentagon, and the pentagon is regular, the distance from the center G to each side is r. 

If AB is a line from A to B, and if A and B are points where the circle is tangent to some lines, but this is unclear. 

At this point, I realize I'm missing crucial information. Perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption that the pentagon is regular. The problem says "assume the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated," so it is regular. 

Given that, and the presence of the circle tangent to the pentagon's sides, which implies it's the incircle. 

Let me focus on the inradius. For a regular pentagon with side length s, the inradius r = (s/2) * cot(π/5). 

Now, if AB is a line from A to B, and if this line is related to the inradius. For example, if AB is twice the inradius, or something like that. 

But without knowing the exact relationship, this is guesswork. 

Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to Line(F,G), Line(G,E), etc., and G is the center of the circle, then the distance from G to each of these lines is zero (since the lines are tangent to the circle). Wait, no: if a line is tangent to a circle, the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius. 

Wait, the circle is Circle(G), so its center is G. The lines FG, GE, EC, CB, BF are tangent to the circle. Therefore, the distance from G to each of these lines is equal to the radius of the circle. 

But since G is the center of the circle, and the lines are tangent to it, the distance from G to each line is equal to the radius r. 

Now, let's take Line(F,G). This line passes through G, so the distance from G to this line is zero. But the line is supposed to be tangent to the circle, which would require the distance from G to the line to be equal to the radius. This is a contradiction unless r = 0, which is impossible. 

Ah! Here's the key mistake: The predicate says Tangent(Line(F,G), Circle(G)), which implies that the line is tangent to the circle. But if the line passes through the center G, then it cannot be tangent to the circle unless the circle has zero radius, which is impossible. 

This indicates a fundamental error in the problem's predicates, or in my understanding of them. 

Re-examining the predicates: 

- Circle(G): So the circle is centered at G. 
- Tangent(Line(F,G), Circle(G)): The line FG is tangent to the circle centered at G. 

But line FG passes through G, so it contains the center. A line containing the center of a circle cannot be tangent to it—it would intersect the circle at two points (if the line is secant) or be a tangent if it touches at one point. But if the line passes through the center, it must intersect the circle at two points (unless the radius is zero). Hence, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there is an error in the problem's predicates, possibly a misinterpretation. 

Maybe the line is not FG, but another line. Let me check the predicates again: 

- Line(F,G) is one of the lines. 
- The predicates say Tangent(Line(F,G), Circle(G)), which would mean the line FG is tangent to the circle at G. But a line tangent at a point on the circle would mean that the line is tangent at G, which is on the circle. But if the circle is centered at G, then G is the center, not on the circle. Hence, this is impossible. 

This indicates that the problem's predicates contain inconsistencies, likely due to a misstatement. 

Given this impasse, perhaps the intended meaning is that the circle is the incircle of the pentagon, and the lines are tangent to it, but the center is not G. However, the predicate says Circle(G), so the center is G. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll need to make an educated guess based on standard problems. 

Assume that the pentagon is regular with side length s, and the circle is its incircle
