MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have three circles: A, B, and C. Their radii are given as 5, 15, and 5 units respectively. So the diameters would be double those, making them 10, 30, and 10 units. That aligns with the question statement mentioning diameters of 10, 30, and 10. 

Then there are points E, D, X, Y, Z, W. The line ED has several points lying on it: E, D, X, Y, Z, W. Also, points Z and W are on line ED. There are segments AZ and CW mentioned, with AZ being congruent to CW. And CW's length is given as 2 units. The question asks for ZX, so the distance between points Z and X along line ED?

Wait, but first, let me think about the tangents. The line ED is tangent to all three circles A, B, and C. Since a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. But since all three circles are tangent to the same line ED, maybe there's something about their centers' positions relative to ED?

But wait, how can a single line be tangent to three different circles? Unless they are arranged in some way where ED touches each circle once. However, with varying radii, their centers must lie at distances equal to their radii from the line ED. So the centers of A and C (radius 5) are 5 units away from ED, while center B (radius 15) is 15 units away. But since ED is tangent to all three, the centers must lie along the line perpendicular to ED at the points of tangency. Wait, but if all three circles are tangent to the same line ED, then their centers lie along lines perpendicular to ED at the tangent points. Therefore, the centers of A, B, and C are located at distances equal to their radii from ED, but in which direction? Are they all on the same side of ED, or could some be on opposite sides?

Assuming they are all on the same side of ED, then their centers are aligned such that each is offset from ED by their respective radii. However, if they are on different sides, the calculation would differ. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to infer based on other given info.

Now, looking at the points Z and W on ED. We know that segment AZ is congruent to segment CW, and CW is 2 units. Since AZ ≅ CW, AZ must also be 2 units. But AZ is a segment from point A (which is a circle, but wait—wait, hold on! Wait, the initial predicates mention Point(A)? Wait, the user wrote:

"Given Predicates:
Circle(A)
Circle(B)
Circle(C)
Point(A)
Point(B)
Point(C)
..."

Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, does that mean that A is both a circle and a point? Or is there a typo here? Because typically, in standard geometric terms, points are labeled with letters like A, B, C, etc., and circles might be named with the same letters or different ones. But according to the given predicates, there's a Circle(A) and Point(A). So A is both a circle and a point? Similarly for B and C? That seems odd, but perhaps that's part of the setup. Maybe each of A, B, C refers to both a circle and a point? For example, Point(A) might refer to a specific point associated with circle A, like its center?

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the predicates. But assuming that the problem uses the same labels for points and circles, perhaps each label represents both. For example, Circle(A) is a circle with center at Point(A)? Or maybe the center of Circle(A) is Point(A)? Wait, but then the Predicate Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(A)), 5) gives the radius. Then, if Point(A) is the center of Circle(A), then the distance from Point(A) to the tangent line ED should be equal to the radius of the circle. Since ED is tangent to Circle(A), the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to ED. Therefore, the center of Circle(A) lies along the line perpendicular to ED at the point where ED is tangent to the circle.

Similarly for Circles B and C. So, the centers of A, B, C are each at a distance equal to their radii from line ED, in directions perpendicular to ED. Now, considering that ED is tangent to all three circles, their centers are positioned such that each is at a distance equal to their radius from ED. So, if ED is horizontal, then the centers of A and C (radius 5) are vertically above ED, while the center of B (radius 15) is also vertically above ED. But since all three circles are tangent to ED, their centers are all on one side of ED.

But how do these centers relate to the points Z and W? Well, the points Z and W are on ED. Also, there are segments AZ and CW. Given that AZ ≅ CW, and CW is 2 units. So, the length of AZ equals the length of CW, which is 2. So AZ is 2 units long. Since A is a point (the center of Circle A?), then AZ is the distance from the center of Circle A to point Z on ED. Similarly, CW is the distance from the center of Circle C to point W on ED. But wait, if W is on ED, then the distance from Center C to W would be... Hmm, but if the center of Circle C is at a certain position, then the distance from Center C to W depends on where W is located on ED.

Wait, but perhaps I need to model this more concretely. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Let me assume that ED is a straight line. Let me consider coordinates. Let me set up coordinate system where ED is the x-axis. Let me denote line ED as the x-axis. Then, the y-coordinate of the center of each circle would be equal to their radius, since the line ED is tangent to them. So, for Circle A (radius 5), its center is at (h_A, 5), because the distance from the center to ED (x-axis) is 5. Similarly, for Circle C (radius 5), its center is at (h_C, 5). For Circle B (radius 15), center at (h_B, 15).

Now, points Z and W lie on ED (the x-axis). Let me denote point Z as (z_x, 0) and W as (w_x, 0). The segment AZ connects point A (center of Circle A) to Z. Since A is the center of Circle A, which is at (h_A, 5). So the length of AZ is sqrt[(z_x - h_A)^2 + (0 - 5)^2] = sqrt[(z_x - h_A)^2 + 25]. Similarly, the length of CW is sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + (0 - 5)^2] = sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + 25]. Given that AZ ≅ CW, so these two lengths are equal. Also, it's given that LengthOf(CW) is 2. So sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + 25] = 2. Squaring both sides: (w_x - h_C)^2 + 25 = 4 → (w_x - h_C)^2 = -21. Which is impossible unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, that can't be right. This suggests an inconsistency. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, the problem says that CW is a segment from point C to point W. Wait, earlier, the predicates say Segment(C,W). But if C is a circle, then how can there be a segment from C to W? Wait, the initial predicates have Point(C) and Circle(C). So perhaps C is both a circle and a point? Like, maybe Point(C) is the center of Circle(C)?

Yes, that makes sense. So Point(C) is the center of Circle(C). So, the segment CW is from the center of Circle C (point C) to point W on line ED. Therefore, the length of segment CW is the distance between point C (center of Circle C) and point W on ED. Since the center of Circle C is at (h_C, 5), and W is on ED (x-axis), so coordinates of W are (w_x, 0). Then the distance between (h_C, 5) and (w_x, 0) is sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + (0 - 5)^2] = sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + 25]. According to the problem, this equals 2. Therefore:

sqrt[(w_x - h_C)^2 + 25] = 2  
→ (w_x - h_C)^2 + 25 = 4  
→ (w_x - h_C)^2 = -21  

Which is impossible. So there must be an error in my assumptions. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the line ED is not just a tangent, but the circles are tangent to ED, so the distance from the center to ED is equal to the radius. However, if the line ED is tangent to the circle, then the center lies at a distance equal to the radius from ED. However, if the center is on the same side of ED as the tangent line, then the distance is positive. But maybe some circles are on the other side of ED? For example, if line ED is considered as a tangent, but the center of a circle could be on either side of ED. If that's allowed, then for some circles, the distance could be negative. But distance is always non-negative. So regardless, the square of the difference would still be positive. Hence, the equation (w_x - h_C)^2 + 25 = 4 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding of the setup.

Alternative possibility: Perhaps the line ED is not a tangent to the circles, but instead passes through their centers? No, the problem states that ED is tangent to all three circles. Alternatively, maybe ED is a common external tangent to all three circles. But how can a single line be tangent to three circles with different sizes?

Alternatively, perhaps the line ED is tangent to each circle at different points, but the centers are aligned in a particular way. Let me think again.

Another thought: The line ED is tangent to all three circles. Therefore, for each circle, the distance from its center to ED is equal to its radius. Thus, for Circle A (radius 5), the distance from its center to ED is 5; similarly for Circle B (radius 15), the distance is 15; and Circle C (radius 5), distance 5. Now, if all these centers are on the same side of ED, then their centers are at distances 5, 15, and 5 from ED. But how can a single line be tangent to all three circles? It depends on the arrangement of the circles. For instance, if the three circles are placed such that ED is a common external tangent. For example, imagine three circles arranged horizontally with ED as a horizontal line touching each of them externally. However, with varying radii, this requires careful placement.

But even then, the centers would be vertically above ED at their respective radii. So, suppose ED is horizontal. Centers of A and C are at (x1, 5) and (x2, 5), while center of B is at (x3, 15). The line ED is tangent to each circle, so the tangent points would be directly below each center, i.e., at (x1, 0), (x2, 0), and (x3, 0). However, the problem mentions points X, Y, Z, W on ED. These points might correspond to the tangent points. But the problem also includes points Z and W on ED. Additionally, there's a segment AZ and CW, which are congruent, with CW=2.

Wait, maybe points Z and W are the tangent points of the circles? For example, if Z is the tangent point for Circle A, then AZ would be the radius, so length AZ would be equal to the radius of A, which is 5. But the problem says that AZ is congruent to CW, which is 2. Contradiction. So that can't be.

Alternatively, points Z and W are somewhere else on ED. Let me think again.

Since the line ED is tangent to all three circles, and points Z and W are on ED, and segments AZ and CW are congruent. Given that AZ is from point A (which is the center of Circle A?) to Z on ED. Similarly, CW is from center of Circle C to W on ED. But if the center of Circle A is at (h_A, 5), then the length AZ is the distance between (h_A, 5) and Z (on ED, which is the x-axis). Let’s call Z as (z, 0). So AZ^2 = (z - h_A)^2 + (0 - 5)^2 = (z - h_A)^2 + 25. Similarly, for CW, center of Circle C is at (h_C, 5), and W is at (w, 0). So CW^2 = (w - h_C)^2 + 25. Given that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2, so AZ = 2. Therefore, (z - h_A)^2 + 25 = 4 ⇒ (z - h_A)^2 = -21. Again, impossible. So this suggests a fundamental flaw in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the points Z and W are not arbitrary points on ED, but specific ones related to the circles. For example, maybe Z is the point of tangency of ED with Circle A, and W is the point of tangency with Circle C. In that case, the distance from center A to Z would be the radius, which is 5. But the problem says that CW is 2, which contradicts that. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the segments AZ and CW are not from the centers to the points on ED, but from the points on ED to another point? Wait, the problem says Segment(A,Z). If A is a circle, then Segment(A,Z) is unclear. But earlier, we assumed that A is a point (since there's Point(A) in the predicates). So maybe A is both a circle and a point. For example, A is the center of Circle A. So, Segment(A,Z) is from the center of Circle A (point A) to point Z on ED. Similarly, Segment(C,W) is from the center of Circle C (point C) to point W on ED. So, if that's the case, then the previous equations apply. But the problem arises when trying to compute CW length as 2.

This suggests that my assumption about the positioning is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "Find Z X if A Z ≅ C W and C W = 2." So, ZX is the distance between points Z and X on line ED. Given that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2, find ZX.

Perhaps I need to consider the positions of Z and X relative to other points on ED. Let me think about the points on ED: E, D, X, Y, Z, W. All these points lie on ED. So ED is a straight line with multiple points on it. The problem involves finding the distance between Z and X. To find ZX, I need to determine the positions of Z and X along ED.

But how can I find their positions? Maybe using the given congruence and the fact that CW = 2.

Let me consider the following approach. Since ED is tangent to all three circles, and points Z and W are on ED, and segments AZ and CW are congruent, with CW = 2. Let me assume that A is the center of Circle A, and C is the center of Circle C. Then AZ is the distance from center A to Z on ED, and CW is the distance from center C to W on ED. As before, this leads to the equation sqrt((Zx - Ax)^2 + r_A^2) = CW = 2. But since r_A is 5, this would require sqrt((Zx - Ax)^2 + 25) = 2, which implies (Zx - Ax)^2 = -21, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the segment AZ is not from the center of A to Z, but from point A (a point on ED?) to Z? But the problem says Circle(A), so A is a circle. Wait, the predicates list Circle(A), Point(A), which suggests that A is both a circle and a point. This is confusing. Perhaps there's a mislabeling. Maybe the points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, etc., and the circles are named with the same letters? Or perhaps the circles are named differently?

Alternatively, perhaps the points E, D, X, Y, Z, W are points on ED, and A, B, C are circles whose centers are points. For example, the center of Circle A is Point A, the center of Circle B is Point B, and the center of Circle C is Point C. So, in that case, Point A is the center of Circle A, Point B is the center of Circle B, and Point C is the center of Circle C. 

With this understanding, let's re-express the problem. 

So, if ED is tangent to Circle A, Circle B, and Circle C, then the distance from each center (Points A, B, C) to line ED is equal to their respective radii. 

For Circle A (radius 5), the distance from Point A to ED is 5. Similarly, for Circle B (radius 15), the distance from Point B to ED is 15. For Circle C (radius 5), the distance from Point C to ED is 5. 

Now, Points Z and W are on ED. Segments AZ and CW are congruent. Given that CW = 2, so AZ = 2. 

Let me focus on segment CW. Point C is the center of Circle C, which is 5 units away from ED. Point W is on ED. So the length of segment CW is the distance between Point C and Point W. Since Point C is at a distance of 5 from ED, and Point W is on ED, the distance between C and W is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs being the vertical distance (5 units) and the horizontal distance between C's projection on ED and W. 

Let me denote the projection of Point C onto ED as Point P. Then, CP is 5 units. The distance from C to W is sqrt(PW² + CP²) = sqrt(PW² + 25). This equals 2. So sqrt(PW² + 25) = 2 → PW² = 4 - 25 = -21, which is impossible. Again, same issue. 

Hmm, this suggests that either the problem has a typo, or my interpretation is wrong. Let me check the original problem again. 

Wait, the problem says: "The diameters of ⊙A, ⊙B, and ⊙C are 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively. Find Z X if AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2."

Wait, maybe the segments AZ and CW are not from the centers to the line ED, but from the points on the line ED to another point? For example, maybe AZ is from point A to Z, where A is a point on ED? But the problem mentions Circle(A), so A is a circle. 

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in labeling. Let me try to look back at the predicates again:

Predicates include Circle(A), Circle(B), Circle(C), Point(A), Point(B), Point(C). So, for example, Point(A) exists, and Circle(A) exists. So, the circle A has a center, which may be Point A? Or is Point(A) a separate entity? 

Alternatively, maybe the points A, B, C are the centers of the circles A, B, C. So, Point(A) is the center of Circle(A), and similarly for others. If that's the case, then the earlier analysis applies, leading to the contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line ED is not tangent to the circles, but intersects them? But the problem explicitly states that ED is tangent to all three circles. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction. Maybe I need to revisit the problem's predicates for other clues. 

Looking back, there's a Predicate: PointLiesOnLine(Point(Z), Line(E,D)) and similarly for W, X, Y. So Z, W, X, Y are points on ED. 

Also, there's a Segment(A,Z) and Segment(C,W). If A is a point, then Segment(A,Z) is from A to Z. If A is a circle, then it's unclear. But since there's a Point(A), likely A is a point, and Circle(A) is a circle with center at A? 

Assume that. So, Point(A) is the center of Circle(A). Similarly, Point(B) is center of Circle(B), Point(C) is center of Circle(C). 

Then, Segment(A,Z) is from center of Circle A (Point A) to Z on ED. Similarly, Segment(C,W) is from center of Circle C (Point C) to W on ED. 

As before, the distance from Point A to Z is sqrt((Ax - Zx)^2 + (Ay - 0)^2). But since ED is tangent to Circle A, the distance from Point A to ED is equal to the radius of Circle A, which is 5. So, if ED is horizontal, and Point A is at (ax, 5), then the distance from Point A to ED is 5 units. 

But Z is a point on ED, so its y-coordinate is 0. So, the distance from Point A to Z is sqrt((Zx - ax)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt((Zx - ax)^2 + 25). This equals AZ. Given that AZ ≅ CW, and CW is given as 2. So sqrt((Zx - ax)^2 + 25) = 2. Which is impossible. 

This suggests that the problem may involve directed segments or absolute values, or that the line ED is not Euclidean? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the segment AZ. 

Wait, perhaps AZ is not from Point A to Z, but from Point A to some other point? Or maybe the segment is not straight? No, segments are straight. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line ED is not a straight line, but that contradicts the term "line". 

Alternatively, maybe the segments AZ and CW are not straight lines but arcs? But the problem says Segment(A,Z), implying a straight segment. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is not about the distance from the center to the line, but about something else. 

Wait, the line ED is tangent to all three circles. So, for each circle, there is a single point of tangency on ED. Let me denote the tangent points as T_A for Circle A, T_B for Circle B, and T_C for Circle C. 

These tangent points are points on ED. Now, if Z and W are among these tangent points? For example, Z is T_A and W is T_C? Then, the segment AZ would be the radius of Circle A, from center A to T_A, which is 5 units. But the problem says CW = 2, which would imply that the segment CW (from center C to T_C) is 2 units, but the radius is 5, so this is a contradiction. 

Unless the segment CW is not from center C to tangent point, but from tangent point to another point? 

Alternatively, maybe Z and W are points on ED such that AZ and CW are not radii but something else. 

Wait, the problem says "AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2". So, AZ = 2. If AZ is a segment from Point A to Z on ED, and it's length 2. But if Point A is the center of Circle A, then the distance from Point A to ED is 5, so the minimum distance from Point A to any point on ED is 5, so AZ cannot be shorter than 5. But the problem says AZ = 2, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in my assumptions. Let me consider alternative interpretations. 

Maybe the points A, B, C are not centers of the circles, but rather points on the circles? Or maybe the circles are named A, B, C, and the points are named separately? 

Wait, the problem mentions "Find Z X if A Z ≅ C W and C W = 2." So, Z and X are points on ED. The segment AZ is from A to Z, and segment CW is from C to W. If A and C are points on ED, then AZ and CW would be segments along ED. 

But then, if A and C are points on ED, and AZ and CW are segments along ED, then their lengths would be the distances between A-Z and C-W. But the problem says "AZ ≅ CW", so the lengths are equal. And CW = 2. 

But how does this connect with the circles? The problem also mentions that ED is tangent to all three circles. So, perhaps points A, B, C are points on ED, and the circles are somehow related to them? 

Wait, the initial predicates include Circle(A), so maybe Circle A is centered at point A? If A is a point on ED, then the circle A has center at A, and ED is tangent to it. For ED to be tangent to Circle A, the distance from A to ED must be equal to the radius of Circle A. But if A is on ED, then the distance from A to ED is zero, which would mean the radius is zero, which is impossible. 

Thus, this interpretation also fails. 

I'm running out of ideas. Maybe the key lies in recognizing that the line ED is tangent to all three circles, and points Z and W are the points of tangency. Let me assume that. 

If ED is tangent to Circle A at Z, then Z is the point of tangency. Similarly, if ED is tangent to Circle C at W, then W is the point of tangency. Then, AZ is the radius from center A to Z, so its length is 5. But the problem says CW = 2, which would mean the radius of Circle C is 2, but it's given as 5. Contradiction again. 

Wait, unless the segment CW is not the radius, but something else. Maybe it's a chord? Or maybe it's from point C to W, where W is not the point of tangency. 

Alternatively, perhaps the points Z and W are not the points of tangency, but other points on ED. Let me try to use the given that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2. Let's assume that AZ is a segment from A to Z, and CW is a segment from C to W, both having length 2. 

But without knowing the positions of A and C, this is difficult. However, since ED is tangent to all three circles, and points A, B, C are centers? Or are they points on ED?

Wait, the problem says "Point(A)", so Point A exists. If A is a point on ED, then the distance from A to ED is zero, but the circle A is tangent to ED, so the radius would be zero, which isn't possible. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem is referring to the circles as A, B, C, and points as E, D, X, Y, Z, W. Let me forget about the points A, B, C being centers. Let me treat them as circles, and the points as separate entities. 

So, there are three circles: A, B, C with radii 5, 15, 5. Line ED is tangent to all three circles. Points Z, W, X, Y, E, D are on ED. 

Segments AZ and CW are congruent, and CW = 2. Need to find ZX. 

If I consider the power of a point. For a point outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the power. But since ED is tangent to the circles, any point on ED would have a tangent length to the circle equal to the distance from the point to the circle's center squared minus radius squared. Wait, but for a point on the tangent line, the tangent length is zero, because the line is already tangent. 

Wait, for a point on the tangent line, the tangent length to the circle is zero, because the line itself is tangent. So, for any point on ED, the tangent from that point to Circle A would be zero. But how does this help?

Alternatively, maybe the points Z and W are related to the circles via some property. For example, if Z is the foot of the perpendicular from A to ED, but A is a circle, not a point. 

I think I need to take a different approach. Let me recall the answer choices are A. 3, B. 4, C. 5, D. 6. The problem involves circles with radii 5, 15, 5, and segments of length 2. Maybe the answer relates to the difference in radii or something similar. 

Since ED is tangent to all three circles, and points Z and W are on ED, and AZ ≅ CW with CW = 2. Let me imagine that AZ is a segment from a point A (maybe a point on ED?) to Z, and similarly for CW. Suppose that A and C are points on ED. Let me say that A is at some position on ED, and Z is another point on ED, such that the distance between A and Z is 2. Similarly, C is another point on ED, and W is another point on ED such that the distance between C and W is 2. But then, how does this relate to the circles being tangent to ED?

If the circles are tangent to ED, then their centers are at distance equal to their radii from ED. If A and C are points on ED, then their distance to ED is zero, so the circles would have zero radius, which is impossible. 

Wait, maybe the circles are tangent to ED at points Z and W? For example, Circle A is tangent to ED at Z, and Circle C is tangent to ED at W. Then, the radius of Circle A is the distance from its center to ED, which is equal to its radius. If Z is the point of tangency, then the center of Circle A is at distance 5 from ED, and lies along the line perpendicular to ED at Z. Similarly for Circle C. 

If that's the case, then the center of Circle A is at a distance 5 from ED, so if ED is horizontal, the center is 5 units above ED. Let's assume ED is the x-axis, and Z is at (z, 0). Then, the center of Circle A is at (z, 5). Similarly, for Circle C, if W is at (w, 0), its center is at (w, 5). 

Now, the segment AZ is from point A (which is the center of Circle A) to Z. Wait, if A is the center of Circle A, then A is at (z, 5), and Z is at (z, 0). So the segment AZ is vertical, length 5, which is the radius. But the problem says AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2. So if CW is from center C to W, which would be similar, giving length 5. But the problem says CW = 2. Contradiction again. 

Wait, unless the segment CW is not from the center to W, but from W to C? If W is on ED, and C is the center of Circle C, then the distance from W to C is the same as from C to W, which is 5. Still contradiction. 

This suggests that the only way for CW to be 2 is if the radius is 2, but the problem says it's 5. Hence, this indicates that my entire approach is flawed. 

Maybe the problem involves similar triangles or something else. Let me try to think about the configuration of the tangent line ED and the three circles. 

Since ED is tangent to all three circles, and the circles have radii 5, 15, and 5, their centers are at distances 5, 15, and 5 from ED. Let's assume they are on the same side of ED. Let me place ED as the x-axis. Let me denote the centers of the circles as follows: 

- Center of Circle A: (a, 5)
- Center of Circle B: (b, 15)
- Center of Circle C: (c, 5)

Now, the line ED is tangent to all three circles. The points of tangency on ED would be directly below each center. So, for Circle A, the point of tangency is (a, 0); for Circle B, (b, 0); for Circle C, (c, 0). 

Now, the points Z and W are on ED. Let's say Z is the point of tangency for Circle A, so Z is (a, 0). Similarly, if W is the point of tangency for Circle C, then W is (c, 0). Then, the segment AZ is from (a, 5) to (a, 0), which has length 5. Similarly, segment CW is from (c, 5) to (c, 0), also length 5. But the problem says CW = 2, which contradicts. 

However, if Z and W are not the points of tangency, but other points on ED, then the length of AZ and CW would depend on their positions. 

Suppose Z is a general point on ED, say at (z, 0). Then, the distance from A (at (a, 5)) to Z is sqrt((z - a)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt((z-a)^2 + 25). Similarly, if W is at (w, 0), then CW is sqrt((w - c)^2 + 25). Given that AZ = CW = 2, we have:

sqrt((z-a)^2 + 25) = 2 => (z-a)^2 = -21, which is impossible. 

This suggests that the only way this is possible is if the line ED is not tangent to the circles, but secant, but the problem states it is tangent. 

At this point, I must conclude that there is either a mistake in the problem or a misinterpretation. Given that the answer choices are numerical and likely small integers, let me try to think of a scenario where the distance ZX is one of these options. 

Let me assume that the line ED is tangent to all three circles, and the points Z and W are the points of tangency. Then, the distance between Z and X would depend on the positions of the tangent points. 

If the three circles are arranged such that their tangent points on ED are Z, X, W, Y, etc. Let me assume that the circles are arranged in order on ED. For example, if the circles are placed such that their points of tangency are spaced apart. 

But how to relate this to the given that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2? 

If Z is the point of tangency for Circle A, then AZ is the radius, 5. But the problem says AZ = 2. So this is inconsistent. 

Wait, maybe AZ is not the radius but a segment from A to Z, where A is a different point? 

If A is a point on ED, and Z is another point on ED, then AZ is a segment along ED, length |Z - A|. If this is equal to CW, which is 2, then AZ = 2. But how does this relate to the circles? 

Maybe the circles are positioned such that their centers are at distances from ED, and the points A and C are chosen such that the distance from A to Z and from C to W are 2. 

Let me consider that. Let's say A is a point on ED, and Z is another point on ED, such that the distance between A and Z is 2. Similarly, C is a point on ED, and W is another point on ED, such that the distance between C and W is 2. 

But how does this relate to the circles being tangent to ED? 

If the circles are tangent to ED, their centers are at distances equal to their radii from ED. If A is a point on ED, then the distance from A to the center of Circle A would be... Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the circles are positioned such that their centers are at points A and C on ED? But then the distance from A to ED is zero, so radius would be zero. 

This is going nowhere. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for patterns in the answer choices. The answer choices are 3, 4, 5, 6. Since the radii are 5 and 15, and the segment CW is 2, maybe the difference between radii or something similar. 

For example, if the distance between Z and X is the difference between the radii of B and A, which is 15 - 5 = 10, but that's not an option. Or maybe the sum of radii? 5 + 15 = 20. Not matching. 

Alternatively, since CW = 2, and AZ = 2, and if the circles are arranged such that the distance between Z and X is related to the radii. 

Wait, if ED is tangent to all three circles, and points Z and W are on ED, and AZ and CW are segments from the centers to ED, but the length of these segments is 2. But earlier calculation shows this is impossible. However, if the line ED is not tangent but secant, then the length would be different. But the problem says it is tangent. 

Maybe the problem involves the length of the tangent from a point to the circle. For example, if Z is a point on ED, and the tangent from Z to Circle A is 2. But ED is tangent to Circle A, so the tangent from Z to Circle A would be zero if Z is on ED. 

Alternatively, if Z is outside the circle, the length of the tangent from Z to Circle A is sqrt( (distance from Z to center)^2 - r^2 ). But since ED is tangent to Circle A, the distance from Z to the center is sqrt( (horizontal distance)^2 + r^2 ), and the tangent length would be sqrt( (horizontal distance)^2 + r^2 - r^2 ) = horizontal distance. So, if the tangent length from Z to Circle A is 2, then the horizontal distance from Z to the center of Circle A is 2. 

But the center of Circle A is at distance r from ED, so if the horizontal distance from Z to the center is 2, then the distance from Z to the center is sqrt(2^2 + r^2). But this is the length of the segment from Z to the center, which would be AZ. So, if AZ is the length from Z to the center of Circle A, then it's sqrt(4 + 25) = sqrt(29), which is not 2. 

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to guess based on the answer choices. Since the radii are 5 and 15, and CW = 2, which is much smaller, maybe the distance ZX is the difference between the radii divided by something. For example, 15 - 5 = 10, divided by 5 gives 2, but not in the options. Or 15 - 5 = 10, and 10 - 2 = 8, not in options. 

Alternatively, since CW = 2, and AZ = 2, and if the circles are arranged such that the distance between Z and X is the difference in radii, but I don't see it. 

Wait, let me think about the tangent line and the circles. If ED is tangent to all three circles, and the circles have radii 5, 15, 5. Let's imagine the three circles are placed such that ED is a common external tangent. The distance between the centers of the circles would be related to their radii. 

For example, the distance between the centers of Circle A and Circle B would be 5 + 15 = 20, since they are externally tangent. But I don't know if they are externally tangent. 

If ED is a common tangent, then the centers are aligned in a way that the line connecting their centers is parallel to ED? No, the line connecting centers would be perpendicular to ED, since ED is a common tangent. Wait, if ED is a common tangent, then the line connecting the centers of two circles would be perpendicular to ED. 

So, if ED is horizontal, the centers of the circles are vertically aligned. For example, Circle A and Circle C have centers at (x1, 5) and (x2, 5), and Circle B at (x3, 15). The distance between the centers of Circle A and Circle C is |x1 - x2|, and since they are both at y=5, the line connecting them is horizontal. 

Now, if points Z and W are on ED, and segments AZ and CW are congruent, with CW = 2. Let me assume that Z is the point on ED such that AZ is 2. Since A is at (x1, 5), and Z is on ED (y=0), the distance from A to Z is sqrt((x1 - z_x)^2 + 25) = 2. Solving for (x1 - z_x)^2 = -21, which is impossible. 

This suggests that the only way this works is if the line ED is not a straight line, but this contradicts the problem statement. 

At this point, I think there must be an error in the problem setup, or perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation. Given that, and the answer choices, I'll make an educated guess. Since CW = 2 and AZ = 2, and the radii are 5 and 15, perhaps the distance ZX is the difference between the radii of B and A, which is 15 - 5 = 10, but that's not an option. Alternatively, 15 - 2 = 13, no. Or 5 - 2 = 3, which is option A. 

Given that, and the lack of better ideas, I'll choose option A: 3.
