Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have points A, B, C, D. Then there are several lines connecting these points: Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D), Line(C,D), Line(C,B), Line(D,B). So that forms various connections. Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(A,C,D), Angle(C,D,B), Angle(A,B,C), Angle(A,C,B), Angle(C,B,D), Angle(D,C,B). Also, some congruences: Congruent(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)), Congruent(Line(A,C), Line(C,B)), Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(D,B)). And two isosceles triangles: Isosceles(Triangle(A,C,D)) and Isosceles(Triangle(A,C,B)). Plus, some equality of angle measures: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,C))) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C))).

The question is to find the measure of angle CAD, which is ∠CAD. The options are A. 22, B. 44, C. 66, D. 92.

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Points A, B, C, D connected in certain ways. Let me note down the lines first. From point A, there are lines AB, AC, AD. Then from C, lines CD, CB. From D, DB. Also, line CB connects C to B, and DB connects D to B. So maybe points C and D are connected to B? Also, there's a line CD. 

So the structure seems like A is connected to B, C, D. Then C is connected to D and B. D is connected to B. So perhaps triangle ABC, ACD, and other triangles?

Now, looking at the congruences. Line AD is congruent to DC. So AD = DC. Also, Line AC is congruent to CB. So AC = CB. And Line AB is congruent to DB. So AB = DB. Wait, so AB equals DB? That suggests that triangle ABD has AB = DB, making it isosceles with base AD? Or maybe something else.

Also, there are isosceles triangles: Triangle ACD is isosceles. Since AD = DC (from the congruence), so in triangle ACD, sides AD and DC are equal. Therefore, angles opposite those sides would be equal. So angle at C (which is ∠ACD) and angle at A (∠CAD)? Wait, no. In triangle ACD, sides AD and DC are equal. So the triangle ACD has AD=DC, so the base is AC, and the two equal sides are AD and DC. Wait, but in a triangle, the equal sides correspond to the base angles. So if AD = DC, then the base angles would be angles at A and C. Wait, no. Wait, triangle ACD: vertices A, C, D. Sides: AD, DC, and AC. If AD = DC, then the triangle has two equal sides: AD and DC. Therefore, the base is AC, and the two equal sides are AD and DC. Thus, the base angles would be angles at A and C. Wait, angle at A is ∠DAC, and angle at C is ∠DCA. So those two angles are equal. But according to the given predicates, there's an equality: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,C))). Which translates to ∠CAD equals ∠DAC? Wait, ∠CAD is the same as ∠DAC, since they're the same angle. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, ∠CAD is the angle at point A between points C and D. So vertex at A, with segments AC and AD. So ∠CAD is the angle between CA and DA at point A. Similarly, ∠DAC would be the same thing. Wait, maybe the predicate is saying that ∠(C,A,D) is equal to ∠(D,A,C). But those are the same angle. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or maybe different notation. Wait, the predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,C))). So Angle(C,A,D) is the angle at A between C and D, which is ∠CAD. And Angle(D,A,C) is also the angle at A between D and C, which is the same as ∠CAD. So that equality is redundant? Unless there's a misunderstanding in notation. Maybe the angle notation is different. For example, Angle(C,A,D) is the angle at point A formed by points C, A, D. So yes, that's ∠CAD. Similarly, Angle(D,A,C) is the angle at A formed by D, A, C, which is the same as ∠CAD. So this equality is just stating that ∠CAD equals itself, which is trivial. Maybe that was intended to indicate another angle? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement? Alternatively, maybe there's more to it. Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Let me check again.

Alternatively, could the angle measures refer to different angles? Like, maybe Angle(C,A,D) refers to the angle at point A, but maybe the order is different. Wait, in standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(C,A,D) is angle at A between C and D. Similarly, Angle(D,A,C) is angle at A between D and C. These are the same angle. Hence, the equality is trivial. So maybe that's just reinforcing that ∠CAD is equal to itself, which doesn't add new info. Hmm. Perhaps that's a red herring, or maybe there's a typo. But maybe I should proceed.

Another equality given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C))). So Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at A between C and B, which is ∠CAB. And Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A between B and C, which is ∠BAC. Again, these are the same angle. So that equality is also trivial. So maybe these are meant to imply that some other angles are equal? Or perhaps there's confusion in notation. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different conventions for angle notation. For example, sometimes angles are denoted with three letters where the middle one is the vertex. So Angle(C,A,D) is indeed ∠CAD. So perhaps the given equalities are just confirming that these angles are equal, which is obvious, so they aren't providing new constraints. Maybe I need to focus on other parts.

Looking back at the congruences. We have:

Congruent(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)): AD ≅ DC.

Congruent(Line(A,C), Line(C,B)): AC ≅ CB.

Congruent(Line(A,B), Line(D,B)): AB ≅ DB.

So AB = DB, AC = CB, AD = DC.

So considering triangle ACD: AD = DC, so it's isosceles with legs AD and DC. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, AD and DC are sides of triangle ACD. So side AD is opposite angle C, and side DC is opposite angle A. Wait, in triangle ACD, vertices are A, C, D. So side opposite angle A is CD. Side opposite angle C is AD. Side opposite angle D is AC. So since AD = DC, then the angles opposite them are equal. Therefore, angle at C (opposite AD) equals angle at D (opposite DC)? Wait, no. Wait, AD is a side, so angle opposite to AD is angle at C. Because in triangle ACD, side AD is between points A and D. So the angle opposite AD is at point C. Similarly, DC is between D and C, so the angle opposite DC is at point A. Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle ACD:

- Vertex A: connected to C and D.

- Vertex C: connected to A and D.

- Vertex D: connected to A and C.

Therefore, sides:

- AC: between A and C.

- CD: between C and D.

- DA: between D and A.

So side AC is opposite angle D.

Side CD is opposite angle A.

Side DA is opposite angle C.

Given that AD = DC. So DA = DC. So DA is the length of AD, and DC is the length of DC. So DA = DC implies that in triangle ACD, sides DA and DC are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite those sides are equal. The side DA (AD) is opposite angle C (at point C), and DC (side DC) is opposite angle A (at point A). Therefore, angle at C (∠ACD) equals angle at A (∠CAD). Wait, that's interesting. So ∠ACD = ∠CAD. But from earlier, we had that ∠CAD equals itself, which was already given. But maybe that's not helpful yet.

Similarly, since AC = CB (from the congruence), triangle ACB has AC = CB, making it isosceles with base AB. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. In triangle ACB, AC and CB are equal. So the sides AC and CB are equal, so the angles opposite them are equal. The side AC is opposite angle B, and side CB is opposite angle A. Wait, in triangle ACB:

Vertices A, C, B.

Sides:

- AC: between A and C.

- CB: between C and B.

- BA: between B and A.

Therefore, side AC is opposite angle B (at point B). Side CB is opposite angle A (at point A). So if AC = CB, then angle at B equals angle at A. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠BAC. Wait, but ∠BAC is part of the angle at A. However, there's another given equality: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C))), which is again the same angle. So maybe that's indicating that ∠CAB equals ∠BAC, which is trivial. So again, not giving new info.

But perhaps combining these facts. Let me consider all the congruences.

First, AB = DB. So triangle ABD has AB = DB, making it isosceles with base AD. Therefore, angles at A and D are equal. Wait, in triangle ABD, sides AB and DB are equal. So the base is AD, and the two equal sides are AB and DB. Therefore, the base angles at A and D are equal. So ∠BAD = ∠BDA.

But how does this relate to other parts?

Also, AC = CB. So triangle ACB is isosceles with AC = CB. So ∠CAB = ∠CBA.

Additionally, AD = DC, so triangle ADC is isosceles with AD = DC, leading to ∠CAD = ∠ACD.

Let me try to mark all these angles. Let me denote variables for each angle.

Let me assign variables:

In triangle ACD, since AD = DC, then ∠CAD = ∠ACD. Let’s call ∠CAD = x. Then ∠ACD = x. The third angle in triangle ACD is ∠ADC. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:

x + x + ∠ADC = 180 → 2x + ∠ADC = 180 → ∠ADC = 180 - 2x.

Now, let's look at triangle ACB. Since AC = CB, then ∠CAB = ∠CBA. Let’s denote ∠CAB = y. Then ∠CBA = y. The third angle in triangle ACB is ∠ACB. Sum of angles:

y + y + ∠ACB = 180 → 2y + ∠ACB = 180 → ∠ACB = 180 - 2y.

Now, considering the entire figure. Let me see if I can relate these angles.

Looking at point A, which is connected to B, C, D. So angles around point A: ∠BAC, ∠CAD, and possibly others depending on how the lines connect. Wait, but the lines from A are AB, AC, AD. So at point A, the angles between these lines would be ∠BAC, ∠CAD, and maybe others if there are other lines, but I think the main ones are ∠BAC and ∠CAD, but wait, since AB, AC, AD are all connected to A, the total around point A depends on how many lines are present. Wait, but the problem mentions lines AB, AC, AD, so three lines from A. So at point A, there are three rays: AB, AC, AD. Depending on the arrangement, these could form angles. For instance, if we imagine point A with lines going to B, C, D. Suppose the points are arranged such that AB, AC, AD are all emanating from A, creating angles between them. For example, angle between AB and AC is ∠BAC, angle between AC and AD is ∠CAD, and angle between AD and AB would be another angle. But unless specified, maybe we need to consider the full angles around point A.

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. But perhaps we can use other information.

Also, there's the fact that AB = DB. So triangle ABD is isosceles with AB=DB. Therefore, ∠BAD = ∠BDA. Let me denote ∠BAD = z. Then ∠BDA = z. The third angle in triangle ABD is ∠ABD. Sum of angles:

z + z + ∠ABD = 180 → 2z + ∠ABD = 180 → ∠ABD = 180 - 2z.

Now, let's try to find relations between these variables.

Let me consider the angles at point C. From triangle ACD, we have ∠ACD = x. Also, in triangle ACB, ∠ACB = 180 - 2y. Now, point C is connected to A, B, D. So at point C, there are angles involving lines CA, CB, CD. For example, ∠ACB, ∠ACD, and ∠BCD. Wait, but how do these relate?

From the given, there's an angle called Angle(C,D,B), which is ∠CDB. Also, Angle(C,B,D) is ∠CBD. Let me check the given angles again. The angles listed include:

Angle(A,C,D): ∠ACD (as discussed)

Angle(C,D,B): ∠CDB

Angle(A,B,C): ∠ABC

Angle(A,C,B): ∠ACB

Angle(C,B,D): ∠CBD

Angle(D,C,B): ∠DCB

Wait, ∠DCB is the same as ∠BCD. So maybe there are relations between these angles.

Also, there's an angle mentioned in the congruence: ∠CDB (Angle(C,D,B)) and ∠CBD (Angle(C,B,D)).

Perhaps considering triangle CBD. Let me think about that.

But maybe I should look for cyclic quadrilaterals or other relationships.

Alternatively, let me try to consider the entire diagram. Given that AB = DB, AC = CB, AD = DC.

Since AC = CB, triangle ACB is isosceles with AC = CB. So point B lies somewhere such that CB = AC. Also, AD = DC, so DC = AD. And AB = DB.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Point A connected to B, C, D. Point C connected to B and D. Point D connected to B. Also, AD = DC, so triangle ADC is isosceles with AD=DC. So point D is such that DC = AD. And CB = AC. So AC = CB, so triangle ACB is isosceles with AC=CB. Also, AB=DB.

This seems complicated, but maybe there are overlapping triangles or other relationships.

Let me think about triangle ABD. AB=DB, so it's isosceles with apex at B. Therefore, angles at A and D are equal (∠BAD = ∠BDA). Also, since AB=DB, then the base angles are equal. So ∠BAD = ∠BDA.

But how does this connect to other parts?

Also, from triangle ACD, we had that ∠CAD = x, and ∠ACD = x.

In triangle ACB, ∠CAB = y, ∠CBA = y, and ∠ACB = 180-2y.

Now, let me consider point C. At point C, the angles are ∠ACD (which is x), ∠ACB (which is 180-2y), and possibly others. Let me think about ∠ACB. Since AC = CB, ∠ACB is the angle at point C between points A and B. Also, from triangle ACD, ∠ACD is x, which is the angle at point C between points A and D.

So, if I consider the straight line at point C, maybe there's a relationship between ∠ACD and ∠ACB. For example, if points B and D are on the same side relative to AC, then ∠ACD and ∠ACB could combine to form a larger angle.

Wait, suppose that at point C, the lines CB and CD are extending from AC. So, if we imagine point C with lines to A, B, and D. So, the angle between AC and CB is ∠ACB, and the angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD. If points B and D are on opposite sides of AC, then ∠ACB + ∠ACD would be 180 degrees. But if they are on the same side, then it's the difference.

But without a diagram, it's hard to tell. However, given that there's an angle named ∠CDB (Angle(C,D,B)), which is ∠CDB, and ∠CBD (Angle(C,B,D)), which is ∠CBD. These are angles in triangle CBD. So, in triangle CBD, angles at C, B, D.

Let me think about triangle CBD. It has angles ∠CDB, ∠CBD, and ∠DCB. The sum of these angles is 180 degrees. Also, from earlier, we know that ∠ACD = x, which is adjacent to ∠DCB. Wait, because ∠ACD is the angle at C between A and D. So if we consider point C, the angle between AC and CD is x. If we also have CB connected to point C, then the angle between CB and CD would be ∠DCB. So, depending on the position of B relative to AC and CD, the angle ∠DCB could be related to ∠ACB.

For instance, if B is positioned such that CB extends from C away from AC, then ∠ACB and ∠DCB may be supplementary or have some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple triangles that share angles which can be used to set up equations.

Let me try to write down equations based on the above observations.

From triangle ACD:

∠CAD = ∠ACD = x ⇒ ∠CAD = x.

Sum of angles in triangle ACD: 2x + ∠ADC = 180 ⇒ ∠ADC = 180 - 2x.

From triangle ACB:

∠CAB = ∠CBA = y ⇒ ∠CAB = y.

Sum of angles in triangle ACB: 2y + ∠ACB = 180 ⇒ ∠ACB = 180 - 2y.

Now, considering point A. The angles around point A would be ∠BAC (which is y), ∠CAD (which is x), and possibly another angle if there's another line, but since there are only three lines from A (AB, AC, AD), the sum of those angles should be 180 degrees if they are adjacent. Wait, but unless the points are colinear or something. Wait, assuming that points B, C, D are placed such that AB, AC, AD are all emanating from A, forming angles between them. So, for instance, if we imagine point A with three lines going to B, C, D, then the angles between AB and AC is ∠BAC = y, between AC and AD is ∠CAD = x, and between AD and AB would be another angle. But unless specified, the total of these angles would be 360 degrees if they are around the point. However, since the problem involves triangles and other structures, it's likely that the angles around point A are part of the triangles.

Alternatively, maybe the lines AB, AC, AD are arranged such that they form a sort of star shape, but without more info, it's tricky.

But let's consider the entire diagram. Since AB=DB, and AC=CB, AD=DC, perhaps there are some symmetries or reflections.

Let me consider triangle ABD: AB=DB, so it's isosceles with AB=DB. So the base is AD, and the two equal sides are AB and DB. Therefore, the base angles at A and D are equal. So ∠BAD = ∠BDA.

Let me denote ∠BAD = z. Then ∠BDA = z. The third angle in triangle ABD is ∠ABD = 180 - 2z.

Now, let's think about ∠BAD. This is the angle at point A between BA and DA. Which would be ∠BAD. But earlier, we had ∠BAC = y and ∠CAD = x. How does ∠BAD relate to these?

Assuming that points B, C, D are arranged such that from point A, the order is B, C, D, then ∠BAD would be the angle between BA and DA, which would include ∠BAC and ∠CAD if C is between B and D. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's ambiguous. However, since there's an angle ∠CAB = y and ∠CAD = x, and ∠BAD is the angle between BA and DA, which might be the sum of ∠BAC and ∠CAD if C is between B and D. So ∠BAD = ∠BAC + ∠CAD = y + x. Hence, z = y + x.

Similarly, ∠BDA is the angle at D between BD and DA. Let's consider triangle ABD. So ∠BDA = z. Also, from triangle ADC, we have ∠ADC = 180 - 2x. Now, point D is connected to C and B. So, ∠ADC is the angle at D between A and C. But ∠BDA is the angle at D between B and A. Are these angles related? Let me think.

At point D, there are lines DC and DA. Also, line DB connects to B. So, the angle at D between DC and DA is ∠ADC (from triangle ADC). Additionally, the angle at D between DA and DB is ∠ADB, which is part of triangle ABD. So, if we consider the angles at point D, they would be ∠ADC and ∠ADB, plus any others. Assuming that lines DC and DB are on opposite sides of DA, then ∠ADC + ∠ADB = 180 degrees. But this requires knowing the configuration.

Alternatively, since ∠ADC is part of triangle ADC, and ∠ADB is part of triangle ABD, which shares side DA. Let me try to express ∠ADB.

From triangle ABD, ∠BDA = z. So ∠ADB = z. Also, ∠ADC = 180 - 2x. If these two angles at point D are adjacent, then ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180 degrees. So z + (180 - 2x) = 180 ⇒ z = 2x. Hence, z = 2x. But earlier, we said that z = y + x. So substituting, 2x = y + x ⇒ y = x.

So from this, we get that y = x.

That's a useful equation.

Now, moving forward. Since y = x, we can substitute that into other expressions.

Let me recall that in triangle ACB, ∠ACB = 180 - 2y. Since y = x, this becomes ∠ACB = 180 - 2x.

Now, let's look at point C. At point C, we have angles involving lines CA, CB, CD. Specifically, ∠ACB (which is 180 - 2x), ∠ACD (which is x), and ∠BCD (which is ∠DCB). 

Assuming that the points are arranged such that angles ∠ACB and ∠ACD are adjacent, then ∠ACB + ∠ACD = ∠BCD. Wait, if we imagine that at point C, the lines CB and CD are on opposite sides of line CA, then ∠ACB (between CA and CB) and ∠ACD (between CA and CD) would add up to ∠BCD (between CB and CD). So:

∠BCD = ∠ACB + ∠ACD = (180 - 2x) + x = 180 - x.

But ∠BCD is also part of triangle CBD. In triangle CBD, the angles are ∠CDB, ∠CBD, and ∠BCD = 180 - x. 

Also, from triangle CBD, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. So:

∠CDB + ∠CBD + ∠BCD = 180.

We need to find expressions for ∠CDB and ∠CBD.

Let me analyze ∠CBD. This is the angle at point B between points C and D. Looking at triangle CBD, ∠CBD is one of its angles. Also, considering other triangles involving point B. For example, triangle ACB has ∠CBA = y, which is equal to x (since y = x). So ∠CBA = x. Also, from triangle ABD, we have ∠ABD = 180 - 2z. Earlier, we found that z = 2x, so ∠ABD = 180 - 2*(2x) = 180 - 4x.

Now, ∠ABD is the angle at point B between points A and D. But ∠ABD is composed of ∠ABC and ∠CBD, if points C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Let me assume that. So ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD. 

From earlier, ∠ABC is part of triangle ACB, which is ∠ABC = y = x. So:

∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD ⇒ 180 - 4x = x + ∠CBD ⇒ ∠CBD = 180 - 4x - x = 180 - 5x.

Thus, ∠CBD = 180 - 5x.

Now, returning to triangle CBD:

∠CDB + ∠CBD + ∠BCD = 180.

We have ∠CBD = 180 - 5x, and ∠BCD = 180 - x. Let's plug these in:

∠CDB + (180 - 5x) + (180 - x) = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB + 360 - 6x = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB = 180 - 360 + 6x = -180 + 6x.

But angles cannot be negative, so this implies that 6x > 180 ⇒ x > 30 degrees. So this gives us an expression for ∠CDB as 6x - 180.

Now, we need to find another expression for ∠CDB to equate and solve for x.

How can we find ∠CDB?

∠CDB is the angle at point D between points C and B. Let me consider triangle CDB. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to find this angle.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABD. We know that ∠BDA = z = 2x. Also, ∠BDA is the angle at D between B and A. But ∠CDB is the angle at D between C and B. So if we can relate these angles, perhaps via other triangles.

At point D, the angles around point D include ∠ADC (from triangle ACD), ∠ADB (from triangle ABD), and ∠CDB (from triangle CBD). Wait, if we imagine that at point D, the lines DA, DC, and DB meet. So the angles at D would be:

Between DC and DA: ∠ADC = 180 - 2x.

Between DA and DB: ∠ADB = z = 2x.

Between DB and DC: ∠CDB = ?

These three angles should sum up to 360 degrees if they are around point D. Wait, unless some of them are straight lines. But assuming general position, the sum of angles around point D is 360 degrees. So:

∠ADC + ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 360 degrees.

Plugging in the known values:

(180 - 2x) + 2x + (6x - 180) = 360.

Let me compute this:

180 - 2x + 2x + 6x - 180 = 360 ⇒ (180 - 180) + (-2x + 2x) + 6x = 360 ⇒ 0 + 0 + 6x = 360 ⇒ 6x = 360 ⇒ x = 60 degrees.

Wait, this gives x = 60 degrees. But let me verify this calculation again.

Breaking it down:

∠ADC = 180 - 2x

∠ADB = 2x

∠CDB = 6x - 180

Sum: (180 - 2x) + 2x + (6x - 180) = 180 - 2x + 2x + 6x - 180 = (180 - 180) + (-2x + 2x) + 6x = 0 + 0 + 6x = 6x = 360.

Yes, so 6x = 360 ⇒ x = 60 degrees.

So x = 60 degrees. But wait, earlier we had that x is ∠CAD, which is the angle we need to find. But the answer choices are A. 22, B. 44, C. 66, D. 92. 60 isn't among them. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm, this suggests x = 60 degrees, but none of the options are 60. Let me check my reasoning again.

Wait, let's go back. When I assumed that the sum of angles around point D is 360 degrees. However, if points C, B, and A are arranged such that some of the angles are on a straight line, this assumption may be incorrect. For example, if DC and DA are on a straight line, then ∠ADC would be 180 degrees, but that contradicts our previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe the configuration is such that some of these angles are not all distinct. 

Wait, let me re-examine the assumption that the sum of the angles around point D is 360 degrees. That's only true if the three lines DC, DA, and DB are non-collinear and form three separate angles around D. But if, for example, points C, D, and B are collinear, then some angles would overlap. However, given the presence of multiple lines and triangles, it's likely that they are not collinear. But perhaps there's another error in my reasoning.

Let me double-check the derivation for ∠CDB. Earlier, I said that in triangle CBD, ∠CDB = 6x - 180. But how did I arrive at that?

Earlier, I had:

In triangle CBD:

∠CDB + ∠CBD + ∠BCD = 180.

Where ∠CBD = 180 - 5x, and ∠BCD = 180 - x.

So plugging in:

∠CDB + (180 - 5x) + (180 - x) = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB + 360 - 6x = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB = 180 - 360 + 6x ⇒ ∠CDB = 6x - 180.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, assuming that the sum of angles around D is 360 degrees:

∠ADC + ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 360.

Which gave:

(180 - 2x) + 2x + (6x - 180) = 6x = 360 ⇒ x = 60.

So x = 60 degrees. But this is not among the answer choices. So either my reasoning is wrong, or there's a mistake in the assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the sum of angles around D is 360 is incorrect. Maybe there are fewer angles, or some of them are supplementary. For example, if DC and DB are on the same side of DA, then ∠ADC and ∠ADB could be supplementary, not adding to 360. 

Let me reconsider the angles at point D. There are lines DC, DA, and DB. So, three lines from D: to C, A, and B. So, the angles between DC and DA is ∠ADC = 180 - 2x. Between DA and DB is ∠ADB = z = 2x. Between DB and DC is ∠CDB. So, the sum of these three angles is indeed 360 degrees, assuming that the three lines are not overlapping. So the calculation seems correct. But why is x coming out as 60, which isn't an option?

Wait, perhaps there's an error in deriving ∠BCD = 180 - x. Let me revisit that.

Earlier, I thought that ∠BCD = ∠ACB + ∠ACD. But that assumes that ∠ACB and ∠ACD are adjacent angles forming ∠BCD. Is this valid?

At point C, if lines CB and CD extend from CA, then depending on the direction, ∠ACB and ∠ACD could be adjacent or not. For example, if CB and CD are on opposite sides of CA, then ∠ACB and ∠ACD would add up to ∠BCD. But if they are on the same side, then ∠BCD would be |∠ACB - ∠ACD|.

But without knowing the exact configuration, this assumption could be wrong. So maybe I made an incorrect assumption here.

Let me think again. At point C, the lines are connected to A, B, and D. So, ∠ACB is the angle between CA and CB. ∠ACD is the angle between CA and CD. So, if CB and CD are on opposite sides of CA, then ∠BCD (the angle between CB and CD) would be ∠ACB + ∠ACD. If they are on the same side, it would be |∠ACB - ∠ACD|. 

But since we arrived at a contradiction (x=60 not being an option), perhaps this assumption is incorrect. Let me try assuming instead that ∠BCD = |∠ACB - ∠ACD|.

So, if ∠ACB = 180 - 2x, and ∠ACD = x, then ∠BCD = |180 - 2x - x| = |180 - 3x|.

But this introduces absolute value, which complicates things. Let me try this alternative approach.

So, if ∠BCD = 180 - 3x (assuming that ∠ACB > ∠ACD), then in triangle CBD, we'd have:

∠CDB + ∠CBD + ∠BCD = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB + (180 - 5x) + (180 - 3x) = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB + 360 - 8x = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB = 180 - 360 + 8x = 8x - 180.

Then, using the angles around point D:

∠ADC + ∠ADB + ∠CDB = 360 ⇒ (180 - 2x) + 2x + (8x - 180) = 360 ⇒ 180 - 2x + 2x + 8x - 180 = 8x = 360 ⇒ x = 45 degrees.

Ah! Now x = 45 degrees, which is not among the answer choices either. Hmm, still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe ∠BCD = ∠ACB - ∠ACD = (180 - 2x) - x = 180 - 3x. Then, in triangle CBD:

∠CDB + ∠CBD + ∠BCD = ∠CDB + (180 - 5x) + (180 - 3x) = ∠CDB + 360 - 8x = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB = 180 - 360 + 8x = 8x - 180.

Same as before, leading to x = 45. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if ∠BCD = ∠ACD - ∠ACB, assuming ∠ACD > ∠ACB. Let's say ∠ACD = x, and ∠ACB = 180 - 2x. So if x > 180 - 2x ⇒ 3x > 180 ⇒ x > 60. Then ∠BCD = x - (180 - 2x) = 3x - 180.

Substituting into triangle CBD:

∠CDB + (180 - 5x) + (3x - 180) = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB + 180 - 5x + 3x - 180 = ∠CDB - 2x = 180 ⇒ ∠CDB = 180 + 2x.

Then, using angles around D:

∠ADC + ∠ADB + ∠CDB = (180 - 2x) + 2x + (180 + 2x) = 180 - 2x + 2x + 180 + 2x = 360 + 2x = 360 ⇒ 2x = 0 ⇒ x = 0, which is impossible.

So this approach leads to inconsistency.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the relationship between ∠ACB and ∠ACD might be incorrect. Perhaps I need to revisit how ∠BCD relates to ∠ACB and ∠ACD.

Let me think differently. Let's consider triangle ACD and triangle ACB.

Since AC = CB and AD = DC, maybe there's a reflection or rotation symmetry.

Suppose we reflect point B over the perpendicular bisector of AC to get point D. Or some other transformation. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, since AC = CB and AD = DC, perhaps triangles ACB and DCA are congruent or similar.

Wait, AC = CB, AD = DC. If we can find another side or angle to show congruency.

Alternatively, since AB = DB, maybe triangles ABD and something else are congruent.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Let me try to consider specific values.

Suppose x = 44 degrees. Let's test this. If x = 44, then y = x = 44.

Then, ∠ACB = 180 - 2x = 180 - 88 = 92 degrees.

∠BCD = ? Let's assume it's ∠ACB + ∠ACD = 92 + 44 = 136 degrees.

Then, in triangle CBD:

∠CBD = 180 - 5x = 180 - 220 = -40 degrees. No, that's invalid. So this shows that my earlier derivation was flawed.

Wait, earlier, I said ∠CBD = 180 - 5x. Where did that come from?

Earlier, I assumed that ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD. ∠ABD is 180 - 4x, and ∠ABC = y = x. So:

∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD ⇒ 180 - 4x = x + ∠CBD ⇒ ∠CBD = 180 - 5x.

But if x = 44, this gives ∠CBD = 180 - 220 = -40, which is impossible. So this indicates that my assumption about the decomposition of ∠ABD is incorrect.

What's wrong here? Let me re-examine the decomposition of ∠ABD.

∠ABD is the angle at point B between points A and D. This angle could be composed of other angles if there are intermediate points. For example, if point C lies on the line segment BD, then ∠ABD would be split into ∠ABC and ∠CBD. But if point C is not on BD, then this decomposition might not hold.

Ah! Here's the critical error. I assumed that ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD, which is only true if point C lies on the line segment BD. But there's no guarantee of that. So this assumption might be incorrect, leading to the inconsistency.

This means that my earlier derivation of ∠CBD = 180 - 5x is based on an invalid assumption. Hence, I need to find another way to determine ∠CBD.

Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider triangle ABD, where AB = DB. So it's isosceles with AB = DB. Let me denote AB = DB = k. Also, AC = CB = m, AD = DC = n.

From triangle ACD: AD = DC = n, so AC = m. From triangle ACB: AC = CB = m. From triangle ABD: AB = DB = k.

Now, let's consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points can help.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me choose coordinates such that calculations are easier.

Let me assume point A is at (0,0). Let me define point C along the x-axis. Let me say point C is at (c, 0). Since AC = CB, and AC = m, then point B should be located such that distance from A to B is equal to distance from C to B. Let me assume that point B is somewhere in the plane.

Also, AD = DC = n. So point D should be such that distance from A to D equals distance from D to C. So D lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC. Since AC is from (0,0) to (c,0), the midpoint is at (c/2, 0), and the perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x = c/2. So point D is somewhere on x = c/2. Let me denote D as (c/2, d).

Also, AB = DB. So distance from A to B equals distance from D to B.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates:

Let me set A at (0,0), C at (2a, 0), so that the midpoint of AC is at (a, 0). Then, the perpendicular bisector is x = a. Let me choose D at (a, b), so that AD = DC. Let's calculate AD and DC.

AD is the distance from A(0,0) to D(a,b): sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2).

DC is the distance from D(a,b) to C(2a,0): sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2). So yes, AD = DC, as required.

Now, AB = DB. Let me find coordinates for B such that AB = DB.

Let me denote B as (p, q). Then AB^2 = p^2 + q^2.

DB^2 = (p - a)^2 + (q - b)^2.

Setting AB^2 = DB^2:

p^2 + q^2 = (p - a)^2 + (q - b)^2.

Expanding:

p^2 + q^2 = p^2 - 2ap + a^2 + q^2 - 2bq + b^2.

Canceling terms:

0 = -2ap + a^2 - 2bq + b^2.

Rearranged:

2ap + 2bq = a^2 + b^2.

So this is the condition for point B lying on the perpendicular bisector of AD. Wait, but AD is from A(0,0
