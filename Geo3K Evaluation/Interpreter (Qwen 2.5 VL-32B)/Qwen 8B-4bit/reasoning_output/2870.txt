MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned. 

We have points A, B, C, E, and another point D. The lines mentioned are AB, BC, CA forming triangle ABC. Also, there are lines AE, BE, CE, so point E is connected to all three vertices of triangle ABC. That suggests that E is a common point connected to A, B, and C, possibly creating several smaller triangles within the main triangle ABC.

Now, looking at the angles provided. There are several angles listed:

- Angle(D, A, B) = 95 degrees
- Angle(C, A, B) = 33 degrees
- Angle(C, B, E) = 109 degrees
- Angle(E, B, C) = 24 degrees
- Then some others like Angle(B, A, E), Angle(A, E, B), etc. Wait, but the question asks for the measure of ∠2. Hmm, maybe ∠2 refers to one of these angles? But since the problem didn't specify which angle is labeled as 2, perhaps it's referring to one of the angles listed here. Let me check the answer choices again: options are 23, 24, 28, 33. So maybe ∠2 corresponds to one of the angles given here. But first, I need to figure out which angle is being asked.

Wait, the problem mentions "∠2" but doesn't specify which one. However, looking at the given angles, there's an angle called Angle(E, B, C) which is 24 degrees. That's one of the answer choices. Alternatively, maybe ∠2 refers to another angle. Let me think about the diagram.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, B, C form triangle ABC. Point E is connected to A, B, C. So E is inside or outside the triangle? Since there are angles involving E and B, C, etc., perhaps E is inside the triangle. For example, Angle(C, B, E) is 109 degrees. Let me note down all the angles given:

Given angles:

1. Measure of Angle(D, A, B) = 95°
2. Measure of Angle(C, A, B) = 33°
3. Measure of Angle(C, B, E) = 109°
4. Measure of Angle(E, B, C) = 24°
Also, there are other angles mentioned:

- Angle(B, A, E)
- Angle(A, E, B)
- Angle(C, E, B)
- Angle(E, C, B)

But the problem says to find the measure of ∠2. Maybe ∠2 refers to one of these. However, without knowing the labeling of the diagram, I need to deduce based on the given data.

First, let's focus on triangle ABC. We know two angles at vertex B. Wait, Angle(C, A, B) is 33°, which is angle at B between A and C? Wait, angle notation is typically written as Angle(vertex, point, point). So Angle(C, A, B) would be the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, no. Wait, standard notation for angle XYZ is the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So Angle(C, A, B) is the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, but that seems odd because if we have triangle ABC, then angle at A would be between BA and CA. But here, Angle(C, A, B) would be angle at A between C and B, which is indeed angle CAB. So angle at A is 33°, given as MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B))=33°. Wait, but also there's Angle(D, A, B)=95°, which would be the angle at A between D and B. So point D is somewhere such that when connected to A and B, forms an angle of 95°. Not sure yet where D is located.

Then, looking at other angles. For instance, Angle(C, B, E) is 109°, which is the angle at point B between points C and E. Similarly, Angle(E, B, C)=24°, which is the angle at point B between E and C. Wait, but wait—Angle(E, B, C) would be the angle at point B between E and C. But earlier, Angle(C, B, E) is also at point B between C and E. Are these two different angles? Or is there a mistake here?

Wait, angle notation: Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(C, B, E) is angle at B between C and E. And Angle(E, B, C) is also angle at B between E and C. Wait, those should be the same angle. But the measures are given as 109° and 24° respectively. That can’t be unless there’s a typo. Wait, maybe I misread the predicates.

Looking back at the given predicates:

Angle(C,B,E) has measure 109°, and Angle(E,B,C) has measure 24°. Wait, that would mean two different angles at point B: one between C and E (109°), and another between E and C (24°)? That doesn’t make sense. Unless there are two different angles at B. But that would imply that the sum of those angles is more than 180°, which is impossible in a typical triangle. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angle notation.

Wait, let me re-express all angles properly:

- Angle(C, A, B): This is the angle at A between points C and B. So angle CAB = 33°, as given.

- Angle(D, A, B): Angle at A between D and B. So angle DAB = 95°.

- Angle(C, B, E): Angle at B between C and E. So angle CBE = 109°.

- Angle(E, B, C): Angle at B between E and C. Which would be the same as angle CBE. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous measure. Unless there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, could Angle(E, B, C) be angle at C between E and B? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(E, B, C) is the angle at B between E and C. So that would be the same as angle CBE. But according to the given, angle CBE is 109°, and angle EBC is 24°, which contradicts. Therefore, there must be some error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the second angle is not at B. Wait, let me check again. Angle(E, B, C): the vertex is B, so yes, it's angle at B between E and C. But then why is its measure 24°, while angle CBE (same angle?) is 109°? That can't be. So this suggests that there's a contradiction unless there are two separate angles at B. But that's not possible unless there are multiple lines emanating from B. Let me check the lines involved.

Lines connected to B are BA, BC, BE. So from point B, there are three lines: BA, BC, and BE. Therefore, at point B, there are three rays: BA, BC, BE. Thus, the angles around point B would involve these rays. So the angles between BA and BC, BA and BE, and BC and BE. Wait, but the given angles mention angle CBE (which is between CB and BE) as 109°, and angle EBC (same as CBE) as 24°, which is impossible. So this indicates that either there's a typo in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting the angle notations.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not all at the same point. Let me recheck:

Angle(C, B, E): Vertex at B, sides BC and BE → angle CBE.

Angle(E, B, C): Vertex at B, sides BE and BC → same angle as above. So they should be equal. But the measures are given as 109° and 24°, which is a conflict. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. But assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the angle names.

Wait, maybe Angle(E, B, C) is actually the angle at point C between E and B? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(E, B, C) is at point B. So the only way this makes sense is if there are two different angles at B. But how?

Wait, perhaps one of them is the reflex angle? Like, the larger angle around point B. For example, if the angle between BE and BC is 109°, then the reflex angle would be 360° - 109° = 251°, but that doesn't align with the given 24°. Alternatively, maybe one angle is part of triangle ABC and the other is part of another triangle involving E. 

Wait, considering that E is connected to B, and there's also line BE. So from point B, we have BA, BC, and BE. So the angles around point B would be:

Between BA and BE: let's call this angle ABE.

Between BE and BC: angle EBC.

Between BA and BC: angle ABC.

So, angle ABC is composed of angles ABE + EBC. Given that angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. But if angle CBE (which is angle EBC) is 109°, and angle EBC (same angle?) is 24°, that can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps Angle(C,B,E) is angle at B between C and E, i.e., angle CBE = 109°, and Angle(E,B,C) is angle at C between E and B, which would be angle ECB. Wait, no. The notation Angle(E,B,C) would still be angle at B. 

This inconsistency suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem setup, but since I have to work with the given data, perhaps I need to consider that maybe one of the angles is not directly at B. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and one of the angles is meant to be at a different vertex.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(E, B, C) is angle at C between E and B. Let me double-check. If the angle is Angle(E, B, C), the vertex is B. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation, like Angle(X,Y,Z) represents the angle at Y between XY and YZ. So, for example, Angle(C,B,E) is the angle at B between CB and BE, which is angle CBE. Similarly, Angle(E,B,C) would be the angle at B between EB and BC, which is the same as angle EBC. Hence, same angle, but given as 109° and 24°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem. But since I need to proceed, perhaps I should assume that there was a mix-up in the angle labels. Maybe one of the angles is at a different vertex. For example, perhaps Angle(E,B,C) is at point C instead of B? If that were the case, then it would be angle BCE, which is at point C between B and E. That could make sense. Let me consider that possibility.

Assuming that Angle(E,B,C) is at point C, between E and B, making it angle ECB. Then, given that measure is 24°, and angle CBE (at B) is 109°, which would make sense. Let me go with that assumption for now, since otherwise the problem is inconsistent. So, proceeding under the assumption that Angle(E,B,C) is angle at C between E and B, i.e., angle ECB = 24°.

With that correction, let's try to analyze.

So, focusing on triangle ABC. We have angle at A (CAB) = 33°, as per Angle(C,A,B)=33°. Now, what about angle at B and angle at C?

In triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180°. So, if we can find angles at B and C, we can compute the third angle. But we need more info.

But there's also point E connected to A, B, C. Let's look at the other angles involving E.

Angle(C, B, E) = 109°, which is angle at B between C and E, i.e., angle CBE = 109°. Also, angle at C between E and B is angle ECB = 24°, as per Angle(E,B,C)=24°. So in triangle CBE, we have angle at B = 109°, angle at C = 24°, so the third angle at E would be 180 - 109 -24 = 47°. So angle BEC = 47°. 

Now, let's consider triangle ABE. We might need to find some relations here. Also, there's angle DAB = 95°, which involves point D. But where is D located? The angle DAB is at A between D and B. So D is a point such that AD is a ray starting at A, forming 95° with AB. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to say. However, maybe D lies on some line or relates to other elements. Perhaps D is on EC or another line? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD is involved. Since angle DAB is 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, then angle between DA and CA would be 95° - 33° = 62°? Wait, if angle CAB is 33°, and angle DAB is 95°, then depending on where D is, DA could be extending beyond AB or in some direction. 

Let me try to visualize. Suppose point D is somewhere such that when you connect AD, it creates angle DAB = 95°, which is larger than angle CAB (33°). That suggests that D is on the opposite side of AB relative to C. For example, if AB is horizontal, and C is above AB, then D would be below AB, creating a large angle at A.

However, without more information, it's challenging to place D precisely. But maybe D is related to other parts of the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADE or something else is formed. However, since the problem asks for ∠2, which isn't specified, but among the answer choices, 24° is present. Given that angle ECB is 24°, which was considered as part of triangle CBE, that might be the intended answer. However, the problem states to find ∠2, so maybe ∠2 refers to angle at E, or another angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠2 is angle AEB. Let me see. In triangle ABE, if we can find angles. 

We know angle at A is DAB = 95°, but angle CAB is 33°, so if D is such that AD splits angle CAB into two parts? No, because angle CAB is already 33°, and angle DAB is 95°, which is larger. So maybe D is not on AC but elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving D, A, B, and E. But without more info, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, since there's an angle at A of 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, perhaps the remaining angle between DA and CA is 95° - 33° = 62°, leading to some relationship. 

But maybe I need to focus on triangle ABE. Let me think. If I can find angles in triangle ABE, maybe I can use that. 

In triangle ABE, we have points A, B, E. We know angle at A is DAB = 95°, but that depends on where D is. Wait, but if D is not part of triangle ABE, then maybe angle at A in triangle ABE is different. This is getting confusing. 

Let me take stock. The key angles given are:

- At A: angle CAB = 33°
- At B: angle CBE = 109° (assuming that's correct)
- At C: angle ECB = 24°
  
From triangle CBE, as before, angle at E is 47°. 

Now, in triangle ABC, the angles at B and C are... Well, angle at B includes angle CBE (109°) and angle ABE. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC. If BE is a cevian from B to E, then angle ABC is split into angle ABE and angle CBE. So angle ABC = angle ABE + angle CBE. 

Similarly, angle at C in triangle ABC is angle ACB, which may be split into angle ECB (24°) and another angle if BE intersects AC. But since E is connected to C, maybe not. 

Wait, but if E is connected to C, then in triangle ABC, point E is connected to C, so line CE. Therefore, angle at C (ACB) is split into angle ACE and angle ECB (24°). So angle ACB = angle ACE + 24°. 

But to find angle ACB, we need more info. However, in triangle ABC, we know angle at A is 33°, and if we can find angle at B or angle at C, we can compute the rest. 

But how?

Let me think about triangle ABE. If we can find angles there. 

But for that, I need to know more about angles at B or E. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE. Let's suppose that. 

In triangle ABE, we have angles at A, B, and E. We know angle at A is angle DAB = 95°, but that's only if D is part of this triangle. Otherwise, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles involving point D. Since angle DAB is 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, the difference is 95° - 33° = 62°, which could be angle between DA and CA. If DA meets CA at some point, but without knowing where D is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe D is on line CE or another line. 

This seems too vague. Perhaps I need to focus on triangle CBE and other triangles. 

Earlier, in triangle CBE, we found angle at E is 47°. Now, if we can find other angles involving E. 

For example, looking at triangle ABE and triangle AEC. 

Alternatively, since E is connected to A, B, C, maybe considering triangle ABE and triangle CBE. 

Wait, but without more information about other angles, it's difficult. 

Wait, the problem gives several other angles:

Angle(B, A, E) — which would be angle at A between B and E. So angle BAE. 

Angle(A, E, B) — angle at E between A and B. 

Angle(C, E, B) — angle at E between C and B. 

Angle(E, C, B) — angle at C between E and B. 

But I think we've already used angle at C between E and B as 24°. 

So, let's try to list all known angles:

At point B:

- angle CBE = 109° (from Angle(C,B,E))
- angle ABE = ? 
- total angle at B (in triangle ABC) = angle ABC = angle ABE + angle CBE = angle ABE + 109°

At point C:

- angle ECB = 24° (from Angle(E,B,C) assuming corrected)
- angle ACE = ?
- total angle at C (in triangle ABC) = angle ACB = angle ACE + 24°

At point A:

- angle CAB = 33° (given)
- angle DAB = 95° (given)

Now, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180°:

angle at A (33°) + angle at B (ABC) + angle at C (ACB) = 180°

So, 33 + (angle ABE + 109) + (angle ACE + 24) = 180

Simplify:

33 + angle ABE + 109 + angle ACE + 24 = 180

Combine constants: 33 + 109 = 142; 142 + 24 = 166

Thus: 166 + angle ABE + angle ACE = 180 => angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°

Hmm, that's interesting. So the sum of angle ABE and angle ACE is 14°. 

Now, let's consider other triangles involving E. For instance, triangle ABE and triangle AEC.

In triangle ABE, angles are at A, B, and E. We know angle at A is angle BAE, which is part of angle DAB = 95°. Wait, if angle DAB is 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, then angle between DA and CA is 95° - 33° = 62°, assuming that DA extends beyond AB. 

But if angle BAE is part of angle DAB, then angle BAE = angle DAB - angle between DA and CA? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if D is a point such that AD is a line creating angle DAB = 95°, then angle between AB and AD is 95°, and angle between AB and AC is 33°, implying that AD is on the other side of AB relative to C. 

Therefore, in triangle ABE, angle at A (BAE) would be 95°, since D is along AD, and angle DAB is 95°. Wait, but that would mean angle BAE = 95°, but angle CAB is 33°, so if E is on the extension of AD, then angle BAE is part of angle DAB. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently. 

If angle DAB is 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, then the angle between DA and CA would be 95° - 33° = 62°, assuming that DA and CA are on the same side of AB. 

But if E is connected to A, B, and C, perhaps E is positioned such that AE is part of DA? Or not necessarily. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE has angle at A of 95°, which would make sense if D is on AE. 

Wait, if D is on AE, then angle DAB would be the same as angle EAB. So if angle DAB is 95°, then angle EAB is 95°. But angle CAB is 33°, which is the angle between CA and AB. So angle between CA and AB is 33°, and angle between EA and AB is 95°, meaning that EA is on the opposite side of AB from CA. So, in this case, angle between EA and CA would be 95° - 33° = 62°, which could be angle EAC. 

So in triangle AEC, angle at A is 62°, angle at C is 24°, and angle at E would be 180 - 62 - 24 = 94°. 

Wait, but earlier in triangle CBE, we had angle at E as 47°. So if there are two angles at E, 47° and 94°, that would suggest that point E is part of multiple triangles, but this might not be possible unless the angles are supplementary. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Let me recap:

If in triangle AEC, angle at A is 62°, angle at C is 24°, then angle at E is 94°. 

And in triangle CBE, angle at E is 47°, as previously calculated. 

These two angles at E (47° and 94°) would be adjacent if E is connected to A, B, and C. But that would imply that the total angle around E is 47 + 94 = 141°, leaving 360 - 141 = 219° for other angles, which seems unlikely. But without knowing the full configuration, it's hard to verify. 

However, if angle at E in triangle AEC is 94°, and angle at E in triangle CBE is 47°, then maybe there's a relation between these angles. For example, if line BE divides the angle at E into 47° and something else. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving E where these angles fit. 

But this is getting too speculative. Let me return to the equation from triangle ABC: angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°. 

If angle ACE is part of triangle AEC, and angle ACE = x, then angle ABE = 14° - x. 

But how to find x? 

In triangle AEC, if angle at A is 62°, angle at C is 24°, then angle at E is 94°, so x = angle ACE = 24°, but that would make angle ACE = 24°, and thus angle ABE = 14 - 24 = negative, which is impossible. So that can't be. 

Alternatively, if angle ACE is different. Let me denote:

Let angle ACE = y, then angle ABE = 14 - y. 

In triangle AEC, angles are:

At A: angle EAC = ?

At C: angle ACE = y

At E: angle AEC = ?

Sum to 180°. 

But to find angle EAC, we need more info. Earlier, I thought it might be 62°, but that was based on assuming DA and EA are related. 

Alternatively, if angle EAC is z, then in triangle AEC, z + y + angle AEC = 180. 

But without knowing z or angle AEC, this is stuck. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angles are:

At A: angle BAE = ?

At B: angle ABE = 14 - y

At E: angle AEB = ?

Sum to 180°. 

But again, missing info. 

This seems too tangled. Maybe I need to revisit the original assumptions. 

Earlier, I assumed that Angle(E,B,C) is at C, but if that's incorrect, then the initial problem has inconsistencies. But since the problem must have a solution, maybe I need to accept that angle at B between C and E is 109°, and angle at B between E and C is 24°, implying that the total angle at B is 109 + 24 = 133°, which would make sense if those are adjacent angles at B. 

Wait, if at point B, there are two angles: one between C and E (109°) and another between E and something else (like A?), totaling 133°. But in a typical triangle, the angle at B would be part of triangle ABC. Let me think: if from point B, there are lines BA, BC, and BE, then the angles around B would be:

- Between BA and BE: let's call this α
- Between BE and BC: β
- Total angle at B: α + β = angle ABC

But if β is 109°, and α is something else. However, the given Angle(E,B,C) is 24°, which would be angle at B between E and C, which is β = 24°, contradicting the earlier β = 109°. 

Unless there's a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the given angles:

The given predicates include:

- MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E)) = 109°
- MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)) = 24°

If Angle(C,B,E) is at B between C and E, and Angle(E,B,C) is at B between E and C, they should be the same angle. Hence, the only way this makes sense is if one of the angles is a reflex angle. For example, if the angle between BE and BC is 109°, and the reflex angle (the larger angle around B) is 24°, but that doesn't make sense as reflex angles are greater than 180°. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are at different points. For example, Angle(E,B,C) is at point C, making it angle ECB = 24°, and Angle(C,B,E) is at point B, making it angle CBE = 109°. This would resolve the inconsistency, assuming that the second angle is at C. 

With this assumption, let's proceed. 

So, angle CBE = 109° (at B), angle ECB = 24° (at C). 

In triangle CBE, the angles are at B: 109°, at C: 24°, so angle at E is 180 - 109 - 24 = 47°. 

Now, returning to triangle ABC. Let's find angle at B and angle at C. 

Angle at B in triangle ABC is angle ABC. Since BE is a line from B to E, angle ABC is composed of angle ABE and angle CBE. So angle ABC = angle ABE + 109°. 

Similarly, angle at C in triangle ABC is angle ACB, which is composed of angle ACE and angle ECB (24°). So angle ACB = angle ACE + 24°. 

Now, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 33° (at A) + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180°. 

Substituting:

33 + (angle ABE + 109) + (angle ACE + 24) = 180

Which simplifies to:

33 + 109 + 24 + angle ABE + angle ACE = 180

Total of constants: 33 + 109 = 142, plus 24 is 166. So:

166 + angle ABE + angle ACE = 180 → angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°

Now, let's consider triangle ABE and triangle AEC. 

In triangle ABE, the angles are at A, B, and E. Let's denote angle at A as x, at B as angle ABE, and at E as y. So x + angle ABE + y = 180°.

In triangle AEC, angles at A, C, and E. Let's denote angle at A as z, at C as angle ACE, and at E as w. So z + angle ACE + w = 180°.

But we need to relate these variables. 

Additionally, we know from earlier that angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°. 

If we can find relations between x, z, y, w, we might find the answer. 

Now, let's think about point E. It is connected to A, B, and C. So, the lines AE, BE, and CE. 

Consider triangle ABE and triangle AEC. The angle at A in triangle ABE is angle BAE, and in triangle AEC is angle EAC. These two angles at A add up to angle BAC, which is 33°, because angle BAC is divided into BAE and EAC. 

Wait, if E is inside triangle ABC, then yes, angle BAC = angle BAE + angle EAC = 33°. 

So, angle BAE + angle EAC = 33°. 

Let me denote angle BAE = x, angle EAC = z, so x + z = 33°.

Now, in triangle ABE: x + angle ABE + y = 180°.

In triangle AEC: z + angle ACE + w = 180°.

Also, from earlier, angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°.

Now, we also have from triangle CBE: angle at E is 47°, which is angle BEC. 

But angle BEC is part of triangle BEC, and also, angle at E in triangle ABE and AEC might be related. 

Wait, angle at E in triangle ABE is y, and in triangle AEC is w. Are these angles related? 

If we consider point E, the angles around E would depend on how the lines intersect. If E is inside triangle ABC, then the sum of angles around E would be 360°. But we have several angles at E: 

- From triangle CBE: angle BEC = 47°
- From triangle ABE: angle AEB = y
- From triangle AEC: angle AEC = w
- And possibly other angles if there are more lines.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that E is inside triangle ABC, then the angles around E would be angle AEB, angle BEC, and angle AEC. Wait, no. If E is inside the triangle, the angles around E would be:

- Between EA and EB: angle AEB = y
- Between EB and EC: angle BEC = 47°
- Between EC and EA: angle CEA = w

So, the sum of these three angles should be 360°. 

Thus: y + 47 + w = 360 → y + w = 313°. 

But we also have from triangles ABE and AEC:

From triangle ABE: x + angle ABE + y = 180 → y = 180 - x - angle ABE.

From triangle AEC: z + angle ACE + w = 180 → w = 180 - z - angle ACE.

Adding these two equations:

y + w = 360 - x - angle ABE - z - angle ACE.

But x + z = 33°, and angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°, so:

y + w = 360 - (x + z) - (angle ABE + angle ACE) = 360 - 33 - 14 = 313°, which matches the earlier equation. 

So this checks out, but it doesn't give us new information. 

To find more relations, let's consider other triangles or lines. 

For example, in triangle ABE, if we can express y in terms of other variables. 

But without more information, it's still stuck. 

Wait, but we have angle DAB = 95°, which is angle at A between D and B. Assuming D is on line AE, then angle DAB would be the same as angle BAE, which is x. So x = 95°. 

If that's the case, then x = 95°, and since x + z = 33°, then z = 33 - x = 33 - 95 = -62°, which is impossible. So this suggests that D is not on AE. 

Alternative idea: maybe angle DAB is part of a different triangle. For example, if D is on line EC, then angle DAB would involve other lines. But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe angle DAB is part of triangle ABD, and we need to relate it to other angles. 

But without knowing where D is, it's challenging. However, since angle DAB is given as 95°, and angle CAB is 33°, the difference is 62°, which could be part of another angle. 

Maybe this 62° is angle DAC, leading to some relation. 

If I assume that D is on line AC extended, then angle DAC = 62°, making angle CAB = 33°, and angle DAB = angle DAC + angle CAB = 62 + 33 = 95°, which fits. 

So, if D is on the extension of AC beyond C, then angle DAB = 95°, and angle DAC = 62°. 

Now, with this, let's explore. 

If D is on line AC extended beyond C, then line AD passes through C. So, in this case, angle DAC = 62°, and angle CAB = 33°, which means that angle between DA and AB is 95°, as given. 

Now, with this, let's consider triangle ADC. But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since D is on AC extended, and we have point E connected to A, B, C, perhaps there's a way to relate angles. 

But I'm not seeing it immediately. 

Let me try to find angle ABE. 

Recall that angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°. 

If I can find one of these angles, I can find the other. 

Let me consider triangle AEC. In this triangle, angle at A is z = angle EAC = 33° - x, but x is angle BAE. Wait, earlier, if D is on AC extended, then angle BAE is part of angle CAB, which is 33°, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, if D is on AC extended, then line AD passes through C, and angle DAB is 95°. So, from point A, line AD goes through C, and then extends to D. So, angle between AB and AD is 95°, and angle between AB and AC is 33°, which implies that angle between AC and AD is 95° - 33° = 62°, as before. 

So, angle CAD = 62°, which is the angle between CA and AD. Since D is on line AC extended, this implies that AD is a straight line passing through C and D. 

Now, in this scenario, let's consider line AE. If E is connected to A and C, then line AE might intersect CD at some point, but without more info, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, let's consider triangle AEC. In this triangle, angle at A is angle EAC = 33° - angle BAE. Wait, no. If D is on AC extended, then angle EAC is part of angle EAD, but I'm not sure. 

This seems too indirect. Let me try to use the fact that angle ABE + angle ACE = 14°. 

Suppose angle ACE = y, then angle ABE = 14 - y. 

Now, in triangle AEC, angles are:

At A: angle EAC = let's say α

At C: angle ACE = y

At E: angle AEC = let's say β

So, α + y + β = 180°

Also, from earlier, angle EAC + angle BAE = 33°. 

If I can find α or β. 

But how? 

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE. Its angles are:

At A: angle BAE = let's say γ

At B: angle ABE = 14 - y

At E: angle AEB = δ

So, γ + (14 - y) + δ = 180°

Now, if I can relate γ and δ to other angles. 

But without more info, it's still stuck. 

Wait, but if D is on line AC extended, then line AD passes through C, and angle DAB = 95°, which is angle between DA and AB. So, angle BAE is part of this 95°. 

If E is somewhere such that line AE is part of line AD, then angle BAE would be 95°, but that would make angle BAE = 95°, and since angle CAB = 33°, then angle between EA and CA would be 95° - 33° = 62°, which is angle EAC = 62°. 

So, in this case, angle EAC = 62°, which would be α = 62°. 

Then, in triangle AEC, α = 62°, angle ACE = y, and angle AEC = β. 

So, 62 + y + β = 180 → y + β = 118°. 

Also, in triangle ABE, angle BAE = γ = 95°, angle ABE = 14 - y, and angle AEB = δ. 

So, 95 + (14 - y) + δ = 180 → δ = 180 - 95 -14 + y = 71 + y. 

Now, consider the angles at point E. As earlier, the sum of angles around E is 360°. 

At point E, we have:

- angle AEB = δ = 71 + y
- angle BEC = 47° (from triangle CBE)
- angle AEC = β = 118 - y

So, sum: (71 + y) + 47 + (118 - y) = 71 + 47 + 118 = 236°. 

But this should equal 360°, so 236° = 360°? No, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that our assumption is wrong. Where is the error?

Ah, the sum of angles around point E should be 360°, but in this case, it's only 236°, indicating that there are other angles at E. Perhaps there's another angle at E from another intersection? 

For example, if line ED is involved, but we don't have info about D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that angle BAE = 95° is incorrect. Because if D is on line AC extended, then line AD passes through C, and E is a point connected to A, B, C. So, if E is on line AD, then angle BAE would be the same as angle BAD = 95°. 

But in that case, angle BAE = 95°, leading to the earlier contradiction. 

This suggests that our assumption about the position of D is incorrect. 

Perhaps D is not on line AC. Maybe D is on another line. 

Alternatively, maybe D is on line BE. If D is on BE, then angle DAB would be part of angle BAE. 

But without more information, it's hard to proceed. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should focus on the answer choices. The question asks for ∠2, and one of the given angles is 24°, which is angle ECB (if that's the case). Since the answer choices include 24°, and this angle is given as 24°, it's possible that ∠2 refers to this angle. 

Alternatively, if the angle at E in triangle CBE is 47°, but that's not an option. The other given angles are 95°, 33°, 109°, and 24°. 

Since 24° is one of the options, and it's explicitly given as MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)) = 24°, which we initially thought was a contradiction but now assume it's at point C, making it angle ECB = 24°, which is a valid angle. 

Thus, the measure of ∠2 could be 24°, corresponding to choice B. 

Therefore, despite the confusion in the angle notations, the most plausible answer is B.
