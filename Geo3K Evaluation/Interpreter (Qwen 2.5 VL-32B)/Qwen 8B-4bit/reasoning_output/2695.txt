MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points M, N, L, P. There are lines connecting them: Line(M,L), Line(P,L), Line(M,N), Line(P,N). Also, there's an arc from M to P via N, so Arc(M,P,N). Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(M,N,L) and Angle(N,L,P). Additionally, it says RightAngle for both those angles, but wait, looking back, maybe I misread. Wait, the predicates say RightAngle(Angle(M,N,L)) and RightAngle(Angle(P,N,L)). So both angles at point N are right angles? Or maybe one of them?

Wait, the first part says:

RightAngle(Angle(M,N,L)): So angle at N between points M, N, L is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(P,N,L)): angle at N between points P, N, L is also a right angle. Hmm, so point N has two right angles? That seems odd unless the lines MN and PN are perpendicular to NL? Wait, but there are also perpendicularity conditions: Perpendicular(Line(M,N), Line(M,L)) and Perpendicular(Line(P,N), Line(P,L)). 

So Line(M,N) is perpendicular to Line(M,L). Which means that at point M, the lines MN and ML form a right angle. Similarly, Line(P,N) is perpendicular to Line(P,L), so at point P, lines PN and PL form a right angle. But how does this relate to the angles at N?

Let me sketch this mentally. Points M, N, L, P. Lines ML and MN are connected at M, forming a right angle. Similarly, lines PL and PN are connected at P, forming another right angle. Also, there are lines connecting L to N and P to N. So maybe N is connected to both L and P, making some structure.

Also, there's an arc from M to P through N, implying that N lies on the arc MP, so perhaps N is on the circumference of a circle passing through M, P, and maybe other points? But we also have a circle(N), which might mean that N is the center of a circle? Wait, the predicate says Circle(N), so maybe there's a circle centered at N? Not sure yet.

But focusing on angles first. The angles at N: Angle(M,N,L) and Angle(N,L,P). Both are right angles. So if I imagine point N, with lines going to M, L, and P. At N, the angle between NM and NL is 90 degrees, and the angle between NP and NL is also 90 degrees. Wait, but that would imply that NM and NP are both perpendicular to NL. Therefore, NM and NP are colinear? Because they're both perpendicular to the same line NL. Wait, but if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they must be parallel. However, since they both originate from N, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line, which isn't possible here. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Unless my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the angles are different. Let me re-examine. The first angle is Angle(M,N,L): this is the angle at point N between points M, N, L. So the vertex is N, with segments NM and NL. The second angle is Angle(N,L,P): vertex at N, between points L, N, P. So segments NL and NP. So if both these angles are right angles, then the angle between NM and NL is 90°, and the angle between NL and NP is also 90°. So combining these, the total angle around point N between NM and NP would be 90° + 90° = 180°, meaning that NM and NP are in opposite directions from N, i.e., collinear? But that would make N lie on the straight line connecting M and P? But then there's also lines connecting L to N and P to N, so maybe L is somewhere such that NL is perpendicular to both NM and NP?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration forms a rectangle or square? Let me think again.

Given that Line(M,N) is perpendicular to Line(M,L), so at point M, lines MN and ML are perpendicular. Similarly, at point P, lines PN and PL are perpendicular. Now, considering the angles at N being right angles. So, if at N, the angle between NM and NL is 90°, and between NL and NP is 90°, then NM and NP are both perpendicular to NL. Hence, NM and NP are both perpendicular to NL, meaning they are parallel to each other. But since they both start at N, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Wait, but NM and NP are different lines because they go to different points. This suggests that NM and NP are both perpendicular to NL, hence they are parallel to each other, but originating from N. So that implies that NM and NP are in the same direction relative to NL. Wait, but that's confusing. Maybe NL is a vertical line, and NM and NP are horizontal lines extending from N, but then the angles between NM and NL and between NP and NL would both be 90°, but NM and NP would be in opposite directions? For example, if NL is vertical, then NM could be to the left and NP to the right, both horizontal. But then the angle between NM and NP would be 180°, but that's not directly relevant here.

Now, the question asks for m∠L P, which is the measure of angle at point L between points P and ... Wait, the notation m∠L P. Wait, usually angle notation is ∠ABC for angle at B. So m∠LP would be ambiguous unless specified. Wait, the original question says "Find m \widehat L P." Oh, maybe it's an arc? Or maybe it's an angle. Wait, the user wrote "m \widehat L P", which in standard notation would represent the measure of arc LP. But given the presence of angles earlier, maybe it's an angle. Alternatively, maybe it's the measure of angle at L between points P and something else. Wait, perhaps there was a typo, and it should be m∠PLN or m∠PLM? Or maybe it's the measure of angle at P between points L and something else? But without more context, it's hard to tell. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question is written as "Find m \widehat L P." Given that earlier there was an Arc(M,P,N), which is an arc from M to P passing through N, so maybe this is an arc from L to P? Or maybe it's an angle? But the notation is unclear. However, given the answer choices are numerical, and the previous angles were given as measures like 36 and 78 degrees, it's likely that the question is about an angle measure. Perhaps the angle at point L between points P and another point? Wait, but where is the third point? Let me check again.

Looking back, the question is "Find m \widehat L P." In many contexts, the hat over LP would denote an arc, but since arcs are typically named with three points (like arc MLP), but here it's just LP. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the angle formed at point L by points P and another point. Wait, but the original problem may have had a missing point. Alternatively, maybe the notation is supposed to be m∠PLN or m∠PLM? Or perhaps it's a typo, and the intended question is m∠PNL or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the measure of the arc LP on a circle. Since there's a Circle(N) predicate, maybe the arc is on a circle centered at N?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the measure of angle at point L between points P and another point, such as N? Like angle NLP? But that would be m∠NLP. Alternatively, maybe the angle at point P between points L and another point? But without more info, it's challenging.

Wait, let me check the initial problem again. The user mentions the Arc(M,P,N), which is an arc from M to P passing through N, suggesting that N is a point on the arc. Also, there's a Circle(N), which could mean that N is the center of the circle. So the arc MP passing through N would be part of a circle centered at N. So the arc from M to P via N would be a semicircle if MP is a diameter. Wait, if N is the center, then the radius is NM = NP = r. So points M and P are on the circle, and N is the center. Thus, the arc MP would be 180 degrees if MP is a diameter, but if the arc passes through N, that would mean that N is the midpoint of the arc, which would require that the arc is 180 degrees. But then the measure of arc MP would be 180 degrees. However, the question is about m \widehat L P, which might refer to an arc from L to P. But without knowing where L is located, it's hard to tell. However, given that there are lines connecting L to N and others, perhaps L is on the circle as well?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to an inscribed angle. For instance, if there's a circle with center N, and points M, P, and L lying on the circle, then certain angles could be determined. But the presence of right angles at N complicates things.

Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

First, points M, N, L, P. Lines ML, MN, PL, PN. Also, lines LN and PN. Also, angles at N: Angle(MNL) is a right angle, and Angle(PNL) is a right angle. So at point N, the lines NM and NL form a right angle, and lines NL and NP form a right angle. So NM ⊥ NL and NP ⊥ NL, which implies that NM is parallel to NP because both are perpendicular to the same line NL. However, since both NM and NP start at N, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. This suggests that NM and NP are in opposite directions along the same line. Therefore, points M and P are aligned with N, such that NM and NP are in opposite directions. So N is the midpoint between M and P? Or maybe M and P are on opposite sides of N.

Additionally, the lines ML and PL are present. Since Line(M,N) is perpendicular to Line(M,L), which means that at point M, the line ML is perpendicular to MN. Similarly, at point P, Line(P,N) is perpendicular to Line(P,L), so PL is perpendicular to PN. 

So putting this together:

- Point N is connected to M and P, with NM and NP forming a straight line through N (since they are both perpendicular to NL).
- At point M, ML is perpendicular to MN, so ML is perpendicular to the line MN-P.
- Similarly, at point P, PL is perpendicular to PN, which is the same line as MN extended, so PL is perpendicular to the same line.

Therefore, ML and PL are both perpendicular to the line MN-P, which suggests that ML and PL are parallel to each other, as they are both perpendicular to the same line. Therefore, ML || PL.

Now, considering triangle MNL and PNL. Since angles at N are right angles, triangles MNL and PNL are right triangles. 

Moreover, since ML and PL are both perpendicular to the same line (MN-P), they are parallel. So ML || PL. 

Now, looking at the angles given: MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)) is 36 degrees. Wait, but earlier I thought that Angle(M,N,L) was a right angle. Wait, no! Wait, the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(M,N,L)) and RightAngle(Angle(P,N,L)), but then later it says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), 36) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,P)), 78). Wait, this contradicts the earlier RightAngle predicates. Wait, this must be a mistake in parsing. Let me double-check the original problem's predicates.

Original predicates:

RightAngle(Angle(M,N,L))
RightAngle(Angle(P,N,L))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), 36)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,P)), 78)

Wait, this is conflicting. The first two say that angles at N are right angles, but then the next two state that the measure of those angles is 36 and 78 degrees. That can't be true unless the problem is inconsistent. But that must be a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the RightAngle predicates are not applicable? Or maybe there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, looking back, the problem says:

"RIGHTANGLE(Angle(M,N,L))
RIGHTANGLE(Angle(P,N,L))"
and then 
EQUALS(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), 36)
EQUALS(MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,P)), 78)"

This is contradictory. How can an angle be both a right angle (90 degrees) and have a measure of 36 or 78 degrees? This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the predicates.

Wait, maybe the RightAngle predicates are not asserting that the angles are right angles, but rather that certain relationships hold. No, the standard notation for RightAngle(X) means that X is a right angle. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the predicates in a way that the first two are not assertions but parts of the definition. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the first two are not RightAngle but something else. Wait, checking the original input:

The user wrote:

"RightAngle(Angle(M,N,L))
RightAngle(Angle(P,N,L))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,L)), 36)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,P)), 78)"

Ah, I see. So the first two are stating that the angles are right angles, but then immediately contradicting that by saying their measures are 36 and 78. This inconsistency must be resolved. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the predicates are applied. Maybe the RightAngle is not for the angles themselves, but for the lines? Or maybe the problem is in a non-Euclidean geometry? Or perhaps it's a misprint.

Alternatively, maybe the RightAngle applies to the entire figure, not the individual angles. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the initial RightAngle predicates are not actual constraints but part of the problem's description, and the Equals statements are the actual given measures. That is, maybe the problem says that Angle(M,N,L) is a right angle and its measure is 36, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem statement. But assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps the RightAngle predicates are not meant to be taken literally. Maybe the user made a mistake in the input.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in 3D space, allowing for angles greater than 90 degrees, but even then, the contradiction remains. 

Wait, maybe the problem is using the term "RightAngle" incorrectly. For example, in some contexts, "RightAngle" might mean that the angle is a right angle, but in this case, the equals statements override that. But that doesn't make sense logically. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different convention where "RightAngle(A)" means that angle A is a right angle, and then the Equals statements provide additional information, but this would be contradictory. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup. However, since I need to proceed, I'll assume that the initial RightAngle predicates might be errors, and focus on the Equals statements instead. 

Assuming that the measures of Angle(M,N,L) is 36 degrees and Angle(N,L,P) is 78 degrees. Let's proceed with that.

So, Angle at N between M and L is 36 degrees, and angle at N between L and P is 78 degrees. Wait, but earlier, I thought that these angles were right angles, but now that's changed. Let me reset.

If Angle(M,N,L) is 36°, and Angle(N,L,P) is 78°, then at point N, the sum of these angles is 36 + 78 = 114°. But since the angles at point N are adjacent, they form a larger angle. However, without knowing the full context, it's hard to tell. But given that there are perpendicular relationships elsewhere, maybe there's a way to derive more information.

Also, there are lines ML and PL, which are perpendicular to MN and PN respectively. Let me consider triangles involved.

Since Line(M,N) is perpendicular to Line(M,L), triangle MNL is a right triangle at M. Similarly, Line(P,N) is perpendicular to Line(P,L), so triangle PNL is a right triangle at P.

Wait, if Angle(M,N,L) is 36°, then in triangle MNL, angle at N is 36°, and right angle at M. So the angles of triangle MNL would be: right angle at M (90°), angle at N (36°), so angle at L would be 180 - 90 - 36 = 54°. Similarly, for triangle PNL, Angle(N,L,P) is 78°, and right angle at P, so angle at N is 78°, angle at P is 90°, so angle at L is 180 - 90 - 78 = 12°.

Wait, but if both triangles MNL and PNL share the side NL, then the angles at L in each triangle would be 54° and 12°, respectively. But how do these relate? 

Alternatively, maybe the angles at L are supplementary? Let me visualize. If ML and PL are both perpendicular to MN and PN, which are aligned through N, then points M and P are on opposite sides of N. So, the line ML is perpendicular to MN, and PL is perpendicular to PN. Since MN and PN are in a straight line (because they are both perpendicular to NL?), or are they?

Wait, earlier confusion arose because of conflicting information, but let's try again. Assume that Angle(M,N,L) is 36°, and Angle(N,L,P) is 78°, and there are right angles at M and P.

In triangle MNL, right-angled at M, angle at N is 36°, so angle at L is 54°. In triangle PNL, right-angled at P, angle at N is 78°, so angle at L is 12°. These two angles at L (54° and 12°) are adjacent, forming a larger angle at L. So the total angle at L would be 54° + 12° = 66°. But what does this mean?

Alternatively, since ML and PL are both perpendicular to the same line (MN and PN, which are aligned), then ML and PL are parallel. So the figure might consist of two right triangles sharing a common side NL, with ML || PL.

Now, the question is to find m∠LP, which I'm still unsure about. But if the question refers to an angle at L between P and another point, like N, then it could be the sum of the angles from the two triangles, which is 54° + 12° = 66°, but that doesn't match any of the answer choices. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to an external angle or something else.

Wait, the arc mentioned earlier, Arc(M,P,N), suggests that points M, N, P are on a circle. If N is the center, then the arc MP would be a semicircle, but with the given angles, this might not fit. Alternatively, if N is on the circumference, but that's unclear.

Another possibility: the measure of angle at L, which we calculated as 66°, but none of the options match. Alternatively, maybe it's the angle at P? Or another angle.

Wait, the original question is "Find m \widehat L P." Assuming this is an arc measure, if points L and P are on a circle, then the measure of arc LP would depend on the central angle or inscribed angle. If N is the center, then the arc LP would be twice the inscribed angle subtended by LP. But without knowing where N is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if the arc is part of a circle with center N, then the arc from L to P would correspond to the central angle at N. The angle at N between L and P would be the central angle. But earlier, the angles at N were 36° and 78°, which might add up to 114°, which would be the measure of the arc LP. But the answer choices don't include 114, but option A is 114. However, the options are A. 114, B. 144, etc. So maybe the measure of the arc LP is 114°, which would make the answer A.

But why would the arc LP measure 114°? If points L and P are endpoints of an arc on a circle with center N, then the central angle would be the angle at N between L and P. But from earlier, we had Angle(M,N,L) = 36° and Angle(N,L,P) = 78°, which are angles at N between M-L-N and N-L-P. So the total angle at N between M and P would be 36 + 78 = 114°, which would be the central angle for arc MP. But if the question is about arc LP, then it depends on where L and P are. 

Alternatively, if the arc is from L to P passing through N, but that would require N to be on the arc, which would make the arc LP pass through N, implying that the central angle is the angle at N between L and P. But that angle would be the sum of the two given angles, which is 36 + 78 = 114°, leading to answer A. 

However, this assumes that the arc LP is the one that includes N, which might be the case given the Arc(M,P,N) predicate. So if the arc from M to P goes through N, then the arc from L to P might go through N as well, making the central angle at N between L and P equal to 114°, hence the measure of arc LP is 114°, matching option A.

But why would the arc LP be measured as 114°? It depends on whether N is the center of the circle. Earlier, there's a Circle(N) predicate, which likely means that N is the center. So if N is the center, then the arc LP would have measure equal to the central angle at N between L and P. To find that angle, we need to determine the angle at N between points L and P.

From the given, we have two angles at N: Angle(M,N,L) = 36° and Angle(N,L,P) = 78°. These are angles at N between M-L and between L-P. If we consider the total angle at N between M and P, it would be 36 + 78 = 114°, which would be the central angle for arc MP. But if we want the angle at N between L and P, that would be the angle between NL and NP. Wait, but how is that determined?

Earlier, we considered that NL is perpendicular to both NM and NP, implying that NL is perpendicular to the line MP (assuming M and P are aligned through N). But if that's the case, then the angle between NL and NP would be 90° minus the angle between NL and NM? Not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose N is the center of a circle, and points M, P, and L are on the circle. Then, the arc LP would be the central angle corresponding to the angle at N between L and P. To find this angle, we need to know the angle at N between L and P.

But from the given, we have two angles at N: between M and L (36°) and between L and P (78°). So the total angle from M to P through L would be 36 + 78 = 114°, which would be the measure of arc MP. But if the question is about arc LP, then we need to know the angle at N between L and P. However, the angle between L and P at N is not directly given. Wait, but if the lines NL and NP are connected to other points, maybe we can derive it.

Alternatively, since we have right angles at M and P, and the angles at N, perhaps we can use triangle properties.

In triangle MNL, right-angled at M, with angle at N being 36°, so angle at L is 54°. In triangle PNL, right-angled at P, with angle at N being 78°, so angle at L is 12°. These angles at L (54° and 12°) are adjacent, forming a larger angle at L. However, if we look at the angle at L between ML and PL, it would be 54° + 12° = 66°, but I'm not sure how this relates to the question.

But the question is about m∠LP, which could be interpreted as the angle at L between P and another point, but without clarity, it's challenging. However, if the arc LP is part of the circle with center N, then the central angle would be the angle at N between L and P. To find that, we might need to calculate it based on other angles.

Wait, if N is the center, then the angle at N between L and P would be the central angle for arc LP. To find this angle, we need to consider the positions of L and P relative to N. From the earlier angles at N, we have Angle(M,N,L) = 36° and Angle(N,L,P) = 78°, which are angles at N between M-L and between L-P. So the total angle from M to P through L is 36 + 78 = 114°, which would be the central angle for arc MP. But if we want the angle at N between L and P, that would be the angle between NL and NP. But how is this determined?

If NL is a line from N to L, and NP is a line from N to P, then the angle between NL and NP is the angle at N between L and P, which we need to find. However, we have the angles at N involving M and L, and L and P. If we consider the full angle around point N, it's 360°. But we only know two angles: 36° (between M and L) and 78° (between L and P). Are there other angles?

At point N, we also have the lines NL, NM, and NP. We already have two angles: one between M and L (36°), one between L and P (78°). What about the remaining angle? If there are other lines, like NL and NP, but we might need to consider the full circle.

Wait, if we imagine standing at point N, facing towards M, then turning 36° to face L, then turning another 78° to face P, what's the total turn from M to P? That would be 36 + 78 = 114°, leaving 360 - 114 = 246° for the rest. But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if there are other lines or angles at point N. For example, since ML and PL are perpendicular to MN and PN respectively, and MN and PN are in a straight line (since they are both perpendicular to NL), then NL is perpendicular to MN and PN, implying that NL is perpendicular to the line containing M and P. Therefore, NL is perpendicular to MP, and thus, the angle between NL and MP is 90°. 

But how does this help us find the angle at N between L and P? Let me try drawing this mentally.

Imagine line MP, with N somewhere off this line. NL is perpendicular to MP. At N, we have two angles: one between M and L (36°), and between L and P (78°). Wait, but if NL is perpendicular to MP, then the angle between NL and MP is 90°, so the angle between NL and MP is 90°. But how does that relate to the angles at N?

Perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around point N is 360°. We have the angle between M and L as 36°, and between L and P as 78°, and possibly other angles. If NL is perpendicular to MP, then the line NL is perpendicular to MP, so the angle between NL and MP is 90°. This might split the angles around N into parts.

But without a clear diagram, it's difficult to visualize. Let's consider that at point N, there are several angles. We know two of them: the angle between M and L is 36°, and between L and P is 78°. If NL is perpendicular to MP, then the angle between NL and MP is 90°, which might involve these angles.

For example, if MP is a straight line, and NL is perpendicular to it, then the angle between NL and MP is 90°. Let's suppose that M and P are on opposite sides of N, with NL perpendicular to MP. Then, the angle between NL and NM is 90°, and between NL and NP is also 90°, but this conflicts with the given angles of 36° and 78°. 

Wait, this brings us back to the earlier contradiction. If NL is perpendicular to MP, then the angle between NL and NM is 90°, but the problem states that Angle(M,N,L) is 36°, which would mean that the angle at N between M and L is 36°, not 90°. This suggests that my assumption about NL being perpendicular to MP is incorrect.

This indicates that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the given data, but since the problem exists, I must proceed under the assumption that the initial RightAngle predicates were incorrect and the Equals statements are accurate. 

Let me try to focus on the angles given: Angle(M,N,L) = 36° and Angle(N,L,P) = 78°. If these are the only angles at N, then the total angle at N is 36 + 78 = 114°, which would leave 360 - 114 = 246° for the remaining angles around point N. But without more information, this doesn't help directly.

However, if we consider that the question is asking for the measure of arc LP, and if N is the center of the circle, then the central angle for arc LP would be the angle at N between L and P. But we don't have that directly. However, if we can find that angle, it would give us the arc measure.

To find the angle at N between L and P, we might need to use the other information about the right angles at M and P. 

In triangle MNL, which is right-angled at M, with angle at N being 36°, so angle at L is 54°. In triangle PNL, right-angled at P, with angle at N being 78°, so angle at L is 12°. These angles at L (54° and 12°) are parts of the larger triangle or figure. If we consider the lines ML and PL, which are perpendicular to MN and PN respectively, and if MN and PN are aligned (as previously thought), then the lines ML and PL are parallel. 

If ML || PL, then the angles at L might form some relationship. For example, the angles at L in the two triangles (54° and 12°) could be related to the angle between ML and PL. 

But how does this help us find the angle at N between L and P? 

Alternatively, since ML and PL are parallel, and NL is a transversal, the alternate interior angles could be used. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky.

Wait, if ML is parallel to PL, and NL intersects both, then the angles formed by NL with ML and PL would be equal. But we know the angles at L in the triangles. 

In triangle MNL, angle at L is 54°, and in triangle PNL, angle at L is 12°. These are the angles between ML and NL, and between PL and NL, respectively. Since ML || PL, the angle between ML and NL (54°) and the angle between PL and NL (12°) should be supplementary if they are on the same side of NL. But 54 + 12 = 66°, which is not supplementary. This suggests a contradiction, indicating an error in assumptions.

This suggests that my current assumptions about the configuration are incorrect. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll make an educated guess based on the arc measure. If the angle at N between L and P is 114°, then the arc LP would measure 114°, matching option A. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, if the angle at N between M and P is 114°, and the arc MP is 114°, but the question is about LP, which might be supplementary or something else. 

Given the answer choices, and the calculation of 36 + 78 = 114, I'll go with option A.
