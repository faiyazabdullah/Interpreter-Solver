<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they connect. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have several Triangle predicates: Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(C,F,D), Triangle(B,F,D). Then there's Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D). Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all points. Lines connecting various points: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,A), Line(C,F), Line(F,B), Line(A,G), Line(G,C), Line(B,D). Also, RightAngle at Angle(A,G,C) and Angle(C,F,D). Lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 3) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 4). Perpendicular relationships between Line(A,G) and Line(B,C), and Line(C,F) and Line(B,D).

The question asks for m∠6. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention ∠6 directly. Maybe it refers to one of the angles formed by the intersecting lines? Or perhaps there's a diagram where ∠6 is labeled? Since we don't have the diagram, maybe ∠6 is referring to a specific angle mentioned in the predicates?

Let me think about the structure. The Quadrilateral A,B,C,D suggests that these four points form a quadrilateral. Also, there are triangles involving these points. For example, Triangle(A,B,C) would mean points A, B, C forming a triangle, and since they're part of the quadrilateral ABCD, that triangle would be half of the quadrilateral if it's a parallelogram, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the perpendicularity: Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). And Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). Also, there are right angles at Angles(A,G,C) and (C,F,D). So those are right angles. That means that certain lines are meeting at right angles, creating right triangles.

Also, the lengths: AB = 3 units and CD = 4 units. Since AB is part of the quadrilateral ABCD, and CD is another side. But without knowing the type of quadrilateral, it's hard to say. However, since there are right angles involved, maybe it's a rectangle or some other shape with right angles.

Wait, the RightAngle(A,G,C) implies that angle at point G between lines AG and GC is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(C,F,D) means angle at point F between CF and FD is a right angle. Also, the perpendicularly conditions: Line(A,G) ⊥ Line(B,C), so AG is perpendicular to BC. And Line(C,F) ⊥ Line(B,D), so CF is perpendicular to BD.

Hmm. Let's try to sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral. Let's assume ABCD is a quadrilateral with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Given that Line(C,D) has length 4, and Line(A,B) has length 3. Also, there are other lines like AF, BG, etc.

But maybe focusing on triangles first. Triangle(A,B,C): points A, B, C. Since AB=3, and BC is connected via Line(B,C). Also, Triangle(A,B,E) – so E is another point connected to A and B. Also, Line(D,E) connects D to E, and Line(E,A) connects E back to A, making a pentagon? Or maybe a star shape? Not sure yet.

But the main thing is to find angle 6. Since the answer options are numerical, and the choices are 25, 28, 35, 55, likely angle measures in degrees. Let me consider that angle 6 could refer to one of the angles in the triangles or quadrilaterals mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to angles formed by intersecting lines. Let me check the lines. There's Line(A,G) and Line(B,C) being perpendicular. So AG ⊥ BC. Also, Line(C,F) ⊥ Line(B,D). So CF ⊥ BD. 

Given that, maybe there are right triangles here. For example, Triangle(A,G,C) is a right triangle because of the right angle at G. Similarly, Triangle(C,F,D) is a right triangle at F. 

So, considering Triangle(A,G,C): right-angled at G. Therefore, AG and GC are legs, and AC is hypotenuse. Similarly, Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F, so CF and FD are legs, and CD is hypotenuse. Since CD is given as length 4, so FD^2 + CF^2 = CD^2 = 16. 

But also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). So BD is a line that is perpendicular to CF. Also, Line(B,D) is part of the quadrilateral? Because Line(B,D) is present. Wait, Line(B,D) is part of the structure. 

Additionally, Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). So AG ⊥ BC. Which suggests that AG is an altitude or something related to triangle ABC? Since Triangle(A,B,C) exists.

Now, trying to find m∠6. Assuming that ∠6 is one of the angles in the diagram. Let me think about possible angles. Since there are several right angles, maybe ∠6 is an acute angle in a right triangle. For instance, in Triangle(A,G,C), the angles at A and C would be complementary. Similarly for others.

But without seeing the diagram, I need to deduce based on the given info. Another thought: since there are multiple right angles and perpendicular lines, maybe there are similar triangles or some ratios that can be used. Also, the lengths AB=3 and CD=4. 

Another idea: since Line(A,B) is length 3, and Line(C,D) is length 4, and if ABCD is a trapezoid or something with those sides... Wait, but ABCD is a quadrilateral. If AB and CD are two sides, but without more info on the angles, it's tricky. But with the perpendicular lines...

Wait, Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate slopes and angles. Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates. Let's place point B at origin (0,0). Since Line(B,C) is horizontal or vertical? Well, if Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), then depending on the slope of BC, AG would have a slope that's negative reciprocal.

But maybe better to set up coordinate system. Let me choose coordinates such that point B is at (0,0). Let me suppose that Line(B,C) is along x-axis. So point B is (0,0), point C is somewhere along x-axis. Let's denote coordinates:

Let’s define coordinates:

Let’s take Point B at (0, 0).

Since Line(B,C) is a line. Let me assume that Line(B,C) is horizontal for simplicity. Then Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), so Line(A,G) is vertical. Since AG is vertical, and G lies on Line(A,G). Also, Line(A,G) connects A to G. 

Also, Line(A,B) has length 3. So distance between A and B is 3. Suppose Point A is somewhere. Since Line(A,G) is vertical, and passes through A and G. Let me suppose that Line(A,G) is vertical, so A and G share same x-coordinate. Let me assume that Line(B,C) is horizontal, so Line(B,C) is along x-axis. So point C is (c, 0) for some c > 0.

Then Line(A,G) is vertical. Let me say point A is (x, y) and point G is (x, z), since they lie on vertical line. But since Line(A,G) connects A to G, and Line(A,B) is from A to B(0,0). The length of AB is 3. So distance between A(x,y) and B(0,0) is sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 3.

Also, since AG is vertical, G is (x, k) for some k. Also, Line(G,C) connects G(x,k) to C(c, 0). But there's also a Line(G,C) mentioned. Also, there's a RightAngle at Angle(A,G,C), which is the angle at G between AG and GC. Since AG is vertical and GC goes from G(x,k) to C(c, 0). For this angle to be right, vectors GA and GC should be perpendicular.

Vector GA is from G to A: (x - x, y - k) = (0, y -k). Vector GC is from G to C: (c - x, 0 - k) = (c - x, -k). Their dot product should be zero:

GA • GC = (0)(c - x) + (y - k)(-k) = 0 -k(y - k) = 0 => -ky + k² = 0 → ky = k² → y = k, assuming k ≠ 0.

Therefore, y = k. So point A has y-coordinate equal to k, which is the same as G's y-coordinate. Hence, AG is vertical, from A(x,y) to G(x,y), wait no—wait, G is (x,k) and A is (x,y), so AG is vertical line segment from (x,y) to (x,k). So the vector GA is (0, y - k), and GC is (c - x, -k). We found that y = k. Therefore, point A is (x, k), and G is (x, k)? No, that would mean A and G are same point, which isn't possible. Wait, no—if y = k, then point A is (x, y) = (x, k), and point G is (x, k)? That can’t be unless A and G coincide, which they aren’t. Hmm, contradiction. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, the angle at G is between AG and GC. So vectors GA and GC emanate from G. Wait, the angle at G is between AG and GC. So the vectors would be from G to A and from G to C. So vector GA is (A_x - G_x, A_y - G_y) and vector GC is (C_x - G_x, C_y - G_y). 

Earlier, I considered GA as from G to A, which would be (A_x - G_x, A_y - G_y). But earlier, I had mistakenly written GA as (x - x, ...) which was incorrect. Let me redo that.

Let me re-express:

Let me fix coordinates again. Let me assume B is at (0,0), Line(B,C) is along x-axis. So point C is (c, 0). Point A is somewhere. Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), so vertical. So Line(A,G) is vertical. Thus, points A and G lie on a vertical line. Let me denote that vertical line as x = h. So point A is (h, a) and G is (h, g), since they are on the same vertical line. 

Distance AB is 3. AB is from A(h,a) to B(0,0): sqrt[(h)^2 + (a)^2] = 3 → h² + a² = 9.

Now, the RightAngle at Angle(A,G,C) means that angle at G between AG and GC is 90°. So vectors GA and GC are perpendicular. Vector GA is from G to A: (h - h, a - g) = (0, a - g). Vector GC is from G to C: (c - h, 0 - g) = (c - h, -g). 

Their dot product must be zero: (0)(c - h) + (a - g)(-g) = 0 → -g(a - g) = 0 → either g = 0 or a - g = 0.

Case 1: g = 0. Then point G is (h, 0), which is on the x-axis. But then Line(G,C) is from (h,0) to (c, 0), which is horizontal. But AG is vertical from (h,a) to (h,0), so AG is vertical. Then angle at G between AG (vertical) and GC (horizontal) is indeed 90°, which fits. So this case works.

Case 2: a - g = 0 → a = g. Then point G is (h, a), same y-coordinate as A. So Line(A,G) is vertical from A(h,a) to G(h,a), which is just a single point. Impossible. So Case 2 invalid. Hence, only Case 1 holds: g = 0. Therefore, G is (h, 0), same as point B? No, B is at (0,0). Unless h = 0, but then G would be (0,0), which is B. But that would make Line(A,G) from A(h,a) to B(0,0). But in that case, Line(A,B) is the same as Line(A,G), which may not be intended. Alternatively, h ≠ 0, so G is (h, 0), different from B.

Thus, G is (h, 0), lying on x-axis. Also, Line(G,C) connects G(h, 0) to C(c, 0), which is horizontal. So that gives us that Line(G,C) is along x-axis from (h,0) to (c,0). 

Now, looking at Line(G,C) and other elements. Also, there's a Line(A,G) which is vertical from A(h,a) to G(h,0). 

Also, there's a Line(A,G) which is connected to Line(B,C) (which is x-axis). Also, there's a Line(G,C), which is along x-axis from G to C. 

Now, moving to other parts. There's a Triangle(C,F,D) with RightAngle at F. So angle at F between CF and FD is 90°. Also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). So Line(C,F) ⊥ Line(B,D). 

Let me try to assign coordinates to other points. Let's consider point D. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral. From earlier, Line(C,D) has length 4. So distance between C(c, 0) and D is 4. Also, Line(C,D) is part of the quadrilateral. 

Assuming that ABCD is a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D. So order matters. If the quadrilateral is A-B-C-D-A, then Line(D,E) connects D to E, and Line(E,A) connects E to A. 

But maybe I need to consider other constraints. Let me think about Line(B,D). Since Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). So Line(B,D) has a slope that's negative reciprocal of Line(C,F)'s slope. 

First, let's find coordinates for F. Since Line(C,F) is connected to C(c, 0) and F. Also, Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F, so CF and FD are perpendicular. Also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). 

Let me attempt to find coordinates for F. Let me assume that Line(B,D) has some slope, and Line(C,F) has slope negative reciprocal. 

But without knowing coordinates of D, it's challenging. Let me think about Line(C,D): from C(c,0) to D, with length 4. Let me assume D is at (d_x, d_y), so that distance from C(c,0) to D(d_x,d_y) is 4. Also, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, D is connected to C and A? Or depends on the order. 

Alternatively, since Line(C,D) is a side of the quadrilateral, and Line(D,E) connects D to E, and Line(E,A) closes the shape. 

This seems getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the given right angles and perpendicular lines to find relations. 

For example, since Line(C,F) ⊥ Line(B,D), and Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F, so CF ⊥ FD. Therefore, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(F,D). Also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). Therefore, Line(B,D) is parallel to Line(F,D)? No, because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), and Line(C,F) is also perpendicular to Line(F,D), implying that Line(B,D) is parallel to Line(F,D)? That would mean Line(B,D) and Line(F,D) are the same line? Or that Line(F,D) is parallel to Line(B,D). But since they meet at D, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Therefore, Line(F,D) coincides with Line(B,D). So point F lies on Line(B,D). 

Because if Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), and Line(C,F) is also perpendicular to Line(F,D), then Line(F,D) must be parallel to Line(B,D), but since they meet at D, they must be the same line. Therefore, F lies on Line(B,D). 

So point F is on Line(B,D). Now, since Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F, then CF ⊥ FD. But FD is part of Line(B,D), so CF is perpendicular to Line(B,D). Therefore, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), which matches the given condition. 

So, putting it together, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), and F lies on Line(B,D). Therefore, Line(C,F) is the altitude from C to Line(B,D). 

Now, to find coordinates of F. Let me assume coordinates again. Let me try to proceed step by step.

Previously, I had:

- B at (0,0)

- C at (c, 0)

- Line(B,D) is some line. Let me denote D as (d_x, d_y). Then Line(B,D) goes from (0,0) to (d_x, d_y). 

Point F is on Line(B,D), so its coordinates can be parametrized. Let me write parametric equations. 

Parametrize Line(B,D): any point F on Line(B,D) can be expressed as t*(d_x, d_y), where t ∈ ℝ. 

Now, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D). The direction vector of Line(B,D) is (d_x, d_y). The direction vector of Line(C,F) must be perpendicular to this, so its slope is -(d_x/d_y) if d_y ≠ 0. 

But Line(C,F) goes from C(c, 0) to F(t*d_x, t*d_y). The vector CF is (t*d_x - c, t*d_y - 0) = (t*d_x - c, t*d_y). This vector must be perpendicular to the direction vector of Line(B,D), which is (d_x, d_y). Therefore, their dot product is zero:

(t*d_x - c)*d_x + (t*d_y)*d_y = 0  
→ t*d_x² - c*d_x + t*d_y² = 0  
→ t(d_x² + d_y²) = c*d_x  
→ t = (c*d_x)/(d_x² + d_y²)

Thus, coordinates of F are ( t*d_x, t*d_y ) = [ (c*d_x² / (d_x² + d_y²) ), (c*d_x d_y / (d_x² + d_y²)) ].

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to relate this to the fact that Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F. Since CF ⊥ FD, and F is on Line(B,D), then FD is part of Line(B,D), so FD vector is (d_x - t*d_x, d_y - t*d_y) = (d_x(1 - t), d_y(1 - t)). The vector CF is (t*d_x - c, t*d_y - 0) = (t*d_x - c, t*d_y). These two vectors must be perpendicular:

Dot product = (t*d_x - c) * d_x(1 - t) + (t*d_y) * d_y(1 - t) = 0  
Factor out (1 - t):

[ (t*d_x - c)d_x + t*d_y² ] * (1 - t) = 0  

Which gives either 1 - t = 0 → t = 1 (which would put F at D, but then CF would be CD, and FD would be zero vector, which doesn't make sense), or the bracket equals zero:

(t*d_x - c)d_x + t*d_y² = 0  
Expand:

t*d_x² - c*d_x + t*d_y² = 0  
Which is the same equation as before. Hence, consistent.

But this still leaves many variables. Perhaps I need to find relations between coordinates using other given data.

Recall that Line(C,D) has length 4. Distance between C(c, 0) and D(d_x, d_y) is 4:

√[(d_x - c)^2 + (d_y - 0)^2] = 4 → (d_x - c)^2 + d_y^2 = 16.

Also, Line(A,B) has length 3. Earlier, we had AB distance squared is h² + a² = 9, where A(h,a).

Additionally, there's Line(A,G) which is vertical from A(h,a) to G(h,0). So G is (h, 0). Also, Line(G,C) connects G(h,0) to C(c,0), which is horizontal. 

Now, there's also Line(A,G) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular. Wait, Line(B,C) is horizontal (from (0,0) to (c,0)), and Line(A,G) is vertical (from (h,a) to (h,0)). So they are already perpendicular, which checks out.

Now, what about other lines? Like Line(A,G) and Line(G,C)? Line(G,C) is from G(h,0) to C(c,0), so horizontal. Line(A,G) is vertical. So they meet at G at a right angle, which is already covered.

Now, what about Line(G,C)? It's from G(h,0) to C(c,0). So that's along x-axis from (h,0) to (c,0). 

Now, what about other lines? For example, Line(B,D) is from B(0,0) to D(d_x, d_y). Also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), as given.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to find relations between variables using the given lengths and other conditions.

Alternatively, let me consider that ABCD is a quadrilateral. If ABCD is a trapezoid, but with right angles. Let me think about the possibility that ABCD is a rectangle? But AB = 3 and CD = 4, which would not be a rectangle. Or maybe it's a kite? Not sure.

Alternatively, since there are right angles at G and F, maybe there are rectangles or squares involved. Let me try to think about the right angles.

At G: right angle between AG and GC. At F: right angle between CF and FD.

Maybe there are rectangles involving these points. For example, AGGC forms a right angle, so AG and GC are perpendicular. Similarly, CF and FD are perpendicular.

But without more info, it's challenging. Let me try to focus on finding angle 6. Since the answer choices are around 30 degrees, maybe it's an angle in a 3-4-5 triangle or something like that.

Wait, given AB = 3, CD = 4. If there are right triangles with these sides, maybe Pythagorean triples.

For example, in Triangle(A,G,C), which is right-angled at G. If AG and GC are legs, and AC is hypotenuse. If we can find AG and GC, then we can compute angles.

Similarly, in Triangle(C,F,D), right-angled at F, with legs CF and FD, and hypotenuse CD=4. So CF² + FD² = 16.

But how do we find CF or FD?

Alternatively, maybe Triangle(A,B,C) has some relation. Since AB=3, and BC is part of the quadrilateral. If ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB=3, BC=?, CD=4, DA=?

But without knowing BC or DA, it's difficult. However, since Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), and AG is a leg of the right triangle AGC.

Let me try to find AG and GC. In Triangle(A,G,C), right-angled at G, so AG² + GC² = AC². But AC is diagonal of quadrilateral ABCD. If I can express AC in terms of other known quantities?

Alternatively, if I can find coordinates for points A, B, C, D, etc., then compute the required angle.

Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me assume AB = 3. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let me take B at (0,0), and A at (0,3), making AB vertical. Wait, but then Line(A,G) would be perpendicular to Line(B,C). If Line(B,C) is horizontal, then Line(A,G) would be vertical. But if AB is vertical, then A is (0,3), and Line(A,G) would be vertical line through A, so G would be on that line. Let me try this setup.

Let me set:

- B at (0,0).

- A at (0,3), so AB is vertical, length 3.

- Line(B,C) is horizontal, so C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0.

- Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), which is horizontal, so Line(A,G) is vertical. Since A is at (0,3), Line(A,G) is the vertical line x=0. Hence, G is on this line, so G is (0, g) for some g.

But earlier, we had that in the right angle at G between AG and GC. So AG is from A(0,3) to G(0,g), which is vertical. GC is from G(0,g) to C(c,0). For angle at G to be right, vectors GA and GC must be perpendicular.

Vector GA is from G to A: (0 - 0, 3 - g) = (0, 3 - g).

Vector GC is from G to C: (c - 0, 0 - g) = (c, -g).

Their dot product is (0)(c) + (3 - g)(-g) = -g(3 - g) = 0 → -3g + g² = 0 → g(g - 3) = 0 → g = 0 or g = 3.

If g = 0, then G is (0,0), which is point B. But that would make Line(A,G) overlap with AB, which might not be intended. If g = 3, then G is (0,3), which is point A. Again, overlapping. So this suggests inconsistency. What went wrong?

Ah, because if Line(A,G) is vertical, and G is on that line, and we want the right angle at G between AG and GC, but in this setup, it leads to G being either A or B. Which suggests that my assumption of placing A vertically above B might not work. 

Alternative approach: Let me instead assume Line(B,C) is not horizontal. Let me try to assign coordinates differently.

Let me take B at (0,0). Let me assume Line(B,C) has some slope m. Then Line(A,G) is perpendicular to it, so slope -1/m.

Let me pick Line(B,C) to be arbitrary. Let me choose specific values to simplify calculations. Let me set B at (0,0), and C at (4,0), so that Line(C,D) has length 4. Wait, but CD is length 4, so if C is at (4,0), then D is somewhere such that distance from C(4,0) to D is 4. Let me say D is at (4,4), so CD is vertical, length 4. Then Line(C,D) is vertical. 

Now, Line(A,G) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). Since Line(B,C) is horizontal (from (0,0) to (4,0)), Line(A,G) is vertical. So A is somewhere on a vertical line, and G is on that same vertical line. 

Let me assume A is at (x, y), and G is at (x, k). Distance AB is 3: distance from A(x,y) to B(0,0) is √(x² + y²) = 3 → x² + y² = 9.

Now, RightAngle at G between AG and GC. Vector GA is from G(x,k) to A(x,y): (0, y - k). Vector GC is from G(x,k) to C(4,0): (4 - x, -k). Dot product is 0*(4 - x) + (y - k)(-k) = -k(y - k) = 0 → y = k or k = 0.

If k = 0, then G is (x, 0), which is on Line(B,C). Then Line(A,G) is vertical from A(x,y) to G(x,0). The right angle at G between AG (vertical) and GC (from G(x,0) to C(4,0), which is horizontal). So yes, this satisfies the right angle. So G is (x,0), and Line(A,G) is vertical from A(x,y) to G(x,0). 

Now, what about Line(G,C)? It's from G(x,0) to C(4,0), which is horizontal. 

Now, what about other points? Let's look at Line(C,F) perpendicular to Line(B,D). Let me find coordinates for D. Previously, I assumed D is at (4,4), making CD vertical. Then Line(B,D) is from B(0,0) to D(4,4), which has slope 1. Therefore, Line(C,F) must be perpendicular to this, so slope -1. 

Point F is on Line(B,D), which is y = x. So F is somewhere on y=x. Also, Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F. So CF ⊥ FD. Since Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), which has slope 1, so Line(C,F) has slope -1. 

Point C is at (4,0). Let me find point F on Line(B,D) (y=x) such that Line(C,F) has slope -1. 

Slope of CF: (y_F - 0)/(x_F - 4) = -1. But since F is on y=x, y_F = x_F. So:

(x_F - 0)/(x_F - 4) = -1 → x_F / (x_F - 4) = -1 → x_F = -x_F + 4 → 2x_F = 4 → x_F = 2. So F is at (2,2).

So F is at (2,2). Now, checking Triangle(C,F,D): C(4,0), F(2,2), D(4,4). Let's verify if it's right-angled at F.

Compute vectors FC and FD:

FC = C - F = (4-2, 0-2) = (2,-2)

FD = D - F = (4-2, 4-2) = (2,2)

Dot product of FC and FD: (2)(2) + (-2)(2) = 4 - 4 = 0 → Yes, they are perpendicular. So Triangle(C,F,D) is right-angled at F. Great!

Now, we've placed points B(0,0), C(4,0), D(4,4), F(2,2). Also, Line(A,G) is vertical line passing through A(x,y) and G(x,0). Let's find x and y such that AB = 3. 

AB is distance from A(x,y) to B(0,0): √(x² + y²) = 3 → x² + y² = 9. Also, Line(A,G) is vertical, so G is (x,0). 

Now, what about other points? There's a Line(A,G) and Line(G,C). Line(G,C) is from G(x,0) to C(4,0), which is horizontal. 

Also, there's a Line(A,G) which is vertical, and Line(B,C) is horizontal. They are perpendicular, as required.

Now, what about Point E? There's Triangle(A,B,E) and Line(D,E), Line(E,A). Let me think. Since D is at (4,4), and Line(D,E) connects to E, then Line(E,A) connects E to A. 

But we need to find m∠6. Assuming ∠6 is one of the angles formed by these lines. Let me see what angles we have.

In this coordinate system, let me try to identify all points:

Points:

- A: (x, y), with x² + y² = 9.

- B: (0,0)

- C: (4,0)

- D: (4,4)

- F: (2,2)

- G: (x, 0)

Also, Line(A,G) is vertical from A(x,y) to G(x,0). 

Now, what about Point E? Triangle(A,B,E) exists, so E is connected to A and B. Also, Line(D,E) connects D to E, and Line(E,A) connects E to A.

Let me find coordinates of E. Let me assume E is somewhere. Since Line(D,E) and Line(E,A) are present, E is the intersection of Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). But without more info, need to find E such that it forms Triangle(A,B,E).

Alternatively, since there's a Line(A,G), Line(G,C), and other lines, but I'm not sure. Let me think about other given lines. There's Line(A,G), Line(G,C), Line(B,D), etc.

Wait, there's also Line(A,G) and Line(G,C). In our current setup, Line(G,C) is from G(x,0) to C(4,0). 

Now, what about Line(A,G)? It's vertical from A(x,y) to G(x,0). 

Also, there's Line(A,G) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular, which we already satisfied.

Now, what about other lines? For example, Line(B,D) is from B(0,0) to D(4,4), which we've defined. 

Now, what about Point E? Let me assume E is determined by Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). Since Line(D,E) connects D(4,4) to E, and Line(E,A) connects E to A(x,y). To find E, we need more constraints. But perhaps there are other predicates. 

Wait, there's a Line(E,A) and Line(D,E). Also, there's a Line(E,A) which is part of Triangle(A,B,E). So E is connected to A and B. Wait, Triangle(A,B,E) implies that E is connected to A and B, so E is connected to both A and B. So Line(A,B) is already there, and E is a third point forming the triangle. 

But how to find E's position? Let me assume that E is somewhere such that it creates Triangle(A,B,E). Without more info, it's hard to determine. However, since Line(D,E) is present, E is connected to D. 

Perhaps E is the intersection of Line(D,E) and Line(E,A), but I need more constraints. Let me think if there are other given lines or predicates involving E.

Looking back at the given predicates:

- Line(D,E)

- Line(E,A)

- Triangle(A,B,E)

- Triangle(A,B,C) — already handled.

- Line(A,G)

- Line(G,C)

- Line(B,D)

- Line(C,F)

- Line(F,B)

- Line(A,G)

- Line(G,C)

- Line(B,D)

Wait, Line(F,B) is from F(2,2) to B(0,0). So Line(F,B) is from (2,2) to (0,0), which is the line y = x. 

Also, there's Line(F,B) and Line(C,F). Line(C,F) is from C(4,0) to F(2,2), which we've already determined. 

Now, returning to Point E. Let me assume that Line(D,E) connects D(4,4) to E, and Line(E,A) connects E to A(x,y). Also, since there's a Triangle(A,B,E), E is connected to A and B. So Line(E,A) and Line(E,B)? Or Line(E,A) and Line(E,B)? Wait, Triangle(A,B,E) implies three points A, B, E connected. So Line(A,B), Line(A,E), Line(B,E). 

Thus, E is connected to both A and B. So Line(E,A) and Line(E,B). But in the given predicates, there's Line(E,A) and Line(D,E). So E is connected to D and to A. So Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). 

To find E, we need to find the intersection of Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). But since E is connected to D and A, it's the intersection of Line(D,A) and Line(...) ? No, Line(D,E) and Line(E,A) imply that E is on both Line(D,E) and Line(E,A), which is trivial. Wait, no, Line(D,E) is from D to E, and Line(E,A) is from E to A. So E is a point such that it is on Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). But this just defines E as a point connected to D and A. 

Without more constraints, it's hard to determine E's exact location. However, maybe there's another relationship. Let me recall that there's a Line(A,G) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular, and other lines. 

Alternatively, perhaps E is the intersection of Line(D,E) and Line(B,E)? Or other lines? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since there's a Line(A,G) and Line(G,C), and Line(A,G) is vertical from A(x,y) to G(x,0), and Line(G,C) is from G(x,0) to C(4,0). 

Let me assume that E is somewhere on Line(D,E) and Line(E,A). Let me parameterize E. Let me assume that Line(D,E) is from D(4,4) to E, and Line(E,A) is from E to A(x,y). Let me assume that E is somewhere along Line(D,A). Wait, but that might not necessarily be true. 

Alternatively, since there's a Triangle(A,B,E), and we know coordinates for A and B, maybe E is determined by some property. 

But without additional info, this is tricky. Maybe I can proceed without needing E's exact coordinates, since the question is about angle 6, which might be in one of the existing triangles or lines. 

Let me recap what we have so far. We have coordinates for B, C, D, F, G. A and G are on a vertical line. Let me pick specific values for x and y to satisfy AB = 3. Let me choose x and y such that x² + y² = 9. Let me choose x = 3, y = 0. But then A would be (3,0), which is on Line(B,C), which is from (0,0) to (4,0). So A would be on BC, making Triangle(A,B,C) degenerate. Not good. 

Choose x = 0, y = 3. Then A is (0,3). Then Line(A,G) is vertical from (0,3) to G(0,0), which is point B. Again, overlapping. Not allowed. 

Choose x = 3, y = 0: same issue. How about x = 1, y = √(9 - 1) = √8 ≈ 2.828. So A is (1, 2√2). Then G is (1, 0). 

Now, with A at (1, 2√2), G at (1, 0). Now, Line(A,G) is vertical from (1, 2√2) to (1,0). Line(G,C) is from (1,0) to C(4,0). 

Now, what about other elements? 

Now, what about Line(A,G) and Line(B,C) being perpendicular? Yes, because Line(B,C) is horizontal, Line(A,G) is vertical. 

Now, what about other angles? Let me think about angle 6. Since the answer choices are small integers, maybe it's an angle in a triangle with sides 3,4,5. For example, in a 3-4-5 triangle, the angles are approx 37°, 53°, 90°. But none of the options match. Wait, but the given lengths are AB=3 and CD=4. Maybe there's a 3-4-5 triangle involved. 

Wait, in Triangle(A,G,C), which is right-angled at G. AG is from A(1, 2√2) to G(1,0): length is 2√2. GC is from G(1,0) to C(4,0): length is 3. So AG = 2√2, GC = 3. Hypotenuse AC is sqrt( (4-1)^2 + (0-2√2)^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 8) = sqrt(17). 

Then, angles in this triangle: tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = AG/GC = (2√2)/3. So theta = arctan(2√2/3). Let me calculate this value. 

Calculate 2√2 ≈ 2*1.414 ≈ 2.828. Divided by 3 ≈ 0.9428. Arctangent of 0.9428 is approximately 43.3 degrees. Not matching any of the options. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at A or C? Let me compute angle at A. In Triangle(A,G,C), angle at A: adjacent sides are AG and AC. Wait, no: in right-angled triangle at G, angle at A is opposite to GC. So sin(angle at A) = GC / AC = 3 / sqrt(17) ≈ 3/4.123 ≈ 0.728. Arcsin(0.728) ≈ 47 degrees. Still not matching options. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at C? In right-angled triangle at G, angle at C is opposite to AG: sin(angle at C) = AG / AC = (2√2)/sqrt(17) ≈ 2.828/4.123 ≈ 0.685. Arcsin(0.685) ≈ 43.3 degrees. Still not matching. 

Hmm. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the placement of points. Let me try choosing different coordinates for A. 

Let me choose x = 3, y = 0, but then A would be on Line(B,C), which makes Triangle(A,B,C) degenerate. Not allowed. 

What if I choose x = 0, y = 3? Then A is (0,3), G is (0,0), which is B. Not allowed. 

How about x = 2, y = sqrt(9 - 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. So A is (2, sqrt(5)), G is (2,0). Then AG is from (2,sqrt(5)) to (2,0), length sqrt(5). GC is from (2,0) to C(4,0), length 2. Hypotenuse AC is sqrt((4-2)^2 + (0-sqrt(5))^2) = sqrt(4 + 5) = 3. So AC = 3. 

Now, in right-angled Triangle(A,G,C), with legs AG = sqrt(5), GC = 2, hypotenuse AC = 3. Check Pythagoras: (sqrt(5))² + 2² = 5 + 4 = 9 = 3². Correct. 

Now, angles in this triangle: let's calculate angle at A. Opposite side is GC = 2, adjacent is AG = sqrt(5). So tan(theta) = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.894. Arctangent of 0.894 is approx 41.8 degrees. Still not matching the options. 

Angle at C: tan(theta) = AG / GC = sqrt(5)/2 ≈ 1.118. Arctangent ≈ 48.1 degrees. 

Still no match. 

Wait, but maybe angle 6 is not in this triangle. Maybe it's in another triangle. Let me think about the other right triangle: Triangle(C,F,D), which is right-angled at F. CF and FD are legs, CD is hypotenuse (length 4). 

CF is from C(4,0) to F(2,2): length sqrt((4-2)^2 + (
