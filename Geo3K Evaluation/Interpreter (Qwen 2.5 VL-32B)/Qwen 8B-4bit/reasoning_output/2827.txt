MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus ABCD. The given information includes several predicates. Let me start by recalling what a rhombus is. All sides are equal, opposite angles are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles.

First, the question asks for the measure of angle ADB. Wait, angle ADB... Let me visualize the rhombus. Points A, B, C, D. In a rhombus, the vertices are connected in order, so AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. The diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at point E, which is given as the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, there are some angle measures given. Specifically, angle DAB is 2 units? Wait, wait, the problem says m∠DAB = 2. Wait, but angles in a rhombus are typically measured in degrees, but here it's written as equals 2. Maybe that's in radians? But maybe the problem uses a different unit. However, since the answer choices are numerical without units, perhaps it's in degrees. Hmm, but 2 degrees seems very small for a rhombus angle. Wait, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "m ∠DAB = 2, m ∠ADC and CB = 6". Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the original problem says: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠D A B = 2, m ∠A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠A D B." Oh, perhaps there was a formatting issue. Maybe it's supposed to say that the measure of angle ADC is something, and CB has length 6? Because CB is a side of the rhombus. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, so if CB is 6, then all sides are 6. Then, angle DAB is given as 2. Wait, but angles in a rhombus are usually more than 0 degrees and less than 180. If angle DAB is 2 degrees, that would make the adjacent angle (angle ABC) equal to 180 - 2 = 178 degrees. That seems extremely narrow. But maybe the problem uses radians? 2 radians is about 114.6 degrees. Still, that doesn't align with typical problems. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem transcription. Wait, perhaps the angle DAB is 2 times something? Or maybe the measure is given in terms of another angle?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that angle DAB is 2x, and angle ADC is x? Wait, but the way it's written is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement again carefully.

Original problem: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠D A B = 2, m ∠A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠A D B."

Hmm, maybe there's a translation error or formatting issue. Perhaps it should be m∠DAB = 2°, and m∠ADC is something else, and CB = 6? Wait, but CB is a side, so if CB = 6, then all sides are 6. Then angle DAB is 2°, which seems too small. Alternatively, maybe angle DAB is 2 radians? But even then, 2 radians is roughly 114.59 degrees. Let me think.

But maybe the problem is in radians, and the answer options are in degrees? Wait, the answer choices are A. 30, B. 60, C. 90, D. 120. Those are all standard degree measures. So if angle DAB is 2 radians, converting to degrees would be approximately 114.59, which isn't one of the options. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here.

Wait, looking back at the given predicates. The user provided a list of predicates, including Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), 2). So the measure of angle DAB is 2. But in standard geometric problems, angles are often in degrees. However, 2 degrees is extremely small. But perhaps it's in radians? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the angle is 2 times π radians? But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the angle being 2 times some other measure. Wait, but given that there are also right angles mentioned in the predicates, like RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)), etc., which suggests that certain angles are 90 degrees. Also, the diagonals intersect at E, which is the midpoint. Given that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but in the predicates, they mention that the diagonals intersect at E, and that there are right angles at points AEB, BEC, etc. So that confirms that the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, given that, let's consider the properties of a rhombus. Diagonals bisect the angles. So, in a rhombus, each diagonal splits the angles into two equal parts. For example, diagonal AC bisects angles A and C, and diagonal BD bisects angles B and D. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular.

Now, the question is to find m∠ADB. Let's clarify what angle ADB is. Point D, point A, point B. So angle at point D between points A and B. Wait, but in a rhombus, the vertices are connected as A-B-C-D-A. So angle at D is angle ADC. Wait, but angle ADB would be the angle at point D formed by points A, D, B. Wait, but D is connected to A and C. So point B is not directly connected to D. Wait, in the rhombus, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So the diagonals are AC and BD. So BD connects B to D. Therefore, angle ADB is the angle at D between points A, D, B. So that would be part of triangle ABD. 

Let me draw this mentally. Rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at E. So E is the midpoint. Given that angle DAB is 2 (whatever unit), and CB is 6 (so all sides are 6). Need to find measure of angle ADB.

Since diagonals in a rhombus bisect the angles. So angle DAB is split by diagonal BD into two equal angles. So angle ADB is half of angle DAB? Wait, no. Wait, angle DAB is at vertex A. The diagonal BD goes from B to D. So BD splits angle at B and angle at D. Wait, no, the diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal AC bisects angles at A and C, while diagonal BD bisects angles at B and D.

Therefore, angle DAB is at vertex A, so the diagonal BD would not bisect that angle. Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals bisect the angles. So angle DAB is at vertex A, so the diagonal that bisects that angle would be the one that comes from the opposite vertex. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So the diagonal that starts at vertex A would go to the opposite vertex C, splitting angle A into two equal parts. Similarly, the diagonal BD starts at B and goes to D, splitting angle B and angle D into two equal parts.

So, angle DAB is at vertex A, so its bisector would be diagonal AC. Therefore, angle BAD is split by AC into two equal angles. Therefore, angle BAC and angle CAD are each half of angle BAD.

But the problem mentions that line BD bisects angle DAB. Wait, according to the given predicates, BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(D,A,B)). Wait, Angle(D,A,B) is angle at A between D and B, i.e., angle DAB. So line BD bisects angle DAB. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals do not bisect the angles unless specified. Wait, no—wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal BD connects B to D. At vertex A, the angle is DAB. How does BD relate to that angle? It seems that BD is not passing through vertex A. Wait, BD is connecting B to D. So BD is a diagonal. Therefore, the angle at A is between sides AD and AB. The diagonal BD passes through the intersection point E, which is the midpoint of the diagonals. So, perhaps the diagonal BD divides angle at A? No, because BD starts at B and ends at D. So, the diagonal BD would pass through the interior of the rhombus, but does it bisect angle at A? That would require that BD is the angle bisector of angle DAB. But in a rhombus, the angle bisectors are the diagonals. Wait, actually, yes. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, the diagonal from B to D would bisect angle at B and angle at D. The diagonal from A to C would bisect angles at A and C. Therefore, angle DAB is at vertex A, so the bisector of that angle is diagonal AC, not BD. So why does the predicate say that line BD bisects angle DAB?

This seems contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, the user provided the following predicates:

- BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(D,A,B)) – which means line BD bisects angle DAB.

Similarly, BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(C,B,A)) – meaning line BD bisects angle ABC.

But in a standard rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal BD should bisect angles at B and D. But according to this, line BD is bisecting angles at A and B. Which contradicts my previous understanding. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Wait, perhaps the labeling of the rhombus is different. Maybe the rhombus is labeled differently. Let me confirm the order of the vertices.

Assuming the rhombus is labeled in order A, B, C, D, so that AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. Then, the diagonals are AC and BD. In that case, diagonal BD connects B to D, which are opposite vertices. Therefore, BD should bisect angles at B and D, not at A. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. But according to the given predicates, line BD bisects angle DAB (at A) and angle ABC (at B). This suggests that the labeling might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a standard rhombus, but some other configuration. Wait, but the first predicate is Rhombus(A,B,C,D), so it's definitely a rhombus.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not at vertex A. Let me parse the angle D,A,B. In angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So angle DAB is at vertex A, between points D and B. So that's angle at A between DA and AB. Therefore, the bisector of that angle would be a line starting at A and going towards the opposite direction. But according to the predicate, line BD bisects that angle. Therefore, BD is passing through the angle at A? That would mean that BD is the bisector of angle DAB, implying that BD starts at B and ends at D, passing through the interior of the rhombus such that it splits angle at A. That seems impossible unless the rhombus is degenerate or the labeling is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mislabeling. Suppose the rhombus is labeled A, B, C, D in such a way that the diagonals are not AC and BD. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So if it's A-B-C-D, then diagonals are AC and BD. Therefore, BD connects B to D. So how could BD bisect angle at A?

This contradiction suggests that either there's an error in the problem setup or in the interpretation of the predicates. However, since this is a math problem, perhaps the given predicates are correct, and I need to work with them regardless of standard expectations.

Given that, let's proceed with the given predicates. So, according to the given, line BD bisects angle DAB (which is at vertex A). Therefore, BD is the angle bisector of angle DAB. Similarly, it also bisects angle ABC (at vertex B). Therefore, BD is acting as the angle bisector for both angles at A and B. This implies that BD is the angle bisector of angles at A and B, which in a rhombus would mean that BD is the same as the other diagonal AC? No, because AC is the other diagonal. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and each diagonal bisects two angles. So diagonal AC bisects angles at A and C, and diagonal BD bisects angles at B and D. Therefore, if BD is bisecting angle at A, that would imply that BD is the same as AC, which is not possible. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem's predicates, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle notation.

Alternatively, maybe the angle D,A,B refers to a different angle. Wait, angle DAB is at A, but maybe the predicate is written incorrectly. For instance, if the angle was meant to be angle ABD instead of DAB. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, I need to reconcile this.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not DAB but another angle. Let me check the predicate again: "BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(D,A,B))" — that is, line BD bisects angle DAB. Assuming that's correct, then BD is the bisector of angle DAB. So even though in standard rhombus properties, this shouldn't happen, but given that this is part of the problem's premises, I have to take it as given.

So proceeding under that assumption, even though it conflicts with standard rhombus properties, perhaps due to specific construction.

Now, moving forward. We know that in a rhombus, all sides are equal. Given that CB = 6, so all sides are 6. Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA = 6.

Also, angle DAB is given as 2 (presumably in some unit, maybe degrees, radians, or another measure). Let's assume it's in degrees for simplicity, even though 2 degrees seems extreme, but let's see.

We need to find m∠ADB. Let's analyze triangle ABD. Points A, B, D. Wait, but in the rhombus, points A, B, D form a triangle. But since the diagonals intersect at E, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. So AE and BE are halves of the diagonals.

But given that BD bisects angle DAB, which is at point A. So, in triangle ABD, BD is the angle bisector of angle at A. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector. Wait, in triangle ABD, BD is the bisector of angle A, so it divides the opposite side (BD?) Wait, no. Wait, angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But here, BD is the angle bisector of angle at A in triangle ABD. Wait, but BD is a side of the triangle ABD? No, BD is a diagonal of the rhombus. So in triangle ABD, the angle at A is being bisected by BD. But BD is connected to point D and B. So the angle bisector of angle at A (between AB and AD) is BD. So applying the angle bisector theorem to triangle ABD, where the angle bisector is BD, which meets side BD at D? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because BD is the side itself. Wait, this seems confused. Let me think again.

In triangle ABD, the angle at A is between AB and AD. The angle bisector of this angle would be a line starting at A and going somewhere inside the triangle. But in our case, the angle bisector is BD, which starts at B and ends at D. So this suggests that BD is the angle bisector of angle at A. That would mean that BD starts at B, goes to D, and somehow bisects the angle at A. That seems geometrically impossible unless the triangle is degenerate or the points are arranged differently.

This indicates that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem setup, but since this is a given, perhaps we need to accept it and proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the labeling. Maybe the rhombus is labeled differently. Let me try to imagine the rhombus with points labeled such that the diagonals are AC and BD, and BD bisects angle at A. That would require that BD is the angle bisector of angle at A, which would mean that BD is the same as the other diagonal AC, which is not possible. So this seems contradictory.

Perhaps the problem involves a kite instead of a rhombus? No, because a rhombus is a type of kite with all sides equal. But the given predicates include Rhombus(A,B,C,D), so it's definitely a rhombus.

Alternatively, maybe the angle measure is not in degrees. If angle DAB is 2 radians, then converting to degrees would be 2*(180/pi) ≈ 114.59 degrees. Let's consider that possibility. If angle DAB is approximately 114.59 degrees, then the adjacent angle (angle ABC) would be 180 - 114.59 = 65.41 degrees. But then, since diagonals bisect angles, the diagonals would divide these angles into halves. But again, if BD bisects angle DAB, then angle BAD is split into two equal parts by BD. So each part would be approximately 57.295 degrees.

But how does this help us find angle ADB? Let's focus on triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, we have sides AB = 6, AD = 6, and BD is a diagonal. The angle at A is angle BAD = 2 radians (approx 114.59 degrees). The angle at A is being bisected by BD, so the angle between BA and BD is half of angle BAD. Let me denote that as α = angle ABD. Wait, no. If BD is the bisector of angle BAD, then it splits angle BAD into two equal parts. So each part is (BAD)/2. So in triangle ABD, angle at A is split into two angles of (BAD)/2. But BD is the bisector, so in triangle ABD, the angle at A is split into two angles, each equal to (BAD)/2. Then, using the law of sines or cosines in triangle ABD, we can find other angles.

But in triangle ABD, we have sides AB = 6, AD = 6, and BD. Let's denote BD as d. Then, using the law of cosines in triangle ABD:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(angle BAD)

Which gives:

d² = 6² + 6² - 2*6*6*cos(2 radians)

Calculating this would give the length of BD. Once we have BD, we can use the law of sines to find angle ADB.

But angle ADB is the angle at D in triangle ABD. Let me denote angle ADB as θ. In triangle ABD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So:

angle at A (split into two angles of (BAD)/2) + angle at B + angle at D = 180 degrees.

Wait, but angle at B in triangle ABD is not necessarily the same as angle ABC in the rhombus. Wait, in the rhombus, angle ABC is adjacent to angle DAB. But in triangle ABD, angle at B is part of that.

However, since BD is the angle bisector of angle BAD, and in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Wait, but earlier contradictions suggest confusion. Let me try to proceed with the calculation.

Assume angle BAD = 2 radians (approximately 114.59 degrees). Then, each of the two angles created by the bisector BD is 1 radian (approximately 57.295 degrees).

In triangle ABD, angles at A is 2 radians, angle at B is ?, angle at D is θ.

Using the law of sines:

AB / sin(θ) = BD / sin(angle at A) = AD / sin(angle at B)

But AB = AD = 6, so:

6 / sin(θ) = BD / sin(2) => BD = 6*sin(2)/sin(theta)

Also, 6 / sin(theta) = 6 / sin(angle at B) => sin(theta) = sin(angle at B)

Therefore, theta = angle at B or supplementary. Since the angles are in a triangle, they must be acute or obtuse depending on the triangle.

But angle at B in triangle ABD is angle ABD. Which is part of the larger angle ABC in the rhombus. But since BD bisects angle ABC as well (from the given predicates: BisectsAngle(Line(B,D), Angle(C,B,A))), which is angle ABC. So angle ABC is split by BD into two equal parts. Therefore, angle ABD = angle CBD = (angle ABC)/2.

But in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle ABC = 180 - angle BAD. If angle BAD is 2 radians, then angle ABC = pi - 2 radians (if in radians). Converting to degrees, angle ABC would be 180 - (2 * (180/pi)) degrees ≈ 180 - 114.59 = 65.41 degrees. Therefore, each of the angles ABD and CBD is half of that, which is approximately 32.7 degrees.

So in triangle ABD, angle at B is 32.7 degrees, angle at A is 114.59 degrees, so angle at D (theta) is 180 - 114.59 - 32.7 ≈ 32.7 degrees. Wait, that would make triangle ABD have angles of approx 114.59, 32.7, 32.7. So angle ADB is 32.7 degrees. But none of the answer choices are close to that. The options are 30, 60, 90, 120. So this suggests that my assumption about the angle being in radians is incorrect.

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ABC is 178 degrees, so each of the angles ABD and CBD would be 89 degrees. Then, in triangle ABD, angle at A is 2 degrees, angle at B is 89 degrees, so angle at D is 180 - 2 - 89 = 89 degrees. So angle ADB would be 89 degrees, which is close to 90 degrees, but not exactly. The closest answer is C. 90. But this is speculative.

But the problem may have intended that angle DAB is 2 radians, leading to angle ADB being approximately 57.29 degrees, which is not among the options. Alternatively, there's a different approach.

Wait, but considering the given that there are right angles at points AEB, BEC, etc. So the diagonals are perpendicular. So in the rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle AED is a right triangle, with right angle at E. So AE ⊥ BE.

Also, given that E is the midpoint of both diagonals. So AE = EC, BE = ED.

Moreover, the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles. Each of those triangles has legs equal to half the lengths of the diagonals.

Let me denote the diagonals as follows: AC = p, BD = q. Then, AE = p/2, BE = q/2. And since diagonals are perpendicular, the area of the rhombus is (p*q)/2.

Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: (p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 = side^2. Since each side is 6, so:

(p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 = 6^2 → p² + q² = 4*36 = 144.

Additionally, the angles of the rhombus can be related to the diagonals. For example, the diagonals split the angles into two equal parts. So, if one of the angles is θ, then tan(θ/2) = (q/2)/(p/2) = q/p. Or vice versa, depending on which angle we're considering.

But given that angle DAB is 2, and angle ADC is something. Wait, but angle ADC is the angle at D, which is supplementary to angle DAB. So angle ADC = 180 - angle DAB. If angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ADC is 178 degrees. But that seems too large. However, if angle DAB is 2 radians, then angle ADC is pi - 2 radians ≈ 1.14 radians ≈ 65.4 degrees.

But how does this help us find angle ADB?

Angle ADB is the angle at D between points A, D, B. Let's consider triangle ABD. In this triangle, we have points A, B, D. The angle at D is what we need to find. To find this angle, we can use the law of cosines or sines if we know the lengths of the sides or other angles.

But we know the length of AB is 6. What about the lengths of AD and BD?

AD is a side of the rhombus, so AD = 6. BD is a diagonal. If we can find BD, then we can apply the law of cosines in triangle ABD.

To find BD, we can use the relationship between the diagonals and the angles of the rhombus. For a rhombus, the lengths of the diagonals can be expressed in terms of the side length and the angles.

Specifically, if θ is one of the angles of the rhombus (say, angle DAB), then the lengths of the diagonals are:

p = 2 * side * cos(theta/2)

q = 2 * side * sin(theta/2)

Wait, let me recall. In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy:

p = 2 * side * cos(theta/2)

q = 2 * side * sin(theta/2)

Where theta is one of the angles. Let me verify this. 

Yes, because the diagonals split the angles into two equal parts. So, for angle theta at A, the diagonal AC splits it into two angles of theta/2. Then, in triangle ABD, which is half of the rhombus, the diagonal AC is split into two equal parts. Wait, perhaps I need to derive it.

Consider a rhombus with side length 'a' and angle theta at A. The diagonals p and q can be found using the law of cosines on the triangles formed by the diagonals.

For example, in triangle ABD, where AB = AD = a, and angle at A is theta. The diagonal BD can be found using the law of cosines:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(theta)

= a² + a² - 2*a²*cos(theta)

= 2a²(1 - cos(theta))

Thus, BD = sqrt(2a²(1 - cos(theta))) = a*sqrt(2(1 - cos(theta)))

Similarly, the other diagonal AC can be found by considering the other angle, which is 180 - theta. Using the same formula:

AC² = 2a²(1 - cos(180 - theta)) = 2a²(1 + cos(theta))

Because cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta)

So AC = a*sqrt(2(1 + cos(theta)))

Therefore, the lengths of the diagonals are related to the angles.

But in our case, we know that angle DAB is 2 (let's assume it's in radians for now), and the side length a = 6.

So BD = 6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))

And AC = 6*sqrt(2(1 + cos(2)))

But we also know that the diagonals are perpendicular, and they bisect each other. Also, the diagonals intersect at E, which is the midpoint. So, in triangle AED, which is a right triangle, with AE = AC/2 = 3*sqrt(1 + cos(2)), and BE = BD/2 = 3*sqrt(1 - cos(2)).

But how does this help us find angle ADB?

Angle ADB is the angle at D in triangle ABD. Let me consider triangle ABD. In this triangle, we have sides:

AB = 6

AD = 6

BD = 6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))

We can use the law of cosines to find angle ADB.

Law of cosines: 

cos(angle ADB) = (AD² + BD² - AB²) / (2*AD*BD)

Plugging in:

AD = 6, AB = 6, BD = 6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))

So,

cos(angle ADB) = (6² + [6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))]² - 6²) / (2*6*[6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))])

Simplify numerator:

6² cancels out, leaving [ (6² * 2(1 - cos(2)) ) ] 

Denominator: 2*6*6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2))) = 72*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))

So numerator is 36*2(1 - cos(2)) = 72(1 - cos(2))

Thus,

cos(angle ADB) = 72(1 - cos(2)) / [72*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)))] = [ (1 - cos(2)) / sqrt(2(1 - cos(2)) ) ] = sqrt(1 - cos(2))/sqrt(2)

Simplify further: sqrt[(1 - cos(2))/2] = sin(1), since 1 - cos(2) = 2sin²(1), so sqrt(2sin²(1))/sqrt(2) = sin(1). Wait, let me verify:

Using the identity: 1 - cos(x) = 2sin²(x/2). So, substituting x = 2:

1 - cos(2) = 2sin²(1)

Therefore, sqrt[(1 - cos(2))/2] = sqrt[sin²(1)] = |sin(1)| = sin(1) since 1 radian is in the first quadrant.

Thus, cos(angle ADB) = sin(1)

So angle ADB = arccos(sin(1))

But sin(1) = cos(pi/2 - 1), so arccos(cos(pi/2 - 1)) = pi/2 - 1 radians.

Converting to degrees, pi/2 is 90 degrees, and 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. So angle ADB ≈ 90 - 57.3 = 32.7 degrees.

But this is approximately 32.7 degrees, which is close to 30 degrees (option A) or 30. But the options don't have 32.7. However, if angle DAB is in degrees, then let's recalculate with angle DAB = 2 degrees.

If angle DAB = 2 degrees, then applying the same derivation:

1 - cos(2 degrees) = 2sin²(1 degree)

Then, angle ADB = arccos(sin(1 degree)) = arccos(cos(89 degrees)) = 89 degrees, since sin(1 degree) = cos(89 degrees). Thus, angle ADB = 89 degrees, which is close to 90 degrees (option C). 

But the answer options are A. 30, B. 60, C. 90, D. 120. So 89 degrees is closest to option C (90 degrees). But this depends on whether angle DAB is in degrees or radians.

However, the problem states "m∠DAB = 2", and the answer options are likely in degrees. If angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ADB is approximately 89 degrees, which rounds to 90 degrees. Hence, the answer would be C. 90 degrees.

But why would angle DAB be 2 degrees? That seems very small, but if it's a trick question or if the problem uses a non-standard unit, this could be plausible.

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 2 radians, then angle ADB is approximately 32.7 degrees, which doesn't match any option. But since the answer choices don't include 32.7, this suggests that the angle is in degrees, making angle ADB ≈ 89 degrees, hence choosing option C.

Another approach: since the diagonals are perpendicular, and E is the midpoint, then in triangle AED, which is a right triangle, with AE and DE as legs. Also, since diagonals bisect each other, AE = AC/2, DE = BD/2.

But we know that CB = 6, so all sides are 6. Let's calculate the lengths of the diagonals.

From earlier, if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then:

BD = 6*sqrt(2(1 - cos(2°)))

Let's compute this numerically.

First, cos(2°) ≈ 0.99939

So 1 - cos(2°) ≈ 0.00061

Then, 2*(1 - cos(2°)) ≈ 0.00122

Square root of that is sqrt(0.00122) ≈ 0.0349

Multiply by 6: BD ≈ 6 * 0.0349 ≈ 0.2094

So BD is approximately 0.2094, which is very short. Then, in triangle ABD, with sides AB=6, AD=6, BD≈0.2094. Using the law of cosines to find angle at D:

cos(angle ADB) = (AD² + BD² - AB²)/(2*AD*BD) = (36 + 0.00044 - 36)/(2*6*0.2094) = 0.00044/(2.5128) ≈ 0.000175

So angle ADB ≈ arccos(0.000175) ≈ 89.9 degrees, which is nearly 90 degrees. Hence, answer C.

This strongly suggests that the angle is in degrees, and the answer is 90 degrees. Hence, option C.

But why is angle ADB approaching 90 degrees? Because if the diagonal BD is very short, then triangle ABD is almost degenerate, with angle at D approaching 90 degrees. This happens when angle DAB is very small, causing BD to be very short.

Thus, despite the apparent absurdity of angle DAB being 2 degrees, the calculation leads to angle ADB being approximately 90 degrees, matching option C.
