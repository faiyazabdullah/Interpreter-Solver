MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

Starting with the points: Y, A, B, X, Z. Then there are several lines mentioned—Line(Y,A), Line(A,B), Line(Y,B), Line(A,X), Line(X,B). Also, angles at points A and X involving these lines. There's mention of right angles at Angle(Y,A,X) and Angle(A,X,B), so those are right angles. 

Looking at the lengths: LengthOf(Line(Y,A)) is 5, LengthOf(Line(Y,B)) is 14. The question asks for z, which is the length of Line(A,B), since Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), z). So we need to find z.

Now, the key here seems to involve right triangles. The predicates mention that Angle(Y,A,X) and Angle(A,X,B) are right angles. Let me visualize this. Point Y connected to A and B, forming triangle YAB. But also, there's a point X connected to A and B such that AX and XB form another structure. Wait, the lines are Line(A,X) and Line(X,B), which suggests that X is connected to A and B, making a segment AB split by X? Or maybe X is a point where two perpendicular lines meet?

Wait, there's also Perpendicular(Line(Y,A), Line(A,B)). Since Line(Y,A) is one leg of the right angle at A (from Angle(Y,A,X)), and Line(A,B) is another leg? No, wait. The right angle is at A for Angle(Y,A,X), which would mean that lines YA and AX are perpendicular. Similarly, Angle(A,X,B) being a right angle implies that AX and XB are perpendicular. Therefore, AX is perpendicular to both YA and XB. That suggests that AX is a common perpendicular line between YA and XB. 

But also, Line(Y,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,B). Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(Y,A), Line(A,B)). So line YA is perpendicular to line AB. And since Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, that means YA is perpendicular to AX. Wait, but if YA is perpendicular to AB, then AX must be along AB? Hmm, maybe I need to draw a diagram mentally.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure. Points Y, A, B, X. Line Y-A, Line A-B, Line Y-B. So triangle YAB is formed. Also, Line A-X and Line X-B. So X is connected to A and B. Additionally, Angles at A and X: Angle(Y,A,X) is right, and Angle(A,X,B) is right. So at point A, between Y and X, there's a right angle. At point X, between A and B, there's a right angle. 

So, starting with point A. From A, there's a line to Y (YA), and a line to X (AX). These two lines form a right angle at A. Also, Line A-B goes from A to B. The predicate says that Line(Y,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,B). So YA ⊥ AB. But earlier, we have that Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, implying that YA ⊥ AX. So if YA is perpendicular to both AB and AX, then AB and AX must be colinear? Because if a line is perpendicular to two different lines at the same point, those two lines must be in the same direction. Wait, unless they are in opposite directions. Wait, maybe AX is part of AB? Let me think again.

Wait, if YA is perpendicular to AB, and YA is also perpendicular to AX, then AX must lie along AB. Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line (YA), they must be parallel to each other. But since they both start at point A, they must be the same line. So that would imply that AX is along AB. However, there's also a line from X to B. So if X is on AB, then Line X-B is just a part of AB. But then the right angle at X between A and B (Angle(A,X,B)) would require that AX is perpendicular to XB. But if X is on AB, then AX and XB are parts of AB, so they can't be perpendicular unless AB is zero length, which isn't possible. Contradiction. So my initial assumption must be wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine. The Perpendicular(Line(Y,A), Line(A,B)) means that YA is perpendicular to AB. The Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, so YA is perpendicular to AX. Therefore, AX is perpendicular to YA, and AB is also perpendicular to YA. Therefore, AX and AB must be parallel? Because both are perpendicular to YA. Wait, yes! If two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So AX || AB. But since both AX and AB start at point A, this would mean that AX and AB are the same line. But then, if X is on AB, then the line from X to B is just part of AB. But then the Angle(A,X,B) is supposed to be a right angle. Which would require that AX is perpendicular to XB. But if X is on AB, then AX and XB are collinear, so they can't be perpendicular. Hence, contradiction again. 

This suggests that my understanding of the configuration is incorrect. Let me check the predicates again. Oh, there's also Line(X,B) and Line(A,X). So X is connected to both A and B, forming segments AX and XB. Also, Angle(A,X,B) is a right angle. So at point X, the angle between AX and XB is 90 degrees. So AX ⊥ XB. Additionally, Line(Y,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,B). So YA ⊥ AB. Also, Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, meaning YA ⊥ AX. So combining these, YA is perpendicular to both AX and AB. Thus, AX and AB are both perpendicular to YA, hence they are parallel. So AX || AB. But since both AX and AB start at A, they must be the same line. But that leads us back to the previous contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps X is not on AB? But if AX is parallel to AB, and X is connected to B, then perhaps X is somewhere off the line AB. Let me try to imagine this. Suppose YA is vertical, AB is horizontal (since YA ⊥ AB). Then AX is also vertical because it's perpendicular to YA. So AX is vertical, going up from A. Then X is some point vertically above A. Then XB connects X to B, which is horizontally to the right (assuming AB is horizontal). For the angle at X between A and B (Angle(A,X,B)) to be a right angle, the lines XA and XB must be perpendicular. But XA is vertical (upward), and XB goes from X to B. So if XA is vertical and XB needs to be horizontal to make a right angle. But B is horizontally aligned with A (since AB is horizontal). So if X is directly above A, then XB would go from X to B, which is to the right. So the angle at X between A and B would be between XA (vertical) and XB (diagonal). Unless B is positioned such that XB is horizontal. Wait, but if B is horizontally aligned with A, then XB would be diagonal from X (above A) to B (right of A). So the angle at X between XA (vertical) and XB (diagonal) would not be a right angle. Therefore, something's wrong here. 

Alternatively, maybe AB is not horizontal. Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to points to model this. Let’s assume coordinate system with point A at origin (0,0). Since Line(Y,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), and Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle. Let me suppose that YA is along the y-axis, so Y is at (0, y) for some y. Then AB is horizontal, so B is at (b, 0). Now, Line(Y,A) is from Y(0,y) to A(0,0), which is vertical. Then Line(A,B) is horizontal from A(0,0) to B(b,0). Now, Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, so at point A, between Y and X. Since YA is vertical, then AX must be horizontal to make the right angle. So AX is horizontal, so X has coordinates (x, 0). But then Line(X,B) goes from X(x,0) to B(b,0). So if x < b, then XB is a horizontal line segment. But then Angle(A,X,B) is the angle at X between A and B. But X is at (x,0), A is at (0,0), B is at (b,0). So the lines XA is from X(x,0) to A(0,0) (leftward horizontal), and XB is from X(x,0) to B(b,0) (rightward horizontal). So the angle at X between A and B is 180 degrees, not a right angle. This contradicts the given that Angle(A,X,B) is a right angle. 

Therefore, this setup doesn't work. What's wrong here? Maybe my assumption about the position of X is incorrect. Perhaps AX is not horizontal? Let me reconsider. 

Since YA is vertical (as per earlier), and Angle(Y,A,X) is a right angle, so AX must be horizontal. Wait, but if AX is horizontal, then X lies along the horizontal line through A. But then Line(X,B) would connect X to B. For Angle(A,X,B) to be a right angle, the lines XA and XB must be perpendicular. But XA is horizontal, so XB must be vertical. But B is at (b,0), so if X is at (x,0), then XB goes from (x,0) to (b,0), which is horizontal. To make XB vertical, B would have to be at (x, c), but earlier we said B is at (b,0). So inconsistency. 

Hmm. This suggests that there's an error in my assumptions. Let me check the predicates again. There's also the statement that Perpendicular(Line(A,X), Line(X,B)). So Line(A,X) is perpendicular to Line(X,B). So at point X, the lines AX and XB are perpendicular. Therefore, AX ⊥ XB. So in the coordinate system, if AX is horizontal, then XB must be vertical. So if X is at (x,0), then B would have to be at (x, k) for some k. But earlier, B was at (b,0). So this is conflicting. 

Wait, but the line AB is from A(0,0) to B(b,0). So B is at (b,0). But if XB is vertical from X(x,0), then B must be at (x, k). Therefore, unless x = b, which would put B at (b,k), but then B would not be on the original line AB unless k=0. So this seems impossible. 

This indicates that there's a miscalculation. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the triangle YAB is a right triangle. Given that Line(Y,A) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), so triangle YAB is right-angled at A. Therefore, by Pythagoras, (YB)^2 = (YA)^2 + (AB)^2. We know YA is 5, YB is 14, so plugging in: 14² = 5² + AB² → AB² = 14² -5² = 196 -25 = 171 → AB = √171 = 3√19. Wait, but the question asks for z, which is the length of AB. So z equals √171, which simplifies to 3√19. Looking at the options, option C is 3√19. 

Wait, but why did the rest of the predicates matter? The problem includes more information, like the angles at X and the perpendicularity of AX and XB. But according to this calculation, z is determined solely by the right triangle YAB. However, the presence of X and other conditions may be red herrings or confirm the configuration. Let me verify if this holds. 

Given that Triangle(Y,A,B) is right-angled at A, so the hypotenuse is YB. The predicate IsHypotenuseOf(Line(Y,B), Triangle(Y,A,B)) confirms that. So using Pythagoras, YB² = YA² + AB². So with YB=14, YA=5, then AB² = 14² -5² = 196 -25 = 171. So AB = sqrt(171) = sqrt(9*19) = 3*sqrt(19). Hence, z is 3√19, which is option C. 

But why were the other predicates included? Like the ones about X and the right angles at X? Maybe they're meant to confirm that the configuration is consistent. For example, the fact that AX is perpendicular to XB and YA is perpendicular to AB could be part of the construction leading to the right triangle YAB. But regardless, the calculation via Pythagoras gives us z directly. 

Therefore, the answer should be option C.
