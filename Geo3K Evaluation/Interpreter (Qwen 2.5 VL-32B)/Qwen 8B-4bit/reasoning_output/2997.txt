Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points F, G, H, J. There's a circle with center H, since PointLiesOnCircle(F, Circle(H)) and others. Wait, actually, the Circle(H) means that H is the center? Because usually, a circle is defined by its center and radius. So if there's a point H, and other points lie on the circle centered at H, then H is the center. 

So, points F, G, J are on the circle with center H. That means HF, HG, HJ are radii of the circle. Also, Line(F,G) is a chord of the circle because it connects two points on the circle. Then, Line(F,H) is a radius, so that's one radius. Similarly, maybe Line(H,J) is another radius?

Wait, the predicates say IsRadiusOf(Line(F,H), Circle(H)). So Line(F,H) is a radius. Since H is the center, then F is a point on the circle, so HF is a radius. Therefore, FH is a radius. Similarly, since G is on the circle, HG is also a radius. And J is on the circle, so HJ is a radius. So all those lines from H to the points are radii.

Now, looking at the lines: Line(F,G) is a chord, Line(F,J) and Line(H,J). Let me visualize this. Points F, G, J are on the circle with center H. So, connecting F to G gives a chord. Connecting F to J and H to J. So maybe triangle FHJ? Or triangle FGH?

But the key thing here is the angles. The question mentions the measure of Angle(F,H,J) equals twice the measure of Angle(F,G,H). Wait, the predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F,H,J)), 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H))). So, they're saying that angle at H, between F and J, is twice the angle at H between F and G. But wait, angle FGH? Wait, Angle(F,G,H) would be the angle at point G between points F, G, H. Hmm, but how does that relate to the rest?

Wait, maybe I need to use the Central Angle Theorem. The given predicate uses UseTheorem(CentralAngleTheorem). The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So, if there's an inscribed angle and a central angle that intercept the same arc, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.

Let me think. Let's look at Angle(F,G,H). This is the angle at point G, formed by points F, G, H. Wait, but point G is on the circle. So, FG is a chord, and GH is a radius. Wait, but the angle at G would involve points F, G, H. However, since H is the center, GH is a radius, and FG is a chord. So triangle FGH has vertices at F, G, H. In this triangle, GH is a radius, FG is a chord, and FH is another radius. Wait, but FH is a radius, so triangle FGH is an isosceles triangle with sides FH = GH (both radii). Therefore, angles opposite these sides should be equal. Wait, but angle at G is Angle(F,G,H). Let me clarify the triangle.

In triangle FGH, the sides are FG (chord), GH (radius), and FH (radius). So FH and GH are equal, making triangle FGH isosceles with base FG and equal sides FH and GH. Therefore, the base angles at F and G are equal. Wait, but angle at G is part of the triangle. Wait, angle at G is angle FGH. Wait, but in triangle FGH, the two equal sides are FH and GH. Therefore, angles opposite them would be angles at G and F. Wait, side FH is opposite angle G, and side GH is opposite angle F. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle FGH:

- Side opposite angle F is GH.
- Side opposite angle G is FH.
- Side opposite angle H is FG.

Since FH and GH are both radii, they are equal. Therefore, angles opposite them, which are angles at G and F respectively, are equal. Therefore, angle at G (angle FGH) equals angle at F (angle GFH).

But how does this relate to the given angle measures?

The problem states that angle F,H,J (which is angle at H between F and J) is twice angle F,G,H (which is angle at G between F and H). Wait, angle F,G,H is angle at G, so angle FGH. So according to the problem, angle at H (F,H,J) is twice angle at G (F,G,H). How do these angles relate?

Maybe considering arcs. The Central Angle Theorem relates central angles to inscribed angles. For example, if there's an inscribed angle subtending an arc, then the central angle over the same arc is twice the inscribed angle.

But angle FGH is an angle at point G, which is on the circumference. Let's see. The angle at G (FGH) is an inscribed angle? Wait, if we consider the arc from F to H. Wait, but H is the center. So the arc from F to H would be... Well, since H is the center, the arc from F to H isn't directly applicable unless we consider the arc that corresponds to the angle at G.

Alternatively, perhaps angle FGH is an inscribed angle subtending some arc. Let me think. The angle at G, between points F, G, H. Since H is the center, GH is a radius. So, GH is going from G to the center. So, maybe the angle at G involves the arc from F to H? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since angle FGH is at G, and H is the center. So, the segment GH is a radius, and FG is a chord. So, maybe angle FGH is related to the arc FH. Let's recall that an inscribed angle subtended by arc FH would be half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. But angle FGH is at point G, so if we consider the arc from F to H that doesn't pass through G. Wait, but H is the center. So, the arc from F to H would be a semicircle? No, because H is the center, so the arc from F to H isn't really an arc along the circumference; H is the center, not a point on the circle. Wait, confusion arises here.

Wait, points F, G, J are on the circle. H is the center. So, the line segments from H to each of these points are radii. So, angle F,H,J is at point H, between points F and J. So, that's a central angle because H is the center. Therefore, angle F,H,J is a central angle subtended by arc FJ. Therefore, the measure of angle F,H,J is equal to the measure of arc FJ.

Meanwhile, angle F,G,H is angle at point G, between F, G, H. So, this is an angle formed by points F-G-H, where G is on the circle, and H is the center. So, this is an angle between chord FG and radius GH. To find the measure of this angle, maybe we can consider triangle FGH again.

Earlier, we said that triangle FGH has FH = GH (since they are both radii), making it isosceles. So, angles at F and G are equal. Let me denote angle at G as θ. So angle FGH = θ. Then angle at F is also θ. The third angle at H would be 180° - 2θ.

But angle at H in triangle FGH is angle FGH? Wait, no. In triangle FGH, the three angles are at F, G, H. So angle at H is angle FGH? Wait, no. Wait, angle at H would be angle F H G? Wait, the angle at H is between points F, H, G. So, angle F H G. Which is the angle between FH and GH. Since FH and GH are both radii, this angle is the central angle for arc FG. Wait, so angle at H between F and G is the central angle for arc FG. Therefore, measure of angle F H G equals measure of arc FG.

But earlier, we had angle FGH (at G) being θ. So, in triangle FGH, angles sum to 180°, so:

θ + θ + angle at H = 180°

Therefore, 2θ + angle at H = 180°

But angle at H is the central angle for arc FG, which is equal to the measure of arc FG. Also, the inscribed angle subtended by arc FG would be half of that. But angle FGH is an inscribed angle? Wait, angle at G is between FG and GH. So, maybe it's not directly an inscribed angle. Maybe we need to consider another approach.

But according to the problem, angle F,H,J (the central angle for arc FJ) is equal to twice angle F,G,H (which is angle at G, which we called θ). So, angle F,H,J = 2θ. From our previous equation, angle at H in triangle FGH is angle F H G = 180° - 2θ. But angle F H G is the central angle for arc FG, so that measure is equal to arc FG. Therefore, arc FG = 180° - 2θ.

But how does this connect with angle F,H,J? Let's think about angle F,H,J. It's the central angle for arc FJ. Let's call that measure α. According to the problem, α = 2θ. 

Now, what's the relationship between arcs FG and FJ? Are there any relations between them? Maybe through point J. Since J is another point on the circle. So, if we can relate arc FJ to other arcs, perhaps through the circle's total circumference.

But without more information, maybe we need to consider other parts. Alternatively, maybe there's something about triangle FHJ. Since H is the center, and J is a point on the circle, so HJ is a radius. Therefore, triangle FHJ is an isosceles triangle with FH = HJ (both radii). Therefore, angles at F and J are equal. Wait, but angle at H is angle F,H,J which is α. So, angles at F and J would be (180° - α)/2 each.

But how does this help us? Maybe we need to relate angle θ (from before) to α. Recall that angle F,H,J = α = 2θ. Also, angle FGH = θ. But how to find θ?

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. Suppose we can express arc FG and arc FJ in terms of θ and α. But we need more connections.

Wait, maybe considering that point J is connected to F via line FJ. So, arc FJ is α, and arc FG is 180° - 2θ. But without knowing where J is located relative to FG, it's hard to tell. Unless there's another relation.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's go back. We know angle F,H,J = 2 * angle F,G,H. Let's call angle F,G,H as θ, so angle F,H,J = 2θ.

From triangle FGH, as discussed, angle at H (angle F H G) is equal to arc FG. Which is equal to 180° - 2θ (from earlier equation). Therefore, arc FG = 180° - 2θ.

Also, angle F,H,J (central angle for arc FJ) is 2θ. Therefore, arc FJ = 2θ.

Now, considering the entire circle, the sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. Let's suppose that the arc from F to G is arc FG = 180° - 2θ, arc from F to J is arc FJ = 2θ. What about arc from G to J? Depending on the position of J, but maybe we can find relations.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that points F, G, J are arranged such that moving from F to G to J around the circle. But without a diagram, it's challenging. However, maybe there's another relation involving triangle FHJ or other elements.

Wait, since J is on the circle, and H is the center, then HJ is a radius. Also, line FJ is a chord. So, angle at J, in triangle FHJ, is part of the isosceles triangle. As mentioned earlier, angles at F and J are equal. Let's denote those angles as β. So, β = (180° - α)/2, where α is angle F,H,J = 2θ. So, β = (180° - 2θ)/2 = 90° - θ.

But how does this connect with angle θ?

Alternatively, maybe considering that angle FGH (which is θ) is related to angle at J. Wait, perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? Or maybe other triangles?

Another thought: since angle FGH is θ, and angle at G is θ, and angle F,H,J is 2θ. If we could find another relationship between θ and other angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle FGH, angle at G is θ, and in triangle FHJ, angles at F and J are β = 90° - θ. But how?

Alternatively, let's think about the full circle. Suppose that arc FG is 180° - 2θ, arc FJ is 2θ. Then, depending on the position of J, the arc from G to J would be arc FG + arc FJ minus something, but this depends on direction.

Wait, maybe assuming that points F, G, J are placed such that moving from F to G to J around the circle, then arc FG + arc GJ = arc FJ. But arc FJ is 2θ, and arc FG is 180° - 2θ. So arc GJ would be arc FJ - arc FG = 2θ - (180° - 2θ) = 4θ - 180°. But this seems arbitrary without knowing the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the entire circle is 360°, so arc FG + arc FJ + ... but without knowing other arcs, this might not help.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider that angle F,H,J is a central angle for arc FJ, which is 2θ. And angle F,G,H is an angle inside the circle, which is θ. Perhaps θ is an inscribed angle for some arc?

Wait, angle F,G,H is at point G, which is on the circumference. So, it's an angle formed by points F, G, H. Since H is the center, GH is a radius. So, the angle between FG and GH. If we can consider this as an inscribed angle, but since one of the sides is a radius, maybe not.

Alternatively, consider extending GH to meet the circle at another point, but that may complicate things.

Wait, here's an idea. Let me draw triangle FGH. Since FH and GH are radii, triangle FGH is isosceles with FH=GH. The angle at G is θ, and the angle at H is 180° - 2θ. But angle at H is the central angle for arc FG, so that angle equals arc FG. Therefore, arc FG = 180° - 2θ.

Now, angle F,H,J is the central angle for arc FJ, which is 2θ. So, arc FJ = 2θ.

Now, suppose that points F, G, J are positioned such that arc FG and arc FJ are adjacent. Then, arc FJ = arc FG + arc GJ. Wait, but that depends on whether J is on the same side of FG as the arc. Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. But perhaps there's a relation between arc FG and arc FJ through another property.

Alternatively, since J is another point on the circle, maybe there's symmetry or another triangle involved. For instance, triangle FJH is isosceles with FH=HJ. So, angles at F and J are equal. Let's call those angles φ. Then, angle at H is 2θ, so 2φ + 2θ = 180° → φ = (180° - 2θ)/2 = 90° - θ.

Now, if we can relate φ to angle θ somehow. For example, if there's a triangle involving angle φ and angle θ.

Alternatively, consider triangle FGH and triangle FJH. Both are isosceles triangles. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe looking at the entire circle. The sum of all arcs is 360°. If arc FG is 180° - 2θ, and arc FJ is 2θ, then if we assume that arc FG and arc FJ are parts of the circle, but unless we know how they overlap, it's hard to proceed. Maybe there's a different way.

Wait, the problem states that angle F,H,J is twice angle F,G,H. So, angle at H (central angle) is twice angle at G (some angle). If we can express angle at G (θ) in terms of arcs, maybe.

Since angle at G (θ) is angle FGH. Let's think of this as an angle formed by chord FG and radius GH. Maybe this is related to an inscribed angle. For instance, if we consider the arc that is opposite to this angle. Wait, the angle between FG and GH. Since GH is a radius, and FG is a chord. The angle between a chord and a radius at the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Wait, that's the Alternate Segment Theorem. 

Yes! The Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between a tangent and a chord at the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. But in this case, we don't have a tangent, just a radius. Wait, but maybe we can derive something similar.

Alternatively, consider that angle FGH is between chord FG and radius GH. Let me imagine the tangent at point G. The angle between FG and the tangent would be equal to the angle in the alternate segment. But since we have a radius instead of a tangent, perhaps we can relate it.

Alternatively, consider drawing the tangent at G. Then, the angle between FG and the tangent would be equal to the angle subtended by arc FG in the alternate segment. But since we have a radius GH, which is perpendicular to the tangent at G. Wait, because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact. So, if I draw the tangent at G, then GH is perpendicular to it. So, the angle between FG and the tangent is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Let's denote that angle as α. Then, angle between FG and tangent is α. But since GH is perpendicular to the tangent, the angle between FG and GH would be 90° - α. 

But how does this help? Well, the angle in the alternate segment is equal to the angle subtended by arc FG. Wait, the angle in the alternate segment would be an inscribed angle subtended by arc FG. So, that angle would be half the measure of arc FG. Let's say that angle is γ. Then, γ = ½ arc FG. And according to the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle between FG and tangent equals γ. But we also have that angle between FG and GH (which is angle FGH) is 90° - γ. 

So, angle FGH = 90° - γ. And γ = ½ arc FG. So, angle FGH = 90° - (½ arc FG). But earlier, we found that arc FG = 180° - 2θ. So substituting:

angle FGH = 90° - (½)(180° - 2θ) = 90° - 90° + θ = θ. 

Which confirms that angle FGH is indeed θ. So this doesn't give new information, but validates the previous equations.

Hmm. Still stuck. Let's think differently. Let's consider that angle F,H,J is twice angle F,G,H. So, angle F,H,J = 2θ. Also, angle F,H,J is the central angle for arc FJ, so arc FJ = 2θ. Earlier, arc FG was 180° - 2θ. Now, if we add arc FG and arc FJ, we get (180° - 2θ) + 2θ = 180°. So, arc FG + arc FJ = 180°. This suggests that points F, G, J are arranged such that arc FG and arc FJ together make up a semicircle. So, either G and J are diametrically opposite points relative to F, or something like that. 

If arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, then the total arc from G to J passing through F is 180°, implying that G and J are endpoints of a diameter. Wait, no. Wait, if arc FG is from F to G, and arc FJ is from F to J, then adding them would imply that the arc from G to J passing through F is 180°. So, the arc GJ passing through F is 180°, meaning that G and J are endpoints of a semicircle. Hence, the arc from G to J passing through F is a semicircle, so GJ is a diameter. Wait, but H is the center. If GJ is a diameter, then H lies on GJ. 

Wait, but H is the center. So, if GJ is a diameter, then H is the midpoint of GJ. So, H would be the midpoint of GJ. But we already know that H is the center, and J is a point on the circle. So, if GJ is a diameter, then H is the midpoint of GJ, hence GH = HJ (radii). Which aligns with the given that GH and HJ are radii. 

So, if arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, then GJ is a diameter. So, H lies on GJ. Thus, points G, H, J are colinear, with H being the midpoint. So, GH = HJ. 

This seems promising. So, if GJ is a diameter, then angle F,H,J is the central angle for arc FJ, which is 2θ. And arc FG is 180° - 2θ. But since GJ is a diameter, then arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, which we've already used. 

Now, with this setup, let's consider triangle FHJ. Since H is the midpoint of GJ, and J is on the circle. Also, F is a point on the circle. So, triangle FHJ has sides FH and HJ as radii, so it's an isosceles triangle with FH=HJ. Therefore, angles at F and J are equal. Let's call those angles φ. Then, angle at H is 2θ. So, 2φ + 2θ = 180° → φ = (180° - 2θ)/2 = 90° - θ.

Now, what about triangle FGH? Earlier, we had angle at G is θ, angle at H is 180° - 2θ, and angle at F is θ. But since GJ is a diameter, and H is the midpoint, maybe there's a relationship between angle at F (in triangle FGH) and angle φ in triangle FHJ. 

Wait, in triangle FGH, angle at F is θ. In triangle FHJ, angle at F is φ = 90° - θ. So, combining these, θ + (90° - θ) = 90°. Which is consistent. 

But how does this help us find the value of θ? We need more constraints. Maybe there's another relationship involving the angles. 

Let's think about the entire diagram. Since GJ is a diameter, then any angle subtended by GJ would be a right angle. For example, angle at F subtended by GJ. Wait, if F is on the circle, then angle GFJ would be a right angle. Because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. 

Wait, yes! Since GJ is a diameter, any point F on the circle forms a right angle with G and J. So, angle GFJ = 90°. 

So, in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°. Now, let's consider triangle GFJ. We have points G, F, J. Since GJ is a diameter, and F is on the circle, triangle GFJ is a right-angled triangle at F. 

Now, let's see if we can relate this to other triangles. For example, in triangle GFJ, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. But we don't have lengths. However, maybe we can relate angles. 

In triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is angle JGF, and angle at J is angle FJG. 

We might be able to relate these angles to θ. Let's explore. 

First, note that angle JGF is angle at G between J and F. Which is angle JGF. Earlier, we had angle FGH = θ. Since H is the midpoint of GJ, GH is half of GJ. So, angle between FG and GH is θ. But angle JGF is the angle between FG and GJ. Since GH is half of GJ, angle JGF is composed of angle FGH (θ) plus angle HGF? Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

Point H is the midpoint of GJ, so GJ is straight line with H in the middle. So, angle between FG and GJ at point G is angle JGF. Which includes the angle between FG and GH (which is θ), and angle between GH and GJ. Since H is the midpoint, GH is half of GJ. But since H is the center, and J is on the circle, GJ is a diameter. So, the line GJ passes through H. So, at point G, the line GJ extends through H to J. So, angle JGF is the angle between FG and GJ. This angle is composed of angle FGH (between FG and GH) plus angle between GH and GJ. Wait, but GH is part of GJ. So, the angle between FG and GJ at point G is just angle FGH. Wait, no. Because GJ is a straight line through H. So, from point G, the line GJ goes towards J, passing through H. So, the angle between FG and GJ at G is the same as angle FGH, which is θ. Wait, but earlier we said that angle JGF is angle at G between J and F. So, if angle FGH is θ, then angle JGF is also θ. 

Wait, but in triangle GFJ, angle at G is θ, angle at F is 90°, so angle at J would be 90° - θ. 

But angle at J in triangle GFJ is angle FJG. Let's denote that as ψ. So, ψ = 90° - θ. 

Now, looking at triangle FHJ. Earlier, we had angle at J is φ = 90° - θ. But angle FJG in triangle GFJ is ψ = 90° - θ. So, angle at J in triangle FHJ is the same as angle at J in triangle GFJ. Therefore, φ = ψ. Which makes sense because both are 90° - θ. 

This doesn't give new information. Still stuck. Need another relation. 

Wait, maybe considering triangle FGH and triangle FJH. 

In triangle FGH, we have angles θ, θ, and 180° - 2θ. 

In triangle FJH, angles are φ = 90° - θ, φ = 90° - θ, and 2θ. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Wait, what about the angle at J in triangle FJH? It is φ = 90° - θ. But this angle is also part of triangle GFJ. In triangle GFJ, angle at J is ψ = 90° - θ. So, that's the same as φ. 

But still, no concrete numbers. 

Perhaps we need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point H is 360°. Let's think about the angles at H. 

At point H, we have several angles. For example, angle F,H,G (which is angle F H G = 180° - 2θ), angle F,H,J (which is 2θ), and possibly others. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if we consider that points F, G, J are arranged such that arc FG = 180° - 2θ and arc FJ = 2θ, and since arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, then arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, which implies that the total arc from G to J passing through F is 180°, making GJ a diameter. 

Thus, with GJ as a diameter, and H being the midpoint, then triangle GFJ is right-angled at F. 

Now, let's consider triangle FGH. Since angle at G is θ, and angle at F is θ, and angle at H is 180° - 2θ. 

But in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, so maybe there's a relationship between angles in triangle FGH and triangle GFJ. 

For example, angle at F in triangle FGH is θ, while angle at F in triangle GFJ is 90°. These are different angles. 

But if we consider that in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, and in triangle FGH, angle at F is θ. So, perhaps these angles are supplementary or something. 

Wait, angle at F in triangle FGH is angle GFH. While angle at F in triangle GFJ is angle JFG. Are these angles related? 

Yes! At point F, we have two angles: one is angle GFH (part of triangle FGH), and another is angle JFG (part of triangle GFJ). Together, these two angles form the total angle at point F, which is angle JFH. 

Because at point F, the lines FG, FH, and FJ come together. So, angle GFH + angle JFG = angle JFH. 

But angle JFH is part of triangle FHJ, where angle at F is φ = 90° - θ. So, angle JFH = φ = 90° - θ. 

But angle GFH is θ (from triangle FGH), and angle JFG is 90° (from triangle GFJ). So:

θ + 90° = 90° - θ 

Wait, that would mean θ + 90° = 90° - θ → θ = -θ → 2θ = 0 → θ = 0°, which is impossible. 

That suggests a contradiction, so my assumption must be wrong. 

Where did I go wrong? Let's check. 

I assumed that angle GFH (from triangle FGH) is θ. But earlier, in triangle FGH, angle at F is equal to angle at G, which is θ. Yes, because FH = GH. So angle at F is θ. 

Then, angle JFG is part of triangle GFJ, which is 90°. 

But angle JFH (at point F) is angle between JF and HF. Which would be angle JFG + angle GFH? Or subtract? 

Wait, at point F, the lines are FG, FH, and FJ. So, angle between FG and FH is angle GFH = θ. Angle between FG and FJ is angle JFG = 90°. Therefore, the angle between FH and FJ would be angle JFH = angle JFG - angle GFH = 90° - θ. Which matches φ = 90° - θ. 

Ah, I see! So, angle JFH = 90° - θ, which is the angle at F in triangle FHJ. So, this checks out. 

But this doesn't give us a numerical value for θ. So, how to find θ?

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Since angle F,H,J is 2θ, and it's the central angle for arc FJ. Also, in triangle FHJ, angle at H is 2θ. 

But if we consider triangle FHJ, it's an isosceles triangle with FH=HJ, and base angles at F and J equal to φ = 90° - θ. 

But what's the length of these sides? They are radii of the circle. So, if we assume the circle has radius r, then FH = HJ = r. 

But without actual lengths, this might not help. 

Wait, but if we consider the Law of Sines in triangle FHJ. 

Law of Sines says that in any triangle, a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C. 

In triangle FHJ, sides FH and HJ are equal (both radii), so let's denote them as r. The side FJ can be found using the Law of Cosines: FJ² = FH² + HJ² - 2*FH*HJ*cos(angle at H). Since FH=HJ=r, this becomes FJ² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(2θ) = 2r²(1 - cos(2θ)). 

But also, FJ is a chord of the circle, so its length can be expressed as 2r*sin(arc FJ / 2). Since arc FJ is 2θ, then FJ = 2r*sin(θ). 

So, setting these equal:

2r²(1 - cos(2θ)) = [2r*sin(θ)]² → 2r²(1 - cos(2θ)) = 4r²sin²θ 

Divide both sides by 2r²:

1 - cos(2θ) = 2sin²θ 

But from trigonometric identities, we know that cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ. Substituting:

1 - (1 - 2sin²θ) = 2sin²θ → 2sin²θ = 2sin²θ. Which holds true. So, no new information. 

Hmm. Still stuck. Need another approach. 

Wait, going back to the original problem: the question asks to find x, which likely refers to the measure of angle F,H,J, which is 2θ. But the answer options are A.30, B.35, C.70, D.140. 

Wait, but how do we find θ? Maybe there's a missing piece. 

Wait, previously, we considered that angle at F in triangle GFJ is 90°, and angle GFH is θ. Also, angle JFH is 90° - θ. But angle JFH is part of triangle FHJ, where angle at F is 90° - θ. 

But what about the other angles in triangle FHJ? Let me think. 

In triangle FHJ, we have angles at F and J equal to φ = 90° - θ, and angle at H is 2θ. So:

φ + φ + 2θ = 180°  
→ 2*(90° - θ) + 2θ = 180°  
→ 180° - 2θ + 2θ = 180°  
→ 180° = 180° 

Again, identity. No new info. 

Wait, maybe there's a relation between angle at H (2θ) and other angles. 

But since we don't have specific values, perhaps we need to assume that angle F,H,J is one of the given options, and work backwards. 

For example, suppose angle F,H,J is 140° (option D). Then, 2θ = 140° → θ = 70°. Then, arc FG = 180° - 2θ = 180° - 140° = 40°. Arc FJ = 2θ = 140°. Adding them gives 180°, which fits. 

But how does this help? Well, if angle F,H,J is 140°, then θ = 70°. But then, angle at G (θ) is 70°, and angle at F in triangle FGH is also 70°. 

But in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, which is the right angle. So, angle at G is θ = 70°, angle at F is 90°, so angle at J would be 20°. 

But angle at J in triangle GFJ is 20°. Also, in triangle FHJ, angle at J is φ = 90° - θ = 90° - 70° = 20°, which matches. 

So this works. So, if angle F,H,J is 140°, then everything fits. 

Similarly, if angle F,H,J is 70°, then θ = 35°, arc FG = 180° - 70° = 110°, arc FJ = 70°, totaling 180°, which also works. 

But why would the answer be one of these? The problem doesn't give specific values, but the answer choices are fixed. 

Wait, but the problem says to find x, which is likely angle F,H,J, since the question states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F,H,J)), 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H))). So, x is the measure of angle F,H,J, which is 2θ. 

But how do we determine which of the options is correct? 

Wait, perhaps there's another constraint I missed. Let's reconsider the initial setup. 

Given that point J is on the circle, and line FJ is present. Also, line HJ is a radius. So, in triangle FHJ, we have FH = HJ = r, and angle at H is 2θ. Also, in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is θ, angle at J is 90° - θ. 

But in triangle GFJ, angle at J is 90° - θ. This angle is also the angle between FJ and GJ. But GJ is a diameter, so the line GJ passes through H. So, angle at J between FJ and GJ is 90° - θ. 

But angle at J in triangle FHJ is also 90° - θ. So, this is the same angle. 

But how does this help us? 

Unless there's a relationship between angles at J in different triangles. 

Alternatively, since angle at J in triangle GFJ is 90° - θ, and angle at J in triangle FHJ is also 90° - θ, but these are the same angle. 

Wait, this doesn't provide new info. 

Maybe we need to consider that in triangle FGH, angle at G is θ, and in triangle GFJ, angle at G is θ. But angle at G in triangle GFJ is angle JGF, which is θ, and angle at G in triangle FGH is also θ. So, this is consistent. 

Still no progress. 

Wait, but if arc FG is 180° - 2θ, and arc FJ is 2θ, then the measure of arc FG is 180° - 2θ. If we assume that arc FG is equal to arc FJ, then 180° - 2θ = 2θ → 180° = 4θ → θ = 45°, so angle F,H,J = 2θ = 90°, which is not among the options. 

But this is an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific configuration where arc FG is equal to arc FJ, but that might not hold. 

Alternatively, since GJ is a diameter, and F is a point on the circle, then the angle at F (in triangle GFJ) is 90°. So, in triangle GFJ, we have a right angle at F, and angles at G and J are θ and 90° - θ. 

But in triangle FGH, angle at G is θ, and angle at F is θ. So, in triangle FGH, angle at F is θ, and in triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°. So, these two angles at F are different, but they are both at point F. 

Wait, but at point F, the angle between FG and FH is θ, and the angle between FG and FJ is 90°. So, the angle between FH and FJ is 90° - θ. 

But this is also the angle at F in triangle FHJ, which is φ = 90° - θ. 

This is consistent, but again, no new info. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the answer is one of the given choices, and test which one satisfies all conditions. 

Let's assume that angle F,H,J is 140° (option D). Then, 2θ = 140° → θ = 70°. 

Arc FG = 180° - 2θ = 180° - 140° = 40°, arc FJ = 140°. Total arc FG + arc FJ = 180°, so GJ is a diameter. 

In triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is θ = 70°, angle at J is 20°. 

In triangle FHJ, angle at H is 140°, angles at F and J are 20° each. 

This works. 

Now, let's check if this leads to any contradictions. 

Alternatively, if angle F,H,J is 70° (option C), then θ = 35°, arc FG = 180° - 70° = 110°, arc FJ = 70°, totaling 180°. 

In triangle GFJ, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is 35°, angle at J is 55°. 

In triangle FHJ, angle at H is 70°, angles at F and J are 55° each. 

This also works. 

So, both options C and D seem to fit. 

Wait, but how to choose between them? 

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that arc FG + arc FJ = 180°. Let me re-examine this. 

Earlier, we said that arc FG = 180° - 2θ and arc FJ = 2θ, so their sum is 180°. But this assumes that the arcs FG and FJ are measured in the same direction, adding up to a semicircle. But if the arcs are measured in opposite directions, it could be different. 

For example, if arc FG is measured clockwise and arc FJ is measured counterclockwise, their sum might not be 180°. But since the problem doesn't specify the order of points, we can't assume. 

However, since the problem gives that Line(F,G) is a chord, and Line(F,J) is another line. So, points G and J are distinct points on the circle, and the arcs between them depend on their positions. 

But without more info, it's ambiguous. 

Wait, but the problem also includes Line(H,J), which is a radius. So, H is the center, and J is on the circle. So, HJ is a radius. 

If we consider the configuration where GJ is a diameter, then H is the midpoint of GJ. So, H lies on GJ. 

In this case, the angle at H (angle F,H,J) is the central angle for arc FJ, which is 2θ. 

But if GJ is a diameter, then point F is somewhere on the circle. Let's imagine this configuration. 

Imagine a circle with center H. GJ is a diameter, so G and J are on opposite ends of the circle. F is another point on the circle. 

Now, angle F,H,J is the central angle for arc FJ, which is 2θ. 

Also, angle F,G,H is θ, which is the angle at G between F, G, H. 

With GJ as diameter, and F on the circle, we can use
