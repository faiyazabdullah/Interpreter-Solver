D. 60

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a pentagon ABCDE, and it's regular. Wait, but the predicates mention Regular(Polygon(A,B,C,D,E)). Hmm, but a regular pentagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. But the problem also gives several Equals statements about the lengths of the sides. Let me check those again.

The given predicates say that the length of each side is equal. For example, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))), and similarly for the other sides. So that means all the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are equal in length. And since it's a regular polygon, that makes sense because a regular pentagon has all sides equal. 

Then there's the perimeter given as 60 centimeters. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides are equal, if I call the length of one side 's', then the perimeter would be 5 times s. So, 5s = 60 cm. Solving for s would give s = 60 / 5 = 12 cm. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option A is 12. That seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions a pentagon, so five sides. Each side is equal because it's regular. Therefore, dividing the perimeter by 5 gives the length of each side. So yes, 60 divided by 5 is 12. So the answer should be A. 

But wait, maybe there's something tricky here? Like, could the polygon not be regular even though the predicates say Regular()? No, the Regular predicate is given, so that confirms it's a regular pentagon. Hence, all sides are equal. So the calculation holds. Therefore, the correct answer is A, 12.
