MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they tell me about the triangle. 

So, the problem mentions a triangle with points X, Y, Z. There are lines connecting each pair: XY, YZ, XZ. Also, there's an angle at point Y, specifically Angle(X,Y,Z). Then there are several other predicates: RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z)) means that angle at Y is a right angle. So triangle XYZ is a right-angled triangle at Y. 

Wait, but the IsHypotenuseOf(Line(X,Z), Triangle(X,Y,Z)) says that line XZ is the hypotenuse. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at Y, the hypotenuse should be the side opposite Y, which is XZ. That checks out. 

Now, looking at the lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Y)), 5) so XY is 5 units. Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,Z)), 9) so XZ is 9 units. Wait, but if it's a right-angled triangle with legs XY and YZ, and hypotenuse XZ, then according to Pythagoras, XY² + YZ² = XZ². Let me check that. 

But wait, we know XY is 5, XZ is 9. Plugging into Pythagoras: 5² + YZ² = 9² → 25 + YZ² = 81 → YZ² = 56 → YZ = √56 ≈ 7.483. But do we have any info about YZ? The predicate Perpendicular(Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z)) confirms that XY is perpendicular to YZ, which makes sense for a right angle at Y. 

So the sides are XY=5, YZ≈7.483, hypotenuse XZ=9. Now, the question asks for the measure of angle Z. In triangle XYZ, angle Z is one of the acute angles. Since it's a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90 degrees. To find angle Z, I can use trigonometry. 

In a right-angled triangle, tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent. For angle Z, the opposite side would be XY (which is 5), and the adjacent side is YZ (≈7.483). Alternatively, since angle Z is at point Z, the sides relative to angle Z are: opposite is XY (5), adjacent is YZ (√56), and hypotenuse XZ (9). Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the sides adjacent and opposite to angle Z. 

Alternatively, since angle Z is at vertex Z, the sides forming angle Z are ZY and ZX. Wait, perhaps I should label the triangle properly. Let me sketch mentally: right angle at Y, so points X-Y-Z form a right angle at Y. So, XY is one leg (length 5), YZ is another leg (length sqrt(56)), and hypotenuse XZ is 9. 

To find angle Z, which is at point Z. In triangle XYZ, angle Z is opposite to side XY (since XY is opposite angle Z). Wait, no. Let me recall: in triangle ABC, angle A is opposite BC. So here, angle Z is opposite side XY. Therefore, using sine or cosine. 

Alternatively, using tangent: tan(angle Z) = opposite / adjacent. Opposite to angle Z is XY (length 5), adjacent is YZ (sqrt(56)). So tan(angle Z) = 5 / sqrt(56). Let me compute that. 

First, calculate sqrt(56): sqrt(56) = sqrt(4*14) = 2*sqrt(14) ≈ 2*3.7417 ≈ 7.483. So tan(theta) = 5 / 7.483 ≈ 0.668. Then theta = arctan(0.668). Let me compute that. 

Calculating arctan(0.668)... Well, knowing that tan(33.7 degrees) is approximately 0.666, so maybe around 33.7 degrees. Looking at the options, B is 33.7. But let me verify more accurately. 

Alternatively, using calculator-like computation: arctan(5/sqrt(56)). Let me rationalize 5/sqrt(56) = 5√56 / 56 = 5*(2√14)/56 = (10√14)/56 = (5√14)/28 ≈ (5*3.7417)/28 ≈ 18.7085 / 28 ≈ 0.668. So yes, same as before. 

Now, arctangent of 0.668. Let me recall some standard angles. Tan(30°)=1/√3≈0.577, tan(35°)=~0.700. So 0.668 is between 30° and 35°, closer to 33.7°, which is one of the options. Let me check if there's a way to compute this more precisely. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines. Wait, but since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe easier with sine or cosine. 

Another approach: since we know all three sides, we can use the Law of Sines. For example, sin(angle Z) = opposite / hypotenuse = XY / XZ = 5 / 9 ≈ 0.555... So angle Z = arcsin(5/9). Let me compute that. 

arcsin(5/9) ≈ arcsin(0.5555). Again, sin(33.7°) is approx 0.554, which would give angle Z ≈ 33.7°, matching option B. 

Therefore, the measure of angle Z is approximately 33.7 degrees, which corresponds to choice B.
