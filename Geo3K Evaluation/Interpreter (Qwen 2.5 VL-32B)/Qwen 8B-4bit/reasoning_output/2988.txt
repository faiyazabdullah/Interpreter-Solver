MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have a triangle ABC. Points A, B, and C are defined, and there are lines AB, BC, and AC. There's also an angle at point B, specifically Angle(A, B, C), which is given as 21 degrees. Also, it says that this angle is a right angle? Wait, no—the RightAngle predicate applies to Angle(A,B,C). Wait, but the Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), 21) – wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check again.

Wait, the predicates mention: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), 21). So Angle(C) refers to angle at point C? Or is it angle ABC? Wait, the Angle predicate is written as Angle(A, B, C), which usually denotes the angle at point B between points A and C. But then there's another part where it mentions Angle(C)—maybe that's a typo or shorthand? Hmm, perhaps there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe Angle(C) refers to angle at point C. Wait, but the initial Angle(A, B, C) would be angle at B. Then, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A, B, C)), so that angle at B is a right angle. Wait, but then the measure of Angle(C) is 21. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-examine the given predicates carefully.

Let me list out all the given predicates again:

- Triangle(A, B, C): So triangle ABC exists.
- Point(A), Point(B), Point(C): All three are points.
- Line(A, B), Line(B, C), Line(A, C): These are the sides of the triangle.
- Angle(A, B, C): This is the angle at point B between points A and C. So angle ABC.
- Angle(C): Maybe this refers to angle at point C? Or could be a typo? Or perhaps it's referring to angle ACB?
- RightAngle(Angle(A, B, C)): So angle at B (angle ABC) is a right angle.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C)), 21): So MeasureOf(Angle(C)) equals 21 degrees. Assuming Angle(C) is angle at point C, which would be angle ACB.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), 11): So length AB is 11 units.
- IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A, C), Triangle(A, B, C)): So line AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. Since it's a right triangle (as angle at B is right), hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Therefore, hypotenuse is AC, so AC is the longest side. Thus, triangle ABC is right-angled at B, with hypotenuse AC.
- IsSideOf(Line(A, B), Triangle(A, B, C)): AB is a side of the triangle.
- Similarly for BC and AC being sides.
- Equals(SinOf(21), Div(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), LengthOf(Line(A, C)))): So sin(21°) equals AB / AC. Given AB = 11, so sin(21°) = 11 / AC.

So putting it all together: We have a right-angled triangle at B, with legs AB and BC, hypotenuse AC. The angle at C (angle ACB) measures 21 degrees. Wait, because Angle(C) is mentioned as having measure 21. Wait, if angle at B is 90 degrees, then angles at A and C must add up to 90. If angle at C is 21 degrees, then angle at A would be 69 degrees. 

But how does that relate to the sine ratio? The given equation is sin(21°) = AB / AC. Wait, AB is one of the legs. In a right-angled triangle, sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse. For angle at C, which is 21 degrees, the opposite side would be AB. Because in triangle ABC, angle at C: opposite side is AB. Hypotenuse is AC. So yes, sin(angle C) = AB / AC. Which matches the given equation. So that gives us:

sin(21°) = AB / AC → AB = AC × sin(21°)

We know AB is 11, so:

11 = AC × sin(21°)

Therefore, AC = 11 / sin(21°)

Calculating that value. Let me compute sin(21°). Using calculator, sin(21°) ≈ 0.3584. So AC ≈ 11 / 0.3584 ≈ 30.7. Looking at the answer choices, D is 30.7. So the answer should be D. Let me verify once more.

Wait, but angle at C is 21 degrees. So angle C is 21°, making angle at A = 90 - 21 = 69°. Then, in triangle ABC, with right angle at B. So AB is adjacent to angle C. Wait, no: angle at C is 21°, so the sides relative to angle C are: opposite side is AB, adjacent side is BC, hypotenuse AC. So yes, sin(angle C) = opposite / hypotenuse = AB / AC. Hence, AB = AC × sin(21°). Therefore, solving for AC gives AC = AB / sin(21°). Plugging numbers: 11 divided by sin(21°). Calculating sin(21°):

Using calculator input: 21 degrees. Sin(21) ≈ 0.3583679...

So 11 / 0.3583679 ≈ 30.7. Which matches answer choice D. So the answer is D.
