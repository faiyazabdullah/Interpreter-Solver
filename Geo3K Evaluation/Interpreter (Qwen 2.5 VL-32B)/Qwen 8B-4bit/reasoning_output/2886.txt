<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD circumscribed around a circle O. That means it's a tangential quadrilateral, right? And all four points A, B, C, D lie on the circle O. Also, there are some angle measures and arc measures given. The question is asking for the measure of angle D, which I assume is ∠ADC or something like that. Let me start breaking down the given information step by step.

First, the quadrilateral ABCD is circumscribed about circle O. In such cases, there's a property that the sums of the lengths of opposite sides are equal. But wait, here we're dealing with arcs and angles, so maybe that's not directly applicable yet. However, since all vertices lie on the circle, this quadrilateral is also cyclic? Wait, hold on—wait, if a quadrilateral is both cyclic (all vertices on a circle) and tangential (has an incircle), then it's called bicentric. But does that affect our current problem?

Wait, but the problem says the quadrilateral is circumscribed to the circle, meaning the circle is tangent to all four sides. So, ABCD is a tangential quadrilateral. However, the fact that all four points lie on the same circle (the circle O) suggests that it's cyclic. Therefore, ABCD is both cyclic and tangential. Hmm, interesting. For bicentric quadrilaterals, there are relations between the radii of the incircle and circumcircle, but perhaps more importantly, there are relations between the angles and arcs.

But let's look at the given angle measures. We know that measure of angle A is 58 degrees. Also, there are several arc measures given. Let me note them down:

Arc BD = 3y + 4
Arc BC = 2x
Arc DC = 2y + 16
Sum of all arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360 degrees (since they make up the whole circle).
Also, Arc BD equals twice the measure of angle A. Since angle A is 58°, then Arc BD is 2*58=116°. So, setting that equal to 3y +4 gives us 3y +4 = 116. Solving for y: 3y = 112 → y = 112/3 ≈ 37.333... Maybe fractions are okay here, but let's keep it symbolic for now.

So, Arc BD is 116°, which is given by 3y+4. Then, Arc BC is 2x, Arc DC is 2y +16. Now, the sum of all arcs is 360°, so:

Arc AB + Arc BC + Arc CD + Arc DA = 360°

But how do we find these arcs? Let me think. Since ABCD is cyclic, each arc corresponds to the central angle subtending it. Also, the inscribed angles over those arcs relate to the angles of the quadrilateral. Wait, but angle A is given as 58°, which is an inscribed angle. Wait, angle A is formed by chords AB and AD. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, yes! For a cyclic quadrilateral, each interior angle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle.

Wait, let me recall the formula: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. For example, angle A intercepts arcs BC and CD? Or wait, angle A is formed by chords AB and AD, so the intercepted arcs would be arc BCD and arc BAD? No, wait, the angle at vertex A intercepts arc BCD because the angle is formed by chords AB and AD, so the intercepted arc is the one opposite, which would be arc BCD. Wait, actually, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at A intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is arc BCD. Wait, but angle A is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, no, the formula is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, in a cyclic quadrilateral, each internal angle is half the difference of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact theorem.

Alternatively, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180°, but that applies when the quadrilateral is cyclic. However, in this case, since ABCD is both cyclic and tangential, maybe other properties come into play. But let me focus on the arcs and angles.

Given that angle A is 58°, and it's an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle A is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, but if ABCD is cyclic, then angle A is indeed an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle A is formed by chords AB and AD. The intercepted arc would be arc BCD. Wait, the measure of angle A is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, maybe another way: the measure of angle A is half the measure of the arc opposite to angle A. Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180°, so angle A + angle C = 180°, and angle B + angle D = 180°. But again, how does this relate to arcs?

Alternatively, maybe I should use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But angle A is not necessarily an inscribed angle unless the point lies on the circumference. Wait, but ABCD is cyclic, so all points are on the circle. Therefore, angle A is an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle A is formed by chords AB and AD. So, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite angle A, which is arc BCD. Wait, but the measure of angle A would be half the measure of arc BCD. Wait, but arc BCD is composed of arcs BC, CD, and DB? Wait, no, arc BCD would be arc BC plus arc CD? Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In a circle, an inscribed angle intercepts an arc that is opposite to the angle. For angle A, which is at vertex A, the intercepted arc is the arc that doesn't contain A. So, the arc BCDA? Wait, no. Let me draw mentally: points A, B, C, D arranged on the circle. Angle at A is between BA and DA. So, the intercepted arc would be the arc from B to D that doesn't pass through A. Which is arc BCD? Wait, if moving from B to D passing through C, which is arc BCD. So, the measure of angle A would be half the measure of arc BCD. Similarly, angle B would be half the measure of arc ADC, and so on.

Therefore, angle A = ½ (arc BCD). Similarly, angle D would be ½ (arc ABC).

But we know that angle A is 58°, so:

Measure of arc BCD = 2 * 58° = 116°, which matches the earlier conclusion that arc BD is 116°, but wait, arc BCD includes arc BC and arc CD. Wait, arc BD is different. Wait, arc BD could be the minor arc BD or major arc BD. But since angle A intercepts arc BCD, which is the arc from B to D passing through C. So, arc BCD is arc BC + arc CD. Therefore, arc BC + arc CD = 116°. 

But we were told that arc BD (which is likely the arc from B to D not containing C, i.e., the minor arc BD) is equal to 3y +4. Earlier, we found that arc BD = 116°, so 3y +4 = 116 ⇒ y = (116 -4)/3 = 112/3 ≈ 37.333...

Now, arc BC is given as 2x, and arc DC is 2y +16. From above, arc BC + arc CD = 116°, so substituting arc CD as 2y +16 and arc BC as 2x:

2x + (2y +16) = 116 ⇒ 2x + 2y = 116 -16 = 100 ⇒ x + y = 50. So equation (1): x + y = 50.

Also, we have the total sum of all arcs being 360°. Let's denote the arcs as follows:

Arc AB = ?
Arc BC = 2x
Arc CD = 2y +16
Arc DA = ?

But we need expressions for all arcs. Let me consider that the entire circle is 360°, so:

Arc AB + Arc BC + Arc CD + Arc DA = 360°

We already have Arc BC and Arc CD expressed in terms of x and y. What about Arc AB and Arc DA?

Let me think. Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the arcs correspond to the arcs between consecutive points. So, arc AB is between A and B, arc BC between B and C, arc CD between C and D, arc DA between D and A.

We also have the arc BD mentioned earlier. Arc BD could be arc BCD (which we've considered as 116°) or arc BAD. But since angle A intercepts arc BCD (the one not containing A), then arc BD (the minor arc) is 116°, which is the same as arc BC + arc CD. So, arc BD is 116°, and arc BAD is the rest of the circle. Wait, arc BAD would be arc BA + arc AD. Let me check that.

Alternatively, since the total circle is 360°, the arc BD (minor) is 116°, so the remaining arc (major arc BD) is 360 - 116 = 244°. But how does that help?

Wait, but perhaps we can express arc AB and arc DA in terms of other variables. Let me see.

Since arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°, and we have arc BC = 2x, arc CD = 2y +16, so:

arc AB + arc DA = 360 - (2x + 2y +16) = 360 - (2(x + y) +16)

From equation (1), x + y = 50, so substituting:

arc AB + arc DA = 360 - (2*50 +16) = 360 - (100 +16) = 360 - 116 = 244°.

So, arc AB + arc DA = 244°. But how can we find individual values of arc AB and arc DA?

Alternatively, maybe we can find other equations. Let me think about angle D. The measure of angle D is ½ the measure of arc ABC (since angle D is formed by chords DC and DA, intercepting arc ABC). So:

measure of angle D = ½ (arc ABC)

Arc ABC consists of arc AB + arc BC. So, arc AB + arc BC = arc ABC.

Thus, angle D = ½(arc AB + arc BC) = ½(arc AB + 2x)

But we need to find arc AB. How?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation involving arc AB and arc DA. Since the quadrilateral is tangential, there might be some relations between the arcs. Wait, but tangential quadrilaterals have the property that the sums of the lengths of opposite sides are equal. However, here we are dealing with arcs, not side lengths. Maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, there are relations between the arcs and the tangent segments.

Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of two opposite sides are equal. But since this is a cyclic quadrilateral as well, there might be relations between the arcs. Let me think. For example, in a bicentric quadrilateral, there's a relationship between the inradius, the distance between centers, etc., but perhaps more importantly, the existence of both incircle and circumcircle imposes certain conditions on the arcs.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But again, not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is tangential, there exists an incircle tangent to all four sides. In such a case, the lengths of the tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency satisfy certain properties. However, since we are working with arcs and angles, maybe this isn't directly applicable. Let me try to think differently.

Let me recap. We have:

1. arc BD (minor) = 116°, so 3y +4 = 116 ⇒ y = 112/3 ≈ 37.333...
2. arc BC = 2x
3. arc CD = 2y +16
4. arc BC + arc CD = 116° ⇒ 2x + 2y +16 = 116 ⇒ 2x + 2y = 100 ⇒ x + y = 50
5. Total arcs sum to 360° ⇒ arc AB + arc DA = 244°

But how to get arc AB and arc DA? Let me think about angle D. As mentioned earlier, angle D is ½(arc ABC). Arc ABC is arc AB + arc BC. So, angle D = ½(arc AB + arc BC). Let me write that as:

∠D = (arc AB + arc BC)/2

Similarly, angle A was ½(arc BCD) = ½(arc BC + arc CD) = ½(116°) = 58°, which checks out.

So, if I can find arc AB, then I can compute angle D.

But how to find arc AB? Let me consider another angle. For instance, angle B. Wait, but we don't know the measure of angle B or angle C. However, since ABCD is cyclic, angle B + angle D = 180°, and angle A + angle C = 180°. But angle A is 58°, so angle C = 122°. However, angle C can also be expressed in terms of arcs. Let's see.

Angle C is formed by chords CB and CD, so it intercepts arc BAD. Therefore, measure of angle C = ½(arc BAD). Arc BAD is arc BA + arc AD. From earlier, arc AB + arc DA = 244°, so arc BAD = arc BA + arc AD = arc AB + arc DA = 244°. Hence, angle C = ½(244°) = 122°, which matches the previous result. So that's consistent.

But how does that help us? Well, maybe we can find another equation involving arc AB and arc DA. Let me think. Since the quadrilateral is tangential, there might be some relations between the arcs. Alternatively, maybe considering that the incircle touches each side, and thus the lengths of the tangent segments from each vertex to the points of tangency are equal. But again, how does that translate to arcs?

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the measure of an arc relates to the length of the chord. But without knowing the actual lengths, this seems tricky.

Wait, but maybe there's another relation. Let's think about the arcs again. We have:

Total of arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°.

We have arc BC = 2x, arc CD = 2y +16, and arc AB + arc DA = 244°.

But we need another equation to relate arc AB and arc DA. Let me think about angle D again. If we can express angle D in terms of arc AB and arc BC, and possibly other arcs?

Wait, angle D = ½(arc ABC) = ½(arc AB + arc BC) = ½(arc AB + 2x). So, if we can find arc AB, we can calculate angle D. But how?

Alternatively, maybe looking at angle B. Let me try that. Angle B is formed by chords AB and BC, so it intercepts arc ADC. The measure of angle B is ½(arc ADC). Arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC. So, arc ADC = arc AD + arc DC. We know arc DC is 2y +16. Let me denote arc AD as z, and arc AB as w. Then:

arc AB = w, arc BC = 2x, arc CD = 2y +16, arc DA = z.

Then, w + 2x + (2y +16) + z = 360°, and from before, w + z = 244°, so:

w + z = 244°, and 2x + 2y +16 = 116°, which gives x + y = 50°, as before.

But we still have too many variables. However, if we can find another equation involving w and z, we can solve for them. Let me think.

Angle B is ½(arc ADC) = ½(z + (2y +16)). Similarly, angle D is ½(w + 2x). Also, since ABCD is cyclic, angle B + angle D = 180°, so:

[½(z + 2y +16)] + [½(w + 2x)] = 180°

Multiply both sides by 2:

z + 2y +16 + w + 2x = 360°

But we know that w + z = 244°, and 2x + 2y = 100°, from earlier. So substituting:

(w + z) + 2x + 2y +16 = 244 + 100 + 16 = 360°, which checks out. So that doesn't give new info.

Hmm, stuck here. Need another equation. Perhaps considering angle C? Angle C is 122°, as before. Angle C is formed by chords CB and CD, intercepting arc BAD. So, measure of angle C is ½(arc BAD) = ½(w + z) = ½(244°) = 122°, which matches. Again, no new info.

What else? Let me check if there's another arc that we haven't used. The arc AB is w, and arc DA is z. Is there any other given arc measures? The problem mentions Arc(B,D) = 3y +4, which we've already used. Arc(B,C)=2x, Arc(D,C)=2y+16. Are there others? Not directly stated. But perhaps the arcs corresponding to the other angles?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of the arcs adjacent to each side relates to the tangent lengths. Wait, but since it's cyclic and tangential, there's a relation between the arcs and the tangent segments. However, without knowing the actual lengths of the sides, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, but in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the sides can be expressed in terms of the tangent segments. For example, if the incircle touches AB at P, BC at Q, CD at R, and DA at S, then AP = AS = p, BP = BQ = q, CQ = CR = r, DR = DS = s. And the sides are AB = p + q, BC = q + r, CD = r + s, DA = s + p. Also, since it's tangential, AB + CD = BC + DA. Which implies that (p + q) + (r + s) = (q + r) + (s + p), which is always true, so that's just confirming the condition.

But how does this relate to arcs? Well, the arcs might not directly relate to the tangent lengths, but perhaps there's a connection between the arcs and the angles. Wait, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe considering the fact that the arcs correspond to the central angles. Each arc has a central angle equal to its measure. So, the central angles for arcs AB, BC, CD, DA are w, 2x, 2y +16, z respectively. Their sum is 360°, as before.

But again, not enough info. Wait, but maybe there's another relation. Since the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, there's a formula connecting the angles. For bicentric quadrilaterals, there's a relation between the inradius, circumradius, and the distances between centers, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a bicentric quadrilateral, the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals plus 8R² or something like that. But again, not helpful without side lengths.

Wait, but maybe I can find another equation using the arcs. Let me think about the measure of angle A again. It was given as 58°, which is ½(arc BCD) = ½(BC + CD) = ½(2x + 2y +16) = x + y +8. Wait, earlier we had arc BC + arc CD = 2x + 2y +16? Wait, no. Arc BC is 2x, arc CD is 2y +16. So their sum is 2x + 2y +16. But earlier, we said that arc BC + arc CD = 116°, so:

2x + 2y +16 = 116 ⇒ 2x + 2y = 100 ⇒ x + y = 50. Correct.

But angle A is ½(arc BCD) = ½(2x + 2y +16)? Wait, no. Wait, arc BCD is arc BC + arc CD. Wait, arc BC is 2x, arc CD is 2y +16, so arc BCD = 2x + 2y +16. Wait, but earlier we said that angle A is ½(arc BCD) = 58°, so:

½(2x + 2y +16) = 58 ⇒ 2x + 2y +16 = 116 ⇒ 2x + 2y = 100 ⇒ x + y = 50. Which is consistent with earlier.

So, that's where the 116 came from. So, that's confirmed.

Now, back to angle D. We need to find angle D, which is ½(arc ABC). Arc ABC is arc AB + arc BC. Arc AB is w, arc BC is 2x. So, angle D = ½(w + 2x).

So, if I can find w + 2x, then divide by 2 to get angle D.

But how?

We know that w + z = 244°, and we need to find w. Let me see if I can express z in terms of other variables.

From arc DA = z, and arc DA is part of the circle. Also, arc DA is connected to angle D and angle A. Wait, maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe using another angle. Let me think about angle D again. If angle D is ½(w + 2x), then angle D = (w + 2x)/2. If I can find w + 2x, that would solve it.

But how?

Wait, maybe there's another relation. Let me think about the arc BD. Arc BD is 116°, which we have already used. But arc BD can also be expressed as arc BA + arc AD, which is arc AB + arc DA = w + z = 244°, but that contradicts the previous statement that arc BD is 116°. Wait, no. Wait, arc BD is either the minor arc BD (which is 116°) or the major arc BD (which would be 360 - 116 = 244°). So, arc BD is the minor arc, which is 116°, while arc BAD is the major arc BD, which is 244°. So, arc BAD = arc BA + arc AD = w + z = 244°, which matches. Thus, arc BA + arc AD = 244°, which we already have.

But how to connect this with angle D? Let me think again. Angle D is formed by chords DC and DA, intercepting arc ABC. So, arc ABC = arc AB + arc BC = w + 2x. So, angle D = (w + 2x)/2.

But how to find w + 2x?

Let me think about the arc DA. Arc DA is z. Also, arc DA is part of the circle. Can I relate z to something else? Let me consider angle A. Wait, angle A is 58°, which we've already used. Or maybe angle A is related to other arcs?

Alternatively, think about the other arcs. For example, arc AB is w, arc BC is 2x, arc CD is 2y +16, arc DA is z. We have:

w + 2x + (2y +16) + z = 360°  
=> w + z + 2x + 2y +16 = 360°  
From earlier, we have w + z = 244°, and 2x + 2y = 100°, so:

244 + 100 +16 = 360° → 360° = 360°, which checks out.

Still no new info.

Wait, but maybe I can find another equation by considering angle D. Suppose I can express angle D in terms of other angles. Since ABCD is cyclic, angle D + angle B = 180°. So, if I can find angle B, then I can find angle D.

How to find angle B? Angle B is formed by chords AB and BC, so it intercepts arc ADC. Arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC = z + (2y +16). Thus, measure of angle B = ½(z + 2y +16). 

So, angle B = ½(z + 2y +16). And since angle B + angle D = 180°, we have:

angle D = 180° - angle B = 180° - ½(z + 2y +16)

But angle D is also equal to ½(w + 2x). So:

½(w + 2x) = 180° - ½(z + 2y +16)

Multiply both sides by 2:

w + 2x = 360° - (z + 2y +16)

Rearrange:

w + 2x + z + 2y +16 = 360°

Which simplifies to:

(w + z) + 2x + 2y +16 = 360°

Again, this is the same equation we've had before, which is satisfied since w + z = 244°, 2x + 2y = 100°, adding 16 gives 244 + 100 +16 = 360. So again, no new info.

This seems like going in circles. Maybe I need to find another equation involving w and x.

Wait, but earlier we have x + y = 50, and y = 112/3. Let me compute y first. Since 3y +4 = 116 => y = (116 -4)/3 = 112/3 ≈ 37.333...

So y = 112/3. Then, from x + y = 50, x = 50 - y = 50 - 112/3 = (150/3 - 112/3) = 38/3 ≈ 12.666...

So x = 38/3.

So, now we can substitute these values into other expressions.

Arc BC = 2x = 2*(38/3) = 76/3 ≈ 25.333...

Arc CD = 2y +16 = 2*(112/3) +16 = 224/3 + 48/3 = 272/3 ≈ 90.666...

Now, arc BC + arc CD = 76/3 + 272/3 = 348/3 = 116°, which matches the earlier calculation.

Now, we need to find arc AB and arc DA, whose sum is 244°. Let me denote arc AB as w and arc DA as z. So, w + z = 244°.

But how to find w or z? Let me think about angle D. Angle D = ½(w + 2x). Since we know x = 38/3, then 2x = 76/3. So angle D = ½(w + 76/3). But we need to find w.

But how?

Wait, if we can find another expression for angle D. Let me think about the arc DA. Arc DA is z, which is part of the circle. Also, angle D is formed by chords DC and DA, intercepting arc ABC. But perhaps there's another way to express angle D?

Alternatively, since we know arc CD = 2y +16 = 272/3°, and arc BC = 76/3°, and arc AB + arc DA = 244°, maybe we can find arc AB via another relation.

Wait, what about the arc AB? Arc AB is part of the circle. Let me consider angle A. Wait, angle A is 58°, which is ½(arc BCD) = ½(BC + CD) = ½(76/3 + 272/3) = ½(348/3) = ½(116) = 58°, which checks out. So that's consistent.

But how about angle D? Let me think if there's another arc that involves angle D. Or maybe the arc that's opposite to angle D? Wait, angle D is at vertex D, formed by chords CD and DA. So, it intercepts arc ABC. Arc ABC is arc AB + arc BC = w + 76/3. So, angle D = ½(w + 76/3).

But we need to find w. Let me think. Since w + z = 244°, and z is arc DA. Is there a way to express z?

Alternatively, consider angle A. Wait, angle A is 58°, and angle A is formed by chords AB and AD, so it intercepts arc BCD, which we've already used. 

Alternatively, think about the arc AB. If we can express arc AB in terms of other arcs. Let me think about the arc AB. It's part of the circle. Is there a way to link it to angle B or angle D?

Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is tangential, perhaps there's a relation between the arcs. Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides are equal. But since it's cyclic, the sum of opposite angles are supplementary. But how does this relate to arcs?

Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the sides can be expressed in terms of the tangent lengths, but since it's cyclic, we can also relate the sides to the arcs. But without knowing the actual lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But again, without side lengths, not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that the arcs correspond to central angles. Let me think. The central angle for arc AB is w, for arc BC is 2x, for arc CD is 2y +16, and for arc DA is z. These add up to 360°, as before.

But again, we need another equation. Let me think: since the quadrilateral is tangential, maybe the arcs have certain properties. For example, in a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of the arcs between the points of tangency... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between the arcs and the angles of the quadrilateral. For example, in a tangential quadrilateral, the angles can be related to the arcs. But since it's also cyclic, the angles are related to the arcs as discussed earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the arcs can be linked to the angles of the quadrilateral. For example, angle A is 58°, which is related to arc BCD (116°), and angle D is related to arc ABC. But without knowing arc AB, we can't proceed.

Wait, maybe we can find arc AB using the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we know the other arcs except for arc AB and arc DA. But we already know that arc AB + arc DA = 244°, and we need to find arc AB. 

Is there a missing piece of information? Let me review the given predicates again.

The problem gives:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(B,D)), 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(A))) → which gave us arc BD = 116°, leading to y = 112/3.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(B,C)), 2x)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(D,C)), 2y +16)
- SumOf(all arcs) = 360°
- The quadrilateral is circumscribed to circle O, hence tangential.

But there's no mention of arc AB or arc DA directly. So, perhaps there's another arc that we haven't considered. Let me think about the arcs involved in the angles.

Wait, angle D is ½(arc ABC) = ½(w + 2x). If I can find w, I can compute angle D. But how?

Wait, maybe there's another arc that involves angle D. Let me think about angle D. It's also part of the quadrilateral, so maybe using the fact that the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. 

Yes! The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°. We know angle A is 58°, angle C is 122°, as previously determined. So, angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360°. Substituting known values:

58° + angle B + 122° + angle D = 360°  
→ angle B + angle D = 360 - (58 + 122) = 360 - 180 = 180°, which confirms that angle B + angle D = 180°, as expected for a cyclic quadrilateral. Still no new info.

But we can express angle B and angle D in terms of arcs:

angle B = ½(z + 2y +16)  
angle D = ½(w + 2x)  
and w + z = 244°

So:

angle B + angle D = ½(z + 2y +16) + ½(w + 2x) = ½[(z + w) + 2y +16 + 2x] = ½[244 + 2y +16 + 2x] = ½[244 + 2(y + x) +16]. Since x + y = 50, this becomes ½[244 + 2*50 +16] = ½[244 + 100 +16] = ½[360] = 180°, which checks out. Again, no new info.

At this point, it seems I'm missing an equation to solve for w. Let me think if there's any other given information. The problem states that the quadrilateral is circumscribed about the circle, so it's a tangential quadrilateral. In such a case, there's a relation between the arcs and the tangent lengths. Let me explore this.

In a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the sides are related to the tangent segments. Let me denote the tangent lengths from each vertex to the points of tangency as follows:

Let the incircle touch AB at P, BC at Q, CD at R, DA at S. Then:

AP = AS = p  
BP = BQ = q  
CQ = CR = r  
DR = DS = s  

Then, the sides are:

AB = AP + BP = p + q  
BC = BQ + CQ = q + r  
CD = CR + DR = r + s  
DA = DS + AS = s + p  

And the condition for tangential quadrilateral is AB + CD = BC + DA, which gives:

(p + q) + (r + s) = (q + r) + (s + p) → which is always true, so no new info.

But how does this relate to arcs? Well, the arcs might not directly relate to the tangent lengths, but perhaps there's a relation between the arcs and the angles of the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, there might be a relation between the arcs and the tangent lengths. However, I'm not familiar with a direct formula linking them. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a bicentric quadrilateral, the sum of the reciprocals of the inradius and the circumradius satisfies a certain condition, but this seems too advanced and likely not helpful here.

Wait, maybe I need to make an assumption here. Since we have arc AB + arc DA = 244°, and we need to find arc AB. Is there any constraint on arc AB? For example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, each arc must be positive, and less than 360°, but that's trivial.

Alternatively, maybe the arc AB is related to angle B or angle D somehow. For example, angle B is ½(z + 2y +16), and angle D is ½(w + 2x). But without knowing z or w, I can't proceed.

Wait, but we know that arc AB is w, and arc DA is z. And w + z = 244. If I can find another equation involving w and z, I can solve for them. Let me think about the arc DA. Arc DA is z, which is part of the circle. Is there any other arc that involves z?

For example, arc DA is part of the circle. If I consider angle A, which is formed by chords AB and AD, intercepting arc BCD (which we already used). Or angle D, which is formed by chords DC and DA, intercepting arc ABC. 

Alternatively, think about the arc DA and angle C. Angle C is 122°, which is ½(arc BAD) = ½(w + z) = ½(244) = 122°, which is correct. So, no new info.

At this point, I think I'm stuck. All the equations I have lead to identities, and I cannot find a way to isolate w or z. But since the problem gives answer choices, maybe I can find angle D in terms of x and y, and substitute the known values.

Recall that angle D = ½(w + 2x). And w + z = 244°, and z is arc DA. But how to express w?

Wait, let me try expressing w in terms of z: w = 244 - z. So, angle D = ½((244 - z) + 2x). But without knowing z, this doesn't help.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between z and other arcs. Let me think about arc DA. Arc DA is z. This arc is part of the circle, and it's also related to angle B. Angle B = ½(z + 2y +16). But angle B is also supplementary to angle D. So, angle B = 180° - angle D. So:

180° - angle D = ½(z + 2y +16)

Substitute angle D = ½(w + 2x):

180° - ½(w + 2x) = ½(z + 2y +16)

Multiply both sides by 2:

360° - (w + 2x) = z + 2y +16

Rearranged:

w + 2x + z + 2y = 360° -16 = 344°

But we know that w + z = 244°, and 2x + 2y = 100°, so adding them:

244 + 100 = 344°, which matches. Again, no new info.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that the arcs are related to the angles of the quadrilateral. Let me think about angle D again. If I can find arc AB, then I can find angle D. But how?

Wait, maybe using the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the angles are related to the arcs. For example, in a tangential quadrilateral, the angles can be expressed in terms of the arcs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, maybe there's a relation between the arcs. For example, in a bicentric quadrilateral, the sum of the measures of the arcs between the points of tangency. But I don't recall such a formula.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's try to assign numerical values to x and y, then try to find angle D.

We have y = 112/3 ≈ 37.333..., x = 38/3 ≈ 12.666...

Now, arc BC = 2x = 76/3 ≈ 25.333°, arc CD = 2y +16 = 272/3 ≈ 90.666°, arc BC + arc CD = 116°, which is correct.

Now, the total of all arcs is 360°, so arc AB + arc DA = 244°. Let me call arc AB = w, arc DA = z = 244 - w.

Now, angle D = ½(w + 2x) = ½(w + 76/3).

But I need to find w. Is there any other relation? Let me think about the arc DA. Arc DA is z = 244 - w. This arc DA is also part of the circle. Let me think about the angle at D. Wait, angle D is formed by chords DC and DA, so it intercepts arc ABC, which is w + arc BC = w + 76/3. So, angle D = ½(w + 76/3).

But how to find w? Let me think about the arc AB. Arc AB is w. If I can relate this to another angle. For example, angle A is formed by chords AB and AD, intercepting arc BCD = 116°, which we've already used. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between arc AB and angle B or angle D. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since I have no other equations, maybe I can assume that the remaining arcs are arbitrary, but since the answer choices are fixed, maybe I can plug in possible values for angle D and see which fits.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 58, B. 64, C. 80, D. 82.

Let me assume angle D is one of these options and see if it leads to consistency.

Let's say angle D is 82° (option D). Then, according to the formula:

angle D = ½(w + 2x) = 82° → w + 2x = 164°

We know 2x = 76/3 ≈ 25.333°, so w = 164 - 76/3 = convert 164 to thirds: 164 = 492/3, so w = 492/3 - 76/3 = 416/3 ≈ 138.666°

Then, arc AB = w = 416/3°, arc DA = z = 244 - w = 244 - 416/3 = (732 - 416)/3 = 316/3 ≈ 105.333°

Now, let's check if this leads to any contradictions. For example, angle B = 180° - angle D = 180 - 82 = 98°. Angle
