MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and see how it connects. Let's start by listing out the points and lines mentioned.

We have several points: D, W, X, Y, Z, C, G, H, I, J, L. Then there are lines connecting them: D-W, W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-C, forming a straight line from D to C through W, X, Y, Z? Wait, because PointLiesOnLine checks if W, X, Y, Z are on line D-C. So that means points D, W, X, Y, Z, C are colinear in that order? Because each consecutive point is connected by a line segment. So D to W, then W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to C. So the entire line DC has these points in order: D, W, X, Y, Z, C.

Then there's another set of lines starting at J: J-G, G-H, H-I, I-J, J-L. Also, Triangle(J,G,H) and Triangle(J,I,L). And Parallel(Line(G,H), Line(I,L)). Also, Angle(W,X,J) is 130 degrees, Angle(W,Z,G) is 20 degrees, Angle(J,L,C) is 20 degrees. Also, RatioOf(LengthOf(IJ)/XJ) equals RatioOf(HJ/YJ). 

So the main goal is to find measure of angle YIZ. Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

First, considering points D, W, X, Y, Z, C on a straight line. So DC is a straight line with those points in order. Now, point J is connected to X via line XJ? Or maybe J is somewhere off the line DC? Wait, the lines involving J are J-G, G-H, H-I, I-J, J-L. Also, Triangle(J,G,H) and Triangle(J,I,L). Also, Line(I,J) is part of the structure. Also, there's a ratio given: IJ/XJ equals HJ/YJ. So that suggests that triangles may be involved here, perhaps similar triangles?

Also, note that Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L). Since they're parallel, corresponding angles might be equal. Also, angles at J: angle WXJ is 130°, so that's the angle at point X between lines WX and XJ. Wait, no—angle WXJ would be at point X? Wait, angle notation: angle(W,X,J) means vertex at X, with sides going to W and J. So that's angle at X between W and J. Similarly, angle(W,Z,G) is at Z between W and G. And angle(J,L,C) is at L between J and C.

But the question asks for angle YIZ. That would be the angle at point I between points Y and Z. Hmm. So we need to find ∠YIZ.

Let me think about the given ratios first. The ratio IJ / XJ equals HJ / YJ. This looks like the condition for similar triangles or maybe the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), which states that if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. But here, the ratio involves segments from different parts of the diagram.

Wait, but maybe there are triangles where these ratios apply. For example, if there are triangles sharing a common angle, or if lines are parallel, creating similar triangles. Also, since GH is parallel to IL, which is given. So Line(GH) || Line(IL).

Given that, maybe some triangles are similar. Let me consider triangle JGH and triangle JIL? Or perhaps other triangles.

Alternatively, looking at the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me write that as IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. Which implies that triangles IJH and XJY are similar? Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe triangle IJH ~ triangle XJY? Wait, but unless certain angles are equal.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, then maybe alternate interior angles are equal. Let me think about the coordinates or positions of these points.

Another thing: Points W, X, Y, Z are on line DC. So DC is a straight line with W, X, Y, Z in order. Let me assume that D----W----X----Y----Z----C. So DC is a straight line.

Now, point J is connected to X (since there's a line XJ?), wait, no. The lines given are Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), etc., but also Line(J,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,I), Line(I,J), Line(J,L). So J is connected to G, H, I, L. Also, Triangle(J,G,H) exists, so J, G, H form a triangle. Similarly, Triangle(J,I,L) exists. Also, Line(I,J) is present. Also, Line(J,L) is present.

Additionally, Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L). So GH || IL.

Since GH || IL, then the corresponding angles formed by transversal JL would be equal. For instance, angle between GH and JL is equal to angle between IL and JL. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, given that angle WXJ is 130°, which is at point X between W and J. Since W is on DC, and J is connected to X. So from point X, there's a line to J, making an angle of 130° with the line WX (which is along DC). Therefore, the direction from X to J is such that angle between WX (along DC towards W) and XJ is 130°, implying that J is above or below the line DC. Assuming standard position, probably above.

Similarly, angle WZG is 20°, at point Z between W and G. Since Z is on DC, so line ZG forms an angle of 20° with line ZW (which is along DC towards W). So again, G is likely above DC.

Angle JLC is 20°, at point L between J and C. So line JL and LC make a 20° angle at L. Since C is on DC, so LC is part of DC extended? Or maybe L is connected to C? Wait, Line(J,L) is given. So point L is connected to J, and also angle JLC is 20°, which is at L between J and C. So from point L, lines LJ and LC form a 20° angle. Since C is on DC, and L is connected to J, which is connected to other points.

Now, the key ratios: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me denote this ratio as k. So IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ => IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. So cross multiplying gives IJ*YJ = HJ*XJ. Which could suggest that triangles involving these segments are similar or something.

Alternatively, maybe triangle IJH and triangle XJY are similar? Because the sides around the angle at J would be proportional. But need to check the angles.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, then maybe triangle JGH is similar to triangle JIL? Wait, GH || IL, so maybe triangle JGH and JIL have some relation. Let me think.

If GH || IL, then the angles formed by the transversal JL would be equal. For example, angle between GH and JL is equal to angle between IL and JL. So maybe angle JHG equals angle JLI? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, then the slopes of GH and IL are equal, so maybe some similarity or proportionality.

Alternatively, looking at the triangles involving J. We have triangles JGH and JIL. Given that GH || IL, then maybe those triangles are similar. Let me check.

In triangle JGH and triangle JIL, if angles at J are common? No, because GH and IL are parallel, but the triangles share point J. Wait, triangle JGH has vertices J, G, H. Triangle JIL has vertices J, I, L. Are these triangles similar? It depends on angles. If GH || IL, then angle at J between JG and JH (in triangle JGH) would correspond to angle at J between JI and JL (in triangle JIL)? Not necessarily directly.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, then maybe the triangles JGH and JIL are similar by AA similarity. But need to confirm angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangles JIG and JYL are similar? Not sure.

But let's focus back on the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me think of this as a proportion where IJ corresponds to HJ and XJ corresponds to YJ. This resembles the proportionality in similar triangles where corresponding sides are proportional. So if there are two triangles where these sides are corresponding, then the triangles would be similar.

For example, suppose triangle IJX ~ triangle HJY. But need to verify the angles.

Alternatively, since the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, this could imply that line IH is parallel to line XY? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, using the converse of Thales' theorem, if a line cuts two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. But here, the ratio involves segments not directly on a triangle.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle XYZ and some other triangle. Wait, but I don't know much about triangle XYZ.

Alternatively, think of point J connected to X and Y. Wait, no. From the given lines, J is connected to G, H, I, L. Also, there's a line from J to X? No, the line W-X is given, but not directly J connected to X. Wait, angle WXJ is given. So angle at X between W and J. So point J is connected to X. Because angle WXJ is formed by lines WX and XJ. So yes, there's a line from X to J. So XJ is a line segment from X to J.

Similarly, angle WZG is at Z between W and G. So Z is connected to G. So line ZG.

So, points:

- D---W---X---Y---Z---C (all on line DC)

- J is connected to X (from angle WXJ), and possibly to other points.

Also, J is connected to G, H, I, L. So J is connected to G, H, I, L, and X (through the angle WXJ). Also, there's a triangle JGL? Wait, Triangle(J,G,H) and Triangle(J,I,L).

So, points G and H are connected to J and each other. Similarly, I and L are connected to J and each other.

Moreover, Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L). So GH || IL.

Now, given that GH || IL, then the corresponding angles formed by these lines with transversals would be equal. For example, if there's a transversal crossing GH and IL, the angles would be equal.

Also, the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me think of vectors or coordinate geometry. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate the angles?

Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to simplify the problem.

Assume line DC is horizontal for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s place point D at (0, 0). Then, since points W, X, Y, Z are on DC, which we can take as x-axis. Let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Let’s say D is at (0, 0). Let me choose coordinates such that:

- D is at (0, 0)
- W is at (a, 0)
- X is at (b, 0)
- Y is at (c, 0)
- Z is at (d, 0)
- C is at (e, 0), with a < b < c < d < e.

But without loss of generality, maybe assign specific coordinates for easier calculation. Let me pick specific values for simplicity. Let me assume DC is the x-axis, and let me assign coordinates:

Let me set D at (0, 0), C at (k, 0) for some k > 0. Then W, X, Y, Z lie between D and C.

To make things manageable, let me assume specific distances. Let me set D at (0,0), W at (1,0), X at (2,0), Y at (3,0), Z at (4,0), C at (5,0). So DC is from (0,0) to (5,0), with intermediate points W(1,0), X(2,0), Y(3,0), Z(4,0).

Now, point J is connected to X (as per angle WXJ). Also, there's an angle at X between W and J of 130 degrees. So from point X(2,0), line XJ makes an angle of 130 degrees with line WX (which is from X to W, i.e., towards left along x-axis). So angle between WX (direction from X to W is left) and XJ is 130 degrees. So direction of XJ is 130 degrees measured from the line WX (leftward). So if we consider standard position, the angle between negative x-axis (WX direction) and XJ is 130 degrees. So XJ would be going upwards from X(2,0), making 130 degrees with the negative x-axis. Therefore, the direction of XJ is 180 - 130 = 50 degrees above positive x-axis? Wait, let me think carefully.

At point X, the line WX goes from X to W, which is to the left (negative x-direction). The angle between WX and XJ is 130 degrees. So if we imagine standing at point X facing towards W (left), then turning 130 degrees towards J. Depending on whether it's clockwise or counterclockwise, but typically angles are measured counterclockwise unless specified otherwise. However, in geometry problems, sometimes angles are considered as the smaller one, but since it's given as 130°, which is obtuse, it's likely the actual angle.

So, if at point X, the line WX is pointing left (towards W), and the angle between WX and XJ is 130°, then XJ is going upward from X. To compute its slope, we can use trigonometry. The direction of XJ is 130° relative to the line WX (which is along negative x-axis). So if we consider the angle between the negative x-axis and XJ as 130°, then the direction of XJ is 130° from the negative x-axis. So the angle from the positive x-axis would be 180° - 130° = 50°, meaning that XJ is going up at 50° above the positive x-axis. Therefore, the slope of XJ is tan(50°). Let me calculate tan(50°): approximately 1.191753592.

Therefore, the coordinates of J can be determined if we assume some length. Let me assume XJ has length t. Then, the coordinates of J would be:

Starting at X(2,0), moving t units at 50° from positive x-axis. So delta_x = t*cos(50°), delta_y = t*sin(50°). Therefore, J's coordinates are (2 + t*cos(50°), 0 + t*sin(50°)).

But maybe instead of choosing t arbitrarily, we can relate it to other elements. However, this might get complicated. Perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, since there are parallel lines GH || IL, and triangles involving J, maybe using similar triangles.

Looking back at the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me denote that ratio as r. So IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → IJ * YJ = HJ * XJ. Which suggests that either these segments are corresponding sides in similar triangles or something similar.

Suppose we look at triangles IJY and HJX. If those were similar, then the ratio of sides would be consistent. But need to check angles.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, then maybe triangle JGH ~ triangle JIL? Let me check.

If GH || IL, then angle JGH equals angle JIL (corresponding angles), and angle JHG equals angle JLI (also corresponding angles). Therefore, triangles JGH and JIL would be similar by AA similarity. Hence, their sides are proportional. So JG/JI = JH/JL = GH/IL.

But how does that relate to our ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ?

Hmm. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, since GH || IL, then the ratio of lengths could involve segments on those lines.

Alternatively, consider that Line(GH) is parallel to Line(IL), so the distance between these lines might be constant, but not sure.

Alternatively, think of the given angles. Angle WZG is 20°, which is at point Z between W and G. Since Z is on DC, and G is connected to Z. So line ZG makes a 20° angle with line ZW (which is along DC towards W). So similar to earlier, the direction of ZG is 20° above the line ZW (which is towards W, i.e., leftwards). So direction of ZG is 20° above the negative x-axis. So similar to before, the angle from positive x-axis would be 180° - 20° = 160°, so slope of ZG is tan(160°) = tan(180° - 20°) = -tan(20°) ≈ -0.3640.

So if we assume some length for ZG, say s, then coordinates of G would be Z(4,0) plus s*cos(160°), s*sin(160°). Cos(160°) is cos(180°-20°) = -cos(20°) ≈ -0.9397, sin(160°)=sin(20°)≈0.3420. So G's coordinates would be (4 - s*cos(20°), 0 + s*sin(20°)).

Similarly, angle JLC is 20°, at point L between J and C. So line JL and LC form a 20° angle at L. Since C is on DC (the x-axis), line LC is from L to C (which is along x-axis towards C). So angle between JL and LC is 20°, meaning that JL is inclined at 20° above or below LC. Assuming same orientation as previous angles, it would be above. So direction of JL is such that from point L, line LC is towards C (right along x-axis), and angle between JL and LC is 20°, so JL is going upward from L at 20° above the x-axis. Thus, slope of JL is tan(20°) ≈ 0.3640.

Now, putting this together, maybe there are relations between points J, G, H, I, L.

But this seems getting too abstract. Let me think differently.

Since we have GH || IL, and the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, which is given. Also, there are angles given at various points. Maybe focusing on triangle YIZ, which is the angle we need to find.

Point Y is on DC at (3,0). Point I is connected to H and J (since Line(I,J) is present, and Triangle(J,I,L)). So I is connected to J and L. Also, Line(I,J) is present. So point I is connected to J and H (from Triangle(J,G,H) and Line(G,H))? Wait, Triangle(J,G,H) has points J, G, H. So H is connected to G and J. Also, Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L). So H is connected to G and J; I is connected to H and L.

Wait, Line(H,I) is present, so H is connected to I. Also, Line(I,J) is present, so I is connected to J. So I is connected to H and J, forming triangle JIH? Or triangle HIJ. Also, there's Triangle(J,I,L), so J, I, L form a triangle.

So points I, J, L are connected. Also, Line(I,J) and Line(J,L) are present.

So, point I is connected to H and J. Line(I,J) is part of triangle JIL. Also, since Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L), then maybe there's a parallelogram or something?

Alternatively, since GH || IL, and if we can establish that GIHL is a trapezoid, but not sure.

Back to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me consider triangles. Suppose we have two triangles where these sides are proportional. For example, if there's a triangle involving XJ and another involving YJ, with corresponding sides IJ and HJ.

Alternatively, consider triangle XJY and triangle HJI. If those are similar, then the ratio of sides would hold. But need to check angles.

Alternatively, since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, this suggests that line IH is parallel to line XY? Wait, why? Because if two triangles are similar with sides in proportion and included angles equal, then the lines would be parallel. But not sure.

Alternatively, applying the converse of Thales’ theorem: if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side. But here, the ratio involves IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. If we can consider a triangle where these segments are parts of the sides.

Wait, suppose there is a triangle with sides XJ and YJ, and another triangle with sides IJ and HJ. But not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle XJY and triangle HJI. If we have IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if the included angles are equal, then the triangles would be similar.

What is the included angle between XJ and YJ? At point J? No, XJ and YJ meet at J? No, XJ is from X to J, YJ is from Y to J. So they meet at J. So angle at J between XJ and YJ. Is that angle known?

Not directly. But maybe we can find it using other information.

Alternatively, since there are parallel lines, maybe we can find some angles.

Let me think about the angles given. At point X, angle WXJ is 130°, and at point Z, angle WZG is 20°. Also, angle JLC is 20°.

Maybe there's a way to connect these angles through the parallel lines.

Also, since GH || IL, then the angles made by transversal JL with GH and IL would be equal. For example, angle between GH and JL equals angle between IL and JL. Let me denote that.

Let me consider that GH || IL. So, for transversal JL, the corresponding angles are equal. So angle between GH and JL at H is equal to angle between IL and JL at L. Let me call these angles α. So angle GHJ equals angle ILL? Or something like that.

But without knowing specific points, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should try to find expressions for angles in terms of others.

Alternatively, consider triangle JGH and triangle JIL. Since GH || IL, and assuming some angles are equal, leading to similarity.

Let me try to find angles in triangle JGH and JIL.

In triangle JGH, angle at G is angle between JG and GH. In triangle JIL, angle at L is between JL and IL. Since GH || IL, those angles might be related.

But this is getting too vague. Let me return to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me express this as IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. This suggests that triangles IJH and XJY are similar if the included angles are equal. Let me check if that's possible.

If angle at J is common? No, because angle at J in triangle IJH is angle IJH, while in triangle XJY it's angle XJY. Are these angles equal?

Not sure. But if we can show that those angles are equal, then the triangles would be similar.

Alternatively, if the lines IH and XY are parallel, then the angles would be equal. But how to prove that?

Wait, if IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if angle IJH = angle XJY, then triangles IJH and XJY would be similar by SAS similarity. Then, the ratio of sides would be equal.

So assuming that angle IJH equals angle XJY, then triangles IJH ~ XJY, giving IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Hence, the equality holds. So this suggests that angle IJH equals angle XJY.

But how to find angle XJY? Let me think.

Angle XJY is the angle at point J between XJ and YJ. Wait, but we don't know that angle directly. However, maybe we can relate it to other angles.

Alternatively, since points X, Y, Z are on DC, and J is connected to X and possibly others. Let me consider the location of J. Earlier, I thought it was above DC. Assuming that, then line XJ goes from X(2,0) to J somewhere above. Similarly, line YJ goes from Y(3,0) to J.

If I can find the relationship between these lines, maybe through the angles.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around point J. But not sure.

Alternatively, since there are parallel lines, maybe some alternate interior angles.

Wait, earlier I considered that GH || IL. Let me think about that. Line GH is parallel to IL. If I can find a transversal that intersects both, like line JL. Then, angles formed by JL with GH and IL would be equal.

So, for example, angle between GH and JL at H equals angle between IL and JL at L. Let me denote these angles as β.

Now, if I can relate β to other angles in the diagram.

Also, angle JLC is 20°, which is at point L between J and C. So angle between JL and LC is 20°, as previously discussed. Since LC is along DC (x-axis), then angle between JL and x-axis is 20°, so JL makes a 20° angle with x-axis.

So, if angle between IL and JL is β, and angle between JL and x-axis is 20°, then depending on the position of IL, we might relate β to 20°.

But without more info, it's challenging. Let me try to combine everything.

Let me go back to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. If I assume that this ratio comes from similar triangles, then maybe triangles IJY and HJX are similar. Let me explore this.

If triangles IJY and HJX are similar, then:

IJ/YJ = HJ/XJ (given ratio), and angle at J would be common? Or some other angle.

Wait, if triangle IJY ~ triangle HJX, then corresponding angles would be equal. Let's say angle IJY corresponds to angle HJX. If that's the case, then angle at J in both triangles would be equal. But angle IJY is at point J between I and Y, while angle HJX is at point J between H and X. These are different angles unless lines IY and HX are parallel or something.

This seems too vague. Let me try to think of vector approaches.

Alternatively, since the problem involves finding angle YIZ, which is at point I between Y and Z. So, points Y(3,0), I, Z(4,0). Need to find angle at I between Y and Z.

If I can find coordinates of I, then I can compute this angle.

Earlier, I tried to assign coordinates to points, but it got complicated. Let me try again with specific values.

Let me fix coordinates:

Set D at (0,0), C at (5,0). Points W(1,0), X(2,0), Y(3,0), Z(4,0), C(5,0).

Now, find coordinates of J, G, H, I, L.

From angle WXJ = 130°, at point X(2,0). As discussed earlier, line XJ makes 130° with WX (which is left along x-axis). So direction of XJ is 50° above positive x-axis. Assume XJ has length t, so J's coordinates are (2 + t*cos(50°), 0 + t*sin(50°)).

Similarly, angle WZG = 20°, at point Z(4,0). Line ZG makes 20° with ZW (which is left along x-axis). So direction of ZG is 180° - 20° = 160° from positive x-axis. Assume ZG has length s, so G's coordinates are (4 + s*cos(160°), 0 + s*sin(160°)) = (4 - s*cos(20°), s*sin(20°)).

Also, angle JLC = 20°, at point L between J and C. So line JL makes 20° with LC (which is along x-axis towards C). So direction of JL is 20° above x-axis. Assume JL has length u, so L's coordinates are (J_x + u*cos(20°), J_y + u*sin(20°)).

Now, Line(G,H) || Line(I,L). So the slope of GH equals the slope of IL.

Let me try to define points H and I. 

From Triangle(J,G,H), which includes points J, G, H. So H is connected to G and J. Also, Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L). So once we define H, we can find I such that slope of GH equals slope of IL.

Also, Triangle(J,I,L) includes points J, I, L. So I is connected to J and L.

Let me attempt to define H. Since Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L), and we know G's coordinates, we can define H such that the slope of GH equals slope of IL. But without knowing I or L, this is tricky.

However, we also have the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me express this in terms of coordinates.

First, compute XJ: length from X(2,0) to J(x_j, y_j). So XJ = sqrt((x_j - 2)^2 + (y_j - 0)^2).

IJ: length from I(x_i, y_i) to J(x_j, y_j): sqrt((x_j - x_i)^2 + (y_j - y_i)^2).

HJ: length from H(x_h, y_h) to J(x_j, y_j): sqrt((x_j - x_h)^2 + (y_j - y_h)^2).

YJ: length from Y(3,0) to J(x_j, y_j): sqrt((x_j - 3)^2 + (y_j - 0)^2).

So the equation is sqrt((x_j - x_i)^2 + (y_j - y_i)^2) / sqrt((x_j - 2)^2 + y_j^2) = sqrt((x_j - x_h)^2 + (y_j - y_h)^2) / sqrt((x_j - 3)^2 + y_j^2).

This seems very complex, but maybe we can find relationships between points.

Also, since Line(G,H) || Line(I,L), their slopes are equal. Slope of GH = (y_h - y_g)/(x_h - x_g), slope of IL = (y_l - y_i)/(x_l - x_i).

But I don't know coordinates of H, I, L yet. This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps there's a better approach. Let me recall that in such problems, often the answer can be found using properties of parallel lines and triangle similarities, without needing full coordinate calculations.

Given that GH || IL, and the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, perhaps triangles JHI and JXY are similar?

Wait, if GH || IL, then angle between GH and JG is equal to angle between IL and JL (corresponding angles). So angle JGH = angle JLI. Also, angle JHG = angle JIL. So triangles JGH and JIL are similar. Hence, JG/JI = JH/JL = GH/IL.

But how does this relate to the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ?

Let me write down the similarity:

From triangles JGH ~ JIL, we have JG/JI = JH/JL. So JG/JH = JI/JL. Rearranged, JI/JG = JL/JH.

But I don't see a direct link to the given ratio. However, if we can relate JG and JH to other segments.

Alternatively, maybe combining this with other given information.

Also, given that angle WZG = 20°, which relates to point G. And angle JLC = 20°, relating to point L.

Maybe there's some symmetry or isosceles triangles.

Wait, angle WZG = 20° and angle JLC = 20°. Both are 20°, which might suggest some reflection or rotational symmetry.

Alternatively, since both angles are 20°, and they are at points Z and L, which are on DC. Maybe lines ZG and JC are symmetric in some way?

Alternatively, since GH || IL, and if I can find that some triangles are congruent or similar.

Alternatively, let's consider the sum of angles around point J. At point J, we have several angles: angle between JG and JH, angle between JH and JI, angle between JI and JL, and angle between JL and J... but not sure.

Alternatively, focus on the given angles and try to find relationships.

At point X, angle WXJ is 130°, so the supplement of this angle (at point X) is 50°, since 180 - 130 = 50. This might be useful.

At point Z, angle WZG is 20°, and at point L, angle JLC is 20°. These might be part of larger triangles or contribute to other angles.

Let me think about triangle XJY. If I can find some angles in it, maybe I can relate to other parts.

But without knowing more about the diagram, it's difficult. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- DC is a straight line with W, X, Y, Z on it.

- J is connected to X, and forms a 130° angle with WX.

- G is connected to Z, forming a 20° angle with WZ.

- L is connected to J, forming a 20° angle with JC.

- GH || IL.

- Ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

- Need to find angle YIZ.

Maybe the key lies in recognizing that due to the parallel lines and the given ratio, certain triangles are similar, allowing us to find angle relationships.

Let me revisit the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This suggests that the triangles formed by these segments are similar. If I assume that triangles IJY and HJX are similar, then:

∠IYJ = ∠HXJ (if corresponding angles).

But ∠IYJ is the angle at J between I and Y, and ∠HXJ is the angle at X between H and J. Not sure if these angles are equal.

Alternatively, if the lines IH and XY are parallel, then the corresponding angles would be equal. If IH || XY, then ∠IYJ = ∠XJY, which might lead to similar triangles.

But how to show that IH || XY?

If I can show that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ and that the included angles are equal, then by SAS similarity, triangles IJY and HJX would be similar, hence IH || XY.

Assuming that, then IH || XY, so angle between IH and IJ equals angle between XY and XJ.

But angle between XY and XJ is 130°, which is given. So angle between IH and IJ would also be 130°. But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, since IH || XY, then the angle at I between Y and H would be equal to the angle at X between Y and J. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since IH || XY, then the angle between IH and IY equals the angle between XY and YJ. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too speculative. Let me think about the possibility that angle YIZ is 50°, as a common angle in such problems. But need to justify it.

Wait, angle at X is 130°, which is supplementary to 50°. Maybe angle YIZ is related to this.

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, and if there's a triangle involving YIZ, perhaps using vertical angles or something.

Wait, let's consider the points Y, I, Z. Point Y is at (3,0), Z at (4,0). Point I is somewhere. If I can find the coordinates of I, I can compute the angle.

But earlier attempts to assign coordinates led to complexity. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that IH || XY, and use the given ratio.

Assume IH || XY. Then, since XY is along DC from X(2,0) to Y(3,0), it's a horizontal line. So if IH is parallel to XY, then IH is also horizontal. So line IH is horizontal.

If IH is horizontal, then point I and H are aligned horizontally. But H is connected to G and J. Let me think.

If IH is horizontal, then the y-coordinate of I and H are equal. Also, since Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L), and if IH is horizontal, then Line(I,L) has some slope.

But this is too vague. Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ suggests that J is the center of mass or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, since the ratio is equal, it suggests that J is the intersection point of two lines dividing segments proportionally, leading to parallel lines.

Wait, if IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, then by the converse of the basic proportionality theorem, line IH is parallel to line XY. Because if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, it is parallel to the third side. But here, it's not a triangle, but maybe if we consider a triangle where these segments are parts of the sides.

Imagine a triangle with base XY and a line IH parallel to it, cutting the sides proportionally. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Assuming IH || XY, then angle between IH and XI equals angle between XY and XI. But not helpful.

Alternatively, since IH || XY, then angle IYZ is equal to angle XYZ, but not sure.

Alternatively, since IH || XY, and XY is part of DC, which is a straight line, then IH is parallel to DC. So line IH is parallel to DC. If that's the case, then angle between IH and IJ would be equal to angle between DC and IJ.

But I don't know the direction of IJ.

Wait, if IH || DC, and I is on IH, then line IH is parallel to DC. So line IH is horizontal, as DC is horizontal. So if I is on IH, then I has the same y-coordinate as H. But this might help.

If I can find the y-coordinate of I, then I can find the slope of IJ and IZ to compute angle YIZ.

But without knowing coordinates, it's still challenging.

Let me try to proceed with the assumption that IH || XY (since the ratio suggests proportional division). If IH || XY, then the slope of IH is zero (horizontal), as XY is horizontal.

So, line IH is horizontal. So, point I and H have the same y-coordinate. Let me denote this y-coordinate as k.

Also, since Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L), and Line(I,L) has some slope. Let me denote the slope of Line(I,L) as m.

Since Line(G,H) is parallel to Line(I,L), they have the same slope m.

Now, let's consider point G. Earlier, we had G at (4 - s*cos(20°), s*sin(20°)), assuming ZG has length s. Let me denote G's coordinates as (gx, gy).

Point H is somewhere such that Line(G,H) has slope m, and H is connected to J.

Also, I is on Line(I,L), which has slope m, and I is connected to J.

But this is still too vague.

Perhaps I need to find a relationship between the angles. Let me think about the total angles around point J.

At point J, there are several lines: JG, JH, JI, JL. The angles between these lines depend on the configuration. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle JLC is 20°, maybe there's a way to add these or subtract.

Wait, if I consider triangle JYZ, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the fact that angle YIZ is the desired angle. Let me consider triangle YIZ. To find this angle, I need to know two sides or other angles in the triangle.

If I can find the measures of other angles in triangle YIZ, I can use the fact that the sum of angles is 180°.

But how?

Alternatively, since points Y and Z are on DC, and I is somewhere, maybe there's a way to relate angle YIZ to other angles.

Wait, if I can find the slope of IY and IZ, then I can find the angle between them.

Assuming I is at some point (xi, yi), then slope of IY is (yi - 0)/(xi - 3), and slope of IZ is (yi - 0)/(xi - 4). The angle between these two lines would be angle YIZ.

But without knowing xi and yi, it's impossible to calculate. But maybe there's a relationship between these slopes based on the given conditions.

Alternatively, since GH || IL, and if I can relate the slopes of GH and IL, which are equal.

But without knowing the exact positions, this is too abstract.

At this point, I might need to make an educated guess based on the given angles and the options provided.

The given angles are 130°, 20°, 20°. The options are 40, 50, 65, 110.

Since 130° is given, and 20° appears twice, maybe angle YIZ is 50°, which is 180° - 130°, or 130° - 20° - 20° = 90°, but none of these match the options except 50°.

Alternatively, since the ratio involves 20°, and angle WXJ is 130°, which is 180° - 50°, maybe the desired angle is 50°.

Alternatively, considering that the sum of angles around point J or other points might give this.

Given that I'm stuck, and the options include 50°, which is a common angle in such problems, I'll go with option B: 50°.
