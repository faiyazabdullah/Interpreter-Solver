====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of x given certain conditions involving points, lines, and a circle. Let me start by going through each predicate step by step.

First, the given points are A, B, C, D. There are lines connecting A-B, B-C, C-D, and A-D. Also, there's a circle D. Wait, the circle is named D? That might be confusing since D is also a point. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll assume Circle(D) refers to a circle centered at point D? Or maybe the circle has center D? Hmm, but then Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(D)) implies that line BC is tangent to the circle centered at D. 

Also, Point(B) lies on the circle D, so point B is on the circumference of the circle centered at D. Then, Point(D) lies on two lines: Line(A,D) and Line(C,D). So point D is the intersection of lines AD and CD. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(D,B,C), which means angle at point B between points D, B, and C is a right angle. 

Now, the lengths: LengthOf(Line(A,D)) equals x, same as LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 30, LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 18. Also, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) equals x, and LengthOf(Line(D,B)) equals x. So several segments have length x. 

Let me try to visualize this. Points A, B, C, D form some figure. Since line AD connects A and D, and line CD connects C and D, so D is connected to both A and C. Also, line BC is tangent to the circle centered at D. Wait, if the circle is centered at D, then radius would be the distance from D to any point on the circle. But point B is on the circle, so DB is a radius. Therefore, the radius of the circle is equal to DB. But DB is given as x. 

Since line BC is tangent to the circle at point B (since it's tangent and passes through B, which is on the circle), the radius DB should be perpendicular to the tangent line BC. So angle at B between DB and BC is a right angle. Wait, the problem states RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)), which is the angle at B between D, B, C. That aligns with the property that the radius is perpendicular to the tangent. So that checks out. 

So, triangle DBC is a right triangle with right angle at B. Wait, because angle at B is right. So triangle DBC has legs BD and BC, and hypotenuse DC. Wait, but DC is given as 18. Wait, but DC is the length from D to C, which is part of line CD. Wait, line CD connects C and D. So DC is 18. So in triangle DBC, BD is one leg (which is x), BC is another leg (given as 30), and hypotenuse DC is 18? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in a right triangle, the sum of squares of legs equals square of hypotenuse. Here, BD^2 + BC^2 = DC^2?

Wait, BD is x, BC is 30, DC is 18. So according to Pythagoras: x² + 30² = 18²? That would mean x² = 18² - 30² = (324 - 900) = negative number, which isn't possible. So something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption about which sides are legs and hypotenuse is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps DC is not the hypotenuse. Let me think again. The right angle is at B, so the sides adjacent to the right angle are BD and BC, and the hypotenuse is DC. Wait, but then DC should be longer than either BD or BC. However, DC is given as 18, while BC is 30. Which is longer? 30 is longer than 18. So that would imply that DC is the hypotenuse, but DC is shorter than BC. That's impossible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the triangle wrong. Let me re-examine the configuration. 

We have points D connected to A and C. So D is connected to A and C. Line BC is tangent to the circle centered at D. So line BC touches the circle at point B. Therefore, the radius DB is perpendicular to BC. Thus, triangle DBC is right-angled at B. So BD is perpendicular to BC. So BD is one leg, BC is another leg, and DC is hypotenuse. But DC is given as 18, BC is 30. Then BD (x) squared plus 30 squared equals 18 squared. Which gives x² = 18² - 30² = negative. Not possible. So that suggests inconsistency. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in identifying the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps DC is not the hypotenuse. Wait, if the right angle is at B, then the hypotenuse would be DC. But DC is 18, BC is 30, which is longer than DC. How can that be? Unless DC is not the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps the right angle is at a different vertex? No, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)), which is angle at B. So that's fixed. 

Hmm. This seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the points are arranged. Let me consider coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since angle at B is right angle, and BD is perpendicular to BC. Suppose BC is along the x-axis and BD is along the y-axis. So point B is at (0,0). Then point C would be at (30, 0) since BC is 30 units. Point D is somewhere such that BD is vertical (along y-axis), so D is at (0, k) where k is the length BD, which is x. 

But then DC is the distance from D (0,k) to C (30,0). The distance DC would be sqrt((30-0)^2 + (0 -k)^2) = sqrt(900 + k²). According to the given, DC is 18. So sqrt(900 + k²) = 18 → 900 + k² = 324 → k² = 324 - 900 = -576. Again, impossible. So this suggests that my coordinate setup is flawed. 

Wait, maybe DC is not the straight line from D to C? But the line CD is given, so DC is a straight line. Alternatively, perhaps the tangent line BC is not passing through B? But the predicate says Point(B) lies on the circle, and the line BC is tangent to the circle. So the tangent line at point B must be BC. Therefore, BC is tangent at B, hence BC is perpendicular to the radius DB. So that's the case. 

This leads us back to the previous contradiction. So why is there a contradiction here? Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. 

Given DC = 18, BC = 30, BD = x. In right triangle DBC, BD² + BC² = DC² → x² + 30² = 18² → x² = 324 - 900 = -576. Negative value. Impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the line BC is not the tangent at point B, but tangent elsewhere? But the predicate says Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(D)). So line BC is tangent to the circle D. Since point B is on the circle, then line BC is tangent at B. Therefore, the radius DB is perpendicular to BC. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, could the circle be tangent to line BC at another point besides B? But the predicate says Point(B) lies on the circle. So if line BC is tangent to the circle, then it touches at exactly one point. Since B is on the circle, the tangent line at B must be BC. Therefore, the radius DB is perpendicular to BC. 

So the problem seems inconsistent unless there's a different interpretation. Let me check other parts of the problem. 

Other given info: Lines AB, AD, BC, CD. So A is connected to B and D. C is connected to B and D. So points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral? With diagonals AD and BC? 

Additionally, Point(D) lies on Line(A,D) and Line(C,D). Well, that's trivial because D is on those lines. Also, Point(D) lies on Line(A,D) and Line(C,D), which just confirms that D is connected to A and C. 

Moreover, LengthOf(Line(A,D)) equals x, same as Line(A,B) and Line(D,B). So AB = AD = DB = x. So triangle ABD has AB = AD = x, and DB = x. So triangle ABD is equilateral? Wait, if AB = AD = DB, then yes, triangle ABD is equilateral, all sides equal. So all angles are 60 degrees. But earlier, we had angle at B being 90 degrees. Wait, that conflicts. 

Because angle at B in triangle ABD would be angle ABD. But angle DBC is 90 degrees. So maybe there's more to the diagram. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A and B connected, A and D connected, B and C connected, C and D connected. Also, D is connected to A and C. So points A, B, C, D with connections forming a quadrilateral ABCD? Or maybe a triangle with extra points? 

But considering the circle at D, tangent to line BC at B. And AB = AD = DB = x. 

So if AB = AD = DB, then triangle ABD is equilateral. So angle ABD is 60 degrees. But the problem states that angle DBC is 90 degrees. So angle between BD and BC is 90 degrees. Since angle ABD is 60 degrees, then angle ABC would be angle ABD + angle DBC = 60 + 90 = 150 degrees. 

But how does that relate to other elements? 

Wait, but in this scenario, BC is length 30, DC is 18. Let me try to find relations. 

From earlier, if triangle DBC has BD = x, BC = 30, and DC = 18, but that led to a contradiction. Unless... wait, maybe DC is not the side opposite the right angle. Wait, if the right angle is at B, then DC is the hypotenuse. But as before, that gives impossible lengths. 

Alternative possibility: Perhaps the line BC is tangent to the circle at a different point, not at B. But the predicate says Point(B) lies on the circle, so if line BC is tangent to the circle, it must touch at B. Otherwise, if it were tangent at another point, say E, then B would not lie on the circle. Therefore, line BC is tangent at B. 

Therefore, the earlier conclusion holds, leading to contradiction. So where is the mistake? 

Wait, maybe the circle is not centered at D? The predicate says Circle(D). Typically, in geometry problems, Circle(X) usually denotes a circle with center X. But maybe in this context, it's a circle passing through D? Or perhaps there's confusion in notation. 

Wait, the predicate says Point(D) lies on Line(A,D) and Line(C,D). So point D is on lines AD and CD. So D is the intersection of lines AD and CD. But if A is connected to D and C is connected to D, then D is a common point. 

But the circle is referred to as Circle(D). Assuming that Circle(D) is a circle with center D, then radius is the distance from D to any point on the circle. Since point B is on the circle, the radius is DB = x. 

Then, line BC is tangent to the circle at B, so as before, DB ⊥ BC. So triangle DBC is right-angled at B. 

But then DC² = DB² + BC² → 18² = x² + 30² → x² = 324 - 900 = -576. Not possible. 

So this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the length DC is not 18, but another value? Let me check the predicates again. 

The user said: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 18). Yes, DC is 18. BC is 30. So this seems correct. 

Wait, maybe the line BC is not tangent at B, but tangent elsewhere, and point B is not the point of tangency. But then, how can point B lie on the circle? If line BC is tangent to the circle, and point B is on the circle, then the tangent point must be B. Otherwise, if the tangent is at another point, then line BC would intersect the circle at B and the tangent point. But tangent line touches at one point, so if line BC is tangent to the circle and passes through B, which is on the circle, then it must be tangent at B. 

Thus, the earlier contradiction remains. 

Is there another way to interpret the predicates? For example, maybe the circle is not centered at D, but has D as a label? Like, maybe the circle is named D, but its center is another point. But the standard notation would be Circle(center, radius). Without knowing the center, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is defined by three points? Or maybe the circle is determined by other points. But the problem states Circle(D), so likely center is D. 

Wait, but what if D is not the center? For instance, if the circle is defined by point D lying on it. Wait, but the predicate says Point(D) lies on Line(A,D) and Line(C,D), which just defines D as a point on those lines. 

Wait, perhaps the circle is not centered at D, but has D as one of its points. So, for example, if the circle passes through D and has other points. But then, how do we know where the center is? 

But the predicate says Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(D)), which would require knowledge of the circle's center. If the circle is not centered at D, but contains D, then we need more info. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is defined by point D as its center, and the tangent condition gives us relations. 

But regardless, the earlier contradiction suggests that there's an issue. 

Perhaps I'm missing another relationship. Let me look at other given equalities. 

LengthOf(Line(A,D)) equals x, which is same as Line(A,B) and Line(D,B). So AB = AD = DB = x. So triangle ABD is equilateral, with all sides x. So angle at B is 60 degrees. But we also have angle DBC is 90 degrees. So angle between AB and BC is 60 + 90 = 150 degrees? 

But how does this affect the rest? 

Let me consider coordinates again. Let me set up coordinates where point B is at (0,0), as before. Since AB = x, and AD = x. Assume AB is along the x-axis. Let me suppose point A is at (-a, 0), so that AB is from A(-a,0) to B(0,0), making AB length a. Since AB = x, so a = x. Then, AD is also x. Since D is connected to A and B. Wait, but earlier, we thought D is connected to A and C. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try again. 

Since AB = AD = x, and D is a point such that AD = x. Let me assume point A is at (0,0), point B is at (x,0), since AB is x. Then, AD is also x. So point D lies somewhere at distance x from A. Also, since line AD connects A(0,0) to D. Let me choose D at (0,x), making AD vertical. Then, BD is the distance from B(x,0) to D(0,x), which is sqrt(x² + x²) = x√2. But according to the predicates, LengthOf(Line(D,B)) equals x. So x√2 = x → √2 = 1, which is false. Contradiction again. 

Hmm. So this suggests that assuming AB = AD = x and having D placed such that BD is also x is problematic. 

Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)), x). So DB = x. So in this setup, if AB = AD = x and DB = x, then triangle ABD has sides AB = AD = DB = x, making it equilateral. So angle at B is 60 degrees. But earlier, angle DBC is 90 degrees. So angle between DB and BC is 90 degrees. So if angle at B between DB and BC is 90 degrees, and angle between AB and DB is 60 degrees, then angle between AB and BC is 60 + 90 = 150 degrees. 

But how does this help us? Let me try to use coordinates again. 

Let me place point B at (0,0). Since angle at B between DB and BC is 90 degrees, let me take DB along y-axis and BC along x-axis. So point D is at (0, x), since DB = x. Point C is along x-axis at (c, 0), where c is the length BC. Given BC is 30, so c = 30. Thus, point C is at (30, 0). 

Now, DC is the distance from D(0,x) to C(30,0): sqrt((30-0)^2 + (0-x)^2) = sqrt(900 + x²). According to the predicate, DC = 18. So sqrt(900 + x²) = 18 → 900 + x² = 324 → x² = -576. Still impossible. 

So this suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's given data. But since it's a problem presented to solve, there must be a resolution. Perhaps I've misunderstood the configuration. 

Wait, maybe the line BC is not tangent at B, but tangent at another point, and point B is not the point of tangency. But then, how can point B lie on the circle? If line BC is tangent to the circle, and point B is on the circle, then it must be the point of tangency. Otherwise, if the tangent is at another point, say E, then line BE would be tangent, but BC would pass through B and E, implying that B is outside the circle, which contradicts point B being on the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is tangent to line BC at point B, but the radius is not DB. Wait, but the radius should be perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of contact. If the tangent is at B, then the radius is from the center of the circle to B. If the circle's center is not D, then DB is not necessarily the radius. 

Ah! This is a crucial point. Earlier, I assumed that Circle(D) is a circle centered at D, but maybe it's not. The predicate says Circle(D), but it could refer to a circle with name D, not necessarily centered at D. However, without more information, it's ambiguous. 

But if the circle is not centered at D, then we don't know where its center is. However, we do know that point B lies on the circle, and line BC is tangent to the circle. So the center of the circle lies along the perpendicular to BC at point B. 

Let me denote the center of the circle as O. Then, since line BC is tangent to the circle at B, the radius OB is perpendicular to BC. So vector OB is perpendicular to BC. 

So, if I can find the position of O, then I can use other information. 

But how? We also know that point D lies on line AD and line CD. Also, the length of DB is x, which is the same as AD, AB, etc. 

Let me attempt to define coordinates again. Let me place point B at (0,0), and since BC is tangent to the circle at B, and line BC is horizontal (for simplicity), let me set BC along x-axis. So point C is at (30,0), since BC = 30. The tangent line at B is BC, so the radius OB is vertical (perpendicular to BC). So the center O of the circle lies along the y-axis. Let me assume O is at (0, k), since it's along the perpendicular at B. 

Now, point D is such that it lies on lines AD and CD. Also, DB = x, and AD = x, AB = x. 

Let me consider AB = x. Since point A is connected to B, and AB = x. Let me place point A somewhere. If I assume that line AD is from A to D, and AD = x. Also, since D is on line CD, which connects C(30,0) to D. 

Additionally, point D is on line AD, which connects A to D. So D is somewhere on that line. Also, DB = x. 

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to express variables. 

Let me denote coordinates:

- B = (0, 0)
- C = (30, 0)
- O = (0, k) since it's along y-axis (radius OB is vertical)
- Circle has center O(0,k), radius r = |OB| = k (since B is on the circle, distance from O to B is k).

Now, line BC is tangent at B, so the circle equation is (x)^2 + (y - k)^2 = k² (since center is (0,k), radius k).

Now, point D lies on line CD and line AD. Let me find coordinates for D. 

But also, DB = x. So distance from D to B(0,0) is x. Also, AD = x. So distance from A to D is x. Additionally, AB = x. So distance from A to B is x. 

Let me assume point A is somewhere. Let me suppose that line AD goes from A to D, and AD = x. Let me parameterize point D. 

But I need more constraints. Also, D lies on line CD. Line CD connects C(30,0) to D. So parametric equations for line CD: starting at C(30,0) and going to D. Let me denote D as (d_x, d_y). Since D is on line CD, it satisfies the parametric form. But without knowing where D is, this is difficult. 

However, we also know that DB = x. So distance from D(d_x, d_y) to B(0,0) is sqrt(d_x² + d_y²) = x. 

Also, AD = x. So distance from A to D is x. Let me assume A is at some point (a_x, a_y), such that AB = x. Since AB is from A(a_x,a_y) to B(0,0), so sqrt(a_x² + a_y²) = x. 

But this introduces many variables. Let me see if there's another relation. 

Since D lies on line AD, which connects A and D. Wait, that's redundant. 

Also, line AD connects A and D, and D is on line CD. So D is the intersection of lines AD and CD. 

But without knowing A's location, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, since AD = x and AB = x, and AB is from A to B, which is length x. Let me assume point A is located such that AB = x and AD = x. So A is at distance x from B and from D. 

But D is also at distance x from B. So points A and D are both at distance x from B. So they lie on a circle centered at B with radius x. 

So, A and D are points on this circle. Also, line AD connects them. 

Now, line CD connects C(30,0) to D. Let me assume D is at some point (d_x, d_y) on the circle centered at B with radius x, so d_x² + d_y² = x². 

Also, line CD connects C(30,0) to D(d_x, d_y). The length DC is given as 18. So distance from D to C is sqrt((30 - d_x)^2 + (0 - d_y)^2) = 18. Squaring both sides: (30 - d_x)^2 + d_y² = 324. 

Expand this: 900 - 60d_x + d_x² + d_y² = 324. 

But since d_x² + d_y² = x², substitute:

900 - 60d_x + x² = 324 → x² - 60d_x = 324 - 900 = -576 → x² - 60d_x = -576 → 60d_x = x² + 576 → d_x = (x² + 576)/60. 

Now, also, since D lies on line AD. Let me find coordinates of A. Since AB = x and AD = x, and A is on the circle around B with radius x. Let me assume A is at some point (a_x, a_y) such that a_x² + a_y² = x². Also, since AD = x, the distance from A to D is x: sqrt((d_x - a_x)^2 + (d_y - a_y)^2) = x → (d_x - a_x)^2 + (d_y - a_y)^2 = x². 

But this introduces more variables. Perhaps there's another relation. 

Also, line AD connects A and D, so the line AD has direction from A to D. But without knowing A's position, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, since line AD is connected to point A and D, and D is on line CD, perhaps we can find relations via slopes or parametric equations. 

Alternatively, since we have the circle centered at O(0,k), and D is a point on the circle. Wait, no—the circle in question is the one tangent to BC at B, so its center is O(0,k), and point D is not necessarily on this circle. Wait, the predicate says Point(B) lies on the circle, but no mention of D being on it. 

Wait, the first predicate is Circle(D), which I initially thought was a circle centered at D, but if that's not the case, and instead, it's a circle named D (like a label), but with no specified center, it's unclear. This ambiguity might be the root of the problem. 

Assuming that Circle(D) is the circle tangent to BC at B, with center at O(0,k), and point B is on it. Now, what about point D? It is on lines AD and CD, and DB = x. 

But how does this connect to the circle? Maybe D is on the circle? The predicate says Point(B) lies on the circle, but not D. 

Unless there's another predicate I missed. Let me review:

Predicates given:

- Circle(D)
- Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D)
- Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(A,D)
- Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(D))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(B), Circle(D))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(D), Line(A,D))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(D), Line(C,D))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 30)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 18)
- RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)), x)

So, Point(D) lies on Line(A,D) and Line(C,D). So D is the intersection of lines AD and CD. 

Also, Point(B) lies on Circle(D). Wait, the circle is Circle(D), and Point(B) lies on it. So if Circle(D) is a circle with center D, then radius is DB = x. But this brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

But if Circle(D) is not centered at D, but has D as a label, then it's unclear. But since the problem includes the predicate Tangent(Line(B,C), Circle(D)), and Point(B) lies on Circle(D), it implies that the circle is tangent to line BC at B, and B is on the circle. Hence, the center of the circle lies on the perpendicular to BC at B. 

Let me try to combine this with the other info. 

Let me denote the center of the circle as O. Since it's tangent to BC at B, then OB is perpendicular to BC. As before, if BC is horizontal, then OB is vertical. Let me place B at (0,0), C at (30,0), so BC is along x-axis. Then, the center O is at (0, k) for some k. 

Now, since Point(B) lies on Circle(O), the radius is |OB| = |k|. 

Now, what about point D? It lies on lines AD and CD. Also, DB = x, and AD = x, AB = x. 

Let me consider that D is a point such that DB = x, and D is on line CD. Also, line CD has length 18. 

Let me write coordinates for D. Since D is on line CD, which connects C(30,0) to D. Let me parameterize D as follows: Let me say D is at (30 - t*(30 - d_x), 0 - t*d_y)? No, better to use parametric equations. 

Actually, since D is on line CD, and C is at (30,0), let me denote D as a point such that CD = 18. Let me assume D is somewhere along the line extending from C. 

But without knowing direction, it's tricky. Let me consider vector from C to D. Let me denote vector CD. Let me assume D is at some point such that CD = 18. 

But also, D is such that DB = x. 

Let me use the earlier equation from DC = 18. From earlier, we had:

For point D(d_x, d_y):

Distance from D to C(30,0) is 18: (d_x - 30)^2 + (d_y - 0)^2 = 1924? No, 18² is 324. So (d_x - 30)^2 + d_y² = 324.

Also, distance from D to B(0,0) is x: d_x² + d_y² = x².

Subtracting these two equations:

[(d_x - 30)^2 + d_y²] - [d_x² + d_y²] = 324 - x²

Expanding (d_x - 30)^2 - d_x² = 324 - x²

Which becomes: d_x² - 60d_x + 900 - d_x² = 324 - x² → -60d_x + 900 = 324 - x² → -60d_x = 324 - x² - 900 → -60d_x = -576 - x² → 60d_x = 576 + x² → d_x = (x² + 576)/60.

Now, from the second equation, d_x² + d_y² = x². Let me express d_y² = x² - d_x². 

But we also know that point D lies on line AD, which connects A and D. Since AD = x and AB = x, let me find coordinates of A. 

Let me assume that A is at some point (a_x, a_y) such that AB = x, so sqrt(a_x² + a_y²) = x. Also, AD = x, so sqrt((d_x - a_x)^2 + (d_y - a_y)^2) = x → (d_x - a_x)^2 + (d_y - a_y)^2 = x². 

But this is getting too abstract. Let me see if there's another relation. 

Since line AD connects A and D, and D is on line CD. Also, line AD has length x. Let me consider that A is such that AB = x and AD = x. So A is at distance x from B and from D. So A lies at the intersection of two circles: one centered at B with radius x, and one centered at D with radius x. 

The intersection points of these two circles would give possible locations for A. 

The distance between B and D is x, so the two circles (centered at B and D, both radius x) intersect at two points forming an equilateral triangle ABD. So angle at B is 60 degrees. 

But we also have angle DBC is 90 degrees. So angle between BD and BC is 90 degrees. 

Let me consider triangle DBC, where BD = x, BC = 30, and DC = 18. Earlier, we saw that this leads to a contradiction. But if we use the coordinates from above, where d_x = (x² + 576)/60, and d_y² = x² - d_x², then perhaps we can find x by using other constraints. 

Also, since point D is on line AD, which connects A and D. Let me assume A is one of the intersection points of the two circles. Let me pick one of the intersection points. 

Let me assume A is located such that triangle ABD is equilateral. So, if B is at (0,0), and D is at (d_x, d_y), then A is at a rotation of D around B by 60 degrees. 

But this might be complex. Alternatively, since AB = AD = x, and BD = x, then triangle ABD is equilateral, so angle at B is 60 degrees. But we also have angle DBC is 90 degrees, so the total angle at B between AB and BC is 60 + 90 = 150 degrees. 

Now, in triangle DBC, we have BD = x, BC = 30, DC = 18. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle DBC: DC² = BD² + BC² - 2*BD*BC*cos(angle at B). 

Wait, angle at B is 90 degrees? No, the angle at B is between DB and BC, which is 90 degrees. So in triangle DBC, angle at B is 90 degrees. So DC² = BD² + BC². 

Wait, this is the Pythagorean theorem. So DC² = x² + 30² → 18² = x² + 30² → x² = 18² - 30² = -576. Again, impossible. 

This suggests that under the assumption that angle at B is 90 degrees, there's no solution. Hence, there must be a different interpretation. 

Maybe the angle is not at B, but somewhere else? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)), which is angle at B. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not between DB and BC, but between CB and BD? No, angle DBC is at B, between D, B, C. So it's still the same. 

At this point, I'm stuck. All paths lead to a contradiction, suggesting either a mistake in the problem or a misinterpretation. 

Let me revisit the original predicates. One of the equals is Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), x), and Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)), x). So AD = DB = x. Also, AB = x. So triangle ABD has AB = AD = DB = x, making it equilateral. Hence, angle at B is 60 degrees. But the problem states that angle at B is 90 degrees. This is conflicting. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent, but since it's a problem to solve, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the angle is not part of triangle DBC but another triangle? 

Wait, the right angle is at B between D, B, C. So it's angle DBC. But in triangle DBC, if DB = x, BC = 30, and DC = 18, then it's impossible. 

But maybe DC is not the hypotenuse? What if the right angle is at a different vertex? No, the predicate specifies it's at B. 

Wait, perhaps the right angle is at D? No, the predicate says Angle(D,B,C), which is at B. 

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to consider that maybe the length DC is not 18, but something else. Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 18). So DC = 18. 

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different theorem. For example, power of a point. Since line BC is tangent to the circle at B, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CB² = CD * CE, where CE is the length from C to the second intersection point. But since BC is tangent, CE is zero? No, power of point C would be CB² = CD * CF, where F is the other intersection. But since BC is tangent, it touches at B, so CF = CB, and the power is CB² = CD * CB, implying CB = CD. But CB is 30, CD is 18, so 30 = 18, which is false. 

This suggests that the power of point C with respect to the circle is CB² = CD * CF, but since BC is tangent, it should be CB² = CD * CF, where CF is the length from C to the second intersection. But since it's tangent, CF = 0, which would imply CB² = 0, which is not true. Hence, contradiction again. 

This indicates that there's an inconsistency in the problem's given data. However, since it's a multiple-choice question, and one of the options is 30, 18, 16, or 34, perhaps I should re-express the earlier equation where DC² = x² + 30², even though it gives x² = -576, and see if there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, if I assume that DC is not the hypotenuse, but another side, perhaps using cosine law with angle at B being 90 degrees. Wait, if angle at B is 90 degrees, then DC² = x² + 30². But DC is 18, so 18² = x² + 30² → x² = 324 - 900 = -576. No. 

Alternatively, if the angle at B is not 90 degrees, but something else. But the problem states it is. 

Wait, maybe the length DC is not 18, but 34? If DC = 34, then x² = 34² - 30² = 1156 - 900 = 256 → x = 16. Which is option A. 

But the given DC is 18, not 34. So this suggests that if there was a typo and DC was meant to be 34, then x would be 16. But since the problem states DC is 18, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given DC is 18, and the correct calculation is x = 24, but none of the options include 24. 

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the right angle is at D, not B. If the angle at D is 90 degrees, then in triangle DBC, angle at D is 90 degrees. Then, DC² = DB² + BC² → 18² = x² + 30² → x² = 324 - 900 = -576. Still no. 

If the right angle is at C, then DB² = DC² + BC² → x² = 18² + 30² → x = sqrt(324 + 900) = sqrt(1224) ≈ 34.97, close to 34. Option D is 34. 

But the problem states the right angle is at B. So this is speculative. 

But if the problem has a typo and the right angle is at C, then x would be approximately 34, matching option D. 

Given the options, and the lack of other possibilities, perhaps the intended answer is D. 34. 

But this is purely speculative. However, given the options, and the fact that if DC were 34, x would be 16 (option A), but if the right angle is at C, x is 34 (option D). 

Alternatively, maybe the length DC is 30, and BC is 18, giving x = sqrt(30² - 18²) = 24, but not an option. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at D, and DC is 30, BC is 18, then x = sqrt(30² - 18²) = 24. 

But given the options, and the presence of 34, which is close to sqrt(34² - 30²) = sqrt(196) = 14, no. Wait, if DC is 34, BC is 30, then x = sqrt(34² - 30²) = sqrt(196) = 14, not in options. 

Wait, perhaps the problem involves using the power of a point. Let me try that. 

Since line BC is tangent to the circle at B, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CB² = CD * CE, where CE is the length from C to the second intersection. But since BC is tangent, it touches at B, so CE = CB, and the power is CB² = CD * CB → CB = CD, but CB is 30, CD is 18, so 30 = 18, which is false. 

This suggests that there's no such circle, but since the problem exists, perhaps the circle is not tangent at B, but at another point. But then, how does point B lie on the circle? 

If the circle passes through B and is tangent to line BC at another point E, then the power of point C would be CE² = CB * CF, where F is the other intersection. But without knowing E or F, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, if the circle passes through B and is tangent to BC at B, then the power of point C is CB² = CD * CE, but since it's tangent, CE = CB, so CD * CB = CB² → CD = CB, which is 30 = 18, which is false. 

This again shows inconsistency. 

Given all this, and since the closest plausible answer is option D (34) if there's a miscalculation, I'll go with D.
