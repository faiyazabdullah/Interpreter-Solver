MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram ABCD with certain side lengths given in terms of variables x, y, w. The perimeter is 22, and we need to find AB. 

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. That means AB equals CD, and BC equals DA. Let me check the given predicates to confirm. Yes, there's an Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(C,D))) and similarly for BC and DA. So that's consistent with a parallelogram.

Now, looking at the given equations. The lengths are expressed in terms of variables. Let me list them out:

AB = 2y + 1
BC = x - w + 1
CD = 3 - 4w
DA = 3x - 2

But since it's a parallelogram, AB = CD and BC = DA. So setting up those equations:

From AB = CD: 2y + 1 = 3 - 4w → equation (1)
From BC = DA: x - w + 1 = 3x - 2 → equation (2)

Also, there's another equality given: SumOf(Mul(2, AB), Mul(2, BC)) = 22. Wait, that's 2*AB + 2*BC = 22? Let me parse that correctly. The predicate says SumOf(Mul(2, LengthOf(Line(A,B))), Mul(2, LengthOf(Line(B,C)))) equals 22. So yes, 2*(AB) + 2*(BC) = 22. Which simplifies to 2AB + 2BC = 22. Dividing both sides by 2 gives AB + BC = 11. So AB + BC = 11. But since AB and BC are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, their sum relates to half the perimeter? Wait, the perimeter of a parallelogram is 2*(AB + BC). Since the perimeter is given as 22, then 2*(AB + BC) = 22, so AB + BC = 11. Which matches the other equation. So that checks out. So that equation is redundant but confirms consistency.

So our main equations are:

Equation (1): 2y + 1 = 3 - 4w → rearranged as 2y + 4w = 2 → divide by 2: y + 2w = 1 → equation (1a)

Equation (2): x - w + 1 = 3x - 2 → let's solve for x and w. Subtract x from both sides: -w + 1 = 2x - 2 → Rearranged: -w = 2x - 3 → w = -2x + 3 → equation (2a)

Additionally, we have expressions for AB and BC in terms of variables. But we need more relations to solve for these variables. However, perhaps we can express everything in terms of one variable?

Wait, but maybe there's another equation. Let me think. We have AB = 2y + 1 and BC = x - w + 1. Also, from equation (1a), y = 1 - 2w. So substituting that into AB gives AB = 2*(1 - 2w) + 1 = 2 - 4w + 1 = 3 - 4w. Wait, but CD is given as 3 - 4w, which equals AB. So that's consistent. So AB = CD = 3 - 4w. And BC = x - w + 1, and DA = 3x - 2, which equals BC. So we have BC = x - w + 1 = 3x - 2. Which was equation (2).

So equation (2a) is w = -2x + 3. Now, maybe we can substitute w into AB or BC expressions?

Let me see. Let's try to express AB and BC in terms of x. Since AB = 3 - 4w, and w = -2x + 3. Substituting:

AB = 3 - 4*(-2x + 3) = 3 +8x -12 = 8x -9.

Similarly, BC = x - w + 1. Substitute w:

BC = x - (-2x +3) +1 = x +2x -3 +1 = 3x -2. Wait, but BC is also equal to DA, which is 3x -2. So that's consistent. Therefore, BC = 3x -2.

But earlier, we had AB + BC = 11. So substituting AB and BC:

(8x -9) + (3x -2) = 11 → 11x -11 = 11 → 11x = 22 → x=2.

Then, once we know x=2, we can find w from equation (2a):

w = -2*(2) +3 = -4 +3 = -1.

Now, with x=2 and w=-1, we can compute AB. Recall AB = 8x -9. Plugging in x=2:

AB = 8*2 -9 = 16 -9 = 7. Alternatively, since AB = 3 -4w, with w=-1:

AB = 3 -4*(-1) = 3 +4 = 7. Either way, AB is 7.

Therefore, the answer should be A. Let me verify if this makes sense. Let's check all the values.

With x=2, w=-1:

AB = 2y +1. From equation (1a): y +2w =1 → y +2*(-1)=1 → y=1+2=3. Then AB = 2*3 +1 =7. Correct.

BC = x -w +1 = 2 -(-1)+1 = 2+1+1=4. Check DA =3x-2=3*2-2=6-2=4. So BC=DA=4. Then perimeter is 2*(AB + BC)=2*(7+4)=2*11=22. Which matches. All conditions are satisfied. So AB=7, which is option A.
