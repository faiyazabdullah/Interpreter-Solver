MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D all lying on a circle with center O. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral. Also, there are some angles mentioned: angle AOB is 120 degrees, and angle ACB is half of that, so 60 degrees. The question asks for angle 9, but I need to check if that refers to a specific angle in the diagram. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps angle at point O? Let me think.

First, let me parse the given information. Points A, B, C, D are on the circle centered at O. So OA, OB, OC, OD are radii of the circle. Then, lines AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral ABCD. But since they're all on the circle, it's a cyclic quadrilateral. 

Now, the angles given: Angle AOB is 120 degrees. Since O is the center, angle AOB is a central angle subtended by arc AB. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, arc AB measures 120 degrees. 

Then, angle ACB is given as half of angle AOB, which would be 60 degrees. Wait, angle ACB is an inscribed angle. Inscribed angles are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. So angle ACB intercepts arc AB. Wait, but if angle ACB is formed by points A, C, B, then the intercepted arc would be arc AB. But angle ACB is an inscribed angle, so its measure should be half the measure of arc AB. However, arc AB is 120 degrees, so angle ACB should be 60 degrees. That matches the given information. 

So that checks out. Now, the question is about angle 9. Hmm, maybe it's referring to another angle in the diagram. Let me visualize the quadrilateral ABCD. Since ABCD is cyclic, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But wait, we know angle ACB is 60 degrees. Maybe angle at point O?

Wait, let me consider the full diagram. We have points A, B, C, D on the circle. Lines AB, BC, CD, DA. So ABCD is a quadrilateral. Let me think about the angles at the center O. For example, angle AOB is 120 degrees. What about other central angles?

Since the total circumference is 360 degrees, the sum of all central angles around O should be 360. So if arc AB is 120 degrees, then the remaining arcs BC, CD, DA add up to 240 degrees. But without more info, maybe we need to find relations between these arcs.

Alternatively, considering triangle ACB. In triangle ACB, angle at C is 60 degrees. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angles formed by intersecting chords have certain properties. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that angle ACB is 60 degrees and relate it to other angles.

But the question mentions angle 9. Maybe angle 9 refers to angle AOD? Or another angle? Wait, the original problem says "Find ∠9." Perhaps it's a mislabeling, like angle at O? Or maybe angle BAD? Wait, maybe there's a diagram missing here. Since I don't have the diagram, I need to infer based on the given information.

Let me try again. Given that angle AOB is 120 degrees. Let me think about the arcs. Arc AB is 120 degrees. Then angle ACB is 60 degrees, which intercepts arc AB. Now, if I look at triangle ACB, with angle at C being 60 degrees. Let me also note that since ABCD is cyclic, angle ABC and angle ADC are supplementary. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle AOB. It's an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii. So OA = OB. Therefore, triangle AOB has two sides equal, making base angles at A and B equal. Wait, angle at O is 120 degrees, so the sum of angles at A and B is 60 degrees each. Therefore, each base angle is 30 degrees. Wait, angle OAB and angle OBA are each 30 degrees. 

But how does this help us? Let me see. If I consider point C. Since ABCD is cyclic, maybe there are some relations. Also, angle ACB is 60 degrees. Let me think about triangle ACB. If I can find other angles in that triangle, maybe I can find something.

Wait, angle ACB is 60 degrees, and angle OAB is 30 degrees. Is there a relation between those? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle OAC or OBC? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But ABCD's angles are at points A, B, C, D. But we only have one angle given. Wait, angle at C (angle ACB) is part of triangle ACB. Maybe I need to find another angle.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to angle AOD? Let me think. If arc AB is 120 degrees, then what about arc AD? Well, unless we know more about the arcs, we can't say. But maybe there's symmetry. For instance, if the quadrilateral is symmetric, but we don't know that.

Alternatively, since angle ACB is 60 degrees, which is half of angle AOB (which is 120 degrees). So that suggests that maybe angle ACB relates to arc AB. Now, if we consider point C somewhere on the circle. Let me think about the position of point C. Since angle ACB intercepts arc AB, then point C lies on the circumference such that when you connect A-C-B, the angle at C is half the arc AB. Which we already knew.

But how do we get angle 9? Maybe angle AOD? Let me think. Suppose angle AOD is the central angle corresponding to arc AD. If I can find the measure of arc AD, then angle AOD would be equal to that. To find arc AD, we need to know the other arcs. Since arc AB is 120 degrees, and the rest of the circle is 240 degrees. But without knowing where C and D are, it's hard to tell. Unless there's more constraints.

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between arcs BC and CD. Let me think. Since ABCD is cyclic, the order of the points matters. The lines AB, BC, CD, DA imply that the quadrilateral is connected in order. So the points are arranged in the order A, B, C, D around the circle. Therefore, arcs AB, BC, CD, DA make up the entire circle. So arc AB is 120 degrees, and the other three arcs (BC, CD, DA) add up to 240 degrees. 

Now, angle ACB is 60 degrees. As an inscribed angle over arc AB, which we already considered. Now, maybe there's another angle that's related. Let me think about angle at point D. Or angle at point O. Alternatively, maybe angle at O for arc AD?

Wait, suppose we want to find angle AOD. That would correspond to arc AD. To find arc AD, we need to know the measures of arcs AB + BC + CD? No, arc AD is the arc from A to D going the other way. Wait, depending on the direction. Since the points are ordered A, B, C, D around the circle, arc AD could be either the minor arc or major arc. But in a cyclic quadrilateral, the order implies that the arcs between consecutive points are the ones we've been talking about.

Alternatively, maybe angle at O between points A and D. If we can find the measure of arc AD, then angle AOD equals that. How can we find arc AD? Let's think. Since we know arc AB is 120 degrees. What about arc BC? Let me see. 

In triangle ACB, angle at C is 60 degrees. Let me think about the arcs intercepted by other angles. For example, angle at B, angle ABC. Wait, angle ABC is part of the quadrilateral. Since ABCD is cyclic, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180 degrees. But we don't know angle ADC. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another inscribed angle. Let's think about angle ABD. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB is 60 degrees, which intercepts arc AB. Then, what about angle ADB? Because angle ADB would intercept arc AB as well. Wait, angle ADB would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB. So angle ADB would be equal to angle ACB, which is 60 degrees. So angle ADB is 60 degrees. 

But how does that help us? Let me consider triangle ABD. If angle at D is 60 degrees, and we have other angles... Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AOD. If we can find arc AD, then angle AOD would be equal to that. Let me see. If I can find arc AD, then angle AOD is that measure. 

To find arc AD, since the total circle is 360 degrees. Arc AB is 120 degrees. Then, arcs BC, CD, DA sum to 240 degrees. But we need more information. 

Wait, maybe there's another angle given. Let me check the problem again. The given angles are angle AOB = 120°, and angle ACB = 60°, which is half of angle AOB. Are there any other angles mentioned? No. So maybe we need to use the fact that ABCD is cyclic and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Another thought: Since ABCD is cyclic, the sum of angles at B and D is 180 degrees. Wait, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180°. But I don't know angle ABC or angle ADC. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB is 60°, and ABCD is cyclic, maybe there's a way to find other angles. For instance, angle ACD or angle CBD. 

Alternatively, let's think about the triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at C is 60°, and angle at B. Wait, angle at B in triangle ABC is angle ABC. But angle ABC is part of the quadrilateral. 

Wait, earlier, we found that in triangle AOB, angles at A and B are each 30°, so angle OAB = 30°, angle OBA = 30°. Now, angle OAB is part of angle CAB. Because point O is the center. So angle CAB is composed of angle OAB and angle OAC? Not sure. Wait, point O is the center, so OA and OB are radii. If I draw line OC, then maybe we can find some relations. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, and angle ACB = 60°, which intercepts arc AB. Then, maybe the arc AB is 120°, so the arc AB is twice that angle. Now, if I can find other arcs. For example, arc BC. Let me think about angle at point B. 

Wait, angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC. Because in a cyclic quadrilateral, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc ADC. Similarly, angle ADC intercepts arc ABC. 

But without knowing arc ADC or arc ABC, it's difficult. However, since arc AB is 120°, and assuming that the arcs BC, CD, DA sum to 240°, maybe there's a way to express them in terms of other variables. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB = 60°, which intercepts arc AB = 120°, then maybe there's another angle that intercepts another arc. For instance, angle ADB intercepts arc AB as well, so it's 60°, as before. 

But how does that help us? Maybe considering triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, angle at D is 60°, and if we can find other angles or sides. 

Alternatively, maybe focusing on triangle AOD. If we can find the measure of arc AD, then angle AOD is equal to that. But how?

Wait, let's consider that the sum of all arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360°. We know AB is 120°, so BC + CD + DA = 240°. But without more information, we can't determine individual arcs. 

However, maybe there's a relation due to the angles in the triangle. Let me think again about triangle ACB. In triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, and if I can find other angles in that triangle. 

We know angle ACB = 60°, but we need more information about the other angles. For example, angle at A or angle at B. 

Wait, angle at A in triangle ACB is angle CAB. Earlier, we had in triangle AOB, angle OAB = 30°, which is part of angle CAB. If we can find the measure of angle CAB, then we can find angle at A in triangle ACB. 

But how? Let's think. Point O is the center. So OA is a radius. Line AB connects A to B. The angle between OA and AB is angle OAB, which we said was 30°. So angle CAB is equal to angle OAB plus angle OAC? Wait, no. If we consider point C, which is somewhere on the circle. So angle CAB is part of triangle ACB. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find angle CAB. Let me consider triangle AOC. If I can find angle AOC, then maybe I can find some relations. 

But angle AOC is a central angle subtending arc AC. The measure of arc AC would depend on arcs AB and BC. Since arc AB is 120°, and arc BC is x, then arc AC would be 120 + x. Thus, angle AOC would be 120 + x degrees. 

But without knowing x, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but maybe there's another angle that relates to arc BC. Let me think about angle at B. 

In triangle ACB, angle at B is angle ABC. Which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc ADC. Arc ADC includes arc DC, arc CB, and arc BA? Wait, no. Arc ADC is from A to C passing through D. Wait, since ABCD is cyclic, arc ADC would be arc AD + arc DC. 

But without knowing arc AD or arc DC, this seems stuck. 

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me go back. 

Given that angle AOB = 120°, and angle ACB = 60°, which is half of angle AOB. So angle ACB is an inscribed angle over arc AB. Now, what if we look at triangle ACD? Or triangle AOD? 

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, and angle ACB = 60°, which is the same as angle ADB (since they both intercept arc AB). So angle ADB = 60°. 

Now, in triangle ABD, we have angle at D is 60°, and we might be able to find other angles if we know more. 

But how? Let's consider that angle ABD is part of the quadrilateral. 

Alternatively, since we know arc AB is 120°, and if we can find arc AD, then angle AOD is equal to arc AD. Let me assume that arc AD is x degrees. Then, angle AOD is x degrees. 

Also, the sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360°. We know AB is 120°, so BC + CD + DA = 240°. 

But we need more equations. Let me think. 

What if we consider angle at point B? In triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC. As mentioned before, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC. Measure of angle ABC = ½(arc ADC). Arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC. 

Similarly, angle at D in triangle ADC would intercept arc AC. 

This seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, let's think about the fact that angle ACB = 60°, and angle AOB = 120°, which is double. So maybe there's a relationship between triangle ACB and triangle AOB. 

For example, if we consider drawing line OC. Then, maybe triangle ACB and triangle AOB share some properties. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, and angle ACB = 60°, which is half the central angle over arc AB. Maybe there's a way to find other central angles. 

Wait, if we consider point C, which forms angle ACB. Since ABCD is cyclic, point C is located such that when you connect A-C-B, the angle at C is 60°. 

Maybe if we construct triangle AOB and triangle COB. 

Alternatively, since angle AOB is 120°, and angle ACB is 60°, which is half of that. Maybe there's a relationship between OC and the other points. 

Wait, if I consider triangle ACB and triangle AOB. In triangle AOB, OA=OB=R (radius), and angle at O is 120°, making it an isosceles triangle with base angles 30° each. 

Now, in triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, and if we can find other angles. Let me try to calculate angles in triangle ACB. 

In triangle ACB, we know angle at C is 60°, and we need to find other angles. If I can find side lengths or other angles. 

But without knowing any sides or other angles, it's tricky. However, maybe there's a relationship between triangle ACB and the radii. 

Wait, if we extend OC to meet the circle at another point, but I don't know where. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is cyclic, and points A, B, C, D lie on the circle. So, if I can find the measure of arc BC, then I can find angle BOC, which would be the central angle over arc BC. 

But again, without knowing arc BC, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but angle ACB is 60°, which intercepts arc AB. So, arc AB is 120°, as previously determined. Now, if we can find arc BC, then maybe we can find arc BD or something else. 

Alternatively, consider triangle OBC. If we can find angle BOC, then we can find arc BC. 

But how? Let me think. If I can relate angle BOC to other angles. 

Wait, in triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, and if we can relate that to angles involving O. 

Alternatively, since OA and OB are radii, and OC is a radius as well. So, OC = R. 

Maybe triangle OBC is isosceles if arc BC is equal to arc AB, but we don't know that. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me try to take a different route. 

Assume that the question is asking for angle AOD, which is the central angle over arc AD. If I can find arc AD, then angle AOD is equal to that. 

From earlier, arc AB is 120°, so the remaining arcs BC + CD + DA = 240°. 

Now, let's consider triangle ACB again. Angle at C is 60°, and angle ACB intercepts arc AB. Now, if I can find arc BC, then arc CD and DA can be found in terms of other arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I missed. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But that's Ptolemy's theorem. 

But I don't have side lengths, so maybe that's not helpful. 

Wait, but Ptolemy's theorem states that for cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, AC * BD = AB * CD + BC * DA. But again, without knowing any side lengths, it's not helpful. 

Another idea: Since angle ACB = 60°, which is an inscribed angle over arc AB, and angle AOB = 120°, which is the central angle over the same arc. Now, if I consider point C, which is not on the arc AB, but somewhere else. 

If I can find the position of point C, maybe relative to arc AB. For example, if arc AB is 120°, then point C is located such that when you connect A-C-B, angle at C is 60°. 

But how does that determine where C is on the circle? 

It depends on the location of C. For example, if C is on the arc opposite to AB, then angle ACB would be half the difference of the arcs. Wait, no. Inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, if point C is on the circumference, then angle ACB intercepts arc AB, regardless of where C is, as long as it's not on the arc AB. 

Wait, no. If point C is on the arc AB that doesn't contain the other points, then angle ACB would be half the measure of arc AB. But if point C is on the opposite arc, then angle ACB would be half the measure of the arc that's opposite. 

Wait, in this case, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, point C must be positioned such that when you connect the points in order A, B, C, D, the arc AB is 120°, and point C is after B. So, arc BC is some length, then arc CD, then arc DA. 

Therefore, point C is on the arc from B to D, not overlapping with AB. So, angle ACB intercepts arc AB, which is 120°, hence angle ACB = 60°, which matches. 

Now, if I consider the position of point D. Since the quadrilateral is closed, arc DA completes the circle. 

But still, without more information, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe there's a symmetry. Suppose that arc BC is equal to arc CD. But why would that be? 

Alternatively, maybe angle AOD is equal to 120°, but that's just guessing. 

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose I consider the full circle. Arc AB is 120°, so the rest is 240°. If I assume that arc BC is equal to arc CD, then arc BC = arc CD = 120°, making arc DA = 0°, which isn't possible. So that assumption is invalid. 

Alternatively, if arc BC is 60°, then arc CD + DA = 180°. Still, no clue. 

Another approach: Let's consider the triangle AOD. If I can find the measure of arc AD, then angle AOD is equal to that. How can I find arc AD? 

Arc AD is equal to arc AB + arc BC + arc CD - arc AB? No. Wait, arc AD is from A to D along the circumference. Depending on the direction, it could be the shorter or longer arc. 

Since the points are in order A, B, C, D around the circle, arc AD goes from A to D passing through B and C, or the other way around. But since arc AB is 120°, and the rest adds up to 240°, the arc AD passing through B and C would be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD = 120 + arc BC + arc CD. But arc BC + arc CD = 240 - arc DA. Wait, this seems circular. 

Wait, let me define variables. Let arc AB = 120°, arc BC = x, arc CD = y, arc DA = z. So x + y + z = 240°. 

Now, what else can we derive? 

In triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, which is an inscribed angle over arc AB. So that gives us nothing new. 

But maybe there's another inscribed angle. For example, angle at D, angle ADC, which would be an inscribed angle over arc AB. Wait, no. Angle ADC intercepts arc ABC. 

Wait, angle ADC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ABC. The measure of angle ADC is ½(arc ABC). Arc ABC is arc AB + arc BC = 120° + x. So angle ADC = (120 + x)/2. 

Since ABCD is cyclic, angle ADC + angle ABC = 180°. 

Angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC, which is arc AD + arc DC = z + y. So angle ABC = ½(z + y). 

Thus, angle ADC + angle ABC = ½(120 + x) + ½(z + y) = 180°. 

Substitute z = 240 - x - y. 

So, ½(120 + x) + ½((240 - x - y) + y) = 180. 

Simplify: ½(120 + x) + ½(240) = 180. 

Which becomes 60 + x/2 + 120 = 180 → x/2 = 0 → x = 0. That can't be right. So there's a mistake here. 

Wait, let me recheck. Arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC. Since arc AD is z, and arc DC is y. So arc ADC is z + y. Therefore, angle ABC = ½(z + y). 

And angle ADC = ½(arc ABC) = ½(120 + x). 

Adding them together: ½(120 + x) + ½(z + y) = 180. 

But z + y = 240 - x. 

So substituting: ½(120 + x) + ½(240 - x) = 180. 

Calculate: [120 + x + 240 - x]/2 = (360)/2 = 180. Which is true for any x. So this equation doesn't give us new information. 

So this approach leads to an identity, meaning we need another equation. 

Perhaps we need to involve angle at point D. 

Earlier, we said angle ADB = 60°, since it intercepts arc AB. So in triangle ABD, angle at D is 60°. Let me consider triangle ABD. 

In triangle ABD, we have angle at D = 60°, and we might need to find other angles. 

But what about angle at A or B? 

Angle at A in triangle ABD is angle BAD. Which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD. 

Measure of angle BAD = ½(arc BD). Arc BD is arc BC + arc CD = x + y. 

So angle BAD = ½(x + y). 

Similarly, angle at B in triangle ABD is angle ABD, which intercepts arc AD. Measure of angle ABD = ½(arc AD) = ½z. 

So in triangle ABD, angles are:

At D: 60°,

At A: ½(x + y),

At B: ½z.

Sum of angles in triangle is 180°:

60 + ½(x + y) + ½z = 180.

Multiply both sides by 2:

120 + x + y + z = 360.

But x + y + z = 240°, so 120 + 240 = 360. Which holds true. Again, no new info. 

So this approach isn't helping. 

Maybe I need to consider another angle. Let me think about triangle AOD. If I can find angle AOD, which is the central angle over arc AD, which is z. So angle AOD = z. 

But how to find z? 

Wait, since arc AB is 120°, and arc BC is x, arc CD is y, arc DA is z, with x + y + z = 240. 

Is there any other relation involving x, y, z? 

Perhaps looking at triangle ACB. In triangle ACB, we have angle at C = 60°, and if we can find other angles. 

Let me consider triangle ACB. Let's denote angle at A as α and angle at B as β. So α + β + 60 = 180 → α + β = 120°. 

Now, angle α is angle CAB, and angle β is angle ABC. 

Angle CAB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CB. So angle CAB = ½ arc CB = ½x. 

Angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC, which is arc AD + arc DC = z + y. So angle ABC = ½(z + y). 

So α + β = ½x + ½(z + y) = 120°. 

But x + y + z = 240°, so z + y = 240 - x. 

Substituting: ½x + ½(240 - x) = 120 → ½x + 120 - ½x = 120 → 120 = 120. Again, no new info. 

This means we need another equation to solve for z. 

Perhaps there's a relation from triangle AOD or other parts. 

Wait, what if we consider triangle AOD? If we can find angle AOD, which is z, and relate it to other angles. 

But without knowing anything about triangle AOD, it's difficult. 

Wait, maybe there's a property I'm missing. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet at the center. But I don't think that helps here. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB = 60°, and angle AOB = 120°, maybe there's a relationship between triangles ACB and AOB. 

For example, if we consider triangle ACB and triangle AOB, both have angle 60° and 120°, but not sure. 

Wait, in triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, and in triangle AOB, angle at O is 120°. If we can find a relationship between these triangles. 

Alternatively, maybe constructing triangle AOC or BOC. 

Let me think about triangle AOC. If I can find angle AOC, then I can find arc AC. 

Angle AOC is the central angle over arc AC, which is arc AB + arc BC = 120 + x. 

But without knowing x, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but angle at A in triangle ACB is ½x, as previously determined. And angle at B in triangle ACB is ½(z + y) = ½(240 - x). 

So, in triangle ACB, angle at A is ½x, angle at B is ½(240 - x), and angle at C is 60°. 

Their sum is ½x + ½(240 - x) + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180°, which checks out. 

Still no new information. 

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to think outside the box. The question asks for angle 9. Maybe it's a typo and refers to angle AOD, which is the central angle over arc AD. If I assume that angle AOD is the answer, and I need to find its measure. 

But how? 

Wait, let's consider that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have arc AB = 120°. Let me assume that arc BC = arc CD = arc DA. That is, x = y = z. Then, x + y + z = 240 → 3x = 240 → x = 80°. So arc BC = arc CD = arc DA = 80°. 

Then, angle AOD would be arc AD = 80°, so angle AOD = 80°. But 80° is not among the answer choices. 

But the answer choices are A. 60, B. 120, C. 240, D. 300. So 80 isn't there. 

Alternatively, maybe arc DA is 120°, making angle AOD = 120°, which is choice B. 

But why would arc DA be 120°? If arc DA is 120°, then arc BC + arc CD = 120°, but without justification. 

Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry. If arc AB is 120°, and if arc DA is also 120°, then arc BC + arc CD = 120°. But again, no basis for this. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB = 60°, which is half of angle AOB, maybe angle AOD is also related. 

Wait, if angle AOD is equal to angle AOB, which is 120°, then it would be choice B. But why? 

Unless there's a reason for arc AD to be equal to arc AB. But why? 

Without additional information, it's impossible to know. 

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to angle COD, which would be the central angle over arc CD. But again, without knowing arc CD, I can't say. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for angle at O, like angle AOD or something else. 

Wait, let me think again about the initial setup. Points A, B, C, D are on the circle. Lines AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral. Angles given: angle AOB = 120°, angle ACB = 60°. 

If I consider the central angles. We know angle AOB = 120°, and we need to find another central angle. 

If I can find arc AD, then angle AOD is that. 

But how? Let me think about the triangle ACB. 

In triangle ACB, angle at C is 60°, and if I can find other angles. 

As earlier, angle at A is ½x, angle at B is ½(240 - x). 

But if I assume that triangle ACB is equilateral? No, because angle at C is 60°, but angles at A and B would need to be 60° each, which would mean ½x = 60° → x = 120°, and ½(240 - x) = 60° → 240 - x = 120 → x = 120°. So x = 120°, which would make arc BC = 120°, arc AB = 120°, then arc CD + arc DA = 120°. 

But then, if arc BC = 120°, then arc BC is 120°, arc AB is 120°, and arc CD + arc DA = 120°. 

But without more info, this is speculative. 

If this were the case, then angle AOD would be arc DA, which could be any value between 0° and 120°. 

But if we assume that arc CD = arc DA, then each would be 60°, making angle AOD = 60°, which is choice A. 

But this is pure guesswork. 

Given that the answer choices are A. 60, B. 120, C. 240, D. 300, and the given angles are 120 and 60, it's likely that the answer is one of these. 

If I assume that angle AOD is 120°, which is the same as angle AOB, then choice B. 

Alternatively, if angle AOD is 60°, choice A. 

But why? 

Wait, let me think about the configuration. If arc AB is 120°, and if arc AD is also 120°, then angle AOD would be 120°. But why would arc AD be 120°? 

If the quadrilateral is symmetrical in some way, like AB and AD being equal arcs. 

But without knowing, this is speculation. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB is 60°, which is half of angle AOB, maybe there's a pattern. If angle AOD is also related. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB = 60°, and it's an inscribed angle over arc AB, then the central angle over arc AB is 120°. Similarly, if there's another inscribed angle over arc AD, then the central angle would be twice that. 

But without knowing the inscribed angle over arc AD, this is not helpful. 

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the given options. The given angles are 120° and 60°, and the options include 60, 120, 240, 300. 

If angle AOD is the central angle over arc AD, and if arc AD is 120°, then angle AOD is 120°, choice B. 

Or if arc AD is 60°, then angle AOD is 60°, choice A. 

But why would arc AD be 120°? 

Let me think: if arc AB is 120°, and if arc AD is also 120°, then the remaining arcs BC + CD = 120°. 

If arc BC is 60° and arc CD is 60°, then arc BC = arc CD = 60°, making arc DA = 120°. 

But why would that be? 

Because if I consider that angle ACB = 60°, which is half of arc AB (120°), and if arc BC is 60°, then angle ABC would be ½(arc ADC) = ½(arc AD + arc DC) = ½(120 + 60) = 90°. 

Then in triangle ACB, angles would be 60° at C, 90° at B, and 30° at A. 

But angle at A in triangle ACB is 30°, which would mean arc BC = 60°, since angle at A is ½ arc BC = 30° → arc BC = 60°. 

Yes! That works. So if arc BC is 60°, then arc BC = 60°, and arc CD is 60°, making arc DA = 240 - 60 - 60 = 120°. 

Thus, angle AOD = arc DA = 120°, which would be choice B. 

So this seems plausible. 

Let me verify. 

If arc BC = 60°, then in triangle ACB, angle at A is ½ arc BC = 30°, angle at B is ½(arc AD + arc DC) = ½(120 + 60) = 90°, angle at C is 60°, totaling 30+90+60=180°, which is correct. 

Thus, arc DA = 120°, making angle AOD = 120°, which is choice B. 

So the answer should be B.
