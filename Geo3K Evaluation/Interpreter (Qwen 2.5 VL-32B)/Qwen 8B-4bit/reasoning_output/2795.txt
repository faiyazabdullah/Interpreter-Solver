MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral WXYZ with points W, X, Y, Z connected in order, forming four sides: WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. The angles at each vertex are given in terms of a variable 'a', and there's a sum of all four angles equal to 360 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle Z, which I assume is the angle at point Z, so that would be angle YZW? Wait, the angles mentioned in the predicates are Angle(W,X,Y) which is angle at X, Angle(X,Y,Z) at Y, Angle(Y,Z,W) at Z, and Angle(Z,W,X) at W. Wait, no—let me check again.

Wait, the angles listed are:

Angle(W,X,Y): This is the angle at point X, formed by points W, X, Y.

Angle(X,Y,Z): Angle at Y, formed by X, Y, Z.

Angle(Y,Z,W): Angle at Z, formed by Y, Z, W.

Angle(Z,W,X): Angle at W, formed by Z, W, X.

So the four angles of the quadrilateral are at each vertex. The sum of these four angles is 360 degrees, as given by the last predicate.

Now, the measures of these angles are expressed in terms of 'a' and other expressions. Let me note down each angle's measure:

1. Measure of Angle(W,X,Y) = a. That's angle at X.

2. Measure of Angle(X,Y,Z) = Add(HalfOf(a), 8). So that's (a/2 + 8).

3. Measure of Angle(Y,Z,W) = Sub(a, 28). Which is (a - 28).

4. Measure of Angle(Z,W,X) = Add(a, 22). Which is (a + 22).

And the sum of these four angles equals 360 degrees. Therefore, adding them up:

a + (a/2 + 8) + (a - 28) + (a + 22) = 360.

Let me compute that equation step by step.

First, expand all terms:

a + a/2 + 8 + a - 28 + a + 22.

Combine like terms:

For the a terms: a + a/2 + a + a. Let's convert them to fractions. 

a is 2a/2, so total a terms:

2a/2 + a/2 + 2a/2 + 2a/2 = (2a + a + 2a + 2a)/2 = 7a/2?

Wait wait, let me do it properly.

Original terms:

First term: a (which is 1a)

Second term: a/2

Third term: a (another 1a)

Fourth term: a (another 1a)

Total a terms: 1a + 0.5a + 1a + 1a = 3.5a, which is 7a/2.

Then constants: 8 - 28 + 22.

Compute that: 8 - 28 is -20; -20 + 22 = 2.

Therefore, overall equation:

(7a/2) + 2 = 360.

Subtract 2 from both sides:

7a/2 = 358.

Multiply both sides by 2:

7a = 716.

Divide by 7:

a = 716 / 7.

Let me calculate that. 7*100=700, so 716-700=16. So 100 + 16/7 ≈ 100 + 2.2857 ≈ 102.2857 degrees.

But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check my calculation again.

Original sum:

a + (a/2 +8) + (a -28) + (a +22)

Breaking down:

a + a/2 +8 +a -28 +a +22.

Grouping variables:

a + a/2 + a + a = ?

That's 1a + 0.5a + 1a +1a = 3.5a, yes. Then constants: 8 -28 +22 = 2. Correct.

Thus equation: 3.5a + 2 = 360 → 3.5a = 358 → a = 358 / 3.5.

Convert 3.5 to fraction: 7/2. So dividing by 7/2 is multiplying by 2/7.

So a = 358 * 2 /7 = 716 /7 ≈ 102.2857 degrees.

Hmm. Now, the question is asking for m∠Z. From earlier, Angle(Y,Z,W) is the angle at Z, which is given as Sub(a,28). So that's a - 28.

So substituting a = 716/7 into that expression:

a - 28 = (716/7) - 28.

Convert 28 to sevenths: 28 = 196/7.

So 716/7 - 196/7 = (716 - 196)/7 = 520/7 ≈ 74.2857 degrees.

Wait, but none of the answer choices are close to that. The options are A.80, B.108, C.110, D.112.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting which angle corresponds to ∠Z. Let me double-check.

The problem says "Find m∠Z." In the given predicates, the angles are:

Angle(W,X,Y): At X.

Angle(X,Y,Z): At Y.

Angle(Y,Z,W): At Z.

Angle(Z,W,X): At W.

Yes, so Angle(Y,Z,W) is the angle at Z. So that should be a - 28. But according to the calculation above, that gives approximately 74.28 degrees, which isn't among the answer choices. That means I must have messed up something.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement again. Maybe I misread the angle labels.

Wait, the angles are defined as follows:

Angle(W,X,Y) – vertex at X.

Angle(X,Y,Z) – vertex at Y.

Angle(Y,Z,W) – vertex at Z.

Angle(Z,W,X) – vertex at W.

So the four angles of the quadrilateral are at vertices X, Y, Z, W respectively. Thus, the sum of these four angles is 360 degrees, which checks out with quadrilaterals.

But the problem asks for m∠Z, which is the angle at Z, i.e., Angle(Y,Z,W) which is a - 28. However, according to our calculation, that's about 74.28, which doesn't match any options. So where's the error?

Let me check the equations again.

Original equation: Sum of all four angles is 360.

Given:

Angle(W,X,Y) = a → angle at X: a

Angle(X,Y,Z) = Add(HalfOf(a), 8) → (a/2 + 8)

Angle(Y,Z,W) = Sub(a, 28) → (a - 28)

Angle(Z,W,X) = Add(a, 22) → (a + 22)

Sum: a + (a/2 +8) + (a -28) + (a +22) = 360.

Adding up:

a + a/2 +8 +a -28 +a +22.

Let me add term by term:

Start with a.

Add a/2: total so far is 1.5a.

Add 8: 1.5a +8.

Add a: 2.5a +8.

Subtract 28: 2.5a -20.

Add a: 3.5a -20.

Add 22: 3.5a +2.

So 3.5a +2 = 360 → 3.5a = 358 → a = 358 / 3.5.

Which is 358 divided by 3.5. Let me compute that more accurately.

Since 3.5 × 100 = 350. So 358 - 350 = 8. So 3.5 × 100 + 8 / 3.5 = 100 + 8/3.5 = 100 + 16/7 ≈ 100 + 2.2857 ≈ 102.2857.

So a ≈ 102.2857 degrees.

Then angle at Z is a -28 ≈ 102.2857 -28 ≈ 74.2857 degrees. Still not matching any options. Hmm. There's a contradiction here. Either I misread the angle labels, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, could the angle at Z be different? Let me think again. The angle at Z is Angle(Y,Z,W), which is the angle formed by points Y, Z, W. So that's indeed the angle at Z. So if the answer is supposed to be one of those choices, maybe I made an error in setting up the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to another angle? For example, sometimes in quadrilaterals, especially cyclic ones, opposite angles have certain relations, but the problem does not state that this is a cyclic quadrilateral. Also, since the sum of the angles is 360, which is standard for any quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in translating the predicates. Let me check again.

The given Equals(SumOf(...)) is 360. So the sum of all four angles is 360. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: Did I misinterpret the expressions for the angles?

Let me recheck the given predicates:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)), a) → angle at X is a.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,Y,Z)), Add(HalfOf(a), 8)) → angle at Y is (a/2 + 8).

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,W)), Sub(a, 28)) → angle at Z is (a - 28).

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)), Add(a, 22)) → angle at W is (a + 22).

So the four angles are:

X: a

Y: a/2 +8

Z: a -28

W: a +22

Sum: a + (a/2 +8) + (a -28) + (a +22) = 360.

Wait, let me re-calculate that sum again.

Expand each term:

Term1: a

Term2: a/2 +8

Term3: a -28

Term4: a +22

Add Term1 + Term2: a + a/2 +8 = (3a/2) +8

Add Term3: (3a/2 +8) + (a -28) = 3a/2 + a +8 -28 = (5a/2) -20

Add Term4: (5a/2 -20) + (a +22) = 5a/2 + a + (-20 +22) = (7a/2) +2

Set equal to 360:

7a/2 +2 = 360 → 7a/2 = 358 → a = (358 * 2)/7 = 716/7 ≈ 102.2857...

So angle at Z is a -28 = (716/7) -28.

Calculate that:

Convert 28 to sevenths: 28 = 196/7.

So 716/7 - 196/7 = (716 - 196)/7 = 520/7 ≈ 74.2857 degrees.

Still not matching any options. This suggests either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for a different angle? Like, maybe the angle at Z is not the one labeled Angle(Y,Z,W)? Or maybe the problem has a typo, but assuming the problem is correct, perhaps I need to check if there's an alternative way to interpret the angle measures.

Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is not convex, leading to negative angles? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in combining the terms.

Wait, let me try calculating 7a/2 +2 = 360 again.

So 7a/2 = 358 → a = (358 * 2)/7 = 716/7. Yes.

Then angle at Z is a -28 = 716/7 -28.

But 716 ÷7 is 102.2857... minus 28 gives 74.2857..., which is roughly 74.29 degrees. None of the answer choices are near that. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, looking back at the original problem, the user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)), a)"

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,Y,Z)), Add(HalfOf(a), 8))"

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,W)), Sub(a, 28))"

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z,W,X)), Add(a, 22))"

"Equals(SumOf(...), 360)"

Wait, could there be a mix-up between the angle measures? For instance, maybe the angle at Z is not Sub(a,28), but something else?

Wait, the angle at Z is Angle(Y,Z,W), which is the third angle in the list. According to the given, that's Sub(a,28). So that's a -28.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the angle at Z is Add(a, 22)? No, because the fourth angle is Add(a, 22), which is the angle at W.

Wait, unless there's a confusion between the angle labels. For example, perhaps the angle at Z is actually Angle(Z,W,X)? No, that's the angle at W.

Wait, perhaps I'm mislabeling the angles. Let me visualize the quadrilateral W-X-Y-Z-W.

So the vertices are in order W, X, Y, Z, back to W.

Each angle is at the vertex:

At X: between W-X-Y → Angle(W,X,Y)

At Y: between X-Y-Z → Angle(X,Y,Z)

At Z: between Y-Z-W → Angle(Y,Z,W)

At W: between Z-W-X → Angle(Z,W,X)

Yes, that's correct. So angle at Z is Angle(Y,Z,W), which is a -28.

But according to the calculation, this is around 74.28, which isn't an option. So there's a contradiction here. Perhaps there's a mistake in how I set up the equation.

Wait, let me try plugging in the answer choices and see if they fit.

Suppose the correct answer is C.110. Let's say m∠Z is 110 degrees. Then a -28 = 110 → a = 138 degrees.

Then compute the sum of the angles:

a = 138

Angle at X: 138

Angle at Y: 138/2 +8 = 69 +8 = 77

Angle at Z: 110

Angle at W: 138 +22 = 160

Sum: 138 +77 +110 +160 = let's compute:

138+77=215; 110+160=270; total 215+270=485. Not 360. So that's wrong.

Try option D: 112. Then angle at Z is 112 = a -28 → a = 140.

Then angles:

At X: 140

At Y: 140/2 +8 =70+8=78

At Z: 112

At W: 140+22=162

Sum: 140+78=218; 112+162=274; total 218+274=492. Still too high.

Option B: 108. Then a = 108 +28 = 136.

Angles:

At X: 136

At Y: 136/2 +8 =68+8=76

At Z: 108

At W: 136+22=158

Sum: 136+76=212; 108+158=266; total 212+266=478. Still over 360.

Option A: 80. Then a = 80 +28 = 108.

Angles:

At X: 108

At Y: 108/2 +8 =54+8=62

At Z: 80

At W: 108 +22 = 130

Sum: 108+62=170; 80+130=210; total 170+210=380. Closer, but still not 360.

Hmm. So none of the options give a total of 360. What's happening here?

Alternatively, maybe the angle at Z is not a -28, but another expression? Let me check again.

Wait, the problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,W)), Sub(a, 28))" — that's angle at Z. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if the angle at Z is instead the angle at W? No, the angle at W is Add(a,22). Or maybe the angle at Y?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me redo the equation:

Original sum:

a + (a/2 +8) + (a -28) + (a +22) = 360

Combine terms:

a + a/2 + a + a = 3.5a

Constants: 8 -28 +22 = 2

So equation: 3.5a + 2 = 360 → 3.5a = 358 → a = 358 / 3.5 = 102.2857...

So angle at Z is a -28 = 102.2857 -28 = 74.2857, which is approximately 74.29 degrees. But this isn't among the options. So there's a contradiction.

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I've misinterpreted the angle labels. Let me consider alternate interpretations.

Is there a chance that the angle at Z is not Angle(Y,Z,W) but another angle? For example, if the quadrilateral is named differently, like W, X, Y, Z, but maybe the order is different? Or perhaps the angle at Z is the external angle?

Wait, no. In a simple quadrilateral, the internal angles are at each vertex. So the angle at Z is definitely Angle(Y,Z,W).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different type of quadrilateral, such as a trapezoid or parallelogram, with some properties that allow us to use supplementary angles or other relations. But without additional information, we can't assume that.

Wait, but the sum of the angles is 360, which is always true for any quadrilateral, regardless of its type. So that part is correct.

Another thought: Could there be a miscalculation in translating the expressions? Let me check the given expressions again.

The second angle is Add(HalfOf(a), 8). So that's a/2 +8. Correct.

Third angle: Sub(a,28) → a -28. Correct.

Fourth angle: Add(a, 22) → a +22. Correct.

So the equations are correct. Hence, the problem may have a mistake, or perhaps the answer is not among the choices, but the options given are A-D. Since the options don't include 74.28, perhaps there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me try solving for a again, and then check if I made a mistake in arithmetic.

Equation: 3.5a + 2 = 360 → 3.5a = 358 → a = 358 / 3.5.

Let me calculate 358 divided by 3.5.

Note that 3.5 is 7/2. So dividing by 7/2 is multiplying by 2/7.

So a = 358 * 2 /7 = 716 /7.

Let me divide 716 by 7:

7*100 = 700 → 716-700=16 → 16/7 = 2 and 2/7.

So a = 102 + 2/7 degrees.

So a = 102° + (2/7)*60 minutes ≈ 102° 17.14 minutes, but that's not helpful.

Now, angle at Z is a -28 = 102.2857 -28 = 74.2857 degrees. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the sum of the angles equal to 360, but there's a mistake in the angle expressions. Let me check if changing one of the expressions would make the answer match.

For example, suppose the angle at Z is Add(a, 22) instead of Sub(a,28). Then angle at Z would be a +22. Let's try that.

Let me assume that there was a typo and the angle at Z is a +22. Then the sum would be:

a + (a/2 +8) + (a +22) + (a +22) = 360?

No, that would change the setup. But since I can't know, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at Z is HalfOf(a) +8? No, that's the angle at Y.

Wait, maybe the angle at Z is the angle at W, which is Add(a,22)? If that were the case, then the answer would be a +22. Let's try that.

Assume angle at Z is a +22. Then the equation becomes:

a (at X) + (a/2 +8) (at Y) + (a +22) (at Z) + (a -28) (at W) = 360?

Wait, but the original problem said:

Angle(Z,W,X) is Add(a,22), which is angle at W. So if the angle at Z is a +22, then the other angles would be different. This is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of angle measures. For example, maybe the angles are exterior angles? But no, the sum of interior angles is 360.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the quadrilateral is cyclic? In that case, opposite angles would sum to 180 degrees. Let's test that.

If it's cyclic, then angle at X + angle at Z = 180, and angle at Y + angle at W = 180.

From earlier, angle at X is a, angle at Z is a-28. So a + (a-28) = 2a -28 = 180 → 2a = 208 → a = 104.

Then angle at Y is a/2 +8 = 104/2 +8 = 52 +8 = 60.

Angle at W is a +22 = 104 +22 = 126.

Check angle Y + angle W: 60 +126 = 186 ≠ 180. So not cyclic.

But even if it's not cyclic, maybe there's some other relation.

But without knowing that, this is just guesswork.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects integer solutions, and there's a rounding error. Let's see. Suppose the actual value of a is such that a -28 is one of the options.

Let me try each option for m∠Z and see if the total becomes 360.

Option A: 80. So a -28 = 80 → a = 108.

Then:

Angle at X: a = 108

Angle at Y: a/2 +8 = 54 +8 = 62

Angle at Z: 80

Angle at W: a +22 = 108 +22 = 130

Sum: 108 +62 +80 +130 = 108+62=170; 80+130=210; total 170+210=380. Not 360.

Difference is 20 degrees. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers?

Option B: 108. So a -28 = 108 → a = 136.

Angles:

X: 136

Y: 136/2 +8 =68 +8=76

Z: 108

W: 136 +22=158

Sum: 136+76=212; 108+158=266; total 212+266=478. Too high.

Option C: 110. a = 110 +28 = 138.

Angles:

X: 138

Y: 138/2 +8 =69 +8=77

Z: 110

W: 138+22=160

Sum: 138+77=215; 110+160=270; total 215+270=485. Still too high.

Option D: 112. a = 112 +28 = 140.

Angles:

X: 140

Y: 140/2 +8=70+8=78

Z: 112

W: 140+22=162

Sum: 140+78=218; 112+162=274; total 218+274=492. Even higher.

None of these work. This suggests that either the problem has incorrect data, or I have a fundamental misunderstanding.

Wait, but the initial equation led to a = 716/7 ≈ 102.2857. So angle at Z is a -28 = 716/7 - 28 = 716/7 - 196/7 = 520/7 ≈ 74.2857. Is 520/7 reducible? Let me see: 520 divided by 7 is 74.2857. But maybe there's a calculation error.

Wait, 520 divided by 7: 7*74 = 518, so 520-518=2 → 74 and 2/7, which is approximately 74.2857. So that's correct.

But the options don't include this. So what's the issue?

Wait, maybe the problem meant that the sum of the angles is 360, but the angles are exterior angles? No, the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360, but for a quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles is 360. Exterior angles would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different type of figure, like a star quadrilateral, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in the sign of the expressions? For example, perhaps the angle at Z is Add(a, 28) instead of Sub(a,28)?

Let me try that scenario. Assume that the angle at Z is Add(a,28) = a +28.

Then the sum would be:

a (X) + (a/2 +8) (Y) + (a +28) (Z) + (a +22) (W) = 360.

Let's compute this:

a + a/2 +8 +a +28 +a +22.

Combine terms:

a + a/2 +a +a = 3.5a

Constants: 8 +28 +22 = 58.

So equation: 3.5a +58 = 360 → 3.5a = 302 → a = 302 /3.5 = 86.2857...

Then angle at Z is a +28 = 86.2857 +28 = 114.2857, which is close to option D: 112. But not exact. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if the angle at Z is a/2 +8, then angle at Y would be a/2 +8, but that's already taken. This is getting too speculative.

Perhaps there's a miscalculation in the original equation. Let me check once more.

Original equation: a + (a/2 +8) + (a -28) + (a +22) = 360.

Let me write all terms:

a + a/2 +8 +a -28 +a +22.

Combine like terms:

a + a + a + a/2 = 3a + a/2 = (6a/2 + a/2) = 7a/2.

Constants: 8 -28 +22 = (8 +22) -28 = 30 -28 = 2.

So equation: 7a/2 + 2 = 360 → 7a/2 = 358 → a = (358 * 2)/7 = 716/7.

Correct.

So angle at Z is a -28 = 716/7 - 28 = 716/7 - 196/7 = 520/7 ≈ 74.2857.

But none of the options match. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or the answer is not among the choices. However, since the options are given, perhaps I need to reconsider the interpretation of the angle at Z.

Wait, could the angle at Z be the angle at W? No, the angle at W is Add(a,22). Let me try assuming that the angle at Z is Add(a,22), which is the angle at W. Then, if that's the case, the angle at W would be a +22, and the angle at Z would be something else. But the problem says to find m∠Z, which is at Z. So this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at Z is the supplement of one of the other angles? For example, if the quadrilateral is cyclic, then angle at Z plus angle at X = 180. Let's try that.

If angle at Z + angle at X = 180, then (a -28) + a = 180 → 2a -28 = 180 → 2a = 208 → a = 104.

Then, let's compute other angles:

Angle at Y: a/2 +8 = 104/2 +8 = 52 +8 = 60.

Angle at W: a +22 = 104 +22 = 126.

Sum of angles: 104 +60 + (104-28) +126 = 104 +60 +76 +126 = 104+60=164; 76+126=202; total 164+202=366. Close to 360, but not quite. Difference is 6 degrees. This suggests that if the quadrilateral were cyclic, there's a discrepancy, possibly due to rounding or a mistake.

But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, where opposite angles are equal. Let's see:

If it's a parallelogram, then angle at X = angle at Z, and angle at Y = angle at W.

From given:

Angle at X = a.

Angle at Z = a -28.

If they are equal, then a = a -28 → 0 = -28, which is impossible. So not a parallelogram.

Alternatively, if it's a trapezoid, but without knowing which sides are parallel, this is hard to apply.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the calculations, the angle at Z is approximately 74.29 degrees, which is not among the options. However, since the options are given, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me re-express 520/7 as a mixed number: 520 divided by 7 is 74 with remainder 2, so 74 2/7 degrees. If we approximate this as 74.29, which is close to 74.3, but none of the options match.

Wait, but the options are A.80, B.108, C.110, D.112. All higher than 74.29. This suggests that perhaps the problem had a different configuration, such as a pentagon or another shape, but the given predicates describe a quadrilateral.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at Z is not the internal angle but the external angle? Let's explore that.

If the angle at Z is the external angle, then it would be 180 - internal angle. But the sum of external angles of any polygon is 360. But in a quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is 360, so the sum of external angles would be 360 as well. But this is not helpful here.

Alternatively, if the angle at Z is an external angle, then:

External angle at Z = 180 - (a -28) = 180 -a +28 = 208 -a.

But this would require knowing more about the other external angles, which we don't.

This is not leading anywhere.

Given that the calculations consistently lead to approximately 74.29 degrees, and none of the options match, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem's parameters. However, since I must choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me try one last thing: perhaps the angle at Z is Add(a, 22), which is the angle at W. If that were the case, then m∠Z would be a +22. Let's try that.

If angle at Z is a +22, then the sum would be:

a (X) + (a/2 +8) (Y) + (a +22) (Z) + (a -28) (W) = 360.

Compute:

a + a/2 +8 +a +22 +a -28.

Combine terms:

a + a/2 +a +a = 3.5a

Constants: 8 +22 -28 = 2.

So equation: 3.5a +2 = 360 → same as before, leading to a = 716/7 ≈ 102.2857.

Then angle at Z is a +22 = 102.2857 +22 = 124.2857, which is closer to option D: 112, but still not matching.

However, if there was a mistake in the problem, and the angle at Z is Add(a, 22), then the answer would be approximately 124.29, which is not an option either.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's likely an error in the problem's setup or the given answer choices. However, since I must provide an answer, and considering the closest approximation, perhaps there's a calculation mistake in the problem's creation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original equation should have been SumOf(...) = 360, but with a different combination. For example, if the angle at Z is Add(a, 22), and the angle at W is Sub(a, 28), then the sum would be:

a + (a/2 +8) + (a +22) + (a -28) = 360.

Which is a + a/2 +8 +a +22 +a -28 = 3.5a + 2 = 360 → same as before, leading to a = 716/7.

Then angle at Z would be a +22 = 716/7 +22 = 716/7 + 154/7 = 870/7 ≈ 124.2857, still not matching.

Given all this, I'm unable to reconcile the calculations with the provided answer choices. However, if I must choose from the given options, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's construction, and the intended answer is D: 112, assuming that there was a typo and the angle at Z is Add(a, 22) with a different value.

Alternatively, if I assume that the equation was meant to have the sum equal to 360, but with a different coefficient, like 3.5a - 2 = 360, leading to a = 362/3.5 = 103.42857, making angle at Z = a -28 = 75.42857, still not matching.

In conclusion, despite careful calculations, the correct value based on the given information is approximately 74.29 degrees, which is not among the options. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, and assuming there might be a transcription error, the closest possible answer might be A: 80, but this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's creation, and the intended answer is B: 108, but this requires adjusting the equations.

Given the lack of alignment, I'll proceed with the calculated value, but since the options don't match, I'll have to select the closest possible, though this is uncertain. However, given the options, and if there's an error in the problem's angle definitions, perhaps the intended answer is B: 108, assuming that the angle at Z is a/2 +8, leading to a different calculation. But this is purely speculative.

Alternatively, if there's a miscalculation in the problem's angle expressions, and the angle at Z is Add(a, 22), then with a = 108, the angle at Z would be 130, which is also not an option.

I'm at an impasse. Given the strict instructions to select from the options, and assuming that there might be a mistake in the problem, I'll choose the closest possible answer based on recalculating with possible errors.

Wait, let me try one more time: if the angle at Z is Add(a, 22), and the sum is 360, then:

a + (a/2 +8) + (a +22) + (a -28) = 360.

As before, this leads to 3.5a + 2 = 360 → a = 716/7 ≈ 102.2857.

Then angle at Z is a +22 = 102.2857 +22 = 124.2857, which is approximately 124.29. The closest option is D: 112, but it's still off. If there was a typo and the angle at Z is Add(a, 22) - 12, then 124.29 -12 = 112.29, which would be option D. This is pure speculation, but given the options, D is the closest.

Thus, I'll select D: 112 as the answer, assuming a possible typo in the problem.
