Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the length of AB, given some geometric predicates. Let me start by understanding all the given information.

First, there are several points mentioned: G, A, B, E, D, F, C. Lines connecting them too. Also, some triangles and angles. The key thing here is that EB is parallel to DC, and we have some similar triangles involved. 

Let me list out the given predicates again to make sure I don't miss anything. There's Triangle(G,A,B) and Triangle(E,D,B). Points are defined for each of these letters. Then there are lines like Line(G,A), Line(A,B), Line(G,B), etc. Angles at GAB, EDB, and FDE are right angles. Also, some lengths are given: Length of GB is 10, ED is 4, DC is 5. And AB is expressed as x-2, where x is the value we need to find. Also, similarity between triangles EDB and GAB, with corresponding sides ED and GB, and EB and AB.

So, since there's a similarity between triangles EDB and GAB, maybe I can use the property of similar triangles here. Similar triangles have proportional sides. The correspondence of sides is given: CorrespondingSides(Line(E,D), Line(G,B)) and CorrespondingSides(Line(E,B), Line(A,B)). Wait, so Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B), with ED corresponding to GB, and EB corresponding to AB? Or wait, the order matters. In similar triangles, the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So if Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B), then angle E corresponds to angle G, angle D corresponds to angle A, and angle B corresponds to angle B? Wait, but the angles: Angle EDB is a right angle, and Angle GAB is also a right angle. So those would correspond. So the right angles are at D and A respectively?

Wait, the RightAngle predicates say Angle(G,A,B) is right, so that's angle at A. Similarly, Angle(E,D,B) is right, so angle at D. And Angle(F,D,E) is right, but maybe that's another part. But focusing on the similar triangles first.

Since Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B), the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. The corresponding sides are ED corresponds to GB, and EB corresponds to AB. Because the correspondence is based on the order of the triangle names. So Triangle(E,D,B) corresponds to Triangle(G,A,B), so side ED in the first triangle corresponds to side GA in the second? Wait, no. Wait, the order of the vertices defines the correspondence. So vertex E in Triangle(E,D,B) corresponds to vertex G in Triangle(G,A,B), vertex D corresponds to A, and vertex B corresponds to B. Wait, but that would mean that angle at E corresponds to angle at G, angle at D corresponds to angle at A, and angle at B corresponds to angle at B. Hmm, but angle at B is common? Wait, but Triangle(E,D,B) has angle at B, and Triangle(G,A,B) also has angle at B. So that suggests that the two triangles share angle at B? But how?

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. Let me think again. Since the RightAngles are at D and A, perhaps the right angles correspond. So in Triangle(E,D,B), the right angle is at D, so that would correspond to the right angle at A in Triangle(G,A,B). Therefore, the correspondence would be such that ED corresponds to GA, DB corresponds to AB, and EB corresponds to GB? Wait, this is confusing. Maybe it's better to write down the ratios based on the corresponding sides.

Given the CorrespondingSides(Line(E,D), Line(G,B)): So ED corresponds to GB. And CorrespondingSides(Line(E,B), Line(A,B)): So EB corresponds to AB. Therefore, the ratio of ED / GB = EB / AB. Since ED is 4, GB is 10. So substituting, 4/10 = EB / AB. Which simplifies to 2/5 = EB / AB. Therefore, AB = (5/2)*EB. But we need to find AB, so we need to find EB.

But how do we find EB? Let's see. We also know that EB is parallel to DC. From the Parallel predicate: Line(E,B) || Line(D,C). Also, DC is given as length 5. Wait, DC is part of the line from D to C, and since DC is 5 units long. Also, Line(D,C) is connected to point C, which is connected to B via Line(C,B). So maybe there's a way to relate EB and DC through the parallel lines?

Since EB || DC, and DC is part of triangle DBC? Wait, Line(D,C) connects D to C, and Line(C,B) connects C to B. So DC is one side of triangle DBC? Not sure yet. Alternatively, since EB is parallel to DC, maybe we can consider some proportionality because of the transversal lines?

Also, note that Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C). So if we can find some transversals intersecting these lines, we could use the properties of parallel lines and similar triangles. For example, if there's a transversal cutting EB and DC, creating proportional segments.

But let me check if there's more info. Also, Triangle(E,D,B) is similar to Triangle(G,A,B). So their sides are proportional. Earlier, we had ED/GB = EB/AB = DB/GA. Wait, but we don't know GA or DB. However, maybe we can find other relations.

Alternatively, since EB is parallel to DC, maybe triangle EBD is similar to some other triangle? Wait, DC is part of Line(D,C), which is connected to point C. Also, Line(D,C) has length 5. Since DC is 5, and DC is parallel to EB, maybe we can set up proportions involving DC and EB.

Alternatively, since DC is part of a line that goes from D to C, and Line(D,C) is parallel to EB. So if we can find a relationship between DC and EB through some similar triangles or parallelograms?

Wait, let's try to look at the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate the lengths. But without loss of generality, maybe coordinate geometry could work here.

Alternatively, using vectors or slopes. Since EB is parallel to DC, their slopes are equal. But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, going back to the similar triangles. Let's focus on Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B). So the ratio of similarity is ED / GB = 4 / 10 = 2/5. So all corresponding sides are in the ratio 2:5. That means that EB / AB = 2/5, so AB = (5/2) EB. Also, DB / GA = 2/5. But we don't know GA or DB. But maybe DB is related to DC?

Wait, DC is given as 5. Is DC part of the triangle? Let me check. Line(D,C) is present, and Point(C) is connected to B via Line(C,B). So Line(D,C) is connected to C, which is connected to B. So DC is a side of triangle DBC? But how does that relate to other parts?

Wait, since Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C), and considering that Line(D,C) is connected to C and B, perhaps there's a transversal that creates similar triangles. For instance, if we take Line(E,B) || Line(D,C), then if there's a line connecting E to D, which is part of the original triangle, but not sure.

Alternatively, since Line(E,B) || Line(D,C), then the distance between these lines might be constant, but not sure if helpful.

Wait, but maybe triangle EBD is similar to triangle something else? Wait, if EB || DC, then maybe triangle EBD is similar to triangle CBD? Wait, not sure. Let me think about the angles. Since EB || DC, then angle between EB and BD would be equal to angle between DC and BD. But BD is a common side? Wait, BD is part of Triangle EDB and Triangle DBC?

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, then the triangles formed by these lines with other lines could be similar. For example, if we consider Line(DB) intersecting EB and DC, then maybe the triangles created by that intersection are similar.

Wait, Line(DB) connects D to B. Since EB || DC, and Line(DB) intersects both lines. So, the triangle EDB and triangle CDB? Wait, but DC is parallel to EB, and they're cut by the transversal DB. So by the converse of Thales' theorem, the ratio of the segments would be equal. Wait, but how?

Let me recall that if two lines are cut by a transversal, and the lines are parallel, then the segments are proportional. So, in this case, EB || DC, and they are cut by the transversal DB. So, the ratio of the distances from D to EB and from D to DC would be equal to the ratio of EB to DC. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe using intercept theorem (Thales' theorem).

The intercept theorem states that if two lines are cut by transversals, then the segments are proportional. But since EB || DC, and assuming that they are cut by a transversal, then the ratio of the lengths of EB and DC would be equal to the ratio of the distances from the point where the transversal meets the lines.

But I need to figure out which segments to compare. Let me consider that Line(DB) cuts EB and DC. So, starting from point D, going to B. Since DC is a segment from D to C, and EB is a segment from E to B. Wait, but DC is from D to C, while EB is from E to B. So the transversal here would be the line DB, which starts at D and ends at B. But DC is from D to C, and EB is from E to B. So maybe the intersection points are D (for DC) and B (for EB)? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle EBD and triangle CDB. Wait, if EB || DC, then angle EBD equals angle BDC (corresponding angles). Also, angle at D is common? Wait, angle EDB is a right angle, as per the given RightAngle(E,D,B). So angle at D is 90 degrees. If EB || DC, then angle between DC and DB would be equal to angle between EB and DB. So angle between DC and DB is same as angle between EB and DB. Therefore, triangle EBD and triangle CDB may be similar? Let me check.

In triangle EBD, angle at D is 90°, and in triangle CDB, angle at D is... Well, angle at D is part of triangle DBC. Wait, unless DC is parallel to EB, making some angles equal. This seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Earlier, from the similar triangles EDB and GAB, we have the ratio of ED/GB = 2/5, so ED=4, GB=10. Thus, the ratio is 2:5. So all corresponding sides are in this ratio. So, for example, EB / AB = 2/5, so AB = (5/2) EB. Also, DB / GA = 2/5. But we need to find AB, so we need to find EB. How?

We also know that DC is 5, and DC is parallel to EB. Maybe DC and EB are corresponding sides in some similar triangles? Wait, DC is part of Line(D,C), which is parallel to Line(E,B). So if we can find a relation between DC and EB through the similar triangles or other properties.

Looking back, Line(D,C) is length 5, and Line(E,B) is unknown. Since they are parallel, maybe there's a way to express EB in terms of DC using the other similar triangles.

Wait, earlier, we had Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B). So the ratio between ED and GB is 2:5. Also, the ratio between DB and GA is 2:5. Additionally, the ratio between EB and AB is 2:5. Now, if we can find DB or GA, that might help.

But how? Let's think about the other given information. We have Line(D,C) which is length 5. Also, Line(C,B) is connected. So, point C is connected to B. If we can relate DC to other sides.

Wait, since Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B), and Line(D,C) has length 5, and Line(E,B) has length EB. Perhaps there's a way to connect these via triangle similarities or proportions.

Wait, let me think about triangle DBC. Since DC is 5 and CB is connected. But I don't know CB's length. However, if EB || DC, then maybe triangle EBD is similar to triangle CBD? Wait, angle at D is 90°, and if DC || EB, then angle between DC and DB would be equal to angle between EB and DB. So, angle at D in triangle EBD (which is 90°) and angle at D in triangle CBD (which is angle between DC and DB). But unless angle CBD is also 90°, which isn't stated. So maybe not directly similar.

Alternatively, since EB || DC, then the ratio of EB to DC would be equal to the ratio of distances from some point. For example, if there is a point where lines EB and DC are cut by another transversal, the ratio of the segments would be equal. But without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that DC is part of triangle DBC, and EB is parallel to DC. If we consider triangle DBC, and draw EB parallel to DC, then maybe EB divides some other triangle proportionally. But I need to visualize this.

Alternatively, since Triangle(E,D,B) is similar to Triangle(G,A,B), and we have ED=4, GB=10, so the ratio is 2:5. Therefore, EB/AB = 2/5, so AB = (5/2) EB. Also, since DC is parallel to EB, and DC is 5, maybe there's another pair of similar triangles involving DC and EB.

Wait, suppose we consider triangle DBC and triangle EBA? Or some other combination. Wait, DC is parallel to EB, so if there's a line connecting C to E or something else...

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, and Line(D,C) is connected to C, which is connected to B. So, Line(D,C) is from D to C, and Line(C,B) is from C to B. So, Line(D,C) and Line(E,B) are parallel. So, if we imagine extending some lines, but I'm not seeing it immediately.

Wait, another thought: since Triangle(E,D,B) is similar to Triangle(G,A,B), and ED corresponds to GB, and EB corresponds to AB. Also, we can compute the length of EB using the other sides. Wait, in Triangle(E,D,B), which is a right triangle (since Angle(E,D,B) is right), so ED=4, DB=?, EB=?. Using Pythagoras, ED² + DB² = EB². But we don't know DB. However, from the similarity, DB corresponds to GA. But GA is part of Triangle(G,A,B), which is also a right triangle (Angle(G,A,B) is right). So GA and AB are legs of that triangle, and GB is hypotenuse (since GB=10). Wait, but in Triangle(G,A,B), which is right-angled at A. So GA and AB are the legs, and GB is the hypotenuse. So GA² + AB² = GB². But we don't know GA or AB. However, from the similarity ratio, GA corresponds to DB. So GA = (5/2) DB. Because the ratio of similarity is 2:5 (ED/GB = 4/10 = 2/5), so corresponding sides are multiplied by 5/2. So GA = (5/2) DB. Therefore, substituting into the equation GA² + AB² = GB²:

[(5/2 DB)]² + AB² = 10²  
=> (25/4) DB² + AB² = 100.

But also, from Triangle(E,D,B): ED² + DB² = EB² => 4² + DB² = EB² => 16 + DB² = EB².

And from earlier, AB = (5/2) EB. So substituting EB = (2/5) AB into the above equation:

From AB = (5/2) EB => EB = (2/5) AB.

Substituting into 16 + DB² = (2/5 AB)^2 => 16 + DB² = (4/25) AB².

Now, substitute GA = (5/2) DB into the equation from the big triangle:

(25/4) DB² + AB² = 100.

But we have two equations:

1) 16 + DB² = (4/25) AB²  
2) (25/4) DB² + AB² = 100

Let me denote AB as x, which is the variable we need to find. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2). So AB = x - 2. Wait, the problem asks us to find AB, which is x-2, but the options are numerical. So maybe x is the variable, and we need to find AB = x - 2. But the answer choices are numbers, so likely AB is one of the options, and x is just a placeholder. So let me clarify:

The problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2). So AB = x - 2. But the question is to find AB, so once we find x, subtract 2 to get AB. Wait, but the answer choices are numerical, so maybe x is the value of AB plus 2? Not sure. Wait, but the user said "Find AB", so AB is the quantity we need. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The question is: "E B ∥ D C. Find A B."

So AB is the value we need to find. Given that Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2), which implies that x is some variable representing AB + 2. But since the answer choices are fixed, maybe x is not needed, and we can proceed to find AB directly.

But regardless, let's go back to the equations.

We have two equations:

Equation 1: 16 + DB² = (4/25) AB²  
Equation 2: (25/4) DB² + AB² = 100

Let me express DB² from Equation 1:

DB² = (4/25) AB² - 16

Plugging into Equation 2:

(25/4)[ (4/25) AB² - 16 ] + AB² = 100  
Simplify:

(25/4)*(4/25 AB²) - (25/4)*16 + AB² = 100  
Which becomes:

AB² - 100 + AB² = 100  
Combine like terms:

2 AB² - 100 = 100  
Add 100 to both sides:

2 AB² = 200  
Divide by 2:

AB² = 100  
Take square root:

AB = 10 or AB = -10 (discard negative)

So AB = 10. But wait, the answer choices include D as 10. But wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), x - 2). So if AB = 10, then x - 2 = 10 → x = 12. But why did we get AB = 10? Let me verify the calculation again.

Wait, the equations were derived under the assumption that the similarity ratio was 2:5, leading to AB being 10. But according to the given data, there's another piece of information: DC is 5. Did we use that in our equations? No. Wait, DC is 5, but in our equations, we didn't use DC. That seems like a mistake. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Here's the issue. In the previous reasoning, I used the similarity between Triangles EDB and GAB, leading to the ratio of ED/GB = 2/5, and from that derived AB = (5/2) EB. But I didn't involve DC = 5. However, since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, there must be a connection here. So my earlier equations missed incorporating DC's length. Hence, the error.

So I need to revise the approach. Let me try again.

We have Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B) with ratio 2:5 (from ED/GB = 4/10 = 2/5). Therefore, all corresponding sides are in 2:5 ratio. So:

ED corresponds to GB (ratio 2:5),  
DB corresponds to GA,  
EB corresponds to AB.

Therefore, EB / AB = 2/5 ⇒ AB = (5/2) EB. Also, DC is parallel to EB. Since DC is 5, and DC is a side of triangle DBC, perhaps there's a way to relate DC to EB through some other triangle or proportion.

But how? Let me consider the line DC parallel to EB. If we can form a triangle where DC and EB are corresponding sides. For example, if we consider the line DC and the line EB, which are parallel, and they are cut by the transversal DB. Then, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also called Thales' theorem), the ratio of the segments on the transversal would be equal.

Wait, the Basic Proportionality Theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. But in this case, DC is parallel to EB, and they are cut by the transversal DB. So, perhaps applying this theorem to triangle EBD?

Wait, but DC is not a side of triangle EBD. It's a separate line. Alternatively, if we consider triangle DBC, where DC is a side, and EB is parallel to DC. If we can find a line that connects to EB and forms a triangle with DC.

Alternatively, think of DC and EB as two parallel lines, and Line(DB) intersecting them. Then, the ratio of the lengths of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the intersection point.

Wait, if we consider point D, which is on both DC and DB. Wait, DC starts at D and goes to C. EB starts at E and goes to B. So, if we consider the line DB, which starts at D and goes to B. Since DC is parallel to EB, then the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of the segments on DB.

Wait, more formally, if two lines are cut by a transversal, then the ratio of the segments on one line equals the ratio of the segments on the other line. But since DC and EB are parallel, and they are cut by the transversal DB, then the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of the distances from D to the respective lines. But since both lines pass through D? No, DC starts at D, and EB starts at E. So the transversal DB intersects DC at D and EB at B. Wait, but that would imply that the ratio is DC / EB = DB / BB? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, and they are cut by the transversal DB, then the ratio of DC to EB is equal to the ratio of the segments of DB. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of it as follows: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding segments are proportional. But I need to identify which segments.

Wait, maybe the key is that since DC || EB, then the triangles formed by these lines with the same base or height are similar. For example, if we consider triangle DBC and triangle EBA, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, then the ratio of DC to EB is equal to the ratio of their distances from a certain point. But without knowing the position of the points, it's tricky.

Wait, but we have another piece of information: DC is 5, and we need to relate it to EB. Let's assume that the ratio of DC to EB is the same as the ratio of DB to something else. Let me think about the similar triangles again.

We know from the similarity of triangles EDB and GAB that the ratio is 2:5. So, for example, DB corresponds to GA. Also, since DC is parallel to EB, and DC is part of the line from D to C, which connects to B. Maybe DC is part of triangle DBC, and EB is part of triangle EBD. If we can find a relation between DC and EB through triangle DBC.

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, then triangle DBC and triangle EBD might have some relation. Let me try to explore this.

In triangle DBC, DC = 5, and in triangle EBD, EB is unknown. If DC || EB, then angle at D is common? No, because DC is part of triangle DBC, and EB is part of triangle EBD. But angle between DC and DB is equal to angle between EB and DB (since DC || EB). So, maybe triangles DBC and EBD are similar?

Wait, let's check angles. In triangle DBC, angle at D is between DC and DB. In triangle EBD, angle at D is between EB and DB. Since DC || EB, these angles are equal. Also, angle at B in triangle DBC is angle between BC and BD, and in triangle EBD, angle at B is between BE and BD. Are these angles equal? Not necessarily, unless there's more information.

However, if we assume that triangles DBC and EBD are similar, then we could set up proportions. But I need to confirm if the angles are equal.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, and if we can find another pair of angles equal, then the triangles would be similar. But I don't have enough info.

Wait, let me try to use the earlier equations again, but this time including DC.

Previously, I derived AB = 10, but that didn't use DC = 5. Clearly, that's incorrect, so I must have made a mistake in the earlier derivation. Let me revisit.

From the similarity of triangles EDB and GAB, we have ED/GB = 2/5, so ED = 4, GB = 10. Also, EB/AB = 2/5, so EB = (2/5) AB. 

Now, since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, maybe there's a way to relate DC to EB through the triangles. For example, if we consider triangle DBC and triangle EBD.

Wait, if DC || EB, then the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of DB to some segment. Let me consider the line DC and EB being parallel, and the line DB intersecting them. So, the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of the distances from D to the lines. But since DC starts at D, the distance from D to DC is zero, which doesn't help. Alternatively, if we extend EB and DC until they meet at a point, forming a triangle. But without knowing where they meet, this is unclear.

Another idea: Since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, and from the earlier ratio, EB = (2/5) AB. If we can express DC in terms of AB, then we can solve for AB.

But how?

Let me think about the entire diagram. Let's consider triangle DBC, where DC = 5. If EB || DC, then maybe triangle EBD is similar to triangle CDA or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, and Line(D,C) is part of triangle DBC, maybe there's a translation or scaling factor between DC and EB. For example, if DC is scaled by a factor to get EB.

But without knowing the scale factor, it's hard to say. However, since we know DC = 5 and EB is related to AB, which is related to the similarity ratio.

Wait, from the similar triangles EDB and GAB, we know that the ratio of similarity is 2:5. So, every length in triangle EDB is 2/5 of the corresponding length in triangle GAB.

So, for example, DB in triangle EDB corresponds to GA in triangle GAB. So DB = (2/5) GA.

Also, in triangle GAB, which is a right triangle at A, GA and AB are the legs, and GB is the hypotenuse (10). So GA² + AB² = GB² = 100.

But from the similarity ratio, GA = (2/5) DB. Wait, no: the ratio is ED/GB = 2/5. So the ratio of corresponding sides is 2:5. So DB corresponds to GA, so DB/GA = 2/5. Hence, DB = (2/5) GA.

But we also have from the right triangle EDB: ED² + DB² = EB². ED = 4, so 16 + DB² = EB².

From earlier, EB = (2/5) AB. So substituting:

16 + DB² = (2/5 AB)^2 = (4/25) AB².

Also, from the right triangle GAB: GA² + AB² = 100.

But GA = (5/2) DB (since DB = (2/5) GA → GA = (5/2) DB).

Substitute GA into the equation:

[(5/2 DB)]² + AB² = 100  
→ (25/4) DB² + AB² = 100.

Now, we have two equations:

1) 16 + DB² = (4/25) AB²  
2) (25/4) DB² + AB² = 100

Let me solve these equations together.

From equation 1: DB² = (4/25) AB² - 16.

Plug this into equation 2:

(25/4) [(4/25) AB² - 16] + AB² = 100  
Simplify inside the brackets:

(25/4)(4/25 AB²) - (25/4)*16 + AB² = 100  
→ AB² - 100 + AB² = 100  
→ 2 AB² - 100 = 100  
→ 2 AB² = 200  
→ AB² = 100  
→ AB = 10.

But this gives AB = 10, but this ignores the DC = 5. Why? Because in this derivation, I didn't use DC = 5, which suggests that there's an inconsistency. This indicates that either the assumption is wrong, or there's missing information.

Wait, but where is DC = 5 used? It wasn't used in this derivation. This suggests that there's an error in the approach. Let me think again.

Perhaps there's another relation involving DC. Since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, and EB is related to AB via the similarity ratio. Maybe there's a way to relate DC to EB through the similar triangles.

For example, if we consider triangle DBC and triangle EBD, but I need to establish similarity. Let's assume that triangle DBC is similar to triangle EBD. If so, then DC/EB = DB/ED = BC/BD.

But we know DC = 5, ED = 4. If this similarity holds, then DC/EB = ED/DB → 5/EB = 4/DB → DB = (4/5) EB.

But from earlier, in the similar triangles EDB and GAB, we have DB = (2/5) GA, and GA = (5/2) DB. Wait, this might be conflicting.

Alternatively, if triangle DBC ~ triangle EBD, then DC/EB = DB/ED = BC/BD.

Assuming DC/EB = ED/DB → 5/EB = 4/DB → DB = (4/5) EB.

But from the earlier similarity between EDB and GAB, we have DB = (2/5) GA, and GA = (5/2) DB. So combining these, we have DB = (2/5) GA → GA = (5/2) DB.

But if DB = (4/5) EB, then GA = (5/2)*(4/5) EB = 2 EB.

Now, in triangle GAB, which is right-angled at A, GA and AB are the legs, and GB = 10. So GA^2 + AB^2 = 100.

But GA = 2 EB, and AB = (5/2) EB (from earlier). So substituting:

(2 EB)^2 + ((5/2) EB)^2 = 100  
→ 4 EB² + (25/4) EB² = 100  
→ (16/4 + 25/4) EB² = 100  
→ (41/4) EB² = 100  
→ EB² = (100 * 4)/41 = 400/41  
→ EB = sqrt(400/41) ≈ 3.12, but this doesn't seem to align with anything.

This suggests that assuming triangle DBC ~ EBD might not be valid, or that there's another relation needed.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, and DC = 5, and from the earlier equations, we might need to relate DC to EB through the triangles.

Wait, let me recall that Line(D,C) is parallel to Line(E,B), and DC = 5. Also, from the earlier similarity between EDB and GAB, we have AB = (5/2) EB. If I can express EB in terms of DC, then I can find AB.

But how? Let me think about the entire figure. Since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, and EB is a side of triangle EDB, which is similar to triangle GAB. Maybe there's a way to link DC to the other sides.

Alternatively, since DC is part of Line(D,C), and Line(C,B) connects to B. If I can find CB's length, then maybe combine it with DC to form a relation.

But I don't have information about CB. However, if I consider triangle DBC, which has DC = 5 and CB as one side. But without knowing CB, it's difficult.

Wait, but from the earlier equations, we found AB = 10, which would mean that EB = (2/5)*10 = 4. But ED is also 4. So in triangle EDB, ED = 4, EB = 4, and it's a right triangle. So that would make it an isosceles right triangle, with legs of 4 and 4, and hypotenuse EB = 4√2. But this contradicts the earlier calculation where EB = 4. Wait, no, if ED = 4, and EB = 4, then the hypotenuse would be sqrt(4² + 4²) = sqrt(32) = 4√2. But in our earlier derivation, we assumed that EB = (2/5) AB. If AB = 10, then EB = 4, which would make the hypotenuse EB = 4√2. But this doesn't involve DC = 5. So where is DC coming into play?

This suggests that the earlier derivation is missing something. Perhaps the assumption that the similarity ratio applies to all sides is incorrect? Or perhaps the correspondence of sides in the similar triangles is different.

Let me double-check the correspondence of the similar triangles. The problem states: Similar(Triangle(E,D,B), Triangle(G,A,B)), and CorrespondingSides(Line(E,D), Line(G,B)) and CorrespondingSides(Line(E,B), Line(A,B)).

So, the correspondence is: Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), and Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B). This means that the similarity is such that angle at E corresponds to angle at G, angle at D corresponds to angle at A, and angle at B corresponds to angle at B. Wait, but angle at B is common? So the triangles share angle at B?

Wait, in Triangle(E,D,B), the angles are at E, D, B. In Triangle(G,A,B), the angles are at G, A, B. So the correspondence would be E->G, D->A, B->B. So the similarity is such that angle at E corresponds to angle at G, angle at D corresponds to angle at A, and angle at B corresponds to angle at B. This would mean that the triangles are similar with the order E-D-B ~ G-A-B.

Thus, the sides opposite these angles would correspond. So side ED in Triangle EDB corresponds to side GA in Triangle GAB, side DB corresponds to AB, and side EB corresponds to GB.

Wait, no: in similar triangles, the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So, if Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B), then side ED corresponds to side GA, side DB corresponds to side AB, and side EB corresponds to side GB. Wait, no. Wait, the correspondence is E -> G, D -> A, B -> B. So:

- Side ED in Triangle EDB corresponds to side GA in Triangle GAB (since E->G and D->A).
- Side DB in Triangle EDB corresponds to side AB in Triangle GAB (since D->A and B->B).
- Side EB in Triangle EDB corresponds to side GB in Triangle GAB (since E->G and B->B).

So the ratios are ED/GA = DB/AB = EB/GB.

Given that, ED = 4, GB = 10, so ED/GB = 4/10 = 2/5. So ED/GA = 2/5 → GA = (5/2)*ED = (5/2)*4 = 10. Wait, but GB is already 10. So GA = 10? That would mean in triangle GAB, GA = 10, AB is some value, and GB = 10. But triangle GAB is right-angled at A, so GA and AB are the legs, and GB is the hypotenuse. So GA² + AB² = GB² → 10² + AB² = 10² → AB² = 0 → AB = 0, which is impossible. This contradiction indicates a mistake in the correspondence of the similar triangles.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The correspondence of the similar triangles is crucial. Let me re-examine the correspondence.

If Triangle(E,D,B) ~ Triangle(G,A,B), with the correspondence E->G, D->A, B->B, then the sides ED corresponds to GA, DB corresponds to AB, and EB corresponds to GB. But this leads to a contradiction, as shown.

This suggests that the correspondence might be different. Perhaps the correspondence is E->G, D->B, B->A? Or some other order. Let me reconsider the correspondence based on the given CorrespondingSides predicates.

The problem states: CorrespondingSides(Line(E,D), Line(G,B)) and CorrespondingSides(Line(E,B), Line(A,B)). So Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), and Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B). This suggests that the correspondence of the triangles is such that E-D-B ~ G-B-A? Or G-B-A?

Wait, the correspondence of sides: Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), so in Triangle EDB, side ED corresponds to side GB in Triangle GAB. Similarly, Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B), so side EB in Triangle EDB corresponds to side AB in Triangle GAB.

Thus, the correspondence of the triangles is such that:

- Vertex E in Triangle EDB corresponds to Vertex G in Triangle GAB (since ED corresponds to GB, which is from G to B).
- Vertex D in Triangle EDB corresponds to Vertex A in Triangle GAB (since ED corresponds to GB, and EB corresponds to AB; so E->G, D->A, B->B).
Wait, this is confusing. Let me map it properly.

If Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), then the endpoints of Line(E,D) are E and D, which correspond to the endpoints of Line(G,B), which are G and B. So, E corresponds to G, and D corresponds to B. Or E corresponds to B, and D corresponds to G? Depends on the direction.

Similarly, Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B), so the endpoints of Line(E,B) are E and B, which correspond to the endpoints of Line(A,B), which are A and B. So E corresponds to A, and B corresponds to B. Or E corresponds to B, and B corresponds to A.

This is ambiguous without knowing the direction of the correspondence. To resolve this, we need to ensure consistency.

Let me assume that the correspondence is such that E corresponds to G, D corresponds to A, and B corresponds to B. This would mean that Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,A), but the given correspondence is Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B). So this suggests that the correspondence is different.

Alternatively, if Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), then E corresponds to G and D corresponds to B. And Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B), so E corresponds to A and B corresponds to B. This would mean that E corresponds to both G and A, which is impossible unless G and A are the same point, which they aren't.

This suggests that the correspondence is not straightforward, and I might need to re-express the similarity correctly.

Let me try a different approach. Let's denote the similarity ratio between Triangle(E,D,B) and Triangle(G,A,B) as k. So, all sides of Triangle(E,DB) are k times the corresponding sides of Triangle(G,A,B).

Given that Line(E,D) corresponds to Line(G,B), and Line(E,B) corresponds to Line(A,B). So, the sides ED and EB in Triangle EDB correspond to GB and AB in Triangle GAB.

Wait, this would mean that ED corresponds to GB, and EB corresponds to AB. So, the ratio is ED/GB = EB/AB = k.

Given ED = 4, GB = 10, so k = 4/10 = 2/5.

Thus, EB/AB = 2/5 → AB = (5/2) EB.

Now, we also have DC || EB, and DC = 5. Since DC is parallel to EB, and DC is part of Line(D,C), which connects to C. Let's consider the line DC and EB being parallel. If we can find a relation between DC and EB through the triangles.

Let me think about the triangle DBC. Since DC is parallel to EB, and if we can find a relation between DC and EB through some proportional segments.

Let me assume that Line(DB) is a transversal cutting DC and EB. Since DC || EB, the ratio of DC to EB is equal to the ratio of the segments of DB. But since DC starts at D, and EB starts at E, the transversal DB intersects DC at D and EB at B. So the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of DB to itself? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles. If DC || EB, then triangles DBC and EBA might be similar? Let me check.

For triangles DBC and EBA to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal. Since DC || EB, angle at D in triangle DBC is equal to angle at E in triangle EBA (corresponding angles). Also, angle at B in triangle DBC is equal to angle at B in triangle EBA (common angle?). Not sure.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, and if we can show that the triangles are similar, then DC/EB = DB/EB or something like that.

This is getting too vague. Let me try to use the earlier equations, even though they gave AB = 10, and see if that fits with DC = 5.

From the earlier calculation, AB = 10. Then, EB = (2/5) * 10 = 4. So EB = 4. Now, since DC is parallel to EB, and DC = 5, and EB = 4, the ratio of DC to EB is 5/4. This ratio should be equal to the ratio of corresponding sides in some similar triangles.

But where? If we consider the line DC and EB, and the transversal DB, then the ratio of DC to EB would be equal to the ratio of the distances from D to the lines. But since DC starts at D, this ratio would be zero, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where DC and EB are corresponding sides, like in a larger triangle. For example, if we consider triangle DBC and triangle EBA, and if they are similar, then DC/EB = DB/EA = BC/BA.

But without knowing EA or BC, this is challenging.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, and if we consider the line EC, but I don't have information about EC.

At this point, it's clear that the earlier derivation giving AB = 10 is inconsistent with the given DC = 5, suggesting that there's an error in the assumptions. Let me revisit the initial step.

Maybe the correspondence of the similar triangles is different. Let me try
