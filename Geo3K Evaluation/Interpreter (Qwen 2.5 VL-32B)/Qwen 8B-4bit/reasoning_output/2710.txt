MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is about a rectangle WXYZ with some points and angles mentioned. We need to find the measure of angle 5, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the rectangle WXYZ. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles (90 degrees). Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Now, there's a point A where lines WX and YZ intersect. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel, so lines WX and YZ should never meet unless they're extended. But since they do intersect at point A, maybe we're dealing with extensions of the sides?

Wait, the problem says IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)). That means lines WX and YZ intersect at point A. But in a rectangle, sides WX and YZ are opposite sides, so they are parallel. Therefore, two parallel lines shouldn't intersect unless they are the same line, which they aren't here. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the lines are not just the sides but extended? Like, extending the sides until they meet at point A. That makes sense because in a rectangle, the opposite sides are parallel, so their extensions would meet at some point outside the rectangle.

So, point A is the intersection of the extensions of WX and YZ. Now, looking at the other lines: Line(W,A), Line(X,A), Line(Y,A), Line(Z,A). So point A is connected to all four corners of the rectangle. That forms four lines from A to each corner. 

Now, angles mentioned: Angle(1) and Angle(5). Given that MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 30 degrees, and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(5))). So angle 1 and angle 5 have the same measure. The question is to find the measure of angle 5, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. So angle 5 is also 30 degrees? But wait, maybe there's more to it. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem mentions several RightAngles. For example, RightAngle(Angle(W,Y,Z)), which would mean that the angle at Y between WY and YZ is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z)) implies the angle at Y between XY and YZ is a right angle. Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are already right angles. So these are confirming that the figure is indeed a rectangle. However, the presence of point A complicates things.

Let me try to visualize the rectangle WXYZ. Let me sketch mentally: Points W, X, Y, Z forming a rectangle. So, W connected to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z back to W. Then, lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, hence parallel. Their extension meets at point A. So, if I imagine extending WX beyond X and YZ beyond Z, they meet at point A? Or maybe extending WX beyond W and YZ beyond Y? Wait, depends on how the lines are drawn. Since the lines are Line(W,X) and Line(Y,Z), which are the original sides. So Line(W,X) is side WX, and Line(Y,Z) is side YZ. These are parallel, so they don't intersect unless extended. So, to find their intersection, they must be extended beyond their endpoints. For example, extending WX beyond X and YZ beyond Z, or vice versa.

Assuming that point A is formed by extending those sides. Now, connecting A to each of the rectangle's vertices creates lines WA, XA, YA, ZA. So, point A is outside the rectangle, connected to all four corners. This setup likely forms triangles and possibly some triangles with specific angles.

Given that, let's consider triangles involving point A. For instance, triangle WXA, triangle XAY, etc. But perhaps focusing on triangles that involve angle 1 and angle 5.

Looking at the given angles: Angle(1) and Angle(5). The problem states that their measures are equal. Also, there are several right angles mentioned. Let me recall that in such configurations, sometimes vertical angles or corresponding angles come into play.

Since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and line A connects their intersection, then the lines WA and AZ would form transversals. Wait, point A is the intersection of lines WX and YZ. So, considering the lines WA and ZA. Wait, maybe we can look at triangles formed by point A and the rectangle.

Alternatively, since we have a rectangle, and point A is the intersection of the extensions of its opposite sides, this setup resembles a trapezoid or something else. Wait, actually, when you extend the sides of a rectangle, you can form a larger shape, and point A could be part of that.

Another thought: In such cases, the triangles formed may have certain properties. For example, triangle AWX and triangle AYZ might be similar or congruent. Alternatively, considering the diagonals of the rectangle. Wait, but the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other but are not necessarily involved here.

Alternatively, maybe triangle WYA or something similar. Let me try to think of angles around point A. Since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and ZA are transversals, the angles formed at A might relate to the angles of the rectangle.

But how does angle 1 fit in? The problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(5), with measure 30 and equal to each other. Let me check the exact wording: "MeasureOf(Angle(1), 30)" and "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)))". So angle 1 is 30 degrees, and angle 5 is equal to angle 1. Hence, angle 5 is also 30 degrees. But why would that be the case? Is there a reason why angle 5 equals angle 1?

Wait, perhaps angle 1 and angle 5 are vertical angles or alternate interior angles? Or maybe they are base angles of an isosceles triangle?

Alternatively, since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and ZA are transversals, creating angles at A. Suppose angle 1 is one of those angles formed by the transversal. For example, if line WA intersects line WX at W and line YZ at A, then angle at A might be related to the angles of the rectangle.

Alternatively, considering triangle WXY. Wait, but point A is connected to W, X, Y, Z. Let me think of specific triangles. Let's take triangle WAX. Since WA is a line from A to W, and XA is from A to X. Similarly, other triangles.

Alternatively, since WXYZ is a rectangle, the sides WX and YZ are parallel and equal. When extended, they meet at A. So, triangle AWX and triangle AYZ might be similar. Because the sides WX and YZ are parallel, making corresponding angles equal. Thus, the triangles could be similar, leading to certain angle relations.

But how does angle 1 and angle 5 come into play here? Maybe angle 1 is an angle inside one of these triangles, and angle 5 is another angle in a different triangle, but they are equal due to similarity or congruence.

Alternatively, since the problem gives several right angles, maybe the angles at the corners of the rectangle are right angles, and the angles at point A are determined by those.

Wait, let's think about the configuration again. Lines WX and YZ are extended to meet at A. So, point A lies outside the rectangle, forming two pairs of vertical angles. Let me label the angles at point A. When two lines cross, they form vertical angles. So, the angles at A would be vertical angles, which are equal. But angle 1 and angle 5 being equal might refer to those vertical angles.

But the problem states that measure of angle 1 is 30, and measure of angle 5 is equal to that. So if angle 1 and angle 5 are vertical angles, then they are equal, which fits. But then, why is angle 1 given as 30? How does that relate to the rest of the figure?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle formed by the intersection of lines WA and something else. Wait, the problem lists several lines: Line(W,A), Line(X,A), Line(Y,A), Line(Z,A). So point A is connected to all four corners of the rectangle. So, from point A, there are four lines going to each vertex of the rectangle.

This suggests that point A is the center of some sort of star or has symmetrical properties. But since WXYZ is a rectangle, not a square, the distances from A to each corner vary.

Alternatively, think of triangles formed by point A and the rectangle. For instance, triangle WXA, triangle XAY, etc. Each of these triangles might have specific angles.

But without knowing the exact location of A, it's hard to say. However, the fact that lines WX and YZ intersect at A implies that A lies along the extension of those sides. So, depending on which direction the extensions go, the position of A changes.

Let me consider coordinates to model this. Assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place point W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b), forming a rectangle with length a and width b. Then, lines WX is from (0,0) to (a,0), and line YZ is from (a,b) to (0,b). Wait, no—line YZ goes from Y(a,b) to Z(0,b)? No, in a rectangle, the order is W-X-Y-Z-W. So, if W is (0,0), X is (a,0), Y is (a,b), Z is (0,b). Then line YZ is from Y(a,b) to Z(0,b). So, line YZ is horizontal, same as line WX. So lines WX and YZ are both horizontal lines, y=0 and y=b. They are parallel, so they don't intersect unless extended vertically. Wait, but if they are horizontal, they are parallel and never meet. Therefore, their intersection point A must be at infinity, which doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here.

Ah! Wait, maybe I got the labeling wrong. Perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me double-check. In a rectangle WXYZ, the order of the letters matters. Typically, rectangles are labeled in order, so that consecutive letters are adjacent vertices. So W connected to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z back to W. So, if I assign coordinates accordingly, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me reassign coordinates properly. Let me assume that the rectangle is positioned so that lines WX and YZ are not horizontal. Wait, but in standard coordinate system, if W is (0,0), X is (a,0), Y is (a,b), Z is (0,b), then lines WX and YZ are horizontal. But their equations are y=0 and y=b, which are parallel. So, their intersection is impossible unless they are the same line, which they aren't. Hence, my previous assumption leads to a contradiction, implying that my coordinate assignment is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says that lines WX and YZ intersect at point A. Therefore, my coordinate system must be wrong. Maybe the rectangle isn't aligned axis-aligned? Or maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but diagonals? No, the problem defines Line(W,X) as one side, and Line(Y,Z) as another side. Wait, perhaps the rectangle is rotated? Or perhaps the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but other lines?

Wait, the problem defines Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), which usually implies that the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, in that case, lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, hence parallel. Therefore, their intersection at point A implies that they are not parallel, which contradicts the definition of a rectangle. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the given predicates.

Wait, perhaps the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but something else? Wait, the problem states:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)"

Which are the four sides of the rectangle. So, lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, hence parallel. Therefore, they cannot intersect unless extended. So, their intersection at point A implies that they were extended beyond their endpoints to meet at A. So, in that case, point A is outside the rectangle, formed by extending the sides WX and YZ until they meet.

In that case, assigning coordinates correctly. Let me try again. Let's define the rectangle with W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Then, line WX is from (0,0) to (a,0), and line YZ is from (a,b) to (0,b). To find their intersection, we need to extend these lines. Wait, line WX is the x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0). Line YZ is the horizontal line from (a,b) to (0,b), which is the same as y = b. These are parallel, so they won't meet unless extended. Wait, but if I extend line WX beyond X and line YZ beyond Z, then line WX extends infinitely to the right, while line YZ extends infinitely to the left. These lines are still parallel, so they never meet. Hence, this suggests that my coordinate system is causing confusion.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is not a standard axis-aligned rectangle? Maybe it's rotated. Suppose the rectangle is rotated so that sides WX and YZ are not horizontal. For example, imagine a rectangle tilted so that sides WX and YZ are not parallel to the axes. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are always parallel. So regardless of rotation, sides WX and YZ remain parallel. Hence, their extensions would never meet unless the rectangle is degenerate, which it's not.

This indicates a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement. However, since the problem states that the intersection exists, there must be a different interpretation. Wait, perhaps the lines are not the sides but something else? Let me read the problem again.

The problem includes:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Line(W,A)
Line(X,A)
Line(Y,A)
Line(Z,A)"

So, lines WA, XA, YA, ZA connect point A to all four corners. And the lines WX and YZ are the sides of the rectangle. So, lines WX and YZ intersect at point A. Which, as per the earlier logic, requires that these lines are not parallel. But in a rectangle, they are parallel. Hence, contradiction. Unless... Wait, unless the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but other lines?

Wait, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but other lines. Let me check the problem again. It starts with Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), which typically implies that W, X, Y, Z are the vertices in order, forming the rectangle. Hence, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, lines WX and YZ are opposite sides, hence parallel. Therefore, their intersection at point A implies that they are not parallel, which is impossible. This suggests either a misinterpretation or a trick in the problem.

Wait, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not straight lines? No, the problem says Line(W,X), so they are straight lines. Hence, contradiction arises. This suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to segments rather than infinite lines? But the term "Line(W,X)" usually denotes an infinite line, not just the segment between W and X. If it refers to the segment, then lines WX and YZ are segments that do not intersect, hence no intersection point. But the problem says they do intersect at point A. Therefore, this suggests that the problem uses "Line" to mean the infinite line, not the segment. Hence, even though the sides are parallel, their infinite lines intersect at point A. But how?

Wait, in Euclidean geometry, two distinct parallel lines do not intersect. So, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Wait, unless the rectangle is not convex? Or the lines are not the sides but diagonals?

Wait, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides but the diagonals? If that's the case, then they would intersect at the center of the rectangle. But the problem states that the Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z) implies sides, not diagonals. But if the problem incorrectly labels them as diagonals, then lines WX and YZ would intersect at the center. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the intended lines are not WX and YZ but other pairs. For example, maybe Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y)? That would make sense as diagonals. But without knowing, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, but that's unlikely given the context.

Hmm, this is confusing. But since the problem is presented as solvable, I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a way for lines WX and YZ to intersect at point A. Given that, perhaps the rectangle is degenerate or the lines are not the sides but something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is folded or overlapped in a way that allows lines WX and YZ to intersect. But that seems too vague.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the lines WX and YZ are not the sides of the rectangle but other lines passing through the rectangle. For example, line WX could be a diagonal, and line YZ another diagonal. But in that case, the rectangle's diagonals intersect at the center. But the problem specifies Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z), which usually means the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, diagonals would be WY and XZ.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mislabeling, and the lines in question are not WX and YZ but other lines. For example, maybe Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y)? Those would be diagonals intersecting at the center. If that's the case, then point A is the center of the rectangle. But the problem says IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A)), which would imply lines WX and YZ intersect at A. So unless lines WX and YZ are not the sides but diagonals, which would make sense. Let me try this approach.

Assume that lines WX and YZ are diagonals of the rectangle. So, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Hence, their intersection point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. In this case, point A is the center of the rectangle. Now, with this assumption, the rest of the problem makes sense.

So, assuming that lines WX and YZ are the diagonals, which intersect at point A. Then, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, so A is the midpoint. Now, connecting A to all four vertices W, X, Y, Z would create lines from the center to each vertex. 

Now, considering angles at point A. For example, angle between lines AW and AX, or angle between AX and AY, etc. But how does this relate to the given angles 1 and 5?

The problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(5), with measure 1 being 30 degrees, and they are equal. Let me think about the angles formed at point A. Since A is the intersection of diagonals, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and form vertical angles. But since the rectangle's diagonals are equal and bisect each other, the angles at A would depend on the rectangle's aspect ratio.

However, in a general rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. But the problem mentions several right angles, like RightAngle(Angle(W,Y,Z)), which is the angle at Y between WY and YZ. Wait, if WY is a diagonal and YZ is a side, then that angle would be between the diagonal and the side. In a rectangle, this angle is not necessarily a right angle unless it's a square. Wait, but the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(W,Y,Z)), so this angle is 90 degrees. Let me verify this.

If WY is a diagonal and YZ is a side, then angle at Y between WY and YZ. In a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. Let's consider coordinates again. Let me define W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Diagonal WY would be from (0,0) to (a,b), and side YZ is from (a,b) to (0,b). The angle at Y between WY and YZ is the angle between vector YW and YZ. Vector YW is from Y to W: (-a, -b). Vector YZ is from Y to Z: (-a, 0). The angle between vectors (-a,-b) and (-a,0). The dot product is (-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a². The magnitude of first vector is sqrt(a² + b²), second vector is a. So cos(theta) = a² / [sqrt(a² + b²)*a] = a / sqrt(a² + b²). This is not necessarily 90 degrees unless a=0 or b=0, which would collapse the rectangle. Hence, the problem's assertion that Angle(W,Y,Z) is a right angle seems invalid unless it's a square. But the problem states it is a right angle, implying that the rectangle is a square? But then, why mention it as a rectangle?

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the labeling. Perhaps the lines mentioned are not the diagonals but the sides. But earlier, that led to a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not sides but other lines, and the right angles are elsewhere.

Given the confusion arising from the initial assumptions, perhaps I should focus on the given angles and the relationships between them instead of trying to reconcile the conflicting geometrical conditions.

The problem states that several angles are right angles, including Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(X,Y,Z), Angle(X,W,Z), and Angle(W,X,Y). Wait, let's parse these:

- Angle(W,Y,Z): this is the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z. In a rectangle, this would be the angle at Y between sides WY and YZ. As discussed earlier, this is not necessarily a right angle unless the rectangle is a square. But the problem says it is a right angle. Similarly for Angle(X,Y,Z): the angle at Y between X, Y, Z. Wait, if X, Y, Z are consecutive vertices, then this would be the internal angle at Y, which in a rectangle is 90 degrees. Ah! Here's the key.

Wait, if the angle is at Y between X, Y, Z, then it's the internal angle of the rectangle at Y, which is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the internal angle at Y, which is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(X,W,Z) is the angle at W between X, W, Z. Wait, that would be the angle at W between sides WX and WZ. In a rectangle, this is also a right angle. And Angle(W,X,Y) is the angle at X between W, X, Y, which is also a right angle. So these right angles confirm that WXYZ is a rectangle.

Therefore, the earlier confusion about lines WX and YZ intersecting at A must be resolved. Let me revisit this.

Lines WX and YZ are sides of the rectangle, hence parallel. But the problem says they intersect at point A. This implies that they are not parallel, which contradicts the rectangle's property. Hence, the only way this makes sense is if lines WX and YZ are not the sides but other lines. Wait, perhaps the lines are not the sides but the extensions of the sides? For example, line WX is extended beyond W and X, and line YZ is extended beyond Y and Z, meeting at point A. 

Yes! This is the crux. The lines WX and YZ are not the sides themselves but their extensions. So, line WX extends beyond W and X, and line YZ extends beyond Y and Z, and these extended lines meet at point A. This is possible because the sides are parallel, but their extensions meet at a point outside the rectangle.

For example, in a rectangle, if you extend the sides WX and YZ beyond their ends, they will meet at a point A. This forms a larger structure with point A outside the rectangle.

Now, with this corrected understanding, let's proceed.

So, point A is the intersection of the extensions of sides WX and YZ. From point A, lines are drawn to all four vertices W, X, Y, Z. This forms four lines from A to each vertex, creating various triangles and angles.

Now, the given angles are Angle(1) and Angle(5), with Angle(1) measuring 30 degrees, and Angle(5) equal to it. We need to find the measure of Angle(5).

To find this, we need to identify what these angles represent. Likely, they are angles formed at point A or within the triangles created by connecting A to the rectangle's vertices.

Let me consider the triangles formed. For instance, triangle AWX, triangle AYZ, etc. Since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and point A is their intersection, the triangles formed might have certain properties.

Consider triangle AWX: it has vertices at A, W, X. Similarly, triangle AYZ has vertices at A, Y, Z. Since WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and ZA are transversals, there might be similar triangles or proportional sides.

Also, since the rectangle has right angles at each vertex, the angles at W, X, Y, Z are 90 degrees.

Now, let's examine the angles at point A. When two lines intersect, they form vertical angles. So, the angles at A formed by lines WA, XA, YA, ZA would have certain relationships.

But how do Angle(1) and Angle(5) fit in? The problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(1), 30) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(5))). So, Angle(1) and Angle(5) are equal, and we know Angle(1) is 30 degrees. So, Angle(5) is also 30 degrees. But why would that be the case?

Perhaps Angle(1) and Angle(5) are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by the transversal lines.

Let me try to visualize. Since lines WX and YZ are parallel, and line WA is a transversal cutting them. Similarly, line ZA is another transversal. The angles formed at A could be related to the angles inside the rectangle.

For example, consider the angle between WA and WX at point W. Since WX is a side of the rectangle, and WA extends from W to A, this angle would be part of triangle AWX. Similarly, at point A, the angle between WA and XA would be Angle(1) or Angle(5).

Alternatively, Angle(1) could be an angle inside one of the triangles formed by point A and the rectangle's vertices. Let's suppose that Angle(1) is an angle in triangle AWX, and Angle(5) is an angle in another triangle, and they are equal due to some symmetry or proportionality.

Alternatively, since the lines WX and YZ are parallel, and lines WA and ZA are transversals, the angles formed at A might be related via the properties of parallel lines.

Let me attempt to calculate the angles using triangle properties. Assume that the rectangle has length a and height b. Extend WX beyond X to meet the extension of YZ at point A. Let me use coordinates again, carefully.

Let me set up coordinates with W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Line WX is from (0,0) to (a,0), and line YZ is from (a,b) to (0,b). To find their intersection, I need to extend these lines. Line WX is the x-axis (y=0). Line YZ is the line from (a,b) to (0,b), which is the horizontal line y=b. These are parallel, so they don't intersect. Wait, this brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

Ah! Wait, if I extend line WX beyond W and line YZ beyond Z, they would be parallel and not meet. But if I extend line WX beyond X and line YZ beyond Y, they would still be parallel. Hence, no intersection. This suggests that there's a flaw in the problem's setup, but since it's presented as solvable, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the lines are not WX and YZ but other lines. Let me check the problem again. It says:

"Line(W,X)
Line(X,Y)
Line(Y,Z)
Line(Z,W)
Line(W,A)
Line(X,A)
Line(Y,A)
Line(Z,A)
Angle(1)
Angle(5)
MeasureOf(Angle(1), 30)
RightAngle(Angle(W,Y,Z))
RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z))
RightAngle(Angle(X,W,Z))
RightAngle(Angle(W,X,Y))
IntersectionOf(Line(W,X), Line(Y,Z), Point(A))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(5)))"

So, the lines WX and YZ are the ones intersecting at A. But in a rectangle, they are parallel, hence no intersection. This suggests that the problem might have a typo, and the intended lines are WX and ZY, which would be the same as YZ, or perhaps other lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not WX and YZ but WX and ZY? No, ZY is the same as YZ. Alternatively, maybe it's Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y)? Let me assume that it's a typo and that the lines should be Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y), which are the diagonals of the rectangle. In that case, they intersect at the center point A. This would resolve the intersection issue.

Assuming that, let's proceed. So, lines WZ and XY are the diagonals of the rectangle, intersecting at point A. In this case, A is the center of the rectangle. Connecting A to all four vertices creates lines from the center to the vertices. Now, the angles at point A would be formed by these lines.

In this scenario, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal. The angle between the diagonals depends on the rectangle's aspect ratio. However, the problem mentions several right angles, like Angle(W,Y,Z), which in this case would be the angle at Y between W, Y, Z. Wait, if WZ is a diagonal, then Y is a vertex, and the angle at Y between WY and YZ would involve the diagonal WY and side YZ. In this case, since WY is a diagonal and YZ is a side, the angle at Y is between the diagonal and the side. This angle is not necessarily a right angle unless the rectangle is a square.

But the problem states that Angle(W,Y,Z) is a right angle, implying that this angle is 90 degrees. This would only happen if the diagonal WY is perpendicular to the side YZ, which occurs only if the rectangle is a square. Hence, this suggests that the rectangle is a square. But the problem calls it a rectangle, not necessarily a square. This seems contradictory.

But given that the problem states several right angles, including Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(X,Y,Z), Angle(X,W,Z), and Angle(W,X,Y), which are all internal angles of the rectangle at each vertex, which are all right angles by definition. Hence, this confirms that WXYZ is a rectangle, and the other angles mentioned (like Angle(W,Y,Z)) are not internal angles but other angles.

Wait, Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z. If Y is a vertex, and WY and YZ are two lines from Y. In a rectangle, WY would be a diagonal from Y to W, and YZ is a side from Y to Z. The angle between diagonal WY and side YZ at Y is not a right angle unless it's a square. But the problem states it is a right angle, so this suggests that the rectangle is a square. Hence, all angles at the vertices are right angles, and the diagonals are perpendicular to the sides, which is true only in a square. Hence, this implies the rectangle is a square.

If that's the case, then the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, in a square, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. But in a general rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Hence, this reinforces that the rectangle is a square.

Assuming that the rectangle is a square, then the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. Now, point A is the intersection of the diagonals. Connecting A to all four vertices creates lines from the center to each vertex, forming four right angles at A. But the problem mentions angles 1 and 5, which are equal to 30 degrees. This suggests that the angles in question are not the angles between the diagonals but other angles formed by the connections from A to the vertices.

Wait, if A is the center of the square, then lines WA, XA, YA, ZA are all radii to the vertices. In a square, these lines are symmetric. However, if we consider triangles formed by these lines, such as triangle WAX, it would be an isoceles triangle with WA and XA as equal-length sides (since it's a square). The angles at A would depend on the square's properties.

But how does this relate to angles 1 and 5? Let me consider that Angle(1) is one of the angles formed at point A. For example, in triangle WAX, the angle at A could be Angle(1). If the square has side length s, then the diagonals are s√2, and the distance from center A to any vertex is s√2/2. In triangle WAX, sides WA and XA are both s√2/2, and the base WX is s. Using the Law of Cosines, the angle at A can be calculated.

Let me compute it. In triangle WAX, sides WA = XA = s√2/2, and WX = s. Applying the Law of Cosines:

WX² = WA² + XA² - 2*WA*XA*cos(angle at A)

s² = (s²/2) + (s²/2) - 2*(s²/2)*cos(angle)

s² = s² - s² * cos(angle)

Subtract s² from both sides: 0 = -s² * cos(angle) → cos(angle) = 0 → angle = 90 degrees.

So, the angle at A in triangle WAX is 90 degrees. But this contradicts the given that Angle(1) is 30 degrees. Hence, this suggests that the angle in question is not in this triangle.

Maybe Angle(1) is an angle in another triangle. Let's consider triangle WAZ. If A is the center, then WA and ZA are both radii, and WZ is a side of the square. Wait, but WZ is a side, so length s. Again, applying the Law of Cosines would give the angle at A as 90 degrees. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe Angle(1) is an angle formed by lines from A to other points. For example, if we consider triangle AXY, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(1) is not inside the square but at point A formed by other lines. For instance, if lines from A to W, X, Y, Z create various angles. In a square, the lines from center to vertices are along the diagonals, so the angles between these lines would be 90 degrees. But again, this doesn't align with the given 30 degrees.

This suggests that the initial assumption that the lines intersect at the diagonals is incorrect. Hence, returning to the original problem, the only way for lines WX and YZ to intersect at A is if they are not sides of the rectangle but other lines. Perhaps the lines are not the sides but the lines containing the sides, extended.

But in that case, as previously noted, lines WX and YZ are parallel, so they don't intersect. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, but that's unlikely given the context.

At this point, I realize I might need to accept that there's a miscommunication in the problem's setup, but since it's presented as solvable, I'll proceed under the assumption that lines WX and YZ are not the sides but the diagonals, and the rectangle is a square. Even though this introduces inconsistencies, it allows proceeding.

Assuming the rectangle is a square, and lines WX and YZ are diagonals intersecting at A (the center). Now, connecting A to all four vertices creates lines from the center to each vertex. Now, the angles at point A would be between these lines. In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the angle between WA and XA would be 90 degrees. But the problem states that Angle(1) is 30 degrees, so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(1) is an angle formed by one of the lines from A to a vertex and a side. For example, in triangle WAX, the angle at W is 90 degrees, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, consider that point A is not the center but somewhere else. Suppose the lines WX and YZ are extended to meet at A, forming a triangle with the rectangle. Let me try this approach again.

Let me define the rectangle WXYZ with W at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Extend line WX beyond X and line YZ beyond Z. These lines are both horizontal, so they are parallel and never meet. Hence, no intersection. Extend line WX beyond W and line YZ beyond Y. Still parallel. Extend line WX beyond X and line YZ beyond Y. Still parallel. Hence, no intersection. This suggests that the lines cannot intersect, hence the problem is flawed.

Given this impasse, perhaps the problem intends for lines WX and YZ to be non-parallel, implying that the figure is not a rectangle but another quadrilateral. But the problem explicitly states it's a rectangle. This is very confusing.

Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradiction, I'll proceed with the assumption that the lines WX and YZ are the diagonals intersecting at A, and the rectangle is a square, despite the earlier contradictions. Under this assumption, and given that Angle(1) and Angle(5) are equal and measure 30 degrees, I'll try to derive the relationship.

If the rectangle is a square, and lines WX and YZ are diagonals intersecting at A, then the diagonals are perpendicular, forming 90-degree angles at A. But the problem states Angle(1) is 30 degrees, which doesn't fit. Hence, this is not the case.

Another possibility: the angles 1 and 5 are not at point A but elsewhere. For example, in the triangles formed by connecting A to the vertices. Let's say Angle(1) is an angle in triangle AWX, and Angle(5) is an angle in another triangle, and they are equal due to some symmetry.

Assuming that, and given that Angle(1) is 30 degrees, then Angle(5) is also 30 degrees. Hence, the answer is B. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if the lines WX and YZ are extended to meet at A, forming a triangle with the rectangle, and using the properties of parallel lines and transversals, the angles at A could be related to the angles of the rectangle. For example, if the lines WX and YZ are parallel, and line WA is a transversal, then the angles formed at A could be supplementary to the angles of the rectangle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll conclude that since Angle(1) and Angle(5) are equal, and Angle(1) is 30 degrees, Angle(5) must also be 30 degrees. Hence, the answer is B.
