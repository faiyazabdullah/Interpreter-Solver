MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have points A, B, C, D, F, G. Circle B is mentioned, so B is the center of the circle. AD and CG are diameters of circle B. That means points A and D are endpoints of one diameter, and C and G are endpoints of another diameter. So, since they're diameters, the lines AD and CG pass through the center B. 

Now, looking at the angles. There's Angle(C, B, D) which measures 55 degrees, and Angle(F, B, G) measures 35 degrees. Also, the arcs CD and FG measure 55 and 35 respectively. Wait, but arcs are related to central angles. Since AD and CG are diameters, the arc from A to D should be 180 degrees because it's a semicircle. Similarly, arc from C to G is also 180 degrees. 

But there's also Arc(C,D) measuring 55 degrees. Hmm, wait, if CD is an arc, but since C and D are points on the circle, maybe that's part of another arc? Let me think. Since AD is a diameter, point D is directly opposite A. Similarly, CG is a diameter, so G is opposite C. But how do these points relate?

Let me sketch mentally. Points A and D are ends of a diameter. Points C and G are ends of another diameter. So, the circle has two diameters AD and CG intersecting at center B. Therefore, the points A, C, D, G are all on the circumference. Now, the angles mentioned: Angle(C,B,D) is formed by points C, B, D. Since B is the center, CB and DB are radii. So angle CBD is formed at the center between points C and D. Similarly, angle FBG is at the center between F and G. Wait, but where is point F?

Wait, the problem mentions point F. The arc FG measures 35 degrees. So F is another point on the circle. But how does it fit in? Maybe F is connected to some other points? Or perhaps there's more structure here.

But the main goal is to find the measure of arc AG. The question asks for m∠AG, which I assume refers to the measure of arc AG. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the user wrote "Find m ∠AG." Wait, no—wait, the original question says "Find m \widehat{AG}." So that's the measure of arc AG. So we need to find the arc length between points A and G on the circle.

So first, let's recall that in a circle, the measure of an arc corresponds to the central angle subtended by that arc. For example, arc CD measures 55°, which would mean that the central angle COD (if O were the center) is 55°, but in our case, the center is B. So arc CD is 55°, so the central angle for arc CD is angle CBD, which is given as 55°, matching the predicate. Similarly, arc FG is 35°, so the central angle FBG is 35°, which matches the given angle measure.

Now, since AD and CG are diameters, each of those arcs AD and CG is 180°, as they span half the circle. So arc AD = 180°, arc CG = 180°. Now, we need to figure out arc AG. To find that, perhaps we can consider the positions of points A, G relative to each other.

Since AD is a diameter, starting at A going through B to D. CG is another diameter, starting at C through B to G. So points C and G are on opposite sides of B. Now, the position of point F is unclear yet. However, arc FG is 35°, so the central angle for that arc is 35°, which is angle FBG. So point F is somewhere on the circle such that moving from F to G along the arc is 35°, meaning that the arc from F to G is 35°, hence the central angle is 35°.

But how do these points relate to each other? Let me try to visualize or map out the positions.

First, let's note that since AD and CG are diameters, they cross at the center B. So points A and D are on opposite ends of the circle, and points C and G are on opposite ends. Depending on how these diameters are placed, the positions of points A, C, D, G vary. However, without loss of generality, we can assign coordinates to make this easier.

Alternatively, think about the circle divided by diameters AD and CG. These two diameters divide the circle into four arcs. But since each diameter is 180°, depending on the angle between them, the arcs will split accordingly.

Wait, the angle between diameters AD and CG would affect the arcs. Let me think: the angle between AD and CG at the center B. Since AD is one diameter, and CG is another, the angle between them would be determined by the positions of C and D.

Wait, but the given angles are angle CBD (which is 55°) and angle FBG (35°). Let me see. Angle CBD is the angle at center B between points C and D. Since BD is part of diameter AD, and BC is part of diameter CG. Wait, if BD is a radius (since AD is a diameter), and BC is a radius (since CG is a diameter). So angle CBD is the angle between radii BC and BD. Which would correspond to the arc CD. And since arc CD is given as 55°, that's consistent. Similarly, arc FG is 35°, so angle FBG is 35°, which is the angle between radii BF and BG, corresponding to arc FG.

But how does this help us find arc AG? Let me think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs should add up to 360°. Let me try to break down the circle into arcs.

We know arc CD is 55°, arc FG is 35°, arc AD is 180°, arc CG is 180°. But these arcs may overlap or not. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Since AD and CG are diameters, they split the circle into four arcs. Let me consider that. Each diameter divides the circle into two semicircles. When two diameters intersect at the center, they form four arcs. Let me denote the arcs between the intersection points.

Suppose we have diameters AD and CG. Then, starting from point A, going around the circle, passing through D, then through C and G? Not sure. Alternatively, since AD and CG are two diameters, the arcs between their endpoints depend on the angle between the diameters.

For instance, if the angle between diameters AD and CG is θ, then the arcs between their endpoints would be θ and 180°−θ? Not quite. Let me think again. Suppose the angle between the two diameters at the center is φ. Then, the arcs between the endpoints would be φ and 180°−φ? No, that depends on how they are arranged.

Alternatively, imagine the two diameters AD and CG forming an angle at the center B. Let's say angle between BA and BC is α. Then, the arcs between A and C would be α, and between C and D... Wait, maybe not. This seems confusing without a diagram.

Alternatively, since arc CD is 55°, which is the arc between points C and D. Since C is on diameter CG (so G is the opposite end), and D is on diameter AD. So, the arc from C to D is 55°, which implies that the central angle for that arc is 55°, i.e., angle CBD is 55°, which matches the given data. So, if we look at the angle between BC and BD, which is 55°, then that tells us the arc CD is 55°, as given.

Similarly, arc FG is 35°, so angle FBG is 35°, implying that the arc FG is 35°, which is the central angle between F and G.

Now, to find arc AG. Let's think about the positions of points A and G. Point A is one end of diameter AD, and G is the other end of diameter CG. How far apart are A and G along the circle?

To find arc AG, we need to find the measure of the arc from A to G. Let's consider the entire circle and how the existing arcs contribute.

Let me attempt to compute the total degrees accounted for by the given arcs and see what remains.

We know:

- Arc CD = 55°
- Arc FG = 35°
- Arc AD = 180° (as it's a diameter)
- Arc CG = 180° (also a diameter)

However, these arcs might overlap or share parts. For example, arc CD is part of the circle from C to D, while arc AD spans from A to D. But how do these arcs interact?

Perhaps it's better to consider the circle divided by the diameters AD and CG. Let me try to imagine the circle with diameters AD and CG crossing at B. Let me label the points:

- A and D are endpoints of one diameter.
- C and G are endpoints of another diameter.

So, points A, C, D, G are all on the circle. The angle between diameters AD and CG is determined by the positions of C and D. Since arc CD is 55°, which is the arc from C to D, so the central angle for that arc is 55°, which is angle CBD. Therefore, the angle between BC and BD is 55°, which means that the angle between diameters AD and CG is 55°, because BC is part of diameter CG, and BD is part of diameter AD.

Therefore, the angle between diameters AD and CG is 55°, which splits the circle into four arcs. Let me think: when two diameters intersect at the center, they form four arcs. The sum of all arcs is 360°. The arcs between A and C, C and D, D and G, and G and A? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me clarify.

Actually, the two diameters divide the circle into four arcs. Each pair of adjacent points (from the diameters) forms an arc. For example, if diameters AD and CG intersect at B, then the arcs between A and C, C and D, D and G, and G and A. Wait, but depending on the direction.

But since arc CD is 55°, which is between C and D. Then, arc from D to G would be something, arc from G to A, and arc from A to C. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, considering the full circle, the total degrees would be the sum of all arcs. Let me try to calculate the arcs:

Starting from point A, moving clockwise around the circle:

- From A to C: ?
- From C to D: 55°
- From D to G: ?
- From G back to A: ?

But we also know that arc CG is 180°, which is from C to G. Since CG is a diameter, so arc CG is 180°, which would imply that from C to G is 180°, which includes the arc from C to D (55°) plus arc from D to G. Therefore, arc from D to G is 180° - 55° = 125°. 

Then, from G back to A, we need to find that arc. But we also know that arc AD is 180°, which is from A to D. So from A to D is 180°, which would consist of arc from A to G plus arc from G to D. Wait, but earlier we found arc from D to G is 125°, so arc from G to D is 125°, which would mean arc from A to G is 180° minus arc from G to D. Wait, no. Let me rephrase.

Arc AD is from A to D, which is 180°. If we go from A to D via the other side (the long way around), that would be 180°, but the shorter arc is also 180°. However, if we have arc from D to G being 125°, then arc from G to D is 125°, so the arc from A to G would be arc from A to D (180°) minus arc from D to G (125°)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing directions.

Let me think again. The arc from C to D is 55°, and arc from C to G is 180°, so the arc from D to G is 180° - 55° = 125°, as previously thought. Now, from point G, going back to A, what is the arc? Well, the entire circle is 360°, so the sum of arcs CD (55°), DG (125°), GA (unknown), and AC (unknown) equals 360°. But we also know that arc from A to D is 180°, which could be composed of arc AG + arc GD. Wait, arc from A to D via G would be AG + GD. But GD is 125°, so AG = AD - GD = 180° - 125° = 55°? Wait, that would suggest arc AG is 55°, but that's conflicting with the answer choices unless 55 is an option. But let's check.

Wait, hold on. If arc from A to D is 180°, and arc from D to G is 125°, then the arc from A to G would be arc from A to D minus arc from D to G? No, that would be if we take the arc from A to G through D. But that depends on the direction. Let me think carefully.

Imagine the circle with points A and D as endpoints of a diameter. Then, from D, moving along the arc towards G (which is 125°), so from D to G is 125°. Then, to get from A to G, you can either go the short way around the circle or the long way. The arc from A to G could be either the minor arc or major arc. But since we want the measure of arc AG, it's ambiguous unless specified. However, in the context of the problem, given that arc FG is 35°, which is likely a minor arc, and others like arc CD is 55°, which is also a minor arc. So probably arc AG is the smaller arc between A and G.

But to find that, let's use the fact that the total circumference is 360°. We have arc CD = 55°, arc DG = 125°, arc from G to A (let's call it x), and arc from A to C (call it y). Then, 55 + 125 + x + y = 360 → x + y = 180°. Additionally, since arc from C to G is 180°, which is arc CG. Arc CG can also be broken into arc CD (55°) + arc DG (125°) = 180°, which checks out. Now, arc from A to C (y) and arc from A to G (x) must satisfy something else. 

But how else can we find x or y? Perhaps using other given information. The problem also mentions arc FG = 35°, which is the arc from F to G. Where is point F located? The arc FG is 35°, so point F is somewhere on the circle such that the arc from F to G is 35°. But we don't have much info about point F otherwise. However, maybe point F relates to other points?

Alternatively, since angle FBG is 35°, which is the central angle for arc FG. So point F is positioned such that the central angle between F and G is 35°, meaning that arc FG is 35°, which we already knew. But how does this help us with arc AG?

Perhaps there's another relationship. Let me think about the positions of all points. Since AD and CG are diameters, and we've considered arcs between C-D (55°), D-G (125°), then arc from G to A is x, and arc from A to C is y. Also, since arc from A to D is 180°, which is arc from A to D via the other side. If we consider the arc from A to D via G, that would be arc AG + arc GD = x + 125° = 180°, so x = 180° - 125° = 55°. Therefore, arc AG is 55°, which would be answer D. But wait, answer choice D is 55, which is one of the options. But wait, the given answer choices are A.35, B.40, C.45, D.55. So according to this, answer D would be correct. But wait, that conflicts with some other thoughts.

Wait, but why did I assume that arc from A to D via G is 180°? Because AD is a diameter, so the arc from A to D is 180°, regardless of the path taken. So if we take the path from A to G to D, then that arc would be AG + GD = x + 125° = 180°, leading to x=55°, which is arc AG. Hence, the measure of arc AG is 55°, so answer D. However, let me check if there's another consideration.

But wait, there's also arc FG = 35°, which is given. Maybe point F is involved in determining the position of G? For example, if we consider the arc from F to G is 35°, then point F is located 35° away from G along the circle. But how does that affect arc AG?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to find arc AG by considering other angles. For example, angle at B involving points A and G. But since B is the center, angle ABG would be the central angle for arc AG. Wait, but we don't have any given angles involving A and G. Unless there's another angle given.

Wait, the problem gives angle(F, B, G) = 35°, which is the central angle for arc FG. And angle(C, B, D) = 55°, which is the central angle for arc CD. Are there any other angles mentioned? The problem mentions angle(CBD)=55°, angle(FBG)=35°, but no other angles. 

So if arc AG is 55°, then that would be answer D. However, let me double-check my reasoning.

Another approach: the total of all arcs around the circle is 360°. We have arc CD=55°, arc FG=35°, and the two diameters give arcs AD=180°, CG=180°. However, these arcs might overlap. For example, arc CG is from C to G, which is 180°, and arc CD is from C to D (55°), so arc DG is 180° - 55° = 125°, as before. Then, arc from D to G is 125°, and arc from G to A is x. Also, arc from A to D is 180°, so arc from A to D can be split into arc AG + arc GD. Thus, arc AG = arc AD - arc GD = 180° - 125° = 55°, confirming previous conclusion. So arc AG is 55°, which would be answer D.

But wait, the answer choices include D.55, so that would be correct. But why isn't there an alternative explanation? Let me think again. Is there a possibility that arc AG is not the minor arc but the major arc? For example, if the arc AG was larger than 180°, then its measure would be different. But since arc GD is 125°, and arc AG is 55°, then the major arc AG would be 360° - 55° = 305°, which is unlikely given the other arcs. Moreover, since the problem didn't specify major or minor arc, but typically, in such problems, unless stated otherwise, the arc measure refers to the minor arc. So 55° is the correct measure.

But wait, the answer choices include 55 as option D. So according to this, the answer is D. But wait, let me check once more. Could there be another way to get arc AG?

Alternatively, think about the positions of points. Since AD and CG are diameters, and angle CBD is 55°, which is the central angle between C and D. So if we imagine the circle with center B, and diameters AD and CG intersecting at B. Then, the angle between diameters AD and CG is 55°, since angle CBD is 55°. Therefore, the angle between diameters AD and CG is 55°, which would split the circle into four arcs. The arcs between A and C, C and D (55°), D and G, and G and A. The arcs between A and C and between D and G would depend on the angle between the diameters.

Wait, if the angle between diameters AD and CG is 55°, then the arc between A and C would be 55°, and the arc between D and G would be 180° - 55° = 125°, but that might not be accurate. Wait, no. The angle between two diameters at the center is equal to the arc between their endpoints. For example, if two diameters AD and CG meet at angle θ at the center, then the arc between A and C would be θ, and the arc between D and G would be 180° - θ? Not necessarily. It depends on the arrangement.

Alternatively, the angle between diameters AD and CG is equal to the arc between A and C or between D and G. For instance, if you have two diameters intersecting at angle θ, then the arcs between their endpoints would be θ and 180° - θ. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of specific examples.

If two diameters are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90°, and the arcs between their endpoints would be 90° and 270°, but that's not helpful. Actually, when two diameters intersect at angle θ, the arcs between their endpoints would be θ and 180° - θ? No, that depends on which arcs you're talking about. The angle between two diameters is the same as the arc between their endpoints. For example, if two diameters form an angle of 55° at the center, then the arc between the endpoints of those diameters would be 55°, and the opposite arc would be 360° - 55° = 305°, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Earlier calculation suggested arc AG is 55°, which leads to answer D. But let me verify once more.

From point D, moving to G is 125°, as arc DG is 125°. From A to D is 180°, so arc AG is 180° - 125° = 55°. Yes, that still holds. Therefore, arc AG is 55°, answer D.

But why is there an option for 55? Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let me check the initial problem again. The problem states that arc CD is 55°, arc FG is 35°, arc AD and CG are 180°. So, the arc CD is between C and D, which is 55°, and arc FG is 35°. Now, the arc AG is what we're trying to find. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another method using angles. For example, if we consider the positions of points and the angles given. But I don't see another way. Another idea: since angle at B for arc FG is 35°, so point F is located such that the arc from F to G is 35°, so if we can find where F is, maybe we can connect it to other points. However, without more information about F, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arc AG and the angles given. For instance, if we can find the angle at B between points A and G, which would be the central angle for arc AG. But how?

If we can find the angle between BA and BG, that would be the central angle for arc AG. Let me think: BA is part of diameter AD, and BG is part of diameter CG. The angle between BA and BG is the angle between diameters AD and CG at point B. Earlier, we said that angle between diameters AD and CG is equal to the arc CD, which is 55°, because angle CBD is 55°. Wait, angle CBD is between BC and BD. So, if we consider BA and BG, which are the other ends of the diameters, the angle between BA and BG would be supplementary to angle CBD? Let me explain.

At the center B, we have diameters AD and CG. So, BA is pointing in the direction from B to A, and BG is pointing in the direction from B to G. The angle between BA and BG would depend on the angle between diameters AD and CG. Since angle CBD is 55°, which is between BC and BD. If we imagine rotating from BA to BC to BD to BG, the angle between BA and BG would be the sum of certain angles. 

Alternatively, since AD and CG are diameters, the angle between BA and BC would be the same as the angle between DA and DC? Not sure. Let me try to find the angle between BA and BG.

Assume that the angle between diameters AD and CG is θ. Then, the angle between BA and BG would be θ or 180° - θ, depending on direction. But earlier, we had angle CBD = 55°, which is the angle between BC and BD. Since BC is part of CG (diameter), and BD is part of AD (diameter). So, if we consider the angle between BA and BC, that would be the angle between BA and BC. But since BA is opposite to BD (because AD is a diameter), so BA and BD are in opposite directions. So, the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - angle CBD. Wait, if angle CBD is 55°, then the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - 55° = 125°, because BA is opposite to BD, and angle between BD and BC is 55°, so adding that to the straight line from BA to BD gives 125°.

Then, the angle between BA and BG is the angle between BA and BC plus the angle between BC and BG? Or not. Wait, if BG is part of diameter CG, then from point B, direction to G is opposite to direction to C. So, if we have angle between BA and BC as 125°, then the angle between BA and BG would be 180° - 125° = 55°, because BG is in the opposite direction of BC. Wait, this is getting too vague without a diagram.

Alternatively, since angle CBD is 55°, and since BA is colinear with BD (opposite direction), then the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - 55° = 125°, as explained. Then, since BG is opposite to BC (because CG is a diameter), the angle between BA and BG would be 180° - 125° = 55°, because from BA to BC is 125°, and from BC to BG is 180°, so BA to BG would be 180° - 125° = 55°. Hence, the central angle between BA and BG is 55°, which means arc AG is 55°, confirming our earlier conclusion. 

Thus, the measure of arc AG is 55°, which corresponds to answer D. 

But wait, the answer choices include D.55, so that would be the correct answer. However, I need to ensure there's no error in assuming that the angle between BA and BG is 55°, leading to arc AG being 55°. All steps seem consistent. Therefore, the answer should be D.
