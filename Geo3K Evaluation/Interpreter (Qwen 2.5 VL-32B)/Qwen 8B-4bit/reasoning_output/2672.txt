<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with some given conditions. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I don't miss anything.

First, there are points B, C, D, A. All of them are points. Then there are lines connecting these points: Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(B,D), Line(A,D), Line(B,A), Line(C,A). Also, there are two triangles mentioned: Triangle(B,C,D) and Triangle(B,A,D). 

Now, looking at the predicates, there's a RightAngle for Angle(C,B,D). That means the angle at point B in triangle BCD is a right angle. Also, it says Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)). Wait, since those two lines meet at point C? Or wait, Line(C,B) and Line(C,D) – if they're perpendicular, then the angle between them is 90 degrees. But the right angle was specified for Angle(C,B,D), which would be at point B. Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this.

Then there are length equalities. Length of Line(B,C) is 30 units, Line(C,D) is 36, Line(C,A) is 28, and Line(A,D) is 8. Also, IsHypotenuseOf(Line(B,D), Triangle(B,C,D)) – so in triangle BCD, BD is the hypotenuse because it's opposite the right angle at B. Therefore, triangle BCD is a right triangle with legs BC=30 and CD=36, and hypotenuse BD. Let me check that with Pythagoras. BD should be sqrt(30² + 36²). Calculating that: 30 squared is 900, 36 squared is 1296, sum is 2196. Square root of 2196... Well, maybe I'll keep that as is for now.

Also, there's another triangle, Triangle(B,A,D), which is similar to Triangle(B,C,D). So similarity ratio comes into play here. Since they are similar, corresponding sides are proportional. Let me note that down.

So, triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD. Wait, but how do the correspondence work? The order matters. Triangle BCD corresponds to Triangle BAD. So vertex B corresponds to B, C corresponds to A, D corresponds to D? Wait, need to make sure about the correspondence. Because similar triangles have corresponding angles equal. Given that, let's see.

Original triangle is BCD, right-angled at B. The other triangle is BAD. Let me think about the angles. In triangle BCD, the right angle is at B. In triangle BAD, where is the right angle? Not sure yet. But since they are similar, the right angle must correspond. Let's see. Maybe the right angle in triangle BAD is at point A? Because if the original triangle had the right angle at B, then the corresponding angle in triangle BAD would be at the same position. Wait, but triangle BAD has vertices B, A, D. So if the right angle is at A, then angle at A would be the right angle. Alternatively, could be at D?

Wait, but also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)), which is angle at B in triangle BCD. So angle at B is 90 degrees. For similarity, the right angles must correspond. Therefore, in triangle BAD, the right angle must correspond to angle at B in triangle BCD. So in triangle BAD, the right angle would be at point A? Because the correspondence is BCD ~ BAD. So angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at B in BAD? Wait, that would mean the right angle is at B again. But then in triangle BAD, angle at B would be the right angle. However, looking at the lines given, there is Line(B,A) and Line(B,D), so point B is connected to A and D. If angle at B in triangle BAD is right, then BA and BD would be perpendicular. But does that hold?

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me think. Similarity can sometimes be ambiguous unless the order is clear. Let me consider the labeling. Triangle BCD ~ Triangle BAD. So the first vertex of each triangle corresponds. So B corresponds to B, C corresponds to A, D corresponds to D. So angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at B in BAD. Therefore, angle at B in BCD is right angle, so angle at B in BAD is also right angle. Thus, in triangle BAD, angle at B is right. Therefore, BA and BD are perpendicular. But according to the given data, Line(B,A) and Line(B,D) are present. So BA and BD are two lines meeting at B, forming a right angle. Therefore, triangle BAD is a right triangle with right angle at B. 

But wait, in triangle BAD, the sides would be BA, BD, AD. We know BA is Line(C,A) which is 28 units. Wait, no. Wait, Line(C,A) is 28. Wait, but BA is part of triangle BAD. Let me clarify:

In triangle BAD, the sides are BA, BD, and AD. From the given lengths:

- Line(C,A) = 28. But Line(C,A) is CA. How does that relate to BA? Are BA and CA related? There's a Line(C,A) which connects points C and A. So CA is 28. Also, Line(B,A) is BA, which is one side of triangle BAD. So BA is connected to point B and A. So BA is a separate segment from CA. Unless points are arranged in a certain way.

But let's get back to the similarity. If triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, then their sides are proportional. So:

BC / BA = CD / AD = BD / BD ?

Wait, let me write the ratios properly. For similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So in triangle BCD and triangle BAD, the correspondence is B -> B, C -> A, D -> D. Therefore:

Side BC in triangle BCD corresponds to side BA in triangle BAD.

Side CD in triangle BCD corresponds to side AD in triangle BAD.

Side BD in triangle BCD corresponds to side BD in triangle BAD.

Wait, that seems odd. If BD is a common side? Wait, triangle BCD has BD as hypotenuse. Triangle BAD has BD as one of its sides. So the correspondence would be:

In triangle BCD: sides BC, CD, BD.

In triangle BAD: sides BA, AD, BD.

Therefore, the ratios would be BC / BA = CD / AD = BD / BD = 1. Wait, that would imply BC = BA and CD = AD. But BC is 30, CD is 36, AD is 8. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, my assumption about the correspondence must be wrong.

Hmm. Maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD with different order. Like, maybe triangle BCD ~ triangle ABD instead? Let me check the labels again. The given similarity is Triangle(B,C,D) and Triangle(B,A,D). So the order is B-C-D vs B-A-D. So the correspondence is B→B, C→A, D→D. Hence, angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at B in BAD. Which we thought earlier leads to contradiction.

Alternative approach: Let's use coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points can help. Let me try that.

Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0) since there's a right angle at B. Since angle at B is right, then lines BC and BD are perpendicular. Wait, but earlier we have Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D))? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)). Wait, Line(C,B) is the same as Line(B,C). And Line(C,D) is from C to D. So those two lines are perpendicular. So Line CB and Line CD are perpendicular. Therefore, at point C, the lines CB and CD form a right angle. Wait, but earlier we had the right angle at B. So triangle BCD has a right angle at B, and also at point C, lines CB and CD are perpendicular? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I misread the predicate.

Wait, the given predicate is Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)). So Line CB and Line CD are perpendicular. So that implies that at point C, the lines CB and CD are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at C is right. But earlier, we were told that Angle(C,B,D) is a right angle, which is angle at B. So that would mean triangle BCD has a right angle at B and at C? That's impossible unless the triangle is degenerate. Wait, that suggests a mistake in understanding the predicates.

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) refers to angle at B. The notation Angle(C,B,D) means the angle at point B formed by points C, B, D. So angle at B. Then, the Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)) implies that at point C, the lines CB and CD are perpendicular. So angle at C between CB and CD is 90 degrees. So triangle BCD has right angles at B and C? Which can't happen unless the triangle is degenerate. So something is wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, maybe the Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)) refers to the lines being perpendicular, but not necessarily at the same point. Wait, no. Lines are infinite, but the Perpendicular relation between two lines usually refers to them intersecting at a right angle. So if Line CB and Line CD are perpendicular, they must intersect at a point where they are perpendicular. Since both lines contain point C (Line CB starts at C and goes to B; Line CD starts at C and goes to D), then they meet at point C. Therefore, the angle between them at point C is 90 degrees. So triangle BCD has a right angle at C. But earlier, the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) indicates a right angle at B. So triangle BCD has two right angles, which is impossible. This suggests a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) is referring to angle at D? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C,B,D) is angle at B. So this is confusing. There must be a mistake in the interpretation. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Given:

RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)): angle at B.

Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)): These lines are perpendicular. Since Line CB and Line CD share point C, they form a right angle at C. So triangle BCD has a right angle at C. But then, angle at B is also a right angle? That would require triangle BCD to have two right angles, which isn't possible unless it's a straight line. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless I'm misunderstanding the predicates.

Wait, maybe the lines aren't the same as the sides. Wait, Line(C,B) is the same as Line(B,C). Similarly, Line(C,D) is the same as Line(C,D). So if these two lines are perpendicular, then at point C, they form a right angle. So triangle BCD has a right angle at C. However, the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) refers to angle at B. So that would mean triangle BCD has two right angles at B and C. Which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) is referring to angle at D? No, the notation is Angle(C,B,D), which is angle at B. So this is conflicting. Let me check if there's another possibility. Could it be that the angle at B is not part of triangle BCD? But triangle BCD includes points B, C, D. So yes, angle at B is part of that triangle.

This contradiction suggests that perhaps the given predicates are inconsistent. But since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the Perpendicular condition. Let me re-read the predicate:

"Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D))" – this means that the two lines are perpendicular. But since both lines pass through point C, they form a right angle at point C. So triangle BCD has a right angle at C, making it a right triangle at C. However, the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) implies a right angle at B. So triangle BCD has two right angles. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I've misread the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the Angle(C,B,D) is not part of triangle BCD? But triangle BCD has points B, C, D. So angle at B is indeed part of the triangle. This seems like a contradiction. Maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps the Perpendicular predicate is between different lines?

Wait, maybe the Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(B,D))? No, the given predicate is Line(C,B) and Line(C,D). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Perpendicular is between Line(C,B) and Line(B,D)? That would make sense. Because if Line(C,B) and Line(B,D) are perpendicular, then angle at B is right, aligning with the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)). But the given predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)), not Line(B,D).

Alternatively, maybe there's a misprint and it should be Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(B,D))? Let me assume that for a moment. If that's the case, then angle at B is right, matching the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)), and the rest follows. But since the problem states Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)), I can't change that. Therefore, there's inconsistency in the given data. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at C is not part of the triangle BCD? No, triangle BCD includes point C. So this is very confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not in Euclidean geometry? Unlikely. Or maybe the triangle is not a standard triangle? 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not the sides of the triangle. Wait, Line(C,B) is part of the triangle BCD, as well as Line(C,D). So if they are perpendicular, then triangle BCD has a right angle at C. But the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)) says angle at B is right. So two right angles. 

This contradiction suggests that the given data is inconsistent. But since the problem is posed, I must have made a mistake. Let me try to proceed assuming that the Perpendicular condition is between Line(C,B) and Line(B,D), even though it's stated as Line(C,B) and Line(C,D). Perhaps a transcription error. Let me try that.

Assuming that Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(B,D)), which would make angle at B right, matching the RightAngle(Angle(C,B,D)). Then, triangle BCD is right-angled at B. Then, with BC = 30, CD = 36, BD as hypotenuse. Then BD would be sqrt(30^2 + 36^2) = sqrt(900+1296)=sqrt(2196). Simplify sqrt(2196): divide by 4, 2196/4=549, so sqrt(4*549)=2*sqrt(549). 549 factors: 549 ÷ 3 = 183, 183 ÷ 3 = 61. So sqrt(9*61) = 3√61. So BD = 2*3√61 = 6√61. Not sure if helpful yet.

Now, the other triangle is Triangle(B,A,D), which is similar to Triangle(B,C,D). Let's say the similarity ratio. If triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, then the ratio of their sides would be equal. Let's find the correspondence. Assuming the right angle is at B for both triangles. So in triangle BCD, right angle at B, and in triangle BAD, right angle at B. So the triangles are similar with right angles at B. 

Thus, the sides adjacent to the right angle in BCD are BC and BD. Wait, no. Wait, triangle BCD has legs BC and CD, hypotenuse BD. Triangle BAD has legs BA and BD, hypotenuse AD? Wait, no. If it's right-angled at B, then legs would be BA and BD, and hypotenuse AD. Wait, but AD is given as 8. Wait, let me think carefully.

In triangle BCD, right-angled at B, legs are BC=30 and CD=36, hypotenuse BD. In triangle BAD, right-angled at B, legs would be BA and BD, hypotenuse AD. Wait, but AD is given as 8. So the hypotenuse of triangle BAD is AD=8. So according to the similarity, the ratio of the sides should be consistent.

So the ratio of similarity between triangle BCD and triangle BAD would be the ratio of their corresponding sides. Let's denote the ratio as k. So, BC / BA = CD / BD = BD / AD.

From the given, BC=30, CD=36, BD= sqrt(30² + 36²), AD=8.

So setting up equations:

30 / BA = 36 / BD = BD / 8.

Let me take the first equality: 30 / BA = 36 / BD → cross multiply: 30 * BD = 36 * BA → BD = (36/30)*BA = (6/5)*BA.

Second equality: 36 / BD = BD / 8 → cross multiply: 36*8 = BD² → BD² = 288 → BD = sqrt(288) = 12*sqrt(2). Wait, but earlier calculation said BD = sqrt(30² + 36²) = sqrt(900+1296)=sqrt(2196). Let me compute sqrt(2196):

Well, 2196 divided by 4 is 549, so sqrt(2196)=sqrt(4*549)=2*sqrt(549). But if BD²=288 from the second equation, that would mean BD=sqrt(288)=12*sqrt(2). But this contradicts the previous value of BD from triangle BCD. So this suggests inconsistency. Hence, there's a problem here.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is different. Suppose triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD with different correspondence. Maybe the legs are matched differently. For example, BC corresponds to AD, and CD corresponds to BA. Let me try that.

So if triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, with BC corresponding to AD, CD corresponding to BA, and BD corresponding to BD. Then the ratios would be BC / AD = CD / BA = BD / BD = 1. So BC / AD = CD / BA → 30 / 8 = 36 / BA → Cross multiplying: 30 * BA = 8 * 36 → BA = (8*36)/30 = (288)/30 = 9.6. So BA would be 9.6, which is 48/5. But the given Line(C,A) is 28. How does that connect? 

Wait, Line(C,A) is CA=28. So CA is 28. But BA is a different segment. So BA is not directly related to CA unless points are arranged in a certain way. 

But if BA is 9.6, then in triangle BAD, which is right-angled at B, with legs BA=9.6 and BD=?, hypotenuse AD=8. Wait, but AD is given as 8. But if AD is the hypotenuse, then by Pythagoras: BA² + BD² = AD². But if AD=8, then 9.6² + BD² = 64 → BD² = 64 - 92.16 = -28.16, which is impossible. So this can't be.

This suggests that my assumption about the correspondence is wrong. Maybe the similarity is between different sides. Let me think again.

Alternatively, suppose triangle BCD ~ triangle ABD. Then the correspondence would be B->A, C->B, D->D. So angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at A in ABD. But since triangle BCD has a right angle at B, then triangle ABD would have a right angle at A. Let's explore this.

If triangle BCD ~ triangle ABD, then the ratio of sides would be:

BC / AB = CD / BD = BD / AD.

From given values:

BC = 30, CD=36, AD=8.

So BC / AB = CD / BD → 30 / AB = 36 / BD → 30BD = 36AB → BD = (36/30)AB = 1.2AB.

Also, CD / BD = BD / AD → 36 / BD = BD / 8 → BD² = 36*8 = 288 → BD = sqrt(288) = 12√2 ≈ 16.97.

Then, from BD = 1.2AB, AB = BD / 1.2 = (12√2) / 1.2 = 10√2 ≈ 14.14. 

But we also have Line(C,A) = 28. What is CA? Point C to point A. How is this connected to other parts?

Maybe we need to use coordinates again. Let me assign coordinates to points to model this. Let's try placing point B at (0,0). Since there's a right angle at B in triangle BCD, let's assume that BC is along x-axis and BD is along y-axis. Wait, but earlier there was confusion about the right angle location. Let me resolve this.

Assume triangle BCD is right-angled at B. So, let me set B at (0,0), C at (30,0) since BC=30, and D somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is horizontal, BD would be vertical. So D would be at (0,y) for some y. But CD is 36. The distance between C(30,0) and D(0,y) is sqrt((30)^2 + y^2) = 36. So 30² + y² = 36² → y² = 36² - 30² = (36-30)(36+30) = 6*66 = 396 → y = sqrt(396) = sqrt(4*99) = 2*sqrt(99) = 2*3*sqrt(11) = 6√11. So coordinates: B(0,0), C(30,0), D(0,6√11). Then BD length is from (0,0) to (0,6√11), which is 6√11. 

Now, we have triangle BAD similar to triangle BCD. Let's assume the similarity is such that triangle BAD ~ triangle BCD. Let's define the correspondence. If triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, then the order is B->B, C->A, D->D. So angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at B in BAD. So triangle BAD also has a right angle at B. Therefore, BA and BD are perpendicular. Since BD is along the y-axis from B(0,0) to D(0,6√11), then BA should be along the x-axis or some direction perpendicular to BD. Wait, BD is vertical, so BA would be horizontal. So point A lies somewhere along the x-axis? Or since BA is a line from B(0,0) to A(x, y), and since it's perpendicular to BD (which is vertical), BA must be horizontal. Therefore, A lies along the x-axis. Let me assume A is at (a,0). 

But then, line CA connects point C(30,0) to A(a,0). So CA is along the x-axis from (30,0) to (a,0), so its length is |30 - a|. Given that Line(C,A) is 28, so |30 - a| = 28 → a = 30 ± 28. So a = 58 or a = 2. 

But also, in triangle BAD, which is right-angled at B(0,0), with legs BA and BD. BA is from B(0,0) to A(a,0), so length is |a|. BD is from B(0,0) to D(0,6√11), length is 6√11. Hypotenuse AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,6√11), length is sqrt(a² + (6√11)^2). 

Since triangle BAD ~ triangle BCD, their sides are proportional. Let's write the ratios:

In triangle BCD, sides are BC=30, CD=36, BD=6√11.

In triangle BAD, sides are BA=|a|, BD=6√11, AD= sqrt(a² + (6√11)^2).

For similarity, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Assuming the correspondence B->B, C->A, D->D. So BC corresponds to BA, CD corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to BD. Wait, but BD corresponds to itself? That would mean BD/BD = 1, so BC/BA = CD/AD = 1. So BC=BA and CD=AD. But BC=30, CD=36, so AD=36. Let's check if that holds.

AD = sqrt(a² + (6√11)^2) = 36. So:

a² + 36*11 = 36² → a² + 396 = 1296 → a² = 1296 - 396 = 900 → a = 30 or -30. 

But earlier, we had a = 30 ± 28, so a = 58 or 2. But here, a is 30 or -30. Conflict. So this suggests inconsistency. 

Wait, but if a=30, then point A would be at (30,0), same as point C. But then CA would be zero length, which contradicts CA=28. If a=-30, then point A is at (-30,0). Then CA is distance from C(30,0) to A(-30,0) is 60, which is not 28. So this doesn't fit. 

This suggests that the correspondence may not be B->B, C->A, D->D. Let's try another correspondence. Maybe triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD with different correspondence. For example, B->A, C->B, D->D. So angle at B in BCD corresponds to angle at A in BAD. Since triangle BCD has a right angle at B, then triangle BAD has a right angle at A. So in triangle BAD, right angle at A. 

So in this case, the sides would be: in triangle BCD, sides BC, CD, BD. In triangle BAD, sides BA, AD, BD. With right angle at A. So the hypotenuse would be BD. So for similarity, the ratios would be BC / BA = CD / AD = BD / BD = 1. So BC/BA = CD/AD → 30/BA = 36/AD → 30AD = 36BA → AD = (36/30)BA = 1.2BA. 

Also, since triangle BAD is right-angled at A, by Pythagoras: BA² + AD² = BD². Substituting AD = 1.2BA:

BA² + (1.2BA)² = BD² → BA² + 1.44BA² = BD² → 2.44BA² = BD² → BD = BA * sqrt(2.44). 

But BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BCD, which we calculated earlier as 6√11. So BD = 6√11. Thus:

6√11 = BA * sqrt(2.44)

But 2.44 is approximately 2.44, but let's express it exactly. Since 1.2² = 1.44, so total factor is 1 + 1.44 = 2.44. Let me write 2.44 as 61/25 (since 61/25 = 2.44). Wait, 61/25 is 2.44. Yes. So sqrt(61/25) = sqrt(61)/5. So:

BD = BA * sqrt(61)/5 → 6√11 = BA * sqrt(61)/5 → BA = (6√11 * 5)/sqrt(61) = 30√11 / sqrt(61). Rationalizing denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(61):

BA = 30√(11*61)/61 = 30√671 / 61. This seems complicated and likely not matching the given Line(C,A)=28. 

But we also have Line(C,A)=28. Point C is at (30,0), and point A is somewhere. If triangle BAD is right-angled at A, then A is the right angle. Let me try to find coordinates for A.

Let me assume point A is at (x,y). Since triangle BAD is right-angled at A, vectors AB and AD are perpendicular. Vector AB is (B - A) = (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector AD is (D - A) = (0 - x, 6√11 - y) = (-x, 6√11 - y). Their dot product should be zero:

(-x)(-x) + (-y)(6√11 - y) = 0 → x² - y(6√11 - y) = 0 → x² - 6√11 y + y² = 0.

Also, Line(C,A) is the distance between C(30,0) and A(x,y) is 28:

√[(x - 30)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 28 → (x - 30)^2 + y² = 784.

Additionally, since triangle BAD is right-angled at A, and BD is the hypotenuse, we have BA² + AD² = BD². Let's calculate:

BA² = x² + y².

AD² = (distance from A to D)^2 = x² + (6√11 - y)^2.

BD² = (distance from B to D)^2 = (0-0)^2 + (6√11 - 0)^2 = (6√11)^2 = 36*11 = 396.

So from Pythagoras:

x² + y² + x² + (6√11 - y)^2 = 396.

Expand (6√11 - y)^2 = 36*11 - 12√11 y + y² = 396 - 12√11 y + y².

So overall:

x² + y² + x² + 396 - 12√11 y + y² = 396 → 2x² + 2y² - 12√11 y + 396 = 396 → 2x² + 2y² - 12√11 y = 0 → Divide by 2: x² + y² - 6√11 y = 0.

Which is the same as the earlier equation from the dot product: x² + y² - 6√11 y = 0.

So we have two equations:

1. (x - 30)^2 + y² = 784.

2. x² + y² - 6√11 y = 0.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(x - 30)^2 + y² - (x² + y² - 6√11 y) = 784 - 0 → Expand (x-30)^2 = x² - 60x + 900.

So substituting:

x² - 60x + 900 + y² - x² - y² + 6√11 y = 784 → -60x + 900 + 6√11 y = 784 → -60x + 6√11 y = 784 - 900 = -116 → Divide both sides by 2: -30x + 3√11 y = -58 → 3√11 y = 30x - 58 → y = (30x - 58)/(3√11).

Now, substitute this expression for y into equation 2: x² + y² - 6√11 y = 0.

Let me denote y = (30x - 58)/(3√11). Plugging into equation 2:

x² + [(30x - 58)^2]/[9*11] - 6√11 * [(30x - 58)/(3√11)] = 0.

Simplify term by term:

First term: x².

Second term: [(30x - 58)^2]/(99).

Third term: 6√11 * (30x - 58)/(3√11) = 2*(30x - 58).

So equation becomes:

x² + [(30x - 58)^2]/99 - 2*(30x - 58) = 0.

Multiply entire equation by 99 to eliminate denominator:

99x² + (30x - 58)^2 - 198*(30x - 58) = 0.

Expand (30x - 58)^2 = 900x² - 3480x + 3364.

So:

99x² + 900x² - 3480x + 3364 - 198*(30x - 58) = 0.

Calculate 198*(30x - 58) = 5940x - 11484.

Now combine terms:

99x² + 900x² = 999x².

-3480x - 5940x = -9420x.

3364 - (-11484)? Wait, no. It's +3364 - 198*(...) which is +3364 - 5940x + 11484?

Wait, no. Original expression is:

99x² + [900x² - 3480x + 3364] - [5940x - 11484] = 0.

So expanding:

99x² + 900x² - 3480x + 3364 - 5940x + 11484 = 0.

Combine like terms:

x² terms: 99x² + 900x² = 999x².

x terms: -3480x -5940x = -9420x.

Constants: 3364 + 11484 = 14848.

So equation: 999x² - 9420x + 14848 = 0.

Divide all terms by GCD of coefficients. Let's see: 999, 9420, 14848. Let me check GCD(999,9420). 999 divides by 3: 999=3*333. 9420 ÷ 3 = 3140. 3140 and 999: GCD(3140, 999). 3140 ÷ 999 = 3*999=2997, remainder 143. Now GCD(999,143). 999 ÷ 143 = 7*143=1001, remainder -2. GCD(143,2). 143 ÷ 2 = 71*2=142, remainder 1. GCD(2,1) is 1. So overall GCD is 1. So cannot simplify further.

Now, solving quadratic equation 999x² - 9420x + 14848 = 0. Let's use quadratic formula:

x = [9420 ± √(9420² - 4*999*14848)]/(2*999).

This looks messy. Let me compute discriminant D:

D = 9420² - 4*999*14848.

Compute 9420²: 9420 * 9420. This is a large number. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the derivation. This seems too complicated for a problem with answer choices A-D. Perhaps there's a simpler approach.

Wait, going back, we had from the similarity ratio: AD = 1.2BA, and from Pythagoras, BD² = BA² + AD² = BA² + (1.2BA)^2 = BA²(1 + 1.44) = BA² * 2.44. But BD is known as 6√11, so:

(6√11)^2 = 36*11 = 396 = BA² * 2.44 → BA² = 396 / 2.44.

Convert 2.44 to fraction: 2.44 = 244/100 = 61/25. So BA² = 396 * 25 / 61 = (396/61)*25.

Calculate 396 ÷ 61: 61*6=366, 396-366=30. So 396/61 = 6 + 30/61. So BA² = (6 + 30/61)*25 = 150 + (750/61). Not helpful. 

But we also have Line(C,A)=28. Point C is at (30,0), point A is somewhere. If we can find BA in terms of x and y, and relate to CA=28. This seems too involved. Maybe there's a miscalculation earlier.

Alternatively, let's go back to the initial assumption that the Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)) is incorrect, and instead it should be Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(B,D)), leading to the right angle at B. Let me try that.

Assume Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(B,D)), so at point B, lines CB and BD are perpendicular. So triangle BCD has right angle at B. Then, BC=30, CD=36, BD= sqrt(30² + 36²) = sqrt(2196) = 6√61. 

Now, triangle BAD similar to triangle BCD. Assume similarity with correspondence B->B, C->A, D->D. So triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, with right angle at B. So triangle BAD has right angle at B. So legs are BA and BD, hypotenuse AD. 

So, ratios: BC/BA = CD/AD = BD/BD = 1. So BC = BA, CD = AD. But BC=30, so BA=30, CD=36, so AD=36. But given AD=8. Contradiction. So this can't be.

Alternatively, correspondence B->A, C->B, D->D. So triangle BCD ~ triangle ABD. So angle at B corresponds to angle at A. So triangle ABD has right angle at A. So legs are AB and AD, hypotenuse BD. 

Then, BC/AB = CD/AD = BD/BD = 1. So BC=AB, CD=AD. Given BC=30, so AB=30, CD=36, so AD=36. But given AD=8. Again, contradiction.

Another possibility: triangle BCD ~ triangle ABD with different correspondence. Let's say B->A, C->D, D->B. So angle at B corresponds to angle at A, angle at C corresponds to angle at D, angle at D corresponds to angle at B. This might not make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is between triangle BCD and triangle BAD with different side correspondence. Let's say BC corresponds to AD, CD corresponds to BD, and BD corresponds to BA. So:

BC/AD = CD/BD = BD/BA.

Given BC=30, CD=36, BD=6√61, AD=8, BA is unknown.

So:

30/8 = 36/(6√61) = (6√61)/BA.

Check if 30/8 equals 36/(6√61):

36/(6√61) = 6/√61 ≈ 6/7.81 ≈ 0.768.

30/8 = 3.75. Not equal. So not matching.

Alternatively, 30/AD = CD/BD → 30/8 = 36/(6√61) → 30/8 = 6/√61 → 30/8 = 6/√61 → cross-multiply: 30√61 = 48 → √61 = 48/30 = 1.6 → √61 ≈ 1.6, but actual √61 ≈ 7.81. Not true.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe there's a different approach. Since the problem gives us that triangle BCD is similar to triangle BAD, and asks for y, which I assume is the length of AD or something else. Wait, the question says "Find y." But the problem didn't specify what y represents. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it just says "Find y." But in the given predicates, there's no mention of y. Wait, this is missing! The user might have omitted defining what y is. Wait, looking back at the original problem, perhaps y is the length of AD? Or maybe it's the length of BA, or something else. Wait, the given lengths are for BC=30, CD=36, CA=28, AD=8. Wait, AD is given as 8, which is already part of the data. So perhaps y is another length, like BD or something else? Or perhaps it's the length of BA, which is unknown?

Wait, the problem might have a diagram where y is a particular segment, but since it's text-based, I need to infer. Given that the answer choices are A. 8, B. 9, C. 12, D. 15, and AD is 8, which is already given, so y is probably another length. Let me look at the given predicates again. 

We have Line(C,A) = 28, which is CA=28. Line(A,D)=8, which is AD=8. So if y is BA, then we need to find BA. Or maybe BD? Or something else.

Looking back at the problem: "Find y." Without more context, it's hard to tell, but often in such problems, y is a missing length. Given the options, and the presence of 8, 9, 12, 15, and given the similarity, let me reconsider the similarity ratio.

Earlier, I tried assuming triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD with right angles at B, leading to BD=6√61, and trying to find BA such that the similarity holds. Let me try that again with correct correspondence.

If triangle BCD ~ triangle BAD, with right angles at B. So the sides around the right angle are BC and CD for BCD, and BA and BD for BAD. So the ratio of similarity is BC/BA = CD/BD = BD/AD.

From given:

BC=30, CD=36, AD=8, BD= sqrt(30² + 36²) = sqrt(2196) = 6√61.

So, BC/BA = CD/BD → 30/BA = 36/(6√61) → 30/BA = 6/√61 → BA = 30 * √61 / 6 = 5
