Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center O, and points A, B, C, D, E, F on it. The problem says EC and AB are diameters. Also, there are several congruent angles mentioned: ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≅ ∠EOF ≅ ∠FOA. And they mention that measure of ∠EOF is 90 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc AC.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since EC and AB are diameters, they pass through the center O. That means points E and C are endpoints of one diameter, and A and B are endpoints of another. Also, since O is the center, OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF are all radii of the circle, so they're all equal in length. 

Now, looking at the congruent angles: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. Wait, the problem states that these angles are congruent. Let me check the given predicates again. It says Congruent(Angle(B,O,D), Angle(D,O,E)), Congruent(Angle(D,O,E), Angle(E,O,F)), Congruent(Angle(E,O,F), Angle(F,O,A)). So each adjacent angle is congruent. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(E,O,F)) is 90 degrees. So each of those angles is 90 degrees? Wait, but if they are congruent, then all four angles (∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA) are equal. But since ∠EOF is given as 90°, each of them must be 90°, right?

Wait, but hold on. There are four angles here: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. Each consecutive pair is congruent. So starting from ∠BO D, then ∠DOE, then ∠EOF, then ∠FOA. Since ∠EOF is 90°, then each of these angles must be 90°. Therefore, each of those four angles is 90°, making a total around point O of 4*90° = 360°, which makes sense because they form a full circle around the center.

But wait, how does this relate to the arcs? Because the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, here we have central angles, since the vertex is at the center O. So, the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if ∠BO D is 90°, then arc BD would be 90°, similarly for other angles.

Let me try to map out the positions of the points. Starting from point B, moving through D, E, F, and back to A. Since each of these angles is 90°, each step moves 90° around the circle. So, starting from point B, going to D, then E, then F, then A. Let's see:

- ∠BO D is 90°, so the arc from B to D is 90°.
- Then ∠DOE is 90°, so arc DE is 90°.
- ∠EOF is 90°, so arc EF is 90°.
- ∠FOA is 90°, so arc FA is 90°.

So adding up these arcs: BD + DE + EF + FA = 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which covers the entire circle. Wait, but where is point A located? Let me think. Starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. So, starting from B, going counterclockwise, the points are B, D, E, F, A. So, the order around the circle is B -> D -> E -> F -> A.

But also, AB is a diameter. So points A and B are endpoints of a diameter. So, the arc from A to B should be 180°, since it's a straight line through the center. Wait, but according to our previous mapping, moving from A back to B would require going through the rest of the circle. Wait, maybe my assumption about the direction is wrong. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that each angle corresponds to moving 90° increments. For example, starting from B, each subsequent angle adds 90°, leading to points D, E, F, and finally A. So, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°, and then from A back to B would be another 90°, but that would make the total 360°, but since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°, which contradicts unless there's overlapping.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me consider that AB is a diameter. So points A and B are directly opposite each other. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E and C are directly opposite each other.

Given that, let's try to place the points. Let me imagine the circle with center O. Let's assume AB is horizontal, with A on the left and B on the right. Then, since EC is another diameter, points E and C are somewhere else. Now, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all 90°, so each of these angles is formed by two radii. 

Starting with ∠BO D: that angle is at O, between points B and D. Since ∠BO D is 90°, then the arc BD is 90°. Then, ∠DOE is also 90°, so arc DE is 90°, and so on. So, if we start at point B, moving 90° along the circumference to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. So, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°, totaling 360°, which loops back to B. But since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°, but according to this, the arc from F to A is 90°, and then from A to B would be... Well, depending on the position of B relative to F. Wait, maybe the arc from A to B passes through F? Or maybe not. Maybe the points are arranged differently.

Alternatively, maybe the points are placed such that each angle is between successive points. Let me think again. The angles given are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. So, starting from B, the first angle is between B and D, then between D and E, then E and F, then F and A. Each of these angles is 90°, so the arcs between B-D, D-E, E-F, F-A are each 90°, summing to 360°. Therefore, the arc from A back to B would go through the remaining part of the circle. Wait, but since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°, so the arc from A to B could be either the short way (180°) or the long way (also 180°). But according to the above, the arc from F to A is 90°, then from A to B would be another 90°, making arc AB as 90°+ something? No, that doesn't add up. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to visualize the circle with center O. Suppose AB is a diameter. Let me fix points A and B at the top and bottom, or left and right. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let’s say O is at (0,0). Let’s take AB as a horizontal diameter, with A at (-r, 0) and B at (r, 0), where r is the radius. Now, EC is another diameter. Let me assume E and C are positioned such that EC is vertical, so E is at (0, r) and C is at (0, -r). But then, the angles given involve points D, D, E, F, etc. Hmm, but the problem mentions points D, E, F. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that each angle is 90°, creating a square-like structure. Since there are four angles each of 90°, maybe the points are spaced every 90° around the circle. Let me think. If each angle between successive points is 90°, then the points are separated by 90° arcs. So, starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. Thus, the order around the circle would be B, D, E, F, A. But since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°, so the arc from A to B passing through the points would be... Let's see. From A to B, if the points are ordered as B, D, E, F, A, then the arc from A to B would go through F, E, D, and B. Wait, but that would be three segments of 90° each (from A to F is 90°, F to E is 90°, E to D is 90°, D to B is 90°)? No, that would be more than 180°. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc from A to B is directly across the circle, i.e., 180°, so the points must be arranged such that from A to B is 180°, while the other arcs are parts of that. This seems conflicting. Maybe I need to consider the positions of points D, E, F in relation to A and B.

Since AB is a diameter, and EC is a diameter. Let me consider that E and C are endpoints of another diameter. Let me suppose that the angles mentioned are created by connecting various points. For instance, ∠BO D is formed by points B, O, D. Since O is the center, OD is a radius. So, OD is a radius, same as OB. Since ∠BO D is 90°, then triangle BOD is a right-angled triangle at O. Wait, but O is the center. So, OB and OD are both radii, so triangle BOD is isoceles with OB=OD. If the angle at O is 90°, then the triangle is a right-angled isoceles triangle, so the legs are equal and hypotenuse is sqrt(2)*radius. But how does this help?

Alternatively, since ∠BO D is 90°, the arc BD is 90°, as the central angle equals the arc measure. So, arc BD is 90°, arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°, arc FA is 90°, totaling 360°, which loops around the circle. Therefore, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°, and then from A back to B would require another 90°, making the arc AB 90° + ... Wait, but AB is supposed to be a diameter, so the arc AB should be 180°, not 90°. This suggests inconsistency. Where is the error here?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the arc from A back to B isn't just the direct arc but includes other points. Let me think again. If the points are arranged in the order B → D → E → F → A, then the arc from A to B would go through F, E, D, and B. So, arc AF is 90°, FE is 90°, ED is 90°, DB is 90°, totaling 90*4=360°, which loops around the circle. But that implies that the arc from A to B is actually going the long way around the circle, which is 360°, but that's impossible. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the arc AB is the shorter arc, which is 180°, but according to the arrangement, the arc from A to B via the other points would be 360° minus the arc from A to B directly. So, if the arc from A to B directly is 180°, then the arc from A to B going the other way is also 180°, but according to the earlier breakdown, it's 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which is incorrect. Hence, there's a contradiction here.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the placement of the points might be wrong. Perhaps the angles aren't all consecutive around the circle. Let me reconsider the angles. The angles given are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. These are four angles, each at the center O. So, each angle is between two radii. So, the first angle is between OB and OD, then between OD and OE, then between OE and OF, then between OF and OA. So, these four angles are adjacent, forming a full circle around O. Since each is 90°, they add up to 360°, which checks out. 

Therefore, the points B, D, E, F, A are arranged around the circle such that each consecutive pair defines a 90° arc. So starting at B, moving 90° to D, then 90° to E, then 90° to F, then 90° to A. So, the order is B → D → E → F → A. Now, since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B must be 180°, but according to the current arrangement, the arc from A to B would go through F, E, D, B. Let me calculate the arc from A to B via the shortest path. 

From A to B, the arc that goes through F, E, D is 90° (FA) + 90° (ED) + 90° (DB)? Wait, no. Wait, the arc from A to F is 90°, from F to E is another 90°, from E to D is 90°, and from D to B is 90°, totaling 360°, which loops around. But the arc from A to B directly is the other way, which is the minor arc AB. How much is that?

Since the points are arranged as B, D, E, F, A in order around the circle, the arc from A to B going the other way would be the arc from A to F to E to D to B? No, that's the same as before. Wait, maybe I need to think of the circle divided into four 90° arcs: BD, DE, EF, FA. So, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. So, the total is 360°, but AB is a diameter, which is 180°. Therefore, the arc from A to B must be half the circle. How does this fit?

If the arc from A to B is 180°, then the arc from A to B must pass through the points that are halfway around the circle. But according to the current setup, from A, moving clockwise, we have F, then E, then D, then B. The arc from A to B through F, E, D is 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, which is longer than 180°. Therefore, the other arc, going counter-clockwise from A to B, would be the remaining arc. Wait, but since the total is 360°, the arc from A to B going the other way would be 360° - 270° = 90°, but that's not possible because AB is a diameter. So, something's wrong here.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The arc from A to B is not necessarily going through the points F, E, D. Instead, the arc AB is the direct diameter, so it's the shortest path. Therefore, the arc AB must be 180°, which implies that the points are arranged such that the arc from A to B is indeed 180°, regardless of the other arcs. So, how do the other arcs fit in?

Maybe the points are arranged such that arc AB is composed of parts of the other arcs. For example, if the arc from A to B is 180°, and the arc from A to F is 90°, then the arc from F to B would be 180° - 90° = 90°. But according to our earlier setup, the arc from F to B would be arc FE + ED + DB. Arc FE is 90°, ED is 90°, DB is 90°, totaling 270°, which conflicts. So, there's inconsistency here.

Perhaps I need to consider that the arc AB is not part of the sequence B→D→E→F→A. Maybe the points are arranged differently. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Suppose we have AB as a diameter. Let me fix A at (1,0) and B at (-1,0) assuming unit circle for simplicity. Now, EC is another diameter. Let's say E is at (0,1) and C is at (0,-1). Now, we need to find points D and F such that the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are each 90°.

Starting with ∠BO D being 90°. Point B is at (-1,0), O is at (0,0). So, vector OB is pointing to (-1,0). The angle between OB and OD is 90°, so OD is perpendicular to OB. Since OB is along negative x-axis, OD would be along positive y-axis or negative y-axis. But E is already at (0,1), so maybe D is at (0,1)? Wait, but E is at (0,1). So, if D is at (0,1), then ∠BO D would be between OB (-x axis) and OD (+y axis), which is 90°, yes. So D is at (0,1), which is point E? No, because E is at (0,1). Wait, but the problem has points E and C as endpoints of diameter EC. So, if E is at (0,1), then C is at (0,-1). So, D is at (0,1)? That would mean D coincides with E, which can't be. So, that's not possible. Therefore, my assumption may be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe D is at (0,-1), which is point C. But then ∠BO D would be between OB (-x) and OC (which is along negative y-axis?), no. Wait, if D is at (0,-1), then OD is along negative y-axis. The angle between OB (-x) and OD (-y) is 90°, yes. So, ∠BO D is 90°, which works. So, D is at (0,-1), which is point C? But EC is a diameter, so C is at (0,-1) and E at (0,1). So, D cannot be C. So, this suggests that D is point C? Which would mean that D=C. But the problem lists points D, E, F separately. So, that's conflicting.

This indicates that my coordinate assignment may not align with the problem's conditions. Let me try a different approach.

Since AB and EC are diameters, then points A and B are opposites, and points E and C are opposites. Also, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are each 90°. Let's focus on the angles involving these points. 

Each of these angles is at the center O, so they represent central angles. The measure of each central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. So, arc BD is 90°, arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°, arc FA is 90°. Adding these up gives 90°×4=360°, which completes the circle. So, the points B, D, E, F, A are placed around the circle such that each adjacent pair is 90° apart. 

Now, since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B should be 180°. But according to the arcs we've defined, the arc from A to B would depend on the path taken. If the points are ordered as B → D → E → F → A around the circle, then the arc from A to B would go through F, E, D, B, which is 90° (AF) + 90° (FE) + 90° (ED) + 90° (DB) = 360°, which is the whole circle. But that's impossible because AB is a diameter, so the arc AB should be 180°. Therefore, there must be an error in assuming the order of the points.

Wait, perhaps the arc from A to B is not the one going through F, E, D, but instead, it's the other arc. Let me think: if the points are arranged as B, D, E, F, A around the circle, then the arc from A to B can be either the short arc or the long arc. If the arc from A to B is the short one, then it's 180°, so the arc AB must be composed of certain parts of the 90° arcs. Let's see: if the arc from A to B is 180°, and the arc from A to F is 90°, then the arc from F to B would be 180° - 90° = 90°. But according to our earlier breakdown, arc from F to B would be arc FE + ED + DB = 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, which doesn't match. 

This suggests that my understanding of the arc placements is incorrect. Let me try to visualize this differently. Perhaps the arcs are not all in one direction. For example, maybe some arcs are clockwise and others are counterclockwise. Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in a different sequence.

Another possibility: the angles are not in the order I thought. The angles given are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. So, the points are connected as follows: from B to D, then D to E, then E to F, then F to A. So, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. So, the total arc from B to A is 90° (BD) + 90° (DE) + 90° (EF) + 90° (FA) = 360°, which loops around the circle. But AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B should be 180°. This implies that the arc from A to B is the complement of the arc from B to A. Wait, but the arc from B to A is 360°, which is the whole circle, so the arc from A to B is also 360°, which is not possible. Clearly, there's a fundamental flaw in this reasoning.

I must be missing something. Let me revisit the problem statement. It says that EC and AB are diameters. So, E and C are endpoints of one diameter, A and B are endpoints of another. Also, the angles mentioned are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, each congruent to 90°. Wait, but the measure of ∠EOF is given as 90°, so each of those angles is 90°, hence each arc corresponding to those angles is 90°. 

Let me try to find the arc AC. The question asks for m∠AC, which is the measure of arc AC. To find this, I need to determine the arc from A to C. 

Since AB and EC are diameters, and points are arranged such that the angles between successive points are 90°, maybe I can find the positions of A and C relative to each other. 

Let me consider that arc AB is 180°, and arc EC is also 180°. Let me try to express arc AC in terms of other arcs. 

Assume that the points are arranged as follows: starting from A, going through F, E, D, B, then continuing. Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should use the fact that the total circle is 360°, and break down the arcs. 

We know that arc BD = 90°, arc DE = 90°, arc EF = 90°, arc FA = 90°. So, from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. So, the total from B to A is 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which means that the arc from B to A goes all the way around the circle, implying that the arc from A to B is the same as the arc from B to A, which is 360°, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from B to A is actually the other way around, which would be the minor arc. But how?

Wait, perhaps the arc from B to D is 90°, but in the opposite direction. Like, if the arc from B to D is 90° in one direction, then the arc from D to B is 270° in the other direction. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that arc BD is 90°, arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°, and arc FA is 90°, but the arc AB is the sum of arc AF + arc FE + arc ED + arc DB? No, that would be 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which again loops around. 

At this point, I realize I need to switch approaches. Let me focus on finding arc AC. 

Arc AC is the arc from A to C. Since EC is a diameter, C is the endpoint of the diameter opposite to E. Let me find the position of C. 

If I can determine the positions of A and C relative to each other, I can compute the arc. Let me assume that the points are placed such that the angles mentioned divide the circle into four 90° arcs. Let me try to assign positions:

Start from point A. Let's say A is at angle 0°. Then, since ∠FOA is 90°, which is the angle at O between F and A. So, if A is at 0°, then F is at 90° (since the angle between OF and OA is 90°). Then, ∠EOF is 90°, so the angle between OE and OF is 90°. Since OF is at 90°, then OE is at 90° - 90° = 0°? No, wait. If ∠EOF is 90°, then the angle between OE and OF is 90°. If OF is at 90°, then OE would be at 90° - 90° = 0°, but that would put E at the same position as A, which is not possible. So, this suggests a different arrangement.

Alternatively, if A is at 0°, then ∠FOA is 90°, so OF is at 90°. Then, ∠EOF is 90°, so the angle between OE and OF is 90°. So, if OF is at 90°, then OE is at 90° ± 90°, so either 0° or 180°. But 0° is A, so OE would be at 180°, making E at 180°. Then, ∠DOE is 90°, so the angle between OD and OE is 90°. Since OE is at 180°, then OD would be at 180° ± 90° = 90° or 270°. But OF is already at 90°, so OD would be at 270°. Then, ∠BO D is 90°, so the angle between OB and OD is 90°. Since OD is at 270°, then OB is at 270° ± 90° = 180° or 360° (which is 0°). If OB is at 180°, then B is at 180°, which is the same as E. But E is at 180°, so B would coincide with E, which is not allowed. Alternatively, if OB is at 0°, which is point A, but B is a distinct point. So this also leads to conflict.

This suggests that placing A at 0° is causing issues. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider that the four angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA each are 90°, and they form a full rotation around O. So, the total angle around O is 360°, which is consistent. 

Now, let's consider the positions of points A and C. Since EC is a diameter, C is the antipodal point of E. Let me denote the positions of all points in terms of angles from the center O. 

Let me define the angles for each point:

- Let’s denote the angle for point A as θ_A.
- Point B is diametrically opposite to A, so θ_B = θ_A + 180°.
- Point E is such that EC is a diameter, so θ_C = θ_E + 180°.
- The angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are each 90°. Let's analyze these angles.

Starting with ∠BO D: this is the angle between OB and OD, which is 90°. So, the angle between vectors OB and OD is 90°. Similarly for the others.

Let me assume that the points are placed such that the angles between successive points are 90°. Let's try to define the positions step by step.

Start with point B. Let’s set θ_B = 0° for simplicity. Then, since ∠BO D is 90°, the angle between OB (which is at 0°) and OD is 90°, so θ_D = 0° + 90° = 90°. 

Next, ∠DOE is 90°, so the angle between OD (at 90°) and OE is 90°, so θ_E = 90° + 90° = 180°. 

Then, ∠EOF is 90°, so the angle between OE (at 180°) and OF is 90°, so θ_F = 180° + 90° = 270°. 

Finally, ∠FOA is 90°, so the angle between OF (at 270°) and OA is 90°, so θ_A = 270° + 90° = 360°, which is equivalent to 0°. Wait, but θ_B was set to 0°, so this implies that point A is at 0°, which is the same as point B. That's not possible, since A and B are distinct points (they are endpoints of a diameter). So this suggests a contradiction. What went wrong here?

Ah, because if θ_A is 0°, then point A is at the same position as B, which is invalid. So, this implies that our assumption about the direction of the angles is incorrect. Perhaps the angles are measured in the other direction. Let me try reversing the direction.

Let me assume that the angle ∠BO D is measured clockwise. So, starting from OB at 0°, rotating clockwise by 90° to get to OD. So, θ_D = 0° - 90° = 270°. 

Then, ∠DOE is 90° clockwise, so from OD at 270°, rotate 90° clockwise to get to OE: 270° - 90° = 180°. 

Then, ∠EOF is 90° clockwise, so from OE at 180°, subtract 90°: 180° - 90° = 90°. 

Then, ∠FOA is 90° clockwise, so from OF at 90°, subtract 90°: 90° - 90° = 0°, which is θ_A = 0°. Again, this puts A at 0°, which is the same as B (since θ_B was set to 0°). Conflict again.

This suggests that setting θ_B to 0° causes A to overlap with B. To resolve this, maybe θ_B is not 0°, but another value. Let me try assigning θ_B = 90°. Then:

- ∠BO D is 90°, so θ_D = θ_B + 90° = 90° + 90° = 180° (if measured counterclockwise) or θ_D = θ_B - 90° = 0° (if measured clockwise). Let's try counterclockwise: θ_D = 180°.

Then, ∠DOE is 90° counterclockwise, so θ_E = θ_D + 90° = 180° + 90° = 270°.

Next, ∠EOF is 90° counterclockwise, so θ_F = θ_E + 90° = 270° + 90° = 360° = 0°.

Then, ∠FOA is 90° counterclockwise, so θ_A = θ_F + 90° = 0° + 90° = 90°. 

Now, point A is at 90°, and point B is at 90°? No, point B was initially set to 90°. Wait, no: originally, θ_B was set to 90°, and now θ_A is 90°, which means A and B are at the same position, which is not allowed. So, this still causes a conflict.

This suggests that the issue arises because when we set θ_B, it overlaps with θ_A. To prevent this, perhaps the angles are measured in a mix of directions, or the initial assumption is wrong. Let me try measuring some angles clockwise and others counterclockwise. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not all in the same direction. For example, ∠BO D is measured clockwise, ∠DOE is counterclockwise, etc. But without knowing the direction, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me try a different approach. Since AB is a diameter, and EC is a diameter, and the angles between the radii are each 90°, maybe the points A and C are positioned such that arc AC spans certain number of these 90° arcs. 

From earlier, we have arcs BD = 90°, DE = 90°, EF = 90°, FA = 90°. If I can find the relationship between A and C, I can determine arc AC.

Since EC is a diameter, C is the antipodal point of E. Let me find the position of E. 

From the earlier steps, if we assume that the points are arranged in the order B, D, E, F, A around the circle, then E is between D and F. Let's say arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°. So, if I can find the position of E, then C is the antipodal point.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. Let me try to find arc AC. 

Assuming that the points are arranged such that from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. So, starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then 90° to F, then 90° to A. So, the total from B to A is 360°, which loops around the circle. This implies that the arc from A to B is the same as the arc from B to A, which is 360°, but that's impossible. Hence, this suggests that the arc from A to B is the other way, which would be 0°, but that's not possible. 

Wait, but if the arc from B to A is 360°, then the arc from A to B is 0°, which is not possible. This indicates that my model is flawed. 

At this point, I think I need to recognize that the arc AC is made up of several of these 90° arcs. Let me consider the positions of A and C. Since EC is a diameter, C is opposite E. If I can determine the arc from E to C, which is 180°, and then relate that to the other arcs.

Let me think: if E is at some position, then C is 180° away from E. Let's say the arc from E to C is 180°. If I can express the arc from A to C in terms of other arcs.

From the earlier setup, we have arc FA = 90°, arc EF = 90°, arc DE = 90°, arc BD = 90°. Let me try to find the arc from A to C.

Assume that point A is at the end of arc FA, which is 90°. Let's say the arc from F to A is 90°. Then, to get from A to C, we need to go through other points. Let me try to trace from A to C.

If I start at A, and want to get to C, which is the antipodal point of E. Let me assume that E is at some position. Let's say from earlier steps, if we have arc DE = 90°, and arc EF = 90°, then E is 90° from D and 90° from F. If I can find where E is, I can find C.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. Let me try to use the fact that the total circle is 360°, and the arc from A to C is the sum of arc AF + arc FE + arc ED + arc DC? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider that arc AC is equal to the sum of arc AF + arc FE + arc ED + arc DC. Wait, but I don't know arc DC. 

Alternatively, since EC is a diameter, arc EC is 180°. So, if I can express arc EC in terms of other arcs. For example, arc EC = arc ED + arc DF + arc FC? No, this depends on the position of D and F.

This seems too vague. Let me try to look for another approach. The problem asks for the measure of arc AC. Given that AB and EC are diameters, and the angles between the radii are each 90°, maybe arc AC is made up of two of these 90° arcs. For example, if from A to C passes through F and E, then arc AC would be arc AF + arc FE = 90° + 90° = 180°, making it a semicircle. But this would mean that arc AC is 180°, so the measure is 180°, which is option C. But let me verify.

If arc AF is 90° and arc FE is 90°, then arc AE is 180°, so point E is diametrically opposite to A. But EC is a diameter, so C is diametrically opposite to E. Thus, C would be diametrically opposite to E, which is the same as being diametrically opposite to A, making C the same as B? No, because AB is another diameter. This would imply that C is B, which is not possible. So this suggests arc AC is not 180°.

Wait, but if arc AE is 180°, then E is opposite A, and C is opposite E, so C would be opposite A, which would mean C is B. But AB is a diameter, so B is opposite A. So, C would be B, but EC is a diameter, so E and C are endpoints. If C is B, then E is opposite B. So, E is the point opposite B. But in this case, E would be the point such that BE is a diameter. But we also have ∠BO D, ∠DOE, etc. This might work, but I need to check if it fits the angle conditions.

Let me try this scenario: Assume arc AE is 180°, so E is opposite A. Then, since EC is a diameter, C is opposite E, so C is opposite to E, which is the same as being opposite to A, so C is B. But then EC is the diameter EB, which would mean that B is C. But the problem states that EC is a diameter, so E and C are distinct points. This implies that this scenario is invalid. Hence, arc AC cannot be 180°.

Another possibility: arc AC is made up of arc AF (90°) and arc FB. But I don't know arc FB. Alternatively, if arc AC is arc AD + arc DC. Let me think. 

If I can find the position of D and C, but without knowing where D is, it's hard. Let me try to use the angles given. 

From earlier, we had the angles at O: ∠BO D = 90°, ∠DOE = 90°, ∠EOF = 90°, ∠FOA = 90°. So, these angles add up to 360°, which means that the points B, D, E, F, A are placed such that each consecutive pair forms a 90° arc. 

Now, since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B is 180°. Let's say that the arc from A to B is composed of the arc from A to F to E to D to B? No, that would be 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which is the whole circle. So, the arc from A to B must be the other way, which is the arc from A to D to E to F to B? No, that would be the same. 

Wait, perhaps the arc from A to B is the combination of arc AF (90°) and arc FB. If arc AF is 90°, then arc FB would need to be 90° to make the total arc AB 180°. So, arc FB is 90°. But arc FB is from F to B. In our setup, the arc from F to B would be arc FE + ED + DB = 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°, which contradicts. 

This suggests that my assumption is wrong. Perhaps the arc from A to B is not passing through F, E, D, but instead through some other points. Let me consider that arc AB is composed of arc AF (90°) and arc FB, which is 90°,
