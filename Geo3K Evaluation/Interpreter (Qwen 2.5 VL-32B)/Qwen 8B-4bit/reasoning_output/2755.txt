MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pentagon EFGHJ with various angles given in terms of x, and we need to find the measure of angle H, which I think refers to angle at point G? Wait, wait. Wait, the angles mentioned are Angle(E,F,G), which would be angle at F, right? Because in angle ABC, it's the angle at B. So let me list out each angle:

The angles given are:

Angle(E,F,G) – so vertex at F. That's angle at F.

Then Angle(F,G,H) – vertex at G.

Angle(G,H,J) – vertex at H.

Angle(H,J,E) – vertex at J.

Angle(J,E,F) – vertex at E.

So the question asks for m∠H. Which would be the angle at H, which is Angle(G,H,J). Wait, because the angle at H would be formed by points G-H-J. So that's Angle(G,H,J). But according to the given predicates, there's an Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J)), Add(x,5)). Wait, but maybe I need to check if that's the case. Let me confirm.

Wait, the problem says "Find m∠H". In a pentagon, each vertex has one angle. So angle at H would be the internal angle at vertex H. Given the way the pentagon is defined with points E-F-G-H-J-E, so the vertices are E, F, G, H, J connected in order. Therefore, the internal angle at H is indeed Angle(G,H,J), since it's formed by sides FG to GH and HJ to HE? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In a polygon, each internal angle is formed by two adjacent sides. For example, in pentagon EFGHJ, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HJ, JE. So the internal angle at H would be between sides GH and HJ. So the angle at H is formed by points G, H, J. Therefore, the angle is ∠GHJ, which is Angle(G,H,J). So yes, that's the angle at H. And according to the given predicates, MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J)) = Add(x,5). So once we find x, we can compute that angle.

But first, we need to find x. The problem gives us equations involving the sum of all five angles of the pentagon equals 540 degrees. Since the sum of interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540, which checks out. So the sum of all these angles is 540. 

Let me write down all the expressions:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,G)) = x → angle at F is x.

MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H)) = x + 20 → angle at G is x+20.

MeasureOf(Angle(G,H,J)) = x +5 → angle at H is x+5.

MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,E)) = x -5 → angle at J is x-5.

MeasureOf(Angle(J,E,F)) = x +10 → angle at E is x+10.

So adding all these together:

x + (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 540.

Let me compute that:

Combine like terms:

x + x +20 +x +5 +x -5 +x +10.

Adding the x terms: 5x.

Adding constants: 20 +5 -5 +10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

So total sum is 5x +30 = 540.

Subtract 30: 5x = 510 → x=102.

Therefore, x is 102 degrees. Then, the measure of angle at H, which is x+5, is 102 +5 = 107 degrees. So the answer should be C, which is 107.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations. Let me re-calculate the sum:

Original sum:

x (angle E,F,G) 

plus (x+20) (F,G,H)

plus (x+5) (G,H,J)

plus (x-5) (H,J,E)

plus (x+10) (J,E,F)

Total sum: x + (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10).

Breaking down:

First term: x

Second: x +20

Third: x +5

Fourth: x -5

Fifth: x +10

Summing them:

x + x +20 +x +5 +x -5 +x +10 = 5x + (20 +5 -5 +10) = 5x + 30.

Yes, that's correct. So 5x +30 = 540 → 5x = 510 → x = 102. Then angle at H is x +5 = 107. So answer is C.
