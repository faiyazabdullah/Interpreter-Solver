MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

So, we have a rectangle EFGH. That means all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal and parallel. Points E, F, G, H are the vertices of the rectangle. Then there's point K, which is mentioned in several predicates. 

Looking at the lines: Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,E) form the sides of the rectangle. Also, Line(E,G) and Line(F,H) are diagonals? Wait, because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But here, they mention Line(E,G) and Line(F,H). Let me check if those are diagonals. Since EFGH is a rectangle, connecting E to G and F to H would indeed be the two diagonals. So EG and FH are diagonals of the rectangle. 

Then there are some RightAngle predicates. They state that angles at H, G, F, E are right angles. Which makes sense since it's a rectangle. So all four angles are right angles. 

Next, there's Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,G)), LengthOf(Line(F,H))). That's expected because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. 

Now, IsMidpointOf(Point(K), Line(E,G)) and IsMidpointOf(Point(K), Line(F,H)). Wait, so point K is the midpoint of both diagonals? In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so their midpoints are the same point. Therefore, K is the intersection point of the diagonals. So K is the center of the rectangle. 

Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), 32). And Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,H))). So FK equals KH. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,G)), Add(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,H)))). 

Let me try to visualize this. Since K is the midpoint of diagonal EG, then EK = KG. Similarly, K is the midpoint of FH, so FK = KH. So FK = KH implies that the length from F to K is equal to the length from K to H. 

But since FH is a diagonal, and K is its midpoint, then FK = KH = (FH)/2. So FH = 2*FK. But FH is equal to EG (since diagonals in a rectangle are equal). Therefore, EG = 2*FK. 

Wait, but the problem says that FK is 32 feet. So if EG = 2*FK, then EG = 2*32 = 64 feet. But wait, let me check again. 

Wait, the problem states that Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), 32). So FK is 32. Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,H))). So KH is also 32. Therefore, FH = FK + KH = 32 + 32 = 64. Since FH equals EG, then EG is 64. 

But wait, the answer options include D as 64. However, maybe there's more to consider here. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, and K is the midpoint. So EG and FH are diagonals, each split into two equal parts by K. Therefore, each half-diagonal is (diagonal length)/2. 

Given that FK = 32, and since K is the midpoint of FH, then FH = 2*FK = 64. Hence, EG = FH = 64. Therefore, the answer should be D. 

Wait, but why does the problem mention that FK equals KH? Well, that's redundant because K is the midpoint, so FK = KH automatically. So the fact that FK equals KH is just reinforcing that K is the midpoint. 

Therefore, the calculation seems straightforward. Given FK is 32, then FH is 64, hence EG is 64. So the answer is D. 

But let me double-check. Maybe there's another relationship. For example, could there be a right triangle involved? Let's think. Suppose we look at triangle FKH. Since FH is a diagonal, and K is the midpoint. But since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. 

Wait, but maybe there's a different way to compute EG. Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s assume E is at (0,0), F is at (a,0), G is at (a,b), H is at (0,b). Then the diagonals EG connects (0,0) to (a,b), and FH connects (a,0) to (0,b). The midpoint K of EG would be ((a/2), b/2). Similarly, midpoint of FH is ((a/2), b/2). So K is at (a/2, b/2). 

Then, the coordinates of F are (a,0), and K is (a/2, b/2). So the distance from F to K is sqrt[(a - a/2)^2 + (0 - b/2)^2] = sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2]. 

Similarly, the distance from K to H: H is at (0,b). So distance from K(a/2, b/2) to H(0,b) is sqrt[(a/2 - 0)^2 + (b/2 - b)^2] = sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (-b/2)^2], same as before. So FK = KH, which aligns with the given. 

But according to the problem, FK = 32. So sqrt[(a^2)/4 + (b^2)/4] = 32. Multiply both sides by 2: sqrt(a² + b²)/2 = 32 → sqrt(a² + b²) = 64. But the length of the diagonal EG is sqrt(a² + b²), which equals 64. So EG = 64. 

Thus, regardless of the sides a and b, the diagonal EG is 64. Therefore, the answer is D. 

Hmm, but looking at the answer choices, D is 64. So the answer should be D. But wait, the problem mentions that Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,G)), Add(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,H)))). Which is consistent because EG = FK + KH = 32 + 32 = 64. 

Yes, everything checks out. So the correct answer is D.
