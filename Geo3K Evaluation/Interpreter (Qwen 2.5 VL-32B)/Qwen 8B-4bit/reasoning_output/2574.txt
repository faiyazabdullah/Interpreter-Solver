MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle K, and points G, H, J, L. The problem says that GJ is a diameter of circle K. Then there are some arcs mentioned: Arc(G,H,J) measures 122 degrees, Arc(H,J,K) and Arc(G,L,J). Also, MeasureOf(Arc(G,J)) is 180 degrees. Wait, but since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J should be a semicircle, so 180 degrees. That checks out because the measure of a semicircle is always 180°, so that's consistent.

Now, the question is asking for the measure of arc GLJ. Let me visualize this. Points G, L, J are on the circle. Since GJ is a diameter, points G and J are at opposite ends of the circle. Point L is somewhere on the circumference, forming arc GLJ. But wait, arc GLJ would be the arc starting at G, going through L to J. Hmm, but how does that relate to other arcs?

We know that Arc(G,H,J) measures 122°. So that's the arc from G to J passing through H. Since the total measure around a circle is 360°, and the arc GJ through H is 122°, then the rest of the circle would be 360° - 122° = 238°, but that's the major arc? Wait, no. Wait, if GJ is a diameter, then the entire circle is split into two semicircles. Wait, but the arc G to J through H is 122°, which is less than 180°, so that suggests that point H is somewhere on one side of the diameter GJ. Wait, but if GJ is a diameter, then the arc from G to J along the shorter path would be 180°, but here the arc G-H-J is 122°, which is shorter than 180°, so that means H is on the same side as the minor arc GJ. Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally.

Let me sketch it out. Imagine circle K with diameter GJ. So points G and J are at opposite ends. Now, there's an arc from G to H to J measuring 122°, which implies that H is somewhere on the circumference such that moving from G to H to J covers 122°. Therefore, the arc GH plus arc HJ equals 122°. But since GJ is a straight line (diameter), the total arc length from G to J directly is 180°, so the sum of arc GH and arc HJ is 122°, which is part of the semicircle. Wait, but that doesn't make sense unless H is inside the semicircle. Alternatively, perhaps the arc G-H-J refers to the arc that goes from G to J via H, which could be either the minor or major arc depending on where H is. However, since the measure is 122°, which is less than 180°, that suggests that H lies on the same semicircle as the diameter GJ. 

Wait, but if GJ is a diameter, then the arc from G to J that doesn't pass through H would be the major arc? No, the major arc would be longer than 180°, but the minor arc is 180°. Wait, but the arc G-H-J is measured as 122°, so that's the arc from G to J passing through H. So that arc is 122°, which is less than 180°, meaning that H is located on the same side of the diameter GJ as the minor arc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Since GJ is a diameter, the entire circle is divided into two semicircles each of 180°. If the arc from G to J through H is 122°, that must mean that H is on the same semicircle as the diameter GJ. So, starting at G, going counterclockwise through H to J, covering 122°, which is less than the full semicircle. Therefore, the arc from G to J through H is 122°, implying that the remaining part of the semicircle (from H back to G) would be 180° - 122° = 58°. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, if the arc G-H-J is 122°, then that's the measure of the arc from G to J passing through H. So, that arc is 122°, which is part of the circle. But since GJ is a diameter, the total measure of the circle is 360°, so the arc from G to J through the other side (the major arc) would be 360° - 122° = 238°, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

But the problem also mentions another arc: Arc(H,J,K). Wait, point K is also a point on the circle? Wait, looking back, the initial predicates mention Point(K), but then the circle is called ⊙K. So, point K is the center of the circle. Because in standard notation, a circle is named by its center, so ⊙K would mean the circle with center K. Wait, but earlier it was stated that IsDiameterOf(Line(G,J), Circle(K)), so Line(G,J) is a diameter of circle K. Therefore, point K is the center of the circle. So, point K is the center, and points G and J are endpoints of the diameter. Therefore, the radius of the circle is half of GJ, but maybe we don't need that.

So, the arc HJK: Arc(H,J,K). Wait, but point K is the center, so is that an arc from H to J to K? Or is it an arc from H to J, with K being a label? Wait, the notation Arc(H,J,K) might mean an arc from H to K passing through J? Or perhaps it's an arc from H to J with K being another point on the arc? Wait, the way it's written as Arc(H,J,K) might imply that the arc starts at H, ends at K, and passes through J. But that seems odd because K is the center. Wait, but points on a circle are typically labeled with letters like G, H, J, L, etc., so K is the center. Therefore, K is not on the circumference. Therefore, Arc(H,J,K) would not make sense because K is the center, not a point on the circle. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the predicate names? Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back, the user wrote:

"Predicates:
Circle(K)
Point(G)
Point(H)
Point(J)
Point(L)
Point(K)
IsDiameterOf(Line(G,J), Circle(K))
Arc(G,H,J)
Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(G,H,J)), 122)
Arc(H,J,K)
Arc(G,L,J)
Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(G,J)), 180)"

Ah! So, the Arc(H,J,K) is an arc from H to K, passing through J? But K is the center, which is not on the circle. Wait, that can't be. Unless there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is supposed to be an arc from H to J with K being a different point? Wait, but the points listed are G, H, J, L, K. Wait, K is a point, but since it's the center of the circle, it's not on the circumference. Therefore, arcs are defined between points on the circumference. So Arc(H,J,K) would require that K is on the circumference. But according to the given data, K is the center. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in labeling. For example, perhaps the circle is named ⊙K, where K is the center, and there's another point K? No, the problem states:

"Point(K)" is given, so K is a point. Then Circle(K) is the circle with center K. So, K is the center. Therefore, K is not on the circumference. Therefore, arcs cannot involve K as an endpoint. Hence, the Arc(H,J,K) must be a typo or misinterpretation. Wait, perhaps it's a typo and meant to be Arc(H,J,L)? Or Arc(H,J,G)? Alternatively, maybe the arc is from H to J with some other point? Or maybe the arc is from H to K, but K isn't on the circle. This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Arc(H,J,K) refers to an arc from H to J, with K being the center, but that wouldn't be a standard arc notation. In standard terms, arcs are between two points on the circumference. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, but assuming that the Arc(H,J,K) is intended to be an arc from H to J, and K is just a label for the circle. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the Arc(H,J,K) is supposed to be Arc(H,J,L), and there's a typo. Given that the problem includes point L, which is used in the question about arc GLJ, maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is actually Arc(H,J,L)? Or maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is referring to something else.

This confusion complicates things. Let me focus on the parts that make sense. We know that GJ is a diameter, so the arc from G to J is 180°, which matches the given Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(G,J)), 180). The Arc(G,H,J) has measure 122°, so that's the arc from G to J passing through H, which is 122°, meaning that H is somewhere on the circle such that the arc from G to H to J is 122°. Therefore, the arc from G to H plus arc from H to J equals 122°. But since GJ is a diameter, the total arc from G to J is 180°, so the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which would mean that the arc from G to J through the other side (not passing through H) is 180°, but that's not helpful yet.

Then, there's Arc(G,L,J). The question asks for the measure of arc GLJ, which is likely the arc from G to J passing through L. So, the measure of arc GLJ would be the measure of the arc from G to J that goes through L. To find that, we need to determine where L is located.

Given that there's also an Arc(H,J,K), but since K is the center, that seems problematic. Maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is supposed to be Arc(H,J,G)? Or another point. Assuming that the Arc(H,J,K) is a typo and should be Arc(H,J,L), which would make sense. Or maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is referring to an arc from H to J, with K being the center, but that's not a standard arc. Alternatively, perhaps it's an arc from H to J, and the measure is determined by some relationship.

Alternatively, maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is meant to be Arc(H,J,G), but without more info, it's hard to tell. Let me see what else we know. The problem mentions point L, and the question is about arc GLJ. So, maybe we need to use the given arcs to find the position of L.

Assuming that the Arc(G,L,J) is the arc from G to J passing through L. So, the measure of that arc is what we need to find. Let me consider the circle with diameter GJ. The total circumference is 360°, so the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°. We know that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, so that's one arc. The arc from G to J through L is what we're trying to find. Additionally, there's the arc from H to J (part of the 122° arc) and possibly others.

Wait, but if GJ is a diameter, then the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which is less than 180°, so that suggests that H is on the same semicircle as the diameter. Therefore, the arc from H to J would be 122° minus arc from G to H. Wait, but we don't know the individual measures of those arcs. However, maybe we can find them.

Let me denote the measure of arc GH as x, and arc HJ as y. Then x + y = 122°. Since GJ is a diameter, the entire semicircle is 180°, so the arc from G to J through the other side (not passing through H) would be 180°, which is the major arc? No, the major arc would be the longer arc. Wait, if the arc from G to J through H is 122°, then the other arc from G to J (through the other direction) is 180°, which would be the semicircle. Wait, but that doesn't add up. Wait, the total circle is 360°, so the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and the arc from G to J through the other side is 360° - 122° = 238°, which is the major arc. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J directly (without going around the other side) is 180°, so that must mean that the arc through H is the minor arc, which is 122°, and the other arc is the major arc of 238°. Wait, but that contradicts the fact that GJ is a diameter, making the minor arc between G and J exactly 180°. So there's inconsistency here.

Wait, that suggests a contradiction. If GJ is a diameter, then the arc from G to J should be exactly 180°, regardless of the path taken. But the given arc G-H-J measures 122°, which is less than 180°, which would imply that the arc from G to J through H is the minor arc, but that's impossible because the minor arc between two endpoints of a diameter should be 180°. Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the arc G-H-J is not the minor arc, but rather the arc from G to J passing through H, which could be a major arc. Wait, but the measure is given as 122°, which is less than 180°, so that would be the minor arc. But since G and J are endpoints of a diameter, the minor arc between them should be exactly 180°. This seems contradictory. What's wrong here?

Perhaps the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but from G to H to J, meaning that H is a point on the circle such that the arc from G to H plus arc from H to J equals 122°, but since GJ is a diameter, the total arc from G to J should be 180°, so that would mean that the arc from G to H plus arc from H to J equals 180°, but the given measure is 122°, which suggests that the arc G-H-J is actually a portion of the semicircle. This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but an arc that starts at G, goes through H, and ends at J. Which would mean that the measure of that arc is 122°, so the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which would suggest that the arc from G to J not passing through H is 360° - 122° = 238°, but since G and J are diametrically opposite, the arc between them should be 180°, not 238°. Therefore, this indicates that there's an error in the problem setup or in my interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but the arc from G to H to J, meaning that H is a point on the circle such that the arc from G to H is some measure, and from H to J is another. But since GJ is a diameter, the total arc from G to J should be 180°, so the sum of arc GH and arc HJ is 180°, but the problem says that the measure of arc G-H-J is 122°, which would mean that the arc GH + HJ = 122°, which contradicts the fact that they should add to 180°. So this is a contradiction, suggesting that either the problem is ill-posed or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the arc G-H-J refers to an arc that starts at G, goes through H, and ends at J, but it's not necessarily the arc that connects G to J. Wait, but arcs are defined between two points, so arc G-H-J would typically mean the arc from G to J passing through H. So if that's the case, then the measure of that arc is 122°, which would imply that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which should be the minor arc, but since GJ is a diameter, the minor arc should be 180°. Hence, this suggests a conflict.

This seems like a critical issue. Perhaps the arc G-H-J is not the minor arc but the major arc? But the measure is 122°, which is less than 180°, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the arc G-H-J is not the arc between G and J, but another arc. Wait, maybe the arc is from G to H to J, but H is not on the circle? No, H is a point on the circle, as per the predicate Point(H).

At this point, I'm stuck due to the inconsistency in the given data. However, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that there's a typo, and that the arc G-H-J is actually the arc from G to H to J, which is part of the semicircle. Let's try to move forward with that.

Assume that the arc from G to H to J is 122°, which would mean that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, so the arc GH + arc HJ = 122°. Since GJ is a diameter, the total arc from G to J should be 180°, so the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°. Wait, but that would mean that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and through the other side is 180°, which would make the total circle 122° + 180° = 302°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc G-H-J is the major arc? But 122° is still less than 180°. This is very confusing.

Maybe the key is to ignore the arc G-H-J and focus on other information. The problem also mentions Arc(G,L,J), which is the arc from G to J passing through L, which is what we're asked to find. Let's assume that the arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L, and we need to find its measure.

If we can find the measure of arc GLJ, then we can determine the answer. Let's consider that the total circle is 360°, and we have several arcs:

- Arc G-H-J: 122°
- Arc G-J: 180° (since GJ is a diameter)
- Arc G-L-J: ?

But since the arc G-H-J is part of the circle, and arc G-L-J is another arc from G to J, passing through L. Depending on where L is, these could overlap or be separate.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ is composed of other arcs. For example, if we know the measure of arc G-H-J is 122°, and if we can find the measure of arc HLJ or something else, we can compute the desired arc.

But without knowing where L is, it's difficult. However, since there's an Arc(H,J,K), which we previously thought might be a typo, perhaps it's Arc(H,J,L)? If that's the case, then we might have more information.

Assuming that Arc(H,J,K) is Arc(H,J,L), then we might have an arc from H to J passing through L. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is referring to an arc from H to J, which is part of the circle, and K is the center, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the Arc(H,J,K) is referring to an arc from H to J, and K is the center, but since K is not on the circle, that arc would be undefined. This seems like a dead end.

Perhaps the problem has a mistake, but given that it's presented as solvable, I'll proceed with the assumption that the arc G-H-J is 122°, and that the arc from G to J through L is what we need to find, and that the other arcs are part of the circle.

Let me try to imagine the circle with diameter GJ. Let's say we have point H on the circle such that the arc from G to H to J is 122°. This means that the arc from G to H is x, and from H to J is y, where x + y = 122°. Since GJ is a diameter, the total arc from G to J is 180°, so x + y = 180°, but the given is x + y = 122°, which is a contradiction. This suggests that there's an error in the problem, but perhaps the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but another arc.

Wait, maybe the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but an arc from G to H to J, meaning that H is a point on the circle, and the arc from G to H is one part, and from H to J is another, but the total measure is 122°. But how does that relate to the rest?

Alternatively, perhaps the arc G-H-J refers to an arc that starts at G, goes to H, and then to J, forming a larger arc. But that's unclear.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress due to inconsistencies, perhaps I should look for alternative approaches. Let's consider that the arc GLJ is what we need to find, and that GJ is a diameter. So, if L is a point on the circle, then the arc GLJ would depend on where L is located.

Another approach: since GJ is a diameter, any angle subtended by GJ at the circumference would be a right angle. But the question is about the measure of arc GLJ, not an angle. Wait, but if we can find the position of L relative to G and J, we can determine the arc measure.

Suppose we consider the arc GLJ. If L is positioned such that it forms an inscribed angle with GJ, but without more information, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but there's another arc mentioned: Arc(G,L,J). If that's the arc from G to J passing through L, then its measure depends on where L is. If we can find the measure of this arc, we can determine the answer.

Let me think: the total circumference is 360°. We know that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, but this is conflicting. However, if we assume that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, then the rest of the circle (excluding that arc) would be 360° - 122° = 238°. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, which would mean that the remaining part of the circle (238°) consists of other arcs.

But this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, if we consider that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, then the arc from J to G through H is the same, and the rest of the circle is 360° - 122° = 238°, which would include other arcs.

However, without knowing where L is, it's challenging to determine the arc GLJ. But perhaps there's a relation between the given arcs. For example, if there's an arc from H to J, and another arc from H to L, but this is speculation.

Alternatively, since the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and GJ is a diameter, then the arc from G to H is 122° minus the arc from H to J. But without knowing where H is, this is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which means that the arc from G to H is part of that 122°, and similarly, the arc from H to J is the remainder. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180°, so if the arc from G to J through H is 122°, then the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, which would imply that the arc from G to H plus arc from H to J is 122°, and the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, so the total circle would be 122° + 180° = 302°, which is not possible. This contradiction suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, but since it's given, I must work with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc G-H-J is not the arc from G to J, but an arc from G to H to J, which is a different arc. For example, if H is a point on the circle, then the arc from G to H is x, and from H to J is y, totaling 122°. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, so the total circle would be 122° + 180° = 302°, which is still impossible.

At this point, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that there's a typo and that the arc G-H-J is actually the arc from G to J, which should be 180°, but it's given as 122°, which suggests that the arc is not the standard one. Maybe the arc G-H-J is a reflex angle? But reflex angles are greater than 180°, and the given measure is 122°, which is less.

This is very confusing. Perhaps the key is to focus on the arc GLJ. Since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180°. If L is a point on the circle, then the arc from G to J through L would be either 180° (if L is on the diameter) or something else. But without knowing where L is, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but there's another arc mentioned: Arc(G,L,J). If that's the arc from G to J passing through L, then its measure depends on where L is. If we can find the measure of this arc, we can determine the answer.

But how? Let's consider that the total circle is 360°, and we know one arc is 122°, and another arc is 180°. If these arcs overlap or are parts of the circle, we might find the missing arc.

For example, if the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and the arc from G to J through L is what we need, then the difference between these arcs might give us information about L's position.

But without knowing where L is, this is challenging. Perhaps there's another arc mentioned: Arc(H,J,K). If K is the center, and assuming it's a typo for another point, like Arc(H,J,L), then we might have more information.

Assuming Arc(H,J,K) is Arc(H,J,L), then we have arc from H to J passing through L. Let's say that arc measure is z. But without knowing z, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, if Arc(H,J,K) is an arc from H to J, which is part of the circle, and since GJ is a diameter, the arc from H to J would be part of the 122° arc or the 180° arc. 

This is too vague. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll try to make an educated guess. Since the arc from G to J is 180°, and there's an arc from G to J through H of 122°, the remaining arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, so the arc from H to J through the other side would be 180° - arc from G to H. But without knowing arc GH, it's hard.

Wait, if the arc from G to H to J is 122°, then the arc from G to H is x and from H to J is y, with x + y = 122°. The arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, which would be the arc from G to J not passing through H. This arc would consist of arc from G to H through the other side plus arc from H to J through the other side. But this is too many variables.

Alternatively, if the arc from G to J through H is 122°, then the arc from G to J through the other side is 360° - 122° = 238°, which is not possible since GJ is a diameter. This suggests that the arc G-H-J is actually the major arc, but 122° is still less than 180°, so this doesn't hold.

I think I'm stuck here. Given that the problem is from a standardized test or similar, perhaps the answer is 120°, which is option B. Here's why: if the arc from G to J through H is 122°, and the arc from G to J through L is what we need, and if there's a relationship between these arcs, maybe the arc GLJ is supplementary to 122°, giving 180° - 122° = 58°, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if the arc from G to J through L is the supplement of the arc from H to J, but this is guessing.

Alternatively, since GJ is a diameter, and if L is such that arc GLJ is twice the arc from G to H, but without knowing where L is, it's hard.

Wait, let's try one last approach. Assume that the arc from G to J through H is 122°, which means that the arc from G to H is x and from H to J is y, with x + y = 122°. The arc from G to J through the other side is 180°, so the arc from G to J through the other side is the sum of arc from G to H through the other side plus arc from H to J through the other side. But without knowing where H is, this is not helpful.

If we assume that point L is such that the arc from G to L to J is the supplement of the arc from G to H to J, then 360° - 122° = 238°, which is not an option. Alternatively, if the arc from G to L to J is the arc from G to J through L, which is the major arc, but since GJ is a diameter, the major arc would be 180°, which is not possible.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and am unable to resolve the inconsistency in the problem statement. However, given that the arc from G to J is 180°, and there's an arc from G to H to J of 122°, the remaining arc from H to J would be 180° - 122° = 58°, but I'm not sure how this helps. If point L is placed such that it completes the circle, but without more information, I can't determine the measure.

Given the options, and if I assume that the arc GLJ is the major arc, which would be 360° - 122° = 238°, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if it's the minor arc, but that would be 180°, which is option C. But the problem states that the arc from G to J is 180°, so maybe the arc GLJ is the same as that, making the answer C. But this feels forced.

Alternatively, if the arc GLJ is the arc from G to J through L, which is the same as the arc from G to J, which is 180°, so the answer would be C. But this assumes that L is on the diameter, which may not be the case.

Given the uncertainty, but needing to choose from the options, I'll go with option B: 120°, as it's a common angle in such problems, but this is a guess. Alternatively, if the arc from G to J through L is the supplement of the arc from G to H to J, then 180° - 122° = 58°, which is not an option. Hence, I'm really stuck.

Wait, another idea: since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180°. The arc from G to H to J is 122°, so the arc from H to J is 122° - arc from G to H. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180°, so if we can find the arc from H to J, we can relate it to the arc from G to H.

But without knowing where H is, this is not helpful. Suppose the arc from H to J is 122°, then the arc from G to H would be 180° - 122° = 58°. If L is placed such that it creates an arc from G to L to J that is twice the arc from G to H, which would be 116°, but this is speculation.

Alternatively, if the arc from G to L to J is the supplement of the arc from H to J, then 180° - 122° = 58°, but again, not matching options.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll make an educated guess and choose option B: 120°, as it's a common angle in circle problems involving arcs and diameters.
