====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have a parallelogram ABCD. The points A, B, C, D are all points, and there are lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DA. Also, there's a point E connected via line CE. 

Given that it's a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal and parallel. The predicates mention that AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DA. Also, the lengths of AB and CD are both 13 units, while BC and DA are 15 units each. That checks out with the properties of a parallelogram where opposite sides are equal.

Now, there's a triangle BCE mentioned. Point E is connected to B and C, forming triangle BEC. Also, there's a right angle at E, specifically Angle CEB is a right angle. Additionally, line CE is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is one of the sides of the parallelogram, and CE is perpendicular to AB, that suggests CE is the height of the parallelogram relative to base AB. 

Wait, because in a parallelogram, the area can be calculated as base times height. So if I can find the length of CE, which is the height corresponding to base AB (which is 13 units), then multiplying them would give the area. Alternatively, since the sides are 13 and 15, maybe there's another way using trigonometry? But perhaps the right triangle here gives us the height directly.

Looking at triangle BEC, which is a right triangle at E. Given that BC is 15 units (from the given length of BC), and BE is 5 units (as per the equality). Wait, but in triangle BEC, BE is one leg, EC is another leg, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but according to the given, the square of EC equals the square of BC minus the square of BE. Let me check that. 

The predicate says Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,E))), Sub(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E))))) ). So substituting the numbers: Square of EC = Square of BC (which is 15²) minus Square of BE (which is 5²). Therefore, EC² = 225 - 25 = 200. Then EC = sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2). Hmm, so EC is 10√2. 

But wait, since CE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is the base of the parallelogram, then CE is the height. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram would be base AB multiplied by height CE. AB is 13, CE is 10√2. Multiplying these: 13 * 10√2 = 130√2. But let me compute that numerically. √2 ≈ 1.4142, so 130 * 1.4142 ≈ 130 * 1.4142. Let me calculate that. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Because CE isn't necessarily the height of the entire parallelogram. Wait, CE is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is a side of the parallelogram, then yes, CE is the height corresponding to base AB. So the area would indeed be AB * CE. 

But let me confirm. In a parallelogram, the area is base times height. Here, AB is the base, length 13. The height is the distance between the two bases AB and CD. Since CE is perpendicular to AB, and E lies somewhere... Wait, but how do we know that CE is the height? Because if CE is perpendicular to AB, then the length of CE would be the height. However, point E is part of triangle BEC, so maybe E is located such that CE is the height. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since triangle BEC is right-angled at E, with BE=5, BC=15, then EC can be found via Pythagoras. As above, EC = sqrt(BC² - BE²) = sqrt(225 - 25) = sqrt(200) = 10√2. So EC is 10√2. Thus, the height h = 10√2. Then area = base * height = 13 * 10√2 = 130√2. Calculating this value numerically: √2 ≈ 1.4142, so 130 * 1.4142 ≈ 183.846. Rounding to the nearest tenth would be approximately 183.8. Looking at the answer choices: A is 165, B is 180, C is 195, D is 210. None of these exactly match 183.8, but maybe I made a miscalculation?

Wait, hold on. Maybe my assumption that CE is the height is incorrect. Let me think again. The line CE is perpendicular to AB. However, in the parallelogram ABCD, AB is horizontal (assuming standard position), and CE is perpendicular to AB, so vertical. But point E is connected to C and B. How does E lie in relation to the parallelogram? 

Alternatively, perhaps the height is not CE, but something else. Let me consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let’s place point A at (0,0). Since AB is length 13, and assuming AB is along x-axis, then point B is at (13,0). Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB is (13,0). Vector AD should be equal to vector BC. Wait, but BC has length 15. Let me think. Coordinates may help here.

Alternatively, since BC is length 15 and AB is 13. Also, since CE is perpendicular to AB. Let me assign coordinates more carefully.

Let’s fix coordinate system:

Let me set point A at (0,0). Let me assume AB is along x-axis, so point B is at (13,0). Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB is (13,0), so vector DC is also (13,0). Now, point D is connected to A and C. Let me denote coordinates for D as (x,y), then since AD is length 15, so distance from A(0,0) to D(x,y) is sqrt(x² + y²) = 15. Similarly, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AD equals vector BC. Vector BC is from B(13,0) to C. Let me denote point C as (13 + x, y), since vector BC would be same as AD. Wait, in a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC. 

So, if AB is (13,0), then DC must also be (13,0). So point D is (a,b), then point C is (a+13, b). Also, since AD is from A(0,0) to D(a,b), so its length squared is a² + b² = 15² = 225. 

Then BC is from B(13,0) to C(a+13, b), so vector BC is (a, b), which has length sqrt(a² + b²) = 15, which matches. 

Now, point E is connected to C and forms a right angle at E with line CE perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, CE must be vertical. So line CE is vertical, hence has undefined slope. Therefore, CE is vertical, so point E must lie somewhere along the vertical line passing through C. 

But CE is perpendicular to AB, which is horizontal. Therefore, CE is vertical. So point E has the same x-coordinate as point C. Let me denote coordinates of C as (c_x, c_y). Then E is (c_x, e_y) for some e_y. 

Also, triangle BEC is right-angled at E. So, points B(13,0), E(c_x, e_y), C(c_x, c_y). Let me write coordinates:

Point B is (13,0).

Point C is (c_x, c_y).

Point E is (c_x, e_y). 

Since CE is vertical, from C(c_x, c_y) to E(c_x, e_y). So the length of CE is |c_y - e_y|.

In triangle BEC, right-angled at E. So BE is from B(13,0) to E(c_x, e_y). The length of BE is given as 5. 

So the distance between B(13,0) and E(c_x, e_y) is 5. 

So sqrt[(c_x - 13)^2 + (e_y - 0)^2] = 5 → (c_x -13)^2 + e_y^2 = 25. 

Also, since BC is length 15, which is the distance between B(13,0) and C(c_x, c_y):

sqrt[(c_x -13)^2 + (c_y - 0)^2] = 15 → (c_x -13)^2 + c_y^2 = 225. 

Subtracting the equation from BE's equation: [(c_x -13)^2 + c_y^2] - [(c_x -13)^2 + e_y^2] = 225 - 25 → c_y^2 - e_y^2 = 200 → (c_y - e_y)(c_y + e_y) = 200. 

But CE is the length |c_y - e_y|. Let me denote that as h, the height. So h = |c_y - e_y|. Then, from the previous equation, h*(2e_y) ? Wait, no. Wait, if I let d = c_y - e_y, then d * (c_y + e_y) = 200. But unless I know something about e_y, this might not help directly. 

However, since CE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is horizontal, CE is vertical. Therefore, the length of CE is |d|, which is the height of the parallelogram. Because the height corresponding to base AB is the vertical distance between AB and CD. Since AB is at y=0, and CD is at y=c_y (since point C is (c_x, c_y) and D is (c_x -13, c_y)? Wait, earlier I said point D is (a,b), and point C is (a +13, b). Wait, earlier variables were getting confusing. Let me re-express.

Earlier, I considered that in the parallelogram ABCD, vectors AB and DC are equal. So if AB is from A(0,0) to B(13,0), then DC should be the same vector. So point D is (p, q), and point C is D + AB vector, so (p +13, q). Then, vector AD is from A(0,0) to D(p,q), so length sqrt(p² + q²) = 15. Vector BC is from B(13,0) to C(p+13, q), which is (p, q), same as vector AD, so length sqrt(p² + q²)=15. 

Therefore, coordinates:

A(0,0)

B(13,0)

D(p, q)

C(p+13, q)

Now, line CE is vertical (since it's perpendicular to AB). Point C is (p+13, q), so line CE is vertical line x = p+13. Therefore, point E is (p+13, e_y). 

Then, BE is the segment from B(13,0) to E(p+13, e_y). Length of BE is 5. So:

Distance between (13,0) and (p+13, e_y) is sqrt[(p+13 -13)^2 + (e_y - 0)^2] = sqrt[p² + e_y²] = 5. Hence, p² + e_y² = 25. 

Also, BC is from B(13,0) to C(p+13, q): distance is sqrt[ (p+13 -13)^2 + (q - 0)^2 ] = sqrt[p² + q²] = 15. Hence, p² + q² = 225. 

From the first equation: p² + e_y² = 25. Subtracting from second equation: (p² + q²) - (p² + e_y²) = 225 - 25 ⇒ q² - e_y² = 200 ⇒ (q - e_y)(q + e_y) = 200. 

But CE is the length from C(p+13, q) to E(p+13, e_y), which is |q - e_y|. So that's the height h = |q - e_y|. 

Thus, h * (q + e_y) = 200. But without knowing q + e_y, we can't directly get h. However, note that in the parallelogram, the height corresponding to base AB is h. Since AB is the base of length 13, the area is 13 * h. 

But how to find h? We need to express h in terms of known quantities. 

We have from the equation: (q - e_y)(q + e_y) = 200. Let me denote h = |q - e_y|. Assuming that q > e_y (since CE is going downward from C to E?), then h = q - e_y. So then, h * (q + e_y) = 200. 

But we don't know q or e_y individually. However, we can find q from the earlier equations. From p² + q² = 225, and p² + e_y² = 25. Subtracting gives q² - e_y² = 200. Which is the same as before. 

But we need another relationship. Let me see. What else do we know? The fact that ABCD is a parallelogram, so coordinates are consistent. Also, the line CE is perpendicular to AB, which we already used. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, the triangle BEC is right-angled at E. So in triangle BEC, with right angle at E, BE = 5, BC = 15, and CE = h. So by Pythagoras: BE² + CE² = BC² → 5² + h² = 15² → 25 + h² = 225 → h² = 200 → h = sqrt(200) = 10√2 ≈ 14.142. 

Wait! This seems like the key. Earlier, I thought that EC was the height, but this calculation shows that EC is h = sqrt(200). Wait, but according to the given predicate, the square of EC equals the square of BC minus square of BE. Which is exactly what we just did. So EC² = BC² - BE² = 225 - 25 = 200 → EC = sqrt(200). Therefore, the height h is sqrt(200). 

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is base AB (13) multiplied by height h (sqrt(200)). So area = 13 * sqrt(200). 

Compute sqrt(200): sqrt(100*2) = 10√2 ≈ 14.142. Multiply by 13: 13 * 14.142 ≈ 183.846. 

Looking at the options: A. 165, B. 180, C. 195, D. 210. The closest is B. 180. But wait, is there a mistake here? Or maybe I missed something?

Alternatively, perhaps the height isn't h = sqrt(200), but instead the height is different. Wait, why did we use Pythagoras here? Because triangle BEC is right-angled at E, so BE and EC are legs, and BC is hypotenuse. Therefore, yes, BE² + EC² = BC². So EC² = BC² - BE² = 225 - 25 = 200. Hence, EC = sqrt(200). Therefore, the height of the parallelogram is sqrt(200). Therefore, area is 13 * sqrt(200). 

Calculate that precisely: sqrt(200) = 10√2 ≈ 14.1421. Multiply by 13: 14.1421 * 13. Let me compute that:

14 * 13 = 182, 0.1421*13 ≈ 1.8473. Total ≈ 182 + 1.8473 ≈ 183.8473. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 183.8. 

But none of the options is 183.8. The options are A. 165, B. 180, C. 195, D. 210. So the closest is B. 180. But why isn't there an exact match? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the area formula. Is EC indeed the height? Because EC is perpendicular to AB, so yes, EC is the height. But wait, in the coordinate setup, the height would be the vertical distance between AB (y=0) and CD (which is at y=q). So the height is q. Wait, but earlier I thought EC is the height. But in reality, the height is q, and EC is part of that. 

Hold on, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. 

In the coordinate system, AB is from (0,0) to (13,0). The line CD is from point D(p,q) to C(p+13, q). Therefore, the y-coordinate of CD is q. Hence, the height of the parallelogram is q. But CE is the vertical segment from C(p+13, q) down to E(p+13, e_y). So the length of CE is q - e_y, which is part of the total height q. Unless E is at the base of the parallelogram. Wait, but why is E positioned such that CE is the height? 

Ah! Wait, because CE is perpendicular to AB, but E could be anywhere along the line perpendicular to AB through C. However, the triangle BEC being right-angled at E implies that E lies on the line perpendicular to AB at C? No, it's perpendicular to AB, so vertical line through C. 

But the height of the parallelogram is the distance between AB and CD, which is q. But EC is a segment from C down to E, which is along the vertical line. So unless E is at the base, but that depends on where E is. 

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, EC is sqrt(200), which would mean that q - e_y = sqrt(200). But if the total height is q, then how does that relate? 

Wait, but in that case, the height of the parallelogram is q, and EC is part of that. So unless E coincides with D or something. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the height. Let me think differently. The area of the parallelogram can also be computed as base * height, where height is the distance between the two bases. If AB is the base, then the height is the perpendicular distance from AB to CD. Since AB is horizontal, the y-coordinate difference between AB (at y=0) and CD (at y=q) is q. So the height is q. 

But earlier, we found that EC = sqrt(200) = q - e_y. So unless e_y = 0, which would make EC = q, making the height q. But in that case, e_y = 0 would mean that E is at (p+13, 0), which is the same as point B? No, point B is at (13,0). If E is at (p+13, 0), then if p+13 =13, then p=0. But then point D would be (p,q) = (0,q), and point C would be (0+13, q) = (13,q). So then, ABCD would have points A(0,0), B(13,0), C(13,q), D(0,q). Which is a rectangle if q is arbitrary. But in this case, BC would be from (13,0) to (13,q), length q. But in the problem, BC is length 15. So q=15. Then EC would be from C(13,15) to E(13,0), which is length 15. But the given BE is 5. But BE would be from B(13,0) to E(13,0), which is zero. Contradiction. So that scenario doesn't fit. 

Therefore, E cannot be at y=0. So EC is not the full height q. Instead, EC is a part of the height. So how do we connect this? 

We had earlier that EC = sqrt(200) = q - e_y. And from the equation q² - e_y² = 200. Which factors into (q - e_y)(q + e_y) = 200. We know q - e_y = sqrt(200), so substitute:

sqrt(200) * (q + e_y) = 200 → q + e_y = 200 / sqrt(200) = sqrt(200). 

So q + e_y = sqrt(200). And we also have q - e_y = sqrt(200). Adding these two equations:

(q - e_y) + (q + e_y) = 2q = 2*sqrt(200) → q = sqrt(200). 

Therefore, q = sqrt(200). Therefore, the height of the parallelogram is q = sqrt(200). Hence, area is base AB (13) multiplied by height q (sqrt(200)) → 13 * sqrt(200). 

Which is the same as before. So the area is 13 * sqrt(200). Let me compute this value numerically. 

sqrt(200) is approximately 14.1421. So 13 * 14.1421 ≈ 183.847. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 183.8. 

Looking at the answer choices, none of them are exactly 183.8. However, the options are A. 165, B. 180, C. 195, D. 210. 

This suggests that either there's a miscalculation, or perhaps the question expects using integer approximations. Wait, let me compute 13 * sqrt(200) more accurately. 

Alternatively, sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2). So 13 * 10 * sqrt(2) = 130√2. Let me calculate 130√2. 

√2 ≈ 1.41421356. So 130 * 1.41421356 ≈ ?

Calculate 100 * 1.41421356 = 141.421356

30 * 1.41421356 = 42.4264068

Total ≈ 141.421356 + 42.4264068 ≈ 183.8477628. So approximately 183.85. 

Rounded to the nearest tenth is 183.8. 

But the answer choices don't have this. So why is that? Did I misinterpret something?

Wait, maybe the height isn't q but something else. Let me think again. 

Because in the coordinate system, the height of the parallelogram is q, which we found to be sqrt(200). So area is 13 * sqrt(200). But sqrt(200) is 10√2, so area is 130√2. Let me compute 130√2 numerically again. 

√2 ≈ 1.41421356

130 × 1.41421356 = 130 × 1.4142 ≈ 130 × 1.4142 = 183.846. 

Still, the answer options don't include this. Perhaps the question assumes that CE is the height, but there's a miscalculation in that assumption?

Wait, let me think: if EC is the height, then area is base AB × EC = 13 × sqrt(200). But maybe the question considers the height as BE? No, BE is 5, which is too small. 

Alternatively, maybe the area is calculated using the other pair of sides? For example, in a parallelogram, area can also be calculated as product of adjacent sides times sine of the included angle. 

Let me explore this. Let’s say the sides are AB = 13 and BC = 15. The area is AB × BC × sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and BC. 

But how to find theta? Well, in triangle BEC, right-angled at E, with BE = 5, BC = 15, and EC = sqrt(200). So in triangle BEC, angle at B is angle between BE and BC. Wait, but how does that relate to the angle of the parallelogram?

Alternatively, since CE is perpendicular to AB, which means that the angle between AB and CE is 90 degrees. But CE is part of the triangle BEC. 

Alternatively, since CE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is one side of the parallelogram, then the height of the parallelogram is EC. Wait, but earlier calculations showed that EC is sqrt(200), leading to area 13 * sqrt(200). 

Is there a possibility that the question wants the area using the other pair of sides? Like base BC and height corresponding to it? 

For instance, if we take BC as the base (length 15), then the height would be the distance from A to BC. But how to find that? 

Alternatively, using the area formula as base × height. Since we've already determined the area as 13 * sqrt(200), which is approximately 183.8, and the closest option is B. 180. But why isn't there an exact match? 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that EC is the height. Let me revisit that. 

CE is perpendicular to AB, but AB is a side of the parallelogram. The height of the parallelogram is the distance between AB and CD, which is the length of the projection of AD onto the direction perpendicular to AB. Since AD has length 15, and the angle between AD and AB is the same as the angle between AB and AD, which is the angle of the parallelogram. 

But how is this related to CE? CE is a segment from C, perpendicular to AB. So the length of CE would be the height if E is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. But in this case, the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB would be the projection of C onto AB. 

But in the problem, E is a point such that CE is perpendicular to AB, and triangle BEC is right-angled at E. So E is not necessarily the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. It could be somewhere else along the line perpendicular to AB through C. 

Wait, but if CE is perpendicular to AB, then E lies along the line perpendicular to AB at point C. So the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB is a specific point, but E is somewhere along that line. 

However, in the triangle BEC, which is right-angled at E, so BE is one leg, EC is another leg, and BC is hypotenuse. So from this, we derived EC = sqrt(200). 

But if E is along the perpendicular from C to AB, then the distance from C to AB is the length of CE. Wait, no. If E is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB, then CE is the height. But in this case, the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB would be a point on AB. Let me calculate that. 

Coordinates of C are (p+13, q). The foot of the perpendicular from C to AB (which is the x-axis) is the point (p+13, 0). So the length of CE would be q, the y-coordinate of C. But earlier, we found that EC = sqrt(200), so q = sqrt(200). Hence, the height of the parallelogram is q = sqrt(200), and thus area is 13 * sqrt(200). 

So this confirms that the height is indeed sqrt(200), and area is 13 * sqrt(200) ≈ 183.8. 

But since the answer choices don't include this, perhaps there is a miscalculation. Let me check the initial data again. 

Wait, the problem states that Triangle(B,C,E) is right-angled at E. So in triangle BEC, right-angled at E. So BE and EC are legs, BC is hypotenuse. Given BE=5, BC=15, so EC=sqrt(15² -5²)=sqrt(200). Correct. 

Hence, the height is EC = sqrt(200). So area is 13 * sqrt(200). 

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact value, and the options are rounded? Let me check what 13 * sqrt(200) is exactly. 

sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2), so 13*10*sqrt(2) = 130√2. 

What is 130√2 numerically? As calculated earlier, around 183.8. 

But none of the options match. Wait, looking back at the answer choices:

A. 165

B. 180

C. 195

D. 210

Hmm. Could there be an error in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misunderstood the configuration? 

Wait, another approach: since the area of the parallelogram can also be calculated as twice the area of triangle ABC. 

Area of parallelogram ABCD = 2 * area of triangle ABC. 

But how to find area of triangle ABC? 

But we know AB = 13, BC = 15, and the angle between them. Let me try using the law of cosines. 

But we don't know the angle. However, in the triangle BEC, which is right-angled at E, we can find the angle at B. 

In triangle BEC, tan(angle at B) = EC / BE = sqrt(200)/5 = (10√2)/5 = 2√2. So angle at B is arctan(2√2). 

But how does this relate to the angle of the parallelogram? 

The angle between AB and BC in the parallelogram is the same as the angle at B in triangle ABC. Let me denote this angle as θ. 

In the parallelogram, the area is AB * BC * sinθ = 13 * 15 * sinθ. 

But we can also find sinθ from triangle BEC. 

Since in triangle BEC, angle at B is θ', where tanθ' = EC / BE = 2√2. So θ' = arctan(2√2). 

But how does θ' relate to θ? 

Wait, in the parallelogram, the angle at B is supplementary to the angle between BE and BC. Because BE is part of the triangle BEC, which is inside the parallelogram. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between θ and θ'. 

Alternatively, since CE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is one side, and BC is another side, perhaps the angle between AB and BC is complementary to the angle in triangle BEC. 

But this is getting complicated. Let me try calculating sinθ. 

In triangle BEC, we have BE=5, EC=10√2, BC=15. 

Using the law of sines: sin(angle at E)/BC = sin(angle at B)/EC. But angle at E is 90 degrees. So sin(90°)/15 = sin(angle at B)/(10√2). 

So 1/15 = sin(angle at B)/(10√2) → sin(angle at B) = (10√2)/15 = (2√2)/3 ≈ 0.9428. 

So angle at B is arcsin(2√2/3). 

Then, the area of the parallelogram is 13 * 15 * sinθ, where θ is the angle between AB and BC. But here, θ is the same as the angle at B in the parallelogram. 

Wait, but in the parallelogram, the angle at B is the same as the angle between AB and BC, which is θ. So sinθ = 2√2/3. 

Thus, area = 13 * 15 * (2√2/3) = 13 * 5 * 2√2 = 130√2, same as before. 

So this confirms that the area is 130√2, which is approximately 183.8. 

But the options given don't have this. Perhaps the question expects rounding to the nearest whole number? 183.8 rounds to 184, which still isn't in the options. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the area formula. Let me check once more. 

The area of a parallelogram is base * height. Base is AB = 13, height is the perpendicular distance from AB to CD, which we determined as q = sqrt(200). So 13 * sqrt(200) = 130√2 ≈ 183.8. 

But the answer choices are A. 165, B. 180, C. 195, D. 210. 

Perhaps the intended answer is 195, assuming that the height is 15, and area is 13*15=195? But why would the height be 15? 

Wait, if the height were 15, then area would be 13*15=195, which is option C. But why would the height be 15? Because BC is 15, but that's not the height. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me recheck the given predicates. 

One of the predicates is Perpendicular(Line(C,E), Line(A,B)), which means CE ⊥ AB. Another is RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)), which means angle at E is 90 degrees. So triangle BEC is right-angled at E, with BE=5, BC=15, and EC=sqrt(200). 

But if EC is the height, then area is 13 * sqrt(200). But maybe the question has a typo, and the actual answer expected is 195, assuming that the height is 15. Or perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the height. 

Wait, let's consider that in the parallelogram, the area can also be calculated as base * height, where base is BC=15 and height is the distance from A to BC. To find this height, we can use the area expression. 

If we calculate the area as 130√2, then the height corresponding to base BC would be area / BC = (130√2)/15 = (26√2)/3 ≈ 12.0. But this doesn't align with anything. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem setup. Let me verify all steps again. 

Given that in triangle BEC, BE=5, BC=15, EC=sqrt(200). Hence, area of triangle BEC is (5 * sqrt(200))/2. But how does this relate to the parallelogram? 

Maybe the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle BEC? No, because BEC is not necessarily half of the parallelogram. 

Alternatively, since CE is the height, and AB is the base, the area is 13 * EC = 13 * sqrt(200). 

But if the answer choices are fixed, and the closest is B. 180, which is close to 183.8, perhaps the intended answer is B. 180. 

But why? Maybe there's an error in assuming that EC is the height. Let me reconsider: if CE is not the height, but another segment. 

Wait, in the coordinate system, the height is q, which we found to be sqrt(200). So area is 13 * sqrt(200). 

But sqrt(200) is approximately 14.142. 13 * 14.142 ≈ 183.8. 

If I round this to the nearest tenth, it's 183.8, which is not among the options. But the options are A. 165, B. 180, C. 195, D. 210. 

Wait, maybe the question expects an exact value, and the options are wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, let me calculate 13 * sqrt(200) again. 

sqrt(200) = 10√2. So 13 * 10√2 = 130√2. 

What is 130√2 numerically? 

√2 is approximately 1.41421356. 

130 * 1.41421356 = 

First, 100 * 1.41421356 = 141.421356

30 * 1.41421356 = 42.4264068

Adding together: 141.421356 + 42.4264068 = 183.8477628. 

So approximately 183.85. 

Rounded to the nearest tenth is 183.8. 

Since this is not among the options, but the closest is B. 180, which is 3.8 less. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the other pair of sides and the height? Let me try calculating using BC as base. 

If BC is 15, and the height corresponding to it is the distance from A to BC. How to find this? 

In the coordinate system, point A is (0,0), and line BC goes from B(13,0) to C(p+13, q). The distance from A(0,0) to line BC. 

The formula for the distance from a point (x0,y0) to line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). 

First, find the equation of line BC. Points B(13,0) and C(p+13, q). 

The slope of BC is (q - 0)/(p+13 -13) = q/p. 

So the equation of line BC is y - 0 = (q/p)(x -13). Rearranged: qx - py -13q = 0. 

Distance from A(0,0) to this line is |q*0 - p*0 -13q| / sqrt(q² + p²) = | -13q | / sqrt(q² + p²) = 13q / sqrt(p² + q²). 

But from earlier, p² + q² = 225, so sqrt(p² + q²) = 15. Hence, the distance is 13q / 15. 

So the area of the parallelogram is base BC * height = 15 * (13q/15) = 13q. 

But we previously found q = sqrt(200). So area = 13 * sqrt(200), same as before. 

So regardless of the base chosen, the area is 13 * sqrt(200). 

Thus, the calculation is consistent. 

But since the answer options don't include this value, and the closest is B. 180, I might conclude that the intended answer is B. 180, possibly due to approximation or a mistake in the problem's creation. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem's given data? For example, if EC were 12 instead of sqrt(200), then area would be 13*12=156, not matching. Or if EC were 15, then area would be 195, which is option C. 

Wait, if EC were 12, then area would be 13*12=156. Not matching. If EC were 15, area would be 195, which is option C. 

But according to the given data, EC is sqrt(200), which is approximately 14.14, not 15. So why is option C present? 

Perhaps the problem assumes that EC is 12, leading to area 156, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the given predicates. 

One of the predicates is Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(C,E))), Sub(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(B,E))))) 

Which translates to EC² = BC² - BE² = 15² - 5² = 225 - 25 = 200. So EC = sqrt(200). 

Yes, that's correct. 

So the area is definitely 130√2 ≈ 183.8. 

Given that, and the available choices, the closest is B. 180. However, this is not precise. 

But maybe the problem expects using the exact value of 130√2, and the options are rounded. Let me check what 130√2 is approximately. 

As calculated, it's about 183.8. If the options are rounded to the nearest ten, then 180 is the closest. 

But in the absence of an exact match, and given that 183.8 is closer to 180 than to 195 (difference of 3.8 vs 11.2), the correct choice would be B. 

But I'm unsure why the problem didn't provide this exact value. However, given the options, B is the closest. 

Thus, the Final Answer is B.
