MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, ABC and DEF, which are similar. BG is a median of triangle ABC, and EH is a median of triangle DEF. We need to find the length of EH given that BC is 30 units, BG is 15 units, and EF is 15 units.

First, I remember that in similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. Since ABC ~ DEF, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Also, medians in similar triangles should maintain the same ratio as their corresponding sides.

Let me start by recalling some properties. In a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, BG is a median from B to AC's midpoint G. Similarly, EH is a median from E to DF's midpoint H.

Given that BC = 30 and EF = 15. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of similarity would be BC/EF = 30/15 = 2. That means every side of ABC is twice as long as the corresponding side of DEF.

Now, BG is a median of ABC. Let me think about how medians relate to the sides. There's a formula for the length of a median in terms of the sides of the triangle. But maybe there's a simpler way here since we know the ratio of similarity.

Since the triangles are similar, the medians should also be in the same ratio. So, if BG corresponds to the median in DEF, which is EH, then BG/EH should be equal to the ratio of similarity, which is 2. Wait, but wait—BG is in triangle ABC, and EH is in DEF. So the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF is 2, so each part of ABC is twice the corresponding part in DEF. Therefore, the median BG in ABC would correspond to the median EH in DEF. Hence, BG = 2*EH. But BG is given as 15, so 15 = 2*EH => EH = 15/2 = 7.5. So that would make EH = 7.5, which is option A. 

But wait, let me check again. Because the ratio of similarity is BC/EF = 30/15 = 2. So the ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1. Therefore, all corresponding linear measurements, including medians, should be in the same ratio. So BG (a median in ABC) corresponds to EH (the median in DEF). Thus, BG / EH = 2. So 15 / EH = 2 → EH = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So that's 7.5, which is option A. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should verify if BG is indeed corresponding to EH. Let me think. In triangle ABC, BG is the median from B to AC. In triangle DEF, EH is the median from E to DF. Since the triangles are similar, the order of the vertices matters. ABC ~ DEF implies that AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, and AC to DF. Therefore, the median from B in ABC corresponds to the median from E in DEF. So yes, BG corresponds to EH. Therefore, their lengths are in the ratio of similarity. 

Therefore, the calculation holds. So EH should be half of BG, which is 15/2=7.5. So the answer is A.
