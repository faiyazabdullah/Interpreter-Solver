MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle SQ T, given some information about angles and bisectors. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the problem states that QP and QR are opposite rays. That means they form a straight line, so points P and R are on opposite sides of Q. Therefore, angle SQR would be a straight angle if S were on the line PR, but wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, since QP and QR are opposite rays, then points P and R are in opposite directions from Q. So, the angle at Q between SP and SR? Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this better.

Wait, there are points S, T involved. Also, QT bisects angle SQR. So angle SQR is being bisected by QT. The measures given are m∠SQR = 6x + 8 and m∠TQR = 4x -14. We need to find m∠SQT.

Let me recall that when an angle is bisected, it divides the angle into two equal parts. But here, QT is the bisector of angle SQR. Wait, but angle SQR is split into two angles by QT: ∠SQT and ∠TQR. Wait, but according to the problem statement, ∠TQR is given as 4x -14. Since QT bisects ∠SQR, then those two angles should be equal. Wait, but that might not be the case here because maybe the angle is being split into two parts, one of which is ∠SQT and the other is ∠TQR. Wait, but if QT is the bisector, then ∠SQT should be equal to ∠TQR. However, according to the given equations, ∠SQR equals ∠SQT plus ∠TQR. And also, since QT is the bisector, ∠SQT should equal ∠TQR. Therefore, substituting, we have ∠SQR = 2*(∠TQR). 

But wait, let me check again. Let me make sure. The problem says that QT bisects ∠SQR. So, the entire angle ∠SQR is divided into two equal angles by QT. So, each of those angles (∠SQT and ∠TQR) would be half of ∠SQR. Therefore, ∠SQT = ∠TQR. 

But according to the problem, ∠SQR = 6x + 8, and ∠TQR = 4x -14. So if these two angles are equal, then 6x + 8 = 4x -14. Solving that gives 2x = -22, so x = -11. Wait, but that would lead to negative angle measures, which isn't possible. So something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption is incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the angle being bisected is ∠SQR, and QT splits it into ∠SQT and ∠TQR. Then, since QT is the bisector, ∠SQT = ∠TQR. But according to the given expressions, ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR. Which would mean that ∠SQR = 2*∠SQT. Or equivalently, ∠SQR = 2*∠TQR. 

So, setting up the equation: 6x + 8 = 2*(4x -14). Let's try that. Expanding the right side: 8x -28. Then, bringing terms together: 6x +8 =8x -28 → subtract 6x both sides: 8 = 2x -28 → add 28: 36=2x → x=18. Then, plugging back x=18 into ∠SQR: 6*18+8=108+8=116 degrees. Then ∠TQR=4*18 -14=72-14=58 degrees. Since QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT should be equal to ∠TQR, which would be 58 degrees. Wait, but that would make ∠SQT=58, which is one of the answer choices, D. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says that ∠SQR is being bisected by QT. So ∠SQT and ∠TQR are the two angles formed by the bisector. Thus, ∠SQT = ∠TQR. So if ∠SQR = 6x+8 and ∠TQR = 4x-14, then ∠SQR = 2*∠TQR. Hence, 6x+8=2*(4x-14). Solving this gives 6x+8=8x-28 → 8+28=8x-6x → 36=2x → x=18. Then ∠TQR=4(18)-14=72-14=58. So ∠SQT would be equal to ∠TQR, so 58 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, D is 58. But wait, the options are A.18, B.32, C.36, D.58. So answer D. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that ∠SQT equals ∠TQR. Let me think again. The angle bisector divides the original angle into two equal parts. So if QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR are equal. So ∠SQT = ∠TQR. Therefore, ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR = 2*∠SQT. Alternatively, ∠SQR = 2*∠TQR. Either way. 

So given that ∠SQR = 6x +8 and ∠TQR =4x -14, then 6x +8 = 2*(4x -14). Solving that gives x=18. Then ∠TQR=58, which would be ∠SQT. So answer D. But wait, why does the problem mention another equation: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,R)), Add(MeasureOf(Angle(S,Q,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(T,Q,R)))). Which is essentially stating that ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR. Which is consistent with the angle addition postulate. So that equation is redundant if QT is the bisector, but maybe it's given to confirm that. 

Therefore, solving the equation 6x+8 = 2*(4x-14) leads us to x=18, hence ∠SQT=4x-14=58. Therefore, answer D. But let me check again for errors. 

Another way: suppose that ∠SQT is the angle we need. Since QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT = ∠TQR. But ∠TQR is given as 4x -14. So ∠SQT =4x-14. Also, ∠SQR = ∠SQT + ∠TQR = 2*(4x-14) = 8x -28. But ∠SQR is also given as 6x+8. So set them equal: 6x+8 =8x -28 → same equation as before. Solve: 6x +8 =8x -28 → 8 +28 =8x -6x → 36=2x → x=18. Then ∠SQT=4x-14=4*18-14=72-14=58. So yes, answer D. 

But let me check if there's another interpretation. Suppose that the problem is not saying that QT bisects ∠SQR, but instead that it's bisecting another angle? Wait, the problem says: "Q T bisects ∠S Q R". So the angle being bisected is ∠SQR. Therefore, the previous reasoning holds. 

Thus, the answer is D. 58.
