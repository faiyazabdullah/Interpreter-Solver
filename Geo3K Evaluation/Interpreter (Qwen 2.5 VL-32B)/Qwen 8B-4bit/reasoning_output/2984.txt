MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given here. The problem involves a quadrilateral WXYZ with points W, X, Y, Z connected in order by lines WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. There are also angle measures specified for each vertex: Angle(X) is 'a', Angle(Y) is a - 28, Angle(Z) is a + 2, and Angle(W) is half of a plus 8. Additionally, the sum of all four angles is 360 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle Y, which is one of the options provided.

Alright, so first, I recall that in any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is always 360 degrees. That seems to align with the given SumOf predicate here. So the key here is to set up an equation using the expressions for each angle and solve for 'a', then find the measure of angle Y, which is a - 28.

Let me write down the equations. Let's denote the measure of angle X as a. Then:

Measure of Angle(X) = a  
Measure of Angle(Y) = a - 28  
Measure of Angle(Z) = a + 2  
Measure of Angle(W) = (a)/2 + 8  

Adding all these together equals 360 degrees. So:

a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) + (a/2 + 8) = 360

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let me compute each part:

First, expand all terms:

a + a - 28 + a + 2 + (a/2) + 8

Combine the a terms:

a + a + a + (a/2) = (2a + 2a + a/2). Wait, let me do it step by step.

Wait, original terms:

Term1: a  
Term2: a - 28  
Term3: a + 2  
Term4: a/2 + 8  

So adding them:

Start with Term1 + Term2: a + (a - 28) = 2a - 28  
Then add Term3: 2a - 28 + a + 2 = 3a - 26  
Then add Term4: 3a - 26 + (a/2 + 8) = 3a + a/2 - 26 + 8 = (3a + 0.5a) - 18 = 3.5a - 18

So total sum is 3.5a - 18 = 360.

Wait, but 3.5a is the same as (7a)/2. So:

(7a)/2 - 18 = 360

Now, solve for a:

Add 18 to both sides:

(7a)/2 = 360 + 18 = 378

Multiply both sides by 2:

7a = 756

Divide by 7:

a = 756 / 7 = 108 degrees.

So angle X is 108 degrees. Then angle Y is a - 28, which would be 108 - 28 = 80 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 80. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes mistakes happen in arithmetic.

Wait, let me recheck the combination of terms:

Original equation:

a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) + (a/2 + 8) 

Breaking down term by term:

a + a - 28 + a + 2 + a/2 + 8

Combine the a terms: a + a + a + a/2 = 3a + a/2 = (6a/2 + a/2) = 7a/2. Correct.

Constant terms: -28 + 2 + 8 = (-28 + 10) = -18. Yes, that's correct.

So 7a/2 - 18 = 360 → 7a/2 = 378 → a= 378*2 /7 = 756 /7 = 108. Yes, that's right.

Therefore, angle Y is a -28 = 108 -28 = 80. Which is option A. Hmm. But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option A is 80. However, sometimes there might be a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me confirm if I interpreted the angle measures correctly.

The problem states:

MeasureOf(Angle(X)) is a  
MeasureOf(Angle(Y)) is Sub(a, 28) → which is a -28  
MeasureOf(Angle(Z)) is Add(a, 2) → a +2  
MeasureOf(Angle(W)) is Add(HalfOf(a), 8) → (a/2) +8. Correct.

Yes, that's how I used them. So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, angle Y is 80 degrees, which is option A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about the quadrilateral type? For example, if it's a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180, but the problem doesn't state that. Since the sum of angles is given as 360, which applies to any quadrilateral regardless of being cyclic. So the initial equation should hold.

Another way to check: plug a=108 into all angles:

Angle X: 108  
Angle Y: 108 -28 = 80  
Angle Z: 108 +2 = 110  
Angle W: 108/2 +8 = 54 +8 = 62  

Sum: 108 +80 +110 +62 = 108+80=188; 110+62=172; total 188+172=360. Perfect, that adds up. So yes, a=108, angle Y is 80, so answer A.

But why does option B exist? Maybe I misread something. Let me check again.

No, the problem says the quadrilateral has those angles. All steps seem correct. So answer should be A. But wait, looking at the answer choices again:

A. 80  
B. 108  
C. 110  
D. 114

So 80 is option A. Hence, the correct answer is A. But maybe the problem expects another approach? Or maybe there's a trick?

Wait, could there be a mistake in assuming that the quadrilateral is convex? Well, even if it's concave, the sum of internal angles is still 360. So that shouldn't matter. So the calculation holds. Therefore, the answer is A. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different definitions? Like, maybe the angles are exterior angles? No, the problem mentions "MeasureOf(Angle(X))", which typically refers to interior angles unless stated otherwise. Also, the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is definitely 360. So all checks out.

Thus, the answer must be A. But wait, the answer options have 80 as A. So Final Answer: A.
