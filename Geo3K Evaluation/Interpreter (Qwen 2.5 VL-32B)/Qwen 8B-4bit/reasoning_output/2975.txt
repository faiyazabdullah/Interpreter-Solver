Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

Starting with the points and lines mentioned: there's a circle centered at O, and several points like M, P, R, B, C, A. Lines connecting these points include Line(M,P), Line(M,A), Line(O,P), Line(O,C), Line(O,A), and Line(M,O). Also, there's a tangent line from M to the circle at point P. Additionally, some points lie on the circle, specifically P, C, and A. There's a right angle at Angle(M,P,O), so triangle MPO is a right triangle. 

Given lengths: MO is 20 units, MP is 16 units. Also, there's a relation involving the square of MP being equal to the sum of squares of MO and OP. Wait, that seems like the Pythagorean theorem. Since Angle at P is a right angle, triangle MPO should have legs MO and OP? Wait, but the right angle is at P, so the hypotenuse would be MO? Wait, no. Let me think again. The angle at P is Angle(M,P,O), so vertex at P, with segments PM and PO forming the angle. So if that angle is a right angle, then triangle MPO has a right angle at P. Therefore, by Pythagoras, MO² = MP² + OP². But according to the given predicate, it says Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,P))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,O))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(O,P))))) — wait, that seems conflicting. Because normally, if the right angle is at P, then MO would be the hypotenuse, so MO² = MP² + OP². However, the given predicate states that SquareOf(MP) equals SquareOf(MO) plus SquareOf(OP). That would imply that MP² = MO² + OP², which would mean that the right angle isn't at P. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(M,P,O)). So angle at P between lines PM and PO. Then triangle MPO has right angle at P. Therefore, by Pythagoras, MO² = MP² + OP². But the given equality is SquareOf(MP) = Add(SquareOf(MO), SquareOf(OP)). Which would suggest that MP² = MO² + OP², which contradicts the Pythagorean theorem unless something is wrong. This suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle. Maybe the right angle is not at P but somewhere else? Or maybe the given equality is different. Let me re-examine the predicate.

Looking back: Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,P))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,O))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(O,P))))) — that means MP squared equals MO squared plus OP squared. But if the right angle is at P, then MO should be the hypotenuse, hence MO² = MP² + OP². But the given equation says MP² = MO² + OP², which would make MO² negative, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at O instead? But the predicate says Angle(M,P,O), which is the angle at P. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Perhaps the right angle is actually at O? Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Or perhaps my understanding of the angle is incorrect. Let me double-check. 

The Angle(M,P,O) refers to the angle at point P formed by points M, P, O. So yes, the right angle is at P. Therefore, the sides adjacent to the right angle are PM and PO, making MO the hypotenuse. Hence, MO² = PM² + PO². However, the given predicate says that SquareOf(MP) equals SquareOf(MO) plus SquareOf(OP). That implies MP² = MO² + OP², which would require that MO² is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless... Oh! Wait, perhaps the given equality is written incorrectly? Let me check again. 

The user wrote: Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,P))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,O))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(O,P))))) — which is MP² = MO² + OP². But according to the Pythagorean theorem, since angle at P is right, MO² = MP² + OP². Therefore, the given equality would be MP² = MO² + OP², which is inconsistent. Therefore, either there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the angle isn't at P but at another point? Let me recheck the predicate. The predicate is RightAngle(Angle(M,P,O)), which indeed places the right angle at P. 

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's given data, or maybe I need to reinterpret the diagram. Alternatively, maybe the tangent line is involved here. Since MP is tangent to the circle at P, and O is the center. In such cases, the radius OP is perpendicular to the tangent line MP. Therefore, OP ⊥ MP. So that gives us a right angle at P between OP and MP. So that confirms that triangle MPO is a right triangle with right angle at P, so MO² = MP² + OP². 

But according to the given predicate, SquareOf(MP) = Add(SquareOf(MO), SquareOf(OP)). Which would mean MP² = MO² + OP². But that's not possible unless MO is imaginary. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem's predicates. However, since we're supposed to work with the given predicates, perhaps I need to proceed despite this inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe the given equality is meant to represent the converse? For example, if MP is tangent to the circle, then OP is perpendicular to MP, so triangle MPO is right-angled at P, leading to MO² = MP² + OP². Therefore, the given equality must be correct, implying that MP² = MO² + OP², which would mean that OP² = MP² - MO². Wait, but substituting numbers: Given MO = 20, MP = 16. Then MO² = 400, MP² = 256. According to the given equality, MP² = MO² + OP² → 256 = 400 + OP² → OP² = -144, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem setup, but since we have to proceed, perhaps I need to consider that the given equality is actually MO² = MP² + OP², which would align with the Pythagorean theorem. Maybe the user made a mistake in writing the predicate. Assuming that the correct relationship is MO² = MP² + OP², then we can proceed. Let me try that. 

So, assuming MO² = MP² + OP². Given MO = 20, MP = 16. Then OP² = MO² - MP² = 400 - 256 = 144 → OP = 12. So OP = 12. 

Now, looking at other predicates. It also says Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,P)), LengthOf(Line(O,C))) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,P)), LengthOf(Line(O,A))). Therefore, OC = OA = OP = 12. Since O is the center of the circle, points C and A lie on the circle, so their distances from O are radii. Thus, OC and OA are radii of the circle. Therefore, OP is also a radius, so OP = 12. 

Then, there's another equality: Equals(Mul(LengthOf(Line(M,C)), LengthOf(Line(M,A))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,P)))). So, MC × MA = MP². Since MP = 16, MP² = 256. Therefore, MC × MA = 256. 

Additionally, there's Equals(Add(LengthOf(Line(M,C)), LengthOf(Line(C,A))), LengthOf(Line(M,A))). So, MC + CA = MA. 

Let me denote variables. Let’s call MC = x, MA = y. Then from the above, x × y = 256. And also, x + CA = y. But CA is the distance between points C and A. Since both C and A are on the circle centered at O, and OA and OC are radii (each 12 units). So, OA = OC = 12. Therefore, triangle OAC is an equilateral triangle? Not necessarily, unless angle AOC is 60 degrees. But without knowing the angle, we can’t assume that. 

However, points A and C are both on the circle with center O. So OA = OC = 12. The segment AC is a chord of the circle. To find its length, we might need more information about the angle subtended by AC at the center. However, perhaps there's another way. 

Alternatively, considering points M, C, A. We know that MA = y, MC = x, and CA = y - x. Also, since points C and A are on the circle, perhaps triangle MAC relates to other elements. 

But maybe we can use power of a point. Since M lies outside the circle, and MP is tangent to the circle at P. The power of point M with respect to the circle is equal to MP² = MC × MA. Which is exactly the given predicate: Mul(MC, MA) = MP². So that checks out. 

Therefore, using power of a point, we have MC × MA = MP² = 256. Also, from the other equality, MA = MC + CA. 

But how do we find CA? Well, since A and C are points on the circle, OA = OC = 12. So triangle OAC has OA = OC = 12. The length AC depends on the angle ∠AOC. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle MAC can be connected with other triangles. Let me think. 

We know MO = 20, and earlier deduced that OP = 12. Also, since OP is a radius, and O is the center. Now, point C is on the circle, so OC = 12. What about point A? Similarly, OA = 12. So both A and C are points on the circle. 

Perhaps triangle OMA? Let's see. OM = 20, OA = 12. But where is point A located? It's on the circle, so OA is a radius. If we can find MA, which is one of the variables. 

But we have two equations: 
1. x * y = 256
2. x + CA = y

But we need another relation to connect these variables. 

Since points A and C are on the circle, and O is the center, OA = OC = 12. Let's consider triangle OAC. The length AC can be found if we know the angle ∠AOC. But how?

Alternatively, since points A and C are both on the circle, and line MC intersects the circle at C and A, then by power of a point, we have MC × MA = MP². Which we already used. 

But perhaps we can find coordinates for points to model this scenario. Let me attempt coordinate geometry. 

Let’s place point O at the origin (0,0). Since OP is a radius and is perpendicular to MP (because MP is tangent at P), we can set up coordinates accordingly. Let me assume that point P is at (a, b), but since OP is perpendicular to MP, and O is at (0,0), then vector OP is perpendicular to vector MP. 

Alternatively, since angle at P is right, and OP is perpendicular to MP. Let me choose coordinates where O is at (0,0), and since OP is a radius, let's take P at (12, 0), because OP = 12. Then, since MP is tangent at P, and OP is perpendicular to MP, then line MP is vertical if OP is horizontal. Wait, if OP is along the x-axis from O(0,0) to P(12,0), then the tangent line at P is perpendicular to OP, so it's vertical. Therefore, line MP is vertical, passing through P(12,0). Therefore, point M lies somewhere along the vertical line through P. But MO is given as 20. Let me compute coordinates of M. 

Since line MP is vertical through P(12,0), so M is somewhere along x=12. Let’s say M is at (12, k). Then distance MO is the distance from (12,k) to (0,0): sqrt((12)^2 + k^2) = 20. Therefore:

sqrt(144 + k²) = 20 → 144 + k² = 400 → k² = 256 → k = ±16. 

Thus, point M is at (12, 16) or (12, -16). Let's take M as (12, 16) for simplicity. 

Now, points A and C are on the circle centered at O with radius 12. So their coordinates satisfy x² + y² = 144. 

Also, line MA connects M(12,16) to A(x,y) on the circle. Similarly, line MC connects M(12,16) to C(x',y') on the circle. 

From the power of a point, MC × MA = 256. Also, from the given, MA = MC + CA. 

But how to find CA? Since A and C are points on the circle, and line MA passes through them. So points A and C lie on the line MA. 

Alternatively, since line MA passes through points M(12,16), A, and C. So parametrize line MA. 

Parametric equations: Starting at M(12,16), direction vector towards A and C. Let me parameterize line MA. 

Let’s suppose that points A and C are two intersection points of line MA with the circle. Then, by power of a point, MC × MA = MP² = 256. 

Let me recall that the power of point M with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from M to the points of intersection with the circle. So, if line MA intersects the circle at A and C, then MC × MA = 256. 

But in our case, since line MA starts at M, goes through C, then A? Or vice versa? Depending on the position. 

Assuming that C is closer to M than A, then MC would be the distance from M to C, and CA would be from C to A, so MA = MC + CA. Hence, MA = MC + CA. 

But how do we find the coordinates of A and C? 

Alternatively, since we know that OA = 12, and O is at (0,0), we can write equations for points A and C lying on the circle and on line MA. 

First, find the equation of line MA. Since M is (12,16), and let’s assume that line MA has some slope. Let me compute the slope. 

But without knowing where A is, it's hard. However, we can use parametric forms. Let me define parametric equations for line MA. 

Let’s let t be a parameter. Points on line MA can be expressed as (12 + t*(dx), 16 + t*(dy)), where dx and dy are direction ratios. However, since we don't know the direction, maybe better to express in terms of a variable. 

Alternatively, since points A and C lie on the circle x² + y² = 144 and on line MA. Let me find the equation of line MA. Suppose line MA has a certain slope, but since we don't know it, perhaps we can use the fact that points A and C are intersections of line MA with the circle. 

But since we don't know the equation of MA, maybe we can use the power of a point formula directly. 

Power of point M with respect to the circle is |MO|² - r², where r is the radius. Wait, yes! The power of point M is MO² - r². Since MO = 20, r = 12, so power = 20² - 12² = 400 - 144 = 256. Which equals MP², as given. And this power is also equal to MC × MA. So that matches. 

But how does this help us find MC or MA? Well, we need more info. 

Wait, the problem asks to find the length of MC, given that MO = 20. From the previous calculation, we found that OP = 12, and points A and C are on the circle. 

But perhaps there's another relation. Looking back at the given predicates, there's Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,P)), LengthOf(Line(O,C))) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,P)), LengthOf(Line(O,A))). So OP = OC = OA = 12. 

Moreover, there's a line from O to A, and from O to C. Also, line MA connects M to A, and line MC connects M to C. 

Is there a possibility that points A and C are symmetric with respect to some axis? For instance, since line MP is vertical (as per our coordinate system), maybe points A and C are placed symmetrically around the x-axis or something. 

Alternatively, since line MA intersects the circle at A and C, and we know that power of point M is 256, which is MC × MA = 256. Also, we have MA = MC + CA. 

But without knowing CA, it's challenging. However, since points A and C are on the circle, and O is the center, maybe triangle OAC has some properties. 

Wait, OA and OC are both radii, so OA = OC = 12. The distance between A and C is AC. Using the law of cosines in triangle OAC: AC² = OA² + OC² - 2*OA*OC*cosθ, where θ is the angle between OA and OC. But without knowing θ, we can't compute AC directly. 

Alternatively, since points A and C are on the circle and line MA passes through them, perhaps there's another relation. 

But maybe there's another way. Let's go back to the power of a point. We have MC × MA = 256. Also, MA = MC + CA. So, if we could find CA, we could solve for MC. 

But how to find CA? Let me think. If points A and C are on the circle, then AC is a chord of the circle. The maximum possible length of AC is the diameter, which is 24. But without more info, it's unclear. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relation involving triangle MAC. For instance, using Stewart's theorem or something. 

Alternatively, since we've placed coordinates for O and M, maybe we can find coordinates for points A and C. 

Earlier, we had M at (12,16), O at (0,0), and P at (12,0). Line MA passes through M(12,16) and intersects the circle at A and C. Let me find the equation of line MA. But we need more information to determine its slope. However, we know that line MA passes through M(12,16) and intersects the circle at A and C. 

Let me denote the line MA parametrically. Let’s suppose the line MA has a direction vector. Let’s say parametric equations are x = 12 + t*dx, y = 16 + t*dy. 

But since points A and C are on the circle x² + y² = 144, substitute into the circle equation:

(12 + t*dx)^2 + (16 + t*dy)^2 = 144.

Expanding this:

(144 + 24t*dx + t² dx²) + (256 + 32t*dy + t² dy²) = 144.

Combine terms:

144 + 256 + 24t*dx + 32t*dy + t²(dx² + dy²) = 144.

Simplify:

400 + t*(24dx + 32dy) + t²(dx² + dy²) = 144.

Which becomes:

t²(dx² + dy²) + t*(24dx + 32dy) + (400 - 144) = 0 → t²(...) + t(...) + 256 = 0.

But this seems too abstract without knowing dx and dy. However, note that the product of the roots of this quadratic equation corresponds to the product of the parameters t1 and t2 for points A and C. 

In general, for a line intersecting a circle, the product of the parameters t1*t2 equals c/a, where the quadratic is at² + bt + c = 0. Here, the quadratic is t²(dx² + dy²) + t*(24dx + 32dy) + 256 = 0. So product of roots t1*t2 = 256 / (dx² + dy²).

But the product of the roots t1*t2 corresponds to the product of the signed distances from M to points A and C. However, since the power of point M is MC × MA = 256, and depending on the direction, the signs may vary. 

Assuming that t represents the parameter such that t=0 corresponds to M, and positive t moves in one direction, negative in the other. Then, if points A and C are on opposite sides of M, the product t1*t2 would be negative. But since the power is positive, it's likely that MC × MA = 256 regardless of direction. 

But this seems too vague. Let me think differently. Since line MA intersects the circle at A and C, and M is outside the circle, the power of M is MC × MA = 256. If we denote MA as the entire length from M to A, and MC as the length from M to C, then depending on the order of the points. 

Assume that C is between M and A. Then, MC is part of MA, so MA = MC + CA. Hence, MA = MC + CA. Also, power of point gives MC × MA = 256. 

So we have two equations:

1. MC × MA = 256
2. MA = MC + CA

But we still need a third equation to relate these variables. However, CA is the distance between A and C on the circle. How can we relate CA to other quantities? 

Since A and C are points on the circle, and O is the center, OA = OC = 12. Triangle OAC has sides OA = OC = 12, and AC. The Law of Cosines gives AC² = OA² + OC² - 2*OA*OC*cosθ, where θ is the angle ∠AOC. But without knowing θ, we can't find AC. 

But perhaps there's a relationship between θ and other parts of the diagram. For example, since line MA passes through A and C, and we know coordinates of M, maybe we can find θ in terms of coordinates. 

Alternatively, since points A and C lie on line MA, and O is at (0,0), perhaps there's a relation involving vectors. 

Let me return to the coordinate system. We have O(0,0), M(12,16), and P(12,0). Line MP is vertical. The circle has equation x² + y² = 144. Line MA passes through M(12,16) and intersects the circle at A and C. 

Let me find the equation of line MA. But we need more information. However, since we know that line MA intersects the circle at A and C, and we can use the power of a point. 

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of M, we can write the equation of line MA in terms of a parameter. Let me assume that line MA has a slope m. Then its equation is y - 16 = m(x - 12). 

To find intersections with the circle x² + y² = 144, substitute y = m(x - 12) + 16 into the circle equation:

x² + [m(x - 12) + 16]^2 = 144.

Expand this:

x² + m²(x - 12)^2 + 32m(x - 12) + 256 = 144.

Simplify:

x² + m²(x² - 24x + 144) + 32m(x - 12) + 256 - 144 = 0.

Which simplifies to:

x² + m²x² - 24m²x + 144m² + 32mx - 384m + 112 = 0.

Combine like terms:

(1 + m²)x² + (-24m² + 32m)x + (144m² - 384m + 112) = 0.

This quadratic in x has solutions corresponding to points A and C. The product of the roots x1*x2 is given by the constant term divided by the coefficient of x². 

But this seems complicated. However, we know that the product of the roots (for x-coordinates) multiplied by the corresponding y-coordinates might give us relations. However, this approach might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, since we know the power of point M is 256, which equals MC × MA. If we can express MC and MA in terms of the coordinates. 

Let me recall that in power of a point, if a line through M intersects the circle at X and Y, then MX × MY = power of M. In this case, points X and Y are A and C. So, if we denote the distances from M to A and M to C as MA and MC, then MA × MC = 256. 

But we also have MA = MC + CA. So combining these, we can write MA = MC + CA, and MA × MC = 256. 

Let me denote MC = x, MA = y. So:

y = x + CA  
and  
x * y = 256  

But we still need to relate CA to other known quantities. 

CA is the distance between points A and C on the circle. As before, OA = OC = 12, so triangle OAC has OA = OC = 12, and AC is the base. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle OAC: AC² = 12² + 12² - 2*12*12*cosθ, where θ is ∠AOC. 

But how to find θ? 

Perhaps using coordinates. Let me think. Points A and C are on the line MA, which has equation y - 16 = m(x - 12). Let me find the angle between vectors OA and OC. 

Alternatively, since points A and C are on the line MA, and O is at (0,0), the vectors OA and OC are from O to A and C. The angle between them would depend on the positions of A and C on line MA. 

Alternatively, consider that the line MA passes through M(12,16) and intersects the circle at A and C. The points A and C are symmetrical in some way? 

Wait, since line MP is tangent at P(12,0), and line MA intersects the circle at A and C, perhaps there's a relation between A and C with respect to P? 

Alternatively, since we have multiple points on the circle, perhaps there are other tangents or secants. 

But this seems getting too abstract. Let me try plugging in the values we have. 

We know that MO = 20, and OP = 12. Also, from earlier, we have MA × MC = 256. If we can find another equation relating MA and MC, we can solve for them. 

But how? 

Wait, let's consider triangle MAC. We know MA and MC, and we want to find CA. But without knowing the angle between MA and MC, we can't directly apply the Law of Cosines. 

But perhaps there's another relationship. For example, since points A and C are on the circle, and O is the center, maybe triangle OAM and OCM have some properties. 

For example, in triangle OAM, OA = 12, OM = 20, and AM is a side. Similarly for OCM. 

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle OAM:

OM² = OA² + AM² - 2*OA*AM*cos(angle OAM)

But angle OAM is not known. 

Alternatively, applying the Law of Cosines in triangle OAM:

OM² = OA² + AM² - 2*OA*AM*cos(angle OAM)

But this introduces another unknown angle. 

Alternatively, using coordinates again. Assume that point A is (x, y) on the circle, so x² + y² = 144. Also, since A lies on line MA, which passes through M(12,16). Let me find the coordinates of A. 

The line MA passes through M(12,16) and A(x,y). The slope of MA is (y - 16)/(x - 12). 

But since A is on the circle, x² + y² = 144. 

But without knowing the slope, this is still underdetermined. 

Wait, but we can use the power of a point. For line MA, the product MC × MA = 256. Let me assume that the length from M to C is x, and from M to A is y. So x*y = 256. Also, since points C and A are on the line MA, and assuming C is between M and A, then MA = MC + CA => y = x + CA. 

But CA is the distance between C and A on the line. If I can express CA in terms of x and y, but how? 

Alternatively, since CA = y - x, and we need to find x. But without knowing y, it's tricky. 

Wait, but if I assume that CA is the chord length between A and C, and since both are on the circle, maybe there's a relation involving the distance between A and C. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me think about possible values. 

Given the answer choices are A. 5, B. sqrt(80), C. 12, D. 16. 

We know that MO = 20, and OP = 12. Also, MP = 16. 

From the power of point, MC × MA = 256. 

If we assume that MC is one of the options, let's test them. 

Option C is 12. Let's assume MC = 12. Then MA = 256 / 12 ≈ 21.33. Then CA = MA - MC ≈ 9.33. Is there a way to verify this? 

Alternatively, if MC = 12, then MA = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33. 

But how does this relate to other parts of the diagram? 

Alternatively, let's think about the coordinates. Earlier, we had M at (12,16), O at (0,0), and P at (12,0). Let me try finding points A and C on the circle that lie on line MA. 

Suppose line MA has some slope, and intersects the circle at A and C. Let me pick a specific case. 

Let me assume that line MA is horizontal, but that would mean it's parallel to the x-axis. But M is at (12,16), so a horizontal line would be y = 16. Intersecting with the circle x² + y² = 144 gives x² + 256 = 144 → x² = -112, which is impossible. So no intersection. Hence, line MA cannot be horizontal. 

What if line MA is vertical? Then x = 12. Substituting into the circle equation: 12² + y² = 144 → y² = 0 → y=0. So the line x=12 intersects the circle at (12,0), which is point P. So in this case, line MA would be the same as line MP, which is tangent at P. But in this case, the line MA would only intersect the circle at P, making it a tangent. But the problem states that line MA intersects the circle at A and C, implying two distinct points. Hence, line MA cannot be vertical. 

Therefore, line MA has some non-vertical slope. Let me try to find its equation. 

Let me consider that line MA passes through M(12,16) and intersects the circle at A and C. Let me use the condition that the product of distances MC × MA = 256. 

But how to find this without knowing the slope? 

Wait, perhaps using the concept of inversion or other methods. Alternatively, since we know MO = 20 and the radius is 12, and the power is 256, which equals MC × MA. 

But if I assume that MA is the entire length from M to the farthest point on the circle, and MC is the shorter segment. 

Alternatively, think of MA as the length from M to A, and MC as from M to C. If I can find MA, then MC = 256 / MA. 

But how to find MA? 

Maybe using the distance from M to A. Since A is on the circle, OA = 12, and OM = 20. So in triangle OAM, we have sides OM = 20, OA = 12, and AM. By the Law of Cosines:

OM² = OA² + AM² - 2*OA*AM*cos(angle OAM)

But angle OAM is not known. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle OAM:

AM² = OM² + OA² - 2*OM*OA*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OM and OA. 

But again, theta is unknown. 

However, if we consider that points A and C are on the circle, and line MA passes through them, perhaps there's a way to relate this. 

Alternatively, since we have two points A and C on the circle, and line MA, maybe we can use the fact that the midpoint of AC is the foot of the perpendicular from O to line MA? No, that's not necessarily true. 

Alternatively, since we know the power of M is 256, and the radius is 12, perhaps there's a relation between the distance from M to the center and the length of the chord AC. 

The length of the chord AC can be calculated using the formula: length = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the line. 

Here, line MA is at distance d from O. The length AC is 2√(12² - d²). 

But how to find d? 

The distance from O to line MA can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line. 

Let me find the equation of line MA. Since it passes through M(12,16) and has some slope m. Let's denote it as y - 16 = m(x - 12). 

The distance from O(0,0) to this line is |0 - m*0 + (-12m + 16)| / sqrt(m² + 1) = |-12m + 16| / sqrt(m² + 1). 

Let me denote this distance as d = |16 - 12m| / sqrt(m² + 1). 

Then, the length of chord AC is 2√(12² - d²) = 2√(144 - d²). 

But also, from power of a point, we have MC × MA = 256. Also, the length of AC is related to MC and MA. 

But I'm not sure how to connect this. 

However, let me recall that in this scenario, the length AC is also equal to MA - MC (assuming C is between M and A). So AC = MA - MC. 

Let me denote MA = y, MC = x, so AC = y - x. 

And we have x * y = 256. 

Also, AC = 2√(144 - d²) = y - x. 

But I need to relate d to x and y. 

Alternatively, since line MA passes through M(12,16) and has distance d from O, and the length of AC is 2√(144 - d²) = y - x. 

But how to find d? 

Alternatively, using the relation between d and the power of point M. The power of M is equal to the square of the tangent from M to the circle, which is MP² = 256. Also, the power can be expressed as MO² - r² = 20² - 12² = 256, which matches. 

But also, the power of M is equal to the square of the distance from M to the line AC, multiplied by something? No, that's not standard. 

Wait, the power of M is equal to the square of the tangent, which is 256, and it's also equal to MC × MA. 

But I'm going in circles here. Let me think of another approach. 

Since we have MA × MC = 256, and we need to find MC. Let's assume that MA = 16, then MC = 256 / 16 = 16. But that would mean MA = MC = 16, so CA = 0, which is impossible. 

If MA = 256 / x, and CA = MA - x, then AC = 256/x - x. 

But AC is also equal to 2√(144 - d²). 

But without knowing d, this is still unresolved. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to find d using the coordinates of M. 

The distance from O to line MA is d = |16 - 12m| / sqrt(m² + 1). 

But also, the line MA passes through M(12,16), so the equation is y = m(x - 12) + 16. 

The power of point M is 256, which is also equal to the square of the tangent from M to the circle, which is MP² = 16² = 256. This matches. 

But how does this help us? 

Wait, the length of the tangent from M to the circle is MP = 16, which is fixed. 

But I'm not seeing the connection to AC. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look back at the answer choices. The options are 5, sqrt(80), 12, 16. 

Given that OP = 12, and MA × MC = 256, if MC = 12, then MA = 256 / 12 ≈ 21.33, which is plausible. 

If MC = 12, then MA = 256 / 12 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33. 

But how to confirm this? 

Alternatively, let's consider that in the Power of a Point theorem, if MC × MA = 256, and if we assume that CA = 16, then MA = MC + 16. Let's say MC = x, so x(x + 16) = 256 → x² + 16x - 256 = 0. Solving this: x = [-16 ± sqrt(256 + 1024)] / 2 = [-16 ± sqrt(1280)] / 2 = [-16 ± 16√5]/2 = -8 ± 8√5. Taking positive root: 8(-1 + √5) ≈ 8(1.236) ≈ 9.89, which isn't among the options. 

Alternatively, if CA = 12, then MA = x + 12, so x(x + 12) = 256 → x² + 12x - 256 = 0 → x = [-12 ± sqrt(144 + 1024)] / 2 = [-12 ± sqrt(1168)] / 2 = [-12 ± 4√73] / 2 = -6 ± 2√73. Positive solution is approximately 16.1, not matching options. 

If CA = 8, then x(x + 8) = 256 → x² + 8x - 256 = 0 → x = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 1024)] / 2 = [-8 ± sqrt(1088)] / 2 = [-8 ± 8√17]/2 = -4 ± 4√17. Positive solution ≈ 14.6, not matching. 

Hmm. None of these seem to match the options. Let me think of another approach. 

Wait, earlier we found that OP = 12, and since OC = 12, and O is the center. If we consider triangle OMC, where O is (0,0), M is (12,16), and C is a point on the circle. 

Using the coordinates, let's calculate OM = 20, OC = 12, and MC is what we need to find. 

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle OMC: 

MC² = OM² + OC² - 2*OM*OC*cos(angle MOMC). 

But angle at O between OM and OC is unknown. 

But if we can find this angle, we can compute MC. 

But how? 

Alternatively, since point C is on the circle, OC = 12. Vector OC is from O to C, which is (cx, cy), with cx² + cy² = 144. 

Vector OM is from O to M, which is (12,16). 

The dot product between OM and OC is 12*cx + 16*cy. 

But without knowing cx and cy, it's difficult. 

However, since point C lies on line MA, which passes through M(12,16) and C. 

Let me parameterize line MC. Let's say point C is on line MA, so it can be represented as M + t*(direction vector). 

Let me assume that vector from M to C is t times some direction. 

But this is too vague. 

Let me try to use the earlier assumption that MC × MA = 256 and MA = MC + CA. Let me assume that CA is the length of the chord AC, which is 24 (the diameter). Then, MA = MC + 24. So MC*(MC + 24) = 256 → MC² + 24MC - 256 = 0. Solving: MC = [-24 ± sqrt(576 + 1024)] / 2 = [-24 ± sqrt(1600)] / 2 = [-24 ± 40]/2. Positive solution: (16)/2 = 8. So MC = 8. But 8 is not an option. 

Alternatively, if CA is the length of the radius, 12. Then MA = MC + 12. So MC*(MC + 12) = 256 → MC² + 12MC - 256 = 0 → MC = [-12 ± sqrt(144 + 1024)] / 2 = [-12 ± sqrt(1168)] / 2 ≈ [-12 + 34.17]/2 ≈ 11.08, not matching. 

Wait, none of these are working. Maybe there's an error in my assumptions. Let me revisit the initial step where I assumed MO² = MP² + OP². 

Originally, the given predicate said Equals(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,P))), Add(SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(M,O))), SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(O,P))))) → MP² = MO² + OP². But this leads to a contradiction. However, if we assume that it's a typo and the correct relation is MO² = MP² + OP², then OP² = MO² - MP² = 400 - 256 = 144 → OP = 12. 

With this, OP = 12, and since OP is a radius, the circle has radius 12. 

Now, using the power of point M, MC × MA = MP² = 256. 

Now, if I consider that points
