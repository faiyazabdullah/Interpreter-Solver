Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several points: W, X, Y, Z, C, G, H, I, J, L. There are lines connecting them: Line(W,X), Line(X,Y), Line(Y,Z), Line(Z,C), Line(I,J), Line(H,J), Line(X,J), Line(Y,J). Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(J,I,H) and Triangle(J,X,Y). Angles given are Angle(W,X,J)=130° and Angle(W,Z,G)=20°. Additionally, there's a ratio equality: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. And some collinearity conditions: Points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, and points X and Y lie on line WC.

So the main goal is to find the measure of angle J, which I assume refers to angle at point J, maybe angle IJH or something similar? Wait, the question says "find m∠J", so probably referring to angle at point J formed by certain lines. But need to clarify which angle exactly. However, since there are multiple angles involving J, like Angle(I,J,H) and Angle(X,J,Y), but also other possibilities.

First, let me visualize the diagram based on the given lines and collinear points. Since W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, that means they lie on a straight line. So line WC passes through these points in order W-X-Y-Z-C. Also, points X and Y are on line WC. Then, there are lines from X to J, Y to J, I to J, H to J. Also, Triangle(J,I,H) implies that points I, J, H form a triangle. Similarly, Triangle(J,X,Y) would imply that points J, X, Y form a triangle. Wait, but if X and Y are on line WC, and J is connected to X and Y, forming triangle JXY. Also, I and H are connected to J, forming triangle JIH.

Additionally, there's a line from W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to C. So the entire line WC has segments WX, XY, YZ, ZC. Now, the angles given are ∠WXJ=130°, which is the angle at X between W and J. Another angle is ∠WZG=20°, which involves point G. Not sure where G is located yet. Also, there's a ratio of lengths: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This suggests that triangles JIH and JXY might be similar? Because if two sides are proportional and included angles are equal, then similarity could be inferred. But need to check.

Let me note down the given ratios: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. So if we consider triangles JIH and JXY, perhaps they are similar? For similarity, we need corresponding angles equal. Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar via SAS similarity if the included angles are equal. But first, need to find those angles.

Also, the angle at X, ∠WXJ=130°, which is part of triangle JXW. Maybe considering triangle JXW, where we know one angle. Also, there's another angle ∠WZG=20°, which may relate to other parts of the diagram.

Since points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, line WC is straight. So angle ∠WXJ is formed at point X between points W, X, J. So line XJ forms some angle with line WC. Similarly, line ZJ would form another angle?

Wait, but point Z is on line WC, so line ZC is part of the same line. Also, point G is mentioned in angle ∠WZG=20°, so G is another point somewhere. Not sure about its position yet. Maybe it's connected to other lines?

But focusing back on the main problem: finding m∠J. Assuming ∠J refers to angle at point J. Which angle? Possibly ∠IJK or something else? Wait, looking at the triangles given: Triangle(J,I,H) and Triangle(J,X,Y). In Triangle(J,X,Y), the angles would be at points X, J, Y. So ∠XJY is part of that triangle. Similarly, in Triangle(J,I,H), ∠IJH is part of that triangle. But how does that relate to the overall diagram?

Alternatively, maybe ∠J refers to the sum of angles around point J? Or maybe the angle between lines HI and HJ or something else. Wait, the problem states "find m∠J"—usually, unless specified otherwise, ∠J would refer to the angle at point J formed by two adjacent points. Given that there are lines from J to I, H, X, Y, maybe ∠IJH or ∠XJY? Or perhaps the total angle around point J?

Wait, but in the given angles, there's ∠WXJ=130°, which is at X, not J. So maybe ∠J here refers to the angle at J between lines connected to other points. For example, if there are two lines meeting at J, forming an angle. Let's think about the lines connected to J: Line(I,J), Line(H,J), Line(X,J), Line(Y,J). So J is connected to I, H, X, Y. Therefore, depending on which two lines form the angle, different angles are possible. 

For instance, if we consider the angle between lines IJ and HJ, that would be ∠IJH. Or between lines XJ and YJ, which would be ∠XJY. But given that there's a ratio of IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, this suggests that triangles JIH and JXY might be similar. If that's the case, then their corresponding angles would be equal. For example, if ∠IJH corresponds to ∠XJY, then those angles would be equal. 

But first, let me confirm the similarity. If IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if the included angles between those sides are equal, then triangles JIH and JXY would be similar by SAS similarity. What's the included angle for each triangle?

In triangle JIH, the sides around angle at J would be JI and JH. In triangle JXY, the sides around angle at J would be JX and JY. So if the angle between JI and JH equals the angle between JX and JY, then the triangles would be similar. But do we know anything about those angles?

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar because of the given ratio and some angle relations. But without knowing the angles, it's hard to say. However, there's another piece of information: the angles at W. 

Given that ∠WXJ=130°, which is at point X between W and J. Since points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, line WX is part of line WC. So, at point X, there's a line going to J, making an angle of 130 degrees with line WC. That suggests that line XJ is forming a 130-degree angle with line WC. 

Similarly, there's another angle ∠WZG=20°, which is at point Z between W and G. Not sure where G is, but perhaps it relates to other parts of the diagram. However, since G is a point, and there's a line from Z to G, but not sure about its relation yet.

Now, considering the line WC passing through X, Y, Z, etc., and the lines from X and Y to J. Let me try to imagine triangle JXY. At point X, angle between line WX (which is along WC) and line XJ is 130 degrees. So in triangle JXY, angle at X is 130 degrees. Wait, but triangle JXY would have vertices at J, X, Y. So the angles at X, Y, and J. 

But if line XY is part of line WC, then angle at X in triangle JXY is between lines XJ and XY (which is along WC). So that angle is 130 degrees. Therefore, in triangle JXY, angle at X is 130°. 

Then, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angles at Y and J would add up to 50°. But without more info, can't determine individual angles yet. However, there's a ratio given: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. If we can find some relationship between triangles JIH and JXY, perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Assuming that triangles JIH and JXY are similar, then their angles would correspond. Suppose that ∠IJH corresponds to ∠XJY. If that's the case, then ∠IJH = ∠XJY. But ∠XJY is part of triangle JXY, which we've determined has angles adding to 180°, with one angle being 130°, so the other two angles sum to 50°. 

But how does that relate to the other triangle JIH? Well, if triangles are similar, then their corresponding angles are equal. So ∠IJH would equal ∠XJY. But what is ∠XJY? It's the angle at Y in triangle JXY. Wait, but earlier I thought angle at X was 130°, so angles at Y and J in triangle JXY would be... Hmm, maybe I should compute those angles.

In triangle JXY, angle at X is 130°, so angles at Y and J sum to 50°. Let's denote angle at Y as α and angle at J as β. So α + β = 50°. Now, if triangles JIH and JXY are similar, then ∠IJH (which is angle at J in triangle JIH) would correspond to angle at Y in triangle JXY (α), assuming similarity. Wait, but I'm not sure about the correspondence. 

Alternatively, since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if angle between IJ and HJ equals angle between XJ and YJ, then triangles JIH and JXY are similar by SAS. Let me suppose that angle at J in triangle JIH is equal to angle at X in triangle JXY. Wait, angle at X in triangle JXY is 130°, so that would make angle at J in triangle JIH equal to 130°, but that seems conflicting with other information. 

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the correspondence. If IJ corresponds to XJ, and HJ corresponds to YJ, then the included angles would be ∠IJH and ∠XJY. So if those angles are equal, then the triangles are similar. So ∠IJH = ∠XJY. 

But in triangle JXY, angle at Y is ∠XJY, which we called α. Earlier, we had α + β = 50°, where β is angle at J in triangle JXY. But angle at J in triangle JXY is β, which would correspond to angle ∠XJY? No, wait: in triangle JXY, the angles are at J, X, Y. So angle at J is between XJ and YJ, which is ∠XJY? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle JXY, the vertices are J, X, Y. So the angle at J is between XJ and YJ. The angle at X is between JX and XY. The angle at Y is between JY and YX. 

Therefore, angle at J in triangle JXY is ∠XJY. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify: in triangle JXY, the three angles are:

- At vertex X: between JX and XY → which is given as 130°.

- At vertex Y: between JY and YX → which would be angle ∠JYX.

- At vertex J: between XJ and YJ → which is angle ∠XJY.

So, in triangle JXY, angles are 130° (at X), ∠JYX (at Y), and ∠XJY (at J). Summing to 180°, so ∠JYX + ∠XJY = 50°.

If triangles JIH and JXY are similar, then their corresponding angles would be equal. Let's assume that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ implies that the triangles are similar by SAS, requiring that the included angles are equal. The included angle for triangle JIH would be ∠IJH (between IJ and HJ), and the included angle for triangle JXY would be ∠XJY (between XJ and YJ). Therefore, if ∠IJH = ∠XJY, then triangles JIH ~ JXY by SAS similarity.

Assuming this similarity, then ∠IJH = ∠XJY. From above, ∠XJY (in triangle JXY) is part of the angles summing to 50°. But without more info, we can't directly get its measure. However, there's another angle given: ∠WZG=20°, which might relate to other parts of the diagram.

Looking at point Z: since Z lies on line WC, and there's a line from Z to G, forming angle ∠WZG=20°. So at point Z, between W and G. Maybe line ZG creates some triangle or relates to other elements. Perhaps triangle WGZ? But without more info on where G is, it's tricky. However, since the ratio of IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ is given, and we're trying to connect angles, maybe there's a way to use that ratio with other angles.

Alternatively, let's consider the lines from J. We have lines to I, H, X, Y. The given ratio suggests that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. So if we take the ratio of the lengths of IJ to XJ equals the ratio of HJ to YJ. This could imply that triangles JIH and JXY are similar, as previously thought. If that's true, then their corresponding angles are equal. So ∠IJH = ∠XJY. 

From triangle JXY, we know that ∠XJY + ∠JYX = 50°. If we can find another equation relating these angles, we might solve for them. But how?

Another thing to consider: points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear. So line WC contains all these points. The angle ∠WZG=20° suggests that line ZG makes a 20° angle with line WZ. Since Z is on line WC, this angle is between line WZ (part of line WC) and line ZG. So line ZG is making a 20° angle with line WC at point Z.

This might suggest that triangle ZWG has some properties. For example, if we can find other angles in that triangle. But again, without knowing where G is, it's challenging. However, since there's a mention of point G in the angle, perhaps G is connected to other points? Not sure yet.

Back to the main focus: angle at J. If we can express ∠IJH in terms of other angles, maybe we can find its measure.

Assuming triangles JIH and JXY are similar, then ∠IJH = ∠XJY. Let's denote ∠XJY as θ. Then, in triangle JXY, θ + ∠JYX = 50°, so ∠JYX = 50° - θ.

Now, considering triangle JIH, if it's similar to JXY, then the angles would be:

- ∠IJH = θ (as per similarity)

- The other angles would correspond accordingly. For example, ∠JIH would correspond to ∠JXY (which is 130°), so ∠JIH = 130°, and ∠IHY would correspond to ∠JYX = 50° - θ.

But then, in triangle JIH, the angles would be 130°, θ, and 50° - θ. Adding up: 130 + θ + (50 - θ) = 180°, which checks out. 

However, this doesn't directly give us the value of θ. Unless there's another relation. 

Wait, but we also have the angle ∠WZG=20°, which might tie into other parts. Let me think about line ZG. Since Z is on line WC, and angle at Z is 20°, maybe triangle ZWG has some connection to other parts. For example, if line ZG is creating an isoceles triangle or something. But without knowing where G is, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate angle ∠XJY (θ) to the given 20° angle. Suppose that line ZG is connected to point J somehow? Not sure. 

Wait, another possibility: since points X and Y are on line WC, and lines from X and Y go to J, forming triangle JXY. Also, line Z is on WC, so maybe there's a relationship between line ZJ and other elements. For example, if we draw line ZJ, which connects Z to J. Since Z is on WC, which is a straight line, and J is outside that line (since lines from X and Y to J form angles with WC).

But how does this help? Maybe considering triangle ZJW or something else. 

Alternatively, think about the exterior angles. For example, at point X, we have angle ∠WXJ=130°, which is an external angle to triangle JXY. Wait, no—point X is on line WC, and line XJ is forming an angle with WC. So maybe considering the straight line at X: the angle between XC (which is along WC) and XJ is 130°, implying that the other side of the straight line would have an angle supplementary to 130°, i.e., 50°, if extended. But not sure.

Alternatively, since points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, and line XJ forms a 130° angle with line WC (which is the line containing X). So if I extend line JC beyond J, maybe there's a relationship. But without more info, this is speculative.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point J. If we consider the various lines coming from J: IJ, HJ, XJ, YJ. Depending on their arrangement, the angles around J could add up to 360°. But unless we know the specific configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? Or some other property. 

Wait, going back to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. If we consider triangles JIH and JXY, and if they are similar, then their corresponding angles are equal. As before, ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ. Also, ∠JIH corresponds to ∠JXY, which is 130°, so ∠JIH = 130°. 

In triangle JIH, the angles are ∠IJH = θ, ∠JIH = 130°, and ∠IHY = 50° - θ. So the third angle at H is ∠IHY = 50° - θ. 

But how does this help us find θ? Unless there's another condition. 

Wait, maybe there's another angle given: ∠WZG=20°. Let me think about how this could relate. If line ZG forms a 20° angle with line WC, and since Z is on line WC, then line ZG makes a 20° angle with line WC. If we can relate this to other angles in the diagram. 

Perhaps there's a triangle involving Z and G that includes J? For example, if line ZG intersects with some other line connected to J. But without knowing where G is, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ZWG has some relationship with other parts. For instance, if line ZG is connected to point J indirectly. But without more info, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's consider the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This ratio suggests that point J lies on some kind of locus where this proportion holds. In particular, this resembles the definition of the angle bisector theorem. Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that if a line divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides, then it's the angle bisector. But here, we have a ratio of segments from J to other points, which might indicate some concurrency or similar triangles. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle XYZ, but not sure. 

Wait, another idea: since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, this suggests that J lies on the locus of points such that the ratio of distances to I and H is equal to the ratio of distances to X and Y. This might imply that J lies on the radical axis or something, but not sure. 

Alternatively, think of mass point geometry? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since the ratio is equal, maybe there's a parallelogram or something. 

Alternatively, since we have two triangles with proportional sides, and possibly equal included angles, leading to similarity. As discussed before, if ∠IJH = ∠XJY, then triangles JIH and JXY are similar. 

If that's the case, then ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ. And in triangle JXY, we had θ + ∠JYX = 50°. 

Now, if we can find ∠JYX, that would help. How?

Maybe look at triangle JYZ? Or other triangles. 

Wait, point Y is on line WC, and line YJ connects to J. Also, line YZ is part of line WC. So at point Y, we have line YJ and line YZ (along WC). So the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ. 

In triangle JYZ, we might be able to find some angles. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's difficult. 

Wait, but if we consider that line YZ is part of line WC, then the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ, which is an angle in triangle JYZ. 

But how does that relate to other angles? 

Alternatively, think about the straight line at Y. Since Y is on line WC, which extends to Z and C. So the line YZ is along WC. So the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ. 

If we can find ∠JYZ, then maybe we can relate it to other parts. 

But how? Let's think about triangle JXY again. We had angle at Y (∠JYX) = 50° - θ. Is ∠JYX the same as ∠JYZ? Not necessarily, unless X and Z are aligned in a certain way. 

Wait, points X and Y are consecutive on line WC, followed by Z. So from X to Y to Z. So line XY is part of line WC, and YZ is also part of line WC. So at point Y, the line YJ meets the line WC. Thus, the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ, which is the same as ∠JYX if X and Z are on the same line. Wait, but X is before Y, and Z is after Y. So at point Y, line YJ goes off to J, while line YZ continues toward Z. So the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ. 

But in triangle JXY, angle at Y is ∠JYX, which is between JY and YX. Since YX is part of line WC towards X, while YZ is part of line WC towards Z. So ∠JYX and ∠JYZ are supplementary if X and Z are on opposite sides of Y. 

Yes! Since X is on one side of Y (towards W), and Z is on the other side (toward C). So the angle between YJ and YX (∠JYX) plus the angle between YJ and YZ (∠JYZ) equals 180°. So ∠JYX + ∠JYZ = 180°. 

Earlier, in triangle JXY, ∠JYX = 50° - θ. So ∠JYZ = 180° - (50° - θ) = 130° + θ. 

Now, if we can find ∠JYZ, that might help. How? 

Well, if we consider line ZG making a 20° angle with line WC at point Z. So at point Z, the angle between ZW (along WC) and ZG is 20°. So ∠WZG=20°. 

If we can relate this to ∠JYZ, maybe through some triangle involving Z and G. 

Suppose line ZG forms a triangle with other points. For example, if line ZG intersects with J somehow. Or if line ZG is connected to J. 

But without knowing where G is, it's hard to say. However, since there's a point G mentioned in the angle, maybe there's a connection. Let's assume that line ZG is connected to point J. For instance, if line ZG passes through J, forming some triangle. 

But this is just speculation. Alternatively, maybe triangle ZGJ is involved. 

If we consider triangle ZGJ, we know one angle at Z is 20°, and maybe other angles could be related to ∠JYZ. 

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's still vague. 

Wait, but if we consider line ZJ, which connects Z to J. At point Z, we have line ZJ and line ZW (along WC), and angle between them is ∠WZJ. If we can find ∠WZJ, then we might relate it to other angles. 

But how? 

Let me consider that line ZJ connects to J, and we have line ZG making a 20° angle with ZW. If line ZG is connected to J, then maybe triangle ZGJ has some properties. 

Alternatively, since we have the angle at Z (∠WZG=20°), and if line ZJ is connected to J, then perhaps there's a relationship between angles at Z. 

For example, if line ZJ makes some angle with ZW, and line ZG makes 20° with ZW, then the angle between ZJ and ZG would depend on the direction of ZJ. 

But again, without knowing the exact position of J relative to Z, it's difficult to calculate. 

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to take a different approach. Let's revisit the assumption about the similar triangles. 

Assume that triangles JIH and JXY are similar due to the given ratio and included angles. If ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ, and in triangle JXY, θ + ∠JYX = 50°, and ∠JYX + ∠JYZ = 180°, then ∠JYZ = 130° + θ. 

Now, if we can find ∠JYZ in another way, we can set up an equation. 

Consider triangle JYZ. It has points J, Y, Z. At point Y, angle is ∠JYZ, which we said is 130° + θ. At point Z, we have line ZG making 20° with ZW. If line ZG is connected to J, then maybe triangle ZYG or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate ∠JYZ to other angles. 

Wait, what if line ZJ forms an angle with line ZW (which is part of WC)? Let's call that angle φ. So at point Z, between ZW and ZJ is φ. Then, since ∠WZG=20°, and if line ZG is on the same side as ZJ, then φ + 20° = 180°, or something like that. But this depends on the positioning. 

Alternatively, if line ZJ is such that φ is supplementary to ∠WZG. For example, if line ZJ and ZG are on opposite sides of ZW, then φ + 20° = 180°, so φ = 160°. But this is pure guesswork. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ZJW, but without knowing other angles, it's hard to say. 

This seems stuck. Maybe I need to reconsider the initial assumptions. 

Let me try to think differently. Since we have the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and assuming that this comes from similar triangles, then the included angles must be equal. So ∠IJH = ∠XJY. 

If I can find ∠XJY, then I can find ∠IJH. 

To find ∠XJY, which is angle at J in triangle JXY. Wait, no: ∠XJY is the angle at Y in triangle JXY. Wait, earlier confusion. Let me clarify once again:

In triangle JXY, the vertices are J, X, Y. So the angles are:

- At X: ∠JXY = 130° (given).

- At Y: ∠JYX.

- At J: ∠XJY.

So ∠XJY is the angle at J in triangle JXY. So, if ∠XJY = θ, then in triangle JXY, angles are 130°, ∠JYX, and θ, with θ + ∠JYX = 50°. 

Now, if we can find ∠JYX, then θ is known. 

How to find ∠JYX? 

At point Y, we have line YJ and line YZ (part of WC). So the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ. As before, ∠JYX + ∠JYZ = 180°, since X and Z are on opposite sides of Y. 

Thus, ∠JYX = 180° - ∠JYZ. 

If we can find ∠JYZ, then we can find ∠JYX, and hence θ. 

But how to find ∠JYZ? 

At point Y, line YZ is part of line WC, and line YJ goes to J. If we can find the angle between YJ and YZ, which is ∠JYZ. 

But without more information, this seems impossible. Unless there's another angle given involving Y. 

Wait, the problem mentions angle ∠WZG=20°. Maybe there's a way to relate this angle to ∠JYZ. 

Suppose line ZG is such that it creates a triangle with Y and J. For example, if line ZG passes through J, then we could relate angles. But without knowing where G is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if line ZG is parallel to some other line. 

Wait, let's think about the entire diagram. Points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear. Line XJ makes an angle of 130° with WC at X. Line YJ makes some angle at Y. Line ZG makes 20° with WC at Z. 

If I can find the slope or direction of lines XJ and YJ, maybe I can find some relationship. 

Alternatively, using the law of sines in triangle JXY. In triangle JXY, we have:

sin(∠JXY)/JY = sin(∠XJY)/XY = sin(∠JYX)/XJ.

But we don't know the lengths, but we do know the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. 

Wait, but if triangles JIH and JXY are similar, then their sides are proportional, and their angles are equal. So, if ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ, then in triangle JIH, the angles are 130°, θ, and 50° - θ, as before. 

But how does this help us? 

Unless there's another angle given that can be expressed in terms of θ. 

Wait, what about the angle at J in triangle JIH, which is ∠IJH = θ. But the question asks for m∠J. If ∠J refers to this angle, then θ is the answer. But how to find θ? 

Alternatively, maybe there's another angle that adds up to something. 

Wait, let's think about the full diagram. At point J, there are lines to I, H, X, Y. The angles around point J would depend on how these lines are arranged. 

If we consider the angles at J: 

- Between IJ and XJ: let's call this angle α.

- Between XJ and YJ: let's call this angle β.

- Between YJ and HJ: let's call this angle γ.

- And between HJ and IJ: let's call this angle δ.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to determine. However, if we assume that the lines from J to I, H, X, Y are arranged in a certain way, like I and H on one side, X and Y on the other. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, but earlier, we assumed that triangles JIH and JXY are similar, leading to ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ. If ∠IJH is one of the angles at J, then θ is the measure we need. 

But how to find θ? 

Let me recall that in triangle JXY, θ + ∠JYX = 50°, and ∠JYX = 180° - ∠JYZ. 

If we can find ∠JYZ in terms of other angles. 

At point Z, we have ∠WZG=20°. Let's assume that line ZG is such that it creates a triangle with Z and J. For example, if line ZG is connected to J, forming triangle ZGJ. In that case, we would have angles at Z, G, and J. 

But without knowing where G is, it's hard to proceed. However, since G is a point mentioned in the predicates, and there's a line from Z to G, perhaps it's part of another triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe line ZG is parallel to line IX or something. 

Alternatively, since the angle at Z is 20°, and if line ZJ makes some angle with ZW, then maybe we can relate it to other angles. 

Let me try to imagine extending line ZJ and seeing where it meets other lines. 

But this is getting too abstract. Perhaps I need to consider that the sum of angles around point J is 360°. If we can find the other angles at J, we can solve for the desired angle. 

Assume that at point J, the angles around it are:

- Between IJ and XJ: let's call this angle α.

- Between XJ and YJ: let's call this angle β.

- Between YJ and HJ: let's call this angle γ.

- Between HJ and IJ: let's call this angle δ.

So α + β + γ + δ = 360°.

But without knowing which angles are which, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if we consider that the lines from J to X and Y form part of triangle JXY, and the lines from J to I and H form part of triangle JIH, and if these triangles are similar, then perhaps some of these angles are related. 

For example, if ∠XJY = θ, and ∠IJH = θ, then maybe angle β (between XJ and YJ) is θ, and angle δ (between HJ and IJ) is something else. 

But this is still too vague. 

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the given angle at X is 130°, and the angle at Z is 20°, and these might be part of a larger triangle or something. 

For instance, if we consider triangle WZJ. At point Z, angle is 20°, and at point W, there's a line to X, which is part of line WC. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, and we have angles at X and Z, perhaps there's a transversal or something. 

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to look for another approach. 

Let me recall that in the given predicates, there is a line from Z to C, and points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear. Also, there's a point G with line ZG. Maybe G is somewhere on line WC? Or elsewhere? 

If G is on line WC, then ∠WZG=20° would be an angle at Z between WZ and ZG. If G is on line WC, then ZG is part of line WC, making the angle zero, which contradicts the given 20°. So G is not on line WC. 

Therefore, G is a separate point, not on line WC. So line ZG is a separate line from Z to G, making a 20° angle with line WC at Z. 

Now, if we consider triangle ZWG, with ∠WZG=20°, and line ZG. If we can relate this to other parts of the diagram. 

But without more information, it's hard to see. 

Maybe there's a way to use the Law of Sines in triangle ZWG. For example, if we can find other angles or sides. 

But again, without knowing any sides or other angles, this is difficult. 

At this point, I think I'm missing a key insight. Let me revisit the earlier assumption about similar triangles. 

Assume that triangles JIH and JXY are similar by SAS. This gives ∠IJH = ∠XJY = θ. In triangle JXY, θ + ∠JYX = 50°. 

If we can find ∠JYX, then we can find θ. 

But ∠JYX is the angle at Y in triangle JXY, which is also the angle between YJ and YX. Since YX is part of line WC, and YZ is also part of line WC, the angle between YJ and YZ is ∠JYZ = 180° - ∠JYX. 

Now, if we can relate ∠JYZ to other angles. 

At point Z, we have ∠WZG=20°, which is between ZW and ZG. If we can find the angle between ZJ and ZW, let's call it φ, then perhaps ∠JYZ is related to φ. 

For example, if line ZJ makes an angle φ with ZW, then at point Z, the angle between ZJ and ZW is φ, and the angle between ZW and ZG is 20°, so the angle between ZJ and ZG is |φ ± 20°|, depending on the direction. 

But without knowing φ, this is still not helpful. 

However, if we consider that line ZJ is part of some triangle or has some relation to other parts. 

Wait, what if line ZJ is parallel to line IG or something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and if we consider that this is the condition for a certain type of concurrency or something. 

Alternatively, think about vectors. Let me assign coordinates to points to calculate. 

Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to simplify calculations. 

Let me place point X at the origin (0,0). Since points W, X, Y, Z, C are collinear, let's put them on the x-axis. Let's say:

- Let’s set point X at (0,0).

- Since line WC is horizontal (for simplicity), let's assume it's the x-axis.

- Let’s define points W, X, Y, Z, C along the x-axis. Let's choose coordinates such that:

- Let’s say point W is at (-a, 0), X at (0,0), Y at (b, 0), Z at (c, 0), and C at (d, 0), where a, b, c, d > 0.

But to make calculations easier, let's choose specific values. Let's say:

- Let’s set point X at (0,0).

- Let’s set point Y at (1, 0).

- Let’s set point Z at (2, 0).

- Let’s set point C at (3, 0).

- Point W is to the left of X, say at (-1, 0).

Now, line XJ makes an angle of 130° with line WC (the x-axis). So at point X (0,0), the line XJ makes 130° with the positive x-axis. 

The angle between XJ and the x-axis is 130°, so the slope of XJ is tan(130°). 

Calculating tan(130°): 130° is in the second quadrant. tan(130°) = tan(180° - 50°) = -tan(50°) ≈ -1.191753592.

So the line XJ has slope approximately -1.19175. Let's denote this as m_XJ = -tan(50°).

Let me write this as m_XJ = tan(130°) = tan(π - 50°) = -tan(50°).

Now, let's find coordinates of J. Since X is at (0,0), and line XJ has this slope. Let's assume J is at some point (x, y) on this line. To make calculations easier, let's choose a specific length for XJ. Let's say XJ has length 1 unit for simplicity. 

But to avoid complexity, maybe assign coordinates such that J is at (0, tan(130°)) but wait, no. The line from X(0,0) with slope m_XJ would pass through J. Let's parameterize it.

Let’s say J is at (t, m_XJ * t), where t is some parameter. 

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since we need to relate to other points, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to J such that calculations are manageable. 

Alternatively, let's consider that line XJ makes 130° with x-axis, so the direction from X to J is 130° from x-axis. Let's say J is at (cos(130°), sin(130°)) scaled by some length. But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since we need to relate to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, maybe assigning coordinates to I and H. 

But this seems too open-ended. Let me try to proceed with coordinates.

Let’s fix coordinate system:

- Set point X at (0,0).

- Line WC is x-axis.

- Point Y is at (1,0).

- Point Z at (2,0).

- Point C at (3,0).

- Point W at (-1,0).

Now, line XJ makes 130° with x-axis. So the direction of XJ is 130° from x-axis. Let's choose J to be at (0,0) + some vector. Let's say J is at (0,0) + (cos(130°), sin(130°)) * k, where k is some scaling factor. Let's choose k=1 for simplicity. So J is at (cos(130°), sin(130°)) ≈ (cos(130°), sin(130°)) ≈ (-0.6428, 0.7660).

Now, we need to find coordinates of I and H such that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. 

First, calculate XJ length: since X is at (0,0) and J is at (cos(130°), sin(130°)), the length XJ is sqrt((cos(130°))^2 + (sin(130°))^2) = 1. So XJ = 1.

Now, Y is at (1,0), and we need HJ/YJ = IJ/XJ = 1. So HJ = YJ. 

Let me calculate YJ. Y is at (1,0), J is at (cos(130°), sin(130°)). So vector YJ is (cos(130°) - 1, sin(130°) - 0). The length YJ is sqrt[(cos(130°)-1)^2 + (sin(130°))^2]. 

Let me compute this:

Expand (cos(130°) - 1)^2 + sin²(130°):

= cos²(130°) -
