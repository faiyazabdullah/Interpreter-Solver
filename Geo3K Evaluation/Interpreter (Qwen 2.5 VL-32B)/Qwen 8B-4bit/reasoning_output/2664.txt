====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So the question is asking for the measure of angle B, given that m∠A is 10 degrees. Let me start by going through the given predicates and see what information I can extract.

First, there are several points mentioned: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Then there are lines connecting some of these points, like Line(A,J), Line(A,F), Line(B,F), etc. Also, there are triangles defined: Triangle(A,F,I), Triangle(B,F,G), Triangle(E,F,C). There's a quadrilateral A,B,C,D. And circles involved with point I being the center since there are radii lines from I to J, H, and G. Also, some points lie on the circle, like F, G, J.

Let me note down all the given angles and their measures. The problem states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,C)), 95) so ∠EFC is 95°. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,I)) is 15°, so ∠AFI is 15°. There's also RightAngle for Angle(J,I,A), Angle(H,I,G), and Angle(G,B,I). That means those three angles are 90° each. 

Also, there are perpendicular relationships: Line(J,I) is perpendicular to Line(A,J), so that forms a right angle at I. Similarly, Line(H,I) is perpendicular to Line(G,B), and Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). Wait, but Line(G,B) is already perpendicular to Line(I,G)? That would mean that the angle at G between lines G,B and G,I is 90°, which aligns with the RightAngle(Angle(G,B,I)).

Now, the main goal is to find the measure of ∠B. But wait, the question says "measure of ∠B". However, looking at the given points, there are several angles involving point B. For example, Angle(B,F,G) is given as a right angle? Wait, no, the RightAngle(Angle(G,B,I)) is stated. So angle at B between points G, B, I is a right angle. Wait, maybe that's different. Let me clarify.

Wait, the predicates say RightAngle(Angle(J,I,A)), which is the angle at I between J and A. Then RightAngle(Angle(H,I,G)) is the angle at I between H and G. And RightAngle(Angle(G,B,I)) is the angle at B between G and I. So that angle at B is 90°, so ∠GBI is 90°, meaning that lines GB and BI form a right angle at B.

But how does this relate to finding the measure of ∠B? Maybe ∠B refers to another angle, perhaps ∠ABF or something else. Wait, the problem mentions "measure of ∠B", but without more context, it could refer to various angles. However, in the given data, there's a Triangle(B,F,G), which has vertices B, F, G. So maybe ∠B here refers to ∠FBG, which is part of that triangle. Since we have a right angle at B in that triangle (∠GBI is right), but need to check.

Alternatively, maybe ∠B refers to ∠ABI or another angle. Hmm. Wait, the original question says "measure of ∠B if m∠A = 10". So maybe ∠A refers to one of the angles mentioned earlier. Wait, in the problem statement, they mention m∠A = 10. Which angle is that? Looking back, the initial setup includes Angle(A,F,I) which is given as 15°, but the question says m∠A is 10. So perhaps ∠A refers to another angle? Or maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the user wrote "if m∠A = 10" but in the given predicates, there's a measure of Angle(A,F,I) as 15°. So maybe the question is referring to a different angle labeled A. Wait, but in the problem, the points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. So angle A could be any angle where A is the vertex. For instance, in the given data, there's Angle(A,J,I) which is a right angle. Wait, but the user says "m∠A = 10", so maybe that refers to ∠JAI, which is given as a right angle (90°), but that contradicts. Therefore, there's a possibility that there's a typo or misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different angle A, such as ∠BAF or something else. Wait, but in the problem, the user may have intended that m∠A is referring to a certain angle that wasn't directly given. Wait, this needs clarification.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to ∠A as part of the quadrilateral ABCD. Since Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) is given, and Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D). So maybe ∠A refers to one of the internal angles of the quadrilateral. However, without knowing the type of quadrilateral, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, considering other angles. Let me re-examine the given information.

Looking back, there are several angles given:

- ∠EFC is 95°
- ∠AFI is 15°
- ∠JIA is a right angle (since RightAngle(Angle(J,I,A)))
- ∠HIG is a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(H,I,G)))
- ∠GBI is a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(G,B,I)))

Additionally, there are several lines and circles. Let me think about the diagram. Since I is the center of the circle because lines IJ, IH, IG are radii. Points J, H, G are on the circle. Also, lines FC, AF, BF are chords of the circle. So points F, C, A, B are on the circle. Because IsChordOf(Line(F,C), Circle(I)), IsChordOf(Line(A,F), Circle(I)), IsChordOf(Line(B,F), Circle(I)). So points A, B, C, F are on the circle centered at I. Also, points J, H, G are on the same circle. So the circle has radius IJ, IH, IG, and points A, B, C, F, G, H, J are on the circumference.

So, the circle with center I has several points on its circumference. Now, considering the triangles:

Triangle(A,F,I): This is formed by points A, F, I. Since A and F are on the circle, and I is the center, so IA and IF are radii. Therefore, IA = IF. Thus, triangle AFI is isoceles with IA = IF. Given that ∠AFI is 15°, which is the angle at F. In triangle AFI, since IA = IF, the base angles at A and F should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle AFI, sides IA and IF are equal (both radii). Therefore, the angles opposite them would be equal. Wait, side IA is opposite angle at F, and side IF is opposite angle at A. Wait, no: in triangle AFI, vertex A is connected to F and I. So the sides are AF, FI, IA. So IA and IF are two sides meeting at I. So the triangle has two sides equal: IA = IF. Therefore, the base angles are at A and F. Wait, but ∠AFI is the angle at F, which is given as 15°. So if triangle AFI has IA=IF, then ∠FAI = ∠AFI? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle AFI, the two equal sides are IA and IF. Therefore, the angles opposite those sides are equal. The side opposite angle at F is IA, and the side opposite angle at A is IF. Since IA = IF, then ∠A (at A) equals ∠F (at F). Wait, but ∠AFI is the angle at F, which would be equal to the angle at A. But the problem says that ∠AFI is 15°, so that would make ∠FAI also 15°, making the third angle at I equal to 180 - 15 -15 = 150°. But wait, the problem didn't state anything about ∠A in terms of this. However, the question says "if m∠A = 10", which might refer to this angle ∠FAI. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, if IA = IF, then ∠FAI = ∠AFI = 15°, but the question says m∠A is 10. This seems conflicting. Unless there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the angle referred to as ∠A is a different angle.

Wait, the problem says "measure of ∠B if m∠A = 10". So maybe ∠A here refers to another angle. Let me check again. The given Angle(A,F,I) is 15°, but the question refers to m∠A as 10. Perhaps there's a different angle labeled A. Wait, but the points are named A, B, C, etc., so ∠A could be any angle with vertex at A. For example, ∠JAI (from the right angle at I), or ∠BAF, or others. However, since the problem mentions m∠A = 10, but in the given data, ∠AFI is 15°, which is part of triangle AFI. So this suggests that maybe there's a typo or mislabeling. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to ∠JAI, which was initially considered as a right angle. Wait, but that's given as a right angle, so that would be 90°, which doesn't fit. 

This is confusing. Let me try to look for other clues. The question asks for the measure of ∠B. Given the presence of right angles and the circle, maybe we can use properties of circles and triangles. Let me consider the triangle BFG. Wait, Triangle(B,F,G) is given. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(G,B,I)), which is part of that triangle? Wait, point I is connected to G and B via Line(I,G) and Line(I,B)? No, the Line(G,B) is connected to point G and B, and Line(I,G) is connected to I and G. So the angle at B between G and I is a right angle. So in triangle BGI, which is a right triangle at B. But how does that connect to the rest?

Alternatively, maybe we need to consider the cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. Since points A, B, C, F are on the circle centered at I. So, for example, arcs subtended by chords AF, BF, etc. 

Given that ∠AFI is 15°, and since IA and IF are radii, then the arc from A to F would correspond to twice that angle? Wait, the central angle over arc AF would be ∠AIF. Wait, in the circle, the central angle corresponding to arc AF is ∠AIF. Since IA and IF are radii, the angle between them is the central angle. Earlier, we thought that ∠AFI is 15°, but if IA = IF, then in triangle AFI, angles at A and F are equal. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that ∠AFI is 15°, which would make ∠FAI = 15°, leading to ∠AIF = 180 - 15*2 = 150°. Therefore, the central angle over arc AF is 150°, which would imply that the inscribed angle over the same arc would be half that, so 75°. But I'm not sure yet how this connects.

Also, there's ∠EFC = 95°, which is an inscribed angle. Since points E, F, C are on the circle (as per IsChordOf(Line(E,F), Circle(I))? Wait, no, the chord is Line(E,F), but the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(E,F), Circle(I)). Wait, the line EF is a chord of the circle centered at I. Therefore, points E and F are on the circle. So E is also on the circle. So points A, B, C, E, F, G, H, J are all on the circle centered at I. 

Therefore, the circle passes through many points. Now, the angle ∠EFC is an inscribed angle. The arc it subtends would be arc EC. The measure of ∠EFC is half the measure of the arc EC. So if ∠EFC is 95°, then arc EC is 190°, which is impossible because the total circumference is 360°, and arcs can't exceed 360°. Wait, that can't be. Wait, inscribed angles are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. So if ∠EFC is 95°, then the arc EC would be 190°, which is possible. So arc EC is 190°, which implies that the arc from E to C passing through the opposite side of the circle is 190°, leaving the other arc EC as 170°, but that depends on the position of E and C.

Now, returning to the problem. The question is about finding the measure of ∠B. Assuming that ∠B refers to some angle involving point B. Let me check the given triangles again. Triangle(B,F,G) exists. Also, there's a right angle at B between G and I (Angle(G,B,I) is right). So in triangle BGI, which is right-angled at B. Also, points B, F, G are connected by lines. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. Points A, B, C, D are vertices of a quadrilateral. Points F, G, H, J are on the circle with center I. Lines connecting various points. 

Another thing to note: since I is the center of the circle, lines IA, IB, IC, IF, IG, IH, IJ are all radii, so they are equal in length. Therefore, IA = IB = IC = IF = IG = IH = IJ. 

Now, considering triangle AFI: IA = IF, so it's isoceles. As before, ∠AFI = 15°, so ∠FAI = 15°, making ∠AIF = 150°, as previously calculated. 

Similarly, if we consider triangle BFI: since IB and IF are radii, so IB = IF. Therefore, triangle BFI is also isoceles with IB = IF. Therefore, the base angles at B and F are equal. Let's denote ∠IBF = ∠IFB. But we don't know the measure of ∠IBF yet. 

However, there's a right angle at B between G and I (Angle(G,B,I) = 90°). So the line BG is perpendicular to BI. Wait, since Angle(G,B,I) is a right angle, that means that BI is perpendicular to BG. Therefore, in triangle BGI, which is right-angled at B. 

But how does this relate to other parts? Let me think about the entire configuration. 

Since points B and F are on the circle, and I is the center, then BF is a chord of the circle. The line BI is a radius, so it goes from center I to point B. Similarly, IF is a radius. So, in triangle BFI, we have two radii IB and IF, so it's isoceles. 

Now, if we can find the measure of ∠BFI, which would be the angle at F in triangle BFI. But how? 

We also have the right angle at B between G and I. So BI is perpendicular to BG. Therefore, BG is perpendicular to BI. So BG ⊥ BI. Therefore, angle between BG and BI is 90°, which is ∠GBI. 

But how does BG relate to other elements? Maybe there's a connection between BG and BF. 

Alternatively, considering the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate the angles. Let me attempt that approach. 

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since I is the center of the circle. Let me assume the circle has radius r. Let me assign coordinates to points based on the given information. 

For example, point J lies on the circle and is connected to I. Since Line(I,J) is a radius, and there's a right angle at I between J and A (Angle(J,I,A) is right). So line IA is perpendicular to line IJ. Therefore, if I is at (0,0), and assuming line IJ is along the x-axis, then line IA would be along the y-axis. So suppose IJ is horizontal, so J is at (r, 0). Then IA is vertical, so A is at (0, r). 

But then, Line(A,F) is a chord of the circle. So point F is somewhere on the circle. Also, ∠AFI is 15°, which is the angle at F between points A, F, I. 

Let me try to find coordinates for point F. Since A is at (0, r), I is at (0,0), and F is a point on the circle. The angle ∠AFI is 15°. Let's compute that. 

In triangle AFI, IA = IF = r. So triangle AFI is isoceles with IA = IF. The angle at F is 15°, so the base angles at A and F are equal. Wait, earlier calculation said that if IA = IF, then angles at A and F are equal. Wait, no—wait, in triangle AFI, the sides adjacent to angle at F are FI and FA. Wait, no, the sides are IA, IF, and AF. Since IA and IF are equal (both radii), then the angles opposite them are equal. The angle opposite IA is at F, and the angle opposite IF is at A. Therefore, ∠AFI = ∠FAI. But the problem says ∠AFI is 15°, so ∠FAI is also 15°, making the remaining angle at I equal to 180 - 15 -15 = 150°. 

Thus, ∠AIF = 150°, which is the central angle for arc AF. Therefore, the arc AF measures 150°, implying that the inscribed angle subtending the same arc would be 75°. But I'm not sure yet how that helps. 

Now, moving to point B. Since IB is a radius, and there's a right angle at B between G and I. Let me try to find coordinates for B. Suppose that line BI is perpendicular to BG. So BG is perpendicular to BI. If I can find the direction of BI, then BG would be perpendicular to it. 

Alternatively, since there's a triangle BFG. Let me think about the relationship between points B, F, and G. 

Also, there's a right angle at B between G and I. So, if I can express the coordinates of B, G, and I, then maybe I can find relations. 

Assume I is at (0,0). Let me take radius r = 1 for simplicity. So I = (0,0), J = (1,0), A = (0,1). Now, point F is on the circle. From earlier, arc AF is 150°, so the central angle ∠AIF = 150°. Therefore, point F is located at an angle of 150° from point A. 

Since point A is at (0,1), which is 90° from the positive x-axis. Adding 150° to that would give the angle for point F. Wait, central angle between A and F is 150°, so starting from point A (which is at angle 90°), rotating 150° counterclockwise around the circle would place point F at angle 90° + 150° = 240°. So polar coordinates for F would be (cos(240°), sin(240°)) = (-0.5, -√3/2). 

So coordinates:

I = (0,0)

A = (0,1)

F = (-0.5, -√3/2)

Now, we need to find coordinates for B. Since IB is a radius, point B is somewhere on the circle. Also, there's a right angle at B between G and I. Let me think about point G. Since Line(I,G) is a radius, so G is also on the circle. Also, there's a right angle at B between G and I, which implies that BI is perpendicular to BG. 

So vector from B to I is I - B = (0 - Bx, 0 - By). Vector from B to G is G - B = (Gx - Bx, Gy - By). These vectors are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: ( -Bx)(Gx - Bx) + (-By)(Gy - By) = 0 → -Bx(Gx - Bx) - By(Gy - By) = 0 → -BxGx + Bx² - ByGy + By² = 0 → Bx² + By² - BxGx - ByGy = 0. 

But since B and G are both on the circle centered at I with radius 1, so Bx² + By² = 1 and Gx² + Gy² = 1. Substituting into the equation:

1 - BxGx - ByGy = 0 → BxGx + ByGy = 1. 

So the dot product of vectors OB and OG is 1, where O is the origin (point I). 

But since both B and G are on the unit circle, their dot product is cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So cos(theta) = 1 → theta = 0°, which would mean B and G are the same point, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me recheck. 

The condition is that BI is perpendicular to BG. BI vector is from B to I: I - B = (-Bx, -By). BG vector is from B to G: G - B = (Gx - Bx, Gy - By). Their dot product should be zero:

(-Bx)(Gx - Bx) + (-By)(Gy - By) = 0

Expanding:

- BxGx + Bx² - ByGy + By² = 0

Which simplifies to:

Bx² + By² - BxGx - ByGy = 0

But since B is on the circle, Bx² + By² = r². Assuming r=1, then:

1 - BxGx - ByGy = 0 → BxGx + ByGy = 1.

But since G is also on the circle, Gx² + Gy² = 1. 

But unless B and G are the same point, this equation isn't generally true. So either there's an error in the logic, or there's more constraints. 

Perhaps I need to consider that there's another relationship involving point G. For example, Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G), which is given by the predicate Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)). So Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). 

Wait, Line(I,G) is from I to G, which is a radius. Line(G,B) is from G to B. So the slope of Line(I,G) is (Gy - 0)/(Gx - 0) = Gy/Gx. The slope of Line(G,B) is (By - Gy)/(Bx - Gx). These slopes multiply to -1 because they are perpendicular. 

So [(Gy/Gx)] * [(By - Gy)/(Bx - Gx)] = -1. 

But this seems complicated to handle algebraically. Maybe instead of coordinates, we can use angles. 

Let me consider that since Line(I,G) is a radius, and Line(G,B) is perpendicular to it. So the line from G to B is perpendicular to the radius at G. This implies that line GB is tangent to the circle at G. Wait, no—the property that a line is tangent to a circle at a point is that it is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So if Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G), then line GB is tangent to the circle at G. Hence, point B lies on the tangent to the circle at G. 

But since B is also on the circle (because IsChordOf(Line(B,F), Circle(I)), so B is on the circle. Therefore, point B lies on the tangent at G and also on the circle. The only way this is possible is if B coincides with G, but that would make Line(G,B) undefined. So there must be a mistake here. 

Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)). So Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G), which means that the line from G to B is perpendicular to the radius at G. Hence, line GB is tangent to the circle at G. But since B is on the circle, the only way for B to be on the tangent line at G and also on the circle is if B=G, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests an inconsistency. 

Wait, but maybe I misunderstood the predicate. Let me check again. The predicate says: Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)). So Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). So line GB is perpendicular to line IG. So this is the condition for tangency. But since B is on the circle, and GB is perpendicular to IG, then GB is indeed the tangent line at G, so B lies on the tangent line at G. However, since B is on the circle, the only intersection point of the tangent at G with the circle is G itself. Hence, B must coincide with G. But this contradicts the existence of distinct points B and G. Therefore, there's a contradiction, suggesting that my assumptions are incorrect. 

Hmm, this indicates that perhaps my coordinate assignment is wrong, or there's a misunderstanding of the predicates. Let me re-examine the predicates. 

The predicate says: Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)). So Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). Therefore, the line from G to B is perpendicular to the line from I to G. This means that line GB is perpendicular to the radius at G. Hence, GB is tangent to the circle at G. Therefore, B lies on the tangent at G. But since B is also on the circle, this implies that B=G. But since B and G are distinct points (they are separate vertices), this is impossible. 

This suggests that there is an error in the problem setup, or perhaps a misinterpretation of the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the line from G to B is not necessarily intersecting the circle at B, but B is on the circle, and GB is perpendicular to IG. 

Wait, but if GB is perpendicular to IG, and B is on the circle, then GB is tangent to the circle at G. Hence, the only point on the tangent line at G that is also on the circle is G itself. Therefore, B must be G. But this contradicts the given that B and G are distinct points. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, or I've misinterpreted the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the line from G to B is not the tangent but another line. Let me think differently. 

Maybe the line from G to B is not the tangent, but just a secant line that is perpendicular to the radius at G. But that would require B to be such that GB is perpendicular to IG. For example, if B is diametrically opposite to G, then the line from G to B would pass through I, making it a diameter, and hence not perpendicular to IG. 

Alternatively, if B is placed such that the line GB is perpendicular to IG. Let me imagine point G on the circle. The radius IG is from center I to G. To have line GB perpendicular to IG, point B must lie somewhere such that GB is perpendicular to IG. This would mean that B lies on the line perpendicular to IG at G. So, the set of all points B such that GB is perpendicular to IG is the line perpendicular to IG at G. Since B is also on the circle, the intersection of this line with the circle gives possible positions for B. 

Let me visualize this. Take point G on the circle. Draw the tangent at G, which is perpendicular to IG. Any point B on the tangent line at G will satisfy that GB is perpendicular to IG. However, the only common point between the tangent line and the circle is G itself. Therefore, B cannot be on the tangent line except at G. Hence, this suggests that B=G, which is impossible. 

This contradiction implies that there's an error in the problem's predicates, or perhaps I have misread something. Let me double-check the predicates. 

The predicates include: Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)), and IsChordOf(Line(B,F), Circle(I)). So Line(B,F) is a chord of the circle, implying B is on the circle. Additionally, Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). 

Wait, unless Line(G,B) is not a straight line from G to B, but rather another line. Wait, no, Line(G,B) is the line segment between G and B. So this is perplexing. 

Perhaps the issue is that the line from G to B is not a chord but intersects the circle at another point. Wait, but if B is on the circle, and GB is perpendicular to IG, then as discussed earlier, B must be G. 

Unless there's a misunderstanding of the predicate. Could it be that the line from G to I is perpendicular to the line from B to G? That is, Perpendicular(Line(G,I), Line(B,G))? Which would mean that Line(G,I) is perpendicular to Line(B,G). 

Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(I,G)). So Line(G,B) is perpendicular to Line(I,G). So yes, that means the line from G to B is perpendicular to the line from I to G. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps there's an error in the problem, or perhaps the line from I to G is not a radius? Wait, but the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(I,G), Circle(I)), so Line(I,G) is a radius. 

This suggests that the problem contains contradictory information, making it unsolvable. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake. 

Let me try to proceed differently. Assume that despite the contradiction, there's a way to resolve it. Let me think about the right angle at B between G and I. So, ∠GBI is 90°, which means that triangle BGI is right-angled at B. Therefore, by Pythagoras, BG² + BI² = GI². But since BI and GI are both radii of the circle, BI = GI = r. Therefore, BG² + r² = r² → BG = 0, which implies that G=B. Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that the problem as given contains inconsistent information, which is unlikely. Hence, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the line from G to B is not the segment but the infinite line? Even so, the condition would still require that line GB is tangent to the circle at G, forcing B to be G. 

Alternatively, maybe the line from G to B is not the segment, but another line. Wait, but the predicate specifies Line(G,B), which is the line containing points G and B. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to the apparent contradiction. Perhaps I should focus on other parts of the problem. 

Let me return to the angle measures given. We know that ∠EFC is 95°, which is an inscribed angle. So the arc EC measures 190°, as mentioned earlier. 

Also, ∠AFI is 15°, which is an angle at F in triangle AFI. 

If I can find relationships between these angles and the desired angle at B, perhaps I can find a way forward. 

Let me recall that in the circle, the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. For example, arc AF is 150°, as determined earlier. If I can find other arcs, maybe I can find relationships. 

Also, since point E is on the circle, and ∠EFC = 95°, which is the inscribed angle subtending arc EC. So arc EC is 190°, as before. 

Now, considering that points A, B, C, D are part of a quadrilateral. Maybe the quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic? But since all points A, B, C, D are on the circle, yes, it's a cyclic quadrilateral. 

In cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum to 180°. However, we don't have enough information about angles of the quadrilateral. 

Alternatively, focusing on triangle BFG. If I can determine some angles in this triangle, perhaps. 

But I'm missing crucial information about the configuration. Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradiction, perhaps I should try to proceed with the given information, assuming that there's a way to resolve the contradiction, and focus on the parts that are consistent. 

Let me try to find the measure of ∠B, assuming that it refers to ∠GBI, which is given as a right angle (90°). But the question says "measure of ∠B", which might refer to this angle. However, the question also states that m∠A = 10, which might be a different angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to ∠ABF. Let me consider that. 

If ∠A is 10°, and ∠AFI is 15°, and there's a relationship between these angles. 

In triangle AFI, we had ∠AFI = 15°, ∠FAI = 15°, ∠AIF = 150°. If ∠A is referring to ∠FAI, which is 15°, but the question says m∠A = 10°, so this is inconsistent. 

Alternatively, if ∠A refers to another angle, like ∠JAI, which is a right angle (given as RightAngle(Angle(J,I,A))). But that's 90°, which doesn't fit. 

This suggests that there's a disconnect between the given information and the question, possibly due to a misprint or misunderstanding. However, since the problem is to be solved, I'll need to make assumptions. 

Let me assume that the question intends to ask for the measure of ∠GBI, which is given as a right angle (90°), but this is not among the options. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 35, C. 47.5, D. 90. Option D is 90°, which fits the right angle. But the question says "if m∠A = 10", which might be a red herring or unrelated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for ∠ABF, and with m∠A = 10, we can find it. 

Let me try this approach. Assume that ∠A refers to ∠BAF, which is part of triangle ABF. 

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's challenging. 

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress on the contradictions, I'll proceed to the answer choices. Since the right angle at B is 90°, and option D is 90°, but the question says "if m∠A = 10", which might suggest that ∠A is not the right angle. However, if the question is asking for ∠B, and there's a right angle at B, then the answer is D. But the presence of m∠A = 10 might indicate that the answer is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of ∠B is 90° - 10° = 80°, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, using the given angles: ∠EFC = 95°, ∠AFI = 15°, and some relationships. 

Let me consider that in triangle BFG, if we can find some angles. 

Assuming that ∠GBI is 90°, and if we can find other angles in triangle BGI or BFG. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an answer, I'll go with option D, 90°, as it corresponds to the right angle at B, even though the question mentions m∠A = 10. Perhaps the 10° is a distraction or part of a different calculation.
