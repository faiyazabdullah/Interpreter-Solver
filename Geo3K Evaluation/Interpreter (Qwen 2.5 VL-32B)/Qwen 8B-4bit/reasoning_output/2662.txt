MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle L, and points I, H, J, K, G. The problem says that HK and IG are diameters of circle L. Also, there's a right angle at ILJ. We need to find the measure of arc IHJ. Wait, the question is about the measure of arc IHJ? Or maybe it's the measure of angle IHJ? Wait, the original question says "m ∠IHJ" – wait, no, looking back: the user wrote "Find m ∠I H J." Oh, so it's the measure of angle IHJ. Wait, but the initial problem mentions arc IHJ? Wait, no, the original question is written as "m ∠I H J", which is angle IHJ. But let me check again. Wait, the user wrote "Find m ∠I H J." So it's angle IHJ. Hmm. Let me make sure I parse this correctly.

First, the given predicates: IsDiameterOf(Line(H,K), Circle(L)) and IsDiameterOf(Line(I,G), Circle(L)). So, HK and IG are diameters of circle L. Therefore, points H and K are endpoints of one diameter, and I and G are endpoints of another diameter. Also, RightAngle(Angle(ILJ)), so angle ILJ is a right angle. So point L is the center of the circle? Because if HK and IG are diameters, then their intersection point would be the center. Wait, but the circle is named L. Wait, the circle is called L. Wait, the first predicate is Circle(L). So the circle has name L, so the center of the circle is point L? Wait, no. Wait, in standard notation, a circle is usually denoted by its center. For example, if we say circle L, then L is the center. Wait, but the points are also labeled I, H, J, K, G. So perhaps point L is the center. Wait, because the diameters are HK and IG, so their midpoints would be the center. So since HK and IG are diameters, their midpoint is the center of the circle. However, the circle is named L. So does that mean that point L is the center? That seems likely. So point L is the center of the circle.

So, if that's the case, then the diameters HK and IG pass through the center L. Therefore, points H, K, I, G are all on the circle, and L is the center. Now, the other predicate is RightAngle(Angle(ILJ)). So angle ILJ is a right angle. Let me visualize this. Points I, L, J. So angle at point L between points I and J. Wait, no. Angle ILJ means vertex at L, with segments LI and LJ. So angle at L between points I and J. And that angle is a right angle. So triangle ILJ is a right-angled triangle at L. Since L is the center, and I and J are points on the circle. Wait, but where is point J located?

Wait, we need to find the measure of angle IHJ. Wait, the question is m∠IHJ. So angle at point H, between points I and J. So vertex at H, with sides HI and HJ. So we need to find the measure of that angle.

Let me start by drawing a diagram mentally. There's a circle with center L. Diameters HK and IG. So, points H and K are endpoints of a diameter, so they're opposite each other through L. Similarly, points I and G are endpoints of another diameter. So, since L is the center, then HL = LK and IL = LG, because those are radii. So HL and IL are radii. Now, angle ILJ is a right angle. So point J must be somewhere on the circle such that when connected to L and I, forms a right angle at L.

Wait, angle ILJ is at point L. So lines LI and LJ form a right angle. So, since LI is a radius (from center L to point I), and LJ is another radius (from center L to point J). Therefore, angle between two radii LI and LJ is 90 degrees. So, the arc between points I and J would be 90 degrees. Because the central angle corresponding to arc IJ is equal to the measure of the central angle between them, which is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc IJ measures 90 degrees.

But how does this relate to angle IHJ? Let's think. Point H is one endpoint of diameter HK, so H is on the circle. We need to consider triangle IHJ, specifically angle at H. Let me recall some circle theorems. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Alternatively, if we can find the arcs involved, we can compute the angle.

Alternatively, since H is on the circle, and I and J are also points on the circle. Let me try to find the arcs that relate to angle IHJ.

Angle IHJ is formed by points I, H, J. The vertex is at H. So, this is an inscribed angle. Wait, but inscribed angles subtend arcs. So angle at H between I and J would intercept an arc. Which arc? The arc from I to J that doesn't contain H. Wait, depending on the position of H relative to I and J.

But since H is on the circle, and I and J are points on the circle. Let me try to think of coordinates to model this. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let’s place the center L at the origin (0,0). Then, since HK and IG are diameters, let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Suppose diameter HK is horizontal. Let me set H at (-a, 0) and K at (a, 0), making L the center at (0,0). Then, diameter IG is another diameter. Let me choose IG to be vertical for simplicity. So point I could be at (0, b) and G at (0, -b). But then angle ILJ is a right angle. Wait, point J is another point on the circle. Wait, but where is point J?

Wait, angle ILJ is at point L (the center). So, angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees. Since LI is from center L to I, which in my coordinate system would be along the y-axis (if I is at (0,b)). Then, LJ is another radius forming a right angle with LI. So, if LI is along positive y-axis, then LJ would be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Wait, but angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees, so direction depends on orientation.

Assuming LI is up the y-axis, then LJ would be either along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Suppose we take LJ along positive x-axis. Then point J would be at (c, 0), but that would be same as point H if c is a. Wait, but H is at (-a, 0) and K at (a, 0). So if J is at (a, 0), that's point K. But that may not be helpful. Alternatively, if LJ is along positive x-axis, then J would be at (d, 0), but since it's on the circle, d must be ±a. But that would conflict with existing points. Alternatively, maybe J is not aligned with the axes. Wait, but angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees. So if LI is along y-axis, then LJ would be along x-axis. Therefore, point J would be at (a, 0) or (-a, 0). But those are points H and K. But then angle ILJ would be between LI (up y-axis) and LJ (along x-axis). For instance, if J is at (a, 0), then angle ILJ would be between LI (point I at (0, b)) and LJ (point J at (a, 0)). The angle between vectors LI and LJ would be 90 degrees. Wait, but in that case, if LI is along y-axis and LJ is along x-axis, then yes, the angle between them is 90 degrees. So that works.

So assuming this setup, let me define coordinates. Let me take radius r=1 for simplicity. So center L is at (0,0). Let me take H at (-1, 0), K at (1, 0). Then, diameter IG: suppose I is at (0,1) and G at (0,-1). Then, angle ILJ is at L (center) between I(0,1) and J. To make angle ILJ a right angle, J should be at (1,0) or (-1,0). But (1,0) is point K. So if J is point K, then angle ILJ is between LI (from L to I=(0,1)) and LK (from L to K=(1,0)), which is indeed a right angle. So angle ILJ is 90 degrees. So in this case, J is point K. But then angle IHJ is angle at H between points I, H, J. If J is K, then angle IHJ is angle at H between I and K. So points I=(0,1), H=(-1,0), K=(1,0). So angle at H between I and K.

Let me calculate that angle. In this coordinate system, point H is (-1,0), I is (0,1), and K is (1,0). So angle IHJ is the angle at H between points I, H, K. So vectors HI and HK. Vector HI goes from H(-1,0) to I(0,1): (0 - (-1), 1 - 0) = (1,1). Vector HK goes from H(-1,0) to K(1,0): (1 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (2, 0). So angle between vectors (1,1) and (2,0).

To find the angle between these two vectors, use the dot product formula:

cosθ = (v · w)/(|v| |w|)

v = (1,1), w = (2,0)

Dot product = 1*2 + 1*0 = 2

|v| = sqrt(1² + 1²) = √2

|w| = sqrt(2² + 0²) = 2

So cosθ = 2/(√2 * 2) = 2/(2√2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071

Therefore θ = 45 degrees. But wait, in this scenario, the angle IHJ is 45 degrees. However, none of the answer choices include 45. The options are A.59, B.135, C.270, D.301. So something is wrong here. Either my assumption is incorrect, or I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, but in this configuration, angle IHJ came out as 45 degrees. But that's not among the answer choices. So perhaps my assumption that J is point K is incorrect. Wait, why did I assume J is point K? Because angle ILJ being right angle implies that J lies along the x-axis. But there are two possibilities: J could be at (1,0) or (-1,0). But if J is at (-1,0), which is point H. Then angle ILJ would be between LI (from L to I=(0,1)) and LJ (from L to J=(-1,0)), which is also a right angle. So in that case, J is point H. But then angle IHJ would be undefined, since J coincides with H. So that's not possible. Hence, J must be at (1,0), which is point K. But that leads to angle IHJ being 45 degrees, which isn't an option. Therefore, my coordinate assumption is flawed. Where is the error?

Wait, the problem states that angle ILJ is a right angle. In my setup, that requires J to be at K or H, but that leads to angle IHJ being 45°, which isn't an option. So maybe my coordinate assignment is too restrictive? Perhaps the diameters HK and IG aren't perpendicular? Wait, but if they are diameters of the same circle, their relationship isn't necessarily perpendicular unless specified. Wait, but the problem didn't state that HK and IG are perpendicular. The only thing given is that both are diameters. So maybe in reality, the angle between the diameters HK and IG isn't 90 degrees, but the angle ILJ is 90 degrees. Wait, but how?

Let me re-examine. The angle ILJ is a right angle, where L is the center. So, in general, if I and J are points on the circle, and L is the center, then angle ILJ being 90 degrees implies that arc IJ is 90 degrees. Because the central angle between I and J is 90 degrees. So arc IJ measures 90 degrees. So regardless of where H is, that's fixed.

Now, we need to find angle IHJ. Let's think about this angle. It's an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle IHJ is formed by points I, H, J. So, vertex at H, with segments HI and HJ. So, this is an inscribed angle? Wait, but H is on the circumference, so HI and HJ are chords. The measure of angle IHJ would be half the measure of the arc IJ that it intercepts. Wait, but which arc? Depending on where H is located relative to I and J.

Since H is on the circle, and I and J are also on the circle. Let me recall the Inscribed Angle Theorem: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if angle IHJ intercepts arc IJ, then its measure would be half of arc IJ. But arc IJ is 90 degrees (as per earlier conclusion), so angle IHJ would be 45 degrees. Again, leading us to 45 degrees, which isn't an option. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, but maybe the angle IHJ intercepts a different arc. For example, if H is positioned such that the angle IHJ intercepts arc IJ that's the major arc instead of minor arc. But in that case, the measure would be half the difference of the arcs. Wait, no. The inscribed angle intercepts the arc that is opposite to the angle. If the angle is formed by two chords, then it intercepts the arc between the two points that is not containing the vertex. So, depending on the position of H, the intercepted arc could be the minor arc IJ or the major arc IJ. 

In our previous coordinate example, H was at (-1,0), I at (0,1), J at (1,0). So the intercepted arc would be arc IJ passing through the lower part of the circle. From I(0,1) to J(1,0), going clockwise through the bottom. But the arc length would depend on the position. Wait, but in that case, the minor arc IJ is 90 degrees, while the major arc IJ would be 270 degrees. So angle IHJ would be half of the intercepted arc. But which arc does it intercept?

If the angle is at H, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite to H. So imagine standing at H, looking at I and J. The arc that doesn't contain H. So, if H is at (-1,0), and I is at (0,1), J is at (1,0), then the arc from I to J that doesn't pass through H would be the arc going from I(0,1) to J(1,0) through the upper-right quadrant. Wait, but that's still minor arc IJ of 90 degrees. Wait, but if you go the other way around the circle, passing through H, that would be the major arc. So the angle IHJ would intercept the minor arc IJ of 90 degrees, giving angle IHJ as 45 degrees. But again, that's not in the answer choices.

Hmm. This suggests that my understanding is missing something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the angle IHJ is not an inscribed angle, but something else. Wait, angle IHJ has vertex at H, so it's an inscribed angle if the vertex is on the circle. Yes, so it should be an inscribed angle. Unless... unless H is not on the circle. Wait, but H is an endpoint of diameter HK, so H is on the circle. So that's not the issue.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc isn't IJ. Let me think again. The inscribed angle at H between I and J would intercept arc IJ that doesn't contain H. Wait, but if the arc IJ is 90 degrees, then angle IHJ would be half of that. But 90/2 is 45, which is not an option. So this suggests that either the intercepted arc is not IJ, or my assumption that arc IJ is 90 degrees is wrong.

Wait, why did I assume that arc IJ is 90 degrees? Because angle ILJ is a right angle, which is a central angle. Central angle equals arc measure. So if angle ILJ is at the center, then arc IJ is 90 degrees. That seems correct. So why is there inconsistency?

Perhaps the problem is that angle IHJ is not an inscribed angle. Wait, no, because it's at point H on the circle. So it must be an inscribed angle. So why isn't the answer matching?

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says "Find m ∠I H J". So the angle at H between I and J. But maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate example. Let me recalculate that angle.

In the coordinate system where H is (-1,0), I is (0,1), J is (1,0):

Vector HI is from H to I: (0 - (-1), 1 - 0) = (1,1)

Vector HJ is from H to J: (1 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (2,0)

So angle between vectors HI and HJ. Earlier calculation said 45 degrees, but let me verify again.

The formula is cos(theta) = (HI • HJ) / (|HI| |HJ|)

HI • HJ = (1)(2) + (1)(0) = 2

|HI| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)

|HJ| = sqrt(2^2 + 0^2) = 2

Thus, cos(theta) = 2 / (sqrt(2)*2) = 1/sqrt(2) => theta = 45 degrees. Correct.

So why isn't this matching the answer choices? Maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem. Let me read the problem again.

Given: HK and IG are diameters of circle L. RightAngle(Angle ILJ). Need to find m∠IHJ.

Wait, maybe the angle IHJ is not an inscribed angle, but an external angle? Or maybe it's referring to an arc that includes more than just IJ? Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the angle IHJ is actually an inscribed angle intercepting arc IJ plus some other arc. Or perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which arc is intercepted.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not formed by points I, H, J in the order I-H-J, but in another order. Wait, the notation ∠IHJ means the angle at H between points I and J. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the circle isn't assumed to have HK and IG as perpendicular diameters. Wait, in my previous example, they were perpendicular, but maybe they are not. Wait, the problem doesn't state that HK and IG are perpendicular. They are just diameters. So in that case, the angle between diameters HK and IG could vary. But the presence of the right angle at ILJ imposes a condition.

Wait, let's think again. The right angle at ILJ means that angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees. Since L is the center, LI and LJ are radii, so the arc IJ is 90 degrees. Thus, arc IJ is 90 degrees, regardless of where H is. So even if the diameters HK and IG are not perpendicular, as long as angle ILJ is 90 degrees, arc IJ is 90 degrees.

Now, to find angle IHJ. Let's consider that H is on the circle. Let's consider the circle with center L, and points I and J separated by 90 degrees. Let's pick arbitrary positions for H. Let's suppose that H is somewhere on the circle, not overlapping with I or J. Then, angle IHJ would depend on the position of H relative to arc IJ.

For example, if H is on the arc IJ that is opposite to the arc IJ (i.e., on the opposite side of the circle), then angle IHJ would be half the measure of arc IJ. But if H is on the arc that contains arc IJ, then it would be half the difference of the arcs.

Wait, no. The measure of an inscribed angle is always half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. So if H is on the circle, and we have points I and J, then the angle at H intercepts the arc IJ that does not contain H. So if arc IJ is 90 degrees, and H is on the opposite arc, then angle IHJ is 45 degrees. But if H is on the same arc as IJ, then it would intercept the rest of the circle.

Wait, but in this case, the total circle is 360 degrees. Arc IJ is 90 degrees. If H is on the arc that is opposite to arc IJ (i.e., the arc that spans from I to J through the side opposite to H), then the intercepted arc is 90 degrees, and angle IHJ is 45 degrees. But if H is on the arc IJ itself, then the intercepted arc would be the remaining part of the circle. For example, if H is on arc IJ, then the intercepted arc would be the arc from I to J that doesn't pass through H, which is the minor arc IJ of 90 degrees, so angle IHJ would still be 45 degrees. Wait, but that contradicts the idea that H being on arc IJ would change things. Wait, no—if H is on arc IJ, then the intercepted arc would be the other arc. For example, if H is between I and J, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc IJ. But in this case, arc IJ is 90 degrees, so the major arc IJ would be 360 - 90 = 270 degrees. Then angle IHJ would be half of 270, which is 135 degrees. Ah! So this is the key. Depending on where H is located, the intercepted arc changes.

So, if H is on the arc IJ (the minor arc), then the angle IHJ intercepts the major arc IJ, which is 270 degrees, making the angle IHJ = 270/2 = 135 degrees. If H is on the opposite arc, then it intercepts the minor arc IJ (90 degrees), making angle IHJ = 45 degrees. 

But how do we know where H is located? Well, H is an endpoint of diameter HK. So, H is on the circle. Let me think about the position of H relative to arc IJ. 

Since HK is a diameter, H and K are opposites. So if I can determine whether H is on the arc IJ or not, I can decide which arc is intercepted.

But how can we determine that? Let's see. Given that HK is a diameter, and angle ILJ is 90 degrees. Let's try to relate H's position to arc IJ.

Let me consider that arc IJ is 90 degrees. Let me imagine the circle with center L, points I and J separated by 90 degrees. Let me assume that H is somewhere on the circle. Now, since HK is a diameter, H and K are directly opposite each other. So, if I can find the position of H relative to arc IJ, I can determine the intercepted arc.

But without knowing the exact positions of H, I, J, it's hard to tell. However, there might be a relation due to the fact that HK is another diameter. Let me think about the possible configurations.

Let me consider that since HK is a diameter, and IG is another diameter, and angle ILJ is 90 degrees. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram.

Since L is the center, and HK and IG are diameters. Let me assume that diameters HK and IG intersect at L. So, points H and K are on opposite ends of the circle, and points I and G are on opposite ends of another diameter. Now, angle ILJ is a right angle. Since L is the center, and J is a point on the circle. 

Wait, earlier, I thought J might be point K, but that led to angle IHJ being 45 degrees. But if J is not on the same diameter as H, then perhaps the intercepted arc is different.

Wait, perhaps J is not on diameter HK. Let me consider that. Since angle ILJ is 90 degrees, and L is the center, then J is a point on the circle such that arc IJ is 90 degrees. Now, H is on diameter HK. So, depending on the placement of H, it could be on the arc IJ or not.

Let me consider two cases:

Case 1: H is on the arc IJ (minor arc). Then, angle IHJ intercepts the major arc IJ, which is 270 degrees, so angle IHJ is 135 degrees.

Case 2: H is not on arc IJ, so it's on the opposite arc. Then, angle IHJ intercepts the minor arc IJ, which is 90 degrees, so angle IHJ is 45 degrees.

But which case applies? How can we determine where H is?

Well, since HK is a diameter, and H is one endpoint. Let me consider the position of H relative to arc IJ.

Let me try to think about the entire circle. The diameters HK and IG divide the circle into four parts. Since angle ILJ is 90 degrees, arc IJ is 90 degrees. So, the arc from I to J is 90 degrees. Now, H is on the circle, and HK is a diameter. So, if I can find the relationship between the diameters HK and IG, I can determine where H is.

But the problem doesn't specify the relationship between diameters HK and IG. They are just two diameters of the circle. However, the existence of angle ILJ being 90 degrees might impose a constraint on their positions.

Wait, but in this case, since I and J are points such that arc IJ is 90 degrees, and H is an endpoint of another diameter, we need to find the location of H. Without loss of generality, let's assume that the diameters HK and IG are arranged in such a way that H is on the arc that is opposite to arc IJ.

Wait, but how can we ensure that? Let me think of a specific example. Let me take the circle with center L at (0,0), radius 1. Let me set point I at (1,0), so diameter IG goes from (1,0) to (-1,0). Wait, but then angle ILJ would require J to be at a point where arc IJ is 90 degrees. If I is at (1,0), then J could be at (0,1), making arc IJ 90 degrees. Now, H is an endpoint of diameter HK. Let me choose H at (0,-1), making diameter HK from (0,-1) to (0,1). Wait, but then HK would be a vertical diameter. In this case, H is at (0,-1). Now, angle IHJ is angle at H between I(1,0) and J(0,1).

So, points I(1,0), H(0,-1), J(0,1). Let me calculate angle IHJ. This angle is at H(0,-1), between points I(1,0) and J(0,1).

Vectors HI and HJ:

From H(0,-1) to I(1,0): vector (1-0, 0 - (-1)) = (1,1)

From H(0,-1) to J(0,1): vector (0-0, 1 - (-1)) = (0, 2)

So angle between vectors (1,1) and (0,2).

Compute the cosine of the angle:

Dot product: 1*0 + 1*2 = 2

|HI| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = √2

|HJ| = sqrt(0^2 + 2^2) = 2

Cos(theta) = 2 / (√2 * 2) = 1/√2 → theta = 45 degrees. Again, same result.

But in this case, H is at (0,-1), which is on the opposite side of the circle from arc IJ (which is from (1,0) to (0,1)). So, the intercepted arc would be arc IJ of 90 degrees, making angle IHJ 45 degrees. Still not matching answer choices.

Wait, but in this case, if H is on the arc opposite to arc IJ, then the intercepted arc is 90 degrees, leading to 45 degrees. If H is on arc IJ, then the intercepted arc would be major arc IJ of 270 degrees, leading to angle IHJ of 135 degrees. So, which one is it?

How can we determine whether H is on arc IJ or not? It depends on the arrangement of the diameters. But the problem doesn't give explicit information about the positions of the diameters HK and IG relative to arc IJ. However, since both HK and IG are diameters, and angle ILJ is 90 degrees, perhaps there's a relation between them.

Wait, in this case, if I is at (1,0), J is at (0,1), and H is at (0,-1), then diameter HK is from (0,-1) to (0,1), which is the vertical diameter. Diameter IG is from (1,0) to (-1,0), which is the horizontal diameter. So, in this case, diameters HK and IG are perpendicular, forming a cross. In this configuration, angle ILJ is 90 degrees, as required. But here, H is at (0,-1), which is on the opposite arc from IJ.

But if we move H to a different position, like if H is at (1,0), then it would coincide with I, which is not allowed. Or if H is at (something else). Wait, let me choose another configuration where H is on arc IJ.

Let me take the same circle, center at (0,0), arc IJ from (1,0) to (0,1), 90 degrees. Let me choose H to be on arc IJ. Let's say H is at (0,1), which is point J. No, that would make H coincide with J. Not allowed. Let me pick H at (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is on the circle, on the arc IJ. So, H is at (approx 0.707, 0.707). Now, angle IHJ is at H between I(1,0) and J(0,1).

Calculating this angle: vectors HI and HJ.

HI: from H to I: (1 - sqrt(2)/2, 0 - sqrt(2)/2)

HJ: from H to J: (0 - sqrt(2)/2, 1 - sqrt(2)/2)

This seems complicated, but let's compute the angle.

Alternatively, since H is on arc IJ, the intercepted arc is the major arc IJ of 270 degrees. So, angle IHJ would be 270/2 = 135 degrees. This is one of the answer choices, option B. So in this case, the answer would be 135 degrees. 

But how do we know whether H is on arc IJ or not? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe the configuration is such that H is on arc IJ. Why? Because the problem gives us that HK is a diameter, and if H is on arc IJ, then the diameter HK passes through H and K, where K is the opposite point. But without additional constraints, it's ambiguous. However, given that the answer choices include 135 degrees, which is option B, it suggests that this is the intended answer. 

But why would H be on arc IJ? Maybe due to the configuration of the diameters. Let me think: since HK and IG are diameters, and angle ILJ is 90 degrees, which places J such that arc IJ is 90 degrees. Now, if H is on the same diameter as I or G, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: since HK is a diameter, and H is one end, then K is the opposite end. Let me consider that the angle IHJ is determined by the position of H relative to arc IJ. But without more info, it's ambiguous. However, since the answer choices include 135 degrees, which corresponds to the case where H is on the arc IJ, and given that in many problems, such configurations often involve H being on the arc IJ, I'll proceed under that assumption.

Therefore, the measure of angle IHJ is 135 degrees, which is option B. So the answer is B.
