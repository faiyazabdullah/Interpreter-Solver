<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of the shaded region. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup.

So, there's a circle with center O. Points A, B, E are mentioned. Lines OE, OB, AB, BE, EA are present. There's an angle at point B between points O and E, which measures 30 degrees. The radius of the circle is 5 units. Also, it mentions that Line OE and Line OB are radii of the circle, so that confirms OA, OB, OE are all radii since they're connected to the center O. 

Then there's a shaded region defined as Shape(Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B))). So this seems like a sector formed by arc AE and the line AB? Wait, maybe it's a segment or a sector combined with a triangle? Or perhaps a region bounded by the arc AE and the chord AB? Hmm, but the description says Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)). Arc(A,E,O) probably refers to the arc from A to E passing through O? Wait, but O is the center, so if we have points A and E on the circle, then the arc from A to E would normally be part of the circumference. But the notation Arc(A,E,O) might mean the arc starting at A, ending at E, with O being the center. That would make sense because O is the center, so the arc AE would be part of the circle centered at O. Then combining that with Line(A,B). So the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and the line AB. That sounds like a circular segment or a sector minus a triangle?

Wait, also, there's a Sector(O,E,A) mentioned, which is a sector with center O, spanning from E to A. Since O is the center, the sector OEA would be the sector formed by points O, E, and A. But the shaded region is described as Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)). Maybe the shaded region is the area between the arc AE and the line AB? Let me visualize this.

Points A and E are on the circle with center O. Line AB connects A to B. Since B is another point, maybe it's inside the circle? Because there's a Triangle(O,B,E) mentioned. So triangle OBE has vertices O, B, E. And angle at B is 30 degrees. Wait, the Angle(O,B,E) is 30 degrees. So in triangle OBE, angle at B is 30 degrees. Also, since OB and OE are radii of length 5 each, making triangle OBE an isosceles triangle with OB=OE=5 and angle at B being 30 degrees. 

But how does this relate to the shaded region? The shaded region is the Region formed by Arc(AE) and Line AB. So maybe it's the area between arc AE and the chord AB? Which would be a segment of the circle. However, since AB is a line connecting A to B, and B isn't necessarily on the circle. Wait, but if B is a point such that OB is a radius, then B is on the circle. Wait, the predicate IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(O)) means that line OB is a radius, so point B lies on the circle. Similarly, OE is a radius, so E is on the circle. Therefore, points A, B, E are all on the circle. Wait, but then line AB connects two points on the circle. So the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and line AB. That would form a segment of the circle. Alternatively, maybe it's a sector minus a triangle. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the shaded region could be the area of the sector OAE minus the area of triangle OAB? Or something like that. Wait, the Region is defined by Arc(A,E,O) and Line(A,B). So the arc from A to E passing through O? Wait, O is the center, so the arc AE would typically be the minor arc unless specified otherwise. But if the arc passes through O, that suggests that the arc goes from A to E via the center O. Wait, that doesn't make sense because O is the center, not a point on the circumference. So maybe the arc is from A to E, and the line AB is another boundary. So the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and line AB. That would form a sort of lens shape or a segment depending on where B is located.

But to find its area, I need more details about the position of B. Given that there's a triangle OBE with angle at B being 30 degrees. Since OB and OE are both radii of length 5, triangle OBE has sides OB = OE = 5, and angle at B is 30 degrees. Using the Law of Sines or Cosines here might help find other angles or sides.

Let me start by analyzing triangle OBE. In triangle OBE, we know two sides are radii, so OB = OE = 5. The angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me denote the triangle as follows: vertex B, with angle 30°, sides OB and BE. Wait, but in triangle OBE, the vertices are O, B, E. So angle at B is ∠OBE = 30°, sides adjacent to this angle are BO and BE. Wait, BO is one side (OB = 5), and BE is another side. We can use the Law of Sines here. Let's write down:

In triangle OBE,

∠OBE = 30°,
OB = 5,
OE = 5.

Wait, but OE is the side opposite angle B? No, in triangle OBE, the side opposite angle B is OE. Wait, angle at B is between sides BO and BE. So the side opposite angle B is OE. So applying Law of Sines:

sin(∠OBE)/OE = sin(∠BOE)/BE

Wait, maybe better to assign variables. Let me call:

Let’s denote:

∠OBE = 30° (given).

We need to find other angles or sides.

Since triangle OBE has two sides: OB = 5, OE = 5. Wait, wait—wait, OE is a radius, yes, but BE is not necessarily a radius. Wait, hold on. Wait, OE is a radius (since it's a line from O to E, which is on the circle). OB is also a radius. So in triangle OBE, sides OB and OE are both radii, hence equal. Therefore, triangle OBE is isosceles with OB = OE = 5. Therefore, the base is BE, and the two equal sides are OB and OE. Wait, but angle at B is given as 30°, so that would mean that the apex angle at O is... Let me calculate.

In triangle OBE, since it's isosceles with OB = OE, then angles at B and E should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Here, OB and OE are the two equal sides. Wait, OB is adjacent to angle at E, and OE is adjacent to angle at B. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me draw the triangle mentally. Points O, B, E. OB and OE are both radii, so they are equal in length. So triangle OBE has OB = OE, so it's an isosceles triangle with legs OB and OE, and base BE. Therefore, the base angles at B and E are equal. But wait, the given angle is at B, which is 30°, so angle at E would also be 30°, and the remaining angle at O would be 180 - 2*30 = 120°. So ∠BOE = 120°.

Therefore, the measure of angle at O, which is ∠BOE, is 120 degrees. Now, since O is the center of the circle, the arc BE corresponding to this central angle would be 120 degrees. But how does this relate to the shaded region?

Now, the shaded region is defined as Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)). Assuming that Arc(A,E,O) refers to the arc from A to E passing through O. But O is the center, not a point on the circumference, so that might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Arc(A,E) without the O? Or maybe it's referring to the arc AE that subtends the angle at O. Wait, if points A and E are on the circle, then the arc AE would correspond to the central angle ∠AOE. But we don't know that angle yet. However, there's also the presence of point B connected to A, forming line AB, which is part of the shaded region.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and the line AB. To compute that, we might need to find the area between arc AE and chord AB. This would require knowing the angle subtended by arc AE at the center, then computing the area of the sector minus the area of triangle AEB or something similar. But first, I need to find the measure of angle AOE, which is the central angle for arc AE.

But how do I find angle AOE? Well, maybe there's some relationship between points A, B, E, and O. For example, since B is a point on the circle (as OB is a radius), and there's a line AB connecting A to B. Also, there's a line BE connecting B to E. From earlier, we found that ∠BOE is 120°, so the arc BE is 120°, which implies that the arc length from B to E along the circle is 120°. 

Now, considering the entire circle, if we can find the positions of points A and E relative to B, maybe we can find the angle AOE. However, I need more information. Let me check the given predicates again.

There's also a mention of the shaded region involving Line(A,B). So AB is a chord of the circle. Also, there's a Sector(O,E,A), which is a sector with central angle ∠EOA. So sector OEA is the sector from E to A with center O. Therefore, the angle ∠EOA is the central angle for arc EA. If I can find that angle, then the area of the sector would be (θ/360)*πr². 

But how to find θ = ∠EOA? Let me see if there's a way to relate points A, B, E. Since there's a line AB and BE, perhaps triangle ABE is involved? Or maybe triangle OAB? Wait, but I don't know much about point A except that it's on the circle (since OA is a radius, as per IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Circle(O))? Wait, wait, looking back at the predicates: IsRadiusOf(Line(O,E), Circle(O)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(O)). Are there any others? The initial list includes Point(A), so Line(O,A) may or may not be a radius. Wait, the original predicates mention:

- Line(O,E)
- Line(O,B)
- Line(A,B)
- Line(B,E)
- Line(E,A)

And the Circle(O), with radius 5. Also, the predicate IsRadiusOf(Line(O,E), Circle(O)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(O)). It doesn't explicitly say that Line(O,A) is a radius. Wait, but if the shaded region involves Arc(A,E,O), maybe that implies that A is also on the circle? Because otherwise, the arc from A to E passing through O wouldn't make sense. So assuming that A is on the circle, so OA is a radius. Therefore, OA = 5, same as OB and OE. So points A, B, E are all on the circle with center O, each at distance 5 from O.

Given that, let me consider the positions of these points. Let me imagine the circle with center O. Points A, B, E are on the circumference. We have triangle OBE with ∠OBE = 30°, and ∠BOE = 120°, as previously determined. Now, what about point A? How is it positioned relative to B and E?

The shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and line AB. So if I can find the angle ∠AOE, then the area of the sector OAE would be (angle / 360) * π * r². Then subtract the area of triangle OAB or something similar to get the shaded region. Wait, but the shaded region is bounded by arc AE and line AB. So it's the area between arc AE and chord AB. That would be the area of the sector AOE minus the area of triangle AOE, but that would give the segment AE. However, the shaded region is bounded by arc AE and line AB, not chord AE. So if AB is not the chord AE, but another chord, then the shaded region is a different shape.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the union of the sector OAE and the triangle ABE or something? Not sure. Let me think again.

The Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)) likely refers to the area enclosed by the arc AE (which is part of the circle) and the line AB. So this would create a region that starts at A, follows the arc AE to E, then goes back along line EB to B, then along line BA to A? Wait, no, the line AB is just from A to B. So the shaded region is bounded by arc AE and line AB. So it's like a region that starts at A, follows the arc AE to E, then connects back to A via line AB? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's bounded by arc AE and the line AB, implying that the region is between those two boundaries. That would suggest that the shaded region is the area between the arc AE and the line AB, which would require that AB intersects the arc AE at A and another point? Or maybe AB is tangent to the arc?

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the intersection of the sector OAE and the triangle OAB? Not sure. Maybe I need to look at the given predicates again. There's also a Triangle(O,B,E) mentioned, which we've already analyzed. 

Another thought: since the shaded region is mentioned as Shaded(Shape(Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)))), maybe it's a combination of the arc AE and the line AB, forming a kind of segment-like region. For instance, if AB is a chord from A to B, and the arc AE is part of the circle from A to E, then the shaded region might be the area between arc AE and chord AB. But for that to happen, point B must lie somewhere on the arc AE or extend beyond it. 

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and the line AB, which would imply that B is outside the arc AE, creating a sort of lens shape. But without a diagram, this is challenging. 

Perhaps I need to find coordinates for points A, B, E to model this. Let me attempt coordinate geometry. Let's place point O at the origin (0,0). Let me assume the circle has radius 5. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, E based on the given angles and relationships.

First, let's fix point B. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let's set point B at (5,0) since OB is a radius. Then, since angle ∠OBE = 30°, and OE is another radius (point E is also on the circle), we can find coordinates for E. In triangle OBE, with OB = 5, OE = 5, angle at B is 30°, so we can find the coordinates of E.

Using polar coordinates, since we placed B at (5,0), let's find the location of E. The angle at B is 30°, so in triangle OBE, with OB and OE both length 5, angle at B is 30°. Let me use the Law of Cosines to find BE. Wait, in triangle OBE, sides OB=5, OE=5, angle at B=30°. Wait, but angle at B is between sides OB and BE. So using the Law of Cosines on triangle OBE:

OE² = OB² + BE² - 2*OB*BE*cos(angle at B)

Wait, but OE is known as 5, OB is 5. Let me rearrange:

5² = 5² + BE² - 2*5*BE*cos(30°)

Which simplifies to:

25 = 25 + BE² - 10*BE*(√3/2)

Subtract 25 from both sides:

0 = BE² - 5√3 * BE

Thus, BE² - 5√3 BE = 0 → BE(BE - 5√3) = 0 → BE = 0 or BE = 5√3. Since BE ≠ 0, BE = 5√3. 

So the length of BE is 5√3. Now, with this information, I can find coordinates for E. Since point B is at (5,0), and O is at (0,0). Let me find coordinates for E. 

Let me consider vectors. The vector from B to E is BE. Let me find the angle that BE makes with respect to the x-axis. Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of O and B, we can use trigonometry.

Alternatively, since we know the central angle ∠BOE is 120°, as previously determined. Wait, earlier calculation said that ∠BOE is 120°, because in triangle OBE, angles at B and E are equal? Wait, no. Earlier, I thought that triangle OBE was isosceles with OB=OE=5, hence angles at B and E are equal. But ∠OBE is given as 30°, so ∠OEB would also be 30°, making ∠BOE = 180 - 30 - 30 = 120°. So the central angle between points B and E is 120°, so the arc BE measures 120°. Therefore, if I place point B at (5,0), then point E would be located at an angle of 120° from point B around the circle. Wait, but direction matters. Since the central angle ∠BOE is 120°, moving counterclockwise from OB to OE is 120°, so point E would be located at an angle of 120° from OB. Since OB is along the positive x-axis, point E would be at an angle of 120° from the positive x-axis. Thus, coordinates of E would be (5 cos 120°, 5 sin 120°). Calculating:

cos 120° = cos(180°−60°) = -cos 60° = -0.5  
sin 120° = sin(180°−60°) = sin 60° = (√3)/2  

So coordinates of E are (5*(-0.5), 5*(√3/2)) = (-2.5, (5√3)/2). 

Now, we need to determine the position of point A. The shaded region involves arc AE, so point A must be another point on the circle. However, the problem doesn't specify its position directly. Perhaps there's more information in the other predicates. 

Looking back, there's a Line(A,B) and Line(E,A). So points A and E are connected by line EA, and point B is connected to A. Additionally, there's a Sector(O,E,A), which is a sector with endpoints E and A, implying that the arc from E to A is part of the circle. So the central angle for arc EA is ∠EOA. To find this angle, we might need to find the angular position of A relative to E and O.

However, without explicit information about point A, I need to infer its position. Perhaps there's a relation between points A, B, and E? For instance, maybe line AB is related to the previous triangle or something else. 

Alternatively, since there's a line EA and line AB, maybe triangle ABE is significant. Let me consider that. If I can find the coordinates of A, I can proceed. But how?

Wait, there's a shaded region involving arc AE and line AB. Let me suppose that the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and line AB, which would be a segment if AB is a chord. To compute its area, I need to know the central angle for arc AE, then compute the area of the sector minus the area of triangle AEB or something similar. However, without knowing where A is, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but there's a Sector(O,E,A) mentioned. This sector is part of the circle, so the central angle ∠EOA is the angle between points E and A as viewed from O. If I can find this angle, then I can compute the area of the sector. 

But how to find ∠EOA? Let me think. Suppose that point A is positioned such that line AB creates some relation with existing elements. For example, maybe AB is perpendicular to something, or forms a certain angle. But without explicit info, this is tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's a connection between points A, B, and E through the line AB and BE. For instance, if I can find the measure of angle EAB or something. Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE relates to other parts. 

Alternatively, since we know points B and E's coordinates, and line AB exists, perhaps we can express point A in terms of coordinates. Let me assume that point A is somewhere on the circle, and line AB connects A to B. The shaded region depends on where A is. 

Wait, but since there's a Sector(O,E,A), which is a sector of the circle, that suggests that points E and A are distinct points on the circle, and the arc EA is part of the circle. So the central angle between E and A is ∠EOA. Let me denote this angle as θ. Then the area of the sector OEA is (θ/360) * π * r² = (θ/360) * π * 25. 

The shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and line AB. If AB is a chord from A to B, then the shaded region might be the area of the sector OEA minus the area of triangle OAB. Wait, but why? Let me visualize: if you have a sector OEA (arc AE and radii OA and OE), and then connect A to B, which is another point on the circle. Depending on where B is, this could form different regions. 

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and the chord AB, which would be a segment of the circle. But that requires that AB is a chord intersecting the arc AE. For example, if A and B are two points on the circle, then AB is a chord, and the arc AE is another arc. 

This is getting too abstract without more concrete relations. Let me try another approach. Since the problem gives us several fixed elements: radius 5, angle at B in triangle OBE is 30°, and asks for the area of the shaded region involving arc AE and line AB. 

Maybe the shaded region is the area of the sector OAE minus the area of triangle OAB. Let me explore this possibility. 

Assuming that, I need to find the area of sector OAE and subtract the area of triangle OAB. But to do this, I need to find the angle ∠AOE (for the sector) and the area of triangle OAB. 

How can I find ∠AOE? If I can relate point A to other points. 

Wait, there's a line EA, so point A is connected to E. And there's a line AB. If I can find the measure of angle at E or something else. 

Alternatively, since there's a line EA and line AB, maybe triangle EAB is involved. But without more data, this is difficult. 

Wait, but there's a Sector(O,E,A) mentioned, which is a sector with central angle ∠EOA. So that angle is θ, and the area of that sector is (θ/360)*π*r². If I can find θ, then I can compute the sector area. 

But how to find θ? Let me recall that earlier, we determined the central angle between B and E is 120°, i.e., ∠BOE = 120°. If I can find the position of point A relative to B and E, maybe through some other relationships. 

Alternatively, since there's a line AB, and points A and B are on the circle, then AB is a chord of the circle. If I can find the length of AB or the angle subtended by AB at the center, that could help. 

But without more information, I need to make assumptions or find another way. 

Wait, perhaps there's a missing piece. Let me review all given predicates once more:

- Circle(O)
- Point(A)
- Point(B)
- Point(E)
- Line(O,E)
- Line(O,B)
- Line(A,B)
- Line(B,E)
- Line(E,A)
- Angle(O,B,E) = 30°
- Radius of Circle(O) is 5
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O,E), Circle(O))
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(O))
- Sector(O,E,A)
- Triangle(O,B,E)

Wait, there's also a Sector(O,E,A), which means the sector from E to A with center O. So this sector's central angle is ∠EOA. So if I can find ∠EOA, then I can compute the area of the sector. 

But how to find ∠EOA? Let me think about the total circle. The sum of all central angles around point O should be 360°. We know that ∠BOE is 120°, as computed before. If we can find other angles, maybe we can find ∠EOA. 

For example, if points A, B, and E are arranged such that the arcs between them add up to 360°. But without knowing the position of A, this is still unclear. 

Wait, but there's also line EA and line AB. If I consider triangle EAB, but again, without more info on angles or sides, this is hard. 

Alternatively, maybe point A is such that line AB is tangent to the circle at A? No, because line AB connects A (on the circle) to B (also on the circle), so it's a chord, not a tangent. 

Another idea: since the shaded region is bounded by arc AE and line AB, maybe AB is a radius? No, because B is already on the circle, and OA is a radius. 

Wait, if AB is a chord, then the shaded region is the area between arc AE and chord AB. This would be the area of the sector OAE minus the area of triangle OAE, but that would give the segment AE. But if instead, the shaded region is between arc AE and chord AB, then it's a different segment. 

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area bounded by arc AE and the chord AB, which would require that AB is not a radius, but a chord. To compute this, we'd need the central angle for arc AE and the length of AB. 

But without knowing where A is, I'm stuck. Wait, but maybe there's a relation between points A and B through the line AB and other elements. For example, if line AB is related to the triangle OBE or something else. 

Wait, there's a line EA and line AB, so point A is connected to both E and B. So triangle EAB exists. Let me consider triangle EAB. Points E and B are on the circle, and point A is also on the circle. So triangle EAB is inscribed in the circle. The angle at A might relate to the arcs. 

But without knowing any angles or sides of triangle EAB, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something. 

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of B and E, maybe we can find coordinates for A such that line AB is connected. 

Let me try to assign coordinates to point A. Let me assume that point A is at some angle θ from the positive x-axis. Since O is at (0,0), and the circle has radius 5, coordinates of A would be (5 cos θ, 5 sin θ). 

Now, line AB connects A to B (at (5,0)). The equation of line AB can be written parametrically. Also, line EA connects E to A, where E is at (-2.5, (5√3)/2). 

But how does this help? Maybe I need to ensure that line EA and line AB meet at A, which they do by definition. But I still don't know where A is. 

Wait, the problem states that the shaded region is Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)). So this region is defined by the arc from A to E passing through O (but O is the center, not on the circumference, so this might be a misinterpretation). Alternatively, it might be the arc from A to E, and the line AB. 

Assuming that the arc AE is the arc from A to E not containing B, then the central angle for that arc is ∠AOE. If I can find ∠AOE, I can compute the sector area. 

But how to find ∠AOE? Let me think about the full circle. We know ∠BOE is 120°, as calculated earlier. If I can find ∠AOB or ∠AOE, I can relate them. 

Wait, if I can find the angle between OA and OB, that would help. Let me assume that point A is positioned such that line AB is connected to B, and there's some relationship. 

Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry. Suppose that point A is symmetric to point B with respect to some axis. But without more info, this is speculative. 

Wait, maybe the shaded region's area is the same as the sector OBE minus some part? But that's not clear. 

At this point, I realize I might be missing a crucial piece of information. Let me revisit the predicates. There's a Sector(O,E,A) and Triangle(O,B,E). Also, the shaded region is mentioned as Shaded(Shape(Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)))). 

Wait, perhaps the shaded region is the area common to the sector OEA and the triangle OAB? Or maybe it's the area of the sector OEA plus or minus something. 

Alternatively, since there's a Sector(O,E,A), which is part of the circle, and the shaded region is defined by that arc and line AB, perhaps the shaded region is the area of the sector OEA minus the area of triangle OAB. Let me try this approach. 

To do this, I need to find the area of sector OEA and subtract the area of triangle OAB. 

First, find the central angle ∠EOA. Let's assume that ∠EOA is x degrees. Then the area of sector OEA is (x/360) * π * 5² = (x/360)*25π. 

Next, the area of triangle OAB. To find this, I need to know the angle at O between OA and OB, which is ∠AOB. If I can find ∠AOB, then the area of triangle OAB is (1/2)*OA*OB*sin(∠AOB) = (1/2)*5*5*sin(∠AOB) = (25/2)*sin(∠AOB). 

But how to find ∠AOB? Let me think. If I can relate ∠AOB to other angles. 

Earlier, we had ∠BOE = 120°. If I can find the angle between OA and OE, which is ∠EOA = x, and if I can relate ∠AOB to x and ∠BOE, then maybe. 

Assume that points A, B, and E are arranged around the circle such that the total angles around O add up to 360°. For example, if I can find the angle between OA and OB, and between OB and OE, and between OE and OA, they should add up to 360°. 

But I know ∠BOE = 120°, so if I can find ∠AOB and ∠EOA, then ∠AOB + ∠BOE + ∠EOA = 360°. But without knowing ∠AOB or ∠EOA, this is still two variables. 

Wait, but if there's a relation between ∠AOB and other angles. For example, if line AB is connected to point B, and there's a line EA. Maybe there's a triangle or something. 

Alternatively, if I consider triangle ABE. Since points A, B, E are on the circle, the angles in this triangle relate to the arcs. For example, ∠ABE would be half the measure of arc AE. Wait, but I don't know ∠ABE. 

Alternatively, since we know coordinates of B and E, and if we can find coordinates of A, we could calculate ∠AOB. 

Let me try this approach. Assume that point A is somewhere on the circle, and line AB connects it to B at (5,0). Let me parameterize point A as (5 cos θ, 5 sin θ). Then, line AB goes from (5 cos θ, 5 sin θ) to (5, 0). 

But how does this help? Without additional constraints, θ can be any angle. 

Wait, but there's a line EA connecting E to A. Point E is at (-2.5, (5√3)/2). So the line EA goes from E to A. Maybe this line has some property? Like being a radius, or forming a particular angle? 

Alternatively, since there's a Sector(O,E,A), which is a sector with endpoints E and A, it implies that the arc from E to A is part of the circle. This arc corresponds to central angle ∠EOA. 

If I can find this angle, then I can proceed. 

But without more information, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption about the shaded region. 

Wait, the shaded region is defined as Region(Arc(A,E,O), Line(A,B)). Maybe it's the area bounded by the arc AE and the line AB, which would form a segment. To calculate this, I need the central angle for arc AE and the length of AB. 

But without knowing where A is, I cannot calculate this. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate this to the given angle at B. Since angle ∠OBE = 30°, and we've calculated BE = 5√3, maybe there's a way to relate this to other parts. 

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the area of the sector OEA minus the area of triangle OAB. Let me try to proceed with this assumption, even though I don't know ∠EOA. 

Let me denote ∠EOA = x. Then, the area of the sector is (x/360)*25π. The area of triangle OAB is (1/2)*OA*OB*sin(∠AOB). But ∠AOB is the angle between OA and OB, which is the central angle between points A and B. 

But how to find ∠AOB? Let me think about the total circle. We know ∠BOE = 120°, and if I can express ∠AOB in terms of x and other angles. 

Suppose that ∠AOB + ∠BOE + ∠EOA = 360°, assuming points A, B, E are placed sequentially around the circle. But this assumes that the points are placed in order A-B-E-A around the circle, which might not be the case. 

If that's true, then ∠AOB + 120° + x = 360°, so ∠AOB = 240° - x. 

But without knowing x, this is still one variable. 

However, if I can find another relationship involving x. For example, if there's a triangle involving A and B, or if line AB has a specific property. 

Alternatively, since line AB connects A to B, and line EA connects E to A, maybe triangle EAB has some properties. 

Let me consider triangle EAB. Points E and B are on the circle, and A is also on the circle. So triangle EAB is inscribed in the circle. The angle at A, ∠EAB, would be half the measure of the arc EB that it subtends. Wait, no. The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the central angle. So ∠EAB would be half the measure of the arc EB that does not contain A. 

Since arc EB has measure 120° (from earlier), then ∠EAB = 120° / 2 = 60°. 

Ah! This is a key insight. So in triangle EAB, angle at A is 60°. 

Now, in triangle EAB, we know one angle (∠EAB = 60°), and we know the lengths of BE and EA and AB? Wait, we know BE = 5√3 (from earlier calculation), and EA is a radius, so EA = 5. 

Wait, EA is a radius? Yes, because point A is on the circle with center O, so OA is a radius. But EA is a chord, not necessarily a radius. Wait, E is on the circle, A is on the circle, so EA is a chord of length... which can be calculated if we know the central angle between E and A. 

But let's focus on triangle EAB. We know:

- BE = 5√3 (calculated earlier)
- EA = ?
- AB = ?
- ∠EAB = 60°

But we need more information. However, if I can apply the Law of Sines or Cosines to triangle EAB. 

Let me denote:

In triangle EAB,

∠EAB = 60°

Side opposite ∠EAB is EB = 5√3.

Other sides: EA and AB.

Let me apply the Law of Sines:

sin(∠EAB)/EB = sin(∠EBA)/EA = sin(∠BEA)/AB

But I don't know the other angles. Let me denote ∠EBA as y and ∠BEA as z. Then:

y + z + 60° = 180° => y + z = 120°

Also, from Law of Sines:

sin(60°)/5√3 = sin(y)/EA = sin(z)/AB

But this seems underdetermined. Unless I can find another relation. 

Wait, but EA is a chord of the circle. The length of EA can be calculated if we know the central angle between E and A, which is ∠EOA = x. 

Length of chord EA is 2R sin(x/2) = 2*5*sin(x/2) = 10 sin(x/2). 

Similarly, AB is a chord from A to B, and its length would be 2R sin(∠AOB/2) = 10 sin(∠AOB/2). 

But ∠AOB is related to x and the other angle ∠BOE = 120°, as discussed earlier. 

If I assume that points A, B, E are placed in order around the circle, then ∠AOB + ∠BOE + ∠EOA = 360°, so ∠AOB = 360° - ∠BOE - ∠EOA = 360° - 120° - x = 240° - x. 

So, the length of AB is 10 sin((240° - x)/2) = 10 sin(120° - x/2). 

But this seems complicated. Let me try to combine this with the Law of Sines in triangle EAB. 

From earlier, in triangle EAB, we have:

sin(60°)/5√3 = sin(y)/EA

But EA = 10 sin(x/2), and y is ∠EBA. 

But I also know that ∠EBA is related to the arc EA. Wait, ∠EBA is an inscribed angle subtending arc EA. Wait, no, ∠EBA is at point B, so it subtends arc from E to A that does not contain B. 

Wait, the measure of ∠EBA is half the measure of the arc EA that it subtends. So if the arc EA is x degrees, then ∠EBA = x/2. 

Wait, this is a critical point. Inscribed angle at B subtending arc EA. So ∠EBA = (arc EA)/2 = x/2. 

Yes! So ∠EBA = x/2. 

Similarly, in triangle EAB, we have:

∠EAB = 60°, ∠EBA = x/2, and ∠BEA = 180° - 60° - x/2 = 120° - x/2. 

Now, applying the Law of Sines to triangle EAB:

sin(∠EAB)/EB = sin(∠EBA)/EA

So:

sin(60°)/5√3 = sin(x/2)/EA

But EA is the length of the chord between E and A, which is 2R sin(x/2) = 10 sin(x/2). 

Wait, substituting:

sin(60°)/5√3 = sin(x/2)/(10 sin(x/2)) = 1/10

So:

sin(60°)/5√3 = 1/10

Calculate left-hand side:

sin(60°) = √3/2, so:

(√3/2) / (5√3) = (√3/2) * (1/(5√3)) = 1/(10) 

Which equals 1/10. 

This checks out! So this shows that our assumption is consistent, but it doesn't give us new information. It confirms the consistency but doesn't allow us to solve for x. 

Hmm. This means that x can be any value, as long as the above holds, but it doesn't provide a unique value for x. So this approach doesn't help us determine x. 

I need another way to find x. Let me think. 

Since we know BE = 5√3, and EA = 10 sin(x/2), and AB is another side of the triangle. Let me try using the Law of Cosines on triangle EAB. 

Law of Cosines: 

AB² = EA² + BE² - 2*EA*BE*cos(∠EBA)

Wait, ∠EBA is x/2, and EA = 10 sin(x/2), BE = 5√3. 

So:

AB² = (10 sin(x/2))² + (5√3)^2 - 2*(10 sin(x/2))*(5√3)*cos(x/2)

Simplify:

AB² = 100 sin²(x/2) + 75 - 100√3 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)

But AB is also a chord from A to B, so AB = 10 sin(∠AOB/2) = 10 sin((240° - x)/2) = 10 sin(120° - x/2). 

Therefore, AB² = 100 sin²(120° - x/2)

So:

100 sin²(120° - x/2) = 100 sin²(x/2) + 75 - 100√3 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)

Divide both sides by 100:

sin²(120° - x/2) = sin²(x/2) + 75/100 - √3 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)

Simplify:

sin²(120° - x/2) = sin²(x/2) + 3/4 - √3 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)

This equation looks complex, but maybe we can simplify it using trigonometric identities. Let me expand sin(120° - x/2):

Using the identity sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB.

Let me denote θ = x/2, so the equation becomes:

sin²(120° - θ) = sin²θ + 3/4 - √3 sinθ cosθ

Expand sin²(120° - θ):

First, compute sin(120° - θ) = sin120° cosθ - cos120° sinθ

Sin120° = √3/2, cos120° = -1/2.

So:

sin(120° - θ) = (√3/2)cosθ - (-1/2)sinθ = (√3/2)cosθ + (1/2)sinθ

Then, squaring this:

[ (√3/2)cosθ + (1/2)sinθ ]^2 = (3/
