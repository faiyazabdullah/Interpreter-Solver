Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram JKLM, and we need to find the measure of angle KJL. Let me first recall the properties of a parallelogram. 

First, the given predicates mention that it's a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal and opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, the problem also gives some specific lengths and angles. Let me jot down all the given info.

Given:
- Parallelogram J, K, L, M. So, sides JK, KL, LM, MJ. Opposite sides are equal. So JK equals LM, and KL equals MJ. Also, opposite angles are equal. Adjacent angles are supplementary.

But wait, looking at the length equations:
- Length of JK is 2b + 3. But since it's a parallelogram, LM should equal JK. Then, Length of LM is given as 45? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:

Wait, the user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)), 2b + 3)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), 21)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,M)), 45)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,J)), 3a)"

So, Line JK has length 2b+3, KL is 21, LM is 45, and MJ is 3a. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, JK equals LM, so 2b + 3 = 45. And KL equals MJ, so 21 = 3a. That seems like something to solve for variables. Wait, but maybe those are just given as part of the problem?

Also, there are angle measures given. For example, Measure of Angle KLM is 70 degrees, Measure of Angle KML is 30 degrees, and Measure of Angle LKM is 80 degrees. Wait, let me check again:

Original problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)), 70) → This is angle at point L, between points K, L, M. So ∠KLM = 70°.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)), 30) → This would be angle at point M, between K, M, L. So ∠KML = 30°.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,M)), 80) → This is angle at point K, between L, K, M. So ∠LKM = 80°.

Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 70°, the adjacent angle should be 110°, but here they have other angles mentioned. Hmm, perhaps I need to draw the parallelogram to visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: Parallelogram JKLM. Let me label the vertices in order: J connected to K, K to L, L to M, M back to J. So sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Now, the angles mentioned:

Angle KLM is at point L, between K-L-M. In a parallelogram, angle at L and angle at K are supplementary. Similarly, angle at M and angle at J are supplementary. Wait, but given that ∠KLM is 70°, then angle at K (which would be adjacent to angle at L) should be 180° - 70° = 110°. However, another angle given is ∠KML = 30°, which is angle at M between K-M-L. Wait, in a parallelogram, angle at M and angle at L are equal? No, because opposite angles are equal. Wait, if angle at L is 70°, then angle at M should also be 70°, but ∠KML is 30°, which is different. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the standard ones. Let me clarify each angle:

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) → vertex at L, with segments KL and LM. So that's angle at L between K and M. Which is ∠KLM = 70°.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)) → vertex at M, with segments KM and ML. Wait, K-M-L? So that's angle at M between K and L. So that's ∠KML = 30°.

MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,M)) → vertex at K, with segments LK and KM. So that's angle at K between L and M. So that's ∠LKM = 80°.

Hmm. So in triangle KLM, we have angles at L (70°), at M (30°), and at K (80°). Wait, adding up these three angles: 70 + 30 + 80 = 180°, which makes sense. So triangle KLM is formed by points K, L, M. But in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Wait, but how does this relate to the parallelogram?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle KLM within the parallelogram. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, but here we have angles inside triangle KLM. Let me think.

Since JKLM is a parallelogram, then KL is parallel to JM, and JK is parallel to LM. Also, the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. But perhaps focusing on the angles given in the problem.

We need to find m∠KJL. So angle at point J between points K and L. So that's angle KJL, which is the angle at vertex J between points K and L. In the parallelogram, the angle at J is adjacent to angle at K. Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle at J is x, then angle at K is 180° - x. But we need to find angle KJL, which is the same as angle at J in the parallelogram.

Wait, but how do the given angles fit into this? Let's try to analyze triangle KLM again. In triangle KLM, angles are 70°, 30°, 80°, which add up to 180°, so that's consistent. So maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle KLM to find side ratios?

But in the parallelogram, sides KL = 21, LM = 45. Wait, KL is 21, LM is 45. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So KL equals MJ, and LM equals JK. Wait, given that:

From the problem:

Length of KL (Line K,L) is 21. So KL = 21. Then, since it's a parallelogram, MJ (Line M,J) should be equal to KL. But the length of MJ is given as 3a. Therefore, 3a = 21 ⇒ a = 7. So that gives us a value for a.

Similarly, LM (Line L,M) is 45. Since LM is opposite to JK (Line J,K), so JK should also be 45. But the length of JK is given as 2b + 3. So 2b + 3 = 45 ⇒ 2b = 42 ⇒ b = 21. So that gives us values for a and b.

Now, knowing that, perhaps we can use the angles in triangle KLM to find relations. Let me consider triangle KLM. We know the lengths of KL = 21, LM = 45, and we can find KM using the Law of Cosines if we know an angle. Wait, in triangle KLM, we have angles at K, L, M as 80°, 70°, 30° respectively. Wait, earlier I thought angle at K was 80°, which is ∠LKM. So in triangle KLM:

KL = 21, LM = 45, angle at L is 70°, angle at M is 30°, angle at K is 80°. So applying the Law of Sines:

In triangle KLM,

KL / sin(angle at M) = LM / sin(angle at K) = KM / sin(angle at L)

So KL / sin(30°) = LM / sin(80°)

Plugging numbers:

21 / (1/2) = 45 / sin(80°)

Left side: 21 / 0.5 = 42

Right side: 45 / sin(80°). Let me compute sin(80°). Approximately, sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848.

So 45 / 0.9848 ≈ 45.71. But left side is 42, which doesn't match. That suggests inconsistency. Wait, but maybe my assumption about the angles is wrong?

Wait, hold on. The angles given in the problem may not correspond directly to triangle KLM. Let me re-examine the angle labels.

Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L, between K-L-M. So that's ∠KLM = 70°, as before.

Angle(K,M,L) is angle at M between K-M-L. So that's ∠KML = 30°, as before.

Angle(L,K,M) is angle at K between L-K-M. So that's ∠LKM = 80°, as before.

Therefore, in triangle KLM, angles are indeed 70°, 30°, and 80°, adding up to 180°. But according to Law of Sines, the ratio KL/sin(angle at M) should equal LM/sin(angle at K). Let me calculate:

KL = 21, angle at M = 30°, so 21 / sin(30°) = 21 / 0.5 = 42.

LM = 45, angle at K = 80°, so 45 / sin(80°) ≈ 45 / 0.9848 ≈ 45.71. These aren't equal, which suggests either an error in my understanding or calculation.

Hmm. This discrepancy implies that either my identification of the angles is incorrect, or perhaps the given lengths don't align with the given angles. But the problem statement includes all these predicates, so they must be consistent. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angles.

Wait, maybe the angles given are not internal angles of triangle KLM. Let me think again. The parallelogram is J, K, L, M. So connecting points J, K, L, M in order. Diagonals are JL and KM. So point R is mentioned in several lines: Line(J,R), Line(K,R), Line(L,R), Line(M,R). Wait, the problem mentions Point(R), and Lines from J, K, L, M to R. But maybe R is the intersection of the diagonals? Because in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So if R is the intersection point of diagonals, then JR and KR would be parts of the diagonals. However, the problem gives several lines from J, K, L, M to R, but maybe R is arbitrary? Or perhaps R is a typo or mislabel? Alternatively, maybe R is a point where certain lines intersect, but without more info, it's unclear. However, the presence of R might not be directly relevant unless it's part of a triangle or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are not in triangle KLM but elsewhere. Let me check again the angle definitions.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)): this is angle at L, between K-L-M. So yes, that's ∠KLM.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,L)): angle at M between K-M-L, which is ∠KML.

MeasureOf(Angle(L,K,M)): angle at K between L-K-M, which is ∠LKM.

So in triangle KLM, angles are ∠KLM=70°, ∠KML=30°, ∠LKM=80°, which adds up correctly. So why the Law of Sines gives inconsistent results?

Wait, maybe the sides KL, LM, and KM are not the sides of the triangle? Wait, KL is one side, LM is another, but KM is the diagonal. Wait, in triangle KLM, the sides are KL, LM, and KM. So KM is the diagonal of the parallelogram. Therefore, if we can find KM, then we could verify the Law of Sines.

But how to find KM? Well, in the parallelogram, the diagonals can be found using the formula involving the sides and angles. Alternatively, using vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, since we know the sides of the parallelogram, and the angles between them. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy the relation:

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. But we don't know the angles between the sides, though. Wait, but we have angles inside triangle KLM. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on triangle KLM. Let me attempt that.

In triangle KLM, sides KL=21, LM=45, angle at L is 70°, so we can find KM using Law of Cosines:

KM² = KL² + LM² - 2*KL*LM*cos(angle at L)

So KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(70°)

Calculating:

21² = 441, 45² = 2025, so total is 441 + 2025 = 2466.

Then subtract 2*21*45*cos(70°).

Calculate cos(70°): approximately 0.3420.

So 2*21*45 = 1890.

Multiply by cos(70°): 1890 * 0.3420 ≈ 1890 * 0.342 ≈ let's compute:

1890 * 0.3 = 567

1890 * 0.042 = approx 1890 * 0.04 = 75.6; 1890 * 0.002 = 3.78 → total ~79.38

Total subtraction: 567 + 79.38 ≈ 646.38

Thus KM² ≈ 2466 - 646.38 ≈ 1819.62 → KM ≈ sqrt(1819.62) ≈ 42.66 units.

Now, according to Law of Sines, in triangle KLM:

KL / sin(angle at M) = LM / sin(angle at K) = KM / sin(angle at L)

So KL / sin(30°) = 21 / 0.5 = 42

LM / sin(80°) = 45 / sin(80°) ≈ 45 / 0.9848 ≈ 45.71

KM / sin(70°) ≈ 42.66 / 0.9397 ≈ 45.43

These are close but not exactly equal due to rounding errors. The slight discrepancies are likely due to approximation in cosine and sine values. So assuming that the given angles and sides are consistent, even if the Law of Sines isn't perfectly matching due to calculator precision, we can proceed.

Now, returning to the main goal: finding angle KJL, which is the angle at vertex J between points K and L. In the parallelogram, angle at J is adjacent to angle at K. Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if we can find the measure of angle at J, that would be our answer.

But how to find angle at J? Let's consider that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M.

But we have angle at L (∠KLM) as 70°, which is one of the angles of the parallelogram? Wait, no. Wait, ∠KLM is an angle in triangle KLM, but in the parallelogram, angle at L is the angle between sides KL and LM. Which would be the same as ∠KLM in the parallelogram. Wait, yes! Because in the parallelogram, at point L, the angle between KL and LM is the interior angle of the parallelogram at L. Therefore, angle at L in the parallelogram is 70°, making angle at J equal to 70°, since opposite angles are equal. Wait, but that would make angle KJL (at J) equal to 70°, which would be answer B. But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M. Given that angle at L is 70°, then angle at J is also 70°, so ∠KJL is 70°, which would be answer B. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing angles here.

Wait, the angle at point J in the parallelogram is between sides JK and JM. But the question asks for angle KJL, which is at point J between points K and L. Wait, in the parallelogram, point J is connected to K and M. So angle KJL would be the angle at J between K and L. But point L is not directly connected to J. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The parallelogram is J-K-L-M-J. So edges are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So at point J, the edges are JK and MJ. So angle at J is between JK and MJ. But the question is asking for angle KJL, which is the angle at point J between points K and L. Wait, but point L is not directly connected to J. Unless we're talking about the angle formed by extending lines or something else.

Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify the notation. In angle KJL, the vertex is J, with segments JK and JL. So it's the angle at J between points K and L. Wait, but JL is a diagonal of the parallelogram, connecting J to L. So angle KJL is the angle at J between K and L, which involves the diagonal JL.

Ah, so this is not the interior angle of the parallelogram at J, but rather an angle formed by the diagonal JL. So this requires a different approach.

So, in the parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So, the diagonals are JL and KM, intersecting at point R (assuming R is the intersection point). But the problem mentions point R and lines from J, K, L, M to R. However, without knowing where R is, but given that all four lines are present, it's likely that R is the intersection of the diagonals.

Assuming that, then in the parallelogram, diagonals divide each other into halves. So, for instance, JR = RL, and KR = RM. But how does this help us with angle KJL?

Alternatively, since we need to find angle KJL, which is the angle between JK and JL at point J. To find this angle, we might need to use the properties of the parallelogram and possibly trigonometry.

Let me consider triangle JKL. Wait, but in the parallelogram, points J, K, L are connected as follows: JK is a side, KL is a side, and JL is a diagonal. So triangle JKL has sides JK, KL, and JL. We know JK = 2b + 3 = 45 (from earlier calculation, since LM = 45 and opposite sides are equal), KL = 21. We can find JL using the Law of Cosines if we know an angle. But what angle?

Alternatively, since we know the angles in triangle KLM, and perhaps relating that to the rest.

Wait, earlier we considered triangle KLM with angles 70°, 30°, 80°, and sides KL=21, LM=45, KM≈42.66. Also, in the parallelogram, the diagonals split it into triangles. So diagonal JL divides the parallelogram into two triangles, JKL and JML. 

Alternatively, since we know the sides of the parallelogram, and the angles between the sides, we can find the diagonals using the formula for the diagonals in terms of the sides and angles.

In a parallelogram, the length of the diagonals can be found using the formula:

d1² = a² + b² + 2ab cosθ

d2² = a² + b² - 2ab cosθ

where θ is one of the angles of the parallelogram. Wait, but which angle? Depending on which diagonal we're considering.

Wait, actually, the formula depends on the angle between the sides. Suppose the sides are of lengths a and b, and the angle between them is θ. Then the diagonals are:

d1² = a² + b² + 2ab cosθ

d2² = a² + b² - 2ab cosθ

So, for example, if we take the angle at J as θ, then the diagonals would be calculated accordingly.

But we need to find angle KJL, which is the angle between JK and JL at point J. So in triangle JKL, we have sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL (the diagonal). If we can find JL, we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle at J.

But to find JL, we need to know the angle between sides JK and KL, which is the angle at K of the parallelogram. Wait, but we have some angles given. Earlier, we had angle at K in triangle KLM as 80°, which is ∠LKM. Is that the same as the angle at K in the parallelogram?

Wait, in the parallelogram, the angle at K is between sides JK and KL. In triangle KLM, ∠LKM is the angle at K between L and M. But since in the parallelogram, point M is connected to K via side KM. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the angle at K is between sides JK and KL. Whereas ∠LKM is the angle between LK and KM, which is different. So that angle (80°) is not the same as the interior angle at K of the parallelogram. Hence, we cannot directly use that to find the angle at K of the parallelogram.

This complicates things. So perhaps we need to find the angle at K of the parallelogram, then use that to find the diagonals.

Alternatively, since we know the sides of the parallelogram, and some angles from triangle KLM, maybe we can find the angle at K of the parallelogram.

Wait, in the parallelogram, the sum of the angles around a point is 360°, and opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. But we have some angles from triangle KLM. Let me try to relate them.

Earlier, we had in triangle KLM:

∠KLM = 70° (at L), ∠KML = 30° (at M), ∠LKM = 80° (at K). 

But in the parallelogram, the angle at L is 70°, as discussed. Since in the parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, the angle at M would be supplementary to angle at L. So angle at M would be 180° - 70° = 110°. But according to triangle KLM, ∠KML is 30°, which is part of the angle at M in the parallelogram. How does that fit?

Wait, the angle at M in the parallelogram is composed of two angles: ∠KML (given as 30°) and another angle? Or is ∠KML part of the angle at M in the parallelogram? Let me think about the structure.

At point M in the parallelogram, the sides are LM and MJ. The angle at M of the parallelogram is between LM and MJ. But in triangle KLM, the angle at M is ∠KML, which is between KM and ML. So ∠KML is part of the angle at M of the parallelogram. So the entire angle at M of the parallelogram is equal to ∠KML plus another angle? Or is it the same as ∠KML?

Wait, if we draw diagonal KM, it splits the parallelogram into two triangles: KLM and KJM. In triangle KLM, ∠KML is 30°, which is part of the angle at M of the parallelogram. The remaining part of the angle at M would be the angle between KM and MJ. But since the diagonals bisect each other, maybe that angle is related to other parts?

Alternatively, since the sum of the angles in the parallelogram at point M is equal to the angle of the parallelogram at M. But earlier, we said that angle at L is 70°, so angle at M should be 110°, as adjacent angles are supplementary. But according to triangle KLM, ∠KML is 30°, which is part of the angle at M of the parallelogram. So the remaining part of the angle at M is 110° - 30° = 80°, which would be the angle between KM and MJ. 

But how does this help us? Perhaps we can use this to find other angles.

Alternatively, since we know the sides of the parallelogram and some angles, maybe we can use the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle KLM to find the length of KM, then use that to find the diagonals of the parallelogram.

Earlier, we estimated KM ≈ 42.66. But let's calculate it precisely.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle KLM:

KM² = KL² + LM² - 2*KL*LM*cos(angle at L)

Which is:

KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(70°)

Compute each term:

21² = 441

45² = 2025

Sum: 441 + 2025 = 2466

Now, 2*21*45 = 1890

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420201433

So 1890 * 0's value: 1890 * 0.3420201433 ≈ Let's compute this accurately.

First, 1890 * 0.3 = 567

1890 * 0.0420201433 ≈ ?

Well, 0.0420201433 is approximately 0.042.

So 1890 * 0.042 = 1890 * 0.04 + 1890 * 0.002 = 75.6 + 3.78 = 79.38

So total subtraction: 567 + 79.38 = 646.38

So KM² ≈ 2466 - 646.38 = 1819.62

Thus, KM ≈ √1819.62 ≈ 42.66

Now, in the parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM. We've computed KM ≈ 42.66. Now, we can find JL using the formula for diagonals in a parallelogram.

But to use that formula, we need the lengths of the sides and the angle between them. Wait, we know the sides of the parallelogram: JK = 45, KL = 21. But we need the angle between them. Let's denote the angle at J as θ, which is the angle between sides JK and JM. Wait, but how to find θ?

Alternatively, since we know the diagonals, we can use the relationship between diagonals and sides in a parallelogram. The formula is:

For a parallelogram with sides a and b, and diagonals d1 and d2:

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²)

Here, we know one diagonal KM ≈ 42.66, and we need to find the other diagonal JL.

But we don't know the other diagonal yet. However, we can relate it to the sides and the angle between them.

Alternatively, using vector methods. Let me assume vectors for the sides.

Let’s place point J at the origin (0,0). Assume side JK is along the x-axis, so point K is at (45, 0) since JK = 45. Now, we need to find coordinates of point L such that KL = 21, and the angle at J is θ, which we need to find.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, since we know the other diagonal KM, which connects K to M. But point M is such that MJ = 3a = 21 (since earlier we found a = 7). So MJ = 21.

Wait, earlier we determined that MJ = 3a = 21 ⇒ a = 7. Also, from earlier, JK = 2b + 3 = 45 ⇒ b = 21.

So the sides are JK = 45, KL = 21, LM = 45, MJ = 21. So the sides are 45 and 21. Now, the diagonals are KM and JL.

We already calculated KM ≈ 42.66. Using the formula for diagonals:

d1² + d2² = 2*(a² + b²) = 2*(45² + 21²) = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*2466 = 4932.

So if KM ≈ 42.66, then KM² ≈ 1819.62, so JL² = 4932 - 1819.62 ≈ 3112.38, so JL ≈ √3112.38 ≈ 55.78.

Now, in triangle JKL, we have sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL ≈ 55.78. We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle at J, which is ∠KJL.

Law of Cosines:

cos(angle at J) = (JK² + JL² - KL²) / (2 * JK * JL)

Wait, no. Wait, angle at J is between sides JK and JL. So in triangle JKL, the sides are:

- JK = 45

- JL = 55.78

- KL = 21

So, applying Law of Cosines:

KL² = JK² + JL² - 2*JK*JL*cos(angle at J)

Rearranged:

cos(angle at J) = (JK² + JL² - KL²) / (2*JK*JL)

Plug in the values:

JK² = 45² = 2025

JL² ≈ (55.78)^2 ≈ 3112.38

KL² = 21² = 441

So numerator: 2025 + 3112.38 - 441 = (2025 - 441) + 3112.38 = 1584 + 3112.38 = 4696.38

Denominator: 2 * 45 * 55.78 ≈ 90 * 55.78 ≈ 5020.2

So cos(angle at J) ≈ 4696.38 / 5020.2 ≈ 0.935

Thus, angle at J ≈ arccos(0.935) ≈ 20.6 degrees. Wait, that's way smaller than expected. But this contradicts previous assumptions. What went wrong?

Wait, this suggests that angle KJL is approximately 20.6°, which is not among the options. But the answer choices are A. 30, B. 70, C. 80, D. 100. So something's wrong here. Probably an error in the assumption about the diagonal lengths.

Wait, let me double-check the diagonal formula. The formula d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²) applies to a parallelogram. Here, a and b are the lengths of the sides. So in this case, a = 45, b = 21. Thus, d1² + d2² = 2*(45² + 21²) = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*2466 = 4932.

But earlier, I calculated KM² ≈ 1819.62, so JL² = 4932 - 1819.62 = 3112.38. But this assumes that KM is one diagonal and JL is the other. However, in reality, the diagonals are JL and KM. But I calculated KM using triangle KLM, which may not be accurate because the angle used was from the triangle, not the parallelogram.

Wait, this suggests that the initial assumption that angle at L in the parallelogram is 70° is incorrect. Because in triangle KLM, we used angle at L as 70°, but in the parallelogram, the angle at L is actually the angle between KL and LM, which is the same as the angle in triangle KLM. So this should be valid. But then why is the resulting angle at J giving us something not in the answer choices?

Maybe my calculation of KM is wrong. Let me re-calculate KM using precise values.

Let me redo the Law of Cosines calculation for KM:

KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(70°)

Let me calculate cos(70°) more precisely. Using calculator input, cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420201433.

So:

2*21*45 = 1890

1890 * cos(70°) ≈ 1890 * 0.3420201433 ≈ let's calculate this precisely:

First, 1890 × 0.3420201433

Breakdown:

0.3 × 1890 = 567

0.04 × 1890 = 75.6

0.0020201433 × 1890 ≈ 1890 × 0.002 = 3.78, plus 1890 × 0.0000201433 ≈ 0.038. Total ≈ 3.78 + 0.038 = 3.818

Adding up: 567 + 75.6 = 642.6 + 3.818 ≈ 646.418

So KM² = 2466 - 646.418 = 1819.582

So KM ≈ sqrt(1819.582) ≈ 42.655

So JL² = 4932 - 1819.582 = 3112.418 → JL ≈ sqrt(3112.418) ≈ 55.79

Now, applying Law of Cosines in triangle JKL:

KL² = 21² = 441

JK² = 45² = 2025

JL² ≈ 3112.418

So angle at J (which is ∠KJL):

cos(theta) = (JK² + JL² - KL²)/(2*JK*JL)

= (2025 + 3112.418 - 441) / (2*45*55.79)

Calculate numerator: 2025 + 3112.418 = 5137.418 - 441 = 4696.418

Denominator: 2*45*55.79 = 90 * 55.79 ≈ 5021.1

So cos(theta) ≈ 4696.418 / 5021.1 ≈ 0.935

Which gives theta ≈ arccos(0.935) ≈ 20.6 degrees. Still getting the same result. This doesn't match any of the answer choices. Clearly, there's a flaw in this approach.

Let me reconsider the problem from scratch.

We need to find angle KJL, which is at point J between points K and L. In the parallelogram, this is the angle between sides JK and JL. But JL is a diagonal.

Another approach: in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So if we can find the coordinates of the points, we could calculate the angle.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's set point J at (0,0). Let's assume side JK is along the x-axis, so point K is at (45, 0), since JK = 45. Now, we need to determine coordinates of point L such that KL = 21 and LM = 45, and MJ = 21.

But since it's a parallelogram, vector JL should be equal to vector KM. Wait, no, in a parallelogram, vector JK equals vector LM, and vector KL equals vector JM.

Alternatively, since it's a parallelogram, the coordinates can be defined as follows:

Let J be at (0,0), K at (45,0). Let point M be at (x,y), and point L be at (45+x, y), since in a parallelogram, vector JM equals vector KL. Wait, this might get too involved, but let's try.

Vector JM = vector KL. Vector KL is from K to L: L - K = (x_L - 45, y_L - 0). Vector JM is from J to M: (x_M - 0, y_M - 0) = (x_M, y_M). So setting these equal: x_M = x_L - 45, y_M = y_L.

Also, since LM = 45, the distance from L to M is 45. Coordinates of L: (x_L, y_L); M: (x_L - 45, y_L). Distance LM is sqrt[(x_L - (x_L - 45))² + (y_L - y_L)²] = sqrt[45² + 0] = 45. Correct.

Now, MJ = 21. Distance from M to J is sqrt[x_M² + y_M²] = sqrt[(x_L - 45)^2 + y_L^2] = 21.

Also, KL = 21. Distance from K to L: sqrt[(x_L - 45)^2 + y_L^2] = 21. Wait, but this is the same as MJ = 21. So this gives us that KL = MJ = 21, which matches the given data.

So now, we need to find coordinates of L such that KL = 21, and LM = 45. Wait, but LM is already satisfied by construction. Wait, but also, we need to ensure that the angle at L is 70°, as per the given data. But how to incorporate that?

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates, we can use the given angle at L (70°) to find the coordinates.

At point L, the angle between KL and LM is 70°. Let's compute this angle using vectors.

Vector LK = K - L = (45 - x_L, 0 - y_L)

Vector LM = M - L = ((x_L - 45) - x_L, y_L - y_L) = (-45, 0)

So angle between vectors LK and LM is 70°. 

Let's compute the dot product of vectors LK and LM.

LK · LM = (45 - x_L)(-45) + (0 - y_L)(0) = -45*(45 - x_L) + 0 = -2025 + 45x_L

The magnitude of LK is sqrt[(45 - x_L)^2 + y_L^2] = 21 (since KL = 21).

The magnitude of LM is sqrt[(-45)^2 + 0^2] = 45.

So the cosine of the angle between LK and LM is:

cos(theta) = (LK · LM) / (|LK| |LM|) = [-2025 + 45x_L] / (21 * 45)

We know theta is 70°, so:

[-2025 + 45x_L] / (945) = cos(70°)

Multiply both sides by 945:

-2025 + 45x_L = 945 * cos(70°)

Compute 945 * cos(70°):

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420201433

So 945 * 0.3420201433 ≈ 945 * 0.342 ≈ let's calculate:

945 * 0.3 = 283.5

945 * 0.042 = 945 * 0.04 + 945 * 0.002 = 37.8 + 1.89 = 39.69

Total ≈ 283.5 + 39.69 = 323.19

So:

-2025 + 45x_L ≈ 323.19

→ 45x_L ≈ 2025 + 323.19 = 2348.19

→ x_L ≈ 2348.19 / 45 ≈ 52.182

So x_L ≈ 52.182

Now, we can find y_L from the fact that KL = 21. 

The distance from K to L is 21:

sqrt[(x_L - 45)^2 + y_L^2] = 21

Square both sides:

(x_L - 45)^2 + y_L^2 = 441

Substitute x_L ≈ 52.182:

(52.182 - 45)^2 + y_L^2 = 441

(7.182)^2 + y_L^2 = 441

Calculate 7.182 squared: approximately 7.182^2 = 51.58

So y_L^2 = 441 - 51.58 = 389.42 → y_L ≈ ±√389.42 ≈ ±19.73

So coordinates of L are approximately (52.182, 19.73) or (52.182, -19.73). Assuming the parallelogram is oriented in a standard position, let's take positive y-coordinate: L ≈ (52.182, 19.73)

Now, point M is at (x_L - 45, y_L) = (52.182 - 45, 19.73) = (7.182, 19.73)

Now, we need to find angle KJL, which is the angle at J (0,0) between points K (45,0) and L (52.182, 19.73).
