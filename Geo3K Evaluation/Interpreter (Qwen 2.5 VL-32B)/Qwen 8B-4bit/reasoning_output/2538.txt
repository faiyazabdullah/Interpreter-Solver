MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the structure of the figure. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned.

Points involved are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Lines are DE, EH, BF, FG, BG. Triangles are BFG, DEG, ABC. Also, there are several angles given with their measures: Angle at B-D-C is 50 degrees, angle at C-B-G is 78 degrees, angle at B-G-F is 120 degrees, and angle at E-G-A is 56 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle 3, which I assume refers to one of these angles, but since it's labeled as ∠3, maybe it's another angle formed by intersecting lines?

Wait, the problem mentions "the figure," so I should try to visualize or sketch the diagram based on the given information. Let me note down each part:

First, Triangle(B, F, G): So points B, F, G form a triangle. Then Triangle(D, E, G): Points D, E, G form another triangle. Triangle(A, B, C): Points A, B, C form a triangle. All points are individual points except for lines connecting them. 

Lines: Line(D,E), Line(E,H), Line(B,F), Line(F,G), Line(B,G). So DE is a line, extending to H via E-H. Then BF connects B to F, FG connects F to G, and BG connects B to G. So point G is connected to both F and B. Also, line BG is present. 

Angles given: 
- Measure of angle BDC (which would be angle at D between B and C? Wait, the angle is written as Angle(B, D, C) — in standard notation, that's angle at D between points B and C. Wait, but point C isn't directly connected to D unless through other lines. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if there are more connections. 

Also, the angles listed:
- Angle(B, D, C) = 50°
- Angle(C, B, G) = 78°
- Angle(B, G, F) = 120°
- Angle(E, G, A) = 56°

So angle at D between B and C is 50°, angle at B between C and G is 78°, angle at G between B and F is 120°, and angle at G between E and A is 56°. 

Now, the question is about finding measure of angle 3. Since the options are A to D, and the given angles are 50, 78, 120, 56, perhaps angle 3 refers to another angle formed in the figure. But without seeing the actual figure, I have to deduce based on the given info.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure mentally. Let's consider each triangle and lines:

Starting with Triangle(B, F, G). So points B, F, G form a triangle. There's also a line from B to G, so BG is a side of this triangle. Additionally, there's a line from F to G, making FG another side. Then line BF connects B to F. So triangle BFG has sides BF, FG, GB. Given that angle at G (between B and F) is 120°, as per Angle(B, G, F) = 120°. 

Then there's Triangle(D, E, G). Points D, E, G form a triangle. Line DE is given, and line EH extends from E. So point H is connected to E, forming line EH. Also, there's line EG (since Triangle D-E-G implies edges DE, EG, GD). Wait, but the line EG isn't explicitly mentioned, but since Triangle(D,E,G) exists, that suggests that points D, E, G are connected such that DE, EG, and GD are the sides. However, the given lines are DE, EH, BF, FG, BG. So EG is part of Triangle D-E-G, hence EG is a line segment. Therefore, point G is connected to E. Also, there's a line from E to H. 

Additionally, Triangle(A,B,C): points A, B, C form a triangle. So AB, BC, CA are sides. Now, looking at the angles:

Angle(B, D, C) = 50°. This is angle at D between points B and C. Wait, how does point D connect to B and C? Because D is part of Triangle D-E-G, so D is connected to E and G. But where is point C? It's part of Triangle A-B-C. So point C is connected to B and A. So angle at D between B and C... That suggests that BD and DC are two sides meeting at D, but how is point C connected to D? Unless there's a line connecting D to C. Alternatively, maybe there's an intersection somewhere? Or perhaps some lines cross?

Alternatively, maybe there's a line from C to D? Not sure yet. Let me think again. The angle at D between B and C would require that points B, D, C are arranged such that D is the vertex. So BD and DC are the two sides. Therefore, point D is connected to B and C. But according to the given lines, D is connected to E and G (from line DE and triangle D-E-G). So unless there's a connection from D to C, which isn't stated. Wait, but maybe there's an implicit connection because of the triangle involving point C. For example, if C is connected to D? Or maybe there's a line from C to D?

Alternatively, maybe angle BDC is referring to angle at D formed by lines DB and DC. But since D is connected to E and G, but not necessarily to B or C. So unless there's a line from D to B or D to C. But according to the given lines, we don't have lines connecting D to B or C. So maybe there's something missing here. Perhaps there's an intersection of lines?

Wait, let's look at other angles. Angle(C, B, G) = 78°, which is angle at B between C and G. So point B is connected to C and G. From earlier, we know that line BG exists (as per Line(B, G)), and line BC is part of Triangle A-B-C. So yes, point B is connected to C (side BC of triangle ABC) and to G (line BG). Thus, angle at B between C and G is 78°, which is given. 

Similarly, angle at G between B and F is 120°, which is angle BGF. And angle at G between E and A is 56°, which is angle EGA. 

Now, considering all these, perhaps there are multiple triangles and overlapping lines. Let me try to map out all the lines and connections:

Points:

- A, B, C: Triangle ABC.
- B, F, G: Triangle BFG.
- D, E, G: Triangle DEG.
- Lines: DE, EH, BF, FG, BG.

So:

- Point D is connected to E (DE) and to G (from triangle D-E-G).
- Point E is connected to D (DE) and to H (EH).
- Point G is connected to F (FG), to B (BG), and to D (from triangle D-E-G).
- Point B is connected to F (BF), to G (BG), and to C (BC).
- Point C is connected to B (BC) and to A (CA).
- Point A is connected to C (CA) and to G? Wait, angle EGA is mentioned, which is angle at G between E and A. So point A is connected to G? Because angle at G involves E and A, implying GA is a line segment. So GA is a line from G to A. Therefore, point A is connected to G. So line GA exists. 

Therefore, adding that, point A is connected to G. So line GA connects G to A. 

So now, lines include GA (from angle EGA). Also, line EH connects E to H. 

Now, back to angle BDC (at D between B and C). How is D connected to B and C? Since D is connected to E and G, but not directly to B or C. Unless there's an intersection of lines. For instance, maybe line DC intersects with some other line at D? Or perhaps there's a line from D to C? 

But given that point C is part of triangle ABC, and point D is part of triangle DEG. Without explicit lines, perhaps there's an intersection of lines like BG and DC? Or some other lines?

Alternatively, maybe angle BDC is formed by lines DB and DC, but those lines aren't explicitly given. Therefore, perhaps there's a missing line or a concurrency point?

This seems complicated. Let me try to find relations between the given angles and see if I can use triangle angle sums or other theorems.

First, looking at triangle BFG: points B, F, G. We know angle at G is 120°, so angles at B and F can be found if needed. Let's denote:

In triangle BFG, sum of angles is 180°. So angle at B + angle at F + 120° = 180° → angles at B and F sum to 60°. But we don't know either individually yet.

Looking at triangle DEG: points D, E, G. We know angle at G is part of angle EGA (which is 56°). Wait, angle EGA is at G between E and A. So if GA is connected to G, then angle at G between E and A is 56°. So in triangle DEG, angle at G could involve E and D? Or maybe not. Because triangle DEG has vertices D, E, G. So its internal angles are at D, E, G. So angle at G in triangle DEG would be between D and E. But the given angle at G is between E and A (angle EGA), which is different. So maybe that angle is outside the triangle DEG?

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to focus on the angles given and see if I can find relationships.

We have:

- At point B: angle between C and G is 78°, and angle between D and C is 50°? Wait, angle BDC is at D, not B. Wait, angle BDC is at D. So that's angle between BD and CD. But how do we get BD and CD?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving D, B, and C? But unless there's a line connecting D to B or D to C, we can't assume that. However, since angle BDC is given, that suggests that lines BD and CD exist. So BD and CD are two sides meeting at D, forming angle 50°. Therefore, point D must be connected to B and C. But according to previous information, D is connected to E and G. So unless BD and CD are extensions of existing lines? Or maybe BD is part of another line?

Wait, perhaps line BG passes through D? No, because BG is connected to B and G. Or maybe line BD is part of another line. Alternatively, maybe there's a line from D to B and D to C, which are not explicitly mentioned but implied by the angle.

Assuming that BD and CD are present, even though they're not in the given lines. But since the problem gives us that angle BDC exists, we have to accept that. So, assuming that BD and CD are present, even if they are not explicitly named as lines.

Given that, let's proceed. So angle at D (BDC) is 50°, angle at B (CBG) is 78°, angle at G (BGF) is 120°, angle at G (EGA) is 56°.

Now, looking for relationships between these angles. Let me consider triangle BGC. Wait, point G is connected to B and C? Wait, point C is connected to B (from triangle ABC), and point G is connected to B (line BG). So if there's a line from G to C, then triangle BGC would have angles at B, G, and C. But is there a line from G to C? Not sure. However, angle CBG is 78°, which is at B between C and G. So that's part of triangle BGC if GC exists.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate angles around point G. At point G, we have angles:

- Between B and F: 120° (given)
- Between E and A: 56° (given)
- Possibly others if there are more lines connected to G.

Since point G is connected to F (FG), B (BG), D (from triangle D-E-G?), and A (GA). So lines from G are GF, GB, GA, and possibly GD (if triangle D-E-G includes GD). So in triangle D-E-G, GD is a side. Hence, line GD connects G to D. Therefore, at point G, there are four lines: GF, GB, GA, and GD. So the angles around point G would be:

Between GF and GD,
GD and GB,
GB and GA,
and GA and GF?

Wait, but depending on the order of the points. Let me think. Since triangle D-E-G has points D, E, G. So the edges are DE, EG, and GD. Therefore, line GD connects G to D. So from point G, lines go to D, E, and F (since FG is a line), and A (GA).

Thus, at point G, there are multiple angles:

- Between FG and GD: angle FGD?
- Between GD and GE: angle DGE?
- Between GE and GA: given as 56° (angle EGA)
- Between GA and GF: ?

But we know angle between FG and GA? Not sure yet. Also, angle between FG and GB is 120°, as given (angle BGF). So angle between FG and GB is 120°, which is part of triangle BFG.

Now, considering the full circle around point G, the sum of all angles around G should be 360°. So let's list all angles at G:

1. Between FG and GB: 120°
2. Between GB and GA: ?
3. Between GA and GE: 56°
4. Between GE and GD: ?
5. Between GD and GF: ?

Wait, but maybe there are fewer angles if some are adjacent. Let me try to break it down.

From the given data:

- Angle between FG and GB is 120° (angle BGF)
- Angle between GE and GA is 56° (angle EGA)
- Also, there's angle between GD and something else. Since triangle D-E-G has angle at G, which is angle DGE. Let me denote that as x.

Additionally, there's angle between GD and GF, which might be another angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. However, since the total around G is 360°, we can write equations.

But first, let me check if there are other angles at G. For example, angle between GB and GD? Or between GD and GE?

Alternatively, since triangle D-E-G has angle at G (angle DGE). Let's call that angle y. Also, angle between GE and GA is 56°, and angle between GA and something else. Also, angle between GB and GF is 120°, and angle between GB and GD?

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to find relations between the angles.

Another approach: look at triangle BGC. If we can find angles at B and G, then we can find angle at C. Wait, angle at B in triangle BGC is given as 78°, angle at G is ... ?

Wait, angle at G in triangle BGC would depend on the lines connected. If there's a line from G to C, then angle at G would be part of that. But we don't know if GC exists. However, angle CBG is 78°, which is at B between C and G. So if there is a line from G to C, then triangle BGC would have angle at B of 78°, angle at G, and angle at C.

But without knowing if GC exists, it's hard to say. However, since angle BDC is given, which involves point D and C, and D is connected to E and G, perhaps there's a way to relate these.

Alternatively, consider triangle DGC. If there's a triangle DGC, then angle at D is 50°, and maybe other angles can be determined.

Alternatively, think about triangle DGE. In triangle D-E-G, angles sum to 180°. We know angle at G (angle DGE) is part of that. But we don't know its measure yet. However, if we can find other angles in that triangle, we might be able to compute it.

But how? We know angle EGA is 56°, which is at G between E and A. So that's separate from triangle DGE. Unless point A is related to triangle DGE somehow.

Alternatively, think about line GA. If GA connects G to A, and E is connected to H, maybe there's a relationship between GA and EH? Not sure.

Let me try focusing on the angles given and see if I can find any relationships.

First, angle at B between C and G is 78°, which is angle CBG. So in triangle BCG, if GC exists, that would be one angle. Also, angle at B is 78°, and angle at G would depend on other factors.

But without knowing if GC exists, this is uncertain. However, since angle BDC is given, which involves point C, maybe there's a way to link triangles involving C.

Let me think about triangle ABC. Since it's a triangle, angles at A, B, and C sum to 180°. But we don't have any angle measures for it yet. However, maybe there's a relation between angles in triangle ABC and other parts.

Alternatively, consider the angles around point B. At point B, we have lines connecting to A, C, F, and G. Specifically:

- BA (part of triangle ABC)
- BC (part of triangle ABC)
- BF (line from B to F)
- BG (line from B to G)

So at point B, there are four lines: BA, BC, BF, BG. Therefore, the angles around point B would be:

- Between BA and BC: angle ABC of triangle ABC
- Between BC and BF: ?
- Between BF and BG: ?
- Between BG and BA: ?

But we know one of these angles: angle between BC and BG is 78° (given as angle CBG). Also, angle between BF and BG is 120° (angle BGF)? Wait, no. Angle BGF is at G, not at B. Wait, angle BGF is at G between B and F. So that's angle at G, not B.

At point B, the angles would be:

- Between BA and BC: angle ABC
- Between BC and BG: 78°
- Between BG and BF: ?
- Between BF and BA: ?

But we need more information. However, if we can find the angles at B, maybe we can relate them.

But without knowing other angles, this is difficult. However, maybe there's a way to find other angles using triangle BFG.

In triangle BFG, angles at B and F sum to 60°, as previously noted. Let's denote angle at B (in triangle BFG) as α, and angle at F as β, so α + β = 60°. But we don't know α or β yet.

However, if there's a relation between angle α and other angles at point B.

For example, if line BF is connected to point F, and BG is connected to point G, then the angle between BF and BG would be angle FBG. Is that angle related to anything? Well, angle FBG is part of triangle BFG, which is α. But angle FBG is also adjacent to angle between BG and BA or something else?

Not sure yet. Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the angles around point G. As mentioned before, the total is 360°. The angles around G are:

- Angle between FG and GB: 120° (given)
- Angle between GB and GA: ?
- Angle between GA and GE: 56° (given)
- Angle between GE and GD: ?
- Angle between GD and GF: ?

But this depends on the arrangement of the lines around G. Assuming that the lines from G are in some order, like FG, GB, GA, GE, GD, but without knowing the order, it's challenging.

However, if we can find some of these angles, we can add up to 360°. For example, suppose that between GA and GE is 56°, and between FG and GB is 120°, and other angles are to be determined. But without more info, it's tough.

Wait, but maybe there's a triangle involving point G, E, and A. Since angle EGA is 56°, and line GA connects to A, and GE connects to E. So triangle EGA has angle at G of 56°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle, but we don't have enough info.

Alternatively, consider triangle EGA. If we knew more about it, but we don't.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the angles given and see if there's a way to find the missing angle.

The question is about angle 3. The options are 52, 56, 60, 68. Given that one of the given angles is 56°, which is angle EGA. So angle 3 might be related to that, or another calculation.

Wait, let's look at the angles given:

- Angle BDC = 50°
- Angle CBG = 78°
- Angle BGF = 120°
- Angle EGA = 56°

Perhaps the missing angle is related to these. Let me think about triangle BDC. If angle at D is 50°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe we can find something.

But to have triangle BDC, we need lines BD and CD. Assuming those exist, then angle at D is 50°, and angles at B and C would be something. But without knowing other angles, this is unclear.

Alternatively, consider the straight lines. For example, if line BG is extended beyond G to some point, creating supplementary angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another thought: since angle BGF is 120°, and angle EGA is 56°, maybe there's a way to relate these angles through some triangle or line.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around point G. Suppose that around point G, the angles are:

- Between FG and GB: 120°
- Between GB and GA: let's call this x
- Between GA and GE: 56°
- Between GE and GD: let's call this y
- Between GD and GF: z

Total sum: 120 + x + 56 + y + z = 360. So x + y + z = 360 - 120 - 56 = 184.

But without more info, can't determine individual values.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving GD and something else. Like, triangle DGE. In triangle DGE, angles sum to 180°. One of its angles is at G, which is y (between GE and GD). Another angle is at E, and another at D. But without knowing those, stuck.

Alternatively, think about triangle DGE: if we can find one angle, we can find others. But how?

Wait, angle at E in triangle DGE: is there any info about it? Not directly. But if there's a line EH connected to E, which is part of line EH. So point H is connected to E, but not sure about its relation to other points.

This is really challenging without a visual. Let me try to look for any possible missing pieces.

Wait, angle BDC is 50°, which is at D. If we can find other angles involving D, maybe we can use triangle DBC or something.

But again, without knowing if DC or DB exists, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, let me consider that angle BDC is part of triangle BDC. If I can find other angles in that triangle, maybe using other given info.

For example, if I can find angle at B or C in triangle BDC. But how?

Alternatively, since point D is connected to E and G (from triangle DEG), and line BG is connected to B and G, maybe there's a way to find angle between BD and BG, or something like that.

Alternatively, consider that angle at B between C and G is 78°, and if there's a line from D to B, then angle at B between D and C could be related to angle BDC.

But this is speculative. Maybe I need to make assumptions based on typical configurations.

Another idea: since angle BGF is 120°, which is quite large, suggesting that triangle BFG is obtuse. Also, angle at B in triangle BFG is α, and angle at F is β, with α + β = 60°.

If I can find α or β, that might help. But how?

Suppose there's a line from F to C or something. Not sure.

Wait, looking back at the given lines: Line(B, F), Line(F, G), Line(B, G). So triangle BFG is defined. Also, line BF connects B to F. Are there other lines connected to F? Like, maybe line FC? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the fact that angle at G between B and F is 120°, and angle at G between E and A is 56°, so if these two angles are adjacent, their sum would be 120 + 56 = 176°, leaving 360 - 176 = 184° for the remaining angles around G. But this doesn't directly help.

Wait, maybe angle at G between DG and FG is part of triangle DGF or something. But without knowing about DG, it's unclear.

At this point, I think I need to look for another approach. Let me recall that sometimes in geometry problems, especially with multiple triangles and angles, the missing angle can be found by using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, or using vertical angles, supplementary angles, or other properties.

Let me try to find if there's a triangle where the missing angle can be calculated using known angles.

Consider triangle BFG: angles are 120° at G, and the other two angles at B and F sum to 60°. If I can find one of those angles, I can find the other.

Is there any way to relate angle at B in triangle BFG to other angles?

At point B, we have angle between C and G is 78°, and angle between F and G is part of triangle BFG. Let's say angle at B in triangle BFG is angle FBG. If we can find angle FBG, then we can find angle at F.

But how to find angle FBG? It's part of the angles around point B. At point B, the angles are:

- Between BA and BC: angle ABC (of triangle ABC)
- Between BC and BG: 78° (given)
- Between BG and BF: let's call this x
- Between BF and BA: let's call this y

These angles sum to 360°? No, because point B is a single point, and the angles around it would sum to 360°. Wait, but if there are four lines coming out of B: BA, BC, BF, BG. So the angles between each pair of consecutive lines would sum to 360°.

So the total around point B is:

angle ABC (between BA and BC) + angle CBG (78°) + angle FBG (x) + angle between BF and BA (y) = 360°.

But without knowing angle ABC or the other angles, this is still underdetermined.

However, if we can find angle ABC from elsewhere, that might help. For example, if triangle ABC has some known angles.

But we don't have any information about triangle ABC's angles directly. However, maybe there's a way to relate it through other parts.

Wait, angle BDC is 50°, which might be related to triangle ABC through some transversal or intersection.

Alternatively, think about triangle DBC. If it exists, its angles sum to 180°. Angle at D is 50°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can relate to other parts.

But again, without knowing if DC or DB exist, it's hard to say.

I feel like I'm going in circles here. Let me try to consider the possibility that angle 3 is the missing angle in a certain triangle or around a point.

Given that one of the answer choices is 56°, which is already given as angle EGA. So maybe angle 3 is not that. The other options are 52, 60, 68. Let me think about possible ways to derive these numbers.

For instance, if there's a triangle with angles that sum to 180°, and some angles are known. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 50°, 78°, and something else. But 50 + 78 = 128, so third angle would be 52°, which is option A. Could that be?

Wait, if there's a triangle where two angles are 50° and 78°, then the third angle would be 52°. But which triangle would that be?

If angle at D is 50° (angle BDC), and angle at B is 78° (angle CBG), then if those two angles are part of the same triangle, the third angle would be 52°. But which triangle would that be?

If those two angles are part of triangle BDC, then angle at C would be 52°. But how do we know that?

Wait, if angle at D is 50°, and angle at B is 78°, then in triangle BDC, the third angle at C would be 180 - 50 - 78 = 52°. So angle at C would be 52°, which could be angle 3.

But why would those two angles be in triangle BDC? To have triangle BDC, we need points B, D, C connected. Which requires that there's a line from D to B and from D to C. But earlier, we had that D is connected to E and G, not directly to B or C. So unless there's an intersection or extension of lines.

For example, if line BG passes through D? Or if line DC intersects with some other line at D?

Alternatively, if there's a line from D to C, creating triangle BDC with angle at D being 50°, and angle at B being 78°, leading to angle at C being 52°. But how to justify that angle at B in triangle BDC is 78°?

Because angle CBG is 78°, which is at B between C and G. If line BG is also part of line BD, then angle at B between C and D would be the same as angle CBG. But that would mean that D lies on line BG. If that's the case, then angle CBD would be 78°, and angle at D would be 50°, making angle at C in triangle BDC equal to 52°.

That seems plausible! Let me explore this possibility.

If point D lies on line BG, then line BD is part of line BG. So, in that case, angle at B between C and D would be the same as angle CBG, which is 78°. Then, in triangle BDC, angles at D is 50°, at B is 78°, so angle at C is 180 - 50 - 78 = 52°. So angle at C would be 52°, which could be the measure of angle 3.

But why would point D lie on line BG? Because in triangle DEG, point D is connected to E and G. If line BG passes through D, then D would be on BG. But is there any indication of that?

Well, from the given lines, line BG exists. And point D is part of triangle DEG, which includes point G. So if line BG passes through D, then D would be on BG. But how can we confirm that?

Well, if we assume that, then we can proceed. Let me check if this assumption leads to consistency.

Assume D lies on line BG. Then, in triangle DEG, point D is on line BG. So line DE is connected to D, and line DG is part of triangle DEG. So line DG is from D to G, which is on line BG. So line DG is part of line BG. Hence, line BG contains points B, D, G. So D is between B and G.

In that case, angle at D between B and C is 50°, which would imply that line DC forms angle with DB (which is part of BG). So line DC creates an angle of 50° with DB (which is along BG). 

If this is the case, then in triangle BDC, we have angles at B (78°), D (50°), and C (52°). So angle at C is 52°, which would be the measure of angle 3. 

Given that option A is 52°, this seems likely. But how do I verify this assumption?

Well, if D is on line BG, then in triangle DEG, point D is on BG, and line DE is connected to E. So point E is connected to D and G. So line DE is part of triangle DEG. 

Also, there's line EH connected to E. So point H is on line EH. 

But this assumption allows us to calculate the missing angle as 52°, which is option A. Given that the other options don't seem to fit, and this derivation uses the given angles, it's plausible.

Therefore, the measure of angle 3 is 52°, corresponding to option A.
