<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what's going on here. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points F, G, H, J, K. There are several lines mentioned: Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(F,K), Line(K,J), and Line(F,H). Also, there's a circle K, so maybe point K is the center? Wait, the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(K,J), Circle(K)). So Line(K,J) is a radius of the circle centered at K. That means the length of Line(K,J) is the radius of the circle. But we also have IsSecantOf(Line(F,H), Circle(K)), so Line(F,H) is a secant of the circle. 

Then there are some length equalities: Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), 18), so FG=18. GH=42, FK=15. And the sum of FG and GH equals FH, so FH = 18 + 42 = 60. Wait, but the question asks to find 'a', but the variables given are F G = 18, G H = 42, F K = 15. Wait, maybe the question is referring to finding the length of something else? Let me check again.

Wait, the original question says "Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15." So perhaps 'a' refers to another segment length? Maybe it's referring to the length of Line(F,H)? Because FH was computed as 60. But looking at the answer choices, D is 57. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe they're asking about the radius of the circle?

Wait, the line KJ is a radius. Since K is the center, and J is a point on the circle, so the length KJ is the radius. But do we know the length of KJ? Not directly yet. However, maybe we can use the fact that line FH is a secant of the circle. So line FH intersects the circle at two points. Let me try to visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points F, G, H connected in a straight line since Line(F,G), Line(G,H), and Line(F,H) exist. So F-G-H are colinear, with FG=18 and GH=42, making FH=60. Then there's point K connected to F and K connected to J. Also, line FK has length 15. So point K is somewhere such that FK=15. Also, line KJ is a radius of the circle centered at K, so KJ is the radius. Also, line FH is a secant of the circle, so it passes through the circle, intersecting it at two points. 

Since FH is a secant, maybe it passes through the circle, so points where it intersects the circle could be related to power of a point. Let me recall the Power of a Point theorem. For a point outside a circle, the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points of a secant line is equal to the square of the tangent length. But here, point F is outside the circle, and line FH is a secant. So if line FH intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, then FP * FQ = (FK)^2 - r^2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is FP * FQ = (distance from F to center)^2 - r^2. Or wait, more accurately, if the secant passes through the circle, then FP * FQ = (power of point F with respect to the circle).

But first, let's find the coordinates or relations. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point F at origin (0,0). Then since FG=18, and G is along the line FH. Wait, but FH is a straight line. Wait, points F, G, H are colinear because of Line(F,G), Line(G,H), and Line(F,H). So F---G---H with FG=18, GH=42, so FH=60.

Now, point K is such that FK=15. So point K is somewhere, possibly off the line FH. Also, line KJ is a radius of the circle centered at K. Therefore, J lies on the circle, and KJ is the radius. Also, line FH is a secant of the circle. So line FH passes through the circle, implying that points F and/or H may lie outside or inside the circle. But since FH is a secant, it must pass through the circle, so it must intersect the circle at two points. Let me think about the position of the circle.

Given that K is the center, and KJ is a radius. So the circle has center K and radius KJ. Now, line FH is a secant, so it must pass through the circle. Let me consider the power of point F with respect to the circle. The power of point F would be equal to the square of the tangent from F to the circle, which is also equal to FP * FQ where FP and FQ are the lengths from F to the points where the secant line FH intersects the circle.

Alternatively, since line FH is a secant, and assuming that points F and H are outside the circle, but maybe one is inside? Wait, but if FH is a secant, then it must enter and exit the circle, so two intersection points. Suppose that the line FH intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y. Then FX * FY = power of F. But how does this relate to other elements?

Alternatively, maybe point F is outside the circle, and the line FH passes through the circle, cutting it at two points. Let me assume that. Then the power of point F with respect to the circle is equal to FX * FY = |FK|^2 - r^2, where r is the radius. Wait, no, the power is equal to FX * FY = (distance from F to center)^2 - r^2. Here, the distance from F to the center K is FK = 15. So power of F is FK² - r² = 15² - r². But this should also equal FX * FY. However, I don't know where the secant intersects the circle, but maybe I can express FX and FY in terms of the segments along FH.

But FH is 60 units long. Let me suppose that the line FH intersects the circle at two points. Let me denote the points where line FH intersects the circle as P and Q. Then, depending on whether F is outside or inside the circle, the product FP * FQ would be positive or negative. But since FH is a secant, F must be outside the circle, so the power is positive. So FP * FQ = 15² - r².

However, without knowing where exactly the intersections occur, this seems challenging. But perhaps there's another way. Since K is the center of the circle, and line KJ is a radius, so J is a point on the circle. Also, line KJ connects K to J, which is a radius. But how does that relate to other points?

Wait, maybe J is one of the intersection points of line FH with the circle? Or maybe not. Let me think. If line FH is a secant, then it must intersect the circle at two points. Let me assume that one of these points is J, but that's just a guess. Wait, but J is connected to K via line KJ, which is a radius. So if J is on the circle, then maybe J is one of the intersection points of line FH with the circle. Let me explore this possibility.

Suppose that line FH passes through point J. Then, since J is on the circle, and KJ is a radius. But then, the line KJ is part of the circle's radius. But how does that fit with line FH?

Alternatively, maybe point J is another point on the circle, and line FH passes through J. But then, if J is on line FH, then the distance from F to J would be part of the secant. But without more info, this is speculative.

Wait, but maybe we can use the Power of a Point theorem here. Let me think again. If line FH is a secant passing through the circle, and if we can find the lengths from F to the intersection points, then we can set up an equation involving FK (which is 15), the radius r, and the length of FH (which is 60).

But how? Let's imagine that the secant line FH intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q. Then, FP * FQ = power of F = FK² - r². However, unless we know where P and Q are along FH, we can't compute FP and FQ directly. Unless... perhaps one of the intersection points is H or G? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe point J is the second intersection point. Suppose that line FH passes through J. Then, since J is on the circle, then FJ would be a secant segment. But then, if J is on line FH, then FJ is part of the secant. But then, if we can find FJ, we could use that in the power formula.

But how do we find FJ? Well, let's see. We know FK is 15, and K is the center. If we can find the relationship between K and line FH, maybe we can find coordinates.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point F at (0,0). Let me assume that line FH is the x-axis for simplicity. Then, point F is at (0,0), point G is at (18,0), since FG=18. Then, point H is at (18+42,0) = (60,0), so FH is from (0,0) to (60,0), length 60.

Now, point K is such that FK = 15. So point K is somewhere in the plane at distance 15 from F(0,0). Let me denote K as (x,y), satisfying x² + y² = 15² = 225.

Also, line KJ is a radius of the circle centered at K, so J lies on the circle. Thus, J is a point such that its distance from K is equal to the radius. But we don't know the radius yet. However, line FH is a secant of the circle. So line FH (the x-axis) intersects the circle at two points. Let me find those points.

The circle has center K(x,y) and radius r = KJ. The line FH is the x-axis. To find where the x-axis intersects the circle, substitute y=0 into the circle equation: (X - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = r^2 → (X - x)^2 + y^2 = r^2. Expanding gives X² - 2xX + x² + y² = r². But since r² = (distance from K to J)^2, and J is a point on the circle. However, we don't know J's coordinates yet.

But the line FH (x-axis) intersects the circle at two points. Let me call them P and Q. Then, the power of point F with respect to the circle is FP * FQ = FK² - r² = 15² - r². Also, since the x-axis intersects the circle at P and Q, the product FP * FQ can also be found by solving the quadratic equation for X when y=0.

From earlier, substituting y=0 into the circle equation:

(X - x)^2 + y^2 = r^2 → (X - x)^2 + y² = r² → X² - 2xX + x² + y² = r² → X² - 2xX + (x² + y² - r²) = 0.

But x² + y² is the square of the distance from F to K, which is 15² = 225. So the equation becomes X² - 2xX + (225 - r²) = 0.

The solutions are X = [2x ± sqrt{(2x)^2 - 4*(225 - r²)}]/2 = x ± sqrt{x² - 225 + r²}.

Thus, the roots are X = x + sqrt{x² - 225 + r²} and X = x - sqrt{x² - 225 + r²}. These correspond to the x-coordinates of points P and Q where the x-axis intersects the circle.

Therefore, the distance from F(0,0) to each intersection point is the absolute value of their x-coordinate. So FP * FQ would be the product of the distances from F to P and F to Q. Let me denote the roots as X1 and X2. Then, FP is |X1| and FQ is |X2|. But since the x-axis is the line FH, and points P and Q are on this line, their positions depend on where the circle is located relative to F.

However, without knowing x and r, this seems difficult. But perhaps there's another relation. Remember that line KJ is a radius, so J is a point on the circle. Also, line KJ connects K to J. If J is one of the intersection points P or Q, then J would be either P or Q. Let's suppose J is one of them. For example, suppose J is the intersection point closer to F. Then, FJ would be the distance from F to J, which is one of the roots X1 or X2.

But how do we connect this with other information? Let me think. Suppose that J is one of the intersection points. Then, the distance from K to J is r, which is the radius. Also, since J is on the x-axis (since it's on line FH), its coordinates are (Xj, 0). Then, the distance from K(x,y) to J(Xj, 0) is sqrt[(Xj - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2] = sqrt{(Xj - x)^2 + y²} = r. Squaring both sides: (Xj - x)^2 + y² = r².

But from earlier, we had the equation for the circle: (X - x)^2 + y² = r². So plugging X = Xj, we get that equation holds true. Hence, J is one of the intersection points of the x-axis with the circle.

So, if J is one of the intersection points, then Xj is one of the roots X1 or X2. Let's take Xj as one of them, say Xj = x + sqrt{x² - 225 + r²}, or Xj = x - sqrt{x² - 225 + r²}.

But then, the distance from F to J is |Xj - 0| = |Xj|. So FJ = |Xj|. Also, since J is on the circle, the radius r is the distance from K to J, which is sqrt{(Xj - x)^2 + y²} = r. From earlier, this gives us:

(Xj - x)^2 + y² = r² → expanding, Xj² - 2xXj + x² + y² = r² → but x² + y² = 225, so this becomes Xj² - 2xXj + 225 = r² → rearranged as Xj² - 2xXj + (225 - r²) = 0.

But from the previous quadratic equation for X, we had X² - 2xX + (225 - r²) = 0. So Xj satisfies this equation, hence Xj² - 2xXj + (225 - r²) = 0 → Xj² = 2xXj - (225 - r²).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's go back to the power of point F. The power of F is FP * FQ = 15² - r² = 225 - r². On the other hand, FP and FQ are the distances from F to the two intersection points. If one of the intersection points is J, then FP or FQ is FJ. Let me assume that J is one of the intersection points, say the one closer to F. Then, FJ is one of the distances, and the other distance would be from F to the other intersection point. Let's denote the two intersection points as J and another point, say M. Then, FP * FQ = FJ * FM = 225 - r².

But we need more relations to connect these variables. Perhaps we can find expressions for FJ and FM in terms of other quantities.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the radius r. Let me think. We know that K is at distance 15 from F. Also, the line KJ is a radius, so KJ = r. But K is the center, and J is a point on the circle, so KJ = r. But how does that relate to other parts?

Wait, if J is on the line FH (the x-axis), then the coordinates of J are (Xj, 0). The coordinates of K are (x, y), and the distance from K to J is r. So:

r² = (Xj - x)^2 + y².

But from earlier, we also have that x² + y² = 225 (since FK = 15).

Subtracting these equations:

r² - (x² + y²) = (Xj - x)^2 + y² - x² - y² = (Xj - x)^2 - x² = Xj² - 2xXj + x² - x² = Xj² - 2xXj.

But r² - (x² + y²) = r² - 225.

So:

Xj² - 2xXj = r² - 225.

But from earlier, we had Xj² = 2xXj - (225 - r²) → Xj² = 2xXj - 225 + r² → rearranged:

Xj² - 2xXj + 225 - r² = 0 → which matches the equation from before. This doesn't seem to give new info.

Perhaps I need to find another relation. Let me think about the line FH being a secant. Suppose that the line FH intersects the circle at points J and another point, say M. Then, FJ * FM = 225 - r². But I need to find FJ or FM.

Alternatively, maybe the entire length of FH is related to the positions of J and M. Let me consider that the points on line FH are ordered as F----M----J----H or something like that. But without knowing where J and M are, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but we know that FH is 60 units long. If J is one of the intersection points, then FJ could be a portion of FH. Let's say that J is between F and H. Then, FJ would be less than FH=60. But how to find FJ?

Alternatively, if I can express r in terms of other variables. Let me think. Since K is at distance 15 from F, and J is a point on the circle, then KJ = r. Also, J lies on line FH. Let me write down the coordinates again. Let me assume that J is at (a, 0) on the x-axis. Then, since J is on the circle centered at K(x,y), we have:

(a - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = r².

But also, since FK = 15, x² + y² = 225.

Expanding the first equation:

a² - 2ax + x² + y² = r² → a² - 2ax + 225 = r².

So r² = a² - 2ax + 225.

Now, the power of point F with respect to the circle is 225 - r² = 225 - (a² - 2ax + 225) = -a² + 2ax = 2ax - a² = a(2x - a).

But this power is also equal to FJ * FM, where FJ and FM are the distances from F to the two intersection points. Assuming J is one of them, say J is at (a,0), then FJ = |a - 0| = |a|. Let's assume a > 0 since it's on the x-axis beyond F. So FJ = a. The other intersection point, let's call it M, would have coordinates determined by the quadratic equation earlier. The product FJ * FM = a * FM = 2ax - a². Therefore, FM = 2x - a.

But since FM is the distance from F to M, and M is another intersection point, which could be on the same side as J or opposite. Let me think: if the line FH extends beyond H, then M could be on the extension beyond H, or between F and J. Depending on the position of the circle.

But since FH is a secant, and assuming that J is one of the intersection points, then the other intersection point M would be such that FM * FJ = 2ax - a². But without knowing x or a, this is still abstract.

Wait, but maybe we can relate this to the position of K. Since K is the center of the circle, and J is on the circle, and K is at (x,y). Also, the line KJ is a radius, so vector from K to J is perpendicular to the tangent at J. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, since J is on line FH (the x-axis), the tangent at J would be perpendicular to the radius KJ. The slope of KJ is (0 - y)/(a - x) = -y/(a - x). Therefore, the slope of the tangent at J would be the negative reciprocal, which is (a - x)/y. But since the line FH is the x-axis, which is horizontal, the tangent at J must be vertical if the radius is perpendicular to it. Wait, no—the tangent at J is perpendicular to the radius KJ. If the tangent at J is the x-axis, then the radius KJ must be vertical. Because the tangent is horizontal, so the radius is vertical. Thus, the slope of KJ would be infinite, i.e., vertical line. Therefore, the line KJ is vertical, meaning that the x-coordinate of K and J are the same. So, since J is at (a, 0), K must be at (a, y) for some y. Because the line KJ is vertical, connecting (a, y) to (a, 0).

Ah! This is crucial. If the tangent at J is the x-axis (line FH), then the radius KJ must be perpendicular to the tangent, hence vertical. So KJ is vertical, so K and J share the same x-coordinate. Thus, K is at (a, y), and J is at (a, 0). Therefore, the x-coordinate of K is a. 

This simplifies things greatly. So, K has coordinates (a, y), and J is at (a, 0). Then, the distance from K to J is sqrt((a-a)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = |y|. So the radius r = |y|. 

Additionally, since FK = 15, the distance from F(0,0) to K(a, y) is sqrt((a - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = sqrt(a² + y²) = 15. So:

a² + y² = 225. (Equation 1)

Also, the power of point F with respect to the circle is equal to FJ * FM = 225 - r². But r is |y|, so r² = y². Thus:

FJ * FM = 225 - y². 

But FJ is the distance from F to J, which is |a - 0| = |a|. Assuming a > 0 (since J is on the x-axis and likely to the right of F), so FJ = a. 

What about FM? Since the line FH is the x-axis, and the circle intersects it at J(a,0) and another point M. Let's find the coordinates of M. 

Earlier, we had the quadratic equation for X: X² - 2aX + (225 - y²) = 0. Wait, why? Earlier, when we assumed that K is at (a, y), then the general equation for the circle is (X - a)^2 + (Y - y)^2 = y² (since r² = y²). Expanding this:

X² - 2aX + a² + Y² - 2yY + y² = y² → X² - 2aX + a² + Y² - 2yY = 0.

Setting Y=0 (for the x-axis):

X² - 2aX + a² = 0 → (X - a)^2 = 0 → X = a. 

Wait, that suggests that the x-axis intersects the circle only at X=a, but a single point. That can't be, since a secant should intersect at two points. What's wrong here?

Oh, because if the line FH is tangent to the circle, then it would touch at one point. But the predicate says it's a secant, so it must intersect at two points. Hence, my assumption that the tangent at J is the x-axis implies that the line FH is tangent, contradicting the given that it's a secant. So there's a contradiction here. Which means my earlier conclusion that the radius KJ is vertical is incorrect.

Wait, but if the line FH is a secant, then it cannot be tangent. So my mistake must be in assuming that the tangent at J is the x-axis. Let me re-examine that.

The line FH is a secant, so it intersects the circle at two distinct points. The radius KJ is perpendicular to the tangent at J. But the line FH is not necessarily the tangent; it's a secant. So the tangent at J is different from line FH. Hence, my earlier logic about the radius being vertical was incorrect. 

Let me backtrack. Since the line FH is a secant, it passes through the circle at two points. Let's call them P and Q. The power of point F with respect to the circle is FP * FQ = FK² - r² = 15² - r² = 225 - r². 

But we also know that line FH has total length 60 (from F to H). Let me assume that points P and Q lie on FH, so their positions are along the line from F to H. Let me parameterize FH. Let me consider parametric coordinates. Let me define t as a parameter such that t=0 corresponds to F(0,0), t=1 corresponds to H(60,0), so any point on FH can be written as (60t, 0), where t ∈ [0,1].

Let me assume that the two intersection points divide FH into segments. Let me denote the distances from F to P and F to Q as p and q, respectively. Then, FP * FQ = p * q = 225 - r². Also, since P and Q are on FH, which has total length 60, the positions of P and Q depend on where they are along FH.

But how to relate this to other information? Let's think about the radius r. The circle has center K, and radius r. Also, K is at distance 15 from F. So, the distance between F and K is 15. Let me consider the power of point F: 225 - r² = FP * FQ. 

But without knowing where P and Q are, it's tricky. However, perhaps there's another relation involving K. Since K is the center of the circle, and line KJ is a radius, so J is a point on the circle. But J is not necessarily on line FH. Wait, but the line KJ is a radius, so J could be anywhere on the circle. However, the line FH is a secant, so it intersects the circle at two points. Let me think about the position of K relative to line FH.

If I can find the distance from K to line FH, that might help. The distance from K to line FH (which is the x-axis) is the y-coordinate of K, since the line FH is the x-axis. Let me denote this distance as d = |y|. Then, the power of point F with respect to the circle is also equal to (distance from F to center)^2 - r² = 15² - r². But also, the power can be expressed as (distance from F to line FH)^2 - (distance from line FH to circle)^2? No, that's not standard. Wait, the power of a point with respect to a circle is also equal to the square of the distance from the point to the center minus the square of the radius. 

Alternatively, if I consider the line FH, which is at distance d from K, then the number of intersections depends on whether d < r, d = r (tangent), or d > r (no intersection). Since FH is a secant, d < r. So, the distance from K to line FH is less than r. 

But how does this help? Let me calculate d. Since line FH is the x-axis, and K is at (x, y), then d = |y|. Also, the distance from F to K is sqrt(x² + y²) = 15. So x² + y² = 225. 

The power of F is 225 - r² = FP * FQ. Also, since the distance from K to line FH is d = |y|, and the radius is r, then the line FH intersects the circle if d < r. So, |y| < r. 

But how to relate this to FP * FQ? Let me think. The line FH is at distance d from K. The length of the chord (intersection points) can be calculated using the formula: length = 2*sqrt(r² - d²). But this is the length of the chord created by line FH. However, the chord length is the distance between the two intersection points P and Q on line FH. Let me denote this length as L. Then, L = 2√(r² - d²). 

But the total length of FH is 60, and the chord length L is a part of this. However, without knowing where the chord is positioned along FH, it's unclear how L relates to 60. 

But if I assume that the entire length of FH is the chord, then L = 60, so 60 = 2√(r² - d²) → √(r² - d²) = 30 → r² - d² = 900 → r² = d² + 900. 

But we also know that d = |y|, and x² + y² = 225. So, from x² + y² = 225, we have x² = 225 - y². 

Also, r is the radius, which is the distance from K to any point on the circle, including J. But we don't know where J is. However, since line KJ is a radius, and J is a point on the circle, then KJ = r. 

But how to connect this? Let me think. If I can find r in terms of d, and then use other relations.

From above, r² = d² + 900. Also, since x² + y² = 225, and d = |y|, then x² = 225 - y² = 225 - d². 

But I don't see how to proceed further without more information.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between x and the chord length. The chord length L = 60 = 2√(r² - d²) → r² - d² = 900. 

But from x² + y² = 225, and d = y, so x² = 225 - d². 

But also, r is the radius, which is the distance from K to J. But J is a point on the circle. If J is not on line FH, then the distance from K to J is r, but we don't know where J is. 

This seems stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simpler. The question asks to find 'a', which in the answer choices is likely the length of FH, but FH is already given as 60. But 60 isn't among the options. Wait, the answer choices are A.15, B.18, C.42, D.57. None of these are 60. So perhaps 'a' refers to something else. 

Wait, the problem says: "Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15." So maybe 'a' is the length of FK? But FK is given as 15, which is option A. But the options include 15 as A. But the question might be asking for something else. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the length of FJ? Or maybe the length of the secant segment? Let me re-read the problem statement.

The question is: "Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15."

Wait, this is ambiguous. It could mean that the question is asking to find the value of a, where a is some quantity defined in the problem. But since the problem includes a lot of predicates, perhaps 'a' refers to the length of a particular segment. Given that the answer choices are numerical, and the given data includes FG=18, GH=42, FK=15, and FH=60, maybe 'a' is referring to the length of the secant segment or something else.

Wait, let me look back at the initial problem. The user provided a list of predicates, including IsSecantOf(Line(F,H), Circle(K)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(K,J), Circle(K)). So the question might be asking for the length of KJ, which is the radius, or something else.

Wait, the question is: "Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15." So it's possible that 'a' is the length of KJ, the radius. Let me try to find that.

If I can find the radius r = KJ. How?

Using the power of point F: FP * FQ = 225 - r².

But also, the line FH is a secant, so FP * FQ = (distance from F to P) * (distance from F to Q). If I can express this in terms of other quantities.

Assume that the secant line FH intersects the circle at two points P and Q. Let me assume that F is outside the circle, and the secant goes through P and Q, with FP and FQ being the distances from F to P and F to Q. Then, FP * FQ = 225 - r².

But without knowing where P and Q are, it's hard to calculate. However, if I can relate this to the length of FH=60. Suppose that the entire length of FH is the secant, so that P and Q are at the ends of FH. But that would mean that FP = 0 and FQ = 60, but that would imply FP * FQ = 0, which would mean 225 - r² = 0 → r = 15. But then the radius would be 15, and K is at distance 15 from F, so the circle would have center K and radius 15, making F lie on the circle. But then line FH would be a tangent or secant? If F is on the circle, then line FH would be a tangent if it touches at F, but since it's a secant, it must intersect at two points. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the points P and Q are somewhere along FH, and the product FP * FQ can be related to the length of FH. Let me think about the case where the secant passes through the circle, entering at P and exiting at Q. Then, FP is the distance from F to P, and FQ is from F to Q. If P is between F and Q, then FQ = FP + PQ. But without knowing where P and Q are, it's still unclear.

Wait, but maybe the line FH passes through the circle, and one of the intersection points is H. Let's assume that H is one of the intersection points. Then, the distance from F to H is 60, and since H is on the circle, then FH is a tangent or secant. If H is on the circle, then the power of F would be FH * 0 = 0, which implies 225 - r² = 0 → r = 15. But then K is at distance 15 from F, so K would be on the circle. But then line KJ is a radius, so J would be another point on the circle. This seems possible. Let me explore this scenario.

If H is on the circle, then FH is a tangent to the circle at H, because it touches the circle at H. But the predicate says it's a secant, so it should intersect at two points. Hence, this is impossible. So H cannot be on the circle.

Alternatively, maybe the secant passes through H and another point. Let me assume that one intersection point is H. Then, the other point would be somewhere else. Let me denote the other intersection point as M. Then, FH * FM = 225 - r². But FH is 60, and FM would be the distance from F to M. If M is between F and H, then FM < FH, and HM = FH - FM. But this is too vague.

Wait, but if I assume that the other intersection point is G, but FG=18. Let me try that. If G is on the circle, then FG is a tangent or secant. If G is on the circle, then the power of F would be FG * 0 = 0, leading to r = 15. Again, similar to before. But this might not hold.

Alternatively, maybe the secant passes through G and H. But since GH=42, and FG=18, FH=60. If both G and H are on the circle, then the power of F would be FG * FH = 18 * 60 = 1080 = 225 - r² → r² = 225 - 1080 = -855, which is impossible. So this is invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. Let me try another approach.

Let me recall that in a secant-tangent scenario, if there's a secant and a tangent, the power of the point is equal to the square of the tangent length. But here, there's only a secant. However, if I can find a tangent from F to the circle, then the power of F would be equal to the square of the tangent length. But I don't know if there is a tangent.

But since FH is a secant, and we have FK = 15, maybe there's a relation between FK and the tangent. Let me assume that the minimum distance from F to the circle is the length of the tangent, which is sqrt(FK² - r²). But this is equal to the power of F, which is FP * FQ. 

But without knowing FP or FQ, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but maybe the length of the secant can be expressed in terms of the power. Let me recall that if a secant from F passes through the circle, intersecting it at P and Q, then FP * FQ = power of F. If I can express FP and FQ in terms of the length of the secant.

Let me assume that the secant passes through the circle, with P and Q on the secant. Let me denote FP = x and FQ = x + y, where y is the length from P to Q. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, if the entire length of the secant from F to the farthest point is FQ, and the near point is FP, then FQ = FP + PQ, where PQ is the length of the chord. But again, without knowing where the points are, it's hard.

Wait, but if I consider that the line FH has total length 60, and it's a secant, then the product FP * FQ = 225 - r². But I need to relate this to the length of FH.

Let me consider that the points P and Q are located along FH such that FP = a and FQ = b, with a * b = 225 - r². Also, since P and Q are on FH, the distance between P and Q is |b - a|, which is the length of the chord. But the length of the chord is also 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from K to line FH. As before, this leads to 2√(r² - d²) = |b - a|. 

But I also know that d is the distance from K to line FH, which is |y|, and x² + y² = 225. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the possible answer choices. The options are 15, 18, 42, 57. Given that FK is 15, and FH is 60, and GH is 42, maybe the answer is related to the Pythagorean theorem or some other relation.

Wait, let me consider the possibility that the problem involves the Power of a Point theorem. If line FH is a secant, and FK is the distance from F to the center K, then the power of F is FK² - r² = 15² - r². Also, since FH is a secant, let's say it intersects the circle at P and Q, then FP * FQ = 15² - r². 

But if I can find FP and FQ in terms of known quantities. Suppose that the secant passes through G and H, but GH is 42. Wait, if G is inside the circle, and H is outside, then FG = 18, GH = 42, so FH = 60. The power of F would be FG * (FG + GH) = 18 * (18 + 42) = 18 * 60 = 1080. But this would mean 15² - r² = 1080 → r² = 225 - 1080 = -855, which is impossible. So this can't be.

Alternatively, if G is outside the circle and H is inside, then the power of F would be FG * (FG - GH) = 18 * (18 - 42) = negative, which also doesn't make sense.

Wait, but the Power of a Point theorem states that if a secant passes through the circle, then FP * FQ = power. If F is outside, and the secant passes through the circle at P and Q, then FP and FQ are both positive, and the product is positive. If F is inside, then it would be negative. But since FH is a secant, F must be outside, so the product is positive.

But how to determine FP and FQ? Let me think: if the line FH passes through the circle, and let's say the points of intersection are at distances x and y from F, then x * y = 225 - r². But without knowing x and y, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but if I assume that the entire length of FH is the secant, and one of the points is at F itself. But that would mean F is on the circle, making the power zero, which would imply r = 15. But then the radius is 15, and K is at distance 15 from F, so K is on the circle. Then, line KJ is a radius, so J would be another point on the circle. But then the line FH is a secant, which would mean it passes through two points on the circle. If F is on the circle, then the secant would pass through F and another point, say H. But then H would also be on the circle, making FH a chord. But then the power of F would be zero, which matches 225 - r² = 0 → r = 15. 

But in this case, the length of the chord FH would be 60, and the radius is 15. But the maximum possible length of a chord in a circle is the diameter, which is 2r = 30. But 60 > 30, which is impossible. Hence, this is a contradiction. So this scenario is invalid.

This suggests that my earlier approaches are missing something. Let me try to revisit the problem with fresh eyes.

Given:
- FG = 18, GH = 42, so FH = 60.
- FK = 15
