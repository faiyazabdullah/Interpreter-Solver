====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. 

So, we have a triangle RQS. The points R, Q, and S are all points, and there are three lines: QR, RS, and QS. These lines are sides of the triangle. Also, it says that the triangle is isosceles. Wait, but which sides are equal? Because in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. But here, there's another predicate saying that the lengths of QR and RS are congruent. Let me check that again.

Looking at the given predicates: 
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,R)), 5x) → So QR has length 5x.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), 6x - 5) → RS is 6x -5.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), 3x + 10) → QS is 3x +10.
Then, Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(R,S)) → So QR ≅ RS. Therefore, their lengths should be equal. That means 5x equals 6x -5. Solving that equation would give x. Once I find x, I can compute the length of QS, which is 3x +10. Then, check if that's one of the options.

Wait, but also, since the triangle is isosceles, maybe there's another pair of equal sides? But according to the congruence given, QR and RS are congruent. So that would make the triangle have two equal sides: QR and RS. Therefore, the base would be QS. So the third side is QS. 

But let me confirm. Since QR = RS, so the triangle RQS has sides QR, RS, QS. QR = RS, so it's an isosceles triangle with legs QR and RS, and base QS. Therefore, the base angles at Q and S would be equal. However, the problem mentions the triangle is isosceles, which aligns with QR = RS. 

Now, the key is to use the congruence of QR and RS. So setting 5x = 6x -5. Solving for x:

5x = 6x -5  
Subtract 5x from both sides: 0 = x -5  
Therefore, x = 5.

Once x is found, plug into QS's expression: 3x +10. Substituting x=5 gives 3*5 +10 = 15 +10 = 25. So QS would be 25 units long. Looking at the answer choices, D is 25. 

Wait, but let me double-check if there's another possibility. For example, could the isosceles triangle have different sides? Suppose instead that the congruent sides were QR and QS, or RS and QS. But the problem states that Congruent(Line(Q,R), Line(R,S)), so that specifically tells us QR and RS are congruent. Therefore, the other sides are not necessarily congruent. Hence, our calculation holds. 

Another check: After finding x=5, let's verify all side lengths. QR is 5x = 25, RS is 6x -5 = 6*5 -5 = 30-5=25. QS is 3x+10= 15+10=25. Wait, hold on! All three sides are equal? That would make it an equilateral triangle, but the problem says it's isosceles. Hmm, but maybe the definition allows for equilateral triangles to be considered isosceles? In some definitions, yes. An equilateral triangle is a special case of an isosceles triangle where all three sides are equal. So even though all sides are equal here, it still satisfies being isosceles. 

But wait, if all sides are equal, then the triangle is equilateral. But the problem didn't specify that it's not equilateral, just that it's isosceles. So that's acceptable. Therefore, the length of QS is 25, which corresponds to answer D. 

But let me check if there's any mistake in my calculation. When x=5, QR is 5x=25, RS is 6x-5=25, and QS is 3x+10=25. So all sides are 25. So yes, the triangle is equilateral. But since the problem says it's isosceles, that's okay. So the answer is D, 25. Therefore, the correct answer choice is D.
