Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. The main goal is to find the measure of angle KJL, which is angle at point J between points K and L. 

Starting with the Parallelogram(J,K,L,M). So, J, K, L, M form a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But wait, there are also some specific lines mentioned here. Let me note down all the given info.

First, Points J, K, L, M are defined. Then Lines: JK, KL, LM, MJ. Also, lines JL and KM intersect at point R. Additionally, several length equalities are given. Length of JK is 2b + 3, KL is 21, LM is 45, MJ is 3a. Angles: Measure of angle MLK (which is angle at L between M and K) is 70 degrees, and angle JMK (at M between J and K) is 30 degrees. Also, lines JK and ML are parallel, as well as JM and KL. Also, congruence between certain lines: JK congruent to ML, and JM congruent to KL. Also, R is midpoint of both JL and KM.

Wait, since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal. So JK = ML and JM = KL. Given that, the lengths of JK and ML are given as 2b+3 and 45 respectively? Wait, no. Wait, the given equals are:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)), 2b + 3)

So Length of JK is 2b + 3.

Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,L)), 21): so KL is 21.

Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,M)), 45): LM is 45.

And Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,J)), 3a): MJ is 3a.

But since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, JK = ML and JM = KL. So ML is same as JK, which would mean 45 equals 2b + 3? Wait, ML is given as 45, so JK must also be 45. Therefore, 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b=21. Similarly, JM = KL. KL is given as 21, so JM is 3a. Hence, 3a = 21 → a=7. So we can find the values of a and b if needed later.

Now, angles: Measure of Angle(M,L,K) is 70 degrees. That angle is at point L between points M, L, K. Since in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, but maybe we can use triangle properties here. Also, angle JMK is 30 degrees. That's angle at M between J, M, K.

Also, lines JK and ML are parallel, and JM and KL are parallel. Which aligns with the properties of a parallelogram.

Additionally, R is the midpoint of both JL and KM. Since in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Wait, but here the lines JL and KM are being considered. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM? Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals of a parallelogram connect opposite vertices. So in a parallelogram JKL M, the diagonals would be JL and KM. Because J connects to L, and K connects to M. And since R is the intersection point of these two diagonals, and R is the midpoint of both. Which confirms that the diagonals bisect each other, which is a property of parallelograms.

Now, the question is to find m∠KJL. That's angle at point J between points K and L. So angle KJL is the angle at vertex J formed by segments JK and JL. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the sides adjacent to J are JK and JM. Wait, because in a parallelogram, each vertex has two adjacent sides. So J is connected to K and M. So angle KJM would be one of the angles of the parallelogram. However, the question asks for ∠KJL, which is angle at J between K and L. Wait, but L is another vertex. Let me visualize the parallelogram.

Let me sketch mentally: Parallelogram J-K-L-M. So order of the vertices is J, K, L, M connected such that JK is one side, KL next, LM, and MJ. So the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Then the diagonals are JL and KM. So point R is where these diagonals intersect, and it's the midpoint of both.

So angle KJL is at point J, between points K and L. So that would be angle between JK and JL. Wait, because JL is the diagonal from J to L. So in triangle JKL, angle at J. Wait, but in the parallelogram, J is connected to K and M. So JL is a diagonal. So angle KJL is part of triangle JKL.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle JKL. But since it's a parallelogram, maybe we can use properties of parallelograms and triangles to find the angle.

Given that, we know some angles. For example, angle at L (MLK) is 70 degrees. Also, angle at M (JMK) is 30 degrees. Maybe those can help us find other angles.

Let me think about the angles in the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at J plus angle at K equals 180 degrees. But without knowing specific measures, maybe we need to use the given angles.

Wait, the given angles are angle MLK (which is angle at L between M, L, K) and angle JMK (angle at M between J, M, K). Let me try to mark these angles.

Angle MLK is at point L, between points M, L, K. So that's angle between LM and LK. Since LM is a side of the parallelogram, and LK is another side. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but maybe this angle is part of triangle LKM?

Similarly, angle JMK is at point M between J, M, K. So that's angle between JM and MK. Again, part of triangle JMK.

But how does this help us find angle KJL?

Alternatively, since we have midpoints and diagonals, maybe we can consider triangle JKL. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So R is the midpoint of JL and KM. So JR = RL and KR = RM.

But maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry could help here. Alternatively, using the law of sines or cosines in some triangles.

Another thought: since we know some side lengths, maybe we can compute coordinates for the points and calculate the angle.

Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point J at the origin (0,0). Since JK is a side of the parallelogram, and we know its length is 2b + 3, which we found earlier to be 45 (since ML is 45 and JK=ML). Wait, earlier calculation: since JK is equal to ML, which is 45. So 2b + 3 = 45 → b=21. So JK is 45 units long.

Also, JM is equal to KL, which is given as 21. So JM = 21. Since JM is another side of the parallelogram. So if I set up coordinates, let me assume that.

Let me define point J at (0,0). Let me take vector JK as along x-axis for simplicity. So point K is at (45, 0), since JK is 45 units. Now, since JM is another side, which is length 21. Let me denote the coordinates of M. Since in a parallelogram, vector JM is equal to vector KL. Wait, but KL is from K to L, which is a vector. Hmm, maybe better to use vectors here.

Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the coordinates can be determined based on vectors. Let me suppose that vector JK is (45, 0), as before. Then vector JM is some vector, say (p, q), with magnitude 21. Then point M would be at (p, q). Then point L would be at K + vector JM, because in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector KL equals vector JM. So vector KL = vector JM. Vector KL is from K to L, which is L - K. Since K is at (45,0), and L is at (45 + p, 0 + q). Wait, no. Wait, if we start from J(0,0), K(45,0), then M(p,q), then L would be K + vector JM. Vector JM is from J to M, which is (p, q). So adding that to point K gives L as (45 + p, 0 + q).

Therefore, coordinates:

J: (0,0)

K: (45, 0)

M: (p, q)

L: (45 + p, q)

Now, the diagonals are JL and KM. Diagonal JL goes from J(0,0) to L(45+p, q). Diagonal KM goes from K(45,0) to M(p, q). Their intersection is R, which is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So midpoint of JL is ((45+p)/2, q/2). Midpoint of KM is ((45 + p)/2, (0 + q)/2). So yes, same point R, confirming that R is the midpoint.

Now, given that, we can use the given angles. Let's look at angle MLK, which is angle at L between points M, L, K. Let me compute that angle.

Points:

M: (p, q)

L: (45 + p, q)

K: (45, 0)

So angle at L between points M, L, K. So vectors LM and LK.

Vector LM is M - L: (p - (45 + p), q - q) = (-45, 0)

Vector LK is K - L: (45 - (45 + p), 0 - q) = (-p, -q)

So angle between vectors LM (-45, 0) and LK (-p, -q) is 70 degrees.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (LM • LK) / (|LM| |LK|)

Compute LM • LK = (-45)(-p) + (0)(-q) = 45p

|LM| = sqrt((-45)^2 + 0^2) = 45

|LK| = sqrt((-p)^2 + (-q)^2) = sqrt(p² + q²)

Thus,

cos(70°) = 45p / (45 * sqrt(p² + q²)) ) → simplifying:

cos(70°) = p / sqrt(p² + q²)

Which implies that p / sqrt(p² + q²) = cos(70°)

Let me square both sides:

p² / (p² + q²) = cos²(70°)

So,

p² = cos²(70°) * (p² + q²)

Rearranged:

p² = cos²(70°)*p² + cos²(70°)*q²

Bring terms together:

p² - cos²(70°)*p² = cos²(70°)*q²

Factor left side:

p²[1 - cos²(70°)] = cos²(70°)*q²

Note that 1 - cos²(theta) = sin²(theta):

p² sin²(70°) = cos²(70°) q²

Divide both sides by cos²(70°):

(p² / q²) = cot²(70°)

Take square roots:

p/q = cot(70°)

So tan(theta) = q/p = tan(70°), where theta is the angle whose tangent is q/p.

Wait, since p/q = cot(70°), then q/p = tan(70°). So the slope of vector JM (from J to M) is q/p = tan(70°). Therefore, the angle between JM and the x-axis is 70 degrees? Wait, but vector JM is from J(0,0) to M(p, q), so the direction of JM makes an angle phi with the x-axis where tan(phi) = q/p. And we just found that q/p = tan(70°), so phi = 70 degrees. So the angle between JM and the x-axis is 70 degrees.

But JM is one of the sides of the parallelogram. Let me recall that JM has length 21. Since vector JM has components (p, q), then sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. Also, since tan(phi)=q/p=tan(70°), so phi=70°, so:

p = 21 * cos(70°)

q = 21 * sin(70°)

Therefore, we can compute p and q.

But let me check if this is consistent with the other given angle: angle JMK is 30 degrees. Let me verify that.

Angle JMK is at point M between points J, M, K. So vectors MJ and MK.

Point M is at (p, q). Vector MJ is J - M = (-p, -q). Vector MK is K - M = (45 - p, 0 - q) = (45 - p, -q).

So angle between vectors MJ and MK is 30 degrees.

Again, using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (MJ • MK) / (|MJ| |MK|)

Compute the dot product:

(-p)(45 - p) + (-q)(-q) = -45p + p² + q²

|MJ| is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21

|MK| is sqrt((45 - p)^2 + (-q)^2) = sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² )

So:

cos(30°) = [ -45p + p² + q² ] / [21 * sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² ) ]

This seems complicated, but maybe we can substitute p and q from earlier expressions.

Earlier, we had:

p = 21 cos(70°)

q = 21 sin(70°)

Let me compute p and q numerically first.

Calculate cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420, sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

So p ≈ 21 * 0.3420 ≈ 7.182

q ≈ 21 * 0.9397 ≈ 19.7337

Now, let's plug into the numerator:

-45p + p² + q²

First, compute p² + q² = (21)^2 = 441 (since sqrt(p² + q²)=21)

So the numerator becomes:

-45p + 441

Substituting p ≈ 7.182:

Numerator ≈ -45*(7.182) + 441 ≈ -323.19 + 441 ≈ 117.81

Denominator is 21 * sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² )

Compute 45 - p ≈ 45 - 7.182 ≈ 37.818

So (45 - p)^2 ≈ (37.818)^2 ≈ approx 1430

q² ≈ (19.7337)^2 ≈ approx 389.4

Sum inside sqrt: 1430 + 389.4 ≈ 1819.4 → sqrt(1819.4) ≈ 42.65

So denominator ≈ 21 * 42.65 ≈ 895.65

So cos(theta) ≈ 117.81 / 895.65 ≈ 0.1315

What angle has cosine ≈ 0.1315? Let me check cos(82.5°) ≈ 0.1305. Close enough. So theta ≈ 82.5 degrees. But the given angle is supposed to be 30 degrees. There's a contradiction here. Which suggests that my assumption may be wrong.

Hmm, that indicates that my previous conclusion that phi = 70 degrees might be incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the angle MLK. Earlier, I considered angle at L between M, L, K. The vectors were LM and LK. Vector LM was from L to M: M - L = (-45, 0). Vector LK is from L to K: K - L = (-p, -q). Then the angle between these vectors is 70 degrees. But perhaps I made a mistake in computing the angle. Wait, the angle between vectors LM and LK is indeed angle MLK. However, the calculation led to the conclusion that the slope of JM is tan(70°), leading to phi=70°, but this caused inconsistency with the second angle.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the vectors. Let me double-check the angle calculation.

At point L, vectors are LM and LK. So vector LM is from L to M: M - L = (p - (45 + p), q - q) = (-45, 0). Correct. Vector LK is from L to K: K - L = (45 - (45 + p), 0 - q) = (-p, -q). Correct.

Dot product of LM and LK is (-45)(-p) + (0)(-q) = 45p. Correct.

|LM| is sqrt( (-45)^2 + 0^2 ) = 45. Correct.

|LK| is sqrt( (-p)^2 + (-q)^2 ) = sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. Wait! Wait, earlier I said that sqrt(p² + q²) is 21? No, wait. Wait, JM is the side from J to M, which has length 3a, and we found that a=7, so JM = 21. Yes, so sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. So |LK| is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. Therefore, the denominator is 45 * 21 = 945.

So cos(theta) = 45p / (45*21) = p / 21 → cos(theta) = p / 21. And theta is 70 degrees. So:

cos(70°) = p / 21 → p = 21 * cos(70°)

Ah, earlier I thought that p / sqrt(p² + q²) = cos(theta), but actually, sqrt(p² + q²) is 21, so it's p / 21. So the previous mistake was in thinking that sqrt(p² + q²) was something else. So that correction changes things.

So p = 21*cos(70°), and q = sqrt(21² - p²) = sqrt(441 - p²). Wait, since p² + q² = 441.

So once again, p = 21*cos(70°), q = 21*sin(70°). So that part is correct.

Now, going back to the second angle, angle JMK at point M between J, M, K. Let me recalculate that with corrected values.

Vectors MJ and MK.

Vector MJ is from M to J: J - M = (-p, -q)

Vector MK is from M to K: K - M = (45 - p, 0 - q) = (45 - p, -q)

Dot product of MJ and MK is (-p)(45 - p) + (-q)(-q) = -45p + p² + q².

As before, p² + q² = 441, so this becomes -45p + 441.

The magnitudes:

|MJ| is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21

|MK| is sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + (-q)^2 ) = sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² )

So cos(theta) = [ -45p + 441 ] / [ 21 * sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² ) ]

Plugging in p = 21 cos(70°):

Let me compute numerical values.

First, compute p = 21 * cos(70°). Cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420, so p ≈ 21 * 0.3420 ≈ 7.182.

Then, -45p + 441 ≈ -45*(7.182) + 441 ≈ -323.19 + 441 ≈ 117.81.

Now, compute denominator:

sqrt( (45 - p)^2 + q² ). We know q = 21 sin(70°). Let me compute q:

sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397, so q ≈ 21 * 0.9397 ≈ 19.7337.

So (45 - p) ≈ 45 - 7.182 ≈ 37.818. Squared: (37.818)^2 ≈ 1430. q squared is (19.7337)^2 ≈ 389.4. Sum: 1430 + 389.4 ≈ 1819.4. Square root is sqrt(1819.4) ≈ 42.65.

So denominator is 21 * 42.65 ≈ 895.65.

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 117.81 / 895.65 ≈ 0.1315.

Now, arccos(0.1315) is approximately 82.5 degrees. But the given angle is 30 degrees. This discrepancy suggests that there's a mistake in assumptions.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, angle JMK is 30 degrees. Our calculation shows that with the current setup, it results in ~82.5 degrees. Contradiction. What went wrong?

Perhaps my initial assumption about the angle MLK is incorrect? Or maybe I mixed up the vectors for the angle MLK?

Let me recheck the angle MLK. At point L, between M, L, K. So the angle is between LM and LK. Wait, but LM is from L to M, and LK is from L to K. So vectors are LM and LK emanating from L. Wait, but earlier I used vectors LM and LK as vectors starting from L? Or from the origin?

No, in the dot product, vectors should originate from the same point. So for angle at L, vectors should be from L to M and from L to K. So vectors are LM and LK, originating at L.

Wait, earlier I computed vectors LM as M - L and LK as K - L. So that's correct. So the calculation is correct. So why the discrepancy?

Maybe there's a misunderstanding of which angle is given. The problem says "MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))", which is angle at L between M, L, K. So that's angle MLK. But according to our calculation, this leads to an inconsistency with angle JMK. Perhaps I need to revisit the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the side JM has length 21. Wait, JM is equal to KL. KL is given as 21. Yes, since in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So JM = KL = 21. So that's correct.

Wait, but let's think differently. Suppose instead of assigning coordinates, we use the properties of the parallelogram and triangle angles.

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Also, the sum of all angles is 360 degrees.

But we have some angles given. Let me see.

We have angle at L (MLK) as 70 degrees. Let me consider triangle LKM. Wait, but in the parallelogram, what is the relationship between these angles?

Wait, in triangle LKM, angle at L is 70 degrees. What are the other angles?

But point K is connected to L and M. Wait, in the parallelogram, LM is one side, and LK is another side. Wait, but LM is a side of the parallelogram, which is equal to JK (45), and LK is a side equal to JM (21). So triangle LKM has sides LM = 45, LK = 21, and KM. Wait, but KM is a diagonal of the parallelogram. Wait, but I don't know its length yet.

Alternatively, since we know angle at L is 70 degrees, and sides adjacent to it are LM = 45 and LK = 21. So using the Law of Cosines in triangle LKM to find KM:

KM² = LM² + LK² - 2 * LM * LK * cos(angle at L)

KM² = 45² + 21² - 2*45*21*cos(70°)

Let me compute this:

45² = 2025

21² = 441

So KM² = 2025 + 441 - 2*45*21*cos(70°)

Compute 2*45*21 = 1890

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

So 1890 * 0.3420 ≈ 1890 * 0.342 ≈ let's compute 1890 * 0.3 = 567, 1890 * 0.042 = 1890 * 0.04 = 75.6, 1890 * 0.002 = 3.78; total ≈ 75.6 + 3.78 = 79.38 → total ≈ 567 + 79.38 = 646.38

So KM² ≈ 2025 + 441 - 646.38 = 2466 - 646.38 = 1819.62

Thus, KM ≈ sqrt(1819.62) ≈ 42.65, which matches the earlier calculation.

Now, in triangle JMK, angle at M is 30 degrees. Let me apply the Law of Sines in triangle JMK.

Wait, triangle JMK has points J, M, K. Let me identify the sides and angles.

In triangle JMK:

- Side JM = 21 (given)
- Side MK ≈ 42.65 (calculated above)
- Side JK = 45 (given)
- Angle at M is 30 degrees.

Applying the Law of Sines:

sin(angle at J) / MK = sin(angle at M) / JK

Wait, let me label the triangle properly.

In triangle JMK:

- Vertex J, M, K
- Angle at M is 30 degrees.
- Sides: JM = 21, MK ≈ 42.65, JK = 45.

Law of Sines states:

sin(angle at J) / MK = sin(angle at M) / JK

So:

sin(angle at J) = (MK / JK) * sin(angle at M)

Plug in numbers:

MK ≈ 42.65, JK = 45, angle at M = 30 degrees.

So sin(angle at J) ≈ (42.65 / 45) * sin(30°)

Compute 42.65 / 45 ≈ 0.9478

sin(30°) = 0.5

Thus, sin(angle at J) ≈ 0.9478 * 0.5 ≈ 0.4739

Then angle at J ≈ arcsin(0.4739) ≈ 28.3 degrees or 180 - 28.3 = 151.7 degrees. Since angle at M is 30 degrees, and the triangle's angles sum to 180, the angle at J can't be too large. So likely 28.3 degrees.

But what is angle at J in triangle JMK? It is angle at J between points M and K, which is angle JMK? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle JMK, the angle at J is between sides JM and JK. Wait, but angle at J in the parallelogram is different. Wait, the angle at J in the parallelogram is between sides JK and JM. Which is angle KJM. But the question asks for angle KJL, which is angle at J between K and L.

Wait, so angle KJL is different from angle KJM. How are these related?

Since L is a vertex of the parallelogram, and JL is a diagonal. So angle KJL is the angle between JK and JL at point J. So it's different from angle KJM (which is one of the internal angles of the parallelogram).

To find angle KJL, perhaps we can use triangle JKL.

In triangle JKL, we have points J, K, L.

We know:

- JK = 45 (side)
- KL = 21 (side)
- JL is the diagonal, which we can compute.

From earlier, in triangle LKM, we found KM ≈ 42.65. But JL is another diagonal. In a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy the relation:

JL² + KM² = 2(JK² + KL²)

Wait, is that true? Wait, in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides.

Yes, the formula is:

JL² + KM² = 2(JK² + KL²)

So substituting known values:

JL² + (approx 42.65)^2 = 2*(45² + 21²)

We already computed KM² as approx 1819.62, so:

JL² + 1819.62 = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*(2466) = 4932

So JL² = 4932 - 1819.62 ≈ 3112.38 → JL ≈ sqrt(3112.38) ≈ 55.79 units.

Now, in triangle JKL, sides are:

JK = 45, KL = 21, JL ≈ 55.79.

We need to find angle at J, which is angle KJL.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle JKL:

cos(angle KJL) = (JK² + JL² - KL²) / (2 * JK * JL)

Wait, no. Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). So rearranged:

cos(C) = (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)

Here, angle at J is between sides JK and JL, opposite to side KL.

Wait, in triangle JKL:

- Side opposite angle at J is KL = 21
- Side JK = 45
- Side JL ≈ 55.79

So applying Law of Cosines:

KL² = JK² + JL² - 2 * JK * JL * cos(angle KJL)

Rearranged:

cos(angle KJL) = (JK² + JL² - KL²) / (2 * JK * JL)

Plugging in values:

JK² = 2025

JL² ≈ 3112.38

KL² = 441

So numerator: 2025 + 3112.38 - 441 = (2025 - 441) + 3112.38 = 1584 + 3112.38 = 4696.38

Denominator: 2 * 45 * 55.79 ≈ 2 * 45 * 55.79 ≈ 90 * 55.79 ≈ 5021.1

So cos(angle KJL) ≈ 4696.38 / 5021.1 ≈ 0.935

Then angle KJL ≈ arccos(0.935) ≈ 20.6 degrees. Wait, but none of the options is close to this. The answer choices are A.30, B.40, C.50, D.60. So this suggests a problem with this approach.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed inconsistencies with the given angles, suggesting that my assumption about the placement might be wrong. Perhaps there's a different way to approach this.

Alternative approach: Since we know angles at L and M, and the sides, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point M or other relations.

Wait, in the parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Let me consider the angles at the vertices.

Let me denote the angles of the parallelogram as follows:

At vertex J: angle KJM (let's call it α)

At vertex K: angle LKM (but need to clarify)

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M.

Given that, and knowing some angles from the problem.

Wait, the given angle MLK is 70 degrees. This is angle at L between M, L, K. In the parallelogram, this would be angle at L. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at L plus angle at K equals 180 degrees. But angle at L is 70 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, angle MLK is not necessarily the entire angle at L. Because MLK is part of the parallelogram's angle at L.

Wait, in the parallelogram, at vertex L, the angle is between sides LM and LK. Which is precisely angle MLK. So angle at L is 70 degrees. Thus, since opposite angles are equal, angle at J is also 70 degrees. But wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle at L is 70 degrees, then angle at K is 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Then angle at J is also 70 degrees, and angle at M is 110 degrees.

But the problem also mentions angle JMK is 30 degrees. Angle JMK is at point M between J, M, K. Let me analyze this.

At point M, the angle of the parallelogram is 110 degrees. This angle is between sides JM and MK. But angle JMK is part of this angle. So angle JMK is 30 degrees, implying that the remaining part of the angle at M is 110 - 30 = 80 degrees. But how does this fit?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle JMK. In triangle JMK, we have angle at M is 30 degrees, and sides JM = 21, MK = ?, JK = 45. Using the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Wait, earlier I tried this and got inconsistent results. Perhaps I need to reconcile this with the angle at L being 70 degrees.

Wait, if angle at L is 70 degrees, then angle at J is also 70 degrees. But the question asks for angle KJL, which is angle at J between K and L. But in the parallelogram, the angle at J is between sides JK and JM. So unless JL is aligned in a particular way, this angle KJL might be related to the angle at J.

Wait, angle KJL is the angle between JK and JL at point J. So it's not the entire angle at J of the parallelogram, but a portion of it. To find this, perhaps we can consider triangle JKL.

But in this case, if angle at J of the parallelogram is 70 degrees, and we're looking for angle between JK and JL, which is part of that angle.

Alternatively, since R is the midpoint of JL, and diagonals bisect each other, maybe there's a relationship between the angles.

Alternatively, since we know the angle at L is 70 degrees, and the parallelogram's angle at J is 70 degrees, and we have some information about the triangle involving angle at M being 30 degrees, perhaps we can use trigonometry to find the desired angle.

Let me try to think of the parallelogram's angles. If angle at L is 70 degrees, then angle at J is 70 degrees. The angle KJL is part of this angle. Let me imagine drawing diagonal JL. This splits the parallelogram into two triangles: JKL and JML.

In triangle JKL, we have angle at J is what we want, angle at L is 70 degrees, and side KL is 21, side JL is diagonal, and side JK is 45.

Wait, but we need more information to find this angle. Perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle JKL.

But to do that, we need to know at least one angle or some side lengths. We know KL = 21, JK = 45, and we can find JL via the parallelogram's diagonal formula.

Earlier, we had the formula for the diagonals: JL² + KM² = 2(JK² + KL²)

But we also can find KM from triangle LKM, where we had KM ≈ 42.65. So JL² = 2*(45² + 21²) - KM² ≈ 2*(2025 + 441) - 1819.62 ≈ 4932 - 1819.62 ≈ 3112.38 → JL ≈ 55.79.

Now, in triangle JKL, with sides JK = 45, KL = 21, JL ≈ 55.79, and angle at L is 70 degrees.

Wait, but angle at L in triangle JKL is still 70 degrees. So using Law of Cosines:

JL² = JK² + KL² - 2*JK*KL*cos(angle at K)

Wait, no. Wait, in triangle JKL, angle at L is 70 degrees. So applying Law of Cosines:

JL² = JK² + KL² - 2*JK*KL*cos(angle at L)

Wait, but JL² is 3112.38, JK = 45, KL = 21, angle at L = 70 degrees.

Let's check:

JK² + KL² = 2025 + 441 = 2466

2*JK*KL*cos(70°) = 2*45*21*cos(70°) ≈ 1890 * 0.3420 ≈ 646.38

So JL² = 2466 - 646.38 = 1819.62 → but earlier calculation gave JL² as 3112.38. This contradicts. So there's a fundamental error here.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption about the angle at L being 70 degrees is incorrect. But the problem states that angle MLK is 70 degrees, which is the angle at L between M, L, K, which is the same as the angle at L in the parallelogram. So this should be correct.

Where is the mistake? Ah, because in triangle JKL, the angle at L is not the same as the angle at L in the parallelogram. Because in the parallelogram, angle at L is between sides LM and LK, which is angle MLK = 70 degrees. But in triangle JKL, the angle at L is between sides KL and JL. So it's a different angle. So my earlier assumption was wrong.

This explains the confusion. So angle at L in the parallelogram is 70 degrees, but in triangle JKL, the angle at L is different. Hence, the previous attempts to apply Law of Cosines in triangle JKL were flawed.

So I need to find a different approach. Let me reconsider.

Since we know the angle at L in the parallelogram is 70 degrees, and we know sides of the parallelogram, perhaps we can find the other angles.

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at L is 70 degrees, then angle at K is 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Similarly, angle at J is 70 degrees, and angle at M is 110 degrees.

Now, the given angle JMK is 30 degrees. This is angle at M between J, M, K. Let me analyze this angle.

At point M, the angle of the parallelogram is 110 degrees. This angle is between sides JM and MK. Angle JMK is part of this angle. So if the total angle at M is 110 degrees, and angle JMK is 30 degrees, then the remaining part of the angle at M is 110 - 30 = 80 degrees. This remaining part would be the angle between MK and the other side at M, which is MS (if there was another side), but in a parallelogram, at point M, the sides are JM and ML. Wait, no. At point M, the sides are JM and ML. Wait, in the parallelogram, the sides at M are JM and ML. So the angle at M is between JM and ML. But angle JMK is between JM and MK. So MK is a diagonal.

So at point M, the angle between JM and MK is 30 degrees, and the angle between MK and ML is 80 degrees. This suggests that triangle JMK has angles at M = 30 degrees, and at J and K.

But how to use this?

Let me focus on triangle JMK. It has sides:

- JM = 21
- MK = ? (diagonal)
- JK = 45
- Angle at M = 30 degrees.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle JMK:

JK² = JM² + MK² - 2*JM*MK*cos(angle at M)

So 45² = 21² + MK² - 2*21*MK*cos(30°)

Let me write this equation:

2025 = 441 + MK² - 42*MK*(√3/2)

Simplify:

2025 - 441 = MK² - 21√3 * MK

1584 = MK² - 21√3 * MK

Rearrange:

MK² - 21√3 * MK - 1584 = 0

This is a quadratic in MK:

Let me denote x = MK.

x² - 21√3 x - 1584 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [21√3 ± sqrt( (21√3)^2 + 4*1584 )]/2

Calculate discriminant:

(21√3)^2 + 4*1584 = 441*3 + 6336 = 1323 + 6336 = 7659

sqrt(7659) ≈ 87.51

So x ≈ [21*1.732 + 87.51]/2 ≈ [36.372 + 87.51]/2 ≈ 123.882/2 ≈ 61.941

So MK ≈ 61.94
