MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of WX given some conditions. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, there are several points mentioned: W, X, Y, Z, D, T. Then there are lines connecting them: m is a line, and there are lines like W,X; W,Z; X,Z; X,Y; Z,Y. Also, there's an angle at Y between X and Z, which is a right angle. Additionally, line (X,Z) is perpendicular to line m. Point Y is the midpoint of line XZ. Also, the length of WZ is 14.9, and the length of WX is equal to the length of WZ. Wait, the question says "Find WX" given that WZ is 14.9. But wait, the last part says Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Z)), 14.9) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), LengthOf(Line(W,Z))). Oh, so if WZ is 14.9, then WX should also be 14.9? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but maybe there's more to it because of the other conditions. Let me check again. The problem mentions that m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ. Since Y is the midpoint of XZ, and m is perpendicular to XZ, that would mean that line m passes through point Y. Because the perpendicular bisector of a segment goes through its midpoint. So line m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ, passing through Y. 

Now, considering that, perhaps there's a relationship between points W, X, Z, and line m. Let me visualize this. Points X and Z form a segment, with Y being the midpoint. Line m is perpendicular to XZ at Y. Now, point W is connected to both X and Z via lines W,X and W,Z. Also, the lengths of WX and WZ are equal. That suggests that point W lies somewhere such that it's equidistant from X and Z. Which would imply that W lies on the perpendicular bisector of XZ. Wait, but the perpendicular bisector of XZ is line m. Therefore, if W is on line m, then WX equals WZ. However, the problem states that line m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ, so if W is on m, then yes, WX=WZ. But does the problem say that W is on line m?

Wait, looking back at the given predicates: There's a Line(m), but the lines listed are Line(W,X), Line(W,Z), etc. So line m isn't directly connected to W unless specified. Wait, but there's a predicate that says Perpendicular(Line(X,Z), Line(m)). So line m is perpendicular to line XZ. And since Y is the midpoint of XZ, then line m must pass through Y. Therefore, line m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ. 

But how does point W relate to line m? Well, the problem doesn't explicitly state that W is on line m. However, if WX equals WZ, then W lies on the perpendicular bisector of XZ. Because the set of points equidistant from X and Z is the perpendicular bisector of XZ. Therefore, W must lie on line m. Hence, W is on line m, making WX equal to WZ. 

Given that, since WZ is 14.9, then WX should also be 14.9. But that would make the answer B, which is 14.9. However, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. Are there any other constraints that could affect this?

Wait, the problem says that Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. Wait, angle at Y between X and Z. Wait, since Y is the midpoint of XZ, and angle XYZ is a right angle. Wait, but if Y is the midpoint of XZ, then XY = YZ. So triangle XYZ has legs XY and YZ, each half of XZ. But angle at Y is a right angle, so triangle XYZ is a right-angled isoceles triangle? Wait, but if angle at Y is right, then XY and YZ are the legs, and XZ is the hypotenuse. So then, XY = YZ, so XZ = XY*sqrt(2). But then, since Y is the midpoint of XZ, then XY = YZ = XZ / 2. Wait, but that would mean XZ = sqrt(2)*XY. Wait, but if angle at Y is right, then by Pythagoras, XZ² = XY² + YZ². But since XY=YZ, then XZ² = 2XY² => XZ = XY√2. But since Y is the midpoint of XZ, XY = XZ/2. So substituting, XZ = (XZ/2) * √2 → XZ = XZ*(√2)/2 → √2/2 = 1, which is not true. Wait, that can't be right. There's a contradiction here. What did I do wrong?

Ah! Wait, if Y is the midpoint of XZ, then XY = YZ = XZ/2. But if angle at Y is right, then triangle XYZ has legs XY and YZ, and hypotenuse XZ. But according to Pythagoras, XZ² = XY² + YZ². Substituting XY = YZ = XZ/2, we get XZ² = 2*(XZ/2)^2 → XZ² = 2*(XZ²/4) → XZ² = XZ²/2 → XZ² - XZ²/2 = 0 → XZ²/2 = 0 → XZ = 0. Which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. That means my assumption is wrong. How come?

Wait, maybe I misread the angle. The Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. Wait, but if points are arranged as X-Y-Z, then angle at Y between X and Z would be angle XYZ. But if Y is the midpoint of XZ, then points X, Y, Z are colinear. So angle XYZ would be a straight line, i.e., 180 degrees, not a right angle. But the problem states that Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. This implies that points X, Y, Z are not colinear. Wait, but Y is the midpoint of XZ, which would require them to be colinear. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, hold on. The predicate says IsMidpointOf(Point(Y), Line(X,Z)). So Y is the midpoint of segment XZ. That means that points X, Y, Z are colinear, with Y between X and Z. But then, angle XYZ would be a straight angle, not a right angle. But the problem says RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z)). Therefore, there's inconsistency here. How is that possible?

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I have misinterpreted the angle. Wait, maybe the angle is not at Y? Wait, the angle is written as Angle(X,Y,Z), which typically denotes the angle at Y between segments XY and YZ. So if Y is the midpoint of XZ, then those segments would be along the same line, making the angle straight. Therefore, the problem seems contradictory. Unless... perhaps there's another configuration where Y is the midpoint of XZ, but the angle at Y is right. How?

Wait, maybe the points aren't colinear? But if Y is the midpoint of XZ, they must be. Wait, unless XZ is not a straight line. No, a segment XZ is a straight line. So Y being the midpoint implies colinearity. Thus, the presence of a right angle at Y contradicts the collinearity. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem's predicates, or perhaps I misunderstood the angle.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not formed by segments XY and YZ, but by different segments. Wait, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y, between points X, Y, Z. So if Y is the midpoint of XZ, then the angle is between XY and YZ, which are parts of the same line. So the angle must be 180°, not 90°. Hence, the given RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,Z)) is conflicting with the IsMidpointOf condition. Therefore, there's an inconsistency in the problem's premises. But since this is a problem presented to solve, perhaps I need to proceed despite this contradiction, assuming that maybe there's a misunderstanding in the way the angle is defined.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between XY and YZ, but between other lines. Wait, but the angle is denoted as Angle(X,Y,Z), which standardly means the angle at Y between X and Z. So this seems unavoidable. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the problem's setup. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the angle is not between XY and YZ, but between other lines. Or perhaps Y is not on segment XZ? But the IsMidpointOf predicate says Y is the midpoint of XZ, implying it's on the segment.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not a straight angle but involves other lines. Wait, but the problem says Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. Given that, perhaps the configuration is not colinear. But how can Y be the midpoint of XZ without being colinear? It's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's description. But since I need to proceed, perhaps I should consider that the angle is not between XY and YZ, but between other lines involving Y. Wait, but the angle is defined as X-Y-Z, which is the angle at Y between X and Z. So this brings us back to the same issue.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely, as it's a standard geometry problem. 

Perhaps the problem has a typo. For instance, maybe the angle is at a different point. Suppose instead of Angle(X,Y,Z), it's Angle(X,T,Z) or something else. But given the problem as stated, I have to work with what's given. 

Assuming that there's a mistake and that the angle is not at Y, but elsewhere, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is between other lines. For example, maybe the angle is between line m and something else. Wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(X,Z), Line(m)), so line m is perpendicular to XZ. And Y is the midpoint of XZ. So line m passes through Y and is perpendicular to XZ. 

So imagine line XZ with midpoint Y, and line m is perpendicular to XZ at Y. Then, point W is connected to X and Z, forming lines WX and WZ. Also, the lengths WX and WZ are equal. So W is equidistant from X and Z, hence lying on the perpendicular bisector of XZ, which is line m. Therefore, W is on line m. 

Therefore, triangle WXZ is isoceles with WX=WZ, and since W is on the perpendicular bisector, which is line m. 

Now, the problem asks for WX, given that WZ is 14.9. Since WX equals WZ, then WX is also 14.9, so answer B. But earlier confusion about the angle seems to suggest a contradiction. But perhaps that's irrelevant. Let me focus on the given data.

The problem gives that WX equals WZ, so regardless of other conditions, if that equality holds, then WX is 14.9. But why was there mention of the right angle and other elements? Perhaps those are red herrings, or maybe they're meant to confirm that W is on line m. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is involved in some other calculation. For example, if we consider triangle WXY or something. But since we don't have info about other sides or angles, maybe it's not necessary. 

Wait, the problem includes the fact that Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. Even though this seems contradictory to Y being midpoint of XZ, maybe it's intended that the angle is between other lines. Wait, if line m is perpendicular to XZ at Y, then maybe the angle at Y between XZ and m is a right angle. But the problem says Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is between lines XY and YZ, but since Y is the midpoint of XZ, these are just parts of the same line. So the angle is straight, not right. Therefore, this seems conflicting. But since the problem states it's a right angle, maybe we should ignore that and proceed with the rest. 

In that case, focusing on the given that WX=WZ=14.9, the answer would be B. But let me verify once more. 

The problem says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,Z)), 14.9) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,X)), LengthOf(Line(W,Z))). Therefore, WX = WZ = 14.9. Therefore, the answer is B. 

But why include all the other information? Maybe to test whether the solver gets confused by the contradictions. For example, if the angle at Y were not a right angle, but the problem says it is. But perhaps that's a distractor. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is used in conjunction with other elements. Let me think: if line m is perpendicular to XZ at Y, then line m is the perpendicular bisector. Point W is on line m, so triangle WXY is a right triangle? Let's see. If W is on line m, then line m is perpendicular to XZ. So if we connect W to X, then triangle WXY would have a right angle at Y? Because line m is perpendicular to XZ. Wait, if Y is on XZ, and line m is perpendicular to XZ at Y, then line m is vertical if XZ is horizontal. So point W is somewhere on line m. Then, connecting W to X would form a triangle. 

But in that case, triangle WXY would have a right angle at Y. Because line m is perpendicular to XZ. So angle at Y between WY and YX is a right angle. But the problem says Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. Which would be angle at Y between X and Z, which is along XZ, so that's a straight line, not a right angle. So this seems conflicting. 

But perhaps the problem's Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to a different angle. Maybe there's a typo, and it should be Angle(X,Y,W)? Or another combination. But given the problem as stated, I have to work with what's given. 

Assuming that the problem is consistent, even with the contradiction, and focusing on the given that WX = WZ =14.9, the answer would be B. However, sometimes problems may have hidden relations. For example, if W is on line m, then maybe triangle WXY is a right triangle, allowing for further calculations. But since WX=WZ, and if we assume that triangle WXY is right-angled at Y, then we could use Pythagoras. 

Let me explore this possibility. Assume that line m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ, so it passes through Y and is perpendicular to XZ. Point W is on line m. So WY is perpendicular to XZ. Then, triangle WXY is right-angled at Y. In this case, WX^2 = WY^2 + XY^2. Similarly, WZ^2 = WY^2 + YZ^2. But since Y is the midpoint of XZ, XY = YZ. Therefore, WX = WZ, which matches the given condition. However, we are told that WZ =14.9, so WX is also 14.9. But this doesn't involve the right angle at XYZ. 

However, the problem states that Angle(X,Y,Z) is a right angle. If this angle is supposed to be the right angle in triangle XYZ, but that's impossible as discussed earlier. Therefore, this suggests that the problem contains conflicting information. However, since the question is solvable, perhaps the right angle is not between X, Y, Z, but between other lines. For example, maybe the right angle is between line m and something else. 

But given the time I've spent and the lack of progress resolving the contradiction, I'll proceed with the given that WX=WZ=14.9, leading to answer B. Hence, Final Answer: B.
