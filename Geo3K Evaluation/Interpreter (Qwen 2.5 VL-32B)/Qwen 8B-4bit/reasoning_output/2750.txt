D. 252

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the area of the figure given all these predicates. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, I notice there are points labeled A through H. Then there are lines connecting them in order: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH, HA. Also, there are diagonals like AC, BD, CE, DF, EG, FH, GA, HB. That seems like a regular octagon? Wait, but there are also several right angles mentioned. For example, Angle(A,E,C) is a right angle, and similarly for other angles. Also, there are perpendicular lines: EA is perpendicular to AC, BD is perpendicular to CE, etc. Plus, there are parallelograms listed, like Parallelogram(A,B,D,C). Hmm, so maybe it's not just an octagon but has some rectangles or squares?

Wait, the problem mentions RightAngle for certain angles. Let me think about each of those. For instance, Angle(A,E,C) is a right angle. Since E is connected to A and C, and we have lines EA and AC being perpendicular. Similarly, other angles are right angles. Also, the lines are congruent. All the lines EA, BD, CE, DF, etc., are congruent. Let me check the congruence relations again.

Looking at the Congruent predicates: Line(E,A) is congruent to Line(B,D), which is congruent to Line(C,E), and so on up to Line(H,B). So all these segments are congruent. Given that, and since they're all perpendicular to adjacent ones, perhaps forming squares or rectangles?

Also, the length of Line(E,A) is given as 9 units, and Line(E,C) is 14 units. Wait, but Line(E,C) would be a diagonal? Because E is connected to C via the line EC? But EC isn't directly listed as a line in the initial list. Wait, looking back, the lines are defined as Line(A,B), Line(B,C), ..., Line(H,A), and then additional lines like Line(A,C), Line(B,D), etc. So Line(E,C) is one of those diagonals. 

So, Line(E,A) is 9 units long, and Line(E,C) is 14 units. And since EA is perpendicular to AC, that forms a right triangle EAC. Let me visualize that. Points E, A, and C form a right triangle with legs EA and AC, and hypotenuse EC. Wait, but if EA is perpendicular to AC, then yes, triangle EAC is a right triangle with legs EA=9 and AC=?, and hypotenuse EC=14. 

Using Pythagoras: EA² + AC² = EC² → 9² + AC² = 14² → 81 + AC² = 196 → AC² = 115 → AC = sqrt(115). But wait, is AC a line segment here? Yes, because Line(A,C) is present. But how does this fit into the overall structure?

Now, considering all the congruent lines. Each of these lines EA, BD, CE, DF, etc., are congruent. Since EA is 9 units, then BD is also 9, CE is 9, DF is 9, etc. Wait, but earlier we had EC as part of the right triangle. Wait, EC is congruent to BD, which is congruent to CE? Wait, the congruences are Line(E,A) ≅ Line(B,D) ≅ Line(C,E) ≅ ... So Line(E,A) is congruent to Line(B,D), which is congruent to Line(C,E), etc. So each of those lines is 9 units. Therefore, EC is 9 units. Wait, but earlier I thought EC was 14 units. Wait, no—wait, the LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14. Wait, hold on! There's a conflict here. Let me recheck.

In the given predicates, Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 14). So Line(E,C) is 14 units. However, according to the congruence, Line(C,E) is congruent to others, such as Line(B,D) and Line(E,A). But Line(E,A) is given as 9 units. Wait, this seems conflicting. How can Line(E,C) be 14 if Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A)=9? Unless Line(C,E) refers to something else. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me clarify.

The congruences are Congruent(Line(E,A), Line(B,D)), Congruent(Line(B,D), Line(C,E)), etc. So Line(E,A) ≅ Line(B,D) ≅ Line(C,E) ≅ ... So Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which is 9 units. Therefore, Line(C,E) should be 9 units. But the given LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14. Wait, Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E)? Because a line segment between two points doesn't depend on direction. So Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E). So that implies that Line(C,E) is 14 units, but according to congruence, it's supposed to be 9 units. This contradiction suggests I made a mistake in interpreting the congruences.

Wait, let me go back. The Congruent predicates are:

Congruent(Line(E,A), Line(B,D))

Congruent(Line(B,D), Line(C,E))

Congruent(Line(C,E), Line(D,F))

And so on. So Line(E,A) is congruent to Line(B,D), which is congruent to Line(C,E), etc. Therefore, Line(E,A) is congruent to Line(C,E). But the problem states that the length of Line(E,C) is 14. Wait, but Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so that would mean Line(C,E) is 14. But according to the congruences, Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which is given as 9. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses different line names. Wait, the line from E to A is Line(E,A), which is 9 units. Then Line(C,E) is another line, which is congruent to Line(E,A), hence 9 units. But the problem says LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14. So Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so that's 14 units. Which contradicts the congruence. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe Line(E,C) is not the same as Line(C,E)? No, in standard geometry, the line between two points is the same regardless of order. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the line EC is not the same as Line(C,E)? No, that's not possible. Wait, unless there's a misunderstanding in the way the lines are named. Wait, the line from E to C is Line(E,C), and the line from C to E is Line(C,E), but they refer to the same line segment. Therefore, the length should be the same. Hence, this is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Let me double-check the problem statement. It says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 14). So Line(E,C) is 14. But according to the congruences, Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which is 9. Therefore, Line(C,E) is 9. But Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so that would imply 14=9, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe Line(E,C) is a different line? Wait, looking back, the lines listed are:

Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,A)

Then additional lines:

Line(A,C), Line(B,D), Line(C,E), Line(D,F), Line(E,G), Line(F,H), Line(G,A), Line(H,B)

Ah! So Line(E,C) is one of the additional lines. Wait, but in the initial list, the main lines are the sides of an octagon: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH, HA. Then the additional lines are diagonals: AC, BD, CE, DF, EG, FH, GA, HB. So Line(E,C) is the diagonal from E to C. So that's different from Line(C,E), which is the same line. Wait, no—if you have Line(E,C), it's the same as Line(C,E). So why is its length 14? But according to the congruences, Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which is 9. So that's conflicting.

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting the congruences. Let me check again the congruences:

Congruent(Line(E,A), Line(B,D))

Congruent(Line(B,D), Line(C,E))

Congruent(Line(C,E), Line(D,F))

Congruent(Line(D,F), Line(E,G))

Congruent(Line(E,G), Line(F,H))

Congruent(Line(F,H), Line(G,A))

Congruent(Line(G,A), Line(H,B))

Therefore, Line(E,A) ≅ Line(B,D) ≅ Line(C,E) ≅ ... So Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which is 9. But Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so that would imply that Line(E,C) is 9. However, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless Line(E,C) is not referring to the same line as Line(C,E). But that can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe Line(E,C) is not the same as Line(C,E)? For example, if Line(E,C) is a different line, but that doesn't make sense. In standard terms, the line between E and C is unique. So this inconsistency is confusing. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or maybe I need to reinterpret the congruences differently.

Wait, maybe Line(E,A) is not the same as Line(C,E)? Wait, Line(E,A) is from E to A, while Line(C,E) is from C to E. These are different lines, even though they share point E. So Line(E,A) is a different line than Line(C,E). Oh! Wait, that's possible. I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I assumed that Line(E,A) and Line(C,E) were the same line, but actually, they are different lines. Let me clarify.

Each line is uniquely identified by its endpoints. So Line(E,A) is the line connecting points E and A. Line(C,E) is the line connecting points C and E. These are two different lines, even though they share point E. Therefore, their lengths can differ. Therefore, the congruence between Line(E,A) and Line(C,E) means that the length of Line(E,A) equals the length of Line(C,E). So Line(E,A) is 9 units (given), so Line(C,E) is also 9 units. But the problem says that LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14. Wait, Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so that would imply that Line(C,E) is 14. But according to the congruence, it should be 9. Again, contradiction.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the lines are defined. Let me check again the problem's given lines. The lines include Line(E,C), which is one of the diagonals. The congruences involve Line(C,E), which is the same as Line(E,C). Wait, no. Wait, Line(C,E) is the same as Line(E,C). So if the problem says that Line(E,C) is 14, and Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A) which is 9, then there's a contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the problem has an error. But assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the line EC is not the same as Line(C,E)? No, that's not possible. Unless the line EC is referring to a different entity. Wait, perhaps the line EC is not a straight line but something else? No, all lines are straight. Therefore, this contradiction remains. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different notations. Like, Line(E,C) could be a vector or something else, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the line EC is a different type of line, but no, the problem lists Line(E,C) as a line.

Given this confusion, perhaps I need to proceed despite the contradiction. Let me assume that the given LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 14, and that the congruence applies to other lines. So, for example, Line(E,A) is 9, Line(B,D) is 9, Line(C,E) is 9, etc. But Line(E,C) is 14. So there's a discrepancy here. However, maybe the line EC is not among the congruent lines? Wait, the congruences are between Line(E,A) and Line(B,D), then Line(B,D) and Line(C,E), etc. So Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A). Therefore, Line(C,E) is 9, so Line(E,C) is 9. But the problem says it's 14. Therefore, this is a problem. 

Perhaps the issue is that Line(E,C) is not one of the congruent lines? Wait, the congruences are between Line(E,A), Line(B,D), Line(C,E), Line(D,F), etc. So Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), so Line(C,E) is 9. But Line(E,C) is the same as Line(C,E), so it should be 9. But the problem says it's 14. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

Unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem's wording. Let me read again the given predicates. One of them is Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 14). Another set is Congruent(Line(E,A), Line(B,D)), etc. So Line(E,A) is 9, and Line(B,D) is 9, and Line(C,E) is 9, etc. But Line(E,C) is given as 14. Therefore, this suggests that Line(E,C) is a different line from Line(C,E). But that's not possible. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to work with it, maybe I need to ignore the congruence and use the given length. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Line(E,C) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which would be 14, and Line(E,A) is one leg (9), and the other leg is AC. Then AC can be found using Pythagoras. Let's try that approach.

Assuming Triangle(E,A,C) is a right triangle with right angle at A. Wait, the given RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)). So the angle at E is a right angle? Wait, Angle(A,E,C) is the angle at point E between points A, E, C. So the angle at E between EA and EC is a right angle. Therefore, triangle EAC is a right triangle with right angle at E. Therefore, EA and EC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but the problem says that Line(E,C) is 14. So EC is one leg (14 units), and EA is another leg (9 units). Therefore, the hypotenuse AC would be sqrt(14² + 9²) = sqrt(196 + 81) = sqrt(277) ≈ 16.64 units. 

But earlier, the congruences said that Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which would imply that EC is congruent to EA, i.e., both 9 units. But the given length of EC is 14. So this seems conflicting. However, if we take the given length of EC as 14 and EA as 9, then we can calculate AC as sqrt(14² +9²). 

But then, how do the congruences play into this? The congruences say that Line(E,A) ≅ Line(B,D) ≅ Line(C,E), etc. So if Line(E,A) is 9, then Line(C,E) should also be 9. But the problem says Line(E,C) is 14, which is the same as Line(C,E). So this is still a contradiction. 

Perhaps the problem intended Line(EC) to be the hypotenuse, and Line(EA) to be one leg, making EC the hypotenuse. Wait, but the RightAngle is at E, so the legs are EA and EC, making AC the hypotenuse. Wait, no. Let me draw this mentally. Point E, connected to A and C. The angle at E between A-E-C is a right angle. So EA and EC are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle EAC has legs EA and EC, with right angle at E. Therefore, AC is the hypotenuse. So EA = 9, EC = 14, so AC = sqrt(9² +14²) = sqrt(81+196) = sqrt(277) ≈ 16.64. 

But if the congruences say that Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A), which would mean EC = EA = 9. But the problem says EC is 14. So this suggests that either the congruence is incorrect, or the given length is wrong. Since the problem gives us the length of Line(E,C) as 14, I'll proceed with that. Maybe the congruence applies to other lines, not EC. 

Let me try to move forward. Assuming that Line(E,A) is 9, Line(E,C) is 14, and they are perpendicular. So AC is sqrt(9² +14²) = sqrt(277). Now, the figure is likely composed of multiple congruent rectangles or squares, given the congruent lines and right angles. 

Since there are parallelograms mentioned, like Parallelogram(A,B,D,C). So ABCD is a parallelogram. Similarly, other parallelograms exist. Let me consider the structure. 

If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Also, since there are right angles, maybe these parallelograms are rectangles. For example, if angle at A is a right angle, then ABCD would be a rectangle. But how do we know that? 

The given RightAngles include Angle(A,E,C), which we've already considered. Other right angles are at B,D,F,G,H,A,B. Wait, the RightAngle predicates are:

RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C))

RightAngle(Angle(B,D,F))

RightAngle(Angle(C,E,G))

RightAngle(Angle(D,F,H))

RightAngle(Angle(E,G,A))

RightAngle(Angle(F,H,B))

Wait, each of these angles is a right angle. For example, Angle(B,D,F) is a right angle, implying that BD is perpendicular to CF? Or more precisely, the angle at D between B-D-F is a right angle. 

Given all these right angles and congruent lines, the entire figure seems to consist of multiple squares or rectangles arranged in a larger pattern. Given that each consecutive pair of lines is perpendicular, and all the lines are congruent, it might form a star-like shape with eight arms, each arm being a line of length 9, and each adjacent pair forming right angles. 

However, the presence of the parallelograms suggests that the figure has repeated structures. For instance, Parallelogram(A,B,D,C) implies that AB is parallel to DC and AD is parallel to BC. Given the right angles, this would make ABCD a rectangle. Similarly, other parallelograms would be rectangles. 

Now, considering the entire figure, it might be a combination of rectangles and right triangles. Let's try to break it down. Starting with the triangle EAC, which is a right triangle with legs 9 and 14. If we can find the area of this triangle and multiply by some factor, maybe we can get the total area. 

But how does this relate to the rest of the figure? The problem involves multiple congruent segments and right angles. Given the congruence of all those lines (EA, BD, CE, DF, etc.), each of length 9, except for EC, which is 14. But this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the entire figure is made up of multiple right triangles and rectangles. For example, each right triangle like EAC, BDF, CGE, DFG, etc., and the rectangles formed by the parallelograms. 

Wait, but the figure includes multiple parallelograms, which are rectangles due to the right angles. So each parallelogram is a rectangle. Let's consider the area contributed by each rectangle. 

For example, Parallelogram(A,B,D,C) is a rectangle with sides AB and AD. But AB is one of the congruent lines (since Line(E,A) is congruent to Line(B,D), etc.). Wait, AB is part of the main octagon's side. But Line(B,D) is a diagonal. So AB is a side of the octagon, and BD is a diagonal. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the area contributions. 

Starting with triangle EAC, which has area (9*14)/2 = 63. If this is one of many such triangles, maybe the total area is a multiple of 63. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 63, and C is 126, D is 252. So if there are two such triangles, the area would be 126 (option C), three would give 189, etc. 

But how many such triangles are there? Let's see. The right angles are at various points: A,E,C; B,D,F; C,E,G; D,F,H; E,G,A; F,H,B. So six right angles in total. Each corresponds to a right triangle. For example, Angle(A,E,C) gives triangle EAC, Angle(B,D,F) gives triangle DFB, and so on. Each of these triangles has legs of length 9 and 14? Wait, no. For example, Angle(B,D,F) is a right angle. So the legs would be BD and BF? Or BD and DF? Wait, the angle at D between B-D-F is a right angle. So BD and DF are the legs, and BF is the hypotenuse. 

But BD is congruent to EA, which is 9. DF is congruent to CE, which is... Wait, earlier, Line(C,E) is congruent to Line(E,A) = 9. But Line(E,C) is 14. So DF is congruent to CE, which would be 9? Or is DF congruent to something else? 

The congruences are Congruent(Line(E,A), Line(B,D)), Congruent(Line(B,D), Line(C,E)), etc. So Line(B,D) is congruent to Line(C,E), which is congruent to Line(E,A), etc. So Line(B,D) is 9, Line(C,E) is 9. Therefore, DF is congruent to Line(E,G), which is congruent to Line(E,A) = 9. So DF is 9. Therefore, in triangle DFB, which has right angle at D, legs BD=9 and DF=9, so area is (9*9)/2 = 40.5. 

Similarly, each of these right triangles would have legs of 9 and 9, giving area 40.5. But there's also the triangle EAC with legs 9 and 14, area 63. So why is that triangle different? Because in that case, one leg is 9 (EA) and the other is 14 (EC). 

So there are six right triangles: 
1. EAC: legs 9 and 14
2. DFB: legs 9 and 9
3. CGE: legs 9 and 9
4. DFG: legs 9 and 9?
Wait, no. Let me list all the right angles and corresponding triangles:

RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)): Triangle EAC, legs EA=9, EC=14
RightAngle(Angle(B,D,F)): Triangle BDF, legs BD=9, DF=9
RightAngle(Angle(C,E,G)): Triangle EGC, legs EC=9, EG=9
RightAngle(Angle(D,F,H)): Triangle DFH, legs DF=9, FH=9
RightAngle(Angle(E,G,A)): Triangle GAE, legs EG=9, GA=9
RightAngle(Angle(F,H,B)): Triangle HBF, legs FH=9, HB=9

Wait, but earlier, EC is 14, but according to congruences, EC should be 9. So there's inconsistency here. But if we accept the given length of EC as 14, then triangle EAC has area 63, and the other five triangles have area 40.5 each. Total area would be 63 + 5*40.5 = 63 + 202.5 = 265.5. None of the answer choices match this. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are not all distinct. For example, maybe each of the six right angles corresponds to a triangle with legs 9 and 9, except one. But then why is EC 14? 

Alternatively, maybe there are multiple such triangles. For example, if each of the six right angles forms a triangle with legs 9 and 9, then total area would be 6*(9*9)/2 = 6*40.5 = 243. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if there are two triangles with legs 9 and 14, and four with legs 9 and 9: 2*63 + 4*40.5 = 126 + 162 = 288. Not helpful. 

Another approach: Since the figure consists of multiple parallelograms (which are rectangles), and each parallelogram has area base * height. For example, Parallelogram(A,B,D,C) is a rectangle with sides AB and AD. But AB is a side of the octagon, and AD is a diagonal. Wait, but without knowing the lengths of AB or AD, it's hard to compute. 

But we know that all the congruent lines are 9 units. For example, Line(E,A) is 9, Line(B,D) is 9, etc. So AB is part of the octagon's side. If the octagon is regular, but since there are right angles, it's not regular. 

Alternatively, since each of the congruent lines is 9, and they are perpendicular to each other, the figure might resemble a 3D cube net unfolded, but that's speculative. 

Wait, going back to the first idea: if triangle EAC has area 63, and there are other triangles contributing. Suppose the total area is twice that, 126, which is option C. Or triple, 189. But without knowing how many such triangles, it's tricky. 

But given the answer choices, option B is 63, which matches the area of triangle EAC. Option C is 126, which is double. If there are two such triangles, that would make sense. But why would there be two?

Alternatively, the entire figure could be composed of multiple such triangles. For instance, if the figure is made of eight right triangles, each with area 63, but that would give 504, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe the figure is a large square made up of smaller parts. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. 

Let me try to consider the parallelograms. Each parallelogram is a rectangle. For example, Parallelogram(A,B,D,C) is a rectangle with sides AB and AD. If AB is 9 units (as part of the congruent lines?), but I don't know. 

Alternatively, since each of the lines EA, BD, CE, DF, etc., are 9 units, and they are perpendicular to adjacent lines, the figure could be constructed by extending these lines to form rectangles. 

For instance, starting with EA=9 perpendicular to AC=14. But how? 

Maybe the entire figure is a combination of rectangles and right triangles, where each rectangle has sides 9 and 14. For example, the rectangle formed by points A, B, C, D. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple congruent lines and right angles, the area could be computed using the formula for the area of a polygon with perpendicular sides. But without knowing the coordinates of the points, this is challenging. 

Another idea: Since there are eight congruent lines of length 9, each perpendicular to the next, forming a closed figure. This resembles an octagon with alternating sides of length 9 and other lengths, but since there are right angles, it might form a star-like shape with eight points. 

Alternatively, think of the figure as having eight right triangles, each with legs 9 and 9, totaling 8*40.5 = 324. Still not matching the options. 

But given that one of the triangles has area 63, and the options include 63, maybe the figure's area is 63. But why? 

Wait, the problem says Shape(ShadedRegion) and Shaded(Shape(ShadedRegion)). So perhaps the shaded region is one of these triangles, like EAC, giving area 63. But why would the shaded region be that specific triangle? 

Alternatively, if the entire figure is a larger shape made up of multiple copies of triangle EAC. For example, if there are two such triangles, total area 126. 

But without more information, it's hard to tell. Given the answer choices and the fact that one of the triangles has area 63, and option B is 63, I might lean towards that. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with side length 14, but that doesn't align with the given data. 

Wait, let's revisit the right triangle EAC. If EA=9, EC=14, then AC=sqrt(9²+14²)=sqrt(277). If the entire figure is built around this triangle, and there are other similar triangles. But I'm stuck. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll make an educated guess. Since one of the triangles has area 63, and that's option B, and the other triangles may contribute additional areas, but if the shaded region is specifically that triangle, then the answer is B. Alternatively, if the entire figure is made up of two such triangles, giving 126 (option C). 

But since the problem mentions "the figure" without specifying which part, and given that the congruence and right angles suggest symmetry, it's possible that the total area is double the area of triangle EAC, leading to 126, option C. 

But earlier calculation suggested that triangle EAC has area 63, and if there are two such triangles, total area would be 126. Hence, option C. 

Alternatively, if the figure comprises multiple rectangles, each with area 9*14=126, but that's just guessing. 

Given that the answer options include 63 and 126, and the presence of one triangle with area 63, I'll choose option B as the answer. But I'm uncertain. Alternatively, if the figure is made of two such triangles, then option C. 

Wait, another approach: since all the congruent lines are 9 units, and each right angle creates a right triangle with legs 9 and 9, giving area 40.5 each. If there are six such triangles, total area is 6*40.5=243, which is not an option. But if one of them has legs 9 and 14, giving 63, and the rest have 40.5, total area would be 63 + 5*40.5 = 63 + 202.5 = 265.5, still not matching. 

Alternatively, the area could be calculated as follows: since each parallelogram is a rectangle, and there are eight parallelograms (from the given predicates), each with sides 9 and 9, giving area 81 each. Total area 8*81=648, which is not an option. 

I think I'm overcomplicating. Given the presence of one right triangle with area 63, and that being one of the answer choices, I'll go with option B. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, if the entire figure is composed of two such triangles, then option C. 

But given the time invested and the options available, I'll settle on option C: 126.
