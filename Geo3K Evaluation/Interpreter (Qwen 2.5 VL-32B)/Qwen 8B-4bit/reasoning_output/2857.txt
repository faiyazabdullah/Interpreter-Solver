MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the structure of the figure. 

So, we have a kite named Kite(F,G,H,J). That means it's a quadrilateral with two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. Also, the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and one of them is the axis of symmetry. But wait, there are also some points and lines mentioned here. Let me note down all the given information.

First, Points F, G, H, J are part of the kite. Then there's point A, which seems important because several lines connect to it. The lines mentioned include Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,J), Line(J,F) forming the kite. So the kite has vertices F, G, H, J connected in order. Then there are other lines: Line(F,A), Line(A,H), Line(G,A), Line(A,J). Also, there are RightAngle predicates at Angle(F,A,H) and Angle(G,A,J). Plus, some length equalities: LengthOf(F,A) is 12, LengthOf(A,H) is 15. Then congruences: Line(F,G) is congruent to Line(G,H), and Line(H,J) is congruent to Line(J,F). Also, Perpendicular between Line(F,G) and Line(H,J). And midpoints: Point A is the midpoint of Line(F,G) and Line(H,J).

Wait, so the kite has two pairs of adjacent equal sides. Since Line(F,G) ≅ Line(G,H) and Line(H,J) ≅ Line(J,F), that suggests that the kite is actually a rhombus? Wait, but a rhombus is a type of kite where all four sides are equal. However, here, the congruence is between adjacent sides. Wait, maybe the kite isn't a rhombus. Let me think again. In a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So if Line(F,G) ≅ Line(G,H) and Line(H,J) ≅ Line(J,F), that would make all four sides equal? Because each pair of adjacent sides is equal. So yes, that would make it a rhombus. But the problem says it's a kite, which could be a rhombus. However, there's more information about point A being the midpoint of FG and HJ. Also, angles at A are right angles.

Let me try to visualize this. The kite has vertices F, G, H, J. The lines FG, GH, HJ, JF form the kite. Now, point A is such that it's the midpoint of FG and HJ. Also, lines FA, AH, GA, AJ are present. Additionally, angles at A: ∠FAH and ∠GAJ are right angles. So, point A is connected to F, G, H, J in a way that creates those right angles. Also, the lengths FA = 12, AH = 15.

Since A is the midpoint of FG and HJ, that tells me that FA = AG and HA = AJ. Wait, because if A is the midpoint of FG, then FA = AG. Similarly, since A is the midpoint of HJ, HA = AJ. Therefore, FA = AG implies that AG = 12. Similarly, HA = AJ = 15. So, the segments FA and AH are given as 12 and 15 respectively.

Now, looking at the right angles. At point A, ∠FAH is a right angle. So triangle FAH is a right triangle with legs FA=12 and AH=15. Therefore, FH would be the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, FH = sqrt(12² + 15²) = sqrt(144 + 225) = sqrt(369). So FH = sqrt(369). But how does this relate to the kite?

But the question asks for GH. Let me recall that in the kite, the sides FG and GH are congruent. Since FG is congruent to GH. Also, since A is the midpoint of FG, FG = 2*FA = 24. Therefore, FG = 24. Hence, GH should also be 24, because they are congruent sides of the kite. Wait, but that would mean GH is 24. But none of the options directly say 24. Wait, the answer choices are A.12, B.15, C.11√3, D.√369. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps GH is not directly FG. Let me check again. The kite has sides FG, GH, HJ, JF. Given that FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. Since FG is congruent to GH, so FG = GH. But FG is 24 (since FA is 12 and A is the midpoint). Therefore, GH = 24. But that's not among the options. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the kite isn't symmetric in the way I thought. Let me re-examine the problem. The kite is defined as Kite(F,G,H,J). So the order of the letters matters. Typically, a kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides. So if the sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF, then FG and GH are adjacent, and HJ and JF are adjacent. Therefore, FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. So FG and GH are congruent, and HJ and JF are congruent. Also, since HJ ≅ JF, and JF is congruent to FG (if HJ is congruent to JF, and JF is same as FG?), no, wait. Wait, the congruences are given as Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). So Line(F,G) ≅ Line(G,H) and Line(H,J) ≅ Line(J,F). Therefore, FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. So FG = GH and HJ = JF. So the kite has two pairs of adjacent sides equal. So FG = GH and HJ = JF. Therefore, the sides FG and GH are equal, HJ and JF are equal. So in total, the kite may have two different side lengths, unless FG = HJ. But since FG and HJ are parts of the kite's sides, but how do they relate?

Also, given that A is the midpoint of FG and HJ. So FG is split into FA and AG, each 12 units. Similarly, HJ is split into HA and AJ, each 15 units. Wait, HA is 15? Because AH is given as 15. Yes, the length of Line(A,H) is 15. So HA = 15. Thus, HJ is split into HA and AJ, each 15. So HJ is 30 units long. Therefore, HJ = 30. But since HJ is congruent to JF, then JF is also 30. Also, FG is 24 (since FA is 12, AG is 12). Therefore, FG = 24, so GH is also 24. But again, 24 is not among the answer choices. So maybe GH is not the length of the side but another segment?

Wait, the question asks to find GH. Wait, GH is one of the sides of the kite. So according to our previous conclusion, GH = FG = 24. But since that's not an option, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to the length of GH as a diagonal or something else? Or perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe GH is not a side but another segment. Wait, the problem mentions Line(F,G), Line(G,H), etc., so GH is a side of the kite. So why isn't 24 an option? Let me check the answer choices again. The options are A.12, B.15, C.11√3, D.√369. So none of these is 24. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: Maybe the kite is not a rhombus. Let me consider that. Suppose that FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF, but FG ≠ HJ. For example, FG = GH = x, and HJ = JF = y. Then, the diagonals of the kite are FH and GJ. Since A is the midpoint of both FG and HJ, which are two of the sides. Let me try to model coordinates. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since A is the midpoint of FG and HJ.

Given that FA = 12, so F is at (-12, 0) and G is at (12, 0), because A is the midpoint. Also, AH = 15. Since A is the midpoint of HJ, then H and J are positioned such that A is halfway between them. But also, angles at A: ∠FAH and ∠GAJ are right angles. So, angle FAH is a right angle, meaning that vectors AF and AH are perpendicular. Similarly, angle GAJ is a right angle, so vectors AG and AJ are perpendicular.

Since AF is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to F(-12,0). Then AH is perpendicular to AF. Since AF is horizontal, AH is vertical. So H lies somewhere along the y-axis. Since AH = 15, then H is at (0,15) or (0,-15). Let's assume H is at (0,15) for simplicity. Similarly, AJ is perpendicular to AG. AG is from A(0,0) to G(12,0), so AG is along positive x-axis. Therefore, AJ is vertical. Since AJ = 15, then J is at (0,15) or (0,-15). Wait, but H is already at (0,15), so J would have to be at (0,-15)? Wait, but A is the midpoint of HJ. If H is at (0,15) and J is at (0,-15), then midpoint is (0,0), which is A. So that works. So J is at (0,-15).

Now, the kite's vertices are F(-12,0), G(12,0), H(0,15), J(0,-15). Wait, connecting F-G-H-J-F. Let me check the sides:

FG is from F(-12,0) to G(12,0): length is 24.

GH is from G(12,0) to H(0,15): distance between (12,0) and (0,15) is sqrt((12)^2 + (15)^2) = sqrt(144+225)=sqrt(369). Similarly, HJ is from H(0,15) to J(0,-15): length is 30. JF is from J(0,-15) to F(-12,0): same as GH, sqrt( (12)^2 + (15)^2 ) = sqrt(369). Wait, but earlier, the congruence was Line(H,J) ≅ Line(J,F). So HJ and JF should be congruent. Here, HJ is 30, JF is sqrt(369) ≈ 19.21... which is not equal. So this contradicts the given congruence. Therefore, my assumption about the position of J is incorrect.

Hmm, this indicates an error in my coordinate setup. Let me rethink. 

Since Line(H,J) is congruent to Line(J,F). So HJ = JF. Earlier, I assumed that HJ was 30, but JF would then need to be 30 as well. So, let me adjust. If HJ = JF = 30. Let me reorient. 

We have H and J such that A is the midpoint of HJ. So, HA = AJ = 15. So H and J are located symmetrically around A. Also, angle GAJ is a right angle. Since AG is from A(0,0) to G(12,0). Therefore, AJ must be perpendicular to AG, so AJ is vertical. Therefore, J is either at (0,15) or (0,-15). Let's take J at (0,15). Then, H is at (0,-15) because A is the midpoint. Wait, but then HJ would be from H(0,-15) to J(0,15), which is length 30. Then JF is from J(0,15) to F(-12,0). What's the length of JF? It's sqrt( (12)^2 + (15)^2 ) = sqrt(369). But HJ is 30, so HJ ≅ JF requires sqrt(369) = 30, which is false. Therefore, this setup doesn't satisfy the congruence. 

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means my initial assumption about the placement of J is wrong. Maybe the direction of AJ is not purely vertical. Wait, angle GAJ is a right angle. Since AG is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to G(12,0). Therefore, vector AG is (12,0). The angle GAJ is at point A, so vectors AG and AJ are perpendicular. Therefore, vector AJ must be perpendicular to AG. Since AG is along x-axis, AJ must be along y-axis. So AJ is vertical. Hence, J must lie along the y-axis. So coordinates of J would be (0, b), and since AJ = 15, then distance from A(0,0) to J(0,b) is |b| = 15. So J is at (0,15) or (0,-15). 

But earlier, HJ must be congruent to JF. Let's suppose J is at (0,15). Then H is at (0,-15) because A is midpoint. Then HJ is from H(0,-15) to J(0,15): length 30. Then JF is from J(0,15) to F(-12,0). As before, that length is sqrt( (12)^2 + (15)^2 ). This needs to equal 30. So sqrt(144+225) = sqrt(369) ≈ 19.21 ≠ 30. Not equal. So this is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that my coordinate system assumption is flawed. Perhaps the right angles aren't aligned as I thought. Let me reconsider the configuration. 

Another possibility: Maybe the right angles are not causing the axes to be aligned with the coordinate system as I assumed. For instance, maybe the lines FA and AH are not along axes. Let me try a different approach.

Let me use vectors and coordinates again, but more carefully. Let me define point A at (0,0). Since A is the midpoint of FG and HJ, then:

Coordinates of F and G: Let’s denote F as (x1, y1), G as (x2, y2). Since A is the midpoint of FG, then ( (x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2 ) = (0,0). So x1 + x2 = 0, y1 + y2 = 0. So G is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, for H and J: H is (a, b), J is (-a, -b), since A is midpoint of HJ.

Given that Line(F,A) has length 12. So distance from F to A is 12. Since A is (0,0), then sqrt(x1^2 + y1^2) = 12 → x1² + y1² = 144.

Similarly, Line(A,H) has length 15. Distance from A(0,0) to H(a,b) is 15 → a² + b² = 225.

Also, the angles at A: ∠FAH is a right angle. So vectors AF and AH are perpendicular. Vector AF is F - A = (x1, y1). Vector AH is H - A = (a, b). Their dot product must be zero: x1*a + y1*b = 0.

Similarly, ∠GAJ is a right angle. Vector AG is G - A = (-x1, -y1). Vector AJ is J - A = (-a, -b). Their dot product must be zero: (-x1)(-a) + (-y1)(-b) = x1*a + y1*b = 0. Which is the same condition as before. So this gives us x1a + y1b = 0.

Now, we also know that Line(F,G) is congruent to Line(G,H). So the length of FG equals the length of GH.

Compute length of FG: distance between F(x1,y1) and G(-x1,-y1) is sqrt[ (-x1 -x1)^2 + (-y1 - y1)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2x1)^2 + (-2y1)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(x1² + y1²) = 2*12 = 24.

Length of GH: distance between G(-x1,-y1) and H(a,b). So sqrt[(a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2]. This must equal 24.

So equation: (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2 = 24² = 576.

Additionally, Line(H,J) is congruent to Line(J,F). Length of HJ is distance between H(a,b) and J(-a,-b): sqrt[(-a -a)^2 + (-b -b)^2] = sqrt[(-2a)^2 + (-2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²) = 2*15 = 30.

Length of JF: distance between J(-a,-b) and F(x1,y1): sqrt[(x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2]. This must equal 30.

Thus, (x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2 = 30² = 900.

So now, we have two equations:

1. (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2 = 576 (from GH)
2. (x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2 = 900 (from JF)

Wait, this is impossible unless 576 = 900, which they aren't. Contradiction. This suggests a fundamental flaw in assumptions. How can these lengths be equal?

Ah! Wait, the congruence is between Line(H,J) and Line(J,F). So HJ ≅ JF. We just computed HJ as 30 and JF as sqrt(...). But according to the above, HJ is 30, and JF must be 30. But our calculation shows that JF squared is (x1+a)^2 + (y1+b)^2 = 900. So (x1+a)^2 + (y1+b)^2 = 900. Also, from GH, we had (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2 = 576. But that would imply 576 = 900, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the congruences. The given is Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). So FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. So FG = GH = 24, HJ = JF = 30. But in that case, how does GH relate to the rest?

From above, GH length is sqrt[(a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2] = 24. But also, JF is sqrt[(x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2] = 30. So unless these are two different expressions, which they are not—they're the same expression. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, there must be an error in the setup.

Perhaps the issue is that the lines FG and GH are congruent, but the way they're defined depends on the coordinates. Let me see. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating GH. Let me recalculate GH.

Point G is (-x1, -y1), point H is (a, b). So GH vector is (a - (-x1), b - (-y1)) = (a + x1, b + y1). So the length squared is (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2. Which is the same as the JF length squared. So this suggests that GH and JF have the same length. But according to the congruence, HJ ≅ JF, so JF = HJ = 30. Therefore, GH must equal FG = 24. So GH = 24, and JF = 30. But according to the equation, GH length squared is (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2 = 24^2 = 576, while JF length squared is same value, implying JF = 24, but it should be 30. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given conditions. But since the problem exists, there must be a resolution. Where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the congruence is between Line(F,G) and Line(H,J)? No, the given congruence is Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). So FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. 

Maybe the problem is that the kite is not convex? Or perhaps I'm missing another relationship. Let me revisit the perpendicularity. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(F,G), Line(H,J)). So lines FG and HJ are perpendicular. 

In our coordinate setup, Line(F,G) is from F(x1,y1) to G(-x1,-y1). The slope of FG is [ -y1 - y1 ] / [ -x1 - x1 ] = (-2y1)/(-2x1) = y1/x1. Line(H,J) is from H(a,b) to J(-a,-b). Its slope is [-b - b]/[-a -a] = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a. These two lines are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes should be -1. Thus:

(y1/x1)*(b/a) = -1 → y1*b = -x1*a.

But from earlier, we had x1*a + y1*b = 0, which is the same as y1*b = -x1*a. So this condition holds. So this is consistent.

So we have that y1*b = -x1*a.

Now, back to the equations:

From GH length: (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2 = 24^2 = 576.

From JF length: same expression equals 30^2 = 900. But this is impossible. Hence, there's inconsistency. This suggests that the given conditions are conflicting, but since the problem is posed, there must be a way to resolve this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the congruence. Let me double-check. The problem states Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). So FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. So FG = GH = 24, and HJ = JF = 30. But in the coordinate setup, GH is the same as JF, so GH = JF. But GH = 24 and JF = 30. So 24 = 30? No. So contradiction.

This suggests that there's a miscalculation in the length of GH. Let me recheck. GH is from G(-x1,-y1) to H(a,b). The distance squared is (a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2. But earlier, I said this equals 24^2, but why? Because FG is 24, and FG ≅ GH. So GH = FG = 24. But if HJ = 30, and HJ is from H(a,b) to J(-a,-b), which is 2*sqrt(a² + b²) = 2*15 = 30. Correct. So JF is from J(-a,-b) to F(x1,y1). Which has distance squared (x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2. This should be equal to HJ's length squared, which is 900. But GH is from G(-x1,-y1) to H(a,b), which is the same distance as JF. So GH = JF = 30. But earlier, I thought GH = FG = 24. This is the mistake!

Wait, FG is congruent to GH. So FG = GH. FG is 24, so GH is also 24. But JF is congruent to HJ, which is 30. So JF = 30. But GH is also supposed to be 24. So GH = 24, JF = 30. But in our calculation, GH and JF are the same distance. Hence, this implies that 24 = 30, which is impossible. So there's a contradiction.

This suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent, but since the problem is solvable, I must have misunderstood something. Let me go back to basics.

Maybe the kite is not defined in the standard way. Maybe the sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF, but the congruence is between FG and HJ, and GH and JF? Wait, the problem says Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). So FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. So FG = GH and HJ = JF. So it's a kite with two pairs of adjacent equal sides. So FG = GH and HJ = JF. But in this case, FG and HJ are not necessarily equal. So the kite could have two different side lengths.

But in the coordinate setup, we have FG = 24, GH = 24, HJ = 30, JF = 30. So it's a kite with two pairs of equal sides: 24 and 30. So it's a valid kite. But then why is there a contradiction in the calculation of GH and JF?

Because GH is from G to H, which is sqrt[(a + x1)^2 + (b + y1)^2], and JF is from J to F, which is sqrt[(x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2]. These are the same, so GH = JF. Hence, GH = JF = 30, but FG = GH = 24. This would require 24 = 30, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's a flaw in the assumptions. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. Let me read the given predicates again: 

"Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H))" and "Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F))". So yes, FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. 

But in this case, GH = JF, and FG = GH. So FG = GH = JF, and HJ = JF. So FG = GH = JF = HJ. So all sides are equal, making it a rhombus. But earlier, we found that FG = 24, HJ = 30. Contradiction again. 

Wait, if it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So FG = GH = HJ = JF. But in our case, FG = 24, HJ = 30. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's a miscalculation in determining the length of HJ. Let me recheck. HJ is from H(a,b) to J(-a,-b). The length is sqrt[( -a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2] = sqrt[(-2a)^2 + (-2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). Since AH = 15, and A is midpoint of HJ, then AH = 15 implies that the distance from A to H is 15, so sqrt(a² + b²) = 15. Hence, HJ = 2*15 = 30. Correct. 

So HJ = 30. And JF = HJ = 30. But JF is from J(-a,-b) to F(x1,y1). Which has length sqrt[(x1 + a)^2 + (y1 + b)^2] = 30. 

Meanwhile, GH is from G(-x1,-y1) to H(a,b), which has the same length as JF, hence 30. But FG is from F(x1,y1) to G(-x1,-y1), length 24. But FG ≅ GH, so GH should be 24. Hence, 24 = 30. Contradiction. 

This suggests that the problem's given conditions are inconsistent, but since it's a problem to solve, there must be a different interpretation. Perhaps the congruence is not between the entire lines but something else? No, the predicate is Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)), which means the lengths are equal. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the length of FG. Let me recheck. FG is from F(x1,y1) to G(-x1,-y1). The distance is sqrt[(-x1 - x1)^2 + (-y1 - y1)^2] = sqrt[(-2x1)^2 + (-2y1)^2] = 2*sqrt(x1² + y1²). Since FA is 12, and FA is the distance from F to A, which is sqrt(x1² + y1²) = 12. Hence, FG = 2*12 = 24. Correct.

So FG = 24, GH = 30, HJ = 30, JF = 30. But FG ≅ GH requires GH = 24. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's no solution under the given conditions, but since it's a problem, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try another approach.

Let me forget coordinates and focus on the given information. We have a kite with FG ≅ GH and HJ ≅ JF. A is the midpoint of FG and HJ. FA = 12, AH = 15. Angles at A are right angles. 

Since A is the midpoint of FG, FA = AG = 12. So FG = 24. Since A is the midpoint of HJ, AH = AJ = 15, so HJ = 30. 

Now, since ∠FAH is a right angle, triangle FAH is a right triangle with legs FA = 12 and AH = 15. Hence, FH = sqrt(12² + 15²) = sqrt(369). 

But FH is a diagonal of the kite. In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Also, the diagonals intersect at right angles. But in this case, we have FH as one diagonal, and the other diagonal is GJ. 

But we also have the perpendicularity between FG and HJ. Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(F,G), Line(H,J)). So lines FG and HJ are perpendicular. 

Let me consider the diagonals of the kite. In a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But here, since FG and HJ are perpendicular, and A is the midpoint of both FG and HJ, this suggests that the diagonals are FG and HJ, and they are perpendicular. Wait, but in a standard kite, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus or a square. Wait, no—actually, in a kite, one of the diagonals is the perpendicular bisector of the other. So if FG and HJ are perpendicular, and A is the midpoint of both, then FG and HJ are the diagonals of the kite. 

Wait, but in a kite, the diagonals are the ones connecting opposite vertices. So if the kite is F, G, H, J, then the diagonals would be FH and GJ. But in this case, the lines FG and HJ are sides of the kite, not diagonals. However, the predicate says that these lines are perpendicular. So FG ⊥ HJ. 

So, the sides FG and HJ are perpendicular. 

Now, let's consider the diagonals. In a kite, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus. But here, we have FG ⊥ HJ, which are sides, not diagonals. 

Let me try to calculate the length of GH. Since FG = 24, and GH is congruent to FG, so GH = 24. But this is not in the options. 

Wait, but maybe GH is not a side but a diagonal? No, GH is a side. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the length of GH, which is 24, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's another way. 

Wait, let me calculate GH using the right triangle. Since FH = sqrt(369), and in the kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall that in a kite, the area is (d1*d2)/2. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. But how does this help?

Alternatively, since we have the diagonals FH and GJ, and they are perpendicular. Let me compute their lengths. FH is sqrt(369), as computed. What about GJ?

Point G is such that A is the midpoint of FG. Since FG = 24, and A is midpoint, so AG = 12. Also, A is the midpoint of HJ, so HJ = 30. 

But how to find GJ? GJ connects G to J. Let me consider coordinates again. Let me assume A is at (0,0). F is (-12,0), G is (12,0). H is (0,15), J is (0,-15). But then FG is from (-12,0) to (12,0), which is horizontal. HJ is from (0,15) to (0,-15), which is vertical. They are perpendicular. 

Now, GH is from G(12,0) to H(0,15). Length is sqrt(12² + 15²) = sqrt(369). 

But in this setup, GH is sqrt(369), which is option D. So the answer would be D. 

Wait, but earlier, I thought FG ≅ GH, which would mean GH = 24. But in this coordinate setup, GH is sqrt(369). Why is there a discrepancy? Because in this setup, FG is 24, GH is sqrt(369), and HJ is 30, JF is sqrt(369). So FG ≅ GH? No, because 24 ≠ sqrt(369). But the problem states that Line(F,G) is congruent to Line(G,H). So this setup violates that condition. 

However, the problem includes the predicate Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)), so FG must equal GH. In this case, it's not satisfied. So this suggests that my coordinate setup is invalid. 

But if I force FG = GH, then what happens? Let me set FG = GH = 24. So GH = 24. In this case, with F(-12,0), G(12,0), and H somewhere such that GH = 24. Let me find H. 

Point G is (12,0). Point H is such that distance from G to H is 24, and from A(0,0) to H is 15. Let me set up equations. Let H be (x,y). Then:

Distance from A to H: x² + y² = 15² = 225.

Distance from G(12,0) to H(x,y): (x-12)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 24^2 = 576.

Expand second equation: x² - 24x + 144 + y² = 576.

But x² + y² = 225, so substitute:

225 - 24x + 144 = 576 → 369 - 24x = 576 → -24x = 207 → x = -8.625.

Then, x = -8.625. Let's compute y² = 225 - x² = 225 - (74.390625) = 150.609375. So y = ±sqrt(150.609375). This is possible, but it complicates things. 

Now, with H at (-8.625, y), and J being such that A is midpoint of HJ. So J is (-x, -y) = (8.625, -y). 

Now, check if lines FG and HJ are perpendicular. FG is from F(-12,0) to G(12,0), which is horizontal. HJ is from H(-8.625, y) to J(8.625, -y). The slope of HJ is [ -y - y ] / [8.625 - (-8.625)] = (-2y)/(17.25). For FG and HJ to be perpendicular, the slope of HJ should be undefined (vertical) or zero (horizontal). But FG is horizontal, so HJ must be vertical. So slope of HJ must be infinite, which would require denominator zero. But 8.625 - (-8.625) = 17.25 ≠ 0. Hence, not vertical. So this setup does not satisfy the perpendicularity. Hence, contradiction again.

This indicates that satisfying all the given conditions is challenging. Perhaps the key is to realize that GH is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by FA and AH, which is sqrt(12² + 15²) = sqrt(369), which is option D. Even though earlier thoughts suggested otherwise, perhaps the problem is designed this way, ignoring the congruence condition. But why?

Wait, the problem states that Line(F,G) is congruent to Line(G,H). If in this scenario, GH is sqrt(369), and FG is 24, then they are not congruent. But maybe there's another way to interpret the congruence. 

Alternatively, perhaps the congruence is between Line(F,G) and Line(H,J). But the problem says Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(G,H)) and Congruent(Line(H,J), Line(J,F)). 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the fact that the only plausible answer matching the given data is D.√369, which is the length of FH, and possibly GH is meant to be this value, even though it conflicts with the congruence. Given the answer choices, D is the only one that fits with the right triangle calculation. Hence, I'll choose D.
