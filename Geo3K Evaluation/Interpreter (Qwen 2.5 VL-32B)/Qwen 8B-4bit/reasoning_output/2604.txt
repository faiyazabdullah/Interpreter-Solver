MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have Triangle(A, B, C). That means points A, B, and C form a triangle. Also, Point(A), Point(B), Point(C) confirm that these are individual points. Then there are Line(A,B), Line(B,C), and Line(A,C), which indicate that each pair of points forms a line segment. So, the triangle has sides AB, BC, and AC.

Next, Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B formed by points A, B, and C. The predicate RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) tells us that this angle is a right angle. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at B.

Now, looking at the length equalities. Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 9) means the length of side BC is 9 units. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Sub(x, 3)) implies that the length of AB is x minus 3. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), x) says that the hypotenuse AC has length x. 

Also, PythagoreanTheorem(Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,C)) is applied here. Since it's a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem should hold. In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse would be AC. Therefore, AC² = AB² + BC².

Let me write down the equations based on the given info. Let me denote AB as (x - 3), BC as 9, and AC as x. Applying Pythagoras:

AC² = AB² + BC²  
=> x² = (x - 3)² + 9²  
Expanding (x - 3)² gives x² -6x +9. So substituting back:

x² = x² -6x +9 +81  
Simplify the right-hand side: x² -6x +90

Subtract x² from both sides: 0 = -6x +90  
Then, adding 6x to both sides: 6x = 90  
Divide both sides by 6: x = 15

Wait, so x is 15? Let me check my steps again. Starting with x² = (x-3)^2 + 81. Expanding (x-3)^2 is x² -6x +9. Adding 81 gives x² -6x +90. Subtract x² from both sides leaves 0 = -6x +90. Solving for x gives 6x=90 → x=15. Yes, that seems correct.

Looking at the answer choices, B is 15. So the correct answer should be B.
