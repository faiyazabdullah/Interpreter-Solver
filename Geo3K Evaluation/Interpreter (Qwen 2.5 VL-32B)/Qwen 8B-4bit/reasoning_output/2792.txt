====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 3. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they connect. Let me start by listing out everything given.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then there are several lines connecting these points. For example, Line(B,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A), Line(A,G), Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D). So point A seems connected to multiple other points. Also, some angles are mentioned: Angle(E,B,A) is 63 degrees, Angle(G,A,D) is 136, Angle(B,F,E) is 69, Angle(D,F,C) is 47. There are also congruences between angles 4 and 5. And the question says that m∠4 equals m∠5, so we need to find ∠3.

Wait, but where do angles 3, 4, 5 come into play? The problem mentions IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(3)), IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(4)), IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(5)). So angle 3, 4, 5 all have vertex at F? Or maybe those angles are defined with F as one of their vertices?

Let me think. Each angle has three points, like Angle(X,Y,Z) means the angle at Y between X and Z. So if IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(3)) is true, then angle 3 has vertex at F. Similarly for angles 4 and 5. But the problem states that m∠4 = m∠5, and asks for ∠3. 

So perhaps angles 4 and 5 are two angles at point F, and since they're congruent, maybe they form part of a triangle or something. Wait, looking back, there are triangles involving F. Triangle(B,E,F), Triangle(C,F,D). Also, Point F is connected to E, C, and maybe others via lines. Let me check the lines again. Line(E,F), Line(F,C), so F is connected to E and C. Also, Line(B,E) connects B-E, Line(E,F) connects E-F, so E is connected to B and F. Similarly, Line(F,C) connects F-C, Line(C,D) connects C-D, etc.

Now, considering the angles around point F. Since F is connected to E and C, and maybe other points? Wait, the lines are E-F, F-C, and maybe more? Let me check all lines again. Lines listed are:

Line(B,E)

Line(E,F)

Line(F,C)

Line(C,D)

Line(D,A)

Line(A,G)

Line(A,B)

Line(A,C)

Line(A,D)

So, F is connected to E and C. So point F is part of triangle B-E-F (since it's a triangle) and triangle C-F-D (another triangle). Also, there's a triangle A-C-F? Wait, the Triangle(A,C,F) is mentioned. So point F is connected to A? No, wait, the lines are Line(A,C) and Line(A,F)? Wait, no. Let me check the lines again. The lines given are Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D), Line(A,G). So point A is connected to B, C, D, G. So F is connected to E, C, and maybe others? From the lines, F is connected to E and C. Are there any other connections? Maybe through other triangles?

But focusing on angles. The given angles are:

Angle(E,B,A) = 63° – this is angle at B between E and A.

Angle(G,A,D) = 136° – angle at A between G and D.

Angle(B,F,E) = 69° – angle at F between B and E.

Angle(D,F,C) = 47° – angle at F between D and C.

Also, there's a statement that Congruent(Angle(4), Angle(5)), and IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(3)), same for 4 and 5. So angles 3,4,5 all have vertex at F. Therefore, angle 3, 4, 5 are angles at point F. Now, since angles at a point sum up to 360°, but depending on how many angles are present.

But first, let's consider the angles at point F. We know two angles at F: Angle(B,F,E)=69° and Angle(D,F,C)=47°. Wait, but maybe there are more angles at F. Because the triangles involving F are Triangle(B,E,F), Triangle(C,F,D), and Triangle(A,C,F)? Wait, Triangle(A,C,F) would imply that A is connected to C and F. But according to the lines, Line(A,C) exists, but is there a line from A to F? Looking back at the list of lines: Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D), Line(A,G). So no line directly connecting A to F. However, Triangle(A,C,F) is mentioned as a triangle. That suggests that points A, C, F are connected. But the line from A to F isn't explicitly listed. Wait, but maybe it's implied through the triangle? Hmm, that could be an issue. Alternatively, maybe the line AF is formed through another connection? Or perhaps the triangle is formed via existing lines. Let me think.

Wait, Triangle(A,C,F) implies that there's a line from A to C (which exists), from C to F (exists as Line(C,D) and Line(F,C)), and from F to A. Wait, but there's no explicit line from F to A. Unless it's inferred through the triangle. So maybe there's an implicit line from A to F? But the original problem lists only certain lines. This might be a mistake, but assuming that the triangles are valid, even if the lines aren't explicitly stated. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the line AF is considered as part of another structure. For instance, if there's a line from A to F, but it's not listed in the given lines. However, since the user provided certain lines, perhaps I should stick strictly to them. But the presence of Triangle(A,C,F) suggests that such a triangle exists, so maybe there's an implied line from A to F. Let me proceed under that assumption for now.

So, if there's a triangle ACF, then there's a line AF. Therefore, point F is connected to A. Hence, at point F, there are lines connecting to E, C, and A. Thus, forming angles at F between different pairs.

So, angles at point F would be:

- Between B-F-E: 69° (given)

- Between D-F-C: 47° (given)

Additionally, if there's a line from F to A, then there's another angle at F involving A. Let me check if that's the case. The Triangle(A,C,F) exists, so there's a line from A to C (existing), C to F (existing), and F to A (assumed). Therefore, there's an angle at F between A and C. But wait, the given angles at F are Angle(B,F,E) and Angle(D,F,C). What about other angles?

So, if there's a line from F to A, then we can have angles at F between A and E, between A and C, etc. But the problem mentions angles 3,4,5, each having vertex at F. Given that, and knowing that angles 4 and 5 are congruent.

Wait, the problem states that Congruent(Angle(4), Angle(5)), and IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(3)), same for 4 and 5. So angles 3, 4, 5 all have vertex at F. So angle 3 is at F, as are angles 4 and 5. Since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, their measures are equal.

Now, the question is to find the measure of angle 3, given that angles 4 and 5 are congruent. To find angle 3, we need to find the measure of the remaining angle(s) at point F.

First, let's consider all angles at point F. If there are three angles at F: angle 3, angle 4, angle 5, and possibly others. Wait, but we already have two angles at F: Angle(B,F,E) = 69°, and Angle(D,F,C) = 47°. Are these angles part of angles 3, 4, 5?

Wait, the given angles at F are:

Angle(B,F,E) = 69°, which is between B-F-E.

Angle(D,F,C) = 47°, which is between D-F-C.

But if there's a line from F to A, then there's also an angle between A-F and other lines. For example, if there's a line from F to A, then the angle between A-F and E-F, or between A-F and C-F.

But since the problem refers to angles 3,4,5 as being at F, and angles 4 and 5 are congruent, perhaps angle 3 is one of the angles mentioned earlier, while angles 4 and 5 are other angles.

Alternatively, perhaps angles 4 and 5 are parts of other structures. Let me think again.

Another approach: since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, maybe they are vertical angles, or alternate interior angles, or corresponding angles, or supplementary angles. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to say. However, since they share vertex F, they could be adjacent angles forming a linear pair, or part of a triangle.

Wait, let's consider the triangles involving F. There's Triangle(B,E,F) which includes angle at F: Angle(B,F,E) = 69°, Triangle(C,F,D) with angle at F: Angle(D,F,C) = 47°, and Triangle(A,C,F) with angle at F. So in triangle ACF, the angle at F would be between A-F and C-F. Let me denote that angle as x. Then, in triangle ACF, the sum of angles is 180°, so if we can find other angles in that triangle, we can find x.

But we don't know the other angles in triangle ACF yet. However, maybe there are other relationships.

Alternatively, considering all angles around point F. The total of angles around a point is 360°. So if we can find all angles at F, we can compute the missing ones.

Assuming that there are four angles at point F: the two given angles (69° and 47°), plus angles 3, 4, 5. Wait, but the problem states that angles 3, 4, 5 are at F, and angles 4 and 5 are congruent. So maybe angle 3 is the third angle, and angles 4 and 5 are other angles?

Wait, but how many angles are there at point F? Let's count the number of lines coming out of F. The lines connected to F are:

- From F to E (Line(E,F))

- From F to C (Line(F,C))

- If there's a line from F to A (as per triangle ACF), then that's a third line.

Therefore, three lines from F: E, C, A. So, three lines divide the plane around F into three angles. Wait, but three lines from a single point divide the plane into six angles (if they are not overlapping), but if they are arranged in order, then three angles. Wait, no—if three lines radiate from a point, they divide the plane into three angles. For example, imagine three lines from F going to E, C, and A. Depending on the arrangement, the angles between each pair of lines.

But in reality, the angles around point F would be the angles between each pair of lines. So if there are three lines from F, there are three angles around F. However, the given angles are Angle(B,F,E)=69°, which is between B-F-E. Wait, but B is connected to F via Line(B,E), which connects B to E. So point B is connected to E, which is connected to F. So the angle at F between B-F-E is part of triangle BEF. Similarly, the angle at F between D-F-C is part of triangle DFC.

But if there's a line from F to A, then there would be an angle between A-F and E-F, and between A-F and C-F. Let's suppose that the three lines from F are E, C, and A. So the three angles at F would be:

1. Between E-F and A-F: let's call this angle α.

2. Between A-F and C-F: angle β.

3. Between C-F and E-F: angle γ.

But we already have two angles given: Angle(B,F,E) is 69°, which is between B-F-E. Wait, but B is not directly connected to F. Wait, the line is Line(B,E), so B is connected to E, and E is connected to F. So the angle at F between B-F-E is actually the angle between lines EB and EF. Wait, but EB is a line from E to B, and EF is a line from E to F. Wait, no—the angle at F is between the lines FB and FE? Wait, no. The angle notation is Angle(B,F,E), which is the angle at point F between points B and E. So the angle at F between lines FB and FE. But FB is not a line unless there's a line from F to B. But according to the given lines, the only line involving B is Line(B,E) and Line(A,B). So point B is connected to E and A. So the line from B to E is given, but there is no direct line from F to B. Therefore, the angle at F between B and E would involve the lines connecting F to E and F to B. But if there's no line from F to B, then how is that angle formed?

This seems contradictory. How can there be an angle at F between B and E if there's no line connecting F to B? Unless the angle is formed by extending lines. For example, maybe the angle is formed by the intersection of lines BE and BF, but BF doesn't exist. This is confusing. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the angle at F between B and E is formed by lines that are connected indirectly. Like, if there's a line from B to E, and another line from E to F, then the angle at E between B and F? No, the angle is specified as Angle(B,F,E), which is the angle at F between B and E. So for that angle to exist, there must be lines from F to B and F to E. But according to the given lines, there's a line from E to F (Line(E,F)), but no line from F to B. Therefore, this seems inconsistent. This suggests that maybe the angle is formed by other lines. For example, maybe the line from B to E and the line from F to E intersect at E, but the angle at F is not directly formed. This seems impossible. There's a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe I misread the angle notation. In standard notation, Angle(B,F,E) means the angle at point F between points B and E. So the angle is formed by the lines FB and FE. Therefore, for this angle to exist, there must be a line from F to B. But according to the given lines, there is no such line. Therefore, either there's an error in the problem setup, or I'm missing something.

Looking back at the given lines, Line(A,B) exists, Line(B,E) exists, Line(E,F) exists. So, point B is connected to E, and E is connected to F. Therefore, the lines BE and EF are present. So, the angle at E between B and F would be formed by BE and EF. However, the angle in question is Angle(B,F,E), which is supposed to be at point F. But there's no line from F to B. So this angle cannot exist unless there's an implicit line from F to B. This seems like a critical inconsistency.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by extending lines. For example, if there's a line from B to E and a line from F to E, then the angle at E between B and F. But the angle is supposed to be at F. This is very confusing. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the angle is meant to be at E instead of F? Or maybe the angle is at B? But that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by lines that are not directly connected but are part of other structures. For example, if there's a triangle involving B, F, and another point. But without a direct line from F to B, I can't see how that angle is formed. This seems like a major issue. Perhaps I should assume that there's an implicit line from F to B, allowing the angle at F between B and E. Even though it's not listed in the given lines, maybe it's part of the triangle BEF, implying that there's a line from B to F. Let me proceed with that assumption, because otherwise the given angles don't make sense.

So, assuming that there's a line from B to F, making triangle B-E-F, which would mean that Line(B,F) exists. But in the given lines, the only lines involving B are Line(B,E) and Line(A,B). So adding Line(B,F) would be an implicit line. Let me accept that for the sake of solving the problem.

With that assumption, now at point F, we have three lines: F to B, F to E, and F to C (from Line(F,C)), and possibly F to A (for the triangle ACF). Wait, but earlier I thought there was a line from F to A due to Triangle(A,C,F). Let me confirm.

Triangle(A,C,F) requires sides AC, CF, and AF. Line(A,C) is given, Line(F,C) is given, so AF must be a line. So yes, there's a line from A to F. Therefore, at point F, there are four lines: F to B, F to E, F to C, and F to A. Wait, no—wait, if there are four lines from F, then there are four rays emanating from F, creating multiple angles. But initially, I thought there were three lines: F to E, F to C, F to A. Plus the line from F to B. So four lines from F, leading to multiple angles.

But this complicates things. Let me try to visualize this.

At point F, connected to B, E, C, and A. So four lines from F, dividing the plane into angles. The angles around F would sum to 360 degrees. The given angles are Angle(B,F,E) = 69°, which is between B and E, and Angle(D,F,C) = 47°, which is between D and C. Wait, but D is connected to C via Line(C,D), and Line(D,A). So point D is connected to C and A. But how does D relate to F? The angle at F between D and C would require a line from F to D. But according to the given lines, there's no line from F to D. So again, this suggests an inconsistency. How can there be an angle at F between D and C if there's no line from F to D?

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Rechecking the given lines:

Lines are:

Line(B,E)

Line(E,F)

Line(F,C)

Line(C,D)

Line(D,A)

Line(A,G)

Line(A,B)

Line(A,C)

Line(A,D)

So, F is connected to E and C. D is connected to C and A. B is connected to E and A. A is connected to B, C, D, G. G is connected to A. So, point F is only connected to E and C. So, there are only two lines from F: F-E and F-C. Therefore, only two angles at F? But the problem mentions angles at F involving B, D, and others. This suggests that my previous assumptions about the existence of lines from F to B, A, D are incorrect.

Wait, but the problem mentions Triangle(B,E,F), which would require a line from B to F. But there's no such line in the given list. This is conflicting. Perhaps the problem uses the term 'line' differently, or there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not directly formed by lines but by other means. For example, Angle(B,F,E) could be formed by the lines BE and BF, even if BF isn't explicitly listed. This is possible if BF is considered as part of the triangle BEF, implying its existence.

Given the confusion, maybe I should focus on the angles that are definitely given and see if I can derive relationships from them.

Given that Angle(B,F,E) = 69°, which is likely the angle at F between B and E. Assuming that there is a line from F to B, making this angle possible. Similarly, Angle(D,F,C) = 47° is the angle at F between D and C, which would require a line from F to D. But there's no line from F to D in the given lines. So again, this is problematic.

Perhaps the problem assumes that these angles are formed by extended lines or other connections. For example, Angle(D,F,C) could be formed by extending line CD to meet at F? But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not at F but at another point. Wait, no—the angle notation specifies the middle letter as the vertex. So Angle(D,F,C) is the angle at F between D and C. So this implies a line from F to D and from F to C. But since there's no line from F to D, this is impossible.

This seems like a fundamental flaw in the problem setup. Without the necessary lines, the given angles can't exist. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, I must assume that there's a way to interpret it correctly. Maybe the lines are not just straight lines but include other types of connections, or the angles are formed by other means.

Let me try to ignore the inconsistencies and focus on the given angles and try to find relations.

Suppose that the angle at F between B and E is 69°, and the angle at F between D and C is 47°. These angles might be part of larger angles around F. Additionally, there might be other angles at F from the triangles involving F.

For example, Triangle(B,E,F) has angles at B, E, and F. We know the angle at F is 69°, so the other angles at B and E can be determined if we have more info. Similarly, Triangle(C,F,D) has angle at F of 47°, and other angles at C and D.

But without knowing other angles in those triangles, this might not help directly.

However, the problem mentions that Angles 4 and 5 are congruent, and asks for angle 3. Since angles 3,4,5 are all at F, and angles 4 and 5 are congruent, maybe they are the other angles at F besides the given ones.

Let me assume that the angles at F are:

- Angle(B,F,E) = 69° (given)

- Angle(D,F,C) = 47° (given)

And possibly other angles formed by the lines from F to other points.

But if there are only two lines from F (to E and to C), then there are two angles at F: one between E and C, and the rest of the angles around F. But this doesn't align with the given angles.

Alternatively, if there are more lines from F, like to B and D, then there are more angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Maybe the key lies in the triangles and the angles within them. For example, in Triangle(B,E,F), the angles sum to 180°. We know one angle at F is 69°, so the other two angles at B and E sum to 111°. Similarly, in Triangle(C,F,D), one angle at F is 47°, so the other two angles at C and D sum to 133°.

But without more information about these angles, it's hard to proceed. However, there's also Triangle(A,C,F), which might provide more info. Let's assume that Triangle(A,C,F) has an angle at F, which we'll call x. Then, the sum of angles in this triangle would be 180°, so if we can find other angles, we can find x.

But again, without knowing other angles in this triangle, this might not help directly.

Wait, the problem also gives Angle(G,A,D) = 136°, which is the angle at A between G and D. And there's Line(A,G), Line(A,D), so this angle is formed at A between G and D. This might be part of a larger shape, like a quadrilateral or triangle.

Also, there's Triangle(A,D,G), so points A, D, G form a triangle. The angle at A is 136°, so the other angles at D and G sum to 44°.

But again, without more info, it's unclear.

Let me return to the main question: finding angle 3, given that angles 4 and 5 are congruent and all have vertex at F.

Assuming that at point F, there are multiple angles, and angles 3, 4, 5 are among them. Since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, perhaps they are supplementary or complementary to other angles.

If we consider that the sum of all angles around point F is 360°, and if we know some of them, we can find the others.

But to do that, I need to identify all angles at F. Let's assume that the given angles (69° and 47°) are two of them, and the other angles are 3, 4, and 5. Since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, let's call their measure y. Then, the sum would be:

69 + 47 + y + y + angle3 = 360.

Wait, but this assumes there are five angles at F, which may not be the case. Alternatively, if there are three angles at F: the two given ones and angle 3, but that doesn't account for angles 4 and 5. This suggests that my understanding is still incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe angles 4 and 5 are parts of the given angles. For example, angle 4 and 5 could be the 69° and 47°, but that contradicts the fact that they are congruent. Since 69 ≠ 47, this is impossible.

Alternatively, angle 3 is the sum of 69 and 47, but that would be 116°, which is one of the options. Let me check the options: A. 116, B. 126, C. 136, D. 146.

If angle 3 is 116°, then that would be option A. But why would that be the case? If the sum of the given angles (69 + 47 = 116) is angle 3, but that assumes that those two angles are adjacent and form angle 3. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if angles 4 and 5 are the supplements of the given angles. For example, if angle 4 and 5 are supplementary to 69° and 47°, respectively. But since they are congruent, that would mean 69 = 47, which is false.

Another possibility: the angles at F are part of a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle involving F and two other points, with angles 3, 4, 5. But without knowing which triangle, it's hard to say.

Wait, let's consider the triangles involving F:

- Triangle(B,E,F): angle at F is 69°, angles at B and E sum to 111°.

- Triangle(C,F,D): angle at F is 47°, angles at C and D sum to 133°.

- Triangle(A,C,F): angle at F is some value, say x, and other angles sum to 180 - x.

If there's another triangle involving F and A, like Triangle(A,F,G)? Not sure.

But if we look at the line from A to G and A to D, and the angle at A between G and D is 136°, which might relate to other angles.

Alternatively, considering the entire diagram, maybe there's a polygon or multiple polygons, and the angles at F contribute to the overall structure.

But this is too vague. Let me try another approach.

Since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, and they're at F, perhaps they are vertical angles or alternate interior angles. If they are vertical angles, they are equal by definition. But without knowing their positions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if angles 4 and 5 are part of a transversal or something. But again, without a diagram, it's difficult.

Wait, the problem mentions that IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(3)), IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(4)), IsVertexOf(Point(F), Angle(5)). So each of these angles has vertex at F. So angle 3, 4, and 5 are all at F. And angles 4 and 5 are congruent.

So, at point F, there are three angles: 3, 4, 5. But since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, let's call their measure y. Then, the sum of these three angles would be 360° if they are around point F, but if they are part of a triangle or other figure, the sum would be less. Wait, but if they are around point F, then the sum would be 360°, but if they are part of a triangle, the sum would be 180°.

But how many angles are there at F? If there are three angles at F: 3, 4, 5, and their sum is 360°, then 3 + 4 + 5 = 360. But since 4 = 5, this becomes 3 + 2y = 360. But we don't know y. However, we also know that there are other angles at F from the given angles. For example, Angle(B,F,E) = 69° and Angle(D,F,C) = 47°. These might be parts of the angles 3, 4, 5.

Wait, perhaps angle 3 is composed of 69° and 47°, making it 116°, and angles 4 and 5 are the remaining angles. But this is just guessing.

Alternatively, if the given angles (69° and 47°) are angles 4 and 5, but they are not congruent. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe angle 3 is the supplement of the sum of the given angles. For example, if the sum of the given angles is 69 + 47 = 116°, then angle 3 would be 180 - 116 = 64°, but that's not an option. Or 360 - 116 = 244, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if the given angles are parts of a triangle. For example, if 69° and 47° are two angles in a triangle, then the third angle would be 180 - 69 - 47 = 64°, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should consider the fact that the sum of angles around point F is 360°, and if there are two given angles (69° and 47°) and two congruent angles (angles 4 and 5), then:

69 + 47 + 2y = 360 → 116 + 2y = 360 → 2y = 244 → y = 122. So angle 3 would be one of the given angles, but none of the given angles are 122. Or if angle 3 is the other angle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but this assumes that the given angles (69 and 47) are part of the angles around F, along with angles 3, 4, and 5. If angle 3 is one of the angles, and angles 4 and 5 are the other two, but this is unclear.

Alternatively, if the given angles (69 and 47) are angles 4 and 5, but since they are not congruent, this is invalid. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps angle 3 is the sum of 69° and 47°, giving 116°, which is option A. But why would that be the case? If those two angles are adjacent and form angle 3, then yes. For example, if angle 3 is made up of the 69° and 47° angles next to each other, then angle 3 would be 116°.

But this is assuming that the given angles are adjacent and form angle 3. This might be the case if the diagram has those angles adjacent at point F.

In that scenario, angle 3 would be 69 + 47 = 116°, which is option A. This seems plausible. But how can I justify this?

If the two given angles (at F) are adjacent, forming a larger angle, which is angle 3, then angle 3 would be their sum. And since angles 4 and 5 are congruent, they might be other angles around F. For example, if there are two other angles at F, each equal to y, and the sum of all angles around F is 360°, then:

angle3 + 2y = 360.

But we have two given angles (69 and 47) which are parts of angle3, so angle3 = 69 + 47 = 116°, then 116 + 2y = 360 → 2y = 244 → y = 122°. But the problem states that angles 4 and 5 are congruent, so their measure is 122°. But the question is asking for angle3, which would be 116°, option A.

This seems like a possible solution, and 116 is one of the options. Let me check if this fits with the given data.

Yes, if angle3 is 116°, then the remaining angles around F would each be 122°, which are angles 4 and 5. Since the problem states that angles 4 and 5 are congruent, this fits. Therefore, the answer would be A.

But why would angle3 be the sum of 69 and 47? It depends on the configuration. If the two given angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle, then yes. But how do we know they are adjacent?

Well, since the lines are connected as follows: F is connected to E and C. The angle at F between B and E (69°) would require a line from F to B, and the angle at F between D and C (47°) would require a line from F to D. If these lines (FB and FD) are on opposite sides, then the angles could be adjacent. But this is speculative.

However, given the lack of other information and the presence of option A (116), this seems like the most plausible answer. Hence, I'll go with option A.
