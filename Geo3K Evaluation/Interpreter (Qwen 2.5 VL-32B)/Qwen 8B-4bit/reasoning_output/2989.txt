MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two rhombuses that are similar. The first one, Rhombus(A,B,C,D), has a side length of 40 units and an area of 400 square units. The second rhombus, Rhombus(E,F,G,H), has an area of 64 square units, and we need to find its side length, denoted as x. 

First, I remember that for similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since they're both rhombuses, which are parallelograms with all sides equal, the similarity ratio should directly relate their side lengths and areas.

Let me write down what I know. Let’s denote the side length of the first rhombus as s₁ = 40, and its area as A₁ = 400. For the second rhombus, the side length is x (which we need to find) and its area is A₂ = 64. 

Since they are similar, the ratio of their areas (A₂/A₁) should equal the square of the ratio of their sides (x/s₁). So mathematically, that would be:

A₂ / A₁ = (x / s₁)²

Plugging in the known values:

64 / 400 = (x / 40)²

Simplifying the left side: 64 divided by 400. Let me compute that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 16 gives 4/25. So 4/25 equals (x/40) squared. 

To solve for x, take the square root of both sides:

√(4/25) = x / 40

Which simplifies to 2/5 = x / 40. Then multiplying both sides by 40 gives x = (2/5)*40 = 16. 

Wait, so x is 16? Let me check if that makes sense. The area ratio is 64/400, which reduces to 4/25. Taking the square root gives 2/5, which is 0.4. Multiplying 0.4 by 40 gives 16. That seems right. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 16. So the correct answer should be B. But wait, let me make sure there's no mistake here. 

Another way to think about it: since area scales with the square of the side length, if the area of the smaller rhombus is 64 and the larger is 400, the ratio of areas is 64/400 = 0.16. The square root of 0.16 is 0.4, which is 2/5. Therefore, the side length ratio is 2/5, so x = 40*(2/5) = 16. Yep, same result. 

Therefore, the answer should be B, 16.
