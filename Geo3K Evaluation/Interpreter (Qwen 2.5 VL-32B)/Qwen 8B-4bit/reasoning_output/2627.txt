MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. 

So, we have points R, S, T and a circle B. All three points R, S, T lie on circle B. That means they're all points on the circumference of the same circle. Then there are some angle measures mentioned. The angle at S between R and B is equal to x, and the angle at B between S and T is twice x, so 2x. Also, the sum of these three angles—angle(R,S,B), angle(B,S,T), and angle(T,R,B)—equals 360 degrees. Wait, but angles around a point usually add up to 360, but here it's talking about three angles. Hmm.

Let me visualize this. Points R, S, T are on a circle. Let me think about how these angles are formed. The first angle is Angle(R, S, B). So vertex at S, with sides going to R and B. Similarly, Angle(B, S, T) has vertex at S, with sides going to B and T. Wait, but if all three points are on the circle, maybe S is one of the points? Or wait, B is the circle, so maybe B is the center? Wait, the name of the circle is B. So the circle is named B, so perhaps B is the center? Wait, but the points are R, S, T. So Point(B)? No, the circle is named B. Wait, the predicates say Point(R), Point(S), Point(T), and Circle(B). So the circle is called B, and points R, S, T lie on it. So B is the circle, not a point. So the points are R, S, T on circle B. 

Then, the angles mentioned are Angle(R, S, B). Wait, angle at S between R and B? But B is a circle, not a point. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, looking back at the predicates: 

Wait, the Angle(R, S, B) would be an angle with vertex at S, formed by points R, S, B. But B is a circle, not a point. That seems incorrect. Unless there's a mistake in the predicate names. Maybe B is actually a point? Because otherwise, the angle can't be formed with B being a circle. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mislabeling. Wait, maybe B is a point that's the center of the circle? But the circle is named B. Wait, in standard notation, circles are often labeled with a single letter, like circle O, where O is the center. So maybe B is the center of the circle? But the predicate says Circle(B), implying that B is the circle itself. So perhaps there's confusion here. 

Alternatively, maybe the Angle(R, S, B) refers to an angle with vertex at S, between points R and another point B, which might be a different point. Wait, but the points given are R, S, T. There's no other point named B. Wait, unless B is a point that's also on the circle? But the circle is named B, so maybe B is a point on the circle? That could be possible. Wait, the initial predicates list Point(R), Point(S), Point(T), and Circle(B). So B is the circle, but maybe there's a point named B as well? Wait, the user didn't mention a point B. Let me check again. 

Looking back:

Ah! Here, in the Angle(R, S, B), the third element is B, which is the circle. But angles require two points forming the arms, so maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps B is a point that's not listed? Like maybe B is the center of the circle? Because if B is the center, then the points R, S, T are on the circle, and angles at S involving the center. Let me assume that B is the center of the circle. That would make sense because otherwise, the angle can't be formed with B as a circle. So maybe there was a mistake in the predicate naming, and B is both the circle and the center point. That’s a common convention in geometry problems where the circle's name is used as the center. 

Assuming B is the center of the circle, then R, S, T are points on the circumference. Now, the angles:

Angle(R, S, B): This would be the angle at point S between points R and B. Since B is the center, and S is on the circle, RS is a chord from R to S, and SB is a radius from S to the center B. Similarly, Angle(B, S, T) is the angle at S between B and T. So that would be the angle between SB and ST. 

Now, the measure of Angle(R, S, B) is x, and Angle(B, S, T) is 2x. Then, the sum of these three angles: Angle(R, S, B) + Angle(B, S, T) + Angle(T, R, B) equals 360 degrees. Wait, but Angle(T, R, B) would be the angle at R between T and B. 

But let me think about the configuration. Points R, S, T are on the circle with center B. So connecting them forms triangle RST, but since B is the center, connecting BR, BS, BT are radii. 

So, considering angle at S between R and B: that is angle RSB. Similarly, angle at S between B and T is angle BST. And the third angle is angle TRB. Wait, but the third angle in the sum is MeasureOf(Angle(T, R, B)), which would be angle at R between T and B. 

Wait, but if we look at the sum of those three angles: angle RSB (x), angle BST (2x), and angle TRB. Let me try to find relations between these angles. 

Since B is the center, BR = BS = BT, as they are radii. Therefore, triangles BRS, BST, and BTR are all isosceles triangles. 

First, consider angle RSB (x). In triangle BRS, sides BR and BS are equal. So the base angles at R and S are equal. Wait, angle at S is x, so angle at R in triangle BRS would be equal to x? Wait, no. Wait, triangle BRS has vertices at B, R, S. The angle at S is angle RSB, which is x. Then the other angles are at B and R. Wait, but since BR and BS are radii, so BR=BS. Therefore, triangle BRS is isosceles with BR=BS, so angles opposite those sides are equal. The side opposite angle at S (which is x) is BR. Wait, no: in triangle BRS, the sides are BR, BS, and RS. Since BR and BS are equal, the base is RS. Therefore, angles opposite those equal sides are equal. Wait, the angles opposite BR and BS would be angles at S and R respectively. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In triangle BRS, the sides are BR, BS, RS. BR and BS are equal. So the triangle is isosceles with BR = BS. Therefore, the base angles are at R and S. Wait, no: the base is RS, so the legs are BR and BS. Therefore, the base angles would be at R and S. So angle at R (opposite BS) and angle at S (opposite BR) are equal. Wait, but BR = BS, so angles opposite them would be equal. Wait, angle opposite BR is angle at S, and angle opposite BS is angle at R. Therefore, angle at S (which is angle RSB) equals angle at R (angle SBR). Therefore, angle SBR equals x. So in triangle BRS, angles at R and S are each x, making the third angle at B equal to 180 - 2x. 

Similarly, looking at angle BST, which is 2x. That's part of triangle BST. Again, BS and BT are radii, so triangle BST is isosceles with BS=BT. Therefore, angles at T and S are equal. The angle at S is 2x, so angle at T is also 2x, and angle at B would be 180 - 2*(2x) = 180 - 4x. 

Now, the third angle mentioned in the sum is angle TRB. Which would be part of triangle TRB. Let me see. Point T is connected to R and B. So triangle TRB. In this triangle, TB and BR are radii, so TB = BR. Hence, triangle TRB is isosceles with TB = BR. Therefore, angles at T and R are equal. The angle at R is angle TRB, which is part of the sum. Let me denote that angle as y. Then, the angle at T in triangle TRB would also be y, and the angle at B would be 180 - 2y. 

But how do these angles relate to each other? The total sum of the three angles given in the problem is x + 2x + y = 360 degrees. So 3x + y = 360. 

But we need to find another equation relating x and y. Let's think about the full diagram. Points R, S, T are on the circle centered at B. So connecting all these points, we have arcs and angles. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the entire figure. The angles at points S and R involve the center B. Let me think about the angles around the center. For example, angles at B in triangles BRS, BST, and TRB. 

Earlier, in triangle BRS, angle at B is 180 - 2x. In triangle BST, angle at B is 180 - 4x. In triangle TRB, angle at B is 180 - 2y. However, the sum of these three angles at B should correspond to the total angle around point B. Wait, but around a point, the sum of angles is 360 degrees. However, these angles may not cover the entire 360 degrees unless the points R, S, T are arranged such that the angles at B sum up to 360. But that depends on the order of the points on the circle. 

Assume that points R, S, T are placed in order around the circle. Then the central angles between them would add up to 360 degrees. Each central angle corresponds to the angle at B between two adjacent points. For instance, between R and S, the central angle is angle RBS, which we found earlier as 180 - 2x. Between S and T, the central angle is angle SBT, which is 180 - 4x. Between T and R, the central angle is angle TBR, which is 180 - 2y. Adding these three central angles gives the total around point B: 

(180 - 2x) + (180 - 4x) + (180 - 2y) = 540 - 6x - 2y. 

But since these central angles form a full circle around point B, their sum must be 360 degrees. Therefore:

540 - 6x - 2y = 360  
=> 6x + 2y = 540 - 360 = 180  
Divide both sides by 2: 3x + y = 90. 

But earlier, from the sum of the three angles given in the problem: x + 2x + y = 360 => 3x + y = 360. 

Wait, that leads us to two equations:

From the angles around point B: 3x + y = 90  
From the sum given in the problem: 3x + y = 360  

This is a contradiction unless there's a miscalculation. That suggests an error in my reasoning. 

Where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine. 

First, the central angles: When I considered the angles at B in each triangle, I assumed that the central angles between R-S, S-T, and T-R are the ones from the triangles. However, the central angles between R and S is actually angle RBS. Wait, in triangle BRS, angle at B is angle RBS, which is the central angle between points R and S. Similarly, angle SBT is the central angle between S and T, and angle TBR is the central angle between T and R. Thus, adding these three angles should give the total around point B, which is 360 degrees. 

So the sum of those three central angles is:

angle RBS + angle SBT + angle TBR = 360°

Earlier, I calculated angle RBS as 180 - 2x, angle SBT as 180 - 4x, and angle TBR as 180 - 2y. Summing these:

(180 - 2x) + (180 - 4x) + (180 - 2y) = 540 - 6x - 2y = 360  
Thus, 540 - 6x - 2y = 360 → 6x + 2y = 180 → 3x + y = 90. 

But according to the problem statement, the sum of the three angles x, 2x, and y is 360°, giving 3x + y = 360. So combining these two equations:

Equation 1: 3x + y = 90  
Equation 2: 3x + y = 360  

Which implies 90 = 360, which is impossible. So there must be a mistake in my assumptions. 

Let me check the derivation of the angles again. 

Starting with triangle BRS: angle at S is x. Since BR = BS, the triangle is isosceles with BR = BS. Therefore, angles at R and S are equal. Wait, no! Wait, in triangle BRS, the sides BR and BS are equal. Therefore, the base is RS, and the two equal sides are BR and BS. Therefore, the base angles are at R and S. Wait, no: the base angles are the angles opposite the equal sides. Wait, if BR = BS, then the angles opposite them are equal. The angle opposite BR is at S (since BR connects to B and R; the side opposite BR would be the angle at S). Similarly, the angle opposite BS is at R. So angle at S (which is x) equals angle at R in triangle BRS. Therefore, angle at R (in triangle BRS) is x. 

Therefore, in triangle BRS, angles are: at S: x, at R: x, and at B: 180 - 2x. So angle RBS (the central angle between R and S) is 180 - 2x. Correct. 

Next, angle BST is 2x. This is the angle at S between B and T. So in triangle BST, angle at S is 2x. Since BS = BT (radii), triangle BST is isosceles with BS = BT. Therefore, angles at T and S are equal. Wait, angle at S is 2x, so angle at T in triangle BST is also 2x. Therefore, angle at B in triangle BST is 180 - 2*(2x) = 180 - 4x. So angle SBT (central angle between S and T) is 180 - 4x. 

For the third angle, angle TRB. This is the angle at R between T and B. So in triangle TRB, which is isosceles with TB = BR (radii). Therefore, angles at T and R are equal. The angle at R is angle TRB (denoted as y), so angle at T in triangle TRB is also y. Therefore, angle at B in triangle TRB is 180 - 2y. So angle TBR (central angle between T and R) is 180 - 2y. 

Adding up the three central angles: (180 - 2x) + (180 - 4x) + (180 - 2y) = 540 - 6x - 2y = 360 → 6x + 2y = 180 → 3x + y = 90. 

But the problem states that the sum of the three angles x, 2x, and y is 360°, leading to 3x + y = 360. Contradiction arises. So something is wrong. 

Perhaps my interpretation of the angles is incorrect. Let me reconsider the angles given in the problem. The problem mentions:

MeasureOf(Angle(R, S, B)) = x  
MeasureOf(Angle(B, S, T)) = 2x  
MeasureOf(Angle(T, R, B)) = ??

Wait, the third angle is MeasureOf(Angle(T, R, B)). This would be the angle at R between T and B. So angle TRB, which I denoted as y. So the sum x + 2x + y = 3x + y = 360. 

But earlier, from the central angles, 3x + y = 90. So this contradiction suggests that my assumption about the central angles might be wrong. Perhaps the angles at B in the triangles aren't the central angles. Wait, why am I assuming that angle RBS is the central angle between R and S? Well, yes, because B is the center. So angle RBS is indeed the central angle between points R and S. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles in the problem aren't referring to the central angles. Let me think differently. 

Suppose instead of B being the center, B is just a point on the circle. Wait, but then the circle is named B, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the angles are not central angles but inscribed angles. 

Wait, if B is a point on the circle, then the angles at S involving B would be inscribed angles. But in that case, for example, angle RSB would be an inscribed angle subtending arc RB. However, without knowing the position of B, it's hard to tell. This is getting confusing. 

Maybe there's another approach. Let's consider the sum of the three angles given: x + 2x + y = 360. From the problem. So 3x + y = 360. 

Also, from the central angles sum, we had 3x + y = 90. These two equations can't both be true unless there's an error. So perhaps my calculation of the central angles is wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the angles at B in the triangles are not the central angles. For example, angle RBS is the central angle, but angle at B in triangle BRS is part of that. Wait, in triangle BRS, angle at B is angle RBS, which is the central angle between R and S. So that should be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles in the problem are not the angles inside the triangles but something else. Let me re-express the problem. 

The problem says:

- Points R, S, T are on circle B. 
- Angles: 
   - Angle(R, S, B) = x → angle at S between R and B. 
   - Angle(B, S, T) = 2x → angle at S between B and T. 
   - Angle(T, R, B) = ? → angle at R between T and B. 

Sum of these three angles is 360. 

So imagine standing at point S: angle between R and B is x, and between B and T is 2x. At point R, angle between T and B is y. 

So the total of these three angles is x + 2x + y = 360. 

But how do these angles relate to each other? Let me draw this mentally. 

At point S, the two angles x and 2x are adjacent, forming a larger angle. Since the points R, S, T are on the circle, and B is the center, maybe the sum of these angles relates to the arcs. 

Alternatively, consider the total angle around point S. Normally, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. But here, we have two angles at S: x and 2x. Are there more angles? 

Wait, if B is the center, then at point S, there are several lines: SR, SB, and ST. So the angles at S would be between SR and SB (which is x), between SB and ST (which is 2x), and between ST and...? Wait, depending on the arrangement. If the points are ordered R, S, T around the circle, then from point S, the lines would be SR, SB (center), and ST. So the angles at S would be between SR and SB (x), between SB and ST (2x), and between ST and SR (which would be the remaining angle). Wait, but the sum of angles around point S should be 360 degrees. So x + 2x + angle between ST and SR = 360. So that angle would be 360 - 3x. 

But what does that angle represent? It would be the angle between ST and SR at point S, which is the external angle. However, since points R, S, T are on the circle, and B is the center, this angle could relate to the arc RT. 

But how does this connect to the rest of the problem? 

Additionally, we have the third angle at R: angle TRB = y. So the sum x + 2x + y = 360. 

But also, considering the angles around point S, we have x + 2x + (some angle) = 360. That some angle is the angle between ST and SR, which might be related to the arc RT. 

However, I'm not sure how to connect this to the other parts. 

Let me try another approach. Assume that the three angles x, 2x, and y are the angles at points S, S, and R respectively, and their sum is 360. 

But if we think of the entire figure, maybe these angles are part of a star or some polygon. Alternatively, consider that the points R, S, T are arranged such that lines from B (center) to each point create certain angles. 

Let me think about the triangle formed by R, S, T. But since B is the center, connecting B to each of R, S, T creates three radii. 

Alternatively, maybe the three angles given are part of a triangle or another shape. 

Wait, the sum of the three angles x, 2x, and y is 360. So x + 2x + y = 360 → 3x + y = 360. 

But from earlier, using the central angles, I got 3x + y = 90. This inconsistency suggests that my previous assumption that B is the center might be wrong. 

Alternative idea: What if B is not the center, but one of the points on the circle? Wait, the circle is named B, so B is the circle, not a point. So perhaps there's a different configuration. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not involving the center. Suppose B is just another point on the circle. Let me try that. 

Points R, S, T, and B are all on the circle. So four points on a circle. 

Angle(R, S, B) is the angle at S between R and B. Since all are on the circle, this is an inscribed angle. Similarly, Angle(B, S, T) is the angle at S between B and T, which is another inscribed angle. 

For inscribed angles, the measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Let me analyze Angle(R, S, B). This is an inscribed angle with vertex at S, intercepting arc RB. So its measure is half the arc RB. Similarly, Angle(B, S, T) is an inscribed angle at S, intercepting arc BT. Its measure is half arc BT. 

Given that Angle(R, S, B) = x, so arc RB is 2x. Angle(B, S, T) = 2x, so arc BT is 4x. 

Now, the third angle, Angle(T, R, B), is an angle at R between T and B. This would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc TB. Wait, or maybe arc TB? Let me see. The angle at R between T and B would intercept arc TB. So its measure is half the arc TB. 

Wait, but arc TB is already 4x from before. So that angle would be 2x. But the sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x = 72. But 72 isn't among the options. Hmm, but the options are A-D: 30,40,50,60. So this doesn't align. 

Alternatively, maybe the third angle intercepts a different arc. Let me double-check. 

Angle(T, R, B) is the angle at R between T and B. So the intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle, which would be arc TB. So yes, it would be half the arc TB. 

But earlier, arc BT is 4x, so this angle would be 2x. So sum is x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x=72. Not matching the options. So this suggests an error. 

Wait, maybe the third angle intercepts a different arc. Let me think again. 

When you have an angle at R between T and B, the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain R. Since points T and B are on the circle, the angle at R would intercept arc TB. So yes, the same as before. 

But then the sum of the three angles is x + 2x + (arc TB)/2 = x + 2x + (4x)/2 = x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x=72. Still not matching. 

Hmm. Maybe the intercepted arc is different. Let me think: if the angle is at R between T and B, then the intercepted arc is arc TB that doesn't pass through R. But since R is also on the circle, the arc TB could be major or minor. Depending on the position of R. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in order R, S, T, B on the circle. Wait, but B is the circle, not a point. So this is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the third angle is an exterior angle or something else. 

This approach isn't working. Let me revisit the original problem and see if there's another way. 

Original problem: Points R, S, T on circle B. Angles at S: x and 2x. Sum of three angles (including one at R) is 360. 

Maybe the three angles together form a full rotation around some point. For example, if you stand at point S, the angles x and 2x are parts of the angles around S. But since there are three angles, perhaps they are parts of the angles around S and R. 

Alternatively, think of the three angles as angles of a triangle. Wait, no, they sum to 360, which is more than 180. 

Another idea: The three angles x, 2x, and y are the angles of a triangle, but that doesn't fit because their sum is 360. 

Wait, but if you have three angles that add to 360, it's possible if they are angles around a point. 

Wait, the problem says: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(R, S, B)), MeasureOf(Angle(B, S, T)), MeasureOf(Angle(T, R, B))) = 360. 

So these three angles are around different points? Or maybe they are angles around a point. 

Let me think about the three angles: 

1. Angle(R, S, B): at S, between R and B. 
2. Angle(B, S, T): at S, between B and T. 
3. Angle(T, R, B): at R, between T and B. 

These are angles at different points. How do they add up to 360? It's unclear. 

But the problem states that their sum is 360. So x + 2x + y = 360. 

If I assume that the three angles are the angles around point S and point R, but I don't see a direct connection. 

Let me try plugging in the answer choices. Let's say x is 60 (option D). Then 3x + y = 360 → 180 + y = 360 → y = 180. But an angle of 180 degrees would mean a straight line, which might not make sense. 

If x is 60, then the second angle is 120. The third angle y would be 180. But this seems unlikely. 

Try x=40 (option B). Then 3*40 + y = 360 → 120 + y = 360 → y=240. Still large. 

x=30 (option A): 90 + y = 360 → y=270. 

x=50 (option C): 150 + y = 360 → y=210. 

None of these seem plausible. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between y and x through other geometric constraints. 

Let me think about the triangle formed by R, S, T. If B is the center, then BR, BS, BT are radii. 

At point S, angles x and 2x are formed with lines to B and to T. So, if I consider triangle SBT, where BS and BT are radii, and angle at S is 2x. 

In triangle SBT, angles at S is 2x, at T is 2x (since it's isosceles), and at B is 180 - 4x. 

Similarly, at point R, angle TRB is y, and in triangle TRB, which is isosceles with BR=TB, so angles at R and T are y each, and at B is 180 - 2y. 

Now, the central angles at B: angle RBS (from triangle BRS) is 180 - 2x, angle SBT is 180 - 4x, and angle TBR is 180 - 2y. 

As before, their sum is 540 - 6x - 2y = 360 → 6x + 2y = 180 → 3x + y = 90. 

But from the problem, 3x + y = 360. 

This suggests that either the problem has conflicting conditions, or there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, maybe the sum of the three angles given in the problem is not directly related to the central angles. Let me think: 

The three angles given are at points S, S, and R. Their sum is 360. 

But how do these relate to the central angles? 

Maybe the sum of these angles is related to the total angles around the points. 

At point S, the angles x and 2x are parts of the angles around S. The total around point S is 360 degrees. So x + 2x + other_angle_at_S = 360. The other_angle_at_S would be the angle between the lines ST and SR, which is the reflex angle or the non-reflex angle. 

But if the points are arranged such that S is between R and T, then the angle between ST and SR would be the reflex angle. However, typically, angles are measured as the smaller one unless specified. 

Assuming that the angles x and 2x are the smaller angles at S, then the remaining angle at S would be 360 - 3x. 

This angle at S is part of the circle, so it could relate to the arc RT. 

Meanwhile, the angle at R, which is y, is part of the triangle TRB. 

But how to connect these? 

Let me try to use the fact that the sum of the three given angles is 360. 

So x + 2x + y = 360 → 3x + y = 360. 

And from the central angles, 3x + y = 90. 

This suggests that 3x + y = 90 and 3x + y = 360, which is impossible. 

Unless there's a mistake in interpreting the angles. 

Wait, perhaps the third angle y is not part of the central angles. Maybe it's a different angle. 

Let me consider that the angle at R, y, is an inscribed angle. If so, it would relate to an arc. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Let me try to assume that B is the center. Then, from the central angles, we have 3x + y = 90. From the problem, 3x + y = 360. This is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my understanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the ones I thought. For example, Angle(R, S, B) is not the angle at S but at R? Wait, the notation Angle(R, S, B) is usually interpreted as the angle at S, with segments SR and SB. 

If that's the case, then my previous analysis holds. 

But since the equations contradict, perhaps the problem assumes that B is not the center. Let me try to think of B as a regular point on the circle. 

If B is a point on the circle, then the angles at S and B would be inscribed angles. 

Let me try this: 

Angle(R, S, B) is an inscribed angle at S, intercepting arc RB. So its measure is half the arc RB. Let's call arc RB = 2x. 

Angle(B, S, T) is an inscribed angle at S, intercepting arc BT. So its measure is half arc BT = 2x → arc BT = 4x. 

Now, the third angle, Angle(T, R, B), is an inscribed angle at R, intercepting arc TB. So its measure is half arc TB = 2x. 

Wait, but then the sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x = 72, which is not an option. 

But if the third angle intercepts a different arc. Let me think: Angle(T, R, B) at R, between T and B. This would intercept arc TB that does not pass through R. If the arc TB is 4x, then the angle is 2x. But if the arc TB passes through R, then the angle would be half the difference of the arcs. 

Wait, inscribed angle can also be calculated as half the difference of the intercepted arcs if it's an angle formed by two chords. Wait, no, standard inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. 

If the angle at R is between T and B, then it intercepts arc TB. If the arc TB is 4x, then the angle is 2x. 

But then the sum is x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x=72. 

Still not matching. 

Maybe the intercepted arc for the third angle is different. Let me calculate the total circumference. 

Arc RB is 2x, arc BT is 4x, so total arc from R to B to T is 6x. But the total circumference is 360 degrees. So 6x = 360 → x=60. 

Wait, this is interesting. If arc RB is 2x, arc BT is 4x, then combined arc RB + BT is 6x, which would be part of the circumference. But if the points are arranged as R, B, T on the circle, then the arc RB + arc BT would be arc RT. But this depends on the position of B. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in the order R, B, T on the circle, then the arc RB + arc BT = arc RT. But this would mean that arc RT is 6x. 

But then, what about the remaining arc from T back to R? That would be 360 - 6x. 

But how does this relate to the angle at R? 

The angle at R, Angle(TRB), would intercept arc TB. If arc TB is 4x, then the angle is 2x. 

But this brings us back to the same issue: x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → x=72. 

But if arc RT is 6x, and the total circumference is 360, then 6x = 360 → x=60. 

Wait, this suggests x=60, which is option D. 

But why is this possible? Let me explain: 

If arc RB is 2x, arc BT is 4x, then the arc from R to T via B is 6x. If this is the entire circumference, then 6x = 360 → x=60. 

But this assumes that the arc RT passing through B is the whole circle, which would mean that points R, B, T are arranged such that B is between R and T on the circle. 

In this case, the angle at S (between R and B) is x, which is half arc RB (so arc RB is 2x), and the angle at S between B and T is 2x, which is half arc BT (so arc BT is 4x). Then, the total arc from R to T via B is 6x = 360 → x=60. 

This would make x=60, which is option D. 

But what about the third angle, Angle(T, R, B)? This angle is at R, between T and B. This would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc TB. Since arc TB is 4x, the angle is 2x. 

But then the sum of the three angles would be x + 2x + 2x = 5x = 360 → 5*60 = 300 ≠ 360. 

Contradiction again. 

Wait, but if arc RT is 6x = 360, then x=60. But the sum of the three angles is 5x = 300, which is less than 360. Where is the missing 60 degrees? 

Ah, perhaps the third angle is not 2x but something else. Let me think: 

If the angle at R, Angle(TRB), is an inscribed angle intercepting arc TB, but if the arc TB is 4x, then the angle is 2x. But if the arc TB is the major arc, then the angle would be half the measure of the major arc. 

Wait, but the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. If the arc TB is the major arc, then the angle would be half of that. 

But in this scenario, if arc TB is 4x, and the total circumference is 360, then the major arc TB would be 360 - 4x. 

But this is getting too ambiguous. 

Let me try to focus on the condition that arc RT is 6x = 360 → x=60. This satisfies the arc condition, even though the angle sum doesn't. 

But if x=60, then the third angle would be 2x=120, making the sum x+2x+120 = 60+120+120 = 300, still not 360. 

But the problem states that the sum is 360. So this suggests that there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the third angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle. If Angle(TRB) is a central angle, then it would be equal to the arc it subtends. 

If B is the center, then Angle(TRB) is a central angle, so it would equal arc TB. But arc TB is 4x, so the angle would be 4x. 

Then, the sum of the three angles would be x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 360 → x = 360/7 ≈ 51.4, which is not an option. 

But none of the options match this. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent without reaching a consistent solution, perhaps the intended answer is D.60, assuming that the arc RT is 6x = 360, hence x=60. Even though the angle sum doesn't match, it's the only option that fits the arc condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the three angles is meant to be 360, and the correct value is x=60. 

Let me try this: if x=60, then the sum is 60 + 120 + y = 360 → y=180. This would mean that the angle at R is 180 degrees, which would imply that points T, R, B are colinear, making TB a straight line. 

If TB is a straight line, then B is diametrically opposite to T, but since B is the circle, this is not possible unless B is the center. 

If B is the center, then TB is a radius, so a straight line would mean that B is the center and TB is a radius, but that would require T to be on the circle, which it is. If angle at R is 180 degrees, it would mean that points T, R, B are colinear, with R on the circle and B as the center. So BR is a radius, and RT is a line extending from R through B to T. But T is on the circle, so BR + RT = 2r, but this depends on the position. 

This might be possible, and if so, then x=60 would be the answer. 

Given that this is the only option that fits the arc condition (6x=360), and the other options don't fit, I'll choose D.
