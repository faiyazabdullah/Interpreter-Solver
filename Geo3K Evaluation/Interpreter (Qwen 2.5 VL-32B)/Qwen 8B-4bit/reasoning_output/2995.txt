MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what needs to be found. The problem states that triangles BCD and WXY are congruent. We have several predicates that give us information about angles and lengths. 

Starting with the given angles. There's an equation saying that the measure of angle BCD (which is at point C) equals the measure of angle WXY. Wait, actually, looking back, the measure of angle (B,C,D) is given as 20x - 4, and the measure of angle (W,X,Y) is 77 degrees. Also, there's another equality stating that the measure of angle (C,B,D) equals the measure of angle (X,W,Y). Let me note down these equations.

So, first, the two triangles are congruent. That means all corresponding parts are equal. Since they're congruent, their corresponding angles should be equal. But how do we know which angles correspond? In triangle BCD, the vertices are B, C, D. In triangle WXY, the vertices are W, X, Y. Since the triangles are congruent, the order matters. So if Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y), then angle at B corresponds to angle at W, angle at C corresponds to angle at X, and angle at D corresponds to angle at Y. Wait, but sometimes congruence notation can vary depending on the order. Let me confirm.

In congruence, the order of the letters indicates correspondence. So Triangle ABC ≅ Triangle DEF implies angle A corresponds to D, angle B to E, angle C to F. Therefore, here, Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WXY would mean angle B corresponds to W, angle C to X, angle D to Y. 

But wait, the problem also gives measures for angles. For example, the measure of angle (B,C,D) is 20x - 4. That angle is at point C, since the middle letter is the vertex. Similarly, angle (W,X,Y) is at point X. And according to the given, the measure of angle (B,C,D) equals the measure of angle (W,X,Y). So angle at C in triangle BCD equals angle at X in triangle WXY. Which would imply that those angles are corresponding angles. 

Also, another equality: measure of angle (C,B,D) equals measure of angle (X,W,Y). Angle (C,B,D) is at point B, because the middle letter is B. Wait, no: angle (C,B,D) has vertex at B, so it's angle at B between points C and D. Similarly, angle (X,W,Y) is at point W, between points X and Y. So that would mean angle at B in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. 

Wait, but earlier, we thought that angle B corresponds to angle W. So angle at B (from angle (C,B,D)) would correspond to angle at W (from angle (X,W,Y)). So that seems consistent. 

Now, let's write down the equations. 

First, measure of angle (B,C,D) = 20x - 4. This is angle at C in triangle BCD. According to the congruence, this should equal measure of angle (W,X,Y), which is given as 77 degrees. So:

20x - 4 = 77

Solving this equation:

20x = 77 + 4 → 20x = 81 → x = 81 / 20 = 4.05. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y))). So angle (B,C,D) is angle at C, which is part of triangle BCD. Then angle (W,X,Y) is angle at Y in triangle WXY. Wait, but earlier I thought that angle (W,X,Y) is at X. Wait, no! Wait, angle (W,X,Y) is formed by points W, X, Y. So the vertex is X. Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X. So the measure of angle (B,C,D) equals measure of angle (W,X,Y), which is angle at X. 

But according to congruence, triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY. So angle at C in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY. Therefore, angle (B,C,D) which is angle at C equals angle at X, which is angle (W,X,Y). Therefore, the equation 20x - 4 = 77 is correct. Solving gives x=81/20=4.05. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the congruence implies different correspondences. Maybe the angles aren't matching up that way. Let me think again. 

Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. However, the order of the letters in the congruence statement is important. The congruence is Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y). Therefore, angle B corresponds to angle W, angle C corresponds to angle X, angle D corresponds to angle Y. 

Therefore, angle at B in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. 

Similarly, angle at C corresponds to angle at X. 

Angle at D corresponds to angle at Y. 

So angle (B,C,D) is angle at C. So angle at C in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY. Therefore, angle (B,C,D) equals angle (X,W,Y)? Wait, angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In triangle WXY, angle (X,W,Y) would be angle at W. Because the middle letter is W. So angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W. Wait, but according to the congruence, angle at C (in triangle BCD) corresponds to angle at X (in triangle WXY). Therefore, angle at C equals angle at X. 

But the given equality says that measure of angle (B,C,D) equals measure of angle (W,X,Y). Wait, angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X. So angle (B,C,D) equals angle (W,X,Y), which is angle at X. Therefore, angle at C equals angle at X. Which aligns with the congruence. 

Then, another equality is measure of angle (C,B,D) equals measure of angle (X,W,Y). Angle (C,B,D) is angle at B in triangle BCD. Angle (X,W,Y) is angle at Y in triangle WXY. Wait, no. Let's parse angle (X,W,Y): the middle letter is W, so it's angle at W. So angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W. 

But according to congruence, angle at B in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. Therefore, angle at B equals angle at W. So angle (C,B,D) is angle at B, which corresponds to angle (X,W,Y) which is angle at W. So that equation holds. 

So we have two equations:

1. Measure of angle (B,C,D) = measure of angle (W,X,Y) → angle at C equals angle at X → 20x -4 = 77. 

But solving this gives x = 81/20 = 4.05, which isn't an option. So maybe there's another equation involving the other angles?

Wait, also, the problem mentions that the measure of angle (C,B,D) is 24x +5. Let me check that. 

Looking back, the given predicates say:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 20*x - 4)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), 24*x + 5)

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y)))

So angle (C,B,D) is angle at B, which is 24x+5, and equals angle (X,W,Y), which is angle at W. 

But since triangles are congruent, angle at B (in BCD) equals angle at W (in WXY). So that equation is okay. 

Additionally, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, maybe we can use that. 

Let me try to compute the angles in triangle BCD. 

We have angle at C: 20x -4, angle at B: 24x +5, and angle at D: ?

Wait, in triangle BCD, the three angles are at points B, C, D. Their measures add up to 180. 

So angle at B: 24x +5, angle at C: 20x -4, angle at D: ?

Let me find angle at D. Let's denote angle D as some value. 

Sum of angles: (24x +5) + (20x -4) + angle D = 180. 

Combine terms: 44x +1 + angle D = 180 → angle D = 179 -44x. 

But since the triangle is congruent to WXY, the angles in WXY should correspond. For instance, angle at X (which was equal to angle at C, which is 20x-4), angle at W (equal to angle at B, 24x+5), and angle at Y (which would be equal to angle at D, 179-44x). 

But also, in triangle WXY, the angles are angle at W, X, Y. Given that angle (W,X,Y) is 77 degrees (angle at X), angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W, and angle (W,Y,X) is angle at Y. 

Wait, the problem also gives that measure of angle (W,X,Y) is 77, which is angle at X. So angle at X is 77 degrees. Which is equal to angle at C (since congruent triangles). So 20x -4 =77. As before. 

But solving that gives x=81/20, which is not an integer. However, the answer choices are integers. So this suggests that my initial assumption may be wrong. Perhaps the correspondence of angles is different?

Alternatively, maybe the congruence is not in the order given? Like, maybe the triangles are congruent in a different order. For example, maybe triangle BCD ≅ triangle WYX, leading to different angle correspondences. But the problem states Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y), so the order is fixed. 

Wait, unless there's a typo in the problem, but assuming the problem is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angle measures. Let me recheck the given predicates:

The user wrote:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), 20*x - 4)

Which is angle at C. 

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), 24*x + 5)

Which is angle at B. 

Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y))) → angle at C equals angle at X (since angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X).

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y))) → angle at B equals angle at W (since angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W). 

So that gives two equations:

Equation 1: 20x -4 = measure of angle at X (which is 77). So 20x -4 =77 → x=(77+4)/20=81/20=4.05. Not an option.

Equation 2: 24x+5 = measure of angle at W. But since triangles are congruent, angle at W is equal to angle at B. But angle at W is part of triangle WXY. What's the third angle in triangle WXY?

In triangle WXY, angles are at W, X, Y. We know angle at X is 77 degrees. Let me call angle at W as α and angle at Y as β. Then α + 77 + β = 180. Also, since triangle WXY is congruent to BCD, the angles are same. So angle at W (α) equals angle at B (24x +5), angle at X (77) equals angle at C (20x -4), and angle at Y (β) equals angle at D (which is 179 -44x). 

So for triangle WXY, angles are:

At W: 24x +5,

At X: 77,

At Y: 179 -44x.

Thus, adding them up: (24x +5) + 77 + (179 -44x) = 180.

Calculating:

24x +5 +77 +179 -44x = (24x -44x) + (5+77+179) = (-20x) + 261 = 180.

So -20x +261 = 180 → -20x = -81 → x = 81/20 = 4.05 again. Same result. 

Hmm. So even combining all equations leads to x=4.05. But answer choices are integers. So where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe there's another equation involving the length of sides? The problem also includes LengthOf(Line(B,D)) = 11, and LengthOf(Line(W,X)) = 2x +5. Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding sides are equal. So BD corresponds to WX. Hence, length of BD equals length of WX. 

Given that LengthOf(BD)=11, so LengthOf(WX)=2x +5. Thus:

2x +5 = 11 → 2x =6 → x=3. 

Ah! This gives x=3, which is one of the options. So why didn't I consider this earlier? Because I focused on angles but forgot about the side lengths. 

So the key is that since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. The given LengthOf(B,D) is 11. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding side in the other triangle would be Line(W,X), because in the congruence Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y), the side BD corresponds to XY? Or which sides correspond?

Wait, the correspondence of sides depends on the order of the vertices. In congruence Triangle ABC ≅ Triangle DEF, side AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, and AC to DF. So for Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WXY, the sides are:

Side BC corresponds to WX,

Side CD corresponds to XY,

Side DB corresponds to YW.

Wait, but the given LengthOf(Line(B,D)) is 11. Line(B,D) is side BD in triangle BCD. So in triangle WXY, the corresponding side would be YW, because in the congruence, BD corresponds to YW. Wait, but the given LengthOf(Line(W,X)) is 2x +5. So if BD corresponds to WX, then BD = WX. Is that correct?

Wait, let's think carefully. In Triangle BCD, the vertices are B, C, D. In Triangle WXY, the vertices are W, X, Y. So the order is such that B→W, C→X, D→Y. So the sides:

BC in BCD corresponds to WX in WXY,

CD corresponds to XY,

BD corresponds to WY.

So the side BD in triangle BCD corresponds to side WY in triangle WXY. But the given LengthOf(Line(W,X)) is 2x +5. That's side WX in triangle WXY, which corresponds to BC in triangle BCD. So if we were told that BC equals WX, then we could set up an equation. But the problem gives LengthOf(BD) = 11, which corresponds to WY. So unless there's more info about other sides, this might not help directly. Unless there's another side length given?

Wait, the problem does mention LengthOf(Line(W,X)) = 2x +5. So that's side WX in triangle WXY, which corresponds to BC in triangle BCD. But we don't have the length of BC given. So unless we can express BC in terms of x somehow. Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship.

Alternatively, since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding sides are equal. So BD in BCD equals WY in WXY. But we don't know the length of WY. However, the given LengthOf(W,X) is 2x +5. Which is side WX. So unless there's another relation, like using the Law of Cosines or something? Wait, but without knowing angles or other sides, maybe not. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me double-check. 

If BD corresponds to WY, but we don't have WY's length. However, if the problem had given another side, like BC or CD, then we could relate it. But since it doesn't, maybe the key is that the given side BD is 11, and the corresponding side in the other triangle is WX. Wait, no—BD corresponds to WY, not WX. So unless there's a misunderstanding in the correspondence. 

Wait, perhaps I got the correspondence wrong. Let me re-examine the congruence. Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y). So the order of the vertices is B→W, C→X, D→Y. Therefore:

- Side BC corresponds to WX,
- Side CD corresponds to XY,
- Side BD corresponds to WY.

So BD is a side in triangle BCD, connecting B to D. Its corresponding side in triangle WXY is WY. But the given LengthOf(W,X) is 2x +5, which is side WX. So unless there's another way to relate this. 

However, the problem gives LengthOf(Line(B,D)) = 11, and LengthOf(Line(W,X)) = 2x +5. If there's another condition that connects these, like if BD and WX are corresponding sides, then 11 = 2x +5 → x=3. But earlier, I thought BD corresponds to WY, not WX. So why would BD correspond to WX? That would be incorrect. 

Unless the triangles are congruent in a different way, like flipping or rotating. For example, maybe the correspondence is different. Suppose the congruence is Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WXY, but with a different mapping. For example, if the correspondence is B→W, C→Y, D→X. But that would change the correspondence of the sides. 

But the standard congruence notation assumes that the order of the letters determines the correspondence. So Triangle ABC ≅ Triangle DEF implies AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, CA to FD. So in our case, Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WXY implies BC corresponds to WX, CD to XY, and DB to YW. 

But the problem gives BD as a side, which is from B to D. So BD corresponds to WY. But the given LengthOf(W,X) is 2x +5, which is side WX. So unless there's a way to link BD to WX via other relations. 

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the correspondence. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different correspondence. For example, suppose the congruence is such that angle at B corresponds to angle at X, angle at C corresponds to angle at W, etc. But that would require a different ordering. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the triangles are congruent in a different order, like Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WYX, which would swap some correspondences. 

But given the problem states Triangle(B,C,D) ≅ Triangle(W,X,Y), we have to go with that. 

But here's another idea: since the triangles are congruent, their perimeters are equal. But we don't have enough information about the other sides. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines. For example, in triangle BCD, if we can find the lengths of sides and angles, we might relate them. 

But we only know one side: BD = 11. And we have expressions for angles in terms of x. 

Let me attempt that. 

In triangle BCD, angles are:

At B: 24x +5,

At C: 20x -4,

At D: 179 -44x (as calculated earlier). 

Using the Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle at C) = BC / sin(angle at D) = CD / sin(angle at B)

But we don't know BC or CD. However, since the triangles are congruent, the ratios would hold for triangle WXY. But without more data, this might not help. 

But wait, in triangle WXY, we know angle at X is 77 degrees. Let's see if we can find relations there. 

In triangle WXY, angles are:

At W: 24x +5 (since angle at W corresponds to angle at B),

At X: 77 degrees,

At Y: 179 -44x (corresponding to angle at D). 

Summing these angles: (24x +5) + 77 + (179 -44x) = 180, which simplifies to -20x + 261 = 180 → x=81/20 as before. 

This still gives x=4.05. But the answer choices are integers. 

But there's also the side length information. If we assume that BD corresponds to WX, then BD = WX. But BD is 11, and WX is 2x +5. So setting 11 = 2x +5 → x=3. 

Even though this contradicts the angle calculation, which gave x=4.05. This inconsistency suggests that there's an error in assumptions. 

Perhaps the problem expects us to use the side length equation despite the angle contradiction? Or maybe there's a miscalculation in the angle part. 

Wait, let's check the angle sums again. 

From the angle equations:

From the congruence, angle at C (20x -4) equals angle at X (77), giving x=81/20.

From the side lengths, BD=11 corresponds to WX=2x+5, giving x=3. 

These two results conflict. So which one is correct? 

Possibly, the problem expects us to prioritize the side length equation, as it's a direct equality, while the angles might involve more complex relationships. Or perhaps there's a mistake in assuming which sides correspond. 

Let me reconsider the correspondence of sides. If the triangles are congruent, then all corresponding sides are equal. So BD corresponds to a side in triangle WXY. Which side is that? 

In triangle BCD, the sides are BC, CD, BD. In triangle WXY, the sides are WX, XY, WY. 

Since the correspondence is B→W, C→X, D→Y, then:

- BC corresponds to WX,

- CD corresponds to XY,

- BD corresponds to WY.

So BD is a side in BCD, and its corresponding side in WXY is WY. But the given side length is WX=2x +5. So unless there's a relation between WY and other sides. 

But without knowing anything about other sides, we cannot relate WY to WX. However, if we assume that BD corresponds to WX, then we get x=3. But that would be incorrect correspondence. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the congruence is supposed to be Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WYX, making BD correspond to WY, and WX correspond to BC. But then we wouldn't have direct info about BD. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the triangles are congruent by ASA or SAS, allowing us to use the side and angle info. 

Wait, let's try to combine both equations. From the angles, we have x=81/20=4.05, and from the side lengths, x=3. These two can't both be true. So there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Let me re-express the angle equations. 

From the given:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) = 20x -4 = MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) = 77 → 20x-4=77 → x=81/20=4.05.

But if we take this x value and plug into the other angle equation:

MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)) = 24x +5. Let's calculate that with x=81/20:

24*(81/20) +5 = (1944/20) +5 = 97.2 +5 = 102.2 degrees.

Then, since the measure of angle (C,B,D) equals measure of angle (X,W,Y). Angle (X,W,Y) is angle at W in triangle WXY. 

In triangle WXY, angles are:

At W: 102.2 degrees,

At X: 77 degrees,

At Y: 180 - 102.2 -77 = 1.8 degrees. 

That's impossible, as an angle can't be less than zero. This indicates a contradiction, suggesting that my initial assumption about the correspondence of angles is wrong. 

So there must be an error in how I mapped the angles. Let me re-examine the angle correspondences. 

Given that Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WXY, the angles correspond as follows:

Angle B ↔ Angle W,

Angle C ↔ Angle X,

Angle D ↔ Angle Y.

Thus:

Angle at B (in BCD) corresponds to angle at W (in WXY).

Angle at C (in BCD) corresponds to angle at X (in WXY).

Angle at D (in BCD) corresponds to angle at Y (in WXY).

Now, the given equals:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) = MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y))

Angle (B,C,D) is angle at C in triangle BCD, which corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY. So angle at X in WXY is 77 degrees, as given. So 20x -4 =77 → x=4.05. 

Another given is MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)) = MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y))

Angle (C,B,D) is angle at B in triangle BCD, which corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. So angle at W in WXY is equal to 24x +5. 

In triangle WXY, angles are:

At W: 24x +5,

At X: 77,

At Y: ? 

Sum of angles: (24x +5) +77 + angle at Y = 180 → angle at Y = 180 -24x -5 -77 = 98 -24x. 

But angle at Y in triangle WXY corresponds to angle at D in triangle BCD. So angle at D in BCD is 98 -24x. 

But in triangle BCD, the angles are:

At B: 24x +5,

At C: 20x -4,

At D: 98 -24x. 

Sum: (24x +5) + (20x -4) + (98 -24x) = 24x +5 +20x -4 +98 -24x = (24x +20x -24x) + (5 -4 +98) = 20x +99. 

This must equal 180 → 20x +99 =180 → 20x=81 → x=81/20=4.05. 

Same result. 

So this confirms that x=81/20 is the only solution from angles. But the side length equation gives x=3. 

This discrepancy suggests that either the problem has conflicting conditions, or I've misunderstood the correspondence of sides. 

Let me revisit the side length. If BD corresponds to WY, then LengthOf(BD)=LengthOf(WY). But we don't know LengthOf(WY). However, we do know LengthOf(WX)=2x +5. If we can relate WY to other sides. 

In triangle WXY, using the Law of Cosines, for example. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if we assume that the triangles are congruent, then all corresponding sides are equal. So BD = WY, BC = WX, CD = XY. 

But we know BD=11, and WX=2x +5. If BC = WX, then BC =2x +5. But we don't have BC's length. 

Alternatively, if CD corresponds to XY, and we don't have CD's length. 

But since we have one side length, BD=11, and if it corresponds to WY, but we don't know WY's length, this doesn't help. 

Wait, but maybe the problem intends that BD corresponds to WX? Even though according to the congruence, it shouldn't. If we assume that, then 11=2x +5 → x=3. Let's see what happens with this x=3. 

Plugging x=3 into the angle equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) = 20*3 -4 =60-4=56 degrees. 

MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) is 77 degrees. But according to the given, these should be equal. 56 ≠77. So this is invalid. 

But if we ignore the angle condition and use the side length, x=3 would make BD=WX=11=2x+5 → x=3. 

But this conflicts with the angle condition. 

This suggests that the problem might have an error. Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angle correspondence. 

Wait, what if the congruence is not in the order given? What if the triangles are congruent in a different order? For example, Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WYX? Let's explore this possibility. 

If Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle WYX, then:

Correspondence:

B → W,

C → Y,

D → X.

Thus:

- Angle at B corresponds to angle at W,

- Angle at C corresponds to angle at Y,

- Angle at D corresponds to angle at X.

Now, let's reevaluate the angle equations. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) = MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)). 

Angle (B,C,D) is angle at C in triangle BCD, which now corresponds to angle at Y in triangle WYX. So angle at Y in triangle WYX is equal to angle at C in BCD. 

But the given MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) is angle at X in triangle WXY. Wait, if the triangle is WYX, then angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WYX. 

So if angle at C in BCD equals angle at X in WYX, then:

20x -4 = MeasureOf(Angle at X in WYX). 

But what is MeasureOf(Angle at X in WYX)? It would depend on the other angles. 

Also, MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)) = MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Y)). 

Angle (C,B,D) is angle at B in BCD, which corresponds to angle at W in WYX. So angle at W in WYX equals 24x +5. 

Now, in triangle WYX, angles are at W, Y, X. 

Let's denote:

Angle at W: 24x +5,

Angle at Y: 20x -4,

Angle at X: let's call it y. 

Sum: (24x +5) + (20x -4) + y = 180 → 44x +1 + y = 180 → y = 179 -44x. 

But angle at X in WYX is y = 179 -44x. 

But the given MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) is 77 degrees. Wait, angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X in triangle WXY. But if the triangle is WYX, then angle (W,X,Y) is angle at X. So this would be y = 179 -44x =77. 

So 179 -44x =77 → 44x = 179 -77 =102 → x=102/44 = 51/22 ≈2.318... Not an option. 

Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if the congruence is Triangle BCD ≅ Triangle YWX, changing the correspondence further. 

This trial and error suggests that the problem might have inconsistencies unless we use the side length equation. 

Given that the answer choices are integers, and the side length equation gives x=3, which is option B, and the angle equation gives non-integer, it's likely that the intended solution is to use the side length. 

Perhaps the problem assumes that BD corresponds to WX, even though according to the congruence it shouldn't. Or there's a mistake in the problem setup. 

Assuming that the correct approach is to equate the given side lengths, we get x=3. 

Therefore, the answer is B.
