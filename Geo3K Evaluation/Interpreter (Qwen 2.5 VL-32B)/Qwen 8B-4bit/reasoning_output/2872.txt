MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have four points—A, B, C, D—all lying on a circle centered at O. So, points B, C, D are on the circumference, and O is the center. There's also an arc BC mentioned, which probably means the arc from B to C on the circle. Additionally, there's an angle mentioned: Angle(B, D, C). That should be angle at point D, with segments DB and DC forming the angle. Wait, but how does that fit into the diagram?

Since all points are on the circle, maybe we're dealing with inscribed angles or something related to arcs. Let me recall some circle theorems. One key thing is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, if two points are connected to another point on the circle, the angle formed could relate to the arcs between those points.

Given that there's an arc BC, perhaps the angle at D intercepts that arc? Wait, angle BDC would intercept arc BC. But since D is another point on the circle, BD and CD are chords of the circle. So angle BDC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC. Therefore, the measure of angle BDC would be half the measure of arc BC. However, the question asks for the measure of angle 1, which I assume refers to angle BDC here. 

But wait, the problem mentions Angle(B, D, C) which is angle at D, so yes, angle BDC. If that's the case, then m∠BDC = ½ × measure of arc BC. But without knowing the measure of arc BC, how can we find the angle? Maybe there's more information I'm missing. 

Wait, all points are on the same circle. Are there any other arcs or angles mentioned? The arc BC is given, but maybe the position of D affects something else. For example, if D is positioned such that BD and CD are radii? No, because O is the center, but D is just a point on the circle. Unless D is diametrically opposite to some point, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry involved. Suppose arc BC is a certain measure. If angle BDC intercepts arc BC, then unless we know arc BC's measure, we can't compute the angle. But maybe arc BC is related to other elements. Wait, if points B, C, D are all on the circle, maybe triangle BCD is inscribed in the circle. But without more info, like arcs or other angles, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, could there be another way? Like if angle BDC is part of a different configuration. For instance, if BD and CD are chords, then maybe considering the central angle over arc BC. The central angle would be twice the inscribed angle. But again, without knowing arc BC's measure, how do we proceed? 

Hmm, maybe there's an assumption here. Since all points are on the circle, and arc BC is mentioned, but no other arcs. Wait, the problem doesn't give any numerical measures directly. So perhaps there's a standard configuration or maybe the angle is 90 degrees? Or maybe it's referring to a semicircle? If arc BC is 180 degrees, then angle BDC would be 90 degrees. But why would arc BC be a semicircle? Unless points B and C are endpoints of a diameter. But the problem doesn't state that. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. If D is located such that BD and CD are symmetrical or something. Alternatively, maybe triangle BCD is equilateral? But again, without knowing side lengths, that's speculative. 

Alternatively, think about the total circumference. The sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. If arc BC is x degrees, then angle BDC is x/2. But unless we have more arcs, we can't determine x. So maybe there's an implied property here. Wait, perhaps the arc BC is a major arc or minor arc? But again, without knowing where D is placed relative to BC, it's ambiguous. 

Wait, maybe angle BDC is actually an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BAC instead of arc BC, depending on where D is. If D is on the opposite side of the circle from arc BC, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc BC. But the problem states Arc(B,C), which typically denotes the minor arc unless specified otherwise. 

This seems stuck. Wait, but the answer choices include 90, which is a common angle in circles. Maybe there's a right angle here. For example, if BD is perpendicular to CD, making angle BDC 90 degrees. But how would that happen? If BD and CD are perpendicular, then triangle BDC would be right-angled at D. Which would mean that BC is the diameter, making angle BDC a right angle. Because in a circle, if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. 

So if BC were the diameter, then angle BDC would be 90 degrees. But the problem says arc BC is given. If arc BC is a semicircle (180 degrees), then BC is indeed the diameter. Then angle BDC would be 90 degrees. But how do we know that arc BC is a semicircle? The problem doesn't explicitly say that. 

Wait, but maybe there's another clue. All points A, B, C, D lie on the circle. If arc BC is given, but there's no mention of other arcs. However, if angle BDC intercepts arc BC, and if that arc is 180 degrees, then angle BDC is 90 degrees. But how can we confirm arc BC is 180 degrees? 

Unless the presence of point A implies something. Wait, point A is also on the circle. But there's no arc involving A mentioned. Unless the problem assumes that arc BC is a semicircle because of the positioning of other points. But without more info, this is pure speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is referring to a different arc. For example, if D is positioned such that arc BD equals arc DC, making triangle BDC isoceles. But again, without knowing specific measures, this isn't helpful. 

Wait, looking back at the answer choices, option B is 90. Given that angle BDC could be 90 degrees if BC is a diameter. Even though the problem doesn't explicitly state that BC is a diameter, maybe the arc BC is intended to be a semicircle. In many standardized problems, sometimes arcs are assumed to be semicircles if they aren't specified otherwise, especially when paired with right angles. 

Therefore, assuming that arc BC is 180 degrees, angle BDC would be half that, which is 90 degrees. Hence, the measure of angle 1 (which is angle BDC) is 90 degrees. So the answer would be B.
