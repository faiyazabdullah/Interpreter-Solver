MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have a circle C with points A, J, K. Line AJ is a diameter of circle C. Points A and J lie on the circle, so they're endpoints of the diameter. Point K also lies on the same circle. There's an angle at point C (the center?) between points J and K, and that angle measures 105 degrees. Wait, hold on—wait, the Angle(J,C,K) means the angle at point C formed by points J, C, K. So, point C is the center of the circle because AJ is the diameter, and since A and J are on the circle, the center would be the midpoint of AJ. But wait, the problem says IsDiameterOf(Line(A,J), Circle(C)). So the diameter is line AJ, and the circle is C. Therefore, the center of the circle C must be the midpoint of AJ. Let me confirm that. Since AJ is a diameter, its midpoint is the center. So point C is the center? Wait, but there's a point named C. Oh, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the problem mentions Circle(C). So the circle is named C. Then, the center of the circle C is not necessarily a point named C. Wait, maybe the problem uses C as both the circle and a point? Wait, looking back: the predicates are Point(A), Point(J), Point(K), Line(A,J), IsDiameterOf(Line(A,J), Circle(C)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(C)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J), Circle(C)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K), Circle(C)), Equals(DiameterOf(Circle(C)), 15), Angle(J,C,K), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,C,K)), 105).

Wait, there's a point named C? Or is it that the circle is named C? Because in geometry, usually, circles are named with a single uppercase letter, like Circle(C), implying that C is the center? Or perhaps the circle is named C, and the center is another point. Wait, but the problem has a point C? Let me check again. The first line says "Point(C)"? No, looking back:

Original input:

"Point(A)
Point(J)
Point(K)
Line(A,J)
IsDiameterOf(Line(A,J), Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J), Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K), Circle(C))
Equals(DiameterOf(Circle(C)), 15)
Angle(J,C,K)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,C,K)), 105)"

Ah, so the circle is named C. So the circle is called C, and the points are A, J, K. Also, there's a point C? Wait, no—the first line says Point(A), Point(J), Point(K). Then later, there's Angle(J,C,K)—so the angle is at point C. Therefore, point C exists as a separate point. Wait, but how? Because if the circle is named C, then maybe there's confusion. Wait, perhaps the circle is named C, and there's a point C? That seems conflicting. Maybe the circle's name is C, and the center is point C? Or maybe the circle is named C, and the center is another point. Wait, but the problem states that Line(A,J) is a diameter of Circle(C). Therefore, the diameter is the line segment AJ, which implies that the center of the circle is the midpoint of AJ. However, the Angle(J,C,K) suggests that point C is part of the diagram. So perhaps there's a point C which is the center of the circle. Let me try to clarify this.

Let me re-express the given information:

- There's a circle named C. 
- Points A, J, K are on this circle.
- Line AJ is a diameter of circle C. Therefore, the center of the circle is the midpoint of AJ. Let's call the center O. But the problem refers to the angle as Angle(J,C,K), where C is a point. This suggests that point C is the center of the circle. Therefore, the circle's center is point C. So, point C is the center of circle C. That makes sense. So, the circle is named C, and its center is point C. Therefore, AJ is a diameter of the circle centered at C. Hence, points A and J are on the circle, and C is the center. So, AC and JC are radii of the circle. Given that the diameter is AJ, so the length of AJ is twice the radius. The diameter is given as 15 units. Therefore, the radius r = 15 / 2 = 7.5 units.

Now, the angle in question is Angle(J,C,K), which is the angle at point C (the center) between points J and K. So, angle JCK is 105 degrees. Since C is the center, and J and K are points on the circle, the segments CJ and CK are both radii of the circle. Therefore, triangle JCK is an isosceles triangle with sides CJ = CK = r = 7.5. The angle at C is 105 degrees. The question asks for the length of arc JK, denoted as $\widehat{JK}$. 

To find the length of arc JK, we can use the formula for arc length: $ s = r \theta $, where θ is the central angle in radians. Alternatively, since we know the measure of the central angle in degrees, we can convert it to radians first. 

First, let's verify the central angle. The central angle corresponding to arc JK is angle JCK, which is given as 105 degrees. So θ = 105°. To convert this to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 105 × π/180. Simplify that: 105 ÷ 180 = 7/12, so θ_rad = (7π)/12 radians. 

Then, arc length s = r × θ_rad = 7.5 × (7π)/12. Let me compute that. 

First calculate 7.5 × 7 = 52.5. Then divide by 12: 52.5 / 12 = 4.375. Multiply by π: 4.375 × π ≈ 4.375 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 4 × π is about 12.5664, and 0.375 × π ≈ 1.178. Adding them gives approximately 12.5664 + 1.178 ≈ 13.7444. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 13.74. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 13.74. So that should be the correct answer. 

But let me double-check my steps. 

First, confirming the diameter is 15, so radius is 7.5. Correct. Central angle is 105 degrees. Arc length formula is indeed rθ where θ is in radians. Converting 105 degrees to radians: 105 × π/180 = 7π/12. Then, multiplying by radius: 7.5 × 7π/12. Let me compute 7.5 × 7 = 52.5. Divided by 12 is 52.5 / 12 = 4.375. Multiply by π: 4.375 × π ≈ 13.744... which rounds to 13.74. So yes, answer B. 

Therefore, the correct choice is B.
