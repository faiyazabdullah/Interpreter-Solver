Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything given.

We have points A, B, C, D. There are several lines mentioned: AB, BC, AC, AD, BD, DC. So these points form some triangles. Specifically, there are three triangles mentioned: ABD, ABC? Wait, no, the triangles listed are Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C). Wait, but looking at the lines, maybe those triangles are formed by connecting those points. Also, there are angles mentioned: Angle(A,B,D), Angle(A,D,C), Angle(A,D,B), Angle(D,A,C). And some right angles: RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)) and RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)). 

Also, there are length equalities: Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 6x), Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 36), Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), x), Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), Add(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,C)))), and Similar(Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C)).

So the goal is to find x. The options are A. 6, B. 3√6, C. 12, D. 6√6.

First, let me try to visualize or sketch the figure. Points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, AC, AD, BD, DC. So point A connected to B, D, and C. Point B connected to A, C, D. Point D connected to A, B, C. Point C connected to B, D, A? Wait, Line(B,C) exists, so BC is a line. Then Line(D,C) exists, so DC is another line. So perhaps points B, D, C are connected via BD and DC, making BC as a combination?

Also, since Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C), and Triangle(A,B,C) are mentioned. Wait, Triangle(A,B,C) would require lines AB, BC, and AC. But since we have lines AB, BC, and AC, that triangle exists. Similarly, Triangle(A,B,D) has sides AB, BD, AD. Triangle(A,D,C) has AD, DC, AC. 

Now, the angles mentioned: Angle(A,B,D) is the angle at B between AB and BD. Since it's a right angle, that means triangle ABD has a right angle at B. Similarly, Angle(A,D,C) is a right angle, so triangle ADC has a right angle at D. Wait, no—angle(A,D,C) would be the angle at D between AD and DC. So if that's a right angle, then triangle ADC is right-angled at D.

Additionally, there's similarity between Triangle(A,B,D) and Triangle(A,D,C). So triangle ABD ~ triangle ADC. Let me note that down.

Let me write down the given information more formally.

Given:

1. Triangles: ABD, ADC, and ABC (though ABC may not be directly used).
2. Points: A, B, C, D.
3. Lines: AB, BC, AC, AD, BD, DC.
4. Angles: ∠ABD is right, ∠ADC is right.
5. Lengths:
   - BD = 6x
   - AD = 36
   - DC = x
   - BC = BD + DC = 6x + x = 7x
6. Triangles ABD and ADC are similar.

Since triangles ABD and ADC are similar, their corresponding angles are equal and their sides are proportional. Let me recall the order of similarity. The similarity is stated as Triangle(A,B,D) ~ Triangle(A,D,C). So vertex A corresponds to A, B corresponds to D, and D corresponds to C. Therefore, the correspondence is A → A, B → D, D → C. So the order is ABD ~ ADC.

Therefore, the ratio of sides should be consistent. Let me think about the sides of the two triangles.

In triangle ABD, the sides are AB, BD, AD. In triangle ADC, the sides are AD, DC, AC. Because of the similarity, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.

But first, let's confirm which sides correspond. Since the order is ABD ~ ADC, then side AB corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to DC, and AD corresponds to AC.

Wait, let me check. For similar triangles, the order of the vertices matters. So if Triangle ABD ~ Triangle ADC, then:

Vertex A in ABD corresponds to Vertex A in ADC.

Vertex B in ABD corresponds to Vertex D in ADC.

Vertex D in ABD corresponds to Vertex C in ADC.

Therefore, the sides opposite these vertices:

In Triangle ABD:

- Side opposite A is BD.

- Side opposite B is AD.

- Side opposite D is AB.

In Triangle ADC:

- Side opposite A is DC.

- Side opposite D is AC.

- Side opposite C is AD.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the order of the letters. For similar triangles, the order of the letters gives the correspondence. So AB corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to DC, and DA corresponds to CA.

Therefore:

AB / AD = BD / DC = AD / CA.

So the ratio of AB to AD equals BD to DC equals AD to CA.

So, let's denote the ratios. Let me assign variables where possible.

We know BD = 6x, DC = x. So BD/DC = 6x/x = 6. Therefore, the ratio of AB/AD = BD/DC = 6. So AB / AD = 6. We also know AD = 36, so AB = 6 * AD = 6*36 = 216. Hmm, but do we know AB? Not yet. However, we might need to find relations between other sides.

Also, the third ratio is AD / CA = same ratio. So AD / CA = 6. Hence, CA = AD / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6. Wait, but CA is the same as AC. So AC = 6? Let me check that again.

Wait, the ratio AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC. So since BD/DC is 6, then AB/AD = 6, and AD/AC = 6. Therefore, AC = AD / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6. So AC = 6. But wait, AC is a side of triangle ABC. Also, BC is given as 7x (since BC = BD + DC = 6x + x = 7x). 

Now, considering triangle ABC, which has sides AB, BC, AC. We have AC = 6, BC = 7x, and AB = 216 (from earlier). But that seems very large compared to AC=6. Maybe there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe my correspondence is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the similarity is different. Let me double-check the correspondence. The similarity is Triangle ABD ~ Triangle ADC. So the order of the vertices is ABD ~ ADC. That implies that angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC. So angle BAD corresponds to angle DAC. Wait, but angle at A in triangle ABD is angle BAD, and in triangle ADC, angle at A is angle DAC. So if they are similar, then angle BAD = angle DAC. Which would imply that AD bisects angle BAC? Or something like that. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me consider the order of the triangles. When we say Triangle ABD ~ Triangle ADC, the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. So A→A, B→D, D→C. So angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC. So angle BAD corresponds to angle DAC. Therefore, angle BAD = angle DAC. Thus, AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. 

But maybe instead of getting bogged down in angles, focus on the sides. So in triangle ABD and triangle ADC, the sides opposite the corresponding angles are in proportion. So:

Side AB (opposite angle D in triangle ABD) corresponds to side AD (opposite angle D in triangle ADC)? Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me label the sides properly.

In triangle ABD:

- AB is one side.

- BD is another side.

- AD is the third side.

In triangle ADC:

- AD is one side.

- DC is another side.

- AC is the third side.

Since the similarity is ABD ~ ADC, the order of the vertices implies that AB corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to DC, and AD corresponds to AC. So:

AB / AD = BD / DC = AD / AC.

So AB / AD = BD / DC. As before, BD is 6x, DC is x, so BD/DC = 6. Therefore AB / AD = 6 => AB = 6 * AD = 6 * 36 = 216.

Then, AD / AC = same ratio, which is 6. Therefore, AD / AC = 6 => AC = AD / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6. So AC = 6.

Now, considering triangle ABC, which has sides AB = 216, BC = 7x, and AC = 6. Wait, but triangle inequality says that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Here, AC + BC = 6 + 7x. This needs to be greater than AB = 216. So 6 + 7x > 216 => 7x > 210 => x > 30. But none of the answer choices are above 30 except D, which is 6√6 ≈ 14.69... Wait, that doesn't make sense. So this suggests an inconsistency. Therefore, my assumption about the correspondence of the similar triangles must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps Triangle ABD ~ Triangle ACD instead? Or maybe the order is different. Let me re-examine the similarity statement: Similar(Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C)). So the first triangle is ABD, second is ADC. So the correspondence is A→A, B→D, D→C. Therefore, AB corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to DC, AD corresponds to AC. But that leads to the contradiction above. So maybe my mistake lies elsewhere.

Wait, but maybe the triangles are similar in a different way. Let me check the angles. Given that angle ABD is a right angle (as per RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B))), which is angle at B. Wait, Angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D? No, the angle notation is typically the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D between points A, D, B. Wait, but the problem states RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)), which would mean that angle at D is a right angle. Wait, but earlier I thought angle ABD was a right angle. Let me clarify.

The angle names:

Angle(A,B,D): this is the angle at B between points A, B, D. So angle at B, between BA and BD. So that's angle ABD. And it's a right angle. So triangle ABD has a right angle at B.

Similarly, Angle(A,D,C) is the angle at D between points A, D, C. So angle ADC, which is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ADC has a right angle at D.

So both triangles ABD and ADC are right-angled. Moreover, they are similar. So similar right-angled triangles. 

Let me consider triangle ABD: right-angled at B. So legs are AB and BD, hypotenuse AD. Similarly, triangle ADC is right-angled at D, so legs are AD and DC, hypotenuse AC.

Since they are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Now, because they are right triangles, the ratios of their legs should be equal. Let's see.

For triangle ABD: legs AB and BD, hypotenuse AD.

For triangle ADC: legs AD and DC, hypotenuse AC.

Since they are similar, the ratio of AB/AD = AD/DC. Because in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. Let me think.

In triangle ABD and triangle ADC, since they are similar, the ratio of AB to AD (which are corresponding sides) equals the ratio of AD to DC (another pair of corresponding sides). Because in triangle ABD, AB and BD are legs; in triangle ADC, AD and DC are legs. So the ratio of AB/AD = BD/DC. Wait, but since they're similar, the ratio of AB to AD should be equal to the ratio of BD to DC. Wait, maybe I need to set up proportions correctly.

Let me think of the correspondence. If triangle ABD ~ triangle ADC, then the order of the vertices defines the correspondence. So A corresponds to A, B corresponds to D, D corresponds to C. So angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC. Therefore, the sides adjacent to angle A in each triangle correspond. In triangle ABD, the sides adjacent to angle A are AB and AD. In triangle ADC, the sides adjacent to angle A are AD and AC. Therefore, AB corresponds to AD, and AD corresponds to AC. Therefore, AB/AD = AD/AC. Hence, AB/AD = AD/AC ⇒ AB × AC = AD².

But we also know that in triangle ABD, which is right-angled at B, we can apply Pythagoras: AB² + BD² = AD². Similarly, in triangle ADC, right-angled at D: AD² + DC² = AC².

So combining these equations. From the similarity ratio, AB × AC = AD². From Pythagoras in triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD². From triangle ADC: AD² + DC² = AC².

Let me substitute AC from the similarity equation into the Pythagorean equation for ADC. 

From similarity: AB × AC = AD² ⇒ AC = AD² / AB.

Substitute into ADC's Pythagorean equation:

AD² + DC² = (AD² / AB)^2.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe express AC in terms of AD and AB, then plug into the other equation.

Alternatively, let's work with the given lengths. We know BD = 6x, DC = x, AD = 36. Let's denote BD = 6x, DC = x. Also, BC = BD + DC = 7x.

Let me write down the equations:

From triangle ABD (right-angled at B):

AB² + BD² = AD² → AB² + (6x)² = 36² → AB² + 36x² = 1296 → Equation (1)

From triangle ADC (right-angled at D):

AD² + DC² = AC² → 36² + x² = AC² → AC² = 1296 + x² → Equation (2)

From similarity of triangles ABD and ADC: AB/AD = AD/AC. So AB × AC = AD² → AB × AC = 36² = 1296 → Equation (3)

So substituting Equation (2) into Equation (3):

AB × sqrt(1296 + x²) = 1296 → AB = 1296 / sqrt(1296 + x²)

Now, from Equation (1):

AB² = 1296 - 36x² → AB = sqrt(1296 - 36x²)

So setting the two expressions for AB equal:

sqrt(1296 - 36x²) = 1296 / sqrt(1296 + x²)

Square both sides to eliminate square roots:

(1296 - 36x²) = (1296²) / (1296 + x²)

Multiply both sides by (1296 + x²):

(1296 - 36x²)(1296 + x²) = 1296²

Expand left side:

1296*1296 + 1296*x² - 36x²*1296 - 36x^4 = 1296²

Subtract 1296² from both sides:

1296*x² - 36x²*1296 - 36x^4 = 0

Factor out 1296x²:

1296x²(1 - 36) - 36x^4 = 0 → Wait, let me compute term by term:

Left side after subtraction: 1296x² - 36*1296x² - 36x^4 = 0

Combine like terms:

(1296x² - 36*1296x²) - 36x^4 = 0 → factor 1296x²(1 - 36) - 36x^4 = 0

Which simplifies to:

1296x²(-35) - 36x^4 = 0 → Multiply through by -1:

35*1296x² + 36x^4 = 0

Divide both sides by x² (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't):

35*1296 + 36x² = 0 → 36x² = -35*1296 → x² negative? That can't be. Contradiction!

This suggests that there's a mistake in my setup. Where did I go wrong?

Let me trace back. The similarity ratio. Earlier, I assumed AB/AD = AD/AC, leading to AB×AC = AD². But maybe the correspondence of the similar triangles is different. Perhaps the similarity is between ABD and ADC such that AB corresponds to AD, BD corresponds to DC, and AD corresponds to AC. Wait, but that led to an impossible equation. Alternatively, maybe the similarity is ABD ~ ADC with a different correspondence.

Alternative approach: since both triangles are right-angled, maybe the legs of one correspond to the hypotenuse of the other? Let me think. For example, in triangle ABD, legs AB and BD, hypotenuse AD. In triangle ADC, legs AD and DC, hypotenuse AC. If they are similar, then the ratio of the legs of one triangle should equal the ratio of the legs of the other. But since they are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be consistent.

Suppose triangle ABD ~ triangle ADC. So the ratio of AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC. Wait, earlier I tried that and got contradictions. But maybe I made a miscalculation during substitution. Let me try again.

Let me take AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC.

We have BD = 6x, DC = x → BD/DC = 6. So AB/AD = 6 → AB = 6*AD = 6*36 = 216. And AD/AC = 6 → AC = AD / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6.

Now, applying Pythagoras to triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → 216² + (6x)^2 = 36² → 46656 + 36x² = 1296 → 36x² = 1296 - 46656 = -45360 → x² negative. Again, impossible! So there's a fundamental flaw here. What's wrong?

Ah! Wait, triangle ABD is right-angled at B, so its legs are AB and BD, hypotenuse AD. So according to Pythagoras: AB² + BD² = AD². But if AB is 216, BD is 6x, AD is 36, then 216² + (6x)^2 = 36² → which is impossible because 216² is much larger than 36². So this suggests that the correspondence of the similar triangles is incorrect. 

Perhaps the similarity is not between AB/AD = BD/DC, but rather AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC, but with different assignments. Let me think again about the correspondence. Maybe the triangles are similar in a different order. Suppose triangle ABD ~ triangle DCA instead? Or triangle ABD ~ triangle CAD?

Let me try a different correspondence. Suppose triangle ABD ~ triangle DCA. So vertices A→D, B→C, D→A. Then, the sides would correspond as AB corresponds to DC, BD corresponds to CA, AD corresponds to AD. Wait, but this seems arbitrary. Alternatively, since both are right-angled, maybe the legs of one triangle are proportional to the legs of the other.

Let me think: triangle ABD is right-angled at B, so legs AB and BD, hypotenuse AD. Triangle ADC is right-angled at D, legs AD and DC, hypotenuse AC. If they are similar, then the ratios of their corresponding legs must be equal. So either:

Case 1: AB/AD = AD/DC (corresponding legs of ABD and ADC).

Or Case 2: AB/DC = AD/DC (unlikely), or other possibilities.

Wait, if they are similar, then the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Since both are right-angled, the order of the sides matters. Let me assume that the legs of ABD correspond to the legs of ADC. So AB (leg of ABD) corresponds to AD (leg of ADC), and BD (other leg of ABD) corresponds to DC (other leg of ADC). Then the ratio AB/AD = BD/DC. Which is what I had before, leading to AB = 6*AD = 216, which causes the Pythagorean contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe AB corresponds to DC and BD corresponds to AD? Let's try that. So AB/DC = BD/AD. Then AB/DC = BD/AD → AB = (BD/AD)*DC. Substituting numbers: BD=6x, DC=x, AD=36 → AB = (6x / 36) * x = (x/6)x = x²/6.

Then, from Pythagoras in triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → (x²/6)^2 + (6x)^2 = 36^2 → x^4 / 36 + 36x² = 1296.

Multiply all terms by 36 to eliminate denominator:

x^4 + 1296x² = 46656

Let me rearrange:

x^4 + 1296x² - 46656 = 0

Let me set y = x²:

y² + 1296y - 46656 = 0

Solve quadratic equation:

y = [-1296 ± sqrt(1296² + 4*1*46656)] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

1296² + 4*46656 = 1679616 + 186624 = 1866240

Wait, sqrt(1866240)... Let me calculate sqrt(1866240). Let me factor:

Note that 46656 is 36^3 = 46656. Let me check if 1866240 is divisible by 36^2 = 1296.

Dividing 1866240 ÷ 1296:

1296 * 1440 = 1296*(1400 + 40) = 1296*1400 + 1296*40 = 1,814,400 + 51,840 = 1,866,240. Yes! So sqrt(1296 * 1440) = sqrt(1296) * sqrt(1440) = 36 * sqrt(1440). Simplify sqrt(1440): 1440 = 144 * 10 → sqrt(144*10) = 12√10. So total sqrt is 36*12√10 = 432√10.

Thus, y = [-1296 ± 432√10]/2. Since y = x² must be positive, we take the positive root:

y = (-1296 + 432√10)/2 = -648 + 216√10. Let's approximate √10 ≈ 3.162 → 216*3.162 ≈ 683. So -648 + 683 ≈ 35. So y ≈ 35, hence x ≈ sqrt(35) ≈ 5.916. None of the answer choices match this. Also, this seems too vague. Plus, the original equation may have errors.

Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the correspondence. Let me try another approach.

Since both triangles ABD and ADC are right-angled, and they are similar, their corresponding sides must be in proportion. Let me denote the sides:

For triangle ABD: legs AB and BD, hypotenuse AD.

For triangle ADC: legs AD and DC, hypotenuse AC.

Since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal. Let's suppose that the ratio of AB/AD = AD/DC. This would mean that AB/AD = AD/DC → AB * DC = AD². 

We know AD = 36, DC = x, so AB * x = 36² → AB = 36² / x = 1296 / x.

Now, apply Pythagoras to triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → (1296/x)^2 + (6x)^2 = 36².

Compute this:

(1296²)/(x²) + 36x² = 1296.

Multiply both sides by x²:

1296² + 36x^4 = 1296x².

Rearrange:

36x^4 - 1296x² + 1296² = 0.

Divide all terms by 36:

x^4 - 36x² + 36² = 0.

Let y = x²:

y² - 36y + 1296 = 0.

Solving this quadratic:

y = [36 ± sqrt(36² - 4*1*1296)] / 2.

Calculate discriminant: 1296 - 4*1296 = 1296(1 - 4) = -3*1296 < 0. No real solutions. Again, contradiction.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption of the correspondence is still wrong. Maybe the similarity involves the hypotenuses? Let me think: perhaps triangle ABD ~ triangle DAC, with AB corresponding to DA, BD corresponding to AC, and AD corresponding to DC? Let's try.

If triangle ABD ~ triangle DAC, then AB/DA = BD/AC = AD/DC.

So AB/DA = BD/AC → AB = (BD/AC)*DA. And AD/DC = same ratio.

Let me denote DA = 36, DC = x, BD = 6x.

From AD/DC = AB/DA → 36/x = AB/36 → AB = 36*(36/x) = 1296/x.

Then, from BD/AC = AB/DA → 6x / AC = (1296/x)/36 → 6x / AC = 36/x → Cross-multiplying: 6x * x = 36 * AC → 6x² = 36 AC → AC = x² / 6.

Now, apply Pythagoras to triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → (1296/x)^2 + (6x)^2 = 36^2.

Same equation as before, leading to no real solution. So this approach also fails.

Maybe the issue is that the similarity is not between the legs but involving the hypotenuses? Let me try another approach. Let me consider the fact that both triangles are right-angled and similar, so their angles are the same. Let me denote the angles.

In triangle ABD, right-angled at B. Let’s call angle at A as α, angle at D as β. So α + β = 90°.

In triangle ADC, right-angled at D. Let’s call angle at A as γ, angle at C as δ. So γ + δ = 90°.

Since the triangles are similar, their angles must match. So angle α in ABD corresponds to angle γ in ADC, and angle β corresponds to δ.

But without knowing which angles correspond, it's hard to proceed. However, since both triangles share point A, perhaps angle at A is common? Wait, in triangle ABD, angle at A is between AB and AD. In triangle ADC, angle at A is between AD and AC. If they are similar, then these angles could be equal. So angle BAD = angle DAC, implying that AD bisects angle BAC. 

Assuming that, then angle BAD = angle DAC. Let me denote this angle as θ. So in triangle ABD, angle at A is θ, and in triangle ADC, angle at A is θ. 

In triangle ABD (right-angled at B), the angles are θ at A, 90° at B, and angle at D is 90° - θ.

In triangle ADC (right-angled at D), angles are θ at A, 90° at D, and angle at C is 90° - θ.

Since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Let's consider the sides:

In triangle ABD, sides: AB (opposite angle D), BD (opposite angle A), AD (hypotenuse).

In triangle ADC, sides: AD (opposite angle C), DC (opposite angle A), AC (hypotenuse).

So, if angle at A is θ in both, then the sides opposite these angles would be BD in ABD and DC in ADC. So BD/DC = AB/AD = AD/AC.

Wait, this brings us back to the earlier equation: AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC. Which led to contradictions earlier. But why?

Let me try plugging in the known values again. 

We have BD = 6x, DC = x. So BD/DC = 6x/x = 6. So AB/AD = 6 → AB = 6*AD = 6*36 = 216. And AD/AC = 6 → AC = AD/6 = 36/6 = 6.

Now, apply Pythagoras to triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → 216² + (6x)^2 = 36² → 46656 + 36x² = 1296 → 36x² = 1296 - 46656 = -45360 → x² = -1260. Impossible.

Clearly, there's a contradiction, suggesting that our initial assumptions about the similarity correspondence are incorrect. 

Wait, but the problem states that Similar(Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C)). So it's definitely those two triangles. Maybe the error lies in assuming that the correspondence is A→A, B→D, D→C. Maybe it's a different correspondence. Let me try swapping some vertices.

What if the similarity is ABD ~ DCA? So A→D, B→C, D→A. Then, the sides would be AB corresponds to DC, BD corresponds to CA, AD corresponds to AD.

So AB/DC = BD/CA = AD/AD = 1. So AD/AD = 1, so the ratio is 1. Hence, AB/DC = 1 → AB = DC = x. And BD/CA = 1 → BD = CA → 6x = CA. 

Now, from triangle ABD (right-angled at B): AB² + BD² = AD² → x² + (6x)^2 = 36² → x² + 36x² = 1296 → 37x² = 1296 → x² = 1296/37 → x = sqrt(1296/37) = 36/sqrt(37) ≈ 5.86. Not matching any answer choices. But let's check if this fits with other conditions.

Also, from the similarity, CA = BD = 6x. But CA is also part of triangle ABC. We know BC = 7x. So in triangle ABC, sides AB = x, BC = 7x, and AC = 6x. Let's check triangle inequality: AB + AC > BC → x + 6x > 7x → 7x > 7x → false. Equality holds, which is invalid. Hence, this is also impossible.

Another possibility: maybe the similarity is ABD ~ CDA. Let me try this. So A→C, B→D, D→A. So AB corresponds to CD, BD corresponds to DA, AD corresponds to AC.

So AB/CD = BD/DA = AD/AC.

Given CD = x (since DC = x, CD is same as DC), BD = 6x, DA = 36, AD = 36.

So AB/x = 6x/36 = x/6. Hence, AB/x = x/6 → AB = x²/6.

Also, AD/AC = x/6 → 36/AC = x/6 → AC = 36*6/x = 216/x.

Now, apply Pythagoras to triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → (x²/6)^2 + (6x)^2 = 36^2 → x^4/36 + 36x² = 1296.

Multiply through by 36: x^4 + 1296x² = 46656.

Let y = x²: y² + 1296y - 46656 = 0.

Solving: y = [-1296 ± sqrt(1296^2 + 4*46656)] / 2.

As before, this leads to a positive solution y = [-1296 + sqrt(1296^2 + 186624)] / 2. Wait, let me compute the discriminant again.

Discriminant = 1296^2 + 4*46656 = 1679616 + 186624 = 1866240. As before, sqrt(1866240) = 1366.2... Wait, earlier calculation said it's 432√10, which is approximately 432*3.162 ≈ 1366. So y = (-1296 + 1366)/2 ≈ 70/2 = 35. So x² = 35 → x = √35 ≈ 5.916. Still no match with the answer choices. 

But the answer choices are A. 6, B. 3√6 ≈ 7.348, C. 12, D. 6√6 ≈ 14.698. None of these match √35. So this suggests that there's a missing piece or a miscalculation.

Wait, let's revisit the given predicates. Are there any other relationships I haven't considered? Let me check the given predicates again.

There's also the equality of BC = Add(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,C))) → BC = BD + DC = 6x + x = 7x. Also, there's the triangle ABC. Maybe I should look at triangle ABC and apply Pythagoras or other relations.

If I can find AC, AB, and BC, then perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines or something. But I need more info. Let me think.

Earlier, from the similarity, if I assume a certain correspondence, I get contradictions, but maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach: since both triangles ABD and ADC are right-angled and similar, their sides must satisfy certain ratios. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k. So, if triangle ABD ~ triangle ADC with ratio k, then corresponding sides are in ratio k.

Let me assume that the hypotenuse of ABD (AD) corresponds to the leg of ADC (AD or DC?). Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about the sides.

Let me denote for triangle ABD: right-angled at B, so sides AB, BD, hypotenuse AD.

For triangle ADC: right-angled at D, sides AD, DC, hypotenuse AC.

If they are similar, then the ratio of their corresponding sides must be equal. Let's assume that the hypotenuse of ABD (AD) corresponds to the hypotenuse of ADC (AC). Then, the ratio of similarity is AD/AC. So, the other sides must also be in this ratio.

So, AB/AD = BD/DC = AD/AC.

This is the same as before, leading to AB = (AD/AC) * AD = AD²/AC, and BD/DC = AD/AC → 6x/x = AD/AC → 6 = AD/AC → AC = AD/6 = 36/6 = 6.

Then, from triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → AB² + (6x)^2 = 36^2 → AB = sqrt(36² - 36x²) = 36√(1 - x²).

But also, from the similarity, AB = AD² / AC = 36² / 6 = 1296 / 6 = 216. So 36√(1 - x²) = 216 → √(1 - x²) = 6 → 1 - x² = 36 → x² = -35. Again, impossible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the given predicates, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the similarity. Let me check if there's any other possible interpretation of the similarity.

Wait, the problem states Similar(Triangle(A,B,D), Triangle(A,D,C)). Could it be that the similarity is not between the triangles as whole, but in a different order? Like, perhaps Triangle ABD ~ Triangle DCA? Let me try this.

So, triangle ABD ~ triangle DCA. This would mean that the correspondence is A→D, B→C, D→A. So, the sides AB corresponds to DC, BD corresponds to CA, AD corresponds to AD.

So, AB/DC = BD/CA = AD/AD = 1.

So, AB/DC = 1 → AB = DC = x.

BD/CA = 1 → BD = CA → 6x = CA.

From triangle ABD: AB² + BD² = AD² → x² + (6x)^2 = 36² → x² + 36x² = 1296 → 37x² = 1296 → x² = 1296/37 → x = 36/sqrt(37). 

Now, check if this satisfies other conditions. CA = 6x, and BC = 7x. In triangle ABC, sides AB = x, BC = 7x, and AC = 6x. Check triangle inequality: x + 6x > 7x → 7x > 7x → false. So this is invalid.

Hmm. All paths seem to lead to contradictions. Maybe the error is in assuming that both triangles are right-angled? Let me recheck the given predicates.

The problem states RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)) and RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)). 

Angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D between A, D, B. So it's angle ADB, which is the angle at D in triangle ABD. Wait, but earlier I thought it was at B. Wait, no! The angle notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(A,D,B) is the angle at D between A-D-B. So it's angle ADB, which is part of triangle ABD. So if it's a right angle, then in triangle ABD, angle at D is a right angle. Wait, but previously I thought it was at B. This is a critical mistake!

Oh no! I've been misinterpreting the right angles. Let me correct this.

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)): this is the angle at D, between A, D, B. So in triangle ABD, angle at D is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)) is the angle at D between A, D, C, so in triangle ADC, angle at D is a right angle. Wait, but this changes everything!

So both triangles ABD and ADC are right-angled at D, not at B or at D. Wait, no: Angle(A,D,B) is at D, so triangle ABD has a right angle at D. Similarly, Angle(A,D,C) is at D, so triangle ADC has a right angle at D. Wait, but then both triangles ABD and ADC are right-angled at D, which is the same point. So both triangles share the right angle at D. This changes the entire scenario.

So, let me restart with this correction.

Triangles ABD and ADC are both right-angled at D. So:

- In triangle ABD: right-angled at D, so legs are AD and DB, hypotenuse AB.

- In triangle ADC: right-angled at D, so legs are AD and DC, hypotenuse AC.

Given that, and that they are similar. Let's analyze.

Since both are right-angled at D, their similarity would mean that the other angles are equal. So, angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC, or angle at B in ABD corresponds to angle at C in ADC.

Let me denote the triangles:

Triangle ABD: right-angled at D, with legs AD and DB, hypotenuse AB.

Triangle ADC: right-angled at D, with legs AD and DC, hypotenuse AC.

Since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Let's determine the correspondence.

If they are similar, the order of the vertices must match. Given the similarity is Triangle ABD ~ Triangle ADC, the correspondence is A→A, B→D, D→C. So, angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC. So, the legs adjacent to angle A in each triangle should correspond.

In triangle ABD, the legs adjacent to angle A are AD and AB? No, wait: triangle ABD has right angle at D, so the legs are AD and DB, and hypotenuse AB. The angle at A is between AD and AB. In triangle ADC, right-angled at D, the legs are AD and DC, hypotenuse AC. The angle at A is between AD and AC. So if the triangles are similar, the angle at A in ABD corresponds to angle at A in ADC. Hence, the sides adjacent to angle A in each triangle should be in proportion.

In triangle ABD, the sides adjacent to angle A are AD and AB (wait, no: angle at A is between AD and AB? No, in triangle ABD, the sides are AD, DB, AB. The angle at A is between AD and AB? No, let me draw mentally: points A, B, D. Right angle at D. So AD and DB are the legs. The angle at A is between AD and AB. Wait, AB is the hypotenuse. So the angle at A is between AD (one leg) and AB (hypotenuse). Similarly, in triangle ADC, angle at A is between AD (leg) and AC (hypotenuse). So for similarity, the ratio of AD/AB (in ABD) should equal AD/AC (in ADC). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me use the standard method for similar right triangles.

In similar right triangles, the ratio of corresponding legs is equal. Since both are right-angled at D, the legs are AD and DB for ABD, and AD and DC for ADC. So if they are similar, the ratio of AD/DB = AD/DC, or DB/AD = DC/AD, depending on correspondence.

Wait, let me think. If triangle ABD ~ triangle ADC, then the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Since both are right-angled at D, the legs of one correspond to the legs of the other. So, in triangle ABD, legs are AD and DB; in triangle ADC, legs are AD and DC. So, the ratio of AD/AD = DB/DC. This implies 1 = DB/DC → DB = DC. But DB is 6x, DC is x
