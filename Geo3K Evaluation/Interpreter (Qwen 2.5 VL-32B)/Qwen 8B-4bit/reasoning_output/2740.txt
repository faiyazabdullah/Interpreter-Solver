Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a circle S with points P, Q, R, T, and another point S. The question is about finding the measure of arc PQ given that the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees. The answer choices are A to D.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

- Points P, Q, R, T, and S are defined.
- Lines connecting P-Q, Q-R, P-R, Q-S, Q-T, T-R, S-T.
- Point P lies on the circle centered at S.
- Similarly, Q, R lie on the same circle.
- Lines QS, RS, PS are radii of the circle S because they're mentioned as IsRadiusOf.
- PR is a chord of the circle since it's IsChordOf.
- T is the midpoint of PR, so PT equals TR.
- QT is perpendicular to PR.
- The length of TR is 6 units.
- The measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees.
- Angle QTS is a right angle.

So, the main goal is to find the measure of arc PQ. Given that the entire arc PQR measures 98 degrees. Wait, arcs in a circle... So, arc PQR would be the arc from P to R passing through Q. Therefore, the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees. Since points P, Q, R are on the circle, and PR is a chord, then arc PQR is the major arc if Q is on the opposite side, but maybe not. Wait, depending on where Q is located.

But first, let's recall some circle theorems. The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. Also, inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are half the measure of the central angle. But here, since we have points on the circle and lines, perhaps there are central angles involved.

Given that QS, RS, and PS are radii. So, S is the center of the circle. Therefore, SP, SQ, SR are all radii, so SP = SQ = SR. That means triangle SPR has two sides SP and SR as radii, making it an isosceles triangle? Wait, but PR is a chord. Also, T is the midpoint of PR, so PT = TR = 6, as given. So PR is twice TR, so PR = 12. Then, since T is the midpoint of PR and QT is perpendicular to PR, triangle QTR is a right triangle?

Wait, QT is perpendicular to PR, so angle QTP is 90 degrees. And since T is the midpoint of PR, then QT is the median of triangle SPR, but also perpendicular to PR. In a circle, if a line from the center is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. But here, QT is not necessarily from the center unless Q is the center. Wait, but S is the center. Wait, Q is on the circle, so SQ is a radius. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. Since S is the center, and Q is on the circle, then SQ is a radius. So, if we have a chord PR, then the perpendicular from the center S to the chord PR would pass through the midpoint of PR. However, in this case, QT is perpendicular to PR and T is the midpoint. So does that mean that Q lies on the line perpendicular to PR at T? Because QT is perpendicular to PR and T is the midpoint. But if S were the center, then the line from S to T would be perpendicular to PR. But here, QT is perpendicular to PR. So unless S and Q are aligned such that S, T, Q are colinear? Or maybe Q is not the center. Wait, but S is the center.

Let me try to visualize this. There's a circle with center S. Points P, Q, R are on the circumference. PR is a chord. T is the midpoint of PR, so ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR. But according to the given, QT is perpendicular to PR. So if QT is perpendicular to PR, then Q lies somewhere such that the line QT is perpendicular to PR. But since T is the midpoint of PR, and S is the center, then ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR. Therefore, if QT is also perpendicular to PR, then Q must lie along the line ST. Because the only line perpendicular to PR at T is the line containing ST. Hence, Q lies on ST. Wait, but Q is on the circle. Therefore, Q is the intersection of ST with the circle. So, S is the center, T is the midpoint of PR, and Q is on ST extended beyond T to the circle. Wait, but if T is the midpoint of PR, then ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR. So, if Q is on ST, then SQ is a radius. But since Q is on the circle, then SQ = radius. Also, since T is the midpoint of PR, then ST is the distance from the center to the chord PR. 

Moreover, we know that the length of TR is 6, so PR is 12. Let me note that. Also, since QT is perpendicular to PR, triangle QTR is a right triangle with right angle at T. So, QT^2 + TR^2 = QR^2. Wait, but we don't know QT's length yet. Alternatively, since T is the midpoint of PR, and QT is perpendicular to PR, then maybe we can relate QT to other elements.

Also, given that angle QTS is a right angle. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(Q,T,S)). So angle at T between Q and S is a right angle. So, Triangle QTS is a right triangle with right angle at T. So, QT is perpendicular to TS. But earlier, QT is perpendicular to PR. Therefore, TS is parallel to PR? No, wait. If QT is perpendicular to PR and also perpendicular to TS, then PR and TS are parallel? Wait, if QT is perpendicular to both PR and TS, then PR and TS must be parallel? Wait, no. If QT is perpendicular to PR and QT is also perpendicular to TS, then PR and TS are both perpendicular to the same line QT, hence they are parallel to each other. So, PR || TS. But T is the midpoint of PR, and S is the center. So TS is part of the line from the center S to the midpoint T of PR. Which, in a circle, is the perpendicular bisector of the chord PR. Therefore, TS is indeed perpendicular to PR. Hence, QT is also perpendicular to PR, so QT is along the direction of TS. Thus, Q lies on the line TS. Therefore, Q is on the line TS, which passes through the center S. Therefore, Q is on the line extending from T through S. But since Q is on the circle, then SQ is a radius. Therefore, the distance from S to Q is the radius. Also, since T is the midpoint of PR, and QT is perpendicular to PR, then QT is part of the line ST, which connects the center to the midpoint of the chord PR. Therefore, Q lies on the line ST, but since Q is on the circle, then Q could be either on one side or the other of T. Depending on whether T is inside the circle or not. Wait, T is the midpoint of PR, which is a chord. So T is inside the circle. Therefore, the line ST goes from the center S through T to the other side. So Q is on the extension of ST beyond T, or on the other side. Wait, but if Q is on the circle, then SQ is a radius. Let me consider coordinates to make this clearer.

Let me assign coordinates. Let me place the center S at (0,0). Let me assume PR is horizontal for simplicity. Since T is the midpoint of PR and QT is perpendicular to PR, then QT is vertical. Let me suppose PR is horizontal. Let me set coordinates such that T is at (a, b) but since PR is horizontal and T is the midpoint, let me simplify. Suppose PR is horizontal, lying along the x-axis. Let me set T at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Wait, but S is the center of the circle. Let me adjust. Maybe better to set up coordinates with S at (h, k). Alternatively, let me take T as the origin (0,0). Since PR is horizontal and T is the midpoint, let me say P is (-6, 0) and R is (6, 0), so that PR has length 12, and T is at (0,0). Then, since QT is perpendicular to PR, which is horizontal, so QT is vertical. So Q lies somewhere along the y-axis. But since Q is on the circle centered at S, and QT is vertical. Wait, but where is S located? Since S is the center, and T is the midpoint of PR, which is a chord. The line ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR. So, in this coordinate system, if PR is from (-6,0) to (6,0), then the perpendicular bisector is the y-axis. Therefore, S lies somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote S as (0, c), where c is some constant. Now, since Q is on the circle centered at S, and QT is vertical. Since Q is on the y-axis (because QT is vertical and T is at (0,0)), so Q has coordinates (0, q). Since Q is on the circle centered at S (0,c) with radius r. So the distance from S to Q is |q - c| = r. Also, the distance from S to P should be the same as SQ. Let me compute SP. P is (-6,0), S is (0,c). So SP squared is (6)^2 + (c)^2 = 36 + c². Similarly, SQ squared is (0 - 0)^2 + (q - c)^2 = (q - c)^2. Therefore, 36 + c² = (q - c)^2. Expanding the right side: q² - 2qc + c². So 36 + c² = q² - 2qc + c² → 36 = q² - 2qc → q² - 2qc - 36 = 0. This equation relates q and c.

Additionally, we know that angle QTS is a right angle. Since T is at (0,0), Q is at (0,q), and S is at (0,c). So angle at T between Q and S. Wait, angle QTS is the angle at T between points Q, T, S. So vectors TQ and TS. Vector TQ is Q - T = (0, q) - (0,0) = (0, q). Vector TS is S - T = (0, c) - (0,0) = (0, c). The angle between these two vectors is the angle between (0,q) and (0,c). These are both vertical vectors pointing upwards. So the angle between them is zero degrees if they are in the same direction, or 180 if opposite. But the predicate says it's a right angle. Wait, that seems impossible unless one vector is positive and the other negative. Wait, but if Q is above T and S is also above T, then both vectors are in the same direction. If Q is below T, then TQ would be downward, while TS depends on where S is. Wait, if S is above T, then TS is upward. If Q is below T, then TQ is downward. So the angle between TQ and TS would be 180 degrees if Q is directly opposite to S relative to T. But the problem states that angle QTS is a right angle. Therefore, this suggests that my coordinate assumption may be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in placing the points. Let me check again. The predicate says RightAngle(Angle(Q,T,S)). So the angle at T between points Q, T, S. So vertex at T, with segments TQ and TS. For this angle to be 90 degrees, the vectors TQ and TS must be perpendicular. So their dot product must be zero. In my current setup, TQ is (0, q) and TS is (0, c). Their dot product is 0*0 + q*c = qc. For this to be zero, either q=0 or c=0. But q cannot be 0 because Q is a distinct point from T (since T is the midpoint of PR and Q is another point on the circle). Similarly, if c=0, then S is at (0,0), which is T. But S is the center of the circle; if S coincides with T, then T is the center. But T is the midpoint of PR, so that would imply that PR is a diameter. But then QT is perpendicular to PR, so QT would be a radius. But then Q is on the circle, so SQ would be a radius. But if S is T, then SQ is the same as QT. Wait, this seems conflicting. 

Hmm, there's a contradiction here. My assumption that T is at (0,0) and S is at (0,c) leads to the requirement that qc = 0, which implies either q=0 or c=0. Since Q is not T, q ≠ 0. So c must be 0, implying S is at T. But then S is the center, so T is the center. Therefore, PR is a diameter, since T is the midpoint of PR and S is the center. Therefore, PR is a diameter. Then, QT is perpendicular to PR (which is a diameter), so QT is a radius. But since Q is on the circle, then QT would be a radius, and since T is the center, then QT would be equal to the radius. But then the length of QT would be equal to the radius. But we don't have info on the radius. However, we do know that TR = 6. Since PR is a diameter, PR = 2*radius. Since T is the midpoint, PT = TR = 6, so PR = 12, so radius is 6. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 6. Then, QT is a radius, so QT = 6. But then, since angle QTS is a right angle, and S is the center, which is T. Wait, if S is T, then the angle at T between Q and S would be undefined, because S is T. So something's wrong here. 

This suggests that my initial coordinate setup is flawed. Perhaps my assumption that T is at (0,0) is causing issues. Let me try a different approach. Let me instead consider that S is the center, and T is the midpoint of PR. Then, the line ST is perpendicular to PR. Additionally, QT is perpendicular to PR, so Q lies on the line ST. Therefore, Q is on the line ST. Since Q is on the circle, and S is the center, then SQ is a radius. Also, since T is on ST, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR, then ST is the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord PR. Therefore, QT is a segment from Q to T, which lies on the line ST. 

Now, considering triangle QTS, which is right-angled at T. So, triangle QTS is right-angled at T. Therefore, by Pythagoras: QT² + TS² = QS². But QS is the radius, let's call it r. Also, since T is the midpoint of PR, and PR is a chord, the length of TS can be found using the formula relating the distance from the center to the chord. The formula is: if a chord of length l is at distance d from the center, then l/2 = √(r² - d²). Here, PR is the chord of length 12 (since TR = 6), so l = 12. Then, (l/2)² + d² = r² → (6)² + d² = r² → 36 + d² = r². But d is the distance from the center S to the chord PR, which is the length of ST. Wait, but in this case, since Q is on the line ST, and T is the midpoint of PR, then the distance from S to PR is ST. Wait, no. The distance from S to PR is the length of the perpendicular from S to PR, which is ST, since ST is the perpendicular bisector. Therefore, ST is the distance from S to PR, which we can call d. Then, as per the formula, (PR/2)² + d² = r² → 6² + d² = r². But we also have triangle QTS being right-angled at T. So QT² + ST² = QS². But QS is the radius, so r. Therefore:

QT² + ST² = r²

But from the previous equation, we have 6² + d² = r², where d = ST. Therefore, substituting:

QT² + d² = 6² + d² ⇒ QT² = 36 ⇒ QT = 6.

Therefore, QT = 6. But we also know that in triangle QTS, right-angled at T, QT = 6, and ST = d, and QS = r. So, we have QT = 6, and from the chord length formula, we had r² = 36 + d². Also, since Q is on the circle, SQ = r. But Q is on the line ST, so the position of Q depends on how far it is from S. Let me think about the location of Q. Since T is the midpoint of PR, and Q is on the line ST, then Q can be on either side of T. Let's assume that Q is on the same side of T as S. Wait, but then if S is the center, then moving from T towards S would be towards the center. But if Q is on the line ST, then depending on where Q is, it could be inside or outside the circle. However, since Q is on the circle, then the distance from S to Q must be r. 

Suppose that Q is on the extension of ST beyond T. Then, the distance from S to Q would be ST + TQ. Or if Q is between S and T, then SQ = ST - TQ. Either way, we can write equations. Let me define variables:

Let’s denote ST = d. Then, since QT = 6, and Q is on the line ST, then the distance from S to Q is |ST ± QT|. Depending on the direction. 

Case 1: Q is on the same side of T as S. Then, SQ = ST - TQ if Q is between S and T. But since Q is on the circle, SQ = r. But from before, r² = 36 + d². Also, SQ = |ST - TQ| = |d - 6|. So:

(d - 6)^2 = 36 + d²  
Expanding: d² - 12d + 36 = 36 + d²  
Subtract d² and 36 from both sides: -12d = 0 ⇒ d = 0. But d is the distance from S to PR, which can't be zero unless PR is a diameter, but then T would coincide with S, leading to contradictions as before. So this case isn't valid.

Case 2: Q is on the opposite side of T from S. So, the distance from S to Q is ST + TQ = d + 6. Then:

SQ = d + 6 = r.  
But from earlier, r² = 36 + d². Substituting r = d + 6:

(d + 6)^2 = 36 + d²  
Expand left side: d² + 12d + 36 = 36 + d²  
Subtract d² and 36: 12d = 0 ⇒ d = 0. Again, same contradiction. So this case also doesn't work.

Hmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in the assumptions. Wait, but we derived that QT² = 36, hence QT = 6. How did we get that? From the fact that in triangle QTS, right-angled at T, so QT² + ST² = QS², and from the chord formula, QS² = 36 + ST². Therefore, substituting gives QT² + ST² = 36 + ST² ⇒ QT² = 36 ⇒ QT = 6. So regardless of ST, QT must be 6. So QT = 6. But how does this help us?

We also know that in triangle QTS, right-angled at T, so QT = 6, and ST is the distance from S to the chord PR, which we called d. Also, since Q is on the circle, SQ is the radius r. So, from the chord formula: r² = 36 + d². But also, from triangle QTS: r² = QT² + ST² = 36 + d², which checks out. So this doesn't give new information. So we need more relations to find d or r.

But maybe we can use the arc measure. The measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees. Arc PQR is the arc from P to R passing through Q. In terms of central angles, this corresponds to the central angle ∠PSR. Because the arc PQR spans from P to R via Q, which is the same as the central angle over PR. Wait, but if Q is on the arc PR, then the measure of arc PQR is the measure of arc PR plus arc QR? Wait, no. Actually, arc PQR is just the arc from P to R that includes Q. Since P, Q, R are on the circle, and Q is between P and R along the arc. Wait, but depending on the position of Q, the arc PQR could be minor or major. But the measure is given as 98 degrees, which is less than 180, so likely it's the minor arc. But if Q is between P and R, then arc PQR would be the same as arc PR. Wait, no. If you go from P to Q to R, that's the arc from P to R passing through Q. So it's the same as arc PR. Unless Q is not on the arc PR but on the opposite side. But since Q is on the circle, and PR is a chord, Q could be anywhere. However, given that QT is perpendicular to PR, and Q is on the line ST (the perpendicular bisector of PR), then Q is either on the same line as the center S or diametrically opposed. 

Wait, if Q is on the line ST, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR, then the arc PR would correspond to the central angle ∠PSR. The measure of arc PR is equal to the measure of ∠PSR. But since Q is on the circle, the arc PQ and arc QR would add up to arc PR. Wait, if Q is on the arc PR, then arc PQ + arc QR = arc PR. But the measure of arc PQR is given as 98°, which would be the same as arc PR. So arc PR = 98°, which would mean ∠PSR = 98°, the central angle. But then, if we can find the measure of arc PQ, which would depend on where Q is on arc PR. 

However, without knowing the exact position of Q on arc PR, we need more information. Wait, but maybe there's something else. We know that angle QTS is a right angle. Earlier, we tried to use coordinates but hit a snag. Let me try again with different coordinates.

Let me consider S at (0,0), center. PR is a horizontal chord, T is the midpoint. Let me assume PR is horizontal, so T is at (a,0). Wait, but earlier confusion arose when trying to set T at origin. Let me try setting T at (0,0), PR horizontal, so P=(-6,0), R=(6,0), T=(0,0). Then, the center S lies along the perpendicular bisector of PR, which is the y-axis. So S is at (0,b) for some b. Then, Q is on the line ST, which is the y-axis. So Q is at (0,q) for some q. Since Q is on the circle centered at S(0,b), the radius is the distance from S to P, which is sqrt((6-0)^2 + (0-b)^2) = sqrt(36 + b²). Also, the distance from S to Q must be the same. Q is at (0,q), so distance SQ is |q - b|. Therefore:

sqrt(36 + b²) = |q - b|

Square both sides: 36 + b² = (q - b)^2 = q² - 2bq + b² ⇒ 36 = q² - 2bq ⇒ q² - 2bq - 36 = 0.

Additionally, angle QTS is a right angle. T is at (0,0), Q is at (0,q), S is at (0,b). The angle at T between Q and S is the angle between TQ and TS. Vector TQ is from T to Q: (0,q) - (0,0) = (0,q). Vector TS is from T to S: (0,b) - (0,0) = (0,b). The angle between these two vectors is determined by their dot product:

TQ · TS = (0)(0) + (q)(b) = qb.

For the angle to be right, the dot product must be zero: qb = 0. So either q=0 or b=0.

If q=0, then Q is at (0,0), which is T, but Q is a distinct point, so invalid. Hence, b=0. So S is at (0,0), which is T. But then S=T, meaning the center is at T, which is the midpoint of PR. Hence, PR is a diameter. Then, the length PR = 12, so radius is 6. Then, the distance from S (at T) to Q is |q - 0| = |q| = radius = 6. So Q is at (0,6) or (0,-6). But since QT is the segment from Q to T, which is from (0,6) to (0,0), length is 6, matching our earlier calculation. Also, angle QTS is at T between Q(0,6), T(0,0), S(0,0). Wait, but S is T, so the angle is between Q and S, but S is T, so the angle becomes undefined. This suggests inconsistency again.

Ah! There's a contradiction here. If S is at T, then the center is at T, making PR a diameter. But then, the angle QTS would involve S and T being the same point, making the angle undefined. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. What's the error here?

Wait, the problem states that QT is perpendicular to PR, and T is the midpoint of PR. Also, angle QTS is a right angle. If S is the center, then ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR. QT is also perpendicular to PR, so Q lies on the line ST. Hence, Q is on the line ST, which contains S. So Q could be on the line ST extended beyond T. Let me reconsider the coordinates with S not at T.

Let me place T at (0,0), PR horizontal from (-6,0) to (6,0). The center S lies somewhere on the y-axis, at (0, b). Q is on the line ST, which is the y-axis, so Q is at (0, q). The condition that angle QTS is a right angle requires that vectors TQ and TS are perpendicular. As before, vectors TQ = (0, q) and TS = (0, b). Their dot product is qb. For perpendicularity, qb = 0. So either q=0 or b=0. q=0 would put Q at T, which isn't allowed, so b=0. This forces S to be at (0,0), which is T, leading to the same contradiction. 

This suggests that there's no solution under these conditions, which can't be true since the problem exists. Therefore, my approach must have a flaw. Let me think differently.

Maybe the issue is that angle QTS is not between TQ and TS, but rather between QT and TS. Wait, the predicate is RightAngle(Angle(Q,T,S)), which means the angle at T between Q and S. So, the angle is formed by the segments TQ and TS. For this angle to be right, the vectors TQ and TS must be perpendicular. As before, this requires qb=0. But this leads to S being at T. Hence, the only possibility is that S is T, making PR a diameter. But then angle QTS would require S to be T, which makes the angle undefined. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in interpreting the predicates. 

Wait, looking back, the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(S)), which means P is on the circle with center S. Similarly for Q and R. So S is the center. The line QT is perpendicular to PR. And T is the midpoint of PR. Also, RightAngle(Angle(Q,T,S)) implies that angle at T between Q and S is right. So, if S is the center, then ST is the perpendicular bisector of PR, and QT is also perpendicular to PR, so Q lies on line ST. Hence, Q is on the line ST, which passes through the center S. So Q is either between S and T or on the extension beyond T. 

Let me consider Q being on the extension of ST beyond T, away from S. So, if S is at (0, b), T is at (0,0), and Q is at (0, -k), for some k > 0. Then, QT is the segment from Q(0,-k) to T(0,0), length k. Also, ST is from S(0,b) to T(0,0), length |b|. Then, the angle at T between Q and S is between TQ (from T to Q, down) and TS (from T to S, up). These vectors are in opposite directions, so the angle between them is 180 degrees, not right. So that doesn't satisfy the right angle condition. 

Alternatively, if Q is between S and T. So, S is at (0,b), T is at (0,0), and Q is at (0, c), where 0 < c < b. Then, TQ is from T(0,0) to Q(0,c), and TS is from T(0,0) to S(0,b). These vectors are in the same direction, so the angle between them is 0 degrees, not right. 

Thus, no matter where Q is on line ST, the angle at T between TQ and TS is either 0°, 180°, or undefined. Hence, the only way for the angle to be 90° is if the vectors are perpendicular, which requires qb = 0, leading to S being at T. But that creates a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement or my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the angle. Maybe the angle is at Q? No, the predicate is Angle(Q,T,S), so the angle at T. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is at Q? No, the syntax is Angle(Q,T,S), which means the angle at T between Q and S. 

This is perplexing. Given that the problem is solvable, there must be a way around this. Let me revisit the given data. 

We know that arc PQR measures 98°. Since P, Q, R are on the circle, this arc is from P to R through Q. So, the measure of this arc is equal to the measure of the central angle ∠PSR. Hence, ∠PSR = 98°. Since S is the center, this angle is the central angle corresponding to arc PR, which passes through Q. Wait, but if Q is on the arc PR, then arc PR is 98°, which is the measure of the central angle. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc PQ. To find this, we need to know the position of Q on arc PR. If we can determine the measure of arc PQ, it would be a portion of arc PR. 

But how? Maybe using triangle properties. Since we know that QT is perpendicular to PR, and T is the midpoint. Also, we know that QT = 6. Earlier, we derived that QT = 6, and from the right triangle QTS, which led to contradictions. But perhaps there's another relationship.

Since QT is perpendicular to PR and T is the midpoint, then QT is the altitude from Q to PR. In triangle SPR, where S is the center, PR is a chord, and QT is the altitude from Q to PR. But how does this help?

Alternatively, since S is the center, and Q is on the circle, then SQ is a radius. Also, PR is a chord, and T is its midpoint. The distance from S to PR is ST, which we denoted as d. From the chord length formula: (PR/2)^2 + d^2 = r^2 => 6^2 + d^2 = r^2. 

Also, in triangle QTS, right-angled at T, we have QT = 6, and ST = d, so QS^2 = QT^2 + ST^2 = 36 + d^2 = r^2, which matches the chord formula. So this holds true. But this doesn't give us new info. 

But we also know that arc PR is 98°, so the central angle ∠PSR is 98°. In triangle SPR, since S is the center, SP = SR = r. So triangle SPR is isosceles with SP = SR. The base is PR = 12, and the apex angle at S is 98°. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle SPR:

PR^2 = SP^2 + SR^2 - 2*SP*SR*cos(angle at S)

Which gives:

12^2 = r^2 + r^2 - 2*r*r*cos(98°)

=> 144 = 2r² - 2r² cos(98°)

Divide both sides by 2:

72 = r² (1 - cos(98°))

But we also have from the chord formula: r² = 36 + d². But without knowing d, this might not help directly. However, we can express r in terms of d, but we need more relations. 

Alternatively, since we know that in triangle QTS, right-angled at T, QT = 6, and ST = d, and QS = r, we have r² = 36 + d². But also, from the Law of Cosines above, r² = 72 / (1 - cos(98°)).

Wait, this might allow us to solve for d, but it's getting complicated. Let me calculate the numerical value.

First, calculate 1 - cos(98°). Convert 98° to radians if needed, but assuming calculator use:

cos(98°) ≈ cos(90° + 8°) = -sin(8°) ≈ -0.1392. So 1 - (-0.1392) = 1.1392.

Then, r² = 72 / 1.1392 ≈ 63.13.

From the chord formula, r² = 36 + d². So d² = r² - 36 ≈ 63.13 - 36 = 27.13 → d ≈ √27.13 ≈ 5.21. 

But how does this help us find the measure of arc PQ? 

Let me think about the position of Q on the circle. Since Q is on the line ST, and T is the midpoint of PR, and S is the center. So, Q is somewhere along the line ST. Let me imagine the circle with center S, chord PR, midpoint T, and Q on the line ST. 

The arc PR is 98°, so the central angle ∠PSR is 98°. Now, the arc PQ would be part of this arc PR. To find its measure, we need to determine the position of Q on arc PR. 

Since Q is on the line ST, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR, and the circle, Q could be on either side of the diameter PR. But given that angle QTS is a right angle, which we couldn't resolve earlier, perhaps there's a relation between the arcs.

Wait, since Q is on the line ST, and S is the center, then the position of Q determines the arc PQ. Let me consider the central angles. 

Let me denote the measure of arc PQ as x, and arc QR as y. Since the total arc PR is 98°, then x + y = 98°. 

But how to find x? Perhaps using the fact that Q is on the line ST, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR. 

If I consider triangle SQR or SPQ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since Q is on the line ST, which passes through the center S, then the line ST passes through the center. Hence, Q is collinear with S and T. 

If I draw the line ST, which is the perpendicular bisector of PR, and Q is on this line. Let me consider the position of Q relative to the arc PR. 

If Q is on the arc PR that does not contain the other points, or on the opposite arc. But since arc PQR is 98°, Q must be on the arc PR that makes the arc PQR. 

Assuming that Q is on the arc PR, then the central angle for arc PQ is x, and for QR is y, with x + y = 98°. 

But how to find x? Maybe using the fact that QT is perpendicular to PR, and QT = 6. 

Earlier, we found that QT = 6, and in the right triangle QTS, we have QT = 6, ST = d, and QS = r. Also, from the Law of Cosines, we have r² = 72 / (1 - cos(98°)) ≈ 63.13. 

But how to relate this to the arcs? 

Perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle SQT. Wait, triangle SQT has a right angle at T. So, sin(angle at Q) = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/QS = d/r. Similarly, cos(angle at Q) = QT/QS = 6/r. 

But angle at Q in triangle SQT is the angle between SQ and QT. Not sure if helpful. 

Alternatively, since Q is on the circle, and we know the position of Q relative to the center S and the chord PR, perhaps we can find the angle subtended by PQ at the center S. 

Let me consider the central angle for arc PQ, which is the angle ∠PSQ. This angle would be equal to the measure of arc PQ. To find this angle, perhaps we can relate it to other angles in the figure. 

But how? Let me think about triangle SPQ. SP and SQ are both radii, so triangle SPQ is isosceles with SP = SQ = r. The base is PQ, and the base angles at P and Q are equal. But I don't know the length of PQ or any angles. 

Alternatively, since Q is on the line ST, and T is the midpoint of PR, maybe we can find the relationship between the angles. 

Let me consider the coordinates again, but this time allowing S to be at (0, b), T at (0,0), P(-6,0), R(6,0), Q(0, q). We know that angle QTS is a right angle, which requires qb = 0, leading to b=0 or q=0. Since q=0 is invalid, b=0, making S at (0,0), which is T. This brings us back to the earlier contradiction, but perhaps we can proceed despite it. 

If S is at T(0,0), then PR is a diameter of length 12, so radius is 6. Q is on the circle, so its distance from S is 6. Since Q is on the y-axis, Q is at (0,6) or (0,-6). Let's take Q at (0,6). Then, the arc PQ would be from P(-6,0) to Q(0,6). The central angle for this arc is the angle between SP and SQ. 

Vector SP is from S(0,0) to P(-6,0): (-6,0). Vector SQ is from S(0,0) to Q(0,6): (0,6). The angle between these vectors is 90 degrees, since one is along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. So the central angle is 90°, making arc PQ measure 90°. But the given arc PQR is 98°, which would mean arc PR is 98°, but in this scenario, arc PR is 180° since it's a diameter. Contradiction. 

Alternatively, if Q is at (0,-6), then the central angle between SP and SQ would be 270°, but the smaller arc would be 90°. Still, this doesn't align with the given arc measure of 98°. 

This suggests that the only way to satisfy the given arc measure of 98° is if Q is not on the diameter, but this conflicts with the earlier conclusion that S must be at T. 

This indicates that there's a missing piece or a misinterpretation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "m∠PQR = 98". Wait, no, the question is about m∠PQR? No, the question is about m∠PQ, which is arc PQ. Wait, the question says: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the original question is: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the actual question is: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the original question is: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, let me check.

Original question: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ."

Wait, no, the original question is about arc PQ, not angle. The user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, looking back:

The user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the original question is: "Find m∠PQ." Or was it arc PQ? Let me check.

The user wrote: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the original problem says: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, actually, the original question is about arc PQ. Let me recheck.

The user's question: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the original problem is: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Or is it arc PQ? Let me look at the original problem again.

Original problem: "In ⊙ S, m∠PQR = 98. Find m∠PQ." Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." But the question might be about the arc measure, not the angle. Wait, the original problem says: "Find m∠PQ." Or is it arc PQ?

Wait, in the problem statement, the user wrote: "Find m∠PQ." But in the context of a circle, it's more likely to be asking for the measure of arc PQ, not the angle. Perhaps there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the angle PQ, but in the given predicates, there's a mention of Angle(Q,T,S) being a right angle. 

Assuming the question is about the measure of arc PQ, given that arc PQR is 98°, let's proceed with that. 

Since arc PQR is 98°, and Q is on the circle, this arc is from P to R through Q. If we can find the measure of arc PQ, which is a part of this arc. 

If we can determine the measure of arc PQ, it would be half of the central angle ∠PSQ. But how?

Alternatively, since QT is perpendicular to PR, and T is the midpoint, and S is the center, and QT = 6, and we've determined that QT = 6, and from earlier, in the right triangle QTS, we have QT = 6, ST = d, and QS = r. 

Also, from the Law of Cosines on triangle SPR, we have r² = 72 / (1 - cos(98°)) ≈ 63.13. 

Now, let's consider the position of Q on the circle. Since Q is on line ST, and S is the center, let's consider the central angle for arc PQ. 

Let me consider the triangle SPT. Wait, no
