MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle EFGH. Wait, rectangles have four right angles, right? And opposite sides are equal and parallel. The question gives us that angle HGE is 13 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle FGE. Hmm, okay.

First, I should visualize the rectangle. Let me sketch it mentally. Let's label the points: E, F, G, H. Since it's a rectangle, the order matters. Typically, rectangles are labeled in order so that consecutive letters are adjacent vertices. So, if it's EFGH, then the sides would be EF, FG, GH, HE. So, connecting E to F to G to H to E. 

Now, the given angle is angle HGE. That means vertex at G, with segments HG and GE. Wait, H connected to G, and G connected to E. So, point G is one corner of the rectangle. In a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. But here, they mention angle HGE is 13 degrees. Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. How come there's a 13-degree angle mentioned?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the labeling. Let me check again. The problem says Quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle. Then, the given predicates include RightAngle(Angle(H,G,E)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,G,E)), 13). Wait, that seems conflicting because in a rectangle, angle at G should be 90 degrees. But according to the problem, angle HGE measures 13 degrees. That suggests that maybe the figure isn't a standard rectangle? Or perhaps there's some other construction?

Wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is referring to a different configuration. Let me re-examine the given predicates. There's also IntersectionOf(Line(E,G), Line(F,H), Point(K)). So, lines EG and FH intersect at K. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,G))) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,K)), LengthOf(Line(K,H))). So, K is the midpoint of both EG and FH? Because if EK equals KG and FK equals KH, then K is the intersection point of the diagonals of the rectangle. But in a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so yes, K would be the midpoint. However, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles. 

But wait, the problem states that angle HGE is 13 degrees. But in a rectangle, angle at G is 90 degrees. So how can angle HGE be 13 degrees? Unless... Oh! Wait, maybe angle HGE is not the internal angle of the rectangle. Let me clarify. Angle HGE has vertex at G, with segments HG and GE. So, in the rectangle, HG is one side, GE is another. But in a rectangle, HG and GE would meet at G, forming a right angle. Therefore, angle HGE should be 90 degrees. But the problem says it's 13 degrees. This contradiction implies that my initial assumption about the shape might be wrong.

Wait, but the problem starts by stating that Quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle. So, perhaps there's more to it. Let me think again. Maybe the figure isn't a standard rectangle? Or maybe it's a different kind of quadrilateral? Wait, the first predicate says Rectangle(E,F,G,H), so that defines EFGH as a rectangle. Then, the rest of the predicates describe lines and intersections. 

Alternatively, maybe angle HGE refers to a different angle. Wait, HG is a side of the rectangle, GE is another side. So, if EFGH is a rectangle, then points E, F, G, H are arranged such that E-F-G-H-E. So, moving around the rectangle. Therefore, at point G, the sides are FG and GH. Wait, so the angle at G is between FG and GH, which is 90 degrees. But angle HGE is formed by points H, G, E. So, that would be the angle at G between HG and GE. Wait, but GE is not a side of the rectangle. Wait, GE connects G to E. In the rectangle EFGH, E is connected to F and H. So, GE is a diagonal from G to E. Therefore, angle HGE is the angle between HG (which is a side) and GE (the diagonal). So, that angle is not the internal angle of the rectangle, but rather an angle formed by a side and a diagonal.

Ah! That makes sense. So, in the rectangle, the diagonal splits the angle at G into two parts. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they don't necessarily split the angles unless it's a square. So, if the rectangle is not a square, the diagonals will split the angles into unequal parts. 

So, given that, angle HGE is part of triangle HGE. Let me try to draw this mentally. At point G, we have side HG going to H, and diagonal GE going to E. So, angle at G between HG and GE is 13 degrees. Now, since EFGH is a rectangle, HG is perpendicular to FG. Also, since it's a rectangle, HE is equal to FG, and so on. 

Let me consider triangle HGE. In this triangle, we know angle at G is 13 degrees. Also, since EFGH is a rectangle, HE is equal to FG, and HG is equal to EF. But maybe I need to use trigonometry here. Alternatively, maybe using properties of rectangles and triangles.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, HE is parallel to FG, and HG is parallel to EF. Also, the diagonals EG and FH intersect at K, which is the midpoint. Given that EK = KG and FK = KH. Also, the problem mentions that the length of EK equals KG, which is already satisfied in a rectangle because diagonals bisect each other. Similarly, FK equals KH. 

But how does this relate to the angle HGE being 13 degrees? Let me focus on triangle HGE. In triangle HGE, we have angle at G is 13 degrees. What other angles can we find? Well, in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. So, HG is perpendicular to HE. Wait, HG is a vertical side (assuming standard orientation), and HE is horizontal. Wait, maybe coordinates could help here. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.

Let me place point G at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose HG is along the y-axis and HE is along the x-axis. Wait, but depending on the rectangle's orientation. Let me define coordinates properly. Let me assume point G is at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, let me define the points:

- Let’s say point G is at (0, 0).

- Since HG is a side of the rectangle, and assuming the rectangle is oriented so that HG is vertical. So, point H would be at (0, b) for some b > 0.

- Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, moving from H to G to F to E. Wait, the order is E-F-G-H-E. So, starting at E, then F, then G, then H, back to E. So, the rectangle is E connected to F, F connected to G, G connected to H, H connected to E.

Therefore, if G is at (0,0), then H is connected to G. Assuming the rectangle is oriented so that HG is vertical. Let me think. Suppose HG is vertical. Then, moving from H to G is down, so if G is at (0,0), then H is at (0, h) where h is positive. Then, from G to F would be horizontal. So, F would be at (f, 0), where f is positive. Then, from F to E would go up to E. Since HE connects H to E. So, E would be at (f, h). Because from H at (0,h), moving horizontally to E would require that E is at (f, h), making HE horizontal. Then, FG is from F(f,0) to G(0,0), which is horizontal left. Then, EF is from E(f,h) to F(f,0), which is vertical down. Wait, but that would make the rectangle with sides FG and HE being horizontal, and GH and FE being vertical. Wait, but then the angle at G would be between FG (from G to F, which is left along x-axis) and GH (from G to H, which is up along y-axis). So, that angle at G would be 90 degrees. But in our case, angle HGE is 13 degrees, which is the angle at G between HG and GE. So, GE connects G(0,0) to E(f,h). So, vector from G to E is (f, h). Vector from G to H is (0, h). So, angle between these two vectors is 13 degrees.

So, in triangle HGE, we have points H(0, h), G(0,0), E(f, h). The angle at G between HG and GE is 13 degrees. Let me compute that angle. Using vectors, the angle between HG and GE. Vector HG is from G to H: (0 - 0, h - 0) = (0, h). Vector GE is from G to E: (f - 0, h - 0) = (f, h). The angle between these vectors can be found via the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (HG • GE) / (|HG| |GE|)

Compute the dot product: (0)(f) + (h)(h) = h².

|HG| is sqrt(0² + h²) = h.

|GE| is sqrt(f² + h²).

Thus,

cos(theta) = h² / (h * sqrt(f² + h²)) ) = h / sqrt(f² + h²)

We're told theta is 13 degrees. So,

h / sqrt(f² + h²) = cos(13°)

Let me denote tan(theta) as well. Alternatively, since theta is the angle between HG (vertical) and GE (diagonal), then tan(theta) would be the ratio of the horizontal component over the vertical component. Wait, because if we imagine a right triangle where the vertical leg is h, and the horizontal leg is f, then the angle between the vertical leg and hypotenuse is theta. Thus, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = f / h.

Wait, but theta is the angle between HG (vertical) and GE (hypotenuse). So, yes, tan(theta) = f/h.

So, tan(13°) = f/h → f = h * tan(13°)

So, the ratio of f to h is tan(13°). 

Now, we need to find the measure of angle FGE. Let me figure out what angle FGE refers to. It's the angle at point G between FG and GE. So, FG is from G to F, which is horizontal to the left (since F is at (f,0) and G is at (0,0)), and GE is from G to E, which is the diagonal to (f, h). So, angle between FG (left along x-axis) and GE (to E). 

So, angle FGE is the angle between FG and GE at point G. Let's calculate that. 

In terms of coordinates, FG is pointing towards (-f, 0) from G, and GE is pointing towards (f, h). So, the angle between these two vectors. Let me compute that angle. 

Vector GF is from G to F: (f - 0, 0 - 0) = (f, 0). Wait, no: FG is from F to G, but angle FGE is at G, so the vectors are GF and GE. Wait, angle at G between FG and GE. So, one vector is from G to F, which is (f, 0) direction (but since F is at (f,0) and G is at (0,0), the vector GF is (f,0) - (0,0) = (f, 0). The other vector is GE, which is (f, h). 

Wait, but angle between GF and GE. So, vectors GF = (f, 0) and GE = (f, h). Let me compute the angle between these two vectors. 

Using the dot product formula again:

cos(phi) = (GF • GE) / (|GF| |GE|)

GF • GE = f*f + 0*h = f²

|GF| = sqrt(f² + 0) = f

|GE| = sqrt(f² + h²)

Thus,

cos(phi) = f² / (f * sqrt(f² + h²)) ) = f / sqrt(f² + h²)

Which simplifies to:

cos(phi) = f / sqrt(f² + h²) = 1 / sqrt(1 + (h/f)^2 )

But earlier, we had tan(theta) = f/h = tan(13°), so h/f = cot(13°). Therefore, substituting:

sqrt(1 + (h/f)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + cot²(13°)) = csc(13°), since 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ.

Therefore, cos(phi) = 1 / csc(13°) = sin(13°)

Thus, phi = arccos(sin(13°))

Hmm, but arccos(sin(13°))? Let me think. Alternatively, note that sin(13°) = cos(90° - 13°) = cos(77°). So, arccos(cos(77°)) = 77°, assuming phi is acute. So, angle phi is 77 degrees. 

Therefore, angle FGE is 77 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, D is 77. So, the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me verify again. Since tan(theta) = f/h = tan(13°), so f/h = tan(13°). Therefore, h/f = cot(13°). Then, in the calculation for phi, cos(phi) = f / sqrt(f² + h²) = 1 / sqrt(1 + (h/f)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 + cot²(13°)) = 1 / csc(13°) = sin(13°). Hence, phi = arccos(sin(13°)). But sin(13°) = cos(90° - 13°) = cos(77°), so arccos(cos(77°)) = 77°, since 77° is within the principal range of arccos. Therefore, angle FGE is 77°, which corresponds to choice D.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is D.
