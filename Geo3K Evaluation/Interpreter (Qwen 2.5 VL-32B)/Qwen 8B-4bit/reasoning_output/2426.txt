MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two rectangles, one with area 8 and another with area 32. They're similar, and we need to find the width x of the larger rectangle. 

First, I remember that similar figures have corresponding sides in proportion. Since they're rectangles, all angles are right angles, so the ratio of their widths should be the same as the ratio of their heights. But since it's a rectangle, the ratio of length to width would be the same for both. Wait, but maybe I should focus on the areas first.

The area of a rectangle is width multiplied by height. For similar rectangles, the ratio of their areas should be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Let me recall that. If two shapes are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the scale factor. So if the original area is A1 and the new area is A2, then A2/A1 = (scale factor)^2. 

In this case, the areas are 8 and 32. So the ratio of areas is 32/8 = 4. That means the scale factor squared is 4, so the scale factor is sqrt(4) = 2. Therefore, each side of the larger rectangle is twice as long as the corresponding side of the smaller one. 

But wait, the problem asks for the width of the larger rectangle. We know the width of the smaller rectangle is 4. Since the scale factor is 2, multiplying 4 by 2 gives 8. So x should be 8? Let me check again. 

Wait, the smaller rectangle has width 4 and area 8. So its height would be area divided by width: 8 / 4 = 2. Then the larger rectangle has area 32. If the scale factor is 2, then its height would be 2*2=4, and width would be 4*2=8. So yes, the width x is 8. 

Looking at the options, choice C is 8. So the answer should be C. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. The key was recognizing that similar rectangles have area ratios equal to the square of the side ratio. So the ratio of areas is 4, hence the sides are doubled. Thus, the width of the larger rectangle is double the smaller one's width, which is 4*2=8. Yep, that seems right.
