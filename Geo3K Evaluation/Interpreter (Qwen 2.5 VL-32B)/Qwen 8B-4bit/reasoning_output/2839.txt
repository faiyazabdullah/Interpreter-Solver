MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points J, K, and L. There are lines connecting J-K, K-L, and J-L. Also, there's a circle K. The Line(J,L) is a diameter of Circle(K), and Lines J-K and K-L are radii of the same circle. So, that tells me that points J and L are endpoints of the diameter, and point K is somewhere on the circle? Wait, no—if Line(J,L) is the diameter, then K must be the center of the circle because the radius would be from the center to the circumference. But wait, the Line(J,K) and Line(K,L) are radii. So if Line(J,L) is the diameter, then its length should be twice the radius. 

Let me visualize this. Points J and L are at the ends of the diameter of circle K. Then point K is the center? Wait, but the circle is named K. Oh, maybe the circle is centered at point K? Because in the predicate IsRadiusOf(Line(J,K), Circle(K)), so the line from J to K is a radius of the circle K. Similarly, Line(K,L) is also a radius. That means that K is the center of the circle. Therefore, J and L are points on the circle such that JK and KL are radii. Therefore, JL is the diameter, since it connects two points on the circle passing through the center K. So the length of JL would be twice the radius. 

Now, the problem mentions the area of a semicircle being 66 cm². The formula given for the area of the semicircle is (πx²)/8. Wait, but usually, the area of a full circle is πr², so a semicircle would be (πr²)/2. However, here the formula is given as Div(Mul(Pi, Pow(x, 2)), 8). Which simplifies to (πx²)/8. Hmm, that seems different. Maybe there's something wrong here. Or perhaps x isn't the radius but another measurement?

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,L)), x). So x is the length of the diameter JL. Since JL is the diameter, and the radius is half of that, so radius r = x/2. Then the area of a semicircle would normally be (πr²)/2. Substituting r = x/2 gives (π*(x/2)^2)/2 = πx²/(8). Oh! So the formula given in the predicate is correct. Therefore, the area of the semicircle is πx²/8, and this equals 66 cm². 

So we can set up the equation: πx² / 8 = 66. Solving for x would involve multiplying both sides by 8, dividing by π, and taking the square root. Let me write that down.

First, multiply both sides by 8: πx² = 66*8 → πx² = 528. Then divide both sides by π: x² = 528 / π. Then take the square root: x = sqrt(528 / π). Now, compute this numerically. Let me calculate the numerical value. 

But wait, the answer choices are numbers like 4.6, 6.5, 13.0, 26.0. Let me see. Let's compute sqrt(528 / π). Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 528 divided by 3.1416 is approximately... Let me do that division first. 528 ÷ 3.1416 ≈ 168.07. Then the square root of 168.07 is approximately... Well, sqrt(169) is 13, so sqrt(168.07) is slightly less than 13. So around 12.97? That's very close to 13. So the answer would be approximately 13.0, which is option C.

But let me check my steps again to make sure. 

Given that the area of the semicircle is πx²/8 = 66. So solving for x:

Multiply both sides by 8: πx² = 528  
Divide by π: x² = 528 / π  
Take square root: x = √(528 / π)

Calculating 528 / π: Using π ≈ 3.1416, 528 ÷ 3.1416 ≈ 168.07. Square root of 168.07 is indeed about 12.96, which rounds to 13.0. Hence, the answer is C. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 13.0. So that must be the correct answer.
