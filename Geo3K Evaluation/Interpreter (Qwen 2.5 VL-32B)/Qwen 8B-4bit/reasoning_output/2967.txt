Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: A-B, B-C, C-A forming triangle ABC. Then there's A-D, D-E, E-B, so maybe another triangle? Also, C-D and C-E. The triangles mentioned are ABC, ADB, and CDE. Wait, Triangle(A,D,B) would be triangle ADB, right? And Triangle(C,D,E) is triangle CDE.

Now, there are some right angles: Angle at A, DB is a right angle. So, angle at point D between points A and B? Wait, RightAngle(Angle(A,DB)) – that notation might mean the angle at point D formed by points A, D, B? Or maybe it's angle at A? Wait, the syntax here is confusing. Let me think. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) usually means the angle at Y between X and Z. So if it's Angle(A,DB), that would be angle at D between A and B. So ∠ADB is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,DE)) would be angle at E between C and D? Wait, DE is the line from D to E, so Angle(C,DE) would be angle at D between C and E? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The angle notation is typically Angle(Vertex, Point1, Point2). So Angle(A,DB) would be angle at D between A and B. So that's ∠ADB is a right angle. Similarly, Angle(C,DE) would be angle at E between C and D? Wait, DE is the line from D to E, so maybe the angle at D between C and E? Hmm, perhaps the second one is angle at E between C and D? Not sure. But given the lines, maybe there's more structure here.

Also, there are length equalities. CA is 10 units, CD is 2 units, CE is t-2, EB is t+1. We need to find CE, which is t-2. Wait, but the question says: "If CE = t - 2. EB = t + 1, CD = 2, and CA = 10, find CE." Wait, but CE is expressed in terms of t, and EB is also in terms of t. So maybe we need to find t first?

But wait, the problem says "find CE", and CE is t-2. So if we can find t, then CE is determined. However, the answer choices are numerical, so perhaps there's a way to find t using the given constraints.

Let me list all the given info again:

Points: A, B, C, D, E.

Lines: AB, BC, CA (so triangle ABC); AD, DE, EB; CD, CE. Also, C lies on line AC (since PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,C)) – D is on AC. Similarly, E lies on line BC (PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,C))). So D is somewhere along AC, and E is along BC.

Triangles: ABC, ADB, CDE. Also, right angles at ∠ADB and ∠CDE? Wait, the right angles are specified as RightAngle(Angle(A,DB)) which is ∠ADB, and RightAngle(Angle(C,DE)) which could be ∠CDE? Let me check again.

If Angle(C, DE) is the angle at D between C and E? Because DE is part of the line from D to E. Wait, if we have line DE, then angle at D involving C and E would be ∠CDE. So that's a right angle. So ∠CDE is a right angle.

So, triangle CDE has a right angle at D. Therefore, triangle CDE is right-angled at D. Since CD=2, and CE=t-2. But CE is the hypotenuse? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle CDE, right-angled at D, so sides CD and DE are legs, and CE is the hypotenuse? Wait, but CE is connected to point E. Wait, but E is on BC. Let me try to visualize.

First, let's sketch mentally the figure. Points A, B, C form triangle ABC. D is on AC, since D lies on line AC. E is on BC, since E lies on line BC. Lines AD and DE connect to D and E. Also, there's line EB connecting E to B. Also, lines CD and CE. So, C is connected to D and E.

Given that ∠ADB is a right angle. So, triangle ADB is right-angled at D. Also, triangle CDE is right-angled at D.

Wait, but D is on AC. So, if D is on AC, then AD is part of AC. So, triangle ADB has right angle at D. That suggests that BD is perpendicular to AD. So, BD ⊥ AD. Similarly, triangle CDE is right-angled at D, so CD is perpendicular to DE. Wait, because angle at D in CDE is right angle. So CD is perpendicular to DE. But D is on AC, so CD is part of AC? No, CD connects C to D. Wait, since D is on AC, then CD is a segment from C to D, which is along AC? Wait, no. Because AC is a line from A to C. D is on AC, so CD is part of AC. Wait, but if D is on AC, then CD is just a segment from C to D, which is along AC. But then CD is part of AC. So, if CD is perpendicular to DE, then DE must be perpendicular to AC. Because CD is along AC. So DE is perpendicular to AC. Also, BD is perpendicular to AD, which is part of AC. So BD is perpendicular to AD, which is part of AC. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to AC. So BD is an altitude from B to AC?

But maybe I should formalize this with coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let’s place point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Since CA = 10, and D is on AC. Let me assume AC is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s let C be at (0, 0). Let’s take AC as x-axis. So point A is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me suppose that point A is at (-10, 0), since CA = 10. Then point C is at (0,0), and point A is at (-10, 0). Now, point D is on AC. Since CD = 2, and since AC is from C(0,0) to A(-10,0), then moving from C towards A, 2 units. Since AC is 10 units long, then D is located 2 units away from C towards A. So coordinates of D would be (-2, 0)? Wait, because from C(0,0) to A(-10,0), moving left 2 units would put D at (-2, 0). Yes.

So D is at (-2, 0).

Now, E is on BC. Let me find coordinates for B. Let me denote coordinates for B as (x, y). But since there are right angles involved, maybe I can use the right angles to find relations.

We know that ∠ADB is a right angle. Since D is at (-2, 0), and A is at (-10, 0). So line AD is from A(-10, 0) to D(-2, 0), which is horizontal. So BD is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, BD must be vertical. Therefore, BD is vertical line passing through D(-2, 0). Therefore, point B must lie somewhere along the vertical line x=-2. So coordinates of B are (-2, k) for some k.

Additionally, E lies on BC. Let me find coordinates for E. Let me consider line BC. Point B is at (-2, k), point C is at (0, 0). So parametric equations for BC: starting at B(-2, k) going to C(0,0). Let me parameterize E as lying somewhere on BC. Let me write coordinates for E as follows: Let’s say BE = t + 1, and EC is something. Wait, but we have CE = t - 2. Wait, the problem states that CE = t - 2 and EB = t + 1. So the total length of CB is CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t -1. But CB is the distance from C(0,0) to B(-2, k). Let me compute CB's length. Coordinates of B are (-2, k), so CB vector is from C(0,0) to B(-2, k): distance sqrt[(-2)^2 + k^2] = sqrt(4 + k²). Therefore, CB = sqrt(4 + k²) = 2t - 1. But I don't know k yet.

Also, there's another right angle: ∠CDE is a right angle. Since D is at (-2, 0), and C is at (0, 0). So CD is from C(0,0) to D(-2, 0), which is along the x-axis. Then, angle at D between C and E is right angle. So DE is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is horizontal (from C(0,0) to D(-2, 0)), direction is left along x-axis. Therefore, DE must be vertical upwards or downwards. So DE is vertical line from D(-2, 0). Thus, point E lies along the vertical line passing through D(-2, 0). Wait, but earlier we said E is on BC. So E is intersection of BC and vertical line through D(-2, 0).

Therefore, point E is where BC meets the vertical line x = -2. Let me find coordinates of E.

Parametrize line BC. From B(-2, k) to C(0, 0). Parametric equations: x = -2 + s*(0 - (-2)) = -2 + 2s, y = k + s*(0 - k) = k - ks, where s ∈ [0, 1].

We want to find point E on BC such that x-coordinate is -2. So set x = -2: -2 + 2s = -2 → 2s = 0 → s=0. But s=0 gives point B(-2, k). That can’t be unless E coincides with B, which would imply EB = 0, but according to the problem, EB = t + 1, which is positive. Contradiction. Wait, that suggests a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, why did I conclude that DE is vertical? Because angle CDE is a right angle, with CD being horizontal. So CD is from C(0,0) to D(-2, 0), so direction from D to C is towards the right. The angle at D between C and E is right angle. So vectors DC and DE are perpendicular. Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - (-2), 0 - 0) = (2, 0). Vector DE is from D to E: (E_x - (-2), E_y - 0) = (E_x + 2, E_y). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: (2)(E_x + 2) + (0)(E_y) = 0 → 2(E_x + 2) = 0 → E_x = -2. So yes, E_x = -2. So E lies on vertical line x = -2. But line BC goes from B(-2, k) to C(0,0). So the only point on BC with x=-2 is point B itself. Which implies that E coincides with B? But that contradicts the fact that E is distinct from B, since EB is t + 1. Unless t + 1 = 0, which isn't possible since lengths are positive. So there's a contradiction here. What did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe my assumption about the position of B is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I assumed that because ∠ADB is a right angle, BD is vertical. Let me verify that again. AD is from A(-10, 0) to D(-2, 0), which is horizontal. For ∠ADB to be right angle, BD must be perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, BD must be vertical. Hence, B lies on vertical line through D(-2, 0). So coordinates of B are (-2, k). Then line BC connects B(-2, k) to C(0, 0). So parametric equations for BC: x = -2 + 2s, y = k - ks. As before.

Then, point E is on BC and also on vertical line x = -2. The only intersection is at s=0, which is B. So this suggests that E=B, which conflicts with EB = t + 1. So something is wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the right angle. Maybe the right angle is at E instead of D? Let me check the original predicates again. It says RightAngle(Angle(C, DE)). So the angle at E between C and D? Wait, the notation is ambiguous. If it's Angle(C, DE), then it's the angle at D between C and E? Or angle at E between C and D? The notation Angle(X, Y, Z) is angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(C, DE) would be angle at D between C and E. So that's ∠CDE, right? So the right angle is at D. Hence, previous conclusion holds. So this seems like a contradiction. How can E be on BC and also on vertical line through D, except for B?

This suggests that either my coordinate setup is flawed, or there's a misunderstanding in the configuration. Let me try alternative approaches.

Perhaps the error comes from assuming AC is horizontal. Maybe I should assign coordinates differently. Let me try another coordinate system.

Alternative approach: Let me place point C at (0, 0), point D at (2, 0) since CD = 2. Wait, earlier I had D on AC, so if CD = 2, then depending on the direction. Wait, if AC is a line, and D is on AC such that CD = 2. Suppose AC is arbitrary. Let me choose coordinates so that point C is at (0, 0), point D is at (2, 0), making CD = 2 units. Then point A is somewhere on the line extending from C through D. Wait, but then AC would be longer than CD. Let me define point A as (a, 0) such that CA = 10. So distance from C(0,0) to A(a,0) is |a| = 10. Let's take a = 10, so A is at (10, 0). Then D is between C and A? If CD = 2, then D is at (2, 0). So AC is from C(0,0) to A(10, 0), with D at (2, 0). Then line AD is from A(10,0) to D(2,0), which is horizontal. Then, ∠ADB is a right angle. So BD must be perpendicular to AD. Since AD is horizontal, BD is vertical. Hence, point B lies on vertical line through D(2, 0). So coordinates of B are (2, b) for some b.

Now, E lies on BC. Let me find coordinates of B as (2, b), C is (0,0). So line BC goes from (2, b) to (0,0). Parametric equations: x = 2 - 2t, y = b - bt, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, E lies on BC and also satisfies the right angle condition ∠CDE is right angle. So, as before, angle at D between C and E is right angle. So vectors DC and DE are perpendicular. DC is from D(2,0) to C(0,0): (-2, 0). DE is from D(2,0) to E(x,y): (x-2, y-0) = (x-2, y). Their dot product must be zero: (-2)(x-2) + 0*y = 0 → -2(x-2) = 0 → x = 2. So E must lie on vertical line x=2. But E is on BC, which goes from B(2,b) to C(0,0). So the only point on BC with x=2 is point B itself. Again, same issue: E coincides with B, leading to EB = 0, conflicting with EB = t + 1. This suggests inconsistency, which indicates a flaw in assumptions.

Wait, but maybe the right angle is at E? If the angle was at E, then different scenario. Let me check the original predicate again. It says RightAngle(Angle(C, DE)). According to standard notation, this would be angle at D between C and E, i.e., ∠CDE. So right angle at D. Hence, previous conclusion. So why does this lead to contradiction?

Maybe my coordinate assignments are causing this. Perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional space? No, it's a plane geometry problem. Alternatively, maybe points are arranged differently. Let me think again.

Another possibility: Maybe E is not between B and C, but extended beyond C? Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,C)), so E is on line BC, which includes extensions. So maybe E is beyond C?

Let me explore that. Let me take E beyond C on line BC. Let me proceed with previous coordinates where C is (0,0), D is (2,0), A is (10,0), B is (2, b). Line BC goes from B(2,b) through C(0,0) to infinity. So E is on line BC, possibly beyond C.

So parametric equations for line BC: starting at B(2,b), direction vector (-2, -b). So parametric equations can be written as x = 2 - 2t, y = b - bt, where t ≥ 0. When t=0, it's B; t=1, it's C; t>1, it's beyond C.

Now, E is on this line, and x=2 for the right angle condition. Wait, earlier calculation shows that for ∠CDE to be right angle, E must lie on x=2. But line BC intersects x=2 only at point B when t=0. So unless E is B, which again causes EB=0. This suggests that there is no such E unless B is at (2, ...), but even then, E would be B. This contradiction suggests that my initial assumptions are wrong. Where am I mistaken?

Wait, maybe the right angle is not at D but at E? Let me reconsider the interpretation of the predicate. The predicate is RightAngle(Angle(C, DE)). If the angle is at E, then it would be Angle(E, C, D), but the notation is Angle(C, DE), which may be parsed as Angle at D between C and E. But maybe it's Angle at E between C and D? That would be different. How to resolve this ambiguity?

In standard notation, Angle(X, Y, Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So if the predicate is RightAngle(Angle(C, DE)), it should be interpreted as the angle at D between C and E, i.e., ∠CDE. But if it were Angle at E, it would be Angle(C, E, D), i.e., ∠CED. So the original parsing is correct. Hence, the contradiction remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at E? Maybe there was a misread in the predicate. Let me check the original input again. The user wrote:

"RightAngle(Angle(A,DB)) 
RightAngle(Angle(C,DE))"

Assuming these are correctly transcribed. So Angle(A,DB) is angle at D between A and B, which is ∠ADB. Angle(C,DE) is angle at D between C and E, which is ∠CDE. So both right angles are at D. Hence, the earlier contradiction.

But then, how can E lie on BC and satisfy ∠CDE being right angle? Only if line BC passes through x=2 (the vertical line through D). But line BC goes from B(2,b) to C(0,0), so it already passes through x=2 at B. Hence, E would have to be B, but that makes EB = 0, which conflicts with EB = t + 1 > 0.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I missed something. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Wait, the problem mentions Triangle(C,D,E). So CDE is a triangle. With right angle at D, as per the right angle predicate. So CD and DE are legs, CE is hypotenuse. So CE² = CD² + DE². Given CD = 2, so CE² = 4 + DE². But CE is given as t - 2. So (t-2)² = 4 + DE² → DE² = (t-2)² - 4 = t² -4t +4 -4 = t² -4t. So DE = sqrt(t² -4t). But DE is a length, so t² -4t ≥ 0 → t ≥4 or t ≤0. Since lengths are positive, t must be ≥4.

Also, EB is t + 1. Let me see if I can express DE in terms of EB.

Since E is on BC, and DE is a segment from D to E. Let me try to find DE in terms of other quantities.

From earlier, in this coordinate system, D is at (2, 0), E is on line BC. Let me find coordinates of E. Let me denote parameters.

Let me take B at (2, b), C at (0,0), D at (2,0). Line BC: parametric equations x = 2 - 2s, y = b - bs, where s is parameter. Point E is somewhere on this line. Let me express coordinates of E as (2 - 2s, b - bs).

Vector DE is from D(2,0) to E: (2 - 2s - 2, b - bs - 0) = (-2s, b - bs).

For ∠CDE to be right angle, vectors DC and DE must be perpendicular. Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 2, 0 - 0) = (-2, 0). Dot product with DE: (-2)*(-2s) + 0*(b - bs) = 4s. For perpendicularity, this must be zero → 4s = 0 → s = 0. Hence, E is at s=0, which is point B. So again, E=B, leading to EB = 0. Contradiction.

This suggests that under current assumptions, it's impossible unless s=0, which conflicts with the given conditions. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the right angle is at E instead of D? Let me try that. Suppose ∠CDE is a right angle at E. Then vectors ED and EC would be perpendicular. Let me recalculate.

If angle at E is right angle, then vectors EC and ED are perpendicular. Let me compute those vectors. 

EC is from E to C: C - E = (0 - x_E, 0 - y_E) = (-x_E, -y_E).

ED is from E to D: D - E = (2 - x_E, 0 - y_E).

Their dot product should be zero: (-x_E)(2 - x_E) + (-y_E)(-y_E) = 0 → -2x_E + x_E² + y_E² = 0.

But since E lies on BC, which has parametric equations x = 2 - 2s, y = b - bs. So substituting:

-2(2 - 2s) + (2 - 2s)^2 + (b - bs)^2 = 0.

Expand this:

-4 + 4s + (4 - 8s + 4s²) + (b² - 2bsb + b²s²) = 0.

Wait, expanding (2 - 2s)^2: 4 - 8s + 4s².

And (b - bs)^2: b²(1 - s)^2 = b²(1 - 2s + s²).

So combining:

-4 + 4s + 4 -8s + 4s² + b² - 2b²s + b²s² = 0.

Simplify term by term:

-4 + 4 cancels. 

4s -8s = -4s.

Then remaining terms: 4s² + b² - 2b²s + b²s².

Combine like terms:

s²(4 + b²) + s(-2b²) + b² = 0.

This equation relates s and b. But without knowing b, this seems difficult to resolve. However, we also have other information: CE = t-2, EB = t+1.

Since E is on BC, the length CE can be computed. Let's express CE in terms of s. 

Coordinates of C are (0,0), E is (2 - 2s, b - bs). So CE length squared is (2 - 2s)^2 + (b - bs)^2 = [2(1 - s)]^2 + [b(1 - s)]^2 = (1 - s)^2 (4 + b²). So CE = |1 - s| * sqrt(4 + b²).

Similarly, EB is the distance from E to B. Coordinates of B are (2, b), E is (2 - 2s, b - bs). So EB squared is (2 - (2 - 2s))^2 + (b - (b - bs))^2 = (2s)^2 + (bs)^2 = s²(4 + b²). So EB = |s| * sqrt(4 + b²).

Given that CE = t - 2 and EB = t + 1. Assuming s > 0 (since E is beyond C?), or s < 1 (if E is between B and C). Let me assume E is between B and C, so s ∈ (0, 1). Then |1 - s| = 1 - s and |s| = s. So:

CE = (1 - s) * sqrt(4 + b²) = t - 2

EB = s * sqrt(4 + b²) = t + 1

Let me call sqrt(4 + b²) as K. Then:

(1 - s)K = t - 2

sK = t + 1

Adding both equations: K = t - 2 + t + 1 = 2t -1 → K = 2t -1.

Subtracting: (1 - s)K - sK = -2t +1 → K - 2sK = -2t +1 → K(1 - 2s) = -2t +1. But since K = 2t -1, substitute:

(2t -1)(1 - 2s) = -2t +1 → (2t -1)(1 - 2s) = -(2t -1)

If 2t -1 ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (2t -1):

1 - 2s = -1 → 2s = 2 → s = 1. But if s=1, then E is at C, which makes EB = sK = K = 2t -1, and CE = 0, which contradicts CE = t - 2. Hence, this case leads to contradiction unless 2t -1 = 0 → t = 0.5, but then CE = t - 2 = -1.5, which is invalid as length cannot be negative. Hence, this suggests that our assumption that E is between B and C is invalid.

Alternatively, if E is beyond C on line BC, then s > 1. In this case, |1 - s| = s -1 and |s| = s. So:

CE = (s -1)K = t - 2

EB = sK = t + 1

Again, adding: K = t - 2 + t + 1 = 2t -1

Subtracting: (s -1)K - sK = -2t +1 → -K = -2t +1 → K = 2t -1, which is consistent.

So from CE = (s -1)K = t - 2 and KB = sK = t + 1.

From K = 2t -1, we can substitute into CE: (s -1)(2t -1) = t - 2.

Also, from EB: s(2t -1) = t + 1 → s = (t + 1)/(2t -1).

Substituting s into the CE equation:

[(t + 1)/(2t -1) - 1]*(2t -1) = t - 2.

Simplify [(t +1 - (2t -1))/(2t -1)] * (2t -1) = t - 2 → (t +1 -2t +1) = t - 2 → (-t + 2) = t - 2 → -t + 2 = t - 2 → -2t = -4 → t = 2.

So t = 2. Then, CE = t - 2 = 0, which is invalid. Wait, this suggests CE = 0, which is impossible. What's wrong here?

Wait, if t = 2, then CE = 0, which would mean E coincides with C. But then, from s = (t +1)/(2t -1) = (2 +1)/(4 -1) = 3/3 = 1. So s = 1, which puts E at C. But then, ∠CDE would involve point E=C. Let me check if this satisfies the right angle condition.

If E=C, then ∠CDE is ∠CDD, which doesn't make sense. So this is invalid. Hence, contradiction again. What's happening here?

This suggests that under the assumption of the right angle at E, we still get contradictions. This indicates that there might be a fundamental error in my approach.

Let me revisit the problem statement. The user says: "If CE = t - 2. EB = t + 1, CD = 2, and CA = 10, find CE."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating with coordinates. Let me try using algebraic relations.

We have two expressions involving t: CE = t - 2 and EB = t + 1. Also, CD = 2, CA = 10.

Since D is on AC, and CD = 2, then AD = CA - CD = 10 - 2 = 8. So AD = 8.

Now, in triangle ADB, which is right-angled at D. So by Pythagoras: AB² = AD² + DB² → AB² = 64 + DB².

Also, in triangle CDE, right-angled at D: CE² = CD² + DE² → (t - 2)² = 4 + DE² → DE² = t² -4t.

Now, since E is on BC, and we have EB = t + 1, and CD = 2, perhaps we can relate DE to other segments?

But how? Let me think about triangle CDE and its relation to other parts.

Alternatively, since E is on BC, and we have DE, maybe we can express DE in terms of other variables.

But I need more relations. Let me consider triangle CDE and triangle ADB. Are there any connections between these triangles?

Alternatively, let me consider the entire figure. Points A, B, C, D, E with the given lines and right angles. Maybe using similar triangles or other properties.

Wait, since ∠ADB is right, and ∠CDE is right, and D is on AC, maybe there's a way to relate DB and DE via some proportionality?

Alternatively, using mass point or coordinate geometry with different setups.

Let me try to use coordinate geometry again, but this time allowing for general positions.

Let me place point C at (0, 0), point A at (10, 0) so that CA = 10. Point D is on AC, CD = 2, so D is at (2, 0). Now, since ∠ADB is right, and AD is from A(10,0) to D(2,0), which is horizontal. So BD must be vertical, hence B is at (2, b) for some b.

Now, E is on BC. Let me find coordinates of B as (2, b), C is (0,0). Line BC: from (2, b) to (0,0). Parametric equations: x = 2 - 2t, y = b - bt, where t ∈ [0, 1] for the segment BC.

Now, E is on this line, so let me denote E as (2 - 2t, b - bt).

Now, ∠CDE is right angle at D. So vectors DC and DE are perpendicular. DC is from D(2,0) to C(0,0): (-2, 0). DE is from D(2,0) to E(2-2t, b - bt): (2-2t -2, b - bt - 0) = (-2t, b - bt).

Dot product of DC and DE: (-2)(-2t) + 0*(b - bt) = 4t. For perpendicularity, this must be zero → 4t = 0 → t = 0. Hence, E is at t=0, which is point B(2, b). So again, this implies E=B, leading to EB = 0, which contradicts EB = t + 1.

This suggests that under this setup, it's impossible unless t = 0, which is invalid. Hence, there must be a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not at D but at E? Let me try that. Assume ∠CED is right angle at E. Then vectors EC and ED are perpendicular.

Vector EC is from E to C: (0 - x_E, 0 - y_E) = (-x_E, -y_E).

Vector ED is from E to D: (2 - x_E, 0 - y_E).

Their dot product: (-x_E)(2 - x_E) + (-y_E)(-y_E) = -2x_E + x_E² + y_E² = 0.

But E is on line BC. Let me express x_E and y_E in terms of parameter t. Let me use parameter s for line BC, where s=0 is B, s=1 is C.

So E is at (2 - 2s, b - bs). Then:

-2(2 - 2s) + (2 - 2s)^2 + (b - bs)^2 = 0.

As before, expanding this gives:

-4 + 4s + 4 -8s + 4s² + b² - 2b²s + b²s² = 0 → -4s + 4s² + b² - 2b²s + b²s² = 0.

Grouping terms:

s²(4 + b²) + s(-4 - 2b²) + b² = 0.

This quadratic in s: (4 + b²)s² - (4 + 2b²)s + b² = 0.

Solving for s using quadratic formula:

s = [4 + 2b² ± sqrt((4 + 2b²)^2 - 4*(4 + b²)*b²)] / [2*(4 + b²)]

Calculate discriminant:

Δ = (4 + 2b²)^2 - 4*(4 + b²)*b²

= 16 + 16b² + 4b^4 - 16b² - 4b^4

= 16 + 0 + 0 = 16

So s = [4 + 2b² ± 4]/[2*(4 + b²)]

Case 1: +4:

s = (4 + 2b² + 4)/[2(4 + b²)] = (8 + 2b²)/[2(4 + b²)] = (4 + b²)/(4 + b²) = 1

Case 2: -4:

s = (4 + 2b² - 4)/[2(4 + b²)] = (2b²)/[2(4 + b²)] = b²/(4 + b²)

So solutions are s=1 and s = b²/(4 + b²).

When s=1, E is at C, which makes CE=0, invalid. So we take s = b²/(4 + b²).

Now, let's express CE and EB in terms of s.

CE is the distance from C to E. Since E is on BC, and s is the parameter from B to C, with s=0 at B and s=1 at C. So CE = s * BC_length?

Wait, no. The parameter s here is such that when s=0, it's B, and s=1, it's C. So the length from B to E is s * BC_length, and from E to C is (1 - s) * BC_length? No, actually, the parameter s in the parametric equations defines the position along the line, but the actual distance depends on the direction vector.

Actually, the length from B to E is |BE| = s * |BC|, and from E to C is (1 - s) * |BC|. Wait, but the parameter s in the parametric equations is not necessarily proportional to distance unless the parameterization is by arc length. Here, the parametric equations are x = 2 - 2s, y = b - bs. So the direction vector is (-2, -b), so the length from B to E is s * sqrt(4 + b²). Similarly, from E to C is (1 - s) * sqrt(4 + b²).

Given that, CE = (1 - s) * sqrt(4 + b²), and EB = s * sqrt(4 + b²).

Given that CE = t - 2 and EB = t + 1, we have:

(1 - s)K = t - 2

sK = t + 1

Where K = sqrt(4 + b²).

Adding both equations: K = 2t - 1.

Subtracting: (1 - s)K - sK = -2t + 1 → K - 2sK = -2t + 1.

But K = 2t - 1, so:

(2t - 1) - 2s(2t - 1) = -2t + 1

Factor out (2t -1):

(2t -1)(1 - 2s) = -2t + 1 = -(2t -1)

Thus, if 2t -1 ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (2t -1):

1 - 2s = -1 → 2s = 2 → s = 1.

But s=1 gives E at C, which makes CE = 0, which is invalid. Hence, only possibility is 2t -1 = 0 → t = 1/2.

But if t = 1/2, then CE = t - 2 = -3/2, which is negative, impossible. Hence, no solution. This suggests that there is no valid t under these conditions, which contradicts the problem statement.

This indicates that there is no solution under the given constraints, which is impossible since the problem asks to find CE. Hence, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, let me go back to the original problem. The user says: "If CE = t - 2. EB = t + 1, CD = 2, and CA = 10, find CE."

Wait, perhaps there's a typo, and the right angles are at different points? Or maybe the right angle is at E in the second case? Let me assume that the right angle in the second case is at E, and see if that helps.

If ∠CDE is right angle at E, then we have the earlier equation leading to s = b²/(4 + b²). And from CE = (1 - s)K = t - 2, and EB = sK = t + 1.

With K = sqrt(4 + b²) = 2t - 1.

Also, from s = b²/(4 + b²), and K = sqrt(4 + b²), let's denote K = sqrt(4 + b²). Then, b² = K² - 4.

Substitute into s = (K² - 4)/K² = 1 - 4/K².

So s = 1 - 4/K².

But from earlier, s = (t + 1)/K, since EB = sK = t + 1 → s = (t + 1)/K.

So:

1 - 4/K² = (t + 1)/K.

Multiply both sides by K:

K - 4/K = t + 1.

But K = 2t - 1, so substitute:

(2t -1) - 4/(2t -1) = t + 1.

Let me solve this equation for t:

2t -1 - 4/(2t -1) = t + 1.

Bring all terms to left:

2t -1 - t -1 - 4/(2t -1) = 0 → t - 2 - 4/(2t -1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (2t -1):

(t - 2)(2t -1) - 4 = 0.

Expand:

2t(t) - t -4t + 2 -4 = 0 → 2t² -5t -2 = 0.

Wait, let me expand properly:

(t - 2)(2t -1) = 2t² - t -4t + 2 = 2t² -5t + 2.

So equation becomes:

2t² -5t + 2 -4 = 0 → 2t² -5t -2 = 0.

Solve using quadratic formula: t = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 16)] / 4 = [5 ± sqrt(41)] / 4.

These are irrational numbers, but the answer choices are integers. This suggests that this approach is not yielding integer t, which contradicts the answer choices. Hence, this indicates a problem.

At this point, it seems like there's a contradiction in the problem setup, or perhaps a miscalculation. Given the time spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me recall that in the beginning, we have CD = 2, CA = 10, so AD = 8. In right triangle ADB, with AD = 8, and right angle at D. Let me denote DB as x. Then AB² = AD² + DB² = 64 + x².

Also, in triangle CDE, right-angled at D, with CD = 2, CE = t-2, so DE = sqrt(CE² - CD²) = sqrt((t-2)^2 - 4).

Now, since E is on BC, and we have EB = t + 1, and CD = 2, perhaps there's a relationship between DE and EB?

Let me consider triangle BDE. If I can find DE in terms of EB, or relate it to other segments.

But without knowing the position of E, it's hard to say. Alternatively, since E is on BC, and DE is a segment from D to E, perhaps using coordinates again.

Let me try to use vectors or coordinate geometry with a different setup. Let me place point D at (0,0), since CD = 2, and D is on AC. Let me set up coordinate system with D at origin.

Let me set D at (0, 0). Since CD = 2, and D is on AC, let me set C at (2, 0), so that CD = 2 units. Then, A is on the line extending from C through D. Let me assume AC is a straight line, so A is on the opposite side of D from C. Let me set A at (-8, 0), since CA = 10. So from C(2, 0) to D(0, 0) is 2 units, and from D(0, 0) to A(-8, 0) is 8 units, making CA = 10.

Now, ∠ADB is right angle. Point D is at (0,0), A is at (-8, 0). So line AD is from A(-8,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal.
