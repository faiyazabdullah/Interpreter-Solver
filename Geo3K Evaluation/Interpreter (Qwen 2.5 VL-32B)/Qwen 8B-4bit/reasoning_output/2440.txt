MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, we have two rectangles: one is ABCD and the other is AEFG. Both share the point A. The problem mentions similarity between these two polygons, so that's a key point. Also, there are several length measurements and some angles given. The main question is asking for the measure of angle ADC. Let me jot down all the given data first.

Given:
- Rectangle ABCD: So AB, BC, CD, DA are sides. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles (90 degrees). But wait, the problem says that Angle(A,B,C) is a right angle, same for others. So that checks out.
- Rectangle AEFG: Similarly, AE, EF, FG, GA are sides. Again, right angles at each corner.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all points. Lines connecting them form the rectangles.
- Specific lengths:
  - AB = 26
  - AD = 12
  - DG = 4.5
  - GF = 14
  - EF = 8
  - BE = AB - EF = 26 - 8 = 18? Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), Sub(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(E,F)))). So BE is AB minus EF, which is 26 - 8 = 18. That gives us BE = 18.
- Angles:
  - Measure of angle AGF is 108 degrees. So angle at G between A-G-F is 108°.
- Similarity between polygons ABCD and AEFG. So corresponding angles are equal, and sides are proportional.

Now, the goal is to find m∠ADC. In rectangle ABCD, angle ADC is one of the corners. Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles are 90°, but wait—that seems conflicting because if the problem is asking for angle ADC, maybe there's more to it? Wait, no—wait, hold on. Wait, angle ADC would normally be a right angle since ABCD is a rectangle. But the answer choices don't include 90°, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't about the standard rectangle? Or perhaps there's a mistake in my assumption. Let me check again. The problem states that ABCD is a rectangle, so angle ADC should be 90°, but none of the options are 90. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, looking back, the problem says that Polygon A B C D ~ Polygon A E F G. So they are similar. But since they are both rectangles, their angles are all right angles. However, the similarity ratio would mean that their sides are proportional. But the problem also gives some angle measures, like angle AGF is 108°, which suggests that maybe the second polygon AEFG is not a rectangle? Wait, no—the problem says Rectangle(A,E,F,G), so AEFG is a rectangle. Then angle AGF should be 90°, but according to the given data, it's 108°. Contradiction. Hmm, that can't be. There's a contradiction here. Wait, but the problem says that the angle AGF is 108°, which is part of the given data. How does that fit with AEFG being a rectangle?

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Let me re-examine the given predicates. The user provided:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C))
- RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))
- RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A))
- RightAngle(Angle(D,A,B))
Similarly for the other rectangle:
- RightAngle(Angle(A,E,F))
- RightAngle(Angle(E,F,G))
- RightAngle(Angle(F,G,A))
- RightAngle(Angle(G,A,E))

But then, the problem also states that MeasureOf(Angle(A,G,F)) = 108. So angle at G between A-G-F is 108°, but according to the predicates, Angle(F,G,A) should be a right angle. This is a contradiction unless the predicates are incorrect or misinterpreted. Wait, but the problem says that Rectangle(A,E,F,G), so all angles in AEFG should be right angles. But the given angle AGF is 108°, which contradicts that. Therefore, either the problem has an error, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates. Alternatively, perhaps the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle? Wait, the angle AGF would be part of the rectangle AEFG. Because AEFG is a rectangle, so angle at G should be 90°, but the given measure is 108°. So this seems impossible. Unless the problem is not stating that AEFG is a rectangle, but that it's a parallelogram? Or maybe the given angle is not part of the rectangle? Wait, the initial predicates say Rectangle(A,E,F,G), so that's a rectangle. So angle AGF should be 90°, but the problem says it's 108°. That's confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps the angle mentioned is not part of the rectangle? Let me check again the given data.

Looking at the list of predicates:

- Line(A,G)
- Line(G,F)
- Angle(G,A,E): which would be angle at A between G-A-E.
- Angle(A,G,F): angle at G between A-G-F. So this angle is supposed to be part of the rectangle AEFG. So in a rectangle, adjacent angles are 90°, but angle AGF is between lines GA and GF, which are adjacent sides of the rectangle. Hence, that angle should be 90°, but the given measure is 108°. This is conflicting. So there must be a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the problem is not that AEFG is a rectangle, but that the polygons are similar? Wait, the problem says "Polygon A B C D ∼ polygon A E F G", which means they are similar. So maybe AEFG is not a rectangle, but just a similar polygon to ABCD? But the problem also includes the predicate Rectangle(A,E,F,G). Wait, this is conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is combining both a rectangle and another shape. For example, ABCD is a rectangle, and AEFG is a quadrilateral that is similar to ABCD, but not necessarily a rectangle. But then why is there a Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate? That would imply AEFG is a rectangle. But then the angle AGF is given as 108°, which conflicts. So there must be a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle? But the way the lines are connected: A-E-F-G-A. So the sides are AE, EF, FG, GA. Thus, angle at G is between FG and GA, which are adjacent sides of the rectangle. Hence, it should be 90°. So the problem's given measure of 108° contradicts the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate. 

This inconsistency suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, but assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, maybe I need to reinterpret the given information. Let me try again. Maybe the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle AEFG, but part of another structure? Let me check the lines again. The lines given for AEFG are Line(A,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,A). So the rectangle AEFG has vertices A, E, F, G connected in order. So angle at G is between F-G-A. Which is indeed part of the rectangle. Therefore, the given measure of 108° for angle AGF implies that AEFG is not a rectangle, contradicting the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate. This is very confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle AGF refers to a different configuration. Wait, could there be a typo in the angle name? Like maybe it's angle AFG instead of AGF? Let me check. The predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(A,G,F)) = 108. So vertex at G, with segments GA and GF. So yes, that's angle at G between A-G-F. So that's definitely part of the rectangle AEFG. Hence, the contradiction remains. 

Wait, but the problem says that the polygons are similar. So if ABCD is a rectangle and AEFG is similar to it, then AEFG must also be a rectangle. Therefore, angle AGF must be 90°, but the problem says it's 108°. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle AEFG? Let me think again. The lines forming AEFG are A-E-F-G-A. So the sides are AE, EF, FG, GA. So the angle at G is between FG and GA, which are adjacent sides of the rectangle. So that angle should be 90°, but the problem says it's 108°. So this suggests that the given data may have conflicting information. But since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps there's an alternative interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle AEFG? Could there be a different configuration where AEFG is not a rectangle but still similar to ABCD? For instance, if AEFG is a parallelogram that is similar to ABCD, which is a rectangle. But then, for similarity, the angles must match. Since ABCD is a rectangle, all its angles are 90°, so AEFG must also have all angles 90°, making it a rectangle. Hence, angle AGF must be 90°, conflicting with the given 108°. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. Given that the problem includes both the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate and the MeasureOf(Angle(A,G,F)) = 108°, there's a contradiction. However, since the problem is posed, I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a resolution. Perhaps the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle? Or perhaps the angle is referring to a different structure? 

Alternatively, maybe the angle AGF is part of a different polygon, such as triangle AGF, which is not a rectangle. But then, the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate would require that AEFG is a rectangle. 

Wait, let me consider that maybe the problem uses the term 'rectangle' incorrectly, or there's a mislabeling. Suppose that AEFG is actually a different type of quadrilateral, not a rectangle, but the problem states it's a rectangle. This seems like a contradiction. 

Perhaps I need to ignore the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) predicate and focus on the similarity. The problem says that Polygon A B C D ~ Polygon A E F G. So they are similar. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AEFG must also be a rectangle, hence all angles are 90°, but the given angle AGF is 108°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's an inconsistency. 

But since the problem is given, and the answer choices exist, perhaps I need to proceed despite the contradiction, assuming that maybe the angle AGF is part of a non-rectangular quadrilateral, even though the predicate says it's a rectangle. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not part of the rectangle, but part of another structure. 

Let me try to set aside the contradiction and see if I can find another approach. The problem asks for angle ADC. In rectangle ABCD, angle ADC is 90°, but since that's not among the answer choices, there must be a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is not about rectangles but about similar polygons, and ABCD is not a rectangle? But the given predicates say Rectangle(A,B,C,D). 

Wait, maybe the problem is not about rectangles but about similar quadrilaterals. Let me check again. The given predicates include Rectangle(A,B,C,D) and Rectangle(A,E,F,G). So ABCD and AEFG are both rectangles. Hence, their angles are all right angles. But angle AGF is given as 108°, which is not a right angle. This is impossible. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle AGF is not part of the rectangle AEFG but of another figure. For example, if AEFG is a trapezoid or something else. But the predicate says it's a rectangle. 

At this point, I think there's an error in the problem statement, but since I have to work with it, I'll proceed under the assumption that perhaps the angle AGF is part of a different structure, and the Rectangle(A,E,F,G) is a red herring. Let me try focusing on the similarity and the given lengths. 

Since ABCD ~ AEFG, their corresponding sides are proportional. Let's denote the similarity ratio. Let me find the sides of both rectangles. 

For rectangle ABCD: 
AB = 26, AD = 12. So AB and AD are adjacent sides. Hence, the sides are AB=26, BC=AD=12, CD=AB=26, DA=BC=12. Wait, no—wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD, BC = DA. So if AB = 26 and AD = 12, then BC = AD = 12, CD = AB = 26. So the sides of ABCD are AB=26, BC=12, CD=26, DA=12. 

For rectangle AEFG: Need to find its side lengths. Given that EF = 8, GF = 14, and DG = 4.5. Wait, DG is part of the rectangle? Let me think. Point D is part of rectangle ABCD, and DG is given as 4.5. So D is connected to G via line DG. But how does G relate to the rectangle AEFG? 

Since AEFG is a rectangle, its sides are AE, EF, FG, GA. We know EF = 8, FG = 14. So EF and FG are adjacent sides of the rectangle. Hence, the sides of AEFG are EF = 8 and FG = 14. So the sides of AEFG are 8 and 14. 

But since ABCD ~ AEFG, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Let's assume that the correspondence is ABCD ~ AEFG. So AB corresponds to AE, BC corresponds to EF, CD corresponds to FG, DA corresponds to GA. 

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, AB and AD are adjacent sides. In rectangle AEFG, EF and FG are adjacent sides. So if the similarity is preserved, the ratio of AB/EF = AD/FG. 

Let's compute that ratio. AB = 26, EF = 8; AD = 12, FG = 14. So 26/8 = 12/14? Let's check: 26/8 simplifies to 13/4 = 3.25, while 12/14 = 6/7 ≈ 0.857. These are not equal. So the ratio is inconsistent. Hence, this suggests that the correspondence of sides might be different. 

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is AB corresponds to AE, BC corresponds to EF, CD corresponds to FG, DA corresponds to GA. But then, the ratio AB/AE = BC/EF = CD/FG = DA/GA. Let's try to find AE. 

We know that BE = AB - EF = 26 - 8 = 18. So BE = 18. Since B is a point on line AB (since Line(A,B) exists), and E is a point on line AE. Wait, but how are B and E related? 

Wait, the problem gives Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), Sub(...)). So BE is 18. So points B and E are connected by a segment of length 18. Now, since AB = 26, and BE = 18, then AE = AB - BE = 26 - 18 = 8? No, that would be if E were on the extension of AB beyond B, but we don't know the position of E. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the diagram.

Points A, B, C, D form a rectangle. Points A, E, F, G form another rectangle. They share point A. So AE is one side of the second rectangle. The line BE connects B to E, with length 18. Since AB = 26, and BE = 18, perhaps E is somewhere along a line extending from A or another direction. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, given that the rectangles are similar, their sides are proportional. Let's attempt to use the similarity ratio. 

Assuming that ABCD ~ AEFG, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be constant. Let's suppose that AB corresponds to AE, BC corresponds to EF, CD corresponds to FG, DA corresponds to GA. Then:

AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA.

From the given values:
AB = 26, BC = 12 (since DA = 12 and BC = DA in rectangle ABCD).
EF = 8, FG = 14.
So AB / AE = 26 / AE.
BC / EF = 12 / 8 = 3/2.
CD / FG = 26 / 14 = 13/7.
DA / GA = 12 / GA.

For similarity, all these ratios should be equal. Hence, 26/AE = 12/8 = 3/2, so 26/AE = 3/2 → AE = (26 * 2)/3 ≈ 17.333... But also, CD / FG = 26 / 14 = 13/7 ≈ 1.857, which doesn't equal 3/2 = 1.5. Hence, inconsistency again. So the correspondence of sides must be different.

Alternative correspondence: Maybe AB corresponds to AF, BC corresponds to FG, CD corresponds to GE, DA corresponds to EA. Not sure. This trial and error might not be effective. Let's try another approach.

Since the polygons are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. In rectangle ABCD, all angles are 90°, so AEFG must also have all angles 90°, which conflicts with the given angle AGF = 108°. Hence, the only possibility is that the given angle AGF is not part of the rectangle AEFG, implying that AEFG is not a rectangle. Therefore, the initial assumption that AEFG is a rectangle is incorrect, despite the given predicate. This suggests that the predicate Rectangle(A,E,F,G) might be erroneous or misapplied. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps the problem intended that AEFG is a parallelogram or another quadrilateral, and the similarity holds. Let me proceed under that assumption, ignoring the Rectangle predicate, since it leads to contradictions. 

So, assuming that AEFG is a quadrilateral similar to ABCD, which is a rectangle. Hence, AEFG is also a rectangle, but the given angle AGF is 108°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a fundamental issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle AGF is not an internal angle of the quadrilateral AEFG but of another figure. For example, if point G is connected to other points, creating a different angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle AGF refers to a triangle formed by points A, G, F. Let's consider triangle AGF. If it's a triangle, then angle at G is 108°, and sides AG and GF are known. From the given data, GF = 14, and we might need to find AG. 

But how? Let's see. In rectangle AEFG, if it were a rectangle, then AG would be equal to EF = 8. But since angle AGF is 108°, which is not 90°, it's not a rectangle. Hence, AEFG is likely a parallelogram, or another quadrilateral. 

Wait, if AEFG is similar to ABCD, which is a rectangle, then AEFG must be a rectangle, but the given angle contradicts that. Hence, the problem is flawed. However, since the problem is given, and I need to find an answer, I'll proceed by considering that AEFG is a parallelogram, similar to ABCD, and use the given angle. 

Assuming that AEFG is a parallelogram (since it's similar to a rectangle, which is a type of parallelogram), then opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Given that angle AGF is 108°, then the consecutive angle at F would be 180° - 108° = 72°. But since it's similar to a rectangle, which has all angles 90°, this doesn't align. 

Alternatively, since similarity preserves angles, if ABCD has all angles 90°, then AEFG must also have all angles 90°, so the given angle of 108° is invalid. This is a dead end. 

Maybe the problem involves a combination of rectangles and other shapes. Let me focus on the parts that make sense. 

We need to find m∠ADC. In rectangle ABCD, this is 90°, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is not about the rectangle but about a different angle. Wait, angle ADC is at point D, between points A-D-C. In rectangle ABCD, this is 90°, but if the rectangle is distorted, maybe it's not a rectangle anymore? But the problem states it is a rectangle. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves triangle ADC, and angle ADC is not a right angle? But in a rectangle, it must be. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach using the given data. 

Given that ABCD ~ AEFG. Let's assume that the similarity ratio is k. Let's find the ratio using known lengths. 

In rectangle ABCD, sides are AB = 26 and AD = 12. In rectangle AEFG, if it were a rectangle, its sides would be AE and EF, but EF is 8, and FG is 14. So if AEFG is a rectangle, then AE would be 14 and EF would be 8, or vice versa. But the given EF = 8, FG = 14. If it's a rectangle, then FG should be equal to AE. So AE = FG = 14. Then, the ratio of similarity would be AB/AE = 26/14 = 13/7. Also, AD/AF = 12/AF. But AF would correspond to EF = 8, so 12/8 = 3/2. These ratios are different, which implies inconsistency. 

But if AEFG is not a rectangle, but a parallelogram, then the sides would be AE and EF, with AE corresponding to AB or AD. Let's assume that ABCD ~ AEFG with correspondence AB -> AE, BC -> EF, CD -> FG, DA -> GA. 

Then, AB/EF = BC/FG = CD/GA = DA/AG. 

Wait, let's write equations:

AB = 26, EF = 8 → AB/EF = 26/8 = 13/4.

BC = 12, FG = 14 → BC/FG = 12/14 = 6/7.

These are not equal, so the correspondence is incorrect. 

Alternative correspondence: AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG. So AB/EF = BC/FG = 26/8 = 13/4, and 12/14 = 6/7. Still not matching. 

Another possibility: AB corresponds to FG, BC corresponds to GA. 

AB/FG = 26/14 = 13/7.

BC/GA = 12/GA. 

To match, 13/7 = 12/GA → GA = (12 * 7)/13 = 84/13 ≈ 6.46. 

Not sure if helpful. 

But we also have DG = 4.5. Point D is part of ABCD. How is G related to D? Line DG is given, with length 4.5. So from point D, there's a line to G, length 4.5. 

If we can express DG in terms of the similarity ratio, perhaps. Let me try. 

Assume that ABCD ~ AEFG with a certain ratio. Let's suppose that the correspondence is such that AD corresponds to AG. Since AD = 12, and AG is a side of AEFG. 

If AD corresponds to AG, then the ratio would be AD/AG = AB/AE = BC/EF = CD/FG. 

But we don't know AG or AE. However, we know that GF = 14, which would correspond to CD = 26 in ABCD. So if GF corresponds to CD, then GF/CD = 14/26 = 7/13. Hence, the similarity ratio would be 7/13. 

Thus, other corresponding sides would have the same ratio. For example, EF (which is 8) would correspond to BC = 12. So EF/BC = 8/12 = 2/3. But this ratio is different from 7/13, so inconsistency again. 

This suggests that the correspondence is not straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is such that AD corresponds to EF. AD = 12, EF = 8. Ratio 12/8 = 3/2. Then, AB corresponds to AE. AB = 26, so AE = AB * (EF/AD) = 26 * (8/12) = 26*(2/3) = 52/3 ≈ 17.333. 

Also, FG = 14 would correspond to BC = 12. So FG/BC = 14/12 = 7/6. But the ratio should be consistent, so 7/6 ≠ 3/2. Not matching. 

This is frustrating. Let me try to use the given BE = 18. Since BE is the length between B and E, and AB = 26. If E is a point such that BE = 18, then AE = AB - BE = 26 - 18 = 8? Only if E lies on the line extending from AB. But without knowing the configuration, it's hard to say. 

Assuming that E is on the line extending from A to B, then AE = AB - BE = 26 - 18 = 8. So AE = 8. If AE = 8, and EF = 8, then AE = EF = 8. So AEFG would have sides AE = 8, EF = 8, FG = 14, GA = ? 

But if AEFG is a rectangle, then AE = FG and EF = GA. So FG = AE = 8, but FG is given as 14. Contradiction. Hence, AEFG is not a rectangle. 

However, if AEFG is a parallelogram, then AE = FG and EF = GA. So FG = AE = 8, but FG is given as 14. Not matching. 

Wait, but FG = 14 is given. If AEFG is a parallelogram, then FG = AE. So AE = 14. But earlier calculation suggested AE = 8. Conflict. 

This suggests that the position of E is not on the line AB, but elsewhere. Let me consider coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to the points to make calculations easier. 

Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's define coordinates:

- A: (0, 0)
- B: (26, 0) since AB = 26
- D: (0, 12) since AD = 12
- C: (26, 12)

Now, point E is such that BE = 18. Let me find coordinates of E. But where is E located? It's part of the rectangle AEFG. Assuming that AE is one side of the rectangle, so E is somewhere such that AE is a side. 

Let me assume that AE is horizontal or vertical. But without knowing the orientation, it's difficult. Let's assume that AE is a horizontal line from A(0,0). Let's say E is at (x, 0), but then BE would be the distance from B(26,0) to E(x,0), which is |26 - x|. Given BE = 18, so |26 - x| = 18 → x = 26 - 18 = 8 or x = 26 + 18 = 44. So E could be at (8,0) or (44,0). 

If E is at (8,0), then AE = 8 units, which matches the previous calculation. Then, since AEFG is a quadrilateral similar to ABCD, which is a rectangle. So if AEFG is a rectangle, then from E(8,0), moving perpendicularly to AE to get F. Since AE is horizontal, the perpendicular direction would be vertical. So from E(8,0), moving up or down. Let's say upward, so F would be at (8, y). Then, EF = 8, so the length from E(8,0) to F(8,y) is |y - 0| = 8 → y = 8. So F is at (8,8). Then, FG would be horizontal from F(8,8) to G, and GA would connect back to A(0,0). 

But FG = 14, so from F(8,8), move horizontally to G. Since AEFG is a rectangle, FG should be equal to AE = 8. But FG is given as 14, which contradicts. Hence, this configuration is invalid. 

Alternatively, if E is at (44,0), then AE = 44, and BE = 26 - 44 = -18, but absolute value is 18. Then, from E(44,0), moving vertically to F(44, y). EF = 8, so y = 8 or -8. Assume y = 8, so F is at (44,8). Then FG would be horizontal from F(44,8) to G. Since AEFG is a rectangle, FG should be equal to AE = 44, but FG is given as 14. Again, conflict. 

Hence, this suggests that AE is not aligned with AB. Maybe AE is in a different direction. Let me consider that AE is not horizontal. Let me assume that AE is some vector from A(0,0) to E(x,y), with length AE = ?. We know BE = 18. 

Coordinates of B are (26,0). Coordinates of E are (x,y). Distance BE = sqrt((x-26)^2 + (y-0)^2) = 18. 

Also, since AEFG is a quadrilateral similar to ABCD (a rectangle), so the sides AE and EF should be perpendicular, and EF and FG should be perpendicular, etc. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is too vague. 

However, we also have DG = 4.5. Point D is at (0,12). Point G is part of the quadrilateral AEFG. Let me assume that G is at some coordinate (p,q). Then, distance DG = sqrt((p-0)^2 + (q-12)^2) = 4.5. 

Additionally, FG = 14. If F is at some point, and G is at (p,q), then distance FG = 14. 

This is getting too complex without more information. Let me try to use the similarity ratio. 

Since ABCD ~ AEFG, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let's say the ratio is k. 

Let me assume that AB corresponds to AE, BC corresponds to EF, CD corresponds to FG, DA corresponds to GA. 

Then, AB/AE = BC/EF = CD/FG = DA/GA = k. 

From given values:

AB = 26, BC = 12, CD = 26, DA = 12.

EF = 8, FG = 14, GA = ?

So:

26/AE = 12/8 = 26/14 = 12/GA.

From 12/8 = 26/14: 12/8 = 3/2, 26/14 = 13/7. These are not equal, so this correspondence is invalid. 

Try another correspondence: AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG. 

Then AB/EF = BC/FG => 26/8 = 12/14 → 13/4 = 6/7, which is false. 

Another possibility: AB corresponds to FG, BC corresponds to GA. 

AB/FG = BC/GA → 26/14 = 12/GA → GA = (12*14)/26 = 168/26 = 84/13 ≈ 6.46. 

Also, CD corresponds to AE, DA corresponds to EF. 

CD/AE = DA/EF → 26/AE = 12/8 → AE = (26*8)/12 = 208/12 = 52/3 ≈ 17.33. 

So now, we have AE = 52/3, GA = 84/13, FG = 14, EF = 8. 

Now, let's see if we can find DG. Point D is at (0,12). Point G is part of AEFG. To find DG, we need to find coordinates of G. 

Assuming AEFG is similar to ABCD, and the correspondence is AB -> FG, BC -> GA, CD -> AE, DA -> EF. 

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try to calculate coordinates. 

Assume point A is (0,0), B is (26,0), D is (0,12), C is (26,12). 

Let me assume that AEFG has sides AE, EF, FG, GA. With AE = 52/3, EF = 8, FG = 14, GA = 84/13. 

But how to find coordinates of G? 

Let me assume that AE is a vector from A(0,0) to E(x,y), with length AE = 52/3. 

But we also know that BE = 18. Point B is at (26,0). So the distance from B(26,0) to E(x,y) is 18: sqrt((x-26)^2 + y^2) = 18. 

Also, since AEFG is similar to ABCD, which is a rectangle, so AE and EF should be perpendicular. Hence, the vectors AE and EF are perpendicular. 

Vector AE is (x, y). Vector EF is (F_x - x, F_y - y). Their dot product should be zero: x*(F_x - x) + y*(F_y - y) = 0. 

But without knowing F's coordinates, this is challenging. 

Alternatively, since AEFG is similar to ABCD, which has sides AB=26 and AD=12, and the ratio is k = AB/FG = 26/14 = 13/7. So each side of AEFG is 13/7 times smaller than the corresponding side of ABCD. 

Wait, if the similarity ratio is k, then AE = k * AB? Or depends on correspondence. 

If the correspondence is such that AB corresponds to FG, then k = AB/FG = 26/14 = 13/7. 

Then, other sides would be:

AE = k * CD = 13/7 * 26 = 338/7 ≈ 48.2857.

EF = k * BC = 13/7 * 12 = 156/7 ≈ 22.2857.

GA = k * DA = 13/7 * 12 = 156/7 ≈ 22.2857.

But this contradicts the given EF = 8 and FG = 14. So this is not matching. 

This is extremely complex. Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradictions, perhaps I should focus on the angle ADC. 

In rectangle ABCD, angle ADC is 90°, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is asking about a different angle. Wait, maybe the question is not about the rectangle, but about a different polygon? Or perhaps the angle is not part of the rectangle but of another structure. 

Wait, the problem says "Find m∠ADC." In the rectangle ABCD, this is 90°, but since it's not an option, maybe the actual figure is not a rectangle, and the given Rectangle(A,B,C,D) is misleading? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle. 

Wait, maybe angle ADC is not the right angle, but another angle. For example, if the rectangle is transformed into a different shape due to the similarity, but the problem states it is a rectangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different angle, like the angle at D in the similar polygon? No, the question specifies angle ADC. 

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the given options and the information about the angle AGF being 108°, which is part of a similar polygon. 

Since the similarity ratio might involve the angle AGF = 108°, and angle ADC is part of the original rectangle, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles. For example, if the similarity transformation involves scaling and rotation, but since it's a similarity, angles remain the same. But in the original rectangle, all angles are 90°, so this doesn't help. 

Wait, but if the angle AGF is 108°, which is part of the similar polygon, and since similarity preserves angles, then the corresponding angle in the original rectangle would also be 108°, but that contradicts the rectangle having 90°. Hence, this suggests that the original polygon is not a rectangle, but the given predicate says it is. 

This is a paradox. Given the time I've spent without resolution, I'll choose the answer that fits with the given angle of 108°, possibly relating to the angle ADC being supplementary or something. For example, if angle AGF is 108°, and if there's a relationship with angle ADC, perhaps through some triangle or parallelogram. 

Alternatively, since the similarity ratio might involve the sides, and using the given lengths to calculate some trigonometric relation. 

Let me try to calculate the sides of the similar polygons. 

Assume that ABCD ~ AEFG with ratio k. Let's use the fact that DG = 4.5. Point D is (0,12) in our coordinate system. Point G is somewhere, and DG = 4.5. 

If I can find the coordinates of G, I can find the angle ADC. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Let me try to assume that AEFG is a parallelogram, and use the given lengths. 

Assume AEFG is a parallelogram, so AE || FG and EF || AG. 

Given that EF = 8, FG = 14. 

If the similarity ratio is such that ABCD ~ AEFG, then the sides of AEFG would be proportional. Let's say the sides of AEFG are a and b, with a/b = AB/AD = 26/12 = 13/6. 

Given that EF = 8 and FG = 14, which are adjacent sides of AEFG. So a = 8, b = 14, and a/b = 8/14 = 4/7, which is not equal to 13/6. Hence, this is inconsistent. 

But if the sides of AEFG are scaled by a factor k from ABCD, then a = k * AB or k * AD. Let's say a = k * AB = 26k, and b = k * AD = 12k. Then, a/b = 26k / 12k = 13/6. 

Given that a and b are 8 and 14, we have 8/14 = 4/7, which is not 13/6. Hence, no solution. 

This confirms the inconsistency. 

Finally, since I'm running out of ideas, and the angle AGF is 108°, which is part of a similar polygon, and the answer choices include 108° as option C, perhaps the desired angle is 108°. But why? 

Wait, if the similarity transformation preserves angles, and angle AGF is 108°, then the corresponding angle in ABCD would also be 108°, but in a rectangle, all angles are 90°. This is impossible. 

Unless the angle ADC is the corresponding angle to AGF, which is 108°. Hence, the answer would be 108°, option C. 

Even though this contradicts the rectangle property, perhaps the problem intends this, and the Rectangle predicate is misleading. 

Given that, I'll choose option C: 108°.
