MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question says that triangle EFG is equilateral, and EH bisects angle E. We need to find the measure of angle 2, which I assume refers to one of the angles formed by the bisector EH. Let me break it down step by step.

First, since triangle EFG is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and each angle should be 60 degrees. That's a key point. In an equilateral triangle, every angle is 60°, so angles at E, F, and G are all 60°. 

Now, EH is mentioned as bisecting angle E. Wait, angle E in the triangle is 60°, so if we bisect it, we split it into two equal parts. The bisector would divide the 60° angle into two angles of 30° each. But wait, the problem mentions angle 2. Maybe angle 2 refers to one of these resulting angles? Or perhaps there's more to it?

Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's also mention of angles like Angle(F,E,H) and Angle(G,E,H). So EH is a line from point E to point H, creating two angles at E: one between FE and HE, and another between HE and GE. Since EH bisects angle E, those two new angles should each be half of 60°, so 30° each. 

But the question asks for m∠2. Hmm, maybe angle 2 is referring to one of those bisected angles? But why would they label them as 2? Alternatively, could there be another angle involved here? Let me check the predicates again.

Looking at the given angles listed: Angle(F,E,G) is one of the original angles of the triangle, which is 60°, as it's part of the equilateral triangle. Then there's Angle(F,E,H) and Angle(G,E,H). These are the two angles created by the bisector EH. Since EH bisects angle E, those two angles should each be 30°, because the original angle was 60°, divided by 2. 

So if angle 2 refers to either of these angles, then the measure would be 30°, which corresponds to choice B. However, I need to make sure that angle 2 isn't referring to something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is referring to a different angle formed by some other intersection. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any other points or lines beyond E, F, G, H. The line EH is given, so H is a point connected to E. The other lines mentioned are EF, FG, EG, and EH. So the diagram probably has triangle EFG with EH splitting angle E into two 30° angles. Therefore, angles F-E-H and G-E-H are each 30°, making angle 2 likely one of those. Hence, the answer would be 30°, which is option B.

Wait, but let me confirm. The problem states that EH bisects angle E. So angle FEG is 60°, and EH splits it into two equal angles. Therefore, angles FEH and GEH are each 30°. If angle 2 is one of these, then the measure is 30. But the answer options have B as 30. So unless there's another angle in play, I think that's it.

Another thought: sometimes problems refer to angles labeled sequentially, like angle 1, angle 2, etc., depending on how the diagram is drawn. If the diagram shows EH splitting angle E, then angle 2 might be the angle adjacent to another part. But without seeing the diagram, we rely on the given predicates. The given angles include Angle(F,E,H) and Angle(G,E,H). The problem also mentions that the measures of these two angles are equal, which aligns with the bisector. So, each is 30°, hence angle 2 is 30°, answer B.
