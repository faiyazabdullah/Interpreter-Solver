MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,E), Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E). Also, there are right angles at Angle(A,E,B) and Angle(A,B,C). The lengths given are LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = 3, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = 2, LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 6, and LengthOf(Line(D,E)) = 2x - 3. We need to find x.

First, let me visualize the diagram. Since there are right angles at those angles, maybe we can think about right triangles here. The RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)) implies that at point E, the angle between lines AE and EB is 90 degrees. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) means at point B, the angle between AB and BC is 90 degrees. So, these two right angles suggest that triangles AEB and ABC are right-angled.

Wait, but looking at the lines: Line(A,E) and Line(E,B) form the right angle at E, so triangle AEB is a right triangle with legs AE and BE, and hypotenuse AB? Wait, no. Wait, the angle at E is between AE and EB. So the triangle would be A-E-B, making a right angle at E. Therefore, triangle AEB has a right angle at E, so AE and EB are perpendicular. Similarly, triangle ABC has a right angle at B, so AB and BC are perpendicular.

But also, there's a line from C to D and D to E. So maybe there's another structure here. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Starting with point A connected to E and B. Then B connected to C, and C connected to D, then D connected back to E. So the figure seems like a polygon connecting A-E-D-C-B-A? Or perhaps some other configuration. But since there are right angles at E and B, maybe it's forming rectangles or something?

Alternatively, maybe there are two separate right triangles connected through some points. Let me focus on the given lengths and see if I can find relations.

Given that AE = 3, AB = 2, BC = 6. And ED = 2x -3. Need to find x.

Let me check the triangles first. For triangle AEB, right-angled at E. So AE and EB are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse? Wait, but AB is given as length 2. However, AE is 3. Wait, that doesn't fit because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse should be longer than either leg. Here, AE is 3, AB is 2. That's impossible unless my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up. If the right angle is at E, then the sides adjacent to the right angle are AE and BE, and the hypotenuse would be AB. But if AE is 3 and AB is 2, then according to Pythagoras, AE² + BE² = AB². Plugging numbers: 3² + BE² = 2² → 9 + BE² = 4 → BE² = -5. Which is impossible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption about which sides are the legs and hypotenuse is incorrect. Maybe the right angle isn't between AE and EB, but another pair of lines? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)). The angle at E between A and B. So vertex at E, with segments EA and EB. So yes, the angle between EA and EB is the right angle. Thus, triangle AEB has a right angle at E, making EA and EB the legs, and AB the hypotenuse. But with AE=3 and AB=2, that leads to contradiction. Therefore, there's a problem here. How is this possible?

Wait, perhaps I misread the lines. Let me check again. The lines given are Line(A,E), Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E). So, the points are connected as follows:

- A connected to E and B
- B connected to C
- C connected to D
- D connected to E

So, the figure connects A-E-D-C-B-A? Or maybe a different shape. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Since there's a right angle at E between AE and EB, perhaps placing E somewhere such that AE is vertical and EB is horizontal. Wait, but AB is supposed to be length 2. Let me try to assign coordinates.

Assume point A is at (0,0). Since AE is a line of length 3, and the angle at E is right. Let me assume E is at (0,3), so that AE is along the y-axis. Then, since the angle at E is right between AE and EB, EB must be horizontal. So point B would be at (something, 3). But AB is length 2. Let me calculate coordinates.

Let’s say E is at (0,3). Then, line AE is from A(0,0) to E(0,3). Now, the right angle at E means that EB is horizontal, so from E(0,3), moving horizontally. Suppose point B is at (b, 3). Then, AB is the distance between A(0,0) and B(b,3). The length AB is sqrt((b)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(b² + 9). According to the problem, AB is 2. So:

sqrt(b² + 9) = 2 → b² + 9 = 4 → b² = -5. Again, impossible. Hmm. So this suggests inconsistency. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the right angle isn't between AE and EB. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)) means the angle at E between points A, E, B. So AE and BE meet at E, forming the right angle. So in that case, vectors EA and EB are perpendicular. So if point E is at (0,0), then A and B would be along axes. Wait, maybe I placed E incorrectly. Let me try again.

Alternative approach: Let me suppose that the right angle at E is between AE and BE. So vectors EA and EB are perpendicular. Let me use coordinate system where E is origin (0,0). Then, point A is somewhere, point B is somewhere else, such that EA and EB are perpendicular. Let me assign coordinates.

Let me set E at (0,0). Let’s say vector EA is along x-axis, so A is at (a, 0). Vector EB is along y-axis, so B is at (0, b). Then, the length AE is |EA| = a units. Given that AE = 3, so a = 3. So A is at (3, 0). Point B is at (0, b). Then, AB is the distance between (3,0) and (0,b), which is sqrt(3² + b²) = sqrt(9 + b²). But according to the problem, AB = 2. So sqrt(9 + b²) = 2 → 9 + b² = 4 → same issue. Still impossible. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction here. But the problem gives us these conditions, so maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the lines aren't directly connected as I thought. Let me re-examine the lines.

The lines given are:

Line(A,E)

Line(A,B)

Line(B,C)

Line(C,D)

Line(D,E)

So, connecting A-E, A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E. So the figure forms a pentagon-like shape? Or maybe some other configuration. Let me try to map the connections.

Points:

- A connected to E and B.

- B connected to C.

- C connected to D.

- D connected to E.

Thus, the figure is A-E-D-C-B-A. So, a quadrilateral AEDCBA? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a pentagon with points A, E, D, C, B connected in order. But regardless, the key thing is that there are right angles at E and B.

Wait, maybe the right angle at E is part of another triangle. For example, maybe triangle AED or something else. But the given right angles are specifically Angle(A,E,B) and Angle(A,B,C).

Wait, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between points A, B, C. So that's the angle between BA and BC. Given that, and since the right angle is there, BA and BC are perpendicular. So triangle ABC is right-angled at B. So AB is one leg, BC is another leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. But wait, AB is given as 2, BC is 6. So in triangle ABC, AB=2, BC=6, right-angled at B. Therefore, AC would be sqrt(2² + 6²) = sqrt(4+36)=sqrt(40)=2*sqrt(10). But how does this connect with the rest of the figure?

Now, considering the other right angle at E: Angle(A,E,B) is right. So triangle AEB is right-angled at E. So AE and BE are perpendicular. But earlier, trying to compute led to contradictions. So maybe there's more to the figure. Let me think about the entire structure.

Since there's a line from C to D and D to E, maybe there's a rectangle or square involved? Let me try to imagine points D and E. Since D is connected to C and E, and E is connected to A and D. So perhaps D is connected to E, which is connected to A, and C is connected to D. So maybe there's a rectangle involving points E, D, C, and another point? Or maybe a trapezoid?

Alternatively, maybe the figure includes both triangles AEB and ABC connected via some common side or structure. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a larger shape combining these elements. Let me consider coordinates again, but this time take into account all the given lengths.

Let me try to assign coordinates carefully. Let's start with triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B. Let me place point B at (0,0). Since AB=2 and BC=6, and angle at B is right, then AB is along one axis and BC along another.

Let me set B at (0,0). Let me take AB as horizontal. So point A is at (-2,0), since AB is length 2. Then, BC is vertical upwards from B(0,0) to C(0,6), since BC is length 6. So coordinates:

- B: (0,0)
- A: (-2, 0)
- C: (0,6)

Now, we need to incorporate the other points: E and D.

From the given lines, there's a line AE and a line BE. Since we have point E connected to A and to D. Also, line AE is given as length 3. Let's find coordinates for E.

In this setup, point A is at (-2,0). We need to find point E such that line AE has length 3. Also, the angle at E between A and B is right. So the angle between EA and EB is 90 degrees.

Let me denote E as (x,y). The condition that angle at E is right implies that vectors EA and EB are perpendicular. Vector EA is A - E = (-2 - x, 0 - y). Vector EB is B - E = (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Their dot product should be zero:

(-2 - x)(-x) + (0 - y)(-y) = 0  
=> x*(2 + x) + y^2 = 0  
=> 2x + x² + y² = 0 ... (1)

Also, the length of AE is 3. The distance between A(-2,0) and E(x,y) is sqrt[(x + 2)^2 + (y)^2] = 3. Squaring both sides:

(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 9 ... (2)

Now, expanding equation (1):

x² + 2x + y² = 0  
From equation (2): (x + 2)^2 + y^2 = x² + 4x + 4 + y² = 9  
Substitute x² + y² from equation (1) into equation (2):

From (1): x² + y² = -2x  
Plug into equation (2):

(-2x) + 4x + 4 = 9  
→ 2x + 4 = 9  
→ 2x = 5  
→ x = 5/2 = 2.5  

Then, substituting x=2.5 into equation (1):

(2.5)^2 + 2*(2.5) + y² = 0  
Calculating:

6.25 + 5 + y² = 0  
→ 11.25 + y² = 0  
→ y² = -11.25  

Which is impossible. Another contradiction! This suggests that there's a fundamental error in assumptions. What's going on?

Wait, maybe the right angle is not between EA and EB, but between EA and EB in a different way? Or perhaps my coordinate assignments are flawed. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not in the way I assumed. Let me re-examine the problem.

Another possibility: The lines given are Line(A,E), Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E). So, points A-E, A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E. So E is connected to A and D; D is connected to C and E; C connected to B and D; B connected to A and C; A connected to B and E. So the figure is a pentagon A-E-D-C-B-A. 

But with the right angles at E (between A-E-B) and at B (between A-B-C). So, the right angle at E involves points A, E, B. So, even though E is connected to A and D, the angle at E between A-E and B-E is right. Similarly, at B, angle between A-B and B-C is right.

But in my previous coordinate attempt, assuming B at (0,0), A at (-2,0), C at (0,6), and trying to find E such that AE=3 and angle at E is right, leads to a contradiction. Hence, there must be another approach.

Perhaps the key lies in the other part of the diagram involving point D and line DE. The length of DE is given as 2x-3, and we need to find x. So maybe there's a relation between DE and other parts of the figure.

Looking at the lines, C is connected to D, and D is connected to E. So, CD and DE are connected. If we can find the length of CD or some relationship involving DE, we might find x.

But how to find CD? Let me think. Maybe there's a rectangle or parallelogram formed by points C, D, E, and another point? Or maybe some similar triangles?

Alternatively, since there are right angles at E and B, maybe the figure contains squares or rectangles. Let me try again with coordinates, but this time consider the position of D.

Suppose we have points A, B, C as before: B at (0,0), A at (-2,0), C at (0,6). Now, need to find points D and E such that:

- D is connected to C and E.
- E is connected to D and A.
- The right angle at E between A-E-B.
- Also, the line DE has length 2x-3.

But how to find coordinates for E and D?

Earlier attempts showed inconsistencies, but perhaps I missed something. Let me try again with the right angle at E.

Let me denote E as (x,y). From the right angle at E, vectors EA and EB are perpendicular. As before, vector EA = A - E = (-2 - x, 0 - y), vector EB = B - E = (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Dot product is zero:

[(-2 - x)(-x)] + [(0 - y)(-y)] = 0  
→ x(2 + x) + y² = 0  
→ 2x + x² + y² = 0 ...(1)

Also, length AE is 3: sqrt[(x + 2)^2 + y²] = 3 → (x+2)^2 + y² = 9 ...(2)

Expanding equation (2): x² + 4x + 4 + y² = 9  
From equation (1): x² + y² = -2x  
Substituting into equation (2): (-2x) + 4x + 4 = 9 → 2x + 4 = 9 → 2x = 5 → x = 2.5. Then, plug x=2.5 into equation (1):

(2.5)^2 + 2*(2.5) + y² = 0 → 6.25 + 5 + y² = 0 → y² = -11.25. Still impossible.

This suggests that under the current setup, there's no real solution, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at E is not between EA and EB, but between EA and ED? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)), which is the angle at E between A-E-B, i.e., between EA and EB.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at E between BE and ED? But the predicate specifies Angle(A,E,B), so the angle at E between A-E-B. So it's between EA and EB.

This contradiction suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a crucial piece of information. Alternatively, maybe the figure isn't planar? Unlikely. Or perhaps the lines are not straight? No, the problem states they are lines.

Wait, maybe the length of AE is not 3, but something else? No, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 3). So that's fixed.

Wait, let's consider that maybe the right angle at E is not part of triangle AEB, but part of another triangle. Like, maybe triangle AED or BED? But the predicate explicitly mentions Angle(A,E,B), so it's about A-E-B.

At this point, I'm stuck. The given data seems contradictory. However, since this is a problem meant to be solved, there must be a way. Perhaps I made an error in interpreting the lines?

Wait, let me double-check the given lines. Are there five lines: AE, AB, BC, CD, DE. So, points A connected to E and B; B connected to C; C connected to D; D connected to E. So the points are A, E, D, C, B. So the figure is A-E-D-C-B-A, forming a pentagon. But with right angles at E and B.

Maybe there's a rectangle or other quadrilateral involving points E, D, C, and another point?

Alternatively, perhaps the figure consists of two right triangles connected at a common side. Let me think about triangle AEB and triangle ABC.

Wait, if I consider triangle ABC right-angled at B, with AB=2, BC=6, then AC is hypotenuse of length sqrt(2² + 6²) = sqrt(40). Now, if there's another triangle AEB right-angled at E, with AE=3. If I can find BE, then maybe there's a relationship between BE and other parts of the figure.

But earlier, using coordinates gave an impossible result. Maybe I need to consider that BE is part of another segment, like BD or something else?

Wait, there's a line from C to D and D to E. So, if I can express CD and DE in terms of other variables... But without knowing where D is, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the points D and E form a right angle or something. Wait, the problem doesn't mention any right angles involving D, except possibly through the lines.

Alternatively, since DE is part of the line from D to E, and we need to find its length as 2x-3, perhaps there's a way to relate DE to other parts using similarity or congruence.

Wait, maybe triangles AEB and CDE are similar? Or some other relationship?

Alternatively, since there are right angles at E and B, perhaps there's a way to use the Pythagorean theorem in some way.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Let's forget coordinates for a moment and look for relationships.

We know:

- In triangle AEB, right-angled at E, so AE² + BE² = AB². But AE is 3, AB is 2. So 3² + BE² = 2² → 9 + BE² = 4 → BE² = -5. Impossible. So this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or I've misinterpreted the configuration.

Wait, unless the right angle is not between AE and BE, but between AE and ED? No, the predicate says Angle(A,E,B), so it's between EA and EB.

Alternatively, could the right angle be at B, but between AB and BE instead of AB and BC? No, the predicate says Angle(A,B,C) is right, which is at B between AB and BC.

Wait, maybe the lines are not in the order I thought. Maybe the line from B to C is not directly connected to the right angle at B? No, the right angle is at B between AB and BC.

This is perplexing. Given that the problem provides this scenario, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the error is in assuming that the right angle at E is part of triangle AEB, but actually, it's part of another triangle, like AED or BED?

Wait, the angle at E is between A-E-B, so it's definitely part of triangle AEB. So the calculation should hold, but it doesn't. Hence, there's a contradiction.

Wait, let me check if the given lengths are swapped. For example, maybe AE is 2 and AB is 3? But the problem says AE=3, AB=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at A? No, the predicate says Angle(A,E,B), so at E.

Wait, perhaps the lines are not straight? No, they're defined as lines.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is three-dimensional? The problem doesn't specify, but typically geometry problems assume planar figures.

I'm stuck here. Given that this is a problem meant to be solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to think outside the box.

What if the right angle at E is not part of triangle AEB, but part of a different triangle involving D? For example, if there's a right angle at E between ED and EB, making triangle EBD right-angled at E? But the predicate says Angle(A,E,B), so it's about A-E-B.

Wait, perhaps the lines AE and BE are not the legs but one is a leg and the other is a hypotenuse? But in a right angle, the sides forming the angle are the legs.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is not AEB but another triangle. For example, if there's a triangle involving E, D, and another point?

Wait, the problem mentions IsSideOf(Line(A,E), Triangle(A,E,B)), which means that line AE is a side of triangle AEB. Similarly, line AB is a side of triangle AEB. So triangle AEB has sides AE, EB, and AB. So the right angle is at E, making AE and EB the legs, AB the hypotenuse. But with AE=3, AB=2, which is impossible.

Unless the length of AB is not the hypotenuse? But in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always the longest side. If AE=3 and AB=2, then AB cannot be the hypotenuse. So this suggests that the right angle is at B, not at E. But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)), which is at E.

This is very confusing. Given that the problem is from a test, it's likely that there's a simple solution, and I'm missing something.

Wait, let me try to ignore the coordinate approach and focus on the given lengths and relationships.

We have two right triangles: AEB and ABC.

For triangle ABC, right-angled at B: AB=2, BC=6. So AC = sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt(4 + 36) = sqrt(40) = 2√10.

For triangle AEB, right-angled at E: AE=3, BE=?, AB=2. Using Pythagoras: AE² + BE² = AB² → 9 + BE² = 4 → BE² = -5. Still impossible.

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that either the problem is faulty, or there's a different interpretation.

Wait, what if the right angle at E is not between AE and BE, but between AE and ED? But the predicate says Angle(A,E,B), so it's between A-E-B.

Wait, perhaps the line EB is not part of the triangle AEB, but another line? No, the predicate says IsSideOf(Line(A,E), Triangle(A,E,B)), so AE is a side, AB is a side, and EB is the third side.

This is really puzzling. Given that, perhaps the error is in the assumption that both triangles are right-angled? Or maybe the lengths are different?

Wait, let me read the problem again to make sure I didn't misread anything.

GIVEN:

- Points A, B, C, D, E.

- Lines: A-E, A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E.

- RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)): angle at E between A-E-B.

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): angle at B between A-B-C.

- Lengths: AE=3, AB=2, BC=6, DE=2x-3.

Triangles: AEB and ABC.

Other predicates: IsSideOf(...) for the lines in the respective triangles.

So, the problem is consistent in stating that, but mathematically, it leads to a contradiction. This suggests that perhaps there's a different configuration where the right angles are not part of the triangles as I thought.

Wait, maybe the right angle at E is part of a different triangle, like AED or BED? For example, if there's a right angle at E between AE and ED, making triangle AED right-angled at E. But the predicate specifies Angle(A,E,B), so it's between A-E-B.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle at E is between BE and ED, making triangle BED right-angled at E. But again, the predicate specifies Angle(A,E,B).

This is very confusing. Since I'm unable to resolve the contradiction, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that there's a miscalculation in my earlier steps.

Wait, let me try once more with coordinates, but this time allowing for negative coordinates.

Let me place E at (0,0). Then, since AE=3, point A is somewhere at distance 3 from E. Let me choose A at (3,0). Now, the right angle at E between A-E-B means that EB is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is from E(0,0) to A(3,0), direction along x-axis. So EB must be vertical. Let me set B at (0, b). Now, AB is the distance between A(3,0) and B(0,b), which is sqrt(3² + b²) = sqrt(9 + b²). Given AB=2, so sqrt(9 + b²) = 2 → 9 + b² = 4 → b² = -5. Again, impossible.

Same result. So no matter how I place the points, this leads to a contradiction. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at E is not part of triangle AEB, but part of another triangle involving D? For example, if there's a triangle EBD or something else? But the predicate specifies Angle(A,E,B).

Alternatively, maybe the right angle at E is between AE and ED, and the predicate is mistyped? If that were the case, then we could proceed. Let me explore this possibility.

Assume that the right angle at E is between AE and ED, making triangle AED right-angled at E. Then, AE=3, ED=2x-3, and AD would be the hypotenuse. But we don't know AD. However, we also have AB=2, BC=6, and other lines.

But without knowing how D relates to other points, it's hard to proceed. However, since the problem asks for x, and DE is given as 2x-3, perhaps there's a way to relate DE to other lengths.

Alternatively, since there's a line from C to D and D to E, perhaps CD is parallel to AB or something, creating similar triangles?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a rectangle or some other quadrilateral. For example, if points A, B, C, D, E form a rectangle with extensions.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects ignoring the contradiction and proceeding with the equations, leading to x.

Wait, let's try to proceed despite the contradiction. From the earlier equations, we had x = 2.5, which led to y² = -11.25. But if we proceed formally, perhaps there's a way to relate DE to this.

Point D is connected to C and E. Assuming C is at (0,6) as before, and E is at (2.5, y), where y² = -11.25. But since y is imaginary, this suggests that in real plane, no such point exists. Hence, the problem is inconsistent.

However, since this is a math problem, perhaps there's an alternative approach. Let me think about the length DE = 2x-3. Maybe there's a way to find DE using other information, even if the earlier parts are contradictory.

For instance, if we consider that in triangle ABC, AC = sqrt(40). If there's a connection between AC and DE, perhaps through some proportionality or similarity.

Alternatively, since DE is part of the line from D to E, and D is connected to C, maybe CD is parallel to AB or something.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. Let me assume that CD is parallel to AB. If AB is length 2, and CD is some length, but I don't know.

Alternatively, since BC=6 and CD is part of the line from C to D, perhaps CD is equal to some other length.

Alternatively, since the problem provides DE = 2x-3, and we need to find x, perhaps there's a way to express DE in terms of known quantities.

But without knowing the position of D, it's unclear. Given that I'm stuck, maybe the intended solution assumes that the earlier contradiction is overlooked, and proceeds to use the lengths in some way.

Wait, let me think about the right triangles. Even though the earlier calculation leads to an impossible situation, maybe the problem intends for us to proceed formally.

For example, in triangle AEB, right-angled at E, with AE=3 and AB=2, we can write BE = sqrt(AB² - AE²) = sqrt(4 - 9) = sqrt(-5), which is imaginary. But if we ignore the imaginary part and proceed, perhaps BE = sqrt(5)i, and then use some other relation.

But this seems too abstract. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and AB is 3, AE is 2? Let me try swapping them.

If AE=2 and AB=3, then in triangle AEB, right-angled at E, AE=2, AB=3, so BE = sqrt(3² - 2²) = sqrt(5). Then, with BE=sqrt(5), and assuming some relation to other parts.

But the problem states AE=3, AB=2, so this is speculative.

Assuming that there was a typo and AB=3, AE=2, then BE=sqrt(5). Then, perhaps there's a way to relate DE to this.

But since the problem states AB=2, I can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at A? Let me try that. If the right angle is at A between E-A-B, then AE and AB are perpendicular. With AE=3, AB=2, then triangle AEB would have legs 3 and 2, hypotenuse sqrt(13). Then, BE would be sqrt(13). But this changes the configuration.

But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)), which is at E, not at A. So this is invalid.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing a critical insight. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A.5, B.6, C.8, D.9, perhaps there's a way to relate DE to the other lengths using some proportional reasoning.

Let me consider that DE is part of a right triangle. For example, if DE is part of a right triangle with CD and CE. But without knowing CD or CE, this is difficult.

Wait, from point C, there's a line to D, and D to E. If I can find CD and CE, then DE could be found via Pythagoras if it's a right triangle.

But how to find CD and CE?

Alternatively, since BC=6, and C is connected to D, maybe CD is parallel to AB or something. If AB is 2, and BC is 6, and if CD is parallel to AB, then CD would be some length, but without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, if the figure is a rectangle, then CD would be equal to AB, but this is speculation.

Alternatively, since there's a right angle at B between AB and BC, and at E between AE and EB, perhaps the figure is composed of two right triangles joined at a common side.

But without knowing how they are joined, it's unclear.

Given that I'm stuck, let me try to think about the answer choices. The options are 5, 6, 8, 9. Let me assume that DE = 2x-3, and try to find x such that DE is a positive length.

If I assume that DE is part of a right triangle where DE is one leg, and another length is known.

For example, if DE is part of a right triangle with CD and CE. But without knowing CD or CE, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, since BC=6 and CD is connected to C, maybe CD is 6? If CD=6, and DE is part of a right triangle with CD and CE, but again, no info.

Alternatively, since AE=3, AB=2, BC=6, maybe DE is related to these via some formula.

Wait, let me try to assume that the figure is a rectangle AEDC, with AE=3, ED=2x-3, DC=AB=2, and EC=BC=6. But this is pure speculation.

If AEDC is a rectangle, then AE and DC would be opposite sides, so DC=AE=3. But DC is connected to C, which is part of BC=6. So DC=3, but BC=6. Then, if DC=3 and BC=6, maybe there's a relationship. But how?

If D is such that DC=3, and C is connected to B with BC=6, then perhaps BD is 3? Not sure.

Alternatively, if DE is part of a right triangle with DC=6 and DE=2x-3, then if it's a right triangle, DE² + DC² = EC². But EC would be a diagonal, but without knowing EC, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, if EC is the hypotenuse, and EC is related to other lengths. For example, if EC is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs DE and DC, then DE² + DC² = EC².

But without knowing EC, this is still not helpful.

At this point, I think I need to give up and make an educated guess based on the answer choices. Let me assume that the problem expects us to use the Pythagorean theorem on the lengths given, ignoring the contradiction, and solve for x.

For example, if we consider that in triangle AEB, even though it's impossible, we could proceed formally:

AE=3, AB=2, so BE = sqrt(AB² - AE²) = sqrt(4 - 9) = sqrt(-5). Then, perhaps there's a relation between BE and DE.

If DE is related to BE, say DE = BE, then 2x-3 = sqrt(-5), which is not possible. Or if DE is some function of BE.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving DE and BE, like triangle BDE, but without knowing angles or other sides, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if DE is part of a right triangle with BE and some other length.

Without further information, it's impossible to proceed. Given that, and the fact that the answer choices are integers, let me try plugging in the options to see which one makes DE a positive number.

DE = 2x -3. For DE to be positive, 2x -3 > 0 → x > 1.5. All options satisfy this.

But how to determine x?

If I assume that DE is equal to BE, which in the impossible scenario is sqrt(-5), but taking absolute value, maybe x is chosen so that 2x-3 = sqrt(5). Solving 2x-3 = sqrt(5) → x = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, if DE is equal to BC=6, then 2x-3 = 6 → 2x = 9 → x=4.5, not in options.

If DE is equal to AB=2, then 2x-3=2 → x=2.5, not in options.

If DE is equal to AE=3, then 2x-3=3 → x=3, not in options.

None of these match the options. Hence, this approach is invalid.

Another idea: Maybe DE is part of a triangle with BC=6 and some other side. For example, if triangle CDE is right-angled, and DE=2x-3, CD=6, and CE is some length. But without knowing CE, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if CD is parallel to AB, and DE is parallel to BC, forming a parallelogram. If CD=AB=2, and DE=BC=6, then DE=6, so 2x-3=6 → x=4.5, still not in options.

Alternatively, if DE is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs BC=6 and CD=2, then DE = sqrt(6² + 2²) = sqrt(40) = 2√10 ≈ 6.324. So 2x-3 = 2√10 → x = (3 + 2√10)/2 ≈ (3 + 6.324)/2 ≈ 4.662, not in options.

Alternatively, if DE is the hypotenuse of a triangle with legs AE=3 and BC=6, then DE = sqrt(3² + 6²) = sqrt(45) = 3√5 ≈ 6.708. Then 2x-3 = 3√5 → x = (3 + 3√5)/2 ≈ (3 + 6.708)/2 ≈ 4.854, not in options.

Still no match. Given that, and since I'm out of ideas, I'll have to guess based on the answer choices. The options are 5, 6, 8, 9. Let me try x=5: DE=2*5-3=7. x=6: DE=9, x=8: 13, x=9:15. None of these seem to relate directly to the given lengths.

Wait, but if I consider that in the impossible scenario, BE² = -5, and if DE is somehow related to BE, like DE = 2*BE, then DE = 2*sqrt(5) ≈ 4.472, which is not in options. Or if DE = BE², then DE = 5, so 2x-3=5 → x=4, not in options.

Alternatively, if the problem has a typo and the length of AE is 2 instead of 3, and AB is 3, then in triangle AEB, BE = sqrt(3² - 2²) = sqrt(5). Then, if DE is related to BE, say DE = BE, then 2x-3 = sqrt(5) → x = (3 + sqrt(5))/2, still not matching.

Alternatively, if DE is twice BE, then 2x-3 = 2*sqrt(5) → x = (3 + 2√5)/2 ≈ (3 + 4.472)/2 ≈ 3.736, not in options.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that I'm missing a key insight, and the correct answer is likely B.6, but I'm not sure. Given the lack of better options, I'll choose B.
