<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

We have a Hexagon(W,X,Y,Z,W,E,F). Wait, hexagons typically have six vertices, but here it's listed as W,X,Y,Z,W,E,F? That seems like seven points, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. But since it's called a hexagon, perhaps some points are repeated? Or maybe it's a typo, and it should be Hexagon(W,X,Y,Z,A,B)? But the given points are W, X, Y, Z, W, E, F. Hmm, maybe the hexagon has vertices W, X, Y, Z, then back to W? No, that would make a quadrilateral. Wait, maybe the hexagon is W-X-Y-Z-E-F-W? So the vertices are W, X, Y, Z, E, F connected in order. That would make a hexagon with those six points. So the hexagon is W, X, Y, Z, E, F connected sequentially. 

Then we have Point(W), Point(X), etc., which just confirms each of these letters represents a point. Then Line(W,X) is mentioned twice, so that's redundant. Then Line(E,F), Line(W,F). Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,F)), 10.5) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(W,F)), 14). So EF is 10.5 units long, and WF is 14 units. 

Also, Congruent(Line(W,X), Line(W,X))—which is trivial because a line segment is congruent to itself. Similarly, Parallel(Line(W,X), Line(W,X))—again, trivial. So those probably aren't giving us new info. 

But there's also SymmetricAboutVerticalAxis(Hexagon(...)). So the entire hexagon is symmetric about a vertical axis. That means if we draw a vertical line through the center of the hexagon, it should divide it into two mirror images. 

Now, the question is to find x. But wait, where is x defined? Oh, maybe x refers to a length or a variable in the problem? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the answer choices are A-D, and the question says "Find x." But in the given predicates, I don't see any mention of x except possibly in the variables. Wait, maybe x is referring to the length of another side, perhaps WX? Because in the hexagon, the sides are W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-E, E-F, and F-W? Or maybe not. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, the hexagon is named Hexagon(W,X,Y,Z,W,E,F). So the vertices are W, X, Y, Z, then W again? That doesn't seem right. Maybe the hexagon is W, X, Y, Z, E, F connected in order. So the edges are W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to E, E to F, and F back to W. Therefore, forming a hexagon with those six vertices. 

So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZE, EF, FW. Now, we know EF = 10.5 and FW = 14. Also, the hexagon is symmetric about a vertical axis. Since it's symmetric, certain sides must be equal. For example, if we consider the vertical axis, then the left and right sides should mirror each other. 

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose the vertical axis passes through the midpoint of the hexagon. Let's assume that the vertical axis goes through the middle of the hexagon. Given that the hexagon is symmetric, if we reflect over this vertical axis, the points should map onto each other. 

Looking at the vertices: W, X, Y, Z, E, F. Let's suppose that the vertical axis divides the hexagon such that points on one side are mirrored to the other. For instance, if W is on the left, then its mirror image would be on the right. Similarly for other points. However, without knowing the exact coordinates, it's challenging, but maybe we can use the given line segments.

We have Line(W,X) and Line(W,F). Wait, Line(W,F) connects W to F. Also, Line(E,F) is given as 10.5. Also, Line(W,F) is 14. 

Since the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, maybe some of the sides are equal. For example, if the hexagon is symmetric, then opposite sides might be equal. But how does that fit with the given data?

Alternatively, considering the symmetry, perhaps certain points are reflections of others. For example, if the vertical axis is the y-axis, then points on the left side have corresponding points on the right. Suppose W and F are positioned such that reflecting over the vertical axis swaps them? Or maybe W and E are symmetric? Not sure yet.

Another thought: since the hexagon is symmetric about a vertical axis, then the horizontal distances from the axis must balance. For example, if we have a vertical axis, then for every point on the left, there's a mirror image on the right. 

Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's assume the vertical axis is the y-axis. Let me place point W somewhere on the left, say at (-a, b), and its mirror image would be at (a, b). But since the hexagon is symmetric, other points must also be placed accordingly. 

But maybe there's another way. Let's look at the given line segments. We know EF = 10.5 and WF = 14. Also, since the hexagon is symmetric, maybe triangle WFE is part of the hexagon? Wait, EF is one side (from E to F), and WF is another side (from W to F). So connecting points W, F, and E forms a triangle. 

In triangle WFE, we know EF = 10.5 and WF = 14. But we need more information to find another side or an angle. However, maybe due to the symmetry, there's something else. 

Wait, the hexagon being symmetric about the vertical axis implies that certain sides are equal. For example, if the vertical axis cuts through the middle, then the sides on either side are mirrors. Suppose that the side WX is mirrored to another side. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe the line WX is horizontal? If the hexagon is symmetric vertically, then WX could be horizontal, making the vertical axis pass through its midpoint. But again, not sure. 

Alternatively, since the hexagon is symmetric, maybe the distance from W to the axis equals the distance from another point to the axis. For example, if W is on the left, then there's a point on the right that's its mirror. 

But perhaps we need to consider the triangle formed by W, E, and F. Let's think about triangle WEF. In this triangle, we know two sides: WF = 14 and EF = 10.5. But we need more information. Unless there's another relationship. 

Wait, but maybe the triangle is a right triangle? If the hexagon's symmetry creates right angles. Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and FE are parallel or something. 

Wait, the problem mentions that Line(W,X) is congruent to itself and parallel to itself. Which isn't helpful. But the hexagon being symmetric might imply that some sides are parallel. For example, if the hexagon is symmetric, maybe WX is parallel to FE, or something like that. 

Alternatively, if the hexagon is symmetric, then certain angles are equal. But without knowing the type of hexagon (regular or irregular), it's tricky. But since it's not specified as regular, it's likely irregular. 

Wait, but the fact that it's symmetric about a vertical axis suggests that maybe it's a trapezoid or some other shape. Wait, but a hexagon with vertical symmetry... Maybe it's composed of two trapezoids? 

Alternatively, think of the hexagon as having pairs of equal sides due to symmetry. For example, if WX is mirrored to another side, maybe ZE? Or maybe YZ is mirrored to another side. 

But how does this relate to the given lengths? Let's think again. We have EF = 10.5 and WF = 14. If the hexagon is symmetric, then perhaps there's another segment equal to EF. For instance, if the hexagon is symmetric, then maybe another side is also 10.5. But which one? 

Alternatively, maybe the line WX is equal to another line due to symmetry. But without knowing which lines correspond, it's unclear. 

Wait, another idea: Since the hexagon is symmetric about a vertical axis, the vertical axis passes through the midpoints of certain sides. For example, if the vertical axis is the perpendicular bisector of a side, then that side is horizontal. 

Suppose that the vertical axis is the perpendicular bisector of side WX. Then WX would be horizontal. Similarly, if the axis is the perpendicular bisector of another side, like EF. But if EF is 10.5, then if it's horizontal, its midpoint lies on the vertical axis. 

Alternatively, if the vertical axis passes through the midpoint of EF and the midpoint of WX. But how does that help? 

Wait, but we also have the line WF = 14. If the vertical axis is the perpendicular bisector of WF, then WF would be horizontal, and its midpoint is on the axis. But then, if the axis is the same for other sides. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe we need to focus on triangle WEF. In triangle WEF, we have two sides: WF=14 and EF=10.5. If we can find the third side or an angle, we can apply the Law of Cosines or something. But how? 

Wait, maybe the triangle is a right triangle. If that's the case, then we can use Pythagoras. Let me check: 10.5 squared plus something squared equals 14 squared. Let me compute 10.5^2 = 110.25, 14^2 = 196. So the missing side would be sqrt(196 - 110.25) = sqrt(85.75) ≈ 9.26, which isn't among the options. So maybe not a right triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. Wait, if the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, then maybe the line WF is symmetrical to another line. For example, if there's a reflection across the vertical axis that maps W to another point, say E, and F to another point. 

Assuming that the vertical axis is the axis of symmetry, then the reflection of W over the vertical axis would be a point, say, E. Because the hexagon includes points W, X, Y, Z, E, F. If W reflects to E, then the line WE would be vertical? Or maybe the line WF reflects to another line. 

Alternatively, if the vertical axis passes through the midpoint of EF and the midpoint of WX. Let's assume that. So, the midpoint of EF is M, and the midpoint of WX is N. These two midpoints lie on the vertical axis. 

But without coordinates, it's difficult. Another approach: since the hexagon is symmetric, then the distance from W to the axis equals the distance from its mirror image to the axis. Suppose the vertical axis is the y-axis. Let me assign coordinates assuming that. Let me assume that the vertical axis is the y-axis. 

Let’s set up coordinate system: Let the vertical axis be the y-axis. Let me denote the coordinates as follows:

- Let point W be at (-a, b).
- Its mirror image would be at (a, b). Let's call this point, say, F. Because the hexagon includes point F. So maybe F is the mirror image of W. Thus, F would be at (a, b). 

Then, since Line(W,F) is given, which connects (-a,b) to (a,b), so that's a horizontal line segment. The length of WF is 14, which would be the distance between (-a,b) and (a,b): that's 2a. So 2a = 14 → a = 7. 

Now, EF is given as 10.5. Let's assume point E is the mirror image of another point. Since the hexagon is symmetric, and we have points E and F. If F is at (a,b), then E might be the mirror image of another point. For example, if E is the mirror of X, or something. 

But let's think about the hexagon structure. The hexagon is W, X, Y, Z, E, F. If W is at (-a, b), then moving along the hexagon: W to X to Y to Z to E to F to W. 

If the hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, then the points X and Y would be mirrored to other points. Wait, for example, if X is at (-c, d), then its mirror would be at (c, d), which could be another point. But the hexagon's points are W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So perhaps Z is the mirror of X, or something. 

But let's focus on the line EF. Since E is a vertex, and F is already at (a,b). Let me assume that E is the mirror of another point. If F is at (a,b), then E could be at (something). Let me think: if the vertical axis is the y-axis, then E would be mirrored to another point. For example, if E is on the right side, then its mirror is on the left. 

Alternatively, since we have EF as a side of the hexagon, and we know its length is 10.5. Assuming that E is at (some x-coordinate, y-coordinate), and F is at (a,b). Let me attempt to model this. 

Earlier, we found that a = 7 (since WF is 14, so 2a=14). So a=7, so F is at (7, b). Now, point E is connected to F via line EF, which has length 10.5. Let me assume that E is located such that the line EF is horizontal or vertical? If the hexagon is symmetric, perhaps EF is horizontal. 

If EF is horizontal, then since F is at (7, b), then E would be at (7 - 10.5, b) = (7 - 10.5, b) = (-3.5, b). Wait, but that would make EF horizontal, length 10.5. But then, if E is at (-3.5, b), then its mirror image would be at (3.5 + ... ?). Wait, the mirror image of E would be (x', y) where x' is such that the midpoint of E and its mirror is on the y-axis. 

For example, if E is at (-3.5, b), then its mirror image would be at (3.5, b). But the hexagon includes point F at (7, b). So unless there's another point. 

But the hexagon has points W(-7, b), X, Y, Z, E, F(7, b). If E is at (-3.5, b), then its mirror image is at (3.5, b). But none of the other points are mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe EF is vertical? If EF is vertical, then since F is at (7, b), E would be directly above or below. But the length is 10.5. However, this may not align with the symmetry. 

But earlier assumption was that EF is horizontal. Let me proceed with that. So EF is horizontal, from E(-3.5, b) to F(7, b), which gives a length of 7 - (-3.5) = 10.5, which matches. So yes! This works. 

Therefore, E is at (-3.5, b) and F is at (7, b). Now, since the hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, the point E(-3.5, b) would have a mirror image at (3.5, b). But the hexagon's vertices are W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So where is this mirror image? It might be one of the other points. 

For example, if the mirror image of E is another vertex. Let's say that point Z is at (3.5, b). Then Z would be the mirror of E. So the hexagon's points would be:

W(-7, b), X, Y, Z(3.5, b), E(-3.5, b), F(7, b).

Connecting these in order: W to X to Y to Z to E to F to W. 

Now, what about points X and Y? They need to be arranged such that the hexagon remains symmetric. Since we have symmetry about the y-axis, the points X and Y should be mirrored. For instance, if X is at (-c, d), then there should be a point at (c, d). But the existing points are W(-7, b), X, Y, Z(3.5, b), E(-3.5, b), F(7, b). So perhaps X and Y are mirrored points. 

Let me try to imagine the hexagon. Starting at W(-7, b), going to X. Then X to Y, Y to Z(3.5, b), Z to E(-3.5, b), E to F(7, b), and F back to W. 

To maintain symmetry, the path from W(-7, b) to X should be mirrored to the path from F(7, b) to some point. But since F is connected to E(-3.5, b), which is on the left, maybe X is mirrored to another point. 

Alternatively, since the hexagon is symmetric, the side WX should have a mirror counterpart. For example, if WX is from W(-7, b) to X(-c, d), then the mirror image would be from F(7, b) to a point at (c, d). But since the hexagon's vertices are W, X, Y, Z, E, F, perhaps the mirror of X is Y? Or another point. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still challenging. However, our main goal is to find x. Wait, the question asks to find x, but where is x defined? The answer choices are numerical, so x is likely referring to a length. 

Looking back, the problem didn't explicitly define x, but the answer choices are numbers, so x is likely a length. Perhaps x is the length of WX, which is one of the sides of the hexagon. 

Given that, let's try to calculate WX. From earlier, we have W(-7, b) and F(7, b). But what about X? Let me think. 

If we assume that the hexagon is symmetric, then the side WX is mirrored to a side on the other side. For instance, if we go from W(-7, b) to X, then the mirror image would be from F(7, b) to a point. But since the hexagon includes E(-3.5, b), maybe X is at (-c, d) and its mirror is at (c, d). 

Alternatively, since we have points E(-3.5, b) and Z(3.5, b), which are symmetric. So perhaps the side YZ is between Y and Z(3.5, b), and the mirror of Y is another point. 

But maybe there's another way. Earlier, we determined that a = 7 because the distance from W(-7, b) to F(7, b) is 14. Also, the length of EF is 10.5, which we used to find E at (-3.5, b). 

Now, if the hexagon is symmetric, then the line WX should be mirrored. Let me think about the coordinates. Suppose that point X is at (-d, e). Then its mirror image would be at (d, e). Which point is that? Maybe point Y or another. 

But since the hexagon is made of W, X, Y, Z, E, F, and we have Z at (3.5, b), E at (-3.5, b), maybe the points X and Y are arranged symmetrically around the y-axis. 

For example, if X is at (-k, m) and Y is at (k, m), then the side XY would be horizontal, and the side YZ would connect (k, m) to Z(3.5, b). Similarly, the side ZE connects Z(3.5, b) to E(-3.5, b). 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still abstract. However, maybe we can find the length of WX. 

Assume that point X is at (-d, e). Then the line WX connects (-7, b) to (-d, e). The length of WX would depend on d and e. But how do we find that? 

Wait, but since the hexagon is symmetric, the movement from W to X should be mirrored to the movement from F to some point. For instance, if we move from W(-7, b) to X(-d, e), then from F(7, b) to a point that is the mirror of X. 

But without knowing the exact path, it's hard. However, if we consider that the entire hexagon is symmetric, then the side WX must be mirrored by another side. For example, if there's a side from F to another point that mirrors WX. 

Alternatively, since we have the points W, X, Y, Z, E, F, and we've already placed W, E, F, and Z, maybe we can find relations between the remaining points. 

But perhaps there's another approach. Since we have triangle WEF with sides WF=14 and EF=10.5, and if we can find the angle between them, we might find other lengths. However, without more information, this is tough. 

Wait, but if the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, then the line WX and the line EF might be related. For example, if WX is horizontal, then EF is horizontal as well. Wait, earlier we assumed EF is horizontal. If that's the case, then WX might also be horizontal. But if WX is horizontal, then the line WX would be parallel to EF. 

Wait, but if WX is horizontal, then the length of WX would be the horizontal distance between W and X. If W is at (-7, b), and X is at (-7 + c, b), then the length WX is c. But how do we find c? 

Alternatively, if WX is horizontal, then the hexagon would have WX and EF both horizontal, aligned with the axis. But how does that help? 

Wait, but we have the symmetry. If the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, then the horizontal sides WX and EF must be symmetric. But EF is length 10.5, so maybe WX is also 10.5? But that's speculation. 

However, the answer choices include 10.5 (option C), which is the length of EF. But the question asks to find x. If x is the length of WX, then maybe it's 10.5. But why? 

Alternatively, maybe the length of WX is half of WF? Since WF is 14, half of that is 7, which is option B. 

Wait, but why would that be? If there's a right triangle involved. For example, if the hexagon has a right angle at W, forming a right triangle with legs WX and WF. But that's not necessarily true. 

Wait, earlier we had the coordinates of W(-7, b), F(7, b), and E(-3.5, b). If we consider the line from W(-7, b) to E(-3.5, b), that's a horizontal line, length 3.5. But that's not directly helpful. 

Wait, but if we consider triangle WEF, where W(-7, b), E(-3.5, b), F(7, b). Wait, that's three points on a straight line? No, because E(-3.5, b) and F(7, b) are on the same horizontal line as W(-7, b)? No, W is at (-7, b), E is at (-3.5, b), F at (7, b). So all three points are on the horizontal line y=b. So the three points are colinear, which means that the hexagon has a straight line from W to E to F. But that would make the hexagon degenerate, which is impossible. So my previous assumption must be wrong. 

Ah, here's the mistake! If E is at (-3.5, b) and F is at (7, b), then the line EF is from (-3.5, b) to (7, b), which is indeed length 10.5. But then the line from W(-7, b) to E(-3.5, b) is also horizontal, length 3.5, and the line from E(-3.5, b) to F(7, b) is 10.5. But then the hexagon would have consecutive points W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So if W is connected to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to E, E to F, and F to W. 

But if W, E, and F are colinear, then the hexagon would have overlapping sides or self-intersections. That suggests that my initial assumption about placing E and F horizontally is incorrect. 

Hmm, this indicates a flaw in my earlier reasoning. Let me backtrack. 

Maybe EF is not horizontal. Let me try a different approach. 

Since the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, then the vertical axis must pass through the midpoints of certain sides or vertices. For instance, it might pass through the midpoint of EF and the midpoint of WX. 

Let me denote the vertical axis as line l. Let me assume that line l is the perpendicular bisector of both EF and WX. 

Thus, the midpoint of EF lies on l, and the midpoint of WX also lies on l. 

Let me denote the midpoint of EF as M and the midpoint of WX as N. Both M and N are on line l. 

Since the hexagon is symmetric, the entire structure is mirrored over l. 

Now, we know the length of EF is 10.5, so EM = MF = 10.5 / 2 = 5.25. 

Similarly, if WX has length x, then the midpoint N divides it into two parts of length x/2. 

But how does this help? Well, if we can relate these midpoints somehow. 

Additionally, the line WF connects W to F. We know its length is 14. 

Let me try to express WF in terms of other segments. 

Assuming that the vertical axis passes through the midpoints of EF and WX. So, if I can find the coordinates of these points. 

Let me place the vertical axis as the y-axis. Assume that the midpoint of EF is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since EF is length 10.5, and midpoint at (0,0), then E is at (-5.25, 0) and F is at (5.25, 0). 

Now, the midpoint of WX must also lie on the y-axis. Let me denote the midpoint of WX as N, which is on the y-axis. Let me assume that W is at (-a, b) and X is at (a, b), so that their midpoint is (0, b). Wait, but then the midpoint N is (0, b). 

But then, the line WX connects (-a, b) to (a, b), which is horizontal, length 2a. 

Now, the line WF connects W(-a, b) to F(5.25, 0). The length of WF is 14. 

Using the distance formula, the distance between (-a, b) and (5.25, 0) is sqrt[(5.25 + a)^2 + (0 - b)^2] = sqrt[(5.25 + a)^2 + b²] = 14. 

So, (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

But we have too many variables here. However, since the hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, other points must also satisfy this. 

For instance, the point X(a, b) is connected to Y, which should be symmetric to some other point. Let me think about the rest of the hexagon. 

The hexagon has vertices W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So starting from W(-a, b), going to X(a, b), then to Y, then to Z, then to E(-5.25, 0), then to F(5.25, 0), then back to W. 

To maintain symmetry, the points Y and Z should be placed symmetrically. Let's say Y is at (c, d) and Z is at (-c, d), ensuring symmetry. 

But this is getting complex. However, the key equation we have is (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

But we need another equation to solve for a and b. Perhaps using the position of point Z or Y? 

Alternatively, since the hexagon is closed, the connections between the points must form a continuous loop. 

From X(a, b) to Y(c, d), then to Z(-c, d), then to E(-5.25, 0). 

But without more information, it's challenging. However, maybe there's another condition. 

Wait, since the hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, the side YZ must be symmetric. For example, if Y is at (c, d), then Z is at (-c, d). So the line YZ would be horizontal, from (c, d) to (-c, d), length 2c. 

Then, from Z(-c, d) to E(-5.25, 0). This would require that the line from Z(-c, d) to E(-5.25, 0) is part of the hexagon. 

But this still leaves many variables. However, maybe we can find a relationship between a and c. 

Alternatively, consider that the entire hexagon is symmetric, so the side from Z to E should be mirrored to another side. For example, if Z is at (-c, d), then its mirror is at (c, d), which might be point Y. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me return to the earlier equation: (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

If I can find another equation involving a and b, I can solve for them. 

Perhaps the line from Z to E is part of the hexagon. Let me assume that Z is at (-c, d), connected to E(-5.25, 0). The length of ZE would depend on c and d. 

But without knowing Z's position, it's hard. 

Wait, but what if the line from Z to E is symmetric to another line? For example, if Z is at (-c, d), then its mirror is at (c, d), which might be point Y. 

But I'm not making progress. Let me think differently. 

We have two equations: 

1. Length of EF is 10.5, which we've placed as E(-5.25, 0) and F(5.25, 0). 
2. Length of WF is 14, from W(-a, b) to F(5.25, 0). 

But we need to relate this to the rest of the hexagon. Perhaps the line WX is part of the hexagon, and its length is x. 

Assuming that WX has length 2a, as previously stated. 

But how to find a? 

Wait, maybe the line from X(a, b) to Y(c, d) and from Y(c, d) to Z(-c, d) forms a symmetric part. 

If I assume that the hexagon is convex and symmetric, then the points Y and Z would be placed such that the connections make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line from X(a, b) to Y(c, d) is vertical? Not sure. 

This seems too vague. Let me think about the possibility that the answer is 7, which is option B. 

Because 14 divided by 2 is 7. Maybe the length of WX is half of WF? Why? 

If the hexagon is symmetric, maybe the distance from W to the axis is 7, making the total length of WF 14. For example, if W is at (-7, 0), and F is at (7, 0), making WF = 14. Then, the midpoint of WF is at (0,0), which is the vertical axis. 

But then, EF is 10.5. If E is at (-3.5, 0), and F at (7, 0), then EF would be from -3.5 to 7, which is 10.5. But then, E is at (-3.5, 0), and F at (7, 0), making EF = 10.5. 

In this scenario, the vertical axis is the y-axis, passing through the midpoint of WF (0,0) and the midpoint of EF (which is ((-3.5 + 7)/2, 0) = (1.75, 0), which is not on the y-axis. This contradicts the symmetry requirement. 

Ah, so this setup violates the symmetry. Hence, this approach is flawed. 

Wait, but if the vertical axis is the y-axis, then the midpoint of EF must lie on the y-axis. So, if E is at (-d, 0) and F is at (d, 0), then the midpoint is (0,0), and EF length is 2d = 10.5 → d = 5.25. So E is at (-5.25, 0), F at (5.25, 0). 

Now, WF is from W to F(5.25, 0). Let's say W is at (-a, b). The distance between W(-a, b) and F(5.25, 0) is 14. 

So, sqrt((5.25 + a)^2 + (b)^2) = 14 → (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

But what else? The hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, so the other points must be placed symmetrically. 

Assume that the hexagon has vertices W, X, Y, Z, E, F. With E at (-5.25, 0) and F at (5.25, 0). 

Let me assume that W is at (-a, b), and its symmetric counterpart is a point on the right. Since the hexagon is symmetric, the point opposite to W would be at (a, b). But this point is not necessarily one of the vertices. 

However, the hexagon's vertices are W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So, if W is at (-a, b), then its mirror is at (a, b), which might be one of the other points. 

For example, if X is at (a, b), then the line WX would be from (-a, b) to (a, b), which is horizontal, length 2a. 

But then, the line from X(a, b) to Y would need to continue the hexagon. Let's say Y is at (c, d), then Z is at (-c, d) due to symmetry. 

Then, from Z(-c, d) to E(-5.25, 0), and from E to F(5.25, 0). 

Now, we need to ensure that all these points form a closed hexagon. 

But without more constraints, it's still underdetermined. However, maybe we can find a relationship between a and c. 

Consider the connection from Z(-c, d) to E(-5.25, 0). This line would have some slope, and similarly, the connection from X(a, b) to Y(c, d) would have a slope. 

But this is too vague. Let me try to use the distance from W to F. 

We have (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

If we can find another equation relating a and b, we can solve for them. 

What if the line from X(a, b) to Y(c, d) is such that the hexagon closes properly? For example, the line from Y(c, d) to Z(-c, d) is horizontal, and then from Z(-c, d) to E(-5.25, 0). 

But again, this requires assumptions. 

Alternatively, maybe the point Z is at (-5.25, 0), which is E. But no, E is already at (-5.25, 0). 

This is getting too tangled. Let me think if there's a simpler way. 

Since the answer choices include 3.5, 7, 10.5, and 21, and given that 10.5 is the length of EF, and 14 is the length of WF, perhaps x is the length of WX, which could be 7. 

Why 7? Because 14 is twice 7, and if the hexagon is symmetric, maybe the length of WX is half of WF. But why? 

Alternatively, if the triangle formed by W, E, and F is a right triangle, then using Pythagoras: 

If WF = 14, EF = 10.5, then the third side would be sqrt(14² - 10.5²) = sqrt(196 - 110.25) = sqrt(85.75) ≈ 9.26, which is not an option. 

But if the triangle is not right, maybe there's another relationship. 

Wait, if the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis, and WF is 14, and EF is 10.5, then perhaps the length of WX is 7. 

Because if we assume that the line from W to the vertical axis is 7, making the total length from W to F 14. For example, if W is at (-7, 0), and the vertical axis is at x=0, then F is at (7, 0), making WF = 14. Then, EF is 10.5, so E is at (-3.5, 0), making EF from -3.5 to 7, which is 10.5. 

But in this case, the vertical axis is the y-axis, passing through the midpoint of WF (0,0) and the midpoint of EF is at ( ( -3.5 + 7 ) / 2, 0 ) = (1.75, 0), which is not on the y-axis. This violates the symmetry requirement, as the midpoint of EF should be on the vertical axis. 

Hence, this setup is invalid. 

But if EF is symmetric about the vertical axis, then its midpoint must be on the vertical axis. So, if E and F are symmetric about the axis, then E and F are reflections of each other. For example, if the vertical axis is the y-axis, then E is at (-d, 0) and F at (d, 0), making EF length 2d = 10.5 → d = 5.25. 

Then, the distance from W to F is 14. Let's say W is at (-a, b), and F is at (5.25, 0). Then, the distance between W and F is sqrt((5.25 + a)^2 + (0 - b)^2) = 14. 

Now, if the hexagon is symmetric about the y-axis, then W must have a mirror image. If W is at (-a, b), its mirror is at (a, b). This point should be one of the hexagon's vertices. 

Let's assume that this mirror point is X. So X is at (a, b). Thus, the line WX is from (-a, b) to (a, b), length 2a. 

Now, the length of WX is 2a. If we can find a, we can find x = 2a. 

But how? 

We have the equation from WF: (5.25 + a)^2 + b² = 196. 

But we need another equation. Let's consider the line from X(a, b) to Y. Since the hexagon is symmetric, the point Y should be the mirror of another point. 

Assume that the next vertex after X is Y, which is at (c, d), and its mirror is at (-c, d). 

Then, from Y(c, d) to Z(-c, d), then to E(-5.25, 0). 

But this is still too vague. However, if we assume that the line from Z to E is symmetric to another line, perhaps the line from X to Y. 

Alternatively, maybe the line from Z to E is vertical? If Z is at (-5.25, 0), then E is at (-5.25, 0), which is the same point, which is not possible. 

This suggests that I'm missing a key insight. 

Let me recall that the hexagon is symmetric about the vertical axis. This means that for every point P on the hexagon, its mirror image P' is also on the hexagon. 

Given that, the vertices are W, X, Y, Z, E, F. So, each vertex has a mirror image. 

Let's list the vertices:

- W has a mirror image, say, F.
- X has a mirror image, say, Y.
- Y has a mirror image, say, X.
- Z has a mirror image, say, E.
- E has a mirror image, say, Z.
- F has a mirror image, say, W.

This would make the hexagon symmetric. 

So, for example, if W is at (-a, b), its mirror is F at (a, b). Similarly, X at (-c, d) has mirror Y at (c, d). Z at (-e, f) has mirror E at (e, f). 

Now, let's apply this. 

Given that, the points are:

- W(-a, b)
- X(-c, d)
- Y(c, d)
- Z(-e, f)
- E(e, f)
- F(a, b)

Now, the hexagon is W -> X -> Y -> Z -> E -> F -> W. 

Let's analyze the connections:

1. W to X: from (-a, b) to (-c, d)
2. X to Y: from (-c, d) to (c, d)
3. Y to Z: from (c, d) to (-e, f)
4. Z to E: from (-e, f) to (e, f)
5. E to F: from (e, f) to (a, b)
6. F to W: from (a, b) to (-a, b)

Now, let's use the given lengths:

- Length of EF is 10.5. EF is from E(e, f) to F(a, b). So the distance between (e, f) and (a, b) is 10.5.

- Length of WF is 14. WF is from W(-a, b) to F(a, b), which is a horizontal line, length 2a = 14 → a = 7.

So, a = 7. Hence, F is at (7, b), and W is at (-7, b). 

Now, we need to find the length of EF, which is from E(e, f) to F(7, b), and this length is 10.5. 

Also, the point E(e, f) is the mirror of Z(-e, f). So, Z is at (-e, f), and E is at (e, f). 

Now, let's look at the connection from Z(-e, f) to E(e, f). This is a horizontal line from (-e, f) to (e, f), length 2e. 

But we don't know e yet. 

Also, the line from Y(c, d) to Z(-e, f) needs to be considered. 

But let's focus on EF. The distance between E(e, f) and F(7, b) is 10.5. 

So, sqrt[(7 - e)^2 + (b - f)^2] = 10.5. 

But we have too many variables here: e, f, b, c, d. 

However, we can use the symmetry to find relationships. 

For example, the line from Y(c, d) to Z(-e, f) must connect to Z(-e, f). Let's assume that this line is part of the hexagon. 

But without more info, it's still difficult. 

However, we know that the line from X(-c, d) to Y(c, d)
