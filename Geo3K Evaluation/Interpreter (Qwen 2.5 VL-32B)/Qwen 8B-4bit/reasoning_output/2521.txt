MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an equilateral triangle RST. Wait, hold on—if it's an equilateral triangle, all sides should be equal, right? But the problem gives different expressions for each side: RS is x + 9, ST is 2x, and RT is 3x - 9. Hmm, that seems contradictory because in an equilateral triangle, all sides are the same length. So maybe I need to set these expressions equal to each other and solve for x?

Let me start by writing down the equations. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, RS = ST = RT. Therefore:

RS = x + 9
ST = 2x
RT = 3x - 9

So setting them equal:

First, set RS equal to ST: x + 9 = 2x. Solving that would give 9 = x. Let me check if that works with the third side. If x is 9, then RT would be 3*9 - 9 = 27 - 9 = 18. But RS would be 9 + 9 = 18. So RS and RT would both be 18, but ST would be 2*9=18. Oh wait, so all three sides would be equal! That works. So x=9?

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option C is 9. But let me double-check my steps. Maybe there's another way to approach it? For example, maybe I made a mistake in assuming all sides are equal. Wait, the problem says it's an equilateral triangle, so all sides must be equal. So yes, setting all three expressions equal to each other should work.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's a possibility that two sides are equal and the third is different, but that would contradict the definition of an equilateral triangle. So the only way all sides are equal is if all three expressions are equal. Therefore, solving x+9=2x gives x=9. Then substituting back into RT: 3x-9 = 3*9 -9= 18. Which equals RS and ST. So x=9. So the answer should be C.

But let me make sure there isn't another equation here. For instance, sometimes problems may involve other constraints, like perimeter or area, but in this case, the problem only mentions the lengths of the sides. So since it's equilateral, all sides must be equal. Hence, solving x+9=2x and also 2x=3x-9. Wait, maybe I should check both pairs. 

First equation: x + 9 = 2x → x = 9. Second equation: 2x = 3x -9 → subtract 2x from both sides: 0 = x -9 → x=9. So both equations lead to x=9. Therefore, x=9 is the solution. So answer C. 

Looking at the options, C is 9. So the correct answer is C.
