MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 3, given that AB is perpendicular to BC. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, I need to parse all the given information. There are several points mentioned: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,C), Line(D,A), Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,B). Also, some angles are defined: Angle(D,A,B), Angle(B,A,C), Angle(E,F,C), Angle(B,A,G), Angle(A,B,G), Angle(G,B,A). Additionally, there are measures given for three angles: MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B), 36), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C), 24), MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,C), 40). Then there's RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) and Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)). Also, Triangle(A,B,G) is mentioned.

Wait, the main thing here is that AB is perpendicular to BC. But according to the given predicates, there's already a RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which would mean that angle at point B between points A and C is a right angle. Wait, but angle ABC? Because Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between A and C. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, that makes sense because that angle would be 90 degrees. However, the problem says that AB ⊥ BC, so angle ABC is a right angle. 

But wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's also MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C), 24). Wait, Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A between points B and C. Wait, that's different from angle ABC. Let me clarify:

In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So:

- Angle(D,A,B): angle at A between D and B.
- Angle(B,A,C): angle at A between B and C.
- Angle(E,F,C): angle at F between E and C.
- Angle(B,A,G): angle at A between B and G.
- Angle(A,B,G): angle at B between A and G.
- Angle(G,B,A): angle at B between G and A.

Also, the RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): this is angle at B between A and C, which is angle ABC. So angle ABC is 90 degrees. But wait, earlier we have MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C), 24). That's angle at A between B and C, which is angle BAC. So angle BAC is 24 degrees. And since angle ABC is 90 degrees, then in triangle ABC, we can find angle ACB.

In triangle ABC, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. So angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180. We know angle BAC is 24°, angle ABC is 90°, so angle ACB = 180 - 24 - 90 = 66 degrees. So angle at C, angle ACB is 66 degrees.

Now, there's another angle given: MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B), 36). That's angle at A between D and B. So angle DAB is 36 degrees. Since point D is connected to A via Line(D,A), so D is somewhere such that AD is a line. Then angle DAB is part of angle BAC? Or maybe not. Wait, angle DAB is at point A between D and B. Since angle BAC is 24 degrees, and angle DAB is 36 degrees. Hmm, how do these relate?

Let me visualize. Point A has two lines: one going to B, and another to C. Also, there's a line from D to A. So angle DAB is formed by DA and BA. If angle DAB is 36 degrees, and angle BAC is 24 degrees, then perhaps DA is extending beyond BA? Or maybe DA is forming another angle with BA. Depending on where D is located. For example, if D is on the same side as C relative to AB, then angle DAB could be adjacent to angle BAC. But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe DA is forming a straight line with something else, creating supplementary angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle DAB is involved. But we don't have much info about D except that it's connected to A. Similarly, other points like E, F, G are involved with other lines and angles.

Then there's Angle(E,F,C) measured at F between E and C, which is 40 degrees. Also, there's a line FG connected to G, and GB connected to B. Also, Triangle(A,B,G) is present, meaning points A, B, G form a triangle. Also, Angle(B,A,G) and Angle(A,B,G) are mentioned. Let me check those.

Angle(B,A,G) is the angle at A between B and G. Angle(A,B,G) is the angle at B between A and G. So in triangle ABG, we have angles at A, B, and G. But we need more information about these angles.

But the question is about angle 3. Wait, the original problem mentions angle 3, but the given predicates don't explicitly label angles as 1, 2, 3. Wait, maybe angle 3 refers to one of the angles mentioned in the predicates? Let me check again.

Looking back, the question says "Find the measure of ∠3 if AB ⊥ BC." Wait, but the original problem may refer to angle 3 as one of the angles in the diagram, possibly involving points A, B, G? Since there's a triangle ABG mentioned. Maybe angle at G, or another angle?

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to angle at G, or angle at A, or angle at B. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. However, given the answer choices and the given data, perhaps angle 3 refers to angle at G in triangle ABG?

Alternatively, considering the given angles, maybe angle 3 is referring to angle at B between A and G, which is Angle(A,B,G), or angle at A between B and G, Angle(B,A,G)?

Wait, the problem statement might have had a specific labeling of angles as 1, 2, 3, but since the user hasn't included a diagram, I need to infer based on the given predicates.

Wait, the answer options are A. 64, B. 68, C. 72, D. 76. These numbers are close to 66, which was angle ACB earlier. Maybe angle 3 relates to angle at C, but that was 66, which isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe angle at G?

Wait, there's a triangle ABG. In triangle ABG, we have angles at A, B, and G. Let's see if we can find those angles.

We know that there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle ABC being 90 degrees. But angle at B in triangle ABG is Angle(A,B,G), which is the angle at B between A and G. How does that relate to angle ABC?

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and point G is connected to B via Line(G,B), which is part of the line BG. So point G is connected to B. Also, there's Line(F,G) and Line(E,F), making a triangle EFG with angle at F being 40 degrees. Not sure yet.

Let me focus on triangle ABG. To find its angles, we need more information. We know that AB is perpendicular to BC, so AB is vertical if BC is horizontal, but without coordinates, it's abstract.

But perhaps angle at B in triangle ABG is part of angle ABC. Since angle ABC is 90 degrees, and if BG is a line from B to G, then angle between AB and BG (which is angle A,B,G) plus angle between BG and BC would sum to 90 degrees. However, unless we know more about where G is located.

Wait, there's also Angle(B,A,G) which is the angle at A between B and G. So in triangle ABG, angle at A is Angle(B,A,G). Let me think. Suppose we can find angles in triangle ABG.

But how? We need more relations. Perhaps there are other angles given. For instance, Angle(G,B,A) is mentioned, which is the same as Angle(B,A,G)? No, wait. Angle(G,B,A) is the angle at B between G and A, which is the same as Angle(A,B,G). So Angle(G,B,A) is the same as Angle(A,B,G).

So, in triangle ABG, angles are:

At A: Angle(B,A,G) ?

At B: Angle(A,B,G)

At G: ?

But we need to find these angles. However, without more info, it's tricky. Unless there are other relationships.

Wait, there's also Angle(D,A,B) which is 36 degrees. That's angle at A between D and B. If DA is a line from D to A, and angle between DA and AB is 36 degrees. Since angle between AB and AC is 24 degrees (Angle(B,A,C)), then if DA forms an angle of 36 degrees with AB, then depending on direction, DA could be on the opposite side of AB compared to AC.

For example, suppose AB is a horizontal line, and AC goes up at 24 degrees above AB. Then DA could be going down at 36 degrees below AB, making angle DAB = 36 degrees. Then, the total angle around point A would be angle between DA and AC, which would be 36 + 24 = 60 degrees? Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe DA is part of a triangle or another structure. Without knowing the diagram, it's challenging, but perhaps we can use the fact that there's a triangle ABG, and maybe some relations between angles.

Another thought: since AB is perpendicular to BC, and there's a right angle at B, maybe triangle ABG involves some right angles or other known angles.

Wait, in triangle ABG, if we can find two angles, then we can find the third. Let's assume that angle at B (Angle(A,B,G)) is x, angle at A (Angle(B,A,G)) is y, and angle at G is z. Then x + y + z = 180.

But how to find x and y?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between angle at A (y) and the given angle DAB = 36 degrees. If DA is connected to point D, and angle DAB is 36 degrees, then perhaps DA is a line that creates some relationship with AG.

Wait, but without knowing where D is, it's unclear. However, maybe angle DAB is part of another triangle or configuration. For instance, if D is connected to C, but not stated. Alternatively, maybe triangle DAB has some properties.

Alternatively, since angle BAC is 24 degrees, and angle DAB is 36 degrees, then if points D, A, and C are arranged in a way that angle DAC is 36 - 24 = 12 degrees? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe DA and AC form some relation. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, the answer choices suggest that angle 3 is likely 64, 68, 72, or 76. Given that angle ACB was found to be 66 degrees, which is close to 64 or 68. Maybe angle 3 is related to that.

Wait, maybe angle 3 refers to angle at C, which was 66 degrees. But none of the answer choices match that. Alternatively, maybe angle at G in triangle ABG?

Alternatively, consider triangle ABG. Let's think about the angles. If we can find angle at B (Angle(A,B,G)), and angle at A (Angle(B,A,G)), then we can find the third angle.

But how? Let me think. Is there any information about triangle ABG?

Given that Triangle(A,B,G) exists, and there's Angle(B,A,G) and Angle(A,B,G). Also, there's a mention of Angle(G,B,A), which is the same as Angle(A,B,G). 

Additionally, there's a Line(G,B), which connects G to B. Also, Line(F,G) and Line(E,F) make a triangle EFG with angle at F being 40 degrees. But how does that connect to other parts?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles involving point G. For instance, if angle at B (Angle(A,B,G)) is part of the right angle at B. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and if BG is a line from B to G, then angle between AB and BG (Angle(A,B,G)) plus angle between BG and BC would be 90 degrees. But unless we know something about BG, we can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe angle at B in triangle ABG is complementary to some angle. For example, if BG is aligned such that angle between BG and BC is something, but again, not enough info.

Alternatively, look for other angles. The given angle at F is 40 degrees, which is part of triangle EFG. But how does that tie in?

This seems complicated. Let me recap:

Known angles:

- Angle at A (BAC) = 24°
- Angle at B (ABC) = 90°
- Angle at C (ACB) = 66°
- Angle DAB = 36°
- Angle EFC = 40°

Other angles:

- Angle(B,A,G) and Angle(A,B,G) in triangle ABG
- Other angles involving points D, E, F, G

Perhaps there's a way to use the given angles to find relations in triangle ABG.

Assuming that angle at A in triangle ABG is related to angle DAB. If DA is a line from D to A, making angle DAB = 36°, and assuming that AG is another line from A to G, then maybe angle between DA and AG is something. But without knowing the position of G, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe angle DAB is part of a larger triangle or quadrilateral involving G.

Wait, the answer choices are 64, 68, 72, 76. These numbers are close to 66, which was angle ACB. Maybe angle 3 is angle ACB minus something or plus something?

Alternatively, if angle at C is 66°, and angle EFC is 40°, then maybe there's a way to combine these. But how?

Alternatively, think about triangle EFG. Angle at F is 40°, and if it's a right triangle, then maybe other angles are 50° and 90°, but not sure.

Alternatively, since there's a right angle at B (ABC), and maybe triangle ABG is part of that setup.

Wait, maybe angle at B in triangle ABG is supplementary to angle ABC? No, because ABC is 90°, and if BG is a line from B, then angle between AB and BG could be something else.

Wait, let me consider triangle ABG. Let's denote:

Let’s call angle at A (Angle(B,A,G)) as α, angle at B (Angle(A,B,G)) as β, and angle at G as γ. So α + β + γ = 180°.

If I can find either α or β, I can find the others.

Is there a way to find β? Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and BG is a line from B. If BG is connected to G, and there's a line from G to B, perhaps there's a right angle at B involving BG and another line?

Wait, there's a mention of Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)), which confirms that AB is perpendicular to BC. So, at point B, AB and BC are perpendicular.

Now, if BG is another line from B, then depending on where G is, it could form various angles. For example, if BG is along BC, then angle between AB and BG would be 90°, but that would make angle ABD (assuming D is along BC?) but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe BG is forming some other angle. For instance, if there's a right angle at G, but that's not stated.

Wait, there's also Angle(G,B,A) which is the same as Angle(A,B,G), which is β. If there's another angle related to G, but not sure.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABG and other angles. For example, if there's a relationship between angle at A (α) and angle DAB (36°). If DA is connected to A, and AG is connected to A, then angle between DA and AG could be related to angle DAB and angle BAG (α). For instance, if DA and AG form a linear pair, then angle DAG + angle BAG = 180°, but not sure.

Alternatively, if points D, A, G are colinear, then angle DAB would be related to angle BAG. But without knowing, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but if angle DAB is 36°, and angle BAC is 24°, and assuming that DA is on the opposite side of AB from AC, then angle between DA and AC would be 36° + 24° = 60°, but again, not helpful directly.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABG has some connection to the other angles. For example, if angle at A (α) is 36°, but why would that be?

Wait, the given angle DAB is 36°, which is angle at A between D and B. If AG is a line from A to G, then maybe angle between DA and AG is something. If AG is aligned such that it creates a certain angle with DA, but again, without knowing the diagram, it's difficult.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABG and the given angles. Suppose that angle at A (α) is angle BAG, which could be related to angle DAB. For example, if DA is extended past A to meet G, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe angle at A (α) is equal to angle DAB, which is 36°. Then, in triangle ABG, angle at A is 36°, angle at B is β, and angle at G is γ. Then, 36 + β + γ = 180. But without knowing β or γ, can't proceed.

But maybe there's a relationship between β and other angles. For example, if BG is perpendicular to something? Or if there's a right angle at G?

Wait, there's a mention of RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle ABC = 90°. Are there any other right angles? Not directly stated, but maybe inferred.

Alternatively, if angle at B in triangle ABG is related to angle ABC. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and if BG is a line from B to G, then angle between AB and BG (β) plus angle between BG and BC equals 90°. If we can find one of those angles, we can find β.

But how?

Wait, there's another angle mentioned: Angle(E,F,C) = 40°. This is the angle at F between E and C. If this is part of a right triangle, for example, if EF is perpendicular to FC, but angle at F is 40°, so that wouldn't be a right angle. Or maybe triangle EFC has some property.

But without knowing where E and F are, it's hard to link this to other parts.

This seems too vague. Let me try to think differently. Since the answer choices are around 64-76, and we had angle ACB = 66°, which is close to 64 or 68. Maybe angle 3 is related to that.

Wait, maybe angle 3 is angle ACB (66°), and the closest option is A. 64? But 66 isn't an option. Or maybe it's angle at G?

Alternatively, think about triangle ABG. Let's assume that angle at A (α) is 36°, angle at B (β) is something, and angle at G is something. If we can find β.

But how?

Wait, if we assume that BG is perpendicular to something. For example, if BG is perpendicular to AB, then β would be 90°, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, if BG is part of another right angle. Or if there's a right triangle involving G.

Alternatively, think about the given angle at F (40°). If triangle EFC is part of a larger structure, maybe involving point G or other points.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle ABG and angle at A is 24°, and angle at B is 90°, but no, angle at B in triangle ABG is not necessarily the same as angle ABC.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to focus on the critical pieces:

We have angle BAC = 24°, angle ABC = 90°, so angle ACB = 66°. Now, what about angle at C, which is 66°, and maybe angle 3 is related to this?

But answer choices don't have 66. Closest is 64 or 68. Maybe there's a calculation involving 66 and other angles.

Alternatively, consider that angle at C is 66°, and angle EFC is 40°, so 66 - 40 = 26, not helpful. Or 66 + 40 = 106, still not matching.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABG. If angle at A is 24°, angle at B is something, and angle at G is something. But why would angle at A be 24°? It could be, but that would require that AG is aligned with AC, but not sure.

Wait, angle at A in triangle ABG is Angle(B,A,G), which is the angle between BA and GA. If GA is extending from A to G, and if GA is along AC, then angle BAG would be angle BAC, which is 24°, making angle at A in triangle ABG as 24°. Then, in triangle ABG, angles would be 24° at A, and angle at B (β), and angle at G (γ). If we can find β.

But how? If AB is perpendicular to BC, and BG is a line from B to G, then angle between AB and BG (β) plus angle between BG and BC equals 90°. If we can find one of those angles.

But how? Maybe through other given angles. Like, if there's a right angle at G, or if there's a known length.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABG is a right triangle. For example, if BG is perpendicular to AB, then angle at B would be 90°, making triangle ABG a right triangle with angles 24°, 90°, and 66°, which sums to 180. But then angle at G would be 66°, which is close to the answer choices. But the answer choices are 64, 68, 72, 76. 66 isn't there, but closest is 64 or 68. If the actual value is 66, maybe due to rounding or miscalculation, the intended answer is 64 or 68. But how to decide?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my assumption. Let me recheck:

If angle at A is 24°, angle at B is 90°, then angle at G would be 66°, which is not among the choices. Hence, this suggests that my assumption about the angle at A in triangle ABG being 24° is incorrect.

Therefore, angle at A in triangle ABG must be something else.

Back to the given angle DAB = 36°. If DA is a line from D to A, and angle between DA and AB is 36°, then if AG is a line from A to G, then maybe angle between DA and AG is related. For example, if AG is a continuation of DA, then angle BAG would be 36° - 24° = 12°, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, if DA and AG form a straight line, then angle DAB (36°) and angle BAG would add up to 180°, making angle BAG = 180° - 36° = 144°, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, if DA and AC are on the same line, then angle DAB would be angle between DA and AB, and angle CAB is 24°, so if DA extends from A in the opposite direction of AC, then angle DAB would be 180° - 24° = 156°, but given that it's 36°, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach. Since the answer choices are numerical and likely involve subtraction or addition of known angles, let's think about possible combinations.

We have angle BAC = 24°, angle ABC = 90°, angle ACB = 66°. Also, angle DAB = 36°, angle EFC = 40°.

Maybe angle 3 is related to angle ACB (66°) and angle EFC (40°). For example, 66 - 40 = 26, not helpful. Or 66 + 40 = 106. Still no.

Alternatively, since angle EFC is 40°, which is part of triangle EFG, and if that triangle has a right angle, then the other angles would be 50° and 90°, but again, not directly related.

Wait, if angle EFC is 40°, and if there's a right angle at F, then angle at E or G would be 50°, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, consider that angle DAB = 36°, angle BAC = 24°, so the difference is 12°, which might be part of another angle.

Alternatively, think about triangle ABD. If DAB is 36°, and AB is known, but without lengths, it's hard.

Wait, maybe angle at A in triangle ABG is angle BAD = 36°, so angle BAG = 36°, making angle at A in triangle ABG as 36°, then in triangle ABG, angles are 36° at A, β at B, and γ at G. Sum to 180. So β + γ = 144°.

If angle at B (β) is part of the right angle at B (angle ABC = 90°). If BG is a line from B to G, then angle between AB and BG (β) plus angle between BG and BC equals 90°. If we can find one of those angles.

Suppose that angle between BG and BC is the same as angle EFC = 40°, but why would that be? Not sure.

Alternatively, if BG is parallel to EC, but no information about that.

Alternatively, if there's a transversal or something.

This is really challenging without a diagram. Let me try to think about what the answer choices suggest. The options are 64, 68, 72, 76. These are all multiples of 4, suggesting some division or multiplication.

Wait, if angle ACB is 66°, and if we subtract 2°, we get 64, which is option A. Or add 2° to get 68, option B. But why would that be?

Alternatively, consider that angle at G in triangle ABG is 66°, and if there's some relation to other angles. For example, if angle at G is 66°, then the answer is 66, but it's not listed. So maybe the actual calculation leads to 64 or 68.

Wait, let me think about triangle ABG. Assume that angle at A is 36°, angle at B is x, angle at G is y. So 36 + x + y = 180 → x + y = 144.

If angle at B (x) is related to angle ABC (90°), and if BG is a line that makes angle x with AB, then the remaining angle between BG and BC would be 90° - x. If this remaining angle is equal to angle EFC (40°), then 90° - x = 40° → x = 50°. Then angle at G would be 144 - 50 = 94°, which is not among the options. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if angle at B (x) is 40°, then angle at G would be 144 - 40 = 104°, still not matching.

Alternatively, if angle at B is 24°, then angle at G would be 144 - 24 = 120°, nope.

Alternatively, if angle at B is 64°, then angle at G would be 144 - 64 = 80°, which is not an option.

Wait, but the answer choices are 64, 68, 72, 76. If angle at G is one of these, then perhaps the calculation involves finding angle at G as 64°, for example.

But how?

Let me try another approach. Since angle at B in triangle ABC is 90°, and there's a line BG. If BG is such that it creates some known angles. For example, if BG is the altitude from B to AC, but that would create right angles, but not sure.

Alternatively, if BG is such that triangle ABG has angles that relate to the given angles. For instance, if angle at A (α) is 36°, angle at B is 90°, then angle at G would be 54°, but again, not matching.

Wait, if angle at A is 36°, and angle at B is 90°, then angle at G is 54°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if angle at A is 24°, angle at B is 90°, then angle at G is 66°, which is close to 64 or 68.

But since 66 is not an option, maybe there's an error in assumptions.

Wait, perhaps angle 3 is not in triangle ABG, but somewhere else. Let's revisit the given angles.

There's Angle(G,B,A) which is angle at B between G and A, which is part of the right angle at B. If angle at B in this case is part of the 90° angle, then maybe it's split into two angles: one being angle ABG (let's say x), and another being angle CBG (let's say y), such that x + y = 90°.

If we can find x or y, we can find angle at B.

But how? Maybe through other given angles. For example, if angle at G is related to angle EFC (40°).

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving G and F, but no direct connection.

Wait, there's a line from F to G, and line from E to F, making angle at F of 40°. If this triangle EFG is related to other parts, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if angle at F (40°) is part of a triangle with angle at G, but again, no direct link.

This is very frustrating without a diagram. Maybe I should try to assume that angle 3 is angle at G in triangle ABG, and try to calculate it using available info.

Assume that in triangle ABG, angle at A is 36°, angle at B is x, angle at G is y. So 36 + x + y = 180 → x + y = 144.

If x is part of the right angle at B, then x + z = 90°, where z is the other part. If z is equal to angle EFC (40°), then x = 50°, so y = 144 - 50 = 94°, not matching.

Alternatively, if z is 24°, then x = 66°, y = 78°, not matching.

Alternatively, if x is 24°, then y = 120°, nope.

Alternatively, if x is 40°, then y = 104°, nope.

Alternatively, if x is 36°, then y = 108°, nope.

None of these match the options. Maybe my assumption about angle at A being 36° is wrong.

Let me try assuming that angle at A in triangle ABG is 24°, making angle at B (x) and angle at G (y) such that x + y = 156°. If x is 90°, then y = 66°, which is close to 64 or 68. If the actual value is 66°, and the closest option is 64 (option A) or 68 (option B). But why would it be 64 or 68?

Alternatively, if there's a calculation error, like 66 - 2 = 64, or 66 + 2 = 68. But why subtract or add 2?

Alternatively, if there's another angle involved. For example, if angle at G is 66°, and there's another angle that reduces it by 2°, giving 64, or increases by 2°, giving 68.

But without concrete reasoning, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, think about the given angle DAB = 36°, angle BAC = 24°, so the angle between DA and AC is 36° - 24° = 12°, which might be part of another triangle.

If there's a triangle with 12°, and angle EFC = 40°, then 12 + 40 = 52°, not helpful.

Alternatively, 36° + 24° = 60°, which is not in options.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess. Since angle ACB is 66°, and the closest answer is 64 (option A) or 68 (option B). Given that 66 is closer to 64 than 68, I might lean towards A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, but the question says "if AB ⊥ BC", which is already given as part of the predicates (RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C))). So maybe there's a specific calculation involving that.

Wait, let me recall that in triangle ABC, angle at C is 66°, and if there's a line from C to G, but no info. Or if there's a line from G to C, but not specified.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is angle ACB (66°), and the closest option is A (64) or B (68). Since 66 is not an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate angle ACB. In triangle ABC, angle BAC = 24°, angle ABC = 90°, so angle ACB = 180 - 24 - 90 = 66°, correct.

If angle 3 is angle ACB, then the answer isn't there, but maybe it's angle at G in some other triangle. For example, if there's a triangle with angle at G being 66°, but again, not matching.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where 24° and 40° are used, 24 + 40 = 64°, which is option A. So maybe angle 3 is 64°, hence answer A.

Yes, this makes sense! If angle 3 is the sum of angle BAC (24°) and angle EFC (40°), giving 64°, which is option A.

That seems plausible. So the answer is A.
