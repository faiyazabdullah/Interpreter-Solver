====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points O, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. But maybe not all are directly involved here. The angles mentioned are BOF, DOA, AOE, DOE. Their measures are given in terms of variables x and y. Also, there's a sum of these four angles equals 360 degrees. The question is to find x.

So, first, let's note down the measure expressions:

MeasureOf(Angle(BOF)) = 7x + 9  
MeasureOf(Angle(DOA)) = 7y - 4  
MeasureOf(Angle(AOE)) = 11x - 1  
MeasureOf(Angle(DOE)) = 2y + 5  

And the sum of these four angles is 360 degrees. So:

(7x + 9) + (7y - 4) + (11x - 1) + (2y + 5) = 360

Let me combine like terms here. Let's compute the coefficients for x and y, and constants separately.

For x terms: 7x + 11x = 18x  
For y terms: 7y + 2y = 9y  
Constants: 9 - 4 -1 +5. Let's calculate that: 9 -4 is 5, minus 1 is 4, plus 5 is 9. So total constant term is 9.

Therefore, equation becomes: 18x + 9y + 9 = 360

Wait, but that seems like we have two variables here, x and y. However, the problem asks for x, so maybe there's another relationship between x and y? Or perhaps some geometric constraints that link them?

But wait, the problem mentions angles BOF, DOA, AOE, and DOE. Maybe these angles are part of a larger figure where certain angle relations hold. For example, if points are arranged around point O, maybe these angles form a full circle around point O, hence adding up to 360 degrees. That would make sense because the sum is given as 360.

But let's think about the arrangement. Suppose all these angles are at point O. Then, the sum of angles around a point is indeed 360 degrees. Therefore, the given sum makes sense. But then why are there two variables, x and y? Because different angles may involve different variables. 

However, without more information, we need another equation to solve for x and y. Wait, but the problem only gives us one equation here. Unless there are other relationships implied by the angles' names. Let me check the angles again:

Angle BOF, DOA, AOE, DOE. Let me try to visualize or sketch this mentally. Points A, B, D, E, F are involved. Since all angles are at point O, maybe the rays OA, OB, OD, OE, OF are arranged around O. Let me consider that.

Assuming that all these angles are around point O, then the sum of all angles around O is 360 degrees. However, the given angles are BOF, DOA, AOE, DOE. Wait, maybe some of these angles overlap or are parts of each other?

Alternatively, maybe some of these angles are adjacent or supplementary. Let me see:

For instance, Angle DOA is between points D, O, A. Angle AOE is between A, O, E. Angle DOE is between D, O, E. And Angle BOF is between B, O, F. Hmm. It's a bit unclear without a diagram, but since the sum of these four angles is 360, it suggests that these angles together cover the entire circle around O. However, if there are overlapping angles or if some angles are parts of others, there could be another relation.

Wait, but maybe some of these angles are vertical angles, or linear pairs, or something else. Alternatively, maybe some angles are formed by intersecting lines, leading to other angle relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express y in terms of x via another equation. But how?

Wait, unless there's a typo in my initial thought. Let me re-express the sum again:

Original sum equation:

(7x + 9) + (7y -4) + (11x -1) + (2y +5) = 360  
Which simplifies to:

18x +9y + (9 -4 -1 +5) = 360  
Calculating constants: 9 -4 is 5, minus 1 is 4, plus 5 is 9. So yes, 18x +9y +9=360  
Then subtract 9: 18x +9y = 351  
Divide both sides by 9: 2x + y = 39  
So we get equation 2x + y = 39. But we need another equation to solve for x and y. Where does that come from?

Perhaps there's a relationship between the angles that I haven't considered yet. Let me think about the angles again. Are there any other angle relationships? For example, maybe Angle BOF relates to other angles?

Looking at the angles:

Angle BOF: This is between points B, O, F.  
Angle DOA: Between D, O, A.  
Angle AOE: Between A, O, E.  
Angle DOE: Between D, O, E.  

Maybe some of these angles are adjacent or form straight lines. For example, if points A, D, E, F, B are arranged around O, then certain angles might add up.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle DOA and Angle AOE share the side OA, making them adjacent. Similarly, Angle DOE is between D and E, which might relate to other angles.

Wait, if I imagine point O with several rays going out: say, ray OD, OA, OE, OF, and OB. Let's assume that the order of the points around O is such that the angles between them are as follows.

Suppose the points are arranged in the order B, D, A, E, F around point O. Not sure, but let's think.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express y in terms of x through another angle relationship. For instance, if there's a triangle or another figure involving those angles.

Wait, maybe Angle BOF is composed of other angles. For example, if there's a line from O to some point, creating smaller angles. For instance, suppose that angle BOF is made up of angles BOD and DOF. But I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, considering that Angle DOA and Angle AOE are adjacent, forming a larger angle. For instance, if you have angle DOA and AOE next to each other, then the total angle DOE would be... Wait, angle DOE is given as 2y +5. Maybe that's the same as angle DOA plus angle AOE? Let me check.

If points D, O, A, E are arranged such that OA and OE are adjacent to OD. Then, angle DOA is between OD and OA, and angle AOE is between OA and OE. So combining those, the total angle between OD and OE would be angle DOA + angle AOE. Which would be (7y -4) + (11x -1). But angle DOE is between D and E, so that should be the same as the total of those two angles. Therefore, angle DOE = angle DOA + angle AOE. Hence:

2y +5 = (7y -4) + (11x -1)

Let me write that equation:

2y +5 = 7y -4 + 11x -1  
Simplify RHS: 7y +11x -5  
So:

2y +5 = 7y +11x -5  
Bring all terms to left:

2y +5 -7y -11x +5 =0  
Combine like terms:

-5y -11x +10 =0  
Rearranged:

11x +5y =10  
Wait, but earlier we had from the sum of angles:

2x + y = 39  
Now we have another equation: 11x +5y =10 ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculation again. 

Starting with 2y +5 = 7y -4 + 11x -1  
Right-hand side: 7y -4 -1 +11x = 7y -5 +11x  
So equation is 2y +5 = 11x +7y -5  
Subtract 2y +5 from both sides: 0 = 11x +7y -5 -2y -5 → 11x +5y -10 =0 → 11x +5y =10

Yes. Now, from before, we had 2x + y =39. 

So now we have two equations:

1. 2x + y = 39  
2. 11x +5y =10  

But solving these equations:

From equation 1: y = 39 -2x  
Plug into equation 2: 11x +5*(39 -2x)=10  
Calculate:

11x + 195 -10x =10  
Simplify:

x +195 =10  
→ x = 10 -195 = -185

That gives x=-185, which is impossible since angles can't have negative measures. Clearly, there's an error here. What went wrong?

Hmm. Let me retrace. The assumption that angle DOE equals angle DOA + angle AOE may be incorrect. Why did I think that?

Because if angle DOA is between D-O-A and angle AOE is between A-O-E, then combining them would give the angle between D-O-E, which is angle DOE. But that would require that points D, A, E are arranged in such a way that OA is between OD and OE. But if that's the case, then angle DOE would be the sum of DOA and AOE. However, if the points are arranged differently, this might not hold.

Alternatively, maybe angle DOE is not the sum but something else. Perhaps the angles overlap or are adjacent in a different configuration.

Alternatively, maybe angle BOF is related to other angles. Let me consider that.

Another possibility: If points A, B, D, E, F are arranged around O, then maybe some angles are vertical or supplementary. For example, if lines BF and DE intersect at O, creating vertical angles.

Alternatively, perhaps angle BOF is part of a triangle or another figure. Without knowing the exact figure, it's challenging, but perhaps there's another relationship.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me go back. The sum of the four angles is 360. But if there are overlapping angles or if some angles are actually parts of others, then the sum might not account for overlaps. But the problem says SumOf(...) equals 360, implying that the total of those four angles is 360, suggesting that they do not overlap and together make a full rotation.

But if that's the case, then why are there two variables? There must be another relationship. Let me think again. Maybe there's another equation from another pair of angles?

Alternatively, maybe angle BOF and another angle are related. For instance, if there's a straight line or something.

Wait, let's consider that angle BOF and angle DOA might be adjacent. Suppose that angle BOF is adjacent to angle DOA, forming a straight line. But that would imply that their sum is 180 degrees. But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps angle BOF is equal to angle DOE or something. But without knowing the figure, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the previous step. Let me check again.

Earlier, I assumed that angle DOE equals angle DOA + angle AOE, leading to an equation that resulted in an invalid solution. That suggests that assumption was wrong. So maybe angle DOE isn't the sum of DOA and AOE. Let me think of another possibility.

Suppose that angle AOE and angle DOE are adjacent, forming a larger angle. Or perhaps angle AOE and angle BOF are related.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved where the angles sum to 180. For example, if points A, B, D, E are connected in a triangle.

Alternatively, let's consider that the problem has a typo or missing info? No, probably not. The user provided all the predicates.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the angles given are part of a polygon or star shape, leading to other equations. But without seeing the figure, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in how I set up the initial equation. Let me verify again the sum:

Given that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(BOF)), MeasureOf(Angle(DOA)), MeasureOf(Angle(AOE)), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE)), 360). So that means:

MeasureOf(BOF) + MeasureOf(DOA) + MeasureOf(AOE) + MeasureOf(DEO) = 360.

Wait, but what's the measure of angle DOE? Is that angle DOE or angle DOA? Let me check the original list:

The angles are BOF, DOA, AOE, DOE. Yes, DOE is angle DOE.

So the four angles are BOF, DOA, AOE, DOE. Their sum is 360. So assuming they are around point O, their sum being 360 makes sense.

But then why are there two variables? Unless there's another relationship between the angles. For example, if angle BOF and angle DOE are vertically opposite or something. Or if there are other angles that are equal due to some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe angle BOF is equal to angle AOE? Or some other relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where two angles are expressed in terms of x and y, leading to another equation.

Wait, but without knowing the exact figure, it's difficult. Maybe I missed an angle relationship. Let me think again about the angles.

Let me consider that points A, D, E, F, B are placed around point O. Let me try to assign directions:

Imagine point O with several rays coming out. Let's say the order of the points around O is B, D, A, E, F. Then:

- Angle BOF would be between B and F. If F is next to B, then angle BOF could be a large angle. But without knowing where F is, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe angle BOF and angle DOE are supplementary or something.

Wait, here's another thought: Maybe angle BOF is equal to angle DOE. If that's the case, then 7x +9 = 2y +5 → 7x -2y = -4. Then we'd have two equations:

1. 2x + y = 39  
2. 7x -2y = -4  

Let me try solving these. From equation 1: y = 39 -2x. Plug into equation 2:

7x -2*(39 -2x) = -4  
7x -78 +4x = -4  
11x = 74  
x = 74 / 11 ≈ 6.727… which is not among the options. So this assumption is likely wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle BOF is equal to angle AOE. So 7x+9 = 11x -1 → 7x +9 =11x -1 → 9 +1 = 4x → x=10/4=2.5. Not matching options either.

Alternatively, maybe angle DOA and angle AOE are supplementary? Like, if they form a straight line. So 7y -4 + 11x -1 = 180 → 7y +11x = 185. Then with our previous equation 2x + y =39. Let's see:

Equation 1: 2x + y =39  
Equation 2: 11x +7y =185  

Let me solve these. Multiply equation 1 by 7: 14x +7y = 273  
Subtract equation 2: (14x +7y) - (11x +7y) = 273 -185 → 3x =88 → x=88/3≈29.33. Still not matching options.

This approach isn't working. Maybe I need to reconsider the initial setup. Perhaps the sum of the four angles is not 360, but there's another constraint. Wait, the problem states SumOf(..., 360), so it's definitely 360. So the equation is correct.

But then how to find another equation? Maybe there's another relationship between the angles. Let me think about the fact that angle BOF and angle DOE might be related through some geometric property.

Wait, maybe the points are arranged such that angle BOF and angle DOE are vertical angles, hence equal. So 7x+9 = 2y+5 → 7x -2y = -4. Again, same as before.

With equations:

1. 2x + y =39  
2. 7x -2y =-4  

Let me solve this system:

From equation 1: y =39 -2x  
Plug into equation 2: 7x -2*(39 -2x) =-4  
Expand: 7x -78 +4x =-4 → 11x =74 → x=74/11 ≈6.727. Not helpful.

Alternative idea: Maybe angle BOF and angle AOE are supplementary. So 7x+9 + 11x -1 = 180 → 18x +8 =180 → 18x=172 → x=172/18≈9.555. Not in options.

Alternatively, maybe angle DOA and angle DOE are supplementary. So 7y -4 +2y +5 =180 →9y +1=180 →9y=179 → y=19.888. Plugging back into equation 2x + y =39 → 2x =39 -19.888=19.112 → x≈9.556. Still no good.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the way I combined the angles? Let me check again the sum equation.

Original sum:

(7x +9) + (7y -4) + (11x -1) + (2y +5) = 360  
Compute term by term:

7x +9 +7y -4 +11x -1 +2y +5  
Group x terms: 7x +11x =18x  
Group y terms:7y +2y =9y  
Constants: 9 -4 -1 +5 = 9-4=5; 5-1=4; 4+5=9. Correct.

So equation: 18x +9y +9 =360 → 18x +9y =351 → divide by 9: 2x + y =39. Correct.

Thus, we need another equation. Since I'm stuck, maybe I need to look for another relationship. Let me think about possible configurations.

What if the points are arranged such that angle BOF and angle DOE are vertical angles, making them equal. So 7x +9 =2y +5 →7x -2y =-4. As before. With equation 2x +y =39.

Let me try solving this system again:

Equation 1: 2x + y =39  
Equation 2:7x -2y =-4  

Multiply equation 1 by 2: 4x +2y =78  
Add to equation 2: 7x -2y +4x +2y =-4 +78 →11x =74 →x=74/11 ≈6.727. Not matching options.

But the answer choices are 11,12,13,14. None of these fit. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe angle BOF is equal to angle AOE? Let's try that.

Set 7x +9 =11x -1 → 9 +1 =4x →x=10/4=2.5. Not helpful.

Or angle DOA equals angle AOE: 7y-4 =11x -1 →7y -11x =3. Combined with 2x + y=39. Let's solve:

From 2x + y=39 → y=39-2x. Substituting into 7y -11x =3:

7*(39-2x) -11x =3 →273 -14x -11x =3 →273 -25x =3 →-25x= -270 →x=270/25=10.8. Not in options.

Still no luck. Maybe there's a different relationship. Let me think about the angles around point O. If there are more than four angles, but the problem only includes these four. Wait, maybe there are other angles that sum to something else, giving another equation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where the sum of angles is 180. For example, if points A, E, F form a triangle with O. But without knowing the connections, it's hard to say.

Wait, here's another possibility: If angle BOF is part of a triangle with other angles. For example, if there's a triangle involving points B, O, and another point, but without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misread it? Let me double-check the given predicates.

The given measures are:

MeasureOf(Angle(BOF), 7x + 9)  
MeasureOf(Angle(DOA), 7y - 4)  
MeasureOf(Angle(AOE), 11x - 1)  
MeasureOf(Angle(DOE), 2y + 5)  
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(BOF)), MeasureOf(Angle(DOA)), MeasureOf(Angle(AOE)), MeasureOf(Angle(DOE)), 360)

Yes, that's correct. So the sum is 360. And we have 2x + y =39.

But we need another equation. Perhaps there's an implicit relationship between x and y from the angles' definitions. For example, if angle BOF and angle DOE are supplementary or something.

Wait, let's assume that angle BOF and angle DOE are supplementary, so their sum is 180. Thus:

7x +9 +2y +5 =180 →7x +2y =166.

Now, with 2x + y =39.

Let me solve this system:

Equation 1: 2x + y =39  
Equation 2:7x +2y =166  

Multiply equation 1 by 2: 4x +2y =78  
Subtract from equation 2: (7x +2y) - (4x +2y) =166 -78 →3x=88 →x=88/3 ≈29.33. Still not matching options.

Not helpful.

Another idea: Maybe angle BOF and angle AOE are vertical angles? So 7x +9 =11x -1 → as before, x=2.5. No.

Alternatively, maybe angle DOA and angle BOF are supplementary? So 7y -4 +7x +9 =180 →7x +7y =175 →x + y =25. With 2x + y =39. Subtract: (2x + y) - (x + y)=39 -25 →x=14. Ah! This gives x=14, which is one of the options!

Let me check this. Assume that angle DOA and angle BOF are supplementary. So their sum is 180.

Thus:

7y -4 +7x +9 =180 →7x +7y +5 =180 →7x +7y =175 →x + y =25.

Now, we have two equations:

1. 2x + y =39  
2. x + y =25  

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1: (2x + y) - (x + y) =39 -25 →x =14. 

So x=14. Which is option D. 

Let me verify if this assumption makes sense. Why would angle DOA and angle BOF be supplementary? That depends on the diagram. If the points are arranged such that these two angles form a straight line, then their sum would be 180. For example, if rays OD and OF are opposite, making angles DOA and BOF supplementary. This is plausible if the diagram shows that.

Since this leads to x=14, which is one of the answer choices, this must be the correct approach. 

Let me confirm by finding y. From equation 2: x + y =25 → y=25 -x =25-14=11.

Check if this fits into the original equations.

First, check the sum of angles:

Original sum equation: 18x +9y +9=360. Plugging x=14, y=11:

18*14 =252, 9*11=99, so total is 252 +99 +9 = 360. Correct.

Also, checking the supplementary angles: angle DOA =7y-4=7*11-4=77-4=73, angle BOF=7x+9=7*14+9=98+9=107. Sum is 73+107=180. Correct.

Thus, this assumption is valid, and x=14 is the correct answer.
