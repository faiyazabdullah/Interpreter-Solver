MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points F, H, K forming a triangle because Triangle(F,H,K) is given. Also, there are other points G and J. The lines FH, HK, FK are part of the triangle. Then there's a line GJ that's parallel to FK. 

We need to find x such that GJ is parallel to FK. The given lengths are FH = 21, HK = 7. Also, GH = x + 3.5 and HJ = x - 8.5. Hmm. Since GJ is parallel to FK, maybe there's some similarity or proportionality here? Like maybe similar triangles?

Wait, if two lines are parallel, then maybe the triangles formed by those lines are similar? Let me think. Let's consider the coordinates or use vectors? Or perhaps coordinate geometry? But since it's about proportions, maybe using the concept of similar triangles or the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem)?

Let me visualize the diagram. Points F, H, K form a triangle. Point G is connected to H, and point J is connected to H as well? Wait, the lines mentioned are Line(G,J) and Line(F,K). And they're parallel. So GJ || FK. 

So, maybe there's a transversal cutting these parallel lines? For example, if we look at the lines FH and HK, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe considering triangles involving GH and HJ?

Wait, since GJ is parallel to FK, then the ratio of segments created by a transversal should be equal. For instance, if a line crosses two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. But how does that fit here?

Alternatively, maybe triangle FHK has some relation with GJ? Let me check. Let's note that FH is 21, HK is 7. So FH is three times longer than HK. Because 21 divided by 7 is 3. So maybe there's a ratio involved here.

Now, looking at GH and HJ. GH is x + 3.5 and HJ is x - 8.5. If GJ is parallel to FK, then maybe the segments GH and HJ relate to the sides of the triangle FHK in some proportional way. 

Wait, perhaps the line GJ is cutting the sides FH and HK? Or maybe not. Wait, GJ is a separate line. Maybe points G and J are located somewhere such that when connected, GJ is parallel to FK. 

Alternatively, could there be a situation where GH and HJ are parts of a transversal intersecting the sides of the triangle? For example, suppose G is on one side and J is on another, creating a line parallel to FK. Let me try to imagine.

Suppose that line GJ intersects FH at G and HK at J? No, because the points are named differently. Wait, the lines given are Line(G,J) and Line(F,K). So line GJ is parallel to line FK. So maybe there's a parallelogram? Or maybe similar triangles?

Alternatively, using vectors. Suppose we assign coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point H at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since FH is 21 units long, and H is at (0,0), let me assume F is along the x-axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s say H is at (0, 0). Since FH is 21, and assuming F is along the x-axis, then F would be at (21, 0). Then, point K is such that HK is 7. But we don't know the direction of HK. However, since FHK is a triangle, K can be anywhere such that distance from H to K is 7. But without knowing angles, this might complicate things. However, since we have a line GJ parallel to FK, maybe we can find relations between coordinates.

But maybe instead of coordinates, think in terms of ratios. Since GJ || FK, then the ratio of GH to HF should be equal to the ratio of HJ to JK? Wait, not sure. Let me recall the Thales' theorem: if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side. But in this case, maybe GJ is parallel to FK, so maybe the line GJ is cutting two sides of a triangle proportionally?

Wait, if we consider triangle FHK, and a line GJ parallel to FK. Wait, but where is G and J located? Are they on the sides of the triangle? For example, if G is on FH and J is on HK, then line GJ would be parallel to FK. That seems plausible. Let me check.

Assume that G is on FH and J is on HK. Then, according to the converse of Thales’ theorem, if GJ is parallel to FK, then FG/GH = HJ/JK. Wait, but in this case, maybe FG/GH equals HJ/JK? Wait, let me clarify.

In triangle FHK, if a line GJ is drawn through points G on FH and J on HK, then GJ || FK implies that FG / FH = HJ / HK. Wait, maybe FG / FH = HJ / HK. Let me verify.

Alternatively, the ratio of the segments on the two sides should be equal. So, FG / FH = HJ / HK. Wait, but in our problem, GH is given as x + 3.5 and HJ is x - 8.5. Wait, GH would be the segment from G to H. So if G is on FH, then FH is split into FG and GH. Therefore, FG + GH = FH. Which is FG + (x + 3.5) = 21. Similarly, HJ is part of HK. Since HK is 7, then HJ + JK = 7. But HJ is given as x - 8.5, so x - 8.5 + JK = 7 => JK = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 15.5 - x.

If GJ is parallel to FK, then by the Thales' theorem, FG / FH = HJ / HK. Let me write that equation:

FG / FH = HJ / HK

But FG = FH - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 21 - x - 3.5 = 17.5 - x

And HJ is x - 8.5, HK is 7.

So substituting:

(17.5 - x)/21 = (x - 8.5)/7

Cross-multiplying:

7*(17.5 - x) = 21*(x - 8.5)

Divide both sides by 7:

17.5 - x = 3*(x - 8.5)

Compute RHS: 3x - 25.5

So:

17.5 - x = 3x - 25.5

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

17.5 + 25.5 = 3x + x

43 = 4x → x = 43 / 4 = 10.75. Wait, but none of the options are 10.75. The options are 12, 12.5, 14.5, 17.5. So something's wrong here. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equation?

Wait, maybe my assumption that FG/FH = HJ/HK is incorrect. Let me double-check the theorem. In Thales' theorem, if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, intersecting the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally. So, in triangle FHK, if line GJ is parallel to FK, then it should divide the sides FH and HK proportionally. So the ratio of FG to FH equals the ratio of HJ to HK. Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So why isn't the answer matching?

Wait, but maybe the line is not cutting FH and HK, but rather other sides. Let me think again. If GJ is parallel to FK, then maybe the line GJ is cutting lines FH and HK? But then the theorem applies. Alternatively, maybe the line GJ is cutting lines FH and HK extended?

Alternatively, maybe the points G and J are not on the sides FH and HK, but elsewhere. For example, maybe G is on FH extended, and J is on HK extended. But then the same idea applies.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is different. Wait, the given triangle is F, H, K. So lines FH, HK, and FK. So if we have line GJ parallel to FK, then perhaps G is on FH and J is on HK? But then the calculation gives x=10.75, which isn't among the options. So perhaps my setup was wrong.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the segments. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,H)), 21)" – so FH = 21.

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,K)), 7)" – HK = 7.

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,H)), x + 3.5)" – GH = x+3.5.

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), x - 8.5)" – HJ = x-8.5.

So GH is from G to H, which suggests that G is a point such that the length from G to H is x + 3.5. Similarly, HJ is from H to J, so J is a point such that HJ = x - 8.5.

But where are G and J located? The line GJ is parallel to FK. So, if we imagine that line GJ is parallel to FK, then perhaps points G and J lie on certain lines?

For example, maybe G lies on FH and J lies on HK? Let me try again with that assumption. If G is on FH, then FG + GH = FH. So FG = FH - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x.

Similarly, if J is on HK, then HJ + JK = HK. So JK = HK - HJ = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 15.5 - x.

Then, if line GJ is parallel to FK, by the converse of Thales' theorem, the ratio FG / FH = HJ / HK.

Which leads us to (17.5 - x)/21 = (x - 8.5)/7. As before.

Multiply both sides by 21*7 to eliminate denominators:

7*(17.5 - x) = 21*(x - 8.5)

As before, simplifying:

122.5 - 7x = 21x - 178.5

Combine like terms:

122.5 + 178.5 = 21x + 7x

301 = 28x → x = 301 / 28 ≈ 10.75. Still not matching the options. So either my assumption is wrong, or there's another relationship.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line GJ is not cutting FH and HK, but instead other lines? For example, if G is on FK and J is on... something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe triangle FHK is being used with G and J on different lines. Let me think of vector approaches.

Since GJ is parallel to FK, the vector GJ should be scalar multiple of vector FK. Let me denote coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates again. Let me take H as origin (0,0). Let me take F at (a, b) and K at (c, d). Then, vector FK is (c - a, d - b). Then, vector GJ should be parallel to this. But since G and J are points such that HG = x + 3.5 and HJ = x - 8.5. Wait, but HG is the length from H to G, and HJ is from H to J. So if H is at origin, then coordinates of G would be some point at distance x + 3.5 from H, and similarly for J.

But without knowing directions, this might be too vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of slopes. If GJ is parallel to FK, then their slopes are equal.

Let me try to assign coordinates more carefully. Let me place H at (0,0). Let me assume that line FH is horizontal for simplicity, so F is at (21, 0), since FH = 21. Now, point K is such that HK = 7. Let me assume K is at (0,7), making HK vertical. Wait, but then FK would be from (21,0) to (0,7). The slope of FK is (7 - 0)/(0 - 21) = -7/21 = -1/3. So line FK has slope -1/3.

Now, line GJ is parallel to FK, so it also has slope -1/3. Now, points G and J: GH = x + 3.5 and HJ = x - 8.5. Since H is at (0,0), G is some point at distance x + 3.5 from H, and J is some point at distance x - 8.5 from H. Let me parameterize their coordinates.

Let me assume that G lies along the x-axis. Wait, but if F is at (21, 0), and H is at (0,0), then FH is along x-axis. If G is on FH, then G would be somewhere along the x-axis. But then, the line GJ would go from G to J, which is at distance x - 8.5 from H. But where is J? If J is not on HK, but somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps J is on HK? Since HK is from (0,0) to (0,7). So if J is on HK, its coordinates would be (0, y), where y ranges from 0 to 7. The distance from H to J is |y|, since H is at (0,0). Given that HJ = x - 8.5, then y = x - 8.5. But since J is on HK, which goes from (0,0) to (0,7), y must be between 0 and 7. So x - 8.5 ≥ 0 → x ≥ 8.5, and x - 8.5 ≤ 7 → x ≤ 15.5. So x is between 8.5 and 15.5.

Meanwhile, G is at distance x + 3.5 from H. If G is on FH, which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (21,0), then G's coordinates would be (g, 0), where g is between 0 and 21. The distance from H to G is |g| = x + 3.5. So g = x + 3.5, since it's positive. So G is at (x + 3.5, 0). But wait, FH is from (0,0) to (21,0). So x + 3.5 must be less than or equal to 21. Hence, x ≤ 21 - 3.5 = 17.5. So x is between 8.5 and 17.5.

Now, line GJ connects G(x + 3.5, 0) to J(0, x - 8.5). The slope of GJ is ( (x - 8.5) - 0 ) / (0 - (x + 3.5)) = (x - 8.5)/(-x - 3.5) = -(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5).

This slope must equal the slope of FK, which is -1/3.

So set:

-(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5) = -1/3

Multiply both sides by -1:

(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5) = 1/3

Cross-multiplying:

3(x - 8.5) = x + 3.5

Expand:

3x - 25.5 = x + 3.5

Subtract x from both sides:

2x - 25.5 = 3.5

Add 25.5 to both sides:

2x = 29

x = 14.5

Ah! This gives x = 14.5, which is option C. So this seems to work. But earlier when I assumed the Thales' theorem approach, I got x=10.75. Why the discrepancy?

Because in this coordinate system, I assumed that G is on FH and J is on HK, which led to the slope condition. So this gives x=14.5. Which is option C. So why did the previous approach give a different result? Because I incorrectly applied the Thales' theorem. Perhaps I had the ratio inverted?

Let me check the slope method. Here, the slope of GJ equals slope of FK, leading to x=14.5. Let me verify with the given answer choices. Option C is 14.5. So this must be the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

But why did the first approach with Thales' theorem fail? Probably because I misapplied the ratio. Let me see. In the Thales' theorem, if line GJ is parallel to FK, then the ratio of segments on the two sides should be equal. But in this case, G is on FH and J is on HK. So the ratio FG / FH = HJ / HK. Wait, but in this case:

FG is from F to G. Since FH is from F(21,0) to H(0,0), and G is at (x + 3.5, 0). So FG is the distance from F to G, which is 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x. FH is 21. HJ is x - 8.5, HK is 7. So according to Thales' theorem, FG / FH = HJ / HK.

Plugging in:

(17.5 - x)/21 = (x - 8.5)/7

Cross multiply: 7*(17.5 - x) = 21*(x - 8.5)

Which simplifies to 122.5 - 7x = 21x - 178.5 → 122.5 + 178.5 = 28x → 301 = 28x → x = 301/28 = 10.75. But this contradicts the slope method. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the ratio is different. Maybe it's FG / GH = HJ / JK? Because in Thales' theorem, the ratio is the segments divided by the line. Let me think again. If a line cuts two sides of a triangle, then the ratio of the divided segments is equal. So if line GJ intersects FH at G and HK at J, then FG / GH = HJ / JK. Wait, that would make sense.

So FG / GH = HJ / JK. Let me compute that.

From above, FG = 17.5 - x, GH = x + 3.5. HJ = x - 8.5, and JK = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 15.5 - x.

Thus, (17.5 - x)/(x + 3.5) = (x - 8.5)/(15.5 - x)

Cross multiplying:

(17.5 - x)(15.5 - x) = (x + 3.5)(x - 8.5)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (17.5 - x)(15.5 - x) = (17.5)(15.5) - 17.5x -15.5x + x² = 271.25 - 33x + x²

Right side: (x + 3.5)(x - 8.5) = x² - 8.5x + 3.5x - 30.25 = x² - 5x - 30.25

Setting left = right:

271.25 - 33x + x² = x² -5x -30.25

Subtract x² from both sides:

271.25 - 33x = -5x -30.25

Bring all terms to left:

271.25 -33x +5x +30.25 = 0 → 301.5 -28x = 0 → 28x = 301.5 → x = 301.5 / 28 = ?

Calculate 301.5 ÷ 28. Let me do division:

28 × 10 = 280 → 301.5 -280 = 21.5 → remaining 21.5/28 = approx 0.767. Total x ≈ 10.767, which is roughly 10.75. Again, same as before. But this conflicts with the coordinate method giving x=14.5. So there's inconsistency here.

Wait, but in the coordinate method, we found x=14.5. So why is there a contradiction? Let me check the coordinate approach again.

In the coordinate system, with H at (0,0), F at (21,0), K at (0,7). Then, G is on FH at (x + 3.5, 0), and J is on HK at (0, x - 8.5). Then, slope of GJ is (x-8.5)/(-x-3.5) = -(x-8.5)/(x+3.5). Slope of FK is (7-0)/(0-21) = -1/3. Setting equal:

-(x-8.5)/(x+3.5) = -1/3 → (x-8.5)/(x+3.5)=1/3 → cross multiply 3(x-8.5)=x+3.5 → 3x -25.5=x+3.5 → 2x=29 → x=14.5.

So this gives x=14.5. But the Thales' approach gave x≈10.75. Where is the error?

Ah, I think the error is in the application of Thales' theorem. The line GJ is not necessarily cutting the sides FH and HK, but rather FH and HK extended. Or maybe the triangle is not FHK but another triangle. Wait, in the coordinate example, J is on HK, but G is on FH. So applying Thales' theorem, which requires the line to cut two sides of the triangle. So in this case, the line GJ cuts FH and HK, hence the ratio should hold. But why the two methods give different results?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption of where J is located. In the coordinate system, J is on HK, which is from (0,0) to (0,7). But if x=14.5, then HJ = x -8.5 = 14.5 -8.5 = 6. Which is within HK's length of 7. So J is at (0,6), which is valid. Then, G is at x +3.5 = 14.5 +3.5 = 18. So G is at (18,0). But FH is from (0,0) to (21,0), so G is at 18, which is between F (at 21) and H (at 0)? No, FH is from F(21,0) to H(0,0). So moving from F to H, the x-coordinate decreases from 21 to 0. So G is at (18,0), which is between F and H. Thus, FG = 21 -18 = 3, GH = 18 -0 = 18. Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, GH = x +3.5 = 14.5 +3.5 = 18, which matches. Then, HJ = x -8.5 = 6. So J is at (0,6). 

Now, according to Thales' theorem, FG / FH = HJ / HK. FG is 3, FH is 21. HJ is 6, HK is 7. So 3/21 = 6/7 → 1/7 = 6/7. Which is false. So this indicates that the assumption that the line GJ is parallel to FK is not satisfied, but in reality, the slope method shows it is. So why is this happening?

Wait, because the line GJ is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but rather extending them? Or perhaps the line GJ is cutting the extensions of the sides. Wait, in the coordinate example, G is on FH between F and H, and J is on HK between H and K. So the line GJ is inside the triangle. But according to the Thales' theorem, the ratio FG/FH should equal HJ/HK. But in this case, FG/FH = 3/21 = 1/7, while HJ/HK = 6/7. These are not equal. So why does the slope method show that GJ is parallel to FK? Because in this scenario, even though the line GJ is cutting the sides, the ratios are not equal, which contradicts Thales' theorem. What's going on?

Wait, this suggests that there's a miscalculation in the slope method. Let me recalculate the slope of GJ when x=14.5. With x=14.5, G is at (18,0), J is at (0,6). So the slope of GJ is (6-0)/(0-18) = 6/-18 = -1/3. Which matches the slope of FK (-1/3). So the line GJ is indeed parallel to FK. But according to Thales' theorem, the ratio should be equal. So why is this not holding?

Ah! Wait, Thales' theorem states that if a line is drawn through the two sides of a triangle, then the ratio of the segments is equal. But in this case, the line GJ is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but rather the side FH and the extension of HK? Wait, no. J is on HK, between H and K. So why is the ratio not matching?

Wait, let me recheck the Thales' theorem. The theorem says: if a line is parallel to one side of a triangle, then it divides the other two sides proportionally. In this case, line GJ is parallel to FK. So the triangle would be FHK, and the line GJ is cutting sides FH and HK. Wait, but in this case, the line GJ is cutting FH at G and HK at J. So according to Thales' theorem, FG / GH = HJ / JK. Wait, earlier I thought it was FG / FH = HJ / HK, but that may be incorrect.

Let me recall the exact statement of Thales' theorem. It states that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. So in triangle FHK, if line GJ is parallel to FK, then it should divide FH and HK proportionally. That means FG / FH = HJ / HK. But in our example, with x=14.5, FG=3, FH=21, HJ=6, HK=7. Then 3/21 = 6/7 → 1/7 = 6/7. Which is not true. So this suggests a contradiction. How come?

Wait, maybe the line GJ is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but rather FH and HK extended beyond H? For example, if J is beyond K on HK extended? Let me check. When x=14.5, HJ = x-8.5 = 6. Since HK is 7, then HJ=6 < HK=7, so J is between H and K. So why doesn't Thales' theorem hold? There must be a misunderstanding in the application.

Wait, perhaps the line is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but another pair of sides. Let me think of the triangle FKH. If line GJ is parallel to FK, then it should intersect the other two sides, which are KH and HF. So it intersects HF at G and KH at J. So the ratio should be FG / FH = HJ / HK. But in our case, FG=3, FH=21, HJ=6, HK=7. So 3/21 = 6/7 → 1/7 vs 6/7. Not equal. So this suggests that the line is not parallel, but in reality, the slope calculation showed it is. This is confusing.

Wait, but in reality, the slope calculation shows that the line GJ is parallel to FK, but according to Thales' theorem, it shouldn't. This contradiction must mean that my understanding of the theorem is incorrect. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the line GJ is parallel to FK, but the line is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but instead FH and HK extended. For example, if G is on FH extended beyond H, and J is on HK extended beyond K. But in our case, G is between F and H, and J is between H and K. So it should still satisfy the theorem. 

Alternatively, maybe the line GJ is cutting FH and HK, but the theorem applies to the entire triangle, so the ratio should be FG / FH = HJ / HK. But in this case, it doesn't hold, which suggests that the line is not parallel. But in reality, the slope calculation shows it is. So there's a paradox here. What's the resolution?

Wait, let's calculate the actual lengths. With x=14.5, GJ is parallel to FK. According to the slope method, yes. But according to the Thales' theorem, it should divide the sides proportionally. Why is there a contradiction?

Wait, perhaps the line GJ is not intersecting the sides FH and HK, but instead the extensions of those sides. For example, if G is on FH extended beyond H, and J is on HK extended beyond K. Let me test this.

Let me assume that G is on the extension of FH beyond H. Then, the length HG would be x +3.5, so if H is at (0,0), then G would be at (- (x +3.5), 0). But then the line GJ would go from G to J. Let me try this.

Let me redo the coordinate system with G on the extension of FH beyond H. So FH is from F(21,0) to H(0,0). Extending beyond H would be negative x-direction. So G is at (- (x +3.5), 0). Then, J is on HK. Let me assume J is on HK, at (0, y), where y = x -8.5. So the slope of GJ is (y - 0)/(0 - (- (x +3.5))) = y/(x +3.5). This slope should equal slope of FK, which is -1/3.

So:

y / (x +3.5) = -1/3 → y = - (x +3.5)/3.

But y = x -8.5, so:

x -8.5 = - (x +3.5)/3

Multiply both sides by 3:

3x -25.5 = -x -3.5

Add x to both sides:

4x -25.5 = -3.5

Add 25.5:

4x = 22 → x = 5.5. Which is not among the options. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if J is on the extension of HK beyond K. Let me say J is beyond K, so coordinates of J would be (0, 7 + t), where t > 0. Then, HJ = sqrt((0)^2 + (7 + t)^2) = 7 + t. Given that HJ = x -8.5, so 7 + t = x -8.5 → t = x - 8.5 -7 = x -15.5. So x must be greater than 15.5. 

Meanwhile, G is on FH. Let me assume G is between F and H. So G at (g, 0), where 0 ≤ g ≤21. Then, HG = x +3.5 → distance from H(0,0) to G(g,0) is g = x +3.5. So g = x +3.5. But since g ≤21, x +3.5 ≤21 → x ≤17.5. 

Now, line GJ connects G(x+3.5, 0) to J(0, 7 + t), where t = x -15.5. So slope of GJ is (7 + t - 0)/(0 - (x+3.5)) = (7 + t)/(-x -3.5). Set equal to slope of FK (-1/3):

(7 + t)/(-x -3.5) = -1/3 → (7 + t)/(x +3.5) = 1/3 → 3(7 + t) = x +3.5.

But t = x -15.5, so substitute:

3(7 + x -15.5) = x +3.5 → 3(x -8.5) = x +3.5 → 3x -25.5 = x +3.5 → 2x = 29 → x = 14.5. 

This gives x=14.5, which is option C. Now, with x=14.5, t = x -15.5 = -1. So t=-1, which means J is at (0,7-1)=(0,6), which is between H(0,0) and K(0,7). Wait, this brings us back to the earlier case where J is between H and K, and G is at x+3.5 =18, which is between F(21,0) and H(0,0). So this suggests that despite J being between H and K, the line GJ is parallel to FK, and the Thales' theorem is not directly applicable because the line is not cutting the sides of the triangle, but rather extending them? Or perhaps I misapplied the theorem.

Wait, in this scenario, the line GJ intersects FH at G (between F and H) and HK at J (between H and K). But according to the slope calculation, it is parallel to FK. But according to Thales' theorem, the ratio should hold. Why isn't it?

Let me recompute the ratio. FG is from F to G: F is at (21,0), G is at (18,0). So FG = 21 -18 = 3. FH is 21. HJ is from H(0,0) to J(0,6): 6 units. HK is 7. So FG/FH = 3/21 = 1/7. HJ/HK = 6/7. These are not equal. So why is the line parallel?

This suggests that there's a flaw in my understanding. How can a line cutting two sides of a triangle not satisfy the proportionality? It must be that my application of the theorem is wrong. 

Wait, maybe the theorem applies when the line is parallel to the third side. In this case, the line GJ is parallel to FK. So in triangle FHK, line GJ is parallel to FK, which is one of the sides. So according to the theorem, it should divide the other two sides proportionally. But in this case, it doesn't seem to. What's the issue?

Ah! Wait, the line GJ is parallel to FK, which is a side of the triangle. But in this case, the line GJ is cutting FH and HK, but the theorem states that the ratio of the segments on the two sides should be equal. But in our case, FG/FH ≠ HJ/HK. So this suggests either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding.

Let me calculate the ratios again. If GJ is parallel to FK, then by the theorem, FG/FH = HJ/HK. But in our case, FG=3, FH=21, HJ=6, HK=7. So 3/21 = 1/7, and 6/7. These are not equal. So why is the line parallel?

This suggests that there's a mistake in the assumption that the line GJ is cutting the sides of the triangle. Maybe the line GJ is not cutting the sides of the triangle FHK, but instead another triangle? Or perhaps the line GJ is cutting the extensions of the sides? Let me consider extending the sides.

If the line GJ is cutting the extensions of FH and HK, then the theorem would state that the ratio of the segments on the extensions should be equal. For example, if G is on the extension of FH beyond H, and J is on the extension of HK beyond K, then the theorem would apply. Let me try this.

Let me assume G is on the extension of FH beyond H, and J is on the extension of HK beyond K. So, for G, since HG = x +3.5, and H is at (0,0), G would be at (- (x +3.5), 0). For J, since HJ = x -8.5, and if J is on the extension of HK beyond K, then K is at (0,7), so J would be at (0, 7 + t), where t = HJ - HK = (x -8.5) -7 = x -15.5. So t = x -15.5.

Now, the line GJ connects G(- (x +3.5), 0) to J(0, 7 + t). The slope of GJ is [7 + t - 0]/[0 - (- (x +3.5))] = (7 + t)/(x +3.5). This must equal the slope of FK, which is -1/3. So:

(7 + t)/(x +3.5) = -1/3 → 7 + t = - (x +3.5)/3.

But t = x -15.5, so:

7 + x -15.5 = - (x +3.5)/3 → x -8.5 = - (x +3.5)/3.

Multiply both sides by 3:

3x -25.5 = -x -3.5 → 4x = 22 → x = 5.5. Which is not among the options. So this doesn't work.

So this approach also fails. What's going on?

Alternatively, maybe the line GJ is not cutting the sides of the triangle, but another configuration. Let me think again about the coordinate system where x=14.5 works. In that case, G is at (18,0), J is at (0,6). So line GJ connects (18,0) to (0,6). Let me calculate the equation of this line. The slope is (6-0)/(0-18) = -1/3, which matches FK. So the line is parallel. But according to Thales' theorem, this should imply that FG/FH = HJ/HK. But in this case, FG is 3, FH is 21, HJ is 6, HK is 7. 3/21 = 1/7, and 6/7. Not equal. So why is this happening?

Maybe the theorem applies to the entire segment, including the direction. For example, if the line cuts the sides in the opposite direction. Let me think about directed segments. In Thales' theorem, the ratios are signed depending on the direction. 

In this case, if we consider directed segments, FG is from F to G, which is towards H. So FG = 3, and FH is from F to H, which is -21 (if we consider direction). But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the theorem applies to the absolute values. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is not cutting the sides FH and HK, but another pair of sides. Wait, in triangle FHK, the sides are FH, HK, and FK. If the line GJ is parallel to FK, then it should intersect the other two sides, which are FH and HK. But in this case, it does intersect them. So why doesn't the theorem hold?

I think the confusion arises from the fact that the line GJ is not just cutting the sides, but also that the points G and J are not between the vertices. Wait, in our case, G is between F and H, and J is between H and K. So it should satisfy the theorem. But it doesn't. This suggests there's a fundamental error in my understanding.

Wait, let me try calculating the ratio of the segments using vectors. Vector FG is from F to G: G - F = (18,0) - (21,0) = (-3, 0). Vector FH is from F to H: H - F = (-21, 0). So the ratio of FG to FH is (-3,0)/(-21,0) = 1/7. Similarly, vector HJ is from H to J: J - H = (0,6) - (0,0) = (0,6). Vector HK is from H to K: K - H = (0,7) - (0,0) = (0,7). So the ratio of HJ to HK is (0,6)/(0,7) = 6/7. These ratios are not equal, which contradicts the theorem. But the line is parallel. This is a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that either the theorem is applied incorrectly, or there's a deeper geometric principle at play. Perhaps the line GJ is not cutting the sides of the triangle, but another configuration. Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not FHK, but another triangle? Or maybe the line GJ is part of a different triangle?

Alternatively, maybe the line GJ is parallel to FK, but not cutting the sides of triangle FHK, but instead another triangle. For example, if we consider triangle FGH or something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Given that the slope method consistently gives x=14.5, and this satisfies the condition that GJ is parallel to FK, I believe that this is the correct answer. The discrepancy with Thales' theorem might be due to an error in applying the theorem, possibly due to the line cutting the sides in a way that the theorem doesn't directly apply, or due to a miscalculation in the theorem's application. Since the coordinate method provides a consistent result and matches one of the answer choices, I'll conclude that x=14.5 is correct, corresponding to option C.
