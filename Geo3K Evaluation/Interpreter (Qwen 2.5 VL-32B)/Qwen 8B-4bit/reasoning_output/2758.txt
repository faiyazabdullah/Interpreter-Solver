D. 7.5

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this trapezoid problem. So, we have a trapezoid G, H, J, K. The given info includes that the bases GH and KJ are parallel, with lengths 17 and 13 respectively. The area is 75 square meters, and we need to find the height. 

First, I remember that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is (base1 + base2)/2 multiplied by the height. The bases here are the two parallel sides. Since they gave us the lengths of the two bases, we can plug those into the formula. Let me write that down:

Area = ((GH + KJ)/2) * height

We know the area is 75, GH is 17, KJ is 13. Plugging in:

75 = ((17 + 13)/2) * h

Adding 17 and 13 gives 30. Divided by 2 is 15. So:

75 = 15 * h

To find h, divide both sides by 15:

h = 75 / 15 = 5

So the height should be 5. Checking the answer choices, option C is 5. That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem mentions points and lines, but since it's a trapezoid with the two bases being parallel, the standard area formula applies. There's no mention of other complexities like non-right angles or anything else affecting the height. So yeah, the calculation looks right. The answer should be C.
