MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about a triangle where the ratio of its angles is 3:2:1, and we need to find which of the given options isn't an angle measure. The answer choices are 30, 45, 60, 90. 

First, I remember that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Since the ratio is 3:2:1, maybe I should start by figuring out the actual measures of each angle. Let me think. If the ratio is 3 parts, 2 parts, and 1 part, then adding them up gives 3+2+1=6 parts total. So each part would be 180 divided by 6, which is 30 degrees per part. Then multiplying each ratio by 30 gives the individual angles. 

So the first angle would be 3*30 = 90 degrees, the second is 2*30 = 60 degrees, and the third is 1*30 = 30 degrees. Wait, so the angles would be 90°, 60°, and 30°. That adds up to 180, which checks out. 

Now looking at the answer choices: A is 30, which is one of the angles. B is 45, which isn't in our list. C is 60, which is there. D is 90, also present. So the one that's not an angle measure here is 45. Therefore, the answer should be B. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions some predicates like Right(Triangle), RightAngle, and Equals with measures. Oh, but the user already gave us that the ratio is 3:2:1 and that one of the angles is 60, another 30, and another 90. So the triangle has angles 30, 60, 90. So the options given are A.30, B.45, C.60, D.90. So 45 isn't among the angles. Hence, the correct answer is B.
