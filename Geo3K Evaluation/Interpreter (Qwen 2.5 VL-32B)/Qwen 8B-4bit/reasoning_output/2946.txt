<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a kite named FGHJ. The question is asking for the measure of angle GFJ, which I think is the same as angle G F J. Let me start by recalling some properties of kites.

First, a kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. Also, one of the diagonals is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But wait, there are also some angle properties. In a kite, the angles between the unequal sides are called vertex angles, and they are equal. Wait, actually, no—maybe I should double-check that. Let me think again.

Wait, in a kite, the angles between the pairs of equal sides are equal. So if the kite is FGHJ, with FG and FH being one pair of adjacent sides, and GH and GJ being another? Or maybe it depends on how the vertices are ordered. Since it's a quadrilateral, the order matters. Kites are usually defined such that two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. So, if it's a kite F-G-H-J, then perhaps FG = FH and GH = GJ? Not sure yet. Maybe I need to look at the given predicates more carefully.

Looking back at the given predicates, there's a bunch of line segments and angles mentioned. Let me list them out:

Lines:
- Line(F,G)
- Line(G,H)
- Line(H,J)
- Line(J,F)
- Line(F,H)
- Line(G,J)

So connecting points F to G, G to H, H to J, J to F, F to H, and G to J. That forms a quadrilateral with those sides. Also, there are several angles mentioned:

Angles:
- Angle(G, F, H) → which would be ∠GFH?
Wait, angle notation is typically the middle point is the vertex. So Angle(G, F, H) means angle at point F between points G and H. So ∠G F H. Similarly, Angle(F, J, H) is ∠F J H, which is angle at J between F and H. 

Given that, and the measures:

MeasureOf(Angle(G, F, H)) is 128 degrees. So ∠GFH = 128°.

MeasureOf(Angle(F, J, H)) is 72°, so ∠FJH = 72°.

Also, there are some congruences: Line(F,G) ≅ Line(J,H) because Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(J,H)). And Line(F,H) ≅ Line(G,J). So FG = JH and FH = GJ.

Additionally, RightAngle(Angle(F, H, G)): which is ∠FHG? Wait, Angle(F, H, G) would be angle at H between F and G. So ∠F H G. So that's a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(F, H, J)) is ∠F H J, which is angle at H between F and J. Another right angle. Then RightAngle(Angle(G, J, F)) is ∠G J F, which is angle at J between G and F. And RightAngle(Angle(G, J, H)) is ∠G J H, angle at J between G and H. So these four angles at points H and J are all right angles?

Wait, but if there are right angles at H and J, maybe parts of the kite form rectangles or something? Hmm.

Also, BisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H)): So the line FH bisects angle GFH. Which is ∠GFH = 128°, so it's split into two equal angles. Similarly, FH bisects angle FJH, which is 72°, so that's split into two equal angles too.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points F, G, H, J forming a kite. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Since FG ≅ JH and FH ≅ GJ, that suggests that sides FG and JH are equal, and FH and GJ are equal. So if we consider the kite, maybe the two pairs of adjacent sides are FG & GH, and FH & HJ? Wait, but the congruence here says FG ≅ JH and FH ≅ GJ. So FG and JH are opposite sides? Or maybe not. Wait, in a kite, adjacent sides are congruent. So if FG is congruent to JH, but JH is adjacent to H and J. Wait, maybe I need to think about the structure of the kite.

Alternatively, since FH and GJ are congruent, maybe FH is one diagonal and GJ is another? Wait, but FH connects F to H, and GJ connects G to J. Are these diagonals? In a kite, the diagonals are not necessarily equal unless it's a rhombus. But here, FH and GJ are congruent. Also, the angles at H and J are right angles. Wait, maybe the kite is made up of two right triangles?

Let me try to break down the given info.

First, since FG ≅ JH and FH ≅ GJ. Also, angles at H and J have right angles. Let me check the angles:

At point H, we have ∠F H G (right angle) and ∠F H J (also a right angle). So at point H, two right angles. Therefore, the sum of angles around H would be 180°, making the total of 90 + 90 = 180, implying that the lines FG and HJ are straight? Wait, no. Because point H is connected to G and J. Wait, but if ∠F H G and ∠F H J are both right angles, then that would mean that lines HG and HJ are both perpendicular to HF. So HF is like a common side, and HG and HJ are both perpendicular to it. So that would make HG and HJ lie along the same line, but since they are connected to H, that would imply that G and J are on opposite sides of HF. Wait, but that might not be possible unless HG and HJ are colinear. But that seems conflicting with the kite structure.

Alternatively, maybe the two right angles at H are part of different triangles. For example, triangle FGH and triangle FJH. Since FH is a common side, and both angles at H are right angles, so triangles FGH and FJH are right triangles with hypotenuse FH. Given that FG ≅ JH and FH ≅ GJ.

Wait, let's note the congruencies. From the given:

Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(J,H)) → FG = JH.

Congruent(Line(F,H), Line(G,J)) → FH = GJ.

So in triangle FGH and triangle JHF? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

In triangle FGH: FG is one leg, GH is another, and FH is the hypotenuse (since ∠F H G is a right angle). Similarly, in triangle FJH: FJ is one leg, JH is another, and FH is the hypotenuse. Wait, but JH is congruent to FG, and FH is congruent to GJ.

But maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me take it step by step.

We know that ∠GFH is 128°, and FH bisects this angle. So the angle ∠GFH is split into two equal angles by line FH. Wait, no, the line FH is splitting the angle at F. Wait, angle GFH is at point F between points G and H. So the line FH is one of the sides of the angle. Wait, but FH is a line segment from F to H. So if the line FH bisects angle GFH, then it splits that angle into two equal parts. However, angle GFH is already formed by FG and FH. Wait, that doesn't make sense. How can line FH bisect angle GFH? Because FH is one of the sides of the angle. Unless there's another line involved.

Wait, the predicate says: BisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H)). So the line FH is bisecting the angle at F, which is ∠GFH. But if FH is one of the sides of that angle, then how can it bisect it? Wait, that seems impossible unless the angle is zero, which isn't the case here. There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicate. Let me recheck. The given predicate is:

BisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H))

Which means that the line FH bisects angle GFH. But angle GFH is at point F, between G and H. The line FH starts at F and goes to H. So if we're talking about bisecting angle GFH, which is between FG and FH, then the bisector would be a line starting at F and going somewhere inside the angle. But the line FH is one of the sides of the angle. This seems contradictory. Unless there's a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Wait, maybe the line FH is not the side of the angle, but rather another line? No, the line FH is from F to H. So angle GFH is formed by FG and FH. The bisector of that angle would be a line starting at F and splitting the angle between FG and FH. But the given line is FH itself. That doesn't make sense. So there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the angle is not ∠GFH but something else? Let me check the notation again. The angle is written as Angle(G, F, H), which according to standard notation means the angle at point F between points G and H. So yes, that's ∠GFH. So the line FH is one of the sides of that angle. Hence, the line FH cannot bisect that angle unless the angle is zero. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which suggests that perhaps I've misunderstood the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the line FH is not the side but another line? Wait, the line FH is from F to H, which is one of the sides of the angle. Alternatively, could there be a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I need to reinterpret the predicates differently.

Wait, maybe the line FH is not the same as the side FH. Wait, the line FH is the same as the segment FH. So the line FH is the same as the side FH. Therefore, the line FH cannot bisect the angle at F, which is between FG and FH. This suggests that either there's an error in the problem or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH, but another angle. Let me check the predicates again. The given bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H)) — so it's supposed to bisect Angle(G, F, H), which is ∠GFH. So this seems problematic. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem? Or maybe I'm missing a key insight.

Alternatively, maybe the line FH is acting as a bisector in a different way. Suppose that the angle at F is split by another line, but the line FH is somehow involved. Wait, but if the line FH is one of the sides, then the angle between FG and FH is just the angle ∠GFH. To bisect that angle, we need a line from F that splits it into two equal parts. However, since FH is one side, the other side is FG. So the bisector would be a line from F that divides the angle between FG and FH. But the given line is FH, which is one of the sides. This still doesn't make sense.

Wait, unless the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH but another angle involving FH. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the angle notation. Let me confirm: Angle(A, B, C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(G, F, H) is angle at F between G and H. So that's definitely ∠GFH.

This seems like a contradiction. Unless the line FH is not the side FH but another line. Wait, maybe the line FH is referring to the entire line passing through F and H, not just the segment. But even then, the angle between FG and the line FH would require the bisector to be a line from F, which is already part of the angle. So this seems impossible.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's an error in the problem, but assuming that it's correctly formulated, I need to proceed. Perhaps I need to consider that the line FH is not part of the angle but is acting as a bisector in another way. Or maybe the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH but another angle involving F and H.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the labeling of the kite. Let me recall that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. But here, we have right angles at H and J. Let me see.

Earlier, there were right angles at ∠F H G and ∠F H J. So at point H, there are two right angles. So the lines FG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH. Therefore, FG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH, meaning they are parallel to each other. Wait, but FG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH, so they must be parallel. So FG || HJ. But in a kite, adjacent sides are congruent. Wait, FG and HJ are congruent because of the Congruent(Line(F,G), Line(J,H)).

So if FG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH and are congruent, then the figure might be symmetric with respect to FH. Also, FH is a diagonal, and since FG and HJ are congruent and perpendicular to FH, the kite might be symmetric over FH. So the other diagonal would be GJ, which is congruent to FH.

But earlier, we had that FH ≅ GJ. So FH and GJ are congruent. So if FH is a diagonal, and GJ is another diagonal, then they are congruent. In a kite, the diagonals are not usually congruent unless it's a square or a rhombus. But here, it's a kite, so maybe it's a special case where the diagonals are congruent and perpendicular? Wait, but in that case, it would be a square or a rhombus. But there are right angles at H and J, so maybe this is a square?

Wait, but the angles at F are given as 128° and 72°, which don't add up to 180°, so it's not a rectangle. Hmm. Let me try to visualize.

Assuming that FH is a vertical line, and FG and HJ are horizontal lines perpendicular to FH. So point F is at the bottom left, H is at the top, G is to the right of F, and J is to the left of H? Wait, not sure. Let me draw this mentally.

Point F, with FG and FH as sides. Since ∠GFH is 128°, which is obtuse. But if FG and FH are perpendicular to each other? No, because if FG and FH are both perpendicular to FH, then FG would be parallel to FH, which can't be. Wait, earlier conclusion was that FG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH, hence parallel. So FG || HJ.

Then, since FG ≅ HJ, and they are parallel, the figure might form a parallelogram? But a kite is not necessarily a parallelogram. Wait, but if two pairs of adjacent sides are congruent, and FG and HJ are congruent and parallel, then maybe it's a rhombus? But again, the angles don't fit.

Alternatively, considering that there are right angles at H and J. At point H, we have ∠F H G and ∠F H J as right angles. So, at point H, the lines HG and HJ are both perpendicular to FH. So, point G is connected to H, and point J is connected to H. So, if FH is a vertical line, then HG and HJ are horizontal lines extending from H. So, G is to the left of H, and J is to the right of H? Wait, but then FG and HJ would be... Let me think.

Suppose FH is vertical. Point F is at the bottom, H is at the top. At H, lines HG and HJ are horizontal. So G is to the left of H, and J is to the right of H. Now, FG connects F to G, which would be a slant line from F to G. Similarly, HJ connects H to J. Since HJ is horizontal, and JH is congruent to FG. Also, FH is congruent to GJ. So, GJ connects G to J. Let me see.

Now, angle GFH is at F, between G and H. So, from point F, the lines FG and FH. We know that ∠GFH is 128°, and FH bisects this angle. Wait, but earlier confusion remains. If FH is one of the sides, how can it bisect the angle? This suggests that maybe there's another line involved, but the problem states that line FH bisects angle GFH. This implies that there's a line from F that splits angle GFH into two equal parts. But the line FH is one of the sides of the angle. This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that line FH bisects another angle? Like, maybe there's a typo, and it should be another angle? For instance, if it's supposed to bisect angle G F J instead of angle G F H. But that's speculation. Alternatively, maybe the line FH is not directly part of the angle but acts as a bisector. Let me assume that there's a line from F that splits ∠GFH, and that line is FH. But that doesn't make sense unless the angle is zero. This is very confusing.

Perhaps I should focus on the given angles and congruences, ignoring the bisecting condition temporarily. Let me see.

We have angle GFH = 128°, angle FJH = 72°, and the right angles at H and J. Also, the congruences FG = JH and FH = GJ.

Let me consider triangle FGH and triangle FJH. Both are right triangles since ∠F H G and ∠F H J are right angles. So, triangle FGH has legs FG and HG, hypotenuse FH. Triangle FJH has legs FJ and HJ, hypotenuse FH. Given that FG = HJ and FH = GJ.

Wait, if FG = HJ, and FH = GJ, then in triangle FGH and triangle JHF, maybe they are congruent?

Wait, triangle FGH has sides FG, HG, FH. Triangle JHF has sides JH, HF, FJ. Given that FG = JH, FH = GJ, and since FH is common? Wait, no. Wait, GJ is equal to FH, so GJ = FH. So in triangle FGH, the hypotenuse is FH, and in triangle FJH, the hypotenuse is FH. Also, FG = HJ. So if we consider triangles FGH and JHF:

FG = HJ (given),
FH = GJ (given),
and angle at H is right angle in both cases.

Wait, but triangle FGH has a right angle at H, and triangle JHF has a right angle at H as well. So, by hypotenuse-leg congruence, triangles FGH and JHF are congruent. Therefore, corresponding parts are equal. So, angle at F in triangle FGH (∠GFH) is equal to angle at F in triangle JHF (∠JFH)? Wait, but ∠GFH is given as 128°, and ∠JFH would be the angle at F between J and H. Wait, but that's part of the angle we need to find.

Wait, this seems promising. If triangles FGH and JHF are congruent, then angle at F in triangle FGH (∠GFH) equals angle at F in triangle JHF (∠JFH). But ∠GFH is 128°, so ∠JFH would also be 128°. But angle JFH is part of the larger angle at F. Wait, let me clarify.

Point F is connected to G, H, and J. So, the angles at F are ∠GFH and ∠JFH. But since triangles FGH and JHF are congruent, and ∠GFH = 128°, then ∠JFH is also 128°. But that would imply that the total angle at F is ∠GFH + ∠JFH = 128 + 128 = 256°, which is impossible because the maximum angle in a polygon is less than 360°, but in a quadrilateral, the sum of angles is 360°. Wait, but this suggests inconsistency.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Let me think again. If triangles FGH and JHF are congruent, then ∠GFH corresponds to ∠JFH. So ∠GFH = ∠JFH = 128°. But then the total angle at point F would be ∠GFH + ∠JFH? Or is there overlap? Wait, point F is connected to G, H, and J. So, the angle at F is between FG and FH, and between FH and FJ? Or is there another angle?

Wait, the kite is F-G-H-J-F. So, the sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF. The diagonals are FH and GJ. So, at point F, the sides are FG and FJ. Wait, but in the given data, there's also a connection from F to H. So, the lines at point F are FG, FH, and FJ. So, the angles at F would involve these connections.

Wait, but the given angles are ∠GFH (at F between G and H) and ∠FJH (at J between F and H). So, the angle at F involves lines FG, FH, and FJ. So, ∠GFH is between FG and FH, and ∠JFH is between FH and FJ. If those two angles are both 128°, then the total angle at F would be 128 + 128 = 256°, which is way too big for a simple quadrilateral. Thus, this suggests a mistake in my previous assumption.

Wait, but where did I get that ∠JFH is 128°? Earlier, I assumed that triangle FGH and JHF are congruent, leading to ∠GFH = ∠JFH. But maybe that's incorrect. Let me re-examine that.

Triangle FGH has right angle at H, with legs FG and HG, hypotenuse FH. Triangle JHF has right angle at H, with legs JH and HF, hypotenuse JF? Wait, no. Wait, triangle JHF would have legs JH and HF, and hypotenuse JF. Wait, but earlier we had FH = GJ. So GJ is congruent to FH. But JF is a different segment. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use variables.

Let me assign variables to certain lengths. Let’s say FG = x, HJ = x (since they are congruent). FH = y, GJ = y (since they are congruent). In triangle FGH, which is a right triangle at H, so by Pythagoras:

FG² + HG² = FH² → x² + HG² = y² → HG = sqrt(y² - x²).

Similarly, in triangle JHF, which is a right triangle at H, with legs HJ = x and HF = y, so hypotenuse JF = sqrt(x² + y²). But GJ = y, and GJ is the length from G to J. So, if we can relate GJ to other segments...

Wait, GJ is given to be congruent to FH, so GJ = y. So, the length from G to J is y. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates would help.

Let me place point H at the origin (0,0). Since there are right angles at H, let's set up coordinates so that FH is along the y-axis. So, point H is at (0,0), and FH is vertical. Let me define point F at (0, b), since FH is from F to H. Then, since there are right angles at H, lines HG and HJ are horizontal. So, point G is at (-a, 0) and point J is at (c, 0), where a and c are positive numbers.

Given that FG = HJ. FG is the distance from F(0,b) to G(-a, 0): sqrt((0 - (-a))² + (b - 0)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²). HJ is the distance from H(0,0) to J(c, 0), which is c. So, FG = sqrt(a² + b²) = HJ = c → sqrt(a² + b²) = c.

Also, FH is the distance from F(0,b) to H(0,0): b units. And GJ is the distance from G(-a, 0) to J(c, 0): c + a units. Given that FH = GJ → b = c + a.

So now, we have two equations:

sqrt(a² + b²) = c  
b = c + a

Substituting c = b - a into the first equation:

sqrt(a² + b²) = b - a

Square both sides:

a² + b² = (b - a)^2 = b² - 2ab + a²

Simplify:

a² + b² = a² + b² - 2ab  
Subtract a² + b² from both sides: 0 = -2ab → ab = 0.

This implies either a=0 or b=0. But a and b are lengths, so they can't be zero. Contradiction! This suggests that our initial assumptions are wrong.

Hmm, this indicates that there's an inconsistency in the given conditions. But since the problem is presented as solvable, there must be a mistake in my setup.

Wait, maybe the right angles aren't at H but elsewhere? Let me check the given right angles again:

RightAngle(Angle(F, H, G)) → ∠F H G, which is at H between F and G. So yes, that's the right angle at H.

RightAngle(Angle(F, H, J)) → ∠F H J, at H between F and J. So both right angles at H. So the previous coordinate system assumes that, leading to contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the assumption that both FG and HJ are perpendicular to FH. But how?

Wait, perhaps the right angles are not at H but at other points? Let me check:

The given right angles are:

RightAngle(Angle(F, H, G)) → ∠F H G (at H)

RightAngle(Angle(F, H, J)) → ∠F H J (at H)

RightAngle(Angle(G, J, F)) → ∠G J F (at J)

RightAngle(Angle(G, J, H)) → ∠G J H (at J)

So, at point J, there are two right angles: ∠G J F and ∠G J H. So, similar to point H, at point J, lines JF and JG are perpendicular to JH and JG? Wait, at point J, the angle ∠G J F is between G, J, F, which is at J between G and F. And ∠G J H is at J between G and H. So, these two angles at J are right angles. So, lines JG and JF are perpendicular to JH. Wait, similar to before.

So, at point J, lines JG and JF are both perpendicular to JH. So, similar to point H, this would imply that JG and JF are parallel. But since JG is congruent to FH (from the given Congruent(Line(F,H), Line(G,J))), and JF is another segment.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to reconsider the problem with the given angles and the bisectors.

The problem mentions that line FH bisects angle GFH (which is 128°) and angle FJH (which is 72°). Even though it seems contradictory, maybe there's a way to resolve this.

If line FH bisects ∠GFH, then it splits it into two equal angles. But since FH is one of the sides of the angle, this would mean that the angle is split into two angles: one is zero, and the other is the original angle. This is impossible unless the angle is zero, which it isn't. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the line FH is not the side but a different line? Or perhaps the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH but another angle? Let me check the predicates again.

The given bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H)) → Line FH bisects Angle GFH. So, the line FH is the bisector of angle GFH. But angle GFH is at point F, between G and H. The bisector of this angle would be a line from F that splits it into two equal parts. However, the line FH is one of the sides of the angle, so it can't be the bisector. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps the line FH is not the side but another line. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error, and the intended angle was different.

Alternatively, perhaps the line FH is the bisector of angle at H? Like, bisecting ∠F H G or something else. But the predicate specifies Angle(G, F, H), which is at F.

At this point, I'm stuck with this contradiction. Let me try to proceed with the given angles and see if I can find a relationship.

We have two angles at F: ∠GFH = 128°, and ∠FJH = 72°. Wait, ∠FJH is at J, not F. So at point F, the angles are ∠GFH and possibly others. If we can find the measure of ∠G F J, which is the angle at F between G and J. Wait, ∠G F J is at point F between G and J. So, it's the angle between FG and FJ. So, if I can find the measure of this angle, that's what we need.

To find ∠GFJ, which is at F between G and J. Let me consider the sum of angles at F. In a quadrilateral, the sum of angles at each vertex is determined by the shape. But without knowing the type of quadrilateral, it's hard to say. However, we know that there are right angles at H and J.

Wait, let's consider the total sum of angles in the quadrilateral. The sum of internal angles in any quadrilateral is 360°. We know two angles: at H, there are two right angles (each 90°), so total at H is 180°. At J, there are two right angles, adding another 180°. So total at H and J is 360°, leaving the remaining angles at F and G to sum to 0°, which is impossible. This suggests a contradiction, indicating that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup or my interpretation.

Wait, this can't be right. Let me double-check. The given right angles are at H and J:

- ∠F H G (at H) = 90°
- ∠F H J (at H) = 90°
- ∠G J F (at J) = 90°
- ∠G J H (at J) = 90°

So at point H, we have two right angles: 90° each, totaling 180°. At point J, similarly, two right angles: 90° each, totaling 180°. So the total at H and J is 360°, leaving the angles at F and G to sum to 0°, which is impossible. This indicates that the given conditions are inconsistent, which is likely due to a misinterpretation.

But since the problem is posed, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the right angles are not at H and J but at other points? Let me recheck the given predicates:

RightAngle(Angle(F, H, G)) → ∠F H G (at H)
RightAngle(Angle(F, H, J)) → ∠F H J (at H)
RightAngle(Angle(G, J, F)) → ∠G J F (at J)
RightAngle(Angle(G, J, H)) → ∠G J H (at J)

Yes, so at H and J, each has two right angles. This leads to the total of 360° at those points, leaving no room for other angles. This suggests that the figure is degenerate, or there's a mistake in the problem.

However, given that this is a math problem, there must be a way to interpret it correctly. Perhaps the right angles are not at H and J but at other points? Let me check the notation again.

For example, Angle(G, J, F) is ∠G J F, which is at J between G and F. And Angle(G, J, H) is ∠G J H, at J between G and H. So, at point J, there are two right angles: ∠G J F and ∠G J H. So, the lines JF and JG are perpendicular to JH. Similarly at point H, lines HG and HJ are perpendicular to FH.

This suggests that at point J, lines JF and JG are perpendicular to JH, and at point H, lines HG and HJ are perpendicular to FH. This creates a scenario where the figure has overlapping lines, possibly making it a star-shaped or self-intersecting quadrilateral. But even so, the sum of angles at H and J would still be 360°, leaving no room for angles at F and G.

This suggests that the problem may have a typo, or I am missing a key insight. Let me try focusing on the given angles and bisectors, ignoring the contradictions.

We know that angle GFH is 128°, and it is bisected by line FH. Wait, if it is bisected, then the angle is split into two equal parts. But since line FH is one of the sides, this would mean that the other part is zero, which is impossible. So, perhaps the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH but ∠G F J? Let me assume that there's a mistake in the predicate, and it should be Angle(G, F, J) instead of Angle(G, F, H). If that were the case, then line FH would bisect ∠G F J, which is the angle we need to find.

Assuming that, let's proceed. Let's suppose that the bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, J)) is the correct predicate. Then, line FH bisects ∠G F J, which is at F between G and J. Given that, and knowing other angles, we might be able to calculate it.

But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that line FH bisects the angle at F, which is ∠G F J, and the given angle GFH is part of it. Let me try this approach.

Let's assume that line FH bisects ∠G F J. So, ∠G F J is split into two equal angles by FH. Let's denote ∠G F J as x. Then, each of the two angles created by the bisector is x/2.

Now, we know that ∠GFH is 128°, which is part of ∠G F J. Wait, how? If line FH splits ∠G F J into two parts, then ∠GFH would be one of those parts. So, ∠GFH = x/2 = 128°, making x = 256°, which is impossible. So this also doesn't work.

Alternatively, if ∠GFH is part of ∠G F J, and FH bisects ∠G F J, then ∠GFH = ∠JFH. Given that ∠GFH is 128°, then ∠JFH is also 128°, making the total ∠G F J = 128 + 128 = 256°, which is still impossible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the problem's setup. However, since the problem is given, I must find a way to proceed. Perhaps the bisecting condition refers to another angle?

Let me revisit the given bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(F, J, H)). Wait, Angle(F, J, H) is ∠F J H, which is at J. So, line FH bisects ∠F J H, which is 72°. So, it splits it into two equal angles of 36° each. This makes sense, as 72° divided by 2 is 36°. So, this part is consistent.

So, the bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(F, J, H)) means that line FH bisects ∠F J H, which is at J. This makes sense. Similarly, the other bisectsAngle(Line(F, H), Angle(G, F, H)) must mean that line FH bisects ∠G F H, which is at F. But this is the earlier contradiction. However, if we ignore the contradiction and proceed, perhaps there's a way.

Assume that line FH bisects ∠G F H, which is 128°, so each part is 64°. Then, the angle between FG and FH is 64°, and the angle between FH and some other line is also 64°. But since FH is one of the sides, this would imply that the other part is zero, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the angle being bisected is not ∠GFH but another angle involving F and H. Let me think. If the line FH is bisecting ∠GFH, but ∠GFH is at F, then the bisector would be a line from F, but the given line is FH. This is the same issue.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradiction, I'll try to focus on the given angles and see if I can derive the answer using available information, ignoring the conflicting parts.

We know that at point J, there is a right angle ∠G J F (90°) and ∠G J H (90°). So, at point J, the two right angles suggest that lines JG and JF are perpendicular to JH. Similarly, at point H, lines HG and HJ are perpendicular to FH.

Assuming this, let's consider triangles at H and J.

At point H, lines HG and HJ are perpendicular to FH. So, FH is the altitude from H to some base. Similarly at J.

Let me consider triangle FGH and triangle FJH. As before, both are right triangles at H. Given that FG = JH and FH = GJ, and using the right triangles, we might find relationships between the angles.

In triangle FGH, right-angled at H, we have:

∠GFH = 128°, which is one of the acute angles. Wait, in a right triangle, the angles are 90°, and two acute angles summing to 90°. But 128° is obtuse, which is impossible. This indicates another contradiction. 

Ah! Here's the key issue: in a right triangle, all angles are less than 90°, except the right angle itself. So, if ∠GFH is 128°, which is obtuse, it cannot be part of a right triangle. This means that my earlier assumption that triangle FGH is a right triangle is wrong.

Wait, but the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(F, H, G)), which is ∠F H G, at H. So, triangle FGH has a right angle at H. But if ∠GFH is 128°, then the other angle in the triangle would be 180 - 90 - 128 = -38°, which is impossible. This confirms that there's a contradiction in the given conditions.

This suggests that the problem contains inconsistencies, making it unsolvable under normal geometric rules. However, since the problem is presented, I must conclude that there's a misinterpretation.

Let me try one last approach, ignoring the right angles and focusing on the angles and bisectors.

Given that line FH bisects ∠GFH (128°) and ∠FJH (72°). Assuming that despite the earlier contradiction, let's proceed.

If line FH bisects ∠GFH (128°), then each part is 64°. So, ∠GFH is split into two angles of 64° each. Similarly, line FH bisects ∠FJH (72°), creating two angles of 36° each.

Now, at point F, the angles are ∠GFH (split into 64°) and ∠JFH (split into 36°). Wait, but ∠JFH is part of the angle at F. Let me think.

Wait, if line FH bisects ∠GFH (128°), then the angle between FG and FH is 64°, and the angle between FH and some other line is also 64°. But what is the other line? It must be FJ, since the other side at F is FJ. So, the angle between FH and FJ is 64°, making the total angle at F between FG and FJ as 64° + 64° = 128°, but this would mean that the angle at F is 128°, but we also have the bisected angle from ∠FJH.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to summarize:

- ∠GFH = 128°, bisected by FH into 64° each.
- ∠FJH = 72°, bisected by FH into 36° each.

Assuming that the bisector FH splits ∠GFH into 64° and ∠JFH into 36°, then the total angle at F is 64 + 36 = 100°. But this is just a guess.

But the question asks for ∠G F J, which is the angle at F between G and J. If the total angle at F is 100°, then that would be the measure of ∠G F J. But this is speculative.

However, looking at the answer choices, 100° is not among them. The options are 72, 80, 128, 190. So, this suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Another idea: since FH bisects both ∠GFH and ∠FJH, and those angles are 128° and 72°, respectively, then the total angle at F is 128° + 72° = 200°, but this would mean ∠G F J is 200°, which is not an option. Still not matching.

Alternatively, since FH bisects ∠GFH (128°) into two parts, and ∠FJH (72°) into two parts, and if these bisected angles contribute to the total angle at F, then perhaps the angle at F is 128° + 72° = 200°, but this is again not in the options.

Given that I'm unable to resolve the contradictions in the problem, but needing to choose from the given options, I'll make an educated guess based on the given angles and bisectors.

If we consider that the angle ∠G F J is composed of the bisected angles from ∠GFH and ∠FJH. If ∠GFH is 128°, bisected into 64°, and ∠FJH is 72°, bisected into 36°, then the total angle at F is 64 + 36 = 100°, but this is not an option. Alternatively, if the angle ∠G F J is the difference between the bisected angles: 64 - 36 = 28°, which is not an option either.

Alternatively, since ∠GFH is 128°, and it's bisected, and ∠FJH is 72°, bisected, and the total angle at F is 128 + 72 = 200°, but this is not an option.

Wait, but the answer choices include 80°. Let me think: if the angle at F is 200°, and the total sum of angles in the quadrilateral is 360°, then the other angles at G and H would be 360 - 200 - 180 (from the right angles at H and J) = -100°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's no valid solution, but
