MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, the main geometric shape here is a rectangle WXYZ. The points W, X, Y, Z are all defined as points, and there are lines connecting them in order: W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z back to W. Also, there are diagonals like WZ and maybe other lines? Wait, looking at the Line predicates, there's Line(W,Z), so that's one diagonal. Then there are lines from each corner to point A: Line(W,A), Line(X,A), Line(Y,A), Line(Z,A). So point A seems to be connected to all four corners of the rectangle. 

Additionally, there are several RightAngle predicates confirming that each angle of the rectangle is a right angle. That makes sense because a rectangle has four right angles. 

Then there are these angle measures mentioned with Angle(1) to Angle(12). The first thing is that m∠1 is 30 degrees, and then there's a chain of equalities involving these angles. Let me list out the equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 30°
MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = MeasureOf(Angle(1)) → so Angle(2) is also 30°
MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 90° - MeasureOf(Angle(2)) → so Angle(3) would be 90 - 30 = 60°
Then MeasureOf(Angle(4)) = 90° - MeasureOf(Angle(3)) → 90 - 60 = 30°
MeasureOf(Angle(5)) = 90° - MeasureOf(Angle(4)) → 90 - 30 = 60°
MeasureOf(Angle(6)) = 90° - MeasureOf(Angle(5)) → 90 - 60 = 30°
And this pattern continues alternating between 30° and 60°?

Wait, but the question asks for the measure of ∠3, which according to the above would be 60°, so that would correspond to choice C. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the angles correctly.

But hold on, perhaps these angles refer to different angles formed by the lines from point A to the rectangle's vertices. Since A is connected to all four corners, maybe those connections form various triangles or intersecting lines inside the rectangle. For example, lines WA, XB, YC, ZD... Wait, actually, the lines are from A to each of W, X, Y, Z. So point A is connected to all four corners of the rectangle. Depending on where A is located, these lines could form different angles. 

But since the rectangle has right angles, and A is connected to all four corners, maybe we're dealing with some triangles inside the rectangle. For instance, considering triangle WAX, or maybe other triangles formed by these connections. However, without knowing the exact position of point A, it's tricky. But the problem gives us a series of angle measures starting from Angle(1) up to Angle(12), with each subsequent angle being 90 minus the previous. Starting with Angle(1)=30°, then Angle(2)=30°, Angle(3)=60°, Angle(4)=30°, etc., alternating between 30 and 60. 

But the problem says "Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠1=30." According to the given equations, ∠3 = 90 - ∠2. And since ∠2 equals ∠1, which is 30°, then ∠3 is 90-30=60°. Therefore, the answer should be 60°, which is option C. 

But wait, am I missing something? Maybe the angles aren't directly following that sequence because they might refer to different angles in the diagram. For example, maybe the angles are referring to angles formed at point A? Or angles within certain triangles. Let me think again. 

Since A is connected to all four corners of the rectangle, perhaps the angles mentioned are the angles at point A. For example, if you connect A to all four corners, then the angles around point A would be divided into parts. However, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, so if there are multiple angles formed by those lines. 

Alternatively, maybe each of these angles refers to angles in the triangles formed by the sides of the rectangle and the lines from A. For instance, consider triangle WAX. If we have lines WA, AX, and WX. But without knowing where A is, how can we determine the angles? 

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify where A is located. It just says that there are lines from A to each of the rectangle's corners. However, since the rectangle has right angles, and the lines from A to each corner, maybe there's a specific configuration implied. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles referred to in the problem are not at point A but somewhere else. But given the way the equations are set up, each angle depends on the previous one. Starting with Angle(1) as 30°, then each subsequent angle is 90 minus the prior. So the sequence would go:

Angle1: 30°
Angle2: 30°
Angle3: 90 - 30 = 60°
Angle4: 90 - 60 = 30°
Angle5: 90 - 30 = 60°
Angle6: 90 - 60 = 30°
Angle7: 90 - 30 = 60°
Angle8: 90 - 60 = 30°
Angle9: 90 - 30 = 60°
Angle10: 90 - 60 = 30°
Angle11: 90 - 30 = 60°
Angle12: 90 - 60 = 30°

So the odd-numbered angles (like 1,3,5,...) alternate between 30° and 60°, depending on the prior. Since Angle1 is 30°, then Angle3 is 60°, making it 60°, which is option C. 

Therefore, regardless of the specific geometric configuration, the equations define that ∠3 is 60°, so the answer should be C.
