MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have points M, P, N, and Q. There are several lines mentioned: Line(M,P), Line(P,N), Line(M,N). That suggests that triangle MPN is formed by connecting these points. Also, there are angles mentioned: Angle(M,P,N), Angle(P,N,M), Angle(M,N,P), and Angle(M,P,Q). 

The measures of two angles are given: MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N)) is 56 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(P,N,M)) is 45 degrees. Then there's an ExteriorAngle predicate involving Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), and Angle(P,N,M). Wait, exterior angles... Hmm, I remember that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. But here, maybe it's referring to some relationship between those angles?

Wait, let me clarify. The ExteriorAngle predicate is stated as ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So perhaps Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle to some triangle? Let me think. If we consider triangle MPN, but where does point Q come into play? The line Line(M,P) exists, and Point Q is another point. The angle Angle(M,P,Q) would be at point P, between points M, P, and Q. So maybe Q is somewhere such that PQ forms an extension or something?

But first, let's look at the given angles. In triangle MPN, we have two angles given: Angle at P (M,P,N) is 56°, and Angle at N (P,N,M) is 45°. Wait, wait. Wait, Angle(M,P,N) is the angle at point P between points M, P, N. Wait, no. Wait, the notation Angle(M,P,N) means the angle at point P between points M and N. Similarly, Angle(P,N,M) is the angle at point N between points P and M. So in triangle MPN, the angles at P and N are 56° and 45°, respectively. Therefore, the third angle at M (Angle(M,N,P)) can be found since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. 

Let me calculate that. Sum of angles in triangle MPN: 56 + 45 + Angle at M = 180. So Angle at M is 180 - 56 - 45 = 79 degrees. So Angle(M,N,P) is 79°. 

Now, the ExteriorAngle predicate mentions Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), and Angle(P,N,M). So maybe Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle related to triangle MPN? For example, if we extend one of the sides to form an exterior angle. Suppose we extend NP beyond P to a point Q, making PQ an extension. Then, the exterior angle at P would be supplementary to the angle inside the triangle at P. Wait, but the given Angle(M,P,Q) would be that exterior angle. 

Alternatively, maybe Q is a point such that PQ is forming an exterior angle with respect to triangle MPN. Let me try to visualize. If we have triangle MPN, with point Q somewhere. Since there's a line Line(M,P), so MP is a side. If we take point Q such that PQ is extended, then Angle(M,P,Q) would be adjacent to the original angle at P. 

But according to the ExteriorAngle predicate, Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle to the triangle. The theorem says that an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So if Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle at P, then it should equal the sum of the other two angles in the triangle. Wait, but the remote interior angles would be the ones not adjacent to the exterior angle. If the exterior angle is at P, then the remote interior angles would be at M and N. Wait, but the given angles at M and N are 79° and 45°, so their sum is 79+45=124°. Therefore, the exterior angle at P would be 124°, which would make Angle(M,P,Q) = 124°. However, the problem states that ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)), which might imply that Angle(M,P,Q) is the exterior angle, and the other two angles are the remote interior angles. 

But the problem gives us that MeasureOf(Angle(P,N,M)) is 45°, which is the angle at N in triangle MPN, and MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)) is 79°, which is the angle at M. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N? Wait, no. Let me check again. 

Angle(M,N,P): This is the angle at point N between points M, N, and P. Wait, no. Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at point N between points M and P. Which is the same as Angle(P,N,M)? Wait, no. Wait, Angle(P,N,M) is the angle at point N between points P and M. So yes, that's the same as Angle(M,N,P). Because the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N between M and P, which is the same as Angle(P,N,M). Wait, but earlier, we had MeasureOf(Angle(P,N,M)) is 45°, so that's the angle at N, and MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,N)) is 56°, which is the angle at P. 

Therefore, the third angle at M is 79°, which is Angle(M,N,P) (at N?) No, wait. Wait, Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N. Wait, no! Wait, Angle(M,N,P) has vertex at N, because the middle letter is N. So the three angles in triangle MPN are:

At P: Angle(M,P,N) = 56°,

At N: Angle(P,N,M) = 45°,

At M: Angle(M,N,P) = 79°, but wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the third angle at M would be Angle(M,N,P)? Or is it Angle(M,N,P) different?

Wait, no. Let me re-express the angles properly. Triangle MPN has vertices M, P, N. The angles are:

- At vertex M: between points N, M, P → Angle(N,M,P)

- At vertex P: between points M, P, N → Angle(M,P,N) = 56°

- At vertex N: between points M, N, P → Angle(M,N,P) ?

Wait, confusion arises here. Let me recall that the angle ABC is the angle at point B. So:

Angle(M,P,N) is the angle at P between M and N.

Angle(P,N,M) is the angle at N between P and M.

Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N between M and P. Wait, that's the same as Angle(P,N,M). So that implies that Angle(M,N,P) is the same as Angle(P,N,M), which is 45°, and Angle(M,P,N) is 56°, so the third angle at M would be Angle(N,M,P) ?

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should draw the triangle mentally. Points M, P, N. So triangle MPN. The angles:

- At point P: between M-P-N → angle M-P-N = 56°

- At point N: between P-N-M → angle P-N-M = 45°

- At point M: between N-M-P → angle N-M-P, which is the remaining angle. 

Sum of angles: 56 + 45 + x = 180 → x = 79°. So the angle at M is 79°, which is Angle(N,M,P).

Now, the ExteriorAngle predicate: ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So according to the definition, an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Here, Angle(M,P,Q) is supposed to be an exterior angle, and the two non-adjacent interior angles are Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). Wait, but Angle(M,N,P) is the same as Angle(P,N,M), which is 45°, and Angle(P,N,M) is also 45°, so adding them would give 45 + 45 = 90°, but that doesn't align with previous calculation. Wait, no. Wait, if Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, then the two non-adjacent interior angles would be the ones not adjacent to the exterior angle. So, if the exterior angle is at point P, then the two non-adjacent interior angles would be at M and N. Wait, but the given angles at M and N are 79° and 45°, so their sum is 124°, so the exterior angle would be 124°. But according to the ExteriorAngle predicate, the two angles being summed are Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). Wait, Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N, which is 45°, and Angle(P,N,M) is also the angle at N, which is 45°, so that would imply that the exterior angle is 45 + 45 = 90°, which contradicts. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the ExteriorAngle predicate refers to a different configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the exterior angle is not at point P. Let me think again. 

The given Angle(M,P,Q) is an angle at point P between points M, P, and Q. So, if Q is a point such that PQ is extending from P, then Angle(M,P,Q) would be an exterior angle. For instance, if we extend PN beyond N to a point Q, but that may not fit. Alternatively, if we extend PM beyond M to Q? Not sure. Wait, but the line Line(M,P) is given, so MP is a straight line. If Q is another point connected to P, forming Angle(M,P,Q). So, imagine point Q somewhere such that PQ is a line segment, and the angle between MP and PQ at point P is Angle(M,P,Q). 

In this case, if we consider that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle to triangle MPN. For example, if we extend NP beyond P to a point Q, then the exterior angle would be at P between MP and PQ. Wait, but that would make Angle(M,P,Q) an exterior angle. Then, according to the exterior angle theorem, this angle would be equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. The non-adjacent angles would be at M and N. Which are 79° and 45°, so their sum is 124°, hence Angle(M,P,Q) would be 124°. 

However, the ExteriorAngle predicate lists Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M) as the two angles being summed. Wait, Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N (which is 45°), and Angle(P,N,M) is also the angle at N (same as before?), which would be 45°. Adding them would give 90°, which conflicts with the previous thought. 

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angles involved. Let me double-check the notation. 

Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at point N between points M and P. So that's the angle at N in triangle MPN, which is given as 45°. Angle(P,N,M) is the angle at point N between points P and M. Wait, that's the same as Angle(M,N,P). So both are referring to the same angle. Hence, the ExteriorAngle predicate is saying that Angle(M,P,Q) (the exterior angle) is equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M), which are both 45°, giving 90°. But that would mean Angle(M,P,Q) is 90°, but how does that fit with the rest? 

Wait, but if the exterior angle is at point P, then the two remote interior angles are at M and N. But in this case, the remote interior angles would be at M (79°) and N (45°), totaling 124°, so the exterior angle would be 124°, not 90°. So why does the ExteriorAngle predicate say that Angle(M,P,Q) equals the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M), which are both 45°, implying 90°? That seems contradictory. 

Perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the ExteriorAngle predicate. Maybe the ExteriorAngle is referring to a different setup. Let me read the predicate again: ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So, the first argument is the exterior angle, and the second and third are the two angles that are summed. So according to the exterior angle theorem, the measure of the exterior angle equals the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 

So, if Angle(M,P,Q) is the exterior angle, then it should be equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. The two non-adjacent interior angles would be the ones not adjacent to the exterior angle. If the exterior angle is at point P, then the two non-adjacent interior angles are at points M and N. Which are 79° and 45°, summing to 124°, hence Angle(M,P,Q) = 124°. 

But according to the predicate, the sum is Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M), which are both 45°, totaling 90°. This discrepancy suggests that either my interpretation is wrong, or there's an error in the problem statement. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Let me re-examine:

Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N between M and P, which is the same as Angle(P,N,M), which is given as 45°. So if the exterior angle is supposed to be equal to the sum of these two, then it would be 90°, but according to the standard theorem, it should be 124°. So this suggests that perhaps the ExteriorAngle predicate is not referring to the usual exterior angle theorem. Or perhaps the problem is using a different configuration. 

Alternatively, maybe the exterior angle isn't at point P. Perhaps the exterior angle is at point Q? Wait, but the angle is named Angle(M,P,Q), which is at point P. 

Wait, unless the line PQ is not part of the triangle. Maybe Q is a point outside the triangle such that when you connect P to Q, creating an exterior angle at P. But then, the exterior angle would depend on the direction of PQ. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a transversal or some other construction. Let me think differently. Suppose we have triangle MPN, with angles at P=56°, N=45°, and M=79°. Now, there's a point Q connected to P, forming Angle(M,P,Q). If PQ is a line extending from P, then depending on where Q is, Angle(M,P,Q) could vary. 

But the problem says that ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). Assuming this is applying the exterior angle theorem, then Angle(M,P,Q) must be equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). But Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M) are both 45°, so their sum is 90°, implying that Angle(M,P,Q) is 90°. However, this contradicts the standard exterior angle theorem. Unless there's a different configuration. 

Wait, perhaps the ExteriorAngle predicate is indicating that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and the other two angles are the two adjacent interior angles. But that wouldn't make sense. Normally, an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the intended angles are different. But assuming the problem is correct, I need to work with the given information. 

Given that, even though there seems to be a conflict, perhaps I should proceed with the given data. The problem states that ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So according to this, Angle(M,P,Q) is equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). Since both are 45°, then Angle(M,P,Q) = 45 + 45 = 90°. 

But then, how does that relate to the rest? Wait, but if that's the case, then m∠MPQ is 90°, but none of the answer choices include 90°. The options are 45, 56, 79, 101. Wait, so maybe this indicates an error in my understanding. 

Wait, but the given answer choices don't include 90°, which suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to use the exterior angle theorem correctly. Let's revisit that. 

Assuming that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle to triangle MPN, then it should equal the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Those two angles would be at M and N. Which are 79° and 45°, summing to 124°. So m∠MPQ would be 124°, but this isn't among the answer choices either. Wait, the choices are A.45, B.56, C.79, D.101. None of these match. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me consider that the problem might involve a different triangle. For example, if Q is a point such that MQ is a line, forming triangle MPQ. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, the given predicates mention Line(M,P), Line(P,N), Line(M,N), which forms triangle MPN. Point Q is also present. So, perhaps Q is on line MN or elsewhere. 

Wait, the line Line(M,P) exists, and Angle(M,P,Q) is defined. So Q is a point connected to P, forming an angle at P between M and Q. So, if we consider triangle MPQ, then angle at P is ∠MPQ. Wait, but that's exactly what we're trying to find. 

Wait, if we assume that Q lies on a certain position relative to triangle MPN, perhaps the exterior angle theorem applies. For example, if Q is on the extension of PN beyond N, then ∠MPQ would be an exterior angle. Let me try to visualize:

Imagine triangle MPN, with P connected to N. Extending PN beyond N to a point Q. Then, angle at P between MP and PQ would be an exterior angle. But in this case, the exterior angle would be ∠MPQ. According to the exterior angle theorem, this should equal the sum of the remote interior angles, which are at M and N. As before, 79 + 45 = 124°. But again, this isn't among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if Q is on the extension of PM beyond M, then the angle at P would be different. But without knowing where Q is, it's challenging. 

Wait, but the problem gives us that ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So according to the problem's own predicate, Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). Since both of those are 45°, then Angle(M,P,Q) = 90°, which would make m∠MPQ = 90°, but that's not an option. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction, or perhaps a misinterpretation of the angle labels. Let me recheck the angle labels once more. 

Angle(M,N,P) is the angle at N between M and P, which is 45°. Angle(P,N,M) is the angle at N between P and M, which is the same as above, also 45°. So their sum is 90°, leading to Angle(M,P,Q)=90°. But this leads to an answer not in the choices. 

Wait, but maybe the question is not about the exterior angle of triangle MPN, but of another triangle? For example, if Q is part of another triangle. Let's suppose that Q is a point such that triangle MPQ is formed, and we're to find ∠MPQ. If we know some relations. 

But without more information about where Q is located, it's hard to determine. However, the given ExteriorAngle predicate links Angle(M,P,Q) with the other two angles. Maybe the problem assumes that Angle(M,P,Q) is an external angle to triangle MPN, and thus its measure is the sum of the other two angles. But according to that, it would be 79 + 45 = 124°, which still isn't in the options. 

Wait, but maybe the problem uses a different theorem. Like, perhaps it's not the exterior angle theorem, but something else. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the initial step. 

Let me go back to the beginning. Given angles in triangle MPN:

At P: 56°, at N: 45°, so at M: 180 - 56 - 45 = 79°. Correct. 

Now, the ExteriorAngle predicate: ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)). So, if we consider that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, then it should be equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). But these two angles are both 45°, so their sum is 90°, making Angle(M,P,Q) = 90°. 

But since this isn't an option, perhaps there's a different interpretation. What if the ExteriorAngle predicate is actually referring to the fact that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and the other two angles are adjacent interior angles? Wait, no. The exterior angle theorem states that the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different convention, like the exterior angle being supplementary to an interior angle. For example, if Angle(M,P,Q) is supplementary to the interior angle at P. So, if the interior angle at P is 56°, then the exterior angle would be 180 - 56 = 124°, which again isn't an option. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. Let me consider the possibility that I made a mistake in calculating the third angle. Let me recalculate the angles in triangle MPN. 

Given Angle at P: 56°, Angle at N: 45°, so the third angle at M is 180 - 56 - 45 = 79°. Correct. 

Then, if Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle at P, then it should be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which are at M and N: 79 + 45 = 124°, so m∠MPQ = 124°. Still not matching the choices. 

Wait, but maybe the question asks for a different angle? Let me re-read the question: "Find m∠MPQ." So it's angle at P, between M and Q. Which is Angle(M,P,Q), which we've been discussing. 

Since the answer options are A.45, B.56, C.79, D.101. None of these are 124° or 90°. This suggests that perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. 

Wait, perhaps the ExteriorAngle predicate is not referring to the exterior angle theorem, but rather a different relationship. For example, maybe it's stating that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M) are the adjacent angles? No, that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExteriorAngle predicate is indicating that Angle(M,P,Q) is supplementary to Angle(M,N,P) or something. 

Wait, let's consider that Angle(M,P,Q) and Angle(M,N,P) are supplementary. If Angle(M,N,P) is 45°, then Angle(M,P,Q) would be 180 - 45 = 135°, which is still not in the choices. 

Alternatively, if Angle(M,P,Q) is vertical to some other angle. Without knowing the diagram, it's difficult. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is not about triangle MPN, but about another triangle. For example, if Q is such that MQ is a line, forming triangle MPQ. Let me assume that. 

Suppose we have triangle MPQ, with Angle at P being ∠MPQ. We know that Angle at P in triangle MPN is 56°, but how does that relate to triangle MPQ? If Q is a point such that PQ extends from P, forming some relation. 

Alternatively, if Q is on line MN, then angle ∠MPQ would be related to other angles. But without more information, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but the problem gives us the ExteriorAngle predicate, which might indicate that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and the other two angles are parts of the triangle. If we assume that Angle(M,P,Q) is supplementary to one of the given angles. 

For example, if ∠MPQ is supplementary to the angle at P (56°), then it would be 180 - 56 = 124°, which is not in the options. 

Alternatively, if ∠MPQ is equal to the angle at M, which is 79°, that would be option C. But why? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved, but without knowing about circles, it's unclear. 

Wait, considering the answer choices, option D is 101°. How can we get 101°? Let's see. If there's a triangle where the sum of angles is 180°, and we have some angles. For example, if we have a triangle where one angle is 56°, another is 45°, and the third is 79°, but how does that relate to 101°? 

Alternatively, if we consider that ∠MPQ is an exterior angle to triangle MPN, and it equals the sum of the angles at M and N, but subtracting something. Wait, 79 + 45 = 124°, which is not helpful. 

Wait, maybe there's an error in the problem's predicates. Let me recheck the given predicates. 

The user wrote:

ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M))

Maybe this means that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M) are the two angles that are supplementary to it? Or perhaps it's a different relation. 

Alternatively, maybe the ExteriorAngle predicate is indicating that Angle(M,P,Q) is equal to Angle(M,N,P) plus Angle(P,N,M), which are both 45°, giving 90°. But again, not in the choices. 

Wait, but maybe the question is not about the exterior angle theorem, but about some other property. For example, if there's a straight line, and some angles. 

Let me think differently. Assume that the answer is one of the choices, and work backward. 

Option C is 79°, which is the angle at M in triangle MPN. Could that be the answer? Why? 

If ∠MPQ is equal to the angle at M, then it would be 79°. But why? Unless Q is positioned such that PQ is parallel to MN or something. 

Alternatively, if ∠MPQ is equal to ∠MNP, which is 45°, but that's option A. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point P. If there's a straight line at P, then the sum of angles around P would be 180°. 

Suppose that at point P, we have Angle(M,P,N) = 56°, and Angle(M,P,Q) is another angle at P. If these two angles form a linear pair, then their sum would be 180°, so ∠MPQ = 180 - 56 = 124°, which again is not an option. 

Wait, but what if Q is such that ∠MPQ is part of a different triangle? For example, if Q is on line MN, then ∠MPQ could be related. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves triangle MPQ and triangle MPN sharing side MP, and using some properties. 

Without a diagram, it's very challenging. Given the constraints, perhaps the correct answer is D. 101°, which is 180 - 79 (angle at M) - 45 (angle at N) = 56? No, that doesn't add up. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ∠MPQ is equal to ∠PNM + ∠PMN, but that would be 45 + 79 = 124°. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me review the problem again carefully. 

Given:

- Triangle MPN with angles at P: 56°, at N: 45°, so at M: 79°. 

- Point Q exists. 

- ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)): which likely means Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M), which are both 45°, so Angle(M,P,Q) = 90°. 

But since 90° is not an option, maybe the actual answer is derived from another relationship. 

Wait, perhaps the problem meant to state that Angle(M,P,Q) is an exterior angle, and the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M) is 45 + 79 = 124°, which would make Angle(M,P,Q) = 124°, but again, not in options. 

Wait, maybe the ExteriorAngle predicate is reversed? Like, the sum of the two angles is the exterior angle? For example, if the exterior angle is at Q, but that's not indicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different type of angle. For example, if Q is such that PQ is perpendicular to MN, making a right angle, but that would give 90°. 

Given the lack of clarity and the absence of 90° or 124° in the options, perhaps the correct answer is D. 101°, which is 56 + 45 = 101. Wait, 56 + 45 = 101. Oh! Wait, that's possible. 

Wait, if Angle(M,P,Q) is equal to the sum of Angle(M,P,N) and Angle(P,N,M), which are 56° and 45°, then their sum is 101°, which is option D. 

Ah! This makes sense. Perhaps the ExteriorAngle predicate is not referring to the exterior angle theorem but instead to a different relationship. If the problem says that ExteriorAngle(Angle(M,P,Q), Angle(M,N,P), Angle(P,N,M)), it might mean that Angle(M,P,Q) is equal to the sum of Angle(M,N,P) and Angle(P,N,M). 

In this case, since Angle(M,N,P) is 45°, and Angle(P,N,M) is 45°, their sum is 90°, but if instead, the intended sum is Angle(M,P,N) + Angle(P,N,M), which is 56 + 45 = 101°, then Angle(M,P,Q) = 101°, which is option D. 

This suggests that there was a mix-up in the angle labels in the ExteriorAngle predicate. Perhaps the predicate was meant to reference Angle(M,P,N) and Angle(P,N,M), which are 56° and 45°, summing to 101°, making Angle(M,P,Q) = 101°. 

This would explain why option D is present. So despite the ambiguity in the predicate's wording, if we interpret it as the sum of Angle(M,P,N) and Angle(P,N,M), then the answer is 101°, which is option D. 

Thus, the correct answer is D.
