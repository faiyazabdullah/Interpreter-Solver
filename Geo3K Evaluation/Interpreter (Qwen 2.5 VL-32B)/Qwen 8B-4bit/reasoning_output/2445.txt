Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have several points: E, A, D, C. There are lines connecting them: Line(E,A), Line(A,D), Line(E,C), Line(C,D). Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(E,A,D), Triangle(E,A,C), Triangle(C,A,D). Angles like Angle(E,A,D) and Angle(C,A,D) are given with measures 45° and 30° respectively. Additionally, there's a RightAngle at Angle(E,C,A), which means that triangle EAC is a right triangle. 

Also, some length relations: LengthOf(Line(E,A)) is 8, and it's stated that Isosceles(Triangle(E,A,D)), so triangle EAD has two equal sides. Then there's RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(A,D))) equals Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(A,D))), which suggests that EA = AD because the ratio is 1. So, since EA is 8, AD must also be 8. Wait, but then if Triangle(E,A,D) is isosceles, maybe EA and AD are the legs? But wait, in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. Since EA is given as 8, and if AD is also 8, then those are the equal sides. However, we also have angles given. Let me check the angles again.

Angle(E,A,D) is 45°, and Angle(C,A,D) is 30°. Also, Angle(E,C,A) is a right angle (90°). So triangle EAC is a right triangle with right angle at A. Given that, and knowing EA is 8, perhaps we can find AC?

Wait, the problem asks for x. But where is x defined? Hmm, maybe x refers to a certain length? Looking back at the predicates, there's a RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))) equals HalfOf(1). That would mean CD / AC = 1/2, so CD = AC / 2. But how does that fit into the rest?

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Points E, A, D, C. Lines EA, AD, EC, CD. Triangles EAD, EAC, CAD. Let's consider triangle EAD first. It's isosceles with EA=AD=8, and angle at A (EAD) is 45°, which is the vertex angle. Wait, in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Wait, if EA and AD are equal, then the base would be ED, and the base angles would be at E and D. But the given angle is at A, which would be the vertex angle. So angle at A is 45°, making the other two angles (at E and D) equal. Each of those would be (180 - 45)/2 = 67.5°. But I'm not sure yet how that helps directly.

Then there's triangle EAC, which is a right triangle with right angle at A. So angle at A is 90°, and since EA is one leg (8 units), and AC is another leg. Let's denote AC as 'b' and EC as hypotenuse. But maybe we need more info here. Also, there's a similarity relation: Similar(Triangle(E,A,D), Triangle(E,A,D))? That seems redundant unless there's a typo, but maybe it's supposed to indicate that triangle EAD is similar to another triangle? Or perhaps it's a mistake and should refer to another triangle. Maybe that's not helpful.

Another thing: the ratio of CD to AC is half. So CD = (1/2)*AC. Also, in triangle CAD, we have angle at A being 30°, as per Angle(C,A,D)=30°. Let's think about triangle CAD. We know angle at A is 30°, side AD is 8, and CD is half of AC. But how do these relate?

Wait, let's consider triangle EAC first. Since it's a right triangle at A, with EA = 8. Let's call AC = b. Then, by Pythagoras, EC² = EA² + AC² = 8² + b². But without knowing EC or another angle, maybe we need to use other information.

Looking at triangle EAD, which is isosceles with EA=AD=8, and angle at A is 45°, so maybe we can find ED using the Law of Cosines. In triangle EAD, ED² = EA² + AD² - 2*EA*AD*cos(angle at A). Plugging numbers: ED² = 8² + 8² - 2*8*8*cos(45°). Let me compute that. cos(45°) is √2/2. So:

ED² = 64 + 64 - 2*64*(√2/2) = 128 - 64√2. Therefore ED = sqrt(128 - 64√2). Not sure if that's helpful yet.

Now looking at triangle CAD. We have angle at A is 30°, AD=8, and CD=AC/2. Let's denote AC as x, so CD=x/2. Then in triangle CAD, using Law of Sines or Law of Cosines. Let me try Law of Sines. In triangle CAD:

angle at A: 30°, angle at D and C?

Wait, but we don't know the other angles. Alternatively, using Law of Cosines. Let's assume that in triangle CAD, sides AD=8, CD=x/2, and AC=x. So applying Law of Cosines on angle at A (30°):

CD² = AD² + AC² - 2*AD*AC*cos(angle at A)

So:

(x/2)² = 8² + x² - 2*8*x*cos(30°)

Compute left side: x²/4 = 64 + x² - 16x*(√3/2)

Simplify:

x²/4 = 64 + x² - 8√3 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x²/4 - x² + 8√3 x - 64 = 0 → (-3x²/4) + 8√3 x - 64 = 0

Multiply both sides by -4 to eliminate fraction:

3x² - 32√3 x + 256 = 0

This quadratic equation can be solved for x:

Discriminant D = (32√3)^2 - 4*3*256

Calculate:

(32^2)*(√3)^2 = 1024 * 3 = 3072

4*3*256 = 12*256 = 3072

Thus, D = 3072 - 3072 = 0 → one real root.

Therefore, x = [32√3]/(2*3) = (16√3)/3

But wait, this gives AC = 16√3 /3. Then CD = x/2 = 8√3 /3. But is this correct?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check if I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

In triangle CAD, angle at A is 30°, sides around angle A are AD=8 and AC=x. The side opposite angle A is CD=x/2. Wait, no: in triangle CAD, angle at A is between AD and AC. So the sides adjacent to angle A are AD and AC, and the side opposite is CD. So yes, the Law of Cosines applies as above.

So the equation was:

CD² = AD² + AC² - 2*AD*AC*cos(angle A)

Which gave us:

(x/2)^2 = 8^2 + x^2 - 2*8*x*cos(30°)

Yes, that's correct. And solving leads to x=16√3/3. But then the problem says that the ratio of CD to AC is half, which is satisfied here (CD = x/2).

However, the question is asking for x. But where is x defined? Wait, maybe x refers to AC? Because in the problem statement, the last predicate mentions RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))) equals HalfOf(1). So CD / AC = 1/2, hence CD = AC / 2. So if the question is asking for AC, then x would be AC. But the answer options don't include 16√3 /3. Let me check the answer choices again:

Options are A. 4; B. 4√2; C. 4√3; D. 8.

Hmm, none of these match 16√3 /3 ≈ 9.237. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the setup. Let me re-examine the given data.

Another thing: triangle EAC is a right triangle, with right angle at A. So EA and AC are the legs. Given EA = 8, and AC = ?

But perhaps there's another relationship involving triangle EAD and triangle EAC. For example, since triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=AD=8, angle at A is 45°, which makes it a 45-45-90 triangle? Wait, no. Wait, in an isosceles triangle with two equal sides, the angles opposite those sides are equal. So if EA=AD=8, then angles at E and D are equal. But the given angle at A is 45°, so angles at E and D are (180-45)/2 = 67.5°. So that's not a 45-45-90 triangle. Hence, the earlier calculation for ED using Law of Cosines is correct.

But then how does triangle EAC come into play? Since triangle EAC is right-angled at A, with legs EA=8 and AC. Maybe there's a connection between triangle EAD and EAC via point C?

Also, note that there's a line EC, which connects E to C. Is there a way to link EC with other parts?

Wait, maybe triangle EAC and triangle EAD share some relation? For instance, maybe triangle EAC is similar to triangle EAD? But the given predicate says Similar(Triangle(E,A,D), Triangle(E,A,D)), which is trivially true. Perhaps there's a typo and it should be comparing to another triangle, but assuming that's correct, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, considering that angle at A in EAD is 45°, and in EAC, angle at A is 90°, so maybe there's something else.

Wait, let me look again at the given ratios. The last predicate says:

RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))) equals HalfOf(1). So CD / AC = 1/2 → CD = AC / 2.

Earlier, I set up an equation based on triangle CAD leading to AC = 16√3 /3, but that doesn't match any options. So perhaps there's another approach.

Let me consider triangle EAD: isosceles with EA=AD=8, angle at A is 45°. So coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to the points.

Let me place point A at origin (0,0). Since angle at A is 45°, and EA and AD are both 8 units. Let me suppose that EA is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to E(8,0). Then AD is another side of the isosceles triangle, making a 45° angle at A. Since it's isosceles with EA=AD=8, the direction of AD would make a 45° angle with EA. So if EA is along positive x-axis, then AD would be at 45° from x-axis. Therefore, coordinates of D can be found.

Coordinates of D: starting at A(0,0), moving 8 units at 45°, so D's coordinates are (8cos45°, 8sin45°) = (8*(√2/2), 8*(√2/2)) = (4√2, 4√2).

Now, point C is such that Line(E,C) exists, and triangle EAC is right-angled at A. Since E is at (8,0), A at (0,0), then line EC would form a right angle at A. So AC is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is along x-axis from A(0,0) to E(8,0), then AC must be vertical upwards from A(0,0). Let me denote point C as (0, y), since it's along the y-axis.

So coordinates of C are (0, y). Now, triangle EAC is right-angled at A, so EC is the hypotenuse. The length of AC is y, and EA is 8.

Now, we also have triangle CAD, which includes points C(0,y), A(0,0), D(4√2,4√2). So line CD connects C(0,y) to D(4√2,4√2). The angle at A in triangle CAD is angle CAD, which is given as 30 degrees. Let's verify this.

In triangle CAD, angle at A is between CA and DA. Vector CA goes from A(0,0) to C(0,y): direction is straight up y-axis. Vector DA goes from A(0,0) to D(4√2,4√2): direction is 45° from x-axis. So the angle between CA (along y-axis) and DA (45° from x-axis) is 45° - 90° = -45°, but since angles are measured as positive, it's 45°. Wait, but the given angle is 30°, not 45°. This contradicts. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Which suggests that my coordinate assignment may be incorrect.

Ah! Here's the problem: according to the given, angle CAD is 30°, but in my current setup, it's 45°. So my assumption about the position of D must be wrong. Let me rethink the placement of D.

Since triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=AD=8 and angle at A is 45°, then the angle between EA and AD is 45°, but in my previous setup, that angle was 45°, which led to angle CAD being 45°, conflicting with the given 30°. So I must adjust the coordinates accordingly.

Let me try again. Let me fix point A at (0,0), point E at (8,0). To find coordinates of D such that AD=8 and angle EAD is 45°. So vector EA is from A to E: (8,0). Vector AD is from A to D: needs to have length 8 and form 45° with EA. Wait, the angle between EA and AD is 45°, so if EA is along x-axis, then AD is at 45° from EA. Thus, coordinates of D would be (8cosθ, 8sinθ), where θ is 45°, giving D as before. But that leads to angle CAD being 45°, which conflicts with given 30°. Therefore, there must be another configuration.

Wait, perhaps the triangle EAD is not placed with angle at A between EA and AD. Wait, angle EAD is the angle at A between points E, A, D. So vectors AE and AD meet at A, forming angle EAD. So if EA is along x-axis from A to E, then AD is some direction making 45° with EA. But then why does angle CAD become 30°?

Wait, point C is connected to A and D. How is point C located? From earlier, triangle EAC is right-angled at A, so AC is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is horizontal, AC is vertical. So point C is somewhere along the y-axis. Then angle CAD is the angle between CA (vertical) and DA (some direction). Earlier calculation said that angle between CA (y-axis) and DA (which is at 45° from x-axis) would be 45°, but the problem states angle CAD is 30°, so that suggests that DA is not at 45° from x-axis.

This implies that my initial assumption about the placement of D is wrong. Let me reconsider.

Maybe triangle EAD is not having its equal sides as EA and AD, but instead EA and ED? No, the isosceles predicate says Isosceles(Triangle(E,A,D)). In a triangle, the isosceles property means two sides are equal. The triangle has vertices E, A, D. So the equal sides could be EA=AD, EA=ED, or AD=ED. 

Given that angle at A is 45°, if EA=AD, then the triangle is isosceles with legs EA and AD, apex at A. But if EA=AD, then the base is ED, and the base angles at E and D are equal. However, if the equal sides were ED and EA, then the apex angle would be at E, but the given angle is at A. So likely, the equal sides are EA and AD, making angle at A the unique angle.

But then, how to reconcile angle CAD being 30°? Let me try to model this differently.

Let me consider triangle EAD with EA=AD=8, angle at A = 45°, so it's an isosceles triangle with two sides equal and vertex angle 45°. Using Law of Cosines, ED² = EA² + AD² - 2*EA*AD*cos(45°) = 64 + 64 - 2*64*(√2/2) = 128 - 64√2. As before.

Now, point C is such that triangle EAC is right-angled at A, so AC ⊥ AE. Since AE is along x-axis from A(0,0) to E(8,0), then AC is vertical. Let me set point C at (0, c), where c > 0.

Now, we need to find the location of point C such that angle CAD is 30°. Let me calculate the slope of AD and the slope of AC to find the angle between them.

First, coordinates of D: since EA=AD=8, and angle at A is 45°, but we need to determine coordinates of D. Let me define coordinates properly.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point E at (8,0). To find D such that AD=8 and angle EAD=45°. Let me parametrize D. Let’s say vector AD makes an angle of 45° with vector AE (which is along positive x-axis). So the coordinates of D would be (8cosθ, 8sinθ), where θ is the angle between AD and x-axis. Since angle EAD is 45°, θ is 40°? Wait, no. The angle between AE and AD is 45°, so if AE is along x-axis, then AD is at 45° from AE. So θ = 45°, making D at (8cos45°, 8sin45°) = (4√2, 4√2).

So D is at (4√2, 4√2). Now, point C is at (0,c). Now, angle CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. Vector CA is from A(0,0) to C(0,c): direction is upward y-axis. Vector DA is from A(0,0) to D(4√2,4√2): direction is 45° from x-axis. So the angle between CA (along y-axis) and DA (45° from x-axis) is 45°, since DA is at 45° from x-axis, and CA is along y-axis, which is 90° from x-axis. The angle between DA and CA is 90° - 45° = 45°. But the given angle is 30°, so this is a contradiction. Hence, my assumption that angle EAD is between EA and AD at 45° is causing conflict with angle CAD being 30°. Therefore, my earlier assumption about the configuration is wrong.

Alternative possibility: maybe the equal sides in triangle EAD are not EA and AD, but EA and ED? Let me explore that.

If triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=ED, then the equal sides are EA and ED. Given that EA is 8, so ED=8. Then, angle at A is 45°, which would be the angle between EA and AD. Wait, but if EA=ED, then the apex is at E, and the base is AD. So angle at E would be the unique angle, and the base angles at A and D would be equal. But the given angle is at A, which would be one of the base angles. So angle at A is equal to angle at D. Given that the sum of angles is 180°, angle at E is 180 - 2*angle_at_A. But the given angle at A is 45°, so angle at E would be 180 - 90 = 90°. So triangle EAD would have angles 45°, 45°, 90°, making it a right isosceles triangle. But then ED=EA=8, and AD would be the hypotenuse. Wait, no. If EA and ED are equal, and angle at E is 90°, then AD would be the hypotenuse. So AD² = EA² + ED² = 64 + 64 = 128 → AD = 8√2. But this changes things.

So if triangle EAD is right-angled at E, with EA=ED=8, then AD=8√2. Now, angle at A is 45°, as given. This would make sense. Then, where is point D located? Let me assign coordinates again.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point E at (8,0). Since triangle EAD is right-angled at E, with EA=ED=8. So point D would be at (8, 8) because from E(8,0), moving 8 units perpendicular to EA. Since EA is along x-axis, perpendicular would be along y-axis. So D would be at (8, 0 + 8) = (8,8)? Wait, no. If right angle at E, then ED is perpendicular to EA. Since EA is from E to A (from (8,0) to (0,0)), which is along negative x-axis. So ED would be perpendicular to EA, i.e., along positive y-axis from E(8,0). So D would be at (8, 0 + 8) = (8,8). Thus, coordinates of D are (8,8). Then AD is from A(0,0) to D(8,8), which has length sqrt((8)^2 + (8)^2) = 8√2, as expected.

Now, with this configuration, let's check angle CAD. Point C is part of triangle EAC, right-angled at A. So AC is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is along x-axis from A(0,0) to E(8,0), then AC is vertical, so point C is at (0, c). Now, angle CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. Vector CA is from A(0,0) to C(0,c): direction is upward y-axis. Vector DA is from A(0,0) to D(8,8): direction is along the line y=x, making 45° with x-axis. So the angle between CA (y-axis) and DA (45° from x-axis) is 45°, but the given angle is 30°, still a discrepancy. Hence, this configuration also doesn't satisfy angle CAD being 30°. What's wrong here?

Perhaps the isosceles triangle isn't EA=AD or EA=ED, but AD=ED? Let me consider that. If triangle EAD is isosceles with AD=ED, then the equal sides are AD and ED. Given that, and angle at A is 45°, which is the angle between EA and AD. Let's try this scenario.

So, in triangle EAD, sides AD=ED. Let's denote AD = ED = x. Given angle at A is 45°. Using Law of Cosines on triangle EAD: ED² = EA² + AD² - 2*EA*AD*cos(angle at A). But since AD=ED=x, substitute:

x² = EA² + x² - 2*EA*x*cos(45°)

Simplify: 0 = EA² - 2*EA*x*cos(45°)

Rearranged: 2*EA*x*cos(45°) = EA² → x = EA / (2*cos(45°)) = 8 / (2*(√2/2)) = 8 / √2 = 4√2.

So AD = ED = 4√2. Then, EA is 8. Now, let's find coordinates. Place A at (0,0), E at (8,0). Need to find D such that AD=4√2 and ED=4√2.

So D is a point such that distance from A(0,0) to D is 4√2, and distance from E(8,0) to D is also 4√2. So D lies at intersection of two circles: centered at A with radius 4√2, and centered at E with radius 4√2.

Equations: x² + y² = (4√2)^2 = 32, and (x-8)^2 + y² = 32.

Subtracting first equation from second: (x-8)^2 + y² - x² - y² = 32 - 32 → expand (x² -16x +64) - x² = 0 → -16x +64 = 0 → x = 4.

Substitute x=4 into first equation: 4² + y² = 32 → 16 + y² = 32 → y²=16 → y=±4. So D is at (4,4) or (4,-4). Assuming standard orientation, take D(4,4).

Now, angle at A is between EA (from A(0,0) to E(8,0)) and AD (from A(0,0) to D(4,4)). The angle between these vectors can be calculated. The vectors are EA: (8,0) and AD: (4,4). The angle between them is calculated using dot product:

cos(theta) = (EA · AD) / (|EA| |AD|) = (8*4 + 0*4)/(8 * 4√2) = 32/(32√2) = 1/√2 → theta = 45°, which matches the given condition. Great!

Now, with D at (4,4), let's analyze angle CAD. Point C is part of right triangle EAC, right-angled at A. So AC is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is along x-axis, AC is vertical. Let C be at (0, c). Now, angle CAD is the angle at A between CA (from A to C) and DA (from A to D). Vector CA is (0, c) - (0,0) = (0,c). Vector DA is (4,4) - (0,0) = (4,4). The angle between CA and DA is angle CAD.

To find this angle, we can use the dot product again. The cosine of angle CAD is (CA · DA) / (|CA| |DA|).

CA · DA = (0)(4) + (c)(4) = 4c.

|CA| = sqrt(0² + c²) = |c|.

|DA| = sqrt(4² +4²) = sqrt(32) = 4√2.

So cos(angle CAD) = 4c / (|c| * 4√2) = sign(c)/√2. Since c is positive (assuming C is above x-axis), this becomes 1/√2, implying angle is 45°, but the given angle is 30°. Again, contradiction. What's wrong here?

Wait, this suggests that regardless of where C is placed on the y-axis, the angle CAD remains 45°, which conflicts with the given 30°. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. Where is the mistake?

Perhaps the issue is that the right angle in triangle EAC is not at A? Wait, the predicate says Right(Triangle(E,A,C)), which means the triangle is right-angled. But where is the right angle? The predicate specifies it as RightAngle(Angle(E,C,A)), which is angle at A. So it is right-angled at A. So AC is perpendicular to AE, as previously assumed.

But then angle CAD remains 45°, conflicting with given 30°. This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation of the given data.

Let me revisit the given predicates. One of the predicates is Right(Triangle(E,A,C)), which means it's a right triangle, and Angle(E,C,A) is the right angle. Another predicate is Angle(E,C,A) is a right angle. So yes, the right angle is at A. 

But in our current setup, with D at (4,4), angle CAD is 45°, but the problem states it's 30°. So this suggests that either the configuration is different, or there's a missing piece.

Wait, what about the line CD? The predicate says Line(C,D) exists, and in triangle CAD, which includes points C, A, D. Also, there's a ratio of CD to AC is 1/2. Let me try to use this.

From earlier, in this configuration, with D at (4,4), C at (0,c), then CD is the distance between (0,c) and (4,4). Let's compute CD:

CD² = (4-0)^2 + (4-c)^2 = 16 + (4 - c)^2.

AC is the length from A(0,0) to C(0,c), which is |c|.

Given that CD / AC = 1/2 → CD = AC / 2 → CD² = (AC²)/4.

So:

16 + (4 - c)^2 = (c²)/4.

Multiply both sides by 4:

64 + 4(4 - c)^2 = c².

Expand 4(4 - c)^2: 4*(16 - 8c + c²) = 64 - 32c + 4c².

So:

64 + 64 - 32c + 4c² = c² → 128 -32c +4c² = c² → 128 -32c +3c² = 0.

Divide by 1: 3c² -32c +128 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation:

Discriminant D = (32)^2 - 4*3*128 = 1024 - 1536 = -512 < 0. No real solutions. This is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, indicating that the assumption about the position of D is incorrect.

This suggests that my entire approach is flawed. Let me try a different method, focusing on the given angles and ratios.

Given:
- Triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=AD=8, angle at A is 45°.
- Triangle EAC is right-angled at A, with EA=8.
- Angle at CAD is 30°.
- CD = AC / 2.

Let me focus on triangle CAD. In triangle CAD, we know angle at A is 30°, AD=8, and CD = AC/2. Let's denote AC as x, so CD = x/2.

Using the Law of Sines on triangle CAD: sin(angle at C)/AD = sin(angle at A)/CD.

But I need to identify the angles. Let's denote:

In triangle CAD:
- angle at A: 30°
- side opposite angle at A: CD = x/2
- side AD = 8, opposite angle at C
- side AC = x, opposite angle at D

So applying Law of Sines:

CD / sin(angle at C) = AD / sin(angle at D) = AC / sin(angle at A)

But angle at A is 30°, so:

CD / sin(angle at C) = AC / sin(30°)

=> (x/2) / sin(angle at C) = x / (1/2) → (x/2) / sin(angle at C) = 2x → Divide both sides by x: (1/2)/sin(angle at C) = 2 → sin(angle at C) = 1/4.

Similarly, angle at C is arcsin(1/4). Let's call this angle γ.

Sum of angles in triangle CAD is 180°: angle at A (30°) + angle at C (γ) + angle at D (δ) = 180°.

So δ = 180° - 30° - γ = 150° - γ.

Now, using Law of Sines again on AD / sin(angle at D) = AC / sin(30°):

AD / sin(δ) = AC / (1/2) → 8 / sin(150° - γ) = x / (1/2) → 8 / sin(150° - γ) = 2x → x = 4 / sin(150° - γ).

But we also have from earlier that sin(γ) = 1/4, so γ = arcsin(1/4). Let me calculate sin(150° - γ).

Using sine subtraction formula: sin(150° - γ) = sin(150°)cosγ - cos(150°)sinγ.

We know sin(150°) = 1/2, cos(150°) = -√3/2.

So:

sin(150° - γ) = (1/2)cosγ - (-√3/2)sinγ = (1/2)cosγ + (√3/2)sinγ.

We know sinγ = 1/4. To find cosγ, use cos²γ = 1 - sin²γ = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 → cosγ = √15/4 (since γ is acute, as it's an angle in a triangle).

So:

sin(150° - γ) = (1/2)(√15/4) + (√3/2)(1/4) = (√15)/8 + √3/8 = (√15 + √3)/8.

Thus, x = 4 / [(√15 + √3)/8] = 4 * 8 / (√15 + √3) = 32 / (√15 + √3).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√15 - √3):

32(√15 - √3) / [(√15 + √3)(√15 - √3)] = 32(√15 - √3) / (15 - 3) = 32(√15 - √3)/12 = 8(√15 - √3)/3.

This expression doesn't match any of the answer choices either. This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the setup.

At this point, I realize that my approach might be too convoluted. Let me try to use the given ratios and angles to find relationships between the sides.

Given that triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=AD=8 and angle at A=45°, so it's a 45-45-90 triangle? Wait, no, because if it's isosceles with two equal sides and vertex angle 45°, it's not a right triangle. Wait, but if it were a right isosceles triangle, the angles would be 45-45-90. But here, the angle at A is 45°, and it's isosceles, so if it were right-angled, then the other two angles would be 45°, making it a right isosceles triangle. But in this case, the given angle is 45°, and it's isosceles, so it could be a right isosceles triangle. But earlier calculations suggested otherwise. Let me check this.

If triangle EAD is a right isosceles triangle with right angle at A, then angles at E and D would be 45°, and EA=AD. But the given angle at A is 45°, which would imply it's not a right triangle. Hence, contradiction. So this suggests that the triangle is not right-angled.

Given all these contradictions, perhaps the key is to use the fact that CD = AC/2 and apply trigonometry in triangle CAD with angle 30°, and combine it with other information.

Let me consider triangle CAD with angle at A = 30°, AD = 8, CD = AC/2. Let me denote AC = x, so CD = x/2. Applying the Law of Cosines in triangle CAD:

CD² = AD² + AC² - 2*AD*AC*cos(30°)

(x/2)² = 8² + x² - 2*8*x*(√3/2)

Simplify:

x²/4 = 64 + x² - 8√3 x

Multiply all terms by 4:

x² = 256 + 4x² - 32√3 x

Bring all terms to left:

x² - 4x² + 32√3 x - 256 = 0 → -3x² + 32√3 x - 256 = 0 → 3x² - 32√3 x + 256 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation for x:

Discriminant D = (32√3)^2 - 4*3*256 = 3072 - 3072 = 0.

So x = (32√3) / (2*3) = 16√3 / 3.

So AC = 16√3 / 3. But this doesn't match any of the answer choices. However, the answer choices include 4√3, which is approximately 6.928, while 16√3/3 is approximately 9.237. None of the options match this, suggesting that perhaps the question asks for a different quantity, or there's an error in interpretation.

Wait, the question asks for x, but where is x defined? The problem statement doesn't explicitly define x, but the answer choices suggest it's a length. Given that, perhaps x refers to CD or AC. Let me check the last predicate: RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))) equals HalfOf(1). So CD / AC = 1/2 → CD = AC/2. If x is AC, then AC = 16√3/3, which is not an option. If x is CD, then x = AC/2 = 8√3/3, also not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps x is ED? Or another segment? Let me review the predicates again.

The predicates mention various lines: Line(E,A), Line(A,D), Line(E,C), Line(C,D). The question asks for x, but it's not specified. However, in many problems, x often represents a particular length, possibly ED or CD or AC. Given the answer choices, let's see if any of them relate to the calculated values.

For example, if x is ED, in the earlier scenario where triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=AD=8, then ED would be computed using Law of Cosines as sqrt(128 - 64√2), which is not among the options. If x is AC, it's 16√3/3, not matching. If x is CD, it's 8√3/3, also not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which sides are equal in the isosceles triangle. Let me revisit the isosceles predicate: Isosceles(Triangle(E,A,D)). This means two sides are equal. The sides could be EA and ED, or EA and AD, or AD and ED.

Previously, I considered EA=AD=8, but if instead, it's EA=ED, then ED=8, and AD can be calculated.

Let me try this. Assume triangle EAD is isosceles with EA=ED=8. Then, using Law of Cosines to find AD:

AD² = EA² + ED² - 2*EA*ED*cos(angle at E).

But angle at E is not given. Alternatively, if the equal sides are EA and ED, then the base is AD, and the base angles at A and D are equal. Given that angle at A is 45°, then angle at D is also 45°, making angle at E = 180 - 45 - 45 = 90°. So triangle EAD is a right isosceles triangle with right angle at E. This would mean ED=EA=8, and AD=8√2.

With this configuration, let's proceed. Let me place point E at (0,0), A at (8,0), and since it's a right isosceles triangle at E, point D would be at (0,8). So coordinates: E(0,0), A(8,0), D(0,8). Now, angle at A is between EA and AD. Vector EA is from A(8,0) to E(0,0): (-8,0). Vector AD is from A(8,0) to D(0,8): (-8,8). The angle between these vectors is calculated as follows:

Dot product: (-8)(-8) + (0)(8) = 64.

Magnitude of EA: 8.

Magnitude of AD: sqrt((-8)^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(128) = 8√2.

Cosine of angle: 64 / (8 * 8√2) = 1/√2 → angle is 45°, which matches the given condition. Good.

Now, point C is such that triangle EAC is right-angled at A. Since A is at (8,0), and EA is from A to E(0,0), then AC must be perpendicular to EA. Since EA is along the x-axis from A to E, AC is vertical. Let me place point C at (8, c), since it's perpendicular to EA (which is horizontal). Wait, no: if AC is perpendicular to EA, and EA is from A to E (left along x-axis), then AC would be vertical upwards from A. So point C would be at (8, c). Let's say C is at (8, c).

Now, angle CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. Vector CA is from A(8,0) to C(8,c): (0, c). Vector DA is from A(8,0) to D(0,8): (-8,8). Let's compute this angle.

Vector CA: (0, c) - (8,0) = (0 - 8, c - 0) = (-8, c)? Wait, no: vector from A to C is (8, c) - (8,0) = (0, c). Vector DA is D - A = (0,8) - (8,0) = (-8,8). So the angle between vector CA (0, c) and DA (-8,8) at point A.

To find this angle, use the dot product:

cos(theta) = (CA · DA) / (|CA| |DA|).

CA · DA = (0)(-8) + (c)(8) = 8c.

|CA| = sqrt(0² + c²) = |c|.

|DA| = sqrt((-8)^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(128) = 8√2.

So cos(theta) = 8c / (|c| * 8√2) = sign(c)/√2. Assuming c > 0, this is 1/√2 → theta = 45°, but the given angle is 30°. Still discrepancy. 

But the problem states that angle CAD is 3
