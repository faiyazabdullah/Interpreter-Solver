Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a circle F with diameter AC. Points A, B, C, D are all on the circle since they're inscribed in circle F. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,C) is the diameter, so that's straightforward. Then there are other lines like AB, BC, CD, DA, AF, BF, CF, DF. Also, some angles are given: Angle(BFD) is 72 degrees, Angle(AFD) is 4a -1, and Angle(AFB) is 2a -5. We need to find the measure of angle AFB.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since AC is the diameter, any angle subtended by AC on the circumference should be a right angle. Wait, but points B and D are also on the circle. Let me think about the angles given. 

They mention that Angle(BFD) is a central angle because it's stated that IsCentralAngle(Angle(B,F,D), Circle(F)). Central angles correspond to arcs equal to their measure. Also, since AC is the diameter, the arc AC would be 180 degrees. But how does that relate to the other angles?

Then there's Angle(AFD) which is an inscribed angle? Wait, the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,D), Circle(F))? Wait, no—wait, looking back at the predicates: IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)) is mentioned twice. Wait, maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the given predicates include:

IsCentralAngle(Angle(B,F,D), Circle(F)) — so angle BFD is a central angle. Therefore, its measure equals the measure of arc BD. Because central angles correspond directly to the arc measure. 

Similarly, Angle(AFD) is also a central angle? Wait, the predicate says IsCentralAngle(Angle(A,F,D), Circle(F)). So angle AFD is a central angle. Therefore, its measure is equal to the arc AD. Similarly, Angle(AFB) is an inscribed angle? Wait, the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)). So angle AFB is an inscribed angle. Therefore, its measure is half the measure of the arc it subtends. 

But first, let's note down all given angle measures. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,D)) = 72°. Since it's a central angle, arc BD measures 72°. 

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 4a -1. Since it's a central angle (from the predicate), this angle corresponds to arc AD. Therefore, arc AD measures 4a -1 degrees. 

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) = 2a -5. This is an inscribed angle. Wait, the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)), so angle AFB is an inscribed angle. Therefore, it subtends an arc. Which arc? Inscribed angles subtend the arc opposite to them. So angle AFB subtends arc AB. Therefore, the measure of angle AFB is half the measure of arc AB. 

So, angle AFB = (arc AB)/2. Therefore, 2a -5 = (arc AB)/2 → arc AB = 4a -10. 

Now, let's consider the entire circle. The total circumference is 360 degrees. The arcs we know so far are arc BD = 72°, arc AD = 4a -1°, and arc AB = 4a -10°. Wait, but we need to figure out how these arcs connect. 

Since AC is the diameter, arc AC is 180°. Let's see, points A, B, C, D are on the circle. Let me imagine the circle with diameter AC. Let me think about the order of the points. Since there are lines connecting A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A, forming a quadrilateral ABCD. Wait, but since AC is a diameter, and points B and D are also on the circle. 

Alternatively, perhaps ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral with AC as diameter. However, without knowing the exact positions, maybe we need to use the arcs. 

Let me consider that the circle has arcs AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but if AC is the diameter, then moving from A to C along the circumference would cover half the circle. Let me think about how the arcs add up. 

Arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°, but since AC is a diameter, arc AC is 180°, which would be arc AB + arc BC or arc AD + arc DC depending on the direction. Wait, maybe I need to consider the arcs between the points. 

Alternatively, considering that angle AFD is a central angle corresponding to arc AD. So arc AD = measure of angle AFD = 4a -1. Similarly, angle BFD is a central angle, so arc BD = 72°. 

Also, angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. 

Additionally, since AC is the diameter, arc AC is 180°, so the sum of arcs AB + BC = 180°, assuming points B and C are arranged such that moving from A to C via B. Alternatively, maybe points are arranged differently. 

But perhaps there's another way. Let's consider that angle AFD is a central angle over arc AD, so arc AD = 4a -1. Similarly, angle BFD is a central angle over arc BD = 72°. 

What's the relationship between arcs AD and BD? Well, if we consider point D connected to A and C, and point B connected to A and C. Maybe the arcs can be combined. 

Alternatively, since AC is a diameter, points B and D could be positioned symmetrically? Not sure yet. 

Another thought: since ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle, the sum of opposite angles is 180°, but wait, those are inscribed angles. However, here we have central angles and inscribed angles. Maybe that's not directly applicable. 

Alternatively, since AC is the diameter, then angles ABC and ADC would be right angles if they were inscribed angles subtended by the diameter. Wait, but points B and D are on the circle. For example, angle ABC would be an inscribed angle subtended by AC, so it would be 90°, but I'm not sure if that applies here. 

Wait, but in our case, points B and D are connected to A and C. Let me think again. 

We have arc AD = 4a -1°, arc BD = 72°, and angle AFB = 2a -5°, which is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. 

Let me try to express all arcs in terms of variables. Let me denote:

arc AB = x

arc BC = y

arc CD = z

arc DA = w

But since AC is the diameter, arc AC is 180°, which would be arc AB + arc BC = x + y = 180°, assuming points are ordered A, B, C around the circle. Or if points are ordered A, D, C, then arc AD + arc DC = w + z = 180°. Hmm, depends on where D is located. 

But we also have arc AD = w = 4a -1°, as per angle AFD being a central angle. And arc BD = 72°, which is the arc from B to D passing through the side not containing A and C? Wait, arc BD could be part of the circle. 

Alternatively, since angle BFD is a central angle, which means that arc BD is 72°, so the measure of arc BD is 72°. 

So, if we can find relations between arcs AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD. 

But BD is an arc that connects B to D. Depending on the position of D relative to B. Suppose the points are arranged as A, B, C, D around the circle. Wait, but AC is the diameter. Let me try to visualize. 

Assume the circle with diameter AC. Let me place point A on the left, C on the right. Now, points B and D are somewhere on the circumference. 

If we consider angle AFD (central angle), which is formed by points A, F, D. Since F is the center of the circle. Wait, hold on! Wait, the circle is called Circle(F). So F is the center. Oh! That’s crucial. All the lines from F to points A, B, C, D are radii. 

Therefore, F is the center of the circle. So, lines FA, FB, FC, FD are all radii. 

So, angle BFD is a central angle, which is formed by two radii FB and FD. Therefore, the measure of angle BFD is equal to the measure of arc BD. Which is given as 72°, so arc BD = 72°. 

Similarly, angle AFD is a central angle, so angle AFD is formed by radii FA and FD. Therefore, measure of angle AFD equals arc AD. Given as 4a -1. 

Angle AFB is an inscribed angle. Wait, no—the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)). Wait, inscribed angle requires that the vertex lies on the circle. But here, the angle is at point F, which is the center. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. 

Wait, the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)). But inscribed angle has its vertex on the circle. Here, the angle is at point F, which is the center. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe there was a typo. Let me recheck the original problem statement. 

Original predicates: 

IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)) appears twice. But angle AFB is at point F, which is the center. So that can't be an inscribed angle. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be an inscribed angle. Wait, unless the angle is actually referring to something else. 

Hold on, this seems conflicting. Let me double-check. 

The user wrote:

"IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F))"
and 
"IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F))"

But angle AFB is formed by points A-F-B. Since F is the center, the angle at F is a central angle, not an inscribed one. So this seems contradictory. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I misread the predicates. 

Wait, maybe the angle isn't at F? Let me check the original problem again. 

The question asks for the measure of ∠AFB on ⊙F. So ∠AFB is the angle at point F, between points A and B. Since F is the center, that's a central angle. But according to the given predicates, it's labeled as an inscribed angle. That seems conflicting. 

This suggests there may be an error in the problem setup, but assuming that the given predicates are correct, perhaps I need to reinterpret. 

Wait, maybe there's confusion between central angles and inscribed angles. Let me think again. 

An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex is on the circle, while a central angle has its vertex at the center. So if the predicate says IsInscribedAngle(Angle(A,F,B), Circle(F)), then that implies that the vertex of the angle is on the circle. But here, the vertex is F, which is the center. That's impossible. Hence, there's likely a mistake in the problem's predicates. 

Wait, maybe the angle is meant to be ∠ABF instead of ∠AFB? Or perhaps a different configuration. Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point B? Let me check the original problem again. 

The question is asking for the measure of ∠AFB, which is at point F. So the angle is at F, making it a central angle. But the predicate says it's an inscribed angle. That's conflicting. Unless the problem has a typo. 

But since we have to work with the given predicates, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the angle is not ∠AFB but ∠ABF? Or maybe the problem uses a different definition. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is considered as an inscribed angle even though it's at the center. That would be incorrect, but maybe the problem intended something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending an arc. Wait, but if F is the center, then any angle at F is a central angle. 

Hmm, this seems like a contradiction. Let me proceed carefully. 

Assuming that despite the predicate saying it's an inscribed angle, it's actually a central angle. Because the angle is at the center. So maybe there's an error in the predicate, but we need to proceed with the math. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at F. Let me check the given lines. 

Lines mentioned are Line(A,F), Line(B,F), Line(C,F), Line(D,F). So F is connected to all four points. So angle AFB is indeed at F. 

So given that, angle AFB is a central angle. Then why is the predicate saying it's an inscribed angle? This seems inconsistent. But since we have to go with the given predicates, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not AFB but another angle. Let me check the given angles. 

The given angles are:

Angle(B,F,D): 72°, which is at F, so central angle.

Angle(A,F,D): 4a -1°, central angle.

Angle(A,F,B): 2a -5°, which is also a central angle. 

But the predicate says it's an inscribed angle. This inconsistency needs to be addressed. 

Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angle is supposed to be an inscribed angle at point B. For instance, angle ABD or something. But given the current setup, I'll have to work with what's given. 

Assuming that the angle AFB is a central angle, even though the predicate says inscribed. Let me proceed under that assumption, since otherwise the problem is inconsistent. 

So, proceeding with angle AFB being a central angle. Thus, its measure is equal to the arc AB. 

So, if angle AFB is a central angle, then measure(angle AFB) = arc AB. 

But earlier, we had angle AFD (at F) is a central angle measuring 4a -1°, which equals arc AD. 

And angle BFD (at F) is 72°, which equals arc BD. 

Now, we can try to relate these arcs. 

Since AC is the diameter, arc AC is 180°. Let's assume that points are arranged in the order A, B, C, D around the circle. Then, arc AB + arc BC = 180°, and arc AD + arc DC = 180°. But we also have arc BD = 72°. 

Let me draw this mentally. Starting at A, going counterclockwise: A -> B -> C -> D -> A. 

Then arc AB + arc BC = 180°, arc AD = arc AB + arc BC + arc CD? No, arc AD would depend on the path. Wait, if we go from A to D, it could be arc AD directly, which is 4a -1°, as given. 

Alternatively, arc AD could be composed of arc AB + arc BC + arc CD, but that would be longer than 180°, which is not possible. So perhaps arc AD is the shorter arc between A and D. 

Alternatively, the arc AD is 4a -1°, and arc BD is 72°, which is the arc from B to D. 

To relate these arcs, let's consider the total circle. 

Total circumference is 360°, so the sum of all arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360°. 

But we also know that arc AC (the diameter) is 180°, which is the sum of arcs AB + BC = 180°, assuming points are placed in order A-B-C on one semicircle. 

So, arc AB + arc BC = 180°. 

Also, arc AD = 4a -1°, which is the arc from A to D. Depending on the position of D, this arc could be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD if D is on the other side, but that would exceed 180°. Alternatively, arc AD could be the minor arc AD, which is directly from A to D. 

Similarly, arc BD = 72°, which is from B to D. 

Let me try to express arc BD in terms of other arcs. 

If arc AB = x, arc BC = y, arc CD = z, arc DA = w. 

From above, x + y = 180°. 

Also, arc AD = w = 4a -1. 

Arc BD is the arc from B to D. Assuming the points are arranged A-B-C-D-A, then arc BD would pass through C, so arc BD = arc BC + arc CD = y + z. 

Thus, y + z = 72°. 

Also, since the total circumference is 360°, we have x + y + z + w = 360°. Substituting x + y = 180°, and w = 4a -1, and y + z = 72°, then:

x + y + z + w = (x + y) + z + w = 180° + z + w = 360°. 

But since y + z = 72°, z = 72° - y. 

Substitute z into the equation:

180° + (72° - y) + w = 360° → 180° + 72° - y + w = 360 → 252° - y + w = 360 → -y + w = 108° → w = y + 108°. 

But we also know that w = 4a -1. 

So, 4a -1 = y + 108 → y = 4a -1 - 108 = 4a -109. 

Now, from earlier, x + y = 180°, so x = 180° - y = 180° - (4a -109) = 180° -4a + 109 = 289 -4a. 

But x represents arc AB. Also, we have angle AFB, which we initially thought was a central angle, so its measure is arc AB. But earlier, we had that angle AFB is given as 2a -5°, which is supposed to be an inscribed angle. But if it's a central angle, then 2a -5 = arc AB. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that angle AFB is an inscribed angle, leading to arc AB = 2*(measure of angle AFB). But if it's a central angle, then measure of angle AFB equals arc AB. 

So, if angle AFB is a central angle, then:

measure(angle AFB) = arc AB = 2a -5. 

But from earlier, arc AB = x = 289 -4a. 

So setting these equal:

289 -4a = 2a -5 → 289 +5 = 6a → 294 = 6a → a = 294 / 6 = 49. 

Then, substituting back, a=49. 

Now, let's verify consistency. 

Compute arc AB = 2a -5 = 2*49 -5 = 98 -5 = 93°. 

Also, arc AB = x = 289 -4a = 289 -4*49 = 289 - 196 = 93°. Consistent. 

Now, arc AD = w = 4a -1 = 4*49 -1 = 196 -1 = 195°. 

But arc AD = 195°, which is more than 180°, implying that it's the major arc AD. But earlier, we assumed that arc AD is the minor arc. However, if arc AD is 195°, then the minor arc AD would be 360 -195 = 165°, but this contradicts the previous assumption. 

Wait, this suggests that my initial assumption about the arrangement of points might be wrong. If arc AD is 195°, then the minor arc AD is 165°, but earlier, we said that arc AD = 4a -1 = 195°, which is the major arc. 

But in the problem, angle AFD is a central angle, which would correspond to arc AD. If the arc AD is 195°, then angle AFD is 195°, which is possible. 

However, this leads us to arc BD = y + z = 72°, where y = arc BC = 4a -109 = 4*49 -109 = 196 -109 = 87°, and z = 72 - y = 72 -87 = -15°, which is impossible. 

Negative arc length? That can't be. So there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that my earlier assumption about the arrangement of points is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: Maybe arc AD is the minor arc, so it's 4a -1°, which should be less than 180°. 

So, if arc AD = 4a -1 < 180°, then 4a -1 < 180 → 4a < 181 → a < 45.25. 

Earlier, we found a = 49, which violates this condition. So that's invalid. 

Hence, there's a contradiction. This suggests that my initial assumption about the relation between arcs BD and y+z is wrong. 

Maybe the arc BD is not y + z, but something else. Let me reconsider the positioning of points. 

Suppose the points are arranged as A, D, B, C around the circle. So the order is A -> D -> B -> C -> A. In this case, arc BD would be arc from B to D passing through the other side, which might be arc BA + arc AD. 

Alternatively, let me think again about the arc BD. 

If the points are arranged as A, D, C, B around the circle, then arc BD would pass through C. 

But this is getting too vague without a diagram. Let me try a different method. 

Since angle AFD is a central angle (at F), so it measures arc AD = 4a -1. 

Similarly, angle BFD is a central angle, so it measures arc BD = 72°. 

Also, angle AFB is a central angle (assuming the predicate is incorrect), so it measures arc AB = 2a -5. 

Now, since AC is the diameter, arc AC = 180°. 

Let me consider that arc AB + arc BC = 180°, as AC is the diameter. 

Also, arc AD = 4a -1, and arc BD = 72°. 

Let me try to express arc AD and arc BD in terms of other arcs. 

If we consider arc AD, it could be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD if D is on the opposite side, but that would be larger than 180°. 

Alternatively, if D is near A, arc AD is small. 

But with arc BD = 72°, let's suppose that arc BD is made up of arc BC + arc CD or arc BA + arc AD, depending on the position. 

Let me consider that arc BD = arc BC + arc CD = 72°. 

Also, arc AD = arc AB + arc BC + arc CD? No, that would be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD = arc AB + arc BD = arc AB + 72°. 

But arc AD = 4a -1. 

So, arc AB + 72° = 4a -1 → arc AB = 4a -1 -72 = 4a -73. 

But arc AB is also equal to angle AFB, which is 2a -5 (if it's a central angle). 

So, 4a -73 = 2a -5 → 2a = 68 → a = 34. 

Let's test this. 

a = 34. 

Then, arc AB = 2a -5 = 68 -5 = 63°. 

Also, arc AD = 4a -1 = 4*34 -1 = 136 -1 = 135°. 

Then, arc BD = 72°, which is arc BC + arc CD = 72°. 

Also, since arc AB + arc BC = 180°, arc BC = 180 - arc AB = 180 -63 = 117°. 

So, arc BC = 117°, arc CD = 72 - arc BC = 72 -117 = -45°. Again negative. Impossible. 

Hmm, same issue. 

Alternative approach: Assume that arc BD is arc BA + arc AD. 

So, arc BD = arc BA + arc AD = arc AB + arc AD = 72°. 

We have arc AB = 2a -5 (if central angle), arc AD = 4a -1. 

So, (2a -5) + (4a -1) = 72 → 6a -6 = 72 → 6a = 78 → a = 13. 

Then, arc AB = 2*13 -5 = 26 -5 = 21°, arc AD = 4*13 -1 = 52 -1 = 51°. 

Then, arc BD = 21 +51 = 72°, which matches. 

Now, let's check other arcs. 

Since arc AB + arc BC = 180°, arc BC = 180 - arc AB = 180 -21 = 159°. 

Also, arc AD = 51°, which is from A to D. 

What about arc CD? If points are arranged as A, B, C, D, then arc CD would be part of the remaining arc. 

Total circumference is 360°. Sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360. 

We have arc AB = 21°, arc BC = 159°, arc DA = 51°. 

So, arc CD = 360 - (21 +159 +51) = 360 - 231 = 129°. 

Now, arc BD = 72°, which we already used. 

Now, what about other parts? 

But let's check if this fits with the rest. 

Also, we have arc AD = 51°, arc AB = 21°, arc BC = 159°, arc CD = 129°. 

Does this make sense? Yes. 

Now, let's check if there are any other constraints. 

But we also have angle AFD = 4a -1 = 4*13 -1 = 51°, which is equal to arc AD, which matches. 

So this seems consistent. 

Now, the question is to find measure of angle AFB, which is 2a -5 = 2*13 -5 = 26 -5 = 21°. 

But wait, the options are A. 72, B. 108, C. 120, D. 144. 21° is not among them. 

This suggests that either my assumption about angle AFB being a central angle is wrong, or there's another error. 

Wait, but the given angle AFB is supposed to be an inscribed angle, according to the predicate. So if it's an inscribed angle, then its measure is half the arc it subtends. 

So, if angle AFB is an inscribed angle, then it subtends arc AB. Wait, but inscribed angle subtends the arc opposite to it. So if the angle is at F, which is the center, then it's a central angle, not inscribed. 

This brings us back to the contradiction. 

But if we assume that angle AFB is an inscribed angle, then it must have its vertex on the circle. So, perhaps the angle is at point B? Like angle ABD? But the problem states it's ∠AFB. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to think differently. 

Assuming that angle AFB is an inscribed angle, which would mean that it subtends an arc. But since F is the center, this is impossible. So, there must be a mistake in the problem's predicates. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at F, but at B? Let me check the given lines: Line(A,B), Line(B,F), Line(C,F), etc. So, angle at B between A and F. That would be ∠ABF. 

If that's the case, then ∠ABF is an inscribed angle, subtending arc AF. Wait, but AF is a radius, so it's not an arc. Wait, the inscribed angle would subtend an arc. 

For example, if angle is at B, then it would subtend arc AF. 

But this is speculative. Given the confusion, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angle is meant to be ∠ABF. 

Alternatively, if we take the given that angle AFB is an inscribed angle, even though it's at F, which is the center, then its measure would be half the arc it subtends. But since it's at the center, it's a central angle, so this is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is meant to be ∠ABF, which is an inscribed angle. Let me explore this possibility. 

Assume that the angle in question is ∠ABF, not ∠AFB. Then, it would be an inscribed angle subtending arc AF. But AF is a radius, so the arc AF would be 180° divided by... Wait, arc AF is from A to F? No, F is the center. Arcs are between points on the circle. 

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps I need to revisit the initial equations with the assumption that angle AFB is a central angle, and the given predicate about it being an inscribed angle is incorrect. 

In that case, with a = 13, angle AFB = 21°, which is not in the options. So this is invalid. 

Alternatively, if angle AFB is an inscribed angle, then it would be half the measure of the arc it subtends. Let's say it subtends arc AC. But arc AC is 180°, so the angle would be 90°. Not matching. 

Or, if it subtends arc BD, which is 72°, then the angle would be 36°. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if it subtends arc AD, which is 51°, then the angle would be 25.5°, not matching. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem setup. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the angle AFB is an inscribed angle, and therefore, it subtends arc AB. So, measure of angle AFB = ½ * arc AB. 

Previously, we had arc AB = 2a -5 (if it's a central angle), but if it's an inscribed angle, then 2a -5 = ½ * arc AB → arc AB = 4a -10. 

Earlier, we had arc BD = 72°, arc AD = 4a -1, and arc AB = 4a -10. 

Let me try this new approach. 

Assume angle AFB is an inscribed angle, so it subtends arc AB. Therefore, measure(angle AFB) = ½ * arc AB → 2a -5 = ½ * arc AB → arc AB = 4a -10. 

Now, arc AD = 4a -1. 

Also, arc BD = 72°. 

Let me relate these. 

Assuming points are arranged such that arc BD = arc BC + arc CD = 72°. 

Also, arc AB = 4a -10. 

Since AC is the diameter, arc AB + arc BC = 180° → arc BC = 180 - (4a -10) = 190 -4a. 

Then, arc CD = arc BD - arc BC = 72 - (190 -4a) = 4a -118. 

Now, total circumference: arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°. 

Substitute:

(4a -10) + (190 -4a) + (4a -118) + (4a -1) = ?

Calculate term by term:

4a -10 + 190 -4a = 180

Then add 4a -118: 180 + 4a -118 = 4a + 62

Add 4a -1: 4a +62 +4a -1 = 8a +61

Set equal to 360°:

8a +61 = 360 → 8a = 299 → a = 299/8 = 37.375. 

Now, compute arc AB = 4a -10 = 4*(37.375) -10 = 149.5 -10 = 139.5°. 

Then, arc AD = 4a -1 = 4*37.375 -1 = 149.5 -1 = 148.5°. 

Check if this makes sense. 

But arc AD = 148.5°, which is greater than 180°, suggesting it's the major arc. 

Now, let's check other arcs. 

arc BC = 190 -4a = 190 -4*37.375 = 190 -149.5 = 40.5°. 

arc CD = 4a -118 = 149.5 -118 = 31.5°. 

Total arc AB + BC + CD + DA = 139.5 +40.5 +31.5 +148.5 = 139.5+40.5=180; 31.5+148.5=180; total 360°. Correct. 

Now, what about arc BD? It should be arc BC + arc CD = 40.5 +31.5 = 72°, which matches. 

Now, angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, so measure is 2a -5 = 2*37.375 -5 = 74.75 -5 = 69.75°. 

But this is approximately 70°, which is close to 72°, but not matching any option. 

However, the options are A. 72, B. 108, C. 120, D. 144. 

This suggests that there's still an inconsistency. 

But let's check if there's another way. Let's assume that the angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD. Wait, but why? 

If the angle is at F, it can't be an inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, if the angle is at B, then it would subtend arc AD. 

But this is speculation. 

Alternatively, let's look back at the given equations. 

We have:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,D)) = 72° → arc BD = 72° (central angle).

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 4a -1° → arc AD = 4a -1° (central angle).

MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,B)) = 2a -5° → if it's an inscribed angle, it subtends arc AD. 

Wait, if angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, then 2a -5 = ½ * arc AD → 2a -5 = ½*(4a -1) → 2a -5 = 2a - 0.5 → subtract 2a: -5 = -0.5, which is false. 

No good. 

Alternatively, if it subtends arc AC, which is 180°, then 2a -5 = ½*180 → 2a -5 = 90 → 2a = 95 → a = 47.5. 

Then, angle AFB = 2a -5 = 95 -5 = 90°. Not in options. 

Alternatively, if it subtends arc AB, and it's an inscribed angle, then 2a -5 = ½ * arc AB. 

But arc AB = ? 

If arc AB is part of the circle, and we have arc AD = 4a -1, arc BD = 72°, and arc AC = 180°. 

Let me try to express arc AB in terms of other arcs. 

Assuming points are arranged as A-B-C-D-A. 

Then, arc AB + arc BC = 180°. 

arc AD = arc AB + arc BC + arc CD? No, arc AD would be the arc from A to D, which could be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD if D is on the other side, but that would be 180° + arc CD. 

But arc AD is given as 4a -1, which would be greater than 180° if arc CD is positive. 

Alternatively, arc AD is the minor arc, so arc AD = 4a -1. 

If arc AD is the minor arc, then 4a -1 < 180 → a < 45.25. 

Also, arc BD = 72°, which could be arc BC + arc CD = 72°. 

Let me define:

arc AB = x

arc BC = y

arc CD = z

arc DA = w = 4a -1

With x + y = 180°.

Also, y + z = 72°.

Total circumference: x + y + z + w = 360 → x + y + z + (4a -1) = 360. 

Substitute x + y = 180, and y + z = 72 → z = 72 - y. 

So:

180 + (72 - y) + (4a -1) = 360 → 180 + 72 - y + 4a -1 = 360 → 251 - y + 4a = 360 → -y + 4a = 109 → y = 4a -109. 

Now, since y = arc BC = 4a -109, and since arc lengths cannot be negative, 4a -109 ≥ 0 → a ≥ 27.25. 

Also, since w = 4a -1 < 180 → a < 45.25. 

So a ∈ [27.25, 45.25). 

Now, if angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, then its measure is ½ * arc AB = ½*x = 2a -5. 

So, x = 4a -10. 

But x = arc AB = 4a -10. 

But x = 180 - y = 180 - (4a -109) = 180 -4a +109 = 289 -4a. 

So, 289 -4a = 4a -10 → 289 +10 = 8a → 299 = 8a → a = 299/8 = 37.375. 

Which is within the allowed range. 

Now, calculate x = 4a -10 = 4*37.375 -10 = 149.5 -10 = 139.5°. 

So, measure of angle AFB is ½ * x = 139.5 / 2 = 69.75°. 

Still not matching the options. 

But let's check the options: A. 72, B. 108, C. 120, D. 144. 

Closest is 72, but it's slightly off. 

But perhaps there's rounding or a calculation error. 

Wait, let's check if there's another way. 

If angle AFB is an inscribed angle subtending arc BD, which is 72°, then its measure would be 36°, not matching. 

Alternatively, if it subtends arc AC (180°), then 90°, not matching. 

Alternatively, if it subtends arc AD, which is 4a -1 = 4*37.375 -1 = 149.5 -1 = 148.5°, then the inscribed angle would be 74.25°, not matching. 

Hmm. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the problem's setup. 

But given the options, and the closest possible value is 72°, which is option A. 

But in our calculation, with a = 37.375, angle AFB is 69.75°, which is close to 72°, possibly due to rounding. 

Alternatively, if there's an error in the calculation, let's try to find a value of a that makes angle AFB = 72°. 

If angle AFB is an inscribed angle, then 2a -5 = 72 → 2a = 77 → a = 38.5. 

Then, let's check if this works. 

With a = 38.5, arc AB = 4a -10 = 4*38.5 -10 = 154 -10 = 144°. 

Then, measure of angle AFB = 144/2 = 72°, which matches. 

Now, let's check consistency. 

arc AB = 144°, arc BC = 4a -109 = 4*38.5 -109 = 154 -109 = 45°. 

Then, arc BD = y + z = 72°, where y = arc BC = 45°, so z = 72 -45 = 27°. 

Arc AD = 4a -1 = 4*38.5 -1 = 154 -1 = 153°. 

Now, total circumference: arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 144 +45 +27 +153 = 144+45=189, 27+153=180, total 369°. Wait, that's 369°, which is more than 360°. Contradiction. 

Ah, here's the problem. 

Because arc AD = 153°, and arc AB = 144°, and arc BC = 45°, arc CD = 27°, total is 144+45+27+153 = 369°. 

This is incorrect. 

Where is the mistake? 

The calculation for arc AD is 4a -1 = 153°, but arc AD is supposed to be part of the total circumference. 

But with arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 144 +45 +27 +153 = 369°, which exceeds 360°. 

This indicates inconsistency. 

But why? 

Because arc AD is defined as 4a -1, which in this case is 153°, but arc AD is also part of the total. 

But if arc AD is 153°, then the total circumference would be arc AB + arc BC
