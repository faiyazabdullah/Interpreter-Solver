MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question says that angle 1 and angle 2 form a linear pair, and the measure of angle 2 is 67 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1.

First, I remember that a linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. That means the two angles are supplementary, right? Because they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, yes, because a straight line is 180 degrees, so if two angles make a linear pair, their measures should sum to 180.

So, if angle 1 and angle 2 are a linear pair, then m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°. They gave us that m∠2 is 67°, so plugging that in, we have m∠1 + 67° = 180°. To find m∠1, subtract 67 from 180. Let me do the math: 180 minus 67 equals... 113. So, m∠1 should be 113 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, B is 113. So the answer must be B. Let me double-check. Linear pairs are supplementary, so yeah, adding up to 180. Given one angle is 67, the other is 180-67=113. Yep, that seems right. No other theorems needed here, just the definition of a linear pair. So the correct answer is B.
