<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

Starting with the geometric shapes: There's a Triangle(L, I, J) and a Rectangle(L, I, J, K). Also, there are points L, I, J, K. Then there are several Line predicates connecting these points: Line(L,I), Line(I,J), Line(J,K), Line(L,K), Line(L,J). Wait, so the rectangle has four sides: LI, IJ, JK, KL? But also, the triangle is formed by L, I, J. Hmm, maybe the rectangle is connected such that L, I, J, K form its vertices?

Then there are some angle-related predicates. RightAngle(Angle(L, I, J)) means that the angle at point I between lines L-I-J is a right angle. So triangle L-I-J is a right triangle with the right angle at I. That makes sense because the other predicates mention IsHypotenuseOf(Line(L,J), Triangle(...)), which would imply that Line(L,J) is the hypotenuse. In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at I, the hypotenuse should be LJ. Let me check the LengthOf predicates: Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,J)), 13), Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,K)), 12), Equals(LengthOf(Line(I,K)), 5). 

So, if we consider triangle L-I-J being a right triangle with legs LI and IJ, but wait, the hypotenuse is LJ. Wait, but according to the IsHypotenuseOf predicate, Line(L,J) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the right angle is at I. So the two legs would be LI and IJ, and hypotenuse LJ. But then there's another line mentioned: Line(L,K) with length 12, and Line(I,K) with length 5. Also, since it's a rectangle, perhaps K is connected to L and I? Let me try to visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points L, I, J, K forming a rectangle. So in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. However, the triangle L-I-J is part of this rectangle. If the rectangle has vertices L, I, J, K, then the sides would be LI, IJ, JK, KL. But then, the lines given include Line(L,I), Line(I,J), Line(J,K), Line(L,K). Wait, Line(L,K) would be one of the diagonals? Or maybe not. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. But here, Line(L,K) is mentioned as a side? Wait, the rectangle has four sides: LI, IJ, JK, and KL. So Line(L,K) would be a diagonal if K is connected to L directly. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent corners are connected by sides. So if the rectangle is L-I-J-K-L, then the sides are LI, IJ, JK, KL. So the diagonals would be LK and IJ? Wait, no. Diagonals connect opposite corners. So in rectangle L-I-J-K, the diagonals would be L-J and I-K. Because L connects to J via diagonal, and I connects to K via diagonal. But in the given predicates, there's a Line(L,K), which would be the diagonal from L to K. And Line(I,K) is given with length 5. 

But also, the triangle L-I-J is a right triangle with right angle at I. So in triangle L-I-J, angle at I is right, so sides LI and IJ are perpendicular. Now, given the lengths: LJ (hypotenuse) is 13, LI and IJ are the legs. Wait, but where does K come into play?

Wait, the Rectangle(L, I, J, K) implies that all sides are connected. So LI is a side, IJ is another side, JK is next, and KL closes the rectangle. So the rectangle has sides LI, IJ, JK, and KL. Therefore, the diagonals of the rectangle would be LK and IJ. Wait, but IJ is a side of the rectangle, not a diagonal. Wait, no—if it's a rectangle, the diagonals are from L to J and from I to K. Because in rectangle L-I-J-K, the diagonals are L-J and I-K. 

Given that, Line(L,K) is one of the sides? No, because in the rectangle, the sides are LI, IJ, JK, and KL. So KL is a side. So Line(L,K) is a side of the rectangle. Therefore, KL is a side. Then, Line(I,K) is another side of the rectangle? Wait, I to K would be a side if the rectangle is ordered L-I-J-K-L. Wait, but then IJ is a side, JK is a side, KL is a side, and then back to L. So the rectangle's sides are LI, IJ, JK, and KL. So the diagonals are L-J and I-K. 

Now, looking at the lengths: Line(L,K) has length 12, Line(I,K) has length 5. Wait, Line(I,K) is a diagonal of the rectangle? Because if the rectangle's sides are LI, IJ, JK, KL, then the diagonals are L-J and I-K. So Line(I,K) is a diagonal of the rectangle. Therefore, its length would be sqrt(LI^2 + IJ^2) since it's the diagonal of the rectangle. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So the length of diagonal I-K equals the length of diagonal L-J. Wait, but according to the given data, the hypotenuse of triangle L-I-J is LJ with length 13. So LJ = 13. But the diagonal IK (from I to K) would have the same length as LJ. Therefore, the length of IK should be 13, but according to the given, LengthOf(Line(I,K)) is 5. That seems conflicting. Wait, that suggests something is wrong here. Maybe my assumption about the structure is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle isn't L-I-J-K in order. Maybe the rectangle is arranged differently. For example, suppose the rectangle has sides LI, LK, and others. Wait, but the rectangle is defined by four points: L, I, J, K. So the sides are LI, IJ, JK, KL. But if that's the case, then the diagonals are L-J and I-K. But the given data says that Line(I,K) has length 5, while Line(L,J) has length 13. Which would make those diagonals different lengths unless the rectangle is a square. But since 5 and 13 aren't equal, that contradicts. Therefore, my initial assumption about the rectangle's configuration must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's focus on the triangle first. We have a right triangle L-I-J with right angle at I. The hypotenuse is LJ, which is 13 units long. The legs are LI and IJ. But we also have other lines: Line(L,K), Line(I,K), etc., with lengths 12 and 5 respectively. 

Looking at the given LengthOf(Line(L,K)) = 12 and LengthOf(Line(I,K)) = 5. These could be sides of the rectangle. Suppose that Point K is connected to L and I. If the rectangle includes points L, I, J, K, then perhaps K is positioned such that LK and IK are sides of the rectangle. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, think of the rectangle having sides LI and LK. Then, since it's a rectangle, angle at L is 90 degrees. So LI and LK are perpendicular. But then, if the triangle L-I-J is a right triangle with right angle at I, then LI and IJ are perpendicular. So combining these, maybe the rectangle is made up of LI and LK as adjacent sides, and IJ is another side? Not sure yet.

Wait, let's take the given data again. The triangle has sides: LI, IJ, and hypotenuse LJ=13. Also, there are lines: LK with length 12 and IK with length 5. 

Since the rectangle is L, I, J, K, then each pair of adjacent points forms a side. So if we assume that the rectangle is L-I-K-J-L? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is L-I-J-K, making sides LI, IJ, JK, and KL. Then, the diagonals are L-J and I-K. As before, but the given lengths suggest that I-K is 5 and L-J is 13. So that would require that the diagonals of the rectangle are 5 and 13, which is impossible because in a rectangle diagonals are equal. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my previous assumption about the rectangle's configuration must be wrong.

Another possibility: The rectangle is not L-I-J-K in order. Perhaps it's L-I-K-J? Then the sides would be LI, IK, KJ, JL. Then the diagonals would be LK and IJ. In that case, the diagonal LK would have length 12 (given as LengthOf(Line(L,K))=12), and the diagonal IJ would have length 5 (since LengthOf(Line(I,K))=5? Wait no, Line(I,K) would be a side in this case. Wait, if the rectangle is L-I-K-J, then sides are LI, IK, KJ, JL. Then, the diagonals are LK and IJ. So diagonal LK is from L to K, which is given as length 12. Diagonal IJ is from I to J, which is a side of the triangle. Wait, but in the triangle, IJ is one of the legs. Given that the triangle L-I-J is right-angled at I, so IJ is a leg, and LI is another leg. Hypotenuse is LJ. 

But according to this scenario, the diagonal IJ would be a side of the rectangle. Wait, but in the rectangle, the diagonals are LK and IJ. So the length of diagonal IJ would be the same as diagonal LK. But given that Line(I,K) is a side of the rectangle (since the rectangle's sides are LI, IK, KJ, JL), then Line(I,K) is a side of the rectangle, which has length 5. So if the rectangle's side IK is 5, then the other sides... Well, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So LI equals KJ, and IK equals JL. 

Also, the diagonals of the rectangle are equal. So diagonal LK equals diagonal IJ. But in the triangle, the hypotenuse LJ is 13. Wait, but if diagonal IJ is equal to diagonal LK, which is 12 (since Line(L,K) is 12), then diagonal IJ would be 12. But in the triangle, IJ is a leg, not the hypotenuse. Wait, the hypotenuse is LJ, which is 13. So in the triangle L-I-J, the legs are LI and IJ, and hypotenuse LJ=13. 

But if diagonal IJ is 12, then that would mean that IJ is 12. But then, using Pythagoras, LI² + IJ² = LJ² → LI² + 12² = 13² → LI² = 169 - 144 = 25 → LI = 5. But then, in the rectangle, since IK is a side with length 5 (as per Line(I,K)=5), and since in the rectangle, opposite sides are equal, then LI equals KJ and IK equals JL. So LI=5, and IK=5. But earlier calculation gives LI=5, and IK=5. Wait, but in the rectangle, if LI and IK are adjacent sides, then the sides of the rectangle would be LI=5 and IK=5, making it a square? But then diagonals would be sqrt(5²+5²) = sqrt(50) ≈7.07, but according to the given, diagonal LK is 12. Contradiction again. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the mistake lies in assuming that IJ is a diagonal of the rectangle. Let's re-examine the given predicates. The Rectangle(L, I, J, K) — perhaps the rectangle is not necessarily having IJ as a diagonal. Maybe the rectangle is constructed such that L, I, J, K are arranged with LI, LK as adjacent sides. For example, imagine point L connected to I and K, forming a right angle at L. Then, I is connected to J, and K is connected to J, forming the rectangle. 

In this case, the rectangle would have sides LI, LK, KJ, and JI. So the sides are LI, LK, KJ, JI. Then, the diagonals would be L-J and I-K. So diagonal L-J is from L to J, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, length 13. Diagonal I-K is from I to K, which is given as length 5. Therefore, diagonals of the rectangle are 13 and 5? But in a rectangle, diagonals are equal. This is a contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in how the rectangle is structured. Let's think differently. Maybe the rectangle is not involving all four points as vertices. Wait, the Rectangle(L, I, J, K) predicate likely indicates that these four points form a rectangle. Therefore, they must be the four vertices. 

But given that, the diagonals of the rectangle must be equal. However, the given lengths of the diagonals seem inconsistent. Let me try to calculate using the given lengths. 

We know that in the triangle L-I-J, which is a right triangle at I, with hypotenuse LJ=13. The legs are LI and IJ. From the given, the length of Line(L,K) is 12 and Line(I,K) is 5. 

Assuming that K is a corner of the rectangle, then perhaps K is connected to L and I. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Assign coordinates to the points. Let’s place point I at the origin (0,0) since the right angle is at I. Then, since it's a right triangle at I, let's say point L is along the x-axis and point J is along the y-axis. So, coordinates: I=(0,0), L=(a,0), J=(0,b). Then, the hypotenuse LJ has length √(a² + b²) = 13. 

Now, the rectangle involves points L, I, J, K. To find K, since it's a rectangle, we need to find the fourth vertex. In a rectangle, the fourth vertex can be found by vector addition. For instance, if we have three points of a rectangle, the fourth can be determined. Let me see. 

Suppose the rectangle has sides IL and IJ. Wait, but in our current setup, IL is horizontal (from I(0,0) to L(a,0)), and IJ is vertical (from I(0,0) to J(0,b)). Then, the fourth vertex K would be at (a,b), completing the rectangle. But then, the diagonals of the rectangle would be from L(a,0) to J(0,b) and from I(0,0) to K(a,b). Wait, but the diagonal from I to K would be the same as the diagonal from L to J. So length of diagonal I-K would be sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2) = same as LJ, which is 13. But according to the given, the length of Line(I,K) is 5. This contradicts. 

However, the given says that LengthOf(Line(I,K))=5. So in this coordinate system, Line(I,K) would be from (0,0) to (a,b), which has length sqrt(a² + b²) = 13. But the given says it's 5. So this doesn't fit. 

Alternative idea: Maybe K is not the fourth vertex of the rectangle in this way. Perhaps the rectangle is formed differently. For example, suppose that the rectangle has sides LI and LK. So from point L, going to I and to K. Since the triangle is L-I-J, which is right-angled at I. So LI is one leg, and IJ is another. 

If LK is another side of the rectangle, then since the rectangle has right angles, angle at L would be 90 degrees. So LI and LK are perpendicular. Thus, if LI is along x-axis from L to I, then LK would be along y-axis from L to K. Then, the rectangle would have points L, I, K, and another point. Wait, but the rectangle is supposed to have four points: L, I, J, K. So maybe J is another corner. 

This is getting too abstract. Let me use the given lengths. 

From the triangle L-I-J, right-angled at I, with hypotenuse LJ=13. So, by Pythagoras: LI² + IJ² = 13² = 169. 

Additionally, we have Line(L,K) with length 12 and Line(I,K) with length 5. So, considering these two lines, perhaps they relate to the rectangle. 

If K is a point such that LK=12 and IK=5, then we can think of triangle L-I-K. Using coordinates again, let's set I at (0,0), L at (x,0), and K somewhere. 

But if I is at (0,0), and K is a point such that distance from I to K is 5, and from L to K is 12. Also, since L is at (x,0), then the distance from L to K is sqrt((x_K - x_L)^2 + (y_K - y_L)^2) = 12. 

But without knowing more, this might not help directly. However, perhaps K is part of the rectangle. If the rectangle has sides LI and LK, then since it's a rectangle, angle at L is 90°, so LI ⊥ LK. So, if LI is along x-axis, then LK is along y-axis. So, if I is at (0,0), L is at (a,0), and K is at (a, b), then the rectangle would have points L(a,0), I(0,0), K(a,b), and another point. Wait, but the rectangle needs four points. Maybe the fourth point is J? 

Wait, the rectangle is supposed to include points L, I, J, K. So if L, I, and K are three points, then J must be the fourth. How? 

Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let's fix I at (0,0). Let's assume that the right triangle L-I-J has legs LI and IJ. Let's assign coordinates: I=(0,0), L=(a,0), J=(0,b), so that LI is from (0,0) to (a,0), and IJ is from (0,0) to (0,b). Then, the hypotenuse LJ is from (a,0) to (0,b), with length sqrt(a² + b²)=13. 

Now, the rectangle is L, I, J, K. Where is K? In a rectangle, the fourth vertex can be found by adding vectors. For example, from point L, moving in the direction from I to J. Wait, in a parallelogram, the fourth vertex can be found by adding the vector from I to J to point L. So, vector IJ is (0,b)-(0,0)=(0,b). Adding this to L(a,0) gives K at (a, b). So K would be at (a,b). 

Thus, the rectangle would have vertices L(a,0), I(0,0), J(0,b), and K(a,b). Then, the sides of the rectangle are LI (from L to I), IJ (from I to J), JK (from J to K), and KL (from K to L). 

Now, checking the lengths: 

- Line(L,K): from L(a,0) to K(a,b), which is vertical line, length = b. 
- Line(I,K): from I(0,0) to K(a,b), which is diagonal, length sqrt(a² + b²)=13. 

But according to the given, Line(I,K) has length 5, but in this case it's 13. Conflict again. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, Line(I,K) is given to have length 5. So this suggests that my assumption about the position of K is incorrect. 

Alternative idea: Maybe K is not the point (a,b) but another point. Suppose that instead of the rectangle being L-I-J-K as described above, it's a different arrangement. For example, suppose that the rectangle has sides LI and IK. So, from point L, go to I, then from I to K, then from K to J, then from J back to L. 

In this case, since it's a rectangle, LI and IK are adjacent sides, meeting at right angle at I. So, if I is at (0,0), L is at (a,0), and K is at (0,c), then the fourth point J would be at (a, c) to complete the rectangle. Then, the sides would be LI (from L to I), IK (from I to K), KJ (from K to J), and JL (from J to L). 

In this scenario, the diagonals of the rectangle would be LK and IJ. Let's compute their lengths. 

- Line(L,K): from L(a,0) to K(0,c), length sqrt(a² + c²).
- Line(I,J): from I(0,0) to J(a,c), length sqrt(a² + c²).

So diagonals are equal, as expected. 

Now, in the triangle L-I-J, which is a right triangle with right angle at I. Wait, in this scenario, J is at (a,c). So the triangle L-I-J has vertices at L(a,0), I(0,0), J(a,c). This would form a right triangle at I? Let me check. The vectors IL is (a,0) - (0,0) = (a,0), and IJ is (a,c) - (0,0) = (a,c). The dot product of IL and IJ is a*a + 0*c = a² ≠ 0, so they are not perpendicular. Therefore, the triangle L-I-J is not right-angled at I. Contradicts the given RightAngle(Angle(L,I,J)). 

So this configuration doesn't work. 

Maybe the right angle is at a different vertex. Wait, the problem states that the right angle is at Angle(L, I, J), which is the angle at point I between lines L-I and I-J. So the right angle is at I. Therefore, vectors IL and IJ must be perpendicular. 

So in the triangle L-I-J, vectors IL and IJ are perpendicular. So in coordinates, if I is at (0,0), then L is at (a,0) and J is at (0,b), making IL and IJ perpendicular. 

Now, the rectangle involves points L, I, J, K. Let's think again about where K is. In this case, since it's a rectangle, and we already have L, I, J, what's K? 

If the rectangle has sides IL and IJ, then the fourth point would be L + IJ vector. Wait, the rectangle can be constructed by translating one side. For example, starting from point I, move along IL to get to L, then from L move along IJ to get to J, but that's part of the triangle. Alternatively, the rectangle could be formed by extending sides. 

Alternatively, since we have a rectangle with points L, I, J, K, and we know three of them, we can find K. In a rectangle, the fourth point can be found by adding the vector from I to J to point L, or similar. 

As before, if I is at (0,0), L is at (a,0), J is at (0,b), then the fourth point K would be at (a,b), completing the rectangle. 

Now, in this case, the Line(I,K) would be from I(0,0) to K(a,b), which is the diagonal of the rectangle, length sqrt(a² + b²) = 13. But according to the problem, Line(I,K) has length 5. Contradiction again. 

But the problem states that Line(I,K) has length 5. So this suggests that either my coordinate assignment is wrong, or there's another interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps K is not the fourth vertex of the rectangle but another point. Let me look at the given Line predicates: Line(L,K), Line(I,K), Line(J,K), Line(L,J), etc. 

Wait, the Line(L,K) is given as length 12, Line(I,K) is 5. So in the rectangle, if K is a vertex, then Line(L,K) and Line(I,K) are sides or diagonals. 

Alternatively, maybe K is not part of the rectangle's vertices but another point. Wait, the Rectangle(L, I, J, K) predicate implies that all four points are vertices of the rectangle. So K must be one of the vertices. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the conflict between the diagonal lengths. Let me try to use the given lengths to solve for a and b. 

From the triangle: LI² + IJ² = 13² = 169. 

Also, from the rectangle, if K is such that Line(I,K) = 5 and Line(L,K) = 12. Assuming that in the rectangle, K is connected to both L and I, then the distances from L to K and from I to K are sides of the rectangle. Wait, if the rectangle has sides LI and IK, then LI and IK are adjacent sides. So in this case, LI is one leg of the triangle, and IK is another segment. 

So, in this case, if LI is length a, and IK is length 5 (since Line(I,K)=5), then the rectangle has sides a and 5. The diagonal of the rectangle would be sqrt(a² + 5²). But this diagonal would also be the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is 13. So:

sqrt(a² + 5²) = 13 → a² + 25 = 169 → a² = 144 → a = 12. 

Ah! This fits! So LI = 12, and IK = 5. Therefore, in the rectangle, sides are LI=12 and IK=5, making the diagonal sqrt(12² + 5²) = 13, which matches the hypotenuse LJ=13. 

Therefore, this resolves the contradiction. 

So, in this configuration, the rectangle has sides LI=12 and IK=5, and the diagonal is 13. So the rectangle is formed by points L, I, K, and another point. Wait, but where is J? 

Earlier, we had the triangle L-I-J being right-angled at I, with hypotenuse LJ=13. So J must be the endpoint of the other leg. Since in the rectangle, we have sides LI=12 and IK=5, and the diagonal is 13. So if J is the other corner of the rectangle, then J would be the point such that IJ is the other leg of the triangle. 

Wait, in this case, since the rectangle has sides LI and IK, then the other sides are KJ and JL. So, point J would be located at the end of IK plus the vector from L to I? Not sure. Let me clarify with coordinates. 

Let me set I at (0,0). Since LI=12, and assuming it's along x-axis, L is at (12,0). IK=5, and since it's a rectangle, IK is perpendicular to LI. Since LI is along x-axis, IK would be along y-axis. So K is at (0,5). Now, the rectangle has points L(12,0), I(0,0), K(0,5), and the fourth point J. To complete the rectangle, J would be at (12,5). 

Now, the triangle L-I-J is formed by points L(12,0), I(0,0), and J(12,5). Wait, but then the triangle would have vertices at (12,0), (0,0), and (12,5). Let's check if this is a right triangle at I. 

Vectors IL = (12,0) - (0,0) = (12,0). Vector IJ = (12,5) - (0,0) = (12,5). Dot product of IL and IJ is 12*12 + 0*5 = 144 ≠ 0. So they are not perpendicular. Hence, the triangle is not right-angled at I. Contradiction again. 

Wait, what's wrong here? The problem states that the triangle L-I-J is right-angled at I. So vectors IL and IJ must be perpendicular. 

So in this configuration, with I at (0,0), L at (12,0), and J at (0,5), then vectors IL is (12,0) and IJ is (0,5). Their dot product is 12*0 + 0*5 = 0, which means they are perpendicular. Ah! I made a mistake in choosing J's coordinates. 

If J is at (0,5), then the triangle L-I-J would have points L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5). Let's verify: 

- IL is from I to L: (12,0)
- IJ is from I to J: (0,5)
These are perpendicular. 

Then, the hypotenuse LJ is from L(12,0) to J(0,5). Its length is sqrt((12-0)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. Perfect, that matches the given. 

Now, the rectangle is L, I, J, K. Wait, in this case, the rectangle has points L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K. What is K? Earlier, we said K is at (0,5)? No, J is at (0,5). Wait, no. Previously, we had K at (0,5). Wait, but in this case, J is at (0,5), so K must be another point. Wait, the rectangle is supposed to have four points: L, I, J, K. 

Wait, in this scenario, we have points L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K. To form a rectangle, what is K? 

Since it's a rectangle, the fourth point K should be such that the sides are LI, IJ, JK, and KL. Wait, but if we already have L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), then to complete the rectangle, K should be at (12,5), because from L(12,0) to K(12,5) is vertical, matching the side from I(0,0) to J(0,5). 

So, the rectangle has points L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K(12,5). 

Now, let's check the lines mentioned in the predicates:

- Line(L,K): from L(12,0) to K(12,5), length is 5. But the given says LengthOf(Line(L,K)) is 12. Wait, this is a problem. According to this configuration, Line(L,K) is vertical from (12,0) to (12,5), which has length 5. But the problem states that LengthOf(Line(L,K)) is 12. So this is a contradiction. 

What's wrong here? Let me re-examine. 

The given says that LengthOf(Line(L,K)) is 12. In this configuration, it's 5. So something is wrong. 

Wait, maybe I mixed up the points. Let's revisit. 

We have the rectangle with points L, I, J, K. In our scenario, we have L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K(12,5). So Line(L,K) is from L(12,0) to K(12,5), which is indeed 5 units. But the problem says it's 12. So this suggests that my assumption about the location of K is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps K is not at (12,5). Let me think again. 

If the rectangle has points L, I, J, K, and we have LI=12, IK=5, then in the rectangle, the sides are LI=12 and IK=5. So, if I is at (0,0), L is at (12,0), and K is at (0,5), then the fourth point J would be at (12,5). But then, the triangle L-I-J is formed by L(12,0), I(0,0), J(12,5)? No, because then J would be at (12,5), and IJ would be from (0,0) to (12,5), which is not perpendicular to IL. 

Wait, but earlier, I thought J was at (0,5), but that led to Line(L,K) being 5, conflicting with given 12. 

Alternatively, perhaps K is at (12,5), making Line(L,K) length 5. But the given says it should be 12. So I'm missing something. 

Wait, let's recall that in the given, the Line(L,K) has length 12. So in our previous setup, we have Line(L,K) as 5, which is incorrect. So how to adjust this? 

Perhaps the rectangle is not formed with sides LI and IK, but with other sides. Let's consider that K is such that Line(L,K) is 12 and Line(I,K) is 5. So, from point I(0,0), K is at some point (x,y) such that distance from I to K is 5, and from L(12,0) to K is 12. 

Let me write equations for this. 

Coordinates: I(0,0), L(12,0). Let K(x,y). 

Distance from I to K: sqrt(x² + y²) = 5 → x² + y² = 25.

Distance from L to K: sqrt((x-12)^2 + y²) = 12 → (x-12)^2 + y² = 144.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 

(x-12)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 144 - 25 → expand (x² -24x + 144) - x² = 119 → -24x + 144 = 119 → -24x = -25 → x = 25/24 ≈ 1.0417. 

So x = 25/24, and y² = 25 - x² = 25 - (625/576) = (14400/576 - 625/576) = 13775/576. 

So y = ±√(13775)/24. Let's calculate √13775. Well, 13775 = 25 * 551, so √25*551 = 5√551. Not a nice number, but perhaps it's okay. 

Now, with this K, the rectangle includes points L, I, J, K. But where is J? 

Recall that the triangle L-I-J is right-angled at I, with hypotenuse LJ=13. So J must be a point such that IJ is perpendicular to IL. 

Since IL is from I(0,0) to L(12,0), which is along x-axis. So IJ must be vertical. So J is at (0, b) for some b. 

Then, the hypotenuse LJ is from L(12,0) to J(0,b), length sqrt(12² + b²) = 13 → 144 + b² = 169 → b² = 25 → b = 5 or -5. Let's take b=5, so J is at (0,5). 

Now, the rectangle has points L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K(25/24, y). But how does this form a rectangle? 

For a rectangle, all angles are 90°, and opposite sides are equal and parallel. Let's see. 

Points: L(12,0), I(0,0), J(0,5), and K(x,y). 

To form a rectangle, the vectors LI and IJ must be perpendicular, which they are. Now, to find K, it should satisfy that the sides are LI, IJ, JK, and KL. 

Vector LI is from I to L: (12,0). Vector IJ is from I to J: (0,5). 

To find K, it should be such that vector JK equals vector LI, and vector KL equals vector IJ. 

Vector JK should equal vector LI: from J(0,5) to K should be (12,0). So K = J + LI = (0+12, 5+0) = (12,5). 

But then, the distance from L(12,0) to K(12,5) is 5, which conflicts with the given Line(L,K) length of 12. So this suggests that K cannot be at (12,5). 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is formed with different sides. Let me think. If the rectangle has sides LI and IK, then K is such that IK is perpendicular to LI. Since LI is along x-axis, IK should be vertical. So from I(0,0), moving up to K(0,5), as before. Then, the rectangle would have points L(12,0), I(0,0), K(0,5), and J(12,5). But then, the triangle L-I-J would have J at (12,5), making IJ from I(0,0) to J(12,5), which is not perpendicular to IL. 

But earlier, we saw that if J is at (0,5), then IJ is vertical, and IL is horizontal, making them perpendicular. But then, where is K? It would be at (12,5), making Line(L,K) from (12,0) to (12,5), length 5, which conflicts with given 12. 

This seems like a dead end. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed the triangle's hypotenuse is LJ, but maybe it's not? Let me double-check the predicates. 

One of the predicates is IsHypotenuseOf(Line(L,J), Triangle(L,I,J)). So yes, Line(L,J) is the hypotenuse. So in the triangle, hypotenuse is LJ, which has length 13. 

So, returning to the earlier calculation where K is at (25/24, y), with x=25/24 and y=±√(13775)/24. This seems messy, but perhaps it's necessary. 

With this K, the rectangle is formed by points L, I, J, K. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not required to have all four points as vertices, but it's just a rectangle with those points, possibly overlapping? No, the predicate Rectangle(L, I, J, K) implies that these four points are the vertices. 

At this point, I think the confusion arises from the rectangle's configuration. Let me try to forget about the rectangle and focus on the triangle and the given lengths. 

We know that in the right triangle L-I-J, with right angle at I, hypotenuse LJ=13. Also, there is a point K such that Line(L,K)=12 and Line(I,K)=5. 

Using these, we can consider triangle L-I-K, where LI and IK are sides, and LK is the third side. Wait, but in this case, using the Law of Cosines: 

LK² = LI² + IK² - 2 * LI * IK * cos(theta), where theta is the angle at I between LI and IK. 

But we don't know theta. However, if we can find LI and IK, we can find LK. 

But we know LK is 12, and IK is 5. So:

12² = LI² + 5² - 2 * LI * 5 * cos(theta)

But we also know from the triangle L-I-J that LI² + IJ² = 13² = 169. 

But IJ is the other leg of the triangle. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, if we can relate theta to the triangle. If the angle at I in the triangle is 90°, and the angle between LI and IK is some angle, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the rectangle is involved, and we've tried various configurations without success, maybe it's better to focus on the triangle and the given lengths. 

We need to find tan(L). In the triangle L-I-J, angle at L. Wait, the question asks for the ratio of tan L. 

In triangle L-I-J, angle at L. Let me recall that in a right triangle, tan(angle) = opposite/adjacent. 

But the angle at L is not the right angle. The right angle is at I. So angle at L is one of the acute angles. 

Let me denote angle at L as θ. In triangle L-I-J, right-angled at I, so:

tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = IJ / LI. 

Because in the right triangle, angle at L: opposite side is IJ, adjacent is LI. 

So tan(L) = IJ / LI. 

Our goal is to find this ratio. 

From the given, we know that LJ = 13 (hypotenuse), and we have Line(L,K)=12 and Line(I,K)=5. 

But how do these relate to LI and IJ? 

If we can find LI and IJ, we can compute tan(L). 

From the triangle: LI² + IJ² = 13² = 169. 

Now, if we can find another equation relating LI and IJ, we can solve for them. 

Where does Line(L,K)=12 and Line(I,K)=5 come into play? 

Assuming that K is a point such that Line(L,K)=12 and Line(I,K)=5, and it's part of the rectangle. 

Let me consider triangle L-I-K. In this triangle, we have sides LI, IK, and LK. 

We know LK=12, IK=5. Let's call LI = a, so that:

a² + 5² - 2*a*5*cos(angle at I) = 12² 

But angle at I in this triangle is the angle between LI and IK. However, in the original triangle, the angle at I is 90°, but here, it's a different angle. Unless K is positioned such that this angle relates to the triangle. 

But without more info, this might not help. 

Wait, but if K is part of the rectangle, and we've previously deduced that in the rectangle, the sides are LI=12 and IK=5, leading to diagonal 13, which matches the hypotenuse. 

Wait, earlier, we had a scenario where LI=12, IK=5, and diagonal is 13, which fits. Even though the rectangle configuration seemed problematic, maybe it's acceptable. 

Let me assume that LI=12 and IK=5, and the diagonal is 13. 

Then, in the triangle L-I-J, which is right-angled at I, with LI=12 and IJ=5. Wait, but then hypotenuse would be sqrt(12² + 5²) = 13, which matches. 

Wait, this makes sense! So, in this case, the triangle has legs LI=12 and IJ=5, hypotenuse 13. 

So, tan(L) = opposite/adjacent = IJ/LI = 5/12 ≈ 0.4166..., which rounds to 0.42. 

This matches one of the answer choices, B. 

But why did the earlier rectangle configuration cause confusion? Because if LI=12 and IK=5
