MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus PQRS inscribed in a circle, and we need to find the measure of arc SP, denoted as m∠SP. Wait, actually, the question says "Find m ∠SP," but I think they mean the measure of the arc SP, since it's common to refer to arcs with such notation. Let me confirm that assumption later.

First, let me recall the given predicates. The Rhombus(P,Q,R,S) means that PQRS is a rhombus. Then there's a Circle(C), and points P, Q, R, S, and C. Lines connecting the points: PQ, QR, RS, SP, PR, QS. Also, the circle C is circumscribed around the rhombus, so the rhombus is cyclic. Additionally, point C is the midpoint of PR and QS. Also, PR and QS are perpendicular. All sides of the rhombus are congruent because it's a rhombus, so PQ = QR = RS = SP. Also, opposite sides are parallel, but since it's a rhombus, adjacent sides are congruent.

Wait, but if a rhombus is inscribed in a circle, that would make it a square? Because a rhombus has all sides equal, and if it's cyclic, meaning all vertices lie on a circle. But wait, a rhombus is cyclic only if it's a square. Because for a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So if a rhombus is cyclic, each pair of opposite angles must add up to 180°, which implies each angle is 90°, making it a square. Therefore, PQRS must be a square?

But the problem states it's a rhombus, not necessarily a square. However, if a rhombus is cyclic, then it must be a square. Therefore, maybe the given conditions force it to be a square. Let me check the other predicates.

Given that PR and QS are perpendicular. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So PR and QS intersect at 90 degrees. Also, since the rhombus is cyclic, meaning all four vertices lie on a circle. Wait, but in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, and they are also diameters of the circumscribed circle. So if the diagonals are diameters, then the center of the circle is the intersection point of the diagonals. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, their intersection point is the center of the circle. 

Moreover, the given predicates state that point C is the midpoint of PR and QS. That aligns with the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, point C is the center of the circle. 

So, since the rhombus is cyclic, it's a square. Therefore, all angles are 90°, and the arcs between consecutive points should be 90° each. But wait, the question asks for the measure of arc SP. If the rhombus is a square, then each side corresponds to a 90° arc. Wait, but in a circle, the arc length corresponding to a side of the square would depend on how the square is inscribed. Wait, in a square inscribed in a circle, each side subtends a 90° arc. For example, moving from one vertex to the next along the circumference, the arc between them would be 90°, since the square divides the circle into four equal parts. So the arc SP would be 90°, but let me verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the arc SP as the arc from S to P passing through the circle. But since it's a square, the arc SP would be three-quarters of the circle? No, wait. If you go from S to P along the circumference, depending on direction. Wait, but in a square inscribed in a circle, each arc between two adjacent vertices is 90°, so the arc SP would be the same as arc PS, which is 90°. Wait, but the question says "m ∠SP", which could be ambiguous. Maybe it's referring to the angle formed at point S by points P and something else? Or maybe it's the measure of arc SP. Given the answer choices include 90°, which is an option, but let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the problem isn't forcing the rhombus to be a square. Let me re-examine the given data. The rhombus is inscribed in a circle, which usually implies it's a square. But the problem gives more details. Let me consider that maybe the rhombus isn't a square, but still cyclic. Wait, but earlier logic suggests that's impossible unless it's a square. Unless there's some error in my thinking here.

Let me double-check: For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180°. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, if a rhombus is cyclic, then each pair of opposite angles must sum to 180°, implying each angle is 90°, hence a square. Therefore, the given figure must be a square. Thus, all sides are equal, diagonals are equal and perpendicular, and the circle is the circumcircle of the square.

Therefore, in this case, the measure of arc SP would correspond to the arc between points S and P. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, each arc between adjacent vertices is 90°, so the arc from S to P would pass through the next vertex. Wait, in order: suppose the square is labeled clockwise as P, Q, R, S. Then the arcs would be PQ, QR, RS, SP, each 90°. So the arc from S to P would be the arc going counterclockwise from S to P, which would be the same as the arc SP, which is 90°, but depending on the direction. Wait, but the arc SP could be considered as either the minor arc or major arc. But in standard notation, m∠SP without specifying direction would typically refer to the minor arc. However, if the points are arranged as a square, then the arc from S to P would be 90°, as each side corresponds to a quarter-circle. Hence, the measure would be 90°, which is option D. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, but another thought: in a square, the diagonals are diameters of the circle. Each diagonal spans 180°, so the diagonals are straight across the circle. So the arc from P to R is 180°, same for Q to S. Now, if we look at the arc SP, which connects S to P. Let me visualize the square. Suppose the square is placed such that its vertices are on the circle. Let's assign coordinates for clarity. Let’s say the center of the circle is at point C, which is the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are diameters, the length of each diagonal is twice the radius. In a square, the diagonals are equal. So the length PR equals QS. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, as given in the predicates.

Now, the arc SP. Starting from S and going to P. Depending on the position, the arc could be 90° or 270°, but since it's a minor arc, it's 90°. Alternatively, maybe the arc SP refers to the arc that doesn't contain the other points. Wait, but in a square, each arc between adjacent vertices is 90°, so SP would be the arc from S to P, which skips one vertex. Wait, if the square is P-Q-R-S-P, then moving from S to P directly would be the arc that goes through the side SP, which is adjacent. Wait, no—if you're on the circle, the arc SP would be the arc that connects S to P. If the square is inscribed, then moving from S to P would require going through the arc that's adjacent to the side SP. Wait, but SP is a side of the square. So the arc SP would be 90°, as each side corresponds to a 90° arc. Therefore, the measure of arc SP is 90°, which would be option D. However, let me check if there's another way this could be approached.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the angle at point S, but the notation is unclear. Wait, the question says "m ∠SP". Typically, angle notation like ∠SP would imply an angle with vertex at S, but the notation is ambiguous. However, since the problem mentions "arc SP" (maybe it's supposed to be arc SP), and the options are numerical values, likely representing arc measures. So assuming that, then arc SP is 90°, leading to answer D. But wait, let me check if there's another interpretation.

Another possibility: since the diagonals PR and QS are perpendicular and bisect each other, and the circle is circumscribed around the rhombus. The diagonals are diameters of the circle, so each diagonal is a diameter. Therefore, the length of PR is 2r, where r is the radius. In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy d1^2 + d2^2 = 4a^2, where a is the side length. But since it's a square, d1 = d2 = 2r * cos(45°)? Wait, no. In a square, the diagonals are equal. Let me think again. In a square, the diagonals are equal and each is sqrt(2) times the side length. If the diagonals are diameters of the circle, then each diagonal is 2r. Therefore, the side length of the square is (2r)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*r. 

But regardless of that, the arcs. Each arc between two adjacent vertices is 90°, so arc SP is 90°, so answer D. But wait, the answer options include 90 as option D. However, looking back at the answer choices, option D is 90. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, suppose the rhombus is not a square. But according to the previous reasoning, if a rhombus is cyclic, it must be a square. However, let me check that again. Let me take a general rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal. For it to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180°. Since in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so each pair of opposite angles adds to 180°, which means each angle is 90°, making it a square. Therefore, the given figure must be a square. Therefore, the arc SP is 90°, so answer D. But wait, the answer options include 90, so that would be D. However, let me check the problem statement again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.

Wait, the problem says "PQ R S is a rhombus inscribed in a circle." So, that's a cyclic rhombus, which must be a square. Hence, the arc SP is 90°, so answer D. However, the answer choices are A.30, B.45, C.60, D.90. So D is correct. But wait, let me think again—what if the arc SP refers to the arc that is not adjacent? For instance, in a square, the arc from S to P could be the arc that passes through the opposite side. Wait, but in a square, the arc SP would be either 90° or 270°, but the smaller arc is 90°. So yes, 90°. So answer D. But why would the answer not be 90? Is there a different interpretation?

Wait, maybe the question refers to the angle at point S, which is 90°, but that's the internal angle of the square. However, the question says "m ∠SP"—if that's meant to be the measure of angle at S between points P and something else. Wait, but the notation is unclear. If it's angle SP, then maybe it's angle at S between points P and another point. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the answer choices and the problem setup, the most plausible answer is D, 90°, which corresponds to the arc measure in the case of a square. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.
