Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates and see what they mean.

We have points W, X, Y, U, V, and a circle Z. There are two diameters mentioned: Line(W,U) and Line(V,Y). Both of these are diameters of circle Z. So, since diameters pass through the center, points W and U are endpoints of one diameter, and V and Y are endpoints of another diameter. That means the center of the circle Z must be the midpoint of both diameters. Therefore, the center point would be the intersection point of these two diameters. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the center explicitly. However, since both WU and VY are diameters, their intersection should be the center of the circle. But the circle is named Z, so maybe Z is the center? Wait, the circle is called Z, but usually, circles are named by their center. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again.

Wait, the first line says Circle(Z). So the circle is named Z. In standard notation, a circle is often denoted by its center, so perhaps Z is the center of the circle. Then, the diameters WU and VY are lines passing through the center Z. So points W, U, V, Y lie on the circle, and Z is the center. Wait, but if Z is the center, then the diameters would be lines connecting two points on the circle passing through Z. So, for example, Line(W,U) is a diameter, so Z lies on that line, meaning Z is the midpoint of WU. Similarly, Z is also the midpoint of VY.

Now, looking at the angles given. We have several angles involving point Z. Specifically:

- Angle(W,Z,X): This is the angle at point Z between points W and X.
- Angle(X,Z,Y): Angle at Z between X and Y.
- Angle(V,Z,U): Angle at Z between V and U.
- Angle(U,Z,Y): Angle at Z between U and Y.

Also, it's stated that Angle(W,Z,X) is congruent to Angle(X,Z,Y). And we have measures for Angle(V,Z,U) and Angle(U,Z,Y) in terms of x. Additionally, the sum of the measures of these four angles equals 360 degrees.

Wait, the last predicate says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,X)), MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,Y)), MeasureOf(Angle(V,Z,U)), MeasureOf(Angle(U,Z,Y)), 360). Wait, actually, the wording is SumOf(..., 360). Wait, that seems like the sum of those four angles equals 360. Because the way it's written, maybe the SumOf function takes the measure of each angle and adds them up, and the total is 360. So:

MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,X)) + MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,Y)) + MeasureOf(Angle(V,Z,U)) + MeasureOf(Angle(U,Z,Y)) = 360 degrees.

But wait, angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. Since all these angles are at point Z, which is the center of the circle. So, if we consider all the angles formed at the center by various radii, their sum would indeed be 360 degrees. Therefore, the sum of these four angles equals 360 degrees.

So, let me note down the equations:

Given:

1. ∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY → So their measures are equal. Let's denote m∠WZX = m∠XZY = a.

2. m∠VZU = 4x.

3. m∠UZY = 2x + 24.

Additionally, the sum of all four angles is 360:

a + a + 4x + (2x + 24) = 360.

So simplifying:

2a + 6x + 24 = 360.

Which leads to 2a + 6x = 336, dividing both sides by 2 gives a + 3x = 168. Equation (1).

Now, I need more relations to find the value of x and then compute the desired arc measure.

Wait, but what about the other parts of the diagram? Let me think about the positions of the points.

Since WU and VY are diameters, they intersect at the center Z. So, points W, U are on opposite ends of the circle via diameter WU, same with V and Y. Now, considering the angles at Z:

Let me try to visualize the circle with center Z. Points W and U are endpoints of one diameter, so they are directly opposite each other. Similarly, V and Y are endpoints of another diameter. The angles given involve points X, which isn't necessarily on the diameter. Wait, but where is point X?

Wait, the angles given are ∠WZX, ∠XZY, ∠VZU, ∠UZY. These angles are all at point Z. So, each angle has vertex at Z, with rays going to another point. For instance, ∠WZX has rays ZW and ZX. Similarly, ∠XZY has rays ZX and ZY. So, points W, X, Y are connected through Z. Similarly, ∠VZU involves rays ZV and ZU.

Therefore, the arrangement suggests that points W, X, Y, V, U are placed around the circle such that Z is the center, and these points are connected through Z. 

But since WU and VY are diameters, points W and U are opposite, V and Y are opposite. So, the lines WU and VY cross at Z. Now, point X is somewhere on the circumference, but not necessarily aligned with the diameters. 

However, the angles given involve points X and others. Let me think about the arcs corresponding to these angles. Since Z is the center, the measure of an angle at the center is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. For example, ∠WZX intercepts arc WX, so the measure of ∠WZX is equal to the measure of arc WX. Similarly, ∠XZY intercepts arc XY, and so on.

Wait, but angles at the center correspond to their intercepted arcs. Therefore:

m∠WZX = measure of arc WX,

m∠XZY = measure of arc XY,

m∠VZU = measure of arc VU,

m∠UZY = measure of arc UY.

Wait, but hold on, because ∠VZU is formed by points V, Z, U. So, the angle at Z between V and U. Since V and U are endpoints of diameters. Wait, but V is part of diameter VY, and U is part of diameter WU. Depending on how the diameters are arranged, the position of V relative to U could vary. But since they are both diameters passing through Z, their positions depend on the configuration.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the entire setup with coordinates. Suppose we place Z at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to make things clearer. Let’s assume that W is (-1, 0), U is (1, 0) since they are endpoints of a horizontal diameter. Then, V and Y are endpoints of another diameter; let's say this diameter is vertical for simplicity, so V is (0,1) and Y is (0,-1). But this may not capture all possibilities, but it's a starting point.

But perhaps instead of coordinates, it's better to use the fact that the sum of the angles around Z is 360 degrees, and each angle corresponds to an arc. Also, since WU and VY are diameters, certain arcs are straight lines (180 degrees). Let me try to break down the arcs.

First, the diameters divide the circle into semicircles. The measure of arc WU is 180 degrees, as it's a diameter. Similarly, arc VY is 180 degrees. Now, the other arcs are determined by the positions of points X and others.

But we have angles at Z:

- ∠WZX: intercepts arc WX. So measure of arc WX is a.

- ∠XZY: intercepts arc XY. Measure is a.

- ∠VZU: intercepts arc VU. Wait, but V and U are endpoints of different diameters. So, if V is on one diameter and U is on another, the arc from V to U depends on their positions. Alternatively, if we consider that VY is a diameter, then moving from V to Y is 180 degrees. Similarly, from W to U is 180 degrees.

But without knowing the exact positions of V and U relative to each other, perhaps we need another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the full circle. The sum of all arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. Each angle at the center corresponds to an arc, so adding up all the arcs would give 360. However, the angles given are ∠WZX, ∠XZY, ∠VZU, ∠UZY. But perhaps some arcs overlap or are combined.

Wait, let's think again. The angles at Z are:

1. ∠WZX: Between WZ and XZ. So, this spans from W to X along the circle.

2. ∠XZY: Between XZ and YZ. So, spans from X to Y.

3. ∠VZU: Between VZ and UZ. So, spans from V to U.

4. ∠UZY: Between UZ and YZ. Spans from U to Y.

So, combining these arcs:

Arc WX (from W to X),

Arc XY (from X to Y),

Arc VU (from V to U),

Arc UY (from U to Y).

Wait, but how do these arcs fit together? It depends on the positions of points X, V, U, Y.

But since VY is a diameter, arc VY is 180 degrees. Similarly, arc WU is 180 degrees.

But perhaps the arcs WX, XY, VU, and UY are parts of the entire circle. Let me try to imagine the circle with diameters WU and VY intersecting at Z. Let me suppose that the diameters WU and VY form some angle θ between them. Then, the arcs between their endpoints would depend on θ.

But maybe there's a better way. Let me go back to the equations.

From earlier, we had:

Equation (1): a + 3x = 168.

We need another equation to relate a and x. How can we get that?

Looking at the angles again. The angle ∠VZU is 4x, which is the measure of arc VU. Similarly, ∠UZY is 2x + 24, which is the measure of arc UY.

But arc VU and arc UY are parts of the circle. Since VY is a diameter, arc VY is 180 degrees. Arc VU plus arc UY equals arc VY. Therefore:

arc VU + arc UY = 180°.

But arc VU is 4x (since ∠VZU = 4x), and arc UY is 2x + 24. So:

4x + (2x + 24) = 180.

Simplify:

6x + 24 = 180 ⇒ 6x = 156 ⇒ x = 26.

Great! So x = 26. Now plug back into equation (1):

a + 3(26) = 168 ⇒ a + 78 = 168 ⇒ a = 90.

So, m∠WZX = a = 90°, and m∠XZY = 90°.

Now, the question asks for m∠WUX. Wait, no, the question says: "Find m ∠ W U X". Wait, wait, the original question says: "Find m ∠ W U X." Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the user wrote:

"Find m ∠ W U X."

Wait, but in the problem description, the angles given were at point Z. Wait, but the question is about ∠WUX, which is an angle at point U, between points W, U, and X. Wait, that's different from the angles at Z.

Hold on, this is crucial. The question is asking for the measure of angle WUX, which is an angle at point U, formed by points W, U, and X. So, ∠WUX is an inscribed angle? Or something else?

Wait, let me clarify. Point U is on the circle since it's an endpoint of diameter WU. So, U is on the circle. Similarly, X is another point on the circle (since angles at Z involve X). Therefore, points W, U, and X are all on the circle. So, ∠WUX is an angle at point U, with segments UW and UX. Since UW is a radius (if Z is the center), but wait, U is on the circle, and Z is the center. So, segment UZ is a radius. But ∠WUX is formed by points W, U, X. So, the angle at U between W and X.

To find the measure of ∠WUX, we can use the property of inscribed angles or other circle theorems.

But first, let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, ∠WUX is an angle at point U, so it's an inscribed angle if the vertex is on the circle. Wait, yes. So, ∠WUX intercepts an arc. Which arc?

The angle at U, between points W and X. So, the intercepted arc is the arc from W to X that does not contain U. Wait, but since U is on the circle, the intercepted arc would be the arc WX that is opposite to angle U. Wait, but depending on the position of X.

Alternatively, since U is a point on the circle, and we have points W and X on the circle, the angle ∠WUX is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. Wait, no. Inscribed angle at point U intercepting arc WX. Wait, but the inscribed angle at U intercepting arc WX would be half the measure of arc WX. However, since U is on the circle, the measure of ∠WUX is equal to half the measure of arc WX.

Wait, but earlier we found that arc WX is equal to m∠WZX, which was a = 90°. Wait, because ∠WZX is at the center, so it intercepts arc WX, whose measure is equal to the angle. Therefore, arc WX is 90°, so the inscribed angle over that arc would be half of that, which is 45°. But ∠WUX is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. Wait, but that would make ∠WUX = 45°, but none of the options is 45. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check. The angle ∠WUX is at point U, so it's an inscribed angle. The intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to angle U, i.e., arc WX that doesn't pass through U. But since W and X are points on the circle, and U is another point, the intercepted arc depends on the position of X.

Alternatively, maybe ∠WUX intercepts arc WX, but since U is on the circle, the angle is formed by chords UW and UX. So, the intercepted arc is arc WX that does not include U. Wait, but the measure of ∠WUX would be half the measure of arc WX. But earlier, we found that arc WX is 90°, so ∠WUX would be 45°, but that's not among the options. Hmm, this suggests an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I confused the intercepted arc. Let me think again. When you have an inscribed angle at point U, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing U. So, if points W and X are on the circle, then the angle ∠WUX intercepts arc WX. But if the arc WX is 90°, then ∠WUX would be half of that, which is 45°, but that's not matching the answer choices. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous steps.

Let me retrace. Earlier, I assumed that the measure of ∠VZU (which is 4x) corresponds to arc VU, and similarly ∠UZY (2x+24) corresponds to arc UY. Then, since arc VU + arc UY = arc VY = 180°, leading to 4x + (2x +24)= 180. Solving that gave x=26. Then, substituting back into equation (1): a + 3x = 168 => a = 90°. So arc WX is 90°, as per ∠WZX being a central angle. Then, inscribed angle over arc WX would be half of that, 45°, which is not in the options. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Where did I go wrong? Let me check the intercepted arcs again.

The angle ∠VZU is at the center Z, so it intercepts arc VU. Therefore, measure of ∠VZU is equal to the measure of arc VU. Similarly, ∠UZY is at center Z, so intercepts arc UY, hence measure is equal to arc UY. Thus, arc VU = 4x, arc UY = 2x +24, and their sum is 180°, which led us to x=26. That seems correct.

Then, arc WX is measured by ∠WZX, which is a central angle, so arc WX = a = 90°, as per earlier calculation.

But then, ∠WUX is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WX. So why is the answer not 45? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, but perhaps the intercepted arc for ∠WUX is not arc WX. Let me draw mentally: points W, U, X on the circle. The angle at U between W and X. So, the inscribed angle ∠WUX intercepts arc WX that does not contain U. But if arc WX is 90°, then the measure of ∠WUX would be half of that, 45°. However, 45 is not among the options. So, there must be a mistake in assuming that arc WX is 90°. Where is the mistake?

Wait, let me think again. The angles given at Z are:

- ∠WZX (central angle) intercepts arc WX. So measure of arc WX is equal to ∠WZX, which is a = 90°.

- ∠XZY (another central angle) intercepts arc XY. So arc XY = a = 90°.

- ∠VZU intercepts arc VU = 4x = 4*26 = 104°.

- ∠UZY intercepts arc UY = 2x +24 = 52 +24 = 76°.

So, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°, which adds to 180°, as before.

Now, the total circumference of the circle is 360°, so sum of all arcs:

arc WX + arc XY + arc VU + arc UY ?

Wait, but how do these arcs fit together? Let me think about the entire circle.

The circle is divided into arcs by points W, X, Y, V, U. But since WU and VY are diameters, points W and U are opposites, V and Y are opposites. Let me try to map the arcs:

Starting from point W:

- From W to X: arc WX = 90°.

- From X to Y: arc XY = 90°.

- From Y to V: arc YV = 180° (since VY is a diameter).

Wait, but that may not account for all arcs. Alternatively, perhaps there are overlapping arcs.

Alternatively, since arc VU is 104°, and arc UY is 76°, then from V to U is 104°, and from U to Y is 76°, making arc VY = 104 + 76 = 180°, which checks out.

Similarly, arc WX is 90°, arc XY is 90°, so from W to X to Y is 90 + 90 = 180°, implying that arc WY is 180°, which would mean that points W and Y are diametrically opposite. But wait, if WY is a diameter, but originally we have diameters WU and VY. So unless WY is another diameter, but that's not stated. So this suggests inconsistency.

Wait, if arc WX is 90°, arc XY is 90°, then arc WY is 180°, which implies that W and Y are endpoints of a diameter. But according to the given information, VY is a diameter. So if WY is also a diameter, then points W and Y would be endpoints of a diameter, which would imply that W and Y are diametrically opposite. But this contradicts the existence of diameter VY, unless V coincides with W, but that's not indicated.

This inconsistency suggests an error in my reasoning. What's wrong here?

Ah! Perhaps the arcs WX, XY, VU, and UY are not all distinct. Maybe some arcs overlap or are part of larger arcs. Let me try to think differently.

The sum of all angles around point Z is 360°, which includes angles ∠WZX, ∠XZY, ∠VZU, ∠UZY. But these angles are adjacent? Or are they overlapping?

For example, if we look at the full circle around Z, the angles at Z would cover the entire circle. Let me imagine rotating around Z: starting from W, going through X to Y, then through U to V, etc. But the exact arrangement depends on the positions of points X, V, U, Y.

Alternatively, since we have diameters WU and VY, which intersect at Z. Let me assume that diameters WU and VY are perpendicular, but that's not given. Alternatively, they form some angle θ between them.

But perhaps I can calculate the measure of arc WX, which is 90°, and arc XY is also 90°, totaling 180°, implying that points W and Y are diametrically opposite. If that's true, then arc WY is 180°, meaning that Y is the antipodal point of W. But since VY is a diameter, Y is the antipodal of V. So, if Y is antipodal to W, then V is antipodal to Y, which would make V antipodal to W. But this would imply that W and V are endpoints of the same diameter, which conflicts with WU and VY being separate diameters unless U and V coincide, which they aren't. So this suggests a contradiction.

This indicates that my assumption that ∠WZX and ∠XZY intercept arcs WX and XY respectively might be incorrect. Perhaps I misapplied the relationship between central angles and intercepted arcs.

Wait, let's revisit the definition. A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So, ∠WZX is a central angle, so it intercepts arc WX. Similarly, ∠XZY intercepts arc XY. Therefore, arc WX = ∠WZX = a, arc XY = ∠XZY = a.

Then, arc WX + arc XY = 2a. 

Additionally, arc VU = ∠VZU = 4x, arc UY = ∠UZY = 2x +24.

But since VY is a diameter, arc VY = 180°, so arc VU + arc UY = 180°, which gives us 4x + (2x +24) = 180 → x=26 as before.

So, arc WX = a = 90°, arc XY = 90°, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°.

Now, the total of these arcs is 90 + 90 + 104 + 76 = 360°, which matches the total circle. Wait, that sums to 360. So that works!

But how do these arcs fit into the circle? Let me think about the positions of points W, X, Y, V, U.

Starting from point W, moving along arc WX (90°) to X, then from X to Y along arc XY (90°), so total arc from W to Y is 180°, making W and Y endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, WY is a diameter. But in the given info, we have diameters WU and VY. So, if WY is a diameter, then Y is the antipodal point of W. Since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, which would make V the antipodal of W. So, V is the antipodal of W, and U is the antipodal of W? No, because WU is a diameter, so U is the antipodal of W. Therefore, if V is also antipodal to W, then V and U would be the same point, which is impossible. Contradiction again. So, there must be something wrong.

Wait, but if arc WY is 180°, then Y is the antipodal of W. But since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, so V is the antipodal of the antipodal of W, which brings us back to W. So V would be W, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that my assumption that arc WX and arc XY are both 90° is incorrect. But where is the error?

Wait, the sum of the arcs from the angles at Z is 90 + 90 + 104 + 76 = 360°, which is correct. But how do these arcs fit into the circle? They must overlap or be parts of larger arcs. Perhaps some of these arcs are overlapping or are parts of other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe some of these arcs are not distinct. For example, arc VU and arc UY are parts of the diameter VY. Arc WX and arc XY are parts of another arc. But if arc WX is 90°, and arc XY is 90°, then arc WY is 180°, as before. So, if WY is a diameter, then Y is the antipodal of W. But since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, which is W. So V is W, which is not allowed. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption that arc WX and arc XY are both 90° is wrong. But why?

Wait, perhaps the angles at Z are not covering the entire circle. Wait, the sum of the angles at Z is 360°, which is correct. But the arcs they intercept might not cover the entire circle. For example, if some arcs are overlapping or if there are other arcs not accounted for. But in reality, the angles at Z are covering the entire circle. So, the sum of their intercepted arcs must be 360°, which they are.

So, even though this creates a contradiction with the diameters, it's mathematically consistent. Perhaps the issue is that points X and V are positioned such that WY is a diameter, and V is a different point. Let me try to imagine this.

Assume that WY is a diameter (since arc WY is 180°). Then, since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, which is W. But this would imply that V=W, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the logic.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the direction of the arcs. Let me think again. If arc WX is 90°, arc XY is 90°, then arc WY is 180°, making WY a diameter. But since VY is a diameter, and Y is on that diameter, then V is the other end of the diameter from Y. So, if Y is the antipodal of W, then V is the antipodal of Y, which is the same as the antipodal of W's antipodal, which is W itself. Hence, V=W, which is invalid. Therefore, this suggests that my earlier conclusion that arc WX and arc XY are 90° each is wrong.

But where is the mistake? Let me go back.

Earlier, I said that the sum of the measures of the angles at Z is 360°, which equals the sum of the measures of their intercepted arcs. But perhaps some of these arcs overlap or are parts of the same diameter.

Wait, the angles at Z are:

- ∠WZX: intercepts arc WX.

- ∠XZY: intercepts arc XY.

- ∠VZU: intercepts arc VU.

- ∠UZY: intercepts arc UY.

But these arcs might overlap. For example, arc VU and arc UY are parts of diameter VY. Arc WX and arc XY are parts of another diameter or other arcs. But since WY is 180°, and VY is another diameter, perhaps the arcs WX and XY are parts of the circle that don't interfere with VY.

But regardless, the mathematical calculation shows that the sum of the arcs is 360°, and the individual arcs are 90°, 90°, 104°, 76°, which sum to 360. So, mathematically, this holds.

But the contradiction arises when trying to visualize the placement of points. This suggests that perhaps the error is in assuming that ∠WZX and ∠XZY are both central angles intercepting arcs WX and XY. Let me verify this.

Yes, since Z is the center, any angle at Z with vertices at Z and two points on the circle is a central angle, so its measure equals the arc it intercepts. So, ∠WZX is a central angle intercepting arc WX, and ∠XZY is a central angle intercepting arc XY. So, their measures are equal to the respective arcs.

Thus, the arcs WX and XY are 90° each. So, arc WX = 90°, arc XY = 90°, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°. Total 360°.

Now, to resolve the contradiction about WY being a diameter, perhaps point X is positioned such that it's not between W and Y, but on the other side. For example, if arc WX is 90°, and arc XY is 90°, but in the opposite direction. Let me think: if we go from W to X clockwise, arc WX is 90°, and from X to Y clockwise is another 90°, making W to Y clockwise 180°, hence WY is a diameter. But if we consider counterclockwise, it might be different. However, this still implies that W and Y are endpoints of a diameter.

But since VY is a diameter, then Y is the antipodal of V. So, if WY is a diameter, then V is the antipodal of Y, which is W. Hence, V=W, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be a flaw in this reasoning.

Wait, maybe the issue is that I'm assuming that the arcs WX and XY are both in the same direction. Perhaps they're in opposite directions. For example, arc WX could be 90° in one direction, and arc XY in the other. Let me try to think in terms of directions.

Imagine the circle with center Z. Let's fix W at (1,0) and U at (-1,0), making WU a horizontal diameter. Let's say V is at (0,1), Y is at (0,-1), making VY a vertical diameter. Now, where is point X?

If arc WX is 90°, then point X would be at (0,1), which is point V. But then ∠XZY would be ∠VZY, which would be a central angle from V to Y, which is 180°, but we said it's 90°. This doesn't align.

Alternatively, if arc WX is 90°, then X is at (0,1) or (0,-1)? Let me calculate. If W is at (1,0), then moving 90° counterclockwise along the circle would bring us to (0,1). So, X would be at (0,1), which is point V. But then, arc XY would be from X (V) to Y (which is (0,-1)). The arc from V to Y is 180°, but we said it's 90°, which contradicts. Hence, this suggests that placing X at V is not correct.

Alternatively, if arc WX is 90°, then X is at (0,1), and arc XY is 90°, so from X to Y would require moving another 90°, which would take us to (-1,0), which is point U. But then Y would be at (-1,0), but Y is supposed to be at (0,-1). This doesn't fit.

Hmm, this suggests that my earlier assumption about the intercepted arcs might be incorrect. Perhaps the angles at Z do not directly intercept the arcs I thought.

Wait, let's reconsider: ∠WZX is at point Z, with segments ZW and ZX. So, the intercepted arc is the arc from W to X that does not contain Z. Wait, but since Z is the center, the arc WX is the one that goes around the circle, not passing through Z. So, yes, it's the arc WX, and its measure is equal to the central angle ∠WZX.

Similarly, ∠XZY is at Z, with segments ZX and ZY, so it intercepts arc XY. 

But if we have arc WX = 90°, arc XY = 90°, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°, then the total is 360°. But how do these arcs fit into the circle? Let's try to visualize:

Start at W, move 90° to X, then from X move 90° to Y, then from Y move 76° to U, then from U move 104° to V, and then from V back to W? Wait, but VY is a diameter, so arc VY should be 180°. Let me check:

From V to Y is arc VY = arc VU + arc UY = 104° + 76° = 180°, which is correct. 

From W to X is 90°, from X to Y is 90°, so from W to Y is 180°, making WY a diameter. So, Y is the antipodal of W. But since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, which is W. So V is W, which is not allowed. Hence, this is impossible. 

This suggests that there's an error in the assumption that arc WX and arc XY are 90° each. But how? Where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the angles at Z are not all distinct. For example, ∠WZX and ∠XZY might overlap with other angles. Or perhaps the arcs are not all unique. Let me think: if arc WX is 90°, arc XY is 90°, then arc WY is 180°, making WY a diameter. But since VY is a diameter, and Y is on that diameter, then V is the antipodal of Y. So, if Y is the antipodal of W, then V is the antipodal of Y, which is W. Hence, V=W, which is impossible. So, this suggests that my earlier calculation is wrong, but how?

Wait, perhaps the measure of ∠WZX is not equal to arc WX. Let me double-check the central angle theorem: the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Yes, that's correct. So, if ∠WZX is a central angle, then it should equal arc WX.

But if this leads to a contradiction, then there must be an error in the initial setup. Let me review the problem statement again.

The problem states:

- WU and VY are diameters of circle Z.

- Angles at Z: ∠WZX, ∠XZY, ∠VZU, ∠UZY.

- ∠WZX ≅ ∠XZY.

- m∠VZU = 4x.

- m∠UZY = 2x + 24.

- Sum of all four angles is 360°.

I solved for x=26, a=90°, leading to arc WX = 90°, arc XY = 90°, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°, totaling 360°. But this leads to WY being a diameter, causing V to coincide with W, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's re-express the sum of the angles. The sum of the measures of the four angles at Z is 360°, which is correct. But maybe some of these angles are not all distinct. For example, ∠VZU and ∠UZY might be part of the same arc.

Wait, but ∠VZU is at Z, between V and U, so it intercepts arc VU. ∠UZY is at Z, between U and Y, so it intercepts arc UY. These are separate.

But if arc VU is 104°, arc UY is 76°, then arc VY is 180°, as expected. Arc WX is 90°, arc XY is 90°, so arc WY is 180°. So, WY is a diameter, and VY is another diameter. So, if WY is a diameter, then Y is the antipodal of W. And V is the antipodal of Y, so V is the antipodal of W, which would mean V is U? No, because U is the antipodal of W, since WU is a diameter. So, if V is the antipodal of Y, and Y is the antipodal of W, then V is the antipodal of W, which is U. Hence, V=U, which is not possible. This suggests that my calculation is wrong, but how?

Wait, perhaps the error is in assuming that ∠WZX and ∠XZY are both central angles. Are they? Let me confirm: Z is the center, so any angle at Z with two points on the circle is a central angle. So, yes, ∠WZX and ∠XZY are central angles, so their measures equal the arcs they intercept.

But this leads to the contradiction. Hence, perhaps the problem is in the interpretation of the angles. Let me check if ∠WZX is actually a central angle. If Z is the center, then yes. But maybe Z is not the center? Wait, the problem says Circle(Z), so Z is the name of the circle, not the center. Wait, this is a critical misunderstanding!

Oh my goodness! I assumed that Z is the center, but the problem says Circle(Z), which typically means the circle is named Z, and the center is another point. Wait, but in standard notation, circles are named by their center. So, if the circle is named Z, then Z is the center. But maybe in this problem, Z is just a label for the circle, and the actual center is a different point? Or perhaps Z is the center? This is ambiguous, but the problem uses Z as the circle, so likely Z is the center. But if that's the case, then the previous contradiction remains.

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Circle(Z)
Point(W)
Point(X)
Point(Y)
Point(U)
Point(V)
Line(W,U)
Line(V,Y)
IsDiameterOf(Line(W,U), Circle(Z))
IsDiameterOf(Line(V,Y), Circle(Z))
Angle(W,Z,X)
Angle(X,Z,Y)
Angle(V,Z,U)
Angle(U,Z,Y)
Congruent(Angle(W,Z,X), Angle(X,Z,Y))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V,Z,U)), 4*x)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(U,Z,Y)), 2*x + 24)
SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(W,Z,X)), MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,Y)), MeasureOf(Angle(V,Z,U)), MeasureOf(Angle(U,Z,Y)), 360)"

So, Circle(Z) is the circle named Z. The points W, X, Y, U, V are points on the circle. Line(W,U) is a diameter of Circle(Z), so W and U are endpoints of a diameter of the circle. Same with Line(V,Y). So, the center of the circle is the midpoint of WU and also the midpoint of VY. But the problem does not explicitly state that Z is the center. Wait, this is a critical oversight!

I assumed Z is the center, but the problem states Circle(Z), which means the circle is named Z, and its center is some point, possibly not named Z. Wait, but in standard notation, a circle is named by its center. So, if the circle is named Z, then Z is the center. But this would mean that Z is both a point (the center) and the circle. But in the problem, Z is used as a point in the Angle(W,Z,X), etc. So, Z is both the circle and a point? That doesn't make sense. This suggests that there is a naming convention issue.

Wait, perhaps Z is the center of the circle. So, Circle(Z) means the circle with center Z. Then, points W, X, Y, U, V are on the circle. Line(W,U) is a diameter, so W and U are endpoints of a diameter, passing through Z (the center). Similarly for Line(V,Y). 

With this understanding, the previous contradiction still exists. Let me try again with this corrected understanding.

So, Z is the center of the circle. Lines WU and VY are diameters, passing through Z. So, Z is the midpoint of WU and VY.

Now, the angles at Z are:

- ∠WZX: at point Z, between W and X. So, this is a central angle, intercepting arc WX.

- ∠XZY: at point Z, between X and Y. Central angle, intercepting arc XY.

- ∠VZU: at point Z, between V and U. Central angle, intercepting arc VU.

- ∠UZY: at point Z, between U and Y. Central angle, intercepting arc UY.

So, the measures of these angles are equal to the measures of their intercepted arcs.

As before, the sum of these angles is 360°, so the sum of the arcs is 360°.

We have:

arc WX = m∠WZX = a

arc XY = m∠XZY = a

arc VU = m∠VZU = 4x

arc UY = m∠UZY = 2x + 24

And arc VU + arc UY = arc VY = 180°, since VY is a diameter.

So, 4x + 2x + 24 = 180 → 6x = 156 → x = 26.

Then, a + 3x = 168 → a = 168 - 3*26 = 168 - 78 = 90.

So, arc WX = 90°, arc XY = 90°, arc VU = 104°, arc UY = 76°.

Now, the total of these arcs is 90 + 90 + 104 + 76 = 360°, which is correct.

Now, the issue of WY being a diameter: arc WX + arc XY = 90 + 90 = 180°, so arc WY = 180°, making WY a diameter. So, Y is the antipodal point of W. Since VY is a diameter, V is the antipodal of Y, which is the same as the antipodal of W, so V is the same as U, since U is the antipodal of W (because WU is a diameter). Hence, V = U, which is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in the assumptions, but mathematically, the calculations are correct.

But this contradiction implies that the configuration is impossible, which is unlikely in a well-posed problem. Therefore, there must be an alternative interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the arcs
