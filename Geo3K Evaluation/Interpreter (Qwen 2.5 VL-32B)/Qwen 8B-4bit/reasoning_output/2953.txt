<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several given predicates about points and angles, and we need to find the measure of angle 3. Wait, but first I should make sure I understand the setup correctly.

First, looking at the predicates. There are points A, B, C, D. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, CA form a triangle ABC. Then there's a point D connected via line BD. Also, various angles are mentioned. Let me list out all the given angle measures:

- Angle at B in triangle ABC: ∠ABC is 45 degrees? Wait, the predicates say MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals 45. Wait, angle ABC would be angle at B, so that's ∠ABC = 45°. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) is 40°, which would be angle at C, so ∠BCA = 40°. And MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) is 70°, which is angle at A, so ∠BAC = 70°. 

Wait, hold on. In triangle ABC, the sum of angles should be 180°. Let me check if these add up. 45 + 40 + 70 = 155°? That doesn't add up to 180. Wait, maybe I misread the order. Let me double-check. 

The angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B, formed by points A-B-C. So yes, that's ∠ABC. Similarly, angle(B,C,A) is ∠BCA (at point C), and angle(C,A,B) is ∠BAC (at point A). So adding those three angles: 45 + 40 + 70 = 155°, which contradicts the triangle angle sum. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Or perhaps there's something wrong with the problem setup?

Wait, but maybe the given angles are not all part of triangle ABC? Wait, but the predicates also mention other angles involving point D. For example, angle(A,B,D) is 45°, which is angle at B between A and D. Then there's angle(B,D,C), angle(D,C,A), angle(D,A,B), etc. So maybe triangle ABC isn't a standard triangle because some of its angles don't add up. But that seems impossible. Wait, unless there's a typo in my understanding. Let me re-examine the angle measures.

Given:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 45 → ∠ABC = 45°

MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) = 40 → ∠BCA = 40°

MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 70 → ∠BAC = 70°

So adding them up: 45 + 40 + 70 = 155°, which is not 180. That suggests either a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, maybe one of these angles is not part of triangle ABC. Wait, but the Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A) imply that ABC is a triangle. So why does the sum not add up? Maybe there's an error in the problem statement, but since it's given, I have to work with it. Or perhaps I misread the angle measures. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not all internal angles of triangle ABC. Wait, but angle(C,A,B) is ∠BAC, which is the angle at A. So if those three angles are supposed to be the angles of triangle ABC, they don't add up. Therefore, perhaps there's another structure here. Wait, but the problem mentions other points and angles involving D. Maybe triangle ABC is not a simple triangle? Or maybe there's a different configuration. 

But moving forward, even though the sum of angles in triangle ABC seems off, perhaps there's more to it. Let me note down the given angles:

In triangle ABC:

∠ABC = 45°, ∠BCA = 40°, ∠BAC = 70°. Wait, but 45+40+70=155. So missing 25 degrees. That suggests that maybe the triangle isn't a normal Euclidean triangle, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps one of the angles is not part of triangle ABC. Wait, but the Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A) define triangle ABC. So all three angles should be part of it. This inconsistency needs to be resolved somehow.

Wait, maybe the given angles aren't all the angles of triangle ABC. Because, for instance, the angle(A,B,D) is 45°, which is a different angle. So perhaps some of the angles given are not part of triangle ABC. Wait, but angle(A,B,C) is part of triangle ABC. Similarly, angle(B,C,A) and angle(C,A,B) are parts of triangle ABC. Therefore, their sum should be 180°, but according to the given, they sum to 155°. That's conflicting. Unless the problem has a typo, but assuming the problem is correct, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me recalculate: 45 (from Angle(A,B,C)) + 40 (Angle(B,C,A)) + 70 (Angle(C,A,B))? No, wait, that's 45 + 40 = 85, plus 70 gives 155. Yes, that's correct. So that's a problem. However, since the problem includes other angles involving point D, maybe there's a way around this. Perhaps triangle ABC is not a flat triangle? But in standard Euclidean geometry, that's impossible. So maybe there's an error in the problem, but since we have to proceed, perhaps the given angles are not all the angles of triangle ABC. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not all the internal angles. Wait, but angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B, which is an internal angle. Similarly for others. So that's confusing. But let's set that aside for a moment and look at the other given information.

Other angles:

Angle(A,B,D) = 45°, which is the angle at B between points A and D.

Then, SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,C,A)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B))) Equals(180).

So that sum is 180°. Since MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) is 70°, then the sum of the other two angles (Angle(B,D,C) and Angle(D,C,A)) is 180 - 70 = 110°.

Also, SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B))) Equals(180).

Again, MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) is 70°, so the sum of Angle(A,B,D) and Angle(D,A,B) is 180 - 70 = 110°. Given that Angle(A,B,D) is 45°, then MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)) would be 110 - 45 = 65°. So ∠ABD is 65°? Wait, angle(D,A,B) is at point A between points D and B. So ∠BAD = 65°? Let me clarify.

Let me try to visualize this. Points A, B, C forming triangle ABC with given angles. Point D connected to B. So BD is a line from B to D. Now, angles involving D:

Angle(A,B,D) is at point B, between A and D. So ∠ABD = 45°. Then angle(D,A,B) is at point A between D and B, which is ∠BAD = 65° as per the second sum. So that would mean that in triangle ABD, we have angles at B (45°), at A (65°), so the third angle at D would be 180 - 45 - 65 = 70°. So ∠ADB = 70°. But I don't know if that helps yet.

Now, looking back at the first sum: Sum of ∠BDC, ∠DCA, and ∠CAB = 180°. Wait, ∠CAB is 70°, so ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°. Let me see. ∠DCA is part of triangle DCA? Or maybe ∠DCA is angle at point C between points D and A. So ∠DCA is adjacent to ∠BCA (which was given as 40°). If we consider point D somewhere such that CD forms a line from C to D, then ∠DCA is part of that. 

But how do these angles relate? Let me think. If we have point D connected to B and C, then perhaps D lies somewhere such that lines BD and CD form certain angles. 

But perhaps we can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the angles sum to 155°, which is inconsistent. But maybe there's an external point D creating some other structures. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem. For example, perhaps one of the angle measures is incorrect. But since we have to proceed, let's assume that the given data is correct and try to find relations.

Another thing: the angles involving D. We found that ∠ABD = 45°, ∠BAD = 65°, leading to ∠ADB = 70°. Also, from the first sum, ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°. Also, ∠DCA is part of the angle at C in triangle ABC, which was given as ∠BCA = 40°. So if ∠BCA is 40°, and ∠DCA is some portion of that, depending on where D is located. For example, if D is on the same side as B relative to AC, then ∠DCA could be supplementary or something. But without knowing the position of D, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle BCD or something. But perhaps we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles. 

Wait, but maybe focusing on the angles. Let me consider triangle ABD. As before, angles at A, B, D are 65°, 45°, and 70°, respectively. Then, in triangle BCD, perhaps? Not sure yet. 

Looking at the first sum: ∠BDC + ∠DCA + ∠CAB = 180. We know ∠CAB is 70°, so ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°. Also, ∠DCA is part of ∠BCA (which is 40°). So if ∠BCA is split into ∠DCA and ∠DCB? Wait, if D is connected to C, then ∠BCA is adjacent to ∠DCA. Wait, if D is inside the triangle or outside? 

Assuming that D is positioned such that line BD splits the triangle ABC, but since there's a line BD, and a line DC, maybe D is outside the triangle. For example, suppose D is a point such that BD connects B to D, and CD connects C to D, making some angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps D is on the extension of BC or something. But without a diagram, it's challenging. 

But let's consider the angles again. Suppose that in triangle ABC, angle at C (∠BCA) is 40°, and ∠DCA is some part of that. If D is such that CD is extending from C in some direction, then ∠DCA could be part of that. For instance, if D is on the line CB extended beyond C, then ∠DCA would be 180° minus ∠BCA. But that depends on the location of D. 

Alternatively, maybe D is inside the triangle. But then ∠DCA would be less than ∠BCA. 

But perhaps there's another approach. Since we have ∠ABD = 45°, and in triangle ABD, ∠BAD = 65°, ∠ABD = 45°, so ∠ADB = 70°, as earlier. Now, if we can find other angles related to D. 

Also, there's angle(D,A,B) = 65°, which is ∠BAD = 65°, and angle(A,B,D) = 45°, so in triangle ABD, we have those. Now, looking at the other sum involving angle(B,D,C) and angle(D,C,A). Let's denote ∠BDC = x and ∠DCA = y. Then x + y = 110°. 

Additionally, if we can find relations between x and y. For example, if we consider triangle DBC or something. But to do that, we need more info. 

Wait, but maybe considering triangle ADC. If we can find some angles there. 

Alternatively, since we have point D connected to B and C, maybe considering triangle BDC. In triangle BDC, we have angle at B (∠DBC?), angle at D (∠BDC = x), and angle at C (∠BCD = ?). Wait, ∠BCD is related to ∠DCA (y)? 

Wait, ∠BCA is 40°, which is the angle at C in triangle ABC. If D is connected to C, then ∠BCA can be divided into ∠BCD and ∠DCA. So ∠BCD + ∠DCA = ∠BCA = 40°. Therefore, ∠BCD = 40° - y. 

So in triangle BDC, angles are:

At B: ∠CBD. What is that? Well, ∠ABC is 45°, and ∠ABD is 45°, so if D is on the same line as AB extended or something... Wait, no. Because ∠ABD is 45°, which is part of ∠ABC. Wait, original angle at B in triangle ABC is 45°, which is ∠ABC. If ∠ABD is also 45°, then point D lies along the extension of BA beyond A? Or maybe D is on the same line as AB but extended. Wait, because if D is such that BD forms an angle of 45° with AB, then D could be in various positions. 

Alternatively, maybe D is such that BD is a bisector or something. But given that ∠ABD is 45°, and ∠ABC is 45°, then BD coincides with BC? No, because ∠ABC is already 45°, and if BD is making the same angle, then D would lie on BC. But then angle(B,D,C) would be zero, which doesn't fit. So that suggests that D is not on BC. 

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the Law of Sines in some triangles. Let me try that.

In triangle ABD: angles are 45° at B, 65° at A, and 70° at D. So sides opposite these angles would be proportional. Let me assign labels:

Let’s denote AB = c, BD = a, AD = b. Then by Law of Sines:

a / sin(65°) = b / sin(45°) = c / sin(70°)

But without actual lengths, this may not directly help. However, maybe ratios can be used later.

Now, looking at triangle BDC. We need to find relations between angles. If we can find ∠CBD, then we can use the Law of Sines there. 

Earlier, we said that ∠ABC is 45°, and ∠ABD is 45°, implying that D lies along the extension of BA beyond A, making BD form a straight line with BA? Wait, no. If ∠ABD is 45°, then BD is making a 45° angle with AB. If AB is part of triangle ABC, which has ∠ABC = 45°, then BD could be a line from B making 45° with AB, which is the same as the angle of the triangle itself. That would suggest that D is along BC or something. Wait, if ∠ABD is equal to ∠ABC, then BD is overlapping with BC? But that would make D lie on BC. But then angle(B,D,C) would be zero, which conflicts with the sum needing to be 110°. So that can't be. 

Therefore, maybe D is not on BC. So ∠ABD = 45°, which is the same as ∠ABC = 45°, implies that BD is a line from B making the same angle as BC. Wait, but that would mean that D is in the same direction as BC. Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe D is such that BD is a reflection or something. 

This seems too vague. Let me think differently. 

We have two sums involving angles with D. From the first sum: ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°, and from the second sum: ∠ABD + ∠BAD = 110°, which we already determined. 

Since ∠ABD is 45°, and ∠BAD is 65°, adding to 110°. 

Now, perhaps there's a relationship between ∠BDC and ∠BAD? Or other angles. 

Alternatively, using the concept of exterior angles. For example, in triangle ABD, ∠ADB = 70°, which is an exterior angle to triangle DBC if D is outside. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe considering that ∠ADB = 70°, and if there's a relation between ∠ADB and ∠BDC. 

Wait, if we consider points A, D, C, and B, perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? But I don't know. 

Alternatively, since we have angles involving D, maybe applying the Law of Sines in triangles ABD, BDC, and ADC. 

For example, in triangle ABD, as above, with angles 45°, 65°, 70°. Let's say AB = c, BD = a, AD = b. Then:

a / sin(65°) = b / sin(45°) = c / sin(70°)

Similarly, in triangle BDC, if we can find some relations. Let's assume that in triangle BDC, we have angles at B, D, C. Let's call ∠BDC = x, ∠BCD = z, ∠CBD = w. Then x + z + w = 180°. Earlier, we had that z = 40° - y, where y = ∠DCA. Also, from the first sum, x + y = 110°, so x = 110° - y. 

Thus, substituting z = 40° - y into the equation for triangle BDC: x + z + w = 180 → (110 - y) + (40 - y) + w = 180 → 150 - 2y + w = 180 → w = 30 + 2y. 

Now, what is w? ∠CBD is w, which is the angle at B in triangle BDC. But ∠ABC is 45°, which is the angle at B in triangle ABC. How is ∠CBD related to ∠ABC? 

If D is positioned such that BD extends from B, then ∠CBD is part of ∠ABC or its supplement. For example, if D is inside the triangle, then ∠CBD would be part of ∠ABC. But since ∠ABC is 45°, and ∠CBD is w, then w could be less than or greater than 45°, depending on D's location. 

However, from earlier, we had that in triangle ABD, ∠ABD is 45°, which is the angle at B between A and D. So ∠ABD = 45°, which is the angle between BA and BD. But ∠ABC is the angle between BA and BC. So if BD is making the same angle as BC, then BD would coincide with BC, but that leads us back to the previous contradiction. 

Alternatively, if D is such that BD divides ∠ABC into two parts: ∠ABD and ∠DBC. Wait, that would make sense. So ∠ABC is composed of ∠ABD and ∠DBC. So ∠ABD + ∠DBC = ∠ABC. 

Given that ∠ABD is 45°, and ∠ABC is 45°, this would imply that ∠DBC = 0°, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction. This suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, but if ∠ABD is 45°, and ∠ABC is 45°, then D lies on the extension of BC such that BD is a straight line. Wait, no. If D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then ∠ABD would be larger than ∠ABC. Alternatively, if D is on the other side of AB, then ∠ABD could be smaller. 

This is getting really tangled. Maybe there's another approach. Let's revisit the given equations. 

From the second sum: ∠ABD (45°) + ∠BAD (65°) + ∠CAB (70°) = 180°, but wait, that's 45 + 65 + 70 = 180, which adds up to 180. Wait, that's correct! Wait, earlier I thought that ∠CAB is 70°, and the sum of ∠ABD, ∠BAD, and ∠CAB equals 180. So that works. So that means that those three angles form a straight line? No, because ∠ABD is at B, ∠BAD is at A, and ∠CAB is at A. Wait, this is confusing. 

Wait, the sum is MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180. Which translates to ∠ABD (at B) + ∠BAD (at A) + ∠BAC (at A) = 180. Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense geometrically. Wait, maybe the angles are part of a larger triangle or something. 

Wait, but if you have point D such that BD is drawn from B, and AD is drawn from A, then the angles at B and A would be parts of different triangles. But the sum being 180 suggests that these three angles are arranged in a way that their total is a straight line. 

Alternatively, maybe they're part of a triangle where the sum is 180. But I'm not seeing it. 

But regardless, since the sum is 180, and we've calculated that ∠ABD = 45°, ∠BAD = 65°, and ∠BAC = 70°, adding up to 180. Wait, but ∠BAC is part of triangle ABC, while ∠BAD is part of triangle ABD. How can they sum with ∠ABD to give 180? It suggests that these three angles are part of a larger triangle or some configuration. 

Perhaps D is placed such that AD and BD form a triangle with another point, but I'm not sure. 

Back to the main goal: finding the measure of ∠3. Wait, the question says "Find the measure of ∠3." But the problem didn't specify which angle is labeled as ∠3. This is a critical point. The initial problem mentions various angles like Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,A), etc., but it's unclear which of these corresponds to ∠3. However, the answer choices are A. 85, B. 90, C. 95, D. 105. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there are several angles mentioned: 

- Angle(A,B,C): 45°
- Angle(B,C,A): 40°
- Angle(C,A,B): 70°
- Angle(A,B,D): 45°
- Angle(B,D,C): ?
- Angle(D,C,A): ?
- Angle(D,A,B): 65° (as computed)
- Also, in the first sum: ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°, and in the second sum: ∠ABD + ∠BAD = 110°, which we've already used. 

Possibly, the question refers to one of the unlabeled angles, possibly ∠BDC or ∠DCA, or maybe another angle. But since the user hasn't specified which angle is ∠3, but the answer options are numerical, I need to infer which angle is being asked. 

Looking at the given angles, perhaps the question is referring to ∠BDC or ∠DCA. Alternatively, maybe ∠ADC or something else. But since the answer choices are given, and the options are around 85-105, let's think about the equations we have. 

From the first sum: ∠BDC + ∠DCA = 110°. Let's call ∠BDC = x, ∠DCA = y, so x + y = 110. 

Also, ∠BCA = 40°, which is the angle at C in triangle ABC. If ∠DCA is part of that, then y ≤ 40°, assuming D is inside the triangle. But if D is outside, then y could be greater than 40°. 

But earlier, we had that in triangle BDC, the angles are x, w, and z = 40 - y. And we had w = 30 + 2y. 

Also, from the earlier calculation, w = ∠CBD, which is part of ∠ABC = 45°. So if ∠CBD = w = 30 + 2y, and ∠ABC = 45°, then:

w + something = 45°? Wait, if D is positioned such that ∠CBD is part of ∠ABC, then ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠CBD. But ∠ABD is 45°, so:

∠ABD + ∠CBD = ∠ABC → 45° + w = 45° → w = 0°, which is impossible. So this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, if D is on the other side of AB, then ∠CBD could be a reflex angle, but that's unlikely. 

This suggests that there's an error in the assumptions. Perhaps the angle at B in triangle BDC is not ∠CBD but something else. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠CBD is not part of ∠ABC. If D is outside the triangle, then ∠CBD could be a separate angle. 

Let me try to imagine D being outside the triangle ABC. Let's say D is such that BD extends from B away from C, forming an angle of 45° with AB. Then, ∠ABD = 45°, which is the same as ∠ABC = 45°, suggesting that BD is aligned with BC, but then D would be on BC extended. 

If D is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠BCD would be 0°, and ∠DCA would be 180° - 40° = 140°, which would make x + y = 110°, so x = 110 - y. But if y = 140°, then x = -30°, which is impossible. So that doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if D is on the other side of B, extending BD away from C. Then, ∠ABD = 45°, and ∠CBD would be 180° - 45° = 135°, but this seems arbitrary. 

I think I'm stuck here. Let me focus on the equations I have. 

We have x + y = 110°, where x = ∠BDC and y = ∠DCA. 

Also, in triangle BDC, angles are x, w, z, where z = 40° - y, and w = 30 + 2y. 

But without knowing w, I can't proceed further. However, if I can relate w to something else. 

Wait, earlier I thought that w = ∠CBD, which is part of ∠ABC = 45°. But if that's not possible, perhaps there's another relation. 

Alternatively, if I consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have angles at A, D, and C. Let's denote ∠DAC = ?, ∠ADC = ?, ∠DCA = y. 

But we know ∠BAD = 65°, which is part of ∠BAC = 70°. So ∠DAC = ∠BAC - ∠BAD = 70° - 65° = 5°. 

So in triangle ADC, we have ∠DAC = 5°, ∠DCA = y, and ∠ADC = ?. The sum of these angles is 180°. So:

∠DAC + ∠DCA + ∠ADC = 180 → 5° + y + ∠ADC = 180 → ∠ADC = 175° - y. 

But ∠ADC is also related to other angles. For example, in triangle ABD, we found ∠ADB = 70°, which is the angle at D between A and B. Now, ∠ADC is the angle at D between A and C. Are these related? 

Yes! Because ∠ADB and ∠ADC are adjacent angles at point D. So ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180°, assuming that points B, D, and C are colinear. Wait, no. If D is connected to B and C, then ∠ADB and ∠ADC are not necessarily supplementary. 

Wait, but if D is connected to B and C, then at point D, the angles around D would depend on the configuration. For example, if D is connected to B and C, then ∠ADB and ∠ADC are angles at D, but unless B, D, C are colinear, they don't add up to anything specific. 

But if we consider that ∠ADB = 70° (from triangle ABD), and ∠ADC is part of triangle ADC, which is 175° - y. But unless there's a relation between these two angles, I can't combine them. 

Wait, but maybe there's a straight line through D? Like, if points B, D, and C are colinear, then ∠ADB and ∠ADC would be supplementary. But that would mean that ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180°. 

If that's the case, then:

70° + (175° - y) = 180° → 245° - y = 180° → y = 65°. 

Then, since x + y = 110°, x = 110° - y = 110° - 65° = 45°. 

So ∠BDC = x = 45°, and ∠DCA = y = 65°. 

But wait, earlier we had ∠BCA = 40°, which is the angle at C in triangle ABC. If y = ∠DCA = 65°, then ∠BCA = ∠BCD + ∠DCA = 40°. But if ∠DCA = 65°, then ∠BCD = 40° - 65° = -25°, which is impossible. So this suggests a contradiction. 

Ah, so the assumption that points B, D, C are collinear is invalid. Thus, this approach is flawed. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ∠DAC. Let me check again. 

We had ∠BAC = 70°, which is the angle at A in triangle ABC. ∠BAD = 65°, which is the angle at A between B and D. So ∠DAC = ∠BAC - ∠BAD = 70° - 65° = 5°, which is correct. 

So in triangle ADC, angles are 5°, y, and ∠ADC = 175° - y. 

But without knowing ∠ADC, I can't proceed. 

But if I assume that ∠ADB = 70°, and ∠ADC = 175° - y, then there's no direct relation unless D is on a particular line. 

Maybe there's another relation. Let's go back to the triangle BDC. We had:

x + z + w = 180°, where z = 40° - y, and w = 30 + 2y. 

So substituting:

x + (40 - y) + (30 + 2y) = 180 → x + 70 + y = 180 → x + y = 110°, which matches our earlier equation. So this doesn't provide new information. 

Thus, we need another equation to solve for x or y. 

Wait, but if we can find w, which is ∠CBD. How?

Earlier, we assumed that ∠ABC = 45°, and if ∠CBD is part of that, then ∠ABD + ∠CBD = ∠ABC. But earlier, this led to a contradiction. But maybe there's another way. 

Wait, if D is not on the same plane or something? No, that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if D is inside the triangle ABC, then ∠ABD is part of ∠ABC. So ∠ABD + ∠CBD = ∠ABC → 45° + w = 45° → w = 0°, which is impossible. 

Thus, this suggests that D is outside the triangle. If D is outside, then ∠ABD and ∠CBD could be on different sides. 

For example, if D is outside the triangle such that BD extends beyond A, then ∠ABD would be an external angle. Let me think. 

Suppose D is such that BD extends from B, passing through A and extending beyond. Then, ∠ABD would be the angle between BA and BD, which would be 180° minus ∠ABD. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles ABD and BDC. 

In triangle ABD, we have:

AB / sin(∠ADB) = BD / sin(∠BAD) = AD / sin(∠ABD)

Which is AB / sin(70°) = BD / sin(65°) = AD / sin(45°)

Let me denote AB = c, BD = a, AD = b. So:

c / sin(70°) = a / sin(65°) → a = c * sin(65°) / sin(70°)

Similarly, b = c * sin(45°) / sin(70°)

Now, in triangle BDC, using the Law of Sines:

BD / sin(∠BCD) = CD / sin(∠BDC) = BC / sin(∠CBD)

But we don't know BC or CD. However, we might relate BC to AB through triangle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, we have angles 45°, 40°, and 70°, but their sum is 155°, which is problematic. But let's proceed hypothetically. 

Using Law of Sines on triangle ABC:

AB / sin(∠BCA) = BC / sin(∠BAC) = AC / sin(∠ABC)

So AB / sin(40°) = BC / sin(70°) = AC / sin(45°)

Let me denote AB = c, BC = a', AC = b'. Then:

c / sin(40°) = a' / sin(70°) → a' = c * sin(70°) / sin(40°)

Similarly, b' = c * sin(45°) / sin(40°)

Now, returning to triangle BDC. If we can express BD in terms of c, and BC in terms of c, then maybe we can find relations. 

From earlier, BD = a = c * sin(65°) / sin(70°)

And BC = a' = c * sin(70°) / sin(40°)

So BD / BC = [sin(65°)/sin(70°)] / [sin(70°)/sin(40°)] = [sin(65°) * sin(40°)] / [sin²(70°)]

This ratio might be helpful if we can relate it to other parts of triangle BDC. 

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. 

Alternatively, let's assume some values. Let's choose c = AB = 1 for simplicity. 

So, AB = 1.

Then, in triangle ABC:

BC = sin(70°)/sin(40°) ≈ 0.9397 / 0.6428 ≈ 1.461

AC = sin(45°)/sin(40°) ≈ 0.7071 / 0.6428 ≈ 1.100

In triangle ABD:

BD = sin(65°)/sin(70°) ≈ 0.9063 / 0.9397 ≈ 0.964

AD = sin(45°)/sin(70°) ≈ 0.7071 / 0.9397 ≈ 0.753

Now, in triangle BDC, we have BD ≈ 0.964, BC ≈ 1.461, and we need to find relations between the angles. 

But without knowing CD or other sides, it's difficult. 

However, if we can relate ∠BCD and ∠BDC using the Law of Sines. 

In triangle BDC:

BD / sin(∠BCD) = BC / sin(∠BDC)

So:

BD / sin(z) = BC / sin(x), where z = ∠BCD = 40° - y, and x = ∠BDC = 110° - y.

Substituting:

BD / sin(40° - y) = BC / sin(110° - y)

Plugging in BD ≈ 0.964 and BC ≈ 1.461:

0.964 / sin(40° - y) = 1.461 / sin(110° - y)

Cross-multiplying:

0.964 * sin(110° - y) = 1.461 * sin(40° - y)

Let me compute this numerically. Let me denote θ = y. So:

0.964 * sin(110° - θ) = 1.461 * sin(40° - θ)

Let me expand sin(110° - θ) and sin(40° - θ):

Using sine subtraction formula:

sin(110° - θ) = sin(110°)cosθ - cos(110°)sinθ

sin(40° - θ) = sin40°cosθ - cos40°sinθ

But this might get too complex. Instead, let's try plugging in possible values for y from the answer choices. 

Wait, but we need to find y such that this equation holds. Let's assume that y is one of the angles that could lead to one of the answer choices. 

Alternatively, let's try to solve for θ numerically. 

Let me rearrange the equation:

sin(110° - θ) / sin(40° - θ) = 1.461 / 0.964 ≈ 1.516

So, sin(110° - θ) ≈ 1.516 * sin(40° - θ)

Let me try θ = 30°: 

Left: sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848

Right: 1.516 * sin(10°) ≈ 1.516 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.263

Not equal.

θ = 20°: 

Left: sin(90°) = 1

Right: 1.516 * sin(20°) ≈ 1.516 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.517

Nope.

θ = 10°: 

Left: sin(100°) ≈ 0.9848

Right: 1.516 * sin(30°) = 1.516 * 0.5 = 0.758

Still not matching.

θ = 45°: 

Left: sin(65°) ≈ 0.9063

Right: 1.516 * sin(-5°) ≈ 1.516 * (-0.0872) ≈ -0.132

Nope.

θ = 50°: 

Left: sin(60°) ≈ 0.8660

Right: 1.516 * sin(-10°) ≈ 1.516 * (-0.1736) ≈ -0.263

Nope.

θ = 60°: 

Left: sin(50°) ≈ 0.7660

Right: 1.516 * sin(-20°) ≈ 1.516 * (-0.3420) ≈ -0.517

Nope.

Hmm, none of these are working. Maybe my assumption about the value of BD and BC is incorrect due to the inconsistency in the original triangle ABC angles. 

Given that the original triangle ABC has angles summing to 155° instead of 180°, which is impossible, perhaps the problem has a typo, and one of the angle measures is incorrect. For example, if ∠BAC was meant to be 70°, ∠ABC 40°, and ∠BCA 70°, making a total of 180°. Or perhaps one of the other angles is different. 

But since we have to work with the given data, perhaps the intended answer is derived from the equations we have, despite the inconsistencies. 

Let me try to assume that the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180°, and see what that implies. 

If ∠ABC + ∠BCA + ∠BAC = 180°, then 45 + 40 + x = 180 → x = 95°. So ∠BAC = 95°, but the given is 70°. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but if we proceed with this corrected value, let's see. 

Assume that ∠BAC = 95°, then ∠BAD = 65°, so ∠DAC = 95° - 65° = 30°. 

Then in triangle ADC, angles are 30°, y, and ∠ADC = 150° - y. 

If we also assume that points B, D, C are collinear, then ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180°, giving 70° + (150° - y) = 180 → y = 40°. 

Then, from x + y = 110°, x = 70°. 

So ∠BDC = 70°, and ∠DCA = 40°. 

But ∠BCA = 40°, so ∠DCA = 40° implies that D is on BC extended such that CD is in the opposite direction, making ∠BCD = 0°, which is possible. 

But this is speculative, but if we follow this, then ∠BDC = 70°, which might be one of the answer choices. But 70° is not among the options. The options are 85,
