MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle M with several points and lines mentioned. The question is asking for the measure of arc HJ, given some other arcs and chord lengths. Let me start by recalling the given information and see how it connects.

First, the circle is named M, so all the points like F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P are on this circle. There are several lines and arcs mentioned. The key pieces of information here are:

- FL is a chord of the circle with length 24.
- HJ is another chord with length 48.
- The measure of arc HP is 65 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of arc HJ.

Also, there are some right angles mentioned: Angle at M between L and F is a right angle, same with angle at M between N and J. Also, ML and MN are radii because they're marked as IsRadiusOf. Since ML and MN are radii, their lengths should be equal. Wait, but FL is a chord of length 24. Maybe I can use the relationship between chord length and the subtended arc?

Let me recall that the length of a chord is related to the radius and the central angle. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. So if I know the chord length and the radius, I can find theta. But wait, do I know the radius? Or maybe relate different chords?

Wait, let's think about the chords FL and HJ. FL has length 24, HJ has length 48. That suggests that HJ is twice as long as FL. Since chord length depends on the sine of half the central angle, if one chord is twice as long as another, perhaps the central angle is double? Wait, no. Because chord length is proportional to sin(theta/2). So if chord length doubles, sin(theta/2) would also double? But since sine isn't linear, that doesn't directly translate. However, maybe there's a relation between the two chords.

Alternatively, maybe considering that FL and HJ are chords subtending certain arcs. Also, there's an arc HP measuring 65 degrees. Hmm. Let me check the given arcs again.

We have Arc(H,P,M) which is 65 degrees. So the arc from H to P passing through M is 65 degrees. Wait, but the points are labeled such that the arc is from H to P with center at M? No, arcs are typically parts of the circumference. Wait, maybe the arc HP is part of the circle, and the measure is 65 degrees. Then, since M is the center, maybe that arc corresponds to the central angle ∠HMP? Wait, if M is the center, then the central angle corresponding to arc HP would be ∠HMP. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Arc(H,P,M)) is 65. So that arc is 65 degrees, implying that the central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees.

Now, looking at the chords. For example, FL is a chord of length 24. Since ML and MN are radii, then ML = MN. Let me confirm: IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)) means ML is a radius. Similarly, Line(M,N) is a radius. Therefore, ML and MN are radii of the circle. So, the length of ML is equal to the radius r. Similarly, MN is also r.

Now, FL is a chord connecting points F and L. Since point F lies on the circle (PointLiesOnCircle(F)), and L is connected via line ML. Wait, point L is connected to M via Line(M,L), which is a radius. So point L is on the circle, and line ML is a radius. So FL is a chord from F to L, where L is a point on the circle such that ML is a radius. Similarly, HJ is a chord from H to J, with H and J being points on the circle.

But how does this connect to the arcs? Let's consider that FL is a chord with length 24, and HJ is a chord with length 48. Let me think about the relationship between chord length and the central angle. For a chord of length c, the formula is c = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So for FL, 24 = 2r sin(θ₁/2), and for HJ, 48 = 2r sin(θ₂/2). Dividing these equations gives 48/24 = sin(θ₂/2)/sin(θ₁/2), so 2 = sin(θ₂/2)/sin(θ₁/2). Therefore, sin(θ₂/2) = 2 sin(θ₁/2). 

But since the maximum value of sine is 1, this implies that θ₁/2 must be such that sin(θ₁/2) ≤ 0.5, because 2 times that would be up to 1. So θ₁/2 ≤ 30°, making θ₁ ≤ 60°, and θ₂/2 could be up to 90°, making θ₂ up to 180°. But without knowing the actual angles, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since FL and HJ are chords, maybe they correspond to arcs whose measures we can find. But how?

Another thing: there's an arc HP measuring 65 degrees. Given that H and P are points on the circle, and M is the center, so the arc HP corresponds to central angle ∠HMP = 65°. Now, looking at the points involved. There's also an arc HJ mentioned. Maybe there's a relationship between arcs HP and HJ?

Looking back at the given arcs: Arc(H,J,M) and Arc(H,P,M). Wait, the Arc(H,J,M) is mentioned as well. Wait, the Arc(H,J,M) – perhaps that's the arc from H to J passing through M? But M is the center, so that would imply that the arc is actually a straight line? Wait, no. Arcs are parts of the circumference. If the arc is denoted as HJM, that might mean the arc from H to J passing through M. But since M is the center, unless the arc passes through M, which is inside the circle, so that wouldn't make sense. Wait, maybe the notation Arc(H,J,M) refers to the arc starting at H, ending at J, with the center at M? That would be the arc that is opposite to the central angle ∠HJM? Wait, no. Typically, arcs are named by their endpoints and sometimes a third point if ambiguous. So Arc(H,J,M) likely represents the arc from H to J, with M being the center. Wait, but the center is M, so the arc HJ would correspond to the central angle ∠H MJ? Wait, no. If the arc is from H to J, then the central angle would be ∠H M J? Wait, no. The central angle for arc HJ would be the angle at the center M between points H and J. So the central angle ∠HMJ. So the measure of arc HJ would be equal to the measure of ∠HMJ.

Similarly, the arc HP is 65 degrees, so the central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees. Now, if we can find the measure of ∠HMJ, that would give us the measure of arc HJ.

So how can we find ∠HMJ? Let's look at the other information.

We know that FL is a chord of length 24. Since ML is a radius, and FL is a chord, we can consider triangle MFL. Since ML is a radius, say length r, and MF is also a radius (since F is on the circle). Wait, yes! Point F is on the circle, so MF is a radius. Therefore, triangle MFL has sides MF and ML as radii, each of length r. Therefore, triangle MFL is an isosceles triangle with MF = ML = r, and base FL = 24. Additionally, we're told that angle at M, which is ∠FML, is a right angle. Wait, RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F))? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F)). Wait, angle at L? Wait, Angle(M,L,F) is the angle at point L between points M, L, F. Wait, but if L is a point on the circle, and ML is a radius, and FL is a chord. So the angle at L between M, L, F. Wait, but in triangle MFL, the angle at L would be... Wait, but if ML and LF are sides, but ML is a radius, and FL is a chord. How does that form a triangle? Let me visualize.

Points M (center), L (on the circle), F (another point on the circle). So ML and MF are both radii. So triangle MFL has ML=MF=r. But the angle at L is given as a right angle. Wait, that would make triangle MFL a right triangle with legs ML and LF? Wait, no. If angle at L is 90 degrees, then the triangle would have a right angle at L. But in that case, by Pythagoras, ML² + LF² = MF². But ML and MF are both radii, so ML = MF = r. Therefore, substituting, r² + LF² = r² → LF² = 0 → LF = 0, which is impossible. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe I misinterpreted the angle.

Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F)). So that's angle at L, formed by points M-L-F. But if that's a right angle, then triangle M-L-F has a right angle at L. Which, as above, leads to a contradiction unless LF is zero. So something's wrong here. Maybe the angle is not at L but at M? Wait, no. The notation Angle(M,L,F) means the angle at point L, with segments LM and LF. Wait, but if that angle is a right angle, then triangle M-L-F has a right angle at L. But that would require that ML ⊥ LF. But ML is a radius, and LF is a chord. So if ML is perpendicular to LF, then LF is tangent to the circle at L? Wait, no. Wait, if ML is perpendicular to LF, then LF would be tangent at L, but F is on the circle, so LF cannot be tangent. Therefore, this seems impossible. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the angle is not at L but at M? Wait, the standard notation is Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B. So Angle(M,L,F) is angle at L between points M, L, F. So that's definitely the angle at L. So why is that a right angle? This seems conflicting. Perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the diagram. Alternatively, perhaps the given information includes more elements.

Wait, there's also Line(F,L) which is a chord, and PointLiesOnCircle(F) and PointLiesOnCircle(L). So F and L are both on the circle. So ML is a radius (from M to L), and MF is also a radius (from M to F). Therefore, triangle MFL has two sides of length r (ML and MF) and the third side FL. If angle at L is a right angle, then by Pythagoras:

ML² + LF² = MF²

But ML = MF = r, so:

r² + LF² = r² ⇒ LF² = 0 ⇒ LF = 0, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the angle is not at L but somewhere else? Or maybe the notation was misread.

Wait, maybe the angle is at M? Like Angle(M,L,F) could be interpreted differently. Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(M,L,F) is the angle at L. Unless there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is at F? But that would be written as Angle(F,L,M). So maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem statement. It says:

"RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F))" — so the angle at L between M and F. But according to the previous logic, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in the problem? Or perhaps I've misapplied the concepts.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between ML and LF, but between other lines? Wait, the line is Line(F,L), which is the chord FL. And ML is another line. So angle at L between ML and FL. So if ML is a radius from center M to L, and FL is a chord from F to L. So ML is going from L to M, and FL is going from L to F. So those two lines meet at L. So if angle between ML and FL is a right angle, then ML ⊥ FL. Which would mean that FL is tangent to the circle at L. But F is on the circle, so FL is a chord, not a tangent. Hence, this seems impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, suggesting either a mistake in the problem or perhaps misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle is at M instead of L? Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:

"RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F))"

Which would be angle at L. Unless the notation is different. Alternatively, maybe the angle is between lines ML and MF? But that would be angle at M. Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the notation. Maybe the angle is at M, between L and F? That is, Angle(M,L,F) is intended to be the angle at M between lines ML and MF. But that would be written as Angle(L,M,F), not Angle(M,L,F). 

This seems like a critical ambiguity. Assuming that the angle is supposed to be at M, then we have a right angle at M between ML and MF. But since ML and MF are both radii, the angle between them would be the central angle between points L and F. So if that angle is 90 degrees, then the arc LF would be 90 degrees. But how does that relate to the rest?

Alternatively, if the angle is at M, then the angle between ML and MF is 90 degrees. Then, since ML and MF are radii, that would mean that the arc from L to F is 90 degrees. But how does that help us with the other info?

But earlier, we had FL = 24. If the arc LF is 90 degrees, then the chord FL would have length 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is 90 degrees. So FL = 2r sin(45°) = 2r*(√2/2) = r√2. So FL = r√2. Given that FL is 24, then r = 24 / √2 = 12√2 ≈ 16.97. 

Then, for the chord HJ of length 48, which would be 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle for arc HJ. So 48 = 2r sin(θ/2). Substituting r = 12√2:

48 = 2*(12√2)*sin(θ/2) => 48 = 24√2 * sin(θ/2) => sin(θ/2) = 48/(24√2) = 2/√2 = √2 ≈ 1.414. But sine cannot exceed 1. This is impossible. Hence, contradiction again.

Therefore, this suggests that my assumption about the angle being at M is incorrect. But the original notation says Angle(M,L,F), which should be angle at L. Hence, there's a contradiction, which indicates that perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the setup.

Wait, but the problem comes from a system where the predicates are given, and we must take them as true. So even if there's a contradiction in the real-world geometry, we must work within the given data. Perhaps the angle being right is part of the configuration despite seeming impossible. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the diagram includes more elements. For instance, there's also Line(H,J), which is a chord of the circle, and Arc(H,J,M) is mentioned. Also, Arc(H,P,M) is 65 degrees. So maybe points H, J, P are arranged around the circle with certain relations.

Given that, let's focus on the arc HP being 65 degrees. Since M is the center, the central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees. Also, there's an arc HJ which we need to find. 

Additionally, there's a chord HJ of length 48. Let's assume that the central angle for arc HJ is θ, so the chord length HJ = 2r sin(θ/2) = 48. 

Earlier, we tried to find r from FL=24. But if we assume that the angle at L is right, leading to some inconsistency, maybe we need to proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that arc HP is 65 degrees, and there's a relationship between arcs HP and HJ through other chords or angles. 

Alternatively, since there are two chords, FL and HJ, with lengths 24 and 48, respectively, and possibly related to other arcs. Also, note that FL is a chord with midpoint at L? Not sure. Wait, FL is a chord from F to L, and ML is a radius. So if we consider triangle MFL, which has sides ML and MF as radii, and FL as the chord. If there's a right angle at L, then as before, this would lead to FL = 0, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that maybe the angle is at M. Let me try assuming that the angle at M between L and F is a right angle, i.e., ∠FML is 90 degrees. Wait, that would be angle at M between F and L. 

Wait, if the angle at M between F and L is 90 degrees, then the arc FL would be 90 degrees. Then, the chord FL would be 2r sin(45°) = r√2. Given FL = 24, then r = 24 / √2 = 12√2. Then, for chord HJ of length 48, we'd have 48 = 2r sin(θ/2), so sin(θ/2) = 48/(2*12√2) = 48/(24√2) = 2/√2 = √2, which is still impossible. So this doesn't work. 

Hmm. Maybe there's another approach. Since the arc HP is 65 degrees, and HJ is another arc, maybe there's a way to relate them through inscribed angles or other arcs. Let's think about the positions of the points.

Assuming M is the center. Points H and P are on the circle, with arc HP = 65 degrees. So the central angle ∠HMP = 65 degrees. Now, what about the arc HJ? Let's suppose that the central angle ∠H MJ is what we need to find. 

If we can find the measure of ∠H MJ, then that's the measure of arc HJ. To find ∠H MJ, perhaps we can find relationships involving other arcs or angles.

Alternatively, since there's a chord HJ of length 48, and we might relate its central angle to the radius. Let's denote the central angle for arc HJ as α. So, chord length HJ = 2r sin(α/2) = 48. Similarly, for chord FL = 24 = 2r sin(β/2), where β is the central angle for arc FL. 

But we don't know β yet. However, if we can find a relation between α and β, or find r from other information.

Wait, but earlier attempts to find r led to contradictions. Perhaps there's a different way. Let's look at other given arcs. There's Arc(H,P,M) = 65 degrees. What about other arcs? Are there any other arcs or relationships that can help us?

There's also the arc HJ mentioned. Let me think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360 degrees. If we can express some arcs in terms of others.

But without knowing the positions of all points, it's hard to tell. Let me think about the points involved. Points H, J, P are on the circle. Arc HP is 65 degrees. If we can find the relationship between HJ and HP.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle or other shape involving these points. For example, if we consider triangle MPH or something. But without knowing more, it's tricky.

Wait, there's also the fact that FL is a chord of length 24, and ML is a radius. Earlier, we thought about triangle MFL having a right angle at L, which seems problematic. But maybe there's another way. Suppose that the right angle is at M. Then, angle at M between F and L is 90 degrees, making arc FL = 90 degrees. Then, chord FL = 2r sin(45) = r√2 = 24. So r = 24 / √2 = 12√2. Then, for chord HJ = 48, which is 2r sin(α/2) = 48. Plugging in r:

2*(12√2)*sin(α/2) = 48  
=> 24√2 * sin(α/2) = 48  
=> sin(α/2) = 48 / (24√2) = 2 / √2 = √2. Again, impossible.

So this suggests that the assumption about the right angle is incorrect. Perhaps the angle is not related to FL but to other elements?

Wait, the problem mentions RightAngle(Angle(M,N,J)) as well. So similarly, there's a right angle at N between M and J. Let me think about that. Line(M,N) is a radius, and Line(J,P) is a chord. So, similar to the earlier case, if there's a right angle at N between M and J, then triangle MNJ has a right angle at N. Again, this would suggest that NJ is tangent to the circle at N, but J is on the circle, so NJ is a chord. Contradiction again.

This seems to indicate that there's a fundamental issue with the given predicates, as they lead to contradictions. But since this is a problem posed for solving, perhaps the error is in my interpretation of the angle notation. Let me revisit the problem statement.

Original problem: "RightAngle(Angle(M,L,F))" and "RightAngle(Angle(M,N,J))". These are the two right angles mentioned. Let me consider that maybe these are not angles at L and N, but at M. For example, Angle(M,L,F) being a right angle at M. But how?

If the angle is at M, then it would be the angle between lines ML and MF. So, ∠LMF is a right angle. Which would mean that ML ⊥ MF. Since ML and MF are both radii, this would mean that the angle between them is 90 degrees, so arc LF is 90 degrees. Then, as before, chord FL = 2r sin(45) = r√2 = 24, giving r = 12√2. Then, for HJ = 48, which would be 2r sin(α/2) = 48, leading to sin(α/2) = √2, which is impossible. 

But maybe there's another approach. Since arc HP is 65 degrees, and HJ is another arc. Let's assume that points H, J, P are positioned such that arc HP is 65 degrees, and we need to find arc HJ. Perhaps there's a relationship between arc HP and arc HJ through other elements.

Wait, there's an arc HJ and an arc HP. If we can find the measure of arc HJ by relating it to arc HP and other arcs. For example, if points H, J, P are arranged such that arc HJ plus arc JP equals arc HP, or something like that. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since there's a chord HJ of length 48, and arc HP of 65 degrees. Maybe we can find the radius from the arc HP. Since arc HP is 65 degrees, the chord length HP can be found using the chord length formula. Let's calculate that.

For arc HP of 65 degrees, the chord length HP = 2r sin(65/2) = 2r sin(32.5°). But we don't know HP's length. However, maybe there's a way to relate it to other chords.

Alternatively, since we have FL = 24 and HJ = 48, and if we can find the ratio between their central angles. Let's assume that FL corresponds to central angle β and HJ corresponds to α. From the chord length formula:

FL = 2r sin(β/2) = 24  
HJ = 2r sin(α/2) = 48  

Dividing the second equation by the first:

(2r sin(α/2)) / (2r sin(β/2)) = 48/24 = 2  
→ sin(α/2) / sin(β/2) = 2  

So sin(α/2) = 2 sin(β/2). 

But since the maximum value of sine is 1, this implies that sin(β/2) ≤ 0.5, so β/2 ≤ 30°, hence β ≤ 60°. Then, sin(α/2) = 2 sin(β/2) ≤ 2 * 0.5 = 1, so α/2 ≤ 90°, hence α ≤ 180°. 

But without knowing β, we can't find α directly. However, perhaps β is related to the arc HP of 65 degrees. Let me think.

If there's a connection between β and the arc HP. For example, if arc HP is part of the same diagram as arc FL. But without more information, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between arc HP (65°) and arc HJ. If points H, J, and P are arranged such that arc HJ and arc JP add up to arc HP, or something like that. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's unclear.

Wait, there's also the arc HJ and arc HP. Let me consider the entire circle. If arc HP is 65°, and arc HJ is what we need to find, perhaps there's another arc that relates to these. For example, if points J and P are related through another arc.

Alternatively, since there's a chord HJ and an arc HP, maybe we can find the central angle for arc HJ by considering triangle HJP or something. But without knowing other angles or sides, this is difficult.

Wait, let's think about the arc HP being 65°, and the chord HP. If we can find the length of HP, then we can relate it to the radius. Let's attempt that. 

HP = 2r sin(65°/2) = 2r sin(32.5°). But we don't know HP's length. However, maybe there's a way to relate HP to other chords. For example, if HP is part of triangle HPM, where M is the center. Since H and P are on the circle, MH and MP are radii, so triangle HMP is an isosceles triangle with sides MH = MP = r, and angle at M of 65°. Thus, the base angles at H and P are (180-65)/2 = 57.5° each. But how does this help us?

Unless there's another triangle involving HJ. For example, if J is related to P or H. But without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Maybe there's a property I'm missing. Let me recall that in a circle, if two chords intersect, the products of their segments are equal. But I don't see intersecting chords here.

Alternatively, since we have two chords, FL and HJ, with lengths 24 and 48, and arc HP = 65°, maybe there's a way to relate their central angles. Let me go back to the earlier equation: sin(α/2) = 2 sin(β/2). If I can find β, then I can find α.

But how to find β? β is the central angle for arc FL. If we can find β, then we can compute α. 

To find β, perhaps using the right angles mentioned. Let's reconsider the right angles. 

If the right angle is at M between L and F, then β is 90°, as previously discussed. But this leads to a contradiction in the chord length. But maybe we can ignore that contradiction and proceed. Let's try.

Assume that β = 90°, so sin(β/2) = sin(45°) = √2/2. Then, sin(α/2) = 2 * √2/2 = √2, which is impossible. So this suggests that β is not 90°. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at L, leading to some other calculation. But earlier that led to FL = 0, which is impossible. 

Maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that the arc HP is 65°, and the chord HP has length 2r sin(65°/2). Let's call this length x. But we don't know x. However, if we can relate x to other chords. 

But without more information, this seems stuck. 

Wait, the problem gives us several points on the circle, including H, J, P, F, L, etc. Perhaps the diagram has symmetries or specific configurations. For example, since there are multiple points, maybe certain triangles are congruent or similar.

Alternatively, since FL is a chord of length 24, and HJ is a chord of length 48, which is double. This suggests that HJ might be the diameter, since the longest chord in a circle is the diameter. But if HJ were the diameter, its length would be 2r. So 48 = 2r → r = 24. Then, for FL = 24, which would be a chord of length equal to the radius. Wait, but the diameter is 2r, so a chord of length r would correspond to a central angle θ where 2r sin(θ/2) = r → sin(θ/2) = 1/2 → θ/2 = 30° → θ = 60°. So arc FL would be 60°, and arc HJ would be 180°, making the measure of arc HJ 180°, which is not among the options. But the options are A.65, B.120, C.130, D.155. So 180 isn't there. Hence, this suggests that HJ is not the diameter.

Alternatively, if HJ is not the diameter, but has length 48, and FL is 24, then perhaps HJ is twice as long as FL, so the central angle for HJ is double that of FL? But chord length is not directly proportional to the angle. As mentioned before, chord length is proportional to sin(θ/2). So if FL is 24 = 2r sin(β/2) and HJ is 48 = 2r sin(α/2), then sin(α/2) = 2 sin(β/2). 

If we assume that β is 60°, then sin(β/2) = sin(30°) = 0.5, so sin(α/2) = 1 → α/2 = 90° → α = 180°. Again, leading to arc HJ being 180°, which is not an option. 

But if β is smaller, say β = 30°, then sin(β/2) = sin(15°) ≈ 0.2588, so sin(α/2) ≈ 0.5176, so α/2 ≈ 31°, α ≈ 62°. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the arc HP (65°) and the central angles β and α. For example, if arc HP is part of a larger arc that relates to arc HJ. 

Suppose that points H, J, P are arranged such that arc HJ + arc JP = arc HP. But without knowing the position of J relative to P, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if arc HP is 65°, and there's another arc from H to J, and perhaps from J to P, adding up to 65°. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Wait, the problem mentions Arc(H,P,M) = 65°, which is the arc from H to P passing through M. But since M is the center, this arc would pass through M, which is the center, but arcs are parts of the circumference. So this notation might be indicating the arc H to P with the center at M, meaning the arc that goes through the opposite side of the circle. Wait, but M is the center, not a point on the circumference. So this might be a mistake in notation. Perhaps it should be Arc(H,P) with measure 65°, meaning the arc from H to P not containing M. Or the arc containing M? This is unclear.

If we assume that Arc(H,P) is 65°, then the central angle ∠HMP is 65°, as before. Now, if we can relate this to other arcs. 

Let me think about the full circle. Total circumference is 360°. If I can express some arcs in terms of others. 

Suppose arc HP is 65°, and arc HJ is x°, which is what we need to find. If there's a relationship between x and 65°, perhaps through other arcs or angles. 

But without more information, it's challenging. Maybe there's a property involving the right angles. Let me think about the right angles at L and N. 

Assume that the right angle at L (between ML and FL) is actually due to some other property. For example, if FL is a tangent, but F is on the circle, so FL can't be tangent. Alternatively, maybe triangle MFL is a right triangle at L, but this requires ML^2 + LF^2 = MF^2. Since ML = MF = r, this would mean r^2 + LF^2 = r^2 → LF = 0, which is impossible. 

Thus, this suggests that the given predicates may contain errors, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Given that this is a problem meant to be solved, perhaps the right angles are not at L and N, but elsewhere. 

Let me try to reinterpret the right angles. Suppose that the right angle is at M, between L and F, i.e., ∠LMF is 90°. Then, as before, arc FL is 90°, and chord FL = 2r sin(45°) = r√2 = 24 → r = 24 / √2 = 12√2. Then, for chord HJ = 48, which is 2r sin(α/2) = 48 → sin(α/2) = 48 / (2 * 12√2) = 48 / (24√2) = 2 / √2 = √2, which is invalid. Hence, this is impossible.

But perhaps the right angle is at F? If the angle at F between M and L is a right angle, then triangle MFL has a right angle at F. This would mean that ML is perpendicular to FL. Since ML is a radius, and FL is a chord, this would mean that FL is tangent at F, but F is on the circle, so FL would be tangent, making FL a tangent line, but FL is a chord, which is a contradiction. Hence, this is also impossible.

At this point, I'm stuck because the given predicates seem to lead to contradictions. However, since this is a problem designed to have a solution, perhaps I need to overlook the contradictions and focus on the arc measures and chord lengths.

Let's try focusing on the arc HP = 65°, and the chord HJ = 48. Let's assume that the arc HJ is twice the arc HP, but that's just a guess. If arc HJ is 130°, then the central angle would be 130°, and the chord length would be 2r sin(65°). If we can relate this to other information.

But how? Without knowing r, it's hard to say. Let's assume that the arc HJ is 130°, which is option C. Let's see if this makes sense. If arc HJ is 130°, then the chord length is 2r sin(65°). If we can find r from another source.

From arc HP = 65°, the chord length HP = 2r sin(32.5°). But we don't know HP's length. However, if there's a relationship between HP and other chords. 

Alternatively, if there's a way to relate the chords FL and HJ. Since FL = 24 and HJ = 48, which is double. If the central angles are related, maybe the central angle for HJ is double that of FL. Let's say arc FL is β, arc HJ is 2β. Then, from chord lengths:

FL = 2r sin(β/2) = 24  
HJ = 2r sin(β) = 48  

Divide the second equation by the first:  
[2r sin(β)] / [2r sin(β/2)] = 48/24 = 2  
→ sin(β) / sin(β/2) = 2  

Using the identity sin(β) = 2 sin(β/2) cos(β/2):  
→ [2 sin(β/2) cos(β/2)] / sin(β/2) = 2 cos(β/2) = 2  
→ cos(β/2) = 1  
→ β/2 = 0°, which is impossible. Hence, this is not valid.

Alternatively, if arc HJ is triple arc FL? Not sure. 

Let me try another approach. Let's assume that the arc HP is 65°, and there's a relationship between arc HP and arc HJ. For example, if arc HJ is supplementary to arc HP, then arc HJ would be 180° - 65° = 115°, but this is just a guess. Not sure.

Alternatively, if the arc HJ is twice arc HP, then 2*65 = 130°, which is option C. This might be the intended answer, even though the reasoning is not fully supported by the given data. Given that the options include 130°, and the arc HP is 65°, it's plausible that arc HJ is twice that, leading to 130°. This might be based on some symmetry or property not explicitly stated, but given the lack of other clues, this could be the expected answer.

Therefore, choosing option C: 130°.
