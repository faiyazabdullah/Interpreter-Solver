Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a pentagon named B, D, E, C, V. Wait, pentagons have five sides, so those points must form a five-sided figure. Let me note down the given angles and see how they relate.

First, the angles mentioned are at point V. There are four angles listed here: Angle(B,V,D), Angle(D,E,V), Angle(E,C,V), Angle(C,B,V). Then there's another angle mentioned in the sum: Angle(V,B,C). Wait, but the sum includes all five angles of the pentagon? Because the sum of interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees. The problem says SumOf(...) Equals(540). So each of these angles is part of the pentagon's interior angles?

Let me list out the angles:

1. Angle at vertex V between B and D: measure is 5y.
2. Angle at vertex V between D and E: measure is 2x.
Wait, hold on. Wait, the Angle(D,E,V) would mean the angle at point V between points D and E. Wait, no—angles are denoted as Angle(A,B,C) means the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(D,E,V) is the angle at point E between D and V? Wait, no. Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(D,E,V) is the angle at point E between D and V. But wait, in the problem statement, it says "Angle(D,E,V)"—so vertex at E. Similarly, Angle(E,C,V) is angle at C between E and V. Angle(C,B,V) is angle at B between C and V. And the first one, Angle(B,V,D) is angle at V between B and D. Hmm, so some of these angles are at different vertices.

But the sum given includes all five angles of the pentagon. Wait, but the way the angles are given seems like they're all at different vertices. Let me think again.

Wait, the pentagon is B-D-E-C-V connected back to B? Or maybe arranged differently. Let me try to visualize the pentagon. The points are B, D, E, C, V. So the order could be B connected to D, D connected to E, E connected to C, C connected to V, and V connected back to B. That would make a pentagon. But the angles mentioned are at various vertices. For example, Angle(B,V,D) is at point V, between B and D. So that's the angle at V between edges VB and VD. Similarly, Angle(D,E,V) is at E between D and V. Wait, but if the pentagon is B-D-E-C-V-B, then the vertices are B, D, E, C, V. So each consecutive pair is connected. Therefore, the internal angles of the pentagon would be at each vertex: at B, D, E, C, V. Wait, but the angles given are not all at the same vertex. Let me check each angle:

- Angle(B,V,D): vertex at V, between B and D. So that's the angle at V between edges VB and VD. So this is part of the internal angle at V.

Similarly, Angle(D,E,V): vertex at E between D and V. Wait, but if the pentagon has vertices B, D, E, C, V, then the edge at E connects D to E to C. So the internal angle at E would be between D-E and E-C. But the given angle here is Angle(D,E,V)—wait, that's the angle at E between D and V. But V isn't adjacent to E in the pentagon unless the order is different. Maybe I need to clarify the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pentagon is connected as B connected to V, V connected to D, D connected to E, E connected to C, and C connected back to B. So the vertices are B, V, D, E, C. In that case, the internal angles would be at each of these points. Let me consider that possibility.

So, the internal angles of the pentagon would be:

At B: between C and V (since the edges are C-B and B-V).

At V: between B and D (edges B-V and V-D).

At D: between V and E (edges V-D and D-E).

At E: between D and C (edges D-E and E-C).

At C: between E and B (edges E-C and C-B).

Wait, but according to the given angles:

- Angle(B,V,D): at V between B and D → that's the internal angle at V.

- Angle(D,E,V): at E between D and V → but V isn't directly connected to E in this arrangement. Unless the pentagon is ordered B, V, D, E, C. So then, the edges would be B-V, V-D, D-E, E-C, C-B. Then, the internal angles would be:

At B: between C and V (edge C-B and B-V).

At V: between B and D (edges B-V and V-D).

At D: between V and E (edges V-D and D-E).

At E: between D and C (edges D-E and E-C).

At C: between E and B (edges E-C and C-B).

So, in this configuration, the internal angles at each vertex are:

- At B: angle between CB and BV.

- At V: angle between BV and DV.

- At D: angle between DV and DE.

- At E: angle between DE and EC.

- At C: angle between EC and CB.

Now, looking at the given angles:

MeasureOf(Angle(B,V,D)) = 5y → This is the angle at V between B and D, which is the internal angle at V.

MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,V)) = 2x → This is the angle at E between D and V. Wait, but in the current setup, the internal angle at E is between D-E and E-C. However, the given angle here is between D and V. That suggests that V is connected to E? But in the pentagon structure I considered earlier, V is connected to D and B, not to E. So maybe my initial assumption about the pentagon's structure is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the given angles.

Another possibility: the pentagon is B, D, E, C, V arranged such that the edges are BD, DE, EC, CV, VB. Then, the internal angles would be at each of these points. So:

Internal angle at B: between VB and BD.

Internal angle at D: between BD and DE.

Internal angle at E: between DE and EC.

Internal angle at C: between EC and CV.

Internal angle at V: between CV and VB.

But the given angles include:

Angle(B,V,D): vertex at V between B and D. Which would be the angle between VB and VD. But in this arrangement, V is connected to C and B, not D. So that angle wouldn't exist unless there's another edge. Alternatively, maybe the pentagon is B, V, D, E, C connected as B-V, V-D, D-E, E-C, C-B. Then, the internal angles would be:

At B: between C-B and B-V.

At V: between B-V and V-D.

At D: between V-D and D-E.

At E: between D-E and E-C.

At C: between E-C and C-B.

In this case, the internal angle at E is between D-E and E-C. The given angle Angle(D,E,V) would be at E between D and V. But in this structure, E is connected to D and C, not V. So again, V is not connected to E. Therefore, that angle doesn't fit. 

This suggests that perhaps the pentagon is not convex or has intersecting edges, or maybe the labeling is different. Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in a star shape. Wait, but the problem states it's a pentagon, which usually implies a simple polygon without self-intersections. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all the internal angles of the pentagon, but some other angles. Let me look at the sum given: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,V,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,V)), MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,V)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,V)), MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C))) Equals(540). So there are five angles added up to 540, which is the total sum of interior angles of a pentagon. Therefore, these five angles must be the internal angles of the pentagon. 

Therefore, each of these angles corresponds to an internal angle of the pentagon. Let me parse each term:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(B,V,D)): angle at V between B and D → internal angle at V.

2. MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,V)): angle at E between D and V → internal angle at E.

Wait, but if the angle is at E between D and V, then that would imply that the two edges meeting at E are ED and EV. So that would require that V is connected to E. So in the pentagon, there's an edge from E to V. Therefore, the pentagon must include the vertices B, D, E, C, V connected in such a way that E is connected to V. 

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,V)): angle at C between E and V → internal angle at C.

MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,V)): angle at B between C and V → internal angle at B.

And finally, MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)): angle at B between V and C → but wait, that's the same as the previous angle? Wait, no. Wait, the fifth term is Angle(V,B,C), which is angle at B between V and C. So that's the internal angle at B. But we already have MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,V)) which is angle at B between C and V. Are these the same? Yes. So that would mean that the fifth angle is redundant, but since the sum is over five terms, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, but maybe the fifth angle is different. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the five angles in the sum are:

1. Angle(B,V,D) → internal angle at V.

2. Angle(D,E,V) → internal angle at E.

3. Angle(E,C,V) → internal angle at C.

4. Angle(C,B,V) → internal angle at B.

5. Angle(V,B,C) → angle at B between V and C. Wait, but that's the same as angle at B between C and V, which is the same as angle 4. So that would mean that the sum includes duplicate angles, which can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the fifth angle is not the same as the fourth. Let me think again. The fifth term is MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)). Let's break that down: Angle(V,B,C) is the angle at B between V and C. Which is the same as Angle(C,B,V) — because angle at B between C and V. So yes, that's the same as angle 4. Hence, the sum includes two angles at B, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation.

Wait, but maybe the fifth angle is not an internal angle of the pentagon but something else. However, the sum equals 540, which is the sum of the internal angles of a pentagon. Therefore, all five terms must be the internal angles. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Let me re-express the five angles:

1. Angle(B,V,D): at V between B and D → internal angle at V.

2. Angle(D,E,V): at E between D and V → internal angle at E.

3. Angle(E,C,V): at C between E and V → internal angle at C.

4. Angle(C,B,V): at B between C and V → internal angle at B.

5. Angle(V,B,C): at B between V and C → which is the same as angle 4. So this suggests that either there's a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the angle labels.

Alternatively, perhaps the fifth angle is different. Let me check: Angle(V,B,C) is the angle at B between V and C. Wait, but if the pentagon has vertices B, D, E, C, V, then the edges at B are connecting to V and to C? Wait, if the pentagon is B connected to V and C, then the internal angle at B would be between V and C. So that's angle 4. But then why is there another angle at B? Unless the fifth angle is referring to another angle, but that seems conflicting.

This suggests that maybe the pentagon is not labeled sequentially. Perhaps the points are arranged in a non-sequential order. Let me try to imagine the pentagon with vertices B, D, E, C, V. Suppose it's a concave pentagon where some points are inside. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all the internal angles. Wait, the sum is 540, which is the total of the internal angles of a pentagon. So the five angles given must be the internal angles. So even though some seem to refer to the same vertex, perhaps each angle refers to a different internal angle. Let me try again.

Assume that the five internal angles are:

At V: angle(B,V,D) → 5y.

At E: angle(D,E,V) → 2x.

At C: angle(E,C,V) → 108°.

At B: angle(C,B,V) → 120°.

Then, the fifth angle must be at D. Where is the fifth angle? The remaining angle is at D. So where does that come from? The fifth angle is MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C))? No, that's still at B. Wait, maybe the fifth angle is at D. How?

Wait, perhaps there's a missing angle. Let me think. The sum includes five angles: the ones at V, E, C, B, and one more. Since the pentagon has five vertices, each with one internal angle. So far, we have four angles accounted for: V, E, C, B. The fifth must be at D. So where is the angle at D?

Ah! The angle at D would be between the edges coming into D and going out from D. Given that the angle at D is not explicitly mentioned yet. Let me check the given angles again. The given angles are:

- Angle(B,V,D) → at V.

- Angle(D,E,V) → at E.

- Angle(E,C,V) → at C.

- Angle(C,B,V) → at B.

So the fifth angle must be the internal angle at D. How is that represented? It should be the angle at D between incoming and outgoing edges. Assuming the edges around D are V-D and D-E. Therefore, the internal angle at D is between V-D and D-E. So that angle would be Angle(V,D,E), which is the same as Angle(D,E,V)? Wait, no. Angle(V,D,E) is the angle at D between V and E. Whereas Angle(D,E,V) is the angle at E between D and V. So those are different.

Wait, but the given angles don't include the internal angle at D. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Unless the fifth angle is Angle(V,D,E), which is the internal angle at D. But the problem didn't mention that. However, the sum includes MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)), which is the angle at B between V and C. So maybe the fifth angle is the internal angle at D, which is not among the given angles. But the problem says that the sum of all five angles equals 540. Therefore, the five angles included in the sum must be the five internal angles. Thus, there must be a missing angle. This suggests that perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the labeling of the pentagon.

Alternative approach: Let me denote the five internal angles of the pentagon as follows:

Let’s assume the pentagon is labeled in order as V, B, C, E, D. Then the internal angles would be at each of these points. Let's say the order is V connected to B, B to C, C to E, E to D, D to V. Then the internal angles would be:

At V: between D and B.

At B: between V and C.

At C: between B and E.

At E: between C and D.

At D: between E and V.

Now, let's map the given angles:

- Angle(B,V,D): this would be the angle at V between B and D. That's the internal angle at V.

- Angle(D,E,V): this is the angle at E between D and V. Wait, but in this order, E is connected to C and D. So the internal angle at E is between C and D. But the given angle is at E between D and V. So that would require that V is connected to E, which it isn't in this order. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the pentagon is labeled B, D, E, C, V. Then the internal angles are at each of these points. The edges would be B-D, D-E, E-C, C-V, V-B. So:

Internal angles:

At B: between V and D.

At D: between B and E.

At E: between D and C.

At C: between E and V.

At V: between C and B.

Now, the given angles:

- Angle(B,V,D): at V between B and D → this is the internal angle at V.

- Angle(D,E,V): at E between D and V → but in this structure, E is connected to D and C. To have an angle at E between D and V, V must be connected to E, which it isn't. So again, inconsistency.

This is getting too complicated. Let me focus on the fact that the sum of the given angles is 540. The five angles in the sum are:

1. Angle(B,V,D) → at V, measure 5y.

2. Angle(D,E,V) → at E, measure 2x.

3. Angle(E,C,V) → at C, measure 108°.

4. Angle(C,B,V) → at B, measure 120°.

5. Angle(V,B,C) → at B, measure ?

Wait, but Angle(V,B,C) is the angle at B between V and C. Which is the same as Angle(C,B,V), which is already given as 120°. So this suggests that the fifth angle is also 120°, making the total sum 5y + 2x + 108 + 120 + 120 = 540. But that would mean 5y + 2x + 348 = 540 → 5y + 2x = 192. However, this assumes that the fifth angle is the same as the fourth, which is redundant. But the problem states that the sum includes MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)), which may be a different angle. Wait, no—Angle(V,B,C) is the same as Angle(C,B,V), since angle at B between V and C. So this indicates that the sum has two angles at B, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in interpreting the given angles.

Perhaps the fifth angle is not at B but somewhere else. Let me re-express the given angles:

Looking back, the fifth term is MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)). This angle is at B between V and C. But if the pentagon has edges connecting V to B and C to B, then that's the internal angle at B. So if that's the case, then the fourth and fifth angles are both at B, which can't be. Hence, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fifth angle is not an internal angle but an external angle? No, the sum is supposed to be 540, which is the sum of internal angles. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the fifth angle is the internal angle at D. How can that be represented? If there's an angle at D, then it would be Angle(V,D,E), which is the angle at D between V and E. But the given angles do not include that. However, the problem mentions that the sum includes MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)), which is at B. So perhaps the fifth angle is at D, and its measure is not given directly but needs to be found. But the problem gives us five angles, so I must have missed something.

Wait, let's count the number of angles given:

- Angle(B,V,D): 1

- Angle(D,E,V): 2

- Angle(E,C,V): 3

- Angle(C,B,V): 4

- Angle(V,B,C): 5

So five angles. Now, each of these corresponds to an internal angle of the pentagon. Let me assign them to the vertices:

1. Angle(B,V,D) → internal angle at V.

2. Angle(D,E,V) → internal angle at E.

3. Angle(E,C,V) → internal angle at C.

4. Angle(C,B,V) → internal angle at B.

5. Angle(V,B,C) → internal angle at B? Or at D? Wait, Angle(V,B,C) is at B, so it's the same as angle 4. So this suggests that there are two angles at B, which is impossible. Hence, this must mean that my interpretation is wrong.

Maybe the fifth angle is not at B but at D. How? Let me think. If the fifth angle is Angle(V,D,B), which would be the internal angle at D. But how is that represented? Let me check the given angles again. The fifth angle is Angle(V,B,C). Wait, that's at B. So this is perplexing.

Alternatively, perhaps the pentagon is not a simple pentagon, and some of these angles are reflex angles. But regardless, each vertex has one internal angle. 

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the given equations and see what happens. Let's suppose that the five angles in the sum are:

1. At V: 5y

2. At E: 2x

3. At C: 108°

4. At B: 120°

5. At D: ? Let's call this angle z.

Then, the sum is 5y + 2x + 108 + 120 + z = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 540 - 328 = 212.

But we need to find z. How?

From the given angles, perhaps there's a relationship between these angles. For example, if the pentagon is cyclic or has certain properties. But we don't know that.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of the angles around point V? Wait, but that would involve exterior angles. Not sure.

Wait, but we have angles at different vertices. If we can find relations between them via triangle properties or other figures.

Wait, let's think about the angles at each vertex. Suppose we consider triangles formed within the pentagon. For example, if we draw diagonals from V to C, or something like that.

Alternatively, consider that the sum of all internal angles is 540. We have three of the angles: 5y, 2x, 108, 120, and the fifth angle z. So 5y + 2x + z = 212.

But we need more equations. Perhaps the angles at V and B are related? Or other relationships.

Wait, if we look at the diagram, perhaps the pentagon can be divided into triangles or other shapes. Let's think: if we connect V to C, creating a diagonal. Then, the pentagon is split into three triangles: VBD, VDE, and VEC? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the angles at V and B are parts of triangles.

Alternatively, consider the angles at V. The angle at V is 5y. If there are other angles at V, but in a pentagon, each vertex has only one internal angle. So that's just 5y.

Wait, but if the angle at V is 5y, and if there are other angles involving V, like in triangles, but that might not help.

Wait, let's think about the given angles. We have:

- At V: 5y

- At E: 2x

- At C: 108°

- At B: 120°

- At D: z

Total: 5y + 2x + z + 108 + 120 = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 212.

But we need to find x. So we need another equation relating y and x. 

Is there any other information? The problem gives MeasureOf(Angle(B,V,D)) = 5y, which is the internal angle at V. Also, Angle(D,E,V) is 2x, which is the internal angle at E. 

Wait, but if we consider the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, if we draw a diagonal from V to C, then the angle at V (5y) and other angles might relate to other triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the sum of angles around point V. Wait, but in a pentagon, each vertex has only one internal angle. The sum of angles around V would be 360°, but that includes the internal angle plus any adjacent angles. But since it's a pentagon, the angle at V is part of the internal angle, and other angles at V would depend on the shape.

Wait, no. The internal angle at V is just 5y. The rest of the angles around V would be outside the pentagon.

Alternatively, consider that the pentagon might contain other structures. For example, if there's a triangle involving V, B, and C. The angle at B is 120°, and the angle at V is 5y. But without knowing other angles, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe there's a triangle involving points B, V, and C. The angle at B is 120°, and at V is 5y. If we knew another angle in that triangle, we could use the triangle angle sum. But we don't have enough info.

Wait, but perhaps the angle at V (5y) and the angle at B (120°) are part of a larger structure. Like, if there's a triangle involving V, B, and another point.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles at point V. If there are other lines from V, like to C or to D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but we have the angle at V as 5y. If we consider that the pentagon is connected such that from V, there are edges to B and to D, and possibly others. Let me try to think of the pentagon as having vertices V, B, C, E, D. So the edges are V-B, B-C, C-E, E-D, D-V. Then, the internal angles are:

At V: between D and B → 5y.

At B: between V and C → 120°.

At C: between B and E → 108°.

At E: between C and D → 2x.

At D: between E and V → z.

So the sum is 5y + 120 + 108 + 2x + z = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 212.

But we need another relation. Is there a way to find z?

If we consider the triangle formed by points B, C, and D? Wait, but in this pentagon structure, B is connected to C and V, C is connected to B and E, D is connected to E and V. So triangle BCD would not necessarily exist.

Alternatively, consider the triangle formed by V, B, and C. In this triangle, we have angle at B as 120°, angle at V as 5y, and angle at C as... Well, if we can find the third angle. But we don't know anything about the angle at C in this triangle. However, the internal angle at C in the pentagon is 108°, which might be related to this triangle.

Wait, if we draw a diagonal from C to V, then the angle at C in triangle BCV would be part of the internal angle of the pentagon. Let me think: in triangle BCV, the angle at C would be part of the internal angle at C of the pentagon, which is 108°. But without knowing how the diagonal splits the angle at C, it's unclear.

Alternatively, if the pentagon is convex, then all internal angles are less than 180°. Given that one angle is 108°, which is acute, and 120°, which is obtuse, and 5y and 2x could vary.

But we need another equation. Let me think: if we consider the triangle at point E. The internal angle at E is 2x. If there are other angles at E, but in the pentagon, it's just the internal angle. So maybe not helpful.

Wait, but what if the pentagon is composed of triangles? For example, if we divide the pentagon into three triangles by drawing diagonals from V to C and V to D. Then, the total sum of angles would be 3*180 = 540, which matches the pentagon's total. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, think about the sum of the angles around point V. In a pentagon, the internal angle at V is 5y. If there are other angles at V from diagonals, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between the angles at V and B. For instance, if there's a straight line or something. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging.

Wait, but the problem gives us MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,V)) = 120°, which is the internal angle at B. And MeasureOf(Angle(V,B,C)) is the same as that, so perhaps it's redundant. But since the sum includes both, that suggests that there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the fifth angle is not an internal angle but an external one. But that would change the total sum. 

Wait, let me try assuming that there's a mistake in the problem and that the fifth angle is at D, and that the given angles are:

At V: 5y

At E: 2x

At C: 108°

At B: 120°

At D: z

With sum 5y + 2x + 108 + 120 + z = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 212.

Now, if I can find another equation involving y and x. Let me think about the triangles formed by the diagonals.

For example, if we draw a diagonal from B to E. Then, the pentagon is divided into three parts: triangle BEV, quadrilateral BEDC, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider triangle VBC. In this triangle, we have angle at B is 120°, angle at V is 5y, and angle at C is something. But what is the angle at C in this triangle? It depends on how the diagonal divides the pentagon.

Wait, if the diagonal is from B to C, then it's already an edge. Wait, in the pentagon structure I assumed earlier (V-B-C-E-D-V), the edge B-C exists. So triangle VBC has vertices V, B, C. The angles at these points are:

At V: 5y.

At B: 120°.

At C: ?

The sum of angles in triangle VBC is 180°, so 5y + 120 + angle_at_C_in_triangle = 180 → angle_at_C_in_triangle = 180 - 5y - 120 = 60 - 5y.

But what is this angle_at_C_in_triangle? It's part of the internal angle at C in the pentagon, which is 108°. If the diagonal BC divides the internal angle at C into two parts: one being angle_at_C_in_triangle and another part. Wait, but if the pentagon has an internal angle at C of 108°, and the diagonal BC is drawn, then the angle at C in the triangle VBC is part of that 108°. But unless there's another diagonal, we can't be sure.

Alternatively, if the diagonal is from C to V, then the angle at C in triangle CVB would be part of the internal angle at C. But without knowing how the diagonal splits the angle, it's hard to say.

However, if we assume that the diagonal from V to C creates a triangle VBC, and that the angle at C in this triangle is the same as the internal angle at C of the pentagon, which is 108°. But that would mean 60 - 5y = 108 → -5y = 48 → y = -9.6, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at C in the triangle VBC is supplementary to the internal angle at C. But that would depend on whether the diagonal creates an exterior angle. 

This approach seems stuck. Let me think differently. Since the sum of the angles is 540, and we have three angles given: 5y, 2x, 108, 120, and z. Let's suppose that z is the angle at D. Can we find z in terms of other variables?

If we consider the triangle at D. For example, if there's a triangle involving D, E, and V. The internal angle at D is z, and the angle at E is 2x. But without more information, it's hard to link them.

Wait, but if we consider the angle at E, which is 2x. If there's a triangle involving E, D, and V, then the sum of angles in that triangle would be 180°. Let's say the triangle is VED. The angles would be at V, E, and D. But we don't know the angles at V and D in this triangle. However, the angle at E is 2x. So 2x + angle_at_V_in_triangle + angle_at_D_in_triangle = 180. But without knowing those other angles, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, if we consider that the angle at E (2x) is part of a triangle with other angles. 

I'm stuck. Let me try plugging in the answer choices to see which one fits.

The options are A. 36, B. 54, C. 60, D. 108.

Assuming that x is one of these, let's try to find possible values.

Let me recall that the sum of the angles is 5y + 2x + z = 212. If I can express z in terms of x or y.

Wait, if we consider that the pentagon is made up of triangles, and the sum of all internal angles is 540. Let me think about the angles at each vertex:

We have:

At V: 5y

At E: 2x

At C: 108

At B: 120

At D: z

Total: 5y + 2x + 108 + 120 + z = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 212.

Now, if I can find another equation. Let's think about the triangle formed by points B, C, and V. As before, in triangle BVC, angles are at B: 120°, at V: 5y, and at C: let's call it w. So 120 + 5y + w = 180 → w = 60 - 5y.

But what is w? If the diagonal from B to C is drawn, then w is part of the internal angle at C, which is 108°. If the diagonal BC divides the angle at C into two parts: one being w and another part. Let's say the other part is t. So w + t = 108. But without knowing t, we can't proceed.

Unless there's another diagonal. For example, if there's a diagonal from C to D, forming another triangle.

Alternatively, if we consider that the angle at C in triangle BVC is w = 60 - 5y, and this is part of the internal angle at C (108°). So if the diagonal BC splits the internal angle at C into w and t, then t = 108 - w = 108 - (60 - 5y) = 48 + 5y. 

But how does this help? If there's another triangle involving point C and D, perhaps.

Alternatively, consider the angle at D, z. If there's a triangle involving D, E, and C, then the internal angle at D is z, and at E is 2x. Let's say in triangle DEC, the angles are at D: z, at E: 2x, and at C: some angle. But again, without more info, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if we assume that the pentagon is regular, but since one angle is 108°, which is common in a regular pentagon (each internal angle is 108°), but here we have other angles like 120°, so it's not regular. But maybe there's a relation.

Wait, if the angle at C is 108°, which is the same as a regular pentagon's internal angle. Maybe the pentagon is partly regular. But without more info, it's speculative.

Alternatively, let's assume that the angle at D, z, is related to other angles. For example, if the pentagon is symmetric in some way.

But this is too vague. Let me try to think of possible values for x. Let's take option B: x=54. Then 2x = 108. Substituting into the equation 5y + 2x + z = 212 → 5y + z = 104. But without knowing y or z, can't solve. 

Option A: x=36 → 2x=72 → 5y + z = 140.

Option C: x=60 → 2x=120 → 5y + z = 92.

Option D: x=108 → 2x=216 → 5y + z = -104 → impossible, since angles are positive.

So D is invalid. So possible answers are A, B, or C.

Let me think of another approach. Suppose that the sum of angles at V and B and C and E and D is 540. We know three of the angles: at C is 108, at B is 120, at E is 2x, at V is 5y, and at D is z. So 5y + 2x + z = 212.

Now, if I can find another relationship. Let's think about the fact that the angle at V is 5y and the angle at B is 120. If there is a triangle involving V, B, and another point, like C, then as before, in triangle VBC, the angles are 5y at V, 120 at B, and w at C, where w = 60 - 5y. This w is part of the internal angle at C, which is 108. So w + something = 108. Let's say the other part is t, so w + t = 108 → t = 108 - w = 108 - (60 - 5y) = 48 + 5y.

Now, if this t is part of another angle, like at point C. If there's a diagonal from C to D, then the angle at C between B and D would be t = 48 + 5y. But this angle t is part of the internal angle at C, which is 108. So if t is 48 + 5y, and there's another angle at C, maybe related to the angle at E.

Wait, the angle at E is 2x. If there's a diagonal from E to C, then the angle at E is 2x, and if there's a triangle involving E, C, and D, then the angle at E is 2x, and the angle at C is t = 48 + 5y, and the angle at D would be part of that triangle. Let's say in triangle EDC, the angles are at E: 2x, at C: t = 48 + 5y, and at D: let's say s. Then, 2x + (48 + 5y) + s = 180 → s = 180 - 2x - 48 - 5y = 132 - 2x - 5y.

But s is the angle at D in this triangle, which might be related to the internal angle at D, z. If the diagonal DC is drawn, then the internal angle at D is z, which might be equal to s. So z = 132 - 2x - 5y.

Now, substitute this into our earlier equation: 5y + 2x + z = 212 → 5y + 2x + (132 - 2x - 5y) = 212 → 5y + 2x + 132 - 2x - 5y = 132 = 212 → 132 = 212, which is false. So this approach leads to a contradiction. Hence, my assumption must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D in the triangle EDC is not the same as the internal angle z. Maybe it's part of it. For example, if there's another diagonal, like from D to C, then the angle at D in the triangle EDC is part of the internal angle z. But without knowing how many diagonals are present, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle s is part of the internal angle z. For example, if the internal angle at D is z, and s is part of it, then z = s + something. But without knowing, it's unclear.

This seems too convoluted. Let me try a different angle. Let's assume that the pentagon is such that the sum of angles at V and B and C and E and D is 540, and try to find x.

We have:

5y + 2x + 108 + 120 + z = 540 → 5y + 2x + z = 212.

If I can find another equation relating y and x. Let's think about the triangle at V. If there is a triangle involving V, B, and D, with angle at V being 5y, and angles at B and D being part of other angles.

But I don't have information about those.

Wait, but if we consider the angle at V (5y) and the angle at B (120°), and if there is a straight line or something. For example, if the angle at V and the angle at B are part of a straight line, but that would require them to add up to 180°, which would give 5y + 120 = 180 → 5y = 60 → y = 12. Then, substituting back into 5y + 2x + z = 212 → 60 + 2x + z = 212 → 2x + z = 152. But without knowing z, this is still two variables.

But if we assume that z is related to other angles. For example, if the angle at D is related to the angle at E (2x). If there's a straight line or something. For example, if the angle at D and angle at E add up to 180°, then z + 2x = 180 → z = 180 - 2x. Substituting into 2x + z = 152 → 2x + 180 - 2x = 152 → 180 = 152, which is false. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, if z = 2x, then 2x + z = 4x = 152 → x = 38, which is not among the choices. So this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if z = 108°, then 2x + 108 = 152 → 2x = 44 → x = 22, not in choices.

Alternatively, if z is 120°, then 2x + 120 = 152 → x = 16, not in choices.

This approach is not working.

Wait, but the given angles include MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,V)) = 108°, which is the internal angle at C. And MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,V)) = 120°, which is the internal angle at B. Let's assume that the angle at C is 108°, and at B is 120°, and at E is 2x, at V is 5y, and at D is z.
