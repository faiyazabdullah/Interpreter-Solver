MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral RQTS with points R, Q, T, S. The sides are lines connecting them in order: R to Q, Q to T, T to S, and S back to R. Then there are several angles mentioned: Angle at Q (RQT), Angle at T (QTS), Angle at S (TSR), and Angle at R (SRQ). 

Wait, actually, looking at the predicates, the angles are listed as Angle(R,Q,T) which would be the angle at point Q between points R and T. Similarly, Angle(Q,T,S) is the angle at T between Q and S. Then Angle(T,S,R) is the angle at S between T and R, and Angle(S,R,Q) is the angle at R between S and Q. So these four angles make up the quadrilateral. 

The measures of these angles are given in terms of x. Let me note down each angle's measure:

- Measure of ∠RQT (at Q): x
- Measure of ∠QTS (at T): 2x + 5
- Measure of ∠TSR (at S): x
- Measure of ∠SRQ (at R): 2x + 7

And the sum of all four angles equals 360 degrees because it's a quadrilateral. Wait, but wait—quadrilaterals' interior angles sum to 360 degrees regardless of type. So the equation given here is SumOf(...) = 360. 

So let me write that out:

x + (2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) = 360

Let me compute that. Combining like terms:

x + 2x + 5 + x + 2x + 7 = 360  
Adding the x terms: x + 2x + x + 2x = 6x  
Constants: 5 + 7 = 12  
So total equation: 6x + 12 = 360

Subtract 12 from both sides: 6x = 348  
Divide by 6: x = 348 / 6 = 58. 

Wait, so x is 58? But the question asks for m∠R. Which angle is that?

Looking back at the angles: The angles are at Q, T, S, R. The measure of ∠SRQ is the angle at R, which is given as 2x + 7. Therefore, substituting x=58:

Measure of ∠R is 2*58 + 7 = 116 + 7 = 123. Hmm, but none of the options is 123. Wait, the options are A. 58, B. 60, C. 122, D. 124. Closest is C or D. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I misread which angle corresponds to m∠R. Let me check again. 

The angles are defined as follows:

Angle(R,Q,T) is the angle at Q, between R and T. So that's ∠RQT, which is at Q. 

Then Angle(Q,T,S) is at T, between Q and S: ∠QTS.

Angle(T,S,R) is at S, between T and R: ∠TSR.

Angle(S,R,Q) is at R, between S and Q: ∠SRQ. So yes, the angle at R is ∠SRQ, which is 2x +7. 

But according to my calculation, that gives 123. However, the options don't have 123. Let me double-check my math. 

Original equation: 6x +12 = 360. Subtract 12: 6x = 348. Divide by 6: 348 divided by 6. Let's do that division again. 6*50=300, 348-300=48. 48/6=8. So total x=58. Correct. 

Then 2x+7 is 2*58=116 +7=123. But since 123 isn't among the options, perhaps there's an error in interpreting the angles? Or maybe I messed up the angle labels?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the quadrilateral is a trapezoid or something where some angles are supplementary? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any specific type of quadrilateral, just a general one. 

Alternatively, could there be an error in how I set up the equations? Let me re-express the angles. 

Sum of angles in quadrilateral is indeed 360. The angles given are:

At Q: x

At T: 2x +5

At S: x

At R: 2x +7

Total sum: x + (2x+5) + x + (2x+7) = 6x +12 = 360 → x=58. That seems correct. 

So angle at R is 2x +7 = 123. Since 123 isn't an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check if the angle at R is different. Wait, maybe I got the angle labels wrong. Let me look again.

The angle definitions:

Angle(R,Q,T) is the angle at Q. Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠RQT has vertex at Q. So that's correct. 

Similarly, Angle(Q,T,S) is at T. So ∠QTS. Then Angle(T,S,R) is at S: ∠TSR. And Angle(S,R,Q) is at R: ∠SRQ. So that's correct. 

Thus, the angle at R is ∠SRQ = 2x +7. So with x=58, that's 123. But since that's not an option, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check the problem statement again. 

Wait, the problem says:

"Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(Q,T,S)), MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,R)), MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,Q))), 360)"

Yes, that's the sum of all four angles. So the setup is correct. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is cyclic? If it were cyclic, opposite angles would sum to 180. But in this case, angles at Q and S are both x. So if they are opposite, then x + x = 2x = 180 → x=90. But that contradicts our previous result. However, the problem does not state that the quadrilateral is cyclic, so assuming that is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to exterior angles? No, the problem states the sum of the measures of the four angles given, which are the interior angles. 

Wait, unless there's a misunderstanding in the way the angles are labeled. For example, maybe the angle at R is not ∠SRQ but another angle. Let me visualize the quadrilateral. Points R-Q-T-S-R. So the vertices are R, Q, T, S connected in order. So the four angles are at each vertex:

- At R: between S and Q (since the sides are S-R and R-Q). So that's ∠SRQ, which is the angle at R between S and Q. Yes, that's correct. 

So that angle is 2x +7. 

So why isn't 123 an option? The closest options are C.122 and D.124. Maybe there was a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I made an arithmetic error. Let me check the calculation once more. 

Equation: 6x +12 = 360 → 6x = 348 → x = 348 / 6. Let me calculate 348 ÷ 6:

6 × 50 = 300. 348 − 300 = 48. 48 ÷ 6 = 8. So x = 58. Correct. 

Then 2x +7 = 2×58 +7 = 116 +7 = 123. 

Since this isn't an option, perhaps there's an error in the problem setup? Or maybe I need to consider that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram or something else. Wait, but without being told that, we can't assume. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are not all interior angles? For instance, maybe some are exterior? But the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(...)) which typically refers to interior angles unless specified otherwise. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a different kind of quadrilateral where the sum isn't 360? No, that's impossible. All quadrilaterals have interior angles summing to 360. 

Wait, unless the quadrilateral is self-intersecting, making it a complex quadrilateral. In that case, the sum could be different. But the problem doesn't indicate that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's translation or in the given answer choices. But assuming the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps I should check if there's another interpretation. 

Wait, let me think again about the angle measures. Suppose that the angle at R is not ∠SRQ but another angle. Let me list all angles again:

The four angles are:

1. ∠RQT (at Q): x
2. ∠QTS (at T): 2x +5
3. ∠TSR (at S): x
4. ∠SRQ (at R): 2x +7

So adding those gives 6x +12 = 360 → x=58. So angle at R is 2x+7 = 123. 

But since that's not an option, maybe the problem intended the angle at R to be x instead of 2x+7? Let me see. If that were the case, then the sum would be x + (2x+5) + x + x = 5x +5 = 360 → 5x=355 → x=71. Then angle at R would be x=71. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at R is x instead of 2x+7. Wait, but the problem defines the angles as per the given predicates. The last angle is MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,Q)), which is ∠SRQ, at R. So that's 2x+7. 

Is there any other possible way? Let me check if the problem might involve supplementary angles or something else. For example, maybe two angles are supplementary? 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses radians instead of degrees? But the answer choices are numerical, and 123 degrees is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in translating the angle expressions. Let me check the original problem's predicates again:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,T)), x) → ∠RQT = x

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q,T,S)), Add(Mul(2, x), 5)) → ∠QTS = 2x +5

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,R)), x) → ∠TSR = x

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,Q)), Add(Mul(2, x), 7)) → ∠SRQ = 2x +7

Sum is 360. 

So the equations are correct. 

Hmm. Given that, the answer should be 123, but it's not an option. This suggests either a mistake in the problem or perhaps a miscalculation. Wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 

6x +12 = 360 → 6x = 348 → x = 348 / 6. Let me divide 348 by 6:

6 × 50 = 300, remainder 48.

48 / 6 = 8. So x = 58. Correct. 

Then 2x +7 = 2*58 +7 = 116 +7 = 123. 

Wait, but the options are A. 58, B. 60, C. 122, D. 124. So the closest is 122 (option C) or 124 (D). Perhaps there was a rounding error or a typo in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the sum wasn't supposed to be 360, but another number? Let me check the problem statement again. It says:

Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(R,Q,T)), MeasureOf(Angle(Q,T,S)), MeasureOf(Angle(T,S,R)), MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,Q))), 360)

Yes, that's stated. 

Wait, unless the problem is referring to the sum of the exterior angles? But the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees. However, in that case, the individual exterior angles would be different. But the problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(...)), which likely refers to interior angles. 

Alternatively, if the problem had said that the sum of the exterior angles is 360, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the sum of the angles is 180? No, that's for triangles. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's creation. For example, if the angle at R was supposed to be x instead of 2x+7, then the sum would be x + (2x+5) +x +x = 5x +5 = 360 → x = 71. Still not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the angle at R was 2x +5 instead of 2x+7, then sum is x + (2x+5) +x + (2x+5) = 6x +10 = 360 → 6x=350 → x≈58.33... Then angle at R would be 2x+5 ≈ 121.66, which rounds to 122, which is option C. 

This suggests that maybe there was a typo in the problem, where the angle at R was meant to be 2x +5 instead of 2x +7. But since we can't change the problem, perhaps the intended answer is C.122, assuming that there was a typo in the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angle expressions. Let me check again:

The fourth angle is MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,Q)). According to the definition, the middle letter is the vertex. So S-R-Q means the angle at R between S and Q. Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the angle at R is 2x +7. 

Given that, and the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is D.124, if there's a miscalculation. Wait, let me try plugging x=58 into 2x+7: 2*58=116 +7=123. But if somehow the equation was 6x +12 = 360, but with a different constant term. Wait, suppose there was a mistake in the problem's constants. For example, if the angle at T was 2x +5 and the angle at R was 2x +5 instead of 2x+7, then the sum would be x + (2x+5) +x + (2x+5)= 6x +10=360 → 6x=350 → x=350/6 ≈58.33. Then angle at R would be 2*(350/6)+5 ≈ 116.66 +5=121.66, which is approximately 122. Hence, option C. 

Alternatively, if the angle at R was 2x + 6 instead of 7, then angle would be 2*58 +6=122. So option C. 

Given that, and considering possible typos, the closest answer is C.122. So even though mathematically the answer should be 123, which isn't an option, the closest available choice is C.122. Hence, I'll go with option C.
