MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P, and several points on it: J, K, L, M, N. The question is about finding the measure of arc NJK. 

First, let me recall the given information. From the predicates, I know that points J, K, L, M, N are all on circle P. Also, there are lines from P to each of these points, so those are radii since they're connecting the center to the circumference. That means PL, PM, PJ, PK, PN are all radii of the circle. 

Now, the angles mentioned are ∠MPL measuring 65 degrees, and NP is perpendicular to PL. Since NP is a radius, and PL is another radius, their intersection at point P forms a right angle. Wait, but NP is perpendicular to PL. So, angle NPL is 90 degrees. 

So, looking at point P, there are two radii: PL and PN forming a right angle. Then there's another radius PM making a 65-degree angle with PL. Let me visualize this. Imagine circle P, with PL going horizontally to the right. Then PN is vertical upwards because it's perpendicular to PL. Point M is somewhere such that angle MPL is 65 degrees. So starting from PL, rotating 65 degrees towards PN? Or maybe the other way?

Wait, angle MPL is at point P, with segments PM and PL. So vertex at P, one side PM, and the other PL. So, if PL is horizontal, then PM is making a 65-degree angle with PL. Since NP is perpendicular to PL, so NP is vertical. Therefore, the position of N is straight up from P. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc NJK. Points N, J, K are all on the circle. But wait, the arc NJK would be from N to J to K? Or is it the arc passing through J and K? Wait, arcs are named by their endpoints, so arc NJK would be the arc from N to K passing through J. But need to confirm how the points are arranged.

But first, perhaps I should find the measure of the arc corresponding to angle at P. Since angle at the center, the measure of the arc is equal to the measure of the central angle. For example, angle MPL is 65 degrees, so the arc ML would be 65 degrees. Similarly, since NP is perpendicular to PL, the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees, so arc NL would be 90 degrees. 

Wait, but angle NPL is 90 degrees, so the arc from N to L would be 90 degrees. Now, the arc NJK... Hmm, need to figure out where points J and K are located. 

Looking back, points J, K, L, M, N are all on the circle. But their positions aren't specified except through the angles. Let me think again. 

We know that PM makes a 65-degree angle with PL. So, starting from PL (which is part of the radius to L), moving 65 degrees towards some direction. Since NP is perpendicular to PL, which is 90 degrees, so maybe the positions are arranged such that from PL, moving counterclockwise, we have PM at 65 degrees, then NP is straight up, so maybe the rest of the points are placed accordingly. 

Alternatively, maybe the order of points around the circle is important. Let me consider the circle centered at P. Let me imagine placing point L somewhere, say at the rightmost point of the circle. Then, since NP is perpendicular to PL, point N would be directly above P. So, if PL is horizontal to the right, then PN is vertical upward. 

Then, angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So, PM is a radius that forms a 65-degree angle with PL. Depending on the direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Assuming standard position, maybe counterclockwise. So, starting from PL (right) and turning 65 degrees counterclockwise, which would place point M in the upper half-circle. 

Now, the arc from N to J to K. Wait, but where are points J and K? They are also on the circle, but their positions aren't directly given. However, since all points are on the circle, and we have several radii, perhaps their placement relates to the angles given. 

Wait, but the problem mentions arc NJK. Arc NJK implies that the arc starts at N, goes through J, and ends at K. To find its measure, we need to determine the total degrees between N and K passing through J. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of arcs NK and KJ? Not sure yet. 

Let me think about the positions. We know that angle NPL is 90 degrees (since NP ⊥ PL). So, the arc from N to L is 90 degrees. Also, angle MPL is 65 degrees, so arc from M to L is 65 degrees. 

Assuming that points are ordered around the circle in some way. Let me try to sketch mentally:

- Start at point L, then moving counterclockwise, we encounter point M (since angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees). Then, continuing counterclockwise, we might pass through other points like J and K. But without knowing the exact arrangement, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe points J and K are positioned symmetrically or in relation to other angles. Wait, but we don't have info about angles involving J and K except that they lie on the circle. 

Wait, but the problem says "m∠MP L = 65" and "NP ⊥ PL". So, angle at P between M and L is 65°, and NP is perpendicular to PL. So, the arc from N to L is 90°, as mentioned earlier. 

Now, if we can find the positions of J and K relative to these points. But since J and K are arbitrary points on the circle, unless there's more constraints. Wait, but maybe the arc NJK refers to something else. Maybe the arc from N to K passing through J. 

Alternatively, could there be another angle involved? For instance, if we can find the measure of arc NK, then add arc JK. But without knowing where J and K are, this seems difficult. 

Wait, maybe there's a missing piece here. Are there any other given angles or relationships involving J and K? Looking back at the predicates, the only things are that J, K, L, M, N are points on the circle. There's no explicit angles given involving J or K except that they are on the circle. 

Wait, but maybe the arc NJK is formed by three points on the circle, so the measure would be the sum of arcs NJ and JK. But again, without knowing their positions, this isn't helpful. 

Hold on, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The problem states "Find m∠NJK". Wait, no, the question is about the measure of arc NJK, not an angle. The original question says: "Find m widehat NJK", which is arc NJK. 

Wait, but maybe there's a property that connects the given angles to the arc measures. Let me think. 

Since NP is perpendicular to PL, arc NL is 90 degrees. Angle MPL is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. If we can find the arc from N to K via J, maybe by considering other arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc NJK corresponds to the sum of arcs NJ and JK. But without knowing where J and K are, how can we compute that? 

Wait, but maybe points J and K are positioned such that they form specific relations. Wait, the problem includes points J, K, L, M, N on the circle, but doesn't specify their order. However, since all are connected to P via radii, each of them is at a different direction from P. 

Wait, but if we consider the angles between the radii. For example, the angle between PN and PL is 90 degrees. The angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. What about the other points? 

Suppose we imagine the circle with center P. Let me assign coordinates for easier calculation. Let’s assume P is at the origin (0,0). Let’s take PL along the positive x-axis, so point L is at (r, 0), where r is the radius. Since NP is perpendicular to PL, NP is vertical. So, point N is at (0, r). 

Now, angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So, PM makes a 65-degree angle with PL (the x-axis). So, point M is somewhere in the plane. The coordinates of M would be (r cos θ, r sin θ), where θ is 65 degrees. So, θ = 65°, so coordinates of M are (r cos 65°, r sin 65°).

Now, points J and K are also on the circle. Their positions aren't directly given, but maybe they are related to other angles or arcs. However, the problem doesn't mention any angles involving J or K. Unless there's an implied relationship through the circle's symmetry or other properties. 

Wait, but the arc NJK—maybe the arc from N to K passing through J. To find its measure, we need to find the measure of the arc from N to K that passes through J. Which would depend on the positions of J and K. But since J and K are just arbitrary points on the circle, unless there's more constraints, how can we determine this? 

Wait, perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me re-read the problem. 

"In ⊙P, m∠MPL = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJK."

Wait, the question is actually asking for the measure of arc NJK, not angle NJK. Wait, the original problem says "m widehat N J K"—arc NJK. So, the measure of arc NJK. 

But how do we determine this? Since the points are on the circle, but we don't know their order. However, maybe the arc NJK is determined by the angles given. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation. Let me check the original problem again. 

Original problem: "In ⊙P, m∠MPL = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJK." Wait, no—the user wrote the question as "Find m widehat N J K." So, arc NJK. 

Hmm. Let me think again. Given that, maybe the arc NJK is composed of arcs that can be found using the given angles. 

For example, arc from N to L is 90 degrees (as NP is perpendicular to PL). Arc from L to M is 65 degrees (since angle MPL is 65 degrees). So, if we can find the arc from N to K via J, maybe it's combining some of these arcs. 

Wait, but where is point J? It's on the circle. Suppose that the points are arranged such that J is diametrically opposite to some point, or maybe aligned with others. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but maybe the arc NJK is the sum of arcs NJ and JK. But since we don't know where J and K are, this seems stuck. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the question is about angle NJK instead of arc NJK? Because otherwise, with the given info, it's unclear. 

Wait, let me check the initial problem again. The user wrote: 

"Question: In ⊙P, m∠MPL = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m widehat N J K."

Ah, the symbol "widehat" usually denotes an arc. So, the question is asking for the measure of arc NJK. 

Given that, maybe there's a way to relate the given angles to the arc. Let's consider the entire circle is 360 degrees. 

We know arc NL is 90 degrees (from NP ⊥ PL). Arc ML is 65 degrees (from angle MPL being 65 degrees). If we can find other arcs. 

But how does this relate to arc NJK? Perhaps if points J and K are positioned such that they complete certain arcs. 

Wait, but without more information about J and K, it's impossible to determine their positions. Unless there's an assumption that J and K are placed symmetrically or in some relation to other points. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, all points J, K, L, M, N are on the circle. But there's no explicit angles involving J and K. However, the problem gives us five points on the circle, but the question involves three of them: N, J, K. 

This suggests that maybe there's a standard configuration or that J and K are positioned in a particular way. 

Wait, perhaps the arc NJK is formed by adding arcs that are known. For example, suppose that points J and K are placed such that arc NJ plus arc JK equals the desired arc. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the major arc or minor arc depending on the positions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the angles at P and the arcs. For instance, since angle NPL is 90°, arc NL is 90°, and angle MPL is 65°, arc ML is 65°. So, if we can find the arc from N to K via J, maybe by subtracting or adding these arcs. 

Wait, but how? Let me think. If we consider the full circle as 360°, and we have arc NL = 90°, arc ML = 65°, but how does that connect to arc NJK?

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is formed by moving from N to J to K, which could involve the arc from N to L (90°), then from L to M (65°), and then from M to K? But that depends on the position of K. 

Wait, but without knowing where K is, this approach is not working. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Since all the points J, K, L, M, N are on the circle, and NP is perpendicular to PL, and PM makes a 65-degree angle with PL. Maybe there's a way to determine the positions of J and K based on other angles. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any angles involving J or K. So unless there's an implicit assumption that J and K are positioned such that they form certain symmetries. 

Wait, but maybe the arc NJK is the same as arc NL + arc LK? But again, not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the arc NJK is the remaining portion of the circle after accounting for the known arcs. For example, if we have arc NL = 90°, arc ML = 65°, and assuming that points J and K are placed such that the arc from N to K passes through J, which could be part of the remaining arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a right angle involved. Since NP is perpendicular to PL, and if there are other right angles or known angles that could help. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the supplement of some known arc. 

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me think differently. 

Maybe the arc NJK is formed by the central angles corresponding to angles at P. For example, if there's an angle subtended by arc NJK at the center P, which would be the measure of the arc. 

But to find that angle, we need to know the angle at P between N and K. But how?

Wait, if I can find the measure of angle NPK, then that would be equal to the measure of arc NK. But the question is about arc NJK, which may involve point J. 

Unless the arc NJK is the same as arc NK, but passing through J, implying that J lies on arc NK. 

But how can I determine that? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a missing piece in the problem setup. Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's Isradiusof(Line(N, P), Circle(P)), which confirms that NP is a radius. Same for PM, PJ, PK. So, all points J, K, L, M, N are on the circle, and their connecting lines to P are radii. 

Therefore, the positions of J, K, L, M, N are determined by their angles from P. 

But how? Since we have angles between PM and PL (65°), and between PN and PL (90°). So, the angle between PN and PL is 90°, and between PM and PL is 65°. 

So, if I imagine the circle with center P, and PL pointing to the right (say, along the x-axis), then PN is pointing upward (along y-axis). The point M is at an angle of 65° from PL, so in the direction of 65° from the x-axis. 

Now, where are J and K? Well, they are other points on the circle. But since the problem doesn't provide any angles involving J or K, perhaps they are placed such that they are symmetric or form specific angles. 

Wait, but the problem asks for arc NJK. Maybe it's referring to the arc from N to K that passes through J, which would mean that J is between N and K on the arc. 

If that's the case, then the measure of arc NJK would be the sum of arcs NJ and JK. 

But without knowing the positions of J and K, how can we calculate this? 

Wait, maybe there's an assumption that J and K are placed such that they are symmetric with respect to some axis, or that they form specific angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and it's supposed to ask for the measure of arc NMK or something similar. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the same as arc NK, and the measure can be derived from the given angles. 

Wait, if I consider the arc from N to K, then the central angle would be the difference between the angles of N and K from point P. 

But how do I find the angle of K? 

Wait, unless there's an implied relationship. For example, if points J and K are placed such that they are reflections or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the sum of arc NL (90°) and arc LK, but again, not knowing arc LK. 

Wait, but we know arc ML is 65°, so if K is at point L, then arc MK would be 65°, but that's not helpful. 

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to reconsider the problem from scratch. 

Let me start over. 

Given circle P with points J, K, L, M, N on it. All lines from P to these points are radii. 

We have angle MPL = 65°, which is a central angle, so arc ML measures 65°. 

Also, NP ⊥ PL, so angle NPL is 90°, hence arc NL measures 90°. 

Now, the question is about arc NJK. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in the order N, J, K, L, M around the circle, but that's just a guess. 

Wait, but without knowing the order, it's ambiguous. However, perhaps the arc NJK is the arc from N to K passing through J, and we can find the measure by calculating the sum of arcs NJ and JK. 

To do this, we need to find the measure of arc NJ and arc JK. 

But how? 

Wait, if we can find the measure of arc NK, then if J lies on that arc, the measure of arc NJK would be equal to arc NK. But again, without knowing where J is, this is unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the major arc, and we need to calculate it based on known arcs. 

Total circle is 360°. We know arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°. What about the rest? 

If we consider the arc from N to L is 90°, arc from L to M is 65°, then the arc from M to N would be 360° - 90° - 65° = 195°? No, that assumes the arcs are adjacent. 

Wait, if arc NL is 90°, and arc ML is 65°, then the positions of L and M are separated by 65°, and N is 90° away from L. So, if we imagine the circle with N at top, L at right, M somewhere in the upper half. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but if we consider the entire circle, and we know two arcs: NL (90°) and ML (65°). The sum of these arcs is 90 + 65 = 155°. The remaining arc would be 360 - 155 = 205°. 

But this still doesn't help with arc NJK. 

Perhaps there's an alternative approach. Since the problem gives us points J and K, but no direct info about them, maybe the arc NJK is related to the angles we know. 

Wait, if the arc NJK is formed by the points N, J, K, and since all are on the circle, maybe there's a relationship between the angles at P. 

Wait, if I consider the central angles. For example, the central angle for arc NJ would be the angle between PN and PJ, and similarly for arc JK. 

But without knowing where J and K are, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe the problem has a typo and meant to ask for arc NK, which would be 90° + 65° = 155°, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, since angle NPL is 90°, and angle MPL is 65°, then the angle between PN and PM would be 90° - 65° = 25°, which could correspond to arc NM. 

Wait, if the angle between PN and PM is 25°, then arc NM would be 25°, making the measure of arc NJK... if J and K are positioned such that it covers arc NM plus something else. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, let me think again. If angle between PN and PL is 90°, and between PL and PM is 65°, then the angle between PN and PM is 90° - 65° = 25°, assuming they are on the same side. So, the arc from N to M would be 25°, which would make arc NM = 25°. 

If that's the case, then arc NJK might involve this arc NM. But again, without knowing where J and K are, it's unclear. 

Wait, but the problem might be asking for arc NJK, which could be the arc from N to K passing through J, and if J is a point such that arc NJ is part of the known arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is formed by arc NL (90°), arc LK (unknown), and arc KJ (unknown). Still not helpful. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I missed something in the problem. Let me review the predicates again. 

The given predicates include Pointliesoncircle(J, Circle(P)), etc. So, J, K, L, M, N are points on the circle. Lines from P to each are radii. Angles at P: ∠MPL = 65°, and ∠NPL = 90°. 

Wait, maybe the arc NJK is the arc that corresponds to the angle at P between N and K, which would be the central angle. But how to find that angle?

If we can find the measure of angle NPK, then that would give the measure of arc NK. But how? 

We know angle NPL = 90°, and angle MPL = 65°. So, if we can find the angle between PN and PK, but we don't know anything about PK. 

Wait, unless there's an assumption that points J and K are placed such that they form specific relationships. For example, if J and K are placed such that arc NJ and arc JK are related to the known arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the supplement of the known arcs. For example, if arc NL is 90° and arc ML is 65°, then the arc from N to M is 25°, as before. If arc NJK is the major arc from N to K, it would be 360° minus the minor arc NK. 

But again, without knowing where K is, it's impossible. 

Wait, but maybe the answer is 25°, which is the difference between 90° and 65°, as I thought earlier. If the arc NJK is the arc from N to K, which is 25°, then the answer would be A. But why? 

Alternatively, if the arc NJK is the arc that corresponds to the angle between N and K, which is 25°, then the answer would be A. But this is pure speculation. 

Given that the options are A. 25, B. 75, C. 90, D. 155. 

If I consider that the angle between PN and PM is 25°, then arc NM is 25°. If the arc NJK is the same as arc NM, then the answer would be A. 

But why would arc NJK be arc NM? Unless J and K are the same as M and N, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc NJK is the arc from N to K passing through J, which is the same as arc NM plus arc MJ. But without knowing where J is, this is not helpful. 

Wait, maybe there's a missing piece. Let me think about the total circle. If arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°, then the arc from N to L to M is 90+65=155°. The remaining arc from M to N is 360-155=205°. 

But if arc NJK is part of this remaining arc, it's still unclear. 

Another idea: since NP is perpendicular to PL, and PM makes a 65° angle with PL, then the angle between NP and PM is 90-65=25°, which is the central angle for arc NM, so arc NM is 25°. If the arc NJK is arc NM, then the answer is 25°, choice A. 

But why would arc NJK be arc NM? Because maybe J and K are the same as N and M? Or maybe the arc NJK is intended to represent arc NM, but the problem statement uses J and K. This is very speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is the arc from N to K, and since J is a point on the circle, it's possible that the arc NJK is the arc from N to K passing through J, which would be the same as arc NK. But how to find arc NK? 

If we assume that arc NK is the complement of arc LM, but I don't see the connection. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the total circle is 360°, and we know arc NL (90°), arc ML (65°), and arc MN (25°), then the remaining arc would be from K to N, but again, no info on K. 

Wait, but if arc NM is 25°, and if J is a point on the arc from N to M, then arc NJK could be arc NM, which is 25°, making the answer A. 

This is the best guess I have, even though it's based on assumptions. Given that, the answer would be A.
