Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points Q, A, D, E, F, X. There's a circle Q, so Q is the center since there are radii mentioned. Points A, D, E are on the circle because Line(Q,A), Line(Q,D), Line(Q,E) are radii. So QA, QD, QE are all radii of the circle Q. That means QA = QD = QE in length.

Then there are lines XD and XE, which are tangent to the circle Q. Also, the lines XD and XE are both tangent, so point X is outside the circle, and XD and XE are tangents from X to the circle. Since tangents from a common external point are equal in length, so XD should equal XE. But wait, the problem says that the length of XE is 24, and XD equals XE, so XD is also 24. Wait, but DE is given as 7. Hmm.

Also, there's a RightAngle at Angle(A,D,X) and Angle(A,E,X). So angles at D and E between AD and XD, and AE and XE are right angles. Wait, maybe those are right angles? Let me think. The Angle(A,D,X) being a right angle would mean that line AD is perpendicular to XD. Similarly, AE is perpendicular to XE. 

So, considering that, points A, D, E are on the circle, and X is outside with two tangent lines XD and XE. Then, since AD and AE are radii, and XD and XE are tangents, so AD is perpendicular to XD, and AE is perpendicular to XE. Therefore, triangles ADX and AEX are right triangles with right angles at D and E respectively.

Wait, but since XD and XE are both tangents from X to the circle, then XD = XE, which is given as 24. Also, DE is given as 7. So DE is the distance between points D and E on the circle, which are endpoints of a chord. 

Now, we need to find TX, but wait, the question says "Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7." Wait, maybe there was a typo? Or perhaps it's asking for the length of XA? Or maybe TX refers to something else? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the question is "Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7." Maybe there's a missing part here. Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be "Find XA"? Because TX isn't mentioned in the predicates. Alternatively, maybe it's a misprint and they meant FX? Or maybe it's referring to another segment?

Wait, looking again at the original problem. The user wrote: "Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7." Wait, maybe "T X" is a typo for "XA"? Because TX isn't mentioned elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe "TX" is a segment from T to X, but there's no mention of point T. Wait, checking the initial list of points: Points are Q, A, D, E, F, X. No T mentioned. Hmm. This seems confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps "T X" refers to another segment?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the length of XA? Because sometimes in problems, variables like T could be typos. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the length of AX, which is a radius? But if so, then why give DE and EX?

Wait, let's check the given data again. The problem gives us that EX is 24, DE is 7, and asks to find TX. But since TX isn't defined in the given predicates, unless T is another point. Wait, the points listed are Q, A, D, E, F, X. So T isn't among them. Maybe there's a missing point? Or maybe T is a typo for another letter? For example, maybe it's supposed to be "Find XA"?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the length of DX? But that's given as 24. Wait, the problem states that EX=24 and DE=7. The answer choices are numbers: 7, 24, 25, 32. So likely, the question is asking for the length of XA or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about finding the length of XA, given that EX=24, DE=7. Let me try to work with that assumption.

Let me visualize the setup. We have a circle with center Q, points A, D, E on the circumference. Lines XD and XE are tangents from point X to the circle. So, X is outside the circle, and XD and XE are tangents touching the circle at D and E respectively. Also, QA, QD, QE are radii, so QA=QD=QE=r (radius).

Given that angles at D and E are right angles (AD ⊥ XD and AE ⊥ XE). So, triangles ADX and AEX are right-angled at D and E respectively.

Additionally, DE is a chord of the circle with length 7. And EX=24.

Since XD and XE are both tangents from X to the circle, they are equal in length. So XD=XE=24. Therefore, triangle XDE has sides XD=XE=24 and DE=7. Wait, but DE is a chord of the circle. However, X is outside the circle, so DE is a chord, and X is connected to D and E via tangents.

But how does this relate to the rest? Let's consider coordinates. Maybe placing the circle at origin, but perhaps more straightforward to use coordinate geometry or power of a point.

Power of a point X with respect to circle Q is equal to the square of the tangent length, so XQ² - r² = XD² = XE² = 24² = 576. So XQ² = r² + 576.

But also, DE is a chord of the circle. The length of chord DE is 7. The length of a chord is given by 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle subtended by the chord. Alternatively, using the formula for chord length: DE = 2√[r² - d²], where d is the distance from the center to the chord. Wait, but in this case, DE is a chord, so its length is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is ∠DQE. Alternatively, using coordinates, suppose we place points D and E such that DE is horizontal, centered at the circle's center Q. But maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since we know DE=7, and points D and E are on the circle, then the distance between D and E is 7. Also, X lies outside the circle, and XD and XE are tangents. Now, since XD and XE are both tangents, then X lies on the external homothety axis of the circle, but perhaps more importantly, the line XQ passes through the midpoint of DE? Not necessarily, unless DE is bisected by Q. Wait, Q is the center, so DE is a chord, so the line from Q to the midpoint of DE is perpendicular to DE. But how does that relate to X?

Alternatively, considering triangles XDE. In triangle XDE, we know XD=XE=24, DE=7. So it's an isoceles triangle with sides 24,24,7. So we can compute the height of this triangle from X to DE. Let me calculate that. The height h satisfies (7/2)^2 + h^2 = 24^2. So h^2 = 24² - (7/2)² = 576 - 49/4 = (2304/4 - 49/4) = 2255/4. So h = sqrt(2255)/2 ≈ ... Well, maybe not directly helpful yet.

But how does this relate to the rest? Also, since angles at D and E are right angles. So, AD is perpendicular to XD, and AE is perpendicular to XE. So, AD ⊥ XD and AE ⊥ XE. Which implies that AD and AE are the radii at points D and E, and XD and XE are tangents. Thus, AD and AE are perpendicular to the tangents at D and E. Therefore, lines AD and AE are the normals to the tangents at D and E.

Therefore, points A, D, E are such that AD and AE are radii, and XD and XE are tangents. So, point A is somewhere on the circle such that AD and AE are radii. Wait, but points D and E are fixed as points on the circle. How is point A related to D and E?

Wait, maybe A is another point on the circle. So, the circle has points A, D, E. Then, lines AD and AE are radii? Wait, no. The radii are QA, QD, QE. So, QA is the radius from Q to A, QD from Q to D, QE from Q to E. So, AD is a chord connecting points A and D on the circle. Similarly for AE.

But the problem says that angles at D and E are right angles. Specifically, angle ADX is a right angle, so triangle ADX is right-angled at D. Similarly, triangle AEX is right-angled at E. So, in triangle ADX, right-angled at D, with legs AD and XD, hypotenuse AX. Similarly for triangle AEX, right-angled at E, with legs AE and XE, hypotenuse AX. Therefore, AX is the hypotenuse of both triangles. Hence, AX² = AD² + XD² = AE² + XE². But since AD and AE are radii, AD = AE = r. And XD = XE = 24. So AX² = r² + 24². 

But also, since points D and E are on the circle, DE is a chord of length 7. So, the distance between D and E is 7. Also, the distance between D and E can be found using the law of cosines in triangle DQE. Since Q is the center, QD = QE = r, and angle DQE is the central angle over chord DE. So, DE² = 2r²(1 - cosθ), where θ is the central angle. So, 7² = 2r²(1 - cosθ). So, 49 = 2r²(1 - cosθ). 

But we need another relation involving r. Perhaps using the fact that AX² = r² + 24². Also, what is AX? Is there a way to express AX in terms of other quantities? 

Alternatively, since we have two right triangles ADX and AEX, both sharing hypotenuse AX. So, AX is the same in both. Also, AD = AE = r, so the two right triangles are congruent? Not sure. But perhaps we can find AX in terms of r, and find relations between r and the chord DE.

Another idea: since DE is a chord of the circle, and points D and E are on the circle, then the line DE can be related to the position of point X. Also, since XD and XE are tangents, and X lies outside the circle. The line XQ connects the external point X to the center Q of the circle. The power of point X with respect to the circle is XQ² - r² = XD² = XE² = 24² = 576. So, XQ² = r² + 576.

But how does this relate to the other elements? Also, perhaps triangle XDE has some relation to the circle. Alternatively, maybe triangle XDE relates to triangle ADE or something else.

Wait, considering triangle XDE: it's an isosceles triangle with sides 24,24,7. Earlier calculation showed that the height from X to DE is sqrt(24² - (7/2)^2) = sqrt(576 - 12.25) = sqrt(563.75) ≈ 23.74... But not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, since AD and AE are radii, and AD is perpendicular to XD, AE perpendicular to XE. So, AD and AE are perpendicular to the tangents. Therefore, lines AD and AE are the normals to the tangents at D and E. So, the lines AD and AE are the radii at points D and E, hence they are perpendicular to the tangents. Therefore, the direction of AD is along the radius at D, and similarly for AE.

Now, consider quadrilateral ADEX. It has right angles at D and E. So, AD ⊥ XD and AE ⊥ XE. So, if we connect points A, D, E, X, forming a quadrilateral with two right angles at D and E. What shape is this?

Alternatively, since AD and AE are radii, and X is outside, maybe there's a relationship between AX and the distances from X to the circle.

Wait, earlier we had AX² = r² + 24². Also, since points D and E are on the circle, and DE = 7. So, using the chord length formula, DE = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle between D and E. So, 7 = 2r sin(θ/2), so sin(θ/2) = 7/(2r).

Also, from the power of point X: XQ² = r² + 576. But we need to relate XQ to something else. Maybe using triangle XQA? But not sure.

Alternatively, since AD is perpendicular to XD, and AE perpendicular to XE, then lines AD and AE are the normals at D and E. So, vectors AD and AE are perpendicular to vectors XD and XE, respectively. So, if we can model coordinates, maybe assign coordinates to simplify.

Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point D at (-d, 0) and point E at (d, 0), making DE = 2d. Wait, but DE is given as 7, so 2d = 7 → d = 3.5. Then the midpoint of DE is at the origin, but the center Q of the circle may not be at the origin. Wait, but if DE is a chord of the circle, then the center Q lies along the perpendicular bisector of DE. Since DE is horizontal from (-3.5, 0) to (3.5, 0), its perpendicular bisector is the y-axis. So, the center Q is somewhere along the y-axis. Let's denote Q as (0, k) for some k.

Points D(-3.5, 0) and E(3.5, 0) are on the circle. So, the distance from Q to D is the radius r. So,

r² = (distance from Q to D)² = (-3.5 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = (3.5)^2 + k².

Similarly for E, same thing.

Now, the point X is outside the circle, and XD and XE are tangents. Since X lies on the external point, and the tangents from X to the circle touch at D and E. The locus of points X from which tangents are drawn to a circle is the set of points lying on the external tangent lines. Also, the line joining X to Q passes through the intersection of the tangents. Wait, but since XD and XE are tangents, then X lies on the polar of the circle, and the line XQ is the line joining the external point to the center.

Moreover, the power of point X with respect to the circle is |XQ|² - r² = XD² = 24² = 576. So, |XQ|² = r² + 576.

But we need to find coordinates for X. Also, since XD and XE are tangents, and D and E are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, X must lie along the y-axis? Wait, because the tangents from X to points D and E are symmetric. If DE is horizontal and symmetric about the y-axis, then X must lie along the y-axis. Otherwise, the tangents to D and E wouldn't be symmetric. So, assume X is on the y-axis. Let me confirm this.

Yes, because if X were off the y-axis, the tangents to D and E would not be symmetric. Given that XD and XE are both tangents and the configuration is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, X must lie on the y-axis. So, coordinates of X are (0, m) for some m. But since X is outside the circle, depending on whether it's above or below. Assuming it's above the circle, m > k or m < k. Wait, if the center is at (0,k), then depending on the sign of k. Let's proceed.

Coordinates:

- D(-3.5, 0)

- E(3.5, 0)

- Q(0, k)

- X(0, m)

Now, the tangent from X to D is XD. The equation of the tangent at D(-3.5, 0) to the circle centered at Q(0,k) with radius r. The condition for the tangent line at D is that it is perpendicular to QD. The slope of QD is (0 - k)/(-3.5 - 0) = (-k)/(-3.5) = 2k/7. Therefore, the slope of tangent XD, which is perpendicular to QD, is -7/(2k). 

Equation of tangent at D: passing through D(-3.5, 0) with slope -7/(2k):

y - 0 = [-7/(2k)](x + 3.5)

This line must pass through X(0, m). Substituting x=0, y=m:

m = [-7/(2k)]*(0 + 3.5) = [-7/(2k)]*(7/2) = -49/(4k)

So, m = -49/(4k). Similarly, since X is on the y-axis, and the tangent at E would give the same condition due to symmetry, confirming that X is on the y-axis.

Now, the length XD is 24. Let's compute XD. Point X(0, m), D(-3.5, 0). Distance squared:

XD² = (0 - (-3.5))² + (m - 0)^2 = (3.5)^2 + m² = 12.25 + m² = 24² = 576.

Thus, m² = 576 - 12.25 = 563.75 = 2255/4. So m = ±sqrt(2255)/2. But since X is outside the circle, and assuming the circle's center Q is below X (so that the tangents go upward), then m would be positive. So, m = sqrt(2255)/2. But we might not need the exact value.

But we also know that the power of point X with respect to the circle is XQ² - r² = XD² = 576.

Compute XQ²: X is at (0,m), Q is at (0,k). So XQ² = (0 - 0)^2 + (m - k)^2 = (m - k)^2.

Therefore, (m - k)^2 - r² = 576.

But r² is the radius squared, which is (from point D): r² = (3.5)^2 + k² = 12.25 + k².

Substitute into the power equation:

(m - k)^2 - (12.25 + k²) = 576.

Expand (m - k)^2 = m² - 2mk + k².

So substituting:

m² - 2mk + k² -12.25 -k² = 576 → m² - 2mk - 12.25 = 576 → m² - 2mk = 576 + 12.25 = 588.25.

From earlier, we found that m² = 563.75. So substitute m²:

563.75 - 2mk = 588.25 → -2mk = 588.25 - 563.75 = 24.5 → mk = -24.5 / 2 = -12.25.

So, mk = -12.25.

But from earlier, we had m = -49/(4k). So substitute m into mk = -12.25:

[-49/(4k)] * k = -49/4 = -12.25. Which is true because 49 divided by 4 is 12.25, and negative. So this checks out. So our equations are consistent.

Now, what do we need to find? The question says "Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7." As before, the confusion is about what TX refers to. Given that all points are named except T, but perhaps it's a typo and should be XA? Or maybe TA? But without knowing where T is, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe it's the length of AX?

Assuming the intended question is to find the length of AX, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ADX. From earlier, AX² = AD² + XD² = r² + 24². But we need to find r.

We have from the chord DE: DE = 7, which is 2*sqrt(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. Wait, no. The length of chord DE is 2*sqrt(r² - p²), where p is the distance from the center to the chord. Here, since DE is horizontal, and the center Q is at (0, k), the distance from Q to DE is the vertical distance from Q to the line DE (which is the x-axis, since DE is from (-3.5, 0) to (3.5, 0)). The line DE is the x-axis. So the distance from Q(0,k) to DE (the x-axis) is |k|. Therefore, the length of DE is 2*sqrt(r² - k²) = 7. So:

2*sqrt(r² - k²) = 7 → sqrt(r² - k²) = 7/2 → squaring both sides: r² - k² = 49/4 → r² = k² + 49/4.

Earlier, we also had from the power of point X:

(m - k)^2 - r² = 576. But we also have r² = k² + 49/4. Let me substitute that into the equation:

(m - k)^2 - (k² + 49/4) = 576 → expanding (m - k)^2 = m² - 2mk + k² → substitute:

m² - 2mk + k² - k² - 49/4 = 576 → m² - 2mk - 49/4 = 576.

But earlier we found that m² - 2mk = 588.25 (since 576 + 12.25 = 588.25). Let's verify:

Yes, because m² - 2mk = 588.25, and 588.25 - 49/4 = 588.25 - 12.25 = 576. So that holds. So no new info here.

But we need to find AX. Recall that AX² = r² + 24². So we need to find r².

From earlier, r² = k² + 49/4.

But we also have from the power of point X: (m - k)^2 = r² + 576. Wait, no: the power of point X is XQ² - r² = 576 → XQ² = r² + 576 → but XQ² is (m - k)^2. So:

(m - k)^2 = r² + 576 → expand left side: m² - 2mk + k² = r² + 576.

But from earlier, r² = k² + 49/4. Substitute:

m² - 2mk + k² = k² + 49/4 + 576 → m² - 2mk = 49/4 + 576.

Which is exactly what we had earlier. So again, no new info.

But we need to find AX² = r² + 24². To find r², we need another equation. Let's see.

We also have from the expression for r² = k² + 49/4. But how to find k?

Recall from earlier that mk = -12.25. And m = -49/(4k). So substituting into mk = -12.25:

(-49/(4k)) * k = -49/4 = -12.25, which is true. So no new info. Hence, we have infinitely many solutions for k, but we need to find r².

Alternatively, perhaps we can find r² from the expression for AX²? Wait, but we don't know AX yet. Unless there's another relation.

Wait, but we have two expressions for r²:

r² = k² + 49/4.

And from the power of point X, (m - k)^2 = r² + 576. But m is expressed in terms of k. Earlier, m = -49/(4k). So:

(m - k)^2 = (-49/(4k) - k)^2 = [(-49 - 4k²)/4k]^2 = [-(4k² + 49)/4k]^2 = (4k² + 49)^2 / (16k²).

Set this equal to r² + 576:

(4k² + 49)^2 / (16k²) = r² + 576.

But r² = k² + 49/4. Substitute:

(4k² + 49)^2 / (16k²) = k² + 49/4 + 576.

Multiply both sides by 16k²:

(4k² + 49)^2 = 16k²(k² + 49/4 + 576).

Expand the left side: (4k² + 49)^2 = 16k^4 + 392k² + 2401.

Right side: 16k²(k² + 49/4 + 576) = 16k²*k² + 16k²*(49/4) + 16k²*576 = 16k^4 + 4*49k² + 9216k² = 16k^4 + (196 + 9216)k² = 16k^4 + 9412k².

So equating left and right:

16k^4 + 392k² + 2401 = 16k^4 + 9412k².

Subtract 16k^4 from both sides:

392k² + 2401 = 9412k² → 2401 = 9412k² - 392k² = (9412 - 392)k² = 9020k².

Thus, k² = 2401 / 9020.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(2401, 9020). Let's see, 2401 is 49² = 7^4. Check if 9020 divisible by 7: 9020 ÷ 7 = 1288.57… nope. So GCD is 1. So k² = 2401/9020.

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation? Let me recheck the expansion.

Left side: (4k² + 49)^2 = 16k^4 + 2*4k²*49 + 49² = 16k^4 + 392k² + 2401. Correct.

Right side: 16k²(k² + 49/4 + 576). Compute inside the brackets:

k² + 49/4 + 576 = k² + (49/4 + 576). Convert 576 to fourths: 576 = 2304/4. So total is k² + (49 + 2304)/4 = k² + 2353/4. So multiplying by 16k²:

16k² * k² + 16k² * (2353/4) = 16k^4 + 4*2353k² = 16k^4 + 9412k². Correct.

Thus, the equation becomes 16k^4 + 392k² + 2401 = 16k^4 + 9412k² → 392k² + 2401 = 9412k² → 2401 = 9020k² → k² = 2401/9020.

So k = sqrt(2401/9020) = 49/sqrt(9020). Simplify sqrt(9020)? Let me factor 9020.

Factor 9020: divide by 4: 9020 = 4 × 2255. 2255 factors into 5×451. 451 is prime? Let's see, 451 ÷ 11 = 41, remainder 0? 11*41=451? 11*40=440, plus 11=451. Yes! So 9020 = 4×5×11×41. So sqrt(9020) = sqrt(4×5×11×41) = 2×sqrt(2255). So k = 49/(2√2255).

Not very helpful. But perhaps we can proceed numerically?

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's recall that AX² = r² + 24². And we need to find AX. But we also have that DE = 7, and we've used that in the chord length formula. 

Alternatively, since AX is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ADX, and AD is a radius r. So AX² = r² + 24². But also, from the chord DE, we have that the central angle θ over DE satisfies DE = 2r sin(θ/2) = 7. So sin(θ/2) = 7/(2r). Also, the triangle DQE has sides QD = QE = r, DE = 7. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle DQE: DE² = 2r²(1 - cosθ). So:

7² = 2r²(1 - cosθ) → 49 = 2r²(1 - cosθ).

But also, from the Power of a Point, we have XQ² = r² + 576. And XQ is the distance from X to Q. But how does that relate to other parts?

Alternatively, since X lies on the y-axis, and we've placed coordinates accordingly, maybe we can find AX. Coordinates of A: since A is a point on the circle. But where is A located? We haven't determined its position yet. 

Wait, the problem mentions Point(A), and Line(Q,A) is a radius. So A is a point on the circle. But where? Are there any constraints on A? The problem mentions angles at D and E being right angles. So, AD is perpendicular to XD, and AE is perpendicular to XE. So, AD ⊥ XD and AE ⊥ XE. 

In our coordinate system, XD is the tangent at D, which has slope -7/(2k) as previously calculated. AD is the radius from Q(0,k) to D(-3.5, 0). The vector QD is from Q to D: (-3.5 - 0, 0 - k) = (-3.5, -k). So the slope of QD is (-k)/(-3.5) = 2k/7. As before. The line AD is from A to D, but since A is also on the circle. Wait, but how is A positioned?

Actually, A is another point on the circle. So, the line AD connects A to D. But we also know that AD is perpendicular to XD. So, the line AD has slope perpendicular to XD's slope. The slope of XD is -7/(2k), so the slope of AD should be the negative reciprocal, which is 2k/7. 

Wait, AD is a line from A to D, which is perpendicular to XD. So, the line AD has slope equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of XD. The slope of XD is -7/(2k), so the slope of AD is 2k/7. 

But AD is also a chord of the circle, from A to D. Let me parametrize point A. Since A is on the circle, its coordinates satisfy the circle equation. The circle has center Q(0, k) and radius r, so equation is x² + (y - k)^2 = r².

Point D is (-3.5, 0), so plugging into the circle equation: (-3.5)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r² → 12.25 + k² = r², which we already have.

Now, the line AD has slope 2k/7. Let me write the equation of line AD. It goes through D(-3.5, 0) and has slope 2k/7. So the equation is:

(y - 0) = (2k/7)(x + 3.5)

This line intersects the circle at points A and D. We need to find point A ≠ D on this line.

To find A, solve the system:

1. x² + (y - k)^2 = r²
2. y = (2k/7)(x + 3.5)

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:

x² + [(2k/7)(x + 3.5) - k]^2 = r².

Expand the second term:

[(2k/7)(x + 3.5) - k] = (2k/7)x + (2k/7)*3.5 - k = (2k/7)x + (k) - k = (2k/7)x.

Wait, because (2k/7)*3.5 = (2k/7)*(7/2) = k. So subtract k, giving zero? Wait:

Wait, [(2k/7)(x + 3.5) - k] = (2k/7)x + (2k/7)*3.5 - k = (2k/7)x + k - k = (2k/7)x. Oh! So the entire second term simplifies to (2k/7)x. So the equation becomes:

x² + [(2k/7)x]^2 = r² → x² + (4k²/49)x² = r² → x²(1 + 4k²/49) = r² → x² = r² / (1 + 4k²/49) = r² * 49 / (49 + 4k²).

But we also know that one solution is x = -3.5 (point D). So, let's find the other solution.

The quadratic equation in x is x²(1 + 4k²/49) - r² = 0. The product of the roots is -r² / (1 + 4k²/49) ? Wait, no. Actually, the equation is x² = r² / (1 + 4k²/49), so the solutions are x = ± sqrt[r² / (1 + 4k²/49)]. But one root is x = -3.5. Let me check.

Wait, this suggests that the line AD intersects the circle at x = ± sqrt(...), but one of them is x=-3.5. So, let me plug x = -3.5 into the equation:

x² = (-3.5)^2 = 12.25 = r² / (1 + 4k²/49). So:

12.25 = r² / (1 + 4k²/49) → r² = 12.25 * (1 + 4k²/49).

But we already know r² = 12.25 + k² from earlier. So:

12.25 + k² = 12.25 * (1 + 4k²/49) → Expand RHS: 12.25 + 12.25*(4k²)/49.

So:

12.25 + k² = 12.25 + (12.25 * 4k²)/49 → Subtract 12.25 from both sides:

k² = (12.25 * 4k²)/49 → Multiply both sides by 49:

49k² = 12.25 * 4k² → Divide both sides by k² (assuming k ≠ 0):

49 = 12.25 * 4 → 12.25 * 4 = 49. Exactly! Because 12.25 * 4 = 49. So this identity holds. Hence, no new information. So this confirms consistency but doesn't help us find k.

Thus, we're stuck in loops here. Need another approach.

Let me return to the goal: find AX. We have AX² = r² + 24². So if we can find r², we can compute AX.

From earlier, we have:

From the chord DE: r² = k² + 49/4.

From the power of point X: (m - k)^2 = r² + 576.

But we also have m = -49/(4k).

So let's substitute r² into the power equation:

(m - k)^2 = (k² + 49/4) + 576.

Expand (m - k)^2 = m² - 2mk + k².

So:

m² - 2mk + k² = k² + 49/4 + 576 → m² - 2mk = 49/4 + 576 = 588.25.

But we already know that m² = 563.75 (from XD² = 24² = 576 = 3.5² + m² → m² = 576 - 12.25 = 563.75).

So, substituting m² = 563.75 into m² - 2mk = 588.25:

563.75 - 2mk = 588.25 → -2mk = 24.5 → mk = -12.25.

Which is consistent with earlier results. So still no progress.

But we need to find r² = k² + 49/4. How?

Maybe we need to find k from somewhere. Let me think. We have from the earlier equation where k² = 2401/9020. Let me compute that:

k² = 2401 / 9020 ≈ 2401 / 9020 ≈ 0.266. So r² = k² + 49/4 ≈ 0.266 + 12.25 ≈ 12.516.

Then AX² = r² + 24² ≈ 12.516 + 576 ≈ 588.516. Taking square root gives AX ≈ 24.26, which is close to 24.26. But none of the answer choices are close to this. The options are 7, 24, 25, 32. So this suggests that my assumption about what TX refers to is incorrect.

Perhaps the question is asking for the length of XA, but with this calculation, it's approximately 24.26, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the error is in assuming TX is XA. Let me think differently.

Wait, the problem says "Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7." Maybe "T X" is a typo and should be "AX". Or maybe it's "DX", but that's 24. Or "DE" is 7, which is given. Or maybe it's the length of QA, which is r. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's setup. Let me revisit the initial assumptions.

We assumed that X is on the y-axis, but maybe that's not correct. Or maybe there's a different configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves triangle XDE and applying Pythagoras or other relations.

Wait, earlier I considered triangle XDE with sides 24, 24, 7. Its height from X to DE is h = sqrt(24² - (7/2)^2) = sqrt(576 - 12.25) = sqrt(563.75). But this height might be related to the radius or something else.

Alternatively, since AD and AE are radii, and AD ⊥ XD, AE ⊥ XE, then AX is the hypotenuse of the right triangles ADX and AEX, so AX is the same in both. Also, points A, D, E are on the circle. Maybe triangle ADE is related to X?

Alternatively, consider the triangle formed by points A, D, E. Since DE = 7, and AD and AE are radii. Let me compute the length of AE and AD, which are both r. So triangle ADE has sides AD = AE = r, DE = 7. So it's an isoceles triangle with sides r, r, 7. Applying the Law of Cosines:

DE² = AD² + AE² - 2*AD*AE*cos(angle DAE). So:

7² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(angle DAE) → 49 = 2r²(1 - cos(angle DAE)).

But angle DAE is the angle at A between AD and AE. Not sure if that helps.

But also, since AX is the hypotenuse of the right triangles ADX and AEX, and AX is the same in both. So AX = sqrt(r² + 24²). If we can find r, then we can find AX.

But how to find r? Let's recall that from the chord DE, we have DE = 7 = 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Also, from the power of point X, we have XQ² = r² + 576. And from the coordinates approach, we couldn't resolve r.

Wait, let's try to link the two. Let's say that the central angle theta corresponds to arc DE. The angle at A, angle DAE, is half of the central angle, because it's an inscribed angle. Wait, no: angle DAE is an inscribed angle subtending arc DE, so it would be half of the central angle theta. So, angle DAE = theta/2. 

From the Law of Cosines in triangle ADE:

49 = 2r²(1 - cos(theta)) → since theta is the central angle, and from the Law of Cosines in triangle DQE, we also have DE² = 2r²(1 - cos(theta)).

Wait, yes, that's the same as the previous equation. So, 49 = 2r²(1 - cos(theta)).

But how to relate this to the other parts? Perhaps using the fact that AX is related to the triangle ADX and AEX.

Alternatively, let's
