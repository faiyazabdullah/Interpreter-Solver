MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have a circle M with several points on it: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P. All these points lie on the circle since the PointLiesOnCircle predicates are given for each. Then there are lines connecting some of these points: FL, HJ, NJ, ML, MN, HP. Also, there are right angles at angles FLM, HJM, and NJM. The lengths of FL is 24, HJ is 48. The measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. Additionally, ML and MN are radii because they're stated as IsRadiusOf. Also, ML bisects the angle FLM and MN bisects the angle HJM. 

Wait, the question asks for NJ. So, NJ is a chord? Since N and J are points on the circle, so NJ would be a chord of the circle. But how do we find its length?

Let me start by recalling that in a circle, the length of a chord relates to the central angle subtended by the chord. The formula for chord length is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle and R is the radius. Alternatively, if we know the arc measure, which is the central angle, we can use that. 

But first, let's note that ML and MN are radii. So ML and MN are both radii of the circle. Therefore, ML = MN = R. Wait, but ML is a radius, so point M is the center? Because ML connects M to L, which is on the circle, making ML a radius. Similarly, MN is another radius. So M is the center of the circle. That's crucial. So M is the center, and ML and MN are radii. Therefore, L and N are points on the circle, and ML and MN are radii, so LM = MN = R. 

Now, looking at the lines FL, HJ, NJ. FL is a chord of the circle since it's mentioned as IsChordOf. Similarly for HJ and NJ. Given that FL has length 24, HJ has length 48. We need to find NJ. 

Also, there are right angles at angles FLM, HJM, and NJM. Let me think about those. For example, angle FLM is a right angle. Since M is the center, and L is on the circle, and F is also on the circle. So FL is a chord, and ML is a radius. The angle at L between F and M being a right angle suggests that triangle FLM is a right triangle with the right angle at L. Wait, because angle FLM is the angle at point L between points F, L, M. So, triangle FLM has a right angle at L. Similarly for the others. 

So, triangle FLM is right-angled at L. Therefore, by Pythagoras, FL² + LM² = FM². But wait, since M is the center, and L is on the circle, LM is the radius R. FL is given as 24, so substituting, 24² + R² = FM². However, FM is the distance from F to M. Since F is on the circle, FM is the radius as well? No, wait. Wait, F is on the circle, so the distance from F to M is the radius. Wait, no. Wait, if M is the center, then every point on the circle is at distance R from M. So FM is R. Therefore, FM = R. But then FL² + LM² = FM² becomes 24² + R² = R², which implies 24² = 0, which is impossible. So something's wrong here. Maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the right angle isn't between FL and ML, but perhaps the angle at L is between FL and LM. Let me visualize. Points F, L, M. Line FL connects F and L, and line LM connects L and M. So angle at L between F-L-M. So yes, that's angle FLM. So triangle FLM has sides FL, LM, and FM. With right angle at L. So according to Pythagoras: FL² + LM² = FM². But since M is the center, LM is R, FM is the distance from F to M, which is also R. Therefore, substituting gives 24² + R² = R² → 24² = 0, which is impossible. This contradiction suggests an error in my assumptions. 

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check again. The problem says that RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)). So the angle at L between F, L, M. So triangle FLM has a right angle at L. But if M is the center, then LM is a radius, and FL is a chord. So FM would be the distance from F to M, which should be R. So FL^2 + LM^2 = FM^2 leads to FL^2 + R^2 = R^2 ⇒ FL=0, which can't be. Therefore, my assumption that M is the center must be wrong. Wait, but the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)), meaning that ML is a radius. Therefore, M must be the center. Otherwise, how can ML be a radius? Unless there's another interpretation. Wait, maybe Line(M,L) is a radius, implying that M is one endpoint and L is the other. Therefore, M is the center, and L is on the circle. Hence, ML is a radius. So that part seems correct. 

Then why does the right angle lead to a contradiction? Maybe the triangle isn't formed by those three points? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding of the angle. Let me consider coordinates. Suppose M is at (0,0). Let’s place point L somewhere on the circle. Let’s say L is at (R, 0). Then line ML is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (R, 0). Now, point F is another point on the circle such that angle FLM is a right angle. So, the angle at L between points F, L, M. So vectors LF and LM. Since L is at (R,0), M is at (0,0), so vector LM is (-R, 0). Vector LF would be from L to F. If angle at L is 90 degrees, then vectors LF and LM are perpendicular. So their dot product is zero. 

Let’s denote coordinates. Let’s suppose L is (R, 0). Let F be some point on the circle. The vector LF is (F_x - R, F_y - 0). The vector LM is (0 - R, 0 - 0) = (-R, 0). Their dot product is (F_x - R)(-R) + (F_y)(0) = -R(F_x - R) = 0. So -R(F_x - R) = 0 ⇒ F_x = R. But since F is on the circle centered at M (origin), the equation is x² + y² = R². If F_x = R, then substituting into the circle equation gives R² + y² = R² ⇒ y² = 0 ⇒ y=0. Thus, F would be (R,0), same as L. Which is impossible because FL would have length zero. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding. How can there be a right angle at L between F, L, M? It seems impossible unless F coincides with L, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the right angle is not between FL and LM, but between different lines? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)), which means the angle at L between F, L, M. So it's the angle between LF and LM. But according to the previous calculation, that requires F to coincide with L, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at L but at another point? No, the notation Angle(F,L,M) denotes the angle at L. So the angle is at L between F and M. So the angle between FL and LM. But as shown earlier, that leads to a contradiction. 

Wait, could there be another configuration where this holds? Let me try with coordinates again. Suppose M is at origin (0,0), L is at (R,0). Let me take a general point F on the circle. Coordinates of F satisfy x² + y² = R². The angle at L between FL and LM is 90 degrees. Let me compute the slope of FL and LM. 

Vector LM goes from L(R,0) to M(0,0): direction (-R, 0). Vector LF goes from L(R,0) to F(x,y): (x-R, y). These two vectors must be perpendicular. Their dot product is (-R)(x-R) + 0*(y) = -R(x - R) = 0 ⇒ x = R. As before, leading to F being (R,0). Which is same as L. Not possible. 

Therefore, the only way for the angle at L to be 90 degrees is if F coincides with L, which is invalid. Hence, there must be an error in my initial assumptions. 

Wait, perhaps ML is not a radius? But the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)), so Line(M,L) is a radius. Therefore, M is the center, and L is on the circle. So ML is a radius. So this seems correct. 

Alternative possibility: Maybe the angle is not at L but at another point? Like, maybe the angle is at M? But the notation Angle(F,L,M) indicates the vertex is L. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the angle. Let me check the original problem statement again. 

The given predicates include RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)), RightAngle(Angle(H,J,M)), RightAngle(Angle(N,J,M)). So each of these angles is at the middle letter. So Angle(F,L,M) is angle at L between F, L, M. Same for others. 

Given that, and the fact that ML is a radius, the only way for the angle at L to be 90 degrees is if FL is tangent to the circle at L. Wait! Because if FL is tangent to the circle at L, then ML (the radius) is perpendicular to FL. That would make angle FLM a right angle. Yes! That makes sense. 

Ah! So FL is tangent to the circle at L. Therefore, the line FL is tangent to the circle at point L, making ML perpendicular to FL. Therefore, triangle FLM is right-angled at L. But wait, FL is tangent, so ML is perpendicular to FL. Therefore, angle FLM is 90 degrees. 

But FL is a chord? Wait, the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(F,L), Circle(M)). So FL is a chord. But if FL is tangent at L, then it cannot be a chord because a tangent touches at one point. So there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, the predicate says IsChordOf(Line(F,L), Circle(M)). So the line segment FL is a chord of the circle. Therefore, points F and L are both on the circle, so FL is a chord. But if FL were tangent at L, then L would be the only intersection point, which contradicts FL being a chord (which requires two distinct endpoints on the circle). 

So this is confusing. There must be a resolution. Let me re-examine the premises. 

We have Line(F,L) is a chord of the circle, so F and L are points on the circle. Line(M,L) is a radius, so M is the center, and L is on the circle. So ML is a radius. The angle at L between F, L, M is a right angle. So angle FLM is 90 degrees. 

But if F and L are both on the circle, and ML is a radius, then the triangle FLM has sides FL, LM, and FM. Since F and L are on the circle, FM is also a radius (since F is on the circle). Wait, FM is from F to M, which is the radius. So FM = LM = R. Then in triangle FLM, we have two sides equal to R and the third side FL. And angle at L is 90 degrees. 

Using Pythagoras: FL² + LM² = FM². But FM = LM = R. So FL² + R² = R² ⇒ FL² = 0 ⇒ FL = 0, which is impossible. So this suggests that there's a contradiction unless FL is zero, which can't be. 

This implies that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a misinterpretation. Let me check the original problem again. 

Wait, the problem states that Line(F,L) is a chord, and that Line(M,L) is a radius. So FL is a chord, so F and L are distinct points on the circle. ML is a radius. The angle at L between F, L, M is a right angle. So perhaps the triangle is not FLM but another triangle? Or maybe the angle is not between FL and ML, but between other segments? 

Wait, angle FLM is the angle at L between F and M. So it's formed by the lines LF and LM. So if ML is a radius, and FL is a chord, then the angle between them is 90 degrees. 

But how can that happen? Let me consider coordinates again. Let me assume M is at (0,0), L is at (R,0). Then ML is along x-axis. Let me choose F such that angle FLM is 90 degrees. So the line LF is perpendicular to ML. Since ML is horizontal, LF must be vertical. So from point L(R,0), moving vertically up or down. So F would be at (R, y), but since F is on the circle centered at M(0,0), plugging into x² + y² = R². For point F(R, y), we get R² + y² = R² ⇒ y=0. So F would be (R,0), which is same as L. Again, impossible. 

So this suggests that the only way for angle FLM to be 90 degrees is if F is at L, which is not allowed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, could the angle be at M instead of L? If the angle was at M, then it would make sense. For instance, if the angle is at M between F, M, L, then that would be angle FML. But the given predicate is Angle(F,L,M), which is angle at L. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and the angle is supposed to be at M? Or maybe the line is different? 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between FL and ML, but between other lines. Let me check the original predicates again. 

The given predicates are: 
RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)) — angle at L between F, L, M.
RightAngle(Angle(H,J,M)) — angle at J between H, J, M.
RightAngle(Angle(N,J,M)) — angle at J between N, J, M.

So for angle at J between H, J, M and N, J, M. So similar to the first case. 

If angle at J between H, J, M is 90 degrees, then similar logic applies. For example, if MJ is a radius, and HJ is a chord, then angle at J between H, J, M would require HJ to be tangent to the circle at J. But HJ is a chord, which implies H and J are both on the circle. So again, similar contradiction. 

Wait, unless MJ is not a radius? But the predicate says IsRadiusOf(Line(M,J), Circle(M))? Wait, no. Looking back, the predicates mention IsRadiusOf(Line(M,L), Circle(M)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(M,N), Circle(M)). So ML and MN are radii. What about MJ? Is MJ a radius? The problem doesn't state that explicitly. So perhaps MJ is not a radius, but rather, the line HMJ is something else. 

Wait, let's focus on the angle at J between H, J, M. So angle HJM is 90 degrees. So in triangle HJM, angle at J is 90 degrees. If MJ is not a radius, but perhaps HM is a radius? Wait, the line HJ is a chord. So H and J are on the circle. If angle at J is 90 degrees between H, J, M, then similar to before, JM would be a radius? 

Wait, if angle HJM is 9'th degree, then JM is perpendicular to HJ. So if HJ is a chord, then JM is perpendicular to HJ at J. That would mean that JM is the radius perpendicular to the chord HJ. In that case, JM is the perpendicular from the center to the chord HJ. Wait, but in that case, M would be the midpoint of the perpendicular from the center to the chord. But since HJ is a chord, the perpendicular from the center to the chord passes through the midpoint of the chord. However, if JM is that perpendicular, then J would be the midpoint of HJ? No, because the perpendicular from the center to the chord passes through the midpoint of the chord. So if JM is perpendicular to HJ at J, then J would be the midpoint of HJ? Only if HJ is of zero length, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe M is the center, and JM is the perpendicular from the center to the chord HJ. But then the midpoint of HJ would be the foot of the perpendicular from M to HJ. But in this case, since angle at J is 90 degrees, then JM is perpendicular to HJ, meaning that M lies on the perpendicular to HJ at J. But if M is the center, then this implies that the perpendicular from M to HJ passes through J, which would mean that J is the midpoint of HJ? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, if JM is perpendicular to HJ at J, then M lies on the line perpendicular to HJ at J. But since HJ is a chord, the center M must lie on the perpendicular bisector of HJ. But if M is on the perpendicular to HJ at J, then the perpendicular bisector of HJ is the line that passes through J and is perpendicular to HJ. But the center M would be on this line. However, the midpoint of HJ is not necessarily J unless HJ is a degenerate chord. 

This seems very tangled. Let me try to approach this differently. 

Since FL is a chord of length 24, and it's connected to a right angle at L. If I consider that angle FLM is 90 degrees, then FL is tangent to the circle at L. But FL is a chord, which can't be tangent. So this is conflicting. 

Maybe the problem involves more than just the circle. Are there other elements like triangles or other circles? The problem mentions various points, but it's mainly about the circle M. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angles imply that certain lines are tangents or altitudes. 

Wait, considering FL is a chord, and there's a right angle at L. If we consider the tangent at L, then the tangent is perpendicular to the radius ML. So if FL is the tangent, then FL would be perpendicular to ML. But FL is a chord, not a tangent. So this is contradictory. 

Unless the chord FL is actually the tangent, which would require L to be the only intersection point, but since F is another point on the circle, FL would intersect the circle at L and F, making it a secant, not a tangent. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other clues. 

Another given is MeasureOf(Arc(H,P)) = 65 degrees. So the arc from H to P measures 65 degrees. Also, there's a line HP, which is mentioned as IsChordOf. So HP is a chord. 

Additionally, there's a BisectsAngle(Line(M,L), Angle(F,L,M)). So line ML bisects angle FLM. But angle FLM is already a right angle, so the bisector divides it into two 45-degree angles. 

Similarly, line MN bisects angle HJM. 

Let me try to use these bisectors. 

Starting with angle FLM being 90 degrees, and ML bisecting it. So the bisector splits it into two 45-degree angles. So angle FML is 45 degrees. 

But how does that help? 

Alternatively, since ML is the bisector of angle FLM, and angle FLM is 90 degrees, then the bisector creates two angles of 45 degrees. 

But if ML is the bisector, then it splits angle FLM into two equal parts. 

But if angle FLM is 90 degrees, then the bisector would make angles of 45 degrees. 

However, without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard to proceed. 

Perhaps I should consider power of a point. If FL is a chord, and ML is a radius, but angle at L is 90 degrees, then maybe there's a relation between FL and the radius. 

Wait, if FL is a chord and ML is a radius, and angle at L is 90 degrees, then maybe applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangle FLM, even though it led to a contradiction. Let's see: 

FL = 24, LM = R (radius). FM = ? 

From triangle FLM, right-angled at L: FL² + LM² = FM². 

But FM is the distance from F to M. Since F is on the circle, FM = R. So substituting:

24² + R² = R² → 24² = 0 → contradiction. 

This suggests that either the problem has inconsistent data, or my interpretation is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not in triangle FLM, but in some other triangle? 

Wait, the angle is at L, so it's part of triangle FLM. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not between FL and ML, but between other lines? 

Wait, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)), which is the angle at L between F and M. So it's between LF and LM. 

Another thought: Could the points be arranged such that FL is not a straight line? No, FL is a line segment. 

At this point, I might need to consider that there's a misprint or error in the problem, but assuming it's correctly formulated, perhaps I need to think differently. 

Let me try to ignore the contradiction for a moment and proceed. Assume that the angle at L is 90 degrees, so FL is tangent. Even though FL is supposed to be a chord, maybe it's a tangent. If that's the case, then the length of the tangent from F to the circle at L would be FL = 24. But since F is on the circle, the tangent from F would have length zero. This is still contradictory. 

Alternatively, perhaps FL is a secant, but the angle is at L. 

Wait, if FL is a secant passing through L and F, and ML is a radius, then the angle between FL and ML is 90 degrees. This would mean that ML is perpendicular to FL. So FL is tangent at L, but F is another point on the circle. This is impossible, as explained. 

Maybe the problem uses a different type of circle or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is not Euclidean? Unlikely. 

This is very confusing. Maybe I should move to other parts of the problem and see if I can find relations elsewhere. 

Given that HJ is 48, and there's a right angle at J between H, J, M. Similar to the FL case. 

Assuming that angle HJM is 90 degrees, and line MJ is perpendicular to HJ. So MJ is perpendicular to HJ at J. This would mean that MJ is the perpendicular from M to HJ, implying that M lies on the perpendicular to HJ at J. Since HJ is a chord, the perpendicular from the center to the chord passes through the midpoint of the chord. So if M is on this perpendicular, then the midpoint of HJ is the foot of the perpendicular from M to HJ. 

But since angle at J is 90 degrees, this would mean that J is the midpoint of HJ? No, because the midpoint would be the foot of the perpendicular. So if MJ is perpendicular to HJ at J, then J is the midpoint of HJ. But that would mean HJ has length 0, which is impossible. 

Again, contradiction. 

But wait, if HJ is a chord of length 48, and MJ is perpendicular to HJ at J, then J is the midpoint of HJ? No, because the midpoint would be the foot of the perpendicular from M to HJ. So if M is the center, then the perpendicular from M to HJ would pass through the midpoint of HJ. But if MJ is that perpendicular, then J is the midpoint of HJ. But then HJ's midpoint is J, so HJ has length twice the distance from J to H. Wait, if J is the midpoint, then HJ would have length 2*JH. But HJ is given as 48, so JH is 24. But then the length from J to H is 24, and from J to M is...? 

Wait, if MJ is perpendicular to HJ at J, then triangle HJM is a right triangle with legs HJ and MJ, and hypotenuse MH. 

But HJ is 48, and MJ is the distance from M to J. Since J is on the circle, MJ is a radius R. So in triangle HJM, right-angled at J: HJ² + MJ² = MH². But MH is the distance from M to H, which is also a radius R. So 48² + R² = R² → 48² = 0 → contradiction. 

Same issue as before. 

This suggests that the problem has inconsistencies, or there's a fundamental misunderstanding. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not at J but at M? If the angle is at M between H, J, M, then it would be angle HJM, which is not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is at M between H, M, J. But the predicate is Angle(H,J,M), which is at J. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that despite the contradictions, there's a way to proceed with the given data. 

For example, assuming that in triangle FLM, right-angled at L, even though it leads to FL=0. But since FL is given as 24, perhaps there's a different relationship. 

Wait, if ML is a radius R, and FL is a chord of length 24, then in the right triangle FLM, we have FL = 24, LM = R, and FM = sqrt(FL² + LM²) = sqrt(24² + R²). But since F is on the circle, FM should be R. So sqrt(24² + R²) = R → 24² + R² = R² → 24² = 0. Still impossible. 

This suggests that the only way this works is if FL is not a chord, but a tangent. But FL is a chord. 

Wait, maybe FL is a diameter? If FL is a diameter, then its length would be 2R. But FL is given as 24, so R = 12. But then, if angle FLM is 90 degrees, and ML is a radius, then in triangle FLM, FL is diameter (24), LM is radius (12). So FM would be the hypotenuse, which would be sqrt(24² + 12²) = sqrt(576 + 144) = sqrt(720) ≈ 26.83. But FM is the distance from F to M, which should be R = 12 if F is on the circle. Contradiction. 

Nope. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I should abandon the triangle approach and consider other aspects. 

The arc measure from H to P is 65 degrees. So the central angle corresponding to arc HP is 65 degrees. Therefore, the angle at M between H and P is 65 degrees. 

Since HP is a chord, and M is the center, the length of HP can be found using the chord length formula: 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So HP = 2R sin(65°/2). 

But I don't know R yet. 

Also, there's a line HP, which is a chord. 

But how does this help with finding NJ? 

Perhaps I need to relate the arcs and chords. 

Alternatively, since there are bisectors of angles at L and J, maybe there's a relationship between the arcs. 

For example, the bisector of angle FLM (which is 90 degrees) would split it into two 45-degree angles. This might relate to arcs. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since ML bisects angle FLM, and angle FLM is 90 degrees, the bisector divides it into 45 degrees. This might mean that the arc from F to some point is related to this angle. 

But I'm not seeing it. 

Maybe I should try to find the radius R using the given data. 

If I assume that despite the contradictions, there's a way to calculate R. 

For example, taking the FL = 24, and assuming that in triangle FLM, right-angled at L, even though it leads to FL=0. But perhaps there's another relationship. 

Wait, if ML is a radius R, and FL is 24, then in the right triangle, FL is the leg opposite to angle at M. Wait, no. Let me label the triangle properly. 

Triangle FLM, right-angled at L. So sides: 

- FL = 24 (opposite angle at M)

- LM = R (adjacent to angle at M)

- FM = hypotenuse, which is R (since F is on the circle).

Wait, but then using trigonometry: sin(angle at M) = opposite/hypotenuse = FL / FM = 24/R. But angle at M is complementary to angle at L, which is 90 degrees. Wait, in a right triangle, angles sum to 180. So angle at M + angle at L + angle at F = 180. Angle at L is 90, so angle at M + angle at F = 90. 

But angle at M is angle FLM? No, angle at M is angle FLM? No, in triangle FLM, the angles are at F, L, M. 

Wait, angle at M is angle FMB, where B is the other point. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Maybe I should give up on this part and try to use the arc measure. 

Arc HP is 65 degrees, so central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees. 

If I can find the length of HP, it would be 2R sin(65°/2). But I don't know R. 

But perhaps there's a relationship between HP and other chords. 

Alternatively, since there are bisectors of angles at L and J, and the arcs, maybe there's a way to relate the arcs to the angles. 

Alternatively, since ML and MN are radii, and they bisect the angles at L and J respectively, perhaps these bisectors relate to arcs. 

For example, the bisector of angle FLM (which is 90 degrees) would divide it into two 45-degree angles. In circle geometry, an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But here, angle FLM is a right angle, which would mean that the arc it intercepts is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. But here, if FL is tangent at L, then angle between tangent FL and chord LH would be half the measure of the arc from H to the point of tangency. But in our case, FL is not a tangent, but a chord. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for another approach. 

Let me recall that in the problem, NJ is asked. Since N and J are points on the circle, NJ is a chord. If I can find the central angle corresponding to arc NJ, then I can find its length. 

To find the central angle, perhaps I can relate it to other arcs. 

Given that arc HP is 65 degrees, and there may be other arcs related to the angles. 

Also, the bisected angles at L and J might correspond to arcs. 

For example, the bisector of angle FLM (right angle) divides it into two 45-degree angles. Each of these angles would correspond to an arc. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since ML is the bisector of angle FLM, which is 90 degrees, then the bisector divides it into 45 degrees. This might relate to the arcs subtended by certain chords. 

But I'm stuck. 

Maybe I should try to assign variables and set up equations. 

Let R be the radius of the circle. 

From the FL chord: FL = 24. Assuming it's a chord, the length is 2√(R² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. But since FL is a chord, and if there's a right angle at L, perhaps this distance is related to the radius. 

Wait, but earlier attempts showed contradictions. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the right angle at L implies that FL is tangent, then the length of the tangent from F to the circle would be FL = 24. But since F is on the circle, the tangent length from F is zero. So this is impossible. 

This suggests that the problem has no solution under standard geometric assumptions, or there's a trick I'm missing. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between FL and ML, but between other lines? For example, maybe the angle is at L between F and some other line? 

Wait, the predicate is RightAngle(Angle(F,L,M)), which is the angle at L between F and M. So it must be between FL and LM. 

At this point, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that there is a way to resolve this, possibly by ignoring the contradiction and proceeding with the given data. 

Let's assume that despite the apparent contradiction, we can proceed. 

For example, in triangle FLM, right-angled at L, with FL = 24, LM = R, and FM = R. So from Pythagoras: 24² + R² = R² → 24 = 0, which is impossible. But if I pretend that this is possible, then R is infinite, which is not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at M? If the angle is at M between F, L, M, then it would be angle FLM, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at F? No, the angle is at L. 

This is extremely confusing. Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to recognize that FL and HJ are chords, with FL = 24, HJ = 48, and since HJ is double FL, and the arc HP is 65 degrees, which might relate to the central angle. 

But how? 

Alternatively, since HJ is 48, and it's a chord, the central angle over HJ would be θ, so HJ = 2R sin(θ/2). Similarly, FL = 2R sin(φ/2), where φ is the central angle for FL. 

If I can find the relationship between these angles, maybe via the bisected angles. 

But without knowing the central angles, this is difficult. 

Wait, the bisector of angle HJM (at J) is MN. Since angle HJM is 90 degrees, the bisector divides it into 45 degrees. This might mean that the central angle over some arc is 45 degrees. 

Alternatively, the bisector MN creates an angle of 45 degrees, which could relate to the arcs. 

But I'm not sure. 

Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I should look for patterns in the answer choices. The options are 24, 32, 48, 65. 

Since HJ is 48, and NJ is asked, maybe it's 32, which is the geometric mean of 24 and 48. Or 48, or 65. 

Alternatively, since arc HP is 65 degrees, and if there's a relationship between the arcs, maybe NJ corresponds to an arc that is related to 65 degrees. 

But without knowing the exact relationships, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since ML and MN are radii, and they bisect the angles at L and J, which are 90 degrees, maybe there's a relationship between the chords FL and HJ. 

If FL = 24 and HJ = 48, and they are related through some factor, perhaps NJ is 32, which is the geometric mean of 24 and 48 (sqrt(24*48) = sqrt(1152) = 33.94, close to 32). But not exact. 

Or maybe NJ is 48, same as HJ. 

Alternatively, since the arc HP is 65 degrees, and if there's a relationship between that and the arc NJ, but I don't see it. 

Given the options, and assuming that NJ is related to the other chords, maybe it's 32. 

But this is pure guesswork. 

Alternatively, since FL is 24 and HJ is 48, and if NJ is a median or something, maybe it's 32. 

But without proper reasoning, this is risky. 

Given that I'm stuck, I'll hazard a guess that the answer is B. 32.
