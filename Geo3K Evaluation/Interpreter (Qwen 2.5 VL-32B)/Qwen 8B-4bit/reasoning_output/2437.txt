MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup.

So, we have points Z, V, Y, W, X. There's a circle X, and two lines: Line(Z,V) and Line(Y,W). Both of these lines are diameters of the same circle X. That means points Z and V are endpoints of one diameter, and Y and W are endpoints of another diameter. Since they're diameters, they pass through the center of the circle. 

Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(Z,X,V) and Angle(Y,X,W). These angles are at point X, with sides connecting to Z-V and Y-W respectively. Also, there's an equation involving the measures of these angles: the sum of their measures equals 360 degrees. Wait, but angles in a circle... Hmm, maybe those angles are related to arcs?

Wait, the measure of each angle is given in terms of x. The first angle, MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) = 2x + 65, and the second is 4x + 15. Their sum is 360. So adding them together gives 2x + 65 + 4x + 15 = 6x + 80 = 360. Solving for x would give 6x = 280 → x = 280 / 6 ≈ 46.666... But wait, maybe I should check if that makes sense.

But before jumping into equations, let me think about the geometric implications. Since both lines ZV and YW are diameters of the circle, they intersect at the center X. Therefore, point X is the center of the circle. So, angles at X formed by these diameters... Let me visualize this. If two diameters intersect at the center, they form vertical angles. Each pair of opposite angles would be equal. However, the angles given here are Angle(Z,X,V) and Angle(Y,X,W). Wait, how are these angles positioned?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points Z and V are endpoints of a diameter, so line ZV passes through the center X. Similarly, Y and W are endpoints of another diameter passing through X. So, the lines ZV and YW cross at X. Now, Angle(Z,X,V) is the angle at X between points Z, X, V. But since ZV is a straight line (a diameter), the angle between Z and V at X would actually be a straight angle, 180 degrees. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the angle is given as 2x+65. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, maybe the angle isn't between Z-X-V as a straight line. Wait, in standard notation, Angle(Z,X,V) refers to the angle at point X, with segments XZ and XV. But since Z and V are endpoints of a diameter, X is the midpoint, so XZ and XV are radii in opposite directions. Therefore, the angle between XZ and XV would be a straight angle, 180 degrees. But according to the given, it's 2x + 65. This suggests that there's something wrong here. Unless the angle isn't between ZX and VX, but maybe some other configuration?

Wait, perhaps the angle isn't at X? No, the notation Angle(Z,X,V) means vertex at X. So maybe there's a typo in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between Z-X-V as a straight line but instead part of a different structure. Wait, but if ZV is a diameter, then points Z, X, V are colinear. So, the angle at X between Z and V would be a straight line. Therefore, the measure should be 180 degrees. But according to the given, it's 2x + 65. That implies that maybe the angle isn't between Z and V, but perhaps between other points?

Alternatively, could there be a misinterpretation of the angle's vertices? For example, maybe Angle(Z,X,V) is referring to a different angle. Wait, maybe the angle is formed by lines Z-X and X-V, but since Z and V are on a straight line through X, that angle would be 180 degrees. So unless there's some other construction here.

Wait, but the problem also mentions another angle: Angle(V,X,W). Which is the angle at X between V, X, W. So, that's another angle at the center. Given that lines ZV and YW are diameters, so points Y and W are on another diameter. So, the four points Z, V, Y, W are all on the circle, with X being the center. So, the angles at X would depend on the positions of these points.

Wait, but if two diameters intersect at X, they form four angles around the center. The sum of all angles around a point is 360 degrees. So, if there are two diameters crossing, they divide the plane into four angles, which add up to 360 degrees. So, perhaps the given angles are two of those four angles?

But the problem states that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) and MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)) is 360 degrees. Wait, that seems like the sum of two angles equals 360. But normally, around a point, the total is 360. So if two angles are adjacent and form a full rotation, their sum would be 360. However, if they are opposite angles, their sum would be half of that. Wait, this needs clarification.

Let me re-examine the given equations. The measure of Angle(Z,X,V) is 2x + 65, and the measure of Angle(Y,X,W) is 4x + 15. Their sum is 360. So:

(2x + 65) + (4x + 15) = 360  
→ 6x + 80 = 360  
→ 6x = 280  
→ x = 280 / 6 = 46.666...

Hmm, but this leads to fractional degrees. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps my interpretation of the angles is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angles aren't adjacent. Suppose that the two angles given are vertical angles? Wait, vertical angles are equal. But in that case, their sum wouldn't be 360. Wait, but maybe the angles are supplementary? Or maybe they are parts of the total 360 around the point X.

Wait, if two diameters intersect at X, creating four angles. Let's say one angle is α and its vertical opposite is α, and the other two angles are β and β. Then α + β = 180 degrees. But the sum of all four angles is 360. So if the given angles are α and β, their sum would be 180, not 360. So that contradicts the given equation where their sum is 360. Hence, my initial assumption must be wrong.

Therefore, there's a contradiction here, implying that my understanding of the angles' positions is incorrect. Let me reconsider the angle definitions.

Perhaps the angles mentioned are not the ones directly between the diameters but involve other points. Wait, the problem says "Angle(Z,X,V)" – so that's angle at X between Z and V. But since Z and V are endpoints of a diameter, that angle is a straight angle, 180 degrees. So why does the problem state that it's equal to 2x + 65? This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the angle's definition.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between Z and V but between other lines. Wait, maybe the angle is formed by another configuration. For example, maybe it's not the angle between Z-X and V-X, but between Z-X and another segment. Wait, but the notation Angle(Z,X,V) typically means the angle at X between Z and V. So maybe there's a different configuration.

Alternatively, could the lines ZV and YW not be diameters but just lines that are diameters? Wait, the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(Z,V), Circle(X)). So Line(Z,V) is a diameter of Circle(X). Similarly for Line(Y,W). Thus, ZV and YW are both diameters, so they both pass through the center X. Therefore, X is the center of the circle. So points Z, V, Y, W are all on the circle, and X is the center. Therefore, ZV and YW are two diameters intersecting at X.

Now, considering that, the angle at X between Z and V is 180 degrees, as ZV is a straight line. Similarly for Y and W. But according to the given, those angles are 2x + 65 and 4x + 15. So this seems conflicting. Unless the angles are not between Z and V but between other points. Wait, perhaps the angles are not between the entire diameters but between different segments?

Wait, maybe the angle is not between Z-X and V-X, but between Z-X and another line? Like, maybe Angle(Z,X,V) is not between ZX and VX, but between ZX and some other line connected to V? That doesn't make sense with standard notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by three points where X is the vertex, but the sides are not the diameters. For instance, if there's a triangle involved. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any triangles except through the angles. 

This confusion suggests that perhaps I need to consider that the angles mentioned are not the angles between the diameters themselves, but angles formed by other lines. For example, maybe there are triangles formed by connecting points Z, X, V and others. Wait, but without more information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not at the center X, but somewhere else? But the notation specifies the middle letter as the vertex, so Angle(Z,X,V) is definitely at X. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the circle's role. The circle is named X, which is also a point. Wait, the predicates include Point(X) and Circle(X). Oh! Wait, the circle is named X. So, the circle is called X, and there's also a point X. That's confusing. So the circle is labeled as X, and there's a point also named X. So, the center of the circle is point X. Because diameters pass through the center. So, the line ZV is a diameter of the circle X, which means it passes through the center X. Similarly for YW. Therefore, points Z, V, Y, W lie on the circumference of circle X, and X is the center. 

Thus, the line ZV is a diameter, so Z and V are on the circle, and X is the midpoint of ZV. Similarly for Y and W. 

Now, considering that, the angle at X between Z and V would still be a straight angle (since Z and V are on opposite ends of the diameter). But according to the problem, that angle is 2x + 65. How is this possible?

Wait, unless the angle is not between Z and V, but between Z and another point. For example, maybe the angle is between Z and X and another point? Wait, but the notation Angle(Z,X,V) is the angle at X, formed by points Z, X, V. So, that would mean the angle between XZ and XV. But since ZV is a diameter, X is the midpoint, so XZ and XV are in opposite directions, making the angle between them 180 degrees. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem's given data. Unless the problem uses non-standard notation or there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between Z and V, but between Z and another line. Wait, maybe the angle is part of a triangle involving other points. For example, if there's a triangle ZXY or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves inscribed angles? Wait, but inscribed angles relate to arcs. However, the given angles seem to be central angles since their vertex is at the center of the circle. Central angles have measures equal to the measure of their arc. 

Wait, if Angle(Z,X,V) is a central angle, then its measure is equal to the measure of the arc ZV. Since ZV is a diameter, the arc ZV would be 180 degrees. So again, this conflicts with the given expression 2x + 65. 

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle's position. Let me consider another possibility: maybe the angle is not between Z and V but between other segments. For example, maybe Angle(Z,X,V) is the angle at X between Z and another point, not V? But that would change the notation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angles are supposed to be inscribed angles rather than central angles. But that's speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by connecting other points. For example, suppose there's a triangle ZXY, and the angle at X is Angle(Z,X,Y), but the problem says Angle(Z,X,V). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves multiple circles or other configurations. 

Given this confusion, perhaps I need to proceed with the algebraic approach, assuming that the equations given are correct, even if the geometric interpretation seems conflicting. 

So, from the equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) = 2x + 65  
MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)) = 4x + 15  
Sum = 360  

Adding them: 6x + 80 = 360 → x = (360 - 80)/6 = 280/6 = 46.666... 

But this leads to fractional degrees. However, perhaps the angles are not central angles but inscribed angles. Let's explore that possibility. 

If Angle(Z,X,V) were an inscribed angle, but inscribed angles require the vertex to be on the circumference. However, in this case, the vertex is X, which is the center. So that would make it a central angle. 

Wait, unless the angle is formed by two chords meeting at X, but X is the center. So, yes, it's a central angle. 

So, if the measure of the central angle is 2x + 65, and it corresponds to an arc. Since ZV is a diameter, the arc ZV is 180 degrees. So 2x + 65 = 180 → 2x = 115 → x = 57.5. But this would conflict with the other equation. 

Similarly, for Angle(Y,X,W): if it's a central angle corresponding to arc YW, which is also a diameter, so 180 degrees. Then 4x + 15 = 180 → 4x = 165 → x = 41.25. Contradiction. 

Hence, this suggests that the given angles are not central angles. 

Alternative idea: Perhaps the angles are not central angles but angles formed by other lines. For example, maybe the lines ZV and YW are not diameters but secants, and the angles are formed by intersecting chords. 

Wait, the problem explicitly states that Line(Z,V) and Line(Y,W) are diameters of Circle(X), so they must pass through the center. So, the intersection point of ZV and YW is the center X. 

Therefore, the angles at X are formed by the intersection of two diameters, creating vertical angles. So, there are four angles around X: two pairs of vertical angles. 

Suppose that Angle(Z,X,V) is one of those angles, and Angle(Y,X,W) is another. Depending on their positions, their sum could be 360 if they are adjacent, forming a full rotation. Wait, but around a point, the sum of all angles is 360. If two angles are adjacent and form a full rotation, their sum would be 360. But that would imply they are supplementary if they are adjacent and form a straight line. 

Wait, but if two diameters intersect at X, they create four angles. For example, imagine two lines crossing at X, making four angles. Let's call them α, β, γ, δ. Typically, α = γ, β = δ, and α + β = 180 degrees. So the sum of all four angles is 360. 

Now, if the given angles are two of these four, say α and β, their sum would be 180 degrees. But the problem states that their sum is 360. Hence, this suggests that the two angles are not adjacent but are opposite each other, each being one of the pairs. Wait, if α and γ are opposite angles, then their sum would be α + γ = 2α. But unless α is 180, which would make the sum 360. 

Ah! If the two angles given are opposite each other, each being 180 degrees, their sum would be 360. But that would mean that each angle is 180 degrees. But according to the given expressions, they are 2x + 65 and 4x + 15. Setting each equal to 180:

For 2x + 65 = 180 → x = (180 - 65)/2 = 115/2 = 57.5  
For 4x + 15 = 180 → x = (180 - 15)/4 = 165/4 = 41.25  

These don't match, so this scenario is invalid. 

Another thought: Perhaps the angles given are not the angles formed by the diameters but angles formed by other lines. For example, maybe the lines ZV and YW are diameters, but there are other lines or points involved. 

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(V,X,W). So, this angle is at X between V and W. Since V and W are points on the circle, and X is the center. So, the angle between XV and XW. Since XV and XW are radii, the angle between them depends on the arc VW. 

So, if we know the measure of Angle(V,X,W), which is asked in the question, but the problem gives us expressions for other angles. Let me focus on what we need: Find m∠VXW. 

Wait, the problem asks for the measure of angle at X between V and W, i.e., ∠VXW. Let me denote this as θ. 

We also have two other angles: ∠Z,X,V (which is at X between Z and V) and ∠Y,X,W (at X between Y and W). Their measures are 2x + 65 and 4x + 15, and their sum is 360. 

But earlier, we saw that if these angles are parts of the full 360 degrees around point X, then their sum being 360 suggests they are adjacent angles forming a full circle. However, around point X, there are four angles formed by two intersecting diameters. So, if ∠Z,X,V and ∠Y,X,W are two of those four angles, their sum could be 360 if they are opposite angles. Wait, but that would require each to be 180, which is not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not the ones formed by the diameters but are inscribed angles subtended by certain arcs. 

Let me think differently. Suppose that the angles ∠Z,X,V and ∠Y,X,W are not central angles but inscribed angles. But since X is the center, inscribed angles would require the vertex to be on the circumference. So that's not applicable. 

Wait, unless there's another point involved. For example, if there's a triangle XYZ, but the problem doesn't mention such points. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to the apparent contradiction in the given equations. However, since the problem provides the equations, I'll proceed with the algebra despite the geometric confusion. 

From the equations: 

MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) = 2x + 65  
MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)) = 4x + 15  
Their sum is 360. 

Solving: 2x + 65 + 4x + 15 = 360 → 6x + 80 = 360 → x = (360 - 80)/6 = 280/6 = 46.666... 

So x = 46.666..., which is 140/3. 

Now, the question is to find the measure of ∠VXW. Let's denote this as θ. 

How is θ related to the other angles? 

Since X is the center of the circle, and V and W are points on the circle, XV and XW are radii. The angle between them, ∠VXW, is a central angle, so its measure is equal to the measure of the arc VW. 

Also, the two diameters ZV and YW intersect at X. Let's consider the arrangement of these diameters. 

Assuming that ZV and YW are two diameters intersecting at X, forming four angles around X. Let's assume that the angle between ZV and YW is one of these angles. 

But how do the given angles fit into this? 

The given angles are ∠Z,X,V and ∠Y,X,W. Let's analyze their positions. 

∠Z,X,V is the angle at X between Z and V. Since Z and V are endpoints of a diameter, this angle is a straight angle (180 degrees), but according to the problem, it's 2x + 65. 

This suggests that the actual angle is not between Z and V, but perhaps between Z and another line. Wait, maybe the angle is formed by extending lines or involving other points. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle ∠Z,X,V is not the angle between Z and V but between Z and another line, like XY? But there's no mention of such a line. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved, such as triangle ZXY, where the angle at X is ∠Z,X,V. But without knowing where Y is, this is unclear. 

Given that I'm stuck on the geometric interpretation, I'll proceed with the algebraic results. 

From x = 46.666..., let's calculate the measures of the given angles: 

First angle: 2x + 65 = 2*(140/3) + 65 = 280/3 + 65 = 93.333... + 65 = 158.333... degrees. 

Second angle: 4x + 15 = 4*(140/3) + 15 = 560/3 + 15 = 186.666... + 15 = 201.666... degrees. 

Sum: 158.333 + 201.666 = 360 degrees. Correct. 

Now, what is ∠VXW? It's the angle at X between V and W. Since X is the center, and V and W are points on the circle, this is a central angle. 

To find its measure, we need to relate it to the other angles. Let's consider the full 360 degrees around point X. 

Assume that the two given angles (∠Z,X,V and ∠Y,X,W) are two of the four angles formed by the intersecting diameters. Their sum is 360, which suggests that they are adjacent and form a full rotation. Wait, but around a point, the sum of all angles is 360. So if two angles add up to 360, they must be adjacent and form a full circle, which would mean they are supplementary if they are adjacent and form a straight line. 

Wait, no— if two angles are adjacent and form a full rotation, their sum is 360. So, for example, if one angle is α and the next is β, and they are adjacent, then α + β = 360. But in reality, around a point, the sum of all angles is 360. So if two angles are adjacent and their sum is 360, that would mean they are the only two angles, which isn't the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the two given angles are opposite each other, each being 180 degrees. But as shown earlier, that doesn't align with the given expressions. 

However, if we consider that the two angles given are supplementary to the desired angle. 

Wait, let's think about the four angles around X. Let's denote them as follows: 

Let’s assume that the two given angles are two of the four angles formed by the intersecting diameters. Let’s say one angle is α = 2x + 65, another is β = 4x + 15, and the other two angles are γ and δ. 

Since the total is 360, we have α + β + γ + δ = 360. 

But if the problem states that α + β = 360, then γ + δ = 0, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the given angles are not both present in the sum of all angles around X. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not adjacent. For example, if α and β are opposite angles, then α = β, and their sum would be 2α. But since α + β = 360, then 2α = 360 → α = 180. But again, this doesn't align with the given expressions. 

At this point, I'm forced to consider that there might be a different relationship. Let's consider that the angle ∠VXW is the remaining angle. 

Assume that the sum of all four angles around X is 360. If two of them are given as α = 2x + 65 and β = 4x + 15, then the other two angles are γ and δ. But without knowing which angles are which, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠VXW is one of the given angles. Wait, no—the question asks for ∠VXW, which is a separate angle. 

Wait, maybe the angle ∠VXW is related to the other angles. For example, if the diameters ZV and YW intersect at X, then the angle between V and W would be determined by the positions of Y and Z. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Let me try to use the values of x to compute other angles. 

From above, x = 140/3 ≈ 46.666...

Now, let's consider that the two given angles are part of the full 360 degrees around X. Let's assume that the angle ∠Z,X,V (which is 2x + 65) and ∠Y,X,W (which is 4x + 15) are two of the four angles. Let's assume that the other two angles are equal to each other. 

Let’s denote the four angles as follows: 

α = 2x + 65  
β = 4x + 15  
γ = ?  
δ = ?

Since α + β + γ + δ = 360. 

If we assume that the other two angles are equal (because of symmetry), then γ = δ. 

So, α + β + 2γ = 360 → 2γ = 360 - (α + β) = 360 - 360 = 0 → γ = 0. Not possible. 

This suggests that the previous assumption is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe one of the other angles is the desired ∠VXW. Let's say ∠VXW is γ. Then, if α + β + γ + δ = 360, and we need to find γ. But without knowing δ, we can't determine γ. 

This indicates that without additional information about the relationship between the angles, it's impossible to determine ∠VXW. 

However, the problem must have a solution, so I must be missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not the ones at the center but at the circumference? Let me revisit this. 

If ∠Z,X,V is an inscribed angle, then its measure would be half the measure of the arc it subtends. But since X is the center, this would imply that the vertex is at the center, making it a central angle. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving X and other points. For example, if there's a triangle ZXY, with X being the center, and the angle at X is ∠Z,X,V. But this is unclear. 

Given that I'm stuck, let me return to the algebraic result and see if I can find ∠VXW in terms of x. 

Assuming that the angle ∠VXW is one of the angles around X, and the other angles are α = 2x + 65 and β = 4x + 15. Let's say the sum of all four angles is 360. 

Let’s assume that ∠VXW is one of the other angles, say γ. Then, if α + β + γ + δ = 360. But without knowing δ, I can't solve for γ. 

Unless there's a relationship between the angles. For example, if the two given angles are vertical angles, then they are equal. But according to the given expressions, 2x + 65 = 4x + 15 → 2x + 65 = 4x + 15 → 65 - 15 = 2x → 50 = 2x → x = 25. 

Wait, this is a new approach. If the two given angles are vertical angles, then they are equal. So setting their expressions equal: 2x + 65 = 4x + 15 → 65 - 15 = 4x - 2x → 50 = 2x → x = 25. 

This would make sense if the angles are vertical angles. Let's test this. 

If x = 25, then:  
Measure of ∠Z,X,V = 2*25 + 65 = 50 + 65 = 115 degrees.  
Measure of ∠Y,X,W = 4*25 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 degrees. 

So both angles are 115 degrees. If they are vertical angles, then their sum would be 115 + 115 = 230 degrees, but the problem states that their sum is 360. This doesn't align. 

Wait, but if these two angles are not vertical angles but supplementary. For example, if they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair, their sum would be 180. But the problem says their sum is 360, which is double that. 

Alternatively, if the two angles are adjacent and their sum is 360, that would mean they are overlapping, which isn't possible. 

But wait, if the two angles are adjacent and form a full circle, then their sum is 360. This would mean that they are adjacent and their non-overlapping parts make up the full circle. 

In this case, if ∠Z,X,V and ∠Y,X,W are adjacent angles around point X, their sum would be 360. Let's assume that. 

With x = 25, as found earlier, the sum is 115 + 115 = 230, which is not 360. So this doesn't work. 

But if we set their sum to 360, we had x = 46.666... as before. 

Now, let's consider that the angle ∠VXW is the remaining angle. Assuming that the two given angles are adjacent and their sum is 360, then the other two angles would be zero, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the problem setup or my interpretation. 

Given the time I've spent without resolving the geometric interpretation, I'll proceed with the algebraic solution and assume that the angle ∠VXW is related to the other angles through the total 360 degrees around point X. 

Assume that the four angles around X are:  
α = 2x + 65  
β = 4x + 15  
γ = ∠VXW (what we need to find)  
δ = ? 

Since α + β + γ + δ = 360. 

But without knowing δ, I cannot find γ. 

Wait, perhaps δ is equal to one of the given angles? If the two diameters are symmetric, maybe δ is equal to α or β. 

For example, if the two diameters are perpendicular, then the angles would be 90 degrees, but that's not our case. 

Alternatively, if the two given angles are α and β, and the other two angles are equal to each other. Let's say γ = δ. Then:  
α + β + 2γ = 360 → 2γ = 360 - (α + β) = 360 - 360 = 0 → γ = 0. Impossible. 

This suggests that the only way this works is if α + β = 360, and γ = δ = 0, which is not possible. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that the given angles are not both present in the sum of the angles around X. 

Maybe the angle ∠Z,X,V is one angle, and the angle ∠Y,X,W is another, and the angle ∠VXW is a third. Let's say:  
α = 2x + 65  
β = 4x + 15  
γ = ∠VXW  
And the fourth angle is δ. 

But again, without knowing δ, we can't solve. 

Wait, but perhaps the angle ∠VXW is the supplement of one of the given angles? For example, if the two given angles are adjacent to ∠VXW. 

Alternatively, if the angle ∠VXW is part of the total 360, along with the other angles. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've invested, I'll proceed with the algebraic result and assume that the angle ∠VXW is the difference between 360 and the sum of the given angles. Wait, but their sum is already 360. 

Wait, the problem states that the sum of MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) and MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)) is 360. So, if those two angles are part of the full 360 around X, then the remaining angles would be zero, which is not possible. 

This suggests that the given angles are not around X, but elsewhere. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not at X but at other points. For example, if ∠Z,X,V is an angle at X, but it's not part of the circle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not central angles but inscribed angles. Let's try this. 

If ∠Z,X,V is an inscribed angle, then its measure is half the measure of the arc it subtends. But since X is the center, this would require that the vertex is on the circumference, which it isn't. So this is invalid. 

Finally, I'll consider that the given angles are not at X, but at other points. For example, if ∠Z,X,V is an angle at X, but it's formed by lines that are not diameters. 

But the problem states that Line(Z,V) is a diameter, so it passes through X. So, the angle at X between Z and V would still be a straight angle. 

Given that I'm unable to resolve the geometric interpretation, I'll proceed with the algebraic solution and assume that the angle ∠VXW is the remaining angle in the total 360 degrees. 

If the sum of the two given angles is 360, then there are no other angles, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the problem has a different configuration. 

Wait, the problem also mentions Angle(V,X,W), which is the angle we need to find. Let's denote this as θ. 

If we assume that the two given angles and θ are part of the total 360, then:  
(2x + 65) + (4x + 15) + θ = 360 → 6x + 80 + θ = 360 → θ = 280 - 6x. 

But we also have from the given equations: 6x + 80 = 360 → x = 280/6 = 46.666... 

Substituting back: θ = 280 - 6*(280/6) = 280 - 280 = 0. Which is impossible. 

This suggests that the assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle θ is part of the sum with one of the given angles. For example, if θ + (2x + 65) = 360, then θ = 360 - (2x + 65). But without knowing which angle it is paired with, this is speculative. 

Given that I'm running out of options, I'll refer back to the original equations and see if there's a way to express θ. 

From the given, we have x = 280/6 = 140/3. 

Now, let's think about the angle ∠VXW. Since X is the center, and V and W are points on the circle, this angle is a central angle. Its measure is equal to the measure of the arc VW. 

Now, the arc VW can be determined by the other arcs. Since ZV and YW are diameters, the arc ZV is 180 degrees, as is arc YW. 

But how does arc VW relate to the other arcs? 

Assuming that the points are arranged such that moving from Z to V to W to Y to Z around the circle. 

But without a diagram, it's hard to know. 

Alternatively, the measure of arc VW can be calculated as the difference between arcs ZW and ZV or something similar. 

Alternatively, if we consider the angles at X: the angle between ZV and YW. 

Wait, if we consider the angle between ZV and YW at X, it would be the angle between the two diameters. Let's say that angle is θ, which is ∠VXW. 

Wait, if the two diameters ZV and YW intersect at X, then the angle between them is ∠VXW. 

If that's the case, then the measure of ∠VXW is equal to the angle between the two diameters. 

Now, the sum of the other angles around X would be the other angles. 

For example, if the angle between ZV and YW is θ, then the opposite angle is also θ, and the other two angles are supplementary to θ. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

The given angles are ∠Z,X,V (which is a straight angle, 180 degrees) and ∠Y,X,W (also a straight angle, 180 degrees). But this contradicts the given expressions. 

Alternatively, if the given angles are not straight angles but other angles formed by the intersection of lines. 

Wait, perhaps the angle ∠Z,X,V is not the straight angle but another angle formed by extending lines. For example, if there's a triangle ZXY, and the angle at X is ∠Z,X,V. 

But without more information, this is too vague. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the intended solution is to solve for x using the given equations, then find θ = 280 - 6x. 

Wait, earlier calculation showed that θ = 280 - 6x, but with x = 140/3, this gives θ = 0, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if the angle ∠VXW is the supplement of one of the given angles. 

For example, if θ = 180 - (2x + 65) or something like that. 

But without a clear relation, this is guesswork. 

Given the answer choices are A. 25, B. 65, C. 115, D. 180. 

If we take x = 25, as previously, leading to ∠Z,X,V = 115 and ∠Y,X,W = 115. If these are two angles at X, and the other two angles are 180 - 115 = 65 each, then the sum would be 115 + 115 + 65 + 65 = 360. In this case, the angle ∠VXW could be one of the 65-degree angles, which would be choice B. 

But how does this connect to the given equations? 

If x = 25, then the sum of the given angles is 115 + 115 = 230, and the other two angles are 65 each, totaling 230 + 65 + 65 = 360. 

But how does this relate to ∠VXW? If ∠VXW is one of the 65-degree angles, then the answer is B. 

Alternatively, if the angle ∠VXW is the supplement of one of the given angles, like 180 - 115 = 65, which is choice B. 

This seems plausible. 

So, even though the initial equations led to x = 46.666, but if we assume that the given angles are not the ones forming the full 360, but part of it, and that x = 25, leading to ∠VXW = 65, which is choice B. 

But why would x = 25? Because if the two given angles are equal (vertical angles), then x = 25. 

Even though this doesn't satisfy the sum of 360, it's possible that the problem intended for the angles to be vertical angles, and the sum of 360 was a mistake, or there's a different interpretation. 

Given the answer choices, and if we assume x = 25, then the measure of ∠VXW could be 65, which is choice B. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the sum of the two given angles is 360, leading to x = 46.666, and then the angle ∠VXW is 360 - (sum of the two given angles) = 0, which is impossible. 

But given the answer choices, and the possibility that the correct approach is to set the two given angles equal (as vertical angles), leading to x=25, and then ∠VXW = 65, which is choice B. 

Therefore, I'll choose B as the answer.
