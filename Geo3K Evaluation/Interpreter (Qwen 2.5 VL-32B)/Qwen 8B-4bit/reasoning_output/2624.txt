MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two angles, angle 9 and angle 10, with measures given as 2x - 4 and 2x + 4 respectively. The question asks for the measure of angle 10. The answer choices are A. 86, B. 94, C. 98, D. 104. 

First, I need to recall the given predicates. There's a LinearPair relationship between angle 9 and angle 10, which means they are supplementary. That implies their measures add up to 180 degrees. Also, there are equations given: the sum of their measures equals 180, and each angle's measure is expressed in terms of x. 

So, starting with the Linear Pair. Since they form a linear pair, they should be adjacent and supplementary. Therefore, m∠9 + m∠10 = 180°. According to the problem, m∠9 is 2x - 4 and m∠10 is 2x + 4. Let me write that equation out:

(2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180

Simplifying this, combine like terms. The -4 and +4 cancel each other out, so it becomes 4x = 180. Then, dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 45. 

Once I find x, I can substitute back into the expression for m∠10. So, substituting x = 45 into 2x + 4:

2*(45) + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94. 

Looking at the answer choices, 94 corresponds to option B. Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I handle the equations correctly? The sum of the two expressions was indeed 4x, leading to x=45. Then calculating angle 10: 2*45=90 plus 4 is 94. Yes, that seems right. 

But wait, maybe there's something about the diagram that affects this? The problem mentions points A, B, C, D, E with various lines connecting them. For instance, Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(C,E), Line(B,D), Line(B,E). And there are angles mentioned at point B, C, E and C, D. But since the problem already states that the angles are part of a linear pair, perhaps the diagram is just there to indicate that those angles are supplementary. 

Another check: if x=45, then angle 9 would be 2*45 -4 = 90-4=86, and angle 10 is 94. Adding them gives 86+94=180, which fits the supplementary condition. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the measure of angle 10 is 94, which is answer B.
