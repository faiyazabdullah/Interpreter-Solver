Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ, and there's a point A connected to all four corners. The given information includes several predicates about lines, right angles, congruence, and some angle measures. The question asks for the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

- Rectangle(W,X,Y,Z): So W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. That means all angles are right angles (90 degrees each) and opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Points W, X, Y, Z, A are all points.
- Lines: W-X, X-Y, Y-Z, Z-W, W-Z, X-Y (wait, maybe some duplicates here?), but also lines W-A, X-A, Y-A, Z-A. So point A is connected to all four corners of the rectangle.
- Right angles at each corner: Angle(W,X,Y), Angle(X,Y,Z), etc., are all right angles.
- Measure of Angle(1) is 30 degrees. Wait, angle 1? But where is angle 1 located? Maybe it refers to one of the angles formed at point A?
- Also, there are congruences: Line(W,A) is congruent to Line(A,Z), and Line(X,A) is congruent to Line(A,Y). So the segments from A to W and A to Z are equal, same with A to X and A to Y.
- Parallel lines: Line(W,X) is parallel to Line(Y,Z), and Line(W,Z) is parallel to Line(X,Y). Which makes sense since it's a rectangle.

Now, the main goal is to find the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Since the answer choices are A-D, and angle 1 is 30, maybe angle 6 is another angle in the diagram involving point A?

Let me visualize the rectangle WXYZ with point A inside or outside? The lines from A to each vertex suggest that A is connected to all four vertices. Given that WA ≅ AZ and XA ≅ AY, perhaps A is the center of the rectangle? Because in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so the intersection point of the diagonals would be the midpoint. However, here the connections are from A to each vertex, not just the diagonals. Wait, but if WA ≅ AZ and XA ≅ AY, that suggests that A is equidistant from W and Z, and from X and Y. So maybe A is the center? Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, so the center would be the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, if A is the center, then WA and AZ would be half-diagonals, hence congruent. Similarly for XA and AY.

So assuming A is the center of the rectangle. Then connecting A to all four vertices creates four segments from the center to the corners. Now, considering the angles mentioned. The problem mentions angle 1 is 30 degrees. Since angles are labeled as 1, maybe they refer to angles formed at point A? For example, angle WAX, or something like that.

Wait, the problem says "MeasureOf(Angle(1))" equals 30. But how is angle 1 defined? In standard notation, angles are usually denoted by three points, like ∠WXA or something. But here, the angle 1 could be referring to one of the angles formed at point A. Let me think.

Since A is connected to all four corners, there are four angles at point A: between WA and XA, XA and YA, YA and ZA, ZA and WA. These angles would sum up to 360 degrees. If angle 1 is one of these, say between WA and XA, and if that's 30 degrees, then maybe others can be found based on symmetry or other properties.

But wait, the problem states that angle 1 is 30 degrees. But without knowing which angle it is, it's hard to proceed. However, looking back at the given predicates, there's a mention of "MeasureOf(Angle(1))", which probably corresponds to one of the angles formed at A. Let me check the rest of the predicates.

Also, there are other angle measures given: the right angles at each corner of the rectangle are 90 degrees. And the measure of angle(W,X,Y) is 90, which is consistent with the rectangle.

But how does angle 1 relate to the rest? Let's assume that angle 1 is one of the angles formed at point A. Suppose angle 1 is ∠WAX. Then, if we can find relations between those angles, perhaps using triangle properties or congruence.

Given that WA ≅ AZ and XA ≅ AY, and since WXYZ is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So, the distance from A to W is equal to the distance from A to Z, because A is the midpoint. Similarly for XA and AY. So, if we consider triangles formed by A and two adjacent vertices, like triangle WAX and triangle XAY, etc.

Alternatively, since A is the center, the lines from A to the vertices divide the rectangle into four triangles. Each triangle would have two sides that are halves of the diagonals. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if A is the center, then WA = AZ and XA = AY. Moreover, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length, so WA = XA? No, that's not necessarily true unless it's a square. Wait, in a general rectangle, the diagonals are equal, but their halves would be equal. So, WA = AZ = (diagonal)/2, and similarly XA = AY = (diagonal)/2. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, so WA = AZ and XA = AY, but WA may not be equal to XA unless it's a square.

Therefore, the distances from A to the vertices are equal? No, unless it's a square. So, in a non-square rectangle, the distances from A to the vertices would vary. Wait, no—since A is the midpoint of the diagonals, WA and AZ are both half-diagonals, so WA = AZ. Similarly, XA = AY. But WA and XA depend on the side lengths of the rectangle. So, if the rectangle is not a square, then WA ≠ XA.

However, in our case, we have that Line(W,A) is congruent to Line(A,Z), which is already covered by being midpoints. Similarly, Line(X,A) is congruent to Line(A,Y). So, that's just confirming that A is the midpoint of the diagonals, which is inherent in a rectangle.

Now, considering the angles at point A. Let me imagine point A inside the rectangle. Connecting A to all four vertices divides the rectangle into four triangles. Each triangle has two sides that are halves of the diagonals and one side that's a side of the rectangle. Wait, no. Each triangle would be formed by two adjacent vertices and A. For example, triangle WAX has sides WA, AX, and WX. But since WA and AZ are parts of the diagonal, and AX is part of another diagonal?

Wait, perhaps I should consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place the rectangle WXYZ on a coordinate system. Let’s suppose W is at (0,0), X is at (a,0), Y is at (a,b), Z is at (0,b). Then, the center A would be at ((a/2), (b/2)). 

Then, point A is the midpoint of the diagonals. So, lines WA, XA, YA, ZA connect A to each corner. Now, let's compute vectors or slopes to find angles at A.

For example, vector AW goes from A to W: from (a/2, b/2) to (0,0), so direction (-a/2, -b/2). Vector AX goes from A to X: (a - a/2, 0 - b/2) = (a/2, -b/2). Similarly, vector AY is (a/2, b/2), and AZ is (-a/2, b/2).

Now, the angle between two lines at point A can be found using the dot product formula. For instance, angle between WA and XA would be between vectors AW and AX. Wait, but actually, the angle at A between WA and XA would be between vectors AW and AX. Wait, but vectors from A to W and from A to X. So vectors AW and AX. Wait, the angle between vectors AW and AX is the angle at point A between lines WA and XA.

So, using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AW · AX) / (|AW| |AX|)

Compute AW · AX: (-a/2)(a/2) + (-b/2)(-b/2) = (-a²/4 + b²/4)

|AW| = sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 ) = (sqrt(a² + b²))/2

Similarly, |AX| is the same as |AW|. Therefore,

cos(theta) = [(-a² + b²)/4] / [(a² + b²)/4)] = (b² - a²)/(a² + b²)

So theta = arccos( (b² - a²)/(a² + b²) )

Hmm, interesting. This depends on the ratio of a and b. Now, if angle 1 is this angle theta, then its measure is determined by the aspect ratio of the rectangle.

But we know that angle 1 is 30 degrees. So:

arccos( (b² - a²)/(a² + b²) ) = 30°

Taking cosine of both sides:

(b² - a²)/(a² + b²) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2

Let me write that equation:

(b² - a²) / (a² + b²) = √3 / 2

Cross-multiplying:

2(b² - a²) = √3 (a² + b²)

Expanding:

2b² - 2a² = √3 a² + √3 b²

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

2b² - 2a² - √3 a² - √3 b² = 0

Factor terms:

(2 - √3)b² - (2 + √3)a² = 0

Rearranged:

(2 - √3)b² = (2 + √3)a²

Divide both sides by a²:

(2 - √3)(b/a)² = 2 + √3

Let me denote k = b/a, so:

(2 - √3)k² = 2 + √3

Thus,

k² = (2 + √3) / (2 - √3)

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √3):

Numerator becomes (2 + √3)^2

Denominator becomes (2)^2 - (√3)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1

So k² = (4 + 4√3 + 3)/1 = 7 + 4√3

Therefore, k = sqrt(7 + 4√3)

Wait, but sqrt(7 + 4√3) can be simplified. Let me see: suppose sqrt(7 + 4√3) is equal to sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Let's square both sides:

a + b + 2√(ab) = 7 + 4√3

Comparing, we get:

a + b = 7

and 2√(ab) = 4√3 → √(ab) = 2√3 → ab = 12

So solving a + b = 7 and ab=12. The solutions are roots of x^2 -7x +12=0 → x=(7±√(49-48))/2 = (7±1)/2 → x=4 or x=3. Thus, sqrt(7+4√3)=sqrt(4)+sqrt(3)=2+√3. Check:

(2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3. Yes! Correct.

So k = 2 + √3. Therefore, b/a = 2 + √3. Hence, the ratio of the sides of the rectangle is b/a = 2 + √3. 

This implies that the rectangle is very "stretched" vertically compared to horizontally, since 2 + √3 is approximately 3.732.

Now, returning to the problem. We need to find the measure of angle 6. But what is angle 6? The problem mentions "angle 1" is 30 degrees, so likely angle 6 is another angle in the diagram. Since the options are 30, 45, 60, 90, and angle 1 is 30, perhaps angle 6 is supplementary or complementary to angle 1, or relates via triangle properties.

Assuming that angle 1 is the angle between WA and XA, which we've computed as 30 degrees. Then, perhaps angle 6 is another angle formed at point A. Since there are four angles around point A, and they sum to 360 degrees. If angle 1 is 30 degrees, then depending on the configuration, other angles may be determined.

In the earlier calculation, we found that the angle between WA and XA is 30 degrees. What about the angle between XA and YA? Let's compute that. Using similar methods.

Vector AX is (a/2, -b/2), and vector AY is (a/2, b/2). The angle between AX and AY can be found using the dot product.

Dot product of AX and AY: (a/2)(a/2) + (-b/2)(b/2) = a²/4 - b²/4

Magnitude of AX and AY are the same as before, sqrt(a² + b²)/2.

So cos(theta) = (a² - b²)/ (a² + b²)

Which is negative of previous case. Therefore, theta = arccos( (a² - b²)/(a² + b²) ). 

We had earlier that b² - a² = √3/(something). Wait, from earlier:

From the first equation, we had (b² - a²)/(a² + b²) = √3/2. So (a² - b²)/(a² + b²) = -√3/2. Therefore, the angle between AX and AY would be arccos(-√3/2), which is 150 degrees, since cos(150°) = -√3/2.

So, angle between AX and AY is 150 degrees. Similarly, the other angles at point A would be symmetric. Let me verify:

Around point A, there are four angles. Assuming the rectangle is oriented with horizontal and vertical sides, the angles at A would alternate between two different measures. For example, if angle between WA and XA is 30 degrees, then the opposite angle (between ZA and Y?) would also be 30 degrees. While the other two angles would be 150 degrees each. Because total around point A is 360 degrees.

So, 30 + 150 + 30 + 150 = 360. That adds up. So if angle 1 is one of the 30-degree angles, then the other angles are 150, 30, 150. So, depending on which angle is referred to as angle 6.

But the problem mentions "angle 6". How many angles are there? Well, there are four angles at point A. If angle 1 is one of them, then angle 6 could be another. But without more info, maybe angle 6 is one of the larger ones, like 150 degrees. But none of the answer choices include 150. Wait, the answer choices are 30, 45, 60, 90. Hmm. So maybe my assumption about angle 1 isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 refers to a different angle. Let me reconsider. The problem says "MeasureOf(Angle(1))", but angle labels aren't specified. Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles of the rectangle? But all angles of the rectangle are 90 degrees. Or maybe angle 1 is an angle formed by intersecting lines at point A, but not the ones between the segments from A to the vertices. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle formed by A and two adjacent vertices?

Wait, for example, triangle WAX. In that triangle, we have sides WA, AX, and WX. Since WA and AX are both half-diagonals, but WX is a side of the rectangle. Let's calculate angles in this triangle.

Earlier, we saw that angle at A between WA and AX is 30 degrees (assuming that's angle 1). Then, in triangle WAX, the angles would be 30 degrees at A, and the other two angles at W and X. Let's compute those.

Using the Law of Sines for triangle WAX:

sin(angle at W)/AX = sin(angle at A)/WX

But maybe better to use coordinates. Let me take specific values for a and b to simplify. Since we found that b/a = 2 + √3, let's choose a=1, then b=2 + √3. Let me compute coordinates:

W(0,0), X(1,0), Y(1, 2 + √3), Z(0, 2 + √3). Point A is at (0.5, (2 + √3)/2).

Now, compute the lengths:

WA is the distance from A to W: sqrt( (0.5)^2 + ((2 + √3)/2)^2 )

Similarly, AX is the distance from A to X: sqrt( (0.5)^2 + ((2 + √3)/2)^2 ), same as WA. So WA = AX.

WX is the distance from W to X: 1 unit.

So triangle WAX has two sides of length sqrt(0.25 + ((2 + √3)^2)/4) and base 1. Let me compute that.

First, compute (2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3. Divided by 4 gives (7 + 4√3)/4. Adding 0.25 (which is 1/4) gives (7 + 4√3)/4 + 1/4 = (8 + 4√3)/4 = 2 + √3. So WA = sqrt(2 + √3).

So triangle WAX has sides WA = AX = sqrt(2 + √3), and WX = 1.

Now, applying the Law of Cosines to find the angles. Let's find angle at A, which we already know is 30 degrees. Let me confirm with Law of Cosines:

WX² = WA² + AX² - 2*WA*AX*cos(angle at A)

Plugging numbers:

1² = (2 + √3) + (2 + √3) - 2*(sqrt(2 + √3))^2 * cos(30°)

Wait, sqrt(2 + √3) squared is 2 + √3. So:

Left side: 1

Right side: 2*(2 + √3) - 2*(2 + √3)*cos(30°)

Factor out 2*(2 + √3):

Right side = 2*(2 + √3)*(1 - cos(30°))

Calculate cos(30°) = √3/2. So:

Right side = 2*(2 + √3)*(1 - √3/2) 

Let me compute this:

First compute (1 - √3/2) = (2 - √3)/2

Multiply by 2*(2 + √3):

2*(2 + √3)*(2 - √3)/2 = (2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 4 - 3 = 1

Yes, which matches the left side. So the calculation checks out.

Now, what about the other angles in triangle WAX? Let's compute angle at W. Using Law of Sines:

sin(angle at W)/AX = sin(angle at A)/WX

So sin(angle at W) = [AX / WX] * sin(angle at A)

AX = sqrt(2 + √3), WX = 1, angle at A = 30°.

So sin(angle at W) = sqrt(2 + √3) * sin(30°) = sqrt(2 + √3) * 0.5

What is sqrt(2 + √3)? Earlier, we saw that it's equal to 2 + √3? No, wait. Earlier we found that sqrt(7 + 4√3) was 2 + √3, but sqrt(2 + √3) is a different value. Let me compute sqrt(2 + √3):

Note that sqrt(2 + √3) can be expressed as sqrt[(sqrt(3)/2 + 1/2)*2], but maybe it's better to rationalize. Alternatively, note that sqrt(2 + √3) = 2cos(15°), since cos(15°) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4, so 2cos(15°) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 1.931. Let me check numerically:

sqrt(2 + √3) ≈ sqrt(2 + 1.732) ≈ sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931.

And 2cos(15°) ≈ 2 * 0.9659 ≈ 1.931. Correct. So sqrt(2 + √3) = 2cos(15°).

Thus, sin(angle at W) = 2cos(15°) * 0.5 = cos(15°).

So angle at W is arcsin(cos(15°)) = arcsin(sin(75°)) = 75°, since cos(15°) = sin(75°).

Therefore, angle at W is 75 degrees. Similarly, angle at X is also 75 degrees, since triangle is isoceles.

So in triangle WAX, angles are 30°, 75°, 75°.

Now, if angle 1 is 30°, and angle 6 is another angle... but what is angle 6 referring to? If angle 6 is one of the angles in triangle WAX, then it could be 75°, which isn't among the answer choices. Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to another angle in the diagram.

Wait, the problem statement lists "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of angle 6 if m∠1 = 30." So angle 6 might be referring to an angle formed by other lines. Perhaps angle 6 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of lines from A to the rectangle's vertices and other lines?

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to an angle in another triangle. For example, triangle XAY, which would be similar to triangle WAX. Or maybe an angle formed by extending certain lines?

Alternatively, perhaps angle 6 is an external angle or something else. Let me think again about the entire figure.

Given that A is connected to all four vertices, forming four triangles. The angles at A are 30°, 150°, 30°, 150°, as previously deduced. So if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 6 could be one of the 150° angles, but 150 isn't in the choices. So that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to an angle in the rectangle itself. But all rectangle angles are 90°, so that's not helpful.

Another possibility: the problem mentions "angle 1" and "angle 6"—maybe they are numbered sequentially in the diagram. For example, if the diagram has angles labeled 1 through 6, and angle 1 is 30°, then angle 6 could be another specific angle.

Without seeing the actual diagram, it's challenging, but maybe angle 6 refers to an angle formed by two lines that are not at point A. For example, maybe angle between lines WA and ZA? Wait, but those are two diagonals meeting at A, forming an angle of either 30° or 150°, depending on which pair.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to an angle formed by lines from A to other points. For example, if there's a line from A to somewhere else, creating new angles. But the given predicates don't mention such lines beyond the ones connecting A to the rectangle's vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to angles in triangles formed by other intersections. For example, if lines from A to the vertices intersect with other lines, creating new angles. But given the information provided, I don't see such intersections mentioned.

Wait, another thought: the problem mentions "Line(W,A)", "Line(X,A)", etc., which are the lines from A to each vertex. These lines could form various angles with the sides of the rectangle. For example, the angle between WA and WX, which is angle at W between WA and WX. In triangle WAX, we found that angle at W is 75°, which could be angle 6.

But why would angle 6 be that? It's unclear without the diagram. However, given the answer choices, 75° isn't present, but 60° is. Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to an angle formed by two adjacent triangles' angles.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 6 is the supplement of angle 1. If angle 1 is 30°, then its supplement is 150°, which again isn't in the choices. Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is the complement of angle 1, which would be 60°, which is one of the answer choices. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, considering the earlier calculation where angle between WA and XA is 30°, and if angle 6 is the angle between XA and YA, which was 150°, but that's not in choices. Alternatively, perhaps angle 6 is the angle between WA and ZA, which would be 180° minus the angle between WA and XA plus angle between XA and ZA? Not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial problem: the user mentioned that the answer choices are 30, 45, 60, 90. Given that angle 1 is 30, and the presence of a rectangle, which has right angles, maybe angle 6 is related to the 30° angle through some geometric relationship.

Let me think differently. Since A is connected to all four vertices, and WA ≅ AZ, XA ≅ AY. So, if I look at triangles WAX and ZAY, they might be congruent or similar. But since WA ≅ AZ, XA ≅ AY, and angle at A is 30°, then triangles WAX and ZAY are congruent. Similarly, triangles XAY and WAZ might have some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps there are triangles formed by connecting A to the sides of the rectangle, creating smaller triangles with known angles.

Wait, another idea: since the rectangle's sides are perpendicular, and we've got certain angles at point A, perhaps there are right triangles involved. For example, if we drop perpendiculars from A to the sides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's revisit the earlier calculation where angle between WA and XA is 30°, leading to the ratio b/a = 2 + √3. With that ratio, the other angles in the rectangle can be analyzed.

For example, the sides of the rectangle are a and b, with b = (2 + √3)a. Let me compute tan(theta), where theta is the angle of the rectangle's side with respect to the horizontal. Since the rectangle's sides are horizontal and vertical, but the slope of the diagonal is b/a = 2 + √3. The angle phi between the diagonal and the horizontal axis is arctan(b/a) = arctan(2 + √3). What is arctan(2 + √3)?

Well, tan(75°) = 2 + √3. Because tan(45° + 30°) = (tan45 + tan30)/(1 - tan45 tan30) = (1 + 1/√3)/(1 - 1*1/√3) = multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (√3 + 1)/(√3 - 1) multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1): [(√3 + 1)^2]/[3 - 1] = (3 + 2√3 + 1)/2 = (4 + 2√3)/2 = 2 + √3. Yes! So arctan(2 + √3) is 75°, so the angle between the diagonal and the horizontal is 75°.

Now, considering the diagonals of the rectangle. Each diagonal makes an angle of 75° with the horizontal. So, the angle between the diagonal WZ and the horizontal is 75°, and the angle between the diagonal XZ and the horizontal is 180° - 75° = 105°, or something like that. Wait, perhaps not directly helpful.

Alternatively, considering the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, the diagonal WZ splits the rectangle into two triangles. But how does that relate to point A?

Alternatively, think about the fact that the angle between the diagonals in a rectangle is determined by the rectangle's aspect ratio. In a rectangle, the angle between the diagonals is 2θ, where θ is the angle between a diagonal and a side. For example, if the diagonals intersect at A, then the angle between the diagonals would be 2 times the angle between a diagonal and a side. Since the diagonals bisect each other, they form an 'X' shape, and the angle between them depends on the rectangle's sides.

In our case, since the angle between the diagonal and the horizontal is 75°, then the angle between the two diagonals would be 2*(75° - 45°)? Wait, no. Let me think. The diagonals cross at A, forming vertical angles. The angle between the two diagonals would be twice the angle between a diagonal and the horizontal. Wait, if one diagonal makes 75° with the horizontal, then the other diagonal (from X to Z) would make an angle of 180° - 75° = 105° with the positive x-axis. The angle between the two diagonals would be the difference between 105° and 75°, which is 30°. Wait, that's interesting. So the angle between the two diagonals is 30°, which is angle 1!

Ah! So angle between the diagonals WZ and XZ is 30°, which is angle 1. Therefore, angle 1 refers to the angle between the two diagonals of the rectangle, which is 30°, and we're asked to find angle 6. If angle 6 is another angle related to this setup.

But what is angle 6? If angle 1 is the angle between the diagonals (30°), then angle 6 might be the other angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other but are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. The angle between the diagonals is 30°, so the other angle formed by the intersection is 180° - 30° = 150°. But again, 150 isn't in the choices.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals with the sides. For example, in triangle formed by diagonal WZ and side WX. Or perhaps angle 6 is one of the angles in the triangles created by the diagonals.

Wait, let's consider the diagonals intersecting at A. They form two angles of 30° and 150°. If angle 1 is the 30°, then angle 6 could be the supplementary angle, 150°, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe angle 6 refers to an angle in one of the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides.

Take triangle WAZ. It's formed by points W, A, Z. Since WA and AZ are halves of the diagonal, and WZ is the full diagonal. In this triangle, the angle at A is 30°, and the other two angles at W and Z would be equal, since it's an isosceles triangle (WA = AZ). So, angles at W and Z would be (180° - 30°)/2 = 75° each.

If angle 6 is one of these 75° angles, but 75° isn't in the choices. However, the closest answer is 60°, which is option C. But how to arrive at 60°?

Wait, maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me think about the given congruences: Line(W,A) ≅ Line(A,Z) and Line(X,A) ≅ Line(A,Y). This confirms that A is the midpoint of the diagonals, as expected in a rectangle. But if we consider triangles formed by connecting A to other points, like triangle WAX and triangle XYZ?

Wait, perhaps there's a way to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangle where angle 6 appears. Let me consider triangle XAY. Earlier, we found that in triangle WAX, the angles were 30°, 75°, 75°. Similarly, in triangle XAY, since XA = AY, it would also have angles of 30°, 75°, 75°, assuming the same configuration. But again, 75° isn't an option.

Wait, maybe angle 6 is referring to an angle in a different triangle. For example, if we draw a line from A to the midpoint of a side, but that's not mentioned in the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves other points or lines not explicitly mentioned.

Wait, the problem mentions "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of angle 6 if m∠1 = 30." Maybe angle 6 is referring to an angle formed by the intersection of lines from A to other points, such as the intersection of lines WA and XA with some other lines. But without more information, it's difficult to tell.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is referring to an angle formed by the diagonals and a side. For example, in triangle WAX, we found that angle at W is 75°, which is the angle between WA and WX. If angle 6 is this angle, then it's 75°, which isn't in the choices. But perhaps there's another angle.

Wait, let's consider that in the rectangle, the diagonals divide it into four triangles, and each of these triangles has angles that could be related. For example, in triangle WAX, we have angles 30°, 75°, 75°. In triangle XAY, similar. The angle at A between XA and YA is 150°, as calculated earlier. So if angle 6 is one of these 150° angles, but again, not in the choices.

At this point, I'm stuck trying to map angle 6 to a specific angle. Given that the answer choices are 30, 45, 60, 90, and angle 1 is 30°, perhaps angle 6 is 60°, and there's a way to derive that.

Let me recall that in a rectangle with diagonals intersecting at 30°, the other angles between the diagonals are 150°, but if we consider the angles formed with the sides, maybe there's a way to find 60°.

Wait, earlier, we found that the angle between the diagonal and the horizontal is 75°, which is the angle between the diagonal and the side WX. If we consider the angle between the diagonal and the vertical side, it would be 90° - 75° = 15°. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if we consider the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides, like triangle WAX, where angle at W is 75°, and if there's a way to split that angle into smaller angles. For example, if there's a line from A to the midpoint of WX, but that's not mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves constructing an equilateral triangle or something, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another idea: since the angle between the diagonals is 30°, and the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, maybe there's an equilateral triangle involved. For example, if the angle between the diagonals is 30°, and if the triangle formed by the diagonals and a side is somehow related. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the fact that in the rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, and the angle between them is 30°. So, the diagonals form a rhombus (since they bisect each other), but in this case, it's a rectangle, so the figure formed by the diagonals is a rhombus with angles 30° and 150°. In such a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular if and only if it's a square. Here, since the angle is 30°, it's not a square.

In a rhombus, the area can be calculated as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the diagonals. Also, the area can be calculated as base * height, or as the product of the diagonals times sine of the angle between them divided by 2. Wait, yes: Area = (d1 * d2 * sin(theta))/2, where theta is the angle between the diagonals. But since the area of the rectangle is also a*b, where a and b are the sides.

But earlier, we found that b/a = 2 + √3. Let me denote a = 1, then b = 2 + √3. So area of rectangle is a*b = 1*(2 + √3) = 2 + √3.

On the other hand, the area of the rhombus formed by the diagonals is (d1*d2*sin(theta))/2. In this case, the diagonals of the rectangle are equal in length, since it's a rectangle. Wait, no—the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, so d1 = d2 = sqrt(a² + b²). So substituting, the area would be (d1^2 * sin(theta))/2. But this equals (a² + b²) * sin(theta)/2.

But we also know the area is a*b. So:

a*b = (a² + b²) * sin(theta)/2

Substituting a=1, b=2 + √3, theta=30°, let's check:

Left side: 1*(2 + √3) = 2 + √3 ≈ 3.732

Right side: (1 + (2 + √3)^2) * sin(30°)/2

Calculate (2 + √3)^2 = 7 + 4√3, so a² + b² = 1 + 7 + 4√3 = 8 + 4√3

Multiply by sin(30°) = 0.5: (8 + 4√3) * 0.5 = 4 + 2√3

Divide by 2: (4 + 2√3)/2 = 2 + √3, which matches the left side. So this checks out.

But how does this help us? Maybe it doesn't directly. 

Back to the original problem. If angle 1 is 30°, and we need to find angle 6, which might be an angle in a different context. Given that I'm running out of ideas, and the answer choices include 60°, maybe angle 6 is 60°, and it's derived from some property.

Let me think about the triangle formed by the diagonals and a side. For example, taking the diagonal WZ and the side WX. The angle at W between WX and WZ is 75°, as calculated earlier. If there's a way to split this 75° angle into smaller angles, like 60° and 15°, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, but how to establish that.

Wait, another approach: since the angle between the diagonals is 30°, and the diagonals are equal, then the triangles formed by the diagonals are isosceles with apex angle 30°, and base angles (at the rectangle's vertices) of (180-30)/2 = 75°, as before. If angle 6 is one of these base angles, it's 75°, which isn't an option. But perhaps there's a mistake in assuming angle 1 is the angle between the diagonals.

Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles in the triangle WAX, like the 75° angle at W, and angle 6 is another angle in another triangle. If angle 1 is 75°, but the problem says m∠1 = 30°, so that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 is not the angle between the diagonals, but another angle. Let me go back to the initial assumptions.

Initially, I assumed angle 1 is the angle between WA and XA, which gave us 30°, leading to the ratio of sides. If instead, angle 1 is one of the angles in triangle WAX, like the 75° angle at W, but the problem states it's 30°, so that wouldn't fit.

Wait, but if angle 1 is 30°, and it's one of the angles in triangle WAX, then that would mean that the other angles are 75°, which is not matching. So this suggests that angle 1 must be the angle between the diagonals, which is 30°, leading to the ratio of sides.

With that, and the other angles in the diagram, perhaps angle 6 is 60°, derived from some property.

Wait, if we consider the triangle formed by the diagonals and a side, and use trigonometry. For example, in triangle WAX, we have sides WA = AX = sqrt(2 + √3), and WX = 1. If we drop a perpendicular from A to WX, forming a right triangle, maybe we can find some angle.

Let me try that. Let's say from point A, drop a perpendicular to WX, meeting at point P. Then, AP is the height of triangle WAX. Let's compute AP.

Area of triangle WAX is (base * height)/2 = (1 * AP)/2. Also, using Heron's formula or other method.

Alternatively, using the formula for area with sides and included angle: (1/2)*WA*AX*sin(angle at A) = (1/2)*sqrt(2 + √3)*sqrt(2 + √3)*sin(30°) = (1/2)*(2 + √3)*(0.5) = (2 + √3)/4.

But also, area is (1 * AP)/2 => AP = (2 + √3)/2.

Now, in right triangle WAP, we have hypotenuse WA = sqrt(2 + √3), and height AP = (2 + √3)/2.

Let me compute the angle at W, which is 75°, as before. But how does this help?

Alternatively, in triangle WAP, the angle at W is part of the 75° angle. But I'm not seeing a connection to 60°.

Another idea: since the angle between the diagonals is 30°, and the rectangle's sides are in a ratio of 1 : (2 + √3), which is approximately 1 : 3.732. This suggests that the rectangle is very elongated. In such a rectangle, the diagonals form a 30° angle, and if we consider the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides, perhaps there are 30-60-90 triangles involved.

Wait, for example, if we take the diagonal WZ, which has length sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(1 + (2 + √3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 7 + 4√3) = sqrt(8 + 4√3). Let me compute this:
