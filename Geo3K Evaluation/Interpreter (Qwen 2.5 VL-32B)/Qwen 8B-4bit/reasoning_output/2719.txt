Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points labeled A to O, and lines p, q, r. Line p has points A, B, C, D, E, F. Line q has points I, J, K, L, M, N, O. There's another line r connecting G and H. Then there are several angles mentioned. Let me list out all the given angle measures and relationships.

First, the angles along line p: Angle ABC (which is angle at B between A, B, C) is given as 3x - 60. Then angle BCD (at point C between B, C, D) is y. Wait, but there's also a RightAngle for angle BCD? Wait, looking back, the predicates say RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)). So angle BCD is a right angle, so it should be 90 degrees. But they also mention Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), y). So that means y = 90 degrees. 

Then, angle CDE (at point D between C, D, E) is x. Also, angle DEF (at point E between D, E, F) is given as 2x + 15. Then there's angle FGH (at point G between F, G, H) which is 2x + 15? Wait, no, wait. Wait the first angle given is MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals 3x - 60. Then MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H)) is 2x + 15. Then MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) is y, which is a right angle. Then MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)) is x. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(E,F,G)), so angle EFG is 90 degrees. 

Additionally, there are some sum relations. SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)), 180). Since angle BCD is y=90, and angle CDE is x, then 90 + x = 180 → x = 90 degrees? Wait, but then angle CDE would be 90 degrees. But then another sum says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,F)), 180). So angle CDE (x) plus angle DEF (which is 2x+15) equals 180. Wait, but if x is 90, then angle DEF would be 2*90 +15= 195, which added to x=90 gives 285, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong. Maybe I misread something.

Wait let me re-examine the predicates. The first angle is MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals 3x -60. Then MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H)) equals 2x +15. Then MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) equals y. And there's a RightAngle on Angle(B,C,D), so that angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, y = 90. Then MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)) equals x. Then there's another sum: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)), MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)), 180). Which is y + x = 180. Since y is 90, then x = 90. But then, the next sum is SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,F)), 180). So x + measure of angle DEF = 180. If x is 90, then measure of angle DEF is 90. But angle DEF is part of line p. Let me check the angles again. 

Wait, angle DEF is angle at E between D, E, F. So that's angle DEF. Now, since line p is straight, the points A, B, C, D, E, F are colinear. So each consecutive angle would be adjacent. Wait, but how do these angles relate? Because if points are on a straight line, then the angles formed at each point... Wait, maybe those angles are not the internal angles of a polygon but rather angles formed by intersecting lines?

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not the angles of a polygon but angles formed by the intersection of lines. For example, angle ABC is the angle at point B between lines BA and BC. Similarly, angle BCD is at point C between BC and CD. But since points A,B,C,D,E,F are colinear on line p, then the angles at each point between consecutive segments would be straight angles (180 degrees), unless there are other lines involved. However, in the problem, there are two lines, p and q, which are parallel. Also, line r intersects line p at point C and line q at point E. So, line r connects G and H, intersecting p at C and q at E. So, points C and E are where line r crosses lines p and q respectively. 

So, considering that, maybe the angles mentioned are not just along line p but involve other lines. For instance, angle ABC is at point B, but since line p is straight, that would imply that there's another line forming that angle. Wait, but the problem mentions angles like ABC, BCD, etc., which are angles formed by three points. Given that points A,B,C,D,... are on line p, then angle ABC would be a straight angle if there's no other line. But since there are other lines, like line r passing through C, maybe those angles are formed by line p and line r. Wait, but line r passes through C, so at point C, line r meets line p. So, angle at point C between line p and line r. But the problem states that angle BCD is a right angle. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: line p has points A---B---C---D---E---F. Line q is parallel to line p, and intersects line r at points C and E. Wait, no, line r is intersected by line p at C and line q at E. So, line r connects G and H, crossing line p at C and line q at E. So, line r is transversal cutting through lines p and q. 

Now, the angles mentioned: angle ABC is at point B between points A, B, C. Since points A, B, C are on line p, angle ABC would be a straight angle (180 degrees) unless there's another line involved. But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 3x -60. So that suggests that angle ABC is not a straight angle, implying that there's another line creating that angle. Perhaps line r? Wait, but line r intersects line p at C, not at B. So maybe angle ABC is formed by line p and another line? Or maybe the angles are not on the same line? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are not all on line p, but involve other lines. For example, angle ABC could be formed by lines AB and BC, but since those are parts of line p, that would still be a straight line. So this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the labels are different. Let me check the given predicates again. 

Wait, the first line is Line(p, A, B, C, D, E, F). So line p contains points A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Similarly, line q has points I, J, K, L, M, N, O. Line r is between G and H. 

Angles given: 
- Angle(A, B, C): this is angle at B between A-B-C. Since A, B, C are colinear on line p, this angle would normally be 180°, but the problem says it's 3x - 60. So that implies that there's another line forming this angle. Wait, maybe line r? If line r passes through B? No, because line r intersects line p at C, not at B. So maybe there's another line involved? Or perhaps the angles are not all on the same line. Alternatively, maybe the angles are not simple angles but involve other lines. For example, if there's a line starting at B and going somewhere else, creating an angle with BA and BC. But without more info, this is unclear. 

This confusion suggests that maybe I need to focus on the equations given, even if the diagram isn't fully clear. Let's proceed algebraically with the given equations.

We know that angle BCD is a right angle (90°), so y = 90. From the sum of angles BCD and CDE being 180°, since angle BCD is y=90, then angle CDE (which is x) must be 90°, so x = 90. But then angle DEF (which is angle at E between D-E-F) would be part of line p, but if x is 90, then angle DEF would be measured as per some relation. Wait, but the second sum says angle CDE (x) plus angle DEF (which is angle D-E-F?) equals 180. Wait, angle DEF would be the angle at E between D-E-F, which again, if points D, E, F are on line p, then that angle would be 180°, but according to the equation, x + angle DEF = 180. If x is 90, then angle DEF would be 90°, but that contradicts unless there's another line involved. 

This inconsistency suggests that my initial interpretation may be incorrect. Let me re-examine the angle definitions. 

Maybe the angles are not all along line p. For example, angle ABC could be formed by line p and another line, such as line r. Since line r intersects line p at point C, but not at B. So, maybe angle ABC is formed by BA and BC, but BC is part of line p. Unless there's another line creating that angle. Alternatively, perhaps angle ABC is formed by BA and BG, where G is a point on line r? But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles refer to angles formed by the transversal line r with line p and line q. Since line r intersects line p at C and line q at E. So, line r is a transversal cutting lines p and q. Given that p is parallel to q, then corresponding angles would be equal. 

But how does this connect with the given angles? Let's think about the angles mentioned. For example, angle FGH is given as 2x + 15. But point F is on line p, and G and H are endpoints of line r. So angle FGH would be at point G between F-G-H. But point G is connected to H via line r, which intersects line p at C. So point G is probably not on line p. 

This is quite confusing without a diagram. But since the problem refers to a figure, and the user mentions "the figure at the right," but I don't have access to it. So I'll have to work with the given predicates and equations. 

Let me try focusing on the equations first. We have:

From the sum of angles BCD (y) and CDE (x) equals 180°. Since angle BCD is a right angle (y=90), then x = 90°. 

Then, the next sum is angle CDE (x) + angle DEF = 180°. So x + angle DEF = 180. If x is 90, then angle DEF = 90°. 

But angle DEF is at point E between D-E-F. Since points D, E, F are on line p, then angle DEF would typically be a straight angle (180°), unless there's another line involved. However, since line r passes through E (as it intersects line q at E?), wait line r intersects line q at E? Wait, the predicate says IntersectAt(Line(q, ...), Line(r, ...), Point(E)). So line q and line r intersect at point E. Therefore, at point E, line q and line r meet. So angle DEF would be formed by DE (part of line p) and EF (also part of line p), but since line r passes through E, maybe angle DEF is formed by line r and line p at point E. So angle between line p and line r at point E. 

Ah! That's a possibility. So angle DEF is actually the angle between line p (containing points D-E-F) and line r at point E. Similarly, angle at point C between line p and line r would be angle BCE or something. 

Given that lines p and q are parallel, and line r is a transversal intersecting them at points C and E. Therefore, the angles formed at these intersections would follow the rules of parallel lines. 

For example, the angle at C between line p and line r would correspond to the angle at E between line q and line r. Since p || q, then corresponding angles are equal. 

Let me try to formalize this. Let's denote:

At point C, line r intersects line p. The angle between line p and line r at C is some value. Similarly, at point E, line r intersects line q. Since p || q, the corresponding angles would be equal. 

But how does this relate to the angles given? 

Looking back, the angle DEF (at E) is the angle between line p (since E is on line p) and line r. Let's call that angle θ. Then, due to the parallel lines, the angle at C between line p and line r would also be θ. 

But earlier, we had angle DEF = 90° (if x=90), which would mean θ = 90°, making the angle at C between p and r also 90°, which would imply that line r is perpendicular to line p. But is that necessarily true? Not sure yet. 

Also, angle FGH is given as 2x + 15. Let's assume that angle FGH is at point G between F-G-H. Since line r connects G and H, and intersects line p at C and line q at E. So point G is one end of line r, and H is the other. Depending on the direction of line r, angle FGH could be an external angle involving line r and possibly other lines. 

Alternatively, maybe angle FGH relates to the angle at point G between FG and GH. If line r goes from G to H, and point F is on line p, then FG would be a segment from F to G. But without knowing the exact position, it's hard to tell. 

Perhaps I should focus on solving the equations first, assuming that the variables can be found through the given equations, and then use those to find the desired angle. 

We have:

1. y = 90 (from RightAngle on angle BCD).
2. From SumOf(angle BCD, angle CDE) = 180 => y + x = 180 => x = 90.
3. From SumOf(angle CDE, angle DEF) = 180 => x + angle DEF = 180 => angle DEF = 90. So angle DEF is 90°.
4. MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 3x -60. Since x=90, this becomes 3*90 -60 = 270 -60 = 210°. But angle ABC is supposed to be an angle at point B, which if it's formed by line p and another line, but if it's 210°, that's more than 180°, which would imply a reflex angle. Is that possible? Maybe, depending on the configuration.

However, this leads to inconsistencies. For example, angle ABC being 210°, angle BCD being 90°, angle CDE being 90°, angle DEF being 90°, and angle FGH being 2x +15 = 2*90 +15 = 2*90 is 180 +15=195°. 

But then, there's also the RightAngle on angle EFG. Angle EFG is at point F between E-F-G. If angle EFG is a right angle (90°), and angle DEF is 90°, and angle FGH is 195°, this seems inconsistent with typical geometric configurations. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in my assumptions. Perhaps x is not 90°, but there's another way to interpret the equations. Let me re-examine the equations carefully.

Wait, the sum of angle BCD (y) and angle CDE (x) equals 180°. Since y is 90°, then x = 90°, yes. But then angle DEF is angle at E between D-E-F, which is on line p. If line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be the angle between line p and line r at E, which is supplementary to some other angle. 

Alternatively, maybe angle DEF is not directly on line p but involves line r. For example, if line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be formed by DE (on line p) and EF (on line p), but also involving line r. Wait, that's not possible unless there's another line. 

Alternatively, maybe angle DEF is referring to angle between line p and line r at E. So angle DEF is the angle between DE and EF, but DE and EF are collinear (since they're on line p), so that angle would be zero. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle DEF is formed by extending some lines. For example, if line r passes through E, then at point E, there's an angle between line q and line r. Since p || q, and line r is a transversal, the corresponding angles would be equal. 

Let me consider that. At point E, line q and line r form an angle. Since p || q, the angle at E between line q and line r would be equal to the angle at C between line p and line r. 

Let me denote that angle at C between line p and line r as α, and angle at E between line q and line r as β. Since p || q, α = β. 

Now, angle DEF is at point E between D-E-F. Points D-E-F are on line p, so angle DEF is a straight angle (180°) unless there's another line involved. Wait, but if line r passes through E, then the angle between line p and line r at E would be either α or its supplement. 

Assume that at point E, line r forms an angle α with line p. Then, angle DEF (which is the angle between DE and EF on line p) would be a straight angle, but if we consider the angle between line r and line p, that's α. So maybe angle DEF is related to α? 

Alternatively, maybe angle DEF is the exterior angle at E, which would be supplementary to α. 

But this is getting too vague without seeing the actual diagram. Let me try to use the given equations and see if there's another way. 

We have:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 3x -60. 

If angle ABC is formed by line p and another line, say, line r. Suppose that line r passes through B, but according to the given, line r intersects line p at C. So line r cannot pass through B. Hence, angle ABC must be formed by line p and another line that starts at B. But since we don't have information about other lines, this is unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not all on line p but involve other lines. For example, angle ABC is formed by BA and BC, which are on line p, making it a straight angle. But the given measure is 3x -60, which would require that 3x -60 = 180 ⇒ 3x = 240 ⇒ x = 80. But earlier, we thought x was 90. This contradiction suggests that my previous assumption about angle BCD being 90° leading to x=90 is wrong. 

Wait, hold on. The problem says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle BCD. So angle BCD is a right angle, hence 90°. But angle BCD is also given as y, and from the sum of angle BCD and angle CDE equals 180°. So if angle BCD is 90°, then angle CDE (which is x) is 90°, making x=90. But then, angle DEF is angle D-E-F, which would be part of line p, but if line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be related to the angle between line p and line r at E. 

Assuming that, then angle DEF (let's call it z) is supplementary to the angle between line r and line p at E. Since p || q, and line r is a transversal, the angle at E between line q and line r would be equal to the angle at C between line p and line r. 

Let me define:

At point C, line r intersects line p, forming an angle of α. At point E, line r intersects line q, forming an angle β. Since p || q, α = β. 

Now, angle DEF at point E between D-E-F (line p) would be supplementary to β, assuming that β is the angle between line q and line r. Thus, angle DEF = 180° - β. 

Similarly, angle at point C between line p and line r is α = β. 

But how does this relate to the given equations? 

We have angle DEF = 180° - β. Also, from the sum of angle CDE (x) and angle DEF = 180°, so x + (180° - β) = 180° ⇒ x = β. 

Since α = β, and α is the angle at C between line p and line r. 

Now, what is α? It depends on other angles. Let's look at angle FGH, which is given as 2x +15. Let's try to relate this. 

Angle FGH is at point G between F-G-H. Assuming line r passes through G and H, and F is on line p. So, angle FGH would be formed by FG and GH. If line r is extended beyond G to H, then FG is part of line r. So, angle FGH would be the angle between FG (part of line r) and GH (also part of line r), which is a straight line, so it's 180°. But that can't be, since it's given as 2x +15. So this suggests that angle FGH is not a straight angle, implying that there's another line involved. 

Alternatively, maybe angle FGH is formed by lines FG and GH, where FG is a segment from F to G, and GH is from G to H. If line r passes through G and H, then FG is part of line r. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe angle FGH is formed by lines GF and GH, where GF is part of line p (since F is on line p) and GH is part of line r. So angle FGH would be the angle between line p and line r at point G. But point G is on line r, so if line r intersects line p at C, then G could be on one side of C. 

This is very ambiguous without the diagram. But perhaps we can proceed with the equations we have. 

We have:

From the first sum: y + x = 180°, and y = 90°, so x = 90°. 

From the second sum: x + angle DEF = 180°, so angle DEF = 90°. 

Now, angle DEF is 90°, which we assumed is 180° - β, so 90° = 180° - β ⇒ β = 90°. Thus, β = 90°, which means angle at E between line q and line r is 90°, so line r is perpendicular to line q at E. Since p || q, this would imply that line r is perpendicular to p at C as well. 

Thus, line r is perpendicular to both p and q. 

Now, angle at C between line p and line r is 90°, which is α = 90°. 

Now, what about angle ABC? It's given as 3x -60. With x = 90, this is 3*90 -60 = 210°. But angle ABC is at point B, which is on line p. If line r is perpendicular to line p at C, then at point B, there might be another line forming angle ABC. 

But how? If line r is perpendicular to line p at C, then at point B, which is before C on line p, there might be another line forming angle ABC. For example, if there's a line starting at B and intersecting line r at some point, creating angle ABC. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is formed by line AB and BC, but since those are collinear, it's a straight angle. But according to the given, it's 210°, which is impossible. This suggests that my assumption about x = 90° is wrong, indicating an error in earlier steps. 

Wait, but where? Let me go back. 

We have angle BCD is a right angle (y=90). Sum of angle BCD (y) and angle CDE (x) equals 180°. So x = 90. This seems unavoidable. But if x=90, then angle DEF = 90°, which led us to β = 90°, implying line r is perpendicular to p and q. 

But angle ABC is 3x -60 = 210°, which is impossible for a standard angle. So this suggests that there's an error in interpreting the angles. Perhaps angle ABC is not a standard angle but a reflex angle? Or maybe it's not formed by the lines on line p but involves another line. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the ones I think they are. Let me recheck the angle names. 

Angle(A, B, C) is the angle at B between points A, B, C. Since A, B, C are on line p, this angle would normally be a straight angle (180°), but if there's another line creating this angle at B, then it could be different. 

Suppose there's another line passing through B, say line s, forming angle ABC with line p. If that line s is not specified, but given that line r passes through C, maybe there's a relationship between lines. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BC, which are parts of line p, but since they are colinear, the angle is 180°, but the problem says it's 3x -60. So this implies that 3x -60 = 180° ⇒ 3x = 240 ⇒ x = 80. 

But earlier, from the sum of angle BCD (y=90) and angle CDE (x) = 180°, x=90. This contradiction suggests that there's a mistake in assuming that angle CDE is x. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Looking back, the predicates state:

Angle(C, D, E) is x. So angle at D between C-D-E. Since points C, D, E are on line p, this would be a straight angle (180°), unless there's another line involved. But if line r passes through D, then angle CDE would be formed by line r and line p at D. 

Wait, but line r intersects line p at C, not at D. So if line r passes through C, then at point D, there's no intersection with line r. So angle CDE at point D between C-D-E is still a straight angle, which would mean x=180°, but that conflicts with the previous calculation. 

This is extremely confusing. Perhaps the key lies in recognizing that the angles given are not all along line p but involve other lines. For example, angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BC, which are on line p, but if there's another line forming that angle at B. 

But without additional information, it's difficult to proceed. Let me try to focus on the equations and see if there's a way to resolve the contradictions. 

From the first sum: y + x = 180, with y=90, so x=90. 

From the second sum: x + angle DEF = 180 ⇒ angle DEF = 90. 

Now, angle DEF is at E between D-E-F, which is on line p, so if line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be the angle between line r and line p at E. Let's say that angle is α. Then, since p || q, and line r is a transversal, the corresponding angle at C would also be α. 

So, angle at C between line p and line r is α. Also, angle at E between line q and line r is α. 

Now, angle DEF is the angle between line p and line r at E, which is α. So, α = angle DEF = 90°. Hence, line r is perpendicular to line p at C and E. 

Now, angle ABC is at B between A-B-C. If line r is perpendicular to line p at C, then at point B, there might be another line forming angle ABC. Let's say there's a line from B to some point, say, G, forming angle ABC. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

However, the measure of angle ABC is given as 3x -60. If x=90, then this is 3*90 -60 = 210°, which is a reflex angle. Perhaps this is acceptable. 

Now, moving to angle FGH, which is 2x +15. With x=90, this is 2*90 +15 = 195°. So angle FGH is 195°, which is also a reflex angle. 

But how does this relate to the rest? 

Now, the question asks for m∠FCE. Let's identify this angle. Point F is on line p, point C is where line r intersects line p, and point E is where line r intersects line q. So, ∠FCE is the angle at point C between points F, C, E. 

Point F is on line p, and point E is on line q. Since line r passes through C and E, ∠FCE is the angle at C between line CF (which is part of line p) and CE (which is part of line r). 

Since line r is perpendicular to line p at C (as we deduced earlier, since α=90°), then ∠FCE is the angle between line p (CF) and line r (CE), which is 90°. But wait, that would make ∠FCE = 90°, but none of the answer choices is 90. The options are A. 105, B. 110, C. 115, D. 120. 

This suggests that my assumption that α=90° is incorrect. Where is the mistake? 

Earlier, we said that angle DEF = 90°, and angle DEF is the angle between line p and line r at E, which is α. But if line r is perpendicular to line p at C, then at E, the angle between line q and line r is also α. But since line q is parallel to line p, and line r is perpendicular to p, it would also be perpendicular to q. So, at point E, angle between line q and line r is 90°, making α=90°. 

But then ∠FCE is the angle between line p and line r at C, which is 90°, but this doesn't match any answer choice. This indicates a flaw in the reasoning. 

Let me reconsider. Maybe angle DEF is not α but something else. 

If line r is not perpendicular, but instead makes an angle β with line p at C, then at point E, due to parallel lines, the angle with line q would be β. 

Then, angle DEF is the angle at E between D-E-F, which is on line p, and if line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be supplementary to β. So, angle DEF = 180° - β. 

From the second sum, x + angle DEF = 180°. Substituting angle DEF = 180° - β, we get x + (180° - β) = 180° ⇒ x = β. 

Now, β is the angle between line r and line p at C, which is also the angle between line r and line q at E. 

Now, what about angle ABC? Let's assume it's formed by line AB and line BC, which are on line p, but if there's another line forming this angle. For example, if line r passes through B, but it doesn't, as per the given. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BG, where G is a point on line r. If line r passes through B, but it doesn't, as per the given, since line r intersects line p at C. 

This is very tangled. Maybe I should abandon trying to find x and focus on finding m∠FCE directly. 

∠FCE is the angle at C between F, C, E. F is on line p, E is on line q, and C is the intersection of line r with line p. So, ∠FCE is the angle between line CF (part of line p) and line CE (part of line r). 

Since line r intersects line q at E, and p || q, the angle at E between line q and line r is equal to the angle at C between line p and line r. Let's call this angle θ. So, ∠FCE = θ. 

Now, we need to find θ. To find θ, we might need to use other angles. 

From earlier, we have angle DEF = 180° - θ (assuming angle DEF is supplementary to θ). From the second sum, x + angle DEF = 180°, so x + (180° - θ) = 180° ⇒ x = θ. 

Also, angle ABC = 3x -60. If we can express angle ABC in terms of θ, we might find x. 

But how? Let's think. Angle ABC is at point B between A, B, C. If line r passes through B, then angle ABC would involve line r. But line r passes through C, not B. So, perhaps angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BC, which are on line p, making it a straight angle, but this would mean 3x -60 = 180 ⇒ x = 80. 

If x = 80, then θ = x = 80°, so ∠FCE = 80°, which is not among the answer choices. 

But this contradicts the earlier conclusion from the sum of angle BCD and CDE. 

Wait, let's try this new approach: Assume that angle ABC is 3x -60, and if it's a straight angle, then 3x -60 = 180 ⇒ x = 80. 

Then, from the first sum: y + x = 180, with y=90, x=80. Wait, 90 + 80 = 170 ≠ 180. Contradiction. 

So this is not working. 

Alternative approach: Let's forget about the angles on line p and focus on the equations given. 

We have:

1. y = 90° (from RightAngle on angle BCD).

2. y + x = 180° ⇒ x = 90°.

3. x + angle DEF = 180° ⇒ angle DEF = 90°.

4. MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 3x -60 = 3*90 -60 = 210°.

5. MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H)) = 2x +15 = 2*90 +15 = 195°.

6. RightAngle on Angle(E,F,G) ⇒ angle EFG = 90°.

Now, with these values, let's try to find ∠FCE.

Assuming ∠FCE is the angle at C between F, C, E. As discussed, this is the angle between line CF (part of line p) and line CE (part of line r). Let's call this angle θ. 

Since line r intersects line q at E, and p || q, the angle at E between line q and line r is equal to θ (corresponding angles). 

Now, at point E, angle between line q and line r is θ. Also, angle EFG is a right angle (90°). Let's see if we can relate this. 

Angle EFG is at point F between E-F-G. If line r passes through E and G, then angle EFG could be formed by line FE (part of line p) and line FG (part of line r). So, angle EFG is the angle between line p and line r at F. 

Wait, but point F is on line p. If line r passes through F, then angle EFG would be the angle between line r and line p at F. But line r intersects line p at C, not at F. So, unless line r passes through F, which it doesn't, this is not possible. 

This is very confusing. Maybe I should try to find θ using the given angles. 

If angle DEF = 90°, and it is the angle at E between D-E-F (on line p), and if line r passes through E, then angle DEF could be the angle between line r and line p at E, which is θ. So, angle DEF = θ = 90°. Hence, θ = 90°, making ∠FCE = 90°, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle DEF is supplementary to θ, then θ = 180° - angle DEF = 180° - 90° = 90°. Same result. 

This suggests that ∠FCE is 90°, but since this isn't an option, there must be a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps ∠FCE is not θ but something else. Let me think. 

Point F is on line p, point C is on line p, and point E is on line q. Line r passes through C and E. So, ∠FCE is the angle at C between F-C-E. Since F and C are on line p, and E is on line q, this angle is formed by line CF (part of line p) and line CE (part of line r). 

Since line r is a transversal intersecting line p at C and line q at E, and p || q, the angle at C between line p and line r is equal to the angle at E between line q and line r. Let's call this angle θ. 

Now, angle at E between line q and line r is θ. But at point E, there's also angle EFG, which is a right angle. If angle EFG is the angle between line q and line r at E, then θ = 90°, making ∠FCE = 90°. 

Again, this leads to 90°, which is not an option. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the assumptions. Perhaps the initial equations are to be solved differently. 

Let me try solving the equations without assuming x from the first sum. 

We have:

1. y = 90°.

2. y + x = 180° ⇒ x = 90°.

3. x + angle DEF = 180° ⇒ angle DEF = 90°.

4. MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 3x -60 = 3*90 -60 = 210°.

5. MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,H)) = 2x +15 = 2*90 +15 = 195°.

6. RightAngle on Angle(E,F,G) ⇒ angle EFG = 90°.

Now, let's consider angle EFG = 90°. This is at point F between E-F-G. If line r passes through F, then this angle would be between line r and line p at F. But line r passes through C, not F. So, unless there's another line, this is unclear. 

Maybe angle EFG is formed by line EF (part of line p) and line FG (some other line). If line r passes through G, then FG is part of line r. So, angle EFG is the angle between line p and line r at F. 

But line r passes through C, not F. So, unless line r extends to F, which it doesn't, this is not possible. 

This is a dead end. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that angle ABC is not on line p but involves another line, and thus 3x -60 is not 180°. Let's set up equations with variables. 

Let me denote:

Let x be the value such that MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,E)) = x.

From the sum of angle BCD (y=90) and angle CDE (x) = 180 ⇒ x = 90.

From the sum of angle CDE (x=90) and angle DEF = 180 ⇒ angle DEF = 90.

Now, angle DEF is at E between D-E-F. If this is a straight angle, it's 180°, but it's given as 90°, so this suggests that it's not a straight angle. Hence, there must be another line forming this angle at E. 

Assuming that line r passes through E, then angle DEF is the angle between line p and line r at E, which is 90°, making line r perpendicular to line p at E. But earlier, line r intersects line p at C, so if it's perpendicular at C and E, that would mean line r is perpendicular to line p at both C and E, which is only possible if C and E are the same point, which they aren't. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there is no solution under these constraints, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not all on line p but involve other lines. For example, angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BC, but if line r passes through B, then it creates an angle. But line r intersects line p at C, not at B. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is formed by line AB and line BG, where G is on line r. If line r passes through G, then angle ABC would be between AB and BG. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to calculate. 

Given the time spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's focus on the answer choices and see which one fits. 

The question is to find m∠FCE. Let's assume that ∠FCE is the angle between line CF (part of line p) and line CE (part of line r). Since line r intersects line p at C and line q at E, and p || q, the angle between line r and p at C is equal to the angle between line r and q at E. 

Let's call this angle θ. 

Now, at point E, the angle between line q and line r is θ. Also, at point E, there is angle EFG, which is a right angle (90°). If this angle EFG is related to θ, then perhaps θ = 90°, making ∠FCE = 90°, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle EFG is supplementary to θ, then θ = 90°, same result. 

Alternatively, if angle EFG is part of a triangle or something. 

Wait, angle EFG is at point F between E-F-G. If line r passes through G, then FG is part of line r, and EF is part of line p. So, angle EFG is the angle between line p and line r at F. But since line r passes through C, not F, this is only possible if F is on line r, which it isn't. 

This is too ambiguous. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the equations. 

From the earlier equations, x = 90°, and angle DEF = 90°, which might suggest that ∠FCE is 90°, but since this isn't an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, perhaps the measure of angle FGH is 2x +15 = 195°, which is
