Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the provided predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( C \)
- Points \( E, F, G, H \)
- Lines \( EF \) and \( HG \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{LengthOf}(EF) = 8x + 6 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(HG) = 10x - 4 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( EF \) is a chord of circle \( C \)
- \( HG \) is a chord of circle \( C \)

**Goal:**
- Find the value of \( x \) such that the lengths of the chords \( EF \) and \( HG \) are equal, given they are chords of the same circle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since both \( EF \) and \( HG \) are chords of the same circle \( C \), and we are given their lengths in terms of \( x \), we can equate the expressions for their lengths to find \( x \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \( x \), we set the lengths of the chords equal to each other:

\[
8x + 6 = 10x - 4
\]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Solve the equation:

1. Subtract \( 8x \) from both sides:

   \[
   6 = 2x - 4
   \]

2. Add 4 to both sides:

   \[
   10 = 2x
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify the solution by substituting \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for the lengths of the chords:

- \( \text{LengthOf}(EF) = 8(5) + 6 = 40 + 6 = 46 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(HG) = 10(5) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \)

Both lengths are equal, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is correct.

Compare with the answer choices:

- A. 1.8
- B. 5
- C. 46
- D. 90

The correct answer is \( x = 5 \).
