Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( B \)
- Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \)
- Lines: \( AB, CE, BD \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( CE = 13.5 \) (Diameter of circle \( B \))
- \( AB = 8 \) (Radius of circle \( B \))
- \( BD \) is a radius of circle \( B \)

**Relationships:**
- \( CE \) is the diameter of circle \( B \).
- \( AB \) and \( BD \) are radii of circle \( B \).
- \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( CE \).

**Positioning:**
- Points \( A, C, D, E, F \) lie on circle \( B \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( CE \) is the diameter, the center \( B \) is the midpoint of \( CE \).
- \( AB = BD = 8 \) because they are radii of the circle.
- \( CE = 13.5 \) implies the radius \( r = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75 \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \) where \( BD \) is a radius and \( BC \) is half the diameter.
- Since \( B \) is the center, \( BC = \frac{CE}{2} = 6.75 \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify Triangle:**
   - \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**
   \[
   BC^2 + BD^2 = CD^2
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - \( BC = 6.75 \)
   - \( BD = 8 \)

4. **Calculate \( CD \):**
   \[
   6.75^2 + 8^2 = CD^2
   \]
   \[
   45.5625 + 64 = CD^2
   \]
   \[
   CD^2 = 109.5625
   \]
   \[
   CD = \sqrt{109.5625} \approx 10.47
   \]

5. **Find \( BD \):**
   - Since \( BD \) is a radius, \( BD = 8 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We need to find \( BD \), which is already known as a radius.
- \( BD = 8 \) is consistent with the radius calculation.
- The perpendicularity and diameter properties confirm the setup.

Since \( BD = 8 \) is not directly among the answer choices, we must have misunderstood the requirement. The problem asks for \( BD \) in the context of the perpendicular setup, which was already verified as \( 8 \). However, the question seems to imply finding a segment related to the perpendicular intersection, which is \( CD \).

- The closest answer to \( CD \approx 10.47 \) is not listed, indicating a possible misinterpretation. Re-evaluate the perpendicular setup:
  - \( BD \) is indeed \( 8 \), but the perpendicular intersection implies using the Pythagorean theorem to find the segment \( BD \) in the context of the perpendicular intersection, which is \( 6.75 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
