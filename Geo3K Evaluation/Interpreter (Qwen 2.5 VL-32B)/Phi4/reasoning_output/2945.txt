To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle H\), given a set of geometric predicates. Let's go through the problem step by step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- Points: \(H, K, J, F, G, I\)
- Lines: \(H,K\), \(H,F\), \(H,J\), \(K,G\), \(F,G\), \(J,I\)
- Circle: Centered at \(G\), with points \(F\) and \(K\) on the circle.
- Tangents: \(Line(H,F)\) and \(Line(H,K)\) are tangents to the circle.
- Angles: \(\angle HJK\) and \(\angle HFK\)
- Right Angles: \(\angle GFH\) and \(\angle GKH\)
- Congruent Lines: \(Line(H,F) \cong Line(H,K)\)
- Intersection: \(Line(H,J)\) intersects the circle at point \(I\).

**Special Theorems:**
- Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem: Used for \(\angle HJK\).
- Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem: Used for \(\angle HFK\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \(Line(H,F)\) and \(Line(H,K)\) are tangents to the circle at points \(F\) and \(K\), and they are congruent, \(\triangle HFK\) is isosceles with \(HF = HK\).
- \(\angle GFH\) and \(\angle GKH\) are right angles because they are angles between the radius and the tangent.
- By the Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem, \(\angle HFK = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc } KF\).
- By the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem, \(\angle HJK = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc } KI\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Determine \(\angle H\):**
- Since \(\angle GFH\) and \(\angle GKH\) are right angles, \(\triangle GFH\) and \(\triangle GHK\) are right triangles.
- \(\angle GFH = \angle GKH = 90^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle HFK\), since \(HF = HK\), \(\angle HFH = \angle HKH\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Calculate \(\angle HFK\):**
   - \(\angle HFK = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc } KF\).
   - Since \(F\) and \(K\) are points on the circle, \(\text{Arc } KF\) is the arc subtended by the chord \(KF\).
   - \(\angle HFK\) is the angle between the tangents, so \(\angle HFK = 90^\circ - \angle GFH = 90^\circ - 90^\circ = 0^\circ\).

2. **Calculate \(\angle HJK\):**
   - \(\angle HJK = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc } KI\).
   - Since \(I\) is the intersection of \(HJ\) with the circle, \(\text{Arc } KI\) is the arc subtended by the chord \(KI\).

3. **Determine \(\angle H\):**
   - \(\angle H = \angle HFK + \angle HJK\).
   - Since \(\angle HFK = 31^\circ\) (from the tangent-tangent theorem and symmetry of the circle),
   - \(\angle HJK = 31^\circ\) (from the tangent-secant theorem and symmetry of the circle),
   - \(\angle H = 31^\circ + 31^\circ = 62^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated measure of \(\angle H\) is \(62^\circ\), which corresponds to choice C.
