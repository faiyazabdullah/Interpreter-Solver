PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem using the structured approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circles: G, J, K
- Points: G, H, J, K, L

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length(GH) = 10
- Length(GL) = 5

**Relationships:**
- GH is a diameter of Circle G.
- GL and JL are radii of Circles G and J, respectively.

**Positioning:**
- Point L lies on Circles G, J, and K.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- Length JL

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since GH is a diameter of Circle G and GH = 10, the radius of Circle G is 10/2 = 5.
- Given that GL is a radius of Circle G and GL = 5, this confirms that L is on Circle G.
- Since JL is a radius of Circle J and L is on Circle J, JL is also a radius of Circle J.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find the length of JL.
- Since L is on Circle J and JL is a radius, the length of JL is equal to the radius of Circle J.
- We know from the properties of circles that all radii of a circle are equal.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- From the given information, GL = 5, and since L is on Circle G, GL is a radius of Circle G.
- Since JL is also a radius of Circle J, and all radii of a circle are equal, JL must also be 5.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated length of JL is 5, which matches one of the answer choices.
- The answer choice that corresponds to JL = 5 is A.

Final Answer: A
