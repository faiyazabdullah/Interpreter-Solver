Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle(X): Circle with center X.
- Points: W, Y, X.

**Lines and Lines' Properties:**
- Line(X,W): Line segment connecting X and W.
- Line(X,Y): Line segment connecting X and Y.
- IsRadiusOf(Line(X,W), Circle(X)): Line(X,W) is a radius of Circle(X).
- IsRadiusOf(Line(X,Y), Circle(X)): Line(X,Y) is a radius of Circle(X).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(X)), 2): Radius of Circle(X) is 2.
- Angle(W,X,Y): Angle formed at X by lines XW and XY.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)), 52): Measure of angle WXY is 52 degrees.

**Sector and Shading:**
- Sector(X, W, Y): Sector formed by center X and points W and Y.
- Shaded(Sector(X, W, Y)): Sector XWY is shaded.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- Find the area of the shaded sector XWY.

**Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- The formula for the area of a sector of a circle is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2\), where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

We have a circle with center X and radius 2. We need to find the area of the sector XWY where the central angle \(\angle WXY = 52^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find the area of the sector XWY, we will use the sector area formula:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \(\theta = 52^\circ\) and \(r = 2\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times (2)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times 4
\]
\[
= \frac{52 \times 4}{360} \times \pi
\]
\[
= \frac{208}{360} \times \pi
\]
Simplify \(\frac{208}{360}\):
\[
= \frac{52}{90} = \frac{26}{45}
\]
Thus, the area of the sector is:
\[
= \frac{26}{45} \times \pi
\]
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), calculate:
\[
= \frac{26}{45} \times 3.14159 \approx 1.8138
\]
Round to the nearest tenth:
\[
\approx 1.8
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated area of the shaded sector is approximately 1.8. Comparing this with the answer choices, we find:

- A. 0.9
- B. 1.8
- C. 10.8
- D. 12.6

The closest and correct answer is 1.8.
