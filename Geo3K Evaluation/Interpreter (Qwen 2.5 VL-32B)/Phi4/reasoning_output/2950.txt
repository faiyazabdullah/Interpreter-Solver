### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle: Circle(D)
- Points: Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D)
- Triangle: Triangle(A, B, C)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)) is what we need to find.

**Relationships:**
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(D)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(B), Circle(D)), PointLiesOnCircle(Point(C), Circle(D)) indicate that A, B, and C lie on Circle(D).
- IsCenterOf(Point(D), Circle(D)) tells us D is the center of the circle.

**Specific Value Sought:**
- We need to determine the measure of Angle(A, B, C).

**Special Theorems:**
- Since A, B, and C lie on Circle(D) with D as the center, angle ABC is an inscribed angle. The central angle ADB (where D is the center) subtended by the same arc AC is twice the inscribed angle ABC. This is a fundamental property of circles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since D is the center, segments DA, DB, and DC are radii of the circle and thus equal.
- Triangle(ABD) and Triangle(BCD) are isosceles (two sides are radii).
- The central angle ADB is twice the measure of the inscribed angle ABC.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Solution Path:**
- Use the inscribed angle theorem: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- If the central angle ADB is 180 degrees (a semicircle), then the inscribed angle ABC would be half of 180 degrees, which is 90 degrees.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify the Central Angle:**
   - The central angle ADB subtends the arc AC.
   - Since A, B, and C lie on the circle, the central angle ADB is the angle at the center formed by the radii DA and DB.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The inscribed angle ABC is half of the central angle ADB.
   - If ADB is a semicircle (180 degrees), then ABC = 180 / 2 = 90 degrees.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since A, B, and C are on the circle and D is the center, angle ABC is a right angle when ADB is a semicircle.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculation aligns with the geometric property that an inscribed angle subtending a semicircle is a right angle.
- The measure of angle ABC is 90 degrees.

**Final Answer: D**
