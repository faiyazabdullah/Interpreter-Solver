To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of segment \( QP \) in the parallelogram \( PQRS \).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- We have a parallelogram \( PQRS \) with points \( P, Q, R, \) and \( S \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{LengthOf}(PQ) = 5 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(QR) = 3 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(RS) = 5 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(SP) = 3 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( \text{Supplementary}(\angle PQR, \angle QPS) \)

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \( PQ = RS = 5 \)
- \( QR = SP = 3 \)

The supplementary angle condition \( \text{Supplementary}(\angle PQR, \angle QPS) \) confirms the properties of a parallelogram, where consecutive angles are supplementary.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

To find \( QP \), we recognize that \( QP \) is the diagonal of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. We can use the properties of parallelograms and the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

Since \( PQRS \) is a parallelogram, we can use the formula for the length of the diagonal \( d_1 \) (from \( P \) to \( R \)) in terms of the sides \( a \) and \( b \) and the angle \( \theta \) between them:

\[
d_1^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(\theta)
\]

For diagonal \( PR \):
- \( a = PQ = 5 \)
- \( b = QR = 3 \)

Since \( \angle PQR \) and \( \angle QPS \) are supplementary, \( \angle PQR + \angle QPS = 180^\circ \). In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so \( \angle PQR = \angle RSP \).

Using the law of cosines for diagonal \( PR \):
\[
PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 - 2 \cdot PQ \cdot QR \cdot \cos(\angle PQR)
\]

Since \( \angle PQR \) and \( \angle QPS \) are supplementary, \( \cos(\angle PQR) = -\cos(\angle QPS) \). However, we don't need the exact angle to find \( QP \) because:

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and using the properties of vectors or coordinate geometry, we can derive:

\[
QP^2 = \frac{1}{2}((PQ^2 + QR^2) + (RS^2 + SP^2))
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
QP^2 = \frac{1}{2}((5^2 + 3^2) + (5^2 + 3^2))
\]
\[
QP^2 = \frac{1}{2}((25 + 9) + (25 + 9))
\]
\[
QP^2 = \frac{1}{2}(34 + 34)
\]
\[
QP^2 = \frac{1}{2}(68)
\]
\[
QP^2 = 34
\]

Thus, \( QP = \sqrt{34} \).

Since \(\sqrt{34}\) is approximately 5.83, the closest integer choice is 5.

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

The calculated length \( QP = \sqrt{34} \approx 5.83 \) is closest to 5.
