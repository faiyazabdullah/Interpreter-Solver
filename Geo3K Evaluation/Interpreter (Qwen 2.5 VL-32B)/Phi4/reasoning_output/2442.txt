Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: Line(A, B) and Line(C, D)
- Angles: 
  - Angle(A, E, B)
  - Angle(B, E, D)
  - Angle(C, E, D)
  - Angle(A, E, C)

**Equal Angle Measures:**
- MeasureOf(Angle(A, E, B)) = x
- MeasureOf(Angle(B, E, D)) = x
- MeasureOf(Angle(C, E, D)) = x
- MeasureOf(Angle(A, E, C)) = x

We need to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

From the predicates, we have four angles that are equal in measure:
1. \( \angle AEB = x \)
2. \( \angle BED = x \)
3. \( \angle CED = x \)
4. \( \angle AEC = x \)

This suggests that point E is a common vertex for these angles, and the lines AE, BE, CE, and DE are involved.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

The angles around point E sum up to \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\angle AEB + \angle BED + \angle CED + \angle AEC = 360^\circ
\]

Since each angle is equal to \( x \), we have:
\[
x + x + x + x = 360^\circ
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
4x = 360^\circ
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
\]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

The calculation shows that each angle \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \). This makes sense geometrically, as the angles around a point sum to \( 360^\circ \), and having four equal angles implies each is \( 90^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated value of \( x = 90^\circ \) is one of the provided answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is:
