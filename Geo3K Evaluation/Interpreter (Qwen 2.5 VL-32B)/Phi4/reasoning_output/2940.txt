PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:

Let's systematically solve the problem using the given predicates and geometric reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( X \)
- Points: \( A, B, C, D, M, N, Y, Z \)
- Lines: \( AB, CD \)
- Chords: \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of circle \( X \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{Length of } AB = 30 \)
- \( \text{Length of } CD = 30 \)
- \( \text{Measure of arc } CZ = 40^\circ \)

**Relationships:**
- \( AB \cong CD \) (Congruent)
- \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of the same circle \( X \)

**Positioning:**
- \( CZ \) is an arc of circle \( X \)
- \( CD \) is also an arc of circle \( X \)

**Question:**
- Find \( m \widehat{CD} \) (the measure of arc \( CD \)).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are congruent chords of circle \( X \), they subtend congruent arcs. This means the arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) have the same measure.
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is given as \( 40^\circ \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorem Application:**
- Use the property that congruent chords in a circle subtend congruent arcs.
- The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify the Relationship:**
   - Since \( AB \cong CD \), the arcs \( AB \) and \( CD \) are congruent.
   - Therefore, \( m \widehat{AB} = m \widehat{CD} \).

2. **Arc \( CZ \) and \( CD \):**
   - We know \( m \widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \).
   - Since \( CZ \) and \( CD \) are parts of the circle and \( CD \) is congruent to \( AB \), the remaining arc \( CD \) must also be \( 40^\circ \) because \( CZ \) and \( CD \) are symmetrical around the center of the circle.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( m \widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \) and \( CD \) is congruent to \( AB \), the measure of arc \( CD \) is also \( 40^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of arc \( CD \) is \( 40^\circ \).
- Compare with answer choices: A. 30, B. 40, C. 60, D. 80.
- The correct choice is \( 40^\circ \).
