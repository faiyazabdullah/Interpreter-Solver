### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Circle: Circle(F)
- Lines: Line(A,B) and Line(C,D)
- Chords: Line(A,B) and Line(C,D) are chords of Circle(F)
- Intersection: Line(A,B) intersects Line(C,D) at Point(E)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Segment lengths: 
  - Length of Segment(A,E) = x
  - Length of Segment(E,C) = 3
  - Length of Segment(B,E) = 4
  - Length of Segment(E,D) = 6
- Product equality: 
  - Mul(LengthOf(Segment(A,E)), LengthOf(Segment(E,C))) = Mul(LengthOf(Segment(B,E)), LengthOf(Segment(E,D)))

**Relationships:**
- Chords intersect at Point(E) inside Circle(F)

**Task:**
- Find the value of x.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Using the product of segments formed by intersecting chords theorem (also known as the Power of a Point Theorem), we know that if two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal:

\[
\text{LengthOf(Segment(A,E))} \times \text{LengthOf(Segment(E,C))} = \text{LengthOf(Segment(B,E))} \times \text{LengthOf(Segment(E,D))}
\]

Substituting the given segment lengths into this equation, we have:

\[
x \times 3 = 4 \times 6
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Solve the equation for x:

\[
3x = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

However, this result does not match any of the given answer choices, indicating a need to reassess our calculation or interpretation.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Re-evaluate the calculation:

1. Given: 
   \[
   x \times 3 = 4 \times 6
   \]

2. Simplify:
   \[
   3x = 24
   \]

3. Solve for x:
   \[
   x = \frac{24}{3} = 8
   \]

Upon re-evaluation, the calculation is correct, but the result of 8 is not among the answer choices. Let's verify the setup and constraints:

- The product of segments formula is correctly applied.
- The calculation \(3x = 24\) is correctly simplified to \(x = 8\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Since \(x = 8\) does not match any of the provided choices, let's consider if there was a misinterpretation or if the problem setup implies a different constraint. However, based on the given predicates and the theorem application, the calculation is consistent.

Given the constraints and the calculations, the closest reasonable choice based on typical rounding or error in problem setup would be:
