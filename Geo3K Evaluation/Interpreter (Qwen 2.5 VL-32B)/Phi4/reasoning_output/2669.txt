To solve the problem, let's systematically analyze the given geometric predicates and apply relevant theorems and properties.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Points: D, E, F, A
- Lines: DE, EF, AF

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- RightAngle(Angle(A,F,E)): ∠AFE is a right angle (90 degrees).

**Relationships:**
- Parallel(Line(D,E), Line(E,F)): DE is parallel to EF.
- Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(D,E)): AF is perpendicular to DE.
- Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(E,F)): AF is perpendicular to EF.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

From the predicates, we can deduce the following:
- Since ∠AFE is a right angle and AF is perpendicular to both DE and EF, DE and EF must form a straight line at point E.
- DE is parallel to EF, and AF is perpendicular to both, implying DE and EF are part of the same straight line, making DE and EF collinear.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given the collinearity and perpendicularity conditions, we need to determine the angle x formed by these lines and points. The key is to understand the geometric configuration:

- Since DE and EF are collinear and parallel, they form a straight line.
- AF is perpendicular to this line at point F.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify the Angle:**
   - The angle ∠AFE is given as a right angle (90 degrees).

2. **Understand the Configuration:**
   - Since DE and EF are collinear, they form a straight line, and AF is perpendicular to this line at F.
   - Therefore, the angle between AF and the line DE (or EF) is 90 degrees.

3. **Determine x:**
   - The angle x in question is the angle formed by AF with the line DE (or EF), which is ∠AFE.
   - Since ∠AFE is a right angle, x = 90 degrees.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated angle x is 90 degrees, which matches one of the answer choices.
- Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
