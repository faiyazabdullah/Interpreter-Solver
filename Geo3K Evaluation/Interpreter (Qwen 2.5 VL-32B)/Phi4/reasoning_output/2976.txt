PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we will systematically analyze the provided geometric predicates and apply relevant geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Lines:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, A-E

**Angles:**
- \(\angle GCB\)
- \(\angle DBC\)
- \(\angle EAB\)
- \(\angle 1\)
- \(\angle 2\)
- \(\angle 3\)

**Relationships:**
- \(\text{IsLinearPair}(\angle 1, \angle 2)\)
- \(\text{IsLinearPair}(\angle 2, \angle 3)\)

**Positioning:**
- Points lie on respective lines as described.

**Task:**
Find the measure of \(\angle 2\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are a linear pair, so \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ\).
- \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 3\) are a linear pair, so \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\).

From these relationships, we can deduce:
- \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ\)
- \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\)

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given that \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ\) and \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\), we can infer that \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\). This is because both \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are supplementary to \(\angle 2\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. From \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle 2
   \]

2. From \(\angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   \angle 3 = 180^\circ - \angle 2
   \]

3. Since \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\), we equate the expressions:
   \[
   180^\circ - \angle 2 = 180^\circ - \angle 2
   \]

This confirms that \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\), but it doesn't directly give us \(\angle 2\). However, since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are equal, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point B (or any point where lines intersect) is \(360^\circ\).

4. Consider the angles around point B:
   - \(\angle GCB\), \(\angle DBC\), \(\angle EAB\), \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), and \(\angle 3\) are involved.
   - Since \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\), and they are both supplementary to \(\angle 2\), we can focus on the configuration of lines A-B-C-D-E.

5. Assume a configuration where \(\angle GCB\) and \(\angle DBC\) are part of a straight line, making \(\angle GCB + \angle DBC = 180^\circ\).

6. Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are equal and supplementary to \(\angle 2\), and given the symmetry and linearity, a reasonable assumption is that \(\angle 2\) is the angle that divides the supplementary angles equally.

7. If \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\), and both are supplementary to \(\angle 2\), then \(\angle 2\) must be the average of the remaining angles that sum to \(360^\circ\) minus the known angles.

8. Assume \(\angle GCB = \angle DBC = 90^\circ\) (as a reasonable geometric configuration), then:
   \[
   \angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   2\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]

9. Solving for \(\angle 2\) when \(\angle 1 = \angle 3\):
   \[
   2(180^\circ - \angle 2) + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   360^\circ - 2\angle 2 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   360^\circ - \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]

10. Re-evaluate based on typical angle measures and symmetry:
    - Given typical angle measures and symmetry, \(\angle 2\) is often a common angle measure that divides supplementary angles equally.

11. Assume \(\angle 1 = \angle 3 = 90^\circ\) (as a typical configuration), then:
    \[
    \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ
    \]

12. However, given the choices, and typical configurations, \(\angle 2\) is often a specific measure that fits the symmetry:
    - Assume \(\angle 1 = \angle 3 = 115^\circ\) (a typical configuration for supplementary angles):
    \[
    \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 115^\circ = 65^\circ
    \]

13. Re-evaluate based on choices:
    - If \(\angle 1 = \angle 3 = 97^\circ\) (a typical configuration):
    \[
    \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 97^\circ = 83^\circ
    \]

14. Given the choices, the closest typical configuration for \(\angle 2\) is:
    - \(\angle 2 = 55^\circ\) (a common angle measure in such configurations).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Given the typical configurations and the choices provided, the measure of \(\angle 2\) that fits the symmetry and typical angle measures is:
