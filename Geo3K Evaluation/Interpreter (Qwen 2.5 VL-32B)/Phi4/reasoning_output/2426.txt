PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the task. The goal is to determine the value of \( x \), the width of Rectangle \( EFGH \), given that the rectangles \( ABCD \) and \( EFGH \) are similar, and we have the areas and width of \( ABCD \).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Two rectangles: \( ABCD \) and \( EFGH \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Area of \( ABCD \) is 8.
- Area of \( EFGH \) is 32.
- Width of \( ABCD \) is 4.
- Width of \( EFGH \) is \( x \).

**Relationships:**
- Rectangles \( ABCD \) and \( EFGH \) are similar.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- We need to find the width \( x \) of \( EFGH \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \( ABCD \) and \( EFGH \) are similar, their corresponding side lengths are proportional.
- The ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- For similar rectangles, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

**Plan:**
1. Use the area ratio to find the side length ratio.
2. Use the side length ratio to find the width \( x \) of \( EFGH \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Calculate the area ratio:**
   \[
   \text{Area ratio} = \frac{\text{Area of } EFGH}{\text{Area of } ABCD} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

2. **Find the side length ratio:**
   Since the area ratio is the square of the side length ratio:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\text{Side length of } EFGH}{\text{Side length of } ABCD}\right)^2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\text{Side length of } EFGH}{\text{Side length of } ABCD} = \sqrt{4} = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the width \( x \) of \( EFGH \):**
   Since the width of \( ABCD \) is 4, and the side length ratio is 2:
   \[
   x = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated width \( x \) is 8.
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 1, B. 2, C. 8, D. 16.
- The correct choice is C.

Final Answer: C
