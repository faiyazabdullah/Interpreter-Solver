Let's solve the problem using the given predicates and the information provided.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP
- **Geometric Shapes**:
  - Circle with center \( G \)
  - Points: \( F, E, H, J, A, B, G \)
  - Lines: \( FE, EB, BH, HJ, JF, GA, GB, GH, GJ, GF \)

- **Measurements and Equalities**:
  - \( m \angle 2 = 2x \)
  - \( m \angle 3 = x \)

- **Positioning and Relationships**:
  - Lines \( FE, EB, BH, HJ, JF \) form a closed figure with points \( F, E, B, H, J \).
  - Lines \( GA, GB, GH, GJ, GF \) connect center \( G \) to points on the circle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS
- The lines \( FE, EB, BH, HJ, JF \) form a closed pentagon.
- Since \( G \) is the center of the circle and lines \( GA, GB, GH, GJ, GF \) are drawn, these lines are radii of the circle.
- The angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are related by \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY
- Recognize that \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are likely related to the geometry involving the circle and the lines through the center \( G \).
- Consider the possibility of these angles being inscribed angles or central angles.
- Since \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \), \( \angle 2 \) is twice \( \angle 3 \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION
- Since \( \angle 2 \) is twice \( \angle 3 \), and they are related to a circle with center \( G \), consider the possibility of these angles being part of a triangle or other geometric figure involving the circle.
- If \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are inscribed angles that subtend arcs, then the arc subtended by \( \angle 2 \) is twice that of \( \angle 3 \).
- Consider the sum of angles around point \( G \) or within a triangle involving \( G \).

- If \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are part of a triangle involving the center \( G \), such as a triangle \( \triangle GEF \) or similar, the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

- Assume \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are part of a triangle \( \triangle GEF \) where \( \angle GEF = \angle 2 \) and \( \angle GFE = \angle 3 \).

- The third angle \( \angle EGF \) in \( \triangle GEF \) would be \( 180^\circ - (2x + x) = 180^\circ - 3x \).

- Since \( G \) is the center, \( \angle EGF \) could be a central angle, and the sum of angles around point \( G \) is \( 360^\circ \).

- If \( \angle EGF \) is a central angle, and considering symmetry or equal division by radii, \( 3x \) could be a significant fraction of \( 360^\circ \).

- Assume \( 3x = 90^\circ \) (since \( 360^\circ/4 = 90^\circ \) is a common division for symmetry in circles).

- Solving \( 3x = 90^\circ \) gives \( x = 30^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION
- Verify: If \( x = 30^\circ \), then \( m \angle 3 = 30^\circ \) and \( m \angle 2 = 60^\circ \).
- Check if this satisfies the conditions: \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \).
- Both conditions are satisfied with \( x = 30^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 3 \) is \( 30^\circ \).
