Let's solve the given geometric problem step-by-step using the provided predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

We are given:
- A triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
- Lines \( AB, BC, \) and \( AC \).
- Lengths: \( AB = 2x + 11 \) and \( AC = 6x - 9 \).
- The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles.
- Lines \( AB \) and \( AC \) are congruent (equal in length).

**Objective:**
Find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

From the predicates:
1. \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, meaning at least two sides are equal.
2. \( AB \) and \( AC \) are congruent.

Since \( AB \) and \( AC \) are congruent, we have:
\[ 2x + 11 = 6x - 9 \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \( x \), solve the equation derived from the congruence of \( AB \) and \( AC \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 11 = 6x - 9 \]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[ 11 = 4x - 9 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 20 = 4x \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 5 \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify the solution:
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for \( AB \) and \( AC \):
  - \( AB = 2(5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21 \)
  - \( AC = 6(5) - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21 \)

Both lengths are equal, confirming that \( AB = AC \), which satisfies the condition of congruence and the isosceles nature of the triangle.

The calculated value \( x = 5 \) matches one of the answer choices.

Final Answer: B
