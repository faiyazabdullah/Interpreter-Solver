PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( E \) with points \( A, B, C, D \) on it.
- Points \( A, B, C \) form an angle \( \angle ABC \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 70^\circ \).
- \( \text{SumOf}(x, y) = 360^\circ \) (where \( x \) and \( y \) are measures of arcs \( \widehat{AC} \) and \( \widehat{ADC} \)).
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = \text{HalfOf}(\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Arc}(A,C))) \).

**Positioning:**
- \( A, B, C, D \) lie on circle \( E \).

**Goal:**
- Find \( x = \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Arc}(A,C)) \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- From the predicate \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = \text{HalfOf}(\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Arc}(A,C))) \), we have:
  \[
  70^\circ = \frac{x}{2}
  \]
  Solving for \( x \), we get:
  \[
  x = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
  \]

- Given \( \text{SumOf}(x, y) = 360^\circ \), we have:
  \[
  x + y = 360^\circ
  \]
  Substituting \( x = 140^\circ \), we find:
  \[
  140^\circ + y = 360^\circ
  \]
  \[
  y = 360^\circ - 140^\circ = 220^\circ
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We have determined \( x = 140^\circ \) directly from the relationship between the inscribed angle \( \angle ABC \) and the arc \( \widehat{AC} \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- The calculation \( x = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ \) is consistent with the given predicates and geometric properties.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated \( x = 140^\circ \) does not match any of the answer choices directly. However, we need to identify the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \).
- Since \( x = 140^\circ \) is the measure of the arc corresponding to the inscribed angle \( \angle ABC \), and given the options, the closest reasonable choice is \( 140^\circ \) being the major arc, implying the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is \( 360^\circ - 140^\circ = 220^\circ \).

- Re-evaluating the context, the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) should be \( 140^\circ \) as calculated, but the choices suggest a different interpretation:
  - \( x = 140^\circ \) is the major arc measure, so the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is \( 360^\circ - 140^\circ = 220^\circ \).
  - However, the inscribed angle directly gives the minor arc measure, so \( x = 140^\circ \) is indeed the minor arc measure.

- Given the choices, the closest logical interpretation is that the problem expects the minor arc measure directly from the inscribed angle calculation, which is \( 140^\circ \).

Thus, the correct answer choice based on the interpretation of the problem and the given options is:
