PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric predicates and determine the measure of angle \(\angle 2\).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: \(A, B, C, D\)
- Lines: \(AB, BC, CA, BD, DA\)
- Circle: \(O\) with points \(A, B, C, D\) lying on it
- Triangle: \(ABC\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Measure of \(\angle BDA\) is given but not specified.

**Relationships:**
- \(AB, BD, DA\) are chords of circle \(O\).
- \(A, B, C, D\) lie on circle \(O\).

**Positioning:**
- Points \(A, B, C, D\) are on the circumference of circle \(O\).

**Special Constructions/Theorems:**
- Since \(A, B, C, D\) lie on circle \(O\), they form a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
- Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, \(\angle BDA\) and \(\angle BCA\) are supplementary.
- \(\angle BDA + \angle BCA = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find \(m \angle 2\), which is \(\angle BDA\).
- Use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals: opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\).
- \(\angle BDA\) and \(\angle BCA\) are supplementary.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Since \(\angle BDA\) and \(\angle BCA\) are supplementary:
   \[
   \angle BDA + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
   \]

2. In \(\triangle ABC\), since \(A, B, C\) lie on the circle, \(\angle BAC\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(BC\).

3. \(\angle BCA\) is also an inscribed angle subtending arc \(BA\).

4. Since \(ABCD\) is cyclic, \(\angle BDA\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(CA\).

5. If \(\angle BDA\) is given as \(\theta\), then \(\angle BCA = 180^\circ - \theta\).

6. Since \(\angle BDA\) and \(\angle BCA\) are supplementary, and \(\angle BCA\) is an inscribed angle, we can infer:
   \[
   \angle BDA = \angle BCA
   \]

7. If \(\angle BDA = \angle BCA\), then:
   \[
   2\angle BDA = 180^\circ \implies \angle BDA = 90^\circ
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The measure of \(\angle BDA\) is \(90^\circ\).
- This matches choice D.
