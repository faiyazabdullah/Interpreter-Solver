To solve this geometric problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
- Circle \(X\)
- Points \(A, B, C, D, M, N\)
- Lines: \(AB\), \(CD\), \(AM\), \(BM\), \(CM\), \(DM\), \(CN\), \(ND\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Lengths: \(AB = 30\), \(CD = 30\)
- Right angles: \(\angle AMB\) and \(\angle CMD\)
- Midpoints: \(M\) is the midpoint of both \(AB\) and \(CD\)

**Relationships:**
- \(M\) is the intersection of \(AB\) and \(CD\)
- \(M\) has equal power with respect to circle \(X\) using lines \(AB\) and \(CD\)

**Objective:**
- Find the length \(ND\) given \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- \(M\) is the midpoint of \(AB\) and \(CD\), so \(AM = MB = 15\) and \(CM = MD = 15\).
- Right angles at \(M\) imply right triangles \(\triangle AMB\) and \(\triangle CMD\).
- The power of point \(M\) with respect to circle \(X\) implies \(MA \cdot MB = MC \cdot MD\). Given \(MA = MB = 15\) and \(MC = MD = 15\), this condition is satisfied.
- \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\) suggests a relationship involving angles in the circle, potentially involving inscribed angles or central angles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the fact that \(M\) is the midpoint and the right angles to establish relationships in triangles.
- Consider the circle properties and angle \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\) to find relationships involving \(N\).
- Use the power of point \(M\) and the circle properties to find \(ND\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Right Triangles:**
   - \(\triangle AMB\) and \(\triangle CMD\) are right triangles with \(AM = MB = 15\) and \(CM = MD = 15\).

2. **Circle Properties:**
   - Since \(M\) is the midpoint and the power of point \(M\) is equal for both chords, the circle's symmetry and chord properties can be used.

3. **Angle \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\):**
   - This angle suggests an inscribed angle or central angle property. If \(Z\) is a point on the circle such that \(\angle CZD = 40^\circ\), then the arc \(CD\) subtended by \(\angle CZD\) is \(80^\circ\) (since inscribed angle is half the arc).

4. **Finding \(ND\):**
   - Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(CD\), and \(CN\) and \(ND\) are parts of the chord \(CD\), use symmetry and the circle's properties.
   - The angle \(\angle CZD = 40^\circ\) implies that \(N\) divides \(CD\) such that \(\triangle CNZ\) and \(\triangle NDZ\) are related by symmetry.
   - Given \(CD = 30\), and using the symmetry and angle properties, \(CN = ND\).

5. **Calculate \(ND\):**
   - Since \(CN = ND\) and \(CD = 30\), it follows that \(CN = ND = 15\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculations and geometric reasoning confirm that \(ND = 15\).
- Compare with answer choices: A. 10, B. 15, C. 20, D. 30.
- The correct answer is \(ND = 15\).

Final Answer: B
