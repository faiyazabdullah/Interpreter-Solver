====================================================================================================
To solve the given geometric problem, we need to apply the given predicates and geometric principles systematically.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Entities:**
- Circle \( Z \)
- Points \( W, X, Y, Z \) (Note: \( Z \) is both a point and part of a circle, but contextually it's treated as the circle itself.)
- Lines \( WX \) and \( XY \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{Tangent}(WX, \text{Circle}(Z)) \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(WX) = 2x + 9 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(XY) = 3x + 6 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( WX \) is tangent to circle \( Z \).

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

From the predicates, we know:
- The line \( WX \) is tangent to circle \( Z \) at point \( X \).
- A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, \( ZX \) (radius) is perpendicular to \( WX \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Using the properties of tangents and circles:
- Since \( WX \) is tangent at \( X \), and \( ZX \) is the radius, \( ZX \perp WX \).
- By the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle ZWX \):
  \[
  ZW^2 = ZX^2 + WX^2
  \]
- We need to express \( ZW \) and \( ZX \) in terms of \( x \) to find a relation.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Since \( ZX \) is a radius, and \( WX \) is tangent, we use the Pythagorean theorem:
- Let \( r \) be the radius \( ZX \).
- \( ZW \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle ZWX \).

The equation becomes:
\[
ZW^2 = r^2 + (2x + 9)^2
\]

However, we don't have \( ZW \) or \( r \) directly. Instead, we use the fact that \( XY \) is a continuation and not directly involved in the tangent property.

Given:
- \( \text{LengthOf}(WX) = 2x + 9 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(XY) = 3x + 6 \)

Since \( WX \) is tangent, and no other lengths or angles are provided, we assume \( XY \) doesn't affect the tangent condition directly. The problem implies a geometric constraint where \( WX \) being tangent gives a unique solution for \( x \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

To find \( x \), consider:
- The tangent property implies a unique geometric configuration.
- The lengths \( 2x + 9 \) and \( 3x + 6 \) suggest a relationship where \( WX \) and \( XY \) might be part of a larger geometric figure, but only \( WX \) is relevant for the tangent condition.

Assume:
- \( WX \) and \( XY \) form a straight line or part of a geometric figure where \( XY \) doesn't affect the tangent condition.
- Equate the expressions derived from the tangent condition.

Since no additional geometric constraints are given, assume:
- \( 2x + 9 = 3x + 6 \) (a potential equality derived from similar or congruent segments)

Solve for \( x \):
\[
2x + 9 = 3x + 6
\]
\[
9 - 6 = 3x - 2x
\]
\[
3 = x
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 3 \).
