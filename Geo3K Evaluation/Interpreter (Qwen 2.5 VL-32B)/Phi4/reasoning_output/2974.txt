Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- We have a rhombus \(PQRS\) with points \(P, Q, R, S\).
- There is a circle \(C\) circumscribed around the rhombus.
- Points \(P, Q, R, S\) lie on the circle.

**Lines and Midpoints:**
- Diagonals \(PR\) and \(QS\) intersect at point \(C\), the center of the circle.
- \(C\) is the midpoint of both \(PR\) and \(QS\).

**Relationships and Properties:**
- The diagonals \(PR\) and \(QS\) are perpendicular.
- All sides of the rhombus are congruent: \(PQ = QR = RS = SP\).
- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

**Task:**
- Find the measure of \(\angle SPQ\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \(PQRS\) is a rhombus, diagonals \(PR\) and \(QS\) bisect each other at right angles.
- \(C\) is the center of the circle and the midpoint of both diagonals.
- The diagonals of a rhombus inscribed in a circle are also the diameters of the circle.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- In a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (Thales' theorem).
- Since \(PR\) and \(QS\) are diameters, \(\angle PSQ\) and \(\angle PRQ\) are right angles.
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles of the rhombus.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Diagonals as Diameters:**
   - Since \(PR\) and \(QS\) are diameters, \(\angle PSQ = 90^\circ\).

2. **Bisecting Angles:**
   - The diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.
   - Therefore, \(\angle SPQ = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle PSQ = \frac{1}{2} \times 90^\circ = 45^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of \(\angle SPQ\) is \(45^\circ\).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90.
- The correct choice is \(45^\circ\).
