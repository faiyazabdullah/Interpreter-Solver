Let's approach the problem systematically:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Points: A, B, W, F
  - Lines: A-B, B-W, A-W, W-W (degenerate line), F-W
  - Rectangle: A-B-W
  - Right Angle: At B with Angle(B, A, W)

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - Length of Line W-W is 8.
  - Length of Line F-W is 12.
  - Length of Line F-W equals the sum of x and 8, i.e., Length(F-W) = x + 8.

- **Relationships:**
  - Right angle at B implies A-B-W forms a right triangle with a right angle at B.
  - Rectangle A-B-W implies A-B is perpendicular to B-W.

- **What to Find:**
  - The scale factor from W to W'.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS
- Since Line(W-W) has a length of 8, it suggests W-W is a degenerate line (point W with itself), implying W is a fixed point.
- Length(F-W) = 12, and Length(F-W) = x + 8, so:
  \[
  x + 8 = 12 \implies x = 4
  \]
- The rectangle A-B-W implies A, B, and W form a right triangle with AB perpendicular to BW.
- The problem asks for the scale factor from W to W'. We interpret W' as a scaled version of W in some context. Given the length constraints, W' could be a point such that W-W' is a scaled version of another segment involving W.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY
- We need to determine the scale factor between W and W'. Since W-W is 8, and we have a segment F-W of length 12, we can consider the scaling of F-W.
- The equation Length(F-W) = x + 8 gives us x = 4. This suggests a relationship between F-W and W-W.
- The scale factor could be derived from the ratio of these lengths.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION
- The segment F-W is 12, and W-W is 8.
- The scale factor from W to W' (interpreted as scaling F-W to W-W) is:
  \[
  \text{Scale factor} = \frac{\text{Length of W-W}}{\text{Length of F-W}} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION
- The calculated scale factor \(\frac{2}{3}\) matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Verify: The interpretation of W' as a scaled version of F-W to W-W is consistent with the given lengths and the derived scale factor.
