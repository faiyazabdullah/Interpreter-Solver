PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**:
  - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) formed by points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The lines \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{BC} \), and \( \overline{CA} \) form the sides of this triangle.

- **Measurements and Equalities**:
  - The angles within the triangle are \( \angle C, A, B \), \( \angle B, C, A \), and \( \angle A, B, C \).
  - Measure of \( \angle C, A, B \) is given as 52 degrees.
  - Measure of \( \angle B, C, A \) is given as 35 degrees.
  - Measure of \( \angle A, B, C \) is represented as \( x \).

- **Relationships**:
  - The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

- **Objective**:
  - We are tasked to find the measure of \( \angle A, B, C \), denoted as \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Using the sum of angles in a triangle:
  \[
  \text{SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)), MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)), 180)}
  \]
  This can be written as:
  \[
  x + 35 + 52 = 180
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- To find \( x \), we will solve the equation derived from the sum of angles in a triangle:
  \[
  x + 35 + 52 = 180
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Simplify and solve the equation:
  \[
  x + 35 + 52 = 180
  \]
  \[
  x + 87 = 180
  \]
  \[
  x = 180 - 87
  \]
  \[
  x = 93
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We have calculated \( x = 93 \).
- Verify that this makes sense: \( 93 + 35 + 52 = 180 \), which is correct.
- Compare with the answer choices:
  - A. 35
  - B. 52
  - C. 77
  - D. 93

- The calculated value \( x = 93 \) matches choice D.

Final Answer: D
