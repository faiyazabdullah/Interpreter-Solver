Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( C \)
- Points: \( R, S, Q, T, A \)

**Lines and Arcs:**
- Line \( RS \)
- Line \( QT \)
- Arc \( RS \)
- Arc \( QT \)

**Angles and Measurements:**
- Angle \( \angle QAR \) with measure 32 degrees.

**Positioning:**
- Points \( R \) and \( S \) are on line \( RS \).
- Points \( Q \) and \( T \) are on line \( QT \).

**Objective:**
- Find \( m \angle S \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( \angle QAR = 32^\circ \), and points \( R, S \) lie on a line, we need to explore the implications of these points being on a circle.
- The arcs \( RS \) and \( QT \) suggest that \( R, S, Q, T \) are on the circle \( C \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the inscribed angle theorem: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Since \( \angle QAR = 32^\circ \), it is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( QR \).
- Therefore, arc \( QR \) measures \( 2 \times 32^\circ = 64^\circ \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem Application:**
   - \( \angle QAR = 32^\circ \) intercepts arc \( QR \).
   - Measure of arc \( QR = 2 \times 32^\circ = 64^\circ \).

2. **Circle Properties:**
   - The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
   - Arc \( RS \) and arc \( QT \) are parts of the circle.

3. **Finding \( m \angle S \):**
   - Since \( R, S, Q, T \) are on the circle, \( \angle S \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( QT \).
   - Arc \( QT \) is the remainder of the circle after subtracting arc \( QR \) and arc \( RS \).
   - Assume \( RS \) is the arc opposite \( QT \) (since \( R, S \) are on line \( RS \)), then arc \( RS = 180^\circ - 64^\circ = 116^\circ \).

4. **Calculate Arc \( QT \):**
   - \( \text{Arc } QT = 360^\circ - \text{Arc } QR - \text{Arc } RS \)
   - \( \text{Arc } QT = 360^\circ - 64^\circ - 116^\circ = 180^\circ \).

5. **Inscribed Angle \( \angle S \):**
   - \( \angle S \) intercepts arc \( QT \).
   - \( m \angle S = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc } QT = \frac{1}{2} \times 180^\circ = 90^\circ \).

However, since \( \angle S \) is not directly given as an inscribed angle, we need to consider the configuration:
- If \( \angle S \) is an angle formed by line \( RS \) and the tangent at \( S \), then it is supplementary to the inscribed angle intercepting the opposite arc.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Since \( \angle S \) is supplementary to \( \angle QAR \) (as they form a linear pair on the circle), we have:
  \[
  m \angle S = 180^\circ - 32^\circ = 148^\circ
  \]
- However, this doesn't match any choices, indicating a misinterpretation. Let's reconsider:
- \( \angle S \) is actually the angle formed by the line \( RS \) and the tangent at \( S \), which is equal to the inscribed angle \( \angle QAR \) due to the alternate segment theorem.

Thus, \( m \angle S = 32^\circ \).
