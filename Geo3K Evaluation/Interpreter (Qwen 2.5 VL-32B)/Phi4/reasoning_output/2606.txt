PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's go through the given problem step-by-step using the provided predicates.

**STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP**

We have a pentagon \(ABCDE\) with points \(A, B, C, D, E\). The angles given are:

- \(\angle ABC\)
- \(\angle BCD\)
- \(\angle CDE\)
- \(\angle DEA\)
- \(\angle EAB\)

The predicates provide us with the following information:
- \(\angle BCD\) and \(\angle CDE\) are right angles, each measuring \(90^\circ\).
- \(\angle BCD = x\).
- \(\angle CDE = x + 24\).
- \(\angle DEA = 115^\circ\).
- \(\angle EAB = 2y - 56\).
- The sum of all interior angles of a pentagon is \(540^\circ\).

**STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS**

Using the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:
\[
\angle ABC + \angle BCD + \angle CDE + \angle DEA + \angle EAB = 540
\]

Substitute the known angle measures:
\[
\angle ABC + x + (x + 24) + 115 + (2y - 56) = 540
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
\angle ABC + 2x + 24 + 115 + 2y - 56 = 540
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\angle ABC + 2x + 2y + 83 = 540
\]

Subtract 83 from both sides:
\[
\angle ABC + 2x + 2y = 457
\]

**STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY**

We know:
- \(\angle BCD = x = 90\)
- \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 90\)

From \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 90\), we can solve for \(x\):
\[
x + 24 = 90
\]
\[
x = 90 - 24
\]
\[
x = 66
\]

**STEP 4: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION**

Let's verify if \(x = 66\) satisfies all conditions:
- \(\angle BCD = x = 66\)
- \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 66 + 24 = 90\)

Both conditions are satisfied. Now, let's check if this value fits within the sum of the angles:
\[
\angle ABC + 2(66) + 2y + 83 = 540
\]
\[
\angle ABC + 132 + 2y + 83 = 540
\]
\[
\angle ABC + 2y + 215 = 540
\]
\[
\angle ABC + 2y = 325
\]

This equation is consistent with the given conditions, and \(x = 66\) is not among the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate:

Reconsider \(\angle BCD = x = 90\):
- \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 90\)

From \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 90\), solve for \(x\):
\[
x + 24 = 90
\]
\[
x = 66
\]

Re-evaluate the choices:
- \(x = 66\) is not an option.
- Recheck calculations:
  - \(\angle BCD = x = 90\)
  - \(\angle CDE = x + 24 = 90\)

Re-evaluate:
\[
x + 24 = 90 \Rightarrow x = 66
\]
