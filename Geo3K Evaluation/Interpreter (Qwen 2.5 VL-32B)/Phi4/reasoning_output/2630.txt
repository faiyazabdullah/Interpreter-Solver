To solve the problem, let's systematically work through the given predicates and apply geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Lines: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, BF
- Triangles: △ABC, △EBD
- Angles: ∠ABC, ∠ABF, ∠FBC, ∠EFD
- Right Angles: ∠AFB, ∠EFD

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Lengths: AB = 6, BC = 7.5, AC = 9, DE = 9
- Similarity: △ABC ∼ △EBD

**Relationships:**
- Parallel lines: AC ∥ ED
- Bisects: BF bisects ∠ABC
- Right angles: ∠AFB and ∠EFD are right angles

**Objective:**
Find the length of BD.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

1. **Parallel Lines and Similar Triangles:**
   - Since AC ∥ ED and BF bisects ∠ABC, triangles △ABC and △EBD are similar by AA similarity (corresponding angles are equal).

2. **Right Angles:**
   - ∠AFB and ∠EFD are right angles, which implies that triangles △AFB and △EFD are right triangles.

3. **Bisecting Angle:**
   - BF bisects ∠ABC, so ∠ABF = ∠FBC.

4. **Using Similarity:**
   - Since △ABC ∼ △EBD, the corresponding sides are proportional:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{EB} = \frac{BC}{BD} = \frac{AC}{ED}
     \]

5. **Known Lengths:**
   - AC = 9, DE = 9, AB = 6, BC = 7.5

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Using the similarity of triangles, we can set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{AC}{ED} = \frac{9}{9} = 1
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{AB}{EB} = \frac{BC}{BD} = 1
\]

From \(\frac{AB}{EB} = 1\), we have \(AB = EB = 6\).

From \(\frac{BC}{BD} = 1\), we have \(BC = BD = 7.5\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Using the similarity ratio:
- Since \(\frac{BC}{BD} = 1\), it follows directly that \(BD = BC = 7.5\).

However, we need to consider the entire configuration:
- Since BF bisects ∠ABC and AC ∥ ED, the triangles are not only similar but also symmetric in terms of the parallel lines and bisected angles.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Given the symmetry and the parallel lines, the configuration implies that the triangles are scaled versions of each other. Since \(AC = ED\) and the triangles are similar with a ratio of 1, the length \(BD\) must be twice the length of \(BC\) due to the parallel and bisecting nature of the setup.

Thus, \(BD = 2 \times BC = 2 \times 7.5 = 15\).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
