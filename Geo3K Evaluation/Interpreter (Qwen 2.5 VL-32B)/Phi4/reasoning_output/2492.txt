====================================================================================================
To solve this geometric problem, we will follow the structured step-by-step approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle(Circle1)
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Lines: AB, CF, DF (noted twice, but it confirms the line)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Right angles: \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle DCF\)
- Congruent lines: \(AB \cong DF\)
- Lengths: \(AB = 9x\), \(DF = 2x + 14\)

**Relationships:**
- Perpendicular lines creating right angles at \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle DCF\)
- Congruent lines \(AB\) and \(DF\)

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \(x\) given that \(AB \cong DF\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

The key relationship here is the congruence of lines \(AB\) and \(DF\). This gives us the equation:

\[ 9x = 2x + 14 \]

This equation arises from the fact that if two line segments are congruent, their lengths are equal.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \(x\), we will solve the equation derived from the congruence of line segments.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Start with the equation from the congruence:
   \[
   9x = 2x + 14
   \]

2. Subtract \(2x\) from both sides to isolate terms involving \(x\):
   \[
   9x - 2x = 14
   \]

3. Simplify the left side:
   \[
   7x = 14
   \]

4. Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{14}{7} = 2
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify the solution:
- Substitute \(x = 2\) back into the expressions for the lengths of \(AB\) and \(DF\):
  - \(AB = 9x = 9(2) = 18\)
  - \(DF = 2x + 14 = 2(2) + 14 = 4 + 14 = 18\)

Both lengths are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

The calculated value of \(x\) matches one of the provided answer choices.
