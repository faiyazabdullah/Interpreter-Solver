PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle ABC\) using the given predicates and geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
   - Points: \(A, B, C, G\)
   - Lines: \(\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CG}\)
   - Triangle: \(\triangle ABC\)

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle BAC) = 38^\circ\)
   - \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle BCA) = 33^\circ\)
   - \(\text{SumOf}(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle BAC), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BCA), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC)) = 180^\circ\)

3. **Relationships:**
   - \(\overline{l} \parallel \overline{m}\)
   - \(\angle ABC\) is intersected by \(\overline{l}\) and \(\overline{m}\)

4. **Special Constructions/Theorems:**
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- We know the measures of two angles in \(\triangle ABC\):
  - \(\angle BAC = 38^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BCA = 33^\circ\)

- Using the triangle angle sum property:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BAC) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BCA) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 180^\circ
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Substitute the known angle measures into the equation:
  \[
  38^\circ + 33^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 180^\circ
  \]

- Solve for \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC)\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Calculate:
  \[
  38^\circ + 33^\circ = 71^\circ
  \]

- Substitute back into the equation:
  \[
  71^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 180^\circ
  \]

- Solve for \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC)\):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 180^\circ - 71^\circ = 109^\circ
  \]

- Since \(\angle ABC\) is intersected by parallel lines \(\overline{l}\) and \(\overline{m}\), we need to consider the alternate interior angles or corresponding angles. However, the problem asks directly for the measure of \(\angle ABC\) itself, not an angle formed by the intersection.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify:
  - The calculation of \(\angle ABC\) as \(109^\circ\) is correct based on the triangle angle sum.
  - The problem asks for \(\angle ABC\) itself, not an angle related to the parallel lines.

- Compare with answer choices:
  - A. 33
  - B. 38
  - C. 61
  - D. 71

- The calculated measure \(109^\circ\) does not match any choice directly. However, the problem might be asking for the supplementary angle due to parallel lines, which would be \(180^\circ - 109^\circ = 71^\circ\).
