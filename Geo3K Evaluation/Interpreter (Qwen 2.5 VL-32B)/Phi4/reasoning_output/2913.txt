Let's solve the problem using the given predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(A, B, C, D\).
  - Right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(AB) = 14 \)
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(BC) = 10 \)
  - \( \text{LengthOf}(CD) = x \)

- **Relationships:**
  - \( \text{Perpendicular}(AB, BC) \) implies \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle.
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular, forming a right triangle with hypotenuse \( AC \).

- **Positioning:**
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB \) and \( BC \) as the legs, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AC \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Calculate \( AC \) using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   AC^2 = 14^2 + 10^2 = 196 + 100 = 296
   \]
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{296} = \sqrt{4 \times 74} = 2\sqrt{74}
   \]

2. Since \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle and \( BD \) is a diagonal, \( BD \) is not directly involved in the calculation of \( x \). However, we need to find \( CD \) using the properties of the quadrilateral and the right triangle.

3. Recognize that \( \triangle BCD \) is not directly a right triangle, but we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABD \) or \( \triangle BCD \) if needed.

4. Since \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \), and \( CD \) is a side of the quadrilateral, we need to find a relationship involving \( x \).

5. Use the fact that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle and \( AC = 2\sqrt{74} \).

6. Since \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \) share \( BD \), and \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle, consider the properties of the quadrilateral.

7. Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCD \) if \( BD \) is known or can be expressed in terms of known lengths.

8. Assume \( BD \) is the diagonal that can be expressed using \( AB \) and \( BC \) with the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   BD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 196 + 100 = 296
   \]
   \[
   BD = \sqrt{296} = 2\sqrt{74}
   \]

9. Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCD \):
   \[
   BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2
   \]
   \[
   (2\sqrt{74})^2 = 10^2 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   296 = 100 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 196
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{196} = 14
   \]
