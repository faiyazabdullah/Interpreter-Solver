QUESTION:
A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

CHOICES:
A. 53
B. 73.8
C. 110
D. 1591

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this geometric problem, we need to determine the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta given the total trip distance and the equations for each segment of the journey.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A, B, C \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A, B))} = 150x + 91 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(B, C))} = 110x + 53 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(C, A))} = 73.8x \)
- \( \text{SumOf(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), LengthOf(Line(B, C)), LengthOf(Line(C, A)))} = 3482 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line(A, B), Triangle(A, B, C))} \)
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line(B, C), Triangle(A, B, C))} \)
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line(C, A), Triangle(A, B, C))} \)

**Specific Value to Find:**
- Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which corresponds to \( \text{LengthOf(Line(B, C))} \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

We have the equation for the total perimeter of the triangle:
\[
(150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + (73.8x) = 3482
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
150x + 110x + 73.8x + 91 + 53 = 3482
\]

Simplify:
\[
333.8x + 144 = 3482
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Solve for \( x \) using the equation:
\[
333.8x + 144 = 3482
\]

Subtract 144 from both sides:
\[
333.8x = 3338
\]

Divide by 333.8:
\[
x = \frac{3338}{333.8} = 10
\]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Now, substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the expression for \( \text{LengthOf(Line(B, C))} \):
\[
\text{LengthOf(Line(B, C))} = 110x + 53 = 110(10) + 53 = 1100 + 53 = 1153
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1153 miles. However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices directly. We need to check our steps:

Re-evaluate the calculation:
- \( x = 10 \) is correct.
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(B, C))} = 110x + 53 = 1153 \).

The closest reasonable option to 1153 is not directly listed, but the calculation confirms the setup and solution process. The error lies in matching the calculated value to the closest answer choice.

Given the choices:
- A. 53
- B. 73.8
- C. 110
- D. 1591

The closest reasonable choice based on the setup and calculation is \( D. 1591 \), as it is the only option that could represent a plausible error or misinterpretation in the context of the problem setup.

Final Answer: D
