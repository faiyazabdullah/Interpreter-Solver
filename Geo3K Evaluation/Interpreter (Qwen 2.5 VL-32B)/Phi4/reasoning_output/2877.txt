Let's solve the problem step-by-step following the structured approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Hexagon(A, B, C, D, E, F) indicates a hexagon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- Regular(Hexagon(A, B, C, D, E, F)) tells us the hexagon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Point(E) and Point(G) are specific points.
- Line(E, G) is defined, with LengthOf(Line(E, G)) = 5.
- IsMidpointOf(Point(H), Line(E, G)) indicates H is the midpoint of EG.
- Line(H, E) is part of a circle with center H and radius equal to LengthOf(Line(H, E)) = 2.5.

**Positioning and Relationships:**
- Since H is the midpoint of EG, EH = HG = 2.5, consistent with the circle's radius.

**Objective:**
- We need to find the area of the regular hexagon.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- In a regular hexagon, all sides are equal.
- The distance from the center of a regular hexagon to any vertex (the circumradius) is equal to the side length.
- The distance from the center to the midpoint of any side (the apothem) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the side length.

**Given Information:**
- Since H is the midpoint of EG and LengthOf(Line(H, E)) = 2.5, EH = 2.5.
- In a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is the same as the side length.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- The side length of the hexagon is equal to the circumradius.
- The area \( A \) of a regular hexagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
  \[
  A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
  \]

**Plan:**
1. Determine the side length of the hexagon.
2. Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon to find the area.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Determine Side Length:**
   - Since H is the midpoint of EG and EH = 2.5, the full length EG = 5.
   - In a regular hexagon, the line from the center to a vertex is equal to the side length.
   - Since H is the midpoint and on the line from the center to a vertex, the side length \( s \) of the hexagon is 5.

2. **Calculate Area:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon:
   \[
   A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
   \]
   - Substitute \( s = 5 \):
   \[
   A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 5^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 25 = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]
   - Approximate \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
   \[
   A \approx \frac{75 \times 1.732}{2} = \frac{129.9}{2} = 64.95
   \]
   - Round to the nearest tenth: \( 65.0 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated area is approximately 65.0, which matches one of the answer choices.
