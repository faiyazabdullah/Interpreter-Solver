PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 2\). Given that \(\overline{AB} \perp \overline{BC}\), we have a right angle at \(\angle ABC\).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G\)
  - Lines: \(\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CD}, \overline{DE}, \overline{EF}, \overline{FG}, \overline{GC}\)

- **Angles:**
  - \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle.
  - \(\angle DAB = 36^\circ\)
  - \(\angle CEF = 40^\circ\)

- **Perpendicular Relationships:**
  - \(\overline{AB} \perp \overline{BC}\), meaning \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), we know that the angles around point \(B\) must sum to \(360^\circ\).
- We are given \(\angle DAB = 36^\circ\), which is not directly related to \(\angle ABC\) but is useful for understanding the configuration.
- We need to find \(\angle 2\), which is likely related to the angles around point \(C\) or \(B\).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), and \(\angle CEF = 40^\circ\), we need to consider the angles around point \(C\).
- The line \(\overline{GC}\) intersects \(\overline{BC}\) at \(C\), forming angles \(\angle BCG\) and \(\angle GCB\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 2\), which is likely \(\angle BCG\).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- At point \(C\), the angles \(\angle BCG\), \(\angle GCB\), and \(\angle ACB\) must sum to \(360^\circ\) because \(\overline{GC}\) is a line.
- Since \(\angle ACB\) is part of the right triangle \(\triangle ABC\), we have:
  \[
  \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \angle BAC
  \]
- We know \(\angle BAC\) is part of \(\angle DAB\) which is \(36^\circ\), but \(\angle BAC\) itself is not directly given. However, \(\angle ACB\) is part of the right triangle \(\triangle ABC\), so:
  \[
  \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \angle BAC
  \]
- Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), and \(\angle ACB\) is complementary to \(\angle BAC\), we focus on \(\angle BCG\).
- The line \(\overline{GC}\) forms a straight line with \(\overline{BC}\), so:
  \[
  \angle BCG + \angle GCB = 180^\circ
  \]
- We know \(\angle GCB = \angle CEF = 40^\circ\) because \(\overline{GC}\) is a transversal line, and \(\angle CEF\) is given as \(40^\circ\).
- Therefore:
  \[
  \angle BCG = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ
  \]
- Since \(\angle BCG\) is part of the configuration around point \(C\), and \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), we need to find the angle that complements \(\angle BCG\) to \(180^\circ\) (since \(\overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{GC}\) are straight lines):
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ
  \]
- However, \(\angle 2\) is not directly \(\angle BCG\), but rather the angle adjacent to \(\angle GCB\) on the line \(\overline{BC}\), which is:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
  \]
- Re-evaluate the configuration: \(\angle 2\) is actually the angle adjacent to \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle ACB\) in the triangle \(\triangle ABC\), which is:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 90^\circ - 36^\circ = 54^\circ
  \]
- Correct calculation: \(\angle 2\) is actually the angle formed by \(\overline{GC}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) at \(C\), which is:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
  \]
- Correct understanding: \(\angle 2\) is the angle formed by \(\overline{GC}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) at \(C\), which is:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
  \]
- Correct final calculation: \(\angle 2\) is the angle formed by \(\overline{GC}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) at \(C\), which is:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 36^\circ = 54^\circ

- The closest option to \(54^\circ\) is \(64^\circ\), which suggests a miscalculation or misunderstanding.

  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 36^\circ = 54^\circ
  \]
