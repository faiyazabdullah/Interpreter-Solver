### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: \( W, X, Y, Z, W, E, F \)
- Lines: \( WX, WX, EF, WF \)
- Hexagon: \( WXYZWEF \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{Length}(EF) = 10.5 \)
- \( \text{Length}(WF) = 14 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( \text{Congruent}(WX, WX) \) (repeated for emphasis)
- \( \text{Parallel}(WX, WX) \) (repeated for emphasis)
- \( \text{SymmetricAboutVerticalAxis}(Hexagon(WXYZWEF)) \)

**Objective:**
- Determine the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- The hexagon \( WXYZWEF \) is symmetric about a vertical axis. This implies that the hexagon is mirrored along this axis.
- The symmetry suggests that points \( W, X, Y \) on one side of the axis have corresponding points \( Z, W, E \) on the other side.
- The line \( EF \) is parallel to \( WX \) and congruent to it, indicating that \( EF \) and \( WX \) are equal in length.
- Given \( \text{Length}(EF) = 10.5 \), it follows that \( \text{Length}(WX) = 10.5 \) due to congruence.
- \( WF \) is a line segment with a length of 14.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Since the hexagon is symmetric about a vertical axis, and \( EF \) is parallel and congruent to \( WX \), the symmetry implies that the distances from the axis to \( EF \) and \( WX \) are equal.
- The symmetry also implies that the vertical distance from \( W \) to the axis is the same as from \( F \) to the axis.
- We need to find \( x \), which is likely related to the symmetry and the given lengths.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Consider the symmetry about the vertical axis. The line segment \( WF \) is divided into two equal parts by this axis due to symmetry.
- Since \( WF = 14 \), and the axis divides \( WF \) symmetrically, each half of \( WF \) is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \).
- Therefore, the distance from \( W \) to the axis (or from \( F \) to the axis) is \( 7 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The value \( x \) represents the distance from \( W \) to the axis of symmetry, which we calculated as \( 7 \).
- This matches choice B.
