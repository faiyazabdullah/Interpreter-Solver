To solve this problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Two triangles: \( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle BEC \).
- Points: \( A, B, C, E \).
- Lines: \( AE, EC, AC, BE, BC \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \angle AEC \) and \( \angle BEC \) are right angles.
- \( \angle BEC = 30^\circ \).
- \( |BC| = 10\sqrt{3} \).

**Relationships:**
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle AEC \).
- \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle BEC \).

**Positioning:**
- \( E \) is a common vertex for both triangles.

**Question:**
We need to find \( x \), which is likely related to the geometry of these triangles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- \( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle BEC \) share the side \( EC \).
- \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BEC = 90^\circ \).
- \( \angle BEC = 30^\circ \) implies \( \angle ECB = 60^\circ \) (since \( \triangle BEC \) is a right triangle).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given \( \triangle BEC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BEC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle ECB = 60^\circ \), it is a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

- \( BC = 10\sqrt{3} \) is the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( BE \)) is half the hypotenuse: \( BE = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\sqrt{3} \).
- The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( EC \)) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the hypotenuse: \( EC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 10\sqrt{3} = 15 \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Now, consider \( \triangle AEC \), which is also a right triangle with \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \).

- We know \( EC = 15 \).
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle AEC \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AEC \):

\[
AC^2 = AE^2 + EC^2
\]

We need to find \( AE \). Since \( \triangle AEC \) is a right triangle and \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
AC^2 = AE^2 + 15^2
\]

We also know \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle AEC \), but we don't have its length directly. However, we can find \( AE \) using the relationship in \( \triangle BEC \).

Since \( BE = 5\sqrt{3} \) and \( EC = 15 \), and \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \), \( AE \) must be the same as \( BE \) because \( \angle AEC \) and \( \angle BEC \) are both right angles and share the line \( EC \).

Thus, \( AE = BE = 5\sqrt{3} \).

Substitute back into the Pythagorean theorem for \( \triangle AEC \):

\[
AC^2 = (5\sqrt{3})^2 + 15^2
\]

\[
AC^2 = 75 + 225 = 300
\]

\[
AC = \sqrt{300} = 10\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, \( x = AC = 10\sqrt{3} \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated value \( AC = 10\sqrt{3} \) matches one of the answer choices.
