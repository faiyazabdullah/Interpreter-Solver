====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 6\) in the given geometric configuration, using the provided predicates and geometric reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Rectangle \(WXYZ\) with vertices \(W, X, Y, Z\).
- Point \(A\) inside the rectangle.

**Lines and Angles:**
- Lines \(WX, XY, YZ, ZW, WZ\) form the rectangle.
- Lines \(WA, XA, YA, ZA\) connect point \(A\) to each vertex.
- Right angles at \(\angle WXZ\), \(\angle XYZ\), \(\angle YZW\), \(\angle ZWX\).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \(\angle 1\) has a measure of \(30^\circ\).
- Right angles at \(\angle WXY\), \(\angle XYZ\), \(\angle YZW\), \(\angle ZWX\) each measure \(90^\circ\).
- Congruent segments: \(WA \cong AZ\) and \(XA \cong AY\).

**Relationships:**
- Parallel lines: \(WX \parallel YZ\) and \(WZ \parallel XY\).

**Objective:**
- Find the measure of \(\angle 6\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- \(WA \cong AZ\) and \(XA \cong AY\) suggest symmetry about the diagonals of the rectangle.
- \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is given, but its position relative to \(A\) is not specified.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Recognize that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal.
- Since \(WA \cong AZ\) and \(XA \cong AY\), point \(A\) is equidistant from opposite sides, suggesting it is at the intersection of the diagonals.
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and form two congruent triangles.
- Use the given \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) to find \(\angle 6\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify \(\angle 1\):**
   - Assume \(\angle 1\) is one of the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals at \(A\).
   - Since \(WA \cong AZ\) and \(XA \cong AY\), triangles \(WAX\) and \(ZAY\) are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side).

2. **Use Triangle Properties:**
   - In \(\triangle WAX\), \(\angle WAX = \angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
   - Since \(\triangle WAX\) and \(\triangle ZAY\) are congruent, \(\angle ZAY = \angle 1 = 30^\circ\).

3. **Determine \(\angle 6\):**
   - \(\angle 6\) is the angle opposite \(\angle 1\) in the congruent triangles.
   - In \(\triangle WAX\), the angles sum to \(180^\circ\): \(\angle WAX + \angle XWA + \angle AWX = 180^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle WAX = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle XWA = 90^\circ\) (right angle), \(\angle AWX = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 90^\circ = 60^\circ\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - By symmetry and congruence, \(\angle 6 = \angle AWX = 60^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 6\) is \(60^\circ\).
- Compare with answer choices: \(30, 45, 60, 90\).
- The correct choice is \(60\).
