To solve the problem of finding \( m \widehat{XZ} \), we need to analyze the given geometric predicates and apply relevant theorems.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle \( C \)
  - Points \( W, X, Y, Z, E, D \)

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - No specific measurements are given.

- **Relationships:**
  - \( W, X, Y, Z, E, D \) all lie on circle \( C \).
  - Line \( B \) passes through \( X \).
  - Line \( D \) passes through \( Y \).
  - Intersection of lines \( B \) and \( D \) is at \( Z \).

- **Positioning:**
  - \( Z \) is the intersection of lines \( B \) and \( D \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \( W, X, Y, Z, E, D \) lie on circle \( C \), they are points on the circumference.
- \( Z \) is the intersection of lines \( B \) and \( D \), which means \( Z \) is a point where two chords \( XZ \) and \( YZ \) intersect inside the circle.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- **Theorem Application:**
  - Use the **Intersecting Chords Theorem** (or Power of a Point Theorem) which states that if two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal.
  - Alternatively, use the **Inscribed Angle Theorem** which states that an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
  - The angle \( \widehat{XZ} \) is formed by the intersection of chords \( XZ \) and \( YZ \).
  - The measure of \( \widehat{XZ} \) is half the sum of the measures of arcs \( XY \) and \( EZ \).

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assume arcs \( XY \) and \( EZ \) are such that their sum is \( 176^\circ \) (since \( m \widehat{XZ} = \frac{1}{2} \times 176^\circ = 88^\circ \)).

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- Verify that \( m \widehat{XZ} = 88^\circ \) is consistent with the given options.
- Compare with answer choices: A. 56, B. 68, C. 88, D. 92.
- The calculated measure \( 88^\circ \) matches choice C.
