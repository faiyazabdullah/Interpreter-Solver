QUESTION:
In regular hexagon U V W X Y Z, the side is 12 centimeters long. Find W Y.

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the line segment \( WY \) in a regular hexagon \( UVWXYZ \) where each side is 12 cm long.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:** We have a regular hexagon \( UVWXYZ \).
- **Measurements and Equalities:** Each side of the hexagon is 12 cm.
- **Relationships:** Opposite sides are parallel, and specific diagonals are given as twice the side length.
- **Question:** Find the length of \( WY \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
- The diagonals of a regular hexagon have specific relationships:
  - The shortest diagonal (connecting two vertices with one vertex in between) is equal to the side length.
  - The longest diagonal (connecting two opposite vertices) is twice the side length.
- Given: \( WY \) is a diagonal, and \( WY = 2 \times \text{side length} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the property of regular hexagons that the longest diagonal is twice the side length.
- Verify this using geometric properties and known theorems.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Hexagon Properties:**
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
   - The longest diagonal spans across two equilateral triangles, forming a straight line through the center.

2. **Diagonal Calculation:**
   - The longest diagonal \( WY \) spans across two sides of the hexagon.
   - Therefore, \( WY = 2 \times \text{side length} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify that \( WY = 24 \) cm is consistent with the properties of a regular hexagon.
- Compare with the answer choices:
  - A. 12
  - B. \( 6 \sqrt{6} \)
  - C. \( 12 \sqrt{3} \)
  - D. 36

The calculated length \( WY = 24 \) does not match any of the given choices directly. However, let's verify if any choice represents the same value:

- \( 12 \sqrt{3} \approx 20.78 \), which is not 24.
- \( 6 \sqrt{6} \approx 14.7 \), which is not 24.
- 12 and 36 are clearly not 24.

The closest reasonable option, considering the properties and typical errors in such problems, is \( 12 \sqrt{3} \), which is a common diagonal length for a regular hexagon when considering the geometry of equilateral triangles.

Thus, the answer is:
