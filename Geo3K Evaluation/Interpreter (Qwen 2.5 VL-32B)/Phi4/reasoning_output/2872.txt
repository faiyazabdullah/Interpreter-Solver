PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the measure of \( m \angle 1 \), we will systematically analyze the given predicates and apply relevant geometric theorems.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Given Predicates:**
1. Circle(O)
2. Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D)
3. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(O))
4. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(B), Circle(O))
5. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(C), Circle(O))
6. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(D), Circle(O))
7. Arc(B, C)
8. Angle(B, D, C)

**Objective:**
Find the measure of \( m \angle 1 \), where \( \angle 1 \) is the inscribed angle subtended by arc \( BC \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle with center O.
- Arc \( BC \) is defined, and \( \angle BDC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by this arc.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Since \( \angle BDC \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( BC \), \( m \angle BDC = \frac{1}{2} \times m(\text{Arc } BC) \).

**Plan:**
1. Determine the relationship between \( \angle BDC \) and \( \angle BAC \) (another inscribed angle subtending the same arc \( BC \)).
2. Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find \( m \angle BAC \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem Application:**
   - \( m \angle BDC = \frac{1}{2} \times m(\text{Arc } BC) \).

2. **Identify \( m \angle 1 \):**
   - \( \angle 1 \) is another inscribed angle subtending arc \( BC \), so \( m \angle 1 = m \angle BAC \).
   - By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, \( m \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times m(\text{Arc } BC) \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( m \angle BDC = m \angle BAC \), both are half the measure of arc \( BC \).
   - The problem implies that \( m \angle BDC \) is given or can be calculated as a specific value.

4. **Given Choices:**
   - The only choice that fits the typical measure of an inscribed angle (half of a central angle) is 90 degrees, assuming \( m(\text{Arc } BC) = 180 \) degrees (a semicircle).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: If arc \( BC \) is a semicircle, then \( m(\text{Arc } BC) = 180^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( m \angle BDC = m \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times 180^\circ = 90^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( m \angle 1 \) is 90 degrees.
