Let's go through the problem step-by-step using the given predicates to solve for \(DF\).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle \(W\) with points \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) on it.
  - Lines \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\).
  
- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \(|ED| = 30\).
  - \(CW = WF\).
  
- **Relationships:**
  - Right angles: \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle EFD\).
  - \(AB\) and \(EF\) are diameters of circle \(W\).
  - \(W\) is the midpoint of \(CF\).

- **Special Geometric Theorems:**
  - \(AB\) and \(EF\) being diameters implies they pass through the center of the circle \(W\).

- **What to find:**
  - The length \(DF\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(AB\) and \(EF\) are diameters, they pass through the center of circle \(W\).
- \(W\) is the midpoint of \(CF\), implying \(CW = WF\).
- \(|ED| = 30\).
- \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\) because \(EF\) is a diameter and thus subtends a right angle to any point on the circle (Thales' theorem).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

1. **Use the properties of the circle and the given diameters:**
   - Since \(EF\) is a diameter, \(E, W, F\) are collinear with \(W\) as the midpoint.

2. **Right Triangle \(\triangle EFD\):**
   - Since \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), \(\triangle EFD\) is a right triangle.
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem: \(EF^2 = ED^2 + DF^2\).

3. **Determine \(EF\):**
   - \(EF\) is a diameter, so its length is twice the radius of circle \(W\).
   - Since \(W\) is the midpoint of \(CF\) and \(CW = WF\), \(EF\) spans from \(E\) through \(W\) to \(F\).

4. **Calculate \(DF\):**
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle EFD\):
     \[
     EF^2 = ED^2 + DF^2
     \]
   - Since \(EF\) is a diameter, let \(EF = 2r\). We need to find \(r\).

5. **Use the midpoint property:**
   - \(CW = WF\) and \(W\) is the midpoint of \(CF\), implying \(CF = 2 \times CW\).

6. **Relate \(EF\) to \(ED\):**
   - Since \(EF\) is a diameter and \(ED = 30\), and using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     (2r)^2 = 30^2 + DF^2
     \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Since \(EF\) is a diameter, \(EF = 2r\).
