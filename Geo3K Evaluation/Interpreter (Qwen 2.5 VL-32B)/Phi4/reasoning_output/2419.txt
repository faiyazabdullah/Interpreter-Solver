Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle(E)
- Rectangle(A, C, F, G)
- Points: A, C, F, G, E

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length(Line(A, C)) = 8
- Length(Line(C, F)) = 6
- Diameter of Circle(E) = 10

**Relationships and Positioning:**
- Line(A, C) is a diameter of Circle(E)
- Line(F, G) is a diameter of Circle(E)
- Points A, C, F, G lie on Circle(E)

**Question:**
Find the exact circumference of Circle(E).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

1. **Rectangle Inscribed in Circle:**
   - Since A, C, F, G are points on the circle and form a rectangle, the diagonals of the rectangle (AC and FG) are diameters of the circle.

2. **Diameter Information:**
   - Diameter of Circle(E) = 10

3. **Diagonals as Diameters:**
   - Line(A, C) = Diameter = 10
   - Line(F, G) = Diameter = 10

4. **Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In rectangle AC, CF, FG, GA, diagonals AC and FG are equal and both are diameters.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ACF (right triangle):
     \[
     AC^2 = AF^2 + CF^2
     \]
     \[
     10^2 = AF^2 + 6^2
     \]
     \[
     100 = AF^2 + 36
     \]
     \[
     AF^2 = 64
     \]
     \[
     AF = 8
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Since AF = 8 and CF = 6, the rectangle sides are consistent with the given lengths: AC = 10 and FG = 10.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Circumference Calculation:**
  - The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by:
    \[
    C = \pi \times \text{Diameter}
    \]
  - Substitute the diameter:
    \[
    C = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
    \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- We have verified that the diameter of the circle is 10.
- Using the formula for circumference:
  \[
  C = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated circumference \( 10\pi \) matches one of the answer choices.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
