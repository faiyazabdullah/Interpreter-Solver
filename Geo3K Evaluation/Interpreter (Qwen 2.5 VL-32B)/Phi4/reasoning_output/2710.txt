PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle 5\) given that \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\) and the measure of \(\angle 1\) equals the measure of \(\angle 5\).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Rectangle \(WXYZ\) with points \(W, X, Y, Z\).
  - Point \(A\) is the intersection of diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\).

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
  - \(m \angle 1 = m \angle 5\).

- **Relationships:**
  - \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, so all angles are right angles.
  - Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) intersect at \(A\).

- **Positioning:**
  - \(A\) is the intersection of diagonals, implying \(A\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) are equal and bisect each other at \(A\).
- The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other, forming two congruent triangles: \(\triangle WAX\) and \(\triangle ZAY\).
- \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Since \(m \angle 1 = m \angle 5\), and given \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\), it follows directly that \(m \angle 5 = 30^\circ\).
- The diagonals of a rectangle intersect at right angles, creating four angles at the intersection point \(A\).
- Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are equal and formed by the intersection of diagonals, they must each be \(30^\circ\).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- Given \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\) and \(m \angle 1 = m \angle 5\), we directly have:
  \[
  m \angle 5 = 30^\circ
  \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- The measure of \(\angle 5\) is directly given as \(30^\circ\) by the equality \(m \angle 1 = m \angle 5\).
- Therefore, the measure of \(\angle 5\) is \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the correct answer is:
