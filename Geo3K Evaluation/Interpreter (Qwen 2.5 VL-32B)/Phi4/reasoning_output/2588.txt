To solve this problem, let's follow the structured step-by-step solution process outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: We have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, lines \( \overline{AD} \) and \( \overline{FB} \), and intersection point H.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: We have two angles, Angle(3) and Angle(6). We know:
  - \( \text{RightAngle}(\text{Angle}(3)) \) implies \( m\angle 3 = 90^\circ \).
  - \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \).
  - \( m\angle 6 = 72^\circ \).
- **Positioning**: Lines \( \overline{AD} \) and \( \overline{FB} \) intersect at point H.

**Objective**: We need to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- From the predicate \( \text{RightAngle}(\text{Angle}(3)) \), we know that \( m\angle 3 = 90^\circ \).
- We also have the equation \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \).
- Given \( m\angle 6 = 72^\circ \), this information is provided but not directly needed to find \( x \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the information about Angle(3) being a right angle to set up an equation:
  \[
  x - 12 = 90
  \]
- Solve this equation for \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Start with the equation derived from the predicates:
   \[
   x - 12 = 90
   \]
2. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 90 + 12 = 102
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify the calculation:
  - If \( x = 102 \), then \( m\angle 3 = 102 - 12 = 90^\circ \), which is consistent with \( \text{RightAngle}(\text{Angle}(3)) \).
- Compare \( x = 102 \) with the answer choices:
  - A. 6
  - B. 18
  - C. 72
  - D. 84

Since none of the answer choices directly match 102, we must have made an error in interpretation. Let's re-evaluate:

- Reconsider the equation:
  \[
  x - 12 = 90
  \]
  \[
  x = 90 + 12 = 102
  \]

Upon re-evaluation, the calculation is correct, but the answer choices do not include 102. Let's ensure we didn't miss any constraints or misinterpret the problem:

- The calculation \( x = 102 \) is consistent with the given predicates and the requirement that \( m\angle 3 = 90^\circ \).
- The discrepancy suggests a potential oversight in the problem setup or answer choices.

Given the constraints and the logical steps, the closest reasonable choice that aligns with the calculated \( x \) is not present. However, if we consider the possibility of a misalignment in the problem setup, the next logical step is to choose the closest answer choice that could be a typographical error or oversight.

Thus, the closest answer choice to 102 is:
