To solve the problem, let's follow the step-by-step solution process.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: P, Q, R, S, T
- Lines: P-Q, Q-R, R-S, S-T, T-P
- Circle: U
- Pentagon: P-Q-R-S-T

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Polygon P-Q-R-S-T is equilateral and regular.
- Measure of angle \( \angle QUR = 72^\circ \).

**Relationships:**
- Pentagon P-Q-R-S-T is inscribed in circle U.
- All points P, Q, R, S, T lie on circle U.

**Question:**
Find \( m \widehat{QR} \), the measure of the arc QR.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since P-Q-R-S-T is a regular pentagon, all sides and angles are equal.
- The central angles of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle are equal.
- The circle is divided into 5 equal arcs by the vertices of the pentagon.
- The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Therefore, each central angle subtended by a side of the pentagon is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Since the pentagon is regular and inscribed in the circle, each arc between consecutive vertices is equal.
- The measure of each arc (such as arc QR) is equal to the measure of the central angle subtended by that arc.
- We already calculated the central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon as \( 72^\circ \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- The measure of arc \( \widehat{QR} \) is equal to the measure of the central angle \( \angle QUR \).
- From the given predicates, \( \angle QUR = 72^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The measure of arc \( \widehat{QR} \) is \( 72^\circ \), which matches the given measure of \( \angle QUR \).
- This confirms that our calculation is consistent with the given information.

Comparing with the answer choices:
- A. 36
- B. 72
- C. 120
- D. 144

The correct answer is \( 72^\circ \).
