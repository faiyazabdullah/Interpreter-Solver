Let's systematically analyze the given geometric predicates and solve the problem step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- A square is defined by points A, B, C, D.

**Points:**
- Points are given as Q, Q (repeated), and X. This indicates point Q is of interest.

**Lines:**
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the square.
- Line QQ is a degenerate line (length 0) as it connects the point Q to itself.
- Line QC is a line from point Q to point C.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length of Line QC is given as both 5 and 15, indicating a contradiction or error. We will use the consistent value of 15 for further analysis.
- Length of Line QQ is given as x, and we have \( \text{Equals}(x, \text{Sub}(\text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C)}), \text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C))})) \), which simplifies to \( x = 0 \) since subtracting a length from itself results in zero.
- \( \text{Add}(\text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C))}, \text{LengthOf(Line(Q,Q))}, \text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C))}) \) doesn't provide new information as it simplifies to \( 15 + 0 + 15 = 30 \).
- \( \text{Equals}(x, 10) \) contradicts \( x = 0 \), suggesting an error or misinterpretation.
- \( \text{RatioOf}(\text{LengthOf(Line(Q,Q))}, \text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C))}, 2) \) implies \( \frac{0}{15} = 2 \), which is incorrect. This indicates a misunderstanding or misstatement.

**Objective:**
- Find the scale factor from Q to Q'.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- The key consistent information is that the length of Line QC is 15.
- The length of Line QQ is 0, as derived from the subtraction predicate.
- The ratio predicate is inconsistent, suggesting a focus on the consistent length information.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- The problem asks for a scale factor from Q to Q'. Given the contradictions and inconsistencies, we focus on the consistent length of QC being 15.
- The scale factor typically relates to a transformation where a point Q' is a scaled version of Q with respect to some center or line.
- Given the ratio \( \frac{0}{15} = 2 \) is incorrect, we interpret the intended meaning as a scale factor from Q to a point Q' such that the distance from Q to C is scaled.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Assume Q' is a point such that the distance from Q to C is scaled by a factor k.
- If QC = 15, then Q'C = k * QC = k * 15.
- The ratio \( \frac{\text{LengthOf(Line(Q,Q))}}{\text{LengthOf(Line(Q,C))}} = 2 \) suggests a misunderstanding, but if we interpret it as a scale factor, it implies Q' is twice as far from C as Q is.
- Therefore, k = 2.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The consistent interpretation of the predicates suggests a scale factor of 2, aligning with the intended ratio despite the contradictions.
- Verify: If Q' is twice as far from C as Q, then the scale factor is indeed 2.

Thus, the scale factor from Q to Q' is 2.
