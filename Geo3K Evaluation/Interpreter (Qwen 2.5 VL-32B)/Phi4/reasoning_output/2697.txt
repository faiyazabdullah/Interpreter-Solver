To solve the problem, let's follow the structured approach as outlined:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- We have points A, B, C, and D.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA form a quadrilateral ABCD.
- We are given that Line AB is parallel to Line DC.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Measure of Angle D is 65 degrees.
- Sum of Measure of Angle A and Measure of Angle D is 180 degrees.

**Identify the Task:**
- We need to find the measure of Angle A, denoted as \( x \).

**Special Geometric Constructions/Theorems:**
- Since AB is parallel to DC, and AD and BC are transversals, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- From the given, Measure of Angle D = 65 degrees.
- Sum of Measure of Angle A and Measure of Angle D = 180 degrees.

Using the equation:
\[ \text{Measure of Angle A} + \text{Measure of Angle D} = 180 \]

Substitute the known value:
\[ x + 65 = 180 \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Solve for \( x \) using the equation derived from the parallel line properties and angle sum.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Solve the equation:
  \[
  x + 65 = 180
  \]

- Subtract 65 from both sides:
  \[
  x = 180 - 65
  \]

- Calculate:
  \[
  x = 115
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The calculation is correct and consistent with the properties of parallel lines and the sum of angles.
- Compare with answer choices: 115 is one of the options.

Thus, the measure of Angle A is 115 degrees.
