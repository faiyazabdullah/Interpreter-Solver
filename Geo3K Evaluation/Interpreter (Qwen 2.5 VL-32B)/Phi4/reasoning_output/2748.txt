PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine which additional fact would suffice to prove that line \(d\) (Line \(A,B\)) is parallel to line \(XZ\).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Triangle \(X, Y, Z\)
- Points: \(X, Y, Z, A, B\)
- Lines: \(XY, YZ, XZ, AB\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 1) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle XYZ) \)
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 3) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle YZX) \)

**Relationships:**
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(A, \text{Line}(X,Y)) \)
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(B, \text{Line}(Y,Z)) \)
- \( \text{IntersectAt}(\text{Line}(X,Y), \text{Line}(A,B), \text{Point}(A)) \)
- \( \text{IntersectAt}(\text{Line}(Y,Z), \text{Line}(A,B), \text{Point}(B)) \)
- \( \text{Parallel}(\text{Line}(A,B), \text{Line}(X,Z)) \)

**Positioning:**
- \( \text{Line}(A,B) \) intersects \( \text{Line}(X,Y) \) at \( A \) and \( \text{Line}(Y,Z) \) at \( B \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- We know \( \text{Line}(A,B) \) is parallel to \( \text{Line}(X,Z) \) by the given predicate.
- \( \angle 1 \cong \angle XYZ \) and \( \angle 3 \cong \angle YZX \) imply that angles formed by intersections with \( \text{Line}(A,B) \) are corresponding to angles in triangle \(XYZ\).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

To prove that line \(d\) is parallel to \(XZ\), we can use the concept of corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by a transversal with two parallel lines.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

Given:
- \( \angle 1 \cong \angle XYZ \)
- \( \angle 3 \cong \angle YZX \)

We need to establish a relationship that confirms \( \text{Line}(A,B) \parallel \text{Line}(X,Z) \).

- **Corresponding Angles Postulate**: If two lines are cut by a transversal and the corresponding angles are congruent, the lines are parallel.

- **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**: If two lines are cut by a transversal and the alternate interior angles are congruent, the lines are parallel.

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- **Option A**: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)
  - This does not directly relate to \( \angle XYZ \) or \( \angle YZX \) with any angle on line \(XZ\).

- **Option B**: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)
  - If \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \), then by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, \( \text{Line}(A,B) \parallel \text{Line}(X,Z) \).

- **Option C**: \( \angle 2 \cong \angle X \)
  - This does not directly relate to the angles involved with line \(XZ\).

- **Option D**: \( \angle 3 \cong \angle Z \)
  - This would not directly help in proving parallelism with line \(XZ\).

Thus, the fact that would be sufficient to prove that line \(d\) is parallel to \(XZ\) is:

Final Answer: B
