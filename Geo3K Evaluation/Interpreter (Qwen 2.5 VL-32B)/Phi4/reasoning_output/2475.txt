PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem using a structured approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP
- We have geometric points and angles, but the problem mainly involves angle measures.
- We're given:
  - \( m \angle 4 = 2x + 23 \)
  - \( m \angle 5 = 7x - 5 \)
  - \( \text{Sum of } m \angle 4 \text{ and } m \angle 5 = 180 \)

The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS
- We know that the sum of the measures of angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) is 180 degrees, suggesting they are supplementary. This is a key relationship.
- The equations provided are:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 4) = 2x + 23
  \]
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 5) = 7x - 5
  \]
  \[
  \text{SumOf}(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 4), \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 5)) = 180
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY
- We will set up an equation using the sum of the angles and solve for \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION
- Using the sum of angles:
  \[
  (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2x + 23 + 7x - 5 = 180
  \]
  \[
  9x + 18 = 180
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  9x = 180 - 18
  \]
  \[
  9x = 162
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{162}{9}
  \]
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION
- Verify by substituting \( x = 18 \) back into the expressions for the angles:
  - \( m \angle 4 = 2(18) + 23 = 36 + 23 = 59 \)
  - \( m \angle 5 = 7(18) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121 \)
  - Check the sum: \( 59 + 121 = 180 \), which is correct.

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 18, matching choice B.
