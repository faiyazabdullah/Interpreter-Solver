====================================================================================================
Let's approach the problem step by step using the given geometric predicates:

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Elements:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
- Lines: AB, BG, GH, AF, FD, GC, FE, CE, AC, DF

**Angles and Measures:**
- Angle(H, G, B) = 55°
- Angle(A, F, D) = x
- Right Angles: Angle(G, C, F), Angle(F, E, D), Angle(A, C, F)

**Parallel and Perpendicular Relationships:**
- Parallel Lines: GC || FE, AC || DF
- Perpendicular Lines: GC ⊥ AC, FE ⊥ AC, AC ⊥ DF

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- **Right Angles:**
  - Angle(G, C, F) is a right angle.
  - Angle(F, E, D) is a right angle.
  - Angle(A, C, F) is a right angle.

- **Parallel Lines:**
  - GC is parallel to FE.
  - AC is parallel to DF.

- **Perpendicular Lines:**
  - GC is perpendicular to AC.
  - FE is perpendicular to AC.
  - AC is perpendicular to DF.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

We need to find the measure of Angle(A, F, D) = x. Let's analyze the relationships:

1. **Angle Relationships:**
   - Since AC is perpendicular to DF, Angle(A, C, F) is a right angle (90°).
   - Since FE is perpendicular to AC, Angle(F, E, D) is a right angle (90°).

2. **Parallel Line Implications:**
   - Since GC is parallel to FE and both are perpendicular to AC, they form a set of corresponding angles with AC.

3. **Angle at Point G:**
   - Angle(H, G, B) = 55°, and since GC is perpendicular to AC, Angle(G, C, F) = 90°.

4. **Triangle Analysis:**
   - Consider triangle AFD. Since AC is parallel to DF and perpendicular to AC, Angle(A, C, F) = 90°.
   - Angle(F, E, D) = 90°, and since FE is perpendicular to AC, it implies that Angle(F, D, A) is also 90°.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- In triangle AFD:
  - Angle(A, C, F) = 90°
  - Angle(F, E, D) = 90°
  - Therefore, Angle(A, F, D) = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°

However, this is incorrect because we need to consider the correct configuration:

- Since AC is parallel to DF and perpendicular to AC, and considering the parallel line properties:
  - Angle(A, F, D) is supplementary to Angle(F, E, D) because they form a linear pair along line DF.

- Therefore, Angle(A, F, D) = 180° - 90° = 90°

But this doesn't match any options, so let's reconsider:

- Since Angle(H, G, B) = 55° and considering the parallel and perpendicular relationships:
  - Angle(G, C, F) = 90°
  - Angle(F, E, D) = 90°
  - Angle(A, C, F) = 90°

- Using the exterior angle theorem in triangle BGC:
  - Angle(B, G, C) = 180° - 55° = 125°

- Since GC || FE and AC is a transversal:
  - Angle(G, C, F) = Angle(F, E, D) = 90°
  - Angle(A, F, D) = Angle(B, G, C) = 125°

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

The calculated value for Angle(A, F, D) is 125°, which matches option C.

Final Answer: C
