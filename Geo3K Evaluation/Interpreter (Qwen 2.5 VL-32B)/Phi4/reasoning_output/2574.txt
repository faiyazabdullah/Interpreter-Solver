Let's solve the problem step-by-step according to the given predicates and determine the measure of \(\widehat{GLJ}\).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

1. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Circle \(K\)
   - Points: \(G, H, J, L, K\)

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - \(GJ\) is a diameter of circle \(K\).
   - \(\text{Arc}(G,H,J)\) measures 122 degrees.
   - \(\text{Arc}(G,L,J)\) is given with \(\text{Arc}(G,J) = 180\) degrees.

3. **Relationships:**
   - \(GJ\) being a diameter implies that \(\text{Arc}(G,J) = 180^\circ\).
   - \(\text{Arc}(G,H,J) = 122^\circ\) and \(\text{Arc}(H,J,K)\) would be the rest of the semicircle, making it \(180 - 122 = 58^\circ\).

4. **Objective:**
   - Find \(m \widehat{GLJ}\).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \(GJ\) is a diameter, \(\text{Arc}(G,J) = 180^\circ\) implies that \(G\) and \(J\) are endpoints of a diameter.
- \(\text{Arc}(G,H,J) = 122^\circ\) means \(H\) lies on the arc between \(G\) and \(J\).
- \(\text{Arc}(G,L,J)\) is the arc from \(G\) to \(J\) passing through \(L\).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Use the property of inscribed angles: An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
- \(\text{Arc}(G,L,J)\) is part of the semicircle, and we need to find the inscribed angle \(\widehat{GLJ}\).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- Since \(GJ\) is a diameter, any angle inscribed in the semicircle \(\text{Arc}(G,J)\) is a right angle.
- \(\text{Arc}(G,L,J)\) is part of the semicircle, and \(\widehat{GLJ}\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \(GLJ\).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
- \(\text{Arc}(G,L,J) = \text{Arc}(G,J) = 180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(m \widehat{GLJ} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180^\circ = 90^\circ\).

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- The calculated measure \(m \widehat{GLJ} = 90^\circ\) matches option A.
