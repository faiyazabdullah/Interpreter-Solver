Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
- Lines: a (D, G), b (E, C), GH (G, H), BD (B, D), BE (B, E), AF (A, F), AC (A, C)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Angle(DBE) has a measure of \(4x + 11\)
- Angle(BAC) has a measure of \(8x + 1\)
- MeasureOf(Angle(DBE)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(BAC))

**Relationships:**
- Lines a and b are parallel (Parallel(a, b))

**Positioning:**
- Lines BD and BE intersect at point B
- Lines AF and AC intersect at point A

**Special Geometric Constructions/Theorems:**
- The angles DBE and BAC are given as equal, which is a crucial piece of information.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since lines a and b are parallel, and we know that angle DBE equals angle BAC, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals. Specifically, if two lines are parallel, then alternate interior angles are equal, corresponding angles are equal, etc.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(DBE)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(BAC)), we can set up the equation:

\[ 4x + 11 = 8x + 1 \]

This equation arises from the equality of the measures of the two angles.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Let's solve the equation:

\[ 4x + 11 = 8x + 1 \]

Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:

\[ 11 = 4x + 1 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 10 = 4x \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

We have found \(x = 2.5\). Let's verify:

- If \(x = 2.5\), then:
  - MeasureOf(Angle(DBE)) = \(4(2.5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21\)
  - MeasureOf(Angle(BAC)) = \(8(2.5) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\)

Both angles are indeed equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

Comparing with the answer choices:
- A. 2.5
- B. 14
- C. 15
- D. 16

The correct choice is A.
