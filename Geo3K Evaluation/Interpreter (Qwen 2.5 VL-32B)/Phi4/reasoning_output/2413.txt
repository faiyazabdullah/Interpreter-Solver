====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow a systematic approach using the given predicates and geometric reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rhombus ABCD with points A, B, C, D.
- Point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Lengths of all sides of the rhombus are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA = 6.
- Diagonals intersect at E, forming right angles: ∠AEC and ∠BED are right angles.
- Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

**Relationships:**
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular and bisect each other.
- Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

**Question:**
Find m∠ACD.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since ABCD is a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.
- Diagonals AC and BD bisect the angles of the rhombus.
- Given m∠DAB = 2m∠ADC, and CB = 6 (which is consistent with the side length).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the properties of rhombuses and the given angle relationships.
- Recognize that diagonals bisect the angles, and use the given angle relationship m∠DAB = 2m∠ADC.
- Use the fact that diagonals are perpendicular to find angles involving the diagonals.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Properties of Rhombus:**
   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
   - Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

2. **Angle Relationships:**
   - Let m∠DAB = 2x and m∠ADC = x.
   - Since diagonals bisect the angles, m∠DAC = x and m∠BAC = x.
   - In triangle ABD, m∠BAD = 2x, m∠ABD = 2y, m∠ADB = 90° (since diagonals are perpendicular).

3. **Sum of Angles in Triangle ABD:**
   - m∠BAD + m∠ABD + m∠ADB = 180°
   - 2x + 2y + 90° = 180°
   - 2x + 2y = 90°
   - x + y = 45°

4. **Using m∠DAC = x:**
   - In triangle ACD, m∠ACD = 90° - x (since m∠AEC = 90° and m∠DAC = x).

5. **Substitute x:**
   - From x + y = 45°, and knowing m∠DAB = 2x, we have m∠DAC = x.
   - Since m∠DAC = x, and m∠ACD = 90° - x, we need to find x.

6. **Determine x:**
   - Since m∠DAB = 2x and m∠DAC = x, and knowing the sum of angles in triangle ABD:
   - m∠DAB = 2x = 2(45° - y) = 90° - 2y.
   - Since m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠DAC = x, we have x = 45° - y.

7. **Find m∠ACD:**
   - m∠ACD = 90° - x = 90° - (45° - y) = 45° + y.
   - Since x + y = 45°, y = 45° - x.
   - Substitute back: m∠ACD = 45° + (45° - x) = 90° - x + 45° = 90°.

Thus, m∠ACD = 90°.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated m∠ACD = 90° matches one of the answer choices.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
