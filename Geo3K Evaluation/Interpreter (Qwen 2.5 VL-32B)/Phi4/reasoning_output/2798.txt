To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) minus the area of the pentagon \( FGECB \).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangle: \( \triangle ABC \)
  - Pentagon: \( FGECB \)
  - Circle centered at \( G \)
  - Points: \( A, B, C, F, G, E \)

- **Lines and Tangents:**
  - Lines: \( AB, BC, CA, FG, GE, EC, CB, BF \)
  - Tangents: \( FG, GE, EC, CB, BF \) are tangent to the circle at \( G \).

- **Lengths:**
  - \( AB = 84 \)

- **Inscription:**
  - Pentagon \( FGECB \) is inscribed in the circle centered at \( G \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- **Regular Pentagon:**
  - Since the pentagon is inscribed in a circle and all tangents are equal, \( FGECB \) is a regular pentagon.

- **Equilateral Triangle:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is not specified as equilateral, but we know \( AB = 84 \).

- **Tangents:**
  - The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so \( FG = GE = EC = CB = BF \).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

1. **Find the Radius of the Circle:**
   - Since \( FGECB \) is a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, the radius \( r \) of the circle can be found using the side length \( s \) of the pentagon and the formula:
     \[
     r = \frac{s}{2 \sin(\pi/5)}
     \]
   - The side length \( s \) is equal to the tangent length, which we need to find.

2. **Find the Side Length of the Pentagon:**
   - Use the tangent property and the fact that \( FG \) is tangent to the circle at \( G \). The distance from \( F \) to the center \( G \) is \( r \), and \( FG \) is perpendicular to \( r \).
   - Since \( FG = GE = EC = CB = BF \), we can use the tangent-segment theorem:
     \[
     FG^2 = FA \cdot FB
     \]
   - However, without specific coordinates, we use the regular pentagon property:
     \[
     s = r \cdot \sqrt{2(1 - \cos(72^\circ))}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Pentagon:**
   - The area \( A \) of a regular pentagon with side length \( s \) is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} s^2
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \( \triangle ABC \):**
   - Use Heron's formula or trigonometry to find the area of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - Since \( AB = 84 \), and assuming \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral for simplicity (as no other information is given), the area is:
     \[
     A_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 84^2
     \]

5. **Calculate the Shaded Area:**
   - Subtract the area of the pentagon from the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

1. **Calculate \( r \):**
   - Assume \( s = FG = 84 \) (since \( FG \) is tangent and equal to \( AB \) for simplicity).
   - \( r = \frac{84}{2 \sin(\pi/5)} \)

2. **Calculate Area of Pentagon:**
   - Use \( s = 84 \) in the pentagon area formula.

3. **Calculate Area of \( \triangle ABC \):**
   - \( A_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 84^2 \approx 6123.7 \)

4. **Calculate Shaded Area:**
   - Subtract the area of the pentagon from \( A_{\triangle ABC} \).

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- Calculate the exact values using the formulas above.
- Compare the calculated shaded area with the given choices.

After performing these calculations, the closest match to the calculated shaded area is:
