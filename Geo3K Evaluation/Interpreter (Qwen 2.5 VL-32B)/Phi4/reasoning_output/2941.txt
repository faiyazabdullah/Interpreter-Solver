PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of a central angle in the given geometric configuration. Let's go through the process step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot K\).
- Points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on circle \(\odot K\).
- \(F\) is the center of circle \(\odot K\).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \(F\) is equidistant from \(A, B, C, D\) (since these are radii of the circle).
- \(Line(A, C)\) and \(Line(B, D)\) are diagonals of the square and are perpendicular.
- The angles \(\angle AFB, \angle BFD, \angle DFC, \angle CFA\) are all \(90^\circ\).

**Relationships:**
- \(Line(A, C)\) and \(Line(B, D)\) intersect at \(F\), forming four \(90^\circ\) angles.
- The diagonals of the square bisect each other at right angles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(ABDC\) is a square, its diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are equal and bisect each other at right angles.
- The diagonals of the square divide the circle into four equal arcs.
- Each arc subtended by the diagonals at the center \(F\) is \(90^\circ\) because the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find the measure of a central angle.
- The central angle subtended by any side of the square (e.g., \(\angle AFB\)) is \(90^\circ\).
- The central angle subtended by a diagonal (e.g., \(\angle AFC\)) is \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- The square divides the circle into four equal arcs, each subtending a \(90^\circ\) angle at the center \(F\).
- Therefore, the central angle subtended by any side of the square is \(90^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The problem asks for the measure of a central angle.
- The central angle subtended by a side of the square is \(90^\circ\), which matches one of the answer choices.

Thus, the measure of a central angle is \(90^\circ\).
