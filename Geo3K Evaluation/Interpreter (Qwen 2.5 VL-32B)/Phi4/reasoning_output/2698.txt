====================================================================================================
To solve the given geometric problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: T, W, Y, X
- Lines: T-X, W-X, Y-X, T-W, W-Y

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length of Line(T, W) = 4x
- Length of Line(W, Y) = 2x + 10

**Relationships:**
- Congruent(Line(T, W), Line(W, Y))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(T, W)), 4x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(W, Y)), 2x + 10)

**Question:**
We need to find the value of \( x \) such that the triangles \(\triangle WTY\) and \(\triangle T WY\) are congruent.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Given:
- Line(T, W) is congruent to Line(W, Y), so \( 4x = 2x + 10 \).

This equation arises from the congruence of the segments and the given lengths.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \( x \), solve the equation derived from the congruence of Line(T, W) and Line(W, Y).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Set up the equation from the congruence:
   \[
   4x = 2x + 10
   \]

2. Solve for \( x \):
   - Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
     \[
     4x - 2x = 10
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2x = 10
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: Substituting \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for the lengths:
  - Length of Line(T, W) = \( 4x = 4(5) = 20 \)
  - Length of Line(W, Y) = \( 2x + 10 = 2(5) + 10 = 20 \)

Both lengths are equal, confirming the congruence condition is satisfied.

- Compare with answer choices:
  - A. 2
  - B. 4
  - C. 5
  - D. 10

The calculated value \( x = 5 \) matches choice C.
