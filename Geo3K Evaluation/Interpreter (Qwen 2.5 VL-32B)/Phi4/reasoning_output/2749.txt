Let's work through the given problem step by step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- We have a rectangle \(WXYZ\) with points \(W, X, Y, Z\).
- Point \(P\) is defined, and lines \(ZW\), \(WX\), \(XY\), \(YZ\), \(ZW\), \(ZY\), \(WY\), \(ZP\), and \(PY\) are given.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- We have several equalities:
  - \(ZY = WX\)
  - \(ZY = WY\)
  - \(ZY = ZP + PY\)
  - \(ZP = 4x - 9\)
  - \(PY = 2x + 5\)

**Relationships:**
- \(ZW\), \(WX\), \(XY\), \(YZ\) are sides of the rectangle, hence perpendicular at each corner.
- The right angles at each corner ensure that \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.

**What We Need to Find:**
- We need to determine \(ZX\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(WX = YZ\) and \(WY = XZ\).
  - Diagonals are equal: \(WY = XZ\).

- From the given \(ZY = ZP + PY\), substitute:
  \[
  ZY = (4x - 9) + (2x + 5) = 6x - 4
  \]

- We know \(ZY = WX\), so:
  \[
  WX = 6x - 4
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \(ZX\), we use the properties of a rectangle:
- The diagonals of a rectangle are equal, so \(WY = XZ\).
- Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle WZY\), where \(WY\) is the diagonal:
  \[
  WY^2 = WZ^2 + ZY^2
  \]

- Since \(ZY = WY\), \(\triangle WZY\) is isosceles right triangle, and:
  \[
  WZ = ZY = 6x - 4
  \]

- Therefore, \(WY = \sqrt{WZ^2 + ZY^2} = \sqrt{2(ZY)^2} = ZY\sqrt{2}\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Since \(WY = ZY\sqrt{2}\), we have:
   \[
   WY = (6x - 4)\sqrt{2}
   \]

2. \(ZX\) is the other diagonal, and since diagonals are equal:
   \[
   ZX = WY = (6x - 4)\sqrt{2}
   \]

3. We need to find \(x\) such that \(ZP + PY = ZY\):
   \[
   (4x - 9) + (2x + 5) = 6x - 4
   \]

4. Solving for \(x\) is not necessary here because we need \(ZY\) to find \(ZX\).

5. Substitute \(ZY = 6x - 4\) into the diagonal equation:
   \[
   ZX = (6x - 4)\sqrt{2}
   \]

6. We need to find the value of \(ZX\) when \(ZP = 4x - 9\) and \(PY = 2x + 5\).

7. Calculate \(ZY\) using \(ZP + PY = ZY\):
   \[
   ZY = (4x - 9) + (2x + 5) = 6x - 4
   \]

8. Set \(6x - 4 = 19\) (since \(ZY\) must be a whole number from the answer choices):
   \[
   6x - 4 = 19 \implies 6x = 23 \implies x = \frac{23}{6}
   \]

9. Calculate \(ZX\):
   \[
   ZX = 19\sqrt{2}
   \]

10. Since \(ZX\) must be a whole number, check the closest integer:
    - \(19\sqrt{2} \approx 26.87\), closest integer is 27.

11. Check the answer choices for the closest value:
    - \(19\) is the closest integer to \(19\sqrt{2}\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify \(ZY = 19\) satisfies all conditions:
  - \(ZP + PY = 19\)
  - \(ZX = 19\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 27, but \(19\) is the closest integer choice.

Thus, the correct answer is:
