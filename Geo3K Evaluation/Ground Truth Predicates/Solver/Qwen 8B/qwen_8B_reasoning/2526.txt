Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several angle measures given and some points lying on lines. The main goal is to find the measure of angle 2, which is denoted as ∠GA D, right? Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the constraints provided.

First, let's note down all the given information:

- Angle at A, between G and E (Angle(A, G, E)) is 104 degrees.
- Angle at B, between C and D (Angle(B, C, D)) equals angle 8.
- Angle at C, between G and B (Angle(C, G, B)) equals angle 3.
- Angle at A, between D and G (Angle(A, D, G)) is 36 degrees.
- Angle at F, between E and C (Angle(F, E, C)) is 40 degrees.
- Angle at B, between F and C (Angle(F, B, C)) equals angle 6.
- Angle at A, between B and E (Angle(A, B, E)) equals angle 5.
- Angle at D, between G and A (Angle(D, G, A)) equals angle 1.
- Angle at C, between E and B (Angle(C, E, B)) equals angle 7.
- Angle at G, between A and D (Angle(G, A, D)) equals angle 2. Wait, that's angle 2, which is what we need to find!
- Also, there are points lying on specific lines. For example, point G lies on line BA, E lies on line BF and CD, etc. Plus, BC is perpendicular to BA.

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, that means angle ABC is 90 degrees. That might be important for figuring out other angles.

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, so triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B. Then, points E and G lie on certain lines. Let me see:

- Point E lies on line BF and also on line CD and CG. Hmm. And point G lies on BA and CD and EG. Maybe there are multiple intersections here. This seems complex, but maybe I can use the given angles and relationships to find relations between them.

Starting with the known angles. Let me list all the angles mentioned:

Given:

1. ∠AGE = 104°
2. ∠BCD = angle8
3. ∠CG B = angle3
4. ∠ADG = 36°
5. ∠FEC = 40°
6. ∠FBC = angle6
7. ∠ABE = angle5
8. ∠DGA = angle1
9. ∠CEB = angle7
10. ∠GAD = angle2 (which we need to find)

Also, since AB ⊥ BC, then ∠ABC = 90°. 

Now, perhaps I should look for triangles where these angles are located and apply triangle angle sum theorem, or maybe using vertical angles, supplementary angles, or properties of parallel lines?

But first, maybe it's better to assign variables to unknown angles and set up equations. Let me denote each angle with their respective labels.

Let me note that some angles might be related through straight lines, vertical angles, or transversals. Also, considering that certain points lie on specific lines, which could mean that lines intersecting at those points create various triangles or other polygons.

Let me consider the key points:

- Point G lies on BA and CD. So, BA is a line containing points B and A, and G is somewhere on BA. Also, CD is another line containing points C and D, and G is on that line too. Therefore, lines BA and CD intersect at point G. Similarly, E is on BF, CD, and CG. So, E is the intersection of BF, CD, and CG. 

Wait, since E is on line CD and line CG. But point G is already on CD, so line CG connects C to G, which is on CD. Therefore, line CG would just be part of CD? Wait, no. If G is on CD, then line CG is the same as line CD. Wait, but E is on line CD and also on line CG. If G is on CD, then line CG is the line from C to G, which is along CD. Therefore, E is on line CD and also on line CG, which implies that E is on line CD. But E is also on BF. So E is the intersection of BF and CD. 

Similarly, G is on BA and CD. So, BA intersects CD at point G. So, BA and CD meet at G. Therefore, quadrilateral or something else... Maybe triangle BCD with point G on CD? Or triangle BGC?

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think about possible triangles and how the angles relate.

Starting with triangle ABC. Since AB ⊥ BC, triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Therefore, angles at A and C add up to 90 degrees. However, without knowing more sides or angles, maybe not directly helpful yet.

Looking at angle ∠AGE = 104°. Let me imagine point G on BA. So, point G is somewhere on BA, and E is connected to G such that ∠AGE is formed. Also, E is on CD and BF. Maybe triangle AGE has some relation.

Another angle given is ∠ADG = 36°. Since G is on BA and CD, ADG is an angle at D between A and G. Wait, angle ADG would be at D, between A and G. Wait, angle notation: ∠(A, D, G) is the angle at D between points A, D, G. So, vertex at D, with segments DA and DG. So, that angle is 36 degrees. 

Similarly, ∠DGA = angle1. Which is angle at G between D and A. So, ∠DGA is at G, between D and A. So, that's adjacent to angle ADG. In triangle ADG, we have two angles: at D (36°) and at G (angle1). The third angle is at A. Wait, but where is point A in relation to this triangle? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADG. Let me consider that. If I can find some relations in triangle ADG, maybe using the fact that angles sum to 180 degrees. But I don't know angle at A yet. But maybe there's more info.

Also, ∠AGD is angle2, which is what we need to find. Wait, ∠(G, A, D) is angle at A between G and D? No, wait. The angle notation ∠(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So ∠(G,A,D) is the angle at A between G and D. So that's angle at A between GA and DA. Which would be part of angle at A in triangle AGD. 

So, in triangle ADG, angles are:

At D: 36° (from ∠ADG)

At G: angle1 (∠DGA)

At A: angle2 (∠GAD)

Therefore, sum of angles in triangle ADG is 36 + angle1 + angle2 = 180. So,

angle1 + angle2 = 180 - 36 = 144°. So equation 1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°.

But we need more relations to connect these angles.

Looking elsewhere. There's also ∠AGE = 104°, which is angle at G between A and E. So, that's angle AG E. Since point G is on BA, and E is on CD and BF. So, line GE connects G to E. 

Perhaps considering triangle AGE? In triangle AGE, we have angle at G being 104°, and maybe other angles can be determined if we can find relations.

But to do that, we need more information about other angles in that triangle. Alternatively, maybe considering other triangles involving E.

Also, there's ∠FEC = 40°, which is angle at E between F and C. Since E is on BF and CD, so FE is part of BF, and EC is part of CD. So, triangle FEC has angle at E equal to 40°. 

Additionally, ∠FBC = angle6. Since F is connected to B and C. So, angle at B between F and C. Since BC is perpendicular to BA, and F is on BF, which is connected to B. Maybe triangle FBC has some relations?

Moreover, ∠ABE = angle5. Since E is on BF, and BE is part of BF. So, angle at B between A and E. Since BA is perpendicular to BC, and BE is a segment from B to E on BF. So, angle ABE is part of angle ABC (which is 90°). Therefore, angle ABE (angle5) plus angle EBC equals 90°. 

But angle EBC is part of angle FBC (angle6)? Because F is on BF, so angle FBC is the angle at B between F and C. If E is on BF, then angle EBC is the same as angle FBC? Wait, if E is on BF, then BE is a subset of BF. So, angle between BE and BC is the same as angle between BF and BC, which is angle FBC (angle6). So, angle EBC = angle6. Therefore, angle ABE (angle5) + angle EBC (angle6) = 90°, because they make up angle ABC. So:

angle5 + angle6 = 90°. Equation 2: angle5 + angle6 = 90°.

That's useful. Now, moving on.

There's also ∠CEB = angle7. Since E is on CD and BF, so CE is part of CD, and EB is part of BF. Therefore, angle at E between C and B is angle CEB (angle7). So, in triangle CEB, we have angle at E (angle7), angle at C, and angle at B. Wait, angle at B is angle EBC (angle6), which we've established earlier. So, in triangle CEB:

angle at E: angle7

angle at B: angle6

angle at C: ?

Sum of angles in triangle CEB is 180°, so angle7 + angle6 + angle at C = 180°. Therefore, angle at C in triangle CEB is 180 - angle6 - angle7.

But angle at C in triangle CEB is the same as angle BCE. Wait, angle BCE is part of angle BCD? Because point D is on line CD. So, angle BCD is angle8, which is given. Therefore, angle BCE (from triangle CEB) is part of angle BCD. Depending on where E is located on CD, but since E is on CD, then angle BCE is part of angle BCD. So, angle BCD (angle8) = angle BCE + ... ? Wait, if E is on CD, then from point C, looking towards D, and E is somewhere on CD. So, angle BCD is the angle at C between B and D. If E is on CD, then angle BCE is part of angle BCD. Therefore, angle BCE = angle8 minus some other angle?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. At point C, angle BCD is the angle between CB and CD. If E is on CD, then from point C, the line CE is along CD towards E. So, angle BCE is the same as angle BCD. Wait, no. If E is on CD, then CE is a segment from C to E on CD. So, angle at C between B and E would be angle BCE, which is the same as angle BCD only if E is at D. Otherwise, if E is between C and D, then angle BCE is part of angle BCD. So, angle BCD (angle8) = angle BCE + angle ECD. Unless E is beyond D, but likely E is between C and D. So, angle8 = angle BCE + angle ECD. However, unless we have more info, this may not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe focusing back on triangle CEB. We had angle7 + angle6 + angle at C = 180. So angle at C is 180 - angle6 - angle7. But angle at C in triangle CEB is angle BCE, which relates to angle BCD (angle8). If we can express angle BCE in terms of angle8, that might help. But without knowing where E is on CD, it's hard to say. Maybe we need to find relations via other angles.

Let me check other angles. There's ∠CG B = angle3. So, angle at G between C and B. Since G is on BA and CD. So, point G is the intersection of BA and CD. Therefore, line BG is BA itself, since G is on BA. So, angle at G between C and B would be angle between GC and GB. Since GB is along BA, and GC is part of CD. Therefore, angle at G between C and B is the angle between GC and GB, which is the angle between CD and BA at point G. Wait, but BA and CD intersect at G, forming vertical angles. Since BA is perpendicular to BC, but not sure about CD's relation.

Alternatively, since BA is perpendicular to BC, and G is on BA, so line BG is BA. So, angle between GC and BG is angle between GC and BA. Which is angle between line GC (part of CD) and BA. Since BA is perpendicular to BC, but CD is another line passing through G. Not sure yet.

But angle CG B (angle3) is at G between C and B. So, that's angle between GC and GB. Since GB is BA, and GC is part of CD. So, angle between BA and CD at point G. Which is the same as the angle between BA and CD. Let me call this angle as angle between BA and CD at G, which is angle3. 

But BA is perpendicular to BC, so maybe we can find relations between angles here. Also, since BA and CD intersect at G, forming vertical angles. So, angle between BA and CD at G is angle3, and its vertical angle would be the same. Also, the other pair of angles formed by the intersection would be supplementary if BA and CD are not parallel. But without knowing if BA and CD are parallel, it's hard to tell. However, since we have other angles given, maybe we can find angle3 in terms of others.

Alternatively, considering triangle BGC. Since G is on BA and CD. So, triangle BGC has vertices at B, G, C. In this triangle, angle at G is angle3, angle at B is angle between GB and BC. Since GB is BA, which is perpendicular to BC, so angle at B in triangle BGC is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle BGC has angles:

At B: 90°, at G: angle3, and at C: angle at C between B and G, which is angle BCG. Sum of angles is 180°, so:

angle3 + 90° + angle BCG = 180 => angle BCG = 90° - angle3.

But angle BCG is part of angle BCD (angle8). Since angle BCD is at point C between B and D. If G is on CD, then angle BCG is part of angle BCD. So, angle BCD (angle8) = angle BCG + angle GCD. But angle GCD is the angle at C between G and D. Since G is on CD, angle GCD is zero? Wait, no. If G is on CD, then CG is a part of CD, so angle between CG and CD is zero. Wait, this is confusing. Let me rephrase.

If point G is on line CD, then from point C, line CG goes towards G, which is on CD. So, angle BCG is the angle at C between B and G. Since G is on CD, angle BCG is the same as angle BCD if G were at D. But since G is somewhere on CD, angle BCG is part of angle BCD. Therefore, angle8 (angle BCD) = angle BCG + angle GCD. But angle GCD is the angle at C between G and D. Wait, but G is on CD, so angle between CG and CD is zero. Wait, no. From point C, line CG is going towards G, and CD extends from C through D. So, if G is between C and D, then angle between CG and CD is zero because CG is part of CD. Hence, angle BCG is equal to angle BCD (angle8). Therefore, angle BCG = angle8. But earlier, from triangle BGC, angle BCG = 90° - angle3. Therefore:

angle8 = 90° - angle3 → angle3 = 90° - angle8. Equation 3: angle3 = 90° - angle8.

Hmm, interesting. So angle3 and angle8 are supplementary? Not necessarily, but their relationship is defined by this equation.

Now, moving back to other parts. Let me check if I can find relations between other angles.

We also have ∠AGE = 104°, which is at point G between A and E. So, in triangle AGE, we have angle at G as 104°, and perhaps other angles can be determined if we can find relations.

But to find those, we need to figure out other angles in triangle AGE. For instance, angle at A and angle at E.

∠AGE is at G: 104°, angle at A is ∠GAE, and angle at E is ∠AEG.

But where is point E? It's on line BF and CD. Let me think about line BF. Since E is on BF, and we have angle ABE (angle5) and angle FBC (angle6), which sum to 90°. Also, there's ∠FEC = 40°, which is at E between F and C.

So, in triangle FEC, angle at E is 40°, and we might relate angles at F and C. But again, without more info, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe considering that line GE connects G to E. Since G is on BA, and E is on CD, so GE is a line connecting those two points. Also, since E is on BF, which connects B to F. So, maybe there are some similar triangles or cyclic quadrilaterals?

Alternatively, perhaps considering the entire configuration and trying to find relations between the angles.

Let me recap what I have so far:

From triangle ADG:

angle1 + angle2 = 144°. (Equation 1)

From triangle BGC:

angle3 = 90° - angle8. (Equation 3)

From angle ABC being 90°, angle5 + angle6 = 90°. (Equation 2)

In triangle CEB:

angle7 + angle6 + angle at C = 180°, where angle at C is angle BCE. Earlier, we thought angle BCE = angle8, but that might not hold. Wait, angle BCE is part of angle BCD (angle8). If E is on CD, then angle BCE is the same as angle BCD only if E coincides with D. But since E is on CD and also on BF, E could be between C and D or extended. Assuming general position, E is between C and D, so angle BCE is less than angle BCD. So, angle BCE = angle8 - something. But without more info, this is unclear. Maybe not helpful yet.

Back to triangle AGE. Let me think about it. If I can find ∠GAE or ∠AEG, then I can use the angle sum.

∠GAE is at point A between G and E. Since G is on BA, and E is on BF. So, ∠GAE is part of angle at A between BA and AE. But angle at A between BA and AE is ∠BAE, which is angle5? Wait, no. ∠BAE is angle at A between B and E. Given that ∠ABE is angle5, which is at B. Wait, confusion arises here.

Wait, angle ∠ABE is at point B between A and E. Whereas ∠BAE is at point A between B and E. These are different angles. To find ∠BAE, we might need more information.

Alternatively, since point E is on BF, and we have ∠FEC = 40°, which is at E between F and C. Perhaps considering triangle FEC. In triangle FEC, angles are at F, E, and C. We know angle at E is 40°, and if we can find other angles...

But maybe this approach isn't leading anywhere quickly. Let me think differently. Are there any cyclic quadrilaterals or other properties?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of all angles around a point is 360°, or around a line is 180°.

For instance, at point G, which is on BA and CD, there are four angles formed by the intersection of BA and CD. Those angles include angle3 (between C and B), angle at G between C and D, etc. Wait, but since BA and CD intersect at G, the vertical angles would be equal. Also, the adjacent angles are supplementary.

So, the angle between BA and CD at G is angle3 (between C and B), and the opposite angle would also be angle3. The other two angles at G would be supplementary to angle3. So, if angle3 is x, then the opposite angle is x, and the other two angles are 180 - x. But I'm not sure how this helps yet.

But maybe considering that line BA is perpendicular to BC, and line CD passes through G. So, if I can find the slope or orientation of CD relative to BA, but this might be too abstract without coordinates.

Alternatively, assigning coordinates to points to calculate angles numerically. Let me try that approach.

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and assuming standard coordinate system, let me define:

- Let’s take point B at (0,0).

- Since AB is perpendicular to BC, suppose AB is along the positive y-axis and BC is along the positive x-axis. So, point A is somewhere along the y-axis, and point C is along the x-axis.

Let me assign coordinates:

- Let’s assume AB is vertical. So, point B is at (0,0), point A is at (0, a) for some a > 0.

- BC is horizontal, so point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0.

Now, point G is on BA and CD. Since BA is the line from B(0,0) to A(0,a), so any point on BA has x-coordinate 0. Therefore, point G is somewhere on BA, so its coordinates are (0, g) for some g between 0 and a, or extended.

Also, point G lies on CD. So, line CD connects points C(c, 0) and D. But we don't know D yet. However, since E is on CD and BF, and E is also on CG. Wait, point E is on line CD and line CG. Since G is on CD, line CG is the same as line CD? No, because G is on CD, so line CG is part of CD. So, line CG is the same as line CD. Therefore, point E is on line CD and on line CG. But since E is on line CG (which is CD), and also on BF. Therefore, E is the intersection of BF and CD.

So, with coordinates, let me attempt to model this.

Let me proceed step by step:

Coordinates:

- B: (0, 0)

- A: (0, a)

- C: (c, 0)

- G: (0, g) since it's on BA.

Now, line CD passes through C(c, 0) and D. Let me denote D as some point. But since E is on CD, and also on BF, and E is also on CG (which is line CD), so E is the intersection of CD and BF. Let me define F as well. Since E is on BF, and ∠FEC = 40°, which is at E between F and C. So, point F is somewhere such that line BF connects B(0,0) to F, and E is on BF.

But without knowing exact positions, this might get complex. However, maybe I can assign coordinates to E and find relations.

Let me suppose that line BF has some slope, and E is a point on it. Let me parameterize BF. Let me assume F has coordinates (f_x, f_y). Then line BF goes from (0,0) to (f_x, f_y). Point E is somewhere on BF, so coordinates of E can be expressed as t*(f_x, f_y) for some parameter t.

But this seems too vague. Maybe instead, I can find expressions for angles in terms of coordinates.

Alternatively, since we know some angles, like ∠AGE = 104°, and ∠ADG = 36°, maybe I can compute slopes and use trigonometry.

But this might take time. Let me try to focus on what we can derive from existing equations.

Recall that in triangle ADG, angle1 + angle2 = 144°. So if I can find angle1 or angle2, I can find the other. But angle1 is ∠DGA, which is the angle at G between D and A. Since G is on BA and CD, and D is on CD. So, line GD is part of CD. Therefore, angle DGA is the angle at G between D and A. Since G is on BA, and D is on CD. So, this angle depends on the direction of CD relative to BA.

But since BA is perpendicular to BC, and CD passes through G, which is on BA. So, the line CD makes some angle with BA, and thus affects the angle at G between D and A.

But without knowing the exact position of D, it's difficult. However, perhaps using the other given angles.

Let me recall that ∠AGE = 104°. This angle is at G between A and E. So, in triangle AGE, we have angle at G as 104°, and if we can find other angles...

But to find those, we need relations involving points A, G, E. Since E is on BF and CD, and also on CG (which is CD). So, E is on CD and BF.

Let me consider line CD. Since G is on CD, and E is also on CD, so line CD contains both G and E. Thus, points C, G, E, D are colinear in some order. Depending on where E is located.

Assuming that E is between C and G or G and D, or beyond. Without loss of generality, let me assume that E is between C and G. But this is just an assumption; maybe it's better to keep it general.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should consider that the total of angles around point G adds up to 360°. At point G, we have four angles formed by lines BA, CD, and possibly others. Wait, at point G, lines BA and CD intersect, creating two pairs of vertical angles. One pair is angle3 (between C and B) and its vertical angle. The other pair is the supplement to angle3. 

Since angle3 is at G between C and B (i.e., between GC and GB), and the opposite angle is also angle3. The other two angles at G are supplementary to angle3. So, those angles are 180° - angle3.

Now, among these angles, one of them is ∠AGD, which is angle2? Wait, no. ∠AGD is the angle at G between A and D. Wait, ∠(A, G, D) is at G between A and D. So, this is one of the angles at G. Let me see.

At point G, the lines are BA (which includes points B and A) and CD (which includes points C and D). So, the four angles at G are:

1. Between BA and CD, on one side: angle3 (between C and B).

2. Its vertical angle (also angle3).

3. The other two angles are between BA and CD on the opposite side. So, these are supplementary to angle3.

Now, ∠AGD is the angle at G between A and D. Since A is on BA, and D is on CD. So, depending on the direction, this angle could be one of the supplementary angles.

Assume that angle between BA and CD at G is angle3. Then, the other angles at G are 180° - angle3. Now, ∠AGD is one of these angles. Let me visualize: from point G, line GA is along BA (since G is on BA), and line GD is along CD (since G is on CD). So, the angle between GA (along BA) and GD (along CD) is either angle3 or 180° - angle3, depending on which side you're measuring.

But since angle3 is between GC and GB (which is BA), then the angle between GD and GA would depend on the direction of GD. If D is on the same side as C relative to G, then the angle between GD and GA would be supplementary to angle3.

Wait, let's say that at point G, line CD passes through G, with C on one side and D on the other. So, from G, going along CD, we go towards C and D. If we consider the angle between GA (which is along BA) and GD (along CD away from C), then this angle would be the supplementary angle to angle3.

Thus, ∠AGD (angle2) is equal to 180° - angle3. Therefore, angle2 = 180° - angle3.

But from earlier, in triangle BGC, angle3 = 90° - angle8. So, substituting:

angle2 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8.

So, angle2 = 90° + angle8. Equation 4: angle2 = 90° + angle8.

But we need to find angle2. So, if we can find angle8, we can compute angle2. How?

Angle8 is ∠BCD, which is the angle at C between B and D. Earlier, we considered that angle BCD = angle8 = angle BCG + something. But earlier, we thought angle BCG = 90° - angle3, and if angle8 = angle BCG, then angle8 = 90° - angle3. But that led us to angle3 = 90° - angle8. But if angle8 is actually larger than angle BCG, then that relationship changes. 

Wait, let me revisit this. In triangle BGC, we said that angle BCG = 90° - angle3. But angle BCG is part of angle BCD (angle8). If point G is between C and D, then angle BCG is part of angle BCD, so angle8 = angle BCG + angle GCD. But angle GCD is the angle at C between G and D. Since G is on CD, this angle is zero? No, because G is on CD, so from point C, line CG is along CD towards G, and CD continues to D. So, angle between CG and CD is zero, meaning that angle BCD is just angle BCG. Wait, no. If G is on CD, then from point C, the line CD extends through G to D. So, angle BCD is the angle between CB and CD. Since G is on CD, angle BCG is the same as angle BCD. Therefore, angle BCG = angle8. Hence, from triangle BGC:

angle BCG = 90° - angle3 ⇒ angle8 = 90° - angle3 ⇒ angle3 = 90° - angle8.

Which gives us angle2 = 90° + angle8. So, angle2 = 90° + angle8.

Now, we need to find angle8. How?

Let me think about other angles. Let's look at triangle CEB. Earlier, we had in triangle CEB:

angle7 + angle6 + angle at C = 180°, where angle at C is angle BCE. But if angle BCE = angle8, then:

angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°. Equation 5: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°.

But from earlier, we have angle5 + angle6 = 90° (equation 2). So, if we can relate angle7 and angle5?

Looking at other angles. There's ∠ABE = angle5, which is at B between A and E. Also, ∠CEB = angle7, which is at E between C and B. Maybe there's a way to relate angle5 and angle7 through some triangle or other relations.

Consider triangle ABE. Wait, point E is on BF, so maybe triangle ABE? Let me see.

In triangle ABE, we have angle at B: angle5, angle at A: ?, and angle at E: ?. But without knowing more angles, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, consider triangle BEC. Wait, we already did that. Or triangle BEA?

Alternatively, since E is on BF, and we know ∠FEC = 40°, which is at E between F and C. So, in triangle FEC, angle at E is 40°, and angle at C is angle ECF, angle at F is angle EFC.

But again, without more info, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the sum of angles around point E. At point E, there are several angles. For example, ∠FEC = 40°, ∠CEB = angle7, and maybe others.

Since E is on BF and CD, and also on CG (which is CD), so line EF is part of BF, and line EC is part of CD. So, at point E, the lines are EC (along CD) and EF (along BF). So, the angle between EC and EF is ∠CEF = 40°, which is given. Also, ∠CEB = angle7 is the angle between EC and EB. Since EB is part of BF, so angle between EC and EB is angle7. 

Therefore, at point E, the angles around E include:

- ∠CEF = 40° (between C and F)

- ∠CEB = angle7 (between C and B)

- And possibly others if there are other lines meeting at E.

But since E is on BF and CD, the lines at E are BF and CD. So, the angles around E on those lines are:

- On line CD: angle between EC and ED (but we don't know ED).

- On line BF: angle between EB and EF.

But since we have ∠CEF = 40° and ∠CEB = angle7, and assuming that lines CD and BF intersect at E, then the sum of angles around E on those lines should be 180°, since they form a straight line.

Wait, no. At point E, the lines BF and CD intersect, forming vertical angles. The angles around E would be:

- ∠CEB (angle7) and ∠FEA (assuming A is on BF?), but I need to clarify.

Actually, since E is on BF, and on CD. So, at point E, the lines are:

- Line BF, which has points B-E-F.

- Line CD, which has points C-E-D.

So, at point E, the lines BF and CD cross, creating four angles. Among them, ∠CEF = 40° (between C and F), and ∠CEB = angle7 (between C and B). The other two angles would be supplementary to these. 

So, the sum of angles around point E should be 360°, but since they are formed by two intersecting lines, the sum of adjacent angles is 180°. Specifically, ∠CEF + ∠CEB = 180°, because they are adjacent angles on line BF. Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

At point E, on line BF, we have angle between CE and EB (which is angle7), and on line CD, we have angle between CE and EF (which is 40°). These two angles (angle7 and 40°) are adjacent, forming a linear pair? No, because they are on different lines. Wait, the lines BF and CD intersect at E. So, the angles around E are:

- ∠CEF (between C and F): 40°

- ∠CEB (between C and B): angle7

- ∠BEF (between B and F): ?

- ∠DEF (between D and F): ?

But since lines BF and CD intersect at E, the vertical angles are ∠CEF and ∠DEB, and ∠CEB and ∠DFE. 

But since we know ∠CEF = 40°, then its vertical angle is ∠DEB = 40°. Also, ∠CEB = angle7, so its vertical angle is ∠DFE = angle7. 

Now, considering that on line BF, the angles at E should add up to 180°. So, ∠CEB (angle7) and ∠CEF (40°) are on different lines. Wait, no. Along line BF, the angles at E are ∠BEF and ∠CEB? No, along line BF, the angles at E are between BE and EF. But since line CD passes through E, we have ∠CEB and ∠CEF. 

Actually, it's clearer to use the fact that the sum of angles around point E on the intersecting lines BF and CD is 360°. But since we have two angles: 40° and angle7, and their supplements. 

Alternatively, focusing on the fact that ∠CEB (angle7) and ∠CEF (40°) are adjacent angles at E, forming a straight line? No, because they are on different lines. Wait, if you look at line CD, it has points C-E-D, and line BF has points B-E-F. So, at point E, the lines CD and BF cross, creating four angles. The angles are:

- Between CB and CE (angle7)

- Between CE and EF (40°)

- Between EF and ED (unknown)

- Between ED and EC (unknown)

Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point E is 360°. So:

∠CEF (40°) + ∠CEB (angle7) + ∠BEF + ∠DEF = 360°. But without knowing ∠BEF and ∠DEF, it's hard to proceed. However, if we consider that ∠BEF is part of line BF, and ∠DEF is part of line CD. 

Alternatively, since line BF passes through E, the angles on one side of BF at E are ∠CEB (angle7) and ∠CEF (40°), which are on different lines. Maybe using the fact that the sum of angles on one side of BF is 180°? 

Wait, along line BF, the angles at E are on both sides. For example, on one side of BF, we have ∠CEB (angle7) and on the other side, ∠CEF (40°). But these are not on the same line. 

I think this path is too tangled. Let me return to previous equations.

We had:

From triangle CEB: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180° (Equation 5)

From earlier, angle5 + angle6 = 90° (Equation 2)

If we can relate angle5 and angle7, perhaps through another triangle.

Let me think about triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, we have angle at B: angle5, angle at A: ?, and angle at E: ?. Let me try to find relations here.

But what is the angle at E in triangle ABE? It is ∠AEB, which is the angle at E between A and B. Since E is on BF, and we have ∠CEB = angle7, which is at E between C and B. So, ∠AEB is adjacent to ∠CEB if points A, E, and C are aligned in some way. Wait, not necessarily. 

Wait, point A is on BA, and E is on BF. So, unless A, E, and C are collinear, which they aren't, unless specified. So, ∠AEB is a separate angle. 

However, we might relate ∠AEB with ∠CEB. Since E is on BF, and line EA connects E to A. So, from point E, lines EA, EB, and EC are present. So, the angles at E are:

- Between EA and EB: ∠AEB

- Between EB and EC: ∠CEB = angle7

- Between EC and EA: ?

But unless we know more, it's hard to relate. 

Alternatively, considering triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we have angles at A, E, and C. But without knowing more, not helpful.

Wait, but we know ∠AGE = 104°, which is at G between A and E. So, if I can find ∠AGE in terms of other angles. Let me consider triangle AGE. 

In triangle AGE, we have:

- ∠AGE = 104° (given)

- ∠GAE = ?

- ∠AEG = ?

If I can find two of these angles, I can find the third. 

To find ∠GAE, which is at A between G and E. Since G is on BA, and E is on BF. So, ∠GAE is part of angle at A between BA and AE. 

But angle at A between BA and AE is ∠BAE, which is angle5? No, angle5 is ∠ABE, which is at B. 

Wait, ∠BAE is at A between B and E. So, if I can find ∠BAE, that would help. 

But how? Let me think about triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, we have angle at B: angle5, angle at A: ∠BAE, and angle at E: ∠AEB. Sum is 180°, so:

angle5 + ∠BAE + ∠AEB = 180°. 

But I still don't know ∠AEB or ∠BAE. 

However, if I can relate ∠AEB with other angles. 

At point E, we have ∠AEB and ∠CEB (angle7). Since E is on BF, and line EC is part of CD. So, if I consider line EA and line EC, they form an angle at E. 

But this is too vague. 

Let me think about the total of angles around point A. At point A, we have several angles:

- ∠BAG (which is part of angle at A between BA and GA, since G is on BA)

- ∠GAD (which is angle2, since ∠GAD is at A between G and D)

- ∠DAE (if E is near D)

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, since we know ∠AGE = 104°, and ∠AGD = angle2, and ∠ADG = 36°, perhaps using the law of sines or cosines in triangle AGD? But without lengths, this might not work.

Wait, in triangle AGD, we have:

∠ADG = 36° (at D)

∠DGA = angle1 (at G)

∠GAD = angle2 (at A)

And we have angle1 + angle2 = 144° (from before).

But if I can find another relation involving angle1 or angle2, I can solve.

Earlier, we derived angle2 = 90° + angle8. And from equation 5: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°.

Also, from equation 2: angle5 + angle6 = 90°.

If we can relate angle5 and angle7, perhaps through another relation.

Let me think about triangle AGB. Wait, G is on BA, so triangle AGB is degenerate? No, because G is on BA, so it's just a line segment. Not helpful.

Wait, but ∠AGE = 104°, which is at G between A and E. So, in triangle AGE, we have:

∠AGE = 104°, ∠GAE = ?, ∠AEG = ?

If I can find ∠GAE or ∠AEG, I can find the third.

Let me try to find ∠AEG. At point E, ∠AEG is the angle between A and G. Since E is on BF and CD, and G is on BA and CD. So, line EG connects E to G. 

If I can find ∠AEG in terms of other angles. 

But I don't have direct info. However, considering that ∠AEG is part of ∠AEB or ∠AEC, depending on the location of G and E.

Alternatively, using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle AGE is 180°, so:

∠AGE + ∠GAE + ∠AEG = 180°

=> 104° + ∠GAE + ∠AEG = 180°

=> ∠GAE + ∠AEG = 76°

But without additional info, this is not enough.

But maybe relating ∠GAE and ∠AEG with other angles. For example, ∠GAE is part of ∠BAE, which is in triangle ABE. And ∠AEG is part of ∠AEB, which is in triangle ABE. 

But again, without knowing more, it's stuck.

Let me try to summarize what we have:

1. angle1 + angle2 = 144°
2. angle5 + angle6 = 90°
3. angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°
4. angle2 = 90° + angle8

From equation 4: angle8 = angle2 - 90°

Substituting into equation 3: angle7 + angle6 + (angle2 - 90°) = 180°  
=> angle7 + angle6 + angle2 = 270°

But from equation 2: angle5 + angle6 = 90°, so angle6 = 90° - angle5

Substitute into above: angle7 + (90° - angle5) + angle2 = 270°  
=> angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180°

Now, if we can relate angle7 and angle5, we can find angle2.

How?

Maybe through triangle ABE or another triangle. Let's think about ∠ABE = angle5 and ∠CEB = angle7. Is there a way these angles are related?

If I consider line AE, which connects A to E. At point E, we have ∠AEB and ∠CEB (angle7). Also, ∠AEB is part of triangle ABE, and ∠CEB is part of triangle CEB. 

But how to relate ∠AEB and ∠CEB?

If I consider line AE and line CE, they meet at E. So, the angle between AE and CE is ∠AEC. This angle could be related to other angles.

But ∠AEC is at E between A and C. Which is composed of ∠AEB + ∠BEC, if points A, B, C are arranged appropriately. Wait, if E is on BF, and B is on BA, then ∠AEC is made up of ∠AEB and ∠BEC. 

Yes! At point E, the angle between A and C is ∠AEC, which is equal to ∠AEB + ∠BEC. 

But ∠BEC is angle7, and ∠AEB is part of triangle ABE. 

So, ∠AEC = ∠AEB + angle7.

But ∠AEC is also part of triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we have angles at A, E, and C. 

But without knowing more about triangle AEC, it's still abstract. However, if we can find ∠AEC in another way.

Alternatively, since we know ∠AGE = 104°, which is at G between A and E. So, line GE forms this angle. If we can relate ∠AGE with ∠AEC or other angles.

Alternatively, considering that points A, G, E are connected, and line GE creates angle104° at G. If I can find relations between ∠GAE and ∠AEG with other angles.

Let me recall that in triangle AGE, ∠GAE + ∠AEG = 76°, as derived earlier. If I can express these angles in terms of other known quantities.

∠GAE is the angle at A between G and E, which is part of ∠BAE. And ∠AEG is the angle at E between A and G, which is part of ∠AEC.

But this is too vague. 

Wait, let me think about the total of angles at point A. At point A, we have several angles:

- ∠BAG: since G is on BA, this is zero, because G is on BA.

Wait, no. At point A, the angles would involve lines coming from A. For example, ∠GAD (angle2), ∠BAE (which is ∠GAE + ∠GAB?), but since G is on BA, ∠GAB is zero. So, ∠BAE is the same as ∠GAE.

So, ∠BAE = ∠GAE. 

From earlier, in triangle ABE, ∠BAE + ∠ABE + ∠AEB = 180°  
=> ∠GAE + angle5 + ∠AEB = 180°

But we also have from earlier, ∠AEC = ∠AEB + angle7  
And ∠AEC is also the angle at E between A and C. 

If I can relate ∠AEC with other angles. 

But ∠AEC is part of triangle AEC, and also, if I consider line EC, which is part of CD. 

But without knowing more, it's still stuck. 

Wait, let me try to combine the equations I have:

From earlier, we have:

angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180° (from combining equations 2, 3, and 4)

If I can find angle7 - angle5, then I can solve for angle2.

But how?

Let me think about triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we have angles at A, E, and C. Let's denote:

- At A: ∠CAE = ∠GAE (since G is on BA, and ∠CAE is the angle at A between C and E, which is the same as ∠GAE if G is on BA. Wait, no. ∠CAE is at A between C and E. But G is on BA, so unless C is aligned with G, which it isn't. So, this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, if I can find ∠AEC in terms of other angles. 

But I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should try to assign numerical values to some angles based on assumptions.

Let me assume that angle8 is some value, say x. Then, from equation4, angle2 = 90 + x. 

From equation3, angle7 + angle6 + x = 180°

From equation2, angle5 + angle6 = 90°

From the earlier combined equation: angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180°

Substituting angle2 = 90 + x:

angle7 - angle5 + 90 + x = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + x = 90

But from equation3: angle7 + angle6 + x = 180, and from equation2: angle6 = 90 - angle5. Substituting into equation3:

angle7 + (90 - angle5) + x = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + x = 90

Which matches the previous equation. So, this doesn't give new info. 

This suggests that we need another equation to solve for angle2. 

Let me think about the given angle ∠AGE = 104°, which is in triangle AGE. If I can find ∠GAE or ∠AEG in terms of other angles, I can use the triangle angle sum.

Let me assume that ∠GAE = y and ∠AEG = z, so that y + z = 76° (from earlier).

Now, ∠GAE = y is part of ∠BAE in triangle ABE. And ∠AEB = 180° - y - angle5.

Also, ∠AEC = ∠AEB + angle7 = (180° - y - angle5) + angle7.

But ∠AEC is also part of triangle AEC, and if I can relate it to other angles. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠AEC is supplementary to ∠AED if D is aligned in a certain way. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, since D is on CD, and we have ∠ADG = 36°, which is at D between A and G. 

But this is getting too abstract. 

Wait, let me recall that in triangle ADG, we have angle1 + angle2 = 144°, and angle1 is ∠DGA. Earlier, we thought angle1 is supplementary to angle3, but let me verify.

At point G, angle1 is ∠DGA, which is the angle at G between D and A. Since G is on BA and CD, this angle is either angle3 or its supplement. As discussed earlier, if angle3 is the angle between C and B at G, then the angle between D and A at G is supplementary to angle3. So, angle1 = 180° - angle3. 

From earlier, angle3 = 90° - angle8. So, angle1 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8. 

So, angle1 = 90° + angle8. 

Now, from equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°  
Substituting angle1 = 90° + angle8 and angle2 = 90° + angle8 (from earlier):

(90° + angle8) + (90° + angle8) = 144°  
=> 180° + 2*angle8 = 144°  
=> 2*angle8 = -36°  
=> angle8 = -18°

This is impossible, as angles cannot be negative. This suggests a mistake in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Let me review. Earlier, I assumed that angle1 = 180° - angle3. Let me re-examine this.

At point G, the angle between GA (which is along BA) and GD (along CD) is angle1. This angle could be either angle3 or its supplement, depending on the orientation.

Previously, I assumed that angle1 is supplementary to angle3, but this might be incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Angle3 is the angle at G between C and B, which is the angle between GC and GB. Since G is on BA, GB is along BA. So, angle3 is the angle between GC (part of CD) and GB (along BA). 

The angle between GD (along CD) and GA (along BA) is angle1. Depending on the direction of CD relative to BA, this angle could be angle3 or its supplement.

If CD is on the same side as CB relative to BA, then angle1 could be angle3. Otherwise, it's supplementary.

But since AB is perpendicular to BC, and CD passes through G, which is on BA. Let me try to draw this.

Imagine BA is vertical, BC is horizontal. G is on BA. Line CD passes through G. If CD is such that it goes from C (on BC) through G to D. The angle between CD and BA at G is angle3, which is between GC and GB (which is BA). The angle between GD (along CD) and GA (along BA) is angle1. If D is on the same side as C, then the angle between GD and GA would be the same as angle3, or supplementary?

If G is between C and D, then from point G, line GD goes in the opposite direction from GC. So, the angle between GD and GA would be supplementary to angle3. Hence, angle1 = 180° - angle3.

But earlier, this led to an inconsistency. Let me check the calculation again.

If angle1 = 180° - angle3, and angle3 = 90° - angle8, then angle1 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8.

Then, from equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°  
Substituting angle1 = 90° + angle8 and angle2 = 90° + angle8 (from earlier), we get:

(90 + angle8) + (90 + angle8) = 144  
=> 180 + 2angle8 = 144  
=> 2angle8 = -36  
=> angle8 = -18°, which is impossible.

This indicates a mistake in the assumption that angle2 = 90° + angle8. Where is the error?

Let me revisit the earlier step where I concluded angle2 = 90° + angle8. 

I said that at point G, angle between GA (along BA) and GD (along CD) is angle1 or angle2. Wait, angle2 is ∠GAD, which is at A, not at G. Wait, no! Angle2 is ∠GAD, which is at A between G and D. Earlier, I confused angle1 and angle2. Let me clarify.

 angle1 is ∠DGA, which is at G between D and A. 

 angle2 is ∠GAD, which is at A between G and D.

So, earlier, when I said angle2 = 90° + angle8, that was incorrect. Let me re-express.

From triangle BGC, we had angle3 = 90° - angle8.

At point G, angle between GA (along BA) and GD (along CD) is angle1 = ∠DGA. This angle is either angle3 or its supplement. If angle3 is the angle between GC and GB, then angle1 is the angle between GD and GA, which is supplementary to angle3 if GD is on the opposite side of CD from GC. So, angle1 = 180° - angle3 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8.

So, angle1 = 90° + angle8.

From equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°  
So, (90 + angle8) + angle2 = 144  
=> angle2 = 144 - 90 - angle8 = 54 - angle8. 

Ah! Here was the mistake: previously, I incorrectly stated angle2 = 90 + angle8, but it should be angle2 = 54 - angle8. 

Now, this makes sense. Let me correct that.

So, angle2 = 54 - angle8. 

Now, let's revisit the earlier equation from combining equations 2, 3, and 4:

We had angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180°

And from equation2: angle5 + angle6 = 90°

From equation3: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°

Now, with angle2 = 54 - angle8, let's substitute into the equation:

angle7 - angle5 + (54 - angle8) = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126

From equation3: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180  
From equation2: angle6 = 90 - angle5

Substitute angle6 into equation3:  
angle7 + (90 - angle5) + angle8 = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90  

Now, from the previous equation: angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126  
Let me write both equations:

1. angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90  
2. angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126  

Let me subtract equation2 from equation1:

( angle7 - angle5 + angle8 ) - ( angle7 - angle5 - angle8 ) = 90 - 126  
=> 2angle8 = -36  
=> angle8 = -18°, which is still impossible. 

This indicates another contradiction, suggesting an error in assumptions.

Where is the mistake now? Let me check the steps again.

First, angle1 = 90 + angle8, from angle1 = 180 - angle3 = 180 - (90 - angle8) = 90 + angle8.

From equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144° => angle2 = 144 - angle1 = 144 - (90 + angle8) = 54 - angle8.

Correct.

Then, from combining equations, we had:

angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180°  
=> angle7 - angle5 + (54 - angle8) = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126°

From equation3: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°, and angle6 = 90 - angle5, so:

angle7 + (90 - angle5) + angle8 = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90°

Now, we have:

1. angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126°  
2. angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90°

Adding these two equations:

2(angle7 - angle5) = 216°  
=> angle7 - angle5 = 108°

Subtracting equation2 from equation1:

2angle8 = 126 - 90 = 36°  
=> angle8 = 18°

Now, angle8 = 18°, which is valid.

Now, from equation2: angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90°  
=> angle7 - angle5 + 18 = 90  
=> angle7 - angle5 = 72°

From earlier, we also have angle7 - angle5 = 108°, which contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, when we added the two equations:

From equation1: angle7 - angle5 - angle8 = 126  
From equation2: angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90  
Adding: 2(angle7 - angle5) = 216 => angle7 - angle5 = 108°

But from equation2: angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90°, and angle8 = 18°, so:

angle7 - angle5 + 18 = 90 => angle7 - angle5 = 72°

Contradiction: angle7 - angle5 = 108° and 72° simultaneously. This is impossible, indicating another error.

This suggests that there is a flaw in the assumptions. Let me trace back.

The error likely comes from the assumption about angle1 = 90 + angle8. Let me re-examine that.

At point G, angle1 is ∠DGA, which is the angle at G between D and A. This angle is either angle3 or its supplement. If angle3 is the angle between GC and GB, and angle1 is between GD and GA, then depending on the direction of GD, it could be supplementary to angle3.

But if angle3 is the angle between GC and GB, then the angle between GD and GA would depend on whether GD is on the same side as GC or opposite.

If G is on BA and CD, and assuming that D is on the same side of CD as C, then the angle between GD and GA would be supplementary to angle3. Hence, angle1 = 180° - angle3 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8.

But this leads to contradictions in the equations, suggesting that this assumption is wrong.

Alternative possibility: angle1 is equal to angle3. Let me try that.

If angle1 = angle3, then from equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°  
=> angle3 + angle2 = 144°

From earlier, angle3 = 90° - angle8. So:

90° - angle8 + angle2 = 144°  
=> angle2 = 54° + angle8

Now, let's revisit the previous equations.

From equation2: angle5 + angle6 = 90°

From equation3: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°

From the combined equation: angle7 - angle5 + angle2 = 180°

Substituting angle2 = 54 + angle8:

angle7 - angle5 + 54 + angle8 = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 126°

From equation3: angle7 + angle6 + angle8 = 180°, and angle6 = 90 - angle5, so:

angle7 + (90 - angle5) + angle8 = 180  
=> angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90°

Now, we have:

1. angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 90° (from equation3 and 2)
2. angle7 - angle5 + angle8 = 126° (from combined equation)

This is a contradiction, implying that even this assumption is wrong.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the relationship between angle1 and angle3 is incorrect.

Let me rethink the relationship between angle1 and angle3.

At point G, angle3 is the angle between GC and GB (which is BA). The angle1 is the angle between GD and GA (which is BA). Since G is on CD, GD is part of CD. So, if I consider the line CD, it passes through G, with C on one side and D on the other. The angle between GC and GB is angle3, and the angle between GD and GA is angle1. These two angles are on different sides of CD, so they are supplementary. Hence, angle3 + angle1 = 180°.

Wait, this is a crucial point! At point G, the lines CG and GD are on the same line CD, so the angle between CG and GB (angle3) and the angle between GD and GA (angle1) are supplementary. Hence, angle3 + angle1 = 180°.

Therefore, angle1 = 180° - angle3.

From earlier, angle3 = 90° - angle8, so angle1 = 180° - (90° - angle8) = 90° + angle8.

Now, from equation1: angle1 + angle2 = 144°  
=> (90° + angle8) + angle2 = 144°  
=> angle2 = 144° - 90° - angle
