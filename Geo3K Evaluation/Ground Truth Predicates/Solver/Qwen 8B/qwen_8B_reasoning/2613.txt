MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several geometric constraints here, and we need to find the value of x. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

First, there are some angle and arc measures mentioned. The measure of angle C-B-D is equal to x + 2.5 degrees. Then, the measure of arc G-D is 50 degrees, and arc C-D is 4x + 5 degrees. There are also points lying on lines and circles, which probably relate to the positions of these points and maybe inscribed angles or something like that.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Points A, B, C, D, E, G are involved. Since points C, D, G lie on the same circle centered at A (since they're on Circle(A, radius_0_0)), so that means A is the center of the circle passing through C, D, G. Wait, but point L lies on line BC? Or wait, the PointLiesOnLine statements say:

- G lies on line BC
- C lies on line BE
- G lies on line BE
- C lies on line EG
Wait, that might mean that points B, E, G are colinear because C is on BE and G is on BE as well? Also, since C is on line BE and G is on line BE, then points B, C, E, G are all on the same line? But also, G is on line BC? Wait, no. Let me parse each constraint carefully.

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, C)): So point G is on line BC. That would mean that G is somewhere along the line connecting B and C. But another constraint says PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B, E)) meaning that point C is on line BE. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, E)) implies that G is on line BE. And PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(E, G)) suggests that point C is on line EG. Hmm, this seems a bit conflicting unless all those points are arranged in a certain way.

Let me try to visualize this. Let me note that points B, C, E, and G are connected in some way. If C is on line BE, and G is on line BE, then both C and G are on BE. Also, G is on line BC. So if G is on line BC and also on line BE, then lines BC and BE intersect at point G. Therefore, point G is the intersection of lines BC and BE. Which would imply that points B, C, E, G are arranged such that B is connected to C and E, and G is a point where BC meets BE. Wait, but if G is on BC, then it's between B and C or extended beyond?

Also, since C is on line EG, meaning that line EG passes through point C. So line EG connects E and G, and passes through C. Given that G is on BE, so line EG connects E to G (which is on BE), so line EG is part of BE. Hence, point C is on BE, so line EG is BE itself. Therefore, point C is on BE, which makes sense.

So putting this together, points B, C, E, G are colinear? Because C and G are on BE. So line BE contains points B, C, E, G. Wait, but G is also on line BC. So line BC intersects line BE at point G. Therefore, points B, C, G are colinear, and line BE passes through C and G. Therefore, the order of points on line BE could be B, then C, then G, or maybe different. But since G is on BC, then depending on direction, maybe G is between B and C or beyond C.

But perhaps it's better to think about the circle centered at A passing through C, D, G. So points C, D, G are on the circumference of the circle with center A. Therefore, AC = AD = AG, since they are radii of the circle. So triangle ACG, ADG, etc., are all isosceles triangles.

Now, the arcs mentioned: Arc GD is 50 degrees. Arc CD is 4x + 5 degrees. Also, angle at point B, angle C-B-D equals x + 2.5 degrees. So angle CBD is x + 2.5. Let me recall that angles formed by chords can relate to arcs. For instance, an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, angle CBD is formed by two chords: CB and BD. But I need to determine which arc it intercepts.

Alternatively, since points C, D, G are on the circle, and B is outside the circle (assuming that), because B is connected to C and G, which are on the circle. Wait, but B is connected to C and G, which are points on the circle. So B is outside the circle, and lines BC and BG are secants. Wait, but if G is on BC, then BG is a part of BC. So angle CBD is formed at point B, with segments BC and BD. So BD is another line from B to D, which is also on the circle.

Therefore, angle CBD is formed by two secants: BC and BD. The formula for the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So the measure of angle CBD should be equal to half the difference of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite.

In this case, angle CBD intercepts arcs CD and... Well, when two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, the angle is ½ (measure of larger arc - measure of smaller arc). 

The intercepted arcs would be the arc from C to D and the arc from G to something? Wait, let me recall the exact theorem. If two secants intersect at a point outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. In this case, angle at B, formed by secants BC and BD. The intercepted arcs would be arc CD and arc... the arc that's opposite, which would be arc CG? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have two secants from point B, going to points C and D on the circle, then the angle at B is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between C and D that's opposite the angle, and the arc that's... Wait, actually, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, the angle at B intercepts arc CD and the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc that's not containing the angle. Wait, perhaps more precisely, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So if the angle is formed by two secants, the angle is ½ (arc CD - arc CG?), depending on where the points are. Wait, maybe I need to consider the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants.

Alternatively, since the angle is formed by BA and BD? No, the angle is at point B, between BC and BD. So the two intercepted arcs would be arc from C to D that does not contain B, and the arc from C to D that does contain B? Wait, no. Actually, the angle formed outside the circle by two secants intercepts two arcs: the arc between the two points where the secants meet the circle. Wait, let me check.

Suppose you have a circle, and a point B outside the circle. From B, draw two secants: one passing through points C and G (since G is on BC) and another passing through D. Wait, but BD is another secant. Wait, but BD goes from B to D, so it's a single secant. Wait, but angle CBD is formed by BC and BD. So BC is a secant that goes from B through C to G (since G is on BC), and BD is another secant from B to D. Therefore, the two intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc CD? Or maybe arc CD and arc... Let me refer back to the formula.

The formula is: If two secants intersect at a point outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So in this case, the angle at B is formed by secant BC (which passes through C and G) and secant BD. So the intercepted arcs would be arc from C to D and arc from G to D? Wait, no. Wait, the two intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Each secant intercepts an arc. The first secant (BC) passes through C and G (but G is on the circle, so the arc from C to G? Wait, but the secant starts at B and passes through C and G. So the points where the secant meets the circle are C and G. The other secant is BD, which meets the circle at D. Wait, but BD starts at B and ends at D. So the intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc CD? Or maybe arc DG and arc something else?

Actually, according to the formula, the angle is half the difference between the measure of the arc that's farther away from the angle and the measure of the arc that's closer. So, the angle formed by two secants is ½ (far arc - near arc). So, in this case, the two intercepted arcs would be arc CD and arc CG? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the intercepted arcs would be arc from C to D and arc from G to D? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to think differently.

Since the angle is at point B, and the two secants are BC (going through C and G) and BD. So, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, the first secant (BG) passes through the circle at C and G. The second secant (BD) passes through D. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc CD. Wait, but how does that work? Maybe the angle is formed by two secants, so the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. Let me check an example.

For example, suppose you have two secants from B: one passes through C and G (so the points on the circle are C and G), and the other passes through D. Then, the intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc CD. Wait, but maybe the angle is related to arc CD and arc CG? Or perhaps the angle relates to the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Wait, the angle is formed by two secants, so the measure is half the difference between the intercepted arcs. So, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two secants. But since one secant has two points (C and G) and the other has one point (D), maybe the intercepted arcs are the arc between C and D and the arc between G and D? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at B intercepts arc CD and arc GD? Wait, but angle CBD is formed by BC and BD. So, starting at point B, going to C and D. So, the intercepted arcs would be arc CD (the arc from C to D not containing B) and arc... Well, the other arc would be the arc that's opposite, which may involve the other intersections. Wait, but since one secant goes through G, which is another point on the circle. So, maybe the angle is formed by BC and BD, and the intercepted arcs are arc CD and arc CG? Or arc CG and arc CD?

This is confusing. Maybe I need to use the formula properly. The formula states that the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, in this case, the two intercepted arcs would be the arc between the two points where the first secant meets the circle (which is arc CG) and the arc between the two points where the second secant meets the circle. But the second secant only meets the circle at D, so maybe it's considered as an arc from D to itself? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the second secant is BD, which goes from B to D, so the intercepted arc is from D to wherever? Wait, no. Wait, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, for two secants, each secant intercepts an arc. For the first secant (BC, which goes through C and G), the intercepted arc would be arc CG. For the second secant (BD), which goes from B to D, so the intercepted arc would be arc from D to... the other side? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the angle is formed by two secants, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, the angle is formed by two secants, and the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are not overlapping. So, the angle is ½ (arc CG - arc CD)? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by two secants, so the intercepted arcs are arc CD and arc CG. But I need to get this right. Let me look up the exact formula mentally. The measure of an angle formed outside the circle by two secants is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, if one secant passes through points C and G, and the other passes through D, then the intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc CD. Wait, but how do those arcs relate? Wait, no. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Each secant intercepts an arc. The first secant (from B through C and G) intercepts arc CG. The second secant (from B through D) intercepts arc... Well, since it's just one point, D. Wait, but that's not possible. Unless the second secant is extended to meet the circle again. But BD is a secant from B to D, so if D is on the circle, then BD is a tangent? No, because if D is on the circle, then BD is a secant that starts at B and ends at D. But since D is on the circle, BD is a tangent only if BD is perpendicular to the radius at D. But we don't know that.

Wait, but in our case, the angle is formed by two secants: one is BC (passing through C and G), and the other is BD. Since D is on the circle, BD is a secant that starts at B and ends at D. So, the intercepted arcs would be arc CG and arc... Well, the other arc that's intercepted by BD? But BD is just touching D, so it's a secant that only meets the circle once? No, a secant must meet the circle twice. Wait, BD starts at B and ends at D, which is on the circle. But does it pass through another point? If BD is a secant, then it must enter the circle at D and exit at another point. But since B is outside the circle, BD is a secant that starts at B, exits the circle at D, and then continues to... but since D is the only intersection point, that would make it a tangent. Wait, but if BD is a tangent, then it touches the circle at D. So, BD is a tangent. But earlier, we were told that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent. So maybe BD is a tangent?

If BD is a tangent, then the angle CBD would be formed by a tangent and a secant. Wait, but angle CBD is formed by BC (a secant) and BD (a tangent). Then, the measure of the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, the formula for an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, in this case, angle CBD is formed by a tangent (BD) and a secant (BC). The measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from the point of tangency (D) to the other intersection of the secant (which is C). So the angle is ½ (arc DC - arc ... ? Wait, no. The formula says that the measure is half the difference between the intercepted arc and the arc that's opposite. Wait, if the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arc. Specifically, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measure of the intercepted arc (between the point of tangency and the other intersection of the secant) and zero? No, wait. Let me recall the exact formula.

When an angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency and the secant's other intersection. So, in this case, the angle at B is formed by tangent BD and secant BC. The intercepted arc would be the arc from D to C that does not contain the point of tangency. Wait, but since BD is tangent at D, the angle is formed by BD (tangent) and BC (secant). The intercepted arcs would be arc DC and arc... Well, the formula is: angle = ½ (measure of intercepted arc - measure of the other arc). Wait, no. It's ½ (measure of intercepted arc). Wait, no. Let me check again.

The formula for the angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if the angle is formed by a tangent at D and a secant that intersects the circle at C and G, then the angle is ½ (arc DC - arc DG). Wait, but I need to clarify.

Alternatively, the angle is formed by the tangent BD and the secant BG (since BC passes through G). The intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to G that's not containing the angle. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this systematically.

Given that angle CBD is formed at point B, with sides BC and BD. Now, BD is a tangent or a secant? Earlier, we had that points C, D, G are on the circle centered at A. So, BD connects B to D, which is on the circle. So, if BD is a tangent, then it touches the circle only at D. Otherwise, if BD is a secant, it would intersect the circle at two points. But since D is on the circle, and B is outside, BD could be a secant if it passes through another point on the circle. But since we don't have information about another intersection, maybe BD is a tangent. Wait, but the problem statement says "assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent." So, if BD looks like a tangent, then it's a tangent. 

Assuming BD is a tangent, then angle CBD is formed by a tangent (BD) and a secant (BC). The measure of this angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to the other intersection of the secant BC with the circle. Since BC is a secant that passes through C and G (both on the circle), so the intercepted arcs would be arc from D to C and arc from D to G? Wait, no. The formula states that the measure of the angle is half the difference between the intercepted arc that's farthest from the angle and the intercepted arc that's nearest. 

Wait, if BD is tangent at D, then the intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency (D) and the point where the secant intersects the circle. Since the secant BC passes through C and G, the angle at B would intercept arc DC and arc DG? Or arc DG and arc DC? Wait, the angle is formed by BD (tangent at D) and BC (secant through C and G). The intercepted arcs are the arc from D to the point where the secant meets the circle, which is either C or G. But since the secant passes through C and G, which are two points on the circle, the angle intercepts the arc that's opposite to the angle. 

I think the correct formula is that the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, if the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, the measure is half the difference between the intercepted arc (opposite the angle) and the arc that's between the points where the secant meets the circle. Wait, no. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have a tangent at D and a secant that intersects the circle at C and G. The angle at B would be half the difference between the arc DG and the arc DC. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the angle is half the difference between the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the secant (the arc between C and G) and the arc that's intercepted by the tangent (which is zero? No). This isn't making sense. Maybe I should use the general formula for angles formed outside the circle.

The general formula for an angle formed outside the circle by two secants, two tangents, or a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, in this case, angle CBD is formed by a secant (BC) and a tangent (BD). So, applying the formula:

Measure of angle CBD = ½ (measure of arc DG - measure of arc DC)

Wait, why DG and DC? Let me think. The angle is formed by a secant that goes from B through C and G (intercepting arc CG) and a tangent at D. The intercepted arcs would be the arc between the points where the secant meets the circle (arc CG) and the arc between the tangent's point of contact (D) and the other intersection. Wait, but the tangent only touches at D. So maybe the formula is ½ (measure of arc CG - measure of arc DC)?

No, that might not be right. Another approach: The angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc that's between the tangent's point of contact and the secant's second intersection. Wait, in this case, the tangent is at D, and the secant intersects the circle at C and G. So, the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant passing through C and G. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to C and the arc from D to G. But which one is subtracted?

Wait, according to the formula, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two lines forming the angle. In this case, the two lines are the tangent at D and the secant from B through C and G. The intercepted arcs are the arc between D and C (not containing G) and the arc between D and G (not containing C)? Or maybe the major arc and minor arc?

Alternatively, since the angle is formed outside the circle, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, the angle is outside, and the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two lines. For the tangent at D, the intercepted arc is the arc from D to the point where the secant meets the circle (either C or G). Wait, but the secant meets the circle at C and G. So, the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant passing through C and G. Therefore, the intercepted arcs are arc DC and arc DG? Or arc DG and arc DC?

Actually, the formula says that the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then the intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency (D) and the point where the secant meets the circle (say, C), and the arc that is opposite. Wait, no. The angle is formed by two lines: the tangent and the secant. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut by the two lines. Since the tangent is at D and the secant is at C and G, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to C and the arc from D to G. But which one is used?

Alternatively, the intercepted arcs are the arc between the two points where the secant meets the circle (arc CG) and the arc between the point of tangency and the other intersection. Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should assign variables based on known arcs.

We know that arc GD is 50 degrees. Arc CD is 4x + 5 degrees. Let me denote arc GD as 50°, and arc CD as 4x + 5°. Also, since points C, D, G are on the circle, the total circumference is 360°, but we might not need that directly.

If angle CBD is formed by tangent BD and secant BC, then using the formula:

angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc DG)

Wait, assuming that the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant passing through C and G. Then, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be arc CD (between C and D) and arc DG (between D and G). But which one is subtracted?

Wait, the formula is angle = ½ (larger arc - smaller arc). But in this case, since the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, maybe it's ½ (arc CD - arc DG). Or vice versa.

Wait, if I assume that angle CBD is formed by the tangent BD and the secant BG (which passes through C and G), then the measure of angle CBD is ½ (arc CG - arc CD). Wait, arc CG is the arc between C and G, and arc CD is the arc between C and D. But I need to figure out which arc is which.

Alternatively, since arc GD is 50°, and arc CD is 4x + 5°, and points C, D, G are on the circle. So, if I can express arc CG in terms of these, then maybe I can find relations.

Arc CD + arc DG = arc CG? Assuming that points C, D, G are in order around the circle. Wait, but we don't know the order. Depending on their arrangement, arc CG could be arc CD + arc DG or arc CD - arc DG, depending on the position. So, without knowing the order, this is tricky. Maybe we can find relationships based on the given arcs.

Wait, we have arc GD = 50°, and arc CD = 4x + 5°. Let's assume that points C, D, G are placed in the circle such that moving from C to D to G along the circumference. So, arc CD is 4x + 5°, arc DG is 50°, making arc CG = arc CD + arc DG = 4x + 5 + 50 = 4x + 55°. But this assumes that points C, D, G are in sequence around the circle. However, without knowing the exact arrangement, this assumption might be incorrect. Alternatively, if arc CG is the other way, but that would depend on the circle's configuration.

Alternatively, since angle CBD is formed by tangent BD and secant BC, which passes through C and G. If arc CG is the arc that's intercepted by the secant, then the angle CBD is ½(arc CG - arc CD). Wait, but I need to confirm.

Let me search for an alternative approach. Since points C, D, G are on the circle, and arc GD is 50°, arc CD is 4x + 5°. Let me consider the central angles corresponding to these arcs. Since the circle is centered at A, the central angles would be equal to the arc measures. So, angle CAD is equal to arc CD, which is 4x + 5°, and angle GAD is equal to arc GD, which is 50°. Therefore, angle CAD = 4x + 5°, angle GAD = 50°, so angle CAG = angle CAD - angle GAD = (4x + 5) - 50 = 4x - 45°, assuming that points C, D, G are arranged such that D is between C and G along the arc from C to G.

But I don't know the exact positions yet. Alternatively, if points C, D, G are arranged in such a way that arc CD and arc DG are adjacent, then arc CG = arc CD + arc DG. But again, without knowing the order, it's hard to tell. However, since angle CBD is formed by tangent BD and secant BC, maybe we can relate the angle to arc CD and arc DG.

Let me go back to the formula for the angle formed by a tangent and a secant. If the angle is formed by a tangent at D and a secant that passes through C and G, then the measure of the angle is ½ (arc DG - arc DC). Wait, no. Wait, if the tangent is at D, and the secant passes through C and G, then the angle is formed by the tangent and the secant. The intercepted arcs are the arc between D and C (not containing G) and the arc between D and G (not containing C). But since the secant passes through C and G, the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant BG. So, the measure of angle CBD would be ½ (arc DG - arc DC). Wait, but I need to verify this.

Another resource: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency and the secant's second intersection, and the arc that is opposite. Wait, no. The angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency and the secant's second intersection (the arc that's "cut" by the tangent and the secant), and the rest of the circle? No. Let me think of it as follows: imagine the tangent at D and the secant that goes through C and G. The angle at B is formed by the tangent BD and the secant BC. The intercepted arcs are the arc from D to C (which is arc DC) and the arc from D to G (arc DG). But which arc is subtracted?

According to the formula, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the angle is outside the circle, it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The larger arc minus the smaller arc. But which ones are intercepted?

Wait, the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant through C and G. The intercepted arcs are the arc between D and C (which is arc DC) and the arc between D and G (arc DG). But since the secant passes through C and G, the angle is formed by BD (tangent) and BC (secant). The intercepted arcs would be arc DC and arc DG. But which one is the larger arc?

Alternatively, the angle is formed by the tangent and the secant, so the measure is half the difference between the arc intercepted by the secant (arc CG) and the arc intercepted by the tangent (which is zero, since the tangent only touches at one point). But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the formula might be that the measure of the angle is half the difference between the arc that's "facing" the angle and the arc that's "opposite". In this case, the angle is at B, so the arc facing it would be arc CG, and the arc opposite would be arc... I'm stuck.

Maybe I need to take a different route. Let's consider that angle CBD is formed by BC and BD. We know the measure of angle CBD is x + 2.5. Let's assume that angle CBD is formed by two secants, so applying the external angle formula. If BD is a secant instead of a tangent, then the formula applies as follows: angle = ½ (arc CD - arc CG). But we need to know which arcs are being referred to.

Alternatively, since points C, D, G are on the circle, and arc GD is 50°, arc CD is 4x + 5°, maybe we can find other arcs. Let me think about the entire circle. If I can express arc CG in terms of x, then maybe I can set up an equation.

Assume that points C, D, G are in order on the circle, so arc CD + arc DG = arc CG. So, arc CG = (4x + 5) + 50 = 4x + 55 degrees. If angle CBD is formed by secants BC and BD, then the measure of angle CBD is ½ (arc CG - arc CD). Wait, that would be ½ ((4x + 55) - (4x + 5)) = ½(50) = 25°. But the measure of angle CBD is given as x + 2.5. So setting x + 2.5 = 25 => x = 22.5. But this isn't one of the answer choices. So maybe my assumption about the arcs is wrong.

Alternatively, if angle CBD is formed by a tangent and a secant, and the measure is ½ (arc CG - arc CD). Wait, if arc CG is 4x + 55°, then angle CBD = ½ (arc CG - arc CD) = ½((4x + 55) - (4x + 5)) = ½(50) = 25°, leading to x + 2.5 = 25 → x = 22.5. Still not matching the choices.

Hmm. Maybe my assumption about the arcs is wrong. Let me think again. What if arc DG is 50°, and arc CD is 4x + 5°, but angle CBD is formed by tangent BD and secant BC, so angle CBD = ½ (arc DG - arc CD). So, x + 2.5 = ½ (50 - (4x + 5)). Solving:

Multiply both sides by 2: 2x + 5 = 50 - 4x - 5 → 2x + 5 = 45 - 4x → 6x = 40 → x = 40/6 ≈ 6.666..., which is not among the choices either. Not helpful.

Alternatively, angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc DG). So x + 2.5 = ½ (4x + 5 - 50) → x + 2.5 = ½(4x - 45) → Multiply by 2: 2x + 5 = 4x - 45 → -2x = -50 → x = 25. Ah! That gives x = 25, which is option A. But let's check if this is valid.

If x = 25, then arc CD is 4*25 + 5 = 105°, and arc DG is 50°. So, angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc DG) = ½(105 - 50) = ½(55) = 27.5°. But the measure of angle CBD is given as x + 2.5 = 25 + 2.5 = 27.5°. Perfect! This matches. So x = 25, which is option A. But wait, the answer choices include A as 25, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, in this scenario, angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc DG). Why is that the case? Because if the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the angle is formed by a tangent at D and a secant that passes through C and G, then the intercepted arcs would be arc CD and arc DG. But which one is subtracted?

If the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant BC (which passes through C and G), then the intercepted arcs are the arc from D to C and the arc from D to G. But since the secant passes through C and G, the angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant passing through C and G. The formula would be angle = ½ (arc DG - arc DC) if DG > DC. Or angle = ½ (arc DC - arc DG) if DC > DG.

In this case, arc CD is 105°, arc DG is 50°, so angle would be ½(105 - 50) = 27.5°, which matches x + 2.5 = 27.5 ⇒ x = 25. So x = 25, which is option A. But wait, the answer choices include option A as 25, but let me check if this is correct.

However, the question says "any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent", so we assumed BD is a tangent. Is there any reason to believe that BD is a tangent? Since D is on the circle, and B is outside the circle, if BD is tangent, then BD is perpendicular to the radius at D, i.e., AD. But we don't know if that's the case. However, the problem says to assume any segment appearing to be tangent is tangent, so if BD appears to be tangent, then it is. Given that, we proceed.

Thus, solving x + 2.5 = ½ (arc CD - arc DG), with arc CD = 4x + 5 and arc DG = 50, leads us to x = 25. So the answer is A. But let me cross-check.

Wait, but what if the angle is formed by two secants, not a tangent and a secant? Let's reconsider that possibility. If BD is a secant, then angle CBD is formed by two secants, BC and BD. Then, the measure of angle CBD would be ½ (arc CD - arc CG), where arc CG is the arc between C and G. If arc CG = arc CD + arc DG = (4x + 5) + 50 = 4x + 55, then angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc CG) = ½[(4x + 5) - (4x + 55)] = ½(-50) = -25°, which doesn't make sense. So this can't be. Alternatively, if it's ½ (arc CG - arc CD), then angle CBD = ½ (4x + 55 - (4x + 5)) = ½(50) = 25°, which would give x + 2.5 = 25 ⇒ x = 22.5, which is not an option. So this contradicts.

But earlier, assuming that BD is a tangent and using the formula with arc CD - arc DG gave x = 25, which matches the answer choice A. So that must be the correct path.

But why is BD a tangent? How do we know that? Well, the problem says to assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent. So, if BD appears to be tangent, then it is. Given the configuration, since D is on the circle and B is outside, and there's no indication of another intersection, BD might be a tangent. Thus, proceeding with that assumption leads to x = 25, which is option A.

But let me check the answer choices again. Option A is 25, option B is 27.5, option C is 50, option D is 105. Our calculation gives x = 25, which is option A. However, sometimes problems have nuances. Let me recheck the equations.

We assumed that angle CBD = ½ (arc CD - arc DG). Let me verify this formula. If BD is a tangent at D, and BC is a secant intersecting the circle at C and G, then the measure of angle CBD is indeed ½ (arc CD - arc DG). Wait, but usually, the formula is ½ (difference of intercepted arcs). If the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then the measure is ½ (measure of the intercepted arc that's farther from the angle minus the measure of the intercepted arc that's closer). In this case, the intercepted arcs would be arc CD (closer) and arc DG (farther)? Or vice versa?

Actually, the formula is angle = ½ (larger arc - smaller arc). If the angle is formed by a tangent and a secant, then the intercepted arcs are the arc between the point of tangency and the secant's other intersection, and the arc that's opposite. Wait, I think I need to reference the standard formula.

Standard formula: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, it is ½ (measure of the intercepted arc that is farther from the vertex - measure of the intercepted arc that is closer to the vertex).

In this case, the angle at B is formed by tangent BD (at D) and secant BC (intersecting the circle at C and G). The intercepted arcs are arc DC and arc DG. Wait, but which one is farther?

If we imagine the circle with points C, D, G on it, and B outside. The angle at B is formed by BD (tangent) and BC (secant). The intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to C (which is arc DC) and the arc from D to G (arc DG). The angle is formed by the tangent at D and the secant passing through C and G. The arc that is farther from the angle would be the arc that's not containing the angle's vertex. Since the angle is at B, which is outside the circle, the farther arc would be the arc that doesn't contain B. If the secant passes through C and G, then depending on where B is located, but generally, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "cut" by the tangent and the secant.

Alternatively, the formula is angle = ½ (arc DG - arc DC). If arc DG is larger than arc DC, then this would give a positive measure. Let's test with our previous numbers: arc DG = 50°, arc DC = 4x + 5. If x = 25, then arc DC = 105°, so arc DG (50°) is smaller than arc DC (105°). Then angle would be ½ (arc DC - arc DG) = ½(105 - 50) = 27.5°, which matches x + 2.5 = 25 + 2.5 = 27.5. So that works. Therefore, the correct formula is angle = ½ (arc DC - arc DG), which gives us x + 2.5 = ½ (arc DC - arc DG). Substituting arc DC = 4x + 5 and arc DG = 50, we get:

x + 2.5 = ½ (4x + 5 - 50)

Simplify RHS:

4x + 5 - 50 = 4x - 45

So:

x + 2.5 = (4x - 45)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2x + 5 = 4x - 45

Subtract 2x:

5 = 2x - 45

Add 45:

50 = 2x

Divide by 2:

x = 25

Which is option A. So this seems correct. Therefore, the answer is A.

But wait, the answer choices include B as 27.5, which would be the value of the angle, but the question asks for x. So x is 25, which is option A. Hence, Final Answer: A.

To solve the given geometric problem, we begin by analyzing the key elements and applying the appropriate geometric theorems.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are given the following important facts:

- **Angle**: $ \text{m}\angle CBD = x + 2.5^\circ $
- **Arc Measures**:
  - $ \text{m}(\widehat{GD}) = 50^\circ $
  - $ \text{m}(\widehat{CD}) = 4x + 5^\circ $
- Several points lie on specific lines and circles:
  - Points $ C, D, G $ lie on a common circle centered at $ A $.
  - $ G $ lies on line $ BC $, implying that $ BC $ is a secant that intersects the circle at $ C $ and $ G $.
  - $ BD $ is interpreted as a **tangent**, due to the instruction that “any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent”.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem**

The angle formed by a **tangent** and a **secant** intersecting outside the circle is given by:

$$
\text{m}\angle CBD = \frac{1}{2} (\text{arc } CD - \text{arc } DG)
$$

This is derived from the fact that the angle formed outside the circle by a tangent and a secant is half the **difference** of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

---

### **Step 3: Plug in Known Values**

From the above, we substitute:

- $ \text{m}(\widehat{CD}) = 4x + 5 $
- $ \text{m}(\widehat{DG}) = 50 $

So,

$$
x + 2.5 = \frac{1}{2} [(4x + 5) - 50]
$$

---

### **Step 4: Solve the Equation**

Start by simplifying the right-hand side:

$$
x + 2.5 = \frac{1}{2}(4x - 45)
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
2x + 5 = 4x - 45
$$

Subtract $ 2x $ from both sides:

$$
5 = 2x - 45
$$

Add 45 to both sides:

$$
50 = 2x
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
x = 25
$$

---

### **Step 5: Verify Against the Answer Choices**

Answer choices:

- A. 25  
- B. 27.5  
- C. 50  
- D. 105  

Our solution yields $ x = 25 $, which corresponds to **Option A**.
