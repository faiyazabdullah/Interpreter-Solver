MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle centered at point X, right? All these points A, B, C, D, Y, Z lie on this circle because they're mentioned in the PointLiesOnCircle statements. Also, there are some lines and perpendicularity conditions. The question is asking for the measure of arc CD, given that AB is 30 units, CD is also 30 units, and the measure of arc CZ is 40 degrees. Let me break it down step by step.

First, since all points A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the same circle centered at X, that means they're all points on the circumference. The circle has center X, so any line from X to another point would be a radius. Wait, but the problem mentions AB and CD as lengths. Are those chords? Because AB and CD are segments between two points on the circle, so yes, they should be chords. And their lengths are both 30. But how does that relate to the arcs?

Also, given that arc CZ measures 40 degrees. We need to find arc CD. Hmm. Let me recall that the length of a chord is related to the central angle subtended by the chord. The formula for the length of a chord is 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle and R is the radius. Since both AB and CD have the same length (30), their corresponding central angles should be equal. Therefore, if AB corresponds to some central angle, say α, then CD would correspond to the same angle α. But wait, the problem says CD's length is 30, which matches AB's length, so maybe their arcs are congruent?

But the problem gives us arc CZ is 40 degrees. How does that fit into this? Let me think about the positions of the points. 

Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle. Let me note the lines mentioned:

- Line(X,Z) and Line(X,Y): So points Z and Y are connected to X. Also, since they are on the circle, lines XZ and XY are radii. Similarly, lines like Line(X,A) etc., but maybe not necessary here.

Wait, the Perpendicular conditions:

- Perpendicular(Line(Y,M), Line(M,A)): So line YM is perpendicular to line MA.

- Perpendicular(Line(N,D), Line(Z,N)): Line ND is perpendicular to line ZN.

Hmm, but I'm not sure yet how these perpendicularly conditions affect the arcs. Maybe they help determine certain angles or relationships between the points?

Alternatively, perhaps focusing first on the arcs. Let's consider arc CZ is 40°, and need to find arc CD. If I can relate arc CZ to arc CD somehow.

But how do these points relate? Let me check the given constraints again:

PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(X,Z)) → So N lies on line XZ. Similarly, M lies on line XY. Then, N lies on line CD (from the constraint PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(C,D))). And M lies on line AB (PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(A,B))).

So, points N is the intersection of line XZ and line CD. Similarly, M is the intersection of line XY and line AB.

Additionally, there's the perpendicularity:

- Line YM ⊥ Line MA. Since M is on AB, and line MA is part of AB. Wait, line MA connects M to A. But since M is on line AB, then line MA is just a segment of AB. Wait, but line YM is perpendicular to line MA. So line YM is perpendicular to AB. Since M is on AB, and YM is perpendicular to AB. That suggests that YM is the altitude from Y to AB? Or something similar?

Similarly, line ND is perpendicular to line ZN. Since N is on line CD and line XZ. So line ND is perpendicular to line ZN. So line ND is perpendicular to line ZN. Which might imply that triangle ZND is right-angled at N?

But maybe I need to focus more on the arcs. Let me go back to the main question: Given AB = CD = 30, and arc CZ = 40°, find arc CD.

Since AB and CD are chords of the circle with the same length, their subtended arcs must be equal. Therefore, arc AB equals arc CD. Wait, but the problem states that arc CZ is 40°, which may not directly relate to arc CD unless there's some relationship between points C, Z, and D.

Wait, perhaps points C, Z, and D are arranged such that arc CZ is part of the larger arc CD? For example, if moving from C to Z to D along the circumference, then arc CZ + arc ZD = arc CD. However, without knowing where Z is located relative to C and D, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express arc CD using arc CZ and some other known arcs.

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle centered at X, and considering the lines connecting them. Let me think about the positions of points C and D. Since N lies on CD and on XZ. So line XZ intersects CD at N. Also, line ND is perpendicular to line ZN. So triangle ZND is right-angled at N. Therefore, triangle ZND has a right angle at N. Therefore, angle ZND is 90 degrees. Since ZN is part of line XZ, and ND is part of line CD. Therefore, this implies that CD is tangent to the circle with diameter ZN? Wait, no. Wait, triangle ZND being right-angled at N implies that CD is perpendicular to ZN. Since ZN is part of line XZ, so CD is perpendicular to XZ. Therefore, line CD is perpendicular to line XZ. Therefore, line CD is perpendicular to the radius XZ. Therefore, CD is tangent to the circle at point Z? Wait, no. Wait, if a line is perpendicular to a radius at its endpoint, then it's tangent. But here, CD passes through N, which is on XZ. But CD is not necessarily passing through Z. Wait, unless N is Z? No, because N lies on line CD and on line XZ, but unless N coincides with Z, which isn't stated. So line CD is intersecting line XZ at point N, and CD is perpendicular to XZ at N. Therefore, that would mean that CD is perpendicular to XZ at N, so that implies that CD is tangent to the circle only if N were Z. Otherwise, CD is a secant line intersecting XZ at N, and being perpendicular to XZ.

But since CD is a chord of the circle (since C and D are on the circle), and it's perpendicular to XZ at N. Therefore, XZ is the line from center X to point Z, and CD is a chord perpendicular to XZ at N. Therefore, this tells us that N is the midpoint of CD? Wait, no. Wait, when a line through the center is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. But here, XZ is not necessarily passing through the center unless Z is diametrically opposite to something. Wait, X is the center. So line XZ is a radius, going from center X to point Z. So if CD is perpendicular to XZ at N, then XZ is a radius, and CD is a chord perpendicular to XZ. Therefore, the line XZ is perpendicular to CD and passes through N. In that case, N would be the midpoint of CD, since the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, N is the midpoint of CD. Hence, CN = DN. Therefore, the length of CD is twice the length from C to N, or D to N.

But since CD is a chord of length 30, then each half is 15. But how does that help us with the arc measure?

Now, since CD is perpendicular to XZ, which is a radius. Let me recall that the length of a chord is related to the central angle. The formula is chord length = 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. So for chord CD, length CD = 2R sin(theta_CD / 2). Similarly, for chord AB, same length, so same central angle theta_AB = theta_CD. So theta_AB = theta_CD. But we don't know the radius yet. However, the problem gives us arc CZ is 40 degrees. So arc CZ is 40°, which is the arc from C to Z. Need to relate that to arc CD.

Let me visualize the circle with center X. Points C and D are endpoints of a chord CD, with N being the midpoint of CD, lying on XZ. So line XZ passes through N and is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, point Z lies somewhere along the line XZ. Since N is the midpoint of CD, and XZ is a radius. So, position of Z depends on where N is along XZ. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help.

Let me assume coordinate system with X at origin (0,0). Let me suppose that line XZ is along the x-axis. So point Z is at some coordinate (a, 0). Since XZ is a radius, so length XZ is R, the radius. Therefore, point Z is at (R, 0). Then, line XZ is the x-axis. Since CD is perpendicular to XZ at N, which is the midpoint of CD. Therefore, CD is vertical (perpendicular to x-axis). So point N lies on x-axis, and CD is vertical line through N. Since N is midpoint of CD, coordinates of C and D are symmetric around N. Suppose N has coordinates (h, 0). Then, since CD is vertical, points C and D are (h, k) and (h, -k) for some k. The distance between C and D is 2k = 30, so k=15. Therefore, coordinates of C and D are (h, 15) and (h, -15). Now, since C and D are on the circle centered at X(0,0) with radius R. Therefore, plugging in coordinates of C: h² + 15² = R². Same for D: same equation. So R² = h² + 225.

Now, arc CZ is 40 degrees. Let me find the measure of arc from C to Z. To compute that, we need to find the central angle ∠CXZ. Because arc CZ corresponds to the central angle between points C and Z.

Point Z is at (R, 0). Point C is at (h, 15). The vector from X to C is (h, 15), and from X to Z is (R, 0). The angle between these vectors is the central angle for arc CZ, which is 40 degrees.

Therefore, the cosine of angle CXZ is equal to the dot product of XC and XZ divided by the product of their magnitudes. Since XC and XZ are both radii, magnitude is R. The dot product is (h)(R) + (15)(0) = hR. Therefore,

cos(theta_CZ) = (hR)/(R * R) ) = h/R.

But theta_CZ is 40 degrees. Therefore:

h/R = cos(40°)

But earlier, from the coordinates of point C, we had R² = h² + 225. Therefore:

R² = h² + 225 => h² = R² - 225.

Substituting h = R cos(40°):

h = R cos(40°)
=> h² = R² cos²(40°)
Thus,
R² cos²(40°) = R² - 225
Divide both sides by R²:
cos²(40°) = 1 - 225/R²
Therefore,
225/R² = 1 - cos²(40°)
Which is:
225/R² = sin²(40°)
Therefore,
R² = 225 / sin²(40°)
Take square root:
R = 15 / sin(40°)

So, R = 15 / sin(40°). Let me compute sin(40°). Well, exact value isn't needed right now, but this relates R to the given information.

Now, our goal is to find the measure of arc CD. Arc CD corresponds to the central angle between points C and D. From coordinates, points C(h,15) and D(h,-15). So the central angle between C and D is the angle between vectors XC and XD.

Vector XC is (h, 15), vector XD is (h, -15). The angle between them can be found via dot product:

cos(theta_CD) = (XC • XD) / (|XC||XD|) )

XC • XD = h*h + 15*(-15) = h² - 225

|XC| = |XD| = R

Thus,

cos(theta_CD) = (h² - 225)/R²

From before, we had h² = R² - 225. Substitute:

h² - 225 = (R² - 225) - 225 = R² - 450

Thus,

cos(theta_CD) = (R² - 450)/R² = 1 - 450/R²

But earlier, we had R² = 225 / sin²(40°). Therefore:

450/R² = 450 * sin²(40°)/225 = 2 sin²(40°)

Hence,

cos(theta_CD) = 1 - 2 sin²(40°)

Recall the double-angle identity: cos(2α) = 1 - 2 sin²α. So here, alpha is 40°, so:

cos(theta_CD) = cos(80°)

Therefore, theta_CD = 80° or -80°, but since angles in circles are positive and less than 360°, theta_CD is 80°.

Wait, that seems promising! So arc CD measures 80 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 80. So the answer should be D.

But let me verify once again. Let me recap:

We found that the central angle for arc CD is 80 degrees, hence the measure is 80°, which is option D. 

But let me check if there's another way to see this. Since arc CZ is 40°, and point Z is on the circle. If we can find the relation between arc CZ and arc CD. 

But in our coordinate setup, point Z was at (R, 0), and point C was at (h,15). The central angle between C and Z was 40°, and then the central angle between C and D was 80°, which is double. Is there a reason why?

Well, since CD is perpendicular to XZ, and N is the midpoint of CD. So the line XZ passes through the midpoint of CD and is perpendicular to CD. This setup makes the triangle XCD an isoceles triangle with base CD and height XN. Wait, but XN is along XZ. Wait, since N is the midpoint of CD, and XN is part of XZ. So the length XN is the distance from center X to the chord CD. The formula for the distance from the center to the chord is d = R cos(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is that the distance from the center to the chord is d = R cos(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance from the center to the chord is d = R cos(theta/2)? Let me recall. 

Actually, the distance from the center to the chord is d = R cos(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Wait, no. Let me think. If you have a chord of central angle theta, then splitting the chord into two equal parts, forming a right triangle with hypotenuse R, adjacent side d, and opposite side (chord length)/2. So:

sin(theta/2) = (chord length / 2)/R => chord length = 2R sin(theta/2)

And the distance from center to chord is d = R cos(theta/2)

In our case, for chord CD, the distance from center X to CD is d = XN. Earlier, in coordinates, XN is the horizontal distance from X(0,0) to N(h,0), which is |h|. So d = |h|. And according to formula, d = R cos(theta_CD / 2). So:

|h| = R cos(theta_CD / 2)

Earlier, we had h = R cos(40°). Wait, but how did that come? Because the central angle between C and Z was 40°, leading to h = R cos(40°). But in reality, theta_CZ is 40°, so that's different from theta_CD. 

But regardless, through the calculation above, we arrived at theta_CD = 80°, which would make sense if the arc CZ is half of arc CD. But why?

Looking back, in our coordinate system, point Z was at (R,0), and point C was at (h,15). The central angle between C and Z is 40°, and the central angle between C and D is 80°, so the arc from C to D is double that of arc from C to Z. Why? Because in the coordinate system, point D is the reflection of point C over the x-axis (since CD is vertical, N is on x-axis). Therefore, the central angle from C to D would be twice the angle from C to Z if Z is positioned such that... Wait, maybe not. It depends on the specific location. But in our case, since the central angle between C and Z is 40°, and the central angle between C and D is 80°, which is double. So that suggests that arc CD is twice arc CZ, hence 80°. Therefore, answer D.

Another way to think: If you imagine the circle, with point Z at (R,0), point C somewhere in upper half, point D mirrored below. The arc from C to Z is 40°, and from C to D would pass through Z? Not necessarily. Unless the arc is the minor arc. Depending on the direction. But given that the chord CD is perpendicular to XZ, and given that the central angle came out to be 80°, which is double of 40°, that seems plausible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property here. If a chord is perpendicular to a radius, then the arc it subtends relates to the angle between the radius and the chord. But I think the previous calculation shows that theta_CD is 80°, so the answer is D.

Thus, the correct answer should be D. 80 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described by the given constraints. All points $ A, B, C, D, Y, Z $ lie on the circle centered at $ X $. Additionally, several perpendicularity and collinearity conditions define specific relationships among these points.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

We are told:

- Chords $ AB $ and $ CD $ have the **same length**, i.e., both equal to 30 units.
- The arc $ \overset{\frown}{CZ} $ measures $ 40^\circ $.
- We are asked to find the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{CD} $.

Because both $ AB $ and $ CD $ are chords of the same circle and have equal lengths, their **central angles** must be equal. Thus, the arcs $ \overset{\frown}{AB} $ and $ \overset{\frown}{CD} $ are congruent.

However, we are given the arc $ \overset{\frown}{CZ} $ instead of $ \overset{\frown}{CD} $, so we need to find a way to relate these arcs.

---

### Step 2: Coordinate Setup and Trigonometric Insight

Assume a coordinate system with center $ X $ at the origin. Place:

- Point $ Z $ at $ (R, 0) $, where $ R $ is the radius of the circle.
- The line $ XZ $ lies along the x-axis.
- Since line $ CD $ is **perpendicular to** $ XZ $ at point $ N $, and $ N $ lies on both line $ CD $ and line $ XZ $, the perpendicularity condition implies that $ CD $ is a **vertical** chord passing through the midpoint $ N $ of the chord $ CD $, and thus, the line $ XZ $ bisects the chord $ CD $.

This setup confirms that the central angle for arc $ \overset{\frown}{CD} $ is determined by the angular displacement between points $ C $ and $ D $, which are symmetric with respect to the x-axis due to the perpendicularity condition.

---

### Step 3: Using Known Arc Measure to Determine Central Angle

We are given that the arc $ \overset{\frown}{CZ} = 40^\circ $. Let’s denote:

- $ \theta_{CZ} = 40^\circ $
- $ \theta_{CD} $ is the desired arc measure.

By symmetry and the fact that point $ Z $ lies on the x-axis while point $ C $ is above it (and point $ D $ is its mirror image across the x-axis), the angle $ \angle CXZ $ is $ 40^\circ $, and the total angle swept from $ C $ to $ D $ through the center is:

$$
\theta_{CD} = 2 \cdot \angle CXZ = 2 \cdot 40^\circ = 80^\circ
$$

This follows from the fact that the central angle between points $ C $ and $ D $ spans the full angle formed by reflecting across the x-axis.

---

### Final Conclusion

The measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{CD} $ is therefore $ 80^\circ $.

---

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{D}
