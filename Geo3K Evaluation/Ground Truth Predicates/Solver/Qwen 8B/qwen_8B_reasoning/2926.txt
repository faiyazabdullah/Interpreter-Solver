Find the area of the trapezoid.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of the trapezoid based on the given information. First, I need to visualize the problem. The problem mentions points A, D, B, and C, with certain lengths and perpendicular lines. Let me note down the given data:

- Length of AD is 15 units.
- Length of DB is 10 units.
- Length of AC is 14 units.
- Line AC is perpendicular to line AD.
- Line DB is perpendicular to line DA.

Wait, so line AC is perpendicular to AD. That means angle at A between AC and AD is 90 degrees. Similarly, line DB is perpendicular to DA, which would mean that at point D, line DB is perpendicular to DA. So maybe we can sketch this?

Let me try to imagine or draw coordinates for these points. Coordinates might help here since there are perpendicular lines involved. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.

Let’s place point A at the origin (0,0) because dealing with coordinates might simplify things. Since AD is a line, and AC is perpendicular to AD, let me assume AD is along the x-axis. Then AC would be along the y-axis because they're perpendicular.

So, point A is (0,0). If AD is along the x-axis, then point D will be at (15, 0) because length AD is 15. Now, AC is perpendicular to AD, so AC is vertical. The length of AC is 14, so point C would be at (0,14) since starting from A (0,0) moving up 14 units along y-axis. Wait, but wait—AC could also be in the negative direction, but probably positive as per standard position unless specified otherwise.

But hold on, there's another line DB which is perpendicular to DA. DA is the same as AD, right? From D to A. So DA is from D(15,0) to A(0,0), which is along the x-axis. Therefore, DB is perpendicular to DA. Since DA is horizontal, DB must be vertical. But where is point B located?

Point D is at (15,0). The line DB is perpendicular to DA, meaning it's vertical. So from D(15,0), moving vertically upwards or downwards. The length of DB is 10 units. So point B could be either (15, 10) or (15, -10). Hmm. But since we are talking about a trapezoid, perhaps the positions should be such that AB and CD are the two bases? Or maybe AD and BC? Wait, need to figure out how the points connect.

Wait, the question says it's a trapezoid. A trapezoid has one pair of sides parallel. Given that AC and DB are both perpendicular to AD, which is horizontal. So AC is vertical, and DB is vertical. Therefore, AC and DB are both vertical lines. So if AC is vertical (from A(0,0) to C(0,14)) and DB is vertical (from D(15,0) to B(15,10) or (15,-10)). 

Now, connecting these points. Let me think: trapezoid usually requires four sides. So points A, D, B, and C. Wait, but how are they connected? Let me see. If we have points A, D, B, and C, then maybe the trapezoid is ADBC? Or ABCD? Need to check which sides are parallel.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is formed by AB, BC, CD, DA? Wait, but without knowing the order, it's hard. However, since there are two vertical lines AC and DB, which are both perpendicular to AD. Maybe the trapezoid has two vertical sides AC and DB, making them the legs? Wait, but in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel. Wait, no—if two sides are parallel, then they can be the bases. Alternatively, if AC and DB are both perpendicular to AD, then AC and DB are both perpendicular to AD, hence they are parallel to each other. Because they are both vertical. So if AC and DB are both vertical, then they are parallel. Thus, the trapezoid would have AC and DB as the two parallel sides. Then the other sides would be AD and BC. Wait, but AD is horizontal. So if AC and DB are vertical, then AD is horizontal, and BC connects points B and C. Let me try to figure out coordinates of all points.

Assuming point A is (0,0), D is (15,0). Point C is (0,14) since AC is vertical with length 14. For point B, since DB is vertical, from D(15,0) upwards or downwards. Let's say upwards for simplicity. So B is (15, 10). So coordinates:

A = (0,0)

D = (15,0)

C = (0,14)

B = (15,10)

Now, connecting these points. Let's check the shape. If we consider quadrilateral ADBC. Let's list the sides:

AD: from A(0,0) to D(15,0)

DB: from D(15,0) to B(15,10)

BC: from B(15,10) to C(0,14)

CA: from C(0,14) back to A(0,0)

Wait, but then the trapezoid would be ADBC. Is this a trapezoid? Let's check which sides are parallel. AD is horizontal, DB is vertical, BC is some line, CA is vertical. Wait, AC is vertical (from A to C) and DB is vertical (from D to B). So AC and DB are both vertical, hence parallel. Therefore, the trapezoid has two parallel sides: AC and DB. Therefore, it's a trapezoid with bases AC and DB, and legs AD and BC. Wait, but AD is horizontal, and BC is slanting. Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is ABDC? Or another configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is AB CD? Let me confirm. The key is that the two parallel sides are AC and DB. So the trapezoid would have those two sides as its bases. To find the area of a trapezoid, the formula is (base1 + base2)/2 * height. But here, the bases are AC and DB, which are vertical. Wait, but in trapezoid area, the height is the distance between the two bases. Since AC and DB are both vertical, their distance apart is the horizontal distance between them. Since AC is at x=0 (from A(0,0) to C(0,14)), and DB is at x=15 (from D(15,0) to B(15,10)). So the horizontal distance between them is 15 units. Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is 15 units. Wait, but the formula for trapezoid area is average of the two bases multiplied by the height between them. So bases are AC and DB. Their lengths are 14 and 10 respectively. So area would be (14 + 10)/2 * 15 = (24/2)*15 = 12*15 = 180. Which is option C. But wait, let me verify again.

Wait, but I assumed that AC and DB are the two bases. However, in a trapezoid, the height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. In this case, since the bases are vertical, the horizontal distance between them is indeed 15 units, which is the height. So yes, using the formula (base1 + base2)/2 * height gives 180. But let me check if this is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I got the bases wrong. Another possibility: maybe the trapezoid has AD and BC as the two bases? But AD is horizontal, and BC would be from B(15,10) to C(0,14). Let me compute the slope of BC. The change in y is 14 - 10 = 4, change in x is 0 - 15 = -15. So slope is 4/-15. Not sure if that's parallel to anything else. So if AD is horizontal, and BC is not horizontal, so only AC and DB are vertical. Hence, they are the two bases. Therefore, the previous calculation applies.

But let me check if the trapezoid is actually defined correctly. Are the sides AD and BC the non-parallel sides? Yes, because AD is horizontal and BC is slanting. So the trapezoid is between the two vertical lines AC and DB, with AD and BC being the legs. So the area would be (length of AC + length of DB)/2 multiplied by the horizontal distance between them (which is AD's length, 15). So that gives (14+10)/2 *15 = 24/2 *15= 12*15=180. Which is option C.

But let me cross-validate this with another approach. Maybe calculating coordinates and using coordinate geometry.

Coordinates:

A(0,0), D(15,0), B(15,10), C(0,14).

The trapezoid is ADBC. Let me calculate the area via coordinates. Using the shoelace formula.

List the coordinates in order. Let's take A(0,0), D(15,0), B(15,10), C(0,14), back to A(0,0).

Shoelace formula:

Area = ½ |sum(x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Calculating terms:

First, multiply x_i * y_{i+1}:

A to D: x=0, y=0; next point D(15,0): term is 0*0 = 0

D to B: x=15, y=0; next point B(15,10): term is 15*10 = 150

B to C: x=15, y=10; next point C(0,14): term is 15*14 = 210

C to A: x=0, y=14; next point A(0,0): term is 0*0 = 0

Sum of these terms: 0 + 150 + 210 + 0 = 360

Then sum of y_i * x_{i+1}:

A to D: y=0 * x_next=15 → 0*15=0

D to B: y=0 * x_next=15 → 0*15=0

B to C: y=10 * x_next=0 → 10*0=0

C to A: y=14 * x_next=0 → 14*0=0

Sum of these terms: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Thus, area is ½ |360 - 0| = 180. So that confirms the area is 180, which is option C.

But let me check if the coordinates were correct. What if point B was below D? Suppose instead of (15,10), it's (15,-10). Then the trapezoid would be different. Let me test that scenario.

If B is (15,-10), then coordinates are A(0,0), D(15,0), B(15,-10), C(0,14). Applying shoelace formula:

Order A(0,0), D(15,0), B(15,-10), C(0,14), back to A.

Compute x_i y_{i+1}:

A-D: 0*0=0

D-B: 15*(-10)= -150

B-C: 15*14=210

C-A: 0*0=0

Total sum: 0 -150 +210 +0 = 60

y_i x_{i+1}:

A-D: 0*15=0

D-B: 0*15=0

B-C: (-10)*0=0

C-A: 14*0=0

Total sum: 0

Area: ½ |60 - 0| = 30. Which is way smaller. But that contradicts our earlier conclusion. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Because depending on the position of B, the trapezoid may be oriented differently. However, the problem didn't specify whether B is above or below D. But since the lengths are given as positive numbers, and assuming the trapezoid is convex and the usual orientation, perhaps B is above D. Also, when we considered B above D, we got area 180, which matches option C. But if B is below, the area is 30, which isn't among the choices except if there's a mistake. However, given that the answer options include 180 as option C, and that the first calculation gives 180, which is plausible.

Another thing to check: when we took B as (15,10), the shoelace gave 180. But maybe the actual trapezoid is different. Let me check if the sides are connected properly. For example, if the trapezoid is A, B, C, D? Or another order?

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is A, B, D, C? Let me try that order.

Points A(0,0), B(15,10), D(15,0), C(0,14). Shoelace formula:

x_i y_{i+1}:

A-B: 0*10 = 0

B-D: 15*0 = 0

D-C: 15*14 = 210

C-A: 0*0 = 0

Sum: 0 + 0 + 210 + 0 = 210

y_i x_{i+1}:

A-B: 0*15 = 0

B-D: 10*15 = 150

D-C: 0*0 = 0

C-A: 14*0 = 0

Sum: 0 + 150 + 0 + 0 = 150

Area: ½ |210 - 150| = 30. Again, different result. So the order of the points matters. So perhaps I need to ensure that the correct order is used.

Wait, but the problem states it's a trapezoid. So the correct order must form a trapezoid. Earlier, when taking the order A, D, B, C, the area came out as 180. But how do we know that's the correct order?

Perhaps the trapezoid is ADBC, meaning sides AD, DB, BC, and CA. Let me check if that makes sense. AD is from A to D, then DB from D to B, then BC from B to C, then CA from C back to A. This forms a quadrilateral. Let me check if this is a trapezoid. As before, AC and DB are both vertical, hence parallel. So that's a valid trapezoid.

Therefore, with that order, shoelace gives 180. So the correct answer is C. 180. However, looking at the answer choices, option C is 180. So that seems to fit.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to get the area. Since AC and DB are the two parallel sides (bases), with lengths 14 and 10, and the distance between them is the horizontal distance between the lines AC and DB, which is 15 units (since AC is at x=0 and DB is at x=15). Therefore, area is ((14 + 10)/2) * 15 = 12 * 15 = 180. Yep, same result.

Hence, the correct answer is C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area of the trapezoid defined by the given constraints, we begin by assigning coordinates to the points to facilitate geometric analysis. Here is the logical breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Coordinates Based on Constraints**

We are given:

- $ \text{Length}(AD) = 15 $
- $ \text{Length}(DB) = 10 $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 14 $
- $ \overline{AC} \perp \overline{AD} $
- $ \overline{DB} \perp \overline{DA} $

Let us place point $ A $ at the origin:  
$$
A = (0, 0)
$$

Since $ \overline{AD} $ lies horizontally and $ \overline{AC} \perp \overline{AD} $, we place point $ D $ along the x-axis at:  
$$
D = (15, 0)
$$

From point $ A $, since $ \overline{AC} $ is vertical and has length 14, point $ C $ is:  
$$
C = (0, 14)
$$

Next, $ \overline{DB} \perp \overline{DA} $, meaning $ \overline{DB} $ is vertical (as $ \overline{DA} $ is horizontal). With length 10, point $ B $ lies directly above or below point $ D $. We choose the upward direction (standard convention) to maintain consistency:  
$$
B = (15, 10)
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine Shape and Identify Bases & Height**

With the points assigned as follows:

- $ A = (0, 0) $
- $ D = (15, 0) $
- $ C = (0, 14) $
- $ B = (15, 10) $

We observe:

- $ \overline{AC} $ and $ \overline{DB} $ are both vertical, thus **parallel**.
- These are the **two bases** of the trapezoid.
- The **distance between these bases**, i.e., the **height**, is the horizontal distance between the vertical lines $ x = 0 $ (for $ \overline{AC} $) and $ x = 15 $ (for $ \overline{DB} $), which equals 15 units.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Area of Trapezoid**

Using the trapezoid area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2}{2} \times \text{Height}
$$

Substitute values:

- $ \text{Base}_1 = \text{Length}(AC) = 14 $
- $ \text{Base}_2 = \text{Length}(DB) = 10 $
- $ \text{Height} = 15 $

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{14 + 10}{2} \times 15 = \frac{24}{2} \times 15 = 12 \times 15 = 180
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verification via Shoelace Formula**

To validate, use the shoelace formula for the polygon defined by the vertices in order: $ A(0, 0) \to D(15, 0) \to B(15, 10) \to C(0, 14) \to A(0, 0) $

Apply the shoelace formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 
0\cdot0 + 15\cdot10 + 15\cdot14 + 0\cdot0 - (0\cdot15 + 0\cdot15 + 10\cdot0 + 14\cdot0) 
\right|
= \frac{1}{2} |0 + 150 + 210 + 0 - 0| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 360 = 180
$$

This confirms the area is **180**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{C}
$$
