MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives us some constraints. Let me list them out again:

First, the length of line BC is equal to x. Then, the length of AB is 5 units. Also, the length of AC is 3√2. Additionally, there's a perpendicularity condition: line CA is perpendicular to line CB. Wait, so lines CA and CB are perpendicular? That means that at point C, the two lines CA and CB form a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at point C?

Wait, hold on. If lines CA and CB are perpendicular, then yes, the angle at point C between CA and CB is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. So, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse? Wait, but AB is given as 5, and AC is given as 3√2. Wait, but if it's a right triangle at C, then AB should be the hypotenuse. But according to Pythagoras theorem, AB² = AC² + BC². Let me check that.

So, AB² equals (AC)² plus (BC)². Given that AB is 5, so 5 squared is 25. AC is 3√2, so (3√2)^2 is 9 * 2 = 18. Then BC squared would be x squared. Therefore, 25 = 18 + x². Solving for x², that would be 25 - 18 = 7. Therefore, x is √7. So that would make x equal to sqrt(7). Looking at the answer choices, option A is sqrt(7). So maybe the answer is A?

But wait, let me double-check. Is the right angle at C? Because the problem says Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B)). So line CA and line CB are perpendicular. That means that the angle between CA and CB is 90 degrees, which is indeed the angle at point C. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Hence, AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, using Pythagoras, AB² = AC² + BC². Plugging numbers, 5² = (3√2)² + x² → 25 = 18 + x² → x² = 7 → x = √7. So that seems straightforward. 

But let me check if I misread anything. For example, could there be another interpretation of the perpendicular lines? Like, maybe not the angle at C? Wait, Line(C,A) and Line(C,B) are perpendicular. So those two lines meet at point C, hence forming the right angle there. So yeah, the right angle is at C. So the triangle is right-angled at C. Therefore, my calculation holds. 

Looking at the answer choices, A is sqrt(7), which matches our result. So the answer should be A. Let me just confirm once more. Suppose AC is 3√2, BC is sqrt(7), then AB should be sqrt( (3√2)^2 + (√7)^2 ) = sqrt(18 + 7) = sqrt(25) = 5. Which matches the given AB length. Perfect. So that checks out. Therefore, x is sqrt(7), so answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 5 $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 3\sqrt{2} $
- $ \angle C $ is a right angle because $ \text{Line}(CA) \perp \text{Line}(CB) $

This tells us that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ C $. Thus, side $ AB $ serves as the **hypotenuse**, while sides $ AC $ and $ BC $ are the **legs** of the triangle.

### Step 1: Use the Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem states:
$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$
We know:
- $ AB = 5 $
- $ AC = 3\sqrt{2} $
- $ BC = x $ (what we're solving for)

Substitute known values into the equation:
$$
5^2 = (3\sqrt{2})^2 + x^2
$$
$$
25 = 9 \cdot 2 + x^2
$$
$$
25 = 18 + x^2
$$
$$
x^2 = 25 - 18 = 7
$$
$$
x = \sqrt{7}
$$

### Step 2: Match with Answer Choices

From the provided answer choices:
- A. $ \sqrt{7} $
- B. $ 3\sqrt{2} $
- C. $ 3\sqrt{3} $
- D. $ 3\sqrt{6} $

Only option **A** matches the computed value of $ x = \sqrt{7} $.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
