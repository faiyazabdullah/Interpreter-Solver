Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the measure of angle ABC here. So first, I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the constraints provided.

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D, and some angles. The key given information includes:

1. Measure of angle ACD is 148 degrees. Wait, angle at point C between points A, C, D? So that would be ∠ACD, which is formed by points A-C-D. So vertex at C, with sides going to A and D.

Then, it says Measure of angle CAB is 2x - 15. Wait, angle CAB is at point A, so that's ∠CAB, meaning vertex at A, with sides going to C and B. Wait, but the notation Angle(C, A, B) usually means the angle at point A between points C, A, B. So yes, that's ∠CAB. So that angle is equal to 2x - 15 degrees.

Next, Measure of angle ABD is x - 5. So angle at point B between points A, B, D. That would be ∠ABD. So that angle is x - 5 degrees.

Also, there's a condition that point C lies on line BD. So point C is somewhere along the line connecting B and D. So BD is a straight line, and point C is on it. Therefore, points B, C, D are colinear in that order? Or maybe C could be between B and D, depending on the configuration.

Wait, since angle ACD is mentioned, which involves points A, C, D. If C is on BD, then lines AC and CD form angle at C. Also, angle CAB is part of triangle ABC?

Hmm, perhaps I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me think:

Points B and D are connected by a line, with point C lying somewhere on BD. Then, point A is connected to both B and C (since we have angles involving A, C, B). Maybe triangle ABC, with point C on BD?

So, considering that, let me try to imagine triangle ABC, with point C on BD. But then, point D is another point on the same line as BC. So, for example, if we have line BD with point C in between B and D, then D is beyond C from B.

But then angle ACD is given as 148 degrees. So angle at C between A and D. Since C is on BD, that would mean that line CD is part of BD. Therefore, angle ACD is formed by line CA and line CD (which is part of BD). So, if I consider triangle ACD, but maybe not. Alternatively, since C is on BD, then angle ACD is adjacent to angle ACB?

Wait, if C is on BD, then angles at C related to lines AC and CB. Hmm. Let me think again.

Let me try to note down all the angles given:

- ∠ACD = 148°
- ∠CAB = 2x - 15°
- ∠ABD = x - 5°
- Point C is on line BD.

We need to find m∠ABC, which is the angle at point B between points A, B, C. So ∠ABC.

So, let's think about possible relationships. Since C is on BD, BD is a straight line, so angles around point C might add up to 180°, but not sure yet.

First, let's consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we know ∠CAB is 2x - 15°, and we need to find ∠ABC. However, without knowing other angles or sides, maybe we need to relate it through other angles given.

Alternatively, looking at point C on BD. Since C is on BD, then line BD passes through C. So, maybe considering angles at point C.

At point C, there's ∠ACD = 148°, which is part of the straight line BD. Since BD is a straight line, the sum of angles on a straight line is 180°, so if we can find the other angle at point C related to BD.

Since point C is on BD, then line CD is a segment of BD. Therefore, the angle between AC and CD is 148°, which is ∠ACD. But since CD is part of BD, then the other angle at point C would be ∠BCA (if we consider line BC and CD). Wait, because BD is a straight line passing through C, so angles on either side of line BD at point C would add up to 180°.

Therefore, ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, because they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair along BD. Wait, no. Wait, ∠ACD is between AC and CD. But CD is part of BD. So, if you look at point C, with line BD passing through it, then line CD is extending from C towards D. So, line BC goes from C to B, and line CD goes from C to D. Therefore, the angle between BC and CD is a straight line, so ∠BCD is 180°, but ∠ACD is given as 148°, which is the angle between AC and CD. Therefore, the remaining angle between AC and BC would be ∠ACB, which is supplementary to ∠ACD?

Wait, no. Because if you have two lines intersecting at point C: line AC and line BD. Since BD is a straight line, and C is on BD, then line BD splits into segments BC and CD. Therefore, the angle between AC and BD at point C is split into two parts: one is ∠ACD (between AC and CD), and the other is ∠ACB (between AC and BC). Wait, but those two angles (∠ACB and ∠ACD) are adjacent and together make up the angle between AC and BD. However, since BD is a straight line, the total angle between AC and BD would be 180°, right? Wait, no. The angle between AC and BD depends on the direction of AC relative to BD.

Wait, actually, when you have a straight line BD, and a line AC meeting it at point C, then the angles formed on either side of AC would be vertical angles or supplementary. For instance, if you have line BD passing through C, and line AC forming an angle with BD. Then, the angle between AC and BC (which is part of BD) plus the angle between AC and CD (the other part of BD) equals 180°, because they are adjacent angles on a straight line.

So, ∠ACB (the angle between AC and BC) and ∠ACD (the angle between AC and CD) are supplementary. Hence:

∠ACB + ∠ACD = 180°

Given that ∠ACD = 148°, so:

∠ACB = 180° - 148° = 32°

So, ∠ACB is 32 degrees.

Now, in triangle ABC, we have ∠CAB = 2x - 15°, ∠ACB = 32°, and we need to find ∠ABC.

In any triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°

Substituting known values:

(2x - 15) + ∠ABC + 32 = 180

Combine constants:

(2x - 15 + 32) + ∠ABC = 180

Which simplifies to:

2x + 17 + ∠ABC = 180

So,

∠ABC = 180 - 2x -17 = 163 - 2x

Wait, but we also have another piece of information: Measure of angle ABD is x - 5°. Let's see what ∠ABD refers to.

Angle ABD is at point B, between points A, B, D. Since point D is on line BD, which passes through C. So, point D is on the extension of BC beyond C. Therefore, angle ABD is formed by BA and BD. Since BD is a straight line, and point C is on BD, then BD is a straight line starting at B, going through C, then to D.

So, ∠ABD is the angle at B between BA and BD. Which would include the angle between BA and BC, and then from BC to BD. But since point C is on BD, then BD is just an extension of BC beyond C. Therefore, ∠ABD is composed of ∠ABC and ∠CBD?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. At point B, we have two lines: BA and BD. Since BD is a straight line passing through C, so from B, going through C to D. Therefore, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. Which is the same as the angle between BA and BC, since BD extends beyond C. Wait, but BD is a straight line, so ∠ABD is the same as ∠ABC if D is in the same direction as BC. Wait, no. Wait, if D is on line BD, which starts at B and goes through C. So, if we imagine point C between B and D, then BD is from B through C to D. So, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. So, if we consider BA and BD, then angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD, which would be ∠ABC plus ∠CBD? No, because BD is continuing past C. Wait, if point C is between B and D, then BD is longer than BC. So, from point B, line BD goes through C to D. Therefore, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD, which would consist of angle between BA and BC (which is ∠ABC) and angle between BC and BD (which is zero because BD continues from BC)? Wait, no. Wait, angle ABD is at point B, between BA and BD. Since BD is a straight line through C, then the direction from B to D is the same as from B to C extended. Therefore, ∠ABD is the same as ∠ABC only if D is in the opposite direction of C from B. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Imagine point B, with line BD going through C. So, if we're at point B, and we have line BD going through C to D. So, the direction from B to D is through C. Therefore, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. So, if we consider BA and BD, then ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD. Now, since point C is on BD, then BD can be thought of as BC extended beyond C to D. Therefore, the angle between BA and BD is the same as the angle between BA and BC, unless D is in a different direction. Wait, but if D is on the line BD, then depending on whether C is between B and D or not, but the problem states that point C lies on line BD, so it's possible that C is between B and D, or D is between B and C. But since angle ACD is given, which involves point D, likely C is between B and D. Otherwise, if D were between B and C, then angle ACD would involve points A, C, D where D is between B and C, making angle ACD possibly different.

Assuming that C is between B and D, then BD is from B to C to D. Therefore, from point B, line BD goes through C to D. Therefore, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD, which is the same as the angle between BA and BC, because BD is an extension of BC. Wait, but angle between BA and BD would be larger than angle between BA and BC. Wait, no. Wait, if you have BA and BD, with BD being a continuation of BC, then ∠ABD would be equal to ∠ABC plus ∠CBD? But since D is further away from B than C is, then ∠CBD is zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider coordinates. Suppose I assign coordinates to simplify. Let me place point B at origin (0,0), point C at (c,0), and point D at (d,0) where d > c, so that BD is a horizontal line from B(0,0) to C(c,0) to D(d,0). Then, point A is somewhere else. Then, angle ABD is the angle at B between BA and BD. Since BD is along the positive x-axis from B(0,0) to D(d,0), and BA is some line from B(0,0) to A(x,y). The measure of angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD (positive x-axis). 

But how does this help? Well, if we can relate this angle to other angles.

But maybe instead of coordinates, think in terms of angles. Since point C is on BD, then BD is a straight line. So, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. But BD passes through C, so if we consider triangle ABC, then angle ABC is part of angle ABD. Wait, because if you extend BC beyond C to D, then angle ABD would be angle ABC plus angle CBD. But since D is on line BD, and C is between B and D, then angle CBD is zero? No, because CBD is the angle at point C between points B, C, D. Wait, no, angle CBD is at point B? No, angle CBD is at point C between points B, C, D. Wait, confusion arises.

Alternatively, since angle ABD is at point B between points A, B, D. Since BD is a straight line, and C is on BD, then BD is a straight line. So, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. But angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Therefore, since BD is a straight line passing through C, then angle ABD is equal to angle ABC plus angle CBD. But angle CBD is the angle at point B between points C, B, D. Wait, no, that's not. Wait, angle CBD would be at point C. Wait, I think I need to get back.

Let me try again. At point B, we have two rays: one going to A (BA), and another going to D (BD). Since point C is on BD, BD is a straight line, so the ray BD is just the same as BC extended beyond C. Therefore, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. This angle can be broken down into angle ABC (between BA and BC) and angle CBD (but CBD is at point C, not at point B). Wait, no. Wait, if you have BA and BD, with D lying on the line BC extended beyond C, then angle ABD is the same as angle ABC, because BD is just extending BC. Wait, no. Wait, if you have BA and BD, with BD being a straight line that goes through C, then angle between BA and BD is the same as angle between BA and BC, because BD is just an extension of BC. So, angle ABD equals angle ABC?

Wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier statement that angle ABD is x - 5, and we need to find angle ABC. If angle ABD equals angle ABC, then x - 5 would equal angle ABC. But earlier, we had ∠ABC = 163 - 2x. So setting them equal:

x - 5 = 163 - 2x → 3x = 168 → x=56. Then angle ABC would be 56 -5 = 51? Wait, but that may not be correct. Wait, why do I think angle ABD equals angle ABC? Because if BD is an extension of BC, then angle between BA and BD is the same as angle between BA and BC. But that would imply that angle ABD equals angle ABC. Is that accurate?

Wait, suppose I have point B, with BA going off in some direction, and BD going through C and D. So, if I'm standing at point B, looking along BD towards D, then angle between BA and BD is the same as angle between BA and BC, since BD is a straight line through C. Therefore, angle ABD is equal to angle ABC. Therefore, ∠ABD = ∠ABC. Therefore, according to the problem, ∠ABD = x - 5°, so ∠ABC = x - 5°. But earlier, using triangle ABC, we had ∠ABC = 163 - 2x. So combining these equations:

x - 5 = 163 - 2x → 3x = 168 → x = 56.

Thus, substituting back, ∠ABC = x - 5 = 56 -5 = 51°, which would be option B.

But wait, let me verify if my assumption that ∠ABD equals ∠ABC is correct. Because if BD is a straight line through C, then ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD, which is indeed the same as the angle between BA and BC, since BD is just an extension of BC. So yes, ∠ABD = ∠ABC. Therefore, that relationship holds.

But let me check again with another approach. Suppose we use the fact that in triangle ABC, we have ∠CAB = 2x - 15, ∠ACB = 32°, and ∠ABC = ?

From before, we had:

∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180 → (2x -15) + ∠ABC + 32 = 180 → ∠ABC = 180 - 2x -17 = 163 - 2x.

And since ∠ABD = x -5, and we concluded ∠ABD = ∠ABC, so:

x -5 = 163 - 2x → 3x = 168 → x = 56. Thus, ∠ABC = 56 -5 = 51°, which is option B.

But let me double-check if there's another way this could be approached, in case my assumption was wrong.

Alternative approach: Consider that ∠ABD is an external angle to triangle ABC. Wait, if D is on line BC extended, then ∠ABD is an external angle. Wait, but in our case, D is on line BD, which contains point C. So if C is between B and D, then BD is BC extended beyond C to D. Therefore, angle ABD is an external angle to triangle ABC at point B. Wait, but the external angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. However, in this case, ∠ABD would be an external angle to triangle ABC. The remote interior angles would be ∠BAC and ∠BCA. Wait, let's recall the exterior angle theorem: the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

If ∠ABD is an exterior angle at B for triangle ABC, then it should equal ∠BAC + ∠BCA.

Wait, but ∠ABD is the angle outside the triangle, so if we consider triangle ABC, then extending BC to D, making ∠ABD an exterior angle. Therefore:

∠ABD = ∠BAC + ∠BCA.

Yes! So, ∠ABD = ∠BAC + ∠BCA.

Given that ∠ABD = x -5, ∠BAC = 2x -15, and ∠BCA = 32°, as previously determined.

Therefore:

x -5 = (2x -15) + 32

Simplify:

x -5 = 2x + 17

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

x -2x = 17 +5 → -x = 22 → x = -22

Wait, that gives x negative, which is impossible for angle measures. So something is wrong here.

This contradicts our previous conclusion. So, there must be a mistake in assuming that ∠ABD is an exterior angle. Why did I think that?

Because if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then ∠ABD is an external angle. However, in that case, the exterior angle would be ∠ABD, and the remote interior angles are ∠BAC and ∠BCA. But according to this calculation, solving gives x=-22, which is invalid. So where is the error?

Possibly in the identification of which angle is the exterior angle. Let me re-examine.

If we have triangle ABC, and we extend BC to a point D such that D is not between B and C but rather beyond C, then the exterior angle at B would be ∠ABD. Wait, no. When you extend BC beyond C to D, the exterior angle at B is still ∠ABD? Wait, no. Wait, the exterior angle is formed by one side and the extension of another. So if you extend BC beyond C to D, then the exterior angle at B would be... Wait, no. The exterior angle at B would be formed by extending AB or BC. Wait, if you extend BC beyond C to D, then the exterior angle at B would be formed by extending AB or BC. Wait, maybe I confused the vertices.

Actually, when you extend BC beyond C to D, then the exterior angle at B would be formed by the side AB and the extension of BC. Wait, but the extension of BC is BD. So, the exterior angle at B would be ∠ABD. Yes. So, the exterior angle ∠ABD equals the sum of the remote interior angles ∠BAC and ∠BCA. So according to the exterior angle theorem:

∠ABD = ∠BAC + ∠BCA

But in this case, plugging in:

x -5 = (2x -15) + 32 → x -5 = 2x + 17 → -x = 22 → x = -22. Which is impossible, as angle measures can't be negative. Therefore, contradiction.

This suggests that there's a flaw in my reasoning. Where is the mistake?

Possibly in the assumption that ∠ABD is an exterior angle. Maybe because the extension isn't in the right direction. Or perhaps the location of point D affects this.

Wait, if point C is on BD, but D could be on the other side. For example, if D is between B and C, then extending BD would go in the opposite direction. Let me consider that possibility.

Suppose that point D is between B and C, so that line BD has point D between B and C. Then, extending BD beyond D would go in the opposite direction. However, the given angle ACD is 148°, which would require that point D is such that when you connect A to C and D to C, the angle at C is 148°. If D is between B and C, then line CD would be from C to D (towards B), making angle ACD between AC and CD (which is towards B). In that case, the angle between AC and CD (towards B) would be 148°, and then the angle between AC and CB (which is the other side) would be 180° - 148° = 32°, which is ∠ACB. So regardless of whether D is on one side or the other, the calculation for ∠ACB remains the same. However, the position of D affects whether ∠ABD is an exterior angle or not.

If D is between B and C, then BD is from B to D to C. So, the line BD is from B through D to C. Then, angle ABD is the angle at B between BA and BD. If D is between B and C, then BD is shorter than BC. So, in this scenario, ∠ABD would be smaller than ∠ABC, since BD is closer to B than BC is. Therefore, in this case, ∠ABD is not an exterior angle, but an internal angle. Therefore, my earlier application of the exterior angle theorem was incorrect, leading to inconsistency.

So, this suggests that my initial assumption about the position of D is critical. How do I determine where D is located?

The problem states that point C lies on line BD. It doesn't specify whether D is on one side or the other. However, the existence of angle ACD implies that D is positioned such that line CD forms an angle with AC. If D were between B and C, then CD would be from C to D, which is towards B, and angle ACD would be between AC and CD (towards B). However, if D is on the other side, then CD is extending from C away from B.

But since angle ACD is given as 148°, which is quite large (>90°), suggesting that AC is forming a wide angle with CD. Depending on where D is, this could affect the rest.

Let me try to resolve this ambiguity. Perhaps I need to consider both possibilities.

Case 1: D is on the extension of BC beyond C (i.e., C is between B and D).

Case 2: D is on the extension of BC beyond B (i.e., B is between C and D).

Let me explore both cases.

Case 1: D is beyond C from B. As before, ∠ACD = 148°, so ∠ACB = 32°, as before. Then, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD, which would be an exterior angle, giving us the equation x -5 = 2x -15 + 32, leading to x = -22, which is invalid. So this case is impossible.

Case 2: D is on the other side, such that B is between C and D. So, the line BD passes through C, with D on the opposite side of B from C. So, imagine points arranged as D---B---C. Wait, no: if B is between C and D, then the order is C---B---D. So line BD goes from B through C to D. Wait, no: if B is between C and D, then the line BD passes through C and D, with B in the middle. So, the order would be C---B---D. Wait, but then point C is between B and D? No, if B is between C and D, then the order is C---B---D. So, point C is on the line BD, with B between C and D. Wait, but the original problem states that point C lies on line BD. So, this is possible. In this case, line BD has points in the order C---B---D. So, from point C, going through B to D.

In this case, angle ACD is the angle at C between points A, C, D. So, since D is on the line extending from B through C, then CD is the line from C to D, which is in the direction opposite to B. So, angle ACD is formed between AC and CD. Now, since B is between C and D, then line CB is from C to B, and line CD is from C to D. Therefore, angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD = 148°, and angle between AC and CB would be ∠ACB, which would be supplementary to ∠ACD if they are adjacent. Wait, but since B is between C and D, then line CB is part of CD. Wait, no. If D is on the line BD, with B between C and D, then line CD is from C to D, which goes through B. So, line CD passes through B, so the angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD = 14 between AC and CD. But since line CB is part of CD (from C to B to D), then ∠ACB is part of ∠ACD?

Wait, if we have angle ACD at point C between AC and CD. Since CD is from C through B to D, then ∠ACD is made up of ∠ACB and ∠BCD. Wait, no. From point C, the line CD goes through B to D. So, the angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD, which includes the angle between AC and CB (which is ∠ACB) and the angle between CB and CD. But since CB is part of CD, then ∠ACD is just ∠ACB plus ∠BCD? No, because CB is a segment of CD. Wait, if you have a straight line CD passing through B, then the angle between AC and CD is the same as the angle between AC and CB. Wait, no. Because if you have a straight line CD, and you're measuring the angle between AC and CD at point C, then it's the angle between AC and CD, which is the same as the angle between AC and CB, since CB is a part of CD. Wait, no. Because if CD is a straight line, and CB is part of it, then the angle between AC and CD is the same as the angle between AC and CB. Unless AC is on the other side. Wait, this is very confusing without a diagram.

Let me try to think differently. Since in Case 2, where D is on the line BD with B between C and D, then line CD passes through B. Therefore, ∠ACD is the angle between AC and CD. Since CD passes through B, then ∠ACD is equal to ∠ACB + ∠CBD? No, because CBD is at point B. Wait, no. At point C, the angle between AC and CD is ∠ACD. Since CD passes through B, then line CB is part of CD. Therefore, ∠ACD is the angle between AC and CB, which is ∠ACB. Wait, that would mean ∠ACD = ∠ACB. But the given value is ∠ACD = 148°, so ∠ACB = 148°, which would make ∠ACB = 148°, which seems too large for a triangle. Let me check.

In triangle ABC, if ∠ACB = 148°, and ∠CAB = 2x -15°, then the third angle ∠ABC = 180 - (2x-15) -148 = 180 -2x +15 -148 = 47 -2x. Also, ∠ABD is given as x -5°. What is ∠ABD in this scenario?

Since D is on line BD with B between C and D, then BD is from B to D, passing through C. So, at point B, angle ABD is the angle between BA and BD. Since BD passes through C, which is on the line, and D is on the other side of B from C. So, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD. But since D is on the line BD, which extends from B through C to D, then ∠ABD would be the same as ∠ABC, because BD is just extending from B through C. Wait, no. If D is on the other side of B from C, then BD is a straight line from B through D, but C is on the opposite side. Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Maybe I need to reconsider the entire approach. Let's try to write down all equations without assuming the position of D.

We know that ∠ACD = 148°. Since C is on BD, then the angle between AC and BD at point C is 148°, which is ∠ACD. Since BD is a straight line, the angle between AC and BD is 148°, which means that the other angle at point C, which would be ∠ACB, is supplementary to ∠ACD if they are on a straight line. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a straight line BD, and a line AC intersecting it at C, then the angle between AC and BD is ∠ACD (on one side) and the other side would be the supplement. So, if ∠ACD = 148°, then the other angle (which would be ∠ACB) is 180° - 148° = 32°, as before. Therefore, ∠ACB = 32°, regardless of the position of D.

So, ∠ACB = 32°, which is fixed.

Then, in triangle ABC, we have:

∠CAB = 2x - 15°, ∠ACB = 32°, and ∠ABC = ?.

Sum of angles is 180°, so:

(2x -15) + ∠ABC + 32 = 180 → ∠ABC = 180 - 2x -17 = 163 - 2x.

Now, we need to relate ∠ABC to the given ∠ABD = x -5°.

To do this, we need to express ∠ABD in terms of other angles.

Since point C is on BD, and ∠ABD is at point B, between A and D. Let's consider the straight line BD, with point C on it. So, BD is a straight line, and C is somewhere on it.

If we consider triangle ABD, but we don't know much about it. Alternatively, consider the line BD, with points B, C, D in some order. Let's assume that C is between B and D. Then, BD is from B to C to D. Then, ∠ABD is the angle at B between BA and BD. This angle can be broken down into ∠ABC and ∠CBD. Wait, but ∠CBD is at point C, not at point B. So, no. Wait, at point B, the angle between BA and BD is ∠ABD. Since BD passes through C, then BD is a straight line, so ∠ABD is the same as ∠ABC if D is in the same direction as C. But if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then ∠ABD is the same as ∠ABC. But earlier, applying the exterior angle gave a contradiction. However, if we instead consider that ∠ABD = ∠ABC + something?

Wait, if D is beyond C from B, then BD is extending from B through C to D. So, from point B, the angle between BA and BD is ∠ABD, which includes the angle between BA and BC (which is ∠ABC), and then from BC to BD, which is zero because BD continues from BC. Wait, no, because if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then BD is just BC extended, so ∠ABD is the same as ∠ABC. Hence, ∠ABD = ∠ABC. So, x -5 = ∠ABC = 163 - 2x. Solving:

x -5 = 163 - 2x → 3x = 168 → x = 56.

Then ∠ABC = x -5 = 56 -5 = 51°, which is option B.

However, earlier, when trying to apply the exterior angle theorem, it led to a contradiction. Why?

Because if ∠ABD = ∠ABC, then the exterior angle theorem wasn't applied correctly. The exterior angle theorem applies when you extend a side of the triangle, creating an exterior angle. In this case, if we extend BC to D, then ∠ABD is not an exterior angle of triangle ABC, but rather, it's the same as ∠ABC. Hence, the earlier application of the exterior angle theorem was incorrect, leading to the contradiction. So, the correct approach is to recognize that ∠ABD = ∠ABC, leading to x = 56 and ∠ABC = 51°, which is option B.

But let's confirm this with another method. Let's substitute x = 56 into the angles.

If x = 56, then:

∠CAB = 2*56 -15 = 112 -15 = 97°

∠ACB = 32°

∠ABC = 51°

Sum: 97 + 51 + 32 = 180°, which checks out.

Also, ∠ABD = x -5 = 56 -5 = 51°, which equals ∠ABC = 51°, confirming that ∠ABD = ∠ABC. Hence, this makes sense.

So, the correct answer is B. 51 degrees.

But wait, earlier when I tried applying the exterior angle theorem, I got x = -22, which was invalid. But that was due to incorrectly identifying the exterior angle. Hence, the correct approach is to recognize that ∠ABD = ∠ABC, leading to the solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and the given angle measures:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \angle ACD = 148^\circ $
- $ \angle CAB = 2x - 15^\circ $
- $ \angle ABD = x - 5^\circ $
- Point $ C $ lies on line $ BD $

This tells us that $ C $ is collinear with $ B $ and $ D $. So, the points $ B $, $ C $, and $ D $ lie on a single straight line in some order. Importantly, this allows us to consider linear pairs and triangle angle sums.

---

### **Step 2: Use Linear Pair to Determine $ \angle ACB $**

Since $ C $ lies on line $ BD $, the straight line $ BD $ passes through $ C $, and thus the angles at point $ C $, specifically $ \angle ACB $ and $ \angle ACD $, are supplementary (they form a linear pair):

$$
\angle ACB + \angle ACD = 180^\circ
$$

Plugging in $ \angle ACD = 148^\circ $:

$$
\angle ACB = 180^\circ - 148^\circ = 32^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Apply Triangle Angle Sum in Triangle $ ABC $**

Now, consider triangle $ ABC $. We know:

- $ \angle CAB = 2x - 15^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = 32^\circ $
- $ \angle ABC = ? $

Using the triangle angle sum property:

$$
\angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
(2x - 15) + \angle ABC + 32 = 180
$$

Simplify:

$$
2x + \angle ABC + 17 = 180
\Rightarrow \angle ABC = 163 - 2x
$$

---

### **Step 4: Relate $ \angle ABD $ to $ \angle ABC $**

Now consider $ \angle ABD $. Since point $ C $ lies on line $ BD $, and $ \angle ABD $ is the angle between $ BA $ and $ BD $, while $ \angle ABC $ is the angle between $ BA $ and $ BC $, we observe:

- Since $ C $ lies on $ BD $, and $ D $ lies on the same line, the direction of $ BD $ is unchanged.
- Therefore, $ \angle ABD = \angle ABC $

This is because $ BD $ is an extension of $ BC $, and the angle between $ BA $ and $ BD $ is the same as the angle between $ BA $ and $ BC $.

So:

$$
\angle ABD = x - 5 = \angle ABC = 163 - 2x
$$

Set the expressions equal:

$$
x - 5 = 163 - 2x
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
3x = 168 \Rightarrow x = 56
$$

---

### **Step 5: Compute Final Value of $ \angle ABC $**

Now plug $ x = 56 $ into $ \angle ABC = x - 5 $:

$$
\angle ABC = 56 - 5 = 51^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All steps lead consistently to the conclusion that the measure of $ \angle ABC $ is $ \boxed{51} $ degrees.
