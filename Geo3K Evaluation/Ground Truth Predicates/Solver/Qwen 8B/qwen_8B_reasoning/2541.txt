====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral ABCD, and some angle measures and perpendicular lines given. The question is asking for the measure of angle A. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the given constraints:

1. Measure of angle BAD (which is angle at point A between points B, A, D) is equal to 3x.
2. Measure of angle ADC (angle at point D between points A, D, C) is equal to x.
3. Line CD is perpendicular to line CB. So that means angle at point C between lines CD and CB is 90 degrees.
4. Line BA is perpendicular to line BC. So angle at point B between lines BA and BC is also 90 degrees.

Wait, so let me visualize this quadrilateral. Let me try to sketch it mentally. Points A, B, C, D forming a quadrilateral. Let's note the perpendiculars first.

Since BA is perpendicular to BC, that suggests that at point B, the lines BA and BC form a right angle. So triangle ABC would be a right-angled triangle at B? Wait, but ABCD is a quadrilateral, not necessarily a triangle. But maybe parts of it.

Also, CD is perpendicular to CB. So at point C, lines CD and CB are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at C between CB and CD is 90 degrees. So that makes sense. So both angles at B and C are right angles?

So quadrilateral ABCD has two right angles at B and C. Hmm. But then, depending on how the sides connect, maybe it's a rectangle or something else, but since there are two right angles, but not necessarily all four.

But let me think about the angles. We need to find angle at A, which is angle BAD = 3x. Also, angle ADC is x. Let me recall that in a quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees. Maybe I can use that.

Let me denote the angles:

Angle at A: BAD = 3x.

Angle at D: ADC = x. Wait, but angle ADC is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, in a quadrilateral, each vertex has one angle. So angle ADC is the angle at D between points A, D, C. So yes, that's angle D.

Then, angles at B and C: since BA is perpendicular to BC, angle at B is 90 degrees. Similarly, CD is perpendicular to CB, so angle at C is 90 degrees as well. Wait, but angle at C is between CB and CD. So yes, angle BCD is 90 degrees. So angles at B and C are both right angles.

Therefore, total sum of angles in quadrilateral is 360 degrees. So:

Sum = angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 4x + 180 = 360.

So solving for x: 4x + 180 = 360 → 4x = 180 → x = 45 degrees.

Therefore, angle A is 3x = 3*45 = 135 degrees. So the measure of angle A is 135 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 135. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything here. Let me check again.

The key assumption was that the angles at B and C are each 90 degrees. Is that accurate?

Given that BA is perpendicular to BC. So BA ⊥ BC implies that the angle between BA and BC is 90 degrees. Since BA and BC meet at point B, that angle is indeed angle ABC, which is 90 degrees. Similarly, CD is perpendicular to CB, meaning that at point C, the lines CD and CB are perpendicular. Therefore, angle BCD is 90 degrees. So angles at B and C are right angles. Hence, their measures are 90° each.

Then, angle at D is given as x. Wait, angle ADC is x. Wait, angle ADC is the angle at D, between A-D-C. So that's angle D. Then angle A is angle BAD = 3x. So adding up all angles:

angle A (BAD) + angle B (ABC) + angle C (BCD) + angle D (ADC) = 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 4x + 180 = 360. Solving gives x=45, hence angle A is 135. That seems correct.

Alternatively, could there be another way to interpret the diagram? For example, maybe the quadrilateral isn't convex? Or perhaps some other configuration?

But given the constraints, the standard approach would assume convexity unless stated otherwise. Also, the perpendiculars suggest that the sides BA and BC are perpendicular, and CB and CD are perpendicular. So that would create a sort of 'corner' at B and C. So the shape might look like a rectangle but with some sides extended. However, even if it's concave, the sum of internal angles still holds. But since angles at B and C are right angles, they are likely convex.

Another thing to check: Are there any other angles or relations that I haven't considered? For instance, maybe triangle relationships?

For example, looking at triangle ABC. If BA is perpendicular to BC, then triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Similarly, triangle BCD is right-angled at C. But how does that relate to the rest of the quadrilateral?

But maybe not necessary for calculating angle A. Since we already used the total sum of angles in quadrilaterals. But just to confirm, maybe there's another method.

Alternatively, suppose we consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to points to model this.

Let me place point B at origin (0,0). Since BA is perpendicular to BC, let me take BA along y-axis and BC along x-axis. Let me say point B is at (0,0).

Let me define:

Point B: (0, 0)

Since BA is vertical (assuming BA is along positive y-axis), then point A would be somewhere along y-axis. Let me say A is at (0, a) for some a > 0.

Similarly, BC is horizontal (along x-axis), so point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0.

Now, CD is perpendicular to CB. CB goes from C to B, which is towards the left along x-axis. So CD must be vertical upwards or downwards. Since CD is perpendicular to CB (which is horizontal), CD must be vertical. So direction from C is vertical. So point D is either straight up or straight down from C.

But since ABCD is a quadrilateral, connecting points A-B-C-D-A.

Assuming the order is A-B-C-D-A. So after point C, we go to D, then back to A.

If CD is vertical upward from C, then point D would be (c, d) where d is some value. Then, from D to A, which is connected back to A(0,a). So need to ensure that the angle at D is x, which is angle ADC.

Wait, angle ADC is the angle at D between points A-D-C. So vectors DA and DC.

But maybe assigning coordinates will complicate things, but let me try.

Let me proceed:

Points:

B: (0, 0)

A: (0, a)

C: (c, 0)

D: ?

CD is perpendicular to CB. Vector CB is from C to B: (-c, 0). So CD must be vertical. Therefore, vector CD is (0, k) for some k. Therefore, point D is C plus (0, k): (c, 0 + k) = (c, k). So D is at (c, k).

So coordinates:

A: (0, a)

B: (0, 0)

C: (c, 0)

D: (c, k)

Now, need to connect D back to A. So side DA connects D(c, k) to A(0, a). Now, angle at D is angle ADC, which is the angle between DC and DA.

Vector DC is from D to C: (c - c, 0 - k) = (0, -k)

Vector DA is from D to A: (0 - c, a - k) = (-c, a - k)

So angle ADC is the angle between DC (vector (0, -k)) and DA (vector (-c, a - k)). The measure of this angle is x.

Additionally, angle BAD is 3x. Angle BAD is the angle at A between points B, A, D. So vectors AB and AD.

Vector AB is from A to B: (0 - 0, 0 - a) = (0, -a)

Vector AD is from A to D: (c - 0, k - a) = (c, k - a)

So angle BAD is the angle between AB (downward y-axis) and AD (from A to D). This angle is 3x.

So maybe using coordinate system, we can compute these angles.

But this might get complex. Alternatively, since we already have the sum of angles giving us x=45, leading to angle A being 135, which is option C. But maybe there's a mistake here?

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that angle at D is x. Because angle ADC is x, but in our coordinate setup, angle at D is between DC and DA. Let me see.

But according to the problem statement, angle ADC is x. Which is the same as angle at D. So in our calculation above, angle D is x. And angle A is 3x. Angles at B and C are 90°, so total angles add up to 4x + 180 = 360 => x=45. So angle A is 135°, which is answer C. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the angles at B and C? Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says:

Perpendicular(Line(C, D), Line(C, B)): So line CD is perpendicular to line CB. So that's angle at C between CB and CD is 90°, which is angle BCD, so that's angle at C. So angle C is 90°.

Perpendicular(Line(B, A), Line(B, C)): Line BA is perpendicular to line BC. So angle at B between BA and BC is 90°, so angle at B is 90°. Thus angles at B and C are right angles. So that's correct.

Thus, the previous reasoning holds. Therefore, angle A is 135°, so answer C.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the quadrilateral is crossed? But generally, unless specified, quadrilaterals are considered simple (non-crossed). So the sum of angles formula applies.

Alternatively, could there be another interpretation of angle ADC? For example, maybe angle ADC refers to a different angle? Like, if the quadrilateral is labeled differently? For example, sometimes quadrilaterals are named in order, so ABCD implies edges AB, BC, CD, DA. So angle ADC is at D, between points A, D, C, so that's the angle at D between sides CD and DA. Yes, which is angle D. So that's correct.

Hence, my conclusion remains. So answer is C, 135 degrees. Therefore, Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle A$ in quadrilateral $ABCD$, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Given Constraints**

We are told:

1. $\angle BAD = 3x$
2. $\angle ADC = x$
3. $CD \perp CB$ ⟹ $\angle BCD = 90^\circ$
4. $BA \perp BC$ ⟹ $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$

This tells us that the angles at vertices $B$ and $C$ are both right angles ($90^\circ$).

---

### **Step 2: Use the Sum of Interior Angles in a Quadrilateral**

In any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is always:

$$
\text{Sum} = 360^\circ
$$

Let’s denote the angles as follows:

- $\angle A = \angle BAD = 3x$
- $\angle B = \angle ABC = 90^\circ$
- $\angle C = \angle BCD = 90^\circ$
- $\angle D = \angle ADC = x$

Adding them together:

$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 3x + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x = 4x + 180^\circ
$$

Set this equal to the total sum of angles in a quadrilateral:

$$
4x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ
$$

Solving for $x$:

$$
4x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x = 45^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find $\angle A$**

Recall that:

$$
\angle A = 3x = 3 \times 45^\circ = 135^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the geometric constraints and the angle sum property of quadrilaterals, we have determined that the measure of $\angle A$ is:

$$
\boxed{135^\circ}
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
$\boxed{\text{C}}$
