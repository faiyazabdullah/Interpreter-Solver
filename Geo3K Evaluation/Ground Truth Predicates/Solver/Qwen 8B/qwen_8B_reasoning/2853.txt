MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle ABC with some specific lengths and a right angle. The question asks for cos A, given that a=14, b=48, and c=50. Wait, hold on—let me make sure I get the notation right here. In triangle problems, usually, uppercase letters denote vertices, and lowercase letters denote the lengths opposite those angles. But sometimes there can be confusion. Let me check the problem again.

The problem says:

- Length of line CB is a
- Length of line AB is c
- Length of line CA is b
- Lines CA and CB are perpendicular.

So, translating that into triangle ABC:

Let me visualize triangle ABC. Points A, B, C. The lines mentioned are CB (so from C to B), which has length a. Then AB (from A to B) has length c. And CA (from C to A) has length b. Also, lines CA and CB are perpendicular. So, at point C, the two sides CA and CB form a right angle. That means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. Wait, because CA and CB are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at C is 90 degrees. 

Wait, but then the sides around the right angle would be CA and CB, so those would be legs, and AB would be the hypotenuse. However, according to the given lengths:

CA is length b (so that's one leg), CB is length a (the other leg), and AB is length c (hypotenuse). But wait, in standard terms, in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at C, then AB is indeed the hypotenuse. Therefore, by Pythagoras, we should have:

a² + b² = c².

But let me check with the given values. Here, a=14, b=48, c=50.

Calculating 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500. And 50² is 2500. Okay, that checks out. So the triangle is a right-angled triangle at C.

Now, the question is asking for cos A. So angle A is at vertex A. Let me recall how to compute cosine of an angle in a triangle. In general, cosine of an angle in a triangle is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. But in this case, since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe we can use the definition based on the sides.

In triangle ABC, angle A is at vertex A. The sides adjacent to angle A are AC and AB? Wait, no. Let me think. For angle A, the sides forming that angle are AB and AC. Wait, no. At vertex A, the two sides connected are AB and AC. Wait, but in the triangle, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but since the triangle is right-angled at C, the sides adjacent to angle A would be AC (which is length b) and AB (the hypotenuse, length c). Wait, but actually, when calculating cosine of angle A, we need to consider the adjacent side and the hypotenuse. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an acute angle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.

But angle A is not the right angle. The right angle is at C. So angle A is one of the acute angles. To find cos A, we can use the adjacent side over hypotenuse. Which sides are adjacent to angle A?

At angle A, the sides are AB (opposite to angle C) and AC (length b). Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me draw the triangle mentally. Right-angled at C. So points C is the right angle, connected to A and B. So, AC is one leg (length b=48), BC is the other leg (length a=14), and AB is the hypotenuse (length c=50).

Angle A is at vertex A. So, in triangle ABC, angle A is formed by sides AB and AC. Wait, but AB is the hypotenuse. Let me recall the definitions. In triangle ABC, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but AB is opposite to angle C, and AC is one of the legs.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines might be helpful here. Wait, but since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe it's simpler. Alternatively, since we know all three sides, we can use trigonometric ratios.

In a right-angled triangle, cos(angle) equals adjacent over hypotenuse. So for angle A, the adjacent side is AC (since angle A is at A, the sides adjacent to angle A are AC and AB? No, wait. Let me clarify.

In triangle ABC, with right angle at C. So, angle A is at vertex A. The sides relative to angle A are:

Opposite side: BC (which is length a=14)

Adjacent side: AC (which is length b=48)

Hypotenuse: AB (length c=50)

Therefore, cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AC / AB = b / c.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So cos A would be AC divided by AB. Because adjacent over hypotenuse. So substituting the numbers:

b is 48, c is 50. So cos A = 48/50 = 24/25 = 0.96. Which is option D.

Wait, but let me verify once more. Another way: coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the triangle to confirm.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Since it's a right angle at C, then point A can be along the x-axis and point B along the y-axis. So:

Point C: (0,0)

Point A: (b, 0) since CA is length b=48. So A is at (48, 0)

Point B: (0, a) since CB is length a=14. So B is at (0,14)

Then AB is the hypotenuse from (48,0) to (0,14). The length of AB is sqrt((48)^2 + (14)^2) which is sqrt(2304 + 196) = sqrt(2500)=50, which matches c=50.

Now, angle A is at point A (48,0). To find cos A, we can use vectors or coordinate geometry.

Vector AB is from A to B: (0 - 48, 14 - 0) = (-48,14)

Vector AC is from A to C: (0 - 48, 0 - 0) = (-48, 0)

The angle at A is between vectors AB and AC. So cos A is the dot product of AB and AC divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Compute the dot product:

AB • AC = (-48)(-48) + (14)(0) = 2304 + 0 = 2304

Magnitude of AB is 50 (given)

Magnitude of AC is 48 (given)

Thus cos A = 2304 / (50 * 48) = 2304 / 2400 = divide numerator and denominator by 48: 48 / 50 = 0.96. Same as before. So cos A is 0.96, which is option D.

But wait, let me check another way. Using the Law of Cosines. In triangle ABC, angle A. Law of Cosines states that:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)

Wait, but wait, need to be careful with notation here. Wait, in standard notation, for triangle ABC, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, etc. But in our problem, the notation is different. Wait, the original problem defines:

Length of Line(C,B) is a. So CB has length a. In standard terms, side opposite angle A is BC, which would be denoted as a. Wait, yes! In standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A. So if angle A is at vertex A, then side a is BC. Similarly, side b is AC, and side c is AB.

Wait, so in standard terms, for triangle ABC:

- Side a is BC (opposite angle A)

- Side b is AC (opposite angle B)

- Side c is AB (opposite angle C)

Wait, but in our problem, they define:

Length of Line(C, B) = a → that's CB, which is side opposite angle A. So yes, that would be side a.

Similarly, Length of Line(A, B) = c → that's AB, which is side opposite angle C. So side c is AB.

Length of Line(C, A) = b → that's CA, which is side opposite angle B. So side b is AC.

So in standard terms, the sides are:

a = BC = 14

b = AC = 48

c = AB = 50

And angle A is at vertex A. Now, applying Law of Cosines for angle A:

Law of Cosines formula is:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

Wait, but let me confirm. Wait, Law of Cosines for angle A is:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

Wait, solving for cos A:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

Wait, but in this case, side a is BC = 14, side b is AC = 48, side c is AB = 50.

So plugging in:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc) = (48² + 50² - 14²) / (2*48*50)

Calculate numerator:

First, calculate each term:

48² = 2304

50² = 2500

14² = 196

So numerator = 2304 + 2500 - 196 = ?

2304 + 2500 = 4804; 4804 - 196 = 4608

Denominator: 2 * 48 * 50 = 2*2400 = 4800

So cos A = 4608 / 4800 = Simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 4608 ÷ 48 = 96; 4800 ÷ 48 = 100. So 96/100 = 0.96. Same result as before. So cos A is 0.96, which corresponds to option D.

But let me cross-check with the previous method where we considered the right triangle. Since the triangle is right-angled at C, angle A is adjacent to side AC (length b=48) and hypotenuse AB (length c=50). Therefore, cos A = adjacent/hypotenuse = AC / AB = 48/50 = 0.96. Yep, same answer.

So regardless of the method used, the answer is 0.96, which is option D.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A. 0.14

B. 0.48

C. 0.50

D. 0.96

So the correct answer is D. Hence, Final Answer: D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $\cos A$ in triangle $ABC$, we start by interpreting the given geometric constraints carefully:

- **Line(C, B)** has length $a = 14$
- **Line(A, B)** has length $c = 50$
- **Line(C, A)** has length $b = 48$
- **Lines CA and CB** are **perpendicular**, indicating that angle $C$ is a right angle.

This makes triangle $ABC$ a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $C$. In such triangles, the Pythagorean theorem applies directly:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Substituting the given values:

$$
14^2 + 48^2 = 196 + 2304 = 2500 = 50^2
$$

This confirms the triangle is valid and right-angled at $C$.

### Step 1: Understand the Angle and Triangle Configuration

We are asked to find $\cos A$, where angle $A$ is located at vertex $A$. In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the **adjacent side** to the **hypotenuse**.

From the diagram and triangle configuration:
- The **adjacent side** to angle $A$ is $AC$, whose length is $b = 48$
- The **hypotenuse** is $AB$, whose length is $c = 50$

Thus,

$$
\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{48}{50}
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the Result

$$
\frac{48}{50} = 0.96
$$

This value aligns precisely with the given answer choice **D**.

---

### Final Verification via Law of Cosines (Optional)

As an alternative verification, we could apply the **Law of Cosines**:

$$
\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
\cos A = \frac{48^2 + 50^2 - 14^2}{2 \cdot 48 \cdot 50}
= \frac{2304 + 2500 - 196}{4800}
= \frac{4608}{4800}
= 0.96
$$

Again, confirming the result.

---

### Conclusion

All methods consistently yield:

$$
\cos A = 0.96
$$

Matching the answer choice **D**.

**Final Answer: D**
