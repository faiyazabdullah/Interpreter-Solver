Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several angles given with expressions involving x, and we need to find the measure of angle W. Let me start by writing down all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, the problem mentions angles with specific vertices. The notation Angle(V, U, Z) means the angle at vertex U between points V and Z. Similarly for the others. Let me list each equation:

1. Measure of ∠VUZ = x - 8
2. Measure of ∠UVW = 3x - 11
3. Measure of ∠YWV = x + 8
4. Measure of ∠ZYW = x
5. Measure of ∠UZY = 2x + 7

Wait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting these correctly. For example, ∠VUZ would be the angle at point U formed by points V, U, Z. So that's angle at U between V and Z. Similarly, ∠UVW is the angle at V between U and W. Then ∠YWV is the angle at W between Y and V. Wait, maybe there's a diagram that goes along with this? Since the user hasn't provided a diagram, I might need to infer the relationships based on standard geometric configurations.

But since there are multiple angles mentioned, perhaps they form some triangle or intersecting lines? Maybe there are triangles involved here. Let me think about possible scenarios.

Let me consider that points U, V, W, X (maybe?), Y, Z are part of a geometric figure. But without seeing the diagram, this could be tricky. However, maybe the angles given can help us set up equations based on triangle angle sums or supplementary angles.

Alternatively, maybe these angles are part of a transversal or parallel lines? Or perhaps there are vertical angles, corresponding angles, etc. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle with some known angles?

Let me look again at the angles given. Let me note their positions:

Angle 1: At U, between V and Z → ∠VUZ
Angle 2: At V, between U and W → ∠UVW
Angle 3: At W, between Y and V → ∠YWV
Angle 4: At Y, between Z and W → ∠ZYW
Angle 5: At Z, between U and Y → ∠UZY

Hmm, perhaps these points form a polygon or multiple triangles. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Suppose there's a quadrilateral or pentagon? Or maybe multiple triangles connected. Let me see if I can find relations between these angles.

Another approach: since angles are given with variables, maybe there are triangles where the sum of angles equals 180 degrees. Let me check if any of these angles belong to the same triangle.

For instance, looking at ∠UVW (at V), which is 3x - 11. If there's a triangle involving points U, V, W, then the sum of angles would be 180. But do we know other angles in that triangle?

Also, ∠VUZ (at U) is x - 8. If that's part of another triangle... Maybe triangle UVZ? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe there are two triangles sharing a common side or something. Also, considering angles at different points.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points U, V, W, and another triangle involving points Y, W, V, etc.

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line or a transversal creating supplementary angles. Let me check for linear pairs.

Looking at ∠YWV (at W) which is x + 8. And ∠ZYW (at Y) which is x. Are these adjacent angles forming a straight line? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. But unless specified, that's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, or in a quadrilateral is 360°, or using exterior angles.

Let me try to find triangles where these angles could fit.

Starting with triangle UVW. In triangle UVW, the angles would be at U, V, W. But wait, we have ∠UVW at V, which is 3x - 11. What about the other angles?

If we can find the measures of the other angles in triangle UVW, then their sum should be 180°. But do we know those?

We have ∠VUZ (which is at U, between V and Z). Is that part of triangle UVW? Maybe not directly. Unless Z is a point on the extension of some line.

Alternatively, maybe triangle UZW? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe triangle UZV? If so, then ∠VUZ is one angle, and maybe other angles?

This seems too vague. Perhaps I need to look for relationships between the angles given.

Let me write down all the angle expressions:

1. ∠VUZ = x - 8
2. ∠UVW = 3x - 11
3. ∠YWV = x + 8
4. ∠ZYW = x
5. ∠UZY = 2x + 7

Now, trying to relate them. Let me check if there are any vertical angles, or if any of these angles are parts of the same triangle.

For example, ∠UZY (at Z) is 2x + 7. That's the angle at Z between U and Y. So, if there's a triangle involving points U, Z, Y, then that angle is part of that triangle. Let me consider triangle UZY. In triangle UZY, the angles would be at U, Z, Y. We know ∠UZY (at Z) is 2x + 7, and ∠ZYW (at Y) is x. Wait, but ∠ZYW is at Y, between Z and W. So that's outside triangle UZY, unless W is connected to Y.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ZYV? Or something else.

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle involving points Z, Y, W. Because ∠ZYW is at Y, between Z and W, which is angle ZYW. So that's part of triangle ZYW. In triangle ZYW, the angles would be at Z, Y, W. We have ∠ZYW (at Y) as x, and maybe other angles?

Similarly, ∠YWV is at W between Y and V, which is angle YWV. So that's part of triangle YWV? If so, then in triangle YWV, angles at Y, W, V. ∠YWV (at W) is x + 8, and ∠UVW (at V) is 3x - 11. Wait, but ∠UVW is at V between U and W. So, if we have triangle UVW, which includes angle at V (∠UVW), angle at U (∠VUZ?), and angle at W (∠UVW?) No, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe triangle UZW? Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to consider that some of these angles are supplementary or related through other geometric principles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal cutting two lines, making alternate interior angles or something. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is challenging.

Wait, maybe the key is that some angles are vertical angles or adjacent angles forming a straight line.

For example, suppose that points U, V, W are colinear? Or maybe some other collinearity.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with vertices U, V, W, and another triangle with vertices Y, W, V, etc.

Alternatively, maybe there's a star-shaped figure with multiple triangles.

Let me try to think of all the angles given and see if they can be connected via triangle angle sums.

Let me focus on triangle UVW first. If I can find the three angles of triangle UVW, their sum should be 180°. But we only know one angle: ∠UVW = 3x - 11. What about the other angles?

At point U, we have ∠VUZ. If Z is a point such that line UZ forms another side, maybe extending from U. Suppose that Z lies on the extension of VW, making ∠VUZ an external angle?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving U, V, Z. Let me assume that.

So, if we have triangle UVZ, then the angles would be at U, V, Z. We know ∠VUZ (at U) is x - 8, and maybe other angles?

But unless we have more info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving U, Z, Y. Since ∠UZY is given as 2x + 7, and ∠ZYW is x.

Wait, if we consider triangle UZY, then the angles at U, Z, Y. We know ∠UZY (at Z) is 2x + 7, and ∠ZYW is at Y, which is part of triangle ZYW. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe angles ∠ZYW and ∠UZY are adjacent, forming a larger angle?

Alternatively, maybe the angles ∠UZY and ∠ZYW are adjacent, making a straight line? If so, then their sum would be 180°. Wait, let's explore that possibility.

Assuming that points U, Z, Y are arranged such that ∠UZY and ∠ZYW form a linear pair. If that's true, then:

∠UZY + ∠ZYW = 180°

Which would mean:

(2x + 7) + x = 180

=> 3x + 7 = 180

=> 3x = 173

=> x = 173 / 3 ≈ 57.666...

But then checking other angles, like ∠VUZ = x - 8 ≈ 57.666 - 8 ≈ 49.666..., which may not lead to integer values, but maybe possible. However, since answer choices are integers, this might not be the right assumption. Also, the question asks for measure of ∠W, which could be ∠YWV (x + 8). If x ≈ 57.666, then ∠W would be approx 65.666, which isn't among the choices. Therefore, this assumption might be wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe angles ∠UVW (at V) and ∠YWV (at W) are part of a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle VWY, then the angles at V, W, Y. Wait, ∠UVW is at V between U and W, which might not be part of triangle VWY unless U is connected to Y.

This is getting too confusing without a diagram. Maybe I need to consider that all these angles are part of a single complex figure, possibly with multiple triangles.

Another approach: Let's look for equations that can be formed based on triangle angle sums or other relations.

Suppose we consider triangle UVW. Its angles are:

At V: ∠UVW = 3x - 11

At U: ??? 

At W: ??? 

But unless we can express the other angles in terms of x, we can't proceed. However, maybe ∠VUZ relates to angle at U in triangle UVW?

If Z is a point such that line UZ is an extension of some side. For example, if line UZ is a continuation of line UW, then ∠VUZ would be an exterior angle to triangle UVW. Wait, that might be a way to connect them.

Let me elaborate. Suppose that in triangle UVW, the side UW is extended past W to a point Z. Then, ∠VUZ would be an exterior angle at U. Wait, no—if you extend UW beyond W to Z, then the exterior angle at U would involve extending a different side. Let me clarify.

Actually, the exterior angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

So, if we have triangle UVW, and we extend one of its sides to create an exterior angle. Let's say we extend side VW beyond W to a point Z. Then, the exterior angle at W would be ∠VWZ. But our given angle is ∠VUZ, which is at U. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if we extend side UV beyond U to a point Z, then the exterior angle at U would be ∠ZUV. But our given angle is ∠VUZ, which is at U between V and Z. So that would be the case if Z is on the extension of UV beyond U, making ∠VUZ an exterior angle.

In that scenario, according to the exterior angle theorem, ∠VUZ = ∠UVW + ∠UWV.

Wait, let me confirm. If we extend UV beyond U to Z, then ∠VUZ is the exterior angle at U, and it should equal the sum of the remote interior angles, which would be ∠UVW and ∠UWV.

Yes! So, if that's the case, then:

∠VUZ = ∠UVW + ∠UWV

Given that ∠VUZ = x - 8, ∠UVW = 3x - 11, and ∠UWV is the angle at W between U and V, which is ∠UWV. Wait, but the given angle at W is ∠YWV = x + 8. Is ∠UWV the same as ∠YWV?

Not necessarily, unless points Y and U are aligned in some way. This is where confusion arises without a diagram.

But assuming that ∠UWV is the same as ∠YWV, which would be the case if Y lies on the line extending from WU or something. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle involving point Y.

Let me try to use this exterior angle relationship. Assuming that ∠VUZ is an exterior angle to triangle UVW, then:

x - 8 = (3x - 11) + ∠UWV

But if ∠UWV is the same as ∠YWV, which is given as x + 8, then:

x - 8 = (3x - 11) + (x + 8)

Let me compute the right-hand side:

3x - 11 + x + 8 = 4x - 3

Therefore:

x - 8 = 4x - 3

Subtract x from both sides:

-8 = 3x - 3

Add 3 to both sides:

-5 = 3x => x = -5/3

That gives x negative, which doesn't make sense because angle measures can't be negative. Hence, this assumption must be incorrect.

Therefore, my earlier assumption that ∠UWV equals ∠YWV is likely wrong. So maybe there's another relation.

Alternatively, maybe ∠VUZ is an exterior angle to another triangle. Let me think differently.

Looking at angle ∠UZY = 2x + 7. This is at point Z between U and Y. So, if we consider triangle UZY, then angles at U, Z, Y. Let's denote:

In triangle UZY, angles are:

At U: ?

At Z: ∠UZY = 2x + 7

At Y: ?

But also, there's ∠ZYW = x, which is at Y between Z and W. So, if we assume that ∠ZYW is part of triangle ZYW, which has angles at Z, Y, W. Let me consider triangle ZYW:

Angles at Z: ?

At Y: ∠ZYW = x

At W: ∠YWV = x + 8 (if that's part of it).

Wait, but ∠YWV is at W between Y and V. If we're considering triangle ZYW, the angle at W would be ∠YWZ. Is ∠YWV the same as ∠YWZ? Only if V and Z are aligned in a certain way. Again, without knowing the diagram, it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line through Y, W, and another point. For example, if points Z, W, V are colinear, then ∠YWV and ∠ZYW could be supplementary.

Wait, if Z-W-V are colinear, then ∠ZYW would be a straight line, but that's not the case here. Or if Y is somewhere off that line.

This seems too vague. Let me try another approach.

Since there are five equations with x, maybe I can find a system of equations by relating them through triangle angle sums or other relations.

Let me list all the angles again:

1. ∠VUZ = x - 8
2. ∠UVW = 3x - 11
3. ∠YWV = x + 8
4. ∠ZYW = x
5. ∠UZY = 2x + 7

Let me consider triangle UZY. It has angles at U, Z, Y. Let's call ∠UZY = 2x + 7 (given), and ∠ZYW = x (at Y). But ∠ZYW is not necessarily an angle of triangle UZY unless W is a point on the triangle. Wait, if triangle UZY has vertices U, Z, Y, then the third angle at U would be something else. Let me denote ∠UZY = 2x + 7, ∠ZYW = x is at Y, but ∠ZYW is an angle outside triangle UZY, unless W is on the triangle.

Alternatively, if there's a line from Y to W, then ∠ZYW is part of triangle ZYW.

Maybe I need to consider multiple triangles and set up equations accordingly.

Another thought: Maybe the angles given are part of a larger polygon, and the sum of all internal angles is used. But without knowing the number of sides, that's difficult.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points U, Z, Y, and W. For instance, if lines connect these points in some way.

Alternatively, consider that points U, V, W, Y, Z form a pentagon, but again, without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Wait, maybe focusing on the angles at point W. The question asks for m∠W, which could refer to ∠YWV (x + 8) or another angle at W. Given that ∠YWV is x + 8, and if that's the angle at W we need, then solving for x would give us the value.

But to find x, we need another equation. Let me see if I can find another equation involving x.

Let me think about triangle YWV. If that exists, then the sum of its angles would be 180°. The angles would be at Y, W, V.

At Y: ∠ZYW = x (assuming that ∠ZYW is part of this triangle?)

Wait, if triangle YWV has angles at Y, W, V. Then:

At Y: angle between Z and W? Or between W and V?

Wait, ∠ZYW is at Y between Z and W. So, if we consider triangle YWV, then at Y, the angle would be between W and V, which might be different from ∠ZYW unless Z is aligned with V.

Alternatively, if line YZ extends to V, then ∠ZYW and ∠YZV could be related.

This is too much guesswork. Let me try to find another way.

Let me consider that maybe ∠UZY and ∠ZYW are adjacent angles forming a linear pair. Earlier assumption led to x ≈ 57.66, but maybe that's acceptable. Let me recalculate that.

If ∠UZY + ∠ZYW = 180°, then:

(2x + 7) + x = 180

3x + 7 = 180

3x = 173

x = 173 / 3 ≈ 57.666...

Then, ∠YWV = x + 8 ≈ 57.666 + 8 ≈ 65.666°, which is approximately 65.67°, but none of the answer choices are close to this. So this suggests that this assumption is wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe ∠UVW and ∠UWV are angles in triangle UVW, and ∠VUZ is related to them.

Earlier attempt gave negative x, which was invalid. Maybe I made a mistake in that calculation.

Let me redo that:

Assume ∠VUZ is an exterior angle to triangle UVW at point U. Then, ∠VUZ = ∠UVW + ∠UWV.

Given ∠VUZ = x - 8, ∠UVW = 3x - 11, and ∠UWV is the angle at W in triangle UVW. But ∠UWV might not be the same as ∠YWV unless Y is on the line WV or something.

But if I take ∠UWV as the angle at W in triangle UVW, then:

x - 8 = (3x - 11) + ∠UWV

Rearranged:

∠UWV = x - 8 - (3x - 11) = x - 8 - 3x + 11 = -2x + 3

Now, if ∠UWV is also equal to ∠YWV, which is x + 8, then:

-2x + 3 = x + 8

Solving:

-2x - x = 8 - 3

-3x = 5 => x = -5/3

Again, negative x. Not valid. So this suggests that ∠UWV ≠ ∠YWV.

But maybe ∠UWV is supplementary to ∠YWV? If they form a linear pair.

So, ∠UWV + ∠YWV = 180°

From above, ∠UWV = -2x + 3, and ∠YWV = x + 8

Thus:

(-2x + 3) + (x + 8) = 180

Combine terms:

-2x + x + 3 + 8 = -x + 11 = 180

→ -x = 169 → x = -169

Still negative. Not good.

So this path is not working. Let me think of another approach.

What if we consider triangle YWV? Let's assume that triangle YWV exists. Its angles would be at Y, W, V.

We know ∠YWV = x + 8 (at W), and ∠UVW = 3x - 11 (at V). Wait, but ∠UVW is at V between U and W. Is that the same as the angle at V in triangle YWV? Possibly, if Y is connected to V. So, if triangle YWV has angles at Y, W, V. Then:

∠YWV = x + 8 (at W)

∠UVW = 3x - 11 (at V)

And the third angle at Y would be something. Let's call it ∠VYV? Wait, at Y, the angle would be between W and V, which is ∠VYV? Wait, no. In triangle YWV, the angles are at Y, W, V. So, at Y, the angle is between W and V, which would be ∠WYV. But we have ∠ZYW = x, which is at Y between Z and W. So if ∠WYV is part of that, then perhaps ∠ZYW is related.

If points Z, Y, V are arranged such that ∠ZYW and ∠WYV are adjacent, forming a straight line, then their sum would be 180°. So:

∠ZYW + ∠WYV = 180°

Given that ∠ZYW = x, and ∠WYV is the angle at Y in triangle YWV, which is:

Sum of angles in triangle YWV is 180°, so:

∠YWV + ∠UVW + ∠WYV = 180°

Plugging in:

(x + 8) + (3x - 11) + ∠WYV = 180

Simplify:

x + 8 + 3x - 11 + ∠WYV = 4x - 3 + ∠WYV = 180

So ∠WYV = 180 - (4x - 3) = 183 - 4x

But earlier, we had ∠ZYW + ∠WYV = 180°, so:

x + (183 - 4x) = 180

Combine terms:

-3x + 183 = 180

→ -3x = -3 → x = 1

Wait, x=1? Let me check this.

So if x=1, then:

Check if this works.

Let me verify each angle:

1. ∠VUZ = x - 8 = 1 - 8 = -7. Negative angle? That can't be. So this is impossible. Thus, contradiction.

So this suggests that the assumption that ∠ZYW + ∠WYV = 180° is wrong, or that there's an error in reasoning.

But why did we get x=1? Probably because of incorrect assumptions about the configuration.

Let me retrace. We assumed that in triangle YWV, ∠UVW is one of its angles. But ∠UVW is at V between U and W, while in triangle YWV, the angle at V would be between W and Y, unless U is aligned with Y.

This indicates that my assumption is flawed. Perhaps ∠UVW is not part of triangle YWV. Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Let me try another angle. Let's consider triangle UZY. It has angles at U, Z, Y. We know ∠UZY = 2x + 7 (at Z), and we might relate ∠ZYW to another angle.

If we consider line ZY, and point W somewhere, then ∠ZYW is at Y between Z and W. If there's a line from Y to W, then ∠ZYW could be an exterior angle to triangle UZY.

Let me assume that ∠ZYW is an exterior angle to triangle UZY at Y. Then, by the exterior angle theorem:

∠ZYW = ∠UZY + ∠UYZ

Where ∠UYZ is the angle at Y in triangle UZY.

So:

x = (2x + 7) + ∠UYZ

Solving for ∠UYZ:

∠UYZ = x - (2x + 7) = -x - 7

Negative angle again. Impossible. So this can't be.

Alternatively, maybe ∠UYZ is the exterior angle. Wait, if ∠ZYW is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But unless I know which angles those are.

Alternatively, if ∠UYZ is part of another triangle.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to consider all the given angles and see if there's a way to set up equations based on triangle sums.

Let me list all the angles and see if any of them can be part of triangles where I can apply the angle sum.

Let me consider triangle UZV. Angles at U, Z, V.

We know ∠VUZ = x - 8 (at U). If I can find other angles.

But without knowing other sides or angles, it's hard.

Alternatively, consider triangle YWV. As before, but need to relate it to other angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral involved. For example, quadrilateral UZVW or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the angles at point Z. We have ∠UZY = 2x + 7 (at Z between U and Y), and ∠ZYW = x (at Z between Y and W)? No, ∠ZYW is at Y.

Wait, at point Z, we have ∠UZY = 2x + 7, which is between U and Y. Are there other angles at Z? If there's a line from Z to W, then maybe ∠VZU or something. Not sure.

This is really challenging without the diagram. Let me try to think if there's any other way.

Wait, perhaps all the angles given are parts of a triangle or multiple triangles where their measures can be added together.

Wait, let me think about the sum of all the given angles. But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, notice that the answer choices are A. 38, B. 38, C. 76, D. 152. So likely x is a small integer, leading to m∠W being one of these.

Let me try to assume x is an integer, and try to find x such that all angle measures are positive.

Let me go back to the previous assumption where I considered triangle YWV and tried to relate angles, even though it led to x=1. But maybe there's a mistake there.

Let me try again. Assume that in triangle YWV, the angles are:

At W: ∠YWV = x + 8

At V: ∠UVW = 3x - 11

At Y: let's call it y.

So, sum of angles:

(x + 8) + (3x - 11) + y = 180

So, 4x - 3 + y = 180 → y = 183 - 4x

Now, if y is the angle at Y in triangle YWV, which is ∠WYV. Now, if ∠ZYW = x is related to this angle.

If points Z, Y, V are arranged such that ∠ZYW and ∠WYV are supplementary, then:

∠ZYW + ∠WYV = 180°

So:

x + (183 - 4x) = 180

Which simplifies to:

-3x + 183 = 180 → -3x = -3 → x = 1

As before. But this leads to ∠VUZ = x - 8 = -7, which is invalid. So this suggests either the diagram is different, or there's another relation.

But since x=1 gives a negative angle, it's invalid. Maybe instead of being supplementary, they are equal? Or some other relation.

If ∠ZYW = ∠WYV, then:

x = 183 - 4x → 5x = 183 → x = 36.6, which is not integer.

Or maybe ∠ZYW is part of ∠WYV? Like, if Z is inside the angle at Y.

For example, if at point Y, there are two angles: ∠ZYW = x and another angle, say, ∠WYV = y. Then, if Z is inside the angle at Y, then:

∠WYV = ∠ZYW + something.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. Let's suppose that ∠WYV = ∠ZYW + something.

But this is too vague. Let me try another approach.

Let me consider all the given angles and try to find a system of equations.

We have five expressions, but how many independent equations can we form?

Possibly, if we can find two or more equations relating x.

Let me think: 

If there's a triangle where two of the angles are expressed in terms of x, then we can form an equation.

For example, if there's a triangle with angles ∠VUZ, ∠UVW, and another angle.

But earlier attempts showed contradictions.

Wait, let me try to assume that points U, V, W, Z, Y form a pentagon, and use the sum of interior angles. But for a pentagon, the sum is (5-2)*180 = 540°. But without knowing which angles are part of the pentagon, this is not useful.

Another idea: Maybe there are two triangles sharing a common side, and their angles can be combined.

Let me consider triangles UZV and YWV.

Alternatively, think about the entire figure having multiple triangles with shared angles.

Wait, let me revisit the initial equations and see if I can find any patterns.

We have:

1. ∠VUZ = x - 8
2. ∠UVW = 3x - 11
3. ∠YWV = x + 8
4. ∠ZYW = x
5. ∠UZY = 2x + 7

Let me think about the sum of ∠VUZ and ∠UZY. If these angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle.

For example, if points V, U, Z and Z, U, Y are connected, forming a larger angle at U. But without knowing the diagram, it's hard.

Alternatively, if ∠VUZ and ∠UZY are part of a triangle or a straight line.

Wait, if points V, Z, Y are colinear, then ∠VUZ and ∠UZY would form a straight line at Z? No, that's not clear.

Alternatively, if line VZ passes through Y, then ∠VUZ and ∠UZY would be related.

But this is too speculative.

Let me try to think of all the angles in terms of x and see if I can find a relationship.

Let me assume that there's a triangle involving points U, Z, Y, and W. For example, if lines UZ, ZY, YW, and WU form a quadrilateral. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, let me try to consider that ∠UZY = 2x + 7 and ∠ZYW = x, and maybe these are parts of a triangle.

If I consider triangle ZYW, its angles are at Z, Y, W.

At Z: ∠ZYW is not directly an angle of this triangle. Wait, ∠ZYW is at Y, between Z and W, which is the angle at Y of triangle ZYW. So in triangle ZYW, the angles are:

At Y: ∠ZYW = x

At Z: ? Let's call it ∠YZW

At W: ∠YWZ

So, sum of angles:

x + ∠YZW + ∠YWZ = 180

Now, if we can express ∠YZW or ∠YWZ in terms of other angles.

For example, ∠YZW might be related to ∠VUZ or something else.

Alternatively, if line ZY is extended to meet another line, forming an angle.

Alternatively, if ∠YZW is the same as ∠VUZ, which is x - 8. But why?

This is too arbitrary.

Let me try to think of all possible ways to relate these angles. Let me try to write down all possible equations.

Equation 1: From triangle UVW, if we can find its angles.

Equation 2: From triangle UZY, if we can find its angles.

Equation 3: From triangle YWV, if we can find its angles.

Equation 4: From triangle ZYW, if we can find its angles.

But without knowing which angles are part of which triangles, it's hard. Let me try to assume that ∠VUZ is part of triangle UZV, and ∠UZY is part of triangle UZY.

Let me try to consider triangle UZV. It has angles at U, Z, V.

At U: ∠VUZ = x - 8

At Z: ? Let's say ∠UZV

At V: ∠UVZ

Sum: (x - 8) + ∠UZV + ∠UVZ = 180

But without additional info, can't proceed.

However, if I can relate ∠UVZ to other angles.

For example, if ∠UVZ is the same as ∠UVW = 3x - 11, but only if W is aligned with Z. If W is on the line VZ, then ∠UVW would be part of ∠UVZ. But this is assuming W is on VZ, which might not be the case.

Assuming W is on line VZ, then ∠UVW would be part of ∠UVZ. So:

∠UVZ = ∠UVW + ∠WVZ

But ∠WVZ is part of another angle, like ∠VZU or something.

This is getting too convoluted. I need a new strategy.

Let me consider that all the angles given are parts of various triangles, and try to find x by setting up equations based on triangle angle sums.

Let me try to focus on triangle UZY. It has angles at U, Z, Y.

We know ∠UZY = 2x + 7 (at Z). Let's call the other angles at U and Y as a and b.

So:

a + b + (2x + 7) = 180

Now, if I can find a or b in terms of x.

Looking at ∠ZYW = x, which is at Y between Z and W. If this angle is related to b, then maybe b = x, or b = 180 - x, depending on the configuration.

Assuming that ∠ZYW is part of angle b, then if ZY is extended to W, then b = ∠ZYW = x. So:

b = x

Then, a + x + 2x + 7 = 180 → a + 3x + 7 = 180 → a = 173 - 3x

Now, a is the angle at U in triangle UZY, which is ∠UZY? No, a is ∠UZY? Wait, no. In triangle UZY, the angles are at U, Z, Y. So a is the angle at U, which is ∠UZY? No, ∠UZY is at Z. So, a is ∠UZ Y? No, ∠UZY is at Z, so a is the angle at U, which would be ∠ZUY.

So, ∠ZUY = a = 173 - 3x.

Now, if this angle ∠ZUY is related to another angle, like ∠VUZ = x - 8, which is at U between V and Z. If points V, U, Z are arranged such that ∠ZUY and ∠VUZ are adjacent, forming a straight line or something.

For example, if line VZ passes through U, then ∠ZUY and ∠VUZ would be adjacent, forming a straight line. So, their sum would be 180°.

Thus:

∠ZUY + ∠VUZ = 180°

Which is:

(173 - 3x) + (x - 8) = 180

Simplify:

173 - 3x + x - 8 = 180 → 165 - 2x = 180

→ -2x = 15 → x = -7.5

Negative again. Not possible.

So this assumption is invalid. Maybe ∠ZUY and ∠VUZ are supplementary in another way?

Alternatively, if ∠ZUY is part of ∠VUZ, then ∠VUZ = ∠ZUY + something.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say.

Let me try to assume that ∠ZUY is equal to ∠VUZ. Then:

173 - 3x = x - 8

→ 173 + 8 = 4x → 181 = 4x → x = 181/4 = 45.25

Then, check if this leads to positive angles.

Calculate ∠VUZ = x - 8 = 45.25 - 8 = 37.25°, which is positive.

∠UZY = 2x + 7 = 90.5 + 7 = 97.5°, positive.

∠ZYW = x = 45.25°, positive.

Now, what about other angles?

Let me check if this x value makes sense with other parts.

For example, ∠UVW = 3x - 11 = 3*45.25 - 11 = 135.75 - 11 = 124.75°, positive.

∠YWV = x + 8 = 45.25 + 8 = 53.25°, positive.

Now, let's see if there's a triangle where these angles can fit.

Let me consider triangle UVW. Its angles are at U, V, W. We have ∠UVW = 124.75°, and if we can find the other angles.

If ∠UVW is at V, then the other angles at U and W would be needed. But we don't have direct info.

But if we assume that ∠VUZ = 37.25° is part of this triangle, but how?

If ∠VUZ is an angle at U in triangle UVW, then it would be one of the angles. Let's say ∠VUZ is the angle at U in triangle UVW. Then, the sum of angles in triangle UVW would be:

∠VUZ + ∠UVW + ∠UWV = 180

So:

37.25 + 124.75 + ∠UWV = 180

→ 162 + ∠UWV = 180 → ∠UWV = 18°

Now, ∠UWV is the angle at W in triangle UVW, which is ∠UWV. If this is the same as ∠YWV = 53.25°, then 18° ≠ 53.25°, so contradiction. Hence, this assumption is wrong.

But if ∠UWV is different from ∠YWV, then it's possible. But how does this help?

Maybe ∠UWV is related to ∠YWV through some other relation. For example, if they are supplementary.

If ∠UWV + ∠YWV = 180°, then:

18 + 53.25 = 71.25 ≠ 180. Not possible.

Alternatively, if they are part of a straight line, but 18 + 53.25 = 71.25, which is less than 180.

This suggests that this x value is not correct.

But this shows that assuming ∠ZUY = ∠VUZ led to a possible x, but it didn't resolve other parts. However, since this is the only plausible x I've found so far, maybe there's a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me recap: I assumed that in triangle UZY, angle at Y is x, and angle at Z is 2x + 7, leading to angle at U being 173 - 3x, and then assuming that this angle at U (173 - 3x) is equal to ∠VUZ = x - 8, leading to x = 45.25. This gave positive angles, but didn't satisfy other conditions. But perhaps there's another relation I missed.

Let me try to use this x = 45.25 and see if other parts can be reconciled.

With x = 45.25, ∠VUZ = 37.25°, ∠UVW = 124.75°, ∠YWV = 53.25°, ∠ZYW = 45.25°, ∠UZY = 97.5°.

Now, let's look at triangle ZYW. It has angles at Z, Y, W.

At Y: ∠ZYW = 45.25°

At Z: let's say it's some angle, say, α

At W: ∠YWZ = β

So, α + β + 45.25 = 180 → α + β = 134.75°

Now, if we can relate α and β to other angles.

For example, if α is the angle at Z in triangle ZYW, which is ∠YZW. If this angle is related to ∠UZY = 97.5°, which is at Z between U and Y. If line ZY is extended to W, then ∠YZW could be supplementary to ∠UZY.

So, ∠YZW + ∠UZY = 180°

Thus:

α + 97.5 = 180 → α = 82.5°

Then, β = 134.75 - α = 134.75 - 82.5 = 52.25°

Now, β is ∠YWZ, which is the angle at W in triangle ZYW.

Now, if this angle ∠YWZ is related to ∠YWV = 53.25°, which is at W between Y and V. If these angles are adjacent, forming a straight line, then:

∠YWZ + ∠YWV = 180°

So:

52.25 + 53.25 = 105.5° ≠ 180°. Not matching.

Alternatively, if they are part of a triangle, but not sure.

Alternatively, if ∠YWZ is part of another triangle.

But this is still not resolving. However, with x = 45.25, ∠YWV = 53.25°, which is one of the answer choices if rounded. The closest option is C. 76 or D. 152, but 53.25 is closer to none. Wait, the answer choices are A. 38, B. 38, C. 76, D. 152. None match 53.25. So this suggests that this x is incorrect.

This is very frustrating. Maybe I need to consider that there are two separate equations to solve for x, and I missed one.

Let me try to find another equation. Let's consider triangle UZV. If it exists, with angles at U, Z, V.

We have ∠VUZ = x - 8 (at U), and if I can find other angles.

Assume that at Z, the angle is ∠UZV, and at V, it's ∠UVZ.

So, (x - 8) + ∠UZV + ∠UVZ = 180.

Now, if ∠UVZ is related to ∠UVW = 3x - 11, which is at V between U and W. If W is on the line VZ, then ∠UVZ = ∠UVW + ∠WVZ.

But if W is on VZ, then ∠WVZ is zero, which doesn't make sense. Or if W is on the extension of VZ, then ∠UVW could be an external angle.

Let me assume that W is on the extension of VZ, so that ∠UVW is an exterior angle at V for triangle UVZ.

Then, by the exterior angle theorem:

∠UVW = ∠VUZ + ∠UVZ

Wait, but ∠UVW is at V, so if it's an exterior angle, it should equal the sum of the remote interior angles.

The remote interior angles would be ∠VUZ (at U) and ∠UVZ (at Z).

Wait, no. The exterior angle at V would be ∠UVW, and the remote interior angles are at U and Z.

Wait, let me clarify. If W is on the extension of VZ, then the exterior angle at V would be ∠UVW, and the remote interior angles are ∠VUZ (at U) and ∠UZV (at Z). So:

∠UVW = ∠VUZ + ∠UZV

So:

3x - 11 = (x - 8) + ∠UZV

Thus:

∠UZV = 3x - 11 - (x - 8) = 2x - 3

Now, ∠UZV is the angle at Z in triangle UZV, which we previously called α in the earlier scenario. If this angle is related to ∠UZY = 2x + 7, which is at Z between U and Y. If line ZY is part of the same line as ZV, then ∠UZV and ∠UZY could be adjacent, forming a straight line, making their sum 180°.

So:

∠UZV + ∠UZY = 180°

Substitute:

(2x - 3) + (2x + 7) = 180

4x + 4 = 180

4x = 176

x = 44

Ah! This gives x = 44, which is a positive integer. Let's check if this works!

Let me verify this step by step.

First, x = 44.

Check ∠UVW = 3x - 11 = 3*44 - 11 = 132 - 11 = 121°

∠VUZ = x - 8 = 44 - 8 = 36°

∠UZV = 2x - 3 = 88 - 3 = 85°

∠UZY = 2x + 7 = 88 + 7 = 95°

Now, if ∠UZV + ∠UZY = 85 + 95 = 180°, which confirms they are supplementary, meaning that points V, Z, Y are colinear, with Z between V and Y. So, line VZ is extended to Y, making ∠UZV and ∠UZY form a straight line.

Great! This makes sense now. So, this gives x = 44.

Now, let's check other angles.

Next, let's look at ∠ZYW = x = 44°, and ∠YWV = x + 8 = 52°.

Now, let's consider triangle YWV. Its angles are at Y, W, V.

At Y: ∠ZYW = 44° (but wait, in triangle YWV, the angle at Y would be between W and V, which might be ∠ZYW if Z is on the line VY. Let me clarify.

Since points V, Z, Y are colinear, with Z between V and Y, then at point Y, the angle between Z and W is ∠ZYW = 44°. So, if we consider triangle YWV, the angle at Y is ∠WYV, which might include ∠ZYW.

Wait, if line YW is connected, then ∠WYV is the angle at Y between W and V. Since Z is on line VY, then ∠WYV is composed of ∠ZYW and ∠ZYZ? No, it's just ∠WYV, which is the same as ∠ZYW if W is on the other side. Wait, this is confusing without a diagram, but let's proceed.

Assuming that in triangle YWV, the angles are:

At V: ∠UVW = 121° (wait, no, ∠UVW is at V between U and W, which might not be the same as the angle at V in triangle YWV. Wait, if W is connected to V, then the angle at V in triangle YWV is ∠WVY, which might be the same as ∠UVW if U is on the line VW. But this requires more assumptions.

Let me try to consider triangle YWV. Its angles are at Y, W, V.

At V: let's call it ∠WVY. If this is the same as ∠UVW = 121°, then:

∠WVY = 121°

At W: ∠YWV = 52° (given)

At Y: let's call it ∠WYV.

Sum of angles in triangle YWV: 121 + 52 + ∠WYV = 180

→ ∠WYV = 180 - 173 = 7°

But we also have ∠ZYW = 44°, which is at Y between Z and W. If ∠WYV is 7°, and ∠ZYW is 44°, then these angles might be adjacent, forming a larger angle at Y.

If points Z, Y, V are colinear, and W is somewhere such that ∠ZYW and ∠WYV are adjacent, then:

∠ZYW + ∠WYV = ∠ZYV

But ∠ZYV is a straight line, so it should be 180°. Let's check:

44 + 7 = 51 ≠ 180. Not possible. So this suggests inconsistency.

But wait, maybe ∠WYV is not 7°. Where is the mistake?

Let me re-examine. If in triangle YWV, the angle at V is ∠WVY, which might not be the same as ∠UVW = 121°. Let me clarify.

∠UVW is the angle at V between U and W. If U is on the line VZ, and Z is on line VY, then the angle at V between U and W would depend on the position of W.

Assuming that W is not on line VZ, but somewhere else. This is too ambiguous.

But let's try to calculate ∠WYV. If we have triangle YWV with angles at W = 52°, at V = ?, and at Y = ?.

But without knowing the other angles, it's hard. However, we know ∠ZYW = 44°, which is at Y between Z and W. If this is part of ∠WYV, then:

∠WYV = ∠ZYW + something.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. However, let's assume that ∠WYV is composed of ∠ZYW and another angle. If ∠WYV is part of a straight line, then it might be 180°, but this is speculation.

Alternatively, let's consider that ∠WYV is the same as ∠ZYW. If so, then ∠WYV = 44°, and the sum of angles in triangle YWV would be 52 + 44 + ∠WVY = 180 → ∠WVY = 84°.

But ∠WVY is at V, which could be related to ∠UVW = 121°. If ∠UVW is part of ∠WVY, then 121° = ∠WVY + something, but this is uncertain.

Alternatively, if ∠UVW is the same as ∠WVY, then 121° = 84°, which is false.

This suggests inconsistencies, but since we derived x = 44 from the earlier condition, and it satisfies the supplementary angles at Z, it might be the correct value, and the inconsistencies in other parts might be due to my misassumptions about the diagram.

Let me proceed with x = 44 and see what ∠W is.

The question asks for m∠W. Which angle is ∠W? The given angles include ∠YWV = x + 8 = 44 + 8 = 52°, which is at W between Y and V. So, this is likely the angle we need, m∠W = 52°. But none of the answer choices are 52. The closest is C. 76 or D. 152, but neither matches.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in identifying which angle is ∠W. Let me check the original problem statement.

The question says: "Find m∠W." In geometric problems, ∠W typically refers to the angle at point W. The given angles include ∠YWV (at W), which is x + 8, and possibly others.

But if x = 44, then ∠YWV = 52°, which is not among the choices. But the answer choices are A. 38, B. 38, C. 76, D. 152. So this suggests that x = 44 is incorrect.

Wait, but where is the error? Let me recheck the earlier step where I assumed ∠UVW is the exterior angle.

I said that if W is on the extension of VZ, then ∠UVW is an exterior angle to triangle UVZ, hence:

∠UVW = ∠VUZ + ∠UZV

Which gave us:

3x - 11 = (x - 8) + ∠UZV

Then, ∠UZV = 2x - 3

Then, assuming ∠UZV and ∠UZY are supplementary, giving:

(2x - 3) + (2x + 7) = 180 → 4x + 4 = 180 → x = 44

This part seems correct.

But then, with x = 44, ∠YWV = x + 8 = 52°, which is not in the choices. But the answer choices are 38, 38, 76, 152. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the angle at W.

Wait, let me double-check the given angles. The problem lists:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(V, U, Z)), x-8) → ∠VUZ = x - 8
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(U, V, W)), 3x-11) → ∠UVW = 3x - 11
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y, W, V)), x+8) → ∠YWV = x + 8
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, W)), x) → ∠ZYW = x
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(U, Z, Y)), 2x+7) → ∠UZY = 2x + 7

So, ∠YWV is at W, between Y and V, which is ∠YWV. So, if this is the angle at W, then with x=44, it's 52°, but this is not an option. Hence, there must be a mistake.

Let me check if there's another angle at W. For example, maybe ∠UWZ or something else?

Wait, the problem asks for m∠W, which could be any angle at W, but likely the one mentioned in the options. Since ∠YWV is given as x+8, and it's at W, perhaps there's another angle at W that is the actual ∠W.

Wait, maybe the question refers to ∠UWV, which is the angle at W between U and V, which is the same as ∠YWV if Y is on the line UV. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe ∠W is referring to a different angle. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for ∠UWV, which is the angle at W between U and V. If this is the case, then in triangle UVW, the angle at W is ∠UWV, which we previously calculated as ∠UWV = 18 - 2x (from earlier incorrect assumption), but with x=44, that would be 18 - 88 = -70, which is invalid.

Wait, let me go back to when I assumed the exterior angle at V. With x=44, ∠UVW = 121°, and if ∠UWV is part of another triangle.

Let me consider triangle UVW. Its angles are at U, V, W.

We have ∠UVW = 121°, and if we can find the other angles.

If ∠VUZ = 36° is part of this triangle, but how?

If ∠VUZ is at U, then it would be one of the angles of triangle UVW. Let's assume that ∠VUZ is the angle at U in triangle UVW. Then, the sum of angles would be:

∠VUZ + ∠UVW + ∠UWV = 180

So:

36 + 121 + ∠UWV = 180 → ∠UWV = 23°

Now, ∠UWV is the angle at W in triangle UVW, which is ∠UWV. If this is the angle at W, then m∠W = 23°, which is not in the choices either.

But this contradicts the earlier calculation of ∠YWV = 52°. So, this suggests that there are multiple angles at W, and the question is asking for a specific one.

But the problem states "Find m∠W," and in most cases, this would refer to the angle at W in the context of the diagram. Since ∠YWV is given as x + 8, and if x=44, it's 52°, which is not an option, but perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for x. When I assumed ∠UZV + ∠UZY = 180°, I got x=44. Let me verify this again.

∠UZV = 2x - 3

∠UZY = 2x + 7

Their sum: 2x - 3 + 2x + 7 = 4x + 4 = 180 → 4x = 176 → x = 44. Correct.

So x=44 is correct. Then, ∠YWV = x + 8 = 52°. But this is not in the choices. However, let me check if there's another angle at W that is the desired one.

Let me consider the angle at W between Z and Y, which is ∠ZWY, but this is not given. Or maybe ∠UWZ?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to ∠UWV, which is 23°, or ∠YWV = 52°, or another angle.

But since 52 is not in the options, perhaps there's an error in the assumption that ∠UZV + ∠UZY = 180°. Maybe they are not supplementary, but something else.

Let me reconsider this. If points V, Z, Y are colinear, then ∠UZV and ∠UZY are on opposite sides of line VZ, so they might not be supplementary. Instead, they might form a vertical angle or something else.

Wait, if V, Z, Y are colinear, then line VZ is extended to Y. At point Z, the angle ∠UZV is between U and V, and ∠UZY is between U and Y. So, if line VZ is extended to Y, then ∠UZV and ∠UZY are adjacent angles at Z, forming a straight line, hence supplementary. So, their sum should be 180°, which is what I assumed. So this part is correct.

Thus, x=44 is correct, leading to ∠YWV = 52°, but this is not in the choices. This suggests either a mistake in the problem, or a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check if there's another angle at W. Let me consider the angle at W between Z and Y, which is ∠ZWY. If this is part of a triangle with other angles.

Alternatively, let me consider triangle ZYW, which has angles at Z, Y, W. We have ∠ZYW = x = 44°, and ∠UZY = 95° (at Z). Wait, no, ∠UZY is at Z between U and Y. If Z is on line VY, then ∠UZY is part of triangle UZY, and ∠UZV is part of triangle UZV.

But in triangle ZYW, the angle at Z is ∠YZW, which is supplementary to ∠UZY, so ∠YZW = 180 - 95 = 85°.

Thus, in triangle ZYW, angles are:

At Z: 85°

At Y: 44°

At W: let's call it γ

So, 85 + 44 + γ = 180 → γ = 51°

So, ∠YWZ = 51°, which is the angle at W in triangle ZYW.

Now, this angle at W, ∠YWZ = 51°, might be the ∠W we need. But 51 is still not in the choices. Closest is 76 or 52, but not matching.

Wait, but let me check if this angle ∠YWZ is the same as ∠YWV = 52°. If they are supplementary, then 51 + 52 = 103, not 180. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if ∠YWZ is part of another triangle.

Let me consider triangle YWV. If ∠YWV = 52°, and ∠YWZ = 51°, then if these are adjacent, their sum would be 103°, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, if ∠YWZ is part of a straight line with ∠YWV, then 51 + 52 = 103, not 180.

This is perplexing. Given that x=44 is the only consistent solution, and it leads to ∠YWV = 52°, which is not in the choices, but the closest is C. 76 or D. 152, perhaps there's a calculation error.

Wait, let me recheck all calculations with x=44.

∠VUZ = x - 8 = 44 - 8 = 36°

∠UVW = 3x - 11 = 132 - 11 = 121°

∠UZV = 2x - 3 = 88 - 3 = 85°

∠UZY = 2x + 7 = 88 + 7 = 95°

∠ZYW = x = 44°

∠YWV = x + 8 = 52°

In triangle ZYW, angles are 85° at Z, 44° at Y, and 51° at W.

Now, let's look at triangle YWV. It has angles at Y: ∠ZYW = 44°, at W: ∠YWV = 52°, and at V: let's call it δ.

So, 44 + 52 + δ = 180 → δ = 84°

Now, δ is the angle at V in triangle YWV, which is ∠WVY = 84°.

Now, this angle ∠WVY = 84°
