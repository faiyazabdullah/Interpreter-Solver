MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this geometry problem. So, we have several angles given with certain measures and relationships between them. The goal is to find the measure of angle 1, which is denoted as ∠BED (since it's Angle(B, E, D)). Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given information.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E. Also, point E lies on both line AD and line CB. That means lines AD and CB intersect at point E. Wait, but maybe I need to sketch this mentally. Let me note down the key points:

- Point E is on line AD and also on line CB. So, lines AD and CB meet at E. Therefore, E is the intersection point of AD and CB. So, quadrilateral ABCD? Or maybe triangle? Hmm, not sure yet. But there are points A, B, C, D connected through these lines.

Also, angles given:

- Measure of angle D-E-C equals angle 2. So that's ∠DEC = angle 2.
- Measure of angle D-A-C equals angle 3. So ∠DAC = angle 3.
- Measure of angle D-B-C is 35 degrees. So ∠DBC = 35°?
Wait, wait. Wait, angle D-B-C would be ∠DBC? Wait, angle notation: Angle(D, B, C) is the angle at point B between points D and C. Wait no, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(D, B, C) would be the angle at point B formed by points D, B, C. So ∠DBC. Similarly, Angle(D, E, C) is the angle at E between D and C, so ∠DEC. Similarly, Angle(D, A, C) is angle at A between D and C, so ∠DAC. Then Angle(A, C, E) is angle at C between A and E, so ∠ACE. And Angle(B, E, D) is angle at E between B and D, which is ∠BED, which is angle 1. And Angle(E, D, B) is angle at D between E and B, so ∠EDB, which is given as 75°.

So let me list all the given angles and their measures:

Given:

1. ∠DEC = angle 2
2. ∠DAC = angle 3
3. ∠DBC = 35°
4. ∠ACE = 28°
5. ∠BED = angle 1
6. ∠EDB = 75°

Additionally, E lies on AD and CB. So lines AD and CB intersect at E. So, perhaps triangles involved here?

Let me try to imagine or draw this. Points A, D connected via line AD; points C, B connected via line CB; they intersect at E. So, E is inside some figure. Maybe triangle ABC with points D somewhere? Not sure yet.

But since E is on AD and CB, then BE is part of line CB, and DE is part of line AD.

Now, looking at angles around point E. Since E is the intersection of AD and CB, then lines AD and CB cross at E. So, vertical angles at E would be equal. For example, ∠AEB and ∠CED are vertical angles. Also, ∠DEB and ∠AEC are vertical angles. Wait, but the given angles include ∠BED (which is angle 1), and ∠EDB is 75°, which is at D.

So, considering triangle EDB: In triangle EDB, we know angle at D (∠EDB) is 75°, angle at E is ∠BED (which is angle 1), and angle at B is ∠EBD. Wait, but ∠EBD is part of ∠DBC, which was given as 35°. Wait, because ∠DBC is 35°, which is the angle at B between D and C. But since E is on CB, then ∠EBD is part of ∠DBC. So, ∠EBD is the same as ∠DBC? Wait, if E is on CB, then BD is part of BC? Wait, no. If E is on CB, then point E is somewhere along CB. So, BD is a segment from B to D. Wait, but D is another point. So, perhaps triangle EBD has vertices at E, B, D.

In triangle EBD, angles are:

At D: ∠EDB = 75°, given.

At E: ∠BED = angle 1, which we need to find.

At B: ∠EBD. What's the measure of that?

Since E is on CB, then ∠EBD is part of ∠DBC, which is given as 35°. Wait, but ∠DBC is the angle at B between D and C. So, if E is on CB, then ∠EBD is the same as ∠DBC? Wait, no. Because if you look at point B, with points D and C, then ∠DBC is the angle between BD and BC. However, since E is on BC, then BE is part of BC. Therefore, ∠EBD is the angle between BE and BD. Wait, but BE is along BC. So ∠EBD is the same as ∠DBC? Wait, yes! Because if you consider point E lying on BC, then BE is a segment of BC. Therefore, the angle between BD and BE (which is part of BC) is the same as angle between BD and BC, which is ∠DBC. Therefore, ∠EBD = ∠DBC = 35°. 

Therefore, in triangle EBD, the three angles are:

∠EDB = 75°, ∠EBD = 35°, and ∠BED = angle 1. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:

75 + 35 + angle1 = 180 => angle1 = 180 - 75 - 35 = 70°. So angle1 is 70°, which would correspond to option B.

Wait, but hold on. Is there any possibility that I made a mistake here? Let me check again.

Because if ∠EBD is indeed 35°, then yes, adding up to 75+35=110, so angle1 is 70. But let me make sure that ∠EBD is actually 35°. 

The problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)) is 35°, which is ∠DBC. Since E lies on line CB, then BE is a part of CB. So, when you look at ∠EBD, it's the angle between EB and BD. Since EB is along CB, then ∠EBD is the same as ∠DBC, which is given as 35°. So that seems right.

Therefore, in triangle EBD, angles are 75°, 35°, and angle1. Summing to 180 gives angle1=70°. Hence, answer B.

But wait, let me check if there are other constraints or if there's something else. Are there other angles given that might affect this?

Other given angles are:

MeasureOf(Angle(D, E, C)) = angle2. Which is ∠DEC = angle2.

MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)) = angle3. Which is ∠DAC = angle3.

MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, E)) = 28°, which is ∠ACE = 28°.

So, maybe there are more relations here. Perhaps triangle ADC or other triangles?

Alternatively, maybe there are other triangles where these angles come into play. But for angle1, which is ∠BED, the calculation above seems straightforward. However, maybe there's a catch here.

Wait, could there be other angles affecting this? For instance, maybe angle DEC relates to other parts?

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved? But the problem didn't mention any such thing. So unless there's something missing here.

Alternatively, maybe my assumption about triangle EBD is incorrect? Let me think again.

Points E is on AD and CB. So, lines AD and CB intersect at E. Therefore, E is inside the figure. Let's consider triangle CBD? Or triangle EBD?

If we focus on triangle EBD, as before, with points E, B, D. We have ∠EDB = 75°, ∠EBD = 35°, and ∠BED = angle1. So, that should give us angle1 = 70°, so answer B. But let me check if there are other constraints that might require this angle to be different.

Another way: suppose we consider other angles. For example, ∠ACE = 28°, which is angle at C between A and E. So, in triangle ACE, perhaps? Also, ∠DAC = angle3. So, ∠DAC is the angle at A between D and C. So, in triangle DAC, angle at A is angle3.

But how does this relate to angle1?

Alternatively, maybe there are some cyclic quadrilaterals or something else? But without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to say. However, the problem only asks for angle1, which is in triangle EBD, and according to the given data, that triangle's angles can be determined directly. Unless there's some error in assuming that ∠EBD is 35°.

Wait, let me re-examine ∠DBC. It's given as 35°, which is angle at B between D and C. Now, since E is on CB, then BE is part of CB. So, the angle between BD and BE (i.e., ∠EBD) is the same as ∠DBC? Yes, because BE is just a segment extending from B towards C, so the direction from B to E is the same as from B to C. Thus, the angle between BD and BE is the same as between BD and BC, which is ∠DBC = 35°. Therefore, ∠EBD is indeed 35°, making the calculation valid.

Thus, angle1 is 70°, so answer B. But let me check the answer choices again. Option B is 70. So that would be the answer. However, sometimes problems may have tricks, like considering exterior angles or other configurations. Let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a larger triangle involving angle1? For example, maybe considering triangle AED or others. But angle1 is specifically ∠BED, which is in triangle EBD. Given that, and the given angles in that triangle, I don't see any contradictions. 

Another thought: Could there be an error in assuming that E is inside the triangle or outside? For example, if E were outside, then the angles might differ. But since E is on AD and CB, depending on the positions, but since ∠EDB is given as 75°, which is quite large, implying that E is positioned such that D is not too close to B. But regardless, the triangle EBD exists with those angles. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 70°, so option B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 1 $, which corresponds to $ \angle BED $, we examine triangle $ \triangle EBD $. This triangle is defined by the points $ E $, $ B $, and $ D $, where:

- $ \angle EDB = 75^\circ $ (given),
- $ \angle EBD = \angle DBC = 35^\circ $ (given and confirmed by the fact that $ E $ lies on line $ CB $, hence $ \angle EBD $ aligns with $ \angle DBC $).

We apply the **Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**, which states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always $ 180^\circ $. Therefore:

$$
\angle EDB + \angle EBD + \angle BED = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
75^\circ + 35^\circ + \angle BED = 180^\circ
$$

$$
\angle BED = 180^\circ - 75^\circ - 35^\circ = 70^\circ
$$
