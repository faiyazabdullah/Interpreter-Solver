Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me try to sketch it mentally.

We have several points mentioned: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. There are lines connecting these points with specific conditions. Also, there are angles labeled 1 through 8, which relate to various angle measures. The key equations given are that certain angles are equal to each other, and some lines are parallel or intersecting at specific points.

First, let me note down all the constraints:

1. ∠C H E = ∠5
2. ∠A C B = ∠2
3. ∠F C A = ∠1
4. ∠D H C = ∠7
5. ∠G C F = ∠3 (This is important since we're given m∠3 = x - 12)
6. ∠B C G = ∠4
7. ∠B H D = ∠8
8. ∠E H B = ∠6 (Given m∠6 = 72)

Also, point C lies on line AG. So, points A, C, G are colinear. Similarly, H lies on line CB, meaning H is somewhere on CB. Then, C also lies on line BF, so points B, C, F are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B, F)) means that point C is on line BF. Wait, but earlier, H is on line CB. Hmm. Also, H is on line DF? No, wait: PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(D, E)). Wait, no. Let me check again:

The constraints are:

- PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A, G)): So C is on AG.
- PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(C, B)): So H is on CB.
- PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B, F)): So C is on BF. Therefore, points B, C, F are colinear.
- PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(B, F)): So H is on BF as well. Since H is on both CB and BF, then H must be the intersection point of CB and BF. But since C is on BF, then H is on CB and BF, implying that H is the same as C? Or maybe not? Wait, if H is on CB and on BF, then H could be a different point. Let me think. If C is on BF, then BF is a line passing through C. So H is on CB (which is part of BF) and also on BF. Therefore, H is a point on BF such that it's also on CB. That would mean H is between B and C, or beyond C?

Wait, perhaps H is a point on CB extended? Not sure yet. Also, there's another constraint: PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(F, H)). So C is on line FH. And PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(D, E)). So H is on DE. Also, Parallel(Line(A, C), Line(H, E)). So AC is parallel to HE.

Let me try to draw this step by step.

Starting with line AC. Since C is on AG and BF. Let me imagine points A, C, G colinear. Points B, C, F colinear. So AC is connected to AG, and BF passes through C. Then H is on CB and BF. So H is on CB (so between B and C?), and also on BF. Wait, but BF already contains C. So if H is on CB (which is part of BF), then H is on BF. Therefore, H is a point along BF. Additionally, H is on DE. Also, HE is parallel to AC.

So, HE || AC. Since AC is a line from A to C. HE is a line from H to E. Given that HE is parallel to AC, so their slopes are equal if we consider coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Alternatively, using properties of parallel lines and transversals.

But first, let's look for angle relationships. The problem gives us that m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72°. We need to find x. So, likely, we need to express x in terms of known angles, possibly using triangle properties, parallel lines, etc.

Let me note that ∠3 is ∠GCF. From the given constraints, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, C, A)), MeasureOf(angle 1)). So ∠FCA = ∠1. Which is angle at C between F and A. So ∠FCA is angle at C, between F and A. Which is the same as ∠ACF. Wait, since C is on BF and AG. So, line CF is part of BF, and CA is part of AG. So ∠ACF is the angle at C between A and F. Which is ∠ACF. Since AC is connected to AG and CF is connected to BF. So that angle is formed at point C between lines CA and CF. So ∠ACF = ∠1.

Similarly, ∠GCF is angle at C between G and F. Since point G is on line AC (since C is on AG). So line CG is part of AG. Therefore, ∠GCF is the angle at C between GC and FC. Since GC is part of AG, and FC is part of BF. Therefore, ∠GCF is adjacent to ∠ACF? Because ∠ACF + ∠GCF would make up a straight line if they are supplementary? Wait, depending on how the lines are arranged.

Wait, since points A, C, G are colinear, then line AG passes through C. So line CA is going from C to A, and line CG goes from C to G. But since A, C, G are colinear, then line CA is opposite to CG. Wait, if you go from A to C to G, then line AG is straight. So ∠GCF is the angle between GC (which is the extension of CA beyond C) and CF. Wait, because C is on BF, so CF is part of BF. So, ∠GCF is formed by GC (which is in the direction from C to G, i.e., away from A) and CF (from C to F).

Therefore, ∠GCF is adjacent to ∠ACF. So ∠ACF + ∠GCF = 180°, since they form a linear pair along line AG and BF. Wait, unless they are vertical angles or something else. Wait, let me clarify.

Since line AG includes points A-C-G. So at point C, line AG splits into two directions: towards A and towards G. Line CF is another line starting at C and going towards F. So ∠ACF is between CA and CF, while ∠GCF is between GC and CF. Since CA and GC are in a straight line (AG), then ∠ACF + ∠GCF = 180°, because they are adjacent angles forming a straight line when combined. Therefore, ∠ACF + ∠GCF = 180°. 

From the given constraints, ∠ACF = ∠1, and ∠GCF = ∠3. Therefore, ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. So ∠1 = 180° - ∠3. 

Now, moving on. Let's see if we can find relations involving ∠6. ∠6 is ∠EHB. The given measure is 72°, so m∠6 = 72°. Let's see how ∠6 relates to other angles.

Looking back at the constraints, there's a parallel line condition: Line AC || Line HE. Since HE is parallel to AC, then corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc., may come into play.

Additionally, H is on line DE. Also, H is on line CB and BF. Let me try to consider triangle or other figures that involve these lines.

Let me think about triangle EHB. ∠EHB is ∠6, which is given as 72°. Also, since HE || AC, and if there's a transversal cutting them, then certain angles might be congruent.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle CHB or something similar.

Wait, since HE || AC, and suppose there's a transversal that intersects these lines. For example, line HB. Let's see: If HE || AC, and line HB is a transversal, then the angle between HE and HB would be equal to the angle between AC and HB. However, without knowing where point E is located, it's hard to say. But perhaps there's more information.

Also, H is on line DE. So line DE connects D to E, and H is a point on DE. Also, H is on line CB (and BF). So points D, H, E are colinear, with H being on CB and BF.

Hmm. This seems complex. Maybe I should assign variables to unknown angles and set up equations.

Let me list all the angle equalities again:

1. ∠CHE = ∠5
2. ∠ACB = ∠2
3. ∠FCA = ∠1
4. ∠DHC = ∠7
5. ∠GCF = ∠3 (given m∠3 = x -12)
6. ∠BCG = ∠4
7. ∠BHD = ∠8
8. ∠EHB = ∠6 (given as 72°)

Also, the parallel lines: AC || HE.

Perhaps focusing on triangle relationships or using the fact that lines are parallel.

Let me start with the parallel lines AC || HE. Let me think about the angles created by transversals.

Suppose we take line HE and line AC, which are parallel. Let's consider a transversal that crosses both. For instance, line HB. Let me assume that line HB is a transversal crossing HE and AC. Then, the corresponding angles would be equal.

But where does line HB cross AC? Well, point H is on line CB, which is part of BF. Also, line AC is connected to point C. Let me think: If we consider line HB, which starts at H (on CB) and extends to B. Since AC is parallel to HE, and if line HB intersects AC at some point... Wait, line HB starts at H and goes to B. Is there a point where HB intersects AC? Not necessarily unless extended. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle CHE. Since HE || AC, and maybe there's a relationship between angles in that triangle.

Alternatively, since HE || AC, and H is on CB, which is connected to B. Let me try to consider angles around point H.

At point H, there are multiple lines: HE, HC (since H is on CB), HD (since H is on DE). So angles at H include ∠EHB (∠6), ∠DHC (∠7), and others.

Given that HE || AC, and line HC is part of line CB. So line HC is a transversal cutting HE and AC. Therefore, the angle between HE and HC should be equal to the angle between AC and HC. Since HE || AC, and HC is a transversal.

So, the angle between HE and HC (∠EHC) is equal to the angle between AC and HC. Let's denote ∠EHC = ∠HCB (since HC is part of CB). Wait, ∠HCB is the angle at C between HC and CB. Wait, but HC is part of CB, so ∠HCB would be zero? No, that's not right. Wait, point H is on CB. So line HC is just a segment of CB. Therefore, the angle between HE and HC (at point H) is ∠EHC, which corresponds to the angle between HE and CB. Since HE || AC, then ∠EHC equals the angle between AC and CB. 

Because HE || AC, and CB is a transversal. So ∠EHC = ∠ACB. Because ∠ACB is the angle between AC and CB. Therefore, ∠EHC = ∠ACB. But ∠ACB is ∠2, according to the given constraints. So ∠EHC = ∠2. 

But ∠EHC is part of triangle EHC. Also, from the given constraints, ∠CHE = ∠5. Wait, ∠CHE is the angle at H between C and E. Wait, ∠CHE is ∠EHC? Wait, notation: Angle(C, H, E) is the angle at H between points C, H, E. So it's ∠EHC. Therefore, ∠CHE = ∠EHC = ∠5. Earlier, we said that ∠EHC = ∠ACB = ∠2. Therefore, ∠5 = ∠2. So ∠5 = ∠2.

That's one relationship.

Moving on. Now, looking at other angles. Let's consider ∠BHD = ∠8. Since H is on DE, BD? Wait, point D is on line DE? Wait, H is on DE. So line DE has points D, H, E. Therefore, ∠BHD is the angle at H between B and D. So, ∠BHD is formed by lines HB and HD. Since H is on DE, HD is part of line DE. So, ∠BHD is the angle between HB and HD.

Not sure yet. Let me think about other relations.

Earlier, we had ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, because ∠ACF (∠1) and ∠GCF (∠3) form a linear pair. So ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. 

Another relation: At point C, there are multiple lines. Let's consider angles around point C. For example, ∠ACB = ∠2 (given), ∠ACF = ∠1, ∠BCG = ∠4, and ∠GCF = ∠3. Wait, since C is on BF and AG, and lines from C to various points.

Wait, let's consider the angles at point C. The lines coming out of C are:

- CA (to A)
- CB (to B)
- CF (to F)
- CG (to G)
- CH (but H is on CB, so CH is part of CB?)

Wait, H is on CB, so line CH is the same as line CB. So at point C, the lines are CA, CB, CF, CG. So the angles around point C include:

Between CA and CB: ∠ACB = ∠2.

Between CA and CF: ∠ACF = ∠1.

Between CF and CB: Since CF is part of BF, and CB is part of CB, so that's ∠FCB. Wait, but ∠FCB is the same as ∠BCF. Depending on the configuration.

Wait, since points B, C, F are colinear, then line BF passes through C. Therefore, ∠FCB is a straight line, so it's 180 degrees. Wait, no. If you have points B, C, F on a straight line, then ∠FCB is actually a straight angle, so 180°, but that's only if you consider the angle between CB and CF. Wait, but ∠FCB would be the angle at C between F and B, which is a straight line. So that angle is 180°, which suggests that ∠FCB is 180°, but that might not be helpful.

However, we also have other angles at point C. For example, ∠BCG = ∠4. Since G is on line AG, and C is on AG. So line CG is part of AG. Therefore, ∠BCG is the angle at C between B and G. Which is the angle between CB and CG. Since CG is part of AG, and CB is part of BF. So ∠BCG is the angle between CB and CG.

Similarly, ∠GCF is the angle between GC and CF, which we've considered earlier as ∠3.

So, combining these, the sum of angles around point C related to lines CB, CG, and CF would be:

∠BCG (∠4) + ∠GCF (∠3) + ... ?

Wait, if we consider the line CB and CG. Since CG is part of AG, which is a separate line from BF. So the angle between CB and CG is ∠BCG = ∠4. Then, from point C, the line CF is part of BF. So from CG to CF, the angle between CG and CF is ∠GCF = ∠3. Therefore, ∠BCG + ∠GCF = ∠BCF. But ∠BCF is the angle between BC and CF, which is a straight line (since B, C, F are colinear), so that angle is 180°. Hence:

∠4 + ∠3 = 180°. Therefore, ∠4 + ∠3 = 180°.

Wait, that's interesting. So ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°. 

Previously, we had ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. Therefore, ∠1 = ∠4. 

So, ∠1 = ∠4. 

Now, let's look for other relations. Let's consider the angles at point H. 

We know that ∠EHB = ∠6 = 72°. Also, since HE || AC, and line HB is a transversal, then the angle between HE and HB (∠EHB) is equal to the angle between AC and HB. 

Wait, ∠EHB is at point H, between E and B. So, the angle between HE and HB is ∠EHB = 72°. Since HE || AC, then the corresponding angle with respect to AC would be the angle between AC and HB. 

So, if we consider line HB and line AC, which are cut by a transversal. Wait, but HB is a line starting at H, which is on CB and DE. How does HB relate to AC?

Alternatively, since HE || AC, then the angle between HE and HB is equal to the angle between AC and HB. Let me denote that angle as θ. So, ∠EHB = θ = ∠6 = 72°, which equals the angle between AC and HB. 

Let me think about where HB meets AC. If we extend HB until it meets AC, but since H is on CB, and AC is connected to C, maybe HB meets AC at point C? Wait, H is on CB, so line HB is part of CB. Wait, if H is on CB, then line HB is the same as line CB. Therefore, the angle between AC and HB would be the angle between AC and CB at point C. 

Wait, that makes sense! Because HB is part of line CB. Therefore, the angle between AC and HB is the angle between AC and CB, which is ∠ACB = ∠2. 

Therefore, ∠EHB = ∠ACB → ∠6 = ∠2. So, ∠6 = ∠2. Given that ∠6 = 72°, so ∠2 = 72°. 

So now we have ∠2 = 72°, and earlier we had ∠5 = ∠2, so ∠5 = 72°. 

Also, from before, ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, so ∠1 = ∠4. 

Let me note down:

∠2 = 72°
∠5 = 72°
∠6 = 72°
∠1 = ∠4

Now, let's look for other angles. 

Let me consider triangle BCG. In this triangle, we have ∠BCG = ∠4. Also, since C is on BF, and G is on AG. So triangle BCG has vertices at B, C, G. What other angles do we know about this triangle?

Well, the sum of angles in triangle BCG is 180°. So ∠BCG + ∠CBG + ∠BGC = 180°. 

But I don't know ∠CBG or ∠BGC yet. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle CHE. Earlier, we saw that ∠CHE = ∠5 = 72°. Also, since HE || AC, and assuming some transversal...

Wait, let me think about line DE. H is on DE, so line DE passes through H. Also, line HE is part of line HE, which is parallel to AC. 

If we consider triangle DHE or something else. Alternatively, since H is on DE and on CB, and HE || AC, perhaps there are similar triangles or something.

Alternatively, considering that HE || AC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, if we have a transversal DH intersecting HE and AC. Wait, but I need to define where D is. 

Wait, H is on DE. So line DE connects D to E, with H lying somewhere on it. So, line DE is connected to E, which is connected to H via HE. Since HE || AC, and maybe there's a way to relate angles at E.

Alternatively, since HE || AC, then ∠HEC is equal to ∠ACB, because they are corresponding angles. Wait, let me verify.

Imagine line HE || AC, and a transversal EC. So, ∠HEC and ∠ECB would be corresponding angles. Wait, if EC is a transversal, then yes. So ∠HEC = ∠ECB. But ∠ECB is the same as ∠2, which is 72°, because ∠ECB is the angle at C between E and B. Wait, but E isn't directly connected to C yet. Wait, unless there's a connection between E and C. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠HEC is equal to ∠ACB. Let me think again. 

If HE || AC, then the angle between HE and EC is equal to the angle between AC and EC. So ∠HEC = ∠ACE. 

But ∠ACE is the angle at C between A and E. However, I'm not sure about the position of E. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since HE || AC, and if there's a triangle involving E and C, maybe. 

Let me try to focus on the angles we know. 

We have ∠6 = 72°, which is ∠EHB. Also, ∠EHB is part of triangle EHB. If I can find other angles in that triangle, maybe I can use the sum of angles to find something.

In triangle EHB, angles are ∠EHB = 72°, ∠HBE, and ∠BEH. But I don't know those yet. 

Alternatively, since H is on DE, and HE || AC, perhaps there's a relationship between angles involving E. 

Alternatively, looking back at ∠DHC = ∠7. Since H is on DE and on CB, and ∠DHC is the angle at H between D and C. So, ∠DHC is formed by lines HD and HC. Since HC is part of CB, and HD is part of DE. 

Maybe considering triangle DHC. In this triangle, ∠DHC = ∠7. If we can find other angles in this triangle, we might relate them. 

But without more info, this seems difficult. Let me recap what I have:

Known angles:

- ∠2 = ∠6 = 72°
- ∠5 = ∠2 = 72°
- ∠1 = ∠4
- ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°
- ∠3 + ∠4 = 180° ⇒ ∠1 = ∠4

So, from ∠1 + ∠3 = 180° and ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, substituting ∠4 = ∠1 into the second equation gives ∠3 + ∠1 = 180°, which matches the first equation. So no new info here.

Now, what about other angles? Let's think about line DE and H being on it. Also, HE || AC. 

Since HE || AC, then the slope of HE equals the slope of AC. Suppose we assign coordinates to simplify. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Since AC is parallel to HE. Let me assume AC is horizontal for ease. So AC is horizontal. Thus, HE is also horizontal. 

Let me define coordinates:

Let’s set point C at (0, 0). Let’s assume line AC is horizontal, so point A is to the left of C, say at (-a, 0), and point G is to the right of C, at (b, 0), making line AG pass through C. 

Since HE is parallel to AC (horizontal), then HE must be horizontal. So point H and E have the same y-coordinate. 

Point H is on line CB and BF. Let me assume line CB is some line. Since C is at (0,0), and B is another point. Let me choose coordinates for B. Let me assume B is at (0, c) vertically above C, making CB vertical. Then line CB is vertical. Wait, but earlier we had that HE is horizontal. If CB is vertical, then H is on CB, so its coordinates would be (0, h) for some h. Then line HE is horizontal, so E must be horizontally aligned with H. So if H is at (0, h), then E is at (k, h) for some k.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe assigning specific values would help. Let me try.

Let me fix coordinates:

Let me set point C at (0, 0). Let me take AC horizontal. Let me set A at (-1, 0), so that AC is from A(-1,0) to C(0,0). Then line AG continues past C to G. Let me pick G at (1, 0), so AG is from A(-1,0) through C(0,0) to G(1,0). 

Now, line BF passes through C(0,0). Let me define point B somewhere. Let me choose B at (0, b) to make CB vertical. Then line BF goes through B(0,b) and C(0,0). So line BF is the vertical line x=0. Therefore, point F is on this line. Let me choose F at (0, f), but since C is already on BF, maybe F is another point. Let's say F is at (0, -1), so that BF is from B(0,b) through C(0,0) to F(0,-1).

Now, point H is on line CB and BF. Since CB is vertical line x=0 from B(0,b) to C(0,0), and BF is the same line. So H is somewhere on this vertical line. Let me choose H at (0, h), where h is between 0 and b or below. 

Also, H is on line DE. So line DE passes through H(0,h). Let me determine coordinates for D and E such that H is on DE. Let me assume E is at (e_x, e_y), and D is some other point. Since HE is horizontal (because AC is horizontal and HE || AC), then since H is at (0, h), E must be at (k, h) for some k. Therefore, line DE connects D to E(k, h), passing through H(0, h). So H is the midpoint or some point along DE. 

For simplicity, let me choose E at (1, h), so that HE is horizontal from H(0,h) to E(1,h). Then line DE connects D to E(1,h) and passes through H(0,h). So D must be on the line extending from E through H. For example, if I take D at (-1, h), then line DE would be from D(-1,h) to E(1,h), passing through H(0,h). 

So, with these coordinates:

- C: (0, 0)
- A: (-1, 0)
- G: (1, 0)
- B: (0, b)
- F: (0, -1)
- H: (0, h)
- E: (1, h)
- D: (-1, h)

Now, with this setup, HE is the line from H(0,h) to E(1,h), which is horizontal, matching AC's direction. 

Now, let's compute angles based on these coordinates.

First, let's calculate ∠6, which is ∠EHB. 

Points E(1,h), H(0,h), B(0,b). So angle at H between E and B. 

Vector HE is from H to E: (1 - 0, h - h) = (1, 0)
Vector HB is from H to B: (0 - 0, b - h) = (0, b - h)

The angle between vectors HE (right) and HB (upwards). The measure of ∠EHB is the angle between these two vectors. 

Using coordinates, the angle can be calculated via dot product:

cos(theta) = (HE • HB) / (|HE| |HB|)

HE • HB = (1)(0) + (0)(b - h) = 0. Wait, the dot product is zero? That implies that the vectors are perpendicular. So ∠EHB is 90°? But we were told that ∠6 = 72°. Contradiction? Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, why did I get a contradiction? Because I assumed E at (1,h), but maybe my assumption of E's location is wrong. Let me check.

Wait, HE is supposed to be parallel to AC, which is horizontal. So HE is horizontal, hence E must be horizontally aligned with H. So if H is at (0,h), then E must be at (x, h) for some x. But in my previous setup, I chose E at (1,h), but that led to ∠EHB being 90°, conflicting with the given ∠6 = 72°. So my assumption of E's position might be incorrect.

Let me instead allow E to be at some arbitrary (k, h), and find the angle ∠EHB. 

With H at (0,h), B at (0,b), E at (k, h). Then vector HE is (k - 0, h - h) = (k, 0). Vector HB is (0 - 0, b - h) = (0, b - h). 

Then the angle between HE (along x-axis) and HB (vertical) is 90°, regardless of k. So this suggests that ∠EHB is always 90°, which contradicts the given ∠6 = 72°. So my coordinate setup is flawed. 

Where is the error? 

Ah! I assumed that HE is horizontal, but in reality, HE is parallel to AC. AC is horizontal, so HE must be horizontal. However, in this setup, HE is horizontal, but the angle ∠EHB comes out as 90°, which conflicts with ∠6 = 72°. This suggests that my coordinate assumptions are conflicting with the problem's conditions. Perhaps my choice of placing B vertically is causing this issue. 

Alternative approach: Let me not assume CB is vertical. Instead, let me let AC be horizontal, and HE be horizontal, but CB is not vertical. Let me redefine coordinates.

Let me keep C at (0, 0), A at (-1, 0), G at (1, 0). Let me choose line BF such that it is not vertical. Let me define point B at (p, q), and since C is on BF, then line BF passes through B(p,q) and C(0,0). Let me choose specific coordinates for simplicity. Let me take B at (1, 1), so line BF goes from B(1,1) through C(0,0) to F. Let me choose F at (-1, -1) for symmetry. So line BF is the line from (1,1) to (0,0) to (-1,-1). 

Now, point H is on line BF and CB. Since CB is part of BF, H is somewhere on BF. Let me parametrize BF. Parametric equations for BF: from B(1,1) to C(0,0) to F(-1,-1). Let me choose H at some point on BF. Let me choose H at (t, t), where t ranges from 0 to 1 (for between B and C) or negative values beyond C. Let me choose H at (0.5, 0.5), halfway between B(1,1) and C(0,0). 

Now, since H is on line DE. So line DE passes through H(0.5, 0.5). Let me choose D and E such that DE passes through H and HE is parallel to AC (horizontal). 

Since HE is parallel to AC (horizontal), then HE must be horizontal. So E must have the same y-coordinate as H. H is at (0.5, 0.5), so E is at (e_x, 0.5). Let me choose E at (1, 0.5), so that HE is from H(0.5, 0.5) to E(1, 0.5), which is horizontal. Then line DE passes through H(0.5, 0.5) and E(1, 0.5). To define D, let me choose D at (0, 0.5), so that line DE goes from D(0, 0.5) to E(1, 0.5), passing through H(0.5, 0.5). 

Now, with this setup, let's calculate ∠EHB. 

Points E(1, 0.5), H(0.5, 0.5), B(1, 1). 

So angle at H between E and B. 

Vectors HE and HB:

HE: from H(0.5, 0.5) to E(1, 0.5): (1 - 0.5, 0.5 - 0.5) = (0.5, 0)
HB: from H(0.5, 0.5) to B(1, 1): (1 - 0.5, 1 - 0.5) = (0.5, 0.5)

Now, the angle between HE (vector (0.5, 0)) and HB (vector (0.5, 0.5)). 

Calculate the angle between these vectors:

Dot product: (0.5)(0.5) + (0)(0.5) = 0.25

Magnitude of HE: sqrt(0.5² + 0²) = 0.5

Magnitude of HB: sqrt(0.5² + 0.5²) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.7071

cos(theta) = 0.25 / (0.5 * 0.7071) ≈ 0.25 / 0.3536 ≈ 0.7071

Which corresponds to theta ≈ 45°, since cos(45°) ≈ 0.7071. 

But the problem states that ∠6 = 72°, so this setup gives ∠EHB = 45°, which doesn't match. So my coordinate choice still doesn't satisfy the given angle. 

What's the issue here? It seems that choosing specific coordinates leads to contradictions, suggesting that my assumptions about the positions of points might be incorrect. Maybe I need to adjust the coordinates to satisfy the given angle ∠6 = 72°. 

Let me attempt to calculate the general case. Let's suppose H is at (h_x, h_y), E is at (e_x, h_y) since HE is horizontal (parallel to AC). Point B is at some coordinates, say (b_x, b_y). Then vector HE is (e_x - h_x, 0), and vector HB is (b_x - h_x, b_y - h_y). 

The angle between HE and HB is ∠6 = 72°. Using the dot product formula:

cos(θ) = (HE • HB) / (|HE| |HB|)

HE • HB = (e_x - h_x)(b_x - h_x) + 0*(b_y - h_y) = (e_x - h_x)(b_x - h_x)

|HE| = sqrt((e_x - h_x)^2 + 0^2) = |e_x - h_x|

|HB| = sqrt((b_x - h_x)^2 + (b_y - h_y)^2)

Thus,

cos(θ) = [(e_x - h_x)(b_x - h_x)] / [ |e_x - h_x| * sqrt((b_x - h_x)^2 + (b_y - h_y)^2) ) ]

Assuming e_x > h_x, so e_x - h_x is positive, so |e_x - h_x| = e_x - h_x. Then:

cos(θ) = [ (e_x - h_x)(b_x - h_x) ] / [ (e_x - h_x) * sqrt(...) ) ] = (b_x - h_x)/sqrt(...)

So cos(θ) = (b_x - h_x)/sqrt((b_x - h_x)^2 + (b_y - h_y)^2 )

This simplifies to cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse, which is the cosine of the angle between HB and the x-axis. Wait, this suggests that θ is the angle between HB and the x-axis. 

But θ is given as ∠6 = 72°, so:

cos(72°) = (b_x - h_x)/sqrt((b_x - h_x)^2 + (b_y - h_y)^2 )

Let me denote Δx = b_x - h_x, Δy = b_y - h_y. Then:

cos(72°) = Δx / sqrt(Δx² + Δy²)

Square both sides:

cos²(72°) = Δx² / (Δx² + Δy²)

Rearranged:

Δx² + Δy² = Δx² / cos²(72°)

Subtract Δx²:

Δy² = Δx² (1/cos²(72°) - 1) = Δx² tan²(72°)

So Δy = ±Δx tan(72°)

Thus, the slope of HB is Δy/Δx = ±tan(72°). 

So the line HB has slope tan(72°) or -tan(72°). 

Given that, if I choose coordinates accordingly, I can ensure that ∠6 = 72°. 

Let me choose specific values. Let me set H at (0, 0) for simplicity. Wait, but C is at (0, 0) in my previous setup. Let me adjust. 

Let me reset coordinates:

Let me place point C at (0, 0). Let me choose H at (0, 0)? No, because H is on CB. Let me instead place H at (1, 0), and C at (0, 0). Let me define line CB passing through C(0,0) and H(1,0). Wait, but then line CB is horizontal, and HE is parallel to AC. Let me define AC as some other line. 

Alternatively, let me set H at (1, 0), and C at (0, 0). So line CB passes through C(0,0) and H(1,0), making it horizontal. Then, since HE is parallel to AC, and HE is a horizontal line (same as CB). Let me set AC to be vertical, so that HE (horizontal) is parallel to AC? No, that wouldn't work. Wait, if AC is vertical, then HE must also be vertical to be parallel. But I wanted HE to be horizontal. 

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I need to abandon coordinate geometry and focus on angle chasing.

We know that ∠6 = 72°, which is ∠EHB. Earlier, we deduced that ∠6 = ∠2, so ∠2 = 72°. 

Now, recall that ∠2 is ∠ACB, which is the angle at C between A and B. Since AC is parallel to HE, and if we consider the transversal CB, then ∠ACB and ∠EHB are corresponding angles? Wait, earlier I thought ∠EHB = ∠ACB, leading to ∠6 = ∠2. 

Yes, that was the key insight. So ∠6 = ∠2 = 72°, so ∠2 = 72°. 

Now, let's return to the earlier relations. 

We had ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, so ∠1 = ∠4. 

Now, what about other angles? Let's consider triangle BCG. In this triangle, ∠BCG = ∠4, and ∠CBG is some angle. Also, ∠BGC is another angle. 

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠1 is ∠FCA, which is the angle at C between F and A. 

Also, ∠3 is ∠GCF, which is the angle at C between G and F. 

As previously established, ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, so ∠1 = 180° - ∠3. 

But ∠1 = ∠4, so ∠4 = 180° - ∠3. 

Now, let's consider triangle BCG. Its angles are ∠BCG = ∠4, ∠CBG, and ∠BGC. Sum to 180°. 

If I can find expressions for ∠CBG or ∠BGC, I can relate them. 

But ∠CBG is the angle at B between C and G. Let's see if this relates to other angles. 

Since G is on line AG, and B is a point. If we can find a relationship between BG and other lines. 

Alternatively, consider line FG. Since F is on line BF, and G is on line AG. 

Wait, I'm running out of ideas. Let me think about the total sum of angles around point C. 

At point C, the angles around it include:

- ∠ACB = ∠2 = 72°
- ∠ACF = ∠1
- ∠GCF = ∠3
- ∠BCG = ∠4

But since points A, C, G are colinear, and B, C, F are colinear, the angles at C should add up appropriately. 

Wait, let me think of the full circle around point C. The angles around point C should sum to 360°. But since we're dealing with angles formed by lines, it depends on how many lines meet at C. 

At point C, there are lines CA, CB, CF, CG. So four lines: CA, CB, CF, CG. 

The angles between these lines are:

Between CA and CB: ∠ACB = ∠2 = 72°

Between CB and CF: since B, C, F are colinear, this is 180°

Between CF and CG: ? Let's call this angle α

Between CG and CA: ? Let's call this angle β

But these angles should add up to 360°. Wait, no. Around a point, the sum of angles is 360°. But since some angles are straight lines (180°), it's complex. 

Actually, since CA and CG are on the same line AG, the angle between CA and CG is 0° or 180°, depending on direction. Wait, if CA and CG are in opposite directions, then the angle between them is 180°. 

Wait, since A, C, G are colinear, then CA and CG are in opposite directions. So the angle between CA and CG is 180°. 

Similarly, CB and CF are in the same line, so angle between CB and CF is 0° or 180°, depending on direction. 

But this complicates things. Let me try to break it down. 

At point C, the lines are:

- CA (to A)
- CB (to B)
- CF (to F)
- CG (to G)

Since A, C, G are colinear, CA and CG are in opposite directions. So the angle between CA and CG is 180°. 

Similarly, B, C, F are colinear, so CB and CF are in the same line. 

So, the angles around point C would be:

- Between CA and CB: ∠ACB = 72°
- Between CB and CF: 0° (since they are the same line)
- Between CF and CG: ?
- Between CG and CA: 180°

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe better to think about the angles formed by the non-straight lines. 

The non-straight angles at point C are:

- ∠ACB = 72°
- ∠ACF = ∠1
- ∠GCF = ∠3
- ∠BCG = ∠4

But how do these fit together?

Since CF is part of line BF, and CG is part of line AG, which is a different line. So, the angle between CF (line BF) and CG (line AG) is ∠GCF + ∠ACF? Wait, no. 

Let me imagine standing at point C. Line CA goes to A, line CG goes to G (opposite direction). Line CF goes to F (part of BF). So, from CA to CF, there is ∠ACF = ∠1. From CF to CG, there is ∠GCF = ∠3. Since CA and CG are opposite, the total angle from CA to CG is ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, as we had earlier. 

Also, the angle between CB and CF is 0° (since they are colinear), and the angle between CB and CA is ∠ACB = 72°. 

But how does ∠BCG come into play? ∠BCG is the angle between CB and CG. Since CB is one line, and CG is the line from C to G. Since CG is opposite to CA, the angle between CB and CG is ∠BCG = ∠4. 

So, at point C, the angles are:

- Between CB and CG: ∠4
- Between CG and CA: 180° (since CA and CG are opposite)
- Between CA and CB: 72°
- Between CB and CF: 0°
- Between CF and CG: ∠3 (since ∠GCF = ∠3)

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to write equations. 

From earlier, we have ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠4 = ∠1. Also, ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, which is consistent. 

Now, let's think about triangle BCG. In this triangle, we have ∠BCG = ∠4, and we need to find other angles. 

If I can find ∠CBG or ∠BGC, then I can use the triangle angle sum. 

But how? Let's see. 

∠CBG is the angle at B between C and G. Let me consider line BG. If I can relate this angle to other parts of the diagram. 

Since G is on line AG, and B is a point. If I can find a relationship between BG and other lines. 

Alternatively, consider that line BG might be related to other parallel lines or transversals. 

Alternatively, since HE || AC, and if line BG intersects HE or something, but I don't see it immediately. 

Let me think about the given that ∠6 = 72°, which is ∠EHB, and we deduced that ∠2 = 72°, which is ∠ACB. 

Now, let's consider triangle ABC. Wait, point G is on AG, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since ∠ACB = 72°, and ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, which gives ∠1 = ∠4. 

Let me try to find a relationship between ∠3 and other angles. 

Let me recall that ∠3 is ∠GCF, which is the angle at C between G and F. As part of the line CF (BF), and CG (AG). 

If I can find the measure of ∠GCF, which is ∠3, then since m∠3 = x - 12, we can solve for x. 

To find ∠3, I need to relate it to known angles. 

Let me consider the straight line through C: AG and BF. 

At point C, the angles around it include ∠ACB = 72°, and the angles involving ∠1, ∠3, and ∠4. 

Wait, from earlier, we have ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠4 = ∠1. 

But also, ∠4 is ∠BCG. So ∠BCG = ∠1. 

Now, let's consider triangle BCG. In this triangle, we have ∠BCG = ∠1, and we need to find other angles. 

If I can find another angle in this triangle, like ∠CBG or ∠BGC, then I can use the triangle angle sum. 

Let me try to find ∠CBG. 

∠CBG is the angle at B between C and G. Let me see if this angle relates to other parts. 

Since G is on line AG, and B is connected to C. If I can find a relationship between BG and other lines. 

Alternatively, since HE || AC, and if there's a transversal through B, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, let me recall that ∠EHB = 72°, and ∠EHB is part of triangle EHB. If I can find other angles in this triangle, maybe I can find something. 

In triangle EHB, we have ∠EHB = 72°, and if we can find other angles, like ∠HBE or ∠BEH. 

Let me consider ∠HBE. This is the angle at B between H and E. 

But H is on line CB, so BH is part of line CB. So ∠HBE is the angle at B between H and E. 

Since H is on CB, and E is some point. If I can relate this angle to other angles. 

Alternatively, since HE || AC, and line BE is a transversal. 

Wait, if HE || AC, then the angle between BE and HE is equal to the angle between BE and AC. 

Let me denote ∠BEH as the angle at E between B and H. Since HE || AC, then ∠BEH = ∠BAC. 

Wait, ∠BEH is at E, and ∠BAC is at A. Are these corresponding angles? If BE is a transversal cutting HE and AC. 

But for this to be true, BE must be a transversal. Let me assume that. 

So, if HE || AC, and BE is a transversal, then ∠BEH = ∠BAC. 

Let me denote ∠BEH = ∠BAC. 

Now, in triangle EHB, the angles are:

∠EHB = 72°, ∠BEH = ∠BAC, and ∠HBE. 

Sum to 180°, so:

72° + ∠BAC + ∠HBE = 180°

=> ∠BAC + ∠HBE = 108°

But ∠HBE is the angle at B between H and E, which is part of ∠ABC or something. 

But I don't know ∠BAC or ∠HBE. 

However, ∠BAC is part of triangle ABC. Let me consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have ∠ACB = 72°, and if we can find other angles. 

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's difficult. 

Let me think about ∠BAC. Since AC is parallel to HE, and if there's a relationship between ∠BAC and other angles. 

Alternatively, since ∠BAC is part of line AG, and G is on AG. 

Wait, this seems too vague. Let me try to connect the dots. 

From earlier, we have ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. 

If I can express ∠4 in terms of other angles, maybe I can find ∠3. 

∠4 is ∠BCG. Let me consider triangle BCG. In this triangle, ∠BCG = ∠4, ∠CBG = ?, and ∠BGC = ?. 

If I can find ∠CBG or ∠BGC, then I can use the triangle angle sum. 

Let me assume that line BG is a transversal. If I can relate ∠CBG to other angles. 

Alternatively, since ∠BCG = ∠4 = ∠1, and ∠1 is ∠FCA. 

∠FCA is the angle at C between F and A. Since F is on line BF, and A is on line AG. 

So, ∠FCA is the angle between CF (part of BF) and CA (part of AG). 

Which we already used to say ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. 

Let me try to consider the sum of angles in triangle CFG or something. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- ∠2 = 72°
- ∠5 = 72°
- ∠6 = 72°
- ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°
- ∠3 + ∠4 = 180° => ∠1 = ∠4
- Need to find ∠3 = x - 12

Let me assume that ∠3 is part of a triangle where I can apply the angle sum. 

Let me consider triangle CFG. Wait, C, F, G are points. 

At point C, ∠GCF = ∠3. At point F, ∠CFG is something. At point G, ∠FGC is something. But without knowing more about this triangle, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but if I can relate ∠3 to other angles. 

Since ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠1 is ∠FCA, which is the angle at C between F and A. 

And ∠4 is ∠BCG, the angle at C between B and G. 

If I can find a relationship between ∠FCA and ∠BCG. 

Since A, C, G are colinear, and B, C, F are colinear. 

So, the lines CA and CG are in a straight line, and lines CB and CF are in a straight line. 

So, the angle between CA and CB is ∠ACB = 72°, and the angle between CB and CG is ∠BCG = ∠4 = ∠1. 

So, if I imagine the lines at point C: 

- CA and CG are in a straight line (opposite directions)
- CB and CF are in a straight line (same direction)
- The angle between CA and CB is 72°
- The angle between CB and CG is ∠4 = ∠1

So, if I consider the full rotation around point C, the angles would be:

- From CA to CB: 72°
- From CB to CG: ∠4
- From CG to CA: 180° (since CA and CG are opposite)

But this totals 72° + ∠4 + 180°, which exceeds 360°, so this approach is incorrect. 

Wait, no. The angles around a point should add up to 360°. Let me think again. 

At point C, the angles formed by the lines CA, CB, CF, CG. 

Since CA and CG are in a straight line, the angle between them is 180°. 

The angle between CB and CF is 0°, since they are the same line. 

The remaining angles are between CA and CB (72°), and between CG and CB (which is ∠BCG = ∠4). 

Wait, but how do these fit? 

Let me imagine standing at point C. 

- Line CA goes to A.
- Line CB goes to B.
- Line CF goes to F (same as CB).
- Line CG goes to G (opposite of CA).

So, from CA to CB is ∠ACB = 72°. 

From CB to CG is ∠BCG = ∠4. 

From CG to CA is 180°, as CA and CG are opposite. 

But these three angles would add up to 72° + ∠4 + 180° = 252° + ∠4, which is less than 360°. This suggests there are other angles. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing angles on the other side. 

Actually, the full 360° around point C includes:

- The angle between CA and CB: 72°
- The angle between CB and CG: ∠4
- The angle between CG and CA: 180°
- Plus the reflex angles? No, typically, we consider the smaller angles. 

This suggests that my understanding is incomplete. 

Let me try a different approach. Since ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠3 + ∠4 = 180°, this implies that ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠3 = 180° - ∠1. 

But without additional information, I cannot determine the value of ∠3. 

However, the problem provides that m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72°. We need to find x. 

Wait, but we have ∠6 = 72°, and earlier we determined ∠6 = ∠2 = 72°. 

Is there a way to relate ∠3 to ∠6? 

Let me think about the angles in triangle BCG. 

In triangle BCG, we have ∠BCG = ∠4 = ∠1, and if we can find another angle, say ∠CBG, then we can find ∠BGC. 

Let me assume that ∠CBG is equal to ∠6 = 72°. Why? Because if line BG is parallel to something or creates corresponding angles. 

But why would ∠CBG be 72°? Let me think. 

If HE || AC, and if line BG is a transversal, then maybe ∠CBG is equal to ∠EHB = 72°. 

Let me explain: If line BG is a transversal cutting HE and AC, then ∠CBG would be equal to ∠EHB due to corresponding angles. 

But for this to be true, line BG must be a transversal to the parallel lines HE and AC. 

If HE || AC, and line BG intersects both, then ∠CBG (at B) would correspond to ∠EHB (at H). 

Yes! If line BG intersects HE at H and AC at some point, then ∠CBG would be equal to ∠EHB. 

But where does line BG intersect AC? If line BG extends, it might intersect AC at point G or somewhere else. 

Wait, G is on line AG, and B is a point. So line BG connects B to G. Since G is on AG, which is a line through C. 

So line BG connects B to G, and since G is on AG, which passes through C. 

So, line BG passes through G, which is on AG. 

If line BG intersects AC at G, then at point G, the line BG meets AC. 

So, if HE || AC, and line BG intersects HE at H and AC at G, then ∠CBG (at B) and ∠EHB (at H) are corresponding angles, hence equal. 

Therefore, ∠CBG = ∠EHB = 72°. 

Yes! This makes sense. 

So, in triangle BCG, we have:

∠BCG = ∠4 = ∠1

∠CBG = 72°

Therefore, the third angle at G, ∠BGC = 180° - ∠4 - 72° = 108° - ∠4. 

But we also know that ∠4 = ∠1, and from earlier, ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°. 

So, ∠1 = 180° - ∠3. 

Substituting into the expression for ∠BGC:

∠BGC = 108° - (180° - ∠3) = 108° - 180° + ∠3 = ∠3 - 72°. 

But ∠BGC is also an angle in the diagram. Is there a way to relate ∠BGC to other angles? 

Let me consider line CG, which is part of AG. If I can find ∠BGC in terms of other angles. 

Alternatively, since ∠BGC is part of triangle BCG, and we might relate it to other parts. 

But I'm not seeing it directly. 

Wait, let me think about line CG and line HE. Since HE || AC, and if there's a transversal through G. 

Line CG is part of AG, which is parallel to HE. So, line CG is parallel to HE. 

Wait, no. AC is parallel to HE, and CG is part of AG. So, if AC is parallel to HE, then CG is also parallel to HE, since CG is part of AG. 

Yes! Because CG is part of AG, and AC is parallel to HE. So, CG is parallel to HE. 

Therefore, line CG is parallel to HE. 

Now, line CG is parallel to HE, and line BG is a transversal intersecting both. 

So, the angle between CG and BG (∠BGC) is equal to the angle between HE and BG (∠HBE). 

Wait, since CG || HE, and BG is a transversal, then ∠BGC = ∠HBE. 

So, ∠BGC = ∠HBE. 

From earlier, ∠BGC = ∠3 - 72°, and ∠HBE is part of triangle EHB. 

In triangle EHB, we have:

∠EHB = 72°, ∠HBE = ∠BGC = ∠3 - 72°, and ∠BEH = ?

Sum to 180°, so:

72° + (∠3 - 72°) + ∠BEH = 180°

Simplify: ∠3 + ∠BEH = 180°

So, ∠BEH = 180° - ∠3. 

But ∠BEH is also an angle in the diagram. Let me see if I can relate it to other angles. 

Since HE || AC, and BE is a transversal, ∠BEH = ∠BAC. 

Yes! Because HE || AC, and BE is a transversal, so ∠BEH (at E) is equal to ∠BAC (at A) due to corresponding angles. 

So, ∠BEH = ∠BAC = 180° - ∠3. 

Now, let's consider triangle ABC. In this triangle, we have ∠ACB = 72°, and ∠BAC = 180° - ∠3. 

The third angle at B, ∠ABC, is:

∠ABC = 180° - ∠BAC - ∠ACB = 180° - (180° - ∠3) - 72° = ∠3 - 72°. 

But ∠ABC is also composed of other angles. For example, ∠ABC could be related to ∠CBG, which we earlier found to be 72°. 

Wait, ∠ABC is the angle at B between A and C. If line BG divides this angle, then ∠ABC = ∠ABG + ∠GBE. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since ∠CBG = 72°, and ∠ABC = ∠3 - 72°, then:

If ∠ABC = ∠3 - 72°, and ∠CBG = 72°, then ∠ABG = ∠ABC - ∠CBG = (∠3 - 72°) - 72° = ∠3 - 144°. 

But this might not be meaningful unless we have more information. 

Alternatively, since ∠ABC = ∠3 - 72°, and ∠ABC is a valid angle measure, it must be positive. So:

∠3 - 72° > 0 => ∠3 > 72°. 

But we also have from earlier that ∠1 + ∠3 = 180°, and ∠1 = ∠4. 

But without more constraints, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but let's recall that ∠BEH = ∠BAC = 180° - ∠3. Also, in triangle ABC, ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°. 

We have:

∠BAC = 180° - ∠3

∠ACB = 72°

∠ABC = ∠3 - 72°

Adding these: (180° - ∠3) + 72° + (∠3 - 72°) = 180°, which checks out. 

So this is consistent. 

But how does this help us find ∠3? 

We need another equation involving ∠3. 

Let me think about the angle ∠BEH = 180° - ∠3. But ∠BEH is also part of another triangle or figure. 

Alternatively, since ∠BEH = ∠BAC = 180° - ∠3, and ∠BAC is part of line AG. 

Wait, line AG passes through C and G. So, if I consider triangle ABG, but I don't have enough information about it. 

Alternatively, since ∠BAC = 180° - ∠3, and ∠1 = ∠4, and ∠1 is ∠FCA. 

Let me recall that ∠FCA = ∠1, and ∠1 = ∠4. 

But ∠FCA is the angle at C between F and A. Which is the same as ∠ACF.
