CHOICES:
A. 30
B. 45
C. 60
D. 90

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a triangle where the ratio of its angles is 3:2:1. We need to figure out which of the given options isn't an angle measure in this triangle. The answer choices are 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees. 

First, I remember that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Since the ratios are given as 3:2:1, maybe I can represent each angle as multiples of a common variable. Let me think... If the ratios are 3, 2, and 1, then let's denote the measures of the angles as 3x, 2x, and x respectively. That makes sense because they're in the ratio 3:2:1. 

So adding them up, the total should be 3x + 2x + x = 6x. And since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, 6x = 180. Solving for x would give x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees. Wait, so x is 30? Then the three angles would be:

- First angle: 3x = 3*30 = 90 degrees
- Second angle: 2x = 2*30 = 60 degrees
- Third angle: x = 30 degrees

So the angles are 90°, 60°, and 30°. Let me check that they add up to 180: 90 + 60 + 30 = 180. Yep, that works. 

Now, looking at the answer choices: A is 30, which is one of the angles. B is 45, which isn't among the angles here. C is 60, which is there. D is 90, also present. Therefore, the one that is not an angle measure is 45 degrees. So the answer should be B. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I do the ratios correctly? The ratio is 3:2:1. So the largest angle is 3 parts, then 2, then 1. So when x=30, the angles are 90, 60, 30. So yes, those are the measures. So 45 isn't there. So the answer is B. 

But just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think: suppose someone thought the ratio was different? For example, maybe misreading the ratio? But the question says 3:2:1. So no, that's correct. Alternatively, could there be another interpretation? Like maybe the triangle is not a right triangle? Well, according to our calculation, it is a right triangle because one angle is 90 degrees. So that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that the angles are in the order 3:2:1 but assign them differently? For instance, maybe thinking that the angles are 3x, 2x, x, but perhaps miscalculating the value of x. But no, the math seems straightforward. Sum is 6x = 180, so x=30. 

Therefore, the angles are indeed 30, 60, 90. Hence, 45 is not among them. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine which angle measure is **not** part of the triangle described by the ratio $ 3 : 2 : 1 $, we begin by using the fundamental property of triangles: the **sum of the interior angles is always $ 180^\circ $**.

---

### Step 1: Represent the Angles Using the Ratio

Let’s define the angles based on their ratio:

$$
\text{Angles} = 3x,\ 2x,\ \text{and}\ x
$$

Add these together:

$$
3x + 2x + x = 6x
$$

Set the sum equal to $ 180^\circ $ (since the sum of angles in a triangle is always $ 180^\circ $):

$$
6x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x = \frac{180}{6} = 30^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate Each Angle

Using $ x = 30^\circ $:

- First angle: $ 3x = 3(30) = 90^\circ $
- Second angle: $ 2x = 2(30) = 60^\circ $
- Third angle: $ x = 30^\circ $

Thus, the angles of the triangle are:

$$
90^\circ,\ 60^\circ,\ 30^\circ
$$

These values satisfy both the given ratio and the triangle angle sum condition.

---

### Step 3: Compare with Given Options

Now compare the computed angle measures ($ 30^\circ,\ 60^\circ,\ 90^\circ $) against the answer choices:

- **A. 30** → ✅ Present  
- **B. 45** → ❌ Not present  
- **C. 60** → ✅ Present  
- **D. 90** → ✅ Present  

Hence, the only option that does **not** correspond to any of the triangle’s angles is **45**.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
