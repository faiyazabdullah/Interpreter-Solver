MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by restating the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have a triangle ABC. The problem states that CP is an altitude, so that means CP is perpendicular to AB. Then, CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB. Also, R is the midpoint of AB. We're told that the measure of angle ACB is 123 - x degrees, and the measure of angle QCB is 42 + x degrees. We need to find the measure of angle ACQ.

Wait, angle ACQ... So angle ACQ is part of angle ACB, right? Because CQ is the angle bisector. Wait, but hold on—if CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB, then it should split angle ACB into two equal parts. But here, they mention angle QCB as 42 + x. If CQ is the bisector, then angles ACQ and QCB should be equal. However, according to the problem, angle ACB is 123 - x, which would mean each of those two angles (ACQ and QCB) would be half of that. But wait, the problem says angle QCB is 42 + x. So maybe there's some relation between these?

Let me write down the equations. Let me denote:

Let’s call angle ACB as θ. According to the problem, θ = 123 - x. Since CQ is the angle bisector, then angle ACQ equals angle QCB. Therefore, angle ACQ = angle QCB = θ / 2. But the problem states that angle QCB is 42 + x. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

θ / 2 = 42 + x.

But since θ is also given as 123 - x, substituting that gives:

(123 - x)/2 = 42 + x.

Now solving for x:

Multiply both sides by 2:

123 - x = 84 + 2x

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

123 - 84 = 2x + x

39 = 3x

So x = 13.

Then, angle ACQ is θ/2, which is (123 - x)/2. Plugging x=13:

123 - 13 = 110, divided by 2 is 55 degrees. So angle ACQ is 55 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 55. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me check again. Is there something wrong here? Because the problem mentions points lying on lines, like PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(R, A)), etc. Maybe there are more constraints? Or perhaps my initial assumption that CQ is the bisector leading to angle ACQ being equal to angle QCB is incorrect?

Wait, the problem says CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB. That should mean that it splits angle ACB into two equal angles. So angle ACQ and angle QCB are equal. Hence, their measures are equal. Therefore, angle ACB = angle ACQ + angle QCB = 2 * angle ACQ. Therefore, angle ACQ = angle ACB / 2. But angle ACB is given as 123 - x, and angle QCB is given as 42 + x. Therefore, angle ACQ equals angle QCB, so:

angle QCB = 42 + x = angle ACB / 2 = (123 - x)/2.

Therefore, solving 42 + x = (123 - x)/2.

Which leads to multiplying both sides by 2: 84 + 2x = 123 - x → 3x = 39 → x = 13. Then angle ACQ = angle QCB = 42 + 13 = 55 degrees. So yes, same conclusion. Therefore, answer D.

But why does the problem give all those point lies on line constraints? Maybe they are red herrings, or maybe they are part of a diagram that's supposed to help us confirm certain relationships. For example, maybe R is the midpoint of AB, so AR = RB. Also, CP is an altitude, meaning that CP is perpendicular to AB. And Q is a point such that CQ is the angle bisector. But perhaps the problem includes additional constraints based on those points lying on lines. However, since the question only asks about angle ACQ, and given that CQ is the angle bisector, maybe those other conditions don't affect the calculation here. Unless there's some property related to midpoints and altitudes that affects the angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that angle ACQ equals angle QCB because of the angle bisector. Wait, no—by definition, an angle bisector divides the angle into two equal parts. So unless there's some other condition, like CQ not being the bisector, but the problem says it is. So I think my reasoning holds. 

Another way to check: suppose x=13, then angle ACB is 123-13=110 degrees. Then angle ACQ is 110/2=55 degrees, and angle QCB is 42+13=55 degrees. So that checks out. Therefore, angle ACQ is 55 degrees. Which matches answer D.

So even though there are other constraints mentioned, they might be for another part of the problem or just to define the configuration. Since the key relations are about the angle bisector and the expressions given for the angles, the answer is 55 degrees, which is option D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle ACQ $, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- **CP** is an **altitude**, implying it is perpendicular to segment $ AB $.
- **CQ** is the **angle bisector** of $ \angle ACB $, so it divides $ \angle ACB $ into two equal parts: $ \angle ACQ = \angle QCB $.
- **R** is the **midpoint** of $ AB $, indicating symmetry in the triangle.
- Given values:
  - $ m\angle ACB = 123 - x $
  - $ m\angle QCB = 42 + x $

---

### Step 1: Use the Angle Bisector Property

Since $ CQ $ is the angle bisector of $ \angle ACB $, we know:

$$
m\angle ACQ = m\angle QCB
$$

Thus,

$$
m\angle ACQ = m\angle QCB = 42 + x
$$

Also, since $ m\angle ACB = m\angle ACQ + m\angle QCB $, and both are equal, we can write:

$$
m\angle ACB = 2 \cdot (42 + x)
$$

But we are also given that:

$$
m\angle ACB = 123 - x
$$

Equating these two expressions:

$$
2(42 + x) = 123 - x
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Expand and simplify:

$$
84 + 2x = 123 - x
$$

Add $ x $ to both sides:

$$
84 + 3x = 123
$$

Subtract 84 from both sides:

$$
3x = 39 \Rightarrow x = 13
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute $ m\angle ACQ $

Recall that:

$$
m\angle ACQ = 42 + x = 42 + 13 = 55^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{D}
$$

Final Answer: D
