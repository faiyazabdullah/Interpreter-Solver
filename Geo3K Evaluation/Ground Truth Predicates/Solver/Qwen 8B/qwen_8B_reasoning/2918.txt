====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have points G, H, F, J, K with some lines and distances given. The goal is to find x such that line segments GJ and FK are parallel. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

First, the constraints mentioned are:

- Point L lies on line HF? Wait, no, the original problem says "PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(H, F))". Hmm, maybe there was a typo in the question? Or perhaps it's supposed to be that point G lies on line HF? Because "PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(H, F))" might mean that point G is on the line connecting H and F. Similarly, "PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, K))" means point J is on the line connecting H and K. 

Assuming that, then G is on line HF and J is on line HK. Also, given lengths:

GH = x + 3.5,

HJ = x - 8.5,

FH = 21,

HK = 7.

We need to find x such that GJ is parallel to FK.

So, since GJ || FK, maybe we can use similar triangles or the concept of slopes? But since coordinates aren't given, maybe using ratios based on segment lengths?

Let me visualize the diagram. Points H, F, and K are involved. Since G is on HF, and J is on HK. Let me sketch mentally:

- Line HF has points H and F, with FH = 21. So the distance between H and F is 21 units. Then, GH is part of HF. If G is on HF, then GH is a segment from G to H. Wait, but if G is on HF, then depending on where G is, GH could be part of HF. For example, if G is between H and F, then GH would be part of HF. But if G is beyond H, then GH would extend past H. However, the length GH is given as x + 3.5. Similarly, HJ is x - 8.5, which is the length from H to J, but J is on HK. So HK is 7 units long. Therefore, HJ cannot be longer than HK unless J is extended beyond K.

But first, let's note that for HJ to be positive (since lengths can't be negative), x - 8.5 > 0 => x > 8.5. Similarly, GH = x + 3.5 must be positive, which is always true since x > 8.5 implies x + 3.5 > 12. So that's okay.

Now, since GJ is parallel to FK, perhaps we can use the property that if two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal, leading to similar triangles. Alternatively, using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, maybe using the theorem that if two lines are cut by transversals, the ratio of the segments is equal. Wait, since GJ || FK, maybe triangle similarity?

Wait, but I need to think about how these points are connected. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point to make it easier.

Let me place point H at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since FH = 21, and assuming that line HF is along the x-axis, then point F would be at (21, 0). Now, point G is on line HF. Let me assume that G is somewhere on HF. Since GH = x + 3.5, then the coordinate of G depends on whether it's between H and F or not.

If G is between H and F, then HG = x + 3.5, so since HF is 21, then GF = HF - HG = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x. But if G is beyond H, then HG would be in the opposite direction. However, without knowing the exact position, maybe we need to consider both possibilities. But given that HJ is x - 8.5, and J is on HK, which is another line. Let me check HK's length. HK is 7. So if J is on HK, then HJ can be up to 7 if J is between H and K, but if J is beyond K, then HJ would be more than 7. However, since HJ = x - 8.5, and x > 8.5, then HJ is positive. So J could be on HK extended beyond K or between H and K. But let's see.

Similarly, for G being on HF. Let me suppose that G is between H and F. Then HG = x + 3.5. Since HF is 21, then HG must be less than 21. So x + 3.5 < 21 => x < 17.5. But also, since HJ = x - 8.5, and J is on HK. If J is between H and K, then HJ ≤ HK = 7. So x - 8.5 ≤ 7 => x ≤ 15.5. But if J is beyond K, then HJ would be greater than 7. So possible values for x depend on where J is located. However, since we don't know yet, maybe we can proceed with variables.

But since we need to find x such that GJ || FK. Let me think about the slope condition. If we assign coordinates, then we can compute the slopes of GJ and FK and set them equal.

Let me proceed with coordinates. Let me fix H at (0, 0), F at (21, 0). Then line HF is the x-axis. Now, point G is on HF. Let me find its coordinates. If G is between H and F, then moving from H(0,0) towards F(21,0), the distance from H to G is x + 3.5. Therefore, the coordinate of G would be (x + 3.5, 0). Wait, because moving along the x-axis, starting at H(0,0), so adding x + 3.5 in the x-direction gives G's coordinate. Wait, but that would only be true if G is between H and F. However, if x + 3.5 exceeds 21, then G would be beyond F. But given that earlier we had x < 17.5 if G is between H and F, but x could be larger if G is beyond F. However, let's tentatively assume that G is between H and F. Let's keep that assumption for now.

Then, point J is on line HK. First, we need to define point K. Since HK = 7. Let me assume that line HK is another line; but the problem didn't specify the direction. Wait, the initial constraint was that J lies on line HK. So line HK connects H and K. But where is K? Since FH is given, but K is another point. Without loss of generality, perhaps we can assign coordinates to K. Let me assume that line HK is vertical or something else? Wait, but without knowing the angle between HF and HK, maybe we need to assign coordinates accordingly.

Alternatively, since the problem involves parallelism, maybe we can use vectors or ratios. Let me think again.

Since GJ || FK, the vector GJ should be a scalar multiple of vector FK. Alternatively, their slopes must be equal.

To calculate slopes, we need coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates properly.

Let me take H at (0, 0), F at (21, 0) as before. Now, line HK: we need to determine coordinates of K. However, since HK = 7, but the direction isn't specified. This seems like a problem. How can we determine the coordinates of K? Maybe there's missing info here?

Wait, but maybe the fact that J is on line HK allows us to express coordinates of J in terms of K. But without knowing the direction of HK, it's difficult. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since we have two lines: HF and HK. If we can assume that lines HF and HK are not necessarily perpendicular, but maybe they form some angle. However, without specific information, maybe we need to use ratios based on similar triangles?

Wait, maybe using the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem), which states that if two lines are cut by transversals, then the ratio of the segments is equal if the lines are parallel.

But for that, we need to have lines intersecting at certain points. Let me think.

Suppose that lines GK and ... wait, maybe considering triangles or something else. Wait, GJ || FK. So if we can find triangles where these sides are parts of, maybe.

Alternatively, since G is on HF and J is on HK, and we want GJ || FK. Let me imagine drawing lines GJ and FK. For them to be parallel, the direction from G to J must be same as direction from F to K.

Alternatively, using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates again, trying to define K.

Assume that line HK is arbitrary, but let me define coordinates for K. Suppose that line HK is in some direction, say making an angle θ with the x-axis. Then coordinates of K can be expressed as (a, b), such that the distance from H(0,0) to K(a,b) is 7. So sqrt(a² + b²) = 7. However, without knowing θ, it's hard to proceed. Unless there's another relation.

But perhaps since J is on HK, we can write coordinates for J in terms of parameter t. Let me denote parametric coordinates.

Let me parametrize line HK. Let me suppose that K is at some point (p, q), with distance from H(0,0) to K(p,q) being 7. Then, any point J on HK can be written as H + t*(K - H) = (tp, tq), where t is a real number. The distance from H to J is |t| * |HK|. Since |HK| = 7, then HJ = |t|*7. Given that HJ = x - 8.5, then |t| = (x - 8.5)/7. Depending on the direction of t, J could be between H and K (if t is between 0 and 1) or beyond K (if t > 1) or behind H (if t < 0).

Similarly, for point G on HF. Since HF is from H(0,0) to F(21,0). Let me parametrize G similarly. Let me say that G divides HF in some ratio. The distance from H to G is GH = x + 3.5. Since HF = 21, then if G is between H and F, the coordinate of G is (GH, 0) = (x + 3.5, 0). But if G is beyond F, then the coordinate would be (21 + (x + 3.5 - 21), 0) = (x - 17.5, 0). Wait, but this complicates things. However, since we don't know where G is, maybe we need to handle both cases. However, given that HJ = x - 8.5, and if J is between H and K, then x - 8.5 must be <= 7 => x <= 15.5. But if G is between H and F, then x + 3.5 <= 21 => x <= 17.5. So x could be between 8.5 and 15.5 in that case. But maybe there's another scenario.

However, regardless of the position of G and J, we need GJ || FK. So, to find the condition for parallelism, maybe using vectors.

Vector GJ = J - G.

Vector FK = K - F.

For these vectors to be parallel, they must be scalar multiples of each other. So, there exists a scalar k such that:

J - G = k*(K - F)

But since we have coordinates for G, H, F, and expressions for J and K, maybe we can substitute.

But since we don't know the coordinates of K, maybe we need another approach.

Wait, but perhaps using mass point or ratios?

Another idea: since G is on HF and J is on HK, and GJ || FK, then triangles HFG and HJK might be related? Not sure.

Wait, if GJ || FK, then the slope of GJ equals slope of FK. Let me try to express coordinates again.

Let me assume coordinates as follows:

- H = (0, 0)
- F = (21, 0)
- Let’s assume that K is at (0, 7), so that HK is vertical, making it simple. Wait, but then HK would be from (0,0) to (0,7). Then, point J is on HK, so J would have coordinates (0, y), where y ranges from 0 to 7. Then, HJ = y, since distance from H(0,0) to J(0,y) is |y|. Given that HJ = x - 8.5, then y = x - 8.5. But since y must be between 0 and 7 (assuming J is between H and K), then x - 8.5 ∈ [0,7], so x ∈ [8.5, 15.5]. That makes sense.

Now, point G is on HF. Let me assume that G is on HF, which is horizontal from (0,0) to (21,0). So G has coordinates (g, 0), where g is between 0 and 21 if between H and F, or outside otherwise. Given that GH = x + 3.5. Since GH is the distance from G to H, which is |g - 0| = |g|. So |g| = x + 3.5. Assuming G is between H and F, then g = x + 3.5. But since HF is from 0 to 21, then x + 3.5 ≤ 21 ⇒ x ≤ 17.5. Which matches with previous range if x is between 8.5 and 15.5.

So G is at (x + 3.5, 0).

Now, point J is at (0, x - 8.5), since it's on HK which we assumed vertical from (0,0) to (0,7). So coordinates:

- G: (x + 3.5, 0)
- J: (0, x - 8.5)
- F: (21, 0)
- K: (0, 7)

Now, we need GJ || FK.

Compute the slope of GJ and slope of FK.

First, slope of GJ: (y_J - y_G)/(x_J - x_G) = [(x - 8.5 - 0)] / [0 - (x + 3.5)] = (x - 8.5)/(-x - 3.5) = -(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5)

Slope of FK: (y_K - y_F)/(x_K - x_F) = (7 - 0)/(0 - 21) = 7/(-21) = -1/3

Set the slopes equal for parallelism:

-(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5) = -1/3

Multiply both sides by -1:

(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5) = 1/3

Cross-multiplying:

3(x - 8.5) = 1*(x + 3.5)

Expand:

3x - 25.5 = x + 3.5

Subtract x from both sides:

2x - 25.5 = 3.5

Add 25.5 to both sides:

2x = 3.5 + 25.5 = 29

Divide by 2:

x = 29 / 2 = 14.5

So x = 14.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me verify my assumption that K is at (0,7). Because I arbitrarily placed K at (0,7) to make HK vertical. Is this valid? Because the problem didn't specify the orientation of HK, but since we're dealing with parallel lines, the actual direction might not matter due to the proportionality. However, choosing coordinates this way simplifies calculations and since the answer came out consistent, maybe it's acceptable.

But let me check if there's another possibility. What if K wasn't on the y-axis? Would that affect the result?

Suppose instead that line HK is not vertical. Let me try another approach without assuming coordinates for K.

Let me think of vectors again. Vector FK = K - F. Vector GJ = J - G.

For these vectors to be parallel, there exists λ such that:

J - G = λ(K - F)

But since J is on HK, we can write J = H + t(K - H), where t is a scalar between 0 and 1 if J is between H and K. Similarly, G is on HF, so G = H + s(F - H), where s is a scalar. Let me define s and t.

Given that GH = x + 3.5. Since GH is the distance from G to H, which would be |s| * |HF|. Wait, if G is on HF, then the distance from H to G is s * |HF| if moving from H to F. Wait, actually, if G is on HF, then HG = s * HF, where s is the fraction from H to F. Wait, but if s is between 0 and 1, then G is between H and F. If s > 1, G is beyond F. If s < 0, G is beyond H.

But given that GH = x + 3.5, and HF = 21, then:

HG = |s| * |HF| ?

Actually, if we parametrize G as H + s*(F - H), then the distance from H to G is |s| * |HF|, but only if s is a scalar multiplier along the vector. However, if s is a scalar such that when s=0, G=H, and s=1, G=F. So yes, the distance from H to G would be |s| * |HF|. But since we have GH = x + 3.5, then:

If G is between H and F, then s is positive, and HG = s * HF => x + 3.5 = s * 21 → s = (x + 3.5)/21.

Similarly, for J on HK: let me parametrize J as H + t*(K - H). Then, the distance from H to J is |t| * |HK|. Since HK = 7, then HJ = |t| * 7. Given that HJ = x - 8.5, then |t| = (x - 8.5)/7. So t = ±(x - 8.5)/7. Depending on direction.

Now, the vector GJ = J - G = [H + t*(K - H)] - [H + s*(F - H)] = t*(K - H) - s*(F - H).

The vector FK = K - F.

For GJ || FK, there exists λ such that:

t*(K - H) - s*(F - H) = λ*(K - F)

This equation must hold. To satisfy this, the vectors must be scalar multiples. But without knowing the relationship between K and F, it's challenging. However, if we assume that lines HF and HK are not colinear, and that the configuration allows for such a scalar multiple, then we can derive equations.

But perhaps there's another approach. Let me think of the coordinates again. Earlier assumption gave x = 14.5, which is option C. Let me check if that value satisfies all conditions.

If x = 14.5, then:

GH = 14.5 + 3.5 = 18. So G is 18 units away from H along HF. Since HF is 21 units, G is between H and F, 18 units from H, so 3 units away from F.

HJ = 14.5 - 8.5 = 6. So J is 6 units from H along HK. Since HK = 7, J is between H and K, 6 units from H, 1 unit from K.

In this case, with coordinates as before, GJ slope was -(x - 8.5)/(x + 3.5) = -(6)/(18) = -1/3, which matched the slope of FK (-1/3). Hence, parallel. So this works.

Therefore, even though I made an assumption about the coordinate system, the result holds. Thus, the answer is 14.5, which is option C.

Let me check if there's another possibility if K were placed differently. Suppose K is not on the y-axis but somewhere else. For instance, suppose HK is horizontal, but then K would be at (7, 0), but then J would be on HK, which is same line as HF. But that might cause GJ and FK to be collinear or something else. But in that case, the calculation may vary. However, since the problem didn't specify directions, but the answer came consistently under one coordinate setup, and given that the answer options include 14.5 (option C), which is likely the correct answer.

Thus, the correct answer is C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ such that $ GJ \parallel FK $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and leveraging coordinate geometry. Here’s the structured solution:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Coordinates**
We place the points in a coordinate plane to simplify computations:

- Place point $ H $ at the origin: $ H = (0, 0) $
- Since $ FH = 21 $, place point $ F $ at $ (21, 0) $ (along the x-axis).
  
Now, consider the positions of $ G $ and $ J $:

- **Point $ G $** lies on line $ HF $. Since $ GH = x + 3.5 $, and the total length $ HF = 21 $, $ G $ must lie between $ H $ and $ F $, so its x-coordinate is:
  $$
  G = (x + 3.5, 0)
  $$

- **Point $ J $** lies on line $ HK $, and $ HJ = x - 8.5 $. We’ll assume $ K $ lies directly above $ H $, i.e., vertically aligned, so $ K = (0, 7) $, making line $ HK $ vertical. Thus:
  $$
  J = (0, x - 8.5)
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Use Slope Condition for Parallel Lines**

Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal. Compute the slopes of $ GJ $ and $ FK $:

#### **Slope of $ GJ $:**
$$
\text{slope}_{GJ} = \frac{y_J - y_G}{x_J - x_G} = \frac{(x - 8.5) - 0}{0 - (x + 3.5)} = \frac{x - 8.5}{-x - 3.5}
$$

#### **Slope of $ FK $:**
$$
\text{slope}_{FK} = \frac{y_K - y_F}{x_K - x_F} = \frac{7 - 0}{0 - 21} = \frac{7}{-21} = -\frac{1}{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Set Slopes Equal for Parallelism**

Equating the two slopes:
$$
\frac{x - 8.5}{-x - 3.5} = -\frac{1}{3}
$$

Multiply both sides by $-1$:
$$
\frac{x - 8.5}{x + 3.5} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
3(x - 8.5) = x + 3.5
$$

Simplify:
$$
3x - 25.5 = x + 3.5 \\
2x = 29 \\
x = 14.5
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After setting up coordinates, computing slopes, and equating them for parallelism, we find that the value of $ x $ satisfying the given geometric constraints is:

$$
\boxed{14.5}
$$

This corresponds to **Option C**.

**Final Answer: C**
