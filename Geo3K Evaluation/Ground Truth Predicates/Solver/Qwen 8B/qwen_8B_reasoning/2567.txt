MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral EFGH which is a rectangle. The question is asking for the measure of angle FGE, given that angle HGE is 13 degrees. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles.

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but here they mention angle HGE is 13 degrees. That seems conflicting because if it's a rectangle, then all angles should be 90 degrees. Maybe I need to check the constraints again.

Wait, the problem says that there are certain points lying on lines. Let me parse the given constraints:

- Point K lies on line FH (Line(F, H)) and also on line GE (Line(G, E)). Also, there's a perpendicularity condition between lines HE and HG. 

Wait, the Perpendicular(Line(H,E), Line(H,G)) means that HE is perpendicular to HG? Or maybe the lines HE and HG are perpendicular? Wait, the notation might mean that the line connecting H and E is perpendicular to the line connecting H and G. So, line HE ⊥ line HG. But if that's the case, then at point H, the two lines HE and HG form a right angle. So that would imply that angle EHG is 90 degrees. But since EFGH is supposed to be a rectangle, then angle at H should be 90 degrees. So that makes sense.

But then why is angle HGE given as 13 degrees? Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me sketch mentally. Let me label the rectangle EFGH. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are right angles. Let me consider the order of the letters. Quadrilateral EFGH – so the vertices are connected as E-F-G-H-E?

Wait, but depending on how the rectangle is labeled, the positions of the points matter. Let me think about the coordinates. Suppose I assign coordinates to make this easier. Let me assume that E is at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose EF is horizontal and EH is vertical. Wait, but given the perpendicularity between HE and HG. Let me clarify.

Let me denote the points. Let me imagine rectangle EFGH. Let me recall that in a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, no, all angles are 90 degrees. So every corner is a right angle. However, the problem mentions angle HGE, which is angle at point G between points H, G, and E. Wait, angle HGE is at point G, formed by points H, G, E. So vertex at G, with segments GH and GE.

Wait, but in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So if we look at triangle HGE, but wait, is that a triangle? Let me see. Points H, G, E. Are these three points forming a triangle? Well, in the rectangle, H is connected to G and E? Wait, in rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So the sides are connected as E to F, F to G, G to H, H to E. Therefore, point G is connected to F and H. So segment GH is one side of the rectangle, and GE would be a diagonal? Wait, unless E is connected to G. Wait, in the rectangle, E is connected to H and F. So GE is not a side of the rectangle unless... Wait, maybe the rectangle is named differently. Let me confirm.

If the quadrilateral is EFGH, then the order of the letters matters. So E connected to F, F connected to G, G connected to H, H connected to E. So the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. Then diagonals would be EG and FH. So in this case, GE is a diagonal from G to E. Similarly, HE is a side from H to E. And HG is a side from H to G. 

So, the problem states that line HE is perpendicular to line HG. Wait, HE is a side of the rectangle (from H to E) and HG is another side (from H to G). Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So HE and HG are adjacent sides meeting at H. Therefore, they should be perpendicular. Which is consistent with the fact that in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So the given condition that HE is perpendicular to HG is just reinforcing that EFGH is a rectangle. So that's redundant information, but perhaps necessary for the problem.

Now, the problem gives us that angle HGE is 13 degrees. Let me parse that. Angle HGE is at point G, between points H, G, E. So that's angle at G between H and E. So in other words, looking at triangle HGE. Wait, but in the rectangle, points H, G, E. Let me think about their positions. 

Since EFGH is a rectangle, point G is connected to F and H. Point E is connected to H and F. So, in terms of coordinates, let me assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me place point E at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose EH is along the y-axis and EF is along the x-axis. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s say E is at (0, 0).

Assume that EH is vertical. Since HE is a side of the rectangle, so H would be at (0, b) for some b > 0.

Similarly, EF is horizontal, so F would be at (a, 0) for some a > 0.

Then, since FG is the next side, from F(a,0) to G(a, b), making FG vertical. Then G is at (a, b). Then H is at (0, b). Connecting H(0,b) to E(0,0) completes the rectangle.

So in this coordinate system, the rectangle has coordinates:

E(0,0), F(a,0), G(a,b), H(0,b).

Now, angle HGE is the angle at point G between points H, G, E.

So point G is at (a,b). Point H is at (0,b). Point E is at (0,0).

Therefore, vectors from G to H and from G to E can be computed.

Vector GH is H - G = (0 - a, b - b) = (-a, 0)

Vector GE is E - G = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b)

So angle between vectors GH and GE at point G is angle HGE.

We can compute this angle using the dot product formula.

The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u • v)/(|u| |v|)

Compute u • v: (-a)(-a) + (0)(-b) = a² + 0 = a²

|u| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(a²) = a

|v| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²)

Thus,

cosθ = a² / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

So θ = arccos( a / sqrt(a² + b²) )

Alternatively, we can note that tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent. Wait, considering triangle HGE.

Looking at triangle HGE, with right triangle?

Wait, is triangle HGE a right triangle? Let's check. Points H(0,b), G(a,b), E(0,0). So HG is horizontal from (0,b) to (a,b), GE goes from (a,b) to (0,0). HE is vertical from (0,b) to (0,0). Wait, but triangle HGE is formed by points H, G, E. Let me see: HG is horizontal, GE is diagonal, and HE is vertical. So triangle HGE is not a right triangle. Unless... Hmm.

Wait, but maybe we can use coordinates to find the angle. Alternatively, since we know the coordinates, we can compute the slope of GE and the slope of GH, then compute the angle between them.

Wait, vector GH is from G to H: direction is towards left along the horizontal. Vector GE is from G to E: direction is southwest.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the tangent of angle HGE. Let me think. At point G, angle between GH and GE. 

In the coordinate system, GH is going from G(a,b) to H(0,b): direction is left along the horizontal axis. GE is going from G(a,b) to E(0,0): direction is down and left.

To find angle between GH and GE, we can think of the slopes. Let me compute the slopes of lines GH and GE.

Line GH: connects G(a,b) to H(0,b). It's a horizontal line, so slope is 0.

Line GE: connects G(a,b) to E(0,0). The slope is (0 - b)/(0 - a) = (-b)/(-a) = b/a.

So the angle between a horizontal line (slope 0) and a line with slope b/a. The angle theta between them can be found via tan(theta) = slope of GE minus slope of GH divided by (1 + product of slopes). Wait, since one slope is zero, it simplifies.

Alternatively, since one line is horizontal, the angle between them is simply the angle whose tangent is equal to the slope of GE.

Because the line GH is horizontal, so the angle between GH and GE is the same as the angle that GE makes with the horizontal. Thus, tan(theta) = rise over run for line GE. 

From point G(a,b) to E(0,0), the change in y is -b, change in x is -a. So slope is (-b)/(-a)=b/a. Therefore, the angle between GH (horizontal) and GE is such that tan(theta) = b/a. Hence, theta = arctan(b/a).

Given that angle HGE is 13 degrees, so theta = 13°, which equals arctan(b/a). Therefore, tan(13°) = b/a → b/a = tan(13°). So b = a tan(13°).

Now, the question asks for the measure of angle FGE. Let me find angle FGE. Again, angle at point G between points F, G, E. So angle FGE is the angle at G between F, G, E. So similar to before, but involving point F instead of H.

Point F is at (a,0). So vectors GF and GE. Let me compute this angle.

Again, using coordinates. Point G is at (a,b). Point F is at (a,0). So vector GF is F - G = (a - a, 0 - b) = (0, -b). Vector GE is E - G = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b).

So angle between vectors GF and GE at point G is angle FGE. Let me compute this angle.

Vectors:

GF = (0, -b)

GE = (-a, -b)

Using the dot product formula again.

Dot product of GF and GE is (0)(-a) + (-b)(-b) = 0 + b² = b²

Magnitude of GF is sqrt(0² + (-b)²) = sqrt(b²) = b

Magnitude of GE is sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, cos(theta) = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

So theta = arccos( b / sqrt(a² + b²) )

Alternatively, similar to earlier, we can relate this angle to the tangent. Let me think about the triangle involved.

At point G, angle between GF and GE. Let me consider the triangle FGE. Wait, GF is vertical downward from G to F, and GE is the diagonal to E. So maybe we can think of this as a right triangle? Not sure. Alternatively, using the relationship between a and b.

Earlier, we had that b/a = tan(13°). Therefore, b = a tan(13°). Let me substitute this into the expression for cos(theta) in angle FGE.

So, cos(theta) = b / sqrt(a² + b²) = [a tan(13°)] / sqrt(a² + a² tan²(13°)) ) = [tan(13°)] / sqrt(1 + tan²(13°)) )

Recall that 1 + tan²(x) = sec²(x), so sqrt(1 + tan²(x)) = sec(x) = 1/cos(x). Therefore,

cos(theta) = tan(13°) / [1 / cos(13°)] ] = tan(13°) * cos(13°) = sin(13°)/cos(13°) * cos(13°) = sin(13°)

Therefore, cos(theta) = sin(13°). So theta = arccos(sin(13°)).

Hmm, let me compute sin(13°). Let me remember that sin(x) = cos(90° - x). Therefore, sin(13°) = cos(77°). Therefore, arccos(cos(77°)) = 77°, assuming that 77° is within the principal value range of arccos, which is [0°, 180°]. So theta = 77°.

Therefore, angle FGE is 77 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 77. So the answer is D.

Wait, let me verify once more. Because angle FGE is theta = arccos(sin(13°)) = arccos(cos(77°))? Wait, because sin(13°) = cos(90° - 13°) = cos(77°). Yes. Therefore, arccos(cos(77°)) is 77°, so yes, theta = 77°. Therefore, the measure of angle FGE is 77 degrees, which corresponds to option D.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this without coordinates. For instance, in the rectangle, since angle HGE is 13°, and angle FGE is complementary or supplementary to something else.

Wait, in the rectangle, the diagonal GE divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles. In triangle HGE, we found that angle at G is 13°, and in triangle FGE, angle at G is what we're seeking. Since the rectangle's sides are related through the ratio a/b or b/a, leading to those trigonometric relationships.

Another approach: since in the rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but not sure if that helps directly. However, in triangle HGE and triangle FGE, both share the diagonal GE. Given that angle HGE is 13°, and knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, but maybe not directly helpful unless we can find relations between the angles.

Alternatively, since in triangle HGE, angle at G is 13°, and angle at H is 90°, because HE and HG are perpendicular. Wait, in triangle HGE, angle at H is 90°, because HE and HG are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle HGE is a right triangle with right angle at H. Therefore, angles sum to 180°, so angle at G (which is 13°) plus angle at H (90°) plus angle at E equals 180. So angle at E is 180 - 90 - 13 = 77°. Wait, but angle at E in triangle HGE is angle HEF? Wait, no, in triangle HGE, the third angle is at E, between H, E, and G. So angle at E is angle HEG. But how does that relate to angle FGE?

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between angle HGE (at G) and angle FGE (also at G). Let me think. In the rectangle, point F is connected to G. So from point G, we have two lines: GF (vertical down to F) and GE (diagonal to E). Also, from point G, we have GH (horizontal left to H). Earlier, angle between GH and GE was 13°, and we want angle between GF and GE.

Since GF is vertical down from G, and GH is horizontal left from G. So the angle between GF and GH is 90°, because in the rectangle, GF and GH are adjacent sides. Wait, GF is vertical (since FG is vertical side from F(a,0) to G(a,b)), so GF is vertical. GH is horizontal from G(a,b) to H(0,b). So GF is vertical, GH is horizontal, so the angle between GF and GH is 90°, which makes sense.

So, if we consider that angle between GH and GE is 13°, and angle between GH and GF is 90°, then the angle between GF and GE would be the difference between 90° and 13°, which is 77°. Oh! That's a simpler way to see it!

Yes! Since at point G, the lines GH and GF are perpendicular (because they are adjacent sides of the rectangle). The angle between GH and GE is 13°, so the angle between GF and GE would be 90° - 13° = 77°, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, angle FGE is 77°, so the answer is D.

That's much simpler than going through coordinates and trigonometry. Realizing that GF and GH are perpendicular allows us to subtract the given angle from 90° to get the desired angle.

So regardless of the method, the answer is 77°, which is option D.
