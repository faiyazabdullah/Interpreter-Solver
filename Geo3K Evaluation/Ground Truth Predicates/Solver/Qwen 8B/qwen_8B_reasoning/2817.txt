MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the area of triangle ABC given some side lengths and a perpendicularity condition. Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, the lengths: AB is 15 units, AC is 9 units, and BC is 12 units. Also, the lines AC and BC are perpendicular. Wait, so that means angle at point C is a right angle? Because if two sides are perpendicular, then they form a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C?

Wait, hold on. The problem says Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C)). That would mean that line AC is perpendicular to line BC. So those two lines meet at point C, right? Because line AC connects points A and C, and line BC connects points B and C. Therefore, their intersection is at point C. So yes, angle at C is between AC and BC, which are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C.

So in that case, the area of a right-angled triangle is (base * height)/2. Here, the legs would be AC and BC. Since AC is 9 and BC is 12, then area should be (9*12)/2 = 54. So that would make the area 54, which is option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to verify if these sides actually satisfy the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle. If the triangle is right-angled at C, then AB should be the hypotenuse. So AB² should equal AC² + BC².

Calculating AB²: 15² = 225. AC² + BC² = 9² + 12² = 81 + 144 = 225. Yes! That matches. So it is indeed a right-angled triangle with right angle at C. Therefore, the area is (9*12)/2 = 54. So the answer should be C.

But wait, just to ensure there isn't another way to interpret the problem. For example, could the perpendicularity be between different lines? Like, maybe line AC is perpendicular to line BC, but perhaps not meeting at point C? But no, because line AC connects A and C, and line BC connects B and C. They both meet at point C. So the right angle is definitely at C. Therefore, my previous reasoning holds.

Therefore, the area is 54. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 54. So the correct answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given triangle ABC has sides AB = 15, AC = 9, and BC = 12, with AC ⊥ BC. This confirms a right-angled triangle at point C, as the perpendicularity implies a right angle between AC and BC. 

To compute the area of a right-angled triangle, we use the formula:  
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2
$$  
Here, the legs are AC = 9 and BC = 12. Substituting:  
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 12 = 54
$$  

Additionally, verifying via the Pythagorean theorem ensures the triangle is valid:  
$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \implies 15^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 \implies 225 = 81 + 144 \implies 225 = 225
$$  

Thus, the area is confirmed to be **54**.  

Final Answer: C

\boxed{C}
