====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find h here. So, we have a triangle ABC. The problem gives me some constraints. Let me jot them down again:

- Length of line AC is equal to h. So, AC = h.
- Length of line BC is 22. So, BC = 22.
- The measure of angle at point B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees. Wait, no—the notation says MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), which I think means angle at point B between points A, B, C. So that's angle ABC, right? So angle at B is 30 degrees.
- Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). So line AB is perpendicular to line AC. That means angle at A between AB and AC is 90 degrees. Wait, but hold on—if AB is perpendicular to AC, then triangle ABC has a right angle at A?

Wait, let me confirm. If line AB is perpendicular to line AC, then they form a right angle at point A. So, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at A. Therefore, sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. But wait, but BC is given as 22. However, AC is h, so maybe we need to relate these using trigonometry?

But wait, there's also the angle at B being 30 degrees. Hmm. Let me draw this mentally. Triangle ABC with right angle at A. Then angle at B is 30 degrees. So, in such a triangle, angles would be 90° at A, 30° at B, so the remaining angle at C would be 60°, since angles sum to 180°.

So, in a right-angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, let me recall. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite those angles are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the side opposite 60° is longer leg, and hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

In our case, the right angle is at A. So, angle at B is 30°, meaning that side opposite to B is AC. Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle ABC, with right angle at A. So:

- Angle at A: 90°
- Angle at B: 30°
- Therefore, angle at C: 60°

Now, side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the opposite side is AC. Similarly, side opposite angle C (60°) is AB. And hypotenuse is BC.

Given that, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

- Hypotenuse (opposite right angle): BC = 22
- Side opposite 30° (AC): should be half the hypotenuse. Wait, because in standard terms, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, yes. For example, in a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite 30°.

Therefore, if angle B is 30°, then AC is opposite angle B, so AC = (1/2)*BC. Therefore, AC = 22 / 2 = 11. Therefore, h equals 11. Which would make answer A. But wait, let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the sides mixed up. Let me re-examine.

Let me label the triangle properly. Let me consider triangle ABC with right angle at A. So vertices A, B, C, with right angle at A. So AB and AC are the legs, BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at B is 30 degrees. So angle ABC is 30 degrees. Then, in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, angle at A is 90°, so angle at C is 60°.

The side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the opposite side is AC. So AC is opposite angle B. Therefore, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is the shorter leg. Therefore, AC is the shorter leg, BC is the hypotenuse.

Thus, AC = (BC)/2. Since BC is 22, AC = 11. Hence h = 11. So answer A.

But wait, another way to check: Using trigonometric ratios. In triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, right angle at A. So tan(angle B) = opposite over adjacent. What is opposite and adjacent for angle B?

At angle B, the opposite side is AC, and the adjacent side is AB. Therefore:

tan(30°) = AC / AB.

Also, since it's a right triangle, Pythagoras: AB² + AC² = BC².

We know BC = 22, AC = h. Let me denote AB as x.

Then tan(30°) = h / x → h = x * tan(30°).

Also, x² + h² = 22².

Substituting h = x * tan(30°):

x² + (x² * tan²(30°)) = 484

Factor x²:

x² [1 + tan²(30°)] = 484

Recall that 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ. So,

x² * sec²(30°) = 484

Which implies x² = 484 / sec²(30°) = 484 * cos²(30°)

But cos(30°) is √3/2, so cos²(30°) is 3/4.

Hence x² = 484 * (3/4) → x² = 363 → x = sqrt(363). Not sure if needed yet.

But we can find h. Since h = x * tan(30°). Let's compute tan(30°) = 1/√3.

So h = x * (1/√3) = sqrt(363)/√3 = sqrt(363/3) = sqrt(121) = 11. Oh! Because 363 divided by 3 is 121. So h = 11. So same conclusion.

Therefore, h is 11. So answer A.

But wait, why does the answer choice include options like 11√3 or others? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming which angle corresponds to which side?

Wait, let me double-check once more. Suppose angle at B is 30°, right angle at A. So, in triangle ABC, with right angle at A. So sides:

AB and AC are legs, BC is hypotenuse.

Angle at B: 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Therefore, AC = BC * sin(angle B). Wait, let's use sine.

In triangle ABC, sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse. Opposite angle B is AC. So:

sin(30°) = AC / BC → AC = BC * sin(30°) = 22 * 1/2 = 11. Exactly. So h=11. Hence answer A.

Yes, seems solid. Therefore, the answer should be A. 11.

But just to make sure, let's think about alternative interpretations. Could the perpendicularity be different? The problem states Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). So line AB is perpendicular to line AC. So they meet at point A, forming a right angle. So yes, that makes triangle ABC right-angled at A. So previous reasoning holds.

Another possible confusion: Is angle ABC the angle at B, which is between AB and BC? Wait, no. The angle ABC is at point B, formed by points A-B-C. So the angle between BA and BC. Wait, but in that case, if the triangle is right-angled at A, then angle at B is between AB and BC. Wait, but in that case, the triangle isn't right-angled at B. Wait, maybe my earlier assumption was wrong?

Hold on, perhaps I confused the position of the right angle. Let me re-express:

If lines AB and AC are perpendicular, then the angle between AB and AC is 90°, which occurs at point A. Therefore, the triangle has a right angle at A. Therefore, angle at A is 90°, and angle at B is 30°, making angle at C equal to 60°, as before.

But if the angle at B is 30°, then the sides are as discussed. So AC is opposite angle B, which is 30°, so AC = BC * sin(30°) = 22*(1/2)=11. So h=11. So answer A.

Alternatively, could the problem have meant something else? Like, maybe the angle at C? No, the question says MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), which is angle at B. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle ABC is at B.

Therefore, the answer is A. 11.

But looking back at the answer choices, option A is 11. So answer A. So I think that's correct. Unless I messed up the triangle orientation.

Wait, another approach: Coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to verify.

Let’s place point A at origin (0,0). Since AB and AC are perpendicular, let's take AB along x-axis and AC along y-axis.

So point A is (0,0). Let’s say AB is along x-axis, so point B is (b, 0) for some b>0. Point C is (0, c) for some c>0. Then AC has length c = h. BC connects (b,0) to (0,c). The length BC is sqrt(b² + c²) = 22. Given that angle at B is 30 degrees. Let's calculate angle at B.

Vector BA is from B to A: (-b, 0). Vector BC is from B to C: (-b, c). The angle at B is between BA and BC. Let's compute the angle between vectors BA and BC.

Using dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (BA • BC) / (|BA| |BC|)

BA • BC = (-b)(-b) + (0)(c) = b².

|BA| = sqrt((-b)^2 + 0^2) = b.

|BC| = sqrt( (-b)^2 + c^2 ) = sqrt(b² + c²) = 22.

So cos(theta) = b² / (b * 22) ) = b / 22.

We are told theta is 30 degrees. Therefore:

cos(30°) = b / 22 → b = 22 * cos(30°) = 22*(√3/2) = 11√3.

So b = 11√3.

Now, since BC squared is b² + c² = 22².

We can compute c:

From above, b² + c² = 22² → c² = 22² - b² = 484 - (11√3)^2 = 484 - 121*3 = 484 - 363 = 121.

Therefore, c = sqrt(121) = 11. Thus, c = h = 11. So indeed, h=11. So answer A. This confirms the previous results.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 11.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ h $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are given the following constraints:

- $ \text{Length}(AC) = h $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 22 $
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- $ \text{Line}(AB) \perp \text{Line}(AC) $

This tells us that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a right angle at point $ A $. So:

- $ \angle A = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $ (since the sum of angles in a triangle is $ 180^\circ $)

This forms a classic **30–60–90 triangle**, whose side lengths follow a fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Shorter leg} : \text{Longer leg} : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine Which Side Corresponds to $ h $**

Since $ \angle B = 30^\circ $, the side **opposite** angle $ B $ will be the **shorter leg** of the triangle. 

In triangle $ ABC $, the side opposite angle $ B $ is $ AC $, which is given as $ h $. So:

$$
h = \text{Shorter leg}
$$

And the hypotenuse $ BC $ is given as 22. From the 30–60–90 triangle property:

$$
\text{Shorter leg} = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{2}
$$

$$
h = \frac{22}{2} = 11
$$

---

### **Step 3: Confirm via Trigonometry**

We can verify this using basic trigonometric relationships. In triangle $ ABC $:

- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle A = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $

Apply the definition of sine in triangle $ ABC $:

$$
\sin(\angle B) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{AC}{BC}
$$

$$
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{h}{22} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} = \frac{h}{22} \Rightarrow h = 11
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Both the geometric properties of a 30–60–90 triangle and direct trigonometric computation lead us to conclude that:

$$
h = 11
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
