MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D all lying on a circle centered at point A with radius radius_0_0. Wait, hold on—if the circle is centered at A, then points B, C, D are all on that circle. That means AB = AC = AD because they're radii of the same circle. So triangle ABC, ABD, ACD—all those triangles are isosceles? Or maybe even equilateral if all sides are equal, but since angles are given as 218 degrees, which seems like a reflex angle, so maybe not.

Wait, the first constraint says MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)) is 218 degrees. Let me parse that. The angle at point A between points D and C. So angle DAC is 218 degrees? But wait, angles in a triangle can't be more than 180 degrees unless it's a reflex angle. However, in standard geometry problems, unless specified otherwise, angles are considered as non-reflex. Hmm, but maybe here they allow reflex angles. So angle at A between D and C is 218 degrees. Then another angle, MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)) equals MeasureOf(Angle 1). So angle at point B between D and C is equal to angle 1. Need to find measure of angle 1.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points B, C, D are on a circle centered at A. So AB=AC=AD=r. So triangle ABD, ABC, ACD are all isosceles. Let me think about the positions. Since points B, C, D are on the circle around A, their distances from A are equal. Now, angle at A between D and C is 218 degrees. Since angles around a point sum up to 360 degrees, the total angle around point A would be 360 degrees. If angle DAC is 218 degrees, then the remaining angles around A would be 360-218=142 degrees. But how does that relate to other points?

Wait, maybe I should consider the arcs. Because when you have points on a circle, the central angles correspond to the arcs. For example, the arc DC would correspond to the central angle ∠DAC, which is 218 degrees. But wait, central angles are typically less than or equal to 180 degrees if considering minor arcs, but here it's 218, which is a major arc. So the arc DC is 218 degrees, meaning the rest of the circle (the minor arc) would be 360-218=142 degrees. 

But then, how do the other points come into play? Points B, C, D are on the circle. So perhaps there's some relationship between the arcs BC, BD, etc., based on the angles given. Also, angle at B between D and C—so angle DBC. Wait, angle at point B between points D and C. So angle DBC. How is that related to arcs?

In circle theorems, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But angle DBC is not necessarily an inscribed angle unless it's subtended by an arc. Wait, angle at B, so vertex at B, with segments BD and BC. So the angle between BD and BC. So that angle intercepts arc DC. Wait, no. If you have an inscribed angle at point B, intercepting arc DC. Wait, but depending on where B is located.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines or something else. Let me think again. Since all points B, C, D lie on a circle centered at A, then AB=AC=AD. Therefore, triangle ABD is isosceles with AB=AD. Similarly for others. So for instance, in triangle ABD, AB=AD, so base angles at B and D are equal. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Wait, but angle at A is 218 degrees for angle DAC. Let me visualize point A as the center of the circle. Points D and C are on the circumference, so angle at A between them is 218 degrees. Then, the arc DC measures 218 degrees. Now, if we look at angle DBC. Point B is also on the circle. So angle DBC is formed by chords BD and BC. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle DBC would be half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, when dealing with angles formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference. Wait, actually, angle DBC intercepts arc DC. But since the central angle over arc DC is 218 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be half that. Wait, but inscribed angle would be half the measure of the arc it intercepts. But if the arc is greater than 180 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be half the measure of the arc, but since the angle is inside the circle, maybe it depends on the position.

Wait, suppose arc DC is 218 degrees. Then the inscribed angle that intercepts arc DC would be half of 218, which is 109 degrees. But angle DBC could be that. Wait, but only if point B is positioned such that the angle is indeed subtending arc DC. However, since B is another point on the circle, depending on where B is located relative to D and C, the angle might be subtending the opposite arc. Wait, for instance, if B is on the opposite side of the circle from arc DC, then the angle DBC would intercept the arc DC, but if it's on the same side, maybe intercepting the other arc.

But since the entire circle is 360 degrees, and arc DC is 218 degrees, the remaining arc (the minor arc) would be 360 - 218 = 142 degrees. So if point B is on the minor arc DC, then angle DBC would intercept the major arc DC (which is 218), but if point B is on the opposite side, then it would intercept the minor arc DC (142 degrees).

But how do we determine where B is located? Well, the problem gives that point B is on the circle. There isn't much information except that angle at B (angle DBC) is equal to angle 1, which we need to find. So if we assume that angle DBC intercepts the arc DC that's 218 degrees, then angle DBC would be half of that, which is 109 degrees. Alternatively, if it intercepts the minor arc DC (142 degrees), then it would be half of that, 71 degrees. However, 109 is one of the answer choices (option C). But why would angle DBC intercept the major arc?

Wait, let's recall the exact formula. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, the intercepted arc depends on the location of the point. If the angle is formed outside the arc, then it's different. Wait, but in this case, point B is on the circle. So angle DBC is an inscribed angle. The intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite to the angle. So if you have points D, B, C on the circle, then angle at B intercepts arc DC. Depending on which arc, the major or minor arc. So if the arc DC is 218 degrees (major arc), then the inscribed angle would be half of that. But if point B is located such that when you connect BD and BC, the angle is subtended by the major arc DC. But how can we tell?

Alternatively, since points D and C are fixed with a central angle of 218 degrees, then the arc DC is 218 degrees. Now, if B is somewhere else on the circle, then the position of B affects whether angle DBC intercepts the major or minor arc. But without knowing where B is, how can we determine?

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Let me think about triangle DBC. Wait, but we don't have information about triangle DBC. Alternatively, since all points are on the circle centered at A, maybe we can use coordinates or vectors.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Suppose point A is at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to points B, C, D on the circle centered at A with radius r. Let me choose specific values for simplicity. Let’s say the radius is 1 unit. Let me place point C at (1,0). Then point D is located such that the central angle between D and C is 218 degrees. So starting from point C at angle 0 degrees, moving 218 degrees counterclockwise would place point D. But 218 degrees is more than 180, so it's in the third quadrant. Coordinates of D would be (cos(218°), sin(218°)). But maybe it's easier to work with radians, but let's stick to degrees for intuition.

Now, point B is also on the circle. Where is B? We don't have direct info, but maybe we can find relations based on angle DBC being equal to angle 1. But without knowing where B is, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps there's another relation.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(D, B, C) which is angle DBC. So, in triangle DBC, angle at B. Maybe applying the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle DBC. But for that, we need lengths.

Since AB = AC = AD = r. Let me denote AB = AC = AD = 1 for simplicity.

So, in triangle ADC, we have AD = AC = 1, angle at A is 218 degrees. Using the Law of Cosines to find DC:

DC² = AD² + AC² - 2 * AD * AC * cos(angle DAC)

So DC² = 1 + 1 - 2*1*1*cos(218°) = 2 - 2cos(218°)

Compute cos(218°): 218° is in the third quadrant, reference angle 218 - 180 = 38°, so cos(218°) = -cos(38°) ≈ -0.7880.

Thus DC² ≈ 2 - 2*(-0.7880) = 2 + 1.576 ≈ 3.576 → DC ≈ sqrt(3.576) ≈ 1.891.

Similarly, in triangle DBC, we need to find angle at B. To apply Law of Cosines or Law of Sines, we need more sides. But we might need to relate the sides through other triangles.

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, perhaps using the fact that AB = AC = AD = 1, and trying to find relations between triangles involving B.

Wait, but we don't know the position of B. Unless there's a way to relate it via the other angles. Wait, the problem states that angle DBC equals angle 1, which we need to find. So if we can express angle DBC in terms of known quantities, maybe we can find its measure.

Another idea: In triangle DBC, the angle at B is angle DBC. The sides BD and BC can be expressed in terms of the chord lengths. Since BD and BC are chords of the circle with central angles corresponding to arcs BD and BC.

But we need to find those central angles. However, without knowing where B is, this seems difficult. But maybe there's a way to relate these angles through the given data.

Alternatively, since points B, C, D are on the circle centered at A, then AB = AC = AD = r. So triangle ABD has AB = AD, making it isosceles. Similarly for triangle ABC and ACD. Wait, but angle at A for triangle ABD is... Well, if we can find the central angles between each pair of points.

But we only know the central angle between D and C is 218 degrees. What about the others? Not sure yet.

Wait, but angle DBC is an inscribed angle. As per earlier thoughts, if the arc DC is 218 degrees, then angle DBC would be half of that if it's subtended by arc DC. But angle DBC is formed by points D-B-C. So, the intercepted arc would be arc DC that does not contain B. So if B is on the opposite side of the circle from arc DC, then the angle DBC would intercept arc DC (the major arc of 218 degrees). Thus, the measure of angle DBC would be half of 218°, which is 109°. Which matches option C.

Therefore, the measure of angle 1 is 109 degrees, so the answer is C.

But wait, let me verify. If the intercepted arc is the major arc DC (218 degrees), then yes, the inscribed angle would be half of that. However, if the intercepted arc were the minor arc DC (which would be 360 - 218 = 142 degrees), then angle DBC would be half of that, which is 71 degrees. But since 71 isn't an option, but 109 is, and the question mentions angle 1, which is likely referring to the larger arc. But why?

Because if B is located such that when you form angle DBC, the arc it intercepts is the major arc DC. Since the central angle between D and C is 218 degrees, placing B on the opposite side of the circle would make the angle DBC intercept the major arc. Hence, angle DBC = 218 / 2 = 109 degrees.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be C. 109 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying fundamental circle theorems.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**
We are told that points $ A, B, C, D $ all lie on a **circle centered at point $ A $** with radius $ r $. This implies that:
$$
AB = AC = AD = r
$$
This makes triangles $ ABD $, $ ABC $, and $ ACD $ all **isosceles**, since they share two equal sides ($ AB = AD $, $ AB = AC $, $ AC = AD $ respectively).

We are specifically told:
- $ \angle DAC = 218^\circ $
- $ \angle DBC = \angle 1 $

Our goal is to compute the value of $ \angle 1 $.

---

### **Step 2: Central and Inscribed Angles**
The key insight comes from understanding the relationship between **central angles** and **inscribed angles**.

- The angle $ \angle DAC $ is a **central angle** subtending arc $ DC $, and thus:
  $$
  \text{Measure of arc } DC = 218^\circ
  $$

- An **inscribed angle** subtending the **same arc** will be **half the measure of the central angle**:
  $$
  \angle DBC = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{arc } DC) = \frac{1}{2} \times 218^\circ = 109^\circ
  $$

This applies because:
- Point $ B $ lies on the **circumference** of the circle,
- $ \angle DBC $ is an **inscribed angle** subtending arc $ DC $,
- The **intercepted arc** is the **major arc** $ DC $, which measures $ 218^\circ $,
- Therefore, the inscribed angle $ \angle DBC $ is half of this, i.e., $ 109^\circ $.

---

### **Conclusion**

From the above reasoning, we conclude that:
$$
\angle 1 = 109^\circ
$$

---
