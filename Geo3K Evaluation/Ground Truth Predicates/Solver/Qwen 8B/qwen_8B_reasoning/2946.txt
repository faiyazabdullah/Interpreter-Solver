MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a kite named FGJH, right? Wait, kites have specific properties. Let me recall. A kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. Also, the angles between the unequal sides are called vertex angles, and they're usually not equal. The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and one of them is an axis of symmetry. 

The problem gives some angle measures and side lengths. Let me note down the given information:

First, Angle at H (Angle HGF?) Wait, the notation might be tricky. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H, G, F)), 128). So, Angle HGF? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So, angle at G between points H, G, F. So, ∠HGF = 128 degrees. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, J, H)), 72), so angle at J between F, J, H. That would be ∠FJH = 72 degrees. 

Also, the sides: LengthOf(Line(G, F)) equals LengthOf(Line(H, G)). So, GF = HG. And LengthOf(Line(H, J)) equals LengthOf(Line(J, F)). So, HJ = JF. 

So, since it's a kite, which sides are equal? In a kite, there are two pairs of adjacent sides. If GF = HG and HJ = JF, then maybe the vertices are arranged such that the pairs are GF=HG and HJ=JF. But I need to visualize the kite. Let me sketch mentally.

Let me think about the order of the letters: F, G, H, J. Wait, the kite is FGHJ? Or is it FGJH? The question says "F G H J is a kite". So the vertices are F, G, H, J connected in order? Wait, but kites are typically quadrilaterals with four sides, so maybe the order is important here. Let me confirm the structure.

In a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. Suppose the kite is named as F-G-H-J-F. So, the sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF. Given that GF = HG (so FG = HG) and HJ = JF. Therefore, FG = HG and HJ = JF. So, the two pairs of adjacent sides are FG & HG, and HJ & JF. So, that makes sense for a kite. So, the kite has sides FG=HG and HJ=JF. Therefore, the vertices are ordered such that adjacent sides are equal. 

Now, the angles given are ∠HGF = 128°, which is angle at G between H and F. So, in triangle HGF? Wait, no, because it's part of the kite. Let me try to imagine the kite. Let me consider point G connected to F and H. Since FG = HG, triangle FGH is isoceles with FG = HG. Therefore, angles opposite those sides should be equal. Wait, but ∠HGF is at G, so in triangle FGH, the base would be FH, and legs FG and HG. Therefore, the base angles at F and H would be equal. Wait, but ∠HGF is at G, which is the vertex angle of the isoceles triangle FGH. Wait, no. If FG = HG, then the base is FH, and the two equal sides are FG and HG. Therefore, the base angles are at F and H. Wait, but ∠HGF is at G. So that's the vertex angle of the isoceles triangle FGH. Therefore, in triangle FGH, angles at F and H are equal. 

But wait, the measure of angle at G (∠HGF) is 128°, so that's the vertex angle. Then the sum of angles in triangle FGH would be 180°, so the two base angles at F and H would each be (180-128)/2 = 52/2 = 26°? Wait, that seems small, but okay. However, these angles are parts of the kite. Now, also, there's another angle given: ∠FJH = 72°, which is angle at J between F and H. So, that's angle at J, between points F, J, H. So, in triangle FJH? But since HJ = JF, triangle FJH is also isoceles with HJ = JF, making the base angles at F and H equal. Wait, but ∠FJH is at J, so that's the vertex angle. Therefore, the base angles at F and H would be equal. Let me compute them. 

Wait, but first, let's make sure about the structure. Since the kite is FGHJ, with sides FG = HG and HJ = JF. So, the kite has two pairs of adjacent equal sides. Therefore, the vertices are arranged so that FG and GH are one pair, and HJ and JF are the other pair. Therefore, the diagonals would connect F to H and G to J. 

But perhaps I need to use the properties of kites. One key property is that the diagonals are perpendicular. Another is that one diagonal bisects the vertex angles. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360°, but I don't know all angles yet. 

But the question asks for the measure of angle GFJ. Wait, angle GFJ is the angle at point F between points G, F, J. So, ∠GFJ. So, that's the angle at F between segments FG and FJ. 

To find this angle, perhaps we can look at triangle GFJ. Wait, but do we know anything about triangle GFJ? Let's see. We know that HJ = JF, so JF is equal to HJ. Also, FG = HG. Maybe we can relate angles through triangles. 

Alternatively, since it's a kite, maybe we can use the properties of the angles. For example, in a kite, one pair of opposite angles are equal. Which ones? The angles between the unequal sides. Wait, in a kite, the angles between the pairs of equal sides are called the vertex angles, and they are not necessarily equal. Wait, actually, in a kite, only one pair of opposite angles are congruent. Those are the angles between the unequal sides. Wait, let me check. 

Suppose a kite has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides equal. Let’s say AB and AD are one pair, BC and CD are another. Then, the angles at A and C are the ones between the unequal sides. Wait, no. Wait, depending on how the sides are arranged. Maybe the angles between the unequal sides are the ones that are equal. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the given data. 

We have angle at G (∠HGF) = 128°, which is part of triangle FGH. Earlier, I thought that in triangle FGH, angles at F and H are 26° each. But let me verify again. 

In triangle FGH, FG = HG, so it's an isoceles triangle with base FH. Therefore, the base angles are ∠FGH (at G) is the vertex angle, and the base angles are at F and H. Wait, no. Wait, the vertex angle is at the apex of the isoceles triangle. If FG = HG, then the apex is at G. Therefore, the base is FH, and the two equal sides are FG and HG. Therefore, the base angles are at F and H. Therefore, the angles at F and H in triangle FGH are equal. 

Given that ∠HGF is at G, which is 128°, so the sum of angles in triangle FGH is 180°, so angles at F and H are (180 - 128)/2 = 52 / 2 = 26°. Therefore, ∠GFH = 26° and ∠G HF = 26°? Wait, ∠GFH is the angle at F between G and H. Wait, but in the kite, point F is connected to G and J. So, angle at F is split into two parts: one part is ∠GFH (from triangle FGH) which is 26°, and another part is ∠JFG (since the kite has another side FJ). Wait, but how does that fit?

Wait, the total angle at point F in the kite is composed of two angles: ∠GFH (which is part of triangle FGH) and ∠JFG. Wait, but maybe I need to consider that. Let me think. 

Point F is connected to G and J. Also, point F is connected to H via the side FH? No, wait, the kite is F-G-H-J-F. So, the sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF. So, at point F, the sides are FG and JF. Therefore, the angle at F is between FG and JF, which is ∠GFJ, which is what we need to find. 

However, earlier, in triangle FGH, we had angle at F being ∠GFH = 26°, which is between points G, F, H. So, that's part of the angle at F. But the full angle at F is between FG and FJ. Therefore, maybe ∠GFH is adjacent to ∠JFH? Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire structure. 

Wait, let me draw this mentally. Let's assume that the kite is made up of two triangles: FGH and FJH. Wait, but HJ = JF, so triangle FJH is isoceles with HJ = JF. Therefore, in triangle FJH, the base is FH, and the two equal sides are HJ and JF. Therefore, the base angles at F and H are equal. The given angle at J is ∠FJH = 72°, which is the vertex angle of triangle FJH. Therefore, the base angles at F and H would be (180 - 72)/2 = 108/2 = 54°. So, ∠JFH = 54° and ∠JHF = 54°. 

Wait, but in triangle FJH, angle at F is ∠JFH = 54°, which is part of the angle at F in the kite. Earlier, from triangle FGH, we had ∠GFH = 26°, which is the angle between FG and FH. Therefore, combining both parts, the total angle at F (∠GFJ) is ∠GFH + ∠JFH? Wait, no. Wait, if you have point F connected to G, H, and J. Wait, in the kite, point F is connected to G and J. But in triangle FGH, the angle at F is between FG and FH. But FH is a diagonal, not a side of the kite. Therefore, perhaps the angle at F in the kite is between FG and FJ, which is ∠GFJ, and FH splits that angle into two parts: ∠GFH (from triangle FGH) and ∠JFH (from triangle FJH). 

Therefore, the total angle at F would be ∠GFH + ∠JFH = 26° + 54° = 80°, which would be ∠GFJ. Therefore, the measure of angle GFJ is 80°, which would correspond to option B. 

Wait, let me check again. 

From triangle FGH: angle at F is ∠GFH = 26°, from triangle FJH: angle at F is ∠JFH = 54°, so adding them together gives 26 + 54 = 80°, which is the total angle at F, which is ∠GFJ. Hence, the answer is 80°, which is option B. 

But let me verify once more. 

Another approach: in the kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me try to use coordinates to model this. Let me place point G at origin (0,0). Since FG = HG, suppose FG = HG = x. Let me assign coordinates. Let me take point G at (0,0). Let me assume that FG is along the x-axis. So, point F could be at (a, 0). Since FG = HG, then point H is somewhere such that distance from G(0,0) to H is same as FG. Let me assume that FG is horizontal. Let me define coordinates carefully. 

Let me set coordinate system: Let’s put point G at (0,0). Let me let FG be along positive x-axis. Let me assume FG = HG = 1 unit for simplicity. Let me let point F be at (1,0). Then, point H is somewhere such that distance from G(0,0) to H is 1. Let me assume that H is located at (cos θ, sin θ), so that GH = 1. Then, angle at G (∠HGF) is given as 128°, which is the angle between vectors GH and GF. Vector GF is from G to F: (1,0). Vector GH is from G to H: (cos θ, sin θ). The angle between these vectors is 128°, so the cosine of the angle between them is cos(128°) = dot product of vectors divided by their magnitudes. Since both vectors have magnitude 1, the dot product is cos(128°). The dot product is also (1)(cos θ) + (0)(sin θ) = cos θ. Therefore, cos θ = cos(128°), so θ = 128° or θ = -128°, but since angle is measured from positive x-axis, θ would be 128°, meaning point H is at (cos 128°, sin 128°). 

So coordinates:

G = (0, 0)

F = (1, 0)

H = (cos 128°, sin 128°)

Now, need to find coordinates of J such that HJ = JF. Also, since it's a kite, the other pair of sides is HJ = JF. So, J lies somewhere such that it is equidistant from H and F. Therefore, J lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment HF. 

First, let me find coordinates of H and F. Coordinates of F is (1, 0). Coordinates of H are (cos 128°, sin 128°). Let me calculate approximate values for clarity. 

128° is in second quadrant. Cos 128° ≈ cos(180°−52°) = -cos 52° ≈ -0.6157. Sin 128° ≈ sin(52°) ≈ 0.7880. So approximately, H is at (-0.6157, 0.7880).

Midpoint of HF: midpoint M_x = (1 + (-0.6157))/2 ≈ (0.3843)/2 ≈ 0.19215. Midpoint M_y = (0 + 0.7880)/2 ≈ 0.394. 

The line HF goes from F(1, 0) to H(-0.6157, 0.7880). The slope of HF is (0.7880 - 0)/(-0.6157 - 1) = 0.7880 / (-1.6157) ≈ -0.4878. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 1/0.4878 ≈ 2.05. 

Equation of perpendicular bisector: passing through midpoint M(≈0.19215, ≈0.394) with slope ≈2.05. 

Parametric equations for J: since J lies on this perpendicular bisector. But also, since the kite is FGHJ, after connecting H to J to F, we need to ensure that the shape closes properly. However, without knowing exact positions, maybe we can proceed with angles. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the given angle ∠FJH = 72°. At point J, angle between F and H is 72°. 

But maybe this is getting too complex. Alternatively, going back to previous reasoning: 

Earlier conclusion was that angle at F is 80°, so answer is B. But let me check if there are contradictions. 

In triangle FGH, angle at F is 26°, triangle FJH has angle at F of 54°, adding to 80°. 

But another way: the sum of all interior angles of the kite (quadrilateral) is 360°. Let me try to compute all angles. 

We have angle at G: 128°, angle at J: 72°, and we need angles at F and H. 

Wait, but in a kite, one pair of opposite angles are equal. Which ones? The ones between the unequal sides. 

Assuming that the kite has angles at G and H as one pair, and angles at F and J as another? Not sure. Wait, in our case, we have angle at G is 128°, angle at J is 72°, so if they are the ones between unequal sides, then they are not equal. Therefore, the other two angles (at F and H) should be equal. 

So, sum of angles: 128 + 72 + 2x = 360 → 128+72=200, so 2x=160 → x=80. Therefore, angles at F and H are each 80°. Wait, but earlier calculation said angle at F is 80°, which matches. Therefore, angle at F is 80°, which is ∠GFJ. Hence, answer is B. 

Yes! This confirms it. So the measure of ∠GFJ is 80°, which is option B. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle GFJ $ in the kite $ FGJH $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Kite**
A kite is defined as a quadrilateral with **two pairs of adjacent sides of equal length**. From the problem:

- $ FG = HG $
- $ HJ = JF $

This means the kite is structured such that:
- Sides $ FG $ and $ HG $ form one pair,
- Sides $ HJ $ and $ JF $ form the other pair.

These equal sides imply that the kite consists of two triangles:
- Triangle $ FGH $, where $ FG = HG $,
- Triangle $ FJH $, where $ HJ = JF $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Given Angles**

#### **(i) Triangle $ FGH $: Isosceles Triangle**
- $ FG = HG \Rightarrow \triangle FGH $ is isosceles with base $ FH $.
- Given: $ \angle HGF = 128^\circ $ — this is the **vertex angle** of the isosceles triangle.
- Sum of angles in a triangle:  
  $$
  \angle HGF + \angle GFH + \angle G HF = 180^\circ
  $$
  Since $ FG = HG $, the base angles $ \angle GFH $ and $ \angle G HF $ are equal.

Thus:
$$
\angle GFH = \angle G HF = \frac{180^\circ - 128^\circ}{2} = \frac{52^\circ}{2} = 26^\circ
$$

---

#### **(ii) Triangle $ FJH $: Isosceles Triangle**
- $ HJ = JF \Rightarrow \triangle FJH $ is isosceles with base $ FH $.
- Given: $ \angle FJH = 72^\circ $ — this is the **vertex angle** of the isosceles triangle.
- Again, the base angles $ \angle JFH $ and $ \angle J HF $ are equal.

So:
$$
\angle JFH = \angle J HF = \frac{180^\circ - 72^\circ}{2} = \frac{108^\circ}{2} = 54^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine $ \angle GFJ $**

At vertex $ F $, the angle $ \angle GFJ $ is formed between the sides $ FG $ and $ FJ $. This angle includes two parts:
- $ \angle GFH = 26^\circ $ (from triangle $ FGH $),
- $ \angle JFH = 54^\circ $ (from triangle $ FJH $),

Adding these gives:
$$
\angle GFJ = \angle GFH + \angle JFH = 26^\circ + 54^\circ = 80^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final Verification Using Quadrilateral Angle Sum**

As a final check, summing all internal angles of the kite:
- $ \angle HGF = 128^\circ $
- $ \angle FJH = 72^\circ $
- $ \angle GFJ = 80^\circ $
- Remaining angle at $ H $: As shown earlier, due to symmetry, it is also $ 80^\circ $

Sum:  
$$
128^\circ + 72^\circ + 80^\circ + 80^\circ = 360^\circ
$$
Which confirms consistency.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

Final Answer: B
