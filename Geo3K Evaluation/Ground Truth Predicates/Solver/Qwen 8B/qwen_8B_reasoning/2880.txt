<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the setup based on the given constraints. Let me go through each condition step by step.

So, we have several points: M, K, J, L, N, and P. The main circle here is centered at point P with radius 2.0 units. So, all these points M, K, J, L, N lie on this circle because they satisfy PointLiesOnCircle with center P and radius 2.0. That means PM = PK = PJ = PL = PN = 2.0, since they're radii of the circle.

Now, there are some lines mentioned. First, PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(M, K)) – so point P lies on the line connecting M and K? Wait, that might mean that P is somewhere along the line MK. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(J, L)) implies P is on line JL. But since all those points (M, K, J, L, N) are on the circle centered at P, how can P lie on those lines?

Wait a second, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The first constraint says PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(M, K)). So that would mean that point P is on the line formed by points M and K. Similarly for the others. So, point P is lying on both lines MK and JL. Therefore, lines MK and JL intersect at point P. Also, since P is the center of the circle, but the points M, K, J, L, N are on the circumference. Wait, but if P is the center, then lines like MK would pass through the center. Because if two points on a circle are connected, their line passes through the center only if they are diametrically opposite. Wait, no. If the line passes through the center, then it's a diameter. But if P is the center, then the line MK passing through P would make MK a diameter. Similarly for JL passing through P.

But hold on, the circle is centered at P. So if points M and K are on the circle, then the line MK passes through P. Which would imply that P is the midpoint of MK, making MK a diameter. Similarly for line JL passing through P, meaning J and L are endpoints of another diameter. Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: Perpendicular(Line(P, N), Line(P, J)). So line PN is perpendicular to line PJ. Since P is the center, PN and PJ are radii. Wait, but if PN is perpendicular to PJ, then angle between them is 90 degrees. So angle NPJ is 90 degrees. But since PN and PJ are radii, triangle NPJ would be a right-angled triangle at P. Wait, but since N and J are points on the circle, PN and PJ are both radii, so they have the same length. Then triangle NPJ would have legs of equal length, making it an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, the hypotenuse NJ would be PN√2. But maybe that's not directly useful yet.

The question asks for the measure of arc NJK. Wait, the notation m∠MP L = 65 degrees, and NP ⊥ PL. Wait, let me parse the question again:

"In ∘P, m∠MP L = 65° and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJ K."

Wait, actually, the original question says "Find m∠NJK". Wait, no, looking back: "Find m∠NJ K." Wait, maybe it's the measure of arc NJK? Or maybe the angle? Wait, the original question says "m∠NJ K", which is angle N-J-K. Wait, but maybe the arc measure. Wait, the problem mentions "m∠MP L = 65", which is an angle at P. Maybe the question is about the measure of arc NJK. But the way it's written is m∠NJ K. Wait, perhaps there was a typo? Alternatively, maybe it's referring to arc N to J to K? Or maybe it's the measure of the arc subtended by points N, J, K?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of arc NK, but written as NJK. Wait, let me check the exact wording again: "Find m∠NJ K." Wait, that would be angle N-J-K, which is an inscribed angle. But depending on where points N, J, K are located. However, since all these points are on the circle centered at P, maybe angle NJK is an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle NJK would be at point J, with segments JN and JK. But since J is on the circle, and N and K are also on the circle. So angle NJK would intercept arc NK. The measure of that angle would be half the measure of arc NK. But we need more information.

But let me recap the given data:

Given that:

- Points M, K, J, L, N are on circle with center P (radius 2).

- Lines MK and JL pass through P (since P lies on those lines). Therefore, MK and JL are diameters of the circle. Hence, MK and JL are straight lines passing through the center P, so they are diameters.

Also, PN is perpendicular to PL. So, vector PN is perpendicular to vector PL. Since both PN and PL are radii of the circle, so PN and PL are two radii forming a right angle at P. Therefore, angle NPL is 90 degrees.

Additionally, angle MPL is given as 65 degrees. Wait, angle at P between points M and L? Let me think. The angle ∠MPL is at point P, between points M and L. So, that would be the angle between PM and PL. Given that PM is a radius, and PL is another radius. Since we know that PN is perpendicular to PL, and angle NPL is 90 degrees.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me imagine circle with center P. Let me consider coordinates for simplicity. Suppose P is at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to various points.

Since MK is a diameter, suppose that line MK is horizontal. Let me assume that point M is at (-a, 0) and K is at (a, 0), so that the line MK passes through P(0,0). Similarly, line JL is another diameter. Let me assume that line JL is vertical for simplicity. Let me say point J is at (0, b) and L is at (0, -b), so line JL passes through P(0,0). Now, the condition that PN is perpendicular to PL. Wait, PL is the segment from P(0,0) to L(0,-b), which is pointing downward along the y-axis. So PN should be perpendicular to PL. Since PL is along negative y-axis, PN should be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Wait, but PN is a radius. So point N is somewhere on the circle such that PN is perpendicular to PL. Since PL is along the negative y-axis, direction of PL is down. So PN should be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Let me pick positive x-axis direction. So PN is along positive x-axis. Therefore, point N would be at (c, 0), but wait, but MK is already along the x-axis with points M(-a, 0) and K(a, 0). So if PN is along x-axis, then point N could be either M or K? But N is another point on the circle. Wait, unless N is different from M and K. Wait, but in our current setup, the points on the circle are M, K, J, L, N. So N is another point. So if PN is along positive x-axis, then N would be at (r, 0), where r is radius. Wait, but if MK is a diameter, then the radius is half of MK. So if MK has length 2r, then radius is r. Wait, but earlier, the circle has radius 2.0. So radius is 2.0. Therefore, points M and K are separated by 4 units (diameter). So if I set up coordinates with P at (0,0), then M could be (-2, 0), K at (2, 0). Then line MK is the x-axis. Then line JL is another diameter; let's say J is (0, 2) and L is (0, -2). Now, PN is perpendicular to PL. Vector PL is from P(0,0) to L(0,-2), which is direction (0,-1). So PN should be perpendicular to that. Therefore, PN should be in direction (1,0) or (-1,0). So point N is at (2,0) or (-2,0). But those are points M and K. But N is another distinct point. Wait, but maybe my assumption that JL is vertical is conflicting with PN being along x-axis. Unless N is at (something else). Wait, maybe I made wrong assumptions here.

Alternatively, since PN is perpendicular to PL, and PL is part of the diameter JL. So if PL is a radius, then PN is another radius perpendicular to PL. So angle between PL and PN is 90 degrees. Since PL is a radius, and PN is another radius, so angle between them is 90 degrees. So in terms of central angles, the arc from L to N would be 90 degrees. Therefore, arc LN measures 90 degrees. 

Also, angle MPL is given as 65 degrees. Let's think about that. Angle at P between points M and L. So, angle between PM and PL. Since PM is a radius, and PL is another radius. So the central angle between points M and L is 65 degrees. Therefore, the arc ML measures 65 degrees. 

Now, the question is to find the measure of angle NJK. Wait, angle at J between points N, J, K. So ∠NJK. To find that angle, we can use the fact that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But ∠NJK is an inscribed angle intercepting arc NK. Wait, but let me confirm. In triangle NJK, angle at J intercepts arc NK. So the measure of ∠NJK is half the measure of arc NK. So if I can find the measure of arc NK, then divide by 2 to get the angle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me see.

First, let's note that we have several arcs. We know arc ML is 65 degrees. Also, arc LN is 90 degrees, because PN is perpendicular to PL, implying that the central angle between L and N is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc LN = 90 degrees. So starting from L, moving 90 degrees to N. 

But we need to figure out the position of points relative to each other. Let me try to arrange the points around the circle. Let's start by considering the central angles between various points.

Assume the circle is divided into arcs by points M, K, J, L, N. Let me try to map their positions.

We know:

- Arc ML = 65 degrees (central angle between M and L)
- Arc LN = 90 degrees (central angle between L and N)

But we need to relate these to other arcs. Also, since J and L are endpoints of a diameter (because line JL passes through P), so arc JL is 180 degrees. Therefore, the central angle between J and L is 180 degrees. So if we can find the positions of J and other points, we can compute the necessary arcs.

Let me try to build a diagram step by step.

Start with point P as the center. Let me fix coordinate system with P at origin.

Let me define point L at (0, -2) (assuming radius 2). Then since JL is a diameter, point J would be at (0, 2). Now, the line JL passes through P, as required.

Now, line PL goes from P(0,0) to L(0,-2). So direction of PL is downward y-axis. Then PN is perpendicular to PL, so direction of PN is along x-axis. Therefore, point N is somewhere along the x-axis. Since N is on the circle, it can be at (2, 0) or (-2, 0). But (2, 0) is point K, and (-2, 0) is point M. Wait, but earlier, we had points M and K on the x-axis. Wait, but if line MK is a diameter, then points M and K are at (-2, 0) and (2, 0). So if N is along x-axis, then N would coincide with M or K. But N is another distinct point. This suggests a contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption may be flawed.

Wait, but maybe the line PN isn't necessarily aligned with the x-axis. Wait, the line PN is perpendicular to PL. PL is along negative y-axis. Therefore, PN must be along positive x or negative x axis. But if N is a distinct point, then it cannot be M or K. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my previous assumption.

Ah! Wait, perhaps line MK is not the x-axis. Maybe I need to adjust the positions. Let me re-examine.

If line MK passes through P, then MK is a diameter. Similarly, line JL passes through P, so JL is another diameter. These two diameters MK and JL intersect at P. Now, PN is perpendicular to PL. Let me think of PL as one radius, and PN as another radius, perpendicular to PL. Therefore, the angle between PL and PN is 90 degrees. So if I take PL as one radius, say pointing towards L, then PN is pointing in a direction perpendicular to PL. So if I consider PL as along some direction, then PN is along a direction 90 degrees from it.

Let me assign coordinates again. Let me place point P at (0, 0). Let me choose coordinates such that point L is at (1, 0) for simplicity (but scaled appropriately). Wait, but radius is 2. So let me scale accordingly. Let me suppose that PL is along the positive x-axis. Wait, but earlier, we have line JL passing through P, so J is diametrically opposite to L. So if L is at (2, 0), then J would be at (-2, 0). But then line JL is along the x-axis, passing through P(0,0). Now, PN is perpendicular to PL. Since PL is along the x-axis from P(0,0) to L(2,0), then PN must be along the y-axis. So point N is at (0, 2) or (0, -2). But (0,2) would be J if J is at (-2,0)? No, wait, if J is at (-2,0), then (0,2) is another point on the circle. Let me check. The radius is 2, so yes, (0,2) is on the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2. So point N could be at (0,2). But then, point J is at (-2,0), and point N is at (0,2). Then PN is from (0,0) to (0,2), which is vertical, and PL is from (0,0) to (2,0), horizontal. They are indeed perpendicular. That works.

So let me assign coordinates:

- P: (0, 0)
- L: (2, 0)
- J: (-2, 0) (since JL is diameter)
- N: (0, 2)
- Now, line MK is another diameter passing through P. So points M and K are on the circle such that line MK passes through P. Let me choose M and K along some other diameter. For example, let me choose line MK to be vertical. But wait, since PN is already along the y-axis (from P(0,0) to N(0,2)), but MK is another diameter. Let me pick another direction for MK. Let me suppose that MK is along the line making some angle with the axes. However, we also have the given angle ∠MPL = 65 degrees. Let's recall that ∠MPL is the angle at P between points M and L. So, with P at (0,0), L at (2,0), and M somewhere on the circle such that the angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees.

So, vectors PM and PL form a 65-degree angle. Let me calculate coordinates of M. Let me denote vector PL as going from P(0,0) to L(2,0), so direction (2, 0). Vector PM goes from P(0,0) to M(x,y), which is a point on the circle x² + y² = 4.

The angle between vectors PM and PL is 65 degrees. Using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (PM · PL) / (|PM| |PL|)

Here θ = 65 degrees, |PM| = |PL| = 2 (since both are radii). PM · PL = (x)(2) + y*0 = 2x.

Therefore,

cos(65°) = (2x)/(2 * 2) => cos(65°) = x/2 => x = 2 cos(65°)

Compute x value:

cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226

Thus, x ≈ 2 * 0.4226 ≈ 0.8452

Then, since x² + y² = 4,

y² = 4 - x² ≈ 4 - (0.8452)^2 ≈ 4 - 0.7143 ≈ 3.2857

Therefore, y ≈ ±√3.2857 ≈ ±1.813

So coordinates of M are approximately (0.8452, 1.813) or (0.8452, -1.813). Depending on the quadrant. Since angle between PM and PL (which is along positive x-axis) is 65 degrees, so if the angle is measured counterclockwise from PL to PM, then M would be in upper half-plane. Let's assume M is above the x-axis. So M ≈ (0.8452, 1.813). Then point K is diametrically opposite to M across P. Since line MK passes through P, so K is the reflection of M over P. So coordinates of K would be (-0.8452, -1.813).

Now, with points defined:

- P: (0, 0)
- L: (2, 0)
- J: (-2, 0)
- N: (0, 2)
- M: approx (0.8452, 1.813)
- K: approx (-0.8452, -1.813)

Now, we need to find the measure of angle NJK, which is ∠NJK. So point J is (-2, 0), point N is (0, 2), point K is (-0.8452, -1.813). So angle at J between points N, J, K.

To find ∠NJK, we can compute the angle using coordinates.

First, find vectors JN and JK.

Vector JN = N - J = (0 - (-2), 2 - 0) = (2, 2)

Vector JK = K - J = (-0.8452 - (-2), -1.813 - 0) = (1.1548, -1.813)

Now, the angle between vectors JN and JK is ∠NJK. Use the dot product formula again.

Dot product of JN and JK: (2)(1.1548) + (2)(-1.813) ≈ 2.3096 - 3.626 ≈ -1.3164

Magnitude of JN: sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8) ≈ 2.8284

Magnitude of JK: sqrt((1.1548)^2 + (-1.813)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.333 + 3.287) ≈ sqrt(4.62) ≈ 2.15

Then, cosθ = (-1.3164) / (2.8284 * 2.15) ≈ -1.3164 / 6.08 ≈ -0.2165

So θ ≈ arccos(-0.2165) ≈ 102.5 degrees. Wait, but none of the answer choices is 102.5. The options are A. 25, B. 75, C. 90, D. 155. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests I made an error.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me verify.

Wait, maybe I assigned the wrong coordinates for K. Earlier, when I computed point K as diametrically opposite to M, but if M is (x, y), then K would be (-x, -y). Wait, if M is (approx 0.8452, 1.813), then K would be (-0.8452, -1.813). Correct.

Vector JK is from J(-2, 0) to K(-0.8452, -1.813): Δx = -0.8452 - (-2) = 1.1548, Δy = -1.813 - 0 = -1.813. Correct.

Vector JN is from J(-2, 0) to N(0, 2): Δx = 0 - (-2) = 2, Δy = 2 - 0 = 2. Correct.

Dot product: 2*1.1548 + 2*(-1.813) = 2.3096 - 3.626 ≈ -1.3164. Correct.

Magnitudes:

|JN| = sqrt(2² + 2²) = sqrt(8) ≈ 2.8284. Correct.

|JK|: sqrt( (1.1548)^2 + (-1.813)^2 ). Let me calculate:

(1.1548)^2 ≈ 1.333, (-1.813)^2 ≈ 3.287. Sum ≈ 4.62. Square root ≈ 2.15. Correct.

So cos(theta) ≈ -1.3164 / (2.8284 * 2.15) ≈ -1.3164 / 6.08 ≈ -0.2165. Arccos(-0.2165) is indeed around 102.5 degrees. But this isn't among the answer choices. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. It says "Find m∠NJK". Perhaps I'm calculating the angle incorrectly. Or maybe there's a mistake in assigning coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle NJK refers to the arc measure instead of the inscribed angle? Wait, no. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if I can find the intercepted arc, then multiply by 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe I need to find the arc measure corresponding to angle NJK. Let me think. ∠NJK intercepts arc NK. So the measure of ∠NJK is half of arc NK. So if I can find arc NK, then divide by 2.

Earlier, we had arc ML = 65 degrees, arc LN = 90 degrees. Let me try to calculate arc NK.

Points N, K. How much arc is between N and K?

From earlier, points:

- N is at (0, 2) → corresponds to angle 90 degrees from positive x-axis (since it's on y-axis).
- K is at (-0.8452, -1.813). Let me find its angle.

Coordinates of K are (x, y) = (-0.8452, -1.813). The angle theta from positive x-axis to point K is arctangent(y/x) = arctan(-1.813 / -0.8452) = arctan(2.145). Since both x and y are negative, it's in third quadrant. arctan(2.145) ≈ 65 degrees. So total angle is 180 + 65 = 245 degrees. Wait, but earlier, we had that angle between PM and PL was 65 degrees. Wait, PM was at 65 degrees from PL (positive x-axis). So if point M is at 65 degrees, then point K is diametrically opposite, so angle for K is 65 + 180 = 245 degrees. Wait, but earlier, we found that point K is at (-0.8452, -1.813), which corresponds to angle 245 degrees. Point N is at (0,2), which is 90 degrees. So arc from N to K is from 90 degrees to 245 degrees. The difference is 245 - 90 = 155 degrees. But since arc measure is always the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. Wait, but 155 degrees is less than 180, so it's the minor arc. Therefore, arc NK is 155 degrees. Thus, inscribed angle ∠NJK intercepting arc NK would be 155 / 2 = 77.5 degrees. Closest to option B (75) or D (155)? Wait, the question says "Find m∠NJK". If it's an inscribed angle, it would be half of arc NK, which is 155/2=77.5, which is close to 75 (option B). But why did my previous calculation give ~102.5 degrees? There's inconsistency here. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe I confused the intercepted arc. Let me double-check: angle at J, so ∠NJK intercepts arc from N to K not containing J. Wait, depends on the position of J. Let me think. Points N is at (0,2), K is at 245 degrees, and J is at (-2,0) which is 180 degrees. So drawing points N (top), J (left), K (third quadrant). The angle at J between N and K would intercept arc from N to K that does not contain J. Wait, but since J is at 180 degrees, and N is at 90 degrees, K at 245 degrees. The arc from N to K not containing J would go clockwise from N to K, passing through lower part. The measure of that arc would be 245 - 90 = 155 degrees, as before. Therefore, inscribed angle ∠NJK is half of that, 77.5 degrees. But according to my coordinate calculation, it gave ~102.5 degrees. Why the discrepancy?

Because I think I mixed up the intercepted arc. Wait, maybe the angle ∠NJK intercepts arc NK that contains J? No, inscribed angle intercepts arc opposite to the angle. So if you have angle at J, it intercepts arc NK that doesn't include J. But in this case, the arc from N to K not including J would be 155 degrees, leading to angle 77.5 degrees. However, the coordinate calculation gave me ~102.5 degrees. There's a conflict here. So where is the mistake?

Wait, let's recalculate the angle using the coordinates. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Vectors JN and JK were:

JN: from J(-2, 0) to N(0, 2): (2, 2)

JK: from J(-2, 0) to K(-0.8452, -1.813): (1.1548, -1.813)

Calculating the angle between these vectors:

Dot product: (2)(1.1548) + (2)(-1.813) = 2.3096 - 3.626 ≈ -1.3164

Length of JN: sqrt(2² + 2²) = sqrt(8) ≈ 2.8284

Length of JK: sqrt( (1.1548)^2 + (-1.813)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.333 + 3.287) ≈ sqrt(4.62) ≈ 2.15

So cos(theta) ≈ -1.3164 / (2.8284 * 2.15) ≈ -1.3164 / 6.08 ≈ -0.2165

Which gives theta ≈ arccos(-0.2165). Let me compute this precisely.

arccos(-0.2165) is in radians? Let me convert to degrees.

cos(102.5 degrees) ≈ cos(90+12.5) = -sin(12.5) ≈ -0.2164. Yes! Exactly. So theta ≈ 102.5 degrees. But this contradicts the inscribed angle theorem giving 77.5 degrees. Why?

Because the inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, in this case, the angle ∠NJK might not be intercepting the arc NK. Wait, let me think again. When you have an inscribed angle at J, it intercepts the arc that is opposite, i.e., not containing J. But depending on the position of the points, sometimes the intercepted arc could be major or minor. Wait, but in this case, arc NK not containing J is 155 degrees, so angle should be 77.5 degrees. But according to the coordinate calculation, it's 102.5 degrees. This suggests that I've made a mistake in identifying which arc is intercepted.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the other arc, the major arc NK. Let me check. The measure of the major arc NK would be 360 - 155 = 205 degrees. Then the inscribed angle would be 205 / 2 = 102.5 degrees, matching the coordinate calculation. Ah! So the confusion arises from whether the angle intercepts the minor or major arc. 

How do we determine which arc is intercepted? Inscribed angle intercepts the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that does not contain the vertex of the angle. So in this case, angle at J, so the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain J. Let's visualize:

Points:

- N is at top (90 degrees)
- K is at 245 degrees (third quadrant)
- J is at left (180 degrees)

So the arc from N to K that does not contain J would go from N (90 degrees) clockwise to K (245 degrees), passing through the bottom part of the circle, which is the minor arc of 155 degrees. But why does the calculation show angle of 102.5 degrees, which corresponds to half of major arc? 

Wait, this suggests that my understanding is incorrect. Maybe the angle ∠NJK intercepts the arc that contains J? No, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, let me think again. When you have an inscribed angle, the angle is half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the angle's sides. So if the angle is at J, then the sides are JN and JK. These two sides extend to meet the circle at N and K. So the intercepted arc is the arc from N to K that does not pass through J. But depending on the positions, sometimes the angle could be reflex, but usually, we consider the smaller arc. 

Wait, but in this configuration, if you draw angle at J between N and K, the arc intercepted is the one that is opposite to J. Let me draw this mentally: point J is at left side, N is at top, K is at third quadrant. So the arc from N to K not containing J would be the arc going from N (top) down to K (third quadrant), passing through the bottom of the circle. That arc is 155 degrees. So the angle should be half of that, 77.5 degrees. But why does the calculation give 102.5 degrees?

This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding. Let me verify with another approach. Let me compute the central angle for arc NK, and then see.

Central angle between N and K: points N is at (0,2), which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. Point K is at angle 245 degrees. The central angle between N and K is 245 - 90 = 155 degrees. So arc NK is 155 degrees. Then, the inscribed angle over this arc is 155 / 2 = 77.5 degrees. 

However, according to the coordinate calculation, the angle is 102.5 degrees. This contradiction indicates an error in assuming which arc is intercepted. Perhaps the angle intercepts the other arc? Let me check the central angle for the other arc. The other arc from N to K passing through J would be 360 - 155 = 205 degrees. Half of that is 102.5 degrees, which matches the coordinate calculation. So why does the angle intercept the larger arc?

Ah! Because the position of the points determines which arc is intercepted. If the angle is formed by extending the sides beyond the circle, or depending on the orientation. Wait, the inscribed angle intercepts the arc that is opposite to the angle. But in this case, if the angle is at J, and the arc that is opposite would depend on the positioning. 

Wait, let's think of the circle with points N, J, K. If you have angle at J, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing J. But if the arc from N to K not containing J is 155 degrees, then the angle should be 77.5. But why is the coordinate calculation showing 102.5? 

Perhaps I made a mistake in determining which arc is intercepted. Let me think differently: the measure of the inscribed angle is determined by the arc it subtends. If the angle is greater than 90 degrees, it subtends the major arc. For instance, if three points are arranged such that the angle is obtuse, it subtends the major arc.

In this case, the angle at J is ∠NJK. If points N, J, K are positioned such that J is outside the arc NK, then the angle would subtend the major arc. Wait, but how to determine that?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the coordinates to calculate the actual central angle. From the coordinates, we have:

Point N: (0,2), point K: (-0.8452, -1.813). Let me find the central angle between N and K. 

Vector PN is from P(0,0) to N(0,2): direction (0,1)

Vector PK is from P(0,0) to K(-0.8452, -1.813): direction (-0.8452, -1.813)

The angle between PN and PK is the central angle between N and K. Let me compute it using dot product.

Dot product of PN and PK vectors: (0)(-0.8452) + (2)(-1.813) = -3.626

Magnitude of PN: 2

Magnitude of PK: sqrt((-0.8452)^2 + (-1.813)^2) = sqrt(0.714 + 3.287) = sqrt(4) = 2. 

So cos(theta) = (-3.626)/(2*2) = -3.626/4 ≈ -0.9065

So theta = arccos(-0.9065) ≈ 155 degrees. Yes! This matches the earlier calculation. So the central angle between N and K is 155 degrees. Therefore, the inscribed angle subtending this arc would be 155/2 = 77.5 degrees. But why does the calculation using vectors at J give 102.5 degrees? There must be a misunderstanding in which arc is being subtended.

Wait, the key here is that the inscribed angle ∠NJK is subtended by arc NK, but depending on the position of J, it could be subtending the major arc or minor arc. If J is on the circumference, then the inscribed angle subtended by arc NK could be either the minor arc or major arc, depending on which arc is opposite to the angle.

Wait, let me recall: the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is the angle formed at any point on the circumference by the ends of the arc. So if the arc is the minor arc NK, then the inscribed angle is half of it. If the arc is the major arc NK, then the inscribed angle is half of that. But the angle ∠NJK is determined by the position of J. If J is on the circumference, then depending on where J is, the angle could subtend either arc.

In our case, point J is at (-2, 0). Let me visualize: N is at top, K is at third quadrant, J is at left. So if I look at angle at J between N and K, the arc that is intercepted is the one that doesn't pass through J. Let me imagine: from N to K, not passing through J. That arc is the minor arc of 155 degrees. But why does the calculation give 102.5 degrees?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about specific cases. If I have a circle, and points N and K on the circle, and point J also on the circle. If I form an angle at J between N and K, then the angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to J. If J is on the circumference, then the arc opposite to J is the one that doesn't contain J. So if the arc from N to K not containing J is 155 degrees, then the angle should be 77.5 degrees. But the calculation using coordinates shows 102.5 degrees. 

Wait, maybe I have to consider that the angle is actually subtending the major arc. Let me see: if the central angle between N and K is 155 degrees, then the major arc is 360 - 155 = 205 degrees. An inscribed angle subtending the major arc would be 205/2 = 102.5 degrees. So why is the angle subtending the major arc? Because the position of J is such that it is on the opposite side of the circle from the minor arc NK.

Wait, if point J is on the circumference, and the arc NK not containing J is 155 degrees, then the inscribed angle at J would be half of the arc that is opposite, which would be the major arc. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the arc that it subtends. If the angle is formed by points N, J, K, then it subtends the arc NK that does not contain J. So if the arc NK not containing J is 155 degrees, then angle is 77.5. But if the arc containing J is 205 degrees, then angle would be 102.5. So which one is it?

Wait, the key is to determine which arc is intercepted by the angle. The intercepted arc is the one that is not containing the vertex of the angle. So if the angle is at J, then the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain J. So if the arc from N to K not containing J is 155 degrees, then the angle should be 77.5. But why does the coordinate calculation give 102.5? 

Wait, let me check with another method. Let me calculate the central angle between N and K, which is 155 degrees, as established. Now, if I create an inscribed angle subtending this arc, it should be half of that, 77.5 degrees. But the calculation using coordinates gave me 102.5 degrees. This suggests that the angle I calculated using coordinates is not the one subtending the arc NK, but rather the arc that contains J. 

Wait, let me think: if I stand at point J and look at N and K, the angle I see depends on which arc is between N and K. If the arc from N to K passing through J is 205 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be half of that. But how can I know which arc is being considered?

Maybe I need to use the property that the sum of the measures of the inscribed angles subtended by the same arc is related to the arcs. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the coordinate assignment.

Wait, let me try to calculate the central angle between N and K, which we said was 155 degrees. If the inscribed angle subtending this arc is 77.5 degrees, then why does the coordinate calculation give 102.5? Let me recalculate the angle using the central angle. 

If the central angle is 155 degrees, then the inscribed angle is 77.5 degrees. But according to the calculation using vectors, it's 102.5. So there must be a mistake in the coordinate setup. Let me review the steps.

Earlier, I assumed that point L is at (2, 0), J at (-2, 0), N at (0, 2). Then, point M is calculated such that angle MPL is 65 degrees. Let me verify that calculation.

Given PL is from P(0,0) to L(2,0), and PM makes a 65-degree angle with PL. So the direction of PM is 65 degrees from PL (along x-axis). So PM is at 65 degrees from x-axis, hence coordinates of M are (2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65°). Wait, earlier I calculated x = 2 cos(65°), y = 2 sin(65°). Let me calculate that properly.

Wait, previously, I thought PM · PL = 2x, but let me redo it.

Vector PL is (2, 0). Vector PM is (x, y). The angle between PM and PL is 65 degrees. So:

cos(65°) = (PM · PL) / (|PM||PL|) = (2x + 0*y)/ (2 * 2) = (2x)/4 = x/2.

Thus, x = 2 cos(65°). Yes. And y = 2 sin(65°). So coordinates of M are (2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65°). 

Let me compute cos(65°) and sin(65°):

cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226, so x ≈ 0.8452

sin(65°) ≈ 0.9063, so y ≈ 1.8126

So point M is approximately (0.8452, 1.8126). Then point K is diametrically opposite to M, so K is (-0.8452, -1.8126). 

Now, let's calculate the central angle between N(0,2) and K(-0.8452, -1.8126). 

Vector PN is (0,2), vector PK is (-0.8452, -1.8126). The angle between these vectors is calculated as:

cos(theta) = (PN · PK) / (|PN| |PK|) = (0*(-0.8452) + 2*(-1.8126)) / (2 * 2) = (-3.6252)/4 = -0.9063

Which is cos(theta) = -0.9063, so theta ≈ 155 degrees (since cos(155°) ≈ cos(180-25) = -cos(25°) ≈ -0.9063). Yes! So the central angle between N and K is 155 degrees. Hence, the inscribed angle subtending this arc would be 77.5 degrees. 

But why does the calculation using vectors at J give 102.5 degrees? This suggests that the angle ∠NJK is not subtending the arc NK, but another arc. 

Wait, maybe I'm measuring the wrong angle. Let me think: if I have points N, J, K on the circle, and want to find ∠NJK, it's possible that this angle is actually subtending the arc from N to K passing through J, which is the major arc of 205 degrees, giving 102.5 degrees. But how to determine which arc it subtends?

The rule is: the inscribed angle subtends the arc that is opposite to the angle. So if the angle is at J, it subtends the arc that does not contain J. But in this case, the arc from N to K not containing J is 155 degrees, so the angle should be 77.5. But why does the calculation give 102.5? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the angle. The dot product gave us a negative cosine, indicating that the angle between vectors JN and JK is obtuse, 102.5 degrees. This suggests that the angle is obtuse, which would mean it subtends the major arc. But how? 

Wait, if the inscribed angle is obtuse, it must subtend a major arc. Because the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. If the angle is obtuse (>90 degrees), the intercepted arc must be >180 degrees. So in this case, the angle is 102.5 degrees, which is obtuse, so it must subtend a major arc of 205 degrees. Hence, the arc intercepted is 205 degrees, and the angle is 205/2 = 102.5 degrees. 

So why is the arc intercepted 205 degrees? Because the angle at J is formed such that it subtends the arc that goes from N to K passing through the side opposite to J. Let me visualize: point J is at (-2, 0). Points N is at (0,2), K is at (-0.8452, -1.8126). So the arc from N to K passing through the side opposite to J (which is the right side of the circle) would go from N (top) through the right side to K (third quadrant), passing through the right semicircle. This arc would be the major arc NK, measuring 205 degrees. Hence, the angle at J is half of that, 102.5 degrees. 

But earlier, we calculated the central angle between N and K as 155 degrees. How can this be? Because there are two arcs between N and K: the minor arc of 155 degrees and the major arc of 205 degrees. So the angle ∠NJK subtends the major arc NK, hence 205 degrees, giving 102.5 degrees. 

So the issue was that I initially thought the angle subtended the minor arc, but actually, due to the position of J, it subtends the major arc. Hence, the measure is 102.5 degrees. But this doesn't match any of the answer choices. The closest is D. 155, but that's the central angle. Or B. 75, which is close to 77.5. 

Wait, but the answer choices are A. 25, B. 75, C. 90, D. 155. 

Hmm, this suggests that there is still a miscalculation. Let me try to find another approach.

Let me recall that in the problem statement, it says "NP ⊥ PL". So, in our setup, NP is perpendicular to PL. In our coordinates, NP is from P(0,0) to N(0,2), which is vertical, and PL is from P(0,0) to L(2,0), which is horizontal. They are perpendicular, as required.

Also, angle MPL is 65 degrees. In our setup, this angle is between PM and PL, which we ensured by placing M at 65 degrees from x-axis.

Now, let me try to calculate the measure of arc NJK. Wait, the question says "Find m∠NJK", which we've determined is 102.5 degrees, but this isn't an option. However, maybe there's a different interpretation of the question. Let me read the question again:

"Find m∠NJK." 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the measure of arc NJK, not the angle. But the notation m∠NJK typically denotes the measure of the angle. Alternatively, it could be a typo, and it should be arc NJK. Let me check the original problem statement:

"GIVEN... QUESTION: In ∘P, m∠MP L = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJK."

No, it definitely says "m∠NJK". So it's an angle. 

But none of the options match 102.5. Let me reconsider all steps for errors.

Another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in calculating the central angle between N and K. Let me recheck.

Vector PN is (0,2), vector PK is (-0.8452, -1.8126). Their dot product is 0*(-0.8452) + 2*(-1.8126) = -3.6252. Magnitude of PN is 2, magnitude of PK is 2. So cos(theta) = -3.6252/(2*2) = -0.9063, which is cos(155 degrees), since cos(155°) = cos(180-25) = -cos(25°) ≈ -0.9063. So central angle is 155 degrees. Hence, arc NK is 155 degrees. 

Now, if the angle ∠NJK is an inscribed angle subtending this arc, it should be 77.5 degrees. But why does the coordinate calculation give 102.5? It must be that I'm measuring the supplementary angle. Let me think: the angle between vectors JN and JK is 102.5 degrees, but the inscribed angle could be the supplement, 77.5 degrees. How?

Wait, no. The angle between vectors JN and JK is the angle at J, which should be the inscribed angle. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, let me calculate the angle using another method. Let me use complex numbers or parametrize the circle.

Alternatively, let's use the law of cosines on triangle NJK. 

We know the lengths of NJ, JK, and NK, but since all points are on the circle with radius 2, we can compute these distances.

First, let's calculate the length of NJ: from N(0,2) to J(-2,0). Distance is sqrt[(0 - (-2))^2 + (2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 4] = sqrt(8) = 2√2.

Length of JK: from J(-2,0) to K(-0.8452, -1.8126). Delta x: -0.8452 - (-2) = 1.1548, delta y: -1.8126 - 0 = -1.8126. Length is sqrt(1.1548² + 1.8126²). Let me calculate:

1.1548² ≈ 1.333, 1.8126² ≈ 3.285, sum ≈ 4.618, sqrt ≈ 2.149. So approximately 2.15.

Length of NK: from N(0,2) to K(-0.8452, -1.8126). Delta x: -0.8452 - 0 = -0.8452, delta y: -1.8126 - 2 = -3.8126. Length is sqrt((-0.8452)^2 + (-3.8126)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.714 + 14.535) ≈ sqrt(15.249) ≈ 3.905.

Now, using the law of cosines on triangle NJK:

NK² = NJ² + JK² - 2*NJ*JK*cos(angle NJK)

Plugging values:

(3.905)^2 ≈ 15.249

(2√2)^2 = 8

(2.15)^2 ≈ 4.62

So:

15.249 ≈ 8 + 4.62 - 2*(2√2)*(2.15)*cos(angle NJK)

Calculate RHS: 8 + 4.62 = 12.62

So:

15.249 ≈ 12.62 - 2*(2.828)*(2.15)*cos(angle NJK)

Wait, this seems off. Wait, the law of cosines is:

NK² = NJ² + JK² - 2*NJ*JK*cos(angle NJK)

So rearranged:

cos(angle NJK) = (NJ² + JK² - NK²) / (2*NJ*JK)

Plug in the numbers:

Numerator: 8 + 4.62 - 15.249 ≈ 12.62 - 15.249 ≈ -2.629

Denominator: 2 * 2.828 * 2.15 ≈ 2 * 2.828 * 2.15 ≈ 12.14

So cos(angle NJK) ≈ -2.629 / 12.14 ≈ -0.2165, which matches our earlier calculation. So angle NJK ≈ 102.5 degrees. This confirms the calculation.

But this doesn't match any of the answer choices. What's going on? Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I didn't misread anything.

Original problem: "In ∘P, m∠MPL = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJK."

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the measure of arc NJK, not the angle? If it's arc NJK, then let's calculate that.

Arc NJK would be the arc from N to K passing through J. Which is the major arc NK, which we calculated as 205 degrees. But 205 is not an option. The closest is D. 155, which is the minor arc. But why would it be asked as arc NJK? 

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be arc NJK, which would be the same as arc NK. But still, 155 is not an option. 

Wait, let me check if there's another way to interpret the given conditions. Let me go back to the beginning.

Given that all points M, K, J, L, N are on the circle with center P. Lines MK and JL pass through P, so they are diameters. PN is perpendicular to PL, so angle NPL is 90 degrees. Given that m∠MPL = 65 degrees, which is the angle at P between M and L. 

Let me try to find relationships between the arcs.

From the given, angle MPL is 65 degrees, which is a central angle. So arc ML is 65 degrees. 

Also, since PN is perpendicular to PL, angle NPL is 90 degrees, so arc NL is 90 degrees. 

Now, let's try to find the measure of arc NJK. Wait, arc NJK would be the arc from N to K passing through J. Let me see.

Let me add up the arcs:

Starting from N, going through J to K. Let's break it down.

Arc NL is 90 degrees (since angle NPL is 90 degrees). Arc LJ is 180 degrees, since JL is a diameter. So from L to J is 180 degrees. Then, arc MJ is ? Wait, let me think.

Wait, arc ML is 65 degrees. Since JL is a diameter, arc JL is 180 degrees. Let me try to find the relationship between these arcs.

Let me consider the entire circle as 360 degrees.

We have arc ML = 65 degrees. Arc NL = 90 degrees. Let me try to find arc NJK.

Wait, let me try to find the position of K. Since line MK is a diameter, so arc MK is 180 degrees. Since arc ML is 65 degrees, then arc LK would be arc MK - arc ML = 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Wait, no. If arc ML is 65 degrees, and M and K are endpoints of a diameter, then arc from M to L is 65 degrees, and arc from L to K would be arc from L to M plus arc from M to K? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If MK is a diameter, then arc MK is 180 degrees. Arc ML is 65 degrees, so from M to L is 65 degrees. Then, from L to K would be arc from L to M plus arc from M to K? No, since MK is a diameter, from L to K would be arc from L to M (65 degrees) plus arc from M to K (which is 180 - 65 = 115 degrees)? Not sure. Let me think in terms of directions.

Let me imagine the circle with center P. Let me assume that arc ML is 65 degrees, so from M to L is 65 degrees. Since MK is a diameter, arc from M to K is 180 degrees. So from L to K would be arc from L to M (65 degrees) plus arc from M to K (180 degrees)? No, that would be 245 degrees, which is more than 180. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to use the known arcs.

We have:

- Arc ML = 65 degrees (given)
- Arc NL = 90 degrees (since PN is perpendicular to PL)
- Arc JL = 180 degrees (since JL is a diameter)

Let me try to find arc NJK, which is the arc from N to K passing through J. This would be arc NJ + arc JK.

But how to find arc NJ and arc JK?

Let me try to express everything in terms of known arcs.

First, arc NL is 90 degrees. Arc JL is 180 degrees. Let me see if I can find arc NJ.

From N to J: since JL is a diameter, and arc JL is 180 degrees. Let me find the position of N relative to J.

If arc NL is 90 degrees, and arc JL is 180 degrees, then from N to L is 90 degrees, and from L to J is 180 degrees. So from N to J is arc NL + arc LJ = 90 + 180 = 270 degrees? Wait, but that would be the major arc NJ. But we need the minor arc NJ.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to draw the circle with the known arcs.

Let me start by placing point L at some position. Let me assume that arc NL is 90 degrees, so from N to L is 90 degrees. Let me place N at 0 degrees, so L is at 90 degrees. Then, since JL is a diameter, point J is diametrically opposite to L. If L is at 90 degrees, then J is at 90 + 180 = 270 degrees.

Now, arc ML is 65 degrees. Let me assume that point M is somewhere on the circle. Since MK is a diameter, K is diametrically opposite to M. Let me assume that arc ML is 65 degrees, so from M to L is 65 degrees. Since L is at 90 degrees, then M is at 90 - 65 = 25 degrees. Then, K, being diametrically opposite to M, is at 25 + 180 = 205 degrees.

Now, we need to find the measure of arc NJK. Assuming N is at 0 degrees, J is at 270 degrees, K is at 205 degrees. So arc NJK would be from N(0) to K(205) passing through J(270). Let me calculate this arc.

From N(0) to J(270): this is 270 degrees. From J(270) to K(205): this is 205 - 270 = -65 degrees, but since it's a circle, we take the positive equivalent: 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. Wait, this seems complex. Alternatively, the arc from N to K passing through J is the sum of arc NJ and arc JK.

Arc NJ: from N(0) to J(270) is 270 degrees. Arc JK: from J(270) to K(205). Since K is at 205, and J is at 270, the arc from J to K is 205 - 270 + 360 = 295 degrees? No, that's not correct. Let me calculate the shorter arc from J to K. Since K is at 205 degrees, and J is at 270 degrees, the arc from J to K clockwise is 270 - 205 = 65 degrees. The arc counterclockwise is 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. So the arc from J to K is 65 degrees. Therefore, the total arc NJK passing through J is arc NJ (270 degrees) + arc JK (65 degrees) = 335 degrees. But this is more than 360, which is impossible. Clearly, this approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I placed the points incorrectly. Let me try again.

Let me fix arc NL = 90 degrees, arc JL = 180 degrees, arc ML = 65 degrees.

Let me place point L at 0 degrees. Then, since arc NL is 90 degrees, point N is at 90 degrees (since it's 90 degrees from L). Since JL is a diameter, point J is at 180 degrees (opposite to L). Now, arc ML is 65 degrees. Let me find the position of M. If arc ML is 65 degrees, then from M to L (0 degrees) is 65 degrees. So M is at 0 - 65 = -65 degrees, or 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. Let's say M is at 295 degrees. Then, since MK is a diameter, K is at 295 + 180 = 475 - 360 = 115 degrees.

Now, we need to find the measure of arc NJK, which is from N to K passing through J. Point N is at 90 degrees, J is at 180 degrees, K is at 115 degrees. So arc NJK would go from N(90) to J(180) to K(115). Wait, but K is at 115 degrees, which is between N(90) and J(180)? No, 115 is between 90 and 180. So the arc from N(90) to K(115) passing through J(180) would be the major arc from N to K passing through J. Let me calculate this arc.

From N(90) to J(180): 90 degrees. From J(180) to K(115): this is 115 - 180 + 360 = 295 degrees? No, it's better to calculate the arc from J to K. Since K is at 115 degrees and J is at 180 degrees, the arc from J to K clockwise is 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. So total arc NJK is 90 + 65 = 155 degrees. 

Ah! So the measure of arc NJK is 155 degrees. But the question asks for m∠NJK, which is an inscribed angle subtending this arc. Wait, no. If the arc NJK is 155 degrees, then the inscribed angle subtending it would be 155/2 = 77.5 degrees. But this is still not one of the options. However, if the question actually asked for the measure of arc NJK, then it would be 155 degrees, which is option D. 

But the question says "m∠NJK", which is an angle. However, if there was a misinterpretation, and the question meant arc NJK, then the answer would be D. 155. Given that the calculation using the arc NJK (major arc) gives 155 degrees, and the inscribed angle would be 77.5, but since 155 is one of the choices, it's possible that the question intended to ask for the arc measure. 

Alternatively, let me check if there's a different approach. Let me recall that in the beginning, we had the central angle between N and K as 155 degrees, and if the angle ∠NJK is an inscribed angle subtending this arc, it would be 77.5. But since 77.5 is not an option, and 155 is, it's possible that the question meant arc NJK, and there was a typo in the question. 

Given that, and considering the closest option to 77.5 is B. 75, or D. 155. Since 155 is the measure of the arc, and the angle is 77.5, which is close to 75, but not quite. Alternatively, if the question is asking for the arc measure, then D. 155 is the answer.

Given the ambiguity, and considering that in the calculation using the arc NJK (which is 155 degrees) is option D, and given that the angle calculation gave 102.5 which is not an option, but the arc measure is 155, which is option D, I will choose D. 1
