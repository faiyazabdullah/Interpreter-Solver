MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. There's a circle centered at O with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G on it since they all lie on the circle with center O and radius 4.0. The points are connected through various lines, so maybe some chords or secants?

The question asks for the measure of arc CF (m∠CF). Let me note down the given information:

- Measure of arc FE is 118 degrees.
- Measure of arc AB is 108 degrees.
- Measure of angle EGB is 52 degrees.
- Measure of angle EFB is 30 degrees.

First, let me recall that angles formed by chords, secants, or tangents relate to arcs in specific ways. For example, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, angles outside the circle can be related to the difference of arcs.

Let me start by drawing the circle with center O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are on the circumference. Now, looking at the constraints:

- Point A lies on line DB. So, line DB passes through point A. Similarly, point C lies on lines DE and DG. Wait, Point C lies on both Line(D,E) and Line(D,G)? That would mean that point C is the intersection of lines DE and DG? But since D is a common point, unless lines DE and DG intersect at D, but then C would be D? Wait, no. If C lies on both lines DE and DG, then C must be the intersection of those two lines. However, since D is already on both lines, unless C is another intersection point. Wait, but lines DE and DG both pass through D. Therefore, their only intersection is at D. So unless C is D? But that can't be because C is a distinct point. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo here? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints.

Wait, the constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, E)) — meaning point C is on the line connecting D and E.

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, G)) — same thing, point C is on the line connecting D and G.

So, point C is on both lines DE and DG. Which implies that lines DE and DG intersect at point C. But lines DE and DG share point D. Therefore, unless lines DE and DG are the same line, which would mean that points D, E, G are colinear. But then C would be somewhere along that line. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not straight lines but something else? No, the notation Line(D, E) is a straight line between D and E. Therefore, if point C lies on both DE and DG, then lines DE and DG must meet at C. But since both lines DE and DG start at D, they can only intersect at D unless they are different lines passing through D. Therefore, point C must be D? But that contradicts since C is a separate point. Therefore, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the lines are not starting from D? Wait, Line(D, E) is a line segment from D to E? Or an infinite line? In geometry problems, usually, when we talk about points lying on a line, it's the entire line, not just segments. So, if point C lies on line DE and line DG, then lines DE and DG intersect at C. Since both lines pass through D, the only way they can intersect at another point C is if lines DE and DG are not overlapping except at D. Therefore, point C is the second intersection point of lines DE and DG. Wait, but lines DE and DG are two different lines passing through D. So, if you extend them beyond D, they might intersect again? Wait, no. Two lines that intersect at D can't intersect again unless they are the same line. Therefore, unless lines DE and DG are the same line, which would imply that E and G are the same point, which they aren't. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses Line(D, E) as a line segment, not an infinite line. Then, point C lies on segment DE and also on segment DG. So, point C is the intersection of segments DE and DG. But since both segments start at D, the only intersection would be at D. Hence, again, unless C is D, which it isn't. This suggests that there's something wrong with my understanding. Perhaps there's a typo in the constraints? For instance, maybe one of the points is different. Alternatively, maybe the lines are not DE and DG but other combinations. Let me check again:

Original constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, B)) → A is on line DB.

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, E)) → C is on line DE.

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, G)) → C is on line DG.

Therefore, C is on both DE and DG. So lines DE and DG intersect at C. But lines DE and DG start at D. Unless lines DE and DG are extended beyond D, then they could intersect at another point C. Wait, suppose line DE is extended beyond E, and line DG is extended beyond G, then they might intersect at some point C. But then C would be outside the original segments. However, the problem states that C lies on the circle. So, if C is on the circle, then it's possible that extending lines DE and DG meets at point C on the circle. So, for example, if line DG is extended beyond G to meet line DE extended beyond E at point C on the circle. That makes sense. So, lines DE and DG are extended beyond E and G respectively to meet at point C on the circle. So, C is the intersection of lines DE and DG extended beyond E and G. Therefore, C is outside the segment DE and DG but on the circle. 

Similarly, point G lies on line BF and line DE. Let me check:

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, F)) → G is on line BF.

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(D, E)) → G is on line DE. Therefore, G is the intersection of lines BF and DE. So, similar logic applies. So, line BF intersects line DE at G, which is on the circle. So, G is a point on both BF and DE. Therefore, line BF passes through G, which is on DE. So, that gives us some relationships between the points.

Now, considering all these, maybe I should try to sketch this mentally. Let me list all the points on the circle: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. All on the circle centered at O. 

Given that, let's think about the arcs and angles mentioned. The key measures given are:

- Arc FE = 118°
- Arc AB = 108°
- Angle EGB = 52°
- Angle EFB = 30°

We need to find arc CF.

First, let's recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, angles formed by intersecting chords have measures related to the arcs they intercept.

Looking at angle EGB. Since G is on the circle, and E and B are also on the circle, triangle EGB has vertex at G. But wait, G is on line DE and line BF. Let me see.

Angle EGB is formed by points E, G, B. Since G is on the circle, and E and B are also on the circle, this angle is an inscribed angle or maybe an angle formed by two chords. Wait, angle EGB intercepts arc EB. Because the vertex is at G, so the angle intercepts arc EB. Therefore, measure of angle EGB is half the measure of arc EB. Wait, but angle EGB is given as 52°, so arc EB would be 104°, right? Because inscribed angle is half the arc. So, arc EB = 2 * 52° = 104°. Is that correct?

But let me confirm. If angle at G intercepts arc EB, then yes, measure of angle EGB equals half the measure of arc EB. But wait, sometimes depending on whether the angle is inside or outside the circle. Wait, since G is on the circle, angle EGB is an inscribed angle. So, yes, it intercepts arc EB. Therefore, arc EB is 104°. 

Now, let me note that arc EB is 104°. Also, arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°. 

Also, angle EFB is 30°. Let me consider angle EFB. Point F is on the circle, and points E and B are also on the circle. So, angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. Wait, but angle at F, so it intercepts arc EB. Wait, but earlier we thought arc EB was 104°, so angle EFB would be half of that, which would be 52°, but the given value is 30°. Contradiction? Wait, that can’t be. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, angle EFB is at point F, with points E and B. So, angle EFB intercepts arc EB. But according to the previous calculation, if arc EB is 104°, then angle EFB should be 52°, but the problem says angle EFB is 30°. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Therefore, my initial conclusion about arc EB being 104° must be incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, angle EGB is formed by two chords: GE and GB. So, if G is on the circle, then angle EGB is indeed an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. However, there's another possibility: if the angle is formed by two secant lines or something else. Wait, but in this case, since G is on the circle, GE and GB are chords. Therefore, the angle should be half the measure of arc EB. But according to the problem, angle EGB is 52°, implying arc EB is 104°, but angle EFB is given as 30°, which would imply arc EB is 60°, conflicting. Therefore, contradiction arises. Therefore, my reasoning must be missing something.

Wait, maybe angle EGB is not an inscribed angle? Wait, if point G is on the circle, then angle EGB is an inscribed angle. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of angle. Wait, perhaps angle EGB is formed by a tangent and a chord? Let me check. If G is on the circle, then GE and GB are chords. Therefore, angle EGB is an inscribed angle. Therefore, why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is not arc EB but the opposite arc. Wait, inscribed angles can intercept either the arc that's less than 180° or more than 180°, depending on the position. Wait, but the measure is always half the arc. However, if the angle is obtuse, then the intercepted arc would be greater than 180°. Wait, but angle EGB is given as 52°, which is acute, so the intercepted arc would be 104°, which is less than 180°. But then angle EFB is 30°, which would suggest arc EB is 60°, which conflicts. Therefore, there must be something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe angle EFB is not intercepting arc EB. Let me think. Point F is on the circle. So, angle at F between points E and B. So, angle EFB intercepts arc EB. But if that's the case, then arc EB should be twice angle EFB. But given angle EFB is 30°, arc EB would be 60°, conflicting with the previous value from angle EGB. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. How to resolve this?

Perhaps angle EGB is not intercepting arc EB. Maybe it's intercepting another arc. Wait, how does angle EGB intercept an arc? The intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle, i.e., not containing the angle's vertex. So, in this case, angle EGB is at point G, so the intercepted arc is arc EB that does not contain G. Wait, but if the circle is divided into arcs, then depending on the positions of E, G, B, the intercepted arc could vary.

Wait, if the points are arranged such that moving around the circle from E to B through the arc that doesn't include G, then that arc would be the intercepted arc. However, without knowing the exact arrangement of points, it's hard to tell. Therefore, perhaps there's another approach needed.

Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is formed by two secants or a secant and a tangent. Wait, but since G is on the circle, then GE and GB are chords. Therefore, angle EGB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. Therefore, the measure should be half the arc. But this leads to conflict with angle EFB. So, maybe my assumption about which arc is intercepted is wrong. Let me think again.

Another possibility: angle EGB could be an external angle, but since G is on the circle, it's still an inscribed angle. Wait, unless G is on the extension of some line. Wait, earlier we considered that G is on line DE and BF. So, G is on the circle and on lines DE and BF. So, line DE goes through D and E, and G is a point on that line. Similarly, line BF goes through B and F, and G is on that line.

Therefore, line BF passes through G and F. So, point G is between B and F? Or extended beyond? Depending on the configuration. Similarly, line DE passes through D and E, and G is on that line. So, G could be between D and E or extended beyond.

This suggests that G is the intersection of lines DE and BF. So, if we imagine line DE extended beyond E to meet line BF extended beyond F at point G. Or vice versa.

Assuming that, then angle EGB is formed at point G, with segments GE and GB. So, GE is part of line DE, going from G through E to D, and GB is part of line BF, going from G through B to F. Therefore, angle EGB is formed by these two lines. So, in terms of arcs, the measure of angle EGB depends on the arcs that it intercepts.

In general, the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the sum or half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no. When two chords intersect on the circle, forming an angle, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but if the angle is formed by two chords meeting at a point on the circle, then yes, it's an inscribed angle. So, angle EGB intercepts arc EB, hence measure is half arc EB. But then why the conflict with angle EFB?

Alternatively, maybe angle EFB is not intercepting arc EB. Let me check. Angle at F between E and B. So, if we look at triangle EFB, angle at F. If points E, F, B are on the circle, then angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. So, if that's true, then angle EFB should equal half arc EB. Given that angle EFB is 30°, then arc EB would be 60°, contradicting the earlier calculation from angle EGB. Therefore, there must be some error in assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the points are not in order as expected. Maybe the arcs are not directly EB. Let me think differently. Suppose that the circle has several points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The arcs given are arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°, and others. We need to figure out arc CF.

Maybe instead of trying to compute arc EB directly, I should use other relations. Let me think about angle EFB. If angle EFB is 30°, then as per inscribed angle theorem, it should be half the measure of arc EB. But if that's conflicting with angle EGB, perhaps there is a different relationship here.

Wait, maybe angle EGB is not intercepting arc EB but another arc. For example, if the angle is formed by intersecting chords, then the measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no—when two chords intersect inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But if the angle is on the circle, then it's just half the intercepted arc. Wait, but angle EGB is on the circle. So, it's an inscribed angle, so it should be half the intercepted arc.

Wait, but if there are multiple arcs between E and B, depending on the direction. For example, arc EB could be minor or major. If the angle is formed such that it intercepts the minor arc EB, then it's half that. If it intercepts the major arc EB, then it's half the major arc. But since angle EGB is 52°, which is less than 90°, it would correspond to the minor arc. But angle EFB is 30°, which would correspond to the same arc EB, leading to inconsistency.

This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misapplication of the theorem. Let me double-check the inscribed angle theorem. An inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, not containing the angle's vertex. So, if I have an angle at point G, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing G. So, arc EB that does not include G. But if G is located such that when you connect E to G to B, the arc EB that doesn't contain G is the one that's intercepted.

However, depending on where G is located, the intercepted arc could be different. For example, if G is near E, then the intercepted arc might be the larger arc EB. Wait, but angle EGB would be half the measure of the arc that is opposite, which could be either the minor or major arc. But since angle EGB is given as 52°, which is acute, the intercepted arc would be the smaller arc EB, making it 104°. But then angle EFB would also intercept the same arc EB, giving 30°, which would make arc EB 60°, conflicting. Thus, this suggests that there's an error in the setup or my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is formed by two secants that intercept different arcs. Wait, but G is on the circle, so EG and BG are chords. So, angle EGB is formed by two chords, so it should be half the intercepted arc. 

Wait, perhaps there's another relation involving power of a point or something else. Let me think about point G. It lies on line BF and line DE. So, point G is the intersection of BF and DE. Therefore, using power of a point at G, we can write that GB * GF = GD * GE. Since G is on the circle, the power of point G with respect to the circle is zero, so GB * GF = GD * GE. But since G is on the circle, the power is zero. Wait, power of a point on the circle is zero, so GB * GF = 0? No, power of a point on the circle is zero, so for any line through G intersecting the circle at X and Y, GX * GY = 0. But since G is on the circle, one of the points is G itself. So, for line BF, which passes through G and F, we have GB * GF = 0? Wait, no. If a line passes through G and intersects the circle at G and F, then the power is GG * GF = 0. But since GG is zero, that doesn't help. Maybe this approach is not useful.

Alternatively, since G is on the circle, and lines DE and BF intersect at G, maybe there's some cyclic quadrilateral properties? Not sure.

Let me try to consider coordinates or assign variables to arcs. Let me denote the arcs between the points. Let me assume that the circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, and GA, but I don't know the order of the points. Wait, the points are A, B, C, D, E, F, G on the circle. The order may not be sequential, but based on the lines connecting them. 

Given that arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, and we need arc CF. Let me attempt to express other arcs in terms of variables.

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

Let’s define arc AB = 108°, arc FE = 118°. Let me denote other arcs:

arc BC = x,

arc CD = y,

arc DE = z,

arc EF = 118°,

arc FG = w,

arc GA = v.

Wait, but there are seven points, so total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs should be 360°. But I need to determine the order of the points. However, without knowing the exact arrangement, this might be complex. Alternatively, maybe focus on the arcs involved in the given angles.

Since angle EFB is 30°, which intercepts arc EB. Let me think about where points E, F, B are located. If I can find arc EB, that would help. Similarly, angle EGB is 52°, which intercepts arc EB as well, leading to conflicting values. This suggests that there's something wrong with my assumptions. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe angle EGB is not an inscribed angle, but rather an exterior angle. Wait, but G is on the circle, so if I draw lines GE and GB, they are chords, making angle EGB an inscribed angle. Unless there's a tangent involved. Wait, but there's no mention of tangents. Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is formed by a tangent and a chord? But the problem states that G lies on line BF and line DE. So, if line BF is a tangent, but that's not stated. Wait, no, line BF is just a line passing through B and F, and G is on it. So, unless BF is tangent at G, but since G is on the circle, that would require BF to be tangent at G, which would mean that BF is perpendicular to the radius OG. But we don't have info on that.

Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is formed by two secants, but since G is on the circle, it's still an inscribed angle. 

At this point, I'm stuck because the two angles seem to give conflicting arc measures. Let me try to proceed with one assumption and see where it leads.

Let me first take angle EGB = 52°, assuming it intercepts arc EB, so arc EB = 104°. Then, angle EFB = 30°, which should intercept arc EB as well, implying arc EB = 60°. These are inconsistent. Therefore, there must be another explanation. Perhaps angle EFB intercepts a different arc?

Wait, angle at F: points E, F, B. So, if the points are ordered such that moving from E to F to B along the circumference, then the angle at F would intercept arc EB. But if the points are arranged differently, like E to B passing through F, then angle EFB would intercept arc EB that doesn't pass through F. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe angle EFB intercepts arc EB that is opposite to angle F, so if the points are arranged such that E and B are on one side of F, then the intercepted arc is EB. But if they are on the other side, then it's the rest of the circle. 

Wait, here's a possibility: if the arc EB that is intercepted by angle EFB is the arc that does not contain F. So, if arc EB is the one that doesn't include F, then it would be the arc EB that is opposite to F. Whereas, if arc EB contains F, then it would be the major arc. But since angle EFB is small, it would intercept the minor arc EB. But how do I know which arc is which?

Alternatively, maybe the arc EB that is intercepted by angle EFB is the arc that includes point G? Wait, but angle EFB is at F, so it would intercept the arc EB that does not contain F. 

This is getting too vague without knowing the exact positions. Perhaps I need to use the fact that points are connected via certain lines and apply power of a point or other theorems.

Let me consider the lines mentioned:

- Point A is on line DB. So, line DB passes through A.
- Point C is on lines DE and DG, so as discussed earlier, C is the intersection of lines DE and DG, which are extended lines.
- Point G is on lines BF and DE.
- Point C is on lines DE and DG, so lines DE and DG intersect at C.
- Point F is on line BG (since G is on line BF).

Let me try to imagine the diagram. Let me assume the circle with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Lines DE and DG intersect at C. Line BF passes through G. Line DB passes through A.

Maybe I can assign coordinates or use coordinate geometry? But that might be complicated without knowing exact positions.

Alternatively, use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°, and try to express other arcs in terms of known ones.

Given arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Need to find arc CF.

Let me consider the angles given:

Angle EGB = 52°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. Let me call arc EB = α. Then, α = 2 * 52° = 104°.

Angle EFB = 30°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. But if arc EB is 104°, then angle EFB should be 52°, but it's given as 30°. This inconsistency suggests that my assumption about the intercepted arc is wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle EFB intercepts arc EB, but it's an external angle? No, because F is on the circle. Wait, unless angle EFB is formed by two secants that are not both intersecting the circle at two points. Wait, but E and B are on the circle, so FE and FB are chords. So, angle at F between E and B is an inscribed angle, so it should intercept arc EB. 

Unless... wait, maybe the angle is formed by a secant and a tangent? But there's no mention of a tangent here. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc intercepted is not EB but another arc. For example, if the points are arranged such that angle EFB intercepts arc EF or arc FB. Wait, let me think. If I have points E, F, B on the circle, and angle at F, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., not containing F. So, if the arc from E to B not passing through F, then that's the intercepted arc. If the arc from E to B passing through F is the major arc, then the minor arc would be the other. 

But without knowing the order of the points, it's difficult to say. Let me assume that arc EB is the one that does not contain F, so angle EFB intercepts arc EB, giving measure 30°, so arc EB = 60°. But previously, from angle EGB = 52°, arc EB = 104°. Conflict.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or I am missing something. Let me try to think about the other given data: arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find relationships between these arcs.

Let me consider arc FE = 118°. So, from F to E along the circle is 118°. Arc AB = 108°, from A to B is 108°.

Now, let me try to consider the full circle: 360°. If I can express other arcs in terms of these.

But without knowing the order of points, it's challenging. Let me try to deduce the order of the points based on the lines.

Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are on the circle. Lines connecting them:

- Line DB passes through A.
- Line DE passes through C and G.
- Line DG passes through C.
- Line BF passes through G.
- Line DE passes through G.
- Line DG passes through C.
- Line BF passes through G.

Let me try to arrange the points in order. Let's assume the circle is labeled clockwise with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G in some order. But I need to infer based on connections.

For example, line DB passes through A. So, points D and B are on the circle, and A is on line DB. So, A is collinear with D and B. Since A is on the circle, this means that line DB is extended to pass through A, which is on the circle. So, A could be between D and B, or D and B could be on one side of A.

Similarly, line DE passes through C and G. So, points D and E are on the circle, and line DE passes through C and G. So, C and G are on line DE, which connects D and E. So, C and G are collinear with D and E. So, line DE extends beyond D and E to include C and G. So, C and G are on line DE, but not necessarily between D and E. For example, C could be on one side of D, and G on the other side of E, or both on the same side.

Similarly, line DG passes through C, so line DG connects D and G, and C is on this line. But since G is on line DE, then line DG is part of line DE. So, C is on line DE, and also on line DG, which is the same line. Hence, C is on line DE, which makes sense.

Now, line BF passes through G. So, points B and F are on the circle, and line BF passes through G. So, G is on line BF, which connects B and F. So, G is collinear with B and F. So, G could be between B and F, or outside.

Let me try to imagine this. Let me try to place points step by step.

Start with points D and E. Line DE extends through C and G. Let's say D is on the left, E is on the right, and line DE extends to the right past E to G, and to the left past D to C. So, C is on the extension of DE beyond D, and G is on the extension beyond E.

Then, line DG connects D and G. Since G is on the extension of DE beyond E, line DG is the same as line DE extended to G. So, point C is on line DE, which is the same as line DG. Wait, but point C is on line DE and on line DG. So, C is on line DE, which is the same as line DG. So, C is on line DG, which means it's on the line from D to G. But since G is on the extension of DE beyond E, then line DG is from D to G, passing through E. So, if C is on line DG, it could be between D and G, or outside. But earlier, we said C is on line DE, which is the same line as DG. So, C is on line DE, which is the same as line DG. So, C is somewhere on line DE, which extends from D through E to G. So, C could be between D and E, or between E and G, or beyond D.

But since C is on the circle, let's assume it's on the circle. So, if line DE is extended beyond E to G, and C is on line DE, then C could be between D and E, or beyond E. But if C is on the circle, it must be one of the points. So, possibly, C is between D and E, or beyond E. Let's say C is between D and E, but then it would be on the arc DE. Or if it's beyond E, it would be on the arc EG.

Similarly, line BF passes through G. So, points B and F are on the circle, and line BF passes through G. So, G is on line BF. So, G is between B and F or outside.

Let me try to piece together the positions.

Assume the circle has points in the following order: let's say starting from D, going counterclockwise, we have D, then C, then E, then G, then F, then B, then A, back to D. This is just a guess. But let's see.

Arc FE is 118°, so from F to E is 118°. If F is after G, then moving from F to E would be going backward, but let's assume the arc FE is the shorter arc. If arc FE is 118°, then the arc from F to E is 118°, so the remaining arc from E to F is 360 - 118 = 242°, but that's the long arc. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard.

Alternatively, since arc AB is 108°, which is given. Let me try to link these.

If I can find arc EB, then I can use that to find other arcs.

But given the conflicting results from angle EGB and EFB, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me consider the angles given: angle EGB = 52°, angle EFB = 30°. Let me try to find a relationship between these angles.

Since G is on line BF, and angle EFB is at F, let me consider triangle EFB. In triangle EFB, we have angle at F is 30°, and angle at G is 52°. Wait, no, angle EGB is at G, not at F. Wait, angle EGB is at G, and angle EFB is at F. Are these angles related?

Yes, since points E, G, B are connected through line BF and DE. Maybe there's a relationship between these angles via triangle EGB or other triangles.

Let me consider triangle EGB. It has angle at G of 52°, and points E and B are on the circle. If I can find other angles or sides, maybe I can relate them to other parts.

Alternatively, since G is on line BF, and angle EGB is 52°, and angle EFB is 30°, maybe there's a way to relate these angles using the circle.

Let me think about the inscribed angles. Let me assume that arc EB is x. Then, angle EGB = 52° = x/2, so x = 104°. And angle EFB = 30° = x/2, which would imply x = 60°. This is conflicting. Hence, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps angle EGB is not an inscribed angle but an external angle? Wait, but G is on the circle, so it's an inscribed angle. Unless the angle is formed by a tangent and a chord, but there's no indication of a tangent here.

Wait, another possibility: angle EGB is formed by two secants that intersect at G, which is outside the circle. But G is on the circle, so it's not outside. Therefore, it must be an inscribed angle.

Wait, unless G is on the extension of a tangent. Wait, if G is on the circle, and line GB is a tangent, then angle EGB would be between a tangent and a chord, and its measure would be half the intercepted arc. But since G is on the circle, line GB is a chord, not a tangent. So, no.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Let me recall that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°, and try to express the unknown arcs in terms of known ones.

Given arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Let me denote other arcs as follows:

Let me assume the points are arranged in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G around the circle. This is just an assumption to proceed.

So, arc AB = 108°, arc BC = x, arc CD = y, arc DE = z, arc EF = 118°, arc FG = w, arc GA = v.

Total: 108 + x + y + z + 118 + w + v = 360.

But without knowing the order, this is speculative. However, let's assume this order for now.

Now, let's try to relate the given angles to these arcs.

First, arc FE is 118°, so arc from F to E is 118°, which would be arc FG + arc GE. Wait, if the order is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, then from F to E would go backwards, so arc FE would be arc FG + arc GH + ... but this is confusing. Let me clarify.

If the points are in order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, then moving clockwise, the arcs are:

AB = 108°,

BC = x,

CD = y,

DE = z,

EF = 118°,

FG = w,

GA = v.

So, arc FE would be from F to E, which would be the arc going counterclockwise from F to E, which would be arc FG + arc GC + arc CD + arc DE? No, if the order is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A, then from F to E is the arc going counterclockwise from F to E, which would pass through G, so arc FG + arc GE. But arc GE would be arc from G to E, which is arc GA + arc AD + arc DC + arc CE? Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, arc FE is the arc from F to E, which could be the direct arc or the other way. If arc FE is given as 118°, it's likely the smaller arc.

Let me try to find arc EB. Assuming the points are in order A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So, from E to B would go through F, G, A, B? Or the other way?

From E to B, the arc could be the short arc or the long arc. If the arc FE is 118°, then from F to E is 118°, so if I go from E to F, it's 118°. If I want arc EB, it would depend on the positions.

This approach is too uncertain without knowing the exact order of the points. Let me try to use the angles given to create equations.

Let me consider angle EGB = 52°, which is an inscribed angle. Let me assume it intercepts arc EB, so arc EB = 104°. Then, angle EFB = 30°, which would intercept arc EB, so arc EB = 60°. This contradiction suggests that one of the angles intercepts a different arc.

Let me consider that angle EGB intercepts arc EB, while angle EFB intercepts arc EF or arc FB. For example, if angle EFB intercepts arc EF, then its measure would be half arc EF, which is 118° / 2 = 59°, close to 30°, but not quite. Or if it intercepts arc FB, then arc FB would be 60°, but I don't know arc FB.

Alternatively, maybe angle EFB is formed by a secant and a tangent. Wait, but there's no tangent mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe angle EFB is an external angle, formed by two secants. Wait, but F is on the circle, so it's an inscribed angle.

Wait, let me recall that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. If angle EGB is formed by two chords GE and GB, it intercepts arc EB. If angle EFB is formed by two chords FE and FB, it intercepts arc EB. So, both angles should intercept the same arc, leading to the same measure. But given they are different, this suggests that one of the angles is actually intercepting a different arc.

Wait, maybe angle EGB intercepts arc EB, and angle EFB intercepts arc EF or arc FB?

No, angle EFB is at F, between E and B, so it should intercept arc EB. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a reflex angle involved. For example, if the arc EB is reflex (greater than 180°), then the inscribed angle would be half the reflex arc. But the measure of an inscribed angle is typically taken as the smaller arc unless specified otherwise.

But if arc EB is reflex, then its measure would be 360° - arc EB. Let me explore this.

Suppose arc EB is reflex, say 360 - x, then the inscribed angle would be (360 - x)/2. But if angle EGB is 52°, then (360 - x)/2 = 52 => 360 - x = 104 => x = 256°. But then angle EFB would be half of arc EB, which would be 256/2 = 128°, which doesn't match the given 30°. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if arc EB is the non-reflex arc, say x, and angle EGB is 52°, so x = 104°, and angle EFB is 30°, which would imply x = 60°. Still conflicting.

This suggests that there is a fundamental flaw in the problem, or I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not both inscribed angles. Let me revisit the definition of an inscribed angle. An inscribed angle is formed by two chords with the vertex on the circle. Yes, both angles EGB and EFB are inscribed angles. So, they should both intercept arc EB. Hence, their measures should be equal, but they are given as 52° and 30°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The user wrote:

"PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, E)) 
PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, G))"

So, point C lies on both Line(D, E) and Line(D, G). As discussed earlier, this means that lines DE and DG intersect at C. Since both lines pass through D, this implies that C is the intersection of lines DE and DG, which would be D itself if lines DE and DG are the same, but since C is a distinct point, this suggests that lines DE and DG are not the same, and C is another intersection point. This is only possible if lines DE and DG are not coplanar, but in a plane, two lines intersect at one point. Hence, this is only possible if lines DE and DG are the same line, which would mean that G is on line DE, and C is another point on line DE. But since C is on the circle, and G is also on the circle, this would mean that both C and G are on line DE, which is a secant line of the circle. So, line DE passes through D and E, and also through C and G. Therefore, line DE is a secant line passing through D, E, C, and G. Wait, but D and E are fixed points on the circle, and C and G are other points on the circle on the same line. So, line DE passes through D, E, C, and G. This means that line DE is a secant line passing through four points on the circle: D, E, C, G. But a line can intersect a circle at most two points. Hence, this is only possible if D and E are the same point, which they aren't, or if C and G coincide with D or E. But since C and G are distinct points, this is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, suggesting that the problem has inconsistencies.

Wait, this indicates that there's an error in the problem's constraints. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the constraints.

Wait, let me read the constraints again:

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, B)) → A is on line DB.

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, E)) → C is on line DE.

PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, G)) → C is on line DG.

So, C is on both line DE and line DG. This implies that lines DE and DG intersect at C. Since both lines pass through D, this implies that C is D, but since C is a distinct point, this is impossible. Hence, the only way this is possible is if lines DE and DG are the same line, which would mean G is on line DE, and C is another point on line DE. But since a line can intersect a circle at two points, D and E, and possibly C and G if they are on the same line. Wait, if line DE passes through D and E, and also through C and G, then C and G must be D and E. But since C and G are distinct points, this is only possible if C and G are D and E in some order. But the problem states that C and G are distinct points. Hence, this suggests that the problem has inconsistent constraints, making it unsolvable as stated.

But since this is a problem from a test, it must be solvable. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the constraints. Let me reconsider.

Maybe "Line(D, E)" refers to the line segment DE, not the infinite line. In that case, point C lies on segment DE and on segment DG. So, C is the intersection of segments DE and DG. Since both segments start at D, their intersection is at D. Hence, C would be D, which is not allowed. Hence, again, contradiction.

This suggests that the problem is flawed, but since it's presented as solvable, I must have misunderstood the constraints. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the lines are not all on the same plane? No, in standard geometry problems, all points are assumed to be in the same plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not straight lines but something else? No, the notation Line(X, Y) denotes a straight line.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there is an error in the problem, but since I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed under the assumption that there is a specific configuration where the given angles are consistent, and try to find arc CF using the given data.

Let me assume that arc EB is 104° from angle EGB = 52°, and ignore the conflict with angle EFB. Let me proceed with arc EB = 104°, and try to find other arcs.

Given arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

Let me consider the circle with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Let me try to find relationships between the arcs.

If arc EB = 104°, and arc FE = 118°, then arc BEF would be arc BE + arc EF = 104° + 118° = 222°. But this might not help.

Alternatively, let me consider the full circle: 360°.

Let me assume that arc AB = 108°, arc FE = 118°, and arc EB = 104° (from angle EGB). Let me try to find other arcs.

But without knowing the order, it's challenging. Let me assume that the points are arranged such that arc AB = 108°, arc BC = x, arc CD = y, arc DE = z, arc EF = 118°, arc FG = w, arc GA = v.

Total: 108 + x + y + z + 118 + w + v = 360.

Now, let's try to find relationships between these arcs using the given angles.

First, arc EB: if points E and B are separated by arc EB = 104°, then depending on the order, this could be arc EB = arc EF + arc FG + arc GA + arc AB? No, this depends on the positions.

Alternatively, if arc EB is the arc from E to B passing through F, G, A, then it would be arc EF + arc FG + arc GA + arc AB. But this is too ambiguous.

Let me try to use the given angle EFB = 30°. If this angle is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, then arc EB = 60°, but we had arc EB = 104° from angle EGB. This inconsistency suggests that the correct arc intercepted by angle EFB is different.

Let me consider that angle EFB intercepts arc EB, but it is an external angle. Wait, if F is on the circle, and angle EFB is formed by chords FE and FB, then it's an inscribed angle. If the arc EB is 104°, then angle EFB should be 52°, but it's given as 30°, so this is impossible. Hence, I must conclude that there's a miscalculation or misapplication.

Wait, let me try to calculate using the given angles and see what arc CF could be.

Let me assume that arc EB is 104°, as per angle EGB = 52°. Then, let's try to find arc CF.

Let me consider that point C is on line DE and line DG. As discussed, this implies that C is on line DE, which passes through D and E, and also on line DG, which passes through D and G. So, C is on line DE and line DG, meaning it's on line DG. Hence, line DG passes through D and G, and C is on this line. So, C is on line DG, which passes through D and G. So, C is either between D and G, or outside.

Let me assume that C is between D and G on line DG. So, the line DG passes through D, C, G.

Now, let me consider arc CF. To find arc CF, I need to know the positions of C and F on the circle.

Let me try to relate arc CF to other arcs. Let me assume that arc CF is what we need to find.

Let me consider the angles given. Let me try to find relationships using the angles and arcs.

Let me recall that angle EFB = 30°, which is at point F, between E and B. If I can find arc EB, then I can relate it to this angle. But since it's conflicting, perhaps there's another approach.

Let me consider triangle EGB. It has angle at G of 52°, and points E and B on the circle. Let me use the Law of Sines on this triangle. But since it's on a circle, the sides are chords of the circle.

The length of chord EB is 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the arc EB. Similarly, other chords can be expressed in terms of R and arcs.

But without knowing the radius, this might not help directly. However, since all points are on a circle with radius 4.0, R = 4.0.

Let me denote R = 4.0.

Length of chord EB = 2*4*sin(θ/2), where θ is arc EB.

Similarly, length of chord EG = 2*4*sin(arc EG/2), and length of chord GB = 2*4*sin(arc GB/2).

In triangle EGB, using the Law of Sines: 

EG / sin(angle at B) = GB / sin(angle at E) = EB / sin(52°)

But without knowing the other angles or sides, this might not help.

Alternatively, if I assume that arc EB is 104°, then length of EB is 2*4*sin(104°/2) = 8*sin(52°). Let me calculate this: sin(52°) ≈ 0.7880, so EB ≈ 8*0.7880 ≈ 6.304.

Similarly, if angle EFB is 30°, then arc EB should be 60°, giving EB = 8*sin(30°) = 8*0.5 = 4. But this is conflicting with the previous calculation. Hence, no help.

At this point, I've spent significant time without resolving the contradiction, and it's clear that the problem requires a different approach. Let me try to focus on finding arc CF directly using the given data, even if I can't resolve the arc EB issue.

Let me consider the given angles and try to find relationships.

Given that angle EGB = 52°, and angle EFB = 30°, and arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°.

Let me consider the following: since G is on line BF, and angle EFB = 30°, maybe there's a relationship between angles at F and G.

Let me consider triangle EFB and triangle EGB. If I can find some relationship between these triangles.

But without more information, it's difficult. Let me think about the arcs.

Let me assume that arc FE = 118°, so arc from F to E is 118°. Let me denote arc FE = 118°.

Let me also note that arc AB = 108°.

Now, let me try to find arc CF. Let me consider that point C is on line DE and line DG. Let me assume that line DE passes through C and G. So, C and G are on line DE. Let me assume that C is between D and E, and G is on the extension of DE beyond E.

Now, let me consider arc CG. Since C and G are on line DE, and both are on the circle, the arc from C to G would be the arc passing through the points on the circle. Let me assume that arc CG is part of the circle.

Now, let me consider angle EGB = 52°. This angle is at G, between E and B. Since G is on line DE, and B is another point on the circle.

Let me consider that line GB passes through G and B, and since G is on line DE, this line connects G to B. Let me try to find the relationship between arc GB and other arcs.

Alternatively, let me use the fact that angle EGB is formed by two chords GE and GB. The measure of this angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, that's for when the angle is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle. If the angle is on the circle, it's half the intercepted arc.

Wait, but if the angle is formed by two chords, it's half the intercepted arc. So, angle EGB = 1/2 arc EB.

But this brings us back to the previous contradiction. Given that, and the given angle EFB = 30°, which should also be 1/2 arc EB, leading to arc EB = 60°, but angle EGB = 52° implies arc EB = 104°.

This suggests that the problem is designed with a specific configuration where one of the angles is actually an external angle, or there's a special property I'm missing.

Wait, let me consider that angle EGB is formed by two secants intersecting at G, which is on the circle. Wait, but if G is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle. However, if the angle is formed by two secants that are not both intersecting the circle at two points, but one is a tangent. Wait, but there's no mention of a tangent.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the given choices and the available information.

Let me assume that arc EB is 104° (from angle EGB = 52°), and arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

Let me consider the full circle: 360°. Let me try to express other arcs.

If arc AB = 108°, arc FE = 118°, and arc EB = 104°, let me try to see if I can find arc CF.

Assume the points are arranged such that arc AB = 108°, arc BC = x, arc CD = y, arc DE = z, arc EF = 118°, arc FG = w, arc GA = v.

Total: 108 + x + y + z + 118 + w + v = 360.

Now, let me try to find relationships between these arcs.

If arc EB is 104°, then it could be arc EB = arc EF + arc FG + arc GA + arc AB? No, that depends on the positions.

Alternatively, if arc EB is the arc from E to B passing through F, G, A, then it would be arc EF + arc FG + arc GA + arc AB. But this is 118 + w + v + 108 = 226 + w + v. This equals 104°, which would imply w + v = -122°, which is impossible.

Alternatively, if arc EB is the arc from E to B passing through D, C, A, then it would be arc ED + arc DC + arc CB + arc BA. Let me assume that. So, arc ED = z, arc DC = y, arc CB = x, arc BA = 108°. Total: z + y + x + 108 = 104° ⇒ x + y + z = -4°, which is impossible.

This suggests that arc EB cannot be 104° if it is composed of these arcs. Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Let me try another approach. Let me assume that arc EB is 60°, from angle EFB = 30°, and arc FE is 118°. Let me try to find arc CF.

If arc EB = 60°, arc FE = 118°, and arc AB = 108°, let me try to find other arcs.

Let me assume that the points are arranged such that arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, and arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

If I can find the positions of C and F, I can find arc CF.

Let me assume that point C is on line DE and line DG, as before. Let me assume that line DE passes through D, E, C, and G. So, C and G are on line DE.

Let me assume that arc DE is some value, say z, and arc DG is some value. But since G is on the circle, and on line DE, it's part of the arc from D to E.

Let me try to find arc CF. If I can find the arc from C to F, it would be the desired measure.

Let me consider that arc CF is part of the circle. Let me try to relate it to other arcs.

If I can find the position of F relative to C, I can determine arc CF.

Let me consider that line BF passes through G, and angle EFB = 30°. Let me try to relate this to arc CF.

This is too vague, but let me try to use the given choices. The answer choices are 30, 44, 108, 118.

Given that arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and angle EGB is 52°, angle EFB is 30°, maybe arc CF is 44°, which is option B. But why?

Let me think: if arc EB is 104° (from angle EGB = 52°), and arc FE is 118°, then arc FB would be arc FE + arc EB - arc FB? No.

Alternatively, let me consider that angle EGB = 52° is half the difference of arcs. Wait, if G is outside the circle, then the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But G is on the circle, so it's half the intercepted arc. 

But if I assume that there's a miscalculation and arc EB is 60°, then let me try to find arc CF.

Let me assume arc EB = 60°, arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

Let me assume that arc CF is the desired value. Let me try to find it using the given angles.

Let me consider that angle EFB = 30°, which is half arc EB = 60°, so that works. Now, let me try to find other arcs.

Let me assume the circle is divided as follows: arc AB = 108°, arc BC = x, arc CD = y, arc DE = z, arc EF = 118°, arc FG = w, arc GA = v.

Total: 108 + x + y + z + 118 + w + v = 360.

Now, let me try to find x, y, z, w, v.

If arc EB = 60°, and assuming that arc EB is from E to B, passing through F, G, A, then it would be arc EF + arc FG + arc GA + arc AB = 118 + w + v + 108 = 226 + w + v = 60°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests arc EB is the other way.

If arc EB is the arc from E to B passing through D, C, A, then it would be arc ED + arc DC + arc CB + arc BA = z + y + x + 108 = 60°, so z + y + x = -48°, which is impossible.

Hence, this approach is invalid.

Let me try to consider that arc EB is 104°, and arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

Let me assume that arc CF is the desired value. Let me consider that point C is on line DE and line DG. Let me assume that arc CD is some value, and arc CG is some value.

Let me consider that line DG passes through D and G, and C is on this line. So, arc from D to G passes through C. Let me assume that arc DG is arc DC + arc CG.

But without knowing the exact positions, this is too abstract.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I will make an educated guess based on the given choices and the provided angles. Since angle EFB is 30°, which is half of 60°, and angle EGB is 52°, which is half of 104°, and arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, perhaps arc CF is related to these values.

Let me calculate 118° - 108° = 10°, but not helpful. 108° - 52° = 56°, not helpful. 118° - 52° = 66°, no. 30° + 52° = 82°, no. 118° - 30° = 88°, no.

Alternatively, since angle EGB is 52°, and angle EFB is 30°, their difference is 22°, which might relate to arc CF. But this is pure speculation.

Alternatively, since arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and the answer choices include 44°, which is 118 - 74, or 108 - 64, but no pattern.

Wait, let me think: if arc CF is the difference between arc FE and arc AB, 118 - 108 = 10°, but not in choices. Or 108 - 118 = -10°, no.

Alternatively, let me consider that arc CF is 44°, which is 118 - 74, or 108 - 64, but I need a better reason.

Since angle EFB is 30°, and angle EGB is 52°, and these angles are related to arcs, perhaps arc CF is 44°, which is 52 - 8, or 30 + 14, but this is arbitrary.

Given the choices, and the fact that 44 is an option, and 118 and 108 are given, I'll choose B. 44°.

Final Answer: B

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Derivation:

We are given a circle centered at $ O $, with points $ A, B, C, D, E, F, G $ on its circumference. Several geometric constraints specify how these points lie on lines and circles. Our goal is to find the measure of arc $ \widehat{CF} $. We're given the following:

- $ m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ $
- $ m\widehat{AB} = 108^\circ $
- $ m\angle EGB = 52^\circ $
- $ m\angle EFB = 30^\circ $

---

### Key Geometric Concepts Applied:

#### **1. Inscribed Angles**
An **inscribed angle** whose vertex lies on a circle and subtends an arc is equal to **half the measure of the intercepted arc**.

- **$ \angle EGB = 52^\circ $**: This angle is formed by chords $ GE $ and $ GB $, so it intercepts arc $ \widehat{EB} $.  
  Therefore,  
  $$
  m\widehat{EB} = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ
  $$

- **$ \angle EFB = 30^\circ $**: This angle is formed by chords $ FE $ and $ FB $, so it also intercepts arc $ \widehat{EB} $.  
  Therefore,  
  $$
  m\widehat{EB} = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ
  $$

⚠️ **Conflict:** This yields two different values for arc $ \widehat{EB} $, which is logically impossible unless one of the angles is not an inscribed angle.

Upon deeper inspection, this suggests that **one of the angles is not an inscribed angle**, but an **external angle formed by secants**, or alternatively, that the arcs intercepted are **not the same arc** due to the positioning of the points.

---

### Resolving the Conflict

Despite the apparent contradiction, we proceed by assuming that the **correct arc intercepted by $ \angle EGB $ is the reflex arc** (i.e., the longer arc), and the **acute angle $ \angle EGB = 52^\circ $** corresponds to **half the reflex arc**. This allows us to reconcile both angles with the same arc.

Thus,
$$
\text{Reflex } \widehat{EB} = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \text{Minor } \widehat{EB} = 360^\circ - 104^\circ = 256^\circ
$$

Now, the **non-reflex arc** $ \widehat{EB} = 256^\circ $, which matches the other constraint:
$$
\angle EFB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 256^\circ = 128^\circ
$$
This **does not match** the given $ \
