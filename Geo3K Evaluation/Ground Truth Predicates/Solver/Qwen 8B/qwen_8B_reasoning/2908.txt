MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

- The length of line KM is 20 units.
- Length of LK is z.
- Length of LM is x.
- Length of JM is 5 units.
- Length of LJ is y.
- Point M lies on line KJ.
- Lines KM and LM are perpendicular.
- Lines LK and LJ are perpendicular.

So, points K, M, J are connected such that M is on line KJ. Also, KM is perpendicular to LM. And LK is perpendicular to LJ. Interesting. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Let me start by considering coordinates. Since there are several right angles involved, coordinate geometry might help here. Let me assign coordinates to points to make it easier.

First, since KM and LM are perpendicular, maybe I can set up a coordinate system where point M is at the origin? Wait, but also, point M lies on line KJ. So perhaps setting up coordinates with M as the origin?

Alternatively, maybe place point M at (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since KM is perpendicular to LM, which would mean that lines KM and LM form a right angle at M. Let me think.

Let me consider point M as the origin (0, 0). Now, since KM is a line segment of length 20, and since KM is perpendicular to LM, then if I take KM along some axis, say the x-axis, then LM would be along the y-axis.

Wait, suppose point K is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s assume M is at (0, 0). Since KM is perpendicular to LM, so if KM is horizontal, then LM is vertical. Let me define:

Let’s take line KM as horizontal. Therefore, point K is along the x-axis. Suppose point M is at (0, 0), so point K could be at (-a, 0) for some a, making KM have length a. But given that KM is 20, then a = 20. So point K would be at (-20, 0), and M at (0, 0).

Now, since LM is perpendicular to KM, which is horizontal, so LM must be vertical. Therefore, point L is somewhere along the vertical line passing through M. Wait, but LM is a line segment from L to M. If LM is vertical, then L has coordinates (0, b) for some b. But wait, we also know that point M lies on line KJ. So line KJ passes through M. Since K is at (-20, 0) and M is at (0, 0), then line KJ is the same as line KM extended. Wait, no, because point J is another point on line KJ. Wait, point M is on line KJ, so line KJ goes through K, M, and J. So J is another point on that line. Given that JM is 5 units. So JM is the distance from J to M, which is 5. Since M is between K and J? Or maybe J is on the other side of M relative to K?

Let me clarify. If line KJ has points K, M, J in order, then JM would be part of that line. But since M is on line KJ, J could be either extending beyond M away from K or towards K. However, given that JM is 5, and KM is 20, depending on the position of J.

But let's proceed. Let me fix coordinates:

Set M at (0, 0). K is at (-20, 0). Line KJ passes through K, M, and J. So J is somewhere on the line extending from K through M. Let me assume that J is on the opposite side of M from K. So from K(-20, 0), going through M(0, 0), then J would be at (c, 0) where c > 0. Then JM is the distance from J(c, 0) to M(0, 0) which is |c| = 5. So c = 5. Therefore, J is at (5, 0). Wait, but then JM is 5 units. That seems straightforward.

So coordinates:

- K: (-20, 0)

- M: (0, 0)

- J: (5, 0)

Because JM is 5 units. So that makes sense. Now, point L is such that LM is vertical (since KM is horizontal and they are perpendicular). So LM is vertical, meaning point L is somewhere along the y-axis. Because LM connects L to M(0,0), so if LM is vertical, then L has coordinates (0, d) for some d. Let me denote L as (0, d).

Now, we also know that lines LK and LJ are perpendicular. Let's check that. First, find coordinates of L, K, J.

LK is the line from L(0, d) to K(-20, 0). The slope of LK is (0 - d)/(-20 - 0) = (-d)/(-20) = d/20.

Similarly, LJ is the line from L(0, d) to J(5, 0). The slope of LJ is (0 - d)/(5 - 0) = -d/5.

Since these two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. Therefore:

(d/20) * (-d/5) = -1

Compute left-hand side:

(-d²)/100 = -1

Multiply both sides by -1:

d² / 100 = 1 → d² = 100 → d = ±10.

Therefore, point L is at (0, 10) or (0, -10). Let's pick one; since the problem doesn't specify direction, but lengths are positive. Either way, the distance will be same.

So coordinates of L: (0, 10) or (0, -10). Let's take (0, 10) for simplicity.

Now, we need to find y, which is the length of LJ. Let's compute that. From L(0,10) to J(5,0):

Distance LJ = sqrt[(5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10)^2] = sqrt[25 + 100] = sqrt[125] = 5*sqrt(5). 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option D is 5√5. So that would suggest the answer is D. But let me verify again my steps to ensure no mistakes.

First, coordinates setup:

- K(-20, 0), M(0, 0), J(5, 0). Correct since JM is 5 units.

- L(0, d). Since LM is vertical (perpendicular to KM which is horizontal). Correct.

Then slopes of LK and LJ:

LK slope: (0 - d)/(-20 - 0) = d/20. Correct.

LJ slope: (0 - d)/(5 - 0) = -d/5. Correct.

Product: (d/20)(-d/5) = -d²/100 = -1 ⇒ d²=100 ⇒ d=±10. Correct.

Thus, distance LJ is sqrt[(5)^2 + (10)^2] = sqrt(25+100)=sqrt(125)=5√5. Which is option D. So answer should be D.

But let me check if there are alternative configurations. For example, if J was on the other side of M, but that would make JM negative. Wait, earlier assumption was that J is on the extension of KM beyond M, so that JM is 5. But if J were between K and M, then JM would be less than KM. But since KM is 20, and JM is 5, that would be possible. Wait, but then M is on line KJ, so J could be between K and M. Let me check that possibility.

Suppose J is between K and M. Then, since M is on line KJ, then K---J---M. In that case, JM would be the distance from J to M, which would be part of KM. But KM is 20. So JM is 5, implying that KJ is KM - JM = 20 - 5 = 15? Wait, but how does that affect coordinates?

Let me re-examine. If J is between K and M, then coordinates would be different. Let me try this scenario.

If J is between K and M, then coordinates of J would be somewhere between K(-20, 0) and M(0, 0). Let's say JM = 5, so from J to M is 5 units. Then, since KM is 20, then KJ would be KM - JM = 20 - 5 = 15. Therefore, coordinates of J would be located 15 units from K towards M. So starting at K(-20, 0), moving 15 units towards M(0, 0), which is 15 units along the x-axis. So J would be at (-20 + 15, 0) = (-5, 0). Thus, J(-5, 0). Then JM is the distance from J(-5, 0) to M(0, 0) is 5 units, correct.

In this case, let's recalculate the coordinates for L. Again, LM is vertical, so L is (0, d). Then, lines LK and LJ must be perpendicular.

Coordinates:

K(-20, 0), L(0, d), J(-5, 0).

Slope of LK: (0 - d)/(-20 - 0) = d/20.

Slope of LJ: (0 - d)/(-5 - 0) = (-d)/(-5) = d/5.

Their product: (d/20)*(d/5) = d²/(100). Since they are perpendicular, this product should be -1. Wait, but here it's positive d²/100. Which equals -1 only if d² is negative, which isn't possible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, this configuration is invalid. Therefore, J cannot be between K and M. Therefore, our initial assumption that J is beyond M from K is correct. Therefore, J is at (5, 0).

Hence, the previous calculation holds, leading to y = 5√5. So answer D.

Another check: What about the length of LM? Since LM is from L(0,10) to M(0,0), its length is 10 units. So x = 10. Also, length LK is from L(0,10) to K(-20, 0): sqrt[(-20 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10)^2] = sqrt[400 + 100] = sqrt(500) = 10√5. So z = 10√5. All given constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, y is indeed 5√5. So answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints and assigning coordinates to simplify the relationships. Here's the structured analysis:

---

### **Step 1: Coordinate Setup**

We place point $ M $ at the origin $(0, 0)$ to simplify computations due to the perpendicularity conditions.  
Given:
- $ \text{Length}(KM) = 20 $
- $ \text{Length}(JM) = 5 $

Assume $ K $ lies on the x-axis, so $ K = (-20, 0) $.  
Since $ M $ lies on line $ KJ $, and $ JM = 5 $, point $ J $ must lie 5 units from $ M $ along the same line $ KJ $. Extending from $ K $ through $ M $, we place $ J $ at $ (5, 0) $, so that $ JM = 5 $.

---

### **Step 2: Perpendicular Constraints**

From the problem:
- $ \text{Perpendicular}(\overline{KM}, \overline{LM}) $ implies $ \overline{LM} $ is vertical (since $ \overline{KM} $ is horizontal).
- So point $ L $ lies vertically above or below $ M $, i.e., on the y-axis. Assign $ L = (0, d) $, where $ d \neq 0 $.

---

### **Step 3: Use Perpendicular Slopes Condition**

Lines $ \overline{LK} $ and $ \overline{LJ} $ are perpendicular. Compute their slopes:

- Slope of $ \overline{LK} $:  
$$
\frac{0 - d}{-20 - 0} = \frac{-d}{-20} = \frac{d}{20}
$$
- Slope of $ \overline{LJ} $:  
$$
\frac{0 - d}{5 - 0} = \frac{-d}{5}
$$

The condition for perpendicularity is:
$$
\left( \frac{d}{20} \right)\left( \frac{-d}{5} \right) = -1
\Rightarrow \frac{-d^2}{100} = -1 \Rightarrow d^2 = 100 \Rightarrow d = \pm 10
$$

Choose $ d = 10 $ (the sign does not affect the final length).

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ y = \text{Length}(\overline{LJ}) $**

With $ L = (0, 10) $ and $ J = (5, 0) $, use the distance formula:
$$
y = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 100} = \sqrt{125} = 5\sqrt{5}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All derived values satisfy the original geometric constraints, confirming the correctness of the computation.

**Final Answer: D**  
$\boxed{\text{D}}$
