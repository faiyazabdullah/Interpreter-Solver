MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

We have points A, B, C, D. The lengths between some pairs are given as variables: BC = y, BD = x, AD = 10, AB = 12. Also, CD = z. There are perpendicularity conditions: line BC is perpendicular to BA, and line DB is perpendicular to DA. Additionally, point D lies on line AC. 

So, maybe drawing a diagram would help. Since there are perpendicular lines and points lying on lines, coordinate geometry might be useful here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me start by placing point A at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since AB is 12 units long, and we have a perpendicular condition between BC and BA. Wait, BA is from B to A, so if BA is horizontal? Let me think.

Since BC is perpendicular to BA, which means that BA and BC form a right angle at point B. So, if BA is along the x-axis, then BC would be vertical. But I need to define coordinates properly.

Let me fix coordinate system. Let me assume point A is at (0, 0). Let me take AB along the x-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s suppose point B is at (12, 0), because AB = 12. Now, since BC is perpendicular to BA. BA is from B to A, direction vector (-12, 0). Therefore, BC should be vertical upwards or downwards from B. Let me assume upwards for simplicity. So point C would be somewhere along the vertical line passing through B. Let me denote coordinates of C as (12, k), since moving vertically from B (which is at (12, 0)).

Now, another condition: Point D lies on line AC. So line AC connects points A(0,0) and C(12, k). Let me parametrize line AC. Any point on AC can be expressed as (12t, kt) where t ranges from 0 to 1. So point D is somewhere on this line. Let me write coordinates of D as (12t, kt) for some parameter t.

Additionally, there's a perpendicular condition: line DB is perpendicular to line DA. Let me check that. DA is from D to A, and DB is from D to B. So vectors DA and DB should be perpendicular. Vector DA is A - D = (0 - 12t, 0 - kt) = (-12t, -kt). Vector DB is B - D = (12 - 12t, 0 - kt) = (12(1 - t), -kt). Their dot product should be zero.

Calculating the dot product:

(-12t)(12(1 - t)) + (-kt)(-kt) = 0

Which simplifies to:

-144t(1 - t) + k²t² = 0

Factor out t:

t[ -144(1 - t) + k²t ] = 0

Solutions are t=0 or -144 + 144t + k² t = 0 → t(144 + k²) = 144 → t = 144 / (144 + k²)

But t=0 corresponds to point A, but D is a different point, so we take t = 144/(144 + k²). Let me note that.

Also, since D lies on AC, coordinates of D are (12t, kt) where t = 144/(144 + k²).

Now, also given that length of AD is 10. Let me compute AD using coordinates. Coordinates of A are (0,0), coordinates of D are (12t, kt). So distance AD squared is (12t)^2 + (kt)^2 = t²(144 + k²). This equals 10^2 = 100. Therefore,

t²(144 + k²) = 100.

But earlier, t = 144/(144 + k²). Let me substitute that into this equation.

[(144/(144 + k²))]^2 * (144 + k²) ) = 100

Simplify: 144² / (144 + k²) ) = 100

Multiply both sides by (144 + k²):

144² = 100*(144 + k²)

Compute left side: 144*144 = 20736

Right side: 100*144 + 100k² = 14400 + 100k²

Thus:

20736 = 14400 + 100k²

Subtract 14400:

20736 - 14400 = 6336 = 100k² → k² = 6336 / 100 = 63.36

Wait, 6336 divided by 100 is 63.36? Let me verify:

Yes, 100*63 = 6300, so 6336 - 6300 = 36, so 63.36. Alternatively, 6336/100 = 63.36. However, perhaps I made a miscalculation here?

Wait, let me recheck:

Original equation after substitution:

144² = 100*(144 + k²)

Calculate 144²: 144*144. Well, 100² is 10000, 144² is 20736. Correct.

Then 20736 = 100*144 + 100k² → 20736 = 14400 + 100k² → 20736 - 14400 = 6336 = 100k² → k² = 6336 / 100 = 63.36. Yes.

Hmm, but 63.36 seems messy. Maybe I can express it as a fraction. Let me see:

6336 ÷ 16 = 396, 100 ÷ 16 = 6.25. Not helpful. Alternatively, 6336 = 144*44? Wait 144*40=5760, 144*4=576, total 5760+576=6336. Yes! So 6336 = 144*44. Thus, k² = 144*44 / 100 = (144/100)*44 = (36/25)*44 = (36*44)/25. Let me compute that:

36*44: 36*40=1440, 36*4=144 → total 1440+144=1584. So k² = 1584/25. Hence, k = sqrt(1584/25) = (sqrt(1584))/5. Simplify sqrt(1584): factor 1584.

Divide by 16: 1584 ÷16=99. So sqrt(16*99)=4√99. Therefore, k = 4√99 /5. Hmm, okay. So k = (4√99)/5. Let me keep that aside for later.

Now, our goal is to find x, which is the length of BD. Let me recall that BD is the distance between points B(12, 0) and D(12t, kt). Let me compute coordinates of D again. Earlier, we had t = 144/(144 + k²). But since k² = 1584/25, let me compute denominator:

144 + k² = 144 + 1584/25. Convert 144 to 25ths: 144 = 3600/25. So 3600/25 + 1584/25 = (3600 + 1584)/25 = 5184/25. Therefore, t = 144 / (5184/25) ) = 144 * (25/5184) = simplify numerator and denominator.

Note that 144 divides into 5184 how many times? 5184 ÷ 144 = 36. Because 144*36 = 5184. Therefore, t = (144 * 25)/5184 = 25/36. So t = 25/36.

Therefore, coordinates of D are (12t, kt) = (12*(25/36), k*(25/36)). Simplify:

12*(25/36) = (12/36)*25 = (1/3)*25 = 25/3 ≈ 8.333...

Similarly, kt = k*(25/36). But k was sqrt(1584)/5. Wait, earlier I said k² = 1584/25, so k = sqrt(1584)/5. Let me compute sqrt(1584). As before, 1584 factors: divide by 16 gives 99, so sqrt(16*99)=4√99. Therefore, k = 4√99 / 5. So kt = (4√99 /5)*(25/36) = (4√99 * 25)/(5*36) = (4√99 *5)/36 = (20√99)/36 = (5√99)/9. 

So coordinates of D are (25/3, 5√99/9). Now, let me compute BD. Coordinates of B are (12, 0), coordinates of D are (25/3, 5√99/9). So difference in x-coordinates: 25/3 - 12 = 25/3 - 36/3 = -11/3. Difference in y-coordinates: 5√99/9 - 0 = 5√99/9. Therefore, BD squared is (-11/3)^2 + (5√99/9)^2.

Compute each term:

First term: (121)/9

Second term: (25*99)/81. Because (5√99/9)^2 = 25*99 / 81.

Simplify second term: 25*99 /81. Let me compute 99/81 = 11/9. So 25*(11/9) = 275/9.

So total BD squared is 121/9 + 275/9 = (121 + 275)/9 = 396/9 = 44. Therefore, BD = √44 = 2√11. Which is approximately 6.633... 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 2√11, which matches this result. So x = 2√11, so answer is B.

Wait, let me check my steps again for errors. First, when computing BD squared, did I do that correctly?

Coordinates of D: x-coordinate is 25/3, which is approx 8.333, while B is at 12. So difference is 25/3 - 12 = 25/3 - 36/3 = -11/3. Squared is 121/9. Y-coordinate difference is 5√99 /9. Squared is (25 * 99)/81. Let me compute 25*99: 25*(100 -1) = 2500 -25 = 2475. Then 2475 /81. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 9: 2475 ÷9= 275; 81 ÷9=9. So 275/9. Then adding to 121/9: 121 + 275 = 396. 396/9 = 44. Yes, correct. So BD squared is 44, hence BD is sqrt(44) = 2*sqrt(11). So answer is B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, D)) $, we proceed systematically using coordinate geometry and the given constraints.

---

### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**

Let’s place the points on a coordinate plane for clarity:

- Place point $ A $ at the origin: $ A = (0, 0) $
- Since $ AB = 12 $, place point $ B $ at $ (12, 0) $

Given that $ \overline{BC} \perp \overline{BA} $, and since $ \vec{AB} $ is along the x-axis, $ \overline{BC} $ must be vertical. So point $ C $ lies directly above $ B $, i.e., $ C = (12, k) $ for some $ k > 0 $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Perpendicularity Condition Between $ \overline{DB} $ and $ \overline{DA} $**

This tells us that the vectors $ \vec{DA} $ and $ \vec{DB} $ are perpendicular. So their dot product is zero:

$$
\vec{DA} = A - D = (x_D, y_D), \quad \vec{DB} = B - D = (12 - x_D, -y_D)
$$

Their dot product:

$$
(x_D)(12 - x_D) + (y_D)(-y_D) = 0
\Rightarrow x_D(12 - x_D) - y_D^2 = 0
\Rightarrow 12x_D - x_D^2 - y_D^2 = 0
$$

Also, since point $ D $ lies on line $ \overline{AC} $, which goes from $ A(0,0) $ to $ C(12, k) $, its coordinates can be written parametrically as:

$$
D = (12t, kt)
$$

Plug these into the previous equation:

$$
12(12t) - (12t)^2 - (kt)^2 = 0 \\
144t - 144t^2 - k^2t^2 = 0 \\
t(144 - t(144 + k^2)) = 0
$$

Ignoring the trivial solution $ t = 0 $, we get:

$$
t = \frac{144}{144 + k^2}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Use Given Length $ AD = 10 $**

Using the coordinates of $ D = (12t, kt) $, compute the square of the distance $ AD $:

$$
AD^2 = (12t)^2 + (kt)^2 = t^2(144 + k^2) = 100
$$

Substitute $ t = \frac{144}{144 + k^2} $:

$$
\left(\frac{144}{144 + k^2}\right)^2 (144 + k^2) = 100 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{144^2}{144 + k^2} = 100
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
144^2 = 100(144 + k^2)
\Rightarrow 20736 = 14400 + 100k^2
\Rightarrow 6336 = 100k^2
\Rightarrow k^2 = \frac{6336}{100} = 63.36
$$

Now calculate $ t $:

$$
t = \frac{144}{144 + 63.36} = \frac{144}{207.36}
$$

Use exact values instead of decimal approximation. Recall:

$$
k^2 = \frac{6336}{100} = \frac{1584}{25}, \quad \text{so } t = \frac{144}{144 + \frac{1584}{25}} = \frac{144}{\frac{3600 + 1584}{25}} = \frac{144 \cdot 25}{5184} = \frac{3600}{5184} = \frac{25}{36}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute Distance $ BD $**

With $ t = \frac{25}{36} $, the coordinates of $ D $ are:

$$
D_x = 12t = 12 \cdot \frac{25}{36} = \frac{25}{3}, \quad D_y = kt = \frac{k \cdot 25}{36}
$$

Recall that $ k^2 = \frac{1584}{25} \Rightarrow k = \frac{\sqrt{1584}}{5} = \frac{4\sqrt{99}}{5} $. So:

$$
D_y = \frac{4\sqrt{99}}{5} \cdot \frac{25}{36} = \frac{100\sqrt{99}}{180} = \frac{5\sqrt{99}}{9}
$$

Now compute the squared distance $ BD^2 $:

$$
BD^2 = (x_B - x_D)^2 + (y_B - y_D)^2 = (12 - \frac{25}{3})^2 + (0 - \frac{5\sqrt{99}}{9})^2
$$

Compute each part:

- $ 12 - \frac{25}{3} = \frac{36}{3} - \frac{25}{3} = \frac{11}{3} \Rightarrow (\frac{11}{3})^2 = \frac{121}{9} $
- $ (\frac{5\sqrt{99}}{9})^2 = \frac{25 \cdot 99}{81} = \frac{2475}{81} = \frac{275}{9} $

Add them together:

$$
BD^2 = \frac{121}{9} + \frac{275}{9} = \frac{396}{9} = 44
\Rightarrow BD = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, D)) = BD = 2\sqrt{11} $

---
