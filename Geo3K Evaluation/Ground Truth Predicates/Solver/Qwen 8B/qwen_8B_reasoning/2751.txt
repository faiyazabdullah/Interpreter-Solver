Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and visualize the diagram based on the constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given conditions:

1. Measure of angle at Y, Z, I (which would be ∠YIZ) is 20 degrees.
2. Measure of angle at W, X, J (∠WXJ) is 130 degrees.
3. Point H lies on lines GI and GZ. So, H is the intersection point of lines GI and GZ? Wait, but since both lines GI and GZ originate from G, then H is a point along those lines. But since H lies on both GI and GZ, that suggests that H is the same as G? No, because if H is on line GI and also on line GZ, then unless I and Z are colinear with G, which they might be. Hmm, maybe there's more to it. Also, H lies on line JX. So H is on JX as well. That seems important.

Wait, let me note down each constraint:

- Point H lies on Line(G, I): So H is somewhere on the line connecting G and I.
- Point H lies on Line(G, Z): Similarly, H is on the line connecting G and Z. Therefore, H must be the intersection point of lines GI and GZ. But if two lines GI and GZ share a common endpoint G, then their intersection is only at G. Unless points I and Z are arranged such that lines GI and GZ are overlapping? Wait, but unless I and Z are the same point, which they aren't. So perhaps there's a mistake here? Or maybe H is another point?

Wait, no. If H is on both GI and GZ, then H must lie on both lines. Since both lines pass through G, the only way for H to be on both lines is if H=G? Because otherwise, if H is different from G, then GI and GZ are two different lines passing through G, so their intersection is only at G. Hence, H must be G? But then later constraints say that I lies on Line(H,Z). If H is G, then Line(H,Z) is Line(G,Z), and I lies on that line. Which matches the condition that I is on Line(G,Z). Wait, but earlier we had that I is on Line(G,Z)? Wait, original constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(H, Z)) – so I lies on the line connecting H and Z. And PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(G, Z)). So combining these, since H is on Line(G,I) and Line(G,Z), meaning H is either G or another point. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally.

Let me try again. Let me consider the points mentioned:

Points involved: G, I, Z, H, J, X, W, Y.

First, H lies on Line(G, I) and Line(G, Z). So H is a point that's on both GI and GZ. Since both lines GI and GZ start at G, their only common point is G itself. Therefore, H must be G? Otherwise, if H were another point, then GI and GZ would have to intersect at H, but they already meet at G. So unless there's some overlap. Wait, unless H is another intersection point, but in general, two lines intersect only once. So unless GI and GZ are the same line, which would mean I and Z are colinear with G. But the problem doesn't state that. So maybe H is G? Then H= G? But then later constraints mention H lying on Line(J,X). So if H=G, then G lies on Line(J,X). Also, I lies on Line(H,Z) which would be Line(G,Z). Which is consistent with the initial condition that I is on Line(G,Z).

So maybe H is G? But then why specify H separately? Maybe there's something wrong with my assumption. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the constraints? Wait, let me check again:

Original constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, I)): So H is on GI.

PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, Z)): H is on GZ.

Therefore, H is the intersection point of GI and GZ. Since both lines pass through G, the only intersection is at G. Therefore, H=G. So H is G. So substituting H with G in other constraints.

Then, other constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(H, Z)): Since H=G, this becomes I lies on Line(G,Z). Which was already stated in PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(G,Z)).

Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(J,Y)): So I lies on Line(J,Y).

Also, PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(J,X)): Since H=G, G lies on Line(J,X). So G is on JX.

Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(W,Y)): X lies on Line(W,Y).

PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(W,Z)): X lies on Line(W,Z). So X is the intersection of Lines(W,Y) and (W,Z). Therefore, X is on both lines, implying that X=W? No, because if X is on both lines WY and WZ, then X could be W or another point. Wait, if X is on both lines WY and WZ, then X is the intersection of WY and WZ. So unless WY and WZ are the same line, which would require Y and Z being colinear with W. Not sure yet.

Also, PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(X,Z)): Y lies on Line(X,Z).

And PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(W,Z)): Y lies on Line(W,Z). So Y is on both Line(X,Z) and Line(W,Z). Therefore, Y is the intersection of Line(X,Z) and Line(W,Z). Which implies that Y is on Z? Or Y is another point on the line WZ. So Y is somewhere on line WZ. Also, since Y is on Line(X,Z), which connects X and Z, so Y is on both WZ and XZ. Therefore, Y is the intersection of lines WZ and XZ. So that would make Y lie on line WZ and XZ. Thus, forming triangle XYZ? Or maybe quadrilateral?

This is getting complex. Maybe I need to think about angles given.

Given angles:

MeasureOf(Angle(Y, Z, I)) = 20°, which is ∠YZI = 20°.

MeasureOf(Angle(W, X, J)) = 130°, which is ∠WXJ = 130°.

We need to find measure of ∠YIZ.

Additionally, given that IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. Since we thought H=G, then HJ is GJ. So IJ / XJ = GJ / YJ.

But first, let me confirm whether H=G. If H is G, then HJ is GJ. So the ratio becomes IJ / XJ = GJ / YJ.

But how can I use this ratio? Perhaps triangles similar? Or using the Law of Sines or Cosines?

Alternatively, maybe there's some proportionality due to parallel lines or similar triangles.

But before that, let me try to reconstruct the figure.

Starting with point G. From G, there are lines to I and Z. Since H is on GI and GZ, and we concluded H=G. So G is connected to I and Z. Also, G lies on Line(J,X), so J and X are connected through G. So Line(JX) passes through G.

Also, I lies on Line(J,Y). So Line(JY) passes through I.

Also, X lies on Line(W,Y) and Line(W,Z). So X is the intersection of WY and WZ. Therefore, W, X, Y, Z are arranged such that X is between W and Y, and also between W and Z? Wait, if X is on both WY and WZ, then X is the intersection point of those two lines. Therefore, W is connected to Y and Z, and X is where those two lines meet. So W is connected to X, which connects to Y and Z.

Also, Y lies on Line(X,Z) and Line(W,Z). So Y is on line WZ and on line XZ. Therefore, Y is the intersection of lines WZ and XZ. So that would imply that Y is on line WZ and line XZ. Therefore, Y is a point on line XZ and on line WZ, making it the intersection of those two lines. So lines XZ and WZ meet at Y. Hence, Y is on line WZ and line XZ, so Y is between X and Z? Or depending on positions.

Now, considering angles:

∠WXJ = 130°, which is at point X, between W, X, J. So vertex at X, with segments XW and XJ. Given that X is on Line(W,Y) and Line(W,Z). Wait, but J is another point. Earlier, we saw that G is on Line(J,X), so J is connected to X via G. So Line(JX) goes through G.

So J is a point such that Line(JX) passes through G. So J, X, G are colinear. So J-G-X are on a straight line. Therefore, ∠WXJ is formed by points W, X, J. Since J is on Line(JX), which includes X and G. So angle at X between W and J.

Similarly, ∠YZI is 20°, which is at point Z, between Y, Z, I. So vertex at Z, with segments ZY and ZI.

Our goal is to find ∠YIZ, which is the angle at I between Y, I, Z. Wait, no: ∠YIZ is at point I, between Y, I, Z. Wait, the notation ∠(Y, Z, I) means angle at Z, between Y, Z, I. Wait, the standard notation is ∠ABC is the angle at B. So ∠(Y, Z, I) is angle at Z between Y and I. So that is ∠YZI = 20°, as given.

But the question asks for m∠YIZ, which is the angle at I between Y and Z. So ∠YIZ is the angle at I between Y and Z.

So we need to find ∠YIZ.

To approach this, perhaps we can look for triangles involving these points and apply the Law of Sines or use properties of transversals, similar triangles, etc.

Also, we have the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Since H=G, this becomes IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. So cross-multiplying gives IJ * YJ = XJ * GJ. This might suggest that triangles are similar or there's some proportionality.

Let me consider possible triangles. For example, if there are triangles involving points I, J, X, G, Y, etc.

Since J is on Line(JX), which passes through G. So points J, X, G are colinear. So J---X---G or J---G---X or X---J---G? Depending on the direction.

Also, I is on Line(J,Y). So Line(JY) passes through I.

So maybe triangles involving I, J, Y and others.

Alternatively, since we have ratios of lengths, maybe we can set up variables for certain lengths and use proportions.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates or use coordinate geometry? Although that might get complicated, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, think in terms of vectors or trigonometry.

But given the angles, maybe focusing on triangle relationships.

Let me consider triangle WXJ. We know angle at X is 130°, so ∠WXJ = 130°. Also, since X lies on lines WY and WZ, so W is connected to X, which connects to Y and Z.

Moreover, since Y is on line WZ, as per the constraints. So line WZ contains Y and X. Wait, earlier, X is on line WZ (from PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(W,Z))). So X is on line WZ. Therefore, line WZ has points W, X, Z, and Y (since Y is on line WZ). So order could be W----X----Y----Z or similar, but depends on exact placement.

Also, since Y is on line XZ (from PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(X,Z))), so Y is also on line XZ. Therefore, Y is the intersection of lines XZ and WZ. So Y is the intersection of lines XZ and WZ. Hence, line WZ intersects line XZ at Y.

Therefore, points W, X, Z are connected such that X is between W and Z, and Y is another point on line WZ beyond X or between X and Z?

Not sure yet. Let me try to imagine.

Assume that line WZ extends beyond Z to some point, but Y is on line WZ. Also, Y is on line XZ. Therefore, lines XZ and WZ intersect at Y. Therefore, Y is the intersection point of lines XZ and WZ. So if I imagine line XZ and line WZ meeting at Y.

So, in this configuration, we have several lines:

- Line WZ with points W, X, Y, Z (in some order)

- Line XZ with points X, Y, Z (since Y is on XZ)

- Line JX passing through G.

- Line GI and GZ, with H=G.

Also, I is on Line(JY) and on Line(GZ). Since I is on Line(GZ), which is part of line GZ. Also, I is on Line(JY), which connects J and Y.

So, putting this together:

Point I is on both Line(GZ) and Line(JY). Therefore, I is the intersection of lines GZ and JY.

So, lines GZ and JY intersect at I.

Therefore, I is the intersection point of GZ and JY.

Now, let's think about the angles given.

We have ∠YZI = 20°, which is at point Z between Y and I. So angle between ZY and ZI is 20°.

Also, ∠WXJ = 130°, which is at point X between W and J.

We need to find ∠YIZ, which is at point I between Y and Z.

Perhaps using triangle properties or cyclic quadrilaterals, or applying the Law of Sines in various triangles.

Another thing: The ratio IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. Since H=G, this becomes IJ / XJ = GJ / YJ. So cross multiplying gives IJ * YJ = XJ * GJ. This suggests that triangles may be similar or that there's a proportionality.

Let me see if there are similar triangles here. Suppose we consider triangles involving these points.

For instance, looking at triangle JXI and some other triangle? Or triangle JYG and something else?

Alternatively, since I is on Line(JY), and G is on Line(JX), maybe there's a relationship between these lines.

Alternatively, since I is on Line(GZ), and G is on Line(JX), then maybe there's a way to relate segments.

Alternatively, maybe considering mass point geometry? Or coordinate geometry?

Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to points to model the situation.

Let me place point X at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.

Since X is on line WZ and line WY, let me define coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume coordinates:

Let’s set X at (0, 0).

Let me suppose line WZ is the x-axis. So points W, X, Z, Y are on the x-axis. Wait, but then line WZ is horizontal.

But earlier, we have angle ∠WXJ = 130°, which involves point J. So J is not on the x-axis unless specified. However, since G lies on line JX (as H=G), and X is at (0,0), then line JX passes through G. Let me try to define coordinates step by step.

Let me proceed:

Set X at (0,0).

Let me take line WZ as the x-axis. So points W, X, Z, Y lie on the x-axis. Assume that X is between W and Z. So let me define:

- Let W be at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.

- X is at (0, 0).

- Z is at (b, 0) for some b > 0.

- Y is a point on line WZ (x-axis), so its coordinates are (c, 0), where c is between -a and b or outside.

But also, Y is on line XZ. Since X is (0,0) and Z is (b, 0), line XZ is the same as line WZ (the x-axis). Therefore, Y is on line XZ, which is the x-axis. Therefore, Y is on the x-axis, so coordinates (c, 0). So Y is somewhere on the x-axis between X and Z or extended.

But earlier, we have that ∠YZI = 20°, which is at point Z between Y and I. So point I is not on the x-axis. Let me think about where I is located.

Point I is on Line(GZ) and Line(JY). So Line(GZ) is the line from G to Z. Since Z is at (b, 0), and G is somewhere else. Also, Line(JY) is the line from J to Y. So J is a point such that line JX passes through G. Since X is at (0,0), line JX passes through G. Let me denote coordinates for J and G.

Since line JX passes through G, and X is at (0,0), let me parametrize line JX. Let me assume that G is a point on line JX. Let me define coordinates for J and G.

Suppose line JX has some slope. Let me assume that J is at (d, e) and X is at (0,0), so line JX passes through G. Let me pick specific values for simplicity. Let me assume that G is at (k, 0), but wait, since X is on the x-axis, and line JX passes through G. If G is on the x-axis, then line JX would be the x-axis if J is also on x-axis. But then J would be on x-axis, so line JX is the x-axis. But then I is on Line(JY) and Line(GZ). If J is on x-axis, then Line(JY) is the line from J to Y, which is on x-axis. So Line(JY) is a segment on x-axis. But I is also on Line(GZ). Assuming G is on x-axis, then Line(GZ) is the line from G to Z, which is on x-axis. So Line(GZ) is also on x-axis. Therefore, I would be on x-axis, but then ∠YZI would be 0° or undefined, which conflicts with given value of 20°. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, G cannot be on x-axis. Therefore, line JX is not the x-axis. Therefore, J is not on x-axis, and G is not on x-axis.

Thus, my previous assumption that line WZ is x-axis and line JX passes through G requires that J is not on x-axis, hence line JX is not horizontal. So need to adjust.

Let me instead assign coordinates more carefully.

Let me fix X at (0,0). Let me take line WZ as arbitrary, not necessarily x-axis. Let me instead define coordinate system with X at (0,0), and let me define line JX as some line passing through X and G. Let me assume that J is at some point (p, q) and G is somewhere on line JX. Let me parameterize line JX. Suppose line JX has direction vector, and G is a point on it.

But this might get too abstract. Maybe better to use vector methods or consider angles.

Alternatively, focus on the angles given.

We have ∠WXJ = 130°, which is at point X between W and J. Since X is connected to W and to J. Given that X is on line WZ, and line JX passes through G.

Also, ∠YZI = 20°, which is at point Z between Y and I.

Need to find ∠YIZ.

Let me consider triangle YIZ. In this triangle, we need to find angle at I. To do that, perhaps knowing other angles or sides.

But without concrete measurements, it's challenging. Let me think about the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ.

This ratio suggests that maybe there's a similarity between triangles involving these segments. For example, if triangles IJY and GXJ are similar? Or some other pair.

Alternatively, since IJ / XJ = GJ / YJ, rearranged as IJ / GJ = XJ / YJ, which resembles the property of similar triangles where corresponding sides are proportional.

If we can find two triangles that have these sides proportional and included angles equal, then we could establish similarity.

Alternatively, consider triangle IJY and triangle GXJ? Let me check:

In triangle IJY and GXJ:

- IJ corresponds to GX?

- XJ corresponds to YJ?

Wait, if IJ/GJ = XJ/YJ, then if we have triangles where IJ and GX are corresponding sides, and XJ and YJ are corresponding sides, then maybe similarity.

But need to verify angles.

Alternatively, since I is on Line(JY) and G is on Line(JX), maybe there's a transversal or something.

Alternatively, think about mass point or Menelaus' theorem.

Alternatively, since we have multiple lines intersecting, perhaps using Ceva's theorem.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Let me try to consider the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. Let me write this as IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ. This suggests that the ratio of IJ to YJ equals the ratio of XJ to GJ. This is reminiscent of the Angle Bisector Theorem, where if a line divides the opposite side in the ratio of adjacent sides, but not sure if applicable here.

Alternatively, if there's a line that creates such a ratio, like a bisector or something.

Alternatively, think of it as a proportion that could arise from similar triangles.

Let me consider triangles involving J. For example, suppose there is a triangle with base YJ and some other triangle with base XJ, scaled by the ratio.

Alternatively, since I is on Line(JY), and G is on Line(JX), perhaps there's a way to express the ratio IJ/YJ and XJ/GJ.

Let me denote some variables.

Let me call length IJ = a, XJ = b, GJ = c, YJ = d. Given that a/b = c/d → ad = bc.

But how does this help?

Maybe if I can express these lengths in terms of other parts of the diagram.

Alternatively, consider triangles that include these segments.

For instance, triangle JIG and triangle JXG? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the position of I relative to JY and G relative to JX.

Since I is on Line(JY), and G is on Line(JX). So, if I consider line JY and line JX, which meet at J. So, J is the intersection of lines JY and JX.

So, if I consider point J, with lines JX and JY emanating from it. Points G on JX and I on JY.

So, the ratio IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ.

Which is equivalent to saying that (IJ)/(YJ) = (XJ)/(GJ). This looks like the condition for the lines being divided proportionally, which often relates to similar triangles or the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem).

Indeed, if we have two lines intersecting at J, with points I on one line and G on the other, such that IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ, then perhaps there's a parallelogram or something, or maybe similar triangles.

Alternatively, if there's a transversal cutting across two lines, creating proportional segments.

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to say.

However, if we consider the possibility of similar triangles, let's assume that triangles JIG and JXY are similar? Or some other combination.

Alternatively, if we consider triangles JIX and JG... something.

Alternatively, since we have angle measures, maybe using the Law of Sines in certain triangles.

Let me think about triangle WXJ, where ∠WXJ = 130°. Let's consider that triangle. Let me denote:

In triangle WXJ, we know angle at X is 130°. Let me denote sides:

- WX: length from W to X

- XJ: length from X to J

- WJ: length from W to J

Using the Law of Sines:

sin(∠WXJ)/WJ = sin(∠WJX)/WX = sin(∠JWX)/XJ

But without knowing other angles or sides, this might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, consider triangle JXG. Since G is on line JX, and I is on line JY. But I don't know much about G.

Wait, but earlier we had that H=G is on line GI and GZ. So G is connected to Z. So line GZ connects G to Z. And I is on line GZ. So I is a point on line GZ.

So, in addition to being on line JY, I is on line GZ.

So, I is the intersection of lines JY and GZ.

So, point I is where JY meets GZ.

So, if I consider triangle JYG and triangle ... ?

Wait, if I is on JY and on GZ, then perhaps there's a relation between triangles involving these lines.

But still, not sure.

Let me try to think about the angles again. We need to find ∠YIZ, which is at point I between Y and Z. So, angle between lines IY and IZ.

Given that I is on line GZ, so line IGZ passes through I. Therefore, line IZ is part of line GZ.

Also, I is on line JY, so line IJY passes through I.

So, at point I, we have two lines: one going to Z (along GZ), and one going to Y (along JY).

So, ∠YIZ is the angle between line IY and line IZ.

To find this angle, perhaps we can find the other angles in triangle YIZ and subtract from 180°.

But for that, we'd need to know other angles or sides.

Alternatively, consider triangle YIZ, where we know ∠YZI = 20°, and want ∠YIZ.

If we can find ∠IZY or other angles, or use Law of Sines.

But to use Law of Sines, we need relations between sides.

Alternatively, consider the fact that I is the intersection of JY and GZ. So, perhaps applying Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Menelaus' theorem applies to a transversal cutting through a triangle, while Ceva's theorem deals with concurrent lines.

Alternatively, consider triangle JYZ with point I on JY and G on JX (but not sure).

Alternatively, since we have the ratio IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ, which might hint towards Ceva's theorem.

Let me recall Ceva's theorem: In a triangle ABC, if lines AD, BE, CF are concurrent, then (AF/FB)(BD/DC)(CE/EA) = 1.

But how to apply this here?

Alternatively, if we can form a triangle where these ratios fit.

Let me try to consider triangle JYZ. Suppose we have lines from J, Y, Z.

But I is on JY, G is on JX (not sure about relation to triangle JYZ). Not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle JXZ. Let me try:

In triangle JXZ, point I is on JY and G is on JX. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle JXG. Not helpful.

Alternatively, think of triangle JYZ. Let me think.

Wait, maybe not. Let me go back to the ratio IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ. Let me rewrite this as IJ/GJ = XJ/YJ. This suggests that the ratio of IJ to GJ equals the ratio of XJ to YJ. This is similar to the condition for the angle bisector theorem, but not quite. It suggests that if there is a line that divides the opposite side proportionally, but not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider line JI and line JG, with points dividing segments in certain ratios.

But since I is on JY and G is on JX, maybe there's a way to connect them.

Alternatively, consider that the ratio IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ suggests that there's a spiral similarity or something.

Alternatively, since I am stuck here, maybe I should try to find the measure of ∠YIZ using the given angles and relationships.

Let me consider the angles around point Z. At point Z, we have ∠YZI = 20°, and possibly other angles.

Since I is on line GZ, then line ZI is part of line ZG. So, if I can find the angle between ZI and some other line, maybe related to ∠YZI.

Also, considering the given ∠WXJ = 130°, which is at point X. Maybe there's a way to relate this angle to other parts of the diagram.

Let me try to consider the entire diagram.

At point X, we have angle ∠WXJ = 130°. Since X is on line WZ, and J is on line JX, which passes through G. Let me imagine extending lines to see if any alternate interior angles or something.

Also, since I is on line GZ, and G is on line JX, so line GZ connects G to Z, and line JX connects J to X, with G on JX.

Let me think about the lines involved.

At point X, we have line XJ (part of JX) and line XW (part of WZ). The angle between them is 130°, so ∠WXJ = 130°.

At point Z, we have line ZY (part of WZ) and line ZI (part of GZ), with ∠YZI = 20°.

If I can relate these angles through some transversal or other relations.

Let me consider the lines GZ and JX intersecting at G, and lines JY and GZ intersecting at I.

Maybe there's a way to find some vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Alternatively, since we have multiple lines intersecting, perhaps using the concept of exterior angles.

Alternatively, consider the sum of angles around certain points.

Let me think about the total angles around point X.

At point X, we have angle ∠WXJ = 130°, and since X is on line WZ, the line XZ is part of line WZ. So, if I consider line XZ, which is the same as line WZ, then at point X, the line XZ is extending to Z.

Also, line XJ is another line from X to J.

So, at point X, the lines XW, XZ, and XJ are present. Wait, but XW is part of line WZ, and XJ is another line.

The angle between XW and XJ is 130°, as given.

Now, if I can find the angle between XJ and XZ, which would be supplementary to ∠WXJ if XW and XZ are in a straight line. Wait, since W, X, Z are colinear (because X is on line WZ), then XW and XZ are in a straight line, forming a straight angle of 180°. So the angle between XW and XZ is 180°, and ∠WXJ is the angle between XW and XJ, which is 130°, so the angle between XJ and XZ would be 180° - 130° = 50°.

Ah! So at point X, the angle between XJ and XZ is 50°. Let me verify:

Yes, since XW and XZ are in a straight line (as X is on line WZ), so the angle between XW and XZ is 180°. The angle between XW and XJ is given as 130°, so the remaining angle between XJ and XZ is 180° - 130° = 50°. So ∠JXZ = 50°.

Now, this angle ∠JXZ is at point X between J and Z.

Now, let's consider triangle JXZ. In this triangle, we know ∠JXZ = 50°, and we might be able to find other angles or sides.

But how does this help us with ∠YIZ?

Well, let me think about line JX passing through G, and line GZ passing through I. So, point G is on line JX, and I is on line GZ.

So, line GZ connects G to Z, and I is a point on it. So, line GZ passes through I and Z.

So, if I consider triangle JXZ, and point G on JX, and point I on GZ.

Is there a relationship between these points?

Alternatively, since we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, perhaps relating to triangle JXZ.

Wait, let me consider triangle JXZ. In this triangle, we have point G on JX, and point I on GZ. Let me try to apply the Law of Sines or something.

But I need more information.

Alternatively, since we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, let me denote this as follows:

Let me let IJ = a, XJ = b, GJ = c, YJ = d. So a/b = c/d → ad = bc.

Now, if I can relate these lengths to other parts of the diagram.

But I need to find a connection between these lengths and the angles we know.

Let me think about triangle JYZ. Point I is on JY, and we have some relations.

Wait, but I is on GZ, which is connected to Z. Maybe considering triangle JYZ and the point I on JY and GZ.

Alternatively, since I is on GZ, and G is on JX, maybe there's a way to express GI in terms of other segments.

Alternatively, consider triangles involving angle ∠YZI = 20°, which is at Z between Y and I.

At point Z, we have line ZY (part of WZ) and line ZI (part of GZ). The angle between them is 20°, so ∠YZI = 20°.

If I can find the angle between ZI and some other line, maybe related to ∠JXZ = 50°.

Let me consider line ZI, which is part of GZ. If I can find the angle between ZI and ZY, which is 20°, and relate it to other angles.

Alternatively, since G is on JX, and I is on GZ, maybe there's a way to relate angles at G or elsewhere.

Alternatively, consider triangle GIZ. In this triangle, we have point G on JX, I on GZ, and Z. But I don't know enough about the other angles.

Wait, but we know ∠JXZ = 50°, which is at X between J and Z. If I can relate this angle to other parts.

Alternatively, consider that line GZ passes through I, and line JX passes through G. So, at point G, lines JX and GZ meet. So, angle at G between JX and GZ.

But I don't know that angle.

Alternatively, think about the whole diagram and use the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ to find some relationship.

Let me try to use the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. Let me write this as IJ/GJ = XJ/YJ. This suggests that the ratio of IJ to GJ is equal to the ratio of XJ to YJ.

This is similar to the condition in the Angle Bisector Theorem, but not exactly. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But here, it's a different scenario. However, if we can find a triangle where this ratio holds, maybe with respect to some angle.

Alternatively, consider triangle JYZ, with point I on JY, and some relation to G.

Wait, if I consider triangle JYZ, and point I on JY, and point G on JX, but not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle JXZ, with point G on JX and point I on GZ.

Let me consider triangle JXZ, with point G on JX and point I on GZ. Let me apply the Law of Sines in some way.

In triangle JXZ, we know ∠JXZ = 50°, as established earlier.

Let me denote:

- In triangle JXZ, ∠JXZ = 50°.

- Let me denote ∠XJZ as some angle, say α.

- And ∠XZJ as β.

So, α + β + 50° = 180° → α + β = 130°.

But I don't know α or β.

However, if I can relate α and β to other parts of the diagram.

Note that point Y is on line WZ, and also on line XZ. So, Y is on line XZ, which is the same as line WZ. So, in triangle JXZ, point Y is on line XZ. So, Y is a point on XZ, which is side XZ of triangle JXZ.

So, Y is a point on side XZ of triangle JXZ. Therefore, we can consider line JY, which connects J to Y, and I is on line JY.

So, in triangle JXZ, line JY intersects GZ at I.

So, perhaps applying Menelaus' theorem to triangle JXZ with transversal line JYI?

Wait, Menelaus' theorem states that for a triangle ABC and a line cutting through AB at F, BC at D, and CA at E, then (AF/FB)(BD/DC)(CE/EA) = 1.

But in our case, the line is JY, which passes through J, Y, and I. But I is on GZ, which is not a side of triangle JXZ. So not sure.

Alternatively, consider Ceva's theorem, which involves concurrency of cevians.

Ceva's theorem says that for concurrent cevians, the product of certain ratios equals 1.

But if I can find three cevians concurrent at a point, but I don't know if they are.

Alternatively, since I is on GZ and on JY, and if there is a third cevian...

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, focus on the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, and try to relate it to the triangle.

Let me consider triangle JXZ, with point Y on XZ. Let me apply the Law of Sines in triangle JXZ and in triangle JYZ.

Wait, in triangle JXZ, using the Law of Sines:

XZ / sin(∠XJZ) = XJ / sin(∠XZJ) = JZ / sin(∠JXZ).

Similarly, in triangle JYZ, if I can relate it.

But I don't know much about triangle JYZ.

Alternatively, since Y is on XZ, let me denote XY = m, YZ = n, so that XZ = m + n.

But without knowing lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, let me use the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. Let me denote this as IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ = k.

So, IJ = k*XJ, and GJ = k*YJ.

Now, since G is on line JX, let me express GJ in terms of JX. Let me assume that JX is divided by G into segments JG and GX. So, JX = JG + GX.

But GJ = k*YJ, and IJ = k*XJ.

But IJ is the segment from I to J, and XJ is from X to J.

Wait, if I is on line JY, then IJ is a segment from I to J, and YJ is from Y to J. So, if I is between J and Y, then IJ + YI = YJ. Or if I is outside, it depends.

But since I is the intersection of JY and GZ, and G is on JX, it depends on the positions.

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to assume some positions.

Let me suppose that in triangle JXZ, point Y is on XZ. Let me assume that Y divides XZ in some ratio, say XY/YZ = p/q.

But I don't know p and q.

Alternatively, since we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, let me express GJ in terms of YJ, and IJ in terms of XJ.

Let me assume that G is between J and X, so that JG + GX = JX. Let me denote JG = k*YJ, and IJ = k*XJ.

But I don't know if G is between J and X or not. It could be on the extension of JX.

But since H=G is on line GI and GZ, and I is on GZ, it's possible that G is between J and X, or not.

Let me assume that G is between J and X, so that JG < JX.

Then, GJ = k*YJ, and XJ = JX - JG = JX - k*YJ.

But IJ = k*XJ = k*(JX - k*YJ).

But I is on line JY, so IJ + YI = YJ, assuming I is between J and Y. So, IJ = YJ - YI.

Substituting, YJ - YI = k*(JX - k*YJ).

This is getting too convoluted without additional info.

Perhaps I need to consider the angles again. Earlier, I found that at point X, ∠JXZ = 50°. Let me consider triangle JXZ, where ∠JXZ = 50°, and if I can find other angles.

If I can relate ∠JXZ to ∠YZI = 20°, which is at Z.

At point Z, we have ∠YZI = 20°, which is between Y and I. Since I is on line GZ, this angle is between ZY and ZI.

If I can find the angle between ZI and some other line, like ZG, which is the same as ZI since I is on GZ.

Wait, ZI is part of line GZ. So, at point Z, line ZI is part of GZ. So, the angle between ZY (which is part of WZ) and ZI (part of GZ) is 20°. 

If I can find the angle between GZ and WZ at point Z, which would be ∠GZW. But I don't know that.

But if I can relate it to other angles.

Let me think about line GZ. Since G is on line JX, and I is on line GZ, and we have some angles at X.

Earlier, at point X, ∠JXZ = 50°, which is the angle between JX and XZ. Since XZ is part of WZ, this angle is between JX and WZ.

If I can relate this angle to the angle at Z between WZ and GZ.

Let me consider that at point Z, the lines WZ and GZ meet. So, the angle between WZ and GZ at Z is ∠GZW.

If I can find this angle, then since ∠YZI = 20° is the angle between ZY (part of WZ) and ZI (part of GZ), then ∠GZW = ∠YZI + something?

Wait, if I consider the angle between WZ and GZ at Z, it would be ∠GZW. Since Y is on WZ, the angle between ZY (which is part of WZ) and ZI (part of GZ) is ∠YZI = 20°, so this implies that ∠GZW = 20°, because ZY is along WZ, and ZI is along GZ. Wait, no, because ∠YZI is the angle between ZY and ZI, which is the same as the angle between WZ and GZ at Z, since ZY is part of WZ. Therefore, ∠GZW = ∠YZI = 20°.

So, at point Z, the angle between WZ and GZ is 20°.

Now, in triangle GZX, we have angle at Z of 20°, and at X, we have angle ∠JXZ = 50°, as previously determined.

Wait, but triangle GZX? Let me clarify.

At point Z, we have line ZW and line ZG. The angle between them is 20°. At point X, we have line XZ and line XJ, with angle 50°. 

If I consider triangle XZG, it has vertices at X, Z, G. In this triangle, we know:

- At X: angle between XZ and XG is 50° (since ∠JXZ = 50°, and XG is part of XJ, assuming G is on XJ. Wait, G is on line JX, so XG is part of XJ.

Wait, if G is on line JX, then line XG is part of line XJ. So, at point X, the angle between XZ and XG is 50°, as ∠JXZ = 50°. So in triangle XZG, we have angle at X of 50°, angle at Z of 20°, and therefore the third angle at G is 180° - 50° - 20° = 110°.

So, ∠XGZ = 110°.

Now, this angle at G is part of the diagram. Now, what is this angle? It's the angle at G between XG and ZG.

But G is on line JX, so XG is part of line JX, and ZG is part of line GZ. So, ∠XGZ = 110° is the angle between line JX and line GZ at point G.

Now, let me think about line GZ, which contains point I. So, at point G, the line GZ makes an angle of 110° with line JX.

Now, since I is on line GZ, and we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, perhaps we can use this to find some relation.

Let me consider triangle JGI and triangle something else.

Wait, at point G, we have line GZ and line GX (part of JX). The angle between them is 110°. Also, I is on line GZ. Let me consider triangle JGI, where I is on GZ.

But I need more information about the sides or angles in this triangle.

Alternatively, since we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, and we know some angles, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangles involving these segments.

Let me consider triangle JIG and triangle XGZ.

Wait, not sure. Let me try.

In triangle JIG, we have sides IJ, JG, and IG.

In triangle XGZ, we have sides XG, GZ, XZ.

But without knowing lengths, it's hard to relate.

But we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ.

Let me express XJ as XJ = XG + GJ, since G is on line JX. So, XJ = XG + GJ.

But IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ → IJ/(XG + GJ) = GJ/YJ → IJ = GJ*(XG + GJ)/YJ.

But I don't know YJ or XG.

Alternatively, if I assume some lengths to simplify.

Let me assign some values to make calculations easier.

Let me assume YJ = 1. Then, from the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, and since YJ = 1, this becomes IJ/XJ = GJ/1 → IJ = XJ * GJ.

But I don't know XJ or GJ.

Alternatively, let me assume GJ = 1, then IJ = XJ * 1 = XJ. So IJ = XJ.

But I don't know if this helps.

Alternatively, let me consider triangle JXG, where G is on JX, and I is on GZ.

But I'm not making progress here.

Let me return to the angle at G, which is 110°. This angle is between line JX and GZ.

Now, since I is on line GZ, and we need to find ∠YIZ, which is at I between Y and Z.

Let me think about triangle YIZ. In this triangle, we have:

- At Z: ∠YZI = 20°

- At I: ∠YIZ = ? (what we need to find)

- At Y: ∠ZYI = ?

The sum of angles in triangle YIZ is 180°, so ∠YIZ = 180° - ∠YZI - ∠ZYI = 180° - 20° - ∠ZYI = 160° - ∠ZYI.

So, if I can find ∠ZYI, then I can find ∠YIZ.

Now, ∠ZYI is the angle at Y between Z and I.

Point Y is on line WZ and on line XZ. So, at point Y, we have lines YZ and YX (part of WZ and XZ). Also, line YI, since I is on line JY.

So, ∠ZYI is the angle at Y between Z and I, which is between lines YZ and YI.

Let me try to find this angle.

At point Y, we have line YZ (part of WZ) and line YI (part of JY). So, ∠ZYI is the angle between YZ and YI.

If I can find this angle, then I can find ∠YIZ.

How to find ∠ZYI?

Let me consider triangle YIZ, but need more info.

Alternatively, consider triangle YJI, where I is on JY.

Let me think about the lines at point Y: YZ (part of WZ), YX (part of XZ), and YI (part of JY).

So, at point Y, we have three lines: YZ, YX, and YI.

The angle between YZ and YX is ∠XYZ, which is part of the diagram. But I don't know this angle.

Alternatively, since Y is on line XZ, and X is on line WZ, then line XZ is the same as line WZ. So, Y is on line WZ, and X is also on line WZ.

So, at point Y, line YZ is part of line WZ, and line YX is also part of line WZ. Wait, no: Y is on line XZ, which is the same as line WZ. So, line XZ is the same as line WZ. Therefore, at point Y, line YZ is part of line WZ, and line YX is also part of line WZ. Wait, that would mean that Y is on line WZ, and X is also on line WZ, so line YX is part of line WZ. Hence, at point Y, lines YZ and YX are both on line WZ, so the angle between them is zero? No, that can't be. There must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, Y is on line XZ, which is the same as line WZ. So, line XZ is line WZ. Therefore, Y is a point on line WZ. X is also on line WZ. So, line YX is part of line WZ. Hence, at point Y, the lines YZ and YX are both on line WZ, so the angle between them is zero. This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect, or there's a mistake in understanding the diagram.

Wait, this indicates that Y is on line WZ and on line XZ, which is the same as line WZ. So, Y is on line WZ, and X is also on line WZ. So, Y and X are both on line WZ. Hence, line YX is part of line WZ. Therefore, at point Y, lines YZ and YX are both on line WZ, so the angle between them is zero. But this contradicts the earlier idea that ∠ZYI exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Earlier, I said that Y is on line XZ and on line WZ, so Y is the intersection of lines XZ and WZ. But if XZ is the same as WZ, then their intersection is the entire line, so Y is just a point on WZ. Hence, line YX is part of WZ, and line YZ is also part of WZ, so the angle between them is zero. This suggests that ∠ZYI is the angle between YZ (part of WZ) and YI (line from Y to I).

So, at point Y, we have line YZ (part of WZ) and line YI (connecting Y to I). So, ∠ZYI is the angle between WZ and YI at point Y.

To find this angle, perhaps consider triangle YIZ or other triangles.

Let me consider line YI. Since I is on line JY, line YI is part of line JY.

So, at point Y, line YI is part of line JY, and line YZ is part of line WZ. So, the angle between JY and WZ at point Y is ∠ZYI.

If I can find this angle, I can determine ∠ZYI.

To find this angle, let me consider the lines JY and WZ intersecting at Y. So, the angle between JY and WZ at Y is ∠ZYI.

To find this angle, perhaps using the given information about other angles.

Let me recall that at point X, we have ∠JXZ = 50°, and at point Z, ∠GZW = 20°, and at point G, ∠XGZ = 110°.

Let me try to find the angle between JY and WZ at Y.

Let me consider line JY and line WZ. These lines intersect at Y. To find the angle between them, I need to relate it to other parts of the diagram.

Let me consider triangle JYX. Wait, but X is on line WZ, and J is connected to X.

At point X, we have ∠JXZ = 50°, which is the angle between JX and XZ (part of WZ). So, this angle is between JX and WZ at X.

Now, at point Y, the angle between JY and WZ is what we need. Let me see if there's a way to relate this angle to known angles.

If I can find the angle between JY and WZ at Y, it might be related to other angles in the diagram.

Let me consider the lines JY and WZ. They intersect at Y. Let me think about the other intersections or angles.

Let me consider the line JX, which passes through G and X. At point X, we have angle ∠JXZ = 50°, which is between JX and WZ.

If I can find the angle between JY and JX, then I can use some relationship.

Since I is on JY, and G is on JX, and we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, maybe there's a way to find the angle between JY and JX.

Let me consider triangle JYX. In this triangle, we have points J, Y, X. We know ∠JXZ = 50°, but not sure about other angles.

Wait, at point X, ∠JXZ = 50°, which is part of line WZ. So, in triangle JXY, the angle at X is 50°, and we might be able to find other angles.

But to find the angle at Y in triangle JXY, we need more information.

Alternatively, since I is on JY, and we have the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle JXY and other triangles.

Let me try.

In triangle JXY, let me denote:

- ∠ at X: 50° (as ∠JXZ = 50°)

- Let me denote ∠ at Y as θ, which is ∠JYX.

- And ∠ at J as φ, so θ + φ + 50° = 180° → θ + φ = 130°.

If I can find θ or φ, I can find the angle between JY and WZ at Y, which is θ or related to it.

But how?

Let me consider line JY and line JX, which meet at J. The angle between them is φ, which is ∠XJY.

But I don't know φ.

However, if I can relate φ to other parts of the diagram.

Let me recall that G is on line JX, and I is on line JY. Also, the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ.

Let me apply the Law of Sines in triangles involving these points.

In triangle JIG and JXG?

Wait, let me consider triangle JIG. It has points J, I, G. But I don't know much about it.

Alternatively, consider triangle JGI and triangle XGZ, but not sure.

Let me try to use the given ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. Let me write this as IJ/YJ = XJ/GJ.

From this, if I can express IJ/YJ as a ratio, and relate it to angles in triangle JXY.

Let me assume that in triangle JXY, the ratio of sides IJ/YJ is related to the ratio of sines of opposite angles.

But IJ is a segment from I to J, and YJ is from Y to J. If I consider triangle JXY, then IJ is not a side of this triangle, unless I is on JY.

Wait, I is on JY, so in triangle JXY, point I is on JY. So, if I divide JY into segments JI and IY.

Let me denote JI = a, IY = b, so that JY = a + b.

From the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, we have a/XJ = GJ/(a + b).

But I don't know GJ or XJ.

But if I can find another relation involving these variables.

Let me consider triangle JXG, where G is on JX. Let me denote JG = c, GX = d, so that JX = c + d.

From the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, we have a/(c + d) = c/(a + b).

So, a(c + d) = c(a + b) → ac + ad = ac + bc → ad = bc → a/d = b/c.

This suggests that the ratio of a/d = b/c, which means that the division of JY and JX are in the same ratio.

This is similar to the condition for the Angle Bisector Theorem, but not exactly.

If this ratio holds, it might indicate that line GI is parallel to some other line, or that certain angles are equal.

But how to use this?

If a/d = b/c, then this implies that the lines JI and GX are divided proportionally, which might suggest that line GI is parallel to line YX, or something like that.

But I'm not sure. Let me consider the implications of a/d = b/c.

This suggests that the division of JY and JX are in the same ratio, which might imply that line GI is parallel to line YX, by the converse of the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem).

If GI is parallel to YX, then the corresponding angles would be equal.

Let me explore this possibility.

If GI || YX, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, the angle between GI and JX would be equal to the angle between YX and JX.

But I don't know if this is true, but let's assume it for a moment.

If GI || YX, then the angle between GI and JX is equal to the angle between YX and JX.

But the angle between YX and JX is ∠JXY, which is 50°, as we determined earlier (at point X, ∠JXZ = 50°, which is the angle between JX and XZ, which is the same as YX since Y is on XZ).

Wait, if Y is on XZ, then YX is part of XZ, which is the same as WZ. So, the angle between YX and JX is ∠JXY = 50°, as it's the same as ∠JXZ.

If GI is parallel to YX, then the angle between GI and JX is also 50°, which would mean that at point G, the angle between GI and JX is 50°. But earlier, we found that at point G, the angle between JX and GZ is 110°, which is ∠XGZ = 110°. If GI is part of GZ, then the angle between JX and GZ at G is 110°, which would mean that the angle between JX and GI is 110°, not 50°. This contradicts the assumption that GI || YX. So, this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, the lines GI and YX are not parallel.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me recall that in triangle XZG, we have angles at X = 50°, at Z = 20°, and at G = 110°. Now, if I can relate this to point I on GZ.

Since I is on GZ, let me consider the location of I on GZ. Let me assume that I divides GZ in some ratio, say GI/IZ = k.

If I can find k, then I can find the angles.

But how?

Let me consider the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ. Let me try to express this in terms of the triangles.

Let me consider triangles JIG and XJG. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, let me use mass point geometry. If I can assign masses based on the given ratio.

Given IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, let me assign masses to points such that the masses are inversely proportional to the lengths.

Let me assume mass at J is m_J, at X is m_X, at G is m_G, at Y is m_Y.

From the ratio IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ, which is IJ/XJ = GJ/YJ.

This suggests that the masses at J and X should balance at I, and similarly for G and Y at I.

Wait, mass point assigns masses such that mass_J / mass_X = XJ / IJ.

Wait, if I is on JY, then the masses at J and Y should satisfy mass_J / mass_Y = YI / IJ.

Similarly, since I is on GZ, the masses at G and Z should satisfy mass_G / mass_Z = ZI / IG.

But I don't know the masses at Z or other points.

This might not be helpful without more information.

Alternatively, since I am running out of ideas, let me try to guess the answer based on the angles I've found.

Earlier, in triangle XZG, we found ∠XGZ = 110°. This angle is at G between JX and GZ.

If I consider line GZ, which contains I, and the angle at G is 110°, and I is on GZ, then maybe the angle at I is related to this.

But how?

Let me consider triangle GIZ. At point G, angle is 110°, at Z, angle is 20°, and at I, angle is ?

Wait, in triangle GIZ, the angles would be at G, Z, and I.

But I don't know the sides, so it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if I consider that at point I, we have line IZ (part of GZ) and line IY (part of JY). The angle between them is ∠YIZ, which is what we need to find.

If I can find this angle using other angles.

Let me consider the full picture. We have several angles:

- At X: ∠JXZ = 50°

- At Z: ∠GZW = 20°

- At G: ∠XGZ = 110°

Now, if I can find the angle at I, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point I is 360°, but I don't know.

Alternatively, consider that line IY is part of JY, and line IZ is part of GZ. If I can find the angle between JY and GZ at point I, which is ∠YIZ.

But to find this angle, I need to know the angle between JY and GZ at I.

Let me consider the lines JY and GZ. They intersect at I. The angle between them is ∠YIZ.

To find this angle, I can use the fact that the sum of angles around point I is 360°, but I need more info.

Alternatively, consider the lines JY and GZ, and use the given ratio to find some relation.

But I'm stuck here.

Let me try to think about the possible answers: 40, 50, 65, 110.

Given that at point Z, we have 20°, and at point X, 50°, and at point G, 110°, which are all multiples of 10°, it's likely the answer is a multiple of 10°.

Looking at the options, 40, 50, 65, 110.

If I consider that in triangle YIZ, ∠YZI = 20°, and if ∠ZYI is 50°, then ∠YIZ = 110°, which is option D. But why would ∠ZYI be 50°?

Alternatively, if ∠ZYI is 70°, then ∠YIZ = 90°, which is not an option. Or if ∠ZYI is 60°, then ∠YIZ = 100°, not an option.

Alternatively, if ∠ZYI is 30°, then ∠YIZ = 130°, not an option.

Wait, but earlier, at point X, we had ∠JXZ = 50°, which might be related.

If I assume that ∠ZYI = 50°, then ∠YIZ = 110°, which is option D. But why would ∠ZYI = 50°?

Because ∠JXZ = 50°, and if there is some symmetry or parallel lines.

Alternatively, if lines J
