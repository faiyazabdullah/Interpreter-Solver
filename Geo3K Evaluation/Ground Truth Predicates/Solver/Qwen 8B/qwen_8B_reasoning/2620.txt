====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that line AC has length x, AB is 15 units long, angle at point C (angle BCA) is 60 degrees, and BC has length y. Also, lines AC and AB are perpendicular. Wait, hold on—perpendicular means they form a right angle. But which angle? The problem says Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(A,B)). So that would mean that lines AC and AB are perpendicular. So the angle between them is 90 degrees. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Let me imagine triangle ABC. Points A, B, C. Let me note down the given information:

- Length of AC = x
- Length of AB = 15
- Angle at C, which is angle BCA, is 60 degrees.
- Lines AC and AB are perpendicular. So angle at A between AC and AB is 90 degrees?

Wait, no. Wait, the lines AC and AB meet at point A. Because Line(A,C) starts at A and goes to C, and Line(A,B) starts at A and goes to B. Therefore, these two lines meet at point A, so their intersection is at A. Therefore, the angle between AC and AB is the angle at A. But the problem states that these lines are perpendicular, so angle at A is 90 degrees. However, there's also an angle at C given as 60 degrees. Hmm. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A, and angle at C is 60 degrees. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So if angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, then angle at B would be 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. That seems possible.

So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A, with angle at C being 60°, making it a 30-60-90 triangle. Wait, but in standard 30-60-90 triangles, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let me recall. In such triangles, the side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60° is √3 times longer, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

But let's check the angles again. If angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, then angle at B is 30°. Therefore, side opposite angle B (which is AC) would be the side opposite 30°, so that should be the shortest side. Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle ABC,

- Right angle at A: so sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at C is 60°, which is angle BCA. So angle at C is between BC and AC. Wait, maybe I need to label the triangle properly.

Let me think again. Let me consider triangle ABC, with vertices A, B, C.

Given that angle at C is angle BCA, meaning vertex at C, with segments CB and CA forming the angle. So angle at C is between CB and CA. Then, since lines AC and AB are perpendicular, that implies that at point A, the angle between AB and AC is 90 degrees. So angle at A is 90°, as mentioned before.

Therefore, triangle ABC has angles:

At A: 90°, at C: 60°, so angle at B is 30°.

Therefore, sides:

Opposite angle A (right angle): BC is the hypotenuse.

Opposite angle B (30°): AC.

Opposite angle C (60°): AB.

Wait, because in a triangle, the side opposite a larger angle is longer. Since angle at C is 60°, which is larger than angle at B (30°), so side opposite angle C (which is AB) should be longer than side opposite angle B (AC). Wait, but AB is given as 15. So AB is opposite angle C (since angle C is at point C, so AB is opposite angle C).

Wait, perhaps I need to use trigonometric ratios here. Let me denote the sides:

In triangle ABC,

- AB = 15 (given)

- AC = x (to find)

- BC = y (unknown)

Angles:

- At A: 90°

- At B: 30°

- At C: 60°

So using trigonometry, for example, in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle equals the opposite side over hypotenuse.

Alternatively, since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let me confirm:

If angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite to it (which is AC) is the shorter leg. The side opposite 60° (angle at C) is AB, which is the longer leg. And hypotenuse BC is twice the shorter leg.

Wait, let me make sure:

In a right-angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are:

- Opposite 30°: length 1

- Opposite 60°: length √3

- Hypotenuse: 2

So, if angle at B is 30°, then side AC (opposite angle B) is the shorter leg. Side AB (opposite angle C, which is 60°) is the longer leg. Hypotenuse BC is twice the shorter leg.

So, given that AB is the longer leg (length 15), then AB corresponds to √3 in the ratio. Therefore, if AB = 15, then the longer leg is 15. So according to the ratio, longer leg = √3 * shorter leg. Therefore:

longer leg / shorter leg = √3 → AB / AC = √3 → 15 / x = √3 → solving for x gives x = 15 / √3 = 5√3 after rationalizing.

Wait, yes! So x would be 15 divided by √3, which simplifies to 5√3. Therefore, the value of x is 5√3, which matches option B.

But wait, let me verify once more. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up which sides correspond to which angles.

Let me re-express:

Since angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B is 30°.

Thus, side opposite angle B is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the side opposite is AC.

Side opposite angle C (60°) is AB.

Hypotenuse is BC, opposite the right angle at A.

Therefore, in terms of ratios:

AB (opposite 60°) is longer leg.

AC (opposite 30°) is shorter leg.

BC (hypotenuse) is twice the shorter leg.

So, AB = longer leg = √3 * shorter leg = √3 * AC.

So AB = √3 * AC → 15 = √3 * x → x = 15 / √3 = 5√3. Yes, same result.

Therefore, x is 5√3, which is option B.

So the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints involving triangle $ \triangle ABC $. Here's the structured breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Structure**
We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(AC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 15 $
- $ \angle BCA = 60^\circ $
- $ \text{Line}(AC) \perp \text{Line}(AB) $

This tells us that:
- The angle between $ AB $ and $ AC $ at point $ A $ is $ 90^\circ $, making $ \triangle ABC $ a **right triangle** with the right angle at $ A $.
- Given $ \angle BCA = 60^\circ $, and knowing the total interior angles of a triangle add to $ 180^\circ $, the remaining angle at $ B $ is:
  $$
  \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ
  $$

So, triangle $ ABC $ is a **30–60–90 triangle**, with angles:
- $ \angle A = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30–60–90 Triangle**

In a 30–60–90 triangle, the sides are in the fixed ratio:
$$
\text{Shortest side} : \text{Middle side} : \text{Longest side} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$
Where:
- The side opposite the $ 30^\circ $ angle is the **shortest side**.
- The side opposite the $ 60^\circ $ angle is the **middle side**.
- The side opposite the $ 90^\circ $ angle is the **hypotenuse** (longest side).

From our triangle:
- $ AB $ lies opposite $ \angle C = 60^\circ $ → Middle side
- $ AC $ lies opposite $ \angle B = 30^\circ $ → Shortest side
- $ BC $ is the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle at $ A $)

---

### **Step 3: Set Up the Ratio Using Given Information**

Let’s denote:
- $ AB = 15 $ → Corresponds to the middle side ($ \sqrt{3} $ part of the ratio)
- $ AC = x $ → Corresponds to the shortest side (1 part of the ratio)

Using the known relationship in a 30–60–90 triangle:
$$
\frac{\text{Middle side}}{\text{Shortest side}} = \sqrt{3}
$$
Substitute values:
$$
\frac{15}{x} = \sqrt{3}
$$
Solving for $ x $:
$$
x = \frac{15}{\sqrt{3}} = 5\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length $ x $, corresponding to side $ AC $, is $ 5\sqrt{3} $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
