MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this geometry problem. So, we have several constraints here, and we need to find the value of x, which is the length of line AG. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, there's an angle at point D, between points E, D, and A. The measure of that angle is 45 degrees. Then, the length of line AE is 8 units. Also, there's another angle at point A, between points D, A, and E, which measures 30 degrees. There's a point G that lies on line DE, and lines GA and GD are perpendicular. Wait, no—the Perpendicular condition says that line GA is perpendicular to line GD? Or is it that line GA is perpendicular to line GD? Let me check again. It says Perpendicular(Line(G, A), Line(G, D)). So, the line GA is perpendicular to line GD. That means that angle at G between GA and GD is 90 degrees. 

So, putting all together: Points D, E, and A form some triangle or configuration. Point G is somewhere on line DE such that GA is perpendicular to GD. Also, angles at D and A are given. Hmm. Maybe I should draw a diagram mentally.

Let me think about triangle ADE. We know angle at D (angle EDA) is 45 degrees, angle at A (angle DAE) is 30 degrees. Wait, but in triangle ADE, the sum of angles should be 180. Let me check: angle at D is 45°, angle at A is 30°, then angle at E would be 180 - 45 - 30 = 105°. But maybe that's not directly useful yet.

But point G is on line DE, and GA is perpendicular to GD. Since G is on DE, then GD is part of line DE. Therefore, GA is perpendicular to DE? Because GD is along DE. Wait, if G is on DE, then line GD is just a segment of DE. So, if GA is perpendicular to GD, then GA is perpendicular to DE. So, GA is an altitude from point A to line DE?

Wait, but point A isn't necessarily on DE. Wait, but GA is perpendicular to GD, which is on DE. So GA is perpendicular to DE. So, GA is the altitude from A to line DE. But since G is on DE, then AG is the altitude from A to DE. Therefore, AG is perpendicular to DE. 

But then, perhaps triangle ADE has an altitude from A to DE, which is AG. And we need to find the length of AG, which is x. Given that AE is 8. Also, angle at D is 45°, angle at A is 30°, etc. Maybe using trigonometry here.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry could help. Let me try setting coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make calculations easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since angle at D is 45°, and angle at A is 30°, perhaps I can position points accordingly. Alternatively, since GA is perpendicular to DE, and G is on DE, maybe I can set up coordinates such that DE is horizontal or vertical for simplicity.

Let me consider line DE as horizontal. Let me assume that DE is along the x-axis. Let me set point D at (0, 0), and point E at (e, 0) for some e. Then, point G is somewhere on DE, say at (g, 0). Now, GA is perpendicular to DE, so GA is vertical because DE is horizontal. Therefore, GA is vertical. Therefore, point A has the same x-coordinate as G. So, if G is at (g, 0), then point A is at (g, k) for some k, since GA is vertical. So, coordinates:

- D: (0, 0)
- E: (e, 0)
- G: (g, 0)
- A: (g, k)

Now, we need to use the given angles. Let's see. First, angle at D (angle EDA) is 45 degrees. Let me compute vectors to find that angle.

At point D (0,0), angle between ED and DA. Vector ED goes from D to E: (e, 0) - (0, 0) = (e, 0). Vector DA goes from D to A: (g, k) - (0, 0) = (g, k). The angle between ED (which is along positive x-axis) and DA is 45 degrees. Therefore, tan(theta) = (k)/g, where theta is the angle between DA and ED (the x-axis). Since theta is 45°, tan(theta) = 1 = k/g => k = g.

Therefore, k = g. So, coordinates of A are (g, g).

Also, angle at A (angle DAE) is 30 degrees. Let me find that angle. At point A, angle between AD and AE. Let's compute vectors AD and AE.

Vector AD goes from A to D: (0 - g, 0 - g) = (-g, -g).
Vector AE goes from A to E: (e - g, 0 - g) = (e - g, -g).

The angle between these two vectors is 30 degrees. Let me use the dot product formula.

Dot product of AD and AE: (-g)(e - g) + (-g)(-g) = -g(e - g) + g² = -ge + g² + g² = -ge + 2g².

Magnitude of AD: sqrt((-g)^2 + (-g)^2) = sqrt(2g²) = g√2.

Magnitude of AE: sqrt((e - g)^2 + (-g)^2) = sqrt[(e - g)^2 + g²].

Then, cos(theta) = [dot product]/[|AD||AE|] = [-ge + 2g²]/[g√2 * sqrt((e - g)^2 + g²)].

We know theta is 30°, so cos(theta) = √3 / 2.

Therefore,

[-ge + 2g²] / [g√2 * sqrt((e - g)^2 + g²)] = √3 / 2.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's another way. Let me recall that AE is given as 8. Wait, LengthOf(Line(A, E)) is 8. From earlier, AE is from point A(g, g) to E(e, 0). So distance between them is sqrt[(e - g)^2 + (0 - g)^2] = sqrt[(e - g)^2 + g²] = 8. So:

sqrt[(e - g)^2 + g²] = 8 → square both sides:

(e - g)^2 + g² = 64. Equation (1).

Also, from the angle at D being 45°, we had k = g. Which was already used.

Additionally, we might need more relations. Let me think.

Since we also know that point A is (g, g), and point D is (0,0). So, line DA connects (0,0) to (g, g). Therefore, the slope of DA is (g - 0)/(g - 0) = 1. So, DA is along the line y = x. Wait, but angle between DA and ED (x-axis) is 45°, which matches our previous conclusion.

Now, angle DAE is 30°, which we tried to express via the dot product. But maybe there's another approach. For example, triangle ADE. Let me think about triangle ADE. If we can find lengths of sides, maybe we can apply the Law of Sines or Cosines.

In triangle ADE, we know angle at D is 45°, angle at A is 30°, so angle at E is 180 - 45 - 30 = 105°, as before. Then, using Law of Sines:

AD / sin(angle at E) = AE / sin(angle at D) = DE / sin(angle at A)

So:

AD / sin(105°) = AE / sin(45°) = DE / sin(30°)

Given that AE = 8, so:

AD / sin(105°) = 8 / sin(45°)

Compute AD:

AD = [sin(105°) / sin(45°)] * 8

First, sin(105°) is sin(60° + 45°) = sin60cos45 + cos60sin45 = (√3/2)(√2/2) + (1/2)(√2/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ ... Well, exact value is needed.

Sin(45°) is √2/2.

Thus:

AD = [(√6 + √2)/4 ] / (√2/2 ) * 8

Simplify denominator first:

Divide by √2/2 is multiplying by 2/√2 = √2.

So:

[(√6 + √2)/4 ] * √2 * 8 = [ (√6 + √2) * √2 / 4 ] * 8

Calculate numerator inside:

(√6 * √2) + (√2 * √2) = √12 + 2 = 2√3 + 2

So:

[ (2√3 + 2 ) / 4 ] * 8 = [ (2(√3 + 1))/4 ] * 8 = [ (√3 + 1)/2 ] * 8 = 4(√3 + 1 )

So AD = 4(√3 + 1 ). 

But wait, AD is the length from D(0,0) to A(g, g). Which is sqrt(g² + g²) = g√2. So:

g√2 = 4(√3 + 1 ) → g = [4(√3 + 1 ) ] / √2 = 4(√3 + 1 ) / √2

Rationalizing denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

g = 4(√3 + 1 )√2 / 2 = 2√2(√3 + 1 )

So, g = 2√2(√3 + 1 )

Hmm, okay. Now, remember that AE is 8. Earlier, we had equation (1):

(e - g)^2 + g² = 64. So, need to find e.

But how?

From triangle ADE, we can also find DE. Using Law of Sines:

DE / sin(30°) = AE / sin(45°)

So DE = [ sin(30° ) / sin(45° ) ] * AE = [ (1/2) / (√2/2 ) ] * 8 = [1/√2 ] * 8 = 8 / √2 = 4√2.

So DE = 4√2. Since DE is the distance between D(0,0) and E(e, 0), which is |e - 0| = |e|. Assuming e > 0, then e = DE = 4√2. Therefore, e = 4√2.

So now, we know e = 4√2, and we have equation (1): (e - g)^2 + g² = 64.

Plugging e = 4√2 into this:

(4√2 - g)^2 + g² = 64.

Expand (4√2 - g)^2:

= (4√2)^2 - 2*4√2*g + g² = 32 - 8√2 g + g²

Adding g² gives total expression:

32 - 8√2 g + g² + g² = 32 - 8√2 g + 2g² = 64.

Thus:

2g² - 8√2 g + 32 - 64 = 0 → 2g² - 8√2 g - 32 = 0.

Divide both sides by 2:

g² - 4√2 g - 16 = 0.

Solving quadratic equation for g:

g = [4√2 ± sqrt( (4√2)^2 + 4*1*16 ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(4√2)^2 + 64 = 32 + 64 = 96.

So sqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) = 4√6.

Thus,

g = [4√2 ± 4√6 ] / 2 = 2√2 ± 2√6.

But since e = 4√2 and point G is on DE (from D(0,0) to E(4√2, 0)), the coordinate g must be between 0 and 4√2. Let's check both solutions.

First solution: 2√2 + 2√6. Let's approximate values:

√2 ≈ 1.414, √6 ≈ 2.449.

So 2√2 ≈ 2.828, 2√6 ≈ 4.898. Sum ≈ 7.726. But e = 4√2 ≈ 5.656. So 7.726 > 5.656 → invalid, since G must lie between D(0) and E(4√2). 

Second solution: 2√2 - 2√6 ≈ 2.828 - 4.898 ≈ -2.07. Negative value, meaning left of D(0,0). But depending on the direction, maybe possible? However, if G is allowed to be extended beyond D, but usually unless specified, points on a line segment DE would be between D and E. However, the problem states "PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(D, E))", so G can be anywhere on the line DE, not necessarily between D and E. But given that GA is perpendicular to DE, which is horizontal, and A is at (g, g). If g is negative, then A would be at (negative, negative), but then angle at D may still hold. But perhaps we need to check.

However, given that in our previous calculation for AD, we had AD = g√2, which came from the coordinates. If g were negative, then AD would be positive, but the angle at D is 45°, which is consistent regardless of direction. But let's proceed.

But let's check whether both solutions are valid. However, given that in our initial assumption when computing AD, we had AD = g√2. If g is negative, then AD would be positive, but the actual length is absolute value. However, since we derived g based on the angle, which depends on direction. Wait, but earlier steps assumed that vector DA is going from D(0,0) to A(g, g). If g is negative, then DA would go towards negative x and y. But the angle between ED (positive x-axis) and DA would still be 45°, measured as the angle between positive x-axis and DA, which would be 225°, but the angle between ED and DA is considered as the smaller angle, so maybe 45°? Wait, angles in triangles are always between 0 and 180, so even if DA is pointing southwest, the angle between ED (east) and DA would be 180 - 45 = 135°, but we were told that angle EDA is 45°, so that suggests that the angle is acute. Hence, g must be positive. Therefore, the second solution with negative g is invalid. Thus, only the first solution is invalid (as it's larger than e), but both are problematic. Wait, this suggests inconsistency. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, earlier, when solving for g, we had two roots. One is positive and greater than e, the other negative. But neither fits within DE. What does this mean? Perhaps my assumption of coordinates is wrong?

Wait, let me retrace. When I set up the coordinate system, I assumed that point G is on line DE, which extends infinitely in both directions. But if the angle at D is 45°, and given that angle DAE is 30°, perhaps G is outside segment DE. Wait, but the problem didn't specify whether G is between D and E or not. So maybe G is beyond E or beyond D.

If g is positive but greater than e, which is 4√2, then G is beyond E. Let me check with the first solution: g = 2√2 + 2√6. Let me calculate its numerical value:

√2 ≈ 1.414, √6 ≈ 2.449.

So 2√2 ≈ 2.828, 2√6 ≈ 4.898. Adding gives approx 7.726. While e = 4√2 ≈ 5.656. So yes, g is beyond E. So G is located beyond E on the line DE.

But then, the coordinates of A are (g, g). So A is above the line DE, with x-coordinate equal to g. Then, angle at A is 30°, which we might need to verify. But maybe that's okay.

But then, proceeding with this value of g, even though it's beyond E. So let's take g = 2√2 + 2√6. Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me double-check the equations.

Earlier, we had from Law of Sines:

AD = 4(√3 + 1 ), and also AD = g√2. So:

g√2 = 4(√3 + 1 )

Therefore, g = 4(√3 + 1 ) / √2 = 4(√3 + 1 ) * √2 / 2 = 2√2(√3 + 1 )

Which is approximately 2*1.414*(1.732 + 1 ) = 2.828*(2.732) ≈ 7.72, which matches the earlier approximation. And e = 4√2 ≈ 5.656. So indeed, g is larger than e, meaning G is beyond E.

So, moving forward with this. Now, the question asks for x, which is the length of AG. Since A is at (g, g) and G is at (g, 0), because G is on DE (the x-axis) at (g, 0). So AG is vertical distance from (g, g) to (g, 0), which is simply |g - 0| = g. Wait, no! Wait, AG is the distance between A(g, g) and G(g, 0). So yes, it's sqrt[(g - g)^2 + (0 - g)^2] = sqrt[0 + g²] = |g|. Since g is positive, x = g. Therefore, x equals g. So, x = g = 2√2(√3 + 1 ).

Wait, but that's not among the answer choices. Let me check the options again:

A. 4  
B. 4√2  
C. 4√3  
D. 8  

Hmm. My current result is 2√2(√3 + 1 ). Let me compute that numerically:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so √3 + 1 ≈ 2.732. Multiply by 2√2 ≈ 2.828. So 2.828 * 2.732 ≈ let's approximate:

2.828 * 2.732 ≈ 2.828 * 2.7 ≈ 7.6356, plus 2.828 * 0.032 ≈ ~0.09, total ≈ 7.725. So approximately 7.72. None of the answer choices are close to that. Wait, but this suggests that either my approach is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: Use triangle ADE with known angles and side AE = 8.

As previously, in triangle ADE, angles are 45°, 30°, 105°, with AE = 8 opposite angle D (45°). Wait, no: in triangle ADE, angle at D is 45°, angle at A is 30°, so side opposite angle D is AE. Wait, no:

Wait, in triangle ADE, each angle corresponds to the opposite side. So:

Angle at D is 45°, so the side opposite is AE.

Angle at A is 30°, so the side opposite is DE.

Angle at E is 105°, so the side opposite is AD.

Therefore, using Law of Sines:

AE / sin(angle D) = DE / sin(angle A) = AD / sin(angle E)

So:

AE / sin(45°) = DE / sin(30°)

We know AE = 8, so:

8 / sin(45°) = DE / (1/2)

Thus, DE = 8 * (1/2) / sin(45°) = 4 / (√2/2) = 4 * 2 / √2 = 8 / √2 = 4√2. Which matches our earlier result.

Similarly, AD = [sin(105°) / sin(45°)] * AE = [sin(105°)/sin(45°)] * 8.

As computed earlier, sin(105°) = sin(60°+45°)= (√6 + √2)/4, and sin(45°)=√2/2. So:

AD = [ (√6 + √2)/4 ] / (√2/2 ) * 8 = [ (√6 + √2)/4 * 2/√2 ] * 8 = [ (√6 + √2)/(2√2) ] * 8 = [ (√6 + √2)/√2 ] * 4.

Simplify:

Break down terms:

√6 / √2 = √(6/2) = √3

√2 / √2 = 1

So overall:

[ √3 + 1 ] * 4 = 4(√3 + 1 )

So AD = 4(√3 + 1 ). As before.

Now, since AG is the height from A to DE, and in triangle ADE, the area can be expressed as (base * height)/2. So, if we take DE as base, then AG is the height.

Area of triangle ADE can also be calculated using two different expressions.

First, using sides and angles. For example, Area = (1/2)*AD*AE*sin(angle between them). Wait, angle between AD and AE is angle at A, which is 30°. So:

Area = (1/2)*AD*AE*sin(30°)

Plug in values:

AD = 4(√3 + 1 ), AE = 8, sin(30°) = 1/2.

So Area = 0.5 * 4(√3 + 1 ) * 8 * 0.5 = 0.5 * 4 * 8 * 0.5 * (√3 + 1 ) = 0.5 * 4 * 4 * (√3 + 1 ) = 8(√3 + 1 )

Alternatively, Area = (1/2)*DE*AG, since DE is the base and AG is the height.

We know DE = 4√2, so:

8(√3 + 1 ) = 0.5 * 4√2 * AG → Solve for AG:

AG = [8(√3 + 1 )] / [0.5 * 4√2 ] = [8(√3 + 1 )] / [2√2 ] = 4(√3 + 1 ) / √2 = same as before, rationalize:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

AG = 4(√3 + 1 )√2 / 2 = 2√2(√3 + 1 )

Same result as before. So x = AG = 2√2(√3 + 1 ). Numerically, this is approximately 2*1.414*(1.732 + 1) ≈ 2.828*2.732 ≈ 7.72, which is not matching any of the answer choices. This suggests that either my reasoning is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding of the problem.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement carefully.

The problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, E, A)), 45). So Angle at E? Wait, wait—Angle(D, E, A) is the angle at point E between points D, E, A. Wait, earlier I thought it was angle at D, but that's a critical error!

Oh no! I misread the angle. Let me recheck:

Original problem says:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, E, A)), 45). So, the angle is at point E, between D-E-A. So, angle at E is 45°, not at D. Similarly, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, E)), 30). Angle at D between A-D-E, i.e., angle at D is 30°. Oh wow, this changes everything! I had it backwards. So my entire previous analysis was wrong due to misreading the angles. Let me start over with corrected understanding.

Corrected angles:

- Angle at E (between D-E-A) is 45°.
- Angle at D (between A-D-E) is 30°.
- Point G is on line DE, and GA is perpendicular to GD (so GA ⊥ DE, since GD is part of DE).

So, let's redefine:

In triangle ADE, angle at D is 30°, angle at E is 45°, therefore angle at A is 180 - 30 - 45 = 105°.

Given that AE = 8. Need to find AG, which is the length from A to G, where G is on DE such that GA ⊥ DE.

So, similar approach as before, but with corrected angles.

Let me redo the Law of Sines approach.

In triangle ADE, angles:

- At D: 30°
- At E: 45°
- At A: 105°

Side AE is opposite angle D (30°), so:

Using Law of Sines:

AE / sin(angle D) = DE / sin(angle A) = AD / sin(angle E)

Given AE = 8, angle D = 30°, angle A = 105°, angle E = 45°.

So:

AE / sin(30°) = DE / sin(105°)

=> 8 / (1/2) = DE / sin(105°)

=> 16 = DE / sin(105°)

=> DE = 16 * sin(105°)

Calculate sin(105°) = sin(60° + 45°) = sin60*cos45 + cos60*sin45 = (√3/2)(√2/2) + (1/2)(√2/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4

Thus, DE = 16 * (√6 + √2)/4 = 4(√6 + √2)

Similarly, AD can be found via Law of Sines:

AD / sin(angle E) = AE / sin(angle D)

AD / sin(45°) = 8 / sin(30°)

AD = [sin(45°)/sin(30°)] * 8 = [ (√2/2) / (1/2) ] * 8 = √2 * 8 = 8√2.

So AD = 8√2.

Now, back to finding AG, which is the height from A to DE. In triangle ADE, area is (1/2)*DE*AG = (1/2)*base*height.

Also, area can be calculated using other pairs of sides and angles. For example, using sides AD and AE with included angle at A.

Wait, angle at A is 105°, so area = (1/2)*AD*AE*sin(angle A).

So:

Area = 0.5 * AD * AE * sin(105°)

Plugging in values:

AD = 8√2, AE = 8, sin(105°) = (√6 + √2)/4.

So:

Area = 0.5 * 8√2 * 8 * (√6 + √2)/4 = Simplify step by step:

First, 0.5 * 8 * 8 = 0.5 * 64 = 32.

Then, multiply by √2 * (√6 + √2)/4.

So:

Area = 32 * √2 * (√6 + √2)/4 = 8 * √2 * (√6 + √2)

Let me expand that:

8 * [√2*√6 + √2*√2] = 8 * [√12 + 2] = 8 * [2√3 + 2] = 16√3 + 16.

Alternatively, using the other expression for area:

Area = (1/2)*DE*AG = 0.5 * DE * AG.

DE is 4(√6 + √2), so:

Area = 0.5 * 4(√6 + √2) * AG = 2(√6 + √2) * AG.

Setting equal to previous expression:

2(√6 + √2) * AG = 16√3 + 16.

Solve for AG:

AG = (16√3 + 16) / [2(√6 + √2)] = [16(√3 + 1)] / [2(√6 + √2)] = 8(√3 + 1) / (√6 + √2).

Simplify this expression. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (√6 - √2):

AG = [8(√3 + 1)(√6 - √2)] / [ (√6 + √2)(√6 - √2) ]

Denominator becomes (√6)^2 - (√2)^2 = 6 - 2 = 4.

Numerator: 8(√3 + 1)(√6 - √2).

Let me expand (√3 + 1)(√6 - √2):

= √3*√6 - √3*√2 + 1*√6 - 1*√2

= √18 - √6 + √6 - √2

Simplify:

√18 = √(9*2) = 3√2

So:

3√2 - √6 + √6 - √2 = (3√2 - √2) + (-√6 + √6) = 2√2 + 0 = 2√2.

Therefore, numerator becomes 8 * 2√2 = 16√2.

Denominator is 4, so AG = 16√2 / 4 = 4√2.

Ah! So AG = 4√2. Which is option B.

So the correct answer is B. 4√2.

This makes sense. My earlier confusion stemmed from misreading the angles, but correcting that led to the right calculation. Let me confirm once more.

Yes, after correcting the angles, the height AG comes out to 4√2, which is option B. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the length of line segment $ AG $, we begin by interpreting the given geometric constraints and applying appropriate theorems and relationships.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We are given the following key facts:

- $ \angle D E A = 45^\circ $
- $ \angle A D E = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle D A E = 105^\circ $ (since the angles of a triangle add up to $ 180^\circ $)
- $ AE = 8 $
- $ G $ lies on line $ DE $
- $ GA \perp GD $

From this, we can conclude that $ G $ is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point $ A $ onto line $ DE $. Therefore, $ AG $ is the **altitude** from vertex $ A $ to the base $ DE $ of triangle $ ADE $.

---

### **Step 2: Applying the Law of Sines in Triangle $ ADE $**

Using the Law of Sines:

$$
\frac{AE}{\sin(\angle D)} = \frac{DE}{\sin(\angle A)} = \frac{AD}{\sin(\angle E)}
$$

Substitute known values:

- $ \angle D = 30^\circ $, $ \angle A = 105^\circ $, $ \angle E = 45^\circ $
- $ AE = 8 $

$$
\frac{8}{\sin(30^\circ)} = \frac{DE}{\sin(105^\circ)} \Rightarrow \frac{8}{1/2} = \frac{DE}{\sin(105^\circ)} \Rightarrow 16 = \frac{DE}{\sin(105^\circ)}
$$

$$
DE = 16 \cdot \sin(105^\circ)
$$

Recall:

$$
\sin(105^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ + 45^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ)\cos(45^\circ) + \cos(60^\circ)\sin(45^\circ)
$$

$$
\sin(105^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}
$$

$$
DE = 16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} = 4(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})
$$

### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of Triangle $ ADE $**

Use two methods to calculate the area of triangle $ ADE $:

#### Method 1: Using Base $ DE $ and Height $ AG $

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot DE \cdot AG
$$

#### Method 2: Using Two Sides and Included Angle

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot AE \cdot \sin(\angle A)
$$

We already calculated $ DE = 4(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) $, and $ AE = 8 $. To find $ AD $, use Law of Sines again:

$$
\frac{AD}{\sin(\angle E)} = \frac{AE}{\sin(\angle D)} \Rightarrow \frac{AD}{\sin(45^\circ)} = \frac{8}{\sin(30^\circ)} = 16
$$

$$
AD = 16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2}
$$

Now compute the area:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8\sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \sin(105^\circ)
$$

Again, $ \sin(105^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} $, so:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8\sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} = 8\sqrt{2} \cdot (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})
$$

$$
\text{Area} = 8\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) = 8(\sqrt{12} + \sqrt{4}) = 8(2\sqrt{3} + 2) = 16\sqrt{3} + 16
$$

### **Step 4: Solving for $ AG $**

Set the two expressions for area equal:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot DE \cdot AG = 16\sqrt{3} + 16
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) \cdot AG = 16\sqrt{3} + 16
$$

$$
2(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) \cdot AG = 16\sqrt{3} + 16
$$

$$
AG = \frac{16\sqrt{3} + 16}{2(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}
$$

Factor numerator:

$$
AG = \frac{16(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})} = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}
$$

Now simplify by rationalizing the denominator:

$$
AG = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{6 - 2} = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{4}
$$

$$
AG = 2(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})
$$

Expanding the numerator:

$$
(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{18} - \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{18} - \sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}
$$

$$
AG = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}
$$
