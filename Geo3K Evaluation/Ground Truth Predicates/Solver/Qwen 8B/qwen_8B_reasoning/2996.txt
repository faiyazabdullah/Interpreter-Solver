MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a parallelogram PQRS. The question is asking for the length of QP. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram first.

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other. But wait, the problem mentions some specific measurements. Let me note down the given information:

- Length of line PS is 3 units. Since it's a parallelogram, PS should be equal to QR because opposite sides are equal. Wait, but maybe I need to visualize the parallelogram properly. Let me think about how the points are arranged.

Parallelogram PQRS – typically, the vertices are labeled in order such that PQ is adjacent to QR, RS, and SP. So the sides would be PQ, QR, RS, SP. Therefore, opposite sides are PQ and RS, QR and SP. Wait, so if PS is one side, then PS is adjacent to PQ and SR? Hmm, perhaps I need to draw a rough sketch mentally.

Let me label the parallelogram as follows: Points P, Q, R, S connected in order. So PQ is one side, QR is next, RS is next, SP closes the shape. So in that case, opposite sides are PQ and RS, QR and SP. So if PS is a side, that would be connecting P to S. Wait, in a parallelogram, the sides are PQ, QR, RS, SP. So PS would actually be a diagonal, unless the labeling is different. Wait, hold on. Maybe I got the order wrong.

Wait, another way: In a parallelogram, the order of the letters matters. If it's PQRS, then the sides are PQ, QR, RS, SP. So the sides are PQ, QR, RS, SP. Then the diagonals would be PR and QS. So the sides adjacent to point P are PQ and PS. Wait, no, because if you go from P to Q to R to S to P, then the sides adjacent to P are PQ and PS. Wait, that can't be right. Because after Q comes R, so from Q to R, then R to S, then S back to P. So the sides adjacent to P are PQ (from P to Q) and SP (from S to P). So the sides adjacent to P are PQ and SP. Therefore, the opposite sides would be PQ opposite to SR, and PS opposite to QR. Wait, that might make sense.

So, given that, the length of PS is given as 3. So PS is one of the sides. Since opposite sides are equal, then QR must also be equal to PS, so QR = 3. However, there's also another given: Measure of angle PQR is 128 degrees. Wait, the angle at point Q between points P, Q, R. So angle PQR is at vertex Q, between P-Q-R. 

But the problem says to find QP. Wait, QP is the same as PQ, since they're just the same segment but reversed. So QP is the length of side PQ. So we need to find PQ. 

Given that, let's see. We know PS is 3. Since PS is opposite to QR, so QR = PS = 3. Also, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So PQ equals SR, and QR equals PS. So PQ is equal to SR. But we don't know PQ yet. 

But wait, do we have any other information? There's the measure of angle PQR which is 128 degrees. How does that help us? Well, maybe using the Law of Cosines? Or maybe some properties of parallelograms?

Alternatively, since we have two sides and an included angle, but we need more info. Wait, but maybe we can use triangle properties. For example, if we consider triangle PQR. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel. So maybe triangles formed by the diagonals?

Wait, but the problem gives the length of SR as 5. Wait, let me check again the given constraints:

The user wrote:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(P, S)), 3) → so PS = 3.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(P, Q, R)), 128) → angle at Q, between P, Q, R is 128 degrees.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(S, R)), 5) → SR = 5.

Wait, Line(S, R) is SR. So SR is 5. But earlier, since in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So SR is equal to PQ. Because PQ and SR are opposite sides. So PQ = SR = 5. Wait, but that would mean QP is 5. Which is option B. But let me confirm.

Wait, if SR is 5, then PQ is equal to SR, so PQ = 5. Hence QP is 5. But why was the angle given? Did I miss something here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which sides are opposite. Let me re-examine the structure of the parallelogram.

If the parallelogram is PQRS, then the sides are PQ, QR, RS, SP. So opposite sides are PQ || RS and QR || SP. Therefore, PQ equals RS, and QR equals SP. Given that, if SR is given as 5, then SR is the same as PQ. So PQ = SR = 5. Therefore, QP is 5. So answer is B. But why is the angle given? Maybe there's confusion in the problem setup?

Wait, maybe I misread the given lengths. Let me check again:

Original problem says:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(P, S)), 3) → PS = 3.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(S, R)), 5) → SR = 5.

Therefore, since PS is one side, and SR is another side. In a parallelogram, adjacent sides. Wait, PS and SR are adjacent sides meeting at point S. So in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are PQ and PS, etc. Wait, if PS is one side (length 3), and SR is another side (length 5). So those are adjacent sides. Therefore, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are PQ and PS, then QR and RS, etc. Wait, but if PS and SR are adjacent sides, then their lengths are 3 and 5 respectively. So in that case, the sides of the parallelogram are 3 and 5. Therefore, the opposite sides are equal, so PQ is equal to SR (which is 5), and QR is equal to PS (which is 3). Therefore, PQ is 5, which would make QP equal to 5. So answer is B. 

But why was the angle given? Is there a possibility that the diagram isn't a standard parallelogram? Or maybe the angle is important for something else? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have a parallelogram PQRS. So the sides PQ and SR are equal, and QR and PS are equal. Now, the angle at Q is given as 128 degrees. But if we have sides PQ and QR adjacent to angle Q. Wait, angle PQR is at Q, between P-Q-R. So that angle is between sides PQ and QR. So in that case, if we know the lengths of PQ and QR, and the included angle, could we compute something else? But the problem isn't asking for area or anything else. It's directly asking for QP, which is PQ. 

Wait, but according to the given data, we already have SR = 5. Since SR is equal to PQ, then PQ = 5. Therefore, regardless of the angle, the answer is 5. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the labels.

Wait, maybe the problem is not a parallelogram but a different quadrilateral? No, the problem states it's a parallelogram. So the key is that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, if SR is given as 5, then PQ is 5. Therefore, the answer is B. 

But why include the angle? Maybe to trick us into thinking we need to use trigonometry? But the problem didn't give any other sides. Let me check once more. 

Another thought: Could the angle affect the side lengths? For example, in a non-parallelogram, but since it's a parallelogram, the side lengths are fixed once the opposite sides are determined. The angle affects the shape but not the side lengths. So even if the angle is 128 degrees, the side lengths remain as per the opposite sides. 

Therefore, the answer is B. 5. So the correct choice is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ QP $ in the parallelogram $ PQRS $, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and applying the fundamental properties of parallelograms.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Structure

We are told that $ PQRS $ is a **parallelogram**, meaning:
- Opposite sides are **equal** in length.
- Opposite angles are **equal**.
- Adjacent angles are **supplementary** (i.e., sum to $ 180^\circ $).
- Diagonals **bisect each other**.

The given values are:
- $ \text{Length}(PS) = 3 $
- $ \angle PQR = 128^\circ $
- $ \text{Length}(SR) = 5 $

Note: $ PS $ and $ SR $ are **adjacent sides** of the parallelogram, meeting at point $ S $. Thus, these are **not** opposite sides.

---

### Step 2: Use Parallelogram Side Properties

In a parallelogram:
- Opposite sides are equal. That means:
  - $ PQ = SR $
  - $ QR = PS $

From the given:
- $ SR = 5 $ ⇒ $ PQ = SR = 5 $
- $ PS = 3 $ ⇒ $ QR = PS = 3 $

Thus, the side $ QP $ (which is the same as $ PQ $) has length **5**.

---

### Step 3: Confirming the Role of the Angle

Although the angle $ \angle PQR = 128^\circ $ is given, it is irrelevant for determining the side length $ QP $. This is because the side lengths in a parallelogram are solely determined by the equality of opposite sides — the angles only influence the shape (e.g., whether it’s a rectangle or rhombus), but not the side lengths themselves.

---

### Final Conclusion

Since $ QP $ corresponds to side $ PQ $, and we've established that $ PQ = SR = 5 $, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

Final Answer: B
