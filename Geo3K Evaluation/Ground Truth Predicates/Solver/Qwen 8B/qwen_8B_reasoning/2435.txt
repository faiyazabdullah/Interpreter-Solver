MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC, right? The angles at different points are given. Let me parse the information again.

First, it says that the measure of angle C, A, B is 25 degrees. Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. In geometry, when they write Angle(C, A, B), that should mean the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, no, maybe I need to recall how angle notation works. Typically, Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at point Y formed by points X, Y, Z. So, Angle(C, A, B) would be the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, but that might not make sense because the middle letter is the vertex. So, Angle(C, A, B) is the angle at point A, with segments AC and AB forming the angle. So, that would be angle CAB, which is angle at A between CA and AB. But then the next part says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, A)), x). So, Angle(B, C, A) is the angle at point C between points B and A. That would be angle BCA, which is the angle at C between BC and CA. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), 40). So, Angle(A, B, C) is the angle at point B between points A and C, so that's angle ABC.

So putting it all together:

- Angle at A (angle CAB) is 25 degrees.
- Angle at C (angle BCA) is x degrees.
- Angle at B (angle ABC) is 40 degrees.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me confirm. If the first angle is Angle(C, A, B), that's angle at A, so angle CAB = 25°. Then Angle(B, C, A) is angle at C, so angle BCA = x. And Angle(A, B, C) is angle at B, so angle ABC = 40°. 

Now, in a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Therefore, adding up all three angles:

Angle at A + Angle at B + Angle at C = 180°

Which translates to:

25° + 40° + x = 180°

Adding 25 and 40 gives 65°, so 65° + x = 180°, meaning x = 180° - 65° = 115°. 

But looking at the answer choices, option D is 115. So that would be the answer. Wait, but let me check again if I interpreted the angles correctly. Because if there was a mistake in identifying which angle is which, the calculation could be wrong.

Let me re-express each angle:

Original problem:

Angle(C, A, B): This is angle at A, since the middle letter is the vertex. So, angle CAB = 25°.

Angle(B, C, A): Middle letter is C, so angle at C between B and A. That's angle BCA = x.

Angle(A, B, C): Middle letter is B, so angle at B between A and C. That's angle ABC = 40°.

Yes, so those are the three angles. Therefore, their sum is 25 + 40 + x = 180 => x = 115. Which matches option D. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose the triangle is labeled differently. For example, maybe the points are arranged such that the angles aren't the ones I thought. Wait, but regardless of the triangle's shape, the sum of angles is always 180. So unless there's some other constraint, like if it's not a triangle, but the problem mentions angles in a triangle. Wait, but the way the angles are given suggests it's a triangle. Because angle CAB, angle ABC, angle BCA are all parts of triangle ABC. So yes, the sum has to be 180. Hence, x=115. So answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by interpreting the given geometric constraints based on standard angle notation. Each angle is defined as follows:

- **Angle(C, A, B)** corresponds to the angle at vertex $ A $, denoted as $ \angle CAB $.  
- **Angle(B, C, A)** corresponds to the angle at vertex $ C $, denoted as $ \angle BCA $.  
- **Angle(A, B, C)** corresponds to the angle at vertex $ B $, denoted as $ \angle ABC $.

Thus, the given values translate into:
- $ \angle CAB = 25^\circ $
- $ \angle ABC = 40^\circ $
- $ \angle BCA = x $

---

### Step 1: Use the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem

In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles equals $ 180^\circ $. Applying this theorem to triangle $ ABC $:

$$
\angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
25^\circ + 40^\circ + x = 180^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 180^\circ - (25^\circ + 40^\circ) = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The value of $ x $ is $ 115^\circ $, which corresponds to **option D**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: D}}
