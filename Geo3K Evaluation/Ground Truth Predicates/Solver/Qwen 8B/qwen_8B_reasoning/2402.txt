====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with radius 13 inches. There are several points mentioned: C, D, B, and X. The problem states that point X lies on two lines: one connecting O and B, and another connecting C and D. Also, points C, D, and B are on the circle centered at O with radius 13. Additionally, there's a condition that line XB is perpendicular to line XD. We need to find the length OX.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the situation. Let me imagine circle O with center at O. Points C, D, and B are on the circumference since they lie on the circle with radius 13. Now, line CD is a chord of the circle because it connects two points on the circle. The problem mentions that OB is perpendicular to CD. Wait, but the problem says that line XB is perpendicular to line XD. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long." Oh, so OB is perpendicular to CD. But then there's also the condition that line XB is perpendicular to line XD. So maybe there are two different perpendicularity conditions here?

Let me parse the problem again:

Given:

- Point LIES ON LINE (X, Line(O,B)) → So X is on line OB.

- Point LIES ON LINE (X, Line(C,D)) → So X is also on line CD.

So X is the intersection point of lines OB and CD. Therefore, X is the intersection of OB and CD. But since OB is perpendicular to CD (as per the given statement), then lines OB and CD intersect at right angles. However, since X is their intersection, then the lines OB and CD meet at X, forming a right angle. 

But wait, the problem says that OB is perpendicular to CD. So line OB is perpendicular to line CD. Hence, their intersection point X would form a right angle between them. Therefore, triangle XBD? Or something else?

Also, CD is a chord of the circle, which is 24 inches long. Since CD is a chord, and OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB must pass through the midpoint of CD. Because in a circle, if a radius is perpendicular to a chord, then it bisects the chord. Wait, but OB is a radius, as it goes from the center O to point B on the circle. However, CD is a chord. If OB is perpendicular to CD, then the line OB must pass through the midpoint of CD. Therefore, the midpoint of CD lies on OB.

But X is the intersection point of OB and CD. Therefore, X is the midpoint of CD. Wait, but CD is 24 inches long, so its midpoint divides it into segments of 12 inches each. Therefore, CX = XD = 12 inches. However, the problem states that line XB is perpendicular to line XD. Wait, but if X is the midpoint of CD, then XD is half of CD, which is 12 inches. Then line XB is perpendicular to XD. So triangle XBD is a right triangle at X?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.

Let me place the circle O at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that CD is horizontal for simplicity, since OB is perpendicular to CD. Let me suppose that CD is horizontal, so OB is vertical. Let me set up coordinates such that the midpoint of CD is at some point along the y-axis, since OB is perpendicular to CD and passes through its midpoint.

Wait, since OB is a radius, and it's perpendicular to CD, then OB passes through the midpoint of CD. Let me denote M as the midpoint of CD. Then OM is the line from the center O to the midpoint M of CD. But since OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB must coincide with OM? Wait, no. Wait, OB is a radius, meaning it starts at O and ends at point B on the circle. If OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB is the line that is perpendicular to CD and passes through the midpoint of CD. Therefore, point B is located along the line OM, which is the same line as OB. Therefore, point B is the endpoint of the radius OM extended to the circumference. Wait, but if CD is a chord, then the distance from the center O to the chord CD can be calculated using the formula: d = sqrt(r² - (c/2)²), where c is the length of the chord. Here, CD is 24 inches, so c=24. Then the distance from O to CD is sqrt(13² - (24/2)^2) = sqrt(169 - 144) = sqrt(25) = 5 inches. Therefore, the distance from O to CD is 5 inches. That means that the midpoint M of CD is 5 inches away from O. Therefore, OM = 5 inches.

But since OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB is the line passing through O and M. Wait, but OB is a radius, so the length OB is 13 inches. Wait, but if OM is 5 inches, then MB would be OB - OM = 13 - 5 = 8 inches. Wait, but maybe I need to think more carefully.

Let me formalize this. Let me take coordinate system with O at (0,0). Let me assume that CD is horizontal, lying along the x-axis, and the midpoint M of CD is at (h, 0). The distance from O to CD is |OM|, which is h units. From earlier calculation, the distance from O to CD is 5 inches, so h = 5 or -5. Let me take h positive, so M is at (5, 0). Therefore, CD is a horizontal chord with midpoint at (5,0), and length 24 inches. Therefore, the coordinates of C and D are (5 - 12, 0) and (5 + 12, 0), which is (-7, 0) and (17, 0). Wait, but the distance between C and D would be 17 - (-7) = 24 inches, yes. However, these points C(-7,0) and D(17,0) lie on the circle centered at O(0,0) with radius 13. Let me verify that. For example, point D is at (17,0). Its distance from O is sqrt(17² + 0²) = 17, but the radius is 13. Wait, that's impossible! So my assumption is wrong here. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, here's the mistake. The distance from O to CD is 5 inches, so the midpoint M is at distance 5 from O. Therefore, if the midpoint M is at (a, b), then the distance OM is 5. However, in my previous setup, I assumed CD was horizontal along x-axis with midpoint at (5,0), leading to points C and D being (-7,0) and (17,0). But then the distance from O to D is 17, which exceeds the radius 13. That's incorrect. Therefore, my mistake was assuming that the midpoint M is along the x-axis. Wait, but how?

The formula for the distance from the center to the chord is d = sqrt(r² - (c/2)²). Here, r=13, c=24. So d = sqrt(13² - 12²) = sqrt(169 - 144) = sqrt(25) = 5. So the distance from O to CD is 5 inches. Therefore, the midpoint M of CD is 5 inches away from O. So, if I want to set coordinates accordingly, I can place M at (0,5) for simplicity, making CD horizontal. Wait, but then CD would be horizontal, and the midpoint M is vertically above O. Wait, maybe better to have CD horizontal with midpoint M at (0,5). Let me try that.

Let me place the midpoint M of CD at (0,5). Then CD is horizontal, so points C and D are symmetric around M. The length of CD is 24, so each half is 12. Therefore, coordinates of C and D would be (-12, 5) and (12, 5). Wait, but then the distance from O(0,0) to point C(-12,5) is sqrt((-12)^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. Perfect! So that works. So C is (-12,5), D is (12,5), midpoint M is (0,5). Then CD is the chord from (-12,5) to (12,5), which is indeed 24 inches long. And the distance from O to CD is 5 inches, which matches our calculation.

Now, line CD is horizontal, going from (-12,5) to (12,5). The line OB is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is horizontal, OB must be vertical. Therefore, line OB is vertical. Since O is at (0,0), and line OB is vertical, then point B is somewhere along the y-axis. But since B lies on the circle of radius 13, its coordinates are (0,y) where y^2 = 13^2 ⇒ y = ±13. Therefore, point B could be (0,13) or (0,-13). Let me pick B as (0,13) for simplicity.

So, line OB is the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,13). Now, point X is the intersection of line OB (the y-axis) and line CD (which is horizontal at y=5). Therefore, solving for the intersection of x=0 and y=5 gives X=(0,5). Wait, but that's the midpoint M of CD. However, according to the problem statement, X lies on both line OB and line CD, so X is the midpoint M. But then, the problem also states that Perpendicular(Line(X,B), Line(X,D)). Wait, but if X is (0,5), then line XB is from (0,5) to (0,13), which is vertical. Line XD is from (0,5) to D(12,5), which is horizontal. So the lines XB (vertical) and XD (horizontal) are indeed perpendicular. So that checks out.

Therefore, X is the midpoint M of CD, which is at (0,5). Then OX is the distance from O(0,0) to X(0,5), which is 5 inches. Therefore, the answer should be A. 5.

Wait, but looking back at the answer choices, option A is 5. However, let me confirm once again.

Wait, the problem says that radius OB is perpendicular to chord CD. In our setup, OB is the y-axis, CD is horizontal, so they are perpendicular. Correct. The length of CD is 24, which matches. X is the intersection point of OB and CD, which is (0,5). Then OX is the distance from O to X, which is 5. So the answer is A. 5.

But let me check if there's another possibility. What if point B is (0,-13)? Then line OB would be the negative y-axis. Then line CD is still horizontal at y=5. The intersection point X would be (0,5), same as before. Then OX is still 5. So regardless of direction of B, the distance remains 5.

But wait, the problem mentions that X lies on line OB and line CD. So even if B were on the lower side, X is still at (0,5). Thus, OX is 5. So answer A. However, let me check if there's another interpretation.

Wait, the problem says that X lies on line CD and line OB. But in our case, X is the midpoint of CD. Is there another possible position for X? Suppose that line CD is not horizontal. Wait, but we constructed coordinates based on the given information. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's wording.

Wait, the problem says "Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D". So OB is a radius, which is perpendicular to chord CD. Therefore, as per the theorem, the radius perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, the midpoint of CD lies on OB. Therefore, X is the midpoint of CD, which is on OB. Therefore, X is the midpoint. Hence, OX is the distance from the center to the chord, which is 5 inches. Therefore, answer A. 5.

But why is there an option C as 13? Maybe someone might think OX is equal to the radius, but no. Since X is inside the circle, OX is less than 13. So 5 is correct. Hence, answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ OX $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem. The key elements are:

- **Circle** $ O $ with radius $ r = 13 $ inches.
- Points $ C, D, B $ lie on the circle.
- Lines $ \text{Line}(O, B) $ and $ \text{Line}(C, D) $ intersect at point $ X $, satisfying:
  - $ X \in \text{Line}(O, B) $
  - $ X \in \text{Line}(C, D) $
- It is stated that **$ \overline{OB} \perp \overline{CD} $**, i.e., radius $ OB $ is perpendicular to chord $ CD $.
- Length of chord $ CD = 24 $ inches.

---

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. **Chord Geometry and Distance from Center**
We apply the **chord-perpendicular-radius theorem**:  
If a **radius** is **perpendicular** to a **chord**, it **bisects** the chord and intersects it at its **midpoint**.

Thus, the **intersection point** $ X $ lies on both:
- Line $ OB $ (since it’s a radius),
- Line $ CD $ (since it’s a chord),

and because $ OB \perp CD $, their intersection point $ X $ must be the **midpoint** of chord $ CD $.

#### 2. **Using the Chord Length Formula**
The relationship between the **length of a chord**, its **distance from the center**, and the **circle’s radius** is given by:

$$
\text{Length of chord } CD = 2\sqrt{r^2 - d^2}
$$

Where:
- $ r = 13 $,
- $ CD = 24 $

Substitute values:

$$
24 = 2\sqrt{13^2 - d^2} \\
12 = \sqrt{169 - d^2} \\
144 = 169 - d^2 \\
d^2 = 25 \Rightarrow d = 5
$$

This tells us that the **shortest distance from the center $ O $ to the chord $ CD $** is **5 inches**.

Since $ X $ is the **midpoint** of $ CD $ and lies on the **perpendicular radius $ OB $**, the segment $ OX $ is **equal to this shortest distance**.

---

### Final Calculation:

$$
OX = 5 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Conclusion:

The only correct answer matching this value among the choices is:

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
