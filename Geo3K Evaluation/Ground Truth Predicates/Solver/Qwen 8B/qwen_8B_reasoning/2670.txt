MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral ABCD which is a rectangle. And they tell us that angle 2 has measure 40 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 3. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each angle should be 90 degrees. Wait, but maybe there's more here because there are points E involved? The problem mentions several angles related to point E, which lies on lines DA and CB. Also, BD is perpendicular to BA. Hmm, okay, so first I need to visualize or sketch the diagram based on the given information.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. So, points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is adjacent to BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. Now, point E is on both line DA and line CB. Wait, DA is one side of the rectangle, and CB is another side? Wait, CB would be the same as AD since ABCD is a rectangle? No, wait, CB is connected to point C and B. Let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, then sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So DA is one side, CB is another. But since it's a rectangle, DA is parallel to CB, and AB is parallel to DC. But point E lies on both DA and CB. That suggests that E is the intersection point of DA and CB? But DA and CB are two sides of the rectangle. Wait, unless DA and CB are extended beyond their original segments. Because in a rectangle, DA and CB are opposite sides; they don't intersect unless extended. Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, A)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(C, B)). So E is on line DA (which could be the entire line, not just the segment) and also on line CB. Therefore, E is the intersection point of lines DA and CB. However, in a rectangle, DA and CB are parallel? Wait no. In a rectangle, DA is adjacent to AB. Let me get this straight. Let me assign coordinates to make it clearer.

Let me consider coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, suppose AB is horizontal. Then point B would be at (a,0) for some a. Then point C would be at (a,b), and point D at (0,b). So DA goes from D(0,b) to A(0,0), which is vertical line x=0. CB goes from C(a,b) to B(a,0), which is vertical line x=a. Wait, so lines DA and CB are both vertical lines. So their intersection would be... Well, if they're both vertical lines at x=0 and x=a, they only intersect if a=0, which can't be. So that suggests that my initial assumption about the positions might be wrong. Maybe I got the order of the rectangle wrong?

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me check again. The rectangle is ABCD. So the vertices are ordered such that AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. So if I imagine the rectangle, moving from A to B to C to D and back to A. So in standard position, if A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. So DA connects D to A, which would be the left side. CB connects C to B, which is the right side. These two lines DA and CB are both vertical lines (if AB is horizontal). Therefore, they are parallel and do not intersect unless extended infinitely. But the problem states that E lies on both DA and CB, meaning that E is the intersection point of these two lines. But since DA and CB are parallel, they never meet. This seems contradictory. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the lines DA and CB are not the sides but the entire lines. For example, line DA extends beyond points D and A, and line CB extends beyond points C and B. Therefore, their intersection point E is somewhere outside the rectangle. For instance, if DA is the line extending from D(0,b) through A(0,0) and beyond, and CB is the line extending from C(a,b) through B(a,0) and beyond. These two lines are parallel (both vertical), so they never meet. Wait, still no intersection. So that's impossible. There's something wrong here. Unless the rectangle is actually a different configuration.

Alternatively, maybe I misassigned the labels. Suppose ABCD is a rectangle, but the order is different. Like, maybe A is connected to B and D, and B is connected to A and C, etc. Wait, but regardless of the labeling, in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So DA is parallel to CB. Hence, lines DA and CB are parallel, thus cannot intersect unless they are the same line. Which would mean that DA and CB are the same line, which isn't possible unless the rectangle is degenerate. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption about the configuration must be incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says that point E lies on both line DA and line CB. So maybe the lines are not the sides but other lines? Or perhaps the rectangle is not convex? Or maybe I made a mistake in assuming the direction of the sides. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is rotated? Or perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement? Wait, no, the problem says that Perpendicular(Line(B, D), Line(B, A)). So BD is perpendicular to BA. Let me think about that.

If BD is perpendicular to BA, then BA is a horizontal line (assuming standard orientation), so BD would be vertical. So point D is such that BD is vertical. Let me try to reassign coordinates accordingly. Let me assume point B is at (0,0). Then BA is horizontal, so point A could be at (a, 0). Since BD is perpendicular to BA, BD is vertical. So point D must lie along the vertical line passing through B. Wait, BD is the line connecting B to D. If BD is vertical and BA is horizontal, then D is directly above or below B. Let me say D is at (0, d). Then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from B to C to D to A. Wait, if B is at (0,0), D is at (0,d). Then point C would be at (c, d) because BC is horizontal? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if BA is horizontal from B(0,0) to A(a,0), then BD is vertical upwards from B(0,0) to D(0,d). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, the fourth vertex C can be found by adding the vector from B to A to point D. Wait, vectors: BA is (a,0), BD is (0,d). So point C would be at A + BD vector? Or D + BA vector? Let me recall how rectangles work. From point B, moving along BA to A, then from A moving up to C, which should be parallel to BD. Wait, maybe I need to use coordinates properly.

Let me fix coordinates:

- Let’s set point B at (0, 0).

Since BA is horizontal, let’s say point A is at (a, 0). 

BD is perpendicular to BA, so BD is vertical. Thus, point D is along the y-axis from B. Let’s take D at (0, d).

Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, the vector from B to A is (a, 0), and the vector from B to D is (0, d). To find point C, in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of AC and BD should be the same. Alternatively, since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates can be determined by adding vectors.

From point A(a,0), moving in the same direction as BD to reach point C. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides AB and AD are adjacent sides. Wait, but BD is not a side. Wait, BD is a diagonal? Wait, no. Wait, BD connects points B and D. If ABCD is a rectangle, then BD is a diagonal. Wait, but earlier the problem said that BD is perpendicular to BA. So BD is a diagonal that is perpendicular to BA. Let me check that.

So, BA is from B(0,0) to A(a,0), direction vector (a,0). BD is from B(0,0) to D(0,d), direction vector (0,d). Their dot product is (a)(0) + (0)(d) = 0, hence they are perpendicular. Yes, that works. So BD is perpendicular to BA. Good.

Now, to find point C. In a rectangle, the coordinates of C can be found by adding the vector from B to A and the vector from B to D. Wait, no. Let me think. In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC.

Vector AB is (a,0). Vector AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,d): (-a, d). Wait, but in a rectangle, AD should be equal to BC. So vector BC should be equal to vector AD. Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(x,y). So BC = (x,y). It should equal AD, which is (-a, d). Therefore, x = -a and y = d. So point C is at (-a, d)? Wait, but then point C would be at (-a, d). Then, checking the rectangle:

Points:

A(a, 0)

B(0, 0)

C(-a, d)

D(0, d)

Wait, connecting them in order A-B-C-D-A?

Wait, from A(a,0) to B(0,0) to C(-a, d) to D(0, d) to A(a,0). Hmm, does this form a rectangle? Let me check the slopes.

AB: slope from A to B is (0-0)/(0-a) = 0/-a = 0, horizontal line.

BC: from B(0,0) to C(-a,d). Slope is (d-0)/(-a - 0) = -d/a.

CD: from C(-a,d) to D(0,d). Slope is (d-d)/(0 - (-a)) = 0/a = 0, horizontal line.

DA: from D(0,d) to A(a,0). Slope is (0 - d)/(a - 0) = -d/a.

So sides AB and CD are horizontal, BC and DA have slope -d/a. So it's a parallelogram. But for it to be a rectangle, all angles must be 90 degrees. However, the slopes of AB and BC are 0 and -d/a. The product of slopes of AB and BC is 0 * (-d/a) = 0 ≠ -1, so they aren't perpendicular. Hence, this is not a rectangle. Therefore, my assignment is wrong.

Hmm. What's wrong here? Maybe I messed up the coordinates. Let me think again.

If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB and AD are adjacent sides, meeting at A. Wait, but according to the previous setup, point D was chosen such that BD is perpendicular to BA. Wait, but BD is a diagonal, not a side. So maybe I need to adjust.

Alternative approach: Since BD is perpendicular to BA, and ABCD is a rectangle, then BD is a diagonal that is perpendicular to BA. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but here BD is perpendicular to BA, which is a side. So this implies that the rectangle is a square? Not necessarily. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. So if BD is perpendicular to BA, which is a side, then this condition imposes specific proportions.

Let me try again. Let me consider BA as horizontal, length l, and BD as vertical, length m. Since BD is perpendicular to BA, and ABCD is a rectangle. Let me define coordinates again.

Let me take point B at (0,0). Let me take BA along x-axis, so point A is at (l, 0). BD is perpendicular to BA, so BD is vertical. Let me take D at (0, m). Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, we need to find coordinates of C.

In a rectangle, the coordinates of C can be determined by adding vectors. From point B(0,0), moving along BA to A(l,0), and from point B(0,0), moving along BD to D(0,m). Then, point C should be at A + BD vector, which would be (l, 0) + (0, m) = (l, m). Wait, but then ABCD would be points A(l,0), B(0,0), C(0,m), D(l,m)? Wait, no. Wait, connecting A to B to C to D to A. Wait, if C is at (0, m), then from B(0,0) to C(0,m) is vertical, then from C(0,m) to D(l,m) is horizontal? Wait, but then D would be (l,m), but earlier we had D at (0,m). Conflict here. So confusion arises.

Maybe better to use vectors. In a rectangle, the sides AB and AD are perpendicular. Wait, but BD is supposed to be perpendicular to BA. So if BD is perpendicular to BA, which is a side, then BD is a diagonal. So in triangle ABD, BD is perpendicular to BA. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. So this suggests that the rectangle is a square? Because otherwise, the diagonals wouldn't be perpendicular to a side.

Wait, but in general, in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other but aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. So if BD is perpendicular to BA, then this implies that BA is perpendicular to BD. So BA is a side, BD is a diagonal. So in this case, BA is perpendicular to BD, which means that in triangle ABD, angle at B is 90 degrees. Wait, but in a rectangle, angle at B is already 90 degrees. So this suggests that triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at B. Which makes sense because in a rectangle, each corner is a right angle. So BD is the hypotenuse of triangle ABD. Wait, but BD is a diagonal, yes. So in triangle ABD, with right angle at B, then AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, then AB² + BD² = AD²? Wait, no. Wait, the hypotenuse is AD, because the right angle is at B. So AB and BD are legs, and AD is the hypotenuse. So AB² + BD² = AD². But in a rectangle, AD is one of the sides. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, which is equal to BC. While AB is another side. So if AB² + BD² = AD², then BD is sqrt(AD² - AB²). But BD is the diagonal of the rectangle? Wait, no. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and given by sqrt(AB² + AD²). But here, BD is a diagonal, so its length should be sqrt(AB² + AD²). But according to the previous equation, BD² = AD² - AB², which contradicts unless AB = 0. So something is wrong here.

This suggests that my assumption about the configuration is incorrect. Perhaps the label of the rectangle is different. Let me try another approach. Maybe the rectangle is labeled such that BD is a side, not a diagonal? Wait, but the problem says Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(B,A)), so BD is perpendicular to BA. If BD were a side, then BA and BD would be adjacent sides, meeting at B, making angle at B being 90 degrees, which is consistent with a rectangle. Wait! Oh! Wait, in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So if BA and BD are adjacent sides, then angle at B is between BA and BD, which would be 90 degrees. But in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees, so this is possible. So BD is a side, not a diagonal. Wait, but in that case, the rectangle would have sides BA and BD, and then the other sides would be AD and BC. Wait, but how does that fit together?

Let me clarify. If ABCD is a rectangle, then the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. If BD is a side, then it would imply that the rectangle has sides AB, BD, DC, and CA? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the rectangle is labeled such that BD is one of its sides. Wait, but in standard notation, ABCD is a quadrilateral with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So BD would be a diagonal, not a side. Therefore, there's inconsistency. So this suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem's description.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a non-standard rectangle, or there's additional elements like triangles within the rectangle. Given that point E is defined on both DA and CB, and various angles are mentioned involving E. Let me focus on the angles given. The problem gives several equalities between angles and certain angles labeled 1 through 8. We know angle 2 is 40 degrees, and need to find angle 3. 

Given that ABCD is a rectangle, so angles at A, B, C, D are all 90 degrees. But there are other angles formed by point E. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram with E being the intersection of DA and CB extended.

Earlier confusion arose because DA and CB are parallel, but if we extend them, they might meet at a point E. Wait, no—if DA and CB are parallel, they will never meet. Unless they are the same line. Wait, but in a rectangle, DA and CB are opposite sides, hence parallel. Therefore, they cannot intersect unless extended in some way? Wait, no. They are parallel, so they don't intersect. Hence, point E cannot exist unless the lines are not the sides but something else. Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, A)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(C, B)). So E is on both lines DA and CB. Which implies that lines DA and CB intersect at E. But in a rectangle, DA and CB are parallel, hence they don't intersect. Contradiction. So this suggests that either the problem has a typo, or my understanding is wrong. 

Wait, maybe the rectangle is not a typical rectangle, but a three-dimensional shape? Unlikely, as the problem refers to angles in a plane. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lines DA and CB are not the sides but other lines. Wait, the problem says "Line(D, A)" and "Line(C, B)", which are the infinite lines passing through D and A, and through C and B respectively. If DA and CB are not parallel, then they intersect at E. But in a rectangle, DA and CB are parallel. Wait, but maybe in this case, due to the perpendicularity condition, they are not parallel? Let me check.

Earlier, we had BD perpendicular to BA. Let me consider that. If BD is perpendicular to BA, and ABCD is a rectangle, then BA and BD are perpendicular. So BA is one side, BD is another side? Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if BA is a side, and BD is another side, then BD must be adjacent to BA at point B. So point D would be next to B? Wait, in a rectangle, each vertex has two adjacent sides. So if BA is one side, then the other side at B is BC or BD? Wait, in standard labeling, ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So at point B, the sides are AB and BC. So BD would be a diagonal, not a side. Hence, the earlier assumption that BD is perpendicular to BA would imply that BD is a diagonal, which is not a side. 

But in this case, if BD is a diagonal, then in a rectangle, the diagonal BD would have a certain slope. Let me try coordinates again. Let me assume rectangle ABCD with A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,b), D(0,b). Then BD is the diagonal from B(a,0) to D(0,b). The slope of BD is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. BA is from B(a,0) to A(0,0), slope is (0-0)/(0 - a) = 0, horizontal line. So BD has slope -b/a, BA is horizontal. For BD to be perpendicular to BA, their slopes' product should be -1. But slope of BA is 0, so product is 0 * (-b/a) = 0 ≠ -1. Hence, they are not perpendicular. So this contradicts the given condition that Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(B,A)). So this suggests that the rectangle is not in the standard position. 

Therefore, there must be a different configuration. Let me think again. Suppose the rectangle is such that BA is horizontal, and BD is vertical, making BD perpendicular to BA. So in this case, point D is vertically aligned with B. Let me define coordinates again:

Let me set point B at (0,0). BA is horizontal, so point A is at (a,0). BD is vertical, so point D is at (0,d). Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, we need to determine coordinates of C. 

In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So AB is from A(a,0) to B(0,0). AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,d). Wait, but in a rectangle, AB and AD should be adjacent sides, meeting at A. Wait, but if D is at (0,d), then AD goes from A(a,0) to D(0,d). So vector AD is (-a, d). Then, to complete the rectangle, point C should be such that vector BC equals vector AD. Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(x,y), which should be equal to vector AD (-a, d). Hence, x = -a, y = d. So point C is at (-a, d). 

Now, let's verify if ABCD is a rectangle. Points are:

A(a,0), B(0,0), C(-a,d), D(0,d). Connecting A-B-C-D-A.

Check the sides:

AB: from A(a,0) to B(0,0) → length √(a² + 0) = a.

BC: from B(0,0) to C(-a,d) → length √(a² + d²).

CD: from C(-a,d) to D(0,d) → length √((a)^2 + 0) = a.

DA: from D(0,d) to A(a,0) → length √(a² + d²).

So opposite sides are equal: AB = CD = a, BC = DA = √(a² + d²). Now, check angles. At point B(0,0), the sides are BA (from B to A: vector (a,0)) and BC (from B to C: vector (-a,d)). The angle at B is between BA and BC. Let's compute the dot product of vectors BA and BC. Vector BA is (a,0), vector BC is (-a,d). Dot product is (a)(-a) + (0)(d) = -a². For them to be perpendicular, the dot product should be zero. Here it's -a² ≠ 0, so they are not perpendicular. Hence, angle at B is not 90 degrees. Contradiction. So this configuration is invalid.

This suggests that having BD perpendicular to BA in a rectangle is impossible under normal conditions. Hence, there must be a different interpretation. Maybe the rectangle is not in the Euclidean plane? Or there's a typo in the problem? Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is folded or something? Or perhaps the lines DA and CB are not the sides but other lines?

Wait, going back to the original problem statement: "Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle." So it's definitely a rectangle. The issue is with the perpendicular condition. Let me think: maybe BD is not a diagonal but a side? If BD is a side, then in the rectangle, it would mean that the rectangle has sides AB, BD, DC, and CA? No, that would not form a rectangle. Alternatively, if the rectangle is labeled differently, like A, B, D, C? Let me try labeling the rectangle as A, B, D, C. So the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But then, for it to be a rectangle, all angles must be 9 0 degrees. So at point B, the sides are AB and BD, which are perpendicular. At point D, sides are BD and DC, which must be perpendicular. So this could work. Let me try coordinates again.

Let me set point B at (0,0). Since BD is perpendicular to BA, and BA is a side. Let me say BA is along x-axis from B(0,0) to A(a,0). BD is perpendicular to BA, so it goes upward from B(0,0) to D(0,d). Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, the next side after D should be DC. So from D(0,d), move in the direction opposite to BA to reach C. Since in a rectangle, DC is equal and parallel to AB. AB is from A(a,0) to B(0,0), which is vector (-a,0). So DC should also be vector (-a,0). Starting from D(0,d), add vector (-a,0) to get C: (0 - a, d + 0) = (-a, d). Then, from C(-a,d), the next side is CA, which should be equal and parallel to BD. BD is from B(0,0) to D(0,d), vector (0,d). So CA should be vector (0,d). From point C(-a,d), adding vector (0,d) gives A(-a, d + d) = (-a, 2d). But point A is supposed to be at (a,0). This is inconsistent. Hence, this configuration is invalid.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to abandon coordinate geometry and think about the angles given.

The problem gives several equalities between angles involving point E. Specifically:

- Angle at E, B, D (∠EBD) equals angle 6.

- Angle at E, A, B (∠EAB) equals angle 2 (given as 40°).

- Angle at C, E, D (∠CED) equals angle 8.

- Angle at A, D, C (∠ADC) equals angle 3 (what we need to find).

- Angle at C, A, D (∠CAD) equals angle 1.

- Angle at D, C, E (∠DCE) equals angle 7.

- Angle at D, E, B (∠DEB) equals angle 5.

- Angle at B, D, E (∠BDE) equals angle 4.

Also, point E lies on lines DA and CB, and BD is perpendicular to BA.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles at A, B, C, D are 90°. Let me try to mark these angles.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, angles at A, B, C, D are right angles. Let me focus on point E, which is the intersection of lines DA and CB. Wait, but in a rectangle, DA and CB are parallel, so they don't intersect unless extended. Assuming they are extended, let me consider E as the intersection of the extensions of DA and CB.

Let me imagine extending DA beyond A and CB beyond B, until they meet at E. Or extending DA beyond D and CB beyond C? Depending on the rectangle's dimensions.

Assuming E is the intersection of DA extended and CB extended. Let me try to visualize this. Let me consider DA extended beyond A, and CB extended beyond B. These lines would meet at some point E outside the rectangle.

With BD perpendicular to BA, and ABCD being a rectangle. Let me try to use this.

Since BD is perpendicular to BA, and BA is a side of the rectangle, BD is a line starting at B and perpendicular to BA. In a rectangle, BA is one side, and BD would be a diagonal if D is the opposite corner, but earlier attempts showed inconsistencies. Alternatively, if BD is a height from B to DA? Wait, in a rectangle, DA is a side, and BD could be a line from B to D, where D is a vertex. But in a rectangle, DA is adjacent to D, so BD would be a diagonal.

But given that BD is perpendicular to BA, which is a side, this implies that in triangle ABD, angle at B is 90°, making ABD a right triangle. So in this case, AB and BD are perpendicular, and AD is the hypotenuse.

But in a rectangle, AD is a side, so if AB and BD are perpendicular, then AD = sqrt(AB² + BD²). But in a rectangle, AD is a side, and AB is another side, so this would mean that AD is longer than AB, depending on BD's length. This is possible.

Let me try to assign variables. Let AB = a, BD = b, so AD = sqrt(a² + b²). But in a rectangle, AD should be equal to BC, and AB equal to CD. But I'm not sure how this helps yet.

Now, focusing on point E, which is on lines DA and CB. Let me assume that E is the intersection of DA extended and CB extended. Let me consider triangle EBD and other triangles.

Given that angle EAB = angle 2 = 40°. So at point A, angle between EA and AB is 40°. Since EA is part of line DA extended, and AB is a side of the rectangle. Let me think about triangle EAB. In this triangle, we know angle at A is 40°, and we might be able to relate other angles.

Also, since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. So if we extend DA and CB to meet at E, then EA is parallel to CB? Wait, no. DA and CB are parallel, so their extensions would form a transversal. Wait, if DA and CB are parallel, and E is their intersection, that would require them to be coincident, which they aren't. So this suggests that my assumption about E's location is wrong.

Wait, perhaps E is the intersection of DA and CB when extended in the other direction? For example, extending DA beyond D and CB beyond C. Let me try that. So DA extended beyond D, and CB extended beyond C meet at E. Let me consider this scenario.

In this case, E is outside the rectangle, forming triangle EDC and others. Let me try to analyze the angles.

Given that angle EAB = 40°, which is angle at A between EA and AB. If E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then EA is going from E through D to A. So angle EAB is formed at A between EA (which is DA extended) and AB. Since DA is a side of the rectangle, and AB is another side, the angle between DA and AB is 90°, as it's a rectangle. But if E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then EA is in the opposite direction of DA. So the angle between EA (which is opposite to DA) and AB would be supplementary to the angle between DA and AB. Since DA and AB are perpendicular, the angle between EA and AB would be 90° + angle between EA and DA. Wait, this is getting complex. Let me draw it mentally.

At point A, DA goes from D to A, and AB goes from A to B. If we extend DA beyond A to E, then EA is a continuation of DA past A. So the angle between EA and AB at A would be the same as the angle between DA and AB, which is 90°, but since EA is opposite to DA, it would form a straight line. Wait, no. If you extend DA beyond A, then at point A, the line DA continues to E, and AB is another line. The angle between EA (which is DA extended) and AB is the same as the angle between DA and AB, which is 90°, because DA and AB are perpendicular. But the problem says that this angle is equal to angle 2, which is 40°. This suggests a contradiction, unless my assumption about E's location is wrong.

This indicates that E cannot be on the extension of DA beyond A. Similarly, if E is on the extension of DA beyond D, then at point A, the line DA goes from D to A, and E is on the other side of D. So EA passes through D and goes to E. At point A, the angle between EA and AB would involve the line from A to D (DA) and AB. Since DA and AB are perpendicular, the angle between DA and AB is 90°, but if E is on DA extended beyond D, then EA is the same as DA. Hence, the angle between EA and AB at A is still 90°, which conflicts with angle 2 being 40°. Hence, this suggests that E is not on the extension of DA beyond D or A, but somewhere else.

Wait, maybe E is inside the rectangle? But DA and CB are sides of the rectangle, so their intersection would be at the overlap, but since they are parallel, they don't intersect inside. Hence, this is impossible. 

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps I should focus on the given angle relationships instead of trying to locate E.

We know that angle EAB = angle 2 = 40°. Let me consider triangle EAB. In this triangle, angle at A is 40°, and if I can find other angles or sides, maybe I can relate them.

Also, since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to AD. So angle BAD is 90°. If E is somewhere such that angle EAB is 40°, then the line AE forms a 40° angle with AB. Let me imagine this: at point A, AB is one side, and AE is another line making 40° with AB. Since AB is horizontal (say), then AE would be at 40° above or below AB. If E is inside the rectangle, but DA is perpendicular to AB, so DA is vertical. If AE is at 40° from AB, then it would intersect DA at some point E. Wait, this could be possible!

Let me try this: Assume AB is horizontal, DA is vertical. At point A, AB is horizontal, DA is vertical. If we draw a line AE making 40° with AB (which is horizontal), then this line AE would intersect DA at point E. Wait, but DA is already at point A. Wait, if AE is drawn from A at 40° above AB, it would go upwards from A, possibly intersecting DA? No, because DA is vertical from A upwards. So if AE is at 40° from AB (horizontal), then it would go upwards and to the right (if angle is measured clockwise) or left (counterclockwise). But DA is vertical upwards from A. So if AE is at 40° from AB (horizontal), it would form a 40° angle with AB, and intersect DA at some point E. Wait, but DA is vertical, so if AE is at 40°, it would intersect DA at some point E above A. 

Yes! So point E is above A on the extension of DA. Wait, but DA is from D to A. If E is above A on DA extended, then it's on line DA. So this satisfies PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, A)). 

Similarly, point E is also on line CB. So line CB is from C to B. If E is above A on DA extended, then line CB must pass through E. Let me see if this is possible.

Let me try to assign coordinates again. Let me set A at (0,0), B at (a,0), since AB is horizontal. DA is vertical from A(0,0) to D(0, b). So D is at (0, b). Now, point E is on DA extended above A, so E is at (0, k) where k < 0 (since above A would be negative if A is at (0,0) and DA goes up to D(0,b)). Wait, no: if DA is from D(0,b) to A(0,0), then extending DA beyond A would go to (0, -m) for m > 0. So E is at (0, -m). 

Now, line CB: point C is at (a, b) because in a rectangle, from B(a,0) to C(a,b). So line CB is vertical line from C(a,b) to B(a,0). So line CB is x = a. For point E(0, -m) to lie on line CB (x=a), it would need to satisfy x=0 = a, which implies a=0, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

Thus, this suggests that E cannot be on both DA and CB unless a=0, which is not allowed. Hence, this configuration is invalid. 

This is very confusing. Maybe there's a property or theorem I'm missing. Let me look at the given angle relationships. The problem provides multiple equalities between angles involving E. Let me list them:

1. ∠EBD = angle 6
2. ∠EAB = angle 2 = 40°
3. ∠CED = angle 8
4. ∠ADC = angle 3 (to find)
5. ∠CAD = angle 1
6. ∠DCE = angle 7
7. ∠DEB = angle 5
8. ∠BDE = angle 4

Also, BD ⊥ BA.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, ∠BAD = 90°, ∠ABC = 90°, etc. Let me focus on triangle ABE. In this triangle, we know ∠EAB = 40°, and since AB is perpendicular to AD, and E is on DA, then AE is a line from A making 40° with AB. Let me assume that E is on DA extended beyond A, so that AE is part of DA extended. Wait, but DA is from D to A, so extending beyond A would be in the direction away from D. So if I consider E on DA extended beyond A, then line AE is part of DA. But then angle EAB is between AE (which is DA extended) and AB. Since DA is perpendicular to AB, the angle between DA and AB is 90°, so angle EAB would be 90°, but it's given as 40°. Contradiction again.

Unless E is not on DA extended, but on some other line. Wait, but the constraint says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, A)), so E must be on DA. Hence, this suggests that E is on DA, which is a side of the rectangle. But DA is from D to A, so E could be anywhere on DA, including between D and A, or extended. If E is between D and A, then line EB would connect E to B. Let me consider this possibility.

Let me assume E is on DA between D and A. Then, ∠EAB is the angle at A between EA and AB. Since EA is part of DA, which is perpendicular to AB. So ∠EAB is the angle between DA (which is perpendicular to AB) and AB, which is 90°, but it's given as 40°. Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that my understanding is fundamentally flawed. Perhaps the problem involves a different type of quadrilateral, but it's stated as a rectangle. Or perhaps the angles mentioned are not internal angles of the rectangle but other angles formed by intersections?

Wait, let me think about the angles given. The problem mentions ∠EAB, which is at point A, between E and B. If E is on DA, then this angle is between EA (part of DA) and AB. As before, this would be 90° if E is on DA, but it's given as 40°. Hence, this suggests that E is not on DA itself, but on the extension of DA beyond A, and the angle is measured in a different way. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not at A, but at E? No, the notation ∠EAB means the angle at A, between points E, A, B. So it's at A. 

Given this impasse, maybe I should consider that the rectangle is actually a square, and use trigonometry. Let me assume that AB = BD, making the rectangle a square, and see if that helps. But even then, the earlier contradictions persist.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that since BD is perpendicular to BA, and ABCD is a rectangle, then triangle ABD is a right triangle, and using that, we can find relations between the sides, and then use the angles given to find angle 3.

Let me try this. Let me denote AB = a, BD = b, and AD = c. In triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so a² + b² = c². But in a rectangle, AD is equal to BC, and AB is equal to CD. But without knowing specific lengths, it's hard to proceed.

Now, considering point E on DA and CB. Let me assume E is on DA extended and CB extended. Let me use similar triangles or some angle chasing.

Given ∠EAB = 40°, and AB is perpendicular to DA. So if I consider triangle EAB, with ∠EAB = 40°, and AB ⊥ DA, then maybe I can find other angles.

Let me denote ∠EAB = 40°, and since AB ⊥ DA, then ∠BAD = 90°. So if I extend DA beyond A to E, then ∠EAB is the angle between EA (which is DA extended) and AB, which is 90°, but it's given as 40°. This is a contradiction unless my assumptions are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between EA and AB, but between EA and some other line? No, the notation ∠EAB means at A, between E, A, B. So it's between EA and AB.

At this point, I think I need to switch strategies. Let me consider that despite the earlier contradictions, the problem assumes that such a configuration exists, and focus on the given angle relationships.

Given that ∠EAB = 40°, and ABCD is a rectangle, let's try to express other angles in terms of this.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Let me consider the lines and angles around point E.

Since E is on DA and CB, and BD is perpendicular to BA, let me consider triangle EBD. In this triangle, we know that ∠EBD is equal to angle 6. Also, ∠EAB = 40°, which is part of triangle EAB.

Perhaps using the fact that ABCD is a rectangle, we can find relationships between angles.

Let me try to find angle 3, which is ∠ADC. In the rectangle, ∠ADC is a right angle, 90°. But the problem says ∠ADC = angle 3. If this is true, then angle 3 would be 90°, but option D is 90°, but let me check if this is the case.

Wait, but the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). Angle ADC is the angle at D, between A, D, C. In a rectangle, this angle is 90°, so angle 3 would be 90°. But the answer choices include D as 90°, but the given angle 2 is 40°, which might suggest that angle 3 is not 90°. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong, and ∠ADC is not a right angle. But why?

Wait, the problem says that Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). Angle ADC is the angle at D, between A, D, C. In a rectangle, this is indeed a right angle, so angle 3 would be 90°. But if the answer is D, then that's possible. But the presence of other angles like angle 2 = 40° suggests that there might be more complexity. However, the problem might be designed such that angle 3 is 90°, but let me verify.

Wait, but the problem includes other angles like angle 1, 2, ..., 8, which might be related to the triangles formed by point E. Maybe angle 3 is not the angle of the rectangle but another angle? Wait, the notation Angle(A, D, C) is the angle at D, between A, D, C. In the rectangle, this is the angle at D, which is 90°. So angle 3 is 90°. Hence, the answer would be D. But let me check if this is consistent with the given angle 2 = 40°.

However, the problem may not be as straightforward. Let me think again: if angle 2 is 40°, and angle 3 is 90°, then the answer would be D. But the problem might involve other relationships where angle 3 is not 90°, suggesting that my assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for a different angle. Let me double-check the notation. The problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). So angle ADC is at D, between A, D, C. In the rectangle, this is 90°, so angle 3 is 90°, which would be option D. But the presence of angle 2 = 40° might indicate that there's more to it, but maybe not. 

However, given that the problem includes other angles related to point E, it's possible that angle 3 is not the angle of the rectangle but another angle. Wait, but the notation specifies Angle(A, D, C), which is unambiguously the angle at D. Hence, it should be 90°. 

But why is angle 2 given as 40°? Maybe it's a red herring, or there's a miscalculation. Let me think: if angle 3 is 90°, then the answer is D. But let me check if there's a reason for angle 2 to be 40°. 

If angle 2 is ∠EAB = 40°, and in the rectangle, this angle is formed by line EA and AB. If EA is a line from E on DA to A, and AB is a side, then this angle being 40° suggests that EA is not aligned with DA, but this contradicts E being on DA. Hence, this suggests that my previous conclusion is wrong, and angle 3 is not 90°, implying that there's a different interpretation.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess. Since angle 2 is 40°, and in the context of a rectangle with other angles, maybe angle 3 is 50°, as supplementary to 40°, making the answer C. Or it could be 90°, making D. But without proper analysis, it's risky. However, since angle 2 is at a different location, and angle 3 is at D, which is a right angle, I'll go with D. But I'm uncertain.

Wait, another thought: if E is such that ∠EAB = 40°, and BD is perpendicular to BA, then maybe triangle ABE has some relationship. Let me consider triangle ABE, where ∠EAB = 40°, and AB is perpendicular to BD. If I can find some relation between these angles.

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's difficult. Given that I'm stuck, and the most logical conclusion from the rectangle's angle is 90°, I'll choose D.
