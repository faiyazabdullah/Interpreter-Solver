A. 53

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a plane traveling from Des Moines to Phoenix, then to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines. The total trip is 3482 miles, and we need to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta. 

First, I need to visualize the path. Let me imagine a triangle where the points are Des Moines (let's call it point A), Phoenix (point B), and Atlanta (point C). Wait, but the problem says the plane goes from Des Moines to Phoenix (so A to B), then to Atlanta (B to C?), wait no—wait, the path is Des Moines to Phoenix (A to B), then to Atlanta (so Phoenix to Atlanta would be B to C?), and then back to Des Moines (C back to A). So the path forms a triangle ABC, with the plane going A→B→C→A. Therefore, the total distance is AB + BC + CA = 3482 miles. But we need to find BC, which is the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta. 

But looking at the given constraints, there are equations involving LengthOf(Line(A,C)) which would be AC, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) which is AB, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) which is BC. So the three sides of the triangle are AB, BC, and AC. And their lengths are given as expressions in terms of x. 

Wait, the problem gives:

LengthOf(Line(A, C)) = 73.8x  
LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = 150x + 91  
LengthOf(Line(B, C)) = 110x + 53  

So, the total trip is AB + BC + CA = (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + 73.8x = total distance 3482 miles. 

Therefore, combining these terms:

Let me compute the coefficients for x and constants separately. 

For the x terms: 150x + 110x + 73.8x. Adding those together: 150 + 110 is 260, plus 73.8 is 333.8x. Then the constant terms: 91 + 53 = 144. 

So total distance equation: 333.8x + 144 = 3482. 

Now, solving for x: subtract 144 from both sides: 333.8x = 3482 - 144. Let me calculate that. 

3482 minus 144: Let's do 3482 - 100 = 3382, then subtract 44 more: 3382 - 44 = 3338. So 333.8x = 3338. 

Then x equals 3338 divided by 333.8. Let me compute that division. 

Hmm, 333.8 times 10 is 3338. So 333.8 * 10 = 3338. Therefore, x = 10. 

Wait, so x is 10? That seems straightforward. 

Then, the question asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is BC, which is given as 110x + 53. Plugging x=10 into that expression: 110*10 + 53 = 1100 + 53 = 1153 miles. 

Wait, but none of the answer choices is 1153. The options are A. 53, B. 73.8, C. 110, D. 1591. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

The problem states that the total trip was 3482 miles. So AB + BC + CA = 3482. 

AB is 150x + 91, BC is 110x + 53, CA is 73.8x. 

Adding them up: 150x + 91 + 110x +53 +73.8x = (150 + 110 +73.8)x + (91 +53) = 333.8x + 144 = 3482. 

Yes, same as before. Solving 333.8x = 3482 -144 = 3338. So x = 3338 / 333.8. Which is indeed 10. Because 333.8 multiplied by 10 is 3338. So x=10. 

Then BC is 110x +53. If x=10, that's 110*10 +53 = 1100 +53 = 1153. 

But 1153 isn't among the choices. The closest option is D. 1591. Wait, that's way higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the path is not a triangle? Like, maybe the plane goes from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and back to Des Moines, meaning that the return trip is from Atlanta to Des Moines, which would be the same as CA. So the total trip is AB + BC + CA. So that's still the same as before. 

Alternatively, could the problem involve some other configuration? For example, maybe the path is a straight line? No, because it's going from A to B to C and back to A, forming a triangle. 

Wait, unless the problem has different labels. Let me check again the original problem statement. 

"A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines..." So the path is Des Moines → Phoenix → Atlanta → Des Moines. Therefore, the distances are AB (Des Moines to Phoenix), BC (Phoenix to Atlanta), and CA (Atlanta to Des Moines). So total distance AB + BC + CA. 

Thus, my calculation should be correct. However, since 1153 isn't an option, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me recheck the math. 

Total distance equation: 333.8x + 144 = 3482. Subtracting 144: 3482 - 144. Let me verify that subtraction again. 

Breaking down 3482 - 144: 3482 - 100 = 3382; 3382 - 44 = 3338. Yes, correct. 

Then 333.8x = 3338. Dividing both sides by 333.8 gives x = 3338 / 333.8. Let me compute that division again. 

Since 333.8 × 10 = 3338, yes, x = 10. 

So BC = 110x +53 = 110×10 +53 = 1100 +53 = 1153. 

But the answer choices don't include 1153. The options are A. 53, B. 73.8, C. 110, D. 1591. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for something else? For instance, perhaps the answer is supposed to be AC instead of BC? Let me check. 

If the question is asking for Phoenix to Atlanta, which is BC. But maybe there's confusion between AC and BC? Let me check the original problem statement again. 

The problem says: "Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta". Since Phoenix is B and Atlanta is C, then Phoenix to Atlanta is BC. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different labels. For example, maybe the points are labeled differently. Suppose that the path is A (Des Moines) → B (Phoenix) → C (Atlanta) → A. Then the distances are AB, BC, and CA. So BC is Phoenix to Atlanta. 

So that part seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about a triangle? Like, perhaps the path is not a closed triangle? But the problem says the plane returns to Des Moines, so it must form a triangle. 

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let me think again. 

Suppose that the total trip is from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and back to Des Moines. So the total distance is AB + BC + CA. Which is the perimeter of triangle ABC. 

So according to the given equations, AB = 150x +91, BC = 110x +53, CA = 73.8x. 

So adding them: 150x +91 + 110x +53 +73.8x = 333.8x +144 = 3482. 

Which leads us to x=10. 

So BC is 110*10 +53 = 1153. 

But since 1153 is not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps I made a wrong assumption. 

Wait, let me check if the problem may have meant that the trip is from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and back to Des Moines, making it two legs: Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta, then back to Des Moines. But that would be AB + BC + CA, which is the same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe the return trip is directly from Atlanta to Des Moines, which is CA. So same thing. 

Another possibility: Perhaps the problem is not referring to the entire perimeter but only certain segments. For example, maybe the total trip includes going from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and then back to Des Moines, which is AB + BC + CA, but maybe the problem considers that the return trip is from Atlanta to Des Moines, which is CA, but maybe the problem counts only AB + BC, thinking that the return is not included? Wait, but the problem says "total trip was 3482 miles", so it should include all parts. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors or something else, but no, it's just distances. 

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo in the answer choices? Or maybe I need to consider that the given expressions are not the actual lengths but something else? 

Wait, the problem says "Given geometric constraints" with the three length equalities. But maybe they aren't the sides of a triangle? For example, maybe they are in a different configuration? 

But without more information, like angles or something else, we can't assume that. The only thing given is the lengths of the lines between the points. So assuming that the three points form a triangle, the sum of the three sides is the total trip. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not a triangle? For example, maybe the flight path is not a triangle but a different polygon? But with three cities, it's a triangle. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is using different units? For example, the total trip is in miles, but the expressions are in some other unit? But no, the answer choices are in miles. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating BC. Let me recalculate BC when x=10. 

BC is 110x +53. x=10, so 110*10 is 1100, plus 53 is 1153. Correct. 

Looking at the answer choices again: A. 53, B. 73.8, C. 110, D. 1591. None of these match 1153. 

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me check again. 

Total distance: 150x +91 + 110x +53 +73.8x = ?

Combine x terms: 150x +110x = 260x, plus 73.8x is 333.8x. Constants: 91 +53 = 144. So total distance is 333.8x +144 = 3482. 

Solving for x: 333.8x = 3482 -144 = 3338. 

Divide both sides by 333.8: x = 3338 / 333.8. 

Let me compute this division numerically. Let me convert 333.8 into decimal. It's 333.8, which is the same as 3338/10. So dividing 3338 by 333.8 is equivalent to multiplying numerator and denominator by 10: 33380 / 3338 = 10. Exactly. So x=10. 

So BC = 110x +53 = 110*10 +53 = 1153. 

Hmm. So either there's a mistake in the problem's answer choices, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not asking for BC but for AC? Let me check. The question says: "distance from Phoenix to Atlanta". Phoenix is B, Atlanta is C. So BC. 

But maybe the answer choices have a typo, and the correct answer is 1153, which is not listed. But since the options are given, maybe I need to reconsider. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the three points are colinear? Like, the plane flies in a straight line from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta, but that wouldn't make sense because you can't go from Phoenix to Atlanta along a straight line if it's already on the same line as Des Moines. Unless it's a straight line, but then the distance would be AB + BC = AC. But then the total trip would be AB + BC + CA, which would be AB + BC + AB = 2AB + BC. But that would require knowing the specific arrangement. 

Wait, if the points are colinear, then depending on the order. For example, if the points are in order A-B-C, then the total trip would be AB + BC + CA. But CA would be AB + BC if they're colinear. Wait, no. If A---B---C, then CA is the distance from C to A, which is AB + BC. So total trip would be AB + BC + (AB + BC) = 2AB + 2BC. But that would give a different equation. 

However, the problem didn't mention anything about collinearity, so assuming a triangle is safer. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about a triangle but about a different shape. But with three points and returning to the start, it's most likely a triangle. 

Wait, unless the flight path is A to B to C to A, but with some overlapping paths? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the answer is one of the constants in the expressions. For example, if x=10, then 53 is a constant term in BC. But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the Law of Cosines or something else, but with only the lengths given, we can't apply that unless we know angles. 

Wait, but the problem provides three lengths expressed in terms of x. So, if we assume that the triangle satisfies the triangle inequality, but that might not help here. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem's setup, such that the total trip is not AB + BC + CA but AB + BC. For example, if the plane goes from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and then stops there, but the problem says "back to Des Moines," so it should return. 

Wait, maybe the total trip is AB + BC, and then the return trip is not included? But that contradicts the wording. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the plane flew from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta, and then returned directly to Des Moines, making it AB + BC + CA. Which brings us back to the same calculation. 

At this point, since the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the choices, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I missed something. 

Wait, looking back at the answer choices, option D is 1591. Let me see what value would lead to that. Suppose BC is 1591, then 110x +53 = 1591. Solve for x: 110x = 1591 -53 = 1538. x=1538 / 110 ≈ 13.98... approximately 14. 

If x≈14, then let's check total distance: 333.8x +144 = 333.8*14 +144. Let me compute 333.8*14: 

Well, 333.8 * 10 = 3338, 333.8 * 4 = 1335.2, total is 3338 + 1335.2 = 4673.2, plus 144 is 4673.2 + 144 = 4817.2, which is nowhere near 3482. So that's not matching. 

Option C is 110. If BC = 110, then 110x +53 = 110 => 110x = 57 => x = 57/110 ≈ 0.518. Then total distance would be 333.8*(0.518) +144 ≈ 333.8*0.5 is 166.9, plus 333.8*0.018 ≈ 6.01, total ≈ 172.9 + 144 = 316.9, which is much less than 3482. 

Option B is 73.8, which is the coefficient for CA. If CA = 73.8x, and if x=10, then CA is 738 miles. But the answer is asking for BC, which would be 1153. 

Option A is 53, which is the constant term in BC. 

None of these seem to fit. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not about finding BC, but another segment? Let me check the problem statement again. 

"Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta." Phoenix is B, Atlanta is C. So BC. 

Wait, maybe the problem refers to the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta as AC? That would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the labels are switched. Suppose that the points are A (Des Moines), B (Atlanta), C (Phoenix)? No, the problem says the plane goes from Des Moines to Phoenix (A to B), then to Atlanta (B to C?), so Phoenix is B, Atlanta is C. 

Wait, maybe the problem had a typo and the given equations are different. Let me double-check the original problem's constraints. 

Original constraints:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), 73.8x)  
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), 150x+91)  
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 110x+53)  

So, AC = 73.8x, AB = 150x +91, BC = 110x +53. 

Total trip: AB + BC + CA = (150x +91) + (110x +53) +73.8x = 333.8x +144 = 3482. 

So x=10, leading to BC=1153. 

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem intended to ask for AC, which is 73.8x = 73.8*10 = 738 miles. But 738 isn't an option either. The closest option is B. 73.8, but that's 73.8 miles, which is not 738. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different multiplier. For example, if the total trip was 3482 miles, and if x=10, then the individual distances are: 

AB = 150*10 +91 = 1500 +91 = 1591 miles. 

Ah! Option D is 1591. So maybe the question asked for AB instead of BC? Let me check the problem again. 

The question says: "Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta". If Phoenix is B and Atlanta is C, then BC is 1153. But if there's a mistake and the problem actually wants AB, which is 1591, then D would be correct. 

Perhaps the original problem had a mix-up in labeling the points. For example, if the plane went from Des Moines (A) to Phoenix (C) to Atlanta (B), then back to Des Moines (A), then the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta would be CB, which is BC. But if the labels were swapped, maybe. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total trip is not AB + BC + CA but AB + BC. In that case, total trip would be AB + BC = 150x +91 +110x +53 = 260x +144 = 3482. Then solving 260x = 3482 -144 = 3338 => x=3338 / 260 ≈ 12.838. Then BC would be 110x +53 ≈ 110*12.838 +53 ≈ 1412.18 +53 ≈ 1465.18, still not matching options. 

Alternatively, if the total trip was AB + CA = 150x +91 +73.8x = 223.8x +91 = 3482. Then 223.8x = 3482 -91 = 3391 => x ≈ 3391 / 223.8 ≈ 15.15. Then BC = 110x +53 ≈ 1666.5 +53 ≈ 1719.5, still no. 

Alternatively, if the total trip was AB + BC = 3482, then as above. 

Alternatively, maybe the total trip is AB + BC - CA? But that would be nonsensical. 

Wait, if the problem says the plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix to Atlanta and back to Des Moines, but the return trip is direct from Atlanta to Des Moines, which is CA. So total trip is AB + BC + CA. Which is what I did earlier. 

Unless there's a miscalculation in the arithmetic. Let me check once more: 

Total distance = 333.8x +144 = 3482  
=> 333.8x = 3482 -144 = 3338  
=> x = 3338 / 333.8 = 10. 

Yes. 

So BC = 110*10 +53 = 1153. 

Since this is not an option, and considering the answer choices, the closest is D. 1591, which is AB = 150x +91 when x=10: 150*10 +91 = 1500 +91 = 1591. 

So perhaps the problem had a mistake in the question, and it should be asking for AB instead of BC. Given that, the answer would be D. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the labels are assigned. For example, if the points are A (Phoenix), B (Des Moines), C (Atlanta), then the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta would be AC. Let me check: 

If the plane goes from Des Moines (B) to Phoenix (A) to Atlanta (C), then back to Des Moines (B). So total trip is BA + AC + CB. 

BA is the same as AB = 150x +91. AC is 73.8x. CB is BC = 110x +53. Total is same as before. Still, the distance from Phoenix (A) to Atlanta (C) is AC = 73.8x = 738, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if the problem had mixed up the labels, and the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is CA, which is 73.8x = 738, but again not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the value of x? But that's not an option. 

Given that, and since the closest answer to BC=1153 is none, but AB=1591 is option D, and given that sometimes problems have typos, I think the intended answer is D. 

Therefore, even though the calculation suggests BC=1153, which isn't listed, the closest possible option based on the given choices is D. 1591, which corresponds to AB. This might indicate a mislabeling in the problem. Hence, choosing D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, we begin by interpreting the described route as forming a triangle $ \triangle ABC $, where:

- **Point A** represents Des Moines,
- **Point B** represents Phoenix,
- **Point C** represents Atlanta.

The total journey consists of the following segments:
- From **A to B**: $ AB = 150x + 91 $
- From **B to C**: $ BC = 110x + 53 $
- From **C to A**: $ CA = 73.8x $

The total trip distance is therefore the sum of the lengths of these three sides:

$$
AB + BC + CA = (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + 73.8x
$$

### Step 1: Combine like terms
Group the terms by variable ($ x $) and constants:

- Coefficients of $ x $: $ 150 + 110 + 73.8 = 333.8 $
- Constant terms: $ 91 + 53 = 144 $

This gives the equation:

$$
333.8x + 144 = 3482
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 144 from both sides:

$$
333.8x = 3482 - 144 = 3338
$$

Now divide both sides by 333.8:

$$
x = \frac{3338}{333.8} = 10
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta

We are asked to find the distance from **Phoenix to Atlanta**, which corresponds to side $ BC $. Using the formula for $ BC $:

$$
BC = 110x + 53
$$

Substitute $ x = 10 $:

$$
BC = 110(10) + 53 = 1100 + 53 = 1153
$$

---

### Step 4: Match Result to Answer Choices

The computed value $ BC = 1153 $ does **not** match any of the answer choices. However, upon closer inspection of the given options, we observe that:

- $ AB = 150x + 91 = 150(10) + 91 = 1591 $, which **does** match **option D**.

Given that the problem specifically asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, and our calculation yields a non-matching result while the value of $ AB $ matches **option D**, it appears there may be a mislabeling or typographical error in the problem setup. Assuming the intention was to ask for the length of segment $ AB $, the correct answer would be:

---

**Final Answer: D**
