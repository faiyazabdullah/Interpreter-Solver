MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle PQR, and points S and T such that ST is parallel to QR. The given lengths are PS = 12.5, SR = 5, and PT = 15. We need to find TQ. The answer choices are A through D. 

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the problem. Let me imagine triangle PQR. Points S and T are somewhere on the sides of the triangle. Since ST is parallel to QR, maybe they're using similar triangles here? Because when lines are parallel, similar triangles often come into play.

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnLine(T, Line(P, Q)) and PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(P, R)). Hmm, so point T lies on line PQ, and point S lies on line PR. Wait, but then ST is parallel to QR. So, connecting points S (on PR) and T (on PQ), making ST || QR. That seems like it would create similar triangles. Let me confirm:

If ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PST might be similar to triangle PQR? Or maybe another pair of triangles?

Let me think again. Since ST || QR, then by the converse of Thales' theorem (or basic proportionality theorem), the line ST divides the sides PQ and PR proportionally. Wait, but S is on PR and T is on PQ. So according to the Basic Proportionality Theorem, if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. 

So, applying that here, since ST || QR, then the ratio of PS to SR should equal the ratio of PT to TQ? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact statement. 

The theorem says that if a line parallel to one side intersects the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally. So in this case, line ST is parallel to QR, which is the base of the triangle. But the line ST intersects PQ at T and PR at S. Therefore, the ratio of PT to TQ equals the ratio of PS to SR? Wait, not sure. Let me write down variables.

Let me denote the segments. On PQ, we have point T. So PQ is divided into PT and TQ. Similarly, PR is divided into PS and SR. Given that ST || QR, then the ratio PT / TQ = PS / SR. Is that right?

Wait, actually, the theorem states that PT / TP = PS / SR? No, more accurately, if a line cuts two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. Conversely, if a line is parallel to the third side, then it divides the other two sides proportionally. 

So in this case, ST is parallel to QR, so the ratio of the segments on PQ and PR should be equal. So PT / TQ = PS / SR. Wait, but how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle PQR with ST || QR. Then, triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR? Wait, if ST is parallel to QR, then angle PST equals angle PQR, and angle PSR equals angle PRQ? Wait, maybe not directly. Maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR? Let me check angles.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle PST is congruent to angle PQR because they are corresponding angles. Also, angle at P is common. Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR by AA similarity. Yes! So that's the key. 

Therefore, the ratio of similarity between triangle PST and PQR is PS / PQ. Wait, but we don't know PQ yet. Alternatively, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. So PS corresponds to PQ, PT corresponds to PR, and ST corresponds to QR. Wait, maybe I need to set up proportions correctly.

Wait, in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So if triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, then PS / PQ = PT / PR = ST / QR. However, we don't know PR or QR. But perhaps there's another way. Let me think about the ratios.

But maybe instead of that, since ST is parallel to QR, the ratio of PS to PR should be equal to PT to PQ. Wait, that's the same as before. Let me recall the formula.

From the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales'), if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally. So, for example, if ST || QR, then PS / PR = PT / PQ. 

But we can also note that PS + SR = PR. Given that SR = 5 and PS = 12.5, so PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5. 

Similarly, PT is given as 15, and we need to find TQ. Since PQ is split into PT and TQ, so PQ = PT + TQ = 15 + TQ. 

According to the theorem, PS / PR = PT / PQ. Plugging in numbers:

PS = 12.5, PR = 17.5, PT = 15, PQ = 15 + TQ. 

So:

12.5 / 17.5 = 15 / (15 + TQ)

Cross-multiplying:

12.5 * (15 + TQ) = 17.5 * 15

Compute both sides:

Left side: 12.5*(15 + TQ)
Right side: 17.5*15 = 262.5

So solving for TQ:

Divide both sides by 12.5:

15 + TQ = 262.5 / 12.5

Calculate 262.5 ÷ 12.5. Well, 12.5 * 20 = 250, so 262.5 - 250 = 12.5, which is 12.5/12.5 = 1. So total is 20 + 1 = 21. Therefore,

15 + TQ = 21 => TQ = 21 -15 = 6.

So TQ is 6. Which is option B. 

Wait, but let me verify once more. Because sometimes I mix up the ratios. Let me check the setup again.

The Basic Proportionality Theorem says that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then the segments are proportional. In this case, ST is parallel to QR, cutting sides PQ and PR. Therefore, the ratio of PS to SR (the parts of PR) should be equal to the ratio of PT to TQ (the parts of PQ). Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was PS / PR = PT / PQ, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me clarify.

The theorem states that the ratio of the segments on the two sides is equal. So, if ST is parallel to QR, then PS / SR = PT / TQ. Wait, that's different than before. Which is correct?

Let me think again. Suppose ST is parallel to QR. So, in triangle PQR, line ST cuts PQ at T and PR at S. Then, according to the theorem, PS / SR = PT / TQ. Wait, but why?

Because the line ST divides PR into PS and SR, and PQ into PT and TQ. The theorem says that these ratios are equal. So, PS / SR = PT / TQ. 

Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Which one is correct?

Let me take an example. Suppose in triangle ABC, DE is parallel to BC, with D on AB and E on AC. Then AD / DB = AE / EC. So the ratio of the segments on AB over the segments on AC. So in general, the ratio of the segments on each side is equal. So, in our problem, the line ST is cutting PQ and PR. So, the ratio along PQ is PT / TQ, and the ratio along PR is PS / SR. Therefore, PT / TQ = PS / SR. 

Ah, so my initial thought was wrong. It's PT / TQ = PS / SR. Therefore, PT / TQ = PS / SR. 

Wait, so in this case, PT = 15, PS = 12.5, SR = 5. So substituting:

PT / TQ = PS / SR → 15 / TQ = 12.5 / 5 → 15 / TQ = 2.5. Therefore, TQ = 15 / 2.5 = 6. So TQ = 6. Which matches the previous answer. So either approach works, depending on how you set up the ratios. 

So regardless of whether I use the similar triangles or the Basic Proportionality Theorem, I arrive at TQ = 6. Therefore, the answer is B. 

Wait, just to make sure, let me re-express the equations properly. 

Using the Basic Proportionality Theorem:

PS / SR = PT / TQ

Plugging in values:

PS = 12.5, SR = 5, PT = 15, TQ = ?

So:

12.5 / 5 = 15 / TQ

Which simplifies to 2.5 = 15 / TQ → TQ = 15 / 2.5 = 6. Correct. 

Alternatively, using similar triangles. As mentioned before, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR. 

Wait, if ST || QR, then triangle PST ~ triangle PQR. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is PS / PR. 

PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5. 

So the ratio is PS / PR = 12.5 / 17.5 = 5/7. 

Then, in similar triangles, the ratio of PT / PQ = 5/7. 

We know PT = 15, so:

15 / PQ = 5/7 → PQ = 15 * 7 / 5 = 21. 

Thus, PQ = 21. Since PQ = PT + TQ = 15 + TQ, then TQ = 21 - 15 = 6. Same answer. 

So both methods give TQ = 6, which is option B. 

I think that's solid. So the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and leveraging the **Basic Proportionality Theorem** (also known as Thales’ Theorem), which applies when a line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides. This theorem tells us that the line divides the sides of the triangle proportionally.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup

- Triangle $ \triangle PQR $
- Points $ S $ and $ T $ lie on sides $ PR $ and $ PQ $ respectively.
- Segment $ ST \parallel QR $
- Given lengths:
  - $ PS = 12.5 $
  - $ SR = 5 $
  - $ PT = 15 $
- Need to find: $ TQ $

---

### Step 2: Apply the Basic Proportionality Theorem

Since $ ST \parallel QR $, the segment $ ST $ intersects sides $ PR $ and $ PQ $. According to the theorem:

$$
\frac{PS}{SR} = \frac{PT}{TQ}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
\frac{12.5}{5} = \frac{15}{TQ}
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:

$$
\frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5
$$

Now equate:

$$
2.5 = \frac{15}{TQ}
$$

Solve for $ TQ $:

$$
TQ = \frac{15}{2.5} = 6
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify Using Similar Triangles (Optional Confirmation)

Triangles $ \triangle PST $ and $ \triangle PQR $ are similar due to the parallel lines $ ST \parallel QR $, giving us:

$$
\frac{PS}{PR} = \frac{PT}{PQ}
$$

Given:
- $ PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5 $
- $ PT = 15 $

So:

$$
\frac{12.5}{17.5} = \frac{15}{PQ}
$$

Solving for $ PQ $:

$$
PQ = \frac{15 \times 17.5}{12.5} = 21
$$

Since $ PQ = PT + TQ = 15 + TQ $, we get:

$$
TQ = 21 - 15 = 6
$$

This confirms the result.

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
