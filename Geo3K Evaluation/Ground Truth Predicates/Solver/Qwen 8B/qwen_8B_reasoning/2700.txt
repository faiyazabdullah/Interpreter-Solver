MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have some constraints here. Let me parse them one by one.

First, the problem says that the length of line CD is 15 units, and the length of line AB is also 15 units. Then there's an angle at point C between points D, C, B which measures 30 degrees. Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular, and lines DB and DC are perpendicular. The question is asking for the area of the figure formed by these constraints. The answer choices are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let me note down all the given information:

- Length CD = 15
- Length AB = 15
- Angle DCB = 30°
- AB ⊥ AC (so AB is perpendicular to AC)
- DB ⊥ DC (so DB is perpendicular to DC)

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to the points to make this easier? Coordinates might help because dealing with lengths and angles could be simplified using coordinate geometry.

Let me start by placing point C somewhere. Let's assume point C is at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Now, since AB is perpendicular to AC, and DB is perpendicular to DC. Let me think about how to place the points.

But first, let's consider the angle at point C: angle DCB is 30 degrees. So, points D, C, B form an angle of 30 degrees at C. Also, DC has length 15, as given. And CB... Wait, do we know the length of CB? Not directly. But perhaps we can find relations between the sides.

Also, AB is 15 units long. Let me see. Since AB is perpendicular to AC, triangle ABC is a right triangle at A. Wait, no—if AB is perpendicular to AC, then the right angle is at A. Because AB and AC meet at A, so if they're perpendicular, then angle at A is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at A.

Similarly, DB is perpendicular to DC. So, lines DB and DC are perpendicular. That means that at point D, the lines DC and DB meet at a right angle. So, triangle DBC is right-angled at D?

Wait, but angle at C is given as 30 degrees. So, in triangle DCB, angle at C is 30 degrees, and angle at D is 90 degrees (since DB is perpendicular to DC). Therefore, triangle DCB is a right triangle at D, with angle at C being 30 degrees. Therefore, we can use trigonometry to find the sides.

In triangle DCB, right-angled at D, angle at C is 30°, hypotenuse is BC. Wait, wait—let me clarify. In triangle DCB, side DC is adjacent to the 30° angle at C. Wait, DC is one leg, DB is another leg, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, no. If angle at C is 30°, and the right angle is at D, then the sides opposite the angles are:

Opposite angle C (30°): DB.

Adjacent to angle C: DC.

Hypotenuse is BC.

So, tan(angle C) = opposite / adjacent = DB / DC.

Given that angle C is 30°, DC is 15, so tan(30°) = DB / 15 => DB = 15 * tan(30°).

Since tan(30°) is 1/√3 ≈ 0.577, so DB ≈ 15*(0.577) ≈ 8.66 units.

Then, BC can be found via Pythagoras: BC² = DC² + DB² = 15² + (15/√3)^2.

Calculating that:

15² = 225.

(15/√3)^2 = 225 / 3 = 75.

Therefore, BC² = 225 + 75 = 300 → BC = √300 = 10√3 ≈ 17.32 units.

Now, moving on. We also have AB = 15. AB is perpendicular to AC. Let me consider triangle ABC. It's right-angled at A. So, AB and AC are legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but earlier we found BC is 10√3. However, AB is given as 15. Let me check if that holds.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A, AB = 15, AC is unknown, and BC is 10√3.

By Pythagoras:

AB² + AC² = BC² → 15² + AC² = (10√3)^2 → 225 + AC² = 100*3 = 300 → AC² = 75 → AC = √75 = 5√3 ≈ 8.66 units.

Hmm, interesting. So AC is 5√3. Wait, but earlier we had DB = 15/√3 = 5√3 as well. So DB equals AC? Interesting.

Is there a relationship between these two segments? Let me think. Since AB is perpendicular to AC, and DB is perpendicular to DC. Is there a possibility that points A and D are related somehow? Maybe not directly yet.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more structure here. Let me try to reconstruct coordinates for each point.

Starting with point C at (0, 0). Let me define coordinates for other points based on this.

Since AC is a leg of the right triangle ABC, right-angled at A. Let me suppose that point A is somewhere such that AC is along the x-axis or y-axis. Wait, but AB is perpendicular to AC. Let me set up coordinates accordingly.

Let me fix coordinate system:

Let’s take point C at (0, 0). Since AB is perpendicular to AC, and assuming AC lies along the x-axis. Let me say that AC is horizontal. So, point A is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Point C: (0, 0)

Let’s suppose point A is at (a, 0), since AC is along x-axis. Then AB is perpendicular to AC, meaning AB is vertical. So AB is vertical, going upwards from A. Therefore, point B would be at (a, b) for some b, since AB is vertical. The length AB is 15, so distance from A(a, 0) to B(a, b) is |b - 0| = |b|. Therefore, AB = 15 implies b = ±15. Let's take positive direction for simplicity: b=15. So point B is at (a, 15).

Now, we also have triangle DCB with DC = 15, angle at C is 30°, and DB perpendicular to DC.

Earlier, we found that in triangle DCB, DC is 15, angle at C is 30°, right angle at D. So, coordinates of D?

Since DC is connected to point C (0,0). Let me determine coordinates of D. Since DC is a line from C(0,0) to D, and angle at C is 30°, and DB is perpendicular to DC.

Let me parametrize DC. Suppose DC makes an angle θ with the x-axis. Wait, but angle between DC and CB is 30°, but since triangle DCB is right-angled at D, perhaps we can find coordinates.

Alternatively, since we know DC = 15, and angle at C is 30°, and right angle at D. Let me think.

If we consider triangle DCB, right-angled at D, then coordinates of D can be determined relative to C and B.

But maybe I need to relate points D and B. Alternatively, since DB is perpendicular to DC, vector DC · vector DB = 0.

Let me attempt coordinates again. Let me assume DC is along some direction. Since angle between DC and CB is 30°, but maybe it's complex. Alternatively, since we already have coordinates for B as (a, 15), and point C is (0,0), maybe I can express coordinates of D.

Let me think. Vector DC goes from D to C. Wait, no, DC is from D to C? Or from C to D? Wait, the angle at C is between D-C-B. So, vectors CD and CB. So, angle between CD and CB is 30°, and since triangle DCB is right-angled at D, so CD is perpendicular to DB.

So, if I can find coordinates of D such that CD is 15, and DB is perpendicular to CD.

Let me consider point D. Let me assume coordinates for D as (x, y). Since CD has length 15, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 15.

Also, vector CD is from C to D: (x, y). Vector DB is from D to B: (a - x, 15 - y). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

CD ⋅ DB = x(a - x) + y(15 - y) = 0.

Additionally, the angle between CD and CB is 30 degrees. Vector CB is from C to B: (a, 15). The angle between CD (vector (x,y)) and CB (vector (a,15)) is 30 degrees.

The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is cosθ = (u ⋅ v)/(|u||v|).

So,

cos(30°) = [ (x*a + y*15) ] / ( |CD| * |CB| )

We know |CD| = 15, and |CB| is sqrt(a² + 15²). Earlier, in triangle ABC, BC was found as 10√3 when AB was 15 and AC was 5√3. Wait, but here, in this coordinate setup, BC is sqrt(a² + 15²). But earlier calculation said BC was 10√3. So equate those?

Wait, yes! Earlier, in triangle ABC, we found BC = 10√3. But BC here is sqrt(a² + 15²). Therefore:

sqrt(a² + 15²) = 10√3 → square both sides: a² + 225 = 100 * 3 = 300 → a² = 75 → a = sqrt(75) = 5√3 ≈ 8.66. Which matches our previous conclusion that AC = 5√3. So point A is at (5√3, 0), since AC is from (0,0) to (5√3, 0). Wait, no. Wait, earlier assumption was that point A is at (a, 0), so AC is from C(0,0) to A(a, 0), hence AC length is |a|. So since AC = 5√3, then a = 5√3. Therefore, coordinates:

Point A: (5√3, 0)

Point B: (5√3, 15) since AB is vertical from A(5√3, 0) up to B(5√3, 15)

Point C: (0, 0)

Now, back to point D. Let me write equations for D.

Vector CD is (x, y), with x² + y² = 15² = 225.

Vector DB is (5√3 - x, 15 - y). Their dot product is zero:

x*(5√3 - x) + y*(15 - y) = 0 → 5√3 x - x² + 15y - y² = 0.

Also, the angle between CD and CB is 30°, where vector CB is from C to B: (5√3, 15). So, compute the dot product of CD and CB:

CD ⋅ CB = x*(5√3) + y*15.

And |CD| = 15, |CB| = sqrt( (5√3)^2 + 15^2 ) = sqrt(75 + 225) = sqrt(300) = 10√3, which matches earlier.

Thus:

cos(30°) = [5√3 x + 15 y]/(15 * 10√3) → simplifying denominator: 15*10√3 = 150√3.

Numerator: 5√3 x + 15 y.

So:

[5√3 x + 15 y] / (150√3) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2.

Multiply both sides by 150√3:

5√3 x + 15 y = (√3 / 2) * 150√3 = (150 * 3)/2 = 225.

So:

5√3 x + 15 y = 225 → divide both sides by 5:

√3 x + 3 y = 45. Equation (1).

Also, from the perpendicularity condition:

From earlier equation:

5√3 x - x² + 15y - y² = 0 → rearranged:

-x² - y² + 5√3 x + 15y = 0 → but we can substitute from equation (1):

From equation (1): √3 x + 3y = 45 → multiply by √3: 3x + 3√3 y = 45√3.

Wait, maybe not helpful. Let me think.

Alternatively, since we have x² + y² = 225 (from |CD|=15), so substituting into the equation:

Original equation after expanding the dot product: 5√3 x + 15y - (x² + y²) = 0 → because -x² - y² + ... 

So:

5√3 x + 15y - (x² + y²) = 0 → but x² + y² = 225. Therefore:

5√3 x + 15y - 225 = 0 → which gives:

5√3 x + 15y = 225 → same as equation (1). So this equation is redundant. Thus, we only have equation (1): √3 x + 3y = 45, and x² + y² = 225.

So solving these two equations.

Let me write equation (1): √3 x + 3y = 45 → Let me solve for one variable. For example, solve for y:

3y = 45 - √3 x → y = 15 - (√3 / 3)x.

Substitute this into x² + y² = 225:

x² + [15 - (√3 / 3)x]^2 = 225.

Expand the second term:

[15 - (√3 / 3)x]^2 = 15² - 2 * 15 * (√3 / 3)x + ( (√3 / 3)x )² = 225 - 10√3 x + (3/9)x² = 225 - 10√3 x + (1/3)x².

Therefore, entire equation becomes:

x² + 225 - 10√3 x + (1/3)x² = 225.

Combine like terms:

x² + (1/3)x² = (4/3)x².

So:

(4/3)x² - 10√3 x + 225 = 225.

Subtract 225 from both sides:

(4/3)x² - 10√3 x = 0 → factor out x:

x [ (4/3)x - 10√3 ] = 0.

Thus, solutions are x = 0, or (4/3)x - 10√3 = 0 → x = (10√3 * 3)/4 = (30√3)/4 = (15√3)/2 ≈ 12.99.

But x=0 would imply point D is at (0, y). Let's check if that works. If x=0, then from equation (1): √3 * 0 + 3y = 45 → y = 15. So point D would be (0, 15). But then DC is from C(0,0) to D(0,15), which is vertical line. Then DB is from D(0,15) to B(5√3,15), which is horizontal line. So vector DB is (5√3, 0), and vector DC is (0,15). Are they perpendicular? Dot product is 0*5√3 + 15*0 = 0. Yes, they are perpendicular. So that's valid. However, angle at C between DC and CB: DC is vertical upward, CB is from C(0,0) to B(5√3,15). The angle between DC (vertical) and CB. Let's calculate that angle.

Vector DC is (0,15), vector CB is (5√3,15). The angle between them can be computed via:

cos(theta) = (DC ⋅ CB)/( |DC| |CB| ) = (0*5√3 + 15*15)/(15 * 10√3 ) = (225)/(150√3) = 3/(2√3) = √3/2. Therefore theta = 30°, which matches the given constraint. So this solution is valid. Therefore, point D is (0,15). But then, in this case, the figure includes points A(5√3, 0), B(5√3,15), C(0,0), D(0,15). Connecting these points, what shape is formed?

But wait, the problem mentions "the figure"—probably referring to quadrilateral ABCD? Or some combination of triangles? Let me check.

But given the constraints, perhaps the figure is made up of triangles ABC and ADC, or something else. Wait, but we need to find the area of the figure. Let me think.

But in this case, with D at (0,15), the figure could be quadrilateral ABCD. Let me plot the points:

A(5√3, 0), B(5√3, 15), C(0,0), D(0,15). Connecting these points in order? Or maybe different connections. But depending on how the figure is structured.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is composed of multiple shapes whose areas we can sum.

But maybe there's another solution for x. The other solution was x = (15√3)/2 ≈ 12.99. Let's check that.

If x = (15√3)/2, then plug into equation for y:

y = 15 - (√3 / 3)x = 15 - (√3 / 3)*(15√3 / 2) = 15 - ( (15 * 3) / (3 * 2 )) = 15 - (15 / 2) = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5.

So point D would be ((15√3)/2, 7.5). Let me verify if this satisfies x² + y² = 225.

Calculate x²: [(15√3)/2]^2 = (225 * 3)/4 = 675/4 = 168.75

y²: (7.5)^2 = 56.25

Total x² + y² = 168.75 + 56.25 = 225. Correct. So this is another valid solution.

But which one is correct? How do we decide between the two possibilities?

Well, since the problem didn't specify orientation, but likely expects a unique answer. However, both positions of D seem possible. However, considering the context, maybe only one makes sense with the rest of the figure.

Wait, but in the case where D is (0,15), then BD is horizontal from (0,15) to (5√3,15), which is length 5√3, which is equal to AC. Also, DC is vertical length 15, as given.

In the other case, D is ((15√3)/2, 7.5). Then BD would be from D((15√3)/2, 7.5) to B(5√3, 15). Let me compute the coordinates difference:

Δx = 5√3 - (15√3)/2 = (10√3 - 15√3)/2 = (-5√3)/2

Δy = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5

So vector DB is (-5√3/2, 7.5). Check if this is perpendicular to DC, which is from C(0,0) to D((15√3)/2, 7.5). So vector DC is ((15√3)/2, 7.5). Dot product with DB:

[(15√3)/2]*(-5√3/2) + 7.5*7.5

Compute first term: (15√3)(-5√3)/4 = (-75 * 3)/4 = -225/4 = -56.25

Second term: 7.5*7.5 = 56.25

Sum: -56.25 + 56.25 = 0. Perfect, so perpendicular. So both positions of D satisfy the conditions.

So which one is the correct one? Depending on the position of D, the figure may vary. However, since the problem asks for the area of the figure, maybe both configurations give the same area? Or maybe not. Let me check.

Case 1: D is at (0,15). Then the figure could be quadrilateral ABCD, with points A(5√3,0), B(5√3,15), C(0,0), D(0,15). This forms a trapezoid? Let me see:

Points A(5√3,0), B(5√3,15), C(0,0), D(0,15). Connecting A to B to C to D to A? Or some other order? Alternatively, maybe it's two triangles: ABC and ADC?

Area of ABC: Right triangle with legs AB=15 and AC=5√3. Area = (15 * 5√3)/2 = (75√3)/2 ≈ 64.95.

Area of ADC: Triangle with base DC=15 and height? If D is at (0,15), then AC is horizontal from (0,0) to (5√3,0), and D is at (0,15). So triangle ADC has vertices at A(5√3,0), D(0,15), C(0,0). This is a triangle with base AC = 5√3, and height from D to AC. Wait, but AC is horizontal. The y-coordinate of D is 15, but since AC is along x-axis from (0,0) to (5√3, 0). The height from D to AC would be vertical distance from D(0,15) to line AC (which is y=0), so height is 15. Therefore area of ADC is (base * height)/2 = (5√3 * 15)/2 = (75√3)/2, same as area of ABC. Total area would be twice that, giving 75√3 ≈ 129.9. Which is option C.

But wait, let me check Case 2 where D is at ((15√3)/2, 7.5). What's the area in this case?

Let me think. The figure might consist of triangle DCB and triangle ABC, but overlapping? Or maybe a quadrilateral?

Alternatively, the figure could be the union of triangles ABC and ABD? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the entire figure is a polygon combining ABC and ADC? Or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the total area is the area of ABC plus area of DBC?

In case where D is at (0,15), area of DBC: triangle DBC has base DC=15, height=DB=8.66 (as previously calculated). Wait, earlier we had in triangle DCB, which was right-angled at D, with DC=15, angle at C=30°, so DB=15 tan(30)=5√3≈8.66. Then area of triangle DBC is (DC * DB)/2 = (15 * 5√3)/2 = same as before, 75√3 / 2. Adding to area of ABC (same value) gives total area 75√3, which is approximately 129.9, matching option C.

But in the other case, with D at ((15√3)/2, 7.5), what is the area?

Let me calculate area of triangle DBC. In this case, triangle DBC is still right-angled at D. So area is (DC * DB)/2. DC is still 15, DB is length from D to B. Let me compute DB.

Coordinates of D: ((15√3)/2, 7.5), coordinates of B: (5√3, 15). So Δx = 5√3 - (15√3)/2 = (10√3 - 15√3)/2 = (-5√3)/2. Δy = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5. So length DB is sqrt( [(-5√3 / 2)^2 + (7.5)^2 ]) = sqrt( (75/4) + 56.25 ). Compute:

Convert 75/4 to decimal: 18.75; 56.25 added gives 75. So sqrt(75) = 5√3. So DB = 5√3, same as before. Hence area of triangle DBC is (15 * 5√3)/2 = 75√3 / 2, same as before. Then adding area of ABC, which is also 75√3 / 2, gives total area 75√3 ≈ 129.9, same as before. So regardless of position of D, the total area is same. Therefore, answer is C.

But let me confirm once again. If the figure refers to the union of ABC and DBC, then yes, total area would be 75√3. Let me compute 75√3 numerically. √3 ≈ 1.732. So 75 * 1.732 ≈ 75 * 1.732 ≈ 129.9. Which is option C. So the answer should be C.

But let me check if there's another interpretation. Perhaps the figure is a quadrilateral ABCD? Let me check the coordinates.

For case 1: Points A(5√3,0), B(5√3,15), C(0,0), D(0,15). Connecting A-B-C-D-A? Let's see:

This would create a quadrilateral with vertices at (5√3,0), (5√3,15), (0,0), (0,15). This is a rectangle? No, because the sides are not necessarily parallel. Wait, connecting A to B to C to D to A. From A(5√3,0) to B(5√3,15): vertical line. Then B to C: from (5√3,15) to (0,0): diagonal. Then C to D: from (0,0) to (0,15): vertical. Then D to A: from (0,15) to (5√3,0): diagonal. This creates a kite-shaped figure? Or a non-convex quadrilateral? Anyway, calculating its area.

Alternatively, split into two triangles: ABC and ADC. As done before, total area 75√3. Same as before.

Alternatively, if the figure is considered as the union of ABC and DBC, which is the same thing.

Another way: Using coordinates, the area can be calculated via shoelace formula for quadrilateral ABCD.

Take points in order A(5√3, 0), B(5√3,15), C(0,0), D(0,15), back to A(5√3,0).

Shoelace formula:

List the coordinates:

(5√3, 0), (5√3,15), (0,0), (0,15), (5√3,0)

Compute sum of products downwards:

Term1: 5√3 * 15 = 75√3

Term2: 5√3 * 0 = 0

Term3: 0 * 0 = 0

Term4: 0 * 15 = 0

Term5: 5√3 * 0 = 0

Sum of Term1-Term5: 75√3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 75√3

Sum of products upwards:

Term1: 0 * 5√3 = 0

Term2: 15 * 0 = 0

Term3: 0 * 0 = 0

Term4: 15 * 5√3 = 75√3

Term5: 0 * 5√3 = 0

Sum of Term1-Term5: 0 + 0 + 0 + 75√3 + 0 = 75√3

Area = |sum_down - sum_up| / 2 = |75√3 - 75√3| / 2 = 0. Wait, that can’t be right. Did I apply the shoelace formula correctly?

Wait, no. Shoelace formula requires multiplying x_i * y_{i+1} and subtracting y_i * x_{i+1}.

Let me redo the shoelace formula properly.

Order of points:

A(5√3, 0), B(5√3, 15), C(0, 0), D(0, 15), back to A(5√3, 0).

Compute sum of x_i * y_{i+1}:

First pair: x_A * y_B = 5√3 * 15 = 75√3

Second pair: x_B * y_C = 5√3 * 0 = 0

Third pair: x_C * y_D = 0 * 15 = 0

Fourth pair: x_D * y_A = 0 * 0 = 0

Sum of these: 75√3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 75√3

Now compute sum of y_i * x_{i+1}:

First pair: y_A * x_B = 0 * 5√3 = 0

Second pair: y_B * x_C = 15 * 0 = 0

Third pair: y_C * x_D = 0 * 0 = 0

Fourth pair: y_D * x_A = 15 * 5√3 = 75√3

Sum of these: 0 + 0 + 0 + 75√3 = 75√3

Then area is |75√3 - 75√3| / 2 = 0. Which suggests that the shoelace formula gives zero, implying that the points are colinear or the order is incorrect. Probably because the points are ordered incorrectly, leading to overlapping or crossing lines.

Ah, that’s because the order of the points isn't correct for the shoelace formula. The correct order should be either clockwise or counter-clockwise without crossing.

Let me try ordering the points properly. Let's go around the quadrilateral in order A, B, C, D, but need to ensure the polygon is simple (non-intersecting). Let me visualize:

Point A is at (5√3, 0), B at (5√3,15), C at (0,0), D at (0,15). Connecting A-B-C-D-A would cross over itself. Instead, perhaps the correct order is A, B, D, C, A?

Let me try that:

Order: A(5√3,0), B(5√3,15), D(0,15), C(0,0), back to A.

Compute shoelace:

x_i * y_{i+1}:

A to B: 5√3 * 15 = 75√3

B to D: 5√3 * 15 = 75√3

D to C: 0 * 0 = 0

C to A: 0 * 0 = 0

Sum: 75√3 + 75√3 + 0 + 0 = 150√3

y_i * x_{i+1}:

A to B: 0 * 5√3 = 0

B to D: 15 * 0 = 0

D to C: 15 * 0 = 0

C to A: 0 * 5√3 = 0

Sum: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Area = |150√3 - 0| / 2 = 75√3, which matches our previous calculation. So the area is indeed 75√3 ≈ 129.9. So answer is C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, 129.9.

I should check if there are any other interpretations. For instance, could the figure refer to just triangle ABC and triangle DBC, totaling 75√3? Or maybe another configuration? But given the constraints, it seems the area is uniquely determined as 75√3, which rounds to approximately 129.9, corresponding to option C.

Other answer choices:

A. 75 – too small.

B. 112.5 – less than 129.9.

C. 129.9 – matches.

D. 225 – double of 112.5, which is larger than our result.

Thus, the answer is C.

To determine the **area of the figure** defined by the given geometric constraints, we proceed systematically using coordinate geometry and properties of right triangles and trigonometric relationships.

---

### Step 1: Assign Coordinates Based on Constraints

We are given:

- $ \text{Length}(CD) = 15 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 15 $
- $ \angle DCB = 30^\circ $
- $ AB \perp AC $
- $ DB \perp DC $

We place point $ C $ at the origin:  
$$
C = (0, 0)
$$

Assume point $ A $ lies on the x-axis:  
$$
A = (a, 0)
$$

Since $ AB \perp AC $, and $ AB $ is vertical, point $ B $ lies directly above $ A $:  
$$
B = (a, 15)
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine Coordinates of Point $ D $

We are told that $ DC = 15 $ and $ \angle DCB = 30^\circ $. Additionally, $ DB \perp DC $, which tells us triangle $ DCB $ is a **right triangle**, right-angled at $ D $, and $ \angle C = 30^\circ $.

Using basic trigonometry in triangle $ DCB $:

- $ DC = 15 $
- $ \angle C = 30^\circ $
- Right triangle at $ D $ ⇒ $ \tan(\angle C) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{DB}{DC} $

So,
$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{DB}{15} \Rightarrow DB = 15 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 5\sqrt{3}
$$

We also compute the hypotenuse $ BC $ using Pythagoras:
$$
BC = \sqrt{DC^2 + DB^2} = \sqrt{15^2 + (5\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{225 + 75} = \sqrt{300} = 10\sqrt{3}
$$

So, the triangle $ ABC $, right-angled at $ A $, has:

- $ AB = 15 $
- $ AC = \sqrt{(BC)^2 - (AB)^2} = \sqrt{300 - 225} = \sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3} $

Thus, $ a = 5\sqrt{3} $, so:
$$
A = (5\sqrt{3}, 0), \quad B = (5\sqrt{3}, 15), \quad C = (0, 0)
$$

Now, we find point $ D $ such that:

- $ DC = 15 $
- $ DB \perp DC $
- $ \angle DCB = 30^\circ $

We deduce that point $ D $ lies vertically above point $ C $, i.e., on the y-axis, satisfying $ DC = 15 $. So:
$$
D = (0, 15)
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Figure

We now compute the **total area** of the figure formed by the four points: $ A, B, C, D $.

This figure consists of two congruent right triangles:

- $ \triangle ABC $: right triangle with legs $ AB = 15 $ and $ AC = 5\sqrt{3} $
- $ \triangle DBC $: right triangle with legs $ DC = 15 $ and $ DB = 5\sqrt{3} $

Each triangle has area:
$$
\text{Area}_{ABC} = \text{Area}_{DBC} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 15 \cdot 5\sqrt{3} = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

So, the **total area** is:
$$
\text{Total Area} = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2} = 75\sqrt{3}
$$

Approximating $ \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 $, we get:
$$
\text{Total Area} \approx 75 \times 1.732 = 129.9
$$
