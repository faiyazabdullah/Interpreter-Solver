====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several angle measures given and some points lying on lines. The goal is to find the measure of angle 3, which is denoted as ∠CGB (since it's Angle(C, G, B)). Also, there's a note that AB is perpendicular to BC. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given constraints.

First, let me list out all the given information:

1. ∠EBC = ∠6
2. ∠AGF = 104°
3. ∠EFC = 40°
4. ∠BFD = ∠4
5. ∠BAD = ∠2
6. ∠ADG = 36°
7. ∠CFB = ∠7
8. ∠BCD = ∠8
9. ∠CGB = ∠3
10. ∠GBF = ∠5
11. ∠DGA = ∠1
12. Point G lies on line BA.
13. Point F lies on line BE and CD.
14. Point G lies on line CD.
15. Point F lies on line CG.
16. Point G lies on line FD.
17. Lines BC and BG are perpendicular (AB ⊥ BC).

Wait, the last point says AB is perpendicular to BC. Wait, but the original constraint was Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,G)), so that means BC is perpendicular to BG. But since AB is also mentioned here? Wait, maybe I need to check again. Oh, the user wrote: "Given that AB ⊥ BC". Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement: the question says "if AB ⊥ BC", so perhaps that's part of the problem? Wait, the problem says "Find the measure of ∠3 if AB ⊥ BC." So AB is perpendicular to BC. Wait, but earlier there's a constraint that Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,G)), meaning BC is perpendicular to BG. So AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is perpendicular to BG. Therefore, AB and BG are parallel? Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, but AB and BG would be in different directions. Let me think.

Let me sketch mentally. Points B, C, and G. Since BC is perpendicular to BG, then BG is a line starting at B, going perpendicularly away from BC. Also, AB is perpendicular to BC. So AB is another line starting at B, also perpendicular to BC. Therefore, AB and BG are both perpendicular to BC, which would mean that AB is parallel to BG. But AB and BG share the common point B, so they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Wait, but that can't be. Unless AB and BG are colinear? That would make sense if AB is along BG. Wait, but the problem states that G lies on line BA. Wait, according to the given constraints: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B,A)). So point G is on line BA. Therefore, BG is part of BA. Wait, but if AB is perpendicular to BC, and BG is part of BA, then BG is also perpendicular to BC. So BC is perpendicular to BA, which is the same as saying AB is perpendicular to BC. So that makes sense.

So, AB ⊥ BC implies that BA is perpendicular to BC. And since G is on BA, then BG is part of BA, hence BG is also perpendicular to BC. So that checks out.

Now, trying to figure out how all these angles relate. Maybe I should draw a rough diagram. Let me imagine coordinates. Let me assign coordinates for simplicity. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since AB is perpendicular to BC, let me assume BC is along the x-axis and AB is along the y-axis. So, point B is at (0,0). Let me set up coordinate system such that:

- Let’s take BC as horizontal axis. So point B is at (0,0), point C is somewhere on positive x-axis, say at (c, 0). Then AB is vertical, so point A is somewhere along the y-axis. Let's say A is at (0,a) for some a > 0. Now, point G is on BA, which is the line from B(0,0) to A(0,a). So G is somewhere along the y-axis between B and A or extended. But since BG is perpendicular to BC (which is x-axis), BG is vertical, as BC is horizontal. So that aligns with our setup.

But then, there's point F which lies on BE and CD. Wait, point F lies on line BE and on line CD. Also, F lies on line CG. Also, point F lies on line CD. Wait, the constraints mention:

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(B,E)) – so F is on BE.

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(C,D)) – so F is on CD.

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(C,G)) – so F is on CG.

Also, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(C,D)) – so G is on CD. Wait, but earlier we had G on BA. So G is the intersection of BA and CD. Therefore, lines BA and CD intersect at G. So CD passes through G. Also, F is on BE, CD, and CG. Therefore, F is the intersection point of BE, CD, and CG. Hmm, complicated.

Let me try to map out the positions:

Points:

- B at (0,0)

- C at (c, 0) for some c.

- A at (0, a) for some a.

- G is on BA, so coordinates (0, g) where 0 ≤ g ≤ a or extended.

Since G is on CD. So CD connects points C(c,0) and D. Where is D?

We don't know D yet. Also, F is on CD and on CG. So line CD goes through G and F. Also, F is on BE. Let me see.

Additionally, there's point F on line BE. So line BE starts at B(0,0) and goes through E. But we don't know where E is. However, there's an angle ∠EFC = 40°, which might help later.

Also, there's ∠EBC = ∠6. So angle at B between E and C is equal to angle 6. Since E is on line BE, which passes through F. Not sure yet.

This seems complex. Maybe using coordinate geometry could help. Let me attempt to assign coordinates.

Let me fix some values for easier calculation. Let me assume specific coordinates for clarity.

Let me set B at (0,0), C at (1,0), so BC is along x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0). AB is vertical, so A is at (0, h) for some h. Let me pick h=1 for simplicity, so A is (0,1). Then BA is the line from (0,0) to (0,1). So point G is somewhere on BA. Let me denote G as (0, g), where g is between 0 and 1 or beyond.

Now, since G is on CD. So line CD passes through G(0,g). We need to define point D. Let me suppose D has coordinates (d_x, d_y). Then line CD connects C(1,0) to D(d_x, d_y) and passes through G(0,g). Let me write parametric equations for line CD.

Parametrize line CD: Starting at C(1,0), direction vector towards D(d_x - 1, d_y - 0). So parametric equations:

x = 1 + t*(d_x - 1)

y = 0 + t*d_y

This line passes through G(0,g). So there exists some parameter value t such that:

0 = 1 + t*(d_x - 1)

g = 0 + t*d_y

From first equation:

t = -1 / (d_x - 1)

Substitute into second equation:

g = (-1 / (d_x - 1)) * d_y => d_y = -g*(d_x - 1)

Therefore, coordinates of D satisfy d_y = -g*(d_x - 1). So once we know d_x, we can get d_y.

Alternatively, maybe choosing specific coordinates for D? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe considering other constraints.

Also, point F lies on line BE, line CD, and line CG. Let me think about line CG. Since G is on BA (the y-axis) and C is (1,0). So line CG connects C(1,0) to G(0,g). The equation for line CG can be determined.

Equation of line CG: passing through (1,0) and (0,g). Slope m = (g - 0)/(0 - 1) = -g. Equation is y - 0 = -g(x - 1), so y = -gx + g.

Point F lies on line CG, so its coordinates satisfy y = -gx + g. Also, F lies on line CD and on line BE. Let me consider line BE. Since E is a point such that F is on BE. But we don't know E's location. However, there's an angle ∠EBC = ∠6. Let me recall that ∠EBC is the angle at B between points E, B, and C. Since B is at (0,0), and C is at (1,0), and E is some point such that line BE forms an angle with BC (which is the x-axis). So ∠EBC is the angle between BE and BC. Given that ∠EBC = ∠6, which is some value. But without knowing ∠6, maybe we can express relations.

But perhaps instead of getting bogged down here, I should look for other given angle measures and see if I can find relationships.

Looking back at the given angles:

∠AGF = 104°, which is angle at G between A, G, F. Since A is (0,1), G is (0,g), F is on line CG. So triangle AGF? Or quadrilateral? Let me think. Since F is on line CG, which connects C(1,0) to G(0,g). So AF is connecting A(0,1) to F on CG. So angle AGF is the angle at G between points A, G, F. So that's the angle between GA and GF.

Similarly, ∠EFC = 40°, which is angle at F between E, F, C. So that's the angle between FE and FC.

Another given angle is ∠ADG = 36°, which is angle at D between A, D, G. So ∠ADG is at D between A, D, G.

Also, ∠BFD = ∠4. So angle at F between B, F, D.

And ∠BAD = ∠2, which is angle at A between B, A, D.

Hmm, this is quite involved. Maybe I need to use multiple steps and find relations between angles.

Alternatively, since there are many angles given with labels like angle 1, 2, etc., and others related to them, perhaps there is a way to set up equations.

But since we need to find angle 3, which is ∠CGB. Which is the angle at G between C, G, B. Since G is on BA, and BG is part of BA, which is vertical. Wait, BG is part of BA. Since BA is vertical, and BC is horizontal. So angle ∠CGB is the angle between GC and GB. Since GB is along BA (vertical line upwards from B), and GC connects G to C(1,0). So ∠CGB is the angle between line GC and line GB (which is BA). So that's the angle at G between C, G, B.

To compute this angle, perhaps we can find the slope of GC and then calculate the angle between GC and GB (which is vertical).

Since GB is vertical (along BA), so the angle between GC and GB would depend on the slope of GC.

Coordinates of G are (0,g), C is (1,0). So vector from G to C is (1 - 0, 0 - g) = (1, -g). The line GC has slope -g/1 = -g. The line GB is vertical, so it's along the negative y-direction from G. Wait, GB is from G(0,g) to B(0,0), which is straight down along the y-axis. So the direction of GB is downward (from G to B). The direction of GC is from G(0,g) to C(1,0), which is right and down.

The angle between GC and GB can be found using arctangent of the slope of GC relative to GB. Since GB is vertical, the angle between GC and GB is the angle whose tangent is the horizontal change over vertical change. From point G, moving to C involves horizontal component 1 unit right and vertical component -g units down. So the angle θ between GC and GB (which is vertical) satisfies tanθ = opposite/adjacent = horizontal / vertical = 1/g. So θ = arctan(1/g). Therefore, ∠CGB = arctan(1/g). But we need to find this angle, which is angle 3. So if we can find g, then we can compute this angle.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find relations involving g through other given angles.

Let me think about other given angles. For example, ∠AGF = 104°. Let me consider triangle AGF. Points A(0,1), G(0,g), F(some point on CG). So line AG is vertical from (0,1) to (0,g). Line GF is from (0,g) to F on CG.

So angle at G between A, G, F is ∠AGF = 104°. Let me find coordinates of F. Since F is on line CG, which we've already established as y = -gx + g. Also, F lies on line BE and line CD. Let me try to find coordinates of F.

But maybe I need more info. Let me consider that F is the intersection of BE, CD, and CG. Wait, F is on BE, CD, and CG. So F is the intersection of BE and CD, and also lies on CG.

So line BE: passes through B(0,0) and E. Let me denote E as some point. But since ∠EBC is given as ∠6, which is unknown. However, we might relate it with other angles.

Alternatively, maybe focusing on ∠EFC = 40°, which is angle at F between E, F, C. So in triangle EFC, ∠EFC = 40°, and maybe other angles can be related.

But this seems too vague. Perhaps another approach: using the given angles and trying to find relations via sum of angles in triangles, supplementary angles, etc.

Let me consider triangle EFC. In this triangle, ∠EFC = 40°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can find relations.

But I need more information. Alternatively, considering that point F is on CD and CG. So line CD passes through G and F. Earlier, we had that line CD passes through G(0,g) and C(1,0). Wait, no. Wait, line CD connects C(1,0) to D, and passes through G(0,g). So D is another point such that line CD passes through G. So we can write parametrically for line CD.

Earlier, we had that for line CD passing through C(1,0) and D, passing through G(0,g). So parametric equations for CD can be written as follows:

Let me parametrize line CD. Let me call the parameter s. When s=0, it's at C(1,0); when s=1, it's at D. But since it passes through G(0,g), there exists some parameter value where it reaches G.

Alternatively, since we have two points C(1,0) and G(0,g), and D is another point on line CD. Wait, but D is not necessarily between C and G. It depends on where D is located.

But since F is on CD and on CG, and also on BE. Let me try to find coordinates of F.

Since F is on line CG, which is y = -gx + g. Also, F is on line CD. But since CD passes through C(1,0) and G(0,g), so line CD is the same as line CG? No, because D is another point on line CD. Wait, but if line CD passes through C and G, then D is another point on that line. So line CD is line CG extended beyond G or C. So D could be on the extension of CG beyond G or beyond C.

But since F is on CD and CG, F is the same as being on CG. So F is a point on line CG. But also, F is on BE. So BE intersects line CG at F.

So line BE passes through B(0,0) and E. Let me find coordinates of E. Since ∠EBC = ∠6, which is some angle. If I can find the slope of BE, then I can determine coordinates of E.

But without knowing ∠6, this seems difficult. However, maybe there are other constraints that can link these angles.

Alternatively, consider triangle BFC. Since F is on BE and CD, and we have ∠EFC = 40°, and ∠BFD = ∠4. Also, ∠BFD is the angle at F between B, F, D. So in triangle BFD, we have ∠BFD = ∠4, and maybe other angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that ∠ADG = 36°. Let me think about that. Point D is on line CD, which passes through G(0,g). So ADG is the angle at D between A, D, G. So point D is connected to A and G. So line DA connects D to A(0,1), and DG connects D to G(0,g). So angle at D between those two lines is 36 degrees.

This is getting very abstract. Perhaps assigning coordinates to D would help. Let me try to define D.

Earlier, for line CD passing through C(1,0) and G(0,g), we had that D lies on line CG extended. So parametric equations for line CD (same as CG): any point on this line can be expressed as (1 - t, gt), where t is a parameter. Wait, let me verify:

At t=0: (1,0) → point C.

At t=1: (1 - 1, g*1) = (0, g) → point G.

So if we extend beyond G, t>1 gives points further along the line. So D could be at some t value. Let me denote D as (1 - t, gt) for some t. Then, depending on where D is, we can find relations.

But how does this help? Well, angle ADG is 36°, which is the angle at D between A, D, G. Let me compute vectors DA and DG to find this angle.

Point D is (1 - t, gt). Point A is (0,1). Point G is (0,g).

Vector DA = A - D = (0 - (1 - t), 1 - gt) = (t - 1, 1 - gt).

Vector DG = G - D = (0 - (1 - t), g - gt) = (t - 1, g(1 - t)).

So the angle between vectors DA and DG is 36°. Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (DA · DG) / (|DA| |DG|)

Compute DA · DG = (t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)(g(1 - t)) 

Wait, wait:

Wait, DA · DG = [(t - 1)] * [(t - 1)] + [1 - gt] * [g(1 - t)]

Note that (1 - gt) = -(gt - 1), and (1 - t) = -(t - 1). Let me factor:

Let me expand:

First term: (t - 1)^2

Second term: (1 - gt) * g(1 - t) = g(1 - t)(1 - gt) = g(1 - t)(1 - gt)

Let me factor (1 - t):

= g(1 - t)[1 - gt]

But this might not simplify easily. Let me compute numerically:

Let me denote u = t - 1. Then DA · DG becomes:

u^2 + [1 - g(t)] * g(-u) ?

Wait, perhaps better to proceed algebraically.

Let me write:

DA · DG = (t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)*[g(1 - t)]

Factor (1 - t) as -(t - 1):

= (t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)*[-g(t - 1)]

= (t - 1)^2 - g(1 - gt)(t - 1)

= (t - 1)[(t - 1) - g(1 - gt)]

Expand inside the brackets:

(t - 1) - g + g^2 t

= t - 1 - g + g² t

= t(1 + g²) - (1 + g)

Thus, DA · DG = (t - 1)[t(1 + g²) - (1 + g)]

Now, |DA| is sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)^2]

|DG| is sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + (g(1 - t))^2] = sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + g²(1 - t)^2] = |t - 1| * sqrt(1 + g²)

Therefore, cos(theta) = [ (t - 1)[t(1 + g²) - (1 + g)] ] / [ |t - 1| * sqrt(1 + g²) * sqrt((t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)^2) ) ]

Assuming t ≠ 1 (since D isn't G), we can cancel |t - 1| with (t - 1), noting that sign may matter. Let's assume t > 1, so that t - 1 is positive. Then:

cos(theta) = [ t(1 + g²) - (1 + g) ] / [ sqrt(1 + g²) * sqrt((t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)^2) )

But this expression seems complicated. However, theta is given as 36°, so:

[ t(1 + g²) - (1 + g) ] / [ sqrt(1 + g²) * sqrt((t - 1)^2 + (1 - gt)^2) ) ] = cos(36°)

This seems too complex without knowing t or g. Perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, since angle ADG is 36°, and we have points A(0,1), D(1-t, gt), G(0,g). Let me compute slopes of DA and DG to find the angle between them.

Slope of DA: from D(1 - t, gt) to A(0,1): rise over run is (1 - gt) / (0 - (1 - t)) = (1 - gt)/-(1 - t) = (gt - 1)/(1 - t)

Slope of DG: from D(1 - t, gt) to G(0,g): rise over run is (g - gt) / (0 - (1 - t)) = [g(1 - t)] / -(1 - t) = -g

So the slope of DG is -g, as expected from earlier.

So the angle between DA and DG is 36°. Let me denote m1 as slope of DA, m2 as slope of DG (-g). The angle φ between them is given by:

tanφ = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

Here, φ = 36°, so:

tan(36°) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

We have m2 = -g, m1 = (gt - 1)/(1 - t). Let me substitute:

tan(36°) = |[ -g - ((gt - 1)/(1 - t)) ] / [1 + (-g)*( (gt - 1)/(1 - t) ) ]|

This looks messy, but maybe simplifying numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -g - (gt - 1)/(1 - t) = [-g(1 - t) - (gt - 1)] / (1 - t)

Wait, let me compute:

Let me combine terms:

Let me write as:

Numerator = -g - [(gt - 1)/(1 - t)] = -g + [ (1 - gt) / (1 - t) ] 

Wait, because (gt - 1) = -(1 - gt), so:

Numerator = -g - (gt - 1)/(1 - t) = -g + (1 - gt)/(1 - t)

Let me combine terms:

Let me write -g as -g*(1 - t)/(1 - t), so:

Numerator = [ -g(1 - t) + (1 - gt) ] / (1 - t)

Expanding numerator:

-g(1 - t) + 1 - gt = -g + gt + 1 - gt = -g + 1

So numerator is (1 - g)/(1 - t)

Denominator of tanφ: 1 + [ -g * (gt - 1)/(1 - t) ] = 1 + [ g(1 - gt) / (1 - t) ]

Let me write 1 as (1 - t)/(1 - t), so:

Denominator = [ (1 - t) + g(1 - gt) ] / (1 - t)

So overall:

tanφ = | [ (1 - g)/(1 - t) ] / [ (1 - t + g(1 - gt))/ (1 - t) ] | = | (1 - g) / (1 - t + g(1 - gt)) |

Simplify denominator:

1 - t + g(1 - gt) = 1 - t + g - g²t = 1 + g - t(1 + g²)

So tanφ = | (1 - g) / [1 + g - t(1 + g²)] | = tan(36°)

So,

| (1 - g) / [1 + g - t(1 + g²)] | = tan(36°)

This equation relates t and g. However, we have another relation from point F being on BE and CD, and other angles. This seems too complex without additional info.

Perhaps there's another angle that can be used. Let me recall ∠AGF = 104°. Let me consider triangle AGF. Points A(0,1), G(0,g), F on line CG.

Since F is on line CG: y = -gx + g. Let me find coordinates of F. Let me denote F as (x_f, y_f) on CG, so y_f = -g x_f + g.

In triangle AGF, angle at G is 104°. Let me compute vectors GA and GF to find this angle.

Vector GA is from G to A: (0 - 0, 1 - g) = (0, 1 - g)

Vector GF is from G to F: (x_f - 0, y_f - g) = (x_f, y_f - g) = (x_f, -g x_f)

Because y_f = -g x_f + g, so y_f - g = -g x_f.

So vector GF is (x_f, -g x_f)

The angle between GA and GF is 104°. Using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (GA · GF) / (|GA| |GF|)

Compute GA · GF = (0)(x_f) + (1 - g)(-g x_f) = -g(1 - g)x_f

|GA| = sqrt(0² + (1 - g)^2) = |1 - g|

|GF| = sqrt(x_f² + (g x_f)^2) = |x_f| sqrt(1 + g²)

So:

cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ |1 - g| * |x_f| sqrt(1 + g²) ) ]

Assuming 1 - g and x_f are non-zero, we can simplify:

If x_f is positive or negative, but let's assume F is between C and G or extended. Let me assume F is between C and G, so x_f ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, since line CG goes from C(1,0) to G(0,g). So for F between C and G, x_f ∈ [0,1]. But if F is beyond G, x_f < 0. Depending on where F is.

But regardless, assuming x_f ≠ 0 and 1 - g ≠ 0.

Then, cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ |1 - g| * |x_f| sqrt(1 + g²) ) ] = [ -g sign(1 - g) * sign(x_f) ] / sqrt(1 + g²)

But theta is 104°, which is obtuse, so cosine is negative. Hence, the expression should be negative.

Let me drop absolute values for now and consider signs.

Case 1: Assume 1 - g > 0 (i.e., g < 1) and x_f > 0. Then:

cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ (1 - g)x_f sqrt(1 + g²) ) ] = -g / sqrt(1 + g²)

Which equals cos(104°). Since 104° is in the second quadrant, cos(104°) is negative. So:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°)

Let me compute cos(104°). Let me convert to radians if needed, but I can just use calculator approximation. But since exact value is needed, maybe we can relate this.

Let me denote:

Let me square both sides:

(g²) / (1 + g²) = cos²(104°)

So:

g² = (1 + g²) cos²(104°)

Rearranged:

g² = cos²(104°) + g² cos²(104°)

Bring terms together:

g² (1 - cos²(104°)) = cos²(104°)

Using identity 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ:

g² sin²(104°) = cos²(104°)

Thus:

g² = cot²(104°)

Taking square root:

g = ±cot(104°)

But since we assumed g < 1 (as 1 - g > 0), and cot(104°) is negative because 104° is in second quadrant (between 90° and 180°), cot(104°) = cos(104°)/sin(104°). Cos(104°) is negative, sin(104°) is positive, so cot(104°) is negative. Hence, g is negative. But earlier assumption was g < 1, but if g is negative, then G is below B on BA, which is possible.

However, this leads to g being negative, but let me check if this is consistent with other constraints.

Alternatively, maybe my assumption about the signs is incorrect. Let me re-express.

If I have:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°)

Let me compute cos(104°). Let me recall that 104° = 90° + 14°, so cos(104°) = -sin(14°) ≈ -0.2419.

Thus:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) ≈ -0.2419

Multiply both sides by -1:

g / sqrt(1 + g²) ≈ 0.2419

Square both sides:

g² / (1 + g²) ≈ 0.2419² ≈ 0.0585

So:

g² ≈ 0.0585 (1 + g²)

=> g² ≈ 0.0585 + 0.0585 g²

=> g² - 0.0585 g² ≈ 0.0585

=> 0.9415 g² ≈ 0.0585

=> g² ≈ 0.0585 / 0.9415 ≈ 0.0621

=> g ≈ sqrt(0.0621) ≈ 0.249

So g ≈ 0.25. Let's keep this approximate value for now.

So g ≈ 0.25. Thus, angle ∠CGB, which we previously said was arctan(1/g), would be arctan(1/0.25) = arctan(4) ≈ 75.96°, which is approximately 76°, matching option D. But let me check if this is accurate.

But before accepting this, I need to confirm whether this assumption is valid. Let me check if g is indeed positive. If g ≈ 0.25, then it's positive, and our initial assumption was that g < 1 (so 1 - g > 0), which holds. Also, in this case, x_f > 0, as F is between C and G.

But wait, if g ≈ 0.25, then from earlier equation, g ≈ 0.25, and ∠CGB ≈ arctan(1/g) ≈ arctan(4) ≈ 75.96°, which is close to 76°, so option D. But let me check if there are other constraints that might affect this.

But let me verify with other given angles. For instance, we have ∠EFC = 40°, and ∠BFD = ∠4. Also, ∠ADG = 36°, which we used in deriving g ≈ 0.25. But how do we know if this is consistent?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the sign. Let me revisit the earlier equation:

From the angle between GA and GF being 104°, we derived that g ≈ 0.25. Let me check if this value of g satisfies the other condition from ∠ADG = 36°.

Recall that earlier, we had from angle ADG:

tan(36°) = | (1 - g) / [1 + g - t(1 + g²)] | 

But we need to relate t with g. How?

Well, point F is on line CG and on BE. Let me try to find coordinates of F.

Since F is on line CG: y = -gx + g.

Also, F is on line BE. Let me find equation of line BE. Since E is some point such that ∠EBC = ∠6. But without knowing ∠6, it's hard to find E directly. However, maybe we can relate it with other angles.

Alternatively, consider triangle EFC with ∠EFC = 40°, and other angles.

But this seems too vague. Let me think differently. If I assume g ≈ 0.25, let me try to see if other conditions hold.

For example, with g = 0.25, let's compute the value of t from the angle ADG condition.

From earlier, we had:

tan(36°) = | (1 - g) / [1 + g - t(1 + g²)] | 

Plugging g = 0.25:

1 - g = 0.75

1 + g = 1.25

1 + g² = 1 + 0.0625 = 1.0625

So:

tan(36°) ≈ 0.7265 = | 0.75 / (1.25 - t * 1.0625) | 

Assuming t is chosen such that denominator is positive, let's solve:

0.75 / (1.25 - 1.0625 t) = 0.7265

So:

1.25 - 1.0625 t = 0.75 / 0.7265 ≈ 1.032

Then:

1.25 - 1.032 = 1.0625 t

0.218 = 1.0625 t → t ≈ 0.218 / 1.0625 ≈ 0.205

So t ≈ 0.205. Thus, point D is at (1 - t, gt) = (1 - 0.205, 0.25 * 0.205) ≈ (0.795, 0.05125).

Now, let me check if with this t and g, other conditions hold. For example, point F is on line BE and line CD.

But without knowing E, it's hard to say. However, let me try to find F.

Since F is on line CG: y = -0.25x + 0.25.

Also, F is on line BE. To find E, we need more info. But maybe we can use ∠EFC = 40°. Let me assume that with these values, this condition is satisfied.

Alternatively, since this approach is getting too tangled, and the approximate value of g gives us angle ∠CGB ≈ 76°, which is option D, and given that in such problems often the answer is among the choices, and given that the calculation led to approx 76°, I might conclude that the answer is D. But let me check for consistency.

Alternatively, let me consider exact trigonometric identities. Suppose that from the angle AGF = 104°, we had:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°)

Let me rearrange:

g = -sqrt(1 + g²) * cos(104°)

Square both sides:

g² = (1 + g²) cos²(104°)

As before, leading to g² = cot²(104°), so g = ±cot(104°). Since 104° is in second quadrant, cot(104°) is negative. So g is negative. Wait, this contradicts our previous assumption that g is positive. What's wrong here?

Ah! Earlier, I assumed that 1 - g > 0 and x_f > 0, leading to g positive. But according to this, g is negative. There's inconsistency here. Let me re-examine.

From the equation:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°)

Since cos(104°) is negative, the left side must be negative. Hence, -g must be positive, so g is negative.

Therefore, g is negative. Let me redo the calculation with g negative.

Let me denote g = -k, where k > 0.

Then:

- g / sqrt(1 + g²) = k / sqrt(1 + k²) = cos(104°)

But cos(104°) is negative, so this would require k / sqrt(...) to be negative, which it isn't, since k > 0. Contradiction!

Wait, this suggests a mistake in earlier reasoning. Let me go back.

Original equation: cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ |1 - g| * |x_f| sqrt(1 + g²) ) ]

If g is negative, then 1 - g is positive (since g is negative, subtracting a negative adds), and x_f could be positive or negative. Let me reconsider.

If g is negative, then let's assume g < 0. Let me suppose F is on line CG extended beyond G, so x_f < 0. Let me assume x_f < 0, so |x_f| = -x_f.

Then, the expression becomes:

cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ (1 - g)(-x_f) sqrt(1 + g²) ) ] 

Wait, because |x_f| = -x_f if x_f < 0, and |1 - g| = 1 - g since g < 0.

So numerator: -g(1 - g)x_f

Denominator: (1 - g)(-x_f) sqrt(...)

Thus, cos(theta) = [ -g(1 - g)x_f ] / [ (1 - g)(-x_f) sqrt(...) ] = [ -g / -sqrt(...) ] = g / sqrt(1 + g²)

But theta is 104°, which has cos(theta) negative. So g / sqrt(1 + g²) must be negative, implying g < 0, which matches our assumption. So:

g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°)

But cos(104°) is negative, so g is negative. Let me write:

g = cos(104°) * sqrt(1 + g²)

Square both sides:

g² = cos²(104°) (1 + g²)

Rearrange:

g² = cos²(104°) + g² cos²(104°)

g² (1 - cos²(104°)) = cos²(104°)

g² = cos²(104°) / sin²(104°) = cot²(104°)

So g = ±cot(104°). Since we're in the case where g < 0, g = -cot(104°).

Calculate cot(104°):

cot(104°) = 1/tan(104°). Tan(104°) = tan(90° + 14°) = -cot(14°) ≈ -4.0108

Thus, cot(104°) ≈ -1/4.0108 ≈ -0.2493

Hence, g = -cot(104°) ≈ 0.2493

Wait, this is positive! Wait, no: cot(104°) is negative, so g = -cot(104°) is positive. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:

If g = -cot(104°), and cot(104°) is negative (since 104° is in second quadrant), then g = -negative = positive. So g is positive. But earlier we thought g is negative. This contradiction indicates a mistake in the sign handling.

Let me recast:

From g / sqrt(1 + g²) = cos(104°), and since cos(104°) is negative, g must be negative. But solving gives g = -cot(104°). Let me calculate cot(104°):

As above, cot(104°) = 1/tan(104°) = 1/tan(90°+14°) = 1/(-cot(14°)) = -tan(14°) ≈ -0.2493. So cot(104°) ≈ -0.2493. Thus, g = -cot(104°) ≈ 0.2493, which is positive. This suggests that g is positive, which resolves the contradiction. So g is positive, approximately 0.2493, which is around 0.25.

So this confirms that g is positive, approximately 0.25, and thus ∠CGB = arctan(1/g) ≈ arctan(4) ≈ 75.96°, which is approximately 76°, corresponding to option D.

Now, let me verify if this value of g satisfies the condition from ∠ADG = 36°.

With g ≈ 0.25, let's revisit the earlier equation from angle ADG:

tan(36°) = | (1 - g) / [1 + g - t(1 + g²)] | 

With g = 0.25, 1 - g = 0.75, 1 + g = 1.25, 1 + g² = 1.0625.

So:

tan(36°) ≈ 0.7265 = | 0.75 / (1.25 - t * 1.0625) | 

Solving for t:

1.25 - 1.0625 t = 0.75 / 0.7265 ≈ 1.032

So:

1.0625 t = 1.25 - 1.032 = 0.218

t ≈ 0.218 / 1.0625 ≈ 0.205

So t ≈ 0.205, which is between 0 and 1, meaning point D is between C and G. Wait, but earlier we said line CD passes through G and D. If t=0.205, then D is between C and G, since t=0 corresponds to C and t=1 corresponds to G. Wait, earlier parametrization was D at (1 - t, gt), so when t=0.205, D is at (1 - 0.205, 0.25 * 0.205) ≈ (0.795, 0.05125). So yes, D is between C(1,0) and G(0,0.25).

Now, with this D, let's check if other conditions hold. For example, point F is on line CD and BE. Let me find coordinates of F.

Since F is on line CG: y = -gx + g = -0.25x + 0.25.

Also, F is on line BE. Let me find equation of BE. To find E, we need more info, but let's try to use ∠EFC = 40°.

Point F is on line CG: let's denote F as (x, -0.25x + 0.25). Let me find coordinates of F.

But since F is also on line CD. Line CD goes from C(1,0) to D(0.795, 0.05125). Let me find the equation of line CD.

Slope of CD: (0.05125 - 0)/(0.795 - 1) = 0.05125 / (-0.205) ≈ -0.25.

Wait, interesting! The slope of CD is -0.25, which is the same as the slope of CG, which makes sense since D is on line CG. So line CD is the same as line CG. Thus, F is a point on line CG, which is the same as line CD. So this confirms that F is on line CD and CG.

Now, to find F, we need it to be on BE. Let me assume that E is some point such that line BE passes through F. Let me find coordinates of E.

But without knowing E, it's challenging. However, we have ∠EFC = 40°. Let me consider triangle EFC with F on line CG, C at (1,0), and E somewhere.

Let me assume F is at some point on CG. Let me choose a parameter for F. Let me parameterize F along CG.

Let me use parameter s such that F divides CG in ratio s:(1-s), but it might be easier to use the parametric form.

Line CG goes from C(1,0) to G(0,0.25). Parametric equations: x = 1 - t, y = 0 + 0.25t, where t ∈ [0,1] gives segment CG. For t > 1, it extends beyond G.

Let me choose t = 0.205, which gave us D at t=0.205. Wait, no, earlier we had t=0.205 for D, but F is another point on line CG. Let me assume F is at some parameter value, say, t = k, giving F at (1 - k, 0.25k).

Now, ∠EFC = 40°. Let me try to find E such that this angle holds.

But this requires knowledge of E. Let me consider that line BE passes through F. Let me assume E is some point such that BE passes through F. Let me denote E as (e_x, e_y), and since F is on BE, we can write parametric equations for BE.

But without more constraints, this is underdetermined. However, perhaps using other given angles.

Alternatively, let me consider that ∠EBC = ∠6, which is some angle. Let me calculate ∠EBC.

Point E is on line BE, which passes through F. So ∠EBC is the angle between BE and BC. Since BC is along x-axis from B(0,0) to C(1,0). So the angle between BE and x-axis is ∠EBC.

Let me find the slope of BE. Since BE passes through B(0,0) and F(1 - k, 0.25k). So slope of BE is (0.25k - 0)/(1 - k - 0) = 0.25k / (1 - k). Thus, ∠EBC is the angle whose tangent is 0.25k / (1 - k).

But ∠EBC = ∠6, which is some value, but we don't know it. However, perhaps relating it with other angles.

Alternatively, consider triangle EFC. With F on BE and line CF, we have ∠EFC = 40°. Let me use coordinates to find this angle.

Point E is on line BE: parametric equations: any point on BE can be expressed as (e_x, e_y) = (λ * (1 - k), λ * 0.25k), where λ is a scalar parameter (since BE passes through B(0,0) and F(1 - k, 0.25k)).

Let me choose λ = 1 to get F itself, and λ > 1 to get points beyond F.

Let me take E as a point on BE such that λ = 1 + m, for some m > 0, extending BE beyond F.

But without knowing m, it's still ambiguous. However, perhaps using the law of sines or cosines in triangle EFC.

But this seems too open-ended. Given the complexity, and since our earlier calculation for ∠CGB ≈ 76°, which is option D, and given that the approximate calculation fits, I will proceed with this conclusion.

Thus, the measure of ∠3 (which is ∠CGB) is approximately 76°, so the correct answer is D.
