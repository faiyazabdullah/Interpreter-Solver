Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me list out all the information provided:

1. Angle at point C between points B and A (Angle(C, B, A)) is 90 degrees. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C? Wait, but points might not form a triangle directly. Maybe there's more structure here.

2. Angle at point I between points A and G (Angle(I, A, G)) is 157 degrees. So that's angle IAG = 157°.

3. Angle at point H between points C and E (Angle(H, C, E)) equals angle 1. So ∠HCE = ∠1.

Other constraints:

- Point C lies on line BH. So line BH passes through C.

- Point A lies on line BI. So line BI passes through A.

- Point A also lies on line DG. So line DG passes through A.

- Point C lies on line EF. So line EF passes through C.

- Lines FE and DG are parallel. Since FE is part of line EF, which contains point C, and DG is another line passing through A.

So, first, maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

Starting with the right angle at C for angle CBA. So points B, C, A such that angle at C is 90°, meaning BC is perpendicular to AC. Then, point C is on line BH. So line BH goes through C. Also, point A is on BI and DG. So lines BI and DG both pass through A.

Also, FE is parallel to DG. Since DG passes through A, and FE is parallel to DG, so FE is parallel to DG. And FE passes through C because C is on EF. Therefore, line FE is parallel to DG, which passes through A. 

Now, looking at angle IAG being 157°. That angle is at point A, between points I and G. Since A is on BI and DG, perhaps points I, A, G are arranged such that IA is part of line BI, and AG is part of line DG?

Wait, since A is on DG, then line DG passes through A. So if we consider line DG, then point G is somewhere along that line. Similarly, point I is connected to A via line BI. So angle IAG is formed at point A, with sides going towards I and G. Given that angle IAG is 157°, which seems quite large, almost straight. 

But how does this relate to angle 1, which is equal to angle HCE. So angle HCE is at point C, between points H and E. Since C is on line EF, so line EF passes through C. Therefore, point E and F are on line EF, with C lying somewhere on it. Also, line FE is parallel to DG. 

Let me think about the relationships here. Since FE || DG, and DG passes through A, then maybe some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles could be involved. Also, considering the right angle at C, which is part of triangle ABC or something else.

Let me try to find relations between angles. The key is probably to use the fact that FE || DG, so when they intersect with transversals, certain angles will be equal or supplementary.

Since FE is parallel to DG, and if we can find a transversal that intersects them, like line EC or something else. Wait, point C is on EF, so line EC is part of EF. If DG is parallel to EF, then line EC would be a transversal cutting DG and EF. Wait, but DG passes through A, so unless A is on line EC... Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, since point C is on EF, and DG is parallel to EF, then DG is parallel to line EF. So if we can find a relationship between angles involving these lines.

Another thing: angle at HCE is equal to angle 1. So ∠HCE = ∠1. So if I can find ∠HCE, that gives me the measure of angle 1.

To find ∠HCE, maybe we can look at triangle HCE or some other triangle involving those points. But I need to figure out how the points are connected.

Given that point C is on BH and on EF. Also, point A is on BI and DG. Let me try to map out possible connections.

First, line BH passes through C. So B----C----H? Or C is somewhere between B and H? Not sure. Similarly, line EF passes through C. So E----C----F? Or C is between E and F?

Also, since FE is parallel to DG, and DG passes through A. So DG is parallel to FE. So if I can find a way to relate angles around point C or other points.

Let me think about the right angle at C. So angle BCA is 90°, as per the first constraint. So triangle BCA is right-angled at C. So BC ⊥ AC.

If I can find coordinates for some points, maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Since angle at C is 90°, so BC and AC are perpendicular. Let me assume BC is along the x-axis and AC is along the y-axis.

So let’s assign coordinates:

Let’s say point C is at (0, 0).

Let’s take point B along the x-axis: let's say B is at (b, 0) for some b > 0.

Point A is along the y-axis: let's say A is at (0, a) for some a > 0.

Then, line BI passes through A. So line BI connects points B and I, passing through A. So point I is somewhere on line BI extended beyond A or before B?

Similarly, line DG passes through A. So DG is another line passing through A. Also, DG is parallel to FE. And FE is the line containing point C (since C is on EF). So FE is line EF, which passes through C (origin). So FE is a line passing through C (origin). Since DG is parallel to FE, DG has the same slope as FE.

But without knowing specific coordinates of E and F, maybe this approach is too vague. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or slopes?

Alternatively, think about angles and parallel lines.

Since FE || DG, then the direction of DG is same as FE. So if I can find the slope of FE, then DG has same slope.

But since DG passes through A, which is (0, a) in my coordinate system. Suppose FE is line EF passing through C (origin). Let me suppose FE is horizontal or vertical? Well, depends on the configuration.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way.

Let me focus on angle IAG = 157°. This angle is at point A, between points I and G. Since A is on line BI and DG. So line BI passes through A, so I is on BI extended. Similarly, G is on DG extended.

So angle between BI and DG at point A is 157°. So if I can find the relationship between BI and DG, perhaps through their slopes?

But again, without exact positions, it's tricky. However, since DG is parallel to FE, and FE passes through C, which is connected to other elements.

Wait, since FE || DG, and DG passes through A, then FE is parallel to DG. So if I can find some transversal that crosses both FE and DG, creating angles that relate to each other.

For example, if line EC crosses FE and DG, then the angles formed would have some relation. Since C is on FE, line EC is part of FE. Therefore, line EC is a transversal cutting DG and FE. Since FE || DG, then angle between EC and DG would be equal to angle between EC and FE, due to parallel lines.

Wait, but EC is part of FE, which is parallel to DG. So if we consider line EC (which is along FE) and line DG, then the angle between EC and DG would be equal to 180° minus the angle between FE and DG? Wait, no. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if line EC is a transversal crossing FE and DG, then the angle between EC and FE would be supplementary to the angle between EC and DG.

But since FE || DG, and EC is a transversal. So angle between EC and FE (at point C) plus angle between EC and DG (at point where DG meets EC) equals 180°.

But I'm not sure where EC meets DG. Unless EC meets DG at point A? Wait, point A is on DG. Is point A on EC? Not necessarily. Unless EC is connected to A somehow.

Alternatively, since point C is on EF, and DG is parallel to EF. If I can connect point A to C or something else.

Alternatively, think about triangle HCE. We need to find angle HCE, which is equal to angle 1. How can we relate this angle to others?

Since point C is on line BH and line EF. Also, point H is on line BH. So line BH passes through C and H. So points B, C, H are colinear. Similarly, line EF passes through C and points E and F.

Maybe there's a quadrilateral or some triangle involving these points.

Alternatively, since angle IAG is 157°, which is quite large. In a plane, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but angle IAG is just one angle. If we can relate this angle to other angles in the diagram.

Wait, angle IAG is formed at point A between lines AI and AG. Since AI is part of line BI, and AG is part of line DG. Since DG is parallel to FE, which passes through C. Maybe there's a way to find the angle between BI and DG, which is 157°, and then use that to find other angles.

But how?

Alternatively, since DG || FE, and FE passes through C, and DG passes through A. So if we can create a transversal connecting A to C, then the angles formed by this transversal with DG and FE would be related.

Suppose we draw line AC. Since AC is part of the right angle at C. From earlier, in my coordinate system, AC was along the y-axis from C(0,0) to A(0,a). So line AC is vertical. Then, DG is parallel to FE. If I can find the slope of DG, which is same as FE.

But FE passes through C(0,0). Let me assume that FE has some slope m. Then DG also has slope m. Now, line DG passes through A(0,a). So equation of DG is y - a = m(x - 0) => y = mx + a.

But FE is the line through C(0,0) with slope m, so its equation is y = mx.

Since DG is parallel to FE, they have the same slope m. Now, if I consider line AC, which is vertical (x=0), and see how it interacts with DG and FE.

But maybe this isn't helping directly. Let me think about the angle IAG. At point A, between AI and AG. Since AI is part of line BI, and AG is part of DG.

In my coordinate system, point A is at (0,a). Line BI passes through B(b,0) and A(0,a). So the slope of BI is (a - 0)/(0 - b) = -a/b. Equation of BI: y - 0 = (-a/b)(x - b) → y = (-a/b)x + a.

Point I is somewhere on this line. Similarly, line DG has slope m, and passes through A(0,a). So equation y = m x + a.

The angle between BI and DG at point A is 157°. To find the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2, the formula is tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|. But since the angle is obtuse (157°), we might need to consider the supplement.

Let me denote m1 as the slope of BI, which is -a/b. Let m2 be the slope of DG, which is m. Then, the angle theta between them satisfies:

tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

But theta is 157°, which is obtuse. However, the tangent function gives positive values for acute angles. For obtuse angles, the actual angle between the lines is the supplement of the acute angle formed.

So, the angle between two lines is either theta or 180° - theta, depending on orientation. Since 157° is obtuse, it means that the angle between the lines is 157°, so the acute angle between them would be 180° - 157° = 23°. So tan(23°) ≈ 0.424.

Therefore,

|(m - (-a/b))/(1 + (-a/b)*m)| = tan(23°)

Which simplifies to:

| (m + a/b ) / (1 - (a m)/b ) | = tan(23°)

This gives us a relationship between m and a/b. But without knowing specific values, this might not be helpful. Perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, since DG is parallel to FE, and FE passes through C(0,0). Let's consider the direction of DG. If FE has slope m, then DG also has slope m. If I can find m in terms of other known quantities.

But how?

Alternatively, think about triangle HCE. Need to find angle at C between H and E. Since C is on BH and EF. So line BH passes through C and H. Line EF passes through C and E, F.

If I can find some relationship between BH and EF, or other lines.

Alternatively, since FE || DG, and DG passes through A, which is connected to BI. Maybe there's a parallelogram or similar figures involved.

Alternatively, think about the entire diagram. There are several lines and points with various constraints. It's getting complicated. Maybe focusing on the angles given.

We know angle IAG is 157°, which is at A. Also, angle at C is 90°, and angle HCE equals angle 1. Need to find angle 1.

Perhaps there's a way to express angle 1 in terms of other angles using parallel lines and transversals.

Since FE || DG, and assuming that line EC is a transversal. Wait, EC is part of FE, since C is on FE. So line EC is along FE. Thus, EC is a transversal cutting DG and FE. Since FE || DG, the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary.

But where does EC meet DG? If EC intersects DG at some point. If point A is on DG, and if EC passes through A, then EC would intersect DG at A. Is that true?

Is point A on line EC? Not necessarily unless specified. But in our setup, point A is on line DG, and line EC is part of FE, which passes through C. So unless line EC connects to A, which isn't stated. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe there's another transversal. For example, line HC, which is part of BH, since point H is on BH. So line HC is part of BH, which passes through C. So line HC is BH itself. If BH is a transversal cutting FE and DG?

Wait, FE || DG, and BH is a transversal. So the angles formed by BH intersecting FE and DG would be related.

At point C, line BH intersects FE (since C is on FE). So the angle between BH and FE at point C is some angle. Then, since DG is parallel to FE, the angle between BH and DG would be the same as that angle, or supplementary, depending on the side.

But how does that help us?

Alternatively, since angle at C is 90°, which is angle BCA. If line BH passes through C, then angle between BC and BH at point C is... Well, BC is part of the original right angle. Let me think.

In my coordinate system, BC is along x-axis from B(b,0) to C(0,0). Line BH passes through C and extends to H. So line BH is along the x-axis from B to C to H. Wait, if B is at (b,0), C at (0,0), then line BH is the x-axis extending from B through C to H. So the angle between BC and BH at C is zero, since they are the same line. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no—line BH passes through C, so if B is at (b,0) and C is at (0,0), then line BH is the line from B through C to H. So BC is part of BH. So angle at C between BC and BH is zero? No, because BH is the same line as BC extended beyond C to H. So angle between BC and BH at C is undefined because they are collinear. So maybe this suggests that my coordinate assumption isn't capturing the full picture. Perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the position of points. Let me rethink.

Let me start over with coordinates.

Let me set point C at (0,0), as before.

Let me define point B at (0, b) and point A at (a, 0), making angle at C (between B, C, A) a right angle. Wait, this would make angle BCA = 90°, since BC is vertical from C(0,0) to B(0,b), and CA is horizontal from C(0,0) to A(a,0). Yes, that forms a right angle at C.

Now, line BH passes through C. So point H is somewhere on line BH. Since B is at (0, b), and C is at (0,0), line BH is the vertical line x=0. So point H is on the y-axis. So H is somewhere along the y-axis, possibly above or below C.

Similarly, point A is on line BI and on line DG. Let me handle line BI first. Point A is on line BI. Since B is at (0,b), and A is at (a,0), then line BI passes through B(0,b) and A(a,0). So the equation of line BI is from (0,b) to (a,0). Slope is (0 - b)/(a - 0) = -b/a. Equation is y = (-b/a)x + b.

Point I is somewhere on this line. Similarly, line DG passes through A(a,0). Also, DG is parallel to FE, which passes through C(0,0). So line FE is parallel to DG.

Assume that line FE has some slope m, so DG also has slope m. Since DG passes through A(a,0), its equation is y - 0 = m(x - a), so y = m(x - a).

Now, line FE passes through C(0,0), so its equation is y = m x.

Since FE || DG, they have the same slope m.

Now, angle IAG is 157°, which is the angle at A between points I and G. So angle between lines AI and AG at point A is 157°.

Point I is on line BI, which we've defined. Point G is on line DG, which we've defined. So line AG is part of DG, since G is on DG. Wait, no—point G is on DG, so AG is a segment from A to G on DG. So the angle between AI (from A to I) and AG (from A to G) is 157°.

To find this angle, we can calculate the angle between lines AI and AG. Let me find the slopes of AI and AG.

First, line AI is part of BI, which has slope -b/a. So the slope of AI is -b/a.

Line AG is part of DG, which has slope m. So the angle between BI (slope -b/a) and DG (slope m) at point A is 157°.

Using the formula for the angle θ between two lines with slopes m1 and m2:

tanθ = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

Here, θ is 157°, but since tanθ is positive for acute angles, and 157° is obtuse, the actual angle between the lines is 180° - 157° = 23°, so:

tan(23°) = |(m - (-b/a)) / (1 + (-b/a)*m)|

Simplify:

tan(23°) = |(m + b/a) / (1 - (b/a)m)|

Let me call this Equation (1).

Now, we also know that line FE is parallel to DG, which has slope m. Line FE passes through C(0,0), so FE is y = mx.

Additionally, point C is on line EF, which is FE. Also, point C is on line BH, which is the y-axis (since B is at (0,b) and C is at (0,0)). So line BH is the y-axis. Hence, point H is on the y-axis.

Now, angle HCE is equal to angle 1. Let's find angle HCE.

Point H is on the y-axis (since line BH is the y-axis). Point C is at (0,0), and point E is on line FE (y = mx). So line CE is from C(0,0) to E, which is some point on FE. Let me parametrize point E.

Let me assume point E is on FE, which is y = mx. Let me choose a parameter t such that E is at (t, mt). Since FE is infinite, E can be anywhere along this line.

But angle HCE is the angle at C between points H and E. Since H is on the y-axis, and E is on FE (y=mx). So vector CH is along the y-axis (from C(0,0) to H, which is on the y-axis), and vector CE is from C(0,0) to E(t, mt).

Thus, angle HCE is the angle between vector CH (along y-axis) and vector CE (to point E on FE).

The slope of CE is m, since it's along FE. So the angle between CH (vertical) and CE (slope m) is equal to arctangent of the slope m. Because if you have a line with slope m, the angle it makes with the vertical axis is complementary to the angle it makes with the horizontal axis.

Wait, the angle between a line with slope m and the vertical axis is 90° - θ, where θ is the angle with the horizontal axis. Since tanθ = |m|. So the angle between the line and the vertical axis is φ = 90° - θ, so tanφ = cotθ = 1/m.

Wait, actually, if the line makes angle θ with the x-axis, then it makes angle φ = 90° - θ with the y-axis. So tanφ = tan(90° - θ) = cotθ = 1/tanθ = 1/m. So φ = arctan(1/m).

But angle HCE is this φ, which is arctan(1/m). So angle HCE = arctan(1/m). Therefore, angle 1 = arctan(1/m).

So if we can find m, then we can compute angle 1.

From earlier, we had Equation (1):

tan(23°) = |(m + b/a) / (1 - (b/a)m)|

But we don't know b/a. However, maybe there's another relationship involving m.

Recall that line DG has slope m and passes through A(a,0). Also, line DG is parallel to FE (which has slope m). Additionally, there's point G on DG, and line BI passes through A. But I'm not sure how to connect this.

Alternatively, since angle IAG is 157°, and we have expressed tan(23°) in terms of m and b/a. But without knowing b/a, we can't proceed numerically. However, perhaps there's a relationship from the diagram that allows us to eliminate variables.

Wait, but maybe we can consider that the angle between BI and DG is 157°, and since DG is parallel to FE, which is connected to point C.

Alternatively, since FE is parallel to DG, and FE passes through C(0,0), while DG passes through A(a,0). Maybe there's a connection between triangles or something.

Alternatively, let's consider the slope m. If we can express m in terms of other knowns, or find another equation involving m.

Wait, but we only have one equation from the angle between BI and DG. We need another equation to solve for m. But where can we get another equation?

Perhaps from the fact that line FE is parallel to DG, and there's another condition involving point E and H? Not sure.

Wait, angle HCE is equal to angle 1, which is arctan(1/m). Also, maybe there's a relationship between angle HCE and other angles in the diagram.

Alternatively, since line BH is the y-axis, and H is on BH (the y-axis), and point E is on FE (y = mx), and line CE is from C(0,0) to E(t, mt). So angle HCE is the angle between CH (along y-axis) and CE (slope m). As discussed, angle HCE = arctan(1/m). So angle 1 = arctan(1/m).

If we can find m, then we can find angle 1.

From Equation (1):

tan(23°) = |(m + b/a) / (1 - (b/a)m)|

Let me denote k = b/a, which is a constant ratio. Then:

tan(23°) = |(m + k) / (1 - km)|

But without knowing k, we cannot determine m. So this suggests that there's missing information, or perhaps another relationship involving k.

Wait, but maybe there's another constraint from the diagram. For instance, point A is also on line DG. Wait, DG is already passing through A, as per the constraint. Also, point A is on line DG, which has slope m. So line DG is y = m(x - a). But what else?

Is there a relationship between line DG and other parts of the diagram? Like, maybe line DG intersects with another line, or relates to point G?

Alternatively, since angle IAG is 157°, and we're trying to find angle 1, which is arctan(1/m). Maybe there's a way to relate these angles through the diagram.

Wait, if I consider the total angles around point A. At point A, we have angle IAG = 157°, and other angles. But since A is on line BI and DG, perhaps there are other angles at A?

For example, line BI passes through A, and line DG passes through A. So the angle between BI and DG is 157°, as given. Are there other lines at A?

Not sure. Maybe not enough info.

Alternatively, think about the fact that angle at C is 90°, and angle HCE is angle 1, which is arctan(1/m). Maybe there's a relationship between angle 1 and the other angles.

Alternatively, since FE || DG, and line CE is part of FE, then line DG is parallel to FE, so the distance between DG and FE is constant. But not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|. Let me assume that k is positive, as b and a are lengths. Let me drop the absolute value by assuming the denominator is positive. So:

(m + k)/(1 - km) = tan(23°)

But this is one equation with two variables m and k. So unless there's another equation relating m and k, we can't solve it. But where can we find another equation?

Wait, maybe there's a relationship involving point G and other lines? Or perhaps something with point E?

Alternatively, since FE is parallel to DG, and line DG passes through A, and line FE passes through C, perhaps there's a translation or homothety connecting them? Not sure.

Alternatively, since line DG is parallel to FE, and point A is on DG, and point C is on FE, then the distance between DG and FE is the same everywhere. But without knowing specific positions, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that angle IAG is 157°, which is very close to 180°, implying that lines BI and DG are nearly opposite directions, forming a very narrow angle. But since it's 157°, the smaller angle between them is 23°, as mentioned before.

But how does this help us find m?

Wait, if we assume that the lines BI and DG are such that the angle between them is 23°, and we have tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|. If we can assume some value for k, like k = 1, for simplicity? But why would k be 1?

Wait, in our coordinate system, k = b/a. If we assume some arbitrary values for b and a, but since we don't have specific measurements, it's unclear. However, maybe there's a special case where k is chosen such that the angle between BI and DG is 23°, leading to a solvable equation for m.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a geometric constraint I missed. Let me check all given constraints again.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), 90): confirmed, angle at C is 90°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(I, A, G)), 157): angle at A is 157°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H, C, E)), MeasureOf(Angle(1)): angle at C between H and E is angle 1.

- PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B, H)): C is on BH.

- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, I)): A is on BI.

- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, G)): A is on DG.

- PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(E, F)): C is on EF.

- Parallel(Line(F, E), Line(D, G)): FE || DG.

No other constraints. So maybe the key is to realize that angle 1 is supplementary or complementary to angle IAG or something related.

Wait, since FE || DG, and line AC is from A to C, which is from (a,0) to (0,0). So line AC has slope (0-0)/(0-a) = 0? No, wait, from A(a,0) to C(0,0), it's horizontal line? No, from A(a,0) to C(0,0) is along x-axis. Wait, yes! In my coordinate system, A is at (a,0), C is at (0,0), so AC is horizontal line from A to C. So line AC is horizontal.

Now, since FE || DG, and line AC intersects both FE and DG. Let's examine the angles formed by this intersection.

Line AC is horizontal. Line FE is y = mx, and line DG is y = m(x - a).

Intersection of AC (y=0) with FE: set y=0 in y=mx → 0 = mx → x=0. So intersection at point C(0,0).

Intersection of AC with DG: set y=0 in y = m(x - a) → 0 = m(x - a) → x = a. So intersection at point A(a,0).

So line AC intersects FE at C and DG at A. Thus, line AC is a transversal cutting FE and DG at C and A respectively.

Since FE || DG, the angles formed by transversal AC with FE and DG should be related.

At point C, the transversal AC intersects FE (which is y=mx) at C(0,0). The angle between AC (horizontal) and FE (slope m) is φ = arctan(m), as it is the angle between horizontal line and line FE.

At point A, the transversal AC intersects DG at A(a,0). The angle between AC (horizontal) and DG (slope m) is the same as φ = arctan(m), because DG is parallel to FE. So the angle between AC and DG is also arctan(m).

But wait, the angle between AC and DG at A is arctan(m)? Let me think.

Line AC is horizontal (from A(a,0) to C(0,0)), so it's along the x-axis. Line DG has slope m, so the angle between AC (x-axis) and DG is arctan(m). So that angle is φ = arctan(m).

But also, at point C, the angle between AC (x-axis) and FE (slope m) is φ = arctan(m). So these are equal, as expected due to parallel lines.

Now, let's consider the angle between BI and DG at point A, which is 157°. Earlier, we had that the angle between BI (slope -k) and DG (slope m) is 157°, giving us tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|.

But also, the angle between AC (horizontal) and DG is φ = arctan(m). And angle between AC and BI is some value.

Since BI has slope -k, the angle between BI and AC (horizontal) is θ = arctan(k), since slope is -k, so the angle from x-axis to BI is arctan(|slope|) = arctan(k), but in the second quadrant.

So, at point A, we have two lines: BI (with slope -k) and DG (slope m), forming an angle of 157°. Also, AC is horizontal, forming angles with both BI and DG.

Let me try to relate these angles. The angle between BI and DG is 157°, which can be expressed as the difference between the angles that BI and DG make with AC.

Let me denote α as the angle between BI and AC, β as the angle between DG and AC. Then, the angle between BI and DG is either α + β or |α - β|, depending on their relative orientations.

Since BI has slope -k, which is negative, so it goes from B(0,b) down to A(a,0), making an angle α with the x-axis (AC). Since slope is -k, the angle α is measured from AC (positive x-axis) upwards to BI, but since slope is negative, it's actually measured downwards from the x-axis. Wait, the angle between BI and AC (x-axis) would be the acute angle between them.

Let me clarify: the angle between BI and AC is the smallest angle between them. Since BI has slope -k, the angle α is arctan(k), because the magnitude of the slope is k.

Similarly, the angle between DG and AC is β = arctan(m).

Now, the angle between BI and DG at point A is either α + β or |α - β|, depending on whether they are on the same side or opposite sides of AC.

But since the angle between BI and DG is 157°, which is obtuse, it suggests that α + β = 157°, because if α and β are both acute, their sum could be obtuse.

So, α + β = 157°, where α = arctan(k), β = arctan(m).

So:

arctan(k) + arctan(m) = 157°

But earlier, we had from the angle between BI and DG:

tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|

But if α + β = 157°, then β = 157° - α.

So, β = 157° - α

Taking tan of both sides:

tan(β) = tan(157° - α)

But tan(β) = m, and tan(alpha) = k.

Let me expand tan(157° - alpha):

tan(157° - alpha) = [tan(157°) - tan(alpha)] / [1 + tan(157°) * tan(alpha)]

But this seems complex. Alternatively, since beta = 157° - alpha, and beta = arctan(m), alpha = arctan(k), so:

m = tan(beta) = tan(157° - alpha) = tan(157° - arctan(k))

This is still complex, but maybe we can substitute.

Alternatively, recall that from earlier, we had:

tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|

And also, from alpha + beta = 157°, with alpha = arctan(k), beta = arctan(m).

Let me assume that alpha and beta are positive acute angles, so their sum is 157°, which is greater than 90°, so one of them must be greater than 45°, and the other less.

But how do these equations relate?

Let me try substituting m = tan(beta), k = tan(alpha), and beta = 157° - alpha.

So, m = tan(157° - alpha)

But alpha = arctan(k), so:

m = tan(157° - arctan(k))

Let me compute this expression.

Let me denote gamma = arctan(k), so alpha = gamma, and beta = 157° - gamma.

Then, m = tan(beta) = tan(157° - gamma)

Also, from the earlier equation:

tan(23°) = |(m + k)/(1 - km)|

Substituting m = tan(157° - gamma) and k = tan(gamma):

tan(23°) = |[tan(157° - gamma) + tan(gamma)] / [1 - tan(157° - gamma) * tan(gamma)]|

Notice that the numerator and denominator resemble the tangent addition formula:

tan(A + B) = [tan A + tan B]/[1 - tan A tan B]

But here, we have tan(157° - gamma) + tan(gamma) over 1 - tan(157° - gamma) tan(gamma), which resembles tan[(157° - gamma) + gamma] = tan(157°).

Wait, exactly! So:

[tan(157° - gamma) + tan(gamma)] / [1 - tan(157° - gamma) * tan(gamma)] = tan[(157° - gamma) + gamma] = tan(157°)

Therefore, the expression becomes:

tan(23°) = |tan(157°)|

But tan(157°) = tan(180° - 23°) = -tan(23°)

So |tan(157°)| = | -tan(23°) | = tan(23°)

Thus, we have:

tan(23°) = tan(23°)

Which is an identity. So this shows that our assumption leads to an identity, meaning our previous steps are consistent, but it doesn't give us new information. Hence, we need another approach to find m.

But since we have shown that the relationship holds for any k and m satisfying alpha + beta = 157°, it suggests that angle 1, which is arctan(1/m), is related to beta.

Wait, earlier we said that angle HCE = arctan(1/m) = angle 1.

But beta is the angle between DG and AC, which is arctan(m). So if beta = arctan(m), then 1/m = cot(beta) = tan(90° - beta).

But angle 1 = arctan(1/m) = 90° - beta.

But beta = 157° - alpha, and alpha = arctan(k). But how does this help?

Wait, let's recap:

beta = arctan(m)

angle 1 = arctan(1/m) = 90° - beta

So angle 1 = 90° - beta

But beta = 157° - alpha

So angle 1 = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°

But alpha = arctan(k), and k = b/a, which is some positive number.

However, without additional constraints, we can't determine k. But perhaps there's another relationship involving alpha?

Let me think about the angle at C, which is 90°. In our coordinate system, angle at C is between BC and AC, which are the y-axis and x-axis, hence 90°. But what about other angles?

Wait, line BH is the y-axis (since B is at (0,b) and C is at (0,0)), and point H is on BH. So line BH is the y-axis. What about line CE? It is part of FE, which has slope m. So line CE goes from C(0,0) to E on FE (y = mx). So the angle between BH (y-axis) and CE is angle HCE, which is angle 1.

Earlier, we said angle HCE = arctan(1/m). Let me verify this again.

Vector CH is along the y-axis (from C to H), and vector CE is from C(0,0) to E(t, mt). The angle between CH (vertical) and CE is phi, where tan(phi) = (horizontal component)/(vertical component) = t / mt = 1/m. So phi = arctan(1/m). Hence, angle HCE = phi = arctan(1/m) = angle 1.

But from earlier, angle 1 = alpha - 67°, and alpha = arctan(k). So:

angle 1 = arctan(k) - 67°

But we need to find angle 1. However, without knowing k, we can't proceed numerically. But perhaps there's a way to relate k to other parts of the diagram?

Wait, point A is on line DG and line BI. Line BI has slope -k, and line DG has slope m. We also have the relationship that alpha + beta = 157°, where alpha = arctan(k), beta = arctan(m). And angle 1 = arctan(1/m) = 90° - beta.

So angle 1 = 90° - beta = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°.

But alpha = arctan(k), so angle 1 = arctan(k) - 67°.

But we need to find angle 1. Without knowing k, this seems stuck. However, perhaps there's a property I'm missing.

Wait, what if we consider that line AC is horizontal, and line FE is parallel to DG. Also, line AC intersects FE at C and DG at A. So the distance between FE and DG is the same along AC. But since AC is horizontal, and FE and DG are parallel, the vertical distance between them is constant.

The vertical distance between FE (y = mx) and DG (y = m(x - a)) is the difference in y-intercepts. For a fixed x, the distance between the lines is |0 - (-ma)| / sqrt(1 + m²) = |ma| / sqrt(1 + m²). But not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, since line AC is horizontal, and point A is on DG, and point C is on FE, maybe there's a relationship between the slopes?

Wait, let me think differently. Since angle 1 = arctan(1/m), and we want to find angle 1. If we can find m, we can find angle 1.

But how? Let's think about the total angles around point A.

At point A, we have angle IAG = 157°, which is between lines AI and AG. Also, line AC is horizontal, and line AI is part of BI, which has slope -k, and line AG is part of DG, which has slope m.

The angle between BI and AC is alpha = arctan(k), and the angle between DG and AC is beta = arctan(m). The total angle between BI and DG is alpha + beta = 157°, as previously established.

So alpha + beta = 157°, and angle 1 = 90° - beta.

But we need to find angle 1. Let me express beta in terms of alpha: beta = 157° - alpha.

So angle 1 = 90° - beta = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°.

But alpha = arctan(k). So angle 1 = arctan(k) - 67°.

But we need another equation to relate alpha and k. Is there any other constraint?

Wait, what about the right angle at C? In our coordinate system, angle BCA is 90°, which is already accounted for. Is there anything about line BH or other lines?

Line BH is the y-axis, and point H is on it. Line CE is part of FE, which has slope m. Is there any relation between line BH and line CE?

Not directly, unless there's a specific condition. Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle or something involving H and other points.

Alternatively, since angle HCE is angle 1, and we have angle 1 = alpha - 67°, and alpha is arctan(k). If we can find alpha, we can find angle 1.

But how?

Wait, let me think about the entire diagram. We have multiple lines and points, but no specific lengths or other angles. It seems like there's insufficient information unless there's a hidden relationship.

Wait, but maybe the answer is determined uniquely despite the variables. Let me think: angle 1 = alpha - 67°, and alpha = arctan(k). But alpha is the angle between BI and AC, which is arctan(k). However, k = b/a, and since B is at (0,b) and A is at (a,0), this is the slope of BI.

But there's no restriction on k, so theoretically, alpha could be any value, making angle 1 vary. However, the answer choices are fixed: 90, 113, 123, 157. So perhaps there's a standard value or a way to deduce it.

Wait, let's assume that alpha is 90° - 67° = 23°, making angle 1 = 0°, which doesn't make sense. Or maybe alpha is 90°, making angle 1 = 90° - 67° = 23°, but 23° is not among the choices.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle 1 is supplementary to some angle.

Wait, since angle IAG is 157°, and angle 1 is related to the slope m. Let me think: if angle 1 is 123°, then 180° - 123° = 57°, which might relate to other angles. Or if angle 1 is 113°, then 180° - 113° = 67°, which might be related to alpha.

Wait, let's suppose that angle 1 = 123°. Then, from angle 1 = alpha - 67°, we have 123° = alpha - 67° → alpha = 190°, which is impossible since alpha is an angle between two lines, so it must be between 0° and 180°.

Alternatively, if angle 1 = 113°, then alpha = 113° + 67° = 180°, which implies alpha = 180°, which means line BI is parallel to AC, but BI has slope -k and AC is horizontal. So -k = 0 → k = 0, which would mean B is at (0,0), but C is at (0,0), which is invalid.

If angle 1 = 90°, then alpha = 90° + 67° = 157°, which would imply that alpha = 157°, which would mean line BI is almost vertical, but this seems arbitrary.

If angle 1 = 157°, then alpha = 157° + 67° = 224°, which is invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to fit. Maybe my earlier assumption that angle 1 = alpha - 67° is incorrect.

Let me re-examine the relationship between angle 1 and alpha.

Earlier, I said that angle 1 = 90° - beta, where beta = arctan(m). And beta = 157° - alpha.

So angle 1 = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°.

But alpha is the angle between BI and AC, which is arctan(k), and k = b/a.

But if there's no constraint on k, how can we determine angle 1?

Wait, maybe there's a different way to relate angle 1 to other angles. Let me think about the diagram again.

Since FE || DG, and line AC intersects both, forming angles at C and A. Also, angle at C is 90°, and angle HCE is angle 1.

Wait, at point C, line FE (which is parallel to DG) and line BH (which contains C). The angle between FE and BH at C is angle HCE, which is angle 1.

Wait, no: angle HCE is at point C, between H and E. Since H is on BH and E is on FE. So line CH is part of BH, and line CE is part of FE. So the angle between BH and FE at C is angle HCE, which is angle 1.

Ah! So angle HCE is the angle between BH and FE at point C. Since FE is parallel to DG, and BH is a line passing through C.

So the angle between BH and FE at C is angle HCE = angle 1.

But since FE || DG, the angle between BH and FE is equal to the angle between BH and DG, due to parallel lines.

Wait, no. The angle between BH and FE at C is equal to the angle between BH and DG at some other point, but not necessarily at C.

Wait, if FE || DG, then the angle between BH and FE at C is equal to the angle between BH and DG at a point where BH intersects DG.

But where does BH intersect DG? Line BH is the y-axis, and line DG is y = m(x - a). Solving for intersection: y = m(x - a) and x = 0 (since BH is y-axis). Substituting x=0 into DG equation: y = m(-a) = -am. So the intersection point is (0, -am).

Thus, the angle between BH (y-axis) and DG at (0, -am) is equal to the angle between BH and FE at C, because of parallel lines.

But what is this angle?

At point C(0,0), the angle between BH (y-axis) and FE (slope m) is angle HCE = angle 1.

At point (0, -am), the angle between BH (y-axis) and DG (slope m) is the same as angle HCE = angle 1.

But this angle at (0, -am) is the angle between the y-axis and line DG, which has slope m. So this angle is the same as angle HCE = angle 1, which is arctan(1/m) as before.

Wait, but this brings us back to angle 1 = arctan(1/m).

But we also have from the earlier relationship: angle 1 = alpha - 67°, where alpha = arctan(k).

But how to find k?

Wait, let's consider the angle between BH (y-axis) and DG at (0, -am). This angle is angle 1 = arctan(1/m). Also, this angle is the same as the angle between BH and FE at C, which is angle 1.

But what is this angle? It is the angle between the y-axis (BH) and line FE (slope m). Which we already determined as arctan(1/m).

But this doesn't give new information.

Wait, but what is the relationship between this angle and the angle between BI and DG?

We know that the angle between BI and DG is 157°, and we have expressions involving alpha and beta.

Let me try to write angle 1 = arctan(1/m) = 90° - beta, where beta = arctan(m). So, angle 1 = 90° - beta.

But beta = arctan(m), so angle 1 = 90° - arctan(m).

But from earlier, we also have alpha + beta = 157°, where alpha = arctan(k).

But without knowing k, we can't proceed.

Wait, but what is alpha? Alpha is the angle between BI and AC, which is arctan(k). But BI is the line from B(0,b) to A(a,0), and AC is the horizontal line from A(a,0) to C(0,0). So the angle between BI and AC is indeed arctan(k), where k = b/a.

But in the absence of specific values, perhaps there's a way to relate this to the right angle at C?

Wait, in the right triangle ABC, with right angle at C, the slopes of BC and AC are perpendicular. BC is vertical (from B(0,b) to C(0,0)), and AC is horizontal (from A(a,0) to C(0,0)). So this is consistent.

But how does this help us?

Maybe there's a way to relate k to the angle between BI and AC. But without additional info, it's not clear.

Wait, perhaps there's a maximum or minimum value for angle 1? Or maybe the answer is derived from the given choices.

Let me think about possible values. The given choices are 90, 113, 123, 157.

We know that angle IAG is 157°, which is very large. If angle 1 is 157°, that would mean it's the same as angle IAG, but likely not. If angle 1 is 123°, then 180° - 123° = 57°, which might relate to other angles. Or 180° - 157° = 23°, which we saw earlier.

Wait, let me think: if angle 1 = 180° - 157° = 23°, but 23° is not an option. Or if angle 1 is 180° - 23° = 157°, which is an option. But that would mean angle 1 = 157°, but angle IAG is also 157°, which might suggest they are equal, but not necessarily.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is supplementary to angle IAG, then 180° - 157° = 23°, but again not an option. Or if angle 1 is related to the complement of 23°, which is 67°, but 67° is not an option.

Wait, let me revisit the earlier equation: angle 1 = alpha - 67°, and alpha is arctan(k). If I assume that alpha is 90°, then angle 1 = 90° - 67° = 23°. But 23° is not an option. If alpha is 157°, then angle 1 = 157° - 67° = 90°, which is option A. If alpha is 123°, then angle 1 = 123° - 67° = 56°, not an option. If alpha is 113°, then angle 1 = 46°. Still not matching.

Wait, but if angle 1 = 90°, then it's option A. But why would alpha be 157°? Because alpha = arctan(k), and if alpha is 157°, then k = tan(157°) = tan(180° - 23°) = -tan(23°). But k = b/a is positive, since b and a are lengths. So alpha cannot be 157°, as it would require k to be negative. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, if angle 1 = 123°, then from angle 1 = alpha - 67°, alpha = 123° + 67° = 190°, which is invalid.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. Let me re-express angle 1.

Earlier, I said angle 1 = 90° - beta, where beta = arctan(m). But beta is the angle between DG and AC, which is arctan(m). So angle 1 = 90° - arctan(m).

But also, from alpha + beta = 157°, where alpha = arctan(k). So, beta = 157° - alpha.

Substitute into angle 1 = 90° - beta = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°.

So, angle 1 = alpha - 67°.

But alpha is arctan(k), and k is positive, so alpha is between 0° and 90°. So angle 1 = alpha - 67°. For angle 1 to be positive, alpha must be > 67°. So alpha ∈ (67°, 90°).

Now, let's consider possible values for alpha. If alpha is 90°, then angle 1 = 90° - 67° = 23°. If alpha is 80°, angle 1 = 13°. If alpha is 70°, angle 1 = 3°. None of these are in the answer choices.

But wait, the answer choices include 113°, 123°, etc. Let me think if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, if angle 1 = alpha - 67°, and alpha is between 67° and 90°, then angle 1 is between 0° and 23°. But none of the answer choices are in this range. This suggests a mistake in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Let me go back. I said that angle HCE = arctan(1/m). Let me recheck this.

Vector CH is along the y-axis (from C(0,0) to H on y-axis). Vector CE is from C(0,0) to E on FE, which has slope m. So the angle between CH (y-axis) and CE is the angle whose tangent is (horizontal change)/(vertical change) = x-coordinate of E / y-coordinate of E = (t)/mt = 1/m. So the angle between CH and CE is arctan(1/m). So angle HCE = arctan(1/m) = angle 1.

But earlier, I also said that angle 1 = alpha - 67°, where alpha = arctan(k). But if alpha = arctan(k), and beta = arctan(m), and alpha + beta = 157°, then:

alpha = 157° - beta

So, angle 1 = arctan(1/m) = arctan(1/tan(beta)) = arctan(cot(beta)) = 90° - beta.

So, angle 1 = 90° - beta = 90° - (157° - alpha) = alpha - 67°.

But alpha = arctan(k), and k is positive. So angle 1 = arctan(k) - 67°. But this implies that angle 1 is dependent on k, which is unknown. However, the answer must be one of the given choices.

This suggests that there's an error in the assumptions. Let me try a different approach.

Since angle IAG is 157°, and it's at point A, between lines AI and AG. These lines are part of BI and DG, which are not parallel. The angle between them is 157°, which is very large, suggesting that the lines are almost in a straight line, but slightly diverging.

Since FE || DG, and FE passes through C, which is part of the right angle at C. Let me consider that the angle between FE and BG (or some other line) might relate to angle 1.

Alternatively, since FE || DG, and line AC intersects both, and creates angles at C and A. At point C, the angle between FE and AC is arctan(m), and at point A, the angle between DG and AC is also arctan(m). The angle between BI and AC is alpha = arctan(k), and the angle between BI and DG is 157°, which is alpha + beta = 157°.

If I assume that the angle between BI and AC is 67°, then alpha = 67°, and beta = 157° - 67° = 90°. Then, angle 1 = 90° - beta = 0°, which is impossible. Or if beta = 90°, then m is infinity, meaning DG is vertical. If DG is vertical, then FE is also vertical, so line FE is vertical, passing through C(0,0). So FE is the y-axis. But line FE is supposed to pass through C(0,0) and E. If FE is the y-axis, then point E is on the y-axis. But line BH is also the y-axis, so E and H are on the same line, which is BH. So point E is on line BH and FE (which is BH), so E is on BH. But this would make angle HCE = 0°, which is not possible.

Alternatively, if beta = 67°, then angle 1 = 90° - 67° = 23°, but again not an option.

Wait, but what if beta = 23°? Then angle 1 = 90° - 23° = 67°. Still not an option.

Wait, but if angle 1 is 123°, then 180° - 123° = 57°, which might relate to other angles. Let me think: if angle 1 = 123°, then 180° - 123° = 57°, and 157° - 57° = 100°, which might be alpha. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, let me consider that angle IAG = 157°, and angle 1 is supplementary to some angle. For example, if angle 1 + 157° = 180°, then angle 1 = 23°, not an option. Or if angle 1 is part of a triangle with 157°, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Given that the answer choices are 90, 113, 123, 157, and the most plausible logical step is that angle 1 is supplementary to the angle between BI and DG, which is 157°, giving 180° - 157° = 23°, but this isn't an option. Alternatively, if angle 1 is the supplement of the acute angle between BI and DG, which is 23°, then angle 1 = 180° - 23° = 157°, which is option D. But why would it be supplementary?

Wait, if the angle between BI and DG is 157°, then the acute angle between them is 23°, and if angle 1 is this acute angle, it would be 23°, but not an option. Or if angle 1 is 180° - 23° = 157°, which is option D. But why would angle 1 be 157°?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the same as angle IAG, which is 157°, then it would be option D. But this assumes they are equal, which may not be justified.

However, given the lack of other clues, and the presence of 157° as an option, and the possibility that angle 1 is supplementary to the acute angle between BI and DG, it might be that angle 1 is 157°. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle 1 is the exterior angle at C, related to the other angles. For example, in triangle HCE, angle at C is 1, and if other angles are known...

But without knowing other angles in the triangle, this is difficult.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might need to make an educated guess. The given choices are 90, 113, 123, 157. Since angle IAG is 157°, and angle 1 is related to it through parallel lines and transversals, it's possible that angle 1 is 180° - 157° = 23°, but this is not an option. Alternatively, if there's a triangle where 157° is an external angle, then angle 1 could be 180° - 157° = 23°, but again not an option.

Wait, but maybe angle 1 is 180° - 157° + 90° = 113°? Let me see: 180° - 157° = 23°, and 23° + 90° = 113°. This is a stretch, but 113° is option B. This might be the intended answer.

Alternatively, if the angle between FE and BH at C is 157°, and since FE || DG, the angle between DG and BH at the intersection point is also 157°, but this might relate to angle 1.

But this is too vague. Given the options, and the presence of 157° as an option, and the possibility that angle 1 is 157°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think: if angle IAG is 157°, and it's at point A, and angle 1 is at point C. Since FE || DG, and AC is a transversal, the corresponding angles might be equal. But I don't see a direct correspondence.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is equal to the angle between FE and BI, but I don't know.

Given that I'm stuck, and the answer choices, and considering that 157° is one of the options, and the angle IAG is 157°, it's possible that angle 1 is also 157°, making the answer D. But this is a shot in the dark.

Alternatively, since angle at C is 90°, and angle HCE is angle 1, and if there's a right triangle involved, maybe angle 1 is 90°, but this is option A.

But without concrete reasoning, it's hard to decide. However, given that in the calculation, angle 1 = 90° - beta, and beta = 157° - alpha, and alpha is some angle, if we assume that alpha is 90°, then beta = 157° - 90° = 67°, and angle 1 =
