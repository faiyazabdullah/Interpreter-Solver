MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the value of x given that triangles LMN and QRS are congruent. Let me start by recalling what triangle congruence means. If two triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides and angles are equal. So, the order of the letters matters here. The notation △LMN ≅ △QRS means that vertex L corresponds to Q, M to R, and N to S. Therefore, the sides opposite these vertices should be equal, and the angles as well.

First, let's note down the given information:

1. Measure of angle at L (Angle L, M, N) is equal to y + 10 degrees.
2. Length of line QR is 3x - 9.
3. Length of line ML is 2x + 11.
4. Measure of angle at R (Angle S, R, Q) is 2y - 40 degrees.

Wait, hold on. The angle measure for Angle(S, R, Q) – that would be angle at R? Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(S, R, Q) is angle at R between points S and Q. But since the triangles are congruent, maybe we can relate angles?

Let me think again. Since △LMN ≅ △QRS, then the corresponding angles should be equal. Let me map the correspondence properly. In triangle LMN, the vertices are L, M, N. In triangle QRS, they are Q, R, S. So the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S. Therefore:

- Angle at L in △LMN corresponds to angle at Q in △QRS.
- Angle at M corresponds to angle at R.
- Angle at N corresponds to angle at S.

But wait, the given angles are:

Measure of Angle(L, M, N): That's angle at M in triangle LMN, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. Wait no! Wait, Angle(L, M, N) is the angle at point M, between points L and N. So that's angle M in triangle LMN. Similarly, Angle(S, R, Q) is angle at R between S and Q, which is angle R in triangle QRS. 

So, since △LMN ≅ △QRS, their corresponding angles are equal. So angle M in LMN equals angle R in QRS. Also, angle L in LMN equals angle Q in QRS, and angle N in LMN equals angle S in QRS.

Given that, let's look at the given equations:

First equation: Measure of Angle(L, M, N) = y + 10. This is angle M in LMN. Which corresponds to angle R in QRS. However, there's another given angle: Measure of Angle(S, R, Q) = 2y - 40. That's angle at R in QRS. Therefore, since angle M (in LMN) corresponds to angle R (in QRS), then angle M (which is y + 10) equals angle R (which is 2y - 40). Therefore:

y + 10 = 2y - 40

Solving this:

Subtract y from both sides: 10 = y - 40 → y = 50.

So y is 50. Got that.

Now, moving on to the lengths. The given lengths are:

Length of line QR is 3x - 9. QR is a side in triangle QRS. Since △LMN ≅ △QRS, their corresponding sides are equal. Let's figure out which sides correspond. 

In triangle LMN, the sides are LM, MN, NL. In triangle QRS, the sides are QR, RS, SQ. Since the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S, then:

Side LM in LMN corresponds to side QR in QRS. Because L→Q and M→R, so LM corresponds to QR. Therefore, length LM equals length QR. 

The length of LM is given as 2x + 11, and length QR is 3x - 9. Therefore, setting them equal:

2x + 11 = 3x - 9

Solving:

Subtract 2x from both sides: 11 = x - 9 → x = 20.

Therefore, x is 20. Let me check if there are other equations to consider. Are there more constraints?

Also, perhaps check if other sides or angles could give us another equation? For example, maybe other angles or other sides?

We have found y=50 and x=20. Let me verify if that makes sense. Let me check angles again. 

Angle M in LMN was y + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 degrees. Then angle R in QRS is 2y -40 = 2*50 -40 = 100 -40 = 60 degrees. So that matches. Good.

Now, checking the sides. LM is 2x +11 when x=20: 2*20 +11 = 40 +11 = 51. QR is 3x -9 = 3*20 -9 = 60 -9 = 51. So that checks out.

Are there other sides? For example, maybe other sides like MN and RS, or NL and SQ? But since the problem only gives us one equation for the sides (the length of QR and LM), but since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding sides must be equal. However, unless there are more given equations, we don't have more info. So our calculation of x=20 seems valid.

But let me make sure there isn't something else. For instance, maybe the angles at other vertices? Let me see. Suppose we had more angles given, but in the problem, only those two angles were given. So with the given info, solving for y first using the angles, then solving for x using the sides. Seems solid.

Therefore, the answer should be x=20, which is option B.

Wait, the answer choices are A.10, B.20, C.40, D.50. So B is 20. Hence, Final Answer: B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ given that $ \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS $, we apply the **properties of congruent triangles**. Specifically, in congruent triangles, corresponding parts are equal—this includes corresponding angles and corresponding sides.

---

### Step 1: Understand Corresponding Parts

From the congruence $ \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS $, the correspondence is:

- Vertex $ L \leftrightarrow Q $
- Vertex $ M \leftrightarrow R $
- Vertex $ N \leftrightarrow S $

This implies:

- Side $ LM \leftrightarrow QR $
- Side $ MN \leftrightarrow RS $
- Side $ NL \leftrightarrow SQ $
- $ \angle L \leftrightarrow \angle Q $
- $ \angle M \leftrightarrow \angle R $
- $ \angle N \leftrightarrow \angle S $

---

### Step 2: Use Given Angle Information

We are told:

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle L, M, N = y + 10
$$
This represents $ \angle M $ in $ \triangle LMN $, which corresponds to $ \angle R $ in $ \triangle QRS $.  
Also:

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle S, R, Q = 2y - 40
$$
This represents $ \angle R $ in $ \triangle QRS $, so it must be equal to $ \angle M $ in $ \triangle LMN $.

Set up the equation:

$$
y + 10 = 2y - 40
$$

Solve:

$$
y = 50
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Given Side Information

We are also told:

$$
\text{Length of } \overline{QR} = 3x - 9
$$
and

$$
\text{Length of } \overline{ML} = 2x + 11
$$

Since $ \overline{ML} \leftrightarrow \overline{QR} $, these segments are congruent:

$$
2x + 11 = 3x - 9
$$

Solve:

$$
11 + 9 = x \Rightarrow x = 20
$$

---

### Step 4: Verify Consistency

Check the values:

- $ y = 50 $
- $ x = 20 $

Verify angle equality:

- $ \angle M = y + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60^\circ $
- $ \angle R = 2y - 40 = 2(50) - 40 = 60^\circ $

So angles match.

Check side equality:

- $ \overline{ML} = 2x + 11 = 2(20) + 11 = 51 $
- $ \overline{QR} = 3x - 9 = 3(20) - 9 = 51 $

Sides match.

All conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
