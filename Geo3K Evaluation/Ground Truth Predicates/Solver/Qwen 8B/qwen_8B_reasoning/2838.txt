MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given geometric constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. The question asks for PR, given some lengths and parallel lines. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

The points mentioned are Q, N, M, K, L, P, R. There are several line relationships:

1. Point Q lies on line NM.
2. Point P lies on line MK.
3. Point R lies on line ML.
4. Point N lies on line KL.
5. Point Q lies on line PR.
6. Line NK is perpendicular to line NM.
7. Line ML is perpendicular to line MK.

Also, we have that PR is parallel to KL. Additionally, KN = 9, LN = 16, and PM = 2 KP. We need to find PR.

First, maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw here, I'll try to visualize it based on the constraints.

Let me note down coordinates for easier calculation. Maybe coordinate geometry could be useful here. Let's assign coordinates to some points. Since there are perpendicular lines, perhaps using right angles and coordinates might simplify things.

Starting with the perpendicularity conditions. The first condition says that line NK is perpendicular to line NM. So, if I consider point N as the origin, maybe? Wait, but I need to set up coordinates properly.

Alternatively, since there are multiple perpendicular lines, perhaps setting up coordinate axes along these lines.

Let me think. Let's assume that line NM is horizontal because it's perpendicular to NK. If line NK is vertical (since it's perpendicular to NM). Alternatively, depending on how we orient the figure.

Wait, let's take point N as the origin. Let me try to assign coordinates.

Let me place point N at (0, 0). Then, since line NM is such that NK is perpendicular to it. Let me suppose line NM is horizontal. Therefore, line NK would be vertical. So, point K would lie somewhere along the y-axis if line NK is vertical. But wait, line NK is perpendicular to line NM, so if NM is horizontal, then NK is vertical.

So, let me define:

- Let’s take N at (0, 0).
- Since line NM is horizontal, let me assume M is along the x-axis. Let me say M has coordinates (a, 0) for some a.
- Since line NK is perpendicular to NM (which is horizontal), then line NK is vertical. Therefore, point K is along the y-axis. So, coordinates of K would be (0, b) for some b.

But also, there's another condition: point N lies on line KL. So, point N (which is at (0,0)) lies on line KL. Therefore, line KL passes through N(0,0).

Additionally, point R lies on line ML. Let me see. Also, point R lies on line ML. Let me try to get coordinates for these points.

Given that LN = 16. Wait, LN is given as 16. Since N is at (0,0), and L is some point. Let me find coordinates for L.

But first, let's process the given lengths: KN = 9 and LN = 16. KN is the length from K to N. Since N is at (0,0), and K is at (0, b), then distance KN is |b|. Given that KN=9, so b=9 or -9. Assuming standard orientation, let's take b positive, so K is at (0,9). Therefore, coordinates of K: (0,9).

Now, point N is (0,0), K is (0,9). Now, line KL passes through N. So line KL connects points K(0,9) and L, passing through N(0,0). Therefore, line KL is the line connecting K(0,9) and L, which passes through N(0,0). That suggests that line KL is the same line as the y-axis? Because both K and N are on the y-axis. Wait, but point L is also on line KL. So if line KL is the y-axis, then L is another point on the y-axis. However, point L is connected to M via line ML. Also, point R lies on line ML. Let me check.

Wait, point R lies on line ML. Also, point L is on line KL, which is the y-axis. So point L is on the y-axis. Therefore, coordinates of L are (0, c) for some c. But since N is on line KL, which is the line from K(0,9) to L(0,c). Wait, but if both K and L are on the y-axis, then line KL is the y-axis itself. Hence, point N(0,0) is on line KL. That works. So coordinates of L must be (0, something). Let me denote L as (0, l). Since KN is from (0,9) to (0,0), which is length 9, which matches KN=9. Then LN is the distance between L(0,l) and N(0,0), which is |l|. Given that LN=16, so |l|=16. Therefore, l=16 or l=-16. Let me assume l is positive, so L is (0,16). Therefore, coordinates:

N: (0,0)
K: (0,9)
L: (0,16)

Therefore, line KL is the vertical line x=0 (y-axis), passing through K(0,9), N(0,0), and L(0,16).

Now, moving on. Next, point M is on the x-axis, as per earlier assumption. Let me denote M as (m, 0). Wait, earlier I considered M as (a,0), but let me use m for simplicity. So M is (m, 0). Now, point P lies on line MK. Line MK connects M(m,0) to K(0,9). Let me parametrize that line. The parametric equations for line MK can be written as follows:

From M(m,0) to K(0,9). The vector from M to K is (-m, 9). So parametric equations for line MK can be expressed as:

x = m - mt, 
y = 0 + 9t,

where t ranges from 0 to 1 for the segment MK, but since P is a point on line MK, t can be any real number.

Similarly, point R lies on line ML. Line ML connects M(m,0) to L(0,16). Let me parametrize that line as well. The vector from M to L is (-m, 16). So parametric equations:

x = m - ms,
y = 0 + 16s,

for parameter s.

Now, there's another condition: line ML is perpendicular to line MK. Wait, the problem states Perpendicular(Line(M, L), Line(M, K)). So line ML is perpendicular to line MK. Let me verify that. The slope of MK is (9 - 0)/(0 - m) = 9/(-m) = -9/m. The slope of ML is (16 - 0)/(0 - m) = 16/(-m) = -16/m. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So:

(-9/m) * (-16/m) = (144)/m². This should equal -1?

Wait, no! Wait, that can't be. If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. But according to our calculation, the product is positive 144/m². Which would only be -1 if 144/m² = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means my assumption about the coordinates may be wrong.

Wait, hold on. What did I do wrong here? Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says:

Perpendicular(Line(M, L), Line(M, K)).

Wait, so line ML is perpendicular to line MK. Wait, but in my setup, line ML is from M to L, and line MK is from M to K. Therefore, those two lines originate from the same point M, so they are two lines starting at M, going to L and K respectively. So the angle between them is determined by their slopes. But according to the previous calculation, their slopes are -16/m and -9/m, leading to a product of positive 144/m². Which cannot be negative. Therefore, unless my coordinate system is incorrect.

Hmm. Where is the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in assigning coordinates. Let me check again.

Earlier, I assumed that line NM is horizontal (so NM is along x-axis), and line NK is vertical (perpendicular to NM). Therefore, line NK is vertical, hence K is on the y-axis. Then line ML is supposed to be perpendicular to line MK. But according to my current coordinates, line ML and MK share the same starting point M, and their slopes are -16/m and -9/m. Their product is positive, so they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption about the coordinate system is flawed.

Alternative approach: Perhaps I misassigned the direction of the lines. Let me reconsider the perpendicularity.

The problem says: Perpendicular(Line(M, L), Line(M, K)). So the lines ML and MK are perpendicular. Therefore, vectors ML and MK are perpendicular. So the vectors from M to L and from M to K are perpendicular. Therefore, their dot product is zero.

Vector ML is L - M = (0 - m, 16 - 0) = (-m, 16)

Vector MK is K - M = (0 - m, 9 - 0) = (-m, 9)

Dot product of ML and MK is (-m)(-m) + (16)(9) = m² + 144. For them to be perpendicular, this must be zero. Therefore:

m² + 144 = 0 → m² = -144 → which is impossible in real numbers. Contradiction again.

This implies that there's a fundamental flaw in my coordinate assignments. Therefore, my initial assumptions about the positions of points must be incorrect. Let me rethink.

Perhaps line NM isn't horizontal? Or maybe my assignment of coordinates for points is wrong. Let me try another approach.

Let me recall that the problem includes multiple points lying on certain lines, and several perpendicularity conditions. Maybe I need to use more general coordinate assignments without assuming specific directions.

Let me try again, more carefully.

Start with point N. Let me consider line NM and line NK being perpendicular. Let me assign coordinates with N at the origin (0,0). Let me take line NM as the x-axis, so point M is somewhere on the x-axis, say (a, 0). Since line NK is perpendicular to NM, which is along x-axis, so line NK is vertical. Therefore, point K is along the y-axis, say (0, b). 

Then, line KL passes through N(0,0). So line KL connects points K(0,b) and L, passing through N(0,0). Therefore, line KL is the line joining K(0,b) and L, passing through N(0,0). Therefore, L must be colinear with K and N. So points K, N, L are colinear, with N between K and L or vice versa. Given that LN = 16. Since N is between K and L, then LN is part of the line KL. Let me calculate coordinates for L.

Since K is at (0, b), N is at (0,0), and L is on line KN extended beyond N. Suppose L is on the extension of KN beyond N. Then, vector from K to N is (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b). Extending past N, point L would be further along that line. Let me parametrize this line. Parametric equation for line KL (which is the y-axis) can be represented as (0, t), where t varies. Points K is at (0, b), N is at (0, 0), and L is at (0, l). The distance from N to L is |l - 0| = |l| = 16, so l = ±16. Assuming the direction, let me take l = -16, meaning L is below N. Therefore, coordinates of L would be (0, -16). Wait, but then KN is from K(0, b) to N(0,0), which has length |b - 0| = |b|. Given that KN = 9, so |b| = 9. Let me take b = 9, so K is at (0,9), N at (0,0), L at (0,-16). So line KL goes from (0,9) through (0,0) to (0,-16). Thus, LN is from L(0,-16) to N(0,0): length is 16 units, which matches.

So now, points:

N: (0, 0)

K: (0, 9)

L: (0, -16)

M: (a, 0) for some a.

Now, line ML connects M(a, 0) to L(0, -16). And line MK connects M(a,0) to K(0,9). These two lines are supposed to be perpendicular. So vectors ML and MK should be perpendicular.

Compute vectors:

ML: L - M = (0 - a, -16 - 0) = (-a, -16)

MK: K - M = (0 - a, 9 - 0) = (-a, 9)

Their dot product should be zero:

(-a)(-a) + (-16)(9) = a² - 144 = 0 ⇒ a² = 144 ⇒ a = 12 or -12. Let's take a = 12 for simplicity. So M is at (12, 0).

Thus, coordinates:

M: (12, 0)

Now, point P lies on line MK. Let me parametrize line MK. From M(12, 0) to K(0, 9). The parametric equations can be written as:

x = 12 - 12t

y = 0 + 9t

Where t ∈ [0,1] gives the segment MK, but P can be anywhere on the line. Similarly, point R lies on line ML. Line ML connects M(12,0) to L(0,-16). Parametric equations for ML:

x = 12 - 12s

y = 0 - 16s

Again, s ∈ [0,1] for the segment ML.

Additionally, point Q lies on line NM (from N(0,0) to M(12,0)), which is the x-axis. Also, point Q lies on line PR. 

Moreover, PR || KL. Let me recall that KL is the line from K(0,9) to L(0,-16), which is the vertical line x=0. Wait, KL is vertical. Therefore, if PR is parallel to KL, then PR must also be vertical. Therefore, PR is a vertical line. 

So PR is vertical. That means that points P and R have the same x-coordinate. Therefore, if PR is vertical, then the x-coordinates of P and R are equal. 

Let me denote coordinates of P and R. Let me express P as a point on line MK and R as a point on line ML.

Let me write parametric expressions for P and R.

For point P on line MK:

Parametric form: x_P = 12 - 12t, y_P = 9t.

For point R on line ML:

Parametric form: x_R = 12 - 12s, y_R = -16s.

Since PR is vertical, x_P = x_R. Therefore:

12 - 12t = 12 - 12s ⇒ -12t = -12s ⇒ t = s.

So parameters t and s are equal. Let me denote t = s = k. So, coordinates:

P: (12 - 12k, 9k)

R: (12 - 12k, -16k)

Therefore, PR is the vertical segment from (12 - 12k, 9k) to (12 - 12k, -16k). The length of PR is the difference in y-coordinates:

PR_length = |9k - (-16k)| = |25k| = 25|k|.

We need to find PR_length, which depends on k. To find k, we need more constraints. 

Another constraint is that point Q lies on line PR and also on line NM (which is the x-axis). Let me explore that.

Point Q is on line NM (the x-axis), so its coordinates are (q, 0) for some q. Also, Q lies on line PR. Since PR is vertical line x = 12 - 12k, and Q is on the x-axis (y=0), the intersection point Q is where the vertical line PR meets the x-axis. Therefore, substituting y=0 into the equation of PR.

The vertical line PR has x = 12 - 12k. At y=0, the point Q is (12 - 12k, 0). Therefore, Q is located at (12 - 12k, 0). 

But also, point Q lies on line NM. Since line NM is from N(0,0) to M(12,0), which is the x-axis. Therefore, Q is on the x-axis, which matches our previous conclusion. 

However, there might be additional constraints. Are there any others? Let me check the given conditions again. 

The problem mentions that PM = 2 KP. Let me interpret this. PM is the length from P to M, and KP is the length from K to P. Wait, need to confirm notation. In geometry problems, sometimes segments are denoted by the letters, but here, since P is a point, PM is the segment from P to M. Similarly, KP is the segment from K to P. So PM = 2 KP. 

Let me compute PM and KP in terms of k.

Coordinates:

Point P: (12 - 12k, 9k)

Point M: (12, 0)

Distance PM: sqrt[(12 - (12 - 12k))² + (0 - 9k)^2] = sqrt[(12k)^2 + (-9k)^2] = sqrt[144k² + 81k²] = sqrt[225k²] = 15|k|

Distance KP: distance from K(0,9) to P(12 - 12k, 9k):

sqrt[(12 - 12k - 0)^2 + (9k - 9)^2]

Let me expand this:

= sqrt[(12(1 - k))^2 + 9(k - 1)^2]

Factor out (1 - k)^2:

Note that 12^2 = 144, and 9^2 = 81. So:

= sqrt[ (144)(1 - k)^2 + 81(1 - k)^2 ] = sqrt[ (144 + 81)(1 - k)^2 ) ] = sqrt[225(1 - k)^2] = 15|1 - k|

Therefore, PM = 15|k| and KP = 15|1 - k|. According to the condition PM = 2 KP:

15|k| = 2 * 15|1 - k| ⇒ |k| = 2|1 - k|

Assuming k is a scalar parameter. Let me drop the absolute values by considering cases.

Case 1: k ≥ 0 and 1 - k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 1. Then |k| = k and |1 - k| = 1 - k.

Equation becomes k = 2(1 - k) ⇒ k = 2 - 2k ⇒ 3k = 2 ⇒ k = 2/3.

Case 2: k ≥ 0 and 1 - k < 0 ⇒ k > 1. Then |k| = k and |1 - k| = k - 1.

Equation becomes k = 2(k - 1) ⇒ k = 2k - 2 ⇒ -k = -2 ⇒ k = 2.

Check validity: k=2 is allowed since k>1.

Case 3: k < 0 and 1 - k ≥ 0 ⇒ k < 0 and k ≤ 1. Here, |k| = -k, |1 - k| = 1 - k.

Equation: -k = 2(1 - k) ⇒ -k = 2 - 2k ⇒ k = 2. But k=2 contradicts k < 0. Disregard.

Case 4: k < 0 and 1 - k < 0 ⇒ k < 0 and k > 1. Impossible. Disregard.

Thus, possible solutions are k = 2/3 or k = 2.

Now, need to determine which value of k is valid. Let me check the positions of P and R.

If k = 2/3:

Coordinates of P: x = 12 - 12*(2/3) = 12 - 8 = 4; y = 9*(2/3) = 6. So P is at (4, 6).

Coordinates of R: x = 12 - 12*(2/3) = 4; y = -16*(2/3) = -32/3 ≈ -10.666...

So PR is vertical line at x=4 from y=6 to y=-32/3. Length PR = 6 - (-32/3) = 6 + 32/3 = 18/3 + 32/3 = 50/3 ≈ 16.666...

If k = 2:

Coordinates of P: x = 12 - 12*2 = 12 - 24 = -12; y = 9*2 = 18. So P is at (-12, 18).

Coordinates of R: x = 12 - 12*2 = -12; y = -16*2 = -32. So R is at (-12, -32). Length PR is 18 - (-32) = 50 units.

Now, need to check if these values make sense in the context of the problem.

First, check whether point Q exists. Earlier, we had Q at (12 - 12k, 0). For k=2/3:

Q_x = 12 - 12*(2/3) = 12 - 8 = 4. So Q is at (4, 0), which lies on line NM (the x-axis from (0,0) to (12,0)). So yes, that's okay.

For k=2:

Q_x = 12 - 12*2 = 12 - 24 = -12. So Q is at (-12, 0). Is this on line NM? Line NM is from N(0,0) to M(12,0). But point (-12, 0) is outside the segment NM, but since the problem says "PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(N, M))", which means the entire line NM, not just the segment. Therefore, Q can be anywhere on line NM, including extensions. So both possibilities are acceptable.

But we need to check if there are other constraints that might eliminate one of the solutions.

Looking back at the problem, we have other constraints involving point Q. Wait, point Q lies on line PR and on line NM. But we already used that to derive the position of Q. Are there any other constraints? Let me check.

The problem didn't mention anything else about Q except that it lies on those two lines. So both k=2/3 and k=2 seem possible. However, we need to ensure that the rest of the conditions are satisfied.

Wait, but let's check the length of PR. The question asks for PR. Depending on k, PR is either 50/3 or 50. Let me look at the answer choices:

A. 15

B. 32 / 2 = 16

C. 50/3 ≈ 16.666...

D. 17

So 50/3 is option C, and 50 is not among the choices. However, the answer choices include C as 50/3. So if k=2/3, then PR is 50/3. If k=2, PR is 50, which isn't listed. Therefore, likely k=2/3 is the correct solution. But why?

Is there a reason to discard k=2? Let me think about the position of point P. When k=2, point P is at (-12, 18). Is there any issue with that? Well, the problem didn't restrict the positions of points beyond the given constraints. However, we need to check if there are any other constraints that might affect this.

Wait, looking back, there was a condition that point R lies on line ML. For k=2, point R is at (-12, -32), which is on line ML. Let me confirm:

Line ML connects M(12,0) to L(0,-16). The parametric equations for ML were x = 12 - 12s, y = -16s. For s=2, x=12 - 24 = -12, y = -32. Yes, that's correct. So R is indeed on ML.

Same for P when k=2: P is on line MK. Let me check. Line MK connects M(12,0) to K(0,9). Parametric equations: x = 12 - 12t, y = 9t. For t=2, x=12 -24 = -12, y=18. Which is correct. So P is on line MK.

So both solutions are mathematically valid. However, since the answer choices don't include 50, but include 50/3, which corresponds to k=2/3, that suggests that k=2/3 is the intended solution. Why is that?

Possibly, there is an implicit assumption that the points are arranged in a certain way. For example, if PR is parallel to KL, which is vertical. So PR is vertical. If PR is vertical, then when k=2, PR is from (-12, 18) to (-12, -32), which is vertical. When k=2/3, PR is from (4,6) to (4, -32/3), also vertical. Both are valid.

But why does the problem give us PM = 2 KP? Let me check both scenarios:

For k=2/3:

PM = 15*(2/3) = 10

KP = 15*(1 - 2/3) = 15*(1/3) = 5

Indeed, 10 = 2*5. Correct.

For k=2:

PM = 15*2 = 30

KP = 15*(1 - 2) = 15*(-1) = |-15| = 15? Wait, earlier computation said KP = 15|1 - k|. So for k=2, |1 - k| = 1, so KP = 15*1 = 15. So PM = 30 = 2*15. Correct.

Both satisfy PM = 2 KP. So both are valid. But since the answer choices don't include 50, but include 50/3, which is approximately 16.666..., which is one of the options, then likely the correct answer is C: 50/3. However, why is there ambiguity?

Wait, maybe there's an error in interpreting PM = 2 KP. Let me double-check the notation. The problem says "PM = 2 KP". Does this mean PM = 2 times KP? Yes. So both cases satisfy that. So both answers are possible. But since the answer choices don't have 50, but have 50/3, which is C, and the other case leads to 50 which is not an option, we have to pick C.

But let me check once more if there's another constraint that I missed. Let me recall that line PR is parallel to KL. KL is the vertical line x=0. So PR must be vertical. Which both cases satisfy. So both are valid. However, in the case of k=2, point Q is at (-12, 0), which is on line NM (extended). No issues there.

But maybe the problem assumes that P and R are positioned such that PR is between certain points? Or maybe there's a unique solution based on the configuration. Wait, but how can we decide between k=2 and k=2/3?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the PR length.

Wait for k=2/3, PR length is 25k = 25*(2/3) = 50/3 ≈ 16.666...

Yes, which is option C.

For k=2, PR length is 25*2 = 50. Not in the options. Hence, the answer must be C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 50/3.

Final Answer: C

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this geometric problem, we begin by analyzing the key constraints and assigning coordinates strategically to simplify computations while preserving the geometric relationships.

### Step 1: Assign Coordinates Based on Perpendicularity and Known Lengths

We are told:

- `Perpendicular(Line(N, K), Line(N, M))`  
- `Perpendicular(Line(M, L), Line(M, K))`  
- `KN = 9`, `LN = 16`, and `PM = 2 KP`
- `PR ∥ KL`

These suggest that the triangle formed by points $ N, K, L $ and $ M $ is related through perpendicular lines and known distances. To model this, we fix point **N** at the origin $(0, 0)$.

#### Set Up Coordinate System
- Place **N** at the origin: $ N = (0, 0) $
- Since $ \overline{NK} \perp \overline{NM} $, and $ \overline{KL} \perp \overline{MK} $, we align:
  - $ \overline{NM} $ along the x-axis → $ M = (a, 0) $
  - $ \overline{NK} $ along the y-axis → $ K = (0, 9) $ (since $ KN = 9 $)
  - $ \overline{KL} $ continues through $ N $, so $ L $ lies on the y-axis too: $ L = (0, -16) $ (since $ LN = 16 $)

Now, $ \overline{ML} $ and $ \overline{MK} $ intersect at point $ M $. We compute the coordinates of $ M $ using the fact that $ \overrightarrow{ML} \cdot \overrightarrow{MK} = 0 $ (they are perpendicular).

Let $ M = (a, 0) $, so:
- $ \vec{ML} = (-a, -16) $
- $ \vec{MK} = (-a, 9) $

Their dot product:
$$
\vec{ML} \cdot \vec{MK} = a^2 - 144 = 0 \Rightarrow a^2 = 144 \Rightarrow a = 12
$$

So, final coordinates:
- $ N = (0, 0) $
- $ K = (0, 9) $
- $ L = (0, -16) $
- $ M = (12, 0) $

---

### Step 2: Determine Coordinates of Points P and R

Points $ P $ and $ R $ lie on lines $ \overline{MK} $ and $ \overline{ML} $, respectively.

#### Parametrize Lines:
- $ \overline{MK} $: from $ M(12, 0) $ to $ K(0, 9) $  
  Parametric form:  
  $$
  x = 12 - 12t,\quad y = 9t
  $$

- $ \overline{ML} $: from $ M(12, 0) $ to $ L(0, -16) $  
  Parametric form:  
  $$
  x = 12 - 12s,\quad y = -16s
  $$

Since $ PR \parallel KL $, and $ KL $ is vertical (because $ K $ and $ L $ are on the y-axis), then $ PR $ must also be vertical. Therefore, the x-coordinates of $ P $ and $ R $ must be equal.

Let’s suppose:
$$
x_P = x_R = 12 - 12k \Rightarrow t = s = k
$$

So, coordinates:
- $ P = (12 - 12k, 9k) $
- $ R = (12 - 12k, -16k) $

Length of $ PR $ is:
$$
PR = |9k - (-16k)| = |25k|
$$

### Step 3: Use Given Condition $ PM = 2 KP $

Use the coordinates of $ P $, $ K $, and $ M $ to compute distances:

- $ PM = \sqrt{(12 - (12 - 12k))^2 + (0 - 9k)^2} = \sqrt{(12k)^2 + (9k)^2} = \sqrt{225k^2} = 15|k| $
- $ KP = \sqrt{(12 - 12k - 0)^2 + (9k - 9)^2} = \sqrt{(12(1 - k))^2 + (9(k - 1))^2} = \sqrt{225(1 - k)^2} = 15|1 - k| $

Set $ PM = 2KP $:
$$
15|k| = 2 \cdot 15|1 - k| \Rightarrow |k| = 2|1 - k|
$$

Solving this yields two solutions:
- $ k = \frac{2}{3} $
- $ k = 2 $

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Case and Choose the Valid One

#### Case 1: $ k = \frac{2}{3} $
- $ PR = 25k = 25 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{50}{3} $
- This value is among the answer choices.

#### Case 2: $ k = 2 $
- $ PR = 25k = 50 $
- This value is **not** among the answer choices.

Hence, the only valid solution consistent with the given answer choices is:

$$
PR = \frac{50}{3}
$$
