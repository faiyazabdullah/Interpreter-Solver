MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 1 here. So, first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided.

We have points F, D, G, E, and maybe others. The angles mentioned are Angle(F, D, G) which equals angle 2, Angle(D, E, F) is 25 degrees, Angle(G, D, E) equals angle 1, and Angle(E, F, D) is 65 degrees. Also, point G lies on line EF, and lines GE and GD are perpendicular. Wait, Perpendicular(Line(G,E), Line(G,D))? That means that at point G, lines GE and GD form a right angle? Or wait, maybe it's saying that line GE is perpendicular to line GD? Because the notation Line(G,E) and Line(G,D) would mean two lines starting at G, so their intersection is at G. Therefore, they are perpendicular there. So angle between GE and GD is 90 degrees.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points E, F, D, G. Since Point G lies on line EF, so G is somewhere on the line connecting E and F. But also, there's another point D connected to these points. Let me think about the configuration.

Given that Angle(E,F,D) is 65 degrees. So that's angle at point F between points E, F, D. So triangle EFD? Maybe? Then angle at F is 65 degrees. Also, angle at D, E, F is 25 degrees. Wait, Angle(D, E, F) is 25 degrees. So that's angle at E between points D, E, F. So angle at E is 25 degrees. Hmm. And then Angle(G,D,E) equals angle 1. Which is angle at D between G, D, E. So angle GDE is equal to angle 1.

Also, Angle(F,D,G) equals angle 2. So angle at D between F, D, G. So angle FDG is equal to angle 2.

Additionally, lines GE and GD are perpendicular. So at point G, the lines GE and GD meet at a right angle. Since G is on line EF, then GE is part of line EF? Wait, no. If G is on line EF, then line EG is part of line EF. Wait, but the line GE is the same as line EG. So if GE is perpendicular to GD, then GD is perpendicular to EG (which is along EF). Therefore, GD is perpendicular to EF at point G. So GD is a line from D to G, forming a right angle with EF at G.

So let me try to imagine this. There's line EF, with point G somewhere on it. From point G, we draw GD such that GD is perpendicular to EF. So GD is like a vertical line if EF is horizontal. Now, there's point D connected to G and E. Also, angle at E (Angle(D,E,F)) is 25 degrees. So triangle DEF has angle at E of 25 degrees, angle at F of 65 degrees. Wait, but angle at F is given as 65 degrees. So in triangle DEF, angles at E and F are 25 and 65 degrees. Then the third angle at D would be 180 - 25 - 65 = 90 degrees. Wait, so angle at D in triangle DEF is 90 degrees?

Wait, but angle at D in triangle DEF is angle EDF. Wait, angle EDF is angle at D between E, D, F. But according to the given, Angle(F, D, G) is angle FDG, which is different. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Hold on, let's get back. In triangle DEF, angle at E is 25 degrees (given as Angle(D, E, F) is 25), angle at F is 65 degrees (given as Angle(E, F, D) is 65). Therefore, angle at D in triangle DEF is 180 - 25 - 65 = 90 degrees. So angle EDF is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle between ED and FD is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle EDF is the angle at D between E, D, F. So that's angle EDF = 90 degrees. 

But then there's another angle at D involving point G: angle FDG (Angle(F, D, G)) which is equal to angle 2. Also, angle GDE (Angle(G, D, E)) is equal to angle 1. So angle at D between G, D, E is angle GDE, which is angle 1. 

Since GD is perpendicular to EF (because GE and GD are perpendicular, and GE is part of EF since G is on EF), so GD is perpendicular to EF. Therefore, GD is perpendicular to EF, meaning GD is an altitude from D to EF. Wait, but D is connected to G, which is on EF. So GD is perpendicular to EF, making triangle DGF and DGE right triangles?

Moreover, since angle EDF is 90 degrees, as per earlier calculation, and GD is perpendicular to EF. Let me see how these relate.

Let me consider coordinates to make this easier. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point G at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since GD is perpendicular to EF, and G is on EF. Let me assume EF is horizontal. So line EF is horizontal, and GD is vertical upwards from G. Let me suppose that EF is along x-axis, with G at (0,0). Then GD is vertical, so D is somewhere along the y-axis. Wait, because GD is perpendicular to EF (x-axis), so GD is vertical. So if G is at (0,0), then D is at (0, d) for some d. 

Now, point E is on line EF. Since G is on EF, and assuming EF extends infinitely in both directions. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s say E is at (-a, 0), F is at (b, 0), and G is at (0,0). Then GD is vertical up from G(0,0) to D(0, k) for some k. Now, point D is (0,k).

Then, angle at E (Angle(D, E, F)) is 25 degrees. Let's compute that angle. So angle at E between D-E-F. So vectors ED and EF. Vector ED goes from E(-a,0) to D(0,k): (a, k). Vector EF goes from E(-a,0) to F(b,0): (b + a, 0). The angle between ED and EF is 25 degrees.

Similarly, angle at F (Angle(E, F, D)) is 65 degrees. So angle at F between E-F-D. Vectors FE and FD. FE is from F to E: (-a - b, 0). FD is from F to D: (0 - b, k - 0) = (-b, k). The angle between FE and FD is 65 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates can help us find relations between a, b, k. However, maybe there's a better way without getting into coordinates. Alternatively, since triangle DEF has angles 25°, 65°, and 90°, as previously deduced. Wait, angle at D is 90°, angle at E is 25°, angle at F is 65°, which adds up to 180°. Therefore, triangle DEF is right-angled at D. Wait, angle at D is 90°, so triangle DEF is right-angled at D. Therefore, DE is perpendicular to DF. 

But GD is perpendicular to EF. So GD is perpendicular to EF, and DE is perpendicular to DF. How do these relate?

Let me think. Since DEF is right-angled at D, then DE ⊥ DF. Also, GD is perpendicular to EF. Let me check if GD is related to DE or DF somehow. 

Since GD is perpendicular to EF, and DE and DF are sides of the right triangle DEF. Let me think if there's a relationship between GD and DE or DF. For example, maybe GD is the altitude from D to EF? Because GD is perpendicular to EF and passes through G, which is on EF. So GD is the altitude from D to EF. Therefore, in triangle DEF, GD is the altitude from D to hypotenuse EF. 

In a right-angled triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse has certain properties. Wait, but DEF is right-angled at D, so the hypotenuse is EF. Therefore, the altitude from D to EF would split the triangle into two smaller similar triangles. 

The length of the altitude h from D to EF in a right-angled triangle is given by h = (product of legs)/hypotenuse. Let me recall: in a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse is equal to (leg1 * leg2)/hypotenuse. 

But maybe I don't need exact lengths. Instead, since GD is this altitude, then the angles formed by GD with DE and DF might relate to the original angles. 

Alternatively, considering angles around point D. At point D, we have angle EDF = 90°, which is split into angle GDE (angle 1) and angle FDG (angle 2). Because GD is splitting the angle at D into two parts. So angle EDF = angle GDE + angle FDG = angle1 + angle2 = 90°. Therefore, angle1 + angle2 = 90°. 

But we need to find angle1. To find angle1, we need more info about angle2 or other relationships. Let me look for other constraints. 

Looking back at the given angles. We know angle at E (Angle(D, E, F)) is 25°, and angle at F (Angle(E, F, D)) is 65°. Also, since GD is perpendicular to EF, maybe we can use some triangle properties. 

Let me consider triangle DGE and triangle DGF. Since GD is perpendicular to EF, triangles DGE and DGF are right-angled at G. 

In triangle DGE: right-angled at G, with angle at E being 25°, so angle at D would be 90° - 25° = 65°. Wait, angle at D in triangle DGE? Wait, in triangle DGE, angles are at D, G, E. At G it's 90°, at E it's 25°, so angle at D is 65°. Similarly, in triangle DGF, right-angled at G, with angle at F being 65°, so angle at D would be 25°. 

Therefore, angle at D in triangle DGE is 65°, which is angle GDE, which is angle1. Wait, angle GDE is part of angle EDF, which was 90°, so angle1 is 65°, and angle2 would be 25°, since 65+25=90. 

Wait, but angle GDE is angle1, which would be 65°, making angle1=65°, which is option C. But let me verify again. 

In triangle DGE, right-angled at G, angle at E is 25°, so angle at D (angle GDE) is 90-25=65°, yes. Therefore angle1 is 65°, which would be option C. But let me check if that's consistent with other data. 

Alternatively, angle at F: in triangle DGF, right-angled at G, angle at F is 65°, so angle at D (angle FDG) is 25°, which would be angle2. So angle2=25°, angle1=65°, summing to 90°, which matches angle EDF=90°. 

Therefore, the measure of angle1 is 65°, which corresponds to option C. But let me check if there are other possibilities. 

Wait, but the answer choices include 65 as option C. However, let me check once again. 

Another approach: since GD is perpendicular to EF, then in triangle DEF, which is right-angled at D, and GD is the altitude from D to EF. In a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse creates two similar triangles. So triangle DGE ~ triangle DEF ~ triangle DGF. 

From similarity, ratios hold. But perhaps the angles in those small triangles correspond. 

For instance, in triangle DGE, angle at E is same as angle at E in triangle DEF, which is 25°, hence angle GDE is 65°, as before. Hence angle1 is 65°, so answer C. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm with another method. 

Since angle at E is 25°, and GD is perpendicular to EF, then in triangle DGE, angle at E is 25°, right angle at G, so angle at D is 65°, which is angle GDE (angle1). Thus angle1 is 65°, so answer C. 

However, looking at the answer choices, option C is 65°, so that seems correct. But wait, let me check again if there's something wrong. 

Wait, the question says Angle(G, D, E) is angle1, which is angle GDE. Yes, that's the same as above. Therefore, angle1 is 65°, so answer C. 

But wait, let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose that angle at E is 25°, and in triangle DGE, angle at E is 25°, so angle GDE is 65°, which is angle1. So answer C. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be C. However, sometimes diagrams can be tricky. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, could angle1 be 25°? No, because angle GDE is adjacent to angle at E, and in the right triangle DGE, angle at E is 25°, so angle at D is 65°. So angle1 is 65°. 

Hence, Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 1$, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem. Here's a structured breakdown of the reasoning:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are given several key pieces of information:

- $ \text{Measure}(\angle D, E, F) = 25^\circ $
- $ \text{Measure}(\angle E, F, D) = 65^\circ $
- $ \text{Measure}(\angle F, D, G) = \angle 2 $
- $ \text{Measure}(\angle G, D, E) = \angle 1 $
- $ \text{Point } G \text{ lies on line } EF $
- $ \text{Lines } GE \perp GD $

This implies that point $G$ lies on segment $EF$, and that $GD$ forms a right angle with $GE$. Therefore, line $GD$ is **perpendicular** to line $EF$ at point $G$.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Triangle $DEF$**

Using the given angles:

- $ \angle D, E, F = 25^\circ $
- $ \angle E, F, D = 65^\circ $

These are the angles at vertices $E$ and $F$ of triangle $DEF$. Summing them gives:

$$
\angle D, E, F + \angle E, F, D = 25^\circ + 65^\circ = 90^\circ
$$

Thus, the remaining angle at vertex $D$, i.e., $\angle EDF$, must be:

$$
\angle EDF = 180^\circ - 25^\circ - 65^\circ = 90^\circ
$$

So, triangle $DEF$ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at $D$.

---

### **Step 3: Use Perpendicularity to Identify Subangles**

Because $GD \perp EF$, and point $G$ lies on line $EF$, the segment $GD$ is **the altitude** from point $D$ to the hypotenuse $EF$ of triangle $DEF$.

This divides angle $\angle EDF = 90^\circ$ into two subangles:

- One is $\angle GDE = \angle 1$
- The other is $\angle FDG = \angle 2$

So,

$$
\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use Right Triangle Geometry to Find $\angle 1$**

Since $GD$ is perpendicular to $EF$, triangle $DGE$ is a right triangle with a right angle at $G$. The angle at $E$ in triangle $DGE$ is the same as $\angle D, E, F = 25^\circ$.

In triangle $DGE$, we now know:

- $\angle G = 90^\circ$
- $\angle E = 25^\circ$

So, the remaining angle at $D$ (i.e., $\angle GDE$) is:

$$
\angle GDE = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 25^\circ = 65^\circ
$$

That is:

$$
\angle GDE = \angle 1 = 65^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $\angle 1$ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{65}
$$

---

**Final Answer: C**
