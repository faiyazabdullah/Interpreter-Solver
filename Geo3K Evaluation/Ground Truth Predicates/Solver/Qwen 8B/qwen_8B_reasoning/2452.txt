MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have several angles labeled 1 through 9, and some given measures for angles 1, 2, and 3. We need to find the measure of angle 5. The diagram isn't provided, but there are some constraints given. Let me parse through the information step by step.

First, the constraints mention that certain angles are equal to others. For example, Angle(B, A, E) equals angle 1, which is 58 degrees. Then Angle(E, B, A) equals angle 2, which is 47 degrees. Similarly, Angle(D, B, E) equals angle 3, which is 26 degrees. There are also points lying on lines and parallel lines mentioned. 

Let me visualize this. Points A, B, C, D, E are involved. Since there are parallel lines AB and EC, maybe there's some transversal lines creating corresponding or alternate interior angles? Also, point C lies on line DB, and point E lies on line DA. So, line DA has point E, meaning E is somewhere between D and A? Or maybe extended?

Wait, PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, B)) means that point C is on the line connecting D and B. And PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, A)) means E is on line DA. Also, AB is parallel to EC. That seems important.

So, let me sketch a rough mental picture. Let's assume line DA exists. Point E is somewhere on DA. Then line EC is drawn such that it's parallel to AB. Since AB is parallel to EC, then maybe triangle ABC or something similar? Wait, but point C is on line DB. So, perhaps quadrilateral ABEC or some other shape?

Alternatively, since AB || EC, and considering the points, maybe there are some transversals cutting these parallel lines, leading to congruent angles. Let me think about angles around point B and E.

Given that angle 1 is at point B, between points A and E. Wait, the notation Angle(B, A, E) would mean the angle at point B formed by points A, B, E. So vertex at B, with sides BA and BE. So angle at B between BA and BE. Similarly, angle 2 is Angle(E, B, A), which is the angle at B between E, B, A. Wait, that's the same as angle 1? No, wait, angle 1 is (B, A, E), so vertex at B, with segments BA and BE. But angle 2 is (E, B, A), which is the same angle? Wait no, because the order matters. If you write Angle(E, B, A), that's the angle at B between points E, B, A. Which is the same as angle between BE and BA. Wait, that's the same angle as angle 1. But according to the constraints, MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,E)) = MeasureOf(angle 1), and MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,A)) = MeasureOf(angle 2). Wait, but those two angles are actually the same. Unless they're supplementary? Wait, but how can that be?

Hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. In angle notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y, with segments YX and YZ. So Angle(B,A,E) is the angle at A? Wait, no! Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(B, A, E) would be angle at A, with segments AB and AE. Wait, no! Wait, the standard notation is Angle(ABC) is the angle at point B. So if it's written as Angle(B, A, E), that would be angle at point A, with sides going to B and E. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user is using a different notation where the first and third letters are the endpoints, and the middle is the vertex. So Angle(B, A, E) would be the angle at point A, between points B and E. So vertex at A, with segments AB and AE. Similarly, Angle(E, B, A) would be angle at point B, between E and A. Wait, that makes more sense. Because the middle letter is the vertex.

So, Angle(B, A, E) is angle at A, with rays AB and AE. So that's angle at A between AB and AE. Similarly, Angle(E, B, A) is angle at B, between EB and BA. So those are two different angles. Therefore, angle 1 is at point A, and angle 2 is at point B. Okay, that clarifies things.

So given that, let's note down:

- Measure of angle at A (between AB and AE) is 58° (angle 1)
- Measure of angle at B (between EB and BA) is 47° (angle 2)
- Measure of angle at B (between BD and BE?) Wait, Angle(D, B, E) is angle at B between D and E. Wait, the notation is Angle(D, B, E), so vertex at B, with segments BD and BE. So that's angle at B between BD and BE, which is angle 3, measuring 26°.

Also, there's Angle(A, E, B) which is angle at E between A and B. So that's angle at E, with rays EA and EB. This is angle 6. Then Angle(B, E, C) is angle at E between B and C. So that's angle at E between BE and EC. Which is angle 5? Wait, no. Wait, the question asks for angle 5. Let me check again.

The constraints list:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, E)), MeasureOf(angle 1)) → angle 1 is at A between AB and AE.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, B, A)), MeasureOf(angle 2)) → angle 2 is at B between EB and BA.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, E)), MeasureOf(angle 3)) → angle 3 is at B between BD and BE.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, E, B)), MeasureOf(angle 6)) → angle 6 is at E between AE and EB.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, E, C)), MeasureOf(angle 5)) → angle 5 is at E between BE and EC.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, C, B)), MeasureOf(angle 4)) → angle 4 is at C between EC and CB.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, E, D)), MeasureOf(angle 7)) → angle 7 is at E between CE and ED.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, C, E)), MeasureOf(angle 8)) → angle 8 is at C between DC and CE.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, D, B)), MeasureOf(angle 9)) → angle 9 is at D between ED and DB.

Additionally, Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(E,C)). So AB is parallel to EC. Also, point C lies on line DB, and point E lies on line DA.

Now, our goal is to find the measure of angle 5, which is the angle at E between BE and EC. So angle 5 is ∠BEC.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Let me consider points:

- Line DA has point E on it. So E is somewhere along DA.

- Line DB has point C on it. So C is on line DB.

- AB is parallel to EC. So line EC is parallel to AB.

Since AB || EC, then maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Let me start by looking at triangle ABE or something else. Given that angle at A (angle 1) is 58°, angle at B (angle 2) is 47°, and angle at B (angle 3) is 26°. Wait, angle 2 and angle 3 both involve point B. Let me see.

At point B, there are multiple angles. First, angle 2 is between EB and BA, which is 47°, and angle 3 is between BD and BE, which is 26°. So, if we look at point B, the total angles around point B might sum up to 180° if they are part of a straight line or something. Wait, but depending on the configuration.

But since AB is parallel to EC, and EC connects to point C on line DB. So line EC is parallel to AB. Let me think about the transversal lines here. For instance, line BE could be a transversal intersecting AB and EC. Since AB || EC, then the corresponding angles would be equal.

Angle at B between BA and BE (which is angle 2, 47°) corresponds to angle at E between EC and EB (since EC is parallel to AB, and BE is a transversal). Therefore, angle at E between EC and EB should be equal to angle at B between BA and BE. Wait, that would make angle 5 (which is ∠BEC) equal to angle 2 (47°)? But that conflicts with possible other relations. Wait, let me verify.

If AB || EC, and BE is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be ∠ABE (at B) and ∠BEC (at E). Therefore, ∠ABE (which is angle 2, 47°) is equal to ∠BEC (angle 5). Therefore, angle 5 would be 47°, which is option B. However, that seems too straightforward, but let me check if there are other factors.

Wait, but angle 2 is ∠EB A, which is at B, between E and A. So ∠ABE is indeed 47°, and since AB || EC, then ∠BEC should be equal to ∠ABE. Hence, angle 5 is 47°, which would be answer B. However, let me check if there are other constraints that may affect this.

Wait, but maybe there are other triangles or relationships. Let me check the other given angles. For example, angle 1 is at A between AB and AE, which is 58°. Since E is on DA, then AE is part of DA. So DA is a line with point E. So maybe triangle ABE? Let me think.

In triangle ABE, we know angle at A is 58°, angle at B is 47°, so the third angle at E (angle AEB) would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. But angle AEB is angle 6, right? Because MeasureOf(Angle(A, E, B)) is angle 6. So angle 6 is 75°. Is that helpful?

Then, angle at E between AE and BE is 75°, which is angle 6. Now, since EC is parallel to AB, and E is connected to C, which is on DB. Let me consider line EC. Since EC is parallel to AB, then the slope or direction is same. So, if we can relate angles involving EC.

Earlier thought was that angle at E between BE and EC (angle 5) is equal to angle at B between AB and BE (angle 2, 47°). So angle 5 is 47°, which is answer B. But let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, since AB || EC, then the consecutive interior angles would add up to 180°. For example, if we consider line BE crossing AB and EC, then ∠ABE + ∠BEC = 180°, but only if they are on the same side. Wait, but AB || EC, and BE is a transversal. Depending on the direction, the angles could be either corresponding or same-side interior angles.

Wait, if AB || EC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So, the angle at B (ABE) and the angle at E (BEC) would be corresponding angles if BE is the transversal. Therefore, they are equal. Therefore, angle 5 is equal to angle 2, which is 47°, making answer B.

However, let me check if there's a possibility that angle 5 is supplementary. Suppose BE is a transversal, and AB || EC, then ∠ABE and ∠BEC are same-side interior angles? Wait, no. Same-side interior angles would be on the same side of the transversal. If BE crosses AB and EC, then ∠ABE is on one side, and ∠BEC is on the other side. Wait, maybe they are consecutive interior angles? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Imagine AB is horizontal, going from left to right. EC is parallel to AB, so also horizontal. BE is a line starting from B, going down to E. So when BE crosses AB at B, forming angle ABE (which is 47°), and then crosses EC at E, forming angle BEC. Since AB and EC are parallel, and BE is a transversal, then ∠ABE and ∠BEC are corresponding angles. Therefore, they are equal. Thus, angle 5 = 47°, which is answer B.

But let me cross-verify with other given angles. For example, angle 3 is 26°, which is the angle at B between BD and BE. So, at point B, the angles are:

- Between BA and BE: 47° (angle 2)

- Between BE and BD: 26° (angle 3)

Therefore, the total angle at point B between BA and BD would be 47° + 26° = 73°. Wait, unless there are other angles. Since point C is on line DB, so line BD goes through C. So, if we imagine line BD passing through C, then the angle between BA and BD is 73°, as above. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe triangle EBC? Let me think. Since EC is parallel to AB, and AB is connected to point B. So EC is parallel to AB, so EC is like a translated version of AB. If we can find some relationship there.

But maybe there's a way to use the fact that angle 1 is 58°, which is at point A. Let me think about triangle ABE. As before, in triangle ABE, angles at A=58°, at B=47°, so angle at E (angle AEB)=75°, which is angle 6. Then, since EC is parallel to AB, and E is connected to C, which is on line DB. So, EC is parallel to AB, which implies that the direction of EC is same as AB.

Now, considering line EC and AB being parallel, and point E connected to C. Then, the line EC is parallel to AB. So, if I consider triangle EBC, but I don't know much about its angles yet. Alternatively, maybe quadrilateral ABEC is a trapezoid? Since AB || EC, but not sure about the other sides.

Alternatively, since point C is on line DB, and E is on line DA, maybe there are some vertical angles or other relationships. For instance, angle at E between AE and BE is 75°, and angle at E between BE and EC is angle 5. If we can find the measure of angle AEC, then maybe we can find angle 5.

Wait, angle AEB is 75°, and angle AEC would depend on the position of point C. Since EC is parallel to AB, and E is on DA. Let me think about line EC. Since EC is parallel to AB, then the direction of EC is same as AB. So, vector AB is same as vector EC. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD? Not sure. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help.

Let me assign coordinate system. Let me place point A at origin (0,0). Let me assume AB is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set AB as x-axis. So, point A is (0,0), point B is (b, 0) for some b>0. Since E lies on line DA. But I don't know where D is yet. Wait, point E is on line DA. So, line DA passes through D and A. Let me suppose point D is somewhere else. Let me define coordinates step by step.

Let me fix coordinates:

- Let’s take A at (0, 0).

- Let’s take B at (c, 0) for some c > 0.

- Since E lies on line DA. Let me assume D is at some point, say (d_x, d_y). Then line DA connects D to A. Point E is somewhere on DA. Let me parametrize E as a point on DA. Let me say E divides DA in some ratio. But without loss of generality, maybe choosing specific values for easier calculation.

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to EC, and EC is connected to point C on line DB. Let me consider that.

Let me proceed with coordinates:

Set A at (0, 0), B at (1, 0) for simplicity. Then line AB is x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0). Now, since EC is parallel to AB, which is horizontal. Therefore, line EC must also be horizontal. So, if I can find coordinates of E and C such that EC is horizontal.

Point E is on line DA. Let me assume point D is somewhere. Let me pick D at (0, k) for some k, so line DA connects D(0,k) to A(0,0). Wait, but then line DA is vertical. Then point E is on DA, so E would be somewhere along the y-axis between D and A. Let me say E is at (0, e), where 0 < e < k.

Then line EC is horizontal (parallel to AB). Since EC is horizontal, and E is at (0,e), then point C must be horizontally aligned with E. So, line EC is horizontal, so C has the same y-coordinate as E, which is e. Since line EC is horizontal, moving left or right from E. But since line EC is connected to point C which is on line DB. Let me find coordinates of point C.

Point C lies on line DB. Let me determine coordinates of D and B. Earlier, I assumed D is (0,k), B is (1,0). So line DB connects D(0,k) to B(1,0). Parametric equations for line DB: x = t*1 + (1 - t)*0 = t, y = t*0 + (1 - t)*k = k*(1 - t), where t ∈ [0,1].

Point C is on line DB. Let me denote parameter t for point C as t_c. So coordinates of C are (t_c, k*(1 - t_c)).

Since line EC is horizontal, and E is at (0,e), then point C must have y-coordinate equal to e. So:

k*(1 - t_c) = e ⇒ 1 - t_c = e/k ⇒ t_c = 1 - e/k.

Thus, coordinates of C are (t_c, e) = (1 - e/k, e).

Now, line EC is horizontal, from E(0,e) to C(1 - e/k, e). Therefore, length of EC is (1 - e/k) - 0 = 1 - e/k.

But AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), so AB has length 1. Since EC is parallel to AB, their slopes are equal (both zero, since horizontal). So that checks out.

Now, let's compute angles based on coordinates. But this might get complex. Let me see if I can find relations.

We know angle 1 is at point A, between AB and AE. Since AB is from A(0,0) to B(1,0), and AE is from A(0,0) to E(0,e). So AE is vertical line upwards. Therefore, angle between AB (x-axis) and AE (y-axis) is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle 1 is given as 58°, which contradicts this. So my assumption of D being at (0,k) leads to angle 1 being 90°, which is conflicting with given value of 58°. Therefore, my coordinate setup is flawed.

Ah, right. Because in reality, angle 1 is at point A between AB and AE, which is not necessarily a right angle. So my previous assumption of D being at (0,k) made AE vertical, hence angle 1 being 90°, which is wrong. Therefore, I need to adjust the coordinate system.

Alternative approach: Let me assume that line DA is not vertical. Let me instead define points such that angle at A between AB and AE is 58°, which is given as angle 1.

Let me try again. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), as before. Let me define point E somewhere on line DA such that angle between AB and AE is 58°. To do this, I need to define point D and E accordingly.

Let me suppose line DA makes some angle θ with AB. Wait, but angle at A between AB and AE is 58°, so AE forms 58° with AB. Therefore, if AB is along positive x-axis, then AE is a ray from A(0,0) making 58° with AB (x-axis). So coordinates of E can be determined if we know distance from A, but since exact distances aren't given, maybe we can assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume AE has length l, so coordinates of E would be (l*cos(58°), l*sin(58°)). Let me denote l as some arbitrary positive number, say l=1 for simplicity. So E is at (cos(58°), sin(58°)) ≈ (0.5299, 0.8480).

Now, point E lies on line DA. So line DA passes through A(0,0) and D. Let me find coordinates of D. Since E is on DA, D must be a point along the line extending from A through E. Let me define D as a point further away from A along the same line as E. Let me say D is at some scalar multiple of E. For simplicity, let me take D as (k * cos(58°), k * sin(58°)) where k > 1, so that E is between A and D. But since we need point C to lie on line DB, which connects D to B(1,0). 

Now, line DB connects D(k*cosθ, k*sinθ) to B(1,0), where θ is 58°. Let me parametrize line DB. Any point on line DB can be expressed as D + t*(B - D), where t ∈ R.

Parametric equations for line DB:

x(t) = k*cosθ + t*(1 - k*cosθ)

y(t) = k*sinθ + t*(0 - k*sinθ) = k*sinθ*(1 - t)

Point C lies on line DB, so for some t_c, coordinates of C are:

x_c = k*cosθ + t_c*(1 - k*cosθ)

y_c = k*sinθ*(1 - t_c)

Also, line EC is parallel to AB. Since AB is horizontal (from (0,0) to (1,0)), so AB has slope 0. Therefore, line EC must also be horizontal. Therefore, the y-coordinate of E and C must be the same.

Coordinates of E are (k*cosθ * s, k*sinθ * s), wait no. Wait earlier, I said E is on DA, which extends from A(0,0) through D. Wait, if D is at (k*cosθ, k*sinθ), then line DA is the same as line DE, but E is between A and D? Or beyond D? Wait, if k > 1, then D is further than E from A. Wait, but earlier I said E is on DA, so D could be anywhere. Let me rephrase.

Actually, point E is on line DA. So line DA can extend infinitely in both directions. So if I take D as some point, and E is somewhere on that line. But for simplicity, let me assume that D is on the opposite side of A relative to E. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe better to use vectors or parametric equations.

Alternatively, since line EC is parallel to AB (horizontal), and E is known, then C must be at the same height as E. So y-coordinate of C is same as y-coordinate of E, which is y_E = sinθ * k (assuming earlier parameters). Wait, earlier I considered E as (cosθ, sinθ) if l=1, but if D is at (k*cosθ, k*sinθ), then E is somewhere along DA. Let me clarify.

Let me fix θ = 58°, since angle at A between AB and AE is 58°, which is angle 1. Let me set AB as x-axis, A at (0,0), B at (1,0). Let me define point E such that angle between AB (x-axis) and AE is 58°, so E lies somewhere in plane. Let me take E at (e_x, e_y), such that the angle between AB (vector (1,0)) and AE (vector (e_x, e_y)) is 58°. Using dot product:

cos(58°) = (AE · AB)/(|AE| |AB|) => (e_x * 1 + e_y * 0)/(sqrt(e_x² + e_y²) * 1) = e_x / sqrt(e_x² + e_y²) = cos(58°)

So, e_x = |AE| * cos(58°), e_y = |AE| * sin(58°). Let me choose |AE|=1 for simplicity, so E is at (cos(58°), sin(58°)) ≈ (0.5299, 0.8480).

Now, since E lies on line DA. So line DA passes through A(0,0) and D. Let me find coordinates of D. Since E is on DA, D can be any point along the line through A and E, but not coinciding with E. Let me assume D is a point such that line DA extends beyond E. Let me define D as a scalar multiple of E. Let me say D is at (m * e_x, m * e_y), where m > 1, so that D is beyond E from A.

Now, line DB connects D(m*e_x, m*e_y) to B(1,0). Let me parametrize line DB. Any point on DB can be represented as D + t*(B - D). So:

x = m*e_x + t*(1 - m*e_x)

y = m*e_y + t*(0 - m*e_y) = m*e_y*(1 - t)

Point C lies on line DB. Additionally, line EC is parallel to AB (which is horizontal), so line EC must be horizontal. Therefore, the y-coordinate of C must equal the y-coordinate of E, which is e_y.

From the parametrization of line DB, the y-coordinate of C is m*e_y*(1 - t_c) = e_y. Solving for t_c:

m*e_y*(1 - t_c) = e_y ⇒ m*(1 - t_c) = 1 ⇒ 1 - t_c = 1/m ⇒ t_c = 1 - 1/m.

Substituting back into x-coordinate:

x_c = m*e_x + (1 - 1/m)*(1 - m*e_x) 

Let me simplify:

x_c = m*e_x + (1 - 1/m)(1 - m*e_x)

Expand the second term:

= m*e_x + (1 - 1/m) - (1 - 1/m)*m*e_x 

= m*e_x + 1 - 1/m - m*e_x + e_x 

Wait, expanding:

= m*e_x + [(1 - 1/m) * 1] - [(1 - 1/m) * m*e_x]

= m*e_x + (1 - 1/m) - m*e_x + (1/m)*m*e_x 

Wait, no. Let me recalculate:

Second term: (1 - 1/m)(1 - m*e_x) = (1)(1 - m*e_x) - (1/m)(1 - m*e_x) = (1 - m*e_x) - (1/m - e_x)

So overall:

x_c = m*e_x + (1 - m*e_x) - (1/m - e_x) 

= m*e_x + 1 - m*e_x - 1/m + e_x 

= 1 - 1/m + e_x 

So x_c = 1 - 1/m + e_x 

Now, since EC is horizontal, the y-coordinate of C is e_y, and the x-coordinate is x_c. So coordinates of C are (x_c, e_y). 

Now, line EC connects E(cosθ, sinθ) to C(x_c, sinθ). Since EC is horizontal, as expected. 

Now, we need to ensure that point C lies on line DB. But we already used that condition to derive x_c. 

Now, let me recall that AB is parallel to EC. Since AB is horizontal, EC is horizontal, which we've ensured. 

Now, we need to use the given angles at point B. Specifically, angle 2 is 47°, which is the measure of Angle(E, B, A), i.e., the angle at B between EB and BA. 

To find this angle, we need to calculate the angle at B between points E, B, A. 

Point B is at (1,0). Let me find vectors BE and BA to calculate the angle between them. 

Vector BE = E - B = (cosθ - 1, sinθ - 0) = (cosθ - 1, sinθ)

Vector BA = A - B = (-1, 0)

The angle between BE and BA is angle 2, which is 47°. 

Using the dot product formula:

cos(angle 2) = (BE · BA) / (|BE| |BA|)

Compute BE · BA = (cosθ - 1)(-1) + (sinθ)(0) = -(cosθ - 1) = 1 - cosθ

|BE| = sqrt((cosθ - 1)^2 + (sinθ)^2) = sqrt(cos²θ - 2cosθ + 1 + sin²θ) = sqrt( (cos²θ + sin²θ) - 2cosθ + 1 ) = sqrt(1 - 2cosθ + 1) = sqrt(2 - 2cosθ) = sqrt(2(1 - cosθ))

|BA| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2) = 1

So,

cos(angle 2) = (1 - cosθ) / [ sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)) * 1 ] = sqrt(1 - cosθ) / sqrt(2)

Which simplifies to:

cos(angle 2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

But angle 2 is given as 47°, so:

sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = cos(47°)

Square both sides:

(1 - cosθ)/2 = cos²(47°)

Multiply both sides by 2:

1 - cosθ = 2cos²(47°)

Rearranged:

cosθ = 1 - 2cos²(47°)

Recall that cos(2α) = 2cos²α - 1 ⇒ 2cos²α = 1 + cos(2α). So:

1 - 2cos²(47°) = -cos(94°)

Wait, substituting:

cosθ = 1 - 2cos²(47°) = -cos(94°)

Because 2cos²(α) = 1 + cos(2α), so 1 - 2cos²(α) = -cos(2α). So here α is 47°, so 2α = 94°. Therefore:

cosθ = -cos(94°) = cos(180° - 94°) = cos(86°). Wait, cos(-x) = cosx, but here it's negative. Wait:

Wait, cosθ = -cos(94°). So θ = arccos(-cos94°). Let me calculate this numerically.

cos(94°) ≈ cos(90° + 4°) = -sin(4°) ≈ -0.0698

So -cos(94°) ≈ 0.0698

So cosθ ≈ 0.0698 ⇒ θ ≈ arccos(0.0698) ≈ 86°, since cos(86°) ≈ 0.0698. 

Wait, but earlier we defined θ as the angle between AB and AE, which is angle 1, which is given as 58°. But according to this calculation, θ ≈ 86°, which contradicts angle 1 being 58°. What's wrong here?

Ah! Wait, I think I confused variables. Earlier, I set θ as the angle between AB and AE, which is angle 1 = 58°, but in the calculation above, I derived θ from angle 2 = 47°, leading to θ ≈ 86°, which conflicts with angle 1 being 58°. This suggests inconsistency, implying that my assumptions are conflicting, possibly due to incorrect coordinate assignments.

This indicates that my current approach may have errors. Perhaps I need to reconsider the coordinate setup or the relationships.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that line EC is horizontal. Wait, no—because AB is horizontal and EC is parallel to AB, so yes, EC must be horizontal.

But if angle 1 is 58°, which is the angle between AB and AE, then θ = 58°, but according to the calculation, it should be ≈86° to satisfy angle 2 = 47°. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation.

Let me redo the calculation for angle 2. 

We had:

cos(angle 2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Wait, let's double-check:

BE · BA = 1 - cosθ

|BE| = sqrt(2(1 - cosθ))

|BA| = 1

So cos(angle 2) = (1 - cosθ)/sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)) = sqrt(1 - cosθ)/sqrt(2)

Yes, that's correct.

So sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = cos(angle 2)

So squaring both sides: (1 - cosθ)/2 = cos²(angle 2)

So 1 - cosθ = 2cos²(angle 2)

So cosθ = 1 - 2cos²(angle 2)

Now, angle 2 is given as 47°, so let's compute this:

cos(47°) ≈ 0.6820

So cos²(47°) ≈ 0.4651

Then 2cos²(47°) ≈ 0.9302

Thus, cosθ = 1 - 0.9302 = 0.0698

So θ = arccos(0.0698) ≈ 86.0°, as before.

But this contradicts angle 1 being 58°, which is supposed to be θ. So this suggests that with angle 2 = 47°, angle 1 cannot be 58°, which is a contradiction. This implies that there's an error in my assumptions or approach.

Wait, but the problem states that angle 1 = 58°, angle 2 = 47°, angle 3 = 26°, and asks for angle 5. So these values should be consistent. My calculation shows inconsistency, indicating that my model is incorrect.

Maybe the issue is in assuming that line EC is horizontal? No, because AB is parallel to EC, and AB is horizontal, so EC should be horizontal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at B between BE and BA (angle 2) is not the one I calculated. Let me re-express the angle.

Wait, angle at B between EB and BA is angle 2. In the coordinate system, point B is at (1,0), E is at (cosθ, sinθ), and A is at (0,0). So vectors BE and BA are as follows:

BE: from B to E: E - B = (cosθ - 1, sinθ - 0) = (cosθ - 1, sinθ)

BA: from B to A: A - B = (-1, 0)

The angle between BE and BA is angle 2, which is 47°. 

But in my calculation, I used vectors BE and BA, but perhaps I should use vectors EB and BA? Wait, no—the angle at B between EB and BA is the angle between BE and BA, but depending on the direction. Let me confirm.

The angle at B between EB and BA is the angle between BE and BA. Yes, because at point B, the segments are BE and BA. So the angle between BE and BA is indeed the angle between vectors BE and BA, as calculated. 

But according to this, with angle 1 = θ = 58°, angle 2 would be computed as:

cos(angle 2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Plugging θ = 58°:

cosθ ≈ cos(58°) ≈ 0.5299

So 1 - cosθ ≈ 1 - 0.5299 = 0.4701

Divide by 2: 0.23505

Square root: ~0.4848

So cos(angle 2) ≈ 0.4848 ⇒ angle 2 ≈ 60.9°, which is approximately 61°, but the given angle 2 is 47°. So this is inconsistent. Hence, there's a fundamental conflict here, suggesting that my coordinate setup is invalid.

Perhaps the problem is that I assumed AB is horizontal and AE makes angle 1 with AB, but the actual configuration requires that angle 1, 2, and 3 are related in a way that satisfies all conditions. This suggests that my coordinate approach is too rigid and not accounting for all constraints.

Let me try a different method, focusing on the angles and parallel lines.

Given that AB || EC, and we have angles at various points.

From earlier, if AB || EC, then corresponding angles are equal. Specifically, angle at B between AB and BE (angle 2) corresponds to angle at E between EC and BE (angle 5). Hence, angle 5 = angle 2 = 47°. This would suggest answer B. 

But why did the earlier coordinate approach fail? Because it tried to enforce angle 1 and angle 2 simultaneously, leading to contradictions, suggesting that the configuration is possible only if certain conditions are met, but maybe the key is to focus on the parallel lines and corresponding angles.

Another approach: Let's consider triangle ABE. We know angle at A (angle 1) is 58°, angle at B (angle 2) is 47°, so angle at E (angle 6) is 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. So angle 6 is 75°.

Now, since AB || EC, and line BE intersects both AB and EC, then angle between BE and AB (angle 2) is equal to angle between BE and EC (angle 5), because they are corresponding angles. Hence, angle 5 = 47°, which matches answer B.

But let me check if there's any other constraint that could change this. For example, angle 3 is 26°, which is the angle at B between BD and BE. So at point B, angles around B include angle 2 (47°), angle 3 (26°), and possibly others. If line BD passes through C, and EC is parallel to AB, then maybe there's a relation involving angle 3.

At point B, the angles around it: if we consider line BD, which contains point C, and line BE. So angle between BE and BD is 26° (angle 3). If we can find the total angle at B, it might relate to other parts.

But since AB is parallel to EC, and EC meets BE at E, and C is on BD, perhaps there's a way to connect these.

Alternatively, consider triangle BEC. We know angle at E is angle 5 (which we think is 47°), and if we can find other angles in this triangle, but we need more information.

Wait, but if EC is parallel to AB, then the angle between EC and BE (angle 5) is equal to angle between AB and BE (angle 2), hence 47°, as before.

This seems solid. The earlier coordinate approach failed because of conflicting assumptions, but the parallel lines and corresponding angles give a direct relation.

Therefore, angle 5 is 47°, so the answer is B.

But let me check if there's any reason this wouldn't hold. For example, if the lines were not transversals or if there were other intersections, but since AB || EC and BE is a transversal, the corresponding angles should be equal. Hence, angle 2 and angle 5 are corresponding angles, thus equal.

Hence, the measure of angle 5 is 47°, which is option B.
