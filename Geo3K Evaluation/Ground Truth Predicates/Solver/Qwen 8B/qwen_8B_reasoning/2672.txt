MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have points A, B, C, D with some given lengths and angle conditions. Let me start by jotting down all the given information.

First, the problem states that:

- The length of line BD is equal to y (so BD = y).
- Length of BC is 30 units.
- Length of CD is 28 units.
- Length of AD is 8 units.
- Point A lies on line CD.
- The measure of angle at point B between points C and A (angle CBA) is equal to the measure of angle at point B between points A and D (angle ABD). So, ∠CBA ≅ ∠ABD.

We need to find the value of y, which is the length of BD.

Let me visualize this. Points C and D are connected, with CD being 28. Point A is somewhere on CD because it says point A lies on line CD. Also, AD is 8 units long. Since A is on CD, then DA + AC = CD? Wait, but CD is 28. If AD is 8, then AC would be CD - AD = 28 - 8 = 20. So AC = 20?

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm. If A is on line CD, then depending on the position of A, AD could be part of CD. For example, suppose the order is C---A---D, then CA + AD = CD. But since CD is 28 and AD is 8, then CA would be 20. Alternatively, if A were between C and D such that CA is something else... Wait, maybe I should draw coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's place points C and D on the x-axis for simplicity. Let’s set coordinate system:

Let me assume that point C is at (0, 0), and point D is at (28, 0) since CD is 28 units. Then, point A is somewhere on line CD. Since AD is 8 units, then if D is at (28, 0), then point A can be located either to the left or right of D along CD. Wait, but since CD is from C(0,0) to D(28,0), then moving along CD towards D, the distance from A to D is 8. Therefore, A is located 8 units away from D towards C. So starting from D(28,0), moving 8 units towards C (which is left along the x-axis), so A's x-coordinate is 28 - 8 = 20. Hence, coordinates of A would be (20, 0).

So, A is at (20, 0). Then, AC is from A(20,0) to C(0,0), which is 20 units. That matches our previous thought. Now, point B is another point such that BC = 30 units. So, point B is somewhere not on the x-axis, since otherwise BC would be along x-axis, but then angles might not work. Let me think about coordinates for B.

But also, there's an angle condition: angle CBA equals angle ABD. So, angle at B between C and A is equal to angle at B between A and D. That suggests that BA is the angle bisector of angle CBD? Or perhaps some reflection or symmetry?

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines or Cosines here. Maybe triangles involved here. Let me consider triangle ABC and triangle ABD? Wait, but how do they relate?

Wait, angle CBA is equal to angle ABD. So, those two angles are adjacent at point B. Let me imagine triangle ABC and triangle BAD. Wait, not sure yet.

Alternatively, since angles at B are equal, maybe there is some similarity or congruence.

Alternatively, since angles are equal, maybe we can use the Law of Sines in triangles ABC and ABD?

Wait, let me try to write down the coordinates.

Points:

C = (0, 0)

D = (28, 0)

A = (20, 0)

Now, point B is unknown. We know BC = 30. So, coordinates of B satisfy distance from C(0,0) to B(x,y) is 30. So:

√[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 30 → x² + y² = 900.

Also, BD is the distance from B to D(28,0): √[(x - 28)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = y (given as BD = y). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), y). So BD = y. Therefore:

√[(x - 28)^2 + y^2] = y → square both sides: (x - 28)^2 + y^2 = y² → (x - 28)^2 = 0 → x - 28 = 0 → x = 28. Wait, that would mean that point B has x-coordinate 28. But then, if x=28, then from earlier equation, x² + y² = 900 becomes 28² + y² = 900 → y² = 900 - 784 = 116 → y = sqrt(116) ≈ 10.77. However, then BD would be distance from B(28, y) to D(28, 0) is |y - 0| = |y|. So BD = y. Which would mean that y is positive, so y = sqrt(116). But sqrt(116) is approx 10.77, which isn't among the answer choices (the options are 8,9,12,15). So that seems contradictory. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, hold on. Because if BD is supposed to be y, then according to my calculation, BD = y. But in this case, BD would be vertical distance from B to D, which is y. But then, solving gives us that x=28, leading to y=sqrt(900 - 28²) = sqrt(900 - 784)=sqrt(116). But that's approximately 10.77, which is not in the answer choices. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, why did I assume that BD = y implies (x - 28)^2 + y^2 = y²? Wait, no! Wait, BD is the length of segment BD, which is sqrt[(x_B - x_D)^2 + (y_B - y_D)^2]. In my setup, D is at (28, 0), and B is at (x, y). So BD squared is (x - 28)^2 + (y - 0)^2. But the problem says that BD = y. Wait, but that would mean that BD = y, which is a length. However, in this case, BD is sqrt[(x - 28)^2 + y^2], so setting that equal to y gives:

sqrt[(x - 28)^2 + y^2] = y → squaring both sides: (x - 28)^2 + y^2 = y² → (x - 28)^2 = 0 → x = 28. Which leads us back to the same conclusion. But then, if x=28, then BC is the distance from B(28, y) to C(0,0):

sqrt[(28 - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = sqrt(784 + y²) = 30. So 784 + y² = 900 → y² = 116 → y = sqrt(116). But none of the answer choices are close to this. So this suggests that my assumption of coordinates may be incorrect.

Hmm. Where is the error here?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the position of A. Let me check again. The problem says Point LIES ON LINE CD. So A is on line CD. But CD is from C to D. But maybe A is not between C and D? For example, maybe A is beyond D, extending the line CD beyond D. So if CD is from C(0,0) to D(28,0), then A could be at (28 + k, 0) for some k. Then AD would be the distance from A to D, which would be k. Given that AD is 8, then k = 8. Thus, A would be at (28 + 8, 0) = (36, 0). Then, AC would be the distance from A(36,0) to C(0,0), which is 36 units. But then, in this case, when considering BC = 30, and BD = ?

Wait, but in this scenario, if A is beyond D, then BD is still the distance from B to D, which is still dependent on where B is. But maybe this approach is better?

Alternatively, maybe A is not on segment CD but extended. Let me re-examine the problem statement: "PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C, D))". This means that A is somewhere on the infinite line CD, which includes the segment CD and its extensions. So A can be anywhere along that line, not necessarily between C and D.

Therefore, if AD = 8, then depending on whether A is between C and D or outside, the positions change. Let me explore both possibilities.

Case 1: A is between C and D. Then, as before, CD = 28, AD = 8 ⇒ AC = CD - AD = 20. Coordinates: C(0,0), D(28,0), A(20,0). Then, proceeding as before, but that led to inconsistency.

Case 2: A is beyond D, so that AD = 8. Then, coordinates of A would be D plus 8 units along CD direction. Since CD is from C(0,0) to D(28,0), direction vector is (28,0). So moving from D(28,0) in the same direction, adding 8 units. The unit vector along CD is (1, 0). So A is at (28 + 8, 0) = (36, 0). Then, AC is the distance from A(36,0) to C(0,0): 36 units. Then, BC = 30, BD = y.

In this case, let's see if we can find coordinates of B.

Again, assuming coordinates for B: Let me denote B as (x, y). Then:

Distance from B to C(0,0) is 30: √(x² + y²) = 30 → x² + y² = 900.

Distance from B to D(28,0) is y: √[(x - 28)^2 + y²] = y → Squaring gives (x - 28)^2 + y² = y² ⇒ (x - 28)^2 = 0 ⇒ x = 28. So again, x = 28, hence B is at (28, y). Then, plugging into BC distance: (28)^2 + y² = 900 ⇒ 784 + y² = 900 ⇒ y² = 116 ⇒ y = √116 ≈ 10.77. Still not matching answer choices. So even in this case, we get the same issue.

This suggests that my coordinate system assumption might be flawed. Perhaps I need to consider that the angles are equal, so there's more constraints.

Wait, the key thing is the angle equality: ∠CBA = ∠ABD. Let me think about this. At point B, angles CBA and ABD are equal. So, if I consider lines BC, BA, and BD. So, angle between CB and BA is equal to angle between AB and BD. So, this suggests that BA is the angle bisector of angle CBD. Wait, because angle CBA and angle ABD are adjacent angles forming angle CBD. If they are equal, then BA bisects angle CBD.

Yes! So, if ∠CBA = ∠ABD, then BA is the angle bisector of angle CBD. Therefore, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem says that if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But here, we have triangle CBD with angle bisector at B, which is BA. Wait, but BA connects to point A on line CD. So, applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle CBD with bisector BA. Wait, but A is on CD. So, the theorem would state that CA / AD = BC / BD.

Wait, yes! The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if BA bisects angle CBD, then CA / AD = BC / BD.

Wait, but let me confirm. In triangle CBD, if BA is the bisector of angle at B, then it meets CD at A. Therefore, the theorem says that CA / AD = BC / BD.

Yes! So, CA / AD = BC / BD. 

Given that, let me plug in the known values.

From earlier, depending on where A is. Earlier, in Case 1 (A between C and D), CA was 20, AD was 8. Then, CA/AD = 20/8 = 5/2. And BC is 30, BD is y. So according to the theorem, 5/2 = 30/y ⇒ y = (30 * 2)/5 = 12. Which is option C. 

But wait, in that case, if we take that approach, regardless of coordinates, the answer would be 12. But earlier, when trying coordinates, I got conflicting results. What's the discrepancy?

Ah! Because in that coordinate approach, I assumed specific positions for A and B, but didn't account for the angle condition properly. However, using the Angle Bisector Theorem directly gives us the relation CA/AD = BC/BD, which allows us to compute y without needing coordinates.

So, let me redo the steps:

Since BA is the angle bisector of angle CBD, by the Angle Bisector Theorem:

CA / AD = BC / BD.

We need to find CA and AD. 

But first, we need to determine whether A is between C and D or not. How can we figure that out?

Well, we know that AD = 8, and CD = 28. If A is between C and D, then CA + AD = CD ⇒ CA = CD - AD = 28 - 8 = 20. If A is not between C and D, then CA = CD + AD or something else. But since the Angle Bisector Theorem requires that A lies on CD, which it does, but the theorem applies regardless of whether A is between C and D or not. However, the ratio CA/AD depends on the position of A.

But how do we know if A is between C and D or not? Well, in the problem statement, it just says that A lies on line CD. So, we need to figure out based on the given data. 

However, if we apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, we can proceed with variables. Let me define:

Let’s let CA = m and AD = n. Then, from the Angle Bisector Theorem, m/n = BC / BD. We know BC = 30, BD = y (what we need to find). Also, since A lies on line CD, the total length CD is either m + n or |m - n| depending on the position of A. But we know CD = 28. So:

If A is between C and D, then CD = CA + AD ⇒ 28 = m + n. Since AD is given as 8, then n = 8, so m = 28 - 8 = 20.

If A is not between C and D, say A is beyond D, then CD = AD - CA ⇒ 28 = n - m. But since AD = n = 8, then 28 = 8 - m ⇒ m = 8 - 28 = -20. But length can't be negative. So that would imply that CA = 20, but direction matters. However, in terms of absolute values, the ratio would still be m/n = |CA| / |AD|, but signs depend on the direction.

But since lengths are positive, regardless of position, the ratio CA/AD is positive. Therefore, regardless of whether A is between C and D or not, the ratio m/n would be positive. 

But in the case where A is beyond D, then CA = CD + DA = 28 + 8 = 36, and AD = 8. Then, m/n = 36/8 = 9/2. Then, according to the Angle Bisector Theorem, 9/2 = 30/y ⇒ y = (30 * 2)/9 = 60/9 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666..., which is not among the answer choices. Hence, this suggests that A must be between C and D, making m = 20, n = 8. 

Thus, substituting into the theorem: m/n = 20/8 = 5/2 = 30/y ⇒ y = 30 * 2 / 5 = 12. Which is option C.

Therefore, the answer should be 12. 

But why did my coordinate approach give a different answer? Because I incorrectly assumed that BD = y implied that x = 28, but that was under the assumption that A is between C and D. However, when applying the Angle Bisector Theorem, we don't need to worry about coordinates; the theorem gives a direct relationship. 

Wait, but maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me verify with coordinates again. Suppose A is between C and D, so coordinates as before: C(0,0), D(28,0), A(20,0). Then, BA is the angle bisector of angle CBD. So, using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have CA / AD = BC / BD ⇒ 20 / 8 = 30 / y ⇒ y = 12. 

But if we want to find coordinates of B, then we can use that. Let me try again. Let me suppose that BD = y = 12. So, BD = 12. So, distance from B to D is 12. Also, distance from B to C is 30. So, coordinates of B satisfy:

distance from C(0,0) to B(x,y) is 30: x² + y² = 900,

distance from D(28,0) to B(x,y) is 12: (x - 28)^2 + y² = 144.

Subtracting the second equation from the first: x² + y² - [(x - 28)^2 + y²] = 900 - 144 ⇒ x² - (x² - 56x + 784) = 756 ⇒ x² - x² +56x - 784 = 756 ⇒ 56x = 756 + 784 = 1540 ⇒ x = 1540 / 56 = 27.5. 

Then, x = 27.5. Plugging back into x² + y² = 900:

(27.5)^2 + y² = 900. Calculate 27.5^2: 27.5 * 27.5 = (27 + 0.5)^2 = 27² + 2*27*0.5 + 0.5² = 729 + 27 + 0.25 = 756.25. So:

756.25 + y² = 900 ⇒ y² = 900 - 756.25 = 143.75 ⇒ y = sqrt(143.75) ≈ 12.0. Indeed, since y = 12, sqrt(144) = 12, but here it's 143.75. Wait, there's a slight discrepancy due to rounding? Wait, 143.75 is 115/8? Wait, 143.75 = 143 + 3/4 = 143.75. Wait, but if BD is supposed to be 12, then (x - 28)^2 + y² should equal 12² = 144. Let me check with x = 27.5:

(x - 28) = -0.5, so (-0.5)^2 + y² = 0.25 + y² = 144 ⇒ y² = 143.75. So that's correct. Therefore, the coordinates of B would be (27.5, sqrt(143.75)). So, that works. Therefore, in this case, BD is indeed 12, as per the calculation. So, this shows that the answer y = 12 is valid, and the earlier confusion was due to miscalculating the coordinate approach. 

Hence, the correct answer is C. 12.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and leveraging the **Angle Bisector Theorem**, which is highly relevant given the constraint involving equal angles at vertex $ B $. Here's the structured breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(CD) = 28 $
- $ \text{Length}(AD) = 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 30 $
- $ \text{Length}(BD) = y $ (this is what we're solving for)
- $ A $ lies on line $ CD $
- $ \angle CBA = \angle ABD $

This last condition tells us that **$ BA $ is the angle bisector** of $ \angle CBD $.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem**

The **Angle Bisector Theorem** states:

> If a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Applying this to triangle $ CBD $ with angle bisector $ BA $, we have:

$$
\frac{CA}{AD} = \frac{BC}{BD}
$$

We are given:

- $ AD = 8 $
- $ BC = 30 $
- $ BD = y $ (unknown)
- $ CD = 28 $

Assuming $ A $ lies **between** $ C $ and $ D $, we calculate:

$$
CA = CD - AD = 28 - 8 = 20
$$

Now substitute into the proportion:

$$
\frac{CA}{AD} = \frac{BC}{BD} \Rightarrow \frac{20}{8} = \frac{30}{y}
$$

Cross-multiplying:

$$
20y = 240 \Rightarrow y = \frac{240}{20} = 12
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Answer**

All steps are consistent and logically derived. Therefore, the value of $ y $, i.e., the length of $ BD $, is:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

---

**Final Answer:** C  
$$
\text{Final Answer: C}
$$
