Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

Given angles:
- Measure of angle at A, between points G and E (Angle(A, G, E)) is 55 degrees. So that's ∠AGE = 55°.
- Measure of angle at E, between points B and H (Angle(E, B, H)) is y. So ∠EBH = y.
- Measure of angle at B, between points G and A (Angle(B, G, A)) is x. That's ∠GBA = x.

Points lying on lines:
- Point G lies on line AC.
- Point B lies on line GF.
- Point G lies on line BE.
- Point B lies on line DH.
- Point B lies on line EF.
- Point G lies on line EF.
- Lines BD and AG are parallel.

So first, maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

Let me note down the key elements:

Lines involved: AC, GF, BE, DH, EF, and AG. Also, BD || AG.

Since BD is parallel to AG, perhaps there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles we can use.

Starting with the angles given. The first angle is ∠AGE = 55°. Since point G is on line BE (from PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B,E))), so line BE passes through G. Also, G is on line AC. So point G is the intersection of BE and AC?

Wait, but also, G is on line EF (PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,F))). So line EF passes through G as well. Therefore, point G is the intersection of BE, AC, and EF. Hmm, that might form some triangle or something.

Also, point B is on line GF (so line GF contains point B) and line DH (point B lies on line DH). Also, point B is on line EF (since PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(E,F))). Wait, so line EF contains both B and G? Because G is on EF and B is on EF. So points B and G lie on line EF. Therefore, line EF connects points B and G. Wait, but then line GF is part of line EF? Because B is on GF, which is same as line EF. So GF is a segment of EF. Maybe?

Also, line BD is parallel to AG. So BD || AG. Since AG is a line from A to G, which is on BE and EF. Let me try to think about triangles here.

Looking at angle ∠AGE = 55°. Since G is on BE and EF, maybe triangle AGE is part of some larger structure. Also, since BD is parallel to AG, maybe there's a transversal creating some similar triangles or using the properties of parallel lines.

But perhaps focusing on the angles around point B. We have angle ∠GBA = x. Also, point B is on line EF, so line EF passes through B. Also, point B is on line DH and line GF (which is part of EF). So line DH goes through B. Also, point B is connected to H via line DH, and there's an angle at E involving H (∠EBH = y).

Hmm. Let me consider the lines and their intersections. Since BD || AG, and AG is connected to point A and G. If I can find some relationships between these lines.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABG? Wait, angle at B is x, angle at A is... Well, angle at A is part of ∠AGE. Wait, maybe not directly.

Alternatively, since BD || AG, and suppose there's a transversal cutting them. For example, line BF or something else. Wait, point B is on line GF, which is part of EF. So line BF could be a transversal? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, looking for cyclic quadrilaterals or something. But maybe not necessary.

Another approach: Let's look for vertical angles or supplementary angles. Since BD || AG, and if there's a transversal intersecting them, then corresponding angles would be equal.

For instance, if line BG intersects BD and AG, but BD is parallel to AG. Wait, line BG is connecting B to G. If BD is parallel to AG, then maybe line BG is a transversal. Let me see:

If BD || AG, and line BG intersects BD at B and AG at G. Then, the angles formed at those intersections would be related. Specifically, the angle between BG and BD at B should be equal to the angle between BG and AG at G, because they're corresponding angles.

So, ∠ABG (which is angle at B between A and G, i.e., ∠GBA = x) would be equal to the angle between BG and AG at G. Wait, but the angle between BG and AG at G would be part of another angle. Let me clarify.

At point G, line AG meets line BG. Since BD || AG, and line BG is a transversal. So the angle between BG and AG at G is equal to the angle between BG and BD at B. Wait, no. If BD || AG, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So when line BG crosses BD and AG, the corresponding angles would be equal.

Wait, the direction matters. Suppose BD is parallel to AG. Let me assume that BD is going in one direction, AG in another. The line BG acts as a transversal crossing BD and AG. Therefore, the angle between BD and BG at B equals the angle between AG and BG at G. So, ∠DBG = ∠AGB.

But ∠AGB is part of triangle AGB. Wait, but how does that relate to our known angles?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write down equations based on the given angles and relationships.

We know that ∠AGE = 55°, which is an angle at G. Since G lies on BE and EF, and A-G-E is a straight line? Wait, no. Wait, point G is on line AC, so A-G-C is a straight line. And G is also on line BE and EF. So line BE passes through G, and line EF passes through G. Therefore, point G is the intersection of BE, EF, and AC.

Therefore, line BE intersects line EF at G. So, points B, E, F are connected such that line BE meets EF at G. Wait, but line EF already includes G. So line BE and EF meet at G. Which means that E is on line BE, so E is one endpoint of BE, and G is another point on BE. Then, line EF starts at E and goes through G to F. So E-F-G-B? Or E-G-F-B?

Wait, line EF passes through G. So starting from E, going through G to F. So E---G---F. And line BE passes through G. So B is connected to E, passing through G. So B---E---G---F.

So points B, E, G, F are colinear? No, wait. Line BE passes through G, so points B, E, G are colinear. But line EF passes through G as well, so E, G, F are colinear. Hence, points B, E, G, F are colinear? So B-E-G-F? Yes! Because line BE goes through G, and line EF goes through G. So combining these, the entire line is B-E-G-F. Therefore, points B, E, G, F lie on the same straight line. That's important.

Therefore, line BEGF is a straight line. So B----E----G----F.

Now, since line BD is parallel to AG. Let me recall that AG is a line from A to G. So AG connects A to G, which is on line BEGF.

So BD || AG. Now, point B is on line BD (as per PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(D,H)). Wait, line DH passes through B. So point B is on line DH, which is different from BD? Wait, the constraint says:

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(D, H)): So point B is on line DH. So line DH connects D and H, and passes through B. Also, PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(E, F)): so B is on line EF, which we've established as the line B-E-G-F. Therefore, line DH passes through B and extends to points D and H. So line DH intersects line EF at point B.

So, BD is a segment from B to D, but since B is on DH, then BD is part of line DH. Wait, but earlier it said that BD is parallel to AG. So line BD is parallel to line AG.

So line BD || line AG.

Now, since AG is a line from A to G, which is on line BEGF. Let me consider triangle ABG or something else.

Also, we have angle ∠GBA = x, which is the angle at B between points G and A. So that's the angle between BA and BG. Since B is on line EF, which is B-E-G-F. So BA is connected to point A. So point A is somewhere off the line BEGF.

Let me try to reconstruct coordinates or assign variables to make sense of this.

Alternatively, focus on angles. Since BD || AG, then the angles formed by a transversal would be equal. For example, if we take line BA as a transversal intersecting BD and AG.

Wait, line BA intersects BD at B, and line BA would intersect AG at A. Wait, but BD || AG, so if line BA is a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Wait, but unless BA is a transversal that cuts both BD and AG.

Wait, line BA starts at B and goes to A. Since BD is parallel to AG, and line BA intersects BD at B and AG at A. Therefore, the angles formed at B and A would be related.

Specifically, the angle between BA and BD at B would be equal to the angle between BA and AG at A, due to the parallel lines. Wait, no, that's only if the lines are cut by a transversal. Wait, BD || AG, and BA is a transversal. Therefore, the angle between BA and BD at B is equal to the angle between BA and AG at A. Wait, but since BD || AG, and BA is a transversal, the corresponding angles would be equal. So ∠ABD (at B) equals ∠BAG (at A).

Wait, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD at B. And ∠BAG is the angle between BA and AG at A. Therefore, ∠ABD = ∠BAG.

But we don't know ∠ABD yet. However, we do know some angles related to point G.

Earlier, we had ∠AGE = 55°, which is the angle at G between points A and E. Since G is on line BEGF, and E is on line BE. So line GE is part of line BEGF. So angle at G between A and E is ∠AGE. Since E is on line BE, and G is on BE, then AE is not necessarily aligned with anything. Wait, but AG connects A to G. So ∠AGE is formed by GA and GE. Since E is on line BE, GE is along BE. Therefore, ∠AGE is the angle between GA and BE at point G.

So, in triangle AGE, we have angle at G is 55°, and we might be able to find other angles if we can relate sides or other angles.

But maybe we can use the fact that BD || AG. Let me consider triangle ABG again. Let me denote ∠GBA = x (angle at B), ∠BAG is some angle, and ∠AGB is another angle. In triangle ABG, the sum of angles is 180°, so x + ∠BAG + ∠AGB = 180°.

But earlier, I thought that ∠ABD = ∠BAG because of the parallel lines. Let me confirm that.

Since BD || AG, and BA is a transversal, then ∠ABD corresponds to ∠BAG. Therefore, ∠ABD = ∠BAG. Let me call ∠ABD as α, so ∠BAG = α.

But ∠ABD is an angle at B between AB and BD. Since BD is part of line DH, and point B is on line DH. Also, line DH goes to H, and we have angle ∠EBH = y. So ∠EBH is the angle at B between points E and H. Since B is on line EF (BEGF), and H is on line DH. So line BH is connected to H, making angle ∠EBH = y.

So, ∠EBH is adjacent to ∠ABD? Depending on the configuration. Let me think. If line BD is parallel to AG, and line DH passes through B, then depending on the direction of BD relative to BE, the angle ∠ABD could be related to ∠EBH.

Wait, since line EF is B-E-G-F, and line BD is parallel to AG. Let me think about directions. Let me try to imagine point D somewhere such that BD is parallel to AG. Since AG goes from A to G, which is on line BEGF. So AG has a certain direction. BD is parallel to that. 

Assuming that line BD is drawn such that it's parallel to AG, and point D is somewhere away from the main figure. 

But perhaps focusing back on angles. At point B, we have several angles:

- ∠GBA = x (between GB and BA)
- ∠ABD = α (between BA and BD)
- ∠EBH = y (between EB and BH)

Since points E, B, G, F are colinear (line BEGF), then EB is part of that line. So line EB is the same as line BG extended beyond B to E. Wait, no. Earlier, we said that line BE passes through G, so E is one end, G is another, and B is on the extension. Wait, actually, earlier conclusion was that B-E-G-F are colinear. So from B to E to G to F. So line BE is extended past E to G and F.

Thus, at point B, line BE is extending towards E, and line BD is going off in some direction (parallel to AG). Also, line BH is connected to H, forming angle ∠EBH = y.

So, at point B, the angles around it:

- Between BE (which is the line going from B through E) and BD (direction towards D): that's ∠DBE. Wait, but earlier mentioned ∠EBH = y, which is between EB and BH. So BH is another line from B, making angle y with BE. Since BD is parallel to AG, and assuming that BH is in some relation to BD...

This seems getting complicated. Let me try to connect the dots.

Since BD || AG, and if I can find a relationship between angles involving BD and AG.

Earlier, I considered that ∠ABD = ∠BAG (because of the parallel lines). So if I can express ∠BAG in terms of known angles.

In triangle ABG, angles are x (at B), ∠BAG (at A), and ∠AGB (at G). Sum to 180°.

But ∠AGB is the angle at G between AG and BG. Since G is on line BE, which is the same as line BG extended. So line BG is part of line BEGF. So ∠AGB is the angle between AG and BG, which is the same as ∠AGE? Wait, no. Wait, at point G, line AG meets line BG. But line BG is part of line BEGF, so line BG is going from B through G to E. So ∠AGB is the angle between AG and BG at G.

But earlier, we were told that ∠AGE = 55°, which is the angle between AG and GE at G. Since GE is part of line BEGF (GE is from G to E), which is the same as line BG extended backwards. Therefore, ∠AGE is the same as ∠AGB? Because GE is the same as GB extended in the opposite direction. Wait, if you look at point G, with lines AG and GE (which is part of BG). So ∠AGE is the angle between AG and GE, which is the same as the angle between AG and GB, because GE is in the direction opposite to GB. Wait, GE is from G to E, which is the same line as BG extended from G to E. Therefore, ∠AGE is the angle between AG and GE (same as BG), so ∠AGB is supplementary to ∠AGE?

Wait, if you imagine at point G, AG forms an angle with GE (which is the same line as GB extended). So ∠AGE is the angle between AG and GE, which is the same as the angle between AG and GB, but on the other side. Wait, maybe ∠AGB and ∠AGE are supplementary? Because if you consider that GE is a straight line from G to E, and BG is the same line extended from G to B. So the angle between AG and GE is ∠AGE, and the angle between AG and GB would be 180° minus ∠AGE, because they are on a straight line.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If you have a point G, with two lines: one is AG, and another is GE (which is part of line BEGF). So the angle between AG and GE is ∠AGE. But line GE is the same as line BG extended from G to E. So the angle between AG and BG at point G is ∠AGB, which is the same as ∠AGE? No, because ∠AGB is the angle between AG and BG, whereas ∠AGE is between AG and GE. But GE is the same as BG extended in the opposite direction. So ∠AGE and ∠AGB are supplementary. Because they are on a straight line. So ∠AGE + ∠AGB = 180°.

Therefore, ∠AGB = 180° - ∠AGE = 180° - 55° = 125°.

So in triangle ABG, we have:

∠AGB = 125°, ∠GBA = x, and ∠BAG = ?

Sum of angles: x + ∠BAG + 125° = 180° => ∠BAG = 55° - x? Wait, no:

Wait, total is 180°, so:

x + ∠BAG + 125° = 180° → ∠BAG = 180° - x - 125° = 55° - x.

Wait, that gives ∠BAG = 55° - x.

But earlier, I thought that ∠ABD = ∠BAG because of BD || AG. So ∠ABD = ∠BAG = 55° - x.

But what is ∠ABD?

At point B, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD. Since BD is parallel to AG, and BA is a transversal, as discussed before.

Now, let's consider the angles at point B. There's the angle ∠GBA = x (between GB and BA), and the angle ∠ABD = 55° - x (between BA and BD). Also, there's the angle ∠EBH = y (between EB and BH). 

But how do these angles relate? Since point B is on line EF (the line BEGF), and line BH makes angle y with EB. Also, line BD is parallel to AG, and we have ∠ABD = 55° - x.

But how to connect these?

Perhaps considering that the sum of angles around point B? Let me think.

At point B, the angles around it include:

- The angle between BA and BG (which is ∠GBA = x).
- The angle between BA and BD (∠ABD = 55° - x).
- The angle between BE (which is the same as BG extended) and BH (∠EBH = y).
- Possibly other angles if there are more lines, but since we have line BD and BH.

Wait, but line BD is one line from B, and BH is another line from B. So depending on the position of D and H, these angles may add up.

Alternatively, if we consider that line BD and BH are both emanating from B, then the angles between them and other lines might be related.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. However, maybe there's a way to relate these angles.

Since BD || AG, and AG is connected to point A. Also, line BH makes angle y with BE (which is the same as BG). Perhaps there's a triangle or another relationship involving y.

But we don't have specific info about y. However, maybe we can find relations between x and y, and then find x.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle BHE or something else. Wait, we have ∠EBH = y, and if we can find other angles in that triangle.

Wait, point H is on line DH, which passes through B. So line DH goes through B and H. Also, since BD is parallel to AG, and BH is connected to H. Maybe there's a way to relate angles involving y and other angles.

Alternatively, since we have multiple angles at point B, perhaps their sum relates to something.

At point B, the angles around it:

Along line BE (which is the same as BG extended), we have angle between BE and BD, which is ∠EBD. Wait, but BD is parallel to AG. Also, the angle between BE and BD is ∠EBD, which could be related to other angles.

Wait, if we consider that BD || AG, then the angle between BE (which is the same as BG) and BD is equal to the angle between BE and AG. Wait, because of the parallel lines. Let me explain.

Since BD || AG, and BE is a transversal cutting both BD and AG. Therefore, the angle between BE and BD at B (∠EBD) is equal to the angle between BE and AG at G (∠AGE). Wait, because they are corresponding angles.

Yes! Since BD || AG, and BE is a transversal. Therefore, ∠EBD corresponds to ∠AGE. Thus, ∠EBD = ∠AGE = 55°.

So ∠EBD = 55°.

Now, at point B, we have several angles:

- ∠GBA = x (between GB and BA)
- ∠ABD = 55° - x (from earlier)
- ∠EBD = 55° (from above)
  
But how do these fit together?

Wait, ∠EBD is the angle between BE and BD at point B. Since BE is the line going from B through E (i.e., the line BG extended), and BD is the line going from B to D. So ∠EBD is the angle between BE and BD at B, which we just determined is 55°.

But also, at point B, the angle between BA and BD is ∠ABD = 55° - x.

Additionally, there's the angle between BA and BG, which is x. So if we consider the full angle around point B, or the angles along the lines.

Let me consider the straight line at point B. Since B is on line BEGF (line BE), and also on line BD and line BH (for angle y). 

Wait, line BD splits into two parts: one going towards D, and the other being BE. Wait, no. At point B, line BD is one line, and line BE is another. But since BD || AG, and BE is a transversal, giving us ∠EBD = 55°.

Now, at point B, the angle between BA and BE is composed of two parts: ∠ABD and ∠DBE?

Wait, no. If I imagine BA going from B to A, and BE going from B to E (along line BEGF), then the angle between BA and BE would depend on the position of A. But we also have ∠GBA = x, which is the angle between GB (which is part of BE) and BA. So ∠GBA = x is the angle between BA and BG (which is part of BE). Therefore, ∠GBA = x is the angle between BA and BE at point B.

But we also have ∠EBD = 55°, which is the angle between BE and BD at point B. So combining these, the total angle between BA and BD would be x + 55°, because from BA to BE is x, and from BE to BD is 55°, totaling x + 55°. But earlier, we had ∠ABD = 55° - x. This suggests a contradiction unless x + 55° = 55° - x → 2x = 0 → x=0, which is impossible.

Wait, this indicates an error in my reasoning. Let me retrace.

Earlier, I said that ∠ABD = ∠BAG because of the parallel lines BD || AG. But maybe that assumption was incorrect.

Wait, BD || AG, and BA is a transversal. So the corresponding angles would be ∠ABD and ∠BAG. So yes, ∠ABD = ∠BAG.

Then, from triangle ABG, ∠AGB = 125°, ∠GBA = x, ∠BAG = ∠ABD. So:

x + ∠ABD + 125° = 180° → ∠ABD = 55° - x.

But also, from the parallel lines, ∠ABD = ∠BAG. So ∠BAG = 55° - x.

However, I also tried to consider the angle at B between BA and BE (which is x) and the angle between BE and BD (which is 55°), leading to the angle between BA and BD being x + 55°. But according to the previous, ∠ABD = 55° - x. So equating these:

x + 55° = 55° - x → 2x = 0 → x=0, which is impossible. So there's a mistake here.

Where did I go wrong? Let me check.

First, the statement that ∠ABD = ∠BAG because of BD || AG. Is that correct?

BD || AG, and BA is a transversal. So the angles formed by BA with BD and AG would be corresponding angles. However, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and BD at B, while ∠BAG is the angle between BA and AG at A. Are these corresponding angles?

No, because corresponding angles are on the same side of the transversal. If BA is the transversal, then for the parallel lines BD and AG, the corresponding angles would be:

At point B: ∠ABD (between BA and BD)

At point A: ∠BAG (between BA and AG)

These are indeed corresponding angles, hence equal. So ∠ABD = ∠BAG.

So that part is correct.

Then, from triangle ABG, ∠BAG = ∠ABD = 55° - x, as derived earlier.

But also, from the other consideration, the angle between BA and BD is x + 55°, which conflicts with ∠ABD = 55° - x. Therefore, there must be an error in the second part.

Let me re-examine the second part.

I said that ∠EBD = 55°, because BD || AG and BE is a transversal. Is that correct?

Yes, because BD || AG, and BE is a transversal, so ∠EBD (at B) corresponds to ∠AGE (at G), which is 55°. So ∠EBD = 55°.

Now, at point B, the angle between BA and BE is ∠GBA = x. The angle between BE and BD is ∠EBD = 55°. So the total angle between BA and BD would be x + 55°, right? Because BA to BE is x, and BE to BD is 55°, so total angle between BA and BD is x + 55°. But earlier, we had ∠ABD = 55° - x. So:

∠ABD = x + 55° = 55° - x → x + 55° = 55° - x → 2x = 0 → x = 0. Contradiction.

This suggests that there's an error in assumptions. Where?

Possibly in the calculation of ∠AGB. Earlier, I assumed that ∠AGB = 180° - ∠AGE = 125°, but maybe that's incorrect.

Let me re-examine ∠AGB. At point G, the angle between AG and BG. Since G is on line BEGF, which is the line containing BE. So line BG is part of this line. So at point G, line AG meets line BG (part of BE). So ∠AGB is the angle between AG and BG at G.

But ∠AGE is the angle between AG and GE at G. Since GE is part of line BG extended in the opposite direction. So ∠AGE and ∠AGB are supplementary, because they form a linear pair. Therefore, ∠AGE + ∠AGB = 180°. Hence, ∠AGB = 180° - 55° = 125°, which is correct.

So that part is correct. Hence, in triangle ABG, angles are x, ∠BAG = 55° - x, and 125°, adding up to 180°.

But this leads to a conflict with the other angle calculation. So where is the mistake?

Maybe the assumption that ∠ABD = x + 55° is incorrect. Let me visualize again.

At point B, line BE is going through G and E. Line BD is going in some direction, making ∠EBD = 55° with BE. Line BA is another line from B, forming angle x with BE (since ∠GBA = x). So the angle between BA and BE is x, and between BE and BD is 55°, so the angle between BA and BD depends on whether BD is on one side or the other of BE.

Wait, if BD is on the same side as BA relative to BE, then the angle between BA and BD would be |x - 55°|. If they are on opposite sides, it would be x + 55°. But without knowing the diagram, it's ambiguous. However, since BD is parallel to AG, which has a certain direction, perhaps the angle is x + 55° or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between BA and BD is ∠ABD = 55° - x, and this angle is also equal to x + 55°, leading to the equation 55° - x = x + 55° → -x = x → x = 0. Still impossible.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the relationship between ∠ABD and ∠BAG might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the parallel lines.

Let me reconsider the parallel lines. BD || AG. Let me think about the transversal BA. When BA intersects BD at B and AG at A, the corresponding angles are ∠ABD and ∠BAG. But if the lines are in a certain orientation, these angles could be on different sides.

Wait, maybe ∠ABD is not equal to ∠BAG, but rather ∠ABD is supplementary to ∠BAG? Or another relationship.

Wait, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

So, if BD || AG, and BA is a transversal, then ∠ABD and ∠BAG are either corresponding or alternate.

But depending on the direction of the lines, it could vary.

Let me try to define the directions:

Imagine line AG going from A to G. Line BD is parallel to AG, so it has the same slope. At point B, line BD starts. Line BA goes from B to A. So, the transversal BA crosses BD at B and AG at A.

The corresponding angles would be the ones on the same side of the transversal. So, if BD and AG are parallel, and BA is the transversal, then ∠ABD (at B) corresponds to ∠BAG (at A). Hence, they should be equal. So ∠ABD = ∠BAG.

But if this leads to inconsistency, maybe the diagram is configured differently. Perhaps the direction of the lines causes the angles to be on different sides, making them supplementary instead of equal.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ∠AGB. Let me double-check.

At point G, ∠AGE is 55°, which is between AG and GE. Since GE is part of line BG (extended from G through E to B). So the angle between AG and GE is ∠AGE = 55°. The angle between AG and GB (which is the same as GE extended in the other direction) would be supplementary to ∠AGE. So ∠AGB = 180° - 55° = 125°, which is correct.

So, returning to the triangle ABG: x + ∠BAG + 125° = 180° → ∠BAG = 55° - x.

And ∠ABD = ∠BAG = 55° - x.

But also, at point B, the angle between BA and BE is x (since ∠GBA = x). The angle between BE and BD is 55° (from the parallel lines). So, if BA and BD are on opposite sides of BE, then the angle between BA and BD would be x + 55°. If they are on the same side, it would be |x - 55°|.

But since ∠ABD is defined as the angle between BA and BD, it should be equal to 55° - x. So:

Case 1: If BA and BD are on opposite sides of BE, then ∠ABD = x + 55° = 55° - x → x = 0, invalid.

Case 2: If BA and BD are on the same side of BE, then ∠ABD = |x - 55°| = 55° - x. This implies that x ≤ 55°, and the absolute value becomes x - 55° if x ≥ 55°, or 55° - x otherwise. But since we have ∠ABD = 55° - x, it suggests that x ≤ 55°, and the angle is 55° - x. But how does this relate to the other angle?

Wait, if BA and BD are on the same side of BE, then the angle between BA and BD would be 55° - x, which matches ∠ABD = 55° - x. But how does this relate to the other angles?

Wait, if BA and BD are on the same side of BE, then the angle between BA and BE is x, and the angle between BE and BD is 55°, but since they are on the same side, the angle between BA and BD would be 55° - x. Wait, that makes sense! For example, if you have two angles on the same side, the difference would be the angle between the two lines.

Yes! So if at point B, BA and BE form an angle of x, and BE and BD form an angle of 55°, and both BA and BD are on the same side of BE, then the angle between BA and BD is 55° - x. Hence, ∠ABD = 55° - x, which matches our earlier calculation. So no contradiction!

Ah! My earlier mistake was assuming that the angle between BA and BD was x + 55°, but it's actually 55° - x if they are on the same side. So this resolves the contradiction.

So, this confirms that ∠ABD = 55° - x, and this comes from the angle between BA and BD being 55° - x. 

Now, what else can we do with this?

We also have the angle ∠EBH = y at point B. How is this related?

At point B, we have several lines: BE (which is the same as BG), BD, BH, and BA. The angle ∠EBH = y is between BE and BH. Since BH is another line from B, making angle y with BE.

If we can relate this angle y to other angles, perhaps we can find x.

But how? Let's consider the lines and possible triangles.

Since point H is on line DH, which passes through B, and we have ∠EBH = y. Also, since BD is parallel to AG, and we have other angles.

Maybe considering triangle BHE or something else. But without more info, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since we have ∠ABD = 55° - x, and ∠ABD is part of the angle at B, which may relate to ∠EBH = y.

Wait, if line BH is part of line DH, and BD is part of line DH, then BH and BD are parts of the same line DH. Wait, no. Point B is on line DH, so DH is a single line passing through B. So line BH is part of line DH. So, ∠EBH is the angle between BE and BH, where BH is along line DH.

Since line DH contains point B and is parallel to AG, and we have ∠ABD = 55° - x, which is the angle between BA and BD (which is along DH). So, ∠ABD is the angle between BA and DH at B, which is 55° - x.

But ∠EBH is the angle between BE and BH (which is along DH). So, ∠EBH is the angle between BE and DH at B. But since DH is the same line as BD, ∠EBH is the same as ∠EBD, which we previously determined as 55°. Wait, but earlier we said ∠EBD = 55°, which is the angle between BE and BD. So ∠EBH = ∠EBD = 55°? But the problem states that ∠EBH = y, so y = 55°? But that would mean y = 55°, but we aren't asked about y. However, this might be useful.

Wait, if ∠EBH = y, and ∠EBD = 55°, and BH is along DH, then unless BH is in a particular position, y could be related to other angles.

Wait, but if line DH is the same as line BD, then ∠EBH is the same as ∠EBD, which is 55°, so y = 55°. But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe there's another relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involving y.

Wait, if I consider triangle BHE, but I don't have enough information. Alternatively, since BD || AG, and if we can find a relationship between y and x.

Wait, let me think. At point B, we have angles:

- Between BA and BE: x
- Between BE and BD: 55°
- Between BE and BH: y
- Between BD and BH: ? (depending on the direction)

But since BH is along DH, and BD is part of DH, then the angle between BD and BH is zero? No, because BH is along DH, so ∠DBH is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if B is on line DH, then BH is a part of line DH. So, if we have line DH passing through B, then BH is a ray from B along DH. So, if we consider ∠EBH, it's the angle between BE and BH, where BH is along DH. And since BD is parallel to AG, and line DH contains BD, then ∠EBH is the same as ∠EBD, which is 55°, so y = 55°. Hence, y = 55°.

But the problem gives us that ∠EBH = y, and asks for x. So if y = 55°, how does that help?

Wait, maybe there's another relationship involving y. Let me think about triangle BHE or something else.

Alternatively, since we have parallel lines BD || AG, and line BH making an angle y with BE. If we can find some relationship between y and other angles.

Alternatively, since we have ∠ABD = 55° - x, and if we can relate this to y.

Wait, at point B, the angles around it:

- ∠GBA = x
- ∠ABD = 55° - x
- ∠EBH = y
- And possibly others.

But unless we know more about the configuration, it's hard to say. However, since we have BD || AG, and line BH is along DH, which contains BD, maybe there's a way to relate y to other angles.

Wait, if we consider triangle ABG, we have ∠BAG = 55° - x, and if there's a way to connect this to y.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point B is 360°, but since we're dealing with straight lines, it's likely that the angles sum to 180° or something similar.

Wait, at point B, the angles on one side of the line BE would be x (between BA and BE) and 55° (between BE and BD), plus any other angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's still unclear.

But if we assume that all these angles are on the same plane and the diagram is simple, maybe there's a way to find x.

Wait, let's recap:

From triangle ABG, we have ∠BAG = 55° - x.

From the parallel lines, ∠ABD = ∠BAG = 55° - x.

At point B, the angle between BE and BD is 55°, and the angle between BA and BE is x. Assuming these are on the same side, the angle between BA and BD is 55° - x, which matches ∠ABD = 55° - x.

Now, if we can relate ∠BAG (which is 55° - x) to something else.

But ∠BAG is the angle at A between BA and AG. Let me consider triangle AGB, but we already used that.

Alternatively, since AG is parallel to BD, and if we can find a transversal involving AG and BD, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the entire diagram. Points A, G, E are connected, with ∠AGE = 55°. Point B is connected to E, G, and H. Line BD is parallel to AG.

Maybe considering triangle AEG and some other triangle?

Alternatively, since AG || BD, and if there's a parallelogram or something.

Wait, if I consider translating line AG to BD, since they're parallel. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult.

Wait, let me consider the possibility that x is 55°, but that would make ∠BAG = 0°, which is impossible. Or x = 115°, which would make ∠BAG = 55° - 115° = -60°, which is impossible. So x must be less than 55°, since ∠BAG must be positive.

Wait, ∠BAG = 55° - x > 0 → x < 55°. So x must be less than 55°.

Looking at the answer choices: A. 55, B. 115, C. 125, D. 135. None of these are less than 55 except none. Wait, this suggests a problem.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 55, B. 115, C. 125, D. 135. But according to our analysis, x must be less than 55°, but none of the options are below 55. This suggests a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, this indicates a critical error. Let me revisit the assumption that ∠AGB = 125°. Let me recheck this.

At point G, ∠AGE = 55°, which is between AG and GE. GE is part of line BEGF, so line GE is the same as line BG extended from G through E. So, at point G, line AG and line GE form an angle of 55°. The line BG is part of this line GE, so the angle between AG and BG at G is the supplement of ∠AGE, because they are on a straight line. Wait, no. If you stand at point G, with AG going one way and GE going the other (towards E), then the angle between AG and GE is 55°, and the angle between AG and BG (which is the same as GE extended in the opposite direction) would be 180° - 55° = 125°. So ∠AGB = 125°, which is correct.

So in triangle ABG, angles are x, 55° - x, and 125°, summing to 180°. So:

x + (55° - x) + 125° = 180° → 55° + 125° = 180° → 180° = 180°. Wait, this is an identity! It doesn't give us any new information. This means that our earlier equations are consistent but don't allow us to solve for x. This suggests that there's missing information, or that x can be any value, which contradicts the problem stating that x has a specific value.

This indicates that there's a missing piece of information or a misstep in the logic.

Let me think differently. Perhaps there's a relationship involving the angle y.

Since we have ∠EBH = y, and from earlier, we deduced that ∠EBD = 55°, which is the same as ∠EBH = y. Wait, if BH is along line DH, which contains BD, then ∠EBH is the same as ∠EBD, so y = 55°. Hence, y = 55°.

But how does this help us find x?

If y = 55°, and if there's a triangle or other relationship involving y and x, we could use it.

For example, if we consider triangle EBH, but without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since BD || AG, and if there's a transversal creating some angles.

Wait, let's consider line BH, which makes angle y = 55° with BE. If we can relate this to other angles.

At point B, we have ∠GBA = x, ∠EBH = y = 55°, and ∠ABD = 55° - x.

If we consider the line BH, which makes angle y = 55° with BE, and if there's a relationship between this angle and other angles at B.

But without additional information, it's hard to proceed. Maybe considering the sum of angles around point B.

At point B, the angles around it include:

- Along line BE: angles with BA (x), with BD (55°), and with BH (y = 55°). But this depends on the arrangement.

If we assume that BA, BD, and BH are all on the same side of BE, then the sum of angles would be x + 55° + 55° = ... but this seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through B, like line BF, which contains G and F, and other lines.

Wait, since point B is on line EF, which is the same as line BEGF, and line BH is another line from B. If we consider that line BH makes an angle y = 55° with BE, and line BD makes an angle 55° with BE, then maybe BH and BD are the same line? But that would imply that y = 55°, which we already have, but it doesn't help us find x.

Alternatively, if line BH is the same as line BD, then y = 55°, but this is already accounted for.

This suggests that the problem might require another approach.

Let me try to consider the entire figure again, focusing on the parallel lines and angles.

Since BD || AG, and if we can find a transversal that creates corresponding angles or something.

Consider line BG, which intersects BD at B and AG at G. As before, ∠ABD = ∠BAG = 55° - x.

But we also have ∠AGE = 55°, which is at G.

Is there a way to relate ∠BAG to ∠AGE?

Maybe through some triangle or parallel lines.

Wait, if we extend AG to meet BH or something. But without knowing where H is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, since AG || BD, and if we can find a triangle where these lines are sides.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABG and triangle DB... something.

Wait, if I consider triangle ABD, but I don't know much about it.

Alternatively, since BD || AG, the distance between these lines is constant, but this might not help.

Wait, let's think about the exterior angle theorem. In triangle ABG, ∠AGB = 125°, and ∠AGB is an external angle to some other triangle.

Wait, if we consider line GH, but I don't know where H is.

Alternatively, since ∠AGB = 125°, and if there's a line from G making some angle with it.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me try to look for alternative approaches.

Let me consider assigning coordinates to the points to calculate the angles.

Let me place point G at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.

Since AG is a line, let me set A at some point, say, A(0, b) for some b, so that AG is vertical. But since AG is parallel to BD, which would mean BD is also vertical.

But this might complicate things. Let me try.

Let me set G at (0, 0).

Since AG is a line, let me assume AG is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set A at (-a, 0) and G at (0, 0), so AG is from A(-a, 0) to G(0, 0), making it horizontal.

Since BD is parallel to AG, BD is also horizontal.

Now, line BE passes through G(0, 0) and E. Since BE is part of line BEGF, and B is on line BE. Let me set E at (e, 0), so line BE is the x-axis from B to E to G to F.

Wait, but G is at (0, 0), and E is at (e, 0). So BE is the x-axis. Point B is on line BE, so it has coordinates (b, 0), where b is some value.

But since G is on line BE, and G is at (0, 0), and E is at (e, 0), then B must be on the line BE, which is the x-axis. Let me assume B is at (-k, 0) for some k > 0, so that B is to the left of G.

Now, line BD is parallel to AG, which is horizontal. So BD is horizontal. Since B is at (-k, 0), and BD is horizontal, D is somewhere along the horizontal line through B, so D has coordinates (-k, d) for some d.

Line DH passes through B and D, so it's the horizontal line y = 0 (wait, no: if B is at (-k, 0) and D is at (-k, d), then line BD is vertical, not horizontal. Wait, I made a mistake.

If AG is horizontal (from A(-a, 0) to G(0, 0)), then BD must also be horizontal. So BD is horizontal, meaning it has the same y-coordinate as B. Since B is on line BE, which is the x-axis (assuming BE is the x-axis), then B is at (b, 0). So to make BD horizontal, D must be at (d, 0), but that would make BD part of the x-axis, which is the same as BE, which would mean BD is collinear with BE, but this might not be allowed. Alternatively, if AG is horizontal, then BD is horizontal, so if B is at (b, 0), then D is at (b, d) for some d ≠ 0, making BD vertical? No, if BD is horizontal, then D must be at (b + t, 0) for some t, making BD part of the x-axis. But this would make BD overlap with BE, which might not be intended.

This suggests that my coordinate system assumption is causing confusion. Let me try a different approach.

Let me set point G at (0, 0), and since AG is a line, let me set A at (0, a) so that AG is vertical. Then BD is parallel to AG, so BD is also vertical.

Point B is on line BE, which passes through G. Let me assume BE is a line passing through G(0, 0) and E. Let me set E at (1, 0), so BE is the x-axis. Then G is at (0, 0), and E is at (1, 0). Line BE is the x-axis.

Point B is on line BE, so it's somewhere on the x-axis. Let me set B at (-1, 0), so that BE is from B(-1, 0) through G(0, 0) to E(1, 0).

Now, BD is parallel to AG, which is vertical (from A(0, a) to G(0, 0)). So BD must also be vertical. Since B is at (-1, 0), line BD is vertical, so D is at (-1, d) for some d.

Now, line DH passes through B and D, so it's the vertical line x = -1. Point H is on this line.

Now, ∠EBH = y is the angle at B between E and H. Since E is at (1, 0) and B is at (-1, 0), the line BE is the x-axis. Line BH goes from B(-1, 0) to H, which is on line DH (vertical line x=-1). So H is at (-1, h). The angle ∠EBH is the angle between BE (x-axis) and BH (vertical line upwards or downwards from B).

If H is above B, then ∠EBH is 90°, since BE is x-axis and BH is vertical. If H is below, it's also 90°. But the problem states ∠EBH = y, so y = 90°. But this is a specific case, but in general, it depends on H's position.

However, in this setup, BD is vertical (parallel to AG), and we can calculate other angles.

Now, let's find x, which is ∠GBA. Point G is at (0, 0), B is at (-1, 0), and A is at (0, a). So ∠GBA is the angle at B between G and A.

Vector BG is from B to G: (0 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (1, 0).

Vector BA is from B to A: (0 - (-1), a - 0) = (1, a).

The angle between vectors BG (1, 0) and BA (1, a) is x.

Using the dot product:

cos(x) = (BG · BA) / (|BG| |BA|) = (1*1 + 0*a)/ (1 * sqrt(1^2 + a^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + a²).

So x = arccos(1 / sqrt(1 + a²)).

But we also know that ∠AGE = 55°. Let's calculate ∠AGE.

Point A is (0, a), G is (0, 0), E is (1, 0). So ∠AGE is the angle at G between A and E.

Vectors GA and GE:

GA is from G to A: (0 - 0, a - 0) = (0, a).

GE is from G to E: (1 - 0, 0 - 0) = (1, 0).

The angle between GA (0, a) and GE (1, 0) is ∠AGE.

Using dot product:

cos(∠AGE) = (GA · GE) / (|GA| |GE|) = (0*1 + a*0) / (a * 1) = 0 / a = 0.

So ∠AGE is 90°, but the problem states it's 55°. This contradicts our setup, so our assumption about the coordinates is flawed.

This suggests that placing AG vertically and BE horizontally led to ∠AGE = 90°, but it should be 55°. To fix this, we need to adjust the coordinates.

Let me try a different approach. Let me set G at (0, 0), and let AG make an angle such that ∠AGE = 55°.

Let me assume that point E is at (1, 0), and point G is at (0, 0). Let me choose point A such that ∠AGE = 55°.

Vector GE is from G to E: (1, 0).

Vector GA is from G to A: let's say A is at (cosθ, sinθ) to make ∠AGE = θ. Wait, if I want ∠AGE = 55°, then θ = 55°. So let me set A at (cos55°, sin55°). So GA makes 55° with GE.

Now, AG is from G(0, 0) to A(cos55°, sin55°). BD is parallel to AG, so BD has the same slope as AG.

Point B is on line BE, which passes through G(0, 0) and E(1, 0). Let me set B at (-1, 0) for simplicity, so line BE is the x-axis.

Since BD is parallel to AG, which has slope (sin55° - 0)/(cos55° - 0) = tan55°. So BD has slope tan55°.

Point B is at (-1, 0), so line BD is the line through B with slope tan55°. Its equation is y - 0 = tan55°(x + 1).

Now, let's find ∠GBA, which is the angle at B between G and A.

Point G is at (0, 0), B is at (-1, 0), and A is at (cos55°, sin55°).

Vector BG is from B to G: (0 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (1, 0).

Vector BA is from B to A: (cos55° - (-1), sin50° - 0) = (1 + cos55°, sin55°).

The angle x between BG (1, 0) and BA (1 + cos55°, sin55°) can be calculated using the dot product:

cos(x) = (1*(1 + cos55°) + 0*sin55°) / (|BG| * |BA|)

|BG| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1.

|BA| = sqrt((1 + cos55°)^2 + (sin55°)^2) = sqrt(1 + 2cos55° + cos²55° + sin²55°) = sqrt(2 + 2cos55°), since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

So cos(x) = (1 + cos55°) / sqrt(2 + 2cos55°) = (1 + cos55°) / [sqrt(2(1 + cos55°))] = sqrt(1 + cos55°)/sqrt(2).

Using the identity 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2), so:

cos(x) = sqrt(2cos²(55°/2)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*|cos(27.5°)| / sqrt(2) = |cos(27.5°)|.

Since 27.5° is acute, cos(27.5°) is positive, so x = 27.5°.

But 27.5° is not one of the answer choices. The closest option is A. 55, but 27.5 is half of 55. This suggests that the actual value of x is 27.5°, but since it's not an option, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me verify the calculation:

cos(x) = (1 + cos55°) / sqrt(2 + 2cos55°) = (1 + cos55°) / [sqrt(2(1 + cos55°))] = sqrt(1 + cos55°) / sqrt(2) = sqrt[(1 + cos55°)/2] = cos(55°/2).

Because cos(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 + cosθ)/2]. So x = 55°/2 = 27.5°, which is correct.

But this is not one of the answer choices. The options are 55, 115, 125, 135. This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem setup or in the assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠AGE is not 55°, but the calculation assumes it is. But according to the problem, it is 55°.

This indicates that my coordinate approach might not align with the problem's constraints, or there's an error in the assumptions.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should reconsider the original equations.

From earlier, in triangle ABG, we have:

x + (55° - x) + 125° = 180°, which is always true, so it doesn't help.

But if we consider that ∠BAG = 55° - x, and this angle is related to y.

Since ∠EBH = y = 55° (as derived earlier), and if there's a relationship between ∠BAG and y.

If we assume that ∠BAG + y = 180°, or some other relationship.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line or supplementary angles.

Wait, if line AG is parallel to BD, and if there's a transversal creating an angle with y.

For example, if line BH is a transversal, and since BD || AG, then the angle between BH and BD is equal to the angle between BH and AG.

But ∠EBH = y is the angle between BE and BH. If BE is a transversal, and AG is parallel to BD, then maybe there's a relationship.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, if ∠BAG = y, but this is just guessing.

If I assume ∠BAG = y, then 55° - x = y. But we also have from earlier that y = 55°, so 55° - x = 55° → x = 0, which is invalid.

Alternatively, if ∠BAG + y = 180°, then 55° - x + y = 180°. But without knowing y, this is not helpful.

Since the problem provides answer choices, and the only way to get a valid x is if there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Let me revisit the initial assumption about ∠AGB = 125°. What if it's not 125°?

Wait, ∠AGE = 55°, which is at G between A and E. If line GE is part of line BE, then ∠AGE is the angle between AG and GE. If line BE is extended beyond G to F, then ∠AGB is the angle between AG and BG, which is the same as ∠AGE if BG is in the same direction as GE. But if BG is in the opposite direction, it would be supplementary.

Wait, if line BE passes through G, and B is on the extension of BE beyond G, then line BG is in the opposite direction of GE. So at point G, ∠AGE is between AG and GE, and ∠AGB is between AG and GB, which is supplementary to ∠AGE.

So ∠AGB = 180° - 55° = 125°, which is correct.

But if this is the case, then in triangle ABG, x + ∠BAG + 125° = 180°, so x + ∠BAG = 55°.

But ∠BAG = 55° - x, as before.

This leads to x + (55° - x) = 55°, which is always true, giving no new information.

This suggests that the problem is under-constrained, and x can be any value, but this is impossible.

Given that the answer choices are fixed, and the only possible way to get a value is if there's a missing constraint, like the sum of angles at B or something.

Wait, let's consider that at point B, the angles around it must sum to 360°, but since we're dealing with a plane, the sum of angles around a point is 360°. But if we consider the angles on one side of a line, it sums to 180°.

At point B, we have line BE (or BG) and lines BA, BD, BH.

If we assume that the angles on one side of BE are x (between BA and BE), 55° (between BE and BD), and y (between BE and BH), then x + 55° + y = 180°, assuming they are all on the same side.

But we earlier concluded that y = 55°, so x + 55° + 55° = 180° → x = 70°, which is not an option.

But this is assuming that all three angles are on the same side of BE, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, if some angles are on one side and others on the other, it could be different.

If x and y are on one side, and 55° on the other, then x + y = 55°, but without knowing y, this is not helpful.

But if y = 55°, then x + 55° = 55° → x = 0, which is invalid.

This suggests that the only way this works is if there's an error in the problem or in the assumptions.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common angles.

Since ∠AGE = 55°, and if x is supplementary to it, x = 125°, which is option C. Or if it's complementary, 125° is supplementary to 55°, but that would be 125°, which is option C.

Alternatively, since ∠AGB = 125°, and if x is part of a triangle with it, maybe x = 125°, but that would make the other angle negative.

Wait, if x = 125°, then in triangle ABG, ∠BAG =
