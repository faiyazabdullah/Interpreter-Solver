====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral WXYZ which is a rectangle. The question asks for the measure of angle 3, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles. 

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle measures 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions several angles labeled 1 through 12, so maybe these aren't the internal angles of the rectangle? Or perhaps they are related to some triangles formed within the rectangle?

Let me parse the given constraints again. There are multiple equalities between different angles and points lying on lines. Also, there's a perpendicularity condition between lines YZ and YW. Hmm. Since it's stated that WXYZ is a rectangle, I can assume that sides WX, XY, YZ, and ZW are all straight lines forming right angles at each vertex. Wait, but the labels might not be in order? Or maybe they are in order? Let me think about how the quadrilateral is structured.

The points mentioned are W, X, Y, Z. If WXYZ is a rectangle, then the vertices should be connected as W-X-Y-Z-W, forming a rectangle. However, the problem also includes points A, which lies on lines ZW and YX. So point A is somewhere along those lines. Also, there's a perpendicular line between YZ and YW. That suggests that line YZ is perpendicular to line YW. Since YZ is a side of the rectangle (assuming standard labeling), and YW would be a diagonal or another line?

Wait, let me sketch mentally. Suppose we have rectangle WXYZ. Let me label the rectangle such that W is connected to X and Z, X is connected to Y, Y is connected to Z, and Z back to W. Now, point A lies on both lines ZW and YX. So line ZW is one of the sides of the rectangle, and line YX is another side. Therefore, point A is the intersection of these two lines? Wait, but in a rectangle, lines ZW and YX are opposite sides. Unless they are extended beyond their endpoints, but since A is a point lying on both lines, maybe A is the intersection of the diagonals? Wait, no, because in a rectangle, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint. But if A is on both ZW and YX, then unless those lines are extended. Wait, but in a rectangle, sides ZW and YX are parallel. Because opposite sides are parallel. So if A is on both lines ZW and YX, then they must be the same line? No, that can't be. Unless the lines are extended. For example, if we extend side ZW beyond W and side YX beyond X, they might meet at some point A? But the problem states that PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z, W)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X)). So A lies on both lines ZW and YX. Which implies that lines ZW and YX intersect at A. But in a rectangle, lines ZW and YX are opposite sides; hence, they are parallel and do not intersect unless the rectangle is degenerate. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Unless the lines are not the sides themselves but the entire lines. Wait, maybe lines ZW and YX are considered as infinite lines, so even though they are parallel as sides, their extensions could meet at a point? No, because in Euclidean geometry, two distinct parallel lines never meet. Hence, there's a contradiction here. Maybe my assumption about the labeling of the rectangle is incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle isn't labeled in order? Like W, X, Y, Z arranged differently. Let me consider another possibility. Suppose the rectangle has vertices W, X, Y, Z arranged such that lines WX, XY, YZ, and ZW form the rectangle. Then, lines ZW and YX would be adjacent sides? Wait, no. If W is connected to X and Z, then line ZW is one side, and line YX is another side. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if line ZW is one side and line YX is another side, then they would meet at a corner. Wait, but if A lies on both lines ZW and YX, then A must be at the intersection of those two lines. Which would mean that lines ZW and YX intersect at A, implying that they are not parallel. But in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So lines ZW and YX would be opposite sides, hence parallel. Thus, they cannot intersect unless they are the same line, which they aren't. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Perhaps the problem uses a different configuration?

Wait, maybe the labels are not in order. Let me try to visualize again. Suppose the rectangle is WXYZ with points W, X, Y, Z arranged such that W is connected to X and Z, X is connected to Y, Y is connected to Z, and Z back to W. Then, line ZW is part of the rectangle, going from Z to W. Line YX goes from Y to X. These are two sides of the rectangle. Are they parallel? Yes, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, lines ZW and YX are parallel. Hence, they cannot intersect unless they are the same line. Therefore, point A cannot lie on both lines unless it's at infinity, which isn't possible. This suggests that my initial understanding of the rectangle's structure is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not convex? Or maybe A is not inside the rectangle? Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z,W)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y,X)). So A is on both lines, which are ZW and YX. Therefore, A must be the intersection point of those two lines. But if they are parallel, they don't intersect. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if lines ZW and YX are not parallel. Which would imply that the figure is not a rectangle? But the problem says Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the lines are not the sides of the rectangle but something else. Let me check the original problem again. It says "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle." So the four points W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. Then, the lines referred to are Line(Z, W) and Line(Y, X). So Line(Z, W) is the side connecting Z to W, and Line(Y, X) connects Y to X. In a rectangle, these two lines are opposite sides. So they should be parallel. Therefore, unless they are extended beyond their endpoints, but even then, they remain parallel. Therefore, they can't intersect. So this suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the configuration. 

But since this is a math problem, there must be a way to make sense of it. Let me think again. Perhaps the lines are not just the sides but include other lines? For example, maybe Line(Y, X) refers to the extension of the side YX beyond X? Similarly, Line(Z, W) refers to the extension of ZW beyond W. Then, if those extended lines intersect at point A. But in that case, A would be outside the rectangle. 

For instance, suppose we have rectangle WXYZ. Extend side ZW beyond W to a point A, and extend side YX beyond X to a point A. Then, point A is the intersection of these two extended lines. But in that case, depending on the rectangle's proportions, the position of A varies. However, without knowing specific lengths, maybe we can use the given angles. 

Also, there's a Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z), Line(Y,W)). So line YZ is perpendicular to line YW. Let me think about this. If YZ is a side of the rectangle, then line YZ is horizontal or vertical, depending on orientation. Line YW would be from Y to W. If YZ is perpendicular to YW, then triangle YZW is a right-angled triangle at Y. 

So, considering that, maybe triangle YZW is right-angled at Y. Therefore, angle at Y between YZ and YW is 90 degrees. But since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle at Y is already 90 degrees. Wait, in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So angle at Y between sides YZ and YX is 90 degrees. But the problem says that line YZ is perpendicular to line YW. Therefore, line YW is perpendicular to YZ, which means that YW is a line from Y to W, making a right angle with YZ. But in the rectangle, YZ is one side, and YX is another side. So line YW would be a diagonal? Because from Y to W. 

Yes! In the rectangle, the diagonal from Y to W would split the rectangle into two congruent triangles. And since YZ is one side, and YW is the diagonal, then YZ is perpendicular to YW? Wait, that would only happen if the rectangle is a square? Because in general, the diagonal of a rectangle isn't perpendicular to the sides unless it's a square. 

Ah! So if YZ is perpendicular to YW, then triangle YZW is a right-angled isoceles triangle? Because if YZ is perpendicular to YW, and YZ is a side of the rectangle, then YW is the diagonal. Therefore, the length of YZ equals the length of YW? Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

In a rectangle, the length of the diagonal can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem: sqrt(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. For the diagonal YW to be perpendicular to YZ, which is a side, then the slope of YW must be undefined (if YZ is horizontal) or zero (if YZ is vertical). Wait, but if YZ is a vertical side, then YW would need to be horizontal to be perpendicular. But YW is a diagonal from Y to W. Let me assign coordinates to make this clearer. 

Let me place the rectangle on coordinate axes. Let me assume that point Y is at (0, 0). Since YZ is a side of the rectangle, let's say YZ is vertical. Then, point Z would be at (0, h), where h is the height. Then, since it's a rectangle, point X would be at (w, 0), where w is the width. Then, point W would be at (w, h). Now, line YZ is from Y(0,0) to Z(0,h), which is vertical. Line YW is from Y(0,0) to W(w, h). The slope of YW is (h - 0)/(w - 0) = h/w. For YZ (vertical) to be perpendicular to YW, the product of their slopes must be -1. However, the slope of YZ is undefined (since it's vertical), so the line YW must be horizontal. But a horizontal line would have slope 0. Therefore, for YW to be horizontal, h must be 0, which would collapse the rectangle into a line. Contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that my coordinate assumption is flawed. 

Alternatively, maybe YZ is horizontal. Let me adjust. Let me take point Y at (0, 0), and YZ horizontal to Z( l, 0 ). Then, since it's a rectangle, point X would be at (0, w), and point W would be at (l, w). Then, line YZ is from Y(0,0) to Z(l, 0), which is horizontal. Line YW is from Y(0,0) to W(l, w). Slope of YW is w/l. For YZ (horizontal) to be perpendicular to YW, the slope of YW must be vertical (undefined), which would require l=0, again collapsing the rectangle. Not possible. 

Therefore, this suggests that in a general rectangle, line YZ cannot be perpendicular to YW. Therefore, the given constraint that Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z), Line(Y,W)) implies that the rectangle must have specific proportions. Wait, unless the rectangle is actually a square? Let me check. If it's a square, then the diagonal YW would have slope 1 if YZ is horizontal. Then, the slope of YZ is 0, and slope of YW is 1. Their product is 0*1=0 ≠ -1. Still not perpendicular. So that doesn't work. 

Wait, unless the lines are not sides but something else. Maybe YW is not a diagonal but another line? Wait, in the rectangle, W is connected to Z and X. So line YW connects Y to W, which is indeed a diagonal. So the problem states that Line(Y,Z) is perpendicular to Line(Y,W). But in a rectangle, this can only happen if the rectangle is degenerate, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my assumptions. 

Perhaps the rectangle is not axis-aligned, and the lines are not sides but other lines? Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me try a different approach. 

Given that there are multiple angles labeled 1 through 12, and relationships between them. Maybe instead of focusing on the rectangle directly, I should focus on the angles and see if I can find relations. 

We are told that m∠1 = 30°, and need to find m∠3. The angles are defined based on various points. Let me list all the given angle equalities:

1. ∠WAX = ∠11
2. ∠AWY = ∠7
3. ∠WYA = ∠6
4. ∠XWZ = ∠8
5. ∠XAZ = ∠10
6. ∠YAW = ∠9
7. ∠WZX = ∠3
8. ∠XAW = ∠1
9. ∠XYZ = ∠5
10. ∠YAZ = ∠4
11. ∠ZA Y = ∠12
12. ∠ZXY = ∠2

Additionally, Point A lies on Line(ZW) and Line(YX). Also, Line(YZ) ⊥ Line(YW).

Since WXYZ is a rectangle, maybe we can assign coordinates to the points to calculate the angles. Let me attempt that. Let's assume coordinates for the rectangle. Let me define:

Let’s place point W at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, we can set up coordinates accordingly. Let me assume that:

- Point W is at (0, 0)
- Point X is at (a, 0) for some a > 0
- Point Y is at (a, b) for some b > 0
- Point Z is at (0, b)

This forms a rectangle with sides WX = a, WZ = b, etc.

Now, point A lies on Line(ZW) and Line(YX). Let me determine equations for these lines.

Line ZW connects Z(0, b) to W(0, 0). This is the vertical line x=0.

Line YX connects Y(a, b) to X(a, 0). This is the vertical line x=a.

Wait, so Line(ZW) is x=0 (from (0,b) to (0,0)), and Line(YX) is x=a (from (a,b) to (a,0)). These are two vertical lines, parallel, separated by distance a. Therefore, they do not intersect. Hence, point A cannot exist on both lines unless... unless the lines are not the segments but the entire lines. But even then, two distinct vertical lines don't intersect. Hence, this suggests that there's an inconsistency. 

Wait, but the problem states that PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z, W)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X)). So maybe the lines are not the sides but other lines? Or maybe the labels are different? For example, maybe Line(Z, W) is not the side from Z to W but another line? Or maybe I made a mistake in assigning coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me try another labeling. Suppose the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z arranged clockwise, but with different connections. For example, maybe W is connected to X and Y, while Z is connected to X and Y? No, that would not form a rectangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is WXYZ with W connected to X and Z, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, and Z connected to W. So the rectangle has vertices W, X, Y, Z in order. Then, Line(ZW) is from Z to W, and Line(YX) is from Y to X. As before, these are two sides of the rectangle, which are parallel. Hence, they don't intersect. 

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

It says: "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle." So W, X, Y, Z are the four vertices of the rectangle. Then, "PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z, W))" and "PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X))". So A lies on both lines ZW and YX. Since these lines are sides of the rectangle, which are parallel, this is only possible if the lines are the same line, which they are not. Hence, this suggests that the problem may involve extending the lines beyond their endpoints. 

For example, Line(ZW) extends infinitely in both directions, and Line(YX) extends infinitely. So, if we extend Line(ZW) beyond W and Line(YX) beyond X, they might meet at point A. Similarly, extending Line(ZW) beyond Z and Line(YX) beyond Y. But since the lines are parallel, they won't meet unless they are the same line. 

Wait, but if we consider the entire lines, including their extensions, then Line(ZW) and Line(YX) are still parallel, so they never meet. Hence, no such point A exists. This suggests there's a fundamental error in the problem setup, or my understanding is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not the sides but other lines. For example, Line(Z, W) could refer to the diagonal from Z to W? But in a rectangle, the diagonals are from W to Y and X to Z. Wait, if the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z, then the diagonals are WY and XZ. So Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z to W, which would be one of the diagonals. Similarly, Line(Y, X) is the side from Y to X. 

If that's the case, then Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z to W, and Line(Y, X) is the side from Y to X. These two lines might intersect at point A. Let me explore this possibility. 

Assuming that Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z to W, and Line(Y, X) is the side from Y to X. Let me assign coordinates again. Let me take the rectangle with W at (0, 0), X at (a, 0), Y at (a, b), Z at (0, b). Then, Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z(0, b) to W(0, 0)? No, that's the vertical line x=0. Wait, no, if Z is at (0, b) and W is at (0, 0), then Line(Z, W) is the vertical line x=0. Line(Y, X) is from Y(a, b) to X(a, 0), which is vertical line x=a. Again, parallel lines, no intersection. 

Alternatively, if Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z to W, which in this case would be from Z(0, b) to W(0, 0), which is the same as the side ZW. So that brings us back to the previous issue. 

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem involves multiple angles and their measures, maybe I can relate them using triangle properties, given the perpendicularity condition. 

The problem states that Line(YZ) is perpendicular to Line(YW). So, at point Y, the line YZ is perpendicular to YW. In the rectangle, YZ is one side, and YW is a diagonal. As previously discussed, this would only happen if the rectangle has certain proportions. Let me consider that scenario. 

Let me assume that in the rectangle, the diagonal YW is perpendicular to the side YZ. Let's denote the rectangle's sides as follows: Let YZ be of length 'a', and YX be of length 'b'. Then, the diagonal YW has length sqrt(a² + b²). For YW to be perpendicular to YZ, the vector representing YW must be perpendicular to the vector representing YZ. 

Vector YZ would be from Y to Z, which in the rectangle would be along the direction of the side. Let's say Y is at (0, 0), Z is at (a, 0), X is at (0, b), and W is at (a, b). Then, vector YZ is (a, 0), and vector YW is (a, b). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero: (a)(a) + (0)(b) = a² + 0 = a². For this to be zero, a must be zero, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that in a standard rectangle, YZ and YW cannot be perpendicular. Therefore, the only way for this to hold is if the rectangle is degenerate, which it isn't. Hence, there must be an alternative interpretation. 

Maybe the lines YZ and YW are not sides but other lines. For example, if Line(YZ) is not the side but another line. Wait, the problem says "Perpendicular(Line(Y, Z), Line(Y, W))", so it's the lines from Y to Z and from Y to W. In the rectangle, YZ is a side, and YW is a diagonal. As shown earlier, this is impossible unless it's a degenerate rectangle. 

This suggests that the given conditions might not be consistent with a rectangle, but the problem states that WXYZ is a rectangle. Hence, there must be a different configuration. 

Let me try assuming that WXYZ is a rectangle, but with point A being the intersection of the diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other. So if A is the intersection point of diagonals, then A lies on both diagonals. But the problem says A lies on Line(Z, W) and Line(Y, X). If Line(Z, W) is one diagonal, and Line(Y, X) is another diagonal? Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are WY and XZ. So Line(Z, W) is diagonal ZW, which is the same as diagonal WZ. Line(Y, X) is side YX. So unless Line(Y, X) is also a diagonal, which it isn't. 

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo, and Line(Y, X) should be Line(Y, Z)? Or another line? Alternatively, maybe the perpendicular condition is between different lines. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is not a standard rectangle but a different type of quadrilateral, but the problem says it is a rectangle. 

At this point, I'm struggling to reconcile the given conditions with the rectangle. Perhaps I should proceed by focusing on the angles and the given equalities, trying to find relationships between them, and see if I can derive the measure of angle 3. 

Given that m∠1 = 30°, and we need to find m∠3. Let's look at the angle equalities involving ∠1 and others. 

From the given constraints:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, X, W)), MeasureOf(angle 1)) → ∠AXW = ∠1 = 30°
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W, A, X)), MeasureOf(angle 11)) → ∠WAX = ∠11
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, W, Y)), MeasureOf(angle 7)) → ∠AWY = ∠7
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W, Y, A)), MeasureOf(angle 6)) → ∠WYA = ∠6
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Z)), MeasureOf(angle 8)) → ∠XWZ = ∠8
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X, A, Z)), MeasureOf(angle 10)) → ∠XAZ = ∠10
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y, A, W)), MeasureOf(angle 9)) → ∠YAW = ∠9
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W, Z, X)), MeasureOf(angle 3)) → ∠WZX = ∠3
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, X, W)), MeasureOf(angle 1)) → Already covered
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X, Y, Z)), MeasureOf(angle 5)) → ∠XYZ = ∠5
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y, Z, A)), MeasureOf(angle 4)) → ∠YZA = ∠4
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, A, Y)), MeasureOf(angle 12)) → ∠ZAY = ∠12
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, X, Y)), MeasureOf(angle 2)) → ∠ZXY = ∠2

Also, Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z), Line(Y,W)).

Let me try to draw this mentally. Point A is on both Line(ZW) and Line(YX). Let me assume that A is the intersection of these two lines, even though in a rectangle they should be parallel. Maybe the rectangle is not a standard one, or A is at infinity? Not sure. 

But let's assume that A is a point where Line(ZW) and Line(YX) intersect. Since in a rectangle, these lines are parallel, this would only be possible if they are the same line, which they aren't. Hence, this suggests that the lines are not the sides but something else. 

Wait, perhaps Line(Z, W) is not the side but another line. For example, if WXYZ is a rectangle, then Line(Z, W) could be a diagonal, and Line(Y, X) could be another diagonal or a side. Let me try assuming that Line(Z, W) is diagonal from Z to W, and Line(Y, X) is the side from Y to X. 

If I take the rectangle with points W, X, Y, Z, and assume that Line(Z, W) is the diagonal from Z to W, and Line(Y, X) is the side from Y to X. These two lines might intersect at point A. Let's assign coordinates again. 

Let me place Y at (0, 0), X at (a, 0), Z at (a, b), and W at (0, b). Then, Line(Z, W) is from Z(a, b) to W(0, b), which is a horizontal line y = b. Line(Y, X) is from Y(0, 0) to X(a, 0), which is the horizontal line y = 0. These are parallel, so they don't intersect. Hence, no point A exists. 

Alternatively, if Line(Z, W) is from Z to W, and Line(Y, X) is from Y to X, but in a different configuration. Suppose the rectangle is rotated. Let me try placing Y at (0, 0), W at (0, c), X at (d, 0), and Z at (d, c). Then, Line(Z, W) is from Z(d, c) to W(0, c), which is a horizontal line y = c. Line(Y, X) is from Y(0, 0) to X(d, 0), which is y = 0. Again parallel. 

This seems to suggest that no matter how I arrange the rectangle, these lines are parallel. Hence, there's no intersection. 

Maybe the problem has a mistake, or I'm missing something. Given that the problem provides that Line(YZ) is perpendicular to Line(YW), let me focus on that. Let's assume that in the rectangle, Line(YZ) is perpendicular to Line(YW). 

In this case, if I consider Line(YZ) as one side and Line(YW) as a diagonal, then in the rectangle, this would require that the diagonal YW is perpendicular to side YZ. Let's use coordinates again. Let me set Y at (0, 0), Z at (a, 0), W at (0, b), and X at (-c, 0)? Wait, this might not form a rectangle. Let me think carefully. 

If Y is at (0, 0), and YZ is horizontal to Z(a, 0). To have YW perpendicular to YZ, Line(YW) must be vertical. Hence, W must be at (0, d) for some d. Then, since it's a rectangle, point X would be at (a, d), because from Y(0,0) to X should be the same as from Z(a,0) to W(0,d)? Wait, no. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So if YZ is from Y(0,0) to Z(a, 0), then the opposite side should be from W to X. If W is at (0, d), then X should be at (a, d) to complete the rectangle. 

Thus, the rectangle has vertices Y(0,0), Z(a, 0), X(a, d), W(0, d). Now, Line(YZ) is from Y(0,0) to Z(a, 0), which is horizontal. Line(YW) is from Y(0,0) to W(0, d), which is vertical. Hence, they are perpendicular. This satisfies the condition Perpendicular(Line(YZ), Line(YW)). Great! So this configuration works. 

So in this case, the rectangle has points Y(0,0), Z(a, 0), X(a, d), W(0, d). Now, let's identify other points. Point A lies on Line(Z, W) and Line(Y, X). 

Line(Z, W) is from Z(a, 0) to W(0, d). Let me write its equation. The line passes through (a, 0) and (0, d). The slope is (d - 0)/(0 - a) = -d/a. Equation: y - 0 = (-d/a)(x - a) → y = (-d/a)x + d. 

Line(Y, X) is from Y(0,0) to X(a, d). The slope is (d - 0)/(a - 0) = d/a. Equation: y = (d/a)x. 

To find point A, which is the intersection of these two lines: 

Set y = (-d/a)x + d equal to y = (d/a)x. 

So:

(d/a)x = (-d/a)x + d

Multiply both sides by a:

dx = -dx + ad

Add dx to both sides:

2dx = ad

Divide by d (assuming d ≠ 0):

2x = a → x = a/2

Substitute back into y = (d/a)x: y = (d/a)(a/2) = d/2

So point A is at (a/2, d/2). Which is the center of the rectangle! 

Ah! So point A is the intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection is the midpoint. Hence, A is the center. 

Great, now that we've clarified the position of A, we can proceed to analyze the angles. 

Now, let's note the coordinates of all points:

- Y: (0, 0)
- Z: (a, 0)
- X: (a, d)
- W: (0, d)
- A: (a/2, d/2)

Now, let's analyze the angles mentioned. 

First, let's recall the given angle equalities. We need to find the measure of ∠3, which is Angle(W, Z, X). In terms of the diagram, ∠WZX is the angle at point Z, between points W, Z, X. 

Wait, Angle(W, Z, X) is the angle at point Z, between points W, Z, X. Let me confirm: Angle(W, Z, X) is ∠WZX. 

Looking at the coordinates:

Point Z is at (a, 0). Points W(0, d), Z(a, 0), and X(a, d). So ∠WZX is the angle at Z between lines ZW and ZX. 

Let me compute this angle. First, find vectors ZW and ZX.

Vector ZW is from Z to W: W - Z = (0 - a, d - 0) = (-a, d).

Vector ZX is from Z to X: X - Z = (a - a, d - 0) = (0, d).

The angle between vectors ZW and ZX is ∠WZX. 

Using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (ZW · ZX) / (|ZW| |ZX|)

Compute ZW · ZX = (-a)(0) + (d)(d) = d².

|ZW| = sqrt((-a)^2 + d^2) = sqrt(a² + d²).

|ZX| = sqrt(0² + d²) = d.

Thus,

cosθ = d² / [sqrt(a² + d²) * d] = d / sqrt(a² + d²)

Hence, θ = arccos(d / sqrt(a² + d²)).

Which simplifies to arctan(a/d), because:

If we consider a right triangle with legs a and d, the angle opposite to a is arctan(a/d). Wait, no. Let me think. 

Wait, cosθ = adjacent/hypotenuse = d / hypotenuse. Here, hypotenuse is sqrt(a² + d²), so adjacent is d, opposite is a. Hence, tanθ = opposite/adjacent = a/d. So θ = arctan(a/d). 

But we need to find the measure of ∠3, which is this angle. However, we don't know the values of a and d. However, we are given that m∠1 = 30°, and need to find ∠3. Let's see if we can relate these. 

Now, let's look at ∠1, which is Angle(A, X, W). According to the given equality, this is equal to ∠1. Let's find what this angle is. 

Angle(A, X, W) is the angle at point X between points A, X, W. 

Point X is at (a, d). Points A(a/2, d/2), X(a, d), W(0, d). 

So, vectors XA and XW. 

Vector XA is from X to A: A - X = (a/2 - a, d/2 - d) = (-a/2, -d/2).

Vector XW is from X to W: W - X = (0 - a, d - d) = (-a, 0).

The angle at X between XA and XW is ∠AXW, which is given as ∠1 = 30°. 

Let me compute this angle using the dot product. 

First, compute the vectors:

XA = (-a/2, -d/2)

XW = (-a, 0)

Dot product: (-a/2)(-a) + (-d/2)(0) = a²/2 + 0 = a²/2.

Magnitude of XA: sqrt[(-a/2)^2 + (-d/2)^2] = sqrt(a²/4 + d²/4) = (1/2)sqrt(a² + d²).

Magnitude of XW: sqrt[(-a)^2 + 0^2] = a.

Thus, cosθ = (a²/2) / [(1/2)sqrt(a² + d²) * a] = (a²/2) / [ (a/2) sqrt(a² + d²) ) ] = [a²/2] * [2/(a sqrt(a² + d²))] = a / sqrt(a² + d²).

So, cosθ = a / sqrt(a² + d²), which implies θ = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + d²)) = arctan(d/a). 

Wait, because if we imagine a right triangle with adjacent side a and hypotenuse sqrt(a² + d²), then the opposite side is d, so tan(theta) = d/a. Hence, theta = arctan(d/a). 

But we're told that this angle (∠1) is 30°, so:

arctan(d/a) = 30° → d/a = tan(30°) = 1/√3 → d = a / √3.

Now, we can express d in terms of a. 

Earlier, we had that ∠3 is arctan(a/d). Substituting d = a / √3, we get:

a/d = a / (a/√3) = √3. Hence, ∠3 = arctan(√3) = 60°. 

Therefore, the measure of ∠3 is 60 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 60. 

Let me verify this conclusion. 

Given that ∠1 = 30°, which corresponds to arctan(d/a) = 30°, leading to d/a = 1/√3. Then ∠3 is arctan(a/d) = arctan(√3) = 60°, which matches. 

Thus, the answer should be C.
