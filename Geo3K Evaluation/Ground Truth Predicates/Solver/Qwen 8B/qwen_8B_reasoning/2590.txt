====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some points and lines with certain constraints. Let me start by writing down what's given.

First, the problem says:

- Point H lies on line IG. Wait, no, it says PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(I, G)). So that means point H is on the line connecting points I and G. Similarly, Point K lies on line GJ. So point K is on the line connecting G and J. Also, the lines HK and IJ are parallel. 

We need to find GI, given that GH = 9, GK = 6, and KJ = 4. The answer choices are A. 6, B. 9, C. 12, D. 15.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let me note down the key elements:

Points involved: I, G, J, H, K.

Constraints:

1. H is on line IG. So, points I, G, H are colinear, with H somewhere along that line. But wait, GH is given as 9. Since H is on line IG, then GH is part of that line. So maybe I-G-H? Or H could be between I and G, or beyond G?

Wait, but GH is given as 9. If H is on line IG, then depending on where H is, GH could be a segment from G to H. Let me think. Suppose line IG has points I, G, and H. Then GH would be the distance from G to H. Similarly, K is on line GJ, so line GJ has points G, J, and K? Or K could be between G and J, or extended.

Also, lines HK and IJ are parallel. So, the line connecting H and K is parallel to the line connecting I and J.

Given that, perhaps there's a way to use similar triangles here because of the parallel lines. Let me recall that when two lines are parallel, corresponding angles are equal, which can lead to similar triangles.

Let me try to set up coordinates to model this. Coordinates might make it easier to calculate distances and slopes.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me place point G at the origin (0, 0). Let me suppose that line IG is horizontal for simplicity. Wait, but since HK is parallel to IJ, their slopes should be equal. Alternatively, maybe assigning coordinates based on vectors.

Alternatively, since there are multiple points and lines, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry.

But first, let me consider the relationships. Since H is on line IG, and K is on line GJ, and HK || IJ. So maybe triangle or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the segments given. GH = 9, GK = 6, KJ = 4. So, starting from G, moving to K, then to J. So GK is 6, KJ is 4. Therefore, the entire length from G to J via K would be GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10. So GJ = 10? Wait, but K is on line GJ. So G to K to J. So yes, GJ is split into GK and KJ, meaning that GJ = GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, GJ = 10. Hmm, but how does that relate to GI?

We need to find GI. Let me see. Let me think about the positions again.

Since H is on line IG. Let me denote the positions:

For line IG: Points I, G, H are colinear. Let me assume that G is between I and H, or H is between I and G, or H is beyond G. But since GH is given as 9, that suggests that H is located such that the distance from G to H is 9. So regardless of direction, GH = 9.

Similarly, K is on line GJ. So G is connected to J through K, with GK = 6 and KJ = 4.

Now, lines HK and IJ are parallel. So the line connecting H and K is parallel to the line connecting I and J.

So, perhaps we can use the concept of similar triangles here. Because if two lines are parallel, then maybe the triangles formed are similar.

Let me try to think of triangles involving these lines. For example, if IJ is parallel to HK, then maybe triangle IGH is similar to triangle K... something? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since IJ is parallel to HK, then the ratio of lengths might be consistent.

Wait, maybe using vectors. Let me assign coordinates.

Let me set coordinate system with G at (0, 0). Let me define coordinates for other points.

Let me suppose that line IG is along the x-axis. So point G is at (0, 0). Let me assume that point I is somewhere on the x-axis. Let me say I is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0. Then, since H is on line IG, which is the x-axis. So H is also on the x-axis. The distance from G to H is 9, so H could be at (9, 0) or (-9, 0). Wait, but depending on the position of H relative to G and I.

Wait, but without knowing whether H is between I and G or beyond, it's ambiguous. However, since GH = 9, and IJ is parallel to HK, maybe we can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize the points.

Let me attempt coordinates again. Let me take G at (0, 0).

Let me define line GJ. Since K is on line GJ, and GK = 6, KJ = 4, then the coordinates of K can be determined once we know the direction of GJ. Let me assume that line GJ is along some direction. Let me parameterize line GJ. Let me suppose that line GJ is arbitrary; however, since we need to relate it with line HK being parallel to IJ, perhaps we can find relations between the coordinates.

Alternatively, since IJ is parallel to HK, their slopes are equal.

Let me think about vector approach. Let me denote vectors for the points.

Let me suppose that vector IG is from I to G, but maybe better to think in terms of coordinates.

Let me fix coordinate system:

Set G at (0, 0). Let me assume that line GJ is along the x-axis. Wait, but then line IG is another line. Wait, but if IJ is parallel to HK, which connects H and K. Let me try.

Suppose line GJ is along the x-axis. So point G is at (0, 0), and line GJ goes towards J. Since K is on line GJ, and GK = 6, KJ = 4. So total length GJ is 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, coordinates of J would be at (10, 0), assuming G is at (0, 0) and K is at (6, 0). Wait, but if G is at (0, 0), and K is 6 units away from G along GJ, then K is at (6, 0). Then J is 4 units away from K in the same direction, so J would be at (6 + 4, 0) = (10, 0). So coordinates: G(0, 0), K(6, 0), J(10, 0).

Now, point H is on line IG. But what is line IG? We don't know its direction yet. Let me assume that line IG is not along the x-axis, since otherwise, if both IG and GJ were on x-axis, then IJ would be along x-axis, and HK would be parallel to that. But let me check.

Wait, but we need to determine the position of H on line IG. Let me denote line IG. Let me assume that line IG is some line passing through G(0, 0) and point I. Let me denote coordinates of I as (p, q), so that line IG passes through G(0, 0) and I(p, q). Then, point H is on line IG, so it can be represented as H = t*(p, q) for some scalar t. The distance GH is 9, so |H - G| = sqrt[(tp)^2 + (tq)^2] = |t| * sqrt(p² + q²) = 9. But without knowing p and q, this seems too vague. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since we have the condition that line HK is parallel to line IJ. Let me find expressions for those lines.

Coordinates:

- G is at (0, 0)
- K is at (6, 0)
- J is at (10, 0)

Now, point H is on line IG. Let me denote I as (x, y), so line IG goes from I(x, y) through G(0, 0). Then, point H lies on this line. Let me parametrize H. Let me write parametric equations for line IG. Any point on line IG can be expressed as G + s(I - G) = sI, where s is a real number. Wait, since G is at (0, 0), then line IG can be parametrized as t*I, where t is a scalar. So point H is somewhere along that line. Let me say H corresponds to parameter t. So H = t*I. Then, the distance GH is the distance from G(0,0) to H(t*x, t*y) which is sqrt[(tx)^2 + (ty)^2] = |t| * sqrt(x² + y²) = 9. So that gives us |t| * |I| = 9, where |I| is the magnitude of vector I.

But I don't know the coordinates of I yet. However, we also have that line HK is parallel to line IJ. Let me find the coordinates of line IJ and line HK.

First, line IJ connects points I(x, y) and J(10, 0). Its slope is (0 - y)/(10 - x) = -y/(10 - x).

Line HK connects points H(t*x, t*y) and K(6, 0). Its slope is [0 - t*y]/[6 - t*x] = (-t y)/(6 - t x).

Since these lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal:

(-t y)/(6 - t x) = -y/(10 - x)

Assuming y ≠ 0 (otherwise, if y=0, then I would be on the x-axis, making line IG along x-axis, leading to possible issues with parallelism). Let me cancel out -y from both sides:

(t y)/(6 - t x) = y/(10 - x)

Cancel y (assuming y ≠ 0):

t / (6 - t x) = 1 / (10 - x)

Cross-multiplying:

t (10 - x) = 6 - t x

Expanding left side: 10t - t x = 6 - t x

Subtracting -t x from both sides cancels out:

10t = 6 → t = 6/10 = 3/5.

So t = 3/5. Therefore, the coordinates of H are t*I = ( (3/5)x, (3/5)y )

Now, the distance GH is given as 9. Earlier, we had |t| * |I| = 9. Here, t = 3/5, so:

(3/5)|I| = 9 → |I| = 9 * (5/3) = 15. Therefore, the length of vector I (distance from G to I) is 15. Hence, GI = |I| = 15. Wait, but that would mean GI is 15, which is option D. Is that correct?

Wait, but let me confirm. Because GI is the distance from G to I, which is |I|. And according to our calculation, |I| = 15. Therefore, GI = 15, so answer D.

But let me verify this conclusion again. Let me recap:

We set up coordinates with G at (0, 0), J at (10, 0), K at (6, 0). Then, line IG has point I(x, y), and H is along that line. By setting up the slope equality due to parallel lines, we derived that t = 3/5, and then using GH = 9 led us to |I| = 15, hence GI = 15. That seems straightforward.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. For instance, could there be another scenario where H is on the extension of IG beyond G? For example, if t is negative. Let me check.

Earlier, we assumed that t was positive, but actually, t could be negative. However, in our equation when we canceled y, we divided both sides by y, assuming y ≠ 0. Also, when solving for t, we arrived at t = 3/5 regardless of signs. However, if t were negative, would that affect anything?

Wait, suppose t is negative. Let's re-examine the slope calculation. If t is negative, then the coordinates of H would be (t x, t y). Let me recheck the slope calculation.

Original equation after cancelling y:

t / (6 - t x) = 1 / (10 - x)

If t is negative, then 6 - t x becomes 6 - (negative)*x = 6 + |t|x. But regardless, solving the equation gives t = 3/5. So even if t is negative, the algebra still leads to t = 3/5. But that would imply that t is positive. Therefore, our assumption that t is positive holds, and thus H is in the direction from G to I.

Therefore, the value of t is positive, so H is between G and I, or beyond I. Wait, but t is 3/5, which is less than 1. So if t = 3/5, then H is between G and I. Because if I is at (x, y), then H is at 3/5 of the way from G to I. So GI is the full length, and GH is 3/5 of GI. Which would mean that GH = (3/5)GI. Given that GH = 9, so 3/5 GI = 9 ⇒ GI = 15. Yes! Exactly. Therefore, GI = 15. So answer D.

Wait, that makes sense. So the answer is D. 15. Let me check if there's any mistake in my reasoning.

Another way to think: since lines HK and IJ are parallel, then the ratio of GH/GI equals the ratio of KJ/GJ? Wait, not sure. Wait, in similar triangles, maybe.

Wait, if we consider the transversal lines. Since HK || IJ, then maybe triangles HIG and ... something?

Alternatively, think of vectors. The vector from H to K is proportional to the vector from I to J.

Vector HK = K - H = (6, 0) - H. Vector IJ = J - I = (10, 0) - I.

Since they're parallel, there exists scalar k such that:

K - H = k*(J - I)

Let me express H as t*I, as before. Since H lies on line IG, which passes through G and I, so H = t*I. Wait, but earlier we considered H = t*I, with t being a scalar. However, in that case, if G is at (0,0), then vector IH = H - I = t*I - I = (t - 1)I. Not sure.

But using the previous approach, we found that t = 3/5, leading to GI = 15. Another way to look at it: since H divides IG in the ratio t:(1-t)? Wait, no. If H is on line IG, then depending on t, it's a scalar multiple. If t = 3/5, then H is closer to G than to I. So GI is the whole length, and GH = 3/5 GI. Thus, GH = 9 implies GI = 15. So that seems solid.

Alternatively, using mass point or section formula. But since the lines are parallel, maybe similar triangles apply.

Imagine that because HK || IJ, the triangles formed are similar. For example, triangle HGI similar to triangle JKI? Not sure. Wait, but maybe considering the ratios.

Alternatively, since HK || IJ, the ratio of GH to GI equals the ratio of KJ to something. Wait, let's think.

In the setup, with HK || IJ, the triangles may be similar. Let me think of the transversals cutting the lines.

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry, we already found that GI = 15, which matches with answer D. So unless there's a miscalculation in my steps, that should be correct.

Let me check once more:

From the slope equality, we had t = 3/5. Then GH = 9 = t*GI. Therefore, GI = 9 / t = 9 / (3/5) = 15. Yes. Perfect. So that confirms it. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 15.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration and applying coordinate geometry principles alongside vector analysis to derive the unknown length $ GI $. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Coordinates**

We are told:
- Point $ G $ lies at the origin: $ G = (0, 0) $
- $ K $ lies on line $ GJ $, with $ GK = 6 $ and $ KJ = 4 $
- This implies $ GJ = GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10 $

Let’s place:
- $ G = (0, 0) $
- $ K = (6, 0) $ (since $ GK = 6 $, and placing $ GJ $ along the x-axis simplifies calculations)
- $ J = (10, 0) $ (as $ KJ = 4 $)

Thus, line $ GJ $ lies along the x-axis.

---

### **Step 2: Define Point $ H $**

Point $ H $ lies on line $ IG $, so it lies along the line joining $ I $ and $ G $. Assume point $ I = (x, y) $, so the line $ IG $ is parametrizable as:
$$
\text{Any point } P \text{ on line } IG = t \cdot I = (tx, ty), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}
$$

So, $ H = (tx, ty) $ for some scalar $ t $, and the distance $ GH = 9 $:
$$
GH = \sqrt{(tx)^2 + (ty)^2} = |t|\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 9
$$

This tells us:
$$
|t| \cdot |I| = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |I| = \frac{9}{|t|}
$$

Where $ |I| $ represents the length of vector $ \vec{GI} $, i.e., the length $ GI $.

---

### **Step 3: Use Parallel Lines Condition**

It is given that $ \overline{HK} \parallel \overline{IJ} $, implying the slopes of these lines are equal.

Compute the slope of $ \overline{HK} $:
- $ H = (tx, ty) $
- $ K = (6, 0) $
- Slope of $ \overline{HK} = \frac{0 - ty}{6 - tx} = \frac{-ty}{6 - tx} $

Compute the slope of $ \overline{IJ} $:
- $ I = (x, y) $
- $ J = (10, 0) $
- Slope of $ \overline{IJ} = \frac{0 - y}{10 - x} = \frac{-y}{10 - x} $

Setting the slopes equal:
$$
\frac{-ty}{6 - tx} = \frac{-y}{10 - x}
$$

Cancel out $ -y $ (assuming $ y \ne 0 $):
$$
\frac{t}{6 - tx} = \frac{1}{10 - x}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
t(10 - x) = 6 - tx
$$

Expand:
$$
10t - tx = 6 - tx
$$

Add $ tx $ to both sides:
$$
10t = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{3}{5}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ GI $ Using $ t $**

Recall:
$$
GH = |t| \cdot |I| = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \cdot |I| = 9
$$

Solving for $ |I| $ (which is $ GI $):
$$
|I| = \frac{9}{3/5} = 15
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length $ GI $ is therefore:
$$
\boxed{15}
$$
