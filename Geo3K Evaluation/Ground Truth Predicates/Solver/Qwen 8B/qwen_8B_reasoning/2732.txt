A. \frac { 3 } { \sqrt 2 }
B. 3 \sqrt 2
C. 6 \sqrt 2
D. 12 \sqrt 2

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that there's a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches, and we need to find the length of the side of the square. Hmm, right. Let me recall some geometry here.

First, when a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Because all four corners of the square touch the circumference of the circle, so the diagonal stretches from one corner of the square through the center of the circle to the opposite corner. That makes sense.

So, the radius of the circle is given as 6 inches. Therefore, the diameter would be twice that, which is 12 inches. So the diagonal of the square is 12 inches. Now, I need to relate the diagonal of the square to its side length.

Let me remember the formula for the diagonal of a square. If the side length is 's', then the diagonal 'd' can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the diagonal divides the square into two right-angled triangles, each with legs of length 's' and hypotenuse 'd'. So:

d = s√2

Therefore, solving for 's', we get:

s = d / √2

Substituting the value of the diagonal (which is 12 inches):

s = 12 / √2

But usually, rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

s = (12 * √2) / (√2 * √2) = (12√2)/2 = 6√2

Wait, but let me check again. Wait, the radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Then the diagonal of the square equals the diameter. So yes, diagonal is 12. Then s = 12 / √2 = 6√2. Which simplifies to 6 times square root of 2. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 6√2. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me go through once more.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Suppose the square is inscribed in the circle, so the center of the circle is also the center of the square. The radius is 6, so the distance from the center to any vertex of the square is 6. That distance is half the diagonal of the square. Wait, no. Wait, the entire diagonal is the diameter, which is 12. So half-diagonal is 6, which is the radius. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, hold on.

If the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, then the diagonal is 12. Therefore, half of the diagonal (from center to vertex) is 6, which matches the radius. So that checks out. So then the diagonal is 12, so s = 12 / √2 = 6√2. So that seems correct.

Looking at the answer choices: option C is 6√2. So that should be the answer. Wait, but let me check again if I made a mistake here. For example, sometimes people confuse between radius and diameter. Let me confirm once more.

The square is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Given radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Hence, diagonal = 12. Then, since diagonal of square is s√2, then s = 12 / √2. Rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by √2: (12√2)/2 = 6√2. Yep, same result. So answer is C.

But let me check the answer choices again. The options are:

A. 3 / sqrt(2)

B. 3 sqrt(2)

C. 6 sqrt(2)

D. 12 sqrt(2)

Yes, so 6√2 is option C. So the correct answer is C. Therefore, Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches, we begin by recognizing a key geometric relationship:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

When a square is **inscribed** in a circle, its **diagonal** becomes the **diameter** of the circle. This means that the diagonal of the square passes through the center of the circle and connects two opposite vertices of the square.

Given:
- Radius of the circle = $ r = 6 $ inches  
→ Diameter of the circle = $ 2r = 12 $ inches  

Thus, the **length of the diagonal of the square is 12 inches**.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Relationship Between Side Length and Diagonal of a Square**

For a square with side length $ s $, the **diagonal** $ d $ satisfies the equation derived from the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
d = s\sqrt{2}
$$

We can rearrange this to solve for $ s $:

$$
s = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Now substitute $ d = 12 $:

$$
s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Given Answer Choices**

From the provided choices:

- A. $ \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} $
- B. $ 3\sqrt{2} $
- C. $ 6\sqrt{2} $
- D. $ 12\sqrt{2} $

Our computed value is $ 6\sqrt{2} $, which corresponds directly to **Choice C**.
