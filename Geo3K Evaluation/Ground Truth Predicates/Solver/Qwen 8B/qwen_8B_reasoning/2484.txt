MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The lengths of line segments AB is 42 units, BC is 38 units, and AC is x units. Also, it's given that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Hmm, so triangle ABC has a right angle at point C? Wait, because the lines CA and CB are perpendicular. That means angle at C is 90 degrees. Oh, right! So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I got the sides right. If the right angle is at C, then the two legs would be AC and BC, and the hypotenuse would be AB. But wait, AB is given as 42, which would be the hypotenuse. Then AC and BC are the legs. Wait, but BC is given as 38. So AC is x, BC is 38, and AB is 42. So according to Pythagoras:

AB² = AC² + BC²

So plugging in the numbers:

42² = x² + 38²

Let me compute that. First, calculate 42 squared. 42*42... Well, 40² is 1600, plus 2*40*2 + 2² = 1600 + 160 + 4 = 1764. So 42² is 1764.

Then 38 squared is... 38*38. Let me do (40 - 2)² = 40² - 2*40*2 + 2² = 1600 - 160 + 4 = 1444. So 38² is 1444.

Therefore, substituting into the equation:

1764 = x² + 1444

Subtracting 1444 from both sides gives x² = 1764 - 1444. Let me compute that difference. 1764 minus 1444. Let's see, 1764 - 1400 is 364, then subtract another 44: 364 - 44 = 320. So x² = 320.

Then x is the square root of 320. Simplify sqrt(320). Let's factor 320. 320 divided by 16 is 20, so sqrt(16 * 20) = 4*sqrt(20). Then sqrt(20) can be simplified further as sqrt(4*5) = 2*sqrt(5). So altogether, 4*2*sqrt(5) = 8*sqrt(5). Therefore, x equals 8√5. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 8√5. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just check my steps again. 

First, confirming the triangle is right-angled at C. Since lines CA and CB are perpendicular, yes, that makes sense. Then applying Pythagoras correctly. Calculated AB² as 42²=1764, BC²=38²=1444. Subtracting gives x²=320. Then simplifying sqrt(320) as 8√5. Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length $ x $ of segment $ AC $, we start by analyzing the given geometric configuration:

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
We are told:
- $ AB = 42 $
- $ BC = 38 $
- $ \angle C = 90^\circ $ (since lines $ CA $ and $ CB $ are perpendicular)

This means triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ C $. Thus, the Pythagorean Theorem applies directly.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
42^2 = x^2 + 38^2
$$

Calculate each term:

- $ 42^2 = 1764 $
- $ 38^2 = 1444 $

Now substitute these into the equation:

$$
1764 = x^2 + 1444
$$

Solving for $ x^2 $:

$$
x^2 = 1764 - 1444 = 320
$$

Take the square root of both sides:

$$
x = \sqrt{320}
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Square Root
Factor $ 320 $:

$$
\sqrt{320} = \sqrt{16 \times 20} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{20} = 4 \cdot \sqrt{4 \cdot 5} = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{5}
$$

Thus,

$$
x = 8\sqrt{5}
$$

---

### Final Answer:
The value of $ x $ matches **option C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
