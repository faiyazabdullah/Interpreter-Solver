MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the setup based on the given constraints. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

So, we have points T, R, S, L, and W. The problem states that:

1. Point L lies on line TR. Wait, no—actually, the first constraint says "PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(T, R))". So point L is on the line segment connecting T and R? Or maybe just the line? Hmm, but since it's called Line(T, R), that would be the infinite line passing through T and R. But then again, depending on the exact configuration, maybe L is somewhere along that line.

Then, Point W lies on Line(R, S). Similarly, so W is on the line RS.

Also, there's a Parallel condition: Line(T, S) is parallel to Line(L, W).

We're given some lengths: RL = 5, RT = 9, WS = 6. Need to find RW.

Wait, let me clarify the notation. In geometry problems, sometimes uppercase letters denote points, and segments between them. So, for example, RL would be the length between points R and L. Similarly, RT is the distance between R and T, which is given as 9. Then WS is the length between W and S, which is 6.

The goal is to find RW, the distance between R and W.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points T, R, S, L, W. Let me think about their positions.

First, since L lies on line TR. So line TR connects T and R. Therefore, point L is somewhere on that line. Given that RL = 5. Since RT is 9, which is the total length from R to T. If RL is part of that line, then perhaps L is between R and T? Because if RL is 5, and RT is 9, then LT would be RT - RL = 9 - 5 = 4. So that would mean L divides RT into segments RL=5 and LT=4. Alternatively, maybe L is extended beyond R, making RL longer than RT? But since RT is given as 9, and RL is 5, which is less than 9, so likely L is between R and T.

Similarly, W lies on line RS. So line RS goes from R to S, and W is somewhere on that line. We know WS = 6. So if we can determine the position of W relative to R and S, that might help.

Additionally, lines TS and LW are parallel. So Line(T, S) is parallel to Line(L, W). That suggests that these two lines never meet, and thus their slopes (if considering coordinate geometry) are equal.

Since we have parallel lines and points lying on certain lines, maybe similar triangles could come into play here? Or perhaps using coordinates?

Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would make this easier. Let me try that approach.

Let me place point R at the origin (0, 0) to simplify calculations. Then, since RT = 9, and assuming that line TR is horizontal for simplicity (since direction isn't specified), I can set coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume that line TR is along the x-axis. So point R is at (0, 0), and point T is at (9, 0), because RT = 9 units. Now, point L lies on line TR. Since RL = 5, and if L is between R and T, then its coordinate would be (5, 0). Wait, because from R(0,0) moving towards T(9,0), 5 units away would be at x=5. So L is at (5, 0). That makes sense.

Now, we need to consider line RS. Wait, but where is point S? The problem mentions line RS, and point W lies on it. However, we don't know the coordinates of S yet. Also, we know that line TS is parallel to line LW.

Hmm. Let me think. Let me assign coordinates to S. Let me assume that line RS is another line; perhaps vertical or something else. Wait, but without knowing angles, maybe I need to define variables for coordinates.

Alternatively, since lines TS and LW are parallel, maybe we can use vectors or slopes.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, coordinates:

- R = (0, 0)
- T = (9, 0)
- L = (5, 0) since RL = 5 along TR.

Now, need to find coordinates of S and W such that W lies on RS, and line TS is parallel to line LW.

But we also know that WS = 6. Let me denote S as some point, say (a, b). Then line RS connects R(0,0) to S(a,b). Point W lies on RS. Let me parametrize point W.

Parametric equations for line RS: starting at R(0,0) going towards S(a,b). Any point on RS can be written as (ta, tb) where t is a parameter between 0 and 1 if W is between R and S, but it could be extended beyond.

Given that WS = 6. Let me compute the distance between W and S. Suppose W is at (ta, tb). Then vector from W to S is (a - ta, b - tb) = ((1 - t)a, (1 - t)b). The length of WS is sqrt[ ((1 - t)a)^2 + ((1 - t)b)^2 ] = |1 - t| * sqrt(a² + b²). This equals 6.

But we don't know S's coordinates. Maybe I need more constraints.

Also, line TS is parallel to line LW.

First, let me find coordinates for line TS. T is (9, 0), S is (a, b). So vector TS is (a - 9, b - 0) = (a - 9, b).

Line LW connects L(5, 0) to W(ta, tb). Vector LW is (ta - 5, tb - 0) = (ta - 5, tb).

For these lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. So (a - 9, b) = k*(ta - 5, tb) for some scalar k.

Therefore,

a - 9 = k(ta - 5)

and 

b = k(tb)

From the second equation: b = kt*b. Assuming b ≠ 0 (otherwise, if b = 0, then line RS would be horizontal, same as TR, but then TS would be horizontal too, leading to LW also horizontal... but let's see.)

Assuming b ≠ 0, then dividing both sides by b gives 1 = k*t => k = 1/t.

Substituting back into the first equation:

a - 9 = (1/t)(ta - 5) => a - 9 = a - 5/t => Subtract a from both sides:

-9 = -5/t => Multiply both sides by t:

-9t = -5 => t = 5/9.

So t = 5/9. That means point W divides RS in the ratio t : (1 - t) = 5/9 : 4/9, i.e., 5:4 from R to S.

So coordinates of W are (ta, tb) = ( (5/9)a, (5/9)b ).

Now, let's go back to the WS length. Earlier, we had that |1 - t| * sqrt(a² + b²) = 6. Since t = 5/9, then 1 - t = 4/9. Thus:

(4/9)*sqrt(a² + b²) = 6 => sqrt(a² + b²) = 6 * (9/4) = 54/4 = 13.5.

Therefore, sqrt(a² + b²) = 13.5. Which implies that the length of RS is 13.5, since RS is from R(0,0) to S(a,b), so RS has length sqrt(a² + b²) = 13.5.

But do we need this? Not sure yet.

But we need to find RW. Since W is on RS, and t = 5/9, then the distance from R to W is t times RS. Because when you move along RS from R to S, the distance from R to W is t multiplied by the total length of RS. Hence:

RW = t * RS = (5/9) * 13.5.

Calculate that: 13.5 divided by 9 is 1.5, then multiplied by 5 gives 7.5. Wait, but 13.5 is equal to 27/2. So 27/2 * 5 / 9 = (27*5)/(2*9) = (3*5)/2 = 15/2 = 7.5. So RW = 7.5.

But wait, looking at the answer choices, D is 7.5. But let me check again.

Wait, but hold on—is this correct? Because the calculation assumes that RS has length 13.5, which comes from the WS being 6. But is there another way to confirm this?

Alternatively, maybe we can express RS in terms of coordinates.

But let me think again. Since we derived that t = 5/9, and RW is t * RS. But RS length is sqrt(a² + b²) = 13.5, so RW = 5/9 * 13.5 = 7.5. So that would be option D. But let me check if there's any mistake here.

Wait, but why did we assume that RS is length 13.5? Because we used the formula for the length of WS. Let me recheck that step.

Earlier, we said that WS = |1 - t| * sqrt(a² + b²) = 6. With t = 5/9, so |1 - t| = 4/9. Therefore, sqrt(a² + b²) = 6/(4/9) ) = 6 * 9/4 = 54/4 = 13.5. Correct.

Thus RS = 13.5, and RW = t * RS = 5/9 * 13.5. Let me calculate that again:

13.5 divided by 9 is 1.5, then multiplied by 5 is 7.5. Yes. So RW = 7.5, which corresponds to option D.

But wait, the answer choices include D as 7.5. So according to this, the answer should be D.

However, let me verify once again. Is there a possibility that my assumption about the direction of the points is incorrect? For example, maybe point W is not between R and S, but beyond S?

Because in our calculation, we assumed that t is between 0 and 1, meaning W is between R and S. But what if t > 1, meaning W is beyond S?

In that case, |1 - t| would still be t - 1, and the same formula applies. However, in that case, the value of t would be different. Let me check.

Wait, earlier, we derived t = 5/9 regardless of whether W is between R and S or not. How?

Wait, let me revisit the equations. When we considered the direction vectors for TS and LW being parallel. The key was solving for t, which came out as 5/9. But does that hold even if W is beyond S?

Wait, let me think again. The parametrization of W as (ta, tb) assumes that t is a scalar multiple along the line RS. If W is beyond S, then t would be greater than 1. However, in our previous steps, we arrived at t = 5/9, which is less than 1, implying W is between R and S. But is that necessarily true?

Alternatively, maybe there's another scenario where t is negative, placing W on the opposite side of R from S.

But let's think about the parallelism condition. Let me consider the direction vectors again.

Vector TS is (a - 9, b). Vector LW is (ta - 5, tb). These vectors must be scalar multiples.

So, (a - 9, b) = k*(ta - 5, tb). From the y-component: b = k*tb. If b ≠ 0, then k = 1/t. Then substituting into x-component:

a - 9 = (1/t)*(ta - 5) → a - 9 = a - 5/t → -9 = -5/t → t = 5/9. So regardless of the position of W (whether between R and S or not), t is 5/9. Therefore, even if W were beyond S, the value of t would still be 5/9. Wait, but if t = 5/9 < 1, then W is between R and S. If t > 1, then W is beyond S. But according to this algebra, t is fixed as 5/9. So that suggests that W is between R and S. Therefore, our initial assumption holds.

Hence, RW = t * RS = (5/9) * 13.5 = 7.5. Therefore, the answer is D.

But let me cross-validate with another approach. Maybe using similar triangles?

Since lines TS || LW, then triangle TLS might be similar to some other triangle? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, since TS || LW, then the slope of TS equals slope of LW.

Coordinates:

T is (9,0), S is (a,b). Slope of TS is (b - 0)/(a - 9) = b/(a - 9).

L is (5,0), W is (ta, tb). Slope of LW is (tb - 0)/(ta - 5) = tb/(ta - 5).

Setting them equal: b/(a - 9) = tb/(ta - 5). Assuming b ≠ 0, cancel b:

1/(a - 9) = t/(ta - 5)

Cross-multiplying: ta - 5 = t(a - 9)

Expand RHS: ta - 9t

So ta - 5 = ta - 9t → subtract ta from both sides:

-5 = -9t → t = 5/9. Same result as before. So this confirms t = 5/9.

Therefore, RW = 5/9 * RS. And RS = 13.5, so RW = 7.5. So answer D.

But let me check if there's another way to get RS. Wait, do we have any other info?

We know that WS = 6. Since W is located at t = 5/9 along RS, then the distance from W to S is (1 - t) * RS = 4/9 * RS = 6. Therefore, RS = 6 * 9/4 = 54/4 = 13.5. Exactly as before.

Therefore, RW = 5/9 * RS = 5/9 * 54/4 = (5 * 54)/(9 * 4) = (5 * 6)/4 = 30/4 = 7.5. Yep.

So RW is 7.5, which is option D.

Looking back at the answer choices: D is 7.5. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check if I made any wrong assumptions. For instance, did I correctly model the coordinates?

I placed R at (0,0), T at (9,0), L at (5,0). Then, S is some arbitrary point (a,b). The rest follows. The key was that the parallel condition forced t = 5/9, leading to RW = 5/9 * RS, and then using WS = 6 to find RS. All seems consistent.

Another sanity check: suppose RS is 13.5, then RW is 5/9 of that, so 7.5. And WS is 4/9 of RS, which is 6. 4/9 * 13.5 = 6. Correct. So all numbers add up.

Therefore, the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length $ RW $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and applying coordinate geometry principles.

---

### **Step 1: Coordinate Assignment**

Assign coordinates to simplify the problem:

- Place point $ R $ at the origin: $ R = (0, 0) $
- Since $ RT = 9 $, place $ T $ at $ (9, 0) $
- Since $ RL = 5 $, and $ L $ lies on line $ TR $, place $ L $ at $ (5, 0) $

This places all three points $ R, T, L $ on the x-axis, with known distances between them.

---

### **Step 2: Parametrize Point $ W $ on Line $ RS $**

Let the coordinates of point $ S $ be $ (a, b) $. Then, the line $ RS $ extends from $ R = (0, 0) $ to $ S = (a, b) $.

Any point $ W $ on line $ RS $ can be expressed parametrically as:
$$
W = (ta, tb), \quad \text{where } t \in \mathbb{R}
$$

We are told that $ WS = 6 $. Using the distance formula:
$$
WS = |1 - t| \cdot \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6
\Rightarrow \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \frac{6}{|1 - t|}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Use the Parallel Condition**

We’re told that $ \overline{TS} \parallel \overline{LW} $. This means the direction vectors of these lines are scalar multiples.

- Direction vector of $ \overline{TS} $: 
  $$
  \vec{TS} = (a - 9, b)
  $$

- Direction vector of $ \overline{LW} $: 
  $$
  \vec{LW} = (ta - 5, tb)
  $$

Equating direction vectors:
$$
(a - 9, b) = k(ta - 5, tb)
\Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
a - 9 = k(ta - 5) \\
b = k(tb)
\end{cases}
$$

From the second equation:  
$$
b = k(tb) \Rightarrow k = \frac{1}{t}, \text{assuming } b \neq 0
$$

Plug into the first equation:
$$
a - 9 = \frac{1}{t}(ta - 5) \Rightarrow a - 9 = a - \frac{5}{t}
\Rightarrow -9 = -\frac{5}{t} \Rightarrow t = \frac{5}{9}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute Length $ RW $**

Using the parameter $ t = \frac{5}{9} $, and knowing that:
$$
RS = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

From the earlier relation:
$$
|1 - t|\cdot RS = 6 \Rightarrow \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)\cdot RS = 6 \Rightarrow RS = \frac{54}{4} = 13.5
$$

Then,
$$
RW = t \cdot RS = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 13.5 = \frac{5}{9} \cdot \frac{27}{2} = \frac{135}{18} = 7.5
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length $ RW $ is therefore:
$$
\boxed{7.5}
$$

---
