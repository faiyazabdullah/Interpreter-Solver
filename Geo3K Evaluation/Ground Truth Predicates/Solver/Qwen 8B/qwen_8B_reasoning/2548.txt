MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral DEFG which is a rectangle. The question gives us two angles: angle EDF is 5x - 3 degrees, and angle DFG is 3x + 7 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle EDF. The answer choices are A. 22, B. 45, C. 68, D. 90.

First, since it's a rectangle, I remember that all angles in a rectangle are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but the problem gives expressions for two angles. That seems conflicting unless those angles are not the usual ones. Let me think again. Maybe the angles mentioned aren't the internal angles of the rectangle? Or maybe they are?

Wait, the problem says Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. But the angles given here are angle EDF and angle DFG. Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me sketch mentally the rectangle DEFG. Let me label the points properly. Let me assume the order of the quadrilateral is D-E-F-G-D. So, the vertices are D connected to E, E connected to F, F connected to G, and G connected back to D. 

So, angle EDF would be at vertex D, between points E, D, F. Wait, so point D is connected to E and to G (since it's a rectangle). Then angle EDF is formed at D by points E, D, F. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent angles are 90 degrees. Wait, but if DEFG is a rectangle, then angle at D should be 90 degrees. However, angle EDF is part of that angle? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Let me consider the structure. In rectangle DEFG, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So, at vertex D, there are two sides: DE and DG. Therefore, the angle at D is between DE and DG, which should be 90 degrees. But the problem mentions angle EDF. Hmm, so point F is connected to D? Wait, in the rectangle, point F is connected to E and G. So, how does F connect to D? Unless there's a diagonal? Because in the problem statement, there's also some perpendicularity condition: Perpendicular(Line(D, G), Line(G, F)). Wait, line DG is perpendicular to line GF? Let me check.

The problem states that Perpendicular(Line(D, G), Line(G, F)). So, line DG is perpendicular to line GF. Since DG is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal (assuming standard position), and GF is another side? Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. Wait, if DG is one side, then GF should be adjacent to it. But in a rectangle, consecutive sides are perpendicular. So, if DG is one side, then GF should be perpendicular to DG. Which makes sense because GF would be another side of the rectangle. Wait, but in a rectangle, consecutive sides are perpendicular. So, DG and GF are adjacent sides, hence they should be perpendicular. Therefore, that condition is already satisfied in a rectangle. So perhaps that's just reinforcing that it's a rectangle?

But wait, the problem also mentions that Point L lies on lines AG and FE? Wait, no, looking back:

Original problem says:

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(G, E))

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(F, D))

Wait, hold on. There's a point A that lies on both line GE and line FD? Wait, but the main focus is on quadrilateral DEFG. Maybe point A is an intersection point? But maybe that's irrelevant? Wait, the problem didn't mention anything else about point A except these two conditions. But the main question is about quadrilateral DEFG being a rectangle, and angles at EDF and DFG. Maybe point A is extraneous information? Or maybe I misread.

Wait, the original problem might have been translated or formatted differently. Let me recheck:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(G, E))
PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(F, D))
Perpendicular(Line(D, G), Line(G, F))

QUESTION:
Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m ∠EDF = 5x - 3 and m ∠DFG = 3x + 7, find m ∠EDF."

Wait, so the given constraints include that point A lies on both GE and FD. But the question is about quadrilateral DEFG. Maybe point A is the intersection point of GE and FD? But since DEFG is a rectangle, GE and FD... Let me see. Let me think about the rectangle DEFG. Points D, E, F, G. So, GE would be a diagonal? From G to E. And FD would be from F to D. If A is their intersection, then maybe A is the center of the rectangle? But since it's a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other. So, the diagonals EG and DF intersect at point A. So, that's probably why A is defined as lying on both GE and FD. But maybe that's extra info. However, the problem says that the quadrilateral is a rectangle, so perhaps that's already given. So maybe the key is that angle EDF and angle DFG are given, and we need to find their measures based on the rectangle's properties.

But earlier thought was that angle EDF is at vertex D. Let me confirm. Angle EDF is the angle at D, between ED and FD. Wait, but in the rectangle DEFG, point F is connected to E and G. So, FD is connecting F to D. So, FD is a diagonal? Because in rectangle DEFG, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. Diagonals would be DF and EG. So, FD is a diagonal from F to D. Similarly, GE is the diagonal from G to E. So, point A is the intersection of diagonals FD and GE. But since in a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so point A is the midpoint of both diagonals.

However, the problem mentions angles EDF and DFG. Let me focus on those angles.

Angle EDF: At point D, between points E, D, F. So, that's angle between DE and DF. Since DE is a side of the rectangle, and DF is a diagonal. Similarly, angle DFG is at point F, between points D, F, G. So, that's angle between DF and FG. Since FG is a side of the rectangle.

Now, since DEFG is a rectangle, DE is perpendicular to DG, and FG is perpendicular to FG? Wait, no. Wait, FG is a side; in a rectangle, each side is perpendicular to the next. So, FG is adjacent to GF and FG is connected to F and G. So, FG is perpendicular to FG? No, FG is connected to F and G. Wait, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So, at point F, the sides are EF and FG. So, angle at F is between EF and FG, which is 90 degrees. But angle DFG is at point F, between D, F, G. So, that would be the same as angle at F between DF and FG. Wait, DF is a diagonal, and FG is a side. So, angle DFG is between diagonal DF and side FG.

Therefore, angle EDF is between side DE and diagonal DF, and angle DFG is between diagonal DF and side FG. Since DEFG is a rectangle, DE is parallel to FG, and EF is parallel to DG. Also, diagonals in a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.

Now, since angle EDF and angle DFG are related through the diagonal DF. Let me consider triangle DFG. Wait, no. Let me think about triangle DFG? Or maybe triangle DEF?

Alternatively, since DF is a diagonal of the rectangle, splitting it into two triangles. For example, triangle DGF and triangle DFE.

But angle EDF is part of triangle DEF, while angle DFG is part of triangle DFG.

Alternatively, since in a rectangle, the diagonals split the angles into two parts. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and they bisect each other but do they bisect the angles? Only in a square. In general rectangles, the diagonals don't bisect the angles unless it's a square.

So, angle EDF is not necessarily half of the angle at D, which is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle EDF is part of the angle at D. Let me think. At point D, the angle is between DE and DG, which is 90 degrees. However, DF is a diagonal from D to F. So, angle EDF is between DE and DF, and angle FDG is between DF and DG. So, angle EDF + angle FDG = 90 degrees. Similarly, at point F, angle DFG is part of the angle at F, which is 90 degrees. The angle at F is between EF and FG, which is 90 degrees. The diagonal DF splits this angle into angle DFG and angle EFD. So, angle DFG + angle EFD = 90 degrees.

But how can we relate these angles? Let me note that in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and create congruent triangles. So, triangle DGF and triangle DFE are congruent? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe using slopes or coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle to make it easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose DE is along the x-axis and DG is along the y-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

- Let’s say D is at (0, 0).

Since DEFG is a rectangle, then:

- Point E is along the x-axis, so E could be at (a, 0) for some a > 0.

- Point G is along the y-axis, so G is at (0, b) for some b > 0.

Then, since it's a rectangle, point F would be at (a, b), completing the rectangle.

So, coordinates:

D(0, 0), E(a, 0), F(a, b), G(0, b).

Now, angle EDF is the angle at D between points E, D, F. So, vector DE is from D to E: (a, 0) - (0,0) = (a, 0). Vector DF is from D to F: (a, b) - (0,0) = (a, b). So, angle between vectors DE and DF.

Similarly, angle DFG is the angle at F between points D, F, G. So, vector FD is from F to D: (-a, -b). Vector FG is from F to G: (0, b) - (a, b) = (-a, 0). So, angle between vectors FD and FG.

We can compute these angles using dot product.

First, angle EDF:

Vectors DE = (a, 0) and DF = (a, b).

Dot product: DE • DF = a*a + 0*b = a².

Magnitude of DE: |DE| = sqrt(a² + 0) = a.

Magnitude of DF: |DF| = sqrt(a² + b²).

So, cos(theta) = (a²)/(a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Thus, theta = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)).

Which simplifies to arctan(b/a), since tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = b/a. Wait, yes. Because if you imagine the right triangle formed by DE, DF, and the vertical component. Wait, actually, angle between DE and DF is such that tan(theta) = (opposite side)/adjacent side. Wait, in terms of the right triangle where DE is adjacent and the vertical component is opposite? Wait, maybe better to think of the slope.

Alternatively, since DE is along x-axis, DF goes up to (a,b). So, the angle between DE (along x-axis) and DF is the angle whose tangent is rise over run, which is b/a. Hence, tan(angle EDF) = b/a.

Similarly, angle DFG: at point F, between FD and FG.

Vector FD is from F to D: (-a, -b). Vector FG is from F to G: (-a, 0). Let me compute the angle between FD and FG.

Let me use vectors. The vectors are FD and FG.

Vector FD: from F to D is D - F = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b).

Vector FG: from F to G is G - F = (0 - a, b - b) = (-a, 0).

Compute the angle between these two vectors.

Dot product: (-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a² + 0 = a².

Magnitude of FD: sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²).

Magnitude of FG: sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a.

So cos(phi) = (a²)/(sqrt(a² + b²)*a) = a / sqrt(a² + b²), same as before.

Therefore, phi = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)), same as angle EDF. Therefore, angle DFG is equal to angle EDF?

Wait, but according to our previous calculation, angle EDF has tan(theta) = b/a, and angle DFG has cos(phi) = a / sqrt(a² + b²), which implies that tan(phi) is ?

Wait, let me think. Let me take phi as angle DFG. Let me compute tan(phi). Alternatively, since we know cos(phi) = a / sqrt(a² + b²), then sin(phi) would be sqrt(1 - (a²/(a² + b²))) = sqrt((b²)/(a² + b²)) = b / sqrt(a² + b²). Thus, tan(phi) = sin(phi)/cos(phi) = (b / sqrt(...)) / (a / sqrt(...)) ) = b/a. So tan(phi) = b/a. So angle DFG has tan(phi) = b/a, same as angle EDF. Therefore, angle EDF equals angle DFG?

Wait, but in that case, angle EDF = angle DFG. Therefore, their measures are equal. Therefore, 5x - 3 = 3x + 7. Solving for x:

5x - 3 = 3x + 7  
Subtract 3x: 2x - 3 = 7  
Add 3: 2x = 10  
Divide by 2: x = 5  

Then, plug back into angle EDF: 5x - 3 = 5*5 -3 = 25 -3 = 22. So answer would be 22, which is option A. But wait, let me verify this conclusion because it seems straightforward, but I want to make sure there isn't a mistake in assuming angle EDF equals angle DFG.

Wait, earlier steps said that angle EDF and angle DFG have the same tangent, so they are equal? But in reality, angles could be supplementary if they are oriented differently, but in this case, since both angles are acute (as they are parts of the rectangle's angles), they must be equal. Because tan(theta) = tan(phi) and both angles are between 0 and 90 degrees, so they must be equal. Therefore, angle EDF = angle DFG. Hence, setting them equal gives x=5 and angle EDF=22, which is option A.

But wait, let me check once more with actual coordinates. Suppose a=3, b=4. Then tan(theta)=4/3, so angle EDF is arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13 degrees. Similarly, angle DFG would also be arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13 degrees. So indeed equal. Therefore, in general, angle EDF equals angle DFG. Therefore, solving 5x-3 = 3x+7 leads to x=5, giving angle EDF=22. So answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include 22 as option A. So the answer should be A. But wait, sometimes problems may have tricks. Let me check again.

Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and divide each other into halves. Also, the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. But in this case, angles EDF and DFG are equal. So the equations seem correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in identifying the angles. Let me re-examine the angles.

Angle EDF is at point D, between E, D, F. So, as per the coordinates, that is the angle between DE (horizontal) and DF (diagonal). Angle DFG is at point F, between D, F, G. So, at point F, between FD (which is the reverse of DF) and FG (which is horizontal leftward). So, angle between FD and FG. As computed earlier, this is the same as angle between DF and FG, but since FD is going towards D, and FG is going towards G. Depending on direction, but the angle itself is the same as angle between DF and FG, which would be same as angle EDF. So the equality holds.

Therefore, solving 5x -3 = 3x +7 gives x=5, leading to angle EDF=5*5-3=22. So answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include 22 as option A, so that would be the answer. However, let me check if there's any possibility that the angles are complementary or something else. For instance, in some cases, angles could add up to 90 degrees. But according to the coordinate analysis, they are equal. So if they were complementary, then 5x-3 + 3x +7 = 90 => 8x +4 =90 => 8x=86 => x=10.75, which would give angle EDF=5*10.75-3=53.75, which is not among the choices. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, if they were supplementary, 5x-3 + 3x+7=180 => 8x +4=180 => 8x=176 => x=22. Then angle EDF=5*22 -3=110-3=107, which is not among the choices either. So that's invalid.

Hence, the only valid solution is when angles are equal, leading to x=5 and angle EDF=22. Therefore, answer is A.

But wait, let me check once more for errors. Another way: since angle EDF and angle DFG are equal, and in the rectangle, the sum of angles around point D and F?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Since in the rectangle, the diagonals create angles that are equal. So, if we consider the diagonal DF, then in triangle DFG, angle at F is angle DFG, and in triangle DFE, angle at D is angle EDF. These two angles are equal because of the symmetry of the rectangle. So, they must be equal. Therefore, equating them gives x=5, leading to 22. So answer A.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle EDF $ in the given rectangle $ DEFG $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships within the shape.

---

### **Understanding the Geometry**

Given that **$ DEFG $** is a **rectangle**, all interior angles are **right angles (90°)**, and its diagonals **bisect each other and are congruent**. This means that the diagonals $ DF $ and $ EG $ intersect at the midpoint of each other.

We're told:
- $ \angle EDF = 5x - 3 $
- $ \angle DFG = 3x + 7 $

These angles are located at different vertices:
- $ \angle EDF $ is at vertex $ D $, formed between segments $ ED $ and $ DF $.
- $ \angle DFG $ is at vertex $ F $, formed between segments $ DF $ and $ FG $.

Because $ DF $ is a diagonal of the rectangle, and $ DE $ and $ FG $ are sides of the rectangle, the two angles $ \angle EDF $ and $ \angle DFG $ are **equal** due to the symmetry of the rectangle. This is because both angles involve the same diagonal and are formed with sides of the rectangle—hence, they are **vertically opposite angles** created by the diagonal, making them congruent.

---

### **Setting Up the Equation**

Since the two angles are equal:
$$
\angle EDF = \angle DFG
$$
$$
5x - 3 = 3x + 7
$$

Solving for $ x $:
$$
5x - 3 = 3x + 7 \\
2x = 10 \\
x = 5
$$

---

### **Calculating $ \angle EDF $**

Substitute $ x = 5 $ into the expression for $ \angle EDF $:
$$
\angle EDF = 5x - 3 = 5(5) - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the measure of $ \angle EDF $ is **22 degrees**, corresponding to **option A**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: A}}
$$
