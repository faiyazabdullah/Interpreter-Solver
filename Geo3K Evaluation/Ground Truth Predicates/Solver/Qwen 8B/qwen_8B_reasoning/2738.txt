MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points K, J, and L. The lengths between them are given: JK is 5 units, JL is 13 units, and KL is 12 units. Also, it says that line KL is perpendicular to line KJ. Wait, so that means angle at K is a right angle? Because KL and KJ are perpendicular. Let me visualize this.

So, if I imagine triangle KJL, with right angle at K. Because KL is perpendicular to KJ. So, triangle KJL is a right-angled triangle at K. Therefore, sides KJ = 5, KL = 12, and hypotenuse JL should be... wait, but they said JL is 13. Let me check if that makes sense. 

Using Pythagoras theorem for the right triangle: KJ² + KL² should equal JL². Let me compute that. 5 squared is 25, 12 squared is 144. Adding those gives 25 + 144 = 169. And 13 squared is 169. Perfect, so that checks out. So triangle KJL is a right-angled triangle with legs 5 and 12, hypotenuse 13. 

Now, the question asks for the ratio of tan L, expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. So, angle L is one of the acute angles in the triangle. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. But which angle is L here?

Points are K, J, L. The triangle has vertices K, J, L. The right angle is at K. So angle L is at point L. Let me sketch mentally. Point K is the right angle. So, sides: KJ is one leg (length 5), KL is another leg (length 12), and hypotenuse JL (length 13). So angle at L is opposite to side KJ. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In triangle KJL, angle L is at vertex L. To find tan L, we need to figure out the opposite and adjacent sides relative to angle L. In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. Since the right angle is at K, then angles at J and L are complementary. 

Let me label the triangle properly. Let me consider angle L. At vertex L, the sides forming the angle are LJ and LK. Wait, but since it's a right-angled triangle at K, the sides adjacent to angle L would be the ones connected to L. Let me try to break it down:

In triangle KJL, right-angled at K. So:

- Side opposite angle L: that would be KJ. Because angle L is at point L, so the side opposite is KJ, which is length 5.

Wait, no. Wait, angle L is at point L. The sides adjacent to angle L are the two sides that meet at L, which are LK and LJ. Wait, but the side opposite angle L is KJ. Because in triangle notation, each angle is opposite the corresponding side. For example, angle L is opposite side KJ. Because side KJ connects points K and J, so it's opposite angle L. 

Therefore, tan(angle L) is opposite over adjacent. Opposite is KJ = 5. Adjacent is... the side adjacent to angle L would be the other leg, which is KL. Wait, because angle L is at point L, so the adjacent side would be the side that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of tangent. In a right-angled triangle, for angle L, the tangent is the length of the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. The opposite side is the side that's across from angle L, which is KJ = 5. The adjacent side is the side that is next to angle L, which is KL = 12. Wait, but KL is one of the legs. Wait, but angle L is at point L. So, angle L is formed by sides LK and LJ. Therefore, the sides adjacent to angle L would be LK and LJ? No, the adjacent side is the one that is next to the angle, not including the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing terms.

Let me recall: in a right-angled triangle, for a given angle (not the right angle), the tangent is (opposite / adjacent). Where:

- Opposite side is the side opposite the angle.

- Adjacent side is the side that is adjacent to the angle and not the hypotenuse.

So, for angle L, the opposite side is KJ (since it's opposite angle L). The adjacent side is KL (since it's adjacent to angle L). Therefore, tan(L) = opposite / adjacent = KJ / KL = 5/12 ≈ 0.4166..., which is approximately 0.42 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. 

But let me confirm once more. Alternatively, maybe I got the opposite and adjacent mixed up. Let me think about the triangle again.

Imagine right angle at K. So, points K, J, L with right angle at K. Then, angle at L: the sides forming angle L are LK and LJ. The side opposite angle L is KJ. So yes, opposite is KJ=5. The adjacent side would be the side that is adjacent to angle L, which is LK=12. So tan(L)=5/12≈0.416666...

Which is approximately 0.42 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 0.42. So that would be the answer. However, let me make sure there isn't a different interpretation.

Wait, could angle L be referring to something else? Or maybe I misassigned the opposite and adjacent sides? Let me double-check using coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points will help.

Let me place point K at the origin (0,0). Since KL is perpendicular to KJ, let me assume that KJ is along the x-axis and KL is along the y-axis. So:

- Point K is at (0,0).

- Since KJ is 5 units long, and assuming it's along the x-axis, point J is at (5,0).

- KL is 12 units long, perpendicular to KJ, so along the y-axis. Therefore, point L is at (0,12).

Then, the distance between J (5,0) and L (0,12) is sqrt((5-0)^2 + (0-12)^2) = sqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = 13, which matches the given length JL=13. So coordinates are consistent.

Now, angle L is at point L (0,12). Let me find tan(L). To compute tan(L), we can consider the slope of the lines forming angle L. At point L, the two sides are LK and LJ. 

LK goes from L(0,12) to K(0,0), which is straight down along the y-axis. LJ goes from L(0,12) to J(5,0). So angle L is between the vertical line LK (along negative y-axis) and the line LJ going to J(5,0). 

To find tan(L), we can think about the angle between these two lines. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, we can compute the angle using vectors or slopes.

Alternatively, in triangle KJL, angle at L. Using trigonometry, in the right triangle, tan(angle L) is opposite over adjacent. As earlier, opposite is KJ = 5, adjacent is KL = 12. Therefore tan(L) = 5/12 ≈ 0.416666...

Another way: in coordinate system, vector from L to K is (0-0, 0-12) = (0,-12). Vector from L to J is (5-0, 0-12) = (5,-12). The angle at L is between these two vectors. To find tan(theta), where theta is the angle between these two vectors. But how do we calculate that?

The formula for tan(theta) between two vectors u and v can be complex, but since we know the triangle is right-angled, perhaps we can use the triangle's sides. Wait, but perhaps easier to use the coordinates to find the angle. 

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates, we can compute the slope of line LJ. From L(0,12) to J(5,0): the slope is (0-12)/(5-0) = -12/5. The angle that line LJ makes with the horizontal axis is arctangent of (-12/5). But since we're looking at angle L, which is between the vertical line LK (which is straight down, i.e., along negative y-axis) and the line LJ. So, perhaps we can find the angle between the vertical line and line LJ.

Alternatively, considering the angle at L, which is between the vertical line (from L down to K) and the line to J. If we imagine standing at point L, facing towards K (downwards along the y-axis), then turning towards J, which is to the right and downward. The angle between the downward direction and the line to J. 

The slope of line LJ is -12/5, meaning for every 5 units right, it drops 12 units down. So, the angle between the vertical line (which is 90 degrees from the horizontal) and line LJ. Let me denote that angle as theta (angle L). 

If we consider the slope of line LJ, which is rise over run, but since it's going down, the slope is -12/5. The angle that line LJ makes with the horizontal axis is arctan(-12/5). But since we are interested in the angle between the vertical line (which is 90 degrees from horizontal) and the line LJ, we can think of it as follows:

Let’s call phi the angle that line LJ makes with the horizontal. Then phi = arctan(|slope|) = arctan(12/5). Then, the angle between the vertical line and line LJ would be 90° - phi. Therefore, tan(angle L) = tan(90° - phi) = cot(phi) = 1/tan(phi) = 5/12. Which confirms our previous calculation. Thus, tan(L) = 5/12 ≈ 0.416666..., which rounds to 0.42. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option B is 0.42. Hence, the correct answer should be B.

Wait, just to ensure there's no confusion. Another approach: using the right triangle, angle L is adjacent to side KL (length 12) and opposite to side KJ (length 5). Therefore tan(L) = opposite / adjacent = 5 / 12 ≈ 0.416666... Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 0.42. Yes, that's correct. 

So, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\tan L$ in the given geometric configuration, we begin by analyzing the structure of the triangle defined by the points $K$, $J$, and $L$. We are told:

- $JK = 5$
- $KL = 12$
- $JL = 13$
- $\angle K$ is a **right angle** (i.e., $\overline{KL} \perp \overline{KJ}$)

This implies that triangle $KJL$ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at $K$. The side lengths $JK = 5$, $KL = 12$, and $JL = 13$ satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
JK^2 + KL^2 = JL^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 25 + 144 = 169
$$

Thus, the triangle is valid and right-angled at $K$. Now, we want to evaluate:

$$
\tan(\angle L)
$$

### Step 1: Understand the Triangle Setup

We consider triangle $KJL$ with the right angle at $K$. This places the triangle such that:

- Side $JK$ lies on one leg,
- Side $KL$ lies on the other leg,
- Hypotenuse $JL$ connects $J$ and $L$.

Angle $L$ is at vertex $L$, so the **opposite** side to $\angle L$ is segment $JK$ (length 5), and the **adjacent** side is segment $KL$ (length 12).

---

### Step 2: Use Trigonometric Definition

For a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Applying this to $\angle L$:

$$
\tan(\angle L) = \frac{JK}{KL} = \frac{5}{12}
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute and Round the Value

$$
\frac{5}{12} \approx 0.416666\ldots
$$

Rounded to the **nearest hundredth**, this becomes:

$$
\tan(\angle L) \approx 0.42
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
