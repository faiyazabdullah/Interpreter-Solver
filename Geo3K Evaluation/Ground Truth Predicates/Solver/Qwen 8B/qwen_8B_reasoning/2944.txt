====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So we have quadrilateral WXYZ which is supposed to be a rectangle. We need to find the measure of angle 2, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles.

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions various angles labeled 1 through 12, so maybe these aren't the angles of the rectangle itself but other angles formed by lines or intersections?

Wait, the problem states that Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. So points W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle. Let me visualize that. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all interior angles are 90 degrees. Also, diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length.

But there are several angles mentioned here, like angle 1, angle 2, etc., which might be angles formed by intersecting lines or something else. Let me check the given constraints again.

The constraints list several equalities between angles. For example:

- Angle at W, A, X equals angle 11
- Angle at A, W, Y equals angle 7
- And so on... up to angle 12.

Also, there are points lying on certain lines. Point A lies on line ZW and line YX. Also, lines YZ and YW are perpendicular.

Hmm, point A seems to be a significant point here. Since it's on both line ZW and line YX, perhaps A is the intersection point of those two lines? Wait, but in a rectangle, lines ZW and YX would be opposite sides? Wait, no. Let me think about how the rectangle is structured.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose rectangle WXYZ has vertices W, X, Y, Z. Assuming standard labeling, moving around the rectangle. Let's say W is connected to X and Z, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, and Z connected back to W. So, for example, sides WX, XY, YZ, and ZW.

Now, point A lies on line ZW and line YX. So line ZW is one side of the rectangle (from Z to W). Line YX is another side? Wait, line YX connects Y to X. If A is on both ZW and YX, then A is their intersection point. But since ZW is a side of the rectangle and YX is another side. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides meet at corners. So if lines ZW and YX are sides of the rectangle, they might only intersect at a vertex. But if A is a different point, then maybe lines ZW and YX are extended beyond their endpoints?

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not the sides but other lines. Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z, W)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X)). So A is somewhere along the line connecting Z to W and also along the line connecting Y to X. Therefore, A is the intersection point of lines ZW and YX. But in a rectangle, unless these lines are extended, they might not intersect except at vertices. For example, if ZW is a side from Z to W, and YX is a side from Y to X. Depending on the rectangle's structure, these lines could be non-intersecting unless extended.

So perhaps lines ZW and YX are extended beyond their original segments to intersect at point A. That makes sense. So point A is outside the rectangle, located at the intersection of lines ZW and YX.

Additionally, there's a condition that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. Wait, line YZ is a side of the rectangle (since Y is connected to Z) and line YW connects Y to W. Wait, but in the rectangle, Y is connected to X and Z. So line YW would be a diagonal from Y to W. Because W is connected to Z and X. So in the rectangle, if you connect Y to W, that's a diagonal. Then line YZ is a side of the rectangle (from Y to Z). The problem states that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. However, the diagonal YW would make an angle with side YZ. Unless the rectangle is a square, but not necessarily. Wait, but if YZ and YW are perpendicular, that implies that the diagonal YW is perpendicular to side YZ. Which would mean that triangle YZW is a right triangle with right angle at Y. But in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. Wait, if YZ is a side and YW is a diagonal, then in a rectangle, the diagonal YW would split the rectangle into two congruent triangles. However, the angle between YZ and YW would depend on the rectangle's proportions.

Wait, but according to the constraint, lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. That suggests that angle between YZ and YW is 90 degrees. But in a rectangle, that would only happen if the rectangle is a square? Or maybe not. Let me think. Suppose rectangle WXYZ with sides YZ and YW. Wait, YW isn't a side. Wait, YZ is a side, and YW is a diagonal. So if YZ and YW are perpendicular, then that would imply that the diagonal YW is perpendicular to side YZ, making triangle YZW a right triangle with legs YZ and YW. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonal YW can't be perpendicular to the side YZ unless the rectangle is degenerate, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be. There's a contradiction here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z), Line(Y,W)). So line YZ and line YW are perpendicular. Line YZ is the same as segment YZ, and line YW is the same as segment YW. So in the rectangle, line YZ is horizontal (assuming standard orientation) and line YW is a diagonal. For them to be perpendicular, the slope of YZ times the slope of YW should be -1.

But in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. For instance, YZ is vertical (if Y is at bottom left, Z at bottom right, etc.), and YW would be a diagonal going to W. Wait, maybe I need to assign coordinates to figure out.

Let me try assigning coordinates to the rectangle to model this. Let me assume coordinates for clarity. Let me place point Y at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose Y is at origin. Then, since YZ is a side, let's say Z is at (a, 0) because YZ is horizontal. Then, since it's a rectangle, X would be at (0, b) if YX is vertical. Wait, but the rectangle's sides are YZ and YX. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if Y is connected to Z and to X, then YZ and YX are perpendicular. But according to the problem, line YZ and line YW are perpendicular. So line YW must be perpendicular to YZ. So line YW is perpendicular to YZ, which is horizontal (as per my assumption). Thus, line YW would be vertical. But YW connects Y(0,0) to W. If YW is vertical, then W must lie along the vertical line passing through Y. But in a rectangle, W is connected to Z and X. Wait, if Y is at (0,0), Z is at (a, 0), X is at (0, b), then W would be at (a, b), completing the rectangle. Then line YW connects Y(0,0) to W(a,b). The slope of YW is (b-0)/(a-0) = b/a. The slope of YZ is (0 - 0)/(a - 0) = 0, i.e., horizontal. For these two lines to be perpendicular, the product of slopes must be -1. But slope of YZ is 0, and slope of YW is b/a. Their product is 0 * (b/a) = 0 ≠ -1. Therefore, this contradicts the given condition that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. Hence, my coordinate assignment must be wrong.

Ah! So my initial assumption about the positions of the points may be incorrect. Let me re-examine.

Given that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. So YZ is a side of the rectangle, and YW is another line starting at Y. So in the rectangle, Y is connected to Z and to X. So Y is connected to two adjacent vertices. But YW is a line from Y to W. So W is another vertex of the rectangle. Therefore, in the rectangle, W is connected to Y via a side or a diagonal?

Wait, in a rectangle, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. So if the rectangle is W, X, Y, Z, then the order is such that each consecutive pair is connected. For example, W connected to X and Z; X connected to Y; Y connected to Z; Z connected to W. Wait, but then Y is connected to Z and X. So line YZ is a side, and line YX is another side. Then, line YW would be a diagonal connecting Y to W. Therefore, in that case, YW is a diagonal. But earlier calculation shows that in standard rectangle, the diagonal YW is not perpendicular to side YZ. So how can that be?

Therefore, there must be something wrong with my understanding of the rectangle's configuration. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not convex? No, rectangles are always convex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Maybe the order of the letters is different. Maybe it's W, X, Y, Z arranged such that Y is connected to X and Z, but W is connected to X and Z. Wait, that might not hold. Let me consider another approach.

Since lines YZ and YW are perpendicular, and Y is a common point. So line YZ is one side of the rectangle, and line YW is another line starting at Y. Since W is a vertex of the rectangle, then YW must be either a side or a diagonal. If it's a side, then YW would be adjacent to Y, but in a rectangle, each vertex is connected to two sides. So if Y is connected to Z and X, then YW cannot be a side. Therefore, YW must be a diagonal. But then, in that case, the diagonal YW is perpendicular to side YZ. How can that happen?

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other but are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. But in a general rectangle, they are not. So if the rectangle is a square, then diagonals are perpendicular. But if YW is a diagonal and YZ is a side, then for them to be perpendicular, the rectangle must be a square. Therefore, the rectangle is a square. But the problem does not state that it's a square, just a rectangle. However, given that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular, that would force the rectangle to be a square. Therefore, maybe we can proceed under the assumption that it's a square, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the position of the points. Let me try assigning coordinates again, considering that YZ and YW are perpendicular.

Let me place point Y at (0, 0). Let me assume that line YZ is along the x-axis, so point Z is at (a, 0). Now, line YW is perpendicular to YZ, so it must be vertical. Therefore, line YW is vertical, so point W lies somewhere along the y-axis. But since W is a vertex of the rectangle, connected to X and Z. Wait, if W is on the y-axis, then its coordinates would be (0, c) for some c. But in the rectangle, W is connected to Z and X. So if Z is at (a, 0), and W is at (0, c), then side ZW connects (a, 0) to (0, c). Also, since it's a rectangle, the side WX must be connected to W. So point X would be connected to both W and Y. Since Y is at (0, 0), and X is connected to Y and to Z? Wait, no. Earlier, I thought Y was connected to Z and X. If W is at (0, c), then X would be connected to W and Y? Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to define the rectangle properly.

Assuming that the rectangle has vertices W, X, Y, Z in order. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, the connections are:

- W connected to X and Z

- X connected to W and Y

- Y connected to X and Z

- Z connected to Y and W

So if Y is connected to X and Z, then line YX and line YZ are sides of the rectangle meeting at Y. Now, line YZ is one side (YZ), and line YW is another line starting at Y. Since W is connected to X and Z, then line YW connects Y to W. So in this case, line YW would be a diagonal from Y to W.

So in this setup, if line YZ is a horizontal side (say, from Y(0,0) to Z(a, 0)), and line YW is a diagonal from Y(0,0) to W(b, c). For these two lines to be perpendicular, the vectors YZ and YW must be perpendicular. Vector YZ is (a, 0), vector YW is (b, c). Their dot product is a*b + 0*c = ab. For them to be perpendicular, ab = 0. So either a=0 or b=0. But a is the length of YZ, which can't be zero. Therefore, b=0. So point W would have x-coordinate 0. Therefore, W is at (0, c). 

But W is connected to Z and X. So Z is at (a, 0), and W is at (0, c). Then, the side ZW connects (a, 0) to (0, c). Also, since W is connected to X, point X must be connected to W and Y. Since Y is at (0, 0), and X is connected to Y and W. So let's find coordinates of X. Since X is connected to Y(0,0) and W(0,c). So X lies somewhere along the line from Y(0,0) to W(0,c)? No, because X is connected to both Y and W. Wait, if W is at (0,c), and X is connected to Y(0,0) and W(0,c), then X must be along the line connecting Y and W. But in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if Y is connected to X and Z, then the sides YX and YZ are perpendicular. Since YZ is horizontal (from Y(0,0) to Z(a, 0)), then YX must be vertical. So YX is vertical, meaning X is at (0, d) for some d. But since X is also connected to W(0,c), then X must be at (0, c) if it's connected to both Y and W. Wait, but then X would coincide with W, which is impossible. Therefore, there's inconsistency here.

This suggests that my assumptions are leading to contradictions. Perhaps the problem involves more than just the rectangle's sides and requires looking at the angles defined by point A?

Let me recall that point A lies on both line ZW and line YX. Also, there are multiple angle equalities involving angles 1 to 12. Given that angle 1 is 30 degrees, and we need to find angle 2.

Maybe instead of trying to assign coordinates, I should focus on the given angle relationships and use properties of rectangles and transversal lines.

Let me note down all the given angle equalities:

1. ∠(W, A, X) = angle 11
2. ∠(A, W, Y) = angle 7
3. ∠(W, Y, A) = angle 6
4. ∠(X, W, Z) = angle 8
5. ∠(X, A, Z) = angle 10
6. ∠(Y, A, W) = angle 9
7. ∠(W, Z, X) = angle 3
8. ∠(A, X, W) = angle 1 (given as 30)
9. ∠(X, Y, Z) = angle 5
10. ∠(Y, Z, A) = angle 4
11. ∠(Z, A, Y) = angle 12
12. ∠(Z, X, Y) = angle 2

We need to find angle 2, given that angle 1 is 30°.

Since WXYZ is a rectangle, all its internal angles are 90°, and opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Point A is the intersection of lines ZW and YX. So lines ZW and YX intersect at point A. Also, lines YZ and YW are perpendicular.

Let me try to draw this scenario. Imagine rectangle WXYZ. Lines YX and ZW intersect at point A. Also, line YZ is perpendicular to line YW.

Perhaps using triangle properties or considering triangle YAW, since YZ ⊥ YW, so triangle YZW is a right triangle at Y. Wait, if YZ ⊥ YW, then triangle YZW has a right angle at Y. But in the rectangle, YZ is a side, and YW is a diagonal. So triangle YZW is a right triangle with legs YZ and YW, and hypotenuse ZW. Wait, but in reality, in a rectangle, the diagonal ZW would have length sqrt(YZ² + YW²)? Wait no, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and each diagonal splits the rectangle into two congruent right triangles. Wait, if YZ is one side, then the diagonal from Y to W would be part of that triangle. Wait, maybe I need to consider specific triangles here.

Alternatively, since lines YZ and YW are perpendicular, then at point Y, the lines YZ and YW form a right angle. But in the rectangle, the sides at Y are YX and YZ, which are already perpendicular. So if YW is another line from Y, making a right angle with YZ, then YW must be aligned with YX? Because YX is already perpendicular to YZ. Wait, but YX is a side of the rectangle, so if YW is aligned with YX, then W would be along YX. But W is another vertex of the rectangle. This seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe YW is the extension of YX? Like, if YX is extended beyond X to point W? But in that case, W wouldn't be a vertex of the rectangle. This is confusing.

Let me try focusing on the angles given. The key is that angle 1 is 30°, which is ∠(A, X, W). So angle at point X between A and W. Let me try to imagine that. Point A is on line YX and line ZW. So if I consider point A on line YX, then angle at X between A and W would involve lines XA and XW. Similarly, since A is on ZW, XA is a line from X to A, and XW is a line from X to W.

But without knowing exact positions, it's hard to tell. Maybe using the fact that in rectangle WXYZ, opposite sides are parallel. For example, WX is parallel to YZ, and XY is parallel to ZW.

Since point A lies on line ZW and line YX, which are two lines that intersect at A. So lines ZW and YX are not parallel (they intersect at A), hence forming vertical angles and others.

Given that, maybe we can look at triangle AXW or similar triangles.

But given the complexity, perhaps using the given angle measures and the fact that WXYZ is a rectangle, we can derive relations between the angles.

Let me note that angle 1 is ∠(A, X, W) = 30°. This is the angle at point X between points A and W. So ∠AXW = 30°.

Similarly, other angles relate to other points. For instance, angle 11 is ∠(W, A, X), which is the angle at A between W and X. So ∠WAX = angle 11.

Given that, perhaps using triangle properties. Let me consider triangle AWX. In this triangle, we know one angle (∠AXW = 30°), and possibly other angles related to the rectangle.

But since WXYZ is a rectangle, line WX is one side, and line YX is another side. Since A is on line YX, then line XA is part of line YX. So point A lies on line YX, which means that line XA is colinear with YX. Therefore, in triangle AWX, side XA is along YX, and side XW is the side of the rectangle.

Wait, if I consider triangle AWX, with XA being along YX, and XW being the side of the rectangle. Also, since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle at X between YX and WX is 90°, because it's a corner of the rectangle. So ∠YXW = 90°. But since A is on line YX, then ∠AXW is part of that 90° angle. Specifically, ∠AXW = 30°, as given. Therefore, the remaining angle at X in triangle AWX would be ∠AWX = 90° - 30° = 60°.

Wait, let me clarify. At point X, in the rectangle, the angle between YX and WX is 90°, since it's a right angle. Point A lies on line YX, so the line XA is extending from X along YX. So the angle between XA and XW is 90° minus the angle between XA and YX? Wait, no. Wait, if you're at point X, looking along YX towards A, and looking along WX, then the angle between XA and XW is the angle between YX and WX, which is 90°. But since A is on YX, then the angle between XA and XW is still 90°, but the given angle is ∠AXW = 30°. Wait, this seems contradictory unless I misunderstood the notation.

Wait, angle AXW is the angle at point X between points A, X, W. So it's formed by lines XA and XW. Since A is on line YX, then XA is a segment of YX. So the angle between XA (which is along YX) and XW (which is the side of the rectangle) is the same as the angle between YX and WX, which is 90°. But the problem states that this angle is 30°, which suggests that my previous assumption is wrong.

This indicates that my understanding of where point A is located might be incorrect. Let me reconsider.

If angle AXW = 30°, and in the rectangle, at point X, the angle between YX and WX is 90°, then if A is on line YX, the angle between XA (which is along YX) and XW would be 90°, but the problem says it's 30°. This discrepancy suggests that point A is not on the line segment YX but on its extension. So, perhaps A is on the extension of YX beyond X or beyond Y.

Let me assume that A is on the extension of YX beyond X. So line YX extends past X to point A. Then, at point X, the angle between XA (which is along the extension of YX) and XW (the side of the rectangle) would be supplementary to the 90° angle of the rectangle. Wait, if A is on the extension of YX beyond X, then the direction from X to A is opposite to YX. So the angle between XA and XW would be 180° - 90° = 90°, still not matching 30°. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A is on the extension of YX beyond Y. Then, at point X, the line XA goes from X to A, which is in the opposite direction of YX. So the angle between XA and XW would still be 90°, unless XA is not along YX. Wait, but A is on line YX, so XA is part of line YX. This is very confusing.

Wait, perhaps my entire approach is flawed. Let me try another way. Since we have multiple angles defined, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point A, or within triangles, will help.

Given that angle 1 is 30°, which is ∠(A, X, W) = 30°, and point A is the intersection of lines ZW and YX. Let me consider triangle AWX. In this triangle, we have angle at X: ∠AXW = 30°, and we might find other angles based on the rectangle's properties.

But to do that, I need more information about the other angles or sides. Let me consider the other constraints.

Another given is that lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. Let me try to use this. Since YZ is a side of the rectangle, and YW is a line from Y to W. Since YW is perpendicular to YZ, then as previously discussed, this imposes a relationship between the rectangle's sides.

Let me assign coordinates again, carefully this time. Let me set up a coordinate system where Y is at (0, 0). Since YZ and YW are perpendicular, let me align YZ along the x-axis and YW along the y-axis.

So, point Y is at (0, 0). Line YZ is along the x-axis, so point Z is at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Line YW is along the y-axis, so point W is at (0, b) for some b > 0.

Now, since WXYZ is a rectangle, we need to determine the coordinates of X. In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. Since W is connected to X and Z, and Z is at (a, 0), W is at (0, b). To find X, we need to ensure that the sides WX and YZ are equal and parallel, and sides XY and WZ are equal and parallel.

Vector YZ is from Y(0,0) to Z(a,0): vector (a, 0). In a rectangle, vector WX should be equal to vector YZ. Vector WX is from W(0,b) to X(x,y). So vector WX = (x - 0, y - b) = (x, y - b). This should equal vector YZ (a, 0). So:

x = a  
y - b = 0 ⇒ y = b  

Thus, point X is at (a, b).

Now, we can verify other sides. Side XY should be equal and parallel to WZ. Vector WZ is from W(0,b) to Z(a,0): (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b). Vector XY is from X(a,b) to Y(0,0): (-a, -b). These vectors are negatives of each other, so they are equal in magnitude and direction? No, they are negatives, so they are parallel but opposite directions. Which is fine for a rectangle.

Now, we have all four points:

- Y: (0,0)
- Z: (a,0)
- W: (0,b)
- X: (a,b)

This forms a rectangle with sides YZ = a, YW = b, and diagonals of length sqrt(a² + b²).

Now, point A lies on both line ZW and line YX.

First, let's find equations of lines ZW and YX.

Line ZW connects Z(a,0) to W(0,b). Its parametric equation can be written as:

x = a - a*t  
y = 0 + b*t  
for t ∈ [0,1]

Or in slope-intercept form, the line ZW goes from (a,0) to (0,b). Slope is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. Equation: y = (-b/a)(x - a) → y = (-b/a)x + b.

Line YX connects Y(0,0) to X(a,b). Slope is (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a. Equation: y = (b/a)x.

Point A is the intersection of lines ZW and YX. Let's find coordinates of A by solving the two equations:

From YX: y = (b/a)x  
From ZW: y = (-b/a)x + b  

Setting equal:

(b/a)x = (-b/a)x + b  
Multiply both sides by a:

bx = -bx + ab  
bx + bx = ab  
2bx = ab  
x = a/2  

Then y = (b/a)(a/2) = b/2  

So point A is at (a/2, b/2). Wait, but that's the center of the rectangle! Because the midpoint of the rectangle's diagonals is at (a/2, b/2). So point A is the center of the rectangle. Interesting!

Now, let's verify this with the given conditions. The problem states that Perpendicular(Line(Y,Z), Line(Y,W)). In our coordinate system, Line(Y,Z) is along x-axis (from Y(0,0) to Z(a,0)), and Line(Y,W) is along y-axis (from Y(0,0) to W(0,b)). These are indeed perpendicular, as expected. So this satisfies the condition.

Great, now that we have coordinates for all points, including A, we can compute all the angles mentioned.

Now, the goal is to find the measure of angle 2, which is ∠(Z, X, Y). Wait, according to the given, angle 2 is ∠(Z, X, Y), which is the angle at point X between points Z and Y. Wait, no. The notation ∠(Z, X, Y) is the angle at point X between points Z, X, Y. Wait, but point Z is at (a, 0), X is at (a,b), and Y is at (0,0). So the angle at X between Z and Y.

Wait, but in the rectangle, at point X, the sides are XW and XY. Let me calculate that angle.

At point X(a,b), the lines are:

- From X to Z: line XZ, which goes from (a,b) to Z(a,0). This is a vertical line downward.

- From X to Y: line XY, which goes from (a,b) to Y(0,0). This is a diagonal line.

Wait, the angle at X between Z and Y would be between XZ and XY. Let me compute this angle.

Vector XZ is from X(a,b) to Z(a,0): (a - a, 0 - b) = (0, -b)

Vector XY is from X(a,b) to Y(0,0): (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b)

To find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cosθ = (v · w)/(|v| |w|)

Where v = (0, -b), w = (-a, -b)

Compute v · w = 0*(-a) + (-b)*(-b) = b²

|v| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = b

|w| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²)

So cosθ = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, θ = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arcsin(a / sqrt(a² + b²)) ?

Wait, alternatively, tanθ = (opposite/adjacent). Let me think. If I imagine the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from X to YZ, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since we know the angle at X between XZ and XY, which is angle ZX Y. Wait, but in the rectangle, at point X, the angle between XZ and XY is actually the angle between the vertical line XZ and the diagonal XY. Let me see.

But in our coordinate system, this angle is θ = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)). But we need to find the measure of angle 2, which is this angle. However, we don't know the values of a and b. But maybe we can find it using the given angle 1 = 30°.

Angle 1 is ∠(A, X, W), which is the angle at X between points A, X, W. Let's compute this.

Point A is at (a/2, b/2), X is at (a,b), W is at (0,b).

So vectors involved in angle AXW are:

- From X to A: A - X = (a/2 - a, b/2 - b) = (-a/2, -b/2)

- From X to W: W - X = (0 - a, b - b) = (-a, 0)

So the angle at X between XA and XW is angle AXW, which is given as 30°.

Let me compute this angle using the dot product.

Vectors:

XA: (-a/2, -b/2)

XW: (-a, 0)

Dot product: (-a/2)(-a) + (-b/2)(0) = a²/2 + 0 = a²/2

Magnitude of XA: sqrt[ (-a/2)^2 + (-b/2)^2 ] = sqrt( a²/4 + b²/4 ) = (sqrt(a² + b²))/2

Magnitude of XW: sqrt[ (-a)^2 + 0^2 ] = a

So cos(theta) = (a²/2) / [ (sqrt(a² + b²)/2) * a ] = (a²/2) / [ (a sqrt(a² + b²))/2 ] = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, theta = arccos( a / sqrt(a² + b²) )

But this angle is given as 30°, so:

arccos( a / sqrt(a² + b²) ) = 30°

Which implies:

a / sqrt(a² + b²) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2

Square both sides:

a² / (a² + b²) = 3/4

Cross-multiplying:

4a² = 3a² + 3b²  
4a² - 3a² = 3b²  
a² = 3b²  
=> a = b√3

So the ratio of a to b is √3 : 1.

Now, recall that we needed to find angle 2, which is the angle at X between Z and Y, which we earlier determined as θ = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)).

Substituting a = b√3:

sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(3b² + b²) = sqrt(4b²) = 2b

So b / (2b) = 1/2

Therefore, angle 2 is arccos(1/2) = 60°.

Hence, the measure of angle 2 is 60 degrees, which corresponds to option B.

Let me double-check this conclusion.

Given that a = b√3, the rectangle is such that the length of YZ (which is a) is √3 times the length of YW (which is b). Therefore, the rectangle is not a square but has sides in the ratio √3:1. This results in the angle at X between Z and Y being 60°, which matches our calculation.

Therefore, the answer should be B. 60 degrees.
