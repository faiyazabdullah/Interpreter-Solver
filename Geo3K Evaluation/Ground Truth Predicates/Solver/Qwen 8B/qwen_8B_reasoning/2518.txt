MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points V, W, and X. The lengths between them are given: VW is 72 units, WX is 21 units, and VX is 75 units. Also, the lines WV and WX are perpendicular. We need to find the cosine of angle X, which I think refers to angle at point X in triangle VWX? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says "the ratio of cos X". In geometry, when they mention angle X without specifying, it's usually the angle at vertex X. But let me confirm the triangle here. The points involved are V, W, X. So triangle VWX. So angle X would be the angle at point X, between segments XV and XW. Wait, but the sides around that angle would be XV and XW. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle?

But first, let me sketch the scenario mentally. Points V, W, X. Given that WV is 72, WX is 21, and VX is 75. Also, WV and WX are perpendicular. Wait, so WV and WX are two sides meeting at point W, forming a right angle. Therefore, triangle VWX is a right-angled triangle at W? Because WV and WX are perpendicular. So the right angle is at W, meaning that triangle VWX is right-angled at W. Therefore, angle at W is 90 degrees. Then, the other angles are at V and X.

But the question asks for cos X, which is the cosine of angle at X. So in triangle VWX, angle at X. To find cos X, we can use the definition of cosine in a right-angled triangle. However, wait, since the triangle is right-angled at W, then the hypotenuse would be VX, which is given as 75. The legs are WV (72) and WX (21). So, angle at X is opposite to side WV, and adjacent to side WX. Wait, let me recall.

In a right-angled triangle, cosine of an angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. So, angle at X: adjacent side is the side next to angle X, which would be WX (since angle X is at point X, connected to points W and V). Wait, maybe I should draw the triangle.

Let me imagine triangle VWX with right angle at W. So, points:

- W is the right-angle vertex.

- From W, there's segment WV of length 72 going to V.

- From W, there's segment WX of length 21 going to X.

So, the triangle has vertices W, V, X, with right angle at W. Then, the hypotenuse is VX, which connects V and X, and its length is 75. Now, angle at X is angle between sides XW and XV. So, in terms of the triangle, angle X is at vertex X. Let me think about how to compute cos(X).

Alternatively, using coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to each point to make it clearer.

Let me place point W at the origin (0, 0). Since WV and WX are perpendicular, let's take WV along the y-axis and WX along the x-axis.

Therefore:

- Point W: (0, 0)

- Point V is along the y-axis, so coordinates (0, 72) because WV = 72.

- Point X is along the x-axis, so coordinates (21, 0) because WX = 21.

Now, point V is at (0, 72), point X is at (21, 0). So, the distance between V and X is sqrt[(21 - 0)^2 + (0 - 72)^2] = sqrt[441 + 5184] = sqrt[5625] = 75. Which matches the given value. Good.

Now, we need to find cos(angle at X). So, angle at X is the angle between segments XW and XV. So, in coordinate terms, vector from X to W and vector from X to V.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates, perhaps we can calculate vectors and use dot product formula.

First, let's find vectors. At point X, the two sides are XW and XV.

Vector XW goes from X to W: W - X = (0 - 21, 0 - 0) = (-21, 0).

Vector XV goes from X to V: V - X = (0 - 21, 72 - 0) = (-21, 72).

The angle between these two vectors is angle at X. So, cos(theta) = (vector XW · vector XV) / (|XW| |XV| )

Compute the dot product:

(-21)(-21) + (0)(72) = 441 + 0 = 441.

|XW| is the magnitude of vector XW: sqrt((-21)^2 + 0^2) = 21.

|XV| is the magnitude of vector XV: sqrt((-21)^2 + 72^2) = sqrt(441 + 5184) = sqrt(5625) = 75.

Thus, cos(theta) = 441/(21*75) = 441 / 1575.

Simplify this fraction. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 21: 441 ÷21=21; 1575 ÷21=75. So 21/75. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 7/25. Which is 0.28. 

So cos(theta) is 0.28. Which corresponds to option A. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in choosing vectors.

Alternatively, sometimes angle between two lines can be considered differently. Let me verify.

Another approach: in triangle VWX, right-angled at W. So, angles at V and X are complementary. Let me consider standard trigonometric ratios.

In triangle VWX, right-angled at W. Hypotenuse VX = 75. Adjacent sides: WV = 72 and WX = 21.

For angle at X, the adjacent side is WX (length 21), and the hypotenuse is VX (75). Therefore, cos(angle X) = adjacent/hypotenuse = WX / VX = 21 / 75 = 0.28. Exactly same result. So that confirms it. So cos X is 21/75 = 0.28, which is option A. So answer is A. But let me check once more.

Wait, but sometimes people confuse adjacent and opposite. Let me make sure. For angle at X, which sides are adjacent and opposite.

In triangle VWX, angle at X. The sides relative to angle X:

- Opposite side: the side opposite to angle X is WV, which is 72.

- Adjacent side: the side adjacent to angle X is WX, which is 21.

Hypotenuse is VX, 75.

Therefore, cos(angle X) = adjacent / hypotenuse = WX / VX = 21 / 75 = 0.28. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, using Pythagorean theorem: 21² + 72² = 441 + 5184 = 5625 = 75², which checks out. So everything is consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 0.28, which is option A. Hence, the correct choice is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\cos X$, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are given three points $V$, $W$, and $X$ such that:

- $\text{Length}(WV) = 72$
- $\text{Length}(WX) = 21$
- $\text{Length}(VX) = 75$
- Lines $WV$ and $WX$ are **perpendicular**.

This means that triangle $VWX$ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at point $W$. Thus, the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Leg}_1^2 + \text{Leg}_2^2
$$

$$
75^2 = 72^2 + 21^2
$$

$$
5625 = 5184 + 441
$$

$$
5625 = 5625
$$

This verifies that the triangle is indeed right-angled at $W$.

---

### **Step 2: Determine What Needs to Be Found**

We are asked to compute $\cos X$, i.e., the cosine of the angle at point $X$ in triangle $VWX$.

In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as:

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

Here, angle $X$ lies at vertex $X$, and the two sides adjacent to it are:

- The leg adjacent to angle $X$: segment $WX$, which has length 21
- The hypotenuse: segment $VX$, which has length 75

So,

$$
\cos X = \frac{WX}{VX} = \frac{21}{75}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Value**

$$
\cos X = \frac{21}{75} = 0.28
$$

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this gives us:

$$
\cos X \approx 0.28
$$

---

### **Step 4: Match with Answer Choices**

Given the answer choices:

- A. 0.28  
- B. 0.29  
- C. 0.96  
- D. 3.43  

The value $0.28$ directly matches **option A**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
