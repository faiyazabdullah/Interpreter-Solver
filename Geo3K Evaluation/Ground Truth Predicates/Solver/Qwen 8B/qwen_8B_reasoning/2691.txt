====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points R, S, and Q. The problem gives us some equations about the lengths between these points. Let me write down what I know.

First, they say that the length of line RS is equal to 6x minus 5. Then, the length of line RQ is 5x. Also, the length of line SQ is 3x plus 10. Then there are two more constraints: the length of RS equals the length of RQ, and the length of RQ equals the length of SQ. Wait, so all three lengths are equal? Because RS = RQ and RQ = SQ, so RS = RQ = SQ?

So, if that's the case, then all those expressions should be equal. Let me set them up as equations.

From the first constraint: Length(RS) = 6x - 5
Second: Length(RQ) = 5x
Third: Length(SQ) = 3x + 10

Then, since Length(RS) = Length(RQ), so 6x - 5 = 5x. Let me solve for x here. Subtract 5x from both sides: 6x -5x -5 = 0 → x -5 = 0 → x = 5. Hmm, but wait, then I need to check if that also satisfies the third equation where Length(RQ) = Length(SQ). So substituting x=5 into Length(RQ) which is 5x would be 25. And Length(SQ) is 3x +10, so 3*5 +10 = 15 +10 = 25. Oh, okay, so that works! So x=5 makes all three lengths equal to 25. 

But the question asks for QS. Wait, QS is the same as SQ, right? Since distance between Q and S is the same as S and Q. So Length(SQ) is 3x +10. If x=5, then 3*5 +10 = 15 +10 = 25. But looking at the answer choices, option D is 25. However, let me make sure I didn't misread anything. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. 

The problem says "Find Q S." Which probably means the length of QS. So according to our calculation, when x=5, QS is 25. So answer D. But let me check again. 

Alternatively, could there be another way? Suppose that the points are arranged in a certain way, like colinear? For example, maybe R, S, Q are on a straight line? But the problem doesn't specify the configuration. However, the constraints are purely algebraic, so maybe it's just based on the equations given. 

Let me re-express the problem. All three lengths are equal:

RS = RQ = SQ. Therefore, each expression must equal the same value. So 6x -5 = 5x = 3x +10. 

We already solved 6x -5 = 5x leading to x=5. Then checking 5x vs 3x +10: 5*5=25, 3*5 +10=25. Yes, that matches. So x=5. Then QS is 3x +10 = 25. So the answer is D. 

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "Find Q S." Maybe there's a typo and they meant something else? Or perhaps the question is asking for the value of x? But no, the answer choices are numerical values. So if QS is 25, then answer D. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that all three lengths are equal? Let me read the constraints again. 

They state:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(R, S)), 6x-5)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(R, Q)), 5x)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(S, Q)), 3x+10)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(R, S)), LengthOf(Line(R, Q)))

Equals(LengthOf(Line(R, Q)), LengthOf(Line(S, Q)))

Ah, yes. So the fourth constraint is that RS equals RQ, and fifth is that RQ equals SQ. Therefore, RS=RQ=SQ. Hence, all three expressions are equal. Thus, solving 6x -5 =5x gives x=5. Then SQ is 3x+10=25. So answer D. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. 25. Let me check answer choices again. Choices are A.5, B.15, C.20, D.25. Yep. So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ QS $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints involving the distances between three points: $ R $, $ S $, and $ Q $. These relationships are expressed algebraically as follows:

$$
\text{Length}(RS) = 6x - 5 \\
\text{Length}(RQ) = 5x \\
\text{Length}(SQ) = 3x + 10
$$

Additionally, we are told:

$$
\text{Length}(RS) = \text{Length}(RQ) \quad \text{(1)} \\
\text{Length}(RQ) = \text{Length}(SQ) \quad \text{(2)}
$$

---

### Step 1: Equating $ RS $ and $ RQ $

Using equation (1):

$$
6x - 5 = 5x
$$

Subtracting $ 5x $ from both sides:

$$
x = 5
$$

---

### Step 2: Verifying Consistency with Equation (2)

Now substitute $ x = 5 $ into the expressions for $ RQ $ and $ SQ $:

$$
\text{Length}(RQ) = 5x = 5(5) = 25 \\
\text{Length}(SQ) = 3x + 10 = 3(5) + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25
$$

Thus, both $ RQ $ and $ SQ $ evaluate to 25, confirming consistency with the second condition.

---

### Step 3: Identifying What Is Being Asked

The question asks for the length of $ QS $, which is the same as the length of $ SQ $. From above, we determined that:

$$
QS = 25
$$

### Final Answer Selection

Among the given choices:

- A. 5  
- B. 15  
- C. 20  
- D. 25  

The correct answer is **25**, corresponding to choice **D**.
