====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the area of the parallelogram based on the given constraints. First, I need to visualize the problem. Let me jot down the given information:

- The length of line DC is 15 units.
- The length of line BE is 5 units.
- The length of line BC is 13 units.
- Point E lies on line AB.
- Lines CE and EB are perpendicular.

Wait, so we have points A, B, C, D, E. And it's mentioned that there's a parallelogram. But which sides are forming the parallelogram? Hmm. Since they mention a parallelogram, maybe ABCD is the parallelogram? Or perhaps another combination?

But first, let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Since there are perpendicular lines involved, coordinate geometry might be useful here.

Let me start by setting up a coordinate system. Let's assume point B is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since point E lies on line AB, and BE has length 5. Wait, but AB isn't specified yet. However, since E is on AB, and BE is 5, then AE would be AB minus BE, but without knowing AB's length, maybe we need more info.

Also, CE is perpendicular to EB. So triangle CEB is a right triangle? Because CE ⊥ EB. Therefore, triangle CEB is right-angled at E. So CE is one leg, EB is another leg, and CB is the hypotenuse. Wait, but CB is given as 13 units. Let me check that.

Given that LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 13. If triangle CEB is right-angled at E, then by Pythagoras, CE² + EB² = CB². Plugging in the known values:

CE² + 5² = 13² → CE² + 25 = 169 → CE² = 144 → CE = 12. So CE is 12 units long.

So CE = 12, BE = 5, CB = 13. That makes sense because 5-12-13 is a classic Pythagorean triple.

Now, since CE is perpendicular to EB, and E lies on AB, maybe we can assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me place point B at (0,0). Let me suppose that line AB is along the x-axis. Then point E is somewhere on AB. Since BE = 5, and assuming direction, let's say E is between A and B? Or could be extended beyond? Not sure yet. Let me try.

If AB is horizontal, then coordinates of B are (0,0). Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s assume E is at some point on AB. Let me define coordinates for E. Suppose AB is the x-axis, so point B is at (0,0), and point A is at (-a, 0) for some positive a. Then point E lies on AB, so its coordinates would be somewhere between A and B or outside. Since BE = 5, and B is at (0,0), then E is at (x, 0) such that distance from B to E is 5. So E could be at (5, 0) or (-5, 0), depending on direction. Wait, but if E is between A and B, then depending on where A is. Alternatively, maybe E is beyond B?

Alternatively, maybe I should take AB as a line, with E lying on it. Let me pick coordinates where B is (0,0) and E is at (5, 0) because BE is 5. Wait, but then AB is a line containing E. So if E is on AB, then AB could extend beyond E. Let me fix this.

Let me set up coordinates:

Let me take point B at (0, 0).

Since BE = 5, and E lies on AB, let me assume AB is along the x-axis. Let me take E at (5, 0). Then point A is somewhere on the x-axis; but since E is on AB, A could be to the left of E or right. Wait, if E is between A and B, then A would be to the left of E. For example, if A is at (-k, 0), then AB goes from A(-k, 0) through E(5,0) to B(0,0). Wait, but then the distance from B to E is 5 units. So if B is at (0,0), then E is at (5,0), so the distance BE is 5 units. Then AB would be from A to B, passing through E. So if E is between A and B, then A would be to the left of E. But then the distance from A to B would be longer than BE. Alternatively, E could be beyond B, but then the distance from B to E would still be 5. Either way, coordinates can be chosen accordingly.

But since CE is perpendicular to EB. Let me consider that. If EB is along the x-axis from B(0,0) to E(5,0), then CE is perpendicular to EB. Since EB is horizontal, CE must be vertical. Therefore, CE is vertical. Therefore, point C must lie somewhere along the vertical line passing through E. Because CE is perpendicular to EB (which is horizontal), so CE is vertical.

Therefore, since E is at (5,0), and CE is vertical, then point C has the same x-coordinate as E, which is 5. So coordinates of C would be (5, y) for some y. Now, the length of CE is 12. Since E is at (5,0), and C is at (5,y), then CE is |y - 0| = |y|. Given that CE is 12, so y = 12 or y = -12. Let's assume it's above the x-axis, so y=12. So point C is at (5, 12).

Then, we also know that the length of DC is 15. We need to determine coordinates of D. Since ABCD is a parallelogram? Wait, the question says "the area of the parallelogram." Which parallelogram? It's possible that the parallelogram is ABCD, or maybe another one. Wait, given points A, B, C, D. Let me think.

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, diagonals bisect each other. But since we have points A, B, C, D, and we have DC as a side. So if ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB is parallel and equal to CD, and AD is parallel and equal to BC. But we need to verify if that's the case.

But wait, we don't know yet whether ABCD is a parallelogram. Wait, the problem says "the area of the parallelogram," so maybe the figure formed by these points is a parallelogram. But we need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is ACBD or something else. Wait, but given that DC is 15. So if DC is a side, then maybe ABCD is the parallelogram. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Assuming ABCD is a parallelogram. In that case, vector AB equals vector DC. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So AB is congruent and parallel to DC, and AD congruent and parallel to BC.

We already have coordinates for B(0,0), E(5,0), C(5,12). Let me find coordinates for point D.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, then vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is from A to B, which is B - A. Wait, if A is at (-k, 0), then vector AB is (0 - (-k), 0 - 0) = (k, 0). Vector DC is from D to C, which would be C - D. So if AB equals DC, then DC = AB. Therefore, vector DC = (k, 0). Therefore, if point D is (x, y), then vector DC is (5 - x, 12 - y) = (k, 0). So:

5 - x = k,

and 12 - y = 0 => y = 12.

Therefore, point D has coordinates (5 - k, 12). Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, another condition is that vector AD equals vector BC.

Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(5,12): (5,12). Vector AD is from A(-k,0) to D(5 - k, 12): (5 - k - (-k), 12 - 0) = (5, 12). So yes, vector AD equals vector BC. So that checks out.

Therefore, coordinates of D are (5 - k, 12). Now, we need to find k. How?

Well, we need another equation. What else do we know? The length of DC is 15. Wait, DC is given as 15. Wait, DC is the length of line segment DC. From D(5 - k, 12) to C(5,12). The distance between those two points is sqrt[(5 - (5 - k))² + (12 - 12)^2] = sqrt[(k)^2 + 0] = |k|. Therefore, DC = |k| = 15. Hence, k = ±15. 

But since in our earlier setup, point A was assumed to be at (-k, 0). Depending on the direction, k could be positive or negative. But since lengths are positive, we take absolute value. So k = 15. Therefore, point A is at (-15, 0). 

Thus, coordinates:

A(-15, 0)

B(0,0)

E(5, 0)

C(5, 12)

D(5 - 15, 12) = (-10, 12)

Now, we can compute the area of parallelogram ABCD. One way to calculate the area is base times height. Alternatively, using vectors or coordinates.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, the area can be found via the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AD.

First, vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (0 - (-15), 0 - 0) = (15, 0)

Vector AD is from A to D: D - A = (-10 - (-15), 12 - 0) = (5, 12)

The area is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors, which is |AB_x * AD_y - AB_y * AD_x|

So that's |15*12 - 0*5| = |180 - 0| = 180. So the area is 180.

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 180. So that seems like the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, confirming coordinates:

- AB is from (-15,0) to (0,0), so AB length is 15, which matches DC being 15. Correct.

- BE is from B(0,0) to E(5,0), length 5. Correct.

- BC is from (0,0) to (5,12). Distance is sqrt(5² + 12²) = sqrt(25+144)=sqrt(169)=13. Correct.

- CE is from (5,0) to (5,12), length 12. Correct.

- Perpendicularity: CE is vertical, EB is horizontal, so they are perpendicular. Correct.

Coordinates of D: (-10,12). So DC is from D(-10,12) to C(5,12), which is 15 units horizontally, correct. 

Area calculation: Using vectors AB (15,0) and AD (5,12). Cross product gives 15*12 - 0*5 = 180. Absolute value is 180. Yes.

Another way: base * height. Take AB as base, which is 15 units. Height is the perpendicular distance from D to AB. Since AB is along the x-axis, the y-coordinate of D is 12, so height is 12. Area is 15*12=180. Same result.

Hence, the area is 180, which corresponds to answer choice B.

I think that's solid. No mistakes detected here. So the answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the **area of the parallelogram**, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and assigning appropriate coordinates to the points to simplify the problem.

---

### Step 1: Assign Coordinates Based on Constraints

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(DC) = 15 $
- $ \text{Length}(BE) = 5 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 13 $
- $ E $ lies on line $ AB $
- $ \angle CEB = 90^\circ $

This implies that triangle $ CEB $ is a right triangle with legs $ CE $ and $ BE $, and hypotenuse $ BC $. This allows us to use the **Pythagorean theorem**:

$$
CE^2 + BE^2 = BC^2 \\
\Rightarrow CE^2 + 5^2 = 13^2 \\
\Rightarrow CE^2 = 169 - 25 = 144 \Rightarrow CE = 12
$$

---

### Step 2: Coordinate Setup

Let’s place the points in a coordinate plane:

- Place **point B** at the origin: $ B = (0, 0) $
- Since $ BE = 5 $ and lies on line $ AB $, place **point E** at $ (5, 0) $ (assume $ AB $ is horizontal)
- Since $ \angle CEB = 90^\circ $, and $ BE $ is horizontal, then $ CE $ is vertical. Thus, **point C** lies directly above or below $ E $, i.e., $ C = (5, 12) $ (we choose upward for simplicity)

Now, we know:
- $ C = (5, 12) $
- $ E = (5, 0) $
- $ B = (0, 0) $

Next, determine **point D** such that $ DC = 15 $ and the shape forms a **parallelogram**. Assume the parallelogram is $ ABCD $, so:

- Opposite sides are equal and parallel: $ AB \parallel DC $, $ AD \parallel BC $
- So, vector $ \vec{AB} = \vec{DC} $

Let’s find coordinates of **point A** and **point D**:

#### Finding Point A
Let’s assume $ A = (x, 0) $ on the x-axis (since $ AB $ is horizontal). Then:

$$
\vec{AB} = (0 - x, 0 - 0) = (-x, 0)
$$

Since $ \vec{DC} = (5 - x_D, 12 - y_D) $, and we want $ \vec{AB} = \vec{DC} $, equating components:

$$
\begin{cases}
5 - x_D = -x \\
12 - y_D = 0
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow 
\begin{cases}
x_D = 5 + x \\
y_D = 12
\end{cases}
$$

From the constraint $ DC = 15 $, the distance between $ D $ and $ C $ is:

$$
\text{Distance}(D, C) = \sqrt{(x_C - x_D)^2 + (y_C - y_D)^2} = \sqrt{(5 - x_D)^2 + (12 - 12)^2} = |5 - x_D|
$$

Set this equal to 15:

$$
|5 - x_D| = 15 \Rightarrow x_D = 5 \pm 15
$$

Since $ x_D = 5 + x $, solving:

$$
5 + x = 5 + 15 \Rightarrow x = 15 \quad \text{(or } x = -15 \text{)}
$$

Choosing the positive value for consistency, let’s take $ x = -15 \Rightarrow A = (-15, 0) $

Then:

$$
x_D = 5 + (-15) = -10 \Rightarrow D = (-10, 12)
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Area of Parallelogram $ ABCD $

Use the **cross product method** for area of a parallelogram defined by vectors:

- Vector $ \vec{AB} = (15, 0) $
- Vector $ \vec{AD} = (5, 12) $

Area is:

$$
\text{Area} = |\vec{AB}_x \cdot \vec{AD}_y - \vec{AB}_y \cdot \vec{AD}_x| = |15 \cdot 12 - 0 \cdot 5| = |180| = 180
$$

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
