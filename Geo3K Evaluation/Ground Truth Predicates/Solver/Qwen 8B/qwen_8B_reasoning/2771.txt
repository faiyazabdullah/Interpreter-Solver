MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. There are several points mentioned: A, B, C, D, E, F. The lines involved include AC, AE, CD, BD, EF, etc. Also, there are some parallel lines (AE || CD) and point relationships like F lying on line AC, B lying on line ED, and some equal lengths between segments.

Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. Length of CD = 6x + 4
2. Length of AE = 10x - 2
3. Length of FB = 5x + 10
4. Point F lies on line AC
5. Point B lies on line ED
6. Length of CF equals length of BD
7. Length of EB equals length of AF
8. Lines AE and CD are parallel.

Hmm. So since AE is parallel to CD, maybe we can use similar triangles or something related to parallel lines? But first, let me note down the equations involving lengths.

We have two expressions for lengths that might relate through these constraints. Let's see.

First, since F is on AC, then AF + FC = AC. Similarly, since B is on ED, maybe EB + BD = ED? Wait, but we don't know about ED's length yet. However, there's another condition that EB equals AF. And also CF equals BD.

So let me write down the variables.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables for each segment:

Let’s say:

AF = y (some value)

Then, since EB = AF, so EB = y.

Also, since CF = BD, let's call CF = BD = z.

But since F is on AC, then AF + FC = AC => y + z = AC.

Similarly, since B is on ED, then EB + BD = ED => y + z = ED.

Wait, so AC = ED?

Is there a reason why AC would equal ED? Not sure yet. Maybe through the parallel lines?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle similarities because of the parallel lines?

Since AE || CD, which suggests that maybe there are transversals creating similar triangles.

Wait, let me think. If lines AE and CD are parallel, and there are other lines intersecting them, like maybe EC and AD? Or maybe BF and something else?

Alternatively, maybe considering coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points to model the situation?

That might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, using vectors or ratios.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, then maybe the ratio of AE/CD equals the ratio of their corresponding sides in some triangle?

Wait, but without knowing which triangles, it's hard to tell. Let me try to find relations between the given lengths.

Given that AE || CD, so maybe there's a trapezoid here? Like AE and CD being the two bases of a trapezoid, with other sides connecting them.

But points A and C are connected via line AC. Points E and D are connected via line ED. Also, point B is on ED, and F is on AC.

Additionally, there's a relation between CF and BD, as well as EB and AF.

Let me try to express everything in terms of x, since all the lengths are given in terms of x.

We have:

Length CD = 6x + 4

Length AE = 10x - 2

Length FB = 5x + 10

Also, from the conditions:

CF = BD

EB = AF

And since F is on AC, AF + FC = AC. Therefore, AF + CF = AC. Since CF = BD, then AF + BD = AC. But BD is part of ED, since B is on ED. So BD = ED - EB. Because ED = EB + BD. Since EB = AF, then BD = ED - AF. Therefore substituting into AF + BD = AC gives AF + (ED - AF) = ED = AC. Therefore, AC = ED. So AC equals ED. Interesting.

Therefore, AC = ED. So the length of AC equals the length of ED.

But how do we connect this with the rest?

Let me think. Let's consider the lines AE and CD being parallel. Suppose we have lines AE and CD, which are parallel. Then, if we can find some relationship between the lengths of AE and CD, perhaps using similar triangles or intercept theorem (Thales' theorem).

If lines AE and CD are parallel, then maybe the triangles formed by the transversal lines would be similar.

For example, suppose we consider the intersection points of lines connecting other points. For instance, if lines AC and ED intersect at some point, but since F is on AC and B is on ED, maybe lines AB or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the lines AC and ED are cut by the parallel lines AE and CD?

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles with the parallel lines.

Suppose we imagine that lines AE and CD are parallel, and they are cut by the transversal AC and ED. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, then the ratio of AE to CD should be equal to the ratio of distances between the lines along some direction.

But perhaps more directly, using coordinates.

Let me assign coordinate system to make things clearer.

Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since AE is a line; let me assume that AE is horizontal for simplicity, given that CD is parallel to AE. Wait, but I need to make sure that AE and CD are both horizontal if I set AE as horizontal.

Alternatively, maybe better to use vector approach.

But maybe coordinates could work. Let me try.

Let me set coordinate system such that line AE is horizontal. Let me assume that point A is at (0, 0) and point E is at (k, 0) for some k. Since AE has length 10x - 2, so the distance between A and E is |k - 0| = k = 10x - 2. Therefore, k = 10x - 2.

Now, since CD is parallel to AE, so CD is also horizontal. Let me assume that line CD is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates to points C and D. Let me suppose that line CD is somewhere above or below AE.

But also, point F lies on line AC, and point B lies on line ED.

Moreover, there's a relation between CF and BD. Also, EB equals AF.

This seems complex. Let me proceed step by step.

First, let me fix coordinates for points A and E:

Let me take A at (0, 0), and E at (e, 0), where e = 10x - 2.

Now, since CD is parallel to AE (which is horizontal), CD is also horizontal. Let me assign coordinates to points C and D. Let me assume that line CD is horizontal at some y-coordinate. Let me pick coordinates for C as (c_x, h) and D as (d_x, h), so that CD has length d_x - c_x = 6x + 4.

But I need to relate these coordinates with other points.

Point F lies on line AC. Let me parametrize line AC. Since A is (0, 0) and C is (c_x, h), the parametric equation of AC can be written as (tc_x, th) where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Point F is somewhere on AC, so its coordinates can be expressed as (t*c_x, t*h) for some t between 0 and 1.

Similarly, point B lies on line ED. Let me find coordinates for line ED. Since E is at (e, 0) and D is at (d_x, h). So parametric equations for ED can be written as (e + s*(d_x - e), 0 + s*(h - 0)) = (e + s(d_x - e), sh), where s ranges from 0 to 1.

So point B is somewhere on ED, so its coordinates can be expressed as (e + s(d_x - e), sh) for some parameter s.

Now, we have the condition that CF = BD.

First, let's compute CF. Point C is (c_x, h), and F is (t*c_x, t*h). So vector CF is (t*c_x - c_x, t*h - h) = (c_x(t - 1), h(t - 1)). The length of CF is sqrt[ (c_x^2(t - 1)^2 + h^2(t - 1)^2 ) ] = |t - 1| * sqrt(c_x² + h²). Alternatively, since the length squared would be (t - 1)^2 (c_x² + h²).

But maybe instead of coordinates, I can relate using ratios. Since F is on AC, CF / AF = ?

Wait, AF + CF = AC. So AF = t*AC, CF = (1 - t)*AC? No, wait. If F divides AC such that AF = t*AC, then CF = AC - AF = (1 - t) AC. But depending on how t is defined.

Alternatively, if we take t as the fraction from A to C, then AF = t*AC, CF = (1 - t)*AC. So CF = (1 - t) AC. Similarly, BD is the length from B to D on ED. Since B is on ED, BD = (1 - s) ED, assuming s is the fraction from E to D. Wait, no. If B is at parameter s along ED from E to D, then EB = s*ED, and BD = (1 - s) ED. So BD = (1 - s) ED.

But according to the constraint, CF = BD. So (1 - t) AC = (1 - s) ED.

Also, we have another condition: EB = AF.

EB is the length from E to B. Since B is on ED, and EB = s*ED. AF is the length from A to F, which is t*AC. So s*ED = t*AC.

So we have two equations:

1. (1 - t) AC = (1 - s) ED
2. s ED = t AC

From equation 2: s ED = t AC → s = (t AC)/ED

Substitute into equation 1:

(1 - t) AC = (1 - (t AC)/ED ) ED

Expanding RHS: ED - t AC

Thus:

(1 - t) AC = ED - t AC

Bring all terms to left side:

(1 - t) AC - ED + t AC = 0 → [ (1 - t) + t ] AC - ED = 0 → AC - ED = 0 → AC = ED

Which confirms our earlier conclusion that AC = ED.

Therefore, AC = ED. Now, we need to find expressions for AC and ED in terms of x.

But how?

Well, AC is the length from A to C. Earlier, we had set A at (0,0), and C at (c_x, h). So AC = sqrt( (c_x)^2 + h^2 ). But we don't know c_x and h yet.

Similarly, ED is the length from E to D. E is at (e, 0), D is at (d_x, h). So ED = sqrt( (d_x - e)^2 + (h)^2 )

But unless we have more info, we can't determine these values. Perhaps there's another way.

Wait, but maybe we can find relations between the coordinates using the fact that AE || CD. Since AE is horizontal (from earlier assumption), and CD is also horizontal. Therefore, their slopes are zero, which matches.

But maybe we can relate the positions of C and D with respect to A and E?

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or similarity.

Wait, since AE || CD, and points F and B lie on AC and ED respectively, maybe there's a proportionality.

Another thought: since AE || CD, then the triangles formed by connecting these points may be similar.

For example, if we consider lines AF and BE... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, the ratio of AE to CD should be equal to the ratio of AF to CF or something like that.

Wait, if we think of AE and CD as two parallel lines, and lines AC and ED as transversals intersecting them. Then, the ratio of AE / CD should be equal to the ratio of AF / FC or something like that.

Yes! That sounds promising. In similar triangles, when you have two parallel lines cut by two transversals, the ratios of the segments are proportional.

But let me recall the exact theorem. If two lines are cut by two transversals, and the lines are parallel, then the ratio of the segments on one transversal equals the ratio on the other.

In particular, if we have two parallel lines, AE and CD, and two transversals AC and ED intersecting them, then the ratio of AE / CD = AF / FC = EB / BD.

Wait, let me check.

Imagine lines AE and CD are parallel. Transversal AC intersects AE at A and CD at C. Transversal ED intersects AE at E and CD at D. Then, the ratio of AE / CD should equal AF / FC, where F is the intersection point of AC and ED? Wait, but in our case, F is on AC, and B is on ED. Wait, maybe not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, then the triangles AFE and CFD might be similar? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that AE || CD implies that the ratio of AE to CD equals the ratio of AF to FC.

Wait, if we consider that the lines AE and CD are cut by the transversal AC, then the ratio of AE to CD would be equal to the ratio of AF to FC. Is that true?

Actually, yes! When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the ratio of the lengths of the segments on one line is equal to the ratio of the segments on the other line. Wait, but here AE and CD are the two parallel lines, and the transversal is AC. So, point A is on AE, point C is on CD. So the ratio of EA / CD would be equal to the ratio of AF / FC? Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe the formula is that if two lines are cut by a transversal, then the ratio of the segments on the transversal is equal to the ratio of the segments on the other transversal. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry. Since AE is parallel to CD, which are horizontal lines in my coordinate setup. So AE has length 10x - 2, CD has length 6x + 4. If I can relate their lengths to the position of F and B.

Earlier, I had that AF = EB and CF = BD. Also, AC = ED.

But AC and ED are equal. So AC = ED.

But AC is the length from A to C, and ED is the length from E to D.

But if I can express AC and ED in terms of other quantities?

Alternatively, since AE || CD, then the distance between the lines AE and CD is constant. However, without knowing specific coordinates, this might not help directly.

Wait, but perhaps using vectors. Let me think.

Vector AE is from A to E: E - A = (e, 0) - (0, 0) = (e, 0). Vector CD is from C to D: D - C = (d_x - c_x, 0). Since AE || CD, their direction vectors are scalar multiples. Since AE is horizontal, CD must also be horizontal, which we already assumed.

But how does this help us?

Maybe considering the entire configuration. Since F is on AC and B is on ED, and EB = AF, CF = BD.

Let me consider expressing AF and EB in terms of x.

We have AF = EB, and CF = BD.

Also, since AC = ED, as established before.

Let me denote AF = EB = m, and CF = BD = n.

So, AF + CF = AC ⇒ m + n = AC.

Similarly, EB + BD = ED ⇒ m + n = ED. Which confirms AC = ED.

But how to relate m and n to the given lengths?

We also have the lengths of AE and CD.

Since AE is parallel to CD, and if we think about the triangles formed by the lines...

Wait, maybe using the fact that AE || CD, so the ratio of AE to CD is equal to the ratio of AF to FC.

Because if you imagine cutting the two parallel lines with the same transversal AC, then the ratio of AE to CD would be the same as AF to FC.

Wait, let me formalize this.

Assume that AE || CD, and they are cut by the transversal AC. Then, the ratio of the lengths of AE to CD is equal to the ratio of AF to FC.

So:

AE / CD = AF / FC

Plugging in the known values:

(10x - 2) / (6x + 4) = AF / CF

But AF = m, CF = n, so:

(10x - 2)/(6x + 4) = m/n

Also, from the previous relations, we had:

From CF = BD = n, and BD = ED - EB = ED - m.

But ED = AC = m + n.

Therefore, BD = (m + n) - m = n. Which checks out, so no new info.

But we need another equation to relate m and n. Let's see.

Also, we have the length of FB = 5x + 10.

FB is the length from F to B. How can we express FB?

Points F and B are on AC and ED respectively. To find FB, we need to know their coordinates or find a relation between them.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that FB connects F (on AC) and B (on ED), and since AE || CD, perhaps there's a relation between FB and other segments?

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for points, maybe we can express FB in terms of m and n?

But this might require going back to the coordinate system.

Let me try again with coordinates.

Earlier, I placed A at (0,0), E at (e, 0) where e = 10x - 2.

Let me assume that line CD is horizontal at height h, so C is at (p, h), D is at (q, h), so CD has length q - p = 6x + 4.

Now, point F is on AC. Parametrize AC: from A(0,0) to C(p, h). Let me write parametric equations for AC: any point on AC can be represented as (tp, th), where t ∈ [0, 1].

Similarly, point B is on ED. ED goes from E(e, 0) to D(q, h). Parametrize ED: any point on ED can be represented as (e + s(q - e), 0 + s(h - 0)) = (e + s(q - e), sh), where s ∈ [0, 1].

Now, we have the conditions:

1. CF = BD
2. EB = AF

Let me compute AF and EB.

AF is the length from A(0,0) to F(tp, th): √[(tp)^2 + (th)^2]. But since AF = m, and CF = n, and AC = m + n.

But maybe instead of working with coordinates, let's use parameters t and s.

Let me define t such that F divides AC in the ratio t:(1-t), meaning AF = t * AC, and CF = (1 - t) * AC.

Similarly, point B divides ED such that EB = s * ED, BD = (1 - s) * ED.

From earlier, we have:

EB = AF → s * ED = t * AC → s = (t * AC)/ED

And CF = BD → (1 - t) AC = (1 - s) ED.

Substituting s from above:

(1 - t) AC = [1 - (t AC)/ED] ED

Expand RHS: ED - t AC

So:

(1 - t) AC = ED - t AC → Bring terms together:

(1 - t) AC + t AC = ED → AC = ED

Which we already knew.

But we need another relation to find t or s. Let's think.

Also, we have the length FB = 5x + 10. Let me express FB in terms of t and s.

Coordinates of F: (tp, th)

Coordinates of B: (e + s(q - e), sh)

Distance FB squared is [e + s(q - e) - tp]^2 + [sh - th]^2.

But this seems too abstract. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, and we've set up coordinates with AE horizontal, CD horizontal, then the vertical difference between AE and CD is h. So the distance between the lines AE and CD is h.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe considering the slope of FB? Since AE || CD, and FB connects F and B, but I don't see immediately.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that FB connects points on AC and ED, which are transversals, and since AE || CD, then FB could be parallel to something?

Not sure.

Alternatively, since we have multiple expressions involving x, perhaps we can find another equation involving x.

Recall that we have the length of FB = 5x + 10. So if we can express FB in terms of x, we can solve for x.

To find FB, we need to relate the coordinates of F and B. But without knowing specific values for p, q, e, h, it's challenging.

Wait, but perhaps we can find relations between p, q, e, h through the parallelism and other constraints.

Since AE || CD, and AE is horizontal, CD is horizontal, so their slopes are zero. But also, the line AC connects A(0,0) to C(p, h). The slope of AC is h/p.

Similarly, line ED connects E(e, 0) to D(q, h). Slope of ED is (h - 0)/(q - e) = h/(q - e).

Are there any relations between these slopes? Not necessarily, unless there is another condition.

Alternatively, since AE || CD, and lines AC and ED are transversals, maybe there's a relation between the slopes of AC and ED?

Not necessarily, unless there's a specific condition.

Alternatively, maybe using mass point geometry or something else.

Wait, but let me think differently. We have AC = ED, which we derived earlier. So AC = ED. What is AC?

AC is the distance from A(0,0) to C(p,h): √(p² + h²)

ED is the distance from E(e,0) to D(q,h): √[(q - e)² + h²]

Setting them equal:

√(p² + h²) = √[(q - e)² + h²]

Square both sides:

p² + h² = (q - e)² + h² → p² = (q - e)² → p = ±(q - e)

So either p = q - e or p = -(q - e).

But since we're dealing with lengths, probably p = q - e, assuming positive directions.

So p = q - e.

But remember that CD has length q - p = 6x + 4. Substituting p = q - e:

q - p = q - (q - e) = e = 6x + 4.

But earlier, e was defined as the length of AE, which is 10x - 2. So e = 10x - 2.

Therefore:

e = 6x + 4 → 10x - 2 = 6x + 4 → Solve for x:

10x - 2 = 6x + 4 → 10x - 6x = 4 + 2 → 4x = 6 → x = 6/4 = 3/2 = 1.5.

Wait, but this would give x=1.5, which isn't among the answer choices (A is 3, B is 22, etc.). So something is wrong here.

Wait, this suggests that my assumption that p = q - e leads to x = 1.5, which is not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Let me retrace.

I said that AC = ED, leading to p² + h² = (q - e)^2 + h² → p² = (q - e)^2 → p = ±(q - e). 

But if I take p = q - e, then q - p = e = 6x + 4, and e is also equal to AE's length, which is 10x - 2. Hence:

e = 6x + 4 = 10x - 2 → solving gives x = 6/4 = 1.5. But this conflicts with the answer choices. So there must be a mistake in reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Here's the error: When I equated AC = ED, I concluded that p² + h² = (q - e)^2 + h², hence p² = (q - e)^2. But this assumes that the y-coordinates are the same, which they aren't. Wait, no, in the coordinate system, point C is at (p, h), D is at (q, h), so the y-coordinate is h for both. Point E is at (e, 0), and point A is at (0, 0). So ED is from (e, 0) to (q, h). So the length ED is sqrt[(q - e)^2 + (h)^2], while AC is sqrt[p² + h²]. Setting them equal gives p² + h² = (q - e)^2 + h² → p² = (q - e)^2 → p = ±(q - e).

But this doesn't involve the length CD. Wait, CD is from C(p, h) to D(q, h), so length CD is q - p = 6x + 4. Since p = ±(q - e), then:

Case 1: p = q - e → q - p = e = 6x + 4 → but e is AE's length, which is 10x - 2. Hence:

10x - 2 = 6x + 4 → 4x = 6 → x = 1.5

Case 2: p = -(q - e) → p = e - q → q - p = q - (e - q) = 2q - e. But CD length is q - p = 6x + 4 = 2q - e → 2q = 6x + 4 + e.

But we don't know q or e. So this case introduces more variables. However, since this case leads to more unknowns, perhaps Case 1 is the valid one, giving x = 1.5, which is not among the answer choices. This suggests an error in assumptions.

Wait, but the answer choices are integers: 3, 22, 25, 28. So x = 1.5 is not among them. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me reconsider the assumption that AC = ED. Where did that come from?

Earlier, I deduced that AC = ED because AF + CF = AC and EB + BD = ED, and CF = BD, EB = AF. So AC = ED. But is that always true?

Let me re-examine:

From AF + CF = AC.

From EB + BD = ED.

Given that CF = BD and EB = AF.

Substitute CF = BD into the first equation: AF + BD = AC.

Substitute EB = AF into the second equation: AF + BD = ED.

Hence, AC = ED. So this is correct.

So AC = ED.

But in the coordinate system, AC = sqrt(p² + h²), ED = sqrt((q - e)^2 + h²). So setting them equal gives p² = (q - e)^2, leading to p = ±(q - e).

But CD length is q - p = 6x + 4.

So if p = q - e, then q - p = e = 6x + 4. But e is the length AE, which is 10x - 2. So:

10x - 2 = 6x + 4 → x = 6/4 = 1.5. Still the same issue.

But since this leads to x = 1.5, which is not an option, there must be an error in the logic.

Wait, but maybe my coordinate assumption is flawed. I assumed that AE is horizontal, and CD is horizontal. But what if the lines AE and CD are not horizontal? Wait, no, since they are parallel, if I chose AE to be horizontal, then CD is also horizontal. So that should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe there is another relation involving FB?

The length of FB is given as 5x + 10. Maybe I can express FB in terms of x using the previous relations.

Let me attempt that.

Earlier, I had that p = q - e, from the equality AC = ED.

With p = q - e, and q - p = e = 6x + 4. But e = 10x - 2. So:

10x - 2 = 6x + 4 → x = 1.5. But since this is not an option, perhaps I need to revisit the assumption that p = q - e. What if p = -(q - e)? Let's explore that.

Case 2: p = -(q - e) → p = e - q.

Then, CD length is q - p = q - (e - q) = 2q - e = 6x + 4.

So 2q = 6x + 4 + e → q = (6x + 4 + e)/2.

But e = 10x - 2, so substitute:

q = (6x + 4 + 10x - 2)/2 = (16x + 2)/2 = 8x + 1.

So q = 8x + 1.

Now, AC = sqrt(p² + h²) = sqrt[(e - q)^2 + h²] = sqrt[(10x - 2 - q)^2 + h²]. But since p = e - q, and q = 8x + 1, then e - q = 10x - 2 - (8x + 1) = 2x - 3.

So AC = sqrt[(2x - 3)^2 + h²].

ED = sqrt[(q - e)^2 + h²] = sqrt[(8x + 1 - (10x - 2))^2 + h²] = sqrt[(-2x + 3)^2 + h²] = sqrt[(2x - 3)^2 + h²], which equals AC. So that holds.

Now, CD length is 6x + 4, which is q - p = 2q - e = 2(8x + 1) - (10x - 2) = 16x + 2 - 10x + 2 = 6x + 4. Correct.

So this case is consistent.

Now, how to find h?

We need another equation. Let's recall that FB = 5x + 10.

To find FB, we need coordinates of F and B.

Point F is on AC. From earlier, AC goes from A(0,0) to C(p, h), where p = e - q = 10x - 2 - q. But q = 8x + 1, so p = 10x - 2 - 8x - 1 = 2x - 3.

So p = 2x - 3.

So point C is at (p, h) = (2x - 3, h).

Point F is on AC. Let me parameterize F. Let me use parameter t such that F divides AC in ratio t:(1-t). So coordinates of F are (t*p, t*h).

Similarly, point B is on ED. ED goes from E(e, 0) to D(q, h) = (8x + 1, h). Let me parameterize B with parameter s, so coordinates of B are (e + s*(q - e), s*h). 

From earlier, we have:

AF = EB → t * AC = s * ED. Since AC = ED, this simplifies to t = s.

Also, CF = BD → (1 - t) AC = (1 - s) ED → since AC = ED and t = s, this gives (1 - t) AC = (1 - t) AC, which holds.

So now, we can focus on finding FB in terms of t and other variables.

Coordinates of F: (t*p, t*h) = (t*(2x - 3), t*h).

Coordinates of B: (e + s*(q - e), s*h). Since s = t, and e = 10x - 2, q = 8x + 1, q - e = 8x + 1 - (10x - 2) = -2x + 3.

So coordinates of B: (10x - 2 + t*(-2x + 3), t*h).

So now, FB is the distance between F(t*(2x - 3), t*h) and B(10x - 2 - t*(2x - 3), t*h).

Wait, let me calculate:

x-coordinate of B: e + s*(q - e) = (10x - 2) + t*(q - e) = (10x - 2) + t*(-2x + 3).

X-coordinate of F: t*(2x - 3).

Y-coordinate of both F and B is t*h.

So the difference in x-coordinates is [10x - 2 + t*(-2x + 3)] - t*(2x - 3) = 10x - 2 + t*(-2x + 3 - 2x + 3) = 10x - 2 + t*(-4x + 6).

The difference in y-coordinates is t*h - t*h = 0. So FB is purely horizontal, since y-coordinates are the same.

Therefore, FB = |x_B - x_F| = |10x - 2 + t*(-2x + 3) - t*(2x - 3)|.

Let me simplify this expression:

Inside the absolute value:

10x - 2 + t*(-2x + 3 - 2x + 3) = 10x - 2 + t*(-4x + 6).

So FB = |10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)|.

But we also know that FB = 5x + 10.

Thus:

|10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)| = 5x + 10.

Now, we need to find t. How?

Recall that AF = t * AC. Also, AF = EB = s * ED = t * ED = t * AC. So t is a parameter between 0 and 1.

But we need another relation to find t. Let me think.

We have another condition: CF = BD. But we already used that to derive t = s.

Alternatively, since we have FB expressed in terms of t and x, and we need to find x, but we still have t as an unknown.

However, there might be another relation involving t. Let me think.

Wait, what is the length of CF? It is (1 - t) * AC.

But CF is also equal to BD, which is (1 - t) * ED = (1 - t) * AC, so no new info.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate t with something else?

Wait, but we have FB = 5x + 10, and FB = |10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)|. So we can write:

10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6) = ±(5x + 10)

Let me consider both cases.

Case 1: 10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6) = 5x + 10

→ Rearranging:

10x - 2 - 5x - 10 = t*(4x - 6)

→ 5x - 12 = t*(4x - 6)

Case 2: 10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6) = - (5x + 10)

→ 10x - 2 + 5x + 10 = t*(4x - 6)

→ 15x + 8 = t*(4x - 6)

Now, we have two possibilities for t in terms of x. But we need another equation to relate t and x. However, we don't have direct info about t. Unless there's another condition.

Wait, but we also have the length of CD = 6x + 4, which we already used. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, we haven't used the fact that AE || CD. Wait, but we already used that to derive AC = ED and the relations between p, q, e, etc.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation involving the slope of AE and CD? No, since they are parallel, their slopes are equal. But we already ensured that by making them horizontal in the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation involving the coordinates of F and B with the other points?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that FB is horizontal, as we saw earlier, since y-coordinates are the same. So FB is horizontal, which means that the line FB is parallel to AE and CD, which are horizontal. So FB is parallel to AE and CD. Is there any condition on FB? Not directly given, except its length.

But since FB is horizontal, and we have its length as 5x + 10, and we have FB = |10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)|.

But we still have two equations (from case 1 and case 2) and need to find t in terms of x. But how?

Wait, but perhaps there's another relation involving t. Let me think.

We know that point F is on AC, and point B is on ED. But without additional info, it's hard to relate t to anything else.

Wait, unless there's a relation involving the slopes of AF and EB?

No, because AF and EB are not necessarily parallel.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that FB is horizontal, and hence the y-coordinate of F and B are the same. Which we already used.

Alternatively, since FB is horizontal, and AE is horizontal, then FB is parallel to AE and CD. But this is already considered.

Hmm. This seems stuck. Let me think of possible ways to eliminate t.

From Case 1: t = (5x - 12)/(4x - 6)

From Case 2: t = (15x + 8)/(4x - 6)

But t must be between 0 and 1, since it's a parameter along the line from A to C and E to D.

So let's analyze both cases.

Starting with Case 1: t = (5x - 12)/(4x - 6)

We need t to be between 0 and 1.

So:

0 ≤ (5x - 12)/(4x - 6) ≤ 1.

Let's solve for x.

First, denominator 4x - 6 ≠ 0 → x ≠ 6/4 = 1.5.

Also, need to consider the sign of denominator.

Let me consider different intervals for x.

But this might be complex. Let's also keep in mind that answer choices are x = 3, 22, 25, 28. Let's test these values.

Let me try x = 3.

For x = 3:

Case 1: t = (5*3 - 12)/(4*3 - 6) = (15 - 12)/(12 - 6) = 3/6 = 0.5. Valid, since 0 ≤ 0.5 ≤ 1.

So t = 0.5. Let's check if this works.

Also, FB = 5x + 10 = 5*3 + 10 = 25.

But from earlier, FB = |10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)|.

Plug in x = 3, t = 0.5:

10*3 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28.

t*(4x - 6) = 0.5*(12 - 6) = 0.5*6 = 3.

So FB = |28 - 3| = 25. Which matches 5x + 10 = 25. Perfect!

So x = 3 satisfies this case.

Now, let's check if there are other solutions.

Check Case 2: t = (15x + 8)/(4x - 6). Let's see if this can lead to a solution.

Take x = 3:

t = (15*3 + 8)/(12 - 6) = (45 + 8)/6 = 53/6 ≈ 8.833..., which is greater than 1. Not allowed. So invalid.

Try x = 22:

t = (15*22 + 8)/(4*22 - 6) = (330 + 8)/(88 - 6) = 338/82 ≈ 4.1219, also > 1.

x = 25: t = (15*25 + 8)/(100 - 6) = 358/94 ≈ 3.81, >1.

x = 28: t = (15*28 + 8)/(112 - 6) = (420 + 8)/106 = 428/106 ≈ 4.037, >1.

So only x = 3 in Case 1 gives t within [0,1]. Thus, x = 3 is a solution.

But earlier when I assumed p = q - e, I got x = 1.5, but that led to inconsistency. However, in this scenario, with p = e - q (case 2), we found x = 3 is a valid solution. So likely x = 3 is the correct answer, which corresponds to option A.

Let me verify if this is consistent with all given constraints.

Let me confirm with x = 3.

Compute all lengths:

CD = 6x + 4 = 6*3 + 4 = 22.

AE = 10x - 2 = 10*3 - 2 = 28.

FB = 5x + 10 = 5*3 + 10 = 25.

Also, AC = ED. Let's check if AC = ED.

From earlier, in this case, AC = sqrt[(2x - 3)^2 + h²]. With x = 3, 2x - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3. So AC = sqrt(3² + h²) = sqrt(9 + h²).

ED is the same as AC, so sqrt(9 + h²).

Now, FB = 25, which we confirmed.

Also, FB = |10x - 2 - t*(4x - 6)| with x = 3 and t = 0.5:

As before, this gave 25, which matches.

Now, let's check if other constraints hold.

CF = BD. Since t = 0.5, then CF = (1 - t) AC = 0.5 * AC. Similarly, BD = 0.5 * ED = 0.5 * AC, so CF = BD.

EB = AF. Since t = 0.5, AF = 0.5 * AC, and EB = t * ED = 0.5 * ED = 0.5 * AC, so EB = AF.

All conditions are satisfied.

Thus, x = 3 is the correct answer, which is option A.

Therefore, the answer is A.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### **Understanding the Given Constraints**

We are given several geometric constraints involving six points $ A, B, C, D, E, F $, and certain relationships between segments:

1. **Length Relationships**:
   - $ \text{Length}(CD) = 6x + 4 $
   - $ \text{Length}(AE) = 10x - 2 $
   - $ \text{Length}(FB) = 5x + 10 $

2. **Geometric Properties**:
   - $ F $ lies on line $ AC $
   - $ B $ lies on line $ ED $
   - $ \text{Length}(CF) = \text{Length}(BD) $
   - $ \text{Length}(EB) = \text{Length}(AF) $
   - Lines $ AE \parallel CD $

---

#### **Key Geometric Insight**

From the given conditions:
- $ CF = BD $ and $ EB = AF $ imply that the total lengths satisfy:
  $$
  AC = AF + CF = EB + BD = ED
  $$
- So, **$ AC = ED $**
- Additionally, since $ AE \parallel CD $, and these segments are aligned with transversals $ AC $ and $ ED $, this forms a **trapezoid-like structure**, and the **ratio of the segments** on the parallel lines relates to the **transversal segments**.

Using the property of **proportional division by parallel lines**, we apply the following:

> If two parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then the ratio of the segments on one transversal equals the ratio on the other.

Thus,
$$
\frac{AE}{CD} = \frac{AF}{CF}
$$

---

#### **Apply Proportionality**

Substitute the known lengths:

$$
\frac{10x - 2}{6x + 4} = \frac{AF}{CF}
$$

From the given, $ AF = EB $ and $ CF = BD $. Let’s introduce variable names:

Let:
- $ AF = EB = m $
- $ CF = BD = n $

Then:
- $ AC = AF + CF = m + n $
- $ ED = EB + BD = m + n $
- So, $ AC = ED $, confirming consistency.

Also:
$$
\frac{10x - 2}{6x + 4} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

---

#### **Use Segment $ FB $ to Form Equation**

From the diagram, point $ F $ lies on $ AC $, and point $ B $ lies on $ ED $. These points form a segment $ FB $ whose length is given as:
$$
FB = 5x + 10
$$

Through coordinate analysis, we derived the expression:
$$
FB = |10x - 2 - t(4x - 6)|
$$
where $ t $ is a parameter representing the fractional position of $ F $ along segment $ AC $, and $ t = \frac{AF}{AC} = \frac{EB}{ED} $

Set this equal to $ 5x + 10 $, and solve:
$$
|10x - 2 - t(4x - 6)| = 5x + 10
$$

Consider both cases:

##### **Case 1**:  
$$
10x - 2 - t(4x - 6) = 5x + 10
\Rightarrow t = \frac{5x - 12}{4x - 6}
$$

##### **Case 2**:  
$$
10x - 2 - t(4x - 6) = -5x - 10
\Rightarrow t = \frac{15x + 8}{4x - 6}
$$

Only **Case 1** yields a valid value of $ t \in [0, 1] $, which is needed for the points to lie on the segments.

---

#### **Testing with Given Options**

Try $ x = 3 $:

- $ t = \frac{5(3) - 12}{4(3) - 6} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 $
- Compute $ FB $:
  $$
  FB = |10x - 2 - t(4x - 6)| = |30 - 2 - 0.5(6)| = |28 - 3| = 25
  $$
- Check against given: $ FB = 5x + 10 = 5(3) + 10 = 25 $ ✅

Other options fail due to resulting $ t < 0 $ or $ t > 1 $, which violates the segment constraints.
