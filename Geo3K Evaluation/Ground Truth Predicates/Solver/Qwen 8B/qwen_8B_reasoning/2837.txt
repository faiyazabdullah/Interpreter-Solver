MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a parallelogram with some points labeled Y, X, W, Z, and A. The question is asking for the value of 'a' based on the given length constraints and the fact that point A lies on certain lines. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. But I need to figure out how these points are arranged here. Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Z, W)). That suggests that point A is somewhere along both lines YX and ZW. Hmm, but since it's a parallelogram, maybe those lines are the diagonals?

Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint. If A is a point lying on both diagonals, then it must be their intersection point. But usually, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint, so maybe A is the midpoint? Or perhaps A is one of the vertices? Wait, no, because the lengths given involve distances from A to other points. Let me think again.

The problem says that there are lines YA, XA, WA, and AZ. Wait, the LengthOf(Line(Y, A)) is 2, LengthOf(Line(X, A)) is a-7, LengthOf(Line(W, A)) is 10, and LengthOf(Line(A, Z)) is 2b-6. Also, point A lies on line YX and on line ZW. 

So, since A is on line YX, that means that A is a point between Y and X, or maybe extended beyond them? Similarly, A is on line ZW, meaning it's also on that line. Since it's a parallelogram, maybe YX and ZW are two of its sides or diagonals?

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are congruent and parallel. Suppose Y and X are adjacent vertices, and Z and W are others. But the exact configuration might vary. Alternatively, considering that A is on both YX and ZW, which could be the diagonals. For example, if YX and ZW are the diagonals intersecting at A. Then A would be the midpoint of both diagonals. However, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection point is the midpoint. Therefore, if A is the midpoint, then the lengths from A to each endpoint should be equal. Wait, but the given lengths aren't necessarily equal. For instance, YA is 2, XA is a-7, WA is 10, and AZ is 2b-6. If A were the midpoint of diagonal YX, then YA = XA. Similarly, if A is the midpoint of diagonal ZW, then WA = AZ. But according to the given values:

If YA = XA, then 2 = a - 7 => a = 9. And if WA = AZ, then 10 = 2b -6 => 2b = 16 => b=8. But the problem only asks for a, so maybe that's the case. But wait, does that hold?

But first, let me confirm whether YX and ZW are diagonals. Because if they are diagonals, then A being their intersection point (the midpoint) would make sense. However, in a standard parallelogram, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. Let me consider labeling the parallelogram as follows: suppose the vertices are Y, X, Z, W. Wait, but that might not form a parallelogram unless connected properly. Maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the points Y, X, W, Z are arranged such that lines YX and ZW are the diagonals. Let me assume that. Then A is the intersection point of diagonals YX and ZW. Thus, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so A is the midpoint of both diagonals. Hence, YA = XA and WA = AZ. Therefore, from the given lengths:

YA = 2, XA = a -7. So setting them equal: 2 = a -7 → a = 9. Similarly, WA = 10, AZ = 2b -6, so 10 = 2b -6 → 2b = 16 → b = 8. Therefore, a would be 9, which is option C.

But wait, the problem states that the figure is a parallelogram. Are there any other constraints that I'm missing? For example, maybe the sides? Let me check if this assumption holds. If A is the midpoint of both diagonals, then yes, the lengths would be equal. However, another possibility is that A isn't the midpoint but just a point on the diagonals. But in a parallelogram, the diagonals must bisect each other, so if A is the intersection point, it has to be the midpoint. Therefore, the given lengths must satisfy YA = XA and WA = AZ. Therefore, solving for a gives us 9. Which is option C. Let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the lines YX and ZW are not diagonals but sides? Wait, if A lies on YX and ZW, then if YX and ZW are sides, then A would be a point along those sides. But in a parallelogram, sides are connected. For example, if YX is one side, then ZW could be another side. But then A lying on both YX and ZW would imply that YX and ZW intersect at A, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel, so they don't intersect unless they're the same line. Therefore, that can't be. So YX and ZW cannot be sides; they must be diagonals. Hence, my initial thought is correct. Therefore, a = 9. So the answer is C.

But let me double-check. Suppose that the diagonals are YX and ZW, intersecting at A. Then YA = XA and WA = AZ. Therefore, from YA = 2, XA = a -7. So a -7 = 2 → a = 9. That seems straightforward. Therefore, the answer should be C. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 9. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ a $, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and leveraging key properties of parallelograms.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are told that:

- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(Y, A)) = 2 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(X, A)) = a - 7 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(W, A)) = 10 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(A, Z)) = 2b - 6 $

Additionally:

- **Point A lies on Line(Y, X)**  
- **Point A lies on Line(Z, W)**

This implies that point $ A $ is the **intersection** of lines $ YX $ and $ ZW $. Given that these lines pass through the same point $ A $, and knowing that in a **parallelogram**, the **diagonals bisect each other**, we conclude that **lines $ YX $ and $ ZW $ are the diagonals** of the parallelogram, and **point $ A $ is their common midpoint**.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Midpoint Property of Diagonals**

Since $ A $ is the midpoint of both diagonals:

- $ YA = XA $
- $ WA = AZ $

From the given lengths:

- $ YA = 2 $, so $ XA = 2 $
- $ WA = 10 $, so $ AZ = 10 $

Now apply the equality $ XA = a - 7 $, using $ XA = 2 $:

$$
a - 7 = 2 \Rightarrow a = 9
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Verification**

We can verify consistency by checking the second diagonal’s condition:

- $ WA = 10 $, $ AZ = 2b - 6 $
- Setting $ 2b - 6 = 10 $, we find $ b = 8 $, which confirms internal consistency.

Thus, all conditions align with the assumption that $ A $ is the intersection point of the diagonals of the parallelogram.

### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
