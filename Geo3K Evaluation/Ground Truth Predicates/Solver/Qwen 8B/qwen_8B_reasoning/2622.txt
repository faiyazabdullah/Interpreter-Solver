====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have some given constraints and need to find the area of a green figure which is part of similar figures. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the problem mentions two equal lengths: Length of line AD is 8 units, and length of line EG is 4 units. Also, the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 36 square units. The question is about finding the area of the green figure, which I assume is another figure related to these similar shapes. But since there's no diagram, I'll have to make assumptions based on standard problems.

Wait, similar figures usually involve proportions. Since AD is 8 and EG is 4, maybe they're corresponding sides of similar figures? If that's the case, the ratio of similarity would be 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. That means the scale factor between the larger and smaller figure is 2. 

Now, areas of similar figures relate to the square of the scale factor. So if the original area is known, multiplying by the square of the scale factor gives the area of the similar figure. However, the problem states that the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 36. Wait, but which figure is the green one? Maybe the green figure is the smaller similar figure?

But hold on, the problem says "for the pair of similar figures". So perhaps there are two similar figures, one being ABCD (with area 36) and the other being something else, like EFGH or another quadrilateral? But how does EG come into play here?

Let me think again. The length EG is 4, which might correspond to a side in the similar figure. If AD is 8, then EG is half of that. So if AD corresponds to EG, then the ratio is 2:1. Therefore, if ABCD has an area of 36, the similar figure with side EG would have an area scaled by (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 36 * 1/4 = 9. Then the area of the green figure could be 9, which is option A. But wait, why is the green figure the smaller one?

Alternatively, maybe the green figure is the larger one? No, because EG is shorter than AD. Wait, but depending on which figure is which. Suppose ABCD is the larger figure with area 36, and the green figure is the smaller similar figure with side EG=4. Then area would be 36*(1/2)^2 = 9. So answer A.

But maybe there's more to it. Let me check again. Are there any other constraints? The problem mentions quadrilateral ABCD with area 36. If ABCD is similar to another quadrilateral, say, EFGH, then their areas would be in the ratio of the square of their corresponding sides. But we only know one side of each. For example, if AD corresponds to EG, then as before, the ratio is 2:1, leading to area ratio 4:1. Hence, if ABCD is the bigger one with area 36, the smaller one would be 9. So the green figure is likely the smaller one with area 9. So answer A.

Alternatively, if the green figure was the larger one, then area would be 36*4=144, which is option D. But why would EG be part of the smaller figure? Because EG is given as 4, which is half of AD (which is 8). So if EG is a corresponding side, then yes, the smaller figure would have area 9. So probably answer A.

But let me make sure there isn't another approach. Suppose the quadrilateral ABCD is split into parts, and the green figure is another region. Wait, without seeing the diagram, it's tricky, but common problems often use similar triangles or trapezoids. Another thought: maybe ABCD is a parallelogram or rectangle? If ABCD is a parallelogram with base AD=8 and height h, then area is base times height: 8h = 36 => h=4.5. Then if EG is 4, maybe it's a similar figure with same shape, so scaling factor 4/8=0.5, so area scales by 0.25. So 36 * 0.25=9. Again, same result.

Therefore, unless there's a different configuration, the area should be 9. So answer A. But let me check the answer choices again. Option A is 9, B is 18, etc. So I think A is correct. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the correspondence of sides.

Another possibility: if EG is not a corresponding side. Wait, but the problem says "pair of similar figures", so their corresponding sides should be proportional. Given that AD and EG are mentioned, they are most likely corresponding sides. Thus, the ratio is 2:1, leading to area ratio 4:1. So if the green figure is the one with EG, its area is 36 / 4 = 9. So answer A. Yes, that seems consistent.

I don't see any other way to interpret this. So final answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area of the green figure, we begin by analyzing the relationships among the given geometric elements:

---

### **Given Information**

- $ \text{Length}(AD) = 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(EG) = 4 $
- $ \text{Area}(\text{Quadrilateral }ABCD) = 36 $

We are told that the two figures involved are **similar**. This implies that the ratio of corresponding sides is constant, and the ratio of their areas is the **square** of the side-length ratio.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the Scale Factor**

Since $ AD $ and $ EG $ are corresponding sides of similar figures:

$$
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Length}(AD)}{\text{Length}(EG)} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
$$

This tells us that the larger figure is twice as large as the smaller one in terms of linear dimensions.

---

### **Step 2: Use Area Ratio Based on Scale Factor**

The area of similar figures scales with the **square of the scale factor**:

$$
\text{Area Ratio} = (\text{Scale Factor})^2 = 2^2 = 4
$$

So, the area of the **larger figure** is **four times** the area of the **smaller figure**, and vice versa.

---

### **Step 3: Apply to Known Area**

We are told that the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is 36. Assuming that $ABCD$ is the **larger** figure, and the green figure is the **smaller** similar figure (since $EG < AD$), then:

$$
\text{Area of Green Figure} = \frac{36}{4} = 9
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the area of the green figure is $ 9 $. Among the answer choices, the correct selection is:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$

---

**Final Answer: A**
